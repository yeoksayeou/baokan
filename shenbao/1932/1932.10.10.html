<h3>國人對外所家注意之兩大前提　俞頌華</h3>
<p>民國成立以來，國人年年歐慶國慶紀念，其中曾否有一度，因喪地失權，莫展一籌之故，而令人啼笑皆非，如今日者乎。吾人今日縱欲强作歡聲，以慶祝國慶，然回思淞滬血戰，恍如昨日，瘡痍滿目，迄今未復，能不暗然神傷。	更念東北三千萬同胞，一年以來，日在水深火熱中度其亡國破家，悲慘的生活，而莫予拯拔，以至上天無路，入地無門，吾人又能不痛哭失聲乎。去年今日，東北固已被敵侵佔，愁霧陰雲，籠罩全國，無殊今日，然當時國人一面痛憤日本帝國主義之横暴，一面猶冀列强能主持公理，維持國際公法與國際公約，制止日本之侵略，保我領土之完整，故在悲憤中尙有些微之希望與慰安，如今日本已承認滿洲僞國矣，國聯調查團之報告書亦已發表矣，回溯吾國一年來外交上之經過，去年今日之希望與慰安，而今安在哉。</p>
<p>有希望而後有慰安與出路，有慰安與出路，始努力奮發之可能，不然，雖欲努力奮發，亦將無從着手，而茫然不知所措，故今日以前雖有種種失望，自今以往，國人對内對外，良有懲前毖後，另覓出路，以求重新努力奮發之必要，對内如何姑不説，請言對外。</p>
<p>以言對外，則有兩大顯著之前提，爲吾人所不能承認者，其一，即中國之倖存，惟在列强之均勢，此係中國之特殊情形，似屬無庸諱言，在此均勢之下，苟不能自求進步，依自力以圖存，則均勢之局，一有變動，立即發生莫大之危險，非俟均勢之局恢復其平衡之狀態，絶難有苟安之希望，其二，外交上普通最要之原則，莫若力求「孤敵勢,厚已援」國家無論强弱,對於此項原則,胥不能不時時遵循，若不幸而時勢之推移，竟使環境與種種事實，恰恰與此原則相反，無諭强國弱國對外未有不失敗者。</p>
<p>在世界大戰之時，英法俄意德奥諸國，捲入戰爭漩渦，拚命撕殺，無暇東顧，斯時歐洲列强，對於遠東均勢之局，無力維持，日本乃以二十一條欵强迫中國政府簽字，所幸爾時一方美國未即參戰，尙足牽制日本，一方歐洲列强海外之市塲，暫爲美日兩國所奪，日本工商業異常發達，舉國忙於開拓經濟上對外之發展，對於中國，不欲遽用武力侵略，致犠牲其經濟上對外發展之千載難逢之機會，以故均之局，雖起變化，中國尙能苟安。及戰後華盛頓會議告成，列强在遠東新均勢之局面始隨而成就，以對外之情况言，此時爲中國之小康時期，不幸在此新均勢之下，中國仍不長進，末能自强，依自力以圖存，故及夫此新均勢局面發生變化時日本便以武力侵佔我東北，至於華盛頓會議後之新均勢局面，因何發生變化，槪括言之，由於二大根因，（一）經濟恐慌之潮流，遍及世界各國，日本雖未能僥倖，居於例外，然歐美列强，忙於自救，勢窮力促，被其維持遠東新均勢局面之力量因而減削，（二）當倫敦海軍會議時，英美兩國互相聯結，日本在會議中卒不得不稍讓步，而其對於中國之侵略，亦尙有所忌憚，惟不久英國保守黨勢力抬頭，英國改取親法而疏美之方針，加以歐洲多事，各國更自顧不遑，新均勢遂因此爾個根因而有變化，此時日本一面因經濟恐慌，急求出路，一面又鑒於新均勢局面正在動搖，其軍閥派乃乘此時機，急急實現其武力侵略中國之企圖，哀吾國人，當初對於此種國際情勢之變化，未及深加注意，故九一八事變之發生，事前未有切實之準備與對策，事後又空懹列强能助我却敵之妄想，今始恍然，已創巨痛深矣，</p>
<p>其次，在昔德相俾士麥所以能於普丹，普奥，普法諸役迭獲勝利，推本窮源，實由其在外交上能始終貫澈「孤敵勢厚已援」之原則，意相加富爾能使意大利脱離奥法之羈絆，完成統一，夫亦由其能盡力貫澈此原則之故，法國外長德爾加奢嘗本此原則對付德皇威廉第二，後來法國於世界大戰時能獲得多方面有力之援助，亦未始非當初德爾加奢外交政策之功，回顧吾中國近時之外交又如何，當國民革命軍北伐之初國民政府在武漢因有與國之故。嘗於漢口收回英租界，而獲得一度之勝利，其後不但與俄絶交，且於外交軍事都無切實準備，可操勝算之時，爲中東路問題，遽與俄國以干戈相向，由是對外情形，以及列國對我之觀國，爲之一變，夫「打倒帝國主義，」固國民所希望，但絶俄之後，缺乏後援，漫無戒備，而仍唱此口號，徒令敵人，藉爲口實，向列强作種種不利於我之惡宣傳，結果，則於事無補反召列强之忌，諺云，「將石頭來壓自己的脚，」年來吾國之外交，得母類此，吾政府外交上之目的，誠甚正當，爲國民所公認，所雍護，無如所採之方法，竟與歷來各國成功之外交家政治家所採者不同，而事實與環境，又不幸而於不知不覺間，逐漸轉變，使我立於孤立寡助之國際地位，今後設若再不於方法上實事求是，欲達革命外交之目的，竊恐戞戞乎其難矣。</p>
<p>往者不諫，來者可追，吾人今日所希望者，（一）東亞新均勢局勢能再暫時恢復，（二）吾外交當局遵守普通應守之原則，努力進行兩事而已，惟是世界經濟恐慌，其勢滔滔，不知伊於何底，國際情勢又千變萬化，莫能預測。列强能否彼此協調，共同對日，施以壓力，回復遠東之均勢，重造一個可使中國尙可苟安之局面，殊未可必，縱列强有此企圖，然以日本最近不顧一切，一意孤行之情形論，遠東爭端，恐非和平手段所可解决，故第一種希望，一時殊難實現，即實現亦决難完全恢復去年九一八以前之情况，爲免將來再度失望計此，實國人所宜深切注意者，至於第二種希望假如當局果有覺悟，悉力進行，頗有得達之可能，何以言之，蓋日本最近將其帝國主義猙獰之面目，以及獨佔吾東北之野心，盡情畢露，使列强側目，業已自己造成其孤立寡助之國際地位，此實無異自掘墳墓，故吾國今日在外交上當努力者，衹在如何結外援一點而已，且因日本已經孤立寡助，吾以適當之方法，聯絡外援，亦必事半功倍，殆可斷言。</p>
<p>由是言之，可見以上兩種希望，第一種希望不特不易實現，即實現矣，在今日情况之下，亦未必於中國有利，所餘者衹在第二種力求外援耳，然欲求外援，亦有種種條件，其最要者莫，過於自身須有抗敵之决心力最與犠牲精神，以及内部步伐之整齊一致，若自身一無抵抗之决心與努力，同時内部以復糾紛百出，而希望他國爲我犠牲，代我却敵，我則坐享其成，則不惟終無外援可得，反足助長敵人之兇熖，而自貽伊戚，以前種種錯誤，已　成今日時勢危殆，亟亟不可終日之　　情勢，今後豈可一誤再誤，須知早及回頭，改弦易轍，猶爲未晚，果能從此向正確之方向，一致努力，以前之失敗尙可徐圖挽救，而今後漸入佳境，左右逢源，亦非不可期者，否則即使敵人多行不義必自斃，然我東北事能收回，全國又　能免於受人宰割成共管之慘禍，鳴呼同胞，今後雙十節其容我歡慶耶，抑　欲歡慶而不可得耶，惟視吾同胞今日能否體認客觀之事實，矯正過去之失策，下一死裏逃生之决心，一致奮發，努力自救，時乎不再，吾親愛之同胞勉乎哉。</p>
<h3>法律·奮鬥·救國</h3>
<p>今年爲二十度之國慶日。而河山破碎。國勢凌夷。至於如斯。舉國沈痛之不暇。遑言慶祝。惟民國之　基。爲無數先烈所犠牲之代價。我人痛心於現象之惡劣。鑒於先烈締造之非易。其所應自奮自勉者若何。</p>
<p>在昔羅馬時代。平民與貴族爭。奮鬥之結果。有十二碑法之建立。近代法蘭西革命集中中等階级之勢力。推翻封建王國之制度。而後有人權宣言之頒佈。現代俄維斯革命。以勞農階級之團結。繼克倫斯基之後。打倒柴爾專制之勢力。志在獲得勞苦民衆之麵包與和平。縱觀史乘。各民族之奮鬥。均有其特殊環境之驅使。各有其奮鬥之目標。細研究其内容。則其所爭者爲求平等與安全則一也。平等與安全爲人類羣居之生活存修件。爲社會國家之規範的基礎。不平等與不安全之狀態。内則足以摧殘社會之生存。外則足引起敵人之欺侮。是故不平等與不安全。爲無政府狀態之象徵。而安全與平等庶爲法治國家之端倪也。�</p>
<p>辛亥以前。先烈流熱自。擲頭顱。前仆後繼。視死如歸。其意義安在。辛亥以後。歷次鼎革。生命爲之塗炭。其意義又安在。曰。專制時代之帝皇。封建式之軍閥。以及一切禍國殃民之政客。皆爲造成不平等與不安全之因素。而必須有以剷除之。是故不平等與不安全。爲法治之障礙。而我民族近五十年來之奮鬥。殆爲法律而奮鬥。我先烈之犠牲。其意義之深長若彼。而今日現象之黑暗如此。能不令人黯然而神傷。</p>
<p>夫法治之奮鬥。爲自覺的衝動。有自我之覺悟。則　謀自我之生存愈形逼切。人欲奪我之生命。或奪人頼以生存之權利者。我必堅拒之。斯一義也。揆諸個人然。揆諸國家亦然。不觀夫螂臂擋車。困獸猶鬥。彼禽獸尙有掙扎生存之本能。獨我人類反甘自抱棄耶。是故個人爲自我生存而奮鬥。民族爲國家生存而奮鬥。其所爭者。不外乎安全與平等。獲得安全平等以後庶可漸臻於法治。故曰。生存之奮�</p>
<p>鬥史。亦即法律之進化史。民族主義其即法治主義之另一表現乎。</p>
<p>我國内訌不息。外患緊逼。國勢之危岌。莫甚於今日。孰令致之。誰爲之。其原因千頭萬緒。非一語可以破的。而民族自覺心之薄弱。亦一主因。民族無自我之覺悟。就不知法治之可貴。於是東北半壁河山。以拱手讓人。失諸崇朝。反冠以不抵抗主義之美名。於是上下無恢復失地之决心。徒思頼一無能之國聯。於是軍閥在國家存亡危急之秋。猶作　角鬩牆之爭。民族旣無自覺之希望。對外無安全之一日。對内更無安全之企圖。結果惟有自趨於毀滅之一道。</p>
<p>我民族旣鮮有生存之自覺。自缺乏法治之情緒。以致治社會方面種種現象之表顯。莫不與法律秩序格格不相入。試以近事略爲例舉。則牛蘭案以一外人而犯危害國家之罪。竟以其爲「世界學者所關心之人」而累要人之要求保釋。殺張案以罪犯之構成。大快人心。於是要人紛紛電保。冀欲在司法途徑以外了結。惲蕙芳案擲彈警告奸商。以其表面有冀圖殺人之形跡。於是法官斤斤於法文硬性的解釋。而忽略法律之最高理想。此尤爲塋塋大者。其他如非司法機關可以任意下拘捕之命令。不經合法之手續。可以隨意爲扣押之執行。一切行爲旣越出法律之常軌。人民最低限底之安全。就失其保障。以致社會上下。莫不墜入混沌之深淵。耳目之所傳染。皆爲紊絲。心靈之所感觸。莫非悲觀。客觀言之。凡此現象。皆足以催促國家之崩潰。加深危亡之程度也。</p>
<p>或曰。自北伐鼎革以來。法制更新。蔚爲大觀。凡世界文明各國之所有。吾國莫不俱備。而世界各國最新之法規。吾國亦應有盡有。三年來吾國民政府立法成續之偉大與神速。當受世界法學者之所驚奇吾國法治運動之　晋。於此可見斑。孰謂吾國爲無法之國家哉。予曰吾國新頒之法規。連篇累牘。惟其能適合國情者若干。通行無阻者若干。時殊難槪言。即以根本大法之約法。初經領袖間沉痛之爭執。繼之以國民會議之通過。自當字金玉。句句規範。上行而下效。以導全國於法治之正軌。然而最低限度之身體自由的保障。如該法第八條之所謂。「人民非依法律不得逮捕拘禁審問處罰」以及其所附之細則。是否暢行無阻。誠屬極大疑問。碁　他更不遑論。然而人民權利之受奚落。固不足異。惟中央政府旣爲全國之中樞。其權限是否能行施全國。一如約法之所載。其命令是否能通達全國。一如約法之所期。吾人率直而言。亦不能無疑。凡此皆足以證明徒法不足以自行。法治之精義不在條文形式之俱備。而在行之有效的精神。苟作法而毀法。一切公行爲與私行爲莫不擇法外之途徑。而棄法律如糞土。則雖有皇皇之法規。亦徒爲破碎之國家。裝點門楣而已。</p>
<p>或曰今日之亟務。曰抗日。曰勦匪。一言以蔽之。安内攘外而已。孑之所言。得母迂闊。予應曰安内攘外·所爲何事。曰無非確定國家民族之安全而已。安全爲法治之根基。則抗日之爭戰亦即爲法治運動之序幕。彼篾視抗日之舉之意義者。亦即爲篾視法治運動之偉大。蓋抗敵而爭。其意義爲自我人格之維持。而法治之發揚尤頼乎自我覺醒之表現。彼篾視抗日者。不特爲毀滅自己人格之流。抑且爲破壞法治運動之流。此其立論。决非厚誣。惟安内攘外。僅足爲法治立初基。猶未臻法治之堂奥。故必须舉國上下。懇切策勵。在民族生存之掙扎中。不忘法律情緒之培植。</p>
<p>法律情緒之培植。其義若何。曰·規範之確立。形式表現在其次。而對于法律之信仰。當鐫於人人之心坎。使各個人之意識。均充滿法律情緒之質素。於是由個人意識而演爲社會意識。法治庶有不可磨滅之基礎矣。惟法律情緒之培植。不僅�</p>
<p>爲法律學校之責任。不僅爲一切學校敎育之責任。而爲全國上下之責任。必也。全國上下認淸法治爲民族生命之所寄。國家生存之所繫。公私行爲皆當以大衆利益爲前提。整個秩序爲依歸。於是民族之風尙。莫不就範於常軌。民族之全體具有嚴肅之紀律。視法如寳。當法不讓。人人有斯大無畏之法治精神。則外侮不足　。内亂不足平。</p>
<p>或曰。子之所言。得毋牽强附會。等於痴人説夢乎。予應曰。德國法家伊耶陵。子所最　服之一人也。其所著「爲法律而奮鬥」一書。即爲予説之根據。爰引其説。以終吾篇。</p>
<p>「國家欲安内攘外。其唯一之良策。計惟有珍視法律之精神。培植法律之情緒。斯爲政治上生聚敎養之中最高尙之事業。國家生存能力之源泉。對内對外　以生存之最妥善的保障。莫不蕴藏於個個公民之法律情緒中。法律之情緒猶大樹之根源。根源不固。則木將焉附」然則吾之所言。其眞好辯也耶。</p>

<p>而無當。今吾人即棄置軍事資源，運輸能力，新式兵器等較難言之問題於不顧，祇就一般人所注意者而審查之，中國軍之改良，其最必要之條件爲政治有辦法；中國艦隊之擴充，其標誉，爲應有足以防衛全部海岸綫之艦　；中國軍用飛機之添置，至少應與日本之八百架成相當之比例。此三者必需若干萬萬之欵項，若干年月之長時間，並有若干數目之呼種人材，方克有濟，而目前情形，决不許中國有從容廻旋之餘地，以徐　完成此種自衛之計劃也。目前中國自衛問題中最爲急切之形勢所需要者，爲民間武力之儲備。此可就各方面證言之。（一）中國近八十年來武力之中必，由綠營駐防以轉移於湘勇淮軍，由湘勇淮軍以轉移於北洋軍隊，由北洋軍隊以轉移於革命軍人。其新陳代謝之跡，均有歷史事實可考。今者，張學良擁二十萬大軍，不敢對日作抵抗，瀋陽三百架以上購自各國之飛機，貯以資敵，而東北義勇軍，以未經訓練之人民，與挾有新式戰具之日軍，血肉周旋，支持閲月，未嘗稍餒，此國家武力中心轉移於民間之趨勢也。（二）試觀世界各國。戰後之德意志，受條約束縛，表面上國家之軍備，已减至最低限度，惟其民間儲充足之武力，以是戰勝，各國亦不敢輕視其國力。即號稱强大之美利堅，其常備之傭兵，僅用以爲平時之準備，國防主體，乃在民兵。歐洲大戰時，美國以四百萬之大軍，參加對德戰爭，及其復員，正規之常備兵僅二十二萬五千人耳。世界各國中，常備兵力最少者爲中歐之瑞士，然其民間儲備之武力，足使列强有相當之畏懼，故雖迫處德法意奥之間，能免於歐戰之波及，以維持其永久局外中立之地位。此國家武力藏諸民間之世界趨勢也。（三）魏益三將軍之軍事準備方案，曾提及訓練民衆警備軍一萬萬八千萬人之辦法。其目的在使戰鬭區域之民衆，因警衛軍之組織，而有戰鬭能力，警戒能力，諜報能力，以及夜襲奇襲敵人之能力，同時，使非戰鬭區域之民衆，因警衛軍之組織而有勦匪勦共之能力。一旦地方駐軍開拔即能保衛地方。萬一前方戰鬭失利，敵人侵入，亦有奇襲敵人，收容軍隊之能力，此中國軍官之主張民間須儲備武力者也。</p>
<p>請更進言民間武力與國家自衛。中國目前自衛問題中最切實之目的，爲使侵我領土之敵人，受其應得之損失，不得不知難而退。同時，使虎視耽耽者，明</p>
<p>瞭武力侵略行動之未盡於彼有利，不致輕於一發。有人推測，日軍方面，倘早知有今日東北義勇軍四起抵抗之局勢者。必不致有去年九一八之輕舉，此種推測之是否確當，吾人雖未易斷言。然此東北義勇軍之中國民間武力，其效用所著，一方面使被侵佔之四百七十餘萬華方里中國領土中，存　中國人民與敵軍長期之鬭爭，使敵人窮於應付。苟能堅持多時，則有列强西伯利亞撤兵之前例，東北日軍之被迫退出，亦未始爲必不可能之事。另一方面，自義勇軍四起，日軍擴大侵佔範圍之企圖，已大受打擊。吾人觀於此未經訓練，未得國家協助之民間武力所著之成效，即可知苟使政府對於民間武力，作有計劃之儲備者，對於國家之自衛，必將表現其更大之功績也。</p>
<p>中國正式軍隊，非　具備現代作戰中種種必要之兵器及其設備與條件，不能與列强之軍隊，爲有把握之對抗。此觀於十八年滿洲里之役，梁忠甲韓光第之覆敗可以得，敎訓。更觀於今年一二八戰役中，十九路軍之苦戰犠牲，又得一敎訓。蓋來侵之敵軍，持新利之武器，於其飛機，重砲，坦克車，化學戰具等掩擊後，洶湧而來，目前之中國軍隊，定難與敵而獲勝，訿爲必然之事實，然在民間軍隊之游擊戰爭中，敵方種種新式武器，殊不易顯其十足之效用，此梁韓忠勇能戰之軍·所以一敗而不可收拾，而未經訓練之東北義勇軍，所以能與日軍作持久之對抗也。吾人知梁韓舊部重整以來，仍未能依現代作戰之需要，補充必要之兵器設備，知十九路軍於上海戰後仍缺其所缺之種種，因以明瞭中國正式軍隊改善之不易，而對於民間武力之適用於中國自衛，益增加其信念。　　吾人非不希望中國陸海空軍之改進與擴充，而如十九路軍者，使之完成可以爲現代作戰之軍隊，其事亦非甚難。然在相當長時間中所受之敎訓·則使吾人不得不以中國自衛之責任，委之於民間武力。故今日欲言中國自衛問題·其最急要者，爲一方切實援助東北義勇軍，使此已有之民間武力，不致爲敵人所摧毀；一方則充實民間武力之儲備，以應環境之需要。</p>
<h3>實施統制經濟　　武幹</h3>
<p>今年的雙十節·恰巧在國難重重的時候，實在引不起我們的慶欣。不過現在國還没有亡，國慶紀念還在可自由自在地去慶祝的時候，總是大家慶祝一下的好。古語所謂：「有花堪折終須折，莫待無花空折枝，」像現在這樣政治的混亂·軍閥·横行·把什麽國家大事弄在旁邊，只是爭權奪利。極力内閧，對外至於不敢遺一矢：我們恐怕以後眞有「無花折枝」的時候，那時候便要連慶祝也有所不能了。所以現時秉着「殷憂啓聖多難興邦」的意旨，還是説幾句慶祝自勵有話，來與國人共勉。</p>
<p>我覺得今後國要自救的話至少須要定下一個基相原則：便是「澈底改造政治，然後實施統制經濟。」我的本意全在後項；可是前項的大前提尤當注重。中國政象之壤。莫壤於今日：但是大家總是抱着聽天由命的心理而莫可如何。在國民革命運動初起的時候，「打倒帝國主義」和「打倒軍閥」曾經作爲政治革新的兩大目標；可是到了現在，帝國主義不獨没有打倒，牠反而佔據我們的半壁江山了至於各地軍閥勢力之盛，較之以前只有過無不及：但是現在誰還敢説「打倒」呢？軍閥没有打倒，政治便無澈底澄淸之日，更談不到有計劃的經濟建設。所以澈底改造政治，我認爲目前自救的唯一大前提：而政治改造的着手，便是消滅軍閥制度。消滅軍閥制度最要的條件，便是武人絶對不能干與民政，只要純粹担任　侮動匪的工作。這個最低的限度能夠作至，政治上便有了辦法，我們才好談到經濟建設。不然一切都是廢話。</p>
<p>講到目前中國經濟的建設，頭緒萬端；但是我們也要有一個根本的原則：便是「有計劃的　　經濟統制政策」</p>
<p>原來現代經濟的趨勢。大抵不出三條路向：第一便是自由經濟·這本是資本主義發展的大原則：便是到了現時：實在流弊狠多。「衆與寡」和「强併弱」的現象，我們在自由競爭的經濟塲中，可以隨時發見，年來「産業合理化的運動」，雖曾哄動了一時：許多國家也都想藉此爲自由經濟開一新局面：可是結果也徒只促進空前未有的世界經濟恐慌。我們又怎呢？能由自由競爭中打開條出路呢？并且以現時中國工商業落後的國家，要同其他資本主義國家自由競爭，却也只有天然處於劣敗的地位，這是我們所應當自省的。</p>
<p>其次，國營企業的提倡，近年來亦頗不乏其人。並且在事實上却也有許多國家實行種種國營企業了。例如鐵路航業電報電　礦山等項事業，世界各國差不多都是國家經營。國家完全立於私人企業的地位，來和一般商人爭利於商業角逐之場。這種經濟組織，本來没有什麽可以非議：所難的，國營事業的擴張，目下我國實還難以辦到。因爲假使化一般大企業爲國營，則「無償没收」與「作價收買」，便都要成爲很難解决的問題。個月前，廣州市政府强制收電力公司爲市有，曾經引起絶大的風潮，便是個例證。至於「作價收買」。在目前我國政府有財力，實萬萬談不到這層。譬如上海電力公司這樣的公用事業，實存不應該由國際資本去營假使要由「作價收買」收回國營的話，這一家的資本便是九千萬兩（？）要比民國十七年以前任何一年的全國海　税收多多了。　　再次國家計劃經濟，這也是公認爲較國營企業更進一步的現代經濟發展嶄新的趨勢；但是在目前的中國，却也没有實行的可能。不要説某部長的十年鐵路計劃各某長的五年實業計劃，久已成爲歷史上的名詞；便是現在眞要按照若干年的計劃，依次實行的話，却也有事實上的種種困難。原來，國家計畫經濟的特徵，須全國一切經濟組織都已有了很嚴密的聯絡關係：而發縱指示的最高經濟機關，更須具有絶大的統制能力。例如蘇聯的五年計畫和新五年計畫，便是遵着一定的方針按步實施的。而在我國怎樣呢？一條一條的鐵路，都是各自爲政，有許多不聽鐵道部的指揮；而鐵道部本身和交通部的行政，又好像道不同不相爲謀：而交通部以外，又有所謂「建設委員會」也已建設許多有關交通的事業就這樣一件小小例子，便也可看出目前實施國家計畫經濟的困難一班了。何况政制以外，又還有財上的困難，和各地的軍閥作梗！以及帝國主義的暗中破壞那麽整個系統的國家計畫經濟。目前却又怎樣能行得通呢？</p>
<p>自由經濟的流弊，旣然很大，無裨於經濟建設的前途；而國營企業的財力上，又有許多困難；國家計劃經濟，非在强有力之政制下面，更難實行得通：那末最後便只好講求列有效力而比較容易實施的「統制經濟」了。有人説到「統制經濟」實爲現在經濟組織發展的必然趨勢。自去年下年世界的金融恐慌追隨産業恐慌而擴張後，「統制經濟」差不多成爲現代各國的最重要的經濟政策，便可看出這個時代潮流正在一天一天的高漲。</p>
<p>這種統制經濟的内容，是由國家設立種種法令，統制一切經濟或某一方面經濟的活動·現在世界各國比較通行的統制經濟範圍，爲「匯兑統制」和「貿易統制」。匯兑統制的主指，在防現金的逃出國境：而貿易統制，則在限制不必要的輸入，以謀改善國際貸借，以便處於有利的地位：此外對於金融各信用事業，國營和私營企業農業和勞工事業，甚至大宗專門産業，如絲業與米榖業等，亦有主張加以統制的。年來統制經濟的效果，雖然不很大，可是許多國家，却都在極力提倡。原來這種經濟的國家主義，雖然在理論中確有可以非議的地方，如本年五月初旬柏林世界經濟會議，即以世界經濟的不振，歸咎於關税障壁，輸入限制，和貿易管理等項阻碍通商的行動：而最近國際聯盟會委員會的最後報告，所提出來的世界經濟恐慌補救方策，也以廢除國際通商限制，如關税與匯兑統制等爲要圖。這在自由貿易的理論方面説來，自是天經地義：但以現時國際經濟競爭的激烈，却有誰肯先犠牲本國的利益，來謀世界大同的福利呢？所以廢除通商限制的高調儘管高唱入雲，而實際上各國對於經濟上統制的計劃，却進行日烈。我們處在這個大時代的圈子里，怎能不設法有以自處呢　　就中國的現狀來説：不要説什麽經濟侵掠，但求經濟自立衛，便也有實施經濟統制的必要。原來，我國一切經濟活動都像是盤散沙。以致金融貿易大權全握在外人手中，聽他們的擺佈：而國内一切生産事業，也都因没有通盤籌算的計劃以致需給不能相應，不能爲系統的調節。所以整個的經濟統制計劃，眞是目前所急需的。我們新近看到一個很好的例證：便是去年中國銀行邀同紗廠棉商合組一中國棉業公司·在山東陜西河南三處　收買棉花，一年之中便買了四萬多包，有這樣一個小小的私家統制機關，對於貨物的需要分配方面，雙方便都已感覺莫大的便利：倘使由政府各商家更爲一種大規模的統制對於産銷方面利益豈不更大，否則内地有貨棄於地的危險，而通商口岸，却又不勝洋貨的壓迫，所以有計劃的生産統制和販賣統制简直是必要了。</p>
<p>我國現在的生産事業類此情形的很多：如絲茶大豆雖爲歷來出口大宗，而一向聽其受洋商的操縱：又如洋貨進口，頗多壓迫國貨工業發展，我國一向也莫可如何。可是現在我國關税旣已自主，又爲甚麽不圖補救呢？就「貿易統制」説，現在世界各國實施的已達二十幾國有好些國家都已收有成效。他們統制貿易的方法，種類很多，但是共同的原則，却在對於認爲不必要的輸入品，即限制甚或禁止其進口。這種方法，其他自主國家都可以行施的，我國也當然可以仿行。貿易統制，只是特爲重要的經濟統制的一種，我國其他一切經濟事業，也都無不可通盤計劃，立下統制的辦法，來打破現在這種散漫的組織。總之在現在國際競爭日益激烈的時代别國以有組織有計劃的經濟侵略方法來進攻，而我國却散漫無備那是終於不免受天然的淘汰的。何况現在國難方殷，日本帝國主義佔據東省以後，又已大規模地講求「日滿經濟統制的方策」以謀「滿蒙之國内市塲化」呢。我國武力抵抗的話姑且不用説吧，難道有計劃的經濟抵抗方法，也不能急起直追來講求嗎？</p>
<h3>東三省問題之將來</h3>
<p>我國之爲整個國家，絶不容任何勢力强爲分割，是爲天下所共知共見：且民族之齊一，文字語言之完美，生活格調之切近，三千年來雖共間不免偶有分離，然旋復歸一，是故可自命爲世界上統一完整之民族而無愧。遼，吉，黑，三省遠　東北，自唐代以還，即屬於中國版圖，滿淸入主華夏，典章制度，殆與漢族同化，混合爲一，淸庭懦弱無能，誠已達於極點，而民間進步，仍未因政府關係而過度停滯，不過較爲遲緩而已。民國成立後，政府雖未能眞正達於民治之域，而此種民治的　運動，日愈强烈，則爲極顯明之事實。縱令因國内連年内戰，演成政治上種種不安現象，中央地方常若各不相屬，而各民間向心的傾向，　望統一固誠　而　實也。近二十年來，雖外受强敵之侵蝕，内遭軍閥之摧殘，亦能於艱苦之中，努力自求其出路。至於東北之禍，固不自今日始，甲午戰敗，割地請和已種其遠因：日俄之戰，復不能乘機自救，歐戰千載一時之良機，亦令其輕輕過去；迄乎北伐成功統一告竣之際，對危於累卵之東北，亦未聞有何種遠大計劃。去年六月内田　哉以外交界耆宿被任爲滿鐵總裁，宇垣一成以長閥領袖而任朝鮮總督，即已顯露侵奪東三省之先機，當時即竊竊私議，恐東北將不免於發生禍變！不幸我國當局處此，過於泰然，臨事不懼以致日人唆使鮮民製造萬寳山案，釀成朝鮮境内虐殺華僑之舉，而我仍乏善後之　，隨敵方之意識爲轉移，其計之失未有甚於此者也！</p>
<p>及敵方偵騎四出，準備大舉，我仍慒慒如睡，僅以不理了之，是以「中村事件」一星之火，竟至於燎原也。至所謂中村（震太郎）大尉也者，無故深入博克圖内地，爲軍事密探，因此遭遇意外以致身死，在情在理，不僅我國不能擔負任何責任，且應提出嚴重抗議，并須竭力警戒勿使此種事變之再發。無如當時東北地方負責當局，遇事委曲求全。不意竟煽起日本軍閥之侵略狂熱，「中村太尉事件」即作爲侵占東北之唯一口實。而滿鐵爆破案，在日方宣傳，似眞若有其事者，其實乃爲其軍事發動之重烟幕，其主要目的固在於欺瞞其國民，引起日人之對華敵視，其次則在於爲外交方面留地步，與今年一·二八上海事變之陰謀同出一轍。　變起後我軍不戰而退，（滬變則有十九路軍與第五軍之三十一日抗戰，故上海得因一戰而勉强保全），節節失守且也，敵國之間，彼退則我進，我退則彼進，勢理之常自古所習見者；是故我愈退縮愈忍讓，敵則愈强硬愈猛進，瀋陽吉林旣不崇朝而拱手讓人，錦州一帶，更難有堅守之可能，故日人仍不費一槍一彈，即安全占領錦州：惟有黑山白水之間屯墾軍與馬占山所領一旅之衆，雖僻處邊埀，仍能保持我民族之光榮，與强隣作必死之爭鬥縱使鐵路沿線到處爲敵騎蹂躝，而一隅之地，尙保存我民族未來之生機。　　然而近代文明，一切建於經濟基礎之上，鐵路交通旣爲敵人所壟斷，我之行　當然受其牽制矣。於是乎狡獪之日本，運用其帝國主義的陰謀，一面用强力手腕把握經濟重心，一面以金錢收買自私自利只知有個人安樂，不知國家民族存亡之漢奸霄欣伯于冲漢張海鵬之流其鷹犬，又復利用滿洲滿族之名，拉致愛新覺羅溥儀出關，自所謂地方維持會，而醞釀「和製」民族獨立招牌，以欺騙東三省人民，欺瞞歐美諸國，欺瞞日本之純良民衆，以遂其軍閥侵略野心。及至今年三月一日乃造成傀儡組織，美其名曰滿洲（僞）國，三月八日日軍運其特别列車載一偶人前赴長春，錫以佳名曰執政，設官封職之外，并改元（　號），嚴若眞有其事矣。而吾儕細究其實際則何如？（一）彼所標榜之「王道主義」施設新政，所謂「根絶苛政及軍閥勢力」等均爲軍事侵略與經濟侵略（所謂開發産業）之面具，　爲運其亡韓故智，併兼東北三省之第一步。（二）所謂「東亞民族融和」</p>
<p>，不過「東亞門羅主義」之别，其殘暴旦有過之，試以滿洲僞政府組織而論，雖其執政以下各院部長，均係投順日人之石晋一流人物，其實際權力則盡操諸一般掛有二重國籍（日人）之手，此種「内日外滿」之怪官吏，總數約有六百人，輔之以日軍日警，於是乎滿洲（傀儡）者眞不失其爲徹底徹面之「和製」傀儡。（三）所謂「民衆意志」尤爲妙千古，雖日警苦心孤詣四出收買，而附從民衆仍　無幾，甚至以十萬日軍，竟不能維鐵道沿線之安寗秩序。其所謂「新局面」者如此而已。</p>
<p>傀儡組織旣如此其混沌，僞政府又如彼其無能，然則彼將何以自立，何能以二十萬之日人而竟侵略東北三省乎？曰是非無故也，蓋日人之謀奪取東三省已非一日，去年始完全暴露耳。其在南滿路沿線駐紥之關東軍獨立守備隊，其名雖只六個步兵大隊，一個砲兵大隊，其實戰鬭兵總數不下八千餘人。去年九一八事變之前，即暗調仙台第一師團及龍山（朝鮮）第二十師團夜車，潛行赴南滿路一帶駐紥，是故彼自造之北大營事件爆發後，奉天吉林一日之内即相斷瀹陷也。然而遼吉原野萬里，我愛國健兒又復不斷抗敵，使披四萬兵力，雖欲勉强維持主要城市之治安而亦感莫大困難，故在滬戰始之時，彼即欲以滬戰而轉移我國人眼光，由注視東北而注視上海。以便其侵吞，距知淞滬之戰，彼未得逞，東北之對日，反因此而增長其勇氣；於是日人乃更增加兵力。除將參加滬戰之宇都宫第十四師團全部移往東北之外，更抽調鹿島五師團，名古屋三帥團之特種部隊，（騎兵及砲兵）增加至東北前綫，但依舊效力微薄，不能拒退具有充分民族反抗精神之義勇軍。三個月之前，彼又借換防爲名，調出弘前第八師團，姬路第十師團開赴東北，八師團在南滿一帶及四洮路綫，第十師團則赴哈爾濱等處，且又抽調各師團（其番號現尚不明）之特種部隊（騎砲兵）以換回一部分之疲　步兵。據目前形勢觀之，日軍雖强，亦不易穩定其侵略所得之地盤。義勇軍之活動，如能更加組織化，强力化，則不難與日軍作長期鬭爭也。日本旣以　横手段强襲東北，侵佔多領土，魚肉我人民；在我國固不能再事忍耐，必起而與之抗爭。歐美各强國亦無不視我國爲最有希望之更　且爲救濟</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>現代世界經濟恐慌之唯一有效塲所，東北三省尤爲完　之處女地，一旦全被日人獨占，列國豈能就此甘心，任其侵吞乎，茲特分述世界主工諸國之對東北態度如次：</p>
<p>一·美國於東北關係似極淺薄，更缺乏不可分離之經濟關聯，其對華好意似甚眞確，亦比較純潔惟其比較純潔，故其對華好意乃更覺淸淡耳，蓋當今之世（國際間關係尤爲顯然）以利益之是否一致爲合分最大前題。北美合衆之金融資本已登峯造極，且大有領袖全世界之勢，乃經濟恐慌襲來之後先進之歐洲首當其衝，長期繁榮之美國受害尤烈，南美旣被殃及，門羅主義遂無施展之餘地，開拓（中國）市塲乃爲其必然之趨勢，不意陡逢日本用軍國主義預政策，不問列國關聯，不顧中日邦交，肆行侵占東北三省致美國未來最有希望之市塲無故而削去大半，安得而不憤怒！然而憤怒亦僅僨怒而已。美國於利害之計算素極精密，尤不肯輕躁冒險，現時經濟恐慌之餘燄未息，暴日狂熱之氣勢方張，彼將細密計較：一面爲海軍兵力之切實預備，一面　國際聯絡之攻守同盟，雖未必能如顧以償，但至少亦應求英美之諒解以至美蘇諒解，然後乃能對日。故此刻美國最多僅能以抗議爲極點。</p>
<p>二·英法兩國在歐洲本不相能，而對華則有幾許共通之點，對日至少不似美國之趨於尖端也。以英國而論，長江流域方面殊難與日本一致，而竟與日本妥協者，其内部原因各治領離心傾向過甚，勢逼使然也，兼之以蘇聯循序進步，由蘇俄本境之建設，而土西鐵道成功，中亞細亞工業化，勢將南出印度，西比利亞工業化，則是虎視北滿；在英國必欲保持印度之安全，在日本則將形成東北三省之獨占；同時英日二國又皆爲投資於中國（各有十二萬萬五千萬美金以上）之大投資國家，深不願中國民族資本之有蹶起，故仰華防俄皆爲彼等當前之急務。法蘭西初意不過欲維持西方覇權，加强其東方實力而與日本聯絡；最近德意接近，凡爾賽各約大難維持，彼爲其目前利益計，不能不積極扶殖國聯信譽。是以英法前日對東三省問題常採騎墻態度，任事實之變化，近則略有維持和平抑制日本之意向。不過此種意向，恐多屬於外交關係，而實質的作用亦甚渺小。</p>
<p>三·蘇聯之於東北三省，本與我國及日本成鼎足對立之勢，如有我國在，則日蘇之間雖對立激化，我介在其間，可以緩和不少，現在日本佔有東北三省，日蘇間衝突雖愈加露骨，愈行硬化，縱令蘇聯當局警戒危機之襲來，凡百事先防備，以煤油換取和平，俾便努力於第二五年計劃之建設：然而日本之貪心不已，東三省不足以飽其欲，赤油亦不能止其渴，日蘇兩國終不免於一戰也，不過時間上須待引火物耳。</p>
<p>（德意對華，地域相距過遠，關係極微，茲從略，）</p>
<p>我中國爲東北三省之主人，在理應有最高之措置權利，奈何實力缺乏，不龍（至少是現時不能）以武力收回東北三省，恢復舊　域；戰旣不可，勢必　和，去年　變初起時，我國當局果能忍辱負重，立即直接交涉，雖不免喪失南滿四鐵道及其他經濟利益，行政權尙可收回，一般苦况或可减少，努力自强，亦較便利。時至今日，「各製」僞國已行成立，日本之大陸政策勢不可止，深恐直接交涉亦無從着手，日方且以「旣成事實」相脅，直接交涉之結果，於徒然取辱之外，恐尙不免牽聯我華北權利。</p>
<p>「直接交涉」旣失於去年瀋變之後，迄今三省瀹殁華北震動，過去信頼國聯希望國聯能抑制日本，乃九月三十及十月二十四之兩次决議均等於白紙黑字之廢紙，十一月十日之决議派遣國聯調查團東來，自本年二月二十九上海砲聲震天之際到達日本，三月中旬抵滬，四月二十一日入東三省，六月初旬又復返回北平，從事於草擬報告書，費時六個月有奇，現時報告書旣已發表，我國所得者幾何，所謂公理之實現性又幾何？此皆不待　筮，徵諸往蹟已明若觀火矣。縱國聯背後之英法欲勉强維持報告書之實現，恐亦無法制限日本之軍事暴行也　　日本之蠻横不可遏，我國有理亦無從講起，而英法此時僅能玩弄外交上之詞鋒，作折衝之泛論，終任强暴之横行而已，然而世界大勢所趨，各國以全力開拓市塲之際，寗能讓日本獨占？暫時之間或僅止於口頭爭論，而砲火相併之準備愈見積極，日本海軍新預算竟占全支出四分之一有奇，如曰非急於戰備，其誰信之！是以首當其衝之北美合衆國，似亦萬難坐視，英國據海上王座已久，其能袖手旁觀乎？蘇聯虎視耽耽，終必突起，則是世界第二次大戰將以東三省爲火藥庫，其爆炸性較一九一四年一前之巴爾幹尤有過之。</p>
<p>我中國民族際此時會，其何以自處？今日之東三省其德法間之亞爾薩斯·洛連乎？今日之中國其戰之土耳其乎？要在我國民自爲之耳。困疲已極之農工，誠爲建國基礎，而求生無路，饑寒交迫，焉有「活力」　致力於民族复興之爭鬭；惰性已深之官僚軍閥，恐更無回生民族之術：今日能及時奮起内舒民困外抗强敵作民族爭鬭之前鋒者，似仍爲處困境之中層分子也。然而事勢危迫，國力衰徵，此種困難，决非短時間内以一鼓作氣可得而解除者也。必須以最大之决心，百折不撓之效力，黽勉從事，乃可求得民族出路：乃可恢復失地：且當前之敵又非無能者可比，此種激劇的民族爭鬭，其勝負固不在一時，然片刻之機先，亦不能輕易放過，方能作百年之爭鬭，雪民族之恥辱，完成其歷史的民族復興之使命。</p>
<p>東北三省在最近期間，國聯旣不能强制日本歸還，我國民亦未必能立即以武力收復，舍此而外其最後總淸算第一須視我國民繼續之努力何如，第二須視吾人是否具必死之爭鬭精神，然後乃能在世界第二次大戰期中，收得最後成果</p>

<p>紀念詞</p>
<h3>國慶與國難元（一）</h3>
<p>在内憂外患交相煎逼之今日重重苦難中。又已臨到民國二十一年度之國慶紀念。猶記去年今日。本報曾刋有「從今年雙十節説到明年雙十節」一文。揭舉一年計劃。並以「昨死今生。」鄭重勗勵國人。冀以打破國難。漸以推動我國家進入光明之途。現在一年已瞬息度過。然而檢視一年來我國政治經濟之現狀。與其民生窮蹙之情形。吾人不能不承認一年來「國難」不僅是原封未動。而且危機日益增多。國計民生。都瀕於千鈞一髮最嚴重之境地。今日吾人立於颯秋風中招展的國旂之下。瞻前顧後。第覺滿腔悲憤。滿眼酸辛。歲月悠悠。長夜漫漫。今年如此明年更不知何若即欲破涙爲笑。亦不可能。「難」而已耳。何「慶」之可言。</p>
<p>當然。「國難」之來並非偶然。更非由於「天禍吾華。」或是「昊天不弔。」就對外一方面言。外患之來。自有其國際政治經濟之背景。就對内一方而説。内亂之作。與社會經濟之日益破落民生之日益凋敝。亦自有眞確之原因。</p>
<p>自從一九二九年世界經濟恐慌第一個浪潮在美國湧現而後。直到現在不僅無絲毫之轉機。且日臻於深入與惡化。復由於經濟恐慌之激湯。政治慌隨之而展開資本主義國家爲挽救其没落之命運。不得不出其全力以爭奪原料場。爭奪市。塲爭奪投資地。爭奪殖民地。換言之。即重新分割世界。中國爲一生産落後之國家。爲未開發之富饒之區。爲一人口稠密之大市塲。亦即爲事實上已陷資本主義先進國經濟侵略之悲境之次殖民地。當然在動盪不安之國際政局下。在列强積極準備分割遠東市場的情勢下。中國之「外患」紛至。自爲勢所必然。</p>
<p>次之。自鴉片戰爭而後。資本主義先進國之經濟勢力。即直接伸入我農村。我農業經濟遂隨之而日瀕於潰與破落。復以帝國主義者之播弄。與殘餘封建勢力之作最後掙扎。使我國政治不能步上軌道。於是而戰亂時作。而捐税繁重。而災荒洊至。使農業經濟加速其崩潰。目前整個社會經濟與國家財政。都呈顯「破産」之狀態。民生日益窮蹙社會經濟陷於顚播不寗。蓋亦自有其致此之因。絶非偶然。</p>
<p>總之。在動盪之世界中。中國之不安爲勢所必然。假如吾人徒深致感喟悲憤於國難之日益加重。而不能把握此「必然」之趨勢。則吾人將永遠陷於迷惘與失望之中。亦即永遠不能「打破國難」。永遠不能奪取光明之前路。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>吾人今試一檢查一年來我國所遭受之「國難。」結算一年來之總賬。俾知一年來所受之打擊爲若何之嚴重。民族之危機究已臨至若何嚴重之程度。</p>
<p>吾人首先所應檢查者。當然爲「外患。」去年九一八日本强佔東北之發動。其動機不外有四。（一）日本企圖以對外問題緩各其國内革命。（二）日本企圖使東三省半殖民地爲其「獨占之殖民地。」以推進其大陸政策。（三）予美國之門户開放機會均等以迎頭打擊。換言之。即予美國對中國投資以阻力。使不至爲日本在東亞之勁敵。（四）取得在東方反蘇聯之領導權。當然。此一事實。是以動盪的國際政局爲其眞實之動力。並不是由於少數日本軍閥之「窮兵黷武。」或「侵略野心。」</p>
<p>然而九一八禍變之爆發。實爲我民族致命之一擊。以言土地。佔我全面積十二分之一之三百二六萬二千七百萬方里。不崇朝而變易其顔色。以言人口。佔全國人口百分之八之三千萬同胞。國未亡而身先淪於奴隸之悲境。以言資源。據前歲日本關東廳之滿洲産業統計。全東三省農産物綜計約一千九百萬噸。占我全國農産量百分之二十以上。近年東北農産物輸出額達二萬萬八千萬海關兩左右。占我全國内部輸出總値六萬萬六百海關兩之百分之四十八以上。其他已開發與未開發之鐵煤金等各種礦産。以及廣大之森林鐵道。都全爲日人所攫得。故東北之淪亡。吾人即暫置國防上之嚴重危機不言。而此種經濟上之損失。亦實爲我國家極其深重之創傷。據中央統計處之初步統計。九一八事變中官方之損失。總計一百七十八萬萬元强。而吉黑兩省報告不全。實尙不止此數此外近數年以來。我内部諸省人口稠密之區。每年移居關外者達二百餘萬人。自日人强佔東北後。樹立僞政權。竟視山海關内國人爲「外國人。」均享以閉門羹。此後在人口之移殖上。當亦遭受嚴重之打擊。以上爲東北禍變中我國所蒙受之損失。天津兩次變亂。我國復損失六百萬元。一二八滬戰爆發據官方初步統計。</p>
<p>我國損失又爲十六萬萬元。凡此打擊。直接爲置我民族於生死綫上。而間接亦即更予我社會基礎以絶大之震撼。然而我國處此種情勢之下。始則以未明九一八日本侵略之動機。堅持不抵抗主義繼乃信頼國聯。徒發文字上之抗議。不謀有效之對策。馴至僞國公然樹立。日本且正式予以承認。國聯調查團之報告。亦復稜其辭。日人視同廢紙。我國即欲倚爲讓符。而不可得。故一年來。東北問題之日即於繁難。外交情勢之日即於險。惡雖曰不安之國際經濟政治。實爲其根因。實有其「必然」之趨勢。但不能以自力謀自助自救。徒信頼他人。仰望他人。要亦不能不承認誤我國家者。實即爲吾人自身也。上言「外患。」茲請一言「内憂。」</p>
<p>今日而内憂。吾人眞爲之憂必仲仲。蓋我國今日外患固急。内憂尤急。而且無内憂决不至招來外患。更不至外患一來。即舉國惶亂。束手無以應付。環顧國内瘡痍滿目。政治不能步上正軌。經濟日瀕於破落。民生凋敝。危機四伏。此則眞爲國難。眞爲我國當前最嚴重迫切之大問題。</p>
<p>就政治言。在此外患日急之際。首有粤亂。繼有魯亂。近復有四川二劉之爭。是非不明。威信乃不立。紀綱乃不張。政治何若。吾人已從可槪見。</p>
<p>就經濟言。我國本爲以農立國。迄今尙未正式踏入工業經濟之了階段。而且我國今日於社會經濟與國家財政山窮水盡之際。猶能勉强支持者。仍以農村中尙可以剜肉醫瘡之故。自去年全國大水。直接之損失間接之影響。使農村經濟。已陷於全部破産之狀態。少壯流離。老弱輾轉。農田荒蕪。農産激減。吾人但就去年一年之輸入崦觀。其進口總値。其爲十三萬萬九百餘萬海關兩。（以下簡稱兩）入超五萬萬四千餘萬兩。其中棉貨爲一萬四千九百餘萬兩。棉花爲一百三千二百餘萬兩。米爲一萬二千一百餘萬兩。糖爲八千六百餘萬兩。烟葉及紙烟爲五千六百餘萬兩。麵粉爲三千一百餘萬兩。海味爲二千五百餘萬兩。毛織品爲二千四百餘萬兩。菓品藥材等爲二千三百餘萬兩。木材爲二千三百餘萬兩。人造絲爲一千四百餘萬兩。小麥爲一千二百餘萬兩。罐頭食品爲一千二百餘萬兩。此鉅大之輸入。都爲日常生活所必需。而且大都爲農産品。就此即可以反證我農産品之激減。與農村經濟之破落。即以本年上半年而言。進口貨爲六萬萬一百餘萬兩。入超爲三萬萬八百餘萬兩。下半年輸入更旺。較之去年入超之數字。當更驚人。民元以來。無年不入超。截至二十年止。入超已達三十九萬萬一千二百餘萬海關兩。合現在市價國幣六十萬萬元以上。夫以農立國之國家。而人民日常生活必需之衣食。都仰給於輸入。吾人即不言農業經濟破産。立國基礎崩潰可危。假如太平洋上一但發生戰事。我海港都被封鎖。輸入斷絶。吾人將何以自存耶。</p>
<p>今年湘鄂皖蘇浙各省秋收豐稔。然而仍無以挽救農村之危機。無以拯農民於水火。某原因有二。一爲去年水災而後。農民多借貸地主之儲穀。以維持其生活。今年春耕。牛頭種子。亦多來自高利貸。迨秋收旣登地主遂從而操縱穀米價格。湖南每擔穀價僅値二元四角米價亦跌至六元左右。皖省新米售價僅二元二角。江浙亦然。故農民種田一畝。即須蝕本數元。年雖豐登。而其生活絶未改善其次由於戰亂之驅逐。農村資本。大都逃來都市。尤集中於上海。結果都市深感過剩。而農村經濟則愈以周轉不靈。銀價增高。農産價値愈跌。今日將勢。穀賤旣已傷農。倘若如最近所傳。向美借貸價値五千萬元過剩之麥一説而信。則將來穀米價格。受其影響。自然更加跌落。農村經濟即更難以改善。</p>
<p>再就蠶桑言。今年五六月間。桑價最貴時。每擔亦僅售洋一元。較之往歲十元兩擔或十元三擔。價格已跌落四五倍之下。十九年無錫桑田共有二十五萬一千餘畝。二十年即減至十五萬餘畝。至今年更激減至八萬四千餘畝。桑産如此。絲業自不必問往年無錫五百餘繭行。今年開行收繭者僅十五家。即此一事。絲業之凋落。亦已可槪見。江蘇如此。浙江以至其他産絲區域。當亦小異大同。</p>
<p>農業之恐慌旣如上述。而工業之衰落。則尤爲嚴重。滬戰後。雖極少數之工業。因抵制日貨之故。較有起色。但滬變以後。上海之勞資爭議。層見疊出。幾於無日無之。就此即可以推知近來我國工業之凋敝之一斑。</p>
<p>農業恐慌之情勢旣如彼。工業凋敝之情勢復如此。然而人民之負擔。則日益繁重。即以我國内債之發行而言。可分爲兩個時期。北洋軍閥統治時代。自民元至民十五爲第一期。發行總額共爲六萬萬三千九百十萬六千五百八十元。國民政府時代爲第二期。自民十六至去年五年間。發行總額八萬萬九千九百萬元。此鉅大之債額。直接募自銀行。而間接則來自民衆。其影響社會經濟。當亦非細。尤有甚者。農村經濟日益破落。而各地方政府之苛捐雜税。則日益繁多。如四川之田頌堯部。在其割據區内。徵糧已達民三十四年。鄧錫侯部亦徵至民三十四年。劉文輝至民二十六年。劉湘徵至民二十二年。主郭油楝徵至民二十五年。劉存厚徵至民三十五年。他如福建之陳國輝。徵收苛捐至四十三種。新屋有捐。道釋有捐。鷄鴨蛋有捐。甚至棺材有捐。嫁娶有捐。巧立名目。敲骨吸髓。又如湖南田賦。民初每兩規定納洋三元六角。現以陸績增加附捐。每兩亦已增至十六元有餘。劉珍年在膠東「搜刮民財。加捐加税。百出不窮每丁銀一兩。加徵九元。一年徵至四次。軍需特捐又每兩加徵至三十四元。該師在防區内。徵派給養情形。二十年份在各縣有案可稽者。計共五百二十萬六千九百餘元。此外則又出其綁票手段。如黄縣張姓綁去大洋二百五十萬元。掖縣張姓林姓綁去大洋二百萬元。」（見五日魯韓電蔣張等電）以上所述。猶不過聊舉一例但由此一例。即可以推及全國。亦即可以覘知人民負擔之重。痛苦之深。與夫社會經濟破落之益以加速。</p>
<p>政府所取諸人民者如此其鉅。人民所負擔者如此其重。然而竭澤而漁。非爲建設。非爲生産。而爲供給軍隊之餉糈。據日内瓦軍縮會本年統計。英國軍額爲十一萬。美爲十五萬。法爲四十二萬。意爲五十一萬。日爲二十七萬六千。而我國所養这兵。則達百八十萬。其他雜牌軍隊與民團警察尙不在内。合上列五國綜計。尙較我國少三十一萬。國帑百分之八十以上皆用之於養兵。二十年十一月份以前。中央直轄各軍月支軍費二千五百五十萬元。養兵愈多。而戰亂亦愈以連綿不絶。荼毒人民愈深。社會經濟所受之打擊亦愈鉅。</p>
<p>就上述種種之現象觀察。則一年來我國之「國難。」實已愈臻於嚴重。國計民生都已不絶如縷。吾人處於今日。撫今瞻前。正悲哀之不暇。更復有何慶之可言。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>雖然。國難至此。悲又奚益。抑且在此一年中。要亦不無差强人意之現象。即如東北人民之紛紛自動奮起。爲收回失地。爲爭取我民族之人格。與日軍作長期之苦鬥。以視在甲午日俄兩次戰役後。東北同胞受日俄之蹂躪。並無反抗。就可徵此次義勇軍之興起。即爲我民族覺醒之實證。而其自動奮起。以自力解除自身之苦痛。不依頼他人。不希望他人。認識其自己之力量。其所顯示之意義則尤爲偉大。</p>
<p>吾人認爲徒悲哀不足以打破國難。徒呼籲不足以挽救危亡今欲打破國難必發揮我全民族之偉力。因矣。然吾人於「力」之發揮。亦必具有正確之認識。即少數人之「力。」决不及多數人之「力。」散漫之「力。」不及有組織之「力。」空談之「力。」不及行動之力。被動之「力。」不及自動之「力。」安樂之「力。」不及大難臨頭之「力。」無目的行動之「力。」不及認淸目標而行動之「力。」能把握「力」之眞實意義及其價値。更從而追求如何發動此偉力之道。則吾人稪何有於當前之國難。</p>
<p>語云。「無敵國外患者國恒亡。」今日之重重國難。謂爲我民族二十年來因循苟安之總結算也可。謂爲我民族生存能力之試騐亦可。謂爲助民族維新之動力亦無不可。光明在前。吾人但當努力。明年今日。吾人應共期在艱難奮鬥之中。相與狂歡歌舞我民族新生於　　　　之一。</p>

<p>▲路透九日倫敦電據星期泰晤士報稱、數星期前日政府曾向法國提議正式聯盟、法外部對於此議、加以愼重之考量與研究、法國某老外交家具有遠東事件之甚大認識與經騐者、切實發揮其接受此種提議乃不榮譽事之意見後、法國遂抛棄接受之思想、蓋以當李頓委員團正在調查遠東事件之際、締結此種盟約、乃對於有關係的他國破壤信義之舉動也、</p>

<p>兩國間中之一國、如受第三國攻擊時、他一國應嚴守中立、（三）在滿洲日俄發生衝突時、法國不能以日法協約之故、出而干涉、仍須嚴守中立、保障俄國、</p>

<h3>孫科仍主提前完成訓政</h3>
<p>孫哲生先生、昨日送來「國難中的國慶紀念之希望」一文、茲錄如下、</p>
<p>有幾家報館、要我在雙十節那天説幾句話、現在國難還在極嚴重的期間、所以我仍然想對這個問題、貢獻一點意見、我們當前的國難、不是一個單純有外交問題、是一個與内政有密切關係的一個問題、怎麽講呢、因爲日本强佔我們東三省、固然純焠是日本違背國際公法不顧國際正義的一種暴行、但是當時我國之所以不積極抵抗、以及現在還不能斷然採取積極收復失地的動作、却實在是由於我們内政方面有種種因難、如實力足不足以抗日的考慮、匪共擾亂的後顧之憂、政治領袖的主持不能一致等等、都不容諱言、是我們内政上的困難、也顯而易見、是東三省問題、至今仍無辦法解决的重要原因、由此、可知要解决東三省問題、單從外交着想、是不夠的、一定要把我們内政方面的種種困難、先行打破、然後才能在外交方面尋到一條生路、自從國聯調查團報告書發表後、去年「九一八」事件的是非曲直和僞國成立的内幕、已大白於天下自後國際輿論的同情無疑地是歸向我們、而且如果日前報載、關於法國改變袒日態度、對遠東問題、已與英美的意見漸趨一致的傳説、是可靠的話、今後我們在外交方面的困難、也一定可以减少許多、然而我們若放大眼光來看一看整個國際關係有趨勢、就可以明白這一閃一爍的光、原不過是滿天烏雲中偶然的點綴而已、現在的國際關係、已十分明顯、而急速地趨於惡化、上次歐戰的可怕的狀况和結果似乎已隨時光遠逝、不復能激動人們「非戰」的熱情、過去十年中最流行的幾個外交口號、如「公開外交」、「維持世界和平」、「伸張國際正義」、等等、已漸被人看作是　獃子的夢想、世界各國早就在整軍經武準備下一次的大屠殺、所謂國際聯盟軍縮縮議、已差不多變成外交家交際應酬和賣弄口才的俱樂部了、總而言之、今後的國際關係、已完全回復到戰前的舊路、各國都只顧各自爲謀、故不惜挑撥離間、縱橫捭闔、以達到損人利已的目的、在這樣的國際關係當中、只有實力才是最後勝負的决定者、我們若不急起直追、準備着全國的實力、做外交的後盾、而欲求正義的伸張領土主權的挽回、那豈不是在做夢、我於抵滬之初、對各報記者談話、屢於説明我國今後的外交形勢、或較前稍好以後、即再三致意於我們必須樹立獨立的外交政策、不應專依靠他人、就是根據這個理論、單靠外交的運用、即使運用成功、也不能滿意的解决、東三省問題、已是不容否認的事實、必需集中全國人民的力量、然後才能解救當前的國難、也已爲全國人人所公認的道理、問題是在如何可以達到這個目的、我在本年春季發表的抗日救國綱領中、曾有縮短訓政時期從速實行開始憲政的提議、雖然有人或以爲這是不合於建國大綱的規定、或以爲中國大多數人民、現在仍無實行民治的能力、而加以反對、但是我至今仍相信這是　該實施的辦法平反對者實在未能平心靜氣地看一看本黨的現狀是怎麽樣、反對者實在未能平心靜氣地想一想、本身已不甚健全、而需要根本改造的本黨、還有没有完成訓政的可能、我雖明知等到訓政完成、大多數人民、都已受過四權行使的訓練以後、再來實行憲政、是最妥善的辦法、然而我不能抺殺客觀的事實、而承認像現在這樣不健全有本黨、還能在兩年之内、完成訓政、（訓政綱領、規定民國二十三年、爲訓政終了期、）所以我主張不如在這個國難當頭的嚴重時期中、提前給人民以參政權、如此、一方面已可以集中全國的力量、來共赴國難、一方面又可以因其他政黨的爭長、而鼓勵本黨同志努力於本黨之復興、至於怕因人民程度不夠實行民治而發生弊端、我也以爲値得注意、但是我們正當的辦法、是要盡力設法補救、不是因此就要根本反對實行憲政、我相信這個主張、若得誠意實行、中國的内政外交、容或有展開一個新局面的可能、所以我在今天、中華民國的開國紀念日、重新向國民提起、希望全國人民共同努力、以促其實現、</p>

<h3>奪得却令治盃東華再勝西捕</h3>
<p>▲五與零比西捕片甲不歸</p>
<p>▲萬五千人看得手舞足蹈</p>
<p>東華捕昨在中華棒球場作第二次却令治賽、上半時依舊各無年獲、下半時一刻鐘後、西捕右前衛惠斯伍自己攻進一球、竟開東華勝球紀錄之端、全場爲之轟然、就此東華聲勢大盛、先後攻入三球、往後西捕右内衛　德亦攻入本隊一球先後媲美、誠趣事也、結果東華遂以五比零大勝、使萬餘觀衆、個個雀躍三百、從此却令洽盃、乃爲東華所有、</p>
<p>▲論表演興趣頗少昨日兩隊表演精彩頗少、故興趣淡然、局勢旣覺鬆懈、動作亦頗遲緩、以形勢而論、東華實盛於西捕、攻門機會極多、可惜瞄中者少、或被救出、故上半時毫無建樹、西捕方面、攻守均不見佳、守衛尤見疏忽、破錠甚多、時有巢卵之患、前鋒固極曉勇、惟東華李　馮運佑如兩座鐵閘、無懈可擊、加以周賢言之守門、安如泰山、餘子亦奮勇抵抗、不遺餘力、故不爲西捕動搖、</p>
<p>▲東華聯絡有功夫東華各　人之表演、旣其出色、而聯絡方面、亦殊有功夫、觀乎上次東華之勝、亦籟短傳　之巧妙耳、而昨日之連勝、亦因其合作之得法、前後呵成一氣、陣容殊爲鞏固、使西捕徒勞奔　、無從捉摸、所中三球、俱甚淸晰、西捕方面、聯絡尙有可觀、惟個别之表演較遜耳、彼自己打進兩球、足證其　頭之無標的矣、</p>
<p>▲西捕受逼十分鐘二時三刻、東華依紅色　衣出塲、稍作試　、西捕亦戎裝而出、由某外國影片公司拍攝有聲電影後、卽由何春　下令動員、西捕門球、進不　武、東華卽還殺西捕、左衝右突、精神振作、陳虞添先試脚頭、對門射擊、被守門救出、家球家球　　亦先後發射、西捕門前、四面楚歌、密佈東華健兒蹤跡、但無中的、一次萬象華傳球門前、守門拍球失手、球落門下、狀殊危險、亦東華絶好機會、但無人衝上、球乃被救十分鐘内西捕詳有進攻機會、</p>
<p>▲繼續壓迫又無功西捕一度進攻、</p>
<p>透納屢次深入、卒難得機攻門、故東華始終佔據上風、西捕區内、險球不脱、陳洪光帶球衝進、打破三關、長驅直入、將達站前、因發球過遠、爲守門上前還出、虞添角球送出、李義臣頭頂殊佳、不料竟落守門手中、又未得利、後西捕活根生單槍匹馬、帶球衝進、比及門前、正擬攻門、李寗將其撞開、化險爲夷、上半時終了、雙方各無建樹、　　▲東華不勞獲一球檸檬時間過後、東華得開球之便、直搗西捕要塞、但無機會可圖、西捕反殺過來、東華内部、不若上半時之安逸、今則四面受敵、防不勝离透納射門、由周賢言救出、喔克萊送出美妙角球、門下肉搏、東華幾遭意外、軋許復用遠射、球勢甚急、又爲周擋住、送出前方、萬象華逼得角球、由家球代踢、送出甚佳、義臣衝上頭頂、動作甚快、球由横木彈回、洪光再射無效、此時西捕門前、形勢殊爲緊急、李義臣亦得球攻門、球掠門向右、西捕右前衛惠斯伍擬鈎球向外、不料脚頭未凖、球竟猛射網窩、四座嘩然、東華竟勝一球、喜出望外、</p>
<p>▲十分鐘連加三球從此東華精神大振、縱横馳突、不可一世、家球代萬象華送出角球、正門之右角落下、雙方肉捕、虞添突放冷箭、在人叢中攻入一球、不三分鐘李義臣又攻門、球爲守門擋出、萬象華還送門前、陳虞添撥中、陳洪光力射、又入門内、動作極爲敏捷淸晰、往後因萬象華之傳中陳洪光又頂入一球、總計十分鐘内、東華連獲三球、聲勢雄壯、盛極一時、</p>
<p>▲蕭德反戈又破門西捕至此、軍容散漫、攻守均形荒亂、李義臣帶球前進、爲西捕内衛肅德所阻、而蕭德意欲傳球與守門踼出、時守門已跑出、不料蕭德用力過猛、球竟挑高守門</p>
<p>之頂、向門内穿入、先後由自己攻入一球、誠千古奇聞、殊堪發噱、此後西捕一度反攻、喔克萊與　克各打門一次均無效、李義臣乘西捕守門跑出時、對空門發射、	竟未中的、九十分鐘完畢、東華共勝五球、而以湯　餉於西捕、雙方陣缐如下按列、</p>

<h3>中華預選第二日陳陵破高欄全國紀錄</h3>

<p>▲冷培根爲擲重冠軍冷培根爲有名之擲重選手、昨於十六磅鉛球中、　倒陳戤牛（　球）、以十一米五九獲冠軍、鐵餅爲二五米九一、亦冷君第一、此兩項成績、爲田賽中最稱特色者、</p>

<h3>最後二分鐘優游和上海隊</h3>
<p>丨三比三甲組賽丨</p>
<p>▲上海隊先中三球</p>
<p>▲優游亦還奉三隻</p>
<p>優游足球隊、昨日在極惡劣形勢之下、連失三球於上海西人隊、後接連奪回三球、打成平局、不勝難能可貴之至、是爲西人會甲組賽之一幕、下午三時舉行於中華足球場、茲錄二隊陣容於左、　　▲優游隊陣線</p>
<p>朱生發</p>
<p>陸士芳奚巧生</p>
<p>梁官　　錢耀彬　　　　胡有成</p>
<p>朱璆　董小培</p>
<p>饒惠生　石金生沈柏貴</p>
<p>▲上海隊陣線</p>
<p>莫爾</p>
<p>史篤克希特爾　金勃</p>
<p>卡納爾　　　　薛弗　辛克萊</p>
<p>法　平　推洛　墨萊</p>
<p>白克斯德</p>
<p>▲惡劣形勢控制優游</p>
<p>中華足球場場地旣小、上海隊利用其有力这遠球、二三轉輾、卽達優游門前、上半時之優游乃侷處於此惡劣形勢、大半之球、盤旋於優游陣地、受盡壓迫、三十分鐘之中、一連爲上海隊打中三次、金勃二球、辛克萊一隻、幸後力破難關、胡有成亦還中二次、上半時三比二、下半時混戰無所成敗、最後二分鐘、頼朱生發之一球、遂成和局、</p>
<h3>全隊工夫尙欠合作</h3>
<p>上海隊皆爲多年老將、埠際名將甚多、優游初人甲組、得此成績、不勝可貴、全隊翹然出衆、自當推老將饒惠生、雖老而威風如昔擋住去路、不啻大柱一枝、梁門尙可、中術線左右二　稍差連連爲敵人漏入、空隙旣多、敵進乃易、前鋒於是陷於斷續、五鋒之中、兩翼露弱、不能管束出球、指揮如意、中央三鋒尙能活動、總之合作工夫、宜加練習也、上海隊上半時有精彩下半時陷於疲態、無甚特出辛克萊尙可觀、</p>
<h3>三十分鐘失守三次</h3>
<p>上海隊先行開戰、雖卽進取、優游亦截獲還攻、惟轉瞬上海隊左右齊進、其勢仍危、險象不脱、惡運卽見、金勃帶球直進、石金生阻之而失、中衛卽破、直衝而來、爲之蹴入、其時僅五分鐘優游仍居危境、失守後之二分鐘西人又臨饒惠生蹴之出白克斯德陽此角球、不偏入倚、辛克萊輕向左傅、金勃又中第二球、優游零比二矣、間或一次反攻、終於無效、辛克萊又帶球近門、梁官　在柱旁欲救、球已彈入、此三十分鐘優游連告三次失守、然並未灰心、</p>
<h3>不甘屈伏中鋒中連</h3>
<p>此爲上海西人隊之所以未曾成功、一味進取、不顧後防、而在此二三十分鐘經騐之中、以爲優游前鋒、不過如此、西優游之機會來矣、董小培胡有成並馬而上、上　門前、僅史篤克孤軍獨守董避過史、一傳與胡、提脚急射、中入網去、上半時尙有十分鐘、優游再施攻擊、朱生發沿左邊進襲、法平來阻、朱傅中央、胡有成射之又入不二分鐘上半時終局、三與二之比、</p>
<h3>最後二分鐘成和局</h3>
<p>優游以零比三而成二比三頓生希望、下局開始、一攻卽至敵門、沈柏貴勾一球、門前空虚竟射之不入、大爲可惜、混戰不分勝負、徒見爾來我往、四十分鐘之中、爲優游可惜者不少、一連可中不中之球、當在十次以上、幸未令人失望、最後二分鐘、朱生發在左翼急射一脚、有力而可觀、飛入網去、三比三和局而畢、</p>
<h3>約翰援助義軍籃球賽</h3>
<p>▲醫學院勝文理學院</p>
<p>▲結果五十三比五十</p>
<p>約翰大學醫學院學生前所發起之援東北義勇軍之籃球賽、已賽二次、昨日爲（十月六日）該項比賽之末幕、與賽者爲約大醫學院與文理學院、文理學院擁有去年名震上海之約大籃球隊之基本隊員如陳祥龍、吳幼林、陳驚醒等、全隊合作極佳、醫學院皆係久戰老將、如刁有過、侯學敏凌惠揚、曹福康曹裕平等、旗逢敵手’競爭自烈開賽後兩隊分數互有上下、上半時將終時、文理學院分數特然增進、上半時終丁、文理學院以二十一與十五之比勝、醫學院因上半時失分太多、努力反攻瞬時二軍分數卽行並等、下半時告終時、仍各獲四十一分延長五分鐘再戰、各又獲二分、並等終局、再延長五分鐘、醫學院卒以五十三與五十勝、聞當事人曹裕平君謂此次援東北軍賽、所有收入、總計有二百餘元、此欵幾盡得之於約翰大中學及約翰靑年會中學學生、詳細賬目不日公佈、曹君又謂此項收入、盡數匯東北、一切開支、並無絲毫取給于此、並謂收入雖然不豐、然深望海内體育家、聞風與起、將來成績、定爲可觀云、</p>

<p>商業新聞</p>
<h3>金融洋漲愈演愈烈</h3>
<p>昨晨市塲中、洋厘漲風、波濤洶湧、一星期中厘價差落甚巨、而最近愈演愈烈、前日稍覺平穩昨又漲風特殊早市爲七錢零八厘半、午市續高一厘爲七錢零九厘半結果較前日午市共計加漲三厘一二五客路去胃方興、宜其洋漲風不可遏止做出匯劃票欵早市六十三萬五千、午市二十二萬五千、鈔票祇午市四萬客帮裝去現洋仍有八十餘萬銀拆早市四分、午市二人分、錢莊銀公單收解二千三百餘萬洋公單收解四百七十餘萬、小錢莊交易五十餘萬、江南小洋早市爲六錢零八厘半、午市爲六錢一分、較前日改昂一厘半、交易早市四千角、午市六千角、廣東小洋早市爲六錢零一厘半、午市爲六錢零三厘、匪特超出六錢大關甚且高而遠之、相距三厘故兑換掛牌乃亦有參差矣、做出交易早市八萬五千角、午市七萬角、銅元回長五百文、爲四百二十三千五百文、</p>
<h3>最近厘漲的幾個主因</h3>
<p>滬埠現洋充斥、自四五月以來、無日不閙過剩、夏秋之初、商業凋零、農産物尙未豋場、更以春夏　汛歉收對於洋用、雖略有銷路、然遠不逮往年之甚故今年厘價之慘落、自有歷史以來所創聞、此番各埠銷胃達暢、殆亦有數種原因、試述如下（一）北路方面天津·奉天·靑島·烟台·等處、自九一八後市面本受戰事影響、無聲無　近因秋收雜糧次第豋場、需欵自繁、（二）南路方面汕頭·厦門·兩粤等處當去年底初時、因償還滬往來欵、紛紛運洋來滬、抵充帳欵、致該埠現底、本已枯竭、今已市面略有升色、金融籌碼、調劑不敷竟將厘價高抬、超出申厘遠甚（據説有一分多利益）於是紛紛電滬購裝（三）漢口及長江方面、向來現欵、來多去少、現因京杭兩幣廠停鑄已久市上需要爲雜糧用途而增多、故亦須向滬購運、且湘川方面用途、亦仰漢濟、而漢勢必向滬取用也、（四）内地方面、通·崇·海·及甬·姚等各地、棉花豋場、用洋每年如此、必有大宗接濟、故連日亦凑閙熱爭相購裝、（五）本街方面、銀行除準備金不能流動外、其他餘額欵項買賣、自是踴躍故近日厘價之漲、形勢之旺雖屬當然之事實、殆亦各處適逢其念耳、</p>
<h3>上週金市閑散帶軟象</h3>
<p>上週間標金、由鋒復萎、連漲五週後之反動也、惟市況初有劇變嗣後風平浪靜、逐日差度僅計三四兩、而各方買賣猶亦閑散、自週初開盤、即漲四兩三錢、爲七百三十六兩三錢、繼則漲爲三十七兩、蓋以銀市報縮、頃悉大連匯票慘落、乃大連帮傾向賣予、日商銀行、故該行等遂卽售出美滙、致價頓呈鬆濫、至場内突起狂瀾、大户蜂湧脱售、聞中央銀行隨之賣出、且謠傳北平某要人中毒之説、人心益疲、暴跌十兩以上、大有江河日下之槪、幸中央吸收現金甚力、致價得以拉住、惟至翌晨最小價猝跌至七百二十三兩五錢、然後買方活動、復轉上乘、復以海外銀市異趨、致滬市匯票稍亦複雜、而金價盤旋於七百三十兩内外、最後似濳萎挫、多空兩方均無多量、並以雙十節國慶紀念、銀行封關、金交連星期日亦須休假兩天、以此咸抱穩健、不敢多做、以防開市後有變動之虞、迨結果爲七百二十八兩一錢、比較前週六回落三兩九錢、而開收盤相去計跌八兩二錢、至於現貨所開出之價、初爲七百二十七兩左右、後三十一兩七錢五、厥後二七十兩、中央約共吸收二千餘條、惟赤條平平、照標金</p>
<p>計加十兩光景、至於國際銀市統核尙平’本埠英金掛長半檔、（一二五）美金二五、而内部先令長一二五、美金長一八七五、華商金業中求塞紛岐、中央銀行賣出頭寸、大半套進現金、各金號亦有套頭交易、而結價初撳七十餘兩、復計七十兩内、至大連帮仍占多方、惟廣帮恒興空頭未動、金交條額最近二萬四千以上、國外滙兑頻小不已、英對美跌二五、美對英降去五六二五云、今將英美銀價及匯票標金高低價、列表於後、</p>

<p>上週本埠華商證券交易所各債市况、現貨交易仍淸、全週祇八萬零二百元、期市亦不及前、市塲人氣沉靜、十一月期已開拍多日、然除鹽税於週一稍有交易外、其他於全週中槪無市面、故在上週内實際僅十月期一種交易、查每日成交情形、以週初一日爲較旺、計佔四百九十萬元、餘日多在二三百萬元左右、週末一日最淸、僅一百四十餘萬元、統計全週成交總數一千五百九十萬零五千元、較前星期減一百七十七萬元、時局及外交形勢、非常平靜、市塲人心觀望、求供始終均衡、結果以較前週、現貨以除上期本息計算、一致稍漲、期貨惟整六漲達九角半、其他稍疲、惟爲數祇二三角、債市形勢、由目下環象言之恐一時難望發展云、茲將一週來各債券價高低漲落情形列後（單位元）</p>

<p>二一枝譚</p>
<h3>雙十與葫蘆</h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>唯一無二的悶葫蘆是什麽？</p>
<p>便是國聯調查團負着重大使命經着悠久時間往來僕僕在海陸空三界的過程中製造的一部巨帙報告发書。好了，這個特别悶蘆，已在雙十節前揭去了葫蘆的蓋。</p>
<p>説到這裏，我又得佩服古人製字的巧妙了；葫蘆二字的覆蓋部分，本來都是雙十，似乎數有前定，這個悶葫蘆不到雙十節前便不是揭去蓋兒的日期。</p>
<p>葫蘆揭去了蓋兒，是胡盧了：但是，不妙，胡盧二字的解釋，依舊和葫蘆差不多，可以寫作葫蘆的，也可以寫作胡盧；所差異的，有雙十符號者呌做葫蘆，没有雙十符號者呌做胡盧罷了。</p>
<p>一部巨帙報告書，確乎在雙十節前披露了！但是報告書的内容，果然合於是非之公麽？報告的建議，果然可以見諸事　麽？唉·夜長夢多，這又在不可知之數了·悶葫蘆打破了蓋兒，依舊是個悶胡盧：内容是差不多的，所差異的，未經披露的報告書，呌做悶葫蘆；已經披露的報告書，呌做悶胡盧罷了。</p>
<p>報告書已到了披露的時期，但是，國聯諸公已應允着暴日的要求，在最近數星期内，對於報告書的研究，暫守緘默，嘴巴上彷彿貼着十字封皮似；阿呀！完了·悶葫蘆的雙十符號，又移轉到他們的嘴巴上去了！</p>
<p>神秘的雙十！不可思議的葫蘆！</p>
<h3>國難下的國慶</h3>
<p>— 呂夢焦</p>
<p>啊！一年容易又是國慶日了，我們説他「國慶」，毌寗説他是「國悼」，或是「國哀」還比較來得切實一點，我們不須再睡在井底，應該「更上一層樓」來看看了：東海上排列着一隊一隊的惡魔，正在開始它們的野心，不住的向我們威嚇，向我們進攻！</p>
<p>木屐兒的鬼技，眞是層出不窮，像請出傀儡，組織僞國，實行移民，慢慢的更進一步，派駐大使，攫取關税，而至於開發富源了；它們作事的程序，和果敢的精神，實在令人驚心動魄啊！</p>
<p>「無敵國外患者，國恒亡，」我們三四十年來，幾無日不處在敵國外患之下，可是强了没有？非但國家没有强起來，就是連原有的祖上遺産！土地！都怕要保不住，本來敵國外患，是何等利害的嗎啡針啊！或許是嗎啡針打得太多，而反使皮膚麻木了，像最近山東的火併，和正預備刀兵相接的四川問題，竟忍心在這皇皇不可終日的當兒演了出來：際此寇患日深，而自己内部仍舊是這樣的四分五裂，偶然讀了「賸有虚名國未亡」之句，一禁黯然淚下</p>
<p>四面打起了一聲聲國難之鐘，和着一片戰鬥的砲火，籠罩了今年！民國一十一年的國慶日，</p>
<h3>國旗的怨苦</h3>
<p>— 蒂</p>
<p>小子，爲什麽總把我懸蕩在半空中呢？一二八，半旗；五三，半旗；五九，半旗；九一八，半旗。夠了夠了。平空地給我矮了半截身子，抬頭而望，美國旗，英國旗，法國旗，都高高地飄揚着，而尤其氣不過的，是那矮子的旗，也高高地爬在我的頭上，威風都給它們壓倒了。小子，你們硬生生地把我塞在國際旗幟之林，滿身污點，呌我有何面孔去見人呢？</p>
<p>這樣弄下去，看來一年三百六十日，都要捲曲在半空中，永無舒展於太空，一吸新鮮空氣的希望了。卽連今天，小子，我的最光榮的一日，也這樣冷氷氷地對待我，會也不開，假也不放，燈也不提，人也不見，究是好的什麽呢？小子，太　不過去了吧。</p>
<h3>國慶日的謎</h3>
<p>— 慈民</p>
<p>光榮的十月十日國慶日，加今早已蒙上了國難的羞暮。這還値得我們慶祝嗎？</p>
<p>我們應得想法把重重羞幕揭開啊！但是，怎樣才能揭開呢，我想，「十月十日」四字的謎底「朝」字，牠所暗示我們的方法，要算最好了。（一）在「朝」的袞袞諸公，不要「朝」洛陽跑，不要「朝」十里洋塲的上海跑，不要「朝」廣東跑，不要「朝」杭州跑；也不要伸長頭頸，兀是「朝」國際聯盟祈求，兀是「朝」太平洋西岸的國家「朝」拜。</p>
<p>（二）兵士們，將師們，不要把槍砲「朝」自己人轟擊，不要背轉身，「朝」關内溜之大吉；也不要碰着了東洋人，便垂頭喪氣，兩眼「朝」地上看，遇着了自己人，便得意揚揚，兩眼「朝」天上上張。</p>
<p>（三）豪富們，不要專事「志心朝裡」，商人們，不要四時八節向賊爺爺「朝」貢，靑年們，不要儘「朝」影戱院，跳舞塲，一味尋快樂。　　東方的「朝」陽，正在肆威，我們如不及早回頭，把「朝」字轉變個方向，那末，大中華民國，怕要成爲「朝」鮮第二了！朋友！國慶日的謎，你猜破了嗎！</p>
<h3>還得幾度重逢？濟翔</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>我的朋友常對我説：」眼前談什麽愛國？眞是傻瓜！國家大事，自有要人們去認眞負責：老百姓根本只許吃飯睡覺，定要不自安分，爬起來問問國家，結果是只有一埸没趣！亡國嗎？怕什麽？殺人又不殺你一個！地球邇早得破滅，彼時誰是光榮？誰是恥辱？還不是一樣完了！」</p>
<p>的確，眼前談國家，根本就有點無聊！一年一度，如今，又是國慶了。自然啦，「國難方殷，慶於何有？」國難中的國慶，有什麽値得慶祝呢？我説不對，唯其國難正　，更當及時行樂</p>
<p>怎講？</p>
<p>古人不是説嗎？「一生幾見月當頭？」今年不知明年，如此國慶，得知還有幾度重逢？趁國家猶在，不及時狂歡，又等待什麽？</p>
<p>於是，朋友舉盃相祝，和淚痛飲，相期非醉不止。也許主此醉死了，事情就更痛快！</p>
<h3>啼笑皆非的雙十節</h3>
<p>— 徐柏庵</p>
<p>流光如駛，轉瞬又是二十一年的國慶紀念日了；在辛刻亥諸先烈於削竿舉義，掃蕩了胡氛的時際，本也想把十月十日的那天作爲永恒的國慶紀念怕盛節，一則可以　幾千年來的專制之毒消滅於旦夕間的莫名的欣喜，再則是用以懐念那無數忠勇的志士戰死疆場的烈行的節季。但天下事竟有絲毫不能如人意的地方，那首次的國慶紀念日僅只能算是慶了一次的慶，因爲滿淸雖已宣告退位，國體雖已改了共和，而人民却依舊在貪官污吏重重剝削之下呻吟苟活，不曾得到些微民主政治的實惠，豈特是不曾得到實惠，不旋踵倒反而來了一個專制餘孽袁世凱的復辟運動，於是，討逆之軍興，防衛之師　，而小民百姓也便踏上了死亡的前程了。</p>
<p>我們只要把二十一年的雙十節粗粗的檢討一番，眞就夠我們疾首椎心，痛哭而失聲了！自袁世凱帝制運動失敗以後，接着便來了一個互續不斷的軍閥混戰：直皖之戰是那樣你踣我起，我踣你起的打得十分起勁；奉直之戰是連續到一次，兩次，三次，打個不停。其餘像江浙之戰也殺害了無數的生靈，四川的軍人是日以夜繼的在要老百姓的命。這其間人們雖也一年一度在無力地舉行着國慶紀念，可是，慶什麽呢？有什麽値得慶呢？這種國慶是多餘的國慶，這種紀念是撑場面的紀念，實際上，它給我們的倒是苦痛而不是歡樂呢！</p>
<p>自國民革命軍北伐完成以來，没有一個人不期待着國内政治澈底的改進，國際地位儘量的提高，和農村貧民的生活將得到怎樣安定與保障。然而那竟是一個夢，一個可悲的夢！中國的革命因着惡劣的民族性的遺留，爭權奪利的自私心無限制的擴張，竟然得不到一些美滿的善果。尤且叛變與伐俱興，發難與鎭壓並舉，弄到兵連禍結，民不聊生，和革命前的軍閥混戰幾二致！這其間，人們雖也一年一度在無力地舉行着國慶紀念，可是慶什麽呢？</p>
<p>有什麽値得慶呢？這種慶是多餘的國慶，這種紀念是撑場面的紀念，實際上，它給我們的倒是苦痛而不是歡樂呢！</p>
<p>自九一八瀋變爆發以來，二十年的國慶紀念變成凄凉而寂寞的喪儀；自一二八滬戰出演以來，二十一年的國慶紀念的無精打采是無待言的事。我們試想從有了國慶的一年到現在二十一年，這其間儘是那無　數的國恥紀念日的增加，而僅僅祇一個的國慶紀念日也已經飄搖欲墮，有點保持不牢了。要挽救危亡，要振興國運，要把所有的國恥紀念日盡變爲國慶紀念日，那也不難，祇要政府當軸從今起洗心革面，努力救國，小民百姓從今起奮發負責，一致抗日。然而，天哪！你不見膠東半島的韓劉二將軍正在磨拳擦掌，準備蚌鶔之爭？你不見四川那天富之國的武士都在厲兵秣馬，凖備鬩墻之戰？在這種環境中如何能抗日？在這種情勢下如何能救國？在這種邊堠未靜，内戰之火正待燃燒的時候，來舉行國慶紀念究有何種意義？這呌我笑不得，而也哭不得呢！</p>
<p>在一種啼笑皆非的情緒的支配下，我寫完了這一篇啼笑皆非的雙十節的文章。國慶紀念豈止是一年一度，可以敷衍了事，簡直是愈弄愈糟，國也將不國了！然而我們便這樣昏昏糊糊，氣得不去管賬麽？那是不對的，我們應該克服自己脆弱的性情，我們應該努力！我們必須用堅强的意志去作多方面的鬥爭！我們必須用不怕死的精神去打退我們的敵人！到那時候，國内的民賊與國際的敵人俱盡，那便是我們努力奮鬥的成功了，也便是我們無數的國恥日變爲國慶日的時期了！</p>
<p>在雙十節的前夜，謹以此義宣告於國内有志的靑年大衆之前。</p>

        <h1>1932.10.10</h1>
<h3>Two Major Premises for National Attention to Foreign Affairs　Yu Songhua</h3>
<p>Since the founding of the Republic of China, the people have celebrated National Day every year. Has there ever been a time when, due to the loss of territory and rights, we were at a loss, making people both cry and laugh, as is the case today? Even if we try hard to cheer and celebrate National Day today, the bloody battle of Shanghai feels like yesterday. The devastation is still evident and has not been restored. How can we not feel secretly saddened? Furthermore, thinking of the 30 million compatriots in the Northeast, for the past year, they have been living a miserable life of national subjugation and family destruction in deep water and scorching fire, and no one can save them. They have no way to go to heaven and no door to enter the earth. How can we not cry out in pain? On this day last year, the Northeast had already been occupied by the enemy. A cloud of sorrow and gloom enveloped the whole country, not unlike today. However, at that time, while the people were indignant at the tyranny of Japanese imperialism, they still hoped that the great powers could uphold justice, maintain international law and international conventions, stop Japan's aggression, and protect the integrity of our territory. Therefore, in our grief and indignation, there was still some hope and comfort. Now Japan has recognized the puppet state of Manchukuo, and the report of the League of Nations investigation team has also been published. Looking back at our country's diplomatic experience over the past year, where is the hope and comfort of this day last year?</p>
<p>Only with hope can there be comfort and a way out. With comfort and a way out, there is the possibility of striving for progress. Otherwise, even if we want to work hard, we will not know where to start and will be at a loss. Therefore, although there have been various disappointments in the past, from now on, the people of the country must learn from the past, find new ways out, and strive for renewed efforts. How to do this internally is not for now. Let's talk about foreign affairs.</p>
<p>Speaking of foreign affairs, there are two major and obvious premises that we cannot accept. One is that the survival of China lies only in the balance of power among the great powers. This is a special situation for China, and it seems unnecessary to deny it. Under this balance of power, if we cannot seek progress ourselves and rely on our own efforts to survive, then if there is a change in the balance of power, a great danger will immediately arise. Unless the balance of power is restored to its equilibrium, it is extremely difficult to have any hope of temporary peace. Second, the most important principle in diplomacy is to strive to "isolate the enemy and strengthen our support." Whether a country is strong or weak, it must always follow this principle. If, unfortunately, the course of events causes the environment and various facts to be exactly the opposite of this principle, no matter how strong or weak the country is, it will inevitably fail in its foreign affairs.</p>
<p>During the World War, the countries of Britain, France, Russia, Italy, Germany, and Austria were drawn into the vortex of war, fighting desperately and had no time to look eastward. At that time, the European powers were unable to maintain the balance of power in the Far East. Japan forced the Chinese government to sign the Twenty-One Demands. Fortunately, the United States had not yet joined the war, which was enough to restrain Japan. On the other hand, the overseas markets of the European powers were temporarily taken by the United States and Japan, and Japanese industry and commerce developed abnormally. The whole country was busy developing its economy externally. For China, it did not want to resort to military aggression immediately, which would sacrifice its once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for economic development. Therefore, although the balance of power changed, China was still able to survive temporarily. After the Washington Conference, a new balance of power among the great powers in the Far East was achieved. In terms of the external situation, this was a period of relative stability for China. Unfortunately, under this new balance of power, China still did not make progress and failed to strengthen itself and rely on its own efforts to survive. Therefore, when this new balance of power changed, Japan used military force to occupy our Northeast. As for why the new balance of power after the Washington Conference changed, to summarize, it was due to two major root causes: (1) The tide of economic panic swept across the world, and Japan was not fortunate enough to be an exception. However, the European and American powers were busy saving themselves and were exhausted. As a result, their power to maintain the new balance of power in the Far East was reduced. (2) During the London Naval Conference, Britain and the United States were linked together, and Japan had to make some concessions at the conference. It was still somewhat afraid of invading China. However, soon the power of the British Conservative Party rose, and Britain changed its policy to be pro-French and anti-American. In addition, there were many incidents in Europe, and countries were even more unable to take care of themselves. The new balance of power changed due to these two root causes. At this time, Japan, on the one hand, was eager to find a way out due to the economic panic, and on the other hand, it saw that the new balance of power was shaking. Its military leaders took this opportunity to quickly realize their plan to invade China by force. Alas, our people did not pay close attention to this change in the international situation at the beginning. Therefore, when the September 18th Incident occurred, there was no practical preparation or countermeasures beforehand. Afterwards, we vainly hoped that the great powers could help us repel the enemy. Now we suddenly realize that we have suffered a great loss.</p>
<p>Secondly, the reason why German Chancellor Bismarck was able to win consecutive victories in the Prussian-Danish, Prussian-Austrian, and Prussian-French wars was that he was able to consistently implement the principle of "isolating the enemy and strengthening our support" in diplomacy. Italian Prime Minister Cavour was able to free Italy from the shackles of Austria and France and complete unification because he was able to do his best to implement this principle. French Foreign Minister Delcassé once used this principle to deal with German Emperor Wilhelm II. Later, France was able to obtain strong support from many parties during World War I, which was not without the credit of Delcassé's diplomatic policy. Looking back at China's recent diplomacy, what was it like? At the beginning of the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army, the National Government in Wuhan had a relationship with Russia. It once recovered the British concession in Hankou and achieved a victory. Later, not only did it sever relations with Russia, but it also launched an armed confrontation with Russia over the Sino-Soviet Railway issue without any practical preparation for diplomacy and military affairs. As a result, the external situation and the views of the countries towards us changed. It is the hope of the people to "overthrow imperialism," but after severing relations with Russia, without any support and without any precautions, we still chanted this slogan, which only gave the enemy an excuse to make various unfavorable propaganda to the great powers. As a result, it did not help matters and instead aroused the jealousy of the great powers. As the saying goes, "using a stone to press your own foot," our country's diplomacy in recent years has been similar to this. The purpose of our government's diplomacy is indeed very proper, recognized and supported by the people. However, the methods adopted are different from those adopted by successful diplomats and politicians in the past, and the facts and environment have unfortunately gradually changed without our knowledge, making us stand in an isolated and helpless international position. If we do not seek truth from facts in our methods in the future, I am afraid it will be difficult to achieve the goal of revolutionary diplomacy.</p>
<p>The past cannot be undone, but the future can be pursued. What we hope for today is: (1) that the new balance of power in East Asia can be temporarily restored again, and (2) that our diplomatic authorities will abide by the ordinary principles that should be followed and work hard to carry out these two things. However, the world economic panic is overwhelming, and it is not known where it will end. The international situation is also changing rapidly and cannot be predicted. Whether the great powers can coordinate with each other, jointly put pressure on Japan, restore the balance of power in the Far East, and create a situation in which China can still survive temporarily is not certain. Even if the great powers have this intention, judging from Japan's recent reckless and unilateral actions, the Far East dispute may not be resolved by peaceful means. Therefore, the first hope is difficult to realize for a while. Even if it is realized, it is difficult to completely restore the situation before September 18 last year. In order to avoid future disappointment, this is what the people of the country should pay close attention to. As for the second hope, if the authorities are truly aware and make every effort to carry it out, it is possible to achieve it. Why do I say this? Because Japan has recently fully exposed its imperialist and ferocious face and its ambition to monopolize our Northeast, causing the great powers to look sideways. It has already created its own isolated and helpless international position. This is actually no different from digging its own grave. Therefore, what our country should strive for in diplomacy today is only to establish foreign support. Moreover, because Japan has already been isolated and helpless, we can use appropriate methods to establish foreign support, which will surely achieve twice the result with half the effort. This can be asserted.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that of the above two hopes, the first hope is not only difficult to realize, but even if it is realized, it may not be beneficial to China under the current situation. What remains is only the second hope of striving for foreign support. However, to seek foreign support, there are also various conditions. The most important thing is that we must have the determination, strength, and spirit of sacrifice to resist the enemy, as well as internal unity and consistency. If we ourselves have no determination and effort to resist, and at the same time, internal disputes continue to arise, and we hope that other countries will sacrifice for us and repel the enemy on our behalf, while we sit back and enjoy the fruits of their labor, then not only will we never get foreign support, but we will also help the enemy's arrogance and bring disaster upon ourselves. The various mistakes in the past have already created the dangerous situation today, in which we cannot live in peace for a day. How can we make the same mistake again in the future? We must know that it is not too late to turn back and change course. If we can make consistent efforts in the correct direction from now on, the failures of the past can still be gradually remedied, and the future will gradually improve and we will be able to succeed in everything. Otherwise, even if the enemy does many unjust things and will surely perish, can our Northeast affairs be recovered, and can the whole country avoid the tragedy of being divided and jointly managed by others? Alas, compatriots, will we be able to celebrate the Double Tenth Festival in the future? Or will we want to celebrate but be unable to do so? It all depends on whether our compatriots can recognize the objective facts, correct the mistakes of the past, make the determination to escape from death, and unite to strive for self-salvation. Time will not come again. My dear compatriots, encourage yourselves!</p>
<h3>Law, Struggle, and National Salvation</h3>
<p>This year is the twentieth National Day. But the country is fragmented and the national situation is declining to such an extent. The whole country is too grief-stricken to even think about celebrating. However, the foundation of the Republic of China was the price paid by countless martyrs. We are heartbroken by the bad situation and aware that the creation by the martyrs was not easy. What should we strive for and encourage ourselves to do?</p>
<p>In the old days, during the Roman era, the commoners fought with the nobles. The result of the struggle was the establishment of the Twelve Tables. In modern times, the French Revolution concentrated the power of the middle class and overthrew the feudal kingdom system, and then the Declaration of the Rights of Man was promulgated. The modern Russian Revolution, with the unity of the labor and peasant classes, succeeded Kerensky and overthrew the autocratic power of the Tsar, aiming to obtain bread and peace for the working people. Looking at history, the struggles of all nations have been driven by their special circumstances and have their own goals. Studying their content in detail, what they are fighting for is equality and security. Equality and security are the living conditions for human society and the normative basis for the society and the country. A state of inequality and insecurity is enough to destroy the existence of society internally and arouse the bullying of enemies externally. Therefore, inequality and insecurity are symbols of a state of anarchy, while security and equality are the beginnings of a state of law.</p>
<p>Before 1911, the martyrs shed hot blood, threw their heads, fell forward, and regarded death as home. What was the meaning of this? After 1911, the successive changes of dynasties resulted in the suffering of life. What was the meaning of this? It is said that the emperors of the autocratic era, the feudal warlords, and all the politicians who harmed the country and the people were all factors that created inequality and insecurity and must be eliminated. Therefore, inequality and insecurity are obstacles to the rule of law, and the struggle of our nation in the past fifty years has been a struggle for the law. The sacrifice of our martyrs has such a profound meaning. But the darkness of the situation today is so great. How can we not feel sad and mournful?</p>
<p>The struggle for the rule of law is a conscious impulse. With self-awareness, seeking one's own survival becomes more urgent. If someone wants to take my life or take away the rights on which I depend for survival, I will definitely resist. This is one meaning. It is true for individuals and for countries. Do we not see the praying mantis blocking the chariot and the trapped beast still fighting? Even birds and beasts have the instinct to struggle for survival. Why do we humans abandon ourselves? Therefore, individuals struggle for their own survival, and nations struggle for the survival of the country. What they are fighting for is nothing more than security and equality. Only after obtaining security and equality can we gradually achieve the rule of law. Therefore, it is said that the history of the struggle for survival is also the evolutionary history of law. Is nationalism another manifestation of the rule of law?</p>
<p>Our country's internal strife is endless, and foreign troubles are pressing. The crisis of the national situation is greater than today. Who caused it? Who did it? There are thousands of reasons, and it is impossible to break them down in one word. But the weakness of the national self-awareness is also a main reason. If the nation does not have self-awareness, it will not know the preciousness of the rule of law. Therefore, half of the country's land in the Northeast was handed over to others. The loss was in the morning, but it was crowned with the beautiful name of non-resistance. Therefore, there is no determination to recover the lost land from top to bottom, and we only think of relying on the incompetent League of Nations. Therefore, the warlords still engage in internecine warfare in the autumn of national survival. Since the nation has no hope of self-awareness, there is no security from foreign countries for one day, and there is no attempt to secure internal peace. The result is only to lead to destruction.</p>
<p>Our nation has little self-awareness of survival, and lacks the sentiment of the rule of law. As a result, the various phenomena manifested in the governance of society are incompatible with legal order. Take recent events as examples. In the Niu Lan case, a foreigner committed the crime of endangering the country. Because he was "a person concerned by world scholars," he repeatedly asked important people to bail him out. In the Zhang case, the composition of the crime was very popular. Therefore, important people sent telegrams to bail him out, hoping to settle the matter outside the judicial process. In the Yun Huifang case, a bomb was thrown to warn a traitorous merchant. Because there was a sign of attempted murder on the surface, the judge argued about the rigid interpretation of legal texts and ignored the highest ideal of the law. This is even more outrageous. In other cases, non-judicial organs can arbitrarily issue arrest warrants, and can arbitrarily carry out detention without legal procedures. All these actions have gone beyond the usual legal track, and the people's minimum security has lost its guarantee. As a result, the whole society has fallen into the abyss of chaos. What is transmitted by the ears and eyes is all confusion, and what is felt by the soul is all pessimism. Objectively speaking, all these phenomena are enough to promote the collapse of the country and deepen the degree of crisis.</p>
<p>Someone may say that since the Northern Expedition, the legal system has been updated and is a grand sight. Our country has everything that civilized countries in the world have. Our country also has all the latest laws and regulations of countries in the world. The greatness and speed of the legislative achievements of our National Government in the past three years should be surprising to legal scholars in the world. The progress of the rule of law movement in our country can be seen here. Who said that our country is a country without law? I say that the laws and regulations newly promulgated in our country are lengthy, but how many of them are suitable for the national conditions, and how many of them are unimpeded? It is difficult to say in general. Even the provisional constitution, the fundamental law, was first fiercely debated among the leaders, and then passed by the National Assembly. It should be a standard for gold and jade, and every sentence should be normative. It should be followed from top to bottom to guide the whole country to the right track of the rule of law. However, the protection of the minimum physical freedom, such as Article 8 of the law, which says that "people shall not be arrested, detained, interrogated, punished, or punished without due process of law," and the detailed rules attached to it, are畅行unimpeded. This is a big question. How much more can be said about others? However, it is not enough to be different from the rights of the people being ridiculed. However, since the central government is the central hub of the country, can its powers be exercised throughout the country as stated in the provisional constitution? Can its orders reach the whole country as expected by the provisional constitution? To be frank, we cannot but doubt it. All this is enough to prove that mere laws are not enough to go into effect by themselves. The essence of the rule of law does not lie in the completeness of the provisions in form, but in the spirit of effective implementation. If laws are made and destroyed, and all public and private acts choose ways outside the law, and discard laws like dung, then even if there are magnificent laws and regulations, they are only used to decorate the facade of a broken country.</p>
<p>Someone may say that the urgent tasks today are to resist Japan and suppress bandits. In a word, it is to secure the home and resist foreign aggression. What you said, mother and me are conservative. I should say, what is the purpose of securing the home and resisting foreign aggression? It is nothing more than to ensure the safety of the country and the nation. Safety is the foundation of the rule of law. Then the war of resistance against Japan is also the prelude to the rule of law movement. Those who despise the meaning of the anti-Japanese movement are also those who despise the greatness of the rule of law movement. Fighting to resist the enemy means maintaining one's personality, and the development of the rule of law depends on the expression of self-awakening. Those who despise the anti-Japanese movement are not only the kind of people who destroy their own personality, but also the kind of people who destroy the rule of law movement. This argument is definitely not slander. However, securing the home and resisting foreign aggression are only enough to lay the initial foundation for the rule of law, and have not yet reached the hall of the rule of law. Therefore, the whole country must earnestly encourage and cultivate the sentiment of law in the struggle for national survival.</p>
<p>What is the meaning of cultivating the sentiment of law? It is said that the establishment of norms and forms is secondary. The belief in law should be engraved in the hearts of everyone, so that everyone's consciousness is filled with the elements of legal sentiment. Then, from individual consciousness to social consciousness, the rule of law will have an indelible foundation. However, the cultivation of legal sentiment is not only the responsibility of law schools, not only the responsibility of all school education, but the responsibility of the whole country. It must be that the whole country recognizes that the rule of law is where the life of the nation lies and where the survival of the country depends. All public and private acts should be based on the interests of the public and the entire order should be the guideline. Then, the national customs will all conform to the norms, and the entire nation will have strict discipline. Treat the law as a treasure and do not give in to the law. Everyone has the fearless spirit of the rule of law. Then foreign insults are not enough to fear, and internal chaos is not enough to be quelled.</p>
<p>Someone may say, what you said is far-fetched and equal to a fool's dream. I should say that German jurist Iering is one of the people you admire the most. His book "Struggle for Law" is the basis for my theory. Therefore, I quoted his theory to end my article.</p>
<p>"If the country wants to secure the home and resist foreign aggression, the only good strategy is to cherish the spirit of law and cultivate the sentiment of law. This is the noblest career among the political gathering, education, and nurturing, and the source of the country's ability to survive. The most appropriate guarantee for survival both internally and externally is contained in the legal sentiment of every citizen. The sentiment of law is like the root of a big tree. If the root is not strong, where will the tree be attached?" Then, is what I said really argumentative?</p>

<h3>China's Self-Defense Problem - Zhang Zisheng</h3>
<p>In the current environment, when raising the issue of China's self-defense, most people will pay attention to how to improve the army, how to expand the fleet, and how to add aircraft. If these various aspects are merely superficial observations, it is not impossible to recognize them as urgent necessities. However, touching upon the reality of China's current self-defense will prove that such attention is superficial and irrelevant. Now, we will set aside more difficult to discuss issues such as military resources, transportation capabilities, and new weapons, and only examine what the general public pays attention to. The most necessary condition for the improvement of the Chinese army is effective political measures; the hallmark of the expansion of the Chinese fleet should be having enough ships to defend the entire coastline; and the addition of Chinese military aircraft should at least be in proportion to Japan's eight hundred aircraft. These three necessities require tens of millions of funds, a long period of many years, and a certain number of talents of all kinds to be effective. However, the current situation definitely does not allow China the leisure to complete this self-defense plan at a slow pace. The most urgent form required in China's current self-defense problem is the reserve of civilian armed forces. This can be proven from all aspects. (1) In the past eighty years, China's military center has shifted from the Green Standard Army to the Xiang Army and Huai Army, from the Xiang Army and Huai Army to the Beiyang Army, and from the Beiyang Army to revolutionary soldiers. The traces of this metabolism can be examined in historical facts. Now, Zhang Xueliang, possessing an army of 200,000, dares not resist Japan. More than three hundred aircraft purchased from various countries in Shenyang are stored to aid the enemy, while the Northeastern Volunteer Army, composed of untrained people, confronts the Japanese army equipped with new-style weapons, engaging in bloody battles, supporting each other for months without faltering. This is the trend of the nation's military center shifting to the people. (2) Look at various countries around the world. Post-war Germany, bound by treaties, has had its national military equipment reduced to the lowest limit on the surface. However, its people have sufficient armed forces in reserve, so that even though they were victorious in war, other countries dare not underestimate their national power. Even the United States, which is known as a powerful nation, only uses its standing mercenary army for peacetime preparation, with the main body of national defense being the militia. During the European War, the United States participated in the war against Germany with an army of four million, and when it was demobilized, the regular standing army was only 225,000. Among the countries of the world, Switzerland in Central Europe has the smallest standing army. However, the armed forces reserved by its people are enough to make the great powers have considerable fear, so even though it is located between Germany, France, Italy, and Austria, it can avoid the impact of the European War and maintain its permanent neutral position. This is the global trend of national military power being hidden among the people. (3) General Wei Yisan's military preparation plan mentioned a method of training 180 million people for the people's militia. Its purpose is to enable the people in the combat area to have combat ability, alert ability, intelligence ability, and the ability to carry out night attacks and surprise attacks on the enemy due to the organization of the militia. At the same time, the people in the non-combat area will have the ability to suppress bandits and communists due to the organization of the militia. Once the local garrison is deployed, it can protect the local area. In the event of a defeat on the front line and enemy invasion, it also has the ability to surprise the enemy and recover the army. This is the advocacy of Chinese military officers that the people must have armed forces in reserve.</p>
<p>Please further discuss the relationship between civilian armed forces and national self-defense. The most practical purpose of China's current self-defense problem is to make the enemy invading our territory suffer the losses they deserve and have no choice but to retreat. At the same time, those who are eyeing us covetously will clearly understand that military aggression is not entirely in their favor and will not act lightly. Some people speculate that if the Japanese army had known about the situation of the Northeastern Volunteer Army's resistance today, they would not have acted so rashly on September 18 last year. We cannot easily say whether this speculation is accurate. However, the effect of this Chinese civilian armed force of the Northeastern Volunteer Army is that, on the one hand, it allows the Chinese people to maintain a long-term struggle against the enemy army in the more than 4.7 million square miles of Chinese territory that has been invaded and occupied, making the enemy exhausted in dealing with it. If they can persist for a long time, then there is the precedent of the great powers withdrawing their troops from Siberia. The forced withdrawal of the Japanese army from the Northeast is not necessarily an impossible thing. On the other hand, since the rise of the Volunteer Army, the Japanese army's attempt to expand the scope of its occupation has been greatly affected. We can know from the effectiveness of this untrained, unassisted civilian armed force that if the government makes planned reserves for civilian armed forces, it will surely demonstrate greater merit for the country's self-defense.</p>
<p>China's formal army cannot confront the armies of the great powers with certainty unless it possesses all the necessary weapons and equipment and conditions for modern warfare. This can be learned from the defeat of Liang Zhongjia and Han Guangdi in the Battle of Manzhouli in the eighteenth year. Furthermore, we learn another lesson from the bitter fighting and sacrifice of the 19th Route Army in the January 28th Battle this year. Because the invading enemy army, holding new and sharp weapons, attacks with its aircraft, heavy artillery, tanks, and chemical warfare agents, the current Chinese army will definitely find it difficult to win against the enemy, which is an inevitable fact. However, in the guerrilla warfare of the civilian army, the enemy's various new-style weapons are not easy to show their full effect. This is why Liang Han's loyal and capable army could not recover after one defeat, while the untrained Northeastern Volunteer Army was able to fight a sustained confrontation with the Japanese army. We know that since the reorganization of Liang Han's old troops, they have still failed to supplement the necessary weapons and equipment according to the needs of modern warfare, and we know that the 19th Route Army still lacked what it lacked after the Shanghai War, thus clarifying the difficulty of improving the formal Chinese army, and increasing our belief in the applicability of civilian armed forces to China's self-defense. We do not fail to hope for the improvement and expansion of China's army, navy, and air force, and to make the 19th Route Army a modern army that can fight modern warfare is not very difficult. However, the lessons learned over a considerable period of time make us have to entrust the responsibility of China's self-defense to civilian armed forces. Therefore, if we want to talk about China's self-defense problem today, the most urgent thing is to earnestly assist the Northeastern Volunteer Army on the one hand, so that this existing civilian armed force will not be destroyed by the enemy; on the other hand, to enrich the reserves of civilian armed forces to meet the needs of the environment.</p>
<h3>Implementing Controlled Economy - Wu Gan</h3>
<p>This year's Double Tenth Festival coincided with a time of national crisis, which really does not inspire our celebration. However, now that the country has not yet perished, and the National Day commemoration can still be celebrated freely, it is always good for everyone to celebrate a bit. As the ancient saying goes, "Gather ye rosebuds while ye may, Old Time is still a-flying." It is like the current political chaos, warlords are rampant, putting state affairs aside, just fighting for power. They are doing their best to cause internal strife and are even afraid to lose a single arrow externally. We are afraid that there will really be a time when there are "no rosebuds to gather," and at that time, even celebrations will be impossible. Therefore, upholding the intention of "deep sorrow inspiring sages and hardship building the nation," let us say a few words of celebration and encouragement to share with our countrymen.</p>
<p>I feel that if the country wants to save itself in the future, it must at least establish a basic principle: "Thoroughly reform politics, and then implement a controlled economy." My original intention is entirely in the latter; however, the major premise of the former should be especially emphasized. The state of Chinese politics is worse than it is today, but everyone always holds a fatalistic mentality and can do nothing about it. At the beginning of the National Revolutionary Movement, "Down with imperialism" and "Down with warlords" were once used as the two major goals of political reform. However, now, not only has imperialism not been overthrown, it has occupied half of our country. As for the power of warlords in various places, it is only greater than before. But who dares to say "Down with" now? Without overthrowing the warlords, there will be no day for the thorough clarification of politics, let alone planned economic construction. Therefore, I believe that thoroughly reforming politics is the only major premise for self-rescue at present. The starting point for political reform is to eliminate the warlord system. The most important condition for eliminating the warlord system is that military personnel must absolutely not interfere in civil affairs and must only purely assume the task of defending against insults and suppressing bandits. If this minimum limit can be achieved, there will be a way in politics, and we can then talk about economic construction. Otherwise, everything is nonsense.</p>
<p>Speaking of China's current economic construction, there are numerous complexities; however, we must also have a fundamental principle: "A planned and unified economic control policy."</p>
<p>Originally, the trend of modern economy roughly follows three directions: The first is a free economy, which is the major principle of capitalist development. However, even to this day, there are really many malpractices. The phenomena of "the crowd overcoming the few" and "the strong merging the weak" can be discovered at any time in the free competition economic arena. In recent years, the "industrial rationalization movement" once caused a sensation for a while. Many countries also wanted to use this to open a new situation for the free economy, but the result only promoted an unprecedented world economic panic. So how can we open up a path from free competition? Moreover, with China's current backward industrial and commercial nation, to freely compete with other capitalist countries, it is only naturally in an inferior and defeated position. This is something we should reflect on.</p>
<p>Secondly, the promotion of state-owned enterprises has also not lacked advocates in recent years. And in fact, many countries have implemented various state-owned enterprises. For example, railways, shipping, telegrams, telephones, mines, and other industries are almost all state-operated in various countries around the world. The state completely stands in the position of private enterprises to compete with general merchants in the commercial arena. There is originally nothing to criticize about this type of economic organization. The difficult thing is that the expansion of state-owned enterprises is really difficult to achieve in our country at present. Because if large enterprises are converted into state-owned enterprises, both "uncompensated confiscation" and "compensated purchase" will become very difficult problems to solve. A month ago, the Guangzhou Municipal Government forcibly took over the power company as municipal property, which caused a great storm. This is an example. As for "compensated purchase," it is absolutely impossible to talk about this level with the financial resources of our government at present. For example, the capital of a public utility such as the Shanghai Power Company is 90 million taels (?), which is more than the national maritime customs revenue of any year before 1928. Again, a national planned economy is also recognized as a more advanced modern economic development trend than state-owned enterprises; however, it is also impossible to implement in China at present. Not to mention that a certain minister's ten-year railway plan and a certain director's five-year industrial plan have long become historical terms; even if we really want to implement them in order according to a certain number of years of planning, there are various difficulties in fact. Originally, the characteristic of a national planned economy is that all economic organizations in the country must have very close contact with each other, and the highest economic organ that issues instructions must have absolute control ability. For example, the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan and New Five-Year Plan are implemented step by step in accordance with a certain direction. But what about in our country? Each railway is governed separately, and many do not listen to the instructions of the Ministry of Railways; and the administration of the Ministry of Railways itself and the Ministry of Communications seems to be that they do not conspire together. In addition to the Ministry of Communications, there is also the so-called "Construction Committee," which has also built many transportation-related businesses. Just from this small example, we can also see the difficulty of implementing a national planned economy at present. What's more, in addition to political difficulties, there are also financial difficulties, and the obstruction of warlords in various places! As well as the secret sabotage of imperialism, how can the entire system of national planned economy be implemented at present?</p>
<p>Since the malpractices of a free economy are great and do not help the future of economic construction, and there are many financial difficulties in state-owned enterprises, and a national planned economy is even more difficult to implement without a strong political system, then the only thing left is to pursue an effective and relatively easy-to-implement "controlled economy." Some people say that "controlled economy" is actually the inevitable trend of economic organization development. Since the world's financial panic followed the industrial panic and expanded in the second half of last year, "controlled economy" has almost become the most important economic policy of modern countries, which shows that this trend of the times is rising day by day.</p>
<p>The content of this controlled economy is that the state establishes various laws and regulations to control all economic or certain economic activities. At present, the more common scope of controlled economy in the world is "exchange control" and "trade control." The main purpose of exchange control is to prevent cash from escaping the country; while trade control is to restrict unnecessary imports in order to improve international lending and borrowing and to be in an advantageous position. In addition, there are also advocates for controlling financial and credit businesses, state-owned and private enterprises, agricultural and labor businesses, and even major specialized industries, such as the silk industry and the rice industry. Although the effect of controlled economy in recent years has not been great, many countries are doing their best to promote it. Originally, although this economic nationalism does have something to criticize in theory, such as the Berlin World Economic Conference in early May this year, which attributed the world's economic downturn to trade barriers, import restrictions, and trade management and other actions that hinder trade; and the last report of the International League Council Committee, which proposed the world economic panic remedy policy, also regarded abolishing international trade restrictions, such as tariffs and exchange controls, as the main plan. From the perspective of free trade theory, this is of course a matter of course; but in the face of the current fierce international economic competition, who is willing to sacrifice their own national interests first to seek the welfare of world harmony? Therefore, despite the high-pitched calls for abolishing trade restrictions, countries are actually carrying out plans for economic control more and more fiercely. Living in this big circle of the times, how can we not find a way to deal with it?</p>
<p>From the perspective of China's current situation, not to mention economic invasion, but only seeking economic self-reliance, it is also necessary to implement economic control. Originally, all of our country's economic activities are like a plate of scattered sand, so that the financial and trade power is entirely in the hands of foreigners, listening to their arrangements; and all domestic production businesses are also unable to correspond to supply and demand due to the lack of a comprehensive planning plan, and cannot be systematically adjusted. Therefore, a complete economic control plan is really urgently needed at present. We have recently seen a very good example: last year, the Bank of China invited yarn factories and cotton merchants to form a China Cotton Industry Company to purchase cotton in Shandong, Shaanxi, and Henan. In one year, they bought more than 40,000 bales. With such a small private control mechanism, both parties have already felt great convenience in terms of the need for the distribution of goods. If the government and various merchants were to implement a larger-scale control, wouldn't the benefits to production and sales be even greater? Otherwise, there is a risk of goods being abandoned on the ground in the interior, while the treaty ports cannot bear the pressure of foreign goods. Therefore, planned production control and sales control are simply necessary.</p>
<p>There are many similar situations in our country's current production businesses. For example, although silk, tea, and soybeans have always been major exports, they have always been subject to the manipulation of foreign merchants. For another example, the import of foreign goods greatly suppresses the development of domestic industry, and our country has always been unable to do anything about it. But now that our country's tariffs are already autonomous, why not try to remedy the situation? In terms of "trade control," more than 20 countries in the world have already implemented it, and quite a few countries have already achieved results. There are many types of methods they use to control trade, but the common principle is to restrict or even prohibit the import of imports that are considered unnecessary. This method can be implemented by other autonomous countries, and our country can of course follow suit. Trade control is only one of the most important types of economic control. All other economic businesses in our country can also be planned comprehensively and establish control methods to break the current scattered organization. In short, in the current era of increasingly fierce international competition, other countries are attacking with organized and planned economic invasion methods, while our country is scattered and unprepared, and will inevitably be eliminated naturally in the end. What's more, now that the country is in dire straits, after the Japanese imperialists occupied the eastern provinces, they have also begun to discuss "Japan-Manchuria economic control policies" on a large scale in order to "domesticate the markets of Manchuria and Mongolia." Let's not talk about armed resistance for the time being, can't we also urgently pursue and discuss planned economic resistance methods?</p>
<h3>The Future of the Three Northeastern Provinces Issue</h3>
<p>That our country is a single, indivisible nation, and that no force should be allowed to forcibly partition it, is a fact known and seen by all. Furthermore, the uniformity of our people, the perfection of our written language, and the closeness of our lifestyles mean that, although separation has been inevitable at times over the past three thousand years, we have always reunited. Therefore, we can proudly proclaim ourselves a unified and complete nation without shame. The three provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang are located far in the Northeast. Since the Tang Dynasty, they have been part of China's territory. When the Manchus entered and ruled China, their laws and institutions were almost completely assimilated with the Han people, blending into one. The Qing court was weak and incompetent to the extreme, but progress among the people did not stagnate excessively due to the government's influence, although it was somewhat delayed. After the establishment of the Republic of China, although the government failed to truly achieve democracy, the movement towards democracy grew stronger day by day, which is an obvious fact. Even though years of internal warfare have led to various political instabilities within the country, and the central and local governments often seemed to be independent of each other, the people's tendency to unite and their hope for unification were genuine and sincere. In the past twenty years, despite being eroded by strong enemies from abroad and ravaged by warlords at home, we have strived to find our own way out of hardship. As for the disaster in the Northeast, it did not begin today. The defeat in the Sino-Japanese War and the ceding of land for peace planted the seeds of future problems. During the Russo-Japanese War, we failed to seize the opportunity to save ourselves, and we let the golden opportunity of the European War slip by lightly. Even when the Northern Expedition succeeded and unification was achieved, we did not hear of any grand plans for the Northeast, which was in a precarious situation. Last June, when Uchida Kosai, a veteran of the diplomatic world, was appointed president of the South Manchuria Railway, and Ugaki Kazushige, a leader of the Choshu clique, was appointed Governor-General of Korea, it was clear that they were preparing to seize the Three Northeastern Provinces. At that time, people whispered that a disaster might befall the Northeast! Unfortunately, our authorities were too complacent and fearless in the face of these events, which led the Japanese to instigate Koreans to create the Wanpaoshan Incident, resulting in the massacre of overseas Chinese in Korea. We still lacked effective countermeasures and were swayed by the enemy's intentions. There could not have been a worse miscalculation!</p>
<p>When the enemy sent out scouts to prepare for a large-scale invasion, we were still sound asleep, simply ignoring the situation. As a result, the "Nakamura Incident," a small spark, ignited a prairie fire. As for the so-called Captain Nakamura (Shintaro), he had entered the interior of Boketu without cause as a military spy, and therefore met with an accident and died. In terms of both reason and justice, not only should our country not bear any responsibility, but we should also lodge a strong protest and make every effort to prevent such incidents from happening again. However, the responsible authorities in the Northeast at the time sought to compromise in everything. Unexpectedly, this fueled the aggressive fervor of the Japanese militarists, who used the "Captain Nakamura Incident" as the sole pretext for invading and occupying the Northeast. The South Manchuria Railway bombing incident, as promoted by the Japanese side, seemed to be a real event, but in reality, it was a smokescreen for their military operations. Its main purpose was to deceive their own people and incite anti-Chinese sentiment among the Japanese. The secondary purpose was to leave room for diplomatic maneuvering, just like the conspiracy of the January 28th Shanghai Incident this year. After the incident broke out, our troops retreated without a fight (the Shanghai Incident involved the 19th Route Army and the 5th Army in a thirty-one-day resistance, so Shanghai was barely preserved thanks to that battle), losing ground step by step. It is a common principle in wars between countries that when they retreat, we advance, and when we retreat, they advance. Therefore, the more we retreated and conceded, the more aggressive and forceful the enemy became. Shenyang and Jilin were surrendered without a fight, and it was difficult to hold on to the Jinzhou area. As a result, the Japanese safely occupied Jinzhou without firing a shot. Only the troops stationed in the Black Mountain and White Water area and the brigade led by Ma Zhanshan, although located in remote border areas, were able to maintain the glory of our nation and engage in a desperate struggle with the powerful neighbor. Even though the railway lines were trampled everywhere by enemy cavalry, a corner of the land still preserved the future vitality of our nation. However, modern civilization is built on economic foundations, and since railway transportation is monopolized by the enemy, our actions are naturally constrained by them. Therefore, the cunning Japanese, using their imperialistic schemes, seized the economic center with forceful means on the one hand, and used money to buy off selfish and self-serving traitors like Xiao Xinbo, Yu Chonghan, and Zhang Hai Peng, who only cared about their personal comfort and ignored the survival of the country and the nation, as their lackeys. On the other hand, they used the name of Manchuria and the Manchu people to lure Aisin-Gioro Puyi out of Guan, and from the so-called local maintenance association, they brewed a "made-in-Japan" national independence signboard to deceive the people of the Three Northeastern Provinces, deceive European and American countries, and deceive the pure and good people of Japan, in order to fulfill their militarist ambitions of aggression. By March 1st of this year, they had created a puppet organization, which they euphemistically called the Manchurian (Pseudo) State. On March 8th, the Japanese army transported a puppet in a special train to Changchun, bestowing upon him the fine name of Executive, establishing official positions and granting titles, and even changing the era name, as if it were a real event. But what is the reality when we examine it closely? (1) The "Wangdaoism" (Way of Benevolent Rule) they tout, and the new policies they implement, such as "eradicating oppressive government and warlord forces," are all masks for military aggression and economic aggression (the so-called development of industry). It is the first step in using their old trick of subjugating Korea to annex the three northeastern provinces. (2) The so-called "harmony of East Asian nations"</p>
<p>is nothing more than a different name for the "East Asian Monroe Doctrine," and its brutality is even worse. Take the organization of the Manchurian puppet government as an example. Although the ministers of the various departments under its executive are all people like Shi Jingtan who have surrendered to the Japanese, the actual power is entirely in the hands of a group of people with dual nationality (Japanese). These strange officials with the "Japanese inside and Manchurian outside" total about six hundred, supplemented by Japanese troops and Japanese police. Therefore, Manchuria (the puppet) truly lives up to its name as a thoroughly "made-in-Japan" puppet. (3) The so-called "will of the people" is especially ingenious. Although the Japanese police have painstakingly gone out to buy people off, there are still very few who follow them. Even with 100,000 Japanese troops, they cannot maintain security and order along the railway lines. Such is the so-called "new situation."</p>
<p>Since the puppet organization is so chaotic and the pseudo-government is so incompetent, how will it stand on its own, and how can 200,000 Japanese people invade the Three Northeastern Provinces? The answer is that there is a reason for this. The Japanese have been planning to seize the Three Northeastern Provinces for more than a day, and it was only fully exposed last year. The Kwantung Army Independent Garrison stationed along the South Manchuria Railway Line, although nominally only six infantry battalions and one artillery battalion, actually has a total of no less than 8,000 combat troops. Before the September 18th Incident last year, they secretly transferred the 1st Division from Sendai and the 20th Division from Ryuzan (Korea) by night train to be stationed along the South Manchuria Railway Line. Therefore, after the fabricated Beidaying Incident broke out, Fengtian and Jilin fell within a day. However, the vast wilderness of Liaoning and Jilin, and our patriotic soldiers constantly resisting the enemy, made it very difficult for the 40,000 troops to barely maintain the security of the main cities. Therefore, at the beginning of the Shanghai War, they wanted to divert the attention of the Chinese people from focusing on the Northeast to focusing on Shanghai, in order to facilitate their annexation. Knowing that they had not succeeded in the Battle of Shanghai, the courage of the Northeast people to resist Japan increased as a result. Therefore, the Japanese increased their troops even more. In addition to transferring the entire 14th Division of Utsunomiya, which participated in the Shanghai War, to the Northeast, they also drew special forces (cavalry and artillery) from the 5th Division of Kashima and the 3rd Division of Nagoya and increased them to the front lines in the Northeast. However, their effectiveness was still limited, and they could not resist the volunteer armies with a strong spirit of national resistance. Three months ago, they again used the pretext of rotation to transfer the 8th Division of Hirosaki and the 10th Division of Himeji to the Northeast. The 8th Division was stationed in the South Manchuria area and along the Siping-Taonan Railway Line, and the 10th Division went to Harbin and other places. They also drew special forces (cavalry and artillery) from various divisions (whose numbers are currently unknown) to replace some of the tired infantry. Judging from the current situation, the Japanese army, although strong, will not easily stabilize the territory it has invaded. If the activities of the volunteer armies can be further organized and strengthened, it will not be difficult to engage in a long-term struggle with the Japanese army. Japan has used violent means to attack the Northeast, invade and occupy territory, and oppress our people. Our country can no longer tolerate this and must rise up to resist. All the major powers in Europe and America also regard our country as the most promising</p>

<p>place for the resurgence and the only effective market to relieve the economic panic of the modern world. The Three Northeastern Provinces are especially a complete virgin land. If they are completely monopolized by the Japanese, how can the countries be willing to accept this and let them annex it? Here, I will specifically describe the attitudes of the major industrial countries of the world towards the Northeast:</p>
<p>1.  The United States seems to have very little connection with the Northeast, and lacks inseparable economic ties. Its goodwill towards China seems to be very genuine and relatively pure. However, because it is relatively pure, its goodwill towards China feels even more diluted. In today's world (especially in international relations), whether interests align is the biggest prerequisite for cooperation. The financial capital of the United States has reached its peak and has a strong tendency to lead the world. However, after the economic panic struck, Europe was the first to bear the brunt, and the United States, which had enjoyed long-term prosperity, suffered even more severely. Since South America was affected, the Monroe Doctrine had no room to be implemented. Opening up the (Chinese) market became an inevitable trend. Unexpectedly, Japan suddenly adopted militaristic preemptive policies, disregarding the connections of various countries and ignoring Sino-Japanese relations, and wantonly invaded and occupied the Three Northeastern Provinces, causing the most promising market for the future of the United States to be cut off by more than half for no reason. How could they not be angry! However, anger is just anger. The United States is extremely precise in its calculations of interests, and is especially unwilling to be rash and take risks. At present, the aftermath of the economic panic has not subsided, and the feverish momentum of Japan is on the rise. They will carefully calculate: On the one hand, they will make practical preparations for naval power, and on the other hand, they will form alliances of offense and defense through international relations. Although they may not be able to achieve their desired results, they should at least seek the understanding of Britain and the United States, and even the understanding of the United States and the Soviet Union, before they can deal with Japan. Therefore, at this moment, the most the United States can do is to protest.</p>
<p>2.  Britain and France are inherently incompatible in Europe, but they have some common ground on China, and they are at least not as sharp towards Japan as the United States. As for Britain, it is difficult to be consistent with Japan in the Yangtze River basin, but it has compromised with Japan. The internal reason is that the centrifugal tendency of the various ruled territories is too great, forcing them to do so. In addition, the Soviet Union is progressing steadily, from the construction of its own territory to the success of the Turkestan-Siberian Railway and the industrialization of Central Asia, which will inevitably move south to India. The industrialization of Siberia means that it is eyeing Northern Manchuria. Britain must maintain the security of India, while Japan will form a monopoly in the Three Northeastern Provinces. At the same time, Britain and Japan are both major investing countries in China (with more than 1.25 billion US dollars each), and they are deeply unwilling to see the rise of Chinese national capital. Therefore, supporting China to defend against Russia is their top priority. France initially only wanted to maintain Western hegemony and strengthen its strength in the East, so it contacted Japan. Recently, Germany and Italy have become closer, and the Treaty of Versailles is difficult to maintain. For the sake of its current interests, it must actively support the credibility of the League of Nations. Therefore, Britain and France often adopted a fence-sitting attitude towards the issue of the Three Northeastern Provinces in the past, allowing the situation to change. Recently, they have slightly intended to maintain peace and restrain Japan. However, this intention is likely to be mostly related to diplomatic relations, and its actual effect is very small.</p>
<p>3.  The Soviet Union, the Three Northeastern Provinces, and our country and Japan originally formed a tripartite opposition. If our country is present, although the conflict between Japan and the Soviet Union will intensify, our presence in the middle can alleviate it a lot. Now that Japan occupies the Three Northeastern Provinces, the conflict between Japan and the Soviet Union will become more and more blatant and hardened. Even if the Soviet authorities are vigilant about the crisis and prepare for everything in advance, exchanging oil for peace in order to focus on the construction of the Second Five-Year Plan, Japan's greed is endless. The Three Northeastern Provinces are not enough to satisfy its desires, and red oil cannot quench its thirst. Japan and the Soviet Union will eventually have a war, but it will take time to find a trigger.</p>
<p>(Germany and Italy are too far away from China, and their relationship is very small, so I will omit them.)</p>
<p>Our China is the master of the Three Northeastern Provinces, and in principle, we should have the highest right to dispose of them. However, due to a lack of strength, we cannot (at least not at present) recover the Three Northeastern Provinces by force and restore the old territory. Since war is not possible, we must negotiate for peace. When the incident first broke out last year, if our authorities could have endured humiliation and borne the burden, and immediately engaged in direct negotiations, although we would inevitably lose the four South Manchuria Railways and other economic benefits, we could have recovered administrative power, reduced general suffering, and made it easier to work hard to strengthen ourselves. Today, the "made-in-Japan" puppet state has been established, and Japan's continental policy cannot be stopped. I am deeply afraid that direct negotiations will be impossible, and the Japanese will threaten us with "faits accomplis." The result of direct negotiations, in addition to being humiliated in vain, may also involve our rights in North China.</p>
<p>Since "direct negotiations" were lost after the Shenyang Incident last year, the three provinces have been engulfed and North China is in turmoil. We trusted the League of Nations in the past and hoped that the League of Nations could restrain Japan, but the two resolutions of September 30th and October 24th were equal to waste paper with black and white characters. The resolution of November 10th to send a League of Nations investigation team to the East arrived in Japan on February 29th of this year, when the sounds of artillery fire in Shanghai shook the sky. It arrived in Shanghai in mid-March, entered the Three Northeastern Provinces on April 21st, and returned to Beiping in early June to draft a report. It took more than six months. How much has our country gained from the released report now, and how much has the so-called justice been realized? All of this does not need to be guessed, and the past is clear. Even if Britain and France behind the League of Nations want to reluctantly maintain the realization of the report, they may not be able to limit Japan's military atrocities. Japan's barbarism cannot be contained, and our country has no way to reason. Britain and France can only play with diplomatic rhetoric at this time, making generalized discussions of mediation, and ultimately allowing the strong to act tyrannically. However, as the general trend of the world develops, and countries open up markets with all their strength, how can they allow Japan to monopolize them? For the time being, they may only engage in verbal arguments, but preparations for artillery fire are becoming more and more active. Japan's new naval budget accounts for more than one-quarter of its total expenditure. If it is said that they are not in a hurry to prepare for war, who would believe it! Therefore, the United States, which is the first to bear the brunt, seems unlikely to sit idly by. Britain has occupied the throne of the sea for a long time, how can it stand by? The Soviet Union is watching covetously and will eventually rise up. Then the Second World War will use the Three Northeastern Provinces as a powder keg, and its explosiveness will be even greater than that of the Balkans before 1914.</p>
<p>What should our Chinese nation do at this time? Are the Three Northeastern Provinces today the Alsace-Lorraine between Germany and France? Is China today the Turkey that was defeated in the war? It depends on our people to do it themselves. The extremely exhausted farmers and workers are indeed the foundation of nation-building, but if they have no way to make a living and are plagued by hunger and cold, how can they have the "vitality" to devote themselves to the struggle for national rejuvenation? The deeply lazy bureaucrats and warlords are unlikely to have the skills to revive the nation. Today, those who can rise up in time to relieve the people's difficulties at home and resist strong enemies abroad and serve as the vanguard of the national struggle seem to be the middle-class elements in distress. However, the situation is critical, and the national strength is declining. These difficulties cannot be resolved in a short time with a single effort. We must work hard with the greatest determination and unwavering effectiveness in order to find a way out for the nation, in order to recover lost territory. Moreover, the current enemy is not comparable to the incompetent. The victory or defeat of this kind of intense national struggle is certainly not determined in an instant, but we cannot easily let go of any opportunity, so that we can fight for a hundred years, avenge the nation's humiliation, and complete the historical mission of national revival.</p>
<p>In the near future, the League of Nations will not be able to force Japan to return the Three Northeastern Provinces, and our people may not be able to recover them by force immediately. Apart from this, the first requirement for the final total liquidation is to see how our people continue to work hard, and the second is to see if we have the spirit of desperate struggle. Only then can we reap the final results during the Second World War.</p>

<p>Memorial Address</p>
<h3>National Day and National Crisis (1)</h3>
<p>In the midst of the current troubles of both internal and external problems, the National Day celebration for the 21st year of the Republic of China has arrived. I still remember this day last year, when this newspaper published an article titled "From This Year's Double Tenth Festival to Next Year's Double Tenth Festival." It laid out a one-year plan and solemnly exhorted the people with the phrase "Yesterday's Death, Today's Life," hoping to overcome the national crisis and gradually propel our nation onto a path of brightness. Now, a year has swiftly passed. However, upon examining the current state of our nation's politics and economy over the past year, and the impoverishment of its people, we cannot help but admit that the "national crisis" not only remains unchanged, but the dangers have also increased. National economy and people's livelihood are on the brink of the most serious situation. Today, as we stand beneath the national flag waving in the brisk autumn wind, looking ahead and looking back, we only feel filled with grief and resentment, and our eyes are full of bitterness. The years pass slowly, and the long nights are endless. If this year is like this, we don't know what next year will be like. Even wanting to force a smile through our tears is impossible. It is only "difficulty." What "celebration" is there to speak of?</p>
<p>Of course, the arrival of the "national crisis" is not accidental, nor is it due to "heaven punishing us" or "merciless heaven." From the external aspect, the coming of foreign troubles has its own international political and economic background. From the internal aspect, the occurrence of internal strife and the increasing decline of the social economy, as well as the increasing destitution of people's livelihoods, also have their own real causes.</p>
<p>Since the first wave of the world economic panic emerged in the United States in 1929, not only has there been no slight turning point until now, but it has become increasingly deep and worsened. Furthermore, due to the agitation of the economic panic, a political panic has unfolded along with it. Capitalist countries, in order to save their declining fate, have had to exert all their strength to compete for raw material fields, compete for markets, compete for investment locations, and compete for colonies. In other words, they are re-dividing the world. China, as a country with backward production, as an undeveloped and abundant region, and as a large market with a dense population, is also a de facto semi-colony that has fallen into the tragic situation of economic aggression by advanced capitalist countries. Of course, in the turbulent international political situation, and in the situation where the powers are actively preparing to divide the Far East market, China's "foreign troubles" naturally come one after another. This is an inevitable trend.</p>
<p>Secondly, since the Opium War, the economic power of advanced capitalist countries has directly extended into our rural areas. Our agricultural economy has consequently approached the brink of collapse and ruin day by day. Furthermore, due to the machinations of imperialists and the final struggle of residual feudal forces, our nation's politics have been unable to get on track. Thus, wars and chaos occur from time to time, taxes and levies are heavy, and disasters occur frequently, accelerating the collapse of the agricultural economy. At present, the entire social economy and national finances are showing a state of "bankruptcy." People's livelihoods are becoming increasingly impoverished, and the social economy is falling into turmoil and unrest. This also has its own reasons, and it is by no means accidental.</p>
<p>In short, in a turbulent world, China's unrest is an inevitable trend. If we only deeply express sighs of emotion and grief about the increasing severity of the national crisis, and cannot grasp this "inevitable" trend, then we will forever be trapped in confusion and disappointment. That is to say, we will never be able to "break the national crisis" and never be able to seize the bright road ahead.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Let us now try to examine the "national crises" that our nation has suffered over the past year, and settle the overall account for the past year, so that we know how severe the blows we have received over the past year have been, and to what extent the national crisis has come.</p>
<p>What we should first examine is, of course, the "foreign troubles." Last year's September 18th Incident, in which Japan forcibly occupied the Northeast, had no more than four motives. (1) Japan attempted to alleviate its domestic revolution with foreign problems. (2) Japan attempted to make the three northeastern provinces a semi-colony and its "exclusive colony" in order to advance its continental policy. (3) It gave the United States' open door opportunity equal treatment with a head-on blow. In other words, it gave the United States resistance to investment in China, so that it would not become Japan's strong rival in East Asia. (4) Obtain the leadership in the East against the Soviet Union. Of course, this fact has a turbulent international political situation as its true driving force, and it is not due to the "aggressive warfare" or "aggressive ambitions" of a few Japanese warlords.</p>
<p>However, the outbreak of the September 18th Disaster was truly a fatal blow to our nation. In terms of land, 3.2627 million square miles, accounting for one-twelfth of our total area, changed its color in no time. In terms of population, 30 million compatriots, accounting for 8% of the national population, fell into the tragic situation of becoming slaves before the country was destroyed. In terms of resources, according to the Manchurian Industry Statistics of the Japanese Kwantung Office in the previous year, the total agricultural products of the three northeastern provinces totaled about 19 million tons, accounting for more than 20% of our national agricultural output. In recent years, the export value of agricultural products from the Northeast has reached about 280 million customs taels, accounting for more than 48% of the total value of our national internal exports of 660 million customs taels. Other developed and undeveloped iron, coal, gold and other mineral products, as well as vast forests and railways, have all been seized by the Japanese. Therefore, the fall of the Northeast means that, if we temporarily put aside the serious crisis in national defense, this kind of economic loss is also a very deep wound to our country. According to the preliminary statistics of the Central Bureau of Statistics, the official losses in the September 18th Incident totaled more than 178 million yuan, and the reports from the two provinces of Jilin and Heilongjiang were incomplete. In fact, it is more than this number. In addition, in recent years, more than two million people have moved from the densely populated areas of our internal provinces to Guanwai (outside the Pass) every year. Since the Japanese forcibly occupied the Northeast and established a puppet regime, they have regarded the people in Shanhaiguan as "foreigners," and they all enjoy closed doors. From then on, in the transplantation of the population, we will also suffer serious blows. The above are the losses suffered by our country in the Northeast Disaster. The two Tianjin riots cost our country another 6 million yuan. According to preliminary official statistics on the outbreak of the January 28th Shanghai War,</p>
<p>Our country's losses were also 160 million yuan. All these blows directly put our nation on the line of life and death, and indirectly gave our social foundation a great shock. However, under this situation, our country initially did not understand the motives of Japan's September 18th invasion and insisted on a policy of non-resistance. Then it trusted the League of Nations and only issued verbal protests, without seeking effective countermeasures. As a result, the puppet state was openly established, and Japan formally recognized it. The report of the League of Nations investigation team was also ambiguous, and the Japanese regarded it as waste paper. Our country wanted to rely on it as a surrender charm, but it was not possible. Therefore, over the past year, the Northeast issue has become more and more difficult, and the diplomatic situation has become more and more dangerous. Although it is said that the turbulent international economic and political situation is its root cause, and there is its "inevitable" trend, we cannot rely on self-reliance to seek self-help and self-salvation, and only trust others and look up to others. We must also admit that those who misled our country are actually ourselves. The above said "foreign troubles." Now please say "internal worries."</p>
<p>Today, we are truly worried about internal worries. Our country's external troubles are indeed urgent today, but internal worries are even more urgent. Moreover, without internal worries, external troubles will never be invited, and even if external troubles come, the whole country will be panicked and unable to cope. Looking around the country, it is full of devastation. Politics cannot get on the right track, the economy is approaching bankruptcy, and people's livelihoods are declining. Crisis lurks everywhere. This is truly a national crisis, and it is truly the most serious and urgent major problem facing our country.</p>
<p>In terms of politics, at this time when external troubles are increasingly urgent, there was first the Guangdong rebellion, then the Shandong rebellion, and recently the conflict between the two Lius in Sichuan. Right and wrong are unclear, prestige is not established, and discipline is not emphasized. What about politics? We have already seen it roughly.</p>
<p>In terms of economy, our country was originally founded on agriculture. Until now, it has not formally stepped into the stage of industrial economy. Moreover, at this time when our country's social economy and national finances are exhausted, what can still be supported is still the ability to cut flesh to heal sores in rural areas. Since last year's nationwide flood, the direct losses and indirect impact have caused the rural economy to fall into a state of total bankruptcy. The young and strong are displaced, the old and weak are displaced, farmland is barren, and agricultural production has been drastically reduced. We only need to look at the import situation for the past year. Its total import value was 1.399 million customs taels (hereinafter referred to as taels), with an import surplus of more than 540 million taels. Among them, cotton goods were more than 14.9 million taels, cotton was more than 130 million taels, rice was more than 12.1 million taels, sugar was more than 8.6 million taels, tobacco and cigarettes were more than 5.6 million taels, flour was more than 3.1 million taels, seafood was more than 2.5 million taels, woolen fabrics were more than 2.4 million taels, fruits and medicines were more than 2.3 million taels, timber was more than 2.3 million taels, rayon was more than 1.4 million taels, wheat was more than 1.2 million taels, and canned food was more than 1.2 million taels. These huge imports are all necessary for daily life, and most of them are agricultural products. From this, we can prove the drastic reduction of our agricultural products and the decline of the rural economy. Even in the first half of this year, the imported goods were 610 million taels, and the import surplus was 380 million taels. The imports in the second half of the year are even stronger, and the number of import surplus will be even more alarming than last year. Since the beginning of the Republic of China, there has been an import surplus every year. As of the 20th year, the import surplus has reached 3.9122 million customs taels, equivalent to more than 600 million yuan of national currency at the current market price. A country founded on agriculture, where the people's daily necessities of food and clothing are dependent on imports, means that we are not talking about the bankruptcy of the agricultural economy and the collapse of the foundation of the country. If a war breaks out in the Pacific Ocean and our ports are blockaded and imports are cut off, how will we survive?</p>
<p>This year, Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and other provinces have had bumper autumn harvests, but they are still unable to save the rural crisis and save the farmers from the fire. There are two reasons for this. One is that after last year's flood, farmers mostly borrowed grain from landlords to maintain their lives. This year's spring plowing, cattle heads and seeds also mostly came from usurious loans. When the autumn harvest came, the landlords manipulated the price of grain and rice. The price of grain in Hunan was only 2.4 yuan per dan, and the price of rice also fell to about 6 yuan. The selling price of new rice in Anhui Province was only 2.2 yuan. The same is true in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Therefore, farmers have to lose several yuan for every mu of land they plant. Although the year is a bumper one, their lives have not improved at all. Secondly, due to the expulsion of war, rural capital has mostly fled to the cities, especially concentrated in Shanghai. As a result, the cities feel a surplus, and the rural economy is becoming more and more difficult to turn around. The price of silver has increased, and the value of agricultural products has fallen even more. Today, the price of grain is already hurting farmers. If the recent rumor of borrowing 50 million yuan worth of surplus wheat from the United States is true, then the price of grain and rice in the future will naturally fall even more under its influence, and it will be even more difficult to improve the rural economy.</p>
<p>In terms of sericulture, the most expensive price of mulberry in May and June this year was only one yuan per dan. Compared with the price of ten yuan for two dan or ten yuan for three dan in the past, the price has fallen by four or five times. In 19 years, there were a total of 251,000 mu of mulberry fields in Wuxi. In 20 years, it was reduced to more than 150,000 mu. This year, it has been drastically reduced to more than 84,000 mu. Since mulberry production is like this, there is no need to ask about the silk industry. In the past, there were more than 500 silk cocoon shops in Wuxi. This year, only 15 shops have opened to collect cocoons. From this one thing, the decline of the silk industry can be seen roughly. Jiangsu is like this, and Zhejiang and other silk-producing areas are also similar.</p>
<p>The situation of agricultural panic is as described above, and the decline of industry is even more serious. After the Shanghai War, although a very small number of industries have improved due to the boycott of Japanese goods, after the Shanghai Incident, labor-capital disputes in Shanghai have emerged one after another, almost every day. From this, we can infer a glimpse of the decline of our country's industry in recent times.</p>
<p>The situation of agricultural panic is like that, and the situation of industrial decline is like this. However, the burden on the people is becoming increasingly heavy. In terms of the issuance of our country's domestic debt, it can be divided into two periods. The era of the rule of the Northern Warlords, from the beginning of the Republic of China to the 15th year, was the first period. The total amount issued was 639.0658 million yuan. The era of the National Government was the second period. From the 16th year to May of last year, the total amount issued was 899 million yuan. This huge amount of debt was directly raised from banks, and indirectly from the people. Its impact on the social economy must also be significant. What is even more serious is that the rural economy is becoming increasingly bankrupt, and the local governments' exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous taxes are becoming increasingly numerous. For example, Tian Songyao's department in Sichuan has levied grain in its occupied areas up to the 34th year of the Republic of China. Deng Xihou's department has also levied up to the 34th year of the Republic of China. Liu Wenhui to the 26th year of the Republic of China, Liu Xiang to the 22nd year of the Republic of China, Zhu Guo Youlian to the 25th year of the Republic of China, Liu Cunhou to the 35th year of the Republic of China. In other places, such as Chen Guohui in Fujian, he collected as many as 43 kinds of exorbitant taxes. New houses are taxed, Taoist and Buddhist monks are taxed, chicken and duck eggs are taxed, and even coffins are taxed, marriages are taxed, and clever names are created to exploit the people. For example, the land tax in Hunan was originally set at three yuan and six cents per tael in the early Republic of China. Now, with the increase of surcharges, each tael has also increased to more than sixteen yuan. Liu Zhennian in Jiaodong "plundered the people's wealth, increased taxes and miscellaneous taxes, and created endless tricks. Each ding of silver was taxed one tael and an additional nine yuan was levied, and it was levied four times a year. The special military tax was increased to thirty-four yuan per tael. The situation of requisitioning supplies in the defense area of ​​the division, which can be verified in the records of each county in the 20th year, totaled more than 5.2069 million yuan. In addition, he used the means of kidnapping, such as the Zhang family in Huang County being kidnapped for 2.5 million yuan, and the Zhang and Lin families in Ye County being kidnapped for 2 million yuan." (See the Lu Han telegrams of the 5th, Jiang Zhang and other telegrams) The above is just an example, but from this example, it can be extended to the whole country, that is, it can be seen the heavy burden and deep suffering of the people, and the accelerated bankruptcy of the social economy.</p>
<p>The government takes so much from the people, and the people bear so much. However, draining the pond to catch fish is not for construction, not for production, but to supply the army's military expenses. According to the statistics of the Geneva Disarmament Conference this year, the British army is 110,000, the United States is 150,000, France is 420,000, Italy is 510,000, and Japan is 276,000, while the number of soldiers raised in our country has reached 1.8 million. Other miscellaneous armies, militias and police are not included. Combined with the above five countries, it is still 310,000 less than our country. More than 80% of the national treasury is used to raise soldiers. Before November of the 20th year, the monthly military expenditure of the armies directly under the Central Government was 25.5 million yuan. The more soldiers are raised, the more endless wars and chaos there are, the deeper the people are poisoned, and the greater the blow to the social economy.</p>
<p>Judging from the above-mentioned phenomena, the "national crisis" of our country has become more and more serious over the past year. National economy and people's livelihood are at stake. We are in today, looking at the past and looking to the future, we are so sad that we have no time to spare. What celebration is there to speak of?</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>Although, the national crisis has reached this point, what is the use of grief? Moreover, in this year, there are also some phenomena that are still satisfactory. For example, the people of the Northeast have automatically risen up to recover the lost land and to fight for the personality of our nation, and have been fighting a long-term hard battle with the Japanese army. Compared with the Northeast compatriots who suffered the trampling of Japan and Russia after the two Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese wars and did not resist, the rise of the volunteer army this time can be taken as a real evidence of the awakening of our nation. And their automatic rise up to relieve their own suffering by their own strength, without relying on others and without hoping for others, recognizes their own strength, and the significance it shows is even greater.</p>
<p>We believe that mere grief is not enough to break the national crisis, and mere appeals are not enough to save the crisis. If we want to break the national crisis, we must give full play to the great power of our entire nation. Therefore, we must have a correct understanding of the exertion of "power," that is, the "power" of a few people is definitely not as good as the "power" of many people. The scattered "power" is not as good as the organized "power." The "power" of empty talk is not as good as the power of action. The passive "power" is not as good as the automatic "power." The "power" of comfort is not as good as the "power" of a great disaster. The "power" of aimless action is not as good as the "power" of recognizing the goal and acting. Being able to grasp the true meaning and value of "power," and then pursuing the way to mobilize this great power, then what are we afraid of the current national crisis?</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "A country without foreign enemies often perishes." Today's multiple national crises can be said to be a summary of our nation's twenty years of following the old ways and living in peace, or it can be said to be a test of our nation's ability to survive, or it can be said to be the driving force for helping the national rejuvenation. There is light ahead. We should only work hard. Today next year, we should all look forward to celebrating and dancing together amidst the arduous struggle of our nation's rebirth in _________.</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese Zheng Luosheng and Others Dissatisfied with the Lytton Report</h3>
<p>Oppose the Six Points Statement</p>
<p>Nanjing: Overseas Chinese Zheng Luosheng, Zhang Yongfu, Fang Zhizhen, and Lin Youren believe that the report of the League of Nations Investigation Commission does not conform to the original intent of the League of Nations Covenant, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which maintain national defense, peace, and safeguard the territorial and administrative sovereignty of our country. On the 8th, they telegraphed the entire country, expressing their absolute opposition to the following points: 1. Establishing an autonomous government in the three northeastern provinces. 2. The so-called advisory council. 3. Extending residential and land lease rights throughout the three northeastern provinces under consular jurisdiction. 4. Employing Japanese advisors with broad authority similar to a governor-general. 5. Japan has the right to take any measures if the three northeastern provinces are attacked by a third party. 6. The Twenty-One Demands and any other illegal agreements coerced and privately concluded without legal procedures. They also declared the following points: 1. Absolutely no guarantee that the movement to boycott Japanese goods based on the freedom of the people will not occur again. 2. Absolutely no direct negotiations with Japan until the puppet state is destroyed and the three northeastern provinces are restored. 3. The instability of the Chinese political situation is the evil result of Japanese-backed bandits and warlords deliberately creating internal chaos in China. 4. Japan's forceful seizure of Manchuria is a manifestation of its traditional imperialism, and the responsibility lies entirely with Japan. 5. The ambition and viciousness of Japanese militarists are such that they want to conquer the world, and there is absolutely no possibility of amity. 6. Japan's rights in China have only been increased and seized, with no losses whatsoever. What it has seized is fixed, not temporary. In conclusion, they stated that national subjugation is worse than the destruction of one's home, and reputation is more important than life. They would rather be remembered for generations like Yue Fei, Qi Jiguang, Shi Kefa, An Jung-geun, Cai Tingkai, Lee Bong-chang, and Yun Bong-gil, rather than be reviled for eternity like Qin Hui, Hong Chengchou, Wu Sangui, Lee Wan-yong, Zheng Xiaoxu, Xie Jieshi, Zhao Xinbo. On one hand, they would assist the Northeast anti-Japanese armies, and on the other hand, they would send troops to punish the puppet state, contributing wealth and sacrificing their lives, each doing their best, with one heart and one mind, sharing the same hatred.

<h3>British Newspaper Reports France Refuses to Form Alliance with Japan</h3>
<p>But French Officials Say They Have Not Heard of Japan Ever Making Such a Proposal</p>
<p>Debate Arises Over Whether the Franco-Japanese Treaty is Valid</p>
<p>France Will Remain Neutral if Russia and Japan Collide</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 9th: According to The Sunday Times, the Japanese government proposed a formal alliance to France several weeks ago. The French Foreign Ministry carefully considered and studied this proposal. A certain veteran French diplomat with great knowledge and experience of Far Eastern affairs strongly expressed the opinion that accepting such a proposal would be dishonorable. France therefore abandoned the idea of accepting it, as concluding such an alliance while the Lytton Commission was investigating the Far Eastern Incident would be a breach of faith towards other countries concerned.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Paris, 9th: French officials are unaware of reports that the Japanese government proposed an alliance with France. They stated that such a proposal is unlikely to have been made.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 9th: The diplomatic correspondent of The Sunday Times reports that there is considerable debate behind the scenes in France and elsewhere regarding the validity of the Franco-Japanese Treaty of June 10, 1907, especially regarding the exchange of letters concerning this treaty. The treaty and exchange of letters bind France and Japan to respect the independence and integrity of China, while recognizing each other's spheres of influence in China. France's sphere of influence is the three southern provinces of China, while Japan's rights are located in Fujian, the three northeastern provinces, and Mongolia. The current debate revolves around whether the treaty and exchange of letters have been invalidated by Article 21 of the League of Nations Covenant. ▲According to the Tokyo Jiji Shinpo, negotiations on the Russo-French non-aggression treaty, which were informally initialed last year, were suspended for a time. Recently, the two countries resumed negotiations, and the agreement is scheduled to be formally signed in Geneva this week. The agreement remains the same as the draft agreement of last year and serves as a guideline for closer Russo-French trade relations. It stipulates four items: (1) Both France and Russia shall respect non-aggressive warfare against each other; (2) If one of the two countries is attacked by a third country, the other country shall remain strictly neutral; (3) In the event of a conflict between Russia and Japan in Manchuria, France cannot intervene due to the Franco-Japanese Treaty, and must remain strictly neutral to protect Russia.</p>
<h3>US Expresses Surprise at Report Stating it Initiated the 1918 Intervention in Northern Manchuria</h3>
<p>▲Guomin News Agency, Washington, 8th: Officials in the US Department of State today expressed great surprise after discovering that the Lytton Report stated that the United States initiated the Allied intervention in Siberia in 1918. The report stated, when describing the situation in Northern Manchuria, that when various countries exchanged official documents to discuss the crisis in Siberia and Allied interests, the United States proposed intervention. However, US State Department officials only expressed surprise and did not wish to comment. When asked for clarification, they presented government records, which show that according to official documents exchanged between the United States and various European countries between January and July 1918, the intervention in Siberia was proposed by the Allies, and the United States initially did not want to participate, but finally agreed to join.</p>
<h3>Gu Weijun Visits French Minister of the Army to Discuss Report's Views</h3>

Although Gu did not express the official views of the Chinese government on the Lytton Report, he told Penko that the general opinion of the Chinese government and the press is not unfavorable towards the Lytton Report.</p>
<h3>Japanese Opinion Paper Being Drafted</h3>
<p>▲Japanese League News Agency, Tokyo, 9th: A joint meeting of the Foreign, Army, and Navy Ministries deliberated on the fundamental guidelines for producing the Japanese government's opinion paper on the 7th. It was decided to uphold Japan's consistently stated position. The Asian Bureau of the Foreign Ministry is now drafting the paper under the direction of Director Tani. The Japanese opinion paper can be completed approximately before the 20th of this month, and Matsuoka Yosuke will take it to Geneva and submit it to the League of Nations. It is said that its contents are generally as follows: (1) The opinion paper aims to have various countries understand Japan's position. The full text is thousands of pages long. (2) It will thoroughly refute the Lytton Report. (3) Although Lytton views China as a country without control, the opinion paper will list numerous facts to reinforce this point. (4) It will explain that the League of Nations is incapable of eradicating China's anti-Japanese goods movement. (5) It will explain that Japan's military actions were purely for self-defense. (6) It will point out that "Manchukuo" was indeed established by the free will of the residents and cite numerous historical precedents. (7) It will assert that the League of Nations should not interfere in the resolution of Sino-Japanese issues.</p>
<h3>The Only Virtue of the Chinese People</h3>

<h3>Following Germany, the French Government Accepts the London Invitation</h3>
<p>Advocates for Relocating the Conference Venue to Geneva</p>
<p>New Disarmament Plan Still Under Consideration</p>
<p>Herriot and Henderson Engage in Cordial Conversation</p>
<p>American Representative Mediates Between Britain and France</p>
<p>▲ Guomin News Agency, Paris, 8th: France's response to the London Five-Power Conference has been delivered to the British government this morning. According to semi-official sources, the French government, in principle, accepts the suggestion put forth by those in favor of new efforts aimed at eliminating the divergent views of the major powers on disarmament. However, it indicates that the location is still a matter for discussion, suggesting further deliberations. However, political circles here imply that the location issue may be resolved during the Anglo-French preparatory meetings. Today, the evening newspapers here are cautious in their commentary on the outcome of this British proposal, merely stating that the current state of the conference is largely due to the mediation efforts of the American representative. The interest in this conference has been diminished by the new French disarmament plan, which was drafted by French Minister of War Piétonne, together with Czech Foreign Minister Beneš and Greek Representative Politis, and is currently under consideration by French Prime Minister Herriot. It is expected to be submitted to the cabinet for discussion within the next week. There are various rumors circulating about its content, but what is known for certain, according to the creators themselves, is that this plan represents a new attempt to establish a constructive link between disarmament and security. It is also rumored to be divided into two parts. The first part guarantees the maximum security of European countries, allowing for significant disarmament. The second part outlines the maximum reduction of armaments that would not affect France's security. Another report claims that the first part stipulates that Germany must provide a solemn guarantee to renounce its demands for revising its eastern borders for a certain period, approximately twenty years.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 8th: British officials consider the French response that has now been received to be satisfactory, as the differences revealed in the response should not be difficult to reconcile. Germany's expressed willingness should be manageable, and France's desire to have Geneva as the conference venue is not an insurmountable obstacle. According to Berlin sources, the German government is awaiting a new invitation to the Five-Power Conference. Meanwhile, the German Chargé d'Affaires in Britain has been instructed to orally explain Germany's brief response to the British government in order to mediate, stating that it does not contain any difficult conditions.</p>
<p>▲ Havas News Agency, London, 8th: American representative to the Disarmament Conference, Davis, has come to London before the Disarmament Conference has made a full discussion, to discuss naval disarmament issues with British authorities. He will meet with British Foreign Secretary Simon next week. As approved at the Disarmament Conference in Geneva in July of this year, a resolution was passed urging major naval powers to hold negotiations outside the conference. Davis's trip to London is based on this. The respective positions of Britain and the United States are based on the naval treaty signed in London on April 22, 1930. Japan also signed this treaty, and its clauses have not been modified to this day.  ▲ Havas News Agency, Paris, 8th: Chairman of the Disarmament Conference Henderson spoke with Herriot for an hour at 7 p.m. After Mr. Henderson left, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs released the following message: "Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Herriot recently met with Chairman of the Disarmament Conference Henderson and studied the various issues to be included on the agenda of the next meeting of the Presidium of the Disarmament Conference, in order to ensure the smooth progress of the already underway business."</p>
<p>▲ Havas News Agency, Paris, 8th: Herriot and Henderson met very cordially, as can be seen from their expressions during the conversation. When a photographer tried to take a picture of the two, the magnesium flash failed to ignite. Henderson joked to Herriot, "Your gunpowder is damp!" Mr. Henderson often carries a miniature cruiser in his pocket to show Mr. Herriot, and solemnly said, "In my opinion, no weaponry should exceed this size."</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>A Bird's-Eye View of the Tragic Situation in the Northeast</h3>
<p>▲ The People Have High Hopes for Government Assistance</p>
<p>▲ Japanese Aircraft Drop Bombs and Burn Villages</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The fall of the Northeast has exceeded one year. The government's hopes for the League of Nations are pinned on the recently published investigation report. The government should be soberly aware. The current situation in the Northeast is a major concern for the people of the country. Recently, a Westerner who has worked in the transportation sector in Fengning for many years came to Tianjin. The reporter interviewed him at his residence. The Westerner provided an honest account from a third-party perspective. His words are worthy of study, and the reader is encouraged to pay attention. The Westerner's remarks are as follows: On the night of the September 18th Incident last year, Commander-in-Chief Honjo Shigeru of the Kwantung Army had not anticipated that the Japanese garrison in Shenyang's military actions would lead to the current situation. His initial intention was merely to occupy Shenyang and use force to compel the Chinese government to acknowledge Japan's vested interests in the Northeast. However, the Chinese troops retreated repeatedly, and the Chinese government was unable to unite and save itself, which led to the establishment of the puppet state of Manchuria. Turning the pages of world history, one has never seen a complete territory being invaded without resistance and such weakness as China's. Therefore, Europeans and Americans who have never been to China are surprised and shocked to hear of it.</p>
<p>I (the Westerner referring to himself, hereinafter the same) have worked in the Northeast for over ten years and am very familiar with the situation outside the customs. Not all those currently serving in the puppet state are traitors who seek personal gain by selling out the country. To my knowledge, several have been threatened into serving as puppets. If they refuse, not only will their property be confiscated, but their lives will be in danger. Several are serving the enemy while remaining loyal to China, hoping that the Chinese government will have a solution and that the army will one day return. Therefore, they endure humiliation and surrender to occupy a position to prevent the government from falling entirely into the hands of the Japanese. However, time has passed for over a year. The Chinese army is standing idly by in the Northeast, and the government has no solution. These patriotic individuals who endure humiliation and surrender to the enemy are unable to act freely, as if they are in prison. When I left Shenyang, I went to say goodbye to a group of friends. An old gentleman, who was once a high-ranking official and is now a dignitary, was disheveled and unkempt, having not bathed or groomed himself for months. He grasped my hand tightly and sobbed, saying, "Mr. [應爲囗囗], I have surrendered to the enemy, but my heart will never surrender. I have endured humiliation until now, and I fear that my efforts will not be appreciated by the Chinese people, and I am powerless to save the people of the Northeast. Now I am old, sick, and about to die. You are leaving, and I fear I will never see you again. I only hope that you will tell the Chinese government to quickly unite and fight against the enemy. If they can take action now, it can still be salvaged. If they continue to delay, the puppet state will become deeply entrenched, making it even more difficult to deal with." At this point, he wept uncontrollably, and I also left with tears in my eyes. Today, I still miss my old friend, who must still be brooding with grief.</p>
<p>Among those serving in the puppet state in second- and third-tier roles, three-fifths are forced by livelihood, one-fifth are threatened, and one-fifth have no principles. Those who truly wish for the Northeast to fall and willingly serve the puppet state, like Zhao Xinbo, (Xie Jieshi is Taiwanese) are rare. As for the more than 30 million people in the Northeast, I dare to assert that not a single one supports the puppet state of Manchuria. There are two things that can prove this: (1) Workers on the Guandong section of the Beining Railway were unwilling to work for the puppet state. Within two months of the establishment of the Fengshan Railway, no fewer than 3,000 workers abandoned their posts and entered the customs. Later, they were monitored by Japanese soldiers, and those who were caught deserting along the way were executed using extremely cruel methods. After that, no one dared to escape again. (2) When the puppet state took over the postal service, the Chinese Ministry of Communications instructed all employees in the Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang postal districts to return to the customs. Within a week of receiving the instruction, more than 1,380 of the more than 1,400 employees in the Liaoning postal district entered the customs. The remaining 20 were not unwilling to enter the customs, but were being monitored by the Japanese and could not escape. Furthermore, the postal workers were all local residents, and their monthly wages were limited. If they were transferred to the customs during peacetime, they would demand family support funds and pay raises. Otherwise, they would refuse the transfer by striking. Today, even with offers of pay raises and promotions, they unanimously turned a deaf ear and willingly left their homes, abandoned their wives and children, and entered the customs alone. This shows that the people's patriotic sentiments are more important than their own lives and families.</p>
<p>There are many former soldiers outside the customs. Their weapons are mostly Type 38 rifles. After the September 18th Incident, the regular army did not resist and retreated. The bandits, such as Xiaobailong and Laobeifeng, were the first to raise the banner of resistance against Japan. Other small groups also rose up to make trouble for the Japanese army. Huang Xiansheng, a general from the Northeast, wanted to lead and unite to form an anti-Japanese army, called the Volunteer Army, and commissioned more than 20 commanders, mostly bandit leaders. Unfortunately, Huang only issued appointment letters and did not provide any supplies. In the first few months, they mainly operated along the railway line. The Japanese army was furious and sent aircraft to drop bombs and burn villages along the line, forcing homeless farmers to form groups with their self-defense weapons to raise the banner of resistance against Japan and seek food in villages slightly farther from the railway line. If they did not do so, they would be sitting ducks. From summer to autumn, under the cover of the green gauze curtains, small groups of the Volunteer Army occasionally appeared on the railway line, destroying roads and looting trains. After the Mid-Autumn Festival, after the autumn harvest, there were no traces of the Volunteer Army within 20 to 30 miles of the railway line. Although the Japanese army hated the Volunteer Army, they did not dare to station troops far beyond the railway line. However, in remote villages that the Japanese army's iron hooves did not reach, the Volunteer Army, without anyone to provide for them, was forced to go and ask for food and drink. Not only that, but since the Japanese army was determined to eliminate the Volunteer Army, after the sorghum harvest was completed, they sent aircraft every day to scout out remote villages and towns. Knowing that the Volunteer Army had no anti-aircraft guns, they often flew extremely low. The cattle and sheep in the countryside would run in fright at the sound. Farmers, fearing that their cattle and sheep would be lost, would grab sticks and chase after them. The Japanese army would then mistake them for fleeing Volunteer Army soldiers and strafe them with machine guns, then drop bombs and burn the villages. The scope of the bombing became wider and wider, and the number of unemployed farmers also increased day by day. In the blink of an eye, winter arrived, and countless tens of thousands died of hunger and cold without a home.</p>
<p>In the major stations and cities between Shenyang and Changchun, the Japanese installed countless loudspeakers to receive broadcasts of news from within the customs from central or Shanghai and Hangzhou radio stations. People inside the customs may hear this and find it difficult to distinguish between truth and falsehood, which is insignificant. But people outside the customs can't help but laugh. For example, on a certain day, the Volunteer Army attacked Shenyang, on a certain day they attacked Huanggu Tun, on another day they occupied Goubangzi and forced Jinzhou, and on another day they surrounded Changchun and recovered Jilin. These are all fabricated stories. To my knowledge, the fortifications built by the Japanese army in Shenyang, Changchun, Jilin and other places are extremely tight and seem difficult to break into. However, from spring to autumn, each railway has been repeatedly destroyed, which is a fact. The Fushun coal mine was attacked by the Volunteer Army, resulting in losses of about 500,000 to 600,000 yuan, which is also true. The report inside the customs that the Volunteer Army once attacked Shenyang City and burned down the airfield does not entirely correspond to the facts. I want to describe the truth of this matter, but I also need to add a section on the social situation in the puppet state. Originally, the puppet state was established not long ago, and whether there are laws, I, as an outsider, cannot know. However, since the September 18th Incident last year, the area outside the customs has fallen into a state of anarchy without laws. Anything prohibited by Chinese law was openly allowed during this period. With regard to food-related matters, opium, morphine, golden pills, white powder, red pills, white pills, and "three major exchanges" are all available everywhere. With regard to gambling-related matters, mahjong, pai gow, yao tan, fan tan, lottery, poker, and "thirty-six doors" are available in abundance. Local military police collect "leaky regulations" and do not interfere with the ban, so Su Bingwen's telegram protesting against the rebellion stated, "A certain gendarme has accumulated wealth of over ten thousand," which is true. On the afternoon of August 28, several "red sleeves" (the uniform of the puppet state's public security guerrillas is the same as that of the Japanese soldiers, but with an "A"-shaped red armband, which the locals call "red sleeves") were watching Koreans gambling on the street, but a gambler shouted abusive words such as "Malu, Chinese slaves of a fallen country." The "red sleeves" retaliated with abusive words, resulting in a tragic械鬭 conflict. Japanese soldiers arrived after hearing the news and arrested all the perpetrators. The Koreans were soon released, while the "red sleeves" were subjected to torture. The sound of wailing in pain reached outside in the middle of the night. The next morning, they were executed by copper鍘. Therefore, the "red sleeves" were greatly angered and secretly planned a means of revenge, and contacted the Volunteer Army nearby to agree on an attack on the city, with the "red sleeves" willing to cooperate from the inside. Unexpectedly, the "red sleeves" had already been launched on the due date, but the Volunteer Army was blocked by the Japanese army outside the city and failed to arrive as scheduled. These more than 500 "red sleeves" did not dare to stay for long and rushed to the airfield, shooting Japanese and Koreans they encountered on the way. After arriving at the airfield, they set fire to the warehouse, destroying seven or eight old airplanes left by Zhang Xueliang. The "red sleeves" wanted to rush to the arsenal to rob weapons and ammunition, but due to the precautions, they retreated to the Shenhai Road. In this battle, more than 200 Japanese, Koreans, and Japanese soldiers were killed and injured, and the "red sleeves" also suffered significant losses.</p>
<p>There is no precise statistic on the total number of Volunteer Army soldiers, but it is approximately 500,000 to 600,000, most of whom have not received military training. The area outside the customs is vast. The Japanese had previously planned to encircle and suppress the area by dividing it into districts, but if it were implemented simultaneously in three provinces, it would not be enough to allocate less than 300,000 to 400,000 troops. The Japanese army thought that mobilizing 300,000 to 400,000 troops would not only be too costly, but would also damage the reputation of the Japanese army. Therefore, they changed their approach and used heavy money to appease them. Therefore, those with weak wills changed their loyalty and served the enemy. Therefore, Yu Zhishan, Yu Shen, and Zhang Haipeng were asked to surrender, and as a result of the appeasement, each had 20,000 to 30,000 troops. The people outside the customs are waiting for the central government to have a solution, and the people inside the customs are waiting for the Volunteer Army to have a solution. In fact, the government has no solution, and it is even more difficult for the Volunteer Army to have a solution alone. Furthermore, a group of speculators, under the pretext of the Volunteer Army's anti-Japanese reputation, are soliciting donations from inside the customs. In addition, Ma Zhanshan is the most powerful group to resist Japan. If the central government can find a way to provide assistance to them, then with rest and replenishment, their strength should not be underestimated.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>Recently, Su Bingwen, the commander of the Harbin-Manchuria Railway Protection Force, suddenly raised the banner of rebellion, which is also the most powerful group to resist Japan. Mr. Su originally had only two infantry brigades and eight independent companies. After the telegram was sent out, it was expanded to six brigades, and many Volunteer Army soldiers returned after hearing the news, with a force of about 30,000 troops. The transportation is advantageous, and both sides are suitable. It can advance and attack, retreat and defend. In the future, when it is contacted with Ma Zhanshan's army, it will not be very difficult to recover Heilongjiang Province. However, the central government must also have a whole plan. Otherwise, even if the Su and Ma armies can jointly recover Heilongjiang Province, it will be difficult to sustain it.</p>
<p>In conclusion, if you want to save the Northeast, you must set your principles, make up your mind, unite, and go to the national crisis together. Otherwise, you should accept the compromise plan of the League of Nations investigation team, and then strive to strengthen yourself. I have a word to advise the Chinese people: "Strive to strengthen yourself." If you cannot strengthen yourself, even if Japan does not perish the Northeast, Russia will perish the Northeast. I am not Chinese, but seeing the tragic situation of the Japanese army's iron hooves trampling on the Northeast, my heart is very sad and angry. (October 7)</p>

Whenever the inspection team arrives in a place, the police and soldiers of the county and city must provide effective protection, but each county must not notify the county magistrate in advance, and must not accept any form of entertainment or supply. When inspecting various political affairs in the county and district, the county magistrate may be asked to assist and consult various documents and books when necessary. The scope of matters to be inspected and reported is roughly as follows: (1) The actual organization of each county government and the number of expenditures. (2) Local order and public security, factional infighting, actions of bandits and communists, the situation of county governments in handling guards, and anti-bandit work. (3) Whether the personnel of each county and its subordinate agencies can be loyal and diligent in handling affairs, abide by the law, and whether there is any corruption, bribery, etc. (4) The personal morals, ability to handle affairs, and public criticism of the county magistrates. (5) Whether the personnel of each county government can abide by party doctrine and party programs, and whether they can cooperate with local party departments and the public. (6) The status of education, culture, and local autonomy in the county. (7) The status of construction matters in the county, such as roads, telephones, shipping, afforestation, water conservancy, and reclamation. (8) The type and quantity of local products, and the situation of agriculture, industry, commerce, fisheries, and mining. (9) The type and equipment of local charitable and relief undertakings. (10) The structure and management of county prisons or detention centers. (11) The municipal administration of county cities and towns. (12) The number of local revenue and expenditure, and its sources and uses. Whether there have been any recent violations of regulations, absenteeism, etc. by county officials. However, if the inspection team has any of the following behaviors, it will be investigated and punished accordingly: 1. Assisting county magistrates to deliberately conceal or make false reports. 2. Failing to abide by the regulations and neglecting their duties. 3. Engaging in intimidation and forming cliques. (October 5)</p>
<h3>Western Journey (3)(16)</h3>
<p>▲Yellow Sand Blows in the Face, the Return Journey is Difficult</p>
<p>Dali was our last survey area. As soon as our horse tracks and traces entered the county seat, it was just like Tang Sanzang's pilgrimage to the West. The Western Paradise was reached, and the task was almost complete. On the night of the 14th, because the country was in trouble and I was responsible, I did not dare to stay in Shaanxi for long. I decided to leave for Tongguan on the morning of the 15th and return east, while other comrades would go to Xi'an or other places within a day or two to draft reports. Within a week, there was still the pain of "I can't go, brother."</p>
<p>From Dali to Tongguan is about ninety miles. Originally, there were long-distance buses that could pass, but they were recently suspended due to an incident. Ma Xiaozhong and Zhao Yuru of the Provincial Government asked the county government for a car on the evening of the 14th, but no car was available, so the result was zero. I was at a loss. I privately calculated that if I set off by rickshaw at 5:00 am on the 15th, and traveled at least ten miles per hour, I could reach Tongguan around 2:00 pm and catch the 3:00 pm train to Shanzhou in the east. However, Liu Jun and others of the Longhai Railway had purchased four horses along the way, so the later journey gradually improved. It was possible to travel without animal power. Since the horse carts were decided to be dismissed, and the horses would be a burden if they traveled with the car, there must be a solution. For the convenience of both parties, instead of riding a rickshaw slowly, it would be better for me and two servants to ride three horses, and use another horse to carry luggage, and travel east together. After arriving in Tongguan, I would continue my journey, while the horses would be left in Tongguan. At the time, I thought this method was also very appropriate and expressed my agreement.</p>
<p>At half past four on the 15th, the sky was not yet bright. I got up immediately and took a lamp to the courtyard to wash. Thirty minutes later, when I was about to leave the crowd quietly and sadly, Mr. Li Yongzhen suddenly woke up from a dream in bed. He stretched out a jade arm from the warm quilt and shook my hand. Mr. Huang Boda and Mr. Wei, not afraid of the cold air of the early morning, each put on their clothes and got up. After watching me get on the horse with four eyes, they slowly returned to the room. On the one hand, I felt the enthusiasm was touching, on the other hand, at the moment of parting, I thought of the hardships and difficulties we had shared in the past month. Once separated, we would be in different places, and it would be difficult to see each other. Naturally, I couldn't help but feel a little sad.</p>
<p>After everyone set off, the god of bad luck constantly suppressed us. Before we had traveled two or three miles, one of the four horses walked very slowly. When whipped, it bent its limbs and lay on the ground, refusing to get up. The speed of travel was greatly reduced. Later, because I had to catch the train that day, I had to let it fall behind and ignore it. At the same time, the horse carrying luggage could not walk continuously because the objects on both sides swayed when walking. I was very anxious at the time. When I arrived at Chaoyi County at eight o'clock, I had no other choice but to return to my original plan and switch to a rickshaw. Unexpectedly, after leaving the city, the east wind blowing in our faces became stronger and stronger. Yellow sand rose from the ground, and both people and horses had difficulty walking. It didn't take much time to cross the Luoshui River at nine o'clock. At half past ten, we arrived at the Wei River. The wind was strong and the waves were high, and the ferry was very dilapidated and clumsy. Yellow sand blew in our faces, making the work difficult. It took about fifty minutes to reach the other shore. When I looked at the watch, it was already half past eleven. There were still thirty-five miles to Tongguan. After reaching the shore, the wind became stronger. The horse was afraid of the headwind. It only moved after each whip. The rickshaw pullers also resigned because they were exhausted and replaced by new ones. After fighting against the strong wind and sand for a long time, we finally reached Tongguan Railway Station at about half past two in the afternoon. We were warmly received by Station Master Lin Rixin. At three o'clock, we took the train to Shaanxi. The suffering of being covered in dust was over for a while.</p>
<p>When I arrived in Shanzhou at nine o'clock that night, Acting Station Master Wang Yuebo also came to greet me after hearing the news. He was a Muslim believer. He wanted to find a solution to the ideological, customary, and other barriers between the Hui and Han people. At midnight, I changed to a special express train to Zhengzhou. When I woke up, the sky was already bright, and the train had arrived in Luoyang. In the train, I had a long talk with Mr. Hong Guantao, Deputy Chief Engineer of the Tongxi Section. Around ten o'clock, we unknowingly arrived in Zhengzhou. The train stopped, and Ms. Qian Zongze (Director of the Longhai Railway Bureau) and Section Chief Liu Wenbin, the mother of our survey team, and others boarded the train to welcome us. In the evening, they held a dust-washing banquet for me at the Longhai Hospital and frequently expressed their condolences. I thought that the small hardships we had suffered this time were a small part of the obligations that a citizen should fulfill. It was not worth mentioning labor or hardship. It was so shameful to receive preferential treatment from others without any merit.</p>
<p>From this, I returned to my homeland and resumed all my previous work in the shortest possible time. (The End)</p>
<h3>The Focus of Bandit Suppression Shifts to Jiangxi</h3>
<p>▲Recent Situation of Various Bandit Groups in Jiangxi</p>
<p>Nanchang Communication: Zhu, Mao, and Peng's groups, after collapsing in Yile, concentrated their main forces in the Guangchang-Ningdu area. According to refugees who escaped from Ruijin, in order to replenish casualties, the Red Bandits have been forcing people to become bandits in Yudu, Xingguo, Ganxian, Yongfeng, Huichang, Xunwu, Ruijin, Shicheng, Guangchang, and other counties. One out of three men and three out of five men are drafted. The Ganxian puppet Soviet government needs to conscript 6,000 strong men. The village and township Soviets are investigating and dispatching them from house to house, and the demand is very urgent. If they are not satisfied, they will be killed. Farmers everywhere, because there is no escape, those who have been conscripted can only bow their heads and be sacrificed. At the same time, a large number of farmers are being recruited to build solid fortifications in Zhaoxie, on the border between Yihuang and Le'an, Kuzhu and Ganzhu, on the border between Guangchang and Nanfeng, and in Zengshao, Luokou, Wangpi, and Xiaopu, where Ningdu intersects with Nanfeng, Le'an, and Guangchang, to prevent the National Army from suppressing them. According to news from Nanfeng, Zhu, Mao, Peng's puppet First, Third, Fifth, and other army corps are using Zhaoxie, Wangpi, and Tengtian as bases, concentrating bandits in Guangchang and Ningdu, and planning to attack Nanfeng again, while another part is containing the National Army in Yihuang and Le'an. After Nanfeng is captured, they will harass Nancheng and spy on Fuzhou. Regardless of whether this news is just propaganda by the Red Bandits, it cannot be ignored. Therefore, the National Army's Mao, Xu, and Li divisions have also built defensive fortifications in Nanfeng towards Guangchang to prevent bandit attacks. As for Kong Helong's group, after being defeated in southern Hubei, they fled along the border of Jiangxi and Hunan into Tonggu and Wanzai in northern Jiangxi. They were severely damaged by Tan Daoyuan and Zhu Yaohua, together with Tao Guang's Hunan Army, at Henglu Bridge and Zhajin. Kong's bandits then fled from Wanzai into the Yuan River basin in Yichun and Fenyi in western Jiangxi. A small part of the bandits recently infiltrated Shanggao and kidnapped the county magistrate, while the majority, about six to seven thousand people, fiercely attacked Jinrui in Yichun in an attempt to open up transportation between western and northern Jiangxi and unite with the bandits in Yongxin, Anfu, Xiajiang, and Lianhua. Fortunately, Zhu Shi's Yi Brigade defeated them and prevented them from succeeding. Currently, Kong's bandits, in addition to using the puppet Third Division to defend the puppet arsenals and rear hospitals in Longgang, Tongshan, and Jiugong Mountain, their puppet Ninth Division and Independent First and Second Divisions are making every effort to harass the Yuan River and western Jiangxi in Wanzai. As for Shao in northeastern Jiangxi, taking advantage of the northward invasion of Zhu, Mao, and Peng's groups, they also harassed Dongxiang and Zixi. Since the National Army recovered Yile, Zhou Hunyuan and other troops have been transferred back to Guixi in northeastern Jiangxi, and together with Zhao Guantao, Li Yunheng, and other divisions, they are encircling and suppressing Fang's bandits from all sides. The bandit dens in Zhoufang and Fulin north of the Xin River have also been destroyed by Li's division. Fang's bandits have gradually moved from the north bank of the Xin River to the south bank, and then fled from Shangrao, Guangfeng, and Qianshan into the border areas of northern Fujian and western Zhejiang. Since the capture of Pucheng, the authorities in Fujian and Zhejiang have paid great attention and have sent Dai Yue, Zhu Mingtao, Zhou Zhiqun, and other troops to suppress them. According to news from eastern Jiangxi, Fang's bandits, finding this road impassable, have fled back to eastern Jiangxi, using the Xin River basin as their lair. In addition, the scattered bandits in eastern Hunan and Guangdong, after being searched and suppressed by the Hunan Army, the remnants of Peng's bandits in Guidong have fled to Zuo'an and Dafen in Chongyi, Shangyou, and Suichuan. The puppet First Division of Li Tianzhu in Qixian and Chaling is hiding in Yongxin, Ninggang, and Lianhua. In short, now,</p>
<p>The bandits in Hunan, Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Hubei all regard Jiangxi Province as their lair, Zhu and Mao as their support, and Ruijin as the nest where all factions converge. Therefore, the focus of bandit suppression in the future will completely shift to Jiangxi. (October 3)</p>
<h3>Opening of the Hunan National Products Exhibition Hall</h3>
<p>Changsha Communication: The Hunan Provincial National Products Exhibition Hall, since its preparation and construction, has been operating for four years and has cost more than 200,000 yuan. Although it has been interrupted several times due to turmoil, it was officially opened on the 1st of this month. The building of the hall is divided into seven floors. The first floor is a national products shopping mall, with a wide variety of goods and is quite perfect. The second floor is also a shopping mall. The third floor is a national products exhibition hall. The fourth floor displays various specimens and instruments. The fifth and sixth floors are both recreation rooms for shop assistants. The seventh floor is the highest peak of the hall and is equipped with a radio receiving station. Its magnificent architecture is considered the best in Hunan Province. At 8:00 am on the 1st, the opening ceremony was held. Chairman He, Directors Cao, Zhang, Tan, and Zhu, Commissioners Huang and Wu, Secretary-General Yi, members of the Provincial Party Department, and representatives of various agencies and public organizations, totaling several hundred people, attended the ceremony. First, Director Liu Tingfang reported on the preparation process, followed by a speech by He Jian, who said that the most difficult thing in China now is the poverty of the country and the backwardness of the economy. In the past one or two decades, the economic situation in China cannot be explained in a few simple words. Just looking at the quantity of goods exported and imported in the customs report can clearly explain the reasons for our country's poverty and economic backwardness. According to the customs report in 1919, when the situation was calm, the import surplus reached more than 160 million taels. By 1931, the import surplus suddenly increased to more than 550 million taels. Statistics show that the money flowing out due to the import surplus in the past 20 years was more than 391.12 million taels, equivalent to more than 600 million yuan in national currency. How can the country not be poor, and how can the economy not be backward? Now, if we don't want to save poverty and save the country, then so be it. If we want to save poverty and save the country, there are only two methods: (1) Develop international trade; (2) Promote national products. Hunan has suffered frequent disasters in recent years, and its vitality has been greatly damaged. At this time of the most intense anti-Japanese and bandit suppression, it is especially necessary to actively promote national products in order to enrich the rural economy, restore vitality after the disaster, and truly resist Japan and suppress bandits in order to save the poor and weak country. However, if we want everyone not to buy foreign goods, we must first let everyone know and recognize that there are replaceable national products. Therefore, although the Hunan Provincial Government is in a very difficult financial situation, it is still determined to complete the national products exhibition hall, which is to collect all national products for display and visit, so that everyone can recognize national products and promote national products. Now that the National Products Exhibition Hall has officially opened, the following two points should be paid attention to in the future: (1) I hope that people throughout the province will unanimously maintain the hall and strive to make national products develop day by day. The staff in the hall should work harder to achieve the government's goal of establishing the hall. (2) Hunan merchants have always had patriotic enthusiasm. In the past, they handled foreign goods, or they suffered from not knowing about national products. Now that the National Products Hall has opened, there are many national product specimens on display. In the future, they can find out the source of national products and the needs of Hunan society, and from now on, they will no longer buy foreign goods and specialize in national products. One more point to pay attention to is not to have foreign goods mixed in and pretend to be national products. The staff in the hall should be responsible for strict inspection. If any is found, they should be severely punished. Then, Zhang, the Director of Finance, and others delivered speeches one after another. Finally, Director Liu gave a reply and took a photo before dispersing. (2nd)</p>
<h3>Anhui Provincial Government Prepares to Establish a County in Jinjiazhai</h3>
<p>Anqing Communication: Jinjiazhai, which belongs to Liuan County in western Anhui, since it was recovered by the National Army's Wei Lihuang, Chairman Chiang has proposed to establish a county there and intended to name it Lihuang County in commemoration. Chiang believes that Jinjiazhai has been the lair of Red Bandits in the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui in recent years, and the local area is dilapidated and almost destroyed. For the convenience of governance, it is planned to establish a county there and subordinate it to Henan Province. However, the Anhui Provincial Department of Civil Affairs believes that the area has always belonged to Anhui Province and should follow the old rules and still be governed by Anhui. It was specially submitted to the Provincial Government's Standing Committee meeting on the 4th and resolved to send personnel to prepare for the establishment of the county first. Eight items were proposed for the establishment of the county and were also approved by the Standing Committee meeting on the same day and will be submitted to the Ministry of Interior for record. As for the candidates for the preparatory committee, it is said that Jiang Yi, a consultant of the Provincial Government, has been internally appointed. Jiang has recently been appointed by the Provincial Government as a special commissioner for handling post-war affairs with the army in western Anhui and is currently stationed in the area. The following is a record of the items proposed by the Department of Civil Affairs for the establishment of Jinjiazhai County: (1) According to the plan submitted by Liao Pu and others, citizens of Henan and Anhui provinces, to establish Jinjiazhai County, in accordance with the regulations on the demarcation of provinces, cities, and counties, the boundary lines should be discussed and agreed upon with the chief magistrates of Liuan County, Huoshan, Huoqiu, and Gushi and Shangcheng counties in Henan Province, boundary markers should be erected, and five copies of detailed maps of the area boundaries should be submitted for approval. In addition, contact should be made with the boundary demarcation committee of the three provinces' bandit suppression headquarters and a report should be submitted. (2) The area of the Jinjiazhai County establishment area should be investigated and submitted for approval. (3) The current population, number of refugees, the remaining situation of destroyed villages and houses, and the methods of post-war resettlement in the county establishment area should be investigated and planned separately and submitted for approval. (4) The number of fields and the rural economic situation in the county establishment area should be investigated and reported. (5) The name of the new county should be discussed and proposed jointly with the county magistrates of each county and submitted for approval. (6) The amount of start-up funds required and the methods of raising them. (7) The location of the county establishment and the county government buildings, as well as its affiliated agencies, schools, prisons, etc., whether there are suitable places, and how to design them, should be planned in detail. (8) The changes in the autonomous areas of the five counties of Liuan, Huoshan, Huoqiu, Gushi, and Shangcheng, and the delineation of the autonomous areas after the establishment of Jinjiazhai County, should be properly planned.

<p>Local Communication</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>▲Two Robberies Injured People. Hou Hujin, a villager from the Twenty-Fifth Salt Map of Punan, was robbed and suffered heavy losses before, and the case has not been solved. Unexpectedly, on the night of the 6th, dozens of robbers speaking Hakka dialect came again and guarded the main road. The villagers were awakened from their sleep and heard the noise. They were frightened by the bandits and forbidden to make a sound. At the same time, they divided into groups to search and rob the four families of Xu Dajin and others. It took a long time. The victim Xu Dajin thought that the bandits had gone far away, so he went out with a knife and shouted to catch the robbers. He was shot in the leg by a lookout and fell to the ground in extreme pain. After the bandits plundered enough, they went towards the Huangpu River. It is said that after Xu Dajin was injured, he went to a doctor in Songjiang for treatment. Fortunately, the injury was not serious and there was no danger to his life. Also, the family of Wang Fusheng in Dujiatang, Changqiao East, Xin Zhuang was also suddenly robbed by three robbers speaking Hakka dialect the night before. They broke into the house with torches and plundered wantonly. When they failed to get what they wanted, they tied up the old man, his daughter-in-law, and his grandson and tortured them in every possible way before leaving with their loot. Wang's daughter-in-law was the most seriously injured. It is planned to report to the county for examination and request that the case be investigated and dealt with to reassure the villagers.</p>
<h3>Wujiang</h3>
<p>▲Director of the Bureau of Construction Transferred to Jiangning.

On the same night, the Silk Factory Association held a temporary members' meeting. Representatives of the County Party Department and the Industrial Union were present. Chairman Qian Fengting discussed the results and decided that the matter would be discussed again after the members' representative meeting of the union decided on a solution. And yesterday (the 9th), twenty-five silk factories in the entire city, including Zhengyi and Zhenyuan, were affected by the strike. All Huaxin silk factories were not within the scope of the strike because they were training centers. It is also heard that the Dongfeng and Dingchang factories have not yet gone on strike. The union has convened a representative meeting of each factory to discuss the matter, while the capitalists have adopted a silent attitude and have not yet expressed their views.</p>
<p>▲Clearing Labor Undertaking Expenses. As of last month, the Wuxi labor undertaking expenses were in arrears of more than 3,500 yuan. The Party and Government Dialogue Conference had previously resolved the clearing method: (1) The minimum expense of the labor hospital was set at 400 yuan; (2) The Silk Factory Association was notified to deduct the labor undertaking fee on behalf of the labor union; (3) The Textile Factory Federation was notified to instruct each factory to prepay six months of subsidies and to donate 400 yuan separately; (4) The cotton cloth factory, flour factory, sock factory, and oil factory were consulted and persuaded to donate 400 yuan separately. (5) All arrears should be settled clearly at a discount. Except for the hospital, the school equipment and sundries of each school should be received and kept in custody. The above resolutions were notified separately and have been properly contacted. It was decided to complete the settlement on the 15th of this month. All the money recognized and paid by each industry has also been submitted to the county finance office in advance. As for the deduction of labor undertaking fees on behalf of the silk factories in the future, the Silk Factory Association has also sent letters to each factory for reference and implementation.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>▲Detectives and Bandits Both Killed and Injured. At Erliban Bridge (also known as Shahekou, Shajiken) on Kuazi Street, Dongguan, more than a dozen bandits suddenly came on the night of the 7th, each holding a pistol or a box gun, and broke into two thatched houses nearby and occupied them. On the morning of the 8th, the house owner reported to the county government's detective team and sent detectives to arrest them. The bandits fired at Detective Sun Xuewen, killing him. Later, Police Squad Leader Zhao led a team to the scene and killed one bandit on the spot. Liu Jinzhang, Liu Weizhi, Liu Chunfu, Shi Er (also injured), Zhang Daoming, and other five people were captured and taken to the team for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>▲Victory News of the Maritime Guerrilla Team Suppressing Bandits. A large group of sea bandits from Haizhou Gang have been harassing the coastal areas of Tonghai and Qi counties, colluding with local bandits to stir up trouble. The Provincial Security Maritime Guerrilla Team stationed in Lvsi was ordered by the province to go to the waters of the company town and other places to suppress them. Two bandit ships were sunk, and many male and female hostages were rescued. The bandits fled north.</p>

As a result, clothes, jewelry, and other items worth several hundred yuan were robbed. They escaped without a trace.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing</h3>
<p>▲The County Government Prepares to Store Grain. Because the case of building a warehouse to store grain has not yet been handled by the Shaoxian government, and the harvests in various places have all been bountiful, the market price of new grain is only more than 30 yuan per dan. The low price of grain is unprecedented in the past ten years. It was decided to convene the County Grain Management Committee on the afternoon of the 8th to use all the accumulated disaster relief donations to purchase grain for disaster relief, and temporarily use public temples as warehouses.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>▲Two Floating Corpses Found. A floating corpse was found in Dangshan Bay, Dongxiang, Xiaoshan on the 3rd of this month. It was spotted by fishermen and reported to the nearest village police for coffin burial. Unexpectedly, another floating corpse was found in the same place on the 5th. The nearby people were all surprised. According to reports, five fishermen drowned while fishing by the river last month, so there are a total of five corpses. Now they have been washed ashore by the tide and discovered.</p>
<h3>Hefei</h3>
<p>▲A Large Number of Communist Suspects Escorted to the Provincial Capital. In recent years, communist bandits have often mixed into Hefei, posting slogans everywhere and disrupting public order. Although the military and police organs have seriously investigated and arrested them, they have not been able to solve the case. In the middle of last month, a communist bandit surrendered himself in the provincial capital, explaining that the Hefei communist bandit organs were located at the Tongde Pharmacy on Gu Lou West Street, which supplied medicines to the communist bandits, and next to Zhifang Bridge, which was a secret work place. He also gave out names. The Provincial Party Department sent detectives Gao and others to Hefei to meet with the County Party Department and requested the 55th Division Headquarters to send a team to go directly to the above-mentioned two pseudo-organs. They arrested Wu Zhaozhong, Wu Zhao, Wu Yibing, Zhou Zhibin, Zhang Zongben, Tao Jide, Yan Zifan, Ji Ziyou, Liu Er, Huang Deshou, Liu Jiawen, Sun Jiayu, Sun Jifu, Zhang Youguang, Yu Xiaohong, Cheng Daofu, Hou Shicai, Li Guangyu, Yu Zhengxian, Yu Dajie, Li Chenshi, Zhang Erjie, Lu Yousheng, and other 23 male and female communist suspects. The Provincial Party Department and the Provincial Government sent telegrams to the local Party and government organs, instructing them to quickly escort them to the provincial capital for interrogation. Therefore, on the morning of the 3rd, the county government escorted the 23 criminals to the provincial capital under the escort of the police team.</p>

<h3>Telegram from Feng Yuxiang and Others</h3>
<p>▲Pointing Out Errors in the Report</p>
<p>The Far East News Agency reports that Li Liejun, Bo Wenwei, Cheng Qian, and Feng Yuxiang, Central Committee members residing in Shanghai, yesterday issued a telegram to the nation, with Feng taking the lead, stating: "To the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Southwest Executive Department in Guangzhou, Party Headquarters of various provinces and cities, various organizations, and various newspaper offices: Since the outbreak of hostilities with Japan, the authorities have adopted a policy of non-resistance, entrusting the future of the entire Chinese nation to the League of Nations. Only now has the report of the investigation team been published. This report is not only related to the credibility of the League of Nations, but is also eagerly awaited by countless of our people who have suffered bloodshed and endured pain for years. The report itself should be fair and impartial, so that the prolonged Sino-Japanese dispute can be fully and reasonably resolved. However, the facts are greatly contrary to this. The first eight chapters of the report, concerning the examination of the Sino-Japanese dispute, apart from providing vague explanations for the atrocities of the Japanese invaders that are difficult to conceal, completely avoid providing a direct answer to the most important question of responsibility. Instead, they blame our side for the economic boycott movement initiated by the Japanese invasion, confusing the truth, reversing cause and effect, and implicitly exonerating the Japanese invaders, which is already clearly visible. In chapters nine and ten, the recommendations for resolving the Sino-Japanese dispute include the establishment of a demilitarized zone under a special constabulary in Manchuria, and the establishment of an autonomous government with broad powers in Manchuria. The army is supposed to safeguard the exercise of national sovereignty. If Chinese troops cannot be stationed in Manchuria, it is tantamount to Manchuria no longer belonging to us. The establishment of an autonomous government must be based on the free will of the local people. Tens of millions of people in the Northeast are fighting bloody battles to preserve the integrity of their nation and territory. The report proposes to forcibly establish an autonomous government in Manchuria through external forces, which violates the principle of establishing a government and divides our Chinese nation, which is equivalent to the Japanese invaders manipulating the puppet state of Manchuria. In addition, the establishment of advisory committees and the active expansion and protection of Japanese rights all put our country in a precarious position. This solution, which violates justice and fairness, is tantamount to subjecting our country to the shackles of international co-management in addition to the Japanese invasion. If the people of our country are not willing to be vassals of the great powers, how can they give general approval to this? We hereby solemnly declare that saving the country lies in active resistance. Only resistance can demonstrate the nation's determination to survive, and only determination can shift international attention. Merely seeking help from the League of Nations is national suicide. This has been our unwavering belief for the past year, and is further confirmed by today's facts. If the authorities today are truly determined to save the country, they should make a resolute change in policy, abandon the policy of non-resistance and the delusion of relying on the League of Nations, quickly release the people from their shackles, genuinely cooperate with the people, mobilize the whole country, resist the Japanese invaders and recover lost territories, and reverse the unfavorable international situation so that the nation's precarious life can be preserved. Furthermore, at this time of national crisis, the people of the whole country should not forget their status and responsibility as masters of the country, closely monitor the government, and resolutely fight for armed resistance, so that the iron heel of the Japanese invaders will not remain in China, and the incorrect international mediation will not be realized. The survival of the nation depends on this. We hope that our compatriots across the country will urgently plan for it. The telegram is filled with indignation and cannot be fully expressed. Feng Yuxiang, Li Liejun, Wen [ ], Xiong Kewu, Zhang Zhiben, Liu Luyin, Chen Jiayou, Zhang Dingfan, Xue Dubi, Cheng Qian, Huang Fusheng, Huang Jilu, Sun Jingya, Gui Tangji, Fu Rulin, respectfully kowtow."</p>

<h3>Sun Ke Still Advocates Early Completion of Political Tutelage</h3>
<p>Mr. Sun Zhesheng sent the article "Hopes for National Day Commemoration Amid National Crisis" yesterday. The following is recorded:</p>
<p>Several newspaper offices wanted me to say a few words on Double Ten Day. Now that the national crisis is still in a very severe period, I still want to contribute some opinions on this issue. Our current national crisis is not a purely diplomatic issue, but an issue that is closely related to domestic politics. How do you say that? Because Japan's forceful occupation of our three eastern provinces is purely a violent act by Japan that violates international law and disregards international justice. However, the reason why our country did not actively resist at that time, and still cannot decisively take active actions to recover lost territories, is indeed due to various difficulties in our domestic politics, such as the consideration of whether the strength is sufficient to resist Japan, the worries about the bandits and communists disturbing the rear, and the inability of political leaders to maintain consistency, etc. It is undeniable that these are the difficulties in our domestic politics, and it is also obvious that they are important reasons why the problem of the three eastern provinces has not been resolved so far. From this, we can see that it is not enough to solve the problem of the three eastern provinces by simply thinking from a diplomatic perspective. We must first break through the various difficulties in our domestic politics, and then we can find a way out in diplomacy. Since the release of the League of Nations Investigation Team report, the rights and wrongs of the "September 18th" incident last year and the inside story of the establishment of the puppet state have been made clear to the world. Since then, international public opinion has undoubtedly turned to us. Moreover, if the reports that France has changed its pro-Japanese attitude and that its views on the Far East issue are gradually converging with those of Britain and the United States are reliable, then our difficulties in diplomacy in the future will definitely be reduced a lot. However, if we take a broad look at the trends in the entire international relations, we can understand that this flicker of light is just an occasional embellishment in the dark clouds. The current international relations have become very clear and are rapidly deteriorating. The terrible conditions and results of the last European war seem to have faded away with time, and can no longer arouse people's enthusiasm for "anti-war." The diplomatic slogans that were most popular in the past ten years, such as "open diplomacy," "maintaining world peace," and "upholding international justice," etc., have gradually been regarded as the dreams of idiots. Countries around the world have long been preparing for the next massacre. The so-called League of Nations Disarmament Conference has almost become a club for diplomats to socialize and show off their eloquence. In short, future international relations have completely returned to the old path before the war. Countries only care about their own interests, and do not hesitate to sow discord, engage in conspiracies, and seek to harm others for their own benefit. In such international relations, only strength is the ultimate determinant of victory or defeat. If we do not quickly catch up, prepare the strength of the whole country, and use it as a backing for diplomacy, and want to seek the upholding of justice and the restoration of territorial sovereignty, then wouldn't that be dreaming? When I first arrived in Shanghai, I talked to reporters from various newspapers and repeatedly explained that after our country's diplomatic situation improves slightly compared to the past, I repeatedly emphasized that we must establish an independent foreign policy and should not rely solely on others, which is based on this theory. It is an undeniable fact that relying solely on the use of diplomacy, even if it is successful, cannot satisfactorily solve the problem of the three eastern provinces. It is also a commonly recognized truth that the power of the people of the whole country must be concentrated in order to solve the current national crisis. The problem is how to achieve this goal. In the program for resisting Japan and saving the country that I published this spring, I proposed shortening the period of political tutelage and implementing constitutionalism as soon as possible. Although some people may think that this is not in line with the provisions of the Founding Program, or that the majority of the Chinese people still do not have the ability to implement democracy, and oppose it, I still believe that this is the method that should be implemented. Those who oppose it really fail to calmly look at the current situation of our party. Those who oppose it really fail to calmly think about whether our party, which is not very healthy and needs fundamental transformation, can still complete political tutelage. Although I clearly know that waiting until the completion of political tutelage, after the majority of the people have received training in the exercise of the four powers, and then implementing constitutionalism is the most appropriate method, I cannot deny the objective facts and admit that a party like ours, which is not healthy, can still complete political tutelage within two years (the Political Tutelage Program stipulates that 1934 will be the end of the political tutelage period). Therefore, I advocate giving the people the right to participate in politics early in this serious period of national crisis. In this way, on the one hand, we can concentrate the power of the whole country to face the national crisis together, and on the other hand, we can encourage our party comrades to work hard for the revival of our party through the competition of other political parties. As for the fear that defects will occur due to the people's lack of ability to implement democracy, I also think it is worth paying attention to, but our proper way is to try our best to remedy it, not to fundamentally oppose the implementation of constitutionalism because of this. I believe that if this proposition is implemented sincerely, China's domestic and foreign affairs may unfold a new situation. Therefore, on this day, the founding anniversary of the Republic of China, I once again raise it to the people of the whole country, hoping that the people of the whole country will work together to promote its realization.</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Enters Beijing Today</h3>
<p>▲Went to Hangzhou Yesterday Morning and Returned to Shanghai in the Evening</p>
<p>Song Ziwen, Acting President of the Executive Yuan, Ms. Zhang Lezhao, his wife, his younger brothers Song Ziliang and Song Zian, Zhang Xueliang's secretary Li Yingchao, Finance Department Secretary Huang Chundao, and guards, etc., boarded three cars at 7:30 yesterday morning and went to Hangzhou for sightseeing via the Shanghai-Hangzhou highway. At 10:30 last night, they returned to Shanghai from Hangzhou by special train, and are scheduled to take a private plane to Beijing this morning with their entourage to continue discussing the investigation team's report with the ministers of the central departments, and finally decide on the government's response policy.</p>
<h3>Chen Mingshu Still Staying in Shanghai</h3>
<p>▲The Trip Abroad May Be Cancelled</p>
<p>Since Chen Mingshu, Minister of Communications, submitted his resignation to the Central Government and came to Shanghai, he has planned to travel abroad, but the Central Government has not yet approved Chen's resignation, and has only granted him a vacation period. At the same time, Chen has also expressed that the trip abroad can be postponed due to the ongoing national crisis. Although there have been rumors of his trip abroad recently, it has not been implemented yet. The rumors that he left Shanghai on a French postal ship the day before yesterday have been denied by Chen's relatives and friends. According to a reporter from the New Voice News Agency, Chen's family said by phone that it was absolutely not true and that he is still staying in Shanghai. It seems that the trip abroad will be postponed for further discussion. Judging from his words, Chen's trip abroad seems to have been cancelled.</p>
<h3>Four Doctors Release Wang Jingwei's Diagnosis</h3>
<p>After four doctors, Nauer and others, consulted with Wang Jingwei, they released a diagnosis as follows: "We examined Mr. Wang Jingwei today and found that he has diabetes and cirrhosis, Dialetismeuiusan dcirrhosis, and clear evidence of biliary obstruction. The source of this disease is probably due to the liver's blood-sucking leeches, Clonorchissinensis, which cause it to swell. Therefore, Mr. Wang urgently needs a complete rest for a minimum of three months. When his body is possible, he needs to change the environment. After three months, Mr. Wang should be re-examined to determine whether he can return to work. "Doctors Nauer, Jiahui Lin, Tan Shen, and Luo Guanglin.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Northeast Refugee Relief Association Established</h3>
<p>▲Launching a Monthly Donation Campaign</p>
<p>Since Zhu Qinglan and Cai Tingkai initiated the Northeast Refugee Relief Association, branches have been organized in various places such as Hong Kong, Hankou, and Tianjin.

Wang Xiaolai, Shi Liangcai, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, and Yu Qiaqing were jointly elected as chairmen of the board of directors. The other initiators such as Wang Yansong, You Jusun, Fang Jiaobo, Zhu Qinglan, Jiang Wenyu, He Dekui, [ ], Li Fusun, Bei Songsun, Yu Zuoting, Yu Yefeng, Yu Huancheng, Zha Liangzhao, Hu Mengjia, Hu Yunqiu, Hu Yunan, Hu Yunzhuang, Xu Caicheng, Xu Jilu, Xu Xinliu, Xu Jingren, Xu Yushu, Ma Shaoquan, Ma Jiliang, Zhang Weiru, Guo Shun, Lu Wenshao, Chen Songyuan, Chen Zeqing, Chen Yizhou, Lao Jingxiu, Huang Renzhi, Zou Bingwen, Yang Xixian, Yang Zhixiong, Ye Jiaxing, Wen Lanting, Pei Yunqing, Liu Hongsheng, Pan Xulun, Pan Xusheng, Zheng Zenan, Jiang Zhigang, Chu Huiseng, Mu Ouchu, Gui Yanfang, Zhu Wenqi, Qian Zhixiang, Luo Qinghua, Nie Lusheng, Yan Esheng, etc. are all directors. Mu Ouchu was appointed as the director of the General Affairs Group, Wang Yansong and Jiang Wenyu as the deputy directors, Wang Xiaolai as the director of the Donation Group, Luo Qinghua and Gui Yanfang as the deputy directors, Lin Kanghou as the director of the Propaganda Group, Yan Esheng and Huang Renzhi as the deputy directors, Bei Songsun as the director of the Custody Group, Hu Mengjia and Wu Yunqi as the deputy directors, Shi Liangcai as the director of the Disbursement Group, Xu Jilu and Yu Zuoting as the deputy directors, Hu Yunzhuang as the director of the Audit Group, Xu Yushu and Pan Xulun as the deputy directors, and Ren Jinping, Du Chongyuan, Yao Wenfu, Hu Yunqiu, Hu Yunan, Xu Guannan, Sun Mingqi, Yin Jichang, Ma Shaoquan, Lu Jingt, Tao Leqin, Chen Songyuan, Chen Mutang, Cao Zhigong, Lao Jingxiu, Cheng Muhao, Xiang Yuancun, Yang Xixian, Yang Zhixiong, Ye Jiaxing, Zheng Zhengqiu, Zheng Chengqing, etc. were invited as directors of various groups, and will proceed immediately, and it was also decided that the office expenses will be borne by the initiators. The various agencies for receiving funds will be announced after contact. A very heavy-hearted declaration is planned, which is excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>▲Shanghai Northeast Refugee Relief Association Monthly Donation Campaign Declaration Alas, since the "September 18th" Incident last year, our Northeast compatriots have suffered extremely from the poisonous hands of the Japanese invaders. What the newspapers have recorded, what the picture books have depicted, and what those who have entered the pass have recounted, anyone with blood and qi, who would not cry to the sky and tear their eyes? The weak are writhing and struggling under the knives and saws, seeking life but finding no way, seeking death but finding no place, which is also cruel. But if the strong cannot bear the fall of their home country and the brutal murder of their brothers and sisters, they would rather risk their lives of ten thousand deaths, and fight for the dignity of the Chinese nation that is about to be destroyed. Those who fall in front, those who follow behind, do not hesitate to use flesh and blood to paint and render this broken country. A scholar can be killed, but cannot be humiliated. Territory can be occupied, but peace and quiet cannot be allowed for a day. National treasures can be seized, but they must not be allowed to be loaded and carried away with ease. For a year, they have been driven to death by this single thought of loving their homeland and their country, and they do not know how many. Those who have not died have no food to eat when hungry, no clothes to wear when cold, and they bathe in blood and drive for a long time during the day, and sleep in the open with their weapons as pillows at night. The cool autumn is desolate, the birds are gone, and the wind is howling. This is truly not a life for human beings. Who are they? They can be called righteous people, or they can be called refugees. China is the country shared by our 400 million people. Since the Northeast is a corner of our China, the gains and losses of the Northeast are a major key to the survival of our entire nation. Can the people in our mainland and our Shanghai turn a blind eye and pretend not to see? Can they turn a deaf ear and pretend not to hear? Xiaolai, Liangcai, Yuesheng, Xiaolin, Qiaqing, etc. are saddened and frightened, saddened by the fact that the Northeast is in deep water and needs expanded assistance, and frightened by the fact that the national crisis is still in its infancy and needs long-term assistance. They used to gather comrades from all walks of life to launch a monthly donation campaign. Those who have the strength move the money from leisure and entertainment, and the more the better. Those who do not have the strength save on the daily clothing and food, and even a small amount is fine. In the agency, the leader leads his colleagues, and in the public group, the masses are united to seek consent. In factories and shops, either deduct a part of the hard-earned money or share a part of the surplus of business. In the family, parents, brothers, and sisters advocate in front, and children, younger brothers, and younger sisters follow behind. Ask if you want to buy cakes and fruits? Say, no, I will donate to the Northeast. Ask if you want to watch dramas and movies? Say, no, I will donate to the Northeast. Ask if you want beautiful clothes and delicious food? Say, no, I will donate to the Northeast. This is not an ordinary charitable act, but a great education for children, accumulating months into years, accumulating small amounts into large amounts, each developing their conscience, each fulfilling their duty. Alas, if a person does not want to do good, then it is fine, but if he wants to do good, saving the dying and healing the wounded is the greatest act of doing good. If a person does not want to serve the country, then it is fine, but if he wants to serve the country, the country is broken and the family is destroyed, which is the last act of serving the country. All our compatriots across the country should take on this responsibility together, and our Shanghai compatriots should take the lead in taking on this responsibility. I hope that the public will understand. October 1932."</p>
<h3>Staff of This Newspaper Donate Funds to Relief Northeast Refugees</h3>
<p>Since the Northeast fell, our compatriots have risen up to resist Japan, and local order has been chaotic, causing the people to be unsettled. Therefore, the elderly, weak, women, and children who have fled are full of ditches and cars. Now that the winter season is approaching, those who have no clothes and no food are particularly pitiful. The staff of this newspaper, adhering to the patriotic spirit and the friendship of compatriots, donated 525.50 yuan, entrusted to Mr. Zhu Ziqiao to transfer it to the Northeast.</p>
<h3>A Brief Biography of Zhu Jiqing, Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast National Salvation Army</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhu Jiqing, a native of Beizhen County, Liaoning, went to Japan to study after the庚子 Year (1900). He entered the Dongbin School, joined the Tongmenghui (Chinese United League) at that time, and soon returned to China to oppose Xu Shichang, the Governor-General of the Three Eastern Provinces, from borrowing large sums of money. He secretly planned an assassination. Unfortunately, the matter was leaked, and Xu ordered his arrest. In辛亥 Year (1911), Lan Xiuhao organized the Guandong (Manchuria) People's Army Government, and Mr. Zhu served as a staff officer. The People's Army in various places was mostly under his command. Jin Ziming, the commander of the First Route of today's National Salvation Army, was also one of them. When the Second Revolution broke out, Huang Xing fled Nanjing. Mr. Zhu and He Haiming covered the retreat and later fled to Shanghai. Before long, he returned to Liaodong and traveled around Hunchun, Ningguta, Dongning, and Muling. In Bazhan Maqiaohe, he raised capital to organize the業墾 Company. Wang Delin, the Commander-in-Chief of the East Route of today's National Salvation Army, deeply respected Mr. Zhu at that time. When Yuan Shikai betrayed the country, Mr. Zhu, under the order of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen, went to Weixian, Shandong, and organized the Northeast People's Army with Ju Juesheng. When Yuan Shikai died and Duan Qirui came to power, Mr. Zhu was not employed. Duan then ordered Zhang Huaizhi, the Military Governor of Shandong, to transfer Mr. Zhu's troops to Jinan to disarm them and imprison Mr. Zhu. More than three years later, he was released from prison. In the 13th year of the Republic of China (1924), he participated in the reorganization of the Kuomintang (Nationalist Party) and went to Harbin to prepare for party affairs in the Three Eastern Provinces, also working for the Pingmin Weekly. In the winter of the 14th year (1925), he returned to Guangzhou from Vladivostok to participate in the work of the Central Party. When the Northern Expedition reached Wuhan, he served as the Chairman of the National Army Inspection Committee. After the separation of the Kuomintang and the Communists in Wuhan, he served as the Director of the Political Department of the Military Commission. After the cooperation of Ning and Han, he served as a member of the Central People's Training Committee and a member of the National Government Committee. After the September 18th Incident, Mr. Zhu was extremely indignant and vowed to make anti-Japanese resistance and national salvation his duty. This summer, in March, he sneaked out of the pass, passing through Lingnan, Liaoning, Jinxi, Yixian, and Beizhen, taking three months, enduring hardships, and repeatedly facing danger. Local militias and volunteer forces, hearing of his arrival, flocked to him like the wind. Mr. Zhu personally directed the troops and repeatedly defeated the Japanese army. However, due to a lack of bullets, he could not launch a large-scale attack to defeat the enemy. In July, he returned to Peiping, Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places to report and seek assistance from all parties. He is now out of the pass again to command the troops and is fighting against the tyrannical Japanese.</p>

The book begins with long prefaces by Mr. Ma Xiangbo and the editor. The content is rich, and everyone should have a copy. It is now published by the Japan Research Society.

<h3>Mrs. Muir Visited the War Zone Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Luncheon Invitation to General Weng Zhao Yuan Today</p>
<p>Mrs. Muir from the United States, who was accompanied by various relief items from the American public for our loyal and brave 19th Route Army, arrived in China specifically to offer comfort. As previously reported, yesterday, Mrs. Muir, accompanied by lawyer Lu Xingyuan, visited the Zhabei and Wusong war zones. She witnessed firsthand that the houses and property of the people in the once-prosperous areas of Shanghai and Songhu were bombed into rubble by airplanes, which she found to be quite different from the propaganda she had heard in Europe. Because what she saw was that the places bombed by airplanes were all civilian houses and not militarily contested points, she deeply lamented the innocent people who suffered such great losses. However, she was greatly impressed by Brigadier General Weng Zhaoyuan, who stubbornly defended Wusong on flat ground without any new equipment, resisting the enemy's large army, navy, and air force for more than 30 days. Therefore, upon returning to her residence, she telegraphed Yin Zhiling of the Aviation Construction Association, asking him to invite General Weng for lunch today at the Astor House Hotel to personally express her condolences and admiration.</p>

Chen Guangfu was elected as the chairman, Xu Xinliu, Chen Liting, Guo Bingwen, Liu Zhanen, and Nie Lusheng were elected as executive directors, Guo Bingwen concurrently serving as the director of the executive department, stipulating that the executive department shall implement the matters agreed upon by the board of directors and various committees, and handle all the work that the association should carry out. The following are the more important matters that have been handled since its establishment: (1) Appointed Gu Ziren to represent the association to work in the United States and disseminate correct information domestically. Reports were received one after another. He first arrived in the western United States and attended the National Press Conference and the International Relations Research Association. In both conferences, he gave speeches every day, with thousands of listeners. He was the only Chinese representative at the two conferences, while Japan had many representatives. Therefore, he was very tired from continuous lectures and debates. Recently, another report was received that he attended the Williams College Association of America, with 350 people present, all of whom were leaders from all walks of life. He and Jiang Kanghu were the only Chinese representatives. The Japanese representatives actively engaged in various activities and hosted banquets to entertain the members. However, because the arguments and speeches of our representatives were justified and forceful, the members were able to sympathize with our representatives. At that time, he planned to travel to Europe to participate in various international conferences, but he stopped because the members firmly requested him to stay. Now, due to overwork and illness, the doctor advised him to stop giving speeches, and because of economic constraints, it is difficult to maintain. It has been decided to return to China in mid-October. (2) In response to Japan's invasion of Rehe, a telegram was sent to the National Government, urging it to lead its troops and resist actively. (3) A telegram was sent to the League of Nations, requesting it to sanction the Japanese by effective means, so that it would implement the resolutions of the League of Nations that it had recognized, in order to protect the integrity of our country's sovereignty and territory. Regarding the Northeast customs issue, a telegram was drafted on behalf of the banking association, etc., to the Ministry of Finance and the British and American authorities. (4) In response to Japan's recognition of the puppet state, a telegram was sent to the National Government on behalf of the National Federation of Commerce, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Banking Association, and the Money Trade Association, protesting severely and urging the whole country to unite against foreign aggression. (5) On behalf of the National Federation of Commerce, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Banking Association, and the Money Trade Association, a telegram was sent to the League of Nations, stating that Japan's recognition of the puppet state further proved the destruction of China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and requesting it to impose effective sanctions. (6) Collected materials on Japanese atrocities and Chinese and foreign public opinion, published special books, and distributed them to various countries. (7) For the United States representative Gu Ziren, suggested strengthening the foreign envoys and contacted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (8) Welcomed the British envoy Guo Taiqi and discussed current diplomatic issues with him.

(11) Exchanged views with Cheng Qibao, the head of the education delegation to Europe. (12) Discussed cooperation methods between the two associations in the future with Xiong Bingsan, president of the Beiping League of Nations Association. (13) Published the International Bi-Weekly, the first, second, third, and fourth issues of Volume 1 have been published. In addition to being distributed to members and related public organizations in China, it has been praised by the outside world and subscriptions are increasing. (14) Compiled and translated a study of various international organizations. (15) Entrusted the China International Trade Association to study international economic issues, actively participate in the movement to promote domestic products, and actively plan development methods. The more important things that have been done in this regard are as follows: (A) Sent a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, forwarding to various trade associations, asking them to label the nationality of the foreign goods they sell within the possible scope, so that customers can recognize them. At the same time, a request was submitted to the Ministry of Industry to stipulate regulations, ordering all stores in the country to comply. Violators will be severely punished by the local government. (B) A request was submitted to the Ministry of Industry, suggesting that the Ministry of Finance stipulate regulations, ordering that foreign goods imported must be labeled with the name of the factory and the country of origin in order to prevent counterfeiting. Violators will be subject to heavy fines or bans on transportation. (C) Letters were sent to the Sincere, Wing On, and Sun Sun department stores, requesting them to set up special sections for domestic goods or to label foreign and domestic goods separately, so that patriotic people can purchase them. (D) Letters were sent to the Shanghai Machine-Made National Goods Factory Federation and the National Goods Factory Federation, forwarding to the members of the Chamber of Commerce, requesting that the goods sold abroad be specially labeled with the words "Made in China" to avoid difficulties from foreign customs. In addition, the text of the product description must be smooth and accurate to assist in advertising. (E) Translated or corrected store names in English.

<h3>The Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway Inauguration Ceremony Today</h3>
<p>▲ Participants gather before 9:30 AM</p>
<p>▲ Five organizations host guests from all circles.</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway between Shanghai and Hangzhou has been completed and the inauguration ceremony is scheduled to be held at 9:30 AM today.</p>
<p>[Picture: Map of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway]</p>
<p>Prior to the event, the National Economic Council, the Construction Departments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and the municipal governments of Shanghai and Hangzhou invited guests from all walks of life in Shanghai to participate in the ceremony and issued vehicle passes that allowed travel to Hangzhou or Zhalin and Haiyan. The details of the ceremony and the details of the road have been reported in the previous issue. This morning, participants gathered at the starting point of the Minhang Highway. Those in Shanghai who wish to participate can take the Shanghai-Minhang long-distance bus from the Shanghai-Minhang long-distance bus station on Guohuo Road in the South City, or take a public bus from Xujiahui Jinji Bridge directly to Minhang.</p>
<p>According to the National News Agency, the 216-kilometer Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway between Shanghai and Hangzhou will hold its official completion ceremony today. It is learned that the construction of this road was presided over by the National Economic Council, which is chaired by Finance Minister Song Ziwen, who also serves as the vice chairman. A road construction fund of 1 million yuan was raised to be used for the construction of roads nationwide in order to lend to the authorities in various provinces and cities to build roads. A road department was specially set up within the committee to hire well-known Chinese engineers as consultants to assist engineers from various provinces and cities in road construction. After the completion of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway today, the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang have already built 1,225 kilometers of motor roads and are building 320 kilometers of motor roads, which can be connected to Shanghai. As for the road construction program, it is currently quite economical. The main focus is on providing transportation, not on luxury, and it is suitable for road construction in rural areas. However, if it can be repaired on time, cars can come and go, and it is often comfortable and free. The new road is 7.5 meters wide, with a 3-meter paved center. The Shanghai-Minhang section is 9 meters wide and the paved center is 6 meters. In the future, after the number of vehicles increases, the paved road surface of the entire road will be widened to 5.5 meters. The sections from Shanghai to Minhang, Minhang to Nanqiao, and Hangzhou to Haining have already been built and public buses are already running. This time, thanks to the efforts and cooperation of the National Economic Council, the provincial and municipal authorities, and the Tao, the unfinished sections have been successively repaired and connected into one. After the opening of the road today, only commercial vehicles, including taxis, must pay a fee to the long-distance bus company when passing through Minhang. In addition, when crossing the river by ferry or pontoon bridge, the Jiangsu Construction Bureau also charges a small fee. As for self-owned cars and motorcycles, no fees are required. It is also heard that from New Year's Day next year, these donations will be abolished. Also, if cars travel on the highways of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces and the cities of Nanjing and Shanghai, it is not necessary to donate additional permits. The original permits can pass without hindrance. As for the supply of gasoline and temporary repairs along the way, you can contact the long-distance bus station along the way.</p>
<p>▲ Travel agency organizes tours</p>
<p>In order to celebrate the completion of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway, China Travel Service has specially organized a Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway tour to allow Chinese and foreign people in Shanghai to appreciate the scenery of various towns along the way. The tour dates are set from today to the 20th. The company has negotiated with the Lily Motor Company and specially prepared a number of cars, each limited to four people. Every day from 7:00 AM to 8:00 AM, they will gather at the main office at No. 114 Sichuan Road and set off. The route goes through Caohejing and reaches the Shanghai-Min-Zhe-Nan Road. Get off the car at Minhang Town, cross the Huangpu River, and transfer to a car. Take the road to Nanqiao, Zhalin, Jinshanwei, and Jinliniangqiao. After this, it is the highway under the jurisdiction of Zhejiang Province, passing through Zhapu to Haiyan. When the car arrives at Zhapu or Haiyan, it is near noon, get off the car to rest and have some refreshments (provided by the company). After the meal, continue from Haiyan, passing through Ganpu Town, Haining, Qiaosi, and directly reaching the West Lake in Hangzhou. This trip is 130 miles. The company had previously sent a special commissioner to inspect the road and learned that the road is very flat, as if walking on a thoroughfare, and the scenery along the way is very good, especially the section from Zhapu to Haining, where the scenery is the best. Because this section is next to the sea, and there are many high mountains, overlooking the sea and the sky, and the vast waves, you really feel relaxed and happy. Seagulls soar high, as if you are in a picture. The fare is tentatively set at 7 yuan for each person for a one-way trip and 12 yuan for a round trip. After arriving in Hangzhou, tourists can stay for a few days and still take the car back to Shanghai. If you want to charter a car to visit the scenic spots of West Lake for half a day, the tentative price is 10 yuan per car, 2.5 yuan per person for each ride, which is very cheap. If you want to join, you must make arrangements as soon as possible to avoid missing out. The tour route is as follows: Gather at the China Travel Service, set off along Sichuan Road, pass through Edouard Road, Avenue Joffre, Xujiahui Road, Jinji Road, Caohejing, Shanghai-Min-Zhe-Nan Road, Minhang Town, cross the Huangpu River, Nanqiao, Zhalin, Jinshanwei, Jinliniangqiao (the above is the highway under the jurisdiction of Jiangsu Province), Zhapu, Haiyan, Ganpu Town, Huangwan, Haining, Qiaosi, get off the car in front of the China Travel Service on the lakeside road in Hangzhou (the above is the highway under the jurisdiction of Zhejiang Province). Departure time: from Shanghai to Hangzhou, 7:00 AM to 8:00 AM; from Hangzhou to Shanghai, 12:00 PM to 1:00 PM.

<h3>The Mastermind Behind the Assassination of Wu Guangzong</h3>
<p>▲ The captain of the Huzhou Security Brigade's Detective Team.</p>
<p>The case of Wu Guangzong, the Director of the Hydrographic Office of the Navy Department, who was assassinated by thugs last month at his private residence, Ningkang Lane, Anlan Road, West Gate, Nanshi, has resulted in the arrest of four suspects, including Song Jianhai, by the police authorities of the Chinese and French concessions at the Jue Lu Hotel on Tibet Road and the Dahua Hotel on Fuzhou Road. They were handed over to the Special First Court for repeated investigations. Wu Guangzong's family members, Wu's wife, Zhong Huizhen, and Wu's maid, Qiuhong, and bodyguard, Xu Chunhua, testified in court, pointing out the details of the murderer. This has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. However, Wen Hong'en, the Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, attached great importance to this case because it happened at the beginning of Wen's tenure. Recently, although the case has been solved, it is still felt that the four people arrested are definitely not the masterminds. He ordered Detective Team Captain Lu Ying to thoroughly investigate in order to reveal the truth. Now it is learned that Captain Lu's investigation revealed that the mastermind behind the case was Zhang Changlin, the captain of the Second Regiment Detective Team of the Huzhou Security Brigade, and two others. A secret telegram was immediately sent to Qingpu County to arrest them. It is heard that Zhang was arrested by the county's detective team the day before yesterday. Wen Hong'en, the Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, immediately ordered Captain Lu to send team leader Gu Liancheng and detective Gong Fujin to Qingpu to escort the suspects.</p>
<h3>Record of the Trial of Qian Zhaofu and Pu Wenting Kidnapping Case</h3>
<p>▲ Perpetrators Continue to Shift Blame</p>
<p>▲ Two Previously Arrested Perpetrators Retract Their Confessions</p>
<p>Qian Zhaofu, a local owner of the Fengtai Lumber Company in the Nanshi area, and Pu Wenting, manager of the Fuxin Flour Mill from Wuxi, were kidnapped for ransom in the French Concession last year. After the incidents, detectives from the French Police apprehended two key suspects in Qian Zhaofu's kidnapping case: Luo A'er and Yang Defu (both from Pudong). They were handed over to the former French Court, where they were found guilty and sentenced to five years of imprisonment each. Upon completion of their sentences, they were to be transferred to the mainland Chinese authorities for further investigation. The remaining kidnappers remained at large. Last month, Jin Jiulin, a supervisor of the special agency of the French Police, along with detectives Li Yaolong and Zhang Ziying, and other detectives, successively</p>
<p>arrested six individuals in Wuxi and Shanghai who were involved in the kidnappings of Qian and Pu: Zhang Jiancheng, Zhang Afu, Gao A'da, Zheng Shifan (a person of interest), Lu Liangqing, and Zhao Xingsheng. A handgun and several bullets were confiscated from Zhang Afu's residence. They were transferred to the Second Special District Local Court. The police filed a public lawsuit accusing them of joint kidnapping for ransom and conspiracy under criminal law. Judge Xiong Huiben presided over the preliminary hearing, instructing that the case files of Luo A'er from the former French Court be retrieved, and that Luo A'er and others be brought to court for further questioning. This information has been previously reported. The case has been heard several times. Due to the unavailability of the French Court's case files, the police were asked to provide the French version of the files, which have now been reviewed. At 3 PM the day before yesterday, Judge Xiong, accompanied by clerk Tao, continued the hearing at the Criminal Division. They also ordered the police to bring Luo A'er and Yang Defu, who were already convicted prisoners at the Second Special District Prison, to be questioned. First, Gu Yupeng, representing the victim Qian Zhaofu, recounted the details of his three meetings with the kidnappers on Taixi Road</p>
<p>after Qian Zhaofu was kidnapped by the perpetrators on behalf of his family. Pu Wenting could not be summoned as his original residence had been moved. Next, Zheng Shifan was questioned, and he claimed to have no knowledge of the kidnappings of Qian and Pu. Although he was a former neighbor of Luo A'er, he was unaware of his involvement in kidnapping. Despite repeated rebuttals from the court, he vehemently denied any involvement. Zhang Liancheng confessed that Luo A'er first ordered him to drive the car used to kidnap Qian Zhaofu, and later Ni Yayi ordered him to</p>
<p>drive the car used to kidnap Pu. Afterwards, he received 1,600 yuan in silver. He also stated that he had met and spoken with Zheng Shifan inside Bao Yu Li number 48. Zhang Afu confessed that Ni Yayi first ordered him to rent a house in the countryside near Beiqiao. About half a month later, he was told to wait on Xietu Road. He waited near Mingde School for about an hour. Then, they brought Pu Wenting, whom he led to Beiqiao and hid in the rented house. Afterwards, at room 413 of the East Asia Hotel, Ni gave him 1,600 yuan in silver. Zheng Shifan was not in the room at that time. At this point, the court ordered Luo A'er to be brought to the stand. When asked if he knew Zheng Shifan and Zhang Jiancheng, Luo replied that he did not know either of them.</p>
<p>When questioned about the kidnapping of Qian Zhaofu, he also claimed to have no knowledge of it and that he was wrongly accused. Next, Yang Defu was brought to the stand for questioning. He also claimed not to know Zheng Shifan and Zhang Jiancheng, and to be unaware of the kidnapping. The court ordered Luo and Yang to step down and questioned Gao A'da. He then retracted his previous confession (in which he admitted that Ni Yayi had ordered him to jointly kidnap Pu Wenting and that he had received 500 yuan in silver). He completely denied any knowledge of the Pu kidnapping and claimed that he had always been in Wuxi</p>
<p>and had never been to Shanghai, so how could he have been involved in kidnapping? He requested that the original victim be brought to identify him, and if he was identified on the spot, he would accept being shot without complaint. Lu Liangqing also retracted his confession. Although he knew Ni Yayi in Wuxi, he denied having worked as a bookkeeper in Pu Wenting's house for four years. At that time, Ni was the captain of the patrol team in Wuxi. He gambled on Pai Gow at the house of Chief Zhu of the military police inspection office, and he was also present. Zhu borrowed 1,000 yuan from Ni, and he guaranteed the loan. He denied any knowledge of the kidnapping. Zhao Xiusheng testified that Ni Yayi</p>
<p>was a captain in Wuxi, and he worked in the water police. They were both public servants and knew each other. When Ni left his post, he owed more than 700 yuan in debt, which he covered. Later, Ni returned 1,000 yuan to him. In July of the previous year, he met Ni in front of the Sincere Company. Ni told him that he was staying at the East Asia Hotel. He denied any knowledge of the kidnapping of Pu and did not know Zheng Shifan either. At this point, the court considered the factual questioning to be complete and ordered the commencement of arguments. First, police lawyer Fei Xizhen argued on each defendant's criminal behavior. Then, defendants Zheng Shifan was defended by lawyers Zhao Zuwei, Ai Zhenlin, and Qin Liankui. Zhang Jiancheng and Zhang Afu were defended by lawyer Qin Zemin. Lu Liangqing was defended by lawyer Zhu Kuangming. Gao A'da and Zhao Xiusheng were defended by court-appointed lawyers Dong Yu and Tao Jiachun, providing pro bono defense. After all the lawyers had presented their arguments, it was already late evening. The court adjourned, declaring the arguments concluded, and scheduled a date for sentencing. The defendants were then returned to police custody separately.</p>
<h3>Silk Factory Workers Resumed Work Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Police Protection Ensures Excellent Order</p>
<p>▲ Tongyi Will Reopen Today After Persuasion</p>
<p>Following the resolution of the labor dispute between the silk factories and their workers in this city, which was mediated by the Social Affairs Bureau, factories in the Hongkou District tentatively resumed operations yesterday morning, with female workers fully returning to work. Huaitongyi is scheduled to reopen this morning.</p>
<p>▲ Zhabei Concession Operates as Usual The silk factories in the Zhabei Concession resumed operations as usual yesterday morning. The executive committee of the Sixth and Third Raw Silk Industry Workers' Unions, fearing unfortunate incidents during the tentative reopening of factories in the Hongkou District yesterday, dispatched all their staff to locations such as Liuying Road, Taiyang Temple, Tanjiachiao, Changan Road, Guoqing Road, and the Alabaster Road in the Zhabei Concession, and also the French Concession to maintain order. Simultaneously, the Shanghai Municipal Police Force's Fourth District and the Public Concession Police Force dispatched armed police officers. At that time, the female factory workers proceeded to their work as usual.</p>
<p>▲ Hongkou Workers Return to Work Twelve silk factories in Hongkou District, including Yuncheng, Renji, Tongwei, and Yujing, except for Yichang, Xiangcheng, and Tongyi, resumed operations yesterday morning at 5 AM, sounding the whistle to indicate the start of work, based on the resolution of the Silk Industry Guild. At 5:30 AM, they sounded the whistle again to officially start work. Meanwhile, the Fifth District Third Branch of the Shanghai Municipal Police Force dispatched armed police officers to be stationed near each factory to strictly prevent any incidents. At that time, the female factory workers were all at the factory entrances, and after the supervisors persuaded them, they immediately entered the factories to resume work. However, the number of workers was only about 70-80% of the total. By 7 AM, all workers had fully resumed work, and the order was excellent.</p>
<p>▲ Tongyi to Resume Work This Morning The Yichang Silk Factory in Hongkou District has been closed and relocated to Wuxi. The Tongyi Silk Factory was also preparing to close due to the workers' strike, so it did not open yesterday morning. The Xiangcheng Silk Factory had transferred its raw materials to Zhabei and entrusted them to other factories for processing due to the workers' strike, so it also did not open yesterday morning. Upon receiving the report, the chairman of the Silk Industry Guild, Shen Huachen, persuaded the managers of the two factories to resume operations as soon as possible in order to maintain the livelihoods of the workers. Tongyi has accepted the persuasion and is scheduled to resume operations today. However, Xiangcheng, due to the depletion of raw materials, is seeking assistance from the cocoon merchants entrusted with processing after being persuaded, and if they agree to provide raw materials, they will immediately resume operations.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications Requests Research on Soviet Far East Civil Aviation Construction</h3>
<p>▲ Letter to the Aviation Construction Association</p>
<p>The Chinese Aviation Construction Association received a letter No. 262 from the Ministry of Communications yesterday, requesting research on the civil aviation construction in the Soviet Far East. It is reported that the association has already submitted the report to the Design Committee for research and design reference. The Ministry of Communications' letter and report are as follows: To whom it may concern, this Ministry has received a public letter from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stating that the Consulate in Chita has submitted Report No. 48 from Qi Yu, which contains a section on the civil aviation construction in the Soviet Far East, which is suitable for your Ministry's reference. A copy of the corresponding letter is enclosed for your review and return, etc. In addition to the Ministry's reply, the matter concerns international civil aviation construction, which may be of reference for your association's research and discussion. Therefore, we specifically enclose the original report for your reference. Sincerely, Postal Department of the Ministry of Communications, October 7th.</p>
<p>The Soviet Far East is mostly mountainous, and due to its proximity to the Arctic Ocean, the climate is severe, hindering the development of transportation. Its land transportation consists only of the Ussuri and Trans-Baikal railways, which run between Vladivostok and Irkutsk, serving as the only major transportation route in the Far East. Other routes include inland river transport, but statistics show that only 41% of the total river area of 130,000 kilometers is navigable. The most notable rivers are the Heilongjiang (Amur River) and Anadyr River. Other rivers such as the Zeya River and Shilka River</p>
<p>and the Aigun River are interconnected and can be used for short-distance aviation between Heihe, Blagoveshchensk, and Boli. As for aviation, it has always been lacking. In the summer of this year, the Soviet government planned to establish civil aviation, stipulating the route between Moscow and Irkutsk as the first air route, and the route between Irkutsk and Vladivostok as the second air route, both of which are planned to be established in the shortest possible time. It is now reported that the section between Irkutsk and Vladivostok is actively underway, and construction began on June 15th of this year. It is also reported that a route will be established between Siberia and Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky in the future, so that the coastal area and the cities of Kamchatka can be connected with the central region of the Far East. This is truly a great construction in the aviation industry. The national civil aviation routes of the Soviet Union are increasing daily. It is reported that in 1930, they were only 24,762 kilometers long, and in 1931, they</p>
<p>increased to 221,800 kilometers. If the plan proceeds as scheduled, it is expected to increase to 654,740 kilometers this year. Since its implementation, it has only been half a year, and the achievements are remarkable. It is estimated that mail transport has fulfilled 135% of the planned target, and cargo transport has fulfilled 149% of the planned target.</p>
<h3>Stamp Inspection Begins</h3>
<p>▲ Starting October 15th</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce issued a notice to all trade associations in the city yesterday, stating that it had received a letter from the Shangbao Stamp Tax Bureau stating that the bureau is scheduled to begin stamp inspection on October 15th, which has been approved by the Jiangsu Stamp and Wine Tax Bureau. In addition to issuing a public notice and sending separate letters to the municipal Public Security Bureau and the Shangbao County Government to instruct the public security sub-bureaus in each district to assist in the inspection, please inform your respective trade associations of the matter.</p>
<h3>Pudong Telephone Cable to be Repaired</h3>
<p>▲ Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities Has Issued a Permit</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that since the telephone cable inside the Huangpu River was damaged, telephone service between Shanghai and Pudong has been disrupted for nearly a week, causing great inconvenience to users. Yesterday (the 8th), it was learned that the Shanghai Telephone Company had consulted with the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities and obtained a permit, and repairs will be carried out within two or three days.</p>

<h3>Soy and Rice Merchants Guild Petitions City Government to Dissolve Lianyi Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Soy and Rice Merchants Guild yesterday submitted a document to the Shanghai Municipal Government, stating: The petition is to address the assembling of thugs, wanton acts of violence, and coercion. We respectfully request that you, the esteemed magistrate, severely punish them according to the law in order to maintain law and order. Our guild established the Nanshi Rice Wharf to facilitate the berthing of rice boats from various regions. The guild's members also measure rice in bushels at the wharf. Since its establishment, everything has been peaceful. Recently, a so-called "Shanghai South Rice Carriers Lianyi Association" has been interfering, causing terror among the measurers, resulting in two work stoppages. The guild has repeatedly petitioned the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau to strictly order a halt to this behavior and provide adequate protection, all on file. The Social Affairs Bureau approved the petition, ordering the measurers to resume work immediately in order to maintain the food supply and sanctioning strict punishment. In accordance with the order, the guild persuaded the measurers to resume work today. Unexpectedly, at around 8:00 AM yesterday, while the measurers were working, Zhou Qiaosheng, a standing committee member of the Lianyi Association, gathered about fifty or sixty thugs, led them, and swarmed in, waving more than ten white flags, creating a menacing atmosphere. They immediately jumped onto the rice boats and forcibly dispersed the measurers. Four patrol officers at the wharf witnessed this and tried to dissuade them, but they were met with violence. The officers were held down and beaten, their uniforms torn, and their bodies injured. Passersby, indignant, blew whistles. The nearby police station, hearing the alarm, rushed to suppress the situation and apprehended three thugs who were being escorted away when the thugs regrouped and attempted to snatch them back. Fortunately, a large group of officers arrived and apprehended six more people, who were all taken to the First District First Precinct and then to the Public Security Bureau for detention. The Lianyi Association has repeatedly humiliated the measurers employed by our guild, and now they have assembled thugs to carry out their actions, even assaulting the patrol officers dispatched by the Shanghai Public Security Bureau and attempting to forcibly snatch them away. This is utterly lawless. Under this atmosphere of terror, the measurers dare not continue working. Therefore, we urgently appeal to your office to promptly order the dissolution of the Shanghai South Rice Carriers Lianyi Association, severely arrest the masterminds, bring them to justice, and prosecute the thugs in custody. Furthermore, provide effective protection for the measurers employed by our guild. With utmost urgency, we await your command.

<h3>Transfer Prisoners to Build Highways</h3>
<p>▲ Ministry of Justice Consults Jiangsu Provincial Government</p>
<p>The Ministry of Justice sent a letter to the Jiangsu Provincial Government yesterday, stating that the prisons in Jiangsu Province are extremely crowded, the workshops are insufficient, and many prisoners are idle, so it is urgent to promote external labor to provide relief. Moreover, the construction of highways in various counties of Jiangsu Province is underway, requiring a large number of workers. It is proposed to allocate prisoners from various counties for work, so that prisoners are not idle and the highways can be completed. Please instruct the Construction Department to determine the number of miles of highways to be built in each county in order to send personnel to negotiate. It is estimated that about 10,000 to 20,000 prisoners can be assigned to external labor.</p>
<h3>Caohéjing Prisoners Imprisoned in Taicang</h3>
<p>▲ Due to Overcrowding in the Second Prison</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Second Prison in Caohejing, West Shanghai, has recently been overcrowded and cannot accommodate all the prisoners. The prison officials reported the situation to the High Court, and the court instructed that 100 prisoners be transferred to the Taicang County Prison. Therefore, the prison officials dispatched more than 20 armed police officers to escort 70 male prisoners and 30 female prisoners to the Anting Station on the Shanghai-Nanjing slow train. They then transferred to two small boats and set off for the Taicang County Prison that day, where the prison officials checked in and imprisoned them.</p>

<h3>High Court Prosecutor's Office Pays Attention to Criminal Cases in Shanghai</h3>
<p>▲ Instructs Local Prosecutor's Office to Investigate and Prosecute Strictly</p>
<p>The Jiangsu High Court Prosecutor's Office believes that Shanghai is a hotbed of evil, especially in cases of abduction and enticement of women, prostitution, rape, and the establishment of gambling dens, all of which originate in Shanghai. According to the powers of the prosecutor, the prosecutor has the right to report and investigate all cases of criminal law. Therefore, it is specifically instructed not to lose its power. The local prosecutor's office has complied with the order and instructed Deputy Police Chief Chen and all bailiffs to investigate and prosecute all criminals in the Chinese area. It also announced that if the public has any opinions to report to the court, they will definitely be dealt with.</p>
<h3>Fourth District Public Security Bureau Uncovers Counterfeit Currency Offenders</h3>
<p>At 2:30 PM the day before yesterday, Police Officer Zhang Guorui from Post No. 32 of the Zhongxing Road Police Station in the Fourth District Public Security Bureau received reports from Liu Desheng, the owner of the Yisheng cigarette and paper shop at No. 108 Zhongxing Road, and Wang Zaozi, the owner of the Tonghe cigarette and paper shop at No. 806 Yongxing Road, who had apprehended two offenders using counterfeit currency. After bringing them to the police station for questioning, one of them, Wang Deqing, 30 years old, and another named Shunxin, 38 years old, both from Fujian and came to Shanghai from Nanjing. Nine yuan and 38 jiao in silver currency were found in their pockets, all of which were exchanged with counterfeit coins. 2 jiao large coins were found. 18 counterfeit coins were found inside the pants. There were Yuan Shikai coins, Sun Yat-sen coins, and large coins. They were immediately sent to the Fourth District. Someone 39 years old from Hubei province was accused of exchanging counterfeit coins. At the time, he did not notice. After they left, he realized it and chased them to Yongxing Small Road and saw five or six of them gathering together before dispersing. He followed them to Wang Zhuzi's Tonghe cigarette and paper shop on Yongxing Road and saw the owner exchange one yuan with the female owner Wang Fang. After Wang and others bought and ate hot taro from a taro stall there, he went to Tonghe to ask Fang if the exchanged coin was good. She took it out and asked someone to check, and only then did they realize it was counterfeit. The counterfeit coins are all copper and silver, and are no different from real ones. Their weight is also the same, and the sound is the same as real coins, so outsiders will be deceived. Wang Zhuzi, 39 years old from Huizhou province, said that the defendants came to exchange counterfeit coins in the afternoon, but he was not at home. His wife did not recognize silver coins, and only when Liu Desheng arrived did he realize it was counterfeit. Recently, there have been many people mixing in counterfeit coins, and many shops have been deceived. Wang Deqing confessed that he farmed in Nanjing. He arrived in Shanghai this morning (the day before yesterday) and planned to return to his hometown. He had 15 yuan in paper money and exchanged 12 yuan for silver coins at the train station in Nanjing, leaving 3 yuan. One yuan was counterfeit and three yuan was silver. Su Shunxin confessed that he worked as a porter in Nanjing and had 8 yuan on him. Wang Deqing deposited 5 yuan with him, for a total of 13 yuan. He did not know anything else. The silver coins were exchanged from a Wenzhou person in Xiaguan, Nanjing. After the interrogating officer verified the confession, it was found that it is not uncommon to use this kind</p>
<p>of deception on rural folks, and they all claim to have exchanged the coins at the Nanjing station and did not recognize the real or fake coins as a cover. Moreover, since the defendants were traveling a long distance from Beijing to Shanghai to Fujian, why did they have no luggage or temporary residence? Why were the nine yuan in silver coins placed in the outer pocket, and the eighteen yuan in counterfeit coins hidden in their pants? It is clear that their words are deceitful. If they are not strictly investigated, it will not be enough to deter evil. However, the case involves the use of counterfeit currency, which falls under criminal jurisdiction, so it was ruled to be sent to the Public Security Bureau for strict investigation.</p>
<h3>Li Minghui Participates in Road Carnival</h3>
<p>Famous playwright Zheng Zhengqiu, movie star Hu Die, and all the male and female stars of the Mingxing Film Company have participated in the New World Road Exhibition Carnival for two days. During these two days, the front of New World has been crowded with people and vehicles, reaching a climax. After the January 28th Incident, New World was used as a barracks, and a somber atmosphere shrouded West Nanjing Road for nearly a year. Now, thanks to the road construction movement of the Road Association, it has returned to its former prosperity. Zheng and others perform at the Xinghua Theater, with performance times after 8:00 PM every night. However, viewers entering New World must first occupy the theater, so in the past two days, the theater was already full before 3:00 PM. Today is the last day, and it is also National Day, so it is expected that even more people will come to watch. From tomorrow, all the male and female stars of the Tianyi Film Company will take over the voluntary performances for three days. The program includes the song "Hua Nong Ying" sung by Chen Yumei, Xuan Jinglin, and Hu Shan, which is the most outstanding. There will also be the singing of famous songs by Li Minghui, a pioneer of song and dance and a movie star who recently returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong and joined Tianyi Film Company.</p>
<h3>Woman Beaten After Reconciliation and Returning Home</h3>
<p>▲ Files Criminal Charges Against Husband's Brother and Maternal Uncles</p>
<p>Li Shen Yuezhen, a woman living in a simple house in the countryside of Lijia Ku, Xiaoshadu, has been having disagreements with her husband, Li Zhangsheng, which often lead to quarrels. This is because Li has taken a concubine, causing him to mistreat Yuezhen, and her mother-in-law is also the same. Yuezhen felt great pain living in her husband's house. In early August, she returned to her mother's house in Ningbo and hired a lawyer to file for divorce with the First Special District Local Court. Later, through mediation, they reconciled. On the morning of August 20th, at 8:00 AM, Yuezhen had just entered the courtyard of the Li family when she was tied up with ropes by her husband's brother, Li Huoquan, and her maternal uncles, Yao Shenghe, and beaten on the legs with firewood. She was injured, fell to the ground, and cried for help. Neighbors reported the incident to the Gordon Road Police Station by telephone, and the detectives were instructed to investigate. However, Yuezhen had already been untied by someone. The detectives, believing it to be a family dispute, reported the situation to the police chief. Yuezhen returned to her mother's house and hired lawyer Han Li to file a criminal charge of assault against Li Huoquan and Yao Shenghe in the First Special District Court. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Zhen presided over the hearing in the Second Criminal Court. The plaintiff, Li Yuezhen, complained that the two defendants, without asking any questions, tied her up with ropes. Li Huoquan beat her legs with firewood, and Yao Shenghe punched and kicked her. Although the neighbors witnessed it, they were afraid of her mother-in-law's ferocity and did not dare to dissuade them. No one is willing to testify. Only the vegetable vendor Yu Zhang can testify today. Zhang complained that she did not know either party. On that day, she happened to go to the Li residence to collect the money for vegetables and saw the plaintiff's hands and feet tied up. Yao Shenghe said that he had to beat her legs, and Li Huoquan beat her with firewood. Li Huoquan claimed that he worked as a worker in the Robert and White Light Bulb Factory on Love Lane, entering the factory at 6:00 AM every morning and leaving at 6:00 PM every afternoon, so how could he have the time to beat the plaintiff? Yao Shenghe also denied the assault, saying that he worked at the Edison Light Bulb Factory, a US company, and went to the factory at 7:00 AM every morning and did not get off work until 7:00 PM. He requested that the court conduct a detailed investigation to clarify the truth. The plaintiff's lawyer claimed that the court's forensic doctor had already examined the victim and confirmed that her legs were indeed injured by a stick. After Judge Wu verified the confessions, he ordered everyone to withdraw and wait for the next hearing to verify the evidence.</p>
<h3>Girl Holding Baby Snatched by Robbers</h3>
<p>▲ Although the Robber Was Arrested, the Baby Is Still Missing</p>
<p>Zhang Arong, who lives on Guangdong Road, ordered his six-year-old daughter, Da Nv, to hold his infant son, Bingsheng, who was less than one year old, outside to play at 2:00 PM on the 23rd of last month to keep him from crying at home. Da Nv was walking along the road outside her home, holding her brother. Suddenly, a robber passed by and, seeing that Da Nv was young and easy to deceive, used a few copper coins as bait to lure her to a secluded place near Fuzhou Road and Yunnan Road. Another accomplice was lying in wait there. The first robber snatched the child from Da Nv and handed him to the second robber, who then ran away. Da Nv ran home in a panic and told her mother, who searched everywhere, but the child was nowhere to be found. Yesterday, Zhang Arong and his daughter were walking in the French Concession when they unexpectedly encountered the first robber. He managed to lure the robber to No. 341 Guangdong Road and reported it to the Old Zhabei Police Station, who sent a detective to arrest the robber. He confessed that his name was Shi Renchuan, from Wuxi. His accomplice's name was Zhu A'si, who is now hiding in the jurisdiction of the Second Section of the South Shanghai District with his wife, Zhu Mi. The child was handed over to Zhu at the time. In addition to detaining Shi, the police chief ordered the investigating detective to rush to the police station in that jurisdiction and send additional detectives to arrest Zhu and his wife at their address. However, the child Bingsheng has not yet been found. The police have applied to the First Special District Local Court for a document to transfer Zhu and his wife to their jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The detective has been ordered to transfer Zhu and his wife to the court for interrogation, along with Shi Renchuan. It is still under close investigation whether the child has been sold or hidden.</p>
<h3>Factory Machine Entangles Female Worker's Braid</h3>
<p>A-Mei, a 16-year-old girl from Changzhou and a leading worker in the fine yarn room of the Yunzao Yong'an Yarn Factory on Wusong Road, accidentally had her braid caught by the machine's belt while working yesterday morning.

The girl was injured, fell to the ground, and her head was covered in blood. The factory arranged for a car to take her to the Shanghai Tou Hospital for treatment, and her life may be in danger.</p>

<h3>Two Passengers Drown from Ferry Accident</h3>
<p>A local man, Jiang Guofa, 31 years old, made his living operating a rocking ferry. Yesterday morning, around 9:00 AM, Jiang picked up 22 passengers at Dongjiadu in Nanshi and set off directly toward Pudong. When the ferry reached the middle of the river, while passing the Huacheng firewood and coal boat anchored there, a Ningbo boat owned by Gao Changfa sped from north to south. Unable to avoid it, the Ningbo boat rammed the ferry amidships with a loud crash. The impact shook the ferry, and four passengers, Wang Jinlin, Gu Qiufen, Xu Changbao, and a Mr. Jia whose name is unknown, were thrown into the river. Seeing the major accident they had caused, the people on both boats quickly tried to rescue the victims. Wang and Gu were rescued from the water and were fortunate to survive. However, Xu Changbao and Mr. Jia disappeared after falling into the water, presumably becoming companions of the river god.</p>

<p>Letter to the Editor</p>
<p>Dear Sir, I recently read an article in your newspaper's fourth page, local news section, titled "Centenarian Mother Celebrates Birthday Today," which stated that the location of Ms. Gu Yao's birthday celebration was in her youngest son Gu Jiatang's new Western-style house on Yuyuan Road. This is a great contradiction to the facts. Jiatang's biological mother passed away many years ago. Ms. Gu Yao has her own son. Why would you attribute this to someone else? I think there must have been a mistake in the interview. I am writing this letter specifically to request a correction. October 9th, Gu Jiatang, Caojiabao, West Shanghai.</p>

Chairman Chen Guofu gave a speech, the gist of which was that the Society had been established for four years, the first annual meeting was held in Shanghai, the second in Hangzhou, and now the third was being held in Suzhou. In recent years, the cooperative business in Jiangsu has been very developed. The cooperative movement in China started in the eighth year of the Republic [1919]. According to current statistics, 2,763 cooperative societies have been established, four of which are sales cooperatives, one insurance cooperative, and two supply cooperatives. According to statistics, there are 81,550 members of credit cooperatives, 3,597 members of utilization cooperatives, 1,607 members of purchasing cooperatives, 317 members of supply cooperatives, 1,913 members of sales cooperatives, and 55 members of insurance cooperatives, for a total of 98,778 members. But compared with other countries, China has the fewest members. The Society's work in recent years, such as publishing books and the Cooperative Series, has achieved considerable results. Qinghai has put much effort into promoting the cooperative business, and the cooperative counselors also go to various places to investigate the actual situation from time to time. The cooperative movement is very much needed in China, and the cooperative movement in Jinan, Guangdong, and Guangxi has developed much more than before. There are also many cooperative societies in Suzhou. The previous achievements have been reported in great detail, such as rural economy, cooperative methods, etc. He hoped that the people of the whole country would cooperate together, etc. Then speeches were given by Wang Qi, representative of the Central Government, He Yushu, representative of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, Zou Jing, magistrate of Wuxian County, and Zhang Yipeng, a Suzhou gentry.

<h3>Donghua Wins the Queling Zhi Cup Again After Defeating the Western Police</h3>
<p>▲ Five to Zero, Western Police Completely Defeated</p>
<p>▲ Fifteen Thousand People Watched, Cheering Wildly</p>
<p>Yesterday, Donghua and the Western Police played their second Queling Zhi Cup match at the China Baseball Field. The first half remained scoreless. In the second half, 15 minutes in, the Western Police's right forward, Huisiwu, accidentally scored a goal for Donghua, starting the scoring record. The entire stadium erupted in cheers. Donghua's momentum surged, and they successively scored three goals. Later, the Western Police's right inside defender, Sude, also scored a goal for his own team, making the score even, which was truly amusing. In the end, Donghua won decisively with a score of five to zero, causing over ten thousand spectators to jump for joy. From then on, the Queling Zhi Cup belonged to Donghua.</p>
<p>▲ Lack of Interest in Performance</p>
<p>Yesterday's performance by both teams lacked excitement, so the interest was subdued. The game felt loose, and the movements were slow. In terms of form, Donghua was indeed superior to the Western Police, with numerous scoring opportunities, but unfortunately, few shots were accurate or were saved. On the Western Police side, neither offense nor defense was impressive, especially the defense, which was negligent with many breaches, often facing danger. Although the forwards were brave, Donghua's Li Ning and Feng Yunyou were like two iron gates, impenetrable. Coupled with Zhou Xianyan's stable goalkeeping, like Mount Tai, and the valiant resistance of the other players, the Western Police could not shake them.</p>
<p>▲ Donghua's Coordination Shows Skill</p>
<p>Donghua's performance by each player was outstanding, and their coordination was particularly skillful. Observing Donghua's previous victory, it relied on clever short passes. And yesterday's consecutive victory was also due to their effective teamwork, with the front and back seamlessly connected, making their formation very solid, leaving the Western Police running around in vain, unable to find a grip. The three goals scored were very clear. On the Western Police side, their coordination was still decent, but individual performances were slightly inferior. The two goals they scored themselves proved the lack of targeting on their end.</p>
<p>▲ Western Police Under Pressure for Ten Minutes</p>
<p>At 2:45 PM, Donghua, wearing red jerseys, entered the field and warmed up briefly. The Western Police also appeared in uniform. After a foreign film company filmed a sound movie, He Chunjie ordered the game to begin. The Western Police kicked off, but the attack was not aggressive. Donghua immediately counterattacked, charging left and right with great spirit. Chen Yutian tested his shooting ability first, aiming at the goal, but the shot was saved by the goalkeeper. Jia Qiu also launched shots successively. The Western Police's goal was surrounded by Donghua players, but none of them scored. Once, Wan Xianghua passed the ball in front of the goal, and the goalkeeper fumbled the ball, which fell in front of the goal, a very dangerous situation. It was an excellent opportunity for Donghua, but no one charged forward, and the ball was saved. Within ten minutes, the Western Police had several offensive opportunities.</p>
<p>▲ Continued Pressure, Still No Success</p>
<p>The Western Police attacked once, with Turner repeatedly penetrating the defense, but it was difficult to find a chance to score. Therefore, Donghua always held the upper hand. Inside the Western Police's zone, dangerous balls were frequent. Chen Hongguang dribbled the ball in, broke through three barriers, and drove straight in, almost reaching the goal, but he kicked the ball too far, and the goalkeeper came forward to clear it. Yutian sent out a corner kick, and Li Yichen headed the ball well, but it landed in the goalkeeper's hands, failing to gain an advantage. Later, the Western Police's Huogen Sheng single-handedly dribbled the ball in, and as he approached the goal, just as he was about to shoot, Li Ning knocked him away, turning danger into safety. The first half ended with both sides scoreless.</p>
<p>▲ Donghua Wins a Goal Without Effort</p>
<p>After the break, Donghua had the advantage of kicking off and went straight to the Western Police's fortress, but there was no opportunity to score. The Western Police counterattacked, and Donghua's defense was not as comfortable as in the first half, now facing enemies on all sides. Turner shot, but Zhou Xianyan saved it. Okelei sent a beautiful corner kick, leading to a melee in front of the goal, and Donghua almost had an accident. Gaxu used a long shot, which was very fierce, but Zhou blocked it again and sent it forward. Wan Xianghua forced a corner kick, which was taken by Jia Qiu. The kick was excellent, and Yichen rushed up to head it, with very fast movements. The ball bounced back off the crossbar, and Hongguang shot again, but it was ineffective. At this time, the situation in front of the Western Police's goal was very urgent. Li Yichen also got the ball and attacked the goal, but the ball went just to the right of the goal. The Western Police's right forward, Huisiwu, intended to hook the ball out, but he misjudged and kicked the ball fiercely into the net. The entire stadium erupted in cheers. Donghua unexpectedly won a goal, to their great delight.</p>
<p>▲ Three Goals in Ten Minutes</p>
<p>From then on, Donghua's spirits were greatly boosted, and they charged horizontally and vertically, unstoppable. Jia Qiu replaced Wan Xianghua and sent out a corner kick, which landed on the right corner of the goal. Both sides fought fiercely, and Yutian suddenly fired a cold shot, scoring a goal in the crowd. In less than three minutes, Li Yichen attacked the goal again. The ball was blocked by the goalkeeper, but Wan Xianghua sent it in front of the goal, and Chen Yutian touched it, and Chen Hongguang powerfully shot, and the ball entered the net again, with extremely agile and clear movements. Later, due to Wan Xianghua's cross, Chen Hongguang headed in another goal. In total, Donghua scored three consecutive goals in ten minutes, with a majestic momentum, reaching its peak.</p>
<p>▲ Xiao De Scores an Own Goal</p>
<p>At this point, the Western Police's military appearance was scattered, and their offense and defense were chaotic. Li Yichen dribbled the ball forward, but was blocked by the Western Police's inside defender, Sude. Xiao De intended to pass the ball to the goalkeeper to kick it out, but the goalkeeper had already run out. Unexpectedly, Xiao De used too much force, and the ball soared over the goalkeeper's head and into the goal. He scored an own goal, a truly rare event in history, which was quite amusing. After that, the Western Police launched a counterattack once, and Okelei and Ke each shot once, but both were ineffective. When the Western Police's goalkeeper ran out, Li Yichen shot at the empty goal, but missed. After ninety minutes, Donghua won a total of five goals. The lineup of both sides is listed as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Donghua</p>
<p>Tu Kaiyuan Wan Xianghua</p>
<p>Li Ning Chen Hongguang</p>
<p>Zhou Xianyan Feng Yunyou Li Yichen</p>
<p>Guan Xun'an Chen Jiaqiu</p>
<p>Wu Youliang Chen Yutian</p>

<h3>Youyou Ties with Shanghai Team in the Last Two Minutes</h3>
<p>丨Three to Three in Group A Match丨</p>
<p>▲ Shanghai Team Scores Three Goals First</p>
<p>▲ Youyou Also Returns Three Goals</p>
<p>The Youyou Football Team, under extremely adverse circumstances, conceded three goals to the Shanghai Westerners team, and then successively regained three goals, resulting in a tie, which is extremely commendable. This was a scene from a Westerners Association Group A match, held at 3 PM at the China Football Field. The lineup of the two teams is recorded on the left:</p>
<p>▲ Youyou Team Lineup</p>
<p>Zhu Shengfa</p>
<p>Lu Shifang Xi Qiaosheng</p>
<p>Liang Guan Qian Yaobin Hu Youcheng</p>
<p>Zhu Qiu Dong Xiaopei</p>
<p>Rao Huisheng Shi Jinsheng Shen Baigui</p>
<p>▲ Shanghai Team Lineup</p>
<p>Moer</p>
<p>Sitokeshitel Jinbo</p>
<p>Kanaier Xuefu Xinkelai</p>
<p>Fa Ping Tuiluo Molei</p>
<p>Baikeside</p>
<p>▲ Adverse Situation Controls Youyou</p>
<p>The China Football Field is small, and the Shanghai team used their powerful long passes. After two or three transfers, they reached the Youyou goal. Youyou was confined to this adverse situation in the first half. Most of the balls revolved around Youyou's territory, and they suffered heavy pressure. Within thirty minutes, the Shanghai team scored three times in a row, Jinbo scoring two goals and Xinkelai scoring one. Fortunately, they broke through the difficulties later. Hu Youcheng also returned two goals. The first half ended with a score of three to two. The second half was a melee with no gains or losses. In the last two minutes, Zhu Shengfa relied on a goal to achieve a tie.</p>
<h3>The Team's Skills Still Lack Cooperation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai team are all veteran players, with many famous players from inter-port matches. Youyou is new to Group A, and this result is commendable. The most outstanding player on the team is the veteran Rao Huisheng. Although old, he is still as majestic as before, blocking the way like a pillar. Liang's goalkeeping is acceptable, but the two players on the left and right of the midfield are slightly inferior, repeatedly allowing the enemy to break in. Since there are many gaps, it is easy for the enemy to advance. The forwards are therefore trapped in discontinuity. Among the five forwards, the two wings are weak, unable to control the ball and command as desired. The three central forwards can still move, but in short, cooperation needs to be practiced. The Shanghai team had a wonderful first half and fell into fatigue in the second half, with nothing particularly outstanding. Xinkelai is still worth watching.</p>
<h3>Three Goals Conceded in Thirty Minutes</h3>
<p>The Shanghai team started the attack first. Although they immediately advanced, Youyou also intercepted and counterattacked, but in a flash, the Shanghai team advanced from the left and right, and their momentum was still dangerous, and the precarious situation did not disappear. Misfortune was seen immediately. Jinbo dribbled the ball straight in, and Shi Jinsheng failed to stop him. The central defense was breached, and he rushed straight in and kicked the ball in. At that time, it was only five minutes. Youyou was still in a dangerous situation. Two minutes after losing the goal, the Westerners came again. Rao Huisheng kicked the ball out, and Baikeside passed the corner kick. It did not deviate and went into the side. Xinkelai lightly passed to the left, and Jinbo scored the second goal. Youyou was zero to two. Occasionally, they launched a counterattack, but it was ultimately ineffective. Xinkelai also dribbled the ball near the goal, and Liang Guanju wanted to save it by the post, but the ball had already bounced in. In these thirty minutes, Youyou suffered three consecutive losses, but they were not discouraged.</p>
<h3>Not Willing to Yield, the Center Forward Scores in Succession</h3>
<p>This is why the Shanghai Westerners team did not succeed. They only advanced and did not care about the rear defense. And in the experience of these twenty or thirty minutes, they thought Youyou's forwards were nothing more than this. Youyou's opportunity came. Dong Xiaopei and Hu Youcheng went side by side. In front of the Shanghai goal, only Sitokeshitel was defending alone. Dong dodged Shi and passed to Hu, who kicked and shot urgently, hitting the net. There were still ten minutes left in the first half. Youyou attacked again. Zhu Shengfa advanced along the left side. Fa Ping came to block him. Zhu passed to the center, and Hu Youcheng shot it in again. In less than two minutes, the first half ended with a score of three to two.</p>
<h3>Draw in the Last Two Minutes</h3>
<p>Youyou went from zero to three to two to three, giving rise to hope. At the beginning of the second half, they attacked the enemy's goal immediately. Shen Baigui hooked a ball, but the goal was empty, and he did not shoot it in, which was a pity. The melee did not distinguish between victory and defeat, only seeing back and forth. In the forty minutes, there were many things that were a pity for Youyou. There were more than ten times when they could have scored but did not. Fortunately, they did not disappoint. In the last two minutes, Zhu Shengfa kicked a leg urgently on the left wing, which was powerful and spectacular, flying into the net and drawing the game three to three.</p>
<h3>John's Assists Righteous Army Basketball Game</h3>
<p>▲ Medical School Wins Against Arts and Sciences School</p>
<p>▲ The Final Result Was Fifty-Three to Fifty</p>
<p>The basketball game initiated by students of the Medical School of St. John's University to support the Northeast Righteous Army has already been played twice. Yesterday (October 6th) was the final match of the game, between the St. John's Medical School and the Arts and Sciences School. The Arts and Sciences School possessed the basic team members of the St. John's University basketball team that shook Shanghai last year, such as Chen Xianglong, Wu Youlin, and Chen Jingxing, and the entire team cooperated extremely well. The Medical School was all veteran players, such as Diao Youguo, Hou Xuemin, Ling Huiyang, Cao Fukang, and Cao Yu, etc. It was a case of meeting a worthy opponent, and the competition was fierce. After the start of the game, the scores of the two teams went up and down. When the first half was about to end, the Arts and Sciences School's score suddenly increased, and the first half ended with a score of twenty-one to fifteen in favor of the Arts and Sciences School. Because the Medical School lost too many points in the first half, they worked hard to counterattack, and in an instant, the scores of the two teams were equal. When the second half ended, they each still had forty-one points. They fought for another five minutes in overtime, and each scored two more points, ending the game in a tie. They extended the game again for five minutes, and the Medical School finally won with a score of fifty-three to fifty. It was heard from the person in charge, Mr. Cao Yuping, that the total revenue from this Northeast Army support game was more than two hundred yuan. This amount was almost entirely obtained from the students of St. John's Middle School and the St. John's Youth Association Middle School. A detailed account will be announced soon. Mr. Cao also said that this income will be remitted to the Northeast in full, and no expenses will be taken from it at all. He also said that although the income is not abundant, he sincerely hopes that domestic sports figures will hear the news and rise up together, and the results in the future will definitely be considerable.</p>

<h3>The Rampant Rise in Foreign Exchange Rates Intensifies</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the rise in foreign exchange rates in the market was turbulent. The difference in interest rates within a week was very large, and recently it has intensified. It felt slightly stable the day before, but yesterday the rise was particularly strong, with the morning market at 7 qian and 8.5 li, and the afternoon market continuing to rise by 1 li to 7 qian and 9.5 li, resulting in a total increase of 3.125 li compared to the previous day's afternoon market. With the appetite of merchants on the rise, the rise in foreign exchange rates is unstoppable. The amount of remittances made was 635,000 in the morning market and 225,000 in the afternoon market. Only 40,000 banknotes were exchanged in the afternoon market. Merchants still had over 800,000 yuan in silver for export. The silver discount rate was 4% in the morning market and 2.5% in the afternoon market. Qianzhuang and Yinhang had over 23 million in single receipts and disbursements, and Yanggong had over 4.7 million in single receipts and disbursements. Small qianzhuang transactions were over 500,000. The early market price of small Jiangnan silver was 6 qian and 8.5 li, and the afternoon market price was 6 qian and 1 fen, an increase of 1.5 li compared to the previous day. The trading volume was 4,000 jiao in the morning market and 6,000 jiao in the afternoon market. The early market price of small Guangdong silver was 6 qian and 1.5 li, and the afternoon market price was 6 qian and 3 li, not only exceeding the 6 qian mark, but also far exceeding it, with a difference of 3 li, so the exchange rate was also varied. The trading volume was 85,000 jiao in the early market and 70,000 jiao in the afternoon market. The price of copper coins returning to Chang was 500 wen, which was 423,500,000 wen.</p>
<h3>Several Main Reasons for the Recent Rise in Interest Rates</h3>
<p>Since April and May, the Shanghai port has been flooded with silver dollars, and there has been an oversupply every day. At the beginning of summer and autumn, commerce was depressed, and agricultural products had not yet entered the market. Although there was a slight outlet for foreign exchange due to the spring and summer floods and poor harvests, it was far less than in previous years. Therefore, the disastrous fall in interest rates this year is unprecedented in history. The smooth sales in various ports are due to several reasons, which are described below: (1) In the North, Tianjin, Fengtian, Qingdao, Yantai, and other places have been affected by the war since September 18th. Recently, as autumn grain crops have entered the market one after another, the demand for funds has become more frequent. (2) In the South, Shantou, Xiamen, and the two Guangs, when they were initially paid at the end of last year, they transported foreign exchange to Shanghai one after another to offset their accounts, causing the funds in these ports to be exhausted. Now that the market has slightly improved, there is insufficient financial liquidity, and they have raised the interest rate high, far exceeding the Shanghai rate (it is said that there is more than 1 fen of profit). As a result, they have been ordering from Shanghai one after another. (3) Hankou and the Yangtze River have always had more foreign exchange flowing in than flowing out. Now, because the Beijing and Hangzhou mints have stopped minting for a long time, the market demand for grain use has increased, so they also need to purchase and transport foreign exchange from Shanghai. Moreover, the uses in Hunan and Sichuan also depend on Hankou, and Hankou must obtain it from Shanghai. (4) In the interior, Tongzhou, Chongming, Hai'an, and Ningbo, Yao, and other places, cotton has entered the market, and the use of foreign exchange is the same every year, so there must be a large-scale replenishment, so they have also joined the rush to purchase. (5) In this street, in addition to the reserve funds that cannot be circulated, the banks are also actively buying and selling other surplus funds. Therefore, the recent rise in interest rates and the旺盛 trend are natural facts, and it is also because all places are meeting at the right time.</p>
<h3>The Gold Market Was Idle and Soft Last Week</h3>
<p>Last week, the gold market rose and then fell, a reaction after five consecutive weeks of gains. However, the market initially had drastic changes, and then it was calm. The daily difference was only three or four taels, and the buying and selling from all parties was still idle. The market opened at the beginning of the week, rising 4 taels and 3 qian, to 736 taels and 3 qian, and then rising to 37 taels. It was said that the silver market had shrunk, and it was reported that the Dalian draft had fallen sharply. The Dalian gang tended to sell to Japanese banks, so the banks immediately sold US exchange, causing the price to suddenly become loose and abundant. Suddenly, a frenzy arose in the market, and large accounts flocked to sell. It was heard that the Central Bank sold along with them, and rumors of the poisoning of a certain important person in Peiping made people more tired. It plunged more than 10 taels, with the tendency of a river going downhill. Fortunately, the Central Bank absorbed cash very strongly, so the price was pulled up. However, the minimum price suddenly fell to 723 taels and 5 qian the next morning, and then the buyers moved and turned upward again. The overseas silver market also had different trends, causing the Shanghai exchange to become slightly complicated, and the gold price hovered around 730 taels. In the end, it seemed to be secretly weakening, and neither the long nor short sides had much volume. Because of the Double Tenth National Day, the banks closed, and the Gold Exchange also had to take two days off on Sundays, so everyone was cautious and did not dare to do much to prevent changes after the market opened. The result was 728 taels and 1 qian, a decrease of 3 taels and 9 qian compared to the previous Saturday, and the opening and closing prices differed by a fall of 8 taels and 2 qian. As for the price of the spot goods, the initial price was about 727 taels, and later it was 31 taels and 7 qian 5. After that, it was 270 taels. The Central Bank absorbed a total of more than 2,000 bars, but the bare bars were flat, calculated as adding 10 taels according to the spot gold price. As for the international silver market, the overall situation was still flat, and the local English gold was half a grade longer (125), US gold was 25, while internal shillings were 125 longer, and US gold was 1875 longer. The Huashang Gold Industry had different opinions, and the Central Bank sold positions, mostly hedging cash. Each gold shop also had hedging transactions, and the settlement price was initially held at more than 70 taels, and then calculated at less than 70 taels. The Dalian Gang still held a multi-position, but the Guang Gang Hengxing short position did not move. The amount of Gold Exchange bars recently exceeded 24,000. Foreign exchange transactions were frequent. The UK dollar fell by 25, and the US dollar fell by 5625 against the UK dollar. Now, the high and low prices of English and American silver and exchange rates and gold prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Type Highest Lowest Compared to Previous Saturday</p>
<p>Large Bar Recent 17 pence 875 17 pence 875 Unchanged</p>
<p>Large Bar Distant 17 pence 9375 17 pence 75 Decreased 0625</p>

<p>Bombay City 56 rupees 01 55 rupees 15 Unchanged</p>
<p>English Exchange Rate 1 shilling 9 pence 1 shilling 8 pence 75 Longer 125</p>
<p>US Exchange Rate 30 yuan 025 29 yuan 875 Longer 25</p>
<p>Spot Gold Price 727 taels 723 taels 5 qian Fell 3 taels 9 qian</p>
<h3>Securities: Bond Prices Fluctuated Last Week</h3>
<p>Last week, the bond market at the Shanghai Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw quiet spot trading, with a total turnover of only 80,200 yuan for the entire week. The futures market was also less active than before, and market sentiment was subdued. The November futures had been open for trading for several days, but aside from some trading in salt tax bonds on Monday, there was almost no activity throughout the week. Therefore, the only actively traded contract last week was the October futures. A review of the daily trading volume showed that the first day of the week was relatively active, accounting for 4.9 million yuan. The remaining days mostly saw trading volumes around 2.3 million yuan, with the weekend being the quietest, with only slightly over 1.4 million yuan. The total turnover for the entire week was 15.905 million yuan, a decrease of 1.77 million yuan compared to the previous week. The political situation and diplomatic landscape were very calm, and market sentiment was one of observation. Supply and demand remained balanced. As a result, compared to the previous week, spot prices, excluding the current period's principal and interest, generally saw slight increases. In the futures market, only the "Entire Six" bond rose by 0.95 yuan, while other bonds saw slight declines, mostly in the range of 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. Given the current environment, it is unlikely that the bond market will see much development in the near future. The following is a list of the high and low prices and fluctuations of various bonds over the past week (in yuan):</p>
<p>Bond Type	Spot/Future	Highest Price (Week)	Lowest Price (Week)	Difference	Change Compared to Previous Week</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Sluggish Yarn Market Last Week</h3>
<p>| Current Demand Lacking Vigor |</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market has been exceptionally bleak over the past week, with minimal fluctuations. Both the bullish and bearish sides have considerable strength, resulting in intense contention. However, actual demand from merchant guilds is extremely quiet, and all parties lack vigor, primarily due to economic stagnation. Although harvests are good in many areas, the low prices of agricultural products continue to cause hardship for the farmers. Consequently, demand for yarn is weak, and sellers are reluctant to lower prices, leading to a sluggish market. Fortunately, current inventories are not yet excessive, allowing buyers to maintain some support. Overall, the yarn market is narrow. Towards the end of the week, the market suddenly dropped by one or two taels, and rumors spread that Shao was purchasing spot goods to meet standards, further weakening sentiment. Standard yarn fell nearly two taels and one mace, while yarn fell one tael, two mace, and five candareens. The total turnover for the week was 56,200 bales. Merchant guilds purchased a total of 3,672 bales of spot yarn, a decrease of 500 bales compared to the previous week. Prices fell by more than one tael. The following is a breakdown of the volume of spot goods purchased by various guilds:</p>
<p>Guild	Bales	Guild	Bales	Guild	Bales	Guild	Bales</p>
<p>Sichuan	40	Luzhou	10	Nanjing	27	Jiangxi	70</p>
<p>Anhui	26	Yunnan	185	North	5	Xiamen	10</p>

<p>Fujian	72	Fellow Traders	610	Ningbo	80	Zhenjiang	12</p>
<p>Total: 3,672 bales</p>

<p>March	149.5	148.3		Down 1.0</p>
<h3>Contention in the Cotton Market Last Week</h3>
<p>The cotton market has been marked by contention, with neither side gaining a clear advantage. One manufacturer's short selling of over 200,000 bales has not spurred any significant action, and small investors remain firm. Consequently, the market has fluctuated by around two taels. However, domestic harvests are plentiful, and shipments from various regions are increasing. Farmers are reluctant to sell at low prices, and recent increases in the price of foreign currency have indirectly raised domestic purchase prices. The American cotton market has also been sluggish. The US government's third estimate, favorable to short sellers, caused market prices to fall by over 40 points, significantly impacting the local cotton market. There is expected to be a significant change when trading opens on Tuesday. Standard cotton prices fell 1.2 candareens compared to the previous week. The total turnover for the week was 193,400 bales. The supply at the docks is increasing daily, with 25,484 bales of Yao cotton and 3,994 bales of Tong cotton arriving. Spot cotton trading has decreased slightly. American cotton prices fell by 40 points compared to the previous week. The following is a breakdown of the volume of spot cotton purchased by various manufacturers:</p>
<p>Cotton Type	Highest Price	Lowest Price	Volume Traded	Delivery Terms</p>
<p>Lingbao Cotton	39.00	36.50	400 pieces	Spot, delivered to factory</p>
<p>Yuyao Cotton	28.20	28.00	2,500 bales	Also dock delivery</p>

<h3>American Cotton Reports Sharp Decline Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton prices plummeted due to a government report favorable to sellers, profit-taking by Southern hedging sales and bulls. Futures fell by 42 to 47 points, spot prices fell by 40 points, British cotton futures fell by 35-36 points, spot prices rose by 3 points, and Egyptian cotton spot prices remained unchanged. The original telegraph record is on the left (eight-character telegram):</p>

<h3>US Government Report Shows Cotton Increase Again</h3>
<p>Washington, October 8th: The third cotton harvest estimate was released today by the Department of Agriculture's Bureau of Agricultural Economics, with a production volume of 11,425,000 bales, an increase of 115,000 bales compared to the previous estimate. The historical data for the year is recorded below:</p>
<p>Year	Percentage of Production	Production Volume	Final Actual Figures</p>
<p>October 1, 1932	54.2	11,425,000 bales</p>

<h3>US Cotton Market in a Sideways Trend Last Week</h3>
<p>Future trends depend on the extent of consumption</p>
<p>New York, October 7th: A report on the cotton market conditions this week states that the cotton market this week has been quite mixed. The next government cotton production report is scheduled to be released this Saturday (the 8th). As there is no certainty about its content, trading is generally restricted, and hedging sales are relatively weak, so the industry's buying appetite is sufficient to absorb it. In addition, most transactions are of a leveling nature. The cotton belt has experienced rain, followed by severe cold. There are reports of frost of varying degrees of severity in the western and central parts of the cotton belt. The Department of Agriculture has agreed to accept eight-sevenths of an inch of lint cotton as collateral for loans, based on a price of nine cents per pound. Some believe that this measure can promote orderly sales. However, the general sentiment is that the cotton crop is now almost complete, and even if the future harvest estimate differs by hundreds of thousands of bales, it will not have a significant impact on the market. The future trend of market prices will depend on the volume of sales and the development of general trade conditions. The weekend statistics are attached below (in thousands of bales):</p>
<p>1931	1932</p>
<p>Cumulative listings this season	3,110	2,810</p>

<h3>Double Tenth and the Gourd</h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>What is the one and only sealed gourd?</p>
<p>It is the voluminous report produced by the League of Nations investigation team, which, bearing a significant mission and consuming a long period, traveled to and fro across the sea, land, and air. Now, the lid of this particularly sealed gourd has been lifted before the Double Tenth Festival.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, I must admire the ingenuity of the ancients in creating characters; the covered part of the characters for "gourd" (葫蘆) are both "double ten" (雙十), as if predestined, and the date for lifting the lid of this sealed gourd would not be until before the Double Tenth Festival.</p>
<p>With the lid lifted off the gourd, it becomes a "Hu Lu" (胡盧): but, unfortunately, the explanation for "Hu Lu" is still almost the same as for "gourd," and what can be written as "gourd" can also be written as "Hu Lu"; the only difference is that what has the Double Tenth symbol is called "gourd," and what does not have the Double Tenth symbol is called "Hu Lu."</p>
<p>A voluminous report has indeed been revealed before the Double Tenth Festival! But does the content of the report truly accord with justice? Can the suggestions in the report truly be put into practice? Alas, time passes and dreams grow, and this is again an unknowable number. The lid of the sealed gourd has been broken, but it is still a sealed "Hu Lu": the content is much the same; the only difference is that an unrevealed report is called a sealed "gourd," and a revealed report is called a sealed "Hu Lu."</p>
<p>The report has reached the stage of disclosure, but the gentlemen of the League of Nations have agreed to the demands of the violent Sun (Japan) to remain silent on the study of the report for the next few weeks, with their mouths seemingly sealed with a cross; alas! It's over. The Double Tenth symbol of the sealed gourd has been transferred to their mouths!</p>
<p>Mysterious Double Tenth! Incomprehensible gourd!</p>
<h3>National Day Under National Crisis</h3>
<p>— Lü Mengjiao</p>
<p>Ah! Another year has passed, and it's National Day again. We call it "National Celebration," but it would be more accurate to call it "National Mourning" or "National Grief." We must not remain frogs at the bottom of a well; we should "ascend another story" to see the reality: a fleet of demons is arrayed on the East Sea, beginning their ambitions, constantly threatening and attacking us!</p>
<p>The devils with wooden clogs truly have endless tricks, such as bringing out puppets, organizing fake states, implementing immigration, gradually taking further steps, sending ambassadors, seizing customs duties, and even developing resources! Their procedures and resolute spirit are truly alarming!</p>
<p>"A state constantly perishing is one without foreign enemies." For the past thirty or forty years, we have been under the threat of foreign enemies almost every day, but have we grown stronger? Not only has the country not become stronger, but even the inherited ancestral lands are in danger of being lost. Foreign enemies are like potent morphine needles! Perhaps too many morphine needles have been injected, causing the skin to become numb. Events such as the recent internal fighting in Shandong and the impending conflict in Sichuan are heartlessly unfolding at this critical moment. As the enemy's threat deepens and our internal divisions persist, I am deeply saddened when I read the line "Only an empty name remains, the state not yet perished."</p>
<p>The bells of national crisis are ringing from all sides, accompanied by the sounds of battle and gunfire, enveloping this year's National Day of the eleventh year of the Republic of China.</p>

<p>Young man, why do you always hang me halfway up? January 28th, half-mast; May 3rd, half-mast; May 9th, half-mast; September 18th, half-mast. Enough is enough. You artificially shorten my body by half, and when I look up, the American flag, the British flag, the French flag, are all flying high, and what is even more unbearable is that the flag of that dwarf (Japan) is also climbing high above me, and their power has overwhelmed me. Young man, you forcefully stick me in the forest of international flags, covered in stains. What face do I have to meet people?</p>
<p>If this continues, it seems that I will be curled up in the middle of the air for three hundred and sixty days a year, with no hope of stretching out in space and breathing fresh air. Even today, young man, on my most glorious day, you treat me so coldly, with no celebrations, no holidays, no lanterns, and no people. What good is it? Young man, this is too much.</p>
<h3>The Riddle of National Day</h3>
<p>— Cimin</p>
<p>The glorious National Day of October 10th has already been shrouded in the shame of national crisis. Is this still worth celebrating?</p>
<p>We should try to unveil the heavy curtains of shame! But how can we unveil them? I think the riddle of the four characters "October Tenth" (十月十日), which yields the character "Court" (朝), provides us with the best method. (1) Those in the "Court" (朝), do not run "to the Court" in Luoyang, do not run "to the Court" of Shanghai's foreign concessions, do not run "to the Court" of Guangdong, do not run "to the Court" of Hangzhou; nor should they stretch their necks and simply pray "to the Court" of the League of Nations, simply "pay Court" to the countries on the western shore of the Pacific.</p>
<p>(2) Soldiers, generals, do not fire your guns and cannons "at the Court" of your own people, do not turn your backs and flee "to the Court" inside the customs; nor should you droop and look "at the Court" of the ground when you meet the Japanese, but become triumphant and look "at the Court" of the sky when you meet your own people.</p>
<p>(3) The wealthy should not only "face the Court inward," merchants should not offer tribute to the robber-grandfathers "at the Court" during the four seasons and eight festivals, and young people should not just "face the Court" to the movie theaters and dance halls, seeking pleasure in every way. The "Court" sun of the East is raging, and if we do not turn back in time and change the direction of the character "Court," then the great Republic of China may become a second Korea! Friends! Have you cracked the riddle of National Day?</p>
<h3>How Many More Reunions? Ji Xiang</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>My friend often says to me: "What's the point of talking about patriotism now? It's really foolish! National affairs are the responsibility of the important people; ordinary people are only allowed to eat and sleep. If you insist on not being content and get up to ask about the country, the result will only be disappointment! Perish the country? What are you afraid of? They won't kill you anyway! The earth will be destroyed sooner or later, so who will be glorious then? Who will be ashamed? It will all be over anyway!"</p>
<p>Indeed, talking about the country right now is fundamentally boring! Once a year, it's National Day again. Naturally, "The country is in trouble, what celebration is there?" What is there to celebrate in National Day amidst national crisis? I say that's not right, the more the country is in crisis, the more we should enjoy ourselves in time.</p>
<p>How so?</p>
<p>Didn't the ancients say? "How many times in one's life does one see the moon at its fullest?" We don't know what will happen next year, how many more of these National Days will we have? While the country still exists, if we don't revel in time, what are we waiting for?</p>
<p>So, my friend and I raise our glasses to wish each other well, drink with tears of sorrow, and promise not to stop until we are drunk. Perhaps if we just die drunk, things would be even better!</p>
<h3>A Cry-Laughing Double Tenth Festival</h3>
<p>— Xu Bo'an</p>
<p>Time flies like an arrow, and in the blink of an eye, it's the 21st National Day anniversary. Back when the martyrs of the Xinhai Revolution raised the banner and swept away the foreign atmosphere, we originally wanted to make the tenth of October an eternal National Day celebration, partly out of an inexplicable joy at the eradication of thousands of years of autocratic poison overnight, and partly to commemorate the countless loyal and brave patriots who died heroically on the battlefield. But things in this world never go exactly as one wishes. That first National Day anniversary can only be counted as a one-time celebration, because although the Qing dynasty had announced its abdication and the form of government had been changed to a republic, the people were still groaning and eking out a living under the heavy exploitation of corrupt officials, without receiving the slightest benefit of democratic politics. Not only did they not receive any benefits, but before long, a restoration movement by the autocratic remnant Yuan Shikai came about. Thus, armies to suppress the rebels arose, defense forces , and the common people embarked on the road to death.</p>
<p>If we just roughly review the Double Tenth Festivals of the past twenty-one years, it will be enough to make us beat our chests in anguish and cry out in despair! After Yuan Shikai's imperial movement failed, there followed a continuous series of warlord混战: The Zhili-Anhui War was such that we stumbled and rose again, you stumbled and I rose again, fighting with great vigor. The Fengtian-Zhili War continued for one, two, three times, without stopping. The other wars, like the Jiangsu-Zhejiang War, also killed countless lives, and the soldiers in Sichuan were taking the lives of the people day and night. During this time, people also helplessly held National Day celebrations once a year, but what were they celebrating? What was there to celebrate? This kind of National Day was a superfluous National Day, this kind of commemoration was a commemorative performance, and in reality, it gave us pain rather than joy!</p>
<p>Since the completion of the Northern Expedition by the National Revolutionary Army, everyone has been expecting thorough improvements in domestic politics, maximum enhancement of international status, and how the lives of rural poor people will be stabilized and guaranteed. However, that turned out to be a dream, a sad dream! China's revolution, due to the legacy of bad national character and the unlimited expansion of selfish desires to争权夺利, has not yielded any satisfactory good results. Moreover, rebellion and campaigns of punishment arose together, and launching uprisings and suppression were carried out simultaneously, resulting in endless wars and the people living in misery, almost the same as the warlord混战 before the revolution! During this time, people also helplessly held National Day celebrations once a year, but what were they celebrating?</p>
<p>What was there to celebrate? This kind of celebration was a superfluous National Day, this kind of commemoration was a commemorative performance, and in reality, it gave us pain rather than joy!</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident (Mukden Incident) broke out, the 20th National Day anniversary became a desolate and lonely funeral ceremony. Since the January 28th Incident (Shanghai Incident) was staged, the listlessness of the 21st National Day anniversary is self-evident. If we think about it, from the year when we had a National Day to the present twenty-one years, it has been filled with the increase of countless National Humiliation Memorial Days, and the only National Day anniversary is already precarious and about to fall apart. To save the country from danger and to revitalize the nation's fortunes, to turn all the National Humiliation Memorial Days into National Day celebrations, that is not difficult. All that is needed is for the government in power to turn over a new leaf from now on and work hard to save the country, and for the common people to be motivated and responsible from now on and unite to resist Japan. But, heaven! Don't you see the two generals Han and Liu in the Jiaodong Peninsula sharpening their fists and preparing for the蚌鶔之爭? Don't you see the warriors in Sichuan, that land of abundance, all sharpening their swords and preparing for internal strife? In this kind of environment, how can we resist Japan? Under these circumstances, how can we save the country? At this time when the borders are not yet peaceful and the flames of civil war are about to ignite, what is the meaning of holding National Day celebrations? This makes me unable to laugh and unable to cry!</p>
<p>Under the control of a cry-laughing mood, I finished writing this cry-laughing Double Tenth Festival article. National Day celebrations are not just once a year, something that can be done perfunctorily, it's simply getting worse and worse, and the country will no longer be a country! But are we just going to be confused and ignore it? That's not right, we should overcome our weak nature, we should work hard! We must use strong will to fight in many ways! We must use a spirit that is not afraid of death to repel our enemies! When that time comes, when both the domestic traitors and the international enemies are gone, that will be the success of our hard work, and it will also be the time when our countless National Humiliation Days become National Day celebrations!</p>
<p>On the eve of the Double Tenth Festival, I respectfully announce this righteousness to the patriotic young masses of the country.</p>
<h3>Double Tenth Festival Message to Zi Zhuzong in Taipei and Beiping</h3>
<p>— Wu Dongyuan</p>
<p>In the past, I grinded my shield and wrote new poems. Two 和 generals wrote white snow poems. Eyelashes are in front of your eyes, yet you can't see them. What can the flesh and thigh inside do? We meet again in the old autumn of the Ren Shen year. Talking about the rich spring in the Gui Chou time. Do you remember the moonlit lake on the Yueyang Tower illuminating the golden cup?</p>
<p>I can still live in Penglai as a banished immortal. (Borrowed sentence) Which scholar has the talent of a great general? The Huai and Ji are inferior to this incense table official. The pillars and beams are truly talents of the Yutang. Three thousand guests sincerely submit. Five hundred immortals are the first choice. Such rivers and mountains, such trees. The west wind and yellow leaves bring autumn.</p>
