<h3>廣國内非戰運動</h3>
<p>— 彬</p>
<p>比以連年戰亂。國艱民困。而强鄰伺隙。禍變突發。更使我民族頓陷危急存亡之險境。岌岌不可終朝。憂國之士。怵於亡國滅種之禍至之無日。乃多主「實行國内非戰運動。」遏止戰爭。並曾有人提出具體辦法多項。勉勗國人共起實行此種嫉惡戰爭。愛好和平。憂國謀國之熱忱。誠至足多。獨是吾人尙覺有數點。須爲闡述補充者。爰舉以供國内人士之共同商榷討論。</p>
<p>民國以來。我國家即長困於軍閥混戰之烽火中。爭城以戰。殺人盈城。爭地以戰。殺人盈野。國本因以動搖。民生因以凋敝。而外患乃更乘隙而入。制我民族之死命。吾人今日而廻溯二十年來戰禍之兇殘與荼毒。同時更顧慮我國家民族之前途。懲前毖後。則此根本斵喪我民族生命之内戰。吾人自不得不嚴厲反對。更不得不從根本上澈底杜絕。然而吾人認爲民國以來軍閥之此仆彼興。内戰之連綿不斷者。固非偶然。要必有其致此之根因。換言之。即必有至此之社會背景。語其大者。社會經濟今仍停滯於不斷的朽腐不斷的破落之「封建經濟」之堦段。統治權力建立於租稅等封建榨取之關係上。此軍閥得以産生之經濟背景也。帝國主義者爲便利其對殖民地之侵略。自不得不拉攏軍閥。爲其工具。爲其替手。務造成我國分崩離析之局面。使其無法統一。無以建立鞏固而有力之中樞政府。此又軍閥得以生存之國際背景也。劃疆而守。擁兵自雄。勢均力敵。尙可相安於一時。勢不均。則爲爭奪肥沃之土地而戰。爲爭奪繁榮之城市而戰。爲爭奪財政之收入機關而戰。質言之。即爲擴大統治之勢力範圍。擴大榨取之地域範圍。矛盾内潛。終必爆發。即終不免於戰。益以國際帝國主義者之各以其利害關係。從而鼓盪煽動。推波助瀾。供給以軍火。借予以軍費。換言之。即移國際之戰爭爲我國内之戰爭。一次戰敗。下次又重振旗鼓而來。資本主義内在之矛盾一日而不解决。則由於其相互間之衝突火併。顯而爲我國内之軍閥混戰。蓋爲事所必然。此又我國内戰之所以連綿不絕之根因也。</p>
<p>吾人旣已曉此根因。則又可知軍閥非僅「不合作」所可推翻。而軍閥混戰亦非「非戰運動」所可消滅。人民如不能以積極有效之行動。表示嚴厲之反抗。根本掊覆軍閥之所自産生之經濟背景。及其所賴以生存之靠山。則非者自非。而戰者自戰。「和平」之「不合作」在「不和平」之强權壓迫之下。究何由而堅持不屈。如屈於强權。則所謂非戰。仍不過爲烏托邦之幻夢耳。嚮使戰可以弭而止。可以文字條約予以限制防遏。則歐洲第一次大戰。固絕不至爆發。而今日國際間之和平運動。如軍縮會議。如非戰公約等。應早已收得美滿之效果。世界應早已永慶和平。其所以不能者。社會制度内在矛盾有以致之也。</p>
<p>故吾人認爲在今日人民對於内戰。固應絕對杜絕。但「和平之非戰運動」則絕不能收穫實效。吾人如欲根本消滅戰爭。博取永久之和平。則似應另覓取其他有效之途徑。蓋維持現狀之和平。乃苟安之和平。虛僞之和平。而非永久之和平。此則吾人在今日所應明白體認把握者也。</p>

<p>（南京）　國聯調查團初步報告、四日披露全文如次、</p>
<p>第一篇</p>
<p>本調查委員會自經依照行政院十二月十日决議案第五節、指派成立、已於四月二十一日抵瀋陽、現正從事於就地調查、自抵遠東以來、本委員會已睚蔓衍於中日兩國之一般情形、就其與本身工作有關者、加以調查、本委員會曾赴東京大阪上海南京漢口天津及北平等處、與兩國政府人員晤商、幷接見兩國中多數有關係各界代表、在北平會晤九月十九日以前東北各省主管當局之代表、自抵瀋陽後、會晤日本代理總領事、關東軍司令官本莊將軍、及其他人員、查行政院主席宣言、關於十二月十日决議案、令委員會於到達當地後、將現有情勢、就其與中日兩國政府是否履行九月三十日决議案所包含十二月十日决議案所重述之某數項保證有關者、儘速具一初步報告、提交行政院、該數項保證、爲（一）日本政府當「以日本人民生命財産之安全、得有切實之保證爲比例、繼續將其軍隊從速撤退至鐵路區域以内、」（二）中國政府「對於該區域以外之日僑生命財産之安全、在日軍繼續撤退中國地方官吏及警察再行恢復時當負責任、」（三）雙方政府「當採取一切必要步驟、以防止事變範圍之擴大、或情勢之愈加嚴重、」關於此三點、本委會尙未能提出充分報告、關於「此事變範圍擴大或情勢愈加嚴重、」雙方所負保證之考慮、必須留待以後報告、但行政院對於關係上述（一）（二）兩節、中日兩國所負保證之現有情勢、等候早日報告、是以茲將下列報告第二篇送請查照、</p>
<p>第二篇</p>
<p>東省之實際情形、關於東北三省軍事情形之消息、已由日本軍事當局供給、計分五章、前三章叙述日本軍隊以及其他與日軍合作之軍隊、後二章述及反對日軍之軍隊、關於第四章消息、亦係得自華人方面、茲應注意者、于所陳之分欵中、發現一種新特點、此爲去年九月本案進展中行政院所未經計及、而爲此次調查之目標者、即當地之行政組織、業經變更、治安維持委員會由日方協助、初成立於公歷一九三一年末數月中、該委員會嗣由一九三二年三月九日所成立之政權、號稱「滿洲國政府」者替代之、爲說明日本軍事當局用滿洲國軍隊等字樣、此項解釋係屬必要也、</p>
<p>第一章　日本正式軍隊</p>
<p>據九月十八日滿洲鐵路區域内日軍之數、一萬零五百九十人、十二月上半月、南</p>
<h2>Page 6</h2>

<p>第二章　「滿洲國」軍隊</p>
<p>（一）經日本軍事當局所指爲「滿洲國」軍隊者、其中一部分、聞係九月十九日以前駐滿之中國正式軍隊、嗣經改編者、爲一部分及新募之兵士、此項軍隊乃由日軍事當局協助創設、多數退伍之日軍官或現仍在日軍服務之日軍官、巳被聘爲軍事顧問、其數目日見增加、且有訂定全年合同者、日本參謀本部某軍官、被任爲長春「滿洲國政府」國防部之顧問、（二）此項軍隊大多在瀋陽長春·洮南·齊齊哈爾·敦化及沿中東鐵路區域駐防或作戰、此項軍隊以前在鐵路東段、與不承認滿洲國政府政權之軍隊作戰、據云、截至三月底止、總數爲八萬五千人、現因關於此項軍隊、報告不甚翔實、尙未確知其實數、（三）地方警察、此項警察之數目、約十一萬九千人、其中六萬人、係地方警備隊、據稱、此項警察隊大部份係九月十八日以前已有者、繼續存在、經日官員協助改編、（四）又對日軍及反滿洲國軍之軍隊、本調查委員會在北平時、由張學良將軍告知、九月十九日事變之時、其軍隊在關外者、包括非戰鬥員計駐遼寗者六萬人、駐吉林者八萬人、駐黑龍江者五萬人、共計十九萬人、其中駐遼寗之軍隊、嗣有五萬人左右、撤入關内、故剩留關外者、有十四萬人、據日本軍事當局所述、現在關外軍隊之數爲十一萬人、其中八萬人已加入滿洲國軍隊、三萬人則在吉林之東北抗禦日軍、及滿洲國軍隊、約有二萬人、或已加入所謂義勇軍、據彼等所述情形如下、</p>
<p>（甲）舊中國軍隊之一部、不承認滿洲政府之政權、一在哈爾濱東北之一軍當有三萬人、「據中國正式宣稱、係由李杜將軍指揮之吉林自衛軍、及丁超將軍指揮之中東鐵路護路軍組織之」、</p>
<p>（乙）義勇軍、一在遼寗省之西部、所謂東北反日義勇軍、大部分在錦州之南、約有在一萬五千人至二萬人之間、二所謂東北國民義勇軍、大部分係吳慶所指揮、大部分在瀋陽四週活動、此項部隊、曾與日軍衝突數次、現在兵力未詳、三熱河義勇軍、此項軍隊紀律較佳、由湯玉麟指揮、約有三千人、包括有張學良將軍之第一第二兩師之騎兵殘部在内、據報、在熱河·遼寗邊境活動、四勢力較小之義勇軍數隊、一部分在山海關一帶、一部分在敦化及天寳山間作戰、彼等在該處與敵對滿洲國政府之正式軍隊連成一氣、本節第一段之第四段所述之非正式軍、據稱約有四萬人、</p>
<p>（五）土匪、土匪固非爲政治目的而組織、因紛亂情形其數已見增加、據日方報告、彼等散處全滿各地、在中東鐵路之南部尤多、日方估計其總數爲四萬人、此外在吉林城之北部及東部、另有土匪一萬二千人、據云與上文（四）（甲）一所述駐在哈爾濱東北之中國軍隊合作、此等各方勢力常有武力衝突、如土匪刦掠及日軍及滿洲國軍隊剿匪之企圖、幷各方軍隊謀維持新政權與反對新政權之戰事、其結果則爲生命之損失財産之破壞、並咸感不安焉、</p>
<p>第三章</p>
<p>本調查委員會在此時期對於上列之事實及數目、不欲加以批評、日方當局主張、目下不能撤兵、以免在鐵路區域以外日僑之生命財産、發生危險、彼等似以爲撤兵、並須視其所稱爲滿洲國軍隊改組之進步如何以爲定準、中國政府在滿洲任何部分現不施行政權、並以近日事件之發展、故履行其責任之實際問題、尙未發生、本委員會在最後之報告中、對於足以恢復和平與安全之可能、及公正辦法、與造成全部好感之合理辦法、當予以考量、本委員會當於下星期前往長春、然後至滿洲其他各地繼續調查（四日中央社電）</p>

<p>▲國民社三日華盛頓電　美聯社記者稱、美國國務卿史汀生此次赴歐之目的、係欲歐洲各國協助美國保持中國之門戶開放主義、並促進軍縮會議之成功、現據可靠方面所言、此種目的今已大見成效、惟英法意等國同時不願採取何種行動、以避免與日軍發生惡感、史汀生對於歐洲各國之决心維持條約之尊嚴、以保存中國之獨立權、亦頗有良好之印象、</p>

<p>▲國民社四日日内瓦電　德國軍縮代表領袖那慶尼與德總理白魯寗在電話中長談後、今日突啓程回柏林、據代表團聲稱、係被召回國、討論日内瓦目前局勢、</p>

<p>▲哈瓦斯三日倫敦電　倫敦每日電聞報評論法國選舉、謂法國秉政者即使易人、法國外交政策、未必改途易轍云云、</p>
<p>▲哈瓦斯三日柏林電　德國報紙對於法國選舉、多所評論、交易所報稱、社會黨及急進社會黨所合組之反對派勢力、較前增加、但謂其能追及泰狄歐多數派各黨之優越地位、則尙未能云、禾斯日報稱、左派各黨、若欲使泰狄歐政府失敗、至少須較前多得六十席云云、地方民聲報謂、同情於左派聯盟者、其歡欣未免失之過早、蓋即使左派果如彼等所期望而獲勝利、亦不見能組織内閣也、</p>

<h3>魯擬改革軍制</h3>

<h3>王家烈主黔之經過</h3>

<p>貴陽通訊、黔省政府主席、業由國府明令改任主家烈、其中毛辭王繼、表面上乃國府根據前黔省府主席毛光翔之電保、毛之退讓、其先固有一叚經過、當周西成統率黔軍時代、毛王均爲周部兩師長、論能力則王優於毛、顧論私交、則周於毛爲親、蓋毛乃周之妹丈也、毛旣受周之優遇、勢力獨厚、聲援亦廣、故周死而毛乃繼膺主席、王不得志、遂率部入湘、離開本省、然其回省參政之抱負、則未嘗一日去懷、在湘時、對軍隊整理、不遺餘力、因湘省交通、較黔爲便、軍實補充、亦交易從事、毛不能自安、以王遲早之必返也、遂商之左右、自行邀王回省、以免多事、王因親率四團返、惟至省城附近、即停駐不進、毛之初意、以本人身任主席兼任總指揮敎導師師長等職、擬以主席讓王、使主民政、總指揮敎導師師長等職、則仍自任、故薦王任主席之電、即行發出、然是時王仍未進省、蓋認本省民政權之實行、仍不得不借武力爲佐助也、當此之時、雙方因意見之爭、省城人心頗爲震動、誠恐引起兵禍、所幸其他中間性質之軍官、如猶國材車鳴翼黄彦彬等、力勸毛全部退讓、毛睹大勢不可、遂並軍權而幷棄之、現毛仍住省城、所部僅留一手槍營以資保護而已、故雖與王同居一城、亦能相安無事焉、</p>

<h3>日兵越橋刺傷七華人案</h3>
<p>▲工部局負有責任</p>
<p>▲市政府嚴重交涉</p>
<p>▲納稅會鄭重奉告</p>
<p>▲美京望迅速解决</p>
<p>前日下午六時半、日軍在烏鎭路橋附近、刺傷華人七名、一時形勢、異常嚴重、旋經租界捕房派員前往彈壓、並由美軍兩名帮同勸阻、行兇日軍、始行退回閘北、此案關係重大、頗爲各界重視、茲爲分誌如次、</p>
<p>▲市政府之抗議　上海市政府昨致工部局函云、「逕啓者、本月三日下午、新閘路烏鎭路橋附近、有日兵越入租界、追逐行人、直達派克路、刺傷華人七名一案、當已由該管捕房報告貴局在案、查肇事地點、屬於租界、貴局對於居住特區之華人、負有保障安全之責、乃該日兵等在界内之兇暴行爲、貴局旣不能防範、又不能制止、遂使本國民衆、橫受摧殘、殊深遺憾、相應函達、請煩查照嚴重交涉、並飭屬盡力保護居住界内之華人、俾同樣事件、不再發生、實紉公誼、仍盼見覆爲荷、此致公共租界工部局、秘書長俞鴻鈞」、</p>
<p>▲納稅會之奉告　公共租界納稅華人會、以連日日軍在界内迭次肇事、居民人人自危、昨特再函工部局、請迅採有效辦法、以期常態早日恢復、原函云、逕啓者、本月三日、本會因天潼路三百二十二三號南洋印務公司職工二十五人、被日之軍綁架、不知所在、經函請貴局迅予查救、並採用最有效辦法、以使常態早見恢復在案、同日又准寗波旅滬同鄕會委員長虞和德函同前情、不料本日閱報、日軍又於三日下午、在新閘路以刺刀向行人猛刺、幷至醬園弄附近李恒興圓作店、無故猛擊該店老婦、又在鄰近祥泰衣莊尋釁、因未得逞、轉至王豐泰洋貨號用刀擊碎玻璃櫃櫉等情、披閱之下、不勝駭異、一月以來、貴局努力於恢復平常狀態、並根據此項願望、竟至聽信片面的報告、由貴局情報處發表聲明書、以容忍勸勉華人、但日軍連日在租界内發生之暴行、貴局維持治安之職權、已不在心目中、其將採用此種暴戾之手段、圖達到其某種目的、灼然可見、長此以往、必使租界居民、發生無可容忍之心理、懷疑於貴局防止擾亂恢復常態之能力、其影響之大、無可言喻、本會用特鄭重奉告、務希貴局注意於此種形勢之嚴重、迅採有效的制裁方法、執行所謂公平機關之公平處置義務、保障嗣後不再有此等類似事件、以安居業、毋任企盼、並祈將辦理情形、迅速見復爲荷、</p>

<p>▲大美晚報紀載　大美晚報云、昨晚日本水兵七八十人離開閘北崗位、爬過烏鎭路鐵門及鐵絲網、持槍戳傷或毆擊新閘一帶華人、嗣由美陸軍奇羅少佐携美兵一排與工部局捕房西捕頭等堅决干涉、日兵始退回閘北、目下工部局與有關係國領事對於此事、尙未有任何正式行動、但信各當道關於站崗閘北日軍擅入公共租界一層、俟獲得詳細報告後、即將提出交涉云、</p>
<p>▲美官場之意見　國民社三日華盛頓電云、今日美陸軍部與國務院、關於上海蘇州河南日兵與美兵幾致衝突事件、雖尙未接官報、但官塲據報紙電訊所載、表示意見、謂若輩信美兵曾循守職分行事、現希望此事當可就地迅速順利解决云、</p>

<p>以現在中國情勢、而仍洄溯革命之往跡、已屬十分悲慘之事、革命之主力、日漸消沉、革命之領導權、日形搖動、甚至革命之對象與革命黨人之信仰及意志、亦日就模糊、吾人如承認中國革命之未完成、即不能毁黨而謂爲補救、近來黨内之有責任者、往往因國難之嚴重、受外界之詰難、即主爲急就章之憲政、不恤自毁以從人、吾人創心國難而不敢苟同、爰致所疑、以質賢者、哲生同志近所發表之言論、見於各報記載、無意中實陷於嚴重錯誤、吾人於國難初作時、已指出各方有此毁黨救國之趨勢、並力言黨毁而國卒不可救、今不幸哲生立言、乃如是易爲他方所假藉也、綜合其所論列、一則謂現在中央不能領導全國民衆、無可諱言、再則謂近來黨之信用、實已完全失掉、今欲補救、當有澈底改革之决心、吾人誠不知此所肯定之前提、何由成立、將謂現在黨之政權、已不能領導全國民衆乎、然則能領導者又安在、爲共産黨乎、爲國家主義派乎、爲軍閥官僚之死灰乎、凡一革命之黨、與某一政治運動、其能取得革命領導權與某種形式之政權、必有其時代背景與社會確在之條件、决非可以玄想而致、亦有容其妄自菲薄、本黨之能領導中國國民革命、自是基於客觀事實之决定、共産黨超越經濟階段之辦法、卽無能掖之使前、國家主義派代表狹隘之民族觀點與行會經濟思想之辦法、復不能掣之使後、如謂爲軍閥官僚輩乎、則此時代之遺骸、革命之塵滓、遂能出墟墓而席政權、有是理乎、如謂人民當憲政自爲乎、則民元以後、民國且數數被毁、約法則毛鞟不存、使無革命之黨鍥而不舍、則今日所謂民國、早已不可問矣、哲生旣有如上之肯定、故主張籌備實施憲政、以爲訓政已有四年、徒有其名、毫無成效可言、長此以往、時不我待、故主張速行籌備憲政開始、不必再待訓政形式之終了、且地方自治未了工作、儘可於憲政開始後同時進行、不必待至其完成以後也、又謂抗日非今日政府單獨力量所能做到、惟由政府與全國人民合作、始能收最後效果、憲政旣成、則人民政府合一、抗日力量自必雄厚矣云云、吾人旣知訓政與憲政之先後關係、憲政開始、待必於訓政之完成、何以訓政提前結束、而憲政即可突兀出現、民元不曾有約法乎、其實質固等於憲法也、固亦曾有憲政之政治制度矣、帝制復辟、狐埋者狐復搰之、其後曹錕以賄選爲總統、天安門所佈之黄緞憲法、至今猶在史筬、猶流餘穢、憲法具矣、憲政行矣、而革命以求之中華民國安在哉、今一旦舊事重提、喧呶衆口、汲汲若不可待者、即爲此立法毁法從政敗政之諸人、自有憲政、皆有革命而來、未有不誓行革命之主義、而可即於憲法之治者、彼諸人當日根不粉碎革命黨人、剿絕革命種子、一面則附和帝制、附和復辟、附和賄選、其後又來附和黨治、而終惡其不便已也、遂於今日思有以去其籍、所謂結束訓政、即結束黨之領導革命也、而輕掩其跡於憲政之美名、此外尙有所謂超然之學者、在野之名流、亦皆雷同民憲、高吮入雲、其志當欽、其實多午、夫革命政治之下、無所謂超然、革命環境之中、無所謂在野、苟皆行使四權、即已支配治具、若必假他途以求所謂憲政、適然而爲反革命集團張其軍、可勝惋惜、此猶就人事方面言之耳、至言憲政本身、民元倉猝創制總理極以未先行訓政爲絕大憾事、　譬諸建築、須固基礎、使軍政甫終、憲政已始、此種過天橋之辦法、行之而可有效者、則民元後不致變亂相尋、而建國大綱亦無勞總理垂制矣、殊不意哲生反獨失此於趨庭之訓也、自治不完成、即訓政爲虛殻、訓政不經過、即憲政爲具文、中國國民黨過去之一切努力、一切犧牲、首爲求得訓政、以造成革命之憲政、若僅以憲法條文及政府組織爲憲政、則彼資産階級之民主運動、固爲之綽然也、而謂此可使政府與人民合一、直欺騙民衆而已、至謂憲政開始、地方自治可以同時進行、吾人誠不知舍本而急於逐末者何故、今以少數人之意旨爲金科玉律、毁總理之主義以毁黨毁政、此對反革命集團爲自除武裝、奚見其可也、且訓政乃以總理之主義訓政、吾人爲總理之信徒、亦國民之僕、所事不臧、遽自暴棄、不忠不信、有始無終、則行憲又安有就、哲生至又謂憲政之行、政府旣與人民合一、故共産黨及國家主義派、皆可以有法律内之行動、殊不計共産黨所欲奪取者乃整個之政權、而由無産階級操持之、其欲採用議會政策者、非第三國際指揮下之中國共産黨也、謂憲政開始後、共産黨乃有所愛重於吾人之法律而遵守以爲行動、憲政之作用大矣哉、至可格共産黨而舞干羽於兩階、此誠奇詭之至矣、至國家主義派所需要之憲政、非總理所謂之憲政、彼亦自有其建立政權之企圖、而决不願在黨治之下並存者、凡此招携、終於無效、而徒毁革命之力也、此意極願哲生深察之、吾人連類言之、尙有以黨之存在爲召致國難之因繇者、抑知黨不存在、國疑必更甚於此日乎、日人之嫉長本黨、由其一般之論調可以知之、黨毁則侵略更易、往事可證者多矣、今奈何自撤墉垣、以取快於敵我者乎、黨以民主集權之形式、治黨治政、猶虞散漶不給、顧何取於泛民主之虛名、而受無組織之實禍乎、内外孔練、反欲自滋其棼、謀國詎可兒戲出之、且敵之搆難、自有其預下之决心、我唯有以抵抗圖存之决心報之而已、國人之所欲效死、政府之府紆籌、皆爲抗禦此侵犯我國家領土主權行政完整之壓境大敵、今不以革命之政治意義獻力政府、領導國人、而别爲紆迴之謀、非可憲政一施、敵即望風潰退也、以必無之事、毁可爲之業、恐黨亡而國亦隨之、革命熸而民族亦燼矣、彼反革命集團、此時公然集矢、有所不敢、故巧立名目、行刦制之實、黨人而不自努力於革命救國、國人而不深察反革命集團之用心、此眞危無可挽者也、夫訓政爲黨之現行工作、政府奉黨命以爲設施、然而離開革命、何取於訓政、離開訓政、何須乎有本黨、離開本黨、更何須乎有現在之政府乎、在本黨建國程序中、固懸示憲政之時期、而工作亦無不趨適於憲政、但本黨所求之憲政、乃革命之憲政、憲法乃革命之憲法、而惟有革郚之人民、乃克受之行之耳、否則起袁世凱諸人於九京、復曹錕於政府、豚苙而招、議者多在、彼其言出爲經、行出爲法、典章之熟、技術之專、或尙有非時下所能盡及者、言法制則儘有原理原則之發皇、言選舉則儘有朦賄糾攬之運用、勢非加厲於民元以後之情况不可也、今一切言者、始因皆爲國難之亟也、以國難而謀所以固其國本則可、以國難而反以危動其國本則萬萬不可也、吾人以爲在此國難期間、使國人監督政治、導國人參加政治、實爲天經地義之事、但總理於建國大綱中所定之程序與方法、黨人固絕對奉爲寳典、亦國人多數所遵循、决不應擅爲變置、如政府奉行之人、遲滯事工、努力未至、則當自劾於總理及國人之前、而亦無由變革總理之敎制也、否則不應紛擾而紛擾之愈陷國家於無法、故在此意義之下、黨内之精誠團結、與國人之共赴時艱、實爲解救國難之唯一要義、抑亦渡過國難之唯一路途、今乃皇皇然索途於四方、何能有當、第眞能團結共赴、持以堅强恒忍之心則禦侮自衛、一切不患無辦法、雖有國難、决不足畏、故在黨人方面、决當愼擇所以自處、刻勵勇敢、爲民前鋒、而念念不忘建國治國之責務、人民方面、亦當從正面督促黨與政府、使之爲不屈服不喪權之奮鬥、集心力於共同之大道、如是則全國眞實合一、必可於最短期間、解救國家之危難、且推進革命之成功也、二十一年五月三日、</p>

<h3>金融春賽最後日金價趨跌三兩</h3>
<p>▲半天有六兩曲折　昨爲春賽末日、金業市塲依舊上午半日、午後停市、標金稍有變動、乍進乍退、勢不可遏、早午間有六兩之曲折、終則趨跌三兩光景、初以銀市微跌、反開低盤惟外匯尙穩、更以檯面上買方蓬勃、曾見七百四十七兩二錢新價、復後潜萎　、謠傳紛起、謂日俄形勢又爲緊急、殆多頭者復已傾賣、遂轉下乘、貶落五兩餘、人心猶豫、所有現貨標金、茲聞某銀行賡續開進云、茲錄前市情况如後、</p>
<p>▲一幕晨市之過去　自早開六月份爲七百四十二兩五錢、即跌二兩六錢、蓋大條只降八分之一、銀價公私電均跌四分之一、脚地報告、賣戶甚鮮、故人心似下也、次由四十二兩至四十三兩五錢、後由恒餘丙興鴻康永順利等買進、致價漸升三兩、然有數錢上下、迨英金揭佈未動、美金略减一二五、故漲爲四十六兩五錢、比因同太昌福昌等出售、立降二兩、爲四十四兩五錢、内盤美金平平、初由英日銀行互做六月三十元、旣而二十九元七五、且因同春福餘元成永等等咸來爭購、而價即行上騰、九點十餘分爲四十七兩二錢、（本日最高之價）後以福餘志豐永大德成元春及物品套頭相繼賣出、至美金八月份三十元零二五、故降四兩餘、在十餘分鐘有一兩零起伏、九點三十餘分爲四十二兩五錢、至後大連帮買進、好起二兩、但福餘裕和源泰等則出、遂退一兩六七錢、人心恍惚、至十點一刻後忽見起色、因恒興恒餘内興大興永及投機商等前來拖進、殆英金仍結六二五、猶傳某銀行購去現貨之說、市價一聳而上、至十點半爲四十六兩八錢、往後波浪興起、謠聞日俄有衝突之訉、同業心思即萎、計恒餘元茂永福餘福太亨及大連帮等猛力脫手、一般散戶多頭隨之而賣、以希軋平、以此市價一瀉五兩餘、（惟自十點半後至十一點三刻有二兩餘曲折）殆美金遠期對做三十元零二五、近期可結二十九元九三七五、直至十一點四十餘分卒爲四十一兩三錢、時由物品買進、拉上兩餘、爲二兩半、迨午收四十二兩二錢、比較前午回落二兩九錢、（迭漲多日之反向也）</p>
<p>▲揭價抑七十五兩　據半日中最大四十七兩二錢、最小四十一兩三錢計有五兩九錢差額、揭價改爲八百十六兩、計撳七十兩至七十五兩、豋賬補水同爲四十二兩、赤條計加五兩</p>

<h3>匯市明緊暗鬆</h3>
<p>昨日銀市雖跌　而匯豐掛牌各匯僅美金縮一二五、爲二十九元半、香港减二五、爲七十六兩三七五、法郎小去一元、和洋降二五、餘如英印德坡等均無良莠、至於内盤亦屬平定、英金始終和上日無異、惟美金略有升縮、初平繼堅、午時復鬆、比較前午長一八七五正謂明緊暗寛之勢、華商交易仍無大票、計英金僅以二三萬鎊、孟買電售七月份、而美金約共三四十萬元、英美比等商售與日商銀行者尙稱不鮮、廣帮恒興稍有抛出、遂套進條子、殆套價近期拔開四十五六兩、遠期約計五十兩、苟向扒結、則猶不洽、而今各金號仍多先令、而空花旗、惟數不鉅、後市因在春賽期内仍休假、</p>
<p>▲英匯　内盤僅以零六二五伸縮　上午初開賣價一先令七便士六二五至六八七五、買價六八七五至七五麥加利出八月六二五、住友買七月六八七五、三井進七五、（均是孟買單）午收賣價與早市彷彿</p>

<h3>回好聲中洋市又現巨跌</h3>
<p>▲客銷稀淡：：滬存如故</p>
<p>▲市塲槪况　前昨兩市、洋厘漲風甚熾、一般人目光所及、以爲從此可以青雲直上矣、詎昨午忽生反動、其跌勢不亞漲風、推原其故、外埠前胃甚稀、而本街存底由積、如果銀行無買胃、則厘價穩站、雖各業商貨發展、無如類率用銀、對於洋欵總以收入爲多、終至重現跌風也、</p>
<p>▲厘拆價格　「洋厘」早市尙無變動、仍爲七錢零九厘、與前日早市相同、雖午市因受賣戶之勇氣、受者轉寥、頓時突跌一厘二毫半、僅爲七錢零七厘二毫半、「銀拆」早市竟做白借、而午市略有交易、遂開二分行市、銀行無掛牌劃頭始爲白劃、旋有八分市面、最後仍爲白劃、</p>
<p>▲輔幣市情　江南小洋、晨間忽然狂漲三厘、爲六錢一分四厘、午市勿動、據聞此項交易、本屬極少、祗以有人欲買、雖無巨額、亦有高漲之可能、交易早市四千角、早市二千角、廣東小洋、早市亦突漲三厘光景、爲六錢零八厘半、午市轉弱、爲六錢零七厘二毫半、交易早市八萬角、午市二萬角、銅元賡續下墜、又縮二千文、爲四百十五千五百文、二日中已縮五千文矣、</p>
<p>▲銀洋進出　「銀欵」銀行仍値跑馬封關、下午例無消息、收解方面、外商票欵一百七十餘萬、華商二百三十餘萬、匯兌收解九十餘萬、貨欵收解二百餘萬、押匯欵九十餘萬、關稅收入四十餘萬、墊欵一百萬、洋欵四十餘萬、雜欵收解三百餘萬、外商進倉三十萬、華商出倉七十萬、錢莊銀公單收解二千九百餘萬、銀劃頭欵收解三百四十餘萬、各路匯欵五十餘萬、收現四五十萬、「洋欵」匯劃票欵早市做出祗三十六萬、午市亦僅三十萬、鈔票早市三萬五千、午市一萬五千、支單早市七萬、午市四萬、銀行買賣、早市三十萬、午市亦祗三十萬、洋戶往來收解一百四十餘萬、鈔票進出一百四十餘萬、錢莊洋公單收解三百八十餘萬、洋劃頭收解一百三十餘萬、小錢莊交易五十餘萬、</p>
<h3>長期過後之消息</h3>
<p>金融界放做長期、原以四十兩月、爲唯一不移之固定時期、今年四底交易、因時局關係、稀少至已不成市、曾詳日前本報、但是外界對於流動調劑、旣受箝制、勢須竭力挽救、因而設法向金融界疏通者、實繁有徒、前聞已得金融界之許可、昨日紛紛成交、計六對欵不下六七十萬、息價俱在十兩以上、最高價則有十一兩五錢、聞受方類率爲本埠各殷實商店、所有客帮方面、要求通融、則大都拒絕、萬一情面關係、縮短期限、爲三對月、大約亦做出十餘萬云、</p>
<h3>證劵債市盤旋漲跌互見</h3>
<p>▲成交約三百萬</p>
<p>昨（四日）華商證劵交易所各債劵、現貨交易共九萬三千元、内統稅佔三萬七千元、關稅裁兵二○捲各計一萬元、其他較清、期市亦比前爲閒散、買賣大戶、均懷觀望、市面殊覺冷淡、計上午約二百萬、後市祗九十五萬元、合計二百九十四萬元、内除統鹽稅二○捲等各約五十萬、餘僅一二十萬元、至言變動情形、在上午兩盤以市上零戶售出頗不寂寞、賣方仍佔優勢、各價比前繼續下落、惟變動極微、後市賣戶未見繼續賣出、而市上零星需要猶不寂寞、各價因是漸見抬高、比上午各漲六七角至一元數角不等、結果比前日惟裁兵復漲二元五角、統稅漲一元四角、至一九善六月則跌二元一角、餘互有漲跌、爲數祗在半元左右、觀債劵市之形勢、以時局情况混沌、暫時將盤旋、不致有大漲落云、</p>

<h3>紗花十分悲觀的紗市</h3>
<p>棉紗市情依然不振、形勢十分虛弱、因時局仍在迷離恍惚中、且金融尙難流通、各路交通猶未恢復、對於運輸方面、益覺困難、至於内地經濟狀况、萬分枯涸、因之紗銷情形、異常滯鈍、無錫各廠囤積甚厚、據聞鄭州紗廠之紗、亦有來滬銷售說、足見四方紗市之悲觀矣、乃人心一致下游、故標紗價格步跌、近期又跌二兩云、</p>
<p>▲近期標紗又降二兩　標紗前市開盤、極其渙散、塲中交易甚少、買戶頗缺、各月跌一兩至一兩二·三·錢、午後形勢仍疲、後市開盤、時間甚短、祇二十分鐘已畢、各月又跌五·七·八·九·錢、全日成交統計、查賣出仁豐二百五十包、義餘四百包、總生三百包、天隆四百包、大昌成四百包、買進廣豐八百包、愼記二百包、長豐三百包、大豐一百五十包、永大一百五十包、茲將人標收盤價列左、</p>

<h3>期現棉零落不堪</h3>
<p>棉市見疲、形勢甚弱、外棉大跌小漲、紗價跌無止境、廠商態度失望、實銷極其冷淡、各廠絕少問津、但本棉存貨未厚、所以新抛未見踴躍、市氣軟中帶堅、交易大爲凋疲云、</p>
<p>▲鄭標疲落二三錢　交易所鄭標前市開盤、市况尙平、各月跌二錢、午後市情仍軟、各跌五分至一錢、全日成交統計五千八百担、查賣出益豐七百担、明華三百担、愼記三百担、信誠三百担、振大三百担、買進永大四百担、長豐四百担、瑞大二百担、茲將鄭標收盤價列左、</p>

<h3>外棉漲力微弱</h3>
<p>昨日美棉因華爾街不振及空戶扺補、市况參差不定、計期貨漲二至六磅音、現貨漲五磅音、英棉期貨漲十七八點、現貨漲四點、埃及棉現貨漲五點、印棉停市、原電錄左、（三日電）</p>

<h3>上海日廠開工之紡紗計畫</h3>
<p>上海各日商紗廠、認爲時局漸趨平靜、經同業會迭次協議决定四月二十六日全體開工、新招工人亦頗多、滬東各廠上工者約有百分之五十、滬西各廠約有百分之六十、運轉錠數亦居半數、至以所紡支數、亦早經準備、將變更向來方針、紡製目前可以銷售之支數、大都以十六支爲主、其他三十二支·四十支·四十二支（小絞）亦兼紡之、各廠中如内外棉將紡四十支·四十二支·（小絞）三十二支、豐田·上海·日華·均紡十六支、東華向來專紡二十支、今亦改紡十六支、裕豐紡四十二支（小絞）、其變更紡紗方針之原因如下、</p>
<p>（一）現二十支及四十二支（綾絞）銷路不良、存貨甚多、前途殊覺悲觀、而十六支·三十二支及四十支（小絞）全無存量、且大連·天津及印度方面尤有需要、自去年十二月以迄今年三月、因無貨可以供給、遂使輪出停頓、故目前開工後、即須設法補足出口、其數約六七千包、倘運轉紗錠有百分之二十五、足數銷售、且不致囤積、</p>
<p>（二）從市場觀察、現在十六支與二十支殆相同價、且十六支有較二十支反貴者、故在混棉採算上、認爲十六支有利云、</p>
<p>茲再將日本紗廠織機環線錠分類統計如左</p>
<p>線錠　七九一、二九○枚</p>

<h3>絲茶金華蠶收又告失望</h3>
<p>▲備受霪雨奇寒悶熱損害</p>
<p>金華舊府屬各市鄕蠶汎最早、今歲農民因鑒去歲蠶事失敗、今歲經濟窘迫、蠶本無處告貸、飼育春蠶者祗及往歲十之一二、早帮已大眠旺葉棄、晚帮亦已三眠出火詎陰雨連朝、乍寒乍熱、致蠶蟻咸起洩黄吐黑等病、殭斃者十之六七轉瞬即可上簇、而天時不佳、今歲蠶收又告失望</p>
<h3>糧食浦江米市到稀銷活</h3>
<p>▲滬南　昨日來源寥寥無幾浦存亦薄、市氣恐有變化且洋米洋行家續有抛出、人心稍有進意、但成交稍旺、情况堅固　北粳行情復硬角許、中宿者略挺蘆洋尖高料貨稀、形勢轉硬早晚稻到銷對敵、市無升沉、</p>
<p>▲滬北　昨日北市米情、各帮來源三四十號、内江陰·無錫帮最爲多數、城鄕店銷不見活絡、北粳到銷二淡、價照原盤、薄稻祗到七八號、客胃不活、本城去路略有形硬五分、蘆洋尖及埠尖三種受小絞米影響開盤降低一角、</p>
<h3>洋米本銷尙旺</h3>
<p>▲漢口帮略有問津</p>
<p>昨日洋米市况、因新有到頭、人心回軟、客帮雖有胃、乃亦趁機觀望、以待壓小後再行裝辦、故統市只有漢口帮辦去小絞六七百包、内地帮略爲問訉外、其他均無過問、但本街胃口尙濃、在市搜買甚力、市面始得由疲帶堅、行情與前市無大出入、計開出小絞米三千多包、價十元零二角半至十元、敏黨米一千包、價十元零五角七分、小絞糙米二百包、價九元四角、茄辣地糙米五百包、價九元半、小絞四月份四兩八錢三分、又五月份五兩零二分、各二百噸、價比前市較小、惟洋行仍無開出、仍係行家回籠交易也、客元開江西機元二百二十包、價十二元半、亦爲本街辦去云、</p>
<h3>客胃不動粉價下挫</h3>
<p>昨麵粉市况、交易平淡、行情下落、初以洋粉有小三四角、人心已屬望下、後以客帮胃口不動、南洋帮以該地戰事發生、人心惶惶、當地紛電止裝、一部分即擬在市售出、進戶觀望、開價即小、兵船回籠現棧單前日與五月期同售二兩零七分半、昨日祗二兩零六分二五、計落一分二五、五月期二兩零六分半、計落一分云、</p>
<h3>南北貨　大泡圓泉存告斷</h3>
<p>泉州大泡桂圓、邇來乏到、查市上各號存底統共已不上二百箱、爲數確屬有限、復據泉訉、存底業經斷檔、因自滬案發生以來、銷路至呆故所有存貨、均已配往寗波應銷、此間現僅零星開出、價比前略鬆一二兩、然以存底而論、後市當不致有大上落云、</p>
<h3>糖市　粗砂白交易尙暢</h3>
<p>昨日糖市公會市塲劃盤、初時荷糖二十四號粗砂白雖賣方喊漲、第買氣閒散、二方尙在相持中、旋高貨成交價十二兩九錢、於是普通貨價至十二兩八錢半、香港貨十二兩七錢、如有成交、趨勢穩秀、二十號中砂白十二兩五錢半、十號荷赤九兩八錢半、進出殊懈、市形平定、太古糖Ｂ嘜十六兩二錢半、ＤＹ嘜十五兩三錢、ＨＭ嘜十三兩七錢半、交易零落、市氣平穩之跡云、</p>
<h3>疋頭閃色華特呢市銷銳減</h3>
<p>閃色華特呢爲夏令暢銷之毛貨、豈知今庚走勢呆滯、祗川帮於上週間略有點綴外、别帮問訉亦少、且本街銷路、已成明日黄花、即先前所最風行之藍閃色、現亦毫無交易、際此商業艱難之時、其貨價已大大削低、尙不易脫手、昨頭號閃色華特呢、躉批每碼祗喊售三兩六錢、普通貨呌三兩一二錢、單面爲二兩五六錢云、</p>
<h3>五金　天津帮狂辦馬口鐵</h3>
<p>馬口鐵新近交易、十分暢旺、如蛋廠·製罐廠·烟公司等、相繼收辦、故成交異常熱鬧、而異軍突起之天津帮等、昨日亦狂辦不已、是以開出之貨爲數甚夥、行情因此飛黄騰達、刻市英貨九十磅售十兩、一百磅十一兩七錢半、美貨九十磅十三兩、一百磅十四兩二錢半、聞連日開出共有四五千箱之多、查來貨無多、致人心鞏固、後市標準大有再好之望云、</p>
<h3>法西釘實交益微</h3>
<p>五金交易、邇來除花色貨有點綴外、大宗買賣依然毫無、良以大結束期迫近、銀根緊急之影響耳、故欲求五金根本之發展、恐非過本月底後殊不易活潑耳、雖疇稱暢銷之法西釘、最近亦因買戶之有限、致市情萎靡、標準有步步下游之象、刻估八兩、比前市已跌落錢許、而大批訂交、其價聞尙可便宜云、</p>

<p>安氏爲朝鮮大姓。關係國家尤重。族多志士。曩者安重根刺殺伊藤博文。轟轟烈烈之舉。名播全球。今被捕之安昌浩。云即安重根之族叔。剏新民會。圖恢復國權。其志不在安重根下。聞安昌浩少時。刻苦自厲。讀書之餘。恒練習武事。鍜鍊身體。其初組新民會也。同志不過數十人。嘗於雪天。約儕輩。徒跣奔走山谷中。又舉火獵山。槍擊猛獸。即指山獸爲倭奴。名其大者爲大倭。小者爲小倭。有時擒獲山獸。拔刀刺血。瀝酒共飲。同聲高唱岳鄂王滿江紅詞曰。壯志飢餐胡虜肉。笑談渴飲匈奴血。唱畢。大笑擊掌。掌聲如雷。震巖谷。極悲壯淋漓之槪。又或仰天痛哭。橫臥敗葉亂草閒。愛國精誠。熱血噴湧。其能吸引一輩青年志士。宜哉。此前年同學霍君爲余言。謂其舅氏某先生。因考察日本敎育。順道赴韓。得晤彼黨中人。述安君大略如此。</p>
<h3>今日爲日本男童節</h3>
<p>— 葉華女士</p>

<p>▲項强</p>
<p>項强打虎山人。自幼膂力逾常。好習武。有奔牛狂逸。鄕人追之不及。適遇項强。摳衣而前。以雙手扳牛角。牛驚跳不得脫。遂縶之歸。由是神通之名大著。其父以項强雖勇。徒具蠻力而不諳武術。欲造就之。適有名敎師袁一飛自京師來。項父乃欵留在家。命其子請益焉。孰知項强年輕氣盛。傲睨一切。不肯拜師。遽謂袁曰。若能受我拳乎。袁笑曰。古有强項令。今有强項弟子。項强强項。誠不虛矣。乃袒衣屹然而立白。請試子拳。項强即一躍而前。舉拳猛擊。孰知拳中袁胸。軟若敗絮。不能傷其微末。不信。揮拳再擊。袁略一舉手。而項强已跌出丈外。將仆地。袁忽執以手曰止。乃得不倒。於是項强折服。願執弟子禮。隨袁學武術。袁愛其勇。因留其家敎之。逾年餘。項强已得袁技之大半。較前日之蠻勇已不可同日而語。袁遂别去。項强旣挾高深之武術。乃練民團。以保衛桑梓自任。蓋關東多盜。時患焚刦之苦也。項强自練民團後。曾擊破大股鬍匪。頗著威名。中日之戰。左寳貴戰死平壤。聶士成以孤軍堅守摩天嶺。能以少許勝。敵有戒心。項强聞之。奮袂而起曰。天生我一具銅筋鐵肋。當向沙塲立奇功去。揮我十萬橫磨劍。不殺倭奴誓不休。即日仗劍往投聶軍。但未幾馬關條約成。聶亦率其部下言旋。而項强仍隨聶去。其後庚子之役。聶士成戰死津沽。聞項强亦於斯時殉難云。</p>
<h3>戎馬雙樓記</h3>
<p>— 求幸福齋主人</p>
<p>第六回　可憐同夢夜迫爲床下盟　猶憶初戀時負郤窗間約</p>
<p>話說安玉田似騰雲駕霧般一交跌進一個溫柔鄕裏。彷彿此鄕神秘得難以名狀。直非現實的世界中所有。而另外搆造在一種桃色的雲中夢裏形成個極樂的别一世界。這世界時而感覺縮得極小。祗結晶般擠在一張錦包繡裹玉軟香溫的小小銅床上。但有時從發酵的腦細胞裏忽又展放得極大。大可以包括宇宙。縱橫六合。幻爲一種無邊無際不可思議的空闊。能使他整個靈魂。在這裏面自由自在的任意翺翔。無一處無一時不飽浸於最富滋養的玉露瓊漿那陶醉之中。獲得神仙們超凡絕俗的極樂。若是神游太虛。倦而思返。似嫌那幻景中太空疏了。立刻仍回到那小小銅床上的香衾裏。專尋實質的享受。那便空即是色。又包羅著萬千的色界。有玉體的橫陳。有鴛鴦的合抱。有鶯舌的巧囀。有蓮蒂的雙開。有乳氣的蒸薰。有肉香的濃馥。有星眸的宕漾。有笑語的呢喃。舉凡眼耳鼻舌身意。色聲香味觸法。都無不夠他鑠精。儘他蕩魄。足消受了一回平生所未曾經歷的最精緻的艶福。而不知不覺的銷耗了一叚很大的時間。及到春夢初回。彩雲遽歛。嬌聲輕喘。倦眼微疲。雙雙入於靜止的狀態。許多密惜深憐。都只於並頭共枕相對默然中。頻頻以撫抱示意。眞是不落言詮。而别有精微的妙諦。祇是安玉田究爲身經憂患的人，餘生暗澹。正愁得不着個着落。郤不料平白地會意外飛來這一步最美妙的桃花運。似做夢一般已躬受了美人一塲恩寵。這時凝神靜思。偷眼斜覷。只覺昏昏沈沈的說不情此夕何夕。此緣何緣。怎麽這樣一個天上仙姬般的妙人兒。會投在我這極不幸的窮苦人的懷抱裏。論緣法雖固屬可喜。而相形之下。衾影慚惶。終不免疚心於過奢及逾分的自責。然而大錯已經鑄成。此情又誰能輕遣。欲求補過。或更作長久的企圖。還在我自己往後多加努力。解除眼前這困難的束縛。</p>

<h3>執政妃</h3>
<p>— 金</p>
<p>昨見報載，日本東京某種慈善團體，致函趙欣伯，囑爲募捐，趙當向溥儀之妻，捐得洋千元，復函略謂，奉「執政妃命」，捐助貴會欵項若干云云，趙蓋以僞執政地位，比於日本之親王，故稱其妻爲妃，此函登載當地報章，爲溥妻所見，大爲震怒，以爲稱彼爲妃，則認爲妾媵地位，召趙面加詰責，經人解釋始已，</p>
<p>這一段醜歷史，原無討論的價値，不過稱后稱妃，原是專制魔王遺傳下來的稱謂，溥妻不滿意於稱妃，天然欲稱后了，但是溥儀旣稱執政，則其妻不該稱之爲后，不該稱之爲妃，只可稱之爲夫人，幷且對於異國的一個慈善團體，本來有什麽客氣，你們一般狐羣狗黨，對於自己僞君主，應該保持着尊嚴的地位，應該稱后儘管稱后，應稱夫人，儘管稱夫人，</p>
<p>趙欣伯曾經對鄭孝胥說，須知我們滿洲是少爺國，開門七件事，多有老爺執管，用不着自己張羅，趙旣說是少爺國天然還有老爺國，少爺對於老爺，自然是父子稱呼，若少爺國對於老爺國，則不免有君臣之别，自然要稱臣稱妾了，</p>
<p>前清大臣朝見皇上，則自稱奴才，故曾經有過一段笑話，有某大臣朝見光緒，因爲某大臣多看了稗官野史，小說書中，女子往往自稱奴家，某大臣脫口而出，對於光緒亦自稱奴家，其時光緒幾欲笑出來，只得把自己的指頭頂住，指頭甚至發紫，方免大笑，但是光緒亦並不深究，這一點已算是逾格鴻恩了，</p>
<p>自僞滿洲國成立以來，我也没有見過少爺國對於老爺國的皇皇詔勅，不知稱奴才呢，還是稱微臣？他日少爺去朝見老爺時，也算要把奴才誤稱了奴家！</p>

<p>辛風苦雨渡重洋，忍把蓬萊認故鄕，白馬䭾經原話柄，黄金滿斗助行裝，佞才人比荀文若，媚骨天生趙子昻，西望長安君不見，火焚車駕信堪傷，</p>
<p>其三</p>
<p>桃源三傑覃胡宋，狗敗龍亡虎獨雄，位置覬覦孫□□，官僚摹仿邵□□，殽陳前席珍肝紫，花發後庭玉樹紅，衣錦還鄕成幻想，岳陽船阻石尤風，</p>
<p>其四</p>
<p>附庸風雅盜虛聲，關内羊頭屬此君，祇解行權參令尹，也曾光桿作將軍，瓶中媚藥掀髯飲，袖底餘桃帶笑分，忽報寃禽銜宿怨，揮毫未竟淚濱粉，</p>
<p>其五</p>
<p>看罷桃花笑口開，龍華回首有餘哀，論功儘足稱元老，送禮居然署秀才，不肯折城誇上策，每從面壁懺飛災，在家僧比出家苦，聽鼓應官去復來，</p>

<h3>簡易的小印刷器</h3>
<p>— 工</p>
<p>從前我們所用的油印刷器，大多是舶來品，從九一八和一二八事變以後，我們在良心上想，是不容再買了，所以現在想出一只小的印刷器來代替，現在我說的印刷器是極小，但是我們平常祗需印數十張，却極適當，而且經濟，現在那牠的製造法寫在下面，</p>
<p>先那直辣的尼（Ｇelatine）即純粹的膠十兩，浸在冷水中，放一夜，使牠膨脹，明朝和甘油六十兩，（冬天七十兩）一同放在蒸發皿内，再加少許食鹽，然後煎煖牠，使牠完全溶解在水中，這時要當心攪拌，等氣泡完全没有的時候，可以加丁子油（Ｃolveoil）□數滴在内，防牠自然分解，那這溶液倒入扁平的鉛□皮盤内，等牠自然凝固，這樣印刷器就成功了，用在□這器上的墨汁，可以照下面自做，</p>
<p>先用阿尼林紫一兩，溶解在溫水十兩中，冷後加酒精一兩，甘油四兩，依的兒及石炭酸數滴，這樣黑墨水便成，若要紫色的，可用阿尼林紫一兩，溶解在熱水七兩中，他物完全相同，祗有甘油要减少二兩，照樣做就成，</p>
<p>用法　拿墨汁寫在光滑的紙上，等牠亁後，即拿牠覆在器上，用指頭摩擦二三回，等數分鐘，從一端剥離牠，這時字跡便留在器上，用白紙覆在上面，也摩擦數回，再剥離，白紙上即有同樣的字跡，這樣印法，黑墨汁可印四五十張，紫的可印七八十張，用後拿在熱水中浸過的海綿揩拭，器面字跡，立刻就落下，下回可同樣的應用，</p>

<h3>理髮館中隨感</h3>
<p>— 𢽾厂</p>
<p>「聞說頭須剃，人人盡剃頭，有頭皆可剃，無剃不成頭，剃是由他剃，頭還是我頭，請看剃頭者，人亦剃其頭，」</p>
<p>昨天往理髮館去「剃頭」，在靜悄悄修面孔的時候，想起這首名詩，忽然聯想到國内的政治和最近醞釀的郵費加價問題等等，使我由怕而更進一層底生出一些感觸，</p>
<p>理髮師眞是權威者，一個人入了理髮館之後，今日之事我爲政，祇可受權威者支配，不能和權威者結怨，我愈想愈危險，心中恐懼萬分，同時又不敢表示我的怯心，脫離剃刀的範圍，以致鬧出半面毛，半面光，的笑話，我心中雖焦急，但是除出靜候剃刀光臨，橫刮直刨以外没有辦法，我一時又想到别的問題上去，得了一個結論，最好不做人，</p>

<h3>少爺階級</h3>

<p>這勢力，就是一般的少爺階級！少爺們每日的工作，是擦亮皮鞋，燙硬領頭，粉塗面皮，油膠頭髮，發起議論來，滔滔然，會使人聽得莫名其妙！走起路來，高視闊步，沾沾自喜，同時也瞻前顧後，生怕衣裳已經皺着，减却了漂亮的度數，………唉！這種現象，似乎於河山破碎的國情，太不相稱了！我們竭誠希望，亦與國家共榮辱的一般少爺們，回過頭來，立刻加入國難工作，趨向全國動員，一致禦侮的目的，那才不愧爲炎黄子孫哩！</p>

<h3>關帝老爺</h3>
<p>— 毓賢</p>
<p>離上海七十里的某鄕，在戰事上劃爲第二道防線，沉靜的午夜，可以聽見上海激戰時的砲聲，所以稍爲富有之家，都向全安地避難去，街上兩個人相遇，第一句就會談到戰事上的預測，茶樓，酒肆，當然是談論的大本營了，在這樣騷擾的情形之下，宣傳出三國裏的關老爺，在上海助戰的謠言。</p>
<p>謠言發生的下半天，全鄕的民衆，都相聚在凈土橋畔，爭先恐後的求關老爺保護他們全鄕的生命財産。</p>
<p>關帝老爺靜靜地坐在佛龕裏，不笑，也不動，聽見衆口一詞的關帝老爺！關帝老爺！關帝老爺大怒。</p>
<p>關帝老爺附在一個小孩身上說。</p>
<p>自我坐在這裏後，没有一個人也没有一個鬼隷屬於我的，你們今天來幹什麽？中日開戰我不知道，况且已不是匹馬單刀的時代了，我不能保護你們，你們還是求你們的政府去。</p>
<p>三天後，大衆喧鬧着關帝老爺附魂在小孩身上，要三千雙草鞋，說陰兵走不來上海的馬路。</p>

<h3>上海素描之一</h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>丨丨商品化和尙</p>
<p>爲了劉老太太的陰壽，賬房漆先生得像煞介事的跑到××路杭州××寺上海行院去。未走近院門的時候，遠遠地便望着褪了色的紅牆，塗着漆黑的兩尺平方的大字，甚至於和「當」「官醬」一樣醒目。那上面除了「招牌」之外還有電話×××××號寫着在。他想「早知道這裏有電話，到不爲打個電話來方便得多了。」</p>
<p>踏進廟門，一個五十九歲和尙笑盈盈地迎了上來，合着十口裏念着「阿彌陀佛！」</p>
<p>「後天是劉家老太太的六十陰壽，要請你們費神費神了。」漆先生說明了來意，</p>
<p>「阿彌陀佛！不知道要幾個人？」這是主人的笑臉。</p>
<p>「十六個人夠了。請問多少錢一個人？」</p>
<p>「啊！我們這裏不比旁的地方，我們是杭州××寺分來的。譬如說我們做事非常認眞，說好了幾本經就是幾本經的，决不偷懶。而且我們的「行頭」都是嶄新的，假如是大出喪的話，確是非常冠冕。……」</p>
<p>「哼！」漆先搶着接下去說：「是的，這個我是知道的。你們這裏的人多，而且行頭也很排塲，否則我也就不來勞駕了。」</p>
<p>「是的呀！施主是非常明白的。就像去年宋×長的老太太出殯也是我們去的，××路的馬公路，××路的史公館，那一個大闊老家裏不是我們去？哈哈！」</p>
<p>漆先生一面邊應着一面在週圍打量打量，於是一陣笑聲之後他再欽羨的說：</p>
<p>「你們廟裏的裝飾到是頂好的哩」。</p>
<p>「好說好說，總算麻麻糊過得眼就是。我想馬上在門口再裝一個電氣招牌。也像南京路的「南無阿彌陀佛」那樣，可是聽說是很貴的哩。」</p>
<p>「啊！是的是的！現在什麽東西都貴「哩。」這是漆賬房的嘆聲。其後他記得還未說到本題，於是他再提醒說：</p>
<p>「那末眞的是多少錢一個人的呢？」</p>
<p>「不瞞施主說；我們要五元一個。」</p>
<p>「嗎？太貴太貴！」</p>
<p>「那末你先生說幾元一個呢？實在我們的開消眞大。你曉得在上海討口飯吃眞是不容易哪。」</p>
<p>「我想頂多是兩元一個」這是陳先生的還價。</p>
<p>「先生！公公道道說；四元錢一個。」</p>
<p>漆先生還是來不到這樣的價錢，於是開始向門外走去。</p>
<p>「頂多是三元，怎樣？」漆先生快走到門口再說。在他想想「和尙廟是多得很。」可是和尙終於没有回答，於是他走出了門檻。十幾步之後，他却聽到和尙的喚聲；</p>
<p>「來罷來罷！麻麻糊糊，就算三元！」</p>
<p>於是漆先生不得不回頭。他們的交易做好。</p>

<h3>National Non-War Movement</h3>
<p>— Bin</p>
<p>In recent years, successive wars have brought hardship to the country and its people. Powerful neighbors are watching for opportunities, and unexpected disasters are erupting, plunging our nation into a precarious state of danger and near-extinction. Patriotic individuals, alarmed by the looming threat of national demise and racial extinction, have largely advocated for "implementing a national non-war movement" to halt wars. Some have even proposed concrete measures for fellow citizens to jointly implement this initiative, expressing their abhorrence of war and love of peace, as well as their patriotic zeal for national planning. Their sincerity is highly commendable. However, we still feel there are several points that require further elaboration and supplementation. Therefore, we raise them for common discussion and deliberation among people nationwide.</p>
<p>Since the founding of the Republic of China, our nation has been plagued by the flames of warlord infighting. They fight for cities, resulting in countless deaths within city walls; they fight for land, leading to widespread deaths across the fields. The nation's foundation has been shaken, the people's livelihood has been devastated, and foreign adversaries have seized the opportunity to encroach further, controlling our nation's destiny. As we today reflect on the brutality and devastation of the past twenty years of warfare, and simultaneously consider the future of our nation and people, learning from past mistakes to prevent future ones, we cannot help but strongly oppose this internal war that fundamentally undermines our nation's vitality, and we must thoroughly eradicate it from its roots. However, we believe that the rise and fall of warlords and the incessant internal warfare since the founding of the Republic of China are not accidental. There must be underlying causes that have led to this. In other words, there must be a social backdrop that has contributed to it. Broadly speaking, the social economy remains stagnant at the stage of a continuously decaying and declining "feudal economy." Governing power is built upon feudal extraction relationships such as taxes. This is the economic backdrop that allows warlords to emerge. Imperialists, to facilitate their aggression against colonies, inevitably co-opt warlords as their tools and proxies, aiming to create a fragmented and disunited situation in our country, preventing it from unifying and establishing a consolidated and powerful central government. This is also the international backdrop that allows warlords to survive. Dividing territories and maintaining armies, with balanced power, may allow for temporary peace. However, when power is unbalanced, they fight to seize fertile land, to capture prosperous cities, and to control financial revenue-generating institutions. In essence, they fight to expand their sphere of influence and enlarge the area of extraction. Underlying conflicts will inevitably erupt and lead to war. Furthermore, international imperialists, each pursuing their own interests, instigate and fuel the conflict, providing arms and lending military expenses. In other words, they transform international wars into internal wars within our country. Defeated once, they regroup and return. If the inherent contradictions of capitalism are not resolved, the conflicts and infighting between them will manifest as internal warlord warfare within our country. This is an inevitable outcome, and it is the root cause of the continuous internal warfare in our country.</p>
<p>Having understood this root cause, we also know that warlords cannot be overthrown by mere "non-cooperation," and warlord warfare cannot be eliminated by a "non-war movement." If the people cannot express strong resistance through positive and effective actions, and fundamentally undermine the economic backdrop from which warlords arise and the backers upon whom they depend, then those who oppose will simply oppose, and those who fight will simply fight. Under the oppression of the "non-peaceful" powerful, how can "peaceful" "non-cooperation" persist unyielding? If it yields to the powerful, then the so-called non-war is nothing more than a utopian dream. If war could be stopped and contained by written treaties and agreements, then the First World War in Europe would never have broken out. And today's international peace movements, such as disarmament conferences and non-aggression pacts, would have already achieved satisfactory results. The world would have long celebrated perpetual peace. The reason they have not is due to the inherent contradictions of the social system.</p>
<p>Therefore, we believe that today, while people should absolutely reject internal war, a "peaceful non-war movement" will not yield effective results. If we wish to fundamentally eliminate war and achieve lasting peace, we should seek other effective paths. Maintaining the status quo of peace is a peace of temporary ease, a peace of falsehood, not a lasting peace. This is what we should clearly recognize and grasp today.</p>

Guo Taiqi, the chief representative of our side, has not yet recovered from his injuries and cannot attend. Zhang Si Xu, Director of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, will represent him. Military representatives Dai Ji and Huang Qiang will attend as before. Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu will also be represented by Secretary Okazaki, and Division Commander Ueda will be represented by Chief of Staff Tashiro. The representatives of the friendly nations will remain the same. The meeting this morning will not be very long. After solemnly reviewing and passing the original text of the agreement, the formal signing will proceed. Vice Minister Guo, Shigemitsu, and Ueda are all in the hospital, and the agreement will be sent to the beds of the three representatives for signing. Our translated version was typed and transcribed until 1:00 this morning before it was completed. The Japanese translation is being handled by the Japanese side.</p>
<p>▲ Special Protection by the Police Yesterday, British Minister Lampson, because the Chinese and Japanese representatives were injured, and today is the day of signing, and the meeting is important, in order to prevent unexpected incidents, specially notified the Public Concession Bureau yesterday that the police should be sent to the meeting place today for special protection. It is also heard that the front and rear doors of the British Consulate will be closed during the meeting, and no one will be allowed to enter unless they have important business to discuss with the Consulate.</p>
<p>▲ After the Agreement is Signed The first step after the ceasefire agreement is officially signed is to organize a joint committee to verify the withdrawal of troops. The representatives of the joint committee will be local authorities. It is heard that the Chinese side will be Mayor Wu and Chief of Staff Huang. The Japanese side will be Consul General Murai and Chief of Staff Tashiro. The friendly nations will be represented by the consuls general and military attaches of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and Italy. The second step is that, according to the agreement, the Japanese army will begin withdrawing from the front line within one week to the designated four locations of Zhabei, Jiangwan, Yinxiang, and Wusong, and the withdrawal must be completed within four weeks. The third step is for the municipal government to take over the administration of the areas withdrawn by the Japanese army. Since the administration of the areas withdrawn by the Japanese army involves political issues, it is not explicitly stipulated in the agreement. Only a collateral declaration is issued by our side, stating that our police will be dispatched to maintain order in the areas withdrawn by the Japanese army. The fourth step is for the joint committee to verify when the Japanese army finally withdraws to its original defense line before January 28, since the final withdrawal deadline of the Japanese army is not explicitly stipulated in the agreement.</p>
<p>▲ Content of the Agreement Reported by the Japanese Side The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun translated by the Foreign Affairs Review Agency states that the full text of the five articles and four attached documents of the Sino-Japanese ceasefire agreement, as decided by the条文整理 committee on the 27th, is as follows: "Sino-Japanese Ceasefire Agreement" Article 1: In order to make the formal ceasefire between the Chinese and Japanese armies and the ceasefire a reality, both China and Japan shall cease all forms of hostile actions against each other from ○ month ○ day.

The nearby areas to the right will be specified in the attached document. Article 4: To confirm the implementation of the above articles, a mixed committee shall be established. The maintenance of public order after the withdrawal shall be the responsibility of the Chinese special police. Article 5: This agreement shall take effect from ○ month ○ day.

The special police shall be organized by 1,500 Chinese trained police officers, who shall recruit advisors and experts. Advisors and experts may be recruited from among foreigners.</p>
<h3>Various Groups Continue to Petition for the Publication of the Full Text of the Agreement</h3>
<p>▲ The United Association of People's Organizations Issues a Circular Opposing It</p>
<p>The United Association of Shanghai Organizations held an emergency representative conference at Jing'an Villa yesterday afternoon. More than 30 representatives from various organizations attended. Chu Huiseng was elected as chairman. First, the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting, and then Li Cishan, Wu Shan, Xie Chengzhong, and others successively reported the reasons for the conflict at Guo's residence the previous morning and the efforts to contact Xia Qifeng to bail out the arrested representatives. It was briefly stated that regarding the reasons for the conflict at Guo's residence the previous morning, the reports in yesterday's newspapers varied. Now, I will briefly report what I personally witnessed that day. When Mr. Guo came out to meet the representatives, the conflict suddenly arose during the question-and-answer session for two reasons. First, because Mr. Guo stated that the phrase "cessation of hostilities around Shanghai" stipulated in the agreement had been changed to "cessation of hostilities near Shanghai." I personally believed that the change was satisfactory, but some representatives believed that the word "near" still had an unlimited scope and fundamentally conflicted with the issue of not stationing troops in Pudong and Nanshi, so they could not consider it satisfactory. Therefore, the two sides argued for about 20 minutes. Second, because Mr. Guo stated that if a treaty that humiliated the nation and ceded its rights was signed, he could be held responsible. Before he finished speaking, someone in the back said, "You cannot bear such a heavy responsibility," followed by a teacup hitting Mr. Guo's forehead. As for the person who committed the assault, because there were many people, I did not pay attention. After the report was completed, important cases were discussed, and the following resolutions were immediately made: (1) Regarding the case of how the association should express itself when the Sino-Japanese ceasefire agreement is about to be signed, it was resolved that (A) a letter should be sent to Guo Taiqi requesting that the entire agreement and its attachments be published immediately for public study and approval before signing; (B) a public statement should be issued (including the two previous telegrams and Wang Jingwei's telegram). (2) Chu Huiseng, Hu Shuhua, Lin Shuofu, and Wu Shan were appointed as representatives to visit Guo Taiqi, Dai Ji, and Huang Qiang, the three representatives of the peace talks, to inquire about the agreement. The letter to Guo Taiqi stated: "Respected Sir, in recent days, Chinese and foreign newspapers have carried various and different records of the Sino-Japanese ceasefire agreement and its attached documents. In particular, Japanese newspapers have spread various shocking news, such as that the agreement or China's separate statement stipulates that no troops will be stationed in Pudong and Nanshi, that the Japanese army will withdraw from the area, and that foreign police officers and Chinese police officers will train the police. In oral rumors from foreigners, it is also said that no troops will be stationed within 30 kilometers near Shanghai, which has also been determined. Our government and diplomatic representatives have not denied these rumors, and the general public is extremely disturbed. Your Excellency has allowed the representatives of this association to review the contents before the signing in the future. The representatives of this association are very appreciative of your frankness. Now that the agreement is about to be signed, we intend to ask your Excellency to make every effort to publish the details of the process and the text of the agreement and its attached documents within the scope possible so that the society can have a considerable understanding before the establishment of the agreement, which will be of great benefit to the diplomatic process."</p>
<p>The United Association of Shanghai People's Organizations issued a circular opposing the humiliating agreement, stating: "To all compatriots across the country, the outbreak of the Shanghai War was initiated by Japan. Right and wrong are clear to the international community. Our government first harmed the country by not aiding Shanghai and is now ceding its rights by signing a humiliating treaty. This association adheres to the principle of national liberation and speaks out righteously, vowing to oppose compromise. We hereby inform our compatriots of the following six points: (1) Restricting the Chinese army undermines the integrity of sovereignty. According to the terms of the agreement, one term states that hostilities will cease around Shanghai, another states that both sides will withdraw, and a third states that the Chinese army is limited to stationing in its current location. This clearly restricts the Chinese army from stationing in the vicinity of Shanghai and Wusong. Chinese territory is not allowed to station Chinese troops, but the Japanese have designated areas for stationing troops. This is the most extreme example of inverting the power. Taking responsibility for public security with the police of various countries is a gradual start to joint management and partition. Ceding rights and humiliating the nation, undermining the integrity of territorial sovereignty, and willingly treating ourselves as a defeated country, the consequences are unimaginable. This is what our people should vow to oppose one. (2) Designating areas and allowing permanent stationing of Japanese troops. According to the terms of this agreement, the four places of Wusong, Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Yinxiang on our territory are designated as areas for Japanese troops to be stationed. This means that the Japanese are invading our territory, and we are actually explicitly allowing them to have the right to station troops. How is this different from the Qing Dynasty selling out the country? This is what our people should vow to oppose two. (3) Uncertain deadline for withdrawal, diplomacy is often threatened. The League of Nations resolved to order the withdrawal of Japanese troops, originally hoping that the sooner the better. The Japanese are actually taking the opportunity to create chaos under the pretext of restoring normalcy. There will never be a withdrawal date, and they will inevitably coerce our government into signing all kinds of traitorous treaties. The so-called policy of long-term resistance is a deceitful and misleading statement, and it will abandon the compatriots of the three provinces to groan under the iron heel of the Japanese. This is what our people should vow to oppose three. (4) Local ceasefire, suitable for the enemy's tricks. After the violent Japan occupied the Northeast, they established the puppet state of Manchukuo and Mongolia as a prelude to the implementation of annexation. Now, the armed people and enlightened soldiers in various parts of the Northeast have raised the banner of resistance one after another following the victory of the Shanghai War, controlling the enemy's lifeline. Violent Japan has therefore changed its strategy, intending to stop the Shanghai War first in order to conquer the righteous army in the Eastern Province and at the same time coerce our government to submit and recognize it. The so-called long-term resistance policy is a deceitful and misleading statement, and it will abandon the compatriots of the three provinces to groan under the iron heel of the Japanese. This is what our people should vow to oppose four. (5) Humiliating compromise loses international sympathy. The special conference of the League of Nations resolved to order the withdrawal of Japanese troops, originally without any conditions. The new draft of the nineteen-member state resolution sets up a hybrid committee, originally stipulating the power to decide the deadline for withdrawal by majority vote. The spirit of the content of today's agreement completely violates the previous two resolutions. It is as if the sympathy of the international majority is discarded like dung, and the unlawful coercion of violent Japan is accepted as if it were nectar. The so-called trusting in the diplomatic claims of the League of Nations is even more of a self-deceiving talk. This is what our people should vow to oppose five. (6) External humiliation, internal war. Since the September 18th Incident, Ning and Yue have been calling on each other to go to the national crisis together and unite against foreign enemies."</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>"If a humiliating agreement is signed now, it will inevitably lead to the ceding of national rights. All patriotic compatriots will inevitably be filled with righteous indignation and rise up in resistance to seek a way to save the country. On the government side, if they adhere to the compromise, they will inevitably do their best to suppress the threats in order to maintain their power. As a result, the people and the government will go in opposite directions, and the country will enter a turbulent situation, which will lead to the disaster of national subjugation and racial extinction. This is what our people should vow to oppose six. Alas, the enemy is deep, and the matter is urgent. Signing a humiliating agreement today will lead to signing a treaty of national subjugation tomorrow, just like the fall of Korea, all from the same mold. This association, in view of this, makes a painful statement, and righteousness brooks no turning back. I hope that all sectors of the country will work together to turn the tide and rise up to save themselves."</p>
<h3>Guo Taiqi Was Hospitalized for Treatment Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Wang Jingwei and Others Sent Telegrams of Condolence</p>
<p>Guo Taiqi, the chief representative of our side in the Sino-Japanese ceasefire conference, was suddenly assaulted and injured by petitioning representatives at 9:20 a.m. the day before yesterday. Mr. Guo bled a lot and was immediately treated by Dr. Miles Ayer (erroneously reported as Miles Ayre yesterday) of the German Hospital, who instructed him to rest quietly. Therefore, he immediately stopped seeing guests. However, the day before yesterday evening, Mr. Guo's wound suddenly ached, and he had a fever. At 8:30 yesterday morning, Dr. Miles was re-invited to treat him. Dr. Miles then advised that he must be hospitalized for treatment in order to avoid noise and recover sooner. Therefore, after a brief examination, he was accompanied by Dr. Miles and Mrs. Guo, Ms. Xu Dequan, to a certain hospital for treatment at around 9:00. It is rumored that it was at the Lester Chinese Hospital on Avenue Joffre.</p>
<p>▲ Statement from the Foreign Affairs Office Yesterday, the Secretary's Office of the Foreign Affairs Office issued a statement saying that after Vice Minister Guo was injured by rioters at 9:00 yesterday morning, the wound was very deep and bled a lot. He immediately asked a doctor to treat him and rested in bed. He did not receive any members of the press. A certain newspaper reported that Vice Minister Guo expressed three points to the French chief inspector, which was a misreport.</p>
<p>▲ Dai, Huang, and Others Visited Yesterday morning, Garrison Commander Dai Ji and Chief of Staff Huang Qiang of the 19th Route Army went to Guo's residence to inquire about his illness. Because Mr. Guo's wound had not yet recovered, fearing that he would exert himself, they could not say much, so they bid farewell after a few words. Also, at 10:00 a.m. yesterday, Spanish Consul General Ferlein dispatched Deputy Consul Lelong Kaijin to the Shanghai Intelligence Department of the Foreign Ministry to express condolences. Central Committee member Kong Xiangxi also bought a bouquet of flowers and went to Guo's residence to express condolences at around 10:00 a.m.</p>
<p>▲ Wang and Others Sent Telegrams of Condolence Nanjing, 3rd Telegram: Wang Jiang telegram to Dai Ji and Huang Qiang on the 3rd: Vice Minister Guo was attacked and injured by rioters this morning, which is extremely concerning. This time, Fuchu and the two brothers have been negotiating at the ceasefire conference, unyielding and resolute. All the details of the conference have been reviewed by the Central Party Department and the government, which consider it to be upholding the overall situation and not humiliating the mission. Now that Brother Fuchu has been injured on official duty, we deeply hope that he can recover soon and resume his duties as usual. We also hope that the two brothers will take care of the overall situation and proceed calmly, which is of utmost importance. Also, Wang Jingwei, Luo Wengan, Huang Shaoxiong, Chen Mingshu, He Yingqin, Chen Shaokuan, Chen Gongbo, and Gu Mengyu telegraphed Guo on the 3rd, saying: Brother, you have been negotiating at the ceasefire conference with a bright attitude, which is not only admired by colleagues, but also trusted by people's organizations. Now that you have been injured on official duty, your brothers feel deeply grieved in terms of public righteousness and friendship. Please take good care of yourself and recover your health as soon as possible. We pray for you. Also, Luo Wengan and Xu Mo telegraphed Guo, saying: I have just learned that you have been injured on official duty. I have already reported it to Wang. Colleagues in the government are willing to provide strong support. Please rest assured and recuperate, and we hope for your early recovery. Also, the wife of Dean Wang sent a telegram to Guo's wife, saying: Guo Fuchu's wife at 2 Lauri Road, Shanghai, I have heard that Mr. Fuchu has been injured on official duty, which is deeply concerning. I hereby send a telegram of condolence, Chen Bijun Jiang.</p>
<p>▲ Wang Orders the Mayor Nanjing, 3rd Telegram: Wang telegraphed Mayor Wu Tiecheng of Shanghai on the evening of the 3rd, saying: I have just received a telegram from Zhang Sixu, Director of the Intelligence Department of the Foreign Ministry, stating that this morning, Vice Minister Guo Taiqi was attacked in his private residence by several thugs dressed as students when he was meeting with representatives claiming to be from various Shanghai organizations, resulting in a forehead injury and bleeding, etc. After hearing this, I was deeply shocked. Vice Minister Guo served as the chief representative of the Shanghai ceasefire conference this time, and he has been diligent in his duties. All the details of the conference have been reported to the government, which has carefully reviewed them and considers that he has upheld the overall situation and has not humiliated the mission. Even the genuine organizations in Shanghai have expressed their trust in Vice Minister Guo to the government and have appealed for his temporary transfer to be suspended so that he can see it through to the end. However, a small number of thugs, harboring evil intentions, dared to launch a surprise attack, which is extremely outrageous. Mayor, you should immediately investigate and identify the thugs who committed the crime, escort them to court, and conduct a strict interrogation. If it was instigated by illegal organizations, those organizations should be disbanded immediately, and the masterminds should be strictly investigated to serve as a warning to others. Do not disobey this order.</p>
<p>▲ Arrests Released The 11 people arrested by the French police the day before yesterday, including Yin Zhiling, Li Cishan, Yang Rongwei, Xie Chengping, Shen Zuru, Jiang Yizhi, Wu Xi, Ni Cishan, Fan Xueqin, Tian Yuankai, and Jiang Yongda, except for Li Cishan and Yin Zhiling, who were immediately released on bail, the other nine people were detained at the Lujiawan Police Station. After investigation by the police station, since the assailants had all escaped at that time, and the arrested people were actually representatives of the organization, and Mr. Guo expressed that he did not want to pursue the matter further, the arrested people were completely released at 1:00 a.m. yesterday.</p>
<p>▲ The People Question Wang A telegram from various people's organizations questioning Wang Jingwei (excerpt above) says: "Today's newspaper reports that Mr. Wang is talking about taking responsibility for the Shanghai case, which is deeply surprising. The reports in various newspapers and the Shanghai News about Mr. Guo's assault yesterday clearly indicate that it was caused by the righteous indignation of patriotic people and Mr. Guo's improper answers, and the fundamentally humiliating draft ceasefire agreement. Mr. Wang said that this attack was carried out by three or five people harboring evil intentions who disregarded the law and acted recklessly. We do not know what facts prove the so-called harboring evil intentions. Is it because they oppose the humiliating agreement? Is the national salvation movement reckless? Were the representatives who met with Mr. Guo at that time thugs? Is Mr. Wang's so-called long-term resistance turning into permanent non-resistance? Is he using alarming words to condemn people? This is the first question. Mr. Wang said that genuine people's organizations have also expressed their trust. We do not know how many people's organizations in Shanghai there are, no less than three or four hundred. Who is genuine and who is not? He also said that at the same time, he received a winter telegram from the United Association of Shanghai Organizations. Has he forgotten that the organization that issued the winter telegram is the organization that expressed trust in Mr. Guo before? Mr. Wang called them genuine people because he saw that they supported the humiliating terms, but he called those who criticized them too bizarre. He is clearly distinguishing between people and insulting them arbitrarily without any standards. This is the second question. Mr. Wang said that those who hide in the concession and make it their business to disrupt the law should be severely punished to quell their arrogance. We do not know which of the more than three million residents of the concession are disrupting the law (excerpt omitted). This is the third question. During the peace conference between Ning and Yue, Mr. Wang used the people of Shanghai to support Mr. Wang and others in holding meetings in the Shanghai concession, but he sternly rebuked Shen Junru, who opposed holding meetings in the concession, calling them world revolutionaries. Now he is falsely accusing the people who are saving the country with dishonorable words. How can there be such contradictions? This is the fourth question. The branch of the United Association of Shanghai People's Organizations,"</p>
<h3>Telegram for Comforting Jiang and Cai</h3>
<p>▲Jiangsu National Crisis Committee Telegram</p>
<p>The Jiangsu National Crisis Relief Society telegraphed the National Government, addressed to Chairman Lin, President Wang, and Chairman Jiang of the Nanjing National Government: "We are utterly dismayed to learn from reports of the resignations of Jiang Guangnai, Chief Commander, and Cai Tingkai, Military Commander, of the 19th Route Army. The Shanghai-Songhu Campaign, a bitter struggle lasting over a month, has shocked the world and inspired the nation. The 19th Route Army's ability to rise up with loyalty and courage, disregarding personal safety, relied on the apt command and effective control of its leaders. Such pillars of the state cannot be easily replaced. Now that the government has repeatedly expressed its determination to resist in the long term, at a time when the armistice talks are constantly changing and the enemy's insidious plans continue unabated, how can we undermine our own Great Wall, causing grief to our allies and joy to our enemies? If such a thing were to happen, we earnestly implore you to consider the daily increasing danger to the nation and the difficulty in finding capable generals, and to sincerely persuade them to stay, so that they can focus on administering the army and serving the country. The life of the nation is about to be severed. Hundreds of millions of people are willing to shed their blood and tears and exhaust all their strength to protect the national army, for no other reason than to extend this slender thread of life that has not yet been extinguished, and to prevent ourselves and our descendants from becoming subjugated slaves. The right and wrong are clear to everyone, and our likes and dislikes are shared by all. We ask you to heed the will of the people. This telegram is urgent. We respectfully await your wise instruction. Respectfully, the Jiangsu National Crisis Relief Society."</p>

<h3>Case of Japanese Troops Arbitrarily Arresting Workers</h3>
<p>▲Tang Yinxiang and 14 Others Injured</p>
<p>▲General Labor Union Requests the Municipal Government to Protest</p>
<p>▲Released After Negotiation by the Shanghai Municipal Council</p>
<p>Tang Yinxiang and 25 other workers of the Nanyang Printing Company on Tiantong Road in Hongkou were arrested by armed Japanese soldiers on the evening of the 2nd. The Ratepayers' Association sent a letter to the Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council for investigation. Yesterday, the company's labor union sent representatives to petition the Municipal Government. The General Labor Union also held a meeting to discuss the matter. It is now reported that the arrested workers have been released by the police, but most of them were injured. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲Japanese Military Trial: The list of workers arrested by armed Japanese soldiers is as follows: Tang Yinxiang, Pan Bingrong, Xu Haofang, Xu Haoming, Liu Zhaojun, Cheng Yuelin, Sun Jiazi, Feng Fengrui, Zhang A'gen, Gao Xilin, Sun Heqing, Tang Hailin, Tang Tingsheng, Chen Fuqing, Jiang Zenggen, Xue Maode, Cai Wenting, Shao Meisheng, Xuan Baiqing, Xin Yongkang, Sun Jiaming, Fang Yingxiong, and others, totaling 25 people. They were first taken to the Japanese headquarters and tried by Japanese military officers. Statements were recorded and they were detained inside the headquarters.</p>
<p>▲Negotiations for Release: After receiving the letter from the Ratepayers' Association, the Shanghai Municipal Council immediately sent personnel to investigate the truth. The Japanese side claimed that the reason for the arrest was that a Zhiyang Foreign Firm, opened by Japanese, was located behind the Nanyang Printing Company, and the Chinese workers of the printing company were throwing lead type and waste materials into the foreign firm from upstairs. After failed attempts to stop them, the headquarters was notified, and troops were sent to make the arrests. Later, after negotiations by the Shanghai Municipal Council, the 25 arrested people were sent to the Minhang Road police station. The injured workers were sent by the police station to the Shanghai Municipal Council Hospital for examination of injuries. They were released at 7 p.m. the day before yesterday. It is reported that Tang Yinxiang and 14 others suffered injuries of varying degrees and sought treatment at Renji Hospital yesterday.</p>
<p>▲Request for Protest: The Lead Printing Industry Union sent representatives, including Zou Ronglin, to the Municipal Government at 4 p.m. yesterday to petition for a strong protest to the Shanghai Municipal Council and severe negotiations with the Japanese Consul. They demanded that similar incidents not occur again in the future and that the Japanese government issue a prompt apology, punish the perpetrators, and compensate for the losses.</p>
<p>▲Meeting for Assistance: After receiving the report from the Lead Printing Industry Union, the General Labor Union held a regular meeting at 2 p.m. yesterday at No. 117 Fuyou Road to discuss assistance to the arrested lead printing workers. Resolutions included: (1) sending a letter to the Ratepayers' Association requesting a protest to the Shanghai Municipal Council; (2) submitting a petition to the Municipal Government requesting protests to the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Japanese Consul; (3) sending the injured workers to the Labor Hospital; (4) sending personnel to comfort the injured workers; and (5) issuing a declaration of assistance.</p>
<p>▲Rescue by Merchants and Citizens: The Hongkou district branches of the Citizens' United Association and the joint offices of Broadway Road, Yangshupu Road, Xihua Road, North Jiangxi Road, Suzhou Road, Haining Road, Hanbury Road, Tiantong Road, Fuqing Road, Wuchang Road and other organizations convened an emergency joint representative meeting at 2 p.m. yesterday regarding the kidnapping of Nanyang Printing Company workers by Japanese troops, to discuss rescue measures and to stop the violent and illegal actions of the Japanese troops in order to maintain public order. It was resolved to forward a letter to the City United Association for serious handling. Furthermore, since Hongkou has not yet reopened for business and such unfortunate incidents are occurring, it is even more disheartening. Therefore, representatives Zhang Yichen, Jiang Junyi, Zhou Fuzhang, and others were specially appointed to negotiate with the Shanghai Municipal Council.</p>
<p>▲Letter from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce: Regarding the arbitrary arrest of employees of the Nanyang Printing Company in the International Settlement by Japanese troops, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council, urging prompt negotiations with the Japanese side to maintain public safety. The original letter stated: "To the esteemed Council, We received a letter from the Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai on the 4th of this month, stating that, according to a letter from Jin Shunqing, an executive committee member of our association, the Nanyang Printing Company, managed by the undersigned, was suddenly raided by a large number of Japanese troops around 10 p.m. last night, and more than 20 employees and apprentices were arrested without any clear reason, causing the printing operations to be suspended. We request your assistance in negotiating a resolution. We have investigated and found that the Japanese troops are acting rampantly, and our countrymen are suffering without recourse to justice. At a time when the armistice talks are about to resume, the Japanese troops have once again intruded into the company without reason and arbitrarily detained employees, which is detrimental to public order. In view of the above, we urge you to promptly negotiate with the Shanghai Municipal Council for the release of the arrested employees and request a guarantee that such incidents will not occur again in the future, in order to maintain commerce and so on. We have found that the Japanese troops have repeatedly arrested merchants and residents within the Settlement when provoking incidents, and we have repeatedly requested your Police Department to negotiate their release. Now that the Sino-Japanese armistice talks are about to be concluded, the Japanese troops are still arbitrarily arresting personnel from the Nanyang Printing Company, inciting negative feelings among the Chinese and disrupting the peace and order of the Settlement. We cannot allow this situation to persist. Based on the above, we respectfully request your Council to investigate and take action to negotiate for their release and to make every effort to prevent such incidents from happening again in the future, in order to maintain public safety. We would be deeply grateful."</p>

<h3>Full Text of the League of Nations Inquiry Commission's Preliminary Report</h3>
<p>Military Intelligence on Dong Province Provided by the Japanese Side</p>
<p>Methods for Restoring Peace and Security Still Under Consideration</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The League of Nations Inquiry Commission's preliminary report, disclosed in full on the 4th, is as follows:</p>
<p>Part One</p>
<p>This Inquiry Committee, having been appointed in accordance with Section 5 of the resolution of the Executive Yuan of December 10, arrived in Shenyang on April 21 and is now engaged in on-site investigations. Since arriving in the Far East, the Committee has inquired into the general situation between China and Japan, insofar as it relates to its own work. The Committee has traveled to Tokyo, Osaka, Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, Tianjin, and Beijing, where it met with government officials from both countries and received representatives from various relevant sectors in both countries. In Beijing, it met with representatives of the authorities in charge of the northeastern provinces prior to September 19. Since arriving in Shenyang, it has met with the acting Japanese Consul General, General Honjo, Commander of the Kwantung Army, and other personnel. According to the Chairman of the Executive Yuan's declaration regarding the December 10 resolution, the Committee, upon arrival at the local area, shall prepare a preliminary report as soon as possible and submit it to the Executive Yuan regarding the current situation insofar as it relates to whether the Chinese and Japanese governments are fulfilling certain assurances contained in the September 30 resolution and reiterated in the December 10 resolution. These assurances are: (1) The Japanese government shall "continue to withdraw its troops as quickly as possible to within the railway zone, in proportion to the extent that the safety of the lives and property of the Japanese people is effectively guaranteed"; (2) The Chinese government "shall be responsible for the safety of the lives and property of Japanese residents outside the railway zone when the Japanese troops continue to withdraw and Chinese local officials and police are restored"; (3) Both governments "shall take all necessary steps to prevent the expansion of the scope of the incident or the further aggravation of the situation." Regarding these three points, the Committee is not yet able to submit a full report. Consideration of the assurance concerning "the expansion of the scope of the incident or the further aggravation of the situation" must be reserved for a later report. However, the Executive Yuan awaits an early report on the current situation regarding the assurances given by China and Japan in relation to the above sections (1) and (2). Therefore, the following report, Part Two, is submitted for your information.</p>
<p>Part Two</p>
<p>The Actual Situation in Dong Province: Information on the military situation in the three northeastern provinces has been provided by the Japanese military authorities, divided into five chapters. The first three chapters describe the Japanese troops and other troops cooperating with the Japanese troops, and the last two chapters describe the troops opposing the Japanese troops. Information on the fourth chapter was also obtained from the Chinese side. It should be noted that a new feature has been discovered in the submissions, which was not taken into account by the Executive Yuan during the progress of the case last September and is the objective of this investigation, namely, that the local administrative organization has been changed. The Public Security Maintenance Committee was initially established with Japanese assistance in the last few months of 1931. This committee was subsequently replaced by the regime established on March 9, 1932, calling itself the "Government of Manchuria." This explanation is necessary to clarify the Japanese military authorities' use of terms such as Manchurian troops.</p>
<p>Chapter 1 Japanese Regular Troops</p>
<p>According to the number of Japanese troops within the Manchurian Railway Zone on September 18: 10,590 people. In the first half of December: 4,000 people inside the South Manchurian Railway Zone and 8,900 people outside the South Manchurian Railway Zone, totaling 12,900 people. In the second half of April: 6,600 people inside the South Manchurian Railway Zone and 17,800 people outside the South Manchurian Railway Zone in Qiqihar, Taonan, Liaoyang Railway, Shenyang, Shanhaiguan Railway, Chinese Eastern Railway, east of Harbin-Shenyang, and the northern section of the Jilin-Dunhua Railway, totaling 22,400 people.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 The "Manchurian State" Army</p>
<p>(1) Those designated as the "Manchurian State" army by the Japanese military authorities, part of which, it is said, were Chinese regular troops stationed in Manchuria before September 19, which were subsequently reorganized, are part, and newly recruited soldiers. This army was established with the assistance of the Japanese military authorities. Many retired Japanese military officers or Japanese military officers still serving in the Japanese army have been hired as military advisors, and their number is increasing daily, with some having entered into year-long contracts. A certain officer of the Japanese General Staff has been appointed as an advisor to the Ministry of National Defense of the "Manchurian State Government" in Changchun. (2) This army is mostly stationed or operating in Shenyang, Changchun, Taonan, Qiqihar, Dunhua, and along the Chinese Eastern Railway Zone. This army previously fought on the eastern section of the railway with troops who did not recognize the political power of the Government of Manchuria. It is said that, as of the end of March, the total number was 85,000 people. Since the report on this army is not very detailed, its actual number is not yet known. (3) Local police: The number of these police is approximately 119,000 people, of which 60,000 are local security forces. It is claimed that most of these police forces existed before September 18 and continue to exist, having been reorganized with the assistance of Japanese officials. (4) Furthermore, regarding the Japanese army and the troops of the anti-Manchurian State army, General Zhang Xueliang informed the Inquiry Committee in Beijing that, at the time of the September 19 incident, his troops outside the customs, including non-combatants, numbered 60,000 in Liaoning, 80,000 in Jilin, and 50,000 in Heilongjiang, totaling 190,000 people. Among them, approximately 50,000 troops stationed in Liaoning were subsequently withdrawn into the customs, so 140,000 people remained outside the customs. According to the Japanese military authorities, the current number of troops outside the customs is 110,000 people, of which 80,000 have joined the Manchurian State army, and 30,000 are resisting the Japanese army and the Manchurian State army in Jilin. Approximately 20,000 people have joined the so-called volunteer army, and their situation is described by them as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Part of the old Chinese army that does not recognize the political power of the Manchurian government. One army in the northeast of Harbin has 30,000 people. "According to China's official declaration, it is organized by the Jilin Self-Defense Army commanded by General Li Du and the Chinese Eastern Railway Protection Army commanded by General Ding Chao."</p>
<p>(B) The Volunteer Army. One is in the western part of Liaoning Province, the so-called Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army, mostly south of Jinzhou, with approximately 15,000 to 20,000 people. Two is the so-called Northeast National Volunteer Army, mostly commanded by Wu Qing, mostly active around Shenyang. This unit has clashed with the Japanese army several times, and its current strength is unknown. Three is the Rehe Volunteer Army. This army has better discipline, commanded by Tang Yulin, with approximately 3,000 people, including the remnants of the cavalry of the First and Second Divisions of General Zhang Xueliang. It is reported to be active on the border between Rehe and Liaoning. Four are several small volunteer army units, part of which are fighting in the Shanhaiguan area and part of which are fighting between Dunhua and Tianbaoshan. They have joined forces there with the formal army that opposes the Manchurian State government. The informal army mentioned in paragraph four of the first section of this chapter is said to have approximately 40,000 people.</p>
<p>(5) Bandits. Bandits are not organized for political purposes, and their numbers have increased due to the chaotic situation. According to the Japanese report, they are scattered throughout Manchuria, especially in the southern part of the Chinese Eastern Railway. The Japanese estimate their total number to be 40,000 people. In addition, there are another 12,000 bandits north and east of Jilin City, who, it is said, are cooperating with the Chinese army stationed in the northeast of Harbin mentioned in (4) (A) above. These various forces often have armed conflicts, such as bandit looting and attempts by the Japanese army and the Manchurian State army to suppress bandits, as well as wars between various armies seeking to maintain the new regime and opposing the new regime. The result is the loss of life, the destruction of property, and a general sense of unease.</p>
<p>Chapter 3</p>
<p>The Inquiry Committee does not wish to criticize the above-mentioned facts and figures at this time. The Japanese authorities argue that they cannot withdraw their troops at present in order to avoid endangering the lives and property of Japanese residents outside the railway zone. They seem to believe that troop withdrawal must also depend on the progress of what they call the reorganization of the Manchurian State army. The Chinese government does not currently exercise administrative power in any part of Manchuria, and due to the recent development of events, the practical problem of fulfilling its responsibilities has not yet arisen. In its final report, the Committee will consider possible ways to restore peace and security, as well as just methods and reasonable ways to create overall goodwill. The Committee will travel to Changchun next week and then to other parts of Manchuria to continue its investigation (Central News Agency dispatch on the 4th).</p>

<h3>The Issue of Elected Members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan</h3>
<p>Or They Will Be Selected from Among the National Representatives</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the election of half of the members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan, some have advocated that the National Assembly should handle it together. After repeated discussions by the Central Political Committee, it was generally agreed that the National Assembly is a purely representative body of public opinion. If the election of elected members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan is added, it will be very difficult and close to a dual body of public opinion. In the future, there may be duplication and conflict in terms of powers. Currently, the opinions of the committees can be summarized into the following two points: (1) Although the National Assembly cannot be convened as scheduled, it must be strictly organized in the future to produce a genuine body of public opinion, and the election of elected members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan will be decided to be cancelled. (2) If the elected members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan must be produced, they will be selected from among the representatives of the National Assembly to participate in the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan. Approximately within the next ten days, one of these two points can be selected for implementation to determine a concrete plan. (4th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Important Foreign Telegrams</p>
<h3>Britain and the United States Have a Consistent Attitude on the Far East Issue</h3>
<p>Stimson's Purpose of Visiting Europe Achieved</p>
<p>Simon Refutes Rumors of Suppressing China and Aiding Japan</p>
<p>▲ National Society, Geneva, 3rd: Since U.S. Secretary of State Stimson came to Europe and met with British Foreign Secretary MacDonald, League of Nations dignitaries now expect that a more solid understanding can be reached between Britain and the United States on the Manchurian issue. According to previous reports, Stimson felt disappointed with Britain's attitude towards dealing with the Far East. Although Stimson subsequently denied this, according to the Associated Press, American diplomats were indeed quite frustrated by the policies of British Foreign Secretary Simon before. However, since MacDonald came to Geneva to meet with Stimson, Stimson has received quite encouraging assurances from MacDonald. It is said that MacDonald told Stimson that after the outbreak of the Manchurian crisis, Britain's attitude was slightly weak because he was ill. In the future, Britain's actions will be more closely harmonized with the United States. In addition, after Stimson spoke with representatives of the British autonomous territories, he also confirmed that the attitudes and interests of the autonomous territories in the Far East are very similar to those of the United States.</p>
<p>▲ National Society, Washington, 3rd: An Associated Press reporter said that the purpose of U.S. Secretary of State Stimson's trip to Europe was to seek the assistance of European countries in maintaining the Open Door Policy in China and to promote the success of the disarmament conference. It is now said from reliable sources that this purpose has been largely achieved. However, countries such as Britain, France, and Italy are simultaneously unwilling to take any action to avoid offending the Japanese army. Stimson also has a good impression of the determination of European countries to maintain the dignity of treaties in order to preserve China's independence.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 4th: Labour MP Coquet asked Foreign Secretary Simon in the House of Commons today, saying that the world is now widely rumored that the Foreign Secretary is using his influence to resist China in order to help the Japanese. Is this statement true? The Foreign Secretary turned pale and replied that this statement is purely fictitious. The Foreign Secretary then briefly described the situation of the Geneva Conference, and then described the Sino-Japanese armistice agreement, saying that I am currently waiting for the news of the signing of the Shanghai Agreement, and will report to the House of Commons after receiving it. The Foreign Secretary then said that the armistice agreement stipulates the establishment of a joint committee to monitor the implementation of the agreement, to observe the withdrawal of troops by both sides, and stipulates that the Japanese army occupying the area will transfer to the Chinese police force that entered the area, and the police force will take over as soon as the Japanese army withdraws. The joint committee has the right to urge attention in any aspect where the agreement is not fulfilled. As Mr. Hee Mong said, we hope that the committee's decisions will be unanimous, and the agreement stipulates that decisions can be made by a majority, and the chairman has the right to vote. According to the reply given by Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Eden in the House of Commons on May 2nd, he denied that the committee could make a decision on the withdrawal of Japanese troops by a majority. The Foreign Secretary's statement today has dispelled doubts.</p>
<h3>Moscow Rumors of Tense Russian-Japanese Relations</h3>
<p>Japanese Troops Concentrated in Jilin Province Near the Russian Border</p>
<p>Red Army Determined to Resist Any Aggression</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Moscow, 3rd: Startling rumors of tense Russian-Japanese relations have again been received here from Shenyang. According to reports, Japanese troops are currently concentrated in Jilin Province, which is adjacent to the Russian border from Boli to the Korean border. It is heard that Japanese troops are currently moving from Harbin and Dunhua to Jilin Province. Japanese military aircraft and Japanese troops protecting the Changchun-Jilin Railway have now been transferred to Zhaoh and Boli in Jilin Province. A telegram from Boli stated that the employees' clubs of the Chinese Eastern Railway held meetings on May Day and sent telegrams to the Russian government protesting Japan's provocative actions against Russia.</p>
<p>▲ National Society, Moscow, 4th: It is reported here that Boli, Chita, Haicanwi, and other areas in the Far East held grand celebrations on Labor Day. Thousands of people guaranteed to do their best to defend the Russian border. General Xiang Luqian (i.e. General Galen), commander of the Far Eastern Red Army, has received countless letters and telegrams, all promising to do their best to resist when enemy troops invade the border. Mr. Bai in Boli Bin said that the Red Army is prepared to be able to repel any attacks, and said that we know how to build a socialist economic organization and will not allow anyone to interfere with our great progress. It is also heard that the employees of the Chinese Eastern Railway in northern Manchuria also had enthusiastic celebrations on May Day.</p>
<h3>Disarmament Subcommittee Meeting</h3>
<p>Issue of Aircraft Restrictions</p>
<p>Heated Debate Between German and French Representatives</p>
<p>Soviet Russia Sends Memorandum to Disarmament Conference</p>
<p>Satirizing Japan's Destruction of Peace in the Far East</p>
<p>Failure to Give People a Guarantee of Abiding by Treaties</p>
<p>▲ National Society, Geneva, 3rd: Although the General Committee of the International Disarmament Conference is currently adjourned indefinitely, the subcommittees are still proceeding as usual, and the debates are extremely fierce. Within the Naval Committee, U.S. representative Shi Huangsheng argued strongly today that aircraft carriers should not be widely eliminated, saying that war experience has shown that aircraft carriers are very valuable in resisting submarine warfare. German representative Baron Rhinbard strongly opposed, insisting that aircraft carriers must be abolished to comply with the Treaty of Versailles. In addition, the newly formed Technical Subcommittee of the Aviation Committee has begun its work today. Its task is to define the basic issues concerning commercial and military aircraft. After the establishment meeting of the subcommittee, German representative Brandenburg submitted a document relating to Germany's proposed abolition of all air force motions. The German representative also proposed that when defining military aircraft, they can be divided into three categories, namely bombers, reconnaissance aircraft, and pursuit aircraft. Subsequently, German and French representatives engaged in a fierce verbal battle. The French representative strongly advocated that commercial aircraft should be treated equally with military aircraft, and proposed that both types be placed under the supervision of the League of Nations. The German representative claimed that France's proposal was due to the extraordinary progress of German commercial aircraft and the ineffectiveness of the Treaty of Versailles, and was an attempt to exploit the power of German commercial aircraft.</p>
<p>▲ National Society, Geneva, 4th: German Disarmament Representative Leader Na Qingni suddenly departed for Berlin today after a long conversation with German Chancellor Bai Luning on the phone. According to the delegation, he was recalled to the country to discuss the current situation in Geneva.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Geneva, 3rd: Russia today submitted an important memorandum to the Disarmament Conference, linking the current Far Eastern dispute with the world's disarmament issue, saying that neighbors who destroy international obligations aimed at safeguarding peace and those who wage war without declaration have failed to give people sufficient guarantee of abiding by disarmament conventions.</p>
<h3>French Second Round of Voting, Left-Wing Parties Agree to Cooperate</h3>
<p>To Engage the Government Party Head-on</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Paris, 3rd: Helriot's Social Radical Party has decided to challenge the Tae Tieu government in the second round of voting on Sunday. Therefore, in each electoral district, if the Socialist Party has a greater hope of being elected, the candidates of the Social Radical Party will not join the war to avoid dividing the votes of the Socialist Party, so that the Socialist Party can engage the government party head-on and seize the parliamentary seats of Tae Tieu. Of the 615 seats in the House of Representatives, only 261 have been elected. The right-wing party supporting Tae Tieu occupies 131 seats, the opposition party occupies 120 seats, and the remaining seats have yet to be elected in the second round of voting.</p>
<p>▲ Havas, London, 3rd: The London Daily Electric News Report commented on the French election, saying that even if the rulers of France change, France's foreign policy may not change course.</p>
<p>▲ Havas, Berlin, 3rd: German newspapers have made many comments on the French election. The Stock Exchange News said that the opposition forces formed by the Socialist Party and the Radical Socialist Party have increased compared to before, but said that it is still not possible to say that they can catch up with the superior position of the majority parties of Tae Tieu. The Volkszeitung said that if the left-wing parties want to make the Tae Tieu government fail, they must win at least 60 more seats than before. The Local People's Voice said that those who sympathize with the left-wing alliance are inevitably rejoicing too early, because even if the left-wing parties win as they expect, they cannot organize a cabinet.</p>
<h3>Former German Foreign Minister to Visit Russia to Investigate Economic and Political Situation</h3>
<p>▲ National Society, Berlin, 3rd: Former German Foreign Minister Coutis will go to Soviet Russia in the near future to conduct a large-scale investigation to investigate the economic and political situation in the Soviet Union. However, it is said that this move has no political nature. Mr. Kou is going to investigate as the president of the Eastern European National Research Association.</p>
<h3>Ancient Red Indian Chieftain's Remains Discovered in Northern America</h3>
<p>▲ Reuters, Washington, 3rd: The remains of an ancient Red Indian chieftain and burial artifacts have recently been discovered on Kodiak Island in northern America. After research by the famous anthropologist Dr. Hertley, it is believed that it is sufficient to recognize that the American Indians originated in the Asian continent, crossed the Bering Strait to the west, and reached the coast of Alaska. Over time, they gradually migrated south and multiplied on the North and South American continents. It is also said that although the three major cultures of the Aster, Indian, and Mies in America were eliminated by white people, examining their relics seems to be transmitted from Asia. Dr. Hertley has two reasons for this view: (1) The remains found on the island are fragmented and incomplete. It has been found that the tribesmen admired their life and ate their flesh in groups on the verge of death, and struck their bones to suck their marrow, hoping to obtain the virtues of the dead. South American Indians once had this custom, so Dr. Hertley said that the ethnic group may be descendants of this chieftain; (2) Both the chieftain's skull eye sockets contained iron ivory, and precious stones were placed in the eyeballs. The Asters and Meiers of America also often did this to the dead. Many ancient attachments have also been excavated on Kodiak Island, the dating of which is difficult to verify, but it seems undoubtedly the oldest relics of mankind in America. Therefore, scientists said that when the distant ancestors of the Indians first migrated to the Americas, they should have taken Kodiak Island as the first stop.</p>

<h3>Public Telegrams</h3>
<p>⊙Telegram from Batavia: To be forwarded by Shenbao to the Gentlemen of the National Government. Jiang and Cai have resigned, public sentiment is outraged, the signing of the humiliating treaty, overseas Chinese cannot accept it. Respectfully from the overseas Chinese of Batavia.</p>
<p>⊙Telegram from Nanchang: To Shenbao: Your newspaper published on April 27th, a special telegram from Hong Kong dated the 26th, which excerpted, "This army sent a telegram to the Fujian authorities, stating that they were ordered by Feng to go to Longyan, passing through Zhangzhou and Xiamen, to Shanghai to resist Japan, Commander-in-Chief of the National Salvation Volunteer Army, Sun Lianzhong," etc. This army is currently stationed in the Linyi area of Jiangxi Province, suppressing bandits, and has no plans to enter Fujian to resist Japan, nor has it changed its name. However, according to reports from officers who escaped from the bandit side, Huang Zongyue, a former brigade commander of this route who rebelled last season, disturbed the Fujian territory in early April. Perhaps this is the reason for the misunderstanding. We fear that after long-term dissemination, the facts will be confused. Therefore, we specifically send this telegram to clarify the details, hoping for correction to reveal the truth. Respectfully, Sun Lianzhong, Commander-in-Chief of the 26th Route Army.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Dissatisfaction of Various National Representatives with the Investigation Committee</h3>
<p>▲Due to the Committee's Dealing with a Puppet State</p>
<p>Nagasaki Nichi-Nichi Shimbun reports that representatives from various countries in Geneva are gradually moving from the Shanghai issue to deliberate on the Manchurian issue. Currently, they are expressing considerable dissatisfaction with the actions of the Lytton Commission. Because the League of Nations has not recognized Manchuria, the Investigation Committee is dealing with Manchuria as an interlocutor, frequently negotiating, which is a completely free action that goes beyond the scope of the League of Nations' intentions. Originally, the actions of the Investigation Committee were different from general activities. Now, they have not taken active actions for the purpose of their dispatch, greatly losing the true meaning of the investigation. Representatives from seven or eight countries, such as Norway, Spain, and Czechoslovakia, have launched fierce attacks, it is said.</p>
<h3>All Powers of the Puppet State Are in the Hands of the Japanese</h3>
<p>Osaka Asahi Shimbun reports that important senior officials in the government of Manchuria have recently been successively replaced by Japanese. On April 26th and 27th, the State Council announced the following: (1) Appointed Pu Menkejie as Director of the Accounting Department of the General Affairs Office; (2) Kuma Moto Noboru as Director of the Needs Department; (3) Abiru Kanji as Director of the General Affairs Division of the Ministry of Justice; (4) Kuriyama Shigeji as Director of the Legal Affairs Division; (9) Matsuki Kyo as Director of the Legislation Bureau; (6) Nakano Kohitsu as Director of the General Affairs Division of the Ministry of Civil Affairs; (7) Genda Matsuzo as Director of the General Affairs Division of the Ministry of Finance; (8) Morita Narishige as Director of the Railway Division; (9) Ueno Takashi as Secretary-General of the General Affairs Office; (10) Takano Tadao as Director of the Personnel Office.</p>
<h3>Japanese Newspaper Discusses Russia's Plan to Disrupt All of Manchuria</h3>
<p>▲Plan to Bomb All Japanese Cities</p>
<p>Nagoya Shimbun's Harbin dispatch states that after the Japanese army expanded into North Manchuria, Russia's situation suddenly changed. The North Manchurian Committee of the Russian Communist Party, with 250 determined combat volunteer leaders, appointed 20 employees of the Chinese Eastern Railway (CER) to secretly plot to destroy the first Songhua River Railway Bridge on the southern line of the CER on March 29th. On the other hand, on March 2nd, the Russian government ordered the Russian Consul-General in Harbin and the Deputy Director of the CER to withdraw all commercial trade from the area. Meanwhile, the Soviet Russian Combat Volunteer Army, believing that the Japanese army was invading Russian territory, conspired to blow up all institutions and throw North Manchuria into great chaos. They all eagerly tried to implement Lenin's legacy. In particular, the Red Air Force, with its strong morale, encouraged comrades to completely bomb all cities in Japan. Using detailed military maps of Manchuria, Mongolia, and Korea, they attempted to disrupt all of Manchuria. Currently, 80 criminals have been arrested, and a large number of evidence has been seized. It is reported that since January 1st, 2,978 Soviet Russian communists have been active in North Manchuria, extremely resentful of the Japanese army's actions, and the unstable situation is becoming increasingly critical.</p>
<h3>Itoda Division of the Japanese Army Arrives in Harbin</h3>
<p>▲One of the Three Divisions Being Reinforced</p>
<p>▲The Purpose is to Attack the National Salvation Army on the Harbin-Suifenhe Line</p>
<p>▲Residents in the Zhuhe Area Completely Evacuated</p>
<p>▲Soviet Russia Disrupts North Manchurian Transportation to Restrain Japan</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: After the Hirose 10th Division of the Japanese Army arrived here, the Itoda Division stationed in Korea continued to arrive on April 26th and will move towards the area between Yimianpo and Shitoukhezi on the Harbin-Suifenhe section of the Eastern Railway. This is one of the three divisions that the Japanese cabinet decided to reinforce in North Manchuria. The arrival date of the remaining two divisions is yet to be determined. In the future, the military center of gravity will be in Harbin. The Japanese military plan is to first disperse the self-defense army of Li Du and Ding Chao and the National Salvation Army of Wang Delin, and then devote all efforts to dealing with Soviet Russia. Therefore, their military actions are becoming increasingly active. The Murai Brigade stationed in Yimianpo has been advancing eastward since the 25th, using a cavalry battalion to protect armored vehicles, repairing the demolished tracks along the way. By the 27th, it had advanced to Hailin Station. The right to operate the section from Yimianpo to Shitoukhezi has been transferred by the Japanese army to more than 100 Manchurian Railway employees, who are jointly managing it with White Russians, and everything is under the control of the Japanese army, completely breaking away from the control of the Eastern Railway Administration and completely turning the guests into the hosts. When the Japanese army advanced, the National Salvation Army in the Shitoukhezi and Hengdaohezi area did not resist but retreated step by step, abandoning the defense of the railway line, and divided into two branches to bypass the Japanese army. On the morning of the 26th, they crossed Yimianpo and attacked Zhuhe, surrounding two battalions of the Japanese army and launching a fierce attack. The Xi Qia troops stationed locally were notified in advance by the National Salvation Army and retreated to Ashihe. Therefore, the Japanese army was trapped in a heavy encirclement, and more than 300 of the two battalions of over 1,000 men were killed. Later, a regiment of the Japanese army from Yimianpo arrived to provide assistance, and the siege was lifted. However, Zhuhe County and the Ujim River Station of the Eastern Railway were destroyed by artillery fire, and the buildings in the two places were turned into scorched earth. Although the National Salvation Army has retreated, it is not far away. The residents in the Zhuhe area were notified by the National Salvation Army to evacuate completely within a week or so. The Eastern Railway provided special assistance and allowed free transportation of refugees to Harbin. By the 27th, 1,004 refugees had arrived in Harbin. Fearing that the National Salvation Army would cut off their retreat, the Japanese army sent two regiments of Itoda's infantry to Ujim to prepare for defense. Due to the disrupted transportation, passenger and freight trains traveling eastward still only run to Yimianpo. Telecommunications only reach Ujim.</p>
<p>The Japanese military department in Harbin arrested a large number of Red Russians, accusing them all of plotting to disrupt transportation. On the 26th, Yagi, the Japanese advisor to the Special Police Department, announced the Soviet Russian organization of a transportation disruption squad in North Manchuria, with 20 people in each squad, specializing in destroying transportation lines along the Eastern Railway and all related buildings, totaling 20 squads. The leaders are all important employees of the Eastern Railway. The focus of sabotage is the Harbin-Changchun line and the Harbin-Suifenhe line. It is also said that this action is directed by the Soviet Russian Far East Special Military District Command. Although this was released by the Japanese side, the actual situation does seem to be the case. At noon on the 27th, a Japanese plane flew east of Yimianpo for reconnaissance and went missing. The Japanese side believes that this was caused by a Soviet Russian guerrilla attack, resulting in the plane crashing. Currently, the Japanese side has removed its false facade towards Russia and entered into arguments, and a firefight may not be far off.</p>
<p>The Japanese army, totaling 6,000 men, departed from Harbin to Yilan to attack Li Du and Ding Chao. They were traveling on ten ships including the Nanxiang, Sanshui, Yanghu, Mingshan, Fuzhou, Shuangcheng, Faku, Liaoyang, Yizhou, and Hangzhou, along with 25 towed barges and 100 sailboats. The sailboats mostly carried grain and grass, covered with canvas. Some say that the figures tied on the ships are straw men, seemingly wanting to use the story of Cao Cao borrowing arrows with straw boats as a clever tactic to attack Yilan. The three Jiangfang warships of the Northeastern Navy, Lishui, Liji, and Jiangqing, and three motorboats have also been dispatched. Each warship is transporting over 100 Japanese soldiers and several artillery pieces. Sailors on the ships were unwilling to be used by the enemy, and some escaped in advance. Those who were discovered by the Japanese were monitored by soldiers, and they were not separated even during meals. However, when sailing near Laoshantou and Wuhe, many took advantage of the night to jump into the river and swim away. The Japanese then stopped the ship mid-way, returned to Harbin, and sought hundreds of White Russians to supplement the crew. On the 27th, the motorboats carrying Japanese soldiers arrived at Laoshantou east of Harbin and were ambushed by the righteous army from the mountains. One boat was destroyed, and 40 soldiers were drowned. Therefore, the Japanese ships are proceeding with great caution. For example, the first batch that departed on the evening of the 27th, when arriving at Tonghe, because downstream is the Jiangbei shore of Tangyuan, a strategic pass, where more than 1,000 of Ma Zhanshan's troops are stationed, defending the area. The Japanese soldiers did not dare to rush in and could only advance slowly. (April 28th)</p>
<p>Northeastern Regions</p>
<h3>Current Situation of the Volunteer Army</h3>
<p>— Ke</p>
<p>Special Correspondence from Beiping</p>
<p>Recently, many volunteer armies in various parts of Northeast China have been eliminated, and many have also sprung up. For example, the troops of Jin Dexuan and Shi Anquan were utterly defeated in the SuiZhong campaign. Of the more than 20 commanders appointed by the Northeast People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, only one or two tenths are now able to command their troops. However, upon closer examination, the members of each group are still alive and well, mostly establishing their own banners and seeking other paths. In addition to the formal troops of Ding Chao, Li Du, Ma Zhanshan, Su Bingwen, and Yuan Chonggu, the anti-Japanese forces in the Northeast are becoming more deeply entrenched. Recently, the burning of grain and fodder factories near Shenyang, the cutting of telegraph lines, the Xiaobailong and Gaitianhong in northwestern Tongliao, leading more than 8,000 people, are about to move, constantly destroying transportation. The occupation of various institutions in Tonghua by the volunteer army, and various other activities are too numerous to mention, making the Japanese army exhausted and unable to defend against everything. The current situation of the volunteer army in various places, which has been recently and accurately investigated, is listed in the following table:</p>
<p>A List of the Leaders, Troops, Weapons, Defense Areas, and Current Status of the Volunteer Army in Various Parts of Northeast China</p>
<p>Leader's Name Troops Weapons Remarks</p>
<p>Zheng Guilin 1,000 Complete Cavalry</p>

<p>Liu Haiquan 1,300 1,000 Cavalry</p>
<p>Feng Zijing 2,000 1,000 Cavalry</p>
<p>Guo Qiang 4,000 2,100 Infantry</p>
<p>Zhao Minggu, Wang Haiting 3,000 2,800 Infantry</p>
<p>The above all belong to Northern Liaoning</p>

<p>Li Huanzhang, Yin Yuanmin 2,000 600 Infantry</p>
<p>Liu Kejian 2,000 2,000 Both cavalry and infantry</p>
<p>Deng Tiemei 3,000 2,500 Infantry</p>
<p>The above all belong to Eastern Liaoning</p>

<p>The above belongs to Southern Liaoning</p>
<p>Li Haiqing 20,000 20,000 Both cavalry and infantry</p>
<p>Wang Delin 30,000 20,000 Both cavalry and infantry</p>
<p>Li Pizu 5,000 5,000 Both cavalry and infantry (No news for a long time, current status unknown)</p>
<p>The above all belong to Jilin</p>
<p>Zeng Xianyu 7,000 6,800 Both cavalry and infantry (Including 2,000 members of the Republic)</p>
<p>Peng Jiemin 1,500 1,400 Infantry (Militia)</p>
<p>Jiang Yunzhang 700 700 Infantry (Militia)</p>
<p>The above all belong to Heilongjiang Province</p>
<p>Of the troops listed in the table above, the troops of Yu Baien in western Liaoning have the best discipline and are in harmony with the local people. The troops of Wang Delin and Li Haiqing in Jilin have great influence, and the defense area of these troops is near Vladivostok, which is very convenient for transportation and has excellent defensive capabilities. The members of the other troops are also very sound, and their average strength is comparable. If efforts are made to reorganize them and unite them to resist Japan, it will not be very difficult to recover the lost territories of Northeast China.</p>

<h3>Shandong Plans to Reform the Military System</h3>
<p>▲Will Increase One Division</p>
<p>A person from Jinan said that Jiang Zhongzheng, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, believes that the current military system in our country has four types of divisions: A, B, C, and D, with inconsistent numbers of personnel. Therefore, he plans to adopt economic measures to unify the system, using the division as a unit, with two brigades per division and two regiments per brigade. This method is expected to be implemented soon. Currently, Han Fuqu, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government and Commander-in-Chief of the Third Route Army, has five divisions under his command. The 20th Division Commander Sun Tongxuan and the 29th Division Commander Cao Fulin are both Class A divisions, with three brigades each. The 22nd Division Commander Gu Liangmin, the 74th Division Commander Qiao Lizhi, and the 81st Division Commander Zhan Shutang are all Class B divisions, with two brigades each. If reorganized according to the new military system, Gu Liangmin, Qiao Lizhi, and Zhan Shutang are already suitable and will not be changed. However, Sun Tongxuan and Cao Fulin each have one extra brigade. These two extra brigades are just enough to form a new division. Therefore, it will be used to increase one division, without increasing the number of personnel or military pay. It is expected that the central government will also approve it. Recently, Han Fuqu convened important generals to Jinan to discuss the methods for the academic and military subjects examinations of each division and brigade in the summer. The implementation of the new military system was also studied. It is said that the most promising candidates for the commander of the newly added division are Li Hanzhang, the 85th Brigade Commander of the 29th Division stationed in Dezhou, and Rong Guangxing, the 87th Brigade Commander of the 29th Division stationed in Jiaozhou. One will be selected and recommended in the future. After the meeting, the division and brigade commanders have returned to their original defenses on the 30th.</p>
<h3>The Process of Wang Jialie's Leadership in Guizhou</h3>
<p>▲The Rise and Fall of Wang and Mao's Forces</p>
<p>Guiyang dispatch: The Chairman of the Guizhou Provincial Government has been officially changed to Wang Jialie by the National Government. Among them, Mao's resignation and Wang's succession, on the surface, is based on the recommendation of the former Guizhou Provincial Government Chairman Mao Guangxiang by telegram. Mao's concession has an earlier process. When Zhou Xicheng commanded the Guizhou army, Mao and Wang were both division commanders under Zhou. In terms of ability, Wang was better than Mao, but in terms of personal relations, Zhou was closer to Mao, because Mao was Zhou's brother-in-law. Mao was favored by Zhou, and his power was particularly strong and his support was also broad. Therefore, Mao succeeded as chairman after Zhou's death, and Wang was frustrated, so he led his troops into Hunan and left the province. However, his ambition to return to the province and participate in politics has never been abandoned. When he was in Hunan, he spared no effort in reorganizing the army. Because transportation in Hunan Province is more convenient than in Guizhou, and the replenishment of military supplies is also easier. Mao could not feel at ease, believing that Wang would inevitably return sooner or later. Therefore, he discussed with his subordinates and invited Wang to return to the province to avoid complications. Wang then personally led four regiments to return, but stopped near the provincial capital without advancing. Mao's initial intention was to allow himself to serve as the chairman, commander-in-chief, and training division commander, and to let Wang be the chairman, responsible for civil affairs, while the positions of commander-in-chief and training division commander would still be held by Mao. Therefore, the telegram recommending Wang as chairman was issued immediately. However, at this time, Wang had not yet entered the province, believing that the implementation of civil power in the province still had to be assisted by military force. At this time, due to disputes in opinion, the people in the provincial capital were quite shaken, fearing that it would cause a war. Fortunately, other middle-ground military officers, such as You Guocai, Che Mingyi, and Huang Yanbin, strongly advised Mao to give up everything. Mao, seeing that the general trend was irreversible, gave up both military and civil power. Currently, Mao still lives in the provincial capital, with only a pistol battalion left to protect him. Therefore, although he lives in the same city as Wang, they can coexist peacefully.</p>
<h3>Long Xiang, Clerk of the Hankou Municipal Party Headquarters, Executed for Banditry</h3>
<p>▲The Wuhan Garrison Headquarters Investigated and Carried Out the Execution by Firing Squad</p>
<p>Hankou dispatch: Long Xiang, a clerk of the Hankou Municipal Party Headquarters, was arrested on March 5th for a banditry case. The Municipal Party Headquarters listed various doubts and sent a letter to the Garrison Headquarters requesting careful handling, saying that Long was from a prominent family in Xiangyang and worked diligently, fearing that there would be injustice. The Garrison Headquarters also listed evidence confirming Long as the principal offender. The case was extremely concerned by the society. Recently, the Garrison Headquarters concluded its interrogation and sentenced Long Xiang to death. He was executed by firing squad in Wuchang on the 3rd. In addition to announcing the crimes, the Garrison Headquarters also issued an order to its subordinates, strictly prohibiting attacks by word of mouth. The proclamation stated: "The case investigation found that on March 4th, the postal and telecommunications inspection office presented three threatening letters from anonymous bandits to Zhou Zhongxuan's home at No. 6 Tianfu Lane in the French Concession, and attached two returned savings passbooks and several disaster relief receipts. The investigation office was immediately dispatched to investigate and arrest the suspects. On the morning of March 5th, according to Zhou's report, the office arrested Liu Shutang, a tea house worker at the Huihua Hotel, who was tricked by bandits into delivering a letter to Zhou's house to extort money. Then, based on the identification of Cai Linxing, another tea house worker at the hotel, the bandit Zhou Zhuxuan, also known as Long Xiang, who personally wrote the above letters in room 34, was arrested. Two official draft letters, a lieutenant quartermaster Long Xiang's symbol, were found in his pocket, and a list written by the bandit and a broken letter were submitted by the hotel. According to Zhou Zhuxuan's confession, a suspect named Yang Yixin was arrested and sent to the department for handling according to the law. The case was immediately handed over to the military law office for trial according to the law, and the progress of the case was reported separately. Subsequently, the Central Executive Committee sent a telegram instructing that Long Xiang's case of fraud and extortion should be handled according to the law. After repeated court hearings, except for Liu Shutang and Yang Yixin, whose criminal suspicion was insufficient and needed further investigation, as for Zhou Zhuxuan, also known as Long Xiang, Cai Linxing, a tea house worker at the Huihua Hotel, testified in court that he was the one who opened the room, closed the door to write the letter, and asked someone to deliver it. After repeated questioning, it remained consistent. The letters of intimidation to Zhou Zhongxuan and the list submitted by the hotel, as well as the drafts personally written by Zhou Zhuxuan found in his pocket, and other letters, were sent to the Hubei Higher Court Prosecutor's Office and various legal groups to appoint responsible representatives for detailed identification. It was determined that the handwriting was the same. According to this testimony, the suspect was indeed a bandit who robbed Zhou Zhongxuan's family property and continued to send letters to intimidate him. The crime was serious. According to the provisions of Articles 1 and 29 of the Provisional Regulations for the Punishment of Bandits, he was sentenced to death, and his civil rights were deprived for life according to Article 57 of the Criminal Law. The instructions from the E Suijing Public Office [Law] No. 208 stated that the presentation and judgment, as well as the entire case file, were all understood. Zhou Zhuxuan, also known as Long Xiang, etc., dared to collude to rob and then extort money, which was extremely illegal. Since human and material evidence has been collected and the investigation is clear, according to the provisions of Articles 1 and 29 of the Provisional Regulations for the Punishment of Bandits, he is sentenced to death, and his civil rights are deprived for life according to Article 57 of the Criminal Law. There is nothing wrong with it. Permission is granted to execute according to the judgment, and the original file will be returned, and the date of execution should be reported for filing. The rest of the bandits should be arrested and investigated. This order," the proclamation stated, "Zhou Zhuxuan, also known as Long Xiang, 30 years old, from Hunan." (May 3rd)</p>
<h3>Disaster Victims from Northern Anhui Flock to Bengbu</h3>
<p>▲Local Facilities Provide Two Congee Kitchens</p>
<p>▲Over 7,000 People Eat Every Day</p>
<p>Bengbu dispatch: The Huaihe and Sihe areas in northern Anhui have been plagued by bandits for years, and the people's livelihoods are deteriorating. Last summer, they suffered a terrible flood, with wailing everywhere. Coupled with the rampant bandits, robbing and looting, the survivors were unable to make a living. The strong and cunning turned to crime, joining the bandit gangs to make a living by robbery. Women, children, and the elderly could not maintain their lives and fled the disaster areas, begging for food everywhere, hoping to survive. Unexpectedly, since the spring, northern Anhui has suffered another drought, and the seedlings have failed to sprout. Even in high-lying areas where the flood receded earlier, wheat farmers must wait until June to harvest, and rice farmers will not harvest until September or October. During these months when the old and new crops are not yet available, the spring famine is severe, and starvation is intensifying. Refugees are everywhere, which is heartbreaking to witness. Most of the disaster victims in the Huaihe and Sihe areas believe that Bengbu is a convenient location for transportation north and south and by water and land, and it is easier to beg for food. Therefore, they flocked to Bengbu, turning the good city of Bengbu into a place for the disaster victims of northern Anhui to gather. The streets and alleys are full of orphans who are haggard and distressed, supporting the old and carrying the young, begging from door to door, exposed to the wind and dew, which is extremely miserable. Even starved corpses are seen everywhere. According to statistics, there are no less than 10,000 disaster victims. In the past, the local authorities in charge of disaster relief have implemented relief work, but only for the relatively poor households in the city, paying little attention to the homeless refugees begging from door to door because they have no fixed place to go and cannot be tracked. Now, philanthropists Lu Chewu, Peng Zhuoru, Zhu Zhonghua, Li Mutan, Ding Jiuqing, and Huang Gongchen, etc., have donated money to purchase grain and establish congee kitchens, two in total, one in Wangyingzi behind the east railway station and one in Sanjing Street in the west amusement field. Congee tickets are issued in advance, and the time for distributing congee is from 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. every day. Each person receives a bowl of rice congee every day, which is just enough to survive. Congee tickets are changed every day, and newcomers can apply for them. In recent days, the east kitchen has cooked eight pots of congee every day, with more than 3,800 people eating, and the west kitchen has cooked six pots of congee every day, with more than 3,200 people eating. According to statistics, more than 7,000 refugees go to the two congee kitchens every day to eat. We hope that philanthropists will quickly raise funds for fundamental relief measures. (May 1st)</p>
<h3>Local News</h3>
<p>▲ Xu Yabo's Appeal to Jiangsu: Xu Yabo, former district chief of the Water Police, along with the ringleaders Taibao Ashu and Li Wenjun, who had already been executed for conspiring in Shanghai, were major criminals involved in disturbing various coastal counties in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Xu Pucheng, the first district chief of the Water Police, personally apprehended them in Shanghai, in conjunction with the concession police. Apart from Li Wenjun and others, who were directly escorted to the Zhenjiang Security Office for interrogation and execution, Xu Yabo's name came up because among the stolen goods in the Chenjiahang Qian Boming robbery case in this county, there was a bank deposit book. Xu Yabo had sent someone to the bank to collect the money, but it was confiscated. Qian Boming, the victim, discovered the whereabouts of the stolen goods and filed a lawsuit in court. The case was transferred to the Shanghai Special District Court, and Xu was brought to Songjiang for trial. After several investigations, Li Hui, (also known as Li Wenjun's mistress), was summoned and testified that Taibao Ashu was introduced by Xu Huoquan to become Xu Yabo's disciple. The robbery of Qian Boming's home in Chenjiahang was initiated by Li Wenjun, who informed Xu Yabo at the Changchang Inn, stating that the stolen goods would be used to rescue his disciple Tang Yixin. However, Xu Yabo insisted that the teacher Taibao Ashu had拜, was a mistaken 徐亚伯 (another similar name), and stated that he did not know who had put the deposit book in the mailbox, and it was picked up by a servant. Lawyers Yuan and Liu were present and witnessed this. After repeated defenses, and with legal defenses provided by lawyers Xu Heling, Wang Zengxi, and Lu Longxiang, the county court sentenced Xu Yabo to seven years in prison for robbery on January 23rd of this year. Xu declared his dissatisfaction in court and was detained in the detention center. Now, the appeal hearing has been scheduled, and the court specially dispatched bailiffs yesterday (the 3rd) at 3 pm to escort Xu to Jiangsu for the hearing.</p>
<p>▲ Water Police Recover Kidnapped Victims: After two farmers, Gao Liansheng and Gao Lianfa, from the Qianyue Town of Jiashan under the jurisdiction of the Jiaxing Water Police Second District, were kidnapped in late March, the district strictly ordered its subordinates to investigate the case and rescue the hostages. Now, the bandits in the case sent a letter to the hostage's family to negotiate the ransom in Shanghai. Police detectives successively arrested Yan Baoshu, Lu Aqing, Hang A'er, Pan Tingfang, Wang Lianfu, Wang Jisheng, and women Yan Lu and Hang Zhou, a total of eight people, and escorted them to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Upon learning of this, the Water Police District immediately went to Shanghai to bring the eight bandits back to Jiaxing for interrogation. They have now confessed to the location where the hostages were held. The police immediately escorted the criminals to Zhang A'da's house in Yunjucun Zhangjiaqiao, Xinqi, and rescued the two hostages, Gao Liansheng and Gao Lianfa. They also arrested the bandits Li Maolin and Wang A'san, who were guarding the hostages. The case will now be transferred by the district to the court for further investigation.</p>
<p>▲ Starving People Block River Workers' Relief Wheat: A dispatch from Nantong states that the Jiangchuan River in the Jinghua District of Nantong was decided to be dredged by the Water Conservancy Conference, using labor as a form of relief. On the 3rd, a large quantity of relief wheat was transported from the city. However, when the wheat boats arrived at Tangfangtou, they were suddenly blocked and looted by five or six hundred starving men and women. They also resisted and injured Cai Xianglin, the head of the defense corps. Upon receiving the report, the county government immediately dispatched the county police team to suppress the situation.</p>
<p>▲ Zhang Jian's Property Sold to Aid Relief: A dispatch from Nantong states that Zhang Jian's property, after being returned by the provincial government, is now being voluntarily allocated by Zhang to the Jiangbei disaster area as funds for dredging rivers and repairing dikes.

<p>▲ Headquarters Executes Key Criminal: A letter from Qingjiang states that Zhou Xiangting from Dongtusheng, Funing County, once served as a member of the Jiangsu Provincial Assembly during the warlord era. In 1929, he was appointed as a fake brigade commander by Ma Yuren, gathering a thousand bandits and occupying the Caiqiao area of the county, committing adultery, looting, and all kinds of atrocities. In January 1930, he led bandits to rob the Huacheng Salt Reclamation Company. In July of the same year, he held up the manager and more than ten other employees of Huacheng, extorting 60,000 yuan in foreign currency. The Funing County Government reported the case to the Provincial Government, which resolved to issue an arrest warrant at the 265th meeting. Last winter, the criminal secretly came to Huaiyin to engage in subversive activities and was caught by the 25th Route Army Headquarters. After the headquarters summoned the victims to conduct questioning, it was confirmed that he was a major bandit in the Yancheng and Funing counties of Jiangbei. He was sentenced to death and executed by shooting at the Qingyang Small Railway Station today after the headquarters verified his identity.</p>
<p>▲ Arrests Made for Eating Sparrow Rice: Liu Yongkui, the leader of the 4th squad stationed in Xiyan Village under the 2nd squad of the Rugao County Police, received a report on the 28th from Sun Zhanshu, a resident of Huangbaihu, stating that several people were causing trouble at his home.

<h3>Case of Japanese Soldiers Crossing a Bridge and Stabbing Seven Chinese</h3>
<p>▲The Municipal Council Bears Responsibility</p>
<p>▲The Municipal Government Seriously Negotiates</p>
<p>▲The Chinese Ratepayers' Association Offers a Solemn Admonition</p>
<p>▲American Officials Hope for a Swift Resolution</p>
<p>At half past six in the afternoon the day before yesterday, Japanese soldiers near the Wuzhen Road Bridge stabbed seven Chinese people, creating an extremely serious situation for a time. Later, officers dispatched by the concession police went to suppress the incident, and two American soldiers assisted in dissuading the perpetrators. The Japanese soldiers who committed the assault then retreated to Zhabei. This case is of great importance and has garnered much attention from all sectors. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲Protest from the Municipal Government: Yesterday, the Shanghai Municipal Government sent a letter to the Municipal Council, stating: "To the Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council: On the afternoon of the 3rd of this month, near the Wuzhen Road Bridge on Xin Zha Road, Japanese soldiers crossed into the concession, chased pedestrians, and reached Park Road, stabbing seven Chinese people. This case has already been reported to your council by the responsible police station. As the incident location is within the concession, your council is responsible for ensuring the safety of Chinese residents within the special zone. However, your council was neither able to prevent nor stop the violent behavior of the Japanese soldiers within the concession, causing our people to suffer greatly. We express our deep regret. We hereby send this letter to request that you investigate, conduct serious negotiations, and instruct your subordinates to make every effort to protect Chinese residents within the concession, so that similar incidents do not occur again. We hope for a prompt response to maintain our public friendship. Sincerely, Yu Hongjun, Secretary-General."</p>
<p>▲Admonition from the Chinese Ratepayers' Association: The Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession, concerned about the repeated incidents caused by Japanese soldiers in the concession in recent days, causing residents to feel insecure, sent another letter to the Municipal Council yesterday, requesting that effective measures be taken quickly to restore normalcy as soon as possible. The original letter stated: "To the Secretary-General: On the 3rd of this month, our association requested your council to quickly investigate and rescue the twenty-five employees of the Nanyang Printing Company at 322-323 Tiantong Road who were kidnapped by Japanese soldiers and whose whereabouts are unknown, and to adopt the most effective measures to restore normalcy as soon as possible. On the same day, we also received a letter from Yu Hede, Chairman of the Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai, regarding the same matter. Unexpectedly, today's newspaper reported that on the afternoon of the 3rd, Japanese soldiers again used bayonets to stab pedestrians on Xin Zha Road, and attacked an old woman in the Li Hengxing Yuanyuan Shop near Jiangyuan Lane for no reason. They also provoked trouble at the Xiangtai Clothing Store nearby. When they failed, they turned to Wang Fengtai Foreign Goods Store and used knives to smash glass cabinets and counters. We were shocked and dismayed upon reading this. For a month, your council has been striving to restore normalcy, and based on this desire, you even listened to one-sided reports and issued a statement through your council's intelligence office, tolerating and exhorting the Chinese. However, the Japanese soldiers' violent acts in the concession in recent days show that your council no longer has the authority to maintain order in your mind. It is clear that they will use such violent means to achieve some purpose. If this continues, it will inevitably cause the residents of the concession to have an intolerable mentality, suspecting your council's ability to prevent disturbances and restore normalcy. The impact of this is immeasurable. Our association hereby solemnly admonishes you to pay attention to the seriousness of this situation, quickly adopt effective measures of restraint, and fulfill the so-called fair treatment obligations of a fair agency, to ensure that similar incidents do not occur again, so that residents can live and work in peace. We eagerly await your prompt reply regarding the handling of this matter."</p>
<p>▲Report from the North-China Daily News: The North-China Daily News reported: "Yesterday evening (the 3rd) at 6:30 PM, approximately sixty or seventy Japanese marines left their defense posts and crossed the Wuzhen Road Bridge, entering the Xin Zha area. It is said that their purpose was to punish several Chinese who threw stones at Japanese sentries across the Suzhou Creek in the afternoon. Although this matter was temporarily resolved peacefully on the spot, negotiations are expected to follow. It is reported that at least ten Chinese were injured by bayonets and rifle butts, three of whom spent the night at the Baolong Hospital. Initially, a Chinese police officer on duty saw Japanese soldiers climbing over the iron gate and quickly telephoned the police station. Before the police station received the call, the head constable had dispersed police teams at Wuzhen Road and the intersecting roads. After the Japanese soldiers crossed the bridge, they arbitrarily stabbed and beat Chinese people and shopkeepers on the road with bayonets and rifle butts. They continued to advance while attacking, eventually reaching the corner of Xin Zha Road and Meibaige Road. The head constable Fei Liepu and deputy head constable Lin, leading Chinese and Indian police officers, happened to arrive at the scene and saw Japanese soldiers attacking Chinese people on Xin Zha Road. The other Chinese people fled in panic and closed their shop doors. The police team then saw several Japanese soldiers on Wuzhen Road trying to drag a Chinese man with bayonet wounds across the bridge into the Zhabei area. The Chinese man struggled desperately and shouted for help. Head Constable Fei Liepu immediately stepped forward to intervene, stating that if they wanted to detain the Chinese man, they should do so through the appropriate authorities and report to the Xin Zha police station. The Japanese soldiers were furious and wanted to make trouble for Fei and Deputy Head Constable Lin. At this time, the Japanese soldiers chased after a Chinese man who was watching from the side. The Chinese man quickly hid behind Fei. The Xin Zha Road area was filled with noise and commotion. The Japanese soldiers then tried to detain a Chinese civilian on Park Road. When the Chinese detective who arrived in a police car was forcibly dragged across the bridge, he was also stopped by a police officer. However, the Japanese soldiers stubbornly refused to comply. Subsequently, a Japanese military officer who could speak English ordered the Japanese soldiers to stop. Many Japanese soldiers then returned to Zhabei. Within a minute or two, U.S. Army Major Quilo arrived with a team. Quilo then spoke with the Japanese military officer. The Japanese military officer stated that two Chinese police officers witnessed Chinese people throwing stones and did not intervene. He also demanded that Major Quilo guarantee that such actions would not occur again; otherwise, the Japanese soldiers would enter the concession again to take appropriate countermeasures. While the two were talking at length, several Japanese soldiers sneaked behind the American soldiers' team and tried to detain the Chinese detective they had previously failed to detain. Detective Peng Lait saw this and shielded him with his body, thus preventing the detention."</p>
<p>▲Report from the Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury: The Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reported: "Last night, seventy or eighty Japanese sailors left their posts in Zhabei, climbed over the iron gate and barbed wire on Wuzhen Road, and stabbed or beat Chinese people in the Xin Zha area with guns. Later, U.S. Army Major Quilo, accompanied by a platoon of American soldiers and the head constable of the Municipal Council police, firmly intervened, and the Japanese soldiers retreated to Zhabei. Currently, the Municipal Council and the consuls of the countries concerned have not taken any formal action regarding this matter, but it is believed that the authorities will present negotiations after obtaining a detailed report on the fact that the Japanese soldiers stationed in Zhabei entered the Public Concession without permission."</p>
<p>▲Opinions from American Officials: A Washington dispatch from the Guomin News Agency on the 3rd stated: "Today, the U.S. Department of War and the State Department have not yet received official reports regarding the incident in Shanghai, south of the Suzhou Creek, where Japanese soldiers and American soldiers nearly clashed. However, officials, based on reports in newspaper dispatches, expressed the opinion that they believe the American soldiers acted according to their duties and hope that this matter can be resolved quickly and smoothly on the spot."</p>
<h3>Ma Zhanshan's Reply to Huang Jinrong's Telegram</h3>
<p>▲Telegrams Can Be Sent Directly to Hailanpao</p>
<p>Huang Jinrong and others, having previously received a telegram from Chairman Ma Zhanshan, replied with condolences. Recently, they received another telegram from Chairman Ma Zhanshan, stating: "Huang Jinrong, Xu Jilong, Du Yuesheng, Wang Yiting, Wang Xiaolai, Shang Mujian, Xiang Kangyuan, Qiu Fenling, Wu Shan, and all the gentlemen, and all comrades: Your respectful telegram of the 30th has been received. I am deeply grateful for your gracious telegram of condolences, even though I have not yet received it. In the future, please send telegrams directly to Hailanpao, without going through Russia, as Russia is now trying to avoid suspicion from Japan and is unwilling to forward them. Japan is accustomed to using slanderous tricks. During the Jiangqiao battle last year, they claimed that our side had secret assistance from Russian military officers, which is why we dared to resist them. This time, when Zhanshan moved to Heihe, they said that we had considerable contact with Soviet Russia, otherwise we would not have dared to take this action, etc. This is directly measuring us Chinese people, saying that we have no independent fighting ability and cannot fight without foreign aid. Their contempt for our people is equivalent to that of women and children, which is extremely shameful. Zhanshan has now resolved to swear to wash away this shame, follow the instructions of the National Government, and lead his subordinates to fight, echoing the armies in Shanghai from afar. Although I dare not predict the success or failure in the future, I am fortunate to have the support of all the gentlemen and comrades in Shanghai, who will loudly call out to awaken the people and unite in common hatred, vowing to be our support. In the future, long-term resistance will surely succeed. The Republic of China truly relies on you. Ma Zhanshan, winter seal."</p>
<h3>Zhang Huichang's Telegram</h3>
<p>▲Strive Against Foreign Aggression, Do Not Participate in Civil War</p>
<p>Zhang Huichang sent a telegram to the air force comrades in Guangdong yesterday, stating: "To all air force comrades in Guangzhou: The national crisis is urgent, and the people are expecting you comrades to strive against foreign aggression. Now, I hear that disputes have suddenly arisen in Guangdong. I hope that you comrades will practice the declaration you have always made to the people, not to participate in civil war, and not to embark on the path of self-destruction due to temporary impulses. Then the country will be fortunate. Huichang, Zhi."</p>
<h3>True Cholera Discovered in Shanghai</h3>
<p>▲Occurring Earlier Than Ever Before</p>
<p>A doctor from the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital at 545 Xizang Road reported that the hospital has been open for more than ten years, and it has never seen cholera cases occur so early. Now, patients with true cholera have been admitted to the hospital for saline injections for several days in a row. It is hoped that citizens who have not contracted the disease will strictly avoid eating raw, cold, and unclean foods. Those who have contracted the disease should go to the hospital for treatment as soon as possible, day or night. It is also reported that the hospital has set up a special department to prevent the spread of cholera, specializing in cholera prevention serum injections. The injection time is from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM every day, and it is free of charge.</p>
<h3>Yu Youren's Doubts Regarding Sun Ke's Talk</h3>
<p>▲Abandoning Tutelage and the Crisis of the Chinese Revolution</p>
<p>Mr. Yu Youren recently published a long article, which is excerpted below:</p>
<p>In the current situation of China, to still trace back to the past of the revolution is already a very tragic matter. The main force of the revolution is gradually declining, the leadership of the revolution is increasingly shaking, and even the object of the revolution and the beliefs and will of the revolutionaries are becoming increasingly blurred. If we admit that the Chinese revolution has not been completed, then we cannot destroy the party and claim it is a remedy. Recently, those responsible within the party, often due to the severity of the national crisis and facing accusations from the outside world, advocate for a hasty constitutional government, sacrificing themselves to please others. We are heartbroken by the national crisis and dare not agree with them, so we express our doubts to question the wise. The arguments recently published by Comrade Zhesheng, as recorded in various newspapers, unintentionally fall into serious errors. When the national crisis first arose, we pointed out that various parties had this tendency to destroy the party to save the country, and we strongly argued that if the party is destroyed, the country cannot be saved in the end. Now, unfortunately, Zhesheng's words are so easily exploited by others. Summarizing his arguments, one point is that the current central government cannot lead the national masses, which is undeniable. Another point is that the party's credibility has been completely lost, and if we want to remedy this, we must have the determination to reform thoroughly. We truly do not know how these affirmed premises are established. Does it mean that the current party's regime cannot lead the national masses? If so, then where is the one who can lead? Is it the Communist Party? Is it the Nationalist faction? Is it the re-emergence of warlords and bureaucrats? Any revolutionary party or political movement that can obtain revolutionary leadership and a certain form of regime must have its historical background and the sure conditions of society, which cannot be achieved by fantasy. Nor can it be achieved by unwarranted self-deprecation. The party's ability to lead the Chinese national revolution is naturally based on the determination of objective facts. The Communist Party's method of transcending the economic stage cannot be pushed forward, and the Nationalist faction's method of representing a narrow national viewpoint and guild economic ideas cannot be pulled back. If it is said to be the warlords and bureaucrats, then can these remnants of the era and dregs of the revolution emerge from the tombs and take over the regime? Is there such a reason? If it is said that the people should govern themselves through constitutional government, then after the Republic of China, the Republic has been destroyed several times, and even the law has disappeared without a trace. If there was no revolutionary party persevering, then what is called the Republic of China today would have long been impossible to ask about. Since Zhesheng has the above affirmation, he advocates preparing for the implementation of constitutional government, believing that the period of tutelage has been four years, merely in name, with no effect to speak of. If this continues, time will not wait for us, so he advocates starting preparations for constitutional government quickly, without waiting for the end of the tutelage. Moreover, the unfinished work of local self-government can be carried out simultaneously after the start of constitutional government, without waiting for its completion. He also said that resistance to Japan cannot be achieved by the government's individual strength today, but only through cooperation between the government and the people can the final result be achieved. Once constitutional government is established, the government and the people will be united, and the strength of resistance to Japan will naturally be strong, etc. Since we know the sequential relationship between tutelage and constitutional government, with the start of constitutional government dependent on the completion of tutelage, how can tutelage be ended prematurely and constitutional government suddenly appear? Did the Republic of China not have a provisional constitution? Its essence was equal to a constitution. There was indeed a constitutional political system. The restoration of the imperial system was like a fox burying its prey, only to have another fox dig it up. Later, Cao Kun used bribery to become president, and the yellow satin constitution displayed at Tiananmen Square still remains in history, still flowing with residual filth. The constitution was in place, and constitutional government was implemented, but where was the Republic of China that was sought through revolution? Now, once again, the old things are brought up, with the clamorous voices of the crowd, eagerly as if they cannot wait, being the same people who legislate to destroy the law and govern to ruin governance. All constitutional governments come from revolution, and there has never been anyone who does not vow to carry out revolutionary doctrines but can immediately implement the rule of law. Those people did not completely crush the revolutionary party members in the past, exterminated the seeds of revolution, and on one hand, they echoed the imperial system, the restoration, and bribery. Later, they came to echo party rule, but ultimately disliked its inconvenience, and so today they think of a way to remove its foundation. The so-called ending of tutelage is ending the party's leadership of the revolution, lightly masking its traces with the beautiful name of constitutional government. In addition, there are so-called transcendent scholars and famous figures in the opposition, all echoing constitutional government, praising it to the skies. Their ambitions are admirable, but their actions are often mistaken. Under revolutionary politics, there is no such thing as transcendence; in a revolutionary environment, there is no such thing as being in the opposition. If they all exercise the four powers, they have already controlled the governing tools. If they must borrow other means to seek so-called constitutional government, they will appropriately open their arms to the counter-revolutionary groups, which is regrettable. This is still speaking in terms of personnel. As for constitutional government itself, the hasty creation of the Republic of China caused the Premier to feel extremely regretful for not first implementing tutelage. Like building a building, it is necessary to have a solid foundation, so that military governance has just ended, and constitutional government has already begun. If this method of crossing a bridge can be effective, then there would not have been successive disturbances after the Republic of China, and the National Founding Program would not have required the Premier to create a system. It is unexpected that Zhesheng would have uniquely lost this teaching in the family. If self-government is not completed, then tutelage is an empty shell; if tutelage is not experienced, then constitutional government is a mere formality. All the past efforts and sacrifices of the Kuomintang were first to obtain tutelage in order to create a revolutionary constitutional government. If only the articles of the constitution and the government organization are considered constitutional government, then the democratic movement of the bourgeoisie is certainly capable of it, and to say that this can unite the government and the people is simply deceiving the masses. As for saying that local self-government can be carried out simultaneously after the start of constitutional government, we truly do not know why the root is abandoned in favor of pursuing the branches. Now, taking the will of a few people as golden rules and jade laws, destroying the Premier's doctrines to destroy the party and destroy the government, this is removing the weapons for the counter-revolutionary groups. How can it be seen as possible? Moreover, tutelage is to use the Premier's doctrines to provide tutelage. We are the Premier's followers and servants of the people. If the task is not done well, we should condemn ourselves before the Premier and the people, and there is no way to change the Premier's teachings. Otherwise, we should not cause disturbances that increasingly trap the country in lawlessness. Therefore, under this meaning, the sincere unity within the party and the people's joint efforts to overcome difficulties are the only key to solving the national crisis and the only path to overcoming the national crisis. Now, desperately seeking a path in all directions, how can there be a proper one? Only by being truly able to unite and make joint efforts, holding on with a strong and persistent heart, can we defend ourselves and resist insults, and not worry about having no methods. Even if there is a national crisis, there is nothing to fear. Therefore, on the part of the party members, they must carefully choose how to conduct themselves, diligently encourage courage, be the vanguard of the people, and never forget the responsibility of building and governing the country. On the part of the people, they should also supervise the party and the government from a positive perspective, so that they will fight without surrendering or losing rights, and concentrate their efforts on the common path. If this is the case, then the whole country will be truly united, and we will surely be able to resolve the national crisis and promote the success of the revolution in the shortest possible time.

<h3>Yan Yutang Kidnapped</h3>
<p>▲This is the Second Time</p>
<p>▲He Has No Savings</p>
<p>Yan Yutang, a local, 53 years old, residing at 1 Pingliang Road, Yangshupu, left home yesterday morning around 8:30 AM in his own car, number 8967, to go to the Guangyu Business Company at 58 Jiangxi Road to handle business. When the car arrived at the entrance of number 58, it stopped abruptly. As Yan was about to get out of the car, three thugs suddenly jumped out from the roadside, all holding weapons. Two bandits helped Yan back into the car, and one bandit opened the door, got into the driver's seat, and threatened the driver, Gao Asi, with a pistol to drive at full speed towards the south. When they reached the Avenue Edward VII intersection, the bandits pushed Gao out of the car, then turned the steering wheel themselves and sped off to the west. Afterwards, the driver reported to the police station and requested an investigation, but there was no progress to be reported at the time. Yan had been kidnapped once before in the spring of the previous year on Huade Road. At that time, he was sitting in a chartered car and was shot in the left foot by the bandits. His Guangyu Business Company manages the products of the Zhabei Dalong Iron Factory and the Suzhou Sulun Textile Factory, so Yan holds three positions in one person. However, because he came from a humble background, he is extremely frugal and has been enthusiastic about social welfare throughout his life, running three voluntary schools. It is said that he only has a business and no savings. He goes to the company to handle business every morning, entering and leaving alone, without hiring bodyguards. He has six sons, who are divided into Sulun, Dalong, and Guangyu services. The remaining two sons are still studying, with one studying in the United States and one in the country. It is also reported that the car number 8967 was found in western Shanghai last night.</p>
<h3>Old Goods Store Privately Purchases Large Amount of Gunpowder</h3>
<p>▲ Weighing 230 Pounds</p>
<p>▲ Accomplices Attempt to Profit</p>
<p>▲ Detected and Arrested by Police</p>
<p>▲ Court Has Already Conducted Preliminary Hearing</p>
<p>The "Gonghexing" old goods store, located at 864 Beijing Road and owned by He Chenpu, had recently purchased a substantial quantity of gunpowder from places like Datong, weighing a total of 230 pounds. At approximately 8:00 AM the day before yesterday, the gunpowder was divided and loaded into three burlap sacks, with old copper and scrap iron mixed in to conceal it. They hired a rickshaw puller, Qian Xiaosanzi from Jiangbei, and Li Haidao, with his rickshaw, intending to transport the goods to a certain fireworks shop in the Hongqiao area of the West Gate. As the rickshaw passed through Xizang Road, they were suddenly stopped by four detectives: Miao Baosheng (nicknamed "Little Guangdong") from Changzhou, and Lu Bosheng, a local. They suspected that the rickshaw was carrying explosive gunpowder and violating the law, so they ordered the rickshaw to stop and forcibly transported it to 277 Huile Lane, Yunnan Road, for storage. At the same time, Qian and Li were taken to the Qingliange teahouse on Fuzhou Road and held captive, intending to make a move. However, the plan was not kept secret, and the Laozha Police Station learned of it. They dispatched Western Inspector Howell, Chinese detectives Yang Xinzheng and Lang Zuyin to Huile Lane, where they seized the gunpowder. They then went to the Qingliange teahouse and arrested Qian Xiaosanzi and Li Haidao. Subsequently, they proceeded to the Gonghexing old goods store on Beijing Road and arrested two shop assistants, Wang Guiqing from Suzhou and Fang Chunquan. The store owner, He Chenpu, was not arrested because he happened to be in Datong. Later, Lu Bosheng was arrested on Ningbo Road and taken into custody. Soon after, Miao Baosheng also surrendered himself to the police station. They were separately detained. Yesterday morning, they were all transferred to the First Special District Court, Criminal Division One. The police lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, stood up and presented the case, stating that the police are prosecuting Qian, Li, Wang, and Fang under Articles 44 (accomplice) and 201 (public endangerment) of the criminal law. Miao and Lu are being prosecuted under Article 316 (obstruction of freedom) of the criminal law, etc. According to the statements of the Chinese and Western detectives, Qian Xiaosanzi and Li Haidao confessed that they were hired by Wang and Fang to transport the sacks to Hongqiao. At the time, they only knew that the contents were old copper. As the rickshaw passed through Xizang Road, Miao and Lu stopped them and dragged the rickshaw into Huile Lane on Yunnan Road. At the same time, they were taken to the Qingliange teahouse and guarded by Lu. Later, detectives arrived and took them to the police station. Wang and Fang claimed that the gunpowder was purchased by the store owner and that they were delivering it to a fireworks shop yesterday, etc. Miao Baosheng testified that yesterday morning, he encountered Lu Bosheng and a rickshaw on Xizang Road. Lu told him that the rickshaw was carrying contraband gunpowder and instructed him to quickly telegraph Inspector Wang Changgen of the General Police Station. He then hired a rickshaw to go to a nearby location to make a phone call. At that time, Inspector Wang was not there, so he returned to Yunnan Road, but the people and goods were gone, saying they had been taken away by the police. He then surrendered himself to the police station, etc. Lu Bosheng confessed that yesterday, he was informed by a Mr. Jiang that Qian's rickshaw was carrying gunpowder, so he stopped them. He admitted to reporting to Inspector Wang. The defendants' lawyers, Fan Gangtao and Wu Zhi, requested bail for the defendants. Judge Qian Hongye reviewed the testimonies and ordered the case to be postponed for seven days for further questioning. Qian Xiaosanzi and Li Haidao were released on bail, while Wang Guiqing and Fang Chunquan were released on a 500-yuan surety from their shop. Miao Baosheng and Lu Bosheng were detained.</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Investigates Losses of Cooperative Societies in War Zone</h3>
<p>The cooperative societies in this city are known to be well-developed, with a large number located in the Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Wusong areas. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai Incident, the cooperative societies in the war zone have suffered significant losses due to the war, which caused the dispersion of members and the suspension of operations. For months, the losses have been substantial. In order to thoroughly understand the exact amount of war-related losses suffered by each cooperative society, the Social Affairs Bureau has specially created a survey form and is beginning the investigation. However, since the addresses of many cooperative societies in the war zone have changed, and the forms cannot be delivered, all cooperative societies are requested to promptly and voluntarily come to the bureau to obtain and fill out the forms for statistical compilation.</p>
<h3>Reasons for Closure of Banque Belge pour l'Étranger in Peiping</h3>
<p>The branch of the Banque Belge pour l'Étranger (Belgian Bank for Foreign Affairs) established in Peiping was originally dedicated to negotiating railway matters with the government. Now that the government has moved south and commerce in Beijing is gradually declining, the head office in Brussels sees no need to maintain the branch, so it has ordered the branch to close at the end of this year. In recent years, all matters related to negotiating with the government have been handled by the Shanghai branch of the Banque Belge pour l'Étranger, which is more convenient.</p>
<p>According to the Continental Daily News, it was learned yesterday (2nd) that the Shanghai branch of the Banque Belge pour l'Étranger has received instructions from its head office in Brussels to temporarily suspend operations from July 1st. All depositors and holders of the bank's banknotes are requested to withdraw their money or redeem their banknotes before July 1st. Regarding the banknotes, the Citibank is being consulted to handle the redemption after July 1st. The reason for the bank's decision to temporarily suspend operations is clearly due to the commercial stagnation after the Japanese occupation of Shenyang and the invasion of Zhabei, which caused the bank's business to plummet and made it difficult to recover.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Certifies Nationality of Kangtai Insurance Company</h3>
<p>The British Kangtai Insurance Company at 18 Bund, this city, is a purely British commercial firm. Its head office was established in London 27 years ago, and its branches, in addition to Shanghai, are all located within the United Kingdom and British territories.

It is reported that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has received solid proof from the British Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, confirming that the company is indeed a British commercial firm.</p>
<h3>Ruihe Company Manufactures High-Quality Domestic Crucibles</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' Association for the Promotion of Domestic Goods has repeatedly received letters and telegrams from factories manufacturing glass, enamel, batteries, and other products, inquiring about the production of domestic crucibles. The investigation department of the association has found that the Xiaoshadu Ruihe Brick and Tile Company produces such crucibles, which are of excellent quality and superior to foreign products. According to the person in charge of the company, crucibles are essential for melting glass materials, enamelware, and electric light bulbs, and have traditionally been imported. In order to promote domestic production and recover lost revenue, the company initiated manufacturing, and has received awards from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's National Goods Exhibition and other organizations. However, due to the pressure of raw material costs, sales declined, and production was suspended. Now, with the deepening of national crisis, public resentment is growing, and everyone is determined to reject foreign goods. In response to the urging and needs of factories nationwide, the company is expanding its scale and resuming manufacturing. They have hired Mr. Guo Yongkang, a specialist in overseas Chinese industry, to meticulously plan and manage engineering work, and have recruited patriotic workers who left foreign factories to work together and intensify research. The results are excellent, surpassing foreign products in quality. Production is abundant, sufficient to meet the needs of factories nationwide. In order to encourage the production of new domestic raw materials, the association has sent letters to various factories encouraging promotion and sales, and has submitted a request to the Ministry of Industry for a patent to promote the craft.</p>

It is reported that Mr. Wang is scheduled to go to Hangzhou this morning to guide the branch, and after finishing the work, he will detour to Suzhou, bringing several sets of Zhen Shan Mei harmonicas, which he supervised the production of, to present to the loyal and brave soldiers. At the same time, he will also teach them his new composition, the "19th Route Army" military song, to encourage morale.</p>
<h3>Minhang Orphans' Home Sells Preserved Mustard Greens</h3>
<p>The Minhang Guangci Orphans' Home has stored preserved mustard greens for various applications. According to the investigation, the institution currently has 376 sealed jars and 76 vats, weighing approximately 700 dan (approximately 35 metric tons). As the weather is getting warmer, these preserved mustard greens are hygienic and palatable. Whether companies, factories, or organizations need them, they can contact the Minnan Steamship Bureau on the Bund in Nanshi for wholesale or retail purchases. After placing an order, the products can be delivered. The profits from these sales will be used to fund the institution's expenses, so those who purchase them will also be performing charitable acts.</p>
<h3>Tan Meiying Files for Divorce for the Second Time</h3>
<p>▲ Zhao Guangzu Did Not Appear in Court Yesterday</p>
<p>▲ Rescheduled for Further Hearing on the 16th</p>
<p>Zhao Guangzu was once infatuated with prostitutes and formed an inextricable bond with the prostitute Mei Fei. He secretly took the deeds of his house and land and gave them to Mei Fei for safekeeping. The prostitute colluded with Hu San and privately mortgaged them. Zhao Lou Tan Meiying later learned of this and filed a lawsuit against Mei Fei and others for embezzlement, which has been accepted and concluded by the court. She also filed a civil lawsuit against Zhao for abandonment, requesting a divorce. After the court summoned and questioned her, it found that the plaintiff's reasons were insufficient and dismissed the case. At the time, Ms. Tan was very dissatisfied and declared an appeal. Subsequently, through the mediation of friends from both sides, Zhao also deeply regretted his actions and accepted all the conditions proposed by Ms. Tan, including abstaining from prostitution. Therefore, Ms. Tan withdrew the appeal and renewed the vows of lifelong companionship. Unexpectedly, not long after, Zhao Guangzu relapsed and became involved with a dancer, Hu A-liu, at a certain dance hall. From then on, Zhao and Tan fell out again. Zhao did not continue to fulfill the terms of the previous agreement. Ms. Tan was abandoned and hired lawyer Jiang Yiping at the end of last year to sue Zhao for abandonment in the First Special District Court. The complaint has already been published in the newspapers, so I will not repeat it here. Yesterday afternoon was the date for the court hearing. The plaintiff, Tan Meiying, and lawyer Jiang arrived on time. Ms. Tan's charm remained as before, but the defendant, Zhao Guangzu, did not appear in court and only sent lawyer He as a representative. He stated that all the plaintiff's allegations lacked supporting evidence and were unreliable. Moreover, before marriage, the plaintiff studied at school, and the tuition fees were all paid by the defendant. All the expenses for the woman's side at the time of marriage, as well as the dowry fee, were also paid by the defendant. The defendant's treatment of the plaintiff can be said to be benevolent and righteous. Although the plaintiff has filed for divorce again, the defendant still hopes that the plaintiff can repent and return soon to maintain the family's happiness. The judge instructed that the parties should appear in person to express their intentions, so he ordered that the hearing be postponed to the afternoon of May 16th to summon the defendant to court for questioning.</p>
<h3>Negotiations Initiated Over Dismissal of Teacher at Peicheng Girls' School</h3>
<p>▲ Mediation Once Failed</p>
<p>Cao Jinyuan, the acting principal of Peicheng Girls' School on Xiaoshadu Road, was notified by the Shanghai First Special District Court yesterday upon the request of Lin Peizhen, a teacher at the school, for mediation. Lin Peizhen appointed lawyer Song Yunhui as her representative, and Cao Jinyuan also appointed lawyer He Shimei as her representative. Both parties were represented by their agents. Judge Tao Junde opened the court for mediation, but it failed. It is reported that Lin Peizhen's reasons for requesting mediation were that she was hired to teach at the school last year and received notification from the school this year. However, the school suddenly sent a letter stating that she had written to the school saying that she would not be able to come to school to teach and that another person had been hired to replace her. Lin Peizhen claimed that she did not write such a letter and that she could not be dismissed midway. After repeated negotiations, Cao Jinyuan's attitude was tough, and she even verbally abused Lin Peizhen, so she had no choice but to meet in court. Lin Peizhen is demanding repayment of one month's salary and compensation for damages of six months' salary for the current semester. Since mediation has failed, litigation may be unavoidable, which is an unfortunate event for the education sector.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>I was quite surprised to read a news item entitled "The Dade Steamer Case Resolved" in the local news section of your esteemed newspaper on the 4th of this month. Since the tragic Dade incident occurred on December 13th of last year, Fu Bao has been entrusted by the families concerned to handle the registration matters. While in the process of collecting documents and conducting investigations, the Shanghai Incident occurred, and the matter was suspended. We are now prepared to file a lawsuit with the Shanghai District Court, requesting compensation according to the law. The assertion in your newspaper that the Dada Company has withdrawn tens of thousands of yuan to be distributed to the families is something that Fu Bao and the families he represents have never heard of. We are sincerely concerned that the outside world will not understand the truth, leading to misunderstandings, so we have specially written this letter to clarify matters, hoping that you will make a correction. Respectfully addressed to Mr. Editor of Shenbao, Fu Bao, Lawyer, May 4th.</p>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>Your esteemed newspaper stated in the local news section on May 3rd that "Dong Manni, a Jiangxi native, was arrested by Chinese detective Cao Qishan of the Laozha Police Station at the intersection of Zhejiang Road and Simalu at 1:10 PM the day before yesterday, shouting reactionary slogans while holding reactionary leaflets. He also had several companions gathering and marching. He confessed that there were more leaflets and books hidden at 76 Avenue du President Haig, French Concession, and 141 Xinxin Lane, Rue du Pere Froc. The police station of the French Concession was notified and the police jointly searched and found quite a lot of reactionary books..." I was extremely astonished after reading this. My family lives at 76 Avenue du President Haig and makes a living by teaching. On May 1st, it is true that a Jiangxi student named Dong Manni was brought to my residence by detectives, who pointed to my residence as his address, but at that time, my family had already clearly denied it. However, the detectives ignored the reasons and went straight upstairs into the house, arbitrarily taking away several volumes of Chinese and foreign books displayed on the bookshelves. Upon investigation, 76 Avenue du President Haig is my residence, and the books are all owned by me. They were not hidden by others and have no connection with Dong Manni. Moreover, all the above-mentioned books, whether in Chinese or foreign languages, are openly and legally published by major bookstores in China or foreign countries. However, your newspaper reported "quite a lot of reactionary books were found," which is clearly an inaccurate report. I respectfully request that you publish this letter, because I am currently pursuing a lawsuit in court, and the word "reactionary" cannot be easily applied to people. With respectful greetings, Li Jianhua, 76 Avenue du President Haig, May 4th.</p>

<h3>Preparing to Celebrate Teachers' Day on June 6th</h3>
<p>丨Goals of This Holiday Movement丨</p>
<p>(1) Improve Teachers' Salaries</p>
<p>(2) Safeguard Teachers' Status</p>
<p>(3) Enhance Teachers' Well-being</p>
<p>The organizers of Teachers' Day issued a notice stating: "Respected sirs, we have initiated the designation of June 6th as Teachers' Day (or Double Sixth Day) in order to improve the salaries, stabilize the status, and enhance the well-being of education personnel. The first celebration was held on June 6th of last year at the National Central University in the capital, with over 300 comrades from the education sector in Beijing and Shanghai attending, creating a grand occasion. The date of this year's festival is approaching rapidly. As we recall the past year, with floods, wars, migrations, and displacement, the halls of learning across the country are on the verge of collapse. We feel even more strongly the need for this year's Teachers' Day to be celebrated jointly by people across the country. We are attaching a declaration and requesting that you promote it nearby and jointly petition the Ministry of Education to issue a clear decree stipulating that this day shall be Teachers' Day from now on, and to issue a notice to the whole country to hold celebrations uniformly. If you have any declarations, writings, reports, or other documents related to this holiday, please send a copy so that we can compile them into a booklet for publicity purposes. We would be extremely grateful. Respectfully submitted for your consideration. Please send letters via Mr. Shuangqiu, Henan University, Kaifeng, April 29th."</p>
<p>▲ Declaration: In modern social movements, it is customary to establish a permanent memorial day, such as Labor Day, Children's Day, and Women's Day, all of which are designed to unite the masses to improve the lives and status of a portion of the population, directly benefiting that portion of the population and indirectly benefiting the entire society. Because the general public in society is blinded by prejudice and complacent with the old ways, they often become accustomed to the pain in the lives of a portion of the population and do not notice it. Without a widespread movement, it is impossible to shift the atmosphere and change perceptions in order to achieve improvement. This is why the establishment of a memorial day is indispensable. We deeply feel that today's education personnel in China bear the heaviest responsibilities and face the strictest demands from society. However, their lives are the most unstable, their status is the most precarious, and they lack opportunities for self-improvement. All of these factors affect their careers and prevent them from fulfilling their responsibilities. This is not only the personal suffering of education personnel but also a major loss to the entire society. It is a well-known fact that the salaries of elementary school teachers are insufficient to support their families. Even university and middle school teachers often experience panic due to unpaid salaries, are unable to afford medical care when ill because schools are stingy with their salaries, and are dismissed from their positions when they are old and overwhelmed because schools do not have a system of seniority-based pay increases. If they unfortunately die in service, their families are left destitute and freezing because schools do not have a system of compensation. As a result, the children of university professors are often unable to attend university, and the children of middle school and elementary school teachers cannot afford to attend middle school and elementary school. What could be more unfair than this? This is why the lives of teachers are so unstable and why it is imperative to strive for improvement. As for the status of teachers, in reality, their advancement and demotion are often determined by the likes and dislikes of students and other special reasons, regardless of their educational achievements or their integrity in handling affairs. This already lacks any protection, and is further affected by political changes, the replacement of principals, factional infighting, and social exclusion, often creating a situation where they cannot guarantee their livelihoods from morning to evening, preventing them from making long-term plans or accumulating gradual achievements. How can they be expected to engage in academic research and improve teaching? Employers in society are still bound by contracts, but the hiring of teachers lacks any protection. This is why the status of teachers is so precarious and why it is imperative to strive for improvement. Furthermore, the cultivation of excellent teachers relies entirely on the support of society. However, the usual practice is to only know how to test and eliminate teachers who lack self-improvement, and often fail to seek remedies for those who have been eliminated. As for those who are more deeply self-improved, they are burdened with extremely heavy teaching duties, leaving them no time for research. This approach is tantamount to cutting off teachers' path to further study and abandoning their useful talents. Even those with excellent academic abilities will be forever buried and unable to develop, and those who are less skilled will have no hope of improvement. This is not the teachers' own self-abandonment, but rather the mismanagement of the country and society, which has led to this situation. This is why teachers lack opportunities for professional self-improvement and why it is imperative to strive to enhance them. We are deeply aware of this and want to unite people across the country to rise up and save the situation, hoping to promote the government's attention and society's awareness, and have designated June 6th as Teachers' Day in order to gather the strength of the masses to seek fundamental solutions. All of us in the education sector, regardless of whether we are teachers in universities, middle schools, or elementary schools, or education administrators, hope to participate uniformly in order to achieve the effect of a fortress built with the will of the people. As for why we have designated June 6th, we have taken the Double Sixth name for the holiday to make it easier to rally support, and it is also appropriate because it is the end of the academic year and the time when plans for the next academic year are waiting to be finalized. At this time, we can contribute our opinions to the education authorities and express our grievances to the general public, hoping to achieve gradual improvement each year. As for the goals of this holiday movement, they are none other than the following three points: (1) Improve teachers' salaries, (2) Safeguard teachers' status, (3) Enhance teachers' well-being. All of this only outlines the general framework of the movement and indicates its purpose. As for the detailed methods, they are awaiting the public's response. We are only individuals with humble voices, but this kind of problem is deeply and greatly related to the rise and fall of the entire education system and the security of society.

<p>Sports</p>
<h3>Large-Scale North China Sports Field (Continued)</h3>
<p>▲Swimming Pool: The boundaries of the pool are 20 meters long and 8 meters wide.

<p>▲Gymnasium: The east-west length is 25 meters, and the north-south width is 15 meters. Inside, a basketball court of 22 meters long and 12 meters wide can be created. A 1.3-meter-wide sloped running track (also serving as a viewing platform) is built around the upper part. A door is opened in the middle of the north end of the east wall, with stairs set up outside for spectators to enter and exit. The west part of the north wall is shared with the swimming pool, with a door opening to connect with the swimming pool. The west wall is shared with the office, with a door opening in the middle to connect with the office. Various fitness exercise equipment can also be installed on the interior walls and beams.</p>
<p>▲Ice Skating Rink: Ice skating is a sport suitable for men and women of all ages and should be set up in the children's playground. It is 15 meters long and wide, surrounded by a 3-foot-high railing. A door opens on the north side to connect with the flower pavilion.</p>

<h3>The Final Day of the Spring Gold Competition: Gold Prices Trend Down Three Taels</h3>
<p>▲Six Taels of Fluctuations in Half a Day: Yesterday was the last day of the spring competition. The gold market was still open for half a day in the morning and closed in the afternoon. The bid price fluctuated slightly, advancing and retreating erratically. There were six taels of fluctuations between the morning and noon sessions, eventually trending down by about three taels. Initially, the silver market fell slightly, opening lower, but the foreign exchange market remained stable. Furthermore, with active buying on the surface, a new price of 747 taels and 2 mace was seen. Afterward, it secretly weakened, and rumors arose that the situation between Japan and Russia was becoming urgent again. It seems that the bulls had already sold off, leading to a downward trend, depreciating by more than five taels. People were hesitant. It is heard that a certain bank is continuing to bid for all spot gold. The morning market situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲The Past of a Morning Market: It opened early with the June price at 742 taels and 5 mace, immediately falling by 2 taels and 6 mace. The major bars only decreased by one-eighth, and the silver price fell by one-quarter according to both public and private telegrams. According to floor reports, there were very few sellers, so people seemed to be bearish. Then, from 42 taels to 43 taels and 5 mace, Henger, Bingxing, Hongkang, Yongshun, and Li bought in, causing the price to gradually rise by three taels, but there were fluctuations of several cents. When the British gold announcement was unchanged and the US gold decreased slightly by 0.125, it rose to 46 taels and 5 mace. Then, due to sales by Tongyi, Taichang, and Fuchang, it immediately dropped by 2 taels to 44 taels and 5 mace. The domestic US gold market was flat. Initially, the British and Japanese banks traded June at 30 yuan, then at 29.75 yuan. Because Tongyi, Chunfu, Yuyuan, Cheng Yong, and others competed to buy, the price immediately rose to 47 taels and 2 mace (the highest price of the day) at just after 9:10. Later, Fuyu, Zhifeng, Yongda, Decheng, Yuanchun, and physical hedgers successively sold, to US gold for August at 30.025 yuan, so it dropped by more than four taels. There was a fluctuation of more than one tael in just over ten minutes, reaching 42 taels and 5 mace at just after 9:30. Later, the Dalian gang bought in, causing a rise of two taels, but Fuyu, Yuhe, and Yuantai sold, so it retreated by 1.67 mace. People were uncertain. After 10:15, a recovery was suddenly seen, because Hengxing, Hengyu, Neixing, Daxing, Yongyi, and speculators came to drag in. It is said that British gold still settled at 625, and there were rumors that a certain bank had purchased spot goods. The market price soared to 46 taels and 8 mace at 10:30. Afterward, waves arose, and rumors spread of a conflict between Japan and Russia. Operators' minds immediately weakened. It is estimated that Hengyu, Yuanmao, Yongfu, Fuyu, Futai, Hengyi, and the Dalian gang vigorously divested, and general retail bulls sold along with them, hoping to break even. Because of this, the market price plummeted by more than five taels (but there were more than two taels of fluctuations from 10:30 to 11:45). It seems that US gold forward contracts were traded at 30.025 yuan, and recent contracts could be settled at 29.9375 yuan. Until finally at 11:40, it was 41 taels and 3 mace. At that time, physical goods were bought in, pulling it up by more than two taels, to 2.5 taels. When the market closed at noon, it was 42 taels and 2 mace, a decrease of 2.9 mace compared to the previous noon (a reversal of the many days of consecutive increases).</p>
<p>▲Revealed Price Suppressed by 75 Taels: Based on the highest price of 47 taels and 2 mace and the lowest price of 41 taels and 3 mace in half a day, there was a difference of 5.9 taels. The revealed price was changed to 816 taels, a suppression of 70 to 75 taels. The account registration and water replenishment were both 42 taels, and the plain bars were estimated to add 5 taels.</p>
<p>▲Speculators Mostly Selling: Transactions on the surface were quite complicated. Statistics show that Hengxing, Yuanmao Yong, Daxing Yong, Yifeng Yong, Bingxing, Hongkang Yong, Tongchun, and Yuhe were mostly buying, while Hengyu, Fuchang, Fuyu, Wanxing, Shunli, and Dacheng were entering and exiting frequently. However, there were many receipts and no urgent payments. Yuantai, Futai Heng, Tong Taichang, and Yuankangxiang were mostly selling.</p>
<h3>Forex Market Apparently Tight, Secretly Loose</h3>
<p>Yesterday, although the silver market fell, the HSBC listed exchange rates only saw the US dollar shrink by 0.125 to 29.5 yuan, Hong Kong decreased by 0.25 to 76.375 taels, the French franc decreased slightly by one yuan, and the Japanese yen decreased by 0.25. Other currencies such as British, Indian, German, and Dutch currencies were neither good nor bad. As for the domestic market, it was also calm. The British gold rate remained unchanged from the previous day, but the US dollar fluctuated slightly, initially flat and then firm, but loose again at noon. Compared with the previous noon, it increased by 0.1875, which can be described as an apparently tight but secretly loose situation. Chinese merchants' transactions still did not involve large amounts. It is estimated that British gold only involved 20,000 to 30,000 pounds for Bombay telegraphic sales in July, and US dollars involved about 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. Sales from British and American companies to Japanese banks were still not uncommon. The Guangdong gang Hengxing slightly sold off and then hedged into bars. The hedging price was recently pulled open to 45 to 46 taels, and the forward price was estimated to be about 50 taels. Even if they wanted to settle the differences, it would still not be agreed upon. Today, various gold shops still have many firsts and short Citibank, but the amounts are not large. The aftermarket is still closed for the Spring Competition period.</p>
<p>▲British Exchange Rate: The domestic market only fluctuated by 0.0625. In the morning, the opening selling price was 1 shilling, 7 pence, 0.0625 to 0.06875, and the buying price was 0.06875 to 0.075. Macgalli sold August at 0.0625, Sumitomo bought July at 0.06875, and Mitsui bought at 0.075 (all Bombay orders). The closing selling price at noon was similar to the morning market.</p>
<p>▲American Exchange Rate: The domestic market only had a difference of 0.125 in half a day. There was a difference of 0.25 between near and forward months. Since the early opening selling price was 29.875 yuan for May, 29.9375 yuan for June, and 30 yuan for July, the buying prices were all increased by 0.125. Macgalli and Zhengjin traded June at 30 yuan, Mitsui bought August at 30 yuan, Wahbi and Zhengjin Mitsui traded June at 29.875 yuan, Anda and Zhengjin traded this month at 0.075, Citibank and Zhengjin traded June at 0.0875, Pan Gen bought August at 30.0625 yuan, Macgalli bought August at 0.1875, and Mitsui and He Lan traded October at 30.025 yuan. Wahbi and Zhengjin traded June at 29.9375 yuan. The closing selling prices at noon were 29.9375 yuan for May, 30 yuan for June, 30.125 yuan for July, and 30.1875 yuan for August. The buying price was 30.0625 to 30.3125 yuan. The listed exchange rate was also 3 taels, 3 mace, 8 fen, and 0.0098 for one yuan of silver.</p>
<h3>Large Bars Slightly Longer</h3>
<p>A National Society telegram from London on the 4th stated that the large bars were slightly longer, with the closing price at 16 pence 0.0625 for the near term and 16 pence 0.075 for the forward term, each longer by 0.0625 than the previous day. The London exchange rate for New York opened at 3 yuan and 68 cents.</p>
<h3>Amidst the Sound of Recovery, the Foreign Market Sees Another Huge Drop</h3>
<p>▲Sparse Sales to Customers: Shanghai Inventory Remains the Same</p>
<p>▲Market Overview: The past two days, the foreign cent market has seen a very strong upward trend. Everyone thought that it could rise rapidly from now on. Suddenly yesterday afternoon, there was a reversal, and the decline was no less than the rise. The reason is that the front stomach in foreign ports is very rare, while the bottom of the street stock is piled up. If the bank has no buying stomach, then the cent price is stable. Although the development of various industries and merchants' goods, such as the category rate of silver, the total income is more than foreign funds, and finally the decline reappears.</p>
<p>▲Cent-Share Prices: "Foreign cents" had no change in the early market, still at 7 mace and 9 cents, the same as the early market the day before. Although the afternoon market was due to the courage of sellers, the takers turned few, and suddenly fell 1.25 cents, only 7 mace and 7.25 cents. "Silver shares" were borrowed for free in the early market, and there was a slight transaction in the afternoon market, so the city opened at 2 fen. The bank did not list the dividing head, so it was divided for free, and then there was an 8-fen market, but finally it was still divided for free.</p>
<p>▲Subsidiary Coin Market: The Jiangnan small ocean suddenly soared by 3 cents in the morning, to 6 mace, 1 fen, and 4 cents. The afternoon market did not move. It is said that this transaction is extremely small. Although there is no huge amount of money to buy, there is also the possibility of soaring. The transaction in the early market was 4,000 jiao, and 2,000 jiao in the early market. Guangdong small ocean also suddenly rose by about 3 cents in the early market, to 6 mace and 8.5 cents. The afternoon market turned weak, to 6 mace and 7.25 cents. The transaction was 80,000 jiao in the early market and 20,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins continued to fall, shrinking by another 2,000 articles, to 415,500 articles. It has shrunk by 5,000 articles in two days.</p>
<p>▲Silver and Foreign Funds In and Out: "Silver funds" are still subject to the horse racing closure of the bank, and there is no news in the afternoon as usual. In terms of receipts, foreign merchants' drafts were more than 1.7 million, Chinese merchants' more than 2.3 million, exchange receipts more than 900,000, goods receipts more than 2 million, mortgage bills more than 900,000, customs revenue more than 400,000, advances 1 million, foreign funds more than 400,000, miscellaneous receipts more than 3 million, foreign merchants entering the warehouse 300,000, Chinese merchants leaving the warehouse 700,000, Qianzhuang Yinhongdan receipts more than 29 million, silver dividing head receipts more than 3.4 million, various remittance funds more than 500,000, and cash receipts 400,000 to 500,000.

Banknotes were 35,000 in the early market and 15,000 in the afternoon market. Payment slips were 70,000 in the early market and 40,000 in the afternoon market. Bank purchases and sales were 300,000 in the early market and only 300,000 in the afternoon market. Foreign household receipts were more than 1.4 million, banknote inflows and outflows were more than 1.4 million, Qianzhuang Yanggongdan receipts were more than 3.8 million, foreign dividing head receipts were more than 1.3 million, and small Qianzhuang transactions were more than 500,000.</p>
<h3>News After the Long-Term Over</h3>
<p>The financial industry's release of long-term, originally with 40 taels per month, is the only immovable fixed period. The transactions at the end of April this year were so rare that they were no longer a market due to the situation. It was detailed in this newspaper a few days ago, but the outside world is restricted from liquidity adjustment, and it is necessary to try to save it. Therefore, there are many people who try to dredge to the financial community. I heard that it has been approved by the financial community. Yesterday, there were many transactions, and the calculation of six pairs of funds was no less than 600,000 to 700,000. The interest rates were all above 10 taels, and the highest price was 11.5 taels. It is heard that the receivers are all reliable shops in this port, and most of the demands for accommodation from customer gangs have been rejected. In case of face-saving relations, the period is shortened to three pairs of months, and it is estimated that more than 100,000 will also be made.</p>
<h3>Securities and Bond Market Fluctuations, Rising and Falling are Intertwined</h3>
<p>▲Transactions Approximately 3 Million</p>
<p>Yesterday (4th), the Huashang Securities Exchange's various bonds and spot transactions totaled 93,000 yuan, of which the unified tax accounted for 37,000 yuan, and the customs tax and disarmament for 20 volumes each accounted for 10,000 yuan. The futures market was also more idle than before. Major buyers and sellers were all waiting and watching, and the market was particularly deserted. It is estimated that the morning was about 2 million, and the afternoon was only 950,000 yuan, totaling 2.94 million yuan. In addition to the unified salt tax and 20 volumes, etc., each accounted for about 500,000, and the rest was only 100,000 to 200,000 yuan. As for the changes, the retail sales in the market were quite lively in the two sessions in the morning, and the sellers still dominated. The prices continued to fall compared with the previous ones, but the changes were extremely small. In the afternoon market, the sellers did not continue to sell, and the scattered needs in the market were still quite lively. The prices gradually increased as a result, rising by six or seven jiao to one yuan or several jiao compared with the morning. As a result, the disarmament only rose by 2.5 yuan compared with the previous day, the unified tax rose by 1.4 yuan, and the June 19th good deed fell by 2.1 yuan. The rest had ups and downs, and the number was only about half a yuan. Observing the situation of the bond market, due to the chaotic situation, it will temporarily hover without major ups and downs.</p>

<h3>Extremely Pessimistic Yarn Market</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market is still sluggish, and the situation is very weak. Because the situation is still confusing, and the financial flow is still difficult, the transportation on all roads has not yet recovered, making transportation more difficult. As for the economic situation in the interior, it is extremely dry. Therefore, the yarn sales situation is abnormally slow. Wuxi factories have accumulated a lot. It is said that the yarn from the Zhengzhou Yarn Factory is also coming to Shanghai to sell, which shows the pessimism of the yarn market in all directions. It is the unanimous downward stream of people's minds, so the price of standard yarn has fallen step by step, and the recent price has fallen by another two taels.</p>
<p>▲Recent Standard Yarn Fell Another Two Taels: The opening of the standard yarn in the previous market was extremely dispersed. There were very few transactions in the market, and buyers were quite lacking. Each month fell by one tael to one tael, 2.3 mace. The situation in the afternoon was still tired. The opening of the afternoon market was very short, and it ended in only twenty minutes. Each month fell again by 5, 7, 8, and 9 mace. Statistics of the total transactions for the whole day, sold Renfeng 250 bales, Yiyu 400 bales, Zongsheng 300 bales, Tianlong 400 bales, Dachangcheng 400 bales, bought Guangfeng 800 bales, Shenji 200 bales, Changfeng 300 bales, Dafeng 150 bales, Yongda 150 bales. The closing price of the standard is listed on the left,</p>
<p>Standard / Closing / Up or Down / Account Balance</p>
<p>September / 1530 / Down 19 / 15,550</p>
<p>July / 1515 / Down 20 / 11,250</p>
<p>October / 1554 / Down 18 / 17,250</p>
<p>August / 1525 / Down 18 / 15,450</p>
<p>▲Only 271 Bales Sold in Stock: The spot yarn market is very quiet. According to a part of the investigation, the Japanese yarn is secretly very active. It is found that all gangs bought a total of only 271 bales throughout the day. The same industry entered 75 bales, the market fell by 5 mace to 1 tael and 5 mace. The customer gang entered 60 bales in the interior, 25 bales in Guangdong, 50 bales in Jiangxi, 11 bales in Ningbo, 75 bales in Sichuan, 40 bales in Shantou, and 10 bales in the North gang.</p>
<h3>Futures and Spot Cotton Scattered and Miserable</h3>
<p>The cotton market is tired, the situation is very weak, the foreign cotton has fallen a lot and risen a little, the price of yarn has fallen endlessly, the attitude of manufacturers is disappointing, the actual sales are extremely cold, and the factories rarely ask. However, the stock of local cotton is not thick, so the new throwing has not been enthusiastic, the market atmosphere is soft and firm, and the transaction is greatly withered.</p>
<p>▲Zheng Label Dropped by 2 or 3 Mace: The opening of the Zheng label in the previous market of the exchange was fair, and each month fell by 2 mace. The market situation in the afternoon was still soft, and each fell by 5 to 1 cent. The total transaction for the whole day was 5,800 dan, checking the sale of Yifeng 700 dan, Minghua 300 dan, Shenji 300 dan, Xincheng 300 dan, Zhenda 300 dan, buying Yongda 400 dan, Changfeng 400 dan, and Ruida 200 dan.

<p>▲Raw Cotton Factory's Needs Show No Sign of Improvement: The spot cotton transaction is very quiet, and the factories are in a state of depression. It is said that the Shanxi flower factory is offering 31 taels, but it has not yet been concluded.</p>
<h3>Weak Rise in Foreign Cotton</h3>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton's market fluctuated due to Wall Street's slump and short accounts, and the futures rose by 2 to 6 pounds and the spot rose by 5 pounds. British cotton futures rose by 178 points and the spot rose by 4 points. Egyptian cotton rose by 5 points. Indian cotton was closed. The original telegram is recorded on the left, (3rd telegram)</p>

<p>The local Mei'an Cotton Company received a telegram from New York on April 29 saying that there was rain in the southwest. The yarn factory's meeting failed to agree on a method to further reduce production. The yarn and cloth market were disappointing for general trade. The above matters caused the cotton price to rise and fall uncertainly. The progress of the new cotton crop is smooth, and the average estimate of the reduction in cotton fields is 5% to 7%.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Japanese Factories' Spinning Resumption Plan</h3>
<p>The Japanese-owned yarn factories in Shanghai, believing that the situation is gradually calming down, have decided to resume full operations on April 26th after repeated consultations among their trade association. A considerable number of new workers have also been recruited. Approximately 50% of the workers at the factories in Pudong have returned to work, while about 60% of the factories in Puxi have resumed operations. The number of spindles in operation is also around half. As for the yarn counts to be spun, preparations have been made to change the previous direction and spin counts that can be sold currently. Most will focus on 16 counts, with some 32, 40, and 42 counts (small hanks) also being spun. Among the factories, such as Nei Wai Cotton, they will spin 40, 42 (small hanks), and 32 counts. Toyota, Shanghai, and Nitchi will all spin 16 counts. Dong Hua, which previously specialized in 20 counts, will now also switch to 16 counts. Yu Feng will spin 42 counts (small hanks). The reasons for changing the spinning direction are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Sales of 20 and 42 counts (twisted hanks) are currently poor, with large inventories, and the future seems bleak. However, there are no inventories of 16, 32, and 40 counts (small hanks), and there is demand from Dalian, Tianjin, and India. From December last year to March this year, exports have been halted due to the lack of supply. Therefore, upon resumption of operations, efforts must be made to replenish exports, amounting to about 6,000 to 7,000 bales. With 25% of the yarn spindles in operation, sufficient quantities can be sold without stockpiling.</p>
<p>(2) From market observations, the prices of 16 and 20 counts are now almost the same, and 16 counts are sometimes more expensive than 20 counts. Therefore, considering cotton blending costs, 16 counts are considered more profitable.</p>
<p>Here is a classified statistic of Japanese yarn factory looms and ring spindles:</p>
<p>Ring Spindles: 791,290</p>
<p>Looms (wide door/narrow door): 70,811 / 3,327</p>
<p>Total: 74,138 looms</p>
<p>Spindle Count 28 and below: Ring Spindles: 3,049,505 / Mule Spindles: 10,914</p>
<p>Spindle Count Above 28: Ring Spindles: 3,611,611</p>
<p>Up to Spindle Count 60: Mule Spindles: 16,000</p>
<p>Spindle Count Above 60: Ring Spindles: 639,480 / Mule Spindles: 10,080</p>
<p>Total: 7,337,590</p>
<h3>### Silk and Tea: Another Disappointment for Jinhua Silkworm Harvest</h3>
<p>▲ Damaged by Prolonged Rain, Extreme Cold, and Sultry Heat</p>
<p>Jinhua Prefecture's cities and towns are the earliest silkworm farming areas. This year, farmers, learning from the failures of last year's sericulture, and facing economic hardship, have nowhere to borrow silkworm eggs from. Only one or two tenths of the usual number are raising spring silkworms. The early batches have already abandoned leaves during their major molt, and the late batches are already emerging after their third molt. However, continuous cloudy and rainy days, alternating between cold and hot, have caused the silkworms to develop diseases such as jaundice and black vomiting. Six or seven tenths are dying. They should be spinning cocoons soon, but due to unfavorable weather, this year's silkworm harvest is another disappointment.</p>
<h3>### Grain: Stagnant Sales in Pujiang Rice Market</h3>
<p>▲ Southern Shanghai: Yesterday's supply was very limited, and inventories were low. Market sentiment may change. Furthermore, foreign rice merchants continue to sell off, and people's minds are slightly more inclined to buy. However, transactions are slightly more active, and the situation is solid. The price of northern japonica rice has hardened slightly. Those holding inventory are slightly firmer. High-quality Lu Yang long-grain rice is scarce, and the situation has hardened. Early and late rice arrivals are evenly matched, and the market is neither up nor down.</p>
<p>▲ Northern Shanghai: Yesterday's rice situation in northern Shanghai: 30-40 boats arrived from various areas, mostly from Jiangyin and Wuxi. Retail sales in urban and rural stores were not active. Sales of northern japonica rice were slow, and prices remained unchanged. Only 7-8 boats of thin rice arrived, and customer demand was weak. Sales of local rice were slightly firmer by five cents. Lu Yang long-grain and wharf-origin long-grain rice prices were reduced by ten cents at the opening due to the influence of small-package rice.</p>
<h3>### Foreign Rice Sales Still Strong</h3>
<p>▲ Hubei Merchants Inquiring Slightly</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market: Due to the arrival of new shipments, sentiment has softened. Although merchants from other provinces are interested, they are also taking the opportunity to wait and see before loading, hoping for lower prices. Therefore, only merchants from Hankou bought about 600-700 bags of small-package rice. Merchants from other inland provinces only made slight inquiries. However, local demand is still strong, and they are actively searching for purchases in the market. The market has thus gone from weak to firm. The opening prices were: Small-package rice, 3,000+ bags, priced at $10.025 to $10; Mindi rice, 1,000 bags, priced at $10.057; Small-package brown rice, 200 bags, priced at $9.40; Karachi brown rice, 500 bags, priced at $9.50; Small-package rice, April shipment at 4 taels 8 mace 3 fen and May shipment at 5 taels 0 mace 2 fen, 200 tons each, priced slightly lower than the previous market. However, foreign firms have not yet opened sales and are still engaged in merchant re-lending transactions. A merchant from Jiangxi sold 220 bags of mechanized rice for $12.50, which was also purchased by a local merchant.</p>
<h3>### Weak Customer Demand Leads to Lower Flour Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market saw dull trading and falling prices. Initially, foreign flour fell by a small amount of 3-4 cents, and people expected prices to fall further. Later, due to weak demand from merchants from other provinces, merchants from Southeast Asia stated that because war had broken out there, people were panicking and local telegrams ordered shipments to cease. A portion planned to sell in the market, and buyers waited and watched, and opened lower prices. Army ship-backed present warehouse receipts, which were sold the day before yesterday, and May futures, were sold at two liang and seven and a half fen yesterday, only two liang and six fen and two-five, for one fen and two-five. The May period was two liang and six and a half fen, for one fen.</p>
<h3>### Northern and Southern Goods: Large Dried Longan Supply Running Out</h3>
<p>Quanzhou large dried longan has been lacking lately. An investigation of the inventories of various shops in the market shows that there are less than 200 boxes in total, a truly limited number. According to Quanzhou reports, inventories have already run out. Since the Shanghai Incident occurred, sales have been stagnant. Therefore, all inventories have been allocated to Ningbo for sales. Only sporadic sales are being made here, and prices are slightly lower by one or two taels. However, considering the inventory situation, the future market is unlikely to see large fluctuations.</p>
<h3>### Sugar Market: Brisk Trading in Coarse Sand White Sugar</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market opened with the Sugar Association price quotes. Initially, sellers of Dutch Sugar No. 24 coarse sand white sugar were calling for higher prices, but buying interest was weak, and the two sides were still at a standstill. Later, high-quality goods were traded at 12 taels and 9 qian, so ordinary goods went to 12 taels and 8 qian 5 fen, and Hong Kong goods to 12 taels and 7 qian, If any trades were made, the trend was stable and elegant. No. 20 medium sand white sugar was 12 taels and 5 qian 5 fen, and No. 10 Dutch red sugar was 9 taels and 8 qian 5 fen, but trade was sluggish, and the market was calm. Taikoo Sugar B mark was 16 taels and 2 qian 5 fen, DY mark was 15 taels and 3 qian, HM mark was 13 taels and 7 qian 5 fen. Trading was sporadic, and the market showed signs of stability.</p>
<h3>### Dimmed and Colored Worsted Cloth Sales Plummet</h3>
<p>Dimmed and colored worsted cloth is a popular summer wool fabric. However, its sales have been sluggish this year. Aside from a slight increase in inquiries from Sichuan merchants last week, there are few inquiries from other regions. Furthermore, its sales in this market have become a thing of the past. Even the blue dimmed color, which was previously the most popular, now sees no transactions. At this time of commercial hardship, its price has been greatly reduced, but it is still not easy to sell. Yesterday, top-grade dimmed worsted cloth was being offered at a wholesale price of only 3 taels and 6 qian per yard, ordinary goods were being called 3 taels 1-2 qian, and single-sided cloth was 2 taels 5-6 qian.</p>
<h3>### Metals: Tianjin Merchants Frenziedly Buying Tinplate</h3>
<p>Recent tinplate transactions have been very active. Egg factories, canneries, and tobacco companies have successively bought, so transactions have been exceptionally lively. Furthermore, Tianjin merchants and others have emerged as a dark horse, buying frenziedly yesterday. Therefore, a large amount of goods were opened for sale, and prices have soared as a result. Currently, English goods are selling for 10 taels for 90 pounds and 11 taels and 7 qian 5 fen for 100 pounds. American goods are selling for 13 taels for 90 pounds and 14 taels and 2 qian 5 fen for 100 pounds. It is said that a total of 4,000-5,000 boxes have been sold in recent days. Incoming goods are not plentiful, leading to solid confidence, and the future market standard has a great hope of improving again.</p>
<h3>### Decreasing Actual Transactions of French Wire Nails</h3>
<p>Recent metal transactions, apart from some colored goods that have seen some increase in deals, large bulk trades are still completely absent. This is because the deadline for major settlements is approaching and the silver market emergency is influential. Therefore, in order to achieve the fundamental development of metals, I am afraid that it will be difficult to become lively before the end of this month. Although French wire nails have been praised as popular, recently sales are declining due to the limited number of buyers and the market situation has begun to wane, with a standard trend of going downhill step by step. Currently valued at 8 taels, a decrease of money from the previous market, and for large orders, the price is said to be even cheaper.</p>
<h3>### Investigation: Shanghai Cost of Living Index for April of the 21st Year</h3>
<p>The National Tariff Commission recently released a Shanghai cost of living index, stating that the index for April of the 21st year compiled by the commission was 117.2, a sharp drop of 7.9% from the previous month and a decrease of 3.4% from the same month last year.

<h3>An Chang-ho Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Yan Yi</p>
<p>The An family is a large Korean surname. Their relationship to the nation is especially important. Many in the clan are men of ambition. Previously, An Jung-geun assassinated Ito Hirobumi. This earth-shattering act spread his name across the globe. The An Chang-ho who was recently arrested is said to be a paternal uncle of An Jung-geun. He created the New People's Society, plotting to restore national sovereignty. His ambition is no less than that of An Jung-geun. It is said that An Chang-ho, in his youth, was hardworking and self-disciplined. In addition to studying, he constantly practiced martial arts, forging his body. In the beginning, the New People's Society had only a few dozen comrades. Once, on a snowy day, he invited his peers to run barefoot in the valleys. They also set fire to hunt in the mountains, shooting fierce beasts. He referred to the beasts as Japanese invaders, calling the large ones "Great Japanese" and the small ones "Little Japanese." Sometimes, after capturing a beast, he would draw his knife, stab it to draw blood, and pour liquor to drink together. They would sing Yue Fei's "Manjianghong" lyrics in unison, saying: "With fierce ambition, I will eat the flesh of the barbarian invaders when hungry; laughing, I will drink the blood of the Xiongnu when thirsty." After singing, they would laugh loudly and clap their hands, the sound of their applause like thunder, shaking the valleys. The scene was extremely tragic and exhilarating. At other times, they would look up to the sky and weep bitterly, lying prone among the fallen leaves and messy grass. Their patriotic sincerity and hot blood were spurting forth. It is no wonder he was able to attract a generation of young men of ambition. This was told to me a few years ago by my classmate Mr. Huo, who said that his maternal uncle, a certain Mr., went to Korea to study Japanese education and met people from their party, who described Mr. An in general terms like this.</p>
<h3>Today is Japanese Boys' Day</h3>
<p>— Ms. Ye Hua</p>
<p>Japan is both a new nation and an old nation. That which is new is extremely new, and that which is old is extremely old. Holding Children's Day is a product of the new nation. However, commemorating boys and girls separately is an act of the old society. Girls' Day is set on March 3rd, focusing on training for good wives and mothers. Today (May 5th) is Boys' Day, which does not shed its militaristic color. The following is a summary for reference. On this day, children across the country hang up the weapons and armor they play with on weekdays, decorated with war flags on top and offerings of rice wine and sweet flag below, symbolizing the path of courage, martial prowess, and progress. Every household erects a bamboo pole on the land where the child was born, with large colored paper carp hanging from the top. The wind blows the fish, causing its fins and tail to flutter, as if swimming, resisting the rushing currents and leaping over waterfalls, signifying that young people should overcome obstacles and break through difficulties, striving for the highest good. The war god "Martial Saint" is most revered on this day. Imitating war is an important game. Each child often represents the two major competing clans of feudal times, with red and white flags inserted in their backs and helmets on their heads. The helmets are filled with tiles, pottery, and cans. The small soldiers line up in formations to attack and defend, each wielding bamboo swords to gallop across the battlefield. Those who capture the most flags and break the most enemy cans are declared the winners. Shops are filled with toys of soldiers, heroes, generals, warriors, ancient heroes, helmets, bows and arrows, swords, spears, iron armor, and modern new-style military weapons, selling them at low prices. In the evening, the young friends gather to hold banquets. After the meal, they take a hot bath with several pieces of white sweet flag floating in the water. This type of sweet flag is customarily used to ward off the evil spirits (Oni) that devour children. Children also wear sweet flag around their heads, with the sweet flag roots protruding from their foreheads like two horns, also for this reason. The rice cakes eaten in families are covered with green leaves, intending to wish for good health.</p>

<h3>Sword Sharpening Records</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>▲ Xiang Qiang</p>
<p>Xiang Qiang was a native of Dahu Mountain. From a young age, he had extraordinary strength. He enjoyed practicing martial arts. He had the wild energy of a runaway bull, and the villagers could not catch up with him. He happened to encounter Xiang Qiang, who grasped the edge of his robes and stepped forward. With both hands, he grabbed the bull's horns. The bull was startled and could not break free. He then tied it up and brought it back. From then on, his name for magical power greatly increased. His father believed that while Xiang Qiang was brave, he only possessed brute force and did not understand martial arts. He wanted to cultivate him. Just then, a famous teacher, Yuan Yifei, came from the capital. Xiang's father respectfully kept him at home and ordered his son to seek his advice. Who knew that Xiang Qiang, young and vigorous, looked down on everything and refused to acknowledge him as his master. He abruptly said to Yuan, "Can you withstand my fist?" Yuan laughed and said, "In ancient times, there was a 'stubborn neck' magistrate. Now there is a 'stubborn neck' disciple. Xiang Qiang's stubbornness is truly well-deserved." He then took off his clothes and stood upright, saying, "Please test your fist, young sir." Xiang Qiang immediately leaped forward and struck with a fierce fist. Who knew that when the fist struck Yuan's chest, it felt as soft as discarded cotton. It could not hurt him in the slightest. Unconvinced, he swung his fist again. Yuan slightly raised his hand, and Xiang Qiang had already fallen more than ten feet away. Just as he was about to fall to the ground, Yuan suddenly grabbed him by the hand and said, "Stop." He was thus prevented from falling. Thereupon, Xiang Qiang submitted and was willing to perform the rites of a disciple. He followed Yuan to learn martial arts. Yuan loved his courage and therefore kept him at his home to teach him. After more than a year, Xiang Qiang had learned most of Yuan's techniques. He was no longer the brute he had been. Yuan then departed. Xiang Qiang, possessing profound martial arts, then trained the militia to take on the responsibility of protecting his homeland. This was because eastern Liaoning suffered greatly from the constant threat of arson and robbery by bandits. After Xiang Qiang trained the militia, he smashed a large group of bandits, earning him a great reputation. During the Sino-Japanese War, Zuo Baogui died in battle in Pyongyang, and Nie Shicheng defended Motianling with an isolated army. He was able to win against the enemy with a small force, and they became wary. Xiang Qiang heard of this, and he waved his sleeve and rose, saying, "Heaven gave me a body of bronze muscles and iron bones. I should go to the battlefield and perform great feats. Wielding my ten thousand horizontal grinding sword, I will not rest until I have killed all the Japanese invaders." That day, he took up his sword and went to join Nie's army. However, before long, the Treaty of Shimonoseki was concluded, and Nie also led his troops back. Xiang Qiang still followed Nie. Later, during the Boxer Rebellion, Nie Shicheng died in battle in Tianjin. It is said that Xiang Qiang also died at that time.</p>
<h3>Romance of Martial Towers</h3>
<p>— Master of Seeking Happiness Studio</p>
<p>Chapter Six: Pitifully Forced into an Under-the-Bed Alliance in a Night of Shared Dreams; Still Remembers the Initial Encounter, Breaking the Window Promise</p>
<p>It is said that An Yutian, as if riding the clouds and driving the fog, stumbled into a gentle village. This village seemed mysteriously indescribable, certainly not found in the real world, but rather constructed in a kind of peach-colored cloud, forming a separate world of utmost bliss. This world sometimes felt extremely small, crystallized and squeezed onto a small copper bed wrapped in brocade embroidery, soft and warm, filled with jade-like softness and fragrant warmth. However, at other times, it suddenly expanded greatly from the fermenting brain cells, large enough to encompass the universe, spanning the six directions, transforming into a kind of boundless and inconceivable vastness. It could allow his entire soul to freely soar within, without a single place or time not soaked in the most nourishing jade dew and sweet nectar, intoxicated, obtaining the extraordinary bliss of the immortals. If he wandered in the void and wearied of returning, he would dislike the emptiness of the illusory scene and immediately return to the fragrant quilt on the small copper bed, seeking substantial enjoyment. Then emptiness is form, and encompasses the myriad forms of the world, with jade bodies lying in repose, mandarin ducks embracing, the clever trilling of oriole tongues, the lotus buds opening in pairs, the steaming fragrance of milk, the rich fragrance of flesh, the dazzling star-like eyes, and the murmuring of laughter. Everything that the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind can perceive, sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touch, and thoughts, was enough to melt his essence and enchant his soul, allowing him to enjoy the most exquisite pleasure he had never experienced in his life. And unknowingly, a very large amount of time was consumed. By the time the spring dream initially returned and the colorful clouds suddenly gathered, tender voices softly sighed, and weary eyes were slightly fatigued, the pair entered a state of stillness. Many unspoken sentiments of deep affection were frequently conveyed through embraces while lying side by side on the pillow, silent and tacit, truly beyond words and containing subtle mysteries. It's just that An Yutian was ultimately a person who had experienced hardship, and the rest of his life was bleak. He was worried about not finding a way out. But he did not expect that this most wonderful stroke of luck would fly unexpectedly, and he had personally received the favor of a beauty. At this time, gathering his thoughts and quietly pondering, stealing a glance, he only felt confused and unable to express what evening it was, what kind of fate it was. How could such a wonderful person like a heavenly fairy throw herself into the arms of this extremely unfortunate and poor man? Although the affinity was certainly gratifying, by comparison, he felt ashamed and uneasy, ultimately blaming himself for being excessive and overstepping his bounds. However, the mistake had already been made. Who could lightly dismiss this affection? If he wanted to make amends or make longer-term plans, he would have to work harder himself to resolve the difficult restraints he faced.</p>

<p>Supplement of Local News of Shen Bao</p>
<p>Thursday, May 5th, Year 21 of the Republic of China (No Additional Charge) Please Pay Attention to the Following When Purchasing Shun Feng Brand Socks</p>
<h3>Regent's Concubine</h3>
<p>— Jin</p>
<p>Yesterday I saw in the newspaper that a certain charity in Tokyo, Japan, sent a letter to Zhao Xinbo, asking him to raise funds. Zhao then obtained thousands of yuan from Puyi's wife and replied that he was obeying the "Regent's Concubine's order" to donate a certain amount to your group. Zhao apparently compared the position of the puppet regent to that of a Japanese prince, so he called his wife a concubine. This letter was published in the local newspaper and seen by Puyi's wife, who was greatly enraged, thinking that calling her a concubine was to recognize her position as a concubine. She summoned Zhao and questioned him face to face, but the matter ended after someone explained it.</p>
<p>This ugly history has no value for discussion, but the titles of empress and concubine were originally inherited from the despotic monarchs. Puyi's wife is not satisfied with being called a concubine and naturally wants to be called an empress. However, since Puyi is called a regent, his wife should not be called an empress, nor should she be called a concubine, but only a mistress. And why is there so much courtesy for a foreign charity? You gang of foxes and dogs should maintain the dignity of your puppet monarch, and call her empress if you want, and call her mistress if you want.</p>
<p>Zhao Xinbo once said to Zheng Xiaoxu, "You must know that our Manchuria is a young master's country. There are old masters in charge of the seven things when you open the door, and there is no need to take care of them yourself." Since Zhao said it was a young master's country, there must also be an old master's country. The young master naturally calls the old master father, but if the young master's country is to the old master's country, there will inevitably be a distinction between monarch and subject, and naturally they must call themselves subjects and concubines.</p>
<p>When the ministers of the Qing Dynasty had an audience with the emperor, they called themselves slaves. Therefore, there was once a joke. A certain minister had an audience with Emperor Guangxu, because the minister had read too many unofficial histories, and in novels, women often called themselves "slave girl." The minister blurted out and also called himself "slave girl" to Emperor Guangxu. At that time, Guangxu almost laughed out loud, and he had to press his fingers against his head, and his fingers even turned purple, to avoid laughing out loud, but Guangxu did not investigate deeply, which was already a great favor.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the puppet Manchuria, I have not seen any imperial edict from the young master's country to the old master's country. I don't know whether to call them slaves or vassals? One day, when the young master goes to have an audience with the old master, he might accidentally call himself "slave girl"!</p>

<p>Smiling happily after seeing the peach blossoms, turning one's head towards Longhua with lingering sorrow, considered a veteran based on contributions, and signing as a scholar as a gift, refusing to persuade the surrender of the city as a top strategy, and often repenting of the disaster from a wall-facing position, the monk at home is more bitter than one who has left home, going and coming to the drums to answer and take office.</p>

<h3>Simple Small Printing Machine</h3>
<p>— Gong</p>
<p>The oil printing machines we used in the past were mostly imported goods. After the September 18th Incident and the January 28th Incident, we thought in our conscience that it was no longer acceptable to buy them. Therefore, we have now come up with a small printing machine to replace them. The printing machine I am talking about now is extremely small, but it is very suitable and economical for our usual needs of printing only dozens of sheets. Now I will write down the method of manufacturing it below:</p>
<p>First, take ten taels of straight jelly (Gelatine), which is pure glue, soak it in cold water and leave it overnight to allow it to expand. In the morning, mix it with sixty taels of glycerin (seventy taels in winter) in an evaporating dish. Then add a small amount of table salt and heat it to warm it, allowing it to dissolve completely in the water. Be careful to stir it at this time. When there are no more bubbles, you can add a few drops of clove oil (Colveoil) to prevent it from naturally decomposing. Then pour this solution into a flat lead plate and let it solidify naturally. In this way, the printing machine is made successfully. The ink used on this machine can be made yourself as follows:</p>
<p>First, dissolve one tael of aniline violet in ten taels of warm water. After it cools, add one tael of alcohol, four taels of glycerin, and a few drops of edol and carbolic acid. In this way, black ink is made. If you want purple ink, you can dissolve one tael of aniline violet in seven taels of hot water. All other materials are the same. Only the amount of glycerin should be reduced by two taels. It can be done in the same way.</p>
<p>Usage: Write with ink on smooth paper. After it dries, place it face down on the machine. Rub it with your finger two or three times. After a few minutes, peel it off from one end. At this time, the handwriting will remain on the machine. Cover the machine with white paper and rub it several times, then peel it off. The white paper will have the same handwriting. With this printing method, the black ink can print forty or fifty sheets, and the purple ink can print seventy or eighty sheets. After use, wipe the machine with a sponge soaked in hot water. The handwriting on the machine surface will immediately come off, and it can be used again in the same way next time.</p>

<h3>Random Thoughts in a Barber Shop</h3>
<p>— 𢽾 Factory</p>
<p>"Hearing that heads must be shaved, everyone shaves their heads, any head can be shaved, no shaving means no head, shaving is up to him to shave, the head is still my head, please look at the shaver, he also has his head shaved,"</p>
<p>Yesterday I went to the barber shop to "shave my head." While quietly getting my face shaved, I thought of this famous poem. Suddenly, I thought of domestic politics and the recently brewing issue of postal rate increases. This made me go from fear to a deeper level of feeling some emotions.</p>
<p>The barber is truly an authority figure. Once a person enters the barber shop, I am in charge today, so I can only be subject to the authority figure's command and cannot offend the authority figure. The more I think about it, the more dangerous it is. I am terrified in my heart, but at the same time, I dare not show my timidity or leave the range of the razor, lest I make a joke of having half my face shaved and half my face not shaved. Although I am anxious in my heart, there is nothing I can do except wait quietly for the razor to arrive, scraping horizontally and planing vertically. I thought about other issues for a while, and I came to a conclusion: It is best not to be a person.</p>

<h3>Young Master Class</h3>
<p>— Sun Guliang</p>
<p>In this time of national mobilization and united resistance against aggression, we sense that in the heart of society, there still exists a force, leisurely indulging in arrogance, vanity, and conceit, neither self-aware nor being propelled into action.</p>
<p>This force is the general young master class! The daily work of these young masters is polishing their leather shoes, stiffening their collars, powdering their faces, gelling their hair, and when they start discussing things, they are so eloquent that people are left utterly bewildered! When they walk, they look up and stride with self-satisfaction, while also glancing forward and backward, fearing that their clothes might be wrinkled, diminishing their degree of elegance... Alas! This kind of phenomenon seems so out of sync with the national situation of broken rivers and mountains! We sincerely hope that the general young masters, who also share the fate of the nation, will turn around, immediately join the national crisis efforts, and move towards the goal of national mobilization and united resistance against aggression. Only then will they be worthy of being descendants of the Yellow Emperor!</p>

<h3>Lord Guan</h3>
<p>— Yu Xian</p>
<p>A certain village, seventy li away from Shanghai, was designated as the second line of defense in the war. In the quiet midnight, the sound of artillery fire from the fierce battle in Shanghai could be heard, so the slightly wealthier families all evacuated to safe places. On the street, the first thing two people would talk about when they met was predictions about the war. Teahouses and restaurants were of course the main base for discussions. In this kind of disturbing situation, rumors spread that Lord Guan from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms was helping in the battle in Shanghai.</p>
<p>In the afternoon when the rumor started, the entire village gathered at the Jingtu Bridge, vying to ask Lord Guan to protect the lives and property of their whole village.</p>
<p>Lord Guan sat quietly in the niche, neither smiling nor moving, hearing the unanimous cry of Lord Guan! Lord Guan! Lord Guan is furious.</p>
<p>Lord Guan possessed a child and said:</p>
<p>Since I sat here, no one, not even a ghost, has belonged to me. What are you here for today? I don't know about the war between China and Japan, and besides, it's no longer the era of a lone horse and single sword. I can't protect you. You should ask your government for help.</p>
<p>Three days later, the masses clamored that Lord Guan had possessed the child, demanding three thousand pairs of straw sandals, saying that the spirit soldiers couldn't walk on the roads of Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Sketches, Part One</h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>Commodified Monks</p>
<p>For Madam Liu's underworld birthday celebration, Mr. Qi, the accountant, had to make a serious trip to the Shanghai branch of the Hangzhou XX Temple on XX Road. Before even approaching the temple gate, he could see from afar the faded red walls, painted with large, two-foot-square black characters, as eye-catching as "pawnshop" or "official soy sauce." Besides the "signboard," there was also a telephone number, XXXXX, written on it. He thought, "If I had known there was a telephone here, it would have been much more convenient to make a call."</p>
<p>Stepping into the temple gate, a fifty-nine-year-old monk greeted him with a smiling face, chanting "Amitabha!" with folded hands.</p>
<p>"The day after tomorrow is the sixtieth underworld birthday of the Liu family's matriarch, we need to trouble you." Mr. Qi explained his purpose.</p>
<p>"Amitabha! I wonder how many people are needed?" This was the host's smiling response.</p>
<p>"Sixteen people should be enough. May I ask how much per person?"</p>
<p>"Ah! We are not like other places. We are dispatched from the Hangzhou XX Temple. For example, we are very serious in our work. We will chant exactly the number of scriptures we agree on, and we will never be lazy. Moreover, our 'outfits' are all brand new. If it's a grand funeral, it's definitely very dignified..."</p>
<p>"Humph!" Mr. Qi interrupted, "Yes, I know that. You have a lot of people here, and the outfits are very impressive, otherwise I wouldn't have bothered to come."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes! The benefactor is very understanding. Like last year, when Old Madam Song X's funeral was held, we were the ones who went. Ma Road on XX Road, the Shi mansion on XX Road, which wealthy family hasn't we been to? Haha!"</p>
<p>Mr. Qi responded while looking around, and after a burst of laughter, he admiringly said:</p>
<p>"The decorations in your temple are very good."</p>
<p>"It's nothing, it's just barely passable. I'm thinking of putting up an electric sign at the entrance, just like the 'Namo Amitabha Buddha' on Nanjing Road, but I hear it's very expensive."</p>
<p>"Ah! Yes, yes! Everything is expensive now." This was Mr. Qi's sigh. Then he remembered that he hadn't gotten to the main topic yet, so he reminded:</p>
<p>"So, how much is it really per person?"</p>
<p>"To be honest, benefactor, we charge five yuan per person."</p>
<p>"What? Too expensive, too expensive!"</p>
<p>"Then what price do you suggest, sir? Our expenses are really high. You know, it's not easy to make a living in Shanghai."</p>
<p>"I think at most two yuan per person." This was Mr. Chen's counter-offer.</p>
<p>"Sir! To be fair, four yuan per person."</p>
<p>Mr. Qi still couldn't reach that price, so he started walking towards the door.</p>
<p>"At most three yuan, how about it?" Mr. Qi said again as he approached the door. He thought to himself, "There are plenty of temples." But the monk didn't answer in the end, so he stepped out the door. A dozen steps later, he heard the monk's call:</p>
<p>"Come back, come back! Just so-so, let's say three yuan!"</p>
<p>So Mr. Qi had to turn back. Their deal was done.</p>

<h3>The Moving and Heartbreaking "Broken-Hearted Flower"</h3>
<p>The ethical epic "Broken-Hearted Flower," opening today at the Cathay Grand Theatre, was originally a famous stage play known to every woman and child in the United States. It was then adapted into a sound film by the Metro Company, which hired stage queen Helen Hayes for a hefty sum to star in it, and was assisted by veteran actors such as Lewis Stone. Thus, a perfect combination was formed, resulting in a world-class work. The plot briefly tells the story of a weak woman who is initially ill-matched with a man and abandoned midway. The woman must make a living and raise a young child, so she reluctantly becomes a widow again. Unexpectedly, the second man she meets is also a bandit. The woman is implicated and suffers imprisonment. After being released from prison, her child has gradually grown up and is currently being raised in an orphanage. The woman cannot bear to let her child suffer the pain she has endured, so she destroys her beloved child's future. Therefore, although she meets her beloved child, she refuses to admit that she is his birth mother. She is willing to sacrifice her looks and plan for money to help her child become famous. As a result, her beloved child is fortunate enough to achieve fame, but the woman is already haggard and exhausted. The sadness of the plot and the depth of the performance will move even the most stone-hearted person to tears.</p>
<h3>"The Rogue Song" Opens in Paris</h3>
<p>"The Rogue Song", starring Jeannette MacDonald of "The Love Parade" fame, opens today at the Paris Theatre. Since MacDonald emerged from "The Love Parade", her reputation has soared. This play is especially her most successful work, featuring several love songs that sound like a yellow oriole singing from the valley, like pearls rolling on a jade plate, captivating the hearts of listeners. The play also features incredible ice mountain scenes, an Arctic exploration by airship, and scenes of accidentally hitting an iceberg, which are particularly thrilling. The supporting actor, Joe Brown, is an excellent comedian. There are many jokes in the play, and pairing him with Jeannette makes them feel like a peony and green leaves, complementing each other. Men and women in love should see it first.</p>
