<h2>Page 1</h2>
<p>時評</p>
<h3>敬告辦理救濟戰地難民機關　彬</h3>
<p>自上海禍變爆發以來。一般慈善機關與熱心公益之人士。紛紛自起而組設救濟戰地難民機關。致力於被砲火所迫害或驅逐之戰地難民之收容與救濟。此誠爲極其高尙之行爲。足以令吾人深致欽敬。</p>
<p>獨是就此十數日來各機關工作情形而論。則吾人有未能已於言者。第一。吾人認爲力量宜集中。不宜分散。今日上海辦理救濟戰地難民之機關。有上海戰區難民臨時救濟會。有上海市民地方維持會救濟股。有中國濟生會。有中國紅十字會。紅卍字會。上海基督敎戰區難民救濟會。以及大學聯救護隊。市童子軍戰地服務團與各同鄉會等。機關林立。不勝數計。與從前之救濟水災。情形相同。力旣分散。收效自微。同爲救人。何分爾我。何如集中力量。組設一聯合辦事處。分工合作。力旣集中。收效自宏。此其一也。第二。一切工作。應採取科學方法。劃分工作。如總。務調查。供應運輸。衛生會計。交涉等。職權分定。嚴加敦促。俾各盡其職。但求實際。不務虚名。通盤籌劃。普遍救濟。庶幾災民不致遺漏。效率得以增大。此其二也。第三。救出難民。不必專門集中租界。自戰事發動至二月五日止。收容難民人數。據統計已達五萬七千五百三十九人。人數旣多。供應綦難。而且長此麕集。終將束手無以應付。故宜分别遣送內地。使各謀生路。以减少上海之危機。此其三也第四。救濟機關。其性質雖爲臨時。而實際則爲長期。蓋其所救濟者。不僅限於目前之生命。而將來之善後問題。勢必不能忽視。故救濟機關於急救而外。尤宜研究此一大批失業羣衆將來生活之解决辦法。此其四也。上述四者。最關重要。深盼各救濟機關。打破門户之見。斟酌採納。</p>
<p>至於在我一般人民。亦亟應注意兩事。第一。凡業醫與業看護之人士。每日必抽數小時之時間。在後方醫院服務。第二。有財者宜踴躍輸財。無財者宜踴躍輸力。各量其所能。以盡扶困濟危之天職。</p>

<p>本報今晨最後消息、昨晚七時起、日軍用極猛烈之砲火、向我虬江路天通庵路一帶防綫攻擊、一時槍聲機關槍聲密集、敵係威嚇性質、始終未敢衝鋒、我軍沉着應戰、至十二時四十分始止、雙方陣綫未動、又吳淞方面、昨晚八時後、復在薀藻浜之正面、向我砲轟、較閘北之砲戰、稍爲和緩、至夜半始停止、敵亦未曾絲毫得手、據今晨川沙白龍港方面消息、敵艦十七艘、已升火待發、將向吳淞方面出動、預備總攻、</p>
<h3>吳淞昨日戰况</h3>
<p>各處有衝突敵均敗退</p>
<p>日軍造竹筏企圖偷渡</p>
<p>自滬戰發生後、迄今未停、各國領事、曾議定於昨晨請我軍及日方停戰四小時、俾得於此期間、儘量運載戰區難民脫離險境、昨晨閘北方面、日軍果未大舉來犯、惟吳淞方面、自昨晨六時起、又向我軍開始攻擊、在薀藻浜·張華浜·吳淞鎭·砲臺灣·獅子林·等數處、均有衝突、戰爭頗烈、茲將昨日吳淞戰况分誌如下、</p>
<h3>薀藻浜吳淞鎭　昨晨六時日</h3>
<p>方派步兵七八百人、由野戰砲及飛機之掩護、大舉來犯、意圖衝過我方陣線、同時又向該地附近之曹家橋攻擊、我軍之在薀藻浜者祇有二百人弱、均奮勇抵抗、戰約二小時、即將敵擊退、曹家橋方面之蔡廷鍇軍長與外報記者談話情形（李子洋攝）</p>

<h3>砲臺灣張華浜　砲臺灣所泊</h3>
<p>之日艦、共計有十三艘、昨晨日艦上之陸戰隊、時發槍射擊我砲臺旁之軍士、惟因砲臺前泊有英美兩國之軍艦、日軍因有所顧忌、故未敢發砲轟我砲臺、日艦一艘、昨晨駛至張華浜口、約於六時左右、向我方開砲多發、其陸戰隊并擬上岸、均經我駐軍擊退、日軍死傷頗多、</p>
<h3>敵軍預備大舉　大美晚報云、</h3>
<p>今日（十二）午後二時大美晚報訪員在張家浜日軍司令部前、見日兵携軟木竹筏、由持來福槍與機關槍兵士護送、先西進、後再向北趨薀藻浜南之日軍陣線、此項竹筏、乃以壓緊之軟木製成、每方軟木、厚二吋闊約一呎、長三呎、以六方聯成爲一、兩端各置兩方、紮於毛竹、可浮水不沉、兵士携去者、共有百餘筏、司令部前之步兵、來往甚活動、司令部西南面墳塋後安置之陸軍大砲、晨間殊寂静、是時亦隆隆作聲、下午二時後、由楊樹浦飛來飛機六架、連已在天空之三架、共有九架、內轟炸機五架、追逐機四架、觀此情形、日軍對吳淞砲台之攻勢、似即在目前矣、字林報云、昨日午後軍工路運輸子彈之卡車、絡繹不絶、日人所有之各碼頭、卸運子彈軍需、亦甚活動、即野村司令之旗艦上、亦有軍火卸下、曾見有鋼版數車、運向吳淞進發、雙方昨日均乘寂静之機、從事鞏固陣地、聞華兵士氣甚壯、自信可操勝算云、</p>
<h3>敵機轟炸淞鎭　本報記者于</h3>
<p>昨晨九時許、乘車馳往吳淞鎭視察、現雙方陣地、仍無變動、鎭中房屋、大半被砲火所燬、居民遷移一空、十時左右、有敵機飛來兩架、在淞鎭左右、亂擲炸彈、歷時約有一小時、總計抛炸彈二十餘枚、有十餘枚爆發、惟損害尙輕、經我軍高射砲不斷射擊、敵機始飛去、記者遇一鄉人云、今晨（即昨晨）六時至八時許、在紀家橋方面、敵軍約三百餘人、紛向我軍陣綫衝鋒、我軍奮勇抵禦、以機關槍掃射、結果斃敵二百餘人、我方死傷二十餘人、即運往大塲後方醫院、當記者于十一時半離淞時、目睹我軍汽車內滿裝敵軍槍械戰利品、駛向司令部、聞連日來所獲極多云</p>
<h3>寳山縣署暫遷　寳山縣政府</h3>
<p>及財政交通等各機關、因寳山地勢危險、且日艦發砲時、子彈均落於城內、故於昨日起、將縣府及所屬各機關、遷至西鄉羅店辦公、</p>
<h3>閘北昨夜激戰</h3>
<p>白晝日機投彈</p>
<p>黑夜日軍進攻</p>
<p>結果均經擊退</p>
<p>昨日（十二日）閘北方面、自晨間六時起、已無槍砲聲、八時至午十二時、因係四小時停戰救護時期故雙方均入休戰狀態中我軍將士利用時機間有援助避難災民搬運物件及爲之維護出戰區者惟對於進出人民恐有敵人間諜或漢奸混入故防範甚嚴至下午四時後以戰區災民已陸續運出故即宣告戒嚴下午一時後有日機五架在閘北太陽廟飛翔亂擲炸彈至四時起日兵又用大砲向閘北轟擊連續不斷入晚九時激戰更烈茲將各情分誌如次</p>
<h3>日機亂擲炸彈　昨日停戰時</h3>
<p>期過後於下午一時許日飛機五架、又在閘北太陽廟等處天空中發現、先在閘北中興路、共和新路、虬江路等處環繞、繼即投彈、約二十餘起、均在民房附近落地轟炸者六七彈、惟未發火、我軍即用高射砲轟擊、日飛機又飛往太陽廟·潭子灣·麥根路等處投彈、亦爲我軍擊退、惟當時閘北災民正在遷避、因日飛機到處投彈、以致重行搬回者數百人、現皆避在民房內、流離失散不計其數、</p>
<h3>日砲轟燬民房　昨日下午三</h3>
<p>時後、日飛機被我軍用砲擊退後、日兵於下午四時起即改用砲擊、平均每五分鐘一砲、日兵發砲基地、仍在虹口公園內、並間以日兵前哨之鋼砲、均向閘北及麥根路太陽廟一帶民房轟擊、入晚尤密、我軍亦予還擊彈多落於日兵前哨綫、日兵損傷甚衆、閘北民房中彈者無幾皆未爆炸、並探悉日兵於昨日下午二時許、在天通廟車站北面月台、增設防禦物、并在該車站南月台上打椿、加舖鋼板、安設砲位、約有十餘處云、</p>
<h3>入晚又起激戰　雙方砲轟</h3>
<p>至晚九時後、日兵乘機偷襲、乃又發生激戰、接觸地點、在天通庵路、及虬江路、等處、槍聲連續未斷同時雙方均用大砲掩護進攻、機關槍掃射、此起彼接、迫擊砲手溜彈密發、鋼砲亦頻頻施射、聲震全埠、激戰之烈、爲發生戰事後之第三次、至十時後、槍聲漸向東北進移、我軍後方砲隊發砲點、亦進至寳山路口至十一時、槍聲漸稀、間有機關槍聲、係少數日兵殘部、猶思困鬥、惟雙方砲轟仍未輟大都係鋼砲至十二時始稍殺日兵傷亡達二百餘名、我軍傷十餘人、此役、日兵曾屢次向我軍陣地衝鋒均爲我軍殲滅我軍陣綫、一無變動、</p>
<p>逃難旅客搭輪之擁擠（李尊庸　）</p>
<h3>南市防務嚴密</h3>
<p>兵工廠擊退敵飛機</p>
<p>人民多遷入法租界</p>
<p>龍華　昨日下午二時許龍華兵工廠附近天空中、突來日機四架、在該廠四邊、盤旋偵察、意圖擲彈、但我軍對於該處防務、頗爲重視、兵工廠附近、均築有極鞏固之防禦工程、並設有高射砲多尊、以防日機之來襲擊、故昨日日機飛來後、即經我軍開砲轟擊、日機鑒於我方防衛嚴密、無法可施、當即開足速率、飛向楊樹浦方面而去</p>
<p>城廂　昨日（十二）日上午南市十六舖及大南門小南門一帶、謠傳日軍將於傍晚時、連同閘北吳淞同時進攻、因之人心愈形恐慌居民商店、均紛紛遷避租界、携箱負篋、扶老提幼、滿裝車輛、途爲之塞、午後各馬路尤爲擁擠、駐防沿浦一帶警士及保衛團員於下午三時許、因便利佈防起見、將停泊沿浦各處之各項大小船隻、一律令行開往他處、不得再行停泊岸畔、所有各要隘口、亦均加置防禦物、佈置萬分嚴密、於是華界南市各處、五時甫過、即提早戒嚴斷絶交通、</p>
<p>法租界　昨日閘北停戰四小時、而南市方面、因見報載日領之通告、又若大難臨頭、搬入租界、甚至靠近法租界外灘住户、亦有向西搬家者、法當道深恐一旦發生危險沿民國路等一帶各鐵門力量單薄於昨日起、僱工在各鐵門內、加打木椿、佈以鐵網、以厚防禦實力、租界當局、又見紛亂情狀立將鐵栅關閉、因之一般無路可入、咸由十六舖喚渡在外灘上岸、一時法大馬路又成擁擠熱鬧市塲</p>
<p>、惟商户閉門行人疾馳、比較平時、恐怖更多、八仙橋已置有臨時砲堞前停於該處唐克車一輛、現已駛至法領館前保護</p>
<p>南車站　昨日南車站方面、突然形勢嚴重、該路客車、仍開三班因赴杭乘客較前昨兩日更多、故於下午四時、特開臨時客專車一班、共計乘客五千餘人、該站全日售出票欵九千六百餘元、周站長恐今日乘客或再更多、特電請嘉興站車輛科、設法騰出空車多輛運滬以便載客赴杭、外傳今日開杭客車停止之說、全屬誤傳、</p>

<p>昔日之多、祗一人尙持望遠鏡、倚望台欄杆偵視往來車輛如是遵中山路行可五分鐘、抵小木橋、時橋窄人多、且所有車輛均滿載難民汽車、自雇者均裝載箱　物件堵塞東西、竟難通行、記者在該處直俟至東來車輛駛完、然後前進、經中山路·滬太路·沿途祗見貧苦難民、察其情狀</p>
<p>似已暈迷不辨方向、且又因窮困、難雇街車、肩挑擔負、惟以行人往來較多、魚貫逃生、慘哉戰禍、旋至中興路·會文路口行人已少計時已在十一點三刻相距停戰、已將屆滿、蓋以該處離火線更近是以記者亦即舍車步行、見兩旁舖户玻窗無一完整、又以彈痕縱橫、寂静無聲、多以門板舖板碰釘於外、大小棺柩、遺棄路旁約數十具、諒係無辜之遭難者、滿目慘凉、閘北一區恐十年中尤難恢復、會文路口有小飯店舖一所門牌爲五三五、與對面五六六商店、盡被砲彈擊中、椽瓦已不多見、在止園路北角、有石庫門名北萬愼號、雙扉洞閉、靠門牆脚中一砲彈汚泥洒射牆上、儼如落花、中興大戲院幾成彈巢、院前天篷、院後平屋、亦傾倒、嗣聞靠東二零三號</p>
<p>前路中有一未炸炸彈於是再向前進、見彈係從空擲炸深入土中僅留白綠尾翼、翹竪街心、估量在七十五磅以上、旁有木板一方、上書粉字大意係囑行人留意、記者回顧光裕里房屋、尙屬完好、靠西沿鴻興路香山里房屋、前部燬去、後三埭尙保留、仁餘里亦中有數彈、祗毁屋瓦、未遭回祿、記者再欲前進經兵士以危險相阻、遂停進、遠望寶通路損失更甚、除士兵外無行人位於天通庵路·寳山路底之自來水塔、猶岸然高聳似不知砲火槍彈爲何物者至此遂折回</p>

<h3>美報駁斥日人謬論</h3>
<p>不解日本是何心理</p>
<p>字林報云、中央大厦一零二號華興證劵公司接紐約本月十日來電、內稱、查閱美國報紙論調、美報迄今一致駁斥日本所提中國五大埠設立不駐兵區域之議、今日紀事論壇報評論、可以代表美國輿論態度、內有一節云、日本當此時際、建議締一國際公約、以代九國公約大約用武力使中國五大埠成爲中立區域、可謂乖謬之至、誠不能陰解日本官塲是何心理、未知是否由於出人意外之直率、抑以爲西方人士尙不明瞭日本目下在滬地位耶云云、</p>
<h3>日報評論美國態度</h3>
<p>謂爲不即不離</p>
<p>日文每日新聞社云上海事變發生以來、已經十餘日、英美法三國之和平解决提</p>
<h2>Page 2</h2>
<p>議、與其他地方之幾多停戰案、皆歸失敗、但英美法意諸國政府、惟向中日兩國政府、表示戰禍不可及於公共租界與法租界、而我國（日本）外相因圖解决中日兩國間多年懸案、主張中國主要港灣、設立非武裝區域、（即不許中國軍隊駐屯各重要商埠）但美國政府認爲此種提案、不啻分割中國、極端反對至於中日兩國間之懸案解决、與上海設立中立地帶問題、完全不能牽混而言、此種不即不離之美國態度、實堪注目云云、</p>
<h3>中執委會電慰本市人民團體</h3>

<p>大美晚報云、永安第三紗廠被炸案、昨夜（十一）日總領事署發出公報、謂肇禍原因、乃由機關鬆動、致炸彈滑落所致野村少將之參謀長島田曾至美國亞洲艦隊總司令台納提督處道歉謝罪、日總領事村井、亦爲此事、謁見美總領事克銀漢大美晚報云、今晨（十二）十一時薀藻浜濱之永安紗廠、　兆焚如、時適西北風甚烈、故延燒甚速永安二廠之屋、雖有波及之虞但如風不轉向、則尙可保全也、</p>
<p>日方消息彙聞</p>
<h3>日人注意美空中戰</h3>
<p>本埠日文報載東京日聯社電、美國自二月六日、以檀香山爲中心、施行大規模之海軍大演習、特可注目者、攻防兩軍、自四日來以航空戰爲主力、但攻擊艦隊、自四日後至今並未見其影、而沙拉德克·雷克新登·兩航空母艦之飛行機大爲活躍</p>
<h3>野村司令發表豪語</h3>
<p>大陸報云、昨日（十一）下午日海軍司令野村接見各西報記者、茗談片刻、其最後結語聲稱、日軍渡過薀藻浜之日即爲日本在滬軍事行動終止之時、並作豪語、謂日軍自吳淞踏平華軍濠溝之日、爲時不遠、請諸君拭目相觀、屆時即可結束華軍之抵抗云云、當接見之初、諸人進茗後、野村即將預備就緖之宣言、向記者宣述一過說明日軍進攻閘北之原因及日方對付華軍之方案嗣談及轟炸永安紗廠事稱爲不幸之偶然發生事件謂已向美亞洲艦隊司令台納及美陸戰隊司令霍克道歉、並說明炸彈墜落原因、又謂渠抵滬時、即儆戒航空人員勿飛過公共租界天空、記者訽以現仍逐日有日機飛過、則諉謂由於航空人員不明瞭租界界線所致云、</p>
<h3>虹口日便衣隊活動</h3>

<h3>日領滑稽抗議</h3>
<p>日軍用租界爲作戰根據地</p>
<p>反謂我軍子彈落彼大本營</p>
<p>工部局當然不能切實答復</p>
<p>日軍旣已破壞租界中立、作爲戰爭根據地、由此進攻閘北、我軍投鼠忌器、以租界爲本埠精華所萃、爲顧全中外人民生命財產起見、勉自抑制、不向日軍根據地進攻、剷除敵人作戰之大本營、可謂終始保持正義、維護人道者矣、乃據昨日上海各西報發表日當道以有我軍子彈若干顆落在彼作戰大本營之虹口地方、而彼自稱來滬防衛公共租界保護僑民利益之海虹口萬國商團與難民（李尊庸攝）</p>
<p>陸大軍、竟無法應付、特由日總領事致函工部局抗議而工部局復函、措辭則稱、該局地位並非一主權國家、不能有所舉動、以對付任何軍隊、充其量、不過向領袖領事致一抗議文、請其轉達中國當道、但不若請日領事逕向領事團各領事直接抗議、或能較有效力云云、按日總領事村井致工部局函、係六日發出、略謂前數日間、中國軍隊一再轟擊公共租界內虹口地方已有日僑數人中彈死傷如附單所列、未識工部局有何種對付方案、即祈示知爲荷、工部局覆函、係十日發出、略謂工部局知有若干子彈、料想係華軍槍砲放出、落在公共租界之內、但工部局政治地位、旣非獨立國家、亦無國家之主權故其地位對於租界內外各國軍隊行動、不能作武力或外交的直接對付充其量、唯有致抗議書與領袖領事、轉達中國當道、並請有關係各國在滬代表贊助此項抗議而已、但若貴總領事逕向領事團各領事直接抗議、或可較有效力等語、該局同日並將此意函達美總領事兼領袖領事克銀漢、請其迅速致文中國當局云、</p>

<h3>Announcement to Organizations Handling Relief for War Zone Refugees</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai Incident, various charitable organizations and public-spirited individuals have spontaneously organized relief agencies for war zone refugees. They are dedicated to sheltering and assisting refugees forced out or displaced by the artillery fire of war. This is truly a noble act worthy of our deepest respect.</p>
<p>However, based on the work of various organizations over the past ten days or so, there are things we feel compelled to say. First, we believe that efforts should be concentrated, not dispersed. Today in Shanghai, there are numerous organizations involved in relief for war zone refugees, including the Shanghai War Zone Refugee Temporary Relief Committee, the Relief Division of the Shanghai Municipal Local Maintenance Association, the Chinese Relief Society, the Chinese Red Cross, the Red Swastika Society, the Shanghai Christian War Zone Refugee Relief Committee, as well as the University Joint Relief Team, the City Boy Scout War Zone Service Corps, and various hometown associations, among countless others. The situation is similar to the previous flood relief efforts, with fragmented efforts and minimal effectiveness. Since the goal is to save people, why distinguish between "us" and "them"? How about concentrating efforts and establishing a joint office, with division of labor and cooperation? Concentrated efforts would lead to greater efficiency. That is the first point. Second, all work should adopt scientific methods, with clear division of labor, such as general affairs, investigation, supply and transport, sanitation, accounting, and negotiation. Responsibilities should be clearly defined and strictly enforced, so that each person can do their best, focusing on practicality rather than empty formalities. Comprehensive planning and universal relief would ensure that no disaster victims are overlooked and that efficiency is maximized. That is the second point. Third, rescued refugees should not be concentrated solely in the concessions. As of February 5th, the number of refugees taken in since the start of the war had reached 57,539, according to statistics. With such a large number, supplies are difficult to obtain, and continued crowding will eventually become unmanageable. Therefore, it is advisable to send them to the interior, so that they can find a livelihood and reduce the crisis in Shanghai. That is the third point. Fourth, although relief agencies are temporary in nature, they are actually long-term. What is being relieved is not limited to immediate survival, and the subsequent resettlement issues will inevitably require attention. Therefore, in addition to emergency relief, relief agencies should also study solutions for the future livelihoods of this large group of unemployed people. That is the fourth point. The above four points are of utmost importance, and we sincerely hope that the various relief agencies will break down barriers and consider adopting them.</p>
<p>As for the general public, we should also pay attention to two things. First, all medical and nursing professionals should dedicate a few hours each day to serving in rear hospitals. Second, those with financial resources should actively contribute, and those without financial resources should actively contribute their labor. Each should do what they can to fulfill their duty to help those in need.</p>

<p>Japanese Artillery and Bombs Bombard Wusong</p>
<p>Zhabei Ceasefire in the Morning, Intense Fighting at Night</p>

<p>Nanshi Heavily Defended, Safe for Residents</p>
<h3>Latest News This Morning</h3>
<p>Enemy Artillery Bombs Wusong and Zhabei Last Night</p>
<p>Seventeen Enemy Warships Raise Steam and Set Sail</p>
<p>According to the latest news from this newspaper this morning, starting from 7:00 PM last night, the Japanese army launched a fierce artillery attack on our defense line along Qiujiang Road and Tiantong'an Road. A dense sound of gunfire and machine guns filled the air. The enemy's actions were primarily for intimidation, as they never dared to launch a full-scale offensive. Our troops responded calmly, and the fighting ceased at 12:40 AM. The front lines of both sides remained unchanged. Furthermore, in the Wusong area, after 8:00 PM last night, the enemy resumed bombarding our positions on the front lines of the Yunzaobang, which was slightly less intense than the artillery battle in Zhabei, ceasing at midnight. The enemy also did not achieve any success. According to news from Chuansha Bailonggang this morning, seventeen enemy warships have raised steam and are ready to depart, preparing for a general offensive towards Wusong.</p>
<h3>Battle Situation in Wusong Yesterday</h3>
<p>Clashes in Various Locations, Enemy Retreats in All</p>
<p>Japanese Army Constructs Bamboo Rafts, Attempts to Cross Covertly</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, it has not stopped to this day. Consuls from various countries negotiated yesterday morning to request a four-hour ceasefire from both our army and the Japanese side, so that refugees in the war zone could be evacuated during this time. Yesterday morning in the Zhabei area, the Japanese army did not launch a large-scale offensive. However, in the Wusong area, the Japanese army began attacking our troops again from 6:00 AM yesterday. There were clashes in Yunzaobang, Zhanghuabang, Wusong Town, Pao Taiwan, and Shizilin. The war was quite fierce. The battle situation in Wusong yesterday is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Yunzaobang Wusong Town At 6:00 AM Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Japanese side sent seven or eight hundred infantry soldiers, under the cover of field artillery and aircraft, to launch a large-scale offensive, intending to break through our front line. At the same time, they also attacked Caojia Bridge near the area. Our troops in Yunzaobang, numbering only slightly over two hundred, bravely resisted, repulsing the enemy after about two hours of fighting. The Japanese army on the Caojia Bridge front was also defeated by our army. After 9:00 AM, everything was calm, but there were still sporadic gunshots from sentries. In Wusong Town, Japanese soldiers also used artillery to bombard our troops yesterday morning, firing more than thirty rounds, most of which missed. After 9:00 AM, the enemy soldiers continued to shoot at our troops with rifles. A villager in Wusong was wounded in the head and arm by a Japanese artillery shell and has been sent to the Fifth Hospital of the Red Cross for treatment.</p>
<h3>Pao Taiwan Zhanghuabang The Japanese Warships</h3>
<p>Anchored at Pao Taiwan totaled thirteen. Yesterday morning, the marines on the Japanese warships fired at our soldiers near the fortress. However, because British and American warships were anchored in front of the fortress, the Japanese army was wary and did not dare to fire on our fortress. A Japanese warship sailed to the mouth of Zhanghuabang yesterday morning and opened fire on our side around 6:00 AM, firing multiple rounds. Its marines also planned to land, but they were repelled by our garrison. The Japanese army suffered heavy casualties.</p>
<h3>Enemy Army Prepares Large-Scale Offensive The Da Mei Evening News reports,</h3>
<p>"Today (12th) at 2:00 PM, a reporter from the Da Mei Evening News saw Japanese soldiers carrying cork bamboo rafts in front of the Japanese military headquarters in Zhangjiabang, escorted by soldiers holding rifles and machine guns. They first advanced westward, then northward towards the Japanese front line south of Yunzaobang. These bamboo rafts were made of compressed cork, each piece of cork being two inches thick, about one foot wide, and three feet long. Six pieces were joined together to form one, with two pieces placed on each end, tied to bamboo poles, which could float on the water without sinking. Soldiers carried more than a hundred rafts. The infantry in front of the headquarters was very active. The army artillery installed behind the cemetery southwest of the headquarters was silent in the morning, but it was booming at this time. After 2:00 PM, six planes flew from Yangshupu, and with the three already in the sky, there were nine in total, including five bombers and four fighter planes. Judging from this situation, the Japanese army's offensive against the Wusong fort seems to be imminent." The Zi Lin News reports, "Yesterday afternoon, trucks transporting bullets on Jungong Road were constantly moving. The various wharves owned by the Japanese were also very active in unloading bullets and military supplies. Even on Admiral Nomura's flagship, ammunition was unloaded. Several cars of steel plates were seen being transported towards Wusong. Both sides took advantage of the silence yesterday to consolidate their positions. It is heard that the Chinese soldiers have high morale and are confident that they can win."</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Bomb Wusong Town Our reporter went to</h3>
<p>Wusong Town by car yesterday morning at around 9:00 to inspect the situation. There were still no changes in the positions of both sides. Most of the houses in the town were destroyed by artillery fire, and the residents were evacuated. At around 10:00, two enemy planes flew over and dropped bombs randomly around Wusong Town for about an hour, dropping more than twenty bombs in total, more than ten of which exploded, but the damage was light. After our army's anti-aircraft guns fired continuously, the enemy planes flew away. The reporter met a villager who said that from 6:00 AM to 8:00 AM this morning (yesterday morning), about 300 Japanese soldiers launched an offensive against our front line in the Jijiabao area. Our army bravely resisted, using machine guns to sweep them. As a result, more than 200 enemies were killed, and our side suffered more than 20 casualties, who were transported to the rear hospital in Dachang. When the reporter left Wusong at 11:30 AM, he witnessed our army's trucks full of enemy guns and weapons, driving towards the headquarters. It is said that a great deal has been seized in recent days.</p>
<h3>Baoshan County Government Temporarily Relocated The Baoshan County Government</h3>
<p>and various agencies such as finance and transportation, because the terrain of Baoshan is dangerous, and the bullets from Japanese warships all fell within the city, moved the county government and its subordinate agencies to Luodian in the west of the county yesterday for office work.</p>
<h3>Intense Fighting in Zhabei Last Night</h3>
<p>Japanese Planes Drop Bombs During the Day</p>
<p>Japanese Army Attacks at Night</p>
<p>All Resulting in Repulsion</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 12th) in Zhabei, there was no gunfire from 6:00 AM. From 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM, it was a four-hour ceasefire period for rescue purposes, so both sides were in a state of truce. Our soldiers took the opportunity to help disaster victims evacuate and maintain order. However, in order to prevent enemy spies or traitors from infiltrating the evacuating people, precautions were taken very strictly. After 4:00 PM, after the disaster victims in the war zone had been evacuated one after another, martial law was announced. After 1:00 PM, five Japanese planes flew over the Sun Temple in Zhabei and dropped bombs randomly. Starting at 4:00 PM, Japanese soldiers used artillery to bombard Zhabei continuously. The fierce fighting was even more intense at 9:00 PM. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Drop Bombs Randomly After the ceasefire period yesterday</h3>
<p>Afternoon, at around 1:00 PM, five Japanese planes were discovered in the sky over the Sun Temple and other places in Zhabei. They first circled around Zhongxing Road, Gonghe New Road, and Qiujiang Road in Zhabei, and then dropped about twenty bombs, six or seven of which landed and exploded near civilian houses, but did not ignite. Our army immediately used anti-aircraft guns to bombard them. The Japanese planes then flew to the Sun Temple, Tanzi Bay, and Maigen Road to drop bombs, but were also repelled by our army. However, at that time, disaster victims in Zhabei were evacuating, and the Japanese planes dropped bombs everywhere, causing hundreds of people to move back again. Countless numbers have been displaced and lost.</p>
<h3>Japanese Artillery Destroys Civilian Houses After the Japanese planes were repelled by our army</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, starting at 4:00 PM, the Japanese soldiers switched to artillery fire. On average, one shell was fired every five minutes. The Japanese soldiers' artillery base was still in Hongkou Park, and the steel cannons of the Japanese soldiers' outposts were also used to bombard civilian houses in Zhabei and the Maigen Road Sun Temple area. It was even denser at night. Our army also retaliated, with many shells falling on the Japanese soldiers' outpost line. Many Japanese soldiers were injured. Few civilian houses in Zhabei were hit by shells, and none of them exploded. It was also discovered that the Japanese soldiers had added fortifications on the north platform of the Tiantongmiao Railway Station at around 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon, and drove piles and laid steel plates on the south platform of the station to install artillery positions, about a dozen of them.</p>
<h3>Intense Fighting Resumes at Night After both sides shelled each other</h3>
<p>Until 9:00 PM, the Japanese soldiers took the opportunity to launch a sneak attack, and fierce fighting broke out again. The contact points were on Tiantong'an Road and Qiujiang Road, etc. The sound of gunfire continued without interruption. At the same time, both sides used artillery to cover their offensive, machine guns fired, and mortar shells were fired densely. Steel cannons were also frequently fired. The sound shook the entire city. The intensity of the fighting was the third time since the outbreak of the war. After 10:00 PM, the sound of gunfire gradually moved towards the northeast. The firing points of our army's rear artillery troops also advanced to the intersection of Baoshan Road. By 11:00 PM, the sound of gunfire gradually subsided, with sporadic machine gun fire. A few remaining Japanese soldiers were still struggling to fight. However, the artillery shelling of both sides did not stop, mostly steel cannons, and it was not until 12:00 AM that it subsided slightly. The Japanese soldiers suffered about two hundred casualties, and our army suffered more than ten casualties. In this battle, the Japanese soldiers launched several offensives against our army's positions, but were all annihilated by our army. Our army's front line remained unchanged.</p>

<h3>Strict Defense in Nanshi</h3>
<p>Arsenal Repels Enemy Planes</p>
<p>People Mostly Move into the French Concession</p>
<p>Longhua At around 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon, four Japanese planes suddenly appeared in the sky near the Longhua Arsenal, circling and scouting around the factory, intending to drop bombs. However, our army attached great importance to the defense of the area. The areas near the arsenal were built with very solid defense projects, and many anti-aircraft guns were installed to prevent Japanese planes from attacking. Therefore, after the Japanese planes arrived yesterday, our army opened fire and bombarded them. The Japanese planes, seeing that our defense was tight and there was nothing they could do, immediately opened full speed and flew towards Yangshupu.</p>
<p>Chenghuang Yesterday (12th) morning, rumors spread in the Nanshi 16th Pu and Dananmen Xiaonanmen areas that the Japanese army would launch an attack at dusk, along with Zhabei and Wusong at the same time. As a result, people became more and more panicked. Residents and shops moved to the concessions. Carrying boxes and burdens, supporting the old and carrying the young, the vehicles were full and the roads were blocked. The police and members of the security corps stationed along the coast strengthened their defenses at around 3:00 PM. For the sake of convenience in deploying defenses, all large and small ships parked along the coast were ordered to move elsewhere and were not allowed to park on the shore. All key passes were also fortified and defenses were deployed in great detail. As a result, martial law was imposed early in various places in the Chinese city of Nanshi, cutting off traffic.</p>
<p>French Concession Yesterday, Zhabei ceased fire for four hours, and the Nanshi area, seeing the reports of the Japanese consul's announcement, felt as if a great disaster was imminent, and moved into the concessions. Even residents living near the Bund of the French Concession moved west. The French authorities were deeply concerned that once a danger occurred, the iron gates along the Minguo Road and other areas would be weak. From yesterday, workers were hired to drive wooden piles and lay iron nets inside the iron gates to increase the defense. Seeing the chaotic situation, the concession authorities closed the iron gates. As a result, the general public had no way to enter and were all called from the 16th Pu to land on the Bund. For a time, the French Avenue became a crowded and lively market. However, shops were closed and pedestrians rushed by, more terrifying than usual. Temporary fortresses have been placed in the Eight Immortals Bridge. A tanker truck that was parked there has now been driven to the French consulate for protection.</p>
<p>South Railway Station Yesterday, the situation at the South Railway Station suddenly became serious. The passenger cars on the road still ran three shifts. Because there were more passengers going to Hangzhou than in the previous two days, a special temporary passenger car was opened at 4:00 PM, with a total of more than 5,000 passengers. The station sold more than 9,600 yuan worth of tickets throughout the day. Director Zhou was afraid that there would be even more passengers today, so he telegraphed the vehicle department of Jiaxing Station to try to free up more empty cars and transport them to Shanghai to carry passengers to Hangzhou. The rumor that the Hangzhou passenger cars would stop running today is completely false.</p>
<h3>Visit to Wusong Battlefield Interview with Brigade Commander Weng Recounted</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Mrs. Sun Personally Went to Comfort the Troops</p>
<p>The Position Is Solid, the Enemy Will Never Be Able to Prevail</p>
<p>Since changing their strategy, the violent Japanese have used all their strength to attack Wusong, which has lasted for four or five days, but they have not succeeded. In order to understand the actual situation on the front line, the reporter drove to Wusong at 12:00 yesterday. Along the way, passing through Liuhang, Yanghang and other places, I saw that our defenses were extremely solid and complete. During the European war, the reporter had inspected the French soldiers' positions in Verdun, which were no more than that. When I arrived at the Wusong Brigade Headquarters, Brigade Commander Weng happened to be accompanying Mrs. Sun Qingling to comfort the soldiers outside. The reporter asked a staff officer about the battle situation last night. He said that last night, Japanese soldiers built positions on the opposite bank of Yunzaobang, and fired at our side from time to time. After our side bombarded them with mortars, the Japanese soldiers opened fire. However, because our side was familiar with the Japanese military's combat methods, we did not return fire. After they were quiet, we still provoked them with small cannons until dawn. The Japanese army then launched a large-scale attack, numbering about six or seven hundred people. The intensity of the artillery fire was the same as the previous fierce battles. Our soldiers were unusually calm. When they approached, they swept them with machine guns. Less than half of the Japanese soldiers survived. When the day dawned, the Japanese soldiers charged more than ten times, but our position did not move at all. They did not dare to try again and retreated. Our side did not pursue, as if nothing had happened. While we were talking, Brigade Commander Weng had returned to the door and greeted us respectfully, inviting us in. The guest was Mrs. Sun. Mrs. Sun was radiant, smiling and amiable, unlike some who said that Mrs. Sun's face was haggard. Following Mrs. Sun were several of her friends, and Division Commander Qu Shounian. General Qu was very young, but calm and courageous, and full of strategy, also a hero in our military. During the meeting, the reporter was able to listen to Mrs. Sun's remarks. She praised the 19th Route Army unreservedly, and frequently urged Brigade Commander Weng, saying that the brigade commander's contribution to guarding Wusong was extremely great, and hoped that he would continue to fight, so that no inch of our China would fall into the hands of the enemy. At that time, there was a rattling sound in the sky, and enemy planes were scouting and dropping bombs again. The reporter asked Brigade Commander Weng if there was any news he wanted to publish. The brigade commander then said to the reporter, "Please tell the citizens of Shanghai not to worry about Wusong. Not only is our position solid and well-arranged, giving the enemy no chance to cross the thunder pond, but also our soldiers, who always take defending the territory as their responsibility, will never allow the enemy to be rampant. Although the Japanese side is frequently reinforcing troops, intending to expand the war, our side now has very strong forces and high morale, so there is no need to worry about the unexpected. What I hope is that the whole country will be of one mind and share the same hatred for the enemy, so that no enemy can be destroyed." At that time, Japanese planes were still circling around, and Brigade Commander Weng said to the reporter that the enemy warships were about to start shelling, "Why don't you go back and rest?" The reporter shook hands with him again and wished him victory from beginning to end (Silent).</p>
<h3>Japanese Violate International Law</h3>
<p>Take Advantage of the Ceasefire to Rescue Opportunity to Send Plainclothes Teams to Charge Our Chinese Area</p>
<p>Through the initiative of French priests and the mediation of the British Consul General, the Chinese and Japanese military authorities agreed to designate a four-hour ceasefire period from 8:00 AM to 12:00 AM yesterday in the Baoshan Road Baoxing Road Qiujiang Road area. The International Volunteer Corps and various rescue groups were to go to protect disaster victims. However, the cunning Japanese disregarded humanity and violated international law. At 8:00 AM yesterday, when people from all sides went to the war zone to rescue disaster victims, they sent more than a hundred plainclothes teams, disguised as Chinese refugees, hiding weapons, departing from the Huangpu Wharf, renting seven trucks from a car company on Gongping Road, and getting off at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Bazilu. They divided into teams of three or five and charged towards the Chinese areas of Jiangwan and Zhabei, attacking and provoking our Jiangwan garrison. Fortunately, the Jiangwan area was not designated as a ceasefire zone yesterday, so our army was prepared and repelled them at that time.</p>
<h3>Three Thousand Refugees Rescued During Ceasefire Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Charitable Organizations Exert All Efforts to Rescue Those Without Relatives Sent to Various Shelters</p>
<p>From 8:00 AM to 12:00 AM yesterday, the four-hour ceasefire allowed both sides to stop attacking and rescue disaster victims in the Zhabei war zone. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, in conjunction with the Chinese Red Cross, the Shanghai War Zone Refugee Temporary Relief Committee, and other charitable organizations, prepared a large number of trucks to drive to the war zone and rescue no less than three or four thousand refugees. In addition to some who went to their relatives and friends, the rest were sent to safe areas for resettlement. This truce was initiated by Major Peel and various Western priests such as Father Jia Gui, and was agreed upon by both the Chinese and Japanese military authorities. The details are summarized as follows:</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of Zhabei After the War A reporter from the Guowen News Agency yesterday</h3>
<p>Taking advantage of the fact that the war had been initiated by French priests and negotiated by British and American consuls, and that both sides had ceased fire for four hours to rescue disaster victims, I also set off by car at around 9:00 AM. It was originally planned to go to Zhabei via Sanban Bridge, but because of the crowding of refugees, the soldiers stationed at the bridge stopped us and told us to detour east along Fanwangdu. When we arrived at Fanwangdu, we saw sixty or seventy British soldiers, wearing leather vests and carrying guns beside the road, seemingly busy with defense construction. Crossing the railway and turning east along Zhongshan Road, the Japanese soldiers in the Fengtian Spinning Factory were no longer as</p>
<p>Many as before, only one person was holding binoculars, leaning on the railing of the observation platform to scout the passing vehicles. As we traveled along Zhongshan Road for about five minutes, we arrived at Xiaomu Bridge. At that time, the bridge was narrow and crowded, and all the vehicles were full of refugees and cars, filled with boxes and</p>
<p>Items, blocking the east and west, making it difficult to pass. The reporter waited there until the vehicles from the east had finished driving, and then moved forward. Along Zhongshan Road and Hutai Road, we only saw poor refugees, and their situation</p>
<p>Seemed to be dizzy and unable to distinguish directions. Moreover, because they were poor, it was difficult to hire rickshaws. They carried burdens on their shoulders, but because there were more pedestrians coming and going, they were fleeing in a line, how tragic the war. We arrived at the intersection of Zhongxing Road and Huiwen Road, where there were fewer pedestrians, and it was already 11:45, close to the end of the ceasefire. The reason was that the place was closer to the front line, so the reporter also got out of the car and walked. We saw that the glass windows of the shops on both sides were not intact, and there were bullet marks crisscrossing, silent. Most of the doors and planks were nailed to the outside. Dozens of large and small coffins were abandoned on the roadside, probably innocent victims of the disaster. The whole scene was miserable. It will be difficult for the Zhabei area to recover in ten years. There was a small restaurant at the intersection of Huiwen Road, with the door number 535, and the 566 shop opposite was hit by artillery shells, and there were few rafters left. At the north corner of Zhiyuan Road, there was a stone gate named Bei Wan Shen Hao, with both doors closed. A shell hit the foot of the wall by the door, and the mud splashed on the wall, like fallen flowers. The Zhongxing Grand Theater has become a nest of shells, and the front awning and the flat roof in the back of the theater have also collapsed. Later, it was heard that No. 203 East</p>
<p>There was an unexploded bomb in front of the road, so we went forward again and saw that the bomb had been dropped from the air and had penetrated deep into the soil, leaving only the white and green tail wings, standing upright in the center of the street. It was estimated to be over 75 pounds. There was a wooden board on the side, with the words written in chalk, meaning to warn pedestrians to pay attention. The reporter looked back and saw that the houses in Guangyuli were still intact. The houses in Xiangshanli along Hongxing Road to the west were destroyed in the front, and the back three rows were still preserved. There were also several shells in Renyuli, which only destroyed the roofs and did not cause a fire. The reporter wanted to go forward again, but was stopped by the soldiers because it was dangerous, so he stopped. Looking into the distance, the losses on Baotong Road were even greater. Except for the soldiers, there were no pedestrians. The water tower at the end of Tiantong'an Road and Baoshan Road still stood tall and seemed not to know what artillery fire and bullets were. At this point, we turned back.</p>
<h3>Rescuing War Zone Refugees From 8:00 AM yesterday,</h3>

<h3>Refugee Relief Association Shanghai War Zone Temporary Refugee Relief</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the association dispatched 30 ambulances, with four traveling to and from the Sichuan Road Bridge, four to and from the Henan Road Bridge, two to Fujian Road, three to Zhejiang Road, four to Xizang Road, three to Wuzhen Bridge, four to Xinzha Bridge, six to the Sanbanchang Bridge, and three to Caojiadu, rescuing refugees back and forth. All refugees were transported from Zhabei to safe areas and then unloaded. Those with relatives and friends dispersed, while those who were homeless were temporarily gathered and sent to the Renji Shantang, which then transferred them to various refugee shelters for settlement. Later, due to the large number of refugees, the Xinzha Bridge, Wuzhen Road Bridge, and Sanbanchang Bridge gates were closed again. The ambulances then merged into the open routes to facilitate transportation. The Laozha Bridge and the two Garbage Bridges were also opened and closed from time to time to prevent refugees from crowding into the concession at will. The chief leader, Mr. Chen Wenkui, also went to the Gujiazhai of Dachangdian to rescue 73 female workers from the Baoxing Yarn Factory. In total, the number of people rescued by the various vehicles was no less than 1,200, and 582 homeless people were taken in by the association's refugee shelters.</p>
<h3>Chinese Life Saving Society</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the association dispatched rescue team leader Ling Youguang, leading five ambulances, from Hengfeng Road Bridge to various fire lines in Zhabei, rescuing more than 300 people. More than 50 people were also rescued in the area of Shigaota Road.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning, taking advantage of the ceasefire between the two sides, members of each team took 10 cars to dangerous areas such as North Sichuan Road, Qiujiang Road, Guangdong Street, Hengfeng Road Bridge, Zhonghua New Road, and Tiantong'an West Baoxing Road, rescuing a total of more than 1,200 people. In the afternoon, four cars went directly to Luodian and Wusong, rescuing more than 300 people.

<h3>Citizens' United Association</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rescue team of Liu Zhongying, Wang Zhaocheng, Wu Banqiang, Chen Binghui, Yan Renhao, Chen Guangxiang, etc., hired three ambulances and, taking advantage of the ceasefire, went to the Zhabei war zone to rescue affected compatriots from danger. They traveled back and forth a total of nine times, rescuing more than 1,000 affected compatriots. Except for a portion who went to relatives and friends, the rest were sent to the refugee shelters run by the association for settlement. This was not enough, so a refugee shelter was added at the Dingguang Temple on Avenue Edouard VII, bringing the total number established to 12. In addition to the local maintenance committee being responsible for the food supply, all other expenses were covered by donations from the association's members. Also yesterday, Ms. Xu Lianfang and Ms. Ma Mingyun, witnessing the miserable conditions of the refugees in the various shelters, generously donated rice and distributed pocket money to each person. In addition, five children, including Feng Xinbao, saved their New Year's money and bought five dou of white rice to donate, which was especially commendable. The association's temporary office is located at the Huining Fellow Association in Hongxiang Lane on Xinzha Road. People from all walks of life can deliver food and other assistance to the office to be distributed to the refugees in the various shelters.</p>
<h3>Nine Road Businessmen's Association</h3>
<p>Nine Road Businessmen's Association on Avenue Edouard VII.</p>
<p>Members Wu Banqiang, Chen Guangxiang, Zhang Youshui, and others specially prepared three ambulances yesterday morning and went to the war zone to rescue more than 200 women and children in distress. They borrowed Dingguang Temple on the road as a temporary refugee shelter, but it is heard that food and other items are still waiting for donations from all sectors of society.</p>
<h3>Coal Industry Association</h3>
<p>Xie Baoxing and others from the Coal Industry Association opened 13 trucks to the Red Cross Society at 7:00 AM yesterday and went with the leaders of the various rescue teams to rescue hundreds of refugees in the Zhabei area. Their efforts in rescue were truly admirable.</p>
<h3>French Father Forms Another Team</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the request of the French Father, the British Consul General, B. G. Tours, agreed with both the Chinese and Japanese sides to cease hostilities for four hours from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM to rescue refugees in the war zone. A team of 24 people was organized by the French Father, including 16 nurses and one Chinese interpreter. One person each was sent by the Japanese Consul and the Japanese army to accompany them to Hongkou for rescue. They then returned to the Chinese army's defense line in Zhabei and sent the refugees out of the war zone to take the various vehicles of the War Zone Temporary Refugee Relief Association and the Red Cross Society to refugee shelters and other places.</p>
<h3>British and American Ambassadors Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Mediating Peace as Private Individuals Yesterday, Meeting Shigemitsu Aoi to Exchange Views British Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen arrived in Shanghai on the British warship HMS George V, and American Ambassador Johnson arrived on the American warship USS Simpson. French Ambassador Wilden had already arrived the day before yesterday afternoon. The ambassadors of the three countries are here to inspect the current situation in Shanghai and to mediate the Sino-Japanese peace movement as private individuals. They have not received instructions from their governments. Therefore, their initial actions are to solicit the opinions of the Chinese and Japanese authorities. If there is a possibility of rapprochement, they will then mediate; otherwise, they will stop. British Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen met with Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu Aoi at 1:30 PM yesterday. French Ambassador Wilden also met with the Japanese Ambassador at around 2:00 PM. According to information obtained by our reporter, the results of the meeting between the British, French, and Japanese ambassadors were only an exchange of personal views, and there were no concrete plans for the peace issue. The American Ambassador is scheduled to meet with Shigemitsu today to discuss everything. At 4:00 PM yesterday, Mayor Wu, H.H. Kung, Quo Tai-Chi, Chang Shou-yong, Li Fu-sun, and more than a dozen others had an important meeting at T.V. Soong's residence. Soong was also present and did not leave until 6:00 PM. After the meeting, T.V. Soong, Quo Tai-Chi, and Mayor Wu separately visited the British and American ambassadors.</p>
<h3>American Newspaper Refutes Japanese Fallacies</h3>
<p>Not Understanding What the Japanese Are Thinking</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News reported that the Huaxing Securities Company at 102 Central Arcade received a telegram from New York on the 10th of this month, stating that, upon reviewing the editorials in American newspapers, the American newspapers have unanimously refuted the Japanese proposal to establish non-garrisoned zones in China's five major ports. The commentary in the New York Evening Post can represent the attitude of American public opinion. One section reads: "At this juncture, Japan is proposing to conclude an international treaty to replace the Nine-Power Treaty and to use force to make China's five major ports neutral zones. This is extremely absurd. It is truly impossible to understand what the Japanese government is thinking. It is not known whether this is due to unexpected frankness or whether it is thought that Westerners are not yet aware of Japan's current position in Shanghai."</p>
<h3>Japanese Newspaper Comments on American Attitude</h3>
<p>Calling It "Neither Close Nor Distant"</p>
<p>The Japanese-language Mainichi Shimbun reported that it has been more than ten days since the Shanghai Incident occurred. The peace settlement proposals from the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, as well as several other ceasefire proposals, have all failed. However, the governments of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and Italy have only expressed to the Chinese and Japanese governments that the war should not extend to the International Settlement and the French Concession. Our (Japanese) Foreign Minister, in order to resolve the long-standing issues between China and Japan, has proposed the establishment of non-armed zones in major Chinese ports (i.e., Chinese troops are not allowed to garrison in important commercial ports). However, the American government believes that this proposal is tantamount to partitioning China and is extremely opposed. As for the resolution of outstanding issues between China and Japan and the establishment of a neutral zone in Shanghai, these cannot be confused. This "neither close nor distant" American attitude is truly noteworthy.</p>
<h3>CEC Sends Telegram of Condolences to People's Organizations in This City</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Mayor Wu received a telegram from the Central Executive Committee in Luoyang, forwarded to various people's organizations in this city, stating that, this time, the violent Japanese attempted to occupy Shanghai, and thanks to the loyal and brave resistance of our defending soldiers, they have repeatedly deterred the strong enemy. The people from all walks of life have been able to do their best and assist the garrison during the tense military situation. Their enthusiasm and determination are deeply appreciated. It is hoped that they will continue to rise up and jointly maintain the national crisis, which is greatly hoped for.</p>
<h3>Japanese Acknowledge the Sin of Bombing the Wing On Factory</h3>
<p>Apologize to the American Admiral</p>
<p>And Promise Full Compensation</p>
<p>Wusong Factory Burned Down Yesterday</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News reported that after Japanese aircraft bombed the Wing On No. 3 Factory on Mukden Road yesterday (11th), Japanese Navy Commander Rear Admiral Nomura personally paid a formal visit to Admiral Taussig, Commander-in-Chief of the US Asiatic Fleet, to express his deep apology and remorse. He also said that full compensation would be given for the deaths and injuries of Chinese people and the losses of private property. One of Nomura's staff officers was also ordered to go to the scene of the accident to inspect whether the injured had been sent to the hospital for proper treatment.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reported that regarding the bombing of the Wing On No. 3 Yarn Factory, the Japanese Consulate General issued a public statement last night (11th), stating that the cause of the accident was due to a loose mechanism, which caused the bomb to slip. Rear Admiral Nomura's Chief of Staff, Shimada, visited Admiral Taussig, Commander-in-Chief of the US Asiatic Fleet, to apologize. Japanese Consul General Murai also met with American Consul General Cunningham about this matter. The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reported that this morning (12th) at 11:00 AM, the Wing On Yarn Factory in Yunzaobang was completely burned down. At the time, the northwest wind was very strong, so the fire spread very quickly. Although there is a risk that the Wing On No. 2 Factory will be affected, it can still be preserved if the wind does not change direction.</p>
<p>Compilation of Japanese News</p>
<h3>Japanese Pay Attention to American Air Warfare</h3>
<p>This newspaper cited a Tokyo dispatch from the Rengo News Agency, stating that the United States has been conducting large-scale naval exercises centered on Honolulu since February 6. It is particularly noteworthy that the attacking and defending forces have been focusing on air warfare since the 4th. However, the attacking fleet has not been seen since the 4th, while the aircraft of the Saratoga and Lexington aircraft carriers have been very active.</p>
<h3>Commander Nomura Issues Bold Statement</h3>
<p>The China Press reported that yesterday (11th) afternoon, Japanese Navy Commander Nomura met with Western newspaper reporters for a brief chat. His final concluding remarks stated that the day the Japanese army crossed Yunzaobang would be the day the Japanese military operations in Shanghai would end. He also made a bold statement, saying that the day the Japanese army leveled the Chinese army's trenches from Wusong was not far away. He asked everyone to wait and see, and the resistance of the Chinese army would be over at that time. At the beginning of the meeting, after everyone had tea, Nomura read a prepared statement to the reporters, explaining the reasons for the Japanese army's attack on Zhabei and the Japanese plan to deal with the Chinese army. When talking about the bombing of the Wing On Yarn Factory, he called it an unfortunate accidental event, saying that he had apologized to Admiral Taussig, Commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, and Marine Corps Commander Hawke, and explained the reason for the bomb's fall. He also said that when he arrived in Shanghai, he warned the aviation personnel not to fly over the International Settlement. When the reporter asked why Japanese aircraft were still flying over the area every day, he excused it by saying that it was because the aviation personnel did not understand the boundaries of the settlement.</p>
<h3>Japanese Plainclothes Teams Active in Hongkou</h3>
<p>The China Press reported that, according to reports received last night (11th), Japanese plainclothes teams, armed with pistols or other weapons, were very active in the Hongkou area again yesterday. They began searching Chinese people and detaining them on various pretexts, and even preventing the Shanghai Municipal Police from performing their duties.</p>
<h3>Nearly 8,000 Japanese Nationals Have Returned to Japan</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that yesterday (11th), another 400 Japanese nationals returned to Japan on a transport ship. The ship had brought troops to Shanghai a few days ago and returned to Japan empty. The captain voluntarily agreed to carry refugees back to Japan. The ship will stop at Moji along the way and dock at Ujina near Hiroshima. As of today, about 8,000 Japanese nationals have returned to Japan, mostly women and children.</p>
<h3>Ridiculous Protest by Japanese Consul</h3>
<p>The Japanese Army Uses the Settlement as a Base of Operations</p>
<p>Instead, They Claim Our Army's Bullets Fell on Their Headquarters</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Naturally Cannot Give a Concrete Reply</p>
<p>Since the Japanese army has destroyed the neutrality of the Settlement and used it as a base of operations to attack Zhabei, our army, fearing the consequences of hurting the innocent, and in order to protect the lives and property of Chinese and foreigners, has restrained itself and not attacked the Japanese army's base of operations, thus eliminating the enemy's headquarters. It can be said that we have maintained justice and protected humanity from beginning to end. However, according to various Western newspapers in Shanghai yesterday, the Japanese authorities claimed that some bullets from our army fell on their headquarters in Hongkou, and that they, who claimed to have come to Shanghai to defend the International Settlement and protect the interests of overseas Chinese...</p>

<p>... the Hongkou Volunteer Corps and refugees... the Japanese army was unable to cope. The Japanese Consul General sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council to protest, and the Municipal Council replied that the council's position was not that of a sovereign state and could not take any action against any army. At most, it could only send a protest letter to the Senior Consul, asking him to forward it to the Chinese authorities. However, it would be better for the Japanese Consul to protest directly to the consuls of the Consular Body, which might be more effective. According to the letter sent by Japanese Consul General Murai to the Shanghai Municipal Council on the 6th, it stated that in the past few days, Chinese troops had repeatedly shelled the Hongkou area within the International Settlement, causing the death and injury of several Japanese nationals, as listed in the attached list. He asked what kind of countermeasures the Shanghai Municipal Council had and requested to be informed. The Shanghai Municipal Council replied in a letter issued on the 10th, stating that the council knew that some bullets, presumably fired by Chinese troops, had fallen within the International Settlement. However, the political status of the Shanghai Municipal Council was not that of an independent state, nor did it have the sovereignty of a state. Therefore, its position could not take direct military or diplomatic action against the actions of the armies of various countries inside and outside the Settlement. At most, it could only send a protest letter to the Senior Consul to be forwarded to the Chinese authorities and ask the representatives of the countries concerned in Shanghai to support this protest. However, if the Consul General protested directly to the consuls of the Consular Body, it might be more effective. On the same day, the Shanghai Municipal Council also sent this intention to American Consul General and Senior Consul Cunningham, requesting him to send a letter to the Chinese authorities as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Foreign Warships Come to Shanghai to Protect Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>As the Shanghai war intensifies, the lives and property of various countries in the Settlement are in great danger. In addition to the large numbers of troops and warships that have already arrived from the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, more foreign warships arrived yesterday. A survey report is provided below:</p>
<h3>Portuguese Warship Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>After the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the Portuguese government immediately sent the cruiser Afonso de Albuquerque, carrying a large detachment of naval marines, to Shanghai. At 4:40 PM yesterday, it arrived at Wusong and sailed into the Huangpu River that night, mooring on the Jiangmian River in the French Concession. The soldiers remained on board and did not land. The ship came to Shanghai to join the International Settlement and assist in protecting overseas Chinese.</p>
<h3>American Warships Continue to Arrive</h3>
<p>After the outbreak of the war on the 28th of last month, the American destroyer USS Simpson was ordered by Admiral Taussig to carry a small detachment of marines to Nanjing to protect the capital. Now, because the situation in Nanjing is slightly better and the war situation in Shanghai is gradually pressing, the ship has been ordered to return to Shanghai. It entered the port at 12:10 PM yesterday and has already sailed into the Huangpu River to increase the strength of the stationed ships.</p>
<h3>British Warship Arrives</h3>
<p>The British gunboat HMS Bridgewater was telegraphed to Shanghai yesterday by Admiral Kelly, Commander-in-Chief of the Far East Navy stationed in Shanghai, to assist in the defense of the International Settlement. The ship arrived at 11:55 AM and is currently moored in the middle section of the Huangpu River.</p>
<h3>Railway Bureau Surveys Destroyed Bureau Site</h3>
<p>The Director's Office and All Departments Were Completely Destroyed</p>
<p>The Only Remaining Buildings Are the Materials Department Warehouses</p>
<p>Seals and Documents Completely Destroyed</p>
<p>The headquarters of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways was originally located in the North Railway Station building. Before the Japanese launched their attack, Ye, the former Minister of Railways, had ordered Guo Chengen, the Director of the two railways, to move as soon as possible and to properly preserve important documents to avoid danger. After Guo received the order, before he could rush to handle it, the Japanese army invaded Zhabei on the evening of the 28th of last month. The North Railway Station fell into the war zone and was the first to bear the brunt, being destroyed by the Japanese army's artillery fire and the bombs dropped by Japanese aircraft. All the railway bureau's office buildings were completely burned down, and all documents and equipment were destroyed, resulting in significant losses. Now, after Chen Xinghan took over as the Director of the two railways, he urgently wanted to survey the ruins, hoping to find undamaged items among the rubble, which would be taken back, and to assess the extent of the damage caused by the fire in order to find ways to handle the aftermath. For days, the Sino-Japanese war was fierce, and it was impossible to proceed. Yesterday, the British and American consuls in Shanghai and the Chinese and Japanese authorities agreed to a four-hour ceasefire from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM yesterday (12th) to allow refugees in Zhabei to escape danger. The railway bureau took advantage of this opportunity to select more than a dozen staff members, leading more than a dozen coolies, to go to the old site of the railway bureau at the North Railway Station at around 8:00 AM in the morning to survey everything. They departed in two groups, each in four or five cars, advancing from Fanwangdu in western Shanghai, turning onto Zhongshan Road, and detouring to the North Railway Station. They had previously agreed with the 19th Route Army and were accompanied by many soldiers from the army to protect them and accompany them to the station. After arriving at the station, they saw that the entire several-story building of the railway bureau had been completely burned down. The stairs to the upper floors had also been destroyed by the fire. The bureau members then found bamboo ladders to climb up to the various offices on the upper floors to inspect and search for remaining items. However, they saw that the Director's Office, the Secretary's Office, the General Affairs Department, the Engineering Department, the Document Section, the General Affairs Section, the Property Section, the Translation Section, the Audit Section, and other offices had been completely burned down. All documents and equipment in them had been turned to ashes and completely incinerated. The bureau members inspected and only found several safes in the various offices. Because they were made of iron, they remained mixed in the rubble after being burned and did not melt. The bureau members then opened one or two boxes with keys, but the contents were also burned through, and the documents and other items contained within were incinerated. Only a few of the railway bureau's seals, burned and charred, still retained their shape. The bureau members then collected these seals and several pieces of ironware and carried them back. The Car Department and other rooms on the lower floor were also completely burned down, while the Materials Department office and the North Station ticket office were not connected to the main building, were about several dozen steps away, and the buildings were very low, so they did not attract the enemy's attention and were fortunately not hit by bombs and burned down. How much damage was done to the documents and equipment inside is still awaiting further investigation. After the bureau members finished their inspection, it was almost noon. The soldiers who were protecting them were afraid that the enemy would attack and that they would have to resist, and they did not want the bureau members to take risks, so they urged them to return quickly. The bureau members then returned by car via the original route to the temporary office of the railway bureau to report everything. It is said that there are still three safes left on the upper floor of the destroyed railway bureau building that have not been opened. They plan to go with craftsmen again today (13th) to find a way to chisel them open in order to inspect whether there are any remaining items left.</p>
<h3>Germans Praise Our Army</h3>
<p>Giving Directions Were Amiable and Approachable. Our Soldiers of the 19th Route Army Bravely Resist the Enemy and Defend the Country, Bringing Glory to the Chinese Nation. Their Excellent Discipline Is Especially Recognized by China and Foreign Countries. Yesterday morning, Mr. Korchin, an engineer from Anmei Foreign Firm at No. 77 Weihaiwei Road in the International Settlement of this city, came to our office and said that he had gone to Zhenru on business on Thursday afternoon and passed through several defense lines of our army. The soldiers of the 19th Route Army he encountered along the way gave directions, all of whom were amiable and approachable, and were very polite. He asked to briefly record a few words in the newspaper to express his gratitude to the soldiers and their superiors.</p>
<h3>Inspection of Outer Hongkou</h3>
<p>A reporter from the Huadong News Agency proceeded from the Waibaidu Bridge at 10:00 AM yesterday. He did not encounter any Japanese soldiers along the way. At the north and south ends of the Outer Hongqiao Bridge, there was one Japanese soldier stationed each, one with a gun and one guarding a machine gun. Continuing east, he passed Zhaofeng Road, Gongping Road, Yuezhou Road, and reached Hongzhen in the Chinese area. He only saw one Japanese soldier at the corner of the HSBC Bank branch on Broadway Road. Residents moving south along the way were endless. After arriving at Hongzhen, he planned to continue forward, but the people in the town dissuaded him, saying that the Meilu area was full of Japanese troops and that there would be danger. He had to turn back immediately.</p>
<h3>Important Task of the International Settlement Volunteer Corps</h3>
<p>The defense line guarded by the International Settlement Volunteer Corps is now partially taken over by the 4th Regiment of the United States Marine Corps and the 31st Regiment of the Army. The front line now guarded by the Volunteer Corps is from Henan Road to Haining Road, and its rear defense area extends to the border of the French Concession. As commerce gradually returns to normal, more members of the Volunteer Corps are needed. On the 11th, there were 277 members on duty for defense and patrol. In addition, the Light Cavalry, the American Platoon, and the Armored Vehicle Platoon patrolled outside the boundary from time to time, and there were also several members of the reserve team to assist the police. According to the consistent policy of the Volunteer Corps, once an emergency has passed, members are returned as much as possible to their original occupations. The current plan is to convert half of the members into reservists, that is, the reservists can return to their original positions, but they should wear uniforms so that they can be summoned immediately in case of emergency. The platoon leaders are very willing to communicate with the employers frequently. Employers who want their employees to return to their jobs can directly contact the platoon leader in charge without having to go through the Volunteer Corps Headquarters, in order to save trouble. Recent newspapers have commented on whether the Volunteer Corps should defend the front line, but it must be known that the current situation is such that sudden changes are possible at any time. The security of the Settlement not only requires strict adherence to the boundary lines, but also requires a well-disciplined team that can be mobilized at any time. The Volunteer Corps is well suited to the former, while the latter is better suited to formal troops with sufficient equipment and good training. Currently, the major Chinese banks, Chinese newspapers, the General Post Office, and other important institutions are guarded by the Volunteer Corps, and the section of the defense line near the railway station has been guarded by the Volunteer Corps from the beginning. Therefore, the members are deeply unwilling to hear about being transferred to other teams to defend this area, because the members' relationship with the Settlement is much deeper than that of the teams transferred from other overseas locations. The Volunteer Corps Headquarters is very grateful for the donations of binoculars, boots, blankets, raincoats, and other items from all parties.</p>
<h3>Clarification from the Public Works Bureau on the Origins of Defense Zones</h3>
<p>The Hongkou District Designated as a Japanese Defense Zone: The Heads of the Foreign Armies in Shanghai Oversee the Public Works Bureau. The General Manager of the Bureau recently sent a letter to the Shanghai Real Estate Association, stating in the letter, "There is a significant misunderstanding in your communication. The Public Works Bureau did not participate in the allocation of Hongkou as a Japanese defense zone. The defense plan is overseen by the foreign armies stationed in Shanghai." The General Manager also replied to the Chinese Taxpayers Association, stating, "Your letter of February 7 is acknowledged. Although the Public Works Bureau is currently facing extreme difficulties, it is still striving to maintain order and security in the concession. The Bureau has not heard of the landing of Japanese troops at the Wayside Wharf as mentioned in your letter. However, the Public Works Bureau's political status is not that of an independent country, nor does it possess sovereign power. Therefore, it cannot directly interfere with the actions of any foreign power. However, the Bureau will do its utmost to maintain the integrity of the concession and the prosperity of commerce in this port. You can rest assured of this." He also stated to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, "Your letter of the 9th is acknowledged. I am pleased to know that the Food Price Stabilization Committee has been established. The Bureau is very grateful to the Shanghai merchants for helping to maintain the supply and fair prices of food. I am also pleased to learn from your letter that there will be no shortage of food."</p>
<h3>Statement from the 19th Route Army</h3>
<p>Please be Aware of Impersonation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Office of the 19th Route Army issued a statement regarding impersonation, sending a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday stating, "To whom it may concern, since our army's resistance against Japan began, we have been deeply grateful for the sincere assistance and support from all sectors of Shanghai, which has greatly inspired the soldiers at the front lines. Our army only knows to be responsible for defending our territory and to fight the enemy to the death. We know nothing else. We firmly believe that the actions of various domestic groups are motivated by patriotic fervor, and our army has never intervened. We do not recognize anyone who uses our army's name for any actions. This letter is to inform you accordingly, hoping you will take note."</p>
<h3>Letter from the General Labor Union to Compatriots Nationwide</h3>
<p>A letter from the Shanghai General Labor Union to compatriots nationwide states: Beloved compatriots across the nation, since the Japanese invaders occupied Shenyang on September 18th and gradually encroached upon the Northeast, a small number of shameless individuals embraced a policy of non-resistance, causing our thirty million compatriots to groan under the yoke of enslavement. Although General Ma Zhanshan fought against the Japanese with his isolated army, and patriotic volunteers rose up to kill the enemy, our government officials and those compatriots sleeping in their dreams remained indifferent, watching from the sidelines as our Northeast compatriots died one by one under the Japanese invaders' artillery fire. Beloved compatriots, how can we not feel pain? Now, the Japanese invaders' cruel methods are being replayed in Shanghai, murdering our parents and children, burning our homes and property, with corpses littering the ground and flames reaching the sky. The once prosperous city has been reduced to rubble, and many beloved compatriots have sacrificed their lives under the Japanese invaders' guns and cannons.</p>
<p>And airplanes and artillery continue to bombard us relentlessly. How do we, the surviving compatriots, feel in our hearts? What brings us comfort amidst this grief and indignation is the 19th Route Army's bloody resistance against Japan. We know that our country maintains an army of millions. In the past, the warlords' internal wars, with compatriots killing compatriots, were conducted with such pomp and bravery! But when foreign invaders attacked, they surrendered with a policy of non-resistance. Such shameless and brazen soldiers are hard to find anywhere else in the world. The 19th Route Army's self-defense against Japan is for the country, for justice, for the glory of our nation, and for the dignity of our soldiers. All the soldiers, without</p>
<p>fear or intimidation, with loyalty, determination, courage, and a determination to die, engaged with the strong enemy under fierce artillery fire. They not only did not lose an inch of land but also caused the invaders to be shocked and repeatedly defeated, and the policy of non-resistance</p>
<p>was thus broken. The spirit of Chinese soldiers defending their territory and resisting tyranny has spread throughout the world. Beloved compatriots, although we have achieved victory in these few days of fighting, Japanese warships and soldiers continue to arrive, and this brutal war cannot be easily ended. We must understand that this is a critical moment for the survival of our nation, and we must understand that "war can at most lead to national demise, but non-resistance is enough to exterminate us." We can only survive by fighting. Compatriots, disaster is upon us! We must sacrifice everything we have. Those with money should donate to support the soldiers, and those without money should contribute their labor to serve on the battlefield, to seek survival for the country, and to fight for the glory of the nation. Compatriots, rise up! Wake up! Do not remain drunken and muddled any longer. This is not a time for us to be afraid, to be intimidated, or to retreat. Summon our courage, invigorate our spirit, stir up our blood, ignite our fervor, and fight to the death with this demon of East Asia, the enemy of humanity! We believe that final victory will belong to us.</p>

<h3>Invited Members of the National Crisis Conference to Meet Today</h3>
<p>The invited members of the Shanghai National Crisis Conference held a tea party at the China Society on Weihaiwei Road the other day. More than thirty people attended, including Ma Xiangbo, Huang Yanpei, Sun Hongyi, Zhang Binglin, Wen Zongyao, Chu Fucheng, Wang Zaoshi, Wu Jingxiong, Peng Yunyi, etc. After exchanging opinions, they elected Huang Yanpei, Li Huang, Wang Zaoshi, Wu Jingxiong, and Peng Yunyi to organize the Shanghai National Crisis Conference. The communication office for the invited members of the Shanghai National Crisis Conference is responsible for investigating the members in Shanghai and convening meetings. It is recently reported that the investigation is almost complete. There are eighty-seven members in Shanghai, including Ma Xiangbo. Recently, a telegram came from Beiping reporting that members in Pingjin (Beiping and Tianjin) had automatically established a society on the sixth and invited the invited members in Shanghai</p>
<p>to proceed together (the message said): Mr. Huang Renzhi forwarded to the members in Shanghai for their consideration: Shanghai's resistance is somewhat comforting. There are about thirty members of the National Crisis Conference in Pingjin. It was resolved yesterday to automatically establish a society and hope that members in Shanghai will do the same (omitted below). Xiong Xiling respectfully. The communication office has now scheduled a meeting for today (the 13th) at 2 PM at the China Vocational Education Society at No. 80 Huanlong Road to convene a meeting of members in Shanghai for further consultation. According to the person in charge of the communication office, fearing that the investigation of members' addresses in Shanghai is incomplete or that mail delivery is delayed, it is hoped that the invited members will attend the meeting after seeing the report.</p>
<h3>Chinese Taxpayers Association Declares Reasons for Not Opening the Market</h3>
<p>Unwilling to Open the Market Unless Three Resolutions are Achieved. The Chinese Taxpayers Association sent a letter to the Public Works Bureau of the Public Concession yesterday, declaring that unless three resolutions are achieved, merchants and residents would rather sacrifice everything than open the market. The original letter states: "To whom it may concern, we have received a letter from the Nanjing Road Business Association and the First Branch of the Citizens' Association stating that, according to the letter from member stores on this road, the Shanghai Incident was caused by the Public Works Bureau of the Public Concession facilitating Japanese military actions, leading to the suspension of business. Therefore, an emergency meeting was specially convened and unanimously resolved on three conditions as follows: (1) Japanese troops must completely withdraw from Shanghai; (2) The Public Works Bureau must reclaim the police power of the concession and investigate the missing residents, fulfilling its obligation to protect the safety of taxpayers; (3) After the above two conditions are implemented, the Public Works Bureau must be responsible for preventing Japanese residents from provoking incidents under any pretext and for preventing further inhuman and barbaric actions. In order to implement our demands and to seek survival, we would rather sacrifice everything than open the market until these goals are achieved. We hope you will inform the Public Works Bureau to take effective measures so that we can restore our cooperation and promote welfare as soon as possible, etc. As such, we find that the Japanese military's disturbance in Shanghai was in fact caused by the Japanese military having the convenience of the concession, which no one can deny. Our association and other public organizations have repeatedly sent letters to your bureau urging you to take effective measures, but they have not been implemented, which is a matter of great concern. If this situation continues to drag on, Shanghai's prosperity and the interests of Chinese and foreigners, directly and indirectly, will be destroyed by the Japanese military. In accordance with the letter, we hereby request you to investigate and handle it promptly."</p>
<h3>Various Industries Affected by the Current Situation Issued Announcements Yesterday</h3>
<h3>Wool Industry Determines How to Handle Orders</h3>
<p>The Wool Industry Association, indignant at the Japanese invasion, decided to continue the strike to resist aggression, and the Executive Committee resolved the following temporary measures for handling orders: (1) For goods not yet loaded on ships, loading should be stopped immediately; (2) For goods being transported but not yet arrived, they should be landed in Hong Kong for temporary storage; (3) For goods already arrived, they should be temporarily stored in customs warehouses. In addition to notifying the import companies, the association has also published announcements in Chinese and Western newspapers.</p>
<h3>Cotton Fabric Industry Unable to Fulfill Order Obligations</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Cotton Fabric Association sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, stating: "To whom it may concern, we have sent a letter to the Harmonious Merchant Association and the British Chamber of Commerce, stating that the Japanese have provoked trouble without cause, attacking our Zhabei and Wusong with naval and land forces, and wantonly bombing with aircraft and heavy artillery, turning the prosperous city into desolate rubble. The tragic deaths of residents in that area are countless. Even the Public Concession and the French Concession have been affected. The current situation caused by the Japanese atrocities is as follows: (1) The city's commerce is completely shut down; (2) Commercial transportation on all roads is completely blocked; (3) The number of unemployed people has suddenly increased by hundreds of thousands; (4) The financial losses are no less than tens of millions. Moreover, for more than ten days, the Japanese have continued to intensify their various atrocities. It is difficult to estimate the extent of the damage in the future. The Japanese are attacking us by advancing from the concession and retreating from the concession, using the Public Concession as their base of operations. The Public Concession is jointly managed by various countries, and it should strictly adhere to its neutral nature. How can it allow the Japanese to destroy it without restraint? Since the countries concerned and the concession authorities are familiar with the Japanese destruction but do not strictly prevent it, the countries concerned and the concession authorities should bear full responsibility for the facts caused thereby and the losses suffered. Our colleagues in the association have previously ordered goods from various foreign firms belonging to your association. Due to the aforementioned incidents, they cannot fulfill their obligations, and they cannot bear any responsibility for the losses incurred thereby. A special letter is issued to declare this, hoping you will take note of it and forward it to the foreign firms." A copy of the letter is enclosed for your reference, hoping you will promptly notify the various industry associations to unanimously advocate this.</p>
<h3>Watch and Clock Industry Suspends Orders and Payments to Foreign Merchants</h3>
<p>The watch and clock industry in this city, concerned about the Public Works Bureau's failure to protect the safety of the Public Concession, decided to notify foreign firms to stop ordering and shipping goods and to suspend payments of accounts. The original letter to the foreign merchants is excerpted as follows: "To whom it may concern, since January 28th, the Japanese military has relied on its military force, using the concession as a base to attack our Chinese-controlled Zhabei. Artillery fire has been continuous, and wanton bombing has reduced Zhabei and the North Sichuan Road area of the concession to scorched earth. Countless innocent civilians have been massacred, and there has been an increasing number of victims in various districts of the Public Concession due to Japanese aircraft dropping bombs. Our Chinese merchants have suffered losses estimated to be in the hundreds of millions, and at this time of year-end settlements, it is difficult to collect debts from others, and there is no way to settle debts owed to others. Our colleagues in the industry have been deeply affected by this disaster. If this continues, it will not only hurt our industry but will also affect foreign merchants. Therefore, on February 9th, we convened our colleagues to discuss how to maintain our operations and resolved that while the Sino-Japanese war is not over and the safety of the concession is not guaranteed, all goods ordered from foreign merchants will be stopped, and all payments to foreign merchants will be suspended until the Public Works Bureau can effectively protect the safety of the concession. We hope you will take note of this." Sincerely, Shanghai Watch and Clock Industry Association, February 12th.</p>

<h3>Volunteer Corps Recruiting Translators</h3>
<p>As the troops from various countries have successively arrived to replace the defense of the International Volunteer Corps, the members of the Chinese team in the defense line are concurrently serving as translators in various locations, continuing to work day and night, which has become even more burdensome. A team of translators is now being formed to supplement the force. Donations are being requested from various firms and companies to solicit new team members to join the translation team. Many people have voluntarily joined, and those who are enthusiastic about sponsoring can quickly send representatives to Room 286, No. 17 Fuzhou Road to contact and register.</p>
<h3>Ships to Ningbo Suspended Yesterday</h3>
<p>It is said that two Taikoo Line Ningbo ships will be allowed to sail today. The "New Beijing" arrived late yesterday and could not load cargo. However, the refugees going to Ningbo were crowded at the dock. When the ship arrived at the port, they rushed up. The ship was afraid that the draft was too light and there were too many passengers, so it issued a temporary notice for the passengers to disembark. However, the passengers did not agree. Later, the company asked British sailors to board the ship and persuade the passengers to leave the ship. The passengers then disembarked one after another. The ship will now sail to Ningbo this afternoon. Seeing the crowding of passengers, the company added the "Luzhou" ship to sail to Ningbo this afternoon at 3:00 PM.</p>

<h3>Notice to Those Leaving Shanghai for the Interior</h3>
<p>Information on Trains and Small Steamers from Shanghai to Various Ports</p>
<p>Recently, the military situation in Shanghai has been tense, and the number of passengers seeking refuge elsewhere has been increasing daily. Yangtze River and Ningbo steamers are extremely crowded, and there are often people climbing on the roofs of the ships, which is very dangerous. It has been found that those traveling from Shanghai to Zhenjiang and other ports who do not wish to take the Yangtze River steamers can take the Shanghai-Hangzhou train to Jiaxing and then transfer to a small steamer to Suzhou (two departures daily, 10:00 AM and 3:00 PM). From Suzhou, take the train to Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, and other ports. This is safer and avoids danger. Those going to Ningbo can take the Shanghai-Hangzhou train at 3:00 PM to Hangzhou, stay overnight in Hangzhou, cross the river the next morning, take a bus to Cao'e River, and then transfer to a train to Ningbo, arriving around 3:00 PM that afternoon. For more information, please inquire at the China Travel Service at Jing'an Temple Road and Baxianqiao, Sichuan Road in this city.</p>
<h3>Accountants Association Organizes a Damage Investigation and Statistics Table on Japanese Soldiers</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Accountants Association held a regular meeting yesterday and resolved to follow the resolution of the Provisional Executive Committee to organize a Damage Investigation and Statistics Committee on Japanese Soldiers, composed of all members.

(G) Member Jiang Wanping suggested that all members be notified to provide as many rescue opinions as possible, and that a national crisis discussion meeting be held every three days to address urgent work. It was resolved to hold meetings every Tuesday and Friday at 1:30 PM. All executive and supervisory committee members are requested to attend, and all members are requested to participate as if it were a regular meeting. No separate notification will be given.</p>
<h3>Yu Zhengping's Words to Movie Theaters</h3>
<p>The Whole City is on Strike, Everyone Has Workers, Can the Film Industry Alone Not Endure the Pain? Mr. Yu Zhengping sent a letter to this newspaper, saying: "To the Editor, After reading the telegram of the generals of the 19th Route Army today, the words are stern, the righteousness is just, and the emotion is overwhelming. In particular, I hope that our people will provide spiritual and material support. All those with blood and courage will respond in unison. It is my understanding that with foreign aggression rampant, our hard-working and meritorious patriotic soldiers are shedding blood on the battlefield. At a time when the threat of thieves is slightly diminished, many Chinese-owned movie theaters in the concessions of this city are actually open for screenings, which is extremely detrimental to the patriotic enthusiasm of the people. Such a nation that does not know shame allows friendly countries to laugh at it. The announcement claims that it is maintaining the livelihood of workers. If the whole city is on strike, who doesn't have workers? At this time when everyone is united in enduring pain and sacrifice, how can the film industry disregard public opinion and arbitrarily open for business? Furthermore, Japanese ronin are treacherous and cunning, and it is inevitable that they will throw bombs in crowded places. It is the film theaters that entice the people to enjoy themselves, providing them with the opportunity to kill themselves. For the sake of cherishing our compatriots, my heart feels uneasy and I cannot remain silent. My personal propaganda is weak, so I earnestly ask you to disclose the original letter in the newspaper. Its effect is better than a long tongue. Sincerely, Yu Zhengping, February 10, 20th year."</p>
<h3>Temporary Changes in Postal Service</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration announced that due to the impact of the current situation, the office hours of all branch offices will be temporarily changed to 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, or 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM, and their business operations will also be temporarily changed. Details are as follows: (1) The six branch offices at Longhua, Gaochangmiao, Zhabei North Railway Station, North Sichuan Road, and Zhongshan Road will be temporarily closed. All business related to the payment of money orders and withdrawal of non-current savings at the Zhabei North Railway Station, North Sichuan Road, and Wusong Road branch offices will be temporarily transferred to this administration. Those belonging to Longhua will be transferred to the Xujiahui branch office, and those belonging to Gaochangmiao will be transferred to the Kangti Road branch office. In addition, savings and money order services at the Zhongshan Road branch office will be transferred to the Baili South Road branch office. (2) Savings, money order, and insured mail services at the Fangbang Road, Zhaojiabang Road, West Gate, Nanshi, Bund, and Avenue Edward VII branch offices will be temporarily suspended.

<h3>Ji Hongtai Privately Rents Trucks to the Japanese Army</h3>
<p>Treacherous merchants, greedy for profit and exploited by the Japanese army, dare to rent out cars and cargo trucks to the enemy to transport Japanese soldiers. All sectors of society, upon hearing the news, are outraged. According to an investigation by the Cargo Truck Industry Association, the company that privately rented trucks to the violent Japanese is Ji Hongtai Company. The association has reported the matter to the Social Affairs Bureau for investigation. The previously reported China Rich Company was a mistake for Ji Hongtai. As for the large trucks of China Rich Company, they have been ordered to the front lines of our army, and all trucks that have not departed have been parked at the association.</p>
<h3>Foreign Merchants Helping the Enemy in Transportation Prolongs the War</h3>
<p>The Entire Transportation Industry Objects</p>
<p>A certain foreign firm in this city has completely supplied all its cargo vehicles (more than twenty) and large barges (more than thirty) for Japanese military use. Yesterday, it also forced more than 300 Chinese drivers and boatmen employed by the firm to work for the Japanese in transportation. The drivers and boatmen, due to their conscience, insisted on refusing and issued a warning. The entire transportation industry, upon hearing this news, has officially submitted a letter to the regimental government requesting the termination of the contract for transporting a large batch of goods entrusted to it by our side and to investigate all losses incurred by its assistance to the enemy and order it to compensate for them.</p>
<h3>Japanese Plainclothes Team Sets Fire</h3>
<p>Burning Residences on Hesketh Road</p>
<p>At around 3:00 AM yesterday, six members of a Japanese plainclothes team, each carrying kerosene and oily paper, sneaked into the Zhang family's residence at No. 17, Hesketh Road, Bazhi Road, and set fire to it. First, they poured kerosene on the gate, and then set it on fire. The Japanese plainclothes team also lit the oily paper and set fire to the surrounding easily flammable areas. For a time, the flames soared into the sky, but because the residents of the building had already evacuated, no one was injured. The fire department, upon hearing the news, immediately dispatched fire trucks to put out the fire. The Japanese plainclothes team opened fire to stop them, so the fire continued to burn until around 10:00 AM, and the extent of the damage is impossible to investigate.</p>
<h3>Gunshots on Avenue Dubail</h3>
<p>Chinese Constable Accidentally Triggers the Trigger; Citizen's Life Sacrificed. At around 2:30 PM yesterday, two small newspaper vendors at the intersection of Rue Delastre and Avenue Dubail in the French Concession were shouting and selling an extra edition of the New Continent newspaper. At that time, a young passerby bought a copy to examine it closely, but the content contained completely reactionary words and false news slandering important people. The young man couldn't help but feel angry, thinking that at this time of national crisis, the newspaper vendors should not be selling such reactionary newspapers, which could cause misunderstandings among the people. At that time, the young man, filled with righteous indignation, explained the great principle to the two newspaper vendors and strongly urged them not to sell them anymore. However, the two vendors not only refused to listen to the advice, but also retorted to the young man, blaming him for meddling in their affairs. So, the two sides argued for a long time, and the passerby also gathered a crowd. In about ten minutes, about three or four hundred people had gathered, all intending to hand the two over to the police station. However, while the commotion was ongoing, a No. 2 tram from the French Concession, traveling from east to west, arrived. When it reached the corner of Rue Delastre, the driver, seeing the large number of people, stopped the car. At the same time, a Chinese constable numbered 366 from the French police station jumped off the car, pushed through the crowd, and took out the pistol he was wearing, waving his hand and ordering the passersby to make way. Inadvertently, he accidentally triggered the trigger with a bang, and a bullet came out of the gun and hit Li Shuangyu, a Nanjing native, who owned the Yumingyuan hot water shop at No. 118, Rue Delastre, in the right waist. Li fell to the ground in response and died immediately. The constable, seeing that he had caused the trouble, tried to take the opportunity to flee, but was intercepted by the passersby and, together with the two newspaper vendors, escorted to the Grand Boucle police station. The police chief sent detectives to investigate, inspected the body, and sent it to the Tongren Fuyuantang autopsy room to wait for the examination. According to the family of the deceased, the deceased was 47 years old and had an elderly mother, Liu, 71 years old, a wife, Wang, 46 years old, an older brother named Shuangjin, 52 years old, and a younger brother named Shuangfu, 30 years old. He had just called his younger brother, Lin Di, to go home, but unexpectedly, as soon as he reached the door, he suffered the tragic accident.</p>

<h3>Yan Huiqing Sends Letter to League of Nations Urging Convening of Special Assembly</h3>
<p>Submitted Within the Statutory Deadline</p>
<p>Council to Consider Our Country's Dispatch</p>
<p>(Geneva) Dr. Yan's letter to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations stated in brief: According to Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant, the Administrative Council has the power to submit this case to the Assembly. The article also stipulates that within 14 days after submitting a dispute to the Administrative Council, an application can be made to submit the case to the Assembly. The Chinese government, constrained by the time limit, hereby applies to submit this case to the Assembly. However, if the Administrative Council voluntarily submits the case to the Assembly, or convenes the Assembly in accordance with the powers conferred upon it, the Chinese government intends to withdraw this application. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) China's letter to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations was submitted just before the expiration of the statutory 14-day deadline (i.e., within 14 days after the submission under Article 15, the right to request the convening of a special assembly can be exercised). The letter does not constitute a firm demand for the convening of a special assembly. It states that if China can be assured that the League of Nations Administrative Council can reach an agreement in a slightly later meeting, and that a special assembly of the League of Nations is convened while the Disarmament Conference is still in session, then China may not immediately exercise its right to convene the assembly. If this assurance or agreement cannot be obtained, China intends to exercise its right immediately. Dr. Yan's attitude reveals his unwillingness to embarrass the Administrative Council while simultaneously demonstrating his unwillingness to sacrifice a very important privilege. League of Nations officials have expressed the opinion that, according to the League of Nations Covenant, under certain circumstances, there can be a hesitation of three months before convening a special meeting of the Assembly. However, the Administrative Council can also decide, by a majority of its members, to convene it in a short period. The Administrative Council does not seem to be delaying the case, and therefore preparations for convening the Assembly can be made within a week or ten days. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The twelve members of the League of Nations Administrative Council are scheduled to meet at 5:30 tonight to consider China's letter, which will be released this afternoon. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Geneva Our country's chief representative, Mr. Yan, stated today that he will request the League of Nations Council to convene a general assembly of all member states to consider the Shanghai situation. It is now believed that if the Chinese government, as a member state, requests the convening of a general assembly, then the League of Nations will be obliged to convene it. According to some small countries in the League of Nations, advocating for the convening of a general assembly has been a long-standing position. They believe that larger countries inevitably want to disregard the facts and show sympathy towards Japan. Previous League of Nations Council meetings on the Liaoning case were manipulated by countries that sided with Japan. Since the Shanghai Incident, many small countries in the League of Nations have increasingly believed that Japan's invasion of Manchuria is secretly aided by powerful nations. They believe that after convening a general assembly, the atmosphere of the League of Nations can be clarified. (National Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, well-informed sources here claimed that League of Nations officials are considering the possibility of convening a special general assembly of the League of Nations as soon as possible, given the alarming reports from Shanghai. It is reported that several major countries, including Britain, are currently promoting this approach, believing it to be the only way to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute satisfactorily. Since Japanese aircraft bombed the International Settlement, all countries have become more aware of the seriousness of the Sino-Japanese dispute. (National Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Late yesterday, the Chinese delegation decided not to invoke Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant to request the convening of a special meeting of the Assembly, following the advice of several countries. The Chinese delegation's official letter to the League of Nations Secretariat has already been drafted and prepared for issuance. However, Chief Representative Dr. Yan suddenly decided at the last minute not to take this extreme step, as the representatives of the great powers are currently engaged in direct negotiations with all parties concerned in Shanghai. If China invokes Article 15, it is feared that it may hinder these negotiations and be greatly unwelcome by the great powers. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) At noon today, Dr. Yan sent a letter to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations stating that China intends to exercise its rights under Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant to apply for the convening of a special meeting of the League of Nations Assembly. Reuters representatives here received reliable information that the report of a dispute between Yan Huiqing and Liu Wendao regarding their attitudes towards the Council's discussion of the Sino-Japanese dispute is untrue and not as reported by Reuters. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) China has decided to invoke Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant. Representatives from all countries are now gathered in Geneva. Therefore, according to Article 15, the special meeting of the League of Nations Assembly requested by China can be convened immediately. The Chinese delegation feels that appealing to the League of Nations Assembly is beneficial and harmless, and believes that the more public the case is, the more beneficial it will be to China. Therefore, the Chinese representatives will notify the League of Nations Secretariat tonight, requesting the immediate convening of a special meeting of the Assembly. The main point of Article 15 is that Article 15 and Article 16 are mutually related. Article 16 concerns any country that resorts to war in disregard of its obligations under Article 12 of the Covenant. The countries in the League may apply economic sanctions to completely block</p>

<p>Telegram from Guangzhou: To all newspapers and organizations: The enemy adheres to its policy of aggression, occupying our Northeast and now pressing forward relentlessly, attacking Shanghai, first with warships, then with airplanes, bombarding our innocent compatriots, causing corpses to litter the streets and houses to burn to ashes, which is inhumane and enraging. The 19th Route Army has risen to resist, expressing the indignation of the people. The comrades of our Guangdong Air Force, upholding the spirit of national salvation through aviation, have always been consistent in resisting foreign aggression and will fulfill their declaration. Given the sudden deepening of foreign aggression and the imminent demise of the nation, we, responsible for air defense, vow to resist the aggressors. We have long been prepared to go north and implement self-defense. However, Guangzhou and Shantou are currently facing the same serious situation and must make arrangements nearby to prepare for resistance. Currently, the key coastal areas of Guangdong are prepared for air defense. We mobilized on the 10th of this month to go to Shanghai to fight the enemy. Although our country's air force is materially inferior, in order to seek survival for the nation and to fight for the dignity of the people, we can no longer endure humiliation. We would rather be martyrs than slaves of a vanquished nation. They rely on material resources, and we rely on our ardent blood. With the same determination, we go forward to meet the national crisis. However, when the enemy attacks, it must have a complete plan. If their great desires are not satisfied, then our disaster will not end. We hope that all compatriots in the country will recognize the air force as an important military force in national defense and work together to raise funds so that material resources can be replenished so that we can sustain the fight against the enemy. The time of national collapse is near, and we will perish together. We hope that all will rise up together to fight. When the nest is overturned, no egg remains intact. May all gentlemen of the country remember this. Zhang Huichang, Huang Guangrui, Hu Jinya, Yang Guanyu, Zhou Baoheng, Deng Tongming, Ding Jixu, Chen Yousheng, Tan Shou, Liu Zhiyan, Mei Long'an, Zhang Zixuan, Chen Xiu, Hu Weixian, Chen Zhuolin, and Zhou Bocheng, leading all aviation comrades, respectfully bow.</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Situation in Japan After the Shanghai Incident (Compiled and Translated from Japanese Newspapers)</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese army invaded Shanghai, how its domestic situation has developed is something that the people of our country would like to know. Here is a systematic classification and summary translation of the main points from the records of famous Japanese newspapers (Tokyo Jiji Shimbun, Tokyo Hochi Shimbun, Osaka Mainichi Shimbun, the three major Japanese newspapers):</p>
<p>Diplomacy: Japan, with its established policy, destroyed Shanghai, the world's commercial center. Before the incident, it thought that the Shanghai army would also be as resistant as the Northeast Army, and that it would be able to take the entire Chinese-controlled area of Shanghai as easily as taking something out of a bag, without affecting the concessions and without unexpected diplomatic problems. When the incident broke out, it was repeatedly defeated in the north, and the Japanese army frequently endangered the public concession with aircraft and bullets. The British, American, and French ambassadors stationed in Tokyo first issued verbal warnings to the Japanese government. On the 2nd of this month, they formally received instructions from their respective governments. British Ambassador Lindley, American Ambassador Forbes, and French Ambassador Martel visited Foreign Minister Yoshizawa together and raised three issues: (1) Request the Japanese government not to continue sending troops to Shanghai. (2) Establish a neutral zone between the Chinese and Japanese armies, and at the same time, request the Japanese army to quickly withdraw from the public concession. (3) The Chinese army should also withdraw to a certain location. At that time, the Japanese government was unwilling to recognize the first and third items. The second item, the neutral zone, was not specifically designated for operational convenience, and it absolutely refused to retreat a step. As a result, the three ambassadors left unhappily. Yoshizawa stated that he would give a formal reply to the ambassadors within three days. However, at this time, the Japanese government internally felt quite distressed by the actions of the three countries, considering them an interference in military actions. All agreed to discuss the matter at length. That night, Yoshizawa consulted with Inukai Tsuyoshi, Naval Minister Osumi Mineo, and Army Minister Araki Sadao to draft a reply. Because of the strong attitudes of the army and navy, it was decided on the spot that the main points of the reply would be: (1) Whether or not to continue sending Japanese troops would depend on the situation on the Chinese side, but in order to protect the interests of Shanghai, it would still be necessary to continue sending self-defense forces when necessary. (2) If the lives and property of Japanese residents are entrusted to the protection of a third country and the Japanese army is withdrawn, the situation in Shanghai must be investigated before a decision can be made. (3) Order the Chinese army to withdraw first to reduce the danger of conflict between the two armies. On the same day, Tokyo received proposals from Washington and the United Kingdom and the United States for direct negotiations with Japan, and learned that the attitude of the British representative, Drummond, in Geneva was strong, advocating the cessation of hostilities on both sides, the withdrawal of combatants, the establishment of a neutral zone, the protection of the public concession, the assumption of responsibility for security by neutrals, and the promotion of speedy negotiations between China and Japan to resolve important disputes between the two countries based on the Non-Aggression Pact and the resolution of the League of Nations Council on December 9, without any reservations. Other countries such as Italy and France also coordinated with the United Kingdom and the United States and did their best to preside over the matter. The situation in Geneva seemed to be mostly unfavorable to Japan. The Japanese representative, Sato, paid special attention to Japan, and the Japanese representative at that time, in view of the dissatisfaction of various countries with Japan, gradually softened his stance. Therefore, the next day (the 4th, the Tokyo Jiji Shimbun published an editorial entitled "Standard as the Formal Protest of the United Kingdom and the United States," expressing the opinion that "We hope that the Japanese army will exercise self-restraint." It must not expand the useless dispute. The Manchurian issue has been trumpeted to the world, and Shanghai is a large commercial port in the Orient since ancient times, with many Europeans and Americans residing there. International relations are very complicated. The sudden outbreak of war there is even more serious than the Manchurian Incident. If the world is alarmed and misunderstood, it will inevitably lead to major unfortunate events with third countries::" That day, Yoshizawa, believing that the situation was dangerous, visited Elder Saionji at his villa in Okitsu to report on the attitudes of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and Italy, and to ask for instructions on how to deal with the situation. Yoshizawa returned to Tokyo and again consulted with Inukai. Inukai then issued a statement to the world, falsely accusing China of disrupting peace and asking various countries to recognize the facts. The statement was distributed to the Foreign Affairs Committee of the US Senate and to various members of Congress, making various clever arguments to cover up its brutal facts, distort right and wrong, and confuse black and white. As a result, Washington and London were deceived, and the situation changed favorably. European newspapers also published Inukai's statement, expressing considerable sympathy for it. (The reporter deeply sighs at the failure of our country's diplomacy and the deterioration of the international situation, mainly because our country falls behind others in everything and does not declare to the world in advance</p>
<p>The aggressive ambitions of the violent Japanese, being slandered by them and not refuting the newly emerging barbaric acts of the Japanese based on facts one by one, it is no wonder that various countries are deceived.) Japan, having sold its trick, convened a cabinet meeting on the 5th and then summoned Naval Minister Osumi Mineo, Army Minister Araki Sadao, Foreign Minister Yoshizawa, etc. to Inukai's private residence to discuss the Shanghai issue, deciding to proceed with the established policy. On the 6th, the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun published a headline saying "The atmosphere is better because the United States has obtained Japan's response," vaguely saying that the US Ambassador to Japan, Forbes, reported during his visit to Yoshizawa that the US government understood and that Japan was quite optimistic. The above is the news obtained from the Japanese newspapers before the 6th. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Songjiang After the Shanghai Incident</h3>
<p>Songjiang Bank Suddenly Suspends Business and Clears Accounts: Since the outbreak of the Shanghai incident, the local security in Songjiang has been maintained by the military and police, and it has been as quiet as usual. However, the banking industry has followed in Shanghai's footsteps and uniformly suspended business, financial stagnation has occurred, and the settlement of accounts in various industries has been unable to begin. The County Chamber of Commerce then convened a meeting of various industries and decided to postpone it for a week. The grain tax has always been paid by businesses on the eve of the lunar New Year, but this year there are very few payments, less than one-tenth of the usual amount. Currently, various banks have posted notices to open on the 9th, but Songjiang Bank still has its doors tightly closed, and rumors are circulating, saying that it has been affected by the Shanghai branch, and some say that it was caused by the managers of the bank engaging in speculation and losing money. However, it is said that various local public funds in the county, such as education surtaxes, etc., are stored in the bank, and the number of those who invested in the stock with public funds is also not small. Therefore, the president of the bank, Xie Liangda, initially tried to raise funds in the hope of opening the bank the next day, but on the 10th, the bank announced that it would invite lawyer Zhang Baopei and accountant Wang to clear the accounts, and would consider resuming business after everything was settled. The general depositors and savers are all worried. It is said that the bank has a deficit of more than 1,009,000 yuan, and owes about 500,000 to 600,000 yuan, of which Ding Ji owes more than 200,000, and temporary notes owe 60,000. The identity of those responsible for auditing the accounts is unknown. Among the depositors, public funds such as the Education Fund of more than 100,000 yuan and the Property Management Office of more than 30,000 yuan are relied upon by local businesses, and it is not known how to deal with the aftermath. After receiving the report, the county government immediately sent a letter to the County Chamber of Commerce to have them, together with County Commissioner Li Kexian, go to inspect the accounts at 3 p.m. on the 10th. It is said that only more than 8,000 yuan in cash remains. It is also said that the day before the bank announced the clearance, it still had more than 70,000 yuan in cash in the vault. Therefore, the general depositors are quite dissatisfied with the private withdrawal of deposits. As for the president of the bank, he has already taken his family to escape.</p>
<p>Establishment of the National Crisis Temporary Relief Society: All circles in the county, sympathizing with the displaced refugees from Shanghai who have nowhere to live, and after the return of local residents Lu Guiliang and Zhang Xiaotong from Shanghai, have negotiated the organization of a reception center. After several meetings in the Firefighting Federation, the Songjiang County National Crisis Temporary Relief Society has been formed. Shen Juncong, the county magistrate, and gentry Jin Jingchu, Cai Jiping, Zhang Xiaomei, Lu Guiliang, Wu Chengfu, and others were elected as economic committee members, taking turns working and each paying 200 yuan in advance for expenses, printing donation books to raise funds, and setting up the Joseph Hospital and Dongwai Yu Residence as two reception centers. In recent days, two batches of refugees have come to Songjiang and have been received at Dongwai Yu Residence.</p>
