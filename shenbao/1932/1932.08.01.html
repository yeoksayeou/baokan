<p>時評</p>
<h3>德國最近政局之轉變</h3>
<p>本月二十日。德國聯邦政府。突以大總統之緊急令解散普魯士邦政府。特命首相巴本爲該邦之統監。並停止其憲法。而易以巴本統監之獨裁。此事在表面上。雖屬德國一部分之政變但普魯士爲德國之核心。其一變一動。皆足以影響於大體。牽一髮而動全身。固未能僅視爲一國或一部之變動也。大戰以還。德意志政局。無日不在混沌之中。考其原由。固不全在乎財政之困難。而共和政治基礎之動搖。亦爲其主因之一。前年三月。米拉内閣因財政困難而崩潰。繼其後者爲白魯寗内閣。白氏組閣之初。爲鞏固中央穩健派之政權起見。曾一再裁抑社會黨之勢力。但在總選舉以後。國社黨與共産黨大獲勝利。於是白氏不得不變其初衷。拉攏反對黨之社會民主黨以相抗衡而造成中央黨與社會黨合作之局面。</p>
<p>白魯寗之傾向社會黨。在國權伸張主義者之心目中。殊屬不滿。而尤爲興登堡總統所不容。今年夏初。白内閣終爲環境壓迫而瓦解。五月末日。無名之退役軍人巴本。遂拜命組閣。是爲德國政局之一大轉變。亦即興登堡裁抑社會民主黨之明日表示。興登堡之此種舉措。究屬爲罪爲功。姑置不論。但事實上今日德國國内情形複雜。有國粹社會黨。有共産黨有鐵兜團之國權黨。有鐵壁團之社會民主黨等多數之政治組織。而國社黨與共産黨間。更常用直接之暴力行動。互相爭鬭。此種錯綜複雜情形。要皆爲德國政治前途之危機。過去普魯士總選舉與德國大總統選舉之結果。國社黨已獲得極大之進展。而興登堡且又力爲庇護。最近國社黨褐色制服着用之解禁。其實際上之意義。即不啻默許國社黨之可以整裝暴行。共産黨在此種情形之下。自亦不得不出於（以暴酬暴）之一策。而釀成新舊兩派衝突之折熱化。今春四月。普魯士議會選舉結果。國社黨雖屬第一黨。但以非絕對多數之故。普政府之總理。仍爲社會民主黨之白朗氏。巴本組閣以後。即千方百計以壓迫之。抑留聯邦政府交付普邦之資金。封閉柏林二大社會民主黨系之報館。在在都足以表現聯邦政府之反社會民主黨。而欲以獨裁主義代自由主義也。巴本組閣後之解散議會與今次普魯士邦政府閣僚之總罷免。要皆爲此種政治轉向所形成。</p>
<p>普魯士於德國聯邦中之地位。最占重要。普魯士獨裁政治之實現。不啻爲德國國社黨勝利之先聲。國社黨在德國聯邦中之抬頭。必將引起共産黨極端之反抗。異日國共兩黨抗爭之激化。恐將造成德國空前之大騷擾。而届時之政府。亦必將乘此機會。藉彈壓之理由。以造成全德之絕對的獨裁。若全德獨裁。竟一旦實現。則歐洲必將發生神經過敏之（恐德論。）而引起一不可思議之風浪。此殆亦吾人所可臆料者也。</p>

<p>富麗煌煇之台維斯杯</p>

<p>法選手死裏逃生第二盤開始、柯顯以發球有力而勝第一局、但第二局愛律森球勢迅急、以一比一造成平手、美國組球術極有秩序、壁壘森嚴、法國大爲所窘、故雖取攻勢、但極謹愼、美國組時以高球擾敵後方、但法人無不予以回擊、於是愛律森深感危險、力自振作、雙方是時爲五比五之比、競爭極烈、雙方球員皆似極煩躁、失着極多、美國組勝第十一局、法國形勢岌岌可危、幸得造成均勢、雙方乃時時變更策略、千方百計謀使敵人失措、旋由六比六、至七比七、而至八比八、美國方而愛律森力謀急急獲勝、顯然可見、但旋比數又至九比七、最後爲十一比十一之比、四人中技術方面、似以愛氏最爲精嫻、美國組時向勃魯尼翁進攻、但法國組以絕大努力、竟得以十三比十一勝第二盤、</p>
<p>第三盤又屬美國第三盤中競爭之烈與前無異、勃魯尼翁球術最合法度、法國組初以三比一佔先、但美國恢復均勢、爲三比三之比、至是雙方顯有　狀、球勢亦從而鬆懈、比數達五比五、結果美國以七比五勝第三盤、</p>
<p>愛律森因倦而敗休息十分鐘後球員復入塲中、法國組似得休息之益、而顯佔優勢、是時球勢頗疾、四人皆立場底、俟球之至卽予回擊、落點皆極準確、一時勝負未决、觀衆爲之氣促、愛律森頗露疲乏、於是對方向愛氏集中進攻、法國組旋以六比四勝第四盤、雙方勢均力敵、各勝兩盤、乃决最後勝負、</p>
<p>美國組最後成功第五盤開始、雙小心將事、毫無失着、球勢迅疾、球術嚴峻、法國組向范令進攻、愛律森雖極疲乏、勇氣未衰極力襄助范氏、於是比數達三比三、但第七局中柯顯發球竟歸失敗、美國組乃愈加努力、法國組雖力謀挽救、但大勢已去終無能爲力、美國遂以六比四勝最後一盤、結果比數爲六比三、十一比十三、七比五、四比六、六比四比賽共歷二小時又半、兩日結果、法國仍以二比一佔先、</p>
<p>巴洛屈拉（法國大功臣）</p>
<p>擊敗美國大將梵恩斯與愛律森</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>（二）法國大受虚驚</p>
<p>因雙打之敗引起之恐怖</p>
<p>哈瓦斯三十日巴黎電台維斯盃雙打比賽、美國隊得勝之後、燦爛之台維斯盃、究將誰屬、已成問題、明日兩組單打、鮑羅脫拉對愛律森、柯顯對梵恩斯、但鮑氏昨日與梵恩斯大戰後、今晚尙休息復原、而柯顯今日雙打中、球術又未盡善、大抵明日與梵恩斯相遇時、柯顯不能取勝、而僅能盡力支持、以求保全令譽而已、如欲法國之得勝、則鮑羅脫拉球術如何、實爲最要問題今日雙打四人中允推勃魯尼翁爲最佳、餘則遠出其後云、</p>
<p>（三）兩塲表演比賽</p>
<p>馬迪夫人大顯身手</p>
<p>巴黎電三十日台維斯盃雙打比賽終結後、另有雙打表演賽、以娛觀衆、一方爲馬迪夫人與蒲塞斯、一方爲邁爾蘭與瑪底歐夫人、結果馬蒲二人以六比三、七比五得勝、另有一組單打表演賽、貝爾那對番萊、貝氏以六比四勝第一盤、但旋因天雨中止比賽云</p>

<h3>中華棒球隊練習賽失敗</h3>
<p>麥令以十一比零勝</p>
<p>中華棒球隊昨與麥令斯乙隊在中華棒球塲作第二次練習比賽四時起賽、共打七局、麥令斯以十一比零凈勝、</p>
<p>雙方實力比較、中華球藝未見純熟、雖有一二健全者、但大體上缺點頗多、昨經充分時間之加工練習、一時不易成爲勁敵、麥令斯技術固佳、然亦非上乘之流、</p>
<p>中華隊所受最大之傷痕致一蹶不振者、在第五局之損失八分、其初壁壘森嚴、雖略受打擊、依然生氣勃然、查第五局之慘敗、（一）投手臂力漸顯軟弱、（二）游擊二壘錯誤累見、（三）外翼等不善處置、此外中華善於擊球者不多、於是造成一面式之能守而不能攻矣、各局比分如下、</p>

<p>（六）大會之花絮</p>
<p>紅男綠女儼若花壇、（電通三日洛山磯電）開會式時看台之上、紅男錄女均着美國式之夏裝一望無涯、儼如花壇、　　納米袖手旁觀由看台上、注視選手目不轉晴者、有二人焉一爲因業餘資格問題、停止出塲之芬蘭世界長跑選手納米君、一爲在預賽落選之布哇游泳選手加哈拉莫克君、似已斷念任後進作成新記錄者、</p>

<h3>封鎖聲中東北關稅問題</h3>
<p>日本運動各國貨物　　勿經中國改由日運僞國强奪東北海關、我國中政會議、决將實施封鎖、但以事關重大、財部尙在愼重討論中、而滬地日商、對於此事、已經提出反對、茲經記者詳加調查、爰將所得各方、詳情分記如下、</p>
<p>收稅原則　海關原則、凡外洋貨運赴東三省、須在上海轉船者、貨物進口時有十五天存棧期、如果當塲照進口貨報關納稅、則此貨在轉船往東北時、可憑單將原稅取回、因此貨須到東北關付稅、上海作爲一個通過中岸、不必付稅也、又中國土貨、從上海運往東北者、在出</p>
<p>口時、照例納半稅、到東北時、再納半稅東北海關如果封鎖、凡洋貨之運往東北、而到滬轉船者、海關不作通過口岸論、須照當地進口貨、一律徴收全稅、即土貨出口、亦不收半稅而徴全額、</p>
<p>日商反對　日貨運往東北者、較歐美各國爲多、大部由上海轉裝大連汽船及大阪商輪、至大連營口安東等地、今我封鎖東北、改由進口口岸徴取全稅、則貨到東北時、僞國仍須徴收稅疑、是一貨而付雙稅、日商借口我國收二重稅爲名、而向我提出抗議、並且主張拒付、</p>
<p>運動外貨　歐美貨之往東北者甚多、尤以美國烟葉爲大宗、近日各日商對於各國商行之經過營進出口業者、四出運動、勸令由各國裝赴東三省哈爾濱貨物、勿裝到上海轉船、改運至日本神户、由大阪日郵等特派商輪十六艘、專航大連牛莊安東各埠、以接運洋貨至東北、可免納兩重稅、此事日人活動甚烈、</p>
<p>船鈔問題　向來行駛我國各海口港岸之中外商輪、其船鈔由江海關徴收者、即可通行無阻、分三個月收取一次、每噸收銀四錢、今僞國奪取東北海關後、對於上海等處開往中外各國商輪、擬收噸鈔、此事已在籌辦之中、但記者得聞各外商輪當局、對於僞國徴收船鈔、以各國至今尙未承認僞國、故於徴取船鈔、絕對拒絕不付、此事將引起國際之反抗也、</p>
<p>停付賠欵　新聲社云、關於停付日本部分之庚子賠欵事、據外交界消息、財長宋子文、雖已有正式之聲明、但現尙未經過外交方面之手續、由外部照會日本通知、故此時尙難觀察日方之態度、究爲如何、但按事實而觀、財部自東北關稅被攫後、全國各關收入奇絀、對於各國以關稅爲抵押之借欵、尙擬减成償還、而對於直接攫奪東北關稅者、自當有停付可能、日本抗議與否、雖不得而知、然日方恐以爲我國將以（日本破壞國際協定扣留中國政府抵付外債與賠欵之東北關稅）爲理由而停付、至關稅方面、報載所謂（二重稅）者、官方不以此爲然、蓋政府何時實行封鎖、現尙不得而知、即實行封鎖時、所謂（二重稅）者、係東北僞組織之非法舉動也、各國并未承認僞國、自當以我方所徴收之出入口稅爲合法、所謂（二重稅）者、實日方之反宣傳耳、</p>
<h3>今日全市特别戒嚴</h3>
<p>華租交界鐵門暫行緊閉　　禁止一切集會結社游行今日（八一）爲國際運動紀念日、華租當局、事前得密報共黨屈時將舉行示威運動、决定宣告特别戒嚴、嚴予制止、以維治安、各情分誌如下、</p>
<p>禁止集會游行　市公安局長溫應星、以本市現在尙未解嚴、凡未經地方主管官署核准之集會結社游行、均在禁止之例、况今日爲（八一）紀念日、深恐共黨乘機搗亂、特令各區警署曁各分所、屈時警士一律武裝出防、各要道雙崗、并飭督察處全體督察員、一律率領警察大隊警士、曁女校檢查員、出發檢查行人、偵察隊一律出發偵查、同時宣告特别戒嚴、嚴厲防範、以維地方治安、</p>

<h3>市府邀記者參觀海水浴塲</h3>
<p>并觀市輸渡管理處</p>
<p>本市公用局、應市民之需要、特於浦東高橋海濱設海水浴塲、以便市民於夏日前往游泳、該浴塲雖限於市政經費之拮据、未能立即設備完善、本年度之應急計劃、則已次第實行、第一步工作、業已進行完畢、如修葺道路·建築飲食處·更衣室·設置篷帳·等、均經實現、至於大規模之計劃、如建築游泳場與道路等、一俟經費有着、即行鳩工從事、昨日市政府特柬邀各報·各通訊社、記者前往參觀、由市政府代表陳克成、陳訓畬·市公用局第四科長譚伯英·等担任招待、上午八時四十五分、各記者陸續到集、共五十餘人、當即登第三號公用局渡輪、九時起椗北駛、十時二十分抵高橋輪埠、登岸後、先分乘公共汽車二輛、駛往高橋鎭車站、換乘由市府先雇定之人力車、赴海水浴場、</p>
<h3>各記者試浴</h3>
<p>十一時三十分、齊集海水浴場、由市府代表等招待各記者入飲食處、欵以茶點、茶點畢、由譚科長領導參觀一周、記者中之善游泳者、遂紛穿場内備有之浴衣、入水試浴、興趣盎然、浴場設備、已粗具規模、水灘上蓋有可容百人之飲食處一間、設有桌椅、備有冷食糕點等食品、供游泳者解飢渴、旁築更衣室凡十間、供游泳者更換衣著及儲藏衣服之用、此外製就之篷帳甚多、游泳者可向管理處借用、設備堪稱完美也、</p>
<h3>東溝進午餐</h3>
<p>徘徊約一小時半、乃魚貫離塲、乘車返高、一時四十分搭輪赴東、溝、二時抵東溝登岸、赴市輪渡總管理處、事前公用局已於總管理處設置筵席、預備宴請記者、各記者略事休息、卽入席、席上市府代表陳克成氏起立致辭、略謂、今日招待各位記者先生參觀海</p>
<p>水浴場、承蒙翩然蒞止、不辭跋涉、實深榮幸、惟招待不周、殊爲抱歉、甚盼原諒云云、繼由陳氏介紹公用局第四科長譚伯英氏報告開闢海水浴場之經過與今後之計劃、并報告市輪渡業務狀况等甚詳、茲記其講詞如後、</p>
<h3>譚伯英報告</h3>
<p>市公用局交通科科長譚伯英氏、於席半起立致歡迎詞、並詳述建設海濱浴塲市輪渡之經過、略云、今日承諸君不辭辛勞、不避酷暑、長途跋涉、前來參觀海濱浴塲、致稱榮幸、本局籌備粗陋、招待不週、幸望原諒、並祈指導、今日所參觀之海濱浴塲、初爲</p>
<h3>外人所發現</h3>
<p>緣該塲位僻於浦東高橋之東北面、平涉一片、光滑異常、由淺入深、與海水成傾斜面、實一天然之游泳塲所、而爲滬上人士、多未加注意、迨外人春夏之交、漁獵於此、始發現此地、於是每値盛夏、必成羣結隊、架栅設帳、游息於此、本局因鑒外人來浦者日衆、初未知其目的的何在、因異而追踪、窺其究竟、始</p>
<p>知原委、</p>
<h3>建築之經過</h3>
<p>本局旣見本市有此天然勝地、自應加以建設、成一良好之游泳塲、以爲本市民衆鍛鍊身體之所、故决然計劃建築、去年卽將此項計劃、呈請市政府批核、當由張市長核准、但因經費無着、仍無從進行、嗣後吳市長接視後、卽允於市輪渡盈餘項下、撥出二千元先事籌建、正擬鳩工建造、忽中日事起、遂復停止、迨本月中旬、始鳩一構築栅屋數間、闢更衣室·儲藏室·酒排間·等、以爲游泳者飲食休息更衣之所、並豎立深度木杆、標明水之深淺、俾游泳者避免危險、更雇有救護員數人、遇發生不幸時、立時出發救護、凡此種種、均於半月内完成、雖規模粗具、但游客已稱便不少、而有二千元之經費、猶未完全用去、</p>
<h3>將來之計劃</h3>
<p>該塲初步工作、雖已完成、但吾人决不以此自滿、蓋該塲僻處高橋之東北離輪渡約有七八里之譜、若循現有之道曲折而行、異常不便、乘坐人力車、需費至一元之鉅、故决加築一直達該塲之馬路、約可省行四里許、將由公共汽車來回駛行、以便旅客、他如警衛方面、將請公安局增加警士、特派員吏、以資保衛、衛生方面、亦將取締小販不潔及隔宿食物、而浴塲亦將增設救護器具及跳板等、至進行時所有種種阻力或無知人士之無理取閙、决不顧慮、以冀爲市民增一鍛鍊身體高尙娱樂所、</p>
<h3>改輪之經過</h3>
<p>市政府原有渡輪之起原、係當市政府成立之初、接辦塘工善後工局移交小輪三艘、駛行車溝與上海間、十六年前該項渡輪由朱福田先生主持、迨市府接收後、卽矢意改良、因全體員工之刻苦耐勞及用煤耗料之節省、得年有盈餘、迨輪渡經費獨立後、乃向外人借欵建造東溝碼頭、及一二兩號新輪、新船行駛後、經一年許、卽將盈餘完全還清借欵、復向市銀行借三十六萬元、建造三號·四號·兩輪及十六舖對江渡輪等數號、又於高橋建築新式碼頭現已歸還市銀行十四萬、尙餘十二萬、約於明年三月間可以還清、則市輪全部財物、將有七十餘萬之譜、此皆賴全體員工同心一德刻苦耐勞、所創造而來者也、</p>
<h3>晚專輪返滬</h3>

<h3>炊飯的考證</h3>
<p>— 瞻盧</p>
<p>蒸熱的飯，盛在木桶裏賣給人家做點心··費錢不多，卻可以博得一飽，確是平民社會中的糧臺·，這種生涯，喚做賣癡飯。</p>
<p>癡飯的癡字，當然不是這個字，一定是訛稱的·，有人校正名稱，說是煮飯，又說是糦飯·，我說··都不對。癡飯的原名，祇是炊飯罷了。</p>
<p>蘇滬一帶的人，把風吹的吹字，大槪喚做凝癡字··炊飯的炊字，和吹字同音，奸麽炊飯喚做癡飯，這是一定不移的道理。若說，明明是蒸飯，爲什麽不喚蒸飯而喚炊飯？解决這個問題，是和北宋的歷史有關的··我且引出兩條宋人筆記做考證··一、靑箱雜記上說··｜仁宗廟諱徴字，其音近蒸，内廷上下不敢呼蒸字，呼蒸餅爲炊餅。</p>
<p>二、伊川先生語錄上說··｜仁宗時，宮嬪呼正月爲始月，蒸餅爲炊餅。爲着避宋諱，把蒸餅喚做炊餅。｜武大所賣炊餅，也祗是蒸餅，並非爐内所烘的燒餅，俗稱武大郎賣燒餅，這是相沿之訛，水滸傳上祗說賣炊餅。｜那麽蒸飯喚做炊飯，當然也是北宋傳下的習慣了。</p>
<p>我們可以知道··宋仁宗以前，賣蒸飯的，祗喚賣蒸飯··爲着避宋諱，才喚賣炊飯，爲着經了蘇滬土音的變化，才喚賣癡飯。唉··這隻飯桶裏的東西，也是三换名稱咧！</p>

<p>夕陽歸去，微風輕拂，農人們一肩鉏鏟，都賦（歸歟·）這時候，如其吾們有興，那没，豆棚下正好席地而坐，什麽都無恐·什麽都說到··自然囉｜農夫們對於此次（打仗）是始終作爲談話中心的·</p>
<p>鄕下人思想簡單，說話也來得直率·他們不懂說話有藝術和技巧，提到某要人，他們不客氣地要駡他（烏龜），同樣，一說到十九路軍時，一天的辛苦疲勞，者會像烟消雲散，固然，他們自動地替軍隊掘濠溝是曾經有了軍民團結的融洽精神的，然而由此，吾們自到政府是怎樣的不善利用民族精神而放棄吾們？　滬戰的軼聞，已經充分地被文人收拾去·可是吾覺得，以草野的農夫之立塲體騐到的還少，因爲之作補遺··</p>
<p>誰都知道，十九路軍的總退守是値得痛哭的，然而誰也不曾想到一部分軍士始終没有退·這是事實，閘北以西的失地裏，吾軍間諜未嘗離敵軍一步，只是服裝換了，那時，在田野間工作的農人隊伍中，十個倒有八個是軍人，他們有槍，有彈，也有手溜彈·，蘊藏得誰也找不着，他們和眞的農夫們站在一條線上，等待機會來到，作内在的爆發，可是後來上海香檳酒高舉，第二次大戰並没發動，十九軍的神機妙算，因之終於没有震蕩世界·以軍事學湛深自誇的日本，僅僅是一隻紙老虎是證實了·</p>

<h3>雞蛋直揑何以揑不碎</h3>
<p>— 高潛</p>
<p>雞蛋直揑並非絕對的揑不碎。不過要把他順直的揑碎了。非有很大的力氣不可。</p>
<p>其所以難碎的原因。是由於蛋殼的形式很爲特别。雞蛋殼我們可以看作是許多小圓供造成的。大凡供圈越窄越高。他的抵抗力也越强大。供圈越寛越低。他的抵抗力也越薄弱。</p>
<p>我們現在看看雞蛋。當我們從兩旁揑去時。他的形狀是兩個很寛很低的供圈合在一起。所以抵抗力最爲薄弱。當我們從兩頭揑去時。他的形狀便是兩個很窄很高的供圈。合在一瑰。所以抵抗力異常强大。</p>
<p>這就是雞蛋直揑難得揑碎的原因。</p>
<p>他們把食物給鄕下人吃，即使是已經腐爛了，也只能夠立時嚥下去，否則，哼｜槍尖亮着呢｜</p>
<p>失地時比在打的時候苦得多，看見東洋兵，一不能笑，二不能不笑，三不能走得快，也不能走得不快，總之，不走最好·守譙樓的阿三，因之接連地挨了四次把掌，至今談虎色變的鄕下人不知道失地下的人不能再自比於人，他們以爲如此是犯了東洋兵的忌·</p>
<h3>在外灘公園中</h3>
<p>— 秋郎</p>
<p>若不是這驕陽似火汗下如雨的，鬱悶的長畫，誰又能理會到那適體清風怡情皓月的寳貴的良夜！</p>
<p>我也不能例外，到工作完畢了，晚飯吃過了，偕着幾個同事，向外灘公園奔去，目的是去納凉，但是不能不使我感觸到故鄕｜西子湖｜夏夜的景色，是多麽的美妙！現在賜給我的只有追憶，悵惘！</p>
<p>很久人認外灘公園是肉的公園，我却不敢加以妄評，但是奇裝怪樣的伊們和他們，果然着實不少！這就是摩登男子和摩登女子嗎？我又慚愧地不能加以斷定。</p>
<p>因爲人多的原故，故感到坐椅的缺乏，只是早去的佔着優先權，可是我們的兩條腿，早要求要休息五分鐘了，於是急切地找，終於使我們發覺了新大陸，｜草地｜瞧見老的，少的，男的。女的，都仿效古法席地而坐，彷彿在開一個盛大的會似的，我們也很歡欣的加入了，我將前後左右的人們的舉動，靜默地談話的，歌唱的，猜拳的，戲謔的，吃食的，看書的，而且各人姿勢也不同，斜倚的，蹲着的，危坐的，躺下的，這正符合［睡在大自然的懷裏］的一句話，更有那一雙情侶，並肩的坐着，貼得緊緊的，正在喁喁的情話，一回兒他的口貼近伊的耳鼓子，伊把頭低垂得要接獨胸部，始終没有表示，這樣香艷神秘的一幕，不是求愛是什麽？啊！怎不使人由羨艷而嫉妬呀。</p>
<p>光陰的輪子，是不停地向前推進，海關大鐘噹噹的打了十二下，我們才展開步伐回去。</p>
<h3>鴻廬讀畫記</h3>
<p>— 許士騏</p>
<p>近人之治國畫者。非一味幕古。刻劃形骸。即信筆塗鴉。漫無法度·欲求體會自然。盡物之性。而運筆撥墨。獨出機抒。以發揮性靈者·實不易覯。此國畫之所以日就式微。而一蹶不振也·休沐之日。造訪悲鴻先生於其寓廬。得觀近作。縱横揮灑。奕奕有神。起近代國畫之衰。矯頽靡不振之弊。嘆觀止矣。</p>
<p>［湖邊素羽］一幀。用筆簡勁·傅色典麗。搆成特殊風格。［不堪回首］。託生物形態。以寫感慨悲壯之情。至爲深刻。［奔馬］橫幅。筆酣墨飽。躍然紙上。題句云·［此去天涯將焉託。傷心競爽亦徒然］。表現無限抑鬰。狀雄雞之最精者。有［側身長顧求其羣］。［雄雞一聲天下白］。感時傷物。筆墨淋漓。如英雄俊彦。卓塋不羣。國難期中。尤多傑搆。所謂愈窮則愈工者非耶。［懶貓］一幀。刻劃國人醉生夢死。昏憤冥頑。精警確切。妙到秋毫。憶其題句云。［向日好低首。團　有愧情］。附註云。［國人喜夸大。頻亡矣。猶自日醒獅。實懶貓耳。二十世紀益登峯造極。駸駸乎欲凌駕馬來天民。奈其命不如也·謹窮其狀。庶幾他日不及見也］。寥寥數筆。寫盡激昻沉鬱悲憤之氣。洵爲傑作。人爭寳之綜觀悲鴻之作。雍容瑰麗。磅礴奔放。如萬壑爭流。浩瀚千里。若黃鐘大呂。響壓行雲。令觀者有雋永悠久之印象。</p>
<h3>揚子江上的意象畫</h3>
<p>— 沙洲</p>
<p>（三）蕪湖的乞丐</p>
<p>夕陽在楊子的深碧波水裏劃着金線，我們的船已靠着蕪湖的岸邊，俊俏的建築聳矗着俊俏的崖尖，秀研的丘陵是適當地倒伏着，一切都在淳厚的晚陽的的流金中沉醉了。照例，在船埠上有着旅客們的上下。</p>
<p>在左邊的船邊下，團聚着叫喊着飢餓的乞丐之羣，他們有的是上了年紀的老人和産婦同嬰孩，將沉的小舟與大號的木盆做他們從岸邊到達船旁的工具，帶着哭聲，帶着哀碲，熙攘地求乞於船上的乘客，飢餓的眼睛注望着頭等艙裏的客人，［你客人修福修壽修子孫吧］！於是慈悲的婦人撒下幾枚銅板。［小姐太太給錢我買米吧］！於是愛出風頭的摩登姑娘丢下一個香烟屁股，接着被這悽厲的叫喊所深感的人以及表同情於他們的人都給了一點錢，老頭兒的木盆小，給他的錢全都掉落在水裏了，滿臉的苦笑說明了他内心的懊傷，有錢的太太給他五個銅板，可是兩個落了水，三個又從他頭上跳到别人的小舟裏去了。</p>
<p>船開的時候，乞丐們也走了，當一個木盆裏坐着的姑娘掀起紮頭布的時候，我們瞧見烏黑的頭髮上插着兩朶白蘭花，這時有錢的太太和小姐們全都走進艙房去了，嘴是撅是撅得高高的。　　（四）江上的夜晚</p>
<p>入夜，江風特别凉爽，人是被他吹懶了。蕪湖早已丢在後邊，祇留下幾點閃爍的燈火在水平線上，幾乎像天底　着鬼眼的微星，在没有留意間，團　的月亮又悄悄地探頭出了雲帷，白凈的臉蛋兒上，這時浮着澄黃色的羞暈，好像没有勇氣抬頭似的。</p>
<p>少間，月亮升高了許多，坐在船舷邊的人們，全都浴着月光在沉默着，似在盡情地享受這銀一樣月光的賜給。可是那年輕的流浪人喲！都在憑欄流淚了。</p>
<p>兩岸的山嶺和長帶般無盡止的漫延着，富有擾動　的波曲線，清晰地刻劃在灰暗的天際，浩森的楊子江的流波上喲，正擁戴着十萬條銀帆在奔突着，浪花在飛濺，巨波在怒吼，東方疾病的憂鬱的心情被負托着，你偉大的揚子江喲，我將爲你狂歌着，你宇宙的無限大喲！</p>
<h3>古廟敲鐘（六十一）</h3>
<p>— 不除庭草齋夫</p>
<p>六十人</p>
<p>古廟學校是已經轟轟烈烈的辦了一個多月，門前連一塊牌子也没有。牠不但是校牌没有而且校名也没有定好。有的人喊牠爲古廟學校，有的人喊牠爲古廟學堂，有的人喊牠爲古廟小學，有的人簡直就光頭腦的把牠喊做古廟。牠好一比是個可愛的小孩子没有取名字，和尙尼姑隨人歡喜喊。我心裏想古廟旣是一個學校，總得要掛一塊牌子·，有了牌子，校名自然會統一了。我終於向朱先生請求把校牌寫起來，讓我拿去雕刻油漆。</p>
<p>朱先生說··［這是一個難題。我也曾經想寫一塊校牌，但至今没有想出一個好的名字，如何寫得起來？老實說，古廟不是一個平常所謂之學校。如果是一個學校，那末拿起筆來一揮就成，又有什麽困難？無奈我們在這裏所辦的雖是一個小學堂，但同時是一個小工塲，又是一個小社會。學堂的主要意義是長進··工塲的主要意義是生産··社會的主要意義是平等互助，自衛衛人。工塲與工廠不大相同··凡露天的生産工作如種植，開礦，造路，築橋都包括在内。所以我們這個集團是含有這三種意義。你可以簡稱牠爲三一主義。你還要知道這三種意義是貫澈我們整個集團的生活。牠與平常所謂工讀學校是根本不同。工讀學校是半天做工，半天讀書，工自工，讀自讀，不相聯串。我們這個小小試騐是將工塲，學堂，社會打成一片。我要把牠寫成一個學堂吧便難免失掉生産與社會的意義。我想不稱牠爲學校。古廟工學社和古廟工學團這兩個名字行不行？］</p>
<p>我說··［古廟工學團更合我意。團字含有團結或集團的意義。社字比較寛泛。中國社會之大病就是一盤散沙，惟獨集團的生活可以糾正這毛病並且可以發揮出衆人的力量來。］</p>
<p>朱先生雖然贊成我的選擇，但是他還不肯立刻把牌子寫出來。我看他心裏還有未决的問題。他說··［我們仔細想想，過幾天再寫也不遲。］</p>

<p>（週二）大條回縮零六二五、美銀反升一二五、乃匯兌仍大之關係、先令長一二五、美金隨升二五、内部平平、標金初開小去一兩八錢、計七百四十一兩半、次爲一兩二錢、以後各方均進、午時爲四十六兩、旋由四十五兩一錢收市、下午四十五兩開市、以後四十六兩半、乃志豐永瑞興代喬日夫買進、終以恒興等出售、遂爲四十四兩、至收市四兩六錢、比上日回漲一兩三錢、一日間</p>
<p>中央曾掉進現貨四五百條、</p>

<h3>厘拆均跌形勢衰殆</h3>
<p>昨爲星期日、銀行例假、市場中洋釐早漲午跌、早市爲六錢侂分九釐半、午市爲六錢八分八厘八毫七　半、結果似較前日午市微好一毫二怱半、而形勢終軟、不能站住、銀拆早市及午市均爲六分、做出匯劃票欵早市二十八萬五千、午市二十九萬五千、鈔票祇場外早市五萬、午市槪無交易、拆票交易六百萬光景、錢莊洋公單收解五百七十餘萬、銀公單收解二千七百餘萬、各路滙欵四十餘萬、輔幣江南小洋早午市同爲五錢九分九釐、交易祇早市三千角、廣東小洋早午市亦同爲五錢八分四厘、交易早市七萬角、午市一萬五千角、銅元仍爲四百三十千文、交易五萬零三百餘千文、</p>
<h3>七月份銀根底堅</h3>
<p>七月份之銀拆、每日以一錢左右時佔居多日、然一錢關内之時、復佔多數、故全月銀拆市價、統計額不及三兩、爲二兩九錢、而以三十一天扯計、平均每天爲九分三厘五毫五之譜、較六月份似略轉優、但明日之常會存息、議决案約在三兩九五扣之間云、</p>
<h3>證劵　交割前後債市週訊</h3>
<p>環象惡劣價下降甚鉅　　成交一千九百餘萬元　　上星期（自七月念五至卅日）本埠華商證劵交易所市場成交情形、現貨每日進出極稀、全週祇開出七萬三千五百元、中除一九關二萬五千元、二○捲一萬六千元、其他槪僅數千元、期貸亦不及前、除週五以交割停市、内以週初兩日及週末一日約各有五百萬、週四計四百九十萬、週三祗一百五十餘萬元、又七月期貸祇週初兩日交易、週三起卽以準備交割停市、而九月期雖於週四開盤、但成交極稀、故全週交易惟八月期貨獨多統計全週各債劵成交總數一千九百十七萬五千元、比前週實减八百九十餘萬元、内鹽稅較多、佔四百四十二萬、分七月期九十八萬五千元、八月期三百四十三萬元、九月期五千元、餘如統稅七月期五十六萬、八月期二百十三萬、二○關七月期七十九萬、八月期一百六十九萬五千元、裁兵七月期三十一萬五千元、八月期二百零四萬五千、二○捲七月期六十萬、八月期一百四十萬、一九善七月期三十八萬、八月期一百三十九萬、一九關七月期四十八萬五千元、八月期一百三十五萬五千元、其他較清、如編遣七月期三十五萬、八月期四十八萬、關稅七月期八萬、八月期十四萬、整理六厘七月期七萬、八月期念萬元、九六計七月期十萬、八月期十一萬、金融無市、</p>
<p>至若上星期内各債劵價之變動情形、則爲時在月底交割期内、市面本較冷淡、且復爲環象不良、市上多屬零户交易、大户進出殊稀、故呈供過於求、價亦甚疲、如於週一計小三四角至一元餘不等、週二上落在半元左右、週三復小五六角、週四仍續下跌、至交割後之週末一日、下降尤烈、蓋因内外環象惡化、以是人心甚虚、市上賣多買少、故各價飛降一元至二元半不等、結果較前星期除七月期以祇週初兩日市面、不能計眞確之漲跌外、而八月期貨下降多達三四元、察債劵市之前途、現雖未易測知其變化、但時局形勢之愈呈嚴重、而大災之後、市面蕭條、稅收銳减、國家財政困難、其前途誠未許樂觀也、茲將上週内各債劵價之高低漲落情形分列如下表、（單位元）</p>

<h3>紗花　多空控制下之</h3>
<p>上週間標紗</p>
<p>棉紗市况在上週簡頗呈盤旋之局、因實需較滯、不若前日之暢、人心萎挫、市勢較軟、然各帮大量採辦之後、應有一度清澹、各廠現貨均已抽空、　積全無、因此廠方心思堅昻、銀根方面大爲寛舒、對於現紗之價、不願鬆售、惟期貨市場有大户抛出、探其意以世界紗市仍在不量氣中、面南埠各方購去現貨包額已屬不少、深恐一度久長停頓、所以傾向做空、至於榮興買方鑒於國内今庚雨水調匀、揚子江流域一帶田稻可卜豐收、預料農民需要可旺、兼之四處地頭底貨奇枯、逢跌時仍吸進做多、但多空兩方皆有相當的力量、不過依大勢論之、棉紗五十兩之價、暫時有立定可能性、一以美棉形勢平平、雖無大漲風、然亦未有跌落之狀、二則存貨較前爲枯、故生意如果再繼續而來、當然有趨高之望、不過日軍侵略熱河政策仍在積極進行中、影響殊不淺矣、標紗市價以拒貨行動、忽升忽降、人心不一、結果各月價比上週跌六錢至二兩一錢、全週成交統計二十萬零九千七百包、客帮現紗買去統計九千零五十五包、行情比前週跌一二兩不等、茲將各帮口買去之額量、分列如下、</p>

<h3>凡勒拉指導國人屏除奢侈娛樂</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>昨據路透社杜白林電，今日有衆萬人，集於杜白林格林學院，歡迎自由邦領袖凡勒拉，凡氏今日開始其全國宣傳，以指導國難中國人之行動，凡氏稱國人宜勿事惶擾，用錢宜適當，奢侈娛樂，皆須屏除，而迅速應付其金融義務，　　我國人其聽者，這是英國人凡勒拉之言，這是愛爾蘭自由邦領袖在國難中指導國人之言，使現在知道一般國人的</p>
<p>心理，凡是中國人的話，無論其所說有怎樣價値，總是不肯相信的，就是聖經賢傳的話，亦早認爲腐朽迂闊而不合於世界的潮流，現在以上所說的話，是外國人的話，是自由邦領袖的話，應該値得注意了·</p>
<p>假定以上的話而出於不侒的口麽，不是笑我守錢奴的腦筯，便是笑我做候補的資本家，因爲我到底是個中國人，中國人的話，完全没有價値的，上邊是自由邦領袖的話，那値得介紹了，英國的生産落後，决不致於像我國麽？英國的民窮財盡，决不致於像我國麽？英國之所謂國難，更决不致於像我國麽？然而自由邦領袖凡勒拉開始全國宣傳之言曰·［用錢宜適當，奢侈娛樂宜屏除，］試問我國現在的情形，比較英國如何，失業的人口日衆，而奢侈的程度日高，生産折機會日微，而生活的慾望日熾，無錢者終日旁苦而不得一飽，有錢者窮奢極欲，揮霍無度，此種畸形的發展，尙何有求濟的希望呢？</p>
<p>此中原因，决有三端，一種　　繩樞之子，驟膺顯位，必定要享盡人問幸福而後快，所謂貧兒暴富。手無所措是也，一種國家前途如何，尙不可問，［今朝有酒今朝醉，明日無錢明日愁，］樂得取快一時，决不替明日打算，一種大丈夫生不五鼎食，死則五鼎烹，大家舍正路而不由，去尋覓一躍而爲陞官發財的終南捷徑，此種心理，亡國有餘，自辛亥革命以來，頗染此種風氣，在民二梁任公［革命相續的原理］一文中，就有這樣類似的話，一致現在，程度更高·</p>
<p>中國可亡的心理尙多，而提倡奢侈，不治生産，亦爲其中的要素，若要革除此風氣，非在上者先自提倡，以身作則不可，而國人亦應於良心上根本覺悟，力自撙節，昨日凡勒拉的話，雖是針砭英國國民的病根，我想這張藥方，若拿來醫治中國人民的毛病，更是一服對病的良藥呢·</p>

<h3>有聲電影</h3>
<p>— 夢</p>
<p>自上海大光明，首先開映有聲電影以來，現在已風行一時了。當初發明的時候，只有在歌舞時有聲·後來逐漸發明，局部改良，利用電，光，音，的互相變化，纔成今日維妙維肖的有聲電影。但是有聲電影怎樣會發音，恐怕看過的，也不能十分明白。因此我把發明的程序，和所以能發音的原理，述諸於下。諒亦讀者所樂聞也。</p>
<p>（一）最初的有聲電影｜不過爲電影機和留聲機的連絡工作。當在攝影片時，同時以留聲機收音。其片與不常唱片亦無異，惟直徑較大，可供較長時間的歌唱。於影片及聲片上，各有起點。在開映時，搖動影片·同時因槓桿的連絡，留聲機亦開始旋轉。因影片與聲片之速度有一定之比例，（通常影片每分鐘一百英尺，聲片三分鐘一百轉。）故聲與影完全互相符合。但此種裝置，只適用於連續不斷的歌舞。若起點弄錯，則聲與影更無法符合。更且發音在看衆背後，不能同銀幕上如出一口。凡此種種缺點，故已淘汰不用了。</p>
<p>（二）過度時期之有聲電影｜維太風（Vitaphone）｜維太風的結構，同上相妨··不過用電把聲音傳至幕後。當聲片轉動時，因針頭的振動，發生强弱不同的電流，通到幕後，經眞空管的擴大，在幕後之喇叭中放出。幕上史有許多小孔，蓋使其音類似出於劇中人之口吻。機内又裝設减聲機，以减去由針頭與音片磨擦之嘈雜聲。</p>
<p>（三）現在的有聲電影｜慕維通（Movieton）｜因音與光變換的發明，因此有聲電影也圓滿地造成了。在攝影的時候，由電的作用，把聲音的波浪變成疎密强弱不同的光波·由攝影機攝入。其形狀爲黑白相間的條紋，有疎，有密。這種音波的片子，附着在影片的旁邊。在開映時候，光線射過影片，同時也射過聲帶，而達光電器上（Pgoto　electric　cell）。使其還原而成音浪。此種類似大燈泡之光電器，能依受光之强弱，而發生大小不同之電流，再經督空管之擴大器，而達台後之喇叭而放出。</p>
<p>現在的有聲電影，都是第三種。原理是非常簡單，但是由音變光，由光變音，的二個光電器的製造，却非常複雜。這個光電器共分三層，三層爲氫氧化鉀，一層爲金屬（Ａctive　metal）。但究竟怎樣製造，發明者現在還守着秘密呢。</p>
<h3>改良社會討論會</h3>
<h3>改良吃飯</h3>
<p>— 怡怡館主</p>
<p>讀者諸君，見了我這個［改良吃飯］的題目，定要奇怪，以爲人生吃飯，如何也好改良呢？且聽在下說明如下，</p>
<p>不對　請不吝賜敎。</p>
<p>我國人吃飯，素來行的是［共食主義］，什麽是［共食主義］？就是一碗裏，盛滿了菜肴，供幾個人你一箸來我一箸去的共向這一隻碗内　着取食，這就敎做［共食主義］，這［共食主義］，在我國内各處，風行已久，安治無事，但是細想起來，很是危險｜極有改良的必要。因爲幾個人共吃一碗菜，或是一碗湯，經過多次大家的箸和匙的掏洗，這碗菜，或是湯，就得在無形中加上許多唾沬，如果這幾個人之中，有一個是患肺癆病的，或是其它的傳染病的，那末，他的病菌，難免不從他的箸上，或湯匙上，傳播到菜肴裏，其他幾個康健的人，吃了這染有病菌的菜肴，就要發生危險了！所以歐美各國，是行的［分食主義］。他們進餐，雖有幾個人共桌，但是吃的湯菜，却是每人每的，無非是這個講究啊。</p>
<p>我以爲年來我國人，事事歐化，那末，這個吃飯事情，也何不改良歐化呢？或者每人備具二副箸匙，一以取菜，一以取食，不過如此，容易纒錯，而且麻煩，不如菜肴每人每的來得簡便，而且經濟，因爲［共食主義］的菜肴往往十幾樣。一桌擺滿，如果眞能實行［分食主義］，每人每的至多也不過一湯一菜，適合一人之量爲度，旣合衛生，又是經濟，大家何樂而不爲呢？</p>
<h3>答改良社會討論會</h3>
<p>— 程鵬</p>
<p>對於改良男子服式的討論附帶建議改良女子短褲，二十一年七月二十五日，見懷靜誠君在申報上發表對改良男女服裝的建議，他的意思約分兩點，</p>
<p>一、男子拖泥帶水的長衫要改良，但是西裝太麻煩太貴族化，主張上身穿學生裝，下生穿短褲可以減熱，</p>
<p>二、女子不宜穿絲襪短褲，因爲（甲）褲子短絲襪薄，冬季不能禦寒，（乙）有礙風化，引誘靑年誤入岐途，　　我是一個軍人，本不配談社會學，更不敢加入討論改良社會問題，不過旣有賢哲要改良現有的惡社會，亦不妨以愚見供識者一哂，故將靜誠君之上述各點舉以商榷，幸明達埀敎焉，</p>
<p>歐美各國的工農，無不穿西裝，叫化子亦是穿西裝，我不懂懷君何意稱之謂貴族化，日本中學生等因經濟關係，多穿布料西裝，其價値未必甚貴，是恐未必貴族化，穿西裝時，一褲一衣打一結，似不甚麻煩，白麻布衣褲，亦不甚熱，若要過求簡單，又過於長熱，胡不學南非黑人一絲不掛，則凉快程度似又遠勝短褲矣，學生裝原是軍服變相，日本維新徴兵後，日人穿慣軍服，學得較和服便利，故退伍後仍用他料仿製之，學生則因經濟關係，亦多穿着之，惟有職業者，因儀節關係，多穿西裝，社會組合，本不上學生一階級，上公辦事，拜友謁客，自有　禮，上身一件學生服，下身一條短管褲，成何體統，歐美武將則戎裝佩劍，文官則高冠尾服，即商店經理亦禮服辦公，所以昭愼重而表國民之丰度，洛桑會議，蘇俄的共産代表亦穿着禮服，則禮之不可廢也共産黨亦知之，美報記者往見蔣總司令，時蔣氏適穿中山裝，該記者登載談話中，謂蔣氏裝束酷似似咖啡館之侍者，蓋美人之重視儀禮也如此，中國古化，本峨冠博帶，行禮有服。現化已不能用，清代之長袍馬掛亦非國産，民國以來，並未創製新服，祇有暫穿西裝，我以爲中國人現有怪樣子已經很夠十足，儘不可必創新花樣了，女子的褲短襪薄，冬季不能禦寒一層，我想可以不必過慮，因爲女子大衣的長度，儘夠保住溫度了，醫師言，兩腿凉不壞，中國的氣候本無亞拉斯加的冷，毋須抄老學究的四褲全書，（絨褲襯褲綿褲套褲一齊穿）腿大如柱似不雅觀，</p>
<p>女子的大腿公開於外，有礙風化，引誘靑年誤入岐途一層，這是富於意淫的人的論斷，西哲亞那島勒法郎斯Ａnatole　Frence說，［風俗本無壞意，奈人要去想壞何Iln,y　a　pas　de　mal　danses　moeurs　c,est　parce　pue　L,bomeve，］倫敦柏林公園内的人體像，難道多是政府鼓勵人民去賣淫的麽，我以爲一個民族最大恥辱，是祇知淫，不知美，殆終脫不了原始民族的氣味，假定一見兩條大腿就要被他誘惑，則或不幸而見了他媽媽的兩只大腿，又何以處理呢現代靑年之誤入岐途，倒底是他自誤呢，還是大腿誤了他呢，則明達者自有公　，（不受酬）</p>
<p>性的問題</p>
<h3>寡婦再醮的一份通告</h3>
<p>— Ｍ女士</p>
<p>昨天在本欄内，看到士志君報告的一篇關於再醮的事情，見了之後，似乎和我所知道的相同，不過士志君尙没有把她在再醮前的一份通告錄下，現在我特地介紹在下，見後更可知一個受過高等敎育的寡婦，而爲性的需求，更爲金錢的戀迷，就做出這椿乞人憐的事來了，其實在法的立塲上，她竟可自由再醮，又何必要有這樣的聲明呢，她的通告如下，</p>
<p>某某先生··我們非常覺得靦覥向你通告這句話｜我們現在結合了，很知道許多好友們之中，特别爲了關切的原因，會發出不滿的批評·固然·凡事應該適當其分·適當的，便是美是善·否則便是不必要的·我們也擔心着我們的結合，或許已過了分·</p>
<p>我們應當聲明··我們的初意，和現在的行爲是矛盾的·因此不得不將經過情形一述·</p>
<p>講到我們的相稔·還在六七年前，友誼是很久的·去年爲了戚友遺孤的敎育問題，彼此同爲道義上的責任觀念驅使着，很熱忱的共同盡力·到了秋間，忽然宿疾復發，爲了擔憂和照顧的原因，不時的常常謀面·我身體如是脆弱，環境自然苦悶，在知已間慰問慇懃，同實上很是平淡舞奇，而且自信也没有可以受人指摘的地方·</p>
<p>寒假期内，我返鄕，當時身體尙未復原·一二八之變，我受鉅額的損害，幾於生命不保，信問滯遲·彼此異常關切·更爲了急要知道兩方的情狀，心内非常焦灼，來往的信，自然比較的多·於是家人頓然起了猜疑，將信件私拆藏匿，揚言驅逐·我一再辯白·一再質問·因爲自信無他·所以辯白，并且拆信等等舉動，是侵我自由，所以去質要挾而知家人的對我，食言狡辯，强詞問。</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>·遷延到四五個月，终覺没有誠意·簡單的說·自然他們另有用意·　　至於被私拆的信呢，字句雖然不能全記得·但都是殷殷問詢，十分關切的言詞而已·不過因爲連續寄發的原因，他們便據爲口實，而且强說他們是有權可以拆視的·</p>
<p>六七年來，我謹守範圍，不涉他想，原因是··親人骨肉，在短短的時期内，喪亡殆盡，一身遭受，慘痛已極·</p>
<p>居常自想，此生此世，僅如做一塲惡夢，此後但願不添煩惱，何必再墮魔障·此其一·又個人舊禮敎觀念尙深，知道鄕僻之地不比通都大邑，實在不忍看人家有亡兒并失婦之感·此其二·要知我的愛清潔，愛貞白，是出於我個人的自願，并且是絕對自由的·若然爲了怕人家議論的緣故，這便失了我原望的意義·若然說有强制的勢力，使我不得不如此做，這便更不或話說了·本來呢，他們用如此手段來對待我，我很可以乾脆地宣告脫離了便完結，何必要多費唇舌，去辯白去質問，但我確實不願將我的環境更換，所以一再容忍，俾得他們諒解，仍舊照常地過日子·誰知道他們頭腦固然冬烘，手段尤其毒辣·到底給了我一個絕望·我很明白·如果我過於委曲的去求諒解，一則顯得我似乎有些虚心，我當然不願·一則如要再和他們在一處過日子，也是十分没味的·</p>
<p>人家說··禮敎是吃人的勾留·我想如果眞爲了禮敎問題，犠牲了也還有個名目·現在像我這樣，被那一般陰狠險毒的魔鬼，混帳糊塗的將我的一生，輕輕地葬送了·眞覺着太不値得·所以結果還只好和他們脫離了·</p>
<p>可是我受了這樣深刻的激剌，不免悒悒於心·這幾個月來，東住住西住住，於病後之身，非常有害·雖　也有餬口的技能，但疾病年老，伊誰能免，</p>
<p>煦春看了這個情形·推源　始·默計將來·昔人有云解鈴還是繫鈴人·自也顧不得人家評論·只得求良心上之所安·爲此經了不少的磋商，坦直的表示，和種種方面的安排，我才同意了·我們安敢說這是適當的結合·不過不得不如此做罷了·</p>
<p>我們於此，懇切希求，親愛的好友的同情·并以至敬至誠之意，謝免物質上的賀禮｜Ｋ君Ｍ女士謹啓</p>
<h3>女子描寫</h3>
<p>劇變　明·</p>
<p>一年前的張女士，誰了不知道，是一個撲實而好讀書的女學生呢？她有烏黑的頭髮，蛋圓的面龐，曲線的身段，可是她臉不塗脂抺粉，身不穿華麗衣服，從没有想到畢露她的曲線美··原來她只知道［現在讀書，將來救國，］張女士天資聰明，又孜孜兀兀的用功，所以課業成績的總平均分數，常在九十分以上，已經做過好幾年的免費生了，這也怪不得她的先生們很器重她，就是我也佩服到五體投地。</p>
<p>去年暑假，她畢業ＸＸ女子初中學校，一考而錄敢ＸＸ中學，是男女同學的，我想，看她歷年的成績，一定能夠鶴立鷄羣，把男同學吃　，那知事實，却是不然，這學期的成績單上，大都免强及格，還有兩科，只有五十多分，照我想來，大槪是男校的功課，比較女校要深一些，要緊一些的緣故罷｜</p>
<p>前天我的朋友，從ＸＸ公園回來，帶着一付神氣活現的面孔，好像有什麽新發現似的對我說着··［ＸＸ公園，幽靜爽凉，眞是世外桃源呀｜在綠蔭深處，坐着一對摩登情侶··男的面龐長圓，頭髮平光，西裝革履，漂花無比··女的蛋圓面龐，時裝旗袍，豐滿的乳房·畢露她的曲線美，他倆情話纒綿，你知道那女的是那一個？就是ＸＸ中學的張女士，］我的朋友說得津津有味，不過我始終認爲那女的，决不是張女士，最後我還正式警告他，不要詆毁樸實而好讀書的張女士，這是名譽攸關。</p>
<p>昨天下午，公事完畢，我從公司回去的時候，路過ＸＸ大戲院，恰巧電影映完，一個個·一對對的看客從大門蜂擁的出來，忽然看見一對摩登男女，挽着手的向前走去，他倆的姿態，與前天我朋友說起在ＸＸ公園裏的一對情侶，完全相似，我仔細一望，希奇，那女的正是樸實而好讀書的張女士，那男子好像是她同校的ＸＸ會主席陳ＸＸ。</p>
<p>啊｜讀書救國？還是戀愛救國？</p>
<h3>學堂寫眞</h3>
<p>開辦暑期學校的［三七主義］曼倩·</p>
<p>在昨天我到Ｓ校的暑期學校找一個同學，則踏進佼門，就可以聽到裏面滿城風雨的在談論着什麽開辦暑期學校的［三七主義。］後來一打聽，才知道這主義的發明家就是該校的Ｔ校長，現在我來把牠介紹給本刋的讀者··</p>
<p>所謂［三七主義］牠的解釋就是</p>
<p>第一，暑期學校開辦之後，就能收到一筆很可觀的學費，這筆欵子，是足夠［七［月份的一切開支了，本來的經費，也就可以節省起來··至於是否飽入校長的私囊，或者是爲公家打算，那可不得而知了，</p>
<p>第二，敎員凡被聘請，但任一項課程的，那麽每月就有［七］十塊錢的額外收入！</p>
<p>第三，說是有這樣的規定··凡是暑期學校的學生想投考Ｓ校的，可以有這樣的利益··有你研選的課程，在結束時的成績，祗要在［七］十分以上的，那麽在投考的時候，這幾項就可以免考，</p>
<p>［三七主義］的意思大槪是這樣··我當時聽了，對Ｔ校長這種利已利人的苦心，眞是佩服得五體投地！</p>

<h3>Recent Changes in German Politics</h3>
<p>On the 20th of this month, the German Federal Government abruptly dissolved the Prussian state government by emergency decree of the President. Prime Minister Papen was specially appointed as the state's governor, its constitution was suspended, and Papen's autocratic rule was implemented instead. On the surface, this seems to be a political change only in a part of Germany, but Prussia is the core of Germany, and its changes and movements are enough to affect the whole. Moving one hair affects the whole body, so it cannot be regarded as a change in only one country or one part. Since the Great War, German politics have been in chaos every day. Examining the reasons, it is not entirely due to financial difficulties, but the shaking of the foundation of republican politics is also one of the main reasons. In March of the year before last, the Müller cabinet collapsed due to financial difficulties. The Brüning cabinet succeeded it. At the beginning of his cabinet formation, in order to consolidate the power of the central moderate faction, Brüning repeatedly suppressed the power of the Social Democratic Party. However, after the general election, the National Socialist Party and the Communist Party won great victories. Therefore, Brüning had to change his original intention and win over the opposition Social Democratic Party to contend with them, creating a situation of cooperation between the Center Party and the Social Democratic Party.</p>
<p>Brüning's inclination towards the Social Democratic Party was very unsatisfactory in the eyes of those who advocated national power expansion, and was especially intolerable to President Hindenburg. In the early summer of this year, the Brüning cabinet finally collapsed under environmental pressure. At the end of May, the unknown retired soldier Papen was ordered to form a cabinet. This was a major turning point in German politics and a clear indication of Hindenburg's suppression of the Social Democratic Party. Whether Hindenburg's move was a sin or a merit, let us put it aside for the time being. But in fact, the current domestic situation in Germany is complex. There are national socialist parties, communist parties, national power parties such as the Stahlhelm, and social democratic parties such as the Reichsbanner, as well as many other political organizations. The National Socialist Party and the Communist Party even often use direct violent actions to fight each other. This complicated situation is all a crisis for the future of German politics. The results of the past Prussian general election and the German presidential election show that the National Socialist Party has made great progress, and Hindenburg is also trying to protect them. The recent lifting of the ban on wearing brown uniforms by the National Socialist Party, in fact, means nothing less than tacitly allowing the National Socialist Party to prepare for atrocities. Under this situation, the Communist Party naturally had to resort to a policy of (retaliating with violence) and intensify the conflict between the old and new factions. In the Prussian parliamentary election in April of this year, although the National Socialist Party was the largest party, because it did not have an absolute majority, the premier of the Prussian government was still Braun of the Social Democratic Party. After Papen formed the cabinet, he tried every means to suppress it, withholding funds from the federal government to the Prussian state and closing two major Social Democratic Party newspapers in Berlin. All of this was enough to show the federal government's anti-Social Democratic Party stance and its desire to replace liberalism with authoritarianism. The dissolution of parliament after Papen formed the cabinet and the general dismissal of the Prussian state government cabinet this time were all formed by this political shift.</p>
<p>Prussia occupies the most important position in the German Federation. The realization of Prussian autocratic politics is nothing less than a prelude to the victory of the German National Socialist Party. The rise of the National Socialist Party in the German Federation will inevitably arouse extreme resistance from the Communist Party. The intensification of the future struggle between the National Socialist Party and the Communist Party is likely to cause unprecedented disturbances in Germany. At that time, the government will also take this opportunity to create absolute dictatorship in the whole of Germany under the pretext of suppression. If dictatorship in all of Germany is realized one day, Europe will inevitably experience nervous (fear of Germany) and cause an incredible storm. This is probably what we can expect.</p>

<p>(Beiping) The Beiping Political Affairs Committee issued a declaration on the evening of the 31st. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>The All the members of the Association gathered this time to discuss the politics and military affairs of North China and commonly studied them. All of them believed that the responsibility of the Association was to supervise and guide the administration of the provinces and cities under its jurisdiction. Since the September 18th Incident, it has actively faced the national crisis together, resulting in delays in internal affairs. The Congress believes that long-term resistance to insult should be based on improving internal affairs. All Pinghui and the authorities of various provinces and cities should personally inspect or send personnel to investigate the affairs that should be developed and reformed in the north and implement them within the prescribed period to relieve the people's difficulties and seek construction. For the local officials under their jurisdiction, they must be assessed and strictly screened at any time. As for the military personnel in charge, they are duty-bound to reorganize military affairs during this national crisis. All matters concerning the restoration of lost territories and the consolidation of national defense are the special responsibility of the soldiers of the whole country, and the soldiers in North China are particularly responsible. They should follow the orders of the Central Government, work together, and defend together with one heart, unite sincerely, rely on each other in life and death, and dedicate themselves to the country without hesitation. The members of the Congress consulted sincerely and decided to implement the above two guidelines in a practical manner. At the same time, we also hope that people from all walks of life will assist as much as possible and cooperate with one heart to relieve the national crisis. This is the declaration. (Special telegram on the 31st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A member attending the political conference on the 31st said that the generals in North China who came to Beiping were extremely indignant at the external pressure. They all made up their minds to face the national crisis together. After this consultation on the Rehe matter, they have full confidence. (31st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Han Fuqu said in a speech at the political conference that at this time of national crisis, since everyone has united to resist Japan and defend against insults, it cannot be a mere formality, and must be practical in defending against insults together. (Special telegram on the 31st)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Han Fuqu is scheduled to return to Jinan from Ping tonight or tomorrow morning. (Special telegram on the 31st)</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Bombarded the Border of Rehe</h3>
<p>The Japanese side claimed that they will go deep into Rehe</p>
<p>The situation in Yuguan is also very tense</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tang Yulin telegraphed Ping, saying that although Rehe is tense, it is expected to be safe. (Special telegram on the 31st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to news from the Japanese in Jinzhou, Japanese planes bombed two villages on the border of Rehe and Liaoning yesterday because Chinese volunteers were gathered there. The Japanese army did this because the Chinese authorities failed to release Ishimoto. It is also heard that a large number of volunteers are gathered near Beipiao, so the Japanese planes' bombing may go deep into the territory of Rehe. The Japanese authorities are now blaming the detention of Ishimoto on the volunteers, not on Tang Yulin's regular army. It is also heard that the situation in Yuguan is also very tense. The Japanese army fought with 2,000 volunteers north of the area. (Reuters telegram on the 31st)</p>

<h3>Japanese Propaganda</h3>
<p>The Story of Ma Zhanshan's Death</p>
<p>The Headquarters of the Kwantung Army announced the news</p>
<p>The Tokyo General Staff Headquarters has doubts</p>
<p>The Heihe representative said that Ma is still in Suileng</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese spread unfavorable news about Ma Zhanshan. According to the representative of Heihe stationed in Ping, Ma sent a telegram in the past two days, saying that he was still directing the battle in Suileng Mountain, which shows that there is no such thing. (Special telegram on the 31st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a telegram received in Tokyo from Harbin, General Ma Zhanshan was in a fierce battle with the Tanaka troops in the mountains east of Hailun. General Ma was commanding the battle at the vanguard, and was shot dozens of times and died in the mountains not long after. According to the report of the Tanaka troops, Ma was shot dozens of times and wore the uniform of a lieutenant general, fighting to the death. His bravery is admirable. Although he is an enemy on the battlefield, he is also highly praised as a military general with the characteristics of the Republic of China in recent years. Newspapers in Tokyo also published a brief biography and expressed condolences. However, the Japanese have spread the news of Ma Zhanshan's death seven or eight times. It is also said that Ma usually selected seven or eight people with similar appearances to pretend to be General Ma in order to avoid attracting attention and confuse the Japanese army. This news of death is either a rumor fabricated by the Japanese or a fake Ma Zhanshan. According to this news, our newspaper is doubtful and inquiring about the rear office of the Volunteer Army stationed in Shanghai. According to reports, they have not received any such news. (Hualian News Agency telegram on the 31st)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) The Army Headquarters here received a telegram this morning about Ma Zhanshan's death in battle. However, Ma Zhanshan usually uses three people with similar appearances to pretend to be Ma Zhanshan. Whether the one who died in battle this time is the real Ma is still in doubt among the Japanese army. The Army Headquarters is awaiting a detailed report. (Japanese News Agency telegram on the 31st)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) According to the announcement of the Kwantung Army Headquarters, the Japanese army and Ma Zhanshan's army engaged in fierce fighting from the 27th to the 29th. Ma died in Anxing Town, north of Hailun He (twelve li east of Hailun). (Japanese News Agency telegram on the 31st)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) This morning, the Kwantung Army Headquarters announced that Ma Zhanshan, who had resisted the Japanese army until the end, was finally killed in battle by the Japanese army. It turned out that Ma Zhanshan was cut off from his retreat by the Japanese cavalry that had been detoured to the rear and was subjected to a fierce attack. More than 200 people were killed. When examining the bodies of the dead, Ma Zhanshan's body was found, wearing a lieutenant general's uniform. (Electric News Agency telegram on the 31st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After receiving the news of Ma Zhanshan's death, I immediately asked the General Staff Headquarters for their thoughts. According to Lieutenant Colonel Shibayama's talk, the Army Department has not yet received an official report. However, the fact that he was wearing the uniform of an army lieutenant general when he died in battle is doubtful. From a common sense point of view, he would definitely change his clothes and escape when fleeing to avoid attention. This may be a kind of method of his. (Electric News Agency telegram on the 31st)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) According to the report to the Kwantung Army Headquarters, Ma Zhanshan's body was mixed among the dead. When the Japanese army found it, it was covered with machine gun bullets. The army lieutenant general's uniform was stained with blood, which was truly heroic. (Electric News Agency telegram on the 31st)</p>
<p>(Harbin) According to Japanese sources, the Tanaka's troops, together with the (Manchukuo) army, defeated 800 of Ma Zhanshan's troops near Liujiadian (transliteration), 40 miles north of Hailun. The Japanese claimed that this group was the elite of Ma's troops, with 250 killed, 150 wounded, and 150 horses lost. The Japanese continued to say that Ma's army continued to retreat. Tanaka's troops seized 100 vehicles. It is said that Ma Zhanshan was quite pessimistic due to this defeat and has handed over military power to a certain Zhang. The western section of the Middle East Railway has now been opened to traffic, but trains are often delayed by 14 to 20 hours. The water has not yet receded, and the rain has not stopped. (Reuters telegram on the 31st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) All sectors of the Japanese people are spreading the news of Ma Zhanshan's death, but the public does not believe it, because there is still communication with the Northeast Volunteer Army here today, and no such bad news has been received. Chinese officials said that this is Japanese propaganda, because the Japanese also made this rumor recently, and it was not long before they knew that Ma was still alive. (Reuters telegram on the 31st) (Harbin) According to Japanese sources today, Japanese soldiers attacked 500 Chinese volunteers 35 miles northwest of Hailun, killing 75 enemy soldiers and wounding 30. The Japanese soldiers suffered few casualties, and captured two enemy officers and a lot of bullets. (Reuters telegram on the 31st)</p>

<h3>Legislative Yuan Discusses</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance's Tax Increase Methods</p>
<p>Additional surcharges on customs duties are approved to be continued at 10%</p>
<p>The proposal to increase tax rates on luxury goods was submitted for review</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance believes that the national finances have been affected by the current situation and various factors and are on the verge of bankruptcy. If this continues, the fate of the country may be impossible to maintain. It has drafted measures to increase tax revenue as part of the plan to increase revenue. The principle was discussed and passed at the last plenary session of the Central Political Committee and submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review and handling. The Legislative Yuan continued to discuss this issue in secret after the plenary session on the 30th. It is heard that as a result, the 10% additional surcharge for disaster relief collected by the customs, which was originally scheduled to be reduced by 5% on August 1 this year, has been decided to be collected at 10% for the sake of disaster relief. Among them, 5% will continue to belong to disaster relief and will be suspended when the American wheat loan is repaid. The remaining 5% will be used to relieve the difficulties in finance, but the collection period shall not exceed one year. 2. The Ministry of Finance believes that some imported purely luxury goods in the past customs taxes were not increased according to the detailed items when the tax rules were revised the year before last. Now it plans to increase the types of luxury goods separately according to the standard of progressive customs tax rates. After discussion, it was decided that the Finance Committee, the Economic Committee, and the members of the Legal Committee, Luo Ding, and the members of the Military Committee, Zhu Hezhong, will jointly review the case in detail. The current Chairman of the Finance Committee, Chen Changheng, and the acting Chairman of the Economic Council, Feng Zhaoyi, will hold a joint meeting on the 2nd to review the tax rate increase plan for luxury goods.

<p>Postal workers in Liaoning Province enthusiastically entered the customs</p>

It is estimated that more than 300 people passed through Yuguan, and more than 200 people took the Tanggu route and transferred to Pingjin to serve. Another group took the Dalian route and transferred to Qinghu, but three people were detained. The pseudo-post office is recruiting postal assistants and has now hired more than 500 people.

He was ordered by the former Minister of Railways, Lian Shenghai, to never be employed. Now Gu has reinstated him and successively appointed him as the director of the Vehicle Department of the Daoqing Xiang E Railways Administration.

<h3>Pan Yunchao Talks About His Mission to Beijing</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Pan Yunchao took the night train to Shanghai on the 30th. According to him, since the volunteer army and the previously reduced military personnel in the Northeast formed the Hangri Army and resisted the Japanese army, they have become increasingly active, often inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. Now that the green gauze tent has risen, the enemy is finding it particularly difficult to operate. Almost all areas outside the railway lines are occupied by the Anti-Japanese Army. Although the Japanese army is trying to eliminate the Anti-Japanese Army, it is actually impossible. However, the Anti-Japanese Army is inevitably short of bullets. Since Zhu Jiqing, a member of the committee, came to Beijing to negotiate, the Central Government has agreed to provide assistance. In the future, the strength of the anti-Japanese forces can be greatly assisted. The Rehe incident was entirely a Japanese threat. Since Tang Yulin prepared to resist with strength, his ambitions have not been achieved. Our current deployment is becoming increasingly tight, and we will never follow the same path as Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang. I came here to report the recent situation in Dong Province to the Central Government and, on the other hand, to work with Committee Member Zhu to handle the affairs of assisting the Volunteer Army. An office will be set up in Beijing or Jinan to facilitate contact. (Special telegram on the 31st)</p>

<p>German Parliamentary Re-election</p>
<p>Voting Held Yesterday</p>
<p>Party Flags Fluttering in the Wind</p>
<p>Berlin Streets Unusually Quiet</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 31st Dispatch: Today, Germany re-elected members of parliament. Voting began at 8:00 AM. The weather in Berlin was initially sunny, but there were signs of thunderstorms approaching noon. The most noticeable phenomenon here this morning was the deathly quiet in the streets. Most voters cast their ballots early in the morning, but all had a solemn attitude. There was absolutely no quarreling or commotion in the city. Party flags of various parties fluttered in front of thousands of homes. The National Socialist Party's stormtroopers, dressed in uniform, were stationed throughout the streets, but were all peaceful and disciplined. However, last night, clashes occurred between the National Socialist Party and its opponents in almost all parts of the country, resulting in 10 deaths and 83 injuries. Furthermore, the leader of a Catholic youth group, Xi Ganke, was promoting the Christian Center Party by plane. Shortly after taking off, the plane crashed and was destroyed. The pilot suffered only minor injuries, while Xi was killed instantly. However, as the elections began this morning in various provinces, reports indicate that everything was peaceful. As in Berlin, newspapers of various parties heavily reprinted their leaders' slogans to call for support, such as the Social Democratic Party's and Democratic Party's slogan (Oppose dictatorship, support freedom), the Christian Center Party's slogan (Uphold free nation), the National Rights Party's slogan (National reconstruction), the National Socialist Party's slogan (Give Hitler full power), and the Communist Party's slogan (Down with Fascism). This election is divided into 35 major districts, with a total of 44 million voters. It is expected that at least 36 million will vote, with one parliamentarian produced for every 60,000 votes, for a total of at least 600 seats.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 31st Dispatch: Today, the sun is shining brightly, and voters across the country are extremely excited. Since early morning, voters have been streaming back and forth to the polling stations. By 2:00 PM, it was estimated that 60% of the voters in Berlin had already voted.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 30th Dispatch: Only a few hours remain until the most important election in German history. Everyone is asking, "Hitler or Chancellor von Papen?" Hitler has had three opportunities in recent months to seize power and create a fascist state, but he has failed three times. It is unknown whether he will be able to seize it this time. There are a total of 44 million voters in the country. It is expected that at least 35 million people will vote tomorrow. A total of 27 parties are participating, but most are anomalous and unlikely to win a single vote. The ones to watch are the Social Democratic Party, the National Socialist Party, the Center Party, the National Rights Party, and the Nationalist Party. The number of seats in the new parliament will depend on the number of votes cast. If 35 million people vote, there will be approximately 584 seats, and 293 seats are needed to gain an absolute majority. According to the latest predictions, the National Socialist Party may win 220 seats, the National Rights Party 45 seats, the Social Democratic Party 140 seats, the Center Party 72 seats, and the Communist Party 72 seats, with the remaining parties holding 35 seats. If this happens, there will be an absolute deadlock, and the Center Party will hold a pivotal position. In this case, the Papen government's ability to continue to hold power may be assured.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 30th Dispatch: The current German election adopts a list-based proportional representation system. Every 60,000 valid votes will elect one parliamentarian. Based on this estimate, the sixth German Lower House will likely have at least 600 parliamentarians. As the number of electors is increasing daily, the number of participants in the election is also gradually increasing.</p>
<p>Reuters, Munich, 30th Dispatch: The Bavarian election campaign has reached fever pitch. The National Socialist Party is now driving old and young, men and women, to provide support at the last minute. Even children in the streets are cheering for Hitler, and young girls are wearing ribbons to persuade passersby to vote for Hitler. Although there are no obvious conflicts at the moment, the deep hatred between the opposing parties is unprecedented. Therefore, Germans with foresight are concerned about the overall situation after the election.</p>

<p>Continued Foreign Important Telegrams 2</p>
<p>National Wealth Must First Come from Rural Wealth</p>
<p>Strive for Equality in Military Preparedness</p>
<p>Papen's Final Campaign Speech</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 30th Dispatch: The German parliamentary election is imminent. Chancellor von Papen gave a radio broadcast speech today, urging the people of the country to fulfill their duties as citizens and participate in the election tomorrow to ensure that the country has a truly representative parliament to cooperate with the current non-partisan cabinet. Papen stated that the current cabinet transcends party disputes and has taken on significant responsibilities during a difficult time, including reorganizing finances, rebuilding public order internally, and canceling reparations and establishing a foundation for international equality externally. Papen also announced the outline of his policies, which include maintaining and increasing agricultural products, as the saying goes, "National wealth must first come from rural wealth," which is an immutable principle. However, the livelihood of farmers still depends on the consuming masses, so the second step is to revitalize industry and commerce. The various constraints on industry and commerce should be removed first, and then the government must vigorously reduce government spending and improve financial taxation. The unemployed should be provided with jobs. All of these are part of the current government's arduous work. In addition to Papen, leaders of various factions have generally made speeches as a final effort in the election. This German parliamentary election is not only the most important event for the German people but also attracts worldwide attention.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 30th Dispatch: German Chancellor von Papen issued his final election speech tonight, implying that if Geneva does not recognize the right to equal military preparedness, the German government will withdraw from the League of Nations. Papen said that the German government will not change its stance adopted in Geneva under any circumstances. If this stance is not satisfied, it will adopt the necessary plans. He also said that he considers the Weimar Constitution in need of amendment. If this election results in a deadlock, the current cabinet should continue to perform its duties.</p>

<h3>US Democratic Party Presidential Candidate</h3>
<p>Roosevelt's Political Views</p>

<p>Proposes Amending the Prohibition Law in the New Congress</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 30th Dispatch: Democratic presidential candidate Roosevelt began his election campaign speech today, saying that the United Kingdom, France, and Germany have finally agreed on the issue of reparations. The current crisis is that they may unite to deal with the United States. This crisis is caused more by those who owe debts to the United States than by the United States erecting high trade barriers. The Democratic Party's policy is to advocate for the repayment of debts, but also to reduce tariffs and restore trade. With lower tariffs and restored trade, debts can be repaid. The United States can take the lead in promoting the leveling of financial relations in the General Assembly to restore the purchasing power of silver. Roosevelt also said that if the current Congress does not want to amend the Prohibition Law, he will ask the new Congress to amend it.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>North China</h3>
<p>Generals Arrive in Peiping for Meeting</p>
<p>Serious Discussion on Maintaining North China</p>
<p>Plan to Issue Declaration Pledging to Defend National Territory</p>
<p>Peiping Correspondence: The Peiping Political Affairs Committee, concerned about the tense situation, held an extraordinary meeting on the 26th of this month to discuss various matters of great importance to diplomacy, military affairs, and finance. It was also decided that Zhang Xueliang, Director of the Peiping Pacification Headquarters, should telegraph provincial generals to hold a special military and political research conference to jointly devise methods to resist aggression. Zhang convened a meeting at Shuncheng Wangfu at 8:00 PM on the 28th. Those present were Han Fuju of Shandong, Xu Yongchang of Shanxi, Fu Zuoyi of Suiyuan, Liu Yifei of Chahar, and Meng Zhaotian of Jehol. In addition, those attending from the northeastern provinces were Rong Zhen, Zhang Zuoxiang, and Wan Fulin. Central government representatives Zhang Qun and Jiang Bocheng, and the generals of the Hebei garrison, Shang Zhen, Yu Xuezhong, Men Zhizhong, and Song Zheyuan, also participated. The meeting was chaired by Zhang Xueliang. During the meeting, the territorial officials all expressed their opinions on military and political plans, and concrete research was proposed on the overall military and political issues. All resolutions were submitted to the twenty-second formal meeting, held at 10:00 AM this morning (the 29th) for discussion. The formal meeting was very important. All committee members in Peiping were notified and attended. There will be a careful discussion and decision on the steps to be taken regarding the entire plan to maintain North China. It is also planned to issue a declaration to inform the national people and pledge to defend the national territory. In addition, Fang Benren, acting on the orders of Chiang Kai-shek, came to Peiping to negotiate with Zhang Xueliang on important military and political events in North China. He took the Beijing-Hankou express train north yesterday morning and is expected to arrive in Peiping at 7:00 AM tomorrow morning. It is said that after Fang arrives in Peiping, Zhang Qun, who had previously come to Peiping on Chiang's orders, will hand over the negotiation mission to Fang, and Zhang himself will go to Hebian Village to meet with Yan Xishan to discuss matters on behalf of Chiang and Zhang. According to Zhang, he was ordered to come to Peiping to consult with Director Zhang, and now that the matter is over, he plans to go to Taiyuan at the beginning of next month and then to Hebian Village to meet with Yan (Xishan). He has not met Yan for a long time, and they both want to meet, but there is no specific mission. He will stay in Shanxi for about three days before deciding whether to return to Nanjing or go to Hankou. Regarding the summoning of the generals of North China to Peiping by Director Zhang, it is because the generals are all members of the Peiping Political Affairs Committee. It is usually difficult to convene a full meeting of the Peiping Political Affairs Committee, so Director Zhang telegraphed the generals to come to Peiping to hold an extraordinary meeting of the Peiping Political Affairs Committee to conduct a concrete discussion on military, political, and diplomatic affairs in North China.

<h3>Continued News of Bandit Suppression in Hubei Province</h3>
<p>Chiang Issues Order Encouraging Red Bandit Officials of All Ranks to Surrender</p>
<p>Party and Government Meeting Divides into Ten Districts for Inspection and Handling of Post-War Affairs</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The military operations to suppress bandits in Hubei Province, since Chiang Kai-shek's arrival in Hankou, have been developing daily. Besides Kuang's bandits being defeated in eastern Hubei, and Kong's bandits being defeated in southern Hubei, not daring to attempt a counter-offensive, He's bandits in central Hubei have suffered particularly heavy blows. According to intelligence from the left-wing army on the 30th, this army has been conducting suppression operations in multiple directions since the 15th. In the past ten days, they have engaged in dozens of battles, large and small, with the bandits. The most fierce battles were the following: (1) The Battle of Yangjiachang: Our Second Column encountered the pseudo-Ninth Division. Our army launched a flanking attack, defeating the bandit's pseudo-26th Regiment, killing many bandits, capturing hundreds of prisoners, and seizing many automatic rifles, machine guns, mortars, rifles, horses, supplies, and propaganda items, as well as the official seal of the pseudo-Ninth Division. (2) The Battles of Heilu Crossing and Zhangjie Port: Our Fourth Column attacked the bandits by surprise at night. Although the bandits resisted desperately, they ultimately became demoralized and fled without orders. Many drowned along the river. Dozens of guns were seized, and even more bandits were captured. (3) The Battle of Huibutou: Our Third Column engaged in a fierce battle with the pseudo-Seventh Division's 19th Regiment, killing two battalion commanders, seizing over 60 guns, and capturing over 100 bandits. Countless bandits were killed or drowned. (4) The Battle of Qianjiang: Our Huang and Liu brigades crossed the river from Zhangjie Port and attacked Qianjiang late at night on the 23rd. When crossing the river, the bandits resisted from across the river on the south bank. We provided cover with mortars and machine guns, and our officers and soldiers bravely forced their way across the river, finally crossing the river at Chou hour on the 24th, and attacking in force. At noon that day, Qianjiang County was recaptured. In this battle, many bandits were killed, and dozens were captured alive, seizing dozens of guns. (5) The Battle of Maliang: The remnants of the pseudo-Seventh and Eighth Divisions were chased by our various columns and had nowhere to escape. On the 27th, they took the opportunity to cross to Maliang, but were pursued by our First Column. The bandits fled along the river embankment, and we used mortars and machine guns to fire fiercely, sinking several bandit ships. Furthermore, according to telegrams from Xu Yuanquan, Dong Zhichu, Wan Yaohuang, and Zhu Hengbing, the pseudo-Eighth and Ninth Divisions suffered the greatest losses, while the Seventh Division was relatively intact, led by He, crossing the river only to be blocked by the 21st Sichuan Army. Those who did not cross were pursued and suppressed by Wan Yaohuang's division. The remaining bandit troops were no more than fish in a cauldron. However, the officers and soldiers are marching and fighting in the scorching sun, and many have died from the heat, which is truly tragic. Commander-in-Chief Chiang awarded the troops on this route separately to show his concern. Furthermore, on the 30th, he issued a general order to all units, stating that this bandit suppression is related to the survival of the nation. The officers and soldiers who contributed to the operation, in addition to being specially commended by the headquarters at any time, those who are wounded and do not retreat, or who are captured and do not yield, will be reported to the National Government by the headquarters for special rewards, to encourage meritorious service. All generals should also use this to inspire their officers and soldiers, so that they can demonstrate the spirit of revolutionary soldiers and win glory for the country and the nation. At the same time, he also issued an order to allow bandit leaders to reform themselves and surrender: (1) Red bandit pseudo-division commanders who can lead their troops to surrender will be promoted, their ranks will be retained, they will be incorporated into the formal National Army, and the entire division of officers and soldiers will be rewarded with 100,000 yuan. (2) Red bandit pseudo-brigade commanders who can lead their troops to surrender will be promoted one rank, their ranks will be retained, they will be incorporated into the formal National Army, and the entire brigade of officers and soldiers will be rewarded with 30,000 yuan. (3) Red bandit pseudo-regiment commanders who can lead their troops to surrender or act as internal agents will be promoted one rank, their ranks will be retained, they will be incorporated into the formal National Army, and the entire regiment of officers and soldiers will be rewarded with 10,000 yuan. (4) Red bandit pseudo-battalion commanders who can lead their troops to surrender or act as internal agents will be promoted one rank, their ranks will be retained, they will be incorporated into the formal National Army, and the entire battalion of officers and soldiers will be rewarded with 5,000 yuan. (5) Red bandit pseudo-company commanders who can lead their troops to surrender or act as internal agents will be promoted one rank, their ranks will be retained, they will be incorporated into the formal National Army, and the entire company of officers and soldiers will be rewarded with 1,500 yuan. (6) Red bandit pseudo-division, brigade, regiment, battalion, and company commanders who surrender individually will be allowed to retain their original ranks and await employment, without being held accountable for the past. The above orders have been printed in tens of thousands of copies and sent by plane to be distributed in the bandit areas. It is noted that Chiang, upon first arriving in Hankou, issued an order to treat those who were coerced into joining the bandits leniently. Many red bandit soldiers and coerced civilians responded to the order and defected, which was very effective. Now, taking advantage of the red bandits' recent defeat and panicked flight, he is giving the bandit officials an opportunity to reform themselves. It is expected that there will be many more who will obey the order and surrender. As for the post-war handling of the bandit areas, in addition to the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, Zhu Huaibing, being stationed outside for a long time to inspect and specially handle local pacification, the Party and Government Committee of the Headquarters and the Hubei Party and Government Meeting are fully responsible for it. Although the Party and Government Meeting has not yet been formally established, the work is extremely intense. On the 30th, the meeting held a discussion and approved the Hubei Party and Government Inspection Outline, which is divided into three items: party affairs, politics, and military affairs. The listed items are extremely detailed. The entire province is divided into ten districts, which will be inspected in two phases. The first phase will begin in August, first inspecting the seven districts with varying degrees of banditry in eastern Hubei, southern Hubei, northern Hubei, and central Hubei. The second phase will be three districts, such as counties with lighter banditry in western Hubei. The planned inspection period is one month. Each district will be a group, jointly organized by one person from the Provincial Committee, one person from the Provincial and Municipal Party Committee, and several people dispatched by the Headquarters. They will inspect the situation in each district on the one hand, and handle local post-war affairs on the other. (July 30th)</p>
<h3>Pinghan Railway</h3>
<p>Robbery on the Zhangde Train</p>
<p>The Pinghan Railway Bureau Cables the Bandit Suppression Headquarters</p>
<p>Orders the Railway Protection Team to Solve the Case Within Five Days</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The troubled Pinghan Railway was sabotaged by bandits three times last month, causing huge losses. Travelers already regard it as a dangerous route. Not long ago, there was another incident of Liu Guitang's deserters robbing a train near Zhangde, stealing a bag of money from Zhangde Station, seizing six rifles from the escort soldiers, injuring one railway employee, and one going missing. One bandit was also accidentally killed by his accomplices. The losses of the passengers have not yet been accurately reported. After receiving the report, the Pinghan Railway Bureau specifically telegraphed the bandit suppression headquarters of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui provinces, the Beiping Pacification Office, and the Ministry of Railways on the 30th, reporting the details of the robbery. The telegram said: (To Commander-in-Chief Chiang in Hankou, Director Zhang of the Beiping Pacification Office, Minister Gu and Vice Minister Zeng Jun of the Nanjing Ministry of Railways: According to a telegram from the Chief Section Chief of the Zhengzhou Vehicle Affairs Department, at 2:00 PM on the 28th, a special express train was heading south from Zhangde. Dozens of passengers boarded the train with tickets. Unexpectedly, there were more than ten bandits hiding pistols. After the train passed Baoliansi, they opened fire in the third-class carriage, searching and robbing passengers in the first and second classes in turn. They also robbed a bag of money from Zhangde Station, six rifles from the escort soldiers, and shot and wounded a brakeman. They forced the train to stop outside Beiyangqi in Qixian and escaped. The area north of the Yellow River has always been said to be quiet. This incident was unexpected, and the duty was negligent. We will order the railway police to closely pursue and arrest the bandits, and pay close attention to the passengers at each station. We hereby report. We respectfully request that you inform the garrison troops along the line to provide proper protection for the Pinghan passenger trains in the future to ensure safety. I am deeply grateful. I, He Jingwu, bow.) Another telegram was sent to the Zhangde Railway Protection Team and the Zhengzhou Police Section, ordering them to solve the case within a specified period. The telegram said: (To Liu, Captain of the First Brigade of the Zhangde Railway Protection Team, and Niu, Chief Section Chief of the Second Section of the Zhengzhou Police Department: The No. [blank] special express train robbery case must be solved within five days. Failure to do so will be severely punished.) Another telegram was sent to the police personnel at each station along the route, instructing them to pay close attention to passengers boarding the train in the future, and to search and inspect anyone who appears suspicious. The escort officers and soldiers should also pay attention at all times to ensure the safety of travelers and show caution. (July 30th)</p>
<h3>The Funds for Han's Troops Are Secured</h3>
<p>To Be Borne by the National Tax Authorities in Shandong</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Central Government originally stipulated that the funds for the Third Route Army of Han Fuju's troops should be allocated monthly from the Shandong salt tax, stamp duty, tobacco and alcohol consolidated tax, Luda Zhongxing mining tax, and various national tax items such as furnaces, smoke, saltpeter, and sulfur, totaling 600,000 yuan per month. If it was insufficient, the Ministry of Finance would make up the difference. If there was a surplus, it would be submitted to the Central Government. Last month (June), because it was a slow month, there was a shortfall of more than 200,000 or 300,000 yuan. The Ministry of Finance temporarily remitted 100,000 yuan to Jinan to make up the difference. Although this month is still a slow month, the Ministry of Finance believes that the Central Government's finances are extremely difficult and it is unable to provide further assistance to Shandong. However, the funds for Han's troops must be issued, so the quota of national tax authorities were increased across the board. All agencies were strictly ordered to collect a total of 600,000 yuan, no matter what, to reduce the burden on the Central Government. After receiving the order, the agencies actively urged the payment of old arrears and reorganized current income. It is reported that, except for the salt tax, the rest can all collect the quota. The Third Route Army funds will not require Central Government subsidies, and there will be no need to worry this month.</p>
<h3>Sudden Tension in the Lower Reaches of the Yellow River</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: In recent days, the water level of the Yellow River has continued to rise. Today, the Luokou water gauge north of the city suddenly rose another 2.3 inches, reaching a water level of 29.64 meters, equivalent to 8 zhang, 8 chi, 9 cun, and 2 fen in municipal units. This is only slightly over 1 meter less than the highest water level of 30.97 meters last year. The floodwater from the upper and middle reaches is flowing down like water pouring from a high roof, and the numerous dangerous works along the lower reaches are causing increasing tension at every point. On the north bank, at Guiren East, Huimin County, the main current is sweeping the edge, collapsing the river beach for over 150 zhang in length and over 1 zhang in width, destroying 625 willow saplings. The riverbank is only 8 or 9 chi from the embankment at the closest point. On the south bank, at Wangwangzhuang, Putai County, the stone protection of the 20th section of the diversion dam has collapsed for 2.5 zhang.</p>
<p>On the north bank, at Damajia and Sunjia, Lijin County, the current is fierce, and the soil is flattened. At Zhangjiatan, the current is close to the embankment, and the bank has been eroded for over 10 zhang. The wind and waves are very strong. Zhang Lianjia, the Director of the River Affairs Bureau, inspected Zhukou, where the border between Hebei and Shandong is located in the upper reaches, yesterday. Seeing that the situation in the upper reaches was stable, but the lower reaches suddenly became tense, he rushed back from Zhukou yesterday, spent the night in Shilibao, and set off from Shilibao this morning. He is expected to reach Luokou tonight, and will then go down to the lower reaches to supervise the emergency repairs. The following is a record of the emergency telegrams from the lower reaches: (1) Telegram from Qinghe: The section chief inspected each work point and found that the current at Wangzaojia is shifting downwards and impacting the top. The current at the Zhaojia dam, the 14th major dam at the entrance of the section, is flowing to the south bank. That area has become a stable water area, but at the Guiren East main current, the riverbank has collapsed for over 150 zhang in length and over 1 zhang in width, destroying 625 willow saplings. The riverbank is over 10 zhang from the embankment, and only 8 or 9 chi from the old dam at the closest point. The other works are still stable. In addition to ordering each dam to strengthen defenses, I hereby report. Please note. Li Fuchang respectfully reports. (2) Telegram from Damajia: The water level at Sunma has been rising continuously in recent days, and the beach mouth on the opposite south bank is collapsing daily. On the north bank, the current is shifting downwards. The tail of the Sunjia work and the upper part of the Majia work are experiencing fierce currents. Yesterday, the lower corner of the 14th dam at Sunjia and the upper corner of the 4th dam at Majia were flattened by 3 chi. We ordered the workers to add pressure overnight to stabilize them. At Zhangjiatan, the old danger point, the new beach is underwater, and the current is close to the embankment, with a water depth of 5 or 6 chi, and up to 8 or 9 chi in some places. This is because a current diverted from Majia is flowing there, and the wind has also shifted to the south. The corner of the dam has been eroded for 5 zhang, and another 6 or 7 zhang has been eroded. We transported half a stack of straw from Majia and ordered the team to tie it up and throw it to resist the wind and waves. The other works are still stable. Considering that the period of high water will be long, the 30-plus stacks of materials stored at Sunma are not enough. Please add more for emergency needs. We respectfully request. Zheng Rongdi and Ji Baoren respectfully report. (3) Telegram from Wangwangzhuang: The 1st dam of the 18th diversion dam at Wangwangzhuang has been strengthened yesterday and is stable. The stone protection along the 20th section collapsed for 2.5 zhang yesterday afternoon. We immediately supervised and ordered the workers to throw stones with all their strength, and it is now above the water. The upper corners of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd dams at Yanjia have been flattened by 1 chi and have been reinforced with one pile of materials, and are all stable. Furthermore, the situation at Bianzhuang has not changed. Please relieve our worries. Yang Chenglin and Zhou Yumei jointly report.</p>
<h3>Tianjin</h3>
<p>The Water Level of Each River Rises Sharply</p>
<p>The Water Level of the South Canal Is the Most Dangerous</p>
<p>The River Affairs Bureau Allocates Funds for Protection</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Recently, the weather has been cloudy and rainy, and the water level of the rivers has risen sharply. In the low-lying areas in the four suburbs of the city, water has accumulated into pools, several feet deep. The turbulent waves are scouring both sides of the riverbank, and many unstable signs are appearing. There are frequent reports of the collapse of civil dikes due to the rising water.

The River Affairs Bureau is doing its best to prevent disasters and is trying to provide emergency protection. The Construction Department of the Provincial Government has allocated 4,000 yuan for emergency protection, which will be distributed by the bureau to each section to purchase more emergency repair equipment, and closely patrol the area. It also ordered that if the river water becomes too high and gradually overflows the top of the dike, all the gates and dams of the entire river should be raised and the gate doors opened, and the dikes should be excavated to provide drainage and avoid major disasters. According to measurements, the current water level of the river has risen as follows: Section 1, Lianzhen, has risen 1.42 meters, the water depth in the center is 6.15 meters, and the height of the dike above the water surface is 0.3 meters.

<h3>Japanese Will Establish</h3>
<p>Post Office in Qingdao</p>
<p>The Municipal Government Protests to the Japanese Consulate Without Effect</p>
<p>Intending to Take the Opportunity to Seize Our Country's Postal Rights</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The Qingdao Post Office, due to an order from the General Post Office, stopped collecting and sending all remittances and all kinds of mail and packages to and from the three northeastern provinces from the 24th of this month. The Japanese Consul-General in Qingdao, Kawagoe Shigeru, sent Deputy Consul Isobe to negotiate with the postal authorities at that time, and at the same time formulated temporary measures for the mail of Japanese residents to and from the three northeastern provinces, and temporarily set up a postal office in the residential community to handle the mail to and from the three northeastern provinces. The Japanese residents also jointly petitioned the Japanese consulate, requesting the establishment of a Japanese post office in Qingdao, intending to take the opportunity to seize our country's postal rights. The postal office established by the Japanese has started working yesterday. The municipal government believes that this move by the Japanese is a clear infringement of our country's postal rights, and specially sent Councilor Zhou Jiayan to the Japanese consulate to protest severely, ordering them to cancel it. At that time, the Japanese consul's attitude was extremely tough, and he replied that the suspension of postal services to the Northeast by the Chinese post office caused extreme inconvenience to the Japanese residents in this city. As a temporary relief measure, this expedient was adopted. If the Chinese post office can resume receiving and sending mail to and from the Northeast, the postal office established by the Japanese residents can be cancelled immediately. Otherwise, the Japanese government will set up international post offices in international commercial centers such as Shanghai and Qingdao. If anyone tries to obstruct it, our side will respond with appropriate means. Councilor Zhou saw that the negotiation was fruitless and immediately returned to the municipal government to report. It is heard that the municipal government believes that this matter is related to our country's sovereignty. In addition to reporting the facts to the central government, it will make another protest to the Japanese consul, ordering them to cancel it to maintain postal rights.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Business</h3>

<p>Inspecting the Industrial and Commercial Situation Inside and Outside the City</p>

<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Qingdao Mayor Shen Honglie, in order to develop the city's industry and commerce, previously entrusted Wang Zhengting and Gao Enhong to invite Shanghai industrialists and entrepreneurs to visit Qingdao and invite them to invest in and run industries to assist in the development of industry and commerce. The industrialists agreed and organized a business inspection group. The group arrived in Qingdao at 7:00 AM on the 28th of this month. The municipal government had made preparations for reception and welcome in advance, and specially appointed Councilor Tong Jiayan, Yang Jinsheng, Social Bureau Director Chu Zhen, Finance Bureau Director Guo Binghe, Municipal Government First Section Chief Jin Shaolian, Third Section Chief Xie Zuyuan, and Social Bureau Third Section Chief Dong Zhidao as reception specialists, and prepared the Yingbin Hotel, Qingdao Club, Laoshan Hotel, and Qingdao Hotel for the group members to stay in. Each place was assigned a receptionist to provide constant service. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the banking community also sent reception specialists, including Chamber of Commerce Chairman Song Yuting, Executive Committee members Ding Jingchen, Zhang Yutian, Yu Weiting, Zhou Zhijun, Li Zumo, Bank of Communications Manager Yao Zhongba, Bank of China Manager Wang Yangxian, and Minghua Bank Manager Zhang Gongbo. At around 7:00 AM this morning, Mayor Shen Honglie, accompanied by the reception specialists, went to the Dagang Pier to welcome them. The Daming Wheel they were on had already docked outside the back harbor. The port authority sent the Jin Xing launch to meet them. Mayor Shen personally took the launch to the ship to welcome them. After the group members disembarked, they greeted the welcomers one by one, and then took the cars prepared by the municipal government to stay at the above-mentioned places. Also coming with them were former Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting, former Jiaozhou Governor Gao Enhong, etc. The list of the group members is recorded as follows: Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Zhao Jinqing, Wang Yansong, Wu Kaisheng, Pan Gongzhan, Gao Ding'an (staying at Yingbin Hotel), Bei Zaian, Chen Zheqing, Wu Renzhi, Zhao Shenzhi, Liu Yunfang, Miss Zhang (staying at Laoshan Hotel), Lin Zheqing, Mao Zijian, Huang Ruisheng, Fan Zhenchu (staying at Qingdao Hotel), Li Zushen, Wang Rutang (staying at Qingdao Club), Yan Keqing (staying at Jinkou Road). The leaders of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the banking community, because most of the group members are important figures in the Shanghai business community, held a banquet at the Huiquan Qingdao Cafe at noon today to connect with them. At 7:00 PM, Mayor Shen also held a banquet at the Yingbin Hotel to welcome the group and invited Tang Shengzhi, who came to Qingdao to escape the summer heat, as well as leaders from the military, political, business, and news circles of the city to accompany them. The banquet was lively and enjoyable. This reporter visited Wang Xiaojun at the Yingbin Hotel this afternoon, but Wang was out. I then visited Mr. Zhao Jinqing, who agreed to meet. I asked the reporter, What is the purpose of your group's visit to Qingdao for inspection? Zhao replied, Our group's visit to Qingdao was at the invitation of Mayor Shen through Mr. Wang Zhengting and Shang Enhong, so we took advantage of the summer vacation to come to Qingdao for inspection. We will stay in Qingdao for about a week. During this period, we will inspect the general situation of Qingdao's construction and the industrial and commercial situation inside and outside the city, and examine in detail what industries Qingdao needs and is suitable for, as a reference for the group. As for how to invest in the future and what industries should be run, it will be determined after the inspection. I asked, Will your group go to Weihai for a trip? He replied, Weihai Management Commissioner Xu Zushan is an old friend of former Minister Wang, and originally wanted to invite our group to visit, but the members of our group have jobs, and are limited by time, so the plan to go to Weihai has been abandoned. After the inspection here, some will return to Shanghai by sea, and some will take a car to Hunan, and then transfer to Ji and return to Shanghai. As for former Minister Wang Zhengting, after attending the Jiaoji Railway Board meeting on the 30th of this month, he will go to Beiping for a trip. (July 28th)</p>
<h3>Severe Drought and Cholera Epidemic in Northern Anhui</h3>
<p>More Than 100 People Died in Huaiyuan County in Half a Month</p>
<p>Bengbu Has Been Dry for a Long Time, and Villagers Are Praying for Rain One After Another</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: Since the beginning of summer, there has been little rainfall here. During the hot season, the weather has been exceptionally hot, unprecedented in recent years. In the past few days, the temperature in the room has often been between 93 and 97 degrees Fahrenheit. Sitting in the room and fanning constantly, one still sweats like rain. The sun is scorching on the road, and pedestrians often faint. From the beginning of the month to the present, no rain has fallen in more than 20 days, and the climate feels even drier. A drought has developed in various counties in northern Anhui. Many seedlings, sorghum, and beans in the fields have withered. The farmers are worried and anxious because there has been no rain for a long time. They all say that if it does not rain again, there is no hope for the autumn harvest. Recalling this time last year, it rained heavily all day long, and the river water was high. This summer, however, droughts are common, and there is no rain at all. Compared with the summer of last year, it is the opposite. However, the villagers are ignorant and pray to the gods for rain one after another, doing all kinds of meaningless superstitious actions. However, no rain has been seen to fall. At this time of hot weather and severe drought, the plague is taking advantage of the opportunity to break out. There are frequent reports of people dying from cholera. Coffins are often seen being carried out of the streets for funerals, and families are crying. The cholera epidemic is particularly severe in Huaiyuan County, 25 li west of Bengbu. Within half a month, more than 100 people have died in the city and countryside, and there are even more deaths in the countryside. Before cholera was discovered here, the Anhui North Circulating Medical Team of the Health and Epidemic Prevention Group of the National Government Flood Relief Committee, stationed in Bengbu, began implementing epidemic prevention vaccination work last month. Every day, they cooperate with the Public Security Bureau to forcibly vaccinate door-to-door, with great effect. They also set up temporary epidemic prevention stations in the Red Cross and Red Swastika associations to facilitate citizens to go for vaccination voluntarily, and to provide treatment for patients. Vaccination began on June 27. In the first week, 3,894 people were vaccinated; in the second week, 3,420 people were vaccinated; in the third week, 5,240 people were vaccinated; and in the fourth week, 6,526 people were vaccinated. A total of 18,080 people were vaccinated in four weeks, using a total of 220 bottles of cholera vaccine and 30 bottles of typhoid and cholera mixed vaccine. Therefore, after the active prevention by the Anhui North Circulating Medical Team, the cholera epidemic is not very rampant. According to an investigation by the Public Security Bureau, from the 12th to the 25th of this month, there are 212 people who have cholera and are still alive, and only 31 have died. Mrs. Liu Jiang of Huoqiu in the fifth district contracted true cholera (i.e., cholera) in the afternoon of the 24th and died this morning (26th). All sectors here are now organizing an epidemic prevention committee and planning to set up a temporary epidemic isolation hospital for large-scale prevention. Preparations are currently underway.

<p>Report on the Robbery of a Patrol Boat: Regarding the case of the No. 6 patrol boat of the 13th team of the Changshu Water Police being towed to Suzhou by the Laogongmao steamship and robbed by an armed steamer along the way, Chief Shen of the Third District has now specially dispatched Inspector Jiang Shuzhang to investigate the truth in the countryside. Gan Jiuling, the captured patrol officer, has also escaped and come to Suzhou to report to the district. According to him, the white-hulled steamer was spotted in Likou three days before the incident. The ship's name had been painted over, but the characters "Jia Hu" were vaguely visible. There were eleven people on board, all fully armed and without insignia, holding five rifles, four Mauser pistols, and one hand-held machine gun. One of them, wearing yellow pants and a Western-style shirt, seemed to be the leader. He first led the group ashore to drink tea. The town's original security corps of over ten people found the situation suspicious but dared not investigate due to their fierce looks and sharp weapons. On the afternoon of the 29th, at 3:00 or 4:00 PM, when the Laogongmao steamship was towing the patrol boat, when the vessels were passing the Mo Jia Dian area, four miles from Lijiang, it was intercepted, and sacks and a box of bullets were stolen from the patrol boat.

<p>Collision of Ships Leads to Drowning of a Shipowner: Yesterday (the 30th) at 2:00 PM, a large paper boat from Changzhou, owned by Yao Lin, was sailing from Wuxi Bridge to Changzhou. A certain Jia, the owner of an empty pig boat from Hengshan Bridge, Changzhou, requested that the empty pig boat be towed to Henglin. Yao agreed because the wind was favorable and it would not cost manpower. Towing to the Hua Daqiao port of Loshe town in the Sixteenth District, Yao ship was about to stop. He asked a certain Jia to untie the cable. Unexpectedly, at that time, a Liyang small steamship happened to be passing by, and it crashed into the empty pig boat due to negligence. A certain Jia, standing unsteadily at the bow of the boat, fell into the river. The small steamship did not stop and drove into the city. A certain Jia’s body did not float to the surface after entering the river. Although all parties searched for it, they had no success.

Captain Wang sent Deputy Captain Deng Jue Dong to the Seventh District (Zhang Jingqiao) with the Captain of the First Team, Feng Ziqian. Then they invited Du Changchang, the village head of Rang Village, and Gu Zichang, the village head of Yang Village, to ask about the poor stealing rice.

Fenggang's wife, Ms. Guo, was watching the assembly when Ding Guifu satirized her with vulgar language, causing an argument. Ding then used a kitchen knife to slash Guo's right temple, left forehead, and right shoulder. Seeing that Guo was stabbed, Guo's family rushed to Guifu's south goods store, burning and smashing paper horses, money, sauce jars, and sundries. The Erjia group heard the news and arrested the assailant Guifu. The injured person was sent to the Houcheng Hospital for treatment.

<p>Chamber of Commerce Asks the Department of Finance to Return Loan: The Jiangsu Department of Finance borrowed 100,000 yuan from the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce during the outbreak of the Shanghai War, with an agreement to repay it within two months. Later, due to the province’s financial difficulties, the term was extended for another three months. Now the term has expired, and the households that advanced the funds are in urgent need of this money to turn around due to business failures and financial exhaustion. After receiving the letter from the Chamber of Commerce, it sent a telegram to the Department of Finance requesting an allocation of funds to repay the advance. Yesterday, a reply was received from the department, stating that it had received the telegram and that the department was to return the 100,000 yuan borrowed from the Chamber of Commerce, that the due date for extension had arrived, but that the province was in extreme financial distress. It was only possible to negotiate a further extension of three months, which it was hoped they would allow. The Chamber of Commerce found it difficult to extend the loan again and sent another telegram to the Department of Finance requesting that it be returned. It said it was powerless to comply with the previous request to extend the loan for another three months and appealed to the department to grant a return of the original loan of 100,000 yuan, including interest, to relieve the commercial hardship.</p>

<h3>Davis Cup Returns Again</h3>
<p>France Retains Title</p>
<p>Borotra Defeats Allison Again</p>
<p>France Now Wins Over the USA Three to One</p>
<p>France Has Won the Championship for Six Years in a Row</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 31st: The final two matches of the Davis Cup were held today at the Roland Garros tennis court in Paris. As a result, Borotra defeated Allison by a score of 6-1, 3-6, 6-4, 2-6, 7-5. France, which has held the Davis Cup for five years, will retain it this year, having won it for six consecutive years.</p>
<p>(1) Details of the Doubles Match</p>
<p>American Players Perform Vigorously</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 30th: Today's Davis Cup doubles match was as grand as the first day. Those who are addicted to it waited at the ticket office in the morning, hoping to buy a ticket, but soon the tickets were sold out and some people returned disappointed. Before the afternoon game started, the grandstand was full. There were a total of less than 15,000 people.</p>
<p>Allison is Forbidding At 3:10 PM Borotra entered. The audience welcomed Borotra warmly. In a few moments, Van Ryn and Allison, Cochet and Brugnon entered one after another. At 3:15, the performance began. The American group was more united, while the French group was quite embarrassed. Allison was especially forbidding. Cochet and Brugnon repeatedly tried to concentrate their attacks on Ai, but Van Ryn tried his best to support him, and Cobb's plan failed. The first game was won by the United States. In the second game, Cochet served,</p>

<p>Has Been Won by France for Six Consecutive Years</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>Although speedy, the victory still belonged to the United States. In the third game, Van Ryn served and won without losing a single ball. In the fourth game, Brugnon's serve was very accurate, but the victory in this game still belonged to the United States. At this time, the United States was ahead with a score of four to zero. Then France won back two games, but the United States finally won the first set by six to three.</p>
<p>French Players Escape from Death: The second set started with Cochet serving forcefully to win the first game. But in the second game, Allison's ball was fast and even, creating a tie of one to one. The American group had a very orderly game, and the walls were tight. The French were greatly embarrassed, so although they took the offensive, they were very cautious. The American group used high balls to disturb the enemy's rear, but the French all returned them. At this point, Allison felt the danger and worked hard to cheer himself up. The two sides were tied at five to five, the competition was fierce, and the players on both sides seemed extremely annoyed and made a lot of mistakes. The American group won the eleventh game, and the French situation was in danger. Fortunately, a balance was achieved. The two sides were constantly changing strategies, trying every means to confuse the enemy. Then from six to six, to seven to seven, and to eight to eight, the American side, and Allison tried to win quickly, which was obvious, but the score was up to nine to seven again, and finally to the eleventh to the eleventh. Among the four people, Ai seemed to be the most skilled in technology. The American group attacked Brugnon at times, but with great efforts, the French group managed to win the second set with a score of thirteen to eleven.</p>
<p>The Third Set Also Belongs to the United States: The competition in the third set was no less intense than before. Brugnon's ball skills were the most legitimate. The French team took the lead by three to one, but the United States regained its balance with a score of three to three. At this point, both sides showed a state of exhaustion, and the ball slowed down accordingly. The score reached five to five. As a result, the United States won the third set with a score of seven to five.</p>
<p>Allison Lost Due to Fatigue: After a ten-minute break, the players returned to the court. The French team seemed to have benefited from the break and showed an advantage. At this time, the ball was very fast. All four were standing at the baseline and waited for the ball to arrive before returning it. The landing points were extremely accurate, and the victory or defeat was undecided for a while. The audience was breathless. Allison was quite tired, so the opponent focused on attacking Allison. The French team won the fourth set with a score of six to four, and the two sides were evenly matched, each winning two sets, so they decided on the final victory or defeat.</p>
<p>The American Group Finally Succeeded: At the beginning of the fifth set, the two teams were careful in everything and made no mistakes. The ball was fast, and the ball skills were strict. The French team attacked Van Ryn. Although Allison was very tired, his courage did not diminish, and he tried his best to assist Van. So the score reached three to three. But in the seventh game, Cochet's serve failed and the American team worked harder. Although the French team tried to save the situation, the situation had gone and there was nothing they could do. The United States won the final set with a score of six to four. The final score was six to three, eleven to thirteen, seven to five, four to six, and six to four. The game lasted for two and a half hours. As a result of the two days, France still took the lead with a score of two to one.</p>

<p>Terror Caused by the Defeat in Doubles</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 30th: After the American team won the Davis Cup doubles match, it became a question of who the brilliant Davis Cup would belong to. The singles matches tomorrow will be Borotra against Allison and Cochet against Van Ryn, but Borotra fought Van Ryn after yesterday's war and is still resting and recovering tonight. Cochet's ball skills in today's doubles match were not perfect, so when he meets Van Ryn tomorrow, Cochet cannot win, and can only try his best to support him to preserve his reputation. If France wants to win, then Borotra's ball skills are the most important question. Among the four people in today's doubles, it is fair to say that Brugnon is the best, and the rest are far behind.</p>
<p>(3) Two Exhibition Matches</p>
<p>Mrs. Marty Shows Her Skills</p>
<p>Paris Electric, 30th: After the Davis Cup doubles match ended, there was another doubles exhibition match to entertain the audience. One side was Mrs. Marty and Puches, and the other was Mrs. Mielan and Mattio. As a result, Marty and Pu won with a score of six to three and seven to five. There was another singles exhibition match, Bellna against Fan Lai. Bell won the first set with a score of six to four, but the game was suspended due to rain.</p>
<h3>Summer Football League and Inter-Bank Cup</h3>
<p>Thirteen Teams Participate in the League, Five Teams in the Inter-Bank Cup</p>
<p>The Summer Football League and Inter-Bank Cup competitions, an unprecedented initiative, closed registration yesterday. A total of thirteen teams have officially joined the Summer League, and five teams have joined the Inter-Bank Cup. The two competitions are scheduled to kick off on August 13. The names of the participating teams are listed below.</p>
<p>Summer League: Qinghua, Starlight, Yuqing, Lingnan A, Lingnan B, Huadong Company, Zhihua, Yuequn, Jinde, Qiangnan, Qunhua, Qingnian, Dajiang.</p>
<p>Inter-Bank Cup: Taiping Insurance Company, Zhonghua Book Company, Postal Team, Land Bureau, Biefa Foreign Company.</p>
<h3>Chinese Baseball Team Loses Practice Match</h3>
<p>McLins Wins with a Score of Eleven to Zero</p>
<p>The Chinese baseball team played a second practice match against the McLins B team at the Chinese baseball field yesterday. The game started at 4:00 PM and lasted seven innings. The McLins won by a score of eleven to zero.</p>
<p>Comparing the strength of the two sides, the Chinese team's ball skills are not yet fully developed. Although there are one or two sound players, there are quite a few shortcomings in general. After a full time of processing and practice yesterday, it is not easy to become a strong enemy. The McLins' skills are good, but they are not top-notch.</p>
<p>The biggest scar suffered by the Chinese team, which led to a slump, was the loss of eight points in the fifth inning. At first, the walls were tight. Although slightly attacked, it was still full of life. In the fifth inning, the Chinese team had failures because (1) the arm strength of the pitcher gradually became weak, (2) errors in shortstop and second base were frequently seen, (3) the outfield was not well-disposed. In addition, there were not many people in the Chinese team who were good at hitting, thus creating a one-sided situation where they could defend but not attack. The scores of each inning are as follows:</p>
<h3>French Tai Cup Pillar Cochet De</h3>
<p>Chinese ○○○○○○○○ points innings (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7)</p>
<p>McLins ○1118○X 13</p>
<h3>10th World Games</h3>
<p>Chinese Athletes Attract the Most Attention</p>
<p>Song and Liu Receive Protection from Police and Overseas Chinese When Attending the Meeting</p>
<p>In the Weightlifting Competition, French Athletes Set a New Lightweight Convention Record</p>
<p>National News, Los Angeles, 30th: Today is the first day of the official opening of the Olympic World Games. A total of 2,000 athletes from various countries joined the opening ceremony. There were 105,000 spectators, and the national emblems of 50 countries were inserted around the competition field, fluttering at the heights around the field. When the representatives of various countries stood in front of the rostrum, US Vice President Curtis declared the official opening of the Games with a very simple speech. Mr. Curtis's speech contained only fourteen words, the shortest speech of his life. As the opening speech ended, the Olympic flag in the center of the competition field was gradually raised amid the sound of cannons, and a torch was lit on a high pillar. Then, more than 2,000 athletes shouted and swore an oath. The oath was (We swear to participate in the Olympic Games, to compete faithfully, and to abide by all rules, to participate in various competitions in accordance with the true spirit of athletes, to win the honor of our country and the glory of the sports world.)</p>
<h3>Liu Changchun Protected by Police</h3>
<p>One of the Most Noticed Things at the Conference</p>
<p>One of the most noteworthy things at the opening today was that Chinese representative Liu Changchun and his instructor Mr. Song were able to arrive by car in time to attend the meeting. When Mr. Liu and others arrived, many policemen rode motorcycles to escort them. Behind them were five cars full of Chinese people. It can be said that they are the supporters of Mr. Liu. After Liu arrived, he was led to the Olympic Village, where he lived alone in a small house with the Chinese national emblem inserted on the roof.</p>
<p>Liu Changchun, the only Chinese athlete who bears the hope of the entire Chinese people, arrived with Mr. Song at the moment when the opening ceremony was held due to ship delays. Escorted by police officers, he entered the Olympic Village amid the crowd. The overseas Chinese support group cheered, applauding, and expressing welcome.</p>

<p>(2) The Honor of China and Finland</p>
<p>When the representatives of each country entered the arena, the whole audience cheered and thundered, and the welcome to Finland was particularly enthusiastic, probably because of the expulsion of Mr. Nurmi. The Chinese delegation was the smallest, but it also received warm applause.</p>

<p>Reuter, Los Angeles, 30th - The Olympics have officially opened. The entire city of Los Angeles is enveloped in the Games atmosphere. All newspapers are vying to predict which country will win which championship and which country's flag will be raised most often on the central flagpole. Everyone seems to consider this the focus of interest. Mr. Douglas from Hollywood sent an article to the local news today, predicting the future winning countries: in track and field, the United States, Finland, Germany, and Japan; in aquatics, the United States, Japan, and Germany; and in equestrian events, Sweden, the Netherlands, the United States, and Japan are the most promising.</p>
<p>(6) Olympic Anecdotes</p>
<p>A Sea of Red and Green, Like a Flower Bed (Reuter, Los Angeles, 3rd) - During the opening ceremony, the stands were filled with men and women dressed in American-style summer clothes, an endless expanse, like a flower bed. Two individuals watched the athletes intently from the stands, seemingly resigned to letting the next generation create new records: Mr. Nurmi, the Finnish world long-distance runner who was barred from competing due to amateur eligibility issues, and Mr. Kahanamoku, the Hawaiian swimmer who was eliminated in the preliminary rounds.</p>
<p>The Colors of the Athletes' Uniforms - As the athletes of each country paraded around, most wore blue shirts and white pants. Some wore green shirts and white pants with Panama hats, reminiscent of ancient Greece. The Hungarian athletes, in particular, attracted attention with their red clothing and turbans, resembling Indians. The U.S. Vice President's Fourteen-Word Speech - Vice President Curtis, acting on behalf of the President, gave a speech of only fifteen words: "I hereby officially declare the Olympic Games open today." Nearby American journalists commented that this was the shortest speech of his political career.</p>
<p>U.S. Swimmer Falls Ill - Reuter, Los Angeles, 30th - A key member of the U.S. swimming team, Lu Chai Luo Pai Zai, suffered from appendicitis and underwent surgery. He will be unable to attend the Games. On the other hand, Stanford University star Tun Bo Er, who suffers from arthritis and could not stand, was carried onto a plane and flown here.</p>
<p>Southern Oda Records Officially Recognized - Reuter, Los Angeles, 29th - The IAAF announced today that it officially recognizes Japanese athletes Chuhei Nambu's long jump of 7.98 meters and Mikio Oda's triple jump of 15.58 meters as world records.</p>
<p>(7) Two Major Competitions After the Games</p>
<p>Anglo-American International Match on August 14th</p>
<p>Outstanding Athletes Match on August 18th</p>
<p>After the World Games, all track and field athletes from the United Kingdom and the United States will participate in an Anglo-American international match in San Francisco on August 14th. The Japanese delegation has unofficially contacted the United Kingdom and the United States, requesting that this match be expanded into an Anglo-American-Japanese triangular match, but no clear response has been received yet.</p>
<p>The Chicago city government has decided to hold a match between outstanding athletes from various countries (limited to those selected for the World Games) in Chicago on August 18th. All ticket revenue will be distributed to the participating countries.</p>

<h3>The Expansion of Chi Nan University Nursing School Movement</h3>
<p>▲ Yesterday, a representative meeting of major middle schools in this city was convened ▲ It was resolved to assist the students' association of Chi Nan University in sending representatives back to Shanghai. According to the Jih Jih News, in order to expand the student organization and strengthen the nursing school's power, the Chi Nan University Nursing School Movement specially convened a representative meeting of major middle schools in this city, which was held at the school on Hart Road yesterday afternoon at 2 PM. The situation is as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Meeting Situation The meeting was held at the school on Hart Road yesterday afternoon at 2 PM. Representatives from more than ten universities, including Great China University, Faculty of Law and Political Science, Shanghai College of Law, China Public School, and Labor University, and representatives from more than fifty middle schools from the Middle School Federation attended. Lin Huan-ping, chairman of the Chi Nan University Nursing School Movement, was publicly elected to report the significance and process of convening the meeting. He then reported on the various works of the Chi Nan University Nursing School Movement and the petition in Beijing. The representative of Labor University also reported on the government's decision to suspend the school and its hopes for today's meeting.</p>
<p>▲ Meeting Results The meeting started at 2 PM and lasted until 6 PM, a total of four hours. After lengthy discussions, several resolutions were passed. In addition to asking representatives from various schools to report back to their schools and the Chi Nan University Nursing School Association to go to various schools to report on the significance and process of this nursing school movement, it was also resolved: (1) to send a telegram to the government opposing the merger of Chi Nan University, destroying education, and asking it to withdraw its order; (2) to issue a declaration supporting Chi Nan University and criticizing the inappropriateness of the education authorities; (3) to issue a letter to students across the country; (4) to issue a letter to the people across the country; (5) to print and distribute a propaganda outline, all explaining the government's facts of destroying education and its inappropriateness; (6) to appoint Labor University, Great China University, China Public School, Middle School Federation, and Chi Nan University to undertake active work.</p>
<p>▲ Nursing School Covenant In order to ensure the integrity of overseas Chinese education and protect the independence of overseas Chinese education, the Nursing School Association of the school resolutely rejected the resolution passed by the Executive Yuan on July 23rd upon the proposal of Zhu Jia-hua, Minister of Education, to merge the Faculty of Law and the Faculty of Education of the school. In addition to actively carrying out nursing school activities and strengthening internal unity, it also established a covenant: if the students of the Faculty of Law and the Faculty of Education transfer to the Faculty of Law and the Faculty of Education of Central University, or if the faculty and staff take positions at Central University, they will be the public enemy of all students in the school, expressing their determination to coexist and perish with the school and never want to go elsewhere.</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Education proposed merging the Faculty of Law and the Faculty of Education of the alma mater, the college has deeply felt that the Ministry of Education's measures are inappropriate and has strongly opposed them. The work has been very hard. Representatives Wang Wei-yin, Xin Zu-ren, Wei Xing-hua, etc., were specially sent to Beijing to petition. Although a satisfactory result has not been obtained, Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Education is still sympathetic and willing to find a solution. It is reported that the representatives returned to Shanghai yesterday and are continuing to work hard, sending telegrams to various places, vowing to achieve their goals.</p>

<h3>The Northeastern Customs Issue Amid the Blockade</h3>
<p>Japanese Attempting to Divert Goods from All Countries Through Japan Instead of China After the Puppet State Seized the Northeastern Customs, the Central Political Conference of our country decided to implement a blockade. However, due to the importance of the matter, the Ministry of Finance is still discussing it carefully. However, Japanese merchants in Shanghai have already expressed their opposition. After detailed investigation by reporters, the details obtained from all parties are recorded below:</p>
<p>Principles of Taxation According to customs principles, foreign goods shipped to the three northeastern provinces that need to be transferred by ship in Shanghai have a 15-day storage period upon import. If the customs declaration and tax payment are made on the spot according to the imported goods, the original tax can be refunded with the document when the goods are transferred to the northeast, because the tax must be paid at the northeast customs, and Shanghai serves as a transit point and does not need to pay tax. In addition, Chinese native goods shipped from Shanghai to the northeast are usually subject to half tax upon</p>
<p>export, and then another half tax upon arrival in the northeast. If the northeast customs is blockaded, all foreign goods shipped to the northeast and transferred by ship in Shanghai will not be treated as transit points. All goods will be subject to full tax as local imported goods, and native goods will not be subject to half tax but to the full amount.</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants' Opposition Japanese goods shipped to the northeast are more than those of European and American countries. Most of them are transshipped by Shanghai to Dalian steamships and Osaka commercial ships to Dalian, Yingkou, Andong, and other places. Now that we are blockading the northeast and changing to collecting full tax at the import port, the puppet state will still have to collect tax when the goods arrive in the northeast, which means that one cargo will be subject to double tax. Japanese merchants, citing the double tax collected by our country, protested to us and advocated refusing to pay.</p>
<p>Diversion of Foreign Goods Many European and American goods are shipped to the northeast, especially American tobacco leaves. Recently, Japanese merchants have been actively contacting importers and exporters of various countries, advising them not to ship goods from various countries to Harbin, the three northeastern provinces, by transshipping in Shanghai, but to ship them to Kobe, Japan. Sixteen specially dispatched commercial ships from Osaka Japan Post and other companies will specifically sail to Dalian, Niuzhuang, Andong, and other ports to transport foreign goods to the northeast, which can avoid paying double tax. The Japanese are very active in this matter.</p>
<p>Ship Tax Issues In the past, Chinese and foreign commercial ships sailing to various seaports in our country, whose ship taxes were collected by the Jianghai Customs, could pass unimpeded. The tax was collected once every three months at a rate of four cents per ton. Now that the puppet state has seized the northeastern customs, it plans to collect tonnage tax for Chinese and foreign commercial ships sailing to Shanghai and other places. This matter is already under preparation. However, reporters have learned that the authorities of various foreign commercial ships absolutely refuse to pay the ship tax collected by the puppet state, because various countries have not yet recognized the puppet state. This matter will arouse international resistance.</p>
<p>Suspension of Indemnity Payments According to the New Voice Agency, regarding the matter of suspending the payment of the Boxer Indemnity to Japan, according to diplomatic sources, although Finance Minister Song Zi-wen has made a formal statement, the formalities have not yet been completed through the diplomatic channels by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs notifying Japan. Therefore, it is difficult to observe the Japanese attitude at this time. However, according to the facts, after the northeastern customs duties were seized, the national customs revenue was in deficit. It is planned to reduce and repay loans secured by customs duties from various countries. The suspension of payments to those who directly seized the northeastern customs is certainly possible. Although it is not known whether Japan will protest, Japan may think that our country will suspend payments on the grounds that Japan is destroying international agreements and withholding northeastern customs duties used by the Chinese government to pay foreign debts and indemnities. As for the customs duties, the official does not consider the so-called double tax reported in the newspapers to be true. It is not yet known when the government will implement the blockade. Even if the blockade is implemented, the so-called double tax is an illegal act of the northeastern puppet organization. Since various countries have not recognized the puppet state, they should recognize the import and export taxes collected by our side as legal. The so-called double tax is actually Japanese propaganda.</p>
<h3>Special Martial Law Throughout the City Today</h3>
<p>Iron Gates on the Border Between the Chinese and Foreign Concessions Temporarily Closed Prohibition of All Assemblies, Associations, and Parades Today (August 1st) is the International Labor Day. The authorities of the Chinese Concession received a secret report in advance that the Communist Party would hold a demonstration at the time. It was decided to declare special martial law and strictly prevent it to maintain public order. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Prohibition of Assemblies and Parades City Public Security Bureau Chief Wen Ying-hsing stated that this city has not yet been lifted from martial law. All assemblies, associations, and parades that have not been approved by the local competent authorities are prohibited. Moreover, today is Labor Day (August 1st), and there is deep concern that the Communist Party will take the opportunity to cause trouble. Therefore, all district police stations and branches have been ordered to have all police officers on duty fully armed. Double posts will be set up on all main roads, and all supervisors of the Supervisory Office will be ordered to lead police officers from the police brigade and inspectors from women's schools to inspect pedestrians and send out reconnaissance teams to investigate. At the same time, special martial law will be declared and strict precautions will be taken to maintain local public order.</p>
<p>Special Martial Law Throughout the City The public rental concession's police stations have been ordered to be on special alert today. All Chinese and Western detectives will be dispatched to inspect pedestrians, and police cars will patrol. The precautionary measures in the western district of Shanghai, where factories and schools are densely populated, are particularly strict. Assemblies and parades are strictly prohibited. The French Concession police stations have been ordered to dispatch patrols to the main roads to inspect pedestrians. All iron gates on the border between the Chinese and French Concessions will be closed at 4 AM this morning, leaving only the small doors on the sidewalks open, and additional Western police officers will be stationed.</p>
<p>Discovery of Reactionary Slogans The City Public Security Bureau, the public rental concession's General Police Station, and the French Concession police station heard reports in advance that the Communist Party would hold a National Congress of Representatives of All Provinces and Cities on August 1st and a demonstration. In order to maintain local public order, the three agencies have jointly consulted on measures to ban them, implement temporary special martial law, and implement the ban. In fact, it will inevitably be impossible to implement. However, last night there were many reactionary slogans written in white pen on the telephone poles and walls on the Fourth Road and in the eastern and western districts of Shanghai. The authorities are currently conducting strict investigations.</p>
<h3>Blood Soul Extermination Corps</h3>
<p>Warning to Three Companies</p>
<p>Disposal Method for Electrical Materials Concerning Conference Inventory: Warning to Three Companies. Yesterday, the Blood Soul Extermination Corps sent letters of warning to the three major Shanghai companies, Sincere, Sun Sun, and Wing On, stating: "Esteemed Sirs, your companies are of grand scale and strong business acumen, leading the Chinese merchants at sea. If you could strive for national industry, your future would be limitless. However, your companies do not prioritize national interests, and indirectly promote Japanese goods, thus strengthening the power of violent Japan, and intensifying its invasion of us. This is extremely heartbreaking. Therefore, we send this special letter of warning, hoping that from now on, you will stand on the side of the nation and strive for national industry, absolutely refusing to sell enemy goods, and not eating the leftovers of others. We also hope that within one week, you will seal up all Japanese goods and make a statement in the newspapers. At that time, our group will send personnel to investigate. If your companies are still found to be selling Japanese goods, our group will not hesitate to destroy your companies in five minutes. We hope you will make a decisive decision, determining fortune and misfortune in an instant, and deciding safety and danger in a moment. The reason why this letter is not accompanied by a bomb is entirely out of respect for your company's integrity. Therefore, we send this letter to inform you. Please investigate and act accordingly. Sincerely, The Shanghai Blood Soul Extermination Corps, July 31st, addressed to Wing On Company."</p>
<p>Warning to Electrical Material Businesses: The Fulayde Electric Store at the corner of Zhejiang Road and Hubei Road, and the Tianfa Xie Electric Store on Xixinqiao Street in this city, each received a warning letter from the Shanghai Blood Soul Extermination Corps on the afternoon of the day before yesterday (the 30th). The letter vaguely stated: "It has come to our attention that you are privately importing and selling enemy goods. We hope you will quickly seal up your inventory. This is a preliminary warning. Otherwise, we will take the ultimate measures." Each letter also included a handgun bullet. It is also understood that many other businesses in the same industry have received similar warning letters at the same time. Therefore, the industry association convened a general meeting yesterday (the 31st) to discuss ways to dispose of the stockpiled enemy goods.</p>

<h3>Resolution on Proposals by Japanese Military Officers Stationed in Shanghai Regarding China</h3>
<p>To Protect Freight Transport by Force</p>
<p>According to the Shi Wen News Agency, more than thirty Japanese military officers stationed in Shanghai, including Kitaoka, Kita, Nemoto, Tanaka, Ogi, and naval officers Kakuo, Ogiwara, Yokoo, Aokiichi, Inamura, Kakusho, Owakyo, Sugiki, Ono, Fukumoto, Takashima, Yonekichi, who were newly transferred to Shanghai from Sasebo, and military attache Tashiro from the Japanese Consulate, convened a fellowship meeting at the Japanese military headquarters on North Sichuan Road at 3 p.m. yesterday. During the meeting, serious discussions were held on important issues such as the anti-Japanese boycott movement in Shanghai and dealing with our customs duties. It is reported that the discussion resulted in: (1) Regarding the anti-Japanese boycott issue, although Consul Murai has repeatedly made representations to our municipal government, no effective action has been taken to date. A new and effective approach was discussed at yesterday's meeting, which will directly demand that our municipal government authorities effectively stop it. (2) Opposing our double taxation case, Military Attache Tashiro gave a strong speech during the discussion of this issue, strongly advocating armed protection of freight transport, regardless of passing through any Chinese customs, without paying import and export taxes. If cargo ships are detained as a result, he would not hesitate to use force, and so on. This proposal received considerable sympathy from the officers present, so it was immediately resolved: (A) to jointly telegraph the government, urging it to make serious representations to the Chinese government as soon as possible; (B) If Chinese customs collect double taxes on Northeast goods any day, then if there are goods shipped from Shanghai to Northeast China, armed protection will begin immediately; (C) to notify overseas merchants that if there are goods shipped to Northeast China for dumping, they must first go to the headquarters to request military protection on the ships; (D) to send a letter to Murai, urging him to negotiate with the Shanghai municipal government to stop the Blood Soul Extermination Corps from operating everywhere.</p>
<h3>Three Japanese Warships Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Three Japanese Navy 15th Squadron torpedo boats entered port yesterday. It is reported that two of the ships came to Shanghai from the Yangtze River, and one came from the East. The warships are moored at buoys in the Yangshupu area.</p>
<h3>Conversation with Li Xianjun, Postal Worker from Northeast China</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter interviewed Li Xianjun, a postal worker from the Jilin-Heilongjiang area of Northeast China who arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. According to him, the report in the newspaper that the Central News Agency reporter's conversation with us stated that our entry into the customs was secretly assisted by a secretary in the local US Consulate is not true. He did not say this at the time, and there was no such thing at all.</p>
<h3>Northeastern Post Office Plans for Solutions</h3>
<p>Lin Shi Returned to Beijing Last Night to Report. Japan Determined to Establish Post Offices in Tianjin and Beijing</p>
<p>Regarding the Northeast postal issue after the blockade, the Ministry sent Lin Shi, Director of the Postal Administration, to Shanghai to discuss with Huang Naishu, Director of the Shanghai Postal Administration, for several days, and a result has been achieved. Lin returned to Beijing on the night express last night. Decisions have been made regarding rescuing Northeast postal personnel and preventing the establishment of Japanese post offices. As for Japan, its plans to establish post offices in Beijing and Tianjin are proceeding even more rapidly.</p>
<p>Lin Shi Returns to Beijing Last Night: Lin Shi, Director of the Postal Administration, after arriving</p>
<p>in Shanghai, discussed the Northeast postal issue and other postal affairs with Huang Naishu for several days. A plan has now been formulated. Lin is also very busy with official duties in Nanjing and could not stay in Shanghai for long, so he took the night train to Beijing at 11 p.m. last night to report on the progress of the negotiations in Shanghai to the Ministry of Communications. Lin will return to Shanghai in a few days.</p>
<p>Content of the Lin-Huang Meeting: Lin Shi's meeting with Huang Naishu in Shanghai to deal with the Northeast postal issue was quite secretive. According to inquiries made by a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency yesterday, the most important points of the Lin-Huang meeting in Shanghai were three: (1) How to ensure the safe entry of postal workers from outside the customs; (2) How to settle postal workers who have entered the customs; (3) How to prevent the establishment of Japanese post offices. Regarding the first point, senior postal officials outside the customs are currently negotiating with the Japanese side. The second point is to settle postal workers outside the customs in the four postal bureaus of Shanghai, Hankou, Beiping, and Tianjin. If there are many postal workers, they will be redistributed to the postal bureaus in important ports. At the same time, the Ministry of Communications has also decided to stop the current recruitment and replace it with postal workers from outside the customs. Regarding the third point, the General Post Office has inquired with various localities about the establishment of Japanese post offices. If it is found to be true, it will be transferred to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to protest to the Japanese side.</p>
<p>Japan Establishing Post Offices in Beijing and Tianjin: Since we blockaded Northeast postal services, Japanese expatriates in Beijing and Tianjin have been secretly active, attempting to establish Japanese post offices to establish a relationship with the Northeast. Huang Naishu, Director of the General Post Office, inquired by telegram. According to reliable information, Japan is</p>
<p>proceeding more rapidly in Beijing and Tianjin. However, in order to avoid violating international law, it will also follow the Shanghai Japanese Post Office method, using Chinese postage stamps and not using the name of a formal Japanese post office, and will be taken to the Northeast by the Japanese.</p>
<p>Expansion of the Shanghai Japanese Post Office: The Japanese Post Office established by Japanese expatriates in this city initially set up mailboxes at three locations: Osaka Wharf, Japanese Ship, and the Japanese Club. It has set up an office inside the Japanese Consulate. Now, in order to expand its operations, it plans to establish a new location outside to expand the organization. The number of Japanese expatriates sending letters is increasing every day. In order to unify affairs, the Japanese community's Executive Committee of the Civil Defense Corps and the Commercial Federation of each road have jointly formed a Postal Committee to oversee events within the Post Office.</p>
<h3>Action of Postal Worker Representatives from Various Regions in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Visited Major Factories and Paid Homage to the War Zone the Day Before Yesterday. Called on Mayor Wu Yesterday Afternoon to Solidify the Postal Base Plan. More than fifty representatives from postal worker unions across the country, after arriving in Shanghai from Beijing on the evening of the 29th, visited Huang Naishu, Director of the General Post Office, accompanied by the postal worker union on the morning of the day before yesterday, and made important statements on the recovery of the Northeast postal bureaus and the entry of Northeast employees into the customs. In the afternoon, they visited the Huacheng Tobacco Company and the Kangyuan Canning Factory and the French Water and Electricity Company. In the evening, they attended a banquet hosted by the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union. Yesterday morning, they took cars to inspect the war zone. At noon, they attended a banquet hosted by the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union at the YMCA cafeteria. After the banquet, after a short rest, the entire group went to Mayor Wu's private residence to make a sincere plea for the plan to consolidate the postal base. Mayor Wu, representing the Shanghai Postal System Research Committee, came out to meet them. The representatives made separate statements, and the conference unanimously resolved to request the Postal System Committee to abide by the principles of the plan and promptly submit the research and implementation measures to the government for implementation, so as not to fail the wishes of all postal workers and to preserve the credibility of the government representatives and various mediators. Chairman Wu represented that he and all members had accepted the principles of the plan in advance and would not only not violate them, but would also take full responsibility for soliciting the opinions of the authorities and employee representatives in the shortest possible time and formulating practical implementation measures within the scope of not violating the principles and submitting them to the government for implementation. He swore to guarantee that he would not fail the entrusted mission. The representatives were satisfied and took their leave. Also, the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions hosted a banquet at Yipinxian at 6 p.m. yesterday to welcome all the postal worker representatives and exchange opinions on the labor movement. During the banquet, toasts were exchanged, and the hosts and guests parted happily at 9 p.m.</p>
<h3>The Commercial Press Resumes Operations Today</h3>
<p>Content of the New Organization. Selection of Key Personnel. Careful Selection of Employees. Sufficient Preparation of Books. The Shanghai Commercial Press General Store is scheduled to resume operations today. Because the newspaper reporters believe that the museum has always been the central agency of our country's culture, after the January 28th Incident, it was destroyed by the Japanese army. People all over the country are saddened by this. Now, after the huge creation, within six months, it has been announced that it will resume operations, which shows the museum's efforts to contribute to education. Chinese people want to have both sadness and joy for the museum's resumption of operations. Yesterday, I visited an important employee of the museum to ask about the preparation process for the museum's resumption of operations. According to him, the museum has been destroyed for six months. During this short period of time, the museum authorities handled the aftermath and planned to resume operations. There were thousands of clues and the difficulties were unbearable. Fortunately, the Chinese people sympathized and helped, and the shareholders were enthusiastic about the cultural cause, so the museum was able to reorganize in the shortest time. The museum is very large in scale. The Shanghai General Museum includes a general affairs office and four institutes for compilation, translation, printing, publishing, and research. After this huge creation, the museum authorities reorganized the original general affairs office into a general management office in order to adapt to the current situation. The general manager is in charge of everything, and two managers assist him. Two associates are also appointed to assist the general manager. The general management office is divided into five departments: production, operation, supply, accounting, and auditing, and a secretariat and a personnel committee. General Manager Wang Yunwu also serves as the head of the production department. Manager Li Bake also serves as the head of the operations department. Manager Xia Xiaofang also serves as the head of the supply department. Associate Pan Guang serves as the head of the accounting department. Associate Bao Qinglin also serves as the head of the auditing department. The secretariat is headed by He Bocheng, Zhuang Baiyu, Liu Congqiang, Zhang Chanfen, Huang Zhongming, and others. He Bocheng serves as the chief secretary and also serves as the director of the personnel committee. In addition, Xia Xiaofang also serves as the director of the Shanghai Publishing Institute. Liu Congqiang and Kong Shie serve as the two deputy directors. In addition, two factories, a reproduction factory and a printing factory, are being established. Li Bojia and Yu Houpei serve as the directors of the two factories, and Lai Yanyu and Yin Minglu serve as the deputy directors. Under the general management office, there are publishing, sub-division, promotion, purchasing, warehousing, accounting, cashier, inspection, examination, and personnel departments, which are headed by Li Bojia, Zhuang Baiyu, Zhang Shuliang, Guo Meisheng, Wang Kangsheng, Pan Guang, Zhu Songpan, Zhang Xiongfei, Bao Qingjia, Shi Jiuyun, and others.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>The museum's original translation office has now been reorganized into an editorial board, which is subordinate to the production department and is headed by Wang Yunwu. Liu Chenglin, Chuan Yunsen, and Duan Yuhua have been appointed as full-time editors, and Li Bake, He Bocheng, Zhuang Baiyu, and Li Bojia have been appointed as part-time editors. In total, the museum's general management office has recruited more than 200 employees. Except for deputy section chiefs and above, who are appointed by the general manager, the rest are carefully reviewed and passed by the newly established personnel committee before being submitted to the general manager for approval. The selection of former employees is the main focus. The preparation of various books and stationery before the museum's resumption of operations is also very sufficient. After the Shanghai printing office was destroyed, the Beijing and Hong Kong bureaus were expanded to print textbooks for schools at all levels and major reference books with all their efforts. Tens of millions of elementary school books, millions of secondary school books, and hundreds of thousands of dictionaries and other reference books have been printed, which is enough for the needs of schools across the country. The Shanghai reproduction and printing factories will soon be ready for preparation, and the number of books published will increase even more. Because the original site of the museum's general management office in Zhabei has been completely destroyed, it has all been moved to the publishing office building of the museum on Henan Road in the Public Concession.</p>
<h3>The Chinese Society of Arts and Sciences Held its Completion Ceremony Yesterday</h3>
<p>More than 200 guests and members attended.</p>
<p>The Chinese Society of Arts and Sciences in this city has been established since 1916. It has been more than ten years since then. After the efforts of the person in charge of the association, land was purchased on Avenue Albert in the French Concession last year, and a three-story building was built. The completion ceremony was held yesterday, and the details are recorded below.</p>
<h3>History of the Association</h3>
<p>The association aims to study the truth, promote the arts and sciences, exchange knowledge, and promote culture. In 1916, it was initiated and organized by 47 students studying in Japan, including Chen Qixiu, Wang Zhaorong, and Wu Yongquan. In 1917, the Arts and Sciences magazine was published. In 1920, No. 18 Shuntai Lane, Baotong Road, was temporarily used as the general office of the association, which was equipped with a library reading room and guest rooms for members to stay. In April 1921, as more members studied in Europe, offices were established in Beijing and Guangzhou. In 1922, offices were added in the United States, Germany, Japan, and domestic Tianjin, Nanjing, Suzhou, Changsha, Liaoning, Fujian, Chengdu, Yunnan, Hangzhou, Jiangxi, and Jilin. Since 1923, the Arts and Sciences Compendium has been published. In 1925, the Arts and Sciences University was opened on Jing'an Temple Road in Shanghai. In 1930, the Arts and Sciences Middle School was planned to be established in Nanjing. In recent years, academic conferences and academic visiting groups have been organized, and art exhibitions have been held. So far, the completion of the association's address is an important page in the history of the association's development.</p>
<h3>New House Arrangement</h3>
<p>The new house is located at No. 45 Avenue Albert and is a three-story Western-style house. There is a large auditorium and dormitory on the third floor. There is a dining hall, library, and study room on the second floor. The first floor is an office, social room, etc. The arrangement of each room is very exquisite, and the library has many books on arts and sciences from various countries.</p>
<h3>Completion Ceremony</h3>
<p>The association held a completion ceremony at the new address at 3 p.m. yesterday. In addition to all the members, guests Cai Yuanpei, Ye Gongchuo, Huang Yanpei, Ni Yide, Ou Yuanhuai, Xu Gongmei, Liang Shuming, Zhou Junshang, Yin Zhiling, Li Zhaohuan, Chuan Futian, Pan Yangyao, Wang Zhiwei, municipal government representative Li Dachao, municipal party headquarters representative Mao Yun, and other 200 people attended. Chairman Chuan Shishuo, Bai Jingtian, master of ceremonies Gao Shiguang. First, Chuan Shishuo reported the purpose of the meeting, followed by Ma Zongrong, the executive director of the association, who reported the history of the association. Guests Cai Yuanpei, Liang Shuming, and others gave speeches one after another, with many encouragements for the association. At 6 o'clock, refreshments were served and photos were taken before the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Zheng Yuxiu and Wei Daoming Returned to China Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>According to Guowen News Agency, Dr. Zheng Yuxiu and Wei Daoming, the former mayor of Nanjing, returned to China yesterday afternoon at 1 p.m. on an Italian mail ship. The ship was docked at the north wharf of the China Merchants Bureau. Those who went to welcome them included officials, businessmen, academics, men, women, relatives, and friends, as well as staff and students of the Faculty of Law. About 200 people were present. As the ship approached the shore, Wei hurriedly took a car to return to his residence to mourn his mother's death. After Zheng disembarked, she shook hands with the welcomers and said to the reporter, "During my stay in Europe, I mainly paid attention to the press, first to observe the world's public opinion on the Japanese atrocities in China, and second, I examined the plans for running a newspaper in detail for reference. Europeans are now mostly aware of the Japanese atrocities, and they all judge them as violating treaties and violating humanity. However, the initial opinions of the newspapers were not entirely true, which was quite misleading. This was due to Japanese propaganda and the lack of communication in our country. Although the truth is there, we are not afraid of false rumors being buried, but the temporary misunderstanding also has a great impact. European and American newspapers are very good at using the relationship between their respective countries' interests in international affairs, and they have become diplomatic weapons. It seems that the United Kingdom is the best at this. The newspaper that I plan to run has already started to organize, order printing machines, and build a museum. It will probably be published within a few months. I also hope to contact colleagues to use the national interest issue in international policy, and at the same time, the combination of national colleagues will contact the world's press to improve publicity abroad."</p>
<h3>The Puhuitang River is Dry</h3>
<p>Villagers Urgently Hope for Dredging</p>
<p>The Puhuitang River in Shanghai is the main port for boats and ships to and from the interior and the main river for irrigating farmland in the western villages. Because of the failure to dredge in 1935, the shallow siltation was already unbearable. Recently, due to the dry weather, the entire river has dried up. The tide only reaches west of Xuhui, causing the river to dry up even more severely in the Hongqiao to Qibao section. The local farmers cannot draw water, and the crops and cotton are withered, and they are all worried and have nowhere to complain. It is heard that people in neighboring towns have been calling for dredging the pond for more than a year, but it has not been dredged due to the municipal government's indifference. The reason is nothing more than the lack of funds to allocate, but according to the current situation, it is necessary to plan for dredging as soon as possible. Otherwise, not only will merchant ships be affected, but farmland will also be harmed. Moreover, if this drought does not rain and the river dries up, the livelihood of the western Shanghai side will be even more unbearable to ask. It is heard that the villagers along the pond are deeply hoping that the municipal government will dredge the river as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Record of the Regular Meeting of the Aviation Construction Association</h3>
<p>Soliciting Aircraft and Design Committee. Since the China Aviation Construction Association began working at the Mainland Department Store on Nanjing Road, there have been several letters from all parties requesting to join the association and provide sponsorship every day. The association held a regular meeting yesterday. More than ten people, including Zhu Qinglan, Yin Zhiling, Huang Menggui, Lin Jiyong, Wang Zhaocheng, Tan Bozhi, Cha Liangzhao, and Luo Yinguo, attended. Yin Zhiling was publicly elected as chairman to discuss and propose the establishment of an aircraft solicitation committee, which would be organized by representatives of individuals or groups who recognized the association's fundraising for aircraft,</p>
<p>and a design committee, which would be organized by experts. After detailed research, the results were submitted to the board of directors this Tuesday for public resolution and implementation.</p>
<h3>The Copper, Iron, and Machinery Industry Hosted a Farewell Party for the Shaanxi Investigation Team</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Copper, Iron, and Machinery Industry Association hosted a banquet at the Dadong Restaurant yesterday to welcome the Shaanxi Investigation Team. More than ten team members, including Cheng Peiwen,</p>
<p>Tao Lide, Hu Queen, Tongren, Guo Weiping, Zhu Qiqing, Gu Zhizhong, Jiang Mingchun, and Wang Zhongwei, attended. During the banquet, Chairman Zhao Xiaolin gave a farewell speech, followed by team members Hu Queen and Guo Weiping, who gave replies and explained the significance of this trip in detail. Finally, Zhang Zilian, a member of the association, gave a speech with many encouragements. At about 9 o'clock, the hosts and guests parted happily.</p>
<h3>The Dachangzhen Disaster Relief Association Cares about Beverages</h3>
<p>More than Ten Public Wells Specially Opened</p>
<p>The Dachangzhen Disaster Relief Association, in view of the siltation of the city river and the turbidity of the water flow, is particularly concerned about hygiene for beverages. Wang Maoqing, the chairman of the association, raised more than 1,000 yuan and made more than ten special tile wells in places such as the town and Miaohang that were needed. The general residents have access to this clean beverage, and they are all grateful. It is also heard that the association plans to carry out other relief work as soon as it raises funds.</p>
<h3>Record of the Jiangsu Provincial Rice Association's Regular Meeting</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu, Nanjing, and Shanghai County Rice Industry Association held its ninth executive supervisory meeting at Cuixiu Hall yesterday. Zhu Zixiang was publicly elected as chairman, and the ceremony was performed as usual. The chairman reported on the association's previous telegram to the Ministry of Finance requesting the cancellation of the special business tax in Jiangsu Province. The Ministry of Finance replied: "Thank you for the telegram. After investigation, the special business tax planned to be handled by the Jiangsu Provincial Government has been submitted to the Executive Yuan, which ordered its cancellation. The Ministry has also recorded the order and repeatedly ordered the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance to comply. Please be informed." This is a final resolution of the special tax. Chairman Ye Huijun of the association passed away due to illness. The rice industry group is scheduled to hold a memorial service on August 13. The association has also participated and asked for recognition. The resolution was passed. It was also proposed that the Wuxi Rice Milling Industry Association sent a letter stating that Hu Congjia and others in the county misinterpreted the Yuan's order, saying that the use of stone powder in rice milling was malicious and disturbed the merchants, and asked for assistance and appeal. The resolution was to forward the appeal to the Industry Department of the Executive Yuan and the Department of Industry and ask for mercy on behalf of the merchants. Committee member Chen Junyu temporarily proposed, and Zhao Zixin and others seconded, saying that the price of rice was falling every day, the rural economy was on the verge of bankruptcy, and there was a hidden worry that it should be presented to the municipal government to temporarily limit the import of foreign rice to provide relief. The resolution was to forward it immediately.</p>
<h3>Vietnamese Industrialists Come to Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to Guowen News Agency, there are no less than one million overseas Chinese in Vietnam. For the past sixty or seventy years, the operation of agriculture, industry, and commerce has become increasingly developed. In recent years, due to the French government's change to the gold standard system, the economy has been severely hit. Those with a slightly longer-term vision have mostly transferred their capital to the country to develop the motherland's industry. Wei Shaobo is one of them. Wei is from Sanshui County, Guangdong Province, and has been in Vietnam for more than ten years. He founded the Er Tiantang Pharmacy in Vietnam, Di An, Phnom Penh, and other ports. He is usually enthusiastic about public welfare and does not give way, so he is the one to whom special expectations are placed. He has been promoted to be the head of the Guangzhao Gang and the chairman of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce. In recent years, he has returned to China and set up Er Tiantang branches in Guangzhou and Hong Kong. This spring, he planned to set up a Shanghai branch at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Laobazi Road. Due to the January 28th Incident, it was slightly suspended. Now it has been fully installed and has been supported by key figures in the National Government and celebrities in Shanghai, who have given inscriptions in abundance. The opening ceremony will be held today (August 1). Wei has come to Shanghai a few days ago to direct everything.</p>
<h3>The Federation of Charitable Organizations Asks to Continue the Free Period for Relief Supplies</h3>
<p>Yesterday, letters were sent to various organizations listing their titles and sending telegrams.</p>
<p>The measures for tax and free transport of relief supplies have been ordered by the Executive Yuan to expire at the end of June and will not be extended. The Federation of Charitable Organizations in this city now intends to jointly telegram the Executive Yuan with the relevant organizations to withdraw this decision so that tens of thousands of refugees can survive. Moreover, because the Ministry of Railways has defamed the character of Chinese and foreign charitable organizations in its submissions to the Yuan, it is also intended to request a thorough investigation and strict handling. Therefore, the drafted telegrams to the Yuan were specially sent to the Shanghai Red Cross Society, the Red Swastika Society, the Hua Yang Relief Association, the Xinwei Relief Shanghai Society, the Jiangsu Flood Relief Association, the Jiangnan Flood Relief Emergency Association, the Hunan Flood Association Office, the China Jiesheng Society, the China Moral Society, the Anhui Shanghai Fellow Villagers Relief Association, and other relevant organizations to solicit their names to be telegraphed. The association's letters and telegrams are recorded below:</p>
<h3>To All Organizations: Original Letter</h3>
<p>To whom it may concern: It has been approved by the Relief Affairs Committee and notified in a letter. It was ordered by the Executive Yuan No. 2055. According to a report from the Ministry of Railways, tax and fee exemptions for the transportation of relief goods have led to abuses over time, resulting in losses of more than two million yuan for various railways. It was requested that these exemptions not be extended after they expire at the end of last month. This was approved by the 46th Yuan meeting, etc. Alas, our country is unfortunate, with disasters occurring year after year. Relief organizations run around appealing and rescuing with heartfelt sincerity, without any personal gain. Unexpectedly, this righteous act of supporting those in need has been smeared with the bad reputation of treacherous merchants and unscrupulous gentry. The Ministry of Railways, in its dispute over transportation costs, does not hesitate to confuse right and wrong and make unfounded accusations, thereby destroying the credibility of relief efforts and cutting off the lifeline of disaster victims. We will not debate the issue of reputation for the time being, but the facts must be contested. We plan to jointly petition the Executive Yuan with various charitable organizations, requesting them to withdraw their order and extend the period for transporting relief goods with tax and fee exemptions, so that these tens of thousands of disaster victims can survive. Attached is a draft telegram. If you agree, please reply promptly so that we can borrow your title and jointly send it. Furthermore, the Relief Affairs Committee has sent a letter to your organization, which you have likely already noticed, so there is no need to repeat it here.</p>
<h3>Draft Telegram to the Executive Yuan</h3>
<p>To Premier Wang of the Executive Yuan in Nanjing, (omitted above)... The public is outraged and cannot remain silent. Investigating and providing relief is an important administrative task of the state. The people usually fulfill their obligation to pay taxes and serve in the military. When disasters occur, it is reasonable and legal for the government to rescue and assist them. Recently, disasters have been reported one after another in various provinces, compounded by internal strife and external wars. The refugees wander in the wilderness, a scene too horrible to bear. The government is busy dealing with emergencies and has no time to care for the helpless disaster victims. Fortunately, charitable organizations both domestic and foreign have embraced compassion and sought to provide relief. The relief efforts for Shaanxi, Henan, and the sixteen provinces affected by last year's floods, as well as the relief efforts for the national crisis in the Northeast and Shanghai, have saved countless lives, numbering in the tens of millions. The funds donated for relief amount to hundreds of millions. If the Ministry of Railways could truly empathize with the government and prioritize the needs of the hungry, free transportation would be a duty it should fulfill, so how can they speak of losses? However, the original report claims that treacherous merchants and unscrupulous gentry collude in relief efforts, transport sample rice, and secretly solicit business, making indiscriminate and unfounded accusations. For the sake of disputing a small amount of disaster relief transportation revenue, they do not hesitate to confuse right and wrong and put it in official documents, cutting off the livelihoods of the disaster victims in various provinces and tarnishing the reputation of charitable organizations both domestic and foreign. What about the organizations? What about the lives of the people? If people's hearts are different, and the relief workers truly have the aforementioned facts, the government should thoroughly investigate and punish them. If they knowingly condone it, what about the national law? If someone were to imitate their tone and say that various railways collude with treacherous merchants to engage in corruption and malpractice, and should be abolished, what would your esteemed Yuan do? In short, disaster relief is one matter, and malpractice is another. Our association, etc., lament the country's difficulties and are saddened by the great calamity. We cannot bear to speak out, so we specially jointly appeal to your esteemed Yuan to consider the people as the foundation of the country and food as the foundation of the people, to approve the withdrawal of your order and extend the tax and fee exemptions. At the same time, thoroughly investigate the facts of malpractice and strictly punish them, so as to maintain relief efforts and uphold the law. We await your orders with utmost apprehension.</p>
<p>We respectfully submit this petition and implore you to consider it.</p>

<h3>Zhang Zhiren's Second Suicide Attempt</h3>
<p>The letters left behind are filled with words of concern for the country and indignation at the world. Zhang Zhiren, former secretary of the Shanghai News Reporters Association and a native of Rugao, Jiangsu Province, was 26 years old. Due to environmental factors, his nerves were severely stimulated, and he attempted suicide by jumping into the Huangpu River in April of this year. Fortunately, he was rescued and taken back to his hometown to recuperate by his uncle, Zhang Ruiting. His position as secretary of the Reporters Association was also placed on long-term leave. The Reporters Association has now been reorganized into the Journalists Association and moved its location to 279 Wangping Street. Because Zhang had been recuperating at home for a long time, he urgently needed to make a living. Through the introduction of a fellow villager and friend, he planned to work at the Journalists Association. He came to Shanghai on the 30th and temporarily stayed at the association. Unexpectedly, after reading the newspaper, he was once again affected by the political situation, which caused his old illness to recur. Suddenly, at 7:30 yesterday morning, while the tea servant was tidying up the association, he used scissors to stab his throat and fainted in a pool of blood. After being notified, the association staff reported to the police station and sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment. A draft of a letter to his uncle was found in his pocket, filled with words of concern for the country and indignation at the world (the original draft is stored in the police station). According to the doctor, there were more than twenty stab wounds on his throat. Although the trachea was injured, his mind was still clear, and there was still hope for recovery. An operation was immediately performed. The association has already telegraphed his family to come to Shanghai to take care of him.</p>
<h3>Gambling Led to a Fatality</h3>
<p>A Fishing Boat Crew Member Drowned</p>
<p>Recently, the southeast wind has been strong, and most cargo sailing ships dare not leave the port, anchoring opposite Wusong, in Pudong and the Zhanghuabang area, waiting for the wind to calm down before departing. The fishing boat "Jin Shunli" from Sizhou also anchored in Pudong, waiting for the wind to subside. The night before last, the crew members of the boat were playing poker on the boat. At around 10:00 PM, patrol boats of the Fourth Division of the Municipal Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol Team spotted the boat gambling. The police boarded the boat to arrest the gamblers. Crew member Ye Acai, 25 years old, fled in fear of punishment because he was supporting a young family. He was apprehended by the police and dragged to the patrol boat. Ye suddenly fell into the water. The Jin Shunli and other crew members saw Ye fall into the water and immediately tried to rescue him, but failed. The Water Patrol Team, seeing Ye fall into the water, retreated by rowing away. Liu, the captain of the Jin Shunli, reported to the Lifesaving Bureau to pay attention to the body and telegraphed Ye Acai's family to come to Shanghai, intending to negotiate with the Water Patrol Team.</p>
<h3>Husband Earns 200 Gold Monthly, Wife Only Gets 4 Yuan for Living Expenses</h3>
<p>Sun is having an affair and neglects his wife. Wife hires a lawyer to mediate. Sun Tiezhu, from Wuxi, is nearing his fifties. He is currently employed at the Northern Railway Station General Engineering Office, earning a monthly salary of over 200 gold. His first wife, Wang, is also of considerable age, and has been abandoned by Sun in their hometown, receiving only 2 yuan per month for living expenses. She lives a life of hardship and is in debt, making it difficult to survive. Therefore, she requested her husband to increase her allowance time and again. Sun only agreed to add 2 yuan per month. Wang believes that since Sun has surplus money to take a concubine, he cannot shirk his responsibility to support his first wife. She has hired lawyer Yin Jingzhi and submitted a petition to the Mediation Office of the First Special District Local Court, requesting Sun to be summoned to mediate. The petition roughly states that Sun is having an affair and neglecting his wife, failing to provide support, and requests the court to summon him for mediation. The petitioner lost her parents at a young age. At the age of eleven, her paternal grandmother arranged for her to become Sun's child bride. At the age of twenty-five, she formally married Sun and became his wife. In 1920, Sun began his business. Initially, he did not forget his wife, sending money home every month. Later, he stopped providing support altogether, not even a penny. Eventually, there was no news from him. Furthermore, the family only has four mu of thin land and several mulberry trees. The annual income from this is only 23-24 yuan, averaging 2 yuan per month. How can one survive on such a small amount? She borrowed money everywhere, but over the years, she accumulated a mountain of debt. Now, she has no way to borrow money and is forced to wait for death. She was forced to temporarily seek refuge in a nearby nunnery. Recently, someone returned from Shanghai and mentioned that Sun is now employed as a high-ranking official at the Northern Railway Station General Engineering Office. They also said that he had taken a concubine several years ago and rented a house at 1037 Siwen Lane, Xinzha Road. They live together as husband and wife, and employ servants, living like a wealthy family. He has completely forgotten his first wife, not caring or inquiring about her. His heart is so cruel that it is unbearable. Therefore, she authorizes lawyer Yin Jingzhi to act as her full representative, requesting your court to set a date for mediation, which would be a great kindness. Because Sun Jianrong did not provide support, Wang was unable to stay in Shanghai to testify, although the case was filed in Shanghai. Lawyer Yin took the petition to a nunnery in Wuxi a few days ago to have Wang sign it, and then brought it back to Shanghai. It has already been submitted, and the court hearing is expected to be held soon.</p>
<h3>Wang Jinye Seals Up Old Enemy Goods</h3>
<p>In order to thoroughly resolve the issue of enemy goods, the Hardware Trade Association specially convened a general meeting of members yesterday. It was resolved that, starting from today, the old stock of enemy goods held by the trade should be transferred to the public warehouse to avoid confusion. All detailed measures will be implemented by the inspection team.</p>
<h3>Shen Bao Holds Photography Exhibition</h3>
<p>Location: Chinese Arts and Crafts Society</p>
<p>The Shen Bao News Photography Society has been established for four years, specializing in taking photos of current events for publication. During the Shanghai War, the society's reporters went to the front lines of both sides to take 400-500 kinds of authentic war photos. Some of them have already appeared in various newspapers and magazines. This time, with the completion of the new building of the Chinese Arts and Crafts Society, two rooms have been specially opened and invited to join the exhibition. Due to limitations of time and space, 100 systematic war photos have been specially selected for display in one room. In another room, there are dozens of Li Zunyong's artistic works and current affairs photos related to the seasons, as well as Ge Gongzhen's Northeast survey photos. The time is set for one week from August 1st. The location is Rooms 1 and 2 at the entrance of the Chinese Arts and Crafts Society at 45 Jinshenfu Road (Aimaier Yu Road). Visitors can see the general situation of the Shanghai Incident and the puppet state.</p>
<h3>Opening of the Minhang Plague Hospital</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of summer, the county's various townships have been plagued by epidemics. The First District Office has temporarily taken over the remaining buildings of the Minyuan in this town to organize the Shanghai County Temporary Plague Hospital. With the approval of the county government and the economic subsidy of the Chinese Red Cross Society, the district has been instructed to actively prepare. It officially opened on the 29th and began providing treatment. The hospital is clean and staffed by doctors with rich knowledge, especially experienced in epidemics. Patients who wish to be hospitalized will be charged a small fee for first and second class wards, while third class wards and outpatient clinics are treated free of charge, benefiting the poor and sick. Therefore, the number of people seeking medical treatment is quite high.</p>

<h3>Municipal Government Invites Reporters to Visit the Seaside Bathing Beach</h3>
<p>And Observe the Municipal Ferry Management Office</p>
<p>In response to the needs of the citizens, the Municipal Public Works Bureau has specially established a seaside bathing beach in Gaoqiao, Pudong, to facilitate citizens going swimming in the summer. Although the bathing beach is limited by the tight municipal finances and cannot be immediately equipped perfectly, the emergency plan for this year has been implemented in order. The first step of the work has been completed, such as repairing roads, building food and beverage places, dressing rooms, and setting up tents, etc., have been realized. As for large-scale plans, such as the construction of swimming pools and roads, as soon as funds are available, construction will begin. Yesterday, the Municipal Government specially invited reporters from various newspapers and news agencies to visit, hosted by Chen Kecheng, Chen Xunshe, representatives of the Municipal Government, Tan Boying, Section Chief of the Fourth Section of the Municipal Public Works Bureau, etc. At 8:45 in the morning, the reporters arrived one after another, with more than 50 people in total. They immediately boarded the No. 3 Municipal Public Works Bureau ferry, which sailed north at 9:00. At 10:20, they arrived at Gaoqiao Ferry. After landing, they first took two public buses to Gaoqiao Town Station, and then transferred to rickshaws hired by the Municipal Government to go to the seaside bathing beach.</p>
<h3>Reporters Try Bathing</h3>
<p>At 11:30, they gathered at the seaside bathing beach. The representatives of the Municipal Government invited the reporters to enter the dining area and provided tea and snacks. After the refreshments, Section Chief Tan led a tour around the site. Reporters who were good swimmers put on the bathing suits available on site and entered the water to try bathing, with great interest. The bathing beach facilities are already taking shape. A dining area that can accommodate 100 people has been built on the beach, with tables and chairs, and is equipped with cold snacks, pastries, and other food to relieve the hunger and thirst of swimmers. Ten dressing rooms have been built next to it for swimmers to change clothes and store clothes. In addition, many tents have been made available. Swimmers can borrow them from the management office. The equipment can be described as perfect.</p>
<h3>Lunch in Donggou</h3>
<p>After wandering for about an hour and a half, they left the site in an orderly manner, took a bus back to Gaoqiao, boarded the ferry to Donggou at 1:40, and arrived at Donggou at 2:00. They landed and went to the Municipal Ferry General Management Office. The Public Works Bureau had set up a banquet in advance at the General Management Office to entertain the reporters. After a short rest, the reporters entered the banquet. Chen Kecheng, a representative of the Municipal Government, stood up to give a speech, saying that he was very honored that the reporters had taken the trouble to come to visit the seaside bathing beach, and he apologized for the inadequate reception. He hoped for their understanding, etc. Then, Chen introduced Tan Boying, Section Chief of the Fourth Section of the Public Works Bureau, to report on the history of the opening of the seaside bathing beach and the future plans, and reported the business situation of the Municipal Ferry in detail. The following is a record of his speech:</p>
<h3>Tan Boying's Report</h3>
<p>Tan Boying, Section Chief of the Transportation Section of the Municipal Public Works Bureau, stood up halfway through the banquet to deliver a welcome speech, and elaborated on the construction of the seaside bathing beach and the Municipal Ferry. He said that it was an honor that everyone had taken the trouble to come to visit the seaside bathing beach, braving the heat. The preparations of our bureau are crude and the reception is inadequate. We hope for your forgiveness and guidance. The seaside bathing beach visited today was first</p>
<h3>Discovered by Foreigners</h3>
<p>Because the location is remote, in the northeast of Gaoqiao, Pudong, with a flat and exceptionally smooth beach. From shallow to deep, it forms a slope with the sea water. It is a natural swimming pool, but most people in Shanghai have not paid attention to it. It was not until foreigners came to Pudong for hunting in the spring and summer that they discovered this place. Therefore, every summer, they would form groups, set up fences and tents, and rest here. The bureau saw that more and more foreigners were coming to Pudong, but it did not know their purpose at first. Therefore, it tracked and investigated them, and finally</p>
<p>knew the whole story.</p>
<h3>The Construction Process</h3>
<p>The bureau saw that this city had this natural attraction, and it should be developed into a good swimming pool for the citizens to exercise their bodies. Therefore, it was decided to plan the construction. The plan was submitted to the Municipal Government for approval last year, and was approved by Mayor Zhang. However, due to lack of funds, it could not be carried out. Later, after Mayor Wu took over, he agreed to allocate 2,000 yuan from the surplus of the Municipal Ferry to prepare for construction first. Just as the construction was about to begin, the Sino-Japanese Incident occurred, and it was stopped again. It was not until the middle of this month that several wooden houses were built, and dressing rooms, storage rooms, and wine stalls were set up for swimmers to eat, rest, and change clothes. Wooden poles marking the depth of the water were erected to show the depth of the water, so that swimmers could avoid danger. Several lifeguards were hired to be dispatched immediately in case of an accident. All of these were completed within half a month. Although the scale is crude, tourists have found it much more convenient, and the 2,000 yuan of funds has not been completely used up.</p>
<h3>Future Plans</h3>
<p>Although the initial work of the field has been completed, we will never be satisfied with this. The site is located in the northeast of Gaoqiao, about seven or eight li from the ferry. If you follow the existing road, it is winding and inconvenient. It costs a large sum of one yuan to take a rickshaw, so we decided to build a straight road to the site, which can save about four li. Public buses will run back and forth to facilitate passengers. In terms of security, the Public Security Bureau will be asked to increase the number of police officers and special commissioners to protect it. In terms of hygiene, unclean vendors and overnight food will also be cracked down. The bathing area will also be equipped with more rescue equipment and diving boards. All resistance or unreasonable trouble from ignorant people during the process will not be considered, in order to add a noble entertainment place for citizens to exercise their bodies.</p>
<h3>The History of Changing Ships</h3>
<p>The origin of the original ferry of the Municipal Government was at the beginning of the establishment of the Municipal Government, the handover of three small wheels from the Tanggong Relief Bureau, running between Chegou and Shanghai. Sixteen years ago, the ferry was presided over by Mr. Zhu Futian. After the Municipal Government took over, it was determined to improve it. Because of the hard work and labor of all the employees and the saving of coal consumption, there was a surplus every year. After the ferry expenses became independent, it borrowed money from foreigners to build the Donggou Wharf and the No. 1 and No. 2 new ships. After the new ships were in operation, after about a year, the surplus was completely paid off. Then it borrowed 360,000 yuan from the Municipal Bank to build No. 3 and No. 4 ships and several cross-river ferries at the Sixteenth Wharf. A new wharf has also been built in Gaoqiao, and 140,000 yuan has been returned to the Municipal Bank. There is still 120,000 yuan left, which can be paid off in about March next year. Then all the property of the Municipal Ferry will be worth more than 700,000 yuan. This is all created by the concerted efforts of all employees, their hard work and perseverance.</p>
<h3>Evening Special Ship Returns to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The banquet ended at 3:30. Section Chief Tan led the reporters to visit the Municipal Ferry General Management Office and the Municipal Garden. After the visit, it was already 4:30. They boarded the special ship and returned to Shanghai, arriving at the port at 5:10 in the evening.</p>
<h3>Association for Promoting National Products</h3>
<p>Prize Offered for Solicitation of Association Emblem</p>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' Association for Promoting National Products was initiated by Feng Shaoshan, Chen Yiting, Jian Zhaonan, Huo Shouhua, Chen Shanbao, Yu Qiaqing and other pioneers in the national products industry and was announced on November 11, 1920, to promote national products, revitalize industry, improve technology, and promote trade, as the four major goals, and stipulated (passively boycott Japanese goods, actively promote national products,) two slogans, as the permanent standard of service, working hard for the national product movement, always unswervingly, fighting for everything that is beneficial to the national product business, and being successful, the national product factories in Shanghai and the citizens of all walks of life have more firm beliefs, and the sponsorship is especially powerful, and the association's affairs are becoming more and more prosperous. Since the end of the January 28th Shanghai Incident and the signing of the agreement, enemy goods have used dumping policies and implemented new economic aggression, with dangerous situations arising, and there is a risk of bankruptcy. In order to save the fate of national products and awaken national consciousness, the association has sent telegrams to legal organizations such as national product associations in provinces, cities, counties, and townships across the country to expand the promotion of national product propaganda and jointly face the national crisis, and has stepped up its work and actively carried out new membership applications, issued national product certificates, organized propaganda teams, and went to the townships along the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou railway to give speeches, led tour groups, departed to various provinces and cities, and held mobile national product exhibitions to promote and resist. In order to promote the spirit of the association and awaken the attention of the people, it is planned to build an association emblem to show the sign. After the 25th meeting of the 12th session of the Standing Committee, the original circular association emblem composed of the four characters for "Promoting National Products" lacked obvious and vivid power and was abandoned. Another newspaper was published to solicit meeting styles to meet the needs of the case. All domestic and foreign compatriots, both men and women, who are enthusiastic about the national product movement, and have the patriotic enthusiasm and national duty to use their ingenuity and ink to paint clear and concise, in line with the association's purpose, and deeply meaningful association emblem styles, with detailed instructions, should be sent directly to the association's secretariat in Jiumudi. Once selected, a national currency of ten yuan will be awarded to reward the elegant meaning. Please indicate the name, address, and seal on the submissions.</p>
<h3>French Newspaper</h3>
<p>Russian Female Accountant Shot and Robbed, Severely Wounded</p>
<p>The Continental News reports that yesterday (30th) in the robbery case at the French Shanghai Daily, the robbers shot and hit Ms. Clara Mairenko, a Russian female accountant. The bullet penetrated her left lung and she was seriously injured. She is currently staying in Guangci Hospital. Last night she was still fighting with death and it is unknown if she will be able to escape the danger. At that time, the Russian woman went to the Banque de l'Indochine to withdraw 1,600 yuan to pay salaries, and when she walked to the head of the escalator on the second floor, two teenagers suddenly came out to block the way. One of them said in English (Madam, too hard,) When the woman was about to stop, the other person took out a pistol from his pocket and fired a shot at her chest. Then the robber who shouted "too hard" grabbed the bag of banknotes from her hand, stepped over the woman's body together with the shooter, and fled downstairs. At that time, there was a doorman policeman a few feet away from the scene of the incident who was patrolling and was awakened by the gunshot and the Russian woman's cries, and immediately got up to chase, and the doorman policeman of the neighboring house also wanted to chase, but they were scared by the robbers pointing their guns at them and only watched them go towards Gongguan Road. The Russian policeman on duty at St. Anne's Building also chased them, but was also frightened by the gun when he reached Lao Yong'an Street, and only saw the two robbers rush into the Yangtze Motor Company and escape into the Chinese territory through the alley behind the door. The two robbers seemed to be familiar with the Russian woman's actions, and saw her go to the bank to withdraw money, so they waited at the head of the stairs, and after the robbery, the escape route seemed to be planned in advance.</p>
<h3>YWCA</h3>
<p>20th Graduation Ceremony of the People's School</p>
<p>The YWCA at 392 Nanjing Road has been working hard for people's education for many years and has spared no effort. Although this year was affected by the war, it still tried to continue classes, so that out-of-school women would not lose their opportunity to learn because of the national crisis. There are a total of four schools, located on Laobishang Road, Zhaofeng Road, Pudong, and Yangshupu. There are a total of 275 students. The 20th graduation ceremony was held yesterday. There were 72 graduates, including 58 in the elementary level and 14 in the advanced level. The order included a lecture by Mr. Mao Zhongying from the Jiangsu Provincial Education Institute's People's Education Experimental Zone and performances by the graduates. It is said that at the beginning of the autumn semester, the number of students will be expanded even further. All out-of-school adults, regardless of whether they have a job or not, can go to report. No tuition is charged for admission.</p>
<h3>Dispute over Patrol Fees in Chongshanfang</h3>
<p>The houses in Chongshanfang, Tangshan Road, Hongkou, have been renovated since last winter and will be completed this spring. The Shanghai War broke out, the workers dispersed, and the construction was stopped. After the Japanese army withdrew, the interior project was completed at the beginning of May, so the shops and tenants moved in in May. Last month, the Municipal Council collected patrol fees, and only ordered the tenants of the Fang to pay one month of summer June fees. The fee collector gave a receipt and collected the money as usual. Afterwards, Liu Shidetang, the landlord of the Fang, in order to force the tenants to rent from April 1, tried to use the Municipal Council's fee collection time issue, voluntarily paid three months of summer patrol fees, and commissioned its management company, Jinxing Real Estate Company, to ask the fee-collecting foreigners to order the tenants to pay the fees for April and May. The tenants refused. A few days ago, the tenants' union of the Fang jointly wrote to the Chinese Taxpayers Association, requesting them to declare to the Municipal Council on their behalf that they were being used by the landlord.</p>
<h3>Man Lay Naked on Tracks</h3>
<p>Crushed to Death by Train</p>
<p>At 7:45 am the day before yesterday, the early train from Nanjing to Shanghai was traveling near Xiaoyangqiao railway, Jiaotong Road, Zhabei when a man, about 30 years old, was lying naked on the tracks and was crushed to death by the train. His body was crushed into several pieces, his flesh and blood blurred, a terrible sight. The Third Precinct of the Fourth District ordered Hou Aiting, the local security officer of Jin 24th Tu, to report to the local court for inspection.</p>
<h3>Fire in Guangqi Road</h3>
<p>According to the follow-up investigation of the Nanshi fire news reported in this newspaper yesterday, the home of Mao Jifa at 110 Guangqi Road in the city suddenly broke through the roof on fire at 2:30 am yesterday (31st), with flames reaching the sky. The neighbors nearby were all scrambling to move furniture, boxes, and cages, and the order was in chaos. Fortunately, the fire brigades of various districts heard the alarm and drove to the scene to put out the fire. The fire was extinguished at around 4:00 am. After that, Bao, the director of the Second Precinct of the First District, sent police to investigate the cause of the fire and took the fire starter Mao Jifa to the precinct for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Re-discussing Abolishing Taels and Changing to Yuan, and Answering Mr. Wu Jingxiong – Ma Yinchu</h3>
<p>The previous article published in the newspaper, "My Opinion on Abolishing Taels and Using Yuan," was the speech I delivered at Shanghai Jiaotong University. It was recorded by Huang Shitong, a brilliant student of Jiaotong University. I found the record to be excellent, so I specially published it. The issue of abolishing taels and changing to yuan is not just a financial matter, but has become a major social issue today. As a university professor, I naturally have the duty to discuss it in detail with contemporary youth. However, my friend Mr. Wu Jingxiong mistakenly thought there was another purpose, and wrote a long article to debate it. Mr. Wu might have written it with pleasure, but some of the arguments were forced and not thoroughly examined. As for Yinchu, since I have received guidance from an old friend, I must also follow his advice and conduct further research. I will now explain it item by item: (1) The purpose of the article is solely for the young students, to make them understand the difficulties in abolishing taels and using yuan today. It has no other purpose. I am not a regular consultant to any bank, and I have never received any substantial compensation in normal times. Therefore, there is no need for me to publish any opinions on behalf of the banks. Moreover, since I returned to China in the fourth year of the Republic, I have published short essays on unifying the currency system. It has been eighteen years since then, and I regret the slow progress in its realization. This time, I have the opportunity to enlighten the wisdom of the youth, so that they have sufficient knowledge and in-depth research on economic current affairs, and use it to concentrate the revolutionary power of the youth. Is the effect far-reaching? (2) Furthermore, my purpose is to make students understand that in China today, whenever someone does something, someone else comes out to obstruct it. If it is to seek progress for society and expressed in writing, those who join in the discussion are welcome. However, if someone attacks arbitrarily without asking for the reason, and opposes it with anti-evolutionary actions, then if it is not corrected, the confusing effect on public opinion will poison the entire society. This time, abolishing taels and changing to yuan is indeed a great benefit to society, but some insist on opposing it and act in reverse, or use anti-evolutionary arguments for pleasure, or for other reasons? (3) The government has just begun to discuss the issue of abolishing taels and using yuan, and there are quite a few people who hold a delaying policy to resist it. The opponents say, "We agree in principle, but the method must be considered." Their argument is the same as Mr. Wu's so-called "Implementing abolishing taels and changing to yuan must wait until the people are conscious, without government urging." The intention of delaying indefinitely is overflowing. It is just like Japan's mantra, "Open door, agree in principle." But in reality, they hope to delay and implement their delaying tactics. This kind of trick is Japan's slogan to China, and we must never adopt it. We can prove the anti-evolution of the opposition theory of the money industry with facts. People in the money industry often say, "Our China has always used silver taels, which are popular in the market." As soon as this sentence is uttered, the act of anti-evolution is established. We must know that in the past, bamboo rafts were used for transportation. Why do we use airplanes now? Does the airplane intentionally suppress the function of the bamboo raft? But according to the facts, it is clear that bamboo rafts were used in the barbaric era, and the time effect has been lost. Because it is inconvenient, it is reformed, from bamboo rafts to wooden boats, to ships, to trains, to airplanes, more and more advanced, taking its convenience and simplicity. Silver taels are also the same. In the past, there were no foreign silver dollars, so silver taels were valued. Later, foreign silver dollars were imported from abroad (such as the Spanish dollar, etc.). People saw its convenience, and the government also followed the saying, so they built the dragon silver dollar. This is the origin of the silver dollar. The purpose is nothing more than its effectiveness being greater than silver taels. And it is intended to drive out silver taels with silver dollars, just like airplanes and boats are not intentionally driving out bamboo rafts. The function is like this, and human evolution is like this. Now deliberately delaying and insisting on silver taels is a manifestation of anti-evolution. This is why I talked to the students the other day, seeking to concentrate the wisdom of the youth to promote the saying of abolishing taels and changing to yuan, and realize it as soon as possible, so as not to make the civilization and happiness that has reached the evolutionary road return to the reverse. Mr. Wu Jingxiong is a famous jurist of the contemporary era, who has lectured in North America and is well-known overseas. Now he is in tune with the anti-evolutionary faction, and is willing to be an opponent of abolishing taels and changing to yuan, speaking out for them. We sincerely regret it. Moreover, Mr. Wu's remarks are all contradictory, mostly just arguing for the money houses, and not understanding the truth of economics. Now listed as follows: (1) Mr. Wu Jingxiong said, "Gentlemen in the money industry have repeatedly expressed their opinions, and have not opposed the changing to yuan. However, they see that they request to unify the right to mint coins, rectify the issuance system, recover extraterritorial rights, and restrict foreign banks from absorbing deposits and issuing banknotes. Under today's political situation, it does not seem to be a reason for杞憂目之, etc." Looking at the words quoted by Mr. Wu, it is clearly stated that at this time when internal affairs have not been cultivated and foreign affairs have not been governed, abolishing taels and changing to yuan is not yet the time. Is this statement true or not? Which is the first priority, repairing internal affairs or rectifying foreign affairs? Foreigners say that internal affairs must be repaired before extraterritorial rights can be recovered, but the Chinese opinion is the opposite. Which comes first and which comes later? Who can decide this? It is the same theory as which came to the world first, the hen or the egg. This is a mystery question, and everyone agrees that if, as Mr. Wu said, we must wait until this mystery question is resolved before abolishing taels and changing to yuan, then this kind of mystery question may not be solved in ten thousand years. Then abolishing taels and changing to yuan will be left to nature. Mr. Wu's delaying plan is a truly indefinite delay. What we all agree on is that repairing internal affairs and rectifying foreign affairs must be carried out simultaneously, and not allow them to be prioritized. As for the government's past achievements in rectifying foreign affairs, we cannot say that there is absolutely none, such as the recovery of the Mixed Court, the reorganization of the customs and postal services, the recovery of tariff autonomy, and the receipt of some concessions. We must know that achievements must be gradually made, and cannot be achieved overnight. Now abolishing taels and changing to yuan is the time to rectify foreign affairs, and at the same time, it is also a matter of repairing internal affairs. (2) Mr. Wu also said, "The depreciation of foreign cents and the melting of good coins are a good opportunity to abolish taels and change to yuan. This is really close to the idea of ​​shopkeepers speculating." Mr. Wu used this tone, which is far from understanding my original intention. Because the National Currency Regulations of the Third Year of the Republic stipulated that the weight of silver dollars was seven qian and two fen, silver nine and copper one, but the fineness of Yuan coins at that time was not the same, silver only eight nine, and copper was eleven, which was less than the pure silver fineness stipulated by law. The intention was not that the government had the idea of ​​speculating for profit, but because it wanted to use the lower fineness of Yuan coins to unify silver coins. At that time, there were many types of silver dollars on the market, in addition to Yuan coins, such as Spanish dollars, etc. Their fineness was mostly higher than that of Yuan coins. Now using the principle of inferior coins driving out good coins, so that miscellaneous silver dollars disappear, then the unification of national coins will be easier. The government's intention is very deep, and there is absolutely no idea of ​​shopkeepers speculating. People who do not understand the truth often cause misunderstandings, which is very regrettable. After the May Fourth Movement, the number of Yuan coins on the market increased day by day, enough to supply the market. At this time, foreign banks had very few Spanish dollar reserves. Therefore, Mr. Song Hanzhang, the manager of the Bank of China in Shanghai, came forward to negotiate with foreign banks, requesting that a special exchange rate for Spanish dollars be opened, using Yuan coins as the basis. The result was satisfactory, and the Spanish dollar exchange rate was immediately canceled. As a result, the government's goal was achieved more than half. Now my goal is this, to use the silver dollars cast by the Hangzhou factory with a higher fineness, and take advantage of the depreciation of foreign cents, which will inevitably be melted. Then the remaining ones are only Hangzhou dollars. Then the formal legal currency stipulated by the government in the future can take Hangzhou dollars as the standard, adding the casting fee to the pure silver fineness contained in Hangzhou dollars as a hypothesis. This will not cause many changes, and it is simple and easy to implement. Therefore, my intention is to use economic policies to achieve the purpose of abolishing taels and using yuan. The so-called excellent opportunity for silver dollar unification is here. Mr. Wu is a legal expert, and it is appropriate that he does not understand the content of economics. As for the casting fee, the international regulations seem to be six li. Some people advocate one fen and two li, and I think it is too heavy. Although our country's finances cannot follow the British practice of free minting (GratuitouiCoiuage), the casting fee should not be too heavy. Although the government will inevitably suffer a slight loss, it will be of great benefit to the people. The benefit is not shallow. The fineness stipulated in the National Currency Regulations is silver nine and copper one, but in reality silver is eight nine and copper is eleven. This must be formally passed by the Legislative Yuan to be effective. As for other procedures, those that do not involve the scope of legislation can be handled by administrative punishment. If the casting fee is heavier than six li, or lighter than six li, then of course the Legislative Yuan must pass it before it can be determined. As for the relationship between creditors and debtors in the exchange rate between silver taels and silver dollars, it is not shallow. The administrative aspect can consider and punish it. Because silver tael creditors always hope for a low exchange rate, so they can receive more silver dollars. And debtors always hope for a high exchange rate, so they can pay less silver dollars. We hope that the administrative aspect will give it a moderate treatment, so that creditors and debtors are both up and down, which is the best. Merchants in various places can also refer to this method and submit their opinions, and then the government adopts it. This is the responsibility of the administrative authorities. In case there is no result in the discussion, the new national currency can be used as the exchange standard, which is fairer. (3) Mr. Wu also said, "The steps of changing to yuan should of course be based on soft and hard coins as the premise. We must first determine the hard coins with good fineness, and then fill the concentrated preparation of soft coin issuance, and then we can talk about changing. Otherwise, the prices will not rise sharply due to the filling of inferior coins, and the social economy and the livelihood of the people will not be seriously affected by the sharp rise in prices." This statement is correct, but if we must have hard coins and sufficient unified preparation for soft coins, and then the prices will not rise sharply and the people will not be affected, this is inappropriate. Because after the hard coins are unified, the prices may still rise, and the livelihood of the people may still be affected. This is two things, and absolutely cannot be confused to scare people and confuse people's minds. There are many reasons for price inflation, not only as Mr. Wu said. The overissuance of banknotes is indeed one of the reasons, but we cannot say that there is no inflation if the preparation is sufficient. Because the following points can cause inflation: (A) The relationship of the circulation rate (Velocityof Cridation). Because the currency passage rate is rapid, its turnover rate is fast, like the increase in the amount of currency. Since it is equal to the increase in the amount of currency, the inflation of prices is an expected thing, and there is no doubt. (B) The relationship of trade reduction. If the currency does not decrease, and trade is declining day by day, then there is less need for currency. On the contrary, there is more currency. Then the prices will rise without expectation. (C) The relationship of convenient transportation. Once the transportation is convenient, the circulation rate of currency will naturally be more agile. Then, invisibly, due to the rapid circulation rate, the currency will increase again, and the prices will inflate. (D) Currency depreciation, such as silver. If silver is not worth money, then the currency made of silver will naturally be depreciated tangibly or intangibly, and all things will rise in price. (E) The relationship of deposit checks. In the future, the use of checks will be great, like the increase in currency, and prices will naturally rise. Mr. Wu is so worried about banknotes. What will happen when checks are circulated in the future? This is really杞人憂天墜地. Mr. Wu's remarks are indeed correct on the level of banknotes, but we cannot say that we must wait until the prices do not inflate before we can abolish taels and use yuan. Because we want to make the prices not inflate, it is absolutely impossible. As mentioned above, if it is as Mr. Wu said, then when will abolishing taels and using yuan be realized? I don't know, I'm afraid the realization date is so far away that I can't even dream of it. Moreover, even if the banknote issuance system is unified and the preparation is sufficient, it is difficult to guarantee that there will be no abuses in overissuance. Because the amount of banknote issuance, the sufficiency of the preparation, and the issuance system are absolutely two things, and should not be confused. For example, in Germany before the war, the laws restricting banks were very strict. The system was very complete, and the preparation was very sufficient. Why did it come to this after the war, with one billion of paper marks to exchange for one gold mark? Is it not a strange thing? The sudden change of the world is so. Before the war, the German bank had considerable regulations for the issuance of banknotes. One-third of all circulating amounts must be prepared with cash, and the remaining two-thirds must be based on discounted notes within three months, and must be signed by three people, at least two, but must be creditworthy. Therefore, the issuance in Germany is divided into two parts, one is the cash preparation amount, and the other is the guarantee preparation amount. The so-called guarantee preparation amount, the number must be stipulated by the legislative body, and can be requested to increase at any time when necessary. If the guaranteed preparation issuance amount of the German bank exceeds the legal number, then a tax of 5% must be levied on the exceeded number. This method is nothing more than to meet the supply and demand in the market. If the chip is not lacking, and gradually sees abundance, then the bank will automatically return the overissued amount, because it feels that the heavy tax is not cost-effective. This is called the elastic currency system (elartic cureneg). The system can be regarded as the first in the world. As a result, because of the war, paper money tended to be overissued, which was helpless. Therefore, the matter of abolishing taels and using yuan should absolutely not be involved in the banknote problem. Once involved, abolishing taels and using yuan will not be realized. As for the banking system and banknote issuance regulations, the United Kingdom is even more reliable. One pound of cash抵一磅鈔票, in the past it was still stipulated that under one four million, it was not necessary to be so strict (the number of one four million has gradually increased to this day). But during the European War, issuance treasury notes (treasuynotes) to help, as a result, the banknotes were harmed, and the monetary system was destroyed. From every gold pound combined with美金元四·八六六, fell to元三·二左右, the people suffered abnormally. This is also a great example of ineffective sufficient preparation. The banknote issuance system of the Bank of Japan is also world-renowned, but since the gold ban, Japanese banknotes have been suspended for redemption, and the price has fallen. As a result, it is no different from overissuance. This is why we cannot say that the system is good, and there is no abuse of overissuance. It can be clearly understood. What does Mr. Wu think of it? (4) All countries have standard currencies, but China does not. Chinese silver taels have the qualifications of a standard currency, but because the silver taels are uneven in surface, miscellaneous in color, and divided on the spot, they cannot be circulated throughout the country, and there is no legal basis. In other words, the silver dollars that can be unified throughout the country have a legal basis, but do not have the qualifications of a standard currency. Therefore, only China has this kind of malformed system. Strictly speaking, it can be said that China still does not have the existence of a standard currency. In terms of countries in the world, only this is the case. In this situation, dare to ask Mr. Wu, has the time come? Can our people not rush to catch up? If it has not arrived, then when will we have to wait? Do we have to wait until after the country is destroyed before we see the arrival of the time? After the country is destroyed, Mr. Wu does not need to say that the time has arrived, and even foreigners will not allow this silver tael to exist, and will implement their country's monetary system. The strange situation of our country's currency, the malformed system of silver taels and silver dollars, is like the main wife and concubine of a family, with unclear authority. The silver dollar is like the main wife, stipulated by law, but because of its weakness and lack of authority, it shrinks back. All family affairs are in the hands of the concubine, silver taels. But the concubine is not allowed by law, so there is no position of dignity for the main wife, and there are many concubines in a family, just like there are many silver taels in a country, so none of the concubines can govern the whole family, just like none of the silver taels can be circulated throughout the country. But the concubine has authority, just like the silver tael has the qualifications of a standard currency. As for the main wife, she is recognized by law, just like the silver dollar has the legal qualifications. In a country, every family has a main wife, just like in a country, every family has silver dollars. That is, silver dollars can be circulated throughout the country, and all families have main wives, so the main wife is justifiable. The concubine is not necessarily a concubine for everyone. It can be seen that the status of the concubine is far inferior to that of the main wife. It is a pity that the main wife has no authority. But in a family, the wife and concubine stand side by side, and there are many disputes. Mr. Wu is a famous lawyer on the sea, dare to ask for advice, abolish the wife and establish the concubine? Or abolish the concubine and respect the wife? Mr. Wu also said, "At present, the banknotes of each bank are also limited to the region and cannot be circulated throughout the country. For example, the banknotes of Shanghai cannot be carried to Hankou for redemption, and the banknotes of Tianjin cannot be carried to Guangzhou for use. The territory is divided, like Qin and Yue, and the obstacle to unifying the currency system is not输銀兩. It is very obvious that the issuance system should be rectified first. If we do not take this as our duty, but start to abolish taels and change to yuan first, can we sweep away the above obstacles?" etc. Looking at this, I know that Mr. Wu has not yet understood the true meaning of abolishing taels and changing to yuan. It is clear that he has no considerable understanding. I sincerely hope that Mr. Wu will do further research, so as not to fail your enthusiastic expectation. The biggest mistake of Mr. Wu in this section lies in the inversion of cause and effect. What Mr. Wu thought was the cause is the result that we know well. What Mr. Wu thought was the result is the cause that we have always known. Because the silver taels have not been abolished, the Shanghai banknotes cannot be cashed in Hankou. Who bears the loss? I will give an example below to clarify the matter: Example: How will it turn out to汇大洋一千元 to Hankou? Solution: Silver dollars have no exchange rate and cannot be exchanged with each other, so they must convert the silver dollars into silver taels. Today's exchange rate is assumed to be: (A) The Shanghai silver cent is six qian and eight fen. (B) 一○○○ 兩申規元二九七○兩漢洋例. (C) The Hankou silver cent is six qian three fen and three li. (Algorithm): Silver dollars 一○○○元二一○○○Ｘ○六八兩二六八○兩 (甲規元) 申規元六八○兩汇至漢口合洋例銀 (一○○○；九七○二六八○；) 二六五九、六兩 (漢洋例), the Hankou silver cent is ○、六六三兩, should take silver dollars as 六五九、六○、六六三二元九九五. Conclusion: Due to the calculation of silver dollars and silver taels going in and out, I lost the five silver dollars. We know that from汇大洋千元 to Hankou, Hankou only had九九五元. Who is responsible for it? Who ordered it? Said銀兩之作俑也. Shanghai banknotes could not be cashed in Hankou, so who bears the five silver dollars of loss the Shanghai bank or the Hankou bank. If Shanghai Hankou banknotes can be cashed in each other, then businessmen are happy to carry cash to and from Shanghai Hankou, and thousands of元 is still 千元. You can save the remittance fee, but because銀兩 is still there, the Shanghai and Hankou banknotes can not be mutually redeemed for fear of losing five元. Therefore, if銀兩 is not abolished for a day, it's what Mr. Wu said. Shanghai banknotes cannot be cashed in Hankou and Tianjin banknotes cannot be used in Guangzhou. Mr. Wu's remarks are unavoidable to attack with his own spears. I dare say that after the abolition of兩爲元, the difference in exchange rates will not be so great. Therefore, for the sake of the masses, the abolition of兩用元 should not be delayed. In the past, Tianjin merchants or coin shops would exclusively use某 bank notes in Beijing to go back and forth between Beijing and Tianjin, depending on the level of洋厘 in the two places. If洋厘 in Beijing is high, they transport them to Beijing. Once天津洋厘 is transferred to 高, they transport them to Tianjin. In and out of one, the profit is high, as a result, the bank was exploited by them. This is speculative thought. Therefore, advocating to delay by reason to maintain silver兩者 is really similar to the speculation thought of merchants. The facts are clear, and it is not false. (Six) Mr. Wu also said (Six reasons for the 洋厘暴落 all受政治方面影響, If politics is on the right track and finances are handled well, the above six causes can be eliminated, etc., which is also different from the economic trend, the decline of the rural economy, the concentration of urban funds, and the decline of urban industry and commerce are related to politics, but it can also be irrelevant to politics. This is an economic problem. Mr. Wu's words have no logical meaning. The politics of the United States cannot be said to be not on the right track. Why has the rural economy declined and wheat is not sold, and the funds in London and New York are concentrated, and there is no shadow phenomenon, which can be seen everywhere. We cannot say that the politics of Britain and the United States are not on the right track. Therefore, Mr. Wu's words do not contain logic. I want to talk to Mr. Wu about what I have said in detail. Mr. Wu is a famous lawyer on the sea. I know that he is rich in learning and innovative in thought. He has also lectured overseas and his name is播中外. He is a very promising youth, and his future is very great. But we must pay 12 minutes of attention to the abolition of兩用元 and should think for the masses, and should not stand for a few people, it is a great fortune.</p>
<p>Now my humble opinion on the government authorities, I will use what I see, if the government does anything that benefits the majority of the people, then of course it should be done decisively and without hesitation. A few people are harmed or a few people particularly occupy惠, not what we should care about or cover up. What we should pay attention to is the interests of the majority of the people as a premise. Now, I will briefly describe the policies of European countries to regulate the currency system, so that the government authorities can refer to them. Check the currency system of various European countries, there are three countermeasures (　) 消滅法 (Inflation)｜｜ie more issued currency, so that the amount of currency澎</p>
<p>漲, and then make it not worth money, and the result is zero value, and everything goes to extinction, this law is used by Germany, Austria and Russia, and this strategy has mixed advantages and disadvantages. (A) 利 (A) National debt can be written off in one stroke, and the treasury bills and banknotes issued will not be accounted for. (B) If Germany issues a new 金馬克, the national economy can be gradually restored in a short time, the purpose is to restore the original state before the war, so that Germany can gradually work hard and reach the best. (乙) 害｜｜Private savings disappear overnight, no matter those with thousands or tens of thousands of盈者, are declared to be poor people. As a result, private bankruptcy, industrial and commercial stagnation, and worker unemployment, all kinds of problems follow one after another, and the government should weigh the advantages and disadvantages and determine the policy 可也. Germany absolutely adopted this strategy, and was burdened by the burden of indemnities, and had to restore the pre-war economic state, and to achieve this goal, it had to write off the banknotes in one stroke, and then it could issue a new 金馬克 to stabilize the domestic market, so once the goal is determined, it is implemented immediately, and there is no delay. This strategy is as審相等, and Germany also has other purposes, so it is resolutely adopted. Comparing Germany to华, our country's abolition of taels and 除元 has more advantages than disadvantages, so it should be implemented immediately without asking for索. (Ⅱ) 提高法 (deflation)｜｜This method uses a contraction policy to gradually increase the value of the currency. Britain and Italy use this method, which also has advantages and disadvantages. (丙) 利, (A) Once the banknotes are contracted and the value of the currency is increased, the people will enjoy a cheap and beautiful life. (B) The creditor is benefited. In the past, he loaned money with a lower value to others, and now he must return the currency with a higher value, such as holding banknotes, contracts and treasury bills, which can be exchanged for cash, which is a great profit. (B) 害, (A) Once the currency value is expensive, there will be less exports and more imports. Foreign goods will compete to enter the country for profit, and the exports of domestic goods will be less, because the cost is greater, and it seems too uneconomical to exchange foreign low-value currencies. (B) The debtor has suffered a lot. In the past, he borrowed money with a lower value, and now he must repay it with more expensive money. One in and one out, the loss is not贊, and as a result, shops close down, workers are unemployed, causing strikes and unrest. (C) The burden of people paying taxes is significantly greater, because prices fall,銀錢收入 is less, and the tax rate is still paid as usual. (D) The burden of promissory notes and debt notes issued by the company is also increased, so the company saves expenses, reduces salaries, and seeks to remedy, which will lead to restlessness. This strategy has equal advantages and disadvantages, but the British government still adopts this strategy to increase the value of the currency, because there is a purpose. If there is a policy, the direction it takes is based on this policy, and the reason why Britain takes this is nothing more than to maintain its own position. In the world's business center countries, after the war, the banknotes were not worth money, and the credit was about to fall, which had a great impact on Britain itself, so Britain decided to adopt this strategy, in order to maintain it. After implementation, the value of the gold pound gradually increased from three or two元 to four or six yuan. Restore the pre-war original state (when it fell from four·八六元 to three·二元, it was 7070). The 里拉 of Italy was worth美金○·二元, and after the war, it fell to○·○四元, which is 1/2 of the original value, so Italy also adopted a lifting policy, but the result was far inferior to Britain, only raised to○·○五二六元. Britain and Italy have goals, so they resolutely adopt this strategy. Our country's abolition of taels and yuan is inherently more advantageous than harmful. We should implement it resolutely,</p>
<p>(Three) Stability, France (devaluation), The original price is still high, such as falling to a certain number, that number is the fixed example. Such as the original five毛, now fall to three毛, then take three毛 as fixed, neither消滅 nor提高, absolutely maintain the original state when sorting. This method is used by countries such as France. The French currency佛郎, the original二五佛郎二二生丁, 合英金一磅, and when it was sorted out, it was以一二五佛郎合英金一镑, and the exchange rate was determined with this. The ratio of 1 to 125. Belgium also adopted this, and there are also policies. Because France does not need to pay赔欵 like Germany, nor does it have to imitate Britain's strong struggle for face, so once the policy is decided, it is resolutely adopted. I hope that the officials in charge of the abolition of兩用元 will implement it immediately once the policy is decided, and should seek the interests of the majority of the people, and should never take into account the disputes of a few, and sit down to let the good opportunity be lost.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Battle Sound Film to be Shown in Paris</h3>
<p>The violent Japanese army invaded Shanghai, and our loyal and brave 19th Route Army resisted with bloodshed. For over forty days, despite being threatened by fierce artillery fire, they did not retreat a single step. Their loyalty and bravery shocked the entire nation. At that time, various American film companies competed to send specialists to capture real-time footage of the battlefield. However, due to the intense artillery fire, they were ultimately unsuccessful. Some managed to capture images of the rear defense and the aftermath of the disaster areas. None were as detailed as the (Shanghai Battle) produced by the Star Film Company. This film was entirely shot on the actual battlefield and captured amidst the fiercest artillery fire. It was authorized by Cai Tingkai and secretly filmed in the trenches, capturing the defeated and chaotic state of the violent Japanese army. All the anti-Japanese generals, including Chen Mingshu, Jiang Guangnai, Cai Tingkai, Dai Ji, Weng Zhaoyuan, Tan Qixiu, and various division and brigade commanders, as well as the commander of the Fifth Army, personally appeared on screen. Furthermore, there were passionate speeches by Cai Tingkai, Weng Zhaoyuan, and others. When the Star Film Company produced this film, they not only braved immense danger, but the other production work of the entire company was suspended for as long as three weeks. This demonstrates the great sacrifice, far exceeding ordinary war newsreels. It is reported that this film will soon be publicly shown at an open-air cinema in Paris. At that time, our patriotic compatriots should all go to watch it, to commemorate the loyal and brave soldiers of our 19th Route Army.</p>
<h3>Woman Accuses Man of Fraudulent Engagement, Seduction, and Deceptive Acquisition of Wealth</h3>
<p>Li Lieying Accuses Sheng Xigeng</p>
<p>The woman, Li Lieying, is 24 years old and from Ningbo. She recently retained lawyer Liu Mingdu to file a lawsuit with the First Special Court, accusing Sheng Xigeng, a Ningbo native and owner of Ruichang Sheng Money Exchange on Tianjin Road, of fraudulently entering into an engagement, seducing her, and deceiving her out of her wealth. She also requested that the court order them to marry or return her jewelry. The main points of her complaint are as follows: The plaintiff lost her parents at a young age and was raised by her maternal uncle, Chen Yansheng. The gold and jewelry left by her parents were worth over a thousand yuan. The defendant conspired with Zhao Guimu to entice her to go out to meet him, claiming that the defendant was the owner of a money exchange and could be a matchmaker. Later, her maternal uncle forbade her from going out. On the sixth day of the fourth lunar month last year, Zhao Guimu and her daughter, Xiaomei, accompanied the plaintiff, claiming they were going to the City God Temple. She was tricked into going to the Huishan Hotel, where the defendant had already booked a room and was waiting. As soon as she saw his face, she immediately withdrew. The defendant then said, "I am the 'old hand' of Ruichang Money Exchange, not a poor man. Now, I am willing to write an engagement agreement with you and set a date for our wedding in October of the second half of the year, without fail." So, they signed an engagement agreement and dispersed. However, the matter was not kept secret, and her maternal uncle, Chen Yansheng, found out and questioned her severely. She had no choice but to show him the engagement agreement, but her maternal uncle's anger did not subside. The defendant then had Zhao Guimu tell her, "It is already the end of May, and we will be getting married soon. Why not move out and stay temporarily?" She was then tricked into going to the upstairs of No. 36 Ninganfang on North Zhejiang Road, which the defendant had rented. She was then forced to live with him. He also said, "Sooner or later, we will be husband and wife. We have already signed an agreement." She mistakenly believed it to be true and submitted to his lewd advances. She was also tricked out of a pair of pearl hairpins and six taels, seven mace, and five fen of gold jewelry. At the time, the defendant deceptively claimed that the gold items were dangerous to keep at home and told her to exchange them and deposit the money in the exchange to earn interest. In total, the pearl hairpins were worth 300 yuan, and the gold jewelry was worth 670 yuan, making a total of 1,000 yuan, which was deposited in Ruichang Exchange. When the Northeast Incident occurred in September, the defendant told her that the exchange had closed down and that the wedding would be postponed. On January 28th, the Shanghai Battle broke out, and they moved to avoid the fighting. At that time, the defendant not only did not provide any assistance but also had another lover, which she discovered. During the Dragon Boat Festival, the defendant took his lover to the Fanhwangdu Garden. She waited and caught them. The defendant accused her of being a mistress, which led to a quarrel. On the eleventh day, she went to Ruichang to look for him, but the defendant made excuses to avoid her and even gathered thugs to harass her family and demand to see the engagement agreement. Therefore, she had no choice but to entrust a lawyer to file a lawsuit, demanding that he be punished according to the law and ordered to fulfill the engagement agreement and return her jewelry. The day before yesterday afternoon, Judge Chuan Lin of the Fifth Criminal Court held a hearing. The plaintiff, Li Lieying, appeared in court and recounted the previous events. Judge Chuan adjourned the case for another hearing.</p>
<h3>Kunshan County Transfers Arrested Bandits</h3>
<p>In May of this year, the homes of Zhou Zhicheng and Wang Hanchen, two farmers in Pingzhuangtian Township, Bacheng, Kunshan, were robbed by a large gang of bandits, and the victims, Zhou Zhicheng and two others, were kidnapped. The bandits repeatedly sent letters demanding a large ransom. The family members of the victims reported the case to the Kunshan County Public Security Bureau, which sent detectives to Shanghai to investigate. The detectives learned of the bandits' hiding place and immediately reported it to the Water Patrol Branch of the Zhabei City Public Security Bureau. Officer Kong dispatched additional detectives, fully armed, to join them in searching three bandit ships in a river near a certain university in Jiangwan.</p>
<p>Zhou Xiaomazi, Wu Xiaoxizi, You Juxiao, and other men and women, eight people in total, were arrested, and fifty rounds of rifle ammunition were seized. They were immediately taken to the Water Patrol Team and sent to the City Public Security Bureau for interrogation and detention. The day before yesterday, Qin, the director of the Kunshan County Public Security Bureau, sent a formal letter and dispatched Officer Chen and more than ten policemen to Shanghai to the City Public Security Bureau to request the transfer of the arrested bandits. Director Wen approved the transfer of the eight bandits, including Zhou Xiaomazi, along with the firearms and ammunition to Officer Chen and sent police to escort them to the South Railway Station to board the Shanghai-Nanjing train at 3:00 p.m. that afternoon and bring them back to Kunshan for interrogation and trial.</p>

<h3>Thunderbolt Pill Cures Epidemic with Miraculous Effect</h3>
<p>A maid in a certain family on Chengdu Road suddenly contracted an epidemic the day before yesterday afternoon, with incessant vomiting and diarrhea, and excruciating abdominal pain. She took ten drops of Ten Drops Water, but it had no effect. Later, she obtained a dose of Thunderbolt Pill from the Renshen Jishe Society at No. 207 Mengdelan Road. After swallowing four pills, the vomiting stopped in less than ten minutes, and the diarrhea stopped in half an hour.</p>
<p>By evening, she had fully recovered. Those suffering from epidemics can obtain this pill from the society.</p>
<h3>A Powerful Tool for Eliminating Mosquitoes on Summer Nights</h3>
<p>Please Use (Mosquitoes Cry) Mosquito Repellent Soap</p>
<p>During summer nights, mosquitoes swarm and spread everywhere. The only method of defense is to slightly burn mosquito incense. However, mosquito incense dissipates with the air and is ineffective. Mosquitoes leave and then return, with no fundamental method of defense. Now, the German Qi Mi Deng Pharmaceutical Factory has newly invented (Mosquitoes Cry) Mosquito Repellent Soap, which can make mosquitoes retreat three times, never invading again. Even in the midst of swarms of mosquitoes, they have no ability to resist. Therefore, (Mosquitoes Cry) Soap can be called the only strong enemy of mosquitoes. Since it was sold by the Yong'an Company's Western Medicine Department, it has become popular for a time and sold out. A second batch of new goods has arrived from Germany and sales have begun. It is said that buying one bar of soap can be used for the entire summer. Buyers generally believe it is economical and effective.</p>

<h3>Bank of China Inspection Report</h3>
<p>53rd Time</p>
<p>The 53rd Inspection Report of the Shanghai Bank of China Issuance Reserve Inspection Committee states: The members of this committee, along with commissioned accountants, inspected the Shanghai Bank of China's head office issuance and associated banks' withdrawal of convertible note reserve vault on July 31, 1932, in accordance with the committee's rules. The Director of the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance also joined the inspection. The results of the inspection are listed on the left. The total amount of convertible notes issued is 97,412,728 yuan, including 52,667,940 yuan issued by the head office, 18,182,964 yuan withdrawn by associated banks, and 26,561,824 yuan withdrawn by various banks and shops. Except for the portion withdrawn by various banks and shops, which is inspected separately according to the original method, this inspection covers the portion of associated banks as follows: The amount issued by the head office and withdrawn by associated banks is 70,850,904 yuan.

<h3>Textual Research on Cooked Rice</h3>
<p>— Zhanlu</p>
<p>Steaming hot rice, sold in wooden buckets to people as a snack... It doesn't cost much, but it can fill one's stomach. It is indeed a grain platform in civil society. This profession is called selling "chi" rice.</p>
<p>The "chi" character in "chi" rice is certainly not this character. It must be a mispronunciation. Some people correct the name, saying it is "zhu" rice, or "xi" rice... I say... none of them are correct. The original name of "chi" rice is just "chui" rice.</p>
<p>People in the Suzhou and Shanghai area generally call the "chui" character of "wind blowing" the "ningchi" character... The "chui" character of "chui" rice has the same sound as the "chui" character. Therefore, "chui" rice is called "chi" rice. This is an unchangeable principle. If you say, it is clearly steamed rice, why not call it steamed rice but call it "chui" rice? Solving this problem is related to the history of the Northern Song Dynasty... Let me cite two notes from Song people for textual research... 1. Qingxiang Miscellaneous Records says...｜Emperor Renzong's temple name was "Zheng," which sounds similar to "zheng." The inner court上下不敢呼蒸字,呼蒸饼爲炊饼 (inner court上下不敢呼蒸字,呼蒸饼爲炊饼 means the inner court did not dare to call the character 'zheng' and called steamed bread 'chui' bread.)</p>
<p>2. Yichuan's Sayings say... ｜During the Renzong period, the palace ladies called the first month "Shi Yue," and steamed bread "Chui Bing." In order to avoid the Song taboo, steamed bread was called "chui" bread. ｜ The "chui" bread sold by Wu Dalang was also steamed bread, not baked sesame cake. The common saying is that Wu Dalang sold sesame cakes, but this is a longstanding error. Water Margin only says he sold "chui" bread. ｜ Then, of course, calling steamed rice "chui" rice is also a habit passed down from the Northern Song Dynasty.</p>
<p>We can know that... Before Emperor Renzong of Song, people who sold steamed rice only called it selling steamed rice... In order to avoid the Song taboo, they called it selling "chui" rice. In order to undergo the changes of the Suzhou and Shanghai dialects, they called it selling "chi" rice. Alas... the things in this rice bucket have also changed their names three times!</p>
<h3>Idle Talk Under the Bean Arbor</h3>
<p>— Xu Benxi</p>
<p>｜Supplementary Anecdotes of the Shanghai Battle｜</p>
<p>The setting sun goes home, the gentle breeze caresses, the farmers carry a hoe on their shoulders, all reciting ("Return!") At this time, if we are interested, then, under the bean arbor, it is good to sit on the ground, afraid of nothing... talking about everything... Of course, ｜the farmers have always regarded this (battle) as the center of conversation.</p>
<p>Country people's thinking is simple, and their speech is also straightforward. They do not understand that speaking has art and skill. When mentioning a certain important person, they unceremoniously scold him (turtle). Similarly, when mentioning the 19th Route Army, a day's hard work and fatigue will disappear like smoke. Of course, they automatically dug trenches for the army, which once had a harmonious spirit of military-civilian unity. However, from this, what can we conclude about how the government is not good at using the national spirit and giving us up? The anecdotes of the Shanghai Battle have been fully collected by writers. However, I feel that there is still little experience from the standpoint of the rural farmers, so I am making a supplement.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the general retreat of the 19th Route Army is worth crying over, but no one has ever thought that some soldiers never retreated. This is a fact. In the lost land west of Zhabei, our military spies never left the enemy army a step. They only changed their clothes. At that time, in the farmer team working in the fields, eight out of ten were soldiers. They had guns, bullets, and hand grenades... Hidden so that no one could find them. They stood on the same line as the real farmers, waiting for the opportunity to come, to make an internal explosion. But later, Shanghai champagne was raised high, the Second World War did not break out, and the ingenious plan of the 19th Army did not shake the world. Japan, which boasted of being deeply versed in military science, was only a paper tiger.</p>
<p>The Eastern soldiers were extremely afraid of death. After invading, for food and water, they must first call the Chinese to drink before daring to drink. At the same time,</p>

<h3>Why Can't an Egg Be Broken by Pinching It Straight?</h3>
<p>— Gao Qian</p>
<p>An egg cannot be broken by pinching it straight is not absolute. However, to break it straight, you must have great strength.</p>
<p>The reason why it is difficult to break is due to the very special form of the eggshell. We can regard the eggshell as being made of many small arches. In general, the narrower and higher the arch, the stronger its resistance. The wider and lower the arch, the weaker its resistance.</p>
<p>Let's look at the egg now. When we pinch it from both sides, its shape is two very wide and low arches put together. Therefore, the resistance is the weakest. When we pinch it from both ends, its shape is two very narrow and high arches. Putting them together, the resistance is extremely strong.</p>
<p>This is the reason why it is difficult to break an egg by pinching it straight.</p>
<p>They give food to the villagers to eat, even if it is rotten, they can only swallow it immediately, otherwise, hum! The bayonet is shining!</p>
<p>It was much more bitter in the lost land than when fighting. Seeing the Eastern soldiers, one cannot laugh, two cannot not laugh, three cannot walk fast, nor can they walk slowly. In short, it is best not to walk. The A-San guarding the watchtower was slapped four times in a row. The villagers, who are now terrified at the mere mention of tigers, do not know that people in the lost land can no longer compare themselves to others. They think this is because they offended the Eastern soldiers.</p>
<h3>At the Bund Park</h3>
<p>— Qiu Lang</p>
<p>If it weren't for this scorching sun and rain-like sweat, who would appreciate the precious good nights with comfortable breezes and a delightful moon!</p>
<p>I am no exception. After finishing work, having dinner, I went with a few colleagues to the Bund Park, aiming to cool off. However, I couldn't help but feel a sense of the beautiful summer nights of my hometown - West Lake! Now, all I have is reminiscence and melancholy!</p>
<p>Many people consider the Bund Park a "meat market," but I dare not make such a rash judgment. However, there are indeed quite a few strangely dressed men and women! Are these the modern men and modern women? I am ashamed that I cannot determine for sure.</p>
<p>Because of the crowd, we felt the lack of seats. Those who arrived early had priority. But our legs were already demanding a five-minute rest. So, we eagerly searched and finally discovered a "new continent" - the lawn! We saw old, young, male, and female, all imitating the ancient custom of sitting on the ground, as if holding a grand meeting. We happily joined in. I silently observed the actions of the people around me: talking, singing, playing finger-guessing games, joking, eating, reading. And each person's posture was different: leaning, squatting, sitting upright, lying down. This truly fulfilled the saying "sleeping in the embrace of nature." Moreover, there were those couples, sitting shoulder to shoulder, closely touching, whispering sweet nothings. One moment his mouth was close to her ear, and she lowered her head almost touching her chest, without any reaction. Such a sensual and mysterious scene, if not love, what is it? Ah! How could one not feel envy and jealousy?</p>
<p>The wheel of time keeps moving forward. The Customs House clock struck twelve times, and we finally started walking back.</p>
<h3>Notes on Reading Paintings at Honglu</h3>
<p>— Xu Shiqi</p>
<p>Among contemporary artists who practice traditional Chinese painting, some blindly imitate the ancients, merely copying forms, while others scribble randomly, lacking any rules. It is indeed rare to find someone who can experience nature, fully understand the essence of things, and use brush and ink to express their unique ideas and unleash their spirit. This is why traditional Chinese painting is gradually declining and unable to recover. On a day off, I visited Mr. Bei Hong at his residence and had the opportunity to view his recent works. His unrestrained and spirited strokes are reviving the decline of modern Chinese painting and correcting the trend of decadence. I was amazed!</p>
<p>The painting "Heron by the Lake" uses simple and powerful brushwork and elegant colors, creating a unique style. "Unable to Bear Looking Back" conveys feelings of sorrow and tragedy through the form of a creature, which is deeply profound. The horizontal scroll "Galloping Horse" is rich in ink and comes alive on the paper. The inscribed verse says, "Where to entrust oneself on this journey to the ends of the earth? Even a spirited competition is futile in sadness." It expresses boundless melancholy. The most exquisite depictions of roosters include "Looking Back Sideways for Its Flock" and "A Rooster's Crow Whitens the World." With sensitivity to the times and sorrow for things, his brush and ink flow freely, like a talented and outstanding individual standing apart from the crowd. Especially during the national crisis, there are many outstanding works. As the saying goes, "The more impoverished, the more refined." The painting "Lazy Cat" vividly depicts the Chinese people indulging in a life of pleasure, muddled and stubborn, with great accuracy and subtlety. I recall the inscribed verse saying, "Good to lower the head towards the sun, feeling ashamed when curled up." The annotation says, "Chinese people like to exaggerate, and have perished frequently. Yet they still call themselves the 'Awakened Lion,' but are in fact just lazy cats. The 20th century is reaching its peak, seemingly wanting to surpass the people of Malaysia. But their fate is not so. I carefully depict their state, hoping that one day I will not have to see it." With just a few strokes, he captures the emotions of excitement, depression, and grief. It is truly a masterpiece that people are eager to treasure. Overall, Bei Hong's works are graceful and magnificent, grand and unrestrained, like thousands of streams competing to flow, vast for thousands of miles, like a yellow bell and great chime, resounding through the clouds, leaving viewers with a lasting and profound impression.</p>
<h3>Images on the Yangtze River</h3>
<p>— Shazhou</p>
<p>(3) Beggars in Wuhu</p>
<p>The setting sun painted golden lines on the deep blue waves of the Yangtze River. Our ship was docked at the shore of Wuhu. Beautiful buildings stood tall atop handsome cliffs, and elegant hills gently sloped down. Everything was immersed in the mellow, golden light of the evening sun. As usual, passengers were getting on and off the ship at the pier.</p>
<p>Beneath the ship on the left side, a group of hungry beggars huddled together, shouting. Among them were elderly people and women with infants. They used small boats and large wooden basins as tools to reach the ship from the shore. With cries and wails, they begged from the passengers on the ship. Hungry eyes stared at the guests in the first-class cabin. "May you, esteemed guests, cultivate blessings, longevity, and descendants!" Then, compassionate women scattered a few copper coins. "Miss, Madam, give me money to buy rice!" Then, fashionable modern girls who liked to show off threw down a cigarette butt. Subsequently, those who were deeply moved by the tragic cries, as well as those who sympathized with them, gave some money. An old man's wooden basin was small, and all the money given to him fell into the water. A bitter smile on his face showed his inner frustration. A wealthy lady gave him five copper coins, but two fell into the water, and three jumped from his head into someone else's small boat.</p>
<p>When the ship departed, the beggars also left. When a girl sitting in a wooden basin lifted her headscarf, we saw that two gardenias were pinned in her black hair. At this moment, the wealthy ladies and misses all went into the cabins, pouting their lips high.</p>
<p>(4) Night on the River</p>
<p>At night, the river breeze was particularly cool, making people feel lazy. Wuhu was long left behind, leaving only a few flickering lights on the horizon, almost like the faint stars with ghostly eyes in the sky. Without noticing, the round moon quietly peeked out from the cloud curtain, with a light yellow blush floating on its white face, as if lacking the courage to raise its head.</p>
<p>Soon, the moon rose much higher. People sitting by the ship's railing were all silently bathed in moonlight, seemingly enjoying the gift of the silver light to the fullest. But those young vagrants! Were all shedding tears by the railing.</p>
<p>The mountain ranges on both banks stretched endlessly like long belts, with undulating curves, clearly etched against the dim sky. Oh, on the vast waves of the Yangtze River, ten thousand silver sails were surging forward! The waves were splashing, the giant waves were roaring, carrying the melancholy mood of the sick East. Oh, great Yangtze River, I will sing wildly for you! Oh, the infinite greatness of the universe!</p>
<h3>Striking the Bell at the Old Temple (61)</h3>
<p>— Bu Chu Ting Cao Zhai Fu</p>
<p>Sixty People</p>
<p>The old temple school has been running vigorously for more than a month, but there isn't even a sign in front of the gate. It not only lacks a school sign but also hasn't decided on a school name. Some people call it the Old Temple School, some call it the Old Temple Academy, some call it the Old Temple Elementary School, and some simply, without thinking, call it the Old Temple. It's like a lovely child without a name, whom monks and nuns call whatever they please. I thought to myself that since the old temple is a school, it should have a sign. With a sign, the school name will naturally be unified. I finally asked Mr. Zhu to write the school sign so that I could take it to be carved and painted.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu said, "This is a difficult problem. I have also thought about writing a school sign, but so far I haven't come up with a good name, how can I write it? To be honest, the old temple is not an ordinary so-called school. If it were just a school, then I could just pick up a pen and write it, what difficulty would there be? Unfortunately, what we are running here, although it is a small school, is also a small workshop and a small society. The main meaning of the school is progress, the main meaning of the workshop is production, and the main meaning of the society is equality, mutual assistance, and self-defense. Workshop is not quite the same as factory; it includes all open-air production work such as planting, mining, road construction, and bridge building. So, this group of ours contains these three meanings. You can simply call it the Triune Principle. You must also know that these three meanings permeate the entire life of our group. It is fundamentally different from the ordinary so-called work-study school. The work-study school is half a day of work and half a day of study, work is work, and study is study, not connected. Our little experiment is to integrate the workshop, school, and society into one. If I were to write it as a school, I would inevitably lose the meaning of production and society. I don't want to call it a school. How about the names Old Temple Work-Study Society and Old Temple Work-Study Group?"</p>
<p>I said, "Old Temple Work-Study Group is more to my liking. The word 'group' contains the meaning of unity or collective. The word 'society' is broader. The biggest problem with Chinese society is that it is a plate of loose sand. Only the life of a group can correct this problem and bring out the strength of the masses."</p>
<p>Although Mr. Zhu agreed with my choice, he was still unwilling to write the sign immediately. I saw that there was still an unresolved issue in his mind. He said, "Let's think carefully and write it in a few days. It's not too late."</p>

<p>Gold Market Over the Past Week</p>
<p>No Significant Fluctuations</p>
<p>Slight Decline of One or Two Mace and Six Cash</p>
<p>The gold market last week showed a trend of hovering, but there were no excessive storms. Each day only fluctuated by three or four taels, at most six taels or more. In retrospect, it often remained around 750 taels. It seemed that both the bulls and bears were in control, so the demand and supply differed. Tracing back to the beginning of the week, the opening price slightly fell by four cash, to 747 taels and a half, because the silver market rebounded. The next day, it suddenly plummeted to 41 taels and 2 cash (the new low price since the September launch). Later, because the British and American exchange rates suddenly tended to fall, but the large bars of silver were shrinking daily, the market price rose and fell erratically. By Thursday, both domestic and foreign exchange markets were tense, and the shorts urgently covered, so the trend turned bullish, once rising to 53 taels and 4 cash. Unfortunately, the Guangdong Bang Yifeng and Jewish merchants released, and the price softened heavily that day, returning to 50 taels. Afterwards, the situation became complicated again, and people's hearts were uneasy. The weekend turned from stable to weak due to the deteriorating situation in Northeast Rehe. Because the British silver report was rising, and the local bills followed suit, the selling pressure from large households surged, but hedgers took in. As a result, only (the opening and closing price differed by 1 tael and 2 cash). According to the weekly high and low, it was 12 taels and 2 cash. As for the overseas silver market, British silver slightly rebounded by 0.25, while American silver was even. The Shanghai market British gold hung on the long end by 0.5 (0.375), while American gold only rose by 0.125. However, internally, the trends differed. British gold rose by 0.25, while American gold was even, which was due to the exchange rate falling miserably again. Gold firms mostly sold, and there were fewer forward settlements, mostly hedging transactions. The British to American exchange rate had plunged by 4.75, and the American to British exchange rate had also fallen by 4.625. The gold price calculated by the American exchange rate was still pressed down by about 70 taels. The total number of exchange contracts as of Friday was about 23,800. It was also found that the Dalian Bang accounted for about 2,000 contracts, Yuan Xing Yong even reached over 8,000 (mostly hedging for Shou Feng Yong), Yi Feng Yong was within 4,000, and Zhi Feng Yong, Qian Chang Xiang, Bing Xing, etc. were about 1,000 or so, Run Chang had over 2,800 contracts, while the shorts like Heng Xing even had over 1,700 contracts, Zhao Feng Chang, Tong Tai Chang, etc. were about 1,700 contracts, and the others had no bulk numbers. Those who had not settled properly in August only paid about 2 taels extra this week, and were finally settled. All spot goods were hedged by the Central Bank with American dollars to the same industry. The current reserves in Shanghai are not thin. Yesterday, it was heard that more than 4,000 taels of cash were shipped from the Northeast, but were detained by the Japanese side in Dalian. However, transportation may not be easy in the future. Recently, the red bars are going smoothly, and their price is 9 taels higher than the term marks. The general situation of the week is summarized below.</p>
<p>(Monday) Large bars and silver prices both rose by 0.125, the exchange rate rebounded by 0.25, the prime bill hung long by 0.125, as did the American dollar. As for the gold price, the opening price slightly fell by four cash, totaling 747 taels and a half. Then, large households dumped, and Mr. Wu also unloaded, so the price plummeted by more than 5 taels, eventually reaching 41 taels and 8 cash. Afterwards, the buyers were active, so it turned bullish, totaling 46 and subtracting more than 1 tael, closing at 43 taels and 3 cash, a further decrease of 4 taels and 6 cash compared to the previous Saturday. The largest daily fluctuation was 7 taels and a half, the smallest was 1 tael and 8 cash, totaling 5 taels and 7 cash up and down. Various firms such as Tong Tai Chang covered more than 1,000 contracts, Mr. Wu slightly sold, and Yuan Xing Yong bought in for Shou Feng Yong's hedging. The forward contract transaction was 1 tael and 9 cash, still posted by the bullish side.</p>
<p>(Tuesday) Large bars shrank by 0.0625, American silver rebounded by 0.125, which was due to the large exchange rate relationship. The prime bill rose by 0.125, and the American dollar followed suit by 0.25, internally flat. The gold price initially opened with a small decrease of 1 tael and 8 cash, totaling 741 taels and a half, then 1 tael and 2 cash. Afterwards, all parties entered, and at noon it was 46 taels, then closed at 45 taels and 1 cash. In the afternoon, the market opened at 45 taels, then 46 taels and a half, then Zhi Feng Yong Rui Xing bought in for Qiao Rifu, finally, Heng Xing and others sold, so it became 44 taels, closing at 4 taels and 6 cash, a rebound of 1 tael and 3 cash compared to the previous day. In one day, the Central Bank hedged 400 to 500 spot contracts.</p>
<p>(Wednesday) Large bars rose again by 0.125, American silver did not change, the prime bill was the same, the American dollar hung small by 0.125, because the exchange rate suddenly turned to fall by 1.125, and the gold market opened at 47 taels and a half, plus 2 taels and 9 cash, actually the private telegram was small 0.0625. Afterwards, the sellers showed their courage, retreating to 45 taels and 8 cash, then the exchange market turned better, foreign merchant Qiao Rifu arrived, and the demand from various firms exceeded the supply, the market price gradually rose by 6 taels or more, already breaking out of 50 taels, and it was heard that the Central Bank had hedged cash again, and people's hearts were shaken, reaching 52 taels and 3 cash at noon, closing at 51 taels and 4 cash, another increase of 6 taels and 8 cash compared to the previous day. The largest in the forenoon was 52 taels and 3 cash, the smallest was 45 taels and 8 cash, totaling 6 taels and a half of fluctuation. In the afternoon, due to the hot weather, it was a half-day rest as usual.</p>
<p>(Thursday) Large bars shrank back by 0.0625 to 0.125, American silver shrank by 0.25, the exchange rate was reported to be lower again, so the prime bill did not change, the American dollar hung small by 0.125, the internal trend was loose. The gold market initially opened plus 1 tael and 4 cash, totaling 52 taels and 8 cash. Afterwards, it hovered around 50 taels.

Yifeng Ruixing and others dumped very hard, so it closed at 48 taels and 6 cash at noon. In the afternoon, it was 48 taels and 9 cash, entering later seeing 50 taels and 2 cash, but the closing price was still slightly weak, being 48 taels and 2, a decrease of 3 taels and 2 cash compared to the previous day.

<p>(Friday) Bars rose again by 0.0625 to 0.125, American silver did not move, the prime bill hung long by 0.125, and the American dollar did not change, which was due to the exchange rate continuing to fall. The internal market was also the same, with the strange trend of British silver rising and American silver falling. The gold price initially opened plus 3 taels and 1 cash, totaling 51 taels and 3 cash, then 1 tael and 8 cash to 50 taels and 6 cash, then 52 taels and 3 cash, which was because the cash inflows and outflows were inconsistent, and people's hearts were uneasy.

The largest for half a day was 49 taels and 4 cash, the smallest was 46 taels, a difference of 3 taels and 4 cash.

<h3>Daily Interest Rates All Fell, Situation Almost Decayed</h3>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday, a bank holiday. The market, both foreign and domestic, saw the daily interest rate rise in the morning and fall in the afternoon. The morning market was at 6 mace 7 fen 9 li and a half, while the afternoon market was at 6 mace 8 fen 8 li 8 hao 7 si and a half. The result seemed to be slightly better than the previous day's afternoon market by 1 hao and 2 hu and a half, but the situation was ultimately weak and unable to hold. The silver daily interest rates for both the morning and afternoon markets were at 6 fen. The amount of remittances made was 285,000 in the morning market and 295,000 in the afternoon market. Banknotes only saw 50,000 in over-the-counter transactions in the morning market, and no transactions in the afternoon market. The amount of daily interest rate transactions was around 6 million. The money shops' foreign public receipts and disbursements were over 5.7 million, and the silver public receipts and disbursements were over 27 million. The amount of remittances from various routes was over 400,000. Subsidiary coins Jiangnan small silver dollars were both 5 mace 9 fen 9 li in the morning and afternoon markets, with only 3,000 jiao traded in the morning market. Guangdong small silver dollars were also both 5 mace 8 fen 4 li in the morning and afternoon markets, with 70,000 jiao traded in the morning market and 15,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins remained at 430 qian wen, with over 50,300 qian wen traded.</p>
<h3>July's Silver Market Firmly Grounded</h3>
<p>The silver daily interest rate in July was mostly occupied by about 1 qian for many days, but the time within the 1 qian level was also mostly occupied. Therefore, the total amount of the monthly silver daily interest rate market price was less than 3 taels, being 2 taels and 9 qian. Calculated by 31 days, the average daily amount was about 9 fen 3 li 5 hao 5 si, which seemed to be slightly better than June. However, the resolution on the regular meeting's deposit interest rate tomorrow is said to be around the 3 tael 95 discount.</p>
<h3>Securities: Bond Market Weekly Report Before and After Settlement</h3>
<p>Market Conditions Poor, Prices Decline Significantly</p>
<p>Turnover Exceeds 19 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Last week (from July 25th to 30th), the trading situation on the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange was as follows: spot trading was extremely rare, with a total weekly turnover of only 73,500 yuan. Of this, 25,000 yuan was for 1920 Customs Bonds, 16,000 yuan for 20-Year Bonds, and the rest were only a few thousand yuan each. Forward trading was also lower than before. Excluding Friday, when the market was closed for settlement, the first two days of the week and the last day each saw approximately 5 million yuan in trading, with 4.9 million yuan on Thursday, and only slightly over 1.5 million yuan on Wednesday. Moreover, July forward contracts were only traded in the first two days of the week, and were suspended from Wednesday onwards in preparation for settlement. Although September forward contracts opened on Thursday, trading was extremely thin. Therefore, only August forward contracts saw significant trading throughout the week. According to statistics, the total turnover of various bonds for the entire week was 19,175,000 yuan, a decrease of more than 8.9 million yuan compared to the previous week. Among them, salt taxes accounted for the largest share, at 4.42 million yuan, divided into 985,000 yuan for July contracts, 3.43 million yuan for August contracts, and 5,000 yuan for September contracts. Other notable amounts included 560,000 yuan for July unified tax bonds and 2.13 million yuan for August contracts; 790,000 yuan for July 20 Customs Bonds and 1,695,000 yuan for August contracts; 315,000 yuan for July Disbandment Bonds and 2,045,000 yuan for August contracts; 600,000 yuan for July 20-Year Bonds and 1.4 million yuan for August contracts; 380,000 yuan for July 1931 Bonds and 1.39 million yuan for August contracts; 485,000 yuan for July 1920 Customs Bonds and 1,355,000 yuan for August contracts. Other bonds saw less trading, such as 350,000 yuan for July Readjustment Bonds and 480,000 yuan for August contracts; 80,000 yuan for July Customs Bonds and 140,000 yuan for August contracts; 70,000 yuan for July 6% Consolidation Bonds and 200,000 yuan for August contracts; 100,000 yuan for July 1996 Bonds and 110,000 yuan for August contracts. There was no market for financial bonds.</p>
<p>Regarding the price fluctuations of various bonds during the past week, the market was generally quiet due to the month-end settlement period. Furthermore, the overall environment was unfavorable, and most transactions were conducted by small retail investors, with very few large institutional investors participating. This led to an oversupply, resulting in weak prices. On Monday, prices fell by between 34 jiao and over 1 yuan. On Tuesday, prices fluctuated by about 5 jiao. On Wednesday, prices fell again by 56 jiao. On Thursday, the downward trend continued. On the last day of the week after settlement, the decline was even more severe. This was due to the deterioration of both domestic and international conditions, which created a sense of uncertainty among investors. The market was dominated by selling, with very little buying interest. As a result, prices plummeted by 1 to 2.5 yuan. Compared to the previous week, the price drops for August forward contracts were as high as 3 to 4 yuan, except for July contracts, which could not be accurately compared due to trading only occurring in the first two days of the week. While it is currently difficult to predict the future of the bond market, the increasingly severe situation and the post-disaster economic depression, combined with the sharp decline in tax revenue and the country's financial difficulties, do not bode well for the future. The following table lists the high and low prices and fluctuations of various bonds during the past week (in yuan):</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn: Under Control of Bulls and Bears</h3>
<p>Weekly Tendered Yarn</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market showed a hovering trend last week. The actual demand was relatively sluggish, not as smooth as before. Investor confidence was declining, and the market was relatively soft. However, after large-scale purchases by various merchant guilds, there should be a period of tranquility. The factories' spot goods have been depleted, and there is no inventory at all. Therefore, the factories' minds are firm and determined, and they are unwilling to sell spot yarn at lower prices. However, some large players are selling off in the futures market, exploring the intention that the world yarn market is still in an unpredictable atmosphere, and the southern ports have purchased a lot of spot packages. They are deeply afraid of a long-term stagnation, so they tend to short. As for Rongxing buyers, in view of the domestic climate this year being favorable and rainfall being well-distributed, the rice harvest in the Yangtze River basin is expected to be abundant. It is predicted that the demand from farmers will be strong, and the inventory is also very scarce. They still absorb and long when the price falls. However, both the long and short sides have considerable strength. However, based on the general trend, the price of 50 taels of cotton yarn is temporarily likely to be stable. First, the US cotton situation is flat, although there is no big increase, there is also no decline. Second, the inventory is scarcer than before. Therefore, if business continues to come, of course there is a hope of rising. However, the Japanese military's invasion of Jehol policy is still actively proceeding, which has a significant impact. The tendered yarn market price fluctuates up and down with the rejection action, and people's hearts are different. As a result, the price of each month fell by 6 qian to 2 liang 1 qian compared with last week. The total weekly turnover was 209,700 packages. Merchant guilds bought 9,055 packages of spot yarn. The market price fell by 12 liang compared with the previous week. The amount purchased by each merchant guild is listed as follows:</p>
<p>| Merchant Guild | Packages |</p>
<p>|---|---|</p>
<p>| Sichuan | 190 |</p>
<p>| Shantou | 995 |</p>
<p>| Wuhu | 155 |</p>

<h3>Last Week's Cotton Prices</h3>
<p>Rising with the Climate</p>
<p>Smooth Raw Cotton Consumption</p>
<p>The cotton market has been strong over the past week. Spot cotton sales are good, and the stock of cotton is thin, so the market is more tight. The demand for cotton yarn is strong, and factories have sold a lot of cotton yarn. They have to buy more raw materials accordingly, so the factory demand has improved greatly, and people's confidence has strengthened. In addition, the new cotton crops are suffering from drought, and the cotton leaves are in danger of withering. Therefore, the market atmosphere is even more attractive. However, some speculators in cotton futures tend to sell short, and the amount of packages is increasing. However, in fact, the cotton market is not easy to fall back for a while. There are several major reasons: First, most of the US cotton is bearish, but recently the situation has not increased greatly, nor has it shown a downward trend, but has gradually increased. The spot goods have also reached six points outside the customs, and have risen by more than 100 pounds from the low. Second, the stock of cotton is too small. Those who deliver goods in July are not prosperous, which shows that the bottom goods are thin. Therefore, even with the pressure of extremely large short positions, the market can still support it. What is the future? It still depends on US cotton and exchange rates as the first key. The price of each month in the tendered cotton market rose by 1 qian to 5 and a half qian compared with last week. The total weekly turnover was 338,000 dan. US cotton rose by 30 pounds compared with the previous week. The amount and price of spot cotton purchased by various manufacturers are listed as follows:</p>
<p>| Cotton Name | Highest Price | Lowest Price | Turnover | Term |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| Lingbao Cotton | 34.75 | 33.25 | 2,070 Pieces | Spot Delivery to Factory |</p>
<p>| Huo Ji Cotton | 30.00 | 29.25 | 1,600 Bales | Spot Delivery to Factory |</p>
<p>| Shaanxi Cotton | 32.00 | 30.00 | 1,800 Pieces | Spot Delivery to Factory |</p>

<p>| December | 31.85 | 31.25 | 31.60 | Up 0.10 |</p>
<h3>US Cotton Continues to Rise, Indian Cotton is Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton was firm due to the strength of Wall Street, short covering, and lack of sellers. Futures rose by 4 to 6 points, and spot goods rose by 5 points. British cotton was closed. Indian cotton was sold by speculators, and the market was calm. Pingle fell by 1.75 rupees, Omra fell by 1.25 rupees, and Bailuoxi fell by 0.5 rupees.

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>De Valera Guides the People to Eliminate Luxury and Entertainment</h3>
<p>--- Buddha</p>
<p>According to a Reuters dispatch from Dublin yesterday, tens of thousands of people gathered at the Green College in Dublin today to welcome de Valera, the leader of the Free State. Mr. de Valera began his national propaganda today to guide the actions of the Chinese people in the national crisis. Mr. de Valera said that the people should not be alarmed, spend money properly, and eliminate luxury and entertainment, and quickly meet their financial obligations. Those of us who listen, these are the words of the Englishman de Valera, these are the words of the leader of the Irish Free State in the national crisis to guide the people. It makes us now understand the psychology of the general people. Anything a Chinese says, no matter how valuable it is, they are always unwilling to believe. Even the words of the sages and virtuous men are considered decadent, outdated, and not in line with the trend of the world. Now the above words are the words of foreigners, the words of the leader of the Free State, and should be paid attention to.</p>
<p>Suppose the above words came from the mouth of an uneasy person? They would laugh at me for being a miser, or laugh at me for being a capitalist on probation, because I am, after all, a Chinese. The words of the Chinese are completely worthless. The above are the words of the leader of the Free State, so they are worth introducing. Is British production backward? Is it not like our country? Is British poverty and financial exhaustion not like our country? Is the so-called national crisis in Britain not like our country? However, de Valera, the leader of the Free State, began his national propaganda and said: [Spend money properly, and eliminate luxury and entertainment.] I would like to ask, what is the current situation in our country compared with that of Britain? The number of unemployed people is increasing day by day, while the degree of luxury is increasing day by day. The opportunity for production is diminishing, while the desire for life is increasing. Those who have no money suffer all day long and cannot even get a full meal, while those who have money live extravagantly and squander without restraint. What hope is there for salvation from this kind of畸形 development?</p>
<p>There are three reasons for this. First, the children of the poor, suddenly promoted to high positions, must enjoy all the happiness in the world before they are satisfied, so-called poor children suddenly become rich. They don't know what to do with their hands. Second, how the country's future will be is still unknown. [Enjoy the wine today, worry about the money tomorrow.] They are happy to take pleasure for a while and never plan for tomorrow. Third, a great man is not born to eat from five tripods, and he will die to be cooked in five tripods. Everyone abandons the right path and goes to seek a shortcut to rise to a high position and become rich. This kind of psychology has more than enough to destroy the country. Since the Revolution of 1911, this kind of atmosphere has been quite infected. In Liang Rengong's [The Principle of Continuing Revolution] in the second year of the Republic of China, there were similar words, and now the degree is even higher.</p>
<p>There are still many mentalities that can destroy China, and advocating luxury and not engaging in production is also one of the elements. If you want to eliminate this trend, those in power must first promote it by example, and the people should also fundamentally realize it in their conscience and strive to be frugal. Yesterday, de Valera's words were a needle to prick the root of the British people's illness. I think this prescription, if used to treat the Chinese people's problems, is even more of a good medicine for the right disease.</p>
<h3>Literature and Art</h3>
<h3>Song of Worrying About the World</h3>
<p>--- Songfu</p>
<p>The navy and army come secretly, who does not worry about the enemy's return? The people suffer and still think of the pain, most afraid of the outbreak of war between the two sides.</p>
<p>Zhabei was originally entered into the battle map, and was the first to suffer difficulties in the Soviet Union. Now don't talk about sad things, one general becomes famous and ten thousand bones wither.</p>
<h3>Feeling Nostalgia in Shanghai</h3>
<p>--- Zhangzhen</p>
<p>The wild grass is still red with blood from the war, how can I bear to revisit the old traces? Hong'er does not understand the hatred of rise and fall, and the strings and pipes are still noisy in the evening wind.</p>
<p>I am afraid to talk about old travels to the ends of the earth, old travels are like dreams at the west end of the sea. When I come in the morning, I take care of my troubles, and the tears are full of sorrow.</p>
<p>Science</p>
<h3>Talking Pictures</h3>
<p>--- Dream</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Great Light Theater first screened talking pictures, it has become popular for a while. When it was first invented, there was sound only during singing and dancing. Later, it was gradually invented and partially improved, using the mutual changes of electricity, light, and sound, to become today's lifelike talking pictures. But how talking pictures make sound, I am afraid that those who have seen it cannot fully understand. Therefore, I will describe the invention process and the principle of how it can make sound below. I hope that the readers will be happy to hear it.</p>
<p>(1) The earliest talking pictures were just the work of connecting film projectors and phonographs. When shooting a film, the phonograph simultaneously recorded sound. The film is no different from a non-constant record, except that the diameter is larger, which can provide longer singing time. There are starting points on both the film and the sound film. When it is shown, the film is shaken. At the same time, due to the lever connection, the phonograph also starts to rotate. Because the speed of the film and the sound film has a certain ratio (usually 100 feet per minute for the film and 100 revolutions per three minutes for the sound film), the sound and shadow completely match each other. However, this device is only suitable for continuous singing and dancing. If the starting point is wrong, the sound and shadow cannot match. Moreover, the sound is behind the audience, and it cannot be like the actors' mouths on the screen. All these shortcomings have been eliminated.</p>
<p>(2) Talking Pictures in the Transition Period｜Vitaphone｜The structure of Vitaphone is the same as above. However, electricity is used to transmit the sound to the back of the screen. When the sound film rotates, the vibration of the needle generates currents of different strengths, which are sent to the back of the screen and released in the loudspeaker behind the screen after being amplified by the vacuum tube. There are many small holes in the screen, so that the sound is similar to the tone of the actors in the play. A silencer is also installed in the machine to reduce the noise caused by the friction between the needle and the sound film.</p>
<p>(3) Current Talking Pictures｜Movieton｜Due to the invention of sound and light conversion, talking pictures have been perfectly created. During photography, the waves of sound are converted into light waves of different densities and strengths by the action of electricity and captured by the camera. The shape is black and white stripes, some sparse and some dense. This sound wave film is attached to the side of the film. When it is shown, light is projected through the film and also through the soundtrack to reach the photo electric cell. It is then restored to sound waves. This kind of light electrical appliance, similar to a light bulb, can generate currents of different sizes depending on the strength of the light received, and then reach the loudspeaker behind the stage through the amplifier of the Du Kong tube and release it.</p>
<p>The current talking pictures are all of the third type. The principle is very simple, but the manufacture of the two photoelectric devices that convert sound into light and light into sound is very complicated. This photoelectric device is divided into three layers, three layers are potassium hydroxide, and one layer is metal (Active metal). But how exactly it is made, the inventor is still keeping the secret.</p>

<h3>Improving Eating Habits</h3>
<p>--- Yiyiguan Zhuren</p>
<p>Dear readers, you must be surprised to see my topic of [Improving Eating Habits], thinking that how can eating in life be improved? Please listen to my explanation below,</p>
<p>If you are wrong, please do not hesitate to enlighten me.</p>
<p>Chinese people have always practiced [communal eating], what is [communal eating]? It is to fill a bowl with dishes and provide it for several people to take turns eating with chopsticks, taking food from this bowl, which is called [communal eating]. This [communal eating] has been popular in China for a long time, and it is safe and sound, but thinking carefully, it is very dangerous | and there is a need for improvement. Because a few people eat a bowl of dishes or a bowl of soup together, after repeated washing of everyone's chopsticks and spoons, this bowl of dishes or soup will invisibly add a lot of saliva. If one of these people has tuberculosis or other infectious diseases, then his bacteria will inevitably spread from his chopsticks or spoons to the dishes. Other healthy people who eat these dishes contaminated with bacteria will be in danger! Therefore, European and American countries practice [separate eating]. Although there are several people at the same table when they dine, the soup and dishes they eat are different for each person. It is nothing more than this attention.</p>
<p>I think that in recent years, Chinese people have Europeanized everything, so why not improve and Europeanize this eating matter? Or each person should prepare two pairs of chopsticks and spoons, one for taking dishes and one for eating. But it is so easy to get entangled and troublesome. It is better to have each person have his own dishes, which is more convenient and economical. Because [communal eating] dishes are often more than a dozen kinds. If the table is full, if [separate eating] can really be implemented, each person will have at most one soup and one dish, which is suitable for one person's capacity. It is both hygienic and economical. Why not do it?</p>
<h3>Reply to the Society Improvement Discussion Group</h3>
<p>— Cheng Peng</p>
<p>Regarding the discussion on improving men's clothing, an incidental suggestion was made to improve women's shorts. On July 25th of the 21st year, I saw Mr. Huai Jingcheng's suggestions for improving men's and women's clothing published in Shen Bao. His meaning can be roughly divided into two points:</p>
<p>1.  Men's long gowns, which drag in the mud and water, should be improved, but Western suits are too troublesome and too aristocratic. He advocates wearing school uniforms on the upper body and shorts on the lower body to reduce heat.</p>
<p>2.  It is not appropriate for women to wear stockings and shorts because (A) the shorts are short and the stockings are thin, so they cannot keep out the cold in winter, and (B) they are detrimental to social morality and lead young people astray. I am a soldier and am not qualified to talk about sociology, let alone join the discussion on improving social problems. However, since wise men want to improve the existing bad society, it is okay to offer my humble opinion for those in the know to laugh at. Therefore, I have raised the above points of Mr. Jingcheng for discussion, and I hope that you will enlighten me.</p>
<p>In European and American countries, workers and farmers all wear suits, and even beggars wear suits. I don't understand what Mr. Huai means by calling them aristocratic. Japanese middle school students and others mostly wear cloth suits due to economic reasons, and their value may not be very high, so I am afraid they are not aristocratic. When wearing a suit, a pair of trousers and a coat are tied together, which does not seem very troublesome. White linen clothes and trousers are also not very hot. If you want to be too simple and too long and hot, why not learn from the South African black people who wear nothing at all, then the degree of coolness seems to be far better than shorts. School uniforms are originally a variation of military uniforms. After the Japanese Restoration and conscription, the Japanese became accustomed to wearing military uniforms and learned that they were more convenient than kimonos. Therefore, after retiring from the army, they still used other materials to imitate them. Students mostly wear them due to economic reasons, but professionals mostly wear suits due to etiquette. Social composition does not include the student class. When dealing with public affairs, visiting friends, there is etiquette. What kind of system is it to wear a school uniform on the upper body and a pair of short pants on the lower body? European and American military generals wear military uniforms and swords, civil officials wear high crowns and tailcoats, and even store managers wear formal clothes to work, so as to show caution and express the national demeanor. At the Lausanne Conference, the Soviet Russian communist representatives also wore formal clothes, so the importance of etiquette is known even to the Communist Party. When an American reporter went to see Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek, Chiang was wearing a Zhongshan suit at the time. The reporter published in the interview that Chiang's attire was very similar to that of a cafe waiter, which shows how much Americans value etiquette. In ancient China, people originally wore high crowns and broad belts, and there were clothes for etiquette. Modernization cannot use it. The long robes and mandarin jackets of the Qing Dynasty were also not produced domestically. Since the Republic of China, no new clothes have been created, only temporary Western suits. I think the strange appearance of the Chinese people is already enough, and it is not necessary to create new patterns. The woman's shorts are short and the stockings are thin, and the layer that cannot keep out the cold in winter, I think there is no need to worry too much, because the length of the woman's coat is enough to keep the temperature. Doctors say that the legs will not be damaged by the cold. The climate in China is not as cold as Alaska, so there is no need to copy the old scholars' four pairs of pants (flannel pants, lining pants, cotton pants, leggings all worn together), and the legs are as thick as pillars, which seems indecent.</p>
<p>The woman's thighs are exposed to the outside, which is detrimental to social morality and leads young people astray. This is the judgment of a person full of lewd thoughts. Western philosopher Anatole France said, "There is nothing bad in customs, but people want to think badly. (Iln,y a pas de mal danses moeurs c,est parce pue L,bomeve,)" Are the human body statues in London's Berlin Park mostly encouraged by the government to prostitute? I think the greatest shame of a nation is to only know about lewdness and not about beauty, and it will be difficult to get rid of the smell of primitive tribes. Assuming that seeing two thighs will be tempted by him, then what should he do if he is unfortunate enough to see his mother's two thighs? Is it his own fault that modern young people go astray, or is it the thighs that misled him? Those who are wise will have a fair judgment, (unpaid)</p>

<h3>A Notice of Widow's Remarriage</h3>
<p>— Ms. M</p>
<p>Yesterday, I saw in this column a report by Mr. Shizhi about remarriage. After seeing it, it seemed to be the same as what I knew. However, Mr. Shizhi did not record her notice before remarriage. Now I would like to introduce it. After seeing it, you can know that a widow who has received higher education, for the needs of sex and the love of money, has done this pitiful thing. In fact, from a legal standpoint, she can freely remarry, so why is such a statement necessary? Her notice is as follows:</p>
<p>Mr. So-and-so... We feel very embarrassed to inform you of this sentence: We are now united. We know that among many friends, especially because of concern, there will be dissatisfaction and criticism. Of course, everything should be appropriate. Appropriate is beautiful and good. Otherwise, it is unnecessary. We are also worried that our union may have gone too far.</p>
<p>We should declare that our original intention is contradictory to our current behavior. Therefore, we have to state the course of events.</p>
<p>Speaking of our acquaintance, it was six or seven years ago. The friendship is very long. Last year, for the education problem of orphaned relatives and friends, we were driven by a sense of moral responsibility and worked together with great enthusiasm. In the autumn, I suddenly had a relapse of an old illness. For the sake of worry and care, we often met from time to time. My body is so weak, and the environment is naturally depressed. Comfort and care among confidants is actually very plain and unpretentious, and I am confident that there is nothing that can be criticized.</p>
<p>During the winter vacation, I returned to my hometown. At that time, my body had not yet recovered. During the January 28th Incident, I suffered huge losses, almost losing my life. News was delayed. We were extremely concerned about each other. In order to know the situation of both sides as soon as possible, I was very anxious in my heart. The letters that came and went were naturally more frequent. As a result, my family suddenly became suspicious, secretly opened and hid the letters, and threatened to drive me out. I repeatedly defended and questioned. Because I was confident that there was nothing else, I defended myself, and the act of opening letters was an infringement of my freedom, so I questioned and coerced them, but my family was evasive and sophistical to me.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>· It has been delayed for four or five months, and I finally feel that there is no sincerity. To put it simply, they naturally have other intentions. As for the letters that were secretly opened, although the words cannot be fully remembered, they were all words of earnest inquiry and great concern. However, because of the continuous posting, they used it as an excuse, and even insisted that they had the right to open and view them.</p>
<p>For six or seven years, I have been careful and kept to the rules, and did not think about other things. The reason is that my relatives and flesh and blood have died almost completely in a short period of time, and I have suffered extremely painful experiences.</p>
<p>I often think to myself that this life is like having a nightmare. From now on, I only hope not to add to the troubles, so why bother to fall into the devil's clutches again. This is one reason. Also, my personal old ethical views are still deep, and I know that the remote places are not comparable to the major cities, and I really can't bear to see people have the feeling of losing their son and wife. This is the second reason. You should know that my love of cleanliness and chastity comes from my personal willingness and is absolutely free. If it is for fear of people's criticism, then I have lost the meaning of my original wish. If you say that there is a coercive force that forces me to do so, then there is even less to say. Originally, they treated me with such means, and I could simply declare that I was separated and it would be over. Why bother to waste words to defend and question, but I really don't want to change my environment, so I repeatedly tolerate them, so that they can understand and live as usual. Who knows that their brains are inherently muddled, and their methods are especially vicious. In the end, they gave me despair. I understand very well that if I seek understanding too weakly, it will appear that I am somewhat humble, and I certainly don't want to. Also, if I want to live with them again, it will be very boring.</p>
<p>People say that etiquette is a trap that eats people. I think if I really sacrificed for the sake of etiquette, there would still be a name. Now, like me, being lightly buried by those insidious and poisonous demons who are confused and muddled, I really feel that it is not worth it. So in the end, I still have to break away from them.</p>
<p>However, I have been so deeply stimulated that I can't help but feel depressed. In the past few months, living here and there is very harmful to my sick body. Although I also have the skills to make a living, who can avoid illness and old age?</p>
<p>Xu Chun saw this situation, traced the origin, and silently calculated the future. The ancients said that the person who tied the bell must untie it. Naturally, I can't care about people's comments. I can only seek peace in my conscience. For this reason, after a lot of consultation, frank expression, and various arrangements, I agreed. We dare not say that this is an appropriate union, but we have to do it.</p>
<p>Here, we earnestly hope for the sympathy of our dear friends, and with the utmost respect and sincerity, we decline material gifts of congratulations - K and Ms. M respectfully</p>
<h3>Description of a Woman</h3>
<p>Drastic Change· Ming</p>
<p>A year ago, who didn't know Ms. Zhang as a simple and book-loving female student? She had jet-black hair, an oval face, and a curved figure, but she didn't wear makeup or fancy clothes, and she never thought of showing off her curvaceous beauty. Originally, she only knew that "studying now and saving the country in the future." Ms. Zhang was talented and diligent, so her overall average score was often above 90 points, and she had been a free student for several years. It's no wonder that her teachers valued her very much, and even I admired her to the point of bowing down.</p>
<p>Last summer vacation, she graduated from XX Girls' Junior High School, and was admitted to dare XX Middle School with one exam. It is a co-educational school. I thought that, based on her past grades, she would definitely stand out from the crowd and defeat the male students. Who knew that the facts were not so. On this semester's report card, most of them barely passed, and there were two subjects that only had more than 50 points. As I see it, it's probably because the courses in male schools are deeper and more important than those in female schools.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, my friend came back from XX Park with a smug look on his face, as if he had made a new discovery, and said to me: "XX Park is quiet and cool, it is really a paradise! In the depths of the green shade, there is a modern couple sitting there. The man has a long, round face, smooth hair, a suit and leather shoes, and is extremely handsome. The woman has an oval face, a fashionable cheongsam, and full breasts, revealing her curvaceous beauty. They are whispering sweet words. Do you know who that woman is? It's Ms. Zhang from XX Middle School." My friend said with great relish, but I always thought that the woman was definitely not Ms. Zhang. In the end, I formally warned him not to slander the simple and book-loving Ms. Zhang, as this is a matter of reputation.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, after finishing my official business, I was on my way back from the company when I passed by XX Grand Theater. It happened that the movie had finished, and one by one, pairs of spectators were pouring out of the gate. Suddenly, I saw a modern couple walking forward hand in hand. Their posture was exactly the same as the couple my friend had mentioned in XX Park the day before. I took a closer look, and to my surprise, the woman was indeed the simple and book-loving Ms. Zhang, and the man seemed to be Chen XX, the chairman of the XX Association in her school.</p>
<p>Ah! Studying to save the country? Or falling in love to save the country?</p>

<p>The "Three-Seven Principles" for Opening Summer Schools· Manqian</p>
<p>Yesterday, I went to the summer school of S School to find a classmate, and as soon as I stepped into the gate, I could hear people inside talking about the "Three-Seven Principles" for opening summer schools. After inquiring, I learned that the inventor of this principle was Principal T of the school. Now I will introduce it to the readers of this publication:</p>
<p>The so-called "Three-Seven Principles" is explained as follows:</p>
<p>First, after the summer school is opened, a considerable amount of tuition fees can be collected. This amount is enough to cover all the expenses in [July]. The original funds can also be saved. As for whether it is pocketed by the principal or used for public purposes, it is impossible to know.</p>
<p>Second, teachers who are hired to teach one course will have an extra income of [Seventy] dollars per month!</p>
<p>Third, it is said that there is such a regulation: students of the summer school who want to apply for S School can have such benefits: the grades of the courses you study, as long as they are above [Seventy] points at the end, then when applying for the exam, these subjects can be exempted from the exam.</p>
<p>The meaning of the ["Three-Seven Principles"] is roughly like this. At that time, after listening to it, I really admired Principal T's painstaking efforts to benefit himself and others!</p>
