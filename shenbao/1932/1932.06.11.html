<h3 id="c1">社會之眞危機彬 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>今人論國是。輒以「抗日」「勦赤」爲打破國難之不二法門。頃近蔣中正氏且已第三次西上督師親勦。期以根本戡定「匪亂」。然而吾人則認爲共黨勢力之所以滋蔓。其唯一之原因。在於大多數人民生計之窮蹙。而人民生計之所以日益窮蹙。則又恰爲少數特殊階級所親手造成。故今日而無以安定民生。則勦共恰爲徒勞。彼流離輾轉求死不得。求生不能成千成萬之大衆。旣爲生活所迫。以入於掙扎求生之路。是則就令共黨眞可以勦而平。槍砲眞可以制止大衆不平之呼聲。然而彼萬千横死之所謂「匪徒。」究誰爲爲之。孰令致之。撫躬自問。其又果能無動於中耶。</p>
<p>今日我國大衆之疾苦情形。殆爲有史以來所未見。累歲戰亂。連年飢饉。帝國主義者之榨取。軍閥貪官汚吏土豪劣紳之壓迫。皆爲致使農村破落。民生窮蹙之根因。前年隴甘旱荒。災民易子而食。賣婦爲餐。去年水災。武漢一帶。災民親多以樹皮草根果腹。即如夙稱富饒之江浙。今亦陷於凋敝不堪之悲境。邇年災荒頻仍。農産累歲歉收。人民輾轉流離。十室九空。一般農民多以糠屑菜葉作食品。最近無錫天上市八士橋附近之農民。且多以一升糠屑作二人一日之糧。溧陽之農民。更有因糠屑不敷作食糧。而以軟石磨粉。糠三石七配合煑食者。嗟乎。此種慘狀。吾人試一默念沉思。固尙能認爲人世間應有之現象耶。然而此尙不過民間疾苦之一角而已。尙有非吾人意料所能及者。其悲慘情狀。殆更不堪言不忍聞。天昏地暗。萬民久已同淪於黑暗之地獄此黑暗之地獄之另一面。則復有窮極奢侈之都市生活。尤以上海爲少數特殊豪富權貴得天獨厚者宴安逸樂之天堂。</p>
<p>彼天堂中之生活則何如。或則承襲先人之遺産。或則憑藉權勢搜刮榨取平民血汗之累積。其本身旣一無所能。復從不一勞其心力。而其食則珍饈。衣則綺羅。居則崇樓大厦冬有避寒之汽管。夏有却署之電扇。行備摩脫。挾嬌妻美妾以兜風。而一般平民則惟有却立於塵土飛揚之路隅。至其經常之生活。則或沉湎舞塲。或躭於烟毒。或豪博狂飲。或作狎邪遊。俾畫作夜。神昏顚倒。窮極奢侈。縱慾盡歡。以視大多數長困於飢寒交迫之悲境之大衆。則一勞一逸。一苦一樂。一則賣盡血汗而仍無以自活。一則宴安逸樂而養尊處優。一席之酒。可供窮人一年之糧。朱門酒肉臭。路有凍死骨。在此對照之下。正無異於一處天堂。一淪地獄。處於天堂者。日以勞苦大衆之血汗。爲歌舞筵前之酒。肉不知人世間更有所謂痛苦事。世間不平平事。固尙有甚於此者耶。物不得其平則鳴。不得其生則鋌而走險。旣不平矣。旣不得其生矣。復欲防過其鋌而走險。是固有可能耶。</p>
<p>吾人認爲世間有此極端不平之現象。誠爲人類之羞辱。吾人認爲我國今日之大患。不爲共黨勢力之滋蔓。而在於此種不平之泥土。此種不平之泥土。不僅爲我國社會之危機。實即世界之危機。如何以消滅此不平之現象。如何以解除此種危機。乃爲當前之大問題。然而解决此一大問題。則又顯然非槍砲所能爲力。老子曰。民不畏死。奈何以死懼之。遠識之士。尙其深味斯言。</p>

<p>韓派張陳兩旅追撃</p>
<p>濟南通信、劉桂堂（即劉黑七）部久擾魯南、爲山東第一大患、民國十七年、黨軍北伐時、劉曾被委爲軍長、參加作戰、黨軍克復山東後、劉駐魯東一帶、未幾奉令調往河南、沿途勒繳民團槍枝、强索借欵、人民不堪其擾、旅復改編爲東北軍新編旅、駐防大名、仍不守軍律、騷擾地方、中央乃於去歲派第四師徐庭瑶部、將其解决、劉復率部突出重圍、竄入魯西、渡黄河由肥城大汶口、仍回魯南而魯東、陷日照、取諸城、回費縣老巢、最近經張福田介紹、由韓復榘收編、部衆共三千餘人、有槍二千餘支、調駐黄河北岸高唐腰站一帶、點騐後、編爲山東警備軍、韓自任總指揮、劉桂堂爲副指揮兼第一路司令、郭馬蜂爲第二路司令、軍餉待遇、悉與第三路同、不料劉仍以爲未足、依然向地方勒索欵項、此次魯北剿匪、劉竟自相驚擾、驅逐縣長、圍繳民團槍枝、韓據報後、即派兵包圍、劉郭等乃於八日早兩點、率部竄河北境、圖往豫北、軍隊正在追剿中、茲分述其情形如下、</p>
<p>匪部暴動　劉桂堂因省軍陸續調魯北甚衆、恐與已不利、决計首先發難、於六日早、先派部隊包圍高唐公安局、逼迫繳械、縣長張克葆、被其驅逐、緊閉城門、僅關兩門以遣送匪部眷屬、高唐人心、驚惶萬分、乃紛紛扶老携幼、逃難出城、省府派駐劉部之敎練軍官等、尙未加殘害、</p>
<p>但被繳械逐出、劉在萬城車站設立之辦公處、有騎兵二十餘名、行一晚調回高唐、郭馬蜂率一部份駐腰站、七日早亦到高唐集合、未入城内、駐城角以取　角之勢、</p>
<p>大舉包圍　魯北剿匪臨時總指揮孫桐萱、得高唐事變警報、一方報告省府、一力令駐德州之八十五旅李漢章部、向西進展、駐東昌之八十六旅陳德馨部、向東北進展、魯北民團指揮趙仁泉部駐臨清、担任北面、駐平原之五十八旅張樹林部、</p>
<p>則在東面、對高唐及腰站取大包圍形勢、總指揮孫桐萱駐平原、指揮一切、李樹春視察平原德州禹城恩縣後、亦到平原、協同進勦、韓主席以高唐距禹城車站僅七十五里、恐該匪襲撃禹城站、妨礙交通、並派手槍旅長雷太平、帶特務營駐禹城、以防萬一、至劉桂堂駐禹城辦公處、六日早爲鋼甲車司令戴鴻賓解散、駐濟南之辦公處、亦爲警備司令部解散、處長徐培彦、聞風先逃、</p>
<p>澈夜戒備　現鋼甲車司令戴鴻賓、帶北平號鋼甲車澈夜巡弋德州張莊間、五十八旅任前線、由平原西進、二十師砲隊、亦由平原進展、二十師騎兵兩連、六日晚九點、由禹城前進、距離高唐僅三四十里、禹城因距高唐較近、戒備尤嚴、下午六時、即關閉城門、泰山號鋼甲車帶特務兵二連、巡弋高唐禹城間、餘二連駐禹城、入夜稽查盤詰森嚴、口令數換、軍隊均露宿、</p>
<p>匪竄河北　各部隊佈置旣竣、七日向前推進、劉桂堂郭馬蜂鑒於高唐城低壕淺、不堪負嵎、遂於八日上午兩點、率部出西門、向河北境内竄去、其目的擬由河北境再竄河南、一說有往投孫殿英之說、因高唐通濟長途電話被其破壞、故各方得報極遲、雷太平於匪竄去後、即於下午二點半、率特務營乘鋼甲車返濟、向主席韓復榘報告、</p>
<p>韓復榘談　省府主席韓復榘談及此事、謂劉部向西南竄去、似欲竄往豫北、已令五十八旅旅長張樹林、八十六旅旅長陳德馨、跟踪追撃、但匪行甚急、未知能否追及、孫師長李廳長已到高唐辦理善</p>
<p>後、高唐損失如何、尙未接報告、并已電</p>
<p>豫北駐軍會剿、又聞孫桐萱李樹春已駛抵清平、指揮各軍追剿、北平號鋼甲、已由平原開禹城待命、</p>
<p>張匪逃竄、魯南著匪張黑臉王常有等部千餘人、請求投誠、經韓復榘派夏子明孟廣山前往接洽、張王等部、乃集南沙河車站、於七日晚九點北關、預定開駐禹城</p>
<p>詎行抵鄒縣南之兩下店車站、忽得解决劉桂堂郭馬蜂等部消息、當即下車奔逃、一部向鐵路西南陽湖一帶竄去、一部向鐵路以東竄回抱　　老巢、但官方事前早有預備、故即由二十二師師長谷良民、</p>
<p>負責追剿鐵路西者、八十一師唐邦植旅與魯南民團謝書實部、負責追剿鐵路東者、務期乘勞肅清、以除民害、</p>
<p>發放株連　至連日捕獲之劉桂堂駐濟辦公處人員、及抗日救國軍人員、計劉桂堂方面、在濟被捕者共三十餘人、在禹城被捕押解來濟者四十餘人、内有婦女十餘人、八日下午、韓復榘提出訊問後即將無關係之嫌疑犯二十餘人、一律釋放、婦女十餘人、俟查明確係善良者、亦即令其家屬領回、至其餘各犯、暫行拘押、又内有夏子明之子一名、韓告以無絲毫危險、不必害怕、惟暫時交公安局長王愷如優待拘押、不使與外間接洽、又抗日救國軍補捕軍長一人、師旅團長軍需等十餘人、均供係閻錫山方面傅存懷等所委任、韓當令暫行拘押、俟調查明白、再行訊辦、（八日）</p>

<p>那裏知道失先生是下了决心要自挑舖蓋下鄉，無論怎樣說，總不肯讓我們挑。他的理由却很簡單。他說：『這是我跟你們學的第一課。鄉下人自挑柴火進城賣，我們應該效法。』可是，我們如何可以依他？他是我們新請的先生，讓他自己挑舖蓋，我們却兩手空空舒舒服服的看着先生流汁，心如何說得過去？最後宋老太提出一個折中的辦法；兩個行李擔四個人輪流挑。不過走近古廟的時候，一定要讓春生哥和鐘兒代挑。宋老太的建議是被雙方接受了。究竟先生的肩脖，嫩得很，小弟弟的更嫩，到了古廟，打開衣服一看，肩上是如同擘痧一般的紅，並且是朣起了兩個肉瘤。小弟弟後來說；睡了一夜格外覺得酸痛。他以爲這次挑擔下鄉是很有意思的。他說他從此不再輕看挑擔的人，因爲他曾經挑過擔子知道出一分力纔能走一步路。這位小弟弟是多麽的可愛啊！</p>
<p>二十二</p>
<p>鄉下人進城閙笑話，那是不必說了。誰知道城裏人下鄉也會閙笑話？我們那位可愛的小弟弟。閙的笑話不比我少。别的不說，只說一件。當我們走到廟門口的時候，小弟弟指着廟前綠油油的田園說：『你們種這許多韮菜，怎麽吃得了？』這句話引得大家哄堂大笑，簡直把一個天眞爛漫的小弟弟都笑獃了。他不知道大家爲什麽笑？還是宋老太嘴快；『這是麥苗，不是韮菜，你歡喜吃菲菜嗎？』小弟弟自己也笑得滿臉通紅。朱先生說：我講過吧，你們能敎我們的東西多着咧。小弟弟！你是多麽幸福呀。宋老太敎你知道麥子是什麽了。你還得把麥苗與菲菜詳細比較一下，找出究竟有什麽分别？你以後只要虚心問人，就能天天長進。至於自己不知道的東西，是要勇於請敎，怯於瞎講，才對。」</p>

<p>棉紗市情晨平午跌、趨勢甚疲、因美棉五分陣綫業已跌破、且實銷客方視環境惡劣、束手不辦、生意愈覺冷淡、買方鑒於世界狀况不景氣、心意漸呈不安、然有一部份廠商頗有維持之念、因底貨囤積、目前未厚、故在近月稍稍購進、總之</p>

<p>棉市異常悲觀</p>
<p>美棉又發現百年間之新低峯、七月份五分關口已衝破、人心大爲震動、買方尚未現十分恐佈之狀、然中國貿易公司鑒於世界潮流激盪、外棉形勢萬分恐懼、在産地收辦之現貨、廠需全無、祗得向期貨市塲套出、以免危險、但一和般申地棉商、以其底盤已小、二十九兩之價數年未有、以爲可無再落之虞、有一部份花商大翻其多頭、然測之大勢狀况、棉市處於十分悲觀之境聞天津棉花亦發現慘落之說、所以標棉前途、尙有一幕激烈之變化實現、</p>

<p>下跌後、其虧損額度、聞有一百六十萬左右、客人堆機及供給欵項者、均分担此項損失所幸客户殷實者居多、虧累尙無所聞、至於津市棉花存底、最近仍在十四五萬包左右云、</p>

<p>中國工藝的不發達，實由於機械器具的不改良。「工欲善其事，必先利其器，」本是中國的老古話。可是在中國人的見解，用利器造成的東西不算什麽希奇。用腐舊，笨拙的傢伙做工，纔算是中國人的技巧。譬如寫字，好好的毛筆不用，反用雞毛寫，用指甲寫，用口咬筆寫，倒算是藝術。</p>

<p>中國的畫，也很少進步。有遠近距離的畫，在中國欣賞家的眼光裏，反認爲卑鄙的匠人畫。中國人祇講究寫字，拿全副藝術的精神，都化在寫字上面。外國字母祗有二十多個，不可以做裝飾品，所以外國人寫字寫得好，不能當做藝術，獨在中國，對客揮毫，可以買錢丨</p>
<p>外國的字是，僧人造的，起初秘而不宣，當做僧人的專利品，到後來纔公開。吾猜想中國字的起源也是如此。其實三四百年前遺留下的字蹟，冩寫得也未見得好，偏有一班念書人閒着没事，想出許多玩意兒，拿碑帖來摹</p>
<p>倣。明明是碑舊了，字跡糢糊了，缺了一筆或少了一點，依樣畫葫蘆，倒算是帖體。吾想王羲之喝醉了酒寫的草字，連自己也不認識，後人却競相臨摹，倒算是一體。於是寫字，也講起體系派别來。某也寫的是漢禁，某也寫的是北魏，某也寫的是顔字，某也寫的是蘇字，弄得五花八門，不在藝術上用功夫，反在派别上相爭吵。這等於保鏣，不問本領的大小，反問誰是他的師傅。</p>
<p>不但寫字如此，連文章也是如此。唐宋以後可以說没有好文章，因爲大家爭立門户，故步自封，不求進步。什麽楊雄體，太史公筆法，韓文，蘇文，······等等。大家祇知道仿古，不知道求進步。章太炎熟讀漢書，竟連古人的破體也當作古體。</p>

<p>又趙生爲余言。二月七日之夜。賊犯某路。時我軍守此路者僅三人。二人方入屋小憇。留一人某應守。賊來犯者甚衆。彈下如雨。而某殊不以爲意。急行至前壘。冠其冠於槍。舉而薦於壘。復左右之。使若數十人者然。賊於火光中望見之。遽發槍。某亦斷續發機關槍以應。倭知有備。彈益密。某度賊不敢猝至。遽奔還招憩者。而援者亦至。倭久不聞我軍聲息。以爲潰走。遂進攻。我軍突起圍之。竟覆其全軍。</p>
<p>又雲生爲予言。粤人陳某。精於射撃。某夜與同伍五六人守北車站某隘。賊軍以三十餘人進犯。勢標甚。同伍皆自危。陳笑曰。視吾爲君等撲殺此撩。乃衆鳴數槍。即走伏壘後十餘丈。賊知有備。攻益烈。陳屏息不之應。持機關槍内向伏壘下隱蔽處。居頃。賊以爲潰矣。乃越壘而前。陳俟其至彼與伏之間。突起撃之。伏</p>
<p>亦盡起以應。賊暗中倉卒。以爲大軍且至。皆棄槍走。亡十餘人。而五六人者竟無恙。</p>

<p>模範的僕役　　模範的僕役。是指英國籍的僕役而言。美國在全盛時代。有許多富豪。到英國去游歷。見英國僕役都是莊嚴而沈著。辦事又能幹。認爲是全世界最良好的僕役。因此帶了好多人回美國去。從此美國社會中。都以有英國僕役爲榮譽的事。飛行大家林白大佐Colonee　Lindbergh的家裏。就有一個很幹練的英國僕役。連庖人和保姆也都是英國人。所以他家的僕人。可算是清一色的英國籍了。美國社會不但喜用英國僕役。連練馬人。騎師。古爾夫球塲俱樂部的侍者。游船的船主。以及酒排間的總管等。也往往僱用英國人充任、他們的待遇優渥。工資特别的大。可是他們不幸也受了全世界經濟恐慌的影響。美國富豪之家破産的很多。再也没有能力僱用英國僕役了。於是最近有大批的英國籍的僕役和庖人。不得不束裝回國去。想在本國得到一個餬口之地。</p>

<p>日海軍全撤期</p>
<h3 id="c148">日將正式答復 <a href="#c148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>約在十三日</p>
<p>日海軍陸戰隊之完全撤退問題、除丁暫駐區外、照停戰協定條文中所規定之四星期限期屆滿後、又越一星期、而日方迄無撤退之確切表示、截止前晚、且發現日兵在沙涇港布崗事、我接報告後、本擬向共同委員會通知、并擬於必要時、召集會議、嗣據報告、昨已撤去、遂即終止、茲分誌各項消息於後、</p>
<p>全撤表示　閘北段淞滬鐵路以東、及沙涇港東部兩處、日海軍陸戰隊之撤退、昨據日方共同委員岡崎表示、撤退日期、尚未决定、該兩處因日僑民甚多、大約須俟日僑之在該處者、可不發生恐慌時、方始撤退、至滬西同文書院·及豐田紗廠·吳淞華豐紗廠·以及平凉路公</p>
<p>大紗廠之少數日海軍、則於最返之不久、Verysoon即可撤退、但公大豐田兩紗廠及同文書完、其地點係住在越界築路（？·）也、</p>
<p>十三答覆　日方共同委員、對我方共同委員所提出要求日兵完全撤退之答復、外傳准於今（十一）日正式答復、據記者詢岡崎、謂十一日因係星期六、但日海軍當道、尙有種種應酬、十二日又屬星期、故正式答復、必須十三日以後、又據共同委員會秘書郎格氏、在電話中語新聲社記者云、日本海軍之撤退、十三日（星期一）當作正式之答復、</p>
<p>未撤兵數　日方軍隊之撤退、據岡崎談、陸軍已撤退、海軍陸戰隊之在吳淞華豐紗廠者、約有四十名、其餘如豐田·公大·兩紗廠、與同文書院之海軍數目、亦大致相同、合計現尙留滬者、雖其確數不得而知、大約在二千五百名以上</p>
<p>佈崗已撤　關於前日下午五時半日軍在沙涇港西面佈崗并架鐵絲網一事、昨晚接管委員會接到五區三分所之報告後、即通知我方共同委員會、請求提出共同委員會交涉、當時俞鴻鈞温應星二委員、對此事略加考慮後、即决定先函共同委員會主席通知、然後在必要時、再召集開會、但至昨日上午、據公安局報告、謂胡家木橋及香烟橋等處鐵絲綱、均已拆除、搜查行人等亦均取消、因之俞等遂即中止向共同會通知、又據報告、前日日軍、僅架鐵絲網及搜查行人、并未佈崗、</p>
<p>昨日雖已撤去、但不時仍有少數散兵發現云、</p>
<p>沙涇港</p>
<h3 id="c149">昨仍發現日兵 <a href="#c149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>胡家木橋鐵絲網已交涉撤去</p>
<p>公安局謂該處不至發生意外</p>
<p>滬東沙涇港以西之區域内、日來時發現日兵、檢查行人、且佈崗位、設鐵網、至引起附近居民虚驚不淺、昨日該處仍有日兵往來、惟據市公安局消息、謂此係日兵連日以來時有之事、不致發生意外、在胡家木橋之鐵絲綱、已於昨日上午撤去、茲將昨日所得消息、誌之如次、</p>
<p>日兵昨仍往來　日本海陸軍戰隊、於前晚昨晚、赴沙涇橋西香烟橋胡家木橋一帶、大肆搜查、至昨日上午十一時、又往該處巡閱、約有三四十名之多、均全體武裝、駕鐵甲砲車、往來巡邏、形勢嚴重、歷一小時始去、</p>
<p>鐵絲網已拆去　日軍前日在胡家木橋裝置之鐵絲網、共長數丈、中餘一狹小之人行道僅容一人通行、越過該橋者、均須搜查、該處鐵絲網裝置後、市公安局據報、即轉知接管委員會、請共同委員會我方委員俞鴻鈞、前往與日方交涉、謂此事極易引起誤會、應請拆除、日方當即令海軍陸戰隊、於昨晨前往拆除、至午後、胡家木橋、已能通行無阻、</p>
<p>日軍巡邏原因　此次沙涇港以西突然發現日兵、外界頗滋疑竇、新聲社記者探悉原因、實係在沙涇港西、有漢奸匿跡該處、開設賭窟燕子窠、現該處大小烟賭窟、達十餘家之多、若輩恐爲官警發覺、將有不利、因之請日軍嚴密戒備云</p>
<p>東區尙屬安謐　記者昨日午後、赴東區沙涇港西及天同路胡家木橋香烟橋等處、見日兵已退去、地方情形尙屬安謐、惟行人頗少、因該處本係荒僻之境、至臨平路·虹鎭·新港·等處、則已爲我方接收、故頗熱閙、商店亦多照常營業、惟入晚仍戒嚴云、</p>
<p>公安局之表示　新聲社記者、於昨晨訪晤市公安局督察長龔璽揆、叩以滬東情形、據云、該處形勢、不如報載之重大、刻地方如常、數日來閘北謡諑繁興、民心惶感、應勸外間勿輕信云云、嗣</p>
<p>又於午後往訪滬東所轄境内之五區三所長吳延勳、據該日兵巡搜之區、即係我方尙未接收之處、因五區三分所之派出所、共有虹鎭新港路臨平路吉祥路歐嘉路平民村六處、現虹鎭新港路臨平路三處、已收回、餘則仍未收回、故而日來之日兵均在未收回區域内發現、測其所來之地點、大概在四區（即閘北區）之日軍守備隊、所派出者、惟僅係巡邏、而並非永久布崗、逗留若干時即去、並無衝突、現該處地點、仍頗安寗也、</p>

<p>第三艦隊之撤退</p>
<p>日本侵滬海軍第三艦隊、除先撤去一部外、尚有留滬旗艦·巡洋艦·十五隊驅逐艦·並海軍一部、準定今日上午、開還東洋、惟日方雖將海軍撤去、而一面則密派大批陸戰隊·與水上警察等來滬、增厚其駐軍實力、茲將此事詳情、經詳細調查、報告如下、</p>
<p>出雲移開　第一艦隊司令野村乘座之旗艦出雲號、向駐日領署前四周布設汽球電網、以防水雷、昨日、野村已下令、着該艦於今晨移到楊樹浦、改泊大阪碼頭、所設電網汽球、即令撤去、艦上有官兵七八百人、昨令不准無故上陸、前次調至陸地者、今晨一律歸艦、野村鹽澤及植松等各司令指揮、準定今日十一時、由大阪碼頭上船、與輕巡洋艦常盤號同時離滬、直放日本、</p>
<p>增艦補充　上海日本海軍、自今日起、表面上恢復一二八前原狀、以後軍艦駐防、歸長江第一外遣隊支配、但星期一、將十五隊四魚雷艦撤回佐世保後、日海軍省又議定以二十四隊驅逐艦四隻、指派來滬、充實上海日海軍之力量、昨已由海軍省電令知照、</p>
<p>密派海軍　第三艦隊開拔之先、日海軍省又從佐世保海軍團内、密調大隊海軍陸戰隊來滬、第一批兵士昨日到滬、有安川·尾松·中村·島田·桑原·吉田勝·古賀等官兵一大隊、其中一部派入上海陸戰隊中、一部令充實二十四艦隊兵額云、</p>
<p>增派水警　日本又派大批水上警察官長來滬、成立水警隊、附屬在日本</p>
<p>領事公署之内、亦爲增厚上海實力之一種、計昨日由長崎神户兩地水上警察署調派來滬之警官、共有吉井·末永·八烟·中井·水田·清瀨·等近二十名先行報到而警士則將陸續派來也、</p>

<p>公共租界工部局宣告、本年一月二十八日起所宣布之戒嚴辦法、自六月十三日、</p>
<p>即下星期一、上午六時起終止、</p>
<p>租界電話工人罷工</p>
<h3 id="c152">形勢愈趨嚴重 <a href="#c152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>因昨晨公司無切實答復</p>
<p>且捕去工人代表等四人</p>
<p>公共體育塲開會亦未成</p>
<p>租界電話公司工人罷工後、公司對於工人提出之新條件、昨仍無切實答復、代表被捕房逮捕、福建路分行、臨時戒嚴、工人在公共體育塲開會亦爲公安局制止、罷工形勢、愈趨嚴重、茲將各項詳情、分誌如下、</p>
<p>臨時戒嚴　公共租界捕房、得報電話公司罷工工人、於十日晨七時、奉罷工委員會命令、在福建路電話分行集合、當於昨日上午六時半、特派中西武裝探捕百餘人、前往臨時戒嚴對於竚立路旁之行人勸告散去、至七時許、罷工工人三五成羣絡續前來、站立路旁靜候公司答復消息、及至九時許、已集至一千人以上、以致交通阻斷、經探捕設法恢復交通、但罷工工人及路人觀者、仍留而不去、</p>
<p>談判無效　及至十時十分、全體工人、見公司對於所提之條件、仍未出來答復、當派代表葉公照·鄭羅傑·徐世杰·潘丁全·等四人、進福建路電話分行、要求謁見大班、由工程師威爾遜接見、對代表說、工人提出之條件、因係中文、現已從事翻譯英文、但現在尙未譯竣、故暫時不能答復、須俟譯竣後、再行答復、該代表等認爲公司太無誠意接受、乃相率退出、</p>
<p>代表被捕　該代表等退出後、當向竚立路旁靜候消息之工人、將談判經過宣佈、全體工人甚爲憤激、乃高呼口號、如「反對公司開除工人、」「不達到目的誓不復工、」「擁護罷工委員會、」等、以致秩序稍亂、中西探捕、當即干涉、并</p>
<p>將全體工人代表葉公照·工人萬瑞春·張榮生·朱子文·等四人拘入捕房、同時將站立路旁之工人、亦均驅散、</p>
<p>制止集會　全體罷工工人、爲捕房驅散後、當即奉罷工委員會臨時緊念命令、齊赴西門公共體育塲開大會、討論進行事宜、及至十一時許、公共體育場集合工人四百餘人、并散發第二次宣言、將開會時、市公安局二區警署、即派警士前來詢問、以核會此次開會、事前未經公安局社會局市黨部許可、當予以勸阻、經工人向警士一再交涉未允、及至十二時許、二區警署、以工人仍未散去、乃加派警士、前往驅散、各工人無奈、始各自散去、</p>
<p>招待記者　罷工委員會昨晨分函各報館通訉社云「逕啟者、工人等爲使各界瞭解罷工眞相起見、特决定於十日上午十時、招待各報記者、地點福建路壺中天茶樓、望貴報館準時派人參加、」及至十時、各報館各通訉社記者前往、</p>
<p>適值工人高呼口號時後因代表被捕、以致招待記者延期、</p>
<p>工人態度　罷工委員會、昨對記者發表罷工眞相云、此次罷工的動機、第一爲求自身之保障、第二爲反對資本家無理壓迫、工人完全是出於自動、决不爲公司造謡而失團結力、</p>
<p>公司發表聲明及啟事、種種想破壞工人、但現在已引起工人更加憤恨、今公司對於工人提出之條件、竟毫無誠意藉詞拖延、但我們全體工人、决繼續罷工、不達到目的不止、我們的各界接洽處、在愛文義路通商旅館、上海電話工人罷委接洽處云、</p>

<p>在一條横線的下面，有如下的兩個簡短的電報：</p>
<p>（一）松下今偕武裝兵六七人，見××</p>
<p>×，質問外部抗議日軍在榆實彈射撃，並彈落城内，是否爲×報告，要求×證明，日軍並未在榆實彈射撃，×未答覆。</p>
<p>（二）由懷集入粤之桂軍，前鋒到廣寗及四會邊境。×××令×××在北海電白建築飛機塲，準備派機赴南路。×××部奉×××令，由北江調省，轉南路；廣三路一帶，連日拉夫極忙。</p>
<p>第一個是日軍要求×某證明，而並未答覆。這是多麽聯秘，奥妙，像棉花絮般的柔軟而富於彈性啊！第二個是連綴着桂軍······前鋒·······準備·····派·····</p>
<p>調······飛機······拉夫等字樣，這是多麽亢爽，明顯，像生鐵般的堅硬而乾脆啊！</p>
<p>「未答覆」三字，不知抹去了多少事實。究竟是「不理睬」呢；還是「默認了呢？抑是「諒解」了呢？我不敢懸揣。</p>
<p>「派······調······前鋒·····拉夫」等動作，眞是又忙碌又緊張。究竟是「勦匪」呢；還是「打自己人」呢？抑是報復「不共戴天」的仇呢？我不敢妄測。</p>
<p>但，同在我國領土之内，同爲一個統兵的軍官，而所有的表現，明明是一個「負」，一個「正」，有誰不信呢？</p>

<p>— 流芳</p>
<p>家庭中之零器小件，大都以銅鐵製成；因其值賤耐用：但易生銹，殊不雅觀，吾人苟能利用化學方法，藥品力量，梁成種種美麗顔色，則銅鐵質雖粗賤，外觀之亦何異於高貴之金屬乎？茲將各色染法，分述於後。</p>
<p>銅件上染白銀色法</p>
<p>水銀二錢　白礬末一錢　二酸化水銀一錢</p>
<p>將上列三物，共研粉末，先將銅件磨光，再將此混合藥粉盡力擦之，其色即與白銀無異。</p>
<p>銅件上染黄金色法</p>
<p>𨦗炭養（即碱）三四兩　白明礬二兩四錢</p>
<p>將上列二物，溶解於三磅之清水内，投入銅件，煎煑成沸，取出後，再用此水洗滌極凈，另用白堊細粉末磨擦之，即呈光亮之金黄色。</p>
<p>銅件上染黑色法</p>
<p>硝酸錫一分　鹽化金二分</p>
<p>先將銅件用白堊粉磨擦光亮，再浸入上列二藥之溶液中，經一刻鐘後取出，用凈布拭乾，即成烏銅矣。銅件上染墨絲緑色法</p>
<p>鹽化第二鐵一分清水二分</p>
<p>先將銅件，磨擦光亮，浸入上列溶液中，因浸漬之久暫，分成色之濃淡。</p>
<p>銅件上染褐色法</p>
<p>硫酸銅一兩　鹽化鋅一兩　清水二兩</p>
<p>先將銅件磨光，用上列溶液塗抹件上，以文火徐徐烘之，使件十分乾燥使得。</p>
<p>鐵件上染白銀色法</p>
<p>血竭四兩五錢　亞砒酸末六錢三鹽化　二兩四錢</p>
<p>將上列三物，與九十度之酒精四磅，共入一器，加以適當熱度，時時振盪，使十分溶化後，再將鐵件磨擦光凈，用此藥液，塗抹件上，待乾燥後即有白銀色之薄膜一層，髹於表面，非但美觀，且能防銹。鐵件上染黄金色法</p>
<p>銷酸錳十四分　純酒精六分</p>
<p>先將鐵件磨擦光凈，在文火上稍熱之，再將海棉蘸上列溶液塗抺件上，待乾再塗，反覆三四次，即呈鮮明之黄金色矣。</p>
<p>鐵件上染黑色法</p>
<p>硝酸銅七分　純酒精三分先將鐵件，磨擦光凈，在文火上稍加熱度，然後取毛刷，蘸上列溶液，塗抺件上，冷却後，件上即結有黑色之酸化銅膜附着，以手剥脫，則膜内件上已有炭色之物質留存，如是行之數回，遂呈有光澤之黑色金屬器矣。</p>
<p>鐵件上染褐色法</p>
<p>鹽化第二鐵八分　鹽化銻四分没</p>
<p>食子酸二分　清水八分</p>
<p>先將鐵件磨光洗凈，乾燥後，用海棉蘸上列溶液，塗抺件上，盡力磨擦，成色深淡，以塗液次數多寡而定，待其染色合宜，小置片時，用清水洗凈乾燥，再用亞麻仁油，塗布件上即得。</p>
<p>鐵件上染炭色法</p>
<p>亞硫酸錏一分六清水六分</p>
<p>將鐵件先照染黄金色法手續染成後，再浸漬於上列溶液中，再三行之，至得適宜之成色爲止。</p>

<p>— 岩野</p>
<p>李先生的小寳寳雄兒，在午飯時還活潑潑地會說會笑的，不知怎樣飯後兩點鐘時便時哭時閙，坐臥不巡了，他夫人趕忙把丈夫從校中呌回來，商量如何辦法，</p>
<p>李先生歸來一見雄兒的狀態，並摸摸他的額上身上，火辣辣的，知道他是無端病來了，他夫人說，快請某某醫生去看罷，不要遲疑，使病加重起來，</p>
<p>李先生蹙着眉說，某某醫生嗎？他確是兒科聖手，但是現在是下午了，他上午才看門診哩，他地人說，那末快去請他來罷，李先生說，請來嗎？可請不起呵，出診要八元八哩，我們有這許多錢嗎？李夫人急得流涙說，前弄裏王醫生，聽說無論何時請他出門看病，祗要一塊錢好了，我們就先請他看一看罷，李先生雖不願延庸醫，但摸摸囊裏，何來八元八，祗得聽從夫人之言，到前弄去請王醫生，當他去時，嘴裏不住的說着窮人生病，不可生在下午啊，</p>
<p>服了王醫生的一劑藥後，雄兒的病不惟不减，反有顯著的進展，這一夜他們夫婦倆没有合一合眼，雄兒身上難過，他們心上尤甚難過，晨上八時，他們倆急急抱了雄兒到兒科聖手那裏，那知捷足先登者已有很多人了，李先生急忙取出一元兩角錢去掛號，已是十九號了，到診病室去看看，醫生還没有來，看鐘上敲九下了，醫生由樓而下，以爲開始診病了，那知他不入診室而出門坐上包車，問諸掛號者，說，這是出早診，人家以八元八角來請去的，這裏門診規定十時才開始哩，李先生聽了，不由得連稱八元八，八元八，</p>
<p>十點鐘了，開始診治了，由第一號看起，已到了八號了，李先生夫婦慶幸着，以爲再有一個鐘頭，可輪到雄兒了，正看着九號過去，忽然跳過十號而看剛來的一位，李先生正要問他爲何不按次序，而後來居上，忽轉念想到這是呌拔號，他是出了加倍診金而才享到這優先權的，於是他又不由得連呼兩元四兩元四，</p>
<p>看到十八號了，十八號人剛從醫生旁的一方凳上站起，李先生抱了雄兒想上去承乏時，突然又是一個拔號，又是一函兩元四的作祟，把他驅在一旁，李先生站在一旁，擔心着再有兩元四來，幸運得很，這一個拔號拔去了，就輪着他的雄兒，他名爲掛的十九號，實爲二十一號，從八時半到此，到十三時才能歸去、</p>
<p>他在歸途中拍着雄兒說，寳寳，以後不好生病拉，萬一生病，不要在下午，因爲下午要八元八哩，又輕輕地拍着說，萬一不幸生了病而到那裏去，不要碰着拔號，我們不能拔，因爲拔要兩元四哩，</p>

<p>往常聽見許多人說，人類愈文明，用腦力的地方愈多，因此人類的壽限也愈短，從一方面看固然很對，可是一般事實却不如此，試看世界各國的人們，並不因文明進步而壽短，反是愈老愈輕健，例如受迪生氏，腦力用得比一般人利害，却不因此壽短，因爲他們能看到這種危險，所以十二分的注意優種學和體育，使各個身體上養成一個强固的基礎，然後勇往直前的做去，即以我們同種的三島國民而論，已經能夠和歐美並駕，注意到這種危險，試看這次日本新組的内閣，閣員中年齡最大的七十九歲，最小的四十九歲，平均起來差不多六十歲，像這種風燭殘年的人還能夠担起國家重任，預備幹一下子，這種體格和精神是多麽使我們驚奇、但到了中國人嘴裏便是「老而不死謂之賊」，</p>
<p>反觀國内的人們却不然，這五十年裏面也算學了些文明的皮毛，腦力却也用得不少，可惜用錯了，專用於自私自利及損人利已一方面，同時不注重優種和體育，以致養成一班病態的靑年，試問這種國民是否能長壽，是否能夠有向前的勇氣，至於年老的，一至五十歲以外，便不想幹下去，告退林下，此之謂「享福」，即使你要幹，人家便說你老朽庸昏，已入打倒之列，所以常常聽見老輩的說，（一代不如一代了！）</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Real Crisis of Society <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Nowadays, people discuss national affairs, invariably considering "resistance against Japan" and "suppression of the Reds" as the two infallible methods to overcome national difficulties. Recently, Chiang Kai-shek has even personally supervised the third westward campaign to fundamentally quell the "bandit rebellion." However, we believe that the reason for the spread of the Communist Party's power lies solely in the extreme poverty of the majority of the people. And the reason why the people's livelihood is becoming increasingly impoverished is precisely due to the actions of a small number of special classes. Therefore, if we cannot stabilize the people's livelihood today, suppressing the Communists will be futile. The masses who are displaced, struggling to die but unable to, and unable to live, are forced by life to embark on the path of struggling for survival. Even if the Communist Party can truly be suppressed and the voice of the masses' discontent can be stopped by guns and cannons, who ultimately caused the so-called "bandits" who died tragically by the thousands? Who brought them to this point? If we reflect upon ourselves, can we truly remain unmoved?</p>
<p>The suffering of the masses in our country today is almost unprecedented in history. Years of war, successive years of famine, the exploitation by imperialists, and the oppression by warlords, corrupt officials, and local bullies are all root causes of rural decline and impoverishment of the people's livelihood. In the drought in Longxi and Gansu in the past year, disaster victims exchanged children to eat and sold wives for meals. Last year's floods in the Wuhan area forced many disaster victims to subsist on tree bark and grass roots. Even the Jiangzhe area, which was once known for its wealth, is now in a state of desolation and misery. In recent years, disasters have been frequent, and agricultural production has been poor for years. The people are displaced and wandering, with nine out of ten houses empty. Most farmers eat bran and vegetable leaves. Recently, farmers near Bashi Bridge in Wuxi and Tianshang City have been using one liter of bran to feed two people for a day. Farmers in Liyang are even grinding soft stones into powder and mixing it with bran at a ratio of three to seven to cook and eat. Alas! If we silently ponder such a tragic situation, can we still consider it a phenomenon that should exist in the human world? However, this is only one corner of the people's suffering. There are still things beyond our imagination, and their tragic situations are almost too unbearable to speak of or hear. The heavens are dark, and the people have long been plunged into a dark hell. On the other side of this dark hell is the extremely luxurious urban life. Shanghai, in particular, is a paradise of ease and pleasure for a small number of special wealthy and powerful individuals who are blessed by heaven.</p>
<p>What is life like in that paradise? Some inherit the legacy of their ancestors, while others rely on their power to extort and exploit the accumulation of the common people's blood and sweat. They themselves are incapable of anything and never put in any effort. Yet they eat delicacies, wear silk and satin, live in tall buildings and mansions with heating pipes in winter to avoid the cold and electric fans in summer to escape the heat, and travel in motorcars, taking beautiful wives and concubines for a drive. The common people, however, can only stand on the dusty roadsides. As for their regular lives, they either indulge in dance halls, or are addicted to opium, or gamble wildly and drink heavily, or engage in prostitution, turning day into night, becoming muddled and delirious, indulging in extreme luxury, and enjoying themselves to the fullest. Compared to the majority who are trapped in the tragic situation of hunger and cold, one works hard while the other enjoys leisure, one suffers while the other enjoys pleasure. One sells their blood and sweat but still cannot make a living, while the other lives in ease and luxury. A single banquet can provide a poor person with food for a year. "Behind vermillion gates, the smell of wine and meat; on the road, there are bones frozen to death." Under this comparison, it is no different from one place being paradise and the other being hell. Those in paradise use the blood and sweat of the working masses as wine and meat before singing and dancing, unaware that there is such a thing as suffering in the world. Is there anything more unjust than this in the world? When things are not fair, they will cry out; when they cannot live, they will take risks. Since it is already unfair and they cannot live, how can you prevent them from taking risks?</p>
<p>We believe that the existence of such extreme inequality in the world is a disgrace to humanity. We believe that the great misfortune of our country today is not the spread of the Communist Party's power, but this soil of inequality. This soil of inequality is not only a crisis for our society but also a crisis for the world. How to eliminate this phenomenon of inequality and how to resolve this crisis are major problems that must be addressed. However, solving this major problem is clearly beyond the power of guns and cannons. Lao Tzu said, "The people do not fear death, why threaten them with death?" Those with foresight should deeply understand these words.</p>
<p>Domestic Urgent Telegrams</p>

<p>First Conduct Informal Consultations, Then Written Negotiations</p>
<p>Also Telegraphed Instructions to the Delegation in Russia Regarding the Direction of the Process</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to external news, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs telegraphed Mo Teh-hui, who is staying in Italy, to return to the Russian capital as soon as possible to exchange views with the Soviet Russian foreign authorities on restoring diplomatic relations. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs also telegraphed the personnel of the delegation in Russia, instructing them on the direction of the restoration of diplomatic relations and to handle the matter carefully together with Representative Mo. It is heard that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs intends for Representative Mo to first conduct informal consultations with the Russian side on this matter, and then conduct written negotiations after there is progress. (10th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e4">Shen Jinding Discusses Recent Diplomacy <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs received reporters on the 10th, and Asian Affairs Director Shen Jinding met them. The reporters inquired about recent diplomacy, and he answered them one by one. (1) Regarding the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, after detailed consideration and consultation, the central government has decided on a plan. It is proposed to first sign a treaty of non-aggression. China is a peace-loving country and is particularly eager to contribute to world peace. However, it is willing to sign any treaties that can effectively guarantee the peace of both countries and other countries, including the League of Nations Covenant and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Even if Japan can abandon its policy of aggression, it can also sign a treaty. The Sino-Russian non-aggression treaty can effectively guarantee the League of Nations Covenant and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. This is the fundamental reason for wanting to sign the treaty. It is definitely not because the situation of the Sino-Eastern Railway necessitates the signing of the treaty. The diplomatic authorities have repeatedly stated that restoring diplomatic relations and aligning with Russia and tolerating communism are definitely not the same thing. The public opinion has also long had a deep understanding of this. Mo Teh-hui is currently recuperating in Italy and should be able to return to Russia to make contact. It has not yet been decided whether Mo will serve as the representative in future negotiations or whether someone else will be sent. The Russian side's attitude is currently unknown, but judging from past precedents, the restoration of diplomatic relations is expected. (2) The Japanese side is enthusiastically promoting the round table conference. Saito summoned the four ambassadors of Britain, the United States, France, and Italy to discuss. The Japanese side claims that the ambassadors have responded to the Yoshizawa proposal and expressed the attitudes of their respective countries. According to personal observation, this is purely one-sided propaganda from the Japanese side. All countries believe that there is no need to convene a round table conference specifically to discuss Shanghai's security. (3) The League of Nations General Assembly is scheduled to be held in September to discuss the Lytton Report. Gu Weijun is the founder of the League of Nations. This time, he accompanied the delegation out of the customs to investigate everything, and the truth is very clear. If he can go to attend the meeting, all parties will definitely make contributions. There are rumors that the central government intends to send Gu as the ambassador to France and also serve as the attending representative. The Foreign Minister Luo strongly advocates this, but it has not been completely decided yet. (4) Lytton is going to Qingdao to inspect the location for preparing the report. Because Japan insists on Dalian and we insist on Beidaihe, a compromise will be taken in the future. It is also possible to be in Qingdao. It can be decided after Lytton's inspection. Gu will go to Shanghai from Qingdao to Beijing to report in detail on the investigation after Lytton returns to Ping. The central government will discuss it in detail and make a decision. (5) Japan plans to set up a supreme administrative official in the Northeast, which is the same as the steps taken to annex Korea. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will have a serious response depending on how it proceeds. (6) The issue of the non-withdrawal of the Japanese Marine Corps in Shanghai is currently being negotiated. This is a matter of time and they will definitely be withdrawn. (10th)</p>

<p>Believing that there is Absolutely No Room for Mediation</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Central Committee members remaining in Shanghai telegraphed the Political Council twice, mediating the naval conflict and advising against using force against Qiongya. The Political Council replied on the 9th, believing that Chen Ce's actions in Qiongya and his disobedience were already obvious, and there was absolutely no room for mediation. The Southwest government, for the sake of maintaining its prestige, will have no choice but to resolve it with the most effective method if Chen Ce still does not realize his mistake. In recent days, Zhong Tianxin has been running around to mediate, but has not received a reply from the authorities. (10th Special Telegram)</p>

<p>(Qingdao) At 9:00 AM on the 10th, the investigation team inspected seaside houses in Qingdao. Lytton, Sydney, Macauiti, Gu Weijun, and Yoshida all went along. First, they inspected No. 2 Zhan Shan Road for a long time, then went to No. 3 Seaside Road. Because the wind and waves were too strong and the fog was heavy, they went to the new buildings near the Yamato Hotel. Finally, Yoshida led them to the residence of the Japanese Mine Village on Shuiping Road. Yoshida also carried a map to show Lytton that the arrangement here was appropriate. Lytton did not express any opinion after the inspection. Then, he went to the Sanatorium on Jinkou First Road with Sydney and others to rest. Around 12:00, Lytton and others attended a banquet hosted by Shen Honglie. At 2:00 PM, they visited Laoshan and left Qingdao around 6:00 PM on the evening of the 10th for Jinan.

<p>(Qingdao) Yoshida, the Japanese representative who came to Qingdao with Lord Lytton, answered reporters' questions at the Japanese Consulate General at 11:00 AM today, saying that because Beidaihe lacks water and electricity, there is no other promising place other than Qingdao. Qingdao is a good place, and the houses have also been inspected. The mayor's official residence felt small, but a quieter and more beautiful house owned by HSBC has been found. However, whether it will be in Qingdao or not must be discussed with the other committee members after returning to Ping before a decision can be made. If Qingdao is decided, the staff of the secretariat will come here immediately. Some committee members are also scheduled to visit Japan, and they are expected to come to Qingdao in late July. Foreigners thought that Fengtian was on the coast when the Japanese army entered Fengtian on September 18th last year, but when they learned that it was in the interior, they were very surprised that the Japanese army had actually gone to the interior. Because they had no prior knowledge of the situation in Manchuria and the relationship between China and Japan, it was difficult to make them understand for a while. It was very meaningful that the investigation team came here at that time. When they entered Manchuria from the Chinese mainland and went to the Chinese mainland from Manchuria, their thinking had changed greatly. As for the theory of entrusting the administration of Manchuria, it is really not a problem. Even in both China and Japan, it is not considered good. Who would entrust it? Manchuria is not the territory of the League of Nations. It is very harsh to say that Lord Lytton hoped to meet with Ma Zhanshan and criticize him. When the investigation team returns to the League of Nations, they worry that they will be accused of being unfair if they meet with the government of Manchukuo but not with the opposition. However, after careful consideration, the Manchurian issue concerns the two major countries of China and Japan, and secondly, Zhang Xueliang, who previously controlled Manchuria, and the government of Manchukuo. That is enough. If they were to meet with a bandit leader under him, they would know that there is no basis. Therefore, the meeting with Ma Zhanshan was stopped. When the investigation team first arrived in Japan, they made this statement (the result of the on-site investigation (preparing the report, first informing China and Japan, and then making a satisfactory report to both parties). But this is ideal, and in reality, it is nothing more than the investigation team's own opinion. What will happen in the end? Unless it is known in the minds of the five committee members, it is difficult to know clearly. In fact, it is impossible to implement unless it can be implemented. The report must be submitted to the Council on the first Sunday of September, and then reviewed by the Council. (10th Telegraphic News Agency)</p>

A train loaded with military supplies departed from here this morning, followed closely by an armored car for protection. There were no obstacles along the way to Yimianpo. As they continued to advance to the vicinity of the Wujimi River, about 600 anti-Manchu troops suddenly launched a fierce attack on the train loaded with military supplies. At that time, the Japanese armored car was lagging behind, so the train loaded with military supplies was in extreme danger. Then the armored car arrived and returned fire with machine guns and rifles. After several hours of fierce fighting, the Chinese army retreated. If the Chinese army had any cannons, they would have been able to destroy the train loaded with military supplies.

<p>(Nanjing) Wang Jingwei replied to a reporter from a certain agency, saying that the trip to Shanghai to retain Chen and Song was satisfactory. Song has agreed to withdraw his resignation and will return to Nanjing to resume his duties in the near future. Preliminary discussions have also been held regarding the reorganization of finances. Chen's reasons for resigning were twofold: first, he felt that it was difficult to handle affairs, and second, his health was declining and he intended to take a long-term rest. After Wang sincerely persuaded and retained him, Chen agreed to withdraw his resignation, but he needs to rest for several days before returning to Nanjing. Therefore, the Executive Yuan will approve his leave for recuperation, and the duties of the Minister will be temporarily handled by the Vice Minister. Furthermore, Chu Minyi stated that Song's resignation was due to financial difficulties. During Wang's trip to Shanghai, in addition to sincerely retaining him, he also had preliminary discussions on the financial aftermath. However, the matter is significant and cannot be decided at once. Specific measures will need to be discussed at length after Song returns to Nanjing before a decision can be made.

<p>Hoping to Gain French Approval</p>
<p>Geneva, 10th, National News Agency - Experts from various countries attending the Disarmament Conference here heard that the London newspaper carried a statement by British Prime Minister MacDonald proposing to stop the arms race for a long period of time and laughed it off as a wild guess, believing that the act of stopping the arms race is extremely impractical. It is also said that some representatives have received definite news that MacDonald has prepared a practical plan to reduce armaments in nature and will bring it to Geneva in the near future. His visit to Paris is to hope to obtain the approval of Herriot.</p>

<p>London, 9th, National News Agency - Today's Daily Mail reports that if the plenary session of the Disarmament Conference next Tuesday fails to agree on a disarmament policy, British Prime Minister MacDonald will propose stopping the arms race for ten, twelve, or fifteen years. It is reported that MacDonald will discuss this proposal with French Prime Minister Herriot, hoping to achieve a unified Anglo-French position.</p>

British Prime Minister MacDonald will arrive in Paris with Foreign Secretary Simon at 5:30 p.m. on Saturday and immediately meet with French Prime Minister Herriot. On Sunday morning, they will hold further consultations, likely talking all day, and on Monday morning, the British executive will set off again for Geneva.

<p>Geneva, 9th, National News Agency - Since the report of the Air Force Committee was completed, the technical committees of the Disarmament Conference have completed their work, gaining a kind of disagreement agreement, that is, everyone says that they cannot agree on what is being discussed. The current problem facing the conference is how to proceed after the technical discussions have all yielded negative results. The leaders of the conference will meet next Tuesday and may decide to convene a general committee with representatives from various countries. The general committee may temporarily wait and see until the Lausanne Conference has yielded results. Therefore, the general public here believes that the fate of the Disarmament Conference will also depend on the Lausanne Conference. If the Lausanne Conference fails, the future of the Disarmament Conference will become even bleaker and may be adjourned indefinitely at the end of this month. Conversely, if the Lausanne Conference succeeds, it may break the technical deadlock of the Disarmament Conference and continue to discuss the basic political issues of disarmament.</p>

<p>Santiago, Chile, 9th, National News Agency - Chile's external disputes have increased today.

The new government now insists that all foreign banks and businesses must use Chilean currency for calculations, and the original amount of foreign currency should be converted at the current exchange rate. It is said that this measure is to prevent the devaluation of the Chilean currency.</p>

<p>An Extraordinary Diet Will Be Convened Within Two Months</p>
<p>Saito Meets with Seiyukai President</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th, Denstu - The government decided at today's cabinet meeting to convene the third extraordinary Diet session since this year within two months in order to determine rural relief measures. As a result of discussions on fundamental measures to relieve rural areas, it was decided to oppose matters with the meaning of lowering prices and will not be adopted. Takahashi, Mitsuchi, and Hatoyama, the three cabinet members from the Seiyukai faction, have expressed their agreement.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th, Denstu - Prime Minister Saito met with Seiyukai President Suzuki at 1:00 p.m. today in the reception room of the House of Peers. As a result of the discussion on the issue of price reduction, no decision was reached, and they dispersed without reaching a consensus.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th, Denstu - After Prime Minister Saito met with Seiyukai President Suzuki at the House of Peers, in order to determine the government's attitude on the issue of price reduction, an extraordinary cabinet meeting was held in the House at 2:00 p.m. After a decision is made, he will reply to President Suzuki today. The government seems to have decided to oppose price reduction in fact.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th, Denstu - At the extraordinary cabinet meeting, Minister of Education Hatoyama, representing Prime Minister Saito, visited Seiyukai President Suzuki and explained the contents of the cabinet meeting. He requested revisions to (1) the amendment of the Currency Act to make the currency circulation satisfactory, and (2) the extraordinary Diet session within two months to be changed to as soon as possible. Suzuki replied that he would need to discuss and decide with the party executives. President Suzuki made it clear that he himself does not oppose it, so the government and the Seiyukai are expected to reach a compromise on the price reduction plan.</p>

However, they decided to oppose the price reduction based on the amendment of the Currency Act. The cabinet members from the Seiyukai faction also agreed. Prime Minister Saito dispatched Minister of Education Hatoyama to inform Seiyukai President Suzuki of the results.</p>
<p>League of Nations Gold Committee</p>
<h3 id="e81">Publishes Final Report <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Recognizes Gold Standard as Best Monetary System</p>
<p>Geneva, 9th, Reuters - The Gold Committee organized by the League of Nations in 1929 has published its final report. It is stated that the gold standard is still the best currency mechanism currently available. The gold standard can achieve almost all the benefits that other standards can boast of. Regardless of the distribution of gold, all the gold reserves in the world are sufficient to support the credit structure. The decline in prices in recent years is not due to a lack of gold supply.</p>
<p>Raising prices is indeed necessary, but this matter depends not only on currency policy. National banks should encourage greater freedom in lending and reduce the ratio of recognized reserves. However, in addition to this majority report, there is also a report signed by a minority of committee members. The signatories are Committee Chairman Zhang Xun and all the British committee members. The minority report states that the main reason for the collapse of the gold standard was the improper measures taken for gold reserves since 1929. However, both reports agree on practical remedies, believing that international debt should be resolved as soon as possible and restrictions on international trade should be reduced.</p>

<p>clearly mentioning what he called the "Republic and Constitutional Monarchy" question.</p>
<p>Geer claimed that there were rumors that the constitution would be amended,</p>

Our obligation lies in saving the country. I have no intention of raising the issue of the form of government again and causing the people to feel uneasy. I hope the world trusts my sincerity and my oath to uphold the constitution before the President. Other cabinet members and the Prime Minister should not express their personal opinions on this matter due to their positions. Other than that, their thoughts should be completely in line with mine.</p>

<p>Federal Reserve's Ability Limited</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 9th – In the past week, cash withdrawals for transfer abroad totaled $13,200,000, a new record for this year. Most of this cash was shipped to France and Switzerland. The US gold reserve currently stands at approximately $4 billion, having decreased by $500 million this year. Foreign banks are believed to still hold approximately $30 million in cash in the United States, which is also expected to be gradually withdrawn. With the loss of this large amount of cash, the Federal Reserve's ability to expand lending within the legally mandated minimum gold reserve coverage has been limited. It is reported that the Fed, influenced by the cash outflow, has decided to halt its policy of purchasing large quantities of US government bonds. The Fed has spent a total of $600 million on this policy, but the results have been disappointing, as banks affiliated with the reserve system, with extremely scarce conservative reserves, are unwilling to release loans, so trade still shows no improvement.</p>

However, there were no buyers, so the London Stock Exchange has now suspended trading in these shares.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Paris, 9th – Former French Prime Minister Théodore Steeg, along with thirty political allies, today announced their departure from the Republican Left and the formation of the Republican Center Party. Members include former Finance Minister Louis Renault and former Minister of War Paul Painlevé. This move is the result of differing opinions within the Left Republican Party regarding the attitude towards the new cabinet. When the Chamber of Deputies voted on the new government's policy statement today, members of the party's left wing openly violated Steeg's wishes, either voting in favor or abstaining.</p>

<p>Havas News Agency, Berlin, 9th – The German army and navy, together with the Ministry of the Interior and local authorities, will hold exercises in East Prussia from June 23rd to 25th to protect civilians from aircraft attacks. The exercises will take place in Königsberg, Allenstein, and Friedland. Interior Minister Wilhelm von Gayl will personally participate. Federal military and civil authorities have very detailed plans for this matter. Observers believe that in recent months, the psychology of the people in the border area between Germany and Poland has been extremely tense, and the defense exercises are being held at this time in a place closest to the Polish border. Whether this is appropriate, given the situation, is highly questionable.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Cairo, 10th – According to reports from Addis Ababa, Abyssinia has declared national martial law because former King Iyasu V, disguised as a woman, escaped from his place of confinement to the mountains of Gojjam Province, where he gathered a large number of people and is plotting to overthrow the current Emperor. Iyasu V is the grandson of Menelik II, a famous wise king of Abyssinia. In 1916, he was suspected of sympathizing with Germany and was forced to abdicate under pressure from the Entente powers. He was only twenty years old at the time and was subsequently confined to a monastery by the current Emperor, under the supervision of Prince Kassa, a close relative. Prince Kassa has now been arrested as a result and may face death.</p>

<p>League of Nations Investigation Team</p>
<h3 id="e97">Compiling Report Location <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Decision to be Made After Lytton and Others Inspect Qingdao</p>
<p>Japanese Side Opposes Beidaihe, with Hidden Intentions</p>
<p>Beijing Correspondence – The League of Nations investigation team held a routine meeting at the Beijing Hotel at 10:00 AM on the 7th to discuss everything. Around 10:00 AM, Secretary-General Haas and Secretary Wu Xiufeng went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to begin sorting out documents. Regarding the location for writing the report, there was originally a proposal for Beidaihe. The Japanese side strongly opposed this, advocating for Qingdao or Xingpu in Dalian. The investigation team had no preconceived notions regarding the location, only that it should be quiet, cool, and suitable for work. To accommodate the Japanese request, it was decided to visit Qingdao for inspection before making a final decision. On the 7th, the team had already decided that Chairman Lytton would travel with the German representative Schnee, the Italian representative Marescotti, and one attendant. The remaining French representative Claudel, US representative McCoy, Secretary-General Haas, and other attendants would remain in Beijing to sort out the materials collected during the investigation. The Chinese side will be represented by Gu Weijun and attendants Liu Chongjie and Xiao Jirong, totaling three or four people. The Japanese side will be represented by Yoshida, Secretary Shiozaki, Colonel Kubota, and attendant Hayashi, departing from Beijing on the 8th at 6:00 PM after the Pingpu Railway resumes service, using three special cars. After arriving in Jinan, they will transfer to the Jiaoji Railway to Qingdao. It is reported that Lytton and others will only make a one-day inspection in Qingdao and return to Beijing on Friday. Gu Weijun plans to travel to Nanjing from Qingdao to report on the inspection of the Northeast and seek instructions on the future course of action.</p>
<p>Although Qingdao is located by the sea and the scenery is no less beautiful than Beidaihe, as a commercial port, the city is noisy, and with factories lining the streets and smoke billowing, it is far less quiet and suitable for work than Beidaihe. It is likely that Beidaihe will still be the main location in the future. On the 8th, after the routine meeting at 10:00 AM, the members of the investigation team went to their respective embassies for consultations. In the afternoon at 3:00 PM, the German representative visited the Summer Palace, while the French and Italian representatives visited the Temple of Heaven.</p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding the location for the investigation team to escape the heat and compile the report, according to informed sources, the final location for compiling the report is likely to be Qingdao. Initially, it was determined to be Beidaihe, but the Japanese side opposed this and advocated for Dalian, citing the reason that Beidaihe is under the sphere of influence of a certain party. However, the underlying reason is actually because Beidaihe is close to Shanhaiguan. Before the investigation team returned to Shenyang from northern Manchuria, the Japanese army in Yuguan frequently conducted exercises and provocative actions, and the situation was extremely dangerous for a time. When the investigation team passed through Yuguan, the Japanese side made every effort to conceal the situation to prevent them from discovering it. If the investigation team were to reside by the sea in the future, the actions of the Japanese army in Yuguan would be difficult to escape their eyes and ears. Moreover, residing by the sea for at least a month is a considerable amount of time, which is especially disliked by the Japanese side. However, the investigation team not only did not agree to Dalian, but also rejected the Japanese side's proposed Xingpu area between Dalian. Japan finally proposed Qingdao, and the team also favored this place. After touring Beidaihe, they stated that they intended to tour several more places before making a decision, but this was just to leave room for detailed consideration. Now that they are only going to Qingdao, there seems to be a kind of decision implicitly, and there is little doubt that the report will be drafted in Qingdao in the future. As for what the investigation team calls "inspection," it is probably just a kind of disguise to make both the Chinese and Japanese sides look good. (8th)</p>

<h3 id="e98">Atrocities in Heihe <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Expanding Puppet Troops to Attack Righteous Army</p>
<p>Cheng's Defection Led to Brutal Harm</p>
<p>Sad Winds and Bitter Rain Fill Jiangcheng</p>
<p>Beijing Correspondence – According to people from Heihe, since Ma Zhanshan expressed his attitude, patriots and volunteer armies in various places have responded one after another. Li Haiqing led 20,000 volunteer soldiers on May 14th from Fuyu County, crossing the river to Qiqihar and the western section of the Chinese Eastern Railway line. The Japanese 15th Brigade, led by Amano, dispatched Cheng Zhiyuan's 8th Brigade, 54th Regiment, led by Regiment Commander Tu Quansheng, to resist. Cheng believed that attacking anti-Japanese elements everywhere would not be successful without adding troops. Amano, considering that Cheng was exceptionally devoted to the puppet state, was quite amenable to his suggestion and requested instructions from Honjo Shigeru. Honjo approved Cheng's temporary formation of two cavalry brigades. All clothing, arms, and ammunition were to be allocated by Liaoning. The Japanese side, fearing future disadvantages, ordered the recruitment of bandits, with officers jointly appointed by China and Japan. Honjo urgently telegraphed the Tokyo government, ordering all students from the Army University to come to Manchuria to await assignments. The president of the Army University, Ushijima, led all 58 students to Qiqihar on May 18th. Although Cheng Zhiyuan actively recruited new soldiers, no one responded. He again sent people to recruit bandits from various places, but only formed two regiments, which were combined with Tu Quansheng's 54th Regiment to form a brigade. At that time, Li</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>Haiqing had occupied the Zhaodong area. The Japanese side appointed Tu Quansheng as the commander of the 2nd Cavalry Brigade and overall commander, with Zhu Fengyang's 55th Regiment of the 8th Brigade as support. Amano dispatched the 16th Regiment as a support team, and they advanced towards Zhaozhou. When the two armies faced off, soldiers on both sides fired into the air. After being threatened by Tu's collaborators and Japanese vehicles, Li Haiqing's soldiers shouted, "Japanese advance, Chinese retreat!", shaking the heavens and the earth. Tu and Zhu's regiments defected one after another. The Japanese army immediately launched fierce artillery fire and aircraft dropped bombs, causing an unprecedented fire in the Machang area of Zhaozhou County. Tu's accomplice had his right ring and little fingers completely blown off by Li's army artillery fire, and his left foot was blasted into a hole, rendering him disabled. He is currently recovering from his injuries in the provincial government hospital. Zhu's accomplice barely escaped with his life. As a result, Anda, Tiangegang, Duingshan, and Lanxi all fell within Li's army's area of influence. The Japanese side, realizing that Chinese-recruited bandits could not be effectively commanded, and that Japanese leadership would be even more unacceptable, sent the incoming Army University students back to Japan. On the 20th, the Cheng Zhiyuan guard machine gun company stationed at the Wufuma station on the Qi'ang Railway (18 li from the provincial capital) completely defected, responding to Li's army. The provincial capital was filled with rumors, and there were several alarms in one night. The Japanese army and Cheng's forces dispatched numerous detectives to investigate everywhere, arresting an uncountable number of people, falsely accusing and unjustly killing them. It is almost impossible to enumerate. After Cheng's treacherous killing of Ma Zhanshan's representative Wang Tinglan, he recently informed the Japanese military police on May 19th that Dai Shuqing, the office director of Ma Zhanshan's 3rd Cavalry Brigade stationed in Heihe, was secretly communicating with Chairman Ma, requesting their prompt arrest. The Japanese military police then arrested Dai and a driver surnamed Man, along with a wicker bag of documents. After interrogation, Man was released on bail. Dai was subjected to numerous severe tortures but ultimately did not confess. On the night of May 28th at 8:00 PM, the Japanese military police captain, Kaimura, suddenly summoned Dai, ordering him to write hundreds of characters in regular script. He was then imprisoned in a confinement room. At 1:00 AM that night, Dai was summoned again and his whereabouts became unknown. Two days later,</p>
<p>When Dai's servant went to inquire, the Japanese military police stated that he had been released on the 28th. On May 30th, Cheng Zhiyuan shot and killed two more officers from Ma's army, one being Wen Junfu, who served as the lieutenant colonel battalion commander in Deng's regiment (i.e., Deng Wen) under Chairman Ma, and the other being Liu Xiufeng, who served as the major company commander in the same battalion. They were ordered to go to the Yian County area. Wen and Liu remained composed, delivering impassioned speeches that were lamented by many. After the execution, the heavens and the earth took on a sorrowful appearance. Currently, the troops in Heilongjiang province who have submitted to Cheng include Xu Baozhen's brigade stationed in Sandaozhen, Baiquan County, Tu Quansheng's brigade stationed in the provincial capital, Pu BingShan's brigade stationed in Baiquan, and Cheng Zhiyuan's own 8th Brigade stationed in Taianzhen, up to the Daxing station area. The railway protection troops who have surrendered to Ma include Wu Songlin's brigade, Zhang Xiangge's brigade, Su Bingwen's brigade, and the volunteer army led by Li Haiqing, totaling about 45,000 people. Ma's troops have now retreated to Tongbei County, and Cai Hongyou has retreated to Qingcheng. Recently, rumors have spread throughout the provincial capital, and Cheng has intensified the search and arrest of anti-Japanese elements. The current situation in Heihe is almost one of sad winds and bitter rain filling Jiangcheng. Cheng Zhiyuan's troops, according to the Manchurian puppet army system, have three regiments per brigade, each regiment has three major companies, and each platoon has a fixed number of 18 people. The organization is now complete. The Japanese side, in order to raise funds, plans to establish an opium monopoly bureau, so poppies have been planted everywhere in Heilongjiang Province.</p>

<h3 id="e99">Leads Troops to Flee to Hebei <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Han Sends Zhang and Chen's Brigades to Pursue</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence - Liu Guitang (i.e., Liu Hei Qi)'s troops have long harassed southern Shandong, being the biggest scourge of Shandong. In 1928, when the National Revolutionary Army was on the Northern Expedition, Liu was commissioned as an army commander and participated in the battles. After the National Revolutionary Army recovered Shandong, Liu was stationed in the eastern Shandong area. Before long, he was ordered to transfer to Henan. Along the way, he extorted weapons from local militias and forcibly demanded loans, causing unbearable harassment to the people. The brigade was reorganized into the Northeastern Army's newly编旅, stationed in Daming, but still failed to abide by military discipline, harassing the local population. The central government then sent the 4th Division, led by Xu Tingyao, last year to resolve the situation. Liu again led his troops to break through the encirclement and fled into western Shandong, crossing the Yellow River from Feicheng Dawenkou, and returned to southern Shandong and eastern Shandong, capturing Rizhao, taking Zhucheng, and returning to his old nest in Feixian. Recently, through the introduction of Zhang Futian, he was incorporated by Han Fuju, with a total of over 3,000 troops and over 2,000 rifles. He was transferred to the Gaotang Yaodian area on the north bank of the Yellow River. After inspection and verification, he was reorganized into the Shandong Garrison Army, with Han himself serving as the commander-in-chief, Liu Guitang as the deputy commander and commander of the first route, and Guo Mafeng as the commander of the second route. The military pay and treatment were the same as those of the third route. Unexpectedly, Liu still considered it insufficient and continued to extort money from the local population. During this recent bandit suppression in northern Shandong, Liu was alarmed and drove away the county magistrate, and surrounded and disarmed the local militia. Upon receiving the report, Han immediately sent troops to surround them. Liu and Guo then led their troops to flee into Hebei province at 2:00 AM on the 8th, intending to go to northern Henan. The army is currently pursuing them. A detailed account of the situation is given below.</p>
<p>Bandit Uprising - Liu Guitang, seeing that the provincial army was successively being transferred to northern Shandong in large numbers, fearing that it would be detrimental to him, decided to strike first. On the morning of the 6th, he first sent troops to surround the Gaotang Public Security Bureau, forcing them to surrender their weapons. County Magistrate Zhang Kebao was driven out, and the city gates were tightly closed, leaving only two gates open to send off the families of the bandits. The people of Gaotang were extremely frightened and fled the city, supporting the old and carrying the young. The training officers and other personnel sent by the provincial government to Liu's troops were not harmed, but were disarmed and expelled. The office established by Liu at Wancheng Railway Station had over twenty cavalrymen. They were transferred back to Gaotang one night. Guo Mafeng led a portion of his troops to garrison Yaodian, and also gathered in Gaotang on the morning of the 7th, but did not enter the city, garrisoning the city corner to take a 角之勢.</p>
<p>Large-Scale Encirclement - Sun Tongxuan, the temporary commander-in-chief of the bandit suppression in northern Shandong, received an alarm about the Gaotang incident. He reported to the provincial government on the one hand and ordered the 85th Brigade, led by Li Hanzhang, stationed in Dezhou, to advance westward, and the 86th Brigade, led by Chen Dexin, stationed in Dongchang, to advance northeastward. Zhao Renquan's northern Shandong militia command was stationed in Linqing, responsible for the northern front, and the 58th Brigade, led by Zhang Shulin, stationed in Pingyuan,</p>
<p>Was on the eastern front, forming a large-scale encirclement of Gaotang and Yaodian. Commander-in-Chief Sun Tongxuan was stationed in Pingyuan, commanding everything. Li Shuchun, after inspecting Pingyuan, Dezhou, Yucheng, and Enxian, also arrived in Pingyuan to assist in the suppression. Chairman Han, because Gaotang was only 75 li from Yucheng Railway Station, fearing that the bandits would attack Yucheng Station and disrupt traffic, also sent the hand pistol brigade commander Lei Taiping, leading the special service battalion to garrison Yucheng to prevent any eventuality. Liu Guitang's office in Yucheng was disbanded by the armored car commander Dai Hongbin on the morning of the 6th. The office in Jinan was also disbanded by the garrison command. Office director Xu Peiyan fled upon hearing the news.</p>
<p>Nightly Alert - Currently, armored car commander Dai Hongbin leads the Beiping armored car on nightly patrol between Dezhou and Zhangzhuang. The 58th Brigade is on the front line, advancing westward from Pingyuan. The 20th Division's artillery unit also advanced from Pingyuan. Two companies of the 20th Division's cavalry advanced from Yucheng at 9:00 PM on the 6th, only 30 to 40 li from Gaotang. Yucheng, because it is closer to Gaotang, is under even stricter alert. At 6:00 PM in the afternoon, the city gates were closed, and the Taishan armored car, with two companies of special service soldiers, patrolled between Gaotang and Yucheng. The remaining two companies garrisoned Yucheng, and the night inspections were strict, with frequent password changes. The troops all bivouacked in the open.</p>
<p>Bandits Flee to Hebei - With the deployment of the various units completed, they advanced forward on the 7th. Liu Guitang and Guo Mafeng, seeing that the Gaotang city wall was low and the moat shallow, and unable to hold out, led their troops out of the west gate at 2:00 AM on the 8th and fled into Hebei province. Their purpose was to flee through Hebei province to Henan. One theory is that they intended to defect to Sun Dianying. Because the Gaotang Tongji long-distance telephone line was destroyed by them, the various parties received the report extremely late. Lei Taiping, after the bandits fled, returned to Jinan at 2:30 PM in the afternoon with the special service battalion on an armored car to report to Chairman Han Fuju.</p>
<p>Han Fuju Speaks - Provincial government chairman Han Fuju spoke about the incident, saying that Liu's troops fled southwest, apparently intending to flee to northern Henan. He had already ordered 58th Brigade Commander Zhang Shulin and 86th Brigade Commander Chen Dexin to track and pursue them, but the bandits were moving very quickly, and it was unknown whether they could catch up. Division Commander Sun and Commissioner Li had already arrived in Gaotang to handle the aftermath. It was not yet known what the losses were in Gaotang, and a report had not yet been received. He had also telegraphed</p>
<p>The troops stationed in northern Henan to jointly suppress them. It was also heard that Sun Tongxuan and Li Shuchun had already driven to Qingping to command the various armies to pursue the bandits. The Beiping armored car had already left Pingyuan and was waiting in Yucheng for orders.</p>
<p>Zhang's Bandits Flee, Southern Shandong Bandits Request Surrender - Over 1,000 troops of Zhang Heilian, Wang Changyou, and other notorious bandits in southern Shandong requested to surrender. Han Fuju sent Xia Ziming and Meng Guangshan to negotiate. Zhang, Wang, and others gathered at the Nanshahe Railway Station, outside the north gate on the 7th at 9:00 PM, planning to open and station in Yucheng.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, upon arriving at Liangxiadian Railway Station south of Zou County, they received news of the solution of Liu Guitang and Guo Mafeng's troops. They immediately got off the train and fled, one part fleeing to the southwest of the railway in the Yanghu area, and the other part fleeing to the east of the railway back to their old nest. However, the government had made preparations in advance, so the 22nd Division Commander Gu Liangmin</p>
<p>Was responsible for pursuing those west of the railway, and the 81st Division Tang Bangzhi's brigade and the southern Shandong militia Xie Shushi's troops were responsible for pursuing those east of the railway, striving to take advantage of their fatigue to suppress them and eliminate the scourge for the people.</p>
<p>Issuing Complications - As for the personnel from Liu Guitang's office in Jinan and the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army who were arrested in recent days, from Liu Guitang's side, a total of over 30 people were arrested in Jinan, and over 40 people were arrested in Yucheng and escorted to Jinan, including over ten women. On the afternoon of the 8th, Han Fuju interrogated them and immediately released over twenty innocent suspects. The over ten women were also ordered to be taken back by their families after it was confirmed that they were good people. As for the remaining prisoners, they were temporarily detained. Also, there was a son of Xia Ziming, whom Han told that there was no danger and that he did not need to be afraid, but that he would temporarily be handed over to Public Security Bureau Chief Wang Kairu for preferential detention to prevent contact with the outside. Also, one army commander, division commanders, brigade commanders, and quartermasters of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army, totaling over ten people, all confessed that they were appointed by Fu Cunhuai and others from Yan Xishan's side. Han then ordered them to be temporarily detained for investigation before interrogation. (8th)</p>

<p>Relief for Disaster Victims: Building Memorial Villages The Shanghai Municipal Local Maintenance Association, in response to the destruction of 2,618 houses in this county by the Japanese army, and the resulting destitution and temporary shelter arrangements of many disaster victims, has allocated 35,000 yuan specifically for the construction of memorial villages in the affected areas, to provide housing for the disaster victims. On the 9th, Yang Weiyu was dispatched to Jiading to meet with the county's relief sub-committee to discuss implementation measures. It was agreed that construction sites would be located in Lou Tang, Zhujia Bridge, outside the North Gate, outside the East Gate, Kejing, Xiaoma Bridge, and other places. It is estimated that approximately 230 rooms will be built, costing 27,600 yuan, with the remaining funds used for public facilities. However, due to the large number of disaster-stricken households, only a portion can be sheltered.</p>

<p>Continuous Occurrence of Robbery Cases in Urban and Rural Areas In Wuxi, within the recent half-month, in addition to the continuous occurrence of rice looting incidents in the four rural districts, murder and robbery cases have also occurred almost daily. On the 1st of last month, two more cases occurred, as described below: (1) At the Yi Sheng Chun timber business located at Gengdu Bridge outside the South Gate, five robbers suddenly arrived at 9:00 PM on the 9th, carrying four pistols. One of the robbers, acting as the leader, entered the accounting room directly, declaring, "We have five boats passing through your area and need 400 yuan to boost our morale." While he spoke, another robber climbed upstairs and cut the electric light wires, commencing a thorough search and robbery, lasting half an hour before leaving with the loot. The result was the robbery of approximately one hundred yuan in silver coins and paper money, as well as a large quantity of clothing. (2) In the Chao Yin Qing Zhou Pi Jiang Ba area of the Second District, residents Zhou Hongsheng, Hongshun, and Hongmao, three brothers, lived together in one house, occupying the upper and lower floors. They typically farmed and also worked as rice boatmen, and had therefore accumulated some savings. At 12:00 AM the previous night, more than ten robbers suddenly broke into the house, splitting up to search the three households. When they arrived at Hongsheng's room, Hongsheng, recently having planned for self-defense, had prepared a rifle and a pistol, both with permits. One robber first grabbed the pistol from beside his pillow, along with seven bullets, jumped onto the table, and directed the other robbers in their search. He also took out an account book from his pocket and flipped through the pages. Hongsheng, curled up in a corner of the room, secretly observed that nearly thirty households in the entire village with some wealth were listed in the account book. After an hour, they left with the loot towards Qianqiao. Before leaving, they fired shots continuously as a show of force. After inspection, the three households had lost more than one thousand yuan in total, and Hongmao's wife, Wu, was also severely injured with a sharp blade.</p>
<p>The Seventh District Resolves to Provide Relief and Self-Defense Zhao Yingqiu, the head of the Seventh District, recently convened the township heads due to the continuous occurrence of rice looting incidents in the district. Unscrupulous elements have taken the opportunity to become active, and public safety in the rural areas is in imminent danger. He convened the township heads to organize a relief committee and resolved the following: (1) Relief for impoverished farmers will be divided into three categories: concessional loans, price stabilization, and porridge distribution. Village leaders and neighbors will conduct thorough investigations, allocating loans to the poorest, price-stabilized grain to the next poorest, and porridge to the most impoverished. (2) Relief funds will be raised by each township from wealthy residents, rich households, granaries, charitable estates, and wealthy gentlemen in other ports. (3) Each township will organize a temporary defense corps or watch post within a specified timeframe to assist existing self-defense organizations in protecting the local area.

<p>Fish Business Inspection Causes Great Disturbance Zhao Yuting, the Chief Inspector of the Public Security Bureau, reported on the evening of the 7th around 7:00 PM that someone was smoking opium at the Zengshun fish business west of Puhui Bridge outside the North Gate. Zhao led patrolmen to search the premises and found opium paraphernalia and seven suspected opium offenders: Yang Peisheng, Yang Duobao, Wang Shao Chen, Liu Chunfu, Wang Jiemin, Yu Zihong, and Lu Guanchun. The business's staff, believing that the patrolmen were plainclothes robbers, alerted the fishmongers and nearby villagers, who gathered to resist arrest, causing great disorder. Later, Magistrate Ma personally went to investigate and approved the release of the suspected opium offenders on bail by Town Head Wang Fanzhi, which brought the situation under control.</p>

<p>Silk Filature Taxes Have Been Approved for Exemption Due to various factors, silk merchants in Jiaxing are unwilling to establish filatures to purchase cocoons this silkworm season. The Silk Industry Association, to facilitate farmers' sale of cocoons, repeatedly urged silk merchants to raise funds to open filatures to purchase cocoons. However, due to economic reasons, less than one-tenth of the silk filatures in the county have opened. The association also requested the relevant ministries and provincial authorities to exempt all taxes and surcharges to alleviate the difficulties faced by the merchants due to poor silkworm harvests. It is now learned that the Ministry of Finance, after reviewing the request, believes that the situation presented is indeed factual and has instructed the Zhejiang Provincial Government to order the Departments of Finance and Construction to approve the exemption of silk filature taxes and surcharges for one year. The association has been notified accordingly.</p>

<p>Strike Picketers Seal Off Classrooms</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education Will Send Representatives to Mediate</p>
<p>Peiping, 10th The Joint Association of Schools and Colleges of Peiping University (平大) informed the press this morning that if Shen Yinmo does not resign, they are determined to use force to remove him. The Normal University went on strike this morning, and picketers sealed off all classrooms, declared martial law, and prohibited entry and exit, preparing to go to Beijing to demand the president's removal.</p>
<p>From Beijing sources In recent days, the Ministry of Education has received a deluge of telegrams from students of eight schools requesting the removal of presidents and deans. Considering that this matter has a significant impact on the future of education in Peiping and Tianjin, and that the authorities cannot shirk their responsibility if the storm unfortunately escalates, the Ministry of Education plans to send representatives to Peiping within days to mediate and investigate the cause of the incident in order to resolve it. Peiping, 10th Three thousand students from various schools and colleges of Peiping University plan to surround Peiping University on the 11th. After receiving the news, Yinmo telegraphed the Ministry of Education to resign and will not go to school from the 11th.</p>

<p>|Classes Suspended for One Day with One Month's Salary Paid</p>
<p>|Classes Resumed Normally on the 9th</p>
<p>The entire faculty of the Colleges of Engineering, Agriculture, Liberal Arts, and Sciences of Zhejiang University had been in arrears of salary for three months, with only payments up to the end of February made. In light of the increasing cost of living, they felt unable to maintain their livelihoods. Representatives from the Colleges of Engineering, Agriculture, and Liberal Arts had repeatedly urged the university to issue the arrears, but to no avail. Therefore, an emergency meeting of the entire faculty was convened, and it was resolved to take collective leave starting from the 8th. Consequently, all three colleges simultaneously suspended classes. President Cheng Tianfang was in Nanjing negotiating for funds. The university authorities, in addition to immediately telegraphing Cheng to return to Hangzhou as soon as possible, made every effort to raise funds. On the same evening, they issued one month's salary for March to the entire faculty of the three colleges, totaling over 40,000 yuan, requesting them to resume classes as usual. The entire faculty of the university also resumed classes on the 9th due to student academic concerns, thus resolving the collective leave-taking crisis.</p>

<p>Li Ximou, the Dean of the College of Engineering of Zhejiang University, has been in office since 1927, a period of five years. Last year, due to the petition of the College of Engineering's student volunteer army, which led to the destruction of the provincial party headquarters and the residence of Zhang Daofan, the magistrate of the education county, he once resigned to take responsibility. Unexpectedly, he has recently become dissatisfied with the students, who issued an anti-Li declaration. Li then submitted his resignation to Cheng Tianfang, the president of Zhejiang University, instructing the heads of departments to handle the handover. He has not been to school since the 8th, and his resignation is resolute, expressing that he is unwilling to return to office. The students of the college convened an emergency general meeting the night before last, unanimously resolving that there was no need to retain Li's resignation and deciding on the criteria for the new dean: (1) high moral character, (2) profound knowledge, (3) a respected figure in the industrial sector, (4) no political affiliations.</p>

<p>Concluding the University Department in Guangdong and Preparing for the Establishment of a Middle School Department</p>
<p>Returning to Shanghai in Two Weeks</p>
<p>National Jinan University has suffered enormous losses since the Shanghai Incident. President Zheng and all the faculty and staff have worked tirelessly and spared no effort to continue the school by borrowing temporary school buildings in Shanghai in the shortest possible time. On the one hand, it has established a university department in Guangzhou, and on the other hand, it has established a middle school department in Suzhou, so that students scattered throughout the country can continue their studies. Now that the school has undergone this war, it has decided to take the opportunity to improve the school. A post-war reorganization committee has been established a few days ago to conduct careful research on future reform plans. Recently, the school affairs meeting of the school decided that starting from the next semester, the middle school department will be established in Guangzhou, and the normal school department will be established separately in Suzhou, with an affiliated experimental school, which is specially designed for students who are interested in education in the department and various departments of the university department. As for the Zhenru school building, it will be completely used as the university department. The university department stationed in Guangdong will be revoked at the end of this semester and moved back to Zhenru. The principal of the school, in order to end the university department in Guangzhou and prepare for the establishment of a middle school department, will personally return to Guangdong to plan everything, and will take the Coolidge mail ship south today, and it is expected that he will stay there for two weeks.</p>

<p>Not Removing the Courtyard Grass</p>
<p>Twenty-one</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu was as strange as we were. He didn't ask us how much tuition we gave him each month, nor did he ask us how many hours of lessons we wanted him to teach each day. What was the reason for this? Could it be that he was a wealthy man who didn't want to fuss about salary and hours? Why weren't these salary and hour issues a problem in his mind? Could it be that he was so happy to have found a place where he could assert his own ideas that he forgot about these problems? Who knows? ···········</p>
<p>Two people carrying two loads gradually approached. Who? Wasn't that tall man Mr. Zhu? The smaller one must be his younger brother. The teacher himself was carrying bedding! This was the first time I had ever seen such a thing in my life. ······ Mr.! Why are you carrying your own luggage? This is exactly our opportunity to serve you. ······· Brother Chunsheng! You carry for the little brother, and I'll carry for the teacher, okay?” I volunteered. Brother Chunsheng ran up to snatch the teacher's larger luggage, and said to me, "You are younger, you should carry the smaller one."</p>
<p>Who knew that Mr. Shi was determined to carry his own bedding to the countryside. No matter what we said, he refused to let us carry it. His reason was quite simple. He said: "This is the first lesson I learned from you. Country people carry firewood into the city to sell, and we should follow their example." But how could we agree with him? He was our newly hired teacher. How could we just stand by with our hands empty and comfortably watch the teacher sweat? In the end, Old Madam Song proposed a compromise: the four of us would take turns carrying the two loads of luggage. However, when we got close to the ancient temple, we had to let Brother Chunsheng and Zhonger carry it. Old Madam Song's suggestion was accepted by both sides. After all, the teacher's shoulders were very tender, and the younger brother's were even more tender. When we got to the ancient temple and took off our clothes, we saw that our shoulders were as red as if we had been scratched, and two fleshy bumps had grown up. The younger brother said later that he felt particularly sore all night. He thought it was very interesting to carry the load to the countryside this time. He said that he would never look down on those who carried loads again, because he had carried them himself and knew that he could only take one step by putting in one ounce of effort. How adorable this little brother was!</p>
<p>Twenty-two</p>
<p>It is needless to say that country people make jokes when they come to town. Who knew that city people would make jokes when they went to the countryside? Our lovely little brother made no fewer jokes than I did. Let's just talk about one thing. When we walked to the gate of the temple, the little brother pointed to the green fields in front of the temple and said, "How can you eat so much chives that you grow?" This sentence caused everyone to burst into laughter, and the naive little brother was stunned. He didn't know why everyone was laughing. Old Madam Song was quick to say, "This is wheat seedlings, not chives. Do you like to eat chives?" The little brother himself laughed with a red face. Mr. Zhu said, "I've said it before, there are many things you can teach us." Little brother! How happy you are. Old Madam Song taught you what wheat is. You have to carefully compare the wheat seedlings with the chives to find out exactly what the difference is. In the future, as long as you ask people modestly, you will be able to make progress every day. As for things you don't know, you should be brave enough to ask questions, and be shy about talking nonsense."</p>

<p>Twenty-one Post-War Matters</p>
<p>In the 20th century, among the nations of the world, who can find a second race as unpromising as the race in this country? The countries that have fallen have long been working hard to turn over and carry out their vigorous recovery plans, but we are languid and depressed, losing power and humiliating ourselves, spreading ugliness to the world, adding shame to shame, disaster to disaster, piling up firewood under the house, snoring outside, the superiors are still living in luxury and comfort as if nothing happened, and the inferiors are still playing and enjoying themselves in the danger of being slaughtered, and the great disaster is one step closer and one step pressing, and has entered the hall and reached the chamber. The September 18th Incident in Northeast China has not yet ended, and then the great disaster of the January 28th Incident has come to Shanghai, the most prosperous area near the capital, such a heart-wrenching and humiliating event, I don't know if it can awaken the good dreams of officials and people in general, if they wake up from a dream, they may suddenly understand the state of their debts, the sun and the moon, the mountains and rivers are the same, how different are the past and the present? Where is the former prosperity now? Where are the former fields now? What is left of the former culture now? The ancestors painstakingly created, the reputation of history, and we ourselves cut it off, how can we not feel ashamed, not to mention only ashamed?</p>
<p>The resistance of the 19th Route Army and the 5th Army for 34 days, sacrificing the blood and flesh of thousands of martyrs and destroying the lives and property of tens of thousands of civilians, only resulted in a ceasefire agreement. The takeover committee of the withdrawal area was actually established. However, the enemy troops temporarily bid farewell, who can guarantee that there will be no future troubles? If they are foolish and selfish, and do not strengthen themselves, then what is the use of signing thousands of agreements? Treating the head when it hurts, treating the feet when they hurt, what is the point of the method of neither dying nor living? Relying on the treaty, the enemy, whose army has not withdrawn, can use it as coercion and threat at any time and anywhere. The poem says "When the sky is just beginning, do not let it leak," Gongzi said, "Walking on frost is colder than walking on solid ice, birds in the rain are more worried than birds in the wind, numbness is worse than ulcers, and withered flowers are more miserable than dead wood." The country has not fallen, but the pain is worse than the fall of the country. The Songhu war zone has not been lost, but the disaster is more severe than the loss of land. Compatriots, compatriots, do not forget that when the news of the takeover of the war zone comes, the joy of restoring the highest power is buried with endless hidden worries.</p>
<p>Under deep pain, mourning like losing parents is useless, blood vessels bursting and hair standing on end is useless, bowing heads and stretching eyebrows, and speaking frankly is even more useless, only by thinking about the pain and exploring the past, and striving for the future, can we heal the wounds and restore vitality, "Everything that can be destroyed by human power can also be restored by human power," this is a Western saying, I hope the people of the country remember it, even if the war zone is ashes, as long as the people do not become sand worms, and the government does not become foolish, constantly inspiring and encouraging each other, creating new material resources, and laying a solid new foundation, then the educational undertakings in the war zone will not be difficult to restore to their original state, and it will not be difficult to develop and grow. If we are not a nation that is about to perish, if we are a nation with ambition, then with the flesh and blood and white bones of the heroic martyrs who defended the country as the raw materials for the development of Shanghai, the future culture will be more difficult to promote and develop, "A virtuous person can govern the country, only in times of great difficulty can the country be prosperous." Compatriots, compatriots, this is an opportunity to awaken us, this is the driving force for innovation and self-improvement, only with hard work can we reap a thriving harvest, now let's talk about the cultivation of educational undertakings after taking over the territory.</p>
<p>The post-war measures for educational undertakings in the war zone should be divided into two major steps: symptomatic treatment and fundamental treatment, and the government and the people should make efforts in both directions. First, let's talk about the problem of symptomatic treatment.</p>
<p>(1) Symptomatic treatment The first thing after taking over Shanghai, the reporter feels that there is no need to rush to the construction of education, I have heard that in the Japanese earthquake in September of the 12th year of Taisho, Tokyo lost a total of 1.4 billion yuan, they erected temporary school buildings of white wood in the ruins and broken walls, and engaged in educating children. Six years after the disaster, the Kyoto Reconstruction Bureau did not start work on the government and its affiliated organs, but only on 117 elementary schools that stood tall in the sky. The construction cost of each school was more than 1.5 million Japanese gold, and the number of schools was more than before the earthquake, this seems to be a good material worth referring to for today's authorities, the reporter's opinion is that the current government should urgently hire experts and enthusiastic educators to set up a "War Zone Education Rehabilitation Committee" to plan the rehabilitation of education affairs, after the war zone is restored, the government can first start investigating, all facilities, should be based on the results of the investigation as a basis, the investigation should focus on whether the transportation is convenient, whether the population is large, whether the school-age children are gathered, if the above conditions require a school, then immediately set up a "temporary primary school", the standard for setting up a temporary primary school is not whether there is a school building, but the number of students, if there are 30 school-age children in a certain area, then a single-grade temporary primary school can be set up, and the current unemployed teachers can be used to fill the position, extend the daily teaching time, attend classes as usual on Sundays, stop putting on the summer vacation, make up for a semester's study, use time and space in the evening to enroll out-of-school adults, the poor are exempt from fees and given books and stationery, so that people who are out of school are proud to come to school, and those who are studying are persuaded to study hard, so as not to make those who have been educated sit and be idle, and those who have not been educated drop out of school for a long time, there are not many public secondary schools, and there are nine private secondary schools in Zhabei and five in Jiangwan that have been registered, and all classes are now taught elsewhere, it is certainly good to return to the original site this semester, and those who are not strong enough have to postpone their return to their hometown, fortunately, the middle school students are a little afraid of the years, and it is convenient to go to school and stay, schools with higher education buildings that have not been destroyed seem to be able to return early, so as to make full use of the good facilities, The principal is to end the University Department in Guangzhou and prepare for the establishment of a Middle School Department, and will personally return to Guangdong to plan everything, and will take the Coolidge mail ship south today, and it is expected that he will stay there for two weeks.</p>

<h3 id="e120">Japan Not Permitted to Be Optimistic <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>First-Rate Performances Show Signs of Decline</p>
<p>Newcomers Lack Sufficient Confidence</p>
<p>Economic Impact Reduces Delegation Size</p>
<p>Germany Sends Only Nineteen Men and Women</p>
<p>For the World Olympic Games to be held in Los Angeles this autumn, the Japanese delegation has already decided to send 26 male and 9 female athletes, with Hiroshi Hasumi, Koichi Oyama, Toru Takada, and Yoshio Oki taking on the roles of instructors. According to observers familiar with the Japanese sports scene, it is difficult to predict the extent to which the Japanese track and field team will be able to perform this time, based on information from various sources. The reason is that in this spring's Olympic regional preliminaries in Japan and in the athletic leagues of universities and vocational schools, the once invincible Oda, Nakajima, Ichida, Kimura, Oshima and other athletes have encountered various obstacles. Although newcomers still possess the spirit of the old guard and are working extraordinarily hard, the date of the games is fast approaching. The Japanese plan to have those with rich experience at the forefront, with energetic newcomers as support, but those who could be alone are showing signs of decline, and the newcomers lack sufficient confidence, so it is difficult to be optimistic about the competitive prospects. Furthermore, due to economic factors, various European countries are also not enthusiastically sending athletes this year. For example, Germany is only sending 12 men and 7 women, indicating that in addition to sending elite athletes to participate in the upcoming Olympics, many countries also have a few first-rate individuals who are quietly observing the future success or failure within their own countries.</p>

<p>New Price Hangs at 6.9005 Candareens</p>
<p>Actually Opens a Historically Unprecedented Record</p>
<p>The Downward Trend Still Seems Unable to Be Halted</p>
<p>Market Overview: The intensity of this time's currency depreciation is truly unprecedented to us. With the Shanghai currency experiencing such volatility, it is appropriate that the economies of other ports are experiencing a huge impact, and the Shanghai silver and money industry still does not engage in remedies, but instead engages in short selling and long selling. Although the market's buying and selling are brave, it is probably because each individual's vision is different, and the truth is that there is no certainty about the practical future. According to yesterday's total decline of more than four candareens in both markets, it was indeed the first loud sound after entering the 7 candareen mark, but anticipating that such a loud sound will become familiar thereafter, one cannot help but be afraid.</p>
<p>Currency Exchange Prices: The "Foreign Currency" market was weak in the morning, but unexpectedly, large holders continued to sell, causing the market sentiment to deteriorate significantly. The currency price fell sharply by 2 candareens compared to the previous afternoon, to 6.92 candareens. The afternoon market fell another 1.5 candareens, to 6.905 candareens, which is more than 4 candareens lower than the low price in the early morning of the previous day. The "Silver Exchange" market was open for white borrowing in both the morning and afternoon, and the silver supply was extremely loose. However, the overhead increased due to the influx of funds into the bank, and the increase turned upward, calculated at 1.56 candareens, reaching a high of 1.89 candareens.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market Conditions: Jiangnan small silver dollars had to fall along with the excessive depreciation of foreign currency, calculated as a decrease of 2 candareens, to 5.95 candareens. The trading volume was 6,000 jiao in the morning market and 2,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Guangdong small silver dollars also fell sharply by 4.5 candareens in order to accompany the shift in foreign currency, calculated as 5.9025 candareens in the morning market and 5.895 candareens in the afternoon market. Therefore, although the market price has fallen, the exchange rate on the exchange license has not changed significantly. The trading volume was 125,000 jiao in the morning market and 30,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins remained unchanged, still at 425,500 wen per thousand.</p>
<p>Silver and Foreign Currency Inflow and Outflow: "Silver Funds" yesterday's market saw more funds collected by banks. In terms of receipts and disbursements, it was still average. Chinese merchants received and disbursed 1.7 to 1.8 million in ticket funds, foreign merchants received and disbursed over 2 million in ticket funds, 7 to 8 million in exchange, goods mortgage, and miscellaneous funds, over 500,000 in customs duties, over 500,000 in special funds, 500,000 in Chinese merchant warehouse funds, 700,000 in foreign merchant funds, over 26 million in money shop silver receipts and disbursements, over 4.5 million in overhead funds, over 400,000 in remittances from various sources, and 7 to 800,000 in cash disbursements. "Foreign Currency" exchange ticket funds made 580,000 in the morning market, banknotes 70,000, and off-market banknotes 100,000. In the afternoon market, exchange ticket funds were 1.19 million, banknotes 50,000, and off-market 40,000. The afternoon market was so large because colleagues were covering shorts or going long with each other. Bank transactions were 500,000 in the morning market and 900,000 in the afternoon market. The inflow and outflow of foreign currency accounts in various banks was over 1.9 million, and the inflow and outflow of banknotes was over 1.1 million. The collection and disbursement of foreign public bills by money shops was 6.78 million, the collection and disbursement of foreign currency overhead funds was over 3.5 million, foreign currency borrowing was over 2.1 million, and the buying and selling inflow and outflow of small money shops was 4 to 500,000.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Tael of Gold Is Mediocre and Lacks Distinctiveness <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Fluctuations of Four Candareens: Yesterday, the tael of gold's form was mediocre, with a total change of only four candareens throughout the day, ultimately rising slightly. At first, it rose due to the decline in the silver market, and buyers, such as the Dalian gang, Hengxing, Bingxing, Daxing, and Yong, were active. Moreover, as the swap was approaching, the bulls increased their positions. Subsequently, it rose to 729 taels. As foreign exchange was still flat, there seemed to be more sellers. At noon, it was slightly short, and the market was standing flat at around 27 taels. Finally, the Guangdong gang suddenly sold off, causing it to turn towards stability. This session's swap has been promoted by various sources to ten taels. Now, the record of the front and rear markets will be recorded later.</p>
<p>Opening Price Rises by Two Candareens and One Cent: The opening price for July rose by two candareens and one cent to 727 taels. The recent decline in large bars was one-sixteenth, and there were many sellers of forward contracts, even at a loss of seven or eight cents, to 26 taels and two cents. Subsequently, due to purchases by the Dalian gang and others, and because the initial settlement of US dollars for August was 31 yuan, it could then be sold, and the price rose by more than two candareens to 28 taels and five cents. Before long, Dadecheng and others sold, falling back one tael and four cents, calculated at 27 taels and one cent. At 9:30, when the HSBC price remained unchanged, it was 28 taels, and Taichang and others came to sell, while the internal UK gold for September was done at 1875, and it fell back to 26 taels and four cents. After 10 o'clock, Hengyu and others bought in, and the Mei Yin company purchased US dollars for June at 625 to 5625. Mitsui also absorbed 4375 for October, and the first order only settled at 8 pence. Then, Huabi absorbed 0625 for July, pulling up more than two taels until 11:15, reaching 29 taels. Later, Hengxing sold off, and Taichang and others also sold, and it fell back more than two taels, and at 11:30, it was 26 taels and five cents. Then, it rose by more than one tael to 27 taels and nine cents, and at noon, it closed at 27 taels and three cents, with the quotation still at 793 taels, calculated at 65 to 66 taels.</p>
<p>Afternoon Was Flat: The afternoon market initially opened at 27 taels, then rose from six taels and nine candareens to seven taels and four candareens. Trading was sparse. Then, Hengxing came to sell, and the exchange market seemed strong. Maccary released UK gold for September at 125, and Meifeng released US dollars at 31 yuan and 25 cents, and the gold price was slightly less than two taels. At 3:00, it was 26 taels and a half. Hengyu bought in, and at 3:30, it was seven and a half taels. Later, it was suppressed by four or five cents to 27 taels. After 3:45, the buying side seemed diligent, with Fengyong and others buying in. Zhejiang also absorbed US dollars for September at 3125. At 4:00, it was 27 taels and eight cents. Shortly after, Hengxing, Liangxing and others worked together to sell, plunging three taels to 24 taels and nine cents. At 4:30, the closing price was 25 taels and two cents, slightly higher than the previous day by three cents. According to the largest price of 29 taels and the smallest price of 24 taels and nine cents, the difference was four taels and one cent. The quotation was calculated at 65 to 66 taels to 68 taels. The registered price was 27 taels, the replenishment was 27 taels, and the afternoon was 25 taels. The bare strip was calculated to add nine taels.</p>
<p>Trading Is Still Busy: According to the statistics on the surface trading, Bingxing, Hengyu, Fuyu, Daxingyong, Qianchangxiang, Yongfeng, Wanxing, Shunli, and Futaiheng all increased their positions. Tong Taichang, Zhuanghe, and Hongkangyong had more outflows than inflows. Zhifeng, Yongyuantai, Yuanchun, and Dacheng had mixed inflows and outflows.

<h3 id="e126">Foreign Exchange First Rises and Then Loosens <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silver market fell again, and the exchange rate dropped slightly. However, the HSBC exchange rate did not change at all, indicating that the price of bank transactions did not change much either. It was flat in the morning, then it rose, and it seemed to loosen in the afternoon. As a result, compared to the previous evening, the UK gold was even, and the US dollar was slightly reduced by 0.0625. As for the gold market, it was initially strong and then declined, with a turnover of only four taels throughout the day. However, with the swap approaching, the short side still posted, and in general, the multi-party was under pressure due to the lack of spot goods. Moreover, the US dollar from July to August also required a premium of 25 (calculated as six taels), and the hedgers had no choice but to increase the swap. The trading volume in the front and rear markets yesterday was estimated at 100,000 pounds of UK gold, with mostly interbank transactions, and varying inflows and outflows for the gold gang. The total US dollar volume was approximately 1 million, with various houses picking up near and selling far, and the Mei Yin company purchasing June and July, resulting in a stable market, it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e127">Lin Bond Frequently Shrinks <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The National News Agency reported from London on the 10th that the large bond shrank again. The closing price for both near and far futures was 16 pence 875, with the near futures shrinking by one-sixteenth and the far futures shrinking by one-eighth compared to the previous day.

<h3 id="e128">Securities and Bond Prices Show Mixed Gains and Losses <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The Trend Is Peaceful and Transactions Increase Slightly</p>
<p>Yesterday (10th), the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange's bond market conditions saw various types of bonds open in both the front and rear markets. However, trading was still scarce, with only 46,000 yuan done throughout the day. The Central Unified Tax accounted for 14,000 yuan, and the others were all less than 10,000 yuan. Although futures trading increased, the market sentiment was still weak, and market conditions were as idle as before. It is estimated that 2.2 million was traded in the morning and only 1.3 million in the afternoon, totaling 3.58 million yuan. Domestic salt tax was 970,000, 20 Customs was 840,000, and the rest were only 2-300,000. The 96 and Whole 6 relationships were extremely clear, and the July futures trading was as scarce as before. As for the trend of various bond prices, it was that large holders were watching and not moving, and market transactions were scattered. Therefore, the prices were also inconsistent, with mixed gains and losses compared to the previous day. In general, the recent futures were in good demand and saw more rebounds. For example, the June 6 bond rose 8 jiao and a half, and the current month's Unified Salt Tax also rose 5 jiao and a half, with the rest gaining about 2-3 jiao. However, the far futures mostly continued to weaken, and the spot goods also mostly rose. However, the July futures for the 1920 Roll Bond and the Disbandment 19 Customs Good and other next month futures fell quite significantly due to the lack of recent transactions, it is said.</p>

<p>(American Eastern Bank Report)</p>
<p>On Thursday, the New York stock market was filled with concerns about the Bonus Bill, and commercial news was mixed, so the market fluctuated throughout the day without a clear trend. The front market saw a sharp rise due to many short covering, but then the price fell again as the bulls took the opportunity to sell. Oppenheim Automobile shares climbed strongly by eight points, which could have triggered a rising trend, but the price of wheat fell, affecting securities, so the closing price was not much different from the previous day. Many public utility shares were traded, and "American Telephone and Telegraph" hit a new low. According to a telegram from Pierce Company, the cleanup of public utility shares has not yet been completed, so a further decline is expected. On the Congressional side, the session may be extended because the Bonus Bill has not yet been voted on, which is detrimental to the securities market, because if the country's major policies are not determined, then people's hearts cannot be at peace. If the Bonus Bill can be resolved as soon as possible, then Congress can be expected to adjourn next Monday. (Attached Dow Jones daily index as left)</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<p>Yarn Market</p>
<p>Still in a Tired and Sluggish State</p>
<p>American Cotton Five-Cent Line Has Been Breached</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn Market Condition: The morning was flat and the afternoon fell, with a very tired trend. This is because the American cotton five-cent line has already been broken, and actual sales customers see the environment as bad and do nothing. Business is becoming more and more deserted. Buyers are becoming increasingly uneasy about the global situation, but some manufacturers have the intention to maintain it, because the stock is not thick at present, so they have slightly purchased in recent months. In short, the general situation is difficult to be optimistic about, and it is best for Chinese factories to sell off as the trend goes.</p>
<p>People's Standard Later Market Drop Is Strong: People's Standard opened in the morning, and although American cotton was closed, the market sentiment was still flat. General retail investors were active and short covering, and the market did not fall. Each month rose slightly by two, three, four, or six cents. In the afternoon, it was heard that actual demand had stopped, and the drop was strong. Each month fell eight, nine cents to one or two taels. The total trading volume for the day was 22,000 bales. It was found that Rongxing sold 1,100 bales, Changji 750 bales, Shenchang 850 bales, Ruidai 400 bales, and Changfeng 1,100 bales, Yiyu 700 bales, Minghua bought 600 bales, Yidai 1,100 bales, Yiyu 1,600 bales, and Yichang 750 bales. The closing prices are listed as follows.</p>
<p>People's Standard Closing Rise and Fall Account Balance October 1490 Fell Six 41,500</p>
<p>July 1496 Fell 2 17,300 November 1488 8 30,450 August 1490 6 27,400 Total 148,350 September 1490 4 31,900</p>
<p>Customer Groups Have No Intention of Purchasing Spot: The disposal of spot yarn is stagnant. It was found that the total purchase by various groups throughout the day was only 350 bales. The market price fell by two and a half cents to five cents. Guangdong purchased 35 bales, the Mainland 60 bales, Changsha 10 bales, Nanyang 80 bales, Sichuan 50 bales, Haizhou 5 bales, Fujian 5 bales, Xiamen 5 bales, and the fellow industry bought 110 bales, it is said.</p>
<p>Under Extreme Pressure from American Cotton</p>
<p>The Cotton Market Is Extremely Pessimistic</p>
<p>American cotton has once again found a new low in a hundred years, and the seven-cent mark for July has been broken, causing a great shock in people's minds. The buying side has not yet shown a very terrifying situation, but the China Trade Company, in view of the turbulent global trend and the extremely fearful situation of foreign cotton, has no demand for the spot goods handled in the production area, and has to hedge in the futures market to avoid danger. However, some Shanghai cotton merchants, with their small bases, believe that the price of 29 taels has not been seen for many years, and think that there is no need to worry about falling again. Some flower merchants have greatly reversed their long positions, but measuring the overall situation, the cotton market is in a very pessimistic situation. It is said that a tragic drop has also been found in Tianjin cotton. Therefore, there is still a scene of intense changes to be realized in the future of the Standard Cotton.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Continued to Fall Four Cents in the Afternoon: Zheng Biao opened in the morning, and some retail investors short-covered and profited, and the market atmosphere was calm. In the afternoon, it was heard that the selling price of American cotton was only 29 taels. This cotton can spin 20-count yarn. There is also a saying that American An Yiyang Bank has 100,000 pieces of American cotton to be shipped to Shanghai for sale, which caused more panic in people's minds. Each month fell three or four cents. The total trading volume for the day was 46,700 dan.

<h3 id="e131">Recent News of the Disastrous Fall in West River Cotton Prices <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Large Inventory, Low Sales, Good New Production</p>
<p>Lowest Peak Since the Third Year of the Republic at 18 Taels</p>
<p>Tianjin, 6th dispatch: Recently, the market price of West River cotton has plummeted, a rare occurrence in recent years. On June 1st, the price was 27 taels, but yesterday it reached a low of 23 taels and 5 qian. Enquiries made to fellow traders reveal that the decline in cotton prices this year is an undeniable fact. The recent sharp drop is due to: firstly, the holiday season is approaching, and Japanese merchants are taking a wait-and-see attitude, with little purchasing activity; secondly, general cotton merchants, seeing abundant rainfall this year, anticipate a good autumn harvest, and also because many Tianjin-produced cotton bales have failed inspection, cotton merchants urgently needing funds are impatiently selling off their stock. Moreover, spinning mills reportedly have enough inventory for two months of use, so one European merchant is inactive. Although it is impossible to predict how far the market price will fall, observations suggest this is the lowest price in the past fifteen years. In the third year of the Republic, the lowest price was 18 or 19 taels, but it soon returned to its former level. This year, the lowest price may reach the 20-tael mark. If furs and other goods become stagnant, it will be difficult to see a significant price drop, as Japanese merchants still have purchasing power, and spinning mills also have significant usage, so cotton demand should be substantial. Moreover, the impact of this price drop is not as great as last year's, when cotton prices rose and fell sharply, dropping from over 40 taels to below 30 taels, catching people off guard. Therefore, cotton brokers, warehouses, and money houses all suffered considerable losses.</p>
<p>After this price drop, the amount of losses is said to be around 1.6 million. Customers who stockpiled and provided funds are sharing this loss. Fortunately, most customers are creditworthy, so there have been no reports of bankruptcies. As for the cotton inventory in Tianjin, it currently remains around 145,000 bales, it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e132">Changshu Cocoon Production Reaching Its End <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Overall Harvest Not Even 20%: Quality Lower</p>
<p>Changshu, the spring silkworms in the four suburban villages initially suffered from the military influence, and the number of people raising them was less than 40% of last year. Then, due to unfavorable weather and widespread silkworm diseases, many early silkworms lost their leaves. Although some late silkworms were raised in the Pengjiaqiao area, cocoon production was extremely poor, almost reaching its end, with the overall harvest not even 20%. The quality of the cocoons was lower than last year. Very few cocoon markets have opened. Silkworm farmers have cocoons but nowhere to sell them. Cocoon prices are only opening at 15 or 16 yuan, and they are all being dried in earthen stoves, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Zhenmei Green Tea European Sales Activity <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, European firms showed increasing interest in both Luzhuang and Tuzhuang Zhenmei green tea, and trading was brisk. The British firm Jardine Matheson has added a tea purchasing office on Sichuan Road to expand its business scope. It is said that there is a considerable need for waxed Zhenmei and Luzhuang Pingshui large batches. The green tea market is showing signs of a turnaround. However, the market for Qimen black tea has become quiet. Yesterday, only Jinlong Xiehe and other firms purchased over 500 boxes of medium and low-grade tea, with no trading in high-grade tea, it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e134">Rice Prices Fall by 2 Jiao <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>South Shanghai: Supplies from the west road remain abundant, totaling about 70 boats. People are calm. Regular batches of Zhongguan goods and Sutong batches are each 2 jiao lower. Early rice, "Flying Phoenix," from Sha Chuan batch was sold for several hundred piculs. The trend is falling by a few jiao. Thin rice trading is sluggish in this street, and the opening price is lowered by a few fen. By afternoon, it plummeted three chi. Foreign "Du Jian" is selling at a breakeven price. The market is neither rising nor falling.</p>
<p>Zhabei: For the past two days, due to the rice merchants' year-end closing accounts, the number of boats arriving from the west road has been limited. Trading in this street turned active in the morning, but appetite waned slightly in the afternoon. Xisu's price was fresh and tight at the opening, but secondary colors fell by 1-2 jiao. Early and late rice each shortened by one chi. "Yin Hua Bian Yuan" followed and fell 5 yuan. The total volume of He Xia grain feet throughout the day was about 3,000 piculs.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Han Batch Trying Small-Size Cleaned Rice <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Nearly 195,000 Bags Arrived on Three Boats in the Last Three Days</p>
<p>Inventory Sufficient... Price Down Another Jiao</p>
<p>Yesterday, the movement of foreign rice remained sluggish. The Han batch tried to sell 600 bags of small-size cleaned rice on the market because the Shanghai market had rebounded slightly. The Jiangbei batch also sold over 1,000 bags of small-size cleaned rice, and the market finally leveled off after being sluggish. This street had a slight appetite for aged small-scale rice, but the number of transactions was small. Statistics show that 3,000 bags of new small-size cleaned rice were opened at a price of 10 yuan, 4 jiao 5 fen to 2 jiao. Also, 500 bags of aged small-scale rice were sold at a price of 10 yuan, 3 jiao to 2 jiao 5 fen. 500 bags of red large-scale cleaned rice were sold at a price of 9 yuan, 6 jiao 6 fen to 6 jiao 2 fen. The market is down another jiao or so compared to yesterday, and the outlook is still not good, because at the end of last month, there were 1,045,000 bags of rice in stock (excluding national reserves, goods waiting to be loaded, and rice shop inventory). Recently, 195,000 bags arrived on three boats in the last three or four days. Currently, the total floating inventory on the market is 240,000 bags, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Flour Manufacturers Dumping Stock <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Prices Plunging Over 4 Fen Each Month</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market: after opening in the morning, prices for each month were initially stable, but because foreign wheat prices fell by another jiao or so (Chicago recently fell to around 4 jiao 9 fen), and because actual sales were sluggish, manufacturers, despite wanting to hold on to their chips, were unable to resist the fact that various grains were all falling, so flour prices were unlikely to be bullish. Given this situation, buyers were scarce, and the market situation softened again. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, the market atmosphere suddenly plunged wildly. Because a certain manufacturer slightly dumped stock, and the number of buyers decreased even more, the supply and demand gap widened, and a price drop was inevitable. The lowest price for July reached 8 qian, 6 fen, 7 li and a half, and the price for August reached 8 qian, 6 fen and a half, a difference of 5 fen from the closing price of the previous day. However, the closing price rose slightly, perhaps as a last hurrah. As a result, July fell by 3 fen and 7 li and a half compared to the previous day, August fell by 4 fen and 2 li and a half, September fell by 3 fen and 2 li and a half, October fell by 3 fen and 7 li and a half, and November fell by 3 fen and a half.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Wheat Futures Market Weakening Again <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market: after opening in the morning, the market for each month remained sluggish, and trading was also sparse. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, trading was smoother, but the market atmosphere weakened again and again because it is currently the peak season for new wheat to gradually enter the market, and manufacturers in this port have traditionally set up warehouses in the interior to purchase wheat, but this year they have no need for it because of the abundant supply of flour recently. This adverse environment is difficult to reverse in the short term (the quoted price for silver-top wheat is only 5 yuan, 3 jiao and 4 fen), so when sellers become active, the market atmosphere cannot avoid a setback. As a result, July fell by 5 fen compared to the previous day, August and September fell by 6 fen, October fell by 5 fen, and November fell by 4 fen, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Sugar Market: Raw Sugar and White Sugar Gradually Trending Upwards <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, trading on the sugar market association market was still brisk. The transaction price for 24-grade Dutch sugar was 14 taels, and the price for Hong Kong goods was 13 taels, 8 qian, 2 fen and a half. Sellers are still scarce, and the market shape is quite handsome. Taikoo sugar from Tianjin was 16 taels and 2 qian, original goods were 16 taels and 4 qian, CW mark was 15 taels and 9 qian, H mark was 12 taels and 5 qian, and there were slight transactions. Occasional transactions, there were bids for 12 taels and 4 qian, but the seller was still holding back. Taikoo spot H mark opened at 500 bags, priced at 6 taels and 5 qian, new regulations and taxes for CW mark are priced at 7 taels and 3 qian and a half, also new regulations including taxes, and the marked price is 16 taels and 1 quan, so the need for firms is scarce. The brokerage plate had Hua Xin Co. selling 300 bags of spot raw sugar, priced at 14 taels, and the market was also stable and not unusual, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Coal: Hard to Improve the Market Prices for White Coal <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the sales of white coal have gradually become more active because customers from the Su and Hangzhou regions have slightly purchased some, but merchants in this port have purchased very little, so the selling price is difficult to improve. Yesterday's market saw 270 tons of Maike white coal traded at a price of 20 taels and 3 qian, 316 tons of Liujiang white coal at a price of 16 taels, 94 tons of Haifeng white coal at a price of 20 taels and 8 qian and a half, and 80 tons of Great Wall white coal at a price of 16 taels and 7 qian and a half. Also, Open Pit No. 1 Slag is currently selling for 9 taels and 1 qian per ton.</p>

<p>The market for new iron wire had previously been trending well because the market was depleted and various merchants were eagerly buying, so the standard rose frequently. For example, sizes 16 to 20 were selling for 13 taels and a half per picul, and sizes 21 to 25 were selling for 14 taels and a half. However, in the past few days, goods have been arriving from various regions one after another, so that the market is flooded, people's confidence is declining, the standard opening price is gradually moving downstream, and the way out is even more sluggish and stagnant. Yesterday, more than 100 piculs were opened, with sizes 16 to 20 selling for 13 taels and sizes 21 to 25 selling for 14 taels, it is said.</p>

<p>Old Man Ma Xiangbo, Ninety-Three Years Old</p>
<h3 id="e141">Only Know How to Imitate the Past, Don't Know How to Seek Progress <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>

<p>The underdevelopment of Chinese crafts is due to the lack of improvement in machinery and tools. "If a craftsman wants to do his job well, he must first sharpen his tools," is an old Chinese saying. But in the Chinese view, things made with sharp tools are not considered anything special. Only working with outdated, clumsy tools is considered Chinese skill. For example, in writing, instead of using a good writing brush, people use chicken feathers, fingernails, or write with a brush held in the mouth, and that is considered art.</p>
<p>Truly, national governance and doctrine are nothing more than guiding the creation of wealth and meeting needs, while safeguarding their freedom. Guiding requires reason, and safeguarding with property rights enables those who are able to persevere. Old Man Ma Xiangbo, Ninety-Three Years Old.</p>
<p>Chinese painting has also made very little progress. Paintings with perspective are considered the work of lowly craftsmen by Chinese connoisseurs. The Chinese only focus on writing, putting all their artistic spirit into it. Foreign alphabets have only twenty-odd letters and cannot be used as decorations, so foreigners cannot consider good handwriting as art. Only in China can one make money by writing for guests.</p>
<p>Foreign letters were created by monks, initially kept secret, and used as a monopoly by monks before being made public. I suspect that the origin of Chinese characters is similar. In fact, handwriting from three or four hundred years ago is not necessarily good, but a group of scholars with nothing to do come up with many tricks, imitating inscriptions from stone tablets. It is clear that the stone tablet is old, the writing is blurred, a stroke is missing, or a dot is missing, but copying it exactly is considered a good style. I think Wang Xizhi wrote cursive script when he was drunk, and even he himself did not recognize it, but later generations competed to copy it, and that is considered a style. So, writing also began to talk about systems and schools. So-and-so writes in the Han style, so-and-so writes in the Northern Wei style, so-and-so writes in the Yan style, so-and-so writes in the Su style, resulting in a variety of styles, and people do not put effort into art, but quarrel over schools. This is like guaranteeing a patron, not asking about ability, but asking who his teacher is.</p>
<p>Not only is writing like this, but so is writing. After the Tang and Song dynasties, there can be said to be no good writing, because everyone competes to establish their own schools, sticks to the old ways, and does not seek progress. What Yang Xiong style, Sima Qian's writing style, Han prose, Su prose, and so on. Everyone only knows how to imitate the past, and does not know how to seek progress. Zhang Taiyan is well-read in the Book of Han and even considers the broken styles of the ancients as ancient styles.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Continued Anecdotes of Resisting Aggression <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— Iron Amitabha</p>
<p>I have already written anecdotes of resisting aggression. Now I have heard more and am writing a continuation.</p>
<p>Mr. He told me. Mr. He lives in Zhabei. On the night of January 28th of this year, he heard the start of the incident. Then the sound of gunfire and artillery gradually approached. Mr. He, curious and forgetful of the danger, crawled to the back of the house and peeked from beside the iron gate pillar. Suddenly, he saw our army retreating, abandoning several soldiers on the road, who looked severely wounded. Just as he was sighing, the enemy's tank had already approached, nearing the abandoned soldiers. The abandoned soldiers suddenly leaped up, each holding a gunpowder canister, and pounced on the enemy tank. A thunderous explosion sounded, accompanied by the enemy soldiers' cries of agony. Mr. He was extremely frightened and fled back. After a while, he only heard the shouts of our army resounding in all directions, and no longer heard the rumble of the tank. (Note: This is the first time the enemy was heavily defeated on Qiujiang Road, as reported in the news. The details were not clear, but now this account supplements the historical omission.)</p>
<p>Also, Mr. Zhao told me that on the night of February 7th, the enemy attacked a certain road. At that time, only three soldiers of our army were guarding this road. Two soldiers were taking a short rest in a house, leaving one soldier, Mr. Mou, on guard. Many enemies were attacking. Bullets rained down, but Mr. Mou did not take it seriously. He rushed to the front barricade, put his helmet on the gun, raised it above the barricade, and moved it left and right, making it seem like there were dozens of people. The enemy saw it in the firelight and immediately fired their guns. Mr. Mou also fired his machine gun intermittently in response. The Japanese knew they were prepared and fired even more densely. Mr. Mou thought the enemy would not dare to approach suddenly, so he ran back to call the resting soldiers. Reinforcements also arrived. The Japanese had not heard the sound of our army for a long time and thought they had fled, so they advanced to attack. Our army suddenly rose up and surrounded them, completely wiping out their entire army.</p>
<p>Also, Mr. Yun told me that a Cantonese man named Mr. Chen was skilled in shooting. One night, he and five or six other soldiers were guarding a certain pass at the North Railway Station. The enemy army attacked with more than thirty men, and their momentum was very fierce. The other soldiers were all worried about their safety. Mr. Chen smiled and said, "Watch me kill these fellows for you." Then they fired several shots and immediately ran to hide behind the barricade more than ten zhang away. The enemy knew they were prepared and attacked even more fiercely. Mr. Chen held his breath and did not respond, holding his machine gun and hiding under the barricade. After a while, the enemy thought they had fled and crossed the barricade to advance. Mr. Chen waited until they were between the barricade and the hiding place, suddenly rose up and attacked them. The hiding soldiers also rose up in response. The enemy, in the darkness and in a hurry, thought that a large army had arrived, and all abandoned their guns and fled, losing more than ten men. The five or six soldiers were unharmed.</p>

<p>Model Servants: Model servants refer to British servants. During America's golden age, many wealthy people traveled to England. They saw that British servants were dignified and composed, and capable in their work. They considered them the best servants in the world. Therefore, they brought many people back to America. From then on, it was considered an honor to have British servants in American society. Colonel Lindbergh, the famous aviator, had a very capable British servant in his home. Even the chef and nanny were British. Therefore, his servants could be considered all British. American society not only liked to hire British servants, but also grooms, jockeys, golf club waiters, yacht captains, and bar managers were often hired from England. They received good treatment and particularly high wages. Unfortunately, they were also affected by the global economic panic. Many wealthy American families went bankrupt and no longer had the ability to hire British servants. Therefore, recently, a large number of British servants and chefs had to pack up and return home to try to find a livelihood in their own country.</p>

<p>Mount Lu is a scenic area in Jiangxi Province. It got its name because of the hermitage of Kuang Su and Lu Ao in the past. My friend Chen Xiaodie loves forests and springs and is not familiar with city life. He has explored the beauty of the Yellow Crane Tower and the wonders of the White Deer Cave. He went on a ten-day trip. The other day, he suddenly sent letters from the mountain to Ms. Xiaoman, Uncle Ya, and me. In his letter to Ms. Xiaoman, he mentioned a dream of seeing Zhimo and composed two poems to record it. Dream matters, although not believed by scientists, but spirits fly through Hessel, and Du Ling records them with poems. Grass grows in spring ponds, and Kang Le proclaims them in his poems. Considering the past, not everything is false. Moreover, wise literary men are born into heaven and become Buddhas. There is a reason for coming and going. With Zhimo's pure heart, how can we know that his spirits are not always in the human world and in heaven? Ms. Xiaoman said that Zhimo often traveled to the southwest, but he always regretted not having traveled enough in Mount Lu. Therefore, Xiaodie's dream has a reason. Xiaodie and Zhimo were close friends to the death, feeling life and remembering death, seeing things and thinking of people, how could he not turn it into a dream? I am recording his poem below. It is also a lyrical event in the literary world. Flying in the eight directions, Jizhou is narrow. I left Wuhui in the morning and arrived at Qiqiu in the evening. I was shaking my clothes on Peifeng Mountain. I was surprised to reach the end of the world. I spread my wings to catch the wild geese on the Yellow River. Who does not die on a carriage or boat? From now on, I can come and go by riding the air. I plan to circle the planet once. Magpie Hua's clouds and objects connect with Mount Lu. The wind horse and spirit car are easy to travel back and forth. Shaking hands, I clearly hear the children's words. In my dream, we are still brothers and friends. I love Mr. Xu the most in my life. Who pities Li Yi'an in this world? A volume of new words in Qingzhao's writing is still there. How difficult is it to die if the feelings are carved deep in the bone?</p>

<h3 id="e146">Stele Inscription of the Ningbo Renji Hospital <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— Feng Duliang</p>
<p>Sea transport has opened, and human affairs have connected. Every day brings increasing complexity, and the spread of diseases and sores is also increasingly difficult to distinguish. Medical practitioners, unless they are thoroughly knowledgeable and insightful, will be unable to adapt and treat them. Western medicine has always emphasized experimentation. The slightest evidence must be thoroughly considered and investigated. The goal is to find the correct treatment and then prescribe medication. Even if there are breakthroughs, they are announced and proclaimed, making it a routine. This is because they can learn from each other and develop, and there is no intention of sticking to the old ways and closing off. Therefore, the art is easy to advance, and the effect is also slightly greater. Our people admire their achievements and gradually imitate them. Therefore, the hospital system arose. However, it is not easy to attract talent, and preparations cannot be simple. Extremely economical management requires huge amounts of money. If finances are insufficient, they often stop halfway. Those who seek profit by taking advantage of the situation can lightly deceive with thin receipts and poor operations. Poor planning leads to more harm. Those who claim to be broad and well-prepared, limited by the initial meticulous planning, often cannot help but exploit the sick and the poor. The sons of the wealthy cherish their health and will not mind bearing a small burden. However, the common people, whose clothes are not complete, once affected by the cold and heat, lack the funds to buy medicine. They either fill the ravines or languish in groans. Is this not the greatest pain of life? My Ningbo has tens of thousands of people, and the poor occupy the majority. Helping the wounded and relieving the distressed is not enough. Jin Jintingsun, a generous gentleman, roams the sea and is known for his prosperity. By nature, he enjoys relaxation and is deeply concerned about his old hometown. He is particularly diligent in giving gifts and tributes. When the autumn epidemic was rampant, the slaves and servants who were raised were often sick and died without seeing a doctor. Coffins were connected on the road. The gentleman looked at them and sighed, "Are these not the people of my neighborhood? How can I not do something for them?" He immediately gave up his family property to create what is called the temporary epidemic hospital. He widely sheltered the sick and the poor and exempted them from payment. Countless people were saved. When the epidemic subsided, the hospital was about to be abandoned. The gentleman punished himself for the past and wanted to expand the hospital and make it permanent. Fearing that he could not handle it alone, he consulted with Du Yuesheng. Du is a man from Shanghai, benevolent and outstanding, just like the gentleman. He agreed to assist the gentleman and conveyed the news to him. The gentleman's spirit grew stronger. He immediately bought land in the north of the city and began construction. The work began in July of the nineteenth year and ended in November of the twentieth year. Long corridors and deep rooms, wide houses and domed halls, were completed one after another. He then hired Dong Dingsong to preside over the hospital affairs, and everything was entrusted to him. Mr. Dong earnestly devoted himself to the work, without shirking labor. He used his hands to set up facilities, meticulously and thoroughly. Everything that a hospital should have was completed in a few months, without any obstacles. Before and after, he spent a total of 300,000 versions of money. All of this was due to the efforts of Mr. Du and Mr. Jin. The hospital was named Renji to show its righteous deeds. On the day of the completion, the wind was clear and the sun was bright. The public praised and admired the two gentlemen. Cai Mingcun and others admired their style and feared that it would be forgotten over time. They had Zhen Xu write the inscription. I believe that the meaning of life is to benefit the group, which is difficult. Mr. Du and Mr. Jin, who have wealth and position, do not enjoy themselves alone, but deeply pity the hardships of the people. They are as concerned as if they were guilty. They are anxious and thoughtful and must find a way to comfort and recommend them before they are relieved. This is the intention of benevolent gentlemen.

<p>— Master of the Seeking Happiness Studio</p>
<p>Chapter Nine: The Special Train Ejects Guests with False Alarms; Sitting Cold in the Office, Turning to Stone in Reverie</p>
<p>But that big man who was always against him was still roaring. "You guys are wasting so much time talking nonsense to this kid. If it were up to me, I'd just kick him off the train. Who cares if he's real or fake?" As he spoke, he opened a big palm, as if he was about to grab An Yutian's collar. Fortunately, the others intervened and stopped the big man, saying, "Stop making trouble. Even if he's fake, give Guo face and let it go." Only then did the big man stop speaking. He lay down on the bed opposite An Yutian, fully clothed, and fell asleep. The remaining soldier had no bed and had to sit at An Yutian's feet, sharing a bed at opposite ends. An Yutian was in a dilemma and could only endure it for the time being. He leaned against the wall, feeling depressed for a while, and dozed off for a while. As the night deepened, he suddenly felt cold and couldn't help but feel more aggrieved. The old thoughts of hating the warlords were stirred up again. He deeply blamed Ye Zuozhang for his ineffective management, saying that even on the special train, it was so chaotic and disorderly, causing the guests to almost be insulted by those wolf-like guards. Where was the courtesy of respecting the virtuous? An Yutian was all misled by his wife, throwing a pearl into darkness. He spent half the night and early morning in annoyance, unable to sleep. He didn't even touch the drinking water, just endured the hunger and cold, losing his freedom, as if he was imprisoned in an army jail, suffering endless pain. Finally, the term of this sentence also had a time to end. The special train arrived at its destination at a little after 11 a.m. After Governor Ye got off the train, An Yutian was finally freed from the invisible surveillance by the guards and slipped off the train as if he was escaping. He suddenly remembered to find his wife. But at this time, there were not many people at the station. He couldn't guess if they had gotten off the train already. If they had left with Fifth Wife long ago, he would have nowhere to find them, wandering around like a homeless dog. He looked around the station, about to complain, when someone suddenly pushed him hard. He turned around and saw Mao Deshun dragging him anxiously and saying, "Secretary An, where on earth did you go? Last night, I heard the commander give those instructions to Deputy Guo, and I assumed you were with the commander in a carriage, so I told the wives and was relieved. But this morning, when the train was about to arrive, your wife told me to find you so we could get off the train together. It took me a lot of effort to find you, and I searched all the compartments and living rooms on the train. There was no sign of you. I wanted to ask Guo, but that kid stayed in Beijing for some other business and didn't come. I thought you had missed the train too. The wives were all very anxious and told me to search the station again. I only found you now. What's going on with you?"</p>

<p>Japanese Navy Fully Withdraws from the Deadline</p>
<h3 id="e148">Japan Will Officially Reply <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Around the 13th</p>
<p>Regarding the complete withdrawal of Japanese Marines, excluding the temporary garrison area, after the four-week deadline stipulated in the armistice agreement had passed, and then extended for another week, the Japanese side has yet to provide a definite indication of withdrawal. As of the night before last, it was discovered that Japanese soldiers were deploying positions in the Sajing Port area. After receiving the report, we initially intended to notify the Joint Committee and convene a meeting if necessary. However, according to a report that the deployment was removed yesterday, the matter was terminated. Details of various reports are recorded below:</p>
<p>Full Withdrawal Indicated　Regarding the withdrawal of Japanese Marines from the area east of the Zhabei section of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway and the eastern part of Sajing Port, Mr. Okazaki, the Japanese member of the Joint Committee, stated yesterday that the withdrawal date has not yet been decided. Due to the large number of Japanese residents in these two areas, withdrawal will likely occur only when the Japanese residents there are no longer experiencing panic. As for the small number of Japanese Marines at the Shanghai West Tongwen Academy, the Toyota Mill, the Wusong Huafeng Mill, and the Pingliang Road Gong</p>
<p>Da Mill, they will be withdrawn very soon. However, the locations of the Gong Da Mill, the Toyota Mill, and the Tongwen Academy are on roads built beyond the settlement boundaries (?).</p>
<p>Reply on the 13th　Regarding the reply from the Japanese member of the Joint Committee to the demand made by our member of the Joint Committee for the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops, it was rumored to be officially delivered today (the 11th). According to a reporter's inquiry to Mr. Okazaki, he said that because the 11th is a Saturday, and Japanese naval authorities have various social engagements, and the 12th is also a Sunday, the official reply must be given after the 13th. Moreover, Mr. Langer, the secretary of the Joint Committee, stated in a phone call to a reporter from the New Voice News Agency that the Japanese Navy's withdrawal will be officially replied to on Monday, the 13th.</p>
<p>Number of Troops Not Withdrawn　Regarding the withdrawal of Japanese troops, according to Mr. Okazaki, the army has already withdrawn. There are approximately 40 Marines at the Wusong Huafeng Mill. The number of Marines at the Toyota Mill, the Gong Da Mill, and the Tongwen Academy is roughly the same. Although the exact number of those still remaining in Shanghai is unknown, it is estimated to be over 2,500.</p>
<p>Deployment Removed　Regarding the deployment of Japanese troops and the erection of barbed wire west of Sajing Port at 5:30 PM the day before yesterday, after receiving a report from the Third Section of the Fifth District, the Management Committee notified our member of the Joint Committee, requesting that the matter be brought up in the Joint Committee. At that time, Commissioners Yu Hongjun and Wen Yingxing considered the matter briefly and decided to first send a letter to the chairman of the Joint Committee, and then convene a meeting if necessary. However, according to a report from the Public Security Bureau yesterday morning, the barbed wire at the Hu Jia Mu Bridge and the Xiangyan Bridge had been removed, and the searches of pedestrians had also been canceled. Therefore, Commissioners Yu and others immediately stopped notifying the Joint Committee. It was also reported that the Japanese troops only erected barbed wire and searched pedestrians the day before yesterday, and did not deploy positions.</p>
<p>Although the deployment was removed yesterday, occasional stray soldiers are still being spotted.</p>
<p>Sajing Port</p>
<h3 id="e149">Japanese Soldiers Still Spotted Yesterday <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Barbed Wire at Hu Jia Mu Bridge Removed After Negotiations</p>
<p>Public Security Bureau Says No Accidents Expected</p>
<p>In the area west of Sajing Port in East Shanghai, Japanese soldiers have been spotted recently, checking pedestrians, deploying positions, and setting up barbed wire, causing considerable alarm among nearby residents. Japanese soldiers were still traveling there yesterday, but according to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, this has been happening sporadically for days and no accidents are expected. The barbed wire at the Hu Jia Mu Bridge was removed yesterday morning. The news obtained yesterday is recorded below:</p>
<p>Japanese Soldiers Still Traveling　Japanese Army and Navy battle troops went to the area west of Sajing Bridge, Xiangyan Bridge, and Hu Jia Mu Bridge the night before last and last night for extensive searches. At 11:00 AM yesterday, they patrolled the area again, with about thirty to forty people, all fully armed, patrolling in armored vehicles, creating a serious situation. They left after about an hour.</p>
<p>Barbed Wire Removed　The barbed wire installed by the Japanese army at the Hu Jia Mu Bridge the day before yesterday was several feet long, with only a narrow pedestrian walkway in the middle, barely wide enough for one person to pass through. Those crossing the bridge had to be searched. After the barbed wire was installed, the Municipal Public Security Bureau, upon receiving a report, forwarded it to the Management Committee, requesting that Mr. Yu Hongjun, our member of the Joint Committee, go and negotiate with the Japanese side, stating that this matter could easily cause misunderstandings and should be removed. The Japanese side immediately ordered the Marines to remove it yesterday morning. By the afternoon, the Hu Jia Mu Bridge was able to be passed without obstruction.</p>
<p>Reasons for Japanese Military Patrols　The sudden appearance of Japanese soldiers west of Sajing Port this time has caused considerable suspicion in the outside world. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency has learned that the reason is that traitors are hiding in the area west of Sajing Port, opening gambling dens and "swallow nests." There are now more than a dozen large and small gambling dens in the area. Fearing that they would be discovered by the police, they asked the Japanese army to maintain strict guard.</p>
<p>Eastern District Still Peaceful　Yesterday afternoon, a reporter went to the area west of Sajing Port and Tiantong Road, Hu Jia Mu Bridge, and Xiangyan Bridge in the Eastern District and saw that the Japanese soldiers had retreated. The situation in the area was still peaceful, but there were few pedestrians. This area is originally a desolate place. Linping Road, Hongzhen, and Xingang have been taken over by our side, so they are quite lively and many shops are open as usual. However, there is still a curfew at night.</p>
<p>Statement from the Public Security Bureau　Yesterday morning, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency interviewed Gong Xikui, the Inspector General of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, about the situation in East Shanghai. According to him, the situation there is not as serious as reported. The area is as normal. There have been many rumors in Zhabei in recent days, causing anxiety among the people. He advised the outside world not to believe them lightly. Later,</p>
<p>he visited Wu Yanxun, the chief of the Third Section of the Fifth District, which has jurisdiction over East Shanghai. According to him, the area patrolled by the Japanese soldiers is the area that our side has not yet taken over. The Third Section of the Fifth District has six police stations: Hongzhen, Xingang Road, Linping Road, Jixiang Road, Oujia Road, and Pingmin Village. Currently, Hongzhen, Xingang Road, and Linping Road have been recovered, but the rest have not yet been recovered. Therefore, the Japanese soldiers spotted in recent days have been in the unrecovered area. It is estimated that they are sent out by the Japanese garrison team in the Fourth District (i.e., Zhabei District). However, they are only patrolling and not permanently deploying positions. They leave after staying for some time and there are no conflicts. The area is still quite peaceful.</p>

<h3 id="e150">Navy Continues to Send Ships to Shanghai <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>24 Squads Assigned to Stay in Shanghai</p>
<p>The Retreat of the Third Fleet</p>
<p>Except for some of the invading Japanese Navy's Third Fleet that has already retreated, the flagship, cruisers, 15 destroyer squadrons, and part of the Navy remaining in Shanghai are scheduled to return to Japan today. However, while the Japanese side is withdrawing its Navy, it is secretly sending a large number of Marines and water police to Shanghai to strengthen its garrison. Details of this matter, after detailed investigation, are reported below.</p>
<p>Izumo Moves　The flagship Izumo, on which the commander of the First Fleet, Nomura, is stationed, has laid out a balloon and electric net in front of the Japanese Consulate to prevent mines. Yesterday, Nomura ordered the ship to move to Yangshupu this morning and dock at Osaka Wharf. The electric net and balloons that were set up were ordered to be removed. Of the seven or eight hundred officers and soldiers on board, it was ordered yesterday that they were not allowed to go ashore without reason. Those who were transferred to land last time will all return to the ship this morning. Commanders Nomura, Shiozawa, and Uematsu are scheduled to board the ship at Osaka Wharf at 11:00 AM today and leave Shanghai at the same time as the light cruiser Tokiwa, heading straight for Japan.</p>
<p>Additional Ships to Replenish　The Shanghai Japanese Navy, starting today, will outwardly return to the state before January 28. Future deployments of warships will be under the control of the First Outer Detachment of the Yangtze River. However, after the 15th squadron of four torpedo boats is withdrawn to Sasebo on Monday, the Japanese Navy Ministry has decided to assign four destroyers from the 24th squadron to Shanghai to strengthen the Japanese Navy's forces in Shanghai. An electric order was sent by the Navy Ministry yesterday to inform them of this.</p>
<p>Secretly Sending Naval Troops　Before the Third Fleet departs, the Japanese Navy Ministry secretly transferred a large team of Marines from the Sasebo Naval Corps to Shanghai. The first batch of soldiers arrived in Shanghai yesterday, including a large team of officers and soldiers such as Yasukawa, Omatsu, Nakamura, Shimada, Kuwahara, Yoshida Katsushi, and Koga. Some of them were assigned to the Shanghai Marine Corps, and some were ordered to replenish the strength of the 24th Fleet.</p>
<p>Sending Additional Water Police　Japan has also sent a large number of water police officers to Shanghai to establish a water police team attached to the Japanese</p>
<p>Consulate, which is also a way to strengthen its power in Shanghai. A total of nearly 20 police officers who were transferred from the Nagasaki and Kobe water police stations arrived in Shanghai yesterday to report for duty, including Yoshii, Suenaga, Hachiyan, Nakai, Mizuta, and Kiyose. The police officers will be sent one after another.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Public Concession Lifts Martial Law <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Implemented on June 13th</p>
<p>The Public Concession's Municipal Council announced that the martial law measures announced since January 28th of this year will be terminated from June 13th,</p>
<p>that is, next Monday, at 6:00 AM.</p>
<p>Strike by Telephone Workers in the Concession</p>
<h3 id="e152">The Situation Is Becoming More Serious <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Because the Company Did Not Provide a Concrete Reply Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>And Arrested Four Worker Representatives</p>
<p>Meeting at the Public Sports Ground Also Failed</p>
<p>After the strike by the telephone company workers in the Concession, the company still did not provide a concrete reply to the new conditions proposed by the workers yesterday. The representatives were arrested by the police, the Fujian Road branch was temporarily placed under martial law, and the meeting of workers at the Public Sports Ground was also stopped by the Public Security Bureau. The strike situation is becoming more serious. Details of the various events are recorded below:</p>
<p>Temporary Martial Law　The Public Concession Police, having received reports that the striking telephone company workers had gathered at the Fujian Road telephone branch at 7:00 AM on the 10th, under the orders of the Strike Committee, dispatched over a hundred Chinese and foreign armed detectives to temporarily impose martial law at 6:30 AM yesterday morning. They advised pedestrians standing by the roadside to disperse. By around 7:00 AM, striking workers came in groups of three or five and stood by the roadside waiting for news of the company's reply. By around 9:00 AM, over a thousand people had gathered, causing traffic to be blocked. The detectives tried to restore traffic, but the striking workers and onlookers remained.</p>
<p>Negotiations Ineffective　By 10:10 AM, all the workers, seeing that the company had not yet come out to reply to the conditions they had proposed, sent four representatives, Ye Gongzhao, Zheng Luojie, Xu Shijie, and Pan Dingquan, to the Fujian Road telephone branch to request an audience with the manager. They were met by the engineer Wilson, who told the representatives that the conditions proposed by the workers were in Chinese and were currently being translated into English, but the translation had not yet been completed, so a reply could not be given temporarily. A reply would be given after the translation was completed. The representatives believed that the company was not sincere in accepting the conditions and left together.</p>
<p>Representatives Arrested　After the representatives left, they announced the outcome of the negotiations to the workers waiting for news by the roadside. All the workers were very angry and shouted slogans such as "Oppose the company firing workers!", "We will not resume work until we achieve our goals!", "Support the Strike Committee!", which caused some disorder. The Chinese and foreign detectives immediately intervened and</p>
<p>arrested all the worker representatives Ye Gongzhao, workers Wan Ruichun, Zhang Rongsheng, and Zhu Ziwun, and dispersed the workers standing by the roadside.</p>
<p>Meeting Stopped　After all the striking workers were dispersed by the police, they immediately followed the Strike Committee's temporary urgent order and went to the Public Sports Ground in Ximen to hold a general meeting to discuss the next steps. By around 11:00 AM, over 400 workers had gathered at the Public Sports Ground and distributed the second declaration. When the meeting was about to begin, the Second Police Station of the Municipal Public Security Bureau sent police officers to inquire, claiming that the meeting had not been permitted by the Public Security Bureau, the Social Affairs Bureau, or the Municipal Party Headquarters, and advised them to stop. After the workers repeatedly negotiated with the police officers without success, the Second Police Station sent more police officers to disperse them at around 12:00 PM because the workers had not dispersed. The workers had no choice but to disperse.</p>
<p>Reception for Reporters　The Strike Committee sent letters to various newspapers and news agencies yesterday morning, saying, "We are writing to inform you that, in order to allow all sectors to understand the truth of the strike, the workers have decided to host reporters from various newspapers at 10:00 AM on the 10th at the Huzhongtian Teahouse on Fujian Road. We hope that your newspaper will send someone to participate on time." At 10:00 AM, reporters from various newspapers and news agencies went there,</p>
<p>just as the workers were shouting slogans. Because the representatives were arrested, the reception for reporters was postponed.</p>
<p>Workers' Attitude　The Strike Committee told reporters yesterday about the truth of the strike, saying that the motive of this strike is first to seek self-protection and second to oppose the unreasonable oppression of capitalists. The workers are acting entirely on their own and will not be disunited by the company's rumors.</p>
<p>The company has issued statements and announcements to try to undermine the workers, but this has only made the workers even more angry. The company is now showing no sincerity in the conditions proposed by the workers and is making excuses to delay. But all our workers will continue to strike until we achieve our goals. Our contact point with all sectors is the Tongshang Hotel on Avenue Road, the Shanghai Telephone Workers Strike Committee Contact Point.</p>

Now that the affairs of Shanghai have come to an end, and his responsibilities are lighter, he has prepared some dishes today to have a brief chat with everyone. There are many old friends in the audience today, and also many new acquaintances. It is truly a pleasure to have a good chat on this occasion.

<h3 id="e170">Inviting the Press to Pay Respects to the War Zone <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Heroic War Achievements</p>
<p>Desolate Scenery</p>
<p>The China Travel Service at 114 Sichuan Road, in view of the fact that the 19th Route Army's anti-Japanese operations in Shanghai this time brought glory to our nation and were of great significance, has organized a war zone visitation group.</p>
<p>In order to allow citizens to visit the important war relics in Wusong, Jiangwan, and Zhabei districts in the most economical time and at the most economical cost, since the 3rd of this month, the number of visitors to the war zone has been 500 per day. Yesterday, Chen Xiangtao, the president of the company, specially invited the Shanghai press to conduct a half-day inspection. At 1:30 PM, they departed from the front of the head office. More than ten representatives from various newspapers participated, riding in four new-style cars provided by the Liyi Automobile Company, which were stable, fast, and comfortable, and most suitable for observation. Along the way, inspectors from the travel agency, Hu Shiyuan, and Deng Bingquan, the director of the navigation department, accompanied them. They departed from Sichuan Road and went straight to Wusong and Paotaiwan. Along the way, they passed through Hongkou Park, West Sports Association Road, Chizhi University, Xiangyin Road, Xuzhi Company, Fudan University, Jungong Road, Water and Electricity Plant, Junpu Bureau, Yunzaohong, Wusong Town, Seaside Hotel, Meteorological Station, and Radio Station. After arriving at Paotaiwan, they visited the relics of the fort. More than ten cannons were all destroyed by the enemy army. The foundations of the fort were bombarded by enemy aircraft and artillery and were all shattered. Huge rocks were thrown dozens of feet away. Those who saw this situation could not help but sigh with sorrow. They paid respects at the fort, took photos for commemoration, and left Wusong at 3:45 PM.</p>
<p>They still went from Jungong Road to Xiangyin Road and got off the bus at the Xuzhi Company to rest briefly and have some snacks. They also visited the disinfection room and cattle barn, etc. The equipment was complete and the products were excellent. It was the leader of large-scale dairy farms run by the Chinese. At around 5 o'clock, they returned to Shanghai via Jiangwan Road. They passed through Tengpei Road, West Sports Association Road, Tongji Road, Baziqiao, Qingyun Road, Tiantong'an Railway Station, Japanese Naval Headquarters, North Sichuan Road, Dongbaoxing Road, Baoshan Road, Commercial Press, Oriental Library, and North Railway Station, and returned to the travel agency. What they saw along the way was broken walls and scorched earth, a scene of desolation. Especially the areas around Baziqiao and Baoshan Road suffered even more severely. The fierceness of the 19th Route Army's resistance at that time can be imagined. The war zone visitation group departs twice a day, the first shift at 8:30 AM, and the second shift at 1:30 PM. The fare is two yuan and two jiao per person, and the round trip takes about four and a half hours. Those who want to visit the war zone ruins with economical time should consider this route as the most suitable.</p>

The association specially sent a letter to the British Shanghai Waterworks Company yesterday, requesting that it imitate the method of reducing and exempting municipal general donations (ie, police donations) by the Public Concession, and give reductions and exemptions separately. At the same time, it sent letters to the Public Concession, requesting that it inform the Waterworks Company to investigate and handle the matter fairly, it is said.</p>

<p>Request for Exemption from Wine Tax for One Quarter</p>
<p>Meeting Scheduled for the 12th to Discuss</p>
<p>Since the January 28th Incident, the entire business of the Hongkou District was completely suspended. It was not until May 1st that it was barely able to open for business. Business was suspended for more than three months, resulting in huge direct and indirect losses. The Chinese Taxpayers Association has requested the Public Concession to exempt the police donation, etc. Now the wine industry has followed suit and requested to be exempted from the wine tax for one quarter. The Soy Sauce and Wine Industry Association of the Chinese Taxpayers Association has sent a letter to the Public Concession for negotiations, but no official reply has been received so far. However, regarding how to proceed, it is said that the soy sauce and wine industry has decided to convene a meeting of soy sauce and wine colleagues in the Hongkou District at 2 PM on the 12th of this month in the Soy Sauce and Wine Industry Association in the City God Temple to discuss the way forward.</p>

<h3 id="e185">Wang Sheng Rong Case <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Wang Sheng Rong is married to a Mr. Wang from Suzhou and is the granddaughter of Sheng Yu Zhai, a prominent official from the previous Qing dynasty, the biological daughter of Sheng Kui Chen, and the adopted daughter of Sheng Ai Chen. After Ai Chen's death, Yu You, the son of Ze Chen, was adopted as his heir. After Yu Zhai's death, Wang Sheng Rong, based on the equal rights of children law, filed a lawsuit with the First Special District Court against Yu You to equally divide the inheritance. Subsequently, due to identity issues, the case was to be determined by the High Court. In the 16th year of the Republic, Yu Zhai's wife, Zhuang, also passed away, leaving a will distributing 75,000 yuan to Ai Chen's name (i.e., Yu You inherited). Therefore, the property was not equally divided with Wang Sheng Rong. For this reason, she filed another lawsuit with the First Special District Court to equally divide 37,500 yuan. Yesterday was the date for the review, and Judge Li Hu presided over the hearing in the Seventh Civil Court. First, Wang Sheng Rong provided a detailed account of her identity, stating:</p>
<p>When Grandpa Yu Zhai was alive, he was very fond of me and I attended to him closely, sharing his meals and rest. After Yu Zhai's death, I continued to rely on my grandmother Zhuang, and Ai Chen also loved me very much. Moreover, Wang Sheng Rong's biological father had passed away early, so Ai Chen adopted me as his daughter, treating me as his own. When Ai Chen was on his deathbed, I personally attended to his medicine, and after his death, I wore mourning attire. Everything a filial child should do, I did to the fullest. One week after Ai Chen's death, my grandmother Zhuang established Yu You as Ai Chen's heir. This was because Ai Chen's wife had passed away early and he never remarried, and later only had a concubine as his wife, but she had no children either. After her grandmother Zhuang passed away, she divided 75,000 yuan of her estate to Ai Chen's heir, Yu You. Because Ai Chen had already adopted Wang Sheng Rong as his daughter, she has the right to request half of it. As for why I also sued Sheng Ze Chen, it is because Yu You's property is currently entirely managed by him. The defendant did not appear, and lawyer Jiang Bao Li represented him, stating that this case is similar to the previous lawsuit to equally divide Yu Zhai's inheritance. The only difference is that</p>
<p>it involves the inheritance of the grandmother instead of the grandfather. Now that the previous case has been suspended for deliberation due to Wang Sheng Rong's identity issue, and she is still awaiting a clarification of her identity in the High Court, it seems that the proceedings in this case should also be suspended to avoid conflicting judgments in the future. The plaintiff's lawyer, Li Zu Yu, then rose to object, stating that when Wang Sheng Rong got married, Ai Chen handled everything as if she were his own daughter, and there are as many as sixteen pieces of evidence to prove her adoption. Because witnesses still need to be summoned, the hearing was rescheduled for a later date.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Shao Yun Peng Case <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Shao Yun Peng, Yun Zhi, Yun Jun, Yun Qi, Yun Lin, and Yun Xiang are born to Zhi Hui, the biological daughter of Sheng Gong Bao from the previous Qing dynasty. In the 16th year of the Republic, Gong Bao's wife, Zhuang, passed away, leaving a large inheritance. It was not until November 2nd of last year that the will was discovered, stating that the fourth, fifth, sixth, and eighth daughters should each receive 10,000 yuan. A Mr. Lin Feng Wen, with the qualification of a maternal grandson, requested the First Special District Court, on the grounds that women have inheritance rights, to equally divide the inheritance as the daughter of Gong Bao, and accused Sheng Ze Cheng, Pan Chen, Jian Chen, Yu Chang, Yu You, Guan Yi, Fang Yi, Ai Yi, and Jing Yi of embezzlement. The Sheng family therefore filed a counterclaim for false accusation, and the case was dismissed. Therefore, the authenticity of the will became an issue. This will was only discovered several years after Zhuang's death, raising many doubts. For this reason, Shao Yun Peng and others also commissioned lawyer Dong Yu to file a complaint with the First Special District Court, accusing the Sheng family brothers and sisters of forging the will and embezzling the inheritance. This case had been heard, but the preliminary trial judge recused himself for some reason. Yesterday, Judge Shen Bing Rong continued the trial. The most important point in this case is whether the will is genuine, when it was made, and how it was discovered. The Sheng family brothers and sisters then presented Shen Yi Qing, who wrote the will, and Li Pu Cheng and Zhuang Feng Ying, who were present at the time, as witnesses. Shen Yi Qing testified that he was the person who drafted and transcribed the will. It was written after Zhuang's sixtieth birthday. Because Zhuang felt that lawsuits had arisen after the death of Gong Bao's concubine, she wrote the will to avoid disputes after her death and to resolve lawsuits. When it was written, Li Pu Cheng and Zhuang Feng Ying were present. It was after dinner, and Zhuang dictated while Shen Yi Qing drafted and then transcribed it. After Zhuang read it, she stamped it with her seal. However, Zhuang specifically instructed that the will must not be made known to her children and grandchildren until after her death and funeral arrangements were completed. It must be kept secret during her lifetime. When questioned, Li Pu Cheng and Zhuang Feng Ying gave similar testimony. However, Judge Shen said to the witnesses, "It is fortunate that this will was discovered last year. If it had been unfortunately lost forever, would Zhuang's painstaking efforts have been in vain? Therefore, the three people who were present when the will was written did not announce it immediately after Zhuang's death. Did they also fail Zhuang's intentions on that day?" The three witnesses said, "If this will had been unfortunately lost, we would have definitely mentioned Zhuang's intentions when the property was divided." Because the plaintiff mistakenly believed that the judge had recused himself from the hearing, or perhaps the hearing had been changed, the plaintiffs did not appear in court. The court ordered the hearing to be rescheduled to summon them again.</p>

<p>Shaanxi Relief Association's telegram to Zhu Qing Lan says, Zhu Ziqiao, Director, No. 1 Jiujiang Road, Shanghai, greetings. Since spring, Shaanxi Province has reported black frost, gale, hail, and drought disasters in more than seventy counties. Hoping that the remaining seedlings may yield a harvest, unexpectedly, when the wheat was about to ripen, there was another prolonged drought and gale, causing the ears to wither and few grains to form. Unified inspection showed that the yield was less than one-tenth or two-tenths. There will be no summer harvest, and the autumn harvest is still far away. Alas, how will our disaster-stricken people survive? Currently, requests for relief are continuous and overwhelming, making it impossible to cope. I humbly request that you, being kind and benevolent, pity the remnants of the people who have suffered from disasters, and kindly extend a helping hand to help them survive. A special telegram is sent appealing for your pity and compassion. The Shaanxi Provincial Relief Association bows and sends its regards.</p>

<h3 id="e196">The Moustache Issue of "Night Blooming Flower" <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>One of the Bandits in a Kidnapping Case</p>
<p>Lawyer Raises a Clever Argument</p>
<p>Hu Yun Qing, a famous gangster nicknamed "Night Blooming Flower" from Changzhou, was involved in a case where Cai Fu Lin, a comprador for the British American Tobacco Company, was kidnapped by bandits years ago and released after his family paid a large ransom. After the case was investigated and punished, he fled to other places to hide. Recently, he was discovered by detectives from the Jiangyin Public Security Bureau at the Tian Xian Tea Garden in the county. They notified the General Inspectorate of the Public Concession, and Chief Detective Lu Lian Kui sent Detective Feng Zhi Ming to Cheng to bring him to Shanghai. He was handed over to the First Special District Court. After interrogation, he admitted that he had received 1,000 yuan of the ransom money. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shi De proposed to continue the trial. Although the defendant Hu Yun Qing was repeatedly questioned by Judge Feng, he only insisted that he was innocent and had nothing else to say. When questioned again, he overturned his previous admission in court that he had received 1,000 yuan of the ransom money. His lawyer then made a humorous request, stating that the victim Cai Fu Lin and his wife had previously testified that the bandit who contacted them did not have a moustache, but the defendant's lips now have a mustache. Therefore, to examine his face, it would be best to allow the defendant to shave off his beard and call Cai's wife to court again to identify him, in order to be prudent. Originally, to identify a face, it must be white and without a beard in order to recognize the true face of Mount Lu. Therefore, the defendant's beard is of great importance and should be noted. For a moment, the audience, hearing the lawyer's clever argument, laughed. However, Judge Feng said that even if the defendant has a beard, his face would not be completely changed by the beard. The request to shave his beard is unnecessary, so he did not approve the request and immediately ordered the debate to begin. The police lawyer Wang Yao Tang and the defendant's three defense lawyers then debated in turn. It was already past noon. Judge Feng ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and await sentencing at a later date.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Stealing Blank Checks from a Shop <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>Filling Out 300 Yuan and Cashing It</p>
<p>Zhao A Qiao from Shaoxing used to work as a shop assistant at Cun Ji Ren Yang Qian Zhuang at No. 33 Huangpu Road. He quit during the war and became unemployed. His courtyard was empty and he could not maintain his livelihood. On the 16th of last month at about 6 p.m., he sneaked into the shop's accounting room and stole a bankbook and a blank check for 300 yuan, filled it out, and cashed it at a bank on Ningbo Road the next day. He took the money back to his hometown. The Chinese manager of the Qian Zhuang, Fu Xiang Qing, found out, reported it to the Hongkou police for arrest. The other day, Zhao A Qiao came to Shanghai from his hometown and hid in a house at No. 13 Dexing Lane, Haining Road. Hua Detective Zhang Shou Shan discovered this secretly and arrested him and took him to the police station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special Court's High Court. The police lawyer Zhang Tian Yin stated the previous situation and presented the check filled out by Zhao A Qiao. The manager of Qian Zhuang, Fu Xiang Qing, sent a representative to the court and reported the incident in detail. When questioned, the defendant admitted it without denial, saying that the check was written by someone surnamed Jia who set up a fortune-telling stall at the old garbage bridge. He hid 200 yuan of the money in his hometown and had already told the plaintiff to send someone to get it. He had used up 100 yuan. He threw the bankbook back into the accounting room from the window on the afternoon of the 17th of last month, etc., seeking consideration. Judge Shen Yun Rong ordered him to be remanded in custody for a later hearing.</p>

<p>She Just Returned to Shanghai from Hangzhou the Other Day</p>
<p>Plainclothes Detectives Waited at the Station and Followed Her Before Arresting Her</p>
<p>Wang A Mei, a 17-year-old woman from Suzhou, was induced by Shen Chuan Shi to have intercourse with Wang Zuo Fa for two nights at a hotel in the French Concession. Afterwards, they rented a house at No. 447 Jin Shen Fu Road. Wang A Mei took the opportunity to escape and her parents reported it to the police. Initially, Shen Fu Shi, who lived at No. 265 Macau Road, was arrested. The next day, plainclothes detectives took the girl on a car ride around the streets and she identified the place where she lived. Wang was arrested. The details were reported in the previous newspaper. It turned out that there was also a woman named Wu Si Yu from Jinhua, who was a major figure in the case. Therefore, the police searched for her very strictly. They recently learned that Wu Si Yu was hiding in Hangzhou and returned to Shanghai the other day. The detectives waited at the station. At 5 p.m. the other day, when the train from Hangzhou arrived in Shanghai, they saw her arriving. Because the area belonged to the Chinese territory, the detectives followed her to the area of Gordon Road and Putuo Road, arrested her, and sent her to the First Special Court yesterday. First, Wang A Mei said that she and Wu Si Yu were originally living together. After the Shanghai war started, Wu escaped to other places. When she returned, she lived at No. 265 Macau Road. On the 23rd, she passed by and was led in by her, who claimed that working in a yarn factory was not as good as going to a silk factory and lured her to stay at her house temporarily, without having to return, and without having to inform her parents. In the evening, she took her out and met Wang Zuo Fa at the Great World, who forced her to go to a hotel and had intercourse with her for two nights. Wu even stayed with her at the hotel on the first night. Afterwards, they rented a house and lived together, and then she escaped. When questioned, Wu Si Yu denied everything and said that it was Wang A Mei who took the initiative to live with her. Because this case needs to be tried together, it was decided to try them together today.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Uniform Date for Changing Gas Station Licenses <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>Announcement by the Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau, Finance Bureau, and Public Works Bureau: In order to make an announcement, it is found that Article 16 of the Shanghai Municipal Regulations for the Management of Automobile Gas Stations states, "The business license of an automobile gas station shall be valid for a period of one year. Upon expiration, a new license shall be exchanged, and a license exchange fee of two silver dollars shall be paid." Furthermore, Article 17, Paragraph 3, states, "If the business license has expired and is still used without being exchanged, a fine of ten dollars shall be imposed, and a license shall still be exchanged." Therefore, the licenses of all automobile gas stations should be exchanged every year from the date of issuance. If the deadline is exceeded, a penalty will be imposed. However, because the issuance times are staggered, the exchange deadlines are not uniform. It is difficult for each station to remember, and the Bureau also finds it troublesome to issue them piecemeal and urge them separately. Therefore, we have followed the precedent of water pipe merchants and electrical material stores, reported to the Municipal Government, and uniformly set the exchange date. All automobile gas station licenses are changed to be issued between July 1st and July 31st of each year, which will be implemented from July 1st of this year. This is announced to the public. This announcement is made on June 9th, 21st year of the Republic of China, by Cai Zeng Ji, Director of the Finance Bureau, Jin Li Ren, Director of the Land Bureau, and Huang Bo Qiao, Director of the Public Works Bureau.</p>

<p>The Maid is Returning to Her Hometown This Time</p>
<p>Huang Qian Huan, a native of Luoding County, Guangdong Province, with the courtesy name Chang Shu, used to work in the military department and has recently been unemployed. He brought his wife, Huang Tan, aged 24, and a maid, Pan Qin, aged 13, to live in Shanghai at No. 24 Guangtai Lai Hotel, Edouard Road, French Concession. Tan recently abused the maid, Pan Qin. On the 8th of this month, she used a chicken feather duster to severely beat the girl, causing bruises on her back, buttocks, and arms. The girl, unable to bear the suffering, stole 15 silver dollars when the Huang couple went out that evening, intending to take a boat back to her hometown alone. Because she did not know the way, she walked to the New Sun rooftop on Nanjing Road and was still wandering there at 12 o'clock that night. Patrolmen 893 and 779 of the Lao Zha Patrol Station found her and suspected her. They took her to the patrol station. After questioning by the patrol chief, because the incident occurred in the French Concession, they sent a detective to the French Patrol Station. After questioning by the patrol chief, Detective Ding Wen Sheng confirmed the facts and summoned Tan to the Second Special Court yesterday. Judge Zhang tried the case. Police lawyer Fei Xi Zhen stated the case, saying that the defendant's abuse of her granddaughter was obvious. The police prosecuted her under Article 293 of the Criminal Law and requested a trial. However, because the girl was beaten, she did not want to go back with the defendant and requested to be sent to the Tongxiang Association to be sent back to her hometown and handed over to her parents. The girl, Pan Qin, also testified that she was injured by the defendant. Tan, who is from Guangdong and does not speak the Shanghai dialect, was questioned and her husband came to court to testify on her behalf, saying that the girl did not do her job well and had stolen a wallet from a co-tenant the other day, so she was beaten. His wife found out and scolded and beat her. But the child is the daughter of a relative of my uncle and was given to me to adopt because her family was poor. It has been six years. Please hand her back. After verifying the confession in court, the court sentenced Huang Tan to a fine of 30 yuan for injuring someone, and if she was unable to pay the fine, she would be imprisoned for one day for every two yuan. The victim, Pan Qin, will be temporarily held at the patrol station and sent back to her hometown of Luoding County, Guangdong Province, by the Guangdong Tongxiang Association.</p>

<p>To the esteemed editor of the Shen Bao newspaper:</p>
<p>Regarding the news item in yesterday's "Local News" column titled "French Violinist to Perform in Shanghai," it was mentioned that the violinist was invited to Shanghai by our theater. This is not accurate. The management of our theater did not actively invite any musicians to Shanghai. Ms. "Lanner Sheme" was hired by Orienta Muaslcal Cureau and plans to perform at our theater.</p>
<p>We hereby request a correction to be published in the "Letters to the Editor" column.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>To the esteemed editor of the Shen Bao newspaper:</p>
<p>According to the Shishi Xinbao newspaper, today's Shen Bao, Xinwen Bao, and Shibao all carried a news item titled "Aftermath of the Newspaper Workers' Strike Yesterday," along with a declaration from the Newspaper Workers' Union. The wording contains many inaccuracies.</p>
<p>On June 2nd, our newspaper's typesetting room was suddenly destroyed by thugs. One person, Zhang Zhuming, was arrested at the scene. After interrogation by the police, he confessed the names of his accomplices. In addition to He Zhaoxiong and three others, the rest are in hiding. On the 8th, it was discovered that these individuals were hiding in a house on Xiaotaoyuan Street in the Chinese area, still holding secret meetings and plotting to harm our newspaper.</p>
<p>To prevent any danger, our newspaper requested the Public Security Bureau to arrest and investigate them by name. In addition to arresting the defendants who jointly destroyed our newspaper's typesetting room, no damage was done to the equipment and miscellaneous items in the house. The statement in Shen Bao and other newspapers about the destruction of union equipment and miscellaneous items is fabricated and misleading. Moreover, those arrested are all co-defendants who harmed our newspaper, and there are confessions from the arrested defendants and witness testimonies on file. This is entirely a criminal matter and has nothing to do with the labor strike issue. Whether or not a crime is established will be determined by the court according to the law, which we will not elaborate on.</p>
<p>The news reported by Shen Bao and other newspapers is clearly inconsistent with the facts. We request that your lawyers send a letter to make a correction immediately.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Lawyer Cha Renwei</p>

<p>To the esteemed editor of the Shen Bao newspaper:</p>
<p>I read in the newspaper yesterday about a Beijing dispatch stating that our lawyer was denied registration by the Ningbo Bar Association and cannot appear in court to defend Niu Lan. This case has been accepted by the High Court. Any lawyer registered with the High Court can appear in court, without being restricted by the designated district court area in the Lawyers' Regulations. Even if the case is tried in the Ningbo District Court in the future, it will still be considered a High Court case, not a District Court case. Therefore, since the prosecutor filed the lawsuit with the High Court, the High Court has also specially appointed a judge to go to Beijing to appear in court, which has nothing to do with the Ningbo Court. Our lawyer has been notified by the High Court to set a date and will go to review the files, indicating that there is no inability to perform his duties. The newspaper's report is likely based on inaccurate information.</p>
<p>We have received many inquiries from various circles and have not had time to answer them one by one. We kindly request that you publish this letter in your newspaper to correct the misunderstanding. We would be very grateful.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Lawyer Chen Ying</p>

<p>To the esteemed editor of the Shen Bao newspaper:</p>
<p>According to Feng Wantong Sauce Garden, they were surprised to see a news item in your newspaper on the 7th of this month about Feng Wantong voluntarily reducing rent. Upon investigation, the garden's leased premises on Dongmen Road from Feng Sanletang have not had any voluntary rent reduction. The information in your newspaper is inaccurate.</p>
<p>We have been entrusted by this lawyer to send a letter requesting a correction. Therefore, we are sending this letter on their behalf, urging your newspaper to promptly make a correction to avoid spreading misinformation.</p>

<h3 id="e213">Jiangsu Province Three-Year Construction Plan (Continued) <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>Regarding highways, telecommunications, and provincial capital construction, the Jiangsu Provincial Highway Bureau was originally established to be responsible for the construction of provincial and county roads. The Jiangsu Provincial Telecommunications Management Office was originally established to be responsible for the management of electricity and telecommunications throughout the province. The Jiangsu Provincial Capital Construction Committee was originally established, later reduced to the Provincial Capital Construction Engineering Office, to be responsible for all construction in the provincial capital. In the winter of the 20th year, all of the above-mentioned original institutions were abolished and merged into this department for division management. The reason for the changes was to reduce government spending, and this consolidation was unavoidable. Although the difficulties in future progress were known, they could not be considered. The previous organizational structure of each bureau and office shared the responsibility of implementation, and this department only stood in a guiding and supervisory position. The current organizational structure places all implementation responsibilities in the supervisory body. Those who previously shared the work are now solely responsible. However, given the current financial constraints and tense situation, it is impossible to restore the original state. Since the responsibility lies with one body, all measures must be carried out diligently.</p>
<p>Now, regarding the completed projects of previous administrations, the projects that have been started but not completed, the projects that have been planned but not yet started, and the projects that have not been planned but still need to be designed, I dare to supplement them as much as possible within my ability and strive to complete the final three years of the tutelage period. Whether or not the goal can be achieved is uncertain, but I aim to work hard and advance bravely. All projects are divided by year and compiled separately later. Among them, water conservancy is particularly emphasized. Jiangsu Province is adjacent to the Yellow Sea to the east, connected to Huai, Mu, Yi, and Si to the north, and traversed by the Yangtze River in the middle. As for the Grand Canal, it connects to Shao, Bao, and Hongze lakes. More than twenty counties in Jiangbei turn into swamps whenever there is excessive rainfall. The sea dikes in Jiangnan are also of paramount importance. Last year's flood caused the simultaneous breach of the Grand Canal and sea dikes, resulting in countless injuries to people, farmlands, property, and livestock. Dikes everywhere were destroyed, which significantly impacted people's livelihoods. It is essential to know that to seek construction, people's livelihood must be the prerequisite. To solve the problem of people's livelihood, water conservancy must be revitalized. In this three-year plan, special attention is paid to water conservancy projects, which are listed as the top priority, followed by other projects. These projects will be carried out separately within these three years. Government officials will initiate at the front, and the public will assist at the rear. With everyone working together, success will be easy to achieve.</p>
<p>However, managing projects depends on sufficient funding. Jiangsu Province's special construction funds include road construction land tax, water conservancy land tax, special construction tax, and construction funds, totaling no less than three million yuan annually. At first glance, it may not seem small, but the actual annual revenue is often less than half of that. Examining the reasons, it may be due to reduced harvests, with surcharges decreasing along with the regular tax. Or it may be due to local financial difficulties, with construction funds being diverted for other purposes. Furthermore, the agencies responsible for collecting these special funds do not allocate them as they are collected, but rather accumulate them over time, making reform difficult. All of these factors have a significant impact on construction projects. Thorough rectification should be carried out in the future so that all facilities can be completed on schedule. Moreover, according to this plan, the various expenses cannot be met by a small number of special funds. It is essential to find new sources of income to achieve the desired effect.</p>
<p>Jiangsu Province has issued construction bonds to supplement the shortage of funds for various projects, with regular lotteries and a good reputation. The remaining face value is limited, but the annual project costs, based on the established plans, vary greatly. Therefore, it is necessary to continue issuing these bonds. As for the subsequent bond fund, it is proposed to collect from the beneficiaries or designate existing revenue to address the urgent needs, so that small amounts can be consolidated into a whole. This plan should still be carefully considered in conjunction with the competent financial authorities to avoid the disadvantages of harming the people and disturbing businesses while promoting construction. Moreover, there are benefits to promoting bonds for construction projects. For example, with the revitalization of water conservancy, disasters can be avoided, and harvests can be abundant. With the completion of highways, the networks will be connected, and transportation will be convenient. With the development of the telecommunications industry, all news can be transmitted quickly and without delay. With the prosperity of municipal administration, all facilities can be improved without being criticized for being simple. People can maximize their talents, land can maximize its benefits, things can maximize their use, and goods can flow smoothly. With the expansion of the effects of construction, the hopes of the people can be comforted, and the benefits of bonds will become apparent.</p>
<p>As for the standard for subsequent bond issuance, it will be based on the progress of the project, and the timely progress of the project depends on the bond funds as a very important foundation. Only then can this great construction be completed. Everything has rights and obligations. Purchasing bonds is an obligation, and rights are inherent in obligations. To seek the ultimate rights while avoiding the obligations beforehand is impossible. Therefore, construction bonds rely on the public's enthusiastic purchase, and government officials do their best to promote sales, working together for the future happiness of Jiangsu Province.</p>
<p>Furthermore, after the abolition of Likin duties, the associated construction revenue has been reduced by tens of thousands of yuan annually. Since Jiangsu Province has implemented a business tax to compensate for the lack of abolition, the construction sector should propose a percentage of the annual income to compensate for the removed surcharges. On one hand, the long-distance bus road maintenance fees for various roads should be reorganized, and the completed roads throughout the province should be opened to attract merchants to operate vehicles, thereby increasing the income from road maintenance fees. For the unfinished provincial and county roads, it is proposed to selectively contract merchants to build them and grant them the right to operate vehicles for a limited period. The above points take from the people for the benefit of the people, without being contradictory or involving excessive burden. As for the various minor surcharges, it is not appropriate to burden our people again. This is a brief summary of the financial aspects, presented at the end. It is hoped that the gentlemen of the country will understand together. I respectfully state the main points and hope for clear guidance.</p>

<p>— Cimin</p>
<p>Below a horizontal line, there are the following two brief telegrams:</p>
<p>(1) "Songxia, accompanied by six or seven armed soldiers, met with ××× and questioned him about the External Affairs Ministry's protest against the Japanese army firing live ammunition in Yu and the bullet landing in the city. He also demanded × prove that the Japanese army did not fire live ammunition in Yu. × did not reply."</p>
<p>(2) "The vanguard of the Guizhou army entering Guangdong from Huaiji has reached the border of Guangning and Sihui. ××× ordered ××× to build an airfield in Beihai Dianbai to prepare to send aircraft to Nanlu. ×××'s unit, under the order of ×××, was transferred from Beijiang to the province and then to Nanlu; conscription has been extremely busy in the Guangsan Road area in recent days."</p>
<p>The first one is that the Japanese army asked a certain × to provide proof, but he did not reply. This is so secret and mysterious, as soft and elastic as cotton wool! The second one is strung together with words like Guizhou army...vanguard...prepare...send...</p>
<p>transfer...aircraft...conscription. This is so straightforward and obvious, as hard and decisive as pig iron!</p>
<p>The three words "did not reply" have erased so many facts. Is it "ignoring"? Or "tacitly agreeing"? Or "understanding"? I dare not speculate.</p>
<p>The actions of "sending...transferring...vanguard...conscription" are truly busy and tense. Is it "suppressing bandits"? Or "fighting our own people"? Or taking revenge on an "irreconcilable enemy"? I dare not guess.</p>
<p>But, within the same territory of our country, and both being military officers commanding troops, the performance is clearly one "negative" and one "positive". Who wouldn't believe it?</p>
<p>Someone might say, "Haven't you studied the materialistic dialectic of the times? This is called 'the unity of opposites'."</p>

<p>— Songlu</p>
<p>The January 28th Incident, with people killed in the fields, blood flowing in the ditches, and the magnitude of the losses unprecedented, caused me to witness with a wounded heart, and grief and indignation had no outlet. I once wrote 30 poems to record the events. Now that the peace treaty has been signed, after the pain subsides, I feel even more emotional. I have extracted ten poems and submitted them to this publication to elicit sympathetic tears.</p>
<p>Without warning, the war clouds opened, and the sound of cannons roared like thunder all night. At dawn, putting on clothes, the crowd was shocked and asked, "Millions of elite troops have turned to ashes."</p>
<p>Outside the city of Liaoyang, corpses are still piled up, and on the banks of the Huangpu River, blood flows again. Before the great enemy, we must strive together, knowing that resistance to the enemy is our common cause.</p>
<p>Armored vehicles and cannons roamed day and night, and the Bao Tong Road was impassable. Generals fought bravely to die first, and one battle brought eternal fame.</p>
<p>Humiliatingly seeking peace is still unavoidable. How can we build meritorious achievements through bloody battles? One blow to the head frightens the Japanese, and the 19th Route Army is an iron army.</p>

<h3 id="e217">Coloring Method on Copper and Ironware <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Liufang</p>
<p>Household odds and ends are mostly made of copper and iron, because they are cheap and durable, but they are prone to rust and unsightly. If we can use chemical methods and the power of medicines to achieve various beautiful colors, then although copper and iron are crude and cheap, their appearance will be no different from that of precious metals. Now I will describe the various dyeing methods in detail below.</p>
<p>Method for Dyeing Silver Color on Copperware</p>
<p>Two mace of mercury, one mace of alum powder, one mace of mercuric oxide.</p>
<p>Grind the above three ingredients into a powder. First, polish the copperware, then rub it vigorously with this mixed powder, and its color will be no different from silver.</p>
<p>Method for Dyeing Golden Color on Copperware</p>
<p>Three to four taels of potash (i.e., alkali), two taels and four qian of white alum.</p>
<p>Dissolve the above two ingredients in three pounds of clear water, put the copperware in, simmer until boiling, take it out, and then wash it very clean with this water. Then rub it with fine chalk powder, and it will appear as a bright golden yellow.</p>
<p>Method for Dyeing Black Color on Copperware</p>
<p>One part of tin nitrate, two parts of gold chloride.</p>
<p>First polish the copperware with chalk powder, then immerse it in the solution of the above two medicines. After a quarter of an hour, take it out and wipe it dry with a clean cloth, and it will become black copper.</p>
<p>Method for Dyeing Dark Green Color on Copperware</p>
<p>One part of ferric chloride, two parts of clear water.</p>
<p>First, polish the copperware and immerse it in the above solution. The color intensity depends on the duration of immersion.</p>
<p>Method for Dyeing Brown Color on Copperware</p>
<p>One tael of copper sulfate, one tael of zinc chloride, two taels of clear water.</p>
<p>First, polish the copperware, apply the above solution to the piece, and slowly bake it over a low fire until the piece is completely dry.</p>
<p>Method for Dyeing Silver Color on Ironware</p>
<p>Four taels and five qian of dragon's blood, six qian and three fen of arsenic trioxide powder, two taels and four qian of ammonium chloride.</p>
<p>Put the above three ingredients into a container with four pounds of 90-degree alcohol, add appropriate heat, and shake it frequently until it is completely dissolved. Then, polish the ironware and apply this medicinal solution to the piece. After it dries, there will be a thin layer of silver color on the surface, which is not only beautiful but also rustproof.</p>
<p>Method for Dyeing Golden Color on Ironware</p>
<p>Fourteen parts of manganese nitrate, six parts of pure alcohol.</p>
<p>First, polish the ironware and slightly heat it over a low fire. Then, dip a sponge in the above solution and apply it to the piece. Wait until it is dry and apply it again, repeating three or four times, and it will appear as a bright golden color.</p>
<p>Method for Dyeing Black Color on Ironware</p>
<p>Seven parts of copper nitrate, three parts of pure alcohol.</p>
<p>First, polish the ironware and slightly heat it over a low fire. Then, take a brush, dip it in the above solution, and apply it to the piece. After cooling, a black copper oxide film will form on the piece. Peel it off by hand, and a carbon-colored substance will remain on the inner surface of the piece. Repeat this process several times, and it will become a glossy black metalware.</p>
<p>Method for Dyeing Brown Color on Ironware</p>
<p>Eight parts of ferric chloride, four parts of antimony chloride, two parts of tannic acid, eight parts of clear water.</p>
<p>First, polish, wash, and dry the ironware. Then, dip a sponge in the above solution and apply it to the piece, rubbing it vigorously. The color intensity depends on the number of times the solution is applied. When the color is appropriate, let it sit for a while, wash it clean with clear water, dry it, and then apply linseed oil to the piece.</p>
<p>Method for Dyeing Carbon Color on Ironware</p>
<p>One point and six fen of ammonium sulfite, six parts of clear water.</p>
<p>First, dye the ironware according to the procedure for dyeing golden color, then immerse it in the above solution and repeat it again and again until the desired color is obtained.</p>

<h3 id="e218">Please Call a Doctor <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Iwano</p>
<p>Mr. Li's little treasure, Xiong'er, was lively and smiling at lunchtime, but for some reason, he suddenly started crying and fussing two hours after the meal, unable to sit or lie down properly. His wife quickly called her husband back from school to discuss what to do.</p>
<p>When Mr. Li returned and saw Xiong'er's condition and felt his forehead and body, which were burning hot, he knew that the illness had come suddenly. His wife said, "Quickly call Dr. So-and-so to see him, don't hesitate, or the illness will worsen."</p>
<p>Mr. Li frowned and said, "Dr. So-and-so? He is indeed an expert in pediatrics, but it is afternoon now, and he only sees patients in the morning. The people said, "Then hurry up and ask him to come." Mr. Li said, "Ask him to come? We can't afford it, a house call costs eight yuan and eight jiao! Do we have that much money?" Mrs. Li was so anxious that she shed tears and said, "Dr. Wang in the front alley, I heard that he will come to see a patient anytime you ask him, as long as it is one yuan. Let's ask him to take a look first." Although Mr. Li did not want to delay with a mediocre doctor, he felt his pocket, and where would he get eight yuan and eight jiao? He had to listen to his wife and go to the front alley to invite Dr. Wang. As he went, he kept saying in his mouth, "The poor are sick, it is not good to be sick in the afternoon!"</p>
<p>After taking a dose of Dr. Wang's medicine, Xiong'er's condition not only did not improve but showed significant progress. They did not close their eyes all night. Xiong'er was uncomfortable, and they were even more uncomfortable in their hearts. At eight o'clock in the morning, they hurriedly took Xiong'er to the pediatrics expert. Who knew that many people had already arrived first? Mr. Li hurriedly took out one yuan and two jiao to register, but it was already number nineteen. He went to the examination room to take a look, but the doctor had not yet arrived. He saw that the clock had struck nine, and thought that the diagnosis would begin, but the doctor did not enter the examination room but went out and sat in a rickshaw. When he asked those who had registered, they said, "This is an early house call, someone invited him for eight yuan and eight jiao. The clinic here stipulates that it will not start until ten o'clock." When Mr. Li heard this, he could not help but repeat "eight yuan eight, eight yuan eight."</p>
<p>At ten o'clock, the diagnosis began, starting with number one. When it got to number eight, Mr. and Mrs. Li rejoiced, thinking that Xiong'er would be next in another hour. Just as they were watching number nine pass, suddenly number ten was skipped and a new arrival was seen. Mr. Li was about to ask why he did not follow the order and came from behind, when he suddenly thought that this was called "pulling the number," and that he had paid double the consultation fee to enjoy this priority. So he could not help but call out "two yuan four, two yuan four."</p>
<p>When it got to number eighteen, just as number eighteen stood up from the stool next to the doctor, Mr. Li hugged Xiong'er and wanted to go up to take his place when suddenly there was another "pull the number," another two yuan four jiao causing mischief and driving him aside. Mr. Li stood aside, worried that another two yuan four would come, but fortunately, this "pull the number" was pulled away, and it was his Xiong'er's turn. He was registered as number nineteen, but in fact, he was number twenty-one, and he could not return until 13:00 after arriving at 8:30.</p>
<p>On the way back, he patted Xiong'er and said, "Baby, it's not good to get sick in the future. If you get sick, don't get sick in the afternoon, because it costs eight yuan eight jiao!" And he gently patted him and said, "If you unfortunately get sick and go there, don't encounter 'pulling the number,' we can't 'pull,' because 'pulling' costs two yuan four jiao!"</p>

<p>— Shou</p>
<p>I often hear many people say that the more civilized humans become, the more they use their brains, so the lifespan of humans is getting shorter. From one point of view, it is certainly correct, but the general facts are not so. Look at the people in various countries around the world, they do not have shorter lifespans because of the progress of civilization, but rather they are getting younger and healthier as they get older. For example, Edison used his brain more severely than the average person, but he did not have a shorter lifespan because of it. Because they can see this danger, they pay twelve points of attention to eugenics and physical education, so that each body can develop a strong foundation, and then they bravely go forward to do it. Even if we take the people of the same race in Japan as an example, they have been able to keep pace with Europe and the United States and pay attention to this danger. Look at the newly formed cabinet in Japan this time, the oldest member is seventy-nine years old and the youngest is forty-nine years old. The average is almost sixty years old. People like this in their twilight years can still shoulder the heavy responsibility of the country and prepare to do something. How surprising is this kind of physique and spirit to us? But in the mouths of the Chinese, it is "Old but not dead, called a thief."</p>
<p>On the other hand, the people in the country are not like that. In the past fifty years, they have also learned some superficial civilization, but they have also used their brains a lot, but unfortunately they have used them in the wrong way, specializing in selfishness and benefiting themselves at the expense of others. At the same time, they do not pay attention to eugenics and physical education, resulting in a group of sickly young people. May I ask whether this kind of people can live long, whether they can have the courage to move forward. As for the elderly, once they are over fifty years old, they do not want to continue working, and they retire into the forest. This is called "enjoying happiness." Even if you want to do it, people will say that you are old and mediocre and have entered the ranks of being overthrown. Therefore, I often hear the older generation say, "Each generation is worse than the last!"</p>
