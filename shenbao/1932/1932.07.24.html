<h3 id="c1">畸形發展之生產與消費彬 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>生產與消費二者必得其平衡生產超過消费是爲（過剩）消費超過生。產則爲（貧乏。）在資本主義之社會。過剩與貧乏皆足以激起經濟恐慌之狂潮。一九一四年歐戰前後不同其質之經濟恐慌即其例證。</p>
<p>自產業革命以後。世界各國之生產事業。都已突飛猛進。農業與工業皆爲利用機器力之大量生產獨有我國。則至今尙困囿於小農作生產與手工業生產之範疇。農業則爲亞細亞式之農業生產方法。工業雖以產業先進國家之强制。得以有若干之進步。然而大部分則又都爲資本主義列强所把持。反成爲束縛我民族工業不能發展之桎梏。絲茶素爲我國農業生產之大宗。但今日以銷路停滞。茶產已日益减縮。茶園亦日益荒廢。至於絲產。則更已陷於竭蹶不可復振之困境。由於價格之慘落。與銷路之停滞。養蠶之家。甚至斬桑焚繭益之以連歲荒歉。連歲戰亂。而農業與工業生產更凋敝不堪。素稱以農立國之國家。今則主要之生活必需品如米麥棉花。亦都仰給於外人。生產事業之凋敝。社會經濟之破落。人民生活之苦痛。問題之嚴重。實遠超出貧乏以上。</p>
<p>據本年一月至四月之全國對外貿易統計。進口額爲三萬萬八千八百餘萬海關兩。出口額則僅一萬萬九千餘萬海關兩。入超一萬萬九千餘萬海關兩。平均每月入超爲五千萬海關兩。其主要進口之貨物。以海關金爲單位計</p>
<p>算。最多者爲糟食及糧食物。共八五·四○二·○○○（去年同時期則爲七六。○四五·○○○）内百分之五十爲米。百分之二十五爲麥粉。次爲棉花。紗。綫。共五五·七二○·○○○。（去年同時期則爲四九·六九一·○○○）其他如燭。皂。油。松香。棉織疋頭品。糖。金屬。各礦砂。罐頭食品。酒。烟草。菓品。等進口額。無一不呈激增之勢。就此進口貨物之激增。亦即可以反證我國生產事業之凋敝。長此江河日下。我國前途。寗堪設想。</p>
<p>生產事業旣凋敝如此。而在消費方面。則一般豪富之家。權貴之門。生活務極盡奢侈。衣食住行皆追踵歐式。一切日用所需。務皆取之外人。以十八世紀之生產方法。欲求其配合此種二十世紀之消費力。在此畸形的發展之下。社會經濟之陷於破落凋敝。固自有其必然。</p>
<p>不僅此也。彼豪富之家生活程度。日益提高。但在另一方面。則一般勞苦大衆之生活。寖且降落至水平線以下。災區民衆生活之艱難。更難筆述。一方面有窮奢極欲之豪富。另一方面復有飢寒交迫求死不得求死不得求生不能之無數勞苦大衆。故就消費力而言。其程度亦爲畸形。此種消費力與生產力之不平衡。及消費力之畸形程度。實爲我國前途莫大之危機。</p>
<p>如何以挽救此一危機。斯乃爲我政府我國民當前最迫切急。待答解之問題。自積極方面言之。吾人認爲澄清政治。廢除苛捐雜稅。以求民族實業之發展。俾國產足以供應市塲之要求。自消極方面言之。吾人亦認爲應逐漸提高關稅。藉以阻遏舶來品之流入。同時更應造成儉樸之風氣。養成國人愛用國貨之心理。以樹植民族實業之根基。</p>

<p>張學良令平津東北軍兩路援熱</p>
<p>軍心甚壯謂不讓十九路軍專美</p>
<p>日軍陰謀未得遷還有願和停攻意</p>
<p>天津特訊，在十天以前、張學良的眼光、尙注意於東光大名石家莊一带之防務，所以將某旅開往磁縣彰德、又令某骑兵部開往東光衡水一带、不料兵行在途，而熱河靠不住之驚耗忽至、良以湯玉麟之態度、張固深知、但斷定其不好意思驟然致變、故亦利用其兩面週旋、藉以緩衝一時，顧日軍方面、對於熱河、早已埀涎三尺、茲見湯久不表示態度，迫不及待，乃藉口軍事聯絡員石本權四郎、在朝陽北票之間失踪、進兵向熱河搜索，實行武力侵佔、張學良聞訊、頗爲着急、蓋熱河若亡、察省瀕危、榆關雖不放弃、亦處甕中、平津更非用武之地、遂於十八日黎明下緊急令、命東北軍除駐防平津者、一律動員、限三天内開抵通州、再分兵兩路、一路出古北口赴承德、限五天到達、一路出喜峯口赴朝陽縣、限七天到達、當日即發放六月份薪餉、好在北寗路車輛充足、即刻備妥客貨車四十一列、計開往津浦路二十一列、開往平漢路二十列、截至今午（廿一日）已有十八列車過津赴通州、各部隊抵通州下車、每兵背負子彈□□粒、槍一支、大刀一柄、即徒步前、給養彈藥、均由汽車運送、官兵服裝、均係綠色、與草木顏色相同、全體將士、罔不精神百倍、歡呼如狂、皆曰、（這回到東北去、不殺小鬼、誓不生還嘩决不讓十九路軍專美於前也）記者昨晚在總站見有一列騎兵車開到、即將向東北出發、有三五兵士向站臺棚攔外小販購燒餅、此小販年約十八九歲、問兵士曰、（老總們往那兒開）、一兵答曰、（往喜峯口、出關打日本去）、且談且食、小販聞之狂喜、即向站外小舗乞得一壼白開水、請士兵飲之、吃畢、兵問所値幾何、小販曰、（幾十個燒餅、所値有限、我不要錢了、老總們打完日本、得勝回來、再給錢罷）、又曰、（我願意跟老總們出關、能補兵更好、不然、當馬夫伙夫、亦樂意）、士兵聞之狂笑曰、（老鄉、你等着罷、天津不久就要招兵了、想當兵還不容易嗎）、言畢、給以兩角錢、即上車開走、此一事也、韓家墅楊柳青一带駐軍奉命開拔、照例拉夫抓車、搬運輜重、從前人民一遇此等事件、罔不驚慌奔避、此次除少數庸人自擾外、多數知係出關抗目、均自動效力、此又一事也、就此兩事觀之、北方人民愛國觀念、並未弱於南人、待因受壓制、無從表現其精神耳、</p>
<p>東北軍之在關内者、計步兵□□個旅、騎兵□師、砲兵□旅、從前每旅約一萬四千人、自九一八事變後、因軍餉支絀、大加縮編、汰弱留强、每旅限制一萬人、但被裁之士兵、因退伍後、無以爲生、多數不願離營、平均每有一千備補兵、刻下總數猶有□十萬人、皆係久經訓練之健兒、聞天津保定以南各地防務、暫由龐炳勳商震宋哲元等軍塡駐、其他各地、酌留小部隊留守、藉維治安、可以開赴前綫者、約十□萬人、至必要時、晋綏尙可出兵十萬人、惟瀋陽兵工廠被日軍佔領後、東北軍軍火、頗受影響、但據某高級軍官言、張學良去年放棄錦後、即積極設法補充、刻下已足供長期抵抗之用、此說當不虚也、東北軍今雖出動、究意是否已下收復東北之决心、抑或祇防守熱河門户、想爲國人所欲知者、記者所聞、則有兩說、（一）有十九路軍及馬占山之抗日、全國皆唾駡不抵抗主義者、近來朱霽青領導東北義勇軍作恢復失地運動、且有□□接濟鉅欵之說、張非木偶、能不動心、加以軍餉困難、察冀兩省不能生存、而輿論之督責環境之壓迫、將士之離　、在在感覺未來之危險、與其坐待山窮水盡以崩潰、何如乘此機會、幹他一下、以求生存、即不能必勝、而又以□十餘萬大軍、亦可予日軍以重創、屆時震動世界、視聽　新、對日交涉、亦可較有力量、况在此青紗帳起之時、飛機投彈、失其效用、坦克車與重砲之效力亦微、東北軍地理極熟、若利用義勇軍作先鋒、此時抗日、實爲最佳時期、（二）武力收回東北、談何庸易、若中央無整個計畫、張亦决無單獨抗日之魄力、故此次動員、志在保護熱河、否則熱河若失、冀察無險可守、不需日軍來犯、僞滿洲軍亦可升堂入室、所以保護熱河、即係保護冀察、此番陳兵熱邊、敵如來犯、則擊退之、如果義勇軍進攻得利、則亦恊同動作、互作聲援、此兩說各具相當理由、吾人未知張氏何擇也、</p>
<p>又據某要人談、日軍進窺熱河之心、固囑迫切、然對此青葱無際之青紗帳、亦感作戰困難、彼唯、希望、係欲熱河自起變化、否則俟至秋節後、農人收穫完畢、大地一望無垠之時、再進兵攻熱、最近忽有石本失踪可作藉口、遂乘機向朝陽進兵、意在壓迫熱河發生變化、不料熱河鎭靜　如故、東北軍已緊急出動、决心抵抗、由朝陽至承德、峯　疊障、绵亘七百里而無開擴之平地、日軍如於此時進攻、不特須受重大犧牲、且無正大理由可藉、徒使國聯調查團、增加惡劣印象、所以兩次轟炸朝陽並無效果、適湯玉麟駐瀋代表向日軍商量停戰、允設法拯救石本、日軍遂乘風轉舵、暫停進攻、北票商農兩會會長邵子峯、已於昨日赴朝陽、接洽和解條件、至於日軍提出之條件、除責成熱軍負責拯救石本外、竟有銷滅義勇軍之條、此外有無苛刻之要、刻尚未知、（七月二十一日）</p>

<p>捷克聲勢凌人、初以六比零佔先、久而漸居人後、然相差極微、苟處置有方、海格難操必勝之權、但以經騐之不如、第一盤終以十八比二十一失敗、</p>
<p>第二盤海格益見　活、曹將軍之　壓、無往不利、然而捷克亦尚能應付、不幸在下半盤時、陣綫散亂、致遭海格之壓迫、又歸失敗、结果海格又以二十一比十五勝、</p>
<p>第三盤爲兩隊生死之戰、捷克應戰之得法、使海格難以對付、一時曾以十八比十五佔先、最後又以散漫而失敗、大可惋惜結果、海格再以二十一比十八得勝</p>

<h3 id="c174">蠖兒二一枝譚 <a href="#c174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>突如其來的怪僻名詞，會得瀾翻在一般青年的舌底·，最近發現的，便是蠖兒兩個字。</p>
<p>蠖字的讀音，是鳥没切·，大約，在汪或兩字之間··比汪字讀音重一些，比或字讀音輕一些，便是青年口中蠖兒的蠖字。</p>
<p>蠖兒兩字的出發點，大槪在上海吧。利用着鐵路的交通，沿着滬杭，京滬二線的學校青年，大槪都會說蠖兒兩字的了。　　蠖兒的正確解釋，尙没定論。有人說··是舶來品，是西文Ｗｉｌｅ的譯音，作詭詐解。但是，學生口中的蠖兒·並非專作詭譎解··凡是特殊的，權術的，能幹的，都可把蠖兒兩字來形容的。	現有愈傳愈廣，不限在青年學生·，凡是白相人的口中，往往蠖兒長，蠖兒短，講十句話，至少要支配三四個蠖兒··那麽蠖兒兩個字，幾乎成爲一種市井切口了。</p>
<p>從前流行的怪僻名詞，人人都是發血長，發血短··現在流行的怪僻名詞，人人又是蠖兒長，蠖兒短。昔日的發血發血，成了東北血戰淞滬血戰的惡讖··今日的蠖兒，只怕也不是佳讖吧。自經九一八和一二八以後，中國的蠖塞，達於極點·，在這時候，還高呼着蠖兒蠖兒，實在是蠖塞！實在是不景氣！</p>
<p>政府定下的正當名詞，如南京稱首都，北京稱北平·，但是，一股人口中，依舊南京北京，習而不改·，惟有這不可思議的蠖兒，不知具何魔力，會得通行無阻，瀾翻在一般青年的舌底！咄咄怪事！咄咄怪事！</p>

<p>— 王蘧常</p>
<p>馬忠武俊玉崑爲輓近名將。甲午之役。轉戰於田莊臺太平山感立寨之間。以千數百人抗賊兵數萬。奮力搘拄。卒能屹然自全。尤以大同江（在朝鮮平壤）之戰爲最著。忠武之檄駐大同也。賊初以輕騎來。嘗一戰敗之。繼而賊援螘附。逾二萬。我軍大震。公猶洋洋如平時。從容謂遊擊曰。若以千人逆戰。寗死母歸炊許。使來告急。公曰。死若干曰。可二百矣。公怫然曰。及五百。然後來告。遊擊乃以半伏壕中。爲左。半伏林中。爲右。相犄角。戰五時。賊砲隊至。悉力攻林。彈著木。聲若裂山。林木盡折。公度其少罷。亟揮全軍乘之。時士卒蓄怒已久。勢若風雨。呼聲動天地。賊出不意。遂大潰。伏屍數千。江水爲之盡赤。是役也。賊人喪膽。辟易數十里。公方議逐北。而總兵衛汝貴已遯。歸路爲賊所斷。公大憤。銜髮奮刀。親突陳。中貫之。竟冒圍全其軍而歸。同時聶患節公士成亦敢戰。奪賊氣。而統帥宋慶者。巧宦臨二公上。實怯懦。嫉娟其功。陰掣肘之。公歎曰。使我與功亭併力。不使祝三扼我。賊不足平也。功亭忠節字。祝三宋慶字也。及和議成。公仰天大哭。不食者數日。全軍皆感動泣下。其後　庚子之役。亦疊著戰功。敵人謚曰烈馬。今龍江馬將軍。亦以忠勇名天下。後先輝照。其亦聞其家風而起者乎。</p>
<h3 id="c176">西子的病 <a href="#c176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— 山茶</p>
<p>西湖，有色彩艶麗的湖山給畫家做題材，有悠長的梵鐘温軟原湖風以及許多聲與色可供詩人來抒情，有合宜的氣候清鮮的空氣使生病的人健康，有澄清的流波幽默的小徑可以給多情姑娘們忘情，有平和的空間芬香的庭宇供小夫婦們安逸地度過蜜月，有算不清的神廟禪寺給佛婆婆們掛着黄布口袋奔忙，有修長的堤岸與寂寞的山道給失意的政客和貧小子們躑躅，並且還有許多許多值得考古學爱植物學家地質學家的以及各式各樣的家與者們拿起顯微鏡或費去很多的腦汁。總而言之，西湖是適合每一種人的需求，而誰没有蒞臨過西湖便將被誰引以爲大大的憾事。所以匆忙地來華而負有重大使命的麥考益之流（國聯調查團的委員），也不免要忙裏偷閒，美其名曰道過而作了一次西子的巡訪。由此，你可知道西子有多大的媚勁兒？可是，可是宇宙間是有着如下的鐵也似的定律··隨着（盛極必衰）的一句話，便有着一美人黄土）給古今同慨了。西子，也不能幸而例外，於是，光輝璀璨的黄金期旣過，也就不可免地步上了愁怨慘落的前章，而今，而今她已得着了不治的沉疴。</p>
<p>晚近，在小鳥歡唱的清晨，湖山是張開了倦怠而惺忪的睡眼，假如你要起個早，一賞西子的晨妝，那麽你將大大地失望，因爲跑（蘇堤春曉）也好，你跑（幽谷廻聲）也得，你定會聽見粗壯的軍歌兒在揚溢，縱使羣山都披着美麗的陽光，湖光漾出甜靜的笑壓，你總不能不感到在恬靜的清幽的西子的懷抱當中，有着極端不相稱的調子。</p>
<p>蘇堤白堤，自從把石亂草長的小徑改成火蛇樣的馬路，雖然穿着高跟鞋的女史們得着了不少的方便，可是獸樣的汽車却着了瘋也似的在上面暴跳，堅實的輪胎在地迸出了惱人的聲響，跟着再拖起了黄塵萬丈，姑娘們邁着慢步走過時將頻添了許多麻煩，當無意得着了後面的警報！那大聲的怪呌，便要小心翼翼地避走在一旁。當那獸樣的東西身旁風也似的跑着，不由得要柳腰一擺，而把小手絹拖住粉裝的準鼻，正是刻不容緩了。好，這在寧靜的空間把着圈圈兒的格沙林的臭味把醉人的花香奪去，而（鳴鳴）的暴呌也就代替了當年清脆的禽啼了，這雖然是所謂物質文明的施及，可是我們這聖處女般的西子那裏受得住於是，懨　地瘦損了容顏，减退了臉色，面荷菱還未透出香味的時候，你便會在葛嶺下邊廳見那秋蟲的悲歌，而一聲聲繚人鞋跟的鐘，彷佛已是Ｄｉｎｄａｎ－Ｂｅｌｌ要把西子葬送，這已經夠使西子受用。更何况盜案迭起，龍井的採茶女，黄龍洞的佛婆婆全都蒙了刦難，於是西湖已成了險境，柳蔭裏，堤岸上就有着我們的弟兄在防範，不用說，刀光與湖光攪成了一片。這樣，顯然地會把西子的弱命斷送。</p>

<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>近具爾格蘭地方，發現一個青年，他在五年之中，	竟接連和二十五個少女訂婚，所以他一共有了二十五個未婚妻，但現在他却因爲犯了騙取所有的未婚妻的金錢和衣物的罪而送進監獄裏去了。他在每次和少女們訂婚的時候，都說結婚以後，必將所欠的金錢和衣物償還的。這次當他送進監獄裏去的時候，對人說道··（這是很値得的一件事，我已騙到了這麽多的未婚妻。）當法庭開審的一天，被騙的少女，到庭的一共有二十人，内中有許多女子，並且對他說，倘然他能履行婚約，便可不起訴的。但他很堅决的說道··（不，我馬上要到牢監裏去了。）</p>

<p>— 黄覺民</p>
<p>有友自故鄉來。爲述滬戰正濃時。抗日健兒之一段奇緣。事殊旖旎。筆之於下。以資談助。</p>
<p>吾邑北門外。寗紹會館在焉。會館附有丙舍。每逢清明節。家人莫不携酒提箔。以吊新魂。有女小字娟者。新喪母。停柩於舍。清明因亦往吊。適有某軍官經其地。入内游覽。聞哭聲甚哀。循聲往視。驚爲天人。不禁駐足傾聽。少焉。女郎仍哀泣不已。軍官情不自禁。竟扶之起。勸以止涙。女郎認爲侮辱。方欲斥之。而軍官續作極温柔之語相慰。女郎見其憨態可掬。不期嫣然一笑。急　手去。軍官悵然良久。若有所失。後詢之舍中人。方悉女郎家境中落。乏資營葬。故不得已而厝舍。因急返軍部。以五百金令衛兵送贈女家。謂知女家正苦無資葬母。區區五百金。聊盡寸衷。女郎有兄。初極駭異。旋向女探得前情。極表不滿。認爲贈金必有他圖。欲却之。然又攝於對方爲武裝階級。正躊躇間。而女郎又堅持不可。終於無可如何而受之。無何。軍官之冰人果至矣。具言傾慕女郎之忱。欲娶女以主帷幄。女兄固一商人。見軍官下攀。早已手足無措。不知應若何應付。亟商之女郎。並嗔女不應力主接受贈金。致釀今日之變。女郎初則桃雲飛面。垂頭不語。旣而堅决表示願隨軍官。並以生死爭。女兄以女志不可奪、不得已。出而允焉。於是此風光旖旎之啼笑姻緣。遂蜚聲全邑。以迄於今。</p>

<p>— 何躬行</p>
<p>（十三）石膏模型工廠</p>
<p>石膏模型。爲案頭或牆壁妝飾品。圖書者。用之以寫生。或作標本模型。銷路至浩繁也。羅馬希臘意法等國。出貨精美。栩栩如生。日貨亦有進口者。顧工作粗劣。不及西貨遠甚。惟其價廉。尚能銷行我國。民國十年。上海有齊冠山者。歸自日本。以留日得得。創設石膏美術工藝廠於上海西門大吉路。翻製各式人物肖像。營業頗不惡。雖係小資本工藝。亦頗受當世美術家之欣賞地。</p>
<p>繼美術廠起者。有美藝中華二家。均美專畢業生徒所創設。迄今上海全市共有三家。美藝在菜市路。中華在亞爾培路。</p>
<p>石膏產於我國四川湖北等省。市價每担四元有餘。上海勞勃生路瑞泰石粉廠小　渡路順昌石粉廠。專用機製各種白石粉。内石膏粉亦有出售者。每担値洋九元左右。石粉雖較石膏貴至一倍以上。然用石粉。可省去一筆磨工。</p>
<p>製造石膏模型。完全係手工業。不過利用模型耳。資本之大小。視其廠中模型之多少爲斷。卽小至一二百元。亦可開設。</p>
<p>每一人物模型。必係多方模型併合。否則石粉人模型後。不易取出。惟簡單者。亦有止一塊模型。人物肖像中有曲度者。往往另行裝添。蓋非如此。不能得完全也。</p>
<p>如翻偉人肖像等。則先將粘土彫塑成其形。先製模型。再翻石膏像。模型一日不壞。石膏像一日可做。</p>
<p>製法以石膏粉和以適合之水。入型中。待稍乾取出。加以修飾卽成。至彫塑工藝。則非學有專長不可。</p>
<p>（十四）寛緊带</p>
<p>寛緊带向係日貨。民國九年間。閘北天通菴路。有鴻裕带廠者。爲國人製造寛緊带之第一人。顧不久停閉。現在上海製造寛緊带者。有德隆。在馬霍路。新施。在南成都路。匯昌。在楊樹浦路。長城。在舟山路。美德。在南陽橋。林蔭。在林蔭路。鴻隆。在海潮寺路。精美。在徽寗路。共計八家。以德隆最大。出品亦較多。</p>
<p>寛緊带最大用途。爲製襪圈。與吊襪带。分棉織絲織二類。市上通用者。大都以八十支絲光線。和人造絲。及橡皮線。織者居多。狹者闊僅三分。闊者一寸四分。織狹带多用鐵質搖带車。闊带則多以木機平織之。顏色繁多。闊狹不等。故價格至不一律。每板十二碼。除上海八廠出品。暢銷各埠外。蘇州美綸廠所出之寛緊带。亦以上海爲傾銷地。蓋價廉物美。尤受滬人歡迎也。惜其原料。均係外貨。而橡皮带。更非日貨不可。</p>

<p>— 不除庭草齋夫</p>
<p>五十九</p>
<p>我說··（古廟之所以能夠辦到全村皆兵，多半是因爲江營長肯得下鄉盡義務·，如果全國普通的推行起來，那有這許多的退伍軍官肯任指導？朱先生說··（現在全國有二百多萬軍隊，用現成的軍隊訓練當地人民自衛是簡便無比。軍隊的責任不但是保國衛民而且要訓練人民起來保護自已的村莊和自已的國家。如果各地的軍隊都負起這個責任，那末，敎官現成的，學兵是現成的，槍械是現成的，不要多少時候，便能把中華民國造成一個鋼鑄的江山，誰也不能破壞地。現在最大的困難是大家不明白自已的責任。只要人民認清保護國家與村莊是自已的責任而各地軍隊也認清訓練人民自衛爲自已當盡的義務，其餘的一切都好辦了。）</p>
<p>六十</p>
<p>我又問··（現在國家已到生死存亡關頭，中華民族除軍事之外還應該受什麽訓練才能起死回生轉危爲安？）朱先生說··）敎育是在與國難賽跑。依我看來，中華民族應該同受六大訓練才能渡過難關。這六大訓練是··</p>
<p>一，普遍的軍事訓練，使人人成爲保國的健兒·，二，普遍的生產訓練，使人人成爲造富的工人·，三，普遍的科學訓練，使人人能在勞力上勞心·，四，普遍的識字訓練，使人人獲得傳達思想的符號·，五，普遍的民權訓練，使人人成爲中華民國的主人·，六，普遍的生育訓練，使人人到了生育年齡可以生得少生得好以再造未來更優良的民族。）</p>

<p>角洋平穏銅元又長江南小洋、早午兩市因無人交易、故結果兩市始终無人問津、交易絶無、而市價均照舊盤爲六錢零三厘、廣東小洋早市爲五錢八分九厘、午市爲五錢八分八厘八毫七忽半、結果兩市間僅差一毫二忽半、交易早市九萬角、午市二萬五千角、銅元又後復長一千五百文、計有四百二十七千文矣、交易亦多、計有四萬六千餘串、計代價銀欵有一萬零八百兩之巨、</p>

<p>洋交易午市極冷靜、洋欵交易午市尤爲岑寂、匯劃票欵早市做出五十五萬、午市祇三十萬較上次星期日尤爲遜色、鈔票早市四萬、午市一萬五千、塲外鈔票早市七萬五千、午市四萬、銀行早市互市五十萬、午市互市四十萬、各銀行洋户往來收解一百廿餘萬、鈔票進出一百六十餘萬、錢莊洋公單收解四百七八十萬、洋押欵交易三十餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解一百五十餘萬、拆借洋欵進出一百三十餘萬、小錢莊交易四五十萬客路去胃三十餘萬、</p>

<h3 id="c202">墨索里尼的話 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>意首相墨索里尼，近日解釋法西斯的意義，其中有數語曰··</p>
<p>就法西斯的立塲言，生活乃一種奮鬭，每一個人首須克制自已，俾鍜鍊能成一有價値之工具，足以服務自身，服務國家，服務人羣，本來一個人無論做什麽事，先要以身作則，方生效力，若自已先不能克制，而欲克制他人，這原是辦不到的事，故古德有言曰，已欲立而立人，已欲達而達人，若自已欲立欲達，而不想去立人達人，這是獨善其身，完全不懂恕道，所以要人立達，必先自已立達，要人克制，必先自已克制，方能不受人家批評，方能發生效力。</p>
<p>意首相墨索里尼組織棒喝黨以來，頗獲得相當的效果，於是傾向於黷武主義者，均有躍躍欲試之槪，如日本軍閥，亦有法西斯的組織，是其例也，惟一國的政治思想，原是應付政治環境而發生，故有一代的政治情形，便發生一代的政治思想，自歐洲大戰而後，政治思潮，爲之突變，一種是積極的棒喝主義，一種是消極的共產主義，這兩種主義，就在這個潮流應運而生，均獲得相當的效果，但我國以何種主義爲適應潮流，原當視國情之若何與國民性之若何而定，且不必去加以討論。</p>
<p>惟墨索里尼所謂首先克制自已，方能服務國家，服務人羣，眞是一句精理名言，若果能實行此語，無論何種主義，無論在朝在野，自會有效力發生，即如印度甘地，主張無抵抗主義，處處以身作則，克制自已，試問其感化能力如何，其所收效力如何，否則雖天天去高喊怎樣主義，怎樣政策，無非心勞力拙而已。</p>
<h3 id="c203">改良社會討論會環境可以改造嗎 <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— 黄覺民提議</p>
<p>環境可以改造嗎？這是我向改良社會討論會提出的建議案，下面是我個人對這問題的一點討論。</p>
<p>談改造環境，第一步，我覺得須先，把環境的眞義弄明白。要明白環境的眞義，最好是引杜威的學說。</p>
<p>杜威說··（環境是生物學上的一個專門語，在進化觀念上佔很重要的地位。凡屬有機體，一方面必須依賴周圍的物件，以維持他的生活··他方面這些圍繞他的物件，又能影響他的活動）。</p>
<p>根據這段話，我們可以得到兩個要點·，</p>
<p>（一）促進生物活動的種種情况，是環境·，</p>
<p>（二）阻碍生物活動的種種情况，也是環境。</p>
<p>但通常我們所稱的環境，多指後者，本文所討論的範圍，也只限於後者。</p>
<p>我敢說，除大之　子）外，大多數人是被環境支配的，被環境壓迫的。這支配，這壓迫，我們根本無法解脫嗎？我又敢說，除（妄人）外，凡人都可把他的環境改造的··因爲只有妄人，才會脚都没有動，而在心裏造出千萬困難。</p>
<p>那末，改造環境的方法，究是怎樣呢？據我近年來與環境奮鬭的經騐，認爲有效的，有下面四種··</p>
<p>（一）堅决的意志！這條是人人明瞭的，而却是人人最不易辦到的。其實我覺得人旣然終要在地面上生存的，活動的，便不應該以爲生活上發生了困難和阻碍，就（望風披靡）（曳甲而逃），必得具着百折不回的意志，與環境奮鬥到底，環境之能改造，恃有决心，改造之能到底，恃有毅力，望大家不要忘了這句話。</p>
<p>（二）十分的忍耐上解决問題，必經相當的手續與時間，問題愈難，則解决的手續往往愈麻煩，經過的時間也往往愈長久，這是顚撲不破的事實，無法取巧的。所以我們在解决一個問題的時候，必須十分的忍耐，忍耐麻煩與時間上的相當經過。</p>
<p>（三）優美的習慣！在力圖改造環境的過程中，必須養成一種極優美的習慣，方能繼續不斷的奮鬥。這習惯，就是困難問題來的時候，我們只許他引起我們的考慮，而不許他引起我們的愁慮。惟其如是，外面的壓迫雖厲，我們的身心雖因力謀應付困難而不免疲乏，但精神鎭定，内心寛泰，不致因此内傷，而能養蓄力量，繼續與環境戰，最後的勝利，終必歸於我們。</p>
<p>（四）相當的企圖！凡自已能力所長的事業，我對此有所欲望，就是相當的企圖。我以爲我們對社會的貢獻，不是要做到所謂大人物，只要就各人自已能力之所長作儘量努力的貢獻，就是對社會最大的貢獻。倘可以權衡的話，我相信這樣的貢獻，絶不比大人物的貢獻來得小·，也許有的地方，大人物的貢獻，竟不及這樣的貢獻。我們最壞的心理，是在專歆動於他人之已成事業，或爲虚榮心所驅駛，結果，反湮没了自已的所長，而得不到絲毫的成功，因之日陷於痛苦的環境中，而不能自拔。故欲改造環境，就自已能力所長的一條路走，方能所向無敵。</p>
<p>被環境壓迫的人們！這點貢獻，你看了以爲怎樣？不對呢，請你指敎·，對呢！就請你快快照此做去，光明的境域！就在我們的前面！</p>

<p>— 履霜</p>
<p>答平章先生</p>
<p>火酒的製法，非一二紙的空文，所能完全解决，旣承下問，只以愚意所及述之。</p>
<p>（一）甲醇的製法··取木塊放在鐵蒸溜器中乾蒸，蒸溜器只有一出口，以便蒸出物放出而外界空氣不能入内。及一切可蒸發的東西都蒸出後，剩下的是木炭，可供燃料。蒸出物通至凝結器Ｃｏｎｄｅｎｓｅｒ，一部分成液體·，另一部分仍爲氣體，内含輕氣，一氧化炭等，可通至氣體貯藏器用作燃料。凝結下的液體，含有柏油，百份之一的甲醇，百份之五到八的醋酸和少量的酮Ａｃｅｔｏｎｅｏ柏油不溶於水，其餘都溶於水，所以柏油可以分開··惟此水溶液仍含少量的柏油，可用低温蒸溜，柏油的沸點高，所以不蒸出。這蒸出物名呌Ｐｙｒｏｌｉｇｎｅｏｕｓａｃｉｄ，内仍含甲醇，醋酸和少量的酮。於是用石灰中和醋酸使成不蒸發的醋酸鈣２ＣＨ３Ｃｏｏｈ（醋酸）十Ｃａｏ（石灰）（ＣＨ３Ｃｏｏ）２Ｃａ十Ｈ２Ｏ。再行蒸發，得甲醇和酮的混合液體。酮比甲醇容易蒸發，可用分别蒸溜法ＦｒａｃｔｉｏｎａｌＡＤｉｓｔｉｌｌａｔｉｏｎ先將酮蒸出，剩下的是甲醇和水的混液。再用分别蒸溜法蒸出甲醇，如是所得的出品，不純物很少。</p>
<p>總上所述，正出品是甲醇，副產品有柏油，焦炭，燃氣，醋酸，酮等都於日用上，工業上用途很廣。</p>
<p>（二）乙醇的製法··製乙醇的原料，大槪用山芋，玉蜀黍粉，乳糖，和其他各種澱粉糖類，視各處的物價而定。</p>
<p>如原料爲糖類則只發酵和蒸溜二種手續··如原料爲澱粉，則須先化爲糖，再行發酵。</p>
<p>先以澱粉和水煑一小時，使成稀薄澱粉溶液，和以麥麴！一種發酵物，英名Ｍａｌｔ　至適當時期，澱粉爲麥麴化爲麥精糖。用水漂出，以待第二手續。</p>
<p>以水將糖稀薄，使成百份之十的溶液，加入百份之十的營養液！此液由硝酸鉀，氯化鎂，硝酸鈣，憐酸鉀各一克和水一百立方生的合成，作酵母菌的食物！再加入少量硫酸，使此液成弱酸性，别種害菌可不致生存。最後混以酵母菌。在發酵期内，有多量的熱放散，所以必須加以適當監視，使温度不過華氏一百度。約經一星期，以此液蒸溜，再經重溜Ｒｅｃｔｉｒｉｃａｔｉｏｎ，即成百份之九十五的乙醇，内含不純物極少。</p>
<p>如原料爲糖則發酵和蒸溜的手續一樣。</p>
<p>以上講了一大堆，只極簡單的述了一二，平章先生或其他同志欲研究，可參考各種工業化學專書，此間地位有限恕不盡述。</p>

<p>— 滄萍</p>
<p>好容易費了三年功夫，從掃地抹桌裏鑽出頭來，才成了現在的一個小夥計，</p>
<p>在學業時代的把望做夥計，像學生的把望做博士一樣，以爲做了夥計，進益豐裕了，做的事可以稍爲上層了，我心裏具有的計劃，可以發揮了，一步步的上去，由小夥計做經理，由經理做老班，做了老班發財，發了財辦｀｀｀｀｀｀｀，理想中一切的一切，都可以解决了，</p>
<p>事實是没有這樣容易的，吾十七歲做小夥計起，到現在二十五歲，還是一個小夥計，吾做了這九年的小夥計，所得到的經騐和條件，是這樣的。</p>
<p>上司的命令，應當敬重，他們放的屁，你不能嫌臭，對老班要忠實，對别人要詭詐，你有一滴汗，應該爲他淌，他賺幾萬金，你不要顧問，你如果已經娶妻，最好呌老婆守着活寡，他呢，三房四妾，一天是不能離開的，這是他前世修到的應享權利，最重要的年齡不能老大，如果你于思滿面，眼目昏化了，還是你自已識相，捲着鋪蓋回家，免開他老人家的尊口。</p>
<p>頂頂使吾寒心的，做夥計不該生病，一病拖長，你的飯碗，就要不保，並且你的辛俸，從此停發，啊！可憐！吾替毫無儲蓄的小夥計擔憂，吾爲與吾同病的小夥計放聲一哭，最後，祈求老天，再不要加小夥計的病苦了，默祝老老班們，對於我們痛苦無告的小夥計，放鬆些鞭策吧。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Deformed Development of Production and Consumption <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Production and consumption must be balanced; production exceeding consumption is termed (surplus), while consumption exceeding production is (poverty). In a capitalist society, both surplus and poverty can incite a wave of economic panic. The economic panics before and after the European War of 1914, differing in nature, serve as examples.</p>
<p>Since the Industrial Revolution, the production industries of various countries worldwide have advanced rapidly. Both agriculture and industry have utilized machine power for large-scale production. Only our country remains confined to the scope of small-scale agricultural production and handicraft production. Agriculture employs Asiatic-style production methods. Although industry has made some progress due to the coercion of industrialized advanced countries, the majority is controlled by capitalist powers, becoming a shackle restricting the development of our national industry. Silk and tea are traditionally the mainstays of our country's agricultural production, but today, with sluggish sales, tea production has been declining, and tea gardens are increasingly abandoned. As for silk production, it has fallen into a state of exhaustion from which it cannot recover. Due to the sharp decline in prices and sluggish sales, silkworm farmers are even cutting down mulberry trees and burning cocoons, exacerbating the situation with consecutive years of famine and war. Agricultural and industrial production is becoming increasingly dilapidated. A country traditionally known for its agricultural foundation now relies on foreign countries for essential necessities such as rice, wheat, and cotton. The dilapidation of production industries, the decline of the social economy, and the suffering of the people are problems that far exceed poverty.</p>
<p>According to foreign trade statistics for the nation from January to April of this year, imports amounted to over 388.8 million customs taels, while exports amounted to only over 190 million customs taels, resulting in an import surplus of over 198.8 million customs taels, with an average monthly import surplus of 50 million customs taels. The main imported goods, calculated in customs gold units, are:</p>
<p>The most significant is grain and foodstuffs, totaling 85,402,000 (compared to 76,045,000 in the same period last year), with 50% being rice and 25% being wheat flour. Next is cotton, yarn, and thread, totaling 55,720,000 (compared to 49,691,000 in the same period last year). Other imports such as candles, soap, oil, rosin, cotton piece goods, sugar, metals, various mineral ores, canned foods, wine, tobacco, and fruits have all shown a sharp increase. The sharp increase in imported goods can also be seen as evidence of the dilapidation of our country's production industries. If this continues to decline, our country's future is unimaginable.</p>
<p>With production industries so dilapidated, the consumption of the wealthy and powerful is extremely extravagant. They emulate the European style in clothing, food, housing, and transportation, relying on foreign countries for daily necessities. Attempting to match this 20th-century consumption power with 18th-century production methods, under this deformed development, the decline of the social economy is inevitable.</p>
<p>Not only that, but the standard of living of the wealthy is increasing day by day, while the lives of the general working class are falling below the poverty line. The hardships of the people in disaster areas are beyond description. On the one hand, there are wealthy people living in extravagance, and on the other hand, there are countless working-class people struggling with hunger and cold, unable to live and unable to die. Therefore, in terms of consumption power, the degree of deformity is also severe. This imbalance between consumption and production, and the deformity of consumption power, is a major crisis for our country's future.</p>
<p>How to save this crisis is the most urgent problem for our government and our people to solve. From a positive perspective, we believe that clarifying politics and abolishing excessive taxes and levies to promote the development of national industries, so that domestic products can meet the demands of the market. From a negative perspective, we also believe that tariffs should be gradually increased to block the inflow of foreign goods. At the same time, a frugal atmosphere should be created to cultivate the mentality of using domestic goods, so as to establish the foundation of national industries.</p>

<p>The Executive Yuan Orders the Entire Country to Resist Aggression</p>
<p>The Main Force of Japanese Troops at Chaoyang Temple Begins to Withdraw</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Rehe telephone line is still not restored due to wind and rain obstruction; it is being repaired. Telegrams from Chengde to Beiping reported tranquility yesterday and today. It is rumored that the Japanese-controlled Beipiao branch line will resume traffic. The Japanese military's invasion of Rehe, followed by its halt, according to those familiar with the situation in Rehe, is due to two reasons: first, Rehe is mostly mountainous, with treacherous terrain, and the Japanese military is unfamiliar with the geography; second, the Japanese side is divided into two factions. The young faction advocates actively using force against China to intimidate the investigation team and change the conclusions of its report, while the veteran faction advocates not taking further actions until the plan to manage the Eastern Provinces is completed, so as not to alarm the world. Behind the scenes, the latter faction is more powerful. Currently, they are actively training puppet self-defense forces as tools for future aggression against China. (23rd Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Executive Yuan President Wang Jingwei telegraphed to the military and political authorities of various provinces and city governments on the 22nd, stating that Director Zhang Hao of the Beiping Pacification Commissioner's Office telegraphed that Japanese troops, at Shenshi Wu, charged towards Chaoyang Temple with two armored trains.

In addition to ordering the garrison troops to strictly prevent and resolutely resist, and telegraphed to the ambassador to Japan to lodge a serious protest, this is specially telegraphed for your information.

It is hoped that our governing officials will supervise their subordinates to work together and devise ways to defend the country, and inform the public to maintain national order, consolidate their own unity, make preparations in many ways, and go to a unified goal to resist aggression and protect our territory. This is what we earnestly hope. (23rd Special Telegram)</p>

He quickly ambushed 2,300 infantry and cavalry. When half of the Japanese army crossed the ridge, our army launched a fierce attack from all sides, cutting the enemy into several sections. The enemy stubbornly resisted, fighting fiercely in hand-to-hand combat. Just as the enemy was about to be completely wiped out, the enemy's reinforcements arrived, with fierce artillery fire, and the pressure became more urgent. Due to insufficient ammunition, our army temporarily retreated and simultaneously summoned troops from Suiyi and other departments and adopted guerrilla tactics.

The remaining bandits are fleeing in all directions. The Hu Zongnan army has been transferred to Hubei to assist in the suppression. Hao Menglin's army will be transferred to Wuxue.

Before leaving, he convened a meeting of division commanders, brigade commanders, and department chiefs at the provincial government to report on the mission to Beiping and instructed the divisions to take their duties seriously. He also told reporters that he only advocates resisting strong enemies externally and suppressing local bandits internally. If there is something wrong with Beiping and Tianjin, how can Shandong steal peace? The unity of North China is the only way to resist insults. Those who seek survival in death may survive, and those who fear death will surely die. He came from the military and has been eating public food for twenty years. Now that the country is in trouble, how can he be at ease if he does not work hard? The mission to Beiping is to unite North China and go to the national crisis together. Shi Yousan said that he went to Beiping to meet Zhang, and past events are like smoke in the face of the national crisis, and will not be mentioned again. He has been suffering from stomach pain recently and plans to live in Jinan for a long time. After meeting Zhang, he will return to Shandong with Han.

He said that he went to the university previously to temporarily maintain school affairs for a short period. Later, because the Reorganization Committee convened, he sorted out the internal affairs of the school after being discharged from the hospital. Currently, the library, registration, accounting, and general affairs departments of the school are still being sorted out. Some professors had been hired previously. Apart from the Shanghai Business and Medical Schools, there were about 100 full-time professors at the school at the time of the dissolution. This time, more than 60 people have been hired first. Many of the others have taken other jobs or other tasks. Furthermore, as a result of this reorganization of departments, the number of professors required by each department must be determined by the department heads. Therefore, the remaining professors, full-time lecturers, and teaching assistants will be handled by President Li. Regarding the funding for the affiliated farms of the Agricultural College, efforts are being made to raise funds so that the important research and field work of the college will not be stagnated. As for other matters, it will be up to President Li to preside over when he arrives at the school. (23rd Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

Later, the Japanese claimed to have found letters in the bureau addressed to Wang Delin, the commander of the National Salvation Army. When he was taken to Dunhua for interrogation, he was released.

<p>Named the "Meirin Society," with Tanaka as President</p>
<p>Advocating the Elimination of Corrupt Politics and Purification of Officialdom</p>
<p>Publicly Promoting an Asian Monroe Doctrine</p>
<p>Established Political Parties Cannot Help But Fear It</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 22nd: An association organized by retired army and navy generals has today issued a political platform with the following three propositions: (1) Asia should be for Asians; (2) Security of national defense; (3) Rejection of the 1930 London Naval Treaty.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 19th: In recent months, newly created political groups have sprung up in Japan like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, increasing endlessly, indicating the growing dissatisfaction of all parties with existing political parties. The "Meirin Society" is an attempt to establish a political party. Most of the members are retired army and navy generals. Tanaka, the former commander-in-chief of the Japanese army in Taiwan, is the president of the society. Therefore, the two major political parties in the Diet, the Seiyukai and the Minseito, cannot help but fear the new party. The purpose of the Meirin Society is not to abolish the representative system or dissolve the Diet, but to purify the Diet, and to say that Diet members should put the welfare of the country and the people first, and the interests of the party second. The Meirin Society is characterized by purifying officialdom and eliminating corrupt politics, and strongly criticizes existing political parties, and is eager to rise up and replace them. The Society convened a general meeting on May 12 to decide to organize branches in various important cities, and to select young and talented people with military experience from local councils to preside over them. It is said that Japanese politicians in general are very afraid of the rise of the Meirin Society. It is rumored that Tokonami, a leader of the Seiyukai, recently met with Tanaka to persuade him to stop his activities, and said that the major political parties have now realized this and will henceforth strive sincerely to seek the interests of the country. However, Tanaka took a tough stance and strongly refused, and criticized the errors of the existing political parties, which led to the current serious situation. Political parties have repeatedly promoted reform, but the result has been empty talk. Even if they realize it now, it is too late. If you want to safely pass through the current crisis, even relying on the military to lead the people, the political parties are really not trustworthy. This is the essence of the rumors about the conversation between Tokonami and Tanaka. Judging from public opinion, it is quite similar. It is also said that former Colonial Minister Nagai, Home Minister Adachi, and other dignitaries also met with Tanaka to exchange views, but with the exception of Nakano, the others were criticized. Nakano has a tendency towards fascism and is now helping Adachi organize a new party. His conversation with Tanaka was kept strictly secret, and the content is unknown. Tanaka's political movement, although seeking military intervention in politics, may have his own good intentions. According to the current state of Japanese politics, it is impossible for a single party to govern. The greatest crisis is that reactionary elements use the opportunity to seek private gain. If Saito continues in office, there is nothing to worry about. However, the downfall of the Saito Cabinet is possible at any time. Once it collapses, it is difficult to predict what kind of situation will arise. Tanaka, seeing this situation, seems to want to unite law-abiding elements to prevent violent changes, and to purify political parties in the hope of preserving the representative system. Tanaka is a leader among the military, and served as a military attaché at the Japanese embassy in the UK. He has always been friendly to the UK. During the Russo-Japanese War, he was the chief of staff of Kodama, helping to attack Lushun. He attended the Versailles and Washington Conferences. In addition, he served as chief of military intelligence, commander of the guards division, commander-in-chief of the Japanese army in Taiwan and other important positions. In 1927, he was promoted to general, and then served as a military councilor. He retired two years later.</p>

<p>Decision to Appoint Matsuoka as Chief Representative</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 23rd: News this afternoon is that the Japanese authorities have selected Matsuoka Yosuke as the Japanese representative to the next League of Nations General Assembly. Matsuoka has served as the President and Vice President of the South Manchuria Railway. When the Shanghai war was about to end, he acted in Shanghai as a special envoy of former Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi. He has considerable diplomatic experience and previously served in Japanese embassies abroad, and has served as an attaché in the embassies in Belgium, Russia, the United States, and China. Matsuoka is scheduled to visit the three northeastern provinces next Tuesday, and then set off for Geneva to participate in the important League of Nations meeting to discuss the report of the Investigation Team.</p>
<p>Hualian News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd: The League of Nations General Assembly, which will be held in November this year, is regarded by Japan as a watershed for war and peace. Foreign Minister Uchida, in order to induce international public opinion to favor Japan, wants to select a major figure at the prime minister level as the chief representative to Geneva. Uchida and the military department's intended figures are Shii Kikujiro, the proponent of the Asian Monroe Doctrine, or Kaneko Kentaro, an advisor to the Privy Council. His deputies would be Matsuoka Yosuke, the main proponent of annexation of Manchuria and Mongolia, and Ito Jushi, and Information Director Shiratori Toshio. In addition, Ambassador Matsudaira to the United Kingdom, Ambassador Nagaoka to France, Ambassador Yoshida to Italy, and Ambassador Sato to Belgium are also transferred as deputies. It can be said that all the prominent figures in the Japanese diplomatic world are being mobilized to Geneva to strongly argue for their theories of "distinguishing between hardness and whiteness" and to vigorously defend their policy of aggression. Matsuoka Yosuke has accepted Uchida's order to go to the Northeast to investigate various aspects of the data in order to formulate Uchida's countermeasures against the League of Nations.</p>

<p>TASS, Moscow, 22nd: The Truth Newspaper here criticized the old report sent by the Japanese United News Agency from Shenyang, pointing out that the Japanese military truck incident in Harbin on April 12 and the bombing of the Songhua River Bridge were the work of the Comintern, and published an article today to refute it. According to the report, the Japanese, having had to admit that the arrested and abused Soviet citizens were innocent, ordered the United News Agency to fabricate various stories about the activities of the Comintern. The fact that the puppet state of Manchuria, manipulated by Japanese advisors, has to use such fabricated news to cover up its embarrassment can prove that it is not in a good state. The report continued to point out that Japanese advisors, in the situation they created, have been falsely accusing places of having communist conspiracies everywhere. For example, the French company Truffel and the British company Vassart in Harbin have suffered huge losses because they were falsely accused of being centers of communist activity. Also, when the Manchurian Customs was occupied this time, Japanese newspapers falsely accused the customs office, which was mainly run by the British, of having a small communist organization. Finally, the report concluded that this stupid fabrication of the United News Agency can be said to be a culmination of fabrication and provocation, and its purpose is to cover up the actions of the Japanese army so that it can complete the occupation of Manchuria.</p>

<p>London, Reuters, 22nd – News from the Ottawa Conference is considered encouraging, and the situation in Central Europe does not appear as worrisome as before. Consequently, the stock market is very lively today, with high demand for British government bonds. German securities have also shown significant improvement.

<h3 id="e74">Public Telegram <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>To Shen Bao and all newspapers nationwide: Since the September 18th Northeast Incident, news of the tragedy has spread, filling the nation with grief and indignation. Subsequently, the Japanese invasion of Shanghai nearly impacted the national capital, causing the national populace to focus on the Shanghai Incident, thus neglecting the Northeast issue. Who knew that as we were eagerly cheering and celebrating the victory of the 19th Route Army, it was precisely the day that the Northeast Volunteer Army was fighting to the death against the Japanese on the battlefield. Now that the Shanghai Incident has ended inconclusively, the Northeast Volunteer Army continues to resist the Japanese relentlessly, yet the nation remains silent, without offering assistance. According to reports from Northeast representatives such as Ruan Ming, who have come to Guangdong, although the Northeast Volunteer Army has recently continued its efforts and achieved repeated victories, they are frequently in dire straits with exhausted ammunition and supplies. They eat coarse bran and flour to barely stave off hunger, and fight with broken guns and sand-filled bullets. Their plight is pitiful, yet their loyalty and dedication to defending the country are commendable. As fellow Chinese citizens, we cannot stand idly by. We have taken the lead in convening meetings to raise funds for assistance, but a drop in the bucket will not solve the problem. We dare to appeal on behalf of them, hoping that the entire nation will unite and rise up to provide assistance, averting a crisis at a critical moment and overcoming difficulties together. The future of the nation truly depends on it. This urgent telegram awaits a righteous response. Guangdong Province Press Association, Guangdong Provincial General Association of News Reporters, Guangzhou City News Reporters Association, respectfully.</p>

<h3 id="e75">Japanese Troops Suddenly Invade Jehol <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Xueliang Orders Northeast Armies in Beiping and Tianjin to Reinforce Jehol in Two Routes</p>
<p>Morale is High, Determined Not to Let the 19th Route Army Have All the Glory</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from Tianjin: Ten days ago, Zhang Xueliang's attention was still focused on defense in the areas of Dongguang, Daming, and Shijiazhuang. He had dispatched a certain brigade to Cixian and Zhangde and ordered a cavalry unit to Dongguang and Hengshui. Unexpectedly, while the troops were en route, the shocking news of Jehol's precariousness suddenly arrived. Zhang was well aware of Tang Yulin's attitude but believed he would be too embarrassed to change sides abruptly, so he used him to mediate and buy time. However, the Japanese had long coveted Jehol. Seeing that Tang had not expressed his stance for a long time, they could no longer wait. They used the pretext of the disappearance of military liaison officer Ishimoto Kenshiro between Chaoyang and Beipiao to advance troops into Jehol under the guise of searching, effectively carrying out a military occupation. Zhang Xueliang was quite anxious upon hearing the news. If Jehol were lost, the Chahar Province would be in danger. Although the Yuguan Pass would not be abandoned, it would be in a trap. Beiping and Tianjin would be rendered useless. He issued an emergency order at dawn on the 18th, ordering all Northeast troops stationed in Beiping and Tianjin to mobilize, arriving in Tongzhou within three days. They would then be divided into two routes, one heading to Chengde via Gubeikou, arriving within five days, and the other heading to Chaoyang County via Xifengkou, arriving within seven days. The June salaries were immediately issued. Fortunately, there were ample vehicles on the Beining Railway. Forty-one passenger and freight trains were immediately prepared, with twenty-one heading to the Jinpu Railway and twenty heading to the Pinghan Railway. As of noon today (the 21st), eighteen trains have passed Tianjin and headed to Tongzhou. Upon arriving in Tongzhou, each soldier carried [ ] bullets, a gun, and a broadsword and proceeded on foot. Supplies and ammunition were transported by trucks. The officers and soldiers wore green uniforms, the same color as the vegetation. All the soldiers were in high spirits and cheered wildly, saying, "This time we're going back to the Northeast. We won't return alive without killing the Japanese devils! We will not let the 19th Route Army have all the glory!" Last night, the reporter saw a cavalry train arrive at the main station, preparing to depart for the Northeast. Two or three soldiers bought sesame cakes from a vendor outside the station platform. The vendor, about eighteen or nineteen years old, asked the soldiers, "Where are you going, gentlemen?" A soldier replied, "To Xifengkou, to fight the Japanese!" While talking and eating, the vendor was overjoyed and begged for a pot of boiled water from a small shop outside the station to offer to the soldiers. After they finished eating, the soldier asked how much it cost. The vendor said, "A few dozen sesame cakes are worth little. I don't want the money. Gentlemen, when you defeat the Japanese and return victorious, then you can pay me!" He also said, "I want to follow you gentlemen out of the pass. It would be even better if I could join the army. If not, I'm happy to be a groom or cook." The soldiers laughed and said, "Old fellow, you wait. Tianjin will be recruiting soldiers soon. Isn't it easy to join the army?" After speaking, he gave him two dimes, boarded the train, and left. This is one incident. Troops stationed in the Hanjia Shu and Yangliuqing areas were ordered to move out, requisitioning laborers and carts to transport supplies as usual. In the past, people would panic and flee at such events, but this time, in addition to a few self-disturbing fools, most knew that it was to resist Japan and voluntarily offered their services. This is another incident. Judging from these two incidents, the patriotism of the people in the North is no weaker than that of the people in the South. It is just that they are suppressed and have no way to express their spirit.</p>
<p>The Northeast Army inside the pass consists of [ ] infantry brigades, [ ] cavalry divisions, and [ ] artillery brigades. In the past, each brigade had about 14,000 men. Since the September 18th Incident, due to financial difficulties, they have been greatly reduced in size, eliminating the weak and retaining the strong, limiting each brigade to 10,000 men. However, because the discharged soldiers have no way to make a living after retirement, most are unwilling to leave the camp. On average, each brigade has 1,000 reserve soldiers. At present, there are still [ ] 100,000 men, all of whom are well-trained veterans. It is said that the defenses in various places south of Tianjin and Baoding are temporarily filled by the armies of Pang Bingxun, Shang Zhen, and Song Zheyuan, while small units are left behind in other places to maintain治安. About 10 [ ] 10,000 men can be sent to the front line. If necessary, Jin and Sui can also send 100,000 troops. However, after the Shenyang Arsenal was occupied by the Japanese, the Northeast Army's military supplies have been greatly affected. But according to a high-ranking military officer, Zhang Xueliang actively sought to replenish them after abandoning Jin last year, and now there are enough supplies for a long-term resistance. This statement should not be false. Although the Northeast Army is now mobilized, whether it has the determination to recover the Northeast or is only defending the gateway to Jehol is what the people of the country want to know. What the reporter heard are two theories: (1) With the anti-Japanese resistance of the 19th Route Army and Ma Zhanshan, the whole country scorns the policy of non-resistance. Recently, Zhu Jiqing led the Northeast Volunteer Army to carry out a movement to restore lost territory, and there is talk of [ ] providing huge sums of money. Zhang is not a puppet, how can he not be moved? In addition, with the difficulty of military pay, the inability to survive in the Chahar and Hebei provinces, and the pressure from public opinion, the dangers of the future are felt everywhere, it is better to take this opportunity to do something to seek survival. Even if it cannot be guaranteed to win, with [ ] 100,000 troops, it can also inflict heavy damage on the Japanese army. At that time, the world will be shocked, and the negotiations with Japan may be more powerful. Moreover, at this time when the green gauze tent rises, the effect of aircraft bombing is lost, and the effectiveness of tanks and heavy artillery is also minimal. The Northeast Army is extremely familiar with the geography. If the Volunteer Army is used as a vanguard, it is the best time to resist Japan. (2) How easy is it to recover the Northeast by force? If the central government does not have a whole plan, Zhang will never have the courage to resist Japan alone. Therefore, the purpose of this mobilization is to protect Jehol. Otherwise, if Jehol is lost, Hebei and Chahar will have no danger to defend. Without the Japanese army invading, the puppet Manchurian army can also enter uninvited. Therefore, protecting Jehol means protecting Hebei and Chahar. This time, the deployment of troops on the border of Jehol is to repel the enemy if they invade. If the Volunteer Army's offensive is successful, they will also coordinate their actions and provide mutual support. These two theories each have considerable reasons. We do not know what Zhang will choose.</p>
<p>According to a certain important person, the Japanese army's desire to peep into Jehol is indeed urgent, but they also feel the difficulty of fighting in this endless green gauze tent. They only hope that Jehol will undergo changes from within, otherwise, they will wait until after the Autumn Festival, when the farmers have finished harvesting, and the land is boundless, before advancing troops to attack Jehol. Recently, the sudden disappearance of Ishimoto can be used as an excuse, so they took the opportunity to advance troops towards Chaoyang, intending to force Jehol to change. Unexpectedly, Jehol is as calm as ever, and the Northeast Army has urgently mobilized, determined to resist. From Chaoyang to Chengde, the peaks are stacked, stretching for 700 miles without any flat land. If the Japanese army attacks at this time, not only will it suffer significant sacrifices, but there is also no legitimate reason to borrow, which will only increase the bad impression of the League of Nations investigation team. Therefore, the two bombings of Chaoyang had no effect. Tang Yulin's representative in Shenyang discussed a truce with the Japanese army, promising to find a way to rescue Ishimoto. The Japanese army took advantage of the situation and temporarily suspended the attack. Shao Zifeng, president of the Beipiao Chamber of Commerce and Agriculture, went to Chaoyang yesterday to negotiate reconciliation terms. As for the conditions proposed by the Japanese army, in addition to ordering the Jehol army to be responsible for rescuing Ishimoto, there is actually a clause to eliminate the Volunteer Army. Whether there are any other harsh requirements is not yet known. (July 21st)</p>

<p>To Meet with Zhang Xueliang to Discuss Jointly Facing National Crisis</p>
<p>Shi Yousan Accompanies Him, Saying They Will Defend Against Aggression with One Heart</p>
<p>Correspondence from Jinan: Recently, with the Japanese army spying on Rehe and Yu, the situation in North China has suddenly become tense. Han Fuju, chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, believes that it is necessary to jointly plan with Pacification Commissioner Zhang Xueliang and other generals in North China to unite against aggression. He has now telegraphed the central government for permission.</p>
<p>He also invited Ge Guangting, chairman of the Jiaoji Railway Committee, to go to Beiping together. Ge boarded the train in Qingdao on the 21st and arrived in Jinan at 7:40 a.m. on the 22nd. Han and Ge departed for the north from Jinan at 8 a.m., accompanied by Zhang Liansheng, Liu Xizhong, and staff, adjutants, quartermasters, and communications personnel from the headquarters, as well as a wireless team and a pistol team. After going to Beiping, the provincial government affairs will be handled by Li Shuchun, director of the Department of Civil Affairs, with the assistance of Zhang Shaotang, secretary-general of the provincial government. The Third Route Army affairs will be handled by Sun Tongxuan, commander of the 20th Division, with the assistance of Liu Shuxiang, chief of staff of the headquarters. At 6 a.m. on the 21st, Han gathered all the section chiefs and secretaries above the department level of the various agencies in the east building of the provincial government, as well as military officers above the rank of major, and gave a sincere speech, encouraging them with the four key points of cooperation, effort, struggle, and sacrifice. At 7 a.m. on the 22nd, Han again convened a meeting in the provincial government with the directors of various departments, the commanders of various divisions, Zhang Shaotang, secretary-general of the provincial government, and Liu Shuxiang, chief of staff of the headquarters. Han reported that he had decided to go to Beiping to meet with Director Zhang and other generals in North China to discuss everything together in order to cope with the national crisis and overcome difficulties, and that it would take about a week before he could return. He hoped that everyone in Jinan would do their duty, etc. At 7:30 a.m., Han took a car to the Jinpu Railway Station, where party, government, and military dignitaries had already gathered to see him off. When Han arrived at the station, he told reporters about his mission and his position on this trip, roughly saying that resisting strong enemies externally and suppressing bandits internally are his only goals. He will fight to the death against any country that invades an inch of our land, because he has risen from the ranks to the present, and all his enjoyment is public. At this critical moment, if he does not do his best for the public, how can he bear it in his heart? Speaking realistically, if Tianjin and Beiping are in danger, how can Shandong survive alone? And the more you don't want to survive, the more you can survive. This is generally true throughout history. Now Rehe is tense and Tianjin and Beiping are serious. He intends to unite North China as soon as possible. Director Zhang (Xueliang) also sent a telegram inviting him, so he will leave immediately to discuss everything, etc. Ge Guangting, chairman of the Jiaoji Railway Committee, arrived in Jinan from Qingdao. According to him, Qingdao is calm, and he is accompanying Chairman Han on a trip to Beiping. Also going are Liu Xizhong, Zhang Liansheng, Shi Yousan, and Chai Dongsheng, a member of the Provincial Council. Mrs. Han is also going. Shi Yousan said that he is making this trip specifically to meet Director Zhang. Now that the country is in trouble, everyone must defend against aggression with one heart, and the past cannot be investigated, etc. At 8:25 a.m., the train departed for the north. (July 22nd)</p>

<p>After the bandits潰竄, they spread out along the north and south banks of the Xiang River</p>
<p>Zao City 解圍 Xu Yuanquan 封鎖 Xiang River</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: After Commander-in-Chief Chiang decided to divide into three routes勦匪, he also designated the central Hubei area as the left route, with He Chengjun and Xu Yuanquan serving as the commander and deputy commander, respectively. The route was actively deployed and began the general offensive on the 15th. The red bandits in the area were the false seventh, eighth, ninth, and third divisions of He Long's department. The officers and soldiers included the 48th Division led by Xu Yuanquan himself, the 44th Division of Xiao Zhichu, the 41st Division of Zhang Zhenhan, the 13th Division of Wan Yaohuang, and the brigades of Pan Shanzhai, Wang Yaoyu, and Liu Peixu. Compared with the bandits, they were indeed superior. Moreover, the Sichuan army troops were also in contact and could be used to夹击 at any time. Therefore, in terms of the situation, it was a rare opportunity to advance勦 at this time. After the general offensive on the 15th, fierce battles took place between the two sides at Yuxin River, Panjiadu, Zhangjie Port, Daxing Market, Qiujin River, Yangjia Market, Huibutou, and Heihe Ferry. The government forces won victory after victory, conquering key passes one after another. Unable to withstand the momentum, the bandits fled in three routes. One was a part of the false eighth and ninth divisions, led by He Long, crossed the Xiang River to the south, and fled back to the territory of Qianjiang County. The other was another part of the false seventh and eighth and ninth divisions, which was on the north bank of the Xiang River, with one part fleeing north and the other fleeing back to Zao City, intending to restore the previous front and fight the government forces for a long time. The troops stationed in Zao City were the Yu Zhaolong Brigade of the 44th Division. After receiving the report, they immediately and closely blocked the area, and another two brigades, Wang Jinyong and Chen Yong, tracked and pursued them. They defeated the bandits. According to the plane report on the 22nd, the siege of Zao City had been lifted. As for the bandits fleeing to Qianjiang, they were being attacked by the 10th Army協同川軍, and Xu Yuanquan, the commander of the 10th Army, ordered the Xiang River to be封鎖 to cut off the bandits' communication. The commander of the route, He Chengjun, flew from Hankou to Yuekou on the 21st to convene senior generals such as Xu Yuanquan, Xiao Zhichu, Zhang Zhenhan, and Wan Yaohuang to discuss everything. He returned to Han that day to report to Chiang. On the 22nd, he took a輪船 to the front to督勦. He was heard to have first visited Hanchuan because the bandits in Diaoyu Lake had been肃清, and he took the opportunity to inspect the area and urged the local authorities to handle the aftermath. After the inspection was completed, he went to Yingcheng to督师, so that the remnants of the bandits on both banks of the Xiang River would be completely殲滅. Xu Yuanquan also went from Yuekou to Zhangjie Port on the 22nd and轉赴 forward to督剿. As for the front war situation, Xu氏 had already presented it to the绥署 in a telegram on the 20th, and He Chengjun reported to all parties in a public telegram yesterday. The original telegram said, "(I) According to Deputy Commander Xu Yuanquan of the Left Route Army, who reported from Yuekou on the 20th, this morning, our Second Column had a fierce battle with the false ninth division of the bandits in the Yangjia 塲·灰埠頭 area, and the bandits were defeated, and several automatic machine guns, several迫砲s, and more than 500 rifles were captured, and more than 1,000 bandits were captured, and countless drowned in the water.

<h3 id="e79">Severe Epidemics in Henan Province <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Numerous Counties Request Medicine and Treatment</p>
<p>The Most Tragic Cases Involve Dozens of Deaths Per Day in a Single Area</p>
<p>Kaifeng Correspondence: Last year, severe epidemics raged in Henan Province, causing numerous deaths. The provincial relief association distributed medicine for treatment, and the situation gradually subsided. Unexpectedly, since the beginning of summer, the weather has been excessively hot, with outside temperatures reaching over 100 degrees Fahrenheit and indoor temperatures exceeding 90 degrees. Consequently, not only have hailstorms and rain occurred frequently, but also various plagues have broken out simultaneously. The types of diseases vary, but most are related to fever. Recently, the transmission has been rapid and deaths have been easy. Reports of epidemics and requests for medicine have been pouring in from various places. If prompt action is not taken, future outbreaks of cholera and tiger epidemics will be even more dangerous than last year's malaria. The original texts of disaster reports and requests for medicine from various places are disclosed below:</p>
<p>Song Zuduo, the county magistrate of Qinyang County, reported: Since the beginning of summer, the county has experienced torrential rains and flooding, leading to dampness and humidity, and a widespread epidemic. If no measures are taken to provide relief, the situation may become difficult to control, and the people will suffer. He recalled that the association produced medicine for epidemics last year and distributed it in the county, saving many lives. He proposed that a certain amount of the aforementioned medicine be issued to aid in treatment.</p>
<p>Wang Hongye, chairman of the Lingbao County Relief Association, reported: The area has suffered multiple disasters last year, and the people are unable to bear the burden. In February this spring, a black wind caused the crops to wither, coupled with a prolonged drought, leading to atmospheric imbalance and a major outbreak of plagues. Repeated hailstorms have destroyed the wheat harvest. With multiple disasters occurring simultaneously, the people are in dire straits. The association is responsible for disaster relief and cannot stand idly by. Therefore, he earnestly requested the association to promptly issue relief supplies to rescue the disaster-stricken people, and the entire population of Lingbao will be grateful for the great kindness.</p>
<p>Hu Yingxiang, chairman of the Fugou County Relief Association, reported: The county has a low-lying terrain, and the water disaster is particularly severe. The people have been greatly affected by dampness. Last year, malaria was discovered and persisted through the winter. This year, in May, heavy rains continued, and malaria recurred. Villagers have been coming to the association for medicine in an endless stream. The medicine previously granted by the association has already been completely distributed. Although self-made medicines such as Erfansan and Sanyin Wan have been used, the medicine is insufficient for the numerous cases, giving a sense of a drop in the bucket. He earnestly requested the association to issue medicine for treating malaria to rescue the disaster-stricken people, which would be a great blessing for the people of Fugou.</p>
<p>The Deng County Party Department wired: Epidemics are prevalent in the county, with malaria, dysentery, and summer fever being common everywhere. Poor people are unable to afford treatment, and deaths are frequently heard, which is truly distressing. He earnestly requested the prompt issuance of medicine for relief and inquired about how to apply and requested a reply.</p>
<p>Zhu Pu, the county magistrate of Zhecheng County, reported: Luo Yingcai, the director of the Zhecheng County People's Hospital, reported that with the arrival of summer, the weather is hot, and various epidemics are spreading everywhere. This is mainly due to the excessive rain and dampness last year, causing deep-seated illnesses. The director bears a special responsibility and should fulfill his duties. However, the medicine is insufficient for the numerous cases. He proposed to earnestly request the provincial relief association to issue medicine for treating measles, malaria, and other diseases to address the urgent needs. It is reasonable to submit a written request to the association, hoping that the association will grant the medicine as a matter of virtue and convenience.</p>
<p>Bo Xingmen, a representative of the people of Gong County, wrote: The county is unfortunate to have suffered continuous disasters. After the floods, there was another tiger epidemic. Those who contracted the disease experienced limb contractions, severe headaches, vomiting, and diarrhea. Within ten days, many had died. For example, in the villages west of the city, over a thousand people had died within three days. The people are panicked and do not know where to turn. He earnestly requested the prompt issuance of medicine to rescue the disaster-stricken people, which would be greatly appreciated. Zhao Minle, the county magistrate of Xiang County, reported: It has been found that an epidemic has recently occurred in Tongguan, spreading extremely rapidly. Some say it is bubonic plague, while others say it is cholera. Symptoms include vomiting, diarrhea, and swelling, with yellow water being vomited and black water being excreted. The disease progresses rapidly, with death occurring within hours. Thirty to forty people are dying daily within the city. The epidemic has now spread to the Wendi Town in the county, spreading extremely rapidly. The future is perilous. He earnestly requested the association to promptly issue a large quantity of appropriate medicine for distribution, as a matter of virtue and convenience.</p>
<p>The Luoyang Relief Association wired: Since the last ten days or so, the tiger epidemic has been rampant in the county, with hundreds of deaths per day. The Longmen and Li villages are particularly tragic. He earnestly requested the prompt donation of a large quantity of medicine for treatment, as the situation is urgent. Furthermore, the Yiluo Engineering Relief Office wired: A tiger epidemic has broken out near the office, with symptoms including vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and sometimes loss of speech. Several people are dying daily in each village, and the transmission is extremely rapid. He requested the dispatch of doctors with medicine for treatment, as the situation is urgent.</p>
<p>Wang Fashun, the county magistrate of Sishui County, reported: Since the beginning of summer, the county has experienced drought, and epidemics have been prevalent. Although active prevention measures have been taken, they have been difficult to fully implement. Recently, a type of cholera epidemic has become even more prevalent, causing severe harm. It is imperative to take preventive and control measures early to prevent the spread. He specifically submitted an official receipt, earnestly requesting the association to issue various medicines, which would be delivered to the county by the arriving personnel for relief, as a matter of virtue and convenience.</p>
<p>The Yanshi County Party Department wired: Since the beginning of summer, the county has experienced drought, and epidemics have been prevalent, with malaria, dysentery, and summer fever being common in many places. Recently, it has been found that a tiger epidemic has broken out in the urban area, with deaths occurring one after another. Poor people are unable to afford treatment and are resigned to their fate, which is particularly pitiful. Therefore, he earnestly requested the association to issue medicine for relief. He requested instructions on whether the application can be approved.</p>
<p>It is reported that after receiving reports from various places, the provincial relief association immediately hired doctors to investigate and treat the epidemic. They selected the existing medicine and distributed it to the areas most severely affected by the epidemic. They also wired the Ministry of Interior Health Department to produce and distribute epidemic prevention medicine. They also telegraphed various places, requesting donations of large quantities of relief medicine to provide as much relief as possible.</p>

<p>Silk Factories Temporarily Stop Weaving: Since the Shanghai Incident, transactions have been suspended at the silk weaving factories in the city, and the scarcity of silver has made it difficult to maintain operations. This spring, the owners of the factories had no intention of opening for business, but because the workers repeatedly requested to start weaving and were willing to reduce their wages, the factories勉强 opened for business to support the workers. Before long, the wages returned to their original state. Recently, due to the sharp drop in silk prices, the silk market has plummeted. The factories have a large stock of silk, and the losses are incalculable. Therefore, the manufacturers gathered at the Machine Industry Association the other day and resolved to temporarily stop weaving from yesterday (the 21st) until the market improves slightly, and then resume operations.</p>

Then, because there were fishing boats racing on the riverbank, the bandits suspected something was wrong and fled towards the South Gate Port. After the inspection, clothes and silver coins worth more than 200 yuan were stolen. On the 20th, two cloth vendors along Xiang Lake were stopped and searched by five bandits in the Qingshan Zhang area, and a total of 10 yuan in silver, 5 yuan in paper money, and 20 jiao in small silver coins were robbed.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education Reissues Orders to Provincial and Municipal Education Departments and Bureaus to Implement Summer Military Training in Schools: The Ministry of Education, considering that summer military training in all schools is imperative, has reissued orders to provincial and municipal education departments and bureaus, stating: "It is approved that the Training Supervisory Department has consulted and opened, and it has been found that all high schools and above should implement summer military training this year in accordance with the regulations. Previously, we have telegraphed and ordered various education administrative agencies and schools to follow suit. Recently, according to reports from military instructors in various schools, many schools have reported their implementation in accordance with the regulations, but there are also many who have used the excuse that they have not received clear orders from your department and the relevant education departments, hoping to shirk their responsibility. Such disregard for the difficulties of the times and neglect of laws and regulations is inappropriate. It is appropriate to consult and strictly order various education administrative agencies and schools to implement this year's summer training in accordance with the regulations. For schools whose students have already started their summer vacation and cannot be gathered temporarily, training can be conducted three weeks before the start of the first semester of the 21st academic year. For those who have missed too many classes due to the invasion of Shanghai by the暴日 and need to make up other subjects, military training can be conducted for 12 hours per week, with one-half for academic subjects and two-thirds for technical subjects to take both into account, etc. With this approval, it is found that this year's summer military training has been implemented repeatedly by the ministry's orders and must be carried out. Schools at all levels, if they have already started their vacation and students cannot be gathered, should be allowed to conduct training three weeks before the start of the next academic year and should not use excuses to shirk their responsibility. In addition to separate orders, we urgently order you to forward this order to all public and private high schools and above under your jurisdiction to comply."</p>

He concluded by saying, "Since last year, China has been beset by natural and man-made disasters, internal and external troubles following one after another. We young people should make use of the summer vacation to study diligently, endure hardship, and prepare to wipe out national humiliation in the future." Next, Tongji University President Hu Shuhua gave a speech, encouraging students in the following aspects: (1) cherish time; (2) save the nation through science; (3) boycott enemy goods; (4) be honest, simple, and frugal; (5) oppose civil war; (6) develop the Northwest; (7) engage in air defense drills.

<h3 id="e98">The Situation After the Restoration of Lida Academy <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The Lida Academy in Jiangwan suffered greatly when it fell into the war zone during the Japanese invasion of Shanghai. The breeding chicken farm near the racecourse was completely destroyed, and all school equipment was stolen. Later, when the 19th Route Army retreated to the second defense line, all equipment and agricultural products of the high school agricultural education department in Nantao Chaitang were also looted. The total direct losses suffered by the school in the Shanghai battle amounted to over 140,000 yuan. Fortunately, not many school buildings were destroyed, making repairs easier. After the end of the war in early May, the school's principals began the restoration work. With the support of school board members Li Shizeng, Wu Zhihui, and Yi Yincun, significant funds were raised to rebuild the school buildings and purchase school equipment at both the Jiangwan and Nantao locations. Approval was obtained from the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education to open a summer remedial class on July 1st to make up for the students' interrupted studies during the war, so that they could be promoted to the next grade as usual next semester. The initial restoration is nearing completion, with the school buildings and equipment presenting a brand new look. The spirit of teachers and students is very high. It is also reported that the school has purchased over 40 buildings on Lida Road in Yongyi Lane, preparing to expand enrollment and provide housing for faculty and staff families next semester.</p>

<p>The White Goose Painting Institute, a well-known art group formerly located on Changchun Road in North Sichuan Road, was severely affected by the January 28th Incident, as its location was in the war zone, resulting in the complete destruction of all its buildings and the dispersal of its students. Now, some students and the institute's founders, Chen Qiucao, Fang Xuegu, and Du Xueou, in order to promote communication and friendship among the students, have jointly initiated a tea party to be held this Sunday afternoon at 4:00 PM in the Guifei Hall on the second floor of the Guanshengyuan on Nanjing Road. All former students of White Goose are welcome to join.</p>

<h3 id="e100">China Youth Volleyball Tournament: Haige Wins Championship <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Defeated Czechoslovakia Yesterday</p>
<p>Result: Three Sets to Zero</p>
<p>The volleyball league organized by the Shanghai Chinese YMCA Sports Department saw ten heroic teams from Shanghai compete. For six weeks, Haige and Czechoslovakia led the first and second divisions respectively. Yesterday, the two teams met in the finals at the YMCA to determine this year's champion. Qian Yiqin was the referee, and Ling Xitao was the recorder. The match adopted a best-of-five format. As a result, Haige won three straight sets and won the championship.</p>
<p>Czechoslovakia's momentum was strong, initially taking a 6-0 lead. However, they gradually fell behind, though the difference was minimal. If they had been more strategic, Haige would have had difficulty securing victory. However, due to their lack of experience, they lost the first set 18-21.</p>
<p>In the second set, Haige became more flexible. General Cao's attack was invariably successful. However, Czechoslovakia was still able to cope. Unfortunately, in the second half of the set, their formation was disrupted, leading to Haige's pressure, and they failed again. As a result, Haige won again with a score of 21-15.</p>
<p>The third set was a life-or-death battle for both teams. Czechoslovakia's effective response made it difficult for Haige to cope. At one point, they took an 18-15 lead. However, they ultimately failed due to disorganization, which was very regrettable. As a result, Haige won again with a score of 21-18.</p>
<p>The champion team, Haige, was a mix of Fudan University and middle school students. Having fought on the field for a long time, they are famous throughout the Chuansha area. Cao Yanzan and Cheng Mingjue are national volleyball players, and their assistants on the left, right, front, and back are all top-notch. Their victory is a matter of course.</p>
<p>The runner-up team, Czechoslovakia, is the embodiment of the East Asia College of Physical Education. The entire team is well-organized and technically excellent. Their only weakness compared to Haige is their lack of experience.</p>

<p>Today at 4:00 PM</p>
<p>At the China Baseball Field</p>
<p>Chinese baseball in Shanghai has been dormant for a long time. Fortunately, with the strong efforts of Liang Fuchu and Liang Chengsong, brothers who are famous figures who returned from Japan, as well as Zhang Guozhu and Liu Dacheng, meritorious figures in Shanghai, the sport is being reorganized and revived. The former members of the Chinese team have now been recruited and are undergoing training. After two weeks, the results are quite impressive. The McKinley baseball team, a well-known team in Shanghai, has been invited to play a friendly game at 4:00 PM today at the China Baseball Field as a formal exercise. Success can be expected in the future. It is hoped that enthusiastic ladies and gentlemen will come to the field to cheer them on.</p>

<h3 id="e107">Three Associations' Swimming Instructor Mr. Yu Binqi <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Introduces Qian Yi Qin's (Swimming Training Method)</p>
<p>Yu Binqi, swimming instructor of the Shanghai Three Associations Sports Federation, introduces Qian Yiqin's (Swimming Training Method):</p>
<p>Swimming is not only a good way to cool off in the summer and an excellent life-saving technique, but also one of the most beneficial sports, allowing the whole body to develop evenly. Therefore, many people like it. However, there are also many enthusiastic learners, because few Chinese people are skilled in this field, making it difficult for those who study it carefully to find a basis, and even have no way to ask for guidance, and often give up halfway. The Qin Fen Bookstore at No. M117, Huajin Lane, Fourth Malu Road, Shanghai, promotes various sports and spares no effort. To meet the needs of those who study swimming, they have specially invited physical education expert Qian Yiqin to conduct several years of research using scientific methods and write the book (Swimming Training Method), which has now been published. The book is divided into three parts: upper, middle, and lower. The upper part describes the basic exercises of swimming and the methods and secrets of various swimming styles; the middle part is the various diving methods; the lower part is life-saving techniques. There are over 100 illustrations, indicating training methods, which are quite valuable. The whole book is beautifully bound in cloth. (The book is priced at 2.40 yuan, with a special discount of 10%. Please add 10 cents for postage. It is also available at the ticket office of the East Asia College of Physical Education swimming pool in this city.) Anyone who learns to swim will know the training methods by reading this book and can learn on their own without a teacher. This is specially introduced for promotion.</p>

<p>Japan is a Major Threat to China</p>
<p>The grass tennis league will end on the 27th of this month. Among the current situation of each team, the Chinese team is in first place, but the results have not been better than the Japanese team. The Chinese team has 66 points in six matches, while the Japanese team has 58 points in five matches. If they win the postponed match against the Xieqiao General Association by only 8-7, their score will be equal to that of the Chinese team. However, given the strength of the Japanese team, they will not stop at a score of 8-7. In the final battle between the Chinese and Japanese teams on the 27th of this month, the Chinese team must work hard. Perhaps there is still a glimmer of hope for the championship. The results are as follows:</p>

<p>The Qinghua Football Club was established in 1927. The members are all young businessmen who love sports, aiming to exercise their bodies and connect with friends in their spare time. In 1928, they participated in the China Football Federation, organized by the Chinese National Sports Association. In the spring of 1930, they won the football group championship. Currently, they are expanding their organization. Hu Guoqiao, who is enthusiastic about sports, has been supported by the members to serve as the president, and Xu Chenshu has been publicly elected as the captain, Jiang Shuomo as the vice-captain, Jin Zhixiong as the manager and accountant, Huang Guorong and Zhang Zhifang as the officers, and Wei Zhaochang as the secretary. There are currently more than 20 members, 70% of whom are businessmen, and the rest are students. After drawing 2-2 with Taiping yesterday, they held a team banquet at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA that night and invited newspaper reporters to attend. Xu Chenshu detailed the team's history, followed by a speech by President Hu Guoqiao, hoping for cooperation from the entire team and guidance from the press. Sun Daosheng and Teng Shugu replied on behalf of the team, and the meeting adjourned. The team's player list is as follows: Goalkeeper: Xu Chenshu (Inside Guard) Zheng Longfei, Zuo Yongyao (Center Back) Jiang Shuoying (Forward) Chen Yaoping, Yao Zhenggang (Forward) Huang Guorong, Fu Zhibin, Shao Jihua, Cao Qiuting, Ye Jinmian</p>

<p>Result: Each Scored Two Goals</p>
<p>Yesterday at 5:00 PM, under the setting sun and in the sight of thousands of spectators, the friendly football match between Qinghua and Taiping at the China Football Field ended in a 2-2 draw. The audience's interest was very strong, and the competition was quite intense. Although the Taiping team had famous players such as Feng Yunyou, Chen Jiaqiu, and Chen Hongguang, the talent was ultimately not as balanced as that of Qinghua. Not long after the start, Qinghua opened the scoring, winning the first goal. Taiping returned the favor a few minutes before the end of the first half, tying the score 1-1 to end the first half. During the break and resumption of the match, Taiping took advantage of the enemy's unpreparedness and charged into Qinghua's goal, scoring one goal. In the blink of an eye, Taiping was reported to have lost the defense, and the result was a 2-2 draw. Referee: Ding Zhaocheng.</p>

<h3 id="e113">Government Orders Closure of Postal Services Outside the Pass Yesterday <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>The order from Nanjing arrived at the General Post Office at 10:00 AM yesterday, immediately instructing all locations to temporarily suspend postal services in the eastern provinces. The Shanghai Post Office issued a notice not to send any more items via Siberia Railway to Europe, and instead use sea transport, according to the Far East News Agency. The Shanghai Postal Administration received a confidential telegram order from the Ministry of Transportation in Nanjing at 10:00 AM yesterday, stating that postal services in various bureaus in the eastern provinces will be temporarily closed effective immediately. Director Huang Naishu immediately ordered the bureaus in the eastern provinces to cease operations immediately, and all employees should quickly enter the Pass. He also informed postal bureaus in various provinces to notify the public not to send any more letters, packages, or remittances to the eastern provinces. Work at the General Post Office was particularly tense because of this. Although yesterday was Saturday, all employees continued to work until around 7:00 PM. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e114">Closure Ordered Due to Intolerable Harassment <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Transportation believes that recently, the Japanese have instigated rebels to plot to seize postal rights in the eastern provinces, which has gradually progressed from planning to concrete action. Recently, employees of various bureaus outside the Pass have been subjected to brutal oppression by Japanese military police and barbaric surveillance and insults by puppet prosecutors. Most recently, there was the forced issuance of pseudo-national postage stamps. Various actions have made it difficult for our various work tasks to proceed, and the lives of the staff have been experiencing extreme insecurity and threats. It is truly intolerable to be harassed any further. Therefore, with the approval of the Executive Yuan yesterday, it was decided to order the temporary closure of postal services in the eastern provinces, ordering the postal bureaus of the three provinces to cease operations immediately and withdraw all employees. The order was issued yesterday morning and arrived at the Shanghai General Post Office at 10:00 AM. Because of some confidential nature, the authorities did not allow the original text to be published.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Withdrawal of Employees and Suspension of Work <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>After receiving the telegram from the Ministry of Transportation, Director Huang of the Postal Administration immediately issued a confidential telegram, ordering employees in the eastern provinces to cease operations immediately and withdraw all personnel into the Pass, and instructed on all contingency arrangements. At the same time, it was telegraphed to postal bureaus in various locations not to receive or send any more letters, packages, or remittances to the eastern provinces.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Shanghai Post Office Issues Notice <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>In order to prevent residents from sending any more postal items, packages, and remittances to various locations in the eastern provinces, the Shanghai Postal Administration posted a notice on the glass window at the entrance at 9:30 PM last night, stating: Notice is hereby given that, as per the order of the Postal Administration, since the postal service in the three eastern provinces has undergone extraordinary changes, it has been attempting to maintain services for the convenience of the public for several months. Now, due to the circumstances, it is forced to temporarily suspend all operations of the postal bureaus in the three provinces. All drafts issued to and from the bureaus in the three provinces should be stopped. The remitting bank should retrieve the original remittance from the issuing bureau. All kinds of postal items and packages sent to various locations in the three eastern provinces will also be suspended from receipt starting from today, etc. This is hereby notified to inform the public. Postal Director Cha Peilin.</p>

<p>After the closure of the postal bureaus in the eastern provinces, mail bound for European countries via the Siberian Railway will be temporarily rerouted by sea. Once the postal bureaus in the eastern provinces return to normal, it will be transported by the original route. The General Post Office has now negotiated various transportation methods with shipping companies.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Pseudo-Delegate Fujiwara as Pseudo-Director <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Reporters from the Far East News Agency have learned from Japanese sources that, in order to ensure that the puppet state can successfully achieve the goal of seizing postal rights in Manchuria by August 1st, the Japanese government specially sent a postal expert named (Fujiwara) to Manchuria last month to actively make arrangements. The number of skilled postal staff who have been transferred to Manchuria one after another has reached more than 400. Currently, the rebel faction has officially appointed Fujiwara as the Pseudo-Manchukuo Postmaster General, and others have also been given corresponding titles.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Huang Naishu Discusses Handling of the Situation <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Huang Naishu, director of the Postal Administration, said to reporters from the Far East News Agency who visited him that the government's decision to close the postal service in the eastern provinces was truly a last resort. The Japanese instigated the puppet state to sabotage, obstruct, and threaten us, and their insidious methods can be said to be extremely unscrupulous, causing the lives of our staff in the three provinces to be in danger and making it difficult for them to work. Therefore, today, it has become intolerable, and there is only this decisive measure to take. Before the order was issued, this bureau had been ordered to arrange everything in advance. Therefore, several weeks ago, all important documents on postal affairs in the three provinces were ordered to be transported to a safe area, and all staff were also notified to be prepared to enter the Pass immediately after receiving the order. Therefore, there is no need to worry about other changes after the official order is issued today. There are about 3,000 postal employees in the three provinces. Some of the lower-level employees may not be able to be transferred into the Pass due to local relations and other reasons. However, it is expected that more than 2,500 people can be transferred back. This time, the employees will be transferred to serve in various locations. Those who cannot obtain a position temporarily will be paid their original salary and wait to be transferred back to serve after the eastern provinces are restored to their original state. As for the various losses suffered by domestic and foreign people due to this closure of postal bureaus in the eastern provinces, the responsibility should be borne by the Japanese. The reporter then asked the director whether the Japanese would overstep their authority and take over postal affairs in the Northeast in the future. Huang replied that if the Japanese disregarded international trust and took this decisive step, we would lodge a protest and seek other ways to counter it.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Song Zewen Held an Important Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Discussing the Northeast Customs Issue</p>
<p>And Will Host a Banquet for Leaders from All Sectors</p>
<p>According to the National News Agency, Minister of Finance Song Zewen arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday from Nanjing aboard the customs patrol ship "Xiaguang". Yesterday morning at nine o'clock, he summoned Commissioner of Customs Zhang Fuyun and others to his residence to discuss the issue of the seizure of the Northeast customs. The meeting adjourned at 10:40 AM. Around 4:00 PM in the afternoon, they returned to Song's residence for further discussions.</p>
<p>Participants in the Meeting Those participating in Song's meeting at 9:00 AM yesterday included, besides Song himself, three Chinese officials, including Commissioner of Customs Zhang Fuyun, and three Westerners, including a certain Director Smith of the Northeast General Customs. A total of seven people were present. The meeting commenced at 9:15 AM and concluded at 10:40 AM. Around 4:00 PM in the afternoon, Zhang Fuyun returned to Song's residence. Shortly thereafter, Deputy Minister of Finance Zhang Shouyong and Inspector General of Customs Frederick Maze also arrived. However, Zhang Fuyun left shortly after entering. When reporters met Zhang in front of Song's residence and inquired about the results of the talks, Zhang remained tight-lipped, only saying that all inquiries should be directed to Minister Song.</p>
<p>Content of the Meeting Yesterday's meeting at Song's residence was held in strict confidence, and none of the participants revealed any details. However, reporters learned from other sources that the content of the meeting concerned the imposition of taxes on all imports and exports after the blockade of the Northeast customs, with the tax collection points to be located in key areas. Therefore, the discussions yesterday likely revolved around this issue.</p>
<p>Song's Mission According to sources close to Song, his mission in coming to Shanghai is primarily to negotiate the blockade of the Northeast customs. However, it is also essential to have thorough discussions with representatives of the local banking and financial sectors regarding military expenditures for bandit suppression and the conversion from taels to yuan. Therefore, Song plans to host a banquet at his residence tonight or tomorrow night to discuss these matters with leaders from the banking and financial sectors. Director of the Currency Department Xu Kan also arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning from Nanjing by train. It is reported that Song will not stay in Shanghai for long this time. After another round of discussions with representatives from the banking and financial sectors, he will return to Nanjing.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Luo Wengan Visited the Courts Yesterday <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Returned to Nanjing in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Minister of Judicial Administration and concurrently Minister of Foreign Affairs Luo Wengan arrived in Shanghai the night before last from Nanjing. He initially intended to stay at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai office in Fenglinqiao. However, after arriving at the office at 11:00 PM, Luo found the accommodations and meals inconvenient and immediately changed his residence to the Xinxin Hotel on Nanjing Road. Yesterday morning around 8:00 AM, Luo left his residence to visit lawyer Zhang Shizhao. He then proceeded to inspect various levels of courts in Shanghai. At 3:15 PM in the afternoon, he hastily returned to Nanjing.</p>
<p>Inspection of the Courts Luo left his hotel at 8:00 AM yesterday morning for lawyer Zhang Shizhao's residence, where they talked for about an hour and had breakfast. He then accompanied Shanghai District Court President Shen Xiqing to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court in the French Concession for inspection. He was accompanied by Liang Renjie, President of the Second Branch of the High Court, to inspect the Second Special District Court on Xuehuali Road, where he was joined by President Ying of the court and others to observe the civil court trial. At 9:30 AM, he went to the Nanshi District Court for inspection, accompanied by President Shen to observe the handling of cases in various courts. Around 10:00 AM, he went to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court and the First Special District Court for inspection, where he was received by President Shen Jiayi of the Second High Court and observed the trial of cases for about 45 minutes before concluding his visit. He then returned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai office. After arriving at the office at 11:05 AM, he had lunch with the Director of the Foreign Affairs Office, Yu Ming, and then returned to his residence for a brief rest. At 2:30 PM, he ordered the Railways Bureau to prepare a train for his return to Nanjing. The Railways Bureau prepared a special M2 train. Luo arrived at the station at 2:05 PM and departed for Nanjing at 3:15 PM.</p>
<p>Luo's Remarks A reporter from the Huadong News Agency learned yesterday afternoon that Luo was going to Nanjing and immediately went to the North Station to interview him. By then, Luo had already boarded the train. He said that his visit to Shanghai was solely to inspect the courts in Shanghai and had no other purpose. He had already met with Minister of Finance Song Zewen in Nanjing and therefore did not visit him after arriving in Shanghai. He added that due to urgent diplomatic matters in Nanjing, he could not stay in Shanghai longer and was returning to Nanjing in haste. As the train was about to depart, the reporter shook hands with Luo to bid farewell.</p>
<p>Reason for the Inspection Regarding the reason for Luo's inspection of the courts in Shanghai, a reporter from the Huadong News Agency visited Xiao Jinfang, the chief clerk of the Second Special District Court, and others yesterday. They learned that Luo's inspection was due to the expiration of the agreement to recover the special district courts in the Public Concession and the French Concession on March 31 of next year. At that time, the Ministry of Judicial Administration and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will need to renegotiate the recovery methods with the relevant authorities. Furthermore, foreigners have frequently obstructed our efforts to recover judicial rights and have often attacked the courts, as evidenced by the recent case of the Russian beggar in the Second Special District Court. Such slanderous rhetoric has significantly impacted our progress in recovering jurisdiction. Therefore, Luo personally came to Shanghai to inspect whether the courts have given cause for criticism. During the inspection yesterday, Luo found the various aspects of the courts to be commendable and expressed his satisfaction.</p>
<h3 id="e122">The City Government Approved the Reduction or Exemption of Land Tax in War Zones <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Approved by the Municipal Council Meeting</p>
<p>The measures for reducing or exempting land tax in disaster areas have been reviewed and approved by the Municipal Land, Finance, and Social Affairs Bureaus after jointly dispatching personnel to conduct on-site inspections. The results of the discussions, based on the severity of the disaster, were submitted to the Municipal Government for approval, which was approved at the 208th Municipal Council meeting. The measures proposed by the bureaus will be implemented. The document submitted to the Municipal Government is as follows: It is respectfully submitted for a joint response. We received instructions No. 912 and No. 30 from your office, stating that Wu Xuen, the managing director of the Jiangwan District Disaster Relief Association, submitted a petition stating that the district was severely affected by the disaster, requesting relief and exemption from this year's land tax and past arrears. We were instructed to discuss the overall measures and plan comprehensively, and to clearly investigate the severity of the damage and submit a report with suggestions for review. While complying with these instructions, we received another instruction No. 1287 on the 14th of this month, stating that Gu Lügui, chairman of the Shanghai Disaster Area Federation, submitted a petition requesting a reduction in land tax and spring housing tax, and we were instructed to handle it together. We jointly dispatched personnel to various war zones for on-site inspections. We found that Jiangwan District was the center of the Sino-Japanese War, where the two sides confronted each other for more than a month. Houses were reduced to ruins, and villagers were displaced and had nowhere to live. Fertile fields were dug into trenches, and military roads were built. High artillery emplacements and barbed wire fences stretched for dozens of miles, leaving a desolate and miserable scene. The villages near the Paotaiwan area in Wusong District were particularly severely damaged. Houses were bombed, crops were trampled, and all livestock were slaughtered, resulting in significant losses. Yinhang District, bordering Jiangwan and Wusong, had about 70-80% of its villages destroyed by bombing. Poultry and livestock were also slaughtered and eaten. Yinxiang District was the starting point of the war. About dozens of houses in the villages at the end of Daisiwei Road were burned and looted by traitors. As for the other villages, although they appeared to be less damaged on the surface, they were practically deserted. Pengpu District, located between Jiangwan and Zhenru, was less important in terms of its terrain. Four or five villages were destroyed, and agricultural tools and livestock were lost. Zhenru District, bordering Zhabei Dachan, was also a contested area during the war. Artillery emplacements and trenches were everywhere, and the local area was devastated. After careful investigation of the above six districts, Jiangwan and Wusong Districts were the most severely affected, followed by Yinhang and Zhenru, and then Yinxiang and Pengpu. As for the other districts, although they were not directly affected by the war, their indirect losses were also significant. In addition, since the beginning of summer, there have been continuous days of rain, causing the roots of crops to rot, resulting in a sharp decline in wheat production. On the 23rd of this month, our bureau and others discussed the results and decided: (1) All districts in the city should reduce the land tax according to the severity of the disaster. (2) Jiangwan and Wusong Districts were the most severely affected and are proposed to be completely exempt from the full amount of the 21st year's summer tax (including the 20% of the summer silver that was diverted to water disaster relief in the past; this will no longer be diverted in the future). Yinhang and Zhenru Districts were less severely affected and are proposed to reduce the summer tax by 60%. Yinxiang and Pengpu Districts are proposed to reduce the summer tax by 40%. Zhabei District is entirely an urban area with less farmland and is proposed to reduce the summer tax by 30%. (3) For the remaining districts, except for Hunan and Pusong Districts, it is proposed to reduce the summer tax by 20%. (4) The remaining amount of the summer silver in each district is proposed to be postponed to the collection of the winter tax to alleviate the people's difficulties. (5) Regarding the arrears from previous years in each district, it is proposed that they not be exempted, because these arrears do not necessarily belong to the poor. If they are exempted, it would be unfair to those who have already paid, and opening this door will inevitably affect future collections. (6) Regarding the request to exempt housing tax, it has been announced by your office that housing tax in war zones will be exempted for the spring and summer seasons. As for the standards for reducing or exempting housing tax in other districts, opinions have been submitted in the case of reducing or exempting rent, which was reviewed and discussed by this finance bureau in accordance with the instructions. According to the above review, the total amount of land tax reduction is estimated to be more than 172,000 yuan. Due to the previous instructions, the Land Bureau will separately investigate and create a list of the amount of summer silver to be reduced or exempted in each disaster-affected district of the city in the 20th year and submit it in a separate document. We hereby submit the joint review and discussion of the land tax reduction measures for your review and instructions. It is in the public interest. Furthermore, this submission was drafted by the Social Affairs Bureau and jointly submitted without a seal. Respectfully submitted to Mayor Wu, Director of the Land Bureau Jin Liren, Director of the Finance Bureau Cai Zengji, and Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Wu Xingya.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Hu Jinzhong, a Soldier of the Arrested 19th Route Army, Escaped Danger Yesterday <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Describing the Inhumane Treatment He Suffered</p>
<p>Liang Fang and Two Others Are Still in Critical Condition</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, Liang Guangxin, a first-class private in the Special Service Battalion of the 78th Division of the 19th Route Army, Fang Da, a second-class private in the Second Company of the Second Regiment of the 155th Brigade, and Hu Jinzhong, a soldier of the 156th Brigade, were arrested by the Japanese army at the Osaka Wharf on the afternoon of the 19th. Hu Jinzhong escaped danger the night before last. According to Wu, the details of his escape are as follows:</p>
<p>Arrested Details Hu Jinzhong, Fang Da, Liang Guangxin, and other soldiers of the 19th Route Army, after recovering from injuries sustained during the Anti-Japanese War at the Bengbu Military Hospital, took a Jinpu train to the capital on the 15th, transferred to the Jinghu train, and arrived in Shanghai on the 17th. They were preparing to take a Dada Wharf steamer to Fujian to rejoin their unit. They stayed at a small inn at the Jinliyuan Wharf. On the afternoon of the 19th, they hired rickshaws and told the drivers to take them to the Dada Wharf, but the drivers mistakenly heard Osaka Wharf. They were seen by Japanese Marines guarding the wharf. Because they were wearing military uniforms with the 19th Route Army insignia, they were immediately arrested without explanation and beaten with rifle butts, causing injuries all over their bodies. They were then imprisoned in a large oil drum by the Huangpu River at the Osaka Wharf, guarded by Indian police and Japanese soldiers in charge of the wharf. They were not given food or drink, and were subjected to all kinds of harsh treatment, which was inhumane.</p>
<p>Escape Details Hu Jinzhong is from Hengzhou, Hunan, and is 16 years old. He was less severely injured. Fang Da was the most seriously injured, with his left arm broken. Liang Guangxin was unable to move due to his injuries and his life was</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>was in critical danger. They were sure to suffocate or starve to death in the drum. On the night of the 22nd, Hu Jinzhong saw that the Indian police in charge of the wharf were far away, and the Japanese Marines guarding them were all drunk. He seized the opportunity to climb out and fled to the tram company factory in the Public Concession on Yangshupu Road. At dawn, he was seen by workers who, after hearing the details of his arrest and abuse by the Japanese army, pleaded for rescue and transfer to the Public Security Bureau.</p>
<p>Escorted to the Bureau A coppersmith at the tram company reported to the Chinese employees of the company. After questioning him in detail, fearing that he would be discovered by the Japanese army, they took off Hu Jinzhong's military uniform and insignia and gave him a set of student clothes to disguise himself. The workers gave him food and drink. Yesterday morning at 8:00 AM, a Chinese employee took him by car to the Fifth District Police Station in Zhabei and gave him four silver dollars. District Chief He Yiming inquired in detail about his arrest and abuse. Because the matter concerned the Japanese army detaining and insulting our soldiers, which was a serious matter, he prepared a document and sent police to protect him and take him by car to the Public Security Bureau headquarters at 10:30 AM yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Temporary Residence at the Bureau Public Security Bureau Chief Wen Yingxing, after receiving a report that Fang Da and other soldiers of the 19th Route Army were detained and insulted by the Japanese army, was secretly investigating the matter. Yesterday, after receiving a report from the Fifth District, he sent Section Chief Wang Zhijing of the Second Section to question him in detail. It was reported that he also sent Hong Qi, the director of the Foreign Affairs Division, to accompany the escaped soldier Hu Jinzhong to the Japanese Consulate at 1:00 PM to investigate the truth. The Japanese Consul shirked responsibility, claiming that the matter was under the jurisdiction of the Marines and only agreed to send personnel to question the Marines. At the same time, the Public Security Bureau reported the details of Hu Jinzhong's escape to the Municipal Government. Currently, Hu Jinzhong is temporarily residing at the Public Security Bureau headquarters.</p>
<h3 id="e124">The Noulens Requested a Transfer of Jurisdiction Again <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Requesting That the Shanghai High Court Branch Hear the Case</p>
<p>The Noulens previously petitioned the Supreme Court to transfer jurisdiction to the Shanghai-Jiangsu High Court Branch, but the petition was rejected. Yesterday, their attorney submitted another petition. The original petition is as follows: Regarding the continued request for a transfer of jurisdiction, the issue of jurisdiction in this case has raised doubts. After submitting a petition to your court requesting a transfer, it has now been rejected, stating that the original petition's claims are purely objections to jurisdiction and do not explain whether the original trial court has the circumstances listed in Article 21 of the Criminal Procedure Law, so it is difficult to consider it reasonable. Although this ruling cannot be appealed according to law, there is no limit to the number of requests for a transfer of jurisdiction. Even after a rejection, if it is still believed that there are circumstances under Article 21 of the Criminal Procedure Law, it is permissible to continue the request (see the explanation of Article 415 of the Criminal Procedure Collection). The reasons for the continued request for a transfer of jurisdiction are stated as follows: (1) All legal provisions have both a principle and an exception. The so-called principle is the provision that must be applied as a matter of course and is not allowed to be changed without reason. The so-called exception is a temporary remedy adopted when the provisions of the principle cannot be applied in fact due to special reasons. Therefore, in applying the law, the provisions of the principle should be absolutely observed. Only when the provisions of the principle are impossible to apply in fact, it is not allowed to abuse the exception and distort the meaning. One is an absolute and obvious definition, while the other is a relative and accidental variation. (2) The only legal court of first instance in this case, according to Article 13 of the Criminal Procedure Law and Article 1 of the Implementation Regulations for the Punishment of Crimes Endangering the Republic of China, should obviously belong to the Shanghai High Court Branch. The Jiangsu High Court had no jurisdiction from the beginning. Later, due to the transition of military institutions, it was repeatedly transformed. The Ministry of Judicial Administration, through administrative procedures, did not return the case to the Shanghai High Court Branch of original jurisdiction, but arbitrarily ordered it to be handed over to the Jiangsu High Court for jurisdiction (see the last line of page 2 of the indictment). Even if there are slight reasons to justify this, it must be recognized as an exceptional variation, not as it should be in principle. There is no doubt that the petitioner's request to transfer the case from an exceptional and illegal court to a court of principle and legality is for the sake of absolute respect for Chinese law and has no other effect. If the petitioners are guilty, the Shanghai High Court Branch will also be able to enforce the law and will never let them go unpunished. How could it damage the dignity of Chinese justice? Now, the court with original jurisdiction firmly insists that it has no jurisdiction, while the court with no jurisdiction from the beginning insists that it has jurisdiction. Furthermore, it fails to explain why the Shanghai High Court Branch has no jurisdiction and whether there are reasons under Article 21 of the Criminal Procedure Law if it has jurisdiction. This is enough to cause suspicion. Moreover, the trial is held in Nanjing, which is not only inconvenient for the petitioners but also not convenient for the court's staff. There is also no explicit basis in the Criminal Procedure Law and the Court Organization Law. This is what the petitioners are greatly confused about. (3) Since the provisions of Article 21 of the Criminal Procedure Law are an exceptional remedy, if the Shanghai High Court Branch found that the special circumstances listed in that article made it impossible to apply Article 13 and Article 1 of the Implementation Regulations for the Punishment of Crimes Endangering the Republic of China, which are prescribed in principle, the branch would have automatically requested your court to designate a transfer, without waiting for the request of a military institution. The parties in this case would have also requested a transfer long ago. Not only do the parties absolutely recognize the branch as the only legal court to accept the case and have never raised any objections, but the branch itself has never indicated that it has any reason to be without jurisdiction. There has also been no ruling from your court designating a transfer. The transfer was only approved due to the request of a military institution. After the military institution recognized that it had no jurisdiction, it should have been returned to the Shanghai High Court Branch of original jurisdiction for continued acceptance. This is undoubtedly obvious in theory. However, instead of returning it to the original trial court, it was transferred to the Ministry of Judicial Administration. The procedure was extremely wrong, as the Ministry of Judicial Administration is not an agency for accepting litigation cases. Unexpectedly, the Ministry of Judicial Administration not only did not refuse to accept it and order its return to the original trial court, but ordered it to be handed over to the Jiangsu High Court, which was not the original trial court, after accepting it. Is this not one mistake after another? The Shanghai High Court Branch, because the Ministry of Judicial Administration is its superior administrative agency, was unable to protest. The Jiangsu High Court Branch also believed that it was an order from a superior administrative agency and was unable to refuse. They tolerated each other, and a great mistake was made. If the Ministry of Judicial Administration had been able to order the Shanghai High Court Branch of original jurisdiction to continue accepting the case in accordance with the law, the petitioners are confident that the branch would have had no objections. (4) Looking at the overall situation, all requests that are beneficial to the petitioners are strictly interpreted according to the provisions, fault-finding, and are rejected. The language is righteous and the words are strict, and no consideration is given at all (for example, the petitioners' defense attorney, in order to verify the handwriting on the evidence, requested permission to take photographs, but the request was rejected, stating that there was no legal basis. However, Article 175 of the Criminal Procedure Law stipulates that the defense attorney may inspect the case files and evidence objects and may copy the case files. The method of copying may be with a brush, pen, pencil, copying, or photography, and there is no strict restriction. Moreover, it is necessary to photograph in order to carefully review the handwriting, except for the original. Under these circumstances, the judge, for the sake of the parties' interests, may use his discretion to allow it. However, because the word "photography" is not explicitly mentioned in the law, it is said that there is no legal basis. The petitioners truly do not know why this case, which should be kept secret before the investigation, has all the evidence photographed and published in Chinese and Western newspapers for widespread publicity. Furthermore, it is not known in which law it is stipulated that evidence can be photographed and published in newspapers before the investigation.) All matters that are unfavorable to the petitioners, on the other hand, are not spared from violating the provisions of the principle, but instead distorting the provisions of the exception to accommodate them, and even sometimes there is no basis for the exception (such as borrowing the Nanjing court). The reason for this is nothing more than that Nanjing is the political center. Under the influence of this political power, there are all kinds of conveniences to directly control the judiciary, to surround the judiciary with the political environment, and to lose the independent spirit of free exercise. Under these special circumstances, can the petitioners still expect a fair trial? This is the petitioners' distress that they have to continue to request that the Shanghai High Court Branch continue to accept the case. (5) In principle, the Shanghai High Court Branch should have jurisdiction over the first instance in this case. Since there are no circumstances under Article 21 of the Criminal Procedure Law, there is no basis for a transfer. As for the interpretation of the four words "original trial court," your court now distorts them from a changing standpoint and refers to the Jiangsu High Court. However, the petitioners always refer to the Shanghai High Court Branch from the original standpoint. Therefore, although the current request is for a transfer of jurisdiction in name, it is actually only a request to restore the original state and return the case to the Shanghai High Court Branch for continued acceptance. In short, this case is of great importance. The petitioners do not reject the trial of a legal court, but believe that the court should consider the law and the interests of the petitioners in every way. They certainly do not want it to violate the principles of the law, distort the provisions of the exception, or even have no provisions to cite, only to deliberately inflict great harm on the petitioners and deprive them of the rights they should enjoy according to the law in order to accommodate the government. It has been like this in the past, and it can be known in the future. However, the petitioners still hope that the court will not damage its own solemn and sacred spirit, its own bright and upright attitude, and its own weaknesses of compromising and catering to the world because of the petitioners. To further explain that the circumstances stated in Article 21 of the Criminal Procedure Law do indeed have the risk of unfairness, they continue to request your court to approve the transfer of the current illegal jurisdiction and return it to the Shanghai High Court Branch for continued acceptance in accordance with Article 22 of the same law with the spirit of utmost fairness. Respectfully submitted to the Supreme Court, July 23, 21st year of the Republic of China, by the petitioners Noulens and Wang Deli, attorneys Chen Ying and Pei Si.</p>

<p>According to the Japanese-language "Shanghai Daily News," Song Qingling has stated that the arrested Noulens are not the real Noulens. They are actually Noulens' secretary, Niu Yi. When Niu Yi was arrested, he feared being subjected to the death penalty, so he impersonated Noulens himself. Therefore, various parties are paying close attention. However, the Chinese judicial authorities believe that regardless of whether they are real or fake, they will still be tried according to the law and will not change their position in the slightest because of</p>

<p>Cheng Changkui, the commander of the Mongolian border cavalry, previously sent representatives Huang Zhendong, Li Yingkai, Zhuang Tianmin, and others to Shanghai to petition the Shanghai Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association for assistance. Now that the situation in Rehe is becoming increasingly tense and they urgently need to return to their defenses and face the national crisis together, they have sent a letter to the Volunteer Army Support Association, stating:</p>
<p>Letter from the Representatives Dear Sirs, We, the representatives dispatched by our commander to Shanghai to request assistance from your association, have been informed that you have agreed to provide full assistance. We should have waited patiently for the planning. However, we have recently seen reports in the newspapers that the Japanese army is attacking Rehe and the situation is serious. Our troops are located in the vital area of Liaoning and Rehe, and we fear that we may have already made contact with the enemy. Therefore, the representatives have been burning with anxiety and longing to return to our posts. We are sending this letter to request your association to provide full assistance as soon as possible so that we can return to our original defenses, boost morale, and wipe out the Japanese bandits. We look forward to hearing from you and granting our unusual request. Sincerely, Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association.</p>
<p>Reply from the Support Association After receiving the letter from the Volunteer Army Support Association, they replied based on a letter from Zhu Jiqing, stating: Dear Sirs, We have received your letter of July 21 and understand its contents. The emergency in Rehe and the crisis in North China have caused us great anxiety. Regarding the matter of providing assistance to your army, we received a reply from Mr. Zhu Jiqing, which stated: "According to the representatives of Commander Cheng, they do not need economic assistance, but only request assistance with bullets." The shortage of bullets is a common phenomenon in the Northeast Anti-Japanese Army. Jiqing is currently making every effort to raise funds in Nanjing. The results are uncertain, but he has already told the representatives that no matter how much or how little, it will first be distributed to the Anti-Japanese Army in the Liaoxi area, which is of greater importance, according to the number of firearms. In addition, regarding the fundraising for military uniforms, our army has already sent letters to the Federation of Citizens' Associations in the First District, the Federation of Commercial Circles on Nanjing Road, Shenxin Textile Company, Shanghai Printing and Dyeing Company, and the Cotton Cloth Industry Association, and other places to solicit donations. However, we have not yet received a reply. As soon as we have any information, we will inform you again. Please be aware of our thoughts. Sincerely, To Li, Huang, and Zhuang, the three representatives.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Abolish the Civil War Alliance Welcomes Representatives to Guangdong <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Guangdong Authorities Express Understanding</p>
<p>Hong Kong and Macau Residents Warmly Welcome</p>
<p>The preparatory committee of the Abolish the Civil War Alliance sent representatives Mr. Zhu Qinglan, Mr. Chen Liting, and Mr. Zha Liangzhao to Guangdong for consultations. Having completed their mission, they returned to Shanghai. The preparatory committee held a meeting at 7 PM last night at No. 4 Hong Kong Road to welcome the three representatives and hear their report on the consultations. Attendees included Zhu Qinglan, Chen Liting, Zha Liangzhao, Wang Xiaolai, Xu Jiqing, Liu Zhanen, Qian Xinzhi, Chen Zheqing, Lin Kanghou, Qin Runqing, Yan Esheng, and others. Wang Xiaolai delivered a welcoming speech, followed by the three representatives reporting on their experiences. They stated that their trip was very positive, and the people of Hong Kong and Guangdong showed warm sympathy and deep hope for the abolition of civil war. They believed that with concerted efforts and unwavering determination, success would eventually be achieved. The reports of the three representatives are summarized below:</p>
<p>Zhu Qinglan's report on the consultations: Upon arriving in Hong Kong on the 11th, they were warmly welcomed by various organizations and the public. In addition to explaining the reasons for initiating the Abolish the Civil War Alliance, its organizational process, and participating groups at the welcoming meeting, they also met with key figures such as Hu Hanmin, Sun Ke, Cai Tingkai, Chen Ce, and Zhang Huichang. They stated that the national crisis was urgent, and domestic wars should not continue. They advocated for unity against foreign aggression. The results were generally satisfactory. On the morning of the 14th, upon arriving in Guangzhou, they were welcomed at the pier by representatives of public organizations. After landing, they separately visited key military and political figures such as Tang Shaochuan, Li Zongren, Chen Jitang, Lin Yunga, Xiao Focheng, and Lin Yizhong, as well as leaders of local public organizations, explaining the mission of their trip. They received understanding and support from all parties. On the morning of the 15th, at the invitation of Zhong Rongguang, they visited Lingnan University. At 11 AM, they attended a welcome meeting at the Guangzhou Lingnan Club. At noon, they attended a banquet hosted by Chen Jitang. At 3 PM, they attended a joint welcome meeting at the Fangbian Hospital and various charitable organizations. At 4 PM, they attended a tea party held by the Guangzhou All-Circles National Salvation Fundraising Committee. At 5 PM, Lin Yunga hosted a banquet. At 6 PM, they attended a banquet hosted by Li Zongren. At 7 PM, they attended a welcome meeting hosted by the Silver Industry Association. At 8 PM, they gave a speech at the YMCA. At 12 AM, they returned to the Asia Hotel and met with student representatives. All speeches and remarks made at the various gatherings focused on the abolition of civil war as the only way to unite against foreign aggression. During the banquet hosted by Chen Jitang, all senior military and political figures were present. They were open and frank, expressing their views without reservation. Chen first explained the situation in Guangdong and then inquired whether the Abolish the Civil War Alliance had any political background. After the representatives explained that the abolition of civil war was a purely patriotic movement aimed at uniting against foreign aggression and had no political purpose, the authorities expressed their understanding. The Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce is now leading the Abolish the Civil War Alliance in Guangzhou. With their mission completed, the representatives took a ship from Guangzhou to Foshan on the 16th and then returned to Shanghai via Macau. In conclusion, the trip gave the representatives the feeling that the abolition of civil war movement, if carried out with determination and unity by the entire nation, with purity and effort, would surely achieve good results.</p>
<p>Chen Liting's Explanation of Civil War: Representative Chen Liting explained the meaning of "civil war" at the banquet hosted by Chen Jitang, stating that the establishment of the Abolish the Civil War Alliance stemmed from the patriotic aspirations of the four major commercial organizations in Shanghai. They firmly believed that during this time of national crisis, stopping civil war and uniting together was essential to save the perilous situation and strengthen the country. Otherwise, the nation would be doomed. The alliance was not being used by anyone or acting as a military background for anyone, nor was it a tool for anyone's personal gain. In simple terms, "civil war" referred to any act of possessing troops for self-defense, harming the country and the people, prioritizing personal interests over the well-being of the people, and dividing territories, thereby causing civil war. However, suppressing bandits and communists was the responsibility of the military and political authorities and should not be considered civil war. The judgment of this type of discussion should be sought from public opinion. The alliance has decided to convene a representative assembly in Shanghai to discuss concrete explanations and measures in detail. This is the explanation of "civil war."</p>
<p>Zha Liangzhao's Report on Public Enthusiasm: Representative Zha Liangzhao reported that the warm welcome from the people in Hong Kong, Guangdong, and Macau was deeply moving. It showed that the abolition of civil war was the unanimous desire of the entire nation. Banners reading "Welcome Peace Envoys" were displayed at the piers, and large firecrackers were set off. Hong Kong newspapers published news of the representatives' trip to Guangdong with large headlines covering multiple pages and editorials expressing their hopes. Detailed accounts were given of the trips from Hong Kong to Guangdong and back to Hong Kong. After returning to Hong Kong, at the urging of overseas Chinese in Macau, they took the Zhongxing ship to Macau on the 17th. The warm welcome in Macau was no less enthusiastic than in Hong Kong. All shops displayed national flags. Upon arrival, representatives from the Chamber of Commerce, the Education Association, and other organizations, along with overseas Chinese, gathered at the pier to welcome them. A welcome meeting was held at the Chamber of Commerce. Chairman Fan Jieming delivered a welcoming speech, stating that the abolition of civil war had long been supported by the people, and overseas Chinese were eager to follow and contribute to its implementation. Mr. Zhu responded on behalf of the group, stating that foreign aggression was becoming increasingly urgent, and the Northeast and Shanghai had suffered greatly from the war. Commerce had plummeted, and the people felt that they could not survive unless they stopped the civil war and united against foreign aggression. Therefore, the four organizations in Shanghai initiated the Abolish the Civil War Alliance, which now had 494 participating organizations.

The alarming news has caused great shock. The three northeastern provinces were lost to foreign lands due to Mr. Zhang's policy of non-resistance, and 30 million compatriots have become people of a subjugated nation. Rehe is the throat of North China. If it falls into the hands of the violent Japanese, Pingjin will be lost and the nation will be destroyed imminently. However, Mr. Zhang has not shown any active planning to resist this crisis. (Omitted) If Mr. Zhang can immediately realize the situation, lead troops to aid Rehe, and recover the Northeast in one fell swoop, it will not only wash away the previous guilt but also be a great hero of the Republic of China. We urge Mr. Zhang to take action quickly. Shanghai Various Organizations' National Salvation Joint Conference.</p>

<p>Two Western Police Officers Perform Their Duty to Provide Assistance</p>
<p>A Certain Western Woman Righteously Argues</p>
<p>Zhu Ashun, a 64-year-old resident of Pudong, runs a milk shed and sells cattle in Yangjiadu, Pudong, earning a good income. Zhu has a sworn friend named Xiang Gou, who runs the Shunxingyuan hot water stall at the intersection of Miller Road and Hankow Road in Hongkou. He has considerable influence in the Hongkou area. Cattle entering and leaving the surrounding villages must go through his hands, or else troubles will inevitably arise later. However, he is a generous and chivalrous man, so people enjoy associating with him. Yesterday morning, Zhu led a calf from Pudong to Xiang Gou's place and sold it for 11 silver dollars. Because of their long-standing friendship, Xiang Gou invited him to lunch before returning. However, Zhu insisted on declining because he was anxious to cross back to Pudong. When he was passing the Xiaocaichang intersection of Miller Road and Wenjianshi Road, a Japanese naval military vehicle suddenly sped by. Zhu was unable to avoid it in time and was knocked to the ground, suffering a severe head injury. The Japanese soldiers in the vehicle, seeing the accident they had caused, immediately jumped out, and two Japanese soldiers carried the injured person onto the vehicle, intending to transport him elsewhere and leave him for dead. Although a police officer on duty witnessed everything, he was too timid to step forward and perform his duty. Two Western police officers happened to be patrolling nearby, and a Chinese police officer reported the details. Seeing that the vehicle had not gone far, the two Western police officers quickly gave chase and negotiated with the Japanese soldiers. As a result, they escorted the vehicle to the entrance of the Tongren Hospital. When the two Western police officers contacted the hospital, the hospital sent a head nurse, a certain Western woman, leading two staff members, and they pushed a stretcher to the side of the road, intending to transfer Zhu Ashun to the stretcher. However, the Japanese soldiers in the vehicle firmly refused to let the injured person down. The Western woman argued strongly and, together with the staff members, forcibly dragged the injured person onto the stretcher. The military vehicle then drove north. The Japanese's hostility towards the Chinese people is evident here.</p>
<h3 id="e131">The Murder of Wen Ying <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Fan Hongsheng Still Attempts to Frame Others</p>
<p>Will Be Tried Together with Diaoyukeke</p>
<p>After the murder of the female physiognomist Wang Wenying, her teacher, the male physiognomist Diaoyukeke (Cheng Meixian), was suspected of being heavily involved. The police arrested Cheng and took him to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention, as reported in this newspaper. The main culprit, Fan Hongsheng (also known as Fan Ruibao, a 24-year-old from Nanjing), escaped. Although the police were actively pursuing him, he was still not captured. Yesterday morning, old ward police officer You Agen, Su Changsheng, and patrol officer Zhou Guisheng arrested Fan's mother, Mrs. Chen, at No. 1837 Peng Road. Under questioning, they learned that her son Hongsheng was hiding at his sister's residence at No. 965 Jiaotong Road, Zhabei. Officer You and others, together with officers from the Fourth District Public Security Bureau, rushed to the address and arrested him. They found 70 silver dollars and a train timetable (cut from a newspaper) in his pocket. They immediately took him back to the police station. At that time, Fan's nerves seemed to be slightly disturbed.</p>
<p>He loudly sang the "July 7th Small Tune", involving Wenying and himself in the tune. He was then taken into custody, and Mrs. Fan Chen was released. Yesterday morning, the police escorted Fan to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court, where he was interrogated by Criminal Judge Qian Hongye. Fan Hongsheng hired lawyer Jiang Baoli as his defense counsel. First, police lawyer Ru Baoyi presented the case (previously reported, omitted) and stated that in addition to</p>
<p>Wang Wenying's murder, Wang's mother, Mrs. Wu, was also injured. Therefore, the police filed a public prosecution in accordance with Article 284, Paragraph 1 of premeditated murder and Paragraph 3 of attempted crime. Furthermore, the defendant was previously sentenced to two months' imprisonment by the court on April 28 of last year for</p>
<p>consuming opium and was released on July 7. However, this case also involves Cheng Meixian, who has already been interrogated once by the court and rescheduled to the 27th of this month. Therefore, this case should also be rescheduled and tried together with Cheng Meixian. Subsequently, Officer You submitted a report on the arrest of the defendant, and Chen Ajin testified that she was a servant in Wenying's household and that the defendant did not come often, only once the day before the incident. He came again that</p>
<p>morning and again in the afternoon. Seeing me in the room, he ordered me to buy cigarettes with a two-corner coin. However, the coin was made of lead, so I returned home to exchange it. Then</p>
<p>Miss fell to the ground and died. At that time, only Fan was in the room with Miss and her mother. I was not at the scene when the incident occurred. In addition, Pan Changfu, the coachman of Wenying's second landlord Yang Zhiyi, testified that after the incident, he saw Wang Wu chase after the defendant and that he also helped chase after him, but they suddenly disappeared in Daqing Lane. Subsequently, Fan Hongsheng's mother, Mrs. Fan Chen, testified that the 70 silver dollars found on the defendant were given to him by his sister to buy clothes because he had completely torn all his clothes. The court then ordered that the confiscated 70 silver dollars be returned to Mrs. Fan Chen. When questioned, Fan Hongsheng confessed that he had known Wang Wenying for</p>
<p>a month and that no one had introduced them. That day, I went with another person named Cheng Wenqin, not Cheng Meisheng. The murder was committed by two people together. When escaping, I went out the front door, and he went out the back door. Police lawyer Ru immediately stated that the Cheng Wenqin mentioned by the defendant had been investigated by the police and found to be working with the defendant at the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Station. Because they had a grudge, he falsely accused him. In reality, there was no relationship. The court then questioned Fan about whether he had previously been sentenced to two months' imprisonment for smoking opium. Fan replied yes. Ru Lawyer immediately requested the court's attention, saying that Fan was still</p>
<p>matter, it can be seen that his brain is still . The court should ask the clerk to record it in the minutes. Judge Qian then ordered the defendant to be taken into custody. This case will be rescheduled for further hearing.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Hong Pinxuan Forcibly Divorces <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Falsely Claims Mother-in-Law is Ill and Comes to Shanghai</p>
<p>Privately Asks Hotel and Pier to Abandon</p>
<p>Shi Cuiying, a woman from Zhoushan, 21 years old, married Hong Pinxuan, a native of Ningbo, through a matchmaker in March last year. After getting married, they lived together in the Wang Guxing clothing store, Huacui , Ti'ao Bridge, Hongkou, North Shanghai. This year, Hong, for some unknown reason, treated Cuiying like a thorn in his side. If she slightly disobeyed him, she would be beaten. On the 17th of this month, Cuiying's mother, Shi Hu, suddenly received a letter from her son-in-law, Hong Pinxuan, in her hometown, saying that Cuiying was seriously ill and asking her to come to Shanghai immediately. Ms. Shi took a ship on the 21st and rushed to Hong's house. Cuiying was surprised to see her and asked why she had come to Shanghai in such hot weather. Ms. Shi told her everything, and Cuiying realized that someone must be playing a prank. However, she did not investigate further. Until about 3 PM the day before yesterday, Hong suddenly invited Ms. Shi to visit a hotel. Ms. Shi did not suspect anything and followed him. After arriving at a certain room in the hotel, not long after sitting down, several of Hong's friends suddenly broke into the room. At Hong's greeting, they took out a divorce agreement and said sternly to Ms. Shi, "Now, I and Cuiying have disagreements, so I want to end the relationship. I will marry another wife later, and Cuiying must not interfere. If she marries another man, she must compensate me for a loss of 200 yuan." "The divorce agreement is already here, but I am afraid there are no witnesses, so I falsely claimed that Cuiying was seriously ill and specially sent a letter urging you to come to Shanghai and invited so many friends. Please sign this divorce agreement now, otherwise, I will send you to your death immediately." Ms. Shi initially said to Hong, "Why is my daughter not good? If you want to divorce her, I cannot sign it casually now." However, after being repeatedly threatened by Hong and others, Ms. Shi, being ignorant and fearful, signed the agreement. That night, she was placed under house arrest in the room. After Cuiying was separated from her mother, she did not see her return. Later, Hong returned home, and Cuiying immediately asked about her mother's whereabouts. He said, "Because she was playing around and was tired, she is sleeping in the hotel. She is going back to her hometown tomorrow. I told you to go to the pier to see her off." Cuiying asked again, "Since my mother is going back to her hometown, why doesn't she come here for a while?" Hong said, "I really don't know." After one night, Hong called Cuiying to the pier yesterday to see her off. He called together many friends and used a car to send Cuiying to the Dada Pier in Nanshi. Cuiying did not see her mother and became suspicious. Hong changed his words and said, "I will go pick up your mother." Not long after, her mother did come. Hong then changed his expression and said to Cuiying, "Now your mother has already written the divorce agreement for us. From now on, we will go our separate ways." After saying that, he left. Cuiying was stunned after hearing this and explained what had happened the night before. Cuiying was greatly angered by Hong's treachery and shouted again and again, and immediately wanted to commit suicide by throwing herself into the river. Her mother immediately hugged her and cried, "Do you want to die? Okay, I will come with you." At that time, a police officer from the First District Police Station heard about it and rushed to pull them apart and took them back to the district. During the preliminary hearing, the mother and daughter explained what happened. As the matter concerned a marital dispute, they were instructed to prepare a document and send it to the bureau for review.</p>

However, Mr. Ma needs to go to West Lake to recover from his lung disease, so he will transfer to Hangzhou.</p>

<p>The National Goods Factory Union telegraphed Zhang Xueliang yesterday, saying that the violent Japanese are taking an inch and wanting a mile. They previously occupied the Northeast and lost important places due to no resistance. Now they are spying on Rehe. If they still procrastinate and do not send troops immediately, how can they live up to the government's determination to resist for a long time, and how can they live up to the public's idea of ​​when will they lose? Please send reinforcements quickly to meet the enemy, so as to freeze the enemy's guts and maintain the territory. The telegraph cannot be overstated,</p>
<p>The National Land Problem Research Association issued two important telegrams for the Japanese army's invasion of Rehe yesterday. The original text is as follows: (1) To the National Government Telegraph, Nanjing National Government Executive Yuan Military Commission Jian, Japan is attacking Liao again and using the old tricks, constructing the Ishimoto incident, and invading Rehe on a large scale. Tianjin is shaken, Rehe is the key to the north, protecting Rehe is to protect Tianjin, and protecting Tianjin is to save the Northeast. Please ask the government to lead the teachers and students and actively resist. Urgent request, no matter what, the International Problem Research Association kowtows, (2) To the Secretariat of the International League of Nations Telegraph, The Japanese army's invasion of Rehe has made the situation in Manchuria more serious. We urge the alliance to take effective measures to make Japan respect the resolutions of the League of Nations it recognizes, so as to ensure the integrity of China's land. (Omitted below)</p>
<h3 id="e135">The Work of the Chinese Representative Office of the Investigation Team <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Jin Wensi's Conversation Before Going North</p>
<p>Mr. Jin Wensi of the Chinese Representative Office of the League of Nations Investigation Team came to Shanghai at the beginning of the month. Now that the investigation team has returned to China from Japan, Mr. Jin was urged by Mr. Gu to go north by telegram. He took the Swatow wheel of Taikoo Company with his wife and two sons yesterday morning (23rd). This newspaper reporter visited Mr. Jin on the boat and asked about the work of the representative office in the past and in the future. I was informed of the respective answers below. Mr. Jin said, in addition to reception and general affairs, the most important part of the representative office's work is the preparation and translation of the statement of argument, as well as the meeting with the investigation team and the discussion and research of specialized issues. Regarding the part of the statement of argument, two cases were submitted in April, one is a general statement of argument, which summarizes China's position on the Sino-Japanese dispute, and the other is a statement of argument on the issue of parallel lines in the South Manchuria Road, but at that time the investigation team was going to Beijing and Hankou under the leadership of Shanghai. After arriving in Ping, the pseudo-country put forward the problem of refusing Gu, and the group tried to deal with it with Japan, and then went to the Eastern Province for on-site investigation, and Representative Gu accompanied them everywhere from Shanghai to the Eastern Province, so there was no time to take care of the preparation of other statements of argument. Before leaving the customs, Representative Gu assigned the various statements of argument to be submitted to the various commissioners for drafting, and the drafting of each commissioner took more than a month. After the investigation team returned to Ping in early June, Representative Gu carefully reviewed each statement of argument and submitted them to the group separately. This statement of argument can be roughly divided into three categories: (1) Regarding the situation of Japan's aggression, all the circumstances of the Eastern Incident this time, the circumstances of the Japanese army in places outside the Eastern Province seeking trouble, the massacre of overseas Chinese in Korea and the Wanbaoshan case, and other political and economic aggressions are included. (2) Regarding the legal position, in addition to detailing in the general statement of argument how Japan violated the Covenant of the League of Nations, the Non-War Convention, the Nine-Power Treaty, and international law, regarding the four-article treaty generated by Article 21, according to the advocacy of our country in the two meetings of the Paris-Washington Conference, especially according to the legal effect of the parliament's denial of the treaty, it is advocated to amend and abolish the issue of parallel lines. We declare that our country has no obligation not to build parallel lines in the treaty. For the issue of the South Manchuria Road Patrol, we declare how Japan violated the treaty and did not withdraw the patrol, which led to today's disaster. In addition, there are other legal issues, which will not be detailed here. (3) Regarding refuting Japan's attack, for example, the answer to the 53 outstanding cases claimed by Japan, the clarification of the anti-foreign remarks in our country's textbooks pointed out by Japan, the explanation of the Fengpiao issue, the explanation of the boycott of Japanese goods issue, and the claim made by Japan that the development of the Eastern Province is entirely due to Japan's efforts, it lists the facts of China's construction achievements in the Eastern Province to prove the unreliability of Japan's statement. All such issues are included. Mr. Jin also said that in addition to the various documents that have been submitted, there are still some that have not been submitted, and they are being rushed to prepare. In addition, the problems raised by the commissioners of the investigation team are also quite a few. The commissioners of our side also study and reply to this problem in order, or hold meetings with the commissioners of the group from time to time to discuss. As for the return to Ping of the investigation team, the committees will also hold meetings with our country's representatives from time to time to discuss various issues. In general, the work of our country's representative office can only be concluded after the investigation team's report is completed. However, for the sake of saving time at that time, these twenty or thirty kinds of statements of argument were drafted in Western languages, and all of them must be translated into Chinese. In addition, in addition to reporting to the government at any time, the representative office must also submit a general report. This kind of work also takes a lot of time, and it will take about two months to complete.</p>

Since the Shenhu Incident occurred, due to the rising popular sentiment in various places, obstacles have arisen. In order to understand the situation of popular sentiment in various parts of China, the Japanese government specially dispatched Tashiro to China to inquire in detail during the consuls' meeting.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Dike Construction Association Resolves Yesterday to Advance Funds for Urgent Projects <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangnan Dike Construction Relief Committee, in addition to the dike construction projects that have already been started, still has more than 1,500 zhang of projects that must be continued, which require about 700,000 yuan. It has repeatedly appealed to the central government, but has not received a reply. At the standing committee meeting of the association yesterday, Vice Chairman Mu Ou-chu proposed a discussion, and everyone agreed to choose the most urgent 170 zhang, which requires about 80,000 yuan, and advance the funds for construction. It is estimated that more than 120 zhang belong to Chenhua Creek in Baoshan, and 50 zhang belong to the Military Parade Platform in Taicang. Work has started separately this morning. The cement project built by the former port authority in the Gaoqiao area was poorly designed and the foundation moved. The Dike Construction Association also decided to ask Zhang Xiaoliang and Jin Danyi to conduct a detailed survey tomorrow before deciding on a solution.</p>

<p>Demand Revision of Rent Reduction and Exemption Measures</p>
<p>Since the Songhu War, citizens have suffered great losses. Although the war has subsided, the wounds remain. Therefore, tenants have had a rent reduction and exemption movement with landlords. The Municipal Government had previously promulgated standards for rent reduction and exemption, but the Municipal United Congress believed that the rent reduction measures promulgated by the Municipal Government were unfair and once opposed them, requesting the Municipal Government to reissue them. The Municipal Government then stated that this standard measure had already been promulgated and had been instructed by the Executive Yuan to be feasible and could not be reversed. It was decided that representatives Wu Jian-e and Zhang Yi-qing would go to Beijing this afternoon to petition the Executive Yuan. If the goal is not achieved, they are determined to continue.</p>

<h3 id="e146">Female Communist Suspects Escorted to Guangdong <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Ou Meng-jue and Mo Qiong Endure Further Hardship</p>
<p>According to the Guomin News Agency, Ou Meng-jue (i.e., Zhou Ai-xia), a woman from Guangdong who previously joined the Communist Party and worked in Guangzhou, is 27 years old and graduated from Guangdong Kunwei Middle School in the 15th year of the Republic [1926], serving as a professor at Lingdong Middle School. Her husband, Deng Li-wen, is currently doing business in Japan. Ou's friend, Mo Qiong (i.e., Liu Zhen), from Guangxi, is 28 years old and graduated from Guilin Mingde Primary School in the 16th year of the Republic [1927], and is the wife of Su Feng, a teacher at Jinan University. Due to the separation caused by the Shanghai War, she went to work in a shirt factory in Hong Kong's Zhongshan line. Ou and Mo lived together and became friends in Guangdong. Due to suspicion of being communists, they were detained by the Guangzhou government for a month. After investigation and finding no evidence, they were ordered to be deported. Therefore, Ou and Mo boarded the Changxing Company's Asian Queen ship from Hong Kong on the 15th of this month and set off for Shanghai. However, He Luo, a detective from the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, discovered this and sent special detectives Zheng Bo and Lu Biao to track them to Shanghai and telegraphed the Shanghai Public Security Bureau for assistance. Director Wen immediately dispatched officers to arrest Ou and Mo when the ship arrived at the port and brought them to the bureau. The Third Section interrogated them. According to Ou's confession, she had previously joined the Communist Party and worked in Guangdong, but she has now left. This time, she was ordered to leave the country by the Guangdong authorities. Mo denied being a communist. The Municipal Public Security Bureau, because the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau had sent personnel to escort them, should be allowed to hand them over to the arriving personnel for questioning. It is reported that the two detectives, Zheng and Lu, escorted the two suspects, Ou and Mo, to Guangzhou at 4 AM yesterday (the 23rd).</p>
<h3 id="e147">Dispute Over Revised Road Excavation Rules by the Municipal Bureau of Public Works <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>The road excavation rules for citizens in this city who excavate roads and repair road surfaces due to construction projects were promulgated by the Municipal Bureau of Public Works in the 17th year of the Republic [1928]. Later, various public utility companies, because the fees were too high, submitted a report to the Municipal Government for approval to reduce them. For several years, it was convenient. Recently, Xue Ci-xin, the section chief of the Second Section of the Bureau of Public Works, re-revised the original rules. The repair fee for excavating road surfaces is about doubled compared to the original, almost equal to the road excavation repair fee in the concessions. The procedures for obtaining permits have also become more complicated. In particular, it takes at least 20 days to issue a permit after applying, and the method of applying for permits for emergency engineering changes is considered the most inconvenient by various companies. Moreover, these rules were only promulgated on the 11th and must be implemented on the 16th, leaving no time for all parties involved to consider, which is very obstructive. Therefore, various companies convened a meeting and elected representatives on the 15th to meet with Section Chief Xue to request that the opinions of all parties be accommodated and that the implementation be postponed. Section Chief Xue also approved at that time and instructed the companies to formally submit a report. The companies have done so. Yesterday, the representatives went to negotiate again. Unexpectedly, Section Chief Xue expressed a firm refusal to postpone the implementation, saying that the Bureau of Public Works could forward the companies' statements to the Municipal Government for review within two days, but the Municipal Government's reply would take a month, which would be too long and difficult to postpone, and unilaterally notified the Public Utilities Bureau that it must implement the newly promulgated rules from the 16th of this month, otherwise, permits would not be issued. Therefore, recently, various electrical companies, water companies, and tram companies in the city have been returning applications for road excavation for planting poles, installing pipes, connecting water, and other projects that require the use of roads through the Public Utilities Bureau and refusing to approve them. As a result, various companies cannot start work without a permit, and all users' requests for connecting electricity and water are completely suspended. The companies believe that the central government's promulgation of laws and regulations should still give the people a long period of hesitation so that they have the opportunity to consider and state their opinions. Now, after the city has suffered a terrible war and all industries are declining, Section Chief Xue suddenly revised the new regulations, increasing the burden on the people, taking directly from the companies and indirectly from the users, and suddenly promulgated them within a short period of time, forcing compliance by not issuing permits, and not accepting consultation, which is not the policy that should be taken in the loudly sung reconstruction plan. It is reported that they have united to notify all users of the above situation and requested the Municipal Government to provide relief, and continue to handle matters in accordance with the old regulations until the new regulations are revised to avoid stagnation. I don't know if our municipal party and government bureaus can consider the suffering of the people after the war and immediately make a decision to resolve the dispute.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Jih Sheng Association Obtains Disaster Report from Huoqiu <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Jih Sheng Association recently received a letter from Mai Yi-sheng, Chen Kao-hou, Mai Xiao-zhai, Pan Bing-qing, Tang Feng-lou, and other representatives of the refugees from the Guanyue Temple and the Great King Temple in Huoqiu, leading more than 1,100 refugees, stating that the refugees belong to Huoqiu and all have modest family property, live in peace, and are reunited with their families. Unfortunately, disaster has frequently descended from the sky. The Communist bandits ravaged the front, and the flood continued to ruin the rear. The deprivation of life and the loss of property cannot be counted. The survivors left their homes and fled their hometowns. Bengbu is the gateway to the south of the Li River and a land of happiness. There are more than 10,000 people, but they cannot afford to rent houses and are most distressed. More than 1,000 people live in dilapidated temples. If there is no roof, they are covered in mud and rain. They sleep on the ground, and the dampness seeps into their skin. They also suffer from hunger and starvation, which is overwhelming. Therefore, since the chaos, countless people have died and become ghosts in foreign lands, regretting it in the afterlife. This is the first thing that can be heartbreaking and cried for. Mothers and children, husbands and wives, are forced by hunger and cold and willingly induced to disappear. In total, dozens and hundreds of people are separated, grieving at separation and grieving at death. This is the second thing that can be heartbreaking and cried for. Etiquette is emphasized, and veils are important. However, to endure hunger, they have no time to take care of themselves. Young women beg from door to door, with no dignity, and all sense of shame is lost. This is the third thing that can be heartbreaking and cried for. Spoiled children and weak women are loved unusually. They get sick for no reason, and they look at each other like Qin and Yue [distant relatives]. How can they really bear it, but their strength is weak. Once they are gone forever, they are sad forever. This is the fourth thing that can be heartbreaking and cried for. This time, your association publicly recommended Mr. Wang Du-sheng and Mr. Zhang Ze-pu to come to Bengbu in the name of the White Cross Society to set up two refugee shelters to comfort the refugees. Seeing the difficulties and hardships, temporary donations can't solve the problem. I hope to save people and save the (bear to give birth, out of the water and to the mattress, is to rely on your association, etc. The association's heart for disaster relief is long, and the fundraising has become exhausted. The people of benevolence and virtue in the world should respond to this great disaster and make a wish to bring blessings. This is the time.</p>

<p>An Englishman, William, rented room 625 on the sixth floor of the YMCA on Jing'an Temple Road. At around 2 AM yesterday, he returned from outside. About an hour later, he suddenly used his own pistol to shoot himself in the temple and was rushed to Baolong Hospital for treatment but died at the hospital at 11 AM yesterday.

<p>Chen Mao-zou, a resident of 16 Nansheng Lane, Yunzaobang, Wusong, is a farmer. His son, Gou-lang, is 22 years old this year. Since he was a child, Shen Hong-jiang, a fellow villager, acted as a matchmaker and betrothed Shen Lin-jiang's daughter, Lan-qing (20 years old), to him. At that time, he paid a betrothal gift of 12 yuan and a tea ceremony of 4 yuan, and there was also a red invitation. Later, the man grew up and the woman grew up, and he should have been married, but Mao-lang was financially strapped and unable to complete the marriage for his son. Unexpectedly, Shen Lin-jiang, because the Chen surname was delayed in coming to marry, suddenly remarried his daughter Lan-qing to Zhang Zhang-sheng (24 years old), who opened a cigarette and paper shop on Xiaoshadu Road in Shanghai, last December. Chen Mao-lang found out about this at the time, but Shen Lin-jiang's address was unknown at the time, so he could not go to negotiate. Recently, it was discovered that Zhang Zhang-sheng lived at 106 Xiaoshadu Road. On the 14th of this month, he hired a car, took Gou-lang with him, and secretly went to 106 Xiaoshadu Road. It happened that Zhang was not at home. Mao-lang and Gou-lang then went into the inner room, put Lan-qing in the car, and drove back to Wusong. They married Gou-lang at that time. When Zhang Zhang-sheng returned home, he did not see Lan-qing. After being informed by neighbors, he had been kidnapped and taken away. He searched everywhere for Lan-qing's whereabouts and learned that it was done by Mao-lang and Gou-lang and that they now live in Wusong. He went to Wusong yesterday to negotiate with Chen Mao-lang. The two sides had a big quarrel and filed a complaint with the First Precinct of the Seventh District Public Security Bureau. After Director Yang clarified the situation, he believed that the case involved marriage disputes between a woman and two men, and that the two sides had different statements. He prepared a document and submitted it to the General Bureau for investigation.</p>

<p>At about 9 AM yesterday, the No. 11 ferry, which runs between the Xinguang Wharf on the Puxi side and the Chunjiang Wharf on the Pudong side, was carrying passengers back to Pudong from the Puxi Wharf. Unexpectedly, just as it reached the center of the river, a middle-aged man among the passengers, for unknown reasons, took advantage of people's inattention and jumped into the river to commit suicide. Because the water was very fast, the man's body disappeared in an instant. Lu Fu-bao, the old ferryman, was unable to rescue him and reported the circumstances of the deceased's suicide to the Customs Water Police Station before leaving. It is reported that the man was wearing a white long gown, was about 30 years old, and other details are unknown.</p>

Today we came here, and the tombstones are like a forest, with each friend and relative paying tribute. However, we have more than just a feeling of life and death for Mr. Yulu. Everyone dies, and Mr. Yulu died young and promising, dying unnaturally, like a precious sword suddenly breaking when trying its edge, like a fine brush suddenly breaking when writing. We who are left behind can only work hard to complete the unfinished ambitions of the dead, and then we can face the dead.</p>

<p>At about 9 PM the night before last, a Western policeman from the No. 48 Shu Pu patrol station was passing by the intersection of Qianglin Road and Taopeng Road when an unknown person reported that a person had been shot in the Yixiang Lane in that area and was lying in a pool of blood. The policeman immediately went to inspect and reported the incident to the Yulin Road patrol station by phone, instructing the detectives to investigate. After an investigation, the injured person was taken to Tongren Hospital but died after unsuccessful treatment. Later, the patrol station found out that the deceased was from Nanjing and his name was Liu Fa-xian, also known as Xiao Liu. He had committed several robbery cases and was being pursued by the patrol station. Li Chun-gui, an accomplice who had been arrested, was brought out of prison and confirmed that it was the deceased's body. The body was taken to the Feilun Road Mortuary. Yesterday morning, a report was made to the First Special District Court, and Prosecutor Guo Wei, along with forensic doctor Zhang Yan and clerk Wang Zuyi, went to the mortuary to inspect the body. Liu Bao-sheng, the younger brother of the deceased, claimed that he was a blacksmith and lived in the shop. He did not know that his brother had been shot until someone told him. He requested permission to claim the body. Li Chun-gui, the deceased's accomplice, testified. Guo Jun then ruled that the deceased Liu Fa-xian had indeed been shot in the head and died, and a bullet should be taken out immediately and temporarily handed over to the patrol station to be sent to the gun shop for inspection. The body was handed over to the deceased's younger brother, Liu Bao-sheng, for burial. The murderer is being investigated by the patrol station, and the case will be handled after the arrest.</p>

<p>Wan Chang Cigarette and Paper Shop, located at No. 810 Limalu, Dongjiadu, Nanshi, is owned by Chen Pengyun from Zhejiang. At about 2 AM yesterday, the shop caught fire due to carelessness. The fire quickly spread through the roof. All district fire brigades were notified, drove to the scene, and connected water to extinguish the fire. At that time, the southeast wind was strong, and in an instant, the fire spread to the neighboring Jude Pawnshop. After an hour, the fire was extinguished. In this fire, in addition to the destruction of the two-story building of the Wan Chang Cigarette and Paper Shop, one building of the Jude Pawnshop was also completely destroyed. All the belongings and assets of each household were lost, amounting to about 40,000 yuan. The upper pavilion of the Hulongsheng Tea Shop next door was also affected. When the fire was raging, Zhang Lide, the guard police officer from the 10th post, rushed over and brought Xu Zhaoqian, a Ningbo man and employee of the Wan Chang Cigarette and Paper Shop, to the First Precinct of the district. Under the preliminary interrogation by the director, because the cause of the fire at Wan Chang this time was unknown, and there was a fire insurance policy of 3,000 taels, and the shop owner Chen Pengyun avoided being arrested after the fire, there were many doubts. The police were dispatched to conduct a detailed investigation before further action.</p>

<p>Wu Yong-sheng's Clever Transportation Exposed</p>
<p>At about 11 AM yesterday, police officers from the Second Division of the Municipal Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol Team were patrolling the river to the Zhengchang Wharf and saw the Xin Yong'an steamship. They immediately boarded the ship for inspection and saw a passenger carrying a wicker basket in the cabin. The police officers stepped forward to search and saw a ham. They took it out and used an iron pick to pierce the bulrush bag wrapped around the leg, feeling a hard object obstructing it. They removed the bulrush bag and saw a layer of lead skin wrapped around the leg. They were highly suspicious of why the ham was wrapped in lead skin and opened the lead skin, discovering that the ham only had one foot claw exposed, and the lead skin contained a large number of red pills, a total of nine cloth bags, about 9,000 pills. They arrested the person and transferred him to the Nanshi General Team along with the evidence. During the preliminary interrogation by General Team Leader Wang Qin-tang, the person claimed to be Wu Yong-sheng, 33 years old, from Jiangxi. His other words were ambiguous. Because the matter involved smuggling contraband, he was ordered to prepare a document and send it to the bureau for interrogation.</p>

The family of the deceased filed a lawsuit, and Yang Xialing was released on bail pending investigation. The family of the deceased has hired a lawyer to sue the Defense Corps for murder, claiming that the deceased did not go to Pudong to plot illegal activities but was deliberately killed by members of the corps, and they are requesting justice. Therefore, Prosecutor Yang again ordered the police to summon the original suspect and related witnesses for questioning yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Detention and Investigation of Illegal Sale of Saltpeter and Sulfur <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Shangbao and Special Zone Saltpeter and Sulfur Bureau of the Ministry of Military Affairs recently learned that Dingyu Seafood Store at No. 38 Yangxing Street, outside Xiaodongmen in the French Concession, was privately storing and secretly selling sulfur, violating the ban. Therefore, Bureau Chief Chen Peng and Deputy Bureau Chief Shen Sixun prepared a document and, on the afternoon of the previous day, sent Yang Yucheng, chief of the business section of the bureau, to report to the French Concession police station, requesting assistance in the search. The head detective approved the request and dispatched Detective Jin Mingxiang to go to the address together. They found four pounds of sulfur and detained Chen Shumei, the accountant of the store, and took him to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. Gu Shouxi, the police station's lawyer, explained the case, stating that according to the report from the Saltpeter and Sulfur Bureau, they had searched the store with the police's assistance and found four pounds of sulfur. They are now prosecuting according to Article 201 of the Criminal Law for endangering public safety. Yang Yucheng, the bureau's representative, also recounted the previous situation and requested an investigation. During the interrogation, Chen Shumei confessed that the sulfur was brought to him by someone in February of last year, before the ban, to be sold and bought for bleaching white fungus. He claimed that he did not sell it privately and that his colleagues in the store could testify to this. Judge Xiong reviewed the confession and ordered that the case be adjourned for further interrogation. The defendant was released on bail, requiring two neighboring shops to guarantee his appearance when summoned. If no guarantee was provided, he would be detained.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Dr. Wu Lianzhou Discusses Damp-Heat Syndrome <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Dr. Wu Lianzhou spoke in detail yesterday about the death of Shen Xuejun. Dr. Wu said that Shen Xuejun held an important position as a supervisor in the Export Department of the Jianghai Customs and was in his prime. It is a great pity that he died recently from damp-heat syndrome. Colleagues and friends in the customs all expressed their regret. Even though Dr. Wu had no prior acquaintance with Mr. Shen, he was invited to provide a diagnosis when Mr. Shen was critically ill, but there was nothing he could do, and he felt deep regret. The damp-heat syndrome this summer is different from in the past. In recent days, the weather has been extremely hot, and the epidemic is particularly severe. Patients initially have a slight fever, but after three or four days, the fever increases sharply. A reddish-purple rash appears on the chest, neck, and arms, called "banzhen" (maculopapular rash), which requires careful attention. Families often mistake it for prickly heat in the summer, and Chinese medicine practitioners also believe that it is not yet the time for the rash to appear. Western doctors are even more unaware of its nature and do not pay much attention to it. The rash appears as cloud-like patches with no clear borders, while the papules are bright red and fine dots, and prickly heat is subtly raised and feels prickly to the touch. Experts can easily distinguish between them. Moreover, the eruption of a rash in damp-heat syndrome, including white nodules, is a way for the pathogenic heat to escape, providing an opportunity for the fever to gradually subside. In the early stages, it is best to use acrid and cool methods to release the pathogen, and when the rash fully appears, sweet and bland methods should be used to clear the ying (nutritive) level. If mistreated with drying and heat-inducing substances that injure the fluids, or if attacked with purging methods that cause the pathogen to sink deeper, or if the rash does not fully erupt, or if it subsides too early or does not subside at all, it can lead to death. Patients often lack this kind of common knowledge, which often leads to major mistakes. Doctors should be able to recognize the rash early on to avoid leading people down the wrong path. The disease progresses rapidly, and life may not be guaranteed from morning to night.</p>

<h3 id="e175">Random Thoughts on "Ge'er" <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>Suddenly, a strange and eccentric term sweeps across the tongues of the youth – "Ge'er."</p>
<p>The pronunciation of "Ge" is close to "Wuo," somewhere between "Wang" and "Wuo," a bit heavier than "Wang," a bit lighter than "Wuo," that is the "Ge" in "Ge'er" on the youth's lips.</p>
<p>The origin of "Ge'er" probably lies in Shanghai. With the convenience of railway transport, the youth of schools along the Shanghai-Hangzhou and Beijing-Shanghai lines likely all speak "Ge'er." There is no definitive interpretation of "Ge'er." Some say it is a loanword, a transliteration of the Western "Wile," meaning cunning. However, in the mouths of the students, "Ge'er" does not exclusively mean cunning. Anything special, tactical, or capable can be described with "Ge'er." Now it spreads further and further, no longer limited to young students. In the mouths of all kinds of playboys, it is often "Ge'er" this, "Ge'er" that. Out of ten sentences, at least three or four are dominated by "Ge'er." Then "Ge'er" almost becomes a kind of slang.</p>
<p>In the past, everyone spoke of "Fa Xue" (bloody) this and "Fa Xue" that. Now, everyone speaks of "Ge'er" this and "Ge'er" that. The "Fa Xue" of the past became an ominous harbinger of the Northeast bloody battles and the Shanghai bloody battles. Today's "Ge'er," I fear, is also not a good omen. Since the September 18th Incident and the January 28th Incident, China's stagnation has reached its peak. At this time, still loudly shouting "Ge'er Ge'er" is truly stagnant! Truly bleak!</p>
<p>The proper terms set by the government, such as calling Nanjing the capital and Beijing Beiping, but in the mouths of some, it is still Nanjing and Beijing, never changing. Only this inexplicable "Ge'er," I don't know what magical power it possesses, is able to pass unimpeded, sweeping across the tongues of the youth! Amazing! Amazing!</p>
<h3 id="e176">Record of the Battle of the Datong River by Ma Zhongwu <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Quchang</p>
<p>Ma Zhongwu Jinyu and Kun were famous generals of recent times. In the war of 1894-95, he fought in the areas of Tianzhuangtai, Taiping Mountain, and Ganlizhai. With only a thousand soldiers, he resisted tens of thousands of enemy troops, bravely supporting himself, and was ultimately able to preserve his forces. The Battle of the Datong River (in Pyongyang, Korea) was especially notable. When Zhongwu received the order to garrison the Datong, the enemy initially came with light cavalry. He once defeated them in battle. Subsequently, enemy reinforcements swarmed in, exceeding twenty thousand, causing great shock to our army. Yet the Duke still acted calmly as usual. He said to the guerrilla commander, "If you fight with a thousand men, better to die than return to cook for your mother. Only if you are in urgent need of help, report it to me." The Duke asked, "How many deaths are acceptable?" The guerrilla commander said, "Perhaps two hundred." The Duke became angry and said, "Wait until five hundred before you report." The guerrilla commander then had half of his men lie in ambush in the ditch as the left flank and half in the forest as the right flank, supporting each other. They fought for five hours. The enemy artillery arrived and concentrated its fire on the forest. The shells hit the trees, making sounds like mountains cracking. The trees were all broken. The Duke, judging that the attack had subsided, quickly led the entire army to take advantage of the situation. At this time, the soldiers had been accumulating anger for a long time, and their momentum was like wind and rain. Their shouts shook the heavens and the earth. The enemy was caught off guard and suffered a great defeat, with thousands of corpses. The river water turned entirely red. In this battle, the enemy lost their courage and retreated dozens of miles. The Duke was about to pursue the fleeing enemy, but the commanding general, Wei Rugui, had already fled. The road home was cut off by the enemy. The Duke was enraged, clenching his hair and brandishing his sword, personally charging into the enemy formation. He broke through the enemy ranks and escaped the encirclement, bringing his troops home intact. At the same time, Nie Huancheng also dared to fight, depriving the enemy of their spirit, but the commander Song Qing, a cunning official, overshadowed the two men. He was cowardly and jealous of their achievements, and secretly held them back. The Duke sighed and said, "If I could have worked together with Gongting and not been restrained by Zhu San, we would have been able to pacify the enemy." Gongting was the courtesy name of Zhongjie, and Zhu San was the courtesy name of Song Qing. When the peace treaty was concluded, the Duke cried loudly to the sky and refused to eat for several days. The entire army was moved and wept. Later, in the Gengzi Year (1900) Boxer Rebellion, he also repeatedly achieved military exploits. The enemy gave him the posthumous name "Fierce Horse." Today, General Ma of Longjiang is also known for his loyalty and courage. Their brilliance illuminates the past and the present. Is he also rising up, having heard of his family's traditions?</p>
<h3 id="e177">West Lake's Illness <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Shancha</p>
<p>West Lake, with its colorfully picturesque scenery, provides material for painters. Its lingering temple bells, gentle breezes, and many sounds and colors provide inspiration for poets. Its pleasant climate and fresh air make the sick healthy. Its clear flowing waves and quiet paths allow passionate girls to forget themselves. Its peaceful spaces and fragrant courtyards allow young couples to spend their honeymoons in ease. Its countless temples and monasteries keep Buddhist grandmothers busy with their yellow cloth bags. Its long dikes and lonely mountain roads allow frustrated politicians and poor young men to wander. And there are many, many more things that allow archaeologists, botanists, geologists, and all kinds of "ists" and "ers" to pick up their microscopes or rack their brains. In short, West Lake is suitable for everyone's needs, and whoever has not visited West Lake will be considered by others to have a great regret. Therefore, people like McCloy (a member of the League of Nations investigation team), who come to China in a hurry and have a major mission, cannot help but steal a moment to visit West Lake, calling it a "pass-by" tour. From this, you can know how much charm West Lake possesses? But, but there is an iron-like law in the universe: "extreme prosperity is followed by decline," and there is "a beautiful woman buried in yellow earth" for both the ancients and the moderns to lament. West Lake cannot be lucky enough to be an exception. Thus, after the brilliant golden age has passed, it has inevitably stepped onto the sad and tragic prelude. And now, and now, she has contracted an incurable chronic disease.</p>
<p>In recent days, in the clear mornings when the little birds sing, the lake and mountains open their tired and sleepy eyes. If you want to get up early and enjoy West Lake's morning makeup, then you will be greatly disappointed. Because whether you run to "Su Causeway in Spring Dawn" or "Echoes in the Quiet Valley", you will surely hear the rough military songs spreading. Even if the mountains are all covered in beautiful sunlight and the lake shines with a sweet and tranquil smile, you cannot help but feel that in the tranquil and serene embrace of West Lake, there is an extremely incongruous tune.</p>
<p>Since the Su and Bai Causeways have changed the small paths with overgrown rocks and weeds into fire-snake-like roads, although the female historians wearing high heels have gained a lot of convenience, the beast-like cars are rampaging on them as if they have gone mad. The solid tires burst out annoying sounds on the ground, followed by rolling up ten thousand feet of yellow dust. When the girls walk by slowly, they will have much more trouble, when they unintentionally get the alert from behind! That loud strange cry will make them carefully avoid stepping aside. When that beast-like thing runs past them like the wind, they can't help but sway their willow waists, hold their small handkerchiefs to their powdered noses, and it is urgent. Good, the smell of gasoline holding the circles in the quiet space takes away the intoxicating fragrance of flowers, and the roaring replaces the crisp chirping of birds in those years. Although this is the so-called application of material civilization, how can our virgin-like West Lake bear it? Therefore, she has listlessly lost weight and faded in color. Even before the lotus leaves have revealed their fragrance, you will hear the lament of autumn insects at the bottom of Geling, and the ringing of the bells that cling to people's heels, it is as if the Diridan-Bell will bury West Lake. This is already enough for West Lake to suffer. What's more, robberies have occurred repeatedly, and the tea-picking girls in Longjing and the Buddhist grandmothers in Huanglong Cave have all suffered robberies. Thus, West Lake has become a dangerous place, and our brothers are guarding it in the shade of the willows and on the dikes. Needless to say, the sword light and the lake light are mixed together. In this way, it will obviously cut off West Lake's weak life.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Twenty-Five Fiancées <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Shadow-Dumb</p>
<p>Recently, in the region of Gürglen, a young man was discovered who, over the past five years, had successively engaged twenty-five young women. Thus, he had a total of twenty-five fiancées. However, he has now been sent to prison for the crime of defrauding all his fiancées of their money and clothing. Every time he became engaged to a young woman, he would say that after the marriage, he would repay the money and clothing he owed. When he was sent to prison this time, he said to people, "(This is a very worthwhile thing; I have defrauded so many fiancées.)" On the day the court opened, twenty of the deceived young women came to court. Many of the women said to him that if he could fulfill the marriage promise, they would not prosecute. But he resolutely said, "(No, I am going to prison immediately.)"</p>
<h3 id="e179">A Love Affair of Tears and Laughter <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Juemin</p>
<p>A friend came from my hometown to tell me about a strange romance of an anti-Japanese hero during the height of the Shanghai battle. The story is particularly charming, and I write it down below to add to conversation.</p>
<p>Outside the North Gate of my county is the Ning-Shao Guild Hall. The guild hall has an attached side building. Every year during the Qingming Festival, family members bring wine and offerings to mourn the newly deceased. A girl, nicknamed Juan, had just lost her mother and the coffin was temporarily placed in the building. She also went to mourn during the Qingming Festival. Coincidentally, a certain military officer passed by the area and entered to look around. He heard a very sad crying sound. Following the sound, he went to look and was astonished by her beauty, like a goddess. He could not help but stop and listen. After a while, the girl still cried sadly. The military officer could not restrain himself and helped her up, advising her to stop crying. The girl thought it was an insult and was about to scold him, but the military officer continued with extremely gentle words of comfort. The girl saw that he was simple and endearing and unintentionally smiled. She quickly covered her mouth and left. The military officer was lost in thought for a long time, as if he had lost something. Later, he inquired with the people in the building and learned that the girl's family was in decline and lacked the funds to bury her mother. Therefore, she had no choice but to temporarily place the coffin in the building. He urgently returned to the military headquarters and ordered a guard to send five hundred gold coins to the girl's family, saying that he knew the girl's family was suffering from a lack of funds to bury her mother. These five hundred gold coins were a small token of his sincerity. The girl had an older brother who was initially very shocked. He then learned the story from the girl and expressed extreme dissatisfaction. He believed that the gift of gold must have ulterior motives and wanted to refuse it. However, he was also afraid of the other party's armed status. As he was hesitating, the girl insisted that it could not be refused. In the end, he had no choice but to accept it. Before long, the matchmaker of the military officer arrived, expressing the officer's admiration for the girl and his desire to marry her to manage his household. The girl's brother was originally a merchant and was at a loss, not knowing how to respond. He urgently discussed it with the girl and blamed her for insisting on accepting the gift of gold, which led to today's changes. At first, the girl blushed and lowered her head without saying a word. Then, she resolutely expressed her willingness to follow the military officer and even threatened to die for it. The girl's brother, seeing that her determination could not be changed, had no choice but to agree. Thus, this charming and amusing love affair spread throughout the county until today.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Worth Introducing National Goods Factories (8) <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— He Gongxing</p>
<p>(Thirteen) Plaster Model Factory</p>
<p>Plaster models are decorations for desks or walls. Those who draw use them for sketching or as specimen models. The sales volume is very large. Rome, Greece, France, and other countries produce exquisite goods, lifelike. Japanese goods are also imported, but the work is rough and far inferior to Western goods. However, because they are cheap, they can still be sold in our country. In the tenth year of the Republic of China, Qi Guanshan of Shanghai returned from Japan. Using what he had learned in Japan, he established the Plaster Art and Craft Factory in Daji Road, West Gate of Shanghai. He reproduced various character portraits and the business was quite good. Although it was a small-capital craft, it was also appreciated by contemporary artists.</p>
<p>Following the Art Factory, there were two others, the Mei-Yi and Zhonghua, both founded by graduates of art schools. To date, there are three in the entire city of Shanghai. Mei-Yi is on Caishi Road, and Zhonghua is on Avenue Albert.</p>
<p>Gypsum is produced in Sichuan, Hubei, and other provinces in our country. The market price is more than four yuan per dan. Shanghai Labor Seng Road's Rui Tai Stone Powder Factory and Xiaodu Road's Shunchang Stone Powder Factory specialize in mechanically producing various white stone powders, including gypsum powder, which is also sold. The value is about nine yuan per dan. Although stone powder is more than twice as expensive as gypsum, using stone powder can save a grinding process.</p>
<p>Manufacturing plaster models is entirely a manual industry, but it uses molds. The size of the capital depends on the number of molds in the factory. Even as little as one or two hundred yuan can be used to start a business.</p>
<p>Each character model must be a combination of multiple molds; otherwise, after the plaster powder is in the mold, it will not be easy to remove. However, simple ones may only have one mold. Character portraits with curves are often added separately; otherwise, they cannot be complete.</p>
<p>For example, to reproduce portraits of great men, first sculpt the shape with clay, then make a mold, and then turn the plaster statue. As long as the mold is not broken, plaster statues can be made every day.</p>
<p>The manufacturing method is to mix gypsum powder with suitable water and put it into the mold. Wait until it is slightly dry, take it out, and decorate it. As for the sculpting craft, it is impossible without specialized training.</p>
<p>(Fourteen) Elastic Bands</p>
<p>Elastic bands have always been Japanese goods. In the ninth year of the Republic of China, Hong Yu Band Factory in Tiantong An Road, Zhabei, was the first Chinese manufacturer of elastic bands. However, it closed down soon after. Currently, there are eight manufacturers of elastic bands in Shanghai: De Long, on Ma Huo Road; Xin Shi, on South Chengdu Road; Hui Chang, on Yangshupu Road; Changcheng, on Zhoushan Road; Mei De, on Nanyang Bridge; Lin Yin, on Lin Yin Road; Hong Long, on Hai Chao Temple Road; and Jingmei, on Hui Ning Road. De Long is the largest, and its output is also greater.</p>
<p>The biggest use of elastic bands is for making sock garters and suspenders, divided into cotton and silk. Most of the ones commonly used on the market are woven with 80-count mercerized thread, rayon, and rubber bands. The narrowest are only three cents wide, and the widest are one inch and four cents wide. Narrow bands are mostly woven with iron hand looms, while wide bands are mostly woven with wooden flat looms. There are many colors, and the width varies, so the price is very uneven. Each board has twelve yards. In addition to the products of the eight Shanghai factories being sold well in various ports, the elastic bands produced by Suzhou Meilun Factory are also sold in Shanghai because they are cheap and good, and especially welcomed by Shanghai people. Unfortunately, the raw materials are all foreign goods, and rubber bands must be Japanese goods.</p>

<p>— Bu Chu Ting Cao Zhai Fu</p>

<p>I said, "(The reason why the old temple was able to mobilize the entire village as soldiers is mostly because Battalion Commander Jiang was willing to go to the countryside to fulfill his obligations. If this were promoted throughout the country, how many retired military officers would be willing to serve as instructors?" Mr. Zhu said, "(Now the country has more than two million troops. Using the existing troops to train the local people for self-defense is extremely simple. The responsibility of the army is not only to protect the country and defend the people but also to train the people to protect their own villages and their own country. If the troops in various places take on this responsibility, then the instructors are readily available, the trainees are readily available, and the firearms are readily available. It won't take long to build the Republic of China into a steel-cast country that no one can destroy. The biggest difficulty now is that everyone does not understand their own responsibilities. As long as the people recognize that protecting the country and villages is their own responsibility, and the troops in various places also recognize that training the people for self-defense is their duty, everything else will be easy.)"</p>

<p>I asked again, "(Now that the country has reached a critical juncture of life and death, what other training should the Chinese nation receive besides military training to be able to revive, turn danger into safety?" Mr. Zhu said, ")Education is racing against the national crisis. In my opinion, the Chinese nation should receive six major trainings together to overcome the difficulties. These six major trainings are:</p>
<p>First, universal military training, so that everyone becomes a healthy son of the country. Second, universal production training, so that everyone becomes a wealth-creating worker. Third, universal scientific training, so that everyone can use their minds in their labor. Fourth, universal literacy training, so that everyone can obtain symbols for conveying thoughts. Fifth, universal civil rights training, so that everyone becomes the master of the Republic of China. Sixth, universal fertility training, so that everyone can have fewer and better births when they reach reproductive age to recreate a better future and a better nation.)"</p>

<p>Yesterday, the silver market suddenly reported a drop, but the forward market rose instead, and the exchange rate continued to be small. As for the HSBC listing, except for the French franc falling by one yuan and the German exchange rate falling by two or five, the rest, such as British and American, remained unchanged. It was almost internally slightly different. After the initial level, it was loose. As a result, compared with the previous night, British gold was up by zero six two five, and U.S. dollars were reduced by zero six two five. In fact, it was the reason for the small exchange rate squeeze, and the gold price was first strong and then weak, and then fell back to two taels. With zero, people's hearts are flustered. I heard that the United States will implement paper money to help the unemployed, and the silver market may turn up. The transaction volume of each bank is still not deserted, and tens of thousands of pounds have been traded in British gold. The silver company bought in early. There were also many counter-transactions between the banks, but few Chinese merchants had inflows and outflows. Up to a total of four or five hundred thousand yuan in U.S. dollars, Chen Fengyong Shou Fengyong and others still sold out in order to redeem gold. Silver companies also absorbed September, and the market will close after noon on Saturday due to the weekend.</p>
<p>The British Exchange In-Market Market only rose and fell by zero six two five between morning and noon. The selling price at the beginning was one shilling eight pence zero six two five to one eighty seven five, and the buying price was one two five to two five.

<p>The weekend financial market was deserted. Because it was Saturday yesterday, banks did not do business in the afternoon as usual. As a result, the situation in the afternoon suddenly became quiet, especially since there was simply no major news in the market worth recording, and all market prices were the same as in the morning, and transactions were particularly simple. The market conditions are described as follows:</p>
<p>Percentage Points, Early and Midday Were Consistent at the Same Price (One Foreign Penny): The price of foreign pennies in the morning and midday markets was the same as six qian nine fen one li seven hao half, a sudden increase of seven hao half compared to the midday market the previous day, but it seemed that it was still half a li stronger than the 21st, (Silver Demolition) The morning market turned to be three fen higher than the previous day, calculated as one qian five fen, and the situation was slightly firmer. The midday market was still the same price, and the head added water was about one qian, the same as the previous day. The bank's listing increased by one fen, calculated as six fen</p>
<p>The Corner Ocean Was Calm: Copper Coins Increased Again. Because no one traded in the South of the Yangtze River small ocean markets in the morning and midday, the results were that no one cared about the markets from beginning to end, and the market prices were maintained as six qian zero three li, and the Guangdong small ocean market was five qian eight fen nine li in the morning market, and five qian eight fen eight li eight hao seven suddenly half in the midday market. As a result, there was only a difference of one hao two in the two markets. In the early market, 90,000 corners were traded, and in the midday market, 25,000 corners were traded. Copper coins then increased by 1,500 characters, calculated as 427,000 characters. There were also many transactions, calculated as more than 46,000 strings, with a total price of 10,800 taels of silver.</p>
<p>Silver Collection and Transfer Were Extremely Simple: Because of the afternoon closure, many collections and transfers that should have been accepted were left unsigned and will be processed again when the store opens next week. Therefore, there were very few yesterday. Chinese merchants collected and transferred 1.78 million notes, and foreign merchants collected and transferred 1.34 million notes. The collection and transfer of various types of goods exchange taxes and miscellaneous funds totaled more than 6 million. There were no transactions of pawned funds. The external market inflow and outflow were flat. Chinese merchants entered the warehouse 500,000, and Qianzhuang Yinjiao single collection and transfer were more than 25 million, and the head collection and transfer were more than 3.4 million, and the exchange collection and transfer from all over the road were more than 400,000, and the cash transfer was 450,000.</p>
<p>Ocean Transactions Were Extremely Quiet in the Midday Market: Ocean Fund Transactions Were Particularly Quiet in the Midday Market. Exchange transfers made 550,000 in the early market, and only 300,000 in the midday market, which was even worse than last Sunday. Banknotes were 40,000 in the early market and 15,000 in the midday market. Off-market banknotes were 75,000 in the early market and 40,000 in the midday market. Inter-market transactions between banks were 500,000 in the early market and 400,000 in the midday market. Ocean account transfers between banks were more than 1.2 million, and banknote inflow and outflow were more than 1.6 million.

Ocean fund borrowing inflow and outflow were more than 1.3 million, and small Qianzhuang transactions were 450,000, and the customer road went away 300,000.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Securities Bonds and Futures Continued to Be Strong <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday (23rd), the market conditions of the various bonds of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, the spot goods were still clear, only cutting soldiers by 1,900,000 yuan each, and the rest were without market, but the futures market was for the price to continue to be strong, and the transaction was more prosperous than before. The inflow and outflow transactions of all parties were particularly active, and a total of 5.7 million yuan was opened in both markets. The central salt tax accounted for 1.33 million yuan, the consolidated tax was 1.02 million, the 20th customs roll cut soldiers by about 600,000 each, the 19th good 410,000, and the others were clearer. 96 financial each only 5,000 yuan. Regarding the trend of various bond prices, in the early morning market, the market atmosphere continued to be good, and the buying and selling transactions of all parties were more prosperous than the sellers. The price continued to rise across the board compared with the previous day, and there were many types that had good seven or eight corners or so. In the second market, the buying momentum gradually weakened, and the price rotated to see small. As a result, it generally continued to rise by three or four corners or so compared with the previous day, but the next month's futures of 19 Good and 96 futures and 20 volumes of consolidated tax and other futures slightly returned to fatigue, and the numbers were very small. It is observed that the market conditions of the bonds have gradually become stable.</p>

<h3 id="e187">This Week's New York Stock Market is Thriving <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>(U.S. East Silver Company Weekend Report)</p>
<p>This week's New York stock market found a good sign unseen since the beginning of the wood year. Recently, there have been many good developments in international politics, and U.S. general industry and commerce have also found solid signs of progress. Therefore, since Wednesday, stock market prices have continued to rise. Public bonds have begun to rebound since the beginning of this month, and have become increasingly strong recently. In terms of transactions, general brokers still took a wait-and-see attitude at first. By Friday, the transaction volume reached 1.4 million shares. At this time, the market began to return to a high level of activity. This week, the Dow Jones three indexes have made solid progress, among which the automotive, railway, food, shipping, and entertainment stocks are the strongest. On Friday, there was a lot of good news in the economic world. The hope of the U.S. Steel Corporation (i.e. US Steel) restoring dividends, and the recent production rate of the national steel industry are also continuing to progress. Last week's automobile production increased to 5,219 vehicles. The profits earned by the railway industry in the first half of this year are still satisfactory. The unemployment relief plan has been approved by President Hoover, which can remove general anxieties. The current stock market situation is indeed very good. Although according to market experience, a reaction may occur next week, the stock market is likely to take the opportunity to sell after a sharp rise. This will not hinder the overall trend. If commerce can improve day by day in the future, people's hearts will become stronger and stronger, and the stock market will recover from stripping, this is the time. Attached Dow Jones Index is as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e188">Continued Rise in Yarn Prices <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Cotton Yarn Market Conditions: Prices continue to rise, mainly due to successive purchases from various Guangdong and South China merchants. Existing Shanghai yarn has been almost entirely bought up, leading to talks of shortages. However, some manufacturers still have stock, although the most popular yarns are in short supply. In the past two days, Guangdong merchants have primarily purchased yarn with delivery dates of eight, nine, and thirteen months, causing continued market tension. It is estimated that Guangdong and Yunnan merchants have bought approximately 30,000 to 50,000 units of spot and futures contracts in the past few days, mostly futures contracts that have not yet been shipped. Inquiries reveal that buyers maintain strong expectations for higher prices, due to recent extremely hot weather reducing production in various factories, increasing the number of buyers. However, some have considered short selling, and the bullish side has seen some profit-taking.</p>
<p>People's Standard (Ren Biao) Breaks Through 50 Taels: At the opening of the People's Standard market, it was rumored that demand was strong the previous day, and market sentiment was particularly tight. Individual investors covered their positions, with prices rising by 8 to 9 candareens across all months. In the second and third trading sessions, new short positions were opened, slightly flattening the market. Ultimately, the current month rose by 1 tael and 3 candareens, and distant months rose by 4 to 5 candareens. Total trading volume was 42,000 bales. Rongxing sold 950 bales, Shenji 1,000 bales, Dafu 650 bales, Daji 950 bales, and Taichang 850 bales. Changfeng bought 1,400 bales, Renfeng 1,300 bales, Yiyu 900 bales, Gengfeng 800 bales, Suilong 700 bales, Dafeng 750 bales, and Yuantai 800 bales. The closing prices of People's Standard are listed below:</p>
<p>People's Standard Closing Prices, Gains/Losses, and Open Interest:</p>
<p>November: 150.2 taels, up 5 candareens, open interest 80</p>
<p>July: 149 taels, up 1 tael 3 candareens, open interest 950</p>
<p>November: 150.1 taels, open interest 484,550</p>
<p>August: 150.4 taels, up 6 candareens, open interest 35,300</p>

<p>Guangdong: 3,840 bales; Shantou: 300 bales; Inland: 55 bales; Changsha: 2,100 bales; Sichuan: 215 bales; Anqing: 100 bales; Fujian: 125 bales; Northern Merchants: 80 bales; Fellow Traders: 50 bales; Jiangxi: 300 bales; Ningbo: 85 bales; Total: 7,300 bales</p>
<h3 id="e189">Cotton Firming <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market is quite stable and firm due to rising US cotton prices and increasing yarn prices, which have a correlated effect on raw cotton. Factories are also making occasional purchases, unlike the sluggishness of previous days. Therefore, bullish investors are buying and holding. However, large investors view the US cotton situation as average and are heavily short selling, also holding steady. The future of the cotton market will have significant changes, as trading volumes on both the long and short sides are substantial.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard (Zheng Biao) Continues to Rise by 4 Candareens: At the opening of the Zheng Standard market, rising US cotton prices led to stronger buying sentiment. Prices rose by 2 candareens across all months. In the second and third trading sessions, yarn prices rose again, further boosting market sentiment, with prices rising by 2.5 to 4 candareens across all months. Total trading volume was 66,400 piculs. Yuanda sold 6,200 piculs, Zhenda 1,900 piculs, Yukang 1,000 piculs, Tongfu 1,400 piculs, and Xincheng 900 piculs.

<p>Total: open interest 638,000</p>
<p>October: 31.50 taels, up 1.25 candareens, open interest 167,400</p>

<p>Dry Weather Does Not Hinder New Cotton Crop</p>
<p>New York, July 22 Telegram reports on the past week's cotton market: The cotton market fluctuated within limited ranges this week. The impact of the current weather on the final cotton harvest is still uncertain, which has restricted trading. Limited profit-taking and sales were absorbed by short covering and industry buying. Except for occasional showers, the weather remains dry, and maximum temperatures in many areas have risen to or above 100 degrees Fahrenheit. This is considered beneficial in controlling boll weevil infestations. However, the sudden heat following rainfall has caused boll shedding and deterioration of cotton quality in some areas. There are expectations that if the heatwave continues for another week, production conditions will rapidly decline. Small batches of October contracts have been sold frequently, and it is estimated that cooperative brokers sold a total of 100,000 bales in the past ten days, which has drawn criticism. It is expected that futures trading will become more active when the new cotton crop begins to be listed. Weekend statistics are attached below (in thousands of bales):</p>

<p>Few Ships Arrived in South Shanghai Yesterday; Production Areas Calling for Higher Prices, Shanghai Also Showing Upward Trend: Morning market attendance was relatively high, buyers were interested in increasing inventory. High-grade japonica rice saw prices rise by 3 to 4 jiao. Early rice and improved varieties also saw reduced arrivals, with prices rising by 1 to 2 jiao. Light rice arrivals and sales were balanced, with no price changes. Cloudy weather led to a lack of goods and no market for Yuan rice.</p>
<p>Less than Ten Ships Arrived at New Zhabei Yesterday; Limited Arrivals of Northern Japonica Rice, Spot Transactions Near 1,000 Shi; High-quality prices stabilized, ordinary grades rose by 2 to 3 chi; Kunshan and Jiangyin rice also followed with similar gains. Early light rice sales were slow, prices remained stable. Improved varieties saw weak arrivals and sales, with no price increases. Limited Cloudy weather rice available, prices rose by jiao.</p>

<p>Foreign rice sales were relatively active yesterday. Ningbo merchants continued to ship. Local sales were also strong, and prices saw a slight rebound of several fen. If there are more significant sales today and tomorrow, the market may become firmer. The general market opened with 6,500 bags of small-grain rice, of which 1,000 bags of old small-grain rice were shipped by Ningbo merchants, and the rest were distributed to local and inland villages. New small-grain rice was priced between 9.10 and 8.85 yuan, old small-grain rice between 8.80 and 8.75 yuan. Additionally, 1,000 bags of red small-grain rice were shipped to Ningbo merchants at a price of 8 yuan. Old small-grain and red rice were both 5 fen higher than other grades. In addition to small-grain rice, 100 bags of Jiangxi machine-milled Yuan rice were sold locally at a price of 13.97 yuan.</p>

<p>Foreign Wheat Prices Reported Higher... Tianjin Sales Active</p>
<p>After the opening of the flour market yesterday morning, all months saw slightly increased market sentiment due to foreign wheat prices being reported approximately 4 jiao higher. Therefore, opening prices were stable. Later, outside bullish investors, noting that Tianjin was purchasing large quantities of spot flour, believed that sales would become active in the future and continued to buy, causing prices to rise rapidly. Manufacturers, except for Fufeng, showed little activity. Therefore, the market was exceptionally strong. However, it should be noted that if local flour prices become too high, imported flour will inevitably follow suit and increase orders. As a result, the current month rose by 1.5 fen compared to the previous day, August rose by 2.5 fen, September rose by 2.25 fen, and October to December each rose by 1.75 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Wheat Futures Market Booming <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>After the opening of the wheat futures market yesterday morning, all months suddenly showed booming market conditions. At the beginning of trading, market sentiment was firm due to foreign wheat prices being reported 4 jiao higher. Later, due to the strong flour market, outside bullish investors raised prices accordingly, as if both the flour and wheat markets were similarly speculative. At present, commodity prices are too low, which is greatly impacting farmers' livelihoods. This situation is not necessarily bad. However, the wheat owned by farmers has already been sold, and the beneficiaries are none other than merchants. As a result, the current month rose by 5 fen compared to the previous day, August rose by 6 fen, September and October rose by 5 fen, and November rose by 4 fen. Spot wheat market conditions: due to rising standards, high-quality goods are in demand. Chuzhou wheat opened at 3.2 taels, Suqian wheat at 3.11 taels, Danyang wheat at 2.99 taels, Taicang wheat at 2.856 taels, Jiading wheat at 2.83 taels, and Lujiabang wheat at 2.83 taels, with over 1,500 bags opened.</p>

<p>Over 1200 cases of new Haikou branch arrived the day before yesterday, and samples were already seen yesterday, which were opened by various South and North City merchants. Among them, the top-grade Shuidong branch was priced at 16 taels, followed by 13 to 14 taels, Haikou branch at 11 to 12 taels, and unified goods at 9 taels, which was 1 tael higher than the previous high-grade and 3 qian higher for the low-grade, which was caused by its suitable price and active sales. Its trend is undiminished, and the market can be expected to be stable.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the local silk market remained silent, and sales of raw silk and warp silk from white factories to silk merchants also remained sluggish. Yesterday, only Suzhou Silk Factory purchased 5 bales of white factory warp silk with Dancing Brand thirteen to twenty-two threads at a price of 540 taels, and Hu Silk Factory purchased 5 bales of double spring brand with thirteen to fifteen threads at a price of 530 taels.</p>

<p>Yesterday, British and French experts have begun to handle Wuyuan Gaozhuang Precious Eyebrow Green Tea. According to observations from general tea merchants, the market for this type of tea is expected to develop significantly next week. Tunxi and Shexian Precious Eyebrow teas continued to be actively sold yesterday, with needle-shaped and shoulder-shaped styles being particularly popular. However, large-volume transactions have become stagnant again. There were no transactions for Ping Shui and Zhuang Road teas. There have also been no inquiries about Qining black tea in recent days.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sales of plain blue-gray woolen fabric were still good, and the market at the association was also very active. The yellow-gray color was even more popular, as Sichuan merchants continued to make transactions daily. It is noted that this fabric is specifically used for Western-style suits and hoods. However, the current stock on the market is limited, and new arrivals are very rare. The strong purchasing power of Sichuan merchants has led to demand exceeding supply, and holders of existing stock have collectively raised their selling prices. Yesterday, Xianglihe plain woolen fabric was sold at a uniform price of 3.4 taels, and Ningfeng Dafugui was sold at 3.175 taels.</p>

However, there are still over 3,000 tons of coal dust available. Coal dust sales have suddenly become active in the past two days, with 200 to 300 tons being sold daily. Selling prices have therefore firmed up. Yesterday's opening price at the tea house was 8.75 taels per ton.</p>

<h3 id="e203">Mussolini's Words <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Fo</p>
<p>Italian Prime Minister Mussolini recently explained the meaning of Fascism, with several statements including:</p>
<p>From the perspective of Fascism, life is a struggle. Every individual must first restrain themselves to forge themselves into a valuable tool capable of serving themselves, serving the country, and serving the people. Originally, whatever a person does, they must first set an example for themselves to be effective. If one cannot restrain oneself first, and then wants to restrain others, this is simply impossible. Therefore, the ancients had a saying, "If you want to establish yourself, establish others; if you want to achieve yourself, achieve others." If you want to establish and achieve yourself but do not want to establish and achieve others, this is focusing solely on self-cultivation and completely not understanding the principle of empathy. Therefore, if you want others to be established and achieved, you must first establish and achieve yourself. If you want others to restrain themselves, you must first restrain yourself so that you are not subject to criticism and can be effective.</p>
<p>Since Italian Prime Minister Mussolini organized the Blackshirt Party, it has achieved considerable success. As a result, those inclined towards militarism have become eager to try. The organization of Fascism by Japanese warlords is an example of this. However, the political ideology of a country originally arises in response to the political environment. Therefore, a political situation of one era gives rise to the political ideology of that era. Since the European War, political thought has undergone a sudden change. One type is active Blackshirtism, and the other is passive Communism. These two ideologies were born in response to this trend and have achieved considerable success. However, which ideology is suitable for our country to adapt to the trend depends on the national conditions and the national character, and there is no need to discuss it further.</p>
<p>However, Mussolini's statement that one must first restrain oneself in order to serve the country and serve the people is truly a profound and famous saying. If one can put these words into practice, regardless of the ideology, whether in power or in opposition, it will naturally be effective. For example, Indian Gandhi advocates non-resistance and sets an example everywhere, restraining himself. How is his ability to influence others? What is the effect of what he does? Otherwise, even if one shouts about what ideology and what policies every day, it will only be a waste of effort.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Can the Environment be Reformed? A Discussion at the Society for Social Reform <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Proposal by Huang Juemin</p>
<p>Can the environment be reformed? This is the proposal I have submitted to the Society for Social Reform. Below is my personal discussion of this issue.</p>
<p>Speaking of reforming the environment, the first step, I feel, is to first clarify the true meaning of the environment. To understand the true meaning of the environment, it is best to cite Dewey's theory.</p>
<p>Dewey said: "(Environment is a specialized term in biology and occupies a very important position in the concept of evolution. All organic bodies, on the one hand, must rely on surrounding objects to maintain their lives, and on the other hand, these objects surrounding them can affect their activities)."</p>
<p>Based on this passage, we can derive two key points:</p>
<p>(1) All circumstances that promote biological activity are the environment.</p>
<p>(2) All circumstances that hinder biological activity are also the environment.</p>
<p>However, the environment we usually refer to mostly refers to the latter, and the scope of discussion in this article is also limited to the latter.</p>
<p>I dare say that, except for the "son of heaven", most people are dominated by the environment and oppressed by the environment. Is this domination, this oppression, fundamentally impossible for us to escape? I also dare say that, except for "madmen", everyone can reform their environment, because only madmen will not move their feet but will create thousands of difficulties in their minds.</p>
<p>So, what are the methods for reforming the environment? Based on my experience in fighting the environment in recent years, I believe there are four effective methods:</p>
<p>(1) Strong will! This point is clear to everyone, but it is the most difficult for everyone to achieve. In fact, I feel that since people must ultimately live and be active on the earth, they should not think that they have failed and fled at the first sign of difficulty and obstruction in life. They must possess a persevering will and fight the environment to the end. The ability to reform the environment relies on determination, and the ability to reform to the end relies on perseverance. I hope everyone will not forget this sentence.</p>
<p>(2) Extreme Patience: To solve problems, you must go through considerable procedures and time. The more difficult the problem, the more troublesome the solution procedures are and the longer the time it takes. This is an unbreakable fact that cannot be tricked. Therefore, when we are solving a problem, we must have extreme patience and tolerate the necessary passage of trouble and time.</p>
<p>(3) Beautiful Habits! In the process of striving to reform the environment, you must develop extremely beautiful habits to continue to struggle constantly. This habit is that when difficult problems come, we only allow them to arouse our consideration, and we do not allow them to arouse our worries. Only in this way, although the external pressure is severe, and our body and mind are inevitably exhausted due to our efforts to cope with difficulties, we can maintain mental composure and inner peace, and not be internally injured as a result, and can nurture our strength to continue to fight the environment. The final victory will inevitably belong to us.</p>
<p>(4) Appropriate Ambition! Any career that is within my ability and that I desire is an appropriate ambition. I believe that our contribution to society is not to become so-called great people. As long as each person makes the greatest possible effort to contribute to the best of their ability, that is the greatest contribution to society. If it can be weighed, I believe that such a contribution is by no means smaller than the contribution of great people. Perhaps in some places, the contribution of great people is not as great as such a contribution. Our worst mentality is to specialize in admiring the accomplished careers of others, or to be driven by vanity, resulting in suppressing our own strengths and failing to achieve any success. Therefore, we fall into a painful environment and cannot extricate ourselves. Therefore, if you want to reform the environment, you must follow a path that is within your ability to be invincible.</p>
<p>People oppressed by the environment! What do you think of these contributions? If it is not correct, please advise. If it is correct, please do it quickly. A bright realm is in front of us!</p>
<h3 id="e205">Regarding the Proposal to Publish a Special Issue and That Non-Members Should Also be Allowed to Participate in Discussions to Achieve Great Results <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>To the Editor: I recently saw the short notice and several articles of the Society for Social Reform, and I am very impressed! In accordance with Article 2 of the charter, I venture to offer two suggestions, not knowing if they are appropriate. I hope they will be discussed and decided upon! Sincerely, Shanghai Newspaper Local Supplement, Society for Social Reform.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Xiao Kangshi, July 22</p>
<p>1. For all writings within the scope of the Society for Social Reform discussion, I believe that a special issue should be published, once or twice every weekday, to clarify the boundaries and awaken the minds.</p>
<p>2. All non-members should also be allowed to participate in discussions, and once they are recorded, they should be advanced to membership and strive to implement them to achieve great results, so as not to lose the will of the Society for Social Reform.</p>
<p>(Note: (The matter of issuing a special issue in the previous article needs to be discussed with the museum authorities before it can be handled. The original intention of the latter article that non-members can also participate in discussions was originally like this, so the gentlemen who contribute to this journal include both those who have contributed and those who have not contributed. - Editor's Note)</p>

<h3 id="e208">The Manufacturing of Spirits <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Lüshuang</p>
<p>Answering Mr. Pingzhang</p>
<p>The method of manufacturing spirits cannot be fully explained in just one or two pieces of paper. Since you have asked, I will simply describe what I know to the best of my ability.</p>
<p>(1) The Method of Manufacturing Methanol: Place wood blocks in an iron still for dry distillation. The still has only one outlet, so that the evaporated substances can be released while outside air cannot enter. After all the volatile substances have been evaporated, what remains is charcoal, which can be used as fuel. The evaporated substances are passed through a condenser. A portion of it becomes liquid, while another portion remains as gas, containing light gas, carbon monoxide, etc., which can be passed into a gas storage tank and used as fuel. The condensed liquid contains tar, one percent methanol, five to eight percent acetic acid, and a small amount of acetone. Tar is insoluble in water, while the rest are soluble in water, so the tar can be separated. However, this aqueous solution still contains a small amount of tar, which can be removed by low-temperature distillation, as tar has a high boiling point and will not evaporate. This evaporated substance is called Pyroligneous acid, and it still contains methanol, acetic acid, and a small amount of acetone. Then, use lime to neutralize the acetic acid to form non-volatile calcium acetate: 2CH3COOH (acetic acid) + CaO (lime) → (CH3COO)2Ca + H2O. Distill again to obtain a mixed liquid of methanol and ketone. Ketone evaporates more easily than methanol, so fractional distillation can be used to evaporate the ketone first, leaving a mixture of methanol and water. Then, use fractional distillation to evaporate the methanol. The resulting product contains very few impurities.</p>
<p>In summary, the main product is methanol, and the by-products include tar, coke, fuel gas, acetic acid, ketone, etc., all of which have wide applications in daily life and industry.</p>
<p>(2) The Method of Manufacturing Ethanol: The raw materials for making ethanol are generally sweet potatoes, corn flour, lactose, and other various starches and sugars, depending on the prices in different locations.</p>
<p>If the raw material is sugar, only two steps are required: fermentation and distillation. If the raw material is starch, it must first be converted into sugar and then fermented.</p>
<p>First, cook the starch with water for one hour to make a thin starch solution, and then mix it with malt (a type of fermenting agent, English name Malt) until the starch is converted into maltose at the appropriate time. Rinse it out with water to await the second step.</p>
<p>Dilute the sugar with water to make a 10% solution, and add 10% nutrient solution. This solution is synthesized from one gram each of potassium nitrate, magnesium chloride, calcium nitrate, and potassium phosphate, and one hundred cubic centimeters of water, to serve as food for the yeast! Then add a small amount of sulfuric acid to make the solution weakly acidic, so that other harmful bacteria cannot survive. Finally, mix in the yeast. During the fermentation period, a large amount of heat is released, so it must be properly monitored to ensure that the temperature does not exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit. After about a week, distill this solution, and then redistill it (Rectirication), which yields 95% ethanol, containing very few impurities.</p>
<p>If the raw material is sugar, the fermentation and distillation procedures are the same.</p>
<p>The above is a long explanation, only giving a very simple description. If Mr. Pingzhang or other comrades want to research further, they can refer to various industrial chemistry books. Space is limited here, so I cannot describe everything in detail.</p>

<h3 id="e209">The Woes of a Shop Assistant <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Cangping</p>
<p>After much effort, I finally broke through after three years of sweeping floors and wiping tables, and became a shop assistant.</p>
<p>In my student days, looking forward to being a shop assistant was like a student looking forward to becoming a Ph.D. I thought that becoming a shop assistant would bring more wealth and that I could do more high-level things. I thought that the plans I had in mind could be realized, and I could gradually move up, from shop assistant to manager, from manager to boss. I thought that becoming a boss would bring wealth, and that with wealth, I could establish a business. I thought that everything in my ideal could be solved.</p>
<p>But in reality, it is not that easy. I started as a shop assistant at the age of seventeen, and now at the age of twenty-five, I am still a shop assistant. The experience and conditions I have gained from being a shop assistant for these nine years are as follows:</p>
<p>You should respect your superiors' orders. You cannot complain about the smell of their farts. You must be loyal to the boss and deceitful to others. You should shed every drop of sweat for him. Don't ask about the tens of thousands of gold coins he earns. If you are already married, it is best to have your wife live like a widow, while he has three or four concubines, and cannot be without them for a day. This is an entitlement he earned in his previous life. Most importantly, you cannot get too old. If you are full of sorrow and your eyes are dim, you should be sensible and roll up your bedding and go home, sparing him the trouble of saying it.</p>
<p>What chills me the most is that a shop assistant should not get sick. If an illness drags on, your job is at risk, and your salary will be stopped. Alas! I worry for the shop assistants who have no savings. I cry out loud for the shop assistants who are suffering from the same illness as me. Finally, I pray to God not to add to the suffering of the shop assistants. I silently wish that the old bosses would ease up on the whipping of us suffering and helpless shop assistants.</p>
