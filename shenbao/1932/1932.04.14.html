<h3 id="c1">注意公共租界納税外人會麥氏之報告彬 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>昨日上海公共租界納税外人會舉行二十一年度年會工部局總董麥克諾登君以將退職之總董資格。作極長之報告。中有謂此次中日戰事使租界弱點暴露特區法院袒護抗日運動。爲滬戰原因列强鑒往知來。應細密注意上海地位。末更提出具體主張。建議在上海設立國際法庭。吾人細讀麥氏之之報告後。深感麥氏所言其錯誤不僅爲失之太偏根本未認清此次上海禍變之性質抑且其所提之主張。實含有他種耐人深思之意味故吾人不能不從事實上與理論上予以糾正。</p>
<p>麥氏謂上海中日之戰由於特區法院之袒護抗日運動。斯言也如其出諸日人之口吾人自認事所必然。今出諸麥氏之口則誠爲吾人所大惑。夫抗日運動果何由而來乎。其中果更無致使我國人抗日之因乎。如麥氏不承認日人之侵略行爲爲合理。則去年九一八東北突然之禍變。不能不認爲刺激我國人民感情造成抗日運動之根因。又况此種抗日運動僅限於極其和平之排貨經濟絶交。絶無任何激烈行動旣未妨害租界之秩序。亦未危及友邦僑民之安全。此種極其正當之愛國行爲。吾人絶不能承認其有受任何權力干涉之餘地目前美國亦發生廣大之排斥日貨運動。麥氏對此。感想其又何如。即如此次上海之變事先日人積極挑釁。我已一再退讓。退讓之極。仍不能遏止日人之殺機。終於造成空前之慘禍。論其性質。在日則爲强力侵略在我則爲正當自衛。即遠在歐美之人士亦多深表同情於我國。	麥氏目擊慘變。乃獨反爲强權張目見之偏耶抑麥氏根本承認强權之侵略。國際公約之被撕碎。和平之被破壞。正義之被摧殘爲合理耶。此誠爲人所大惑不解者也。若曰此次中日之戰。已根本暴露租界之弱點。則吾人所見蓋亦略同。特吾人所指者爲租界當局。未能弭止禍變於事先。反劃分虹口一帶爲日軍之防地。以促進禍變之爆發。戰事旣起。復容許日兵武裝通過租界。以租界爲進攻退守之根據地。不能保持租界之中立性。此吾人迄今猶不能不認爲租界當局之爲强力所屈。而深引爲遺憾者也。</p>
<p>至於特區法院原爲一九二七年之臨時法院之改進。臨時法院之設立爲我國與有各關係國政府恊定之試騐。假使臨時法院之成績。不滿人意。則斷不至改進爲今日之特區法院。抑且基於保持中國行政主權之完整一原則而言麥氏對於特區法院。蓋毫無反對之餘地。何况保護愛國運動。即使有之於情於理。亦初無不合。而設立特區法院係由各關係國政府與我國正式恊定。麥氏如尚未容許有公然反對各關係國政府恊定之行動。則吾人亦不能承認麥氏有動搖特區法院之可能性。此則麥氏所又不能不細加考慮者也。</p>
<p>吾人細審麥氏之言。具可見麥氏之着目點不在於中日之戰争問題。亦不在於特區法院問題而在於所謂（上海問題）比日以來。所謂（大上海）（上海自由市）之呼聲甚囂塵上麥氏之主張。在上海組織國際法庭。或其即爲所謂（上海自由市）之先聲耶。假如麥氏之着目點。誠在於。此則吾人不能不認爲麥氏觀念之錯誤。蓋所謂（國際法庭）所謂（上海自由市）不僅爲一（國中之國）爲破壞我國行政主權之完整。抑且我民族今已有顯然之覺醒顯然之進步。正處於積極争取自由平等之奮鬥程途中。此種主張亦斷非我民族所能承認。所能容許其實現者。麥氏如以前三十年之眼光。視今日之中華民族。則事實恰足以説明麥氏三十年如一日。絲毫未有進步耳。</p>
<p>吾人茲謹以友愛視善之忱。忠告麥氏放遠其眼光。爲一時代之人物而勿泥於主觀。囿於偏見。惑於近利徒傷我國人民之感情。</p>

<p>調解之認識　罷工二字、工會未有命令、（甲）根據館方來函附件、所謂工會通告、僅指明對於代印大晚報一節、未得工會同意、不能私印等語、可見工會事前未見有罷工之用意（乙）據熊任二先生及蔣介民先生本人之談話、知館方蔣處長對工會張委員、當時確有争執、及扭赴工部局之表示、又據館方來函、有（一時秩序紛亂、工作遂告停止、其後工會又派人招集全體工友離館）等語、可知工人之離館、及蔣氏處置之失當、有以促成之、（丙）據館方來函、有五時爲平日廣告版排字時間、未見工友回館、至八時、爲平日新聞版排字時間、亦無工友來館工作、待至九時餘、館方祗有堆積稿件、仍無工友一人、敝館見此情狀、逆其他工友被迫罷工、又據館方負責人談話、館方根據密報、恐工方破壞資方財産、故即報告捕房、武力保護、同時據工方負責人談、工方根據密報、恐館方妨碍工人自由運動、故相率不進館工作、及十時許、工人前去探聽消息、竟被館方藉巡捕武力、而软禁館内、根據上述事實、及該工會宣言、更可證明工會並無罷工之命令（丁）館方恢復行政管理權之予盾性、據館方負責人談、平日館方之行政管理權、每被工會之掣肘、所以乘此機會、對工人以塡志願書、服從館章爲先决條件、而敝會等亦以此節理由、頗有可取、乃有第一項之意見、不料館方對恢復四月二日以前狀態之辦法、因已塡志願書入館工作工友之反對、而不能接受、則未免前後予盾、</p>
<p>結束幾句話、總之敝會等、旣不願工人之失業、亦不願新聞事業之破壞、更不顧在國難時期發生内争、而長日人之意氣、所有調解意見乃持無私之表現、而工方寗犧牲一切、只求工友之不失業、尚不能得對方之諒解、至功敗且夕、惟自愧誠不足以動人、義不足以感衆、信望未孚、有以致之耳、祇將調解一事暫告停止　、如前途有圓轉之機、而須敝會等供奔走者、則敝會等亦何辭焉、願各界人士有以教之、上海郵務工會·上海郵務職工會、</p>

<p>國民十二日日内瓦電　國聯理事會今日舉行特别會議、考慮援助中歐各國財政問題、法總理泰狄歐主席、當即通過一决議案、由日前在倫敦會議未有結果之英法意德四國推派代表、會同國聯財政專家、重行審查國聯財政委員會報告書、俟得審查報告、再於援助方式作最後之决定、現料理事會對於援助急如火焚之多瑙河各國財政、經此一番審查後、在五月九日例會以前、未必能有所行動、而一般觀察時事者、更懷疑審查之際、對於根本之大綱、能否早日商得同意、蓋派遣代表之四國、限日前在倫敦未能有所成議之四國、各國明知中歐各國財政之昭蘇、與彼有重要利益、但爲保障自私自利之國家權利計、遂致造成僵局、今乃希望藉國聯專家之斡旋、以打破此僵局云、</p>

<p>國民社十二日日内瓦電　國際軍縮大會總委員會、今日下午繼續作一般的討論、漢德森主席、法總理泰狄歐演説、攻擊昨日美代表吉白生所提廢除坦克車大砲與化學戰具之議、堅稱此項提議、不能解决軍縮問題、唯有施行法國方案、冀將來可造成一種國際權威、有制裁之力、最後並警告委員會勿徒爲目前應急之决議、委員會旋即散會、以便泰狄歐前往主席國聯理事會、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯十二日巴黎電　泰狄歐在軍縮會議之演説、其言有云、倘一國對於凱洛格非戰公約、放棄以戰争爲政治工具之規定、敢於侵犯、則對於其他次要規定、如禁止保有或使用某種軍械之類、自更肆無忌憚、以故監察之制、實不可缺、而製裁尤爲必要、法國提議所以主張何人侵犯規約、何人即應斷爲侵略者、即以此也、由質地上廢除軍械、不惟不能使各國躋於平等、且其性質虚矯、而不切於實際、蓋無論何種軍械可用於攻擊者、未嘗不可用於防禦、反之防禦之軍器移爲攻擊、亦未始不可、欲救此弊、仍以防止一切戰争、爲不二法門、然欲如是、必使國際機關握有最强之武器、任何國家之兵力、莫出其右然後可、法國提案恰遵盟約精神、一方爲預防、而一方又爲制裁、求其成一切實保障之方法、其精義即在於此、此種提案係對於軍縮問題、作一積極之答案、固不似主張質的上廢除軍械者之徒託空言也</p>

<p>彈丸　彈丸因各種槍砲而不同。槍彈已如上所述。現在把砲彈簡單的説一説。砲彈中的野砲彈。有榴彈。榴霰彈。燒夷彈。尖鋭彈。烟幕彈。照明彈，瓦斯彈。信號彈等。各種砲彈。都有特殊的效用。或用以炸燬破壞建築物。或用以窒息屠殺人畜。或爲燃燒毒化遠距離陣地。大槪依作戰時的情形。酌量使用。又裝載於這類彈丸依所望的位置與時期。有着火炸裂的信管。這管也分瞬發信管。短延期信管。高射用信管。導火信管。近來對於導火信管。爲減少空中氣壓。改良火藥燃燒力的不平均。復用時計與電力。裝置發明機械信管與電力信管。且又爲聯絡信管與彈丸二者的關係。造成特種彈丸。就是要想彈丸射達某地時。賴信管的作用。能把裝置於底部的特種炸彈上一部分着火。藉此噴出瓦斯。再以反動作用，能推進到很遠的距離。這種彈丸。名呌落開脱Ｒocket應用彈。其他種類甚多。如葡萄彈。連鎖彈，鐵筒彈。硫磺彈等。不勝枚舉。依各種槍砲的形狀與放射的效用。外形與内部。隨之而差異。這回日軍在閘北用的。多爲榴霰彈燒夷彈。由空中投炸的。爲燒夷爆彈與破甲爆彈。彈的重量。在二千瓩以上三千瓲以下。吴淞倫渡時所用的。爲烟幕彈。據本報目擊者所述。在江灣吴淞閘北等處瓦礫堆中所拾得的彈殼推想。大者達三百磅。因此足以證明這回受害的重大了。</p>

<p>矮子爲什麽不開口呢？艙裏的乘客早已胸中雪亮，他是開口不得的了，一定是奸細，一定是舶來品的矮子，這是衆人胸中毫無遲疑的答案·於是，燄燄地焚起愛國之火！船中混入了奸細，還當了得，非得把他捉住不可·待要告發，非得秘密通知軍警，把他扣留不可。</p>
<p>一個個的交頭接耳，竊竊私議，用着螞蟻傳信的方法，無多時刻，全船都已知曉了，船到××鎭，向例不停泊的；船老大宣言修理機件有一小時的停泊輪船和拖船便一一的停頓了。</p>
<p>水警一小隊，奉命上船檢查；在先，便是四個匣子砲，對準着衆人注目的矮子；勒令他上岸受檢。</p>
<p>矮子不慌不忙的上岸受檢，水警們剝去矮子的外罩大衣，那便水落石出了，裏面有徽章，有符號，分明是×××軍的宣傳部人員，衣袋裏還有奉公差遣的文牘，何嘗是奸細，何嘗是舶來品的矮子，他只是赴滬公幹的軍界人物。</p>
<p>默不作聲的矮子，這時也開口了，聽他的説話，是純綷粤音，尤其可以證明他確是國産的矮子，而非舶來品的矮子·當水警們問他坐在艙中時，爲什麽默不作聲，惹人家疑懼？他指着右腮所貼的膏藥，聲明自已正患着風火牙疼，憚於和人家説話·再者，本人是粤産，同舟的大抵是蘇滬人物；他們操着土音來動問，自已聽了不甚了了，只好點一回頭，做這種種的表示。</p>
<p>水警們向矮子道歉，　同時又追究這報密的人，不該捕風捉影，輕事重報，以致發生這誤會。</p>
<p>報密的人，不免驚惶失色了，照着誣告反坐的法律，自已便得捱受一塲官司·水警們又不肯放鬆，定要把他捉將官裏去，轉是這位國産的矮子，向着水警，替那報密的人緩頰：</p>
<p>丨他不是有意誣陷我，實在我有可以使人疑惑的理由·千不好，萬不好，都是我害着牙疼的不好·我對於報密的人，毫不抱怨，反而表示着充分的欽佩·要是，人人對於檢舉奸細，都有這船的注意；那麽，敵人的間諜，决不敢深入内地，如入無人之境了·我雖然受了一些兒麻煩，却起了無窮的欣幸；欣幸人心未死，個個都能盡他們破獲間諜的義務，話説的太多了，牙疼又發作了，我們下船去吧。</p>
<p>汽笛一聲，小輸又向前開動了·方才的疑雲，早已化爲鳥有；船裏面充滿着融融洩洩的空氣·旣没有交頭接耳，也没有竊竊私語；方才向着矮子白眼相加的，現在却向着矮子笑顔相向。</p>

<p>— 金</p>
<p>（調查團今晚九時半·在北京飯店開盛大跳無會，張學良，于鳳至，顧維鈞夫人，沈能毅夫婦，及中外要人，均往參加·）</p>
<p>昨日本報北平專電有這樣一段消息，當時我讀完了這段新聞，不禁鼓掌狂喜·</p>
<p>張學良氏本來豁達大度，除了殺父之仇不報外，即亡國亡家之讐，亦恝然置諸度外，並不計較，他又酷愛和平，始終抱定不抵抗主義，故日本得以安安全全，於數日之間便完全占領了東三省的全部，張學良（仇恩平視）的態度，無論何人，不能不深深地拜服，張學良氏更有一件拿手好戲爲世人所共知的，便是（跳舞專家，）他現在是中央執行委員，又可説他是一位（跳舞委員，一這樣的頭銜加在他的頭上，眞可説受之無愧了·</p>
<p>曾憶去年東北九一八事變發生時，北平大閙尋覓張學良不着，後來於某貴族式之跳舞塲中，方才找了出來，其時張氏正在淺紅淡綠的電燈光中，擁着舞女，踏着「華爾慈的」步調，表演他的拿手好戲，於是一般不懂世故人情的激烈份子·便破口大駡他是（跳舞亡國，）我説不然，張爲良便不跳舞，亦安能使其國不亡，跳舞畢竟有絶妙用處·</p>
<p>（跳舞救國，）原爲現在最新鮮最時髦的一個名詞，但我總不相信跳舞能夠救國，豈知國聯調查團，前日道出日本，日本政府竭誠歡迎，今日開大宴會，明日開跳舞會，貴族女子，各執花圈，殷勤致送，這個（温柔式）的外交，實在令人望洋興歎，得未曾有，因此調查團不便拂日政府的盛情，在日勾留約有二星期之久，我方笑自已頭腦之冬烘，跳舞救國的意義，原有這樣奇妙的效用·現在調查團到了北平，張學良氏天然當盡其地主之誼，殷勤招待，自不必説，因爲調查團之視察，關係東省問題異常重要也·此次調查團在北京飯店開盛大之跳舞會，這次大會，在名義上似以調查團爲主體，張學良爲客體，但張學良畢竟先有過這樣的讌會，然後調查團亦開大會以答雅意，决無可疑，因此我想到我國的外交，其他手段，比較日本，大大不如，惟跳舞外交，的確是張學良之拿手好戲，救國之道，或亦即在於此，故人謂張學良以跳舞亡國，我只能説張學良能跳舞救國·</p>

<h3 id="e1">ATTENTION TO THE REPORT OF MR. MACKAY OF THE FOREIGN RATEPAYERS' ASSOCIATION OF THE PUBLIC CONCESSION, SHANGHAI <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Foreign Ratepayers' Association of the Shanghai Public Concession held its 21st annual meeting. Mr. MacKinnon, the outgoing Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, delivered a very lengthy report in his capacity as the retiring Chairman. In it, he stated that the recent Sino-Japanese conflict had exposed the weaknesses of the Concession, and that the Special District Court had shielded the anti-Japanese movement, which was the cause of the Shanghai war. He urged the major powers to learn from the past and pay close attention to Shanghai's position. He further proposed concrete measures, suggesting the establishment of an international court in Shanghai. After carefully reading Mr. Mackay's report, we deeply feel that his words are not only excessively biased and fundamentally fail to recognize the nature of the Shanghai disaster, but also that his proposals contain other thought-provoking implications. Therefore, we cannot but correct them from both a factual and theoretical standpoint.</p>
<p>Mr. Mackay said that the Sino-Japanese war in Shanghai was due to the Special District Court's protection of the anti-Japanese movement. If these words had come from the Japanese, we would have considered them inevitable. However, coming from Mr. Mackay, they truly perplex us. What is the origin of the anti-Japanese movement? Is there truly no other cause that led the Chinese people to resist Japan? If Mr. Mackay does not acknowledge the Japanese acts of aggression as justified, then last year's sudden disaster in the Northeast on September 18th must be recognized as the root cause that stimulated the emotions of the Chinese people and created the anti-Japanese movement. Moreover, this kind of anti-Japanese movement was limited to extremely peaceful boycotts and economic severance, with absolutely no violent actions. It neither disrupted the order of the Concession nor endangered the safety of foreign residents. We absolutely cannot acknowledge that this extremely legitimate act of patriotism should be subject to interference by any power. Currently, a widespread boycott of Japanese goods is also taking place in the United States. What are Mr. Mackay's thoughts on this? Moreover, in the recent Shanghai incident, the Japanese actively provoked beforehand, and we repeatedly made concessions. Despite the utmost concessions, we still could not prevent the Japanese intent to kill, which ultimately led to an unprecedented tragedy. In terms of its nature, it was forceful aggression on the part of Japan and legitimate self-defense on our part. Even people far away in Europe and America have expressed deep sympathy for our country. Mr. Mackay witnessed the tragic events, yet he alone speaks on behalf of the powerful. Is he seeing things from a biased perspective, or does Mr. Mackay fundamentally acknowledge the invasion of the powerful, the tearing up of international agreements, the destruction of peace, and the trampling of justice as justified? This is truly perplexing and incomprehensible. If he says that the recent Sino-Japanese war has fundamentally exposed the weaknesses of the Concession, then our view is also somewhat similar. However, what we are referring to is that the Concession authorities failed to prevent the disaster beforehand, and instead demarcated the Hongkou area as a defense zone for the Japanese army, thereby accelerating the outbreak of the disaster. After the war began, they allowed Japanese soldiers to pass through the Concession armed, using the Concession as a base for attack and retreat. They failed to maintain the neutrality of the Concession. We still cannot help but see this as the Concession authorities succumbing to power, and we deeply regret it.</p>
<p>As for the Special District Court, it was originally an improvement on the Provisional Court of 1927. The establishment of the Provisional Court was an experiment agreed upon by our country and the governments of the countries concerned. If the performance of the Provisional Court had not been satisfactory, it would not have been improved into the Special District Court of today. Moreover, based on the principle of maintaining the integrity of China's administrative sovereignty, Mr. Mackay should have no grounds for opposing the Special District Court. Furthermore, protecting the patriotic movement is entirely in accordance with reason and sentiment, even if it exists. The establishment of the Special District Court was formally agreed upon by the governments of the countries concerned and our country. If Mr. Mackay does not yet allow for openly opposing the actions agreed upon by the governments of the countries concerned, then we also cannot acknowledge that Mr. Mackay has the possibility of undermining the Special District Court. This is something that Mr. Mackay must carefully consider again.</p>
<p>After carefully examining Mr. Mackay's words, it is evident that Mr. Mackay's focus is not on the Sino-Japanese war, nor on the Special District Court issue, but rather on the so-called "Shanghai problem." Recently, the clamor for the so-called "Greater Shanghai" and "Free City of Shanghai" has become very loud. Mr. Mackay's proposal to establish an international court in Shanghai, could it be the prelude to the so-called "Free City of Shanghai"? If Mr. Mackay's focus is indeed on this, then we cannot but recognize the error of Mr. Mackay's view. The so-called "international court" and the so-called "Free City of Shanghai" are not only a "state within a state," undermining the integrity of our country's administrative sovereignty, but also our nation already has an obvious awakening and obvious progress, and is in the midst of an active struggle for freedom and equality. This kind of proposal is absolutely not something that our nation can acknowledge or allow to be realized. If Mr. Mackay views the Chinese nation of today with the eyes of thirty years ago, then the facts are enough to show that Mr. Mackay has not progressed in the slightest in thirty years.</p>
<p>We now sincerely advise Mr. Mackay with affectionate and well-meaning sincerity to broaden his vision and be a person of the times, and not be mired in subjectivity, confined by prejudice, or misled by short-term interests, lest he needlessly wound the feelings of our people.</p>
<h3 id="e2">POSTPONEMENT OF THE ARMISTICE CONFERENCE PLENARY SESSION RESOLVED <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>▲ Our Representative Notifies the Japanese Ambassador</p>
<p>▲ British Counselor and Others Negotiate Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>▲ Subcommittee Meeting Continues This Morning</p>
<p>The Sino-Japanese Armistice and Troop Withdrawal Conference has encountered obstacles and has been temporarily suspended due to the Japanese side's lack of sincerity in negotiations, pending a decision by the League of Nations. Our chief representative, Guo Taiqi, formally notified the Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu Aoi yesterday via official document that the plenary session must be postponed. However, the subcommittee meeting is scheduled to continue this morning at 10:00 AM at the British Consulate. Last night, our representative, Mr. Guo Taiqi, hosted a banquet at his private residence on Route Lowrie, inviting the British Minister Lampson and counselors from various countries. The situation yesterday is detailed below:</p>
<p>▲ Notification of Plenary Session Postponement The Sino-Japanese Armistice and Troop Withdrawal Conference has been unable to make progress because of Japan's tough stance and our inability to make concessions. Although the British Minister proposed a compromise, the government found it difficult to accept. Therefore, after consideration, we could only report the details of the conference to Geneva representative Yan, and forward it to the League of Nations, in order to seek a clear stipulation from the League of Nations on the deadline for the withdrawal of Japanese troops. Before the League of Nations comes up with a solution, the Shanghai meeting will be suspended, but not ended. The meeting will continue once the League of Nations resolves the issue. Yesterday, Guo Taiqi received instructions from the government to formally notify the Japanese side immediately. Guo then sent Zhang Sixu, Director of the Intelligence Department of the Diplomatic Office, to visit the Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu Aoi at 6:00 PM, stating that "The Chinese government has cabled Dr. Yan Huaiqing, the representative of the League of Nations, requesting the League of Nations to clearly stipulate the deadline for the withdrawal of your country's troops. As the League of Nations has not yet replied, the plenary session must be postponed." It is also heard that our representative will notify the British Minister of the same note, asking him to inform the countries concerned.</p>
<p>▲ Subcommittee Meeting This Morning At the subcommittee meeting on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, the Japanese side raised the issue of the stationing of our troops in Pudong and south of the Suzhou Creek, which exceeded the scope of the League of Nations resolution and the Armistice Agreement. Our representatives Huang and Guo sternly rejected this, resulting in a stalemate. Subsequently, the counselors of various friendly nations mediated and set the meeting to be adjourned for one day and continue today. However, our representatives Huang and Guo intend to reject this pointless discussion because Japan has consistently lacked sincerity, and will report the details to our chief representative, Guo Taiqi. However, the counselors of various friendly nations are sincerely afraid that if today's meeting is suspended, the outside world will become increasingly suspicious. Therefore, the American Counselor Trestaël, the French Counselor Pannavete, and the Italian Counselor Faratini, accompanied our representatives Huang Qiang and Guo Dehua to the British Consulate at around 10:00 AM yesterday morning to meet with the British Counselor Sanshill and continue the discussion. Our side immediately agreed because we were touched by the kindness of the friendly nations. However, it was expressed that we would resolutely reject all discussions that exceeded the scope of the Japanese side. According to Guo, the Vice Minister, the subcommittee meeting will continue to negotiate at 10:00 AM this morning at the request of the counselors of various friendly nations.</p>
<p>▲ Guo Taiqi Banquets the British Minister The chief representative of our side for the Armistice Conference, Mr. Guo Taiqi, felt that the British Minister to China, Mr. Lampson, had put in a lot of hard work in coordinating the conference. Although the conference has now been suspended, Lampson has also received news of his departure to the north. Therefore, Guo hosted a banquet at his private residence on Route Lowrie last night and invited Li Shizeng, Huang Qiang, Zhang Sixu, and the secretaries of the British Legation, Taker Man and Stollin, as well as the secretaries of the American Legation, Engel, and the secretary of the French Legation, Laguet, who were involved in the conference. During the banquet, Representative Guo also declared to Lampson that the Armistice Conference had been handed over to the League of Nations by the National Government for resolution in order to break the deadlock. The Armistice Conference may be expected to turn around after the meeting of the League of Nations Special Committee on the 16th. Please postpone your departure to the north for the time being. It is heard that Minister Lan has agreed to postpone his departure temporarily, and the guests and hosts parted happily at around 9:00 PM.</p>
<p>▲ Representatives Pay a Visit to Guo Yesterday The United Association of National Salvation Organizations specially sent representatives Li Cishan and five others at 9:00 AM yesterday morning to present a letter to Guo Taiqi, requesting that the Armistice and Troop Withdrawal Conference be stopped immediately. Guo was out on official business, so he was received by Zhang Sixu, the Director of the Intelligence Department. According to Zhang, our side has decided to issue a declaration regarding the Armistice Conference to report the past facts to the outside world, etc. The letter from the United Association of National Salvation Organizations to Representatives Guo Taiqi and Dai Ji is recorded below: Reverently, Shanghai's Armistice and Troop Withdrawal Conference has become a troop stationing conference due to the Japanese side's lack of sincerity. For example, the daily subcommittee meetings are nothing more than discussions of troop stationing locations, giving Chinese and foreigners the impression of ceding territory and seeking peace. The original purpose of the meeting can be said to be completely inconsistent. The Association believes that this kind of conference that does not conform to the facts has no need to continue. Representatives Li Cishan, Liu Shixiong, Hu Juewen, Bei Zuyi, Wang Zaoshi, and Yan Jin were specially sent to the Association to present the following two matters. Please grant your kind attention to public opinion and resolutely adopt: (1) Announce that the Japanese side has no sincerity regarding the troop withdrawal issue, and the Shanghai Troop Withdrawal Conference cannot continue. It has been reported to the League of Nations, please handle it impartially. (2) Announce the accompanying cessation of the subcommittee meeting. As for the detailed reasons, the representatives will explain them in person. Respectfully addressed to Vice Minister Guo and Commander Dai.</p>
<h3 id="e3">MA ZHANSHAN'S REBELLION <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>▲ Two Fine Telegrams Issued</p>
<p>▲ Reporting the Experience of Enduring Humiliation</p>
<p>▲ Collecting Evidence of the Puppet State</p>
<p>▲ Announcing Arrival of the Investigation Team</p>
<p>Ma Zhanshan telegraphed from Heihe on the 9th: "Respectfully to General Zhu Ziqiao and Councilor Han Liru, upon returning to Heihe from Shanghai, I learned in detail of your public's concern and encouragement, and I am deeply grateful. Our troops retreated from Longjiang to Hailun in the past, and exhausted all their strength. Under compulsion, we temporarily cooperated with the Japanese. After returning to the province for more than forty days, I learned deeply of the Japanese conspiracy to fabricate public opinion and deceive the world when the League of Nations investigation team came to the Northeast. Therefore, I secretly distributed the effective troops in advance, [text missing] on the 7th of the month I urgently came to Heihe, and all military and political organs were established that day, and work was carried out as usual, and actively prepared to command the troops, proceed at the right time, and recover the lost land. As for the various conspiracies of the Japanese to create a puppet government in Manchuria, they have been sorted out clearly and made public to the League of Nations investigation team, and to the world, in order to expose their sinister behavior. Zhanshan has been entrusted with important border responsibilities by the country, and only knows to serve the country with his life and resist to the death. As for success or failure, I do not care. I hereby telegraph this in advance, and hope that it will be forwarded to the local gentry in Shanghai for their consideration. Ma Zhanshan respectfully bows, auspiciously printed."</p>
<p>Ma Zhanshan telegraphed from Hailanpao on the 12th: "To General Zhu Ziqiao of China, please quickly forward to Chairman Lin and Chairman Jiang of the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, President Wang of the Executive Yuan, Director Zhang of the Peiping Pacification Headquarters, Chief Counselor Wan, Mr. Wu Ziyu, Director Yan of the Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters, Commander Chen and Chief Commander Jiang and Commander Cai of the Shanghai Garrison, and Mr. Feng Huanzhang of Tai'an: and for the consideration of all departments, committees, offices, and bureaus of the Central Government, party departments and government agencies of all provinces and cities, all military officers, all legal entities, all schools, all newspapers, the Peiping Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, all fathers, elders, brothers, and sisters in the country, and all embassies, consulates, party departments, and overseas Chinese associations abroad: Ever since the brutal Japanese occupied Liaoning and Jilin by force, although their representative, Yoshizawa, repeatedly declared to the international community that he would never destroy the integrity of Chinese territory, in reality, his determination to actively annex Jiang Province became increasingly urgent. At first, he used Zhang Haipeng's troops to attack, and then he openly mobilized a large Japanese army under the pretext of repairing the Jiangqiao Bridge, forcing his way into the provincial capital. Our side, in order to respect the resolutions of the League of Nations and the Non-War Treaty, did its best to avoid conflict, hoping to maintain world peace and avoid the devastation of the local area, and repeatedly telegraphed our representative Shi, requesting the League of Nations to urge him to return to the province. However, the ambitions of the greedy wolf were insatiable. Zhanshan was responsible for defending the territory, so he had no choice but to exercise his national right of self-defense and confront them with arms. At that time, our army was filled with righteous indignation, everyone cherished the determination to die, fought day and night, and the spirit reached the clouds. Finally, due to the inferiority of our military equipment and the daily bombing of the provincial capital and its inhabitants by enemy aircraft, Zhanshan withdrew his troops to the Hailun area in response to the appeals of the people and in deference to the League of Nations' decision. The facts of the past war with the enemy have been announced in successive telegrams, and I trust they have been duly considered. After withdrawing to Hailun, while preparing to replenish our military strength for the final struggle, the Battle of Harbin broke out. Therefore, while sending troops to block and intercept the Japanese army stationed in Jiang Province from attacking Harbin, we also used the main force to assist Ding and Li, planning to connect these two armies and support each other from east and west, so that the enemy's strength might not succeed. Unexpectedly, as soon as our army arrived at Majiachuankou on the north bank of the Songhua River, Ding and Li's troops had already retreated. The Japanese side detected our army's actions to aid Harbin and decided to use heavy troops to attack from Qiqihar and Hailun in an attempt to eliminate our army's strength. At that time, there were strong enemies pressing forward in front, no important passes to defend behind, internal shortages of equipment and ammunition, and external isolation and lack of support. In the face of imminent danger of survival, Zhanshan had been in the army since childhood and had experienced battles. He had long put the words "life and death" out of his mind. He considered that death was either heavier than Mount Tai or lighter than a feather. If we drove an army of loyalty and righteousness to fight against the enemy's sharp and ruthless artillery fire, the result would only be a temporary sacrifice, and the opportunity for recovery would be even more hopeless. After repeated consideration, the only way to solve the current difficulties was to deal with the situation as it arose, slow down the enemy's advance, so that we could preserve our army's existing strength, and then plan a counterattack when the opportunity arose. We could also take the opportunity to investigate the true plans of the Japanese to invade our territory. Therefore, I did not hesitate to risk going to Harbin to meet with Japanese Lieutenant General Domon, adhering to the principle of dealing with him temporarily, so that a glimmer of hope could be preserved in the Northeast. This is the tortuous predicament of Zhanshan in dealing with the Japanese. In international relations, faith and morality are the most important. No one can rely on violence and fraud alone and gain the sympathy of the civilized countries of the world. However, Japan disregarded everything and risked being condemned, and its poisonous plan was beyond imagination. Now that the international investigation team is coming to the East soon, if we do not reveal and announce to the world the various conspiracies of the Japanese that Zhanshan has personally seen and heard for more than forty days, who will know the sinister tricks of the Japanese, and even protect the 30 million people of our three eastern provinces in this hell of no return? On February 16th, in order to understand the truth about the Japanese manufacturing of the puppet government in Manchuria, and also because of the Japanese invitation, Zhanshan risked going to the Liaoning meeting again. The next day, I met with the Japanese Kwantung Army Commander Honjo, who claimed that most of the three eastern provinces had been occupied by the Japanese army, and only a small part of Jilin and Heilongjiang was unlikely to resist. He hoped to cooperate with the Japanese side. That evening, he was forced to attend a meeting at Zhao Xinbo's residence, and all the proposals put forward by Zhanshan to abolish the puppet state were rejected by the Japanese side. On the 18th, he returned to Hailun, feigning illness. Then, according to Zhao Zhongren's report, on the 19th, the Japanese military forcibly forced Zhang Jinghui to establish a preparatory committee for the puppet state, and ordered Zhang Jinghui and Zhao Zhongren to lead twelve representatives of the puppet states of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, who had been bought by the Japanese, to Lushun to urge Puyi to serve as the head of the puppet state. After three rejections, the representatives completed their mission after three requests. March 9th was the date for the establishment of the puppet government. Zhanshan originally intended to make excuses not to go, but in order to avoid suspicion by the Japanese side, he had to go to Changchun. On the 10th, Komai, who is now the Director-General of the General Affairs Office of the Puppet State, and Itagaki, the puppet's senior advisor, held a state affairs meeting in accordance with the military's orders and announced that the puppet government would set up a General Affairs Office to manage all departments and all substantive government affairs. All government orders could not be implemented without the signature and seal of the Office. On the 11th, Itagaki Komai again announced at the state affairs meeting that the Japanese military planned to fill half of the officials of the puppet government and four-tenths of the officials of the puppet provinces and governments with Japanese in the future. It has now been temporarily reduced, and only a hundred or so people have been dispatched to the new government. Then, the issue of Japanese naturalization was discussed. Xi Qia had made a cautious proposal, which was severely reprimanded by Komai Itagaki and others, who said that all Japanese residing in the East Province had been exchanged for with iron and blood, and should naturally belong to the new country's nationality, and there was no need for a cautious trial. As for whether or not to renounce Japanese nationality, the Japanese had the right to weigh it, and others should not interfere. They also announced that general affairs offices and police affairs offices would be set up in Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang provinces, all of which would be filled by Japanese, who would take over full power in the provinces. However, Jiang Province's two general affairs and police affairs offices were temporarily allowed to be filled by the Japanese three months later because Zhanshan strongly opposed it. On the 16th, Honjo came to Jiang to inspect the Dajing position and said that Japan had made up its mind that no matter what sacrifices it made, it would never give up the three eastern provinces. If there were any who opposed the new country, the Japanese army would be fully responsible for sweeping them away, and even if a third country came out to interfere, it would declare war on it. As for government orders, they could be implemented step by step, but they had to be approved by the Japanese military headquarters stationed there. Also, the director of the Harbin Special Affairs Agency, Doihara, and the commander of the Jiang Suzuki Brigade, said that after Japan obtained the three eastern provinces, it had sufficient military materials to invade the Soviet Union in the north and resist the United States in the east. It was all based on this foundation. They also carried out active aggression in land, transportation, finance, and education. The puppet state council decided: (1) All northeastern lands that have already been leased, if the landlords are officials or old warlords, will be confiscated in full; if the number of mu of civilian households is large, half of them will be purchased at the official price; all those that have not been leased will be owned by the puppet state for the use of the Japanese government to carry out immigration (2) The Hulan-Hailun Railway is the hub of grain transportation in Jiang Province, and the Japanese and Zhang Jinghui forcibly mortgaged it at a price of one-tenth, or 3 million yuan. Although the term was set at 50 years, it was tantamount to permanent occupation. Fearing that Zhanshan would not recognize it, he negotiated to supplement the signature, but was sternly rejected. Recently, it has been reported that they have been proceeding to the puppet state's Ministry of Communications (3) Planning to set up the puppet state's Bank of Manchuria, modeled after the Bank of Korea, in order to manipulate finance and suck our fat (4) Destroying our schools and invading our culture. All schools, in addition to stationing troops, will add, delete, and revise our original government-approved textbooks at all levels to incorporate pro-Japanese intentions, so as to eliminate our national character to the best of their ability. They also extremely destroy freedom of speech, even fabricating public opinion and confusing the public, and even massacring our intellectual class. Those who have been educated and have patriotic hearts are assassinated and buried alive, such as the former Minister of Finance Yan Tingyu and Zhang Kuien, director of the Tao Suo Road Bureau, who have all suffered tragic deaths. To sum up the above facts, the Japanese ambition to annex the three eastern provinces and destroy the world peace treaty has been blatantly revealed. Yet, to the international community, they falsely claim that the establishment of the new state of Manchuria is an act of self-determination by the people of the Northeast, but in reality, they are using all means of coercion and threat. The so-called public opinion is purely fabricated by the Japanese. As the saying goes, one hand can cover the ears and eyes of the world. This is what it means. Zhanshan is a mere military man, ashamed of his lack of knowledge, but he bears the heavy responsibility entrusted to him by the country and the earnest entrustment of the people. Therefore, in recent months, he has not hesitated to risk his life, endure humiliation and slander, and deal with the national hatred of not being able to stand with the Han traitors, so that the peasants can rest for a while during the spring plowing season, and then make a big move to achieve full success. Now the Japanese are fabricating [text missing]</p>

<p>The truth about the puppet state has been revealed, and the investigation team is coming to the East soon, taking the opportunity to instigate action, which is exactly the time. Therefore, I secretly distributed the troops in the key points, and came to Heihe urgently on April 7th. All the important personnel of the Heilongjiang military and political offices had been secretly dispatched to Heihe in advance, and the official seals were brought along and started working as usual on the same day, and the recovery plan was being advanced. Although I clearly know that the situation is isolated and weak, and it is difficult to support the building, the enthusiasm for saving the country is earnest, and righteousness does not allow me to look back. With a determination to burn the boat after crossing the river, I have long made a decision. Success will be like Shao Kang's one army, failure will be like Tian Heng's five hundred. As long as there is one breath left, I swear to fight the Japanese to the end. Success or failure does not matter. Alas, the country is not well-built, and disasters arise from strong neighbors. Baishan Songhu are suffering the same calamity. From now on, if I don't behead Loulan, I swear not to return alive. I am afraid that the distress of seeking completeness will not be understood by the people of the country, so I will telegraph the detailed situation of the intermediate process to you. In the past, Zhuang Miao returned to Cao Cao, and his ambition was in the Han Dynasty. Zifang assisted Liu, and his heart was eager to preserve Han. Zhanshan is mediocre and ignorant, and secretly admires it. Know me, blame me, only in the gentlemen of the country. With a sad and indignant telegram, I don't know what to say. Chairman Ma Zhanshan of Heilongjiang Province respectfully bows, printed text.</p>
<p>Ma Zhanshan telegraphed Li Du from Heihe on the 12th: "To Li Zhenshoushi and Brother Zhi Chu, I left Qiqihar early in the winter to visit the stationed troops in Baikenner and other counties, and arrived safely in Heihe late in the Yang evening. All the troops under my command have now been deployed. I feel uncomfortable due to a cold on the way, and I plan to recuperate here and will not return to the province for the time being. Please let me know what the situation is like in your place."</p>
<h3 id="e4">LEAGUE OF NATIONS SPECIAL COMMITTEE MEETING <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>▲ To Be Held on the 16th</p>
<p>▲ Advice to China is Unconfirmed</p>
<p>Reuters Geneva dispatch on the 13th: After the news that Foreign Minister Simon, President of the League of Nations General Assembly, will arrive here tomorrow in order to hold a meeting of the League of Nations' 19-nation special committee, the general public once again focused their attention on the situation in the Far East. The rumor that the League of Nations General Assembly seemed about to rashly declare Japan an aggressor and intend to implement the sanctions stipulated in Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant has not yet been confirmed by official sources. Judging from the situation, at least a portion of the 19-nation special committee still believes that on-the-spot negotiations and the elimination of severe points will increase the hope of a compromise. If the wrangling over Gu Weijun's joining the League of Nations investigation team into Manchuria as a Chinese attendant is not resolved quickly, the Manchurian incident will dazzle the eyes of the public again. As for the claim that the League of Nations Secretariat has asked the Chinese delegation to advise the Chinese government to continue negotiations in Shanghai, the Secretariat has not said a word about it. However, this matter has been handled by the 19-nation special committee, which is expected to meet on Saturday. If the Secretariat takes the rumored approach, it would be unusual. Perhaps two or three great powers have informally advised the Chinese delegation, which is also within expectations. Reuters Nanjing dispatch on the 13th: The Chinese government spokesman met with a Reuters reporter this afternoon and firmly denied the claim from Tokyo that the League of Nations had advised China to continue peace talks with Japan in Shanghai and not to petition the League of Nations. It was said that neither the Chinese government nor the Chinese delegation in Geneva had received this advice. The Chinese government has just learned that the League of Nations' 19-nation special committee will meet on Saturday morning, April 16, to discuss China's application and plan a proper method for implementing the League of Nations General Assembly's resolution. Reuters Tokyo dispatch on the 13th: According to sources in charge here, the League of Nations Secretariat has responded to China's move to report the entire Shanghai ceasefire negotiations to the League of Nations, advising the Chinese delegation to continue negotiations in Shanghai and not to petition the League of Nations immediately.</p>

<p>The Sino-Japanese armistice and troop withdrawal conference has come to a standstill. Various people's groups in this city have also expressed their opposition to the compromise measures proposed by the British Minister. Yesterday, they sent a telegram to the League of Nations, which reads: "To Dr. Yan, the Chinese representative in Geneva, for transmission to the Special Committee of the League of Nations: The Shanghai Sino-Japanese armistice and troop withdrawal conference has been held many times, but the Japanese have no sincerity in complying with the resolutions of the League of Nations. They resolutely demand the indefinite stationing of troops in vast areas such as Wusong. The compromise measures proposed by the British Minister do not conform to the meaning of troop withdrawal. The three million people of Shanghai, in order to respect the resolutions of the League of Nations, unanimously oppose them. We earnestly hope that your committee will exercise the powers conferred upon it by the General Assembly and concretely stipulate the measures for the withdrawal of troops from Shanghai."</p>

<p>▲ Openly Declaring to Monitor the Chinese Army</p>
<p>A Teletype dispatch from Tokyo on the 13th reports: "The armistice conference has fallen into a prolonged stalemate. The Japanese military authorities, in view of the mission of the dispatched troops, are now adopting the same firm will as when the general offensive began on February 20, and are taking a tough stance of strictly monitoring the Chinese army. In this state, all measures such as the organization of troops for long-term garrisoning, the securing of equipment for the garrison line, etc., will be decided by Commander Shirakawa of the Shanghai Expeditionary Force. Therefore, the Japanese army will extend further west than the Japanese army's withdrawal line at the armistice conference, and will build semi-permanent fortifications in the current area, and will also plan the necessary facilities for long-term garrisoning, as well as military and economic plans."</p>

<p>Recover Lost Territory by Force</p>
<p>Repel the Enemy with Hot Blood</p>
<p>A Talk by Zhao Yijian The Battlefield News Agency reports: "Because the front line situation is quiet and there is nothing special to record, the reporter went to the headquarters and interviewed Chief of Staff Zhao Yijian to ask for his opinion on the current situation. Chief of Staff Zhao did not hesitate and spoke eloquently. The following is a slightly整理 arrangement of his conversation: Since our country accepted the resolution of the League of Nations on March 4, a formal armistice conference was held at the British Consulate in Shanghai on March 19. More than 20 days have passed since then, and more than ten meetings have been held, but there has been no obvious progress. The Japanese side has always made excuses and cunningly delayed. Except for a few insignificant conditions, they have expressed their willingness to comply, but they have always refused to clearly announce the most important date for the withdrawal of troops. Their ulterior motives are evident. In this foggy situation, the government is at a loss above, the people are resentful below, and the generals and soldiers on the front line scratch their heads, beat their thighs, and sigh with emotion. Diplomats have their own vision and skills in bargaining for gains and losses. We are not in their position and should not rush to criticize them. However, according to common sense, there are only two ways: peace and war. To put it bluntly, seeking a peaceful and just solution within the scope of not losing rights and humiliating the country is what we would like to hear. Otherwise, we can only recover lost territory by force to ensure the integrity of national territory and sovereignty. There is no hesitation. I have heard the advocates of peace say that King Goujian of Yue was a subject of Wu, and as a result of ten years of recuperation and ten years of training, he finally destroyed the entire Wu. Napoleon trampled on Germany, but William and Bismarck worked hard to strengthen themselves, and in the Franco-Prussian War, Germany took the lead in Europe. For example, in the 18th year of the Republic, the authorities of our country made concessions in the Jinan case and were able to unify the whole country. So why can't the Shanghai case be imitated? This kind of fallacy is called self-consolation, but it is actually self-deception. When the country is in danger, it endures humiliation, bears the burden, and teaches war, and is finally able to avenge its humiliation and revive the country. There is indeed such a thing, but the times have changed and the environment has changed. We cannot talk about it on the same day. Our country today has the necessity of fighting, and has the certainty of victory in the war against Japan. If we abandon it, and say that we should endure humiliation and wait for victory in the future, then what is the meaning of the war since January 28, which has killed tens of thousands of lives and lost 150 million yuan? Since the Opium War, all humiliating treaties in our country can be washed away by the word "endure humiliation" and return to beauty. Why is it necessary to fight against Japan? Today's talk of saving the country often says to unite, but as a result of the twenty years of civil war in our country, all the generals and soldiers in the country are divided, entering and leaving as slaves, only knowing how to be the claws of the main general and the tools of competition. If they can be placed on the battlefield and target the enemy country, they will surely change their thinking and die for the country. The dynasties and fields of our country are established separately. Even in the same party, the words of the leaders have not been aligned. This is an undeniable fact. However, only in the war against Japan, they coincide without consultation. Evidence can be seen in the declaration of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang in Luoyang, the past speeches and telegrams of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, President Wang Jingwei, and President Sun Ke, and the various Central Committee members in Shanghai, all of whom are full of righteous indignation. As for the national newspapers and public opinion, they are even more clearly opposed to compromising for peace. If we can quickly make a decision to recover lost territory by force, we will surely be able to shift the national focus and gather the spirit of internal struggle to rush to the national crisis. If we devote all our efforts to resist Japan, and fight to the death, the people can still understand each other. If we hesitate on the path of peace talks and delay the country, then even if we sing loudly for unity, what will be the use? This is one point. Our country has a vast territory and the people are ignorant. We have tried our best to publicize the brutality of imperialism, but the impression of the people in the interior is still vague. Without the opportunity of foreign war to give them a strong stimulus, it is not enough to excite this ancient nation. And without obtaining victory in foreign war, it is not enough to restore the nation's self-confidence. This is the second point. Since Japan invaded the eastern provinces, it has been constantly provoking in Tianjin, Qingdao, Fuzhou, and Shantou, trying to shift international attention. This time, delaying the Shanghai case is also the same trick. We must know that the eastern provinces issue is the root, and the Shanghai issue is the end. If we want to solve the eastern provinces issue as soon as possible, we must immediately recover Shanghai and make the international community focus on the issue of the three northeastern provinces for discussion. This is the third point. According to the provisions of Article 10 of the Covenant of the League of Nations and Article 1 of the Nine-Power Treaty, all contracting states shall respect the independence of China's sovereignty and the territorial and administrative integrity. The resolution of the League of Nations on March 4 also takes the withdrawal of Japanese troops as a condition for seeking peace. Today, the other side has overthrown it one by one. In order to uphold the above treaties and resolutions, we should immediately recover lost territory. This is the fourth point. Moreover, our country has been in civil war for years, and the number of troops has increased to millions. The proposal for troop reduction has just been initiated, and the beginning of civil war has been opened again, resulting in the inability to reduce troops, the inability to reorganize finances, the depletion of the economy, the urgency of war, and the inability to talk about political construction. The mountains and rivers are boiling with public grievances. Even if the Duke of Zhou and Tang Wu were to govern, they would be at a loss. If we drive these millions of sick people and trouble-making troops to fight to the death with the violent Japanese, we can alleviate the national crisis and pacify the people's grievances. This is the fifth point. Why can we say that we have the certainty of victory in the war against Japan? Here is an explanation, that is, the so-called victory is not the victory at the moment. This time, the violence of the Japanese is rampant, and the world is watching. At the Shanghai Armistice Conference, the ministers of various countries are involved, and the right and wrong have long been known to the world. Although we do not seek pity from others, nor rely on the aid of others, it is inevitable that those who gain the Dao will have more help, and those who lose the Dao will have little help. The failure of the violence of the Japanese can be seen from this. This is one point. In recent years, the phenomenon of economic recession in the world has become increasingly serious. Countries are trying to restore their economies, striving to seize the market, and maintain order in the middle market. China today has become the only market in the world. How can countries sit idly by and watch the violence of the Japanese wantonly destroy it, and how can they allow the violence of the Japanese to occupy it arbitrarily? Therefore, the extension of the Sino-Japanese war, for the sake of their own interests, will naturally lead to the evolution of countries rising up to sanction the violence of the Japanese. This is the second point. The violence of the Japanese is an industrial country. The extension of the war will inevitably lead to the decline of industry and commerce, the unemployment of the masses, and social revolution will occur and collapse. This is the third point. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the violence of the Japanese's foreign trade has been declining, and the economy has been falling into distress. Although they have raised public bonds, the country's financial resources are exhausted, and foreign countries have refused to apply. It will be difficult to continue the long-term war. This is the fourth point. Although our country's conscription system is not perfect, the conscripted soldiers are generally free from family burdens. Once trained, they will die for the country and will not leave. The result of the Japanese side's conscription has affected various industries in the country (such as tram workers, who went on strike due to conscription), and many are inevitably concerned about their families. This can be seen from the talks of Japanese prisoners. Therefore, although their weapons are sharp, they are ultimately not as good as the spirit of our army who regard death as home. This is the fifth point. In short, our country is now in a critical moment of life and death, and we must not cling to the dream of temporary peace. We should make a great determination to resist the violence of the Japanese for a long time. Our country's past failures were all mistaken by the thought of temporary peace. If the Shanghai case can be ended hastily, then why can't the four northeastern provinces be simply given away? In the future, why can't the twenty provinces in the southeast, northwest, and other places be given to others? Su Shi said that the destruction of the six countries was not due to the unfavorable weapons or the poor fighting, but to the bribery of Qin. There has never been a fact in history that temporary peace and begging for peace can save the country. Turkey's resistance to Greece had no sufficient military force at first. The key to its success was the awakening of the people and the smoothness of diplomacy. Today, the Chinese people have the determination to resist Japan to the death, and various countries have expressed sympathy for our country. With this opportunity, if we cannot emulate Turkey's efforts to strengthen ourselves, and if another fact is added to the history of national humiliation, then it is also very sad.</p>
<p>Shen Guanghan's Admonition The Shanghai Armistice Conference is about to break down due to the Japanese side's lack of sincerity. The Second Great bloodshed cannot be avoided. Our frontline generals and soldiers are all invigorated and eager to show off their skills again. Commander Shen Guanghan has been gathering his officers and soldiers to speak at 囗囗 for days, saying: The violence of the Japanese is making all kinds of difficulties, and we can never make them withdraw through verbal concessions. We should prepare to repel the enemy with blood, and sacrifice to the end with the consistent spirit of sacrificing ourselves to save the country. His words are extremely tragic, and all the officers and soldiers are filled with anger and indignation, vowing to fight the Japanese invaders to the last.</p>

<h3 id="e10">Annual Meeting of Foreign Taxpayers in the Public Concession Held Yesterday <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Passing of 1931 Accounts</p>
<p>Approval of the 1932 New Budget</p>
<p>Increase of Two Chinese Property Committee Members</p>
<p>The annual meeting of foreign taxpayers in the Public Concession was held at the Carlton Theatre yesterday at 2:30 PM. The meeting was convened following a notice from the Consular Body, with the police force making advance plans for traffic routes and parking locations near the venue to avoid congestion.  After 2:00 PM yesterday, foreign taxpayers arrived one after another, with a constant flow of vehicles and horses. The police force also dispatched additional Western officers and detectives to the scene to maintain order. By 2:30 PM, a large number of taxpayers had arrived, and the meeting was declared open. Mr. Baker was publicly elected as chairman, followed by the election of a secretary. After the meeting rules were approved as usual, the agenda was discussed, with details as follows:</p>
<p>Item 4: In his speech on Item 4, the Chairman of the Board said, "In my capacity as the retiring Chairman of the Board, I propose the fourth resolution, which is to pass the report on the accounts for 1931. The annual report for this year is quite lengthy, and part of it has already appeared in the newspapers, so I will not go into further detail here.  However, Shanghai has recently gone through a period of crisis. Fortunately, the defense forces of various countries, the merchant corps, and the special police came forward to maintain order, and many residents of the concession also assisted in a personal capacity.  I must express the sincere thanks of the Municipal Council on their behalf. The diligence of the council's staff is also commendable. The financial report for 1931 has already been distributed and does not need to be elaborated on.  The ordinary budget actually had a surplus of more than 350,000 taels, which was unexpected. This was due to strenuous efforts to tighten spending and the improvement in silver prices, as well as the allocation of funds between the ordinary and temporary budgets.  The temporary budget had a deficit of more than 510,000 taels. The temporary expenditures for this year included the repayment of the 1921 Eight Percent Loan, as well as the purchase of land for parks costing 800,000 taels, and the widening and extension of roads costing 2.7 million taels.  Most of these temporary expenses were paid for with the proceeds from the sale of the Electricity Department. Regarding the</p>
<p>Political Situation: The Public Concession has recently experienced a severe crisis unprecedented in its history. The full impact and causal relationships are not yet clear. During and after the war, the Board of Directors, in view of the international nature of the concession, made every effort to maintain neutrality and impartiality, while simultaneously maintaining its administrative authority. This was not easy at a time when the emotions of most citizens were running high. The Municipal Council had to uphold everything from a legal standpoint. At that time, some people advocated that the Council should take extraordinary measures, which the Council could not satisfy, and therefore was inevitably subject to criticism.  The Municipal Council had to maintain its administration and avoid falling into traps, so it had to pay close attention to everything every day, and also had to take into account national sentiments at all times to avoid causing incidents due to suppression.  Fortunately, the Council did not offend the feelings of the Chinese and Japanese residents during this period, which is something that the retiring Board of Directors can be gratified about. The responsibilities of the new Board of Directors are extremely heavy, and finance is one of the major challenges.  The Council's finances have always been a difficult issue. Now, after the chaos, commerce and industry have suffered huge losses, so the difficulties will naturally be even greater. However, the Public Concession has gone through several difficult times and has always recovered quickly, so there is reason to be optimistic about the future. However, the restoration of the original state may take longer. The financial problem is only one of the problems. Shanghai is at the forefront of Sino-foreign relations, and there is a (Shanghai problem).  There are many inconsistencies in the administrative system of this city, and after this chaos, several weaknesses have been exposed.  Whenever there is an international conflict, Shanghai is subject to various dangers. Therefore, the relevant powers must immediately pay close attention to the current and future political status of Shanghai. The Municipal Council has no power to direct the path to be taken regarding the future status of Shanghai. However, I believe that future international conferences will discuss this issue, and they will inevitably have to discuss it. The Municipal Council will then have the opportunity to fully contribute its opinions based on its experience and knowledge, in order to be adopted as much as possible. The permanent solution to the Shanghai problem must also take into account the interests of both Chinese and foreigners. This is also a fact that must be fully acknowledged.  The new Board of Directors will do its best to achieve this goal, which the taxpayers can rest assured of. Regarding the Shanghai</p>

<p>Special District Court: At last year's annual meeting, regarding the</p>
<p>Special District Court's criminal section, I said that apart from the Nanjing government's attempts to interfere in communist cases, there was not much that could be criticized about the Municipal Council's handling of criminal cases in the Special District Court. This situation has not changed much. However, since mid-September, when the boycott of Japanese goods began, cases involving Japanese goods and anti-Japanese issues have become lawless.  In addition to a large number of propaganda materials and inspections, Chinese goods labeled as Japanese goods, worth more than 600,000 yuan, were forcibly seized, and a large part of them were sold. The proceeds were also disposed of without authorization.  Several Chinese businessmen labeled as traitors were illegally arrested and detained in the Tianhou Temple and other places. All kinds of acts were carried out as if laws and regulations did not exist. The Special District Court, either due to a misguided sense of patriotism or out of fear of violence, simply turned a blind eye to everything, making it impossible for the Municipal Council to deal with these incidents.  This attitude of the Special District Court was undoubtedly one of the causes of the Sino-Japanese war in Zhabei.  In this emergency situation, the Special District Court was negligent, which has fundamentally shaken, although not completely destroyed, the hope of foreign residents that the Chinese government could establish a court within the Public Concession that foreigners could trust.  The current Special District Court is based on an agreement between the Chinese government and certain countries, starting on April 1, 1930, for a period of three years. If both parties agree, the term can be extended. This negotiation was conducted in secret at the time, but the Municipal Council's representatives were hastily consulted on certain points.  Apart from this, the Municipal Council and foreign residents were completely unaware of the content until it became a *fait accompli*, which caused great resentment among the public. The reason why the negotiation was so secret and hasty at the time has not been officially announced, but given the political situation at the time, the relevant powers probably believed that it was better to have an agreement, no matter how unsatisfactory, than to have no agreement at all.  Foreign businessmen are very dissatisfied with the civil aspects of the court, as can be seen from the annual speech of the president of the Harmony Business Association a month ago. Previously, the Municipal Council was not very concerned about civil cases in the court, but in light of recent events, it is also questionable how the court will legally enforce the municipal rates.  Normally, negotiations should be started as soon as possible regarding the continuation of the court agreement or the revision of a more satisfactory new agreement.  With the current dissatisfaction rising from all sides, and the new directors having declared that they will do their best to find a solution to this problem, it is hoped that a definite achievement can be made within a reasonable period of time. As far as foreign public opinion is concerned, the most satisfactory solution would be to establish an international court within the concession, applying uniform civil and criminal laws to all residents, regardless of nationality.  There is almost unanimous agreement with this view, but in fact, we must completely leave these issues to the disposal of the relevant governments.  Unless we obtain their sympathy and support, we cannot achieve anything in reforming or improving the local Chinese court.  The practical difficulties in seeking a satisfactory solution to this matter are undoubtedly extremely significant, but not impossible.  It is hoped that the new Board of Directors will devote themselves to this and achieve considerable success.  Although the Chinese directors do not participate in my comments on the Special District Court, in the past year, the Chinese directors have assisted the Board of Directors in resolving many difficult issues, especially in the past few months.  Their service to the concession has been extraordinarily valuable, which I am happy to commend.</p>
<p>Educational Affairs: Last year, I reported that 150,000 taels had been allocated to subsidize non-council schools.  The detailed regulations have been drafted and announced, and it has been decided to subsidize foreign children's schools by 45% and Chinese children's schools by 55%.  The former has already been allocated and will be issued soon. The latter cannot be allocated at the same time because the agreement with the Shanghai Municipal Education Authority</p>
<p>has not yet been reached. However, there has been progress in this agreement recently, and it is hoped that it can be handled simultaneously in 1932.  Last year, it was reported that the Council had approved an education plan to add two Chinese children's primary schools every year before 1938, and two Chinese girls' middle schools before 1934. However, due to difficulties in buying land and economic reasons, the first year's program could not be fully implemented, or it may have to be slowed down in the future.  Zizi Middle School and Primary School have rented buildings and opened one school each, and two existing primary schools are under construction. A foreign children's school has also been started construction.</p>
<p>Factory Regulations: In December 1929, the Nanjing government promulgated a Factory Law, which was later scheduled to take effect on August 1 of last year. This law is very broad in scope, and all economic and social aspects are worth discussing.  From the perspective of the history of factory regulations, the current law is difficult to implement in China's current situation. At most, it can only be implemented slowly and gradually in order to suit China's economic and social progress.  However, if part of this law can be implemented within the concession, Chinese and foreign factory owners will be very welcome, which can improve the conditions of workers in the concession.  The conditions in certain factories are almost unspeakable.  Also, if it is implemented, it is best to treat Chinese and foreign factories equally. However, foreign factory owners who enjoy consular jurisdiction are not bound by the Chinese Factory Law, and the factory laws of countries that have consular jurisdiction treaties with China have never been applied to their overseas Chinese citizens. Therefore, if the Municipal Council wants to exercise jurisdiction over factories in the concession, it must amend By-law 34 so that factories can be licensed, and the licensing regulations can include various rules deemed suitable for implementation in the Chinese government's Factory Law. However, amending the by-laws requires convening a special taxpayers' meeting, and one-third of the total number must be present. The Board of Directors originally intended to convene this special meeting before the annual meeting, but in view of the recent industrial situation and the closure of factories, with many workers losing their jobs as a result, it was decided to convene it when the situation is better. However, the Board of Directors will not shelve this matter, which taxpayers and the public can rest assured of. I now propose the fourth motion, which is to pass the annual report and final accounts for the year ending December 31, 1931.  This motion was seconded by Mr. Bell, and the chairman put it to a vote, which was unanimously approved by the meeting.</p>
<p>Item 5: In his speech on Item 5, the Chairman of the Board said, "Before presenting the budget, there are several points to be explained. First, the ordinary budget and the education budget have now been separated. The ordinary expenses for education are roughly the same as last year, and the amount currently used for foreign children and Chinese children is also roughly the same.  However, if the plan approved last year is carried out, the expenses for Chinese children's education should increase in the future. The current ordinary expenses for education are more than 1.38 million taels, which is about 1.74 percent of the municipal rates and land tax. Whether a certain amount of municipal revenue should be designated for this expense should be seriously considered.  The explanation attached to the budget compares the figures for 1932 with those for 1931. Due to austerity and the recovery of the pound, it has been possible to keep the expenses of various departments roughly the same as last year. The Municipal Council is not a static organization, and its various functions are becoming increasingly complex. In the midst of the global commercial recession, it is not easy to maintain efficient administration with the same level of spending as last year. As for the revenue side, last year there was a surplus of about 2.3 million taels from the previous year, so the 1931 budget was balanced. This year, however, there is only a surplus of 350,000 taels from last year, and interest income has decreased significantly due to the gradual allocation of the proceeds from the sale of the Electricity Department. The ordinary budget for this year showed a shortfall of about 2.5 million taels from the outset. Normally, taxes should be increased</p>
<h2>Page 6</h2>
<p>to compensate. However, for various reasons, the plan to increase taxes had to be postponed, and other methods were adopted. After careful deliberation, there is still a shortage of about 1.25 million taels. It has recently been decided to sell some of the Council's surplus land. In addition to returning the original value to the temporary budget, the remaining balance will be transferred to the ordinary budget. However, although this measure is sound in principle, it is not sustainable in the long run. Therefore, an increase in taxes will be unavoidable in the near future. The temporary budget is estimated at more than 18.9 million taels, of which about 10 million taels are for debt repayment, and the remaining uses are also unavoidable.  On the income side, in addition to allocating 16 million taels from the proceeds of the power company and about 1.5 million taels from the sale of land, it is still necessary to raise debt or raise funds by other means, not exceeding 2 million taels. In this way, about 88,000 taels can be left over at the end of the year to be carried over to the next year.  I now propose the fifth motion, which is (to approve and adopt the expenditure for the year 1932 proposed by the current Board of Directors and the attached recommendations, and to authorize the Municipal Council to levy and collect the proposed taxes and fees, and to authorize it to raise no more than 2 million taels by appropriate means to meet the needs of the temporary budget).  This motion was seconded by Mr. Bell, and the chairman put it to a vote, which was unanimously approved by the meeting.</p>
<p>Item 6: In his speech on Item 6, the Chairman of the Board said, "Regarding the issue of Chinese property committee members, last year, the Chinese directors and various Chinese organizations requested the Municipal Council to find a way to add two Chinese property committee members to the existing committee of three foreign members. The request was very urgent.  A large part of the land in the concession is owned by Chinese, so the Municipal Council considers this request reasonable and feels that there should be no major opposition from foreign taxpayers.  However, this matter requires amending the property regulations, and as usual, a special meeting of taxpayers should be convened.  However, judging from past experience, it is difficult to obtain the legal quorum of one-third of the taxpayers except for extremely important events.  However, there is another way to amend the property regulations.  Taxpayers can authorize the annual meeting and order the Municipal Council to submit this matter to the relevant countries. If they adopt it, it can also be amended, just like the resolution of a special meeting.  I now propose the sixth motion, which is (This meeting believes that it is appropriate to add two Chinese property committee members. The Board of Directors is hereby authorized to propose to the relevant countries to add two Chinese members to the Land Committee.) This motion was seconded by Mr. Bell, and the chairman put it to a vote, which was unanimously approved by the meeting. Mr. Baker was also elected as a land committee member.</p>
<h3 id="e11">Important Declaration Issued by the Citizens' Federation and Other Organizations <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Advocating Mutual Assistance and Cooperation Between Chinese and Western Taxpayers</p>
<p>Studying and Resolving the Joint Defense of the Concession in the Future</p>
<p>The Citizens' Federation, the United Federation of Commercial Circles, various branch associations, and the guilds of transportation, customs declaration, copper and iron, machinery, woolen mills, antique shops, embroidery, and other industries, as well as the United Federation of Ten-Person Patriotic Groups, and more than 100 other organizations, issued a declaration yesterday stating that, "The history of Shanghai in 1932, before today, already has countless pages of tragic records. These tragic records not only cause direct or indirect harm and suffering to the Chinese and Western taxpayers in Shanghai today, but also make the Municipal Council, which manages Shanghai's municipal administration, a victim of these tragic records. The prosperous market of the concession for the past 88 years has also suffered a great catastrophe. The Shanghai Chinese Taxpayers' Association has accepted the commission under the entrustment of our Chinese taxpayers' vote yesterday, but has taken on the responsibility of creating the future history of Shanghai.  Although we have no way to eliminate the tragic records before today, we must use a legal and reasonable spirit to fight for the maintenance and revival of the damaged and suffering Chinese and Western taxpayers, the victimized Municipal Council, and the Shanghai prosperous market that has suffered a great catastrophe. Therefore, we must find a path of struggle in the lessons of the past. No one can deny that the makers of all the recent tragic records are the Japanese soldiers who pursue Japan's policy towards China. In order to complete their policy towards China, they do not hesitate to sacrifice the Shanghai prosperous market created by the blood and sweat of Chinese and Western taxpayers in Shanghai for 88 years, disregard the suffering of the Chinese and Western taxpayers in Shanghai today, and the status of the Municipal Council that manages the municipal administration, and resolutely destroy the Shanghai prosperous market jointly owned by Chinese and Western taxpayers. Everyone knows that the Japanese soldiers in Shanghai before January 28 were members of the Concession Defense Force Committee and were entrusted by the Municipal Council to be responsible for maintaining the security of the concession. The current facts tell us that this Japanese committee member, who is responsible for maintaining the security of the concession, not only abandoned his responsibility, but also personally destroyed the security. Here, we cannot but blame the previous Board of Directors of the Municipal Council. They failed the Chinese and Western taxpayers and made a mistake in their entrustment. Do we really want to blame the previous Board of Directors? We know that they had no malicious intent when entrusting them. We do not see the subsequent struggles of Major General MacNaghten, the previous Chairman of the Board. Although various struggles did not have an effect in the past, we should admit that they have fulfilled their considerable responsibility in a calm and peaceful manner. The previous Board of Directors has transferred the unfinished responsibility to the current Board of Directors. We must directly urge the Chinese directors and indirectly urge the Western directors to take on the responsibility in order to maintain and revive the Shanghai prosperity that is already in danger. On the other hand, in light of the past lessons, we should directly awaken the Chinese taxpayers and indirectly awaken the Western taxpayers to do their best to assist the Board of Directors and support the Municipal Council owned by the Chinese and Western taxpayers, because the Chinese and Western taxpayers are the masters of the concession today. The Chinese and Western taxpayers also cannot but bear the responsibility for the unprecedented catastrophe that the concession has suffered in the past. Therefore, not only should the Board of Directors be responsible for the future maintenance and revival of Shanghai's prosperity, which is already in danger, the representative assembly of the Chinese Taxpayers' Association should also be responsible, and all Chinese and Western taxpayers living within the scope of the concession should also be jointly responsible. Looking at the past facts, we know that the protagonist of the tragedy that destroyed the prosperity was the Japanese soldier who acted on Japan's policy towards China, but who invited this protagonist to perform, and who witnessed this protagonist leaving the dignity of the rule of law, the principle of mutual assistance and cooperation, and the security maintenance program, and performing a tragedy that Chinese and Western taxpayers did not want to see or like, and was unable to stop it? In these two questions, we can give an answer, which is the organizational law of the Defense Force Committee left over from the past history. The Shanghai Consular Investigation Team said that the chairman of the Defense Force Committee has no right to direct the committee members, and President Fessenden said that the Municipal Council has no right to interfere with the Defense Force Committee. They are all bound by the organizational law of the Defense Force Committee left over from the past. May I ask whether this kind of restraint should be liberated, whether this kind of organizational law can still be applied now, and whether it can continue to be used after the facts prove that it is not applicable? All Chinese and Western taxpayers who agree that the spirit of the rule of law is the basis for the administration of the Municipal Council, and who recognize that mutual assistance and cooperation between China and the West is sufficient to develop Shanghai's prosperity, must feel that the organizational law of the Defense Force Committee, which is not applicable, does need to be amended, and that the Defense Force Committee members who violate the wishes of the Chinese and Western taxpayers, plunder the political power of the Municipal Council, infringe on the rights of the Chinese and Western taxpayers, and destroy Shanghai's prosperity, need to be deprived of their future right of joint defense. For the sake of Shanghai's prosperity and the common happiness of the Chinese and Western taxpayers, standing on the position of the taxpayers, we advocate amending the organizational law of the Defense Force Committee and depriving the Japanese army of the right of joint defense in the future. Under this proposition, we have decided to do our best to struggle, choose a legal and reasonable way to meet the needs of maintaining and reviving the Shanghai prosperity that is already in danger. We hope that the representative assembly that accepts our commission will earnestly fulfill their responsibilities, and we also hope that all taxpayers in today's assembly, as well as fair Japanese taxpayers, will express warm sympathy for our proposition, and also rise up to organize a representative assembly to study the organizational law of the Defense Force Committee in the future and solve the joint defense problems in the concession in the future.</p>

<p>A telegram from Luoyang reads: "The Shanghai Municipal Government and its subordinate groups, masses, and volunteer armies are aware that our soldiers in Songhu have been fighting bitterly for more than a month to defend the sovereignty of our territory. The spirit of sacrifice has shocked the world, and the material and spiritual assistance of our compatriots from all walks of life in Shanghai, whether it be resources or donations, is even more sufficient to express the national will, so that the strong neighbor knows that our people cannot be insulted, our country cannot be insulted, and our country cannot be destroyed. The restoration of Yanwei depends on this.  At the moment of great sorrow and deep pain, the comrades raise the idea of ​​compatriots' patriotic enthusiasm, which is more admirable. Hereby, we send a telegram of condolences and hope to continue to work hard to win the final victory.  Wang Xiaolai, Gao Yihan, Liu Hengjing, Tong Guanxian, Zang Qifang, and all members of the Presidium of the National Crisis Conference bow together. Seal."</p>

The Russian emigrants are allowed to live here in this country during their difficult times, so the Federation is deeply saddened by activities disloyal to China, and even more condemned in the current environment.

<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4 p.m., the Jiangsu Flood Relief Association held its sixth regular meeting in the back hall of the Renji Hall on Six Malu. Commissioners Wang Yiting, Huang Hanzhi, Du Yuesheng, Cheng Xiangqing, Wu Yunzhai, Lu Shaoliu, Gu Xinyi, and over ten others attended. Chairman Yiting reported that due to the impact of the current situation, the regular meeting could not be held for two months. All emergency winter relief efforts are coming to an end, and we should discuss how to plan the association's affairs from now on. Commissioner Cheng Xiangqing reported on the emergency winter relief situation, as well as the income and expenditure of relief funds. The committee received 82,000 yuan allocated from the Relief Committee, 338,000 yuan allocated from the Provincial Relief Committee, 364,740 yuan from the Shanghai fundraising for provincial flood emergency relief committee, and 476,566 yuan and 87 cents donated by various charitable organizations and philanthropists, plus 5,019 yuan and 5 cents in interest from various banks, totaling 1,266,325 yuan and 92 cents in ocean silver. A total of 1,194,176 yuan and 22 cents was allocated to various counties for emergency winter relief and to prepare relief grain and clothing. A subsidy of 10,600 yuan was allocated to the Shanghai shelter and the war zone refugee relief committee, 15,216 yuan and 72 cents for transportation, advertising, and the purchase of supplies, 23,399 yuan and 50 cents for the expenses of various county investigation and release bureaus, and 9,706 yuan and 66 cents for the association's expenses and compensation, totaling 1,253,099 yuan and 10 cents. Commissioner Cheng proposed that the association has done its best in emergency winter relief. With the approaching spring famine, relief is even more urgent. In addition, many refugees have returned from the war zone. Gao Bao, Xingtai, Dongtai, and other counties are full of refugees. These people are both hungry and homeless, and they have nowhere to escape. The miserable situation is beyond words. He has witnessed it with his own eyes and feels deeply distressed. He knows that it is difficult to raise funds in the current national crisis. It is beyond our ability to talk about spring relief. Can we raise a small amount of relief funds and do some work relief in an impossible situation, in order to make up for it in the event of an emergency? (Public Resolution) In the current national crisis, there is really no way to raise funds. We will send telegrams to various investigation and release bureaus to urge them to submit their relief sales and end the association's affairs as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The *Great American Evening News* reported that the case of American Crowley being accused of smuggling opium to the United States was heard again yesterday (12th) afternoon by the US court. Mick Henry, an officer from the US transport ship *Garland*, testified. The prosecutor then summoned Gu Ziman, a waiter in the transport ship's galley at the time, who testified that on September 12th, he took a piece of paper and gave it to Mick Henry. Mick Henry then used it to wrap a package and told him to place it on the transport ship's freight car parked next to the pier. This morning (13th), the US court continued the hearing. First, the defendant's lawyer cross-examined Gu Ziman, and then summoned Anderly, a sea gate guard at the transport ship dock at the Mason Fort in San Francisco, who testified that that morning, he was sitting on the transport ship's freight car and saw a Filipino wearing a white chef's vest put a package on the car. The Filipino greeted him and hurried back to the transport ship. He waited for a long time in the car, but the owner of the item did not come, so he became suspicious and opened the package to see that there was a bottle of whiskey and eleven small packages, each packaged with five tin cans. He poked a can with a small knife, and it was filled with black material. He smelled it and there was no different smell. He tasted it and it tasted bitter.

<h3 id="e21">Latest News on the *Shishi Xinbao* Labor Dispute <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>General Meeting of *Shishi Xinbao* Employees</p>
<p>Various Industry Unions Issue Declarations</p>
<p>The newspaper industry union issued a message saying that the *Shishi Xinbao* labor dispute has become increasingly extreme because the management has not shown sincerity so far, and the union's employees are even more激昂. The latest news from various parties yesterday is recorded below:</p>
<p>General Meeting of *Shishi Xinbao* Employees: Yesterday, all the employees of *Shishi Xinbao* automatically convened a general meeting of employees, because they realized that the *Shishi Xinbao* management not only refused the goodwill mediation of all parties, but also insisted on going its own way, ignoring justice, and applying the cruel means of unreasonably favoring the staff of the newspaper to the workers of the newspaper. More than one hundred people attended the meeting, chaired by Shen Tingrong and recorded by Chen Jinquan. The situation of yesterday's general meeting is briefly recorded below:</p>
<p>Report Items: The chairman reported the purpose of the meeting, followed by Zhang Baokang's detailed report on the course of events, and then by the reports of the special commissioners on the negotiations and support from various parties in the past ten days. The words were extremely painful, and the masses were quite excited. The entire venue was maintained by the discipline inspection committee, and the order was well maintained.</p>
<p>Motions of the General Meeting: (1) Request the union to severely punish the labor traitors (passed). (2) Resolve to resist the *Shishi Xinbao* capitalists to the end and never yield (passed). (3) Warn the blindly following employees (passed). (4) According to the orders of the National Government and the announcement of the Social Bureau, during the national crisis, the work of employees should not be arbitrarily stopped, and the Social Bureau should be asked to discuss appropriate measures (passed).</p>
<p>Declaration of the Pudong Industry Unions: The Pudong Industry Unions issued a declaration to assist the employees of *Shishi Xinbao*, saying that the life of labor is no different from that of horses and cattle. Although hands are omnipotent, they are not machines. The employees of *Shishi Xinbao* complained about the capitalists increasing their extra work and violating the labor-capital contract, and were met with anger. They were instigated to arrest the employees and lock the gate, refusing the workers to enter the factory. All kinds of means are extremely cruel. We are deeply indignant after hearing this. We found that newspapers are a news industry. At this time of national crisis, when tigers and wolves are in the room, we should uphold the spirit of mutual assistance, fill the public opinion to promote national self-determination, and correct international observation. However, the capitalists of the newspaper did not think about this, but relied on the arrogance of copper stink to act arbitrarily and illegally. They are not only the enemies of the labor world, but also a disgrace to civilization. All our compatriots should beat drums and attack them, and never be the same Chinese as them. We are workers, so how can we stand idly by? We are willing to go through fire and water and will not hesitate. We hereby present all the workers in Pudong as the backing of the newspaper's employees, spraying blood as words, and hereby declare. Shanghai Fifth District Cigarette Industry Union, Fifth District Shipbuilding Union, Fifth District Paper Union, Fifth District Loading and Unloading Union, Fifth District Match Union, Fifth District Cotton Textile Union, Fifth District Basket Carrier Union, Fifth District Carpenter Union, Fifth District Cotton Spinning Union, Fifth District Civil Ship Repair Union, Fifth District Winery Union, etc., April 13th.</p>
<h3 id="e22">Postal Workers' Unions Report on the Mediation of the *Shishi Xinbao* Dispute <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Reasons for Mediation: Since the *Shishi Xinbao* dispute occurred, our unions feared that the economic downturn would increase unemployment, and that the fledgling news industry would be hit, especially at this time of national crisis, when the labor and capital forces were divided, it would be impossible to complete the long-term resistance strategy. Therefore, one party issued a declaration to arouse social public opinion to promote labor-capital harmony and mutual assistance, and the other party came forward to mediate and exert patriotic enthusiasm to move labor and capital to be open and honest. People are not wood or stone, and they should be able to solve it easily. This is why our unions came forward to mediate.</p>
<p>Process of Mediation: On April 9th, our union representatives Zhu Xuefan and Huang Gongfu first sought the opinions of the newspaper industry union, and then went to *Shishi Xinbao*, where they were received by Manager Xiong Shaohao. Mr. Xiong sincerely described the cause of the dispute and the two-day grace period for filling out the application form. It is a pity that we could not meet Mr. Xiong on the 10th. On the 11th, it was not until 6 p.m. that we were able to contact Mr. Ren Ping, who was appointed by the newspaper. We accepted Mr. Ren's sincerity and accepted and considered the mediation opinions of our union, and agreed to talk with Mr. Zhang Zhuping, the person in charge of the newspaper, in person at 2 p.m. on the 12th. As a result of the talk on the 12th, our union's mediation was accepted, and our union's opinion was agreed to be answered on the evening of the 9th. At 11 p.m., Mr. Ren was entrusted by Mr. Zhang to contact us, saying that whether or not to restore the state before April 2nd required the opinion of the employees who had filled out the application form and entered the museum to work on the 13th at 11 a.m. to be accepted. At 1 p.m. on the 13th, Mr. Ren was again entrusted by Mr. Zhang to say that because the employees who had filled out the application form and entered the museum to work objected, it was difficult to accommodate the restoration of the previous state. Our union therefore knew that the mediation could not continue, so we notified the above situation to the labor side. This is the factual process of the mediation.</p>
<p>Mediation Opinions: Our union saw the *Shishi Xinbao*'s notice, knowing that workers could enter the museum by filling out an application form, and also received a letter from the labor side, knowing that the labor side's opinion was that the museum should apologize to the union, punish the museum's private arrest of union personnel in this case, compensate the losses suffered by the union this time, and restore the state before April 2nd. After our mediation, the union accepted the following opinions as a mediation method in order to relieve the anxieties of the people. (1) In order to maintain the discipline of the museum, workers should fill out application forms as a matter of course. (2) In order to protect the order set by the labor side (the museum can send a letter to the third party, stating that the union contract) the contract continues to be effective (the letter is kept by the third party). (3) Both sides restore the state before April 2nd.</p>
<p>Understanding of Mediation: The word strike was not ordered by the union. (A) According to the attachment to the museum's letter, the so-called union notice only specified that the union did not agree to the printing of *Da Wan Bao*, so it could not be printed privately. It can be seen that the union did not intend to strike in advance. (B) According to the talks between Mr. Xiong Ren and Mr. Jiang Jiemin himself, the curator Jiang of the museum did have a dispute with the committee member Zhang of the union at the time, and he indicated that he would twist him to the public bureau. According to the museum's letter, there was (the order was chaotic for a while, and the work was stopped. Later, the union sent people to gather all the employees and leave the museum). It can be seen that the employees' leaving the museum and the curator Jiang's improper handling were the reasons for promoting it. (C) According to the museum's letter, 5 o'clock is the time for typesetting advertisements on weekdays, and no employees returned to the museum. At 8 o'clock, it is the time for typesetting news on weekdays, and no employees came to work. Waiting until 9 o'clock, the museum only had accumulated manuscripts, and there was still no employee. The museum saw this situation and surmised that other employees were forced to strike. According to the responsible person of the museum, the museum reported to the police according to secret reports, fearing that the labor side would destroy the capitalists' property, and used force to protect it. At the same time, according to the responsible person of the labor side, the labor side did not enter the museum to work because it feared that the museum would hinder the workers' freedom movement, and at about 10 o'clock, the workers went to inquire about the news, but they were detained in the museum by the police force of the museum. According to the above facts and the union's declaration, it can be proved that the union did not order a strike. (D) The contradiction in the museum's restoration of administrative power. According to the responsible person of the museum, the museum's administrative power on weekdays was often hampered by the union, so it took this opportunity to make it a prerequisite for workers to fill out application forms and obey the museum's regulations. Our union also thought this reason was quite acceptable, so we had the first opinion. Unexpectedly, the museum could not accept the method of restoring the state before April 2nd because the employees who had filled out the application form and entered the museum to work objected, which was unavoidable.</p>
<p>A few concluding words: In short, our union does not want workers to lose their jobs, nor do we want the news industry to be destroyed, and we do not want internal conflicts to occur during the national crisis, which would increase the arrogance of the Japanese. All the mediation opinions are an expression of impartiality, and the labor side is willing to sacrifice everything, just to ensure that the employees do not lose their jobs. Still unable to get the understanding of the other party, the success has failed. I can only blame myself for not being sincere enough to move people, and not being righteous enough to impress the public. The mediation is temporarily suspended. If there is an opportunity for compromise in the future, and our union needs to contribute to it, then what can our union say? I hope people from all walks of life can teach us.

<p>Sheng Zecheng et al. Also File an Appeal</p>
<p>The Debate Has Concluded and the Judgment Is Scheduled to Be Announced</p>
<p>Sheng Zecheng, Pinchen, Panchen, daughters Guan Yi, Fang Yi, Ai Yi, Jing Yi, and grandsons Yu Chang and Yu You, sons of the late Sheng Xuanhuai, were jointly sued by nephews Lin Fengwen and Lin Fengjun for encroaching on the inheritance. Sheng Zechen et al. argued that the Lin brothers had no right to inherit the inheritance and also filed a counterclaim requesting that the plaintiffs be prosecuted for false accusations. After investigation by the First Special District Court, the result was that both parties' accusations were not established, and the judgment was given that they were not guilty. Lin's private lawsuit for analyzing the inheritance was transferred to the civil court for handling. After the judgment, both parties claimed to be dissatisfied and filed separate appeals. Yesterday afternoon, the Criminal Court President Zhou Han of the First Special Court and two judges opened a court session to hear the case, ordering both parties to state their reasons for dissatisfaction. First, Lin Fengwen stated, "My mother's name is Xiao Yi, and she is the third daughter of Duke Bao. My mother gave birth to my two brothers. My mother died when I was only six months old. It has been thirty-five years now. The inheritance I am now requesting is owned by Madame Zhuang, and amounts to approximately three million. Divided among my mother's ten brothers and sisters, I should get 300,000. The inheritance is divided into two types: one is real estate, such as houses, etc., and the other is personal property, such as precious ornaments, antiques, etc. They were all divided up behind closed doors by the defendants and appellants on October 31st last year, and they even encroached on the share that I should inherit. The will they presented is a forgery. Therefore, I am not satisfied with the first instance's judgment that the defendants are not guilty, so I am filing an appeal." Presiding Judge Zhou then threw the will of Madame Zhuang to Lin for review because the will only mentioned that the four, five, six, and eight daughters would each receive 10,000 yuan and did not mention the appellant. Then, Sheng Zecheng, the mother of Lin Fengwen, is the third concubine of my half-brother. I am the son of Madame Zhuang. Madame Zhuang's inheritance is approximately 800,000, which has already been analyzed according to the will. Lin Fengwen has no right to enjoy this inheritance, but he filed a false accusation. I am not satisfied with the first instance's judgment that he is not guilty, so I am filing a special appeal." Next, Sheng Pinchen stated, "Fengwen was raised by my late parents from a young age. Unexpectedly, he has now filed a false accusation, which has a great impact on the world's morality and human heart. This point should be noted." Sheng Yu Chang and Yu You also successively stated that the accusation of encroaching was actually false. The three ladies Sheng Guan Yi, Fang Yi, and Jing Yi all stated that they each received 10,000 yuan in accordance with the will. They were not managers of the inheritance and were not responsible for the encroachment. However, they were also sued for encroachment, which was a false accusation, so they filed a special appeal, requesting that they be prosecuted for false accusations. However, Sheng Ai Yi said that because she was born to Madame Zhuang, she received 200,000 yuan when the inheritance was analyzed, but she was not in charge of the inheritance at the beginning, and the accusation of encroachment was a false accusation. Before Lin filed the lawsuit, he claimed that he needed to get married and run a business, and asked to borrow 30,000 yuan. Although he agreed to ask his brothers to say something, Lin suddenly filed a lawsuit, so it was inconvenient to continue the matter, etc. Finally, the lawyers of both parties debated with each other. The debate concluded, and Presiding Judge Zhou announced that the debate in this case was concluded, and the judgment would be announced on the afternoon of the 19th of this month.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Lung Disease Sanatorium at No. 2 Daxi Road in this city is a specialized hospital for treating tuberculosis. In view of the recent rapid increase in the number of residents in Shanghai, many patients are unable to carry out isolation and treatment due to economic difficulties, which is worrying. The medical director of the hospital, Dr. Ding Huikang, specially discussed with the hospital director, Mr. Huang Hanzhi, and decided to set aside part of the third hospital as a civilian treatment department, charging from one yuan per day. It is now ready and will begin to receive patients from today.</p>

<p>Doctor Yang Yanhe of No. 80, Anshun Lane, Kangti Road, has considerable experience with febrile diseases and seasonal epidemics. According to Mr. Yang, "After a great war, there is sure to be a great plague," as the ancients have warned. Although that time has not yet arrived, this year's measles and smallpox often lead to pneumonia with rapid breathing and nasal flaring. Wind-heat combined with dampness often results in chest congestion and a greasy tongue, with the illness dragging on persistently, which are all signs of it. For prevention, it is advisable to stay in high, dry, and well-ventilated places, frequently sprinkling carbolic acid water. In low-lying, damp, and confined areas, frequently fumigate with Atractylodes lancea and Dahurian angelica root. Carry sweetgrass and spikenard, or camphor balls, with you. It would be even better if you could soak Dryopteris crassirhizoma in a water tank for drinking, and burn frankincense and benzoin in a censer to create a fragrant atmosphere. It is also important to be careful about daily life, moderate diet, and adjust to the temperature to maintain the body's resistance. It is best to abstain from meat such as fish, shrimp, pork, and beef.</p>

<p>(Beiping) Rong Zhen stated to the Investigation Commission that the Japanese illegally occupied the Eastern Provinces by force, and that our army withdrew its defenses out of respect for the League of Nations' spirit of non-aggression and to maintain world justice and peace, not out of non-resistance. He requested that the League of Nations pay attention to this point. The members of the commission seemed to agree with his statement. (Special dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<h3 id="e33">Regarding the Secret Agreement on Parallel Railway Lines <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) The memorandum prepared by the Chinese delegation, except for the issue of parallel railway lines in the Eastern Provinces, has been completed and submitted to Lytton. The Japanese are using the attachment to the secret agreement signed with Prince Qing in 1905 as a pretext for the issue of parallel railway lines in the Eastern Provinces. When the Investigation Commission passed by, the Japanese side showed it to them. It is said that the Japanese side was very secretive at the time, claiming that the Chinese had already lost it. It took a very long time to retrieve it from an iron box. The members of the Investigation Commission were quite impatient. Therefore, when the commission returned to the capital from Hankou, they were invited to disembark and shown the original agreement. Now both sides have sent photographic copies to the Investigation Commission. The commission has entrusted the embassy to carefully translate it. It is said that although the attachment mentioned that the Sino-Belgian treaty stipulated that parallel railway lines should be built more than 100 li apart to be considered very satisfactory, the existing railways in the three Eastern Provinces that run parallel to the South Manchuria Railway are on average more than 200 li apart and do not violate the treaty. Moreover, this attachment was never formally signed, so whether it can be considered legal is still questionable. The reason for the intense debate between the two sides lies here.

However, given that the Manchurian state has already expressed its position, danger is almost unavoidable. (Special dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese representative Yoshida secretly told a counselor of the Chinese delegation that Representative Gu's entry into Manchuria would be very dangerous. Furthermore, a counselor from the Japanese embassy visited the Chinese delegation and expressed concern about Representative Gu's trip to Manchuria, fearing that the outcome would be more ominous than auspicious.

<p>(Beiping) In addition to formally exchanging opinions with the authorities and various parties in recent days, many leaders have spoken privately with individual members of the commission through introductions from embassies. The results have been very good, and the Investigation Commission has obtained a wealth of information. The current difficulty lies in how to formulate a plan that is both satisfactory to the Chinese side and acceptable to the Japanese side. (Special dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Investigation Commission is seeking opinions from all sectors, focusing on solutions. However, it is difficult for our side to express our position at this time, and it is not easy to strike the right balance.

<p>Commending the People of Shanghai and Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>Encouraging Representative Yan and Soldiers of the Nation</p>
<p>(Luoyang) The National Crisis Conference sent the following cables on the 12th: (1) To comfort Representative Yan Huiqing, (2) To commend overseas Chinese for donating money to save the country, (3) To commend the people of Shanghai, (4) To encourage the soldiers of the nation. The original texts are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>To comfort Representative Yan Please forward to Representative Yan Huiqing from the Nanjing Ministry of Foreign Affairs. During this League of Nations conference, you negotiated and deliberated, worrying day and night, and were able to proclaim the world's righteousness and win international sympathy. Your diplomatic efforts are no less than fighting on the front lines. We are heartbroken by the national crisis and gather in the capital. We look up to your contributions from afar and deeply admire you. We send this telegram to comfort your hard work and hope that you will continue to fight and turn the tide. The country and the nation rely on you. National Crisis Conference Presidium Wang Xiaolai, Gao Yihan, Liu Hengjing, Tong Guanqian, Zang Qifang and all members.</p>
<p>Commending Overseas Chinese To all overseas Chinese in various ports, Over the years, there have been disasters and famines in the country, and our overseas Chinese have been known for their generosity in providing financial assistance. Recently, due to the increasing foreign aggression, you have donated funds to purchase weapons, raising more than tens of millions, which shows your patriotic enthusiasm. This conference is deeply grateful for your solidarity in times of crisis. We send this telegram to commend you and hope that you will continue to support the motherland with practical strength. (Same title as above)</p>
<p>Commending the people of Shanghai To all groups, people, and volunteer armies in Shanghai, Our soldiers in Songhu fought bravely for more than a month to defend territorial sovereignty, and their spirit of sacrifice shocked the world. And all sectors of our Shanghai compatriots have either exhausted their wealth or donated everything they have, and their material and spiritual assistance is a manifestation of national will, making the strong neighbor know that our people cannot be bullied and our country cannot be destroyed. The revival of the Chinese nation depends on this. In the midst of deep wounds and pain, we are filled with respect for the patriotic enthusiasm of our compatriots. We send this telegram to comfort and encourage you, and hope that you will continue to work hard to win the final victory. (Slightly abbreviated title)</p>
<p>Encouraging the soldiers of the nation To all commanders-in-chief, army commanders, division commanders, and all soldiers, The violent Japan, with its power, first occupied Liaoning, Jilin, Harbin, and Heilongjiang, and then disturbed Songhu. The situation is serious and there is no room for complacency. This conference believes that the way to save the country is to unite and rise up. In this autumn of power struggles, defending the country depends on the soldiers of the nation fulfilling their duties. Now, we sincerely offer four points: (1) End internal strife forever and resist foreign aggression. First, stop fratricide. If the nest is overturned, there will be no whole eggs. At this time when the enemy's troops are deeply entrenched, we must unite sincerely and work together to survive. Differences of opinion and conflicts of interest should all be eliminated with the goal of saving the nation. (2) Fight for a long time, endure hardship and be determined. Things are difficult, and we must fill the sea and move mountains. Our ambition is only to advance. The revival of Yue by Goujian and the resistance of Greece by Turkey are all examples of achieving final victory with the greatest determination. They rely on material, we rely on will. They seek speed, we benefit from persistence. We would rather sacrifice than surrender. For example, in the Battle of Songhu, our patriotic soldiers did well. (3) Absolutely obey the orders of the highest commander. The army was defeated in Xiangzhou because there was no commander. On the verge of fighting, we succeeded in facing the water. Relying on each other and acting like arms and fingers can we respond to the enemy. Talking about war without effective command, delaying efforts, wasting money and grain, and missing opportunities, how can we act as a shield and how can we face the people? Our loyal and brave soldiers must not do this. (4) Maintain the overall unity of finance, and advance both affairs and achievements. Military and political affairs should be separated, and we should abide by the law and be honest. Public and military affairs are the same. If we intercept national taxes in the name of military expenses, destroying the administrative system, or following in the footsteps of warlords, the financial future will be obstructed and the danger will increase, which our patriotic soldiers cannot bear. These four points are a rough outline. In the face of national crisis, it is a matter of life and death. The line between survival and destruction lies in one heart. We must revive the national spirit and be the vanguard of the people. May all our armed compatriots strive for it. (Slightly abbreviated title) (Central News Agency telegram on the 12th)</p>

<p>Serious Situation Feared</p>
<p>(Harbin) Currently, because Soviet Russia is moving Chinese Eastern Railway trains into Russian territory, export merchants cannot obtain sufficient freight cars to transport goods. The Chinese Eastern Railway Bureau must soon decide on one of the following three options: (1) Attempt to recover the trains, which is extremely difficult in the current situation. (2) Purchase new cars, which requires raising loans from foreign countries. (3) Convert the southern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway to narrow gauge so that trains from the South Manchuria Railway can be used, which would be equivalent to extending the South Manchuria Railway line to Harbin. If none of the above three options are approved by the Russian officials of the Railway Bureau, the new government of Manchuria will face an extremely difficult situation. It must either admit its inability to resolve this matter or devise another solution, and the result will be a very serious situation between the new government of Manchuria and the Soviet Union. As of April 5th, the Chinese Eastern Railway's funds and bank deposits totaled 11,750,000 Japanese yen, of which 9,834,000 yen was held in current accounts at the Far Eastern Bank and the Vladivostok National Bank, and the remaining funds were deposited in various Chinese and foreign banks.

<p>Eden States British Position</p>
<p>(London) During this afternoon's session of the House of Commons, members raised many questions to the government about the situation in the Far East. Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Eden addressed the issue of the new government of Manchuria, stating that Foreign Secretary Simon had not expressed any opinion on the Japanese government's impending recognition of the new government of Manchuria. As far as he knew, the Japanese government's policy remained the same as that stated by the Foreign Secretary in response to questions in the House of Commons in February. At that time, the Foreign Secretary stated that the Japanese government would be more inclined to recognize this new country than any other government. Eden also stated that recognition was not related to the Open Door Policy, and that discussing this matter would not be beneficial. He had seen proclamations from Manchuria stating that the Open Door Policy might be subject to change, but the British position had already been clearly stated, and continuing to state it would not be beneficial unless there was direct evidence of harm to British interests. Eden also answered a question from Conservative MP Knox regarding the Japanese army's occupation of Chinese territory near Shanghai, stating that the Japanese 24th Mixed Brigade and 11th Division had been withdrawn to their home country in the second half of March. The Allied forces in Shanghai reported to League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond on March 21st that after a partial withdrawal of Japanese troops, there were still 37,000 troops. To his knowledge, this was the total number of Japanese troops currently stationed in Shanghai. Knox also mentioned Japan's desire to secure the safety of life and property of its residents, stating that last year Britain was willing to relinquish the rights of Britons in Shanghai, and asked whether Japan would increase its anxiety because of Britain's attitude, and whether Britain might make another (contribution) in the future. Eden replied that he felt it was unhelpful to discuss the merits of the dispute currently under negotiation. He could not say how far the negotiations would extend or to what extent they would need to continue before they concluded. (13th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

Regarding the reduction of freight rates, comprehensive planning will also be undertaken, and adjustments will be made as needed. (13th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Geneva, 12th (National Telegram) According to investigations by local authorities here, the total number of representatives from various countries here is over 100. This is because there are currently three conferences being held simultaneously: the Disarmament Conference, the League of Nations Council meeting, and the International Labor Conference. If the personnel of the various national delegations, including secretaries, are included, the number can reach five or six thousand. Geneva, a small place, suddenly adding so many people, feels quite overcrowded. A diplomat from a major European country expressed great regret about the outward clamor of Geneva, saying that while the outward appearance is like this, the content is really unfathomable. In recent months, the credibility of the League of Nations has been almost completely lost. The functions of the past have now been reduced to the extreme. Although representatives from all countries gather from all directions, it is just a matter of commotion and does not help the actual situation.</p>
<p>London, 12th (Havas) British Prime Minister MacDonald will go to Geneva around April 20th. Stimson will also arrive in Switzerland at that time.</p>

<p>Chairman Tardieu Summarizes the Four-Power Conference</p>
<p>Finance Committee Report Decided to Re-Submit for Review</p>
<p>Geneva, 12th (National Telegram) The 56th session of the League of Nations Council opened this afternoon. French Prime Minister Tardieu, as chairman, first held a closed-door meeting to consider the agenda and discuss issues of a confidential nature. Then, an open meeting was held. Tardieu first delivered an opening speech, summarizing the London Four-Power Conference, saying that at that time, because the countries wanted to have the whole problem studied by experts again and then take practical steps, no agreement could be reached. The important agenda item of this session is the Finance Committee's report and its recommendation to lend to the four countries of Austria, Hungary, Greece, and Romania to avoid their financial collapse. British Foreign Secretary Simon began the discussion, questioning the effectiveness of further lending to the Danube states, because these states have been temporarily saved from financial difficulties by previous loans, but their burdens have become increasingly heavy, leading to today's predicament. German Vice Foreign Minister Pulo continued, tracing the cause of the Danube countries' predicament today to the peace treaty imposing impossible financial and economic conditions, which ultimately led to the unavoidable danger of bankruptcy, and asked the Council to pay attention to the Finance Committee's report, which emphasized that resolving the issues of reparations and war debts is of great importance to rescuing the Danube states. After Pulo's speech, the meeting adjourned and was scheduled to continue tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>Geneva, 12th (National Telegram) The League of Nations Council held a special meeting today to consider the financial problems of assisting Central European countries. French Prime Minister Tardieu immediately passed a resolution that representatives from the four countries of Britain, France, Italy, and Germany, which had failed to reach an agreement at the recent London conference, would meet with financial experts from the League of Nations to re-examine the report of the League of Nations Finance Committee, and then make a final decision on the method of assistance. It is now likely that the League of Nations Council will not be able to take any action to assist the fire-stricken finances of the Danube countries before the regular meeting on May 9th after this review, and general observers of current affairs even doubt whether the fundamental outlines can be agreed upon at an early date during the review, because the four countries sending representatives are limited to the four countries that failed to reach an agreement in London recently. The countries clearly know that the financial recovery of Central European countries is of great importance to them, but in order to safeguard their selfish national interests, a deadlock has been created, and it is now hoped that this deadlock can be broken through the mediation of League of Nations experts.</p>

<p>Geneva, 12th (National Telegram) At the League of Nations Council meeting this afternoon, two telegrams from Lord Lytton of the Lytton Commission of Inquiry were read. The first telegram asked the member states of the Council to instruct their ambassadors in Beiping and consuls in various places in the three eastern provinces to fully assist the Commission of Inquiry so that it could carry out this arduous task. This request has been immediately relayed by the League of Nations to the governments concerned. The second telegram stated that the Manchukuo puppet government had refused to allow Gu Weijun to go to Manchukuo. Lytton clearly attached great importance to this obstruction and firmly stated that the Commission of Inquiry would not allow external parties to raise questions about the status of any member. Finally, he said that if the authorities of Manchukuo made any further attempts to obstruct the work of the Commission of Inquiry, he would immediately report to the Council.</p>

<p>France Advocates Organizing International Army to Sanction Aggression</p>
<p>Proposes Complete Abolition of Lethal Weapons on Land, Sea, and Air</p>
<p>Geneva, 12th (National Agency) The General Committee of the International Disarmament Conference continued its general discussion this afternoon. Chairman Henderson, French Prime Minister Tardieu spoke, attacking the proposal made yesterday by U.S. representative Gibson to abolish tanks, cannons, and chemical warfare equipment, insisting that this proposal cannot solve the problem of disarmament. Only by implementing the French plan can an international authority with the power to sanction be created in the future. Finally, he warned the committee not to make merely immediate emergency resolutions. The committee then adjourned so that Tardieu could go to chair the League of Nations Council meeting.</p>
<p>Paris, 12th (Havas) Tardieu's speech at the Disarmament Conference said, in part, "If a country dares to violate the provisions of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which renounce war as an instrument of policy, then it will be even more unbridled in regard to other secondary provisions, such as the prohibition of possessing or using certain ordnance. Therefore, a system of surveillance is indispensable, and sanctions are even more necessary. The reason why France's proposal advocates that whoever violates the pact should be judged as an aggressor is precisely for this reason. Abolishing ordnance in terms of substance not only fails to equalize the countries, but its nature is hypocritical and impractical, because no matter what kind of ordnance can be used for attack, it can also be used for defense, and vice versa, defensive ordnance can also be transferred to attack. To remedy this, preventing all wars is the only way. But to do so, the international organization must have the strongest weapons, and no country's military strength can exceed it. France's proposal follows the spirit of the Covenant, one side being prevention and the other being sanctions, seeking a method of practical guarantee, and its essence lies in this. This proposal is an active answer to the disarmament problem, and is not like those who advocate abolishing ordnance in substance, who are merely indulging in empty talk."</p>
<p>Geneva, 13th (Reuters) Italian Foreign Minister Grandi today advocated at the Disarmament Conference the complete abolition of heavy artillery, bomber aircraft, battleships, submarines, tanks, aircraft carriers, and germ warfare tactics. Grandi declared that the army, navy, and air force should abolish their most powerful weapons, which would make international aggression more difficult.</p>

<h3 id="e90">Counterfeit Country's Opium and Gambling Policies <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Customs, Salt Revenues, and Postal Services Seized by the Japanese</p>
<p>The Counterfeit Country Will Rely on Opium and Gambling as its Lifeline</p>
<p>Northeast Transportation Rights Also Fall Entirely into Japanese Hands</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: All counterfeit policies of the Northeast counterfeit country are manipulated by the Japanese. The so-called counterfeit cabinet and counterfeit departments are merely empty shells. The customs, salt revenues, and postal services within the Northeast territory generate an annual income of over 80 million. Due to the urgent needs of the Japanese, the counterfeit country has openly dispatched personnel to take over in the name of the Manchukuo counterfeit country. However, the customs offices, due to their involvement in foreign debt guarantees, have refused to be taken over by foreign staff. In Shenyang, the counterfeit country's takeover commissioner, accompanied by Japanese troops, threatened to forcibly take over, leading to a customs closure in resistance. The Andong customs office and the Harbin customs office have also resisted in the same way, so the current system has been temporarily maintained. The Bank of China, where the salt revenues are deposited, has been repeatedly urged by the Japanese to have the counterfeit country withdraw the funds. The bank's branches within the Northeast territory are unable to cope and have responded by requesting a grace period. The Bank of China has telegraphed the Ministry of Finance for a solution. Until a solution is found, the bank has decided not to make any allocations. The situation in the post offices is similar to that of the customs offices. Foreign staff have refused to be taken over and have stated that they can only transfer control with an order from the Chinese government. The counterfeit country's commissioner has led multiple Japanese soldiers to the three general bureaus in Jilin, Shenyang, and Harbin for negotiations, but the results have been fruitless. The Japanese are eyeing the 30 million in postal revenue and are threatening to cut off postal communication. To maintain postal services, the post offices have submitted a request to the Ministry of Communications for instructions while suspending the acceptance of domestic remittances and insurance letters to avoid losses for mailers. It is rumored that two secretaries from the League of Nations investigation team have secretly come to the Northeast to conduct investigations into the aforementioned two matters. The Japanese are aware of this and have ordered a vigorous search for the whereabouts of the two secretaries to monitor their activities. The counterfeit country's current financial situation is dire due to the economic decline in various regions and the burden of supporting the Japanese military. (It is said that they must bear 3 million in Japanese military expenses each month.) Therefore, the Japanese are instigating the counterfeit country to implement new policies to increase revenue. One policy is opium monopoly, where the counterfeit customs will draft regulations to implement a monopoly on opium planting, with an estimated annual revenue of 20 million. The other policy is the construction of an international horse racing track in Changchun, with horse races and champagne lottery sales four times a year, also with an estimated revenue of 20 million. These two sources of revenue will be used to fund the counterfeit country's military and administrative expenses. The revenue from customs, salt, and postal services will be managed by the Japanese, ostensibly as trustees, but in reality, it will be completely swallowed by the Japanese.</p>
<p>The central bank that the Japanese are planning for the counterfeit country was originally intended to have a capital of 20 million Japanese yen, to be loaned by the Japanese. However, the Japanese have recently felt economic panic and are unable to provide this large sum. Therefore, they falsely claim that the Japanese government will not provide direct loans until it officially recognizes Manchukuo. Instead, Dongtuo, Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Mantetsu, and other companies will jointly lend 20 million silver dollars. In reality, these companies do not have such a large amount of cash for lending. Therefore, in the future, the Chosen Bank and the Yokohama Specie Bank may issue 20 million in gold notes to inject capital. The counterfeit central bank is scheduled to open on April 11, but the date is approaching, and there is no news, likely due to a lack of funds. According to the regulations of the counterfeit central bank drafted by the Japanese, there will be one governor and one comptroller. The governor will be Chinese, and the comptroller will be Japanese. However, all administrative expenditures must be signed by the comptroller to be valid. There will be seven directors, four Japanese and three Chinese, and five supervisors, two Japanese and three Chinese. Observing these numbers alone reveals where the power and responsibility of the counterfeit central bank lie. The position of counterfeit governor was originally intended to be filled by Pu Wei, but Pu Wei has his own agenda and is not cooperating with Pu Yi, so he is unlikely to accept the position. Therefore, there is news that it will be concurrently filled by Xi Qia.</p>
<p>Xi Qia is the number one meritorious official of the counterfeit regime, taking care of everything. In the counterfeit regime, he is considered second to none and above all others. Zheng Xiaoxu is nominally the counterfeit prime minister, but he is merely a messenger. Since Xi Qia has become complacent, Ma Zhanshan, Zang Shiyi, and others are quite resentful. Ma, due to his history of resisting Japan, is deeply resented by other traitors, who are trying to squeeze him out. Therefore, Ma is restless. He recently used an inspection as an excuse to take refuge in Baiquan in eastern Heilongjiang and refuses to return to the province. The counterfeit regime, fearing that this will trigger internal strife, has not hastily announced a replacement. Zhao Xinbo is the only favorite in front of Honjo Shigeru, but he has recently fallen out of favor because Zhao is involved in embezzlement. His position as mayor of Shenyang has been taken by the Japanese, who have appointed Yan Rentao, a former Dalian city councilor, to the position. Zhao has been promoted to the president of the counterfeit Legislative Yuan, but this is just an empty position, controlled entirely by the Japanese, and not as famous and profitable as the mayor's position. Therefore, Zhao is quite resentful and may refuse to take on the role of reception during the League of Nations investigation team's visit to the Northeast.</p>
<p>The various railways in the Northeast outstanding issues are currently being unilaterally resolved by the Japanese, who are constructing the Hu-Hai and Qi-Ke railways and having the counterfeit country sign agreements to transfer them to Mantetsu. The cost of the Qi-Ke railway is unknown, but the cost of the Hu-Hai railway is 6 million silver dollars. After the transfer, the Japanese will connect the tracks, linking the Qi-Ke and Hu-Hai railways into one line. These two railways were built with the blood and sweat of the people of Heilongjiang province for many years, and it is deeply regrettable that they have now been seized by the Japanese. (7th)</p>

<p>Li Mingrui's Forces Completely Eliminated</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: After the Cantonese army under Yu Hanmou advanced into southern Jiangxi, it contacted Luo Zhuoying, Zhou Zhirou, and other units. He also ordered his troops to advance from Xinfeng and Ganxian towards the bandit areas of Yudu and Xingguo. It was found that the bandits in Xingguo and Yudu were the 5th Army under the pseudonym Peng Dehuai, the 7th Army under the pseudonym Li Mingrui, etc. As the national army retreated at every step, they entrenched themselves in the dangerous areas of Caoping, Gaotang, and Tangkeng and stubbornly resisted. According to military news, Li's bandits, about 7,000 in number, suffered heavy losses after being attacked by the national army. It is reported that Li Mingrui was captured alive by the national army on the 7th in a mountain in Yudu. Yudu was also recovered by the national army. As for the Cantonese army stationed in Xinfeng, Nankang, Ganxian, etc., they are currently carrying out "cleansing the countryside." For example, Ye Zhao's division is searching for remnants in the Longhukou area and organizing local militias. All the bandits from the Longhui bandit nests are fleeing to Yueling and Hanfang. The 5th Army under the pseudonym Peng Dehuai, originally stationed in Xiaofang and Niuling, has about 2,000 men and is building trenches in the Hanfang area. However, Peng's bandits lack ammunition, so it should not be difficult to wipe them out in one go.</p>

<h3 id="e92">Financial Market: The Bull Market Continues in Shanghai <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Gold Prices Rise by 14 Taels and 3 Mace</p>
<p>Active Spot Trading and Aggressive Short Covering Fuel Gains: Yesterday, the Shanghai gold market continued its bull run, advancing steadily. The intraday range was 11.5 taels, with a final surge of 14 taels. The decline in silver prices prompted early morning trading above the 710-tael mark. Bullish sentiment was fueled by the approaching settlement date, compelling short sellers to cover their positions aggressively, fearing further bullish pressure. The strength stemmed from active spot trading, driven by ongoing purchases from a certain bank. Market participants showed heightened confidence. Tightness in exchange rates also forced firms to scramble to cover their short positions, engaging in substantial hedging activities. Consequently, market prices surged unhindered, exceeding 720 taels. However, a certain bank sought to buy more cash but did not initiate any transactions due to disagreements over pricing. Foreign exchange markets lacked activity due to it being Wednesday. A detailed account of the day's trading is provided below.</p>
<p>Silver Prices Open Lower, Boosting Sentiment: The May contract opened higher by 3 taels and 3 mace at 712 taels. Large bars retreated by 1/8, while silver prices also decreased by 1/4. Limited American selling and private telegraphs also weakened by 1/16, boosting sentiment. Subsequent trading reached 13 taels and 5 mace, but sales by Hengyu and others caused a decline to 11 taels and 5 mace. Prices then advanced by 3 mace as Zhifengyong, Yongtai and others increased their buying activity. A rise in the exchange rate to 15 taels and 2 mace was reported at 9:30, prompting sales by Tong Taichang and others, retreating to 13 taels and 5 mace. However, strong buying from the Dalian group and others drove prices to 15-16 taels. A settlement rate of 0.5 yuan to 375 for US dollars and HSBC's reduction in its license band caused a decline to 15 taels and 7 mace by 11:00. Continued buying after this time drove prices higher by over 3 taels, reaching 19 taels and 1 mace at noon. The closing price was 18 taels and 6 mace. The initial quotation was 771 taels, reduced by 56-57 taels to 54 taels, then to 780 taels, reduced by 62 taels to 64-65 taels. The noon close was 61 taels.</p>
<p>Bullish Momentum Continues, Exceeding 720 Taels: Afternoon trading opened at 18 taels and 8 mace, fluctuating between 19 taels and 18.5 taels, with small purchases at 19 taels and 4 mace. However, selling by Yuhe and Hong Kangyong caused a retreat to 18 taels and 6 mace. Shortly after, buying by Tong Fengheng and others pushed prices beyond 720 taels. After 2:00 PM, continuous buying from Hong Kangfang and others added another 2 taels. At 3:00 PM, prices reached 21 taels and 8 mace. Limited selling by Fuyu caused a decline to 20 taels and 2 mace. Rapid buying by Zhifengyong and short sellers drove prices up by over 2 taels. At 4:00 PM, prices reached 22 taels and 5 mace, then retreated to 21 taels and 6 mace. General bullish sentiment drove prices higher, attempting to achieve a double settlement. The market closed at 4:30 PM at 23 taels, a significant increase of 14 taels and 3 mace from the previous day, then falling back to around 22 taels and 5 mace as retail investors sold off. However, trading volume was low. The day's highest price was 23 taels, and the lowest price was 11.5 taels, a difference of 11.5 taels. The quotation was reduced by around 60 taels, ending at 57-58 taels. Registration ranged from 13 to 19 taels, with 13 taels in supplementary water. The afternoon rate was 17 taels, with a 5-tael increase for red bars.</p>
<p>Firms Scramble to Cover Positions: In inter-dealer trading, Zhifengyong, Yifengyong, Daxingyong, Fuchang, Yuanheng, Hongyuanyong, and Futaiheng were predominantly buyers, while Wanxing, Shunli, and Yuantai experienced frequent shifts. Tong Taichang, Yuhe, Yuanmaoyong, Qianchangxiang, and Yuankangxiang reduced their sales. Dadecheng had a total of 2,000 bars, with more selling than buying. In the afternoon, Zhifengyong, Tong Fengheng, Yifengyong, Yu Da, and Shunli were predominantly buyers, while Yuantai, Futaiheng, and Yuanmaoyong shifted between buying and selling. Qianchangxiang and Dadecheng were predominantly sellers, while Yuhe had over 600 bars, slightly increasing by over 100 bars after adjustments.</p>

<p>The decline of the Yuan cent yesterday exceeded the normal range, opening at a new low price never heard of before. The morning market was at 7 mace and 0.03 li, and the afternoon market was at 0.02 li. As a result, the lowest price in the afternoon market was even lower by 0.015 li compared to the previous day.

<p>Settlement of Layoffs Continues with Significant Increases Yesterday</p>
<p>After the stock exchange settled old transactions using gray market transfers, it has been holding meetings at its location at approximately 11 AM to conduct gray market transactions, completing settlements daily. Yesterday, settlements were completed for one 10,000 yuan 1920 and a 5,000 yuan demobilization. According to reliable sources, gray market prices are very stable, with demobilization bonds being the most stable. In addition to the two yuan increase from the previous day, there was another increase of almost half a yuan yesterday. Other bonds, excluding the repayment recorded for February and March, were also up compared to the recorded price before the market shutdown, but only by about half a yuan. There were no transactions for the reorganization 6% bonds and the 1996 bonds, and there were no reports of the gray market situation.</p>
<h3 id="e97">No Hope for Spring Sales of Yarn, Fabric, and Cotton Yarn <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>There is Talk of Standard Fabric Auctions Starting Next Week</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market is increasingly depressed, with a very bleak outlook and a risk of further price declines. Due to political instability, it is difficult for credit to recover, and the financial sector cannot fully extend loans to the business sector, making it difficult for business to thrive. Inventories at factories are increasing, causing a major setback in confidence, and hopes for peak spring sales have been dashed by the war. Therefore, there is no hope for a short-term boom in the yarn market, and there is a risk of a major price crash. According to brokers, the stock exchange's standard flower yarn market may reopen next Monday. According to statistics, brokers bought a total of 400 bales throughout the day, with prices falling by 2.5 to 5 mace. Guest brokers from Guangdong bought 35 bales, Shantou bought 185 bales, the interior bought 15 bales, Tianjin bought 20 bales, Ningbo bought 5 bales, and other brokers bought 125 bales.</p>

<p>The cotton market is in a quiet state, but the American cotton market is stable, while Indian cotton has rebounded by 6-7 rupees. The rising gold price has strengthened confidence, but there is still no strong demand due to weak yarn sales and political uncertainty. However, Shenxin has settled 3-4,000 pieces of American cotton and purchased local cotton for use, making the factory's procurement particularly lively. The records of spot cotton sales are listed on the left:</p>
<p>Dongtai Cotton: 34.00, Shenxin purchased 1,000 bales of spot goods for delivery to the factory</p>
<p>Zhengzhou Cotton: 34.50, Shenxin purchased 500 pieces of spot goods for delivery to the factory</p>
<p>Lingbao Cotton: 36.50, Shenxin purchased 200 pieces of spot goods for delivery to the factory</p>

<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market lacked direction, with prices fluctuating. Prices initially weakened due to long liquidation but then strengthened due to short covering. Futures prices rose by 1-3 points, while spot prices remained unchanged. British cotton spot and futures prices both rose by 3 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices remained unchanged. The Indian cotton market was stable, with Bai Luo Xi rising by 5.75 rupees. The telegraph record is listed on the left (12th telegraph):</p>

<p>South Shanghai: Yesterday, the supply from various sources was not abundant. City and rural retailers had little inventory. The price of rice from Suzhou and Tongzhou fell by 2 jiao. The price of middle-grade japonica rice continued to decline by 3 jiao. There was a shortage of premium Yangdu rice, and sales were scarce, so the market also weakened. The sales of early rice were the most active, and the market was bullish. The supply of thin rice also turned weak, and the channels were still normal in the morning. The market remained stable, but the weather suddenly turned windy in the afternoon, and the situation for traders turned bullish.</p>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, there were 5-6 ships from the west road. Trading in this street was lighter than before. The channels for early and late rice were scarce, and the opening price was lowered by 2 jiao. Supplies from Wuxi and Liyang arrived and were sold immediately, with no price changes. Traders slightly purchased Yanglu and premium sand boats, and the market improved by 1 jiao. There was no supply of premium rice from Changzhou, so there was no report.</p>

<p>17,000 bags were opened in the unified market::: jumping up by one jiao. Yesterday, the processed rice market suddenly saw a boom in sales, with prices jumping up by one jiao. This was unexpected by sellers in the market. Since arrivals have been constant recently, and inventories are sufficient, sales have been average for the past few days, and prices have been stable and soft. Yesterday, there was a sudden surge in purchases from the Yangtze River region, including Hankou, Jiangxi, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, and other places. Traders from Ningbo and Changzhou-Wuxi also started competing for supplies, and the market suddenly became tight and trading was booming. A total of 17,000 bags of small-granule rice were opened, with the price of high-grade rice rising by one jiao, and the price of medium-grade rice rising by 0.5 jiao, with prices ranging from 9.75 to 9.48 yuan and medium-grade rice ranging from 9.4 to 9.1 yuan. 200 bags of Saigon No. 1 rice were opened, with a price of 10.087 yuan. 500 bags of Mindang rice were opened, with a price of 9.875 to 9.8 yuan. The price of futures rice for the afternoon of June was 4 taels, 6 mace, 8 fen to 4 taels, 6 mace, 5 fen, and the price of futures rice for May was 4 taels, 8 mace, 1 fen to 4 taels, 8 mace, and both were up by 0.5 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3 id="e102">The Flour Market After Foreign Merchants Purchase <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Prices Rise by Two to Three Fen::: May Has Already Exceeded 2 Taels and 1 Qian</p>
<p>Yesterday, both spot and futures flour prices jumped due to foreign merchants purchasing spot flour for shipment to the Soviet Union and poor harvests of foreign wheat in various regions. American Cambrian wheat prices have jumped by nearly 2 yuan in three consecutive days of telegraphed increases. Therefore, the market jumped up in the morning and became tighter in the afternoon. The price of Bingshipai spot flour reached 2 taels, 0.0975 yuan, an increase of two to three fen compared to the previous day. Prices of other brands rose uniformly. The price of May flour reached 2 taels, 0.1175 yuan. Manufacturers' asking prices were even higher, and hoarding was very strong. The future market seems likely to continue to improve.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Sugar Market: Coarse Granulated and White Sugar Rise Again <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Ice Flower Green is in High Demand</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Sugar Association trading floor continued to see slow trading, but market sentiment seemed to be stabilizing. The transaction price of Dutch Sugar No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar rose to 13 taels, an increase of 0.05 yuan compared to the previous round, but both buying and selling were sluggish. Taikoo Sugar B Mark was priced at 16 taels, 2 qian, with few buyers. HX Mark was priced at 14 taels, 6 qian, with scarce supplies and strong demand. HM Mark was priced at 13 taels, 6 qian to 6 qian 7.5 fen, with the asking price at 13 taels 7 qian for the next round and a strong market shape. The high-grade ice flower green from this factory was priced at 11 taels and 1.5 qian, produced by the Xiangyuan factory. Because the demand for this sugar exceeds supply, there is a shortage, so the trend is extraordinarily bullish.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Southern and Northern Goods: Small-Style Dried Longan is in Short Supply and the Market is Tight <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Incident, the sales of dried longan have been very scarce, especially the sales of high-grade dried longan. As a result, prices for Xingzheng second-grade and miscellaneous high-grade dried longan have weakened, but supplies from various places are also scarce. It is observed that there is no shortage of large-sized dried longan in the market, but small-sized dried longan is becoming increasingly scarce, so small-style dried longan is standing out and is in short supply.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Dyed Fabrics: Soft Light Serge is the Most Severe <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Soft light serge fabrics have been selling well in recent years, mostly used for lined clothing. Previously, they were all goods from the East, but after the anti-Japanese goods movement, the Shanghai Printing and Dyeing Company also produced them, branded as Sanyi Tu. Lun Chang also does dyeing on behalf of others, branded as Seven Roses. Recently, sales of this fabric should have been at their peak, but the market is declining, with a river-like trend. This is because inventories are full, and those who hold the goods are urgently seeking to sell them off, making it difficult to maintain prices. Currently, Shanghai Company has launched a low-price product of 50 pieces, so the decline is even more severe. Yesterday, Sanyi Tu sold for 5 taels 7.5 qian, and Seven Roses sold for 6 taels. Grey light serge is most stable when it is Dafeng goods, opening at 5 taels 9 qian, and miscellaneous brands are at 5 taels 2.5 qian, but the trend is silent. White thick cotton flannel is also weakening daily because the season has passed. Yihe Three Deer Head opens at 3 qian 2.5 fen per yard. Qingfeng Shuangyu Jiqing opens at 3 qian 1.5 fen. Yesterday, Lun Chang's printed color twill was still 2 qian 2.5 fen for dark colors and 1 qian 9.5 fen for white ground. Striped cloth must be at 1 qian 9 fen, and striped bleached cloth is still selling for 8 taels 7.5 qian for Yihe Five Blessings and 8 taels 5 qian for the brand of Shou Sheng Tu.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the business of zinc sheets was unusually enthusiastic. In total, more than 1,000 barrels were sold. Due to a large shortage of spot goods, prices soared. Thin colored sheets were selling for up to 25 taels and 7.5 qian per load, while thicker colored sheets were also selling for up to 24 taels and 2.5 qian. It is said that many traders from the Yangtze River and Tianjin are still collecting goods, so the future market outlook is very optimistic.</p>

<p>After the Shanghai Incident, buyers generally canceled orders for scrap iron from overseas, so spot goods have not been seen in Shanghai for several months. Yesterday, spot goods arrived at wharves such as Gonghexang North Depot, totaling more than 5,000 loads. This can be called the first batch of goods to arrive after the ceasefire.</p>

<p>Some say the Kuomintang truly has profound research into the (art of holding meetings); but looking at the national representative assemblies, central executive and supervisory meetings, national conferences, and even the current national crisis conference, as well as other numerous conferences on education, internal affairs, industry and commerce, finance, aviation, disbandment, ::::, convened over the past five years, which one did not resoundingly resolve many proposals beneficial to the country and the people, giving the public (a temporary excitement)? Among them, there is a very mysterious magic that can make members unable to speak no matter what opinions they want to express once they attend a meeting, and those who oppose become supporters. Isn't this clear proof of the (art of holding meetings)?</p>
<p>The Kuomintang only has the (art of holding meetings), the (art of destruction), but no (art of construction). Alas, the people have only now realized that everything the government has declared in the past is (hypocritical)! Therefore, disasters and chaos occur frequently, the people's livelihood is devastated, there are no solutions for (pacification) and (disaster relief), and even less of a solution is seen for the (national crisis)!</p>

<p>— Tian Hen</p>
<p>The Japanese have no regard for China. Even less regard for the League of Nations. They actually established the puppet state of Manchuria while the League of Nations investigation team was on its way to China. What they once hesitated and lingered over, not daring to put into practice, is now being carried out one by one. For example, the customs duties of the three northeastern provinces. Didn't the Japanese intend to seize them for a long time, but didn't dare to implement it for a long time? Now they are openly expelling customs officials and forcibly taking over. And Mr. Wang Guangming once told the people that if the puppet state were declared established, the national government would definitely order its suppression. Who would have thought that before the blood on his lips was dry, he had already gone back on his word. The great Northeast has been allowed to fall into enemy hands. Is it not heartbreaking? Furthermore. The world only has governments that lose their country, not people who lose their country. How can our people be an exception? But who knew it would be otherwise. Recently, I read the Binjiang Times, a major newspaper in Jilin Province. After the incident, it still publishes two and a half large sheets daily. What is published in it is often extremely absurd. Although it is said that they are not free under the violence of the Japanese, when writing, they might as well avoid the important and take the light, or only record the facts, or rather not write anything. They must not take the puppet state of Manchuria as the subject before writing, regard themselves as people of the puppet state of Manchuria, and openly despise the motherland, fawning on the Japanese and their Chinese lackeys. For example, when writing about Zang Shiyi, it is enough to say Zang Shiyi. Why must it be written as Governor Zang? The Japanese will never pay attention to this, saying that they cannot directly call him by his name. For example, if it is recorded that Bao Guancheng is ill, it is enough to say that Bao Guandeng is ill. But the newspaper says that Mayor Bao's government affairs are unwell. It is inevitable that people will feel nauseous for three days. It is even more hateful that the guerrillas are generally referred to as bandits and the Japanese army is praised. As the saying goes, (Nothing is more tragic than a dead heart). There is no doubt that these journalists are already dead-hearted. And the intellectual circles in the Northeast are still so shameless. Not to mention the ordinary people. This is why we feel even more heartbroken that the government is willing to lose the Northeast. Moreover, the masthead of the newspaper prominently states the first year of Datong. The Yingkou Commercial Daily has become even more intensified. In addition to the first year of Datong, there is also the Japanese Showa era. I wonder if there is still China in the hearts of these people? Or do they regard all of China as a country that has already fallen? Alas. It's extremely heartbreaking.</p>

<p>Projectiles: Projectiles vary depending on the type of guns and cannons. Gun bullets have been described above. Now, let's briefly talk about cannon shells. Among cannon shells, field gun shells include: high-explosive shells, shrapnel shells, incendiary shells, armor-piercing shells, smoke shells, illuminating shells, gas shells, signal shells, etc. Each type of shell has a special effect. Some are used to destroy buildings, some are used to suffocate and slaughter humans and animals, and some are used to burn and poison distant positions. Generally, they are used according to the situation during combat. In addition, these projectiles are loaded with fuses that ignite and explode at the desired location and time. These fuses are also divided into instantaneous fuses, short-delay fuses, anti-aircraft fuses, and igniter fuses. Recently, to reduce air pressure in igniter fuses and improve the uneven combustion power of gunpowder, timing and electricity have been used to invent mechanical fuses and electric fuses. Furthermore, to connect the fuse and the projectile, special projectiles have been created. The idea is that when the projectile reaches a certain location, the fuse's action can ignite a portion of the special bomb installed at the bottom. This is used to spray gas. The reaction force can propel it to a great distance. This type of projectile is called a Rocket-applied shell. There are many other types, such as grape shot, chain shot, iron cylinder shot, sulfur shot, etc., too numerous to mention. Depending on the shape of the various guns and cannons and the effect of the firing, the external shape and internal structure vary accordingly. This time, the Japanese army used mostly high-explosive and incendiary shells in Zhabei. The ones dropped from the air were incendiary and armor-piercing bombs. The weight of the bombs was over two thousand kilograms and under three thousand kilograms. The ones used during the Wusong landing were smoke shells. According to eyewitnesses of this newspaper, judging from the shell casings picked up in the rubble piles in Jiangwan, Wusong, and Zhabei, the larger ones reached three hundred pounds. This is enough to prove the magnitude of the damage this time.</p>

<p>— Cheng Zhanlu</p>
<p>Why doesn't the short man speak? The passengers in the cabin already understand clearly: he can't speak; he must be a spy, he must be a foreign-made short man. This is the unquestioned answer in everyone's mind. So, the fire of patriotism blazes! A spy has infiltrated the ship. This is intolerable; he must be caught. If we want to report him, we must secretly notify the military police and have him detained.</p>
<p>One by one, they whispered to each other, using the method of ants conveying messages. Before long, the whole ship knew about it. The ship arrived at ×× Town, which it usually doesn't stop at. The captain announced that the engine needed repairs and the ship and tugboat stopped one by one.</p>
<p>A squad of water police, acting on orders, boarded the ship to inspect. First, four machine guns were aimed at the short man who was the focus of everyone's attention, ordering him to go ashore for inspection.</p>
<p>The short man calmly went ashore for inspection. The water police stripped off the short man's overcoat, and the truth came out. Inside were badges and symbols, clearly indicating that he was a propaganda officer of the ××× army. There were also official documents in his pocket. He was not a spy, nor was he a foreign-made short man. He was just a military figure going to Shanghai on official business.</p>
<p>The silent short man also spoke at this time. Listening to his speech, it was pure Cantonese, which further proved that he was indeed a domestically produced short man, not a foreign-made short man. When the water police asked him why he was silent while sitting in the cabin, causing people to suspect him? He pointed to the plaster on his right cheek, stating that he was suffering from a toothache and was reluctant to talk to people. Furthermore, he was from Guangdong, and most of the passengers on the ship were from Jiangsu and Shanghai. They asked him in their local dialects, which he couldn't understand very well, so he could only nod in response to these kinds of expressions.</p>
<p>The water police apologized to the short man and also investigated the person who reported him, saying that he should not have made something out of nothing and reported it as a serious matter, causing this misunderstanding.</p>
<p>The person who reported it couldn't help but turn pale with fright. According to the law of retaliatory punishment for false accusations, he would have to endure a lawsuit. The water police refused to let him go and insisted on taking him to the authorities. Instead, this domestically produced short man pleaded with the water police on behalf of the person who reported him:</p>
<p>"He did not intentionally slander me. I really had reasons that could make people suspicious. The fault lies entirely with my toothache. I have no complaints against the person who reported me and instead express my full admiration. If everyone were as attentive to reporting spies as the people on this ship, then the enemy's spies would definitely not dare to penetrate deep into the interior as if they were in no man's land. Although I have suffered some trouble, I have endless joy, rejoicing that people's hearts are not dead and that everyone can fulfill their duty to detect spies. I've said too much. My toothache is acting up again. Let's go ashore."</p>
<p>With a blast of the steam whistle, the small steamer moved forward again. The suspicion just now had long since vanished. The cabin was filled with a harmonious atmosphere. There was no more whispering or private discussions. Those who had given the short man dirty looks just now were now smiling at him.</p>

<p>(The investigation team will hold a grand ball tonight at 9:30 PM at the Beijing Hotel. Zhang Xueliang, Yu Fengzhi, Madame Wellington Koo, Mr. and Mrs. Shen Nengyi, and other Chinese and foreign dignitaries will attend.)</p>
<p>Yesterday, this newspaper's dispatch from Beiping had such a message. At the time, after reading this piece of news, I couldn't help but applaud and rejoice wildly.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Xueliang has always been generous and magnanimous. Apart from not avenging the murder of his father, he also casually dismisses the hatred of national and family destruction, not caring about it. He also loves peace and has always adhered to the policy of non-resistance. Therefore, Japan was able to safely and completely occupy all of the three northeastern provinces in a matter of days. Mr. Zhang Xueliang's attitude (treating hatred and favor equally) cannot but be deeply admired by anyone. Mr. Zhang Xueliang also has a well-known specialty: he is a (dancing expert). He is now a member of the Central Executive Committee. One could also say that he is a (dancing committee member). Such a title on his head can be said to be truly well-deserved.</p>
<p>I remember that when the September 18th Incident occurred in the Northeast last year, there was a great uproar in Beiping, but Zhang Xueliang could not be found. Later, he was found in a certain aristocratic ballroom, where he was holding a dance partner and performing his specialty, stepping to the rhythm of the "waltz" in the soft red and green electric lights. So some rash elements who didn't understand the ways of the world cursed him for (dancing away the nation). I say no. Even if Zhang Weilang didn't dance, how could he prevent his country from being destroyed? Dancing has wonderful uses after all.</p>
<p>(Saving the nation through dancing) is originally the newest and most fashionable term, but I never believed that dancing could save the nation. Who knew that when the League of Nations investigation team went to Japan the other day, the Japanese government welcomed them sincerely. Today they held a grand banquet, tomorrow they held a dance. Noble women each held wreaths, offering them diligently. This (gentle) diplomacy is truly breathtaking and unprecedented. Therefore, the investigation team could not refuse the Japanese government's hospitality and stayed in Japan for about two weeks. I laughed at my own dullness. The meaning of saving the nation through dancing has such a wonderful effect. Now that the investigation team has arrived in Beiping, Mr. Zhang Xueliang will naturally fulfill his duty as host and entertain them diligently, needless to say, because the investigation team's inspection is extremely important to the Dong Province issue. This time, the investigation team held a grand ball at the Beijing Hotel. This conference seems to be dominated by the investigation team in name, with Zhang Xueliang as the guest. However, Zhang Xueliang had such a banquet before, and then the investigation team also held a grand conference to respond with elegance. There is no doubt. Therefore, I think of our country's diplomacy. Other means are far inferior to Japan. Only dancing diplomacy is indeed Zhang Xueliang's specialty. The way to save the nation may lie in this. Therefore, people say that Zhang Xueliang lost the nation through dancing. I can only say that Zhang Xueliang can save the nation through dancing.</p>

<h3 id="e113">The Tale of the Difficult Chicken <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Chen'er lived on North Sichuan Road in Shanghai, less than half a mile from the former Japanese military headquarters. During the January 28th Incident this year, he fled in a panic, unable to take anything with him. At that time, there were two roosters in his residence. Before leaving, he locked them in a corner of the house, feeding them leftover grains, which were hardly enough to last them for three days. By the beginning of March, our army, in accordance with the League of Nations' resolution, withdrew its troops. Chen'er went to check on his residence after seven days. The destruction in the places he passed by was indescribable. Few of the neighboring residences were intact, but Chen'er's residence was unharmed. When he went upstairs, he suddenly heard a sound coming from the corner of the room. He quickly looked at it, thinking that even the chicken could not survive, but he still hoped that one of them would. Counting the days, it had been thirty-eight days. How amazing this chicken is! It had escaped slaughter and the flames of war, relying on a small amount of food to barely survive. As soon as it heard a human voice, it crowed. Did it know what was happening, or did it not know? Moreover, the area was so close to the war zone, and countless houses were destroyed by artillery fire. Yet Chen'er's residence was the only one spared. Perhaps it was due to the chicken's ability to endure hunger and hardship. Chen'er took it home, built a separate coop for it, intending to let it live out its days. I laughed and said, "This chicken can be called the 'difficult chicken'. We must write a tale about it." So I wrote this in the spring of the twenty-first year of the Republic of China, March.

<p>— Wei Youfang</p>
<p>Alas! O Chicken, come before me and let me speak to you. Why did you not urge the youth to dance in the middle of the night when the clouds of war first gathered? Why did you silently crouch before the window? Having experienced the fires of war for forty days, it must have been hard for you to survive alone in the dangerous building. I heard you had a companion, but where is it now? Could it be that it wished to learn from Zuo Botao, sharing its food with you and entering the tree? Or perhaps it was defeated in a fight for you, and you relied on the golden spurs of the Hou Sun chicken. After surviving the great disaster, fortune is at hand. Yesterday I heard that your master has renovated his house. He will raise you and let you live out your days. Your master is benevolent, and you are blessed.</p>

<p>— Hong Foshi</p>
<p>Fish in a pot and swallows under the eaves weep in confusion. With its spurs still intact, it escapes the enemy's atmosphere. In a Buddhist land, frightened pigeons sometimes remain. The uncivilized people are fortunately not dead, fleeing in alarm like deer. The survival of one thing is related to the mysterious number. Thousands of families sing and weep, complaining about the skinhead army. I, an old man, still get up and dance when I hear the sound. I wish to follow the flying general and plan a miraculous feat.</p>

<p>— Wu</p>
<p>Ningbo Person: You Jiangbei people are all low-class trash. Look, in Shanghai, the people who empty chamber pots and pull rickshaws are mostly you Jiangbei people. And the most kidnappers are also Jiangbei people.</p>
<p>Jiangbei Person: Bullshit! You Ningbo people are the low-class ones. We empty chamber pots and pull rickshaws, but that's (self-reliance), doing things for the Chinese. But what about you Ningbo people? Hmph, doing the bidding of foreigners, being compradors, kissing the asses of (high-nosed) foreigners, being running dogs for foreigners, that's truly low-class and shameless!</p>
<p>Ningbo Person: Don't you kiss the asses of foreigners? You're dogs of the Japanese, doing traitorous things, killing people and setting fires. Aren't those you Jiangbei people?</p>
<p>Jiangbei Person: True enough, we're traitors, but (Japanese tortoises) give money! You bidding of foreigners, usually all fancy in your Western suits, won't even give us an extra copper for pulling your rickshaws, and even try to exploit us in every way. You even sold Japanese goods while boycotting them! How do you explain that? Some Jiangbei people do traitorous things because you force them to!</p>
<p>Ningbo Person: Who told you you can't earn money? Who told you to be poor? Poor people deserve to starve to death! You're still talking as if you're justified, how shameless!</p>
<p>Jiangbei Person: Ah, that's right. You have money, so you don't dare fight the Japanese. So you try every way to sell out the country. From whatever committee chairman to the bankers, there's no one who doesn't advocate compromise with those short devils. Isn't our defeat in this war all your fellow townsmen's doing?</p>
<p>Ningbo Person: Alright, let's not talk about that for now. But our fellow townsmen have the ability to sell out the country. Do you?</p>
<p>Jiangbei Person: Hahaha! So that's how it is, then (everyone can sell the country). It's not surprising that Jiangbei people do traitorous things because they're poor. Besides, those who do traitorous things are just a few minorities. Surely not every Jiangbei person is.</p>
<p>Ningbo Person: That's good, then. Even though I'm a Ningbo person, I don't sell out the country.</p>
<p>Jiangbei Person: That's right. Even though the Japanese government is imperialist, most of the Japanese people aren't bad. What else is there to say? Hahaha!</p>

<p>— Fushi</p>
<p>Spring is balmy, the tips of branches and blades of grass are full of life! Spring also sneaks through the seams of Mr. C's home.</p>
<p>Mr. C, reclining on the sofa, winks and assigns the evening's tasks, such as finding out about land prices in Zhabei and Jiangwan, bowing his back to rush to the banquet held by XXX at the Licha Hotel, and visiting the consul of X country with a peaceful face ::::. After thinking for a while, he felt that he couldn't handle it all. So he moved the time for meeting with a certain important person to resolve national affairs to the second evening. When he smiled with his tense, fleshy black face, he was also thinking, even if the second evening is again filled with busy affairs, there is still the third evening!::::.</p>
<p>Apart from the faint sound of the Fourth Concubine cracking melon seeds, the study was as silent as a tomb. Because the eldest son had gone to XXX Bank to remit money! The second son had gone to the tea dance party at XXX Dance Hall! The third daughter, fourth daughter, second concubine, and third concubine had gone to the cinema or their favorite local places. Later, the Fourth Concubine, hearing the faint flute outside the window, turned on the recording of "The Secret History of the Xuan Palace"! One, to cover up the sound of the flute outside the window and her own rapid breathing! Two, to urge him to leave quickly. Madam C, an elderly woman, had not been in charge of their petty accounts for years. Now that they (he) had all left smelling sweet, she gathered the ladies from next door around the Guangdong rosewood table to play mahjong.</p>
<p>The second round of frenzied flute playing and the crackling sound of mahjong tiles echoed each other outside the window. The moon goddess of the spring night also sketched her face and smiled secretly in front of the window.</p>
