<p>一五、上述之法規規定、又經某項規則或赌政條例補充如左、</p>
<p>（任何費用、未經財政委員會考量並提出報告、市議會不得表决、</p>
<p>此外尙有一種保障、使市議會不至於因有未經就財政方面考量之建議、而承諾增加支出者、卽法規内常經規定、市議董個人建議、（其結果將使市議會支出增加者、應具有提交委員會考量之程式、）（註六）、</p>
<p>試就衛生委員會而論按照上節所述規則、凡關於採用公共衛生辦法之任何建議、當提交衛生委員會考量、如該委員會之報告表示贊同、則依照上文第十四節所引述之規則、關於因採納衛生委員會建議而須支出之欵、當然亦須由財政委員會報告、因此市議會得有兩層保障、使牽涉支出但其結果未經詳細研究之各項建議、不至接受、</p>

<p>一、審查工部局賬目問題、前已叙述、（註一）、並經指明、（註二）、罰地産章程雖規定、（第十二欵）（董事會之賬目、應受審查）、及（審查結果）應向常年大會宣布、但審查員之應如何選擇、如何酬報、或就任期之保障而論、其所處地位何若等、均無規定、所經注意而認爲必要者、（註三）、爲關於審查員之委任與資格、其任務之性質、及其任期之保障等、應增加規定、庶幾審查員地位之獨立、得有水久保證、</p>
<p>二、在所擬改革之計畫丙、曾提出關於此項問題之建議兩層、卽（一）審查員將來應由納税人大會選舉、且爲避免兩納税人大會（外僑與華人）對於同一人選不能同意而發生困難起見、或宜訂立一種規定、卽倘不能同意、則兩納税人大會、可分别選舉其審查員、（二）審查員之任務亦須規定、證明常年收支賑目時所須繕具之報告、其性質如何、亦須揭明、</p>
<p>三、依照現有地産章程之規定、工部局之賑目（應受審查）、此項規定、雖似向經解釋、謂工部局之賑目、應由非工部局職員、亦非爲董事會董事之有相當資格人士、獨立審查、但此種解釋之意義、在該章程内並未明白表示、故顯須明晰規定、庶不至違背向所實行之習慣、並使獨立審查之原則、亦得確定永久之承認、</p>
<p>四、此項原則之施行於公共租界、有特殊之重要關係、緣使公共機關之賬目、應由有正當人士之獨立審查、以及審查結果、應按年公布、以供衆覽之制度、在中國尙少承認、</p>
<p>五、審查公共賬目之任何制度、凡足在若干限度之内、以保證管理財政穏健與誠篤者、必須具備左列各種特色、</p>
<p>（一）審查員應具有正當資格、以履行審查之職務、該員對於賬目經其審查之官署或機關、應處於獨立地位、</p>
<p>（二）審查員應有便於進行審查之充分權力、　　（三）審查之結果應予公布、俾衆周知、</p>
<p>六、公共租界之維持此種制度、除於辦理界内事務有所裨益外、足以表示此項制度之對於一般公共行政、在實際上有何價値、（註五）、並使承認此種價値之範圍推廣、</p>
<p>七、鄙人茲擬詳論關於審查工部局賬目問題所須增訂之規定、藉以補充業經提出之建議、</p>
<p>甲、審查員之資格及其任用方法</p>
<p>八鄙人茲請建議、應訂立一種規定、使所用審查工部局賬目之人員、應爲具有正當資格之人士、旣非爲工部局董事、亦非爲工部局職員者、所謂（具有正當資格人士、）應解釋爲係指一種人員、依照其本國法律、經認爲得執行會計師及審計員之職務、且曾在上海執行此種職務滿五年者、</p>
<p>九、上文業經建議、將來之審查員、應由納税會年會選舉、舉行舉選應以投票出之、中外納税人分别舉行年會之計畫、倘經採用、則各該年會均有選舉審查員之權、設使兩種年會對於選舉同一人士爲審查員一層、不能同意、則可有審查員二人、就鄙人所知而論、此種辦法、在審查上海之公司賬目方面、固有經採用者、且除所牽涉之額外支出外、在實際方面、並無可以嚴重反對之處、</p>
<p>一○、關於由納税人大會選舉審查員一層、必須訂立一種規則、使所推舉之候補審查員名單、須於開會前若干日送交董事會、俾得有充分時間、以審查各該候捕人之資格、並將所經推舉之候補人、通知選舉人、鄙人建議、推舉之候補人名單、至少須在所定選舉審查員之開會日期三星期以前、送交董事會、此項名單、應由有規定人數之有出席納税人大會投票資格之納税人簽署、審查此項名單之任務、在於確定所經推舉之人、是否合格、此種審查、應委託董事會之委員會、或經董事會委任之審查員辦理、（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c207">定坐位 <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>如火如荼的第十届世界亞林匹克運動大會業己過去，第十一届將定於一九三六年在柏林舉行。根據柏林電訊：據説：下届運動大會，爲期雖遠；但是，各會員國向世界運動委員會在柏林預定坐位的，巳有多起。就中有美國某中學校學生購得最佳的坐位一千座。這個消息傳來，引起ＡＢ兩先生的議論；</p>
<p>Ａ先生説：美國學生的體育觀念，差不多是第二生命；一九三六年距今尙有四年之隔，他們巳鄭重其事的預購一千佳座。美國學生的世界眼光，何等遠大！美國學生對於亞林匹克的興味，何等濃厚而熱烈！</p>
<p>Ｂ先生説：見了他人，感想到自已。第十届亞林匹克運動大會，我國也是會員國之一，加入運動的，只有劉長春一人；可見國人對於世界運動的淡漠了！加入連動的，尙且這般不踴躍；預購坐位的，益發没有這麽一回事了。</p>
<p>Ｘ先生在旁聽着，便來説幾句俏皮話：</p>
<p>你們休得長他人志氣｜滅自己威風！預向亞林匹克購定坐位的我國學生，誰説没有？敝廬左鄰的三個男學生，以及右鄰的三個女學生，都曾向亞林匹克定過好多次的佳座。雖没有預購一千佳座，但是每次六座，一個月中總得預購二十餘次；他們對於亞林匹克的興味，不讓於美國學生啊｜　　ＡＢ兩先生不知他説的是俏皮話，郤向他細問根由。</p>
<p>你們不要懷疑，老實講了吧；敝鄰男女學生定的佳座，不是亞林匹克大運動會的坐位，郤是夏令配克大影戲塲的坐位；呵呵！</p>
<p>Ｘ先生笑着説。</p>

<p>㈠薦員公局林主席畢竟是一位好好先生，當他到了福州，覺到年久回鄕，無以安慰鄉人，究竟不好意思，於是便放了兩個手諭，介紹一個邵君屏任公安局督察員、林大沾任公安局廣告經理處副主任，那曉得最近公安局又解組了，聽説林主席所薦的兩員，均有不安於位之説，可惜林主席南歸中所遺留下的紀念，却不能永遠存在着！</p>
<p>㈡蜆子鹽帶魚林主席位祿雖高，可却未曾忘却鄉味，這次南歸，大過其蜆子（硬殼如蜆類者）鹽帶魚之土味，所以引得大家都相爭的把這兩件東西進貢他。因之一時蜆子居然每斤買到十個銅元，鹽帶魚每頭須價半，這也是最値得紀念的一件事。據説林主席南歸中，要算這兩件事是最偉大了，所以我們便也有一記的價値！</p>
<h3 id="c209">麻雀經 <a href="#c209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— 邱肇偉</p>
<p>｜國粹之一種｜</p>
<p>中國人喜歡賭，以賭爲消遣，爲娛樂，爲謀生術。而在這些（賭的娛樂）當中，以麻雀爲最高超，優雅，而又最普遍。在現在城市小康之家十三四歲的少女固然懂得（麻雀經），你若走進一窮僻鄕村的茶館，也一定聽見雀聲。自士大夫以至販夫走卒，男女老幼，三敎九流，你若不識麻雀，眞是何等的（屈死）｜（竹戰）（方城之戲），多麽文雅的名詞｜我無以名之，名之曰（國赌）或（國藝），以儕諸（國粹）之林，但我的意思不是提倡它。</p>
<p>聴説在某一時期，麻雀這東西曾爲西洋人所賞識，因而成批的輸出，許多人爲西洋人任麻雀指導而榮華富貴，這實在是了不得的極光榮的事情。</p>
<p>所以，中國儘管滅亡，中國的藝術，麻雀，是永遠不朽的！</p>
<p>中國人最淸閑溫雅，最講究娛樂；而中國人又頂聰是明，頂會（鬭智），麻雀這東西，眞是再適合也没有的了，中國人是天才的麻雀家。在不知幾百年前，中國人創造了麻雀，代代相傳，以至於今，發揚光大，普遍天下，這簡直與辮子小足抽大烟等有同樣偉大之處。試想吧，四個人圍着一張方桌了，再加上（觀戰者），注精會神，手眼不定，如痴如迷通宵達旦，中國人的娛樂，這是肺病狀態的象徵｜中國人澈頭澈尾是一個肺病的民族！</p>
<p>我告訴你，在（鬭智）這方面，日本人比我們的同胞就高强得多。我們的雀戰老手雖多，然而和日本人义起麻雀來，未必會不輸的。他們還有（麻雀戲高等戰術）（支那麻雀戰秘訣）等著作，而我們没有，這該是一種羞恥了吧。</p>
<h3 id="c210">談談香烟屁股 <a href="#c210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— 一中生</p>
<p>｜也算一種技術｜</p>
<p>無輪是那一個人。總要有一種吃飯的本領。假若你没有專門的技術。那就你只得餓煞。就是講到拾香烟屁股。也具有一種特殊的技能。假若你没有到高深的程度。那就是拾上一整天恐怕還得不到二角錢。據老於拾香烟屁股者告訴我。他拾香烟屁股已有十多年了。前後所拾的香烟屁股不下數十萬枝。他每天下午吃了飯。便到法租界東新橋一帶去拾。平均每二步可以拾一枝。但所得雖多。質却很壞。這大約是因爲香烟牌子｜大槪都是（聯珠牌。）（金鼠牌。）等等的緣故！</p>
<p>南至。霞飛路上。從下午起到夜半止。可説是行人不絶的。上中下三等的人都有。所以拾得的香烟屁股。也可分爲三等｜上中下。一般（買辦）（小開）往往吸未半根就棄在地上。屁股又長。烟質又好。多數全是（茄力克）（白雪包）等等。這種香烟屁股。可算是上等。一般中産階級的。大槪是吸的（美麗牌）（紅雪包）等爲中心。屁股不長不短。這種香烟屁股。可算中等。致於下流階級｜他們也要逛逛馬路開開眼界。但他們所吸的香烟。屁股又短。烟質又壞。</p>
<p>南京路是一般洋大人的集中地。尤其是日昇樓一帶。洋大人吸的香烟當然是洋香烟｜起碼要一塊錢一包。並且洋人都很闊綽。吸了幾口便丢去了。倘運道好些。每天所拾的香烟屁股。可得賣一塊多些！</p>
<p>九點鐘後。一般夜游神開始活動了。一羣羣的（上海少爺）（摩登小姐）（交際明星）都走進了這個銷魂塲所。他們没有走進以前。當然先把香烟屁股要擲在外。只須你凈守幾個鐘頭。包你滿載而歸。並且全是上等貨。</p>

<p>｜値得分紹的果樹｜</p>
<p>我是一個陶淵明的信徒·因爲我住的地方只配在農的路上走去，所以我就在農事上進行，但是進行的結果終是失敗·民國十四年的春天，我在寗波買了不少果樹回來，開始我的農事工作，我種的園是二十畝，種的果樹是一千五百株，我初種果樹的辰光，預算三年以後一定可以發財？不料到了第三年，因爲果子太小，滋味不好，所以換不來錢，這是是我第一次失敗，後來在上海買了一千株水蜜桃苗，種到第三年，結果也和上次的一樣，我受到了這兩次大失敗·那皈農的心早巳冷冰晃了。</p>
<p>前年的春天，我有個朋友，向平湖的禾豐農林場買來了幾十種果樹，他拿每種一株送我試植，我種了以後，覺得發育很好，今年纔第二年，水蜜桃巳結了很大很甜的果子，我那皈農的心，忽然又轉冷爲熱了，所以又向平湖禾豐農林塲定了二千株·預備進行我第三次的種植工作·還談這幾句來介紹給同志。（却酬）</p>

<p>這一連串的命令，又苦透了愛姑，幸虧伊記憶力很强，答應了，一壁走出來，一壁在那裏把緊要的不易瞭解的專門名詞强記着，默念着（蓮子羹），（電爐），（煤爐），到了廚房裏，幸不辱命，一一的向新來個説了，不過把（電爐）和（煤爐）對掉了，新來個實在已來了一年，朝上燉白木耳，蓮子羹，燕窩粥，成了常課，所以替伊校正了錯誤，並且説：（愛姑妹子，煤爐在這裏，你去拿沓水傢生來）。</p>
<p>（沓水傢生）！這個名詞又費伊踴躇了，大槪是面盆罷，這個容易，自己家裏也有過，不過空了幾個洞，補無可補，早換了五十張草紙了，那影象是不會幻減的。便到臥室裏，尋了一隻出來，自然又大又光滑又美麗。在同一地方，還有一隻白磁的，很深很大而日又不整齊的，不知道什麽用處，後來　機一動，猜定牠是放冷水的，急忽忽的到廚房襄，沓了來，故在而裏上，向韓大少奶説：（水來了）。</p>
<p>韓大少奶一骨碌推開了被窩，穿了拖鞋，到而裏邊，見冷水熱水都端正了，四下桌，椅，痰盂，花瓶，碗，碟，都揩洗得一塵不留，很高興的嘉奬説：（隨處留心些，倒做得出的）。愛姑聽了，十分寛心，便格外的起勁！要去整理（象牙床）上的（和合被）了。却見裏床被窩裏，還有一個大少爺瞞着，不用心，没留神，已把半條被頭掀動，瞥見一隻肉腿，急忙放手，大少爺已覺得了，翻轉身來，張開了兩隻　眼，向伊　了幾瞧，微微的一笑，不知是何緣故？愛姑竟像觸了電似的，失了感覺，後來覺得呆立在一個男子的床前，怪難爲情的，急忙走開，像眼瞧大少奶，正在洗臉，大槪没有注意到，這綫放了心。但是伊對着大少爺，總有些異感是（怕），也不是（羞），也不是什麽，總而言之，帶着三分（防）。</p>

<h3 id="c257">談言刮皮 <a href="#c257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>丨處世藝術之三丨</p>
<p>「刮皮」的名詞。不見於經傳。普通應用。大約就是「狗癟倒灶」或是「錙銖必較」之意。若狗癟倒灶的人。無論其財源若何茂盛。總不能做大市面。漢樊伷嘗爲州人設饌。比至日中。食不可得。而十餘自起此種人就呌刮皮。可知刮皮的人。不成大器。</p>
<p>大的地方算算小的地方不算不能稱爲刮皮。大的地方不算。小的地方抖亂。乃是刮皮。大的地方要算。小地方也要算。更是刮皮。</p>
<p>假定自己節儉而待人寛厚。不能算刮皮。如自待並不節儉。而待人刻薄乃是刮皮。若自待刻薄。而待人亦刻薄更是刮皮。</p>
<p>故刮皮之人。人無好感。我鄉有老媪。年七十餘。無子。資産不下三四十萬金。而箕帚之役。猶自任之。僅購一婢使用。人語之曰。太太如此富有。何自苦乃爾。曷不原諒些。老媪答曰。爾輩原諒。故一無所有。我不原諒故而有此。及老媪死。而族人爭奪財産。至纏訟不已。可知刮皮之人。原是生成苦命。即有財産。亦無非爲人守財而已。</p>
<p>現當生計問題日窘。生活程度日高之時。而復不知節儉。驕奢淫逸。天然是不對。不知節儉與刮皮異。節儉者節約自己。而刮皮者還要刮人。刮皮又與吝嗇殊。吝嗇者量小而不肯給人。刮皮者損人專以利己。</p>
<p>惟刮皮雖與節儉不同。但不應該節儉而節儉。就是刮皮。刮皮雖與吝嗇不同。然不應該吝嗇而吝嗇。亦是刮皮。故飲食有節。用財有度。處何種的境界。應用何種的排塲處何種的地位應用何種的經濟。過此多是刮皮。</p>
<p>故孔子曰。放於利而行多怨。</p>

<p>— 曉光</p>
<p>「一物不知，儒者之恥」，在現今凡百學問分業精研的時代，這句話已經失却正確性了。但是普通自然現象的常識，無論何人都是應該知道的，自然現象中與人類關係最密切者，莫如生物。一般人對於生物的見解似是而非者，不知凡幾：本文之作，就是舉出幾項這一類淺近的事實，加以說明，希望閱者諸君以此爲發端，能作更精深普遍的研究！</p>
<p>（一）腐草爲螢</p>
<p>夏夜流螢點點，飛舞於花草叢中，有如無數活動的明珠爲夜作點綴者。有時飄浮到庭前，徬徨於室内，低徊瞻顧，頗足助觀感而慰岑寂，螢是怎樣發生的？知道的人却不多：禮記月冷：「季夏之月，腐草化爲螢」本草陶注：「螢爲腐草及爛竹根所化」。這也是觀察的错誤！螢多産卵於水邊的草根上，卵極微細，亦發微光，經數次變態，始成飛蟲。古人看見螢在腐草上發生，就誤認爲腐草變成了！</p>
<p>（二）蚯蚓唱歌</p>
<p>黄昏時候，隄邊階下，有時發出一種清微漫長的鳴聲，一般人以爲這是蚯蚓發出來的，所以民間有「蚯蚓會唱山歌」，「蚯蚓吹簫蛙打鼓」的傳說。但是細考蚯蚓的身體，絶無發音的器官，那末，這鳴聲的發動者究意是誰呢？生物學家已經考究出來，那就是「螻蛄」。螻蛄俗名「土狗」·體身寸餘，褐色，有翅二對，前肢强大，善爬掘。喜就燈火，故常飛入室中。能害植物之根，這是害蟲之一種。雄蟲每於初夏的黄昏，振翅發聲，以招雌蟲。</p>
<p>（三）守宫有毒</p>
<p>守宫俗稱「壁蠟」，屬蜥蝪類，尾頗脆，斷能復生。四肢各有五趾，趾下面有一皺襞，用如吸盤，故能在牆壁及光滑的玻璃窗上爬行自如：補食蟲類，故爲有益的動物。相傳其口有劇毒，非也。有毒的是另一種「蠍」，屬蜘蛛類，體身三寸餘，青黑色，胸部有足四對，下顎一對發達如蟹螯，腹部有環節，後端狹長如尾，末有毒鈎，能螫人。日間隱伏礫下牆脚樹皮及枯葉内，夜出捕食昆蟲。此種動物大都産於温熱兩帶，子胎生，無變態。</p>
<p>㈣杜鵑啼血</p>
<p>每逢春暮夏初，麥黄椹熟，芳草萋萋，綠陰彌野的時節，深林中的杜鵑，不時發出凄婉幽鬱的鳴聲，似乎在說：「不如歸去」！反覆纒綿，動人哀思！相傳有啼血之說：</p>
<p>「杜鵑苦啼啼血不止」。！！埤雅</p>
<p>「夜啼達旦，血漬草木」。！！禽經</p>
<p>因此，墨客騷人關於悲感的事情，總用杜鵑來描寫，眞是舉不勝舉，這種啼血的誤解，實起源於觀察的不精。原來杜鵑的口是鮮紅色的，李時珍的本草綱目中也載着：「狀如雀鷂而色慘黑，口赤。」即有時被捕獲的杜鵑，嘴上偶有血跡，一定受傷所致，苦推想一切杜鵑都悲啼而出血，那就错了丨</p>
<p>（五）蜻蜓産卵變爲魚</p>
<p>「穿花蛺蝶深深見，點水蜻蜓欵欵飛。」丨丨杜甫</p>
<p>爲什麽蜻蜓要點水而飛呢？因爲要産卵在水裏。産卵處日後有小魚出現，觀察不精者遂以爲這小魚蜻蜓是的卵變成的。殊不知小魚由魚卵變成，蜻蜓的卵祇會變蜻蜓决不會變成小魚的！</p>
<p>（六）蛇有足</p>
<p>「畫蛇添足」各人都知道是不對的，可是另一方面又有人說蛇是有足的，並且說看見蛇足的人要倒運：這是觀察不精和附會所致。蛇的行動全靠肋骨和鱗筯的聯帶作用，使腹部的鱗片斜觸地面，以防後退，同時身體左右蜿曲得以前進。</p>

<h3 id="c260">閙新房是惡習麽？ <a href="#c260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— 文炳</p>
<p>人是感情的興奮的動物，至少有一部分眞理，因其如此，所以人類生活也就特别來得豐富，有意義，年中逢到節季，便要聚集吃喝，談笑，玩玩獅燈，社戲，社會國家，有了新的建樹，也就集會慶祝，更因社會愈進化，人間的縟節繁文愈甚，結婚是人生歷程中一回</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>重大事件，那得可以不慶祝！闹新房！這原是開始兩性生活的一回好事，也是增進人間眷屬感情的妙法，不但不用非議，且有提倡的必要，所以日前拜讀曉雪君的「廢除閙新房的惡習」一文，頗覺有稍加辨正的需要，</p>
<p>曉君說：「閙新房是增加新郎·新娘的感情，才有這種的舉動，我們知道以前的婚姻，是賣買式的，···所以想出閙新房的妙法，來增進他們的感情，」我覺得增進感情一點，是對的，但其發生並不是買賣式的舊制婚姻始。又說：「···小夫婦苦大家面貎相當，皮氣相苦，那你不用去閙，也會好的，反之，是越鬧越不好，」這却使我不敢同意了，我覺得舊式婚姻下面貌皮氣相苦的，固然應鬧，以更增進他們的愛戀，反之，尤應想出巧妙的鬧法，使言歸於好，藉以彌縫舊婚姻的罪惡，我們不是常見夫妻不和睦的，當父母的每去請敎術士，或是往神廟裏討什麽「和合水」給他們吃，那才無啥道理，應該廢除呢！曉君又說：「漸漸變成鬧新房是結婚時必要的舉動，報復的良機····社會惡習如此，奈何！」本席前已說過，鬧新房之所以成爲結婚時的必要舉動，是時代進化的表現、用不着懷疑與詛咒，至說那是報復的良機，未免故作危詞，是社會惡習，尤非我敢承認！曉君所舉的甲乙丙的例子，恐是虚搆，我從沒有見聞過那樣的事實。又說：「···乘酒興之餘，盡量作無意識舉動，因此新郎與賀客發生衝突，常至訴訟，···何苦呢！」這也許偶然有之，但我們豈可以偶然的歪態，去根本否認某事件的存在？至說因鬧新房以至訴訟，則吾未之聞也。「摩登結婚，木婚把「親嘴」改「Kiss」罷了　眞腐化到極點，···感情本很融洽，何必多此一舉，」我只覺得「親嘴」改「Kiss」是奴化，也不能加冠腐化二字，而且我覺得有感情的更須融洽，才使男女獲得夫妻間的無限幸福。「上海是新潮流的交流，···竟未把這些惡流的習慣冲去，不知作何解釋？」這是曉君末後的一個問題，那正因爲上海較内地更進化，所以這種習俗也更興盛，只是在「鬧」的方式上有些變異！改進，拉胡琴改接懷娥琳等罷了，而且我想將來的上海，甚至整個的社會，必還有新興的鬧新房的花樣出現。</p>

<p>— 一萍</p>
<p>某一年大病，遵醫生的吩咐，在霞飛路住了多時，這裏是幽默清靜，兩旁的小樹，平坦的大道，如其你憑靠在窗櫺上閒望，一輛汽車從那邊駛來，眞像奔上天去一般快，我往往這樣出了神，夕陽影裏，挽着手的青年男女，點綴不少異國風光，但是都市是罪惡的大集成，這像處女的霞飛路，現在已呈異樣光彩了，，不信？告訴你們一件故事：</p>
<p>星期日被朋友拉到法國公園去，道經霞飛路，在某電車站旁，立着一位美麗的姑娘，我們的視線當然被她怔懾住了，適巧接連兩輛電車駛來，但是她並不上去，朋友說，「神秘之街呵！你已喬遷到這裏了，」果然她見我們站立得太久了，不時斜眼微笑，又像害羞的低下頭去，可以說「盡誘惑之能事，」我就拉着朋友的手開步走了，過了一條短的横馬路，再返身向她站的地方一望，一個碧眼的浪人挽着她手向我們這裏走來，見我們返身望她，露出得意的笑容，好像說：低能兒！」</p>
<p>生産落後的中國，許多自負的人都舉着頭嗷嗷待哺，女子職業雖然有人高呼，但不過「紅花瓶」這一類罷了，這美麗的姑娘淪落到如此地步，我們也負着一部份職任啊！豈但是霞飛路上的汚點？</p>
<p>朋友們！認清你們的職任吧，亨受這幽默的霞飛路：</p>

<p>— 玉麟</p>
<p>「哈囉！密斯脫商！蓬萊看京戲去嗎？」一個同學站在樓下高聲地問。</p>
<p>不，我要預備攻課，我們下星期一就要考物理和歷史呢，可是我一張書也沒有翻過，老李，實不相瞞，只得改日奉陪吧！」姓商的那位同學從窗口探出頭來，直捷爽快的回絶了他。</p>
<p>「呸！這些鬼話我實在聽得慣了，人家因爲瞧得起你，所以特地來約你同去，不料竟會說出這一套的假話來，眞是······」那位同學說到這廟，氣憤塡膺，怒氣冲冲的直上他們的寢室裏。</p>
<p>聽說那位姓商的同學那時已經聽清楚這位同學跑上樓梯的脚步聲，所以慌忙將自己正在那裏寫的信，收藏到抽屜裏：但是無論怎樣，沒有這樣神速的本領。結果因爲一枝筆來不及裝進筆套裏去，就被那位同學察覺了他的確在寫信而不是在看書，於是他不由自主的拍着手大笑起來說：「噢！我知道了，原來你所謂用功，是專指練習寫××而言的，哈哈！明天我到校裏一定把你宣傳去。」</p>
<p>這麽一來，却弄得姓商的同學難爲情得面紅耳赤半名話也說不出來，最後他們倆的和約是如此：得商的允許同去戲院，其餘一位同學的宣傳亦作罷論。聽說這位姓商的臨出門時，手裏還夾着一册西洋史，預備進戲院去温習哩。」</p>

<p>— 陳大悲</p>
<p>希望中國影片能夠在世界各國影業競賽市塲上，佔一個位置，希望中國人能夠在表演藝術上顯露我們特長的種種優點來，我們目前第一步緊要工作，就是要把過去與將來，來一個一刀兩段，劃分爲兩個時期。</p>
<p>過去的十多年是我們影劇史上的模彷時期，從今日開始的將來是我們的獨創時期。</p>
<p>在美國有許多「東方迷」的批評家恭維我們是發明影戲的鼻祖。於是乎一班誇大狂的僑胞們便沾沾自喜，引以爲榮。不錯。『灤州影戲』一類的玩藝兒至今還盛行我們的北方各省。的確是發明在歐美各種影戲之先。但是，我們好意思把這此獸皮製成的五顔六色的人畜彫畫，高舉在手裏在手裏，對世界各國醉心於銀幕藝術的人們，誇耀我們中國民族是全世界首先發明影戲的鼻祖嗎？恭維我們爲發明影戲的鼻祖原是人家的謙德，我們却不可以驕天之功，硬說這一種將取黑板而代之的銀幕藝術就是我們『　州影戲』的遠房外孫·我們一翻電影發展史，看美國以及西方其他各國的研究者，對這一種藝術的貢獻，是如何的堅苦勇猛，我們便要自愧不如了。爲甚麽能夠發明『皮人影戲』的中國人，只會千百年如一日的故步自封？爲甚麽我們自己沒有把『皮人影戲』演進而爲現代的電影？我們慚愧還來不及，還好意思自誇嗎？</p>
<p>甚麽『東方賈克可根』呀，甚麽『中國李琳蓋許』呀，甚麽『中國卓别麟』呀，諸如此類的頭銜，在以前的廣告，和廣告性的批評或是新聞上，我們到處都可以看得見，我們並不覺得有甚麽羞辱包含在裏面。因爲在今日以前我們自認是在啓蒙時期。啓蒙時期是免不了模彷的。所以我們竟可以直認不諱的說，今日以前的中國影片事業完全是在模彷時期中。</p>

<h3 id="e1">America Further Strengthens its Military Again <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The competition in the Chinese market is the main trend of the Pacific situation. The evolution of facts has intensified and become a new form of covert struggle between Washington and Tokyo. Since the Washington Conference, the world's three major naval powers have temporarily agreed on a peaceful agreement (553) naval ratio, which has led to a temporary halt in the arms race and a temporary cessation of dangerous storms in the Pacific. However, although the London Conference was intended to reduce armaments, the (553) ratio was broken from then on, and Japan gained new advantages in cruisers and submarines. In addition, the Mukden Incident broke out, and the Japanese army seized our Liaoning and Jilin provinces in a short period of time. Peace in East Asia was completely destroyed, and the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact were trampled upon. Japan used the excuse of (exercising the right of self-defense) to carry out its militaristic aggression. Britain and France both adopted a wait-and-see attitude, and the League of Nations discussed but did not decide, and made resolutions that could not be implemented. Although the United States had the intention to uphold the treaty and made empty promises, it did not use its strength to stop it, thus further increasing Japan's arrogance. After the January 28th Incident, it even created a (Manchukuo puppet state), with the ambition to encompass North China and dominate the Far East.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is actively preparing for war. The military expenditure in the next year's budget accounts for more than 50% of the total, which is a wartime budget that even Japan itself does not deny. The army and navy factories are working day and night. Throughout Japan, the whole country is filled with a wartime atmosphere. The military industries along the coast of the Seto Inland Sea, from Shimonoseki and Moji to Kure naval port, Kobe, Osaka, and Yawata in Kyushu, are obvious. Even chemical plants (such as sulfuric acid plants and calcium cyanamide fertilizer plants) that have some relationship with the military are also militarized at the same time. Major cities and military port fortresses are actively expanding air defense facilities, and air warfare exercises are conducted from time to time, as if a great war is about to come. However, after the setbacks in the disarmament conference, Germany has been making every effort to advocate equality in armaments. Then, the balance of power on the European continent will not be maintained, and Britain and France will have no choice but to coordinate to restrain Germany. At the same time, it is inevitable to impose some kind of restraint on Japan, which is rampant in East Asia! ! At least, it must be given a more effective threat in order to maintain the credibility of the League of Nations and maintain the centrifugal tendencies of various small countries. Therefore, after the publication of the Lytton Report, Britain, France, and the United States all expressed their support and wanted to break Japan's monopoly through international common agreements. At the beginning of the publication of the report, the Japanese warlords all wanted to kick it over, thinking that the report of the investigation team was just a travelogue, and what practical value was there to talk about. Later, the international situation changed day by day, and those who favored Japan became increasingly fewer. Even France hinted that it could not help Japan monopolize the Northeast. Therefore, Japan was in diplomatic isolation. The Soviet Union's (ironic observation) made the rule of Manchuria unable to rest easy. The competition with the United States across the Pacific Ocean caused the Japanese mainland to feel threatened. Although China is weak, its determination to fight against the enemy is deeply rooted and unshakable. If Japan loses the assistance of Britain and France, it will inevitably fall into an extremely difficult situation in a war with the United States. Therefore, it shows goodwill to the Soviet Union in order to alienate the relationship between Britain, the United States, and France, and create a favorable environment for Japan. It changed from (the theory of withdrawing from the League of Nations) to (the theory of earnestly explaining to the League of Nations) and hinted that (Manchuria) will implement (the open door policy), especially welcoming British and French investment to reorganize the diplomatic lineup, putting our country in a passive position and trapping the United States in isolation.</p>
<p>The United States of America is indeed unable to do what it wants on the Far East issue due to the limitations of its geographical location and the situation. However, capitalism has reached its peak, and all markets in the world have been divided. With the huge production equipment of the United States, how can it not strive for overseas markets? It cannot relax a step in the development of the Far East. Otherwise, the United States is no different from destroying its own life. Although Americans are extremely cautious, they are afraid that there will eventually be a day when they cannot tolerate it. The speed of the evolution of facts is beyond our expectations. On October 26, President Hoover issued a statement on the U.S. Navy Memorial Day, the gist of which is as follows:</p>
<p>(The American people support their national rights and often use peaceful means instead of resorting to force. Therefore, the American government proposes to the people of all countries to further reduce armaments by one-third on the basis of the disarmament agreement of the London Treaty. This proposal is currently under negotiation. This effort of the American government is by no means to put American security in danger. If these efforts unfortunately fail, the world's security will be threatened. Therefore, in self-defense and to protect American commerce, we cannot but rush to build the world's number one naval power in accordance with the provisions of the London Treaty. As a result, it will not only increase the enormous burden on the American people, but also seriously damage the American people's hope for peace...) said.</p>
<p>Although the above statement is euphemistic and peaceful, it is actually the first response to Japan's militaristic aggressive policy. Before this, although there were exhortations to China and Japan and Stimson's repeated statements (the doctrine of (non-recognition of gains from aggression)), how could it actually stop Japan's military actions in the slightest? After the Japanese cliques occupied the Northeast, they possessed abundant resources. If the domination of the West Pacific coast inevitably falls into the hands of Japan, how can the United States stand by and watch the vast market being invaded by others? This is why it has to rise up in time. If the Northeast issue remains unresolved in the future (Japan will monopolize it, and the great powers will share the benefits), and the reduction of armaments falls into a stalemate again, and the United States starts building ships, and Britain and Japan will inevitably compete more fiercely, then the rift will deepen, and the final settlement will only have to wait for the cleansing of artillery fire and poison gas.</p>

Military Force is Too Strong. For Every Point the Military Men Increase in Strength, the People Increase in Pain. Although There are Many Stopgap and Fundamental Measures, it is Still Difficult to Curb Their Ambitions and Put Politics on the Right Track. The Reason for This is that Sichuan's Terrain is Conducive to Partition and the Government has Worries About Being Too Far Away. Only by Actively Developing Transportation and Completing the Sichuan-Hankou Railway as Soon as Possible Can the Government's Strength Reach Sichuan and Those who Rely on Military Force Will be More Easily Sanctioned by the Government.

He emphasized that he had previously denounced restoration, expelled Puyi, overthrown warlords, and opposed dictatorship, so how could he today engage in the absurdity of supporting Duan Qirui and restoration? Regarding Chapter Two of the Lytton Report, which mentions the revolutionary events in the capital and states that Feng Yuxiang betrayed his superior, if overthrowing the bribery-ridden government and expelling remnants of the imperial system with Sun Yat-sen is considered betraying a superior, then all revolutionaries are subject to such accusations, and the government born of the National Revolution would have no basis for legitimacy. This matter concerns the National Government's international standing, and he hopes that Luo Wengan will refute it.</p>

Luo Binghui led the pseudo-Fifth Army Corps and the 22nd Army as the right wing, looting Tai Ning and Shaowu. Lin Biao's pseudo-First Army Corps concentrated in Jianning in the central route.

<p>Lieutenant General Nagano Carries New Proposal to Geneva</p>
<p>Intends to Demand Cancellation of the 5:5:3 Naval Ratio</p>
<p>Especially Opposed to the Abolition or Reduction of Submarines</p>
<p>England Intends to Propose Restrictions on World Air Force</p>
<p>Pengo Explains Security Plan at Executive Meeting</p>
<p>Reuter's, Tokyo, 4th – The contents of Japan's newly drafted maritime disarmament plan remain secret. Whether it is a completely clear plan, such as that proposed by President Hoover, or merely detailed instructions to guide Japanese representatives in Geneva, is still unknown. However, one thing is certain: Japan's new plan overturns both the disarmament plan proposed by the U.S. President and that announced by British Cabinet member Baldwin. This is evident from the statements made by the Japanese government spokesperson. The spokesperson stated that if the Japanese thought the British or American plans could serve as a basis for compromise, Japan would not submit a new proposal. Fundamentally, Japan's views on maritime disarmament have not changed, but details have been slightly altered as a result of the opinions presented by Vice Admiral Nagano after returning to Japan from Geneva. Since the fundamental points of Japan's position have not changed, it can be inferred that Japan's new proposal will naturally include: 1. Reduction of battleship tonnage and gun caliber; 2. Reduction or abolition of aircraft carrier tonnage; 3. Abolition of aerial bombardment, poison gas, and germ warfare; 4. Restrictions on the use of submarines, but opposition to their abolition; 5. Demand for an absolute minimum ratio of 70% for Japanese naval armaments compared to those of Britain and the United States. Japan needs many smaller warships, rather than a few large warships, to protect its trade routes, which is the same as Britain's situation. However, Japan considers submarines to be essential for national defense, which is different from Britain's view. Japan values submarines because it believes they can prevent aircraft from approaching its coast. Reuter's, Tokyo, 4th – Japanese representative to the Disarmament Conference, Nagano, is scheduled to depart tonight, traveling via Siberia to Geneva. It is expected that after he arrives, Japan's new disarmament proposals will be announced. The nature of Japan's proposals has not yet been revealed, but it is widely believed that they will neither reject nor accept President Hoover's plan for substantial disarmament. Japan's intention is that its proposals will be submitted alongside those of President Hoover and Baldwin as a completely separate plan, aiming to reduce (aggressive armaments). Based on recent developments, Japan is preparing to receive the French proposals previously submitted by Tardieu as a basis for negotiation. However, Japan intends to seek the cancellation of the 5:5:3 ratio between Britain, the United States, and Japan, as Japan considers this impractical and unfair.</p>
<p>Reuter's, London, 4th – The Daily Mail anticipates that Britain will put forward a grand disarmament proposal with far-reaching implications for the world's air forces. The newspaper reported that the basis of this plan is: 1. Complete abolition or a major reduction of all bombing and fighter aircraft worldwide; 2. Placing all commercial airlines under the management of an international organization; 3. Limiting the number of privately owned aircraft in each country and establishing ratios for them. The newspaper also heard that the Cabinet has not yet fully agreed on this proposal, but it is expected to gain widespread support under the leadership of Foreign Secretary Simon. The Huibao newspaper also stated that the British government may advocate international management and restrictions on the aviation industry, and that Foreign Secretary Simon will make an announcement of (very practical) nature in Geneva next week. The general public is now optimistic, believing that genuine steps will soon be taken to move closer to disarmament.</p>
<p>Havas, Geneva, 3rd – During the plenary session of the Disarmament Conference this afternoon, Chairman Henderson announced that 47 countries have given affirmative responses regarding the extension of the (Disarmament Truce) for four months. He believed that if there were no objections, the (Armaments Truce) would be considered extended. French representative Massigli stood up and stated that when France responded to the request to extend the (Armaments Truce), it had stated that France could only agree if all its neighboring countries were willing to implement the truce. However, at least one country bordering France has not yet responded to this matter. Therefore, the French representative felt compelled to specifically mention the situation arising from this matter.</p>
<p>Reuter's, Geneva, 3rd – American representative to the Disarmament Conference, Gibson, stated today that the United States is prepared to support a permanent committee to supervise disarmament, provided that the final treaty includes a satisfactory disarmament plan in accordance with President Hoover's principles. Reuter's, Geneva, 4th – The Disarmament Conference convened today with a large attendance. French representative Pengo explained France's new disarmament plan for an hour and ten minutes. Pengo frequently cited President Hoover's proposals, praising them and stating that they were the basis of the French plan. He particularly welcomed Secretary of State Stimson's principle of increasing the defensive strength of the world while reducing offensive strength. He also stated that the French plan is based on the principle of concentric circles. The first circle involves countries that have signed the Kellogg-Briand Pact renouncing war. The second circle involves countries that have signed the League of Nations Covenant. The third circle is the smallest and most important, concerning European countries that are mutually linked by reciprocal or equal interests. This principle can form a convention of mutual assistance. Countries in these three circles may retain the necessary troops to defend their borders or resist the initial attacks of aggressors, but their troops can serve the League of Nations and can be used to assist countries that have been invaded. At the same time, an international and powerful air force should be established to serve the League of Nations in order to provide rapid and effective assistance to countries that have been attacked. The inner circle of the above three circles is limited to European countries, excluding Britain and the United States. Countries signing this agreement must unify their defense systems, taking into account the size of their populations and other special needs. Armaments and weapons must also be standardized. France is prepared to genuinely reduce its armaments and agrees to standardize its conscription system and reduce training periods, so as to not only reduce the offensive power of each country but also delay mobilization, giving the League of Nations more time to organize deterrent action. In summary, France's plan includes: 1. Large-scale, gradual disarmament; 2. Maintaining a limited standing army for national defense and for service to the League of Nations; 3. Reducing the number of troops and the duration of training.</p>
<p>Reuter's, Geneva, 4th – Pengo's arguments were well-received, especially by the American representatives. Although the Germans did not attend, the German newspapers supported his proposal for conscription, believing that the French proposal could serve as a basis for seeking equality in armaments. However, Pengo's mention of "special needs" was seen by many as potentially causing disputes, as it likely referred to the needs of colonies.</p>

<p>Havas, Paris, 3rd – The Qingyi Bao here has received news from Milan, Italy, stating that German Defense Minister Schleicher secretly visited Italy. The news is said to be highly reliable and includes the following details: (Several weeks ago, German Defense Minister General Schleicher secretly traveled to Italy to meet with Prime Minister Mussolini and Army Chief General Chazzara. All possible international incidents were considered by both sides, but no written agreement was reached. During the same period, Mussolini also arranged to meet with a prominent French opposition figure in Bolzano, Italy, under similar secret conditions as the meeting with Schleicher. The intention was to conceal or diminish the importance of the meeting between Mussolini and Schleicher. However, the French figure was unknowingly exploited.)</p>
<p>Reuter's, Madrid, 3rd – The purpose of French Prime Minister Herriot's visit to Spain is still not fully known. Government officials, when referring to the matter, stated that France and Spain have shaken hands in broad daylight. Today, a certain newspaper claimed that, according to a high-ranking figure in diplomatic circles, Herriot emphasized the Balearic Islands in his discussions. Italy has already set its sights on these islands, but now that France and Spain have openly united to maintain peace, the islands, with appropriate defensive works, should be able to eliminate the danger of being attacked. Havas, Madrid, 3rd – Foreign Minister Xu Luda issued a statement saying, (The friendship between France and Spain is open and aboveboard, and no secret negotiations have taken place. Prime Minister Herriot's visit has nothing to do with war. The purpose is to uphold the inherent provisions of the national constitution.)</p>

<p>National News Agency, Moscow, 3rd – Japanese representative to the League of Nations, Matsuoka Yosuke, and his entourage arrived here at 9 p.m. today. Matsuoka denied to the Associated Press reporter that he would negotiate a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union or recognize the Manchurian puppet organization, but said that he would meet with Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov for informal talks of a private nature. He added that he might personally agree to such a treaty. Matsuoka claimed that the world and journalists of various countries were placing too much importance on his short stay in Moscow. A correspondent from the New York Herald Tribune even traveled a long distance to meet him, asking whether he would be negotiating a non-aggression treaty and urging the Soviet Union to recognize (Manchukuo) while passing through Moscow. He told them that his only task for this trip was to attend the League of Nations Assembly and that he had not been ordered to negotiate directly with the Russian government. However, in Moscow, he would discuss these issues informally in his private capacity. He hoped to meet with Stalin, but not for negotiations. He would inquire about the reasons for the Soviet Union's non-recognition of (Manchukuo), but this was not negotiation. He also said that he would issue a formal statement upon arriving in Geneva, outlining Japan's attitude towards the Lytton Report. He planned to spend a day in Berlin en route, and the Japanese Ambassador to France, Nagaoka, would also join him halfway for the trip to Geneva. National News Agency, Moscow, 4th – Matsuoka Yosuke visited Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov this morning to informally discuss various issues in Russian-Japanese relations. Since it was a private conversation, both sides were able to speak freely and frankly, which is expected to greatly help pave the way for future formal negotiations. It is said that the two sides also had a free discussion on the fundamental issue of the Manchurian puppet organization. Matsuoka elaborated on Japan's attitude in Manchuria, solemnly declaring to the Soviet Union that Japan's actions were opening the way to lasting peace in the East. It is expected that Litvinov, upon hearing these words, will certainly understand. After leaving the Soviet Foreign Commissariat, Matsuoka was accompanied by senior Russian officials to meet with Kalinin. In the afternoon, he will have a long talk with Deputy Foreign Commissar Karakhan to discuss Russian-Japanese issues in detail. It is said that they will discuss the Soviet Union's relationship with the puppet organization, as well as a Russian-Japanese non-aggression treaty and expanding trade relations between the two countries. This afternoon, the Japanese Embassy hosted a reception for Matsuoka and his entourage, inviting senior Russian officials and foreign journalists to attend. The Russian Foreign Commissariat will host a banquet for the guests at the National Theater tonight. It is said that Matsuoka and his entourage are scheduled to leave Moscow tomorrow evening.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Japan Is Clearly Positioning Itself as the Master of East Asia <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Diplomatic Shift to a New Policy</p>
<p>Comments Abound in Geneva</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 3rd – It is now recognized here that the Japanese representative's trip to Geneva to formally discuss the Lytton Report shows that Japanese diplomacy has adopted a new policy, shifting from defending the Japanese army's actions in Manchuria to positioning itself as the protector of East Asian peoples. Although the Japanese version of the (Asian Monroe Doctrine) has not yet been formally declared, observers of the situation expect to hear phrases such as (the white man's burden) at this conference. However, at a time when the oldest and wisest empire builder (i.e., Britain) is consoling itself by relinquishing its rule over Iraq, the fact that the Japanese still want to shoulder the burden of imperialism is truly astonishing to observers here. Recently, Japanese Army Minister Araki Sadao published an article in a Japanese magazine, stating that there is no denying that East Asian countries are oppressed and mistreated by white people, and that Japan should no longer sit idly by. This clearly shows that Japan's foreign policy has shifted from solely protecting its vast interests in Manchuria to an East Asian Monroe Doctrine. Those criticizing Japan's policies here say that the Japanese phrase (Asia for Asians) is equivalent to (Asia for the strongest nation in Asia). This shows that Japan's ambition to invade the East Asian continent is already known throughout the world. Therefore, those in Geneva who oppose Japan say that the Japanese have forgotten the European War, when they interfered in European affairs and obtained a secret understanding from the Allied Powers to acquire German-owned islands in the Pacific. The Japanese now regard the German-owned islands in the Pacific as being firmly locked into the European political system, and they cannot abandon these delegated islands without first overstepping the boundary of European interference.</p>

<p>Cabinet Resigns En Masse</p>
<p>National News Agency, Belgrade, 3rd – The Yugoslavian cabinet resigned today due to the upcoming opening of parliament. The cabinet was formed in January 1929 and implemented dictatorial politics, attempting to create a centralized government, but it only increased unrest in the Croatian provinces. To date, other farmers have openly betrayed the government. King Alexander of Yugoslavia, realizing the failure of the dictatorial government, recently ordered the cessation of centralization and reconvened parliament. As soon as the news of the cabinet's resignation was announced today, countless people gathered in front of the palace, cheering and celebrating, supporting the king. Large groups of students marched through the streets, shouting "Down with (Prime Minister Jevtić)". It is expected that Yugoslavia will gradually return to parliamentary democracy in the future. The most vocal successor to the prime minister is currently Ambassador to Germany Belojevic.</p>

<p>Under the Instructions of the Third International</p>
<p>Reuter's, London, 4th – A shocking incident of Soviet government-instigated unrest in England was revealed at the Bow Street Magistrates' Court today. A man named Ellis, said to be the head of the National Unemployed Workers' Movement, was charged with inciting Hamilton and Llewellyn to incite the public to disturb public order. According to the prosecutor's opinion, the organization of unemployed people traveling to London was caused by this movement. Defendant Ellis had apparently acted under the instructions of the Third International in Russia in September. He sent a letter from Moscow, delivered by a special messenger to England, to Llewellyn or Hamilton. This letter was seized by the police during a search of the National Unemployed Workers' Movement office on November 1st. The letter stated that he was conveying instructions from a Soviet agency named Bolafit, and explained how to treat the police. The letter also mentioned the need to provoke public clamor and demand the removal of the police chief, as well as suggestions for organizing short-term strikes and demanding the abolition of asset testing. In addition, there were measures to make trade union branches hold demonstrations. The letter also criticized England for not sending news to the Soviet Union in a timely manner, so that he could not explain anything to his comrades. The letter was signed with what was definitely Ellis' handwriting. The defendant is currently being held in custody, and the magistrate stated that the case was of great importance and that the defendant should not be released on bail.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Berlin Transport Strike <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Incited by Extremists</p>
<p>Official Announcement Orders Resumption of Work</p>
<p>Reuter's, Berlin, 3rd – Berlin transport workers are on strike in opposition to wage cuts, disrupting traffic. This morning, tens of thousands of people walked to their offices in the rain. All trams, trains, and underground trains have completely stopped running. The excitement of the election situation was obscured by this strike. Those who can get an old-fashioned car or bicycle to walk can be called lucky. Only the trains in Berlin are still running, and they are extremely crowded. The strike is composed of the National Socialist Party and the Communist Party. Many workers were forced to stop working. The National Socialist Party calls this strike legitimate and points to it as the starting point for a larger strike soon. The Communist Party is also happy to deal with it. Strikers demolished tram tracks, broke glass windows, and expelled drivers, so the trams could not run. Although the workers are currently unwilling to sign a solution, it is generally expected that the dispute will be resolved soon.</p>
<p>Reuter's, Berlin, 4th – The Berlin transport wage issue has been ruled by the government arbitrator to reduce the hourly wage by two pfennigs. The transport company has formally accepted it, but although the union leaders have not approved this strike, they may not be able to agree to it soon. If so, the government will intervene, as this ruling has a binding effect on both parties. At the same time, fifty-two members of the Revolutionary Transport Strike Committee have now been arrested for not only advocating continued strikes but also inducing gas, electricity, and water workers to take sympathy strikes. Another dispatch states that the government arbitrator announced that transport work must be restored from 2:00 p.m. today. Further strikes will be illegal, and those who do not return to work at that time will be dismissed. After this announcement was issued, it is hoped that the Berlin strike will subside. At the same time, police have arrested about a hundred strike pickets and closed two Communist Party newspapers that were inciting riots. Political rallies for various parties regarding the election are still being held in various parts of Berlin today, and are not suspended due to traffic difficulties. Police and strikers exchanged fire at a tram station, resulting in the death of one striker. There was no other bloodshed.</p>

<p>Yesterday I met with the Soviet authorities to discuss Russian-Japanese issues informally.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Moscow, 3rd - Matsuoka Yosuke, the Japanese representative to the League of Nations, and his party arrived here at 9 pm today. Matsuoka denied to the Associated Press reporters that he would negotiate a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union or recognize the Manchu puppet organization, but he said that he would meet with the Soviet Foreign Affairs Commissioner Litvinov for informal contacts in a private capacity, and that he might personally agree to this treaty. Matsuoka said that people and journalists from all over the world have overemphasized Yu Xia's stay in Moscow, and even the correspondent from the New York Tribune came to welcome Yu and asked if he would be negotiating a non-aggression treaty and persuading the Soviet Union to recognize (Manchukuo) while passing through Moscow). Yu said that his only job in this trip is to attend the League of Nations General Assembly and has not been ordered to directly negotiate with the Russian government, but while in Moscow, Yu will discuss these issues in his private capacity, and he hopes to meet with Stalin, but not for negotiations. Yu will ask the Soviet Union why he has not recognized (Manchukuo), but this is not a negotiation. He also said that Yu will issue a formal statement after arriving in Geneva, stating Japan's attitude towards the Lytton report. On the way, he plans to stay in Berlin for one day, and Japanese Ambassador to France Nagaoka will also be late and travel to Geneva together. National Fourth Moscow Telegraph This morning, Matsuoka Yosuke visited Soviet Russian Foreign Affairs Minister Litvinov to discuss various issues related to Russian-Japanese relations informally. Because it was a private conversation, both parties were able to talk frankly and openly. It is expected that this will greatly help to open the way for future formal negotiations. It is said that the two countries also had a free discussion on the basic issue of the Manchu puppet organization. Matsuoka elaborated on Japan's attitude in Manchuria, and solemnly declared to the Soviet Union that Japan's actions were opening the way to permanent peace in the East. It is expected that Litvinov will fully understand after hearing these words. After leaving the Soviet Foreign Affairs Commissioner's Office, Matsuoka was accompanied by senior Russian officials to meet with Kalinin. In the afternoon, he will have a long conversation with Deputy Foreign Affairs Commissioner Karakhan to discuss Russian-Japanese issues in detail. It is reported that he will talk freely about the Soviet Union's relationship with the puppet organization, as well as the Russian-Japanese non-aggression treaty and expanding commercial relations between the two countries. This afternoon, the Japanese Embassy hosted a reception for Matsuoka and others, and invited Soviet Russian dignitaries and foreign journalists to attend.

<p>Diplomatic Change to a New Policy</p>
<p>Comments Adding to Geneva</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 3rd - It is now recognized here that the Japanese representative's trip to Geneva to formally discuss the Lytton Report shows that Japanese diplomacy has changed to a new policy, from defending the Japanese army's operations in Manchuria to positioning itself as the protector of East Asian nations. Even though the Japanese (Asian Monroe Doctrine (has not been formally declared, observers of the current situation are expected to hear phrases such as (the heavy burden of the yellow race (however, while the oldest and smartest empire builder (ie Britain) is consoling itself by removing its right to rule Iraq, the fact that the Japanese still want to bear the heavy burden of imperialism is truly astonishing to observers here. Recently, Japanese Minister of War Araki Sadao published an article in a Japanese magazine, stating that it cannot be denied that East Asian countries are oppressed and mistreated by the white race, and that Japan should no longer sit idly by. This clearly shows that Japan's foreign policy has changed from solely protecting the vast interests of Manchuria to the East Asian Monroe Doctrine. Critics of Japanese policy here say that the Japanese saying (Asia for Asians) is equivalent to (Asia for the strongest nation in Asia). From this, it can be seen that Japan's ambition to invade the East Asian continent is already known to the world. Therefore, those in Geneva who oppose Japan say that the Japanese have almost forgotten the interference in European affairs during the European War, when they obtained a secret understanding from the Allied countries to acquire German islands in the Pacific. The Japanese now view the German islands in the modern Pacific as being firmly locked into the European political system, and they cannot abandon the delegated islands without first overstepping the boundary of European interference.</p>

Inspection Circumstances: The troops to be inspected arrived at the scene at 7:00 AM. At 9:30 AM, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, accompanied by He Jian, arrived at the scene. Amidst the melodious military music, they ascended the inspection platform, and the inspection commenced. Under the command of Li Jue, all officers and soldiers first circled the grounds once and paid their highest respects to Chiang. This was followed by a marching review and a demonstration of close-order drill by the companies. The officers and soldiers demonstrated precise footwork, which was highly praised by Chiang. Next, the Technical Brigade demonstrated group exercises, including five items: linked fists, basic fists, Tongbei Fist, splitting knife, and bayonet thrusting. Subsequently, the National Martial Arts Training Institute performed group calisthenics, which were all impressive. At the same time, the Aviation Office dispatched three aircraft, which circled the sky, flying around the inspection grounds ten times, sometimes together, sometimes dispersed, sometimes high, sometimes low, and also performed aerial combat.</p>
<p>Performing National Martial Arts: At approximately 11:00 AM, after the troop inspection was completed, instructors from both the Technical Training Brigade and the National Martial Arts Training Institute demonstrated national martial arts.

Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek greatly praised the performance and especially commended the young instructor Shen Jingming and the female instructor Yan Fengying.</p>
<p>Chiang's Admonition: After the martial arts performance, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek ordered the officers and soldiers present to assemble in front of the stage for an address. He stated, in essence, that the violent Japanese had forcibly occupied our Northeast Three Provinces, and the country was now at a critical juncture of survival. In the past, the people of Hunan, such as Zeng, Zuo, Huang, and Cai, had all made significant and earth-shattering contributions to saving China from danger, earning the respect of the entire country. The Fourth Route Army, under the leadership of Commander-in-Chief He, was composed of Hunanese. At this time of national crisis, it was hoped that they would carry forward the spirit of the Hunanese of the past, defeat Japanese imperialism, and save China from danger. Having just witnessed the martial arts performance, we should understand that the reason martial arts can be effective in combat is because of the speed and precision of the movements. The same principle applies to the military in order to win battles. It is hoped that the Fourth Route Army, as the armed force of the people, will ensure that every movement is swift and precise, becoming a national model army.</p>
<p>The Troops Cheer: After Chiang's address, the officers and soldiers present were energized and cheered in support of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's efforts to resist Japan and suppress bandits, shouting slogans such as "Long live Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek!", "Long live the Chinese Kuomintang!", and "Long live the Republic of China!" The meeting was then adjourned.</p>
<p>After the adjournment, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, accompanied by his wife, traveled by car from the province to Mount Heng at 12:00 PM. He Jian and his wife, as well as Liu Jianxu, Chen Cheng, Wang Dongyuan, Li Jue,</p>
<p>Chen Guangzhong, Tao Guang, Peng Zairen, members of the Provincial Party Headquarters and the Provincial Government, and prominent figures from all walks of life, also followed in approximately 20 cars. They were expected to arrive at Mount Heng around 6:00 PM and planned to spend three days touring the mountain. They would descend the mountain on the fourth day. Tents were brought by plane from Lushan, and Chiang and Song planned to camp overnight at Zhurong Peak on Mount Heng in order to watch the sunrise the following morning. (November 2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e97">Anhui Rice Merchants Oppose Excessive Taxes <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: The Anhui Provincial Government has specially established a Rice and Grain Management Bureau to collect a rice export tax of 6 jiao per dan. The people of Anhui have already risen up in opposition. Recently, the Wuhu Business Tax Office, citing Article 5 of the revised Business Tax Regulations of the province, decided to order all rice firms to withhold 0.4% of the business tax from merchants starting October 1st, with the office sending personnel to collect it daily. The rice merchants had strongly protested the levying of business tax on rice and grain last year, but the issue was not resolved. Now, it has suddenly been increased threefold (the original tax last year was set at 0.1%), which is difficult to accept. Moreover, the price of rice in Anhui Province this year is lower than in other provinces, which is due to the excessive tax collection by the provincial government.

<p>Country knows that cheap grain hurts farmers and is jointly planning relief measures, the authorities in this province are instead increasing taxes on rice and grain, hindering its circulation, which is tantamount to abandoning farmers. In addition to notifying the rice industry associations of Guang, Chao, Yan, and Ning to work together to fight for relief, today they also wired the Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce, requesting that it immediately forward the message to the Anhui Provincial Government and the Business Tax Bureau, as well as the Rice and Grain Export Management Committee, to abolish the excessive taxes in order to alleviate the suffering of merchants.

<h3 id="e99">Bengbu Huai Salt Competitive Operation Dispute <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Transportation Merchants Establish North Salt Public Business Office</p>
<p>Salt Firms Fear Loss of Livelihood and Vigorously Oppose</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: Northern Anhui is a distribution area for Huai salt, traditionally managed by merchants for transportation and sale, unlike the salt transportation system in southern Anhui, which allows for free trading. Since the development of salt transportation by train in Bengbu, all industries have flourished, and the number of salt firms has increased to 57. These salt firms all hold long-term (ten-year) salt brokerage licenses issued by the Department of Finance, acting as intermediaries, collecting a commission of 1 jiao 9 fen per dan (the firms actually receive 9 fen, with the remainder going to local surtaxes and the salt industry association). Recently, the Huaibei Salt Affairs Inspection Sub-office suddenly issued a notice stating that Bengbu Huai salt was being sold at discounted prices, causing great instability. The main reason was the manipulative practices that led to significant disputes, which required strict measures to stabilize salt administration. Subsequently, the sale of salt in Bengbu should be managed by transportation merchants who would display salt samples for public viewing and purchase, with all salt firms treated as ordinary buyers, unable to force transportation merchants or households to trade on their behalf, to prevent corruption. At the same time, transportation merchants such as Zhang Xian'gen established the North Salt Public Business Office in Furunli to assess salt quality and set prices, declaring that no commissions would be charged, resembling the former Huai Salt Price Stabilization Bureau. As a result, the 57 salt firms became greatly alarmed, believing that this move by the transportation merchants would deprive them of their livelihoods, and they opposed it fiercely. The Salt Industry Association convened an emergency meeting of representatives from all salt firms on the afternoon of the 1st, resolving to send Yang Yaonan and others to Beijing to petition. Today (the 3rd), they gathered salt industry workers and related labor groups, holding a large-scale demonstration. At 10:00 AM, they gathered at the Transportation Association, with about 3,000 participants, marching and shouting slogans such as "Abolish the North Salt Public Business Office," heading to the Fourth Division Headquarters, Fengyang County Government, Bengbu Garrison Headquarters, Changhuai Water Police Bureau, Bengbu District Party Headquarters, and the Huaibei Inspection Sub-office's tax collection office to petition. They dispersed around 2:00 PM. This dispute is unlikely to be resolved soon. (November 3rd)</p>
<h3 id="e100">Zhang Hanying Discusses His Impressions of Inspecting the Yellow River <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Ministry of Interior's Water Conservancy Commission specially appointed Wang Yingyu to inspect the entire Yellow River to plan a comprehensive governance strategy. Wang arrived in Jinan in the middle of last month, first inspecting the lower reaches of the Yellow River's entry into the sea at Lijin. After returning to Jinan, he went to the upper reaches for inspection. Zhang Lianjia, director of the River Affairs Bureau, specially assigned the engineering section chief Pan Fen to accompany him. Zhang Hanying, president of the Jinan Engineering Society, also accompanied them. Zhang Hanying has now returned to Jinan. I asked him about the itinerary along the river. Zhang said that a month ago, they departed from Jinan, first arriving at Shilibu, and then went upstream the next day, entering Puyang and Dongming in Hebei Province, passing through Kaocheng and arriving in Kaifeng, Henan. On the second day in Kaifeng, they inspected the Jialu River in Zhuxian Town, because the river is also a tributary of the Yellow River and had been recently dredged and repaired by the Henan Provincial Government. They inspected it in great detail. On the third day, they went to Chenqiao, north of Kaifeng, to inspect a section of alkaline land, about five or six li from north to south and over twenty li from northeast, unsuitable for planting. Recently, the Henan Provincial Government planned to divert Yellow River water to silt it up in order to encourage people to cultivate it. Wang Committee member (Yingyu) deeply approved of the proposal. From there, they went upstream to Wuzhi County and Meng County. They originally planned to go to Gong County, but because it was difficult to travel by car, they changed to a train and went to Luoyang first, inspecting the Luo River in Luoyang. The river's irrigation capacity is very large, benefiting many farmlands. However, the Luo River is lower than the Yellow River, and when the water is high, it cannot discharge into the Yellow River, often causing backflow and flooding. This is one problem. Luoyang has the Beimang Mountains, where the tomb of Emperor Guangwu of Han is located. The Yellow River passes under the mountain, eroding the roots of the mountain, and soil blocks often collapse. Ships do not dare to approach. The Yellow River carries sediment, which is another major cause. From Luoyang to Mengjin, according to the locals, the Yellow River has shifted more than twenty li southward in recent years. From there, they returned to Gong County to inspect the Yi River. The advantages and disadvantages of this water are the same as those of the Luo River. At this point, I returned to Jinan, while Wang Committee member continued westward, planning to enter Gansu via Shaanxi, to see the Wushu Mountains, and to reach Qinghai to explore the source of the Yellow River. Then, he planned to go to Hetao and then return to Shandong to visit Chiang Kai-shek in Hankou. Because Chiang had said that as long as there was a way to manage the Yellow River, funding would not be a problem, Wang Yingyu planned to report on the inspection of the entire river and offer suggestions for governing the Yellow River. According to our opinion, governing the Yellow River is by no means as difficult as imagined. Wang Yingyu's opinion, in summary, can be divided into three points: (1) Dredge the end of the Yellow River into the sea to facilitate discharge. (2) The riverbed within Henan Province is too wide, up to forty or fifty li in some places, making it almost impossible to find its true channel. Therefore, the six major changes of the Yellow River have all occurred above Shandong, below Zhengzhou. Efforts should be made to narrow it slightly. (3) Dig the Wushu Mountains to prevent the Tao River from flowing into the Yellow River and instead flow into the Wei River, and then into the Yellow River through the Wei River. This approach can reduce the water volume in Hetao. Once the water is reduced, the sediment carried will also be reduced. After the Tao River enters the Wei River, the increase in clear water will flow into the Yellow River, which can flush away sediment. As far as we know, there are three sources of sediment in the Yellow River: Ningxia, Hetao, and the North Mountain. If we can reduce the water volume in Hetao and build stone dams throughout the river (because after consulting locals along the river in Shandong and Henan, it was said that there were no breaches in places with stone dams), we believe that the Yellow River flood could be permanently eliminated. Although building stone dams is more expensive, it can be done once and for all. Wang Yingyu also suggested that water should be diverted from many places to reduce Yellow River flooding. We originally planned to set up reservoirs along the river to regulate the Yellow River's water flow, but we did not see any suitable locations from Shandong to Henan. I asked Wang to look for a reservoir location further upstream. The above is just a small opinion after our inspection of the Yellow River, not a plan. In the future, it will still need to be carefully studied by national water conservancy experts. (November 3rd)</p>

<p>Xia Family in Xinqiao Robbed: At approximately 1:00 AM on the 1st, three bandits suddenly broke into the home of Xia Xiaodi in the 16th Jia of the 10th Sub-station of Xinqiao. The victim was awakened from his sleep and saw three uninvited guests wearing short, multi-colored clothes, speaking in Hakka dialect, and holding wooden clubs. They violently tied up the victim and forced him to reveal where he had hidden his silver. The victim suffered a shoulder injury. The bandits then rummaged through chests and cabinets, looting money and clothing. Neighbor Xia Wenxiang shouted, causing the bandits to flee with their loot. Xia Wenxiang chased after them but was attacked by the bandits and suffered facial injuries. He pursued them to Inada, where he managed to apprehend one of the bandits, who identified himself as Zheng Zisheng from Zhenjiang. He was immediately sent to the 10th Sub-station and then transferred to the main station for investigation.</p>

<p>Shanghai Anti-Traitor Group Warns Traitorous Merchants: Department stores, foreign goods stores, and general merchandise stores in the cities and towns of this county are holding autumn sales. The other day, the Tonghexiang Silk and Cloth Store in Penglai Town ordered a large number of enemy goods from Shanghai. The Shanghai Blood Soul Anti-Traitor Group detected this and sent a letter of warning yesterday. The letter stated that the store was making every effort to promote Japanese goods during the sale, and they warned the store to seal up the inferior goods or they would take severe measures. They also asked the store to inform all sale merchants to seal up all Japanese goods.</p>

<p>Telegraph Order to Report on Grain Reserves: Since 1922, Wuxi has not levied grain reserves due to severe financial difficulties. All previous reserves were diverted and used during previous price equalization efforts. By last year, there were only about 20,000 yuan left. This summer, the disaster in the villages was very serious, and this money was used to allocate the worst-hit areas for relief. Now there is nothing left. Public groups have repeatedly wired the provincial government, requesting that they continue to levy grain reserve funds, but this has not been approved. Later, the provincial government stated that this autumn harvest was abundant, and all counties' charity granaries should implement grain reserves. The Department of Civil Affairs formulated five provisional measures for building granaries and accumulating grain, ordering all counties to strictly comply. The county government reported the past grain reserve experience of Wuxi to the provincial government. Yesterday, the provincial government sent a telegraph order that it was now the time for the autumn harvest, and they should urgently raise funds to handle grain reserves to maintain the people's food supply. They asked how Wuxi had progressed and ordered them to provide a detailed report as soon as possible for assessment.</p>
<p>The Reaction to Refining Sandalwood Oil: Near the Tiantang Catholic Church in Beitang Sanliqiao, Zhang Zhongnan of Hengchang Ironworks recently set up a sandalwood oil kerosene factory, refining kerosene by machine every day. Peng Xiwen, director of the 5th Public Security Bureau, because the factory was located in a busy city and was likely to cause danger, reported to the main bureau for instructions and ordered it to be banned. However, the factory ignored the law and continued refining as usual. The neighbors nearby have risen up in opposition and jointly submitted a letter to the county government and public security bureau yesterday, requesting that police be sent to stop it to protect life and property, and asking that the person in charge of the factory be summoned for investigation.</p>

<p>Villagers Destroy District Office: The 19th District Office of Wuyi is located in the Dongyue Temple in Wansui Town. Recently, some villagers initiated a celebration for welcoming the gods. Xie Yingzheng, the district chief, because the rural economy was declining and the local area was uneasy, gathered the heads of the celebration to persuade them to stop it. On the 27th and 28th of last month, reactionary notices suddenly appeared in the town, declaring that the district office must be overthrown. Xie District Chief, seeing the situation was not good, requested the county government to send police to the town to maintain order. On the evening of the 2nd of this month, at about 5:00 PM, most of the villagers suddenly rang gongs and gathered a crowd, bringing flammable materials with them, breaking down the gate of the district office and rushing in. They threw bricks and stones and destroyed the office, burning all equipment and documents. At that time, the police team was unable to stop them due to being outnumbered. In a crisis, Xie District Chief jumped out of the building with the official seal and escaped with his life. Some staff members are missing. After escaping, Xie District Chief came to the city overnight to report to the county government and requested assistance from various agencies. The county government ordered You Zhenji, the public security chief of the town, to investigate and arrest the instigators.</p>

<p>Joint Salary Demand Meeting of Two District Schools: The education funding in this county has been in arrears for many years, now reaching seven or eight months. Those responsible for education have not been able to come up with a good solution, causing unease among those serving in education. The last year's arrears totaled more than six months. Although school has been in session for a long time this year, the bureau has only paid for two and a half months as a formality. The schools are unable to maintain themselves, and the situation in the countryside is even worse. Now that the 21st area's taxes have begun to be levied, the education funding being collected totals more than 400,000 yuan, but the authorities are still not releasing it. The schools are therefore extremely panicked. The other day, the 4th school district held a salary demand meeting for the teachers and staff of each school in Bixi City. They unanimously decided to petition the education bureau to be responsible for repaying half of the old debt in the shortest possible time, and the new funds must not be delayed again. The schools in the 3rd school district are also taking similar action and are said to be joining together to petition the city this week.</p>

<p>A Tragically Disabled Monk by Gambling Thugs: Dai Li, the principal of a certain elementary school in the city, left his wife and children impoverished after his death. His wife was blind, so she sold her son to the North Temple to become a monk in order to pay for the funeral. She herself worked as a peddler, which she had been doing for years. The other day, gamblers were gathering to gamble in the North Temple when they were discovered by the Public Security Bureau, who arrested the gambler Zhang and punished him. Zhang suspected that Dai's son had reported him. After being released, he and several other gamblers lured Dai's son to their house. Zhang and his wife tied up Dai's son and beat him repeatedly. They then used two yellow croaker tail needles to nail into his knees. This needle is the most poisonous, causing the flesh to rot without healing. Many local ruffians hoard them for revenge. Immediately, Dai's son shouted for help, but Zhang's wife sprinkled quicklime into his eyes, immediately blinding and muting him, and he fainted to the ground. The next day, someone discovered him, covered in blood and barely alive, so they sent him to the hospital. Today, a needle has been removed. The doctor said that both legs must be amputated to save his life. The perpetrators have all fled.</p>

This has been reported in the newspaper. It has now been discovered that a certain Huang, a party member of the 4th District, has evidence of conspiracy with bandits. He had sneaked in from Shanghai and was watching a play at the Xinmin Theater.

<p>Lin Min Acquitted in the Xu Zhuoran Murder Case: The case of Xu Zhuoran, a prominent Fujian Min party figure, being stabbed to death in Xiamen was transferred to the Hangzhou County Local Court in 1930. After repeated trials, in June 1931, the court acquitted the three suspects of conspiracy to murder, Ye Cai-Zhen, Chen Yan-Xiang, and Chen De-Lin. However, Lin Luo was sentenced to four years in prison for possessing military weapons. The prosecutor appealed to the High Court, and the case was under appeal. Later, the troops stationed in Fujian Province captured Lin Min, the main suspect in this case, and the suspects Chen Chang, and the witnesses Zhang Jichang and Liu Zhi, and sent them to Hangzhou for investigation. It was deemed that there was insufficient evidence, and Chen Chang, Zhang Jichang, and Liu Zhi were declared not prosecuted. As for the suspect Lin Min, the Hangzhou County Local Court opened a trial on October 28th. Lin not only denied killing Xu, but also denied that he was Yao Min, claiming that his real name was Zhang Meng. After debate by the lawyers on both sides, the judge declared the debate in this case concluded. Yesterday (the 4th) afternoon at 2:00 PM, the verdict was announced. Judge Zhu Bao-Ren summoned Lin Min, asked about his age and origin. Lin still claimed that his real name was Zhang Meng, not Lin Min. The judge declared: (1) Lin Min is definitely Lin Min, not Zhang Meng. (2) There is insufficient evidence to prove that Lin Min committed the murder, so he is declared not guilty. The ancillary civil lawsuit filed by Xu's wife, Ye, was rejected.</p>

The scourge of opium is known to all. I have been in the business community for more than twenty years, and I have recently been entrusted with the position of sixth district commander of the county's defense corps. I ask myself daily about local public affairs. I have never heard of the public sale of opium in this county. As for the claim that I have contracted it, it is even further from the truth. I believe it is a mistake due to inaccurate reporting by the interviewer. This matter concerns my reputation, and I am writing this letter specifically to correct the record. I request that it be published in the correspondence column to rectify the mishearing and clarify the facts. I respectfully send this to the esteemed chief editor of the Shen Bao. Respectfully, Zhu Jingzhi, November 3rd.</p>

<h3 id="e113">The Issue of the Minister of Education After Weng Wenhao's Resignation <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Zhu Jiahua Urges Weng to Come to Beijing by Telegram</p>
<p>There is Talk of Duan Xipeng Temporarily Acting as Minister</p>
<p>Zhu Jiahua Urges Weng by Telegram: Zhu Jiahua, the Minister of Transportation, arrived on the 3rd to take office. However, Weng Wenhao, the Minister of Education, has repeatedly expressed his refusal to take the position. Former Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua, knowing that he must go to the Ministry of Transportation to oversee matters and that the Ministry of Education's responsibilities are important and cannot be left without leadership, sent a telegram to the new Minister of Education, Weng Wenhao, in Beijing on the 3rd, urging him to come to Beijing immediately to take office. The telegram stated roughly: "I have been repeatedly urged to go to the Ministry of Transportation and have decided to go to Jiang on the (3rd) to take office. The affairs of the Ministry of Education are important and cannot be left without leadership. Please come to Beijing quickly to take office." After Zhu went to the Ministry of Transportation, he temporarily entrusted the affairs of the Ministry of Education to the two vice ministers to handle until the new minister arrives, at which point he will formally hand over the duties.</p>
<p>Weng's Resignation Issue: Since the Central Government appointed Weng as the Minister of Education, Weng, who was in Beijing at the time, immediately stated that he had not been consulted beforehand and was unwilling to take the position. When Weng went to Beijing, he also told reporters that he was firmly resigning from the Ministry of Education. The Executive Yuan has sent a telegram of consolation, urging him to come to Beijing to take office quickly. As of the 3rd, they had not yet received Weng's reply. Therefore, although there has been much speculation in society about the successor to Weng after his resignation, these are all just groundless rumors. The government has not yet formally discussed the matter. Talk of Duan Xipeng Acting as Minister: Since the Central Government announced Weng as the Minister of Education, the Vice Minister of Education, Duan Xipeng, immediately claimed illness and resigned. However, after being consoled by the Executive Yuan, he resumed his duties at the Ministry of Education on the 2nd. As a result, there is a strong rumor that the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee is approaching. If Weng Wenhao is truly determined to resign, Duan will temporarily act as Minister, and a formal appointment will be made after the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee. This rumor seems plausible, and we will record it here for verification.</p>

<p>The Jiang-Zhe foil and business tax has an annual revenue of 2.7 million yuan, with a monthly revenue of over 200,000 yuan. After consultation between the Jiang-Zhe provinces, in addition to supplementing the Ministry of Education's expenses with 10,000 yuan per month, 22,500 yuan will be allocated to the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education and Finance. The remaining revenue will belong to Zhejiang Province. Due to financial difficulties, various provinces are significantly in arrears on payments to the Ministry. A few days ago, Zhou Junyan, Director of the Zhejiang Department of Finance, returned to Hangzhou from Hankou. When he passed through Nanjing, Minister Zhu Jiahua had personally discussed and approved the immediate remittance of 40,000 yuan. Now that Zhu has been ordered to transfer to the Ministry of Transportation and has already handed over his duties, he specifically sent a telegram to Zhou yesterday, saying that he had promised to plan to supplement the Ministry's education funds with 40,000 yuan. Although the Ministry of Education will soon be handing over its duties and cannot clear the education expenses, the items for the education funds must be further divided. Please allocate 20,000 yuan to be remitted to Beijing within the next few days to meet urgent needs.</p>

Dr. Lin Falde, Bai Tuo Lai, Chen Heqin, Shi Shou Deng, Bai Er, Dr. Weiss Locke, Dr. Man Yin, and Ms. Yang were elected as members of the committee. After the election, Dr. Craigh, Doctor of Science from the University of London, gave a lecture on (the benefits of educational groups). He briefly stated that the establishment of the society can enable the education community in Shanghai to connect with each other, exchange knowledge, and maintain the power of the National Teachers' Association of the United Kingdom, as well as the history of industrial education in the United Kingdom. The technical schools in the United Kingdom were produced by mechanical vocational schools after several reforms. Government subsidies were initially based on passing certain examinations and the number of students. Teachers' salaries were also determined by the results of the examinations. After the government introduced the wine tax for the army and navy, it also allocated funds for education. The doctor detailed the entire method by which the local government education committee and the higher education committee handle education. Finally, he briefly spoke about the recent situation of various industrial schools in London. After the lecture, the doctor also answered questions from the guests regarding the process of teaching woodworking at Zhongshan Elementary School and the method of guiding textile technology in certain schools in the industrial area. Finally, Mr. Kangpu thanked Dr. Craigh on behalf of the guests. Mr. Shi Shou Deng of Gezhi Public School is the treasurer of the society and keeps the list of members.

<p>▲ More Than 30 Schools Respond</p>
<p>▲ Meeting This Afternoon at 1:00 PM to Discuss Methods</p>
<p>The French Concession in this city has a large area and a large population. However, there are only more than 40 primary and secondary schools in the concession. Among them, the only municipal school is the Bide No. 1 Elementary School, and the rest are private. Due to limited funding, they have not been able to expand as much as possible, causing many school-age children in the concession to suffer from a lack of opportunities to attend school. The neighboring Public Concession, since the Shanghai Municipal Council allocated subsidies, has received as much as 10,000 taels per year for many schools, and at least 1,000 taels per year. The development prospects of each school are limitless. If the French Municipal Council does not have a similar plan, and the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education is unable to establish more schools in the French Concession, then future private schools will inevitably seek school sites in the Public Concession, and the development of education in the French Concession will have even less hope. Ma Jiazhen, the Principal of Huadong Middle School, has recognized this and specifically advocated the proposal to request subsidies from the French Municipal Council. The local educational administrative authorities and the city party headquarters and the city education association have expressed great sympathy and will give it strong support. As for the private schools, more than 30 schools have responded, and it has been decided that a meeting will be held at 1:00 PM this afternoon at the Girls' Department of Huadong Middle School on Beile Road, Xujiahui Road to discuss methods.</p>

<p>(Central News Agency) The private Minben Elementary School in Yu Kang Li, Chujia Bridge, French Concession, is the former private Huigong No. 3 Elementary School that was banned by the Jin Education Bureau. The content of the school was corrupt, and it falsely claimed to be registered with the Municipal Bureau of Education.

<p>The Municipal Bureau of Education has established 48 civil supplementary schools in various districts this year, with a total of 54 classes, as reported in previous newspapers. The average number of students in each central civil supplementary school is over 100. The number of students in each mobile civil school and attached civil supplementary school is stipulated to be 40 per class, but most exceed the stipulation, and some particularly developed ones have reached over 80. In total, there are over 1,600 students in all civil schools and over 600 students in supplementary schools. The schools have now been open for more than a month. The Bureau of Education has stipulated that in addition to the inspectors from the Supervision Department distributing inspections, the principals of the central civil supplementary schools will conduct inspections by district, and the chiefs of the responsible departments and the directors of the civil supplementary education section will conduct inspections in turn to promote progress. Once the revised inspection form is printed, they will set off.</p>

As for the Czech and Qinglian teams, their strength is not weak either. It can be predicted that there will be an excellent performance. The order in the stadium was originally to be handled by the Guangqi Scouts. However, because the army had to go to the town for inspection, the YMCA Scouts have been hired to take care of the stadium.

Liang Deguang and Ma Candan of the quarterfinals are also emerging tennis talents. Their draws and kills can be called first-class, and their minds are not disturbed. They are always consistent. Their victory yesterday was not accidental. The two won one and sent one, which was very effective. There was no way for the opponent to enter. The game records of yesterday are recorded as follows:</p>

<p>Tonight's Women's and B Group Finals</p>
<p>B Group Finals Start at 6:00 PM</p>
<p>Women's Finals at 7:00 PM</p>
<p>The Chizhi and Tongji basketball teams competed for the A Group championship in the disaster relief basketball tournament last night at the Chinese Basketball Hall. As a result, Chizhi relied on their magical shooting and solid lineup to defeat Tongji 40-27 and win the championship. The two teams performed well, and the 300 to 400 spectators were all satisfied. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Tongji Takes the Lead First</p>
<p>The Tongji University team's rewards are not weak. In the preliminary round, they defeated John. Their ball skills were praised by the audience. When they competed with Chizhi, they took the lead first. The momentum was great, and they took the lead with 11 to 4. The audience was worried about Chizhi.</p>
<p>Chizhi Temporarily Gives In</p>
<p>At this point, Chizhi worked hard to dominate and strive to take the lead. Qian Dingshen and Yang Linyu tried wonderful shots many times. The score gradually got closer. Over time, they once surpassed the top with 14 to 13, one point ahead of Tongji. But with time running out, Tongji regained the upper hand and won the first half with 16 to 14. Chizhi temporarily gave in.</p>
<p>The Fierce Battle in the Second Half</p>
<p>Starting in the second half, Chizhi Qi’s forwards stood out and used wonderful tactics to form a team from front to back, and they got wonderful shots from Yang, Guo, and Qian. The points increased sharply. Although Tongji was unwilling to show weakness and worked hard to attack the door, they were helpless because the opponent was well-prepared and impenetrable. Perseverance and re-efforts were ultimately ineffective. As a result, Chizhi won with 40 to 27 and won the championship. Although Tongji lost, their performance was also exhausted, and it was not a crime of war.</p>

<h3 id="e142">The People's Food Association Plans to Establish Rural Public Warehouses <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>The Treasure Implementation Method Has Been Approved at the First Meeting</p>
<p>The Third Meeting Is Scheduled to Be Held in Suzhou on the 19th</p>
<p>This year's timing is appropriate, and the rice harvest is abundant. However, society is affected by the war, various industries are in decline, and the economy is depleted, leading to a disparity in the supply and demand of grain and a tragic drop in market prices. The impact on the livelihoods of farmers and the national economy is extremely significant. The Shanghai Local Association, therefore, invited the chambers of commerce of Nanjing and major rice-producing areas in Jiangsu Province to meet twice in Wuxi and Zhenjiang. Starting on the 28th of last month, the Jiangsu-Shanghai People's Food Regulation Association was established. The association held its second meeting in Shanghai the day before yesterday, and the implementation methods for establishing rural public warehouses were discussed. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Second Meeting: Jiangsu-Shanghai People's Food Regulation</p>
<p>The Association held its second committee meeting at the Shanghai Local Association at 7 PM on the 3rd of this month. The attendees included representatives from the Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Zhenjiang, Wuxi, and Wuxian Chambers of Commerce, including Hu Jianchun and Wang Xiaolai, and representatives from the Shanghai Local Association, including Shi Liangcai and Huang Renzhi, and others, more than ten people in total. He Yushu, Director of the Jiangsu Industrial Department, also personally attended the meeting in Shanghai. The meeting was chaired by Qian Sunqing, a representative from the Wuxi Chamber of Commerce. First, Yu Xiaochuan, a representative from the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce, Qian Sunqing, a representative from the Wuxi Chamber of Commerce, and Huang Renzhi, a representative from the Shanghai Local Association, reported on the progress of various matters and the situation of contact with various parties. Then, the draft implementation plan for establishing rural public warehouses in various places was discussed. After revising the wording, it was unanimously approved. Regarding the methods for contacting the financial sector, it was decided that the representatives attending the meeting should participate in the Shanghai Local Association's banking industry meeting tomorrow (i.e., yesterday) to discuss everything. It was also decided to recommend a representative to meet with Minister Song to petition. The petition was drafted by Huang Renzhi. Furthermore, it was resolved that the next meeting would be held in Suzhou on the 19th of this month.</p>
<p>Implementation Methods: The following are the implementation methods for establishing rural public warehouses in various places, officially issued by the Jiangsu-Shanghai People's Food Regulation Association: The market price of new grain has plummeted, and the farmers' hard work throughout the year cannot be sold promptly, and even if it is sold, it is not enough to repay debts and meet all living needs. This has a minor impact on the future livelihoods of farmers and a major impact on undermining the national economic foundation. According to reports from various parties, the situation is extremely urgent. The colleagues gathered twice in Wuxi and Zhenjiang to organize this association, seeking the circulation of grain and wheat in various provinces, the reduction and exemption of donations and taxes, the implementation of taxes on imported foreign rice, and the revitalization of the commercial and economic circulation. In particular, the establishment of rural public warehouses in rice-producing areas to receive rice and grain mortgages from farmers is considered the most effective direct relief method. Therefore, the implementation procedures have been carefully discussed, and the following methods are proposed for the reference and implementation of gentlemen who are enthusiastic about relief in rice-producing areas. Article 1: In all rice-producing areas, the original public organizations or specially formed groups should handle the establishment of rural public warehouses. Article 2: The above-mentioned organizations should simultaneously plan on-site and recommend local figures with outstanding reputations who are trusted by the financial community to be responsible for contacting local or nearby metropolitan financial institutions. Article 3: Local farmers' banks should take responsibility and be the initiators of this matter. Those who have not handled mortgages should promptly prepare to handle them. Those who have already handled them should find ways to expand them. If their strength is insufficient, they can join the local persons publicly recommended in the previous article to be responsible for contact and jointly proceed. Article 4: These public warehouses should be located in the center of the countryside to facilitate the nearby farmers to send mortgages of agricultural products. The location should be decentralized and should not be concentrated in one place. Article 5: These public warehouses are intended to benefit poor farmers, so the number of agricultural households sending mortgages of agricultural products may be limited per household to ensure that a wider range of people benefit. Article 6: The houses required for these warehouses may be borrowed from public temples or other buildings, or rented from private houses. In general, the site should be high and dry and convenient for transportation. Article 7: These warehouses shall receive agricultural products subject to mortgages at 70% to 80% of the market price to ensure fairness. Article 8: These warehouses shall receive agricultural products subject to mortgages, and according to the current situation, the interest rate shall be one percent per month. The warehouse rent, insurance, and all other expenses shall be calculated separately and shall be kept to a minimum. Article 9: If there are two or more financial institutions in a place that handle these warehouses, it is advisable to organize a joint office to handle them jointly. Article 10: If various places are preparing these warehouses and have determined the organization and recommended responsible personnel, and want to request a loan from a financial institution in a certain place, the organizations of this association in that place should jointly contact and assist in the process.</p>
<p>Wang Zhixin Talks: At noon yesterday, the association also held a meeting at the Shanghai Local Association to discuss methods for contacting the Shanghai financial community. After the meeting, according to Tu Zhixin, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Farmers' Bank, speaking to the Central News Agency reporter, today's (i.e., yesterday's) afternoon meeting did not result in any concrete decisions. The difficulty lies in the issue of security guarantees for financial investors after the investment. This relief project is inherently the business that the Jiangsu Provincial Farmers' Bank should handle. However, because this relief must cover the entire province, the scope is large and the funds required are large. The Farmers' Bank is forced to ask various financial institutions to provide assistance. In places where farmers' branch offices have already been established and where storage warehouses have been set up, it is easy to implement. Those who have local wealthy merchants who can be trusted can also be asked to act as agents. Since the financial industry is not solely for the purpose of making profits, the Farmers' Bank is also willing to guarantee all parties, but these branch offices and warehouses are concentrated in the Jiangnan area and have not been able to cover the entire territory, and the total capacity of all the warehouses is only 100,000 to 120,000 dan. Therefore, although the various financial institutions are generally providing assistance now, how will the Farmers' Bank accept it to ensure that all farmers in the province enjoy its benefits and provide investors with the most reliable guarantees? This is the so-called difficulty. After several contacts, a part of the banks has added their consent, but I hope that the above-mentioned difficulties can be resolved as soon as possible, and that the various financial institutions can also cooperate and assist, so that the farmers will benefit a lot. The next meeting is scheduled to be held in Suzhou, but I am afraid I will not be able to attend. It has been decided to proceed first in places where farmers' banks and warehouses have already been established, he said.</p>
<h3 id="e143">The French Concession Taxpayer Chinese Association Advocates Rent Reduction and Land Price Stabilization <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Letter to the French Consul General</p>
<p>The French Concession Taxpayer Chinese Association sent a letter to the French Consul General, stating: "Respectfully, this is based on a letter from the French Concession Commercial Federation, stating that the various businesses on this road and the residents of Chengzhi Lane, Bulin Lane, Ji'an Lane, Yuqing Lane, Gaodi Lane, Hezhong Lane, and Taiyuan Fang have stated that the market is sluggish, rents are expensive, and it is difficult to bear. We request to promote rent reduction in order to maintain the market. Based on this, since the Shanghai 1.28 Incident, the market depression in the two concessions has been roughly the same. However, the Public Concession, bordering North Shanghai, has suffered more direct losses than the French Concession. However, before long, it was able to restore its former appearance, and considering the recent desolate scene of the French Concession, it has become increasingly obvious. In the past year, although the houses in the remote areas, once renovated, were rented out early before the completion of the work. Now, the city houses in the central area of Zhengjia Wood Bridge Street Hongyu Fang, etc., have been completed for a long time, and only a few have been rented out. These current situations are still obvious. As for the commercial situation, it is even more difficult. Although the appearance of the various businesses has to be exaggerated, most of them are strong on the outside but weak on the inside,勉爲支持, If this continues, it is inevitable that the situation will plummet, and in the near future, the French Concession, which has been gradually prospering for decades, will gradually degenerate and cannot be remedied. Therefore, we are especially reporting the situation and requesting your association to truthfully submit it to the French Consul General for review and give relief in order to maintain the market and conform to public opinion. Based on this, the various sections stated by the association are indeed facts. Our association believes that at present, in order to correct deviations and make up for shortcomings, it is not enough to reduce rents in order to maintain the market and stabilize people's hearts. However, if you want to reduce rents, it is useless if you do not first stabilize the land price. Because if the land price is first stabilized, the house price will also be stable. There is a close relationship between them. However, the current French Municipal Council has raised the land price in order to increase tax revenue, which is contrary to the market situation and is not appropriate. Your Consul General is coming to comfort us, and he will be able to understand the situation. You should make a decisive decision and quickly reduce the arbitrarily raised land price estimated by the current French Municipal Council, and allow our association to elect two Chinese members to participate in the Land Price Committee. We will be grateful. This is to the French Consul General, Merley, the French Concession Taxpayer Chinese Association.</p>

<h3 id="e146">After the Swiss Consul General in Shanghai is Promoted to Chargé d'Affaires, Sino-Swiss Relations Should Be Further Enhanced <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>The Chargé d'Affaires Office Will Be Located in Shanghai</p>
<p>Central News Agency reported: "Yesterday, Chinese and Western newspapers published news that the Swiss Federal Administrative Committee will promote the Swiss Consul General in Shanghai to Chargé d'Affaires in China. Yesterday morning, the Central News Agency reporter specifically visited Lao Di, the Swiss Consul General in Shanghai, at his consulate to inquire whether the office had received formal orders. As Lao Di was out on official business, the reporter was received by Tan Li Ke, the acting consul. The interview is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Haven't Received Clear Orders Yet: According to Tan, he and others only saw in the newspapers the news that Lao Di, the Consul General in Shanghai, was promoted to Chargé d'Affaires in China. However, Sino-Swiss relations are becoming increasingly close, and the news is probably not a rumor. Therefore, the consulate firmly believes that a clear order will arrive in Shanghai soon. As for whether Lao Di will still serve concurrently as Consul General in Shanghai after the Consul General is promoted to Chargé d'Affaires, it is not yet known. However, it is dared to believe that the Chargé d'Affaires office will be located in Shanghai. As for the organization of the Chargé d'Affaires office, it will also wait until a clear order is received before requesting instructions.</p>
<p>Recent Situation of Swiss Nationals in China: Tan also said that according to the latest survey, there are a total of 480 Swiss nationals in China, of which 225 are in Shanghai. Swiss nationals who come to China are initially engaged in the silk industry, because the Swiss nationals who come to China are all from the city of Schaffhausen, Switzerland. The city is an industrial area, and the silk industry is one of Switzerland's famous products. However, after the Swiss nationals arrive in China, some have changed industries one after another. As for Chinese people traveling to Switzerland, the number is very large, mostly students. The Swiss government is quite preferential to Chinese citizens entering the country, and passport fees are not charged. Now that the Consul General in Shanghai has been promoted to Chargé d'Affaires, Sino-Swiss relations should be further enhanced in the future.</p>
<p>Proportion of Sino-Swiss Trade: Swiss goods exported to China in Sino-Swiss trade mainly include machinery, watches, silk, pigments, condensed milk sugar, etc. Chinese goods exported to Switzerland include raw silk, straw hat braids, tea monosodium glutamate, soy sauce, sausages, etc. According to a survey in 1930, Chinese exports to Switzerland totaled more than 10 million Swiss francs, and Swiss goods exported to China totaled 29 million Swiss francs. According to a survey in 1931, Chinese goods exported to Switzerland totaled more than 10 million Swiss francs, and Swiss goods exported to China totaled more than 19 million Swiss francs. The exact trade figures for this year are higher than last year. Tan continued to say that the Sino-Swiss trade treaty was signed in Tokyo as early as June 12, 1918.</p>

<p>Collecting Excellent Products from All Over the Country</p>
<p>Forming a National Products Trade Center</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Products Company, located opposite the Hongmiao Temple on Nanjing Road, opens today. It is reported that the company's organization</p>
<p>at the beginning, was initiated by Wu Zhihao, Wang Xiaolai, Chen Depei, Fu Fangting, Lu Qisheng, and others, and the shares have been fully collected. The board of directors elected Wu Zhihao as chairman and general manager, Zhu Bingzhang as manager, and Lu Qisheng as vice light manager. Looking around the market, the scale is grand, the collection is rich, and there are more than 10,000 kinds of internal displays. More than 1,400 manufacturers are selling, with colorful and perfect products. Visiting the stores, there are silk, leather goods, woolen fabrics, Suzhou embroidery, lace, jewelry, clothing, and cosmetics departments, with novel patterns.

Observing the prices set for various goods, they are very low, and visitors from all walks of life are welcome. Shanghai National Products Co., Ltd.</p>
<p>Opening Declaration: Time has come to this day, the economic competition is increasingly fierce. It is appropriate that our country is a weak country with underdeveloped industries and a backward economy, forming a semi-colonial land. Now, the whole country, from the top to the bottom, is panic-stricken and engaged in promoting national products and saving the country through industry in order to revive the economy. However, after years of practice, little success has been achieved. The reason for this is certainly not one-sided. However, merely having concrete Shanghai National Products Company building drawings</p>
<p>advocacy without actual measures, and merely having individual production and sales without overall statistics, are the key to the conclusion. China has a vast territory and a large population. Raw materials and commodities vary from place to place. Or, what is produced in this place is what is needed in that country, or that country has an oversupply while this place has an over-demand. If we can adjust it accordingly, then production and sales will be commensurate, and supply and demand will correspond. Industry will naturally be easy to develop. Now, transportation in various places is inconvenient, and national products trading has no suitable location, so that producers wait to sell but cannot, and consumers want to buy but cannot. Therefore, how can we expect the development of industry and improve foreign trade? If we reverse this and guide it according to the situation and promote it according to the time, then our country's raw materials are superior to the world, enough to supply emerging industries with a surplus, and the customs are simple and honest, the labor is diligent and the salary is low, and the cost of commodities must be lower than that of Europe and the United States. It is easy to promote and sell well. Even in terms of existing industries, many are exquisite and unparalleled, with ingenious craftsmanship, such as the silks and satins of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, which are brilliant and pleasing to the eye, the porcelain of Jiangxi, which is smooth and clear, the embroidery of Suzhou and Hunan, which is realistic and vivid, the bamboo ware of Fenghua, which is ingenious and natural, and the carvings of Ningbo, which are lifelike. In addition, there are lacquerware in Fujian and summer cloth in Hubei, which are too many to enumerate. In terms of products, the leather goods of Beijing and Shaanxi are light, warm, and comfortable, especially in the mouth. In short, each province in our country has special products due to different climates and customs. If we can collect and promote them, it will also add luster to national products. The same</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>People and others, in view of this, dare not overestimate themselves and organize Shanghai National Products Co., Ltd. in Shanghai, the economic center of the country, with the aim of collecting local products and industrial products from various provinces to form a national products trade center to meet the needs of supply and demand. Therefore, in addition to setting up retail stores, we also set up management, wholesale, promotion, consignment sales, and foreign trade departments to promote actively with a fearless spirit, so that our national products are complete in every beauty and reach far and wide, seeking to achieve the goal of saving the country through industry. It is also what patriotic compatriots are happy to hear. However, at the beginning of the establishment, there are many aspects to manage and rely on the support of all sectors of society to make up for our shortcomings, so that our company's business is booming and sets the precedent for the national products central trade, then the rise of those who hear the news in various places will move forward without limits, and the future of national products will become more and more bright and splendid. Compared with today's humble company, it will be laughed at as a drop in the ocean. It is for the self-encouragement of the Chinese people. This is the declaration, only hoping for public review.</p>

According to the talk, several years ago, there was news of a joint venture shipping company between China and Belgium, but there has been no news of it now. A Belgian citizen came to China some time ago to carry out the establishment of shipping, but I have not heard of any discussions with the Chinese side about a joint venture, he said.</p>

Generally speaking, a large part will be underwritten in Shanghai, and the rest will be handed over to the provinces and cities. The issuance period of the treasury bills is also next month. At present, the Ministry of Finance is planning the repayment method, he said.</p>

<p>Talks with Two Petition Representatives from Vietnam</p>
<p>Huang An and Xu Yixian Change Their Trip to Beijing to Tomorrow Evening</p>
<p>The Chinese General Chamber of Commerce of Southern Vietnam dispatched representatives to return to China to petition regarding the Sino-French treaty issue. They were originally scheduled to enter Beijing tonight, but the trip has been changed to tomorrow evening. A reporter from the Guowen News Agency interviewed the two representatives, Huang An and Xu Yixian, at their hotel yesterday. According to them, "We have been in Shanghai for a week since returning to China, and we are deeply grateful for the strong support from various organizations in Shanghai. We are also particularly thankful for the extensive advocacy by the media. The outcome of this trip to Beijing is not yet known in the short term, but it is to fulfill our mission. As for the government, it should urgently seek the liberation of hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese to save them from the crisis because the overseas Chinese compatriots' love for their motherland is no less than that of compatriots at home."</p>
<p>The National Goods Factories Association telegraphed the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Industry yesterday because the Southern Vietnam Chamber of Commerce representatives have returned to China and requested the implementation of the commercial treaty. The telegram stated, "Since the new Sino-Vietnamese commercial treaty was not implemented, Chinese compatriots are in a position as a country without a treaty, bearing heavy taxes. If this continues, the cost difference will become increasingly disparate, and foreign trade will fall into a desperate situation, which will greatly affect the national economy and people's livelihood. The Southern Vietnam Chamber of Commerce dispatched representatives to return to China to petition. We urge your ministry to consider the promotion of domestic products, which is of great importance, and grant them an audience. Then, negotiate with France as soon as possible to urge them to implement the new commercial treaty to maintain diplomatic relations and value credibility."</p>

<p>Japanese Residents Demand the Inclusion of Japanese Police Officers</p>
<p>According to the "Da Mei Evening News," negotiations between the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Public Concession authorities regarding road construction beyond the border have been temporarily suspended due to the opposition of Japanese residents in recent weeks. Months of negotiations between the two parties seemed to be nearing a resolution of this long-standing dispute, but they were thwarted again by the obstinate attitude of the Japanese. The biggest difficulty lies in the issue of special police for road construction beyond the border. It seemed that this matter could be satisfactorily resolved between the Municipal Government and the Concession authorities, but it is now difficult to expect progress in the negotiations due to the sudden demand by Japanese residents to include Japanese police officers. Since the end of the Shanghai War, official opinion has generally held that Japanese residents would comply with the solution to the road construction beyond the border issue. Even Japanese officials in this city have made various expressions.</p>

After the government vigorously issued treasury bonds and exempted export taxes, the factories tried to resume operations to maintain the livelihoods of the workers. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency met with Shen Huachen, chairman of the Silk Manufacturers Association, yesterday. According to him, as of yesterday, a total of 65 silk factories in the city have started operations, an increase of more than 20 factories compared to the previous month. Although the European and American silk markets have improved compared to last year, they have declined compared to last month. The B-grade is about US$1.40 per pound, equivalent to 470 to 480 taels of Huayin silver, and there is still no improvement. The factories are waiting for an opportunity to sell their silk to avoid excessive losses.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Songhu Relief Committee Agrees to Allocate Funds</p>
<p>The Puhuitang Canal has been silted up for a long time, and the drinking water is foul and smelly, so it needs to be dredged urgently. Gentlemen from Shanghai, Songjiang, and Qingpu counties, including Ma Xiangbo, Zhang Weicheng, Yang Fuyuan, and Li Yinxian, organized a dredging promotion committee. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, representatives from Shanghai, Songjiang, and Qingpu, including Yang Fuyuan, Zhang Weicheng, Li Youyan, and Gu Jinjie, met with Hu Junzhuang, a standing member of the National Government's Shanghai Songhu War Zone Rehabilitation Committee, to request relief. Commissioner Hu said that the Puhuitang Canal spans more than thirty li and is an important canal in Shanghai and Jiangsu, so it needs to be dredged urgently. He agreed to allocate funds to assist and will ask the Executive Yuan to pass it. He also said that the gentlemen are enthusiastic local gentry, so they should quickly formulate a detailed plan before determining the method of allocating funds. At 1:00 PM, gentlemen from Shanghai, Songjiang, and Qingpu counties held an emergency meeting. Zhang Weicheng, Li Youyan, and others reported on the negotiations. It was decided to convene a meeting of the Shanghai Songjiang Qingpu Dredging Puhuitang Canal Committee at 3:00 PM on the sixth, and Zhang Weicheng was publicly elected as a representative to meet with the Rehabilitation Committee authorities to request the prompt approval of funds. It is said that Zhang will go to negotiate tomorrow.</p>
<h3 id="e157">The National Goods Exhibition Starts Returning Items Yesterday <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Review Completed and Awards Will Be Issued Soon</p>
<p>Since the closing of the Shanghai National Goods Exhibition, the review for awarding prizes has taken longer due to the large variety of items displayed by the manufacturers. It is reported that the review has been completed, so the association started returning items yesterday. According to the review results, the textile category had the most winners, with more than ten manufacturers winning the top prize, more than twenty winning the excellent prize, and several winning the first prize. Because there were fewer participants in the art category, only several won the top prize and several won the excellent prize. The review of the other categories has also been completed, and the awards are expected to be issued in a few days.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Jiangwan City Committee Reports to the Municipal Government on the Petition of Villagers <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>More than 3,000 women and children in the Jiangwan district petitioned the municipal commissioners of the district yesterday morning to restore civilian residences. The municipal commissioners of the district, together with representatives of various organizations in the district, reported the progress to the municipal government yesterday and asked for instructions. The Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, Yu Hongjun, received them and promised to find a way to provide relief. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Reporting the Progress Those who went to the Municipal Government to report yesterday included Wu Xuen, municipal commissioner of the district, Gu Shanzhang, member of the 7th District Party Department, Lu Yubin, executive of the Education Association, Zhong Yibo, director of the branch office of the Chamber of Commerce, and Wang Wujun, executive of the Farmers' Association. Secretary-General Yu received them. Wu Xuen, a member of the Jiangwan City Committee, reported on the progress. He said that the purpose of the petition was to request the construction of houses on the spot. One reason is that the civilian materials built by the local maintenance committee are not suitable for the lives of farmers. The second reason is that building houses in Dachang Miaohang in neighboring districts is more common, which makes them feel inferior. According to the recent survey, there are 301 households with 2,139 rooms damaged in the town, and 2,362 households with a total of 7,498 rooms damaged in the countryside. Currently, the reliable relief funds are 60,000 yuan from the local maintenance committee. After spending 39,000 yuan to build the First Civilian Memorial Village, there is still 21,000 yuan left, which is prepared for the construction of the Second Civilian Village. Now, the committee has slightly agreed to change the method to distribute it for scattered construction. The War Zone Rehabilitation Committee should allocate 25,000 yuan to Jiangwan for house construction, which has also been decided to be changed to relief. The total is 46,000 yuan. Assuming that each household needs to build one room, 2,362 rooms need to be built. If the cost per room is 100 yuan, it will cost 236,200 yuan, which is still short of 190,000 yuan. If the second poorest is not counted, deducting two-thirds, and removing the 46,000 yuan, there is still a shortage of 120,000 yuan. The Municipal Government should promptly allocate this fund to provide relief and benefit the people's livelihood.</p>
<p>Mr. Yu's Reply Secretary-General Yu replied that the disaster area in Jiangwan is significant, and the countryside is more severe than any other area. The housing problem in winter is extremely important. The Municipal Government has ordered the Municipal Social Bureau to allocate all of the existing relief fund of 25,000 yuan to Jiangwan to work with the municipal commissioners to properly plan relief methods. On the one hand, there are 21,000 yuan from the local maintenance committee, totaling 46,000 yuan, which is the first relief fund issued a month ago. On the other hand, the Rehabilitation Committee will be requested to raise funds for relief again, and the Ministry of Finance of the National Government will be requested to allocate funds for relief. In short, the government will do its best to provide assistance. He hopes that the gentlemen will tell the villagers not to misunderstand and to be careful not to overstep the boundaries.</p>

<p>Hu Hongji, the former director of the Municipal Health Bureau, died tragically in a car accident near Haiyan on his way from Shanghai to Hangzhou along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway on the 15th of last month. The Municipal Government believes that Mr. Hu has been in office for many years and has made outstanding achievements. In addition to issuing seven months' salary at the last monthly salary of Mr. Hu during his lifetime as a consolation payment to the director, a special consolation payment of 4,000 yuan will be allocated to commend his merits. As for the funeral expenses, 1,000 yuan has also been approved, all of which will be handed over to Mr. Hu's family for collection.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association specially formed a committee to solicit donations to comfort the anti-Japanese national army during the January 28th Shanghai War because of their hard work and great achievements. As a result of the solicitation from all members, a total of more than 34,800 yuan in cash was collected. However, more than 70 donation books have not been returned. The association has sent staff to urge the members who have not returned the donation books to return them. After deducting the huge amount of condolences and donations to the Northeast Volunteer Army and the nurturing association for the families of the war dead, there is still a surplus of more than 2,000 yuan, which is decided to be allocated to aid and rescue Northeast refugees. The association has sent a letter to the Northeast Refugee Relief Association to collect this surplus amount to relieve the suffering of the Northeast compatriots.</p>

<p>The Reply Stated That It Has Been Allocated Correctly</p>
<p>The Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association previously decided to allocate 3,000 yuan to the unit led by Zhou Han of the National Salvation Army. To be prudent, the funds were immediately entrusted to the Shanghai liaison office of the Command Headquarters of the Northeast National Salvation Army for transfer to the front line. Now, the director of the office, Pan Yunchao, sent a special letter to the Support Association yesterday, stating that it has been allocated correctly. The original letter said, "(To whom it may concern, Regarding the inquiry in your association's letter of November 1st about whether the funds for Zhou Han's unit have been allocated as requested, it has been verified that the funds were remitted long ago. According to the director of the association, Li Cichu, the funds must be delivered to the front line to show prudence. Therefore, this office transferred the funds to the Tianjin liaison office of our army for verification. Now, according to the previous reason, the Tianjin liaison office has been asked to inquire about the truth. If Zhou Han is indeed in Beipiao, the funds will of course be allocated correctly. This is to inform you in advance and hope you will check it.)"</p>

<p>The Shanghai General Office of the China Southeast Main Branch of the World Red Swastika Society sent a letter to the Shanghai Charity Organizations Joint Relief Association for Northeastern Refugees yesterday, respectfully stating that they received a letter from the Binjiang Branch stating that since August 7th, the Songhua and Nenjiang rivers in this port have been overflowing and flooding, causing the dikes to break. The prosperous city has suddenly become a swamp. The disaster is extremely severe and unprecedented in more than a hundred years. Thanks to the repeated relief efforts of various charitable groups, many lives have been saved. However, the disaster is severe and the period is long, so long-term planning is still needed. In addition to the existing porridge factories, the number of disaster victims should be reviewed and porridge factories should be added appropriately to avoid freezing and starvation. The association has prepared more than 4,000 sets of relief clothing. The Changchun Branch has already placed 5,000 sets of relief clothing. In addition, there are still 10,000 sets of relief clothing, totaling about 20,000 sets. Compared with the number of people, the difference is huge, and preparations should continue. The survey of the disaster area, until the end of September, roughly covered the upstream and downstream areas along the Songhua River, from Xiaojiangzi on the north bank of the Songhua River to the mouth of the Hulan River, about 120 miles east and west, and 40 miles north and south, totaling 193 villages, with approximately 3,200 households awaiting relief, totaling approximately 22,400 refugee women and children. In Jiangnan Fuyiadian, from 13th Street eastward to Taipingqiao Sankeshu Huangsanzuzi and other places, there are approximately 4,500 households, with approximately 27,400 refugees, women, and children awaiting relief, totaling 50,000 people. The shelters and porridge factories set up serve more than 7,000 people daily, requiring 50 train cars of millet per month, each car containing 30,000 catties, costing 800 yuan per car, totaling 40,000 yuan. It is estimated that 240,000 yuan will be needed for six months. The problem of emergency relief cannot be delayed in the slightest. The weather is getting colder rapidly, and the outside of the Great Wall is extremely cold. If the disaster victims do not die from the floods, they may die from hunger and cold. The association has tried its best to raise funds, but it is difficult to achieve universal coverage. Moreover, the counties bordering Jiang Province have also suffered from floods, and they should be rescued together regardless of boundaries. We hope to publicize widely and earnestly request various charitable groups to jointly provide relief, which will be of immeasurable merit. Accordingly, a copy of the letter is sent for your information and instructions.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Appeal for Bandit Disasters in Taihu and Susong, Anhui Province <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Temporary Righteous Relief Association for Disaster Areas in Henan, Anhui, and Hubei received a fast mail from the Anhui Taihu Post-Disaster Committee yesterday, stating that Taihu is connected to Yinghuo in the north and Xinshihuang in the west. Since the Red Bandits invaded last autumn, more than a thousand people have been killed and kidnapped in Baiyang Zhenjun Yuyu Wang Qiaxi Qiantan Qingtian Nanzhuang Yangsheng and other places. Clothing and food have been looted, the old and weak have been abandoned in ditches, and the young and strong have fled in all directions. The suffering has lasted for nearly a year. This time, the bandits from Jinjiazhai fled into the county, passing through the fourth, second, and third districts before fleeing to Susong and then to Huangjiaihe in the first district and Siqianhe in the fifth district. Thanks to Tang's blockage, they fled back to the second, third, and fourth districts from Susong. In total, each time the number of people was more than 10,000, occupying the area for about half a month. In addition, hundreds of miscellaneous groups have never had a peaceful day. Wherever they go, food and clothing are exhausted, and even utensils are destroyed and people are killed by fire. The remaining survivors have suffered another disaster. We beg your association to send personnel to provide relief, and also telegraph the Central Relief Committee and charitable groups in Beijing and Shanghai to provide relief. We are eagerly awaiting your command.</p>
<p>Also, a joint letter from the Susong County Party Department, Finance Bureau, Chamber of Commerce, Education Association, and District Offices stated that on October 7th, the remaining fierce bandits from Jinjiazhai suddenly invaded Susong from Xinshichun Zhangjiaxin in the northwest, which is connected to Hubei, Xinshichun, Huangmei, and Taihu. They entered the Changhe Kabei Bath area in the western part of the county. After the hunters did their best to resist, the bandit forces were too large and the strength of the county was too weak. On the evening of the 8th, they went straight to the Hankou and took Aikou Village via Bijiating. Our security team resisted for four hours, but due to insufficient strength, they retreated to the Erbu Temple and the county seat. The bandits went straight from Aikou to Hualiangting in Fengchezhuang and other places, fleeing into the Xiyuan Mountains. The people's houses, belongings, clothing, and food in the villages they passed were all looted. The 47th Division of the National Salvation Army, led by Li Guo, followed them into the Xiyuan Mountains. The bandits fled from the mountain roads into Zhifeng Henanchong Guyuan and other places in the Beixiang Yuanlin Village, robbing houses, setting fires, killing people, and committing robberies, which was even worse than when they entered the country. Fortunately, Tang Brigade Chen and Yang Yuan rushed to the rescue overnight and fought with the bandits. However, in the area where the bandits passed, the residences and people were left empty. Although they have tried every means to gather and seek a livelihood, the residences, livestock, clothing, and furniture are all gone. Winter is approaching, how will they survive? Moreover, the autumn harvest grain has been robbed and eaten. In this situation, they will inevitably die of starvation. We earnestly request your association to consider the hundreds of thousands of disaster victims who have suffered this catastrophe and have no means of living, and quickly provide emergency relief to save the refugees. We will be grateful beyond measure.</p>

<h3 id="e169">Shanghai Social Bureau Mediates Taikoo Labor Dispute Yesterday <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Wait for the Compradors to Meet and Determine Standards</p>
<p>Sign the Mediation Agreement Next Thursday</p>
<p>After the British Taikoo Company laid off middle-class workers on various Yangtze River routes, a labor dispute occurred, and the situation was very serious. The Central Committee and the Ministry of Industry ordered the municipal government to handle it properly. Although the government has mediated repeatedly, it has not been resolved. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 pm, the Social Bureau held another mediation session.</p>
<p>Mediation Process: Representatives Zhu Huanqing and Zhu Ruiqing of the China Shipping Mutual Aid Association, and Lu Rongzhi and Zhou Xiaoting of the Seafarers' Middle Class Guild attended. Representatives of middle-class workers from Taikoo and Jardine, China Merchants, and Datong attended as observers. Dai Youheng of the Municipal Party Committee was present. Zhu Guilin, a mediator from the Social Bureau, presided over the meeting, and Wang Zhiqin recorded the minutes. First, the chairman briefly stated that this case has been mediated repeatedly, but no progress has been made. Today's mediation hopes that everyone will make concessions in order to resolve the issue and avoid expansion. Then, the business director stated that although he has repeatedly requested the company, the company insists on not agreeing to the first item in accordance with the China Merchants Bureau's method, believing that if it cannot be implemented now, the five items proposed will be postponed. However, the business director hopes to devise a good plan to achieve a permanent solution. The labor representative stated that although the company is willing to postpone implementation, the workers hope to find a comprehensive and fundamental solution to avoid future disputes. The chairman and the party committee representative then strongly persuaded each side.</p>
<p>Principles Passed: The principles for resolution are determined as follows: 1. In the future, the Taikoo Company's middle-class workers on the Yangtze River routes will only fill vacancies and not be supplemented, in order to rectify the situation (the standards will be determined by the business director). 2. The business director will formulate service rules for middle-class workers, but they must be implemented after being approved by the主管官署. 3. If a dispute arises between the business director and the workers in the future, it should be submitted to the主管官署 for verification. Both parties agreed to the principles. However, the comprador representative requested that the consent of all the compradors be obtained and the standards for middle-class workers on each route be specified. Finally, the chairman announced the adjournment of the meeting. After the compradors pass the resolution at the meeting, another mediation signing meeting will be convened next Thursday.</p>

<p>Three Telegrams Sent Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai Sichuan Compatriot Association, yesterday (4th), saw the news that Wang Aoxi, a standing committee member of the association, had been arrested. In the afternoon, it convened an emergency joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees to discuss rescue measures.

It was decided to send three telegrams requesting unanimous assistance.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Anti-Drug Association Pays Attention to Fujian Province's Opium Public Sales <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>The China National Anti-Drug Association received a telegram from various anti-drug groups in Fujian Province yesterday, addressing the Shanghai National Anti-Drug Association, stating that Fujian Province is an opium-producing area, and the prohibition of planting is being vigorously implemented, but the voice of public sales has been repeated. In the spring, the provincial authorities set up a contraband inspection office and implemented it brazenly. Fortunately, various public groups and your association rose up to protest, sending letters and telegrams, and sternly criticizing them, so they gradually subsided. The people of Fujian were fortunate that the scourge of opium was eliminated, and they began to renew their plans for governance. However, according to the newspaper on October 30th, after the Department sent Zou to Fujian, he went to Xiamen and southern Fujian, which attracted the attention of local people. It was found that his mission was to discuss opium public sales. After obtaining the consent of all parties, it will be opened within days. Rumors are not without reason. Our association is sincerely afraid that the dead will recover and the scourge of opium will spread, harming the local area. There is nothing more important than this. Therefore, we dare to telegram your association to quickly telegram the Fujian military and political authorities to earnestly express their determination to vigorously ban opium, and solemnly announce it to dispel doubts and eliminate the scourge of opium. We are eagerly awaiting it. Fujian Anti-Drug Federation, Fuzhou National Anti-Drug Association, Provincial Anti-Opium Support Association of All Circles, bowing to you.</p>

<h3 id="e176">Qianzhuang Guarantor Counterfeits Seal to Obtain Funds <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Sun Rongde Substitutes Plum for Peach</p>
<p>Pan Housheng Files Criminal Lawsuit</p>
<p>It is customary in the Shanghai Qianzhuang industry that if a Qianzhuang customer has a guarantor, the Qianzhuang should send the customer's name, account number, and passbook to the guarantor, who in turn delivers the passbook to the customer. If the customer wants to stop transacting with the Qianzhuang, he should also send the passbook to the original guarantor to return it to the Qianzhuang to complete the procedure. This kind of circulation procedure is intended to clarify the guarantor's responsibility and has been practiced for many years with few malpractices. Recently, Pan Housheng, owner of the Shengho Xiang Store on Gansu Road, because of his financial dealings with the Lianyi Qianzhuang on Sichuan Road, followed the Qianzhuang industry practice and requested Sun Rongde, a shareholder and manager of the Xiefengyong Woolen and Foreign Goods Store in Zhengjia Bridge, to be his guarantor. At the end of February last year, because he no longer wanted to continue the financial dealings, Pan sent the transaction passbook to Sun Rongde, asking him to return it to the Lianyi Qianzhuang to complete the procedure. Unexpectedly, Sun not only did not return the passbook, but also falsely carved a seal with the words "Shengho Xiang," impersonating him to continue transacting with Lianyi, and defaulting on a huge amount of money from Lianyi. At first, the Qianzhuang did not know that Sun Rongde was cheating, but later, when settling the accounts, they learned of this substitution trick. Pan Housheng believed that Sun should not have falsely carved the Shengho Xiang seal, which was tantamount to fraud, so he hired lawyer Zhu Sitifei and filed a criminal lawsuit against Sun in the First Special District Local Court, requesting his arrest and punishment for forgery under Article 234 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang of the court opened a trial. After the plaintiff's lawyer Zhu Sifei explained the intention of the lawsuit, the court immediately questioned the two parties about the circumstances of the case and instructed them to go outside to conduct a reconciliation in order to settle the dispute. If a reconciliation cannot be reached, a date will be set for retrial.</p>

<p>Wang Defa and Wang Yinshan, the bandits who kidnapped the Hu surname, were sentenced by the First Special District Local Court, and the death sentences were approved by the Provincial Government. At 10:00 am yesterday, the court instructed the police station to escort the two criminals to the court. After verifying their identities, they were rewarded with wine and food, and then ordered to be escorted to the Second Prison in Caohejing. At the same time, the local court was asked to send Prosecutor Yang An as the supervising officer, and Chief Deputy Police Chief Chen Junfang was instructed to supervise the execution. Forensic police officers Gu Hanqing and Xue Bingzhang and others rushed to the execution ground. Wang Defa was brought forward to make a confession. He was 36 years old, from Songjiang. His family included his old mother, wife, three sons, and two daughters. After his death, he requested that a letter be sent to No. 16 Taqilong, Shizi Road, Hangzhou, and that his eldest son, Maifa, come to collect his body. He also said to his wife, Wang, to be fair, and that he had been harmed by Yang Delin, etc. Wang Yinshan confessed that he was 30 years old, from Huzhou. His family included his 58-year-old mother and two children, one five years old and one three years old. His younger brother, Ruisheng, was adopted by the Che family and lived in Wujiazhuang, Dananzha, Huzhou. He asked him to come and collect his body. He also said to his brothers not to be强横 and that they should always be kind. At this point, the official ordered the police to carry out the execution by firing squad.

After the sentencing, Attorney Tian Yinqi of the police station stated that Li Yucai, Ren Si, and eight others had committed numerous robberies in the French Concession. Detectives from the French Police Station were sent to the court to request their transfer. However, Ren Si is still facing a murder charge, and the police station will file a separate lawsuit. He requested a temporary detention. Detective Cui Zhenguo of the French Police Station submitted an official document stating that, with the exception of Ren Si, they requested the transfer of the remaining individuals. Judge Wu also ordered that Li Yucai, Yang Chunjiang, Feng Er, Sun Huarong, Sun Xiaogongzi, Wang Desheng, and the woman Wan Chenshi be handed over to Cui Zhenguo for transfer to the Second Special District Local Court of Jiangsu Shanghai.

<p>Traffickers Cai Laotai and Others Arrested</p>
<p>The Shanghai Public Security Bureau's Pujiang River Patrol Team recently discovered a female child trafficker, Zhu Chenshi, from Shaoxing, on the Hua'an Steamer traveling to Fuzhou and other places. She was accompanied by one boy and one girl. Upon interrogation, the boy claimed to be a four-year-old from Pudong. The girl, due to her young age, was vague. The girl claimed to be a twelve-year-old from Pudong, who had been kidnapped for a long time. Today, her mother brought them to the steamer to "play," obviously intending to traffic the children out of the country for sale. They were immediately taken into custody for investigation. After questioning by Chief Zhu, Zhu Chenshi confessed to being a servant in a Fujian family and that the two children were brought to Fuzhou at the request of her employer. As the case involved child trafficking for sale abroad, it was submitted to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau for investigation. The Third Section discovered that the child trafficking ring was extremely secretive and found that the kidnapped children were kidnapped by Cai Laotai, the mother-in-law of Guan Lao, a pimp at No. 49 Zhaxia Road, Nanshi, and her son Cai Xingchun (aka "Shoes A'jin"). Initially, they were hidden at No. 91 Houjiawan, Gaoqiao Buxing Street, and then resold to Fujian people by Zhang Lao Yi (aka "Little Jiangbei") who resided at No. 10 Dingxiang Lane, Lafayete Road. The number of locations for hiding the children was more than three. Detective Captain Lu Ying was ordered to secretly arrest them at their addresses. Yesterday, the child trafficking ring was completely busted, and all the traffickers, including Cai Laotai and 1,000 other traffickers, were arrested and handed over to the section for severe punishment.</p>

<p>Sentenced to Sixteen Years for Robbery</p>
<p>Murder Case Separately Prosecuted and Awaiting Re-examination</p>
<p>Robber Ren Si, from Haizhou, organized a gang at approximately 10:00 p.m. on the evening of June 14 of last year, robbing the Weng Tanzhuo Pawnshop at No. 1384 Dong Yangshupu Road of jewelry and silver coins valued at over 250 yuan. While escaping, he opened fire to resist arrest, fatally wounding Indian constable No. 216. He was apprehended by Detective Lu Gengsheng and sent to the First Special District Court. The robbery portion of the case resulted in a sentence of sixteen years of imprisonment. The murder case was separately prosecuted by the police station's attorney. After the incident, the police station arrested the robbers Xu Guozhu and others, who confessed and mentioned Ren Si. However, the defendant claimed at the police station that Yang Er, who was still at large, fired the shot that killed the Indian constable. He stated that he was waiting on a boat at the Pingliang Road pier and received a silver watch and eight yuan in stolen goods. Wang Beiji, the representative of the pawnshop, testified that four robbers came that night, two had pistols, three entered the store to rob, and one stood guard outside. The description of the robber resembled the defendant. Upon questioning, Ren Si stated, "I admitted to having stolen goods at the police station, but that was nonsense. Yang Er invited me to rob, and the shooting was not my fault." His testimony was evasive. Judge Wu Zhen ordered that he be returned to custody and re-examined at a later date.</p>

Since the start of the service, the number of passengers has been increasing day by day. In addition to the original "Conte Rosso" and "Gange" vessels, the company has transferred the largest and fastest new postal ship "Conte Verde" from Italy to Shanghai to increase capacity in order to meet the demand. Yesterday, the company invited people from all walks of life in Shanghai to visit the new ship. Many Chinese and Westerners attended. The ship also provided refreshments. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Beautiful Ship Body The "Conte Verde" is a newly built express postal ship with a tonnage of 19,000 tons, which is larger than the "Conte Rosso". The beauty of the layout of the first-class cabins, dining halls, halls, dance halls, writing rooms, smoking rooms, gyms, children's rooms, etc. on the ship is truly superior to that of a palace. The carpets are made of silk, and the utensils are specially made. Every table and chair is valuable. The first-class rooms are also equipped with bathrooms, which are spacious and comfortable. It is unprecedentedly excellent postal ship in Central Europe. Moreover, it has a very high speed and can travel 23 nautical miles per hour. It only takes 44 hours from Shanghai to Hong Kong and only 23 days to Italy. It can be called a sea palace on the Central European route.</p>
<p>Crowded with Guests The ship arrived in Shanghai one day and stopped at the Qichang Wharf in Pudong. Yesterday afternoon at 5:00 p.m., the company specially sent two small steamships to the Xinguang Wharf to welcome the guests who came to visit. There were one thousand several hundred Chinese and Westerners, including Huang Boqiao, Beide Post Office Manager Bilu, Chamber of Commerce Chairman Wang Xiaolai, Taikoo Dabang Paileis, Zheng Jun, representatives from the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, etc. Luso, the general manager of the Italian Post Office, Xie Li Gelanxi, and Chinese directors Shao Cai hosted the guests warmly on the ship and guided the visit. Italian Minister to China, Qi Yinuo, also came to the ship and mingled among the guests.</p>
<p>Treating the Guests The ship specially prepared tea, snacks, and Western food, and a dance floor and dining hall were opened on Deck B. Many Chinese and Western guests participated in the dance. Then, they had dinner until 7:30 p.m. before sending the guests back to Shanghai. The ship is scheduled to depart on its maiden voyage to Italy on the 7th of this month. It is reported that Lieutenant General Kai Lai, Commander of the Far East Fleet of the British Navy, will take the ship to Europe. Mr. Zhang Fakui, the Fourth Army Commander of China, will take the ship from Hong Kong to Italy, and then transfer to Germany and France.</p>

<p>Jiang Xiaozhuzi Died</p>
<p>Jiang Xiaozhuzi, the four-year-old daughter of Jiang Mao, a woman from Jiangbei living at No. 20 Jiaotong Lane, Baoshan Road, Zhabei, was raped a week ago, injuring her lower body. Jiang Mao reported the case to the Second Police Station of the Fifth District, accusing Hu Xuan亭 of rape, assisted by Hu's wife, Hu Liao. Hu and his wife were arrested and argued that a four-year-old child would not consent to rape, and they would not abandon his own wife and instead ask her to help rape this four-year-old child. They said they were being falsely accused. The case was sent to the local court the day before yesterday. Hu and his wife were released on bail at that time. Unexpectedly, the girl died on the 3rd of this month. Jiang Mao filed a lawsuit in court, and the court immediately ordered the arrest of Hu and his wife. Yesterday, the child's body was sent to the Zhenru Forensic Department of the Ministry of Justice for autopsy by the forensic doctor for verification.</p>

<p>Discovered by a Car Dealership</p>
<p>Ni Renqing, from Shaoxing, went to the American-owned Xintong Automobile Company at No. 1 Albert Road in the French Concession a few days ago to purchase a Chevrolet car. The agreed price was three thousand taels of silver. He paid with two forged drafts totaling three thousand five hundred taels of silver, intending to have the car dealership return five hundred taels. His fraudulent act was discovered, and he was arrested and sent to the Second Special Court. The case was ordered to be heard at a later date. The details were reported in the previous newspaper. He was questioned again yesterday. Tao Rubie, a detective from the Xinzha Police Station in the British Concession, testified that the defendant Ni Renqing had used two forged drafts totaling four thousand taels from the Cunde Zhuang on July 1st of last year to purchase a car from Buick Automobile Company at No. 499 Jing'an Temple Road. The agreed price was three thousand five hundred taels, and he asked the car dealership to return a check for five hundred taels in an attempt to defraud. The car dealership owner discovered the fraud and reported it to the police, but he had not been apprehended. Unexpectedly, the defendant Ni Renqing attempted to defraud the Xintong car dealership again. Xintong is a branch of the Buick car dealership, so he was arrested on the spot. He requested permission to transfer the case for investigation and handling. Ni confessed to the attempted fraud and hired lawyer Li Yuan to defend him. Judge Wu ordered that the defendant be handed over to the detective and taken away for investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e207">Letter to the Editor <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>To the Editor: In your newspaper's local news section on the 4th of this month, you published a report about the death of a patrolman from our factory. The facts stated in that report are, upon verification, largely inconsistent with the situation at the time. We hereby list the inaccuracies as follows: 1. The female worker Zhang Wangshi resisted inspection and grabbed the patrolman Ren Yuanshun's collar. She was persuaded to stop, and the patrolman did not slap her face. As for Fu Rusong and Ru Gaoge being detained, it was because the two of them, taking advantage of the crowd gathered at the factory gate, first broke into the gate and violently attacked Ren Yuanshun, leading to their detention. They were neither hung up nor pursued. 2. When the deceased, Chen Huahai, fell to the ground injured, his head was towards the factory wall and his feet towards the river. At that time, all those outside the factory gate were workers and nearby idlers. All patrolmen remained inside the gate. Since the deceased's head was facing inwards, it can be seen that the bullet came from outside. Furthermore, when patrolman Zhou Zhangmu saw Chen being shot down, he fired his gun in self-defense. The bullet hit the cement on the factory gate, and the traces are still there for verification. 3. The deceased, Chen Huahai, was not carrying a gun at the time. The gun was found later in his bedroom and taken away by the Sixth District police chief. 4. The population in the Tanzizhen area is very mixed, and they often create trouble with the factory. When this incident occurred, there were many idlers gathered in front of the factory gate. While the workers may be said to be unarmed, can it be guaranteed that those outside the factory were also unarmed? The above are the actual facts at the time. Your newspaper's account, we believe, was due to the reporter mistakenly adopting hearsay. Therefore, we specially send this letter to your chief editor, requesting that the above facts be published in the "Letter to the Editor" column to provide a correction and reveal the truth. Respectfully, to the Shen Bao newspaper, from Yong Yu Heji Textile Company, November 4th.</p>
<p>Special Document</p>
<h3 id="e208">Judge Feetham's Report on Conditions in the Shanghai International Settlement, Volume IV (13) <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>15. The aforementioned regulations are further supplemented by certain rules or budgetary ordinances, such as the following:</p>
<p>(The Council shall not vote on any expense unless the Finance Committee has considered it and submitted a report.)</p>
<p>In addition, there is another safeguard to prevent the Council from committing to increased expenditure based on suggestions that have not been financially considered. This is the regulation often stipulating that individual Councillors' suggestions (which would result in increased Council expenditure) should be subject to a procedure for submission to a committee for consideration (Note 6).</p>
<p>Taking the Health Committee as an example, according to the rules mentioned in the previous section, any suggestion regarding the adoption of public health measures must be submitted to the Health Committee for consideration. If the committee's report is in favor, then according to the rules cited in Section 14 above, the funds required for the expenditure due to the adoption of the Health Committee's suggestion must also be reported by the Finance Committee. Therefore, the Council has two layers of safeguards to prevent the acceptance of any suggestions involving expenditure whose results have not been thoroughly studied.</p>
<p>16. I therefore recommend that any plan for the development of the committee system should specifically consider how to define the functions of the Finance Committee of the Public Works Department through rules of procedure or other ordinances, and how to charge the committee with the same responsibilities as those stipulated in the regulations and rules I have cited (Note 7).</p>
<p>(Note 1) See Item 10 of the reform plan proposed in Chapter VI of Part 5 of this report.</p>
<p>(Note 2) This type of expenditure is classified as basic expenditure.</p>
<p>(Note 3) Regarding this argument, please refer to the following financial regulations. According to these regulations, under a more fully developed committee system, the relevant committee must submit recommendations to the Council before proceeding with matters prepared in the annual budget proposal.</p>
<p>(If the committee believes that the time has come to proceed with the matters prepared in the annual budget proposal or to implement the purchases prepared in the budget, the committee must first submit this recommendation for proceeding or purchasing to the Council, specifying the items mentioned in the budget proposal, and request the Council's approval.) (Johannesburg Municipal Financial Ordinance, Article 10)</p>
<p>(Note 4) I believe that it is unnecessary to quote the part of the statement specifically discussing this type of regulation, as that part specifies the details that should be listed in the register of items to be purchased (including the estimated prices) and includes various rules regarding soliciting quotations and inviting bids, as well as various provisions for ordering in emergencies.</p>
<p>(Note 5) See Appendix 42(A).</p>
<p>(Note 6) See Appendix 42(B)(3).</p>
<p>(Note 7) See Appendix 42(C) for a sample of the scope of authority of the Finance Committee.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Chapter III Appointment and Tasks of Auditors <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>1. The issue of auditing the Public Works Department's accounts has been previously discussed (Note 1) and pointed out (Note 2). Although the Land Regulations stipulate (Article 12) that (the accounts of the Board of Directors shall be audited) and that (the results of the audit) shall be announced at the annual meeting, there are no regulations regarding how the auditors should be selected, how they should be compensated, or what their position is in terms of tenure security. What has been noted as necessary (Note 3) is that regulations should be added regarding the appointment and qualifications of auditors, the nature of their tasks, and the security of their tenure, so that the independence of the auditors' position can be permanently guaranteed.</p>
<p>2. In the proposed reform plan C, two levels of recommendations were made regarding this issue: (1) Auditors should be elected by the annual meeting of taxpayers in the future. To avoid difficulties arising from the inability of the two taxpayers' meetings (foreign and Chinese) to agree on the same candidate, a provision may be established that if they cannot agree, the two taxpayers' meetings may elect their respective auditors. (2) The tasks of the auditors must also be defined, and the nature of the report that must be prepared when verifying the annual revenue and expenditure accounts must also be disclosed.</p>
<p>3. According to the provisions of the existing Land Regulations, the accounts of the Public Works Department (shall be audited). Although this provision seems to have been interpreted as meaning that the accounts of the Public Works Department should be independently audited by suitably qualified individuals who are neither employees of the Public Works Department nor directors of the Board of Directors, the meaning of this interpretation is not explicitly stated in the regulations. Therefore, it is necessary to clearly stipulate it, so as not to violate the practice that has been implemented and to ensure that the principle of independent auditing is permanently acknowledged.</p>
<p>4. The implementation of this principle is of particular importance in the International Settlement, because the system of having public authorities' accounts independently audited by legitimate individuals and publishing the results annually for public inspection is rarely recognized in China.</p>
<p>5. Any system for auditing public accounts that is sufficient, to a certain extent, to ensure sound and honest financial management must possess the following characteristics:</p>
<p>(1) The auditor should have the proper qualifications to perform the duties of an auditor. The auditor should be in an independent position with respect to the government office or agency whose accounts they are auditing.</p>
<p>(2) The auditor should have sufficient power to facilitate the auditing process. (3) The results of the audit should be published for public knowledge.</p>
<p>6. The maintenance of this system in the International Settlement, in addition to benefiting the handling of matters within the Settlement, is sufficient to demonstrate the value of this system for general public administration in practice (Note 5) and to promote the expansion of the scope of recognition of this value.</p>
<p>7. I will now discuss in detail the regulations that need to be added regarding the issue of auditing the Public Works Department's accounts, in order to supplement the recommendations that have already been made.</p>
<p>A. Qualifications of Auditors and Methods of Appointment</p>
<p>8. I now suggest that a regulation should be established to ensure that the personnel used to audit the accounts of the Public Works Department should be suitably qualified individuals who are neither directors nor employees of the Public Works Department. The term "suitably qualified individuals" should be interpreted as referring to individuals who, according to their national laws, are recognized as being able to perform the duties of accountants and auditors and who have been performing these duties in Shanghai for at least five years.</p>
<p>9. It has been suggested above that future auditors should be elected by the annual meeting of taxpayers, and that the election should be conducted by voting. If the plan to hold separate annual meetings for Chinese and foreign taxpayers is adopted, then each of these annual meetings will have the right to elect auditors. If the two annual meetings cannot agree on electing the same individual as auditor, then there may be two auditors. As far as I know, this method has been adopted in auditing the accounts of Shanghai companies, and apart from the additional expenditure involved, there is no serious objection in practical terms.</p>
<p>10. Regarding the election of auditors by the taxpayers' meeting, a rule must be established to ensure that the list of nominated auditor candidates is submitted to the Board of Directors several days before the meeting, so that there is sufficient time to review the qualifications of each candidate and notify the voters of the nominated candidates. I suggest that the list of nominated candidates should be submitted to the Board of Directors at least three weeks before the scheduled date of the election of auditors. This list should be signed by a prescribed number of taxpayers who are qualified to vote at the taxpayers' meeting. The task of reviewing this list is to determine whether the persons nominated are qualified. This review should be entrusted to a committee of the Board of Directors or an auditor appointed by the Board of Directors. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e210">Reserving Seats <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>The grand and lively 10th World Olympic Games have passed, and the 11th is scheduled to be held in Berlin in 1936. According to a Berlin telegram: It is said that although the next Olympic Games are far away, many member states have already reserved seats in Berlin with the World Sports Committee. Among them, students from a certain middle school in the United States have purchased 1,000 of the best seats. The news sparked a discussion between Mr. A and Mr. B:</p>
<p>Mr. A said: American students' concept of sports is almost like a second life. The year 1936 is still four years away, but they have seriously pre-purchased 1,000 excellent seats. How far-sighted are American students! How strong and enthusiastic is the American students' interest in the Olympics!</p>
<p>Mr. B said: Seeing others, I think of myself. China is also one of the member states of the 10th Olympic Games, but only Liu Changchun participated in the games, which shows the indifference of the Chinese to world sports! Even those who participate in the games are not so enthusiastic; even less do they pre-purchase seats.</p>
<p>Mr. X, who was listening nearby, came over and said a few witty words:</p>
<p>You shouldn't boost others' morale and diminish your own prestige! Who said that there are no Chinese students who pre-purchase seats for the Olympics? The three male students next door to my humble abode and the three female students next door have reserved good seats for the Olympics many times. Although they didn't pre-purchase 1,000 excellent seats, they always pre-purchase six seats each time, more than 20 times a month. Their interest in the Olympics is no less than that of American students!</p>
<p>Mr. A and Mr. B didn't know that he was speaking wittily, but they asked him in detail about the reason.</p>
<p>Don't doubt it, let me tell you the truth; the good seats reserved by the male and female students next door are not the seats for the Olympic Games, but the seats in the Paramount Theater during the summer; ha ha!</p>
<p>Mr. X said with a smile.</p>
<h3 id="e211">Chairman Lin <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Fu Hongmeng</p>
<p>—Two Things on the Way Back South—</p>
<p>According to general speculation, Chairman Lin's return south this time has something to do with the political situation in Fujian Province. In fact, Chairman Lin is just Chairman Lin, and the political situation in Fujian Province is just the political situation in Fujian Province. Everyone is not related. Yesterday, a friend came to Shanghai from Fujian and told the readers about the two greatest events in Chairman Lin's return to the south, so that they can be used as materials for writing celebrity anecdotes in the future.</p>
<p>1. Recommendation of Staff Members. Chairman Lin is, after all, a good gentleman. When he arrived in Fuzhou, he felt that after returning to his hometown for many years, it was not easy to comfort the villagers. After all, he was a little embarrassed, so he issued two handwritten notes, introducing Shao Junping as the inspector of the Public Security Bureau and Lin Dazhan as the deputy director of the Advertising Management Office of the Public Security Bureau. Unexpectedly, the Public Security Bureau was recently reorganized. It is said that the two members recommended by Chairman Lin are uneasy about their positions. It is a pity that the commemoration left by Chairman Lin's return to the south cannot last forever!</p>
<p>2. Clam Salted Beltfish. Although Chairman Lin has a high position and salary, he has never forgotten the taste of his hometown. This time he returned to the south, he brought a lot of local flavors of clams (hard shells like clams) and salted beltfish, so everyone competed to offer these two things to him. As a result, clams suddenly sold for ten copper coins per catty, and salted beltfish cost half a price per head. This is also the most memorable thing. It is said that these two things are the greatest in Chairman Lin's return to the south, so we also have a record of the price!</p>
<h3 id="e212">Mahjong Sutra <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Qiu Zhaowei</p>
<p>—One of the National Treasures—</p>
<p>Chinese people like to gamble, using gambling as a pastime, entertainment, and a means of making a living. Among these (gambling entertainments), mahjong is the most advanced, elegant, and widespread. Nowadays, young girls of thirteen or fourteen in urban middle-class families certainly understand (the Mahjong Sutra). If you walk into a tea house in a remote village, you will definitely hear the sound of mahjong. From scholars and officials to peddlers and porters, men and women, old and young, all walks of life, if you don't know mahjong, what a (wronged death)! (Bamboo battle) (Game of the square city), what elegant terms! I have nothing to call it, I call it (National Gambling) or (National Art), to join the ranks of (National Treasures), but my intention is not to promote it.</p>
<p>It is said that in a certain period, mahjong was appreciated by Westerners, so it was exported in batches, and many people became rich and famous by serving as mahjong instructors for Westerners. This is really a great and glorious thing.</p>
<p>Therefore, even if China perishes, China's art, mahjong, will be immortal forever!</p>
<p>Chinese people are the most leisurely, gentle, and particular about entertainment; and Chinese people are also the smartest and most able to (fight wits). Mahjong is really the most suitable thing. Chinese people are talented mahjong players. Hundreds of years ago, the Chinese created mahjong, passed it down from generation to generation, and have promoted it to the world, which is as great as queues, small feet, and opium smoking. Just imagine, four people are sitting around a square table, plus (spectators), concentrating, with uncertain hands and eyes, like crazy and obsessed all night long. Chinese entertainment is a symbol of the state of lung disease! The Chinese are a nation with lung disease through and through!</p>
<p>I tell you, in terms of (fighting wits), the Japanese are much stronger than our compatriots. Although we have many mahjong veterans, they may not lose when playing mahjong with the Japanese. They also have works such as (Advanced Tactics of Mahjong Game) (Secret of Chinese Mahjong Battle), but we don't, which should be a shame.</p>
<h3 id="e213">Talking About Cigarette Butts <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— A Middle School Student</p>
<p>—Also a Kind of Skill—</p>
<p>No matter who it is, you must have a skill to make a living. If you don't have a special skill, then you will only starve to death. Even picking up cigarette butts requires a special skill. If you don't reach a high level, you may not even get two cents for picking up cigarette butts all day long. According to those who are experienced in picking up cigarette butts, they have been picking up cigarette butts for more than ten years. The number of cigarette butts they have picked up before and after is no less than hundreds of thousands. He goes to pick up cigarette butts in the area of ​​the Dongxin Bridge in the French Concession every afternoon after eating. On average, he can pick up one every two steps. But although the income is large, the quality is very poor. This is probably because the cigarette brands are mostly (Lianzhu brand) (Golden Mouse brand), etc.!</p>
<p>From south to Xiafei Road, from afternoon to midnight, it can be said that the pedestrians are endless. There are people of the upper, middle and lower classes. Therefore, the cigarette butts picked up can also be divided into three classes｜upper, middle and lower. Generally (compradors) (young masters) often discard them on the ground after smoking only half a cigarette. The butts are long and the quality of the cigarette is good. Most of them are (Carillac) (White Snow Pack), etc. This kind of cigarette butt can be regarded as the upper class. The general middle class mostly smoke (Beauty Brand) (Red Snow Pack), etc. The butts are neither long nor short. This kind of cigarette butt can be regarded as middle class. As for the lower class, they also want to stroll on the road and open their eyes. But the cigarettes they smoke have short butts and poor quality.</p>
<p>Nanjing Road is a gathering place for general foreign masters. Especially in the area of ​​the Rising Sun Building. The cigarettes smoked by foreign masters are of course foreign cigarettes｜at least one dollar a pack. And foreigners are very generous. They throw them away after taking a few puffs. If you are lucky, you can sell the cigarette butts you pick up every day for more than one dollar!</p>
<p>After nine o'clock, the general night owls began to move. Groups of (Shanghai young masters) (modern young ladies) (social stars) all walked into this soul-destroying place. Before they walk in, they must throw the cigarette butts outside first. You only need to guard a few hours, and you are guaranteed to return fully loaded. And they are all top-quality goods.</p>

<p>— Yun</p>
<p>—Fruit Trees Worth Introducing—</p>
<p>I am a follower of Tao Yuanming. Because the place where I live is only suitable for walking on the road of agriculture, I am engaged in agricultural affairs, but the result of the engagement is always failure. In the spring of the 14th year of the Republic of China, I bought a lot of fruit trees in Ningbo and started my agricultural work. The garden I planted was 20 acres, and the fruit trees I planted were 1,500 trees. When I first planted fruit trees, I estimated that I would definitely make a fortune after three years? Unexpectedly, in the third year, because the fruits were too small and the taste was not good, I could not exchange them for money. This was my first failure. Later, I bought 1,000 peach seedlings in Shanghai. In the third year, the result was the same as last time. I suffered these two major failures. The heart of returning to farming had long been cold.</p>
<p>In the spring of the year before last, I had a friend who bought dozens of kinds of fruit trees from Hefeng Agricultural and Forestry Farm in Pinghu. He took one tree of each kind and sent it to me for trial planting. After planting it, I felt that it was developing very well. This is only the second year, and the peaches have already borne very large and sweet fruits. My heart of returning to farming suddenly turned from cold to hot again. Therefore, I ordered 2,000 trees from Hefeng Agricultural and Forestry Farm in Pinghu, preparing to carry out my third planting work. I will also talk about these few sentences to introduce to comrades. (Pay respect)</p>

<p>2. After Adapting to the Times</p>
<p>This series of orders exhausted Aigu again. Fortunately, she had a strong memory. She agreed, walked out, and tried to memorize the important and difficult to understand technical terms, chanting (lotus seed soup), (electric stove), (coal stove). When she arrived in the kitchen, she was fortunate enough not to disgrace her mission and told the newcomer one by one. However, she switched the (electric stove) and (coal stove). The newcomer had actually been here for a year, and stewing white fungus, lotus seed soup, and bird's nest porridge for the master had become a regular routine. So she corrected her mistake and said, (Sister Aigu, the coal stove is here. Go get the dabbing water equipment).</p>
<p>(Dabbing water equipment)! This term made her hesitate again. Probably a washbasin. That's easy. She had one at home, but it had a few holes, which could not be repaired. She had already replaced it with fifty sheets of grass paper. The image would not fade. She went to the bedroom and found one. Naturally, it was big, smooth, and beautiful. In the same place, there was also a white porcelain one, which was very deep, large, and uneven. She didn't know what it was for. Later, an idea came to her mind, and she guessed that it was for cold water. She hurried to the kitchen and dabbed it, placed it on the table, and said to the young mistress Han, (The water is here).</p>
<p>Young mistress Han rolled over and pushed aside the quilt, put on her slippers, and went to the table. Seeing that the cold water and hot water were all in place, she wiped the tables, chairs, spittoons, vases, bowls, and dishes around her clean, and praised happily, (Pay attention everywhere, you can do it). Aigu was relieved and became extraordinarily energetic! She was about to tidy up the (ivory bed) with the (harmony quilt). But she saw that in the bed quilt, there was also a young master hiding. She didn't pay attention, and accidentally lifted half of the quilt head, catching a glimpse of a fleshy leg. She quickly let go. The young master had already noticed it, turned around, opened his eyes, looked at her a few times, and smiled slightly. For some reason, Aigu felt like she had been electrocuted, lost her senses, and later felt that she was standing in front of a man's bed. It was very embarrassing. She hurried away, like watching the young mistress washing her face, probably not noticing. She felt relieved. But she always felt a little strange about the young master. It was (fear), not (shame), or something else. In short, she had three points of (prevention).</p>

<h3 id="e216">Financial Gold Market in Calm <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>Rising Three Taels and One Mace　　Yesterday's market was calm with little change. The daily high and low prices differed by no more than three taels. The final result was a rise of three taels and one mace compared to the previous day. Market sentiment was still good, with buying and selling from various parties. Except for the Guangdong group's overall selling, the remaining transactions were not large. The price rose from the early morning, mainly because the price of silver bars rose very slightly, and the silver price did not move. Later, it only fluctuated by a little over one tael, probably because the foreign exchange rate was tightening. However, Hengxing's selling intention was still strong, which hindered the price from advancing. The market was firm at first but then declined, as the U.S. dollar strengthened and then leveled off. However, the overall situation was peaceful, with fluctuations of no more than a little over one tael. Finally, it stood at around forty-seven taels. The November contract was transferred from the short seller Huiyuan to Dafeng Heng in dozens of lots, with a discount of one tael and eight mace. The detailed situation of the market before and after is recorded below.</p>
<p>Opening Up Three Taels and Eight Mace　　In the early morning, the December contract opened up three taels and eight mace to seven hundred and forty-seven taels and five mace. This was mainly because the silver price had not risen as expected yesterday, and the exchange rate was also more than one point higher. Hengxing sold off, and the East Asia Bank sold U.S. dollars for January at 30 yuan, and Banque Belge sold February at 0.0625. It had already fallen to forty-six taels and three mace, but within ten minutes, it rebounded by a few mace. Subsequently, buyers were eager, such as Zhaofeng Chang, Hengyu, Daxing Yong, Tianfeng Yong, Yuanxing Yong, Futaixing, Hengfu Chang, Yifeng Yong, etc. Hengxing also bought in dozens of lots, because the limit price was not easy to obtain, especially as the January U.S. dollar was strong. Andar absorbed 0.9375, and HSBC absorbed 0.675 for this month, so the price jumped by more than two taels, reaching forty-eight taels and eight mace at 9:30. The British pound was quoted at a discount of 0.125, and the U.S. dollar at 0.25. However, the old Citibank suddenly came out with U.S. dollars for December at 0.8125, coupled with the selling by Bingxing, Zhifeng Yong, and the Dalian group, so it fell back to seven taels and one mace. Not long after, Zhaofeng Chang and hedgers bought in, reaching eight taels at 10:00. Hengxing continued to sell three to four hundred lots. Zhaofeng Chang, Dadecheng, Yuantai Yuanmao Yong, etc., all sold off, but the foreign exchange market was flat, so it plummeted to six taels and seven mace. Hongkang Yong and retail investors came in, and U.S. dollars for January at 0.9375 were available for sale. At 10:30, it was seven taels and nine mace. Hengxing sold again, and Yuankangxiang and Dadecheng followed suit. At almost 11:00, it was six taels and eight mace. Afterwards, Yifeng Yongfuchang Qianchangxiang Hongkang Yong and general retail investors covered their shorts. At 11:15, it was pushed up to eight taels and one mace, but later it was mediocre, and trading was also sparse. Hengxing sold again and again, so it retreated to seven taels and two mace. Then it closed at seven taels and four mace.</p>
<p>Afternoon Market Extremely Peaceful　　The afternoon market opened at forty-seven taels and two mace. Later, Dadecheng Zhifengyong Hengyu Zhaofengchang and others bought in, adding one tael, to eight taels and four mace. Subsequently, Yuanmaoyong Hengyu Hengxing and others all sold off. The wheat firm sold U.S. dollars for December at 0.8125 to Citibank, and Andar sold British pounds at 0.6875. At 2:45, it was seven taels and two mace. Until 3:00, the market was quite flat. Later, Zhifengyong Yifengyong Daxingyong and others all bought in, and the wheat firm absorbed 30 yuan for February, and Citibank absorbed 0.6875 for November. It was also rumored that the Central Bank was opening spot trading, and market sentiment was boosted. At 3:45, it was eight taels and nine mace. Afterwards, Hengyu Yuanheng Kangyong and others took the stage to sell off. The industrial bank came out with U.S. dollars for February at 30 yuan, reversing by two and a half taels, to six taels and four mace at 4:20. After a while, it pulled up four or five mace. When the market closed at 4:30, it was forty-six taels and eight mace, three taels and one mace higher than the previous day. According to the entire day, the maximum was eight taels and nine mace, and the minimum was six taels and three mace, a difference of two taels and six mace. If Hengxing had not sold, the price might have been possible outside of fifty taels. The red bar still added eleven taels.</p>
<p>Revealed Price Suppressed to Seventy Taels　　The revealed price was 0.25 less for the U.S. dollar, so it was eight hundred and seventeen taels, a discount of about seventy taels. In the afternoon, it was seventy taels to sixty-eight taels, and finally seventy taels, three taels more than the previous day. Registered loan was forty-nine taels to forty-seven taels, and the water supplement was forty-eight taels throughout the day.</p>
<p>Transactions Vary Among Brokers　　Transactions varied on the trading floor. Statistics show that Fuchang Hengyu and Hongkang Yong each bought in four to five hundred lots. Yifeng Yong Tianfeng Yong Futaixing Daxing Yong Zhaofeng Chang Zhifeng Yong and Fuxing Yong all pulled in. Tongtaichang bought in more than three hundred lots. Shunli Shenkang Yuantai Yuanmaoyong and Bingxing all sold off. Dadecheng sold off six to seven hundred lots. In the afternoon, Zhifengyong Daxingyong Yuankangxiang and Wanxing all bought in. Hengyu Zhaofeng Chang Dadecheng Yifeng Yong Fuyu's buying and selling varied. Yuanheng Yuanmaoyong Hongkang all sold off. The Dalian group's buying and selling throughout the day was six to seven hundred lots. The Guangdong group (Hengxing) sold about one thousand three hundred in the morning market and bought in dozens of lots. In the afternoon market, it sold more than two hundred lots, and now it has turned short by two to three thousand lots, it is said.</p>

The U.S. dollar was tight in the morning, flat at noon, and slightly firm in the early afternoon, but later seemed looser.

Trading was active among various banks, but the British pound was only several tens of thousands of pounds, mostly interbank trading. The U.S. dollar was about six to seven hundred thousand dollars. The gold market's supply exceeded demand, with occasional arbitrage transactions. The arbitrage price for December and January was about forty-eight to forty-nine taels, but the final result was a discount of just under seventy taels.

<p>｜Slight Fluctuations, Peaceful Trend｜</p>
<p>Yesterday's bond market situation at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange showed that spot transactions were sparse, with only 12,000 yuan traded throughout the day. The futures market was far from its previous activity. Although December futures for various bonds had mostly opened, prices turned sluggish, and market sentiment was very depressed. Buying and selling transactions became very idle. The trading volume was just over 1.4 million in the morning market and 1.2 million in the afternoon market, totaling only 2.635 million yuan. Internal salt tax accounted for about 500,000, troop reduction unified tax 400,000 each, and the remainder was around 200,000 yuan. Customs 96.6 was very scarce. As for the situation of various bonds, the domestic and international situations have not developed in new ways recently, the bond market environment is more depressing than before, and market sentiment is waiting and seeing, so the turnover has become sparse, and the price has become very sluggish. The front and rear markets only fluctuated by a few jiao, and only rose or fell by one or two jiao compared to the previous day. However, spot customs duties rose nearly three yuan compared to last month. Judging from the situation of the bond market, it will be difficult to have large fluctuations temporarily, it is said.</p>

<p>Xinfeng Yangxing reported that on Thursday (3rd), the New York Stock Exchange saw a sharp decline in wheat, and all stocks fell in unison. Later, Homes Tooke's gold stocks rose by $19.25, creating a new high price of 132 for the stock. The public took it as a symbol of the good domestic situation, and market sentiment improved, so the market reversed. Currently, the prices of various stocks have not yet broken through the support line of October 10, but it is difficult to determine whether this situation can last for long. The brokers' loans announced this week totaled 362,000,000 yuan, an increase of 10,000,000 yuan compared to last week, which is a phenomenon of reduced investors and increased speculators. The interest rates for 60-day and 90-day loans are still 5%. The trading volume today was 1 million shares. The Dow Jones index is listed on the left.</p>

<p>The long-brewing yarn market suddenly found a new low price. Due to the extremely poor environment and stalled actual sales, buyers were uneasy. As for foreign cotton, it was also flat, so sellers took advantage of the situation to pursue it, and the market showed instability, and the decline wind suddenly weaved. However, the Rongxing bulls are still struggling. In short, the overall situation is not good, and the trend is downward, it is said.</p>
<p>Human Standard Falls 1.4 Taels Human standard opened in the morning market. Due to the softening of U.S. cotton and depressed market sentiment, there was a lack of buyers, and the market showed fluctuations. Each month fell by 1 tael to 1 tael and 1 qian.

<p>The long-wandering cotton market suddenly plummeted today. Due to the weakness of U.S. cotton, the domestic economy is extremely tight, yarn sales are sluggish, factories are suspending the purchase of spot cotton, and a certain manufacturer is throwing out a large amount, the pressure is particularly heavy. The recent deterioration of the environment has led to buyers showing fluctuations, and general retail investors, seeing the situation too bad, are forced to close out. As a result, the market decline is particularly intense, and the current month has fallen below the 30 tael mark.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Drops Sharply by Five or Six Qian Zheng Standard opened in the morning market. With U.S. cotton flat and weak, and a lack of buyers in the market, the market trended down, and the situation was also panic. Each month fell by 4 or 5 qian.

<p>Over thirty stores in Shanghai South Xiang Road are adding inventory. Yao rice temporarily rose by one foot in Changxi help. Su Tong help sales were fast with steady prices. Du Jian and Yang Jian rice are in the downstream in a soft situation. The whole day was about 2000 shi.</p>
<p>Thirty-three or thirty-four ships of cargo arrived from Suzhou River banks of Xinzha. There was a slight transaction between urban and rural areas.

<h3 id="e227">Marked Flour Discovers a Huge Decline <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday after the opening of the flour market in the morning and afternoon, the prices of each month saw a huge decline again. The volume of transactions throughout the day was the highest of the year, and the price decline was also the smallest record since there was a stock exchange. The January price fell to 1 tael, 6 qian, 7 fen, 7 li and a half in the afternoon. As for the reason for the heavy decline, it is no more than being agitated by the world's trend, and the decline in prices has no national boundaries. The price this month was still stable at the beginning, but Fufeng, in view of the fact that most of the Tianjin flour sales have been captured by the flour, and if the current flour in this city is further increased, I am afraid that there will be no room for the sale of Shen flour in North China, so it was heard in the morning that 30,000 to 40,000 books would be thrown out, and then the building would be taken over in the afternoon. This attitude, in accordance with the world's prices, is really appropriate, because if it is not the case, it will not be possible to stop the influx of foreign flour into China. As for the distant, the quoted price of foreign wheat is still small at three to four jiao, and it can be seen that the foreign wheat market has not yet escaped from the state of oversupply. Australian wheat sales are still endless, so wheat heads are especially panic, or even because of the pursuit of evidence, it must be finished, so the selling atmosphere is very crazy, which has created a tragic decline. After this new minimum record has been seen, according to the world's prices as a ratio, I am afraid that it will still be difficult to enter a peaceful path. As a result, the price this month fell sharply by four fen compared to the previous day, December fell by four and a half fen, January fell by four fen, February fell by three and a half fen, and March and April fell by two fen and seven li and a half, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e228">Wheat Futures Flat and Weak <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market showed a flat decline in each month in the morning and afternoon after the opening. As the quoted price of foreign wheat continued to be small at three to four jiao, in view of the situation in the foreign wheat market, there was little hope of a review, so market sentiment was generally flat and buying was sluggish. However, the number of market in this year's market is actually not much, and there are also few people who are shorting foreign wheat, so the market can still stand firm. If foreign wheat arrives smoothly in the future, no one will care about the wheat market, and the sluggishness of the market is still inevitable, it is said. As a result, this month to January each fell by two fen compared to the previous day, March remained unchanged, and April was slightly less than three fen at the beginning of the idle time. There has been no opening of spot wheat because it has arrived in Shanghai silently, it is said.</p>

<p>｜Hunan Rice Continues to Arrive, Customer Demand Very Active｜</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market was flat, and customers were still inquiring on this street. The market situation was stable. The Fuzhou group welcomed the customer demand for upland rice, but as the source was gradually increasing, the market was stable and did not rise. The Northern group also had a slight transaction. Jiangxi rice has had a very good harvest this year, but because of the problems of donations, taxes, transportation and passports, it has not been able to be transferred to Shanghai. After the 51 bales of machine-made late rice that arrived the day before yesterday had a good price, there may be more arriving gradually in the future. Yesterday, a batch of 125 bales of new machine-made early rice were all handled by the Fuzhou group, and the price was 8 yuan. Because the goods were low-grade and had many broken spots, the price was not fully open, and the high-machine early rice should have a possibility of 8 and a half yuan. 1,064 bales of Hunan machine oil opened at a price of 9 yuan and 2 jiao, and 150 bales of machine Jing rice opened at a price of 9 yuan and 1 jiao, and 100 bales of Jing rice opened at a price of 8 yuan and 4 jiao, of which 100 bales of machine oil rice were handled by the Northern group, and the rest were all handled by the Fuzhou group. Xiao Jiao was handled by this street for 500 bales, at a price of 8 yuan to 7 yuan, 7 jiao and 8 fen, and Chen Xiao Jiao at 7 yuan and 7 jiao, and the market situation was similar to that of the previous market, it is said.</p>

Each term fell by 0.875 to 1.125 points. The December futures created a new low price of 4 jiao, 1 fen, and 875. The transaction on the 2nd totaled 10 million bushels.

<p>Yesterday, the local foreign firm silk market was in a state of slump. Overseas silk telegrams to Shanghai were scarce, and the price was also small. Foreign merchants intended to hoard it cheaply, while Chinese silk merchants insisted. The market was tired and quiet. Yesterday, only Xinfu bought ten bales of white factory silk, and Gao Bei bought twenty bales of Chongmian Yellow silk.</p>

<p>The political strife in Sichuan Province is intense, and the war between the two Lius has already begun. Shipping is difficult, and the supply of Sichuan silk has been cut off. In order to maintain silk sales to Europe and America, silk merchants in the producing areas are now converting factory supplies, etc., into postal packages and delivering them to the post office for delivery. Although Sichuan silk is currently being shipped to Shanghai, the amount is almost zero. In the latter half of last month, only 175 packages were shipped. The source is still difficult to obtain in the future.</p>

<p>Yesterday in the sugar market, although the Dutch exchange rate showed a slight contraction, the bid price was still weak, and sales in all quarters were still sluggish. Therefore, the public association's quotation was flat and lacked energy. The original plate price for two-down, four-grade coarse sand mortar was fourteen taels and nine qian, and there were few buyers. There were more sellers, but there was no intention to sell at a low price, resulting in no transaction. The market prices of eight, nine, and ten grade Dutch red sugars remained unchanged. The domestic white sugar that arrived from the Jianbang company the day before yesterday has not yet been traded because the asking price from the trading house was outrageous. The original plate price of rock candy was slightly different. In the transaction, the Gaozhuang Huizhou white sugar that arrived before Fengbang was once quoted at fifteen and a half taels, but yesterday it was exchanged at fifteen taels, totaling more than 140 packages.

<h3 id="e260">Talking About Skinning <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>丨Three Arts of Dealing with the World丨</p>
<p>The term "skinning" is not found in the classics. In common usage, it roughly means "stingy and unlucky" or "nitpicking." If a person is stingy and unlucky, no matter how prosperous their financial resources may be, they cannot manage a large business. Fan Chou of the Han Dynasty once prepared a feast for the people of the state, but by midday, the food was not available, and more than ten people left on their own. Such people are called skinners. It can be seen that skinners cannot achieve great things.</p>
<p>Counting the big things and not counting the small things cannot be called skinning. Not counting the big things and messing up the small things is skinning. Counting the big things and counting the small things is even more skinning.</p>
<p>Assuming one is frugal with oneself but generous to others, one cannot be considered a skinner. If one is not frugal with oneself but is stingy to others, that is skinning. If one is stingy with oneself and stingy with others, that is even more skinning.</p>
<p>Therefore, skinners are not well-liked. In my hometown, there is an old woman, over seventy years old, with no children. Her assets are no less than three or four hundred thousand gold, yet she still takes on the work of sweeping and cleaning herself, only hiring one maid. People say to her, "Madam, you are so wealthy, why do you make yourself suffer so? Why not be more lenient?" The old woman replied, "You people are lenient, so you have nothing. I am not lenient, so I have this." When the old woman died, her relatives fought over the property, even resorting to lawsuits. It can be seen that skinners are born with a hard life. Even if they have property, it is only for guarding it for others.</p>
<p>Now, when the problem of livelihood is becoming increasingly difficult and the standard of living is rising day by day, it is naturally wrong not to know how to be frugal and to be extravagant and dissolute. Not knowing how to be frugal is different from skinning. Frugality is saving oneself, while skinning is also scraping others. Skinning is also different from stinginess. Stinginess is being petty and unwilling to give to others. Skinning is harming others solely to benefit oneself.</p>
<p>However, although skinning is different from frugality, not being frugal when one should be is skinning. Although skinning is different from stinginess, being stingy when one should not be is also skinning. Therefore, having moderation in eating and drinking, using money with measure, being in what kind of situation, using what kind of display, being in what kind of position, using what kind of economy, exceeding these is mostly skinning.</p>
<p>Therefore, Confucius said, "Acting out of self-interest leads to much resentment."</p>

<h3 id="e262">Common Misconceptions About Biology <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— Xiaoguang</p>
<p>"Not knowing one thing is the shame of a Confucian scholar." In the current era where all kinds of knowledge are divided and specialized, this saying has lost its accuracy. However, common sense about ordinary natural phenomena is something everyone should know. Among natural phenomena, those most closely related to humans are biological phenomena. The general public's views on biology are often seemingly correct but actually wrong. This article aims to point out and explain a few such simple facts, hoping that readers will use this as a starting point for more in-depth and comprehensive research!</p>
<p>(1) Decayed Grass Turns into Fireflies</p>
<p>On summer nights, fireflies twinkle and dance among the flowers and grass, like countless active pearls adorning the night. Sometimes they float to the courtyard, hesitate in the room, looking around, which is quite helpful to the viewing and comforting the loneliness. How do fireflies come about? Not many people know. The "Book of Rites, Monthly Orders" says: "In the third month of summer, decayed grass transforms into fireflies." The "Materia Medica" by Tao Hongjing notes: "Fireflies are transformed from decayed grass and rotten bamboo roots." This is also an error of observation! Fireflies mostly lay eggs on the roots of grass by the water. The eggs are extremely tiny and also emit a faint light. After several metamorphoses, they become flying insects. The ancients saw fireflies appearing on decayed grass and mistakenly believed that the decayed grass had transformed into them!</p>
<p>(2) Earthworms Sing</p>
<p>At dusk, by the banks of rivers and streams, sometimes a clear, faint, and drawn-out sound is heard. The general public believes that this is emitted by earthworms. Therefore, there are folk tales such as "Earthworms sing mountain songs" and "Earthworms play the flute while frogs beat the drum." However, upon close examination of the earthworm's body, there is no sound-producing organ at all. So, who is the originator of this sound? Biologists have already determined that it is the mole cricket. The mole cricket, commonly known as the "soil dog," has a body about an inch long, is brown in color, has two pairs of wings, and strong forelimbs that are good at digging. It is attracted to lights, so it often flies into rooms. It can harm the roots of plants, making it a type of pest. The male insects vibrate their wings to make a sound in the dusk of early summer to attract female insects.</p>
<p>(3) Geckos are Poisonous</p>
<p>Geckos, commonly known as "wall lizards," belong to the lizard family. Their tails are quite brittle and can regenerate when broken off. Each limb has five toes, and the underside of the toes has a wrinkled fold that acts like a suction cup, allowing them to climb freely on walls and smooth glass windows. They feed on insects, making them beneficial animals. It is rumored that their mouths contain potent poison, but this is not true. The poisonous one is another type of scorpion, belonging to the spider family. Their bodies are about three inches long, blue-black in color, and have four pairs of legs on the thorax. The mandibles are developed like crab claws, and the abdomen has segments. The rear end is narrow and long like a tail, with a poisonous hook at the end that can sting people. These animals mostly live in warm and hot regions, are viviparous, and do not undergo metamorphosis. They hide under pebbles, wall corners, tree bark, and dead leaves during the day and come out at night to prey on insects.</p>
<p>(4) Cuckoos Weep Blood</p>
<p>Every spring and early summer, when wheat ripens and mulberries ripen, when fragrant grass is lush and green shade fills the fields, the cuckoos in the deep forests occasionally emit a sad and melancholic cry, seeming to say, "Better to return home!" Repeatedly and lingeringly, it touches people's sorrows! There is a saying that they weep blood:</p>
<p>"The cuckoo cries bitterly and weeps blood incessantly."!! Biya</p>
<p>"Weeping all night until dawn, blood stains the grass and trees."!! Avian Classics</p>
<p>Therefore, men of letters and poets always use the cuckoo to describe sad and sorrowful things, truly beyond enumeration. This misconception of weeping blood actually originates from imprecise observation. Originally, the cuckoo's mouth is bright red. Li Shizhen's "Compendium of Materia Medica" also states: "Shaped like a sparrowhawk but with a dark and gloomy color, with a red mouth." Even when captured cuckoos occasionally have traces of blood on their beaks, it must be due to injury. It is wrong to think that all cuckoos weep blood when they cry!</p>
<p>(5) Dragonflies Lay Eggs and Turn into Fish</p>
<p>"Butterflies fluttering through flowers are deeply seen, dragonflies skimming over water fly gently." — Du Fu</p>
<p>Why do dragonflies skim over water and fly? Because they lay eggs in the water. Small fish appear in the laying area later, and those who do not observe carefully mistakenly believe that these small fish are transformed from the dragonfly's eggs. Little do they know that small fish are transformed from fish eggs, and dragonfly eggs will only turn into dragonflies and will never turn into small fish!</p>
<p>(6) Snakes Have Feet</p>
<p>Everyone knows that "drawing a snake and adding feet" is wrong, but on the other hand, some people say that snakes have feet and that seeing a snake's foot will bring bad luck. This is due to imprecise observation and conjecture. Snakes move entirely by the combined action of their ribs and scales, using the scales on their abdomens to touch the ground obliquely to prevent them from sliding backward, while simultaneously curving their bodies left and right to move forward.</p>

<h3 id="e263">Is Teasing the Newlyweds a Bad Habit? <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>— Wenbing</p>
<p>Humans are emotional and excitable animals, which is at least partially true. Because of this, human life is particularly rich and meaningful. Throughout the year, when festivals arrive, people gather to eat, drink, talk, and laugh, and play with lion lanterns and community theatre. When society and the country have new achievements, people also gather to celebrate. Moreover, as society evolves, the complexities and rituals of human life become even greater. Marriage is a major event in the course of one's life.</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>A significant event, how can we not celebrate it! Teasing the newlyweds! This is originally a good thing to start the life of two genders, and it is also a wonderful way to enhance the feelings of family members. Not only is there no need to criticize it, but it is also necessary to promote it. Therefore, after reading Mr. Xiaoxue's "Abolish the Bad Habit of Teasing the Newlyweds," I feel that there is a need to make some clarifications.</p>
<p>Xiaojun said: "Teasing the newlyweds is to increase the feelings of the bride and groom, which is why there is such a move. We know that previous marriages were like a sale, ... so they came up with the wonderful method of teasing the newlyweds to enhance their feelings." I think the point of enhancing feelings is correct, but its origin is not the old-fashioned marriage of buying and selling. It also said: "...If the little couple is in pain that everyone's appearance is not suitable, and their tempers are not bitter, then you don't need to tease them, and they will be fine. On the contrary, it will only get worse and worse." This makes me dare not agree. I think the old-fashioned marriage with bitter appearances and tempers should of course be teased to further enhance their love. On the contrary, we should think of ingenious ways to make up and make peace, so as to make up for the sins of the old marriage. Don't we often see couples who are not harmonious, and the parents go to ask fortune tellers or go to the temple to get some "harmony water" for them to drink? That is unreasonable and should be abolished! Xiaojun also said: "Gradually, teasing the newlyweds has become a necessary move at weddings, a good opportunity for revenge... Social bad habits like this, what can be done!" As I said before, teasing the newlyweds has become a necessary move at weddings, which is a manifestation of the evolution of the times. There is no need to doubt and curse it. As for saying that it is a good opportunity for revenge, it is unavoidable to make dangerous words. I dare not admit that it is a social bad habit! The examples of A, B, and C cited by Xiaojun may be fictitious. I have never heard of such facts. It also said: "... Taking advantage of the wine, do as many unconscious actions as possible. Therefore, conflicts often occur between the groom and the guests, and lawsuits often occur... Why bother!" This may happen occasionally, but how can we fundamentally deny the existence of an event because of an occasional deviation? As for saying that lawsuits are caused by teasing the newlyweds, I have never heard of it. "Modern weddings, wooden marriages replace 'kissing' with 'Kiss' are extremely corrupt, ... the feelings are already very harmonious, why bother with this move?" I only think that changing "kissing" to "Kiss" is enslavement, and cannot be called corruption, and I also think that those who have feelings need to be more harmonious, so that men and women can obtain unlimited happiness between husband and wife. "Shanghai is a place of exchange of new trends, ... but it has not washed away these bad habits. I don't know how to explain it?" This is a question at the end of Xiaojun. It is precisely because Shanghai is more evolved than the mainland that this custom is more prosperous. It's just that there are some changes in the way of "teasing"! Improvement, changing playing the erhu to picking up Huai'e Lin, etc. Moreover, I think that in the future Shanghai, and even the entire society, there will be new patterns of teasing the newlyweds.</p>

<h3 id="e264">On Xiafei Road <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>— Yiping</p>
<p>One year I was seriously ill and followed the doctor's advice to live on Xiafei Road for a long time. This place is humorous and quiet, with small trees on both sides and a flat avenue. If you lean on the window sill and look out idly, a car speeding from over there looks like it's rushing to heaven. I often lost my mind like this. In the shadow of the setting sun, young men and women holding hands embellish the scene with a lot of exotic scenery. But the city is a great collection of sins. This virgin-like Xiafei Road now presents a different kind of brilliance. Don't believe me? Let me tell you a story:</p>
<p>One Sunday, I was dragged to the French Park by a friend, passing by Xiafei Road. Next to a certain tram station, there stood a beautiful girl. Our eyes were naturally stunned by her. Just then, two trams drove up one after another, but she didn't get on. My friend said, "Mysterious street! You've already moved here." Sure enough, she saw us standing for too long and occasionally squinted and smiled, and then lowered her head shyly, which can be said to "exert the ability to seduce." I grabbed my friend's hand and started walking. After crossing a short crosswalk, I turned back to look at the place where she was standing, and a blue-eyed wanderer was holding her hand and walking towards us. Seeing us turn back to look at her, he showed a smug smile, as if saying: "Low-energy people!"</p>
<p>In China, where production is lagging behind, many self-proclaimed people are raising their heads and waiting to be fed. Although some people are shouting about women's occupations, they are nothing more than "red flower vases." This beautiful girl has fallen to this point, and we also bear a part of the responsibility! Is it just a stain on Xiafei Road?</p>
<p>Friends! Recognize your responsibilities and enjoy this humorous Xiafei Road:</p>

<p>"Hello! Mr. Shang! Are you going to the Penglai to see a Peking opera?" A classmate stood downstairs and asked loudly.</p>
<p>"No, I have to prepare for my classes. We have physics and history exams next Monday, but I haven't turned a single page of my books yet, Lao Li. To be honest, I'll have to accompany you another day!" The classmate surnamed Shang leaned out of the window and replied directly and cheerfully.</p>
<p>"Bah! I'm really used to hearing these lies. People specially came to ask you to go with them because they think highly of you, but I didn't expect you to say such lies. It's really..." The classmate said to this temple, filled with anger and rushed straight into their dormitory.</p>
<p>It is said that the classmate surnamed Shang had already heard the sound of this classmate running up the stairs, so he hurriedly hid the letter he was writing in the drawer. But no matter what, there is no such fast skill. As a result, because a pen could not be put into the pen holder in time, the classmate noticed that he was indeed writing a letter and not reading a book. So he couldn't help but clap his hands and laugh, saying: "Oh! I see, what you call studying hard is specifically referring to practicing writing ××, haha! Tomorrow I will go to the school to advertise you."</p>
<p>In this way, the classmate surnamed Shang was so embarrassed that he turned red and could not say half a word. Finally, their agreement was as follows: Shang was allowed to go to the theater with him, and the other classmate's advertising was also cancelled. It is said that the classmate surnamed Shang was still carrying a book of Western history in his hand when he went out, preparing to review it in the theater.</p>

<h3 id="e266">Now We Must Enter Creation Through Imitation (5) <a href="#e266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Dabeih</p>
<p>Hoping that Chinese films can occupy a place in the global film industry competition, and that Chinese people can showcase our unique strengths in the performing arts, our most crucial first step is to completely separate the past from the future, dividing them into two distinct periods.</p>
<p>The past decade or more has been a period of imitation in our film and drama history. From today onwards, the future will be our period of originality.</p>
<p>In America, many "Oriental obsessed" critics compliment us as the originators of shadow plays. Consequently, a group of boastful overseas Chinese become complacent and proud. Indeed, "Luanzhou Shadow Plays" and similar forms of entertainment are still prevalent in our northern provinces and were invented before various European and American shadow plays. However, would we dare to hold up these colorful human and animal carvings made of animal hide and boast to people around the world who are fascinated by the art of film that the Chinese nation is the original inventor of shadow plays? Complimenting us as the originators of shadow plays is merely a gesture of politeness, but we cannot take undue credit and insist that this art form of the silver screen, which will eventually replace blackboards, is a distant relative of our "Luanzhou Shadow Plays." When we examine the history of film development, we see the arduous and courageous contributions of researchers in America and other Western countries to this art form, and we cannot help but feel ashamed of ourselves. Why is it that the Chinese people, who were able to invent "Leather Puppet Shadow Plays," have only stagnated and remained unchanged for centuries? Why did we not evolve "Leather Puppet Shadow Plays" into modern films ourselves? We should be ashamed, not boastful!</p>
<p>What "Oriental Jack Coogan," what "Chinese Lillian Gish," what "Chinese Charlie Chaplin"—titles like these were commonly seen in advertisements, promotional reviews, or news reports. We didn't feel any shame in them because we considered ourselves to be in an enlightenment period. Imitation is inevitable during the enlightenment period. Therefore, we can frankly say that the Chinese film industry before today has been entirely in a period of imitation.</p>

<p>— Zhisheng</p>
<p>After foreign films are imported and Chinese films are produced, they must first be sent to the Film Censorship Committee, jointly formed by the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Education, for review. Only after the committee approves and issues a performance license can they be publicly shown in cinemas across the country. The committee has been established for nearly two years, and both Chinese and foreign film merchants have been able to abide by the regulations and apply for censorship. Recently, due to the Paramount Pictures production, "Shanghai Express," which has been shown in various European countries and contains content that insults the Chinese people, a protest was lodged with Paramount Pictures, demanding that the film be voluntarily withdrawn and destroyed within two months. According to reports from the embassy stationed here, the film is still being shown in European cities. After a meeting on November 1st, the committee decided to notify Paramount Pictures in Shanghai and request a response, as the two-month deadline has passed. If a satisfactory response is not received, the committee will suspend the censorship of its films and request the embassy in Belgium to report whether the film is still being shown in Europe.</p>

<p>The weather is getting colder, and actors with modest incomes are all thinking about getting winter clothes. However, with limited income, making a new set of clothes would require at least two months of unpaid work. Therefore, Lianhua actors like Jin Yan are advocating buying second-hand clothes to reduce the pressure on their lives. Once this trend started, many employees followed suit, unexpectedly adding a lot of business to the Western suit shops on Wusong Road. So yesterday afternoon, when Lianhua wasn't filming, they gathered four or five colleagues, called a Yunfei car, and went to Wusong Road in a large group to buy cheap goods.</p>

<p>Director Gregory Lacava is a very experienced person. He says: The vanity of men never seeks truth and is actually twice as great as that of women. He proved this during filming because male actors spend more than twice as much time as female actors using the mirror for touch-ups before going on camera.</p>

If she is violent or dissolute in front of someone, it means she likes them. She never uses furry decorations. Many of her friends call her "Taro," but she doesn't care about people's criticism and opinions. Because she is eccentric, she is noticed as much as a big star, even though she is not one.</p>

<p>Review of "The Young Bride" - Yannan "The Young Bride" is Helen Twelvetrees's latest masterpiece. She is the only mainstay of Pathé Pictures. In this film, she fully developed her art, making the audience follow her joys and sorrows, which is indeed not an easy task, especially in the second half. Her moving expressions are aesthetically pleasing everywhere. The male lead, Eric Linden, is also an excellent assistant to her, fully and naturally revealing the weaknesses of an immature young man. The rest of the cast are at least competent.</p>
<p>The director is also admirable! The fact that the film is presented so magically is naturally due to the director's achievement. For example, in "The Young Bride," when the couple parted ways, the lights suddenly dimmed, causing the audience's emotions to tighten. There are many more, but I can't describe them all at once! The light is soft and moderate, and the scenery is also well arranged, especially the distant night view of the dance floor.</p>

<p>This is Joan Blondell, known for her beautiful eyes. She will soon meet you in the Cathay film "Three Sisters."</p>
<p>Not long ago, Joan was a clerk in a novel circulation society, earning only eighteen dollars a week. However, one day, she had a misunderstanding with a reader, who said to her, "Think about it yourself." Joan thought for a long time and quit her job as a clerk, running to Hollywood. Now her salary is one thousand dollars a week, which is not much, but it is much better than eighteen dollars.</p>
<p>The passage in the book, "There is jade-like beauty in books," seems a bit too fake, but this film is a masterpiece no matter what.</p>

<p>Douglas Fairbanks has a long and glorious history on the screen. Since the popularity of sound films, he has only made one film a year, dedicating all his efforts to this film. The rest of the time, he simply travels leisurely, enjoying the scenery and his middle age.</p>
<p>In 1932, there was "Around the World in Eighty Minutes," which was recently screened at the Cathay Theater. The newspapers have already reviewed it well. It is likely that it will be re-screened at the Rong Guang Theater soon.</p>
<p>Douglas Fairbanks's work in 1931 was "Reaching for the Moon," which was also one of United Artists' major films of 1931. It was not only the first collaboration between Bebe Daniels and Douglas Fairbanks but also Bebe Daniels's first joining United Artists. Many people have probably seen it and can still remember how she performed! It can probably be said that this film is worth watching again.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Grand Theatre is reopening today after the war, and selecting this film is indeed a way to satisfy the long-tired appetites of movie fans in Hongkou. In addition, the Rong Guang Theater recently opened, which may be a sign of the revival of Hongkou.</p>

<h3 id="e276">On the Trends of Soviet Films in the Last Fifteen Years (Continued) <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Yi</p>
<p>丨Based on the opinions of Harry An Potamkin丨</p>
<p>Because there is no difference in the selection of materials for films now compared to the past, in today's Soviet drama, there are works like "Road to Life" (this film was once shown at Ping An Theater in Tianjin, translated as "Minsheng Road," but it was said that some parts were cut), and in the past, there were also works like "Children of the Desert." Similarly, today there is "Siberian Sentinels," and in the past, there were "Red Pathisans" and "Red Gas," two works that are similar in terms of material selection. These works all depict the self-armament of workers, peasants, and soldiers to drive out all invaders who touch the Soviet Union. During this period, all films, although there are no changes in the selection of materials compared to the past, have completely abandoned the immature state of the past. This difference is significant. In the past films, all we saw were just acting actors, but now they have been replaced by the characteristics of real life. In the past, Eisenstein and Pudovkin were merely rhetoricians of "great" films, but now they have indeed intimately contacted "greatness." The syllogistic style that leads from petty bourgeois individualism (the expansion of actors) to an inhuman film performance has been declared a dead relic. In its place, what we see is the flowering of collectivism and the activity of human character in "Road to Life" and "Golden Mountain." (To be continued)</p>
