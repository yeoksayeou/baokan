<h3 id="c1">政治黑暗與敎育破產彬 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>昨評發表後。記者復廻環沉思。深感以學風替下。敎育破產。獨責敎育界。未免失之太偏。且或亦非敎育界人士所願聞。蓋敎育之破產。其最大根因。則仍由於政治之黑暗也。</p>
<p>十六年國民黨誓師北伐。全國學生。多奮起響應。其於革命盡力至多。而黨所致力之靑年運動。則更以喚起靑年努力從事革命爲口號。故經歷民十六十七革命高潮而後。一般學生對於「讀書問題。」已深感政治而不上軌道。社會而長此停滯。「讀書」實毫無所爲有重新估量其價値之必要。而寖以傾向政治减低其讀書之興趣。迨國民黨旣底定全國。對於靑年之自由思想。即開始施以裁制。敎育黨化。訓練亦以黨之意志爲轉移。黨之所是者。必皆是之。黨之所非者。亦必皆非之。彼生機甫萌之靑年。乃忽遭受無情之桎梏。一綫之光明。忽又重返於黑暗。於是而强者不恤走險。弱者則悲觀銷沉。流入奢靡驕縱之途。以自戕其生命之力。此所以致今日之惡果者一也。</p>
<p>不僅此也。自國民黨藉民衆之力以取得政權。復藉政治之力量以壓抑民衆勢力之伸張。於是而軍閥政治與官僚政治乃重新抬頭。割據勢成。内戰時作。官僚當政。貪汚專橫。但知利己。不恤人民。於是而政成黑暗。而軍閥則又但知養兵。以增强其爭雄長之實力。政客但知中飽。以富裕其快慾念之私囊。國家財政。旣已費去百分之八十以養兵。而政費則又再經官僚之中飽。敎育旣不爲彼輩所措意。更敎費更可恣意拖欠。邇年以來。各國立學校以經費之無着。已顏於一致關門之狀態。從事敎育者生計之艱苦。更匪言所能宣。呼籲請求。全國一致。而敎育經費之長年欠發也如故。從事敎育者亦以生活艱難。不能安心於其所事。而軍閥政客又常藉口「反動。」橫肆摧殘。此的以致今日之惡果者二也。</p>
<p>邇年以來。敎育界已爲官僚政治所侵入。敎育行政。旣無固定計劃。敎職則更視安揷私人之位置。敎育界中。派别分歧。壁壘森儼。門户各别。競奪位置。怪象百出。多數學校之風潮。大都有不肖黨人與政客爲其主動。所謂黨化敎育。恰爲黨人操縱敎。育於是而賢者灰心。不肖之輩乃更得以恣意。此致今日之惡果者二也。</p>
<p>吾人從可知政治而不淸明。凡百皆無整飭之望。而今日學風之敗壞。與敎育之破壞。固不能獨以此重責敎育界。凡此惡果。皆以黑暗政治種其惡因。</p>
<p>雖然。敎育界仍不能遂謂爲無責也。敎育之目的。在於改變現實。推進社會。在於敎導靑年與現實奮鬥。劍造未來之新天地。是則處於今日黑暗政治之下。敎育界人士爲自救計爲救靑年計爲救敎育計。急應起而與政治上之惡勢力奮鬥。與社會惡環境奮鬥。以敎育改造政治與社會培。養民族未來健全之萌芽。此乃眞爲敎育界人士當前應負之重責。記者謹以無限之熱忱。祝望眞能愛護敎育。眞肯致力敎育事業諸君切實負起。</p>

<p>— 佛</p>
<p>馮玉祥雖非我心目中最崇拜而最尊敬之人物，但至少亦可説是一個至奇異而足塲注意之人物</p>
<p>馮玉祥於二十三日乘專車赴泰山養疴，縣長周百鍠向馮氏報稱已在斗母宫預備住所，種種應用物品，亦已設備，馮即詢以所用之錢，係汝私欵，抑係老百姓錢，汝以何權取以購買物品，爲我預備公館，我到此養疴，一草一木不准動用百姓的，周百鍠慚然而退，因此馮不住斗母宫，臨時改住普照寺，</p>
<p>這一叚小小的趣事，値得我們百二十分的贊同，試問在今日國府要人中，那一個不是予取予求的？那一個不願受人家供應的？那一個不要用老百姓一草一木的？這種刻苦自持的人物，求諸今日政府要人之中，除馮氏外實罕見其人或者説馮氏這種態度，完全欺人，完全是矯揉造作，我也承認馮氏是矯揉造作，因爲人類是性惡的，孟軻亦説是食色性也，倘馮氏的矯揉造作，果能表裏如一，始終如一，我就認爲他的好處，認爲他是勝過别人，倘現在國府要人都肯像馮之矯揉造作，不受人家供應，不用老百姓一草一木，我想政府决不致於弄到這樣地步，社會也决不致於弄到這樣地步，</p>
<p>不過我還有一個欵問，此次馮到泰山養疴，聞有隨員醫生及衛隊等百餘人，不知這種人的供應，是那裏來的，是馮氏拿出私錢供給的呢？還是百餘隨員衛隊各人自給的？若云馮氏完全拿個人的私錢出來供給，那末，我又要問馮氏　錢是遺產的呢？還是做官而得來的</p>
<p>馮氏處處表示平民化，不欲以偉大人物自居，不欲以中央委員身分自居，但是以一平民養病，而身帶隨員衛隊人等百餘人，這樣的平民，殊爲罕見，至少也可稱他是一個特别的平民了，</p>
<p>馮氏刻苦自勵，廉潔自矢，我深爲欽佩，以上云云，亦是春秋責備賢者之意，並非要馮氏亦學其他要人之驕奢淫逸，縱慾敗度，方爲滿意，惟深望馮氏的平民化，倘再能澈底一些，再能完滿一些則更爲贊同，</p>

<p>笑氣的化學名稱是亞養化氮（Ｎｉｔｒｏｕｓｏｘｉｄｅ），牠的化學式是Ｎ２Ｏ，因爲人吸了這種氣體神經便受了麻醉，不自主地大笑，所以呌牠做笑氣，笑氣是在一七七二年普利斯特利（Ｐｒｉｅｓｔｌｅｙ）所發見的：他用還原的方法，把養化氮（Ｎｉｔｒｉｃｏｘｉｄ）變爲弄養化氮（用濕鐵屑做養化劑），但是我們有一個較爲利便的製造法：</p>

<h3 id="e1">Political Darkness and Educational Bankruptcy <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>After yesterday's commentary was published, the reporter once again pondered deeply. I deeply feel that attributing the decline in academic ethos and the bankruptcy of education solely to the education sector is somewhat too one-sided. Moreover, it may not be what people in the education sector want to hear. The greatest root cause of the bankruptcy of education still lies in the darkness of politics.</p>
<p>In the sixteenth year, when the Kuomintang vowed to launch the Northern Expedition, students across the country rose up in response. They devoted themselves to the revolution to the greatest extent. The youth movement the Party was committed to even took awakening the youth to strive for revolution as its slogan. Therefore, after experiencing the revolutionary climax of the sixteenth and seventeenth years of the Republic, the general student body deeply felt that with politics not on the right track and society stagnating for a long time, "studying" was actually useless and it was necessary to re-evaluate its value. They gradually tended toward politics and reduced their interest in studying. When the Kuomintang had stabilized the entire country, it began to impose restrictions on the free thinking of young people. Education was party-ized, and training was also shifted according to the will of the Party. What the Party affirmed, must be affirmed. What the Party denied, must be denied. The young people, whose vitality was just sprouting, suddenly suffered ruthless shackles. A glimmer of light suddenly returned to darkness. Thus, the strong risked danger, while the weak became pessimistic and depressed, drifting into extravagance and indulgence, using their life force to destroy themselves. This is one of the reasons for today's evil consequences.</p>
<p>Moreover, since the Kuomintang seized power by relying on the strength of the masses, it used political power to suppress the expansion of mass forces. Thus, warlord politics and bureaucratic politics re-emerged. Separatism formed, and civil wars occurred from time to time. Bureaucrats in power were corrupt and tyrannical. They only knew self-interest and did not care about the people. Thus, politics became dark. The warlords only knew how to raise troops to increase their strength in the struggle for hegemony. Politicians only knew how to enrich themselves in order to satisfy their desires. Eighty percent of the national finances were spent on raising troops, and government expenses were further embezzled by bureaucrats. Education was not valued by these people, and education funds could be arbitrarily delayed. In recent years, national schools at all levels have faced the state of unanimous closure due to a lack of funding. The hardship of the livelihoods of those engaged in education is beyond description. Appeals and requests were made unanimously across the country, but the perennial arrears of education funds remained the same. Those engaged in education were unable to concentrate on their work due to difficult living conditions. Warlords and politicians often used the excuse of "reactionaryism" to wantonly destroy things. This is the second reason for today's evil consequences.</p>
<p>In recent years, the education sector has been invaded by bureaucratic politics. Educational administration has no fixed plans, and teaching positions are regarded as a place to place personal cronies. Within the education sector, factions are divided, and barriers are strict. Each faction has its own territory, competing for positions, and strange phenomena abound. The majority of school unrests are mostly initiated by unscrupulous Party members and politicians. The so-called party-ized education is exactly the Party manipulating education. Thus, the virtuous become discouraged, and the unscrupulous are able to act arbitrarily. This is the third reason for today's evil consequences.</p>
<p>We can see from this that if politics is not clear, there is no hope for rectification in anything. The failure of today's academic ethos and the destruction of education cannot solely blame the education sector. All these evil consequences are due to the dark politics planting evil seeds.</p>
<p>However, the education sector cannot be said to be without responsibility. The purpose of education is to change reality, promote society, and teach young people to fight against reality and create a new world of the future. Therefore, under today's dark politics, education sector personnel should urgently rise up and fight against the evil forces in politics and against the evil social environment in order to save themselves, save the youth, and save education. Use education to transform politics and society, and cultivate the healthy seeds of the nation's future. This is truly the important responsibility that education sector personnel should bear at present. The reporter sincerely wishes that all those who truly love education and are truly willing to devote themselves to the education cause will earnestly take on this responsibility.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Ceasefire Conference Resumes with Subcommittee Meeting <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Considerable progress was reportedly made in discussing detailed measures and locations for the Japanese troop withdrawal. The general assembly will reconvene simultaneously at 10:00 AM today. The issue of a deadline will be the focus of today's meeting. The ceasefire conference and general assembly adjourned yesterday, but the military subcommittee held two meetings at the British Consulate, discussing detailed measures for the Japanese troop withdrawal. The meeting's press release stated that considerable progress had been made, but there was still one point where the opinions of the Chinese and Japanese sides were not consistent. Discussions will continue at 10:00 AM this morning. The ceasefire conference is scheduled to reconvene at 10:00 AM this morning, and the issue of a deadline will be the focus of today's meeting.</p>
<p>Developments Yesterday. The formal ceasefire conference has been in session for a week since it began last Thursday, with eight general assemblies held. Although various minor issues have been gradually resolved, the two key points of location and deadline in the Japanese troop withdrawal procedure have not been satisfactorily resolved. Therefore, the ceasefire situation has been wavering and tortuous within the conference, with no significant progress. Outside the conference, rumors are rife, making it even more difficult to discern the truth. The general assembly adjourned yesterday to allow the military subcommittee to discuss the remaining unresolved points. The military subcommittee met at the British Consulate at 10:00 AM yesterday morning and adjourned at 1:00 PM. Discussions resumed at 3:00 PM and adjourned at 6:15 PM. The attendees included Huang Qiang, Chief of Staff of the 19th Route Army, and secretaries Guo Dehua and Yin Rugeng representing the Chinese side, and Army Staff Officer Waniichiro Tashiro, and secretaries Kita, Abe, and Kajiwara representing the Japanese side. Representatives from relevant countries included British Embassy Military Attaché Sandhill, US Embassy Military Attaché Trestaille, French Embassy Military Attaché Pennavitae, and Italian Embassy Military Attaché Faratini. The meeting lasted for six hours, focusing on discussing the "Bilian section" of the Public Concession where Japanese troops would temporarily withdraw. The subcommittee had discussed one key point on Monday and adjourned on Tuesday to seek instructions from the chief representatives of both sides. Yesterday's subcommittee meeting proceeded with concrete discussions based on the results of the instructions. This newspaper reporter learned last night that the "Bilian section" of the Concession discussed by the subcommittee yesterday had moved from a vague area to actual locations. The Japanese side requested four locations for the temporary withdrawal: the area from the Japanese cemetery to the Sixty-Three Garden area in Zhabei, the area around the International Sports Field in Jiangwan, the area from Yangshupu East to the Far Eastern Sports Field in Yinxiang, and the area from Wusong Town to the Yunzaobang Zhanghuabang area in Wusong. The four locations are separate and not connected. The distance from a certain section to a certain section and the number of troops stationed were specified in detail according to the map. Yesterday's meeting clarified the details, which took a long time. However, it was heard that the Chinese side had not yet agreed and will continue discussions this morning. The Japanese side also requested that Japanese troops be stationed in the Tanzibang and Youjiaojiao areas where the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways connect. The Chinese side rejected this request because it could control the traffic on both lines. As for the Shanghai-Wusong Road, Japanese troops are not allowed to be stationed along the line to facilitate traffic.</p>
<h3 id="e3">This Morning's Meeting <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>The deadline for the Japanese army to withdraw from the Bilian section of the concession was not discussed at yesterday's subcommittee meeting and will be discussed at today's general assembly. The point of the Japanese complete withdrawal deadline is the one most insisted upon by the Chinese side. Therefore, there should be a dispute at today's general assembly. At that time, the military subcommittees will also continue to hold separate meetings.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Conference Announcement <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>The military subcommittee announced yesterday afternoon that the military subcommittee continued to discuss the issue of troop withdrawal, put forward various suggestions, and conducted detailed discussions. The afternoon meeting will continue at 3:00 PM. Last night, it was announced that the military subcommittee continued discussions in the afternoon and made considerable progress. The unresolved issues will be discussed this morning.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Off-site Contact <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>The general assembly adjourned yesterday. However, Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu Aoi and Inukai Tsuyoshi's representative Matsuoka went to the British Consulate at 9:45 AM yesterday morning to make off-site contacts with British Minister Lampson, US Minister Johnson, and Italian Chargé d'Affaires Ciano. They left at 10:30 AM. Vice Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi also went to the British Consulate at 6:00 PM yesterday afternoon for contact, for about an hour.</p>
<h3 id="e6">French Ambassador Representative <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>French Minister Wilden was unable to attend the meeting in person due to illness. He previously sent Embassy Secretary Bode to attend as a representative. Now, due to the importance of the meeting, he specifically telegraphed Legrand, First Counselor of the French Embassy in China, from Peiping to Shanghai to attend the meeting. Since arriving in Shanghai, Mr. Legrand has been attending as a representative of the French Minister since the day before yesterday, and took a car to Vice Minister Guo Taiqi's residence at No. 2 Laurière Road yesterday morning, where they had a long talk.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Other Conference Reports <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reported that the meeting continued at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. The attendees from both sides were the same as in the morning, and the counselors from various countries also attended. After the meeting, the location of the troop withdrawal was discussed. The Japanese representative still put forward several locations based on the morning's position, including near Wusong Town Jiangwan, Yunzaobang South, Yinxiang Port, and Zhabei, as the locations for the Japanese army to be stationed. The Chinese side firmly disagreed. The Japanese representative still said that the concession had been made to this point and could not be conceded any further. If so, there would be a split. The Chinese representative also responded that according to the principle, the Japanese army should not be stationed in any area other than the concession. He asked whether the area currently proposed by the Japanese side was within the principle. The Japanese representative was quite displeased. Later, the counselors from various countries mediated with all their efforts, buffering left and right, and decided to hold a separate meeting at 10:00 AM this morning at the same time as the formal meeting.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Tashiro's Remarks <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Japanese representative Waniichiro Tashiro made a statement to a reporter yesterday, saying that the Chinese side's attitude was tough at the morning meeting, and the future was difficult to be optimistic about. The afternoon meeting made some progress, but the important points still did not have results.</p>
<h3 id="e9">Fierce Fighting in Taicang Yesterday <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Gunfire was heard in other areas. The frontline Japanese army is actively preparing for war. Suzhou, 30th Dispatch: At Dabai Bridge in Xijing, the enemy attacked our defense line on the morning of the 30th. The artillery fire was fierce. The artillery fire stopped in the afternoon, but the machine guns did not stop until night. Five enemy warships and more than twenty civilian ships arrived at Qiukou on the 30th, and there were signs of landing. A fierce battle broke out in Donghongmiao, Taicang on the morning of the 30th.</p>
<p>Changshu, 30th Dispatch: Five more enemy warships and more than twenty civilian ships arrived at Qiukou, preparing to land. There was contact in Pailou City on the 28th, and the artillery fire did not stop on the morning of the 30th. The enemy advanced westward at the Dabeidian south of Yuewang City. Many people fled from Zhouji Bridge, and the battle at Hongmiao was fierce. The enemy increased the number of troops in Luodian by more than 10,000.</p>
<p>Kunshan, 30th Dispatch: Since the 23rd, the enemy has continuously increased its troops in Lijialou, east of Huangdu Station, to more than 10,000. Trenches have been dug in various villages. The command headquarters is located in Beiwang Village. The enemy troops in Jiading City have now withdrawn to Luodian and Yuxianggong Temple, and are building defensive works in the Malu Town area. The enemy's 9th Division, originally stationed in Liuhe Jiading, has been transferred, and replaced by the 10th and 16th regiments. On the 27th, the enemy set fire to Zhujia Bridge, destroying dozens of civilian houses. The enemy built defensive trenches in Liuting, Jiading, and dozens of Jiangbei people were stationed in the Chanxin Temple there. Our division captured four Han traitors at Qianmentang yesterday, and seized a rifle, a box gun, four boxes of ammunition, a horse, and two bicycles. Yesterday, six enemy soldiers in plain clothes were found hiding in the trenches abandoned by us west of Yangqiao Station at Tianfu'an, searching pedestrians. They were subsequently repelled by our sentries.</p>
<p>The 19th Route Army's office in Shanghai received a telegram from the front on the 29th stating that: (1) At 11:00 AM today, a plainclothes team of fifty or sixty people, carrying machine guns, advanced towards Xinmu Bridge, east of Taicang. At the same time, more than thirty enemy troops also arrived at Hengli Bridge and retreated after being attacked by our army. (2) More than three hundred enemy regular troops also arrived at Zhujiazhai, Bilian, Xinmu Bridge, Taicang, and shot at our sentries. From this, it can be seen that while the Japanese side is participating in the ceasefire conference, it is still continuing its military actions, and it is clear that it has no sincerity in the ceasefire. In addition to lodging a serious protest, our side should pay attention to its military actions, otherwise, it is feared that it will fall into its trap.</p>
<p>Someone came from Luopu Town in Wusong and said that the Japanese soldiers were digging trenches very busily in the Sitanqiao area. Gunfire was heard in Taicangjiao, and four or five damaged cars were seen carrying Japanese wounded soldiers, and occasionally wounded horses. The Japanese headquarters from Wusong to Jiading has now moved to Luodian.</p>
<p>Yesterday, three trucks of dead Japanese soldiers were transported from the front to the Huishan Wharf, with about a hundred corpses loaded into transport ships and sailed back to Japan.</p>
<h3 id="e10">British Press Comments on the Shanghai Incident <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Japan Fears Losing Prestige and Delays Decision. Britain Accepts Japanese Views Impression. Reuters, 30th, London: The Manchester Guardian reported that Japan clearly does not want to give up its position in Shanghai unless it fulfills its previously proposed requirements, especially the prohibition of commercial boycotts. The Shanghai Incident, except for the cessation of hostilities, remains the same. Japan's willingness to withdraw troops from Shanghai is as welcome as China and the powers want them to leave. The reason why the case has been delayed is only that Japan fears losing its prestige. Japan claims that the Shanghai Incident and the Manchurian Incident should be separated. Its intention is that Japan can do whatever it wants in Manchuria, while acknowledging that the Shanghai Incident is related to other countries besides China and Japan. Unfortunately, the British government has given the impression that Britain can accept the Japanese views on this matter. However, the power of the United States, or the power of the majority of members of the League of Nations, seems to be applied in the opposite direction to Britain.</p>
<h3 id="e11">Japanese Army Battalion Commander Major Kuga Commits Suicide <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Shot Himself in the Location Where He Was Captured. The Great American Evening News reported that Major Kuga, Commander of the Second Battalion of the 7th Regiment of the 9th Division of the Japanese Army, was captured by the Chinese army in the Jiangwan battlefield and taken to Nanjing. He was detained for ten days. About two weeks after his release, according to Japanese sources, he shot himself in the location where he was captured, Yanjiazhai, west of Jiangwan, on Monday afternoon. It is reported that Kuga was subordinate to Major General Ueda's command. On February 20, he led his troops to the front line in Jiangwan for combat. He was surrounded by the Chinese army. The Japanese army fought hard for two days and could not eat. Kuga was injured in the chest and arms by a hand grenade and was captured and taken to Nanjing. On March 16, Kuga and several other prisoners were released by the Chinese authorities and sent to Shanghai. Kuga was subsequently interrogated by a Japanese military court and released on Monday. Unexpectedly, that afternoon, he went to the location where he was captured, took out a pistol, pointed it at his mouth, and fired. He was seriously injured and died soon after. Before his death, Kuga wrote a suicide note stating that the soldiers under his command fought extremely bravely. It is now heard that the Japanese authorities mourn Kuga's suicide and have asked Japanese residents and people in this city to raise funds to support his bereaved family.</p>
<p>Three Groups</p>
<h3 id="e12">Yesterday's Visit to Representative Guo <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Questioned the Weak Diplomacy and Proposed Four Suggestions. Shanghai University Students' Anti-Japanese National Salvation Federation, China Youth National Salvation Association, China Student National Salvation Association, and other three groups, because the Japanese army has no sincerity in withdrawing troops, and our diplomatic authorities have a weak attitude, specially sent representatives Zheng Jie, Shen Zurong, Yan Jinyu, Zhi Sheng, Jiang Hao, Li Qiao, Chen Tang, etc. to visit Representative Guo yesterday morning, and stated diplomatic opinions and raised several questions. (1) Why did our diplomatic authorities start negotiations before the violent Japanese army withdrew the army, navy, and air force in China? Guo replied that the scope of this ceasefire conference is limited to the issue of troop withdrawal and does not involve political issues. (2) Why is the Sino-Japanese issue being resolved partially? Guo replied that the Northeast issue has not been relaxed, but he is solely responsible for the Shanghai incident troop withdrawal negotiation. (3) The ceasefire agreement stipulates that only the Chinese police are allowed to maintain law and order in the area where the Japanese army withdraws. Why are Chinese troops not allowed to be stationed in Chinese territory? Guo replied that this measure is temporarily taken to avoid conflict. (4) Is allowing only the Chinese police to maintain law and order a political issue? Guo replied that this is a political issue, but it has to be accommodated due to the factual relationship. (5) Does our government have an overall diplomatic policy towards Japan? Guo replied that this is the responsibility of the government, but the government's past measures cannot satisfy the people. This account cannot be calculated to him. (6) According to Mr. Guo, under the pressure of force, there are only two ways to solve the problem: force or diplomacy. May I ask whether the government's current adoption of diplomatic methods contradicts the government's previously announced long-term resistance policy? Guo replied that this is the responsibility of the government. Finally, the representatives seriously expressed four points: (1) Resolutely advocate the unconditional withdrawal of the violent Japanese army, navy, and air force in China. Oppose any negotiations and selling of national interests before the withdrawal. (2) Resolutely oppose the partial solution of the Sino-Japanese issue. (3) The only way out for the Japanese issue is military resistance. (4) The diplomatic policy must not violate public opinion. Representative Guo sincerely expressed that he would try his best to adopt it. If the government changes, he will only resign to thank the people of the country and will never sign a treaty that humiliates the country and forfeits its sovereignty.</p>
<p>The Resumption of Business Committee Resolved to Open the Market with Pain</p>
<h3 id="e13">Declaration Released Yesterday <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Visit Mr. Fei Xindun to Suggest Protection Measures</p>
<p>Telegram to the National Government Military Council Rejecting the Signing of a Treaty that Humiliates the Country</p>
<p>The Resumption of Business Committee, jointly organized by the Citizens' Federation and other groups, held a second committee meeting yesterday and resolved to release a declaration to open the market with pain. Representatives were also sent to visit Fei Xindun yesterday to discuss protection measures and ordered the district branches to discuss the measures before the market opens. A telegram was sent to Chairman Lin of the National Government and Military Commission Chairman Jiang, rejecting the signing of a treaty that humiliates the country and forfeits its sovereignty. The details are recorded separately as follows.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Second Resumption of Business Committee <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>The Resumption of Business Committee held its second committee meeting at the Citizens' Federation on Xinzha Road at 4:00 PM yesterday. Zhang Yiqing, Hu Fengxiang, Tao Leqin, Yu Hualong, Jiang Junyi, Wang Jianzhuo, Zhang Xianfang, Li Weiliang, Secretary Cao Zhigong, and Ren Jinpin attended. Hu Fengxiang was elected as chairman and Cao Zhigong as secretary. The chairman first reported, followed by Jiang Junyi reporting on the contact with the Public Works Bureau regarding the protection of the opening of the market, and then discussed. (1) The proposal to release a declaration to open the market with pain was resolved and passed. (2) The proposal on whether to issue a separate clear notice on the opening day was resolved and announced in the newspaper. (3) How should the patrol donation and rent in the Hongkou district, which have already been collected, be dealt with? It was resolved to send a letter to the Public Works Bureau and the Chinese Property Association to find a way to handle it.</p>
<h3 id="e15">The Process of Visiting Fei Xindun <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>At 10:00 AM yesterday, the All-Road Business Federation of the Citizens' Federation sent representatives Jiang Junyi and Zhou Fuzhang to visit Fei Xindun, the director of the Public Works Bureau of the Public Concession. They stated the significance of the official letter and the proposed five measures in English, and solemnly told Director Fei that before the Shanghai incident, riots of destroying shops had occurred on North Sichuan Road. Our representatives came to see you, Director, and asked you to pay serious attention. At that time, Director Li Yan of the Public Works Bureau said that they could not be responsible outside the Concession, and they would be responsible for protection within the Concession. Please tell all citizens to rest assured and not worry. Unfortunately, the facts were just the opposite, which is a great regret. Now, our association has resolved to open the market on April 1. Because there are still Japanese soldiers in the Hongkou area, people's hearts are difficult to stabilize. Now that you, Director, are saying that you are trying to get them to withdraw, our representative believes that this work should be carried out diligently before the Japanese soldiers withdraw, that is, the police department should investigate the actual number of Japanese soldiers and naval marines in Hongkou, and increase the number of Chinese and Western police posts, and dispatch the International Volunteer Corps. In case of illegal actions, corresponding sanctions can be imposed at any time to protect the safety of residents. This should be given serious attention by you, Director. Director Fei promised to handle it immediately and said that he would discuss the contributed security plan with the Chief Patrol and the Commander of the Garrison International Volunteer Corps, and will reply in writing, and asked the representatives to come and discuss it together. The citizens who were detained by the Japanese soldiers have also been rescued by the Public Works Bureau. If there are still those who have not been released after the investigation, they will be rescued.

<p>Yesterday, a declaration to open the market with pain was released, saying: Everyone who knows a little about economics and business production knows that closing the market is a policy of suicide. If businessmen disregard suicide and rise up to close the market, then the pain given by their environment must be more than suicide. Therefore, the closure of the market by businessmen is because there is pain worse than suicide, so they are willing to use the spirit of disregard for life and death to strive to reduce the pain that is worse than suicide. Therefore, at the time when businessmen disregard suicide and rise up to close the market, those who are responsible for protecting businessmen should do their best to change their environment and reduce their pain. Otherwise, the closure of the market by businessmen is not the suicide of businessmen, but the responsible people do not fulfill their duty of protection, sit back and watch businessmen suffer every day, indirectly force them, and promote their suicide. Our closure of the market began on January 29, the morning after the violent army invaded the border. At this time, the environment in which we were in suddenly presented a special deterioration. Our country's territory was ravaged. From the standpoint of middle-class people, we have the pain of national disaster. The neutrality and municipal power of the Public Works Bureau of the Public Concession were destroyed. From the standpoint of taxpayers in the Concession, we have the pain of municipal robbery. Merchants in the Hongkou area north of the Suzhou River were searched, arrested, and killed. From the standpoint of being businessmen, we have the pain of being hurt by the same kind and the disaster spreading to ourselves. The pain was so deep that we closed the market without waiting for an agreement and called each other for resistance. The so-called resistance means urging the government to resist, urging the Public Works Bureau to resist, and resisting for the victims and ourselves. Therefore, our closure of the market once marked its requirements. The main purpose of the initial requirements was to eliminate violence, hoping that the government and the Public Works Bureau could rise up and fulfill their duties to eliminate the terror environment and give the pain that is worse than suicide to stop our suicide. Later, because the government failed to fully increase its reinforcements and let the violence encircle the isolated army, the Public Works Bureau failed to fully fulfill its responsibilities and let the Japanese run rampant, the pain we felt at that time was actually worse than at the beginning of the closure of the market. Therefore, although there were those who sympathized with our heavy responsibility and excessive sacrifice and advised us to open the market, we understood this kindness, carefully examined the environment, and deeply felt that in order to achieve the purpose of slightly reducing the pain, it was necessary to continue the struggle. It seems that the actions of the government and the Public Works Bureau do not have the intention of absolutely abandoning us. Therefore, we must continue to use the spirit of sacrifice to actively supervise the government and the Public Works Bureau. Therefore, we issued a declaration again and re-hung the requirements, one to seek the government's emotion, send troops to increase reinforcements, and one to urge the Public Works Bureau to learn and regain police power. In recent days, the government has telegraphed to us that it has fully prepared for the front line, and the Public Works Bureau has also sent a letter telling us that it will strive to regain police power, which seems to be more than just empty words. Although our goal of restoring Shanghai and driving out violence has not been fully achieved, we cannot but jointly plan on how to help the authorities fulfill their responsibilities. We also received instructions from the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau to find ways to open the market. Therefore, on March 27, we convened a meeting and decided to open the market with pain on April 1. In addition to the organized Resumption of Business Committee to discuss various difficult problems after the resumption of business, we plan to unite all sectors to implement savings and promote the ambition of self-defense to strengthen the economic strength and assist the government's resistance plan, in order to recover the lost land and make the Public Works Bureau fully prepared, and have something to rely on to prevent riots. Other things such as helping the poor and helping the needy, developing industry and production, and running schools and preventing disasters can also be carried out jointly, which can be used to resist foreign insults, prosper the family, and contribute to the call to go to national disaster together. For this reason, with tears and pain, we announce the opening of the market, and may our members always abide by it, and hope that other public groups and individuals will eliminate the different views of the past, express the contributions of cooperation in the future, do not show off their temper, do not compete for private disputes, from Shanghai to Jiangsu, from Jiangsu to the country, and combine the strength of foreign scholars to protect it, so that the violent enemy collapses and the nation shines, which can be expected. This is the declaration, I hope you will appreciate it.</p>

<p>To Lin Jun, Chairman of the National Government, Nanjing:</p>
<p>We have respectfully received your telegram. We have publicly decided to reluctantly reopen the market on April 1 and implement savings plans to serve as a backing. Please do not violate the principles of long-term resistance and refuse to sign treaties that forfeit rights and humiliate the nation. We present our words with tears and await your reply.</p>

<h3 id="e19">Telegram to the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>To the Honorable Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, Nanjing:</p>
<p>The organization of the League of Nations' investigation team predates the Shanghai Incident. Military experts account for three out of five members. Judging by their actions, we know their investigation focuses primarily on military matters. Since the Shanghai battle, our military strength has become evident. We ask that you express our initial resolve to resist to the investigation team while upholding the League of Nations' principles. The entire nation will serve as our backing.</p>
<p>The struggle between the strong and the weak and the survival of our nation hinge on your words, Your Excellency. During the Sino-French War, figures like Feng Zicai faced even greater challenges and still defeated powerful enemies. Deng Shichang and Liu Yongfu's weaponry was far inferior to what we have today, yet they achieved heroic feats. Had they sought peace then, victory would have been hard-won.</p>
<p>The global economic crisis is a result of the European War. The fate of China's market is tied to the prosperity and decline of other nations. France fears Germany and Italy and dares not send troops to aid Japan. Britain, warned by the Shanghai battle, cannot collude with Japan. Soviet Russia is changing its policies, and the decision for war between Japan and the United States rests with us.</p>
<p>Inferior military equipment is indeed a factor in determining victory. However, a spirit of daring to fight is a weapon that can defeat the enemy. Moreover, we have a patriotic populace, while Japan faces calls for peace. In terms of economic support, the strengths and weaknesses are already clear. Even a fool knows the odds of winning or losing.</p>
<p>We hope that Your Excellency will uphold the glory of the Northern Expedition and create an immortal cause by defending against aggression and saving the country. We urge you to be a pioneer and not be misled by the environment, causing disappointment across the nation. We urgently present our words and earnestly request your careful consideration.</p>

<h3 id="e30">Banquet for British Fleet Commander Admiral Kelly <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Kelly Gave Sincere Speech. On Tuesday noon, the Lianhua General Association hosted a banquet for Admiral Kelly, Commander of the British Fleet stationed in China. Most of the well-known Chinese businessmen in this city attended. Admiral Kelly delivered a speech on the spot, emphasizing the necessity of cooperation between China and foreign countries. If China and Britain can work together, the benefits to the people of both countries will be immeasurable, as there are many areas where the two countries rely on each other. Taking China's railway transportation as an example, if it can be thoroughly developed, it can create countless jobs and happiness for the people of China and Britain. However, to achieve this goal, the safety of merchants and investors must be taken into account, and the Chinese people must also abandon their suspicion of foreigners. The most important thing to do today is to bring Chinese and foreigners closer together. If this is done, many disputes between the two sides can be resolved through mutual affection. For example, many Chinese naval officers are trained in Britain, and when something happens, they often reveal their wishes to one or two officers they have known for a long time, and the matter is easily resolved. Kelly also said that although he is a soldier, he is very opposed to resolving international disputes through war, because in his experience, the defeated country, of course, is not to be considered, but even the victorious country has no benefits to gain. If a country is defeated, its finances and commerce will be broken, which will immediately affect the markets of all other countries in the world, and the victorious country cannot avoid it. For example, the salary he receives now has to pay income tax of five shillings per pound, which is due to the European War. Therefore, the way to resolve international disputes should be to abandon war and replace it with friendly cooperation between the representatives of each country. He believes that the problem of road construction outside the concession and the current Sino-Japanese dispute can be properly resolved in a cup of wine and conversation. The method is much more convenient than the use of guns and cannons. His invitation to Chinese and Japanese representatives to meet on his flagship is to try to use this method. He believes that nothing can better promote cooperation between the Chinese and British people and other foreigners than the Lianhua General Association. This is an international general association, and the purpose of its organization is to connect the friendship of various countries. Why not use it? After Kelly finished speaking, the audience applauded and welcomed him, all thinking that it was a good word for the times.</p>

<h3 id="e31">Tragic Ferry Overturn Accident Last Night <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>More Than Thirty Female Workers Drowned</p>
<p>At 7:45 PM last night, the Customs' "Mirror Light" launch collided with and overturned a ferry outside the Yongxing Flower Garment Factory in Lujiazui, Pudong, drowning approximately thirty female workers from the Nanyang Tobacco Factory. The family members of the deceased wailed and cried, creating an extremely tragic scene. The detailed circumstances of the accident are described below.</p>
<h3 id="e32">Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Factory <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>On Zhaofeng Road, Hongkou, a portion of the female workers reside in Pudong. Every morning, they take a ferry from the north side of the Yongxing Flower Garment Factory in Lujiazui, Pudong, to cross the river and enter the factory. In the evening, they still take the ferry home. Since the Shanghai war, the Chinese female workers in the factory have returned to their hometowns to avoid the disaster, leaving many vacancies. The unemployed skilled female workers along the Pudong River should be recruited by the factory to fill the vacancies, so</p>
<h3 id="e33">Pudong Female Workers in the Factory <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Are more numerous than before. They still rely on the original wooden ferry to cross the river for work. Although the hull of the boat is larger than ordinary ferries, it can carry six or seventy passengers each time, which is crowded and dangerous. This ferry is jointly owned by four Shandong people, who take turns managing it and own 26 ferries. This session is managed by Zhu Fuxiang. All the boats are subleased to others for rowing, and each boat is charged a monthly rent of eight yuan. At around 7:00 PM last night, the Nanyang Tobacco Factory was just getting off work. A group of Pudong female workers gathered at the Zhaofeng pier and boarded the</p>
<h3 id="e34">Ferry to Return Home <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>At that time, the ferry owned by Jiang A'fa, with four boatmen, carried more than 60 passengers and rowed towards Pudong. When the boat was about two zhang (丈, *zhàng*: a unit of length, approx. 3.3 meters) away from the Jardine Matheson tugboat anchored outside the Yongxing Warehouse, the Customs' "Mirror Light" launch, on its way back after transporting Customs River Affairs Department personnel to Wu[song], encountered the ferry. In the darkness, it was too late to avoid a collision. The bow of the "Mirror Light" directly</p>
<h3 id="e35">Violently Struck the Port Side of the Ferry <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>The ferry was unable to withstand the impact and tilted to the left. Passengers and boatmen fell into the river together, causing cries for help and desperate wailing, creating a very tragic scene. Nearby warships immediately shone their searchlights to facilitate rescue. When the captain of the "Mirror Light", Wang Xiaofu, saw the accident, he immediately reversed the engine and stopped, throwing down lifebuoys and bamboo poles to rescue people. On the spot, they</p>
<h3 id="e36">Rescued More Than Twenty Female Workers <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>At the same time, the Customs Water Police Station also dispatched detectives Shen Changshan, Deng Jiagen, and Hu Changchun to rescue seven or eight people by boat. All four boatmen were also rescued. However, approximately</p>
<h3 id="e37">Thirty Female Workers Tragically Drowned <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>And disappeared without a trace. Detective Jiang [surname] from the ferry boat company took the boatman Xu Linsheng to the police station for questioning, and then brought the shipowner Jiang A'fa to the case for questioning. All the rescued female workers were sent home separately. Some of them were unconscious due to drinking too much water, and some of the female workers were pregnant or heavily pregnant, making the scene even more tragic.</p>
<h3 id="e38">After Investigation, the Names of the Deceased Female Workers <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>

<p>And instructed the family members of the deceased to identify the bodies, claim them for burial, and await verification. In order to understand the circumstances of the accident, the Customs Port Director specially summoned the captain of the "Mirror Light", Wang Xiaofu, and the ferry owner, Jiang A'fa, to the case yesterday morning for questioning. He then instructed the Water Police Station to send Wang Haiquan and the witness, Zhao Aying, a female worker, to the local court for further investigation. Regarding the</p>

<p>After the January 28th Shanghai Incident, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's National Goods Market spared no effort to implement a strike to resist the invasion. Now, after two months, as all sectors reluctantly decided to reopen the market on a regular basis, the market, which has always aimed at promoting national goods, will take the same action as all sectors. The Chamber of Commerce has convened a meeting of manufacturers' representatives on the 23rd and 29th of this month, and it has been publicly decided that the market will reopen on April 1. Personnel have been dispatched from various factories and shops to sort out and prepare timely goods to meet the needs of customers. However, due to the different curfew times in the Chinese and Rental Concessions in recent days, the business hours will be temporarily changed to 9:00 AM to 7:00 PM daily.</p>

<p>The British Bovril Beef Juice Company held its 35th annual general meeting in London on February 24 this year, chaired by Sir Pan Wenhēng. A detailed report was given on the general situation of the company's operations and the business progress of various branches. Due to the global economic downturn and dramatic exchange rate changes, all industries have suffered setbacks. However, the sales of Bovril Beef Juice, both at home and abroad, are still very strong. Recently, a well-known American publication published an article entitled "The English Bottle," praising Bovril's sales for 25 years and its nourishing effects have been deeply trusted by the world. It also said that vitamins and hormones invented by modern people, even if taken in large quantities every day, are of no help to life. The reason is that what human beings rely on for survival are food elements such as proteins. If human beings want to be competent for all hardships, they should first pay attention to their physical health. Therefore, taking Bovril Beef Juice on time is truly the only key to nourishing and protecting health.</p>

<p>In the article "The Establishment of the Water Police Team" in your newspaper, it was mentioned that a certain [missing text] reported that the Japanese army has organized a water patrol team since yesterday, consisting of two steamships, each with more than 20 armed Japanese naval personnel patrolling the area along the Pujiang River in Gaoqiao, Pudong, day and night, but they have not landed. After investigation, there is no Japanese army organizing a water patrol team in Pujiang, and the captain of this team has not received a report, nor has he transferred any of the above information to any organization.

<p>Yesterday, the 20th, the gold market was relatively stable, with an upward trend, having broken through the 680 tael mark. This was due to divergent trends in overseas silver markets, with British silver falling and American silver rising. However, exchange rates differed significantly, with the US dollar recovering 6.625 points against the British pound. Consequently, dealers were hesitant, causing the initial gold price to stabilize. It seemed to be moving in opposite directions to the US dollar, with British dealers selling and American dealers supporting. This was the opposite of the previous day. Moreover, buyers on the open market were aggressive, leading to a sharp market, with only slight consolidation during the morning and noon sessions. Ultimately, the price rebounded by over 5 taels. A record of past conditions follows: From the opening, there was no difference between good and bad silver, and the price was the same as the previous noon's closing at 674.5 taels. Large bars of silver all fell by a quarter, while American silver rose by three-eighths. HSBC initially posted a long rate of 25 for the British pound, with no change for the US dollar. Subsequently, Zhifeng Yong, Hengyu, and others entered the market, adding 2 taels, but then retreated by 2 taels, as a result of sales by the Dalian gang. Shortly after, there were fluctuations of over 1 tael up and down by 9.3. Buying sentiment was strong, with Zhifeng Yong, Hongkang Yong, and others buying in, and the internal US dollar initially trading at 33.25 yuan, then at 32.75 yuan. The gold price then rose sharply by over 3 taels, reaching 79.5 taels by almost 10 o'clock. At this time, American and Japanese banks were trading April US dollars at 32.8125 yuan, which immediately retreated to 77.5 taels. Qianchang Xiangyuan Tailai bought. At 10:12, it was 79 taels and 3 mace. Shortly after, Shanghai offered April British gold at 8 pence and 875. The China-Belgium Bank bought June US dollars at 33.0625 yuan, and Yuanheng Hongkang Yong and others sold. In just ten minutes, it dropped by 2.5 taels, reaching 76 taels and 8 mace around 10:20. Subsequently, a certain bank absorbed over 100 bars of spot silver, which were sold through Yingheng, Jing, and other spot silver houses. Yuan and others bought in, rising by over 4 taels, with a slight gain of over 1 tael, while April US dollars only settled at 32.75 yuan. Only the British pound remained stable. There was a 9-point increase. At 11 o'clock, it broke through 80 taels, followed by a slight consolidation. At 11:45, it was 81 taels and 2 mace. Subsequently, ticket transactions were not smooth.

By the noon closing, it was 80 taels and 2 mace, a rebound of 5 taels and 7 mace compared to the previous noon.

<p>[Banquet]</p>
<p>During the [banquet], there were performances. Chiang gave a brief welcome speech, which Gu Weijun translated. He stated that he was very pleased to be able to gather with the members of the League of Nations Investigation Team. At this time of bright spring, he was glad to meet with the members. He had originally wanted to accompany the members on a tour of various places as a warmer welcome, but given the unfortunate incident between China and Japan, the members had important responsibilities and could not delay. China has always been a nation of benevolence and righteousness, and has always based its friendships on loyalty, honesty, and sincerity. This is not only true of personal interactions, but also of international interactions. China is an ancient country with a long history and beautiful culture, a large population, and vast land and resources. The transition from an old country to a new country has been slow during the transitional period, but the government and people are determined, and there is unlimited hope for the future. The members are traveling around to investigate countries with history and culture, and the Chinese government is very willing to provide the members with all kinds of convenience and assistance, so that the members will not experience any difficulties, in order to fulfill the duty of a host. As for the investigation, the Chinese government is even more willing to provide as much material as possible for the members' reference. The chairman of the investigation team, Lord Lytton, gave a reply, stating that he was very grateful for the warm hospitality of Chairman Chiang. He knew that Chairman Chiang was a modern hero of China. Before arriving in China, he had already known Chairman Chiang's name, because Chairman Chiang was not only a modern hero of China, but also a capable military strategist and a well-known politician in the world. This time, his team was ordered by the League of Nations to come to your country to investigate the Manchurian Incident, and they will do their best to fulfill their mission. After the speeches, the guests talked casually, and the event ended at around 11 PM. (Dispatch on the 30th)</p>

<p>Difficult to Maintain Operations, May Lead to Disputes (Harbin) It is learned that by March 15th, more than 100 locomotives on the Chinese Eastern Railway had entered Russian territory, accounting for 85% of the total. The company is now suffering from a severe shortage of locomotives, and trains are often delayed. Approximately 70% of the freight cars have entered Russia, resulting in a significant decrease in the company's revenue. The amount of revenue is not enough to cover expenses. It is now believed that the above numbers are very accurate. Therefore, the Manchurian government must now decide whether to purchase new locomotives and freight cars or to request the Soviet Union to return the cars to their original routes. However, under no circumstances will the cars be returned without a new agreement being reached. This matter may be delayed for several months. According to railway experts, it is difficult for the railway to maintain operations unless most of the freight cars that have entered Russia are returned. This is a very complex issue and may lead to major disputes. In addition to the trains, valuable machinery and railway materials have also been transported to Russia.

<p>(Shenyang) According to Japanese newspapers here this morning, their attitude towards the issue of customs duties in the Northeast is as follows: (1) All customs and tax revenues in the Northeast will henceforth belong to the new government. (2) Because customs duties have always been a pledge for foreign debts and reparations, Manchuria will allow the customs of the Northeast to remain under the administration of the Inspector General of Customs. However, if customs personnel, tariff rates, or regulations are to be changed, the new government must be notified. (3) Regarding foreign debts and reparations secured by customs duties, the new state will recognize and repay the amount allocated to the Northeast. (Reuters dispatch from the 30th)</p>

<p>Refutes Japan's accusations layer by layer. Japan's representative to the League of Nations to be replaced by Nagaoka. Geneva, 30th - China's chief representative to the League of Nations, Yan Huiqing, sent a memorandum to the League of Nations Secretariat yesterday, strongly refuting the false claims made by Japan in its note to the League of Nations on February 2nd, alleging that the Chinese government's foreign policy was uncompromising and xenophobic. The memorandum, which was released today, states that the Japanese claims are absolutely untrue. The tens of thousands of foreigners residing and working in China can attest to the friendly and peaceful attitude of the Chinese people towards all foreigners. As for Japan's claim that the boycott of Japanese goods has intensified in recent years, customs statistics show that before September of last year, the import of Japanese goods into China gradually increased, threatening to control the entire market. Finally, it emphasizes that the world will deeply understand the Chinese government and people's calm reaction to Japan's acts of aggression in Manchuria and Shanghai.</p>

<p>Provinces Make Huge Demands Making It Difficult to Compile New Japanese Budget. Tokyo, 30th - The government exchanged views in a cabinet meeting yesterday regarding the proposal to convene a second extraordinary Diet. According to reports, it will likely be convened around May 20th, with a session lasting three weeks. Reuters, Tokyo, 20th - The cabinet approved the budget for the next fiscal year today. The budget provides for total expenditures of 1,452,000,000 yen and estimated revenues of 1,384,000,000 yen, leaving a shortfall of 68 million yen. The cabinet also decided to consider a supplementary budget for new projects on April 7th.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 30th - Finance Minister Takahashi explained issues such as industrial policy and public debt at today's budget cabinet meeting, stating that the recent financial difficulties were extreme and that the budget's deficit was unprecedented. However, observing the recent financial situation, although the people's livelihood has not improved, their spirit has shown signs of recovery. The revenue shortfall for the seventh fiscal year will be financed by issuing public bonds. The current national finances are extremely poor, so the financial authorities hope that each province will cancel unnecessary supplementary budgets, but will consider approving budgets for important projects.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 20th - The Ministry of Foreign Affairs requested 39 million yen for its budget for the seventh year of Showa from the Ministry of Finance, but the cabinet decided yesterday to reduce the ministry's budget to 955,000 yen.

It is said that such a huge requested amount is unprecedented since the European War.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 30th - New budget requests submitted by each province to the Budget Bureau of the Ministry of Finance include 80 million yen from the Ministry of Interior and 50 million yen from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, totaling 200 million yen.

After receiving this notice, the authorities in each province held provincial council meetings to discuss countermeasures. As a result, they fiercely demanded that the Budget Bureau approve the original proposal. However, the budget authorities, citing financial difficulties, decided to reject all requests.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 30th - The Ministry of Colonial Affairs has decided to request 30 million yen from the Ministry of Finance for various expenses in Manchuria and Mongolia, to be submitted to the second extraordinary Diet for deliberation.</p>
<h3 id="e98">South Irish Cabinet Agrees to Reply to British Letter <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>British Independent Labor Party Congress Passes Motion Recognizing Irish Polity to be Determined by People Reuters, Dublin, 30th - The leader of the South Irish government, Eamon de Valera, met with cabinet members here today and presented a draft of the reply to the British government regarding the oath and land annuities. It is reported that the cabinet members fully agreed with the contents of the reply. After several hours of deliberation, the cabinet instructed the Minister of Justice to draft a formal reply. The South Irish representative stationed in London will stay in Dublin until the end of this week and will likely go to London tomorrow night to deliver this document to the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, Thomas. It is expected that the British government will issue another rebuttal upon receiving this document. All exchanges will likely be made public simultaneously in London and Dublin after this issue is resolved. It is speculated that Eamon de Valera will say in this reply that the abolition of the oath does not violate the treaty, and that the oath clause is merely a non-mandatory phrase that does not have legally binding effect. The so-called oath has always been a farce. He has decided to proceed with the abolition of the oath after a meeting of the Parliament. As for the land annuities, they are not within the scope of the treaty. In short, South Ireland's abolition of the oath and withholding of land annuities is not comparable to contempt for the treaty, but is merely an act in accordance with the wishes of the people of South Ireland.</p>
<p>Reuters, Dublin, 30th - The Independent Labour Party met today in Blackrock and passed a provisional motion recognizing that the Irish people have the right to determine their own polity. The motion was proposed by Labour MP Maxton.</p>

<h3 id="e99">Account of the Northeast Volunteer Army's Attack on Zhuanghe <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Traitor Wang Youcai and Japanese collaborator killed. Japanese army counterattacks successfully, commits large-scale arson and murder. Dalian Correspondence - Zhuanghe County, located 280 li from Dalian, has had its county magistrate dismissed by the Japanese since the September 18th Incident. The Japanese appointed the traitor Wang Youcai as the county magistrate. Wang's pro-Japanese stance was well-known to the people of the county, so when he took office, the people rose up in opposition. Wang carried out his traitorous acts, hiring a Japanese man named Sakurai as a county advisor for protection. Wang also carried out revenge for personal grudges on a large scale, leading to the persecution of many good people. He also acted as an accomplice, suppressing patriotic education in schools (referred to by the Japanese as anti-Japanese education). The county people were very angry and publicly elected a representative, Mr. Liu, to present the public opinion to Wang and point out his traitorous acts. Wang was furious and accused Liu of being a reactionary, detaining him and planning to execute him. The people of the entire county were in uproar, gathering thousands of people who knelt and cried in front of the county office, demanding Liu's release. Wang had no choice but to release Liu. Liu was originally a good man from the county, 62 years old, with private property worth 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. After being released, he was so angry that he did not want to live and, under the guise of fleeing to another place, moved his family out of Zhuanghe. In reality, he joined the 8th Route of the Northeast Volunteer Army. The general commander of this route was Deng Tiecheng. Deng served as the police chief of Fengcheng County in 1927. After Liu joined, he bankrupted his family and recruited new soldiers. Many patriotic people in the countryside joined the army. Before long, he had over 5,000 men. They used Dagu Mountain City Duizi as their base and attacked Zhuanghe County. When Wang Youcai received the news, he immediately closed the city gates. On the one hand, he telegraphed the Japanese in Dalian for assistance. Unexpectedly, the people and staff of various organizations in the city were also very angry with Wang and rose up to act as internal support for the Volunteer Army, blowing up the city gate. Wang had no way out and retreated to the County Office, closing the doors and awaiting Japanese reinforcements. The Volunteer Army, with Liu as the vanguard, entered the city on the 21st and immediately surrounded the County Office, setting it on fire with coal. Wang had no way out and came out to beg for his life. He was immediately arrested, along with his wife, five daughters, and one Japanese advisor, and they were all executed by shooting in front of the County Office. The commander of the Japanese Kwantung Army, Honjo Shigeru, received this alarm and urgently dispatched 3,000 Japanese garrison troops stationed in Lushun to aid Zhuanghe. On the 24th, the Japanese army arrived and the two sides engaged in a fierce battle. The Volunteer Army did not show any weakness, but because they lacked artillery, they suffered quite a few casualties. The Japanese launched a fierce attack but were unable to succeed, so they dispatched 30 Japanese aircraft from Shenyang to assist in the battle. Seeing that the situation was unfavorable, the Volunteer Army retreated to Cheng Duizi. When the Japanese army drove the Volunteer Army out of Zhuanghe, they massacred all the county residents. Now, Japanese planes circle daily over Zhuanghe, dropping 30- to 80-pound bombs. All the houses and buildings in the city have been destroyed by the bombs, and more than 2,000 innocent people have died. The county town has become a pile of rubble, a truly tragic scene.

<h3 id="e101">Feng Yuxiang Recuperating on Mount Tai <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— Fo</p>
<p>Although Feng Yuxiang is not the most admired and respected figure in my mind, he is at least a most peculiar and noteworthy character.</p>
<p>Feng Yuxiang took a special train to Mount Tai on the 23rd to recuperate. The county magistrate, Zhou Baihuang, reported to Feng that he had prepared a residence at the Doumu Palace and that all necessary items had been equipped. Feng immediately asked him if the money used was his own private funds or the people's money and by what right he had taken it to buy items to prepare a residence for him. I have come here to recuperate, and not a single plant or tree belonging to the people is allowed to be used. Zhou Baihuang retreated in shame. Therefore, Feng did not stay at the Doumu Palace but temporarily changed to the Puzhao Temple.</p>
<p>This small anecdote deserves our full approval. I ask, among the important figures in today's National Government, which one is not greedy? Which one does not want to be supplied by others? Which one does not want to use the people's property? Such self-disciplined individuals are rare among today's government officials except for Feng. Some might say that Feng's attitude is completely deceptive and contrived. I also admit that Feng is contrived because humans are inherently evil. Mencius also said that food and sex are human nature. If Feng's pretense is truly consistent, I would consider his merits and believe he is better than others. If all the important figures in the National Government today were willing to pretend like Feng, not accepting supplies from others and not using the people's property, I don't think the government would have ended up in this state, and society would not have ended up in this state.</p>
<p>However, I still have a question. It is said that Feng's entourage on this trip to Mount Tai includes over a hundred attendants, doctors, and guards. I don't know where the supplies for these people come from. Does Feng take out his own private money to supply them, or do the hundred or so attendants and guards provide for themselves? If it is said that Feng completely takes out his personal private money to supply them, then I must ask where Feng's money comes from—inheritance or officialdom?</p>
<p>Feng is everywhere showing civilian attitudes, not wanting to consider himself a great man, not wanting to consider himself a member of the Central Committee. However, to be a civilian recovering from illness and to bring with him an entourage of over a hundred attendants and guards—such a civilian is rare. At the very least, he can be called a special civilian.</p>
<p>I deeply admire Feng's self-discipline and integrity. The above is intended to be a critique, not to suggest that Feng should also learn the extravagance and debauchery of other important figures to be satisfied. I only deeply hope that Feng's civilianization can be more thorough and more complete, which would be even more admirable.</p>

<h3 id="e102">Lamenting the Loss of Shanghai on March 2nd, Composed in Anger <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Zhuzun</p>
<p>The 19th Route Army fought against the Japanese in Shanghai and repeatedly defeated the strong enemy. Since the Japanese army in Shanghai became more numerous on February 21st, our army's reinforcements were insufficient, and the enemy took advantage of the weakness and landed in Liuhe. As a result, the entire line wavered, and Shanghai was occupied by the enemy. The people of the country mourned the 19th Route Army's determination to resist Japan and grieved the lack of support. Therefore, this poem was written:</p>
<p>On February 26th, I was shocked to hear that Jiangwan was lost. On the morning of March 2nd, I heard that Zhabei had been abandoned. Between noon and late afternoon of the same day, Shanghai was occupied by the enemy. Residents fled in panic, everyone trembling. When I first heard the bad news, I couldn't help but shed tears. Tracing back to the Shenyang Incident, it has been six months now. The Northeast did not resist, and the national situation declined. The central government has no leader, and public opinion is in uproar. Officials wrongly speak of peace, while scholars strongly advocate war. Party opinions diverge, and national plans are repeatedly suspended. Although there is talk of peace internally, there are still divisions. Some go east to the sea, and some go south to Guangdong. Diplomacy is incompetent, and the Japanese disaster becomes increasingly severe. The Shanghai crisis came suddenly, but there was no response. The valiant army fought hard, but there were no reinforcements. The enemy took advantage of the weakness in Liuhe and drove straight in. The victory won after thirty days of fighting was lost overnight. Who is to blame for this disaster? Some want to ask the warlords, who command large armies, why do you alone live in comfort? For twenty years you have waged civil wars, with what ambition and energy? How is it that when the Japanese invaders come, you look at them as if they were foreigners? Now that you do not share the same heart, how can you escape alone? If you say your weapons are inferior, you should wait for revenge in future years. However, for several months now, have you not been aware of the enemy's situation? Why did you not prepare earlier to respond to the sudden crisis? The warlords seem ashamed, lowering their heads and saying to me, "Please ask the party members, party power is above all else." I now tell the people of the country to stop talking about the past. From today onwards, please unite with one heart. Persevere even if you fail a hundred times, let alone just once. If 400 million compatriots can all shed blood, let their blood be stored into a sea, as wide as the Pacific Ocean. Use it to drown the enemy, and the entire nation will be established and freed. Do not be discouraged by a temporary defeat, or waste time lamenting.</p>

<h3 id="e103">The Method of Making Laughing Gas <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— Sunlight</p>
<p>The chemical name of laughing gas is nitrous oxide, and its chemical formula is N2O. Because people laugh uncontrollably after inhaling this gas, due to its anesthetic effect on the nerves, it is called laughing gas. Laughing gas was discovered by Priestley in 1772. He used the reduction method to convert nitric oxide into nitrous oxide (using wet iron filings as the reducing agent). However, we have a more convenient manufacturing method:</p>
<p>Take a bottle fitted with a glass tube. Inside, place some ammonium nitrate purchased from a pharmacy. Slowly heat the bottle with a fire. The ammonium nitrate will decompose into water and nitrous oxide (laughing gas). Nitrous oxide is a gas, so it will escape through the glass tube. Because laughing gas can dissolve in cold water, we must use the warm water displacement method to collect it. First, fill a bottle with warm water and invert it into a basin of warm water (when inverting, cover the full bottle of warm water with a glass plate or other thin sheet of iron or wood, then invert it, place it in the water, and then remove the cover). Insert the tube into the mouth of the collection bottle, and the laughing gas will displace the water, occupying the space inside the bottle.</p>
<p>I have a point to declare to the readers, which is that, because laughing gas is an anesthetic, inhaling too much is dangerous. If readers follow the method to manufacture it but do not know that it is an anesthetic and inhale it into the trachea as much as possible, causing harm, then I will not only have no merit but will instead be guilty. I hope those who wish to experiment will take note.</p>
<h3 id="e104">The World's Oldest Map in Clay <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— A Hidden One</p>
<p>Recently, under the guidance of Professor Albert T. Clay of Harvard University, at a place 200 miles north of Babylon, at the ancient site of Nuzi, a map over four thousand years old, the world's oldest, was excavated. This map is made of a clay tablet. It was originally invented by the ancient Mesopotamians. The clay tablet is engraved with many cuneiform characters. The tablet is three inches long and two and five-eighths inches wide, exquisitely crafted and can fit in the palm of your hand.</p>
<p>This clay tablet was buried about twenty feet deep in the mud. When it was excavated, because the surrounding area was contaminated with mud and the material was extremely soft, it was not easy to wash. Later, after five days and nights, it gradually dried. Then it was placed in a high-temperature kiln and baked, only then peeling off the attached mud.</p>
<p>It was then studied and identified by experts in Sumerian and Akkadian languages. The map is a part of the Arrapha region. The face of the map details the place names in each location. From north to south, a large river flows through the middle. Further, at the bottom of the map, three mountains are close to the south bank. The shape of the map is exactly the same as the situation in the Babylonian era centuries later, so archaeologists judged it to be something from four thousand years ago. However, because of the changes in the times, the shape of that country has also changed a lot. Among them, the only clearly interpretable is the fortress text of "Ibla". According to the locals near the excavation site, in the Old Testament and the Quran, the so-called "original furnace" and "eternal light" are very close. Because this place is a perennial site where a type of anhydrous sulfurous acid flame leaks from the underground cave.</p>
<p>Correction: In the article about Chlorine gas published on the 27th of this month, all the "gas" characters in "Manganese Dioxide" were mistakenly printed as "oxygen" characters. Also, the "gas" character in "Manganese gas" in the equation was also mistakenly printed as "　" character. This correction is hereby made.</p>
