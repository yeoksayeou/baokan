<p>（東京）外務省頃由日内瓦代表團接到請訓電報、略謂日代表因國聨擬將報告書及意見書交大會審議、在理事會席上聲明請訓本國政府、議長要求表示接受回訓之時期、然未與言質、請即回訓（二十六日日聨電）</p>
<p>（東京）日外部今晨十時開會議、决定訓電内容如左㈠凡勒拉主席之提議、欲將中日紛爭提交大會審議、此問題日本自今春大會以來、就反對以會章第十五條解决滿案對此保留斷不能變更、然若以手續問題而開大會則不必堅持反對、㈡如果要開大會、必須將二十一日以來之論爭記錄移交大會、行政會如要加附意見提交大會、代表團須再請訓㈢當行政會移交大會討論時必須明確記載日本之保留事項同時將該記錄一齊送交大會（二十六日華聨電）</p>
<p>（東京）外務省發言人今日宣稱日政府已有訓令致日内瓦日代表團、如中日問題由國聨行政院移交特别大會、則日代表不妨參加會議、惟將反對援引國聨盟約第十五條解决爭案、日本仍主依國聨盟約第十一條辦理此案、日本以爲行政院應更密切討論李頓報告書、但諸理事未表示有此傾向、日本此次不欲放棄投票權、但對特别大會提出之任何不能接受之决議案、將投反對票、日本以爲根據國聨盟約第十一條召集之特别大會、其所通過之任何决議案、必須得一致之同意、始能發生效力云、又謂如有必要、日本準備參加十九特委會會議、惟將以不得視日如法庭罪人爲條件、（二十六日路透電）</p>

<p>（日内瓦）國聨行政院今日會議之顯著發展、爲中日問題堤交國聨大會特會之提議、顧博士立即代表接受此議、而日代表則欲請示其本國政府、行政院在日代表宣讀其書面文後、予以登記、然後請李頓動爵列坐於行政院理事席、</p>
<h3 id="c5">主席凡勒拉發重要言論 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>主席凡勒拉發重要言論、請雙方對於其所能爲以助國聨者加以嚴密考慮、謂中日雙方旣已陳述其意見今之問題、乃行政院可否再稍待若干時、而後依照一九三二年三月十一日國聨大會决議案中之申請、將此事提交大會之特會、行政院依二月十九日之决議曾照國聨盟約第十五條、將中日爭執提交國聨大會、於是大會受理此事、故目前直接負有謀取解决之責者、厥爲國聨大會、此事之提交大會、並不減少行政院固有之權利、一行政院仍可依照國聨盟約另一條文、自由决定對於報告書之討論、但渠以爲行政院在聽取雙方意見後所决定不另起討論之辦法、完全符合二月十九日行政院將此事提交大會之决議、渠知一般意思、欲大會特會儘速重行討論此事、行政院之理事、亦即大會之會員、將有完全參加大會討論之機會、而彼等之意見將在大會中有更適當之表示、渠與同志於聽取中日代表言論時、皆欲在其言論中覓取同人所可圓滿</p>
<p>迅速解决此項爭端之根據、惟其所聞者、恐絕少可饜滿同人期望之處、日政府在其意見書中未接受調查團所建議之解决原則、惟僅承認［僅僅恢復原狀非解决辦法］一語而已中代表聲明欲保留其權、將來提出對於解决條件之意見、目前僅贊成調查團所建議十個原則中之第三原則即［任何解决須與國聨盟約巴黎公約與九國公約之條文適合］而已、在此種情勢下目前對於李頓報告書、似未有妥協之任何程度、而可爲行政院提出意見與建議俾在實際上有助於大會以决定其解决方法者之根據、渠爲行政院主席</p>
<p>覺有須表示希望者數日來行政院所聞中日代表發表之意見、尙非代表其本國政附之最後意見、任何解决辦法、凡有可公平永遠解决此不幸爭執之可能性者、不致爲雙方所拒絕渠現所言者、不僅代表行政院、且亦代表世界大部份輿情、如和平解决爭點之國聨機關、在牽涉國聨兩個重要會員國如中日者之爭議中、不能積極運用有效、或其運用爲雙方中任何一方必要合作之缺乏所妨碍則直爲不可耐的反抗輿情耳、渠代表行政院、誠懇請求雙方、各向行政院陳述其意見、轉注其目光於此事之積極方面而考慮何者爲其所可行、以助國聨謀取一種解决方案、</p>
<p>（松岡仍要求採和解方式）松岡起言向主席致謝其指導之努力、並表示行政院終必自已辦理此事、並自已研究李頓報告書所載各項建議之信心、松岡指此報告書、爲不可輕易贊成者、松岡且謂調查團是否有提出建議之資格、渠不能無疑、松岡又説明其對於調查團建議若干點不能同意之見解、松岡謂日本會提議直接談判、但此提議未被採納、致事勢乃循其現已莫可挽回之天然途徑而行、處此情勢、渠必須請示於本國政府、但依渠個人意思言、渠覺有依據國聨盟約第十一條試用各種和解方法之必要、此問題極關重要、凡兩國所不能贊成之辦法、决不能解决之、日本欲有遠東之和平、但非約上和平、日本自去年以來、所行之計畫、全以此種主張爲根據、日本必須進行其所以承認［滿洲國］認爲維持遠東和平的唯一方法之政策、渠保留此後發言之權、主席松岡需時幾久、可得東京訓示、松岡答稱、明日午後或至遲星期一日可接覆電云、</p>
<p>顧行表聲明保留發言權中代表顧博士贊成提交大會之建議、但渠保留日後對於李頓報告書所載各種和解條件與原則表示其政府意見之權、蓋以松岡迄未表示其尊重和解原則之願意也顧博士稱、因是之故、今若披露中政府對於報告書其他部份之意見、未必與事有補、渠原來希望松岡至少可接受報告書所載任何解决必須與國聨盟約九國公約與巴黎公約相適合之原則、然松岡今竟謂必須以［現實］丨即滿洲國之承認丨爲根據辦理此事、但中政府絕對反對根據僅僅已成事實、謀取解决、中政府所可接受者、爲根據與國際條約相適合的實有之解决辦法、顧博士後復聲明渠贊成此問題應儘速堤交國聨大會之提議、松岡於顧博士言畢時、呼顧博爲老友、謂渠所言之［現實］一名詞、指各種實有事物而言、當然包括條約國聨及世界其他事特在内云、行政院於松岡説明其與政府接洽之時限後、採主席之建議、允休會至星期一日午前十一時、至是散會、</p>

<h3 id="c32">銀問題與世界經濟會議乃 <a href="#c32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>自資本主義列强間内在與外向的利害衝突。日趨鋭利。國際間會議。乃愈見紛繁。承平無事則閉戶安居。災難當前乃不得不。集鄕鄰以籌對付人情然國際間之形勢亦然。故國際間名目百出之會議。正足表示列强政治家之手足失措。而會議迭出。效果茫然則又大足表示當局者雖鞠躬盡瘁。以圖最後之掙扎。而大勢所趨恐終未能挽此欲倒之狂瀾也</p>
<p>國際間之會議雖多。然大别之。則不外普泛的與局部的二者。前者如過去之銀會議與軍縮會議。以各列强爲中心。而以弱小國爲陪襯後者如洛桑會議與沃太華會議。出席者或爲一部份之列强。或僅限於某帝國主　與其殖民地。就大勢以觀察。則普遍的國際會議。除代若干名人發布若干大而無當高而難行之主張。與一紙虚玄夢想自欺欺人之宣言外。其結果等於無物。而後者則往往尙能擬具一比較切實之方案。而一時的使經濟界表現幾微之變化。如因洛桑會議之結果。而英法德。意一致對美國主張取消戰債。因沃太華會議之結果。而美國减少十萬萬金圓之輸出貿易。凡諸種切均足槪見當此世界恐慌日趨深刻之際資本主義各列强。均處於外强中乾捉襟見肘之苦境。所謂救濟之策要不出我邱鄰。壑。苟延其一已之殘喘。而對於整倘資本主義。則因衝突矛盾之加甚。反愈促其滅亡。欲於普泛的國際會議中。找求一均　之方策。殆爲事勢之所不許。</p>
<p>繼局部的洛桑會議沃太華會議之後。乃復有普泛的世界經濟會議之籌備。蓋英國旣於洛桑會議。掌固歐洲列强對美之陣線。復以沃太華會議表示大不列顚内部之團結與對美之威嚇。浸浸乎已恢復其昔日與美國抗衡之地位。持此以與美國相見　國際議席中。或可冀其稍變暴昔惟我獨尊之態席。接受歐洲列國對於取消戰債之要求。故在歐洲列國心目中。原以戰債問題爲世界經濟會議之主要議題。以故此所謂世界經濟會議者實質上本不過一列强間之賴債會議而已。</p>
<p>美總統胡佛氏旣洞見其隠於是始則有不能議及戰債問題之聲明。繼之則於其競選演講及近日發表談話中提出　　白銀問題爲世界經濟會議之主要議題。吾人於此。有須認明者。則此所謂世界經濟會議者。原不能逃出歷來普泛的國際會議之陳跡。其終於無結果而散。早在意中而銀問題在此會議之地位。旣僅爲胡佛氏對抗歐洲列强以戰債爲主要議題之工具。殆已　於日人往昔在華盛頓會議提出人種平等問題之用意。醉翁之意。旣不在酒則其等於具文。又早可灼見也。</p>
<p>然銀問題在未來的世界經濟會議中。終必須經一度之討論則因銀問題之歷史及其在輿論中之地位。實爲無可避免之事實辦决銀問題之方案。不出二端。其一。爲限制生産。其二爲增加用途。而所謂增加用途者。自以恢復銀幣爲主眼關於此點。在美國輿論中。旣有［銀賤吾人須以銀爲幣棉花賤將亦以棉花爲幣乎］之妙論。而歐洲各國停止金本位以後。統制貨幣説之威權又已遠在國際複本位説之上。故恢復銀幣云云。殆已成爲陳跡。則將來議論之中心。其必爲限制生産蓋無疑也。</p>
<p>言限制生産則衝突又生世界之最大産。銀國美國及墨西哥。必以銀價慘跌。歸咎於印度之出售存銀。而印度之保護國英國則必否認其説。而主張銀礦生産之限制。此二者旣各有其理由。則其是否能得一調和之方策又屬疑問。吾人廻溯過去英荷間橡皮生産限制協議之失敗。而銀之生産之普遍。又遠在橡皮之上。或可見限制方案之無從制定矣</p>
<p>以上云云。不過表明銀問題解决之不易。使國人勿過作無謂之夢想。至於提高銀價與吾國經濟之影響。則非在本文討論之範圍。</p>

<p>香港隊全取攻勢　　上海隊先勝後敗全部戰局之形勢香港隊處處佔優開塲之二十分鐘中、香港隊進攻、上海鬥前險象時見、而上海隊之進攻則時露弱點、緩慢而生疏不熟、鄭少康最先頂中一球輝許罰中十二碼繼之軋許又中一球、上海隊以二比一居先、不二分鐘鄭少康又中一球港隊二比二平手上半時將終結陳鎭和又中一球上半時上海以三比二佔先不料下半時上海因戰將傷者累累、陣線零亂紛碎遂爲香港射中二次、四比三反歸失敗、下半時幾全爲香港之局面</p>

<p>丨香港隊上場之聲色丨</p>
<p>鼓掌雷動中兩隊登塲、上海隊開球經派多之一阻而退回、巴德萊隨球而進史篤克之失足、開塲卽幾成禍種風波繼之時起時落香港前鋒之鋭利猛勇二十分鐘中、已可領略一斑、上海隊之進攻巴爾敦得後方來球向前衝進、直達門前、與推納二人、皆失之未中、陳家球左右盤旋、殊見威風但持之過久、爲卑利士一截而去、若此機會、徒令人爲上海嘆惜、</p>
<p>丨鄭少康妙頂第一功丨香港舉以回攻、鄭少康角球一頂、落點殊佳、幾乎中的派多在半塲踏任意球、直向球門猛射、周賢言撲之而出全場哇然、驚風險濤之中、果然生不測之禍巴德萊得一角球球將飛落、右翼鄭少康奇兵突出、看準來球、在此一刹那間、一頂而中香港遂先唱凱歌、時開塲已二十分鐘</p>
<p>丨十二碼上海回一球丨香港勝一球之後五分鐘、鮑爾敦得黑炭自右來球機會甚佳舉足過遲、守門有備而撲出球再落黑炭之前、推納提起射擊、港方中堅派多欲阻香港埠際隊李尊庸攝</p>
<p>禦而不料於此罰球區域之内、球觸手中、下令判罰二十碼軋許趕上踢之而入港滬乃各勝一球、徐亞輝則轉瞬受傷、</p>
<p>丨驚險無窮之上海隊丨</p>
<p>不分勝負進攻退守雙方互相、巴德萊在左翼直射球門周賢言露現恐慌、幾乎失守、孫鍾順忽起一球、黄美順再送巴德萊、巴再併力以射、周賢言急救而出、才顯鐵門之妙技孫錦順得巴德萊之球、史篤克大意失着、幸赫雷見危趕來、一脚救駕、甚矣上海隊之驚險、</p>
<p>丨否極泰來上海居先丨</p>
<p>險極泰來巴爾敦撥送凱芝、凱芝踏定射送、自右直飛左角、黑炭乘勢射得、造成角球、黑炭之不偏不倚之落點、成爲門前之爭奪軋許乘勢之蹴、巴爾敦冷眼以觀、向後一送、飛滾門内而去、上海失一球連得二球遂以二比一居先、</p>
<p>丨鄭少康二次奏妙功丨</p>
<p>一波方起一波又來、形勢變化之迅速無窮、此第三球勝後之二分鐘、香港以迅雷不及掩耳之戰術孫錦順飛送鄭少康、自右角而左角亦飛射與巴德萊李寗史篤克顧左失右、而巴又飛達右角矣、少康射之而入、其左右傳送之敏速、眞有無窮之美妙、</p>
<p>丨失交臂巴爾敦請客丨</p>
<p>上海隊再以回攻、巴爾敦傳黑炭黑炭亦不亞巴德萊直飛右角、凱芝送中央門前空洞無人、僅餘羅渣苦守、正束手待縛天助其人、巴爾敦趕來、可不費力氣而射入竟稍一遲疑、遂失之交臂、過門而不入、故謂巴爾敦請客亦可、</p>
<p>丨小黑炭偷襲破港軍丨</p>
<p>失之東隅收之桑　、巴爾敦雖錯過機會、凱芝沿右邊而進、卑利士蹴之出界、赫雷擲人、球家舉以傳與推納、推向左撥陳鎭和在無人監視之中飛起中的、上海隊又以三比二勝、</p>
<p>丨無獨有偶葫蘆依樣丨</p>
<p>二離上半時終結之五分鐘中、港中鋒霍威在門前對門正射周賢言之妙救、大受讚好、巴德萊在左得之而傳右李寗史篤克竟同時失足、黄美順對門猛射、砰然一聲鐵門倒地幸仍擲出、巴德萊大可獨打空門竟遠飛野球以去、與巴爾敦、無獨有偶上半時如此告畢</p>
<h3 id="c115">下半時情形 <a href="#c115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>丨港軍迅雷不及掩耳丨</p>
<p>檸檬以休息、重整旗鼓上海隊因徐亞輝之足傷、置之於左翼、陳鎭和移入左内、推納退居亞　之職、港隊開球、事有出人意外、僅　二分鐘之中港軍大舉進兵、直達門前黄美順射入、一轟而三破鐵門、香港又成三三平手、推納則亦受傷矣、</p>
<p>香港隊奪得之埠際銀杯新聲社攝</p>
<p>丨霍威一頂天下大定丨</p>
<p>港軍之勢大盛、上海隊將傷累累、凌亂之局面暴露眼前、進攻之力全去任被港蹂躪、球之起處、全在港軍脚頭、十五分鐘無精與彩之混戰後、卒定誰家之勝負、派多射送左角巴德萊飛起傳中敵人自天外飛來出乎周鐵門之意外、霍威飛來一頂、球入網去、此第七球終定港滬之勝負、</p>
<p>丨最後掙扎歸諸泡影丨</p>
<p>上海隊成强弩之未、攻旣不能、守亦殊危、最後之十分鐘中、軋許屢屢竭全力以推進、然軍已粉碎、孤掌難鳴凱芝之角球、赫雷之任意球、爲上海最後之希望與掙扎、皆歸泡影、港隊全軍退以嚴守、夜幕將垂之中、上海隊眼看港軍奪銀杯以去、</p>
<h3 id="c116">港隊之妙技 <a href="#c116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>前鋒敏速靈活驚人中線堅强守門遜色香港隊之得勝殊非偶然球藝確實高人一等前鋒之靈活射門之準確合作之敏速處處美妙不可言、僅黄美順因不習於前鋒、時見落後鄭少康之右翼、大有曹桂成之風采、右翼巴德萊之幾次送球當居大功、此五虎令人愛而生畏中線亦堅强、後衛雖未如何出色未有大錯、所差者守門欠穏健耳、</p>
<h3 id="c117">滬隊大减色 <a href="#c117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>前鋒無攻射能力後衛呈動搖狀態上海隊之失敗、罪有所歸、堅强之後衛、竟露動搖之態周賢言入後方鎭守、李寧大爲減色、史篤克平平、徐亞輝赫雷亦未出色、徐或亦位置使然、前鋒毫無合作、巴爾敦之中鋒莫明其妙、動作之遲呆、失去機會不可計、此爲最大弱點、陳鎭和爲鄧肯監視、亦活動甚難全隊之中、毫不減色、始終如一、軋許一人而已、選擇委員、此失敗應負其責、新年滬隊赴港、必須整刷一新也</p>
<h3 id="c118">領隊之榮幸 <a href="#c118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>莫應溎談港隊戰略</p>
<p>港軍第一次由華人領隊而在滬破埠際賽紀錄莫應溎君之幸運、亦當爲勝利之一因賽後莫君謂港方上下兩局、戰法不同前局主攻右、後局主攻左、更謙謂上海之失敗實受傷太多耳、</p>

<h3 id="c177">食蛤蜊與蓄髭鬚 <a href="#c177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>中國式的排悶方法·呌做··［莫談國事·且食蛤蜊·］這是根據於南史［不知許事·且食蛤蜊·］兩句話而加以變換的</p>
<p>外國式的排悶方法·呌做··［莫談不景氣·且蓄髭鬚·］這是美國尼伯辣斯加洲最近發生的趣聞。</p>
<p>尼伯辣斯加洲是米西西比河西岸的著名繁榮都會，但是，近來籠罩着不景氣的愁雲，本州往來的人們都是攢着眉兒談那不景氣的狀况··後來，知道談也無用，只有加添着每人胸頭愁悶的重量罷了。於是，州人想出一個排悶的方法，凡是成年的男子一齊都蓄起髭來·，一蓄了髭鬚，便是貼着［莫談不景氣］的戒條·偶而違犯，便須處以罰金，罰下的欵項，悉數充作上月二十一二十二兩日的［豐年會］的經費。</p>
<p>的確，有了蓄鬚會，便排去了許多愁悶氣象，大家絕口不談不景氣，依然鼓勵他們的奮鬭精神，而回復本州過去的繁榮。倘有人問着··尊髯究竟要蓄到何日爲止呢？他們便不假思索地回答一句··直待繁榮之日再臨。這般的排悶方法·固然和我國相傳的··［莫談國事，且食蛤蜊，］有小部分相同··但是，也有大部分的不同。美國的不景氣，是一種偶然的遭逢·，今年不景氣·來年便轉變了繁榮也未可知我們的國事，大有一年不如一年的趨勢··［俟河之清·人壽幾何］要是有人詰問我們··這蛤蜊食到何時爲止？我們也是不假思索地回答一句··直待太平之日重臨。那麽，人家便要搖頭不信了··或者·冷笑着説··哼！儘你吃盡了一輩子的蛤蜊，也未　　必有重遇昇平的希望。</p>

<p>有個老笑話，説··［甲乙丙丁四人都喜歡下棋，甲乙學的是［一將相交爭］象，棋他們一見面，就佔了一個房間，下起象棋來，丙丁二人却厭象棋簏俗，走的是黑白分明的圍棋，也在甲乙隔房下起圍棋來，過了多時，甲乙倆因悔子的問題，雙方大閙，甚而至於用武，但是一聽隔房圍棋朋友聲息全無的樣子不覺面面相覷，互相告語道··究竟人家走圍棋的先生，品格高尙得多！大家一樣的下棋，偏我們閙得這般撒野比到人家那種靜穆謙冲的氣度，眞夠愧死人了，於是他倆也棄爭爲歡，相約同去參觀丙丁的圍棋，那裏曉的一進門，只見棋子散亂黑白混淆，却找不到丙丁倆，二人大爲驚異！四處一看·才發見丙丁一塊兒扭纏着，蹲在鬥後面壁角兒裏，喚之不應，推之也不動·撫着他們的身上，却都硬氷氷地，一命嗚呼了！原來他們因爲互爭一刦，憤極而至於相打，打到壁角丙扼丁喉，而丁持丙之腎囊，各拼死命，相持不下，便成了同歸於盡的結局！］</p>
<p>越是品高望重的大人先生，越會閙得性命相撲，你死我活！祇是可惜這紛紛一局，越發没有解决的希望了！</p>

<p>來了，電梯來了，更生讓那女人先踏進去，緊緊的跟進去，一個公事包，偶然碰了伊的右臂，伊把右臂一縮，飛上一個眼風，向更生一瞟，接着極輕微，極淡遠的一笑，這一笑更加添了更生的疑想的資料了。雖是爲了紅嘴唇而矜持着，可是粉頰上兩個淺淺的　圓渦，是活活顯露出愛姑的特徵來了。電梯到了最下層，遲是讓伊先走，他隨在後面見伊鑽進一輛白牌汽車裏去，嗚嗚的遠走，便放開了一切的幻想，自去幹公事。</p>
<p>這天的晚上，他又到東南飯店去找連長了，時候已在十二點鐘以後，電梯上趁客擁擠得狠，他給一個從二樓擠進來的女人，逼到電梯角裏，連呼吸都有些困難了。好容易聽見開電梯的説。［四樓］！便撥開了人叢，走出去咦又碰見了女人了，在最下層進來的，没有這女人，這女人一定就是在二樓擠進來，使我呼吸困難的那個。走過去。廻過頭來一看，更奇了，就是白天疑爲愛姑的那女人，到這個地步，不能不用一點心了，故意走得慢些，讓那女人走在前面，然後跟着走，轉了一個灣，在４３６號房間前立停了，茶房來開門，伊走進去了，砰的一聲，門兒關上了。</p>
<p>他見了連長，回了公事以後，出來走過４３６號，見門兒依舊關着，門口水牌上，寫着一個［蔣］字他便灰心了。但是到了最下層，他已死心灰復燃了，向帳房問··［四百三十六號裏住的何等樣人］？那帳房見他穿着軍服，掛着武裝带，還有公事包，不敢待慢，並且有些巴結的意思，便去翻旅客姓名簿，走來説··［來了有一個月了，似乎是蘇州人，不知道幹什麽的？你要打聽，去問茶房］。這時旁邊一個年紀狠輕的人，插嘴説·［四百三十六麽］笑了一笑，再説··［霓裳舞塲的舞女］。更生也就不再問了，倒是帳房管閒事了，問那年輕的··　　［你怎的知道？］</p>
<p>［你不看小報的麽？蔣愛麗的大名，有誰不知？］</p>
<p>［慚愧這顆亮晶晶的舞星，常在眼前閃過，怎的我不注意的呢］。</p>
<p>［我還見上海小報上登過伊一段秘史，説伊是蘇州一家大戶的下堂妾，近來又給一個蘇］州避難來的，看上了，説不定又要還到蘇州去做姨太太了。］</p>
<p>［哼！······現在的女人眞寫意，今天高興和你同居之愛，明天不高興，走我清秋大路，］　　［這倒不到全怪女人的，有許多事，實在是男人的不是。］</p>
<p>［················］</p>
<p>年輕的把頭凑過些，向帳房低聲説··［四百三十六來了。］</p>
<p>更生已没有什麽需要訪問的話了，走出帳房間，正和那女人走一個照面，那女人對他看看，却立定了。更生對伊看看，也立定了。連走出走進的人也立定了。更生先覺得不好意思，轉身走了，那女人倐的趕上來問··［先行尊姓？］</p>
<p>這突兀的問，自然狠緊張的，一壁回答伊··［敝姓劉。］一壁再向伊從頭至尾溫習了一遍，</p>
<p>然後沈着應付。</p>
<p>［府上那裏］？</p>
<p>［蘇州鄕村］。</p>
<p>［地名呌什麽］？</p>
<p>［翠微村］。</p>
<p>［嗯！······］伊急得幾乎喊出來，定了一定神，再向更生看了一個澈底，尤其注意他的胸前</p>
<p>的號布。更生也覺得了，索性完全告訴伊罷省，得常在悶葫蘆，裏或者説了以後，有新的展</p>
<p>開。····果然那女人聽見他説，名呌劉更生，估定嫌阿根的名字不好聽，纔換的。和伊自已</p>
<p>改名蔣愛麗，是一樣的意思。這時不必再狐疑了，一定是他了，所以伊就説··［我是愛姑，</p>
<p>你有事情麽？到我房間去細談，可好？］</p>

<p>— 阿羊</p>
<p>誰都説··［中國的民性很少反抗力］，要是根據了九一八事件來看，倒是很不錯的，不過事實也不能一槪抺煞，要知自有反抗的地方果然是反抗着，我們且不要談十九路軍和累苦了一年的關外義勇軍那些反抗的精神，就以本國近事來説説，已足證明了中國人反抗力的一般，</p>
<p>先前是廣東的二陳之爭，飛機蚱沉了飛鷹艦那種偉大的互相反抗的精神，嗣後就是剛才解决了的魯變的韓劉之鬥，一日間放上千響的大砲，和决死攻守的那樣剛毅氣槪，此外還有尙未調停好的川省二劉的操戈，這些都可算是犖犖大者的各具有反抗力的例證。</p>
<p>放棄了國家軍人（？）的反抗力不談，且看看民間的反抗力如何？這裏到也有着十足的例子··</p>
<p>經濟絕交不是九一八以後閙得很厲害嗎？接後還有一二八事件，人心更激昂了，這其間經濟絕交確是有着很好的效果，但協定簽字後，一部份偷裏賣買了，這已微露了反抗的能力，以是有愛國團體的警告，形式上雖曾暗藏過但底裏仍是很活動這就是進一步的反抗力，現在呢？愛國團體的力量似乎不足寒它們的膽了，索性大喊大呌的賣買起來，越發振作起它們的反抗力。你看這幾天的報紙上，不常常載着［劣貨進口激增］［來貨擁擠·······］與及［日清復航］那種消息嗎？嚴重的國難，不足喚起它們良心，愛國同志的警告不能寒它們膽，賣買我自賣買的那種不屈不撓的精神，不是已十足表現了反抗嗎？！</p>
<p>撇開了這個再來談談社會的一角，那裹的反抗力又怎樣呢？</p>
<p>禁止小便的地方，雖則寫得如何嚴厲，［如違送局决嚴辦不宥］及至於畫着烏鼈或，窮極的漫駡。而小便者却仍舊對着不客氣的放肆，放了痰孟，寫了禁止隨地吐痰，結果偏又痰孟當裝飾品，隨地唾吐着，這些，在在表示了中國民性的反抗力。</p>
<p>咦！誰曰中國民性無反抗力？</p>

<p>— 顧履霜</p>
<p>明礬爲一類化合物之總名，是一種一份金屬之硫酸鹽。及一種三　金屬之硫酸鹽所合成之複鹽因其成份不同故有鉀鋁明　，錏鋁明礬鉀銘明礬。等别普通我人所言明礬即鉀鋁明礬内含一個硫酸鉀份子，一個硫酸鋁份子及二十四個水份子。本篇所述，亦專指此普通明礬此物由一種礦物名明礬石Ａｉｕｎｉｔｅ提取，將明礬石加熱，用水提可溶部份，即得明礬結晶，全世界以羅馬及匈牙利産量最多。</p>
<p>明礬用於凈水，非特爲内地家庭中所常，用即大城巿中之自來水廠亦用此物爲第一步凈水法。請先述其凈水之化學原理，亦普通常識之一也。</p>
<p>明礬之成份已如上述。其中硫酸铝入水後，遇水中固有之炭酸或炭酸鹽類，即化合成重炭酸鋁，此物即由水解而成三氫氣化鋁，凈水作用，即基於後物之生成。</p>
<p>當三氫氣化鋁生成時先成一膠狀物，懸浮水面，漸漸結成一種膠狀之沉澱物。此沉澱物沉下時，带去水中一切微細物，如細菌泥粒等，水即清潔惟細菌不能盡去所以用礬清潔之水，尙不能生飲須再經煑沸，此吾人每易誤解，無形中受其害。</p>
<p>在醫學上用明礬作爲收歛劑，用途甚廣昔日亦用爲止瀉止血而内服··今則以外用爲多最普通者以其百份之○·五到百份之一水溶液作含嗽劑，用於扁桃脈炎（俗名乳蛾脹）甚效。或以粉末吹入鼻喉，可治鼻喉之炎症。鄕下民間以其粉末撒於手足上腐爛之瘡口不無一些理由。又明礬與醋相混有消毒退腫之效，可除一切無名腫脹。</p>
<p>醱酵粉種類甚多均以小蘇打及一種使小蘇打發生炭酸氣的物質相合而成。明礬亦能和小蘇打製成醱酵粉，名明礬醱酵粉其化學作用因過複雜，在此從略。</p>
<p>本物又能製防火布其附着於織物中之結晶體，極易溶解此溶解物可避免纖維與氣之接觸，即有避火作用。</p>
<p>明礬和醋酸作用而所得之醋酸錩溶液，可製防水布。法以布浸此溶液中，取出入蒸汽箱中，則醋酸鋁水解而生三氫氣化鋁，此物附着於纖維毛細孔間，使成不吸水性。</p>
<p>明礬爲吾人所視爲不値錢東西，誰知此不値錢東西，竟有此偉大功用，故舉一二，以供本刋讀者。</p>

<p>— 文炳</p>
<p>離開學生生活已整整一年了·有時使我由回憶而眷戀！有時則使我詛咒·痛駡！誰不是這麽説··學生是每個人的黄金時代。過的是粉紅色的安樂生活/是的。半點不錯只可惜大部份的人都把它從夢裏拖過了至少我自已是這麽感覺。而且懺悔！朋友這並不我是有意的中傷我們自家人！</p>
<p>要浪漫才是風流人物，於是雪花亂飛，風雨狂臨的時候，身上却着了一件單長衫，脚拖着睡鞋，甚至拖着奴化的廣東木屐，帽子歪戴起，縮瑟瑟地踱進課堂去，這才是學者風度，這才使人家注意，惹得女同學笑逐顔開。有時候衣服果然着得漂亮，但換下的髒衣，却竟懶得呌茶房拿去洗，一件件儘管往床底下塞久而久之，穢氣也就充滿了宿舍使人作嘔繳。了飯費有時候却不高興吃飽，反正肚皮餓了，門口頭有的是館子炒麯固好··餛飩·湯麵，也頗聨可充飢一盌兩盌把肚裏送·賬記在簿上·挾了書本轉身跳·這也就額外養活了好些小販。</p>
<p>説現化的學生不用功麽那眞有些寃枉！大便問，蹲在馬桶上的同學·幾個不手拿書本，用心地在閲讀。上紀念週或是聽學者講演，又誰不挾了書，一面在聽講一面在看他的書甚至用膳的辰光，也有拿了書本擺在桌邊，一面看··一面吃這　這些　不是用功的表現麽？天曉得！</p>
<p>敎員不好的天然是要衝跑·可是事實上却並不全以敎員的程度如何爲衝走的標準若果敎員架子辣，考試不通融不准在課堂裏看情書，話情愫，那他便要當心學生不説他的口才不好·便會指摘他編的講義不通甚至會誹謗他的人格！吊ＸＸ女同學的膀子那就糟了只好捲起被包跑是誠寃哉枉也校中有了風潮或是國家出了亂子於是大家高興極了感情一衝動理智丟開不管横來一陣瞎閙直一張匿名傳單反正有的是空閒有些便趁着這閒空機會投靠到愛人的懷裏爲東北義勇軍募捐麽爲救濟難民而演劇籌欵麽那到隨之便之可也何必忙煞快學校所定的作息時間，可以隨意更動，日出三竿，上課時間到了，却還在被窩裏鼾聲老睡；晚上電燈息後偏會點上洋燭，訓育主任來查了，便用紙罩把它遮蔽起來，問他爲什麽這樣晨昏顚倒他會答對出一大套的道理來。進學校的唯一目的，天然是上課聽講，求點生活上的智識；但事實上大部分的學生，却偏不喜歡上課，遲到早退，還是好現象有些簡直點了名就逃，有些簡直全權請人代表應到。臨考了，能隔晚抱佛脚也還算是好現象，有些簡直還在女生宿舍偎倚着愛人，或是沉醉在電影院；好在考試時，不但可以［派司］，敎員也多是識相人，詳細解題，暗示翻書也就得了。</p>
<p>這似乎説得太苛刻了，我却覺得還不過是幾椿犖犖大者。試睜開我們的眼睛看看，事實不是這樣在陳列着麽，不禁使余擲筆太息者再。</p>

<p>— 一萍</p>
<p>天色未明，宿露没脛，田間工作的農夫，再不能戀戀於溫暖的被窩，早起身預備農具，到田間去。就是看鴨的招姐，也執着一枝柳條，跟在一羣鴨子後面，連跳带跑的，唱出［私情］之類的山歌。</p>
<p>招姐春風送來的時候，已是十六歲了她每天早上把鴨子趕出來，晚上把牠們趕回去，每天的生活如此。她不知愁不知憂，鴨子在河中喜水，她躺在河畔的草地上望着青天，看那一片片的白雲，幻像什麽樣子的隨意所欲。有時和騎牛的牧童鬭棋子，涉水，她什麽事都做，而且任性的做。</p>
<p>但是今日有一種特别的情緒發生在我們招姐身上。她拖了柳條懶的跟着鴨子走春風吹拂她的鬢髮，她似乎不在意的搖了搖頭。她心中完全計算林生丨鴨子家的小主人丨對她説的話，不覺的已錯過一條河沿，她隨意的把鴨子趕下河灘。偷偷的把林生塞給她的一本書從小袋中掏出來。封面畫着一個美麗的公主。她似懂非懂的看了幾頁。好像一個王子向公主求婚等等。同林生向她説的話有些相似。驀然兩片紅雲。飛上她的兩頰尖端。她俯身見河中的倒影。自已確和公主一樣美麗［林生的話不差我不像鄕下人］。</p>
<p>她想着天上似乎幻變成熱閙的都巿像她理想中的上海。林生説上海有汽車電燈好看的女人，林生旣愛我就同他到上海去他不會欺騙我的她想到這裏不好意思再想下去。成熟的處女，應有的喜悦與恐懼，同時交熾着一個自羞的笑容。</p>
<p>陡的她的眼睛被後面伸過來的手蒙住，她感覺到被人悔辱似的駡了出來阿狗不提防天天和他鬭棋子的招姐今天會駡他的，也訕訕的走了。招姐的莫明其妙心理中得了勝利。經過了許多許多時候，招姐趕着鴨子歸去主人劉老三温柔地説招姐辛苦你了。這句每天聽慣的話，招姐在今天聽來，好像劉老三含着别種用意偷到後門會見林生耳語了好久·招姐才跳躍着回家</p>
<p>天色未明宿露没脛招姐的媽發現她的女兒這時候還没有起身駡了幾句也不見答應到柴房中找尋僅賸一床空被於是同她的老男人四出尋訪跑到劉老三家裏也不見了兒子大發雷霆老夫妻倆祇輕輕地退了出來</p>
<p>不到中午時分林生和招姐失蹤的消息已傳佈了全村</p>

<p>倘使你能夠時時刻刻留意到你每天所接觸的那你一定可以得到許多有價値的各色各樣的材料如果好好的把牠一一記下來那就成爲一本很有價値的雜感所以我覺得日記一類的文章是不可少的</p>
<p>昨天我從上海回到眞如在三號公共汽車上得到一件很値得記憶的事那時車中很是擁擠從寳山路口到太陽廟的一段路上差不多不曾好好的使我舒息過一會車又是震動得那樣利害眞把我悶得要死了行到太陽廟因爲走下了一部分的乘客車上就空了一些這時車裏却已多了一個手上提着一個東洋鹹魚的鄕下人他像很不當心似的用手指拉着那條絆在鹹魚上面的繩子任那個鹹魚往東往西地在乘客的身邊動着於是一塲不利於他的評論就開始了··</p>
<p>［你是中國人爲什麽要吃這種魚？］甲説</p>
<p>［自家的鮮魚味兒好得很你爲什麽要買這種鹹魚？］乙説</p>
<p>［不吃這種魚也不見得難過日子吧！］丙説</p>
<p>［咱們中國人實在太不爭氣所以國家弄得這個樣子··做官的只知括地皮做生意的只知販賣仇貨括地皮的我們現在固然要不得他怎樣販仇貨的祗要我們不去買他就要吃虧·······］丁説</p>
<p>這樣你一句我一句結果把那位鄕下人説得面紅耳赤了他靜默着一聲也不響他像感到十分慚愧似的在懊悔着。</p>
<p>這時我心裏却覺得很有些奇怪在那幾位穿小工衣服的小國民口中竟會發出這樣富有民族性的談話誰説中國不可救充滿了民族意識的民衆是占有中國四萬萬人中的大多數呢如果統治階級能夠好好的去利用民衆以民衆的力量來對付敵人的侵略那也不是一個不好的辦法吧</p>
<p>車到顧家宅那個手上提着一個洋魚的鄕下人下車了車裏的人們都旋轉頭來看那位鄕下人的背影汽車不停地向前進行那位鄕下人的背影也即隨着消失了</p>

<p>這次車駛至西藏路的時候馬路上忽然有一陣雄壯嘹亮的軍樂和歌唱車廂裏就起了一點點浮動車停了··人頭都伸出車窗移着驚奇而嚴肅的目光探望着矮子扯住我的衣袖喊我快看等我從人堆裏擠到窗沿的時候車已行動了我只發現一隊人馬的背影向北泥城橋走着原來是美國的少爺兵迫擊砲隊挺肚皮的大個子抓住了這點材料就開始發表議論了丨丨</p>
<p>［花旗兵多威武軍容多整齊丨我説過那些不識時務的年青學生天天高喊着要和帝國主義打仗你想那些比呌化子還不如的中國兵能和這些神武威嚴的洋兵打仗嗎？哈哈·····眞是笑話·····］</p>
<p>［若是眞的打起來］矮子很自然地隨和着［只要中國兵望着了這些洋兵的影兒怕都要駭得跑呢丨你聽他們嘴吧裏唱的軍歌聽了毛髮都根根的豎起來了多呌人起嚴肅和恐怖之心呀···丨］</p>

<p>— 郭伯良</p>
<p>急驚屬熱慢驚屬寒未滿週歲之小兒。保養最爲難能。設哺乳無定之時間。以致飽餓不一。或過於愛惜。常常逗引取樂或過於温暖此等事皆能造成驚風之危症蓋小兒純陽之體。臓腑未充氣血未足。一經受病。無論外感内病必傷其津液。</p>
<p>若感受風邪身熱不退而現哭泣無涙。面青鼻乾等現象。内部津液已傷。驚風將起發作之狀。壯熱面赤。神志糢糊手足牽動。背骨反張。兩目直視。牙關緊閉。痰升氣急此類驚風謂之急驚。</p>
<p>若無寒熱忽然背骨反張四肢搐搦。大便現青白色痰湧氣急唇口歪斜此類驚風謂之慢驚</p>
<p>亦有急驚慢驚同時來者然必須觀其急慢驚症狀之多少。然後加以肯定是熱症抑係寒症。大凡急驚屬熱慢驚屬寒急驚多由於肝熱慢驚多由於脾寒急驚之治法。當以清熱化痰熄風生津爲主慢驚之治法。當以溫運和中化痰爲主。故見小兒有病。毌庸驚慌。先審察其是寒。抑熱。然後延醫診治。切勿妄信巫祝。奈舉世父母。一見小兒患驚。莫不驚慌失措。刹而巫祝。刹而仙方百。法雜陳。以致小兒不救良可悲也。</p>

<p>諺曰瘡無大小出膿就好此以局部之外科而言若瘰癧症。未破潰者。猶可冀其消散已破潰出膿。而欲望其痊愈者。則未之多見。須知瘰癧一症。係全身病。不能因僅見項頸結核無所痛苦。即武斷爲局部外科也。不明醫藥常識者。多以爲局部小恙。不足介意。每用歐法挖。去或用騐方吊丹。是以恒見瘰癧雖去而本身之蘊毒未盡。仍舊復發。以致殞命戕生者。比比皆是。本刋爲社會謀幸福不得不詳爲告訴。</p>
<p>頸項一部爲淋巴　叢集之所。淋巴腺之功能專以殲滅痛菌先天遺傳之癆瘵與梅毒因血統之關係蘊於全身。淋巴腺失其滅菌之能力反而結核腫脹者。爲之瘰癧素問稱瘰癧的謂鼠瘻。後世之方書以爲瘰癧係癧係由誤食鼠嚙</p>
<p>不潔之物。實爲臆度之言。蓋素問之爲鼠瘻指破潰者而言。靈樞曰已潰者爲瘻未潰者爲瘰癧此症見於少壯者爲多老年者少考其因總不外爲父母之遺毒也。</p>
<p>瘰癧初起。結核如豆大或如桃核如栗子纍纍四五粒多則連接耳根。及於缺盆或自左至右。或自右至左。瘰癧之輕者撮而推之。能上下左右。轉運自如日積月累漸漸增大推之不移至半年或一二年。則破潰出膿。其破潰之先必軟而色澤不變。或有微痛。但不痛爲多。由於先天癆瘵者。膿水清稀涓滴不絕。由於遺傳梅毒者。膿水渾濁而厚。且有臭味。</p>
<p>以上所言。爲眞性之瘰癧又有一種假性之瘰癧。如咽喉病咳嗽小兒痘瘡。痧痲其本病雖治愈而項頸及頷下。往往結核如瘰癧。反久不消散者不可誤爲瘰癧。蓋病後正氣未復蘊毒未盡。待其體質充强。自能消散也遷延日久者。亦須延醫診治以。免誘起種疾病。</p>
<p>瘰癧一症。有易愈者有難愈者有雖治而無效者。此等問題。最爲患者關心欲。解决此問題。不難。祇要明瞭其眞</p>

<h3 id="e2">Japan No Longer Insists on Opposing Transfer <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>The League of Nations Administrative Council adjourned on the 26th, but representatives from various countries will still hold secret meetings. After reconvening next Monday, the Lytton Report and the entire case will be submitted to a special assembly for discussion. The League of Nations Assembly resolved on March 11th of this year to request the Administrative Council to submit all documents and attachments concerning the Sino-Japanese issue that should be submitted to the Assembly to the committee. Therefore, it is expected that when the Administrative Council meeting transfers the entire case next week, it will first be sent back to the Committee of Nineteen. The Japanese representative has already requested instructions from the Japanese government regarding the transfer issue. Japan, in view of the Administrative Council's opinions trending towards unanimity, no longer insists on opposition.</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, it is too early to predict the trend and development of the Sino-Japanese issue, but several events close to the League of Nations are worth recording. It is said that the League of Nations Assembly will eventually establish a resolution based on U.S. Secretary of State Stimson's declaration, refusing to recognize (Manchukuo) and directly or indirectly criticizing Japan's recognition of the state. Before taking this step, the League of Nations Assembly will demand China provide guarantees for the international supervision of Japanese interests within the three northeastern provinces. If this plan is realized, the supervisory duties will be carried out by an international civilian and military commission, which will determine when this guarantee has been sufficiently fulfilled and when Japanese troops can be withdrawn. The above method is still uncertain, but those who support China's position can see the outline of how it might work. The President of the League of Nations Assembly and Chairman of the Committee of Nineteen, Mr. Hymans, will arrive in Geneva on Thursday. It is now heard that the procedure to be adopted by the League of Nations is for the Administrative Council to submit the issue to the Committee of Nineteen, and then the committee will formally convene to decide the date of the assembly. It is generally believed that the date of the assembly will be in the first half of the week after next. At that time, the assembly may first pass the chapters of the Lytton Report detailing the facts, and then hand over the research on the conclusions in the report and the Assembly's recommendations to the Committee of Nineteen for handling. The real showdown will erupt at that time. Public opinion in Germany seems to be influenced by the Japanese claim that the situation in Manchuria is different from anywhere else in the world, and therefore ordinary ready-made rules do not apply. Therefore, the Germans believe that direct negotiations are more beneficial than legal judgments by the League of Nations. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Contents of Japanese Government's Instruction to Matsuoka <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Do not insist on opposing participation in the Assembly, but reservations must be clearly recorded. Prepare to firmly vote against any resolution that is detrimental to Japan.</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently received a telegram from the delegation in Geneva requesting instructions, stating that the Japanese representative, because the League of Nations intended to submit the report and opinions to the Assembly for deliberation, declared in the Council seat that he would request instructions from his home government. The Chairman requested a time to express acceptance of the instructions, but no specific time was mentioned. Please send instructions immediately. (United Press, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs held a meeting at 10:00 this morning and decided on the content of the instruction telegram as follows: 1. Regarding Chairman Valera's proposal to submit the Sino-Japanese dispute to the Assembly for deliberation, Japan has opposed resolving the Manchurian case under Article 15 of the Covenant since the Assembly this spring, and this reservation cannot be changed. However, if the Assembly is opened on procedural issues, it is not necessary to insist on opposition. 2. If an Assembly is to be opened, the records of the arguments since the 21st must be transferred to the Assembly. If the Administrative Council wants to add opinions to submit to the Assembly, the delegation must request instructions again. 3. When the Administrative Council transfers the matter to the Assembly for discussion, the Japanese reservations must be clearly recorded, and the record must be sent to the Assembly together. (China United Press, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated today that the Japanese government has issued instructions to the Japanese delegation in Geneva that if the Sino-Japanese issue is transferred to the special assembly by the League of Nations Administrative Council, the Japanese representative may participate in the meeting, but will oppose invoking Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant to resolve the dispute. Japan still insists on handling the case in accordance with Article 11 of the League of Nations Covenant. Japan believes that the Administrative Council should discuss the Lytton Report more closely, but the directors have not indicated any such inclination. Japan does not want to give up its right to vote this time, but will vote against any unacceptable resolution proposed by the special assembly. Japan believes that any resolution passed by a special assembly convened under Article 11 of the League of Nations Covenant must be unanimously agreed upon to be effective. He also said that if necessary, Japan is prepared to participate in the meetings of the Committee of Nineteen, but on the condition that Japan not be regarded as a defendant in court.

<h3 id="e4">Fourth Day of Administrative Council Meeting <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) The prominent development of today's meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council was the proposal to submit the Sino-Japanese issue to a special session of the League of Nations Assembly. Dr. Wellington Koo immediately accepted the proposal on behalf of China, while the Japanese representative wanted to consult his home government. After the Japanese representative read his written statement, it was registered by the Administrative Council, and then Sir Lytton was invited to sit on the Administrative Council.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Chairman Valera Makes Important Remarks <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Valera made important remarks, asking both parties to seriously consider what they can do to help the League of Nations, saying that since both China and Japan have stated their opinions, the question now is whether the Administrative Council can wait a little longer before submitting the matter to a special session of the Assembly in accordance with the application in the League of Nations Assembly resolution of March 11, 1932. The Administrative Council, according to the resolution of February 19, had submitted the Sino-Japanese dispute to the League of Nations Assembly in accordance with Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant. Therefore, the Assembly has accepted the matter and is now directly responsible for seeking a solution. Submitting this matter to the Assembly does not diminish the inherent rights of the Administrative Council. The Administrative Council can still freely decide on the discussion of the report in accordance with another article of the League of Nations Covenant, but he believes that the method decided by the Administrative Council after hearing the opinions of both parties not to initiate another discussion is fully in line with the resolution of the Administrative Council on February 19 to submit the matter to the Assembly. He knows that the general intention is for the special session of the Assembly to re-discuss the matter as soon as possible. The directors of the Administrative Council, who are also members of the Assembly, will have full opportunity to participate in the Assembly discussion, and their opinions will be expressed more appropriately in the Assembly. When he and his colleagues listened to the speeches of the Chinese and Japanese representatives, they all wanted to find in their speeches the basis for a satisfactory and rapid solution to this dispute, but what they heard was probably rarely satisfying to the expectations of their colleagues. The Japanese government did not accept the principles of the solution recommended by the investigation team in its opinion, but only acknowledged the phrase [merely restoring the original state is not a solution]. The Chinese representative stated that he wanted to reserve his right to present opinions on the conditions of settlement in the future, and currently only agreed with the third principle of the ten principles recommended by the investigation team, namely [any solution must be in accordance with the provisions of the League of Nations Covenant, the Paris Convention, and the Nine-Power Treaty]. In this situation, there does not seem to be any degree of compromise on the Lytton Report that can serve as a basis for the Administrative Council to provide opinions and recommendations to practically help the Assembly determine its solution. He is the Chairman of the Administrative Council and feels the need to express the hope that the opinions expressed by the Chinese and Japanese representatives in the Administrative Council in recent days are not the final opinions representing their respective governments. Any solution that has the possibility of fairly and permanently resolving this unfortunate dispute will not be rejected by both parties. What he is saying now not only represents the Administrative Council, but also represents the public opinion of most of the world. If the League of Nations organization, which is a peaceful resolution of disputes, cannot actively use effectiveness in the dispute involving two important member states of the League of Nations such as China and Japan, or its use is hindered by the lack of necessary cooperation from any party, it will be an intolerable resistance to public opinion. He, on behalf of the Administrative Council, sincerely requests both parties to state their opinions to the Administrative Council, shift their focus to the positive aspects of the matter, and consider what they can do to help the League of Nations seek a solution.</p>
<p>(Matsuoka still demands reconciliation) Matsuoka rose and thanked the chairman for his efforts in guiding, and expressed confidence that the Administrative Council would eventually handle the matter itself and study the recommendations contained in the Lytton Report. Matsuoka pointed out that this report should not be easily approved, and Matsuoka also said that he could not help but doubt whether the investigation team was qualified to make recommendations. Matsuoka also explained his views on disagreeing with some points of the investigation team's recommendations. Matsuoka said that Japan had proposed direct negotiations, but this proposal was not adopted, and the situation proceeded along its natural path that could no longer be reversed. In this situation, he must consult his home government, but according to his personal meaning, he felt the need to try various methods of reconciliation in accordance with Article 11 of the League of Nations Covenant. This question is extremely important, and solutions that cannot be approved by both countries can never be resolved. Japan wants peace in the Far East, but not a treaty peace. Since last year, Japan's plans have been based entirely on this proposition. Japan must carry out its policy of recognizing [Manchukuo] as the only way to maintain peace in the Far East. He reserves the right to speak later. The Chairman asked Matsuoka how long it would take to get instructions from Tokyo. Matsuoka replied that a reply could be received by noon tomorrow or at the latest on Monday.</p>
<p>Gu expresses reservation of the right to speak. Chinese representative Dr. Gu approves the suggestion to submit it to the Assembly, but he reserves the right to express his government's views on the various conditions and principles of reconciliation contained in the Lytton Report in the future, because Matsuoka has not expressed his willingness to respect the principles of reconciliation. Dr. Gu said that for this reason, it may not be helpful to disclose the Chinese government's views on other parts of the report at this time. He originally hoped that Matsuoka would at least accept the principle that any resolution contained in the report must be in accordance with the League of Nations Covenant, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Paris Convention, but Matsuoka now said that the matter must be handled on the basis of [reality] 丨that is, the recognition of Manchukuo丨, but the Chinese government absolutely opposes seeking solutions based solely on already-established facts. What the Chinese government can accept is a practical solution based on and in accordance with international treaties. Dr. Gu later declared that he approved of the suggestion that this matter be submitted to the League of Nations Assembly as soon as possible. When Matsuoka had finished speaking, he called Dr. Gu an old friend, saying that the term [reality] he used referred to various real things, of course including treaties, the League of Nations, and other special things in the world. After Matsuoka explained the time limit for his contact with the government, the Administrative Council adopted the Chairman's suggestion and agreed to adjourn until 11:00 AM on Monday. The meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>Authorize Matsuoka to use his own discretion when necessary.</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Matsuoka's struggle in the Council on the Sino-Japanese issue has not been effective. Under the deliberation, including the transfer of the agenda item to the General Assembly, the Council and the League of Nations countries do not talk about any political opening methods, and turn a deaf ear to Japan's claims, and confront the principle of non-recognition of the Manchukuo puppet organization, a head-on conflict is bound to occur. Before formally taking the procedure of notifying the withdrawal from the League of Nations, the Japanese government will instruct the representative office to withdraw from Geneva first. Regarding the handling of the worst-case contingency measures, it has given Matsuoka the chief representative the full power of discretion. (Den-tsu dispatch, 26th)</p>

<p>Rally major powers, advocate direct negotiations, the third step will propose an international committee.</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The first step in the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs' strategy for the League of Nations is to oppose opening the Assembly, and attempt a compromise in the Administrative Council, but the general situation is gone, and the Assembly has decided to open. Matsuoka then adopted the second stage strategy, saying that the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs had not received a reply, and requested further delay of the Administrative Council. During this period, it tried its best to lobby the major powers, proposed direct negotiations, and threatened to withdraw from the League of Nations, saying that once the Assembly opens, the small countries will inevitably resolve not to recognize the puppet Manchukuo organization. Japan, due to the concern of face, cannot but withdraw from the League of Nations, and pleaded with the major powers not to embarrass Japan and facilitate direct negotiations between China and Japan. For direct negotiations, neutral members can be invited to listen, but Japan has room for retreat in this condition. If China opposes direct negotiations to the end, it will immediately proceed to the third stage strategy, namely proposing an international committee, with the puppet organization participating as a condition. As for the issue of withdrawing from the League of Nations, because the domestic situation is getting worse day by day, it is feared that it cannot be realized.

<p>(Nanjing) The Capital Committee to Uphold the League of Nations Covenant issued a declaration, stating three points: 1. The solution to the September 18 Incident must maintain China's territorial integrity and sovereignty and not violate the purpose of the League of Nations Covenant. Otherwise, the Chinese government and the entire nation will never accept it. 2. In the event that the member states of the League of Nations are unable to sanction the violent Japan, our government and nation should do their best to store food and collect surplus, and prepare troops to deal with the violent Japan. 3. Our country's self-defense movement and economic severance with Japan do not violate the covenant and the purpose of peace. Therefore, our people should strictly implement economic severance with Japan and promote the concerted action of all members to act as a pioneer for effective sanctions. (Special dispatch, 26th)</p>

Now, without fighting, more than 20 counties of defense land have been obtained, and all have been taken as their own, and even Jianyuan Zizhou and other places of Deng's troops are wanted to be forcefully annexed.

<p>(Beiping) The military interest of the Liaojihei People's Support Association in Beiping, a gentleman in Beiping, recently received a telegram from Su Bingwen in Hailar on the 21st, saying that he had recently received the Qiao telegram, and that the two gentlemen, so-and-so and so-and-so, showed the public telegram for raising righteous funds. I am ashamed and embarrassed by the high-profile care, special care, and most flattering awards. I am a soldier and it is my duty to save the country. I respectfully obey the court's instructions and should defend against the invasion. As long as there is a breath left, I will vow to never give up. After vowing for more than a month, fierce battles have been fought repeatedly. The officers and soldiers are united to reject the peace talks. The enemy's will is not successful, and violence will be used. The location is remote, and the battle will be prolonged. To punish the past and prevent future troubles, it is related to the overall situation. The situation is already within the comprehensive plan of the honorable telegram. Benevolent words are profitable, and the frontier is jubilant. Not only Bingwen and his son, but also the 30 million people in the Northeast are relieved. I vow to do my best to live up to my expectations. Time is tight and the situation is urgent. I look forward to follow-up support. In addition to notifying the front-line generals and officers of the honorable telegram, I would like to express my thanks. I would like to ask you to forward a telegram to thank you in advance for the ten thousand yuan that has been remitted to Shanghai. I will report the rest later. (Special dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Su Bingwen telegraphed his father on the 21st, saying that since he swore an oath, there have been repeated fierce battles. The enemy has launched land and air weapons, although the weapons are superior, but our army officers and soldiers are brave, and the army that is brave and continues to fight has shaken the enemy's courage, calling it the Iron Army. Since the September 18 Incident in the Northeast, it has never encountered such a strong enemy. In the Battle of Kuller Station, a senior official of the enemy was killed, and four to five hundred officers and soldiers were killed or wounded. Only more than two hundred people survived. The son has decided to dedicate himself to the country and fight to the end. Now people at home and abroad praise each other, and the international atmosphere is very good. I only ask that it be beneficial to the country, and success or failure is not what I care about. The Japanese plenipotentiary flew to Russia and repeatedly telegraphed for peace, but all were ignored, which also shows the importance and importance of our army. The Shanghai residence is under the care of so-and-so and so-and-so, which can maintain life. The son is fighting for the honor and disgrace of the nation and fighting for the survival of the Northeast. It is sweet to die in the line of duty. The people of the country are wise and will not let the family have worries about freezing and starvation. It is heard that economic materials are extremely lacking, and the officers and soldiers have not received a reward for more than three months, but morale and public support are very strong. It is true that they are placed on death ground and then act. (Special dispatch, 26th)</p>

<h3 id="e32">The Silver Question and the World Economic Conference <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Arise from the Internal and External Conflicts of Interest Among Capitalist Powers. International Conferences are becoming increasingly frequent as internal and external conflicts of interest among capitalist powers become increasingly acute.  In peaceful times, one lives quietly behind closed doors. When disaster strikes, one cannot help but gather neighbors to plan a response. The same is true of the international situation. Therefore, international conferences with a myriad of titles are a clear indication of the helplessness of the statesmen of the great powers. The fact that these conferences are frequent but yield little results clearly shows that although those in power are doing their utmost to make a last stand, they may ultimately be unable to stem the tide.</p>
<p>Although there are many international conferences, they can be broadly divided into two types: universal and regional. The former, such as the past silver conference and disarmament conference, center on the major powers and treat the smaller countries as mere accessories. The latter, such as the Lausanne Conference and the Ottawa Conference, involve either a segment of the major powers or are limited to a certain imperial power and its colonies. From a broader perspective, universal international conferences, other than allowing certain celebrities to utter lofty but impractical proposals and make empty, self-deceiving declarations, are essentially useless. On the other hand, regional conferences are often able to formulate more practical plans and bring about temporary, minor changes in the economic sphere. For example, as a result of the Lausanne Conference, Britain, France, Germany, and Italy unanimously advocated to the United States to cancel war debts. As a result of the Ottawa Conference, the United States reduced its export trade by 100 million gold yuan. All these instances illustrate the plight of the capitalist powers, which are outwardly strong but inwardly weak, and are struggling to make ends meet in the face of the deepening global panic. The so-called rescue measures are merely aimed at benefiting one's neighbors and temporarily prolonging one's own survival, but the increasing conflicts and contradictions within global capitalism are accelerating its demise. Seeking a balanced solution in a universal international conference is almost impossible given the current state of affairs.</p>
<p>Following the regional Lausanne Conference and Ottawa Conference, preparations are now underway for a universal World Economic Conference. Britain, having solidified the European powers' front against the United States at the Lausanne Conference and demonstrated the unity of the British Empire and its threat to the United States at the Ottawa Conference, has gradually regained its former position of rivaling the United States. By meeting with the United States from this position at an international conference, it may be hoped that the United States will slightly change its past domineering attitude and accept the European nations' demands for the cancellation of war debts. Therefore, in the eyes of European nations, the war debt issue is originally the main agenda of the World Economic Conference. As a result, the so-called World Economic Conference is essentially nothing more than a great power's debt reliance conference.</p>
<p>US President Hoover, having seen through this hidden agenda, initially declared that the war debt issue could not be discussed. Subsequently, in his campaign speeches and recent statements, he proposed the silver issue as the main agenda of the World Economic Conference. In this regard, we must recognize that the so-called World Economic Conference cannot escape the legacy of past universal international conferences and will ultimately dissolve without results. The status of the silver issue in this conference is merely a tool for Hoover to counter the European powers' focus on war debts. It is almost the same as the Japanese's intention to raise the issue of racial equality at the Washington Conference. Since the speaker's real intention is not wine, its futility is already evident.</p>
<p>However, the silver issue must be discussed at least once in the upcoming World Economic Conference because its history and its position in public opinion make it an unavoidable fact. The solution to the silver issue comes down to two options: limiting production or increasing its usage. Increasing its usage is mainly focused on restoring silver coinage. On this point, there is already a wonderful argument in American public opinion: "If silver is cheap, must we use silver for coinage? If cotton is cheap, must we also use cotton for coinage?" Since the authority of the theory of controlled currency has long surpassed the theory of international bimetallism after European countries abandoned the gold standard, the restoration of silver coinage has become a relic of the past. The discussion will undoubtedly center on limiting production.</p>
<p>Limiting production will again lead to conflict. The world's largest silver-producing countries, the United States and Mexico, will undoubtedly attribute the drastic decline in silver prices to India's sale of its silver reserves, while Britain, the protector of India, will certainly deny this and advocate for restrictions on silver mine production. Since both sides have their own reasons, it is doubtful whether a conciliatory solution can be found. Recalling the failure of the past British-Dutch rubber production restriction agreement, and considering that the production of silver is even more widespread than that of rubber, one can see that a restrictive plan will be difficult to formulate.</p>
<p>The above is merely to illustrate the difficulty of resolving the silver issue and to prevent the people of our country from entertaining unnecessary illusions. As for the impact of raising silver prices on our country's economy, it is beyond the scope of this article.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 25th - Talks regarding Germany's demand for military equality have finally materialized into a concrete plan. A meeting will be held by the five major powers to discuss this matter, tentatively scheduled for December 2nd. It is reported that this plan was agreed upon during separate meetings today between German Foreign Minister Neurath, US representative Davis, and British Foreign Secretary Simon. Afterwards, Davis and Simon departed for Paris. Simon will return to London after meeting with Herriot, while Neurath will return to his country on Saturday. According to reliable sources, British Prime Minister MacDonald and French Premier Herriot will personally attend the five major power conference.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 25th - It is confirmed today that French Premier Herriot will go to Geneva on Thursday, staying for several days.

<p>Has Caused Upheaval in Political Circles and Sparked Disputes Between Britain and France</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 25th - A major upheaval has occurred in political circles here. The reason is that the United States is unwilling to suspend or postpone war debt payments. Britain then contacted France, requesting that France continue to repay its debts. However, French Premier Herriot indicated unwillingness to discuss this matter, as the French parliament would certainly not approve debt payments under the current circumstances. However, Britain, in view of France's unwillingness to repay war debts, consulted with the United States, stating that Britain was willing to deduct France's debt to Britain from Britain's debt to the United States and repay the remaining amount. Therefore, under this plan, Britain would only need to pay the United States $54 million. French public opinion is extremely indignant about this, considering it an attempt to shift the blame onto France and undermine the united European front. The French government has not yet made a formal statement on this matter, but it has acknowledged its significance.</p>
<h3 id="e67">US Reply: Cannot Abandon Original Agreement <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 25th - President Hoover's reply to the British government's request for a moratorium on the £28 million debt due on December 15th was released today. The main points of the reply are as follows: In such an important matter, there must be no opportunity for misunderstanding or for the two countries to fail to reach a satisfactory solution. Congress has the final decision-making power. Reparations are a purely European issue that has nothing to do with the United States. The British dispatch of November 10th should not imply that the Lausanne reparations issue was resolved because of reliance on the US government. The US is deeply aware of the impact of the cessation of reparations on creditor nations. It also recognizes that global economic depression has increased the weight of debt. However, economic depression has also increased the burden on the American people, and the impact of modifying the war debt agreement on American taxpayers cannot be ignored. A mechanism similar to the former US World War Debt Committee should be established to investigate the conflicting elements in the global situation. Hoover did not state that the original agreement must be fully maintained with the November payment. This action is more important than any current argument for suspension. With this payment, the prospect of a satisfactory resolution to the entire issue will be greatly increased.</p>
<p>Havas, London, 25th - The US Secretary of State's reply to the British note of November 10th regarding the war debt issue has been delivered to the British government. The content of the reply is roughly as follows: [Your Excellency's note of November 10th, putting forward suggestions and explaining the seriousness of the situation, is clearly understood by me in its importance. Your government states that since there is an agreement between the two countries on the war debt issue, there is a need for modification. This alone is enough to cause deep concern. In such an important situation, the various points listed in Your Excellency's note should not be overlooked, so as to avoid misunderstandings or to ensure that a conclusion satisfactory to both governments and peoples can be reached. With this in mind, I would like to briefly explain to Your Excellency how my government intends to add conditions and restrictions to the modification of this issue. According to my country, the reorganization, reduction and modification of all debts is not only entirely within the power of Parliament, but judging from past facts, the organization handling such matters is also organized by Parliament itself. For example, the Foreign Debt Committee during the Great War is an example. The committee, when necessary, may order investigations and make recommendations to Parliament on the actions it deems appropriate. Its recommendations are submitted to Parliament for review, and the right to decide is exercised by Parliament, which relies on the intermediary of the mechanism to express its actions. Your government should know that Your Excellency's general modification proposal is far broader than the methods ever considered and proposed by President Hoover and the US government. Even if Your Excellency's note is only a suggestion, it is difficult for my country's parliament to endorse it.] The US reply specifically stated, [No one can say that the solution to the German reparations issue is due to some promise made by the United States.] The US reply continued, [The countries owed by your country for reparations have taken measures in Lausanne to resolve them, and the countries have therefore given up this income, but the world panic is constantly increasing the burden, and the stagnation of international industries is also enough to increase the difficulty of trade. I have never forgotten these two points. It must be understood that the burden added to the American people by this phenomenon of decline is also very heavy.] The conclusion of the US reply is extremely clear, roughly stating, [There is nothing in Your Excellency's note to make the US Congress abandon the principles it has adhered to in the past. Therefore, the US President believes that if we want to re-examine the current financial situation, we must create a mechanism to study this issue separately for the relevant countries. The US President is prepared to request Congress to create such a mechanism to study the entirety of this issue.] The reply also stated that regarding the British request to suspend the debt due on December 15th, the US administrative agency cannot recognize it without the permission of Congress. Finally, it stated [The US government and people believe that the payment due on December 15th should be paid as scheduled in order to respect the original agreement. The US government and people attach great importance to this level, so the reasons for advocating suspension have failed to convince them. If this agreement can be implemented, it will greatly facilitate satisfactory consideration of this issue.]</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 25th - Although the US Secretary of State's reply to France regarding the war debt issue is more detailed than the reply to Britain, the views expressed and the reasons given are exactly the same.</p>
<p>Havas, Brussels, 26th - US Secretary of State Stimson's reply to Belgium regarding the request to suspend war debt payments was released here at 12:15 PM today. Its content is the same as the reply to France.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Britain and France Greatly Disappointed, French Public Opinion Particularly Agitated <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Havas, Paris, 25th - The US President's rejection of the request for a moratorium on war debts has greatly disappointed political circles here. The parliamentary side believes that the reasons put forward by European countries are worthy of consideration. A Havas reporter sought opinions from members of various parties in the Chamber of Deputies, which were generally similar. The Vice-President of the Chamber of Deputies, a member of the Radical Socialist Party, said that when the Chamber of Deputies passed the Young Plan, it had made reservations, that is, France's payments to the US should be guaranteed by Germany's payment of reparations. The left-wing Republican Democratic Union member, De Monzie, said that France abandoned its claims against Germany because of Hoover's request. The left-wing Independent Party member, Ayre, said that the psychology of the Americans is increasingly incomprehensible. During the European war, the United States worked hard with European countries on the battlefield. France sacrificed the flesh and blood of its people, while the United States only supplied us with its goods. As for money, not a single cent was transported to Europe. American people have completely forgotten this fact. Ayre was quite sad when he spoke. Socialist Party member Vallon said that Hoover had relieved Germany of its burden, so that France was unable to repay its debts. Radical Party leader and chairman of the Chamber of Deputies Foreign Affairs Committee, Albert, was quite silent due to war affairs, but also said that no one believes that the payment due on December 15th will be repaid. From this, it can be seen that all the deputies believe that the US view is unfair, but everyone hopes that negotiations can still achieve a fair solution. Generally, people also believe that the difficulties experienced by the United States are also increasing day by day. Its refusal of the demands of European countries may also have unavoidable difficulties. However, if the spiritual and material capabilities of European countries are ignored, the difficulties of the United States itself and the decline of the world will be in even more serious danger.</p>
<p>National News Agency, London, 25th - Since the US Secretary of State Stimson's war debt reply was published, political and financial circles here today have lost hope of easing the war debt burden. Even if Britain pays the debt due in December, there is still hope that the US side will be able to agree to slightly ease the burden, but this is only the promise of the hopeful party, not a real promise. The US dispatch stated that the US President has no power to suspend the December payment, and that there are no facts to give to the US that can be submitted to Congress for favorable consideration. The British government and people all believe that maintaining the original agreement in December and paying the full amount in five days seems far more important than all current reasons for suspension. It is my humble opinion that paying the amount due this time can greatly increase the hope of a satisfactory resolution to the entire issue. It was then stated that the US President would recommend to Congress to establish a special agency to consider the war debt issue.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 26th - President Hoover's reply did not ease concerns in London, as the reply did not request detailed facts on the promised suspension of the British debt in December, but only expressed disregard for agreeing to the suspension. Amid the current chaotic exchange market, newspapers disagree on whether Britain has a way to repay its debt. The United States has sent the same document to France and Belgium in response to their applications for suspension of the December debt payment. It is reported that the Belgian government has stated that it is unable to repay. The French government convened a meeting immediately after receiving the US reply to discuss the matter. An audit found that the French budget was short 8.8 billion francs. If the decision is made to repay the US debt in December, the Herriot cabinet may collapse.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Britain to Draft Reply Swiftly <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 25th - The British government will send out a reply to the US President as soon as possible after a cabinet meeting on Monday. According to informed sources in London, the reasons given by Treasury experts for postponing debt payments will be extremely powerful, which can persuade US congressmen who currently oppose suspension to support President Hoover's suggestion. If it is proven that paying in cash immediately due to currency depreciation and other reasons will cause a crisis, it may not be impossible to make concessions. Today, Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain spoke in Birmingham, referring to the Lausanne Conference, saying that everyone hoped that there would be no need to reopen the issue of the Allied powers repaying war debts after that, but we never expected that we would have to pay debts, the amount of which is equivalent to an increase of one shilling per pound in income tax, and at the same time we have no income from debtor countries. This kind of situation cannot be tolerated from the perspective of justice or from the perspective of maintaining British industrial prosperity. British Prime Minister MacDonald also made remarks on the war debt issue in Leith today, saying that people with good intentions who understand the unfortunate current situation of the world, if they truly work together, if both sides put themselves in each other's shoes, he does not believe that a solution cannot be found to deal with the payment due on December 15th, to study the future of the payment, and to conclude a new agreement. The debts Britain lent to the Allied powers are almost equal to the debts Britain owes the United States. Britain has reduced what people owe it by 60%, and the amount Britain pays to the United States is 200 million pounds more than what Britain receives from Europe. Britain has not asked to cancel or reduce, but only requested to postpone the payment period. The discussion of debts between the two countries has now caused ill feelings between the two countries.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Budapest, 25th - According to the Pester Lloyd newspaper in Budapest, a triangular trade agreement will be established between Austria, Hungary, and Italy. The establishment of this trade agreement is based on the standard of facilitating mutual purchase of goods between the three countries, and it is also mutually agreed that the tariffs between the three countries should not hinder the commerce of each country. The Pester Lloyd further stated that Austria, Hungary, and Italy currently have no intention of contacting Germany and Czechoslovakia to invite them to join, because if Germany and Czechoslovakia are willing to join, it would be contrary to the original intention of the three countries to sign the agreement and damage the equilibrium between them.</p>
<p>Hindenburg to Re-appoint Papen to Form Cabinet</p>
<h3 id="e71">Cabinet Tide Increasingly Fierce, Hitler Issues Declaration to Comrades <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 25th - President Hindenburg's desire to restore a parliamentary government now seems obviously difficult to achieve, as Center Party leader Kaas has today formally replied to Hindenburg, stating that the result of his contact with various parties was a complete failure, and the President, after thanking Kaas for his efforts, stated that the restoration of such a parliamentary government was hopeless. From now on, the President will only re-appoint Papen as Prime Minister to organize a presidential cabinet, but the list of members will only be slightly changed, such as the Minister of Agriculture, the Minister of Economy, and the Minister of the Interior, all of whom will be replaced with new people, and it is heard that Brackmann, the acting administrative commissioner of Prussia, will be appointed to the new cabinet.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 25th - The acting cabinet met this afternoon to consider the situation caused by the breakdown of negotiations to form a parliamentary government. The discussion was kept strictly confidential. At that time, it was decided to reconvene in the morning and be chaired by President Hindenburg. It is expected that the President will attend to announce his decision. Today, Speaker of the Reichstag Goering announced that the Reichstag will open on December 6th, as it is to be convened no later than thirty days after the election in accordance with the Constitution.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 25th - The German political tide has not yet been resolved. After a day of meetings, the leader of the Center Party, Kaas, believed that he could not form a new cabinet, and had to report the difficulties to President Hindenburg. The Papen cabinet, which has already resigned, continues to maintain the status quo before the new cabinet is formed. President Hindenburg is now looking for party members to form a new cabinet. However, whoever comes out to form the cabinet will be attacked by the Reichstag, which will convene on December 6th. The big question at the moment is whether Hindenburg will challenge the German people and re-appoint Papen as Prime Minister. If Hindenburg does so, it will cause a political tide. In addition to Papen, Baron Neurath, the current Foreign Minister, is also said to be coming out to form a cabinet.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 26th - At present, all parties are speculating about the candidates for the new Prime Minister. Many people expect the President to re-appoint Papen to form a cabinet to complete the previous success. However, even the Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung, which has always supported Papen the most, also doubts whether Papen is willing to accept the appointment, because almost all political parties hate Papen, saying that his re-election will increase the difficulties of the new government. However, it is also said that the new government has no hope of gaining the support of the Reichstag, so it is better for Papen to be re-elected, which can achieve familiar results. Although the old cabinet itself has had disagreements on the implementation of the import quota system, even if Papen is the head of the cabinet again, it will be greatly reorganized. Other figures such as Foreign Minister Neurath, Defense Minister Schleicher, former Ambassador to Japan Solf, Leipzig Mayor Gortler, former Defense Minister Giesler, and acting Prussian administrative commissioner Brackmann all have calls for forming a cabinet.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 25th - The leader of the National Socialist Party, Hitler, issued a declaration to his comrades, roughly saying [This time I was invited back to Berlin again. Although it was said to be to jointly eliminate the cabinet tide, in fact the President and his advisers had no intention of ordering Papen to step down, causing me to be humiliated again on August 13th. If we succumb to the President's wishes, the National Socialist Party can send two party members to join the cabinet, but I have to maintain the position I should adhere to, so I made suggestions and made them known to the people, but unexpectedly they were rejected. Therefore, the President's advisers were able to get their wish. What I have to declare again today is that this system must be eliminated, otherwise Germany will be destroyed. The battle is still going on. Anyone familiar with current affairs must know who victory belongs to].</p>

<p>Havas, Paris, 26th - At a cabinet meeting this morning, Premier Herriot presented the full text of the mutual non-aggression pact and reconciliation treaty that the French and Russian governments have agreed upon, which was approved by the cabinet. This treaty is the same as the one signed by Poland and Russia. Also at today's cabinet meeting, Budget Director Polmet stated the situation of the settlement of accounts for 193 to 1932. It is said that the budget deficit totals 5.6 million francs.</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 26th - [Le Matin] published an article on the French-Russian non-aggression pact, [This pact was drafted a year ago by French Foreign Secretary Berthelot and the Russian Ambassador to France in Paris. After the conclusion of this pact, it must be signed separately by Russia and the Baltic coastal countries, Poland, and Romania, and approved of the same treaty before it is signed. This condition has now been fulfilled, but negotiations on the signing of the treaty between Romania and the Soviet Union are at a standstill. The Romanian government has repeatedly declared to the French government that Romania's special circumstances should no longer continue to hinder France's actions. Therefore, the French cabinet has made this decision.] [Le Matin] also said that after the treaty is signed, the two countries will immediately begin commercial negotiations in Paris.</p>

<h3 id="e76">Su Bingwen Refuses Japanese Pleas for Peace <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese military entrusted the Russian consulate to convey a request for a meeting, but Su did not reply. Japanese representatives find themselves in a dilemma. 丨The Su and Zhang armies construct solid defensive positions to await the enemy.丨丨The Japanese army plans to use Mongolian cavalry for a flanking attack.丨 According to a Hailar dispatch, after Su Bingwen detained eight hundred and forty Japanese residents in the Manchouli and Hailar areas, the Japanese, in an attempt to rescue their nationals, used humble words and generous gifts to plead for peace with Su, hoping to trick their nationals out and then advance towards the Xing'an Mountains. The Japanese side believes this cunning plan is foolproof. However, Su Bingwen has been meticulously planning for a year and, with his superior talent and knowledge, saw through this deceptive tactic long ago. He knew his strength was insufficient and feared he could not hold out for long, so he used the Japanese plea for peace to buffer the war. Although written messages are constantly exchanged, in reality, he is still preparing. The Japanese previously sent Xie Ke to Hulunbuir to persuade Su to surrender to the puppet state, but to no avail. This spring, Xie was captured by the Japanese in Dalian while returning to Beiping via Vladivostok. He was imprisoned in Harbin for several months and released a few days before the Manchouli Incident. He was forced to serve the puppet state in Heilongjiang, but he had long harbored ambitions of revenge. Unable to find an opportunity, he immediately refused when asked to be the representative to persuade Su, and became Su's chief of staff, assisting Zhang Dianjiu in planning the military operations in the front lines. The Japanese, seeing that the puppet representative was unreliable, had no choice but to assign Colonel Komatsubara, the chief of the Harbin Special Service Agency under the Kwantung Army, as the head of the negotiation committee, to invite Su to a meeting at Masievka on the Soviet-Russian border. They first entrusted Strotsky, the Russian consul in Harbin, to negotiate with Trunov, the Russian consul in Manchouli, to persuade Su to meet on November 12. On that day, Komatsubara, accompanied by Major Fuzaki of the Harbin Special Service Agency, Lieutenant Colonel Hashimoto of the Kwantung Army Staff, Captain Okada, Captain Miyazaki, translator Endo, Wang Jizhong, the head of the Armaments Section of the puppet state's Ministry of Military Affairs, and Shao Lin, a supervisor of the Chinese Eastern Railway, a group of fifteen people, traveled from Harbin to Qiqihar. On the morning of the 13th at 6:25 AM, they boarded two planes and flew to the Russian border, landing at Dauri. The Soviet Russians were quite wary of Japanese aircraft entering their territory, fearing they would scout out border secrets. Therefore, the Harbin consulate had informed the Japanese beforehand that aircraft entering the border should not circle in the air and should land at the designated location. In the afternoon of the 13th, when the Japanese planes arrived at Dauri, the Soviet Russian border guards suddenly held a large-scale military parade in Dauri, showcasing their military might and implying that they were well-equipped and highly trained. After Komatsubara and others disembarked, they were transported to Masievka on the border by a special Russian train, using a third-class carriage. Armed soldiers were stationed before and after the carriage, ostensibly for protection, but the Japanese were not allowed to carry weapons after getting off the train, nor were they allowed to take walks outside the station. In reality, it was the same as monitoring all their external communications. Although it appeared to be freedom, the Russians had secretly set up radio receivers nearby to intercept any messages. The Japanese experienced this situation and dared not express any complaints. When Komatsubara and others flew over Hailar, they dropped documents from the plane requesting that Su Bingwen send representatives or personally go to Masievka for a meeting. After arriving at Masievka, they sent a telegram to Manchouli requesting the dispatch of representatives, but Su did not reply. These Japanese have fallen into a dilemma. The Kwantung Army Headquarters could not help but become annoyed. On the one hand, they ordered Komatsubara to study countermeasures and promote negotiations, while on the other hand, they vigorously transported Japanese troops stationed in southern Manchuria to concentrate in the Ang'angxi area to create a show of support. However, Su Bingwen had already made full military arrangements. He recently informed the Russian consul in Manchouli that he refused to send representatives for negotiations. The Russian consul telegraphed its Foreign Affairs Committee, which relayed it to the Japanese. Although the Japanese knew that negotiations were hopeless, they were still trying hard to collect information on people related to Su Bingwen, persuading Su to release the nationals and surrender to the puppet state. Ji Xiang, the former chairman of the Heilongjiang puppet Security Maintenance Association, who was acquainted with Su, was also used by the Japanese to send telegrams to persuade him. Currently, the Su and Zhang armies, after a fierce battle with the Japanese army at Qianhou Kuler on November 10, Wu Delin's brigade rushed to the front lines from Manchouli to reinforce.</p>
<p>They are now constructing a solid defensive position at Gefenshan, seven miles from Houkuler. The troops are concentrated at Nianzishan, Zhalantun, Zhujiakan. Gefenshan is eighteen miles from Zhujiakan, Nianzishan is sixty miles from Zhujiakan, and Zhalantun is sixty miles from Nianzishan. The troop deployment is extremely secret, and all have built solid trenches. The Japanese army and the puppet cavalry brigade are guarding the area around Hulhuyu and Yaokuler, with the two sides' positions very close. However, the Japanese army must wait for its Sixth Division to arrive before launching an offensive. Recently, it was heard that someone offered a plan to Wu..., ordering the use of Mongolian cavalry to flank Hailar from the Solon grasslands, while the Japanese army attacked from the front along the railway. The Japanese side believes that this plan is worth adopting, so in the future, they may use Zhang Hai's army to attack nearby from the grasslands. The Japanese military plan this spring originally intended to station a brigade or so in the Xing'an Mountains to control the area and prevent Su Bingwen from acting. However, their forces were repeatedly restrained by Ma Zhanshan's and Ding Li's armies, so they were unable to send troops forward. Therefore, recently, both the Japanese government and the public have blamed the Kwantung Army Headquarters for failing to implement this plan. (November 18)</p>
<h3 id="e77">Soviet Commemoration Under Japanese Surveillance <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>An expanded celebration is held, and the director's speech contains veiled references. Russia does not treat the puppet diplomats with courtesy. The eight stations of the Chinese Eastern Railway continue to operate factories, and the Japanese can do nothing about it.</p>
<p>Changchun Dispatch: This year's anniversary of the Soviet October Revolution coincided with the fifteenth week after the establishment of the state. The celebration was held simultaneously at home and abroad on the designated day of November 7th. The Red Russians residing in the Northeast were all summoned by the Consul-General in Harbin and held the event in Harbin. Amidst the dense Japanese presence, the Russian Consul in Harbin, together with Kuzmichov, the Deputy Director of the Chinese Eastern Railway, and Rudyi, the Director of the Railway Bureau, had prepared for the expanded celebration one month in advance. All arrangements were dozens of times more detailed than previous years. All Soviet shops and agencies were decorated with lanterns and flags, and the electric lights were brilliant at night, extremely magnificent. Between the roofs of the Chinese Eastern Railway Bureau and the clubhouse, there were colorful paintings depicting the scene of the Soviet May Day military parade, with tanks, airplanes, artillery, and other powerful weapons. Viewed under the lights at night, they appeared even more imposing. All of this was unprecedented. On the day and night of the 7th, various Soviet personnel gathered at the Chinese Eastern Railway Clubhouse, the General Factory Clubhouse, the Modern Cinema, and other public places to hold celebrations. In addition to music and drama, there were speeches. Consul-General Strotsky, Deputy Director Kuzmichov, Director Rudyi, Director Bandura, and others served as chairmen of various venues, lecturing on the history of the Soviet Revolution and the success of the Five-Year Economic Plan. They also made veiled references to the Far East issue. Director Bandura, as the chairman of the Modern Cinema, gave a speech with particularly profound meaning, saying, "Everything that tempts us into danger will not succeed. But they should not think that we are standing by with our hands in our pockets, doing nothing. The Red Army is guarding the Soviet border and can be dispatched at any time. We can also help at any time." The meaning of the words was suggestive, and not empty words. On that day, the puppet police agencies, under Japanese control, took strict precautions. Each street was specially closed early, prohibiting people from passing through. However, the Soviet personnel had no other actions except for celebration and joy. The Soviet attitude towards the Japanese side is really unpredictable. The high-sounding treaty of non-aggression between Japan, Manchuria, and the Soviet Union is neither explicitly endorsed by the Soviet Union, nor is it denied. Although the puppet state's consul Huang Hongchi, stationed in Heihe, is allowed to reside there, he is not treated as a diplomat, and he is not allowed to participate in any international ceremonies. Our consul Lin Shi'en, stationed in Heihe, is still under Russian protection. Japanese propaganda that the Soviet Union has expelled him and returned him to his country is inaccurate. When the Chinese in Heihe saw that the puppet state had actually sent a consul, they were outraged and distributed leaflets demanding that the Soviet Union expel him. Although the Soviet Union has not allowed it, the puppet consul stays in the guesthouse all day and dares not take a step outside. Recently, he even telegraphed the puppet government, requesting temporary permission to return to his country. Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of the puppet state, Ohashi Tadaichi, came to Harbin to negotiate with the Russian Consul-General Strotsky, questioning why the puppet state's consul was despised. The Russian consul pleaded ignorance and said that he would reply when he received instructions from his government. As for the matter of the Jiangyun Office of the puppet state forcibly taking back the pier at the eight stations of the Chinese Eastern Railway in Harbin, the negotiations have not yet been resolved. The Chinese Eastern Railway is still setting up a field office in the vicinity of the old pier and still operating its office. The puppet state has negotiated many times and cannot do anything about it. This also proves that the Soviet Union's handling of the puppet state is purely out of cunning tactics, making it difficult for the Japanese behind the scenes to deal with. (November 9)</p>
<p>The Anglo-Russian Trade Agreement Problem - London Correspondence by Xin Sheng</p>
<p>The Conservative Party advocates abolition.</p>
<p>Samuel criticizes it.</p>
<p>丨The machinery industry is feared to suffer a major blow.丨 At a time when the international status of Soviet Russia is increasing day by day and diplomatic relations are progressing, the British government suddenly took the step of abolishing the Anglo-Russian trade agreement, and there had been no conflict between the two countries beforehand that would have changed each other's feelings. We suddenly heard on the 19th of this month that the British government had changed its policy towards Russia and decided to abolish the trade agreement after six months. The matter is indeed worthy of surprise. We cannot know the motive behind the British government's attitude. The government has not put forward any major reasons for this matter, so onlookers mostly regard it as impossible. European public opinion also has many speculations. But judging from the words of Thomas to the House of Commons, the true intention is not difficult to guess. Since the establishment of the National Cabinet, the British political power has been transferred to the hands of the Conservative Party. Recently, since Samuel, Snowden, and others withdrew, the National Cabinet has become a mere formality. In fact, it has become a Conservative government of one color. The fundamental policy of the Conservative Party is only to safeguard the interests of the special class. It does not care much about the prosperity and decline of industry, the prosperity and decline of trade, the interests of industrialists, or the number of unemployed people. Their concept of Soviet Russia is deeply dominated by traditional thinking. Therefore, it is not surprising that the Conservative Party's relationship with Russia will fundamentally change after it comes to power. The industrial sector, for the sake of its own interests, will certainly oppose it, especially the machinery manufacturing industry. At present, the leaders of the British industrial sector are strongly opposing the government's policy towards Russia. The Samuel faction of the Liberal Party is especially criticizing it. Samuel said that the government's move is actually giving a new blow to the empire's foreign trade. As a result, unemployment will increase and the crisis will become more serious. The Labour Party's opposition is needless to say. But the Conservative government turns a blind eye to this and does not care. Since the conclusion of the Anglo-Russian trade agreement, the number of British exports to Russia has increased greatly. In 1929, British exports to Russia were only 3.7 million pounds, but by 1931, it had increased to 7.1 million pounds (tea exports were not included). This year it continued to increase, with the increase in the first half of the year reaching 3.2 million pounds. Therefore, according to this trend, British exports to Russia are on the rise. Unexpectedly, the Conservative government did not pay attention to this and resolutely wanted to sever ties with Russia. It is no wonder that Samuel regarded it as a new blow. However, this is only in general. If we go on to analyze the individual sectors of British industry, the impact of this policy towards Russia is even more visible. In fact, the export of British machinery to Europe is almost entirely limited to Soviet Russia. In 1931, the export of British machine tools to Soviet Russia accounted for 75% of the total exports. Mining machinery imported into Soviet Russia accounted for 47% of the total exports. Turbines imported into Soviet Russia accounted for 78% of the total exports. Compressors accounted for 54%. It is difficult to enumerate other examples. Therefore, the market for Lancashire machinery manufacturing is mainly in Soviet Russia. Lloyd's Trade Report stated that 80% of British machinery exports must be sold to Soviet Russia, which is a fact. Therefore, the fundamental change in British policy towards Russia will undoubtedly be a blow to the British machinery manufacturing industry first. The Conservative Party has never taken into account the future of the industrial sector and has put the interests of the special class first. It is feared that it will increase the British crisis and become thorny. The Manchester Weekly Newspaper said that the British government's move was made lightly and did not take into account the interests of foreign trade. It is deeply aware of this. (October 21)</p>

<h3 id="e79">Jilin Province Volunteer Army Sheds Blood to Resist Japan <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Fu Dianchen and Luo Mingxing Repeatedly Defeat the Stubborn Enemy. The Japanese Plan to Eliminate the Volunteer Army Fails. The Brave Men on the Banks of the Songhua River Will Have Great Achievements. Tianjin Dispatch: According to a person from Changchun, since the autumn harvest in Guanwai has been completed, the green gauze curtains have fallen, and there is an endless view, which has caused the armed people who are resisting Japan and suppressing the rebels to lose their reliance. The Japanese Kwantung Army authorities have decided to implement a plan to eliminate our volunteer army in stages. The first phase that has been implemented is the encirclement and suppression of Tang Juwu and other troops in Liaodong (Japanese forces: one division and 50 aircraft). According to Japanese propaganda, this first phase of the plan has been completed. In fact, in order to avoid air raids and unnecessary sacrifices, Tang's army voluntarily abandoned Tonghua and other seven or eight counties and retreated to the deep mountains and ridges in the Mengjiang area, waiting for an opportunity to rise again. It can be said that they are temporarily lying low, but they have not yet been scattered. The second phase of the plan is to encircle and suppress the volunteer armies in the triangular area south of the Jichang Road, west of the Ji-Hai and Shen-Hai Roads, and east of the Mantetsu Railway, with the same force used in the first phase, about 15,000 men. The most powerful volunteer army in this triangular area is the Northeast National Salvation Army led by Fu Dianchen (Commander of the 7th Independent Detachment), with a total of about 30,000 men. For the past year, they have occupied Panshi, Shuangyang, and other counties, as well as key locations along the Ji-Hai Railway, repeatedly defeating the stubborn enemy. The Ji-Hai Railway has been blocked for a long time, which is the achievement of Fu Dianchen and other troops. Shuangyang County was once captured by them in the summer of this year. No less than 3,000 puppet soldiers, police, and Japanese soldiers were killed or disarmed. Fu enjoys a high reputation in the southern Jilin area. His military discipline is strict, and the local people have a good impression of him and are willing to help him. Therefore, the Japanese traitors are deeply jealous of him. They often tempt him with fame and fortune, but he has always been sternly rejected by Fu. Before the Japanese army launched the offensive, they repeatedly sent people to persuade Fu to surrender to the puppet state and promised him high positions. Fu was furious when he heard this and immediately detained and imprisoned the envoys to express his determination to resist the enemy to the death. Seeing that their plan had failed, the Japanese army sent Ogawa, Fujii, and other troops, together with Zhang Haipeng and other rebel troops, to launch a fierce attack with their aircraft, artillery, tanks, and other powerful weapons from the 11th of this month. At that time, it was snowing heavily and the weather was extremely cold. Fu Dianchen and other commanders led their troops, braving the cold and freezing, and bravely resisted the enemy's artillery fire. The enemy's artillery fire was extremely fierce, and the aircraft bombing was particularly cruel. The volunteer army lacked ammunition and felt extremely difficult, resulting in heavy casualties and a tragic sight. However, because the bloodstains of the dead were reflected in the minds of the living, morale was high and the military spirit was strengthened. Therefore, they were able to follow each other and fight bloody hand-to-hand combat. Everyone raised their arms and shouted, and the sounds of killing shook the sky. Even the fierce and stubborn enemy was frightened and intimidated. Fu, the commander, and other cadres and officers, in order to change the strategy, ordered their troops to withdraw from the railway line from Yantongshan Chalukouhe (7th Detachment Headquarters). About 4,000 men of the troops retreating from Yantongshan suddenly appeared near Huadian a few days later. Fearing that they would respond to Wang Delin's troops and attack the Jidun Railway, the Japanese side urgently increased troops from Jilin and Changchun to guard. As for those retreating from Chalukouhe, about 10,000 men, they scattered into several groups and marched towards Shaoguotun, Nianzigou, Dahuangdi, Fangniugou, Xinminbao (the above places are west of Ji-Hai and south of Ji-Chang). Changchun enemy rebels specially dispatched troops to block them, and there have been several fierce battles. Detailed situation is currently unknown, but the Japanese counter-propaganda is not credible. In addition, the volunteer armies in various places north of Ji-Chang Road, seeing that the friendly troops south of Ji-Chang Road were being besieged by the enemy, were outraged and eager to try to attack the enemy's back to support the friendly troops in the fierce battle. The first to launch the attack was the National Salvation Army 19th Independent Detachment led by Luo Mingxing. On the evening of the 17th, Luo personally led 3,000 cadres to suddenly attack Yingchengzi Station on the Ji-Chang Road from [redacted]. After three hours of bloody battle, the puppet railway garrison and the public security team were defeated and fled. Luo's army occupied the station and swept away all the ticket offices, dormitories, and various facilities. At the same time, another unit severely demolished a railway bridge between Yingchengzi and Xiajiutai, and two railway bridges between Xiajiutai and Yinmahe, and cut down more than a dozen electric poles and wires to block the Japanese army's traffic. Another unit attacked the street market in Xiajiutai. The Japanese residents living in the town scrambled to escape. A Japanese armored train from Changchun to support derailed and overturned two cars, killing and injuring more than 30 people due to the destruction of bridges on the way. Telegraph and telephone communications between Jilin and Changchun were completely cut off, and passenger and freight trains were also suspended. The puppet government was extremely shocked when it heard the news. It was not until dawn on the 18th that Luo's army voluntarily retreated, and the Japanese rebels were able to settle their frightened souls. At present, the Jilin and Changchun areas are indeed shrouded in an atmosphere of terror and tension. It is also heard that the brave men on the banks of the Songhua River, hating the Japanese rebels' brutality, are also eager to try. Soon there may be an even more magnificent and amazing performance. (November 24)</p>
<h3 id="e80">Guangdong Army Reinforces Defense of Xinfeng <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Communist bandits gather at Wangmudu, eyeing Xinfeng City. Guangxi Army plans to increase the deployment of Zhou Zuhuang's division into Jiangxi. Guangzhou Dispatch: Since Yu Hanmou, the commander of the 1st Army of Guangdong, returned to southern Jiangxi to take up defense duties, he has been carrying out the second phase of the suppression of communist bandits. Recently, he ordered the 2nd Division, led by Ye Zhao, to guard Ganzhou and closely monitor the communist bandit forces in Yudu and Xingguo. At the same time, he transferred the regiments of the 1st Division stationed in Shangyou to advance towards Yingqian and Guobu, in order to join forces with Wang Dongyuan's Hunan Army Division to suppress the remnants of Peng Dehuai's troops in western Jiangxi. Yesterday, according to reports, a large number of communist bandits suddenly gathered at Wangmudu near Xinfeng, seemingly plotting to attack Xinfeng. According to a telegram from Tao Zuode, the commander of the 3rd Air Squadron stationed in Shaozhou, aircraft have been dispatched to Xinfeng for days to scout Wangmudu, Baishi, Xingcun and other places. Red flags were found everywhere, and the communist bandits' actions seemed to be lurking during the day and coming out at night to avoid aircraft reconnaissance. The local defense army, Wang Zanbin's division, has stepped up security, and Yu Hanmou has also telegraphed the 5th Regiment of the 2nd Division, led by Li Chonggang, stationed between Nankang and Ganzhou, to quickly proceed to Xintian to establish contact with Wang's division. After receiving the order, Li's regiment telegraphed yesterday that, "My regiment received orders in the morning to proceed to Xintian to connect with the defense positions of Wang's division in Xinfeng, and we have now set out at full speed." After Li's regiment was transferred to Xintian, the defense areas left behind were filled by the 2nd Independent Brigade led by Chen Zhang. The 3rd Independent Division, led by Li Han Hun, has been ordered to advance from the areas of Jiudushui and Wujing in northern Guangdong and southern Xiong towards Sannan. As for Wang Zanbin's division, which was originally stationed in Xinfeng, in addition to intensifying the construction of fortifications and requesting the rear for additional defense materials, is deeply concerned that its forces are weak. It plans to telegraph the headquarters of the 4th Group Army of Guangxi to request the 19th Division, led by Zhou Zuhuang, stationed in Guilin, to enter Jiangxi from Guangxi in order to increase the force for suppressing the communist bandits. At the same time, the 4th Division of the Guangdong Army, led by Zhang Meixin, stationed in Longnan, has also ordered the 13th Regiment, led by Chen Jingquan, to be stationed north of Longnan to connect with the garrison in Xinfeng, and dispatched a part to advance near Anyuan, to form a line with the 8th Division of the 3rd Army stationed in eastern Jiangxi.

<p>He Jian Requests Appropriations</p>
<h3 id="e81">Dredging Dongting Lake with American Wheat Funds <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Utilizing American Wheat Loans to Dredge Dongting Lake</p>
<p>Establishing a Special Engineering Bureau</p>
<p>Changsha Communication: The central government has borrowed 450,000 tons of American wheat in two installments, valued at approximately 12 million US dollars, for the purpose of dredging rivers and undertaking water conservancy projects. The plan only established four engineering bureaus: Jianghan, Jiangxi, Jianghuai, and Jiangyun, without considering Dongting Lake, the largest water conservancy project in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. He Jian, Chairman of Hunan Province, believes that the allocation is not fair and the project is unbalanced. He specifically sent Wang Huixian, the Chief of the Dongting Lake Water Conservancy Survey Team, as a representative to Nanjing to negotiate, requesting that a portion of Dongting Lake be separately established as a special bureau to share the American wheat loans for dredging, in order to develop water conservancy in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. Representative Wang is scheduled to carry He Jian's petition to Nanjing on the 24th. The original text is recorded as follows: [Since the breaching of the Ouchi embankment in Hunan, Dongting Lake has been largely silted up. The amount of water from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River flowing into Dongting Lake accounts for nearly two-thirds, while only one-third flows directly down the old channel to the Yangtze River. With the large flow into Dongting Lake, the silt from the Sichuan River flows backward more and more, leading to a smaller lake surface. Every time the water rises in spring and summer, flooding occurs everywhere. Not only do the counties along the lake suffer greatly, but the entire Yangtze River basin is also affected by upstream breaches. Traditionally, those who discuss water conservancy invariably advocate dredging rivers and lakes simultaneously as a fundamental prevention method. However, this project is extremely large and costly, and it cannot be undertaken by a local area alone. It must rely on the central water conservancy authorities to coordinate and consider comprehensively for it to be successful. Recently, the National Government organized the National Economic Commission, which, based on the foundations of the provincial labor relief bureaus established last year, separately merged and established four engineering bureaus: Jianghan, Jiangxi, Jianghuai, and Jiangyun, to engage in river dredging projects. The funding comes from the second American wheat loan. Whether the American wheat should be borrowed or not is another issue, which will not be discussed here. However, in terms of the matter itself, since the central government has borrowed heavily to undertake national water conservancy, neglecting Dongting Lake, the most important in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, the handling of the overall water conservancy administration is unbalanced, and the allocation of people's rights and obligations is not fair. Moreover, Hunan Province originally established a labor relief bureau last year, and the first American wheat loan has already been allocated as appropriate. Later, due to special circumstances, the relief was changed to loans. This is only a slight change in the relief procedure, and the fundamental issue of water management must not be ignored. If the central government believes that the Hunan Provincial Labor Relief Bureau was abolished midway, and therefore does not allow its inclusion in this permanent engineering plan, it would inevitably abandon the fundamental and arouse people's doubts. It is earnestly requested that a portion of Dongting Lake be designated as a special bureau, ensuring that the use of national debt borne by the people of the whole country is transparently fair, and that the water conservancy projects that most people expect will not be neglected.

<h3 id="e82">Zhangjia Promotes Mongolian Banners (Continued) by Li Jianzhang <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Furthermore, regarding the Mongolian banners, the Mongols' belief in Buddhism has almost become second nature, with Lamaism as the state religion. The survival of the religion is truly related to the entire Mongolian nation. Looking north to Outer Mongolia, after the spread of communism, with a thunderous sound, they immediately opposed Lamaism, burning monasteries and killing believers. The cruelty of the methods can be said to have reached the extreme. For the sake of their own survival, the banners of Inner Mongolia have no choice but to lean towards the central government, relying on the central government as a backup to jointly defend against foreign insults in order to protect their religion and preserve their race. Moreover, from China's point of view, Mongolia is naturally a part of China. However, from the Mongolian's point of view, it can also be Mongolia for the Mongols. However, since the communist takeover of Outer Mongolia, in just a few years, the number of Russians in Kulun has increased to over 50,000, enjoying various privileges and accounting for more than a quarter of the city's population. In contrast, the number of Chinese from the mainland who traveled to Mongolia was about 30,000 ten years ago, but now there are only over 2,000. Moreover, these 2,000 or so Chinese are all those who have sworn allegiance to communism; otherwise, they are not allowed to reside there. The speed of Russian population migration is astonishing. As for Japan, since it designated Manchuria as a special interest zone, economic aggression, cultural aggression, and military aggression have all been advancing simultaneously. The number of Japanese immigrants to Manchuria has increased dramatically. If they invade further and penetrate Inner Mongolia, they will continue to dedicate to Inner Mongolia what they have dedicated to Manchuria. The gradual increase in the number of Japanese and the gradual decrease in the number of Mongolians is inevitable without consideration. Thus, religious suppression leads to the disappearance of the common faith of the Mongols. The shrinking of land leads to the shrinking of the Mongols' nomadic areas. Economic decline makes it difficult for the Mongols' material life to continue. From the Mongols' point of view, and from the perspective of the entire future of the Mongolian banners, it is truly necessary to welcome the central government to urgently send senior officials to promote civilization.</p>
<p>However, who can bear this heavy responsibility, not failing the mission from above and not being useless to border defense from below? The matter is of great importance and should be considered calmly and weighed from various angles. If the wrong person is used, even good policies may be harmful. Let's discuss the Chinese and Mongols separately.</p>
<p>If a senior official with a long-standing reputation in the central government is sent to Mongolia with a mission to proclaim the country's virtues and answer the people's expectations, but considering the officials in the capital, there is no such figure who has gained sufficient trust from the Mongols. For someone who has no deep relationship with the Mongols to rashly go to Mongolia to promote civilization to the stubborn Mongols, it would be truly difficult to achieve substantial results.</p>
<p>Since it is not appropriate for Chinese to promote civilization in Mongolian banners, then it should be sought among the Mongols. The Mongolian princes are the leaders of the Mongolian banners and are also supported by the Mongols. However, the leader of this league cannot gain the trust of the people of that league, and at the same time, the leader of that league cannot gain the trust of the people of this league. Moreover, opinions among the leagues and banners are quite deep, and disputes often arise. If the central government entrusts any leader of one league with the mission of promoting civilization, it will inevitably provoke opposition from other leagues. This will not only fail to unite them but will also promote their internal strife. It is clear that the leaders of the leagues and banners cannot bear the full mission of promoting civilization. Then who can bear this mission? The answer is only the Zhangjia Hutuktu.</p>
<p>The Zhangjia Hutuktu is the leader of the Yellow Sect in Inner Mongolia. The Yellow Sect is another name for Lamaism, which originated in the Northern Song Dynasty, in the mid-7th century BC. Sakyamuni founded Buddhism in India. During the Tang Dynasty, it entered Tibet. In the sixth year of Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang Dynasty, the monks Shantarakshita and Padmasambhava from Uddiyana in India arrived in Tibet and began to transmit the esoteric teachings, which was the beginning of Lamaism's introduction to Tibet. The so-called esoteric teachings are Lamaism. The Mongol troops entered Tibet and took Lamaism with them. Kublai Khan, the Yuan Emperor, promoted it and appointed the Tibetan Grand Lama to the Tibetan government, honoring him as the Imperial Preceptor and Dharma King, and rewarding him for spreading the teachings. At that time, the Eighth Living Buddha of the Zhangjia Hutuktu was still in his original residence in Tangke, Qinghai, Tibet. The Yuan Emperor also sent officials to Tibet to welcome him to Yanjing to compile Mongolian scriptures, promote the Yellow Sect, establish temples in Inner Mongolia, manage the seals of important places, and preach in Inner Mongolia. Later, he ordered the Zhangjia Hutuktu to manage all the monks in Inner Mongolia, receiving the golden seal and being named Imperial Preceptor, in charge of the Yellow Sect in Inner Mongolia. He also followed the special decree of the Yuan Emperor and sent him back to Tibet to advise the Dalai Lama, Panchen Lama, and Jebtsundamba Khutuktu to serve as Living Buddhas, dividing them into Front Tibet, Back Tibet, and Outer Mongolia, each as the head of the sect. This was the beginning of the four Living Buddhas jointly managing the Yellow Sect in the two Mongolias and the two Tibets. Thus, the Zhangjia Hutuktu added the two characters "narrate merit" and "add irrigation" to his title. Since then, the position of the Zhangjia Hutuktu has been particularly prominent among the four Living Buddhas, being close to the capital and assisting in many meritorious deeds. After the Yuan Dynasty fell, Emperor Chengzu of the Ming Dynasty established the capital in Yanjing. In the twelfth year of Yongle, he also sent envoys to welcome the Tenth Living Buddha of the Zhangjia Hutuktu to Yanjing, and specially named him the Grand National Master, changing his seal to an eighty-eight tael gold seal. After the Ming Dynasty was overthrown, in the early years of Emperor Shizu Shunzhi of the Qing Dynasty, he welcomed the Zhangjia Hutuktu to the capital again and ordered him to assist in military affairs. Later, because he persuaded Inner Mongolia and other places such as Erte and Qinghai to submit, he ordered him to control the Khutuktu, Hobilghan, Noyanhan, and Khenpo Pandita Lamas in Inner Mongolia, and to manage the Buddhas in Inner Mongolia and other places as the head of the Eight Great Chan Masters Khutuktu, in charge of the seals of the capital, Shengjing, Wutai Mountain in Shanxi, Rehe, and Dolon Nor, and to manage the Yellow Sect in Inner Mongolia. During the three hundred years of the Qing Dynasty, the pacification of the border largely depended on this. The contributions of the successive Zhangjia Hutuktu to the central government cannot be compared to those of the other three Living Buddhas. The so-called Mongolian banners today, apart from the six leagues and one hundred and eleven banners of Outer Mongolia, are all called Inner Mongolia and belong to the Zhangjia Hutuktu's preaching area. Therefore, the meaning of Inner Mongolia is not limited to the three provinces of Suiyuan, Rehe, and Chahar. All areas where Inner Mongolian people reside and believe in the Yellow Sect belong to it. In terms of its scope, it extends north to the Khorchin Right Front Banner, Khorchin Left Front Banner, and other banners in Heilongjiang, east to the Jerim League banners in Liaoning Province, and west to the Alxa and Ejina banners in Gansu and Xinjiang provinces, all under the jurisdiction of the Zhangjia Hutuktu. With someone with such authority to promote civilization in the Mongolian banners, it would be like a father teaching his son and a teacher instructing his younger brother. It is naturally reasonable to expect him to be competent and happy. However, while the right person has been found, the embassy still needs to be strengthened, and the embassy itself must have great power in order to achieve its due effectiveness. Otherwise, drawing cakes to satisfy hunger will not help, and a clever woman cannot cook without rice. For the present, the Embassy of Civilization should be given full power, and the scope of the organization should not be too narrow, so that it can employ more talents and send them to various parts of Inner Mongolia to spread national prestige and encourage them to sincerely submit. It should also investigate the actual situation as a basis for developing Tibet and reforming politics, and awaken their national consciousness and organize them so that they can serve as a fence for border defense. After a long period of persuasion, the feelings of both sides will be harmonious, like hands and feet to the brain, and they will share weal and woe. When the brain gives an order, the hands and feet will move. When the hands and feet encounter stimulation, they will report to the brain. With a hundred responses to a single call, they will be flexible and free. The entire Chinese nation will be molded successfully, border troubles will be permanently eliminated, and foreign insults will naturally cease. How can Zhangjia's promotion of civilization in the Mongolian banners this time be compared to an ordinary mission? Drafted on November 23, 1921, at the Military Commission.</p>

<p>The Agricultural Bank Provides Rice Pledge Loans: The autumn harvest this year is abundant, but the price of rice has fallen, and farmers have suffered considerable losses. Often, when plowing, they borrow fertilizer and rice when rice prices are high, and when they repay the borrowed rice with the current harvest, they almost have to double it. Now, for the sake of farmers, the Songjiang branch of the Agricultural Bank is setting up warehouses to mortgage rice. It has rented large houses and will open immediately. The mortgage method is to discount the market price by 30%, with a monthly interest rate of 1%.</p>

<p>Large-Scale Bandit Gang Cracked in Qianjiaqiao: In the Xin Hutang area east of Qianjiaqiao in the Fifth District, there is a farmer named Gu Shi'an (from Nanhui) who is employed at the Guangci Farm, which is set up by the Minhang Orphanage in that area. His family is extremely poor, but recently Shi'an has been spending lavishly. Every time he comes to buy things, he always has baskets full of fish and meat. Therefore, the people of the town are suspicious and secretly reported to the local Public Security Fifth Branch. At about 3:00 AM the day before yesterday (the 23rd), they, together with the chief of security, Tang Heling, went to search the house. Inside the house, they successively captured the bandits Tang Xiangsheng, Gu Xiaokang, Li A'er, Gu Youkang, Zhu A'bing, Chen Jinsheng, Li A'gen, Tao Jinshan (from Nanjing), Yin Yongcai (from Dusha), Song A'fu, Chen Xuejiu (from Haimen), Chen Daofu (Gu Shi'an's 14-year-old nephew), and Gu Shi'an, a total of 13 people. At the same time, the patrol chief, Xiong Shaozhen, found 59 pieces of stolen goods, including clothes and cloth, in the firewood pile by the river outside the grass house. After a preliminary interrogation by the director overnight, they were presented to the County Public Security Bureau yesterday for transfer to the County Government for interrogation. According to their confessions, the stolen goods were all robbed from four families, including the Wang family near Sanguantang and the Zhang family west of Nanqiao. This time, they were planning to rob a wealthy family named Mou in Qicangdun, so Tang Xiangsheng invited them to discuss it. Currently, the trial judge, Tang, has temporarily sent the criminals to the detention center for custody, and is also summoning the victims to identify their belongings.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Suzhou <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Bizarre Kidnapping Case: Xu Ganqing, a member of the Wuxian Security Committee and a native of Dongshan, lives at No. 10 Jiayu Lane in Suzhou City. Yesterday (the 26th), Xu and Jin Qingxia, a woman from Shanghai, were getting married at the Tianhexiang Auditorium on Lindun Road. Jin lives at No. 10 Wangjiazui in Shanghai and has been in Suzhou for two days. Just as the wedding ceremony was about to begin yesterday, Jin Xizhi, the woman's father, and her uncle, Zhi Zhi, suddenly reported to the Public Security Third District that the woman had been kidnapped by Xu to Suzhou, and that the woman had also taken away valuable jewelry and a 20,000 yuan passbook. They requested that the matter be investigated. The district sent detectives to Xu's home in Jiayu Lane, arrested Xu and the woman, and took them to the district for transfer to the local court. The testimonies were extremely complex and are recorded as follows: Jin Qingxia testified that she was 31 years old, a native of Suzhou, and lived at No. 73 Wangjiazui in Shanghai. She came to Suzhou from Shanghai on the 24th of this month and stayed at the New Suzhou Hotel. She has known Xu Ganqing for two years. This time, she came to Suzhou with her father, Jin Xizhi, her uncle-in-law, Cao Mengfei, her aunt, her stepmother, her cousin, Shen Junguan, and a driver, A'fu. They were scheduled to get married at the Tianhexiang Auditorium today (the 26th). However, Ganqing has already married into the Zhou family in Dongshan, which my father knows. My father also agreed to my marriage with Xu. My father gave me 3,000 yuan in silver and gold jewelry. After arriving in Suzhou, my stepmother accompanied me to buy wedding supplies. There are still over 700 yuan left. My father's claim that I secretly stole a 20,000 yuan passbook is not true. Therefore, there was no betrothal gift to save expenses. The matchmaker was Mr. Ran. Female matchmakers are not used in Dongshan customs. She categorically denied that she had eloped. Xu Ganqing testified that he was 31 years old, a native of Dongshan, lived in front of Wangya in Dongshan, and was currently a member of the Wuxian Security Committee. His marriage with Jin Qingxia was agreed upon by both parents. Getting married in Suzhou was also proposed by Jin Xizhi, the woman's father. The woman came to Suzhou with her parents and stepmother. As for my taking a wife of the same surname in Dongshan, it is to continue the Zhou family's lineage. Now that I am marrying Jin, it is to continue my own surname. According to Dongshan customs, it is not bigamy. I don't know how much stuff Jin Qingxia brought when she came to Suzhou. Jin Xizhi, the woman's father, testified that he was a native of Dongshan and lived at No. 73 Wangjiazui in Shanghai. On the 24th of this month, at 12:00 noon, he saw his daughter, Qixia, suddenly disappear. The driver, A'gen, said he saw her carrying things out. He immediately followed with his family to Suzhou and found her at the New Suzhou Hotel in Beiju. He asked her to go back, but she refused. She wanted to marry someone named Xu, which I did not agree to. I was afraid she would run away, so I used soft tactics to keep an eye on her. I called my brother, Zhi Zhi, to Suzhou and reported the case to the detective team. When she ran away this time, after checking the items in the house, in addition to the 20,000 yuan passbook, she also took out a pearl and jade bracelet, a gold ruyi, a rhinestone ring watch, etc. Details are listed in a separate loss report. Her testimony is completely a lie. She was lured out by someone named Xu. Jin Zhi Zhi, the woman's uncle, testified that he was 51 years old and in charge of wrapping in the Dongshan Tongde pawnshop. The rest of his testimony was similar to that of the woman's father. According to the testimonies, the local court, after investigation by Prosecutor Qian that night, released Xu Ganqing on bail pending further investigation. Jin Qingxia was taken back by her uncle, Zhi Zhi. They are scheduled to be summoned for further investigation on Monday.</p>

<p>Steamships Operate Between Jiading and Taicang: Transportation between Jiading and Taicang has always been inconvenient. Recently, Li Hanzhang and others jointly established the Hongxin Steamship Company and have prepared the Yuanji steamship, which is scheduled to be tested on the 27th. It will depart from Shuangfeng at 6:00 AM every day, passing through Taicang, Xixinqiao, Gelongzhen, Waigang, Jiading, Shigangmen, Malu, and Nanxiang, connecting to the Shanghai train at 12:09 PM.

<p>Robbery and Theft Case Also Recorded: Xiao Zhenjia, the head of the San Tu Township in Maojia City, a county-administered area, was suddenly visited by more than ten bandits at around 10:00 PM last night. Speaking with a Jiangbei accent, they claimed that they only wanted the head of the household and would not steal property. Xiao happened to be out on business and was spared. They robbed clothing and jewelry worth 500 yuan and fled. Also, the home of Fu Zishan, a Hakka resident of Huchuanqiao West He Di, was also robbed that night. Fu woke up from his sleep and escaped from the house. His wife, Sun, was unable to escape and was burned by the thieves with candles. The scene was unbearable. Clothing and jewelry worth about 60 yuan were stolen. The incidents were reported to the Shuangfeng Public Security Branch, which forwarded the report to the county government for investigation.</p>

<p>Thugs Send Letters Demanding Thousands of Dollars: Qian Xuefu, a resident of Yangshu in the Sixteenth District, owns a large estate and is one of the richest people in the countryside. His son, Yaliang, runs the Qinyu Silk and Cloth Store in the Beitang Coal Wharf Alley, which has been profitable for years, attracting the attention of thugs. The day before yesterday, Qian Yaliang suddenly received a threatening letter from thugs, stating that they were short of money and borrowing 1,000 yuan and that he must send it to No. 205 Zhonghua Road, Shanghai, within three days, or they would use a gun. Qian was alarmed and reported the information to the Public Security Bureau yesterday, requesting protection. Director Wu ordered detective Yin Chang Xue Furui to send detectives to secretly investigate. Robbery at Night Outside the South Gate: Qiu Qiaofu, a 55-year-old resident of Lu Qingqiao, opposite the Minfeng Silk Factory outside the South Gate of this county, has been making pottery for a living. He is married to Zhou and has three sons. The eldest son, Ronggen, is over thirty years old and has already married. The second son, Mingshan, is twenty years old and married Lanfen, the daughter of Cao Jusheng of Nanmenwan Lane Temple, just on the fifth day of the tenth lunar month of this year. The third son, Rongliang, is only seventeen years old. The family of several people lived happily. Suddenly, at about 12:00 PM yesterday (the 25th), eight or nine bandits, wearing short blue cloth shirts and resembling workers, arrived. One thief was holding a rifle, two thieves were each holding rifles, and the rest were holding axes and other weapons. They used axes to open the window of Mingshan's new house, jumped inside, opened the front door, and rushed in to loot at will. After half an hour, they fled with their loot, which included two gold rings belonging to the bride and groom, and three yuan and two jiao, for a total loss of about 100 yuan.</p>

<p>Thief Beaten to Death: Beibaoli, about three or four miles from Fushan, is a village where a farmer named Wei Fulin, who is over fifty years old, lives. He has a wife and daughter-in-law, and his family burden is heavy. He also has a fondness for alcohol. Although he has a small amount of farmland, he is always worried about not having enough to live on. The day before yesterday, due to financial difficulties, he went to the home of Su Baosheng nearby to commit theft. He was caught and beaten severely by the crowd. Wei, because of his old age and fondness for alcohol, died after being beaten. The incident was reported to the local town head, who reported it to the Public Security Bureau. The murderer, Su Baosheng, was arrested and reported to the county government. The county sent judicial secretary Ju Yundi and inspector Zhang Renbao to the village for inspection on the 25th.</p>
<p>Provincial Party Committee Comes to Changshu to Investigate Party Affairs: The county representative congress of this county was originally scheduled to be held on the 30th of this month. Some of the representatives from each district have already been elected. However, because the procedures of the congress were not in compliance, some party members filed a complaint with the province. As a result, an order was issued to stop the process. The provincial party department, having learned of the complexity of party affairs here, specially sent committee member Song Yufeng to Changshu for investigation. Song arrived in Changshu on the evening of the 24th. It is said that Song will conduct a detailed investigation, which will take three or four days to complete.</p>

<p>Kunshan Construction Bureau Chief Wu Ruoyu Escorted to the Province: Jiangsu Province Construction Department Chief Dong Xiujia previously ordered Kunshan County Chief Cheng Ruji to escort Wu Ruoyu, the former construction bureau chief who was in custody for embezzling construction mou tax, to the province for interrogation. After receiving the order, County Chief Cheng, in addition to submitting a reply, yesterday appointed the police captain Luo Qixiang to send a team to escort the criminal to the province by car and transfer him to the Construction Department for transfer to the local court for legal interrogation.</p>

<p>Restoration Party Criminals Escorted to the Province for Interrogation: County Chief Ma Zhenbang, because during the tenure of former County Chief Yang, the Restoration Party criminals Liu Xingyuan and others, who secretly gathered, made noise, gathered crowds, and prepared for riots, were escorted by Yang Qiao's first, second, and third township heads Yang Xiaoyi, Sun Bokuan, and Gao Shuncheng of the Fifth District. Gao Huasong, who was escorted by the Public Security Bureau, has not yet been tried. On the day before yesterday, he proposed a strict interrogation. According to the confessions of Zhang Riqiang, Xi Liren, and Yue Riyong, they, together with the groom Jin Yanglong, knocked and invited the Green Seed Society out. The grooms Jin Yanglong and Zhang Xingyou confessed that they were instructed by Zhang Riqiang to knock and urge people to hold meetings in each village. Gao Huasong claimed that he was a painter and did not participate. The meeting held by Liu Hanqing and others was because he reported that the township head Gao Shunyong had stolen votes in the election, and he did not know the Restoration Party. It was decided that Zhang Riqiang and the other three seemed to be ignorant vagrants, but Liu Xingyuan, although he was a groom, had a tough attitude during the interrogation and was suspected of being reactionary. Gao Huasong was ordered by Yang Zhongyi, a member of the Fifth District's Second Branch, to have the county party department send a letter to the Public Security Bureau to arrest him and take him to the county as a major Restoration Party criminal without cause. The transcripts and examination papers were recorded, and on the 24th, Gao Huasong, Liu Xingyuan, Zhang Xingyou, Jin Yanglong, Yue Riyong, Xi Liren, and Zhang Riqiang were escorted to the province.</p>

<p>Measures to Rescue the Rural Economy: Recently, the market economy in Tongru Taihaiqi, north of the Yangtze River, has been exhausted, and grain prices have fallen sharply. The rural economy is on the verge of bankruptcy. Currently, Nantong banks are consulting with Provincial Committee Member Xu Wuzhang to entrust the original pawnbrokers in the four villages to allow farmers to pawn fragmented rice. The pawnbrokers will issue pawn tickets as proof. The interest rate is set at 8%, and the term is six months. If the item is not redeemed after the deadline, it can be sold on behalf of the pawner at the market price. Any surplus will still be returned to the mortgagor upon presentation of the ticket.</p>
<p>Solution to the Su Lang Soldier Field: The Tonghai Reclamation Company encroached on 33,900 mu of Su Lang soldier field. After being punished by the Ministry of Military Affairs, the company sued the Haimen County Government, and the court ruled that the soldier field was managed by the company. The Ministry of Military Affairs submitted a request to the Executive Yuan for instructions, ordering the speedy execution of the solution approved by the National Government: 1) The Su Lang two battalions have been reclaiming the field for more than 70 years. The company is still using the original paid reclamation price as shares, which is unfair. The company should be ordered to uniformly pay the price according to the current value. The former soldier field will still belong to the company. 2) If the company is unwilling to fulfill the above method, the company's reclaimed soldier field will be taken back in full and sold separately by auction, or the original tenant will be allowed to pay the price and claim the title to end the matter. Currently, the provincial government has ordered the county government to implement it.</p>

<p>Zhou Luzhuang Robbers Injure People: Zhou Huairen, a farmer in Zhou Luzhuang, the Third District of the county, heard that bandits wanted to kidnap his son, so he temporarily sent his son to the Qi family in Zhangjiazhuang. On the evening of the day before (22nd), more than ten bandits with guns and other weapons broke into the house, tied Zhou Huairen with ropes, and burned his armpits with fire, forcing him to say where his son was. Zhou did not reveal his son's location. The bandits were unable to do anything, so they entered the bedroom and searched it empty, fired a gun, and fled. It is said that the loss was about 200 yuan.</p>

<p>Regarding the Prefectural Order to Open Sanli Han: Recently, the Nantong County Chamber of Commerce submitted a report stating that the County Cotton Industry Association and various Salt Reclamation Companies and Yarn Factories had repeatedly reported that cotton from the Yandong area was transported through Sanli Han in Taixian County. However, the entrance to the Han was blocked with wooden stakes, cutting off passage. They requested that the Taixian County Government be instructed to open it to facilitate transportation. This matter was forwarded, and the Taixian County Government was instructed to strictly comply. However, various agencies in the area have not complied with the Prefectural Order and continue to block the passage. As a result, cotton boats traveling through the area must detour an extra one or two hundred li. Furthermore, the river water in Qintong and other places is gradually drying up, making it impossible to reach even after detouring. This will not only affect the cotton industry in Tong County but also the livelihoods of farmers in Yandong and other counties. They requested that the Hai'an agencies under the jurisdiction of Taizhou be instructed to open the Han immediately to facilitate cotton transport. It is now learned that the Construction Department, upon receiving the report, has instructed this county government to comply.</p>

<h3 id="e100">Minister of Education Weng to Assume Office Tomorrow <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Will Determine New Plan after Examining Actual Situation; Expressed to Song Ziwen to Maintain Position Until End of Year. Nanjing, 26th - The new Minister of Education, Weng Wenhao, arrived in Nanjing this morning and is staying at Qian Changxi's residence. He is scheduled to assume office on the 28th.</p>
<p>Special dispatch from Beiping: Minister of Education Weng Wenhao, after repeated entreaties from Premier Song Ziwen, considered the matter and dismissed his intention to resign. Today (24th), Mr. Weng went to the China Education and Culture Foundation at 2:00 PM to bid farewell to Secretary-General Ren Hongjun. At 5:15 PM that afternoon, he took the Pingpu train to Nanjing. Those who saw him off at the station included Jiang Menglin, Wang Zhixiang, Ren Hongjun, Xu Songming, Shen Yinmo, Li Zheng, Hu Shi, Ji Qingzhuo, Wang Yi, Yu Shangchen, and Mei Yiqi, among others, totaling over forty people. Before leaving Beiping, Mr. Weng made the following remarks to reporters:</p>
<p>Weng's Remarks Before Leaving Beiping: I have repeatedly declined the position of Minister of Education, but to no avail. Premier Song (Ziwen) wants me to maintain my position at the Ministry of Education, so I can only maintain it temporarily. The duration will be until the end of December, at which time I will resign and return to Beiping. My ambition lies in studying geology; I have never left geological work in the past twenty years. Since Premier Song has allowed me to maintain my position until the Third Plenary Session, I can temporarily assume the duties of Minister of Education. The education budget is difficult, and the pending issues at Peking University have not been resolved. The education situation in the South also needs to be investigated after arriving in Nanjing. Therefore, all plans must be determined after inspecting the actual situation in Nanjing. I have no comments at this time.</p>
<p>Telegram Reply to Song Ziwen: To Premier Song Ziwen of the Nanjing Executive Yuan: I received your telegram of the 16th. For twenty years, I have never left geological work, and my previous resignation was sincere. Vice Minister Qian relayed your intentions, allowing me to maintain my position until the Third Plenary Session, which is not far off. Would frequent changes be more troublesome? If deemed necessary, I will come immediately to maintain the position temporarily, but I will resign and leave Nanjing by the end of December, regardless of whether a replacement is found. I hope you will consider this carefully. Respectfully, Weng Wenhao.</p>

<p>The Hong Kong Interport Football Team, with the momentum of defeating Shanghai, is scheduled to play against the Shanghai China Team at the China Baseball Field today at 3:00 PM. The lineup of the China Team is as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e103">China Team Lineup <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>

<p>Judging from the performance of the Hong Kong team against the Shanghai team yesterday, the bravery of their forwards, especially the two wings, is evident. Although Xu Yahui is injured, Feng, the main coach, can replace him without diminishing their strength. However, the defense is slightly inferior. The forwards are perfect, and if Chen Yutian can show his true colors, he will not be inferior to Hong Kong. It is believed that the Hong Kong team's goalkeeper and defense are slightly weaker. If the China team can defend firmly, its chances of attacking will be better than Hong Kong.</p>

<p>Hong Kong Team Takes Full Offensive; Shanghai Team Loses After Leading. In the overall situation of the game, the Hong Kong team dominated everywhere. In the first twenty minutes of the opening, the Hong Kong team attacked, and the Shanghai goal was in constant danger. The Shanghai team's attack was slow and unfamiliar. Zheng Shaokang first headed in a goal, then Xu was penalized for a handball and scored on a penalty kick. Then Ga Xu scored again, putting the Shanghai team ahead 2-1. In less than two minutes, Zheng Shaokang scored again, tying the game 2-2. As the first half was about to end, Chen Zhenhe scored again, putting Shanghai ahead 3-2. Unexpectedly, in the second half, Shanghai suffered numerous injuries, and the lineup was disorganized, allowing Hong Kong to score twice, reversing the score 4-3 and leading to defeat. The second half was almost entirely dominated by Hong Kong.</p>
<h3 id="e114">First Half Report <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Hong Kong Team's Presence on the Field</p>
<p>Applause erupted as the two teams entered the field. Shanghai kicked off, but the ball was blocked by Pai Duo and retreated. Ba De Lai followed the ball and advanced, but Shi Du Ke stumbled, almost causing a disaster at the start. Subsequently, the Hong Kong forwards' sharp and brave offensives were evident within twenty minutes. The Shanghai team's attack saw Bao Er Dun receive a pass from the rear and rush forward, reaching the goal, but he and Tu Na both missed. Chen Jiaqiu dribbled around on the left and right, showing great power, but he held the ball for too long and was intercepted by Bei Lishi. Such an opportunity made people sigh for Shanghai.</p>
<p>Zheng Shaokang's Wonderful Header for the First Goal. Hong Kong launched a counterattack, and Zheng Shaokang headed in a corner kick, which was well-placed and almost scored. Pai Duo took a free kick in the middle of the field and shot it fiercely towards the goal. Zhou Xianyan扑ed it out, causing a sensation in the audience. Amidst the dangerous waves, an unexpected disaster occurred. Ba De Lai got a corner kick, and as the ball was about to fall, Zheng Shaokang, a surprise soldier on the right wing, accurately judged the ball and headed it in at that moment. Hong Kong took the lead, twenty minutes after the opening.</p>
<p>12-Yard Penalty Allows Shanghai to Tie the Score. Five minutes after Hong Kong scored, Bao Er Dun received a ball from Hei Tan on the right. The opportunity was very good, but he lifted his foot too late. The goalkeeper was prepared and punched the ball out. The ball fell in front of Hei Tan, and Tu Na kicked it, but Hong Kong's central defender Pai Duo tried to stop it but accidentally touched the ball with his hand within the penalty area. The referee ordered a penalty kick, and Ga Xu rushed up and kicked it in. Hong Kong and Shanghai each scored a goal, and Xu Yahui was injured in an instant.</p>
<p>Endless Thrills for the Shanghai Team</p>
<p>The two sides attacked and defended, neither side having the advantage. Ba De Lai shot directly at the goal from the left wing, and Zhou Xianyan showed panic and almost lost the goal. Sun Zhongshun suddenly lifted a ball, Huang Meishun passed it to Ba De Lai again, and Ba shot with all his strength, but Zhou Xianyan urgently saved it, showing the magic of the iron gate. Sun Jinshun got the ball from Ba De Lai, Shi Du Ke was careless and made a mistake, but fortunately He Lei rushed to save the situation with a kick, revealing the thrilling nature of the Shanghai team.</p>
<p>Extreme Danger Brings Good Fortune, Shanghai Takes the Lead</p>
<p>Danger turned into good fortune. Bao Er Dun passed to Kai Zhi, Kai Zhi set his foot and sent the ball from the right straight to the left corner. Hei Tan took advantage of the situation to shoot and create a corner kick. Hei Tan's accurate landing point became a scramble in front of the goal. Ga Xu took the opportunity to kick, and Bao Er Dun watched coldly and sent the ball rolling into the goal, putting Shanghai ahead 2-1.</p>
<p>Zheng Shaokang Scores a Wonderful Second Goal</p>
<p>One wave rises, and another comes. The speed of the changing situation is endless. Two minutes after scoring the third goal, Hong Kong used lightning tactics. Sun Jinshun flew the ball to Zheng Shaokang, who shot it from the right corner to the left corner. With Ba De Lai, Li Ning, and Shi Du Ke losing sight of each other, the ball flew to the right corner again. Shaokang shot it in, and the speed of his passing was incredibly beautiful.</p>
<p>Bao Er Dun Misses an Opportunity</p>
<p>Although Bao Er Dun missed an opportunity, Kai Zhi advanced along the right side, and Bei Lishi kicked it out of bounds. He Lei threw it in, and Qiu Jia lifted it and passed it to Tu Na. Tu passed it to the left, and Chen Zhenhe flew up and scored in the absence of anyone guarding him, putting the Shanghai team ahead 3-2.</p>
<p>A Carbon Copy</p>
<p>Five minutes before the end of the first half, Hong Kong center forward Huo Wei shot straight at the goal in front of the goal, and Zhou Xianyan's wonderful save was praised. Ba De Lai got the ball on the left and passed it to the right. Li Ning and Shi Du Ke both stumbled at the same time. Huang Meishun shot fiercely at the goal, and the iron gate fell with a bang, but fortunately, it was still thrown out. Ba De Lai could have shot at an empty goal, but he flew the ball far away. Like Bao Er Dun, he missed an opportunity. Thus, it can be said that Bao Er Dun treated the audience to a miss.</p>
<p>Little Hei Tan's Sneak Attack Breaks the Hong Kong Army</p>
<p>What is lost on the east coast is gained on the west. Although Bao Er Dun missed an opportunity, Kai Zhi advanced along the right side, and Bei Lishi kicked it out of bounds. He Lei threw it in, and Qiu Jia passed it to Tu Na. Tu passed it to the left, and Chen Zhenhe flew up and scored in the absence of anyone guarding him, putting the Shanghai team ahead 3-2.</p>
<p>No Coincidence</p>
<p>Five minutes before the end of the second half, Huo Wei, the Hong Kong center forward, was directly facing the goal. Zhou Xianyan's wonderful save was highly praised. Ba De Lai received the ball on the left and passed it to the right. Li Ning and Shi Du Ke stumbled at the same time. Huang Meishun shot fiercely at the goal, and with a loud bang, the iron gate fell to the ground, but fortunately, it was still thrown out. Ba De Lai could have shot at an empty goal, but he flew the ball far away, like Bao Er Dun. The first half ended like this.</p>

<p>丨Hong Kong Troops Swift and Unforeseen丨</p>
<p>Lemon took a break to reorganize. Due to Xu Yahui's foot injury, Shanghai placed him on the left wing, Chen Zhenhe moved into the left inside, and Tui Na retreated to the Asian position. Hong Kong kicked off. Unexpectedly, within just two minutes, the Hong Kong team launched a massive offensive, reaching the front of the goal. Huang Meishun shot and scored, breaching the iron gate three times. Hong Kong tied the score at 3-3. Tui Na was also injured.</p>

<p>丨Huo Wei's Header Seals the Victory丨</p>
<p>The Hong Kong team's momentum surged. The Shanghai team's injury-riddled and chaotic situation was exposed. Their offensive power was gone, leaving them at the mercy of Hong Kong. The ball's trajectory was entirely controlled by the Hong Kong team. After fifteen minutes of dull and uninspired fighting, the victor was finally decided. Pai Duo sent a pass to the left corner. Badley flew up and crossed the ball. An enemy flew in from the sky, catching Zhou’s iron gate by surprise. Huo Wei flew in and headed the ball into the net. This seventh goal ultimately determined the victory for Hong Kong over Shanghai.</p>
<p>丨Final Struggles End in Vain丨</p>
<p>The Shanghai team became a spent force. Their offense was ineffective, and their defense was in dire straits. In the final ten minutes, Ya Xu repeatedly tried his best to advance, but the army had been shattered, and he was fighting a losing battle. Kai Zhi's corner kick and He Lei's free kick were Shanghai's last hopes and struggles, but they all came to naught. The entire Hong Kong team retreated to defend strictly. As night fell, the Shanghai team watched as the Hong Kong team took the silver cup away.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Hong Kong Team's Wonderful Skills <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The forwards are agile and surprisingly nimble, the midfield is strong, and the goalkeeper is inferior. The Hong Kong team's victory was by no means accidental. Their football skills are indeed superior. The forwards' agility, the accuracy of their shots, and the speed of their cooperation are all wonderfully indescribable. Only Huang Meishun, being unfamiliar with the forward position, was sometimes seen lagging behind Zheng Shaokang on the right wing, much like Cao Guicheng. Right winger Badley's several crosses deserve great credit. These five tigers are both loved and feared. The midfield is also strong, and although the defenders were not particularly outstanding, they did not make any major mistakes. The only shortcoming was the goalkeeper's lack of stability.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Shanghai Team Greatly Diminished <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The forwards lacked attacking and shooting ability, and the defense showed signs of wavering. The Shanghai team's failure can be attributed to certain causes. The strong defenders actually showed signs of wavering. Zhou Xianyan's defense in the rear was diminished by Li Ning. Stoke was mediocre. Xu Yahui and He Lei were also not outstanding. Xu may have been affected by his position. The forwards lacked any cooperation. Balton's center forward was inexplicably sluggish. His slow movements caused them to miss countless opportunities. This was their greatest weakness. Chen Zhenhe was watched closely by Duncan, making it difficult for him to move. Of the entire team, only Ya Xu remained consistently unyielding. The selection committee should bear the responsibility for this failure. When the Shanghai team goes to Hong Kong for the New Year, they must be completely refreshed.</p>
<h3 id="e118">The Team Leader's Honor <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Mo Yinghuan Discusses Hong Kong Team Strategy</p>
<p>This is the first time that the Hong Kong team has been led by a Chinese team leader and broken the Interport record in Shanghai. Mo Yinghuan's fortune is also considered one of the reasons for the victory. After the match, Mr. Mo said that the Hong Kong team's tactics were different in the first and second halves. The first half focused on attacking the right, and the second half focused on attacking the left. He humbly said that Shanghai's defeat was due to too many injuries.</p>

<h3 id="e119">Group B Triangular Finals <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Because Southeast lost to Chongde, the situation for the three teams is even. Southeast, Chongde, and Xiaguang will start the finals on Wednesday. 丨Two Rivers Has a Good Chance of Winning the Group A Championship丨 丨Two Rivers and Jinan Makeup Game on Tuesday丨 The Shanghai Chinese Women's Basketball Association's original schedule concluded last night. The postponed game between Two Rivers and Jinan in Group A must be held on Tuesday (the 29th). Therefore, although Two Rivers has a very good chance of winning the championship, it cannot be officially announced yet. In Group B, the Southeast B team was originally the most promising, but in last night's game, they lost to Chongde by a score of 24 to 28. As a result, the three teams of Southeast, Chongde, and Xiaguang each have four wins and one loss in five games. Since the championship is undecided, a final must be held. The schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>November 30th (Wednesday) 5:30 PM: Chongde vs. Xiaguang</p>
<p>December 2nd (Friday) 5:30 PM: Southeast vs. Xiaguang</p>
<p>December 4th (Sunday) 5:30 PM: Southeast vs. Chongde</p>
<p>In yesterday's game, Chongde was always in the lead. Southeast had bad luck with their shots, and many misses led to their defeat. In the first half, Chongde won 17-9. In the second half, Southeast made a strong effort and scored three consecutive goals, seeming to have a chance to catch up. However, Chongde was unwilling to be outdone and fought hard, making many contributions. Southeast then felt unsupported again, and as a result, Southeast lost by four points.</p>
<p>The performance between Southeast A and Jinan in Group A was very exciting. Southeast's strength is well-known. Jinan was unable to score under close surveillance and strict defense. However, the competition was very intense. In the first half, Southeast scored 11 points, and Jinan only scored 2 points. As a result, Southeast won 24-8.</p>

<p>West Qing Basketball Important Match, Hujiang Overcomes Chizhi</p>
<h3 id="e120">Result: Decisive Victory by 51 to 26 <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Hujiang was a complete team; Chizhi paled in comparison. We imagined that the match between Chizhi and Hujiang would be exciting and tense. However, last night's reality showed that Hujiang was united as one, while Chizhi remained the same. Their strategies were ineffective. Comparing the two, Hujiang won by a score of 51 to 26. Looking ahead, the distance to the first seat in West Qing is getting closer. Referee: Shu Hong; Inspector: Brandt</p>
<p>Helpless, Qian Jingyong of Hujiang broke through with a shot under close surveillance, and Wu Guolin followed with a direct entry into the center. Sun Shiqing responded with a diagonal shot from the outside, scoring three consecutive goals. Chizhi had to call a timeout to strategize, but they were still under pressure. When Hujiang scored ten points, Chizhi only made three free throws. The state of the battle can be seen from this. Afterward, Hujiang's momentum increased even further, and Chizhi was completely unable to recover. In the first half, Hujiang scored 28 points, and Chizhi scored 5 points.</p>
<p>Gradually Gaining Momentum, Chizhi Was Trapped by Suppression and Had Difficulty Penetrating. They Changed Their Strategy and Adopted Long Shots. It Was Indeed Effective. They Scored Eight Consecutive Points in Five Minutes. Hujiang Quickly Chased After Them, Engaging in Close Combat. Thus, They Took Turns Falling Behind and Forging Ahead. At One Point, Chizhi Was Ahead 12-7, but Hujiang Soon Surpassed Them Again. In the Second Half, Hujiang Scored 23 Points, and Chizhi Scored 21 Points. As a Result, Chizhi Suffered a Miserable Defeat of 26-51 Due to the Great Loss of Energy in the First Half.</p>

<h3 id="e130">Liu Chongjie Discusses Recent Diplomatic Situation <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Ultimately, the People of the Country Must Work Hard Themselves. Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Liu Chongjie Arrived in Shanghai from Beijing Yesterday Morning. A Reporter from the Huadong News Agency Interviewed Mr. Liu at the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Was Granted an Interview. When Asked About the Recent Situation of the League of Nations' Handling of the Sino-Japanese Manchurian Case, the Attitudes of Various Related Countries, and Our Country's Recent Position, Mr. Liu Answered in Detail and Reported on the Progress of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Recent Negotiations on the Sino-French Vietnam Trade Agreement and the Sino-Brazilian Trade Agreement. The Conversation Is Recorded as Follows:</p>
<p>The League of Nations Situation: We Can See Everything About the Recent Situation of the League of Nations in the Newspapers. The League of Nations Is Now Handling the Sino-Japanese Dispute and Has Decided to Hand It Over to the Nineteen-Member Committee for Discussion at a Special Assembly. Some People Believe That Japan Is Strongly Opposed to This, So They Believe That the Trend Is Beneficial to Our Side, While Others Believe That the League of Nations Is Just Delaying and Will Ultimately Produce No Results. In Fact, Such Optimistic Hopes and Pessimistic Disappointments Are Both Unhelpful. Dependence Is Not Expected, and Negativity Is Not a Good Policy. In Summary, the League of Nations' Handling of This Case Will Eventually Have a Significant Outcome, or It Will Be the Fundamental Failure of the League of Nations. Do We Not See That the League of Nations Has Declared That It Will Ultimately Maintain the League of Nations? If the League of Nations Handles the Sino-Japanese Case and Ultimately Produces No Results, Then It Will Go Back on Its Word.</p>
<p>Unity in Foreign Affairs: Now Is the Time for the League of Nations to Maintain the League of Nations. We Certainly Hope That the League of Nations Will Have a Fair Resolution, but We Must Not Rely on It. The Central Authorities Are Now Making Efforts to Foreign Affairs, and All Sectors of the Country Are Doing the Same. At This Time, the Three Representatives Yan, Gu, and Guo Are Making Great Efforts to Negotiate on the International Stage. Their Task Is Extremely Important. All Our Countrymen Should Warmly Support One Representative's Efforts to Serve the Country. If the Whole Country Is United in Foreign Affairs, Then the Victory of Diplomacy Can Be Expected. Regarding Japan's Tanaka Cabinet Memorandum, Japanese Representative Matsuoka and Our Representative Gu Had a Fierce Debate on This Matter. Representative Gu Has Already Provided Strong Evidence of Matsuoka's Own Writings and Recent Facts, and Former Minister Shi Has Also Made a Statement. In This Regard, I Believe That Everything Will Ultimately Be Proven by Facts. If Japan Denies That the Tanaka Memorandum Was Made by Japan Itself, Then Why Are Today's Actions So Consistent with the Contents?</p>
<p>International Trends: The Current International Situation Is Focused on the Dispute in the Far East. The Concerns of Various Countries About This Are Different, but the War Debt Problem Between Europe and the United States Has Also Had Repeated Twists and Turns Recently. Therefore, It May Inevitably Affect the Dispute in the Far East. However, Britain and France Have Always Been Keen on Peace and Are Powerful Members of the League of Nations. They Should Not Change Their Policies. As for the United States, Although Roosevelt Has Been Reelected as President, Observing His Recent Diplomatic Trends, He Is Also Unlikely to Change His Far Eastern Policy. In Addition, the Resumption of Relations Between the United States and Russia Was Previously Rumored to Be Possible. How Is It Progressing Now? The News Is Very Quiet. Our Country's Resumption of Relations with Russia Has Also Tended to Stagnate Recently. On the Japanese Side, Before the League of Nations General Assembly Was Held, They Attempted to Cooperate with Russia in Order to Threaten Various Countries, but They Were Also Unsuccessful. Now, World Opinion on Japan Has Gradually Become Clear, So Japan Is Quite Vocal About Withdrawing from the League of Nations. Whether This Matter Can Be Realized and What Kind of Plans Japan Will Have in the Future, We Can Ignore Them. We Only Know That We Must Cooperate with the International Community from a Position of Justice. We Only Know That Power Can Never Suppress Justice. Therefore, No Matter What, We Must Strive Together Internally and Externally at This Time.</p>
<p>Revising Trade Agreements: In Addition to Devoting Itself to Dealing with the League of Nations, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Has Also Been Working on All Government Affairs, Such as Revising the Sino-French Vietnam Trade Agreement. It Has Recently Consulted with French Minister Wei Lide Several Times. Currently, Only the Tax Items of Both Parties Are Still Under Discussion and Should Be Completed Soon. The Two Governments of China and France Approved This Trade Agreement Long Ago. The Reason Why It Has Not Been Realized Sooner Is the Tax Problem. In Addition, the Sino-Brazilian Trade Agreement Has Also Been Discussed and Has Come to a Conclusion. The Brazilian Minister Is Now Asking His Government for Instructions and Should Also Be Resolved Soon.</p>

<p>Will Use Explosives to Blast Kongling Shoals.</p>
<p>The "China Press" reports that Kongling Shoals, located 33 miles upstream from Yichang, stands tall in the middle of the river and has always been one of the Yangtze River's dangerous shoals. Every winter, when the water level drops, the river channel is only navigable on the edges, and due to the swift currents, accidents are most likely to occur. To ensure the safety of navigation on the upper reaches of the river, the National Government has established a Kongling Shoals Committee to plan for the improvement of the waterway. Preliminary surveys began a year ago, and it has been determined that the reefs of the shoals can be leveled with explosives. Now, expert Dickson has been hired to conduct a review together with Everest of the Yichang Customs River Patrol, to suggest plans to improve the waterway. Dickson set off from Shanghai yesterday morning (24th) to travel via Hankou to Yichang. The shipping industry in this port is paying close attention to this great plan of the National Government because it is of great relevance to the shipping industry.</p>

<p>Various trade associations in the city have been actively collecting funds for Northeast refugees in recent days. The City Chamber of Commerce and others have also initiated a fundraising performance. The following is a summary of yesterday's news:</p>
<p>Combined Performance for Northeast Relief</p>
<p>The compatriots in the icy and snowy Northeast are fighting heroically against the Japanese invaders, lacking clothing, food, and equipment, urgently in need of assistance. Therefore, the Shanghai Accountants Association, City Chamber of Commerce, Lawyers Association, and General Labor Union have jointly organized a performance to raise funds for Northeast refugees. Currently, preparations are actively underway. It is reported that the organization has elected Wang Xiaochi as the president, Du Yuesheng, Shi Jingcai, and Yu Qiaqing as vice presidents.

The secretaries are  Chengkui, with Zhu Shifan and Jiang Junyi as deputy secretaries. The secretaries are Yan E'sheng, Zheng Zhengqiu, Tao Rongqin, Ren Jinping, Pan Yihua, Zhou Xuexiang, Lu Lihua, Wang Gang, Yu Hualong, Cao Tangong, Ma Shaoquan,  Jiaxing,</p>
<p>Wang Jian'e, Li Yongxiang, Bian Yuying, Shao Xubai, Ye Xianggao, Tao Gong</p>
<p>ruo, Gao Zhenying, Liu Xinquan, Li Ruzhang, etc. The general office is located on the fifth floor of the Silk Industry Commercial Building on San Ma Road and Shilu. The venue will be at the New World from November 15th. All original performances at the New World will be suspended. Non-professional art groups will participate in the performance, including Peking Opera, spoken drama, song and dance, music, film, sports, martial arts variety shows, famous flowers, and dance stars, comprising ten groups. Tickets are priced at one dollar and are being sold door-to-door by the Shanghai Boy Scouts.</p>
<p>Silk Industry</p>
<p>The Shanghai Silk Industry Association has always been enthusiastic about patriotic endeavors. Recently, in response to the fundraising appeal by the executive committee of the City Chamber of Commerce to aid Northeast refugees, the association convened a meeting and appointed specialists to actively carry out the task. It has been learned that the Hangzhou silk group has pledged a special donation of 5,000 yuan, the Huzhou crepe group a special donation of 4,000 yuan, the Fuchou silk group a special donation of 1,000 yuan, and the Suzhou silk group a special donation of 400 yuan. These special donations were deposited into the Silk Industry Bank yesterday. Furthermore, the Shengjing group will discuss the amount of their special donation tomorrow, and ten stores, including Lao Jiefu and Da Lun from the retail group, will offer a reduced price during the special period, with the profits donated. It is expected that the amount will exceed 5,000 yuan by the end of the month. In addition, each group within the association is assigning representatives to solicit monthly donations from various stores, with excellent results. The monthly amount is approximately 2,000 yuan. It is estimated that the total donation from the industry will be over 30,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Iron Industry</p>
<p>The standing committee has resolved to notify fellow businesses to donate a percentage of their profits during business operations. Bring account books to the association on the usual meeting day this week for reporting. The amount to be donated can be sent monthly by each business to the receiving bank, with the receipt submitted to the association.</p>
<p>Gunny Sack and Cloth Industry</p>
<p>The industry chairman, Cai Zhijie, worked diligently to handle military supplies during the January 28th Shanghai Incident. Recently, due to the Northeast Volunteer Army's arduous fight against the enemy, he has been actively soliciting donations from members and friends, and has already raised over 300 yuan.</p>
<p>Chinese Woolen Factory</p>
<p>Chairman Gu Jiuru, together with Wang Honghui, has been tirelessly soliciting monthly donations from various fellow businesses in recent days. The first collection has already raised several hundred yuan, which has been handed over to the receiving organization.</p>

<p>The association has appointed Liu Zhuqing, Zhang Zisheng, and Jin Chuxiang as fundraising committee members, who have already begun soliciting donations. It is reported that over 100 yuan has already been pledged, and many more businesses are expected to contribute within the next few days.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth Industry</p>
<p>The Shanghai Cotton Industry Association believes that the Northeast volunteer soldiers are fighting in icy conditions with meager clothing and supplies, making relief absolutely imperative. However, in recent years, the industry has been severely impacted by various factors, making fundraising difficult. Therefore, the fourth joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees resolved that, in addition to the association donating 1,000 yuan to be transferred to the Northeast through the Bank of China, all members of the executive and supervisory committees, as well as the market management committee, will serve as fundraising committee members. At 2:00 PM yesterday, a preliminary fundraising meeting was convened, and  Xianting was elected as the director to oversee all matters. The fundraising committee members were divided into seven groups, with four members in each group, who will take turns starting next week to solicit donations from fellow businesses.</p>

Members are urged to participate jointly, and repeated reminders have been sent to report the total amount to demonstrate their commitment.</p>
<p>Medicinal Materials Industry</p>
<p>The Medicinal Materials Industry has been actively soliciting donations from members for Northeast refugee relief, led by standing committee members Fei Tinghua and Chen Wenming.

<p>The judge ultimately approved the transfer to the Public Concession Police Department. From the 16th of last month to the most recent arrests, thirteen male and female Communist Party members were apprehended. Among them were several key figures, such as Wang Xiuzhen, wife of the Communist Party's top leader Li Lisan, and Chen Binghe and Chen Jincai, both executive committee members of the Communist Youth League. The remaining individuals were also not insignificant. The types of reactionary books seized were too numerous to list. The High Court Second Branch ordered them to be detained separately for further investigation. Yesterday morning was the scheduled trial date. Investigating officers escorted Wang Xiuzhen, Zhang Zhujun, Zheng Xiulan, Wang Li's wife, and four other women, along with Chen Binghe, Chen Jincai, Yang Shifang,  Changqing, Zhou Guoxian, He Jinkui, Chen Qiu, Wang Liqing, Zhang Desheng, and nine others, as well as various books and leaflets, to the High Court Second Branch. Judge Yu and assessors Zhao and Guo specially convened a joint court to hear the case. The Municipal Public Security Bureau dispatched officers with an official letter to the court requesting the transfer of all defendants. Attorney Li Zhishan stated that the police department had no objection to the transfer, while several defendants hired attorneys Shi Liang and Deng Jiabing to object to the transfer. A lengthy debate ensued with the Municipal Public Security Bureau's legal counsel, attorney Zhan Jifeng. Ultimately, the court approved the request of the Public Security Bureau's representative attorney and ordered the thirteen men and women, along with the evidence, to be taken back by the Public Security Bureau's officers for further investigation.</p>
<p>Qingchangxiang Foreign Cloth Store</p>
<h3 id="e149">Bomb Thrown Yesterday <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Two-inch-thick counter board blown into a one-foot hole, all electric lights destroyed, window panes shattered. Qingchangxiang Foreign Cloth Store, located at 463-465 Dama Road, French Concession, corner of Dongxin Street, owned by foreign goods magnate Xu Qingyun (nickname Amao), is a large-scale and highly successful business. At 7:45 PM last night, as the store clerks were resting after dinner, a hand-thrown bomb suddenly flew in from the Dongxin Bridge street side entrance and landed in the center of the counter. An employee happened to be standing next to the counter, initially unaware of what it was. Looking outward, he saw a young man dressed in a patriotic cloth Chinese suit glaring at him. Realizing something was wrong, the employee quickly crouched down behind the counter. About ten seconds later, it exploded with a deafening roar, shaking the surrounding area. The entire room was immediately filled with thick smoke. Nearby detectives arrived upon hearing the explosion. A large hole, about a foot in diameter, was blown into the two-inch-thick counter board. Eight panes of glass were shattered, and all electric lights were destroyed. Fortunately, no one was injured. The detectives collected the remaining bomb fragments and took them to the police station for investigation.</p>
<p>The Tragedy of Difficult Childbirth</p>
<h3 id="e150">Inexperienced Midwife Performed Improper Surgery, Resulting in Mother's Death <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>丨Long Iron Hook Used Over Ten Times丨 丨Fetus Broken and Horrific丨 Chen Haibo, a 41-year-old from Yancheng, lives at 1 Tongxing Street, Lujiazhai, Pudong, where he runs a tea stall. His wife, Li, of the same age, has been working at the British American Tobacco factory sorting leaves for six years. Li has given birth to eight children, five of whom have died, leaving three survivors: a 21-year-old son, a 10-year-old daughter, and a 6-year-old daughter. This year, she became pregnant again. On the morning of the 15th of this month, she suddenly felt abdominal pain, indicating that labor was imminent. Chen hired midwife Xu Zhang (51 years old) to assist with the delivery. After taking her pulse, Xu Zhang stated that the baby would be born by 12:00 PM. However, there was still no sign of delivery at that time. Xu Zhang went to another delivery and did not return until 8:00 PM. Seeing his wife in extreme pain, Chen urgently hired another midwife, Tang Lan (35 years old), from Yangjiazhai. After examining her, Lan stated that it was a difficult delivery and only the mother's life could be saved. She went home to retrieve a long iron hook, about five or six inches long, and other tools. Xu Zhang had also arrived to assist. Lan then began the so-called major surgery, inserting the iron hook into the vagina and using it over ten times to remove the fetus, which was already broken and in a horrific state. Seeing that the surgery was complete, the two midwives tidied up slightly and left. However, two days later, the woman's abdomen suddenly swelled, and her condition became critical. Chen obtained a letter of introduction from the British American Tobacco factory and sent his wife to the orthopedic hospital near Fenglin Bridge in Xuhui for treatment. However, the hospital did not have an obstetrics department and referred her to the Red Cross Hospital. Unfortunately, on the 21st, her condition worsened, and she passed away. Chen had no choice but to take his wife's body back home for burial. He then went to the British American Tobacco factory to claim his wife's life savings to cover the costs of the coffin and burial. However, the factory stated that they required a certificate from the local police station's household registration office before releasing the funds. Upon hearing this, Chen went to the Third District Household Registration Office yesterday morning to register. When officials inquired about the cause of death, Chen told them the truth. The officials stated that the two midwives had not registered with the Health Bureau and did not have licenses. They reported this to the district chief, who dispatched police to bring both women in for questioning. Xu Zhang claimed that she did not perform any procedures, while Tang Lan claimed that she did not use a hook but only reached in with her hand to remove the child and that any marks on the child's body were caused by her fingernails. The district chief, considering that a minor registration issue had led to a loss of life, ordered the two women to be sent to the Public Security Bureau for further action. However, the woman's body, although already in the coffin, had not yet been covered, and the court may be requested to conduct an autopsy.</p>

<p>Yang Yijie, representative of Geng Jizhou, commander-in-chief of the Fourth Route Volunteer Army of Liaoning, recently received a telegram from the front lines urging him to return to Liaoning. Since the representative came to Shanghai to seek assistance from various sectors, he has achieved considerable results.

It is now known that the representative is scheduled to return to Liaoning on the first of next month. The affairs of the Shanghai liaison office will be managed by Cao Fengchun, a staff officer from the same route.</p>

<p>Husband claims she was not a virgin, requesting doctor's examination three times. Yesterday, a forensic doctor examined her again. The Difficult Life of Tu Fumei.</p>
<p>Song Tianxiang, a doctor from Ningbo, returned to his hometown in October the year before last and married Tu Fumei, a woman from the same village, through a matchmaker. Soon after, he brought her to Shanghai. After living together for a short time, Song suddenly claimed that Tu was not a virgin. Since then, the couple has been at odds. This summer, Tu, feeling unable to live together, hired Lawyer Wu Peng to file for divorce from Song and request alimony. The First Special District Court has repeatedly summoned both parties for questioning, as reported in previous newspapers. The day before yesterday afternoon, Judge Yang conducted the hearing again. The plaintiff's lawyer, Wu Peng, presented a list of dowry items, as the defendant previously stated that Tu had no dowry when she married, proving that the defendant's statement was false. Judge Yang stated that the point of contention in this case was whether the plaintiff was a virgin. He asked if the doctors summoned to testify were present in court. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that they were all present. First, female doctor Zhong Shuzhen testified that although she examined the plaintiff's uterus, she could not be certain, so she told the defendant at the time to ask another doctor to examine her. Then, Dr. Tang Qingyue of Dade Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital testified that the defendant brought his wife to the hospital to request an examination. He issued a certificate, but he could not definitively prove whether she had given birth or not. Next, Dr. Takayama, a Japanese doctor from Fumin Hospital, testified that on October 25th of the year before last, the defendant and his wife came to the hospital to request an examination of the plaintiff. He confirmed that her hymen was still intact before the marriage and that she had not given birth. However, the defendant claimed to be named Song Wenbin, and the plaintiff claimed to be named Zhang Tu Fumei, saying they were relatives. Then, the plaintiff herself requested that a forensic doctor be sent to examine her again to clarify the truth. The defendant requested that the matchmaker be summoned to testify. Judge Yang adjourned the hearing to summon witnesses for further questioning and ordered Tu Fumei to report to the court at 9:00 a.m. the next morning to await examination by a forensic doctor. Yesterday morning at 9:00 a.m., Tu, following the order, went to the forensic office of the Special Court with her lawyer to request an examination. The doctor had already gone to the forensic examination site on Avenue Petain to examine a corpse. She waited in the lawyer's lounge. The forensic doctor returned to the court at 11:00 a.m. and performed the examination. The results of the examination will be announced at the next court hearing.</p>
<p>12) Jiangsu Bank collected 1 dollar from Ye Xiangtao. 13) Kenyue Bank collected 100 dollars on behalf of Zuile Hall. 14) The Bank of China collected 9 dollars from a certain girls' school. The total amount is 8,992.50 silver dollars.</p>

<p>The newly appointed Baoshan County Magistrate Jin Qingzhang took office at 1:00 p.m. yesterday. The former secretary, Yin Tianxin, handed over all official documents, files, and seals from Magistrate Sun's tenure. Magistrate Jin counted them clearly and declared his assumption of office immediately. Zhang Yinzi was announced as the head of the Finance Section, Zhang Yizhi as the head of the Public Security Section, and the secretary position is temporarily undecided. Chief Wang of the General Affairs Section remains unchanged. When asked about the post-disaster situation in the county, Magistrate Jin replied, "I am currently focusing on internal work and have no opinions to express. However, the morale of the people in this county has been damaged since the disaster. We must pay special attention to resettling refugees. I served as acting magistrate of Baoshan in 1928. Returning to this old place, I see devastation everywhere. Looking back on the past, I have a great sense of vicissitude."</p>
<h3 id="e155">Fishing Organizations Telegram Finance Minister Song Regarding Tax Exemption <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Telegrams Finance Minister Song regarding tax exemption. Various fishing organizations in Jiangsu and Zhejiang sent repeated telegrams to the National Government regarding the request for tax exemption but received no response. Yesterday, they sent another telegram to Finance Minister Song, stating, "To Minister Song of the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing: The National Government's order of March 28th last year, permanently exempting fish tax and fishery tax, was the utmost expression of President Chiang's and your Excellency's care for fishermen. The fishermen of Jiangsu and Zhejiang were moved to tears. They celebrated the elimination of troublesome taxes and planned to revitalize the fishing industry. However, the economic panic has worsened daily, and fishing villages have declined even more than before. At this time, when they have barely recovered, we suddenly hear that the Ministry of Industry is proposing to reimpose the fish tax. This is detrimental to the government's credibility. Your ministry exempted the tax just over a year ago, and the Ministry of Industry is taking over to collect it. From the perspective of the national tax system, this is also a disruption of the unified system. Our association is determined to unanimously oppose the reimposition of the fish tax. In addition to sending a separate telegram to the Ministry of Industry requesting its cancellation, we earnestly request your Excellency's assistance in requesting the cancellation. The Tax Exemption Maintenance Committee of various fishing organizations in Jiangsu and Zhejiang kowtows."</p>

<p>Submitted to the Municipal Government for Review and Implementation. The Finance Bureau is currently preparing the final account for 1931 under orders. Recently, the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics has issued a temporary charter of final account, with forms and formats slightly different from last year. Therefore, the bureau ordered Dong Zaiqin, an employee of the Budget Division, to carefully plan a method to comply with central regulations and benefit the city's financial administration. Currently, Mr. Dong, based on the shortcomings of various agencies in preparing the final account over the years, and in accordance with the latest regulations and accounting principles of the central government, has drafted 21 articles of the "Unified Method for Preparing the Final Account of 1931 by Various Agencies in Shanghai," as well as various forms, formats, subject classifications, and detailed explanations. They have been submitted to the Municipal Government for review. Once approved by the Municipal Government, they will be issued to various agencies for implementation.</p>

<p>Requesting the promulgation of regulations and contributing opinions. Xie Chunpu and two others go to Beijing. Since its establishment, the National Federation of Wireless Radio Stations' Clerks has worked tirelessly, making many contributions to the welfare of clerks nationwide. However, radio station clerks generally have specialized knowledge and are mostly hired after examinations, and their work is the same as other service personnel, but their compensation is uniquely different. After the establishment of the federation, petitioning for regulations became the most important work. However, due to the unstable political situation, it has not been filed. Recently, with Yan Renguang as the new Director of the Telecommunications Administration, the federation, in order to implement its original intention, actively urged the matter to be initiated and selected three standing committee members, Xie Chunpu, etc., to go to Beijing to petition. It is also heard that they have attached opinions on improving the wireless communications business for the authorities to adopt. The details are listed below.</p>
<p>Representatives Go to Beijing to Petition. The National Federation of Wireless Radio Stations' Clerks held its twelfth temporary meeting last Friday to discuss the issue of regulations in particular.

The association believes that these regulations are of great importance to the welfare of clerks nationwide and has submitted them for serious review again.

<h3 id="e161">16th Anniversary Celebration of Jisheng Society <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Society has been in operation for sixteen years. A grand anniversary celebration was held the day before yesterday. Many people attended. President Huang Hanzhi presided over the meeting. President Xu Qianlin reported briefly that the society was founded on a small scale. Fortunately, due to the efforts of colleagues over the past sixteen years, the society's affairs have developed, and relief funds have been distributed to millions. In the future, we should work even harder. Then, the director of relief affairs reported that the society's relief income this year was far less than in the previous two years, but the relief efforts included winter relief and emergency relief in Wugong, Shaanxi, and running a vocational training center for disaster-stricken children. In Quanqiang, Northern Anhui, emergency relief was provided, and a shelter was set up in Bengbu. Grain was distributed in Guangjiwei, Central Anhui, and seeds were provided in various counties in Southern Anhui, and a loan was provided to Fu Shun Silver Company. A congee factory was established in Gaoyou, Jiangsu, and industrial relief was provided in Jiangning. Emergency relief was provided in Tanghe, Deng County, and Xinye, four counties in Southern Henan, and seeds were also provided in Tanghe and Deng County. The Youren and Liangwei dikes were repaired in Nanchang, Jiangxi, and someone is requesting the construction of Guangfengwei. The Ninghai Dike in Zhejiang and the Zhongdu Bridge in Linhai were reconstructed. The congee factories in Beiping, which had two locations last year, only have one location this year. The amount of medicine distributed this year has more than doubled compared to last year. This year, donations are few and the disaster situation is severe. It is hoped that all those present will contribute generously based on the principle of mutual assistance among compatriots. A certain gentleman reported on the income, expenditure, and academic affairs situation. Mr. Zhu Qichen suggested that the society should print a publication to record in detail the number of donations over the past sixteen years, the relief efforts, and the service of members, so that outsiders can understand the spirit of the society. Everyone agreed. A certain gentleman stated that our country is poor and financially exhausted, but the customs revenue has increased year by year. Up to September of this year, it has exceeded five million taels, which is shocking to hear. In addition, domestic and foreign troubles are on the rise, so that the four classes of people cannot live in peace. Since this society has the purpose of saving the country and saving people, it is clear that in this difficult situation, we must do our best to increase agricultural production to enrich livelihoods and persuade people to save the world. It is not enough to save this calamity.</p>

<h3 id="e162">Songjiang Song Bao Details the Course of Forced Suspension <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, a letter was sent to the press in this city for assistance. The Songjiang Song Bao was ordered to suspend publication by the county party headquarters for publishing news about checking enemy goods. The Songjiang compatriots in Shanghai have telegraphed various parties to appeal. Yesterday, the editor of the newspaper, Shen Shoukang, sent an urgent letter to the newspapers and news agencies in this city, detailing the course of forced suspension and requesting speedy assistance. The original letter is copied below. "We, as a newspaper, maintain a detached position, uphold righteousness, and express public opinion. Since its founding a year ago, the newspaper has unfortunately gained the reputation of society and has been deeply jealous of powerful people. They have used all means to slander and harm us. We have fought alone and endured many hardships. This time, the Songjiang County Party Headquarters believed that the newspaper's publication of the news about checking enemy goods on the 21st of this month was an opportunity that could be used to falsely accuse the newspaper of violating laws and inciting trends, and suddenly sent a secret letter to the county government ordering the Public Security Bureau to suspend publication immediately. At the same time, the police were sent to threaten and monitor the typesetting room. On the 23rd, the newspaper was forced to suspend publication for one day. On the 20th, the incident of checking enemy goods was because Yang and Cai of the Songjiang National Salvation Anti-Japanese Association's party branch checked inferior goods in major silk and cloth shops and had a conflict with the shop assistants of Yuanda Silk and Satin Shop in Shenzhuang Street over the issue of sealing goods. The glass cabinet of the shop was crowded by the audience, and the patrol officer of the second branch of the Public Security Bureau also arrived to suppress the situation. Later, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce mediated. The shop closed its doors afterwards. The location is in a busy thoroughfare, and the incident was witnessed by many people. The newspaper reported based on facts, not on baseless accusations. In addition, all newspapers in Shanghai and Shanghai recorded the incident on the same day. Why was the newspaper the only one to be severely reprimanded? After Yang and others checked the goods, they distributed leaflets everywhere. Why did the county party headquarters not punish them? Is it because Yang and others are employees of the party headquarters and can be propagandists of patriotism? Every citizen is responsible for the rise and fall of the country. The newspaper is responsible for public opinion and dares to be patriotic. The recording of facts is also to fulfill its duty. We did not expect to suffer disaster because of this. Although the newspaper seeks benevolence and obtains benevolence, it is willing to die. However, if this trend continues, it will make the righteous people feel cold. Moreover, according to the regulations on reviewing propaganda, the local party headquarters has no right to punish non-reactionary publications. Since the newspaper has no reactionary propaganda, how can the county party headquarters illegally suppress it to this extreme? Therefore, in order to maintain the solemnity of our press, the newspaper has exhausted its efforts and is not afraid of difficulties. The next day (the 24th), the newspaper was printed and published as usual in another location. The county party headquarters became even more arrogant after learning of this. They sent personnel to order the police to detain the couriers and newspaper vendors, and even the librarians were arrested. Postal deliveries were prohibited, and the station was searched. The situation was so arrogant as if facing a formidable enemy. Under such pressure, the newspaper was unable to continue and was forced to announce its suspension again. This new business in Songjiang is still in its infancy. Once destroyed, the righteousness will decline, and public opinion will be destroyed. The corrupt and inferior people will have no scruples, and the local area will be even more unscrupulous. We have always admired your newspaper for upholding justice. We are especially writing this letter to you to detail the situation. We hope that you will take into account our common culture and provide speedy assistance. The newspaper will be very grateful, and public opinion will be very grateful.</p>

<p>To be held at the Ingsih Memorial Hall. Hu Hongji, the former director of the Department of Health, died in a car accident on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway. The municipal government and medical circles were deeply saddened. In addition to the municipal government providing preferential compensation, a memorial service will be held at the Ingsih Memorial Hall on Guizhou Road at 10:00 a.m. today to express condolences. The organizers, in addition to the municipal government and various bureaus, also include Tongji University, Southeast Medical College, and Bethel Hospital.</p>

<p>The Municipal Government Still Rejects. The Pickled Meat and Ham Industry Association of this city previously requested the Municipal Government for exemption from inspection of pickled meat products entering the city, as the Municipal Health Bureau decided to conduct inspections. The Municipal Government has rejected the request. The Municipal Government believes that the inspection of pickled meat products entering the city is for the purpose of maintaining public health for meat consumption. The inspection fee charged is very small and should not have any impact. As for meat products for export to foreign countries, the Health Bureau will notify the central foreign trade commodity inspection agency to send personnel to conduct inspections. Therefore, the request to cancel the inspection is still rejected.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Qiu Changsheng Accused of Conspiring to Seize Inheritance <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Changsheng did not appear at the initial trial, and reasons were given. Therefore, Qiu Weiqing, a wealthy dye merchant with millions in assets, adopted Changsheng as his son. When dividing the inheritance to his biological young son Changyin and young daughter Shuying, Changsheng, together with outsiders Chang Shuliu and Ren Wei'an, managed and kept a portion of it. Qiu, a fair and just relative of the Qiu family, had long held grievances. Recently, Sun, the second wife of Weiqing, and her younger sister Zhu Qiu, hired three lawyers, Zhang Shizhao, Zheng Wenkai, and Peng Yuanxun, to file a private prosecution against Changsheng and Chang, Ren, in the First Special District Court. At 2 PM the other day, Judge Wu Zhen opened the eighth criminal court to hear the case. The defendant Qiu Changsheng did not appear, and his defense lawyer Wang Fuchang requested a postponement. Chang and Ren hired lawyer Wang Youling to wait in court for questioning. Lawyers Zhang and Zheng both emphasized that Qiu Changsheng was the most important defendant in the case and that his absence without a valid reason was inconsistent with the interrogation methods outlined in Article 41 of the Criminal Procedure Law. The court only inquired about the plaintiffs' intentions for the lawsuit and then adjourned. The remaining proceedings were postponed to the next session. The plaintiffs submitted two indictments. The first indictment jointly sued Changsheng and the other two, while the second indictment focused solely on Changsheng's alleged crimes. The latter indictment is explored and described below:</p>
<p>Respectfully submitting additional facts and reasons, respectfully requesting investigation and verification: It has been found that the defendant Qiu Changsheng has long plotted to seize the inheritance. The facts are as follows, selecting the most obvious points to state: (1) Usurping the name and impersonating a biological son: The defendant was originally the son of the Jiang family, and recently, his biological mother hired a lawyer to send a letter demanding his return to the Jiang clan. When he was adopted by the Zhou family, this was well known by the clan. Therefore, when the genealogy was revised in the past, it was specifically noted that he was an adopted son. The defendant, knowing this was inappropriate, funded a separate publication and attempted to buy back the original genealogy. However, some members of the clan refused to comply. The obituary also clearly indicates that he is not a biological son. This is the first step in the defendant's deliberate scheme to fraudulently obtain the inheritance. (2) The late Qiu Weiqing instructed the plaintiff Qiu Sun to raise his biological children Changyin and Shuying as her own. At the time of his death, he bequeathed Changyin and Shuying to be properly supervised by the plaintiff Qiu Sun. However, knowing that the plaintiff was a woman and that Changsheng was unreliable, he ordered his nephew Qiu Shengshan to manage the property, stating that it could only be returned after the children reached adulthood. This is something the defendant cannot deny. However, the defendant conspired to embezzle the property by sweet-talking the plaintiff Zhu Qiu and the deceased Qiu Jia into jointly suing Qiu Juansan in court, resulting in the actual control being entirely in the hands of the defendant alone. This is the second step in the defendant's deliberate scheme to fraudulently obtain the inheritance. (3) The late husband's inheritance should be inherited by his biological children and the plaintiff Qiu Sun. The defendant, being merely an adopted son, should only receive a small portion of the property. However, he unilaterally divided and obtained as much as 45% of the inheritance. This is contrary to legal principles and human sentiment. Therefore, fair-minded members of the clan, such as clan leader Qiu Hengzhi and nephew Qiu Shengshan, refused to sign the distribution document. The defendant still proceeded with decisive actions to seize the property. This is the third step in his deliberate scheme to fraudulently obtain the inheritance. (4) Qiu Changsheng, being an adopted son, has no maternal affection for the plaintiff. After the late husband's death, he showed no respect for elders and acted arbitrarily. Last winter, the plaintiff, suffering from old age and illness, sought funds from Changsheng to go to Hangzhou for medical treatment to avoid his mistreatment. Changsheng initially refused, but eventually forced her to sign an agreement as a condition. The plaintiff was critically ill and in urgent need of funds, so she had no choice but to comply. Therefore, there was the matter of signing an agreement to separate. For the plaintiff, saving her life took precedence over everything else. For Changsheng, forcing his mother to sign an agreement is unforgivable, even if he is an adopted son. She had labored diligently alongside her late husband for sixty years, resulting in today's fortune. After her husband's death, she was forced to separate by her adopted son. Is there any justice in this world? Furthermore, she earnestly went to Hangzhou for medical treatment, listening to his demands, because Qiu Huang was still alive at the time, and Jia, as the biological mother of Yin, could fulfill her educational responsibilities. She could rest assured that Changyin would be properly cared for. Therefore, she temporarily endured Changsheng's demand to leave home. Now, Jia has passed away, and Qiu Zhou, who adopted Changsheng, has conflicting interests due to her emotional involvement, and she may be biased against Changyin. Now that Jia is dead, Changyin's environment is in danger. The late husband's flesh and blood are only Changyin and daughter Shuying. When Jia was alive, she could not question Jia, but now that Jia is dead, if she does not continue to fulfill her responsibility of nurturing them, how can she face her late husband in the afterlife? This is the reason why she must appeal at this time. The defendant is trying to force the plaintiff to separate in order to achieve his goal of complete control. This is the fourth step in his deliberate scheme to fraudulently obtain the inheritance. (5) After Jia passed away on March 4th this year, the defendant immediately attempted to open the iron safe without permission, which was nearly incomprehensible. The police station was notified, and Detective Chen Yaoting was dispatched to guard the safe for over ten days, preventing him from completely seizing the contents. This is the fifth step in the defendant's deliberate scheme to fraudulently obtain the inheritance. (6) The residence at 184 Tongfu Road has already been allocated to Changyin. However, the defendant still occupies it and refuses to move out, and he has installed iron bars inside the house as if facing an enemy, indicating his clear animosity towards the young boy. This situation can be verified with an inspection. This is the sixth step in his deliberate scheme to fraudulently obtain the inheritance. Based on the above points, the defendant has used various fraudulent tactics to gradually gain control of the inheritance acquired by the plaintiff Qiu Sun during her over twenty years of devoted service to Weiqing. He has also used various threats to eliminate dissent, causing the plaintiff Zhu Qiu, as the closest relative, to fail in her responsibility to protect the young children. There is no doubt that this constitutes a crime under Articles 363 and 365 of the Criminal Law. Therefore, this supplementary explanation is submitted, respectfully requesting the court to investigate and handle the case in accordance with the law. This is truly in the public interest. Respectfully submitted to the First Special District Court of Shanghai.</p>

<p>The Huangsha Stone Crushing Industry Association of the Lian'an Lane on Tiantong Road held a meeting after the September 18th Incident to discuss ways to resist Japan. The members of the association were all deeply patriotic and expressed sympathy for the economic boycott. Members supervised each other to ensure compliance. Recently, some unscrupulous individuals in the sand and gravel industry, acting as unpatriotic traitors, dared to contract sand and gravel projects for the enemy, arousing public resentment. The association has received numerous warning letters from patriotic groups, some addressed to Zhang Kaizhi. The association believes that Zhang is not a member and is therefore not responsible for the matter. However, it has decided to rectify internal affairs and convened a meeting today to discuss measures and publish a notice to clarify the truth.</p>

<p>At 2:30 PM the other day, a shooting assassination occurred at 1040 Siwen Lane on Xinzha Road, resulting in the on-the-spot killing of Wang Shouxi (aka Huang Shaoxi) from Yangzhou and wounding Cao Boqian, Wu Xiu, Hao Ming, and Cao's wife, Zhang. The assailants fled. After the incident, the Xinzha Police Station dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to conduct a thorough investigation, uncovering clues. That evening, around 7 PM, they went to 1151 Gordon Road and arrested Tang Zhang, a 22-year-old woman from Danyang. They then proceeded to 290 Herze Road and arrested Xu Runfeng, a 24-year-old man from Jiujiang. Both were taken to the police station. The following morning, police lawyer Wang Yaotang went to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court and stated that the case was of great importance and that the police were investigating the details and could not disclose them. He requested that the two suspects be detained. Judge Wu Zhen briefly questioned the defendants about their age and hometown and ordered them to be detained for seven days for further investigation. Subsequently, Prosecutor Guo Wei, accompanied by a clerk and a coroner, went to the autopsy site on Feilun Road to examine the body. After the examination, Mr. Guo announced that the deceased Wang Shouxi had died from gunshot wounds inflicted before his death. The body was handed over to Pushan Mountain for burial. The police station was instructed to strictly apprehend the fleeing perpetrators and bring them to justice.</p>

Four men and one woman were arrested. The arrested suspects gave the following statements: (1) Niu Jinpu, 36 years old, from Hefei, Anhui, residing at 6 Meihua Lane, Jupulai Si Road, French Concession, currently the commander of the 3rd platoon of the Special Service Company of the Tax Police Regiment, now stationed in Haizhou. (2) Zheng Shaobo, 27 years old, from Hefei, Anhui, residing at the home of Zhu Guangfu at 2 Denghou Lane, near the Jiuxing Grand Theater, French Concession, formerly a personal guard for Commander Huang of the 88th Division's Independent Brigade. (3) Li Yinghan, 21 years old, from Hefei, Anhui, residing at 7 Dunhou Lane, Julai Da Road, a carpenter. (4) Sun Hanquan, 32 years old, from Hefei, Anhui, residing at 6 Deyuan Lane, Pushi Road, formerly a soldier in the 3rd platoon of the Special Service Company of the Tax Police Regiment. (5) Niu Lang, 32 years old, from Hefei, Anhui, residing at 6 Meihua Lane, Juplai Si Road, married to Niu Jinpu for six years. She stated that her husband was a platoon commander in the Special Service Company and that he took leave to seek medical treatment in Shanghai for an eye ailment. She added, "When my husband was a platoon commander, I worked at a cotton mill in Yangshupu. I do not know what he did outside. Please investigate." (6) Shao, 32 years old, from Chaoxian, Anhui, residing at 6 Deyuan Lane, Pushi Road. She stated, "I used to work as a domestic helper at Niu Jinpu's house. Sun Hanquan often visited Niu's house, so I know Sun. After Niu's wife Lang came to Shanghai, Niu dismissed me and I went to work elsewhere for about two months. Sun Hanquan often visited me, so I quit my job and went to live with Sun Hanquan at Qian Laowu's house. After living there for a long time, it became inconvenient, so Sun Hanquan and I rented a house together in Deyuan Lane. I do not know what Sun did. Please investigate." After verifying the statements, Team Leader Lu was about to proceed when the Songjiang County Government learned of the arrests and sent the captain of the county Public Security Bureau's Detective Team to request the transfer of the suspects for investigation in Songjiang. Team Leader Lu sought instructions from Director Wen, who approved the transfer of the suspects to Songjiang for legal proceedings. It is reported that Songjiang has also apprehended one of the robbers who is currently under interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Car Driver Bigamy <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Huang Er girl reported the crime and the driver was sentenced to three years in prison. Zhou Heyi, a 31-year-old car driver from Yangzhou, married Huang Er, a woman from Huaicheng, in Shanghai in 1927. They lived together in a bungalow at 7 Lane 194 Jupulai Si Road, French Concession. This year, in July, Huang Er discovered that Zhou already had a wife, Wu, a woman from his hometown whom he had married in 1921. Wu currently lives in the countryside with Zhou's mother. Huang Er confronted Zhou, but he could not make a decision. On the 4th of this month, Huang Er went to the French police station and accused Zhou of bigamy, requesting his arrest and investigation, stating that she was unwilling to be Zhou's concubine. The police arrested Zhou and brought him to the Second Special District Court, which filed a public prosecution under Article 254 of the Criminal Law. Zhou confessed that his first wife, Wu, had run away and not returned, so he married Huang. He also said that the matchmaker had explained the situation and that he did not understand the law and had not gone through divorce procedures. This spring, Wu suddenly came back and lived with his mother in the countryside. He was now asking relatives to negotiate, allowing him to live with Huang and ignoring Wu. He also hired a lawyer to defend him. The court announced the conclusion of the arguments. Yesterday morning, Judge Wang Gangxu of the First Criminal Court sentenced Zhou Heyi to three years of imprisonment for the crime of bigamy. The defendant remained on his original bail.</p>

<h3 id="e177">Eating Clams and Growing Beards <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>The Chinese way of relieving boredom is called "[Don't talk about national affairs, eat clams]" This is based on two sentences in the Southern History: "[I don't know what happened, eat clams]" and then changed.</p>
<p>The foreign way of relieving boredom is called "[Don't talk about the recession, grow a beard]" This is a recent anecdote that happened in Nebraska, USA.</p>
<p>Nebraska is a famous prosperous metropolis on the west bank of the Mississippi River, but recently, a cloud of recession has enveloped it. People coming and going in the state are talking about the situation of the recession with furrowed brows. Later, they knew that talking was useless, only adding to the weight of the sadness in everyone's chest. So, the people of the state came up with a way to relieve boredom. All adult men grew beards together. Once they grew a beard, they were tagged with a "[Don't talk about the recession]" sign. Anyone who violates the rule must be fined, and the money from the fine is used as funding for the "[Harvest Festival]" on the 21st and 22nd of last month.</p>
<p>Indeed, with the beard-growing society, many sad atmospheres were eliminated. Everyone stopped talking about the recession and continued to encourage their fighting spirit, restoring the state's past prosperity. If someone asks, "How long will you keep your beard?" they will answer without hesitation, "Until the day prosperity returns." This way of relieving boredom is similar to our country's tradition of "[Don't talk about national affairs, eat clams]" in some ways, but it is also very different in most ways. The recession in the United States is an accidental encounter. It is not known whether this year's recession will turn into prosperity next year. Our national affairs have a trend of getting worse year by year. "[Waiting for the Yellow River to clear, how long will people live?]" If someone asks us, "How long will you eat these clams?" we will also answer without hesitation, "Until the day of peace returns." Then, people will shake their heads in disbelief, or say with a cold laugh, "Hum! Even if you eat clams all your life, you may not have the hope of meeting prosperity again."</p>

<p>— Xu Lianfu</p>
<p>There is an old joke that says, "[Four people, A, B, C, and D, all like to play chess. A and B learned the image of 'a general fighting each other.' As soon as they met, they occupied a room and started playing Chinese chess. C and D, however, disliked the vulgarity of Chinese chess and played the distinct black-and-white Go in the room next to A and B. After a long time, A and B quarreled over the issue of regretting moves, even resorting to violence. But when they heard that the Go friends next door were completely silent, they couldn't help but look at each other and said, 'After all, the gentlemen who play Go have much higher character!' We are all playing chess, but we are making such a fuss. Compared to their quiet and humble attitude, we are truly ashamed.' So, they abandoned the quarrel and decided to go and see C and D's Go. But when they entered the room, they only saw scattered chess pieces, black and white mixed up, and could not find C and D. The two were greatly surprised! Looking around, they found C and D huddled together, crouching in the corner behind the wall, unresponsive when called and unmoved when pushed. Touching their bodies, they were both stiff and icy, and they had died! It turned out that they fought to the death because of mutual fights, and they fought until C strangled D's throat against the wall and D grabbed C's testicles. The two of them became a dead end!"</p>
<p>The more high-ranking and respected gentlemen are, the more likely they are to fight to the death! It is a pity that this chaotic situation is even more hopeless to resolve!</p>

<p>— Jiuzhi</p>
<p>In recent years, the morals of the world have been declining, and the tricks of deception at sea are becoming more and more bizarre. My younger brother told me that the other day, because of illness, he went to Huang Yizhao, a one-finger Zen massage doctor, for treatment. He heard someone outside the window at the registration desk asking for a doctor. Huang said, "Today, another person is trying to use counterfeit money!" He hurried out and, after a while, returned to the examination room. My younger brother asked how he knew someone was using counterfeit money. Huang said, "I heard something strange in his words. He claimed to live on Route Lafayette and, because his father was ill, he was introduced by the Zhang residence on the same road to invite me for a consultation. This is normal. What's strange is that he said he came from Route Lafayette, but his direction was from south to north. My house is located on South Chengdu Road near Changbang Road, and it's the first house at the entrance of Alley 21. It's easy to find when looking from south to north, but he said he went straight to North Chengdu Road before turning back here. Considering the circumstances, I suspected him, so I investigated. According to the registration desk, he initially presented two ten-yuan bills, asked to get a number for a consultation, and asked for a change of seven yuan and two jiao. Then, he registered for an outpatient number, took back one ten-yuan bill, and asked for a change of seven yuan and ten jiao. Moreover, he said that his father's illness was the same as Mr. Zhang's. Mr. Zhang's chronic illness is very serious, and he has been treated by me for many days but still cannot leave the house. Yet, this person suddenly wanted to get a number and come here for treatment. Considering the illness, I found it contradictory, so I knew he was using counterfeit money. Fortunately, the person registering at my house was alert and, seeing his panicked appearance, didn't want to repeat yesterday's mistake. So, he held the bill he presented, intending to exchange it at a tobacco and paper store. Seeing that his plan wouldn't work, he quickly snatched the bill and left." My younger brother was speechless with amazement after hearing this.</p>

<p>| Postscript to the Lost Manuscripts of Jiang Sishi Yu'an Meihua'an | Li Meihua'an of Linchuan, my teacher, has passed away for twelve years. Many of his lost manuscripts were occasionally seen in the margins of books and in letters. Hu Guangwei Xiaoshi, a fellow student, invited the teacher's son, Zhongqian, in the second month of the year Jiazi, and gathered at Mr. Nongran's studio. They held the teacher's lost writings, like when he jokingly signed "The Complete Book of Everything," totaling seventeen volumes. They copied and compiled six volumes and sent them to the Sanyuan Jingshe, while entrusting the remaining writings to Zhongqian. Among all his sons, the teacher loved Zhongqian the most. He personally taught him, and Zhongqian inherited his calligraphic skills, able to establish himself. After the fifteenth of that month, Bang and Yinshuang concluded at the Youmei Hall on the lake. Mr. Sanyuan built a congratulatory green cottage, showed the copy, and returned it. Due to his aging mood, he didn't bother to manage it. Later, he finally obtained his preface. Bang carefully examined the teacher's lost writings, finding many errors or incompleteness, with some parts drafted by his students. Correspondence with friends, like chronological arrangements, could not be known without someone as intimate and loving as Zhongqian. However, Zhongqian was slow and procrastinating. Although Bang urged him, he couldn't complete it for years. In the small spring of the year Bingyin, Zhongqian went far to Nanyang, and news of him ceased. Some even said he was no longer in this world. Alas, will the teacher's lost writings ultimately remain sealed in a worn-out box, their voice and glory hidden as if they never existed? Bang's learning is rough and fragmented, and he dared not take on the heavy task. Knowing that changes require thorough investigation, he consulted with fellow students Zhang Shanzi Daqian and Jiang Wanping Zhu Dake, urging Xiaoshi again, but without response. Turning to strict supervision of Bang, he reluctantly took what was compiled, categorized, and chronologically arranged, along with what he knew, and divided the lost writings into several volumes. He also divided the years of compiled manuscripts into several volumes of lost drafts. The seventeen volumes of lost ink that Zhongqian took were also found after much searching, but they were fragmented and scattered, with multiple hands, and messy scribbles, making them impossible to compile. Working day and night, he sifted through them, making a collection of lost ink and writings. At the end, he attached the teacher's remarks on his fiftieth birthday and eulogies, asking his friend Yiping Zhai to finalize them. After completion, the fellow students planned to publish them. Alas! The teacher's noble character and integrity were such that, after the national upheaval, even children and vendors knew of the Qing Daoist. His solitary indignation was expressed in his writings, and the world should understand his suffering. His calligraphy integrated the North and South, blending steles and rubbings, imitating the Tang and Song, following the Six Dynasties, tracing back to the Qin and Han, and leading back to the Three Dynasties. Freed from stone, he sought from tripods and platters, Yuzhao's Dragon Gate, and Kongmen's calligraphy. The teacher should have been an expert, but unfortunately he passed away early and had no monographs. A scale and a claw are only occasionally seen in Lu Shi's script in Zhonglang Zi'an's collection. With no Baishi in the world, who can continue Guo Ting's calligraphy manual? Therefore, the teacher's legacy should be even more cherished than the theories established by recent scholars Ruan and Bao. Mr. Nongran initially held the teacher's teachings, but it was not here, and Zhongqian secretly held his strength. He knew that scholars would still rely on this for exposure. It is painful that the teacher sold his calligraphy for a living, a deep hidden pain. Having failed to adorn him with a yellow crown and invite a posthumous title, his resentment lies buried in the spring. If this culture is not extinguished, perhaps it will also fulfill the teacher's legacy? It is also touching that Zhongqian, with his early reputation like a bright pearl, and deep love like a copper plate, fully prepared for kindness and grace, should have persevered, but ultimately ended up in a foreign land, entrusting this heavy burden. It is only entrusted to someone like Guo Bang, who has no skill or art to inherit his virtue. In a year when foreign enemies are invading, he is undertaking the task of investigating star notes, worrying about the sky and pointing to the sun, guarding the gate and remaining doubtful. This compilation is worthless. Alas! Eight-brick broken inkstone, a scroll of spring clouds, tears dripping on the Yellow Dragon, spirits saddened at Niu Shou (the teacher's collection of Ruan's Eight-Brick Inkstone and Gao Fangshan's Spring Clouds at Dawn scroll both belong to my studio), caressing relics is also a self-redemption. Xiaoshi initiated the compilation, and the Jiang and Zhang disciples facilitated it later. The teacher's disciples are sincere, and their friendship is unmatched. As for the diligence of copying and interviewing, Zhong Jun Dehan's son Xiqin also worked hard. Winter Solstice, year Xinwei.</p>

<p>— Fan Yanqiao</p>
<p>It came, the elevator came. Gengsheng let the woman step in first, following closely behind. A briefcase accidentally bumped her right arm. She recoiled her right arm, cast a glance at Gengsheng, followed by an extremely slight, extremely faint smile. This smile added even more to Gengsheng's suspicions. Although she was being reserved for the sake of her red lips, the two shallow dimples on her rosy cheeks clearly revealed Ai Gu's characteristics. The elevator reached the ground floor. Chi let her go first. He followed behind, seeing her slip into a white-plated car and whirring away. He let go of all his fantasies and went to do his official business.</p>
<p>That evening, he went to the Southeast Hotel to find the company commander again. It was already past twelve o'clock. The elevator was extremely crowded with passengers. He was forced into a corner of the elevator by a woman who squeezed in from the second floor, making it difficult to even breathe. Finally, he heard the elevator operator say, "Fourth floor!" He pushed through the crowd and walked out. Hey! He met the woman again. The one who came in on the ground floor didn't have this woman. This woman must have been the one who squeezed in on the second floor, making it difficult for me to breathe. Walk over. Turning back to look, it was even stranger. It was the woman he suspected to be Ai Gu during the day. At this point, he couldn't help but be a little careful. He deliberately walked slower, letting the woman walk ahead, and then followed. He turned a corner and stopped in front of room 436. The room attendant came to open the door, and she walked in. With a bang, the door closed.</p>
<p>After he met with the company commander and finished his official business, he came out and walked past 436, seeing the door still closed. The nameplate on the door read "Jiang." He was discouraged. But when he reached the ground floor, his dead heart rekindled. He asked the cashier, "What kind of person lives in room four hundred and thirty-six?" The cashier, seeing that he was wearing a military uniform, a armed belt, and carrying a briefcase, did not dare to be slow and had a somewhat flattering attitude. He went to flip through the guest register and came back to say, "She's been here for a month. She seems to be from Suzhou. I don't know what she does. If you want to find out, ask the room attendant." At this time, a very young man next to him interjected, "Four hundred and thirty-six?" He smiled and said, "A dancer from the Neon Dance Hall." Gengsheng didn't ask any further. Instead, the cashier minded his own business and asked the young man, "How do you know?"</p>
<p>"Don't you read the tabloids? Who doesn't know the famous Jiang Aili?"</p>
<p>"I'm ashamed. How could I not notice this bright and shining dancing star, constantly flashing before my eyes?"</p>
<p>"I even saw a secret history of her published in a Shanghai tabloid, saying that she was a concubine who was divorced from a wealthy family in Suzhou. Recently, she was also taken by a Suzhou refugee, who will probably return to Suzhou to be his concubine."</p>
<p>"Hmph! ...... Women these days are really carefree. Today, they are happy to cohabitate with you. Tomorrow, they are unhappy and take my clear autumn road." "That's not entirely the women's fault. In many cases, it's really the men's fault."</p>
<p>"..............."</p>
<p>The young man leaned closer and whispered to the cashier, "Four hundred and thirty-six is here."</p>
<p>Gengsheng didn't have anything else to ask. He walked out of the cashier's room and came face to face with the woman. The woman looked at him, but stopped. Gengsheng looked at her and also stopped. Even the people walking in and out stopped. Gengsheng was the first to feel embarrassed and turned to leave. The woman suddenly caught up and asked, "May I ask your esteemed name?"</p>
<p>This abrupt question was naturally very tense. He replied, "My surname is Liu," while reviewing her from head to toe again, and then calmly responded.</p>
<p>"Where is your home?"</p>
<p>"A village in the countryside of Suzhou."</p>
<p>"What is the name of the place?"</p>
<p>"Cuiwei Village."</p>
<p>"Hmm! ......" She was so anxious that she almost shouted it out. She calmed herself down and looked at Gengsheng again, especially paying attention to the number cloth on his chest. Gengsheng also felt it, so he simply told her everything, saving himself from constantly holding it in. Perhaps after saying it, there would be new developments. ...... Sure enough, the woman heard him say that his name was Liu Gengsheng, guessing that she disliked the name A'gen and changed it. It was the same as her changing her name to Jiang Aili. At this point, there was no need to be suspicious. It must be him. So, she said, "I am Ai Gu. Do you have something to talk about? Would you like to come to my room to discuss it in detail?"</p>

<h3 id="e182">Financial and Gold Markets Accelerate Their Rise <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>| High of 782 Taels |</p>
<p>(Soaring by over 13 Taels) Yesterday, the upward trend intensified, rapidly advancing with few setbacks. From morning to noon, fluctuations were limited to around 3.4 taels, ultimately resulting in a sharp increase of more than 13 taels. New high prices emerged daily. The opening already saw a surge of 10 taels, mainly due to the steep drop in both near-term and far-term silver prices, coupled with the dramatic fall of exchange rates by as much as 0.04, which boosted the morale of Shanghai market peers. Short sellers were greatly stimulated and rushed to cover their positions. Tight foreign exchange further sharpened the gold price, driving it forward. After slight rises and falls along the way, the price reached a new record of 782 taels at the close of the morning session. Due to the market being closed on Saturday, swaps were made by short sellers Ruikang Dadecheng to long sellers Yingfeng Heng, posting 2.5 taels. Also, Ruixing and Senchang Yong swapped, posting 2.5 to 3 taels, but the amounts were not large. This week's situation was extremely sharp, although there were no drastic changes, the price flew and soared, indeed due to the frequent trends in exchange rates and cotton. However, complex foreign news and the unclear US debt case made the gold market particularly erratic. From the smallest of 56.1 taels on Monday, it hovered between 60 and 70 taels until the weekend's maximum of 82 taels. The entire week saw a review of 25.9 taels, with a total increase of over 23 taels. Observing the overall trend, the gold market still favors the long side, perhaps because exchange rates are unlikely to turn upward. The details of yesterday's market are recorded below:</p>
<p>(Morning Session Rises by 10 Taels) The one-month contract opened at 779 taels, soaring by 10.01 taels (before the opening, the off-market price was 78-79 taels to 81 taels, then back to 80 taels, and Hengyu bought in at 80 taels). Then there were fluctuations of 8-9 qian. Daxing Yonghong Kangyong sold short positions. Soon after, Tong Taichang Yifeng Yongzhao Fengchang Yuanyong Bingxing Fuyu Wanxing and others rose up like clouds, vying to buy. The US dollar also strengthened. The one-month against-trade was 81.25, so it rose again to 81 taels. At this time, Pangen issued a three-month contract at 29 yuan, and the February against-trade was 93.75. North Korea issued a one-month contract at 81.25, and Hengyu Qianchang Xiangzhen Changxiang and other long positions took advantage of this to sell, immediately returning to 2.02. At 9:15, it was 78.7 taels. Afterwards, the buying side became active again, with Tong Taichang Yuanmaoyong Dadecheng Maofeng Yongfutai and others buying in. As HSBC quoted a reduction of 1.25 for British gold and a small half yuan for US dollars due to exchange rate adjustments, the gold price then rose again to 80.4 taels. Afterwards, the domestic market stabilized, and the withdrawals from various firms were sporadic, but the price trend seemed to decline, only fluctuating around 79 taels. Until after 10 o'clock, Hong Kangyong Yuan Hengyuantai and hedgers disposed of their positions, and Citibank issued a one-month US dollar contract at 81.25 and Zhejiang issued a February contract at 93.75. There were also rumors of an extension of war bonds, so at 10:30, it was only 78.6 taels. Afterwards, the buying side rose again, with Bingxing Hengyu Yongfeng Hengchang Yongzhifeng Yong Tong Taichang Futai Heng and Ruixing, on behalf of foreign merchant Qiao Zhifu, making efforts to advance, occasionally covering short positions, causing the price to rebound again, breaking through the 80 tael mark, but it fluctuated around 1 tael in an instant. At 11:30, it was 81.12 taels. Almost only the one-month US dollar settled at 75 and the February contract was absorbed by the bank at 93.75. Moments later, Hengyu came to sell, sharply reducing 1.4 taels. At 11:45, it was 79.8 taels. In an instant, another high point was seen. Zhifeng Yong Neixing Zhaofeng Changyuan Taiyuan Xingyong and Dalian Gang swarmed in, raising the price by 2.0 taels, reaching 82 taels. At the noon close, it was 81.9 taels, then it rose to 2.67 taels as Hengyu Yifeng Yongfu advanced. Finally, Dalian Gang slightly sold, returning to 2.0 taels, a sharp increase of over 13 taels compared to the previous day (according to the posted price). The highest price in the half-day was 82 taels, the lowest price was 78.6 taels, with a difference of 3.4 taels. The bare bar was calculated to be 12.5 taels. The quoted price was changed to 846 taels with a small half yuan for US dollars, a reduction of 66-67 taels. At noon, it was 64 taels, 2 taels more than the previous day. The account shows 89 taels for this month, 88 taels for next month, 82 taels for January, and 84 taels for supplemental water.</p>
<p>(Demand Increases Significantly) Trading on the table was still active, with more buyers than sellers. Statistics show that Tong Taichang, Wanxing (Ruixing on behalf of Qiao Zhifu), Shunli, Dadecheng, Bingxing, Hengchang Yong, Yuanmaoyong, Fuyu, Zhifeng Yong, Yuanxingyong, and Futai Heng Zhaofengchang all bought in. Daxingyong, Yuanchun, Fuchang, and Yuanhengyong all had varying ins and outs. Yuantai, Qianchangxiang, Yuankangxiang, Hongkangyong, and Zhenchangxiang all sold out. Yifengyong sold about 1,000 bars and also bought in 200-300 bars. Hengyu had frequent ins and outs due to many clients, so the transactions were complex. Dalian Gang bought in a total of 600-700 bars and sold out 200-300 bars. The Guangdong Gang remained on the sidelines. Hengxing only bought in several thousand bars. It was found that the total number of bars at various firms was approximately 19,300.</p>

<p>Because the buying situation in the market yesterday morning was very weak and appetite completely stopped, the banks were particularly quiet and not as prosperous as in previous days, and the market atmosphere was finally depressed, with prices falling. By noon, nearly one million had still been sold, and although the banks had no transactions, other financial circles were still competing to buy, so the prices rose again immediately, and the people's hearts were invigorated again.</p>
<p>(Early Drop and Noon Rise in Interest Rates, Result is Similar) [Foreign Interest Rates] The early market fell by 1.125 qian compared to the previous market, to 7.12 qian.

The result was slightly better by 0.0125 qian compared to the previous market. [Silver Interest] Both markets were at 0.04, a decrease of 0.01 compared to the previous day. As there were many front-loaded transactions, the inflows and outflows were slow, so all were white-marked without any added water.</p>
<p>(Jiangnan Copper Coins are the Same, Guangdong is Slightly Smaller) The early and noon markets for Jiangnan small foreign coins remained the same as the previous day, at 6.19 qian, and the transaction was only 7,000 jiao in the early market, with the situation being very stable.

As for the source, in addition to more than 100,000 arriving from Nanjing and Zhenjiang, there were no other reports. Since the end of the month is approaching, there is a slight income, so 300,000 to 400,000 are sent to the money houses. It is found that securities trading is calmer than in the past, so daily settlements are not as tight as in the past, and the use of foreign money in the market is very idle.</p>

<p>丨The Last Transaction of Yarn This Month Dropped Five Cents丨</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market has entered a quiet and lifeless state, but the trend is still softening. The actual demand in the market is quite sluggish, and all parties show no enthusiasm. The end of the year is approaching rapidly, and funds are becoming tighter, so most people are bearish. Today is the last day of this month. The short sellers slightly reduced their positions and hedged into other months, so the situation remained calm. However, in the last transaction, the sellers were extremely strong, resulting in a drop of five cents, to 138.5 taels, with a total transaction volume of approximately 4,000 bales.</p>
<p>(People's Standard Stagnation) The People's Standard market opened lower, influenced by the downward trend of American cotton. Trading in the market was light, and selling pressure was not strong. Due to the increase in gold prices, prices for all months rose by two, three, four, and six cents. In the afternoon, the current month fell by nine cents, while distant months rose by one cent. The total transaction volume for the day was 28,700 bales. The transaction volume for the previous month was 17,000 bales. Shipments included 1,100 bales from Zilai, 750 bales from Shenji, 650 bales from Yiyu, and 450 bales from Xincheng. Purchases included 950 bales from Jifeng, 850 bales from Yukang, 750 bales from Renfeng, 500 bales from Gengfeng, and 550 bales from Dafeng. The closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>People's Standard Closing Prices, Gains/Losses, and Account Balances: 21,430, up 447,750.</p>

<p>February: 141.5391,400. Total: 260,050.</p>
<p>(Actual Demand Even More Stagnant) The consumption of spot yarn is exceptionally quiet. Throughout the day, all parties only traded 196 bales. The market is flat and weak. The purchase amounts of each party are listed below:</p>

<p>丨Stocks Appear Too Scarce丨</p>
<p>American cotton has been trending downward for days, and spot prices have also broken the six-cent mark. However, due to the surge in gold prices and the depreciation of exchange rates, prices have risen in effect, if not in appearance. Therefore, the market not only has not fallen, but has tended to rise. The main reason is the lack of arrivals from all sources and the weakness of inventories. Therefore, the yarn market is sluggish and the environment is deteriorating. All these situations are viewed pessimistically. However, the stocks of local cotton are too small. The delivery volume in November was less than 10,000 dan. Although foreign cotton prices are cheap, they are difficult to import to Shanghai due to the influence of exchange rates. As a result, even if some manufacturers try to sell off, there is no room for prices to fall in the near future.</p>
<p>(Zheng Standard Near Good by Two Cents) The Zheng Standard market opened higher. Due to the rise in gold prices, even though American cotton fell, the calculated silver price was still high, so there was a lack of new sellers in the market. Prices for all months rose by five cents to one cent. In the afternoon, prices rose again by five cents to one cent. The total transaction volume for the day was 36,000 dan, compared to 64,000 dan on the previous day. Shipments included 4,100 dan from Shenchang, 2,800 dan from Yuanxingchang, 1,300 dan from Mingde, and 4,400 dan from Rongxing. Purchases included 1,900 dan from Changfeng, 1,000 dan from Yifeng, and 1,000 dan from Tongxing. The closing prices are listed below: Zheng Standard Closing Prices, Gains/Losses, and Account Balances: 33,180, up 1,096,800.</p>

<p>New York, November 25th dispatch: This week, the cotton market in the South slightly sold off, but it was mostly offset by purchases from fellow traders. General transactions were restricted due to the lack of progress on war debt issues. Most December futures positions were closed out before the date of delivery notices, and distant month positions were also closed out from time to time, resulting in a price easing. Only a small amount of buying interest occurred when prices fell, and merchants appeared willing to wait for further developments in the spot market in the South or the general situation. It is reported that Japanese traders have purchased raw cotton at low prices, and European traders have recently purchased a small amount. Reports estimating a decrease of 200,000 bales in Chinese cotton production and news of the Egyptian government restricting cotton fields next year have had no significant impact on the New York market.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, about thirty to forty ships from various parties arrived. Sales on this street were smooth, and there were some scattered transactions. The market for thin rice and early rice was poor, except for short-sized Changxi Beigeng and Sutong Baigeng. Ban Yang Dujian arrived and sold evenly. The market showed no upward or downward movement.</p>
<p>(Xinzha) Although there were few arrivals yesterday, there are about 250 accumulated boats of riverside dealers, each with about 80 shi, totaling about 20,000 dan of goods. The market opened in the morning with a general drop of one jiao for thick geng, early thin rice. However, the Bianyin Yuan wine dealers had some dealings, and the market stabilized. The Lupu Jian had no interest at all from downstream.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Customer Xian Min Sales Continue Strong <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market was nonexistent and still in a state of stagnation. There were continued arrivals of Hunan and Jiangxi customer xian, totaling 3,000 bags. However, the customer xian business was very active in Fujian, with Quanzhou and the provincial capital showing great interest. However, fearing a sharp rise in prices, they did not fully load. Yesterday, Quanzhou had a stronger interest than the provincial capital, which yielded to Quanzhou. Quanzhou originally planned to take over more than 200,000 bags designated for the disaster area in southern Fujian, with Jinjiang County alone accounting for more than 50,000 bags, and other places accounting for 20,000, 30,000, or 50,000 bags. Currently, only one-tenth or two-tenths has been loaded. It is expected that there will be a huge amount of consumption in the future. The provincial capital has even greater interest, and there is a military demand. Therefore, the market will continue to be smooth and orderly in the future. If the market becomes too large, it may be necessary to change to other ports for inquiry. Yesterday, the general market opened with 2,500 bags of Hunan machine oil rice at 8 yuan, 8 jiao, 2 fen, and 8 yuan, 7 jiao, followed by 8 yuan, 5 jiao. There were also 380 bags of Machine Jinggang rice at 8 yuan, 3 jiao. There were also 300 bags of Jing rice at 7 yuan, 2 jiao and a half to 2 jiao. There were also 70 bags of Machine Mi rice at 8 yuan. Anqi coarse Yuan rice had a new arrival yesterday and sold 250 bags at 6 yuan, 3 jiao to 6 yuan, 1 jiao. In addition to the local Beibang, which took 200-300 bags, Fuzhou took 400 bags, and the rest were all taken by Quanzhou.</p>
<h3 id="e196">The Starch Market Shows Stable Trend Following Factory <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening in the morning and afternoon, the starch market generally showed stability. Foreign wheat quotations fluctuated slightly. However, most manufacturers were still hesitant to sell, and general short sellers had little to do because of the low exchange rate and the near absence of Australian wheat quotations. Therefore, short sellers had some covering. The current month was still affected by spot conditions, and Hwafung had covering in all transactions. December had a slight sale. Distant months saw the market rising gradually due to the persistent support of large factories. Future rises and falls will depend on the state of the factories. As a result, the current month rose by 2.5 li compared to the previous day, December rose by 7.5 li, January rose by 2.5 li, February, March, and April rose by 1 fen, and April rose by 7.5 li.</p>
<h3 id="e197">The Wheat Futures Market Is Relatively Lively <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>亅Many Long and Short Positions Closed Out in This Month丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the market opened in the morning and afternoon, the wheat futures market showed a slight vitality, and trading was also slightly smoother. As the current month was the last day, many long and short positions were closed out. The opening price in the morning was 3 qian 5 fen, then down a little bit. The market generally revolved around December to January in the afternoon with little trading and no change in the market. Trading in March and April was smooth. The market rose slightly due to the continued rise in the gold market. As a result, the current month was slightly lower by 1 fen compared to the previous day, March was better by 1 fen, April was better by 2 fen, and there was no change in the rest.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Chicago Wheat Drops Slightly <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Company reported on Friday (25th) that Chicago wheat was extremely weak due to the influence of the Liverpool market. After the December contract created a record low of 41.5, the price rebounded due to the poor winter production report. As a result, it fell by 0.25 to 0.5 fen compared to the previous day. The total transaction volume on the 23rd was 20 million bushels. The closing prices on the 25th are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>

<h3 id="e199">Silk Tea India Increases Import Tax <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>Rough Silk Sales to India Become Difficult</p>
<p>Since the Indian government implemented an increased import tax on raw silk, the cost of shipping Chinese silk to India has increased. Indian merchants in Shanghai are reluctant to buy yellow and white rough silk due to the high prices, and imports have decreased. Since the new silk came on the market this year, Indian merchants have purchased less than 50% of the amount of yellow and white rough silk compared to previous years. The number of Chinese silk shipments to India on ships to England has been decreasing. The sales of rough silk to India are unlikely to improve in the short term due to the high tax.</p>
<h3 id="e200">The Depression Slightly Moves The Precious Eyebrows' Sales <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>The precious eyebrow green tea from Wuyuan and Tunxi has recently seen a slight increase in sales to Europe due to the repeated price drops in tea. British merchants such as Yihe, Xiehe, Jinlong, and Tongyun have had telegram transactions almost daily, with a total transaction volume of no less than 1,200 boxes. Most merchants have also sent out large numbers of telegrams, and the market is slightly more active than before. However, Wubei precious eyebrow has fallen to over 80 taels, Tunxi Wudong goods have fallen to 60-70 taels, Xixian Weiping goods have fallen to 50 taels, and Wenzhou Tuzhuang goods have fallen to 30-40 taels. Chinese tea merchants have suffered exceptionally large losses.</p>
<h3 id="e201">The Sugar Market Coarse Sand White City Trend Rises Again <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>丨丨丨 But No Transaction丨丨丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a further rise in the gold price and repeated shrinkage in the Dutch exchange rate. The official price set by the association boosted confidence. No. 24 coarse sand white [unclear] was priced at 15.5 taels, and ordinary goods were priced at 15.3 taels. However, because the actual sales were weak, no transactions took place. However, with the cost of capital increasing, it seems difficult to suppress the market in the future. A new shipment of Qing brand was continuously transported by Yihuo Company Hengsheng ships totaling more than 700 bags. Because the market was weak, only a hundred or so bags were sold, and the price fell to 8 taels and 9 qian. Today is a Sunday and there is no market for other goods.</p>

<p>Yesterday, there was a large amount of Mac White coal powder making sales on the market, totaling more than 800 tons, of which 500 tons were bought by a coal briquette factory in Hudong at a price of 8 taels and 6 qian. Customer purchases of Hongqi powder were relatively frequent, and transactions were good, priced at 9 taels and 2 qian 5 fen. Liujiang coal powder was also more active than last week, priced at 5 taels and a half.</p>

<h3 id="e218">Resistance <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— A Sheep</p>
<p>Everyone says... [the Chinese people have little resistance]. Judging from the September 18th Incident, this may be true to some extent, but the facts cannot be completely ignored. It should be known that resistance exists where it is possible. Let us not talk about the spirit of resistance of the 19th Route Army and the Northeast Volunteers who have suffered for a year, but just talk about recent events in our country, which are enough to prove the general resistance of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>First, there was the dispute between the two Chens in Guangdong, with the magnificent spirit of mutual resistance, such as airplanes sinking the Feiying warship. Then, there was the recently resolved battle between Han and Liu in Shandong, with thousands of cannons fired in a single day and the resolute spirit of attacking and defending to the death. In addition, there is the ongoing conflict between the two Lius in Sichuan. These can all be regarded as outstanding examples of resistance.</p>
<p>Putting aside the resistance of national soldiers (?), let's look at the resistance of the people. There are plenty of examples here...</p>
<p>Wasn't the economic boycott a big deal after September 18th? Then there was the January 28th Incident, which further aroused people's emotions. During this period, the economic boycott did have a good effect. However, after the agreement was signed, some people secretly engaged in trade, which slightly revealed their ability to resist. Therefore, patriotic groups issued warnings. Although they were formally hidden, they were still very active underneath, which is a further manifestation of resistance. And now? The power of patriotic groups seems insufficient to deter them. They simply shout and yell and engage in trade, further invigorating their resistance. Don't you see news in the newspapers these days about "[inferior goods entering in large quantities]," "[goods arriving in crowds]," and "[Japanese shipping resuming]"? Serious national crisis is not enough to awaken their conscience, and the warnings of patriotic comrades cannot deter them. The indomitable spirit of selling my goods and buying my goods is not a full expression of resistance?!</p>
<p>Apart from this, let's talk about a corner of society. What about the resistance there?</p>
<p>In places where urination is prohibited, no matter how strict the warning is, "[those who violate will be sent to the authorities and severely punished without leniency]," and even drawing turtles or using the most extreme curses, people still urinate disrespectfully and recklessly. After putting up sputum containers and writing "no spitting," the sputum containers become decorations, and people spit everywhere. All these indicate the resistance of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>Huh! Who says the Chinese people have no resistance?</p>

<p>— Wu Tiansheng</p>
<p>Each has their own poverty and sorrow, and refuses to rest. Together, we face urgent difficulties in the ancient southern state. Who understands the broken family and pities the chickens and dogs? In the end, the road leads to bearing the burden of horses and cattle. It's hard to know whether to cry or laugh, gazing at each other silently. Throughout the ages, it's a lonely sight. There's nothing left to do in this world, so let a bit of green mountain pierce the white head.</p>
<h3 id="e220">Feelings on Current Events <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Mo Ke</p>
<p>Looking at my reflection in the mirror, I sigh, "Alas!" Whose help can I rely on in this declining world? Showing love for talent only leads to axes that chop branches. Bringing food still startles the crows that feed their parents. The west wind sweeps across the land, drying up the bones of ten thousand people. The fires of Qin cover the sky, restoring the practices of the scholars. If Heaven's will and human affairs are truly like this, then let's drink a hundred jugs of Qingzhou wine.</p>
<p>Science</p>
<h3 id="e221">Alum <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Gu Lvshuang</p>
<p>Alum is a general term for a class of compounds, a double salt composed of one part metal sulfate and one part trivalent metal sulfate. Because of the different components, there are potassium aluminum alum, ammonium aluminum alum, potassium chromium alum, and so on. The alum we ordinary people refer to is potassium aluminum alum, which contains one molecule of potassium sulfate, one molecule of aluminum sulfate, and twenty-four molecules of water. This article refers specifically to this common alum. This substance is extracted from a mineral called alunite. The alunite is heated, and the soluble part is extracted with water to obtain alum crystals. The largest producers in the world are Rome and Hungary.</p>
<p>Alum is used for water purification, not only in mainland households, but also in water plants in large cities, where it is used as the first step in the water purification process. Please first describe the chemical principle of its water purification, which is also a common knowledge.</p>
<p>The composition of alum is as described above. Among them, aluminum sulfate, after entering the water, encounters the inherent carbonic acid or carbonates in the water, and is transformed into aluminum bicarbonate. This substance is hydrolyzed to form aluminum hydroxide, and the water purification effect is based on the formation of the latter.</p>
<p>When aluminum hydroxide is formed, it first becomes a colloid, suspended on the water surface, and gradually forms a colloidal precipitate. When this precipitate settles, it carries away all the fine particles in the water, such as bacteria and mud particles, and the water becomes clean. However, bacteria cannot be completely removed, so water purified with alum cannot be drunk raw and must be boiled again. This is something we often misunderstand, and unknowingly suffer from.</p>
<p>In medicine, alum is used as an astringent and has a wide range of uses. In the past, it was also used internally to stop diarrhea and bleeding. Today, it is mostly used externally. The most common use is as a gargle with a 0.5% to 1% aqueous solution, which is very effective for tonsillitis (commonly known as enlarged tonsils). Or, the powder can be blown into the nose and throat to treat inflammation of the nose and throat. There is some reason for rural folk to sprinkle the powder on rotten sores on the hands and feet. Also, alum mixed with vinegar has a disinfecting and swelling-reducing effect and can remove all nameless swellings.</p>
<p>There are many types of fermentation powder, all of which are made by combining baking soda and a substance that causes the baking soda to release carbon dioxide. Alum can also be combined with baking soda to make a fermentation powder, called alum fermentation powder. Its chemical action is too complex to be discussed here.</p>
<p>This substance can also be used to make fireproof cloth. Its crystals attached to the fabric are easily dissolved, and this dissolved substance can prevent the fibers from coming into contact with air, thus having a fire-resistant effect.</p>
<p>The aluminum acetate solution obtained by the reaction of alum and acetic acid can be used to make waterproof cloth. The method is to immerse the cloth in this solution and then put it in a steam box, where the aluminum acetate hydrolyzes to produce aluminum hydroxide. This substance attaches to the pores of the fibers, making them water-repellent.</p>
<p>Alum is something we regard as worthless, but who knows that this worthless thing has such great uses? Therefore, I have listed a few to provide for the readers of this publication.</p>
<h3 id="e222">Sketches of Student Life <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Bing</p>
<p>I have been away from student life for a whole year. Sometimes it makes me nostalgic with memories! Sometimes it makes me curse and scold! Who doesn't say that... student life is everyone's golden age. A rosy, comfortable life/Yes. Absolutely right, but unfortunately, most people have drifted through it in a dream. At least, that's how I feel. And repent! Friends, this is not me intentionally slandering our own people!</p>
<p>To be romantic is to be a notable figure. So, when snowflakes are flying and wind and rain are raging, wearing only a thin, long gown and dragging on slippers, or even enslaved Guangdong wooden clogs, with a hat tilted sideways, shivering and pacing into the classroom is the style of a scholar. This attracts attention and makes female classmates smile. Sometimes the clothes are indeed beautiful, but the dirty clothes that have been taken off are too lazy to ask the servant to wash. One by one, they are stuffed under the bed. Over time, the filth fills the dormitory and makes people sick. After paying for meals, sometimes I don't feel like eating my fill. Anyway, when my stomach is hungry, there are plenty of restaurants at the door selling fried noodles, wontons, and noodle soup, which are all quite filling. One or two bowls fill the stomach, the account is written in the book, and with books in hand, I turn around and skip away. This also provides extra income for many vendors.</p>
<p>Saying that modern students don't work hard is a bit unfair! When going to the toilet, which student squatting on the toilet doesn't hold a book in their hand and read diligently? When attending a memorial week or listening to a scholar's lecture, who doesn't carry a book, listening to the lecture while reading their book, or even placing a book on the table while eating? Aren't these manifestations of hard work? Heaven knows!</p>
<p>It is natural to boycott bad teachers. But in fact, the degree of a teacher is not the only standard for boycotting. If a teacher is too strict, doesn't allow leniency in exams, or forbids reading love letters and flirting in class, then he should be careful. Students will not only say that he has poor eloquence, but will also criticize the lecture notes he compiled for being incomprehensible, and even slander his character! Hooking up with female classmates is even worse. You can only roll up your bedding and run away. It's truly a wrong! When there is turmoil in the school or chaos in the country, everyone is extremely happy. Emotions rush in, reason is thrown aside, and there is a blind commotion. An anonymous leaflet is posted. Anyway, there is plenty of free time, and some take advantage of this free time to snuggle in the arms of their lovers. Donating to the Northeast Volunteer Army? Performing plays to raise money for disaster relief? That is just a convenient add-on. Why bother being so busy? The school's schedule can be changed at will. The sun is high in the sky, and it's time for class, but I'm still snoring in bed. After the lights go out at night, I light a candle. When the training director comes to check, I cover it with paper. When asked why I'm doing this day and night, I'll give a whole set of reasons. The only purpose of entering school is naturally to attend classes and listen to lectures to gain some knowledge for life. But in fact, most students don't like to attend classes. Being late and leaving early is still a good phenomenon. Some simply run away after roll call, and some simply ask someone to represent them. When the exam is approaching, being able to cram the night before is still a good phenomenon. Some are still snuggling with their lovers in the girls' dormitory or indulging in the cinema. Fortunately, during the exam, not only can you [cheat], but the teachers are also understanding and provide detailed explanations and hint at flipping through books.</p>
<p>This seems too harsh, but I feel that these are just a few outstanding examples. Try to open our eyes and see. Isn't the reality displayed like this? I can't help but put down my pen and sigh again.</p>
<h3 id="e223">Disappearance <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Ping</p>
<p>Before dawn, the dew soaks the ankles. Farmers working in the fields can no longer linger in warm beds. They get up early to prepare their farm tools and go to the fields. Even Sister Zhao, who herds ducks, carries a willow branch and follows behind a flock of ducks, singing mountain songs like "Private Love" while skipping and running.</p>
<p>Sister Zhao was already sixteen years old when spring came. She drives the ducks out every morning and drives them back in the evening. Her daily life is like this. She knows no sorrow or worry. The ducks enjoy the water in the river, and she lies on the grass by the riverbank, looking at the blue sky and watching the white clouds, imagining whatever she wants. Sometimes she plays chess with the cowherd riding on the ox, wading through the water. She does everything and does it willfully.</p>
<p>But today, a special emotion has arisen in our Sister Zhao. She drags the willow branch and is too lazy to follow the ducks. The spring breeze blows her temples, and she seems to shake her head without paying attention. She is completely calculating the words that Lin Sheng, the young master of the duck's home, said to her. She inadvertently misses a riverbank and casually drives the ducks down to the river beach. She secretly takes out a book that Lin Sheng stuffed into her small pocket. The cover depicts a beautiful princess. She reads a few pages, understanding but not fully understanding. It seems like a prince is proposing to a princess, etc. It is somewhat similar to what Lin Sheng said to her. Suddenly, two red clouds fly onto the tips of her cheeks. She leans over and sees her reflection in the river. She is indeed as beautiful as a princess [Lin Sheng's words are correct, I don't look like a villager].</p>
<p>She thinks that the sky seems to be transforming into a bustling city, like the Shanghai she dreams of. Lin Sheng said that Shanghai has cars, electric lights, and beautiful women. Since Lin Sheng loves me, I will go to Shanghai with him. He will not deceive me. Thinking of this, she is embarrassed to think further. The joy and fear that a mature virgin should have are intertwined with a self-conscious smile.</p>
<p>Suddenly, her eyes are covered by a hand reaching from behind. She feels insulted and curses, "Ah Gou!" Ah Gou, who plays chess with her every day, didn't expect Sister Zhao to scold him today, and walks away dejectedly. Sister Zhao's inexplicable feelings win out in her heart. After a long, long time, Sister Zhao drives the ducks back home. The master, Liu Laosan, says gently, "Sister Zhao, you've worked hard." Hearing this sentence that she is used to hearing every day, Sister Zhao feels today as if Liu Laosan is hiding another meaning. She sees him sneaking to the back door to meet Lin Sheng and whispering for a long time. Only then does Sister Zhao skip home.</p>
<p>Before dawn, the dew soaks the ankles. Sister Zhao's mother discovers that her daughter has not gotten up at this time. She scolds a few times but gets no response. She searches in the firewood room and finds only an empty quilt. So, she and her old man search everywhere. They run to Liu Laosan's house, but his son is also gone. The old couple are furious and retreat lightly.</p>
<p>Before noon, the news of Lin Sheng and Sister Zhao's disappearance has spread throughout the village.</p>
<h3 id="e224">A Page from a Diary <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Xiaoxue</p>
<p>If you can pay attention to what you encounter every day, you will definitely get many valuable materials of various colors. If you record them well, it will become a very valuable collection of thoughts. So, I feel that articles like diaries are indispensable.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I returned to Zhenru from Shanghai and experienced a memorable event on bus number three. At that time, the bus was very crowded. From Baoshan Road to the Sun Temple, I hardly had a moment to relax. The car was shaking so badly that I was suffocating. When we arrived at the Sun Temple, the car became less crowded because some passengers got off. At this time, there was a villager who had a salted fish in his hand. He carelessly pulled the rope tied to the salted fish, letting it move east and west around the passengers. So, a round of unfavorable comments began...</p>
<p>"You are Chinese, why do you want to eat this kind of fish?" said A.</p>
<p>"Our own fresh fish tastes very good. Why do you want to buy this kind of salted fish?" said B.</p>
<p>"Not eating this kind of fish doesn't mean you can't live well!" said C.</p>
<p>"We Chinese are really too disappointing, so the country has become like this... The officials only know how to squeeze the people, and the businessmen only know how to sell enemy goods. We certainly can't tolerate those who squeeze the people now. As for those who sell enemy goods, as long as we don't buy them, they will suffer..." said D.</p>
<p>In this way, one sentence after another, they made the villager blush with shame. He remained silent and did not say a word. He seemed very ashamed and remorseful.</p>
<p>At this time, I felt very strange. Such nationalistic remarks actually came from the mouths of those petty workers in the clothes of ordinary citizens. Who says China is beyond salvation? The people filled with national consciousness make up the majority of China's 400 million people. If the ruling class could make good use of the people and use the power of the people to deal with the enemy's invasion, wouldn't that be a good way?</p>
<p>When the car arrived at Gujiazhai, the villager holding a foreign fish got off. Everyone in the car turned their heads to look at the villager's back. The car continued to move forward, and the villager's back disappeared along with it.</p>

<p>— Binghui</p>
<p>At about nine o'clock in the morning, the streetcar is the most crowded. Every day, at this time, I can find many familiar faces in the car. Among them, the most eye-catching are a pot-bellied, round-faced, big-nosed man with a civilized beard and a small hat, and a short man with a pointed head, small eyes, and an old blue serge suit who never wears a tie. One tall and one short, both around forty years old, they look very funny. Every time I meet them, they are always together. They can truly be said to be a naturally funny pair. They are quite talented in public speaking and seem to have very deep and broad life experiences. They often gesticulate wildly and talk loudly about wonderful and strange things that make people laugh until their stomachs hurt.</p>
<p>This time, when the car drove to Tibet Road, there was suddenly a majestic and loud military band and singing on the road. There was a slight stir in the car. The car stopped... People's heads stretched out of the car window, looking with surprised and solemn eyes. The short man grabbed my sleeve and shouted for me to look quickly. By the time I squeezed to the window from the crowd, the car had already started moving. I only saw the backs of a group of people moving towards Nichengqiao to the north. It turned out to be the American young master soldiers, the mortar team. The pot-bellied man grabbed this point and began to make comments...</p>
<p>"The American soldiers are so mighty, their military appearance is so neat! I said that those young students who don't know the times shout every day that they want to fight imperialism. Do you think those Chinese soldiers, who are even worse than beggars, can fight these powerful and majestic foreign soldiers? Haha... What a joke..."</p>
<p>"If there really is a fight," the short man naturally chimed in, "as long as the Chinese soldiers look at the shadows of these foreign soldiers, they will be scared and run away! Listen to the military songs they sing. Hearing them makes the hairs on my head stand on end. They are so solemn and terrifying..."</p>
<p>These words struck my eardrums, and the flames of anger in my heart burned. My blood was boiling! I couldn't wait to punch these shameless, cold-blooded things to death. But I was too cowardly and only put my sweaty fists in my pocket. I never had the courage to wave it in front of this villain's face. Shame!</p>
<p>The ball field has arrived... I walked with a lost soul, dejected and dragging a broken heart, all the way into this dark office.</p>

<p>— Guo Boliang</p>
<p>Acute convulsions belong to heat, chronic convulsions belong to cold. Infants under one year old are the most difficult to care for. If there is no fixed time for breastfeeding, it will lead to inconsistent fullness and hunger, or excessive love and frequent teasing, or excessive warmth. All these things can cause the danger of infantile convulsions. Infants are purely Yang in constitution. Their internal organs are not fully developed, and their Qi and blood are insufficient. Once they are sick, whether from external or internal causes, their body fluids will be damaged.</p>
<p>If they catch wind and evil, their body heat does not subside, and they show symptoms such as crying without tears, a blue face, and a dry nose, the internal body fluids have been damaged. The convulsions will begin with symptoms of high fever and red face, confused consciousness, twitching hands and feet, back arching, staring eyes, clenched teeth, and rising phlegm and shortness of breath. This type of convulsion is called acute convulsion.</p>
<p>If there is no cold or heat, the back suddenly arches, the limbs twitch, the stool appears blue-white, phlegm rises, and the breath is short and the corners of the mouth are crooked, this type of convulsion is called chronic convulsion.</p>
<p>There are also cases where acute and chronic convulsions occur simultaneously. However, it is necessary to observe the number of symptoms of acute and chronic convulsions before determining whether it is a heat or cold syndrome. Generally, acute convulsions belong to heat, and chronic convulsions belong to cold. Acute convulsions are mostly due to liver heat, and chronic convulsions are mostly due to spleen cold. The treatment for acute convulsions should focus on clearing heat, resolving phlegm, extinguishing wind, and generating body fluids. The treatment for chronic convulsions should focus on warming and invigorating the middle, and resolving phlegm. Therefore, when you see a child is sick, do not panic. First, examine whether it is cold or heat, and then consult a doctor for diagnosis and treatment. Do not blindly believe in witchcraft. Unfortunately, parents all over the world, when they see a child suffering from convulsions, are invariably panicked and at a loss. Some seek witchcraft, some seek miraculous prescriptions, and all kinds of methods are mixed up, resulting in the child's death, which is truly sad.</p>
<h3 id="e228">Scrofula of the Neck <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>There is a saying that sores, no matter how big or small, are good when pus comes out. This refers to local surgery. In the case of scrofula, those that have not broken and ulcerated can still be expected to dissipate. Those that have broken and discharged pus and want to heal are rarely seen. It must be known that scrofula is a systemic disease. It cannot be concluded as a local surgical problem simply because there are cervical lymph node tuberculosis without any pain. Those who do not understand medical knowledge often think that it is a minor local problem and do not care about it. They often use European methods to dig it out or use proven prescriptions to apply mercury plasters. Therefore, it is often seen that although scrofula is removed, the internal toxins are not completely eliminated, and it recurs again and again, leading to death. This journal, in order to seek happiness for society, must tell you in detail.</p>
<p>The neck is where the lymph nodes are concentrated. The function of the lymph nodes is to eliminate pathogens. Congenital hereditary tuberculosis and syphilis are contained in the whole body due to bloodline relationships. Scrofula occurs when the lymph nodes lose their ability to kill bacteria and instead become tuberculous and swollen. The "Su Wen" calls scrofula "mouse fistula." Later generations of prescription books believed that scrofula was caused by accidentally eating food gnawed by rats, which is actually speculation. The "Su Wen" refers to broken and ulcerated ones as "mouse fistula." The "Ling Shu" says that those that have ulcerated are fistulas, and those that have not ulcerated are scrofula. This disease is more common in young and strong people and less common in the elderly. Examining the cause, it is generally nothing more than the poison inherited from parents.</p>
<p>In the early stage of scrofula, the nodules are the size of beans or like peach pits or chestnuts, in clusters of four or five, and often connected to the root of the ear and to the supraclavicular fossa, or from left to right, or from right to left. Mild scrofula can be pinched and pushed up and down, left and right, and moved freely. Over time, they gradually enlarge and cannot be pushed. After half a year or a year or two, they will break and discharge pus. Before breaking, they must be soft and the color does not change, or there may be slight pain, but it is often painless. Those due to congenital tuberculosis have thin and clear pus that flows continuously. Those due to hereditary syphilis have turbid and thick pus and have an odor.</p>
<p>The above is true scrofula. There is also a kind of pseudo-scrofula. For example, throat disease, cough, childhood smallpox, measles. Although the underlying disease is cured, the nodules in the neck and under the jaw often resemble scrofula and do not dissipate for a long time. Do not mistake them for scrofula. After the illness, the healthy Qi has not recovered and the toxins have not been exhausted. When the body becomes stronger, it can dissipate on its own. Those that are delayed for a long time must also consult a doctor for diagnosis and treatment to avoid inducing other diseases.</p>
<p>Some cases of scrofula are easy to cure, some are difficult to cure, and some are ineffective even with treatment. These questions are of the greatest concern to patients. It is not difficult to solve this problem. Just understand its truth.</p>

<p>Causes of Vomiting Blood</p>
<p>The blood in the human body circulates through the vessels, flowing up and down in a continuous cycle. Outwardly, it reaches the skin, and inwardly, it connects to the internal organs. In a healthy person, the circulation is unobstructed. Conversely, there will be illness. But what blood relies on is the vessels, and what the vessels rely on is Qi. Blood flows through the vessels because of Qi, and the vessels are strengthened because of Qi. This blood circulation can follow Qi to flow and not lose its normal course. If a vessel is stimulated, the blood in the vessel will inevitably rupture and overflow. If Qi can fully maintain the blood vessels, then the blood in the vessel will naturally not overflow. Otherwise, if Qi is deficient and cannot maintain the blood vessels, the blood in the vessel may overflow on its own even without stimulation. Examining the causes of blood overflowing outside the vessels due to stimulation, one is due to stimulation, and the other is due to Qi not being able to maintain the blood vessels. The former belongs to the real syndrome, and the latter belongs to the false syndrome. Although they are both vomiting blood, the symptoms are very different. In short, vomiting blood due to stimulation is due to fire forcing the blood to rise, and vomiting blood due to Qi deficiency is due to insufficient Qi that cannot control the blood.</p>
<p>Vomiting Blood Due to Stimulation</p>
<p>Vomiting blood due to stimulation includes injury to the liver after great anger, which is commonly referred to as anger injuring the liver. After great anger, the liver immediately expands, and liver fire follows. The liver is the place where blood is stored. Once liver fire is strong, the fire will boil the blood vessels. The liver governs Qi, and if Qi rises, it cannot control the blood. The blood rises with the Qi, and the blood vessels are broken by the fire and overflow. This is one type of vomiting blood due to stimulation. There is also vomiting blood due to a harsh environment. People in harsh environments must have more thoughts, worries, and sorrows than ordinary people, and they are depressed and unhappy all day long. Examining the source of the disease, it is also due to the liver. All the emotional disturbances in life are managed by the liver. Therefore, those with emotional depression are more likely to suffer from this disease. There are also those who vomit blood after being greatly shocked. After the shock, the blood boils, and the transport of Qi and blood vessels remains the same, blocked and stagnant, causing the blood vessels to tighten or run horizontally and reversely, resulting in vomiting blood that cannot be stopped. The situation is extremely dangerous when the symptoms occur, with the appearance of not being able to live to the next day. However, if the vomiting due to shock is not related to the heart meridian, it is easier to treat than vomiting due to shock related to the emotions. Being unrelated to the heart meridian means that the shock is sudden, and although there is temporary shock, there is not much pain or itching in the heart meridian after the matter is over. This type of vomiting blood is easier to treat. Vomiting blood due to shock related to the emotions refers to the shock that comes as something that should happen in psychological fantasy and panic, and is suddenly related to one's own personal interests. After the matter is over, one cannot calmly forget it. This type of vomiting blood is more difficult to treat, because if the shock is too severe and the network vessels rupture, and emotions are depressed afterwards, Qi is injured again. When Qi rises, the blood will overflow from the broken blood vessels from time to time, so it is difficult to treat. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Answered by Ding Jihua</p>
<p>Dry Cough</p>
<p>Mr. Du Haoen wrote to me saying that I returned from a social engagement at the end of last month. Suddenly, I had a cough and my throat was very dry. After coughing for a long time, I finally had a small amount of phlegm, which was very dark in color. The illness is not serious, but my uncle has had lung disease for two years. Is it contagious pulmonary tuberculosis or just a common cough? I would like to get a proper treatment to relieve my worries.</p>
<p>Answer: Coughing up phlegm that is not smooth and always feeling dry in the throat is called a dry cough. The lung is a delicate organ that is responsible for clearing and cleaning. Dryness attacks the lung, and the lung fluid does not moisten the stagnated heat, which remains in the lung network, resulting in unfavorable breathing and coughing due to Qi rising in reverse. This symptom is caused by dry weather and is not pulmonary tuberculosis. There is no need to worry, but patients often do not pay much attention when the cough first starts. One must know that even if the initial cough is not tuberculosis, it is always due to lung disease. A lung cough that does not heal can lead to tuberculosis over time. Therefore, although a dry cough is a minor illness, one must be careful. I have attached a prescription below. Take it warm in the evening. All tobacco, alcohol, and other items must also be avoided.</p>
<p>Two mace of frost leaves, two mace of peeled apricot kernels, eight fen of cicada slough, one and a half mace of snakegourd peel, two mace of fritillary bulb, two mace of large ophiopogon root, three loquat leaves.</p>
<p>Malaria Mother - Mr. Yu Jiayun wrote to me saying that my mother is over sixty years old and has a history of coughing and vomiting blood. It recurs from time to time. It has been going on for two or three years. In August of this year, it recurred several times, vomiting blood. A month later, she had chills and fever again, which caused her to be bedridden. The chills and fever came like malaria. The fever was so severe that she was unconscious. After lying in bed for more than a month, the chills and fever stopped. Suddenly, she had abdominal pain that was unbearable. After two or three days, her abdomen gradually became enlarged and the pain stopped. However, her abdomen was distended like a drum, which was worse after eating. There was also a mass inside. The condition changed several times, and treatment was difficult. I dare to ask for a treatment. I would be very grateful.</p>
<p>Answer: Your mother's abdominal distension is due to malaria. This is a malaria mother and not drum distension. The cause of malaria is the feeling of seasonal evil that obstructs phlegm and stagnation. After malaria, the phlegm stagnation does not resolve, and the liver and spleen Qi mechanism is not harmonious. There is often abdominal pain and distension. Your mother has a history of coughing and vomiting blood. Qi and Yin deficiency makes adjustment and treatment difficult. Now I plan to use the Guangji Ao Jia Decoction to treat it. Maybe it can turn danger into safety.</p>
<p>Eight fen of stir-fried tortoise shell, eight fen of peony root, eight fen of immature orange, three mace of codonopsis, five fen of chebulae peel, five fen of raw rhubarb, four fen of tangerine peel, two fen of cassia bark.</p>
<p>Grind the right medicine into honey pills the size of a parasol tree seed. Take twenty pills daily with boiled water, or decoct and take it.</p>

<h3 id="e231">Cold <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>The weather in winter is cold and easy to catch a cold. In severe cases, the nose is blocked, there is a lot of phlegm, and the voice is not clear, which easily causes early lung disease. For treatment, decoct three mace of ephedra with water and smell it between the nostrils. It can heal on its own.</p>
<h3 id="e232">囗Low Back Pain <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>The waist bones often feel sore and painful, especially in women and the elderly. This symptom is mostly due to deficiency of both the liver and kidneys, and damp heat remains in the network channels. Long-term consumption of black fungus and teasel meat can cure it.</p>
<h3 id="e233">囗Red Streak Phlebitis <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>This symptom is particularly dangerous. If it grows on the toes or back of the foot, and the red streaks reach the navel, it is incurable. If it grows on the fingers or back of the hand, and the red streaks reach the heart and chest, it is incurable. If it grows on the lips, and the red streaks reach the throat, it is incurable. There is a saying that "looking at phlebitis on a galloping horse" refers to red streak phlebitis. Anyone suffering from red streak phlebitis, whether on the hand or foot, can apply red plaster to dissolve it. This plaster is sold in all major pharmacies.</p>
