<h3 id="c1">論對蘇復交與防遏共産彬 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>我國自民十六十二月明令撤銷蘇聨領事。承認取締蘇聨在華國營商業機關。停止其在華營業。繼復於民十八以中東鐵路交涉之惡化。正式宣告斷絶國交以來。國人談及蘇聨。類都視爲洪水猛獸。不可親近。於是對於蘇聨一切。遂摒置不敢談。不願談。三四年來。中蘇之間。除莫德惠氏滯留莫斯科進行中東鐵路之談判而外。幾無其他關係可言。迨去年九一八禍變突發。外交情勢。頓形險惡。於是乃漸有人主張中蘇復交。以謀打破當前外交上之艱局。在二中全會中。曾有人正式提議。前外交部長陳友仁氏主張尤力。中委孫科氏上月二十五日發表談話。亦曾謂應以聨合世界上以平等待我之民族。及廢除不平等條約。求得中國民族之獨立爲基本原則。并謂目下我國外交孤立無援。柔弱無能。蓋已至極。欲達到澈底抗日之目的。必先覓取友邦。而當前可與我國携手者有二。一爲美國。一即蘇聨。其主張對蘇復交。持之亦堅。即現外交部長羅文幹氏。於本月二日發表談話。亦承認邇來中蘇恢復邦交。聲浪日高。並表示政府對此問題。尚在熟籌。末更言倘有人以中蘇復交後。共産隠患。更將滋蔓。余意中蘇復交。並非接受或同意於共産主義。綜合上述各種消息而觀。並證之以上月政府正式准許蘇聨通訊機關塔斯通訊社在我國内設立之事。則中蘇恢復邦交。殆已在積極醖釀之中。吾人亦認爲對蘇復交。今已實不容緩。深盼政府當機立斷。毋再躊躇。　　夫我國之所以對蘇絶交。及一般人之所以反對或懷疑於對蘇復交者。其唯一之理由。不爲蘇聨援助中國共産黨并煽起中國共産革命乎。吾人認爲此種顧慮。自其表面視之。固似言之成理。但有稍加思索。則不能不認爲一種過慮。或且爲一種短見。　　何以言之。蘇聨爲今日唯一之社會主義國家。其嶄新之政體與制度。及其蒂煽動性之宣傳。在資本主義已登峯造極。階級分化已十分顯明之今日。固頗足以激起一般下層羣衆之感情。若中蘇一旦復交。則適予共黨以宣傳上之便利。此點吾人誠不能不加注意。然而吾人認對蘇復交爲一事。而防遏共黨宣傳。則又爲一事。誠如羅文幹所言。中蘇復交。並非接受或同意於共産主義。邦交儘可恢復。而共産宣傳。固亦可以正當之手段。交涉制止。此兩事不能併爲一談。蓋極顯而易見。譬如德意志與土耳其。都與蘇邦交綦密。然而德土固未共産化也。且適以聨蘇而得打破其外交上之艱局。由是可知但使應付得宜。則對蘇復交固不必有受其煽動之虞也。　　抑又進者。共産主義之發生。絶非由於有蘇聨之存在。脱共産主義可以與蘇絶交而遏止。則蘇聨之本身。又究何由而産生耶。沙俄又究何由而推翻耶。我國今日之眞患。不在於共産主義之煽動。而在於共産主義發生之原因。四月十八日大美晚報論（眞正之大患。）曾云。（共産主義和别的生物一樣。祗有特别相宜於這種子生長之泥土。才能開花它是在不公道的壓迫及不滿足的泥土裏養成的。搗亂分子及狂熱者。當然可以贊助共産主義的生長。但他們不能使共産主義發生在快樂繁榮的區域裏。他們的宣傳。是不能剌入人們耳鼓的。）此種見解。最爲精闢。吾人今日不問我國内之政治何如。人民之生計何如是否有足以養成共産主義之泥土。是否有受共産主義煽動之機會。而徒以對蘇絶交。甚且摒棄蘇聨之一切而不談即以爲足以防遏共産。是眞爲捨本逐末。我國與蘇絶交。今且四年矣。然而國内之共産黨。并不因而絶跡者。抑又何耶。嚮使我國内政治清明。民生安定。則蟲不生於不腐之水。吾人固何憂乎共産主義之煽惑。以故吾人認彼持顧慮蘇聨煽起中國革命爲理由而反對中蘇復交者。非爲過慮。即爲短識。　　吾人力主中蘇立即恢復邦交。其理由容其續論。</p>

<p>見王造時　　批評汪精衛于右任兩氏的言論　　自從有一部分被邀的國難會員，提出結束黨治，實施民治的主張以後，於是訓政與憲政問題，漸引起社會上深切的注意。國民黨領袖，如汪精衛，胡漢民，孫科，于右任諸氏，都有意見發表。汪于兩氏是反對結束訓政的；孫氏是贊成結束訓政的。，胡氏則態度很欠明瞭。我是研究政治並且是主張結束訓政實行憲政的人，對於這個重要問題，不能不貢獻一點愚見。　　按汪于兩氏反對結束訓政的理由，分析出來有四··（一）認爲中國人民程度太低，非經過國民黨的訓政，不能運用民主政治，實行憲政；（二）認爲没有國民黨，便没有中華民國；而破壞訓政，便是破壞國民黨；破壞國民黨，便是破壞中華民國；（三）過去的憲政，成績不好，所以現在不應實行憲政；（四）現在主張憲政的人，有些是從前的（官僚政客）；他們不配談黨政。　　先就反對結束訓政的第一個理由來討論：認爲中國人民程度太低，非經過國民黨的訓政，不能運用民主政治，實行憲政，這個理由，至少須建築在下列幾個基礎上，才能自圓其説。（一）國民黨本身健全；（二）國民黨的黨員。是全國的優秀份子；（三）國民黨過去很有成績。若是國民黨本身四分五裂，没有整個黨的組織，黨的意志，黨的方針；試問怎樣去（訓）？若是國民黨本身充滿了新舊官僚政客軍閥，不但不是全國的優秀，並且有許多是社會的敗類；試問又何以爲（訓）？若是訓政五年，（訓）到喪權辱國，内亂不已，土匪到處如麻，貪官遍國都是，國家瀕亡，民不聊生；試問再要這樣（訓）下去，如何得了？這些都是客觀的事實，不容諱言，也不能諱言的。國民黨能否訓政，應否繼續訓政，就看他是否具備上列三個條件；否則，國民黨就不配講訓政，就應該結束訓政。　　本來訓政的根本理論，是從（賢人政治）出發，應該由（賢者）去訓（不肖），由少數人去統治多數人。但是那些少數人是（賢者）？那些多數人是（不肖）？這是過去擁護貴族政體，今日主張訓政制度者所不能答覆的問題。貴族政體的理論失敗在此，訓政政體的理論失敗也在此。貴族政體是少數人操有政權，而大多國民没有參政機會的政治。所以今日國民黨的訓政，也可以説是貴族政體之一種方式。主張貴族政體的人，有些根據於血統，説應該由少數世襲的貴族，去統治多數的平民；但是貴族家裏的子弟，多是不懂世故的少爺公子。有些根據於財富，説應該由少數有資産的人，去統治多數無錢的人；但是富豪並不一定有政治能力。有些根據於智識，説應該由少數受過高等教育的人，去統治多數没有智識的人；但是智識階級有許多是書呆子。現在請問國民黨訓政式的貴族政體，是根據什麽來的？旣不是根據於血統，又不是根據於財富，也不是根據於教育，乃是名則根據於黨籍，實則附庸於軍閥。若説凡是國民黨員，便是賢者，便是全國優秀，便是先知先覺，便應做統治階級；若説凡不是國民黨員，便是不肖，便是後知後覺，便應做被治奴隸。這種（貴族）標準，未免太不合理。何况事實告訴我們，現在的國民黨員，有許多在人格，學問，才能，各方面，都不高明呢。　　上面是説國民黨不能（訓），不配（訓）的理由。就是假定國民黨能（訓），配（訓），政治歷史告訴我們，講訓政快不能講民主政治。第一，是理論上的不通。有了訓的統階級，及被訓的被統治階級，汪氏還要説能（培養民權），（人民的權力，在時間上是一天一天的增加，在空間上，是一天一天的擴大）這是騙人的話。民權的發展，是要自動的；若是被（訓）出來的，便不是民權了，翻開世界各國歷史，請問那國的民主政治，是統治者（訓）出來的？再請問那國的民主政治，不是人民爭得來的？第二，是事實上的不通，凡是拿到政權，居於統治地位的個人，或團體，總是不願意放手。這是人類普遍的天性。各國的政治歷史，都可證明。訓政學説，希望訓政的統治階級，訓練一般人民去奪取他們獨佔的政權，由訓政到憲政，那也是欺人之談。過去國民黨的訓政是怎樣；將來國民黨的訓政，大槪也是怎樣。不説别個，汪于兩氏便是第一個拿到政權不放手的。所以講訓政就不能講民主政治；講民主政治便不能不反對訓政。兩者不可得兼，請汪子兩氏自擇。　　反對結束訓政第二個理由，説是没有國民黨，便没有中華民國；而破壞訓政，便是破壞國民黨；破壞國民黨，便是破壞中華民國。這不但是不通的邏輯並且有意侮辱我全國人民。這不在且分開來説，先討論是否没有國民黨，便没有中華民國。中華民國的産生，是有許多原因促成的，如西洋文化的侵入，外患的壓迫，清廷的腐敗，工業革命的影響，這都是革命的根本原因。即就推翻滿清的統治而言，國民黨外還有許多個人或團體，都有功勞。現在汪于兩氏一筆抹煞，不是出於無知，便是故意誇大。大凡一國的革命，必有根本的原因；只要根本的條件成熟，革命的黨不過是適逢其會罷了。辛亥的革命，國民黨不幹，還有别人來幹。何况革滿清的命，不僅是國民黨一個團體在那裏做，更不是現在的國民黨在那裏做。倒袁之役，主要的力量還是蔡松坡他們，而不是國民黨。並且進一步來講，中華民國現在之頻於危亡，現在的國民黨員應負很大的責任。事到如今，强寇入室，執政的國民黨領袖如汪于兩氏，不向我全國國民告罪，還要在那襄説没有國民黨。便没有中華民國，那眞豈有此理！　　至於破壞訓政是否就是破壞國民黨，若是放眼看民主國家的政黨政治，便不難解答了。政黨並不一定要訓政，取消訓政並非取消訓政的黨。國民黨以前没有訓政，固然是黨；即使現在結束訓政，仍然是黨。我們之所以主張結束訓政，不過想取消國民黨壟斷政權的特殊地位而已。從一方面看來，不但不是破壞國民黨，並且是想保全國民黨的政治生命，免得被人家革命。　　説到破壞國民黨就是破壞中華民國，那更是笑話。中華民國不是國民黨的寄生物；反之，國民黨倒是中華民國的寄生物。國民黨消滅，中華民國不一定消滅；中華民國消滅，國民黨必然消滅。所謂（皮之不存，毛將焉附。）並且像國民黨近幾年來的幹法，對外喪權辱國，對内壓迫人民，黨高於國，有黨無國，即使到了萬不得已的時候，取銷國民黨的政權也未始不是擁護中華民國的辦法。（未完）　　招領如有走失男女者請注　　　　意此處地位社會局啟第一五八一號、女性、虞月香、寗波人、十二歲、民國二十年十月十八日、由滙司捕房送中國救濟婦孺會第一五八二號、男性、陸榮根、南京人、十二歲、民國二十年十月二十日、由老閘捕房送中國救濟婦孺會、第一五八三號、女性、徐丫頭、江北入、七歲民國二十年十月二十一日、由匯司捕房送中國救濟婦孺會教育消息</p>

<p>吾軍粤飛機師多神技。敵畏之如虎。某日接戰。敵以大型機擲彈。吾機見而逐北。凌其上。力壓之。敵機竟不能遯。迫於地上。俘得之。　　一日敵機擲彈。初脱手。吾軍飛槍擊之。適與相觸。機竟燬。若有天焉。非人力也。</p>

<p>近來滬上中央明星兩影院開映一國産有聲佳片。曰（舊時京華。）此劇名稱。觸入眼簾。不禁有感。蓋京華而云舊時者。自以異於今日之京華而言。然龍蟠虎踞之地之今日京華。事實上自滬變突作。國都遷洛以後。亦已非復今日之京華。近日中日協定業經簽訂。政府執政諸公。此後便可從容返斾。秦淮風月。重叙幽情。並使石頭城郭。依然保持首都莊嚴。否則日軍如果進逼不已。爲長期抵抗計。勢必更由洛陽行都。西安陪都。繼續西遷。終而至於喜瑪拉亞之巓。亦未可知。設使不幸生此。則所謂今日之京華者。不免亦以舊時京華名之矣。噫。</p>

<p>— 求幸福齋主人</p>
<p>第六回可憐同夢夜迫爲床下盟猶憶初戀時負卻窗約　　李問霞每向他催促。他只推托説待畢業後進行也不爲遲。惟暗中曾對伊頗。有經濟上的帮助。兩下也就因循過去。以至於等候出。今番這樣一個大變故梁笑雲慢慢聽完這段口供。略沈思了一晌。也不驚奇。也不忿怒。反從容問道。我聽明白了。現在我只切實的問你一句。旣又有了今晚我們這一段事。乾脆的你只有一條路可走。或是要李問霞或是要我。憑你的本心快對我説。安玉田毫不遲疑。把一個頭仍鑽到梁笑雲懷裏深深埋藏着。像小孩兒撒賴般吞吞吐吐地説道。我絶對的需要你。你就鬨我滾蛋也是不成的。不拘什麽嚴刑峻罰我都甘願受。梁笑雲輕輕把他推開冷笑着道。你不要裝腔。我還有正經的對你説呢。已前的我雖能寛恕。以後的我却不能半點放鬆。你若眞心要我。便休想含糊過去。仍作什麽兩全的打算。你想呀。李問霞能與我共嫁一夫。并屈居於我之下嗎。我或者尚可吃點虧。無奈在你我合作的事實上。我若不夠身分。不大好撒開手辦事。也仍是與你無益。没法子。我不能不對李問霞抱十二分的歉意。請你斬釘截鐵的取消那個口頭上的婚約罷。僅是一句空話。料想取消却也并不甚難。若再能開誠布公對伊説明這利害。伊是眞愛你的。或尚能原諒你這苦衷呢。我很盼望伊能想得開。并還想認伊做朋友。由我送伊一筆生活費。你能照這意思。當我的面寫一封信給伊嗎。安玉田縐着眉尖答道。也只好照你所説的那樣辦了。那封信這就寫嗎。梁笑雲笑道。明早寫也成。但不要愁眉苦臉的稍帶勉强。以免日後生懊悔。此刻趁早回絶我説不能辦。還來得及呢。安玉田忙伸手去堵住伊的櫻唇道。好了。不要説了。你若仍不信我。我可以下床去跪在當天發一個誓。笑梁雲按住他柔聲説道。不是我不信你。只因我還有更難的題目尚没説完。你就在縐眉毛了。教我如何能放心。但我决不要你發誓。我只限人明早把信寫好後。就一同上你那公庽去。將你的行李立時統搬到我這裏來。只留下那封信交公庽茶房遞給李問霞。從此我倆就算同居。一切行動都不能再瞞背我。比什麽穏妥的保障都强呢。這并非我太小氣。實在是套鎖住你這野馬。不能不這樣。依不依。你還得明白答復我一聲。</p>

<p>— 佛</p>
<p>蘇滬交通自一二八事變以後，陸路交通，完全斷絶，惟賴水道輪運通行，故先後兩個月中，刦輪重案，多至三十餘起，眞是駭人聽聞的事，而三十餘件的刦案中，最足惹人注意的，當推前次無錫孫楊兩家被刦約五六十萬元，此次蘇州某富翁，遷移回蘇，亦遭重大損失，數約四十餘萬元，此外較小的損失，天然不計其數，此原是匪徒幸運的蒞臨，亦是日人鐵騎的所賜，尚又何言。　　不過在無情砲火，連天震動，滿天鐵鳥，亂擲炸彈的時候，眞是苦了那一般的老百姓，不逃麽？或葬身火窟，或受奸淫擄掠的慘禍，不能不逃，逃難麽？有兩種人很是痛苦。　　到租界上去租房麽？無錢，住旅館麽？更是無錢，没有法子，祗有掮了舖蓋，提了破舊的應用的東西，朝幾個難民收容所去送，幾碗薄粥，幾根蘿卜乾，這原是最富於維他命Ｃ的一種衛生品，幾十家人家，硬塞在一間大屋裏，儘你們去受用，在這屋子裏的空氣，天然異常緊張，病的也有，獃的也有，走不動的也有，有哭的，有笑的，有哭笑不得的，這種嘈雜的聲浪，混亂的狀態，在特殊情勢之下，天然無法整理的，此外尚有幾位青年的童子軍，替你們把守門户，在外面看來，倒也規模宏大，這一種是無錢的苦。　　呌幾幾隻大船麽？不興，路上恐有危險，趁輪船麽？也是不興，恐怕幾位匪兄要來請教，但此外亦無辦法，不過輪船比較民船似乎安全一些，即使平日一些不肯通融的人，到了這時，亦祗有把一家的生命財産，或多或少，儘量地從輪船上送，不料手槍一聲，不好了！到那時也來不及了，早知如此，何必當初，幸而輪船上的危險，竟得安全過去，而租界上搶刦的案件，亦時有發生，若到了黄昏的時候，突然從後門中來了五六位朋友，袖出手槍，嚇禁聲張，到其時亦祇有惟命是從，無法擺布，這一種是有錢的苦。　　金錢萬能，是現代最時髦而最有效能的一句口號，但現在國家如此，社會如此，我祇有勸幾位有錢的先生們，不要再錙銖必較，惟利是圖，（得方便且方便），老實説句話，住在混亂狀態的社會裏，多一分財産，即多一分擔憂，無財産天然活不落性命，若使財産多了，亦是財産之累，不是財産之福，近日蘇滬道上，迭次發生這樣的巨刦案，我更感到謾藏誨盜，象齒焚身，金錢的勢力，不是萬能，實是萬惡。　　最乖的，天然要讓幾位大老先生了，平日在老百姓頭上拼命搜刮來的金錢，立刻從外國銀行裏去送，看了形勢不對。就借了一個考察。游歷。或求學的頭銜，一溜烟去做外國的寓公，這是何等寫意而見機的事情呢，唉！</p>

<p>— 區蔭</p>
<p>中國向來是世界絲織品的供給者，近因我國對於絲茶，不肯改良的緣故，大有一落千丈之勢，同時外國人造絲之輸入，又日增一日，市上時行的絲襪，絲襯。絲巾之類，十九皆是人造絲織品，我恐國人中多有不一知人造絲爲何物者，特在此把牠的來源，介紹一下，天然絲是一種蛋白質，燒之有臭，且留炭骸，人造絲是用從木料所造的纖維質造成，燒之有焰無臭，不留炭骸，光澤過於天然絲，而堅固耐久則不及，造法有以下四種：　　（一）用比重一·四二之粗製硝酸四百格，與比重一·八三三之濃硫酸一千格，徐徐混和，冷至攝氏二十度時，投入已經製成之潔白纖維質或棉花五十五格，在十五度至二十度間，浸二十四小時，取出滴乾，用清水洗凈·在二十五度氣温中放乾，即成硝化纖維質，再將此硝化纖維溶於四十分無水酒精與六十分以脱Ether的混和液内，（如不溶，則非浸在硝硫酸内過久，或硝硫酸太濃，已成爲三硝基纖維質。棉花火藥，即係硝硫酸太淡，浸的時間太短僅成爲一硝基纖維質之故，）將此溶液置諸罐内，下穿無數小如針尖之孔，自上加以壓力，纎維質溶液即成絲狀，自下射出，同時使内含之溶劑，在流動高温空氣内自行揮發，或直接射入水内，使酒精以脱爲水吸收，纎維質即成爲絲，但此絲内尚含有兩個硝基NO２，如不取出，最易着火，或炸焚，須再用酸性硫化，鈉液NaSH或酸性硫化錏液NH4SH等還原劑，將兩個NO2取出，即無絲襪在跳舞場爆炸的危險，　　（二）Schweizer'sSolution加鹼類於硫酸銅ＣuSO4溶液内，生二氫氧化銅Cu（ＯＨ）２，將此暫出溶於亞莫尼亞濃液内，成Ｃu（ＮＨ３）４（ＯＨ）２的藍色液體，此液能溶化纎維質，用此溶有纎維質液，如上法從小孔壓於稀硫酸内，纎維復成絲狀，還原而出，　　（三）溶纎維質於二硫化炭ＣＳ２與苛性鈉之混合液内，將此溶有纎維質的溶體如第二法，變化經過的化學式如下，（Ｃ６Ｈi</p>
<p>oO５）Ｘ＋ＸＣＳ２＋ＸＮaOH=（C6H9O5CS2Na）X＋XH2O　　（四）用Essigsaueanbydrid（CH3CO）２Ｏ與少量硫酸混和，浸纎維在内十數小時，取出，再溶於三氯甲烷Chloroform内，再如第一法壓於水内，即成，此爲最近發明之新法，製成品爲人造絲中最好者，</p>

<h3 id="e1">On Restoring Diplomatic Relations with the Soviet Union and Preventing Communist Influences <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Since our country officially revoked the Soviet Union's consular privileges in December of the 16th year of the Republic [1927], recognized the suppression of the Soviet Union's state-owned commercial organizations in China, and ceased their business operations in China, followed by the formal declaration of severing diplomatic relations in the 18th year of the Republic [1929] due to the deterioration of negotiations over the Chinese Eastern Railway, the Chinese people have generally regarded the Soviet Union as a fearsome flood or beast, unapproachable. Consequently, any discussion of the Soviet Union has been avoided and deemed undesirable. In the past three or four years, aside from Mr. Mo Dehui's stay in Moscow to conduct negotiations regarding the Chinese Eastern Railway, there has been virtually no other relationship between China and the Soviet Union. However, with the sudden outbreak of the September 18th Incident last year, the diplomatic situation took a turn for the worse. Gradually, proposals emerged for restoring diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union to break the current diplomatic deadlock. During the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, a formal proposal was made. Former Foreign Minister Chen Youren particularly advocated for it. Last month, Central Executive Committee member Sun Ke issued a statement saying that the basic principle should be to unite with nations around the world that treat us with equality and abolish unequal treaties to achieve the independence of the Chinese nation. He also stated that our country's diplomacy is currently isolated and helpless, and has reached its extreme. To achieve the goal of thoroughly resisting Japan, it is necessary to first find friendly nations. At present, there are two nations that can join hands with our country: the United States and the Soviet Union. He firmly maintained his position on restoring diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. Even the current Foreign Minister Luo Wengan, in a statement issued on the 2nd of this month, acknowledged that the voices for restoring diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union have been growing louder in recent times. He also stated that the government is still carefully considering this issue. Finally, he added that if some people believe that the hidden danger of communism will spread further after the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and the the Soviet Union, it is his opinion that restoring diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union does not mean accepting or agreeing with communism. Considering the above various news reports and verifying them with the government's formal approval last month for the Soviet Union's TASS news agency to establish a presence in China, the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union is likely in active preparation. We also believe that restoring diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union is now truly a matter of urgency. We sincerely hope that the government will make a decisive decision without further hesitation. The reason why our country severed diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and why the general public opposes or is skeptical about restoring diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union is solely due to the Soviet Union's assistance to the Chinese Communist Party and its incitement of the Chinese communist revolution, is it not? We believe that such concerns, from their superficial appearance, do seem reasonable. However, with a little more thought, one cannot help but consider them an overestimation, or perhaps even a shortsighted view. Why do we say this? The Soviet Union is the only socialist country today. Its new political system and institutions, as well as its persuasive propaganda, are, at a time when capitalism has reached its peak and class divisions are very clear, quite capable of stirring up the emotions of the general lower classes. If China and the Soviet Union were to restore diplomatic relations, it would provide the Communist Party with a convenient platform for propaganda. This is something that we must pay attention to. However, we believe that restoring diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union is one thing, and preventing communist propaganda is another. As Luo Wengan said, restoring diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union does not mean accepting or agreeing with communism. Diplomatic relations can be restored, while communist propaganda can also be stopped through legitimate means of negotiation. These two things cannot be conflated. This is extremely clear and obvious. For example, Germany and Turkey both have close diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, yet neither Germany nor Turkey has become communist. Instead, they have broken their diplomatic deadlock by allying with the Soviet Union. From this, it can be seen that as long as it is handled properly, restoring diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union does not necessarily lead to the danger of being incited by it. Furthermore, the emergence of communism is by no means due to the existence of the Soviet Union. If communism could be stopped by severing diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, then how did the Soviet Union itself come into being? How was Tsarist Russia overthrown? The real problem in our country today does not lie in the incitement of communism, but in the causes of communism's emergence. The Dagong Evening News on April 18th, in its article (The Real Problem), stated: "Communism, like other organisms, can only flourish in soil that is particularly suitable for its growth. It is nurtured in soil of unfair oppression and dissatisfaction. Agitators and fanatics can certainly assist in the growth of communism, but they cannot cause communism to arise in happy and prosperous regions. Their propaganda cannot penetrate the ears of the people." This view is most insightful. Today, without considering the state of politics in our country or the livelihood of the people, whether there is enough soil to nurture communism, or whether there are opportunities to be incited by communism, and simply relying on severing diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, or even avoiding all discussion of the Soviet Union, thinking that this is enough to prevent communism, is truly abandoning the fundamental and pursuing the superficial. Our country has severed diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union for four years now. However, the Communist Party within the country has not disappeared as a result. Why is that? If the politics within our country were clear and the livelihood of the people were stable, then worms would not breed in unrotted water. Why should we worry about the incitement of communism? Therefore, we believe that those who oppose the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union on the grounds of concerns that the Soviet Union will incite the Chinese revolution are either overestimating or shortsighted. We strongly advocate for the immediate restoration of diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union. The reasons for this will be discussed further.</p>

<p>Preliminary takeover has been completed. Preparing to continue work. The first step of takeover, as stipulated for Jiading, Liuhe, Luodian, Nanxiang, and other places, was completed by dispatching personnel on the previous two days. The second step of takeover, as stipulated for Zhenru, Zhabei, Dachang, Yanghang, and other places, was decided by the Takeover Committee yesterday to hold its second meeting at noon today to discuss the implementation plan further. Regarding the withdrawal of Japanese troops from the aforementioned areas, the Joint Committee indicated that the withdrawal would begin gradually from today onward. The situation of the takeover in Nanxiang and other places, after a detailed inspection by Commissioner Li Mingyang, was reported to the meeting yesterday. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e3">The First Step of Takeover Has Been Completed <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>▲ Li's Inspection Report: Li Mingyang, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial and Municipal Security Department, departed for the Jiading area around 5:00 AM the day before yesterday to inspect the takeover situation. Yesterday, Mr. Li specifically reported the details of the inspection to the Takeover Committee, stating: "At 5:20 AM on the 10th, Director Li Mingyang, accompanied by Interpreter Tao Xiaojie, traveled by car via Caojiadu to Zhenru, passing through the area once. The area was still garrisoned by Japanese troops and awaiting takeover. At 6:50 AM, we went to Jiading. At 8:00 AM, we passed by Luodian and met with Japanese Major Iwai, asking when the Japanese troops in the area would withdraw. He replied that they would withdraw at noon today (the 15th). Sun Xiwun, the magistrate of Baoshan County, who was designated to take over the town, was scheduled to lead the police from Jiading at 10:00 AM that morning to take over the garrison. At 9:40 AM, we arrived at Jiading Station and saw seven public buses that had been destroyed by the Japanese troops. Later, we met with Magistrate Pan Zhongjia and Shen Jinghua, Director of the Public Security Bureau, who stated that they had departed from Shanghai on the morning of the 8th, passed through Songjiang and Qingpu, and traveled overnight. At 8:00 AM on the morning of the 9th, they arrived at Jiwang Temple with 40 police officers led by Director Shen. They took over the garrison in Nanxiang after lunch that day. The Japanese side withdrew completely at 2:00 PM. The area was still peaceful. In Jiading, Magistrate Pan led 150 police officers and took over the garrison at 3:00 PM that afternoon. The Japanese troops had already withdrawn beforehand. The local security situation after the takeover was well-arranged. Some of the businesses had already opened, and many citizens had returned home to tidy up their residences. At 10:20 AM, we departed from Jiading. At 11:05 AM, we arrived at Liuhe. There were no Japanese troops on the way from Luodian to Liuhe. After arriving in the town, we met with Huang Songsheng, the head of the town's security corps, who stated that the Japanese troops in the area had withdrawn completely at noon on the 9th. Our police officers were welcomed into the town by two military police officers dispatched by Japanese Major Iwai at 8:00 AM that morning and assigned to take over the defense. After the takeover, the local situation was still peaceful. Some of the shops had already opened for business. Director Li and others then departed from Liuhe at 12:10 PM and returned directly to Shanghai." ▲ Investigation of the Japanese Troop Withdrawal: The first phase of the Japanese troop withdrawal was quite rapid. According to an investigation by a reporter from the Huadong News Agency, the Japanese troops who had withdrawn from the front line to Hongkou on the morning of the day before yesterday included 936 warhorses, more than 60 machine guns, 42 artillery vehicles, and approximately 5,000 Japanese troops at 9:00 AM. There were also more than 30 carts of baggage. In the afternoon of the same day, another 800 Japanese troops, 128 warhorses, machine guns, artillery vehicles, and a total of 22 carts of baggage withdrew from the front line. All of the above entered Disweilu and Oujialu via Tiantong'an Road and arrived at Tongzhou Road, reaching the Bund wharf and boarding ships to leave Shanghai. ▲ Continued Japanese Troop Withdrawal Today: The Japanese troops currently stationed in Zhabei, Zhenru, Dachang, Yanghang, and other places require various preparations beforehand, and the deadline for their complete withdrawal is not yet certain. According to Mr. Yu Hongjun, a member of our side of the Joint Committee, speaking to a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency, the Japanese troops stationed in the aforementioned areas can begin to withdraw gradually from today onward. It is also understood that the last remaining portion of the Japanese 14th Division had already boarded ships yesterday in preparation to leave Shanghai. ▲ Capital Police Arrive: The capital has specially dispatched 200 security team members to assist in the takeover of the evacuated areas. They arrived in Luodian at 7:00 PM on the 10th via Taicang and Jiading in preparation for the takeover of Baoshan, Dachang, Yanghang, and other places. Li Yishi, the head of the team, specially dispatched Mr. Wu, an officer from the police department who had traveled from the capital, to Shanghai this morning to report to Director Li before returning to Luodian. ▲ Investigation of Police Force at the Front Line: The police force on our side in Jiading and other places was thoroughly investigated yesterday, totaling 700 people, including 200 in Nanxiang, 150 in Jiading, 130 in Luodian, 50 in Liuhe, and the remaining 200 temporarily stationed in Anting in preparation for the takeover of Baoshan, Zhenru, and other places. Furthermore, it has been decided that the Beiping police will arrive at the front line on the 14th. ▲ Beiping Police Depart South Today: Tianjin, 11th Telegram: 550 Beiping and Tianjin police officers, led by Lu Lu, departed south for Shanghai at 2:00 PM on the 11th to take over the defense.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Second Takeover Meeting to Be Held This Afternoon <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>▲ Discussing the Second Step's Plan: The Takeover Committee, with the Japanese troops in Nanxiang, Jiading, Liuhe, and Luodian having withdrawn in three phases, has completed the first step of its work. Therefore, it is scheduled to hold its second meeting at the United News Agency at 12:00 PM today to discuss the second step of the takeover plan. ▲ Liaising on the Japanese Troop Withdrawal: Committee member Yu Hongjun of the Joint Committee, because the fourth-phase Japanese troop withdrawal notification had not yet arrived, liaised with the Japanese side on the fourth-phase withdrawal from the Shizilin, Yanghang, Dachang, and Zhenru line in the past two days, urging the withdrawal within the next few days. They also discussed with the Japanese side the issue of taking over Zhabei and other areas first. It is reported that the Japanese side has already agreed to this. As for the negotiation of the handover of the two railway factory issues, the Japanese side has also agreed to return them immediately. ▲ Negotiating the Takeover of Zhabei: The municipal government authorities, because the Japanese troop withdrawal has been proceeding as agreed, but have not yet received notification of when the withdrawal from Zhabei and other areas will begin, believe that the Zhabei Wusong Jiangwan area is the most prosperous area in Shanghai, and should be taken over as soon as possible to facilitate efforts to reorganize it. Therefore, they specially requested the Takeover Committee yesterday to forward the request to the Joint Committee to urge the Japanese troops in the Beiwusong Jiangwan area to withdraw as soon as possible to facilitate an early takeover. According to a spokesperson for the municipal government, the takeover of Zhabei does not conflict with the entire Japanese troop withdrawal process, because the Japanese troops stationed on the Shizilin Dachang line are Japanese naval infantry, while the areas of Zhabei and Wusong are currently under the army. The boundaries regarding withdrawal matters are very strict, so the municipal government requested the Joint Committee to negotiate with the Japanese side to withdraw the army from Zhabei and other areas within the next few days to facilitate an early takeover. ▲ Preparing for the Takeover of Zhabei: According to Mr. Yu Hongjun, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, speaking to a reporter from the Huadong News Agency, the municipal government has completely prepared for the takeover of Zhabei and only needs to receive notification of the Japanese troop withdrawal to proceed with the takeover. Zhabei's police force originally had the Fourth, Fifth, and Seventh districts, as well as the Sixth Company of the Police Brigade, with a total police force of over a thousand. The municipal government now plans to expand it slightly during the takeover. In addition to the original police force, three more companies of the Police Brigade will be added. In addition, it is planned to expand the bureau's original motorized patrol team to patrol Zhabei. Because transportation in Zhabei is quite inconvenient, the motorized patrol team can patrol the entire area of Zhabei and is also very helpful in liaison. As for the aftermath of the war in Zhabei, the municipal government is also carefully planning it. The selection of personnel for the Aftermath Committee should be finalized tonight, and the regulations of the Aftermath Committee have also been drafted and will be announced after improvements.</p>
<h3 id="e5">The Municipal Public Security Bureau Plans Police Administration <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>At 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, the Municipal Public Security Bureau held a preparatory meeting for the takeover of Zhabei's police administration.

(B) Order each district office in the war zone to instruct the police to pay attention at all times. If they smell a corpse, they must track down the location of the corpse to facilitate early removal. (C) If floating corpses or corpses buried too shallow are discovered, each district office should immediately order the families of the corpses to remove them or rebury them deeply. If there are no families, the bureau should immediately request charitable organizations to rebury them deeply. (2) Clear garbage. (3) Repair water pipes. (4) Cleaning methods. Regarding commercial matters: (1) Those who relocate their businesses must follow the new establishment procedures, re-fill out application forms, and submit them to the bureau for inspection and approval before being issued new licenses.

(3) If the premises have been destroyed or the business is unable to resume operations, the site owner or manager should report the suspension of operations in accordance with the regulations and surrender the business license to comply with the regulations. (4) If the premises are still resuming operations at the original location, but the shareholders and managers have been changed, they should re-fill out the application form in accordance with the regulations, along with the old permit, and apply for a new permit.

The above regarding special business premises includes teahouses, taverns, theaters, inns, ballrooms, and all other public places. Regarding relief matters: (1) Request the Social Affairs Bureau to promptly order landlords to repair their houses so that the disaster victims can return and live in peace. (2) Sitting idle and eating is not a long-term solution for disaster victims. Small-scale business operations cannot be undertaken without borrowing capital. The Social Affairs Bureau has a poverty loan office, and it is now planned to request the bureau to establish a light-interest poverty loan office in Zhabei as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e6">The Municipal Health Bureau Organizes Sanitation <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Since the withdrawal of Japanese troops, the sanitation in Zhabei, Yinxiang, Jiangwan, Wusong, Zhenru, and other places urgently needs to be organized. The Municipal Health Bureau has now formulated methods, and excerpts are listed below: ▲ Sanitation Work: The bureau has decided that the first step is to restore the original sanitation methods and limit the time to two weeks to clear all the accumulated garbage from various places in the past few months, bury corpses, and implement disinfection. The original sanitation equipment has been mostly lost, so it is being replenished these days, and it has been decided that 300 sanitation workers will depart from two locations: (1) Clearing the road north from Xinzha Bridge to the Zhenru Pengpu area. (2) Clearing the road north from Yuezhou Road to the Jiangwan Yinxiang area. The Wusong area will be handled separately. The funds for this have been allocated by the municipal government. ▲ Epidemic Prevention Work: After a major war, there must be a major epidemic. Epidemics have already been discovered in the Zhabei area. Therefore, the second step is to dispatch two doctors and four nurses to provide free vaccinations for citizens in each district and enforce them. They will also guide the implementation of common sense about epidemic prevention. The setting time is four months as the standard. The required funds have been submitted by the bureau to the municipal government for approval. ▲ Mobile Medical Treatment: At the same time, it has been decided to hold free medical treatment, using trucks to transport three mobile medical vehicles to implement free medical treatment in each district. Because the economy of citizens in each district has been greatly and directly hit after the war, they may lack the resources for medical treatment, or they may be reluctant to spend money on medical treatment and neglect to seek treatment when they are sick, resulting in serious illness. The required expenses have also been submitted to the municipal government for approval. Therefore, the work of the bureau has been particularly busy recently.</p>
<h3 id="e7">The Shanghai Telephone Bureau Plans to Restore Telephone Services <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangwan, Zhabei, Nanxiang, and Wusong branch bureaus of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications completely ceased operations after the outbreak of the war, and long-distance telephone calls between Nanjing and Shanghai could not be made at that time. Now that the Japanese troops have withdrawn, Bureau Director Wei Zengfu and Chief Engineer Huang Junke have begun planning to restore services. The details are listed below: ▲ A Glimpse of the Losses: The bureau has already dispatched Chief Engineer Huang to various branch bureaus to investigate the losses. It is estimated that in the Zhabei area, the poles, lines, and cables east of Song Park Road have been completely destroyed by artillery fire. Although the addresses of the First and Second Branch Bureaus have not been destroyed, the parts have all been lost. The trunk lines of the Third Branch Bureau, the trunk lines between Zhabei and the Concession, the trunk lines between long-distance telephones and the Concession and Nanshi, and the trunk lines between Zhabei and Nanshi must also be completely reinstalled. More than one hundred customers have been destroyed, and the other losses are due to theft besides war damage. The automatic telephone exchange in the Zhabei New Bureau has also been slightly damaged. The Wusong Jiangwan bureau addresses and equipment have all been destroyed. As for the Nanxiang Branch Bureau, personnel will be sent to investigate today. The largest loss is the large batch of automatic telephone materials worth more than 200,000 yuan in the Yongxing Road material warehouse, which were also completely destroyed. ▲ Repair Plan: The bureau has decided that after the Municipal Public Security Bureau takes over Zhabei, the first step is to repair and restore the telephones of each district office of the Public Security Bureau to maintain security. Because the repair project is vast, the second step is to publish a notice to register users to classify the urgency to provide the standards after repair. The third step is to repair the trunk lines of each bureau and the dedicated lines of each factory. It has also been decided to connect each line to the new bureau during the repair to avoid extra procedures when converting to automatic telephones. ▲ Requesting Materials from the Ministry: The bureau believes that telephone services urgently need to be restored, but materials are lacking, and many employees have been laid off since the war. Therefore, it has requested the Ministry of Communications to allocate materials and increase employees to actively carry out repair work. ▲ Long-Distance Telephones: Long-distance telephones between Nanjing and Shanghai have already been moved from the Zhabei Bureau to the Nanshi General Bureau. However, the cables have been damaged due to the war. The bureau has sent personnel to the Kunshan area to repair them. It is hoped that they can be repaired and connected this week.</p>
<h3 id="e8">The Nanjing-Shanghai Railway Workers Are Repairing <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>▲ Railway Personnel Arrive in Shanghai Yesterday: The Ministry of Railways specially dispatched Assistant Yang Xianfen of the Business Department and Technician Chen Guan to Shanghai by boat yesterday morning to assist in the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway reopening. At 10:00 AM yesterday, they visited Director Chen Xinghan and Traffic Director Zheng Baozhao at 6 Sichuan Road and 10 Guangdong Road, respectively, to discuss the reopening issue. It is reported that the two will not leave Shanghai and must wait until the railway is reopened before returning to Nanjing. ▲ Engineering Office Inspects the Factory: The Zhang Huabang Railway Factory Wharf was originally scheduled to be returned yesterday, but the Japanese authorities suddenly notified the Joint Committee yesterday that the Japanese soldiers in the factory still need to wait one or two days before they can be completely evacuated. At noon yesterday, Desford, a Westerner from the engineering office of both railways, drove to the factory to inspect it for a week to plan repairs. ▲ Engineer Inspects the Line: Yin Zhilu, the chief engineer of the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway, took a handcar to inspect the repair status of the railway work along the line from Suzhou to the east. He arrived in Shanghai last night and visited the traffic authorities to report. According to him, repairs are being rushed along the road from Suzhou to Zhenru and can be completed before the 14th. The Qingyang Port Bridge has been completed, and it only needs to be moved to the shore before it can be opened to traffic. ▲ Qingyang Port Bridge Has Been Built: The Nanjing-Shanghai Railway Bureau previously stated that the Qingyang Port Bridge on the railway was destroyed by Japanese troops. Now that the railway is about to open, it urgently needs to be repaired to facilitate traffic. Therefore, it dispatched Yin Zhilu, the engineer stationed in the Zhenjiang section, and Shen Shao, the engineer in the Suzhou section, among others, leading more than 70 craftsmen, to depart east from Zhenjiang on a special rescue train on the 8th. The next morning, it arrived in Kunshan and immediately moved forward to start repairs. However, the obstacles around the bridge have not yet been removed, so it is inconvenient to move forward to avoid danger. The 19th Route Army stationed there is no longer needed, so they immediately dispatched engineers to remove them. The railway bureau's craftsmen then continued to move forward at noon on the 10th and began repairs in the afternoon of the same day. Suzhou, 11th Special Dispatch: The Qingyang Port Bridge is scheduled to be completed on the 12th and will be test-driven with vehicles immediately. The damaged areas of the Lujiabang Bridge will also be repaired. The 19th Army Headquarters will move to Suzhou on the 12th due to rain. ▲ Ticket Office Temporarily Set Up on the Train: The Huangdu Station was completely burned down by people some time ago, and it is difficult to rebuild it in a short time. Director Zheng of the Traffic Office has now decided to allocate a passenger car when the railway is reopened and park it on the track at the station as a temporary ticket office. Japanese troops in Shanghai.</p>

<h3 id="e10">Evacuate Completely Within One Month <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>▲ The Armistice Agreement Does Not Contain the Phrase "Twenty-Kilometer Zone" ▲ Guo Taiqi's Important Statement to the Spokesperson of the Japanese Government ▲ The National News Agency states: Regarding the Reuters Tokyo dispatch stating that Japanese soldiers will completely withdraw from Shanghai within one month, and the official spokesperson of the Japanese government proposed not allowing Chinese troops (to enter within the twenty-kilometer zone), a reporter from the National News Agency specifically went to the hospital tonight to visit Vice Minister Guo Taiqi, the chief representative of the Sino-Japanese armistice conference, to inquire about this matter. According to him, all the envoys of friendly nations were present during the Sino-Japanese representative negotiations. From beginning to end, there was no mention of a "twenty-kilometer zone," nor was it ever discussed. If such a proposal had been made, I would have immediately rejected it. Guo also pointed out that our country's statement in Article 2 of the agreement states: "(Both sides understand that this agreement does not contain any restrictions on the movement of Chinese troops within their own territory. At that time, both sides agreed that this statement had been accepted during the meeting and there should be no objection.)" From this, it can be seen that the "twenty-kilometer zone" is completely unfounded. ▲ Reuters Tokyo dispatch, 11th: Today's news is that the Japanese government has decided to withdraw all Japanese troops in Shanghai within one month. ▲ Reuters Tokyo dispatch, 11th: An official from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated today that the cabinet decided yesterday at a meeting to withdraw all Japanese troops stationed in Shanghai within one month. The 9th Division will be withdrawn to Kanazawa. The Japanese government wants to comply with world opinion and prove that Japan's dispatch of troops to Shanghai does not have the ambition for land or other purposes, hence this decision. Although it was previously planned to maintain a semi-permanent garrison of at least one division, this latest decision will promote the restoration of the situation before the January 28th Incident, as far as the Japanese forces in Shanghai are concerned. From now on, only a small portion of the marines will remain stationed in Shanghai to protect Japanese residents in Shanghai. All other troops will return to Japan. The official continued that Japan hopes that the Chinese side will strictly abide by the provisions of the agreement and not allow Chinese troops to invade the area outside the concession within twenty kilometers. If Shanghai is threatened again after the withdrawal of Japanese troops, Japan will hold the great powers and world opinion responsible. The Japanese feel that the Japanese are fighting in Shanghai not only for their own country, but also for other countries, doing the work for others, and only getting the misunderstanding of the whole world. ▲ Reuters Nanjing dispatch, 11th: Here, it is very satisfactory to hear that the Japanese government has decided to withdraw its troops stationed in Shanghai within one month to fulfill the conditions of the armistice agreement. The political circles are closely watching the overall situation in the Northeast Provinces and North China. Copy of the armistice agreement.</p>
<h3 id="e11">Discussion and Decision on the Meaning of Words <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>▲ (Combat Actions) changed to (Hostile Actions) ▲ The copy of the Sino-Japanese armistice agreement can be signed in about two or three days. The copy of the Sino-Japanese armistice agreement was not signed yesterday, and it is still difficult to determine whether it can be signed today. According to those involved in the discussion, there is no need for both parties to meet and discuss, because the remaining small problem has been roughly drafted. Yesterday, Yin Rugeng briefly talked with Japanese Secretary Okazaki on the phone and notified the Japanese side that the problem is now being discussed by Zhang Sixu, Director of the Intelligence Department of our side, and Guo Taiqi, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs. It is expected that the signing period will not be too long, probably within two or three days. As for the meaning of the solved (Hostilities), it has been definitely changed to (hostile actions). The four words (combat actions) in the full text of the agreement previously published in newspapers will be changed to (hostile actions) when the Chinese copy is signed in the future. In addition, there are five points that our side requested the Japanese side to modify in the Japanese copy of the agreement: (1) The word (nearby) listed in Article 3 of the agreement should be changed to (measures). Listed in Article 3, the word (nearby) should be changed to (adjacent). The four characters (when dividing into four rooms) (Japanese) should be changed to (temporarily). Listed as Attachment No. 3 under Article 4, the three characters (attendees) should be changed to (participants), and the two characters (guard) should be changed to (monitor). Regarding the above points, the Japanese side has indicated that there is generally no problem. Only one or two words have not been completely decided, but it can be generally resolved.</p>

<p>▲ The 13th Fleet of warships, four destroyers including the Japanese Navy's 13th Fleet Wakake, came to Shanghai from Sasebo and took on the task of transporting the army, so they often berthed at the Yako Sha area outside the Wusong Estuary. Yesterday, they received Commander Nomura's order and weighed anchor at 9:00 a.m. in the river in front of the Huishan Wharf to return to Japan. At the time of departure, Nomura also issued instructions. ▲ Garrison Defense Change of Japanese naval landing forces stationed in Shanghai. Recently, there has been a garrison defense change. 300 marines were dispatched from the naval corps of the Wu Garrison Office and arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, and 200 marines in Shanghai whose garrison period had expired were withdrawn to Yokosuka. It has been decided that at 10:00 a.m. today, they will board the Nojima special service ship at Huangpu Wharf and leave Shanghai. ▲ Supplementing Military Supplies The 14th Division of the Japanese Army in Shanghai is now ordered by the Japanese government to go to the Northeast Provinces, intending to increase the strength of the brigade to deal with the various volunteer national salvation self-defense armies outside Guanwai. The Japanese Army Ministry specially dispatched two transport ships on the 10th and 11th, fully loaded with military equipment, ammunition and other items to supplement the division. Those who came to Shanghai to supplement the division were already unloading yesterday. According to a certain officer in the division, the army will be responsible for the first line of defense when it goes to the Northeast this time. The Wuzhen Road Incident</p>
<h3 id="e13">The Municipal Council Reports to the Consular Body Based on Facts <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>▲ Sufficient Proof of the Falsity of the Japanese Consular Report ▲ However, the Japanese Representative Covered It Up for It, According to the Mainland Daily: Regarding the incident on the 3rd of this month in which Japanese soldiers crossed the Wuzhen Road Bridge and stabbed Chinese people, the report of the Public Concession Municipal Council to the Consular Body yesterday (the 10th) is in direct contradiction with the official statement of the Japanese Consulate General on May 4. The Japanese side claimed that the Japanese soldiers did not carry any weapons across the bridge at that time, while the Municipal Council's report stated that after investigation, it was found that the Japanese soldiers were all armed and intimidated Chinese residents near the Wuzhen Road Bridge, committing violent acts. At least ten people were injured to varying degrees by bayonets and gun butts and had to be hospitalized for treatment. It also stated that when the Japanese authorities were in Shanghai, they often showed their force, but it was of no benefit. The effect of their intimidation was far less than their provocation of Chinese emotions. Finally, they asked the consular body to take appropriate action on this matter and be responsible for preventing the same incident from happening again in the future. Now, looking at the Municipal Council's report, it can be seen that the official report published by the Japanese Consulate General on the 4th of this month has many cover-ups. The Japanese side said that Chinese hooligans threw stones across the river and injured Japanese soldiers, while the Municipal Council's report considered the reasons claimed by the Japanese authorities for the Japanese soldiers' intrusion into the concession to be insufficient. It believed that even if one or two lower-class Chinese threw a few stones, it was not a good reason for the Japanese soldiers to intrude into the concession. Moreover, the Japanese soldiers had stabbed and beaten innocent Chinese, invaded Chinese shops, and attempted to seize police power and arrest many Chinese. Only when the concession patrol intervened with the support of American soldiers did they agree to release them. Later, the reporter from the Mainland Daily visited the American Consul General and Leader Consul Cunningham yesterday. According to him, he had received the Municipal Council's report, but he was not yet ready to make any statement at this time. This matter must be considered or acted upon by the consular body. The consular body meeting next Tuesday may discuss this matter. Reuters Geneva dispatch on the 10th: The Japanese representative sent a letter to the Secretariat, saying that the main force of the Japanese army in Shanghai had begun to withdraw on May 6 from the positions west of the Zizilin to Yangxing Dacha Zhenru front. However, in order to facilitate the work of the Mixed Committee and the takeover of the Chinese police, the Japanese police team will be temporarily retained in Shanchuan Jiading Nanxiang and Luodian to maintain local public order. The retention period of this police team is three days, and the withdrawal of troops is continuing. The Japanese representative also sent a letter to the Secretariat, saying that regarding the report of the Chinese representative on May 6 that Japanese soldiers on the Wuzhen Road Bridge in Shanghai crossed the border and stabbed Chinese people, it stated that Chinese rioters, using the trench line built by Japanese soldiers on the Wuzhen Road Bridge crossing the border to stab Chinese people as cover, threw stones and attacked the Japanese sentries on the north bank of the river. On May 3, about 300 Chinese made provocative actions again and threw stones at Japanese sailors. The Japanese soldiers could no longer bear it, so they sent 30 soldiers to drive them away, but they did not bring in rifles. The two sides punched each other, but no Chinese were seriously injured. The allegation in the Chinese representative's document that they attacked innocent civilians is not true. Northeast</p>

<p>Political tutelage is the process of reaching constitutional government, which is different from the one-party dictatorship of Russia and Italy. As long as the conditions for constitutional government are met and completed, it can be realized. Therefore, the current People's Government Party must cooperate to complete the conditions. The Central Government is now planning to establish a central public opinion organ based on the requirements of the general public. All specific methods are being discussed and will be implemented soon. We are also working hard to prepare for the establishment of local public opinion organs, and various counties and cities are also preparing to establish senates.</p>

<p>After the Shanghai and Shenyang incidents occurred, China suffered great imperialist aggression and oppression. The Kuomintang and the government have always taken the abolition of unequal treaties and the resistance to foreign aggression as their responsibilities. Regarding this incident, we should be unyielding and unswerving, and we will never sign any treaties that lose power and humiliate the country. The Shanghai armistice agreement is just a plan for the withdrawal of troops, which does not contain political conditions, nor does it have other secret conditions. We hope that the people will not be misled by provocative words.

<p>Generally, people think that after the foreign affairs problem is resolved, internal problems may occur. The news is mostly untrue, which is enough to affect the overall situation. It is hoped that the press will be particularly cautious. During the Shanghai war, a certain newspaper published a survey of the deployment of our army, which was very detrimental to our army. Newspapers are related to the survival of the country, the interests of the nation, and the prosperity and decline of society. The news should adopt materials from the active and constructive aspects, and correct and criticize social pathologies at any time, instead of just catering to social psychology. In the future, a specific plan should be studied for the national news policy. (Central News Agency telegram on the 11th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Luo Wengan talked about (1) The Shanghai organizations mistakenly thought that the armistice agreement contained secret nature, and repeatedly stated that it was still unable to understand. However, the agreement was co-signed by the envoys of friendly countries, and the envoys will never abandon their bright attitude, which will cause them to lose the sympathy of our country's nation. It is planned to take photos of the original text of the agreement and publish it in the newspaper to dispel public doubts. (2) The report said that Guo Taiqi resigned as the British ambassador, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet received a telegram from him. At this time of national crisis, there is a lack of diplomatic talents. Even if he really sent a telegram of resignation, the Central Government will definitely try to persuade him to stay. (3) Regarding the issue of Sino-Russian resumption of diplomatic relations, the Central Government is soliciting opinions from all parties and plans to submit them to the Central Political Committee for consideration.

<p>Herriot to Organize New Cabinet; Theidier Agreed to Serve Temporarily ▲ Guomin News Agency, Versailles, 11th. After Lebrun was elected the new French President today, Theidier immediately submitted the cabinet's general resignation, but agreed to continue serving as before until the new Chamber of Deputies opens its inaugural meeting on June 1st and Herriot organizes a new cabinet, then hand over. ▲ Havas, Paris, 10th. Theidier stated in his letter of resignation that (the cabinet hereby resigns to the President, according to customary practice, the new President assumes office at the beginning, and the cabinet resigns, the new President must reappoint the resigning members. This time, I hope the President will not adhere to the precedents, because the current responsibilities are heavy and difficult to deal with. Various important negotiations are underway, and important decisions that affect the future must be taken almost every day. In order to assume this kind of responsibility, it must be possible to act freely. However, the results of the recent elections have changed the majority party in the Chamber of Deputies. Therefore, the current cabinet has lost its freedom of action and must ask the President to break the precedent. As for routine affairs, the cabinet members still obey the order and are willing to temporarily take charge, but for the sake of the overall situation, I hope to unload this burden soon.) ▲ Reuters, Paris, 10th. After Lebrun was elected President of France, the current Prime Minister Theidier immediately resigned to the new President in accordance with French political precedent. The government party led by Theidier failed in this election, so his resignation should be approved. The first task of the new President is to instruct the leaders of other parties to organize a cabinet. Although Lebrun's election was expected, people from all walks of life still gathered in Versailles on the day of the election to be the first to receive the announcement. However, because the former President was assassinated, the whole country mourned, resulting in a less enthusiastic atmosphere than in previous presidential elections. The joint vote of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies had black紗覆蓋 on the ballot box. Lebrun, in his capacity as Speaker of the Senate, announced the opening of the meeting, saying, (The President has passed away suddenly.) As soon as these words were uttered, all the councilors stood up in respect. Lebrun, representing the Congress, paid tribute to Doumer's portrait, and then read a speech, the main idea of which was to express sympathy to Doumer's family. As a result of the election, Lebrun won 633 votes out of 826 votes, and was elected with a large majority. After the election, the inauguration ceremony was held. Prime Minister Theidier supervised the inauguration and personally handed over the election announcement documents and the national seal to the new President. The exact number of votes in this election is as follows: Lebrun 633 votes, Paul Faure 114 votes, Painleve 12 votes, Cachin 8 votes, other candidates received a total of 10 votes, blank and invalid votes 49 votes. ▲ Guomin News Agency, Versailles, 11th. It is reported that before being elected the new French President this morning, Lebrun had received three threatening letters. One letter was signed by a Russian terrorist, and the content of all three letters was to threaten him that if he was elected, he would suffer the same fate as Doumer. Therefore, the police were heavily guarded today, but it is expected that these letters were written by madmen.</p>

<p>Goring, the leader of the National Socialist Party, strongly defended the no-confidence motion proposed by the party, while Groner, the Minister of Defense and Interior Minister, tried his best to defend the legitimacy of the government's disbanding of the National Socialist Party Stormtroopers. The two sides could not avoid verbal conflict, which quickly caused an uproar in the whole hall, causing the meeting to rest for ten minutes before it could continue. However, at the beginning of the meeting, the venue was still relatively quiet. First, the second reading of the government's proposed fund bill was passed by 245 votes to 224 votes. All members of the National Socialist Party, the Communist Party, the National Rights Party, and several other small parties voted against the government. After the bill was voted on, Strasser, a key figure in the National Socialist Party, stepped onto the podium to explain the party's economic plan, and the audience listened attentively. After that, Goring, the leader of the party, stepped onto the podium to question the government's suppression of the National Socialist Party Stormtroopers, his tone was extremely fierce, demanding the revocation of the emergency order to disband the team, claiming that this ban was due to foreign pressure. At this time, Prime Minister Brüning stood up to deny, stressing that the ban was issued purely for internal political reasons, and that the government would never succumb to foreign pressure. At this time, members of the National Socialist Party issued jeers, and the noise started, becoming more and more intense. Vice-President Eisele repeatedly asked members to maintain order, and the meeting was able to continue. Lithuanian Pan-Nationalist Party</p>

<p>From Xi'an to the Shen Bao: We, the residents of Shaanxi, have suffered from years of continuous disasters, with deaths reported everywhere. Thanks to your repeated assistance, we have managed to survive. However, rural areas are bankrupt, and there are still many unemployed. Even without various disasters this year, the survivors in the disaster areas would still find it difficult to make a living. Unexpectedly, spring brought successive severe frosts, wind, and hailstorms, coupled with months of severe drought without rain, causing crops to wither and creating a tragic situation all around. Moreover, in various districts north of the Wei River and in counties along the western route, many fields have not been sown, making harvest hopeless. People are demolishing houses and fleeing, reporting disasters and requesting relief in nearly seventy counties. Relief efforts are inadequate, leaving us deeply ashamed and heartbroken. We would rather face death than bear this. We earnestly beseech you to show great compassion, quickly extend a helping hand to thoroughly save the remaining people, and widely bestow your magnanimous grace. It is the way of a gentleman to help those in urgent need, and the way of a bodhisattva to give charity. The telegram is urgent, and we cannot help but weep in prayer. Kang Yuyao, Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Relief Association, bows in reverence.</p>
<p>From Fuzhou to the Shen Bao, forwarded to all newspapers and compatriots nationwide: The Sino-Japanese Shanghai Ceasefire Agreement was formally signed on the 5th, the harm of which to the nation is unparalleled. According to the terms of the agreement, our troops lose the ability to mobilize within our own territory, while Japanese troops can be stationed in our interior. As for security, it is entirely maintained by police commanded by a joint committee. Moreover, there is no clear stipulation regarding the so-called temporary restrictions. How can we be sure that our government authorities, who do not consider the people as important, will not cause confusion or reversal in the details, or that there are no other secret clauses besides the five items? The secret treaty of 1905 gave the Japanese a pretext, and the Shanghai Agreement of 1932 is even more unfathomable. The 19th Route Army is exhausted and without reinforcements. The entire populace feels immense pain. Yet the government willingly bends the knee and speaks humbly. The imperialists' division and slaughter are gradually being revealed. The state exists to protect the people, and the people love the country. Survival and demise are interdependent and closely linked. What our hearts perceive as dangerous, how can we remain silent? We vow to deny these conditions that are detrimental to the people and will not stop until the goal of their cancellation is achieved. We hope our compatriots will rise up and pursue this urgently. The interests of the people must not be exploited. This is our heartfelt plea, submitted for your public review. The Joint Conference of Student Representatives from Secondary and Higher Education Institutions in Fuzhou bows in reverence.</p>

<h3 id="e96">The Fourth Meeting of the National Government <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Luoyang dispatch: The National Government Committee held its fourth meeting at the National Government on the 10th. Attendees included Wang Zhengting, Liu Shouchong, Enkebatu, and Chairman Lin Sen. The following matters were discussed: 1. Resolved to announce the Enforcement Law of the Civil Procedure Law. 2. Resolved to announce the Organizational Regulations of the National Bureau of Weights and Measures of the Ministry of Industry. 3. Resolved to announce the Organizational Regulations of the Central Antiquities Preservation Committee. 4. The Central Executive Committee sent a letter stating that at the Second Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Executive Committee, members Wang Zhaoming and Ju Zheng proposed pensions for deceased and disabled soldiers over the years, and member Feng Yuxiang proposed honoring martyrs and providing pensions for the disabled. The Second Plenary Session resolved to hand these cases over to the National Government to establish a Pensions Committee for handling. It was resolved to forward the case to the Executive Yuan for instructions to the Ministry of Military Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Interior for joint consultation and handling. 5. Member Kong Xiangxi telegraphed to request a clarification of six points regarding internal affairs: (1) The regulations for punishing bandits and kidnappers should not be abolished. (2) The positions of administrative officials should be better protected. (3) Judges should not be replaced lightly. (4) County magistrates should be selected based on their talents and given real power, and their authority should not be distributed to various bureaus. (5) In the execution of provincial administration, responsibility lies with the various departments. The secretariat of the provincial government should not establish sections similar in function to the various departments, to avoid delays in submission and division of authority. (6) A salary sufficient to maintain integrity is a permanent principle of the state. In recent years, salaries have been reduced due to internal and external troubles, which was a temporary measure that could not be helped. However, if officials are not adequately supported, it will be difficult for them to serve the public with an empty stomach. It seems that this should not be taken as a regular practice. It was resolved to forward the case to the Executive Yuan. (6) The Executive Yuan presented a report from the Ministry of Industry requesting that the deadlines for stock transfer procedures in the Enforcement Law of the Company Law be extended by one year each. The Executive Yuan passed the proposal and requested approval for record, in addition to instructions. It was resolved to approve the record. (7) The Executive Yuan presented a report stating that at the 22nd meeting of the Executive Yuan, Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua proposed that the Compilation and Examination Department of the ministry be abolished and a National Compilation and Translation Bureau be established. The organizational regulations and regular and temporary budget estimates were drafted and submitted for public decision. It was resolved to approve the proposal. In addition to ordering the ministry to announce and implement these regulations through a ministry order and to send the regular and temporary budget estimates to the Accounting Office of the National Government for review and transfer to the Central Political Council for approval, the document was submitted for review and record. It was resolved to approve the record.</p>

<p>▲Japan has seized hegemony over the yellow race ▲Western civilization will also face a major threat The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun reported that Mussolini recently raised the specter of the Yellow Peril, saying, "Japan has now surpassed the yellow race and seized hegemony. It will pose a major threat to Western civilization. We white races should quickly rise up to protect ourselves." His argument is the same as that of Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany in the past regarding the dreaded Yellow Peril. Moreover, Mussolini's position is as important in international politics as Wilhelm's. Now Mussolini believes that Japan's rise is detrimental to future world stability and says that China is now under Japanese hegemony. Although China has gone through centuries, it still sleeps soundly and believes that China will not be able to awaken for some time. Because China cannot develop its inherent civilization to the extreme, it is expected that although China will be strong, it will ultimately not be able to surpass the Japanese yellow race. What is worrying is that today's white race is neither internally united nor externally coordinated. In the future, as Japan develops, Western civilization will be threatened." (According to Mussolini's argument, will our Chinese nation truly never awaken and willingly remain under the Japanese usurpation of power? May our people quickly awaken!)</p>

Doihara answered Lytton's questions in detail regarding his role as the mayor of Fengtian after the incident, as well as the causes and consequences of the incident. Finally, Lytton sarcastically said to Doihara, "I heard in Beiping that you are the head of the current Wokou, so before meeting you, I was sure you were a terrible and spicy person." Upon hearing this, Doihara laughed loudly. The Japanese people criticized Lytton for being indiscreet.</p>

<p>▲7,000 Sailors Nationwide are Unemployed The Kobe Shimbun reported that the future of the maritime industry is bleak and there is no hope of recovery. Currently, sailors nationwide are trapped in an unprecedented state of poverty. There are 3,830 ordinary sailors and 2,621 senior officers. If all of them were employed, with 34 ordinary sailors per 5,000-ton vessel, that would require 650,000 tons of shipping. With an average of eight senior officers per vessel, that would require 1,635,000 tons of shipping. Currently, about 560 senior officers graduate from merchant marine academies nationwide each year. Not only is there no room for senior officers, but it is also extremely difficult for sailors, firemen, oilers, etc., to find jobs. Currently, the principals of various local merchant marine academies are holding important meetings to study solutions.</p>

<h3 id="e105">Disaster Relief and Bandit Suppression Propositions <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>▲Disaster relief is more important than bandit suppression ▲But disaster relief must proceed in tandem with bandit suppression A Hankou dispatch states that He Chengjun, the Pacification Commissioner stationed in Hubei, published a statement on disaster relief and bandit suppression on the 10th, saying: "Although disaster relief and bandit suppression are two separate matters, they are actually inseparable. In the current situation, disaster relief is even more important than bandit suppression. Since the floods last year, people have been displaced. Although the central and local governments have tried to provide relief, the disaster area is too large, and there are too many victims. Relief efforts are insufficient, and funds and wheat are difficult to sustain. Moreover, since the September 18th Incident, affected by the national crisis, the various charitable relief efforts have ended long ago, American wheat has been exhausted, and there are no funds left. Previously, there was still hope for the spring harvest, but now the disaster area has not recovered, and planting has been missed. If there is no harvest this year, the restoration of the disaster area to its original state is almost impossible. Thinking of the millions of victims who have no clothes or food, it is truly pitiful. If we do not urgently seek relief, the livelihoods of the starving people will be in jeopardy, which will affect military operations for bandit suppression. For example, when Army Commander Xu Kecheng (i.e., Xu Yuanquan) was in Yingcheng directing bandit suppression, he personally witnessed the suffering of the disaster victims and privately disbursed 4,000 bags of flour. This shows the large number of disaster victims in the bandit areas. I also recall that before the flood last year, He's bandits were defeated at Wudang Mountain, and there were fewer than 10,000 remaining. Duan's bandits numbered only 3,000 to 4,000. Due to the flood, they could not be completely wiped out at that time. In less than a year, He has gathered more than 10,000 again. It is inevitable that hungry people will be forced by hunger and cold and enticed by bandits. How can hungry people willingly become bandits? If there is adequate relief, they will naturally awaken and return to good. Therefore, if bandit suppression does not urgently seek disaster relief, it may be difficult to achieve success on time. People from all walks of life are aware of this situation. In order to find ways to provide relief to the people in the bandit areas, I have consulted with Chairman Xia Lingbing (i.e., Xia Douyin) and requested that Zhu Huaibing, the director of the Civil Affairs Department, go to the counties along the Nang River to inspect, comfort the refugees, and restore their livelihoods. Yesterday, Director Zhu telegraphed to report that he had arrived in Hanchuan and said that disaster victims were everywhere, which was truly heartbreaking. Yesterday, the Flood Relief Association勉凑10,000 yuan amidst great difficulties to remit for relief. Therefore, while bandit suppression is an urgent task at present, providing relief to disaster victims is even more urgent. I have already stated this to Chairman Chiang and Premier Wang in Beijing, and they both clearly understand and are willing to find ways to provide relief. At that time, the Shanghai War broke out, and the national crisis was urgent, so the government was unable to take care of everything. Now the central finances are still extremely difficult. The Flood Relief Association recently telegraphed the central government, requesting that it borrow 20 million tons of American wheat for Hubei Province, as before, which will be repaid by Hubei Province in the future, but no reply has been received yet, and it is not known whether it can be done. In short, disaster relief is the most important plan at present. How to raise huge sums of money and provide relief as soon as possible is what I hope people from all walks of life will pay close attention to. As for the bandit suppression situation, it has been good recently. Since the battles of Wamiaoji and Longquan Town in central Hubei, the remnants of He and Duan's bandits have been severely wounded, and the bandit forces have been greatly reduced. The remnants are fleeing in all directions and are being cleared out by the troops of Xiao Zhichu and Zhang Zhenhan of the 10th Army. The remnants of Diaowen Lake will also be eliminated soon. Supervisor Xu Kecheng is planning and directing military operations for bandit suppression in that area and will go to Beijing again in a few days to meet with Chairman Chiang and report everything. As for eastern Hubei, Zhang Yinxiang, Ge Yunlong, Peng Zhenshan, and other troops are stationed for suppression. The Pinghan Railway line in northern Hubei is garrisoned by Ma Hongkui, Fan Shisheng, and other troops, as well as the 13th Division, and it is very peaceful. The remnants of Kong Hechong's bandits in Daye and Yangxin in southern Hubei, bordering Jiangxi, are being cleared out by Guo Rudong, Xie Bin, and the security regiments, and the fighting is still fierce. However, the funds for bandit suppression are difficult to obtain and urgently need to be raised. The local gentry of this province have previously established a Clean-up Promotion Association to assist the government in its work, but the gentry and wealthy donations have not yet yielded any results. Currently, the Hubei Salt Affairs Audit Office has agreed to assist with 100,000 yuan per month for a period of nine months to be allocated to the Hubei Provincial Bandit Suppression Fund. The office has telegraphed the Shanghai General Audit Office to negotiate, but it is still hoped that 150,000 yuan can be allocated per month and the period extended to one year. As for the expenses of the National Army stationed in Hubei, after my earnest request to Chairman Chiang, the monthly payment has been increased by 10%, but it is still only enough for the troops' food. After the troops are mobilized, straw sandals and porters are needed, and funds are needed everywhere. Hubei Province should bear 420,000 yuan for bandit suppression expenses, and although the provincial treasury is stretched, it will still find ways to allocate it to meet urgent needs. I have already sent a letter to Chairman Xia, instructing the Finance Department to include this in the necessary items of administrative expenses and pay it first, and then reimburse it after the Clean-up Promotion Association raises funds. In addition, after Division Commander Wang Lingji arrived in Hankou, he discussed specific measures for clearing out the bandits in western Hubei and assisting in clearing out the remnants of bandits in central Hubei, and there will be results in the near future. In short, disaster relief must proceed in tandem with bandit suppression, and bandit suppression must have sufficient funding. He is discussing this in detail with Chairman Xia and all parties these days, and we must proceed simultaneously." (May 10th)</p>
<h3 id="e106">Guangdong Army's Slow Advance to Aid Fujian <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>▲Yunxiao County on the Fujian Border Eagerly Pleads for Troops A Shantou dispatch states that the Guangdong army's entry into Fujian to suppress bandits was initially quite rapid, but after discovering that Zhang Zhen's troops often retreated without fighting, they changed to a strategy of slow advance. However, it is heard that Li Zongren and Chen Jitang have agreed to transfer an additional fourteen regiments of troops from Guangxi Province to Fujian, with all military expenses provided by Guangdong. As for the Guangdong army's Huang Renhuan's troops that have already entered Fujian, they recovered Wuping Shangkang on April 22, using the Zhong Wencai's troops, reorganized from the Western Fujian Armed Self-Help Corps, as the vanguard. The red bandits Luo Binghui's troops, defeated, hid in Wan'an Liangshan Liujia and other places near Wuping. They returned on the 25th and attacked the city of Wuping. The bandit suppression army also increased a regiment to reinforce them. On the way, they encountered Luo's bandits at Gulougang and engaged in a fierce battle for several hours. The Zhong Wencai's troops, originally stationed in Wucheng, happened to arrive again. The bandits were attacked from both sides and could not withstand it. The 8th Division's Deputy Commander Ouyang Xin's regiment came from Zhongchiwei and severely attacked the bandits. More than 100 bandits were killed, including one regimental commander and four company commanders. Many bandits were wounded. Thirty-five rifles, four Mauser pistols, and a large amount of baggage were seized. More than 100 prisoners were taken. The remnants of the bandits fled to Yongpingzhai Dongliu. After Zhanglong was captured, all sectors of Yunxiao County sent telegrams to Shantou pleading for assistance, saying, "The 49th Division withdrew from Zhangpu and Yunxiao day by day. Initially, a small number of red bandits came to various villages to propagandize, and local communists took the opportunity to burn, kill, and ravage uncontrollably. Please send troops to suppress them quickly. The division will be sent on a scheduled date, and all the people of the county are willing to be the vanguard, eagerly awaiting a reply. Yunxiao Party, Commerce, and Student Groups bow in reverence." Another telegram was sent to Chen Jitang in Guangzhou, saying, "Commander Zhang is retreating to Zhao'an, and the communists have occupied Zhangpu. The people of Yunxiao are uniting for self-defense, but their strength is weak. Please send a large army from Huanggang to Yunxiao to rescue us. We look forward to a reply. The Yunxiao Urban and Rural Joint Affairs Association bows in reverence." Another telegram was sent by refugees from Zhangzhou, Chen Jian'an and others, with roughly the same meaning. (May 5th)</p>

<p>▲The Superintendent Orders Attention to Impersonation of Public Officials The Construction Department ordered this county to pay close attention to people pretending to be public officials of government agencies to fraudulently obtain travel expenses. It was learned that Zhang Yisan, who impersonated an inspector of this department, had been discovered in Jiangbei Xinghua County, where he fraudulently obtained travel expenses from the Construction Bureau. In addition to ordering the construction bureaus of various counties to pay attention, it is known that the world is not as it used to be, and there are often unscrupulous elements who use false names to swindle and deceive. It should be known that the personnel sent by this department to various counties for inspection all carry official documents and wear badges. Otherwise, they are impersonating and should be investigated, arrested, and severely punished to deter unscrupulous practices.</p>

Yesterday, the committee resolved to appoint Shen Bohan and Shen Yizhi to inspect the Jinji Lake Dike together with the Director of the Construction Bureau in order to determine the design and start construction as soon as possible. The committee's operating expenses were requested from the fund at the warehouse meeting. ▲Scheduled Memorial Service for Fallen Soldiers The Nineteenth Route Army Headquarters has scheduled a memorial service for the anti-Japanese fallen soldiers at the Suzhou Public Stadium on the 20th of this month, as reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that a preparatory committee was established on the 9th in the Suzhou Park Library. All personnel are assigned by the original editorial staff of the headquarters and personnel dispatched by various divisions. They are currently collecting anti-Japanese war trophies and historical materials of anti-Japanese battles. ▲Military Headquarters Move to Suzhou, Division Headquarters Move to Changzhou The 60th Division Command of the 19th Route Army was stationed in Suzhou. Now, it has been ordered to move to Changzhou for garrison duty on the 11th. Suzhou will be taken over by the 78th Division. Commander Shen has now appointed Chen Xinlu as the director of the division's rear guard office. The command sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau yesterday, stating that if officers and soldiers of the division stay in hotels in the future, regardless of whether they have leave passes, please detain them all. It is heard that the 19th Route Army Headquarters will move to Suzhou Wan on the evening of the 10th or the 11th. The location has been determined to be the Liuyuan on Wufu Road.</p>

<p>▲Recruitment of Female Workers Causes Turmoil Gan Jian Silk Factory, located under the Gongyun Bridge, posted recruitment conditions for new female workers on the 2nd of this month, stipulating that female workers with beautiful appearance, fashionable dress, and no pregnancy or children would be recruited into the factory. On the 4th, eight machines were started first. Upon hearing this news, the old female workers rose up in opposition and appealed to the Party and government agencies for assistance. Yesterday (the 9th) at 6:00 a.m., more than 200 old female workers, driven by livelihood concerns, all took the initiative to enter the factory to work. Seeing this, the factory, fearing trouble, reported to the 4th Detachment of the Business Corps. Upon receiving the report, the detachment immediately sent more than ten members, armed with guns, to suppress the situation. At that time, there was a loud noise, and people refused to be dissuaded. The Business Corps fired a volley of warning shots into the sky. Fortunately, no one was injured. The situation was tense, and the order was in chaos. After half an hour, the female workers dispersed like frightened birds. The factory owner, Cheng Bingruo, fearing that the turmoil would escalate, immediately suspended work and made proper arrangements for the aftermath.</p>

<p>▲Langshan is About to Collapse into the Yangtze River The riverbank of Nantong is collapsing severely recently. The Ministry of Transportation's survey and assessment of the dike stabilization project has not been implemented due to insufficient funds. The stone embankments originally built on the riverbank have gradually sunk. Langshan is getting closer to the river, and when the big flood comes, it will be swept into the river. Local sectors have submitted reports to the provincial and central governments, requesting prompt remediation.</p>

The back house of the Zhengtayuan Shaobing Shop, opened by a Wu family adjacent to the shop, also collapsed. It is estimated that old man Qiu and two boys, a worker, and a seven-year-old child were injured. The child suffered a severe waist injury and could not stand up. All have gone to the hospital for treatment and are not in danger of death. ▲Canal Project Repeatedly Robbed by Bandits The Director-General's Office for Pacification learned from Director Han Zeshi of the Jiangbei Canal Works Welfare Committee that thousands of bandits in the Sansha Zhiba area of Anhui Suibei County had abducted three ordinary soldiers and four barge workers on the 30th, and that the Bao Ying section of the project was looted by bandits on the 2nd, injuring worker Zhu Ronggui and seizing the security regiment's firearms. He requested that troops be ordered to suppress the bandits and protect the project. Yesterday (the 8th), Chief Liang was specially instructed to comply.</p>

<p>▲Shaoxing Salt Cancels Jiangxi Surtax Shaoxing salt merchants, due to the heavy salt surtax in Jiangxi Province's extensive jurisdiction, were unable to handle sales. They requested the Salt Transportation Office to forward a request to the Jiangxi Provincial Government to order all counties under its extensive jurisdiction to cancel all Zhejiang salt surtaxes within a time limit. After Transportation Envoy Zhou telegraphed the Jiangxi Provincial Government, a reply was received stating that the surtax on salt in the seven counties of Guangxin has been investigated and cancelled by telegram.</p>

<p>▲Silkworm Hatching Fire Kills Two People In the Xiashandai area of Xiaoshan South Township, the silkworm farmer Xia Jinfu's family, because the weather has been windy and rainy recently and the climate has turned cold, the spring silkworms have completed their third molt and mostly stopped making cocoons. They used fire to heat them. Unexpectedly, at midnight on the 9th, they accidentally caused the stove to ignite the silkworm hill. In an instant, the fire illuminated the sky and could not be approached. It is estimated that five buildings and four flats were completely burned down. Moreover, a five-year-old son and an eighty-year-old mother, because it was late at night, could not escape and died in the fire. The family's losses are no less than 10,000 yuan. ▲Elementary School Student Commits Suicide for National Crisis In the Hejiaqiao area near Linpu, Xiaoshan, a He family son named Yongkui, who was studying at Linpu Elementary School, suddenly met a friend who had returned from the front line and talked about national affairs and the various atrocities of Japan. Yongkui, upon hearing this, was filled with anger and indignation, and hanged himself at midnight on the 9th, leaving a letter detailing the reasons for his martyrdom for the country. When his family heard the news and went to save him, he had already died. The old mother in the hall, with her son dying for the country, was in a very tragic state.</p>

<p>▲Please Exempt from Increasing Business Tax Rates Various county chambers of commerce in this province stated that the provincial government will uniformly change the business tax rate for various industries from two per thousand to ten per thousand, which merchants and people cannot afford. They have requested the Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce to forward a request to the provincial government to sympathize with the difficulties of the merchants and withdraw the order. The association forwarded the request to the provincial government, but did not get the gist. Currently, the representatives of the chambers of commerce in various counties advocate that the Association of Commerce convene a congress of representatives of all Zhejiang chambers of commerce to jointly seek solutions. All Zhejiang businesses have sent letters to solicit opinions. If a majority agrees, it will be convened on schedule. It is also heard that the Hangzhou Municipal Chamber of Commerce has requested that the tea, silk, cloth, and medicine industries forward their requests to sympathize with the difficulties of the merchants and exempt them from the additional levy. It was submitted to the standing committee for resolution yesterday. After collecting the opinions of various industries, it will be discussed again and a method for exemption will be requested.</p>

<p>Dear Sirs, This morning I read in your newspaper a news item about Chen Mingshu and Jiang Guangnai telegraphing to Guangdong to mediate the dispute. It so happened that Minister Chen was in Shanghai, and I asked him about it. He said that he and Commander Jiang had not heard anything about the matters in Guangdong, and that the so-called mediation of the dispute was not the case. It is clear that someone is deliberately creating rumors, and he instructed me to send a letter requesting a correction. It is hoped that a clear and large font will be used to correct this in the original column of your newspaper. Sincerely, Fan Qiwu.</p>

<h3 id="e118">Ma Zhanshan's Triumphant Telegram <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>▲Details of Fierce Attack on Japanese Troops  Heilongjiang Chairman Ma Zhanshan yesterday telegraphed a certain prominent figure in this port, reporting in great detail the atrocities committed by the Japanese troops in Tonghe in recent days, and the actual situation of the joint siege of the enemy troops by the forces of Ding and Li. The original telegram is recorded below: (Telegram received with respect. I will respectfully follow your instructions to complete the entire organization in the shortest possible time. However, the atrocities of the Japanese army have recently increased even more. Previously, while our Tonghe garrison was cooperating with the troops of Ding and Li to advance on Tuhar, they took advantage of my Harbin Jiangfang fleet to secretly transport a large number of Japanese troops, bypassing our troops along the river route to attack my Tonghe, eventually burning down my streets and food, confiscating the firearms of my police force and the head of the Tonghe County Public Security Bureau and the head of the Chamber of Commerce, all of whom were imprisoned on warships. At one point, many women and children fleeing were stabbed to death with bayonets. In one case, the entire family of more than forty people in a certain surname's compound were all burned to death. There were also civilians hiding in cellars who were sealed off and burned to death without leaving any survivors. The inhumanity was extreme. When my forward troops received the report at the time, they immediately led their troops back to support, distributed in the suburbs, and then at midnight on the same day, they took advantage of the enemy's return to support and distributed in the suburbs, and at midnight on the same day, countless enemies were annihilated, and many weapons and ammunition were seized. In the end, because of the different situations on land and water, it was a pity that they could not be gathered and wiped out. Currently, the troops of Ding and Li are approaching Harbin, and my army has considerable contact with them. Zhanshan plans to personally supervise the army and boost morale in order to recover together. I respectfully report this for your attention. Ma Zhanshan Geng, Water Company</p>
<h3 id="e119">Urgent Notice Issued Yesterday <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>▲Water Will Be Shut Off at the End of the Month for Failure to Sign Contracts Under the New Regulations   ▲New Houses Cost Five Times More Than Under the Old System   ▲Real Estate Association Proposes a Fair Solution The British-owned Shanghai Public Concession Water Company is implementing a water meter system. After setting the price of water meters, the Real Estate Association resolutely opposed collecting it on their behalf, while the tenants opposed increasing the burden. The company issued an urgent notice to all sectors yesterday, stating that if contracts are not signed in accordance with the new regulations, water will be cut off at the end of this month. The Real Estate Association will hold a general meeting on the 14th to discuss how to deal with it and propose a method for installing water meters. The various situations are recorded as follows:   ▲Urgent Notice The British-owned Shanghai Water Company issued an urgent notice to all sectors yesterday, which read: "To whom it may concern, because the water supply agreement between our company and your users, which was previously based on a monthly flat rate, will expire on May 31, it is now invalid. We have sent a new contract for water supply calculated according to the water meter. If the new contract is not signed and returned to our company before the expiration date, the supply will be stopped immediately. If you have not received the new contract form that was previously sent, or if you have received it and lost it, please come to our company's general management office to collect a replacement."   ▲Proposed Solution The Real Estate Association wrote to the British-owned Shanghai Water Company, saying: "To whom it may concern, we previously received your letter dated December 7, 1931, regarding the installation of water meters. We believe that the matter is of great importance and requires detailed research before expressing our opinions, etc. We have heard about it, and now we will describe our exploration as follows: (1) Your company should pay attention to the following facts. According to the actual rent, 7.5% of the rent is for water, and the monthly water fee is 55 yuan. After installing water meters, the average monthly water fee is 290 yuan. If so, installing water meters will increase the water fee by more than five times compared to the flat-rate system, that is, from 7.5% to 37.5%. If the landlord has to pay this water fee on behalf of the tenant, then the landlord's actual rent for a 100-yuan flat-rate rent is more than 94 yuan, excluding surcharges, while the water meter system is only about 64 yuan. If the increased 30 yuan is transferred to the tenant's direct burden, then wouldn't the tenant who pays 100 yuan for rent, including water fees, have to bear a total of 130 yuan for water fees and rent? And the water fee will account for one-third of the rent, how will users make a living? This is a major problem in Shanghai. (2) The above-mentioned facts are implemented by your company, such as the collection of municipal general losses, and the methods of telephone, natural gas, and electricity are not related to real estate operators, but real estate operators are also water users, and they also have direct interests. Moreover, the common people account for a very large percentage of all users. When this association implements its claims, it has to make a statement on behalf of them, and it does not intend to emulate utilitarians who only seek no harm to themselves, but only transfer their harm to others and do not care. (3) Installing water meters to obtain fairness and save waste is a matter of course. This association absolutely agrees, and the principle of dividing the water rate into two types and taking into account the lives of the common people is even more the principle that modern social policies should have. However, this association believes that the cost and deposit of installing water meters should be borne by the landlord, which is absolutely different from the installation methods of telephones, electricity, and natural gas, and is even more in absolute conflict with legal principles. (4) The following methods should be used for installing water meters: (A) Each household in the existing houses must install one meter, and the cost and deposit should be borne by the user. After installing the water meter, the landlord should remove the water fee from the original flat-rate rent and only collect the actual rent. (B) All matters concerning the installation of water meters for each household in the new houses must be directly negotiated by the water company and the user, and the landlord shall not be responsible for any responsibilities. (5) Regardless of whether water meters are installed or not, all landlords have no obligation to collect or bear the usage fees on behalf of others in accordance with legal principles and the precedents of other public utilities. Before this method can be implemented, in any case, anything that increases the landlord's difficulties and expenses cannot be absolutely agreed. Correspondence is hereby made, and it is hoped that you will investigate accordingly. Postal Workers' Union and Employees' Union</p>
<h3 id="e120">Reaffirming the Plan to Consolidate the Postal Foundation <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>▲Continuing to Submit to the Ministry for Open Adoption   ▲Writing to All Sectors to Report the Facts In view of the increase in postage rates and the increased burden on the public, the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union and Employees' Union, based on their duty to serve and based on the past facts of the postal service, drafted an outline and reasons for a plan to consolidate the postal foundation, prepared a document and sent representatives to Beijing to make statements to the important organs of the Central National Government, and made more sincere proposals to the Ministry of Communications. They originally hoped to seek a method that would take into account both parties on the principle of national undertakings and the interests of the public, in order to build a great cause for a hundred years. Yesterday, the returning representatives reported that Chen Fumu, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Communications, expressed that he insisted on his personal position and seemed unwilling to openly and fully adopt the proposed plan. The two associations believe that if the Ministry of Communications does not accept the plan, the future of the postal service will be in great danger, and they unanimously decided to submit it to the Ministry of Communications again, requesting open adoption and immediate implementation, and issued a report to all sectors. The submitted document and the letter to all sectors are recorded below:   ▲Submitting to the Ministry to Request Approval of the Plan to Consolidate the Postal Foundation, Lay the Foundation for National Undertakings, Maintain the Interests of the Public, and Pray for Prompt Orders to Follow, in Order to Comfort the Public The members of the association, etc., dedicate themselves to the postal service, deeply aware of the difficulty of creating the postal service and remembering the harshness of the postal environment. Therefore, when the Ministry is implementing an increase in postage rates to expand the postal environment, we especially admire the Ministry's hard work in maintaining the postal service. We have gathered the experience of postal employees across the country who speak about the postal service, compiled the facts of the postal service's past history, analyzed the advantages and disadvantages, and weighed the importance. We have drafted a concrete plan to consolidate the postal foundation, with a total of three outlines and six items, and attached four reasons. The main points are: All postal surpluses should be used to develop the postal service and other necessary purposes, determine the principle of using the postal service to support the postal service, and implement special postal accounting to restore the postal service's economic resources and consolidate the postal service's economic foundation. The current postal service's deficit of four million should be quickly cut down by the Savings and Remittance Bureau and stop subsidies to airlines. The money saved can be gradually used to make up for the deficit. Increasing postage rates is not a fundamental solution to remedy the postal service. Moreover, increasing the burden only causes public criticism. Therefore, please temporarily maintain the original postage rates to maintain the people's faith. After the administrative reform is implemented, if there is a shortage, we will slowly find ways to remedy the economic shortage. Then the public will be able to understand the Ministry's hard work and be happy to bear the burden. This concerns consolidating the postal economy. The postal service's performance is fortunate to be maintained because of the integrity of the administrative system and the guarantee of employment. Therefore, it can maintain its independence and not be shocked by political tides. Since recent years, the postal savings and remittance business has been severely divided. The so-called Savings and Remittance Bureau, which is set up separately, uses the words "postal service," but the actual administrative management and the advancement and retreat of personnel all use the postal service system. It is almost like a corrupt parasitic institution. If the bureau is not quickly cut down and the savings and remittance business is still returned to the Postal General Bureau, and the original organization is merged and handled, then not only will the postal savings and remittance business be completely destroyed, and the people's savings will have no guarantee, but also the postal service's international status will be destroyed. The future of the postal service will be greatly hindered, and it is not just a matter of setting up parasitic institutions, abusing non-postal personnel, and increasing the postal service's huge burden. It is found that our country's transportation undertakings have been repeatedly affected by political tides and have all been damaged. The Ministry has presided over transportation administration, adopted the postal system, and ordered other transportation undertakings to gradually improve, help them develop, and support them forward. It is not possible to destroy the postal system and go with other transportation undertakings, and pull them back. As for how to maintain the independence of postal administration and the personnel treatment system, the plan has detailed them. This concerns consolidating the administration. The postal service's personnel treatment system is the only key factor for the postal service's prosperity. At first, the Ministry temporarily canceled the two-yuan subsidy that was related to the lives of all employees, and recently, we suddenly received the Ministry's Instruction No. 904, which strictly restricted the promotion methods, causing the feelings of the officials to be anxious and uneasy. The Association believes that restricting personnel promotion is to destroy the postal service's good system, and canceling the two-yuan subsidy is to destroy the guarantee of employees' treatment. This measure is contrary to the Ministry's original intention of expanding postal services. The Association cannot agree to it, and has repeatedly listed the reasons in detail in the case. However, after many days, we have not seen a clear order to cancel it. It seems that such repeated delays will not ease the employees. This concerns maintaining the personnel treatment system. The above three concerns are all related to the postal service's centennial plan. If one is missing, the postal service will not be able to stand on its own. Today, the Ministry initially resolutely increased postage rates, and then separately reviewed and reduced them, which shows the Ministry's determination to expand postal services. However, it is only concerned with the symptoms and does not seek the root cause. It is not the way to achieve a great undertaking. The Association is concerned that if postal administration and the economy are not maintained and the postal foundation is consolidated, the benefits of the reduction will be difficult to last, and the resentment of the increase will be gathered. The postal service itself will only become thinner and wither, and will eventually fall into a state of eternal doom. All the employees of the Association are closely related to each other, and they love and care more. They are wandering in five directions, not just for a day or two. For this reason, we risk everything to express our feelings and will not avoid any ministry to implement them. Then more than 30,000 employees will exhaust their minds and blood and will not avoid any difficulties to be the Ministry's backing and promote its realization. If there is further delay, the employees will be motivated by temporary indignation, and their actions may exceed the norm. The Association has the intention to love the postal service, but there is no way to suppress it. We hope that the Ministry will make a decisive decision and issue a clear order to follow it. The plan to consolidate the postal foundation will be implemented immediately, and the promotion restrictions will be canceled and the original two-yuan subsidy will be restored, so as to comfort the public and reassure the people. We cannot wait to be ordered. We respectfully submit this to the Minister and Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Communications.   ▲To All Sectors All agencies, people's organizations, and compatriots across the country: Our Chinese postal service, fortunately relying on a strict system, has gradually progressed over the past 30 years and has achieved good results. The society recognizes it as the only remaining transportation undertaking in our country. Later, through the efforts of postal employees across the country, we recovered postal rights and placed them under the management of the National Government's Ministry of Communications. We deeply hoped to vigorously revive and keep pace with Europe and the United States. However, since recent years, rights have been recovered, but the government has been deteriorating. Dividing the business and destroying the system have led to administrative differences and reduced efficiency. Moreover, successive transportation authorities have regarded the postal service as a financial agency and have spared no effort to withdraw postal construction and development funds for non-postal or other non-essential purposes, resulting in decades of painstaking management and the postal service's surplus turning into a deficit. Therefore, the authorities, in order to make up for the postal service's budget deficit, resolutely disregarded the survivors of the disaster and implemented an increase in postage rates, which increased the burden on the public. Alas, who is doing this? Who is causing this? All our compatriots should see this. The Association is deeply concerned about the deterioration of the postal foundation. The drawbacks may not be remedied by increasing the burden on the public. Therefore, we are forced to fulfill our duty to serve the society and based on our loyalty to maintain the undertaking, we have drafted a concrete plan to consolidate the postal foundation, with a total of three outlines and six items, and attached four reasons (the original plan is attached separately). We have already sincerely requested the Ministry of Communications to adopt it, so that it can be exempted from all undue burdens on the postal service, restore the postal service's economic resources, and maintain the integrity of the postal system and the stability of personnel treatment. Then the future of the postal service will gradually move towards brightness, and the order to recover the increase in postage rates, which compatriots from all walks of life have requested to reduce the burden, can be finally realized. The Association is considering the interests of the postal service, the society, the national undertaking, and the compatriots. We are wandering in five directions, not just for a day or two. Now that the postal foundation is in danger, we should gather the strength of the whole country to be the pioneers in consolidating the postal service. We will not avoid the difficulties and toil in order to compensate for the past negligence in maintenance. We hope that all sectors will appreciate our foolish sincerity and encourage us to achieve our goals. With this, we wish you peace and security. Sincerely, Shanghai Postal Workers' Union and Shanghai Postal Employees' Union</p>
<h3 id="e121">The General Labor Union's Telegram Questioning Chen Fumu <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>▲Blaming Him for His Careless Remarks The Municipal General Labor Union, for the fact that Chen Fumu, Deputy Minister of Communications, insulted the workers in his reply to the postal workers' petition representatives, specially sent a telegram yesterday to question him. The original telegram reads: "To Chen, Deputy Minister of Communications, Nanjing: According to reports, Mr. Chen replied to the postal workers' petition representatives, saying that the union was deliberately making trouble and was very hateful. This Deputy Minister would rather the postal service be shut down for one day, and even if the national transportation stopped for one year, he would not want these troublemakers to exist in the post office for one day," etc. This is absurd and extreme. The postal workers' petition was purely to support the postal service and contribute their opinions, and there was no other purpose in it. Moreover, the postal service is a state-run enterprise and cannot be compared with personal private property. However, Mr. Chen acted arbitrarily and made absurd remarks. If this causes serious disputes, then Mr. Chen should be held responsible. This is specially telegraphed to you. Sincerely, Shanghai General Labor Union"</p>

<p>When the war clouds were looming in Shanghai a few days ago, Guo Qiyuan, President of Southeast Medical University, rushed to Shanghai from Hubei to summon the school's graduates from all over the country to join the Red Cross and organize the Seventh Relief Team. They went through many dangers and rescued two or three hundred wounded soldiers and civilians. After the Nineteenth Route Army retreated in early March, the team was ordered to go to Kunshan and Suzhou to organize a rear hospital. For the past month, the war has stopped at the front, and all the Red Cross relief teams have been ordered to disband. The Seventh Team was specially ordered to continue working due to its outstanding performance, and to handle the unfinished business of the rear hospital. Yesterday, team members Shen Xunru and others came to Shanghai to tell reporters that Director Guo has ordered all team members to disband automatically in order to conclude the work, because the wounded soldiers in the hospital have all gradually recovered.</p>

<p>Madam Xiao, the mother of Xiao Deyi, a righteous man, had planned to go to Peiping on the 10th, but the trip was postponed because the matters being handled by various parties had not been completed. This was reported in this newspaper. Now, Tang Haian, a member of the Commendation Committee, and Yin Zhiling of the various groups' national salvation association, have confirmed that Madam Xiao has decided to cancel her trip to Peiping and will disembark from the New Customs Wharf at 11:00 a.m. on the 13th (Friday) to return to China on the President McKinley. At that time, various groups will send representatives to the port to present flowers and send her off. The United National Salvation Association of various groups has notified its 89 affiliated groups and the Shanghai Boy Scouts Council.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Continued News on the Commercial Press Employees' Layoff Wave <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>▲Second Petition to the Municipal Government   ▲General Meeting of Employees of the Publishing House The employees of the Commercial Press, because they petitioned the municipal government the day before yesterday and Mayor Wu did not meet with them, decided to go again this morning. At one time, more than 700 people gathered. The Aftermath Committee of the employees of the press was deeply afraid that too many people would cause trouble, so it appointed Feng Jifang, Zhu Gongchui, Hu Jinshan, Pan Ronglin, Liu Chongru, and Wang Shoukang as representatives to go to the municipal government at 10:00 a.m. Because Mayor Wu Tiecheng was out on official business, Secretary-General Yu Hongjun met with them. The six representatives raised two points: (1) Please the municipal government withdraw its order. (2) Instruct the Social Affairs Bureau to order the capitalists to revoke the layoff notice. Secretary-General Yu replied that the municipal government and the labor side are inevitably alienated, but the order has been issued, and for the sake of credibility, it is not appropriate to comply. If there is an order from the Executive Yuan, the government will follow it. He also said that if your association goes to the Executive Yuan, I will assist in a personal capacity, and his attitude was very sincere. The association is now planning to file a lawsuit in court and go to the Executive Yuan to petition. In addition, the employees of the publishing house also convened a general meeting of members at the Central Western Restaurant yesterday (the 11th) at 2:00 p.m. More than 200 members attended. Chairman Ma Weiqun, after Liu Chongru, Li Changsheng, and others reported on the association's affairs, resolved (1) to ask the executive committee to continue to fight in accordance with the established steps, (2) to never receive severance pay from the company, (3) if the association's fund has a proper use, the executive committee will apply to the fund custody committee to receive it. The association's fundraising committee has raised a lot of money and goods in recent days. According to the association's newspaper thank-you announcement: "Since our association members have suffered national disaster, and have been displaced and wandering for three months, and have recently been oppressed by capitalists and laid off as a whole, they are extremely distressed. We are grateful to people from all walks of life for donating goods and funds to avoid drowning. We would like to report first to express our gratitude. Mr. Zhu Ziqiao donated 200 dan of rice, Mr. Du Yuesheng donated 50 dan of white rice, the Shanghai Citizens' Local Maintenance Association donated 500 catties of pickled vegetables, and 10 jars, 10 jars of fermented bean curd, 7 bags of salted fish, the Chinese Red Cross Society donated 100 quilts and four bags of old clothes, the colleagues of the China Book Company donated 105 yuan, one jiao and seven fen, and the colleagues of the Aftermath Office of the Business Library donated more than 100 yuan. The association will publish a thank-you announcement in the near future. The Commercial Press</p>
<h3 id="e125">Resumption of Business Is Still Undetermined <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, various newspapers carried the news that the Commercial Press would resume business on a regular basis. In order to clarify the truth, the reporter visited a certain official of the press. According to him, this news is completely untrue. The press's main factory was destroyed and shut down. The Hong Kong and Peiping branch factories have not stopped work and have not expanded their scope. As for the building above the Yunfei Motor Company on Jing'an Temple Road in Shanghai, it is temporarily rented by the press to store the remaining machines, and the area is very small. It is not a factory, but the outside world has rumored that a new factory has been set up. As for the report that the press's publishing house on Qipan Street will resume business as usual on the first of next month, it is even more untrue. In short, the issue of the resumption of business of the press cannot be discussed at present.</p>

<p>▲Municipal Health Bureau Advises to Get Vaccinated Quickly According to the Municipal Health Bureau, cholera patients have been found in the city on April 26. It should be noted that in recent years, there has been no cholera outbreak in the city in April. Therefore, the bureau is paying close attention and sending personnel to various places to conduct thorough investigations and collect feces from suspected patients and send them to the test laboratory for testing. As of May 10, it has been tested and proven that there are already nine people suffering from cholera. Six of them live in the Public Concession, and three live in Zhabei in this city. The above nine patients are now being held in the epidemic hospital. Therefore, the bureau has already begun to implement free cholera vaccination and advised citizens to get vaccinated as soon as possible. It is said that this year the disease was discovered so early and is the most easily spread and severe infectious disease. As the saying goes, "After a great war, there must be a great epidemic." It is feared that this will be realized in the city this year, so citizens should get vaccinated to facilitate prevention.</p>

<p>▲Municipal Chamber of Commerce Will Introduce on Behalf The Municipal Chamber of Commerce wrote to the Shanghai National Products Factory Federation, saying, "We have received a letter from the Chinese Chamber of Commerce of Fiji, stating that Japanese goods account for the majority of goods traded in the Nanyang Islands. All wholesale and retail sales in the business world, directly and indirectly, are promoted by our overseas Chinese. The annual imports are millions, but only one or two of our domestic goods can be found, almost like phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. The reason for this is that although the cost of our country's goods is heavier and cannot compete with them, it is also due to the lack of domestic and foreign promotion and the deprivation of rights and interests, which is very regrettable. At this time of expensive gold and cheap silver, it is an opportunity for domestic goods to compete in foreign markets. It is still time for the Chinese people to rise up and catch up. However, our association is located in a remote corner of the sea and has inconvenient transportation. It is very alienated from domestic products. Please introduce them widely." The overseas Chinese in Fiji are collecting domestic goods to replace Japanese goods because of the Japanese people's atrocities. This is a good opportunity to promote domestic goods. Please forward this to your members. If you are willing to sell goods there, you can contact the Chamber of Commerce there to handle it. Shipping Industry</p>
<h3 id="e129">Request to Reclaim Navigation Mark Ownership <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Shipping Industry Association, the Joint Office of the Nine Public Shipping Companies, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and five other organizations have jointly submitted a request to the National Government's Executive Yuan and Ministry of Transportation regarding the reorganization of navigation marks on the Yangtze River, in preparation for reclaiming navigation rights in the future. Yesterday (the 11th), they jointly submitted separate petitions, requesting that the responsibility for the Yangtze River navigation marks be transferred to the Ministry for management and reorganization. The contents of the petition are excerpted below:</p>
<p>Presenting a petition for the reorganization of navigation marks on the Yangtze River, to facilitate transportation and safeguard sovereignty: It is noted that navigation marks are originally intended to facilitate navigation and indicate routes, and are of utmost importance to the safety of ships on the water. The navigation marks on China's Yangtze River have long been managed by the Customs Service. However, over time, this has become a mere formality. The existing facilities are incomplete, and the authority to manage these marks is in the hands of foreigners in the Customs Service, who are isolated from the situation of China's shipping industry and cannot be expected to improve it. The circumstances are detailed below for your review:</p>
<p>(1) The Customs Service manages the Yangtze River navigation marks by establishing a River Patrol Office, employing foreigners to fill positions. However, some of these foreigners are not familiar with river and sea conditions and are merely filling positions without competence. Technically unqualified, the various navigation marks they have established are often impractical. In this era of advancing science and technology, with daily improvements in equipment, the Customs Service has made no new investments in Yangtze River navigation marks. Even the navigation marks in inland ports along the river have not been increased to this day, leaving shipping merchants with only the obligation to pay ship dues, without enjoying the benefits of navigation.</p>
<p>(2) Navigation marks serve navigation, having a close relationship with pilots. However, since the Customs Service's River Patrol Office and other personnel are foreign nationals, they are detached from Chinese personnel, leading to frequent communication barriers and preventing cooperation with pilots to improve navigation. Moreover, foreign Customs officials often disregard the interests of Chinese shipping businesses, focusing solely on expanding their authority and controlling maritime administration.</p>
<p>(3) The Customs Service collects millions in tonnage dues from steamships annually for managing navigation marks. However, foreign staff waste expenses, with no tangible results. They have only installed a small number of lighthouses, lightships, and light buoys along the river, neglecting critical tasks such as charting the river's flow, water levels, and sectional maps. Recently, ship accidents and groundings have frequently occurred, causing passengers to feel insecure and fearful, significantly impacting the future of the shipping industry.</p>
<p>(4) Our treaties state that consuls should negotiate with major trading areas regarding the establishment of towers and markers to indicate navigation routes along the coast. The Yangtze River, however, is an inland waterway. Treaties between China and Britain and China and Japan only permit ships of those countries to navigate the river and do not include provisions for establishing navigation marks or management by the Customs Service along the river. The Customs Service has managed Yangtze River navigation marks for decades, effectively relinquishing sovereignty to an extreme degree. Navigation marks are a matter of transportation administration, while the Customs Service is a tax collection agency. The National Government has established a Navigation Administration Department under the Ministry of Transportation, which is responsible for the establishment and management of navigation marks. Therefore, the responsibility should be reclaimed for self-management and reorganization.</p>
<p>Based on the above reasons, the Yangtze River navigation marks are a matter of national sovereignty. The fact that the Customs Service has managed them for years represents a loss of authority and has produced unimpressive results. At this time of national construction and comprehensive reform, we earnestly request that your esteemed Executive Yuan and relevant ministries consider public opinion, transfer the management of these marks to the Ministry of Transportation, and order active reorganization, improve navigation facilities, and increase the number of navigation marks in inland ports. This will facilitate cooperation between shipping merchants and pilots, jointly promote the development of the shipping industry and ensure the safety of water transportation. Whether this is appropriate, we hereby respectfully submit this petition to the Chairman of the National Government, Lin, the Premier of the Executive Yuan, Wang, and the Minister of Transportation, Chen, for your review and implementation, which would be in the public interest.</p>

<p>▲ Ahn Did Not Go on a Hunger Strike in Prison: Mainland News Reports state that Korean revolutionary leader Ahn Changho is currently detained at the Japanese Consulate. Yesterday (the 10th), a Western friend visited him and found his spirits good. Rumors of a hunger strike in prison are said to be unconfirmed. It is said that after being arrested at a friend's house, Japanese police rushed him away, preventing him from retrieving his dentures. As a result, he can only eat soft foods at this time; he cannot eat anything hard. Furthermore, local sources in Japan received a telegram from a Korean organization in Los Angeles, USA, addressed to the Provisional Government of Korea, stating that Korean expatriates across the United States are making every effort to lobby American dignitaries to rescue Ahn Changho, and that Korean expatriates in Shanghai should not be disappointed.</p>
<p>The Ta Mei Evening News reports that Mr. Li, the president of the Korean Expatriate Association, submitted a letter to French legal officer Weili De yesterday, requesting redress for the French Concession police's violation of international norms regarding the protection of political prisoners by allowing Japanese police to arbitrarily arrest Korean expatriates in the Concession. The letter stated that Ahn Changho, who had acquired Chinese nationality, was arrested by Japanese police in the French Concession, and the arrest warrant was issued after the fact. Furthermore, a Korean woman was beaten during a search and forced to reveal her husband's whereabouts, and two other Koreans had their bank passbooks confiscated. A Chinese servant of the Korean Expatriate Association, Mr. Xia, was labeled a Communist and taken away by Japanese police. Moreover, a Korean pastor, Mr. Zhao, residing at No. 24 Rue Tenant de la Tour, had valuables worth 900 yuan taken away by Japanese police. The letter requested the immediate withdrawal of the arrest warrants for members of the Korean Independence Party and ordered the Japanese police to return the confiscated valuables, respectfully appealing in the name of France's constitution, which respects humanity and fairness.</p>
<p>Another letter was sent to American Minister Johnson, describing the circumstances of Ahn Changho's detention and stating that Ahn's wife and four children are all American citizens residing in Los Angeles. Ahn himself had acquired Chinese nationality. The letter requested that the minister inquire with the French Consul General in Shanghai about the details of Ahn's illegal arrest by the French police and consult with the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai to have Ahn tried publicly.</p>

<p>The Fujian Overseas Associations Relief Federation in Shanghai, citing the rampant activities of communist bandits in Fujian Province, the fall of Zhangzhou and Longyan, and the suffering of the people, resolved yesterday to send representatives to Nanjing and Guangzhou to request military assistance. They also sent telegrams to various authorities, which are excerpted below:</p>
<p>(1) Telegram to the Fujian Provincial Government: To Chairman Fang of the Fujian Provincial Government, with deepest respect: The communist disaster is worsening daily, the people are suffering, and our homeland is in despair, which deeply saddens us. It is your duty to urgently summon the existing troops in the province, coordinate with national forces to suppress the bandits, and devise effective measures to eliminate the communist scourge. If you continue to delay and stand idly by, how will you face the people of Fujian? Our association has already telegraphed the authorities, requesting the dispatch of troops to aid Fujian and recover lost territory. We earnestly hope that you will promptly devise a solution to alleviate the suffering of the people.</p>

<p>(2) Telegram to Division Commander Zhang: To Division Commander Zhang Ganzhi, with deepest respect: The fall of Zhangzhou and Longyan and the spread of communist flames are regrettable, but your army's retreat and stationing in Yunxiao are unavoidable. We earnestly hope that you will firmly defend your current position and not retreat lightly to prevent the communist disaster from spreading and causing suffering to the people. This is our sincere prayer.</p>

<p>(3) Telegram to Brigade Commander Chen of the Fujian Provincial Defense Force: To Brigade Commander Chen Guohui of the Fujian Provincial Defense Force, with deepest respect: The tragic fall of Zhangzhou and the worsening communist disaster necessitate the strengthening of troops stationed in Quanzhou under your command to intercept the communists and prevent their spread.

<h3 id="e133">Jing'an Temple on Bathing the Buddha Festival <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Tomorrow (the 13th) is the eighth day of the fourth lunar month, traditionally known as the Bathing the Buddha Festival, which marks the birth of the Buddha Sakyamuni. Jing'an Temple, a famous ancient temple in Shanghai, holds a grand temple fair every year on this festival. Men and women, old and young, from hundreds of miles around, flock to the temple in an endless stream to offer incense and worship, crowding shoulder to shoulder. Its grandeur far surpasses that of Putuo and Lingyin. As a result, small vendors from the surrounding villages compete to set up stalls here to sell handicrafts. The roads around the temple are extremely crowded.</p>
<p>Last year, the Municipal Council issued a notice to ban street vendors. After the temple's abbot, Zhi Fa, vigorously negotiated, both parties finally reached an agreement, designating specific locations for vendors, thereby expanding the scope. Therefore, there are even more vendors this year. On Jing'an Temple Road, Hart Road, Haig Road, Avenue Road, Yuyuan Road, Jiaozhou Road, and Jessfield Road, there are no less than three thousand stalls. The items sold are mostly woodware, bamboo ware, rattan ware, pottery, cotton thread products, and toys. Both Chinese and foreigners enjoy buying them, as they are souvenirs filled with the essence of Chinese culture, sold in a temple fair that has been passed down for thousands of years in China.</p>
<p>The stallholders are grateful for Abbot Zhi Fa's efforts in negotiation and protection and plan to jointly contribute funds to send the temple a souvenir. They also plan to decorate the outside of the temple with lanterns and colored streamers and build a pine and cypress archway to enhance its beauty. However, Zhi Fa believes that because the country is in trouble, the people are suffering, and the Shanghai market has not yet recovered, the temple should not be extravagant. Moreover, the temple has established a refugee shelter, housing more than two thousand refugees, relying entirely on private donations from benefactors and receiving no assistance from other large charitable organizations. Now that the peace agreement has been signed and the Bathing the Buddha Festival is approaching, the refugees had to be given money and rice a few days before the festival and sent away to facilitate the cleaning of the halls so that worshipers from all directions could offer incense and worship. Although there are still about two hundred refugees left in the temple, every time the departed are thought of, they are alone and without homes to return to, causing tears to flow. Therefore, wasteful spending is particularly unbearable.</p>
<p>For this reason, the temple is not as decorated as in previous years but is open to all, allowing people to contribute as they wish and providing tea and vegetarian snacks to benefactors. Anyone wishing to study the grand occasion of Shanghai's Bathing the Buddha Festival must visit Jing'an Temple. Opium Public Sale in Progress.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Anti-Drug Association's Tearful Plea <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>▲ Urgently Call on National Organizations to Rise Up in Protest: The China National Anti-Drug Association believes that the central authorities in charge of opium prohibition have recently restored the public sale system, and the atmosphere is becoming increasingly intense. The authorities' sinister intentions have been completely exposed. Currently, soil smuggling officials are colluding with each other and proceeding with their plans. It is expected that the date of implementation is not far off. Therefore, it is especially important to ask important groups of local and national people to continue striving to curb the secret activities of villains and prevent the implementation of the public sale policy. The original text is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(To all recipients, the opium disaster in China will make the country no longer a country. Decadence and destruction are imminent. However, the central authorities and the civil and military officials of various provinces are not concerned about the crisis in the country but covet the profits of the drug. The brewing and implementation of opium public sales is not just a one time event. More recently, at a time when the country is in great trouble due to the invasion of violent Japan and the eyes of the people are focused on foreign affairs, they see the opportunity and have announced the public sale of opium. The Anhui Province Opium Prohibition Investigation Department has not been abolished, and the Min Province Prohibited Goods Inspection Department has risen one after another. Although the public unanimously opposed it, it was changed to the Mawei Inspection Department, but it is still a disguised public sale agency. Hubei and Hunan have established a special tax office in the two lakes, and Hebei, Chahar, and Suiyuan have established a northern company, which is the general office for public sales in the four provinces, issuing destruction certificates similar to stamps. Once purchased and posted, the transportation and sale of opium can proceed unimpeded and is protected by the police and military. More than 3,000 tons of opium soil have arrived in Tianjin. The provinces of Yunnan, Sichuan, Guangdong, and Guangxi are the source of public sales. The abolition of opium prohibition, the encouragement of planting, and the collection of donations have been accumulated for many years.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>In summary, the only provinces in the country that have not implemented public sales are Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shandong. It is heard that Jiangsu and Zhejiang are also trending towards adopting a public sales policy and are currently secretly proceeding. Wu Liande, the person who proposed the public sale of opium, and the central opium prohibition authorities are now running around in Beijing and Shanghai, trying their best to restore and connect with the corrupt opium mongers, gathering like ants at the gates of power, secretly engaging in activities. On the Shanghai side, a director from a certain department in Jiangsu Province came to Shanghai and negotiated with a certain company on a 1 million yuan per month donation package. The insidious plan is advancing, with the intention of igniting it again. It is heard that in the near future, the central government will implement public sales, which will surely become a reality. A few days ago, Gao Youtang, a member of the Control Yuan, had fully exposed the crimes of Liu Ruiheng of the Opium Prohibition Committee, who advocated public sales and indulged in the harm of drugs to the people, and filed an impeachment. This shows that the central government's appointment of treacherous officials and the restoration of unpopular policies is not just a rumor. There is nothing more painful. This association is responsible for rejecting drugs and will die for it. At this time of danger, it is difficult to remain silent. We will call out and resist, sparing no effort, and prepare for great sacrifices to fight it to the end. We have always admired your association's enthusiasm for national affairs and hatred of drugs. We dare to ask you to call out loudly, raise your arms and shout, awaken the people of the country, and jointly clear the demons, so that the government authorities can awaken from the standpoint of pure people, and achieve the goal of permanently abolishing public sales, to be the first voice of the people's self-determination. The future of opium prohibition is extremely fortunate, The China National Anti-Drug Association Qi) Nanyang Bridge.</p>

<p>▲ Yesterday's Letter to the French General Inspectorate of the French Concession: The Nanyang Bridge Business Federation of the French Concession stated that the iron gate at the border between China and France is still closed, which hinders transportation. Yesterday, a letter was sent to the French General Inspectorate requesting its opening. The original letter stated:</p>
<p>(To the recipients, according to a joint letter from 20 stores, including Yu Hengchang Silk Cloth Store, located in the area of ​​the intersection of Minquan Road and Huacheng Road, the losses suffered by our stores since the outbreak of the war in Shanghai were not small. The French authorities closed the iron gates at various key intersections on the border between China and France to ensure the safety of citizens in the concession, cutting off traffic. Although our location is within the concession, it happens to be outside the iron gate. During the January 28 Incident, the entire city went on strike. Although we reluctantly reopened, no customers patronized us every day. The reason is that the iron gate is closed, traffic is cut off, and customers cannot enter or exit. It is understood that places such as Nanyang Bridge and Pishao Nai Road on the border between China and France have been opened. The iron gate at the intersection of Huacheng Road, where we are located, is still closed. Now that the peace has been achieved, in order to revitalize the market, the iron gate should be opened immediately so that the people in the concession can freely enter and exit, and our business can take advantage of this to prosper. For this reason, we have sent a joint letter, asking your association to promptly forward the request to the French authorities to open the iron gate at the intersection of Huacheng Road on the same day to maintain the interests of commerce, which is in the public interest. According to the claims from Yuda Pawnshop and Hongsheng and other entities from the intersection of Route Lafayette and Route Lamber, requesting the opening of the iron gate at the intersection of Route Lafayette. According to this, the current situation has calmed down, and the above-mentioned articles stated by the commercial firms are necessary for opening the iron gates. For this reason, we have written a special letter to inform you, hoping that the General Inspector will review and approve it quickly to have the iron gates at Huasheng Road Minquan Road and Route Lafayette and Route Lamber opened on the same day to facilitate traffic and promote the market, to be an indication of public interest. This is respectfully submitted to the French General Inspectorate and General Director Faber, Nanyang Bridge Commercial Federation, May 11.)</p>

<p>The Shanghai Qinghua Alumni Association held a banquet at the Bank Association the night before yesterday in honor of Qinghua President Mei Yiqi and Ren Duyong, an executive of the China Education and Culture Foundation. Association President Cai Jinping presided over the event, and Sichuan entrepreneur Lu Zuofu was specially invited to give a lecture, which was recorded by Yang Bingxun. He stated that Sichuan's enterprises can be divided into three types: economic, security, and cultural.</p>
<p>Economically, the Minsheng Company is the main body. When it was founded, its capital was only 8,000 yuan, but now it has 550,000 yuan. The company focuses on shipping, power plants, coal mines, and the implementation of cooperative systems.</p>
<p>In terms of security, Sichuan has never experienced natural disasters, and the people have considerable self-defense capabilities. However, banditry is rampant in various places, and even the army cannot easily pass through. In the past one or two years, most of the bandits have been eliminated. The most important task now is to transform soldiers into civilians so that retired soldiers have considerable employment opportunities.</p>
<p>Culturally, there is the establishment of the Northwest Academy of Sciences, which focuses on the investigation of coal and iron in Sichuan and the training of accounting, secretarial, statistical, and management talents.</p>
<p>Finally, he said that although Sichuan's enterprise development often encounters difficulties, there are no roads that are impassable. Fang Dong</p>

<p>▲ Ye Zengxiang Requests Assistance: Ye Zengxiang from Ningbo opened a Fushengyuan paper shop on Fusheng Road, and the business was not bad. During the Shanghai Incident, the shop was located on the front line and suffered heavy losses. Now that the ceasefire conference has been successful and the Japanese troops have withdrawn, the shop owner plans to reopen the business immediately and go to reorganize. Unexpectedly, the Tang Zhongji agency, which manages the house, refused to renew the lease and ordered the Indian gatekeepers to dismantle the shop's assets without authorization at 2 pm yesterday. The situation was fierce at the time, and passers-by were indignant. However, the authorities have not yet recovered the power of the place, so the shop owner has no way to appeal and went to the Ningbo Association in Shanghai and the Rent Reduction Movement to request assistance. At the same time, a lawyer was hired to file a complaint.</p>

<p>Since the Japanese invasion of Zhabei on January 28, public opinion and political propaganda newspapers and periodicals in Shanghai have sprung up like bamboo shoots after rain. It has now been discovered by the French Concession Police Department's Political Department that the Dahua Evening News, founded by a certain politician, contains fierce language and is mostly reactionary text attacking the government, which violates the regulations. It was discovered that the newspaper's editorial department is located at No. 6 Huabao Lane, Lage Lane, with Luo Gusun from Henan serving as the editor-in-chief, and that it is printed by the Qinye Printing House, which is located at No. 82 Gloc Road and opened by Fan Fuzhi. Therefore, at 9 pm the night before last, the detectives went to the printing house, arrested Fan, and seized 1,000 copies of the Dahua Evening News (May 9) and two plates of the day's lead type. At 11 pm, they went to the editorial department, arrested Luo Gusun, and seized 18 copies of the newspaper and a large package of letters and manuscripts, which were brought to the police station together. Yesterday, they were sent to the Fourth Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. The police lawyer, Fei Xizhen, explained the case, stating that the defendants published a reactionary newspaper, and now they are being prosecuted in accordance with Articles 7, 13, 19, and 35 of the Publication Law and the various points stipulated in the French Consul's Order No. 187, requesting an investigation and submitting the newspaper as evidence. When the defendants were interrogated, they admitted to running the newspaper and printing it but denied being reactionary. A lawyer was hired to defend them. After reviewing the statements, the court announced that the hearing would be continued at a later date.</p>

<p>▲ Zhang Qingxiang Denies Killing Brother ▲ Claims Culprit is Someone Else</p>
<p>Zhang Qingxiang, from Huayuan Shiqiao in Pudong, and his maternal uncle, Zhang Quansheng, and his mother, Zhang Zhang, were prosecuted for murdering his biological brother, Zhang Yuxiang, and injuring his half-brother, Zhang Guoxiang, over an inheritance. The District Court's investigation determined the facts, and Zhang Qingxiang, Zhang Quansheng, and Zhang Zhang were publicly prosecuted for murder. A handgun that Zhang Quansheng had burned was also seized as evidence.</p>
<p>The defendant's side hired many lawyers to defend, absolutely denying the matter and saying that although Zhang Yuxiang was shot and killed, the murderer was someone else. The gun scars on Zhang Guoxiang's neck were claimed to be scrofula. However, the court's forensic doctor had examined them and the Baolong Hospital had taken photos to prove them. In order to be as detailed as possible, the court continued the trial yesterday morning, presided over by Judge Shen, and summoned Huang Rongzeng, a doctor from Baolong Hospital, to testify that Zhang Guoxiang was indeed shot at the time and that the scars were caused by surgery to remove the bullets. Liu Chen, Zhang Guoxiang's landlady, also testified in court, saying that one minute before the incident, Qingxiang came to her house to ask where Zhang Guoxiang had gone and what his housemates knew. However, Zhang Zhang and Zhang Jiayi, the owner of the shoe store, witnesses for Zhang Qingxiang, stated that Qingxiang was buying shoes that night. Because more witnesses needed to be summoned, the court ordered another hearing and remanded the defendants in custody. A famous gangster in the Xinzha district.</p>

<p>Among the 59 male and female suspects in the large number of theft cases successively apprehended by the Xinzha Police Department a month ago, 36 who were found to be unrelated were released by the First Special District Court after investigation. The remaining 21 men, including Sun Honggui, Wang Zixiang, Xin Fayu, Lu Ruicheng, Han Xiaolong, Sun Qiyou, Lin Shihua, Gu Zhiheng, Mao Laohu, Yang Yongsheng, Xu Maokun, Xu Yueming, Gong Sangong, Li Lantian, Cao Zilin, Ding Xiaodi, Qi Zengfu, Shen Tongnan, Wang Yinfu, Yang Agen, and Wang Zaiqiu, and the two women, Wang Zhang and Wang Quan, were still detained for trial. The details have been recorded in the newspapers many times.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, Judge Feng Shide continued the trial, with defense attorneys Fan Gang, E Sen, Jiang Yiping, Shan Yuhua, and Bao Zhenhuang, as well as police attorney Wang Yaotang, attending successively. Judge Feng still ordered the individual interrogation of the defendants for each of the charged cases.</p>
<p>The police attorney stated that after investigation, Sun Honggui was found to have committed other robbery cases with Deng Youcai. Deng was also arrested, but his case is being heard by Judge Wu Tingqi. It is requested that Sun's case be combined into that case and also be heard by Judge Wu to avoid discrepancies. Judge Feng approved the request and ordered the police to take Sun away.</p>
<p>Li Lantian was then brought to the case. The police attorney stated that Li is a famous gangster in the Xinzha district. For the past few years, he has specialized in extortion, and the merchants in the district have mostly been victimized by him. The police have long wanted to arrest him, but because his gang is very large and well-informed, it is difficult to catch him. After his arrest this time, it was discovered that on July 28 of last year, Xu Wang and Wang Xu, sisters-in-law residing on Shanhai Road, had a quarrel and each hired gangsters to go to Xiyuan on Xinzha Road to have tea. In one case, a gangster fired three shots in a row, and Li was on guard at the scene. Furthermore, on the morning of March 17 of this year, there was a case of gangsters firing guns along the way on Xizang Road, and Li was also involved. A strict investigation should be requested. The Western Detective also reported that after Li was arrested this time, merchants in the district reported various illegal acts he had committed and demanded punishment. Cai Xinghe, a waiter at Xiyuan Teahouse, testified that Wang Xu and others hired people to drink tea and that the gangsters fired guns. However, he said that Li was not at the scene that day. Although Wang Xu and others were also summoned, they denied drinking tea and shooting. When questioned, Li Lantian claimed that he had been a detective in the Kunshan County Public Security Bureau since March of last year. He denied all the alleged cases. Judge Feng then ordered Xin Fayu, Lu Ruicheng, Han Xiaolong, and others to be questioned about the circumstances of the case in which they ganged up with weapons to rob the Dai Chunlin Perfumery on Xinzha Road of banknotes and foreign money on October 23 of the 19th year. By the time the interrogation was over, it was dusk, so the judge ordered that the defendants remain in custody and adjourned the hearing.</p>

<p>The bandit Su Jinsheng from Yangzhou, between February 29 and March 6, ganged up with Wang Qingyuan from Haimen, who had been arrested and punished, and others, to rob Zhang Zhouda's flat on Pingliang Road, the nun Xinyun's Sanguantang on Ningwu Road, Lu Wang's flat on Lujiazhai on Yangshupu Road, and Feng Zilin's residence in a flat on Linqing Road, escaping with more than 400 yuan worth of property. The case was reported, and the Huatang detectives Xie Wanfang and Liu Changgen of the Yangshupu Police Department arrested and sent them to the First Special District Court for investigation and detention.</p>
<p>At the continued hearing yesterday morning, police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that the defendant had confessed to robbing the families' properties in the police station and requested strict punishment. When questioned, the defendant denied the second robbery case and claimed that it was Yang, who was at large, who invited him. After discussion, Judge Qiao Wanxuan sentenced Su Jinsheng to nine years in prison. The number of days detained before the final judgment shall be converted into one day of imprisonment for every two days of detention.</p>

<p>After the Shanghai Incident, various charitable organizations in this city rescued countless compatriots from the war zones and sheltered them in Shanghai. Now, with the withdrawal of Japanese troops and the gradual restoration of local order, the shelters are closing one after another. Among the refugees, many have been impoverished and rendered homeless due to the impact of the war. If they are left to wander in foreign lands without a proper plan for their resettlement, it will have a significant impact on social security and the livelihoods of the people. It is now reported that Pan Yangyao and Chen Shudong of the China Vocational Education Society are planning to raise substantial funds to establish refugee factories, specifically to employ unemployed refugees in the manufacturing of handicrafts, in order to sustain their livelihoods. The plan is currently underway and is expected to materialize soon.</p>

<p>Since some of the invited members of the National Crisis Conference put forward the proposal to end party rule and implement democracy, the issue of tutelage versus constitutionalism has gradually attracted serious attention in society. Kuomintang leaders such as Wang Jingwei, Hu Hanmin, Sun Ke, and Yu Youren have all expressed their opinions. Wang and Yu oppose ending tutelage, while Sun supports it. Hu's attitude is unclear. As someone who studies politics and advocates for ending tutelage and implementing constitutionalism, I cannot help but offer my humble opinion on this important issue.</p>
<p>The reasons why Wang and Yu oppose ending tutelage can be analyzed into four points: (1) They believe that the Chinese people are too uneducated to practice democracy and implement constitutionalism without the Kuomintang's tutelage. (2) They believe that without the Kuomintang, there would be no Republic of China; destroying tutelage would be destroying the Kuomintang; and destroying the Kuomintang would be destroying the Republic of China. (3) They believe that past constitutionalism had poor results, so constitutionalism should not be implemented now. (4) They believe that some of the people advocating for constitutionalism now are former (bureaucratic politicians) who are not qualified to talk about party politics.</p>
<p>First, let's discuss the first reason for opposing the end of tutelage: the belief that the Chinese people are too uneducated to practice democracy and implement constitutionalism without the Kuomintang's tutelage. This reason must be based on at least the following foundations to be self-consistent: (1) The Kuomintang itself is sound. (2) The Kuomintang members are the best and brightest in the country. (3) The Kuomintang has had great achievements in the past. If the Kuomintang itself is divided and lacks a whole party organization, party will, and party policy, how can it "tutor"? If the Kuomintang itself is full of new and old bureaucratic politicians and warlords, not only are they not the best and brightest in the country, but many are even social outcasts, then how can they "tutor"? If five years of tutelage has led to the loss of sovereignty and national humiliation, endless internal strife, bandits everywhere, and corrupt officials throughout the country, bringing the nation to the brink of collapse and the people to the brink of starvation, how can we continue to "tutor" like this? These are objective facts that cannot be denied or concealed. Whether the Kuomintang can tutor and should continue to tutor depends on whether it possesses the above three conditions; otherwise, the Kuomintang is not qualified to talk about tutelage and should end tutelage.</p>
<p>The fundamental theory of tutelage originates from "rule by the wise," which should be carried out by the "wise" tutoring the "unworthy" and by a minority ruling the majority. But who are the "wise" among those few, and who are the "unworthy" among those many? This is a question that proponents of aristocratic politics in the past and proponents of the tutelage system today cannot answer. The theory of aristocratic politics failed here, and the theory of tutelage politics also fails here. Aristocratic politics is a political system in which a minority wields political power and most citizens have no opportunity to participate in politics. Therefore, the Kuomintang's tutelage today can also be said to be a form of aristocratic politics. Some proponents of aristocratic politics base it on bloodline, saying that a minority of hereditary aristocrats should rule the majority of commoners, but the children of aristocratic families are often ignorant young masters. Some base it on wealth, saying that a minority of wealthy people should rule the majority of poor people, but the wealthy do not necessarily have political ability. Some base it on knowledge, saying that a minority of people with higher education should rule the majority of uneducated people, but many in the intellectual class are mere bookworms. Now, may I ask what the Kuomintang's tutelage-style aristocratic politics is based on? It is not based on bloodline, nor on wealth, nor on education, but in name on party membership, and in reality subordinate to warlords. If we say that all Kuomintang members are the wise, the best in the country, the first to know and perceive, and should be the ruling class; if we say that all non-Kuomintang members are the unworthy, the last to know and perceive, and should be ruled slaves, then this "aristocratic" standard is too unreasonable. Moreover, the facts tell us that many Kuomintang members today are not outstanding in terms of personality, knowledge, or talent.</p>
<p>The above are the reasons why the Kuomintang cannot "tutor" and is not qualified to "tutor." Even assuming that the Kuomintang can "tutor" and is qualified to "tutor," political history tells us that talking about tutelage makes it impossible to talk about democracy. First, it is theoretically inconsistent. If there is a tutelage ruling class and a tutored ruled class, Wang still says that he can "cultivate civil rights" and that "the people's power is increasing day by day in time and expanding day by day in space." This is a lie. The development of civil rights must be automatic; if it is "tutored" out, it is not civil rights. Looking through the history of various countries in the world, may I ask which country's democracy was "tutored" by the rulers? May I also ask which country's democracy was not won by the people? Second, it is factually inconsistent. Any individual or group that obtains political power and occupies a ruling position is always unwilling to let go. This is a universal human trait. The political history of all countries can prove this. The tutelage theory hopes that the tutelage ruling class will train the general public to seize the political power they monopolize and transition from tutelage to constitutionalism, which is also deception. What was the Kuomintang's tutelage like in the past? The Kuomintang's tutelage will probably be the same in the future. Not to mention others, Wang and Yu are the first to seize political power and not let go. Therefore, talking about tutelage makes it impossible to talk about democracy; talking about democracy requires opposing tutelage. The two cannot be combined; Wang and Yu should choose for themselves.</p>
<p>The second reason for opposing the end of tutelage is that without the Kuomintang, there would be no Republic of China; destroying tutelage would be destroying the Kuomintang; and destroying the Kuomintang would be destroying the Republic of China. This is not only illogical but also intentionally insulting to the people of the whole country. Let's break it down and discuss whether there would be no Republic of China without the Kuomintang. The birth of the Republic of China was caused by many factors, such as the intrusion of Western culture, the oppression of foreign powers, the corruption of the Qing Dynasty, and the impact of the industrial revolution. These were the fundamental causes of the revolution. Even in terms of overthrowing the rule of the Manchus, many individuals and groups other than the Kuomintang made contributions. Now, Wang and Yu are dismissing this with a single stroke of the pen, which is either due to ignorance or intentional exaggeration. Generally speaking, a revolution in a country must have fundamental causes; as long as the fundamental conditions are ripe, the revolutionary party is just happening to be there at the right time. If the Kuomintang had not carried out the Xinhai Revolution, someone else would have. Moreover, the revolution against the Manchus was not carried out by the Kuomintang alone, and it was certainly not carried out by the current Kuomintang. The main force in overthrowing Yuan Shikai was Cai E and others, not the Kuomintang. Furthermore, the current peril of the Republic of China is largely the responsibility of the current Kuomintang members. Now that foreign enemies have invaded the country, the ruling Kuomintang leaders, such as Wang and Yu, should apologize to the people of the whole country instead of saying that without the Kuomintang, there would be no Republic of China. That is simply outrageous!</p>
<p>As for whether destroying tutelage means destroying the Kuomintang, it is not difficult to answer if we look at the party politics of democratic countries. Political parties do not necessarily need tutelage; abolishing tutelage does not mean abolishing the party that advocates tutelage. The Kuomintang was a party before tutelage, and it will still be a party even if tutelage ends now. The reason why we advocate ending tutelage is only to abolish the Kuomintang's special position of monopolizing political power. From one perspective, it is not destroying the Kuomintang but trying to preserve the Kuomintang's political life and prevent it from being overthrown by revolution.</p>
<p>As for saying that destroying the Kuomintang means destroying the Republic of China, that is even more ridiculous. The Republic of China is not a parasite of the Kuomintang; on the contrary, the Kuomintang is a parasite of the Republic of China. If the Kuomintang is eliminated, the Republic of China will not necessarily be eliminated; if the Republic of China is eliminated, the Kuomintang will inevitably be eliminated. As the saying goes, "When the skin is gone, what will the hair cling to?" Moreover, given how the Kuomintang has been acting in recent years, losing sovereignty and national humiliation externally, oppressing the people internally, putting the party above the country, and having a party but no country, even if it comes to the point where the Kuomintang's political power is abolished, it may not be a bad way to support the Republic of China.

<p>In the area south of Shanghai in this city, there are very few public parks for citizens to visit and relax during their leisure time. The Municipal Education Bureau is aware of this and has actively designed a plan. In addition to arranging the Confucius Temple into a park and preparing to open a public education center, it also plans to establish a zoo at the original site of Qinpu near Panfang in Penglai Road. It previously submitted a plan and was approved by the municipal government to allocate funds for construction. However, the site was occupied by the 28th Wireless Telegraph Station of the Ministry of Military Affairs, and it was temporarily unable to be realized. Now, the Municipal Education Bureau has sent personnel to negotiate its recovery and has jointly reorganized and constructed the site with the Public Works Bureau. In addition, some of the tigers, leopards, lions, elephants, and other rare birds and animals to be displayed in the park have already been purchased, and various others are being procured. People from all walks of life who are willing to donate various birds and animals are welcome. The Citizens' Education Center</p>

<p>The construction of the internal buildings and the arrangement of the garden landscape of the Municipal Public Education Center, which is planned to be established in the Confucius Temple in the west of this city, has been mostly completed. The model specimens and other exhibits have also been purchased and prepared in order. It was expected to be completed and opened soon. However, due to the war, the work in the center was suspended. Now that the war has come to an end and local order is gradually returning to normal, the unfinished projects and all ongoing matters have been jointly planned and actively handled by the Education and Public Works Bureaus. It is planned to open all or part of the garden landscape first to satisfy the public's desire. Physical Education</p>

<p>During the Japanese invasion of China, our people suffered greatly, and various sports competitions in Shanghai have been suspended for more than three months. Now that the Shanghai side has signed a ceasefire agreement, although the national crisis has not yet ended, we must not give up eating because of choking. This is precisely the time for us to strengthen our bodies and serve the country. The weather is gradually getting warmer, and soccer and basketball are no longer suitable. However, tennis is the only beautiful outdoor sport in the summer. The Shanghai Lawn Tennis Association has already held a meeting to prepare, and the league will begin around mid-June. It is now learned that the repair of the Chinese Tennis Association's court has been completed and play will begin immediately. The association hopes that all former members will enthusiastically register and join as in previous years to prepare for selecting a team to participate in the Western League competition to maintain the reputation of the Chinese who have dominated for several years. The association has appointed Hu Jiansheng, Hu Yunlai, Li Baojun, Ouyang Xuchu, and Ling Xitao as committee members to preside over the association's administration. The first meeting will be held tomorrow (the 13th) at 12:30 at Dun Tuomo to discuss the association's constitution and other matters.</p>

<h3 id="e157">Gold Bullion Still Shows Slight Decline <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>▲ The market was very calm. Yesterday, the gold price continued to decline, and the market conditions were very flat. The total transaction volume for the day was only a few taels. Looking back, the final price fell by more than three taels. Initially, the decline was due to the repeated rise in silver prices, while foreign exchange rates did not fluctuate excessively. However, the market atmosphere was confusing, with rumors of silver price meetings, causing people to panic. As a result, market prices hovered around 730 taels. In the afternoon, the market became even calmer, and trading was minimal. Prices fluctuated by only one tael or so. Because it was Wednesday, there was no foreign exchange market. Later, the fluctuations were within 30 taels. However, as the settlement date approached, multiple parties supported the price, hence the stability. The day's situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ The morning market fluctuated uncertainly. From the opening of the June contract in the morning, the price fell by 1.6 mace to 731.3 taels. Because the price of silver and silver dollars each rose by one-eighth, private telegrams did not change. But the expectation of a fall from the previous day had not materialized, and people seemed pessimistic. Moreover, there were many sellers, such as Yongfeng, Yuanheng, Fuchang, Yuankang, Xiangyu, and He. The price continued to fall to 28 taels. Soon, Zhifeng, Yongyu, Heyuanmao, and others re-entered the market. Moreover, Chinese banks traded with each other. June British gold was 179375, and August was 18. Therefore, at 9:30, the listed price of British gold was 30 taels and 7 mace, the same as before. The US dollar exchange rate slightly decreased, so the price decreased by 125, followed by 29 taels and 3 mace, sold by retail investors. Subsequently, Chengfeng Yong sold August US dollars to Mitsui at 125. HSBC also absorbed at 125 and advanced the transaction slip. Fuyu, Qianchangxiang, Hengyu, and others also advanced. Approaching 10 o'clock, the price was 31 taels and 7 mace. Afterwards, Yuankangxiang, Hongkangyong, Shunli Yifeng, Yongyuantai, Futaiheng, and others came to sell. Furthermore, HSBC released US$6875 for this month, causing the gold price to fall slightly by 2 taels and some. At 11:00, the price was 29 taels and 5 mace. However, within one hour, the price fluctuated by only a few mace and then rose to 30 taels and 9 mace. Suddenly, news came that the American silver conference had already been held and that Britain had also expressed support. This immediately caused panic, and more sellers appeared, yielding 2 taels. At 11:15, the price was 28 taels and 8 mace. In an instant, Zhifeng, Yongfuyu, Futaiheng, Hengchangyong, and others entered the market to buy. Furthermore, the bank absorbed US$125 to 0625 in August, and it was rumored that a certain bank opened with more than 400 bars of spot goods. This was not true, but the price had already risen by more than 1 tael. At 11:30, the price was 30 taels and 3 mace. The afternoon closing price was 29 taels and 1 mace, and it was again done to 9 mace or so. The listed price was changed to 800 taels, with a discount of about 70 taels.</p>
<p>▲ The afternoon was stagnant. The afternoon market opened at 28 taels and 8 mace. Then it was quite calm, fluctuating by only a few mace. Until 2:30, the price rose by more than 1 tael because Taifeng, Chengda, Decheng, and others bought in, reaching 30 taels and 6 mace. Afterwards, small-scale Yuanmao Yong and others sold. At 3:30, the price was 29 taels and 8 mace. Within that one hour, it fluctuated by no more than 3 or 4 mace. Because Fuchang came in, the price increased to 30 taels and 4 mace. Then it remained calm. At 4 o'clock, news suddenly came that Siam was planning to abandon the gold standard, and the price fell by another 1 tael to 29 taels and 1 mace. Afterwards, general retail investors chased after the price, returning to 8 or 9 mace. At 4:20, the price was 30 taels. However, the market remained soft at the 4:30 closing, calculated as 29 taels and 2 mace, a decrease of 3 taels and 7 mace compared to the previous day. After the market closed, the price was again done to 29 taels and 5 or 6 mace, and goods were done at 6 mace, which was 9 taels and 8 mace at the close. The highest price of the day was 31 taels and 7 mace, and the lowest price was 28 taels, a difference of 3 taels and 7 mace. The listed price had a discount of 70 taels. The book entry added 29 taels for compensation. The bare gold was added at 6 taels and 7.5 mace. Because cash was exhausted, the price was raised.</p>
<p>▲ The transaction volume was minimal. According to the statistics of transactions on the table, Zhifeng Yong, Chengfeng Yong, Fuyu, Qianchangxiang, Chengda Yong, and others all entered smoothly. Yuanheng, Hongkangyong, Yuankangxiang, Yuhe, Yongfeng, Yuanmao Yong, Yuantai, Futaiheng, and Yifengyong all exited. Hengyu, Wanxing, Dadecheng, Yuandayong, and others had varying entries and exits. In the afternoon, each firm had only sporadic deposits and withdrawals.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Foreign Exchange Rates Without Major Fluctuations <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>

The trading volume in half a day was about 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. When the gold firms Chengfeng Yong and others sold, they covered their positions, and the arbitrage price was not much different from the previous day, about 35 taels. People were calm.

<h3 id="e160">The Situation of Silver Dollar Trade Yesterday's News <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>▲ Strong inflows and outflows... Prices are difficult to raise. ▲</p>
<p>▲General Market Conditions: Yesterday, the exchange rate of silver dollars was weak in the morning and strong in the afternoon, resulting in a very slight difference. As for the trading situation, silver and money dealers had a good appetite, but it was almost impossible to raise their prices. Because the financial community is still in the period before the total closing of accounts last year, there is naturally no ability to develop. Therefore, although goods are crowded and trade is booming, the control of silver dollar funds has not yet been relaxed. It is impossible to seek to drive the situation into the right track.</p>
<p>▲Premiums and Discounts (Silver Dollar Premium): Yesterday morning, trading was strong, but the sellers prevailed over the buyers, so the price was slightly soft, at 7 qian 03 li 2 hao 5, slightly lower by 2 hao 5 compared to the previous afternoon. The afternoon market trend was slightly better, and the price rose sharply by half a li, to 7 qian 03 li 7 hao 5, which was only 2 hao 5 better than the afternoon market of the previous day. (Silver Discount) Because the inflow and outflow of Chinese merchant trade funds were particularly strong, the demand for silver seemed more urgent than the previous day. Therefore, the silver discount was also firmer by 2 fen, calculated as 8 fen, the same in the morning and afternoon. The discount including surcharge was still only 6 or 7 fen.</p>
<p>▲Subsidiary Coin Market Conditions: The price of small silver dollars in Jiangnan was exactly the same as the afternoon market of the previous day, still at 6 qian 1 fen 2 li. There were no changes in the morning and afternoon markets. The trading volume was 3,500 jiao in the morning market and 4,000 jiao in the afternoon market. The morning market price of small silver dollars in Guangdong was 6 qian 01 li 2 hao 5, slightly lower by 25 compared to the previous afternoon, while the afternoon market remained the same, at 6 qian 01 li 5 hao. The trading volume was 85,000 jiao in the morning market and 35,000 jiao in the afternoon market. The copper coin price also did not fluctuate, remaining at 419,000 wen.</p>
<p>▲Silver Dollar Inflows and Outflows (Silver Funds): The trading volume of drafts in the market was still about 3 million. Bank collections and settlements were average for foreign firms, calculated as 1.7 to 1.8 million for draft collections and settlements, 2.9 million for cargo remittance mortgages, etc., over 500,000 for telegraphic transfers, over 800,000 for special funds, 600,000 for warehouse withdrawals, mostly for Chinese firms, calculated as 4.4 to 4.5 million for draft collections and settlements, 3.6 to 3.7 million for remittance mortgages, etc., 600,000 to 700,000 for customs duties, 800,000 for foreign funds, over 800,000 for telegraphic transfers, 400,000 for warehouse entries, 3.1 million for money shop silver guild settlements, 380,000 to 390,000 for silver surcharge funds, over 800,000 for remittances from various sources, 400,000 to 500,000 for cash settlements. (Foreign Funds): The trading volume of remittance drafts in the morning market was 840,000, and 590,000 in the afternoon market. The volume of banknotes inside and outside the exchange was 120,000 in the morning market and 50,000 in the afternoon market. The volume of deposit slips was 10,000 in the morning market and 65,000 in the afternoon market. Bank transactions totaled 1.2 million in both markets. Foreign firms' transactions totaled 1.34 million. Money shops and foreign guild settlements totaled 6.1 million. Foreign surcharge funds totaled 1.6 million. Foreign loan settlements totaled over 800,000. Mortgage redemptions totaled over 100,000. The source of funds from other sources is unknown. Silk cocoon shipment totaled over 300,000.

<h3 id="e161">The Difficulties in Developing Foreign Funds <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>During March and April of this year, after the 19th Route Army retreated from Shanghai, the current silver dollars in various ports along the Yangtze River and inland were successively transferred to Shanghai. Almost all the essence of the five southern provinces was concentrated in Shanghai. However, the sudden acquisition of a large amount of cash by silver and money dealers, coupled with the unrest in the current situation, has made it impossible for the funds to flow smoothly. This situation of continuous inflow without outflow, with daily buying and selling within the market, cannot inject huge amounts of funds into society. As far as recent observations are concerned, the arrival of funds from other sources in Shanghai has not stopped. It can be expected that if no efforts are made to develop smooth flow, the premium price trend will eventually decline. However, at present, cocoons are generally on the market. Due to poor harvests, there are fears that there will be a large demand. Therefore, the hope of resolving the difficult situation for the time being is slim. Certificates</p>
<h3 id="e162">Bond Prices Fall Slightly, Market Conditions Are Sparse <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday (11th), the market conditions of each bond market in the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange were as follows: the futures market was very sparse, and the buying and selling atmosphere was unusually calm. It is estimated that more than 1 million was opened in the morning market, and only 550,000 yuan in the afternoon market, totaling 1.6 million yuan. Among them, such as the 20 customs, volumes, unified salt tax, and redeployment, only more than 200,000 yuan, and the others were less than 100,000 yuan. The spot transactions totaled 90,000 yuan, with 19th Guan Yi Shan accounting for 17,000 yuan, and the rest being around 10,000 yuan. Only the demobilization and financial sectors were 1,000 yuan each. As for the changes in the price of each bond, although there are no new changes in the current situation and diplomatic situation, the environment is as calm as before. It is particularly because the buying is cold, and although the sellers only sell sporadically, the market still has oversupply, so the prices have mostly fallen back. However, the trend is very peaceful, with almost no changes between each market. As a result, except for the spot and several spot goods for demobilization that rose slightly, the others were mostly small corners, ranging from six to seven corners. The bond market situation has entered a depressed path.

<h3 id="e163">There Are Bulls Closing Out in the Yarn Market <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market is still continuing to advance, and the situation is still good. Although the actual demand is less than the previous day, the amount entered by each gang is still considered good. The manufacturers' mentality is firmer. Because more than 20,000 bales of cotton yarn have been sold in the past two days, the hoarding situation is much easier than before. Because of this, people's hearts are moving toward tightening. According to one part, it seems that a large amount of spot sales will be launched in the future, and it will be difficult to rise or fall temporarily. However, the commercial situation in all directions is still in a state of distress, so all parties are deeply afraid of no active purchasing power. Therefore, the market situation in the afternoon showed a slight soft state again. What the future will be depends on customer sales.</p>
<p>▲The human standard returned to looseness in the afternoon. The human standard opened in the morning with the remaining momentum of the previous day, and the situation was still strong. Moreover, retail investors patched up, and the second market rose again. The second or three markets fell slightly, and the result was a rise of one or two cents. The market atmosphere was looser in the afternoon. It was heard that the procurement of each gang was relatively rare, and the bulls took the opportunity to close out. Therefore, each month fell back by four, five, and seven cents. The total turnover for the day was 8,550 bales. According to the sale, Chongyu sold 250 bales, Mingde 250 bales, Gengfeng 450 bales, Jifeng 250 bales, Ruidai 150 bales, Xiesheng 250 bales, Yichang 550 bales, Yiyu 350 bales, Hengde 150 bales, and Zhenda 150 bales. The purchase was Gengfeng 200 bales, Rui 450 bales, Taichang 550 bales, Yuantai 250 bales, Minghua 200 bales, Dafeng 200 bales, Yukang 350 bales, and Dafu 100 bales. The closing prices are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Human standard closing price is lower than the previous day's deposit. September 1544 fell 618.300. July period 1543 fell 713.400. October 1547221.000. August period 1545619.050. Total 71.800</p>
<p>▲4,500 bales of spot sales. The spot yarn sales are still good, but less than yesterday. According to the statistics of each gang's purchases for the whole day, 4,500 bales were sold. The market price rose by two and a half cents to five cents. Customer gangs: Yunnan entered 460 bales, Guangdong 700 bales, Jiangxi 125 bales, Tianjin 110 bales, Shantou 1,000 bales, North Gang 185 bales, Inland 355 bales, Wenzhou 80 bales, Fujian 55 bales, Changsha 510 bales, Sichuan 175 bales, and miscellaneous gangs 80 bales. It is heard that China Trade Corporation opened 4,000 bales to Shenxin Dasheng No. 2 Factory, and the price was not announced.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Cotton Market Is Mediocre <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market showed a slight weakness. Due to the mediocrity of the overseas cotton market, people's hearts were depressed. However, although the storage of foreign cotton in Shanghai stacks was strong, the local cotton was relatively reduced. Therefore, most retail investors tended to be bullish. As for the actual demand, it has been more active recently, but the selling price is not high. Some holders have to relax and sell due to the year-end closing in late May.</p>
<p>▲Zheng Standard Has No Spirit: The market situation was extremely flat when Zheng Standard opened in the morning. There was no sign of revitalization, and each month fell by five points. In the afternoon, it followed the yarn market downward, and the situation was still soft, each falling by one cent. The total turnover for the day was 8,500 dans. According to the sale, Shenchang sold 700 dans, Zhenda 500 dans, Yuanda 500 dans, Changfeng 900 dans, Hengde 200 dans, and Hengyi 300 dans. The purchase was Jifeng 200 dans, Dafeng 800 dans, Tianlong 200 dans, Yifeng 200 dans, and Changhe 1,600 dans. The closing prices of Zheng Standard are listed below. Zheng Standard Closing Price Compared to the Previous Day's Deposit Number of Accounts: July Period 32.60 Fall 15 34,500, August Period 32.75 10 49,100, October Period 32.70 10 53,100, Total 135,700.</p>
<p>▲Factory Demand Is Slightly Available: Each factory has a good appetite for spot cotton, but the offer price is very low. However, the holders are particularly unwilling to compromise, and the two parties have not been able to reach an agreement. Only Tongyi Chongxin Factory entered 300 bales. The price of Dongtai Flower was 31 taels 2 qian and a half.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Foreign Cotton Is Exhaustingly Weak <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton was initially weak due to the sale by foreign firms, then firm due to the purchase by counterparts, and finally soft again due to the closing out of some bulls. It is estimated that the futures fell by 1 to 3 pound tones, and the spot price did not move. British cotton futures fell by 3 or 4 points, and spot fell by 8 points. Egyptian cotton spot fell by 20 points. Indian cotton was closed. The original telegram is recorded on the left.

<p>Yesterday, in the foreign merchant tea market in this port, the Zhenmei green tea produced by local tea factories, and the British firms Xiehe, Yihuo, Jinlong, etc., all had an appetite for entry. The market situation was not deserted. The city talked about more than 150 boxes, and the selling price was 1245 taels, with little change from before. As for the Jinlong foreign firm purchasing more than 100 boxes of Lu Zhuang Suian · Zhenmei the day before yesterday, it was heard yesterday that it had been formally recorded, with a price of 170 taels to 175 taels. According to the observation of general tea merchants, it is feared that the market situation will be difficult to stand firm when large gangs from all over arrive in Shanghai in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e167">She County Green Tea Has Been Weighed <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Since the beginning of summer, She County green tea has been completely picked by the famous mountain households. The foreign firm store has opened the weighing, and the opening price for Nanlu goods is 95 yuan, and the opening price for Xilu goods is from 68 yuan to 76 yuan. Later, due to the rush of shop customers from various shops, the market price soared by six or seven yuan. In addition, due to excessive frost and dew last winter, the output of each mountain head was reduced, and there is a tendency for the market price to continue to rise.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Xing'an Tea Production Declines <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>The tea production in Xing'an, Ganzhou, has always been rich, especially the production of famous mountains is the most superior. In previous years, the Honglu tea brands of the Yangzhuang River Port and the Hanzhou shop used to send people here to purchase. After the decline of the River Port tea market, the route of Xing tea has become narrower, only holding a small number of sales fields in the shop, and the market price has also decreased day by day. The mountain households believe that tea cannot be relied upon, so they do not add cultivation, and the output is also decreasing year by year. In the past two years, Ge Yuan, where tea is produced, has been occupied by red bandits, and there is no production. Although the Communist bandits in the area have been wiped out by the national army this year, it is still difficult to eradicate the remaining shares. At the moment, farmers are giving priority to their urgent plans, and they are mostly busy with rice farming, and do not pay much attention to tea. There is still no tea market to speak of.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Fuliang Green Tea Is Being Picked <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Fuliang tea is divided into red and green. The green tea in the Cangjiawan Shijing area bordering Wubei is quite good in terms of water leaf quality and taste. This year, because the foreign Hongzhuang tea brands in Fuliang have been greatly reduced compared to the old days, and other places are far away and inconvenient for transportation, the Qing tea is still produced as usual. Recently, the sky suddenly cleared and rained suddenly, and the tea buds are developing faster and faster. The mountain households think that the amount of tea needed by the tea houses in Xiutun will inevitably increase, so they pick the tender heads early in order to increase the selling price. Since the day before yesterday (2nd), they have been picking them one after another. However, the tea trees in the fields that are exposed to the wind have not developed very well due to the freezing of the cold snow last winter. The output is not expected to be a good harvest.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Jinhua Spring Cocoons Have Already Seen New <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>▲Insufficient silk spitting due to cold weather… The cocoon body is not good ▲</p>
<p>▲The cocoon market has not yet opened.▲</p>
<p>The silkworm flood season in Jinhua Prefecture is earlier than in Hangzhou and Shaoxing. This year, due to the severe weather, the native species cultivated by farmers were completely discarded. Only the foreign species of silkworms still have a surplus. However, after they went on the cluster, the climate was cold and the silkworms did not spit enough silk. The new cocoons have now been off the cluster, but the cocoon body is not good. The cocoon market has not yet been leased out, and has not yet been opened. There is no market for new cocoons. Farmers are generally prepared to bake them themselves using native stoves.</p>
<h3 id="e171">European and American Silk Sales Are Still Difficult to Activate <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the European and American sales stomach in the foreign silk market in this port was still difficult to activate. The price of Niss Silk in the overseas market is still trying to enter with cheap prices, and various silk weavers still think that the price of white factory warp is still high and the telegram is silent, and the market is stagnant. European and American silk sales are still difficult to turn around for a while. Food</p>
<h3 id="e172">The Rice Market Situation Turns Hard <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>▲Hun South Yesterday: Hun South rice market, the source of each gang was more than 20, and the Pu storage was scarce. Due to the active sales market in the past few days, the buyers took advantage of this to add to the inventory. The Su Tong gang added nearly a corner, and the thin rice was scarce. The transaction was very active, and the corner was also increased. The general trend is determined by the flexible yin transformation that is sold as soon as it arrives. The Changxi Beigeng had no honor or disgrace, and presented a downstream phenomenon. The amount of Podjiang Huujiao for the whole day was about 3,000 dans.</p>
<p>▲Hun North Yesterday: The source of each gang was 16 or 17, and the transactions in this street were not very active. A telegram came from Xilu that the market for thick and rough rice was upward, but this port was also affected. Green corner thin rice and Songjiang rice each offered a corner. Changxi Beigeng and Jiangyin rice customer gangs purchased and cleared out the meager accumulation of goods. The price also hardened by one or two corners. The shade element was generally sold. There was no rise or fall in the market.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Foreign Rice Is Flat And Soft <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice was slightly weak. The market atmosphere was particularly bad in the morning. Very few short-term futures were returned, and many new households entered. Only 300 tons were traded, and the price was 5 taels and 5.5 cents, which was 2.5 cents lower than the previous day. In the afternoon, some mainland gangs bought spot goods, and the futures market recovered slightly by half a cent. The spot market also turned to a stand. However, there were no sales from the Yangtze River and Jiangbei areas. This street was only slightly responsive, and the market was still difficult to turn around quickly. The total market opened with 3,000 bags of Xiaojiao, priced at 10 yuan, 5.5 jiao to 4.5 jiao, 2,400 bags of Min Dang, priced at 10 yuan, 8.5 jiao to 7.2 jiao, 2,500 bags of Xiaojiao coarse rice, priced at 9 yuan and 4.7 jiao, and old ones at 9 yuan and 3.7 jiao.</p>

<p>▲A Glimpse of the Current Market▲</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market remained weak, and the market was quite chaotic. Because of the free buying and selling in the market today, there is no precedent for opening and closing prices or the second, third, fourth, and fifth markets. The exchange does not take responsibility at all, and only sends some staff to act as receptionists. Therefore, there is no limit to shouting prices, and there is no limit to transactions. All customers, brokers, factory households, firms, and non-professionals can enter the seat to buy and sell. Yesterday, because the old car brand needed to be better than the battleship, the price was also more expensive. There was no question about miscellaneous brands. The first opening price for warships in May was 2 taels and 1.75 cents, and the closing price was 2 taels and 2.25 cents. The opening price for old car powder was 2 taels and 2.5 cents, and the closing price was 2 taels and 2.75 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Goods From North And South Are High In Orchid And Bamboo Branches, And There Is A Shortage Of High Quality Goods <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Recently, some orchid and bamboo branches have been transported to the market. The cost is about 50 taels. However, it is very rare in all directions now, and there is hope for a bumper harvest in various producing areas this year. Therefore, the market price has repeatedly turned down and is extremely weak. Yesterday, the general market price for ordinary brands was 33-34 taels. The price of selected brands was determined according to the goods. However, high-quality goods were very scarce, and the lower grades were more numerous.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Sugar Market Association's trading floor saw brisk activity. No. 24 Dutch raw white sugar traded at 13 taels, 4 mace, and 5 candareens; high-quality coarse-grain sugar at 13 taels, 6 mace; Hong Kong goods at 13 taels, 4 mace; and Shantou goods at 13 taels, 3 mace. Transactions were quite smooth, and the market appeared lively. No. 20 medium-grade white sugar traded at 13 taels, and No. 10 Dutch red sugar at 9 taels, 7 mace, with fewer transactions. Finely ground white sugar traded at 13 taels, 5 mace, and was in short supply at the point of sale. Taikoo Sugar's CW mark sold for 15 taels, 9 mace to 16 taels; DY mark for 15 taels, 4 mace and 5 candareens to 5 mace; and HM mark for 13 taels, 9 mace. The future market rose by 9 mace and 5 candareens, showing a steady trend. Both the market board and the factory were calling for price increases, with No. 1 sugar quoted at 15 taels, 4 mace. However, due to slow sales, there were few takers. Zhenxin offered goods for delivery in one week, shipped from Tianjin to Shanghai. Taikoo B mark granulated sugar, 300 bags, was offered at 16 taels, 2 mace, and sold very well. End of piece goods report.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Shanghai Small Cloth Dealers Actively Procure Western Bleached Cloth <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Piece goods trading showed signs of progress. Yesterday, local and Shanghai small cloth dealers were quite active. Sales of Western bleached cloth were particularly brisk, but prices were difficult to raise due to abundant inventories. Yesterday, Gongping's Red Little Deer brand sold for 12 taels, 7 mace, and 5 candareens; Taihe's Golden Nine Horses for 12 taels, 5 mace; Blue Big Deer for 10 taels and 7 candareens and 5 candareens; Gongping's Golden Five Leopards for 10 taels and 5 candareens; Baoshun's Man and Lion for 10 taels and 2 candareens and 5 candareens; Xinghua Village for 10 taels and 5 candareens; Double Elephant Head for 10 taels; Gongping's Western-Style Beauty for 10 taels and 2 candareens and 5 candareens; and Baoshun's Big Hero for 10 taels and 2 candareens and 5 candareens. Over sixty pieces were transacted. Tianjin dealers slightly increased their purchases of glass yarn and Argand cloth, with prices averaging 3 mace, 7 or 8 candareens. Lun Chang's printed cloth saw fifty-plus pieces sold to Qingdao dealers, with prices ranging from 4 taels, 4 mace to 4 taels, 4 mace and 5 candareens. Chengdu and Wanxian dealers actively purchased black-ground satin, priced at 2 mace and 2 candareens. Among locally produced cotton cloth, Jin San Ta bleached cloth remained the strongest, and No. 9 cloth also showed a continued upward trend. Others mostly declined. Fine cloth and fine twill were even weaker. No. 16 cloth saw renewed interest from northern dealers, likely due to its substantial price drop. Yesterday, Samsung, Double Fish Jiqing, and Hongfu brands were among those being traded. Hardware</p>
<h3 id="e178">The Decline in Pure Antimony Has Been Halted <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Since foreign firms stopped dealing in pure antimony, the market slumped. The lowest price for standard-grade antimony was only 200 taels per ton (the lowest in nearly fifteen years). There were rumors of large orders being placed, with prices potentially even lower, causing concern among those involved in this trade. In recent days, the market has stabilized. This is because the supply from Hunan has dried up, and local firms with strength have worked hard to maintain prices, so the price of standard-grade antimony has stabilized after the decline. It is said that asking prices in the market have risen to 210 taels. Miscellaneous News</p>

<p>▲ Report from American Eastern Silver Company ▲ Grain, cotton, and stock markets are all firm and steady. Trading on the New York stock market has not been strong recently, but with firmer buying interest, prices have slightly improved. This is because general merchants have increasing confidence in the government's ability to maintain its budget. Although United States Steel Corporation recently announced a new record low in operating tonnage, the public remained calm, and the company's stock price only fell by one-eighth of a pound. Currently, most people are taking a wait-and-see approach, and there are few short-term traders, so the market is not active. At the close of trading on Tuesday this week, a total of 700,000 shares were traded. Wheat prices remained firm, and the cotton and stock markets were both stable. All parties are awaiting better news. Despite some unsatisfactory reports, public sentiment remains unshaken. ▲ Attached is the Dow Jones Daily Index May 9 May 10 Change 30 Industrials 57.04 57.68 Up 0.64 20 Railroads 20.92 20.90 Down 0.02 20 Utilities 24.54 24.62 Up 0.08</p>

<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>We oppose dictatorship, and we also do not acknowledge double leadership! These are the two most incisive sentences that Mr. Sun Zhesheng said on behalf of our people. Looking around the country, it is fragmented, the landscape has changed color, and it has been reduced to a broken-down situation with a myriad of problems, which everyone unanimously says is the result of five years of dictatorial politics. But in all fairness, the blame cannot be placed on one person alone. The entire responsibility for failing the people should be attributed to the entire Kuomintang! When the dictatorship falls, double leadership is produced. In the current situation, being obsequious to foreigners and ruining the country means that double leadership is not necessarily better than dictatorship. In short, they are all selfish and self-interested ambitious people who are not worthy of being leaders of political construction. As for how to move from rule by people to rule by law? How to move from military rule to civil rule? It all depends on the continued struggle of the people.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Returning from Southeast Asia <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Zou Mengchan</p>
<p>My cousin, Ms. Chen Yiyu, and Ms. Wu Ruiying, the wife of national language expert Guo Houjue, have been teaching at the Ipoh Girls' School in Perak, Southeast Asia for many years. This time, hearing that the national crisis is pressing and angered by the Japanese army's brutality and the bitter fighting of our 19th Route Army, they care about their homeland and, motivated by righteous indignation, they wished to participate in the rear-area nursing work. So they resolutely resigned from their teaching positions and came to Shanghai together. Recently, the field hospital has ended its service, and it is a pity that they did not get to participate. Although their wishes were not fulfilled, their sincerity is commendable. Yesterday, I received an invitation by telephone and was able to chat with them for several days. What they described about the local customs and scenery in Southeast Asia can provide material for discussion. So I recorded a few things as follows. The enthusiasm of the overseas Chinese for patriotism Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia seem to have no national protection and are subject to unequal treaties. Their position is different from that of the expatriates of powerful countries. Therefore, they all hope that the nation will prosper and be protected. Hearing that the former 19th Route Army fought bloody battles against the Japanese and repeatedly performed meritorious deeds, they were all delighted and actively contributed. Although the Perak port donated the least, the amount still reached 40,000. From this, we can see a glimpse of the enthusiasm of the overseas Chinese for patriotism. The importance of the national language Most of the overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia are from southern China. In addition to the dialects of various places, there is no standard language. Therefore, the education sector especially promotes the national language. Now, even elementary school students who are eight or nine years old can speak very pure national language. As for school teachers, their proficiency in the national language is particularly important for their advancement. Simplicity of life Southeast Asia is located in the tropics, so the climate is like early summer in China all year round. Within a day, the morning is like spring, and the temperature at noon is usually between 77 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. The highest record is only 96 degrees. Therefore, men's and women's clothing is also simplified accordingly. Women wear white shirts and blue skirts, and men have only one or two sets of summer suits, which are enough for the whole year. Southeast Asia produces abundant rice, and vegetables, fish, and meat are especially cheap. Life is simple, so it is very easy to make a living.</p>

<p>When the Shanghai Incident first broke out, the enemy army used Park as its headquarters. One day, our army sent forty men divided into ten teams to attack. First, four men tested the waters, and the rest were scattered to the left and right. The Japanese chieftain saw four men intruding into the park gate from afar and laughed loudly, ordering them to be captured alive to carry out his brutal torture. So they went out in all directions to encircle and pursue them. Our army quickly retreated like flying, unable to be caught. When they returned, all the cannons in the park were firing in unison, and the enemy flags had been removed and replaced with our national emblem. They were greatly shocked and fled in all directions. At that time, our main force had already covered the area, and none of them escaped. In this battle, we captured their entire force.</p>
<p>A certain soldier, Mr. So-and-so, had his femur bone hit by a bullet and needed surgery. The doctor said that anesthesia should be used. Mr. So-and-so refused, saying, "I am not afraid of risking my life, let alone a small cut." He calmly underwent the surgery without any fear. Soon, fresh blood gushed out, and he gritted his teeth and shouted, "Kill all the remnants of the Japanese army." Before he finished speaking, the bullet suddenly jumped out from the bone. Mr. So-and-so's wife heard this and praised his loyalty and courage, rushing to comfort him and covering him with a silk quilt. Everyone who heard about it was moved.</p>
<p>Our army's Cantonese pilots have many divine skills. The enemy fears them like tigers. One day, during an engagement, the enemy dropped bombs from a large aircraft. Our aircraft saw it and pursued it, climbing above it and pressing down hard. The enemy aircraft could not escape and was forced to land on the ground and captured.</p>
<p>One day, an enemy aircraft dropped a bomb. As soon as it was released, our army's aircraft shot it down. It happened to collide with the bomb, and the aircraft was destroyed. It was as if heaven was intervening, not human power.</p>

<p>— Mei Ying</p>
<p>Recently, the Central and Star cinemas in Shanghai are screening a good domestic sound film called "Old Peking." This title caught my eye and couldn't help but evoke emotions. Peking, referred to as "Old Peking," is of course different from the Peking of today. However, the Peking of today, the place where dragons coiled and tigers crouched, has, since the Shanghai Incident suddenly occurred and the national capital was moved to Luoyang, also ceased to be the Peking of today. Recently, the Sino-Japanese agreement has been signed, and the government officials can return in peace and leisurely recount their intimate feelings in the Qin Huai district and maintain the solemnity of the capital in the stone city. Otherwise, if the Japanese army continues to press on relentlessly, in order to resist for the long term, we will inevitably have to continue to move west from Luoyang's temporary capital, to Xi'an's secondary capital and eventually to the peaks of the Himalayas. If this unfortunately happens, then the so-called Peking of today will inevitably also be named Old Peking. Alas.</p>

<p>— Owner of the Hall of Seeking Happiness</p>
<p>Chapter Six: Pitifully Sharing Dreams at Night, Forced into a Secret Alliance Under the Bed; Still Remembering the First Love, Breaking the Window Date. Li Wenxia kept urging him, but he only put it off, saying that it wouldn't be too late to proceed after graduation. However, he had secretly helped her economically. They had let things drift by until waiting to be published. Now, with such a big change, Liang Xiaoyun slowly listened to this confession. She wasn't surprised, nor was she angry. Instead, she calmly asked, "I understand. Now I just want to ask you one simple question. Now that we've had this night together, you only have one path to choose. Do you want Li Wenxia, or do you want me? Tell me what's in your heart." An Yutian didn't hesitate. He buried his head deeper into Liang Xiaoyun's chest, like a child throwing a tantrum, stuttering, "I absolutely need you. You can't make me leave, no matter what severe punishment I have to endure." Liang Xiaoyun gently pushed him away, laughing coldly, "Don't pretend. I still have something serious to say to you. What I've forgiven before, I won't let go of even a little bit in the future. If you really want me, then don't even think about being ambiguous. Don't even think about making it a win-win situation. Think about it. Can Li Wenxia marry me and be subordinate to me? I might be able to suffer a little, but given the fact that we're working together, I can't just let go and do things if I don't have enough status. It's still useless to you. There's no way. I have to apologize to Li Wenxia twelve times over. Please, cancel that verbal engagement definitively. It's just an empty promise. I expect that cancelling it won't be very difficult. If you can be frank and explain the benefits and drawbacks to her, and if she truly loves you, she might still forgive your predicament. I really hope she can see things clearly, and I even want to make her a friend. I'll send her a sum of money for living expenses. Can you write a letter to her in my presence according to what I said?" An Yutian frowned and answered, "I'll just have to do as you say. Are you going to write that letter now?" Liang Xiaoyun smiled, "You can write it tomorrow morning. But don't frown and look forced, lest you regret it later. You should turn me down right now if you can't do it." An Yutian quickly reached out to cover her cherry lips and said, "Okay. Don't say it. If you still don't believe me, I can get out of bed and swear to heaven." Liang Xiaoyun held him down gently and said, "It's not that I don't believe you. It's just that I still have an even harder problem that I haven't finished talking about. You're already frowning, how can I feel at ease? But I definitely don't want you to swear. I only require that you write the letter tomorrow morning and then go to your apartment together. Immediately move all your luggage to my place. Just leave the letter to the doorman to give to Li Wenxia. From then on, we'll be living together. All actions can no longer be hidden from me. That's a stronger guarantee than anything else. It's not that I'm too petty. It's just that to leash this wild horse of yours, I have to do this. Are you in or not? You have to give me a clear answer."</p>

<h3 id="e185">Difficult to Have, Difficult to Lack <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>Since the January 28th Incident, land transportation between Shanghai and Suzhou has been completely cut off, and only water transportation remains. Therefore, in the past two months, there have been more than 30 major cases of ship robbery, which is truly appalling. Among the 30-odd robbery cases, the most noteworthy should be the previous robbery of the Sun and Yang families in Wuxi, involving about 500,000 to 600,000 yuan, and the recent major losses suffered by a wealthy man from Suzhou who was moving back to Suzhou, amounting to about 400,000 yuan. In addition, smaller losses are naturally countless. This is originally a lucky occurrence for the bandits and a gift from the Japanese cavalry. What else can be said? However, in the face of merciless artillery fire, constant tremors, and iron birds dropping bombs all over the sky, it is truly a hardship for ordinary people. If they don't flee, they will either be buried in the flames or suffer the tragic consequences of rape and plunder. They have no choice but to flee. But for those who flee, there are two kinds of people who are very miserable. If they go to the concession to rent a house, they have no money. If they stay in a hotel, they have even less money. There is no way out, they can only carry their bedding and bring their broken, essential items to several refugee shelters, where they are given a few bowls of thin porridge and a few dried radish strips, which are the most vitamin C-rich health foods. Dozens of families are crammed into a large room, for them to enjoy. The air in this room is naturally extremely tense. Some are sick, some are dazed, some cannot walk, some are crying, some are laughing, and some are in a state of despair. Such a chaotic clamor and state of confusion is naturally impossible to organize under special circumstances. In addition, there are several young Boy Scouts guarding the door for you. From the outside, it looks like a grand scale. This is the suffering of those who have no money. Do they call for a few large boats? No, they are afraid of danger on the road. Do they take a steamer? No, they are afraid that a few "bandit brothers" will come to ask for a consultation. But there is no other way. However, steamers seem to be safer than civilian boats. Even those who are usually unwilling to compromise have no choice but to send their family's life and property, more or less, onto the steamer as much as possible. Unexpectedly, there is a gunshot. That's bad! By then it will be too late. If they had known this would happen, why did they act as they did in the first place? Fortunately, the danger on the steamer passed safely, but robbery cases in the concession also occur from time to time. If, in the evening, five or six friends suddenly come in through the back door, wielding pistols and warning them not to make a sound, then they have no choice but to obey and cannot resist. This is the suffering of those who have money. Money is omnipotent, which is the most fashionable and effective slogan in modern times. But now that the country is in such a state, and society is in such a state, I can only advise a few wealthy gentlemen not to be so calculating and only focus on profits. (It is convenient to be convenient.) To be honest, living in a chaotic society, the more wealth you have, the more worries you have. Naturally, you cannot live without wealth, but if you have too much wealth, it is the burden of wealth, not the blessing of wealth. Recently, such huge robbery cases have occurred repeatedly on the Suzhou-Shanghai road, and I feel even more that hoarding wealth invites robbery and that ivory tusks invite destruction. The power of money is not omnipotent, but truly evil. The cleverest ones are naturally those old gentlemen. They immediately send the money that they usually desperately squeeze from the common people to foreign banks. Seeing that the situation is not right, they use an excuse of inspection, travel, or study, and slip away to become expatriates in foreign countries. This is such an easy and perceptive thing. Alas!</p>

<h3 id="e186">Artificial Silk <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Qu Yin</p>
<p>China has always been the world's supplier of silk fabrics. Recently, because China is unwilling to improve its silk and tea, it is on the verge of a sharp decline. At the same time, the import of foreign artificial silk is increasing day by day. Most of the silk stockings, silk shirts, silk scarves, and other popular items on the market are artificial silk fabrics. I am afraid that many Chinese people do not know what artificial silk is. I will introduce its source here. Natural silk is a protein. It has an odor when burned and leaves carbon residue. Artificial silk is made from cellulose made from wood. It has a flame when burned and no odor, and it does not leave carbon residue. It has a greater luster than natural silk, but it is not as strong or durable. There are four manufacturing methods:</p>
<p>(1) Slowly mix 400 parts of crude nitric acid with a specific gravity of 1.42 and 1000 parts of concentrated sulfuric acid with a specific gravity of 1.833. When cooled to 20 degrees Celsius, add 55 parts of bleached cellulose or cotton that has already been made. Soak it for 24 hours between 15 and 20 degrees, take it out, drain it, wash it with clean water, and dry it in a 25-degree atmosphere to form nitrated cellulose. Then dissolve the nitrated cellulose in a mixture of 40 parts of anhydrous alcohol and 60 parts of ether-removed ether (if it does not dissolve, it is because it has been soaked in nitric sulfuric acid for too long, or the nitric sulfuric acid is too concentrated, and it has become trinitrocellulose. Cotton gunpowder is because the nitric sulfuric acid is too dilute, and the soaking time is too short, and it only becomes mononitrocellulose). Place this solution in a can with countless small needle-tip holes. Apply pressure from above, and the cellulose solution will become thread-like and ejected from below. At the same time, allow the solvent contained within to evaporate on its own in a flowing high-temperature air, or directly inject it into water so that the alcohol is absorbed into water. The cellulose then becomes silk, but this silk still contains two nitro groups NO2. If they are not removed, it is most likely to catch fire or burn. It must then be reduced with an acidic sodium sulfide solution NaSH or an acidic ammonium sulfide solution NH4SH to remove the two NO2, so there is no risk of silk stockings exploding on the dance floor.</p>
<p>(2) Add alkali to a copper sulfate CuSO4 solution in Schweizer's Solution to produce copper dihydroxide Cu(OH)2. Temporarily dissolve this in concentrated ammonia solution to form a blue liquid of Cu(NH3)4(OH)2. This liquid can dissolve cellulose. Use this liquid containing cellulose, and like the method above, press it through small holes into dilute sulfuric acid. The cellulose is restored to silk.</p>
<p>(3) Dissolve cellulose in a mixture of carbon disulfide CS2 and caustic soda. Pass this dissolved cellulose solution through the same chemical process as in the second method. The chemical formula of the transformation is as follows: (C6H10O5)X + XCS2 + XNaOH = (C6H9O5CS2Na)X + XH2O</p>
<p>(4) Mix Essigsaureanhydrid (CH3CO)2O with a small amount of sulfuric acid, soak cellulose in it for ten hours, take it out, and dissolve it in chloroform. Then, like the first method, press it into water to form the final product. This is the most recently invented method, and the product produced is the best of all artificial silks.</p>

<p>As soon as the class bell rang, it was followed by a burst of loud footsteps and movements, like birds rejoicing after being confined in a cage for a long time, filling S School. So, those romantic students, generally known as dandies, heard the class bell and called it a frantic cry of liberation and a life-saving bell.</p>
<p>"Tomorrow is the fifth of September. It's a holiday prescribed by the Ministry of Education. It probably won't be an exception this year, right? Look, the peace agreement has already been signed, and Shanghai is still a prosperous Shanghai. We should go out and have some fun! Ha! Moon, are you going tonight?" The one who said these words was C, nicknamed "Wealthy Son." At this time, he had already sat lively on a long rectangular table.</p>
<p>"That's right!" E said. "It's so boring!" E was already feeling bored due to the weariness of class. Hearing this proposal, the party members of the same faction would never object, so it quickly passed by a show of hands.</p>
<p>"Why hasn't the holiday notice been posted on the announcement board yet?" E asked hesitantly. C said, "Go ask the general affairs office."</p>
<p>"This year, the studies sacrificed for the Shanghai war, even if we try desperately to make up for them, are still not enough. No more holidays at all in the future."</p>
<p>They were twenty minutes disappointed when they heard this. They deeply hated that Shanghai had to fight a war, so that they couldn't even have holidays. But a new consciousness immediately took over. They instinctively felt that they had already had enough fun during the war. So, they silently went to the classroom to attend the last class of the day.</p>
<p>"Wealthy Son" was finally unable to contain his boredom and said angrily to E, "Tonight, no matter what, let's go to Moon and have a great time to vent our anger!" E silently agreed.</p>
<p>In Moon, which emitted a ghostly glow like phosphorus, "Wealthy Son" and E were embracing trembling, living flesh. The song strings of the music were pulling out intoxicating dreams. They were immersed in it, they were delighted, and of course, whether they would happily go to class tomorrow was another matter.</p>

<p>After dinner, everyone's faces showed satisfied expressions. Mr. Jiang was picking his teeth, and Mr. Yi, wearing a suit, was holding a cup of tea. They were both lying on the sofa in silence, quietly. Soon, Mrs. Cheng came down from upstairs, carrying her fourth child in her arms. She said;</p>
<p>"I went to the temple fair at Jing'an Temple this afternoon. A stall was full of various colored glass cups, with a sign in the middle saying 'Completely Domestic Products.' I thought, 'I'll buy a few to take back,' but when I picked one up, it was clearly written 'Made in ××' underneath. So I said to the seller, 'Aren't you ashamed?' But he said even better: 'Madam! It's a good price!'... Can you imagine; the Chinese are really incredible!"</p>
<p>"But, Mrs. Cheng! What are you wearing?" This was Mr. Jiang's opening line.</p>
<p>"Me?..."</p>
<p>"You're wearing foreign goods all over yourself, and you're still talking about others!"</p>
<p>"You have to look closely. She's not wearing ×× goods." Mr. Yi suddenly retorted.</p>
<p>"Ah! Yes," Mr. Jiang said again. "Mr. Yi writes articles all day long teaching people to be patriotic, but he himself is wearing the best suit. Haha!"</p>
<p>"So, does that mean that you can't wear a suit and be patriotic? That's really nitpicking." This was Mr. Yi's counter-question again.</p>
<p>"You are a complete nationalist." Mrs. Cheng also chimed in.</p>
<p>"Hahahaha..." The hall was filled with laughter. After a while, they heard Mr. Jiang say, "Let's play a game of mahjong." "Good," Mrs. Cheng agreed first. "Girl, go next door and ask Mrs. Li to come play mahjong."</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Yi sighed in the tone of a scholar:</p>
<p>"Oh! China will not perish. It's truly against heaven's justice!"</p>

When we talk to them, they just claim to be short on cash, or say there are rent-free arrangements being offered elsewhere, and they'll decide later... I don't know how things are on your end?)</p>
<p>A: (It's the same here! Can you think of any solutions?)</p>
<p>B: (Yeah, I guess we're just unlucky.)</p>
<p>A: (That's for sure! But there's worse... I heard that they've already decided to waive rent for the first three months, and reduce rent by × percent from the fourth to the sixteenth month.)</p>
<p>B: (That's terrible! With that, we've already lost the interest, and now they want to waive rent and reduce it by × percent. Won't our commissions also decrease?)</p>
<p>A: (It's the same for me! In any case, the most hateful thing is the ×× army. We wanted them to resist,...)</p>
<p>B: (Yes, otherwise the war might not have happened, and we wouldn't have been affected by rent waivers and reductions!)</p>
<p>A: (Yes, and the ×× army's resistance isn't naturally beneficial to us, and it might not even be beneficial to ××!)</p>
<p>B: (Oh...)</p>

<h3 id="e192">The Total Love of the President <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>"The Total Love of the President" is the latest major silent film. The three main actors are Ivan Mosjoukine, famous for "The White Devil," Miss Suzy, famous for "The Extravagant Life of an Actress," and Mingo, the number one dog star of the time. Having just one of these three stars would be enough to draw crowds, and now with all three, the results are better than anyone expected. Moreover, the plot is noble, implying that one must strive to succeed in life. It offers unique insights on male-female issues, and is especially thought-provoking. Ivan Mosjoukine's artistry has long been praised. He delivers a very strong performance from beginning to end, and the intelligent dog Mingo follows him closely. His comedic moments are hilarious, and his cleverness is astonishing. People sigh that they have never seen anything like it before. This film premiered at the Paris Cinema on Avenue Joffre yesterday, and viewers are full of praise.</p>
<h3 id="e193">The Mysterious and Bizarre (The Poison Arrow Mystery) <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>It was probably about two years ago that a shocking poison arrow case was discovered in a British region, causing quite a stir. Anyone would think that the killer must be a red-haired, green-eyed robber who doesn't bat an eye at murder. But the result was beyond the detectives' expectations; the culprit was actually a beautiful woman. As for the twists and turns of the case and why the beauty committed this illegal act, there isn't time to explain it all now. I heard that the Carlton is showing "The House of the Snow" (The Poison Arrow Mystery). The plot of this film is based on this case, and the male and female actors starring in this film are all famous stars of the silver screen, able to fully bring out the spirit of the case. This is indeed a rare and realistic detective film to see.</p>
<h3 id="e194">The Ethically Bizarre Masterpiece (Iron Evidence) <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>The ethical masterpiece "The Silent Witness" (Iron Evidence), which opens tomorrow at the Nanjing Grand Theatre, is a Fox Film Corporation production based on a world-famous play. The main actor, Rainer Adde-Höhde, is a famous stage star who has starred in the play on Broadway more than two hundred times. His inner and facial expressions are unique, shocking the world of the arts. Greta Nissen, who plays the prostitute, is the star of the sensational "Passion in the Desert." Her passionate performance is extremely intoxicating, making this film the crown jewel of passionate films. The film vividly portrays the love of a father for his son, using a bizarre and unpredictable murder case as the backdrop. The film tells the story of a young man's affair with a prostitute. The woman behaves improperly, and the young man strangles her, but uses too much force, and the woman dies. The young man, frightened and panicked, confesses to his parents. During the confrontation in court, the father tries his best to protect his son, but the ironclad evidence is all there, and even a hundred mouths cannot argue it away. The case is settled, but the one who killed the woman is definitely not the young man. In the end, the truth comes out, and the plot is twisted, bizarre, and unusual.</p>
<h3 id="e195">The Variety of Shows at the Cathay <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>The Cathay Grand Theatre on Avenue Joffre is opening today with the endlessly hilarious comedy "Bean Hunks" (Old Soldiers), starring the comedic duo Laurel and Hardy. The two men's artistic talent is already well-known and needs no introduction. Their previous film, "Pardon Us," which opened in Shanghai, was especially popular. The highlights of "Bean Hunks" are even richer than those of "Pardon Us." Moreover, it is heard that in order to please the audience, the Cathay is also specially adding: (1) A documentary of the Olympic Games, (2) A colorful song and dance film, and (3) "Dog Brothers," a hilarious film starring a full cast of dog stars. Such a program can be said to be all-encompassing, with everything that one could want, and is truly worth seeing.</p>

<p>▲Civil Instructions▲One item: Shen Fugen's application for instructions. After reviewing the application, the content and wording of the document are lacking in clarity. The applicant's purpose for Zhang Pengfei and Wei Maogou's loan pre-seizure case is unclear. The applicant must clearly state it for verification. This instruction. ▲One item: The Huizhong Silver Company's application for execution. After reviewing the application, in the case of the applicant and Kai'aifu Maler's debt execution, Jack Bailuo Sitai and others filed a lawsuit of objection, which has been scheduled by the Civil Court for a hearing on the twelfth of this month. This instruction. ▲One item: The French Electric Company's application for public distribution of execution funds. According to the application, the respondent Liu Zuoruo (transliteration) is located in the residential building at No. 1, Lane 79, Rue Sainte Marie. The movable property in the house has been seized by the court and is about to be auctioned. After ordering officials to investigate the address, the officials reported that there is no Lane 79 on the street, only No. 79, and foreigners reside there, and there is no seizure. The location and number of the lane mentioned may be incorrect, and the original text of the respondent Liu Zuojun's transliteration must also be stated in detail for verification. This instruction. ▲One item: Zhu Qidong's application for a temporary stay of execution. After reviewing the application, this case is executed against Zhu Bingyuan in accordance with the judgment. The applicant claims that Zhu Bingyuan is his father, which is inconsistent with the subject matter. As for the request for a three-month extension before the voluntary relocation, it is also arbitrary and difficult to approve. This instruction. ▲One item: Liu Chenglin's application to receive funds. According to the application, come to the court on the morning of the thirteenth of this month at nine o'clock to receive it. This instruction. ▲One item: Ba Haijin's application to close the case. The application is approved. This instruction. ▲One item: Li Jinsheng's application to receive funds. According to the application, the debtor, Xiechang Timber Company, has not paid the funds and cannot be given the funds. The case should be continued for execution. This instruction. ▲One item: Bi Tehui Ermin's request to suspend execution. According to the application, since it is claimed that the debtor Wu Shaoqin has already stated that he will allocate the debt, the request to suspend execution should be approved. This instruction. ▲One item: Tang Ma Xiaoyuan and others' application for the issuance of a certificate of administration of the estate. According to the application, publish the attached draft continuously in the Shen Bao and News Daily for fourteen days. After the expiration date, submit the newspapers to the court for verification.

This instruction. ▲One item: Taylor Company's application to receive funds. According to the application, the applicant should come to the court at two o'clock in the afternoon on the sixteenth of this month to receive it. This instruction. ▲Public Service Announcement: This is a public service announcement. The case of Dali and Chen Zheming in the past was about rent disputes. Because the whereabouts of the defendant Chen Zheming is unknown, the documents cannot be delivered. Therefore, the plaintiff Dali applied for public service announcement, which has been approved by the ruling. The original judgment that the defendant should receive is hereby publicly announced in accordance with Article 184 of the Civil Procedure Law. Defendant Chen Zheming is hereby notified May 11.</p>
