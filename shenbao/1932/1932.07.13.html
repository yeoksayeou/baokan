<h3>粤中武劇終了彬</h3>
<p>粤中二陳合演之悲慘武劇自上月下旬揭幕亘兩旬餘之苦鬭今以蔡廷楷等之調停始暫告結束當外患日亟國脈絲屬之際而竟又掀起此一番慘毒之混戰豆萁自煎　口但知對内國脈民命皆所不恤彼殘民禍國之軍閥殆眞爲泯盡良知喪心病犯。</p>
<p>自去年九一八禍變突發。國人泣血呼籲。乃得由所謂統一和平會議。造成相安於一時之和平局面。此次陳濟棠企圖集西南海空陸軍權於一身。張惠長去而黄光銳繼掌空軍。空軍亦遂爲陳所私有。獨數艘陳舊之砲艦。尙爲陳策所掌握。乃復下令改編。陳策抗不受命。於是而所謂（剿共）之師。乃正式出動。今陳策己敗北矣。舉目四矚。莫復予毒。彼陳濟棠應亦可以自豪矣。</p>
<p>爲滿個人之私慾。爲快一朝之忿怒。此二旬餘之混亂。在彼軍閥。固爲之興高采烈然而吾人試一計及損失。如飛鷹艦之炸沉。艦身及所儲槍械共值五百餘萬。秀英砲台。亦全部被毁。飛機先後轟炸海口。人民轉徙流離。死傷損失。更不能備舉。此鉅大之犧牲。不爲抗禦外侮。乃爲豆萁自煎。内以動搖我國本。茶毒我人民。外則更以貽笑列强。增重外交上之繁難。彼軍閥之用意。果何在乎。</p>
<p>當混戰開始之初。廢止内戰大同盟瓊州各團體及瓊州旅京滬問鄉。均文電紛馳。呼籲息爭。一部分空軍楊官宇鄧粤銘等離職赴港。發不參加内戰宣言。即中央對此次混戰。亦無可奈何。惟憑（傳聞）與（報載。）電（勸）息爭。然而萬衆之泣血呼籲。終無以阻遏軍閥之横暴。</p>
<p>更有所謂航空將領丁紀徐者。獨於此次混戰。則奮其神勇。盡其神技。出入於海軍高射砲之彈雨中。竟炸沉飛鷹艦。毁滅秀英砲台。（功）成（名）顯。且又自陳濟棠之手中。領得十萬元之賞金。偉矣徐氏。誠不愧爲内戰之健者。獨是此飛鷹軍艦秀英砲台。不燬於外敵。而燬於本國空軍之手。吾人安能不放聲一哭耶。</p>
<p>日前廢止内戰大同盟。特推朱慶瀾查良釗陳立廷等氏赴粤。請願息戰。朱查二氏。邇年致力賑災。備極勤勞。造福災黎。誠不啻萬家生佛，此次復躬冒溽暑。跋涉長途。以謀非戰運動工作之推進。悲壯哉是行。引領南望。國人實不勝其熱望之深且切矣。雖然。此次粤中混戰發動之日。正當國内廢止内戰呼聲囂然塵上之時。呼者自呼。而戰者自戰。吾人從可知和平之非戰。决不足以止戰。此次粤事。即爲吾人最切實之敎訓。吾人獲此敎訓而後。惟有共趨於有效奮鬥之途耳。</p>

<p>日聯十二日東京電國聯調查團本日下午三時在外務省與内田外相作第一次正式會見兩方以日本承認滿洲僞國問題爲中心、交換意見、然其内容嚴守秘密、定於十四日上午十時半續行第二次會見、至四時二十分散會、據聞内田外相率直表明日本不變對滿方針、而關於左項各條、有所力說、（一）帝國政府確信滿洲問題之解决策、須根基於如次原則、（一）解决策須有永久的性質（二）須有排除滿洲將來一切禍根之效力、日政府拒絕不根基於此兩項原則之任何中間的解决案、</p>

<h3>比國工潮嚴重</h3>
<p>全國總罷工已無可避免</p>
<p>軍隊武力彈壓如臨大敵</p>
<p>國民社十二日不魯塞爾電比國目前情勢、全國總罷工似己無可避免、工會聯合會執行委員與社會黨政治委員、昨日深夜舉行聯席會議、决定無論如何定向社會黨總委員會建議宣告全國總罷工、此事將於今日最後决定、此時查勒羅地方形勢益形嚴重、工人　　百人結隊游行街衢間、軍隊則一再應召用剌刀驅逐游行、凡通往城鎭之大道、皆有鐵甲車機關槍隊巡邏、迄今罷工工人被捕者已有一百五十人、</p>
<p>國民社十一日不魯塞爾電比政府派兵赴煤礦工人罷工區域查勒羅與馬謙納地方彈壓之舉、已引起全國工人之憤慨、致工潮有可驚之迅速擴大、今日馬謙納地方工人縱火焚燬資本家房屋數處、並在街中築障礙物、致步兵被迫用剌刀衝擊、又在罷工根據地附近各街道、佈滿破玻璃瓶、以阻馬隊前進、罷工區域内其他各處、遂亦相率仿行、各地現遍佈鐵絲網與障礙物、工人多佔據工廠礦塲、與軍隊對抗、政府以罷工區域皆係操法語民族、爲防免軍隊與人民表同情起見、特派操佛蘭德語軍隊前往彈壓、但因此益引起種族舊恨、反增局勢之嚴重、工潮更迅速蔓延、現已由南境延至白拉朋、恐不日將波及比京、鐵道工人已有加入罷工之恫嚇、而總罷工之呼聲亦日高、指揮查勒羅區軍隊之德摩尼亞將軍猶未宣布戒嚴、顯因内閣不欲增事態嚴重、囑將軍審愼故也、</p>
<p>續訊今日下午及傍晚、罷工區域内形勢雖稍見安靖、但就全體言、尙無顯著進步、比國中部鐵路工人已通過贊成同情罷工决議案、將於星期三實行、社會黨已命令查勒羅全境總罷工、全國礦工聯合會决定召集大會、議定全體礦工立塲、政府曾於下午舉行閣議、比王親自主席、内容未詳、</p>

<h3>英當局否認訂密約</h3>
<p>賠欵戰債相連鎖</p>
<p>對美取聯合行動</p>
<p>國民社十一日倫敦電昨日工黨機關報每日導報載英法意三國對於洛桑公約附有秘密協定消息後、各報頗多轉載、但今日當道已正式聲明不確、宣稱、三國間關於洛桑公約之最後批准事、並無秘密協定或諒解、</p>
<p>國民社十一日柏林電外間盛傳歐洲對德債權國關於對美債務、及彼此間之戰債、曾締結秘密紳士協定、並據美報消息、曾將副本送交德總理巴本等語、今日此間已發半官性質之聲明書、宣稱、各國在洛桑容或締結任何協定、但與德國絕無絲毫關係、且德國於開會之初、即已明白表示絕對拒絕將洛桑公約與舊協約國對美戰債相連鎖、亦絕對不容將其牽入對美聯合陣線之内、再者德政府今亦並未接到此種協定副本云、</p>
<h3>美國戰債政策不變</h3>
<p>國民社十一日華盛頓電頃悉歐洲國家雖有訂結紳士協定、約明洛桑商定之解决辦法、須待美國允减戰債後始生效力消息、但美政府對於戰債政策、依然未變、政府大員對於洛桑公約之附有此種諒解、視爲可異、並表示美國在此時不能再有所讓步、且在十一月選舉總統以前、亦不欲討論减債事、</p>
<h3>英相報告會議情形</h3>
<p>路透十二日倫敦電首相麥唐納今日在下院起立演說洛桑會議之情形、全院皆向歡呼、麥氏宣稱、賠欵長此存在、則經濟不能完全復原、洛桑會議之結果、可使賠欵問題因而解决、蓋非俟德國恢復其世界一份子之地位、則吾人亦無復原之可言也、麥氏繼述及洛桑會議列强間關於戰債前途之所謂（紳士協定、）謂上星期五日德總理巴本曾問以如洛桑計畫失敗、則君能担保再開國際會議否、渠答以（當然、）否則吾人仍將依賴楊格計畫矣、麥氏續謂渠深信洛桑協約不致失敗、大不列顚將竭其力之所能、以使此約成功、麥氏承認與美國籌商協定、實觸及最脆弱之點、但無人有責難美國之權、雖美國未予質言、但渠信各國之願援手以銷除與全世界有關之困難者、莫美國若、首相於是謂洛桑會議僅足銷除歐洲之困難、末謂渠殊反對在日内瓦舉行另一國際經濟會議、</p>
<h3>德國社黨抨擊巴本</h3>
<p>國民社十一日柏林電國家社會黨領袖希特勒、今日在選舉競爭演說中、又發驚人之語、竟稱最近草定之洛桑會議條約、須由德國人民擔負三十萬萬馬克之義務者、將在六個月後不值三馬克云、希氏直指巴本之政府、爲賣國之政府、彼决不使之久居法外云云、希氏復詈現在一般當政者爲叛徒賣國者、而國家社會黨則爲完全德國人惟一之政黨、國家社會黨决不願與他黨混合、或向他黨投降、但願救人民於失望分裂之中、而建設光榮之國家云云、前德意志銀行總裁沙赫爲楊格計劃會議中之德總代表、雖表同情於國家社會黨、但今日發表宣言歡迎洛桑協約、日耳曼國家人民領袖胡根堡之機關報則對於外傳之法英密約、表示疑懼、蓋恐美國與歐洲負債國將來對於戰債爭端不能妥協、則洛桑協約難望批准、而楊格計劃仍將發生效力也、</p>
<h3>法國會信任現政府</h3>

<h3>惠勃爾登中柯顯失敗經過記</h3>
<p>網球大王威名何在</p>
<p>（倫敦通訊）惠勃爾登大會中、網球大王柯顯之敗於考林斯、人莫不引爲怪事、記其比賽情形於次、</p>
<p>惠勃爾登大會之第二日、日薄崎　、此驚人之發現、人所目爲錦標選手柯顯、竟敗於英國前之台杯選手考林斯、六比二、八比六、○比六、六比三去年此時、柯顯亦於大會第二日、於此第一塲上、敗於夏伯、今年捲土重來、滿擬恢復其惠勃爾登往日之光榮、</p>
<p>在考林斯、無人目其爲能敵柯顯者、因此蘇格蘭人考林斯、爲一雙打選手而己、</p>
<p>旣開賽、柯顯以不在乎之態度對之、因彼須以第一盤爲練習也、考林斯於是蒸蒸日上、四比一、五比二、柯顯再放棄末一局、</p>
<p>好戲於是乎開幕矣、柯顯大不滿意於一視線人、一球之來、視線人未之見、而不能决、由裁判决之、如此者、竟一而再、柯顯赫然請另換之、此畢雪潑終於離去、此第二盤第三局之事也、</p>
<p>爭鬭顯然猛烈、柯顯出全力以奪回此第二盤、但考林斯知之己深、依然得寸進尺、</p>
<p>發球者皆勝、考以五比四居先柯顯至此、盡顯其能、以猛力驚人之球、向兩角掃射連獲兩局、考林斯不干屈服、以砲彈之發球反攻、全勝一局、又中二次、此第二盤亦歸考林斯矣、</p>
<p>風雨滿塲、此驚人消息、轟動一時、六千觀衆、竟不料大王之敗一雙打手也、</p>
<p>第三盤柯顯獲兩局、考任其所之、完全放棄六局旗鼓重振、考先勝、柯亦回勝之、於是考大顯顏色、左右進攻、齊向角之深處猛斬、柯顯生死以鬭、終於敗矣、三比一、而四比一、</p>
<p>柯再作背城借一之戰、果獲二局、但考林斯豈將休手乎、</p>
<p>考林斯擊破柯顯之發球、一可驚之過頂重壓及斬球、考勝五比三、</p>
<p>最後一局、柯顯曾幾乎獲勝、但第三次决勝負之一分、考林斯以猛烈之發球、接連一斬、柯顯服服貼貼而敗、</p>
<h3>世界運動會之過去與現在（八）</h3>
<p>（八）歷　届大會田徑賽之回顧（上）</p>
<p>第一届首届大會、於一八九六舉行於希臘京城雅典、田徑項目僅十有二種、成績之幼稚、尙不及我國現下之紀錄、徑賽祇百米·四百米·八百米·千五百米及馬拉松長跑、（按馬拉松跑計程四十二基羅米及一九五米合二十六英里又三百八十五碼、）有百十米高欄而無低欄、田賽方面除現時通行者外、僅少標槍與鏈鍾、鐵餅成績祗九十五呎七吋半、百米爲十二秒、四百米爲五四秒二、高欄爲十七秒五分三、比賽結果、八百米及千五百米爲英國所勝及馬拉松爲希臘所勝外、餘均屬美國之勢力、</p>
<p>第二届一九○○年舉行第二次大會於法國京城巴黎、田徑賽項目由十二項增至二十二項、徑賽自六十米起至千五百米止、跳欄分百十米、二百米及四百米三種、並增二千五百米及四千米跳浜、田賽加十六磅鏈鍾與立定跳高、立定跳遠、及立定三級跳遠等、成績大有進步、如四百米四十九秒四之美國龍氏、高低欄之克拉士林（美）、鏈鍾一百六十七呎四吋之弗浪那根等、均成爲亞林四克史中不朽之人物、比賽結果、英國得三種第一、法國及匈牙利各得一種第一、其餘冠軍、均屬美國、</p>
<p>第三届美國自連得兩次勝利後、興趣益濃、第三届大會遂要求於一九○四年舉行於美國聖路易城、美選手之加人者、十分踴躍、一以地主關係、一以年來之努力、成績突飛猛進、是届大會、可謂美國一國抱總之成績展覽會、他國咸望風披靡焉、田徑賽節目與第二届同、僅少四千米跳浜一項、美國選手包辦全部節目之冠軍、可稱爲歷史上最光榮之一頁、其間如拉而夫羅斯四十八呎七吋之十六磅鉛球成績、跳遠二十四呎之潑林斯頓、弗浪那根再勝抛鏈鍾、以及希爾孟之跳欄、猶深印於近時各國選手之腦海本届世界運動會游泳池</p>
<p>第四届　是届大會於一九○六年又在希臘雅典舉行、成績退步良多、田賽項目取消立定三級跳遠及鏈錘、增加標槍及五項運動徑、賽方面仍回復如第一届之節目、美國仍佔優勝、共得十一項冠軍、英·法·瑞典·坎拿大次之、查是會與第一届相隔十年、希腦委員提議此後仍仿照希臘古代之方式、每四年舉行一會、一致議决、</p>
<p>惟第五届大會因己决定於一九○八年舉行、未便更延、</p>

<h3>三北上江輪</h3>
<p>吳興觸礁沉没</p>
<p>員客幸均救起</p>
<p>本年揚子江上游、常有商輪失事、先有捷江之彝賓、次有太古之萬流、均係觸礁沉没、最近三北公司吳興輪、自重慶下水、行至中途、亦因誤觸暗礁、船身先浸水而沉没、今滬行準備打撈、茲將記者調查所得、詳誌如下、</p>
<p>水激肇禍三北公司之上江輪、行駛重慶宜昌者、有吳興·富陽·兩艘·本月七日吳興輪從重慶載運貨客開赴宜昌、行至雲陽附近七十　地、即前彝賓萬流沉失之處、係在八號午間、近日川江水漲以後、東流非常湍激、江輪下水居常减少速度、免肇意外、詎吳興受激流之衝動、船身失去駕駛力、乃順水向暗礁衝去、欲</p>
<p>挽救停車而已不及、船身竟撞進礁石中、船底便即破裂、</p>
<p>機件損壞吳興觸礁之處、係在中艙之引擎間、船身爲礁石穿破、江水便狂冲入艙、霎時機器間水深五六尺、而引擎陷入水内、鍋爐息滅、行動不能、未久其第一艙亦受暗礁擦損、水亦冲進、而船體乃向下沉、形勢非常危險、</p>
<p>乘客救出在失事之際、船内乘客非常恐慌、紛上艙面甲板冀逃生命、船主見此形狀、即放出求救號信、並拉救命回聲、幸有怡和洋行上游輪嘉和輪經過、得聞警信、便即駛往助救、當派小舢板將吳興輪中搭客、全數救出、代送到宜昌上陸、</p>
<p>船體下沉上海三北公司先得到吳興失事電訊後、至昨日又續得宜昌分局局長任予卿電告、言吴興觸礁後、機器間先浸水、復次　頭艙浸水、船身載重、而又加漫水、初時全船四分之三沉在江内、刻因水激儎重、該輪全身統已没入江中、幸擱在礁石之上、雖沉没尙可撈救也云云、</p>
<p>進行打撈昨日滬局已發急電與宜分局、令任子卿就近先派輪船到吳興失事地點、設法將船内貨物、及其他重要等品、可以起出者、駁起一部、使船身儎脚减輕、一面又令從宜昌派工人技師、帶水泥等到該處、設法將吳興之破洞修補、然後待水勢淺落、便進行打撈手續、查該輪凈量三百噸、行駛川河、約有七年、船貨兩項、估計約在四十萬元、</p>

<p>廢兩改元問題</p>
<p>日來廢兩改元問題、甚囂廛上、此實爲中國革新幣制之當前一問題、其有關於改進金融者甚大、且全國無論商號個人、亦無不有切身之關係、近頃爲此問題作深切之研究以發表意見者、亦已日有其人、本報不憚詞費、特再就訊各專家、一有所得、陸續披露、期多闡發、並供關心本問題者之參考焉、</p>
<p>本日所發表者、爲金融界某君、其人服務金融界歷二十年、經營事業、以穏固聞、且從業之暇、不廢研究、曾本其經騐、有所著述、讀者稱之、蓋事業家而兼學者、讀者或亦讅其人乎、某君之言曰、</p>
<p>廢兩改元一事、國人屬望久矣、綜其便利而簡要者、厥有數端、（一）商家及私人只用銀元一種、省却兩種賬目、（二）金融業亦只用銀元一種、省却兩種賬目、并即省却兩種準備、（三）商家輸入用銀兩、售出用銀元、遂至銀兩銀元發生差率、因而受虧不少、廢兩後可免去此種損失、（四）各地寳銀匯兌折合種種損失、均可免去、而近十餘年來、廢兩改元、亦己成爲必然之趨勢、蓋往時上海多以銀兩爲本位、錢業方面、向來只收存銀、近數年則錢業亦并收銀元、且不特銀行之銀元存欵數、突遇銀兩存欵、即錢業之銀元存欵、亦突過於銀兩存欵、至於最近、則且因銀元充斥、而洋厘遂跌至六錢八分、此時誠爲廢兩改元之絕好機會矣、</p>
<p>以言乎廢兩改元之動機及其歷史、則當追溯及於民國三四年間、其時國人固已熱忱於統一幣制之要改、尤以當時外國銀行勢力偉大、發行甚多、幣制紊亂、爲國人所詬病、蓋外國銀行以鷹洋爲本位也、國人研究結果、遂一致主張非先用國幣銀元爲本位不可、蓋惟先以國幣銀元爲本位、斯能漸漸推行内地、俾各地寳銀由複雜以趨於統一、以便商業、以利金融、厥後政府遂有國幣條例之實行、袁幣之流行市面、亦遂日廣、然袁幣低而鷹洋高、尙未足以言統一也、直至民國八年五四運動之際、各地風潮、牽動及於金融、上海洋厘高至八錢、人心大憤、而調查之結果、中外商人所存之鷹洋、均復無幾、因之由銀行公會錢業公會之努力、議定取消鷹洋行市、市塲流通、只認有國幣···袁幣之一種行市、而硬幣行市、始行統一、（記者按當時外國銀行即如最大之外灘各家所存鷹洋絕少、遠不如其發行之準備額、故時亦俯首無詞、面奔走接洽者、宋漢章氏之力爲多）自後直至民國十六年、國府統一成立、開鑄孫幣、流通日廣、袁幣亦遂減少、孫幣當然即爲國幣、至於今茲、涙埠存銀日少、銀元日多、因之洋厘跌至六錢八分、（記者按滬上存元之多、實以内地萑苻不靖、因而現貨均集中於上海、内地凋敞、正可於此覘之、）於是上海之每日回爐鎔銀元以爲銀塊者、日幾三十萬元、而此所鎔之銀、仍流入外國銀行、夫在此時會、銀元多而銀兩缺、十餘年所圖廢兩改元之機會、幸獲其所矣、</p>
<p>以云廢兩改元、一旦取消沿用之舊制、自不能免於一班人士之懷疑、茲再列舉數則、俾懷疑者有所釋焉、</p>
<p>（一）關稅方面、按海關結算、以關平升銀元、於廢兩改元後、照銀元數比較、若以關平一兩合銀元一元五角九分一釐計、（按此依章乃益君之假定每銀元一元作規元七錢計、）其差額約爲百分之三、即可以增收百分之三、以去年關稅總計之、可多得六百一十萬元、由此推算、即將來換算率銀元一元作規元七錢零五釐或七錢零六釐或七錢一分計算、關稅亦尙有增收、不致短絀、</p>
<p>（二）外匯方面、國外匯兌、但須制定　價、則將來廢兩後、仍可以固定之兌換率計算、如現茲規元一兩合一先令若干辨士、將來一先令合銀元若干、以銀元與外幣爲直接之計算、固毫無關係之事也、</p>
<p>（三）國内匯兌問題、現茲國内各地、實不用銀、雖有各地銀兩之差别、要均以折合上海規元、······上海法定銀兩爲本位、例如蘇州寳銀·漢口洋例銀、在滬亦均須折合上海規元、以内地之本無存銀、而折合上海規元、則上海廢兩改元以後、即可逕合國幣、隨上海以用銀元、益形便利、</p>
<p>（四）債務債權問題、廢兩改元之折算、於今尙未大定、或爲七錢五釐、或爲七錢六釐、或爲七錢一分、然决定實行之日（記者按速則八月一日、遲則九月一日、亦尙未决定、）債權債務、即於是日升算、在商家所欠銀錢兩業之銀兩、升作銀元轉賬時、似有損耗、然銀錢兩業、對於存戸所存之銀兩、亦須照升銀元改給之、銀錢兩業、銀兩存欵不少、故與商家欠銀之升算相差、亦復無幾、銀錢兩業、當無餘利可圖也、</p>

<h3>廢兩改元尙待何時（三）</h3>
<p>江禮璪·</p>
<p>固然、吾人不能以全體之庫存、與鈔票之現金準備、混爲一談、然則銀兩存欵及莊票之現銀準備、在何處乎、據上海工部局前總董費信惇報告、謂上海錢莊所發莊票、每年在市面流通數目、約在二十萬萬兩以上、夫以銀兩爲本位之上海、貿易總數及存欵、不知若干萬萬、無從統計、乃其現銀之準備、連單洋合計、僅有五千三百餘萬兩、最多時亦不過九千五百餘萬兩而已、是紙碼頭乎、現碼頭乎、錢業以匯劃制度之優良、無限責任之信用、發行莊票、而人不見疑、獨謂廢兩改元後、遂有濫發無準備鈔票之危乎、制度而已矣、現碼頭紙碼頭固不足慮者、（四）記帖單位、及一毫二忽五之利益問題、此必非錢業反對廢兩改元之眞原因、夫記帳單位之更改、一轉手之勞耳、折衷行市、定以時日、他處行之而無礙者、上海豈有異乎、至一毫二忽五之利益、本有盤剥之嫌、允宜革而去之、查各國商業銀行、對於商業往來、亦多有收取手續費者、似可仿之改收定章之手續費、以抵補廢兩後之損失、夫商人皆避害而趨利、錢莊營業、穏健敏捷、必自有其存在之價值、决厞恃銀兩以爲維持、故能信用廣溥、久而彌著、否則、旣有一毫二忽五之盤剥、商人亦何樂而必與之往來乎、故廢兩以後、如代以手續費、於錢業仍無所損、如竟能革而免之、則盤剥旣去、招徠益易、人同此心、心同此理、營業之發達、必更較目前爲甚、可以預卜者也、</p>
<p>以上尙爲過去之理由、自淞滬戰後、滬津各處洋底之厚、向所未有、津市有組織公庫消納洋元融通資金之提議、滬厘則已跌至六錢八分零、其原因爲内地農村生產稀少、洋用驟减、而生活必需皆仰外貨、須以銀兩買外匯、兩元二者、旣不能互用、於是銀元供過於求、而銀兩則求過於供、銀元本爲日用貨幣、乃竟無用處、俗諺有看了白米飯挨餓、此之謂也、國難若斯、而仍不謀紓金融界無謂之緊急、是誠何心耶、</p>
<p>原理旣明、今請言其辦法、一·由政府金融業商會立即合組廢兩改元實施委員會、議定銀兩新舊契約及現存規元寳銀之折洋平價、與施行日期、呈同上政府明令公布、强制實行、各地之洋厘行市、即於施行日起停開、二·關稅地丁槪以銀元征收、國際匯兌之市價以銀元計算、國内匯欵匯水以輸送點爲限、三·票據以銀兩計者禁止流通、新發生之銀兩債務、各級法院、槪不受理、四·中央造幣廠從速開鑄、實行自由鑄造、原有各處幣廠並須受其管轄、或竟停辦、以免參差、而歸統一、造幣廠附設化騐委員會、由政府金融業商會合組之、公開化騐、查該廠機件早到、規模爲世界第一、每二十四小時、可鑄幣一百萬枚、上海一埠、日需五六十萬枚、合以寗杭等廠、足供全國之需、果能實行、則銀元之信用供給、兩無缺憾、五·各省各埠不得再有局部禁現出口之令、以暢其流、六·中央中國交通三家應以全力與幣廠合作、充分供給銀元之需要、七·自施行之日起、金融機關不得收受銀兩存欵、兼不得爲銀兩放欵、各業簿記、皆須以銀元爲單位、違者科罰、八·施行之後、如發現仍有國人以銀兩存入外銀行者、查有實據、從重懲辦、並當由政府於施行之時、知會各國使領查照、九·原有爁房主人及夥徒工匠、應送由造幣廠登記雇用、量材任使、以免失業、上列辦法、前四項大都爲金國寳先生原有之建議、作者僅略加補充、特爲聲明、以避掠美之嫌、深望政府與社會、從速實行、則整理幣制之第一步、已告成功、而於國難時間之金融財政、必有不少之便利也、（完）</p>

<h3>琥珀拾芥之考據</h3>
<p>九三老人馬相伯　　翰</p>
<p>自六月十一日發表（原物）語錄以後，先有曹君仲淵詢問（琥珀拾芥）的來歷，已於六月十六日揭載，繼有陶在東李沬二君來稿，亦已先後發表，今曹仲淵君來函考證（琥珀）係譯名，至有意義，特爲發表，相老亦嘗與記者談及，寳石一類很多從外國來的，適與曹君所言互相印證。又嗣後關於本問題之討論文件，請逕函上海汶林路四十八號五十號大華無綫電公司工廠曹君可也，翰誌</p>
<p>琥珀拾芥故事。九三老人曁陶在東李洙二君皆爲文多所引證。散見本刊。鴻博可佩。然仍不能無惑焉。李君引郭璞山海經圖贊。文義與英人所譯略有參差。愚己函詢英人。非其誤譯。卽另有根據。宋雷斅云、琥珀如血色。以布擦熱。吸得芥子者眞也。李時珍必辨爲草禾。而非芥子。不知琥珀擦熱。凡輕燥細小之物、皆能吸取，故寄玩林云、琥珀於皮膚上揩熱。用紙片些少。離寸許映之。自然飛起。廬翻年僅十二。曲鍼腐芥之談。非眞知物理者。雲不從土龍。風不從土虎。王充遂謂假頓牟不能掇芥。假磁石不能引鍼。由今之物理實騐視之。古人之言皆似是而實非也。夷考希臘大哲亞理斯多德所作ＤeAnima一書。己發現琥珀是神秘之物。謂其作用與磁石相同。亞氏生時。在吾國爲商朝武丁以前。時代甚早。隨後希臘羅馬作家如Ｐliny及Ｔhales（希臘大智者七人之一）皆有同樣之紀錄。計算年月。遠在孔子未生之前。古波斯國名琥珀曰Ｋuhruba。義卽拾草芥者。名磁石曰ＡhangRuba義卽吸鐵者。可見二物同功而異性。當時早己發覺。蓋一則靜電。一則磁氣。性質互異。未便混談。紫古人所未知者。迨西元一六○○年Ｄr·Ｇilbert出。始有電氣Ｅlectricity之名。係由希臘文Ｈlektron轉變而來。義亦祇是闡釋琥珀而已。然己遲在吾國明未神宗之季。此西人創見之功也。愚探溯典故。含有二義。一如李君所指示者。一爲何時何氏以摩擦方法得此發明。此義不明惑終未解。至昔明之後。指電爲磁。中西儱侗之見。亘數千年。却屬又爲一事。吾國科學事蹟。往往紀載簡略。嘗草鑽木之類。史書恒以三五言了之。推測拾芥故事、或不在商周之世。因滅於秦火。遂致無從稽考。本文前叚所引諸舊事。皆唐宋以後之作物。其源流何自而來。有能道其詳者。乞有以敎我。</p>
<h3>杭行拾雋</h3>
<p>— 志政</p>
<p>京滬滬杭甬鐵路車務處長鄭揚生氏。比以視察路務。因公赴杭。記者偕行。在杭一日有半。除研究路政興革外。其他見聞所及。頗多足紀者。爰述一二。以留鴻爪。</p>
<p>東北歸客之僞國譚車中邂逅一新自東北歸來之某君。據談僞國情形。頗堪發噱。溥儀名爲元首。實則如同囚犯。任何人非得日人允詐。不得往見。前吉林財廳長旗人崇厚因係親貴。曾一度叩見皇上。事爲日人偵知。隨加扣押。溥儀本人之臥榻上。亦裝有收音機。即夫婦間之谈話。日人亦可清晰聞之。其苦痛可知矣。鄭孝胥名爲行政院長。實則形同傀儡。除曾委其子爲一秘書外。其餘雖一下級員司。亦不能直接委任。大權純操於日顧問之手。鄭氏晚節如此。亦可嘆矣。僞國於調查團將到時。某日忽大張布告。謂在某處演戲。看客不但不取票資。且奉贈小洋二角。饅首一枚。一時闔城轟動。爭往一觀。豈知入戲園後。由招待者導入一室。令每人簽姓名住址職業於預置之簿上。然後付給酬資。當時尙不知其用意何在。其後調查團抵瀋。日人即將此簿交出。曰凡簽名者。皆請願調查團承認僞國者也。其他類似之滑稽趣事。不一而足。此外電報函件。無不檢查。惟彼認爲有反動嫌疑之函電。并不扣留。照常遞送。收電人於五日内向警廳聲明理由者。或可免究。否則期限一過。瑯璫入獄矣。</p>
<p>杭垣之酷熱車過嘉興。天氣漸熱。抵杭。尤酷熱不可耐。入夜更甚。湖水如沸。令人却步。昔人謂杭州四圍皆山。如處釜底。誠信然矣。晚杭站同人公宴處長於鐵路寄宿舍。濟濟一堂。開空前未有之盛况。鄭處長即席演說。詳述一二八事變處置經過。并以合作互助相勉勗。翌晨處長以莫干山旅舍尙待規劃。特往視察。予因事先返。笑語送行諸君曰。從此脫離熱海矣。相與軒渠不置。</p>
<h3>楊梅</h3>
<p>— 持佛</p>
<p>在梅雨溜簷身鍼剌水的时候，楊梅又上市了。樹樹綺，霞顆驪珠，我們在山野閒步，委實令人　涎欲滴。唐張泌詩道：（高林帶雨楊梅熟）。這是一個實在的情形。所以楊梅雖是温帶的植物，而宜於濕熱的山地，性質和（一騎紅塵妃子笑）的荔枝很是相同。我們浙東，負山瀕海，海產固然豐富，鮑明遠給他妹子書裏所說，仕麽豚首，象鼻，芒鬚，針尾之族，石蟹，土蚌，燕箕，雀蛤之儔，折甲，曲牙，逆鱗，反舌之屬，那一種没有。便就山地出品，像楊梅也可與枇杷，荔枝，林擒媲美了。博物志說：（地有章名，則生楊梅。）譬如慈谿，古名勾章，所以產楊梅很多。丨尤其是西鄉所產，名喚（菩薺種）的，核小味甜，尤爲著名。此外像浙江的上虞，江蘇的洞庭，也產楊梅。又有一種白楊梅，色較普通的爲澹，味也很甜。相傳杭州有楊梅塢，塢裏有一個姓金的老婆子，因爲伊所種的楊梅很好，所以（楊梅塢）（金婆楊梅）便出名了。東坡筆記說：（梵天寺有月廊數百間，庭前多楊梅。）他老人家詩裏所說：（夢遶吳山却月廊，楊梅盧橘覺猶香。）便指這事。</p>
<p>楊梅詩很多：東坡又有一首道：（南村諸暢北村盧，白華青葉冬不枯：丨楊梅爲常綠喬木，生於山中，春日開黄白花。丨垂紅綴紫烟雨裏，時仁荔枝爲先驅）。陸放翁道：（未愛滿　堆火齊，丨楊梅一名火齊，又名火實·丨先驚探頷得驪珠。）宋正平道：（五月楊梅己滿林、初疑一顆價千金：味方河朔葡萄重，色比濾南荔支深。（又道：（項里楊梅鹽可撤。）丨按楊梅富果酸，於胃腸可補助消化，於牙磁則有侵蝕之害，故宜和鹽而食。李白詩曰：（玉盤楊梅爲君設，吳鹽如花較白雪，持鹽把酒但飲之，莫學夷齊事高潔。）可知楊梅調鹽而食，由來已久矣。丨楊誠齋道：（玉肌半醉紅生粟，黑暈微生染紫囊。）都是詠楊梅的佳句啊。</p>
<h3>值得介紹之國貨工廠（四）</h3>
<p>— 何躬行</p>
<p>（五）造冰工廠</p>
<p>上海造冰工廠有十家左右。國人開設者。查有三家較大。如高昌廟之廣業。康腦脫路之洽龍。</p>
<p>。虹口之治和等是也。外人開設者。英商有同茂上海茂昌等三家。日商有東方一家。而同茂尤大。日出冰。可三十五噸。市價每噸洋十五六元。</p>
<p>造冰機器。一名冷汽車。小者每部價洋四五千元。大者須萬餘元矣。</p>
<p>造冰時間。約須二十四小時。除安置冷水及少量鹽水隔離外。在車旁之鐵管中。加入相當分量之阿木尼。此阿木尼。爲造冰時必不可少之物。阿木尼。係英美貨。每筒一百磅。市價銀八十兩。</p>
<p>（六）汽水工廠</p>
<p>汽水爲夏令飲料。檸檬消食。橘汁强胃。沙示水去濕清血。薑啤水益氣暖肚。均有益衛生者也。外貨正廣和汽水每遇夏令。風行一時。其業本輕利厚。每年利權之外溢。不可計數。製造汽水機件。有製水貫糖濾水洗瓶等器。其最困難者。一瓶類之製造。二菓汁之製造。二者均有國貨。不能適用。前聞屈臣氏廠。對於瓶汁兩項。十分研究。仍難解决。深望上項三種工業家。互相研究。急起直追。庶有豸乎。</p>
<p>其工作機器。大小不一。出貨各異。大約製水車。每日每車可出水一千五百打。造冰車。出冰二噸左右。他若洗瓶機裝寨機低塞機炭酸機等。無一非外貨也。</p>
<p>國貨汽水廠。以屈臣氏最大。成立己三十年。於民國十三年五月。始歸國人自辦。資本三十萬元。去年營業計洋二十四萬元。其次益利惠司攝生。總計四家。</p>
<h3>談屑</h3>
<p>— 流沙</p>
<p>爛鈔票外國銀行裏發行的鈔票，如有破舊殘損的，常由銀行方面調換新的出來，祗有中國的鈔票，一經發行，不到銀行倒閉總是在無盡止地流通着，雖至霉爛，花紋糢糊，破如蛛網，積垢如漆布也絕不計也。近來，有一個醫科學生，無意間取一張鈔票將顯微鏡一騐，竟意外地發發現到上面有微生蟲三萬六千之多，據說那微生蟲都是有毒的，能傳染疾病給人家。</p>
<p>酒與烟世界上，吃酒的人最多的，要算是比利時了，那邊每有三十六人的地方，必定會有一爿賣酒店，世界上吃鴉片的人最多的，要算乂國了，那邊滿街走的人都是鶴繝蜂腰面面有土色的，况且最近要實行鴉片公賣了。</p>
<p>非洲人說者總以爲非洲人是天生的黑，生下來，不，簡直在娘肚皮裏就黑了，這話，看來是正確，其實竟大錯了。非洲的孩童，剛生下的時候是潔白的，可是生下不上一年就變成紫顏色了，此後，一天黑似一天，到三十歲的時候，對不起，就成爲漆精了。</p>
<h3>觀（慈母）影片後</h3>
<p>— 江壽伯</p>
<p>看明星公司的（慈母）無聲影片、假使來比西片的（慈母），自然情形不同，但是有一點我倒非常佩服該公司的成功，就是化裝方面，嚴月閒，她是一個肥碩的大胖子，面孔上的肉來得個多，本來的相貌，頗具青春美的，此刻在戲裏面，竟然會得變成雞皮鶴髮的老婆婆，就是走路，說話·一舉一動尙不失其體態，是爲難能·</p>
<p>顧梅君，她唱京戲倒還老到，自從進明星，僅在（銀星幸運）中一度出演，顯見得有些生澀，在這裡，我倒覺得梅君進步得很快，她在法庭代賈海泉開罪，侃侃而談，一種活潑神態，很能表曝出馮姑的能幹來，鄉郊河泮一塲，取景幽倩，爲全劇冠，</p>
<p>王獻齋的賈海泉，分三個時期，起初是一個壞蛋，到監裏是已經有些懺悔了·後來，經賢母良妻的感化，也變成一個善良之輩了·獻齋在這三個時期裏，表演的着力，實已到爐火純青之候·</p>
<p>湯傑的馮大，王微信的曹四，黄君甫的鄉下先生，均平平·黄君甫做滑稽獻，天賦的一副怪臉，可惜現在已經瘦得多了·</p>
<p>至於全劇的編製，程小青君能運用其聰敏的頭腦來支配它，所以非常緊張和動人，張石川君導演得不失原意，尤能應用小動作助長它的精神，我觀國產征，不願多許人，這一張（慈母），倒覺得還滿意呢·</p>
<h3>古廟敲鐘錄（四九）</h3>
<p>— 不除庭草齋夫</p>
<p>五十三</p>
<p>說來眞奇怪，朱先生的問題是没有問題了。這些日子再也没有一個人提到他那背榜的一回事。連老許自己也夾在棍隊裏很起勁的上操。張鬍子不知怎的也回來了，在農人武力保護之下大抽他的鴉片烟。他是超過了强迫軍事訓練的年齡所以他也不須上操，不須守夜。他居然成了我們村莊裏最舒服的一個人。</p>
<p>五十四</p>
<p>開學的好日子丨三月十五丨到了。小孩子，換得一身新鮮，很早就一</p>
<p>個的來了。他們好像是過新年一樣的高興。的確這在他們的生命史上是</p>
<p>一個新紀元。他們自己是不是已經預料到，我除非是重生爲一個小孩子</p>
<p>能體會出來呢？</p>
<p>春生團長下了一個命令說今天第一次開學是本村一件大事，要團員全體武裝參加開學典禮。一時步槍隊，獵槍隊，劍隊，刀隊。槍隊，棍隊，加上臨時組織的鋤頭隊，鐮刀隊足足有二百人，擺着隊伍，吹着鼓手，放着爆竹，繞着全村走到古廟來。朱先生和江營長說這樣莊嚴威武的開學是從來没有見過的。城裏民衆學校開學有時找幾個童子軍帮帮忙，或是雇一個軍樂隊助助威，那不過是裝裝門面罷了。但是今天我們親眼所看見的是全村的小孩子在全村人民自己的武力保護之下上學，這裏面所包的意義是豐富無比了。</p>

<h3>糧食　米市續跌二角</h3>
<p>滬南　昨日各路來船約抵十五六號、查浦存漸漸濃厚、城鄉店銷及門市减少、金融緊迫、兼之洋米棧積日豐、是以人心一蹶不振、去胃鮮者稍有、做開厚粳行情又短角許、早晚稻到積雖寥、價亦跟削角外、</p>
<p>新閘昨日西路到船有限、惟常錫北粳及江陰宜興米來貨尙湧、本街交易日呆、開出盤價降低二角、薄早稻鄉莊帮略有去胃市疲角許、洋杜尖貨稀銷淡、市居續疲、變陰元去胃薄弱、幸貨無多、市乏升沉、</p>
<h3>北洋帮續辦洋米</h3>
<p>行情步小公會有維持之議</p>
<p>昨日洋米市况、愈形不振、小絞米續小角許、本街去胃仍呆、惟北洋帮如天津等埠、以滬市一再疲小後、與該市頗可合划、隨市辦去小絞米二千多包、本街散戸等辦去小數小絞外、又去西貢米二百包、價亦較上週小去角許、統市開一號西貢二百包、價十一元、小絞二千七百包、價九元四角至二三角、洋米市存百多萬包、定貨未到亦有五十萬以上、市價步小、人心浮動、昨米業公會有維持之議、但尙無妥善之辦法云、</p>
<h3>標粉收前交旺市挺</h3>
<p>粉交十三起至八月三日止祗做前市</p>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、大　呈盤旋之象、以洋麥報價又小一二角左右、惟抛戸甚稀、大廠朱出、買方均在觀望、致交易甚寂、半日祇做三萬餘包、迨初下午開盤、人心稍好、頭三盤交易依然不旺、後三盤交旣暢盛、市亦步挺、聞係天津帮續辦大批現貨、福新阜豐兩廠共成交十萬包、天津交貸、仍開一兩九錢一分、因之人心轉佳、後步如實銷接續、或可站定也、結果七月份較前日漲二分、八月份漲一分二厘半、九十月份漲一分、十一十二月份漲一分二厘半、又麵粉交易所因近日天氣酷熱、依照歷年慣例、并經全體之要求、定木月十三日起至八月三日止、祇拍上午半日、下午不拍、惟上午改九時半開拍、并多拍三盤、計共六盤云、</p>
<h3>麥市成互擯之局</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份大致均景盤旋之態、因洋麥報價又小一二角、惟現麥市值雖廉、廠胃則尙殷切、故抛戸甚稀、不過做多者終因洋麥之步落、亦不敢嘗試、致勢成互擯、出入無幾也、結果本月份較前日大一分、六月份小一分、餘無比較、現麥市况、仍見平穏、廠胃尙活絡、開直塘麥二兩八錢三四分、常熟麥二兩八錢七分、崑山麥二兩七錢九分、次至七錢半、白鶴巷麥二兩七錢六分、夏家橋麥二兩八錢、計二千餘包云、</p>
<p>絲茶　浙屬雙宫繭運滬不溺</p>
<p>繭上市後運滬　七百　担</p>
<p>浙屬今歲春　汎因春雨連　、春寒料峭、致繭產以雙宫繭居多、滬市雙宫繭鎖路灘滯、而運滬數量不弱、自新繭上市迄今、浙　雙宫繭運　達七百餘担、均分有各銀行　棧待售云、</p>
<h3>路莊珍眉歐銷活動</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊茶市、屯溪婺東歙縣遂安等路之珍眉綠茶、英商錦隆·怡和·福時·同孚等行均起動辦、其他各歐　行家、亦接到國外訂購電報、預備搜辦、路莊珍眉市面、己届活動時機、華茶商以現下珍眉市盤、非特虧折甚鉅、卽擬補充予茶、亦無從購買、因此態度一致堅硬、據一般茶商觀察、珍眉針眉秀眉蝦目等貨、市價均有回漲之勢、惟貢熙一項、白頭莊銷胃不夫、俄莊又非廉不購、情勢難望轉佳云、</p>
<h3>南北貨早紅枝昨己開出</h3>
<p>新徐州菜售十七兩</p>
<p>前日由海瑞輪運到之首批早紅枝計二十七箱昨己見樣、因初次見新、貨身較軟、個子中中、以爲數不多、得兌十七兩、然按諸成本、仍須虧折、後批如多到、或須略少也、</p>
<p>新金針菜、前後共到二批、計徐州菜共三十餘小包、今庚出水頗佳、均開十六兩、旋由各行以十七兩、全數售通、陳貨存底尙多、極難轉好、現市高莊己乏、普通自十二兩起次至七八兩不一、</p>
<h3>煤炭　山西煤市價慘跌</h3>
<p>各種白煤銷路、近因天氣酷熱、用度銳减、市塲交易異常清淡、故價日見疲軟、而山西塊煤銷路更弱、其存煤亦較他煤爲多、故售價每噸自十九兩己跌至十六兩、舉一般人之眼光、日後尙須下跌云、</p>

<h3>自殺之眞相（續）</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>昨天因爲自殺之眞相一書，我拉拉批扯說了許多廢話，其實若照我的意見實行，必定可减少青年的煩悶，和自殺的數量，因爲意猶未盡，今天再來補充數語。</p>
<p>經濟壓迫和戀愛問題，的確原是兩件事，但其中很有連鎖的關係，因爲我是一個飽受此中經騐的人，於經濟壓迫的條件下，掙扎了幾十年，還是没有解决的一個，言之自覺親切有味，現在一般大學堂學生，或中學堂學生，亦有此種風氣，書還没有讀好，大家拼命去談自由，去談戀愛，把自己應該研究的學科，反抛諸腦後，這眞是大錯而特錯，大誤而特誤。</p>
<p>你們要談戀愛麽？我今天把兩個古人來做個榜樣，假定諸位達到了戀愛的目的，而遇着這樣一個境地，試問諸位作何感想，作何辦法，眞是死路一條。　　漢朱買臣，家貧好讀書，常賣薪自給，且行且讀，其妻羞之，下堂求去，買臣曰，我年五十當富貴，汝苦日久，待我貴，當報汝，妻曰，若待汝貴，則余餓死久矣，不聽，去適農夫。</p>
<p>又漢王章爲諸生時，求學長安，獨與妻居，章疾病無被，臥牛衣中，涕泣與妻訣别，其妻呵怒之。</p>
<p>假定諸君討着了一位摩登的女郎，而没有生活的能力，偏遇着了這樣的情形，試問痛苦不痛苦？能受不能受？不但如此，古人說（一人變兩難，兩人變三易），變愛之後，戀愛的結晶品，阿大阿二阿三······一個個從製造廠裏製造出來，使你的負擔一天加重一天，痛苦一天更深一天，這眞是于右任先生所謂難過了。</p>
<p>兒子漸漸大了，去受敎育罷，這樣貴族化的學堂，如何讀得起，不去受些敎育罷，戀愛的結晶，是否去敎他做土匪，做流氓，做光蛋，并且現在的時候，就是好好地良民，不是一批一批朝着敵人砲火裏送，便是一批一批朝着自己軍閥砲火裏送，試問製造國民者甚麽意義，舍此不談，而衣食住行，已足夠你受用了。</p>
<p>即使你的兒子，養得聰明伶俐，飛黄騰達，做官僚，做富翁，也是兒子媳婦幸福，與你老子有甚麽相干，假定你抱獨身主義，因爲獨身，生活上必比較减輕一些壓迫，并且我主張的獨身主義，原不是絕對的，是相對的，假定你有了生活能力，有了固定職業，就把獨身主義一變而爲雙身主義，亦未始不可。并且現在的婚姻制度，是靠不住的，所謂（田舍翁多收十斛麥，尙欲易妻），你看現在所謂要人，因爲一躍而變爲做官階級，就把從前的柴米夫妻，不是離異，便是抛棄，再來追求一個摩登女郎，盡盡義務，若照我的主張，亦可省却一番離異手續，這何憚而不爲呢。</p>
<h3>愁中寄友</h3>
<p>— 周大炎</p>
<p>一昨忽接吾友周君大炎來一函，啓視之，乃係詩稿數首，因錄之投於本刋，以供同好，澤永附註</p>
<p>男兒何事涕滂沱，屈指前塵比夢多，蓮采並頭憐子曲，柳迷望眼懊儂歌，千秋隠痛同如此，兩字傷心是奈何，一點痴魂一點涙，安排恨海釀情波，</p>
<p>買春曾典鷫鸘裘，犢鼻當爐韻事留，信爲有心終近恨，愛餘半面易成憂，擾人百感風兼雨，伴我雙魔病共愁，同穴誓言知已感，天荒地老願難酬。</p>

<h3>魚肝油的製法</h3>
<p>— 瀛洲</p>
<p>魚肝油一物，服之能補血治肺，其效至大，年來行銷於國中甚多，大都係舶來製品，利權外溢，實深浩嘆，按此種製油原科，採自　魚（即鰵魚）肝臟，我國山東石島地方，出產甚豐，本爲漁民鹽藏乾製　魚時廢棄之物，若欲收集原料，並不需若何資本，故深望有志實業者前往採辦仿製，亦振興國貨之一途也，謹將其製法介紹如次。</p>
<p>（甲）熬取法</p>
<p>此法直將多量原料，投於釜中，徐徐加熱熬煑，融出之油，由傍汲取，時時取殘滓，更投新原料，繼續工作，最後將殘滓壓榨，以榨出剩餘之油，此法所用燃料，須用薪材，蓋用石炭，則熱度過激，油因焦灼着色，用薪材則可免此虞。</p>
<p>（乙）精製法，此法有數種，茲舉其常用者如次。</p>
<p>（一）洗滌法所得之油，含有多量夾雜物即蛋白質，粘液質，塵埃等，發生惡臭，易於腐敗，故採取後，須注加多量之水攪拌洗滌，靜置之，則油呈透明層，將此層汲出，再行加水，如此數次，可得透明之油。</p>
<p>（二）靜置法將油類注入容器，長期靜置，則不純物沈澱，油則形成透明層，汲取之，可得透明之油，又將油注入淺器，使日光直射，長期靜置，如此則油分不生變化，然夾雜物酸化分解，漸次漂白，亦屬有效。</p>
<p>（三）濾過法此法係最普行之方法，即依前記方法將漂白靜置之油汲取之，使通過濾紙木炭末等層，濾過時，可得更透明之油，又近來將砂與粘土混和油内，稍行加熱，使吸收臭氣或夾雜物，再行濾過，更可獲良好結果。</p>
<p>（四）加酸精製法油内加硫酸時鹽類成爲硫酸鹽類，而溶解其他污物，則炭化沈澱，硫酸對油雖呈激烈作用，然用少量殊奏精製之效，約將百分之一稀釋於容積等分水中，注加後加低度温度，如有污物沈澱則除去之，油分以清水洗凈，以不呈酸反應爲止。</p>
<p>家　向題</p>
<h3>反了反了</h3>
<p>— 岩野</p>
<p>金太太近來見了人，輒說（反了反了·）人家對於她這（反了反了）的意義，都不能了了，要想向她問個明白罷，但見她那種冰霜的怒容，而又不敢啓齒，</p>
<p>上星期的某日，東鄰王家嫂嫂爲剛週月的兒子開湯餅筵，金太太以多年鄰居之誼，過去道賀，給他們留爲座上客，席問大半相識，吃吃笑笑，笑笑談談·不覺談起媳婦來了·金太太一談到媳婦，頓時（反了反了）又脫口而出·同席沈老太要問她這（反了反了）好久了，今日這個好機會，那可輕易錯過，便乘勢說道；金太太丨什麽（反了反了）你說得好久了，究是什麽意思？金太太也覺得今天有傾吐這秘密的必要了，便歛了笑容說：我兒子去年和我媳婦訂婚後，今年在這次砲火聲中，便草草娶了回來·雖然砲火驚心，但爲兒子了却婚姻大事，也是一樂因爲受了戰事影響，一切圖個省儉，所以女僕也不用了，家中事皆自己動手，新婦初到，大家還很客氣，所以我也不要她做什麽，一切洗衣燒飯等事，都由我一手包辦，不要她費什麽心，勞什麽力，我把飯菜一一搬到桌上，然後去呌她和兒子出來吃飯，大家吃好了，我再一一搬進放好洗好，她和兒子則早已房中去了·過了一禮拜，我覺得不能不開口了，但是新婦究竟還客氣，不好意思親口和她說，便呌了兒子來·偷偷的和他道：我也五十多歲了，素來有僕人服侍，舒適慣的，現在我們圖個節省，不用女僕，而添了一個媳婦·我本不想媳婦來服侍我，祗求她來帮帮我忙·現在已一禮拜過去了·我想明天就請她出來主持中饋·如果說是生手生脚，那末一切有我指點，你去和她說，明天我一定辦理移交，當天兒子没有回復·明天早上十點鐘了，他們還房門嚴閉，深深睡着·我想再遲小菜場上要没有好貨了，便自己去買了菜回來，他們房門也開了·我呌了兒子出來對他說：菜己買來了，呌媳婦快來揀洗罷丨我說話的聲音故意高些，料想她聽見了一定就會出來的，那知我的話剛畢，房裏就發出比我聲音更高地說：我不會燒飯，我没有學過燒飯，我也不會服侍人家，我是受人家服侍慣了的·我爲保持家中和氣，便忍着氣仍自己去工作·直到今天，這付担子仍壓在我肩上，照這樣的婆婆服侍媳婦，母親服侍兒子，不是反了，是什麽呢？</p>
<p>金太太說到這裏，大家都起了深深的太息，沈老太又問道，你媳婦這樣吃了不做事，那末她做什麽呢？金太太又說：她還比我還忙哩！天天早上十點多起牀，呌我兒子去泡了水來洗面，照着鏡了，搽粉哩，畫眉哩，染指哩，終要忙到一個鐘頭，休息了一回，便要吃飯了·飯碗放去，又是洗面搽粉畫眉染指·一切完畢了，便或和兒子出去走走，或在家白板中風弄個八圈，晚上終要到十二時才登牀·這便是他們的日常功課·沈老太又問她是怎樣的人家人，金太太說，牠是一個女學生，在一個什麽中學讀書的，還没有畢業，因爲到了我家，便也不去讀了，我眞不懂，女子讀了書，連家中一些事都不會做，那末這書讀它有什麽用呢？</p>
<p>隨便談談</p>
<h3>揮汗漫筆</h3>
<p>— 幸</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>當你酒醉飯飽之後，你的最適宜的事，是莫過於依偎在你的含有詩意的愛人的懷裏的顫着聲音說：（愛人生是多麽空虚呵）！</p>
<p>但當你不僅是酒未醉而且飯飽的時候，你便須切記着這句話於你是用不着。因爲（人生空虚）之苦，究不如（肚皮空虚之痛）</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>一個詩人從半夜的殘夢中醒來，望望冷冷的照在窗上的月色，起坐，倒下一杯隔夜的冷茶，喝下，其味澀而微苦，於是喟然長嘆曰：</p>
<p>（你隔夜的冷茶喲，</p>
<p>是象徵着苦澀的人生喲！）</p>
<p>望望月，月還是那樣冷冷地，四壁靜寂得没有一點迥聲，詩人，終於頽然倒下，未幾，詩意的鼾聲又作。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>細微的青蟲望見了燈光，一羣一羣的自窗外飛來我的案上，我用筆寸一個一個的戮死，頃刻便堆下了一大堆的遺骸。在這生命的游戲之下，我應到了勝利者的驕傲，也感了失敗者的悲哀！</p>
<p>然而誰呌牠投向光明呢？青蟲的不是應該的嗎？</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>傍晚，突地黑雲四起，狂風大作，電閃雷吼，接着便是傾盆大雨。一隻黑狗颤慄在風雨衷，纍纍然。一個儍孩子說：（狗，看你往那裏逃？）</p>
<p>（五）</p>
<p>每次走過南京路的時候，我總不敢抬起頭，因爲我怕看見那紛紛擾擾的（人間獸）狂奔，我怕看見那裝載着血肉的汽車的羣狂奔，然而望着地下，地下也似乎是滿舖着血，滿舖着肉。我祗好閉起眼睛，眼前火星飛迸，我又恍忽看是地底下遍埋着地雷！</p>
<p>我想，這地雷總有一天會爆發罷！</p>
<p>車</p>
<h3>現代女予的謬誤觀念</h3>
<p>— 金楠</p>
<p>現在一般婦女，以爲打扮得時髦，就算是新女子？有了這樣極大的謬誤觀念，於是許多婦女都在修飾上做功夫，偏重歐化，藉以騙得新女子的頭銜，博男性們喝一聲贊美的采。在這種情形結果之下的新女子，便成爲旣不服務社會，更不盡力家庭的特種腐蠧者，天天不但飽食終日，無所事事，還一味的向丈夫或者家長伸手要錢，穿着奢華的衣服，抹上濃厚的脂粉，看看電影，跑跑無聊的宴會，做出風頭的妓女式的交際，最滑稽的。她們一面盲目地喊着婦女解放的高調，但一面反在開低級自己地位的倒車。只要講現在不少已受過新敎育的女子，有幾個，能經濟獨立，能婚姻美滿，能改良家庭的環境，有幾個於社會有一點兒貢獻，能替國家盡一分責任呢？</p>
<p>我們縱不該籠統的這樣嚴重地來責備一般時髦的新女子·丨丨崇拜物質文明的新女子。更絕對不是侮辱女性，不過是客觀的理論，同時對謀提高女權者實抱莫大的杞憂吧！</p>
<p>最後敬以萬分熱誠，希望新女子們（不要在形式上新，</p>
<p>是要在精神上新。）</p>

<h3>對白</h3>
<p>— 孟遠</p>
<p>伴娘：（當你行婚禮的時候，你的神情，似乎很不安，好像有些驚怕的樣子。新娘：（初次爲此，終不免有些局促，只好留待下次當心了·）</p>
<p>男：（美麗的花，甜蜜的糖，這是增加愛情的妙品。）</p>
<p>女：（哎！戒子不是很好的嗎？）</p>
<p>職員：（經理先生，我現在結了婚，便增加了負擔，可否請你加一些薪水？）</p>
<p>經理：（店外闖的禍，與號中是無涉的。）</p>
<p>男：（親愛的！請你以後，嘴唇上不要搽胭脂。）</p>
<p>女：（爲什麽？？···）</p>
<p>男：（因爲我昨夜回去，我的妻子，發覺了我和你接過吻！）</p>

<h3>End of Martial Drama in Guangdong</h3>
<p>The tragic martial drama jointly performed by the two Chens in Guangdong, which began in the latter half of last month and lasted for more than twenty days of bitter fighting, has now temporarily come to an end with the mediation of Cai Tingkai and others. At a time when foreign troubles are pressing and the nation's fate hangs by a thread, this cruel and poisonous civil war was actually stirred up. It is a case of brothers killing each other. These warlords, who harm the people and bring disaster to the country, have truly lost their conscience and become heartless criminals who care only about internal struggles and have no regard for the nation's fate or the people's lives.</p>
<p>Since the sudden outbreak of the September 18th Incident last year, the people of the country have been crying out in bloody tears. Only then, through the so-called Unity and Peace Conference, was a temporary state of peace achieved. This time, Chen Jitang attempted to gather the power of the Southwest's naval, air, and land forces into his own hands. Zhang Huichang left, and Huang Guangrui succeeded him as commander of the air force. The air force thus became Chen's private property. Only a few old gunboats were still under the control of Chen Ce. Then came the order for reorganization. Chen Ce resisted the order. Thus, the so-called (Communist suppression) troops were officially dispatched. Now Chen Ce has been defeated. Looking around, no one dares to oppose him anymore. Chen Jitang should be able to feel proud of himself.</p>
<p>For the sake of satisfying personal desires and venting momentary anger, this twenty-odd days of chaos, for those warlords, was a time of great excitement. However, let us try to calculate the losses. For example, the Feiying warship was sunk, with the ship itself and the stored weapons worth more than five million. The Xiuying Fort was also completely destroyed. Airplanes bombed Haikou one after another, and the people were displaced and suffered. The deaths, injuries, and losses are too numerous to mention. This huge sacrifice was not made to resist foreign enemies, but for brothers to kill each other. Internally, it shakes our national foundation and poisons our people. Externally, it is a laughingstock for the great powers and increases the difficulties in diplomacy. What exactly is the purpose of these warlords?</p>
<p>At the beginning of the civil war, the Abolish Internal War Grand Alliance, various groups in Qiongzhou, and fellow Qiongzhou natives in Beijing and Shanghai all sent numerous telegrams, calling for an end to the fighting. Some air force officers, such as Yang Guanyu and Deng Yueming, resigned and went to Hong Kong, issuing declarations of non-participation in the civil war. Even the central government was helpless in this civil war, relying only on (rumors) and (news reports) to (persuade) for a cessation of hostilities. However, the tearful appeals of the masses could not stop the warlords' tyranny.</p>
<p>Moreover, there is the so-called aviation general Ding Jixu, who, during this civil war, demonstrated his bravery and skill to the fullest extent, entering and exiting the rain of naval anti-aircraft artillery fire, and actually sinking the Feiying warship and destroying the Xiuying Fort. (He) achieved (fame) and received a reward of 100,000 yuan from Chen Jitang. Great is Xu! He is truly worthy of being a champion of civil war. However, this Feiying warship and Xiuying Fort were not destroyed by foreign enemies, but by our own country's air force. How can we not cry out loud?</p>
<p>Recently, the Abolish Internal War Grand Alliance specially dispatched Zhu Qinglan, Zha Liangzhao, Chen Liting, and others to Guangdong to petition for an end to the war. Zhu and Zha have devoted themselves to disaster relief in recent years, working extremely hard and benefiting the disaster victims. They are truly like living Buddhas to the people. This time, they braved the summer heat and traveled long distances to promote the non-war movement. How tragic is this journey! Looking south with anticipation, the people of the country cannot help but feel their deep and earnest hope. However, the day this Guangdong civil war broke out was precisely when the call for abolishing internal war was at its loudest in the country. Those who called out, called out, and those who fought, fought. We can thus know that the peace of non-war is definitely not enough to stop war. This Guangdong affair is our most practical lesson. After we gain this lesson, we can only all move towards the path of effective struggle.</p>
<p>National Important Telegrams</p>
<h3>Resignation of Judicial and Administrative Ministers Luo Wen'gan and Zheng Tianxi</h3>
<p>Handling of the Noulens case is difficult; will not go to the ministry to work starting today.</p>
<p>Luo issues a statement that once the wind of coercion is opened, the law will lose its force.</p>
<p>Cites the British government's disregard for the hunger strike of the Irish mayor as evidence.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Minister of Justice and Administration Luo Wen'gan and Deputy Minister Zheng Tianxi have encountered many thorns and difficulties in handling the Noulens case. On the evening of the 12th, they submitted a firm request to the Executive Yuan to resign, and they will not go to the ministry to work starting on the 13th. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) During the Executive Yuan meeting on the 12th, Minister of Justice Luo Wen'gan reported on the issue of bail for medical treatment for the Noulens, and visited Cai Yuanpei yesterday to discuss it for a long time. Luo Wen'gan issued a statement, first stating the reasons for the delay in handling the Noulens case, and then stated that hunger strikes and coercion are not common in China. Once this wind is opened, offenders will follow suit, and the law will lose its effectiveness. He also cited the case of the mayor of Cork, Ireland, who died of hunger strike in 1920, but the British government did not change its attitude because of it. Finally, he said that the Noulens have the right to apply for bail under the law, and their representatives now have the intention of providing responsible bail. Whether it is feasible or not is up to the court to decide. If it is considered reasonable, they should enjoy various suspension of detention regulations and be subject to deliberation and approval. (12th Telegram) (Nanjing) Zheng Tianxi said that Minister Luo holds the principle of only knowing to abide by the law and not knowing anything else in the case of the Noulens' hunger strike. If anyone destroys the law, he will fight with his resignation. In 1920, the mayor of Cork, Ireland, was detained by the government for political crimes. He threatened to release him with a hunger strike, but the British government refused. He went on a hunger strike for 74 days and died. Before he died, Labour Party members in the British Parliament questioned who would be responsible if he died of hunger strike. The British Prime Minister replied that the government could never damage its laws because criminals used coercive means. If he died unfortunately, it would be his own fault, and those around him who did not fulfill their responsibility to persuade him, or who encouraged him from the side, should bear the responsibility for indirect homicide. This is almost identical to the situation in this case. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Luo Wen'gan submitted a report to Wang Jingwei today, opposing foreign lawyers appearing in court to defend the Noulens. Luo said that according to Chinese law, except for the Shanghai Special District Court, all foreign lawyers who enjoy extraterritorial rights are not allowed to appear in court. The foreign lawyers requested by the Noulens are one Italian and one Swiss, both of whom enjoy extraterritorial rights, so they are not allowed to appear in court to defend them. However, they can submit written opinions to the court. As for the transfer of the Noulens to Shanghai for trial, Luo said that the defendant should apply to the court, and applying to the Ministry of Justice and Administration is not in accordance with the procedures. In short, this case should be handled strictly according to the law, but if the defendant is convicted, the government may grant a special amnesty for special reasons. (12th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Court Approves Transfer of Noulens to Shanghai Hospital</h3>
<p>Song Qingling and Cai Yuanpei provide bail</p>
<p>Will be available for questioning at any time</p>
<p>Request to transfer jurisdiction rejected</p>
<p>The Noulens are scheduled to come to Shanghai today</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The issue of transferring the Noulens to Shanghai for medical treatment has been approved by the court after the great efforts of Cai Yuanpei, Song Qingling, and others. However, the hospital must be designated by the Jiangsu High Court, and people must be sent to stay in the hospital for a long time to monitor them. Today, the Noulens' lawyer, Chen Ying, and the Italian lawyer, Piz, went to the detention center to have the Noulens sign the court's approval document for the transfer to Shanghai for medical treatment. Currently, Noulens has been fasting for too long and has turned into a morbid state. He is physically weak and cannot stand up, with red spots on his face and sunken eyes. The Noulens woman's face is also pale, but her spirits seem to be slightly better than Noulens. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Cai Yuanpei and Song Qingling provided bail and issued certificates for the Noulens to be transferred to Shanghai for medical treatment, which was approved by the court for temporary transfer to Shanghai for medical treatment. It was also stipulated that they must live in a hospital within the Chinese boundary. The Noulens have been scheduled to leave the detention center on the 13th and go to Shanghai for medical treatment. According to Cai Yuanpei, the Noulens have been sick for a long time due to fasting, so they are temporarily transferred to Shanghai for medical treatment. If there are any inquiries in the future, they will be available at any time. Someone also visited Song Qingling, who said that this time was to avoid disturbances and did not want the outside world to know about it. Due to various reasons, no statements could be issued. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Song Qingling consulted with Wang Luo and other important figures in Nanjing to rescue the Noulens and returned to Shanghai by night train on the 12th. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Jiangsu High Court has ruled on the Noulens' application to the Jiangsu High Court for transfer of jurisdiction as an erroneous judgment. The main text of the ruling is to reject the application. The reasons are: First, the application for transfer should be made to the Supreme Court. The fact that the applicant applied to this court is obviously not in accordance with the procedure. Second, the existence of jurisdiction is a matter for the court to investigate on its own authority, which the defendant cannot investigate. The meaning of Article 5 of the Criminal Procedure Law is very clear. The fact that the applicant applied to this court for a judgment of erroneous jurisdiction and requested that the case be transferred to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court for trial is difficult to be considered reasonable.

At the same time, he internally requested Cai Tingkai to order the Tan Qixiu brigade to open the Beijiang Renhua for joint defense. Cai has agreed, and the Tan brigade will depart for Shaoguan immediately. The merchant ships originally scheduled to transport the Tan brigade will first go to Qiong to transport the Marines to Xiamen. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>

Efforts should be made to improve politics, take responsibility, be廉耻(honorable), seek out local talents, and jointly eliminate the Red bandits. Currently, the bandit situation is rampant, occupying cities and cutting off railways. The government's stationed troops regard this as normal, which is the county magistrate's greatest shame.

<h3>Ministry of Navy Submits a Case to the Executive Yuan Requesting the Prosecution of Gao Youtang</h3>
<p>Divulging Important Cases, Disregarding the Rules of the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Navy submitted a document to the Executive Yuan requesting the prosecution of Gao Youtang, roughly stating that reports say Gao said that the Navy's monthly expenses are millions, but it has never defended the country, and merchant ships along the coast are often robbed, and no plans have been heard to eliminate the rampant pirates. The Marines in Fujian are forcing people to grow opium poppies. What is the use of this kind of army, etc.? In addition to refuting the above, Gao is responsible for important supervision and should not have divulged important cases without authorization and disregarded the rules of the academy. The Executive Yuan is requested to investigate and prosecute him according to the law. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>National University and College Representatives Request Funding Guarantees</h3>
<p>The Authorities Are Currently in Consultation</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Presidents, deans, or representatives of national colleges and universities, including Jiang Menglin, Wang Shijie, Cheng Tianfang, Duan Xipeng, and more than a dozen others, visited Wang at the Executive Yuan yesterday morning regarding the independence of education funds and guarantee issues, requesting: (1) that starting from July, the funding for each college and university must be issued according to the actual amount required; (2) a fixed amount should be set as a guarantee; (3) accumulated arrears should be cleared. Wang received them, and during the Executive Yuan meeting, the presidents of the colleges and universities recommended Jiang Menglin and Wang Shijie to attend and explain the main points of the request. It is understood that apart from the monthly funding of 360,000 for the Pingjin and Zhangzhou colleges and universities, which already has a confirmed solution, the funding for the remaining Wuhan, Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou colleges and universities, which is issued monthly according to the actual amount, will only increase by over 200,000 yuan. Wang, Song, and representatives from various colleges and universities are currently consulting on this matter, and a satisfactory resolution is expected soon. (Special dispatch from the 12th)</p>

<h3>Rectifying Salt Tax in Production Areas</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance Has Decided to Implement in Stages</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to the Ministry of Finance, to rectify the salt tax in production areas, the first phase of rectification will cover the five areas of Liangzhe, Songjiang, Huainan, Huaibei, and Changlu. This is because the salt tax in the above five areas is the lowest, less than half that of the Yangtze River basin. The basic tax rate for these areas was set in 1928 at three yuan per "dan". Last spring, silver prices plummeted, and due to the foreign debt guaranteed by salt tax, a "poundage surcharge" of thirty cents was added to each "dan," making it a total of three yuan and thirty cents. This time, the standard number for rectifying the tax rate is an increase of seventy cents per "dan." Therefore, the total for the five production areas rectified in the first phase is four yuan per "dan." If malpractices can be eliminated and smuggling strictly prohibited after implementation, monthly tax revenue can directly increase by 500,000 yuan. The second phase of rectification is still being planned. As for the salt tax stipulated in the Salt Law at five yuan per "dan," the current tax rate is sometimes insufficient and sometimes excessive. Therefore, averaging the tax rate is a necessary procedure during the transition period of implementing the new Salt Law. (Special dispatch from the 12th)</p>

<h3>Song Ziwen Denies Issuing Public Bonds</h3>
<p>Unable to Further Increase the Burden on the People</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Song Ziwen told a reporter from a certain news agency that rumors circulating that the central government, unable to reduce expenditure or increase revenue, would issue public bonds to remedy the situation were completely unfounded. However, the military campaign against the communist bandits currently requires substantial funds. A better way to increase revenue to meet urgent needs is being sought in the absence of other options. Several methods have been discussed and agreed upon with President Wang, including rectifying the salt tax. Issuing public bonds is now absolutely impossible. If the burden on the people is further increased, not only would the central government be unwilling to do so, but even I personally would not want to resort to this. Secondly, the abolition of the "tael" and the adoption of the "yuan" has been discussed with President Wang several times, and two principles have been decided upon. We are currently organizing things and will implement it once all plans are ready. (Special dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<h3>The Merging of the Consolidated Tax Bureau and the Stamp Tax and Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Office into the Taxation Administration</h3>
<p>Song Ziwen Said It is the Modernization of Administrative Organization</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At the Executive Yuan meeting on the 12th, Minister of Finance Song Ziwen proposed merging the existing Consolidated Tax Bureau and the Stamp Tax and Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance into the Taxation Administration. The proposal was unanimously approved, and Xie Qi was appointed as the Director of the Taxation Administration. After the meeting, Song told reporters that the highest principles of administration are the simplification of agencies and the reduction of administrative expenses. When I first took office as Minister of Finance, various tax collection agencies of the Ministry of Finance were established like a forest, with numerous titles such as the Flour Special Tax Bureau, the Fishing Tax Bureau, and the Tobacco and Alcohol Special Tax Bureau. The organization was large, and expenses were wasteful. It was most inconsistent with the principles of modern administrative organization. Therefore, after taking office, I immediately sought to reorganize it to build a modern administrative organization. Until recently, the old, intricate agencies within the Ministry of Finance have been gradually merged. Only the Salt Administration, the Customs Administration, the Consolidated Tax Bureau, and the Stamp Tax and Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Office remain. This time, the Consolidated Tax Bureau and the Stamp Tax and Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Office are merged into one Taxation Administration. The intention is based on the advocacy of modernizing administrative organization. This change also proves my general plan for streamlining administration, and its impact is not limited to the expenses and management within one agency. (Special dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<h3>The Government Prepares to Implement a Paper Currency Policy</h3>
<p>Will be Presented at the Financial Conference</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The government will implement a paper currency policy and will present a specific decision when the national financial conference is convened. First, the currency system will be unified, and then other matters will be discussed. Some have advocated issuing 100 million yuan in "Zhiping Public Bonds," with 70% used for national defense construction and 30% for military expenses for suppressing bandits. Others have suggested that since the prohibition of opium has been nominal, opium cannot be banned and instead provides an opportunity for generals and bureaucrats to get rich. It would be better to implement public sales, which would increase government revenue. Still others have advocated implementing a paper currency policy, transferring gold and silver for lending. The authorities believe that the amount of public bonds issued in recent years has been substantial, making them difficult to sell. As for publicly selling opium, for the sake of appearances, they are embarrassed to implement it. The paper currency policy is considered more appropriate. It is planned to first adopt the first abolition of the "tael" and the adoption of the "yuan" as a prelude to unifying the currency system, and then implement the paper currency policy. The second step is to establish a paper currency issuing bureau to manage the matter. This paper currency will circulate in markets, replacing silver coins. It will be presented first at the national financial conference. (Special dispatch from the 12th)</p>

<h3>Military Expenses for Suppressing Bandits Have Now Been Decided to be Increased</h3>

<p>(Nanjing) After He Yingqin and Song Ziwen negotiated several times in Nanjing and Shanghai on the funding for suppressing bandits, it has now been fully decided to temporarily increase it by 1.5 million yuan per month, bringing the total to 14.5 million yuan, including the original 13 million yuan. The funds will be temporarily allocated to the troops suppressing bandits, with each division receiving approximately 20,000 yuan. It is heard that the Quartermaster Department has been ordered to draft a budget for the distribution of each army and submit it for review. It is said that the distribution will begin in August. In addition, the monthly party and government expenses were originally 4 million yuan. After being reduced, all parties have felt difficulties.

<h3>The Investigation Team Meets with the Japanese Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>The Content of the Conversation Was Not Disclosed</p>
<p>Japanese University Students Petition the Investigation Team</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, December 12th: Lord Lytton has recovered from his illness and participated in the investigation team's talk with Japanese Foreign Minister Uchida today. The details of the conversation have not been disclosed. The talks will continue on the 14th. Before today's meeting, representatives of the Student Patriotic Federation, organized by twelve universities, visited the investigation team and presented a petition signed by ten thousand students, asking the investigation team to judge fairly so that the disputes between China and Japan can be resolved.</p>
<p>Japan United Press, Tokyo, December 12th: The League of Nations Investigation Team held its first official meeting with Foreign Minister Uchida at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 3:00 pm today. The two sides exchanged opinions centering on the issue of Japan's recognition of the Manchurian puppet state. However, the content was kept strictly confidential. It was decided to continue the second meeting at 10:30 am on the 14th, and the meeting ended at 4:20 pm. It is reported that Foreign Minister Uchida frankly stated that Japan's policy toward Manchuria will not change, and he emphasized the following points: (1) The Imperial Government firmly believes that the solution to the Manchurian issue must be based on the following principles: (1) The solution must be of a permanent nature (2) It must have the effect of eliminating all future troubles in Manchuria. The Japanese government refuses any intermediate solution that is not based on these two principles.</p>
<p>(1) The Japanese government's recognition of the establishment of the Manchurian state. Since there is a fact of establishment, regarding it as an independent country is the freedom of the Imperial Government. Therefore, it plans to recognize it in the shortest possible time to establish lasting peace in the Far East.</p>
<p>(1) The Japanese government cannot believe that recognizing the Manchurian state violates</p>
<p>(1) The Japanese government clearly stated that it has no intention of annexing Manchuria.</p>
<p>(1) The Manchurian country has already been established, and there is no need to directly negotiate the Manchurian issue with the Chinese government. In short, the Manchurian issue is a major issue related to the survival rights of the Japanese people. The Japanese government finds it difficult to agree with any solution that does not recognize this fact.</p>
<h3>Jiang Zuobin Has a Sincere Conversation with Uchida</h3>

Minister of Colonial Affairs Nagai summoned Vice Minister Tsutsumi last night to discuss the issue of the President of the South Manchuria Railway, saying that the military had expressed opposition to recommending Nakaji Kajiwara.

As a result, Minister of Colonial Affairs Nagai adopted a cautious attitude, entrusting Prime Minister Saito with the issue of the President of the South Manchuria Railway for postponement.</p>
<h3>The Belgian Labor Strike is Serious</h3>
<p>A General Strike is Inevitable</p>
<p>The Army Suppresses with Force as if Facing a Major Enemy</p>
<p>National News Agency, Brussels, December 12th: In the current situation in Belgium, a general strike seems inevitable. The Executive Committee of the Trade Union Federation and the Political Committee of the Socialist Party held a joint meeting late last night and decided to recommend to the General Committee of the Socialist Party to announce a general strike no matter what. This matter will be finally decided today. At this time, the situation in Charleroi is becoming more and more serious. Hundreds of workers marched in the streets in teams, and the army was repeatedly called upon to use bayonets to disperse the marches. All major roads leading to towns are patrolled by armored vehicles and machine gun teams. So far, 150 striking workers have been arrested.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Brussels, December 11th: The Belgian government's dispatch of troops to suppress the coal mine workers' strike in the Charleroi and Machienne areas has aroused the anger of workers across the country, causing the strike to expand rapidly at an alarming rate. Today, workers in Machienne set fire to several houses belonging to capitalists and built obstacles in the streets, forcing the infantry to attack with bayonets. They also filled the streets near the base of the strike with broken glass bottles to prevent the cavalry from advancing. Other places in the strike area also followed suit. Barbed wire and obstacles are now spread everywhere. Many workers have occupied factories and mines to confront the army. The government, in order to prevent the troops from sympathizing with the people since the strike areas are all French-speaking, has specially dispatched troops who speak Flemish to suppress them. However, this has further aroused old ethnic hatred and increased the severity of the situation. The strike is spreading more rapidly and has now extended from the southern border to Brabant. It is feared that it will spread to Brussels in the near future. Railway workers have threatened to join the strike, and the call for a general strike is also increasing daily. General de Monier, who commands the troops in the Charleroi area, has not yet announced martial law, apparently because the cabinet does not want to escalate the situation and has instructed the general to be cautious.</p>
<p>In other news, this afternoon and evening, the situation in the strike area was slightly calmer, but overall, there was no significant progress. Railway workers in central Belgium have passed a resolution approving a sympathy strike, which will be implemented on Wednesday. The Socialist Party has ordered a general strike throughout Charleroi. The National Miners' Federation has decided to convene a conference to decide on the position of all miners. The government held a cabinet meeting in the afternoon, presided over by the King of Belgium himself. The details are unknown.</p>
<h3>Revolution in Brazil and Peru</h3>

<h3>The Bank for International Settlements Accepts the Lausanne Agreement</h3>
<p>Three Ways to Restore the Economy</p>
<p>Still Insisting on Maintaining the Gold Standard</p>
<p>Reuters, Basel, December 11th: The Board of Directors of the Bank for International Settlements has accepted today the resolutions of the Lausanne Conference and the treaties established as a result. The bank issued a communique on the overall situation, still considering the gold standard to be the best currency standard currently available and the most suitable for facilitating the free movement of world trade. However, it stated that what is needed now is (1) considerable freedom of movement for goods, business, and capital, (2) a satisfactory solution to war debts, and (3) efforts by various countries to restore and maintain domestic economic balance. If the governments of various countries do not deal with the above outstanding issues, it will be impossible to make progress in the scope of currency or achieve a practical restoration of the gold standard.</p>
<h3>The British Authorities Deny Secret Agreements</h3>
<p>Reparations and War Debts are Linked</p>
<p>Taking Joint Action Against the United States</p>
<p>National News Agency, London, December 11th: After the Daily Herald, the organ of the Labour Party, published news yesterday that the United Kingdom, France, and Italy had secret agreements attached to the Lausanne Agreement, many newspapers reprinted it. However, the authorities have formally stated today that it is inaccurate, declaring that there are no secret agreements or understandings between the three countries regarding the final ratification of the Lausanne Agreement.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, December 11th: It has been widely rumored that the European creditor nations on German debt have concluded a secret gentleman's agreement regarding debts to the United States and war debts among themselves, and according to news from the American press, copies have been sent to German Chancellor von Papen, etc. Today, a semi-official statement has been issued here, declaring that the countries in Lausanne may have concluded any agreement, but it has absolutely no connection with Germany, and Germany made it clear at the beginning of the meeting that it absolutely refused to link the Lausanne Agreement with the old Allied war debts to the United States, and absolutely would not allow itself to be drawn into a united front against the United States. Furthermore, the German government has not yet received a copy of such an agreement.</p>
<h3>The United States' War Debt Policy Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, December 11th: It is learned that although European countries have concluded a gentleman's agreement, stating that the solution agreed upon in Lausanne will only take effect after the United States agrees to reduce war debts, the US government's policy on war debts remains unchanged. Government officials regard the fact that the Lausanne Agreement has such an understanding as strange and indicate that the United States cannot make any further concessions at this time, and does not want to discuss debt reduction matters before the presidential election in November.</p>
<h3>British Prime Minister's Report on Conference Proceedings</h3>
<p>London, 12th (Reuters) - Prime Minister MacDonald rose in the House of Commons today to speak about the situation at the Lausanne Conference. The entire House cheered. MacDonald declared that if reparations persisted for a long time, the economy could not fully recover. The results of the Lausanne Conference could resolve the reparations issue because there could be no recovery without Germany regaining its place as a member of the world community. MacDonald continued, referring to the so-called (Gentleman's Agreement) among the powers at the Lausanne Conference regarding the future of war debts, stating that last Friday, German Chancellor von Papen asked if, should the Lausanne Plan fail, he could guarantee another international conference would be convened. He replied, "Of course." Otherwise, we would still rely on the Young Plan. MacDonald further stated that he firmly believed the Lausanne Agreement would not fail, and Great Britain would exert all its efforts to ensure the agreement's success. MacDonald acknowledged that consulting with the United States on an agreement touched on the most sensitive point, but no one had the right to criticize the United States. Although the United States had not explicitly stated it, he believed that no country was more willing to help eliminate difficulties related to the whole world than the United States. The Prime Minister then stated that the Lausanne Conference was only sufficient to eliminate Europe's difficulties, and lastly, he strongly opposed holding another international economic conference in Geneva.</p>
<h3>German Social Democrats Criticize von Papen</h3>
<p>Berlin, 11th (National News Agency) - National Socialist Party leader Hitler, in an election campaign speech today, made another startling statement, claiming that the recently drafted Lausanne Conference treaty, which would obligate the German people to bear 30 billion marks, would be worthless in six months. Hitler directly accused von Papen's government of being a traitorous government, and he was determined not to let it remain outside the law for long. Hitler further reviled the current ruling officials as traitors and sellouts, while the National Socialist Party was the only party of true Germans. The National Socialist Party was determined not to mix with other parties or surrender to them but hoped to save the people from disappointment and division and build a glorious nation. Former President of the Deutsche Bank, Schacht, who was the German representative at the Young Plan conference, although expressing sympathy for the National Socialist Party, today issued a statement welcoming the Lausanne Agreement. The organ of German National People's Party leader Hugenberg expressed fear regarding the rumored secret Franco-British agreement, fearing that if the United States and European debtor nations could not reach a compromise on war debts in the future, the Lausanne Agreement would be unlikely to be ratified, and the Young Plan would remain in effect.</p>
<h3>French Parliament Trusts Current Government</h3>
<p>Paris, 12th (Reuters) - After returning from participating in the Lausanne reparations conference, Premier Herriot tested the support of the Chamber of Deputies for the first time today. The Chamber expressed confidence in the Premier when Socialist Party members proposed an amendment to the military service law in the budget bill. Herriot opposed the amendment and treated it as a motion of confidence. Subsequently, the deputies passed the motion of confidence with 360 votes against 179 votes.</p>
<h3>Agenda for the British Imperial Economic Conference</h3>
<p>Ottawa, 12th (Reuters) - According to this morning's newspaper, the agenda for the British Imperial Economic Conference is roughly as follows: (1) General commercial issues, and existing or future tariff preferences between the various parts of the British Empire and between the Empire and foreign countries; (2) Financial or fiscal issues, namely considering the relationship between various current monetary systems and considering methods for stabilizing prices and exchange rates; (3) Negotiations between the various parts of the British Empire to conclude commercial treaties.</p>
<p>Ottawa, 11th (Reuters) - The British Imperial Economic Conference will be held here this month. For the sake of greater freedom of trade within the Empire, Canada plans to propose granting duty-free passage to a large number of goods. According to reliable sources, Canada will propose at least 8,000 items. If other parts of the Empire are willing to offer reciprocal treatment, then Canada will waive import duties on these items. The Ottawa Conference will also discuss changing tax regulations to give more preferential treatment to trade between the various parts of the Empire. Delegations from the self-governing Dominions have already begun their journeys, and enthusiastic preparations are underway here to welcome them.</p>

<h3>Shoe King Dies in Plane Crash</h3>
<p>Prague, 12th (National News Agency) - Czechoslovakian shoe king Bata, often called the European Henry Ford, was flying in a German-made plane from Otrokovice in Moravia today due to urgent business matters. However, shortly after leaving the airfield, the plane struck a factory chimney, completely destroying the fuselage. Airfield mechanics rushed to the rescue, but Bata's body had already been torn into four pieces, and the pilot also died instantly. Bata's shoe factory is one of the largest enterprises in Czechoslovakia, employing tens of thousands of workers. The news of Bata's death has shocked the nation.</p>
<h3>Englishman Writes to The Times Advocating Urgent Reform of China</h3>
<p>London, 12th (Reuters) - On June 27, Conservative Party MP Knox suggested in the House of Commons that the situation in the Far East was changing rapidly and that the head of the Foreign Office's Far Eastern Department should be filled by someone with fresh experience and competence in China. Knox also requested that the British Minister to China investigate the general situation in China. The Foreign Secretary replied that he feared he would encounter many difficulties if he granted Knox's request, but he was willing to consider the matter. Today, The Times published a lengthy letter from Young, refuting the Foreign Secretary's words, stating that the work of reforming China should begin as soon as possible. This work would likely take decades rather than years. During the transition period, Manchuria should have a firm and effective government. The unresolved problems in that area currently pose a threat to world peace. Furthermore, Shanghai and other foreign concessions should be managed separately in special ways to build free, effective, and enlightened governments. This is not only for the benefit of foreigners but also because these places are the center of Chinese industrial and commercial life and the only guarantee of governmental authority, preventing complete degeneration. Chamberlain's remarks about returning the concessions early greatly undermine this work. As for the rest of China, although British Minister Lampson has the opportunity to offer considered opinions, it seems that the authorities have not said anything about this, which is truly regrettable. Young's letter concludes by hoping that this matter will not be shelved for a long time, as the Foreign Secretary, Simon's reply suggests.</p>
<h3>Hoover Vetoes Unemployment Relief Bill</h3>
<p>Washington, 11th (National News Agency) - Today, President Hoover vetoed the unemployment relief bill passed by both the Senate and the House of Representatives, and attached a statement denouncing the bill as a dangerous proposal unprecedented in the United States. He strongly criticized private borrowing of public funds, arguing that the bill violated all proper principles of government and public finance.</p>

<h3>Soviet Russian Military Strength Statistics in the Far Eastern Crisis</h3>
<p>The Army and Air Force Hold Supreme Authority</p>
<p>Over Three Million Soldiers Available for General Mobilization</p>
<p>Geneva News - According to reports collected here, Soviet Russian military strength holds supreme authority and is poised to become one of the most important factors in international affairs. At this year's disarmament conference, the Soviet Russian representative officially reported that the Soviet Russian standing army totaled 620,590 men. However, the representative did not specify whether this number included only the permanent Red Army or other troops as well. According to reliable semi-official sources, the Soviet Union has 1,178,000 people who can be mobilized for combat at any time. If the entire country is mobilized, 3.6 million soldiers can be obtained in a matter of weeks. Furthermore, according to the League of Nations' officially published annual report on national armaments, Soviet Russia conscripts 800,000 men each year. The training period is five full years. Among them, 200,000 join the standing Red Army, 200,000 are distributed to local military units, and the remaining 400,000 are inserted into various special military organizations. In addition, students from the Red Army's permanent military schools and semi-military special groups, such as the political police and Red Guards, are all included in the overall calculation. The size of the force is the largest in Europe, and the abundance of armaments is unmatched by other countries. The Red Army's Five-Year Plan projects that by 1935, the air force will have 5,000 aircraft, distributed among 62 air force regiments. News from the disarmament conference indicates that Soviet Russia currently has 2,000 aircraft. In addition, it is making large purchases of air force equipment from Italy, Czechoslovakia, and the Netherlands, worth over 10 million yuan. According to the Five-Year Military Plan, this year (1932), Soviet Russia's air force expansion should average 100 aircraft added each month. As for the Red Army soldiers' morale and technical skill, European military experts are full of praise. The excellence of the armaments is no less than that of any strong nation in the world. In general, a Red Army regiment has 2,867 rifles, 55 machine guns, 54 machine gun carriages, 6 field guns, and 6 heavy guns. Over the past two years, Soviet Russia has ordered 429 armored vehicles from Britain and Italy and purchased many aircraft parts from Germany and Sweden. Furthermore, according to Soviet Russian conscription laws, healthy young people, both men and women, between the ages of 19 and 20 must undergo preliminary military training for two months. After that, the term of service in the regular army is five years for those serving in the infantry, artillery, cavalry, or armored forces, with two years being continuous. In the air force, three years must be continuous, and in the navy, four years must be continuous. The 1932 Moscow military budget is 1,396,500,000 rubles, an increase of 271,500,000 rubles compared to 1931. Assuming that each ruble has a purchasing power of 50 cents in US dollars, the military expenditures of Russia and the United States are comparable. As for the navy, Russia cannot compare with the major naval powers, but Soviet Russia has 4 cruisers, 5 battleships, 24 destroyers, 13 submarines, and more than 10 other warships, all concentrated in the Black Sea, where they have created an overwhelming force.

<h3>Soviet Russian Troops Mobilize</h3>
<p>Actively Preparing for War</p>
<p>Elite Troops Assembled in the Far East</p>
<p>Tension in Northern Manchuria</p>
<p>Tokyo's "Hochi Shimbun" reports that recent Soviet Russian military actions towards Manchuria have become tense again, and rear defense preparations have gradually become concrete. Therefore, the rumor of war between Japan and Russia has revived. According to Russian reports, the total Soviet Russian force on the Russian-Manchurian border reaches 300,000 men, under the command of the Far Eastern Command in Irkutsk. Division headquarters have been established in five locations: Dauria, Vladivostok, Nikolaevsk, Khabarovsk, and Arkhara. Furthermore, naval and air bases have been established in Chita, Khabarovsk, and Irkutsk. Recently, large airfields in the vicinity of Voevodslava near the Korfovskaya Railway between Nikolaevsk and Pokranichny, Spasskoye, and Iman, as well as along the Russian-Korean border in Posiet have been completed, equipped with 150 aircraft. The current deployment of Russian troops in the Far East is as follows: (1) Vladivostok area: the Pacific 1st Division, the 3rd Verkhneudinsk Rifle Regiment, independent cavalry regiment, independent signals regiment, artillery battalion of the 3rd Rifle Regiment, engineering battalion, 1st Provisional Local Division, and students of the 3rd International Infantry School, etc.; (2) Nikolaevsk area: the 1st Chita Rifle Regiment, artillery battalion, 80th Cavalry Regiment, 85th Cavalry Regiment, heavy artillery regiment, independent signals platoon battalion, engineering battalion, etc.; (3) Khabarovsk area: the 2nd Pacific 1st Division, 4th Ussuriysk Rifle Regiment, 6th Khabarovsk Rifle Regiment, artillery battalion, 1st Cavalry Regiment, 2nd Cavalry Regiment, independent cavalry regiment, heavy artillery regiment, railway battalion, engineering company, seaplane squadron, river fleet, etc.; (4) Irkutsk area: the 35th Division, 36th Division, 105th Rifle Regiment, 103rd Rifle Regiment, independent cavalry regiment, independent signals battalion, independent engineering company, artillery regiment, railway regiment, land-based air squadron, armored vehicles, etc., within the Far Eastern Military Headquarters; (5) Dauriya area: the 74th Cavalry Regiment, independent 5th Cavalry Brigade, Buryat Regiment, Mongolian Regiment, independent engineering battalion, armored train, etc.; (6) Blagoveshchensk area: the 5th Heilongjiang Rifle Regiment, artillery battalion, independent signals company, others unknown; (7) Rastorguyevo area: the 2nd Nerchinsk Rifle Regiment, artillery battalion, etc.; (8) Chita area: the 35th Division, land-based air squadron; (9) Spasskoye area: the 86th Cavalry Regiment, armored vehicle squadron, 108th Sretensk Rifle Regiment, 107th Pogranichny Rifle Regiment, Abakan artillery regiment, 104th Verkhneudinsk Rifle Regiment, 73rd Nerchinsk Cavalry Regiment, etc. Russia's elite forces have been completely concentrated in the Far East. The strategic focus is on the Manchouli border, the opposite bank of the Heihe River, and the vicinity of Pokranichny. In recent days, the Russian military has concentrated a large force of 200,000 men in the areas of Arkhara, Blagoveshchensk, and Arkhara on the opposite bank of the Heihe River, which has drawn considerable attention from the government authorities.</p>
<p>Tokyo's "Jiji Shimpo" reported that on the 7th, a German Berlin reporter interviewed War Minister Araki. Araki made the following statement on the Russian issue: Japan has no intention of infringing upon the rights and interests of Soviet Russia, nor do Japanese troops intend to enter Soviet Russian territory or instigate White Russians to resist Red Russia. Now, the Soviet Union is concentrating a large army on the border, and some communists are clamoring for Japan to start a war, making relations between the two countries increasingly unfavorable. However, Japan maintains that if Soviet Russia does not attack the Manchurian border, there will be no danger. Therefore, it is hoped that Soviet Russian troops will withdraw and not be influenced by propaganda and instigation.</p>
<h3>Volunteer Army Recaptures Shulan and Wuchang</h3>
<p>Heavy Casualties Suffered by Japanese Troops in the Battle of Xinlitun</p>
<p>Many Japanese Soldiers Desert Due to the Inability to Endure Hard Battles</p>
<p>Suifenhe correspondence: From July 5, the Volunteer Army forces led by Gong Changhai, Feng Zhanhai, and others moved towards Wuchang and Shulan. Gong's main force engaged in fierce battles with Japanese troops in Xinlitun, Yushu, and then concentrated in Shanhetun, south of Wuchang. Feng's forces concentrated in Tuqiaozi (25 li from Xinlitun). Zhao Wenbin's Volunteer Army concentrated along the Lalin River, waiting for an opportunity to strike at the Japanese and the puppet Ji army led by Liu in Wuokeshu. As a result, the Japanese troops did not dare to advance deeply. However, on the 5th, Japanese aircraft reconnoitered the front lines and reported that Gong Changhai's army of 4,000, with the Big Sword Society and Red Spear Society in the rear, was approaching the northern suburbs of Shulan County, only 20 li or so away. The Nakamura unit of the Japanese army in Xinlitun rushed to that area to block them. However, at the same time, Feng Zhanhai's main force of over 3,000 moved from Xiushuidianzi towards the puppet capital of Changchun. The Japanese 14th Division also dispatched troops on the morning of the 6th to deploy defenses along the Jichang Road to Jilin. As for Li Haiching's cavalry force of about 2,000 men, they supported Gong and Feng's armies, protruding between Xiagutai and Tumenling on the Jichang Road. Although they had not yet advanced to the vicinity of the route, Jichang and Jiyuan were already feeling threatened. Furthermore, the Volunteer Army led by Yang Wenlin moved towards Wuchang on the morning of the 5th to divert the Japanese and puppet Ji army forces. Therefore, the Japanese and puppet army's 1st Guard Brigade in Wuokeshu and Yushu County rushed to Wuchang to block them on the afternoon of the 5th. However, the Volunteer Army marched very quickly and, without waiting for the Japanese and puppet armies to arrive, had already captured Shulan and Wuchang.</p>
<p>Recalling the fierce battle of Xinlitun on July 1, the Volunteer Army attacked from three directions. Japanese aircraft dropped bombs from the air, but the Volunteer Army was not afraid and fought fiercely for nine hours. The Japanese Okawa company was completely annihilated. The company commander, Okawa, was stabbed to death by the Red Spear Society. More than 70 soldiers, officers, and non-commissioned officers were captured. As a result, the Japanese were discouraged. It was heard that the Funabashi regiment suffered the greatest losses. An armored vehicle also became stuck in the mud and was destroyed by the Volunteer Army. Afterwards, the Japanese announced that the Red Spear Society fought bare-armed and used iron spears about three chi long, with dozens or hundreds of people in a team. During battle, they shouted killing cries that shook the heavens and the earth. With each killing cry, dozens of warriors leaped forward. Although the Japanese used machine guns to fire upon them, they did not retreat. Therefore, the Japanese who were injured were all stabbed by this kind of weapon. As for the Okawa company, a lieutenant commander named Jin fled back to his unit after being captured by the Volunteer Army. He reported to his unit that the Volunteer Army was organized, currently centered on Feng Zhanhai, with Feng as the commander-in-chief and Gong Changhai as the deputy commander. Yao Bingqian, Zhao Wenbin, and Yang Wenlin each served as brigade commanders and cavalry and infantry commanders. They had already issued grand pronouncements, vowing to seize Hsinking (Changchun) and advance on Jilin. The total number of people who set out this time was estimated to be over 10,000, lacking only ammunition.</p>
<p>The Volunteer Army specializes in fighting away from railway lines, so the Japanese army, despite having sharp weapons and occupied transportation facilities, cannot use them. During the hot nights, they camp in the wilderness, where mosquitoes swarm. The Japanese soldiers cannot endure it. For example, the soldiers of the Funabashi regiment have their faces and bodies stung by mosquitoes, causing many ulcers like morphine needle pricks. Furthermore, due to camping in the wild and inadequate supplies, many suffer from typhus. Most of the soldiers of the 10th Division were recruited from Okayama Prefecture and enlisted in 1930. Half of them are due to be discharged in May and November of this year. Because they are stationed far away, they cannot be discharged and there are rumors of extending their service period. Therefore, many Japanese soldiers are deserting out of disappointment. The Japanese military has already strictly prohibited this, but those who flee still flee. There is news that Li Du's righteous army recaptured Fujin on July 3. When the Japanese army in Harbin heard the news, they originally wanted to send troops, but the 6th, 10th, and 14th Divisions were afraid to send troops far away, so they have not yet set out.

<h3>Situation of Fierce Battles of Jiangxi Bandits Invading Guangdong</h3>
<p>Part of the Communist bandits from Chijiang and Qinglong Fled to Rucheng</p>
<p>Bandits Invading Nanxiong Retreated Slightly, Guangdong Army Still Deployed</p>
<p>Guangzhou correspondence: This time, the Jiangxi bandits invaded southern Jiangxi, plotting to窥Guangdong territory. At that time, the momentum was fierce. Yu Hanmou's Guangdong 1st Army, stationed in southern Jiangxi, temporarily shortened the front line for strategic reasons. The Communist bandits led by Peng Dehuai first captured Nankang, Chijiang, Qinglongxu, and other places. From the 3rd to the 5th of this month, Li Zhenqiu's 1st Division and Zhao Lian's Jiaodaotuan of the 1st Army fought a bloody battle with the bandits before finally driving them back. This battle was the first fierce battle since Yu's army entered Jiangxi. The remaining Communist bandits are now retreating to Xincheng. Yu's various units are currently advancing towards Xincheng. It is heard that the Communist bandits in Xincheng are currently surrounded. In addition, after the Communist bandits in Qinglong were defeated, they planned to flee to Shangyou, but were blocked by Ye Zhao's 2nd Division of Yu's army. Therefore, they fled sideways to Guidong, on the Hunan border, and entered Rucheng, where they are now surrounded by Wang Dongyuan's Hunan army. The Guangdong authorities yesterday added the 1st Regiment of the Jiaodaoshi led by Luo Cequn, dispatching them from the province to defend Renhua and to be vigilant towards Rucheng. After Luo's unit arrived in Renhua, Zhang Wei's Jiaodaotuan of the 2nd Army, newly transferred to Renhua, was ordered to open Nanxiong. As for the Communist bandits led by Mao Zedong, who invaded the Nanxiong area, they fled from Sannan. Earlier, on the 2nd, most of the Fujian border Communist bandits, about 10,000 or more, fled south from Luotang, Junmenling, and Sannan to Xunwu, and approached Anyuan, disturbing in several routes. A unit of over 1,000 men invaded Wangmudu from Hengxi on the morning of the 3rd, and attacked Xinfeng. A unit fled south to Sannan,窥Nanxiong through the intermediate route, which was Mao Zedong's contingent. The contingent that attacked Xinfeng was blocked by Zhang Meixin's 4th Division of the 2nd Army. However, a certain battalion of Wu Jianxiong's regiment of Zhang's unit was actually calculated by the bandits and was surrounded and disarmed. Fortunately, the rest quickly concentrated and were able to defend Xinfeng City. As for the Mao Zedong unit that fled to Guangdong territory, it had advanced to Changpuxu, more than 10 li outside the Xiongcheng City, on the morning of the 3rd. At that time, Chen Zhang's 2nd Independent Brigade of the Guangdong Army happened to arrive. They immediately left the city to advance the剿匪 , and fought fiercely in the eastern suburbs for about two hours. At noon, they克复 Changfubridge. The bandits, with the addition of a large government army增援, retreated to Huangxu, 30 li outside the city. On the afternoon of the 3rd, they fought with Chen's brigade again near Huangxu. Later, Qiu Guixin's regiment of the 3rd Independent Division of Li Hanhun also arrived at the front line and joined the battle. In the afternoon, the bandits' momentum was unsustainable, and the government army克复 Huangxu again. Until the morning of the 4th, Mao's bandits retreated towards eastern Jiangxi. At noon on the 4th, the government army advanced to Changbaxu, 60 li east of Nanxiong. Since the news of the alarm in northern Guangdong, the authorities have transferred the entire 4th Division of the 2nd Army from eastern Jiangxi to the north for days, causing the Guangdong Railway trains to stop carrying passengers for days. It is heard that Luo Xiuli and Wu Junsheng's regiments of the 4th Division had arrived in Shixing on the 4th and immediately开Nanxiong. At 7:00 pm on the 4th, Liu Shunan's regiment of the 2nd Army from eastern Jiangxi had also arrived in Shaoguan and immediately开Nanxiong. Currently, large armies are gathered in the Nanxiong and Shixing areas. In addition to the two divisions and two regiments of the 1st Army in southern Jiangxi and the 5th Division of the 2nd Army, there are two divisions, one brigade, and one regiment on the border, totaling eleven regiments, which are enough to defend the border.

<h3>The Three Provinces Bandit Suppression Headquarters Establishes Party and Government Committees</h3>

<h3>Liang's Troops Concentrated in Hefei</h3>
<p>Taking on the Task of the Third Column of the Right Route of the Bandit Suppression Army</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Liang Guanying's army, stationed in Qingjiangpu, has been reorganized into the Third Column of the Right Route of the Bandit Suppression Army. Liang has been appointed as the commander-in-chief of the Third Column, and ordered to lead the entire team to concentrate in Hefei and Liu'an. Liang's 25th Route Army and 32nd Division have a total of seven brigades, as well as artillery regiments, pistol regiments, special service regiments, and independent regiments. They are now being transported to the front in six echelons. In addition to most of them advancing along the Jinpu and Longhai Railways to Linhuai and Zunlu, another part is going to Wuhu by water and directly to Hefei. The headquarters has been confirmed to be located in Hefei City. All troops are required to concentrate in Hefei by the 20th.

<h3>The Flood on the Grand Canal Rages; Summer Defense Funds Still Not in Place</h3>
<p>A Conversation with the Director of the Grand Canal Engineering Bureau</p>
<p>Yangzhou Correspondence: The banks of the Grand Canal north of the Yangtze River were breached in 27 places last autumn, totaling more than 900 feet. The loss of life and property of the people, and the relief efforts to raise donations, were certainly substantial. The remission of land taxes in the flooded counties and the funding for repairing the dikes cost the public six to seven million or more. This year's summer tides are particularly high. Although the gates of the various dams along the Grand Canal have been opened early, not only can the river water not be discharged, but the tides are backflowing very rapidly. Therefore, the water level of the Grand Canal is rising day by day. Residents along the coast are all terrified, fearing that last autumn's disaster will be repeated this year. Therefore, they are running around calling for help, hoping to prevent it before it happens. Recently, I met Xu Dingkang, the newly appointed director of the Grand Canal Engineering Bureau. According to him, regarding the issue of governing the Grand Canal, he said that recently, because there are no concrete measures for funding, the Grand Canal project is very worrying. Therefore, what needs to be resolved urgently today includes four items: (1) The old and new land tax (about 300,000 yuan per year) should be specially preserved, and cannot be used until the accumulation is sufficient for harbor management and river dredging. (2) The old dikes are now in disrepair and the new works are not solid. According to the summer defense funds in the summer of the tenth year of the Republic of China, 180,000 yuan was still used. This year's summer defense funds will not be enough to overcome this difficult situation unless 200,000 yuan is raised. The provincial government has agreed to spend 50,000 yuan from the old and new land tax to cover the summer defense expenses. This amount is not enough, and it seems inappropriate to use the land tax in the first step. (3) The bureau's operating expenses, as well as the three sections of Jiangdu, Gaobao, Huaip, and Pizhou, together with the radio station, require more than 8,000 yuan per month. This money should be spent from the provincial administrative expenses, and there is no reason to transfer the land tax. (4) There are too few engineering personnel. Without adequate treatment, it is impossible to find suitable talents. The above four items have been submitted to the provincial government for review and approval. This year's water level is no less than last year. If the above cannot be done, then long-term plans will be even more difficult. Although personal sacrifices are made, it will not help the Grand Canal water disaster.</p>

<p>The Worrying Spread of Cholera in Kunshan: Cholera has been prevalent in Kunshan recently, and those who contract the disease die in the evening if they catch it in the morning, which is quite alarming. The speed of its spread is unstoppable. Bacheng Township is the most severely affected area, and those who contract the disease die before they can be treated. Although the epidemic prevention efforts include doctors from various hospitals and doctors and boy scouts sent by the Shanghai War Zone Rehabilitation Committee, who are injecting epidemic prevention shots for all sectors and disinfecting in various places, the epidemic is still spreading. Therefore, dozens of people in the urban area have contracted the disease and died in the past few days. Although there is a proposal to set up an epidemic prevention station, it has not yet been realized. In addition, the weather was hot and humid for the past two days, and the epidemic has become more severe, and the consequences will be disastrous. The Provincial Water Police Capture Two Thieves: The leader of the 12th team of the Kunshan Provincial Water Police, Ge Xiancai, captured two bandits, Wu and Lin, in Luzhajia Port the night before last night. According to their confessions, they previously colluded with Zhang Weijun to rob vegetable boats in the Wusong River. Zhang is now hiding in Zhangjia Village, at the junction of Xiqian and Zhangpu, and there is a rifle hidden there. According to the confession of Captain Ge, he immediately sent the police to arrest Zhang, and a rifle was found in the river in the village. The two bandits confessed without denial after being brought back for interrogation.

The other day, Li went to the home of his neighbor Zhang to play. Seeing that the family members were all working in the fields, leaving only a seven-year-old girl to look after the house, Li's beastly nature broke out and he raped the girl. The girl cried out in great pain, which was noticed by a neighbor. Li immediately fled. His family members have now reported to the public security bureau in charge, requesting legal action.</p>

<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>The Provincial Order to Squeeze Out 50,000 in Rent: The county government of this county previously received an order from the province to collect two months' rent, and limited the payment of half by the end of March, and the remaining half by the end of April. After receiving the order, County Magistrate Chen immediately ordered his subordinates to collect the rent seriously. As a result, 36,000 yuan was collected. At that time, 10,000 yuan was sent to the province to meet the emergency, and the rest was allocated for military use. Later, the Department of Finance repeatedly telegraphed County Magistrate Chen, ordering him to transfer 10,000 yuan from the rent to the provincial security office for expenses. Ke Yuan Xu Guifang, a member of the An Bao Chu, went to Wuxi four times to press the payments. After many efforts by the county government, it was only able to raise 6,500 yuan, which was delivered to Xu Ke Yuan one after the other. At the same time, it ordered the Public Security Bureau to send personnel to various places in the urban and rural areas to step up the collection of the second phase of rent. However, Shu Cai, the director of the treasury, was once again unable to make up for the provincial treasury's odd funds and the security department's urgent need for payment. He issued another order to County Magistrate Chen yesterday to allocate 50,000 yuan from the collected rent to maintain military rations. In addition to informing the county by telegram, Li, the director of the Provincial Security Office, has also sent Director Liang and Ke Yuan Xu to Wuxi to press for payments. The county government now has a sigh of helplessness.</p>

<h3>A Record of Huiberdeng's Failure to Show Strength</h3>
<p>Where is the Glory of the Tennis King?</p>
<p>(London Correspondence) In the Huiberdeng Conference, the failure of the Tennis King, Ke Xian, to Kao Linsi is regarded as a strange thing. The situation of the game is recorded as follows.</p>
<p>On the second day of the Huiberdeng Conference, the sun was setting. This astonishing discovery was that Ke Xian, a champion player, was defeated by Kao Linsi, a former British Taibei player, 6 to 2, 8 to 6, 0 to 6, and 6 to 3. At this time last year, Ke Xian also lost to Xia Bo on the first day of the conference at this first court. This year, he made a comeback, intending to restore the glory of his past in Huiberdeng.</p>
<p>In Kao Linsi, no one regarded him as an opponent of Ke Xian. Therefore, Kao Linsi, a Scotsman, was a doubles player himself.</p>
<p>As soon as the game started, Ke Xian treated him with an indifferent attitude, because he had to use the first set as practice. Kao Linsi then rose steadily, 4 to 1, 5 to 2, and Ke Xian gave up the last game again.</p>
<p>A good show then opened. Ke Xian was very dissatisfied with the linesman. When a ball came, the linesman did not see it and could not decide. The referee decided it. This happened again and again. Ke Xian asked to change it. Bi Xuepo finally left, which was the third game of the second set.</p>
<p>The battle was obviously fierce, and Ke Xian tried his best to win back this second set, but Kao Linsi knew it deeply and continued to make progress.</p>
<p>The servers all won, and Kao took the lead with five to four. At this point, Ke Xian showed his ability to shoot fiercely at both corners with amazing force and won two games in a row. Kao Linsi did not give in and fought back with a cannonball serve, winning a game and hitting twice more. This second set also belonged to Kao Linsi.</p>
<p>The wind and rain filled the court. This shocking news shocked the world. The 6,000 spectators did not expect the great king to be defeated by a doubles player.</p>
<p>In the third set, Ke Xian won two games, and Kao let him go and completely gave up six games to regroup. Kao won first, and Ke also won back. Then, Kao showed his colors, attacking left and right, and slashing fiercely into the depths of the corners. Ke Xian fought to the death and finally lost, three to one, and four to one.</p>
<p>Ke made another desperate battle and won two games. But would Kao Linsi give up?</p>
<p>Kao Linsi broke Ke Xian's serve, an amazing overhead pressure and slash, and Kao won five to three.</p>
<p>In the last game, Ke Xian almost won, but in the third decisive point, Kao Linsi served fiercely and then slashed, and Ke Xian was defeated.</p>
<h3>The Past and Present of the World Games (8)</h3>
<p>(8) A Review of Athletics Competitions at the Past Sessions (Part 1)</p>
<p>The first session was held in 1896 in Athens, the capital of Greece. There were only 12 athletics events. The results were immature and not as good as the current records in China. The track events were only 100 meters, 400 meters, 800 meters, 1,500 meters, and the marathon (according to the marathon, the course is 42 kilometers and 195 meters, which is 26 miles and 385 yards). There was a 110-meter high hurdle but no low hurdle. In terms of field events, in addition to the currently popular ones, only javelin and chain clock were missing. The iron disc result was only 95 feet and 7.5 inches, 100 meters was 12 seconds, 400 meters was 54.2 seconds, and the high hurdle was 17.6 seconds. As a result of the competition, except for the 800 meters and 1,500 meters won by the United Kingdom and the marathon won by Greece, the rest belonged to the United States.</p>
<p>The second session was held in 1900 in Paris, the capital of France. The number of athletics events increased from 12 to 22. The track events ranged from 60 meters to 1,500 meters. The hurdles were divided into 110 meters, 200 meters, and 400 meters, and 2,500 meters and 4,000 meters were added to the jumping beach. Field events added 16-pound chain clock and standing high jump, standing long jump, and standing triple jump. The results have greatly improved, such as the 49.4 seconds of the 400-meter American Dragon, the high and low hurdle of Clasin (USA), and the 167 feet and 4 inches of the chain clock of Flangnagan, etc., all became immortal figures in Yalin Sikhs. As a result of the competition, the United Kingdom won three firsts, France and Hungary each won one first, and the remaining champions belonged to the United States.</p>
<p>The third session: After the United States won two consecutive victories, the interest became more intense. The third session was requested to be held in St. Louis, USA in 1904. The number of American players who joined was very enthusiastic, one because of the local relationship and the other because of the efforts over the years. The results have improved by leaps and bounds. This session can be called an exhibition of the total achievements of the United States alone. Other countries have been defeated by the wind. The athletics program is the same as the second session, except for one item of 4,000-meter jumping beach. American players monopolized the championship of all programs, which can be called one of the most glorious pages in history. Among them, such as La Erfuluosi's 48 feet and 7 inches of 16-pound shot put results, Pulinston's 24 feet of long jump, Flangnagan's re-winning of chain throwing, and Hill Meng's hurdle jumping are still deeply imprinted in the minds of athletes in various countries in recent times. Swimming pool of this World Games</p>
<p>The fourth session: This session was held again in Athens, Greece in 1906. The results have declined greatly. The field events canceled the standing triple jump and chain hammer, and added javelin and five sports trails. In terms of competition, it still returned to the program of the first session. The United States still accounted for the victory, winning a total of eleven championships, followed by the United Kingdom, France, Sweden, and Canada. It was found that this meeting was ten years apart from the first session. The Greek brain committee proposed that it should still follow the ancient Greek method and hold a meeting every four years, which was unanimously resolved.</p>
<p>However, the fifth session has been decided to be held in 1908, which is not convenient to delay.</p>

<h3>Sanbei Shanghai River Vessel</h3>
<p>Wu Xing Ran Aground and Sinks</p>
<p>All Crew and Passengers Fortunately Rescued</p>
<p>This year, merchant ships in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River often have accidents. First, there was the Yibin of Jiejang, and then there was the Wanliu of Taikoo, both of which ran aground and sank. Recently, the Wuxing vessel of the Sanbei Company also ran aground due to accidentally running aground in the middle of its voyage from Chongqing. The Shanghai office is preparing to salvage it. The details obtained from the reporter's investigation are recorded as follows.</p>
<p>The surging water caused the disaster. The Sanbei Company's Shangjiang vessels, which travel between Chongqing and Yichang, include Wuxing and Fuyang. On the 7th of this month, the Wuxing vessel carried cargo and passengers from Chongqing to Yichang. When it reached the 70th area near Yunyang, the place where the former Yibin Wanliu sank, it was on the afternoon of the 8th. Since the water in the Sichuan River has risen recently, the eastward flow is very turbulent. River vessels usually reduce their speed when going downstream to avoid accidents. However, the Wuxing was driven by the turbulent flow, and the hull lost its driving force, so it rushed to the reef with the current. I wanted to</p>
<p>It was too late to save the car, and the hull crashed into the reef. The bottom of the ship broke immediately.</p>
<p>Damage to the machinery. The place where the Wuxing ran aground was in the engine room of the middle compartment. The hull was pierced by the reef, and the river water rushed into the compartment. In an instant, the water depth in the machine room was five or six feet, and the engine was submerged in the water. The boiler went out and could not move. Before long, the first compartment was also damaged by the reef, and water also rushed in, and the hull sank downward. The situation was very dangerous.</p>
<p>Passengers rescued: At the time of the accident, the passengers in the ship were very panicked and went to the deck to escape for their lives. Seeing this situation, the shipowner immediately released a distress signal and pulled the life-saving echo. Fortunately, the Jiahe wheel of Yihua Yanghang passed by upstream and heard the police signal, so it drove to help rescue. The small sampan was sent to rescue all the passengers on the Wuxing wheel and sent them to Yichang to land.</p>
<p>The hull sank: After receiving the telegram about the Wuxing accident, the Shanghai Sanbei Company received a telegram from Ren Yuqing, the director of the Yichang branch, yesterday, saying that after the Wuxing ran aground, the machine room was flooded first, and then the head compartment was flooded. The hull was heavily loaded and flooded again. At first, three-quarters of the ship sank in the river. Now, because the water is turbulent and heavy, the entire ship has sunk into the river. Fortunately, it is搁 on the reef, and although it has sunk, it can still be salvaged.</p>
<p>Salvage in progress: Yesterday, the Shanghai Bureau has sent an urgent telegram to the Yi Branch Bureau, ordering Ren Ziqing to first send a ship to the place where the Wuxing accident occurred nearby, and try to take out the goods and other important items in the ship that can be taken out, and reduce the load on the ship. On the one hand, it also ordered workers and technicians to be sent from Yichang with cement to the location to try to repair the hole in Wuxing. Then, wait for the water to fall shallow before carrying out the salvage procedure. It is found that the ship has a net tonnage of 300 tons and has been sailing on the Sichuan River for about seven years. The estimated value of the ship and cargo is about 400,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>If the Japanese Army in District D Does Not Reply Today, It Will Be Submitted to the Joint Committee Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Yu Hongjun Indicated Yesterday</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Japanese army in District D and the two yarn factories of Gonda Toyoda has no confirmed date for withdrawal. Yu Hongjun, the Chinese member of the Joint Committee, had asked the chairman of the Joint Committee, Ke Yinhan, again in the morning the day before yesterday on the phone to urge the Japanese side to withdraw immediately and notify our side of the withdrawal date, but as of last night, the Japanese side had not yet replied. According to Committee Member Yu, if the Japanese side still does not have a satisfactory reply by tomorrow (i.e., today), our side will request the Joint Committee to convene a general meeting to resolve the matter the day after tomorrow (i.e., tomorrow).</p>
<h3>The Municipal Government's Attitude Towards Labor Disputes</h3>
<p>Hoping for Mutual Understanding</p>
<p>Yu Hongjun, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, announced the Municipal Government's attitude towards labor disputes. He said that the Municipal Government hopes that both labor and management can understand each other and adopt a spirit of coordination and cooperation. If the conditions proposed by the workers are indeed reasonable, the capitalists should also understand the workers' living standards and improve them. If the conditions proposed by the workers are indeed impossible for the facts, it is difficult to force the capitalists to fulfill them. In short, both parties should be calm and not fight for emotional reasons. If the capitalists indeed deprive workers of their livelihood and dismiss them without cause, or the workers deliberately cause trouble, the Municipal Government will handle it fairly.</p>
<h3>Labor Strike in National Medicine Industry Worsens</h3>
<p>Putianle and others have joined the strike</p>
<p>Party and government agencies mediated yesterday</p>
<p>Mediation scheduled to continue this afternoon</p>
<p>The labor strike in the national medicine industry in this city is intensifying. Yesterday, pharmacies such as Putianle joined the strike. There is talk of a general strike on the 17th. The Social Bureau summoned labor and management for talks yesterday, but no concrete solutions were reached. They were only instructed to resolve the issue themselves. The trade association is discussing ways to prevent the strike. The various situations are recorded below:</p>
<p>Putianle and others strike. After the Feng Cunren Tang pharmacy on Sanma Road first went on strike, yesterday, the Putianle pharmacy at the intersection of Yierbei Road and Xiafei Road, and the Wang Tianji pharmacy at the intersection of Xinji Bang Road and Tangshan Road (not yet officially opened), all employees, because the management prevented the organization of a trade union group, after requesting to withdraw the order was ineffective, and expelled the ringleaders from their positions, so on the night before, they unanimously went on strike and reported to the Pharmaceutical Workers' Union for assistance.</p>
<p>The guild is trying to prevent a general strike. The National Medicine Industry Association specially discussed ways to prevent a general strike yesterday and convened an extraordinary emergency executive committee. Committee members Sun Wen'an, Guo Baosheng, Tong Guangfu, Zhuang Meitang, Niu Hegao, Cen Qisheng, Cen Binghuang, Chen Chuxiang, Zhou Qiansheng, Cen Zhiliang, Zhang Meian, Zhang Hongran, Li Kangnian, etc. attended. Chaired by Zhang Meian, it was resolved that: (1) Zhuang Meitang, Cen Zhiliang, Shi Qin Tang, and Niu Hegao will be dispatched as four committee members to represent the association at the mediation meeting of the Social Bureau. (Zhang Meian could not attend due to illness.) (2) Discuss ways to prevent a general strike. It was resolved that many measures should be taken, all adopting absolutely strong and effective methods. However, due to the confidential nature of the matter, it will not be announced for the time being. The association also learned that in the plan for this general strike, there are four pharmacies specially designated as being related to the workers that will still be allowed to operate as usual (two each in the British and French concessions). However, these four stores will allocate 10% of their daily business income to donate to the union's strike fund. This kind of plan seems to be for the convenience of patients buying medicine, but in reality, it is a collusion between labor and management, privately benefiting themselves. In order to clean up the scum in the industry, the association will take extremely severe measures to deal with the treacherous behavior of these four pharmacies in order to counter them. Furthermore, a large group of unemployed workers plans to petition the trade association tomorrow afternoon. It is said that the association has decided not to pay attention to them.</p>
<p>The party and government talks. The Municipal Social Bureau convened the second talk between labor and management at 1:00 PM yesterday. Cen Zhiliang and Zhuang Meitang of the National Medicine Industry Association, Shi Qintang, Fang Qingjian, Zhao Zhenhui, and Yuan Pinzhang of the Pharmaceutical Workers' Union, Wang Manyun, director of the People's Training Section of the Municipal Party Headquarters, and Xu Yefu, the third section chief of the Social Bureau, attended. Chaired by Xu Yefu, the chairman first reported that today's meeting is a continuation of the previous talks. If both parties have any opinions, they can openly state them to each other. However, in the past, labor strikes in the pharmaceutical industry have emerged one after another. At a time when the Communist Party is active, it is hoped that both sides can understand each other and resolve the issue as soon as possible. This is what the government authorities earnestly hope. Now report on the results of the last talks and the agreed-upon methods. Then the labor representatives stated that: (1) Regarding the Feng Cunren Tang issue, the management is now asking private accountant Pan to investigate, which is not appropriate. Please ask your bureau to appoint an accountant to show fairness. (2) Before the labor-management agreement is revised, the management must not arbitrarily violate the agreement. The resolution passed by the industry association a few days ago stated that the union cannot interfere with replacement workers in other venues in the future. According to the union, it has not been resolved by the representative assembly. It can be seen that the replacement worker issue is being manipulated by a few in the union. The management stated that the reason for the Feng Cunren matter is that the employees are very eager for bonuses, so they asked accountant Pan to investigate. In order to quickly resolve the issue before the investigation is completed, each person will temporarily borrow one month's salary. Regarding the replacement worker issue, it should be handled by the management themselves as in the previous talks. As for the method, it can be modified and handled appropriately.</p>
<p>Mediation to continue today. The labor representatives put forward simple methods: (1) Give each person a bonus of three months' salary. Otherwise, please ask your bureau to extract the books and appoint an accountant to check the accounts. (2) The loss fee during the strike period will be paid by the management at 33 yuan per day. (3) The replacement workers will be implemented immediately. If the management can accept the above three points, they can resume work immediately. The management replied: (1) Feng Cunren has not made any money. The request for three months cannot be rashly allowed. (2) The accounts are being checked by accountants Pan and Hu. The labor representatives' request cannot be agreed to. (3) The loss cannot be allowed. (4) The replacement worker issue is an entire decree. Finally, the chairman ordered both parties to negotiate and resolve the issue with each other tonight (that is, yesterday). If it can be resolved, work will resume tomorrow. If the reconciliation fails, mediation will continue tomorrow (that is, today) at 1:00 PM until 7:00 PM before adjourning. However, it is said that labor and management negotiated a reconciliation on their own last night, but there were still no results, so mediation must continue today.</p>
<p>Employees will hold a general meeting. All members of the Pharmaceutical Workers' Union requested the union to convene a general meeting of members to decide on a countermeasure. A reporter from New Sound News met with Fang Qinghe, director of the Pharmaceutical Workers' Union, yesterday.</p>
<p>According to him, it has now been decided to hold a city-wide general meeting of members at the Yaowang Temple in Xiaonanmen at 1:00 PM on the 17th, but whether it will be held on time depends on the decision of the joint meeting of the union group on the 14th.</p>
<h3>French Concession Water and Electricity Workers Petitioned the Municipal Government Yesterday</h3>
<p>The union will hold a members' meeting today</p>
<p>After the strike by the employees of the Mechanical Affairs Department of the French Concession Water and Electricity Company, tram operations have been greatly affected. The company advised the workers to return to work, and the union went to the Municipal Government to petition. The labor unrest has a tendency to expand. Routes 3 and 6 are suspended. Yesterday was the sixth day of the strike. The French Concession tram and bus were greatly affected by the strike. Route 3 from Ximen to Xiaodongmen and Route 6 from Shiliupu to Xujiawan were forced to announce the suspension of operations from yesterday because the vehicles were damaged and there was a lack of repairmen. The remaining tram and bus routes have also reduced the number of vehicles in operation. The company has hired White Russians to replace the repair work since yesterday.</p>
<p>The company advised to return to work. The French Concession Water and Electricity Company issued a notice to all striking employees yesterday: (Notice (translation) Since the workers of this company went on strike on July 7, there has been no indication of returning to work. However, if the workers now return to the factory to work, the company will treat them as usual and continue to employ them, and will do its best to protect the safety of their work. This is hereby notified. By the manager of this company, Bai, July 12, 1</p>
<p>Yesterday, the strike committee petitioned the Municipal Government at 2:00 PM yesterday, according to the methods decided by the talk meeting, dispatching representatives Ji A'er, Fei Jicheng, Gao Yougen, Yu Guixiang, Liu Zhaofa, Yu Baoqi, Chen Adi, Shi Quanfu, Zhu A'gen, etc. to the Municipal Government to petition, requesting a prompt negotiation with the French consul. Secretary-General Yu Hongjun received them and promised to send personnel to negotiate with the French consul again on the 13th to resolve the issue, and advised them to strictly abide by order, not to cause any incidents, and wait for mediation in accordance with the law. Therefore, the representatives felt satisfied and returned.</p>
<p>Today's members' meeting. A reporter from New Sound News met with the chairman of the strike committee yesterday. According to him, all employees went on strike because they were too oppressed by the French capitalists. However, the capitalists' attitude was tough, so the mediation of the party and government agencies was ineffective. The strike committee has now decided to hold a members' meeting at the Xiaoximen Juvenile Propaganda Group at 3:00 PM tomorrow (that is, today) to adopt effective methods. At the same time, they also requested the party and government agencies to send personnel to guide them. During the strike period, they decided to maintain order and wait for mediation in accordance with the law. If they do not achieve their goals, they vowed not to resume work.</p>
<h3>Electric Power Company Explains the Truth About the Labor Unrest</h3>
<p>More than one hundred dismissed workers</p>
<p>Will still be hired when there is an opportunity</p>
<p>The various situations of the labor unrest at the Shanghai Electric Power Company have been repeatedly reported in previous newspapers. However, according to the company, the trend of the labor unrest is not as serious as rumored. The company's acting manager, Hillert, told reporters yesterday that since the autumn of last year, the company had discussed dismissing more than one hundred workers due to poor business. Later, it was predicted that business might recover this spring, and the existing workers would not be enough, so the company retained the work of more than one hundred workers last winter. Unexpectedly, since the Sino-Japanese war in Shanghai, the company's business has not only failed to recover, but has deteriorated. Therefore, in early June of this year, the company implemented the dismissal of more than one hundred workers. However, the company's door is still open. As soon as there is an opportunity, the company will still hire those one hundred workers.</p>
<h3>Conflict Between Workers and Detectives at Anlu Cotton Mill</h3>
<p>However, the factory is in the Chinese territory, and the detectives immediately withdrew</p>
<p>The Anlu Cotton Mill on Yuezhou Road announced its closure after the outbreak of the Shanghai Incident. All 400-odd workers, due to a lack of livelihood, requested the party and government agencies to order the management to start work immediately and maintain meals. The workers suddenly entered the factory the day before yesterday, and the police station sent detectives to expel them, resulting in a conflict. After negotiations with the Third Sub-bureau of the Fifth District, the police withdrew.</p>
<p>The conflict. All the workers of the Anlu Cotton Mill, although the Municipal Social Bureau has mediated repeatedly, but because of the management's tough attitude, there has been no practical solution so far. Although there is temporary maintenance of meal expenses, it is still of no help. The workers, led by the union, entered the factory from the back door (Chinese territory) at 9:00 AM the day before yesterday. The factory reported it immediately to the Huishan Police Station, which sent a large number of Chinese and Western armed detectives to expel them. However, because the factory door was tightly closed, they could not enter. So they forced the workers to open the door at the factory gate, but the workers insisted on not doing so, and used leather belts filled with bleaching powder water to inject the police from the roof. The situation was serious and the order was chaotic.</p>
<p>Police officers negotiate. After receiving the report, the Third Sub-bureau of the Fifth District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, fearing an unfortunate incident, dispatched the chief of the sub-bureau and police officers to the factory. They first entered through the back door of the factory and first advised the workers to stop pouring bleaching powder water. The workers accepted the police officers' advice and stopped immediately. At the same time, they explained to the police station that the factory was indeed in the Chinese territory, and the police station should not interfere in labor disputes across the border. After the police station determined that the factory was indeed in the Chinese territory, it immediately withdrew a large number of Chinese and Western detectives.</p>
<p>Report on the process. The Fourth District Cotton Textile Industry Association specially sent the standing directors of the union to report the process to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Bureau yesterday and requested a prompt convening of mediation to avoid worker unemployment. It is said that in order to avoid the expansion of the labor unrest, the Social Bureau will reconvene mediation in the shortest time to seek an early solution.</p>
<h3>Japan's Foreign Trade in the First Half of This Year</h3>
<p>Imports exceed exports by 267 million yuan</p>
<p>The Japanese Commercial Counselor's Office in China received an official telegram from its home country yesterday stating that Japan's foreign trade in the first half of this year totaled 1,366,000,000 yuan, all calculated in Japanese yen. Exports accounted for 550,000,000 yuan, and imports accounted for 816,000,000 yuan. Exports decreased by 270,000,000 yuan compared with the same period last year. The main reasons are due to China's unprecedented vigorous boycott of Japanese goods, coupled with the global economic downturn, especially the decline of the American economy, as well as the high tariff barriers and import restrictions of most countries. Imports increased by 115,000,000 yuan compared with the same period last year. This is because people generally anticipate that domestic prices will rise after the gold is re-banned and import tariffs will be revised soon, so they have purchased foreign goods one after another. Due to these various reasons, Japan's foreign trade in the first half of the year resulted in an import surplus of 267,000,000 yuan, an increase of 150,000,000 yuan compared with the same period last year.</p>
<p>As for Japan's trade with China, the export value to China in May was 24,000,000 yuan, and the import value was 18,000,000 yuan, resulting in an export surplus of 600,000 yuan. From January to May, exports to China were only 98,000,000 yuan, resulting in an import surplus of 40,000 yuan. However, it was found that the value of Chinese goods exported to Japan in May decreased by 26% in Manchuria, 43% in northern China, 66% in central China, and 54% in southern China. Japanese goods exported to China increased by 50% in Manchuria and 26% in northern China, but decreased by 15% in central China and 70% in southern China.</p>

<h3>Kong Xiangxi Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Scheduled to go abroad for inspection on the 23rd</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Central Committee member Kong Xiangxi returned to his hometown last month to visit his relatives and inspect the sufferings of the people along the way. He returned to Shanghai yesterday and is preparing to go abroad to inspect the industrial conditions of various European and American countries. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Kong at his residence yesterday and recorded his conversation as follows:</p>
<p>Revitalizing industry. Our country has vast land and abundant resources, but the country is weak and the people are poor, and it is on the verge of bankruptcy. The reason is that the domestic industry is underdeveloped, so most of the daily necessities of the people rely on foreign imports, and huge amounts of money flow out, which cannot be counted. Why is industry underdeveloped? It is because the people of the country only know the importance of industry, but are unwilling to personally promote it. Looking at young students, after graduating from school, they enter the political arena, hoping to be promoted and make a fortune, and ignore the industry that strengthens the country and enriches the people, sitting idly by as the country is weak and the people are poor. It is a sigh. I have been in the Ministry of Industry for several years and deeply feel this kind of pain. I sincerely hope that the people of the country will give up their desire to be promoted and make a fortune in the future and devote their lives to the industry. Then there will be a dawn for the future of China's industry.</p>

<p>Date of going abroad. I feel that the domestic industry is in urgent need of revitalization, so I was ordered to inspect the industries of various European and American countries and am happy to travel. The development of industry in various European and American countries can be used as a model for us. I deeply understand that there is no end to learning, so I will concentrate on learning this time to serve as a reference for revitalizing industry after returning to the country. The date of going abroad has been set for the 23rd of this month. It is difficult to predict when I will return to the country. I plan to go to the United States first and then to Europe.</p>
<p>Feelings about going north. Kong also said that this time I returned to my hometown to visit my relatives and saw and heard a lot along the way. Since I returned to the country from the United States in 1928, I have returned to my hometown once, and I returned to my hometown for the second time in 1929. It has been more than three years since I returned to my hometown this time. I feel that the scenery of my hometown is still the same, but the joys and sorrows of the people are very different. The elders all said that the donations and taxes have been extremely heavy in recent years and are unbearable. The banditry in Shandong, Shaanxi, Henan and other provinces has been much more stable than before.</p>
<h3>People in the Northeast Expanded Armed Organization Northeastern National Salvation Army</h3>
<p>Commander-in-chief Zhu Jiqing leads the public to telegraph the whole country</p>
<p>The people of the Northeast have now expanded their armed organization and established the Northeastern National Salvation Army to restore their territory and return our rivers and mountains. Yesterday, Zhu Jiqing, the commander-in-chief of the National Salvation Army who came to Shanghai to negotiate everything, issued a telegram under his lead. Central Party Headquarters, Party Headquarters at all levels, National Government, various legal entities, various mass organizations, various newspapers, and all armed comrades and compatriots throughout the country, all are aware that the three northeastern provinces have fallen for half a year. The Japanese imperialists are showing their territorial ambitions and adopting the old tricks of annexing Korea, buying traitors and building a puppet state. The 30 million compatriots in the eastern provinces are about to be reduced to slaves and animals and cannot extricate themselves. We are worried and cannot sleep. We believe that the plan for today, in addition to expanding the organization of national armed forces, engaging in national self-rescue wars, restoring territory and returning our rivers and mountains, there is no other strategy. The organization (Northeastern National Salvation Army) vows to base itself on this purpose, rise up to kill the enemy, and before the Japanese army has completely withdrawn from the territory, even if there is only one person left, it will be the last to fight. Our entire country's gods of Qing, patriotic enthusiasm, who is not as good as us? Those who are willing to share the same hatred, why not come? This army will be the vanguard. Northeastern National Salvation Army Commander-in-chief Zhu Jiqing and all armed comrades kowtow. In addition, declarations and letters to the elders were also published.</p>
<h3>Youth Dare-to-Die Corps Telegraphs Its Whereabouts</h3>

Chairman Wang of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Bar Association, forwarded to Mr. Wu Maigao, Jian. Our corps originally planned to go to Hei to aid Ma, but recently, Rehe was in emergency, and it was difficult to give up the near for the far. So we joined the Mongolian Border Cavalry Command under Cheng Changkui, which has long been outstanding in the anti-Japanese war in Tongliao, to help kill the enemy. We are now ordered by Cheng to go to Zhendong and other places to negotiate. We know that your public's patriotic heart is hot and respected by everyone. We hope to get your help when we arrive.

They should be able to view it within days. I am very pleased to learn that you have arranged for about thirty people to come together after the twentieth of this month. I respectfully request you to convey to the gentlemen that we will be honored by their presence at that time. Please telegraph the date of departure in advance so that we may welcome you. Also, as we are currently in a period of quarantine, I kindly request you to consult with Dr. Wu Liande to administer preventative injections in Shanghai before boarding the ship, so that they may disembark immediately upon arrival in Qingdao, avoiding inspection delays. This is my reply, respectfully. Shen Honglie bows." Yesterday, Wang specially invited over a dozen leaders from this city at the Bankers' Association, including Yu Qiaqing and Lin Kanghou, who all agreed that they would accept the invitation and go to Qingdao around the twenty-sixth of this month.</p>
<h3>Abolishing Taels and Changing to Yuan: A Problem</h3>
<p>The issue of abolishing taels and changing to yuan has been widely discussed recently. This is indeed a pressing issue for reforming China's monetary system, with significant implications for improving finance. Moreover, it directly affects all businesses and individuals nationwide. Recently, individuals have been conducting in-depth research on this issue and expressing their opinions daily. This newspaper, sparing no effort, has once again interviewed experts to gradually disclose any findings, aiming to elaborate further and provide references for those concerned about this issue.</p>
<p>Today's publication features the views of a certain gentleman in the financial sector. He has served in the financial industry for twenty years, known for his stable business management. Moreover, he dedicates his leisure time to research and has published works based on his experience, which have been praised by readers. He is indeed a businessman and scholar combined. Perhaps readers may also examine his views. The gentleman said:</p>
<p>The people of the nation have long hoped for the abolishment of taels and the adoption of yuan. Summarizing its benefits and simplicity, there are several points: (1) Merchants and private individuals only need to use one type of currency, the silver yuan, eliminating the need for two sets of accounts. (2) The financial industry also only needs to use one type of currency, the silver yuan, eliminating the need for two sets of accounts and two types of reserves. (3) Merchants who import using taels and sell using yuan often suffer losses due to the exchange rate differences between taels and yuan. Abolishing taels can eliminate this type of loss. (4) Various losses from conversion of silver taels and remittances between regions can be avoided. In the past ten years or so, abolishing taels and adopting yuan has become an inevitable trend. In the past, Shanghai mostly used taels as its standard. Qian Zhuang (money shops) used to only accept silver taels for deposits, but in recent years, qian zhuang have also started accepting silver yuan. Moreover, not only did the number of silver yuan deposits in banks suddenly exceed silver tael deposits, but the silver yuan deposits in qian zhuang also exceeded silver tael deposits. Recently, due to the abundance of silver yuan, the exchange rate for foreign silver dollars (yangli) has fallen to six qian and eight fen. Now is truly an excellent opportunity to abolish taels and adopt yuan.</p>
<p>Speaking of the motivation and history behind abolishing taels and adopting yuan, it can be traced back to around 1914 or 1915. At that time, the people of the nation were already enthusiastic about the need to unify the monetary system, especially because foreign banks had great power at the time, issuing a large number of currencies, causing monetary chaos, which was criticized by the people of the nation. Foreign banks used the eagle dollar as their standard. After research, the people of the nation unanimously advocated that the national currency, the silver yuan, must be used as the standard first. Only by first using the national currency, the silver yuan, as the standard, can it be gradually promoted inland, allowing the various silver taels in different regions to transition from complexity to unification, facilitating commerce and benefiting finance. Subsequently, the government implemented the National Currency Regulations, and the circulation of Yuan Shikai's silver dollar (Yuanbi) became increasingly widespread. However, because Yuanbi was low in value and eagle dollars were high, a unified currency system was yet to be achieved. During the May Fourth Movement in 1919, disturbances in various regions affected finance. The exchange rate for foreign silver dollars (yangli) in Shanghai rose to eight qian, causing public outrage. The investigation revealed that the amount of eagle dollars held by Chinese and foreign merchants was very small. Therefore, through the efforts of the Bankers' Association and Qianye Gonghui (Money Trade Association), it was agreed to abolish the market price of eagle dollars. Market circulation would only recognize one market price for the national currency, Yuanbi... The currency market price began to be unified. (According to this reporter, foreign banks, even the largest ones on the Bund, held very few eagle dollars, far less than the amount they had issued as reserves. Therefore, at that time, they could only nod in agreement. Song Hanzhang contributed the most effort in liaising with them.) From then until 1927, the Nationalist government was established. The government started minting Sun Yat-sen's silver dollar (Sunbi), and its circulation became increasingly widespread. Yuanbi also decreased. Naturally, Sunbi became the national currency. Now, the number of silver taels stored in Shanghai is decreasing day by day, while the number of silver yuan is increasing. As a result, the exchange rate for foreign silver dollars (yangli) has fallen to six qian and eight fen. (According to this reporter, the reason why there are so many silver yuan stored in Shanghai is that the interior of the country is unstable due to bandits and unrest, so cash has been concentrated in Shanghai. The desolation of the interior can be seen from this.) As a result, the amount of silver yuan melted down in Shanghai every day to make silver ingots is nearly three hundred thousand yuan. The silver melted still flows into foreign banks. At this time, there is an abundance of silver yuan and a shortage of silver taels. The opportunity to abolish taels and adopt yuan, which has been envisioned for more than ten years, has finally arrived.</p>
<p>Speaking of abolishing taels and adopting yuan, once the old system that has been used for a long time is abolished, doubts from some people are unavoidable. Here are a few points to alleviate the doubts:</p>
<p>(1) Customs duties: According to customs calculations, customs duties are calculated in Haiguan taels converted to silver yuan. After abolishing taels and adopting yuan, if the silver yuan amount is compared, and if one Haiguan tael is equivalent to 1.591 silver yuan (according to Zhang Naiyan's assumption of one silver yuan equivalent to seven qian of a regulation silver yuan), the difference is about 3%, which means customs revenue can be increased by 3%. Based on last year's total customs revenue, an additional six million one hundred thousand yuan can be obtained. Based on this extrapolation, even if the future conversion rate is one silver yuan equivalent to 7.05 or 7.06 or 7.1 qian of a regulation silver yuan, customs revenue can still be increased and will not be insufficient.</p>
<p>(2) Foreign exchange: For foreign exchange, as long as an official price is set, in the future, after abolishing taels, it can still be calculated using a fixed exchange rate. For example, if one regulation silver yuan tael is equivalent to a certain number of shillings and pence, in the future, one shilling will be equivalent to a certain number of silver yuan. Calculating silver yuan directly with foreign currency has absolutely no connection to anything else.</p>
<p>(3) Domestic remittance: In fact, silver is not used in various parts of China. Although there are differences between silver taels in different regions, they are all converted into Shanghai regulation silver yuan... Shanghai statutory silver taels are the standard. For example, Suzhou Bao silver and Hankou foreign example silver must also be converted into Shanghai regulation silver yuan in Shanghai. Because there is no silver stored inland, and it is converted into Shanghai regulation silver yuan, then after Shanghai abolishes taels and adopts yuan, it can be directly combined with the national currency. Following Shanghai in using silver yuan will be even more convenient.</p>
<p>(4) Debt and credit: The conversion rate for abolishing taels and adopting yuan has not yet been finalized. It may be 7.05 qian, or 7.06 qian, or 7.1 qian. However, on the day the decision is implemented (according to this reporter, the soonest is August 1st, and the latest is September 1st, but it has not yet been decided), debts and credits will be calculated at that day's rate. When merchants convert silver taels owed to them or to the silver and money shops into silver yuan, it may seem like there will be a loss. However, the silver and money shops must also convert the silver taels deposited by depositors into silver yuan and repay them. The silver and money shops have a lot of silver tael deposits. Therefore, the difference between the conversion of silver taels owed by merchants is not much. The silver and money shops will have no remaining profit to take advantage of.</p>
<p>(5) National currency: Currently, the responsibility for minting coins should be centralized at the Shanghai Mint. When minting coins, it must be absolutely transparent. Central and Western expert technicians should test the fineness. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Bankers' Association, Qianye Gonghui, and even the Foreign Bankers' Association can all supervise. If the results of the testing are announced at any time, then the fineness of the national currency will be excellent, and circulation will be no problem. Currently, the Hangzhou Mint has stopped minting coins, and the Nanjing Mint has no inventory. The Shanghai Mint, under the supervision of the Chinese people, should be able to happily fulfill the task of minting coins. (According to this reporter, there are still one or two mints inland, such as the Anhui coin and Sichuan coin, etc., whose fineness may be insufficient from time to time. Then the government should strictly prohibit the minting of low-quality national coins. If the government cannot prohibit it in a short period of time, then when these types of national coins flow to Shanghai, the Shanghai Mint should test them at any time. Those that do not meet the fineness standards should be prohibited from use and not accepted as a way to resist them. Then these inferior coins will naturally not be able to circulate. This requires the collective effort of the government and the business community.) Moreover, the Shanghai Mint has decided on a free minting policy, stipulating a legal price... Based on the amount of pure silver contained in today's silver yuan, plus the minting fee... In the future, when the financial community needs cash, it can entrust the mint to manufacture at any time. (According to this reporter, the amount of pure silver has a statutory rate, but the minting fee should absolutely not be high. Unifying the monetary system is a major national policy. When the government promotes it, it should not have a profit-seeking mentality and should even add a small subsidy from the national treasury to complete its mission.) (6) Paper currency: After abolishing taels, there is a concern that there may not be enough silver yuan in circulation, so paper currency must be used, leading to doubts about the issuance of paper currency. In fact, paper currencies issued now, such as the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Zhongnan Bank, and Xingye Bank, have all gone through the procedures of inspection and public announcement by the Kai Jian Cha Gong Gao Ju. As for other banks that have not issued currency, the government will no longer grant them the right to issue currency. Therefore, the circulation of paper currency now is very different from the situation before 1927. Before 1927, there was no inspection, so there was a risk of excessive issuance. Now that the silver and money shops have publicly inspected, and the reserves are accurate, there is no possibility of excessive issuance of paper currency, and credit can be maintained. There will be no accidents.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Council Denies Voting on the Extra-Settlement Road Case</h3>
<p>A letter from the Information Office of the Municipal Council to this newspaper states: "To the editor of Shen Bao: The report in today's newspaper that the last special meeting of the Municipal Council Board of Directors passed the principle of returning the roads outside the boundary to China by a vote of seven to six is completely inaccurate. After the adjournment on July 6, the public announcement released by this office stated that the method regarding the extra-settlement road area had been discussed. However, the directors did not immediately commit to signing the document after its completion, because it was generally recognized at the time that a decision could not be made immediately. Therefore, it was only decided that the Commissioner-General of the Municipal Police and the representatives of the Chinese authorities should continue to negotiate so that some points could be clarified and revised. The voting process never happened. We hereby request that you make a statement to correct the record. We are most grateful for your cooperation. Sincerely, The Information Office of the Municipal Council, July 12, 1932."</p>

<h3>French Naval Commander Visits Mayor Wu</h3>
<p>French Far East Fleet Commander Vice Admiral Berthelot, accompanied by a staff member, visited Mayor Wu at the Municipal Government yesterday afternoon at 4:00 p.m., accompanied by French Consul General Mériel and Vice Consul Lareinty de Tholozan. They had a pleasant conversation for 30 minutes before leaving. Mr. Berthelot had been to China once 26 years ago. He departed from France for China at the beginning of June this year, first went to the Yangtze River area for investigation, and arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. It is also known that Mr. Berthelot is scheduled to leave Shanghai this Friday.</p>
<h3>Liang Jingwu Detained by Japanese Troops</h3>
<p>Now Released from the Navy and Returns to Hong Kong</p>
<p>When the 19th Route Army was fighting in Shanghai, Liang Jingwu, the captain of the mine-laying team under Chen Ce of the Guangdong Fleet, volunteered to come to Shanghai with the mine-laying team members and joined the headquarters of the 19th Route Army, willing to assist in the Anti-Japanese War. After arriving in Shanghai, they set off to the Jiangyin area to lay mines to prevent Japanese warships from invading. After completing the work, they returned to Shanghai and resided in the Dongya Hotel. On the evening of April 19, while Liang was resting in the hotel, a traitor, impersonating Ouyang Ju, the former head of the Guangdong Police Department, falsely claimed that Ouyang had made an appointment, tricking him to go outside. At that time, a car was parked outside the hotel gate. Liang went out, got into the car, and went with it. Unexpectedly, he was tricked to the Japanese Marine Corps Headquarters on North Sichuan Road and got out of the car. He was detained by the Japanese army. After Liang went missing, the headquarters of the 19th Route Army and Liang's friends searched everywhere, but there was no whereabouts. However, after Liang was detained by the Japanese, a friend of Liang's was also guarded by the Japanese army. Soon, his friend was released and went out, so Liang entrusted him to communicate with the Shanghai Office of the 19th Route Army and find a way to rescue him. This happened on June 20. At that time, the office immediately sent someone to report to Mayor Wu of the Municipal Government and asked him to negotiate with the Japanese side. After several exchanges, he was finally released. Currently, Mr. Liang has returned to Hong Kong a few days ago. The traitors who act as accomplices are really infuriating.</p>
<h3>Representatives of the Rent Reduction Association</h3>
<p>Petition the City Party Headquarters Again</p>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' Rent Reduction Movement Committee expressed opposition to the standards announced by the Municipal Government, believing that they were not fair. The day before yesterday, they sent representatives to the City Party Headquarters to petition. Because they did not get any results, they returned to the City Party Headquarters to petition, requesting that the Municipal Government retract its order and express specific opinions on the issue of rent reduction in this city. Jiang Huaishu, Executive Committee member and Secretary-General, received them. He said that the City Party Headquarters will forward the requested items to the City Government for review. Then the representatives Yu Hualong and Zhang Yichen restated various points. Jiang replied that from the perspective of the Party Headquarters, the public can forward any opinions to the City Government for consideration. However, the public should also consider the difficulties of the government and the severity of the current situation, and should not take other actions. The representatives said that they would convene a representative assembly to deliberate further, and then left.</p>
<h3>The Rent Reduction Issue in Dexing Lane</h3>
<p>The tenants of the houses in Fuxing Lane, which is connected to the Chinese area at the intersection of Tianzhutang Street and Minguo Road in the French Concession, requested the landlord to waive three months' rent, pay 60% of the rent from May, and return the small rent. The landlord refused and sued in the Second Special District Court on the grounds of unpaid rent. After the court president personally heard the case twice, a judgment has not yet been made, and it was ordered to attempt reconciliation outside the court. At 9:00 a.m. today, the third trial will continue. All tenants especially requested assistance from all sectors in order to achieve the goal of victory. A temporary emergency meeting was held yesterday afternoon at 2:00 p.m. at the Yimiao Teahouse in the city to discuss three countermeasures.</p>

<h3>The Zhongwei Rental Ship Lawsuit</h3>
<p>Hearing to Begin Tomorrow Morning</p>
<p>Chen Shuntong, manager of the Zhongwei Steamship Company, rented the company's Taiping ship to Yu'an Company in December of last year for a monthly rent of 13,500 yuan. There was a contract stating that if war broke out between China and a foreign country and affected the operation, both parties could unconditionally terminate the contract and settle the accounts. When the Sino-Japanese War began, Zhao Yuntai, the manager of Yu'an, suddenly thought that he had encountered the facts within the contract, so he negotiated with Chen to terminate the contract. However, Zhongwei believed that since both parties had not formally declared war in the Anti-Japanese War, it still did not constitute a war act in legal terms, so they refused to terminate the lease. Yu'an then hired three lawyers, Yang Hanzhi, Zhang Jiahui, and Ye Shaoying, to sue Zhongwei and Chen Shuntong in the First Special District Court, requesting a judgment to order the return of all prepaid funds. Zhongwei received the court's notice and also hired a lawyer to file a statement of defense and filed a counterclaim. It is now known that the case has been assigned to Judge Yang Peng by the court. Judge Yang has scheduled a special hearing in the Ninth Tribunal on the morning of the 14th of this month (i.e., tomorrow). At that time, the plaintiff and defendant lawyers will have a fierce debate on whether the January 28 Incident constitutes a war.</p>
<h3>Cavalry Commander of the Northeast Mongolian Border</h3>
<p>Sends Representatives to Shanghai to Beg for Assistance</p>
<p>The Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association to Provide Full Contact</p>
<p>The Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association received a telegram yesterday from Cheng Changkui, cavalry commander of the Northeast Mongolian border, which read: "To the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association: The violent Japanese forcibly occupy the Northeast. Who among our soldiers and civilians is not furious? Changkui defends the border between Liaoning and Mongolia, fighting bloody battles with the Japanese army, resulting in thousands of casualties. Fortunately, the soldiers disregard their own safety and repeatedly thwart the enemy's attacks, without losing an inch of land. Currently, more than 10,000 patriotic men from all over have come to join. There is a shortage of weapons and ammunition, and the land is barren and the people are poor, making it impossible to raise funds. In this hot summer, the soldiers are still wearing cotton fur uniforms. It is pitiful. I have long admired your association's enthusiasm for supporting the Volunteer Army, so I dare to send representatives Huang Zhuang Li (three people) to Shanghai to beg for assistance and report the details of the Anti-Japanese War. I hope that you will give us full contact so that we can achieve our goal of recovering lost territory. Respectfully, Cavalry Commander Cheng Changkui of the Mongolian Border."</p>
<h3>Continued Hearing of the Cao Akun Assassination Case</h3>
<p>Cao Akun, a native of Jiangyin residing at No. 50 Renji Road, Pudong, was shot and killed on the morning of the 22nd of last month at 5:00 a.m. in the assembly hall opened by Ningbo native Sang Dingsheng on the fourth floor of Heliyuan at No. 78 Minguo Road, French Concession, while playing mahjong. On the morning of the same day at 10:00 a.m., detectives from the special agency of the French Concession police arrested a related person, Xu Changyu, in Pudong and sent him to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and investigation. The details have been recorded in previous reports. The police found that Xu was indeed involved and was the lookout at the scene. Yesterday morning, Judge Li Changnian sat in the Criminal First Tribunal to continue the trial. First, Gu Shouxi, the police lawyer, stated the case, saying that the police had investigated and found that the defendant was indeed suspected of murder and was being prosecuted under Article 288 of the Criminal Law for premeditated murder. If the court finds other circumstances, the police can change the articles at any time. Under questioning, the defendant Xu Changyu confessed that he was 22 years old, a native of Ningbo, residing at No. 36 Changxing Lane, Dongchang Road, Pudong, currently unemployed, and acquainted with the fugitive Tang Yuanqing, also known as "Little Taizhou", "Little Dog", "Little Xi", "Wang Wang Jiao", and "A Hu". At 5:00 p.m. on June 27, he met "Little Xi" on the road, who invited him to Room 35 of the Central Hotel in Xiaodongmen, where he saw a Mr. Ma and "Little Taizhou", "Little Dog", "A Hu", etc. "Little Xi" said that they had robbed 4,000 yuan of opium with Cao Akun, but Cao had swallowed it all up, so they wanted to kill him and ordered me to keep track of Cao's whereabouts. Later, I, Lu Aliu, found out that Cao was playing mahjong on the floor of Heliyuan. That night, everyone brought guns and went to wait. Until 5:00 a.m. the next day, Mr. Ma ordered me, "Wang Wang Jiao", "A Hu", and "Little Taizhou" to be the lookout, and Mr. Ma and "Little Dog" went upstairs and shot Cao dead. I was arrested at 10:00 a.m. that day, etc. Cao Dai, the wife of the deceased, reported that there was still a wanted criminal, the defendant's father, Zhou Baoxiang, also known as "Little Baoxiang", who was arrested by the Public Security Bureau after a woman reported the crime in Pudong. She requested that the case be brought up for interrogation. Also, Cao Ziqi, the deceased's cousin, arrived at the case and testified to the deceased's last words. The court verified the confession and ordered the hearing to be adjourned to the 18th, with additional witnesses to be summoned for questioning. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Chen Jianchu's Wife Sues Him for Abandonment</h3>
<p>Chen Jianchu, a Cantonese, runs the Nanshengliang Confectionery and Keming Photo Studio in Shanghai. He currently lives with his two concubines, Chen Daxi and Tan Aping, at No. 293 Renzhi Lane, North Sichuan Road. His wife, Chen Lianglianyou, lives elsewhere with her adopted daughter, Yuying. Since the January 28 Incident, when Chen's entire family fled, Chen Jianchu took the opportunity to abandon Liang and her daughter. She sued him for abandonment in the First Special District Court. After the trial, the court found that the plaintiff's reasons were insufficient and dismissed the case. As for alimony, she was instructed to file a separate lawsuit in the civil court. She has now hired lawyer Xi Yafu to sue Chen for alimony, requesting a judgment ordering the defendant to pay alimony of 5,995 yuan. She said that she married the defendant at the age of 19 and has been with him for 16 years, helping him greatly with his career. The defendant was originally destitute. Her private savings of more than 2,000 yuan were all spent. After the defendant became rich, he disliked her aging and took many concubines, listening to their words and treating her like a thorn in his side, repeatedly trying to trick her into leaving. When the January 28 Incident occurred, the defendant only took his two concubines and fled, leaving her and her daughter behind. After the incident was over, he did not allow her to return home. This is malicious abandonment, so she filed a lawsuit, requesting a judgment ordering the defendant to pay her living expenses to avoid starvation. Yesterday morning, Judge Shen of the First Special District Court opened the trial. The defendant did not appear. According to the plaintiff's lawyer, the defendant Chen Jianchu is wealthy and intentionally ignores the plaintiff's life. He was caught selling opium privately by the police, and both concubines were arrested. Later, Chen generously requested 6,000 gold coins to bail them out. His attitude of favoring concubines and suppressing his wife can be seen. Now he avoids appearing in court, which is even more contemptuous of the court. Judge Shen then interrogated Chen Lianglianyou and ordered her to go out and try to reconcile. The hearing was adjourned for further verification.</p>

He replied that he was going shopping and would return soon, so they did not suspect anything. Unexpectedly, Xu left and committed suicide by drowning. In the afternoon, his colleagues did not see Xu return to the restaurant, so they notified Xu's family and asked people to search everywhere, but there was no trace of him.

<h3>Hot Water Bottle Industry Asks All Circles to Identify Domestic Goods</h3>
<p>The Hot Water Bottle Manufacturing Industry Association of this city yesterday issued a letter to citizens from all walks of life (excerpted above): A hot water bottle is a necessity for modern home and travel. Unfortunately, they all come from foreign countries, and enemy goods account for the majority. The huge loss of assets is a concern for those who know. In recent years, although Chinese people have manufactured them, they have not made concrete publicity, so domestic goods and enemy goods cannot be fully distinguished, allowing the rights and interests to flow out, like water flowing into a valley. Since the September 18th Incident, the heat of Chinese people's boycott of goods has reached a boiling point, and the sales of enemy goods have suddenly dried up. After the signing of the Shanghai War Agreement, Japanese merchants returned and secretly planned activities. There are even many unscrupulous merchants who are greedy for profit, risk being scolded, and pass off enemy goods as domestic products, deceiving the Chinese people. Their crimes are punishable, and their flesh is not enough to eat. Our association is a group of manufacturers of pure domestic hot water bottles, and it is our duty to run around and appeal. We hope that all patriotic compatriots will widely introduce them. In the future, domestic products will be popular and enemy goods will disappear. Everything depends on the care and promotion of all circles. As for manufacturing technology, we strive for excellence. We hope that people from all walks of life will not change their original intention of saving the country and carefully identify them.</p>

(6) The Shanghai Lawyers Association sent a letter requesting to recommend a member to review the association’s income and expenditure report for the first half of 2021. It was decided to recommend Committee Member Xi Yushu to review it. (7) Committee Member Bei Zuyi forwarded a letter from the initiators of the Shanghai Library, proposing to organize the Shanghai Library, and requested the association to participate in the initiation. It was decided to list the participation.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Stamp Tax Bureau for Tobacco and Alcohol</h3>
<p>Director Zhang Receives Commendation</p>
<p>It was reported yesterday that Director Zhang Yizhi of the Jiangsu Stamp Tax Bureau for Tobacco and Alcohol received a special order from the Ministry of Finance, which stated: "According to the case presented by the Stamp Tax Office for Tobacco and Alcohol, although many provincial stamp tax bureaus for tobacco and alcohol have been able to remit the full amount of tax revenue to the treasury each month, or even exceed the quota, there are also not a few who use various excuses to remit short amounts or delay payment. Without distinguishing between rewards and punishments, it would be insufficient to encourage them. The Jiangsu Stamp Tax Bureau for Tobacco and Alcohol has been able to remit the full amount of tax revenue in May and June, and even exceed the quota. Therefore, it should be commended." The order also stated: "The sufficiency of the treasury depends on the efforts of the provincial tax bureaus. The director of the bureau is concerned about the national economy and has made every effort to collect taxes, which is commendable. It is hoped that he will continue to work hard to collect taxes and remit them regularly, so as to enrich tax revenue. We have high expectations."</p>

<p>Special Feature</p>
<h3>When Will the Abolition of Taels and Adoption of Yuan Take Place? (3)</h3>
<p>Jiang Lizhao</p>
<p>Of course, we cannot confuse the entire inventory with the cash reserve of banknotes. Then, where are the silver deposits and the silver reserve for private bank notes? According to a report by Mr. Faithfull, the former chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, the number of private bank notes issued by Shanghai money shops and circulating on the market each year is about 200 million taels or more. In Shanghai, which uses silver as its standard, the total amount of trade and deposits is unknown and impossible to calculate. However, its cash reserve, including foreign coins, is only more than 53 million taels, and at most only more than 95 million taels. Is this a paper head or a real head? The money industry issues private bank notes based on the excellent transfer system and unlimited liability credit, and people do not doubt it. Is there a danger of issuing unreserved banknotes after the abolition of taels and the adoption of yuan? It is just a system. The real head and paper head are not worth worrying about. (4) The issue of recording units and the interest of one mill, two mils, and five mils is definitely not the real reason why the money industry opposes the abolition of taels and the adoption of yuan. Changing the accounting unit is just a matter of a hand's turn. The compromise market price is set by the day, and what can be done elsewhere without hindrance, is Shanghai any different? As for the interest of one mill, two mils, and five mils, it has the suspicion of exploitation and should be abolished. Commercial banks in various countries also charge handling fees for commercial transactions. It seems that a fixed handling fee can be charged to compensate for the loss after the abolition of taels. Merchants all avoid harm and seek profit. The money shop business is stable and agile, and it must have its own value of existence. It is determined that it depends on silver for maintenance, so it can be trusted widely and for a long time. Otherwise, if there is exploitation of one mill, two mils, and five mils, why would merchants be happy to deal with them? Therefore, after the abolition of taels, if it is replaced by handling fees, the money industry will still not suffer any loss. If it can be abolished and exempted, then the exploitation is gone, and it will be easier to attract customers. People are the same, and their hearts are the same. The development of business will be even better than it is now, which can be predicted.</p>
<p>The above are still reasons of the past. Since the Shanghai Incident, the foreign bottom in Shanghai and Tianjin has been thicker than ever before. There is a proposal in Tianjin to organize a public treasury to eliminate foreign dollars and finance funds. The Shanghai Lehi has fallen to 6 cents and 8 mils. The reason is that there is little production in the rural areas of the interior, and the use of foreign dollars has suddenly decreased. All the necessities of life depend on foreign goods, which must be purchased with silver. Silver and foreign dollars cannot be used interchangeably. Therefore, the supply of foreign dollars exceeds demand, and the demand for silver exceeds supply. Silver dollars are originally daily currency, but they are useless. There is a saying that looking at white rice makes you hungry. This is what it means. The country is in such a difficult situation, and we still do not plan to alleviate the unnecessary urgency of the financial community. What is the intention?</p>
<p>Since the principle is clear, let us now talk about the method. 1. The government, the financial industry, and the Chamber of Commerce should immediately form a committee to implement the abolition of taels and the adoption of yuan, negotiate the equivalent value of silver in new and old contracts and the existing standard silver ingots in foreign dollars, and the date of implementation, and submit it to the government for promulgation and mandatory implementation. The foreign dollar market in various places will be closed from the date of implementation. 2. Customs duties and land taxes will be collected in silver dollars. The market price of international exchange will be calculated in silver dollars. Domestic exchange rates will be limited to transportation points. 3. Instruments denominated in silver will be prohibited from circulation. Newly incurred silver debts will not be accepted by courts at all levels. 4. The Central Mint should start minting as soon as possible and implement free minting. The original mints in various places must be under its jurisdiction or even closed down to avoid discrepancies and return to unity. A chemical inspection committee will be attached to the mint, which will be jointly formed by the government, the financial industry, and the Chamber of Commerce, and the chemical inspection will be made public. The machines of the factory have arrived early, and the scale is the first in the world. Every 24 hours, it can mint 1 million coins. Shanghai needs 500,000 to 600,000 coins a day, which, combined with the Ninghang factories, is enough to supply the whole country. If it can be implemented, then the credit and supply of silver dollars will be flawless. 5. Provinces and ports must not have local orders prohibiting the export of silver dollars to facilitate their flow. 6. The Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications should cooperate fully with the mint to fully supply the need for silver dollars. 7. From the date of implementation, financial institutions shall not accept silver deposits, nor shall they make silver loans. The bookkeeping of all industries must be in silver dollars. Violators will be fined. 8. After implementation, if it is discovered that there are still Chinese people depositing silver in foreign banks, if there is evidence, they will be severely punished, and the governments should notify the embassies and consulates of various countries to take note of this when implementing it. 9. The original furnace masters, shop assistants, and craftsmen should be sent to the mint for registration and employment, and assigned according to their talents to avoid unemployment. The above methods, the first four items are mostly the original suggestions of Mr. Jin Guobao, and the author has only slightly supplemented them. I hereby declare to avoid the suspicion of plagiarism. I deeply hope that the government and society will implement them as soon as possible. Then, the first step in organizing the currency system will be successful, and there will be a lot of convenience in the financial and fiscal affairs during the national crisis. (End)</p>

Each county should set up schools for farming, animal husbandry, industry, forestry, etc., each county should set up a middle school, and each united prefecture should set up a university.</p>
<p>The people have the right to vote and the right to be elected, but first they should elect local elders as representatives, and appoint two or three young people with professional qualifications as secretaries to the representatives, and have the right to audit and discuss with the representatives of the same prefecture whether the representatives should be approved or rejected. The number of elected representatives in each place is not fixed, so as to avoid the accumulation of bribery and electoral corruption in the election. (The American election is a waste of money. Belgium changed from a republic to a constitutional monarchy, and some say it was to avoid the burden of re-election every three to five years.) As for those who attend the National People's Congress, the number of attendees is limited by drawing lots to avoid endless discussions. Their travel expenses are borne by the state, and their attendance allowance is borne by the local area.</p>
<p>Those who are incompetent can be replaced by drawing lots.</p>

All agency officials must have scientific knowledge if they have full-time duties, and they must be recruited by the agency's scientific examination method, learn the archives of this department, and learn the situation of the states and prefectures for three years before they can receive official salaries and be promoted based on their qualifications. They cannot be removed or demoted without fault. They can retire after one year of service, and still receive half their salary. They can retire according to regulations after the age of sixty. All salaries are accounted for independently, using bank checks and individual receipts to eliminate corruption.

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Research on Amber and Mustard Seeds</h3>
<p>Ma Xiangbo, Ninety-Three-Year-Old Man</p>
<p>Since the publication of the "Original Object" in June 11th, Mr. Cao Zhongyuan first inquired about the origin of "Amber and Mustard Seeds," which was published on June 16th. Then, Mr. Tao Zaidong and Li Mo submitted articles, which have also been published one after another. Now, Mr. Cao Zhongyuan's letter proves that "Amber" is a transliteration and has meaning, so it is specially published. Old Xiang also talked to the reporter about the fact that many gems are from foreign countries, which coincides with what Mr. Cao said. In addition, please send any discussion documents on this issue to Mr. Cao at the Dahua Wireless Electric Company Factory, No. 48-50 Wenlin Road, Shanghai. Han Zhi</p>
<p>The story of amber and mustard seeds. Old Man of Ninety-Three and Mr. Tao Zaidong and Li Zhu have all written a lot of quotations. scattered in this journal. Hong Bo is admirable. However, there are still doubts. Mr. Li quoted Guo Pu's Shantujing Tuzan. The meaning of the text is slightly different from the English translation. If I have already inquired about it from an Englishman. It is not a mistranslation. That is, there is another basis. Lei Zue of the Song Dynasty said, "Amber is like blood. If you rub it with a cloth and heat it, the real one will attract mustard seeds." Li Shizhen must identify it as grass and not mustard seeds. I don't know that amber is heated and rubbed. Everything that is light, dry, thin and small can be absorbed, so Ji Wanlin Yun said, "Amber is heated on the skin. Use a little piece of paper. Keep it an inch away. It will naturally fly up." Lu Fannian was only twelve years old. The talk of crooked needles and rotten mustard is not a true knower of physics. Clouds do not follow earth dragons, and winds do not follow earth tigers. Wang Chong then said that fake dunmou cannot take mustard, and fake magnets cannot attract needles. From the point of view of today's physical experiments, the words of the ancients are all seemingly true but actually false. Examining the book DeAnima by the great Greek philosopher Aristotle, it has been found that amber is a mysterious thing. It is said that its function is the same as that of a magnet. When Aristotle was born. In our country, it was before the Shang Dynasty Wuding. The era was very early. Later, Greek and Roman writers such as Pliny and Thales (one of the seven great Greek thinkers) all have the same records. Calculate the age. Long before Confucius was born. The ancient Persian name for amber was Kuhruba. The meaning is to pick up grass and mustard. The name of magnet is AhangRuba, which means to attract iron. It can be seen that the two things have the same function but different properties. It was discovered early at that time. One is static electricity, the other is magnetism. The properties are different. Not suitable for mixing. What the ancients did not know. It was not until Dr. Gilbert came out in 1600 AD. The name Electricity was first used. It is transformed from the Greek word Hlektron. The meaning is only to explain amber. However, it was late in the season of Emperor Shenzong of the Ming Dynasty in our country. This is the merit of Westerners' creation. Yu explores the allusions. Contains two meanings. One is as Mr. Li pointed out. The second is when and who got this invention by the friction method. If this meaning is not clear, the confusion will not be resolved. After the Ming Dynasty, electricity was referred to as magnetism. The sight of Zhongxi Longdong. For thousands of years. It belongs to another matter again. The scientific deeds of our country. Records are often brief. Like a tree being drilled with grass. History books always end with three or five words. It is speculated that the story of picking up mustard seeds may not be in the Shang and Zhou dynasties. It was destroyed in the Qin Fire. As a result, there is no way to investigate it. The old things quoted in the previous paragraph of this article are all works after the Tang and Song dynasties. Where does its origin come from? Those who can tell its details. Please teach me.</p>
<h3>Casual Notes from Hangzhou</h3>
<p>— Zhi Zheng</p>
<p>Mr. Zheng Yangsheng, director of the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Transportation Office, went to Hangzhou on official business to inspect road affairs. The reporter accompanied him. He spent a day and a half in Hangzhou. In addition to studying road construction and reform, he also saw and heard many other things worth recording. Therefore, I will describe one or two to leave a trace.</p>
<p>The False National Narrative of the Northeast Returnee In the car, he met a certain gentleman who had just returned from the Northeast. According to the conversation, the situation in the false country was quite funny. Puyi is called the head of state, but in fact he is like a prisoner. No one is allowed to see him without the consent of the Japanese. Chonghou, the former treasurer of Jilin, who was a relative of the royal family, once saw the emperor. The matter was detected by the Japanese and he was detained. Puyi's own bed is also equipped with a radio. Even the conversation between the couple can be heard clearly by the Japanese. His pain can be imagined. Zheng Xiaoxu is called the President of the Executive Yuan, but in fact he is like a puppet. Apart from entrusting his son as a secretary, he cannot directly appoint even a lower-level official. The power is purely in the hands of the Japanese advisers. Zheng's old age is like this, which is also regrettable. When the investigation team was about to arrive in the false country, a notice was suddenly posted one day, saying that a play would be performed somewhere. Not only were the audience not charged tickets, but they were also given two dimes and a steamed bun. The whole city was shocked and rushed to watch it. Who knew that after entering the theater, they were led by the hosts into a room and asked each person to sign their name, address, and occupation in a pre-prepared book. Then they were paid. At that time, they did not know what the intention was. Later, when the investigation team arrived in Shenyang, the Japanese handed over this book and said that all those who signed it had requested the investigation team to recognize the false country. There are many other similar funny stories. In addition, telegrams and letters are all checked. However, those letters and telegrams that they consider to have reactionary tendencies are not detained. They are delivered as usual. Those who receive the telegrams must declare the reasons to the police station within five days to avoid being prosecuted. Otherwise, once the deadline has passed, they will be imprisoned.</p>
<p>The Scorching Heat of Hangzhou After the car passed Jiaxing, the weather gradually became hotter. When we arrived in Hangzhou, it was unbearably hot. It was even worse at night. The lake water was boiling, which made people step back. The ancients said that Hangzhou is surrounded by mountains, like being at the bottom of a cauldron. It is true. In the evening, the colleagues at Hangzhou Station held a public banquet for the director at the railway dormitory, gathering together in an unprecedented grand occasion. Director Zheng gave a speech on the spot, detailing the handling of the January 28th Incident, and encouraging each other to cooperate and help each other. The next morning, the director went to inspect the Moganshan hostel, which was still being planned. I returned in advance, and said with a smile to the people who sent me off, "From now on, I will be free from the sea of heat." We all laughed together.</p>
<h3>Yangmei</h3>
<p>— Holding Buddha</p>
<p>When the plum rain is dripping from the eaves, the Yangmei is on the market again. The trees are beautiful, and the beads are like purple and black jade. We wander in the mountains, which is really mouth-watering. Tang Zhang Bi's poem says: "Yangmei is ripe in the tall forest with rain." This is a real situation. Therefore, although Yangmei is a temperate plant, it is suitable for hot and humid mountainous areas. Its nature is very similar to that of lychee, which is described as "One horse racing with red dust, and the concubine smiled." Our eastern Zhejiang is backed by mountains and faces the sea. The sea products are certainly rich. Bao Mingyuan said in his letter to his sister that there are all kinds of hog heads, elephant trunks, mang beards, needle tails, stone crabs, soil clams, swallows, and sparrow clams, and folded armor, curved teeth, reverse scales, and reversed tongues. There are also mountain products, such as Yangmei, which can be compared with loquat, lychee, and forest oranges. The Natural History says: "There is a chapter name in the land, then Yangmei will grow." For example, Cixi, anciently known as Gouzhang, so it produces a lot of Yangmei. Especially the Yangmei produced in the west, called "Bodhi Seed," has small cores and a sweet taste, and is especially famous. In addition, Shangyu in Zhejiang and Dongting in Jiangsu also produce Yangmei. There is also a kind of white Yangmei, which is lighter in color than the ordinary one and has a very sweet taste. It is said that there is Yangmei Wuwu in Hangzhou. There is an old woman named Jin in Wuwu. Because the Yangmei she grows is very good, "Yangmei Wuwu" and "Jin Po Yangmei" have become famous. Dongpo's Notes says: "There are hundreds of moon galleries in Fantian Temple, and there are many Yangmei in front of the court." What he said in his poem: "Dreaming around Wushan Queyue Gallery, Yangmei Lu oranges feel fragrant." refers to this matter.</p>
<p>There are many Yangmei poems: Dongpo also has a poem that says: "Zhu Chang in the south village and Lu in the north village, white flowers and green leaves do not wither in winter: Yangmei is an evergreen tree, growing in the mountains, and it blooms with yellow and white flowers in spring. Hanging red and purple in the misty rain, Shi Renlychee is a pioneer." Lu Fangweng said: "I have not loved the pile of fire jade, Yangmei is also called fire jade, also called fire fruit. I was surprised to find a black pearl in my chin." Song Zhengping said: "In May, Yangmei is full of the forest. At first, I suspected that one piece was worth a thousand gold: the taste is as heavy as grapes from Hebei, and the color is as deep as lychee from the south." (He also said: "The salt in Yangmei can be removed." Yangmei is rich in fruit acid, which can help digestion in the stomach and intestines, but it is harmful to the tooth magnet, so it is suitable to eat it with salt. Li Bai's poem says: "Yangmei in the jade plate is set up for you, and the Wu salt is as white as snow. Hold the salt and drink the wine, and don't learn from Yi and Qi to be noble." It can be seen that Yangmei has been eaten with salt for a long time. Yang Chengzhai said: "Jade skin is half drunk with red millet, and black halo is slightly dyed with purple bags." These are all good verses about Yangmei.</p>
<h3>Worth Introducing Domestic Factories (4)</h3>
<p>— He Gongxing</p>
<p>(5) Ice-Making Factories</p>
<p>There are about ten ice-making factories in Shanghai. Among those opened by Chinese people, there are three relatively large ones: Guangye in Gaochang Temple and Qialong on Kang Nao Tuo Road.</p>
<p>And Zhihe in Hongkou, etc. Among those opened by foreigners, there are three British-owned ones: Tongmao and Shanghai Maochang, etc., and one Japanese-owned one: Dongfang. Tongmao is particularly large, producing 35 tons of ice per day. The market price is 15 or 16 yuan per ton.</p>
<p>Ice-making machines are also called refrigerating machines. Smaller ones cost four to five thousand yuan each, while larger ones cost more than ten thousand yuan.</p>
<p>The ice-making time takes about 24 hours. In addition to placing cold water and a small amount of saltwater for isolation, a considerable amount of ammonia is added to the iron pipes next to the machine. This ammonia is an indispensable material for making ice. Ammonia is an American or British product, costing 80 taels of silver per barrel of 100 pounds.</p>
<p>(6) Soda Factories</p>
<p>Soda is a summer beverage. Lemon aids digestion, orange juice strengthens the stomach, sarsaparilla water removes dampness and cleanses the blood, and ginger beer benefits qi and warms the stomach, all of which are beneficial to health. Foreign Zheng Guanghe soda is popular every summer. The industry is characterized by light investment and high profits, and the outflow of profits every year is incalculable. The machinery for making soda includes water-making, sugar-pouring, water-filtering, and bottle-washing equipment. The most difficult aspects are the manufacturing of bottles and the manufacturing of fruit juice. Domestic goods are not suitable for both. It was previously heard that Watson's factory had conducted extensive research on bottles and juice, but still found it difficult to solve. It is hoped that the three types of industrialists mentioned above will conduct mutual research and catch up quickly. Perhaps there will be a chance of success.</p>
<p>The working machinery varies in size and output. Roughly speaking, a water-making machine can produce 1,500 dozen bottles of water per day, and an ice-making machine can produce about 2 tons of ice. Other machines, such as bottle washing machines, filling machines, corking machines, and carbonation machines, are all foreign products.</p>
<p>Among domestic soda factories, Watson's is the largest, having been established for 30 years. In May of the 13th year of the Republic of China, it was taken over by Chinese people. The capital is 300,000 yuan. Last year's business totaled 240,000 yuan. The next largest are Yili, Huisi, and Shesheng, totaling four companies.</p>
<h3>Casual Talk</h3>
<p>— Liusha</p>
<p>Rotten Banknotes: If foreign bank notes issued by foreign banks are old or damaged, the banks often exchange them for new ones. Only Chinese banknotes, once issued, continue to circulate endlessly until the bank collapses. Even if they are moldy, the patterns are blurred, they are as broken as spider webs, and the accumulated dirt is as thick as oilcloth, no one cares. Recently, a medical student accidentally took a banknote and examined it under a microscope and surprisingly discovered more than 36,000 microbes on it. It is said that these microbes are all poisonous and can transmit diseases to people.</p>
<p>Wine and Tobacco: In the world, the country with the most people who drink alcohol is Belgium. There is a wine shop for every thirty-six people. The country with the most opium smokers in the world is China. The people walking on the streets are all thin and pale, and recently they are going to implement a public opium sale.</p>
<p>Africans: People always think that Africans are born black, born black from their mother’s womb. This sounds correct, but it is actually a big mistake. African children are born white, but within a year they turn purple, and then they get darker day by day, until they become completely black by the time they are thirty years old.</p>
<h3>After Watching the Movie "Kind Mother"</h3>
<p>— Jiang Shoubo</p>
<p>Comparing the silent film "(Kind Mother)" by the Star Film Company with the Western film of the same name, the situation is naturally different, but there is one point that I admire the company's success very much, and that is in terms of makeup. Yan Yuexian, she is a plump and fat person, with a lot of meat on her face. Her original appearance is quite youthful and beautiful. Now in the play, she can transform into an old woman with wrinkled skin and white hair. Even her walking, speaking, and every move still maintain her physical condition. It is very difficult.</p>
<p>Gu Meijun, she is skilled in Peking Opera, but since joining Star, she has only appeared once in "(Silver Star Lucky)," which seems a bit awkward. Here, I feel that Meijun has made rapid progress. In court, she pleads for Jia Haiquan, speaking eloquently, with a lively demeanor, very capable of showing Feng Gu's ability. The scene on the riverbank in the countryside has a beautiful scenery, making it the crown of the whole play.</p>
<p>Wang Xianzai's Jia Haiquan is divided into three periods. At first, he is a bad guy, but in prison, he has already repented somewhat. Later, influenced by his virtuous mother and good wife, he also becomes a kind person. Xianzai's performance in these three periods is truly masterful.</p>
<p>Tang Jie's Feng Da, Wang Weixin's Cao Si, and Huang Junpu's village teacher are all mediocre. Huang Junpu's comical performance is based on his naturally strange face, but it is a pity that he has lost a lot of weight now.</p>
<p>As for the overall compilation of the play, Cheng Xiaoqing was able to use his clever mind to direct it, making it very intense and moving. Zhang Shichuan directed it without losing the original meaning, and he was especially able to use small actions to enhance its spirit. When I watch domestic films, I am unwilling to praise too much. I feel quite satisfied with this one "(Kind Mother)."</p>
<h3>Records of Knocking on the Ancient Temple Bell (49)</h3>
<p>— Bu Chu Ting Cao Zhai Fu</p>
<p>Fifty-three</p>
<p>Strangely enough, Mr. Zhu's problem is no longer a problem. These days, no one has mentioned his failing the exam. Even Old Xu himself is in the stick team, enthusiastically drilling. Zhang Bearded doesn't know how he came back and is smoking his opium under the protection of the peasants' armed forces. He is over the age for compulsory military training, so he doesn't have to drill or keep watch. He has actually become the most comfortable person in our village.</p>
<p>Fifty-four</p>
<p>The good day for the start of school 丨March 15丨 arrived. The children, dressed in fresh new clothes, came very early one by one. They seemed as happy as during the New Year. Indeed, this is a new era in their life history. Whether they have already anticipated it themselves, I can only understand if I am reborn as a child.</p>
<p>Regimental Commander Chunsheng issued an order saying that today's first school opening is a major event in the village, and all members must participate in the opening ceremony in full armor. For a time, the rifle team, shotgun team, sword team, knife team, spear team, and stick team, plus the temporary hoe team and sickle team, totaled two hundred people, lined up, blowing drums, and setting off firecrackers, marching around the village to the ancient temple. Mr. Zhu and Battalion Commander Jiang said that such a solemn and majestic school opening had never been seen before. When the people's schools in the city open, they sometimes find a few Boy Scouts to help or hire a military band to boost the atmosphere, but that is just for show. But today, what we have personally seen is that all the children in the village are going to school under the armed protection of their own people. The meaning contained in this is immeasurably rich.</p>

<p>Spot Gold Recovers Three Taels Seven</p>
<p>Rebound After Four Consecutive Days of Declines: Yesterday, the price of spot gold rebounded after falling for many days, showing a slight upward trend. The market was still uncertain, with waves rising and falling, fluctuating by more than eleven taels throughout the day. Finally, it rebounded by more than three taels. Initially, although the silver market rose, the exchange rate continued to shrink, so it opened high. However, the foreign exchange rate rose, especially with the selling pressure from peers, creating a sudden wave, once breaking below 750 taels. Afterwards, the exchange rate improved, and hedging firms and other parties rushed to buy, almost turning the market from weak to good, with a sharp increase of more than ten taels. The market then fluctuated due to divergent views on settlement, making it difficult to predict the trend. Here is a detailed record of the day's situation:</p>
<p>Morning Market Weak, Then Strong: Opening at 755 taels for August, it immediately rose by 1 tael and 7 qian, with large bars rising another 1/8 to 3/16. The public and private telegram prices for silver both rose by 1/4. However, buyers were satisfied after the European market closed, as the exchange rate had fallen sharply by more than 2 fen. Dalian banks and goods entered the market, followed by 6 taels and 1 qian. Later, Zhifeng, Yongtongchun, Hengyu, Yifeng, Yongyongfeng, Fuyu, and Yiyu, Tongchang all put in great effort. Arbitrage houses, such as Suhe and goods, entered and exited. Almost when the US dollar softened, Mitsui came out with October at 30 yuan 125, Maihang came out with September at 1875, and HSBC came out with July English gold at 3125. The bank's buying price for November even reached 18 and a half, so the gold price was at a disadvantage, falling sharply by more than 8 taels, to 47 taels and a half at around 9:20. Suddenly, buyers seemed strong, and the selling pressure eased slightly, so it rebounded by 2 taels to 49 taels and a half. HSBC quoted English and American rises of 25, at 49 taels, but it had no impact, mainly because the domestic market had stabilized. HSBC absorbed July US dollars at 25, then US dollars at 875, plus Hengyu, Fuyu, Yuantai, Futai, Hengbing, Xinghong, Kangyong, and Hengxingyuan Fushun, etc., came in, so it rose by 5 taels, reaching 54 taels at 10:00. Then it fell back a little by 1 and a half taels, but immediately rose again. Yuhe, Richang, Hengyu, Fuyu, Yuanmao, Yongzhifeng, Yongyuanxing, Yongyuanheng, Qianchang, Xiangrunchangyu, etc., followed each other in rushing in, and HSBC had a very good appetite, absorbing July US dollars at 75, then 6875, and then general arbitrageurs came in, so the market price flew up, jumping more than 5 taels, to 58 taels and 8 qian at 11:30. It fluctuated by a few qian to 1 tael in half an hour. Afterwards, Hengxing Yongfeng and scattered long positions took the opportunity to sell, so the price went back 3 taels, to 55 taels and 7 qian at noon. It reached 56 taels and 2 qian at the close, and then rose again to around 7 taels, so the goods were raised by 8 qian.</p>
<p>Afternoon Fluctuates, Uncertain: The market opened at 56 taels and 7 qian in the afternoon, followed by 7 taels and a half. The Dalian banks entered slightly. Then Shanghai absorbed October English gold at 375, Mitsui entered July Citigroup at 75. However, Meifeng came out with September at 875, and Yuanmao Yonghong Kangyong and Yuanheng Yongfeng, etc., dumped, immediately falling by more than 3 taels, to 54 taels and 2 at around 2:30. Not long after, Zhifeng Yongri Yifeng Yong Tongtaichang came in, immediately pulling it up by more than 4 taels, reaching 58 taels and a half near 3:00. Then Yuanheng Hengxing Yuantai Yifeng Yong sold out, immediately falling by 1 tael 56 qian, to 56 taels and 8 qian. It rose by 1 tael to 7 taels and 7 qian at 3:30. Afterwards, sporadic households settled their positions, and the exchange rate was flat, so the price went back to within 57 taels. Suddenly, Xing Shangchang sold at 4:00, but unexpectedly, buyers were waiting and watching, so the firm was eager to sell, voluntarily depreciating the price, reducing it to 56 taels before it could be traded. However, other firms followed suit, continuing to suppress it by another tael, reaching 55 taels at 4:10. Then it rebounded by more than 2 taels, with Daxing Yong dragging it in, until the close at 57 taels and a half, then at 4:30 at 57 taels, the closing price was 3 taels and 7 qian higher than the previous day, a reversal after four consecutive days of declines. After the close, it rose again by 1 tael, to 58 taels. According to the day's maximum price of 58 taels and 8 qian, the minimum price was 47 taels and 5 qian, a difference of 11 taels and 3 qian. The net charge was an additional 7 taels 25.</p>
<p>Quoted Price Suppressed at 63-64 Taels: The quoted price was changed to 821 taels, because the US dollar rose by 25, the calculation suppressed it at 71 taels to 61-62 taels. The subsequent market was 64 taels to 67 taels, then 62 taels, and the result was 63-64 taels, 11 taels less suppressed than the previous day. The registration for July and August was both 56 taels, with a water supplement of 53 taels, and 54 taels in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Busy In and Out of the Market: Trading was very tight on the table. According to statistics, Yuanmao Yong, Yuantai, Hongkang Yong, Futai Heng, Yuanxing Yong, Hongxing Yong, Qianchang Xiang, and Hengchang Yong all entered the market. Shunli, Tongtaichang, Yuankangxiang, Zhifeng Yong, and Yifeng Yong exited. Hengxing, Yuanheng, Yongfeng, and Tongchun all exited. Fuyu, Hengyu, Dadecheng, Richang, Fuxing Yong, and Yuanchun entered and exited briefly, making it very complicated. Exchange rate hedging had a lot of in and out.

<h3>New York Stock Market Situation Improves</h3>
<p>(Report from Meidongyin Company)</p>
<p>On Monday, the New York stock market, although trading volume was only 600,000 shares, the atmosphere was very good. The trend that day was not like the ups and downs of last Saturday, swaying and uncertain. The opening saw a rise, followed by a positive upward trend, reaching the highest price at the close. The important proposals of this Congress are coming to an end, and the closing period is imminent. The White House's proposal to expand financial relief has been passed by the Senate, so business sentiment has improved, and prices have begun to rise. It is also heard that the steel industry has decided to maintain 12% of production to balance supply and demand. In addition, the White House has denied the unemployment relief plan. All of this is enough to encourage the market, so the short sellers are eager to cover, and the market is strengthened. If prices continue to improve, the stock market will have a greater turnaround. The Dow Jones index for the week is attached below:</p>
<p>July 9th July 11th Rise/Fall</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>The Yarn Market Turns Beautiful Again</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market started to fall and then rise, and the situation turned tight and rising. However, American cotton was flat. In fact, the two gangs of Guangdong and Yunnan searched for goods in the factories in July and August, and the amount was very large. The factories had a good mood, so the recent yarn market was firmer. Except for one yarn factory delivering goods, others were in short supply, so the market atmosphere was firm. However, most people think that domestic finance is tight and sell short. However, Rongxinghao's long positions are still safe and sound, so the long and short sides are very strong. In short, judging from the overall situation, it is very ordinary. However, there are too many short sellers, and the inventory of each factory is small, and the market has turned to rise.</p>
<p>The human bid is good. Before the foreign bid market opened, the prices for each month fell by 1, 2, 4 qian due to the weakening of American cotton and the lack of enthusiasm in the market. The market suddenly rebounded in the second and third rounds, and as a result, the prices for each month rose by 4, 5, 6, 7 qian. The market atmosphere was still rising in the afternoon, and the prices for each month rose by 6, 7, 8, 9 qian again. The total number of transactions throughout the day was 27,100 bales. It was found that Jifeng sold 1,150 bales, Yudai 650 bales, Deji 650 bales, Shenji 900 bales, and Yukang bought 1,400 bales, Changfeng 1,650 bales, and Tianlong 600 bales. The closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Human Bid Closing Compared to Previous Day Inventory Number October 1450 Fall 1478,200</p>
<p>July 1433 Fall 15 15,800 November 1451 1382,800</p>
<p>August 1443 55 40,050 December 1453 15 47,450</p>
<p>September 1446 11 60,700 Total 325 550</p>
<p>The Spot Transaction is Ordinary: The spot yarn sales are ordinary. It was found that various gangs bought a total of 550 bales throughout the day, and the market price fell by 5 qian. The Changsha gang bought 40 bales, Guangdong 160 bales, the mainland 24 bales, Ningbo 20 bales, the northern gang 25 bales, Sichuan 200 bales, and Shantou 5 bales, it is said.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Rises After Initial Fall</h3>
<p>The cotton market experienced a morning decline followed by afternoon strength, indicating a firmer trend. However, the American cotton market remained subdued. The market saw a limited supply of new sellers, resulting in a "dry" trading environment. Major short sellers remained inactive. Local cotton merchants showed a slight increase in buying interest. The future of the cotton market will continue to depend on the American cotton market.</p>
<p>The Zheng Standard rose by thirty cash. The Zheng Standard market opened lower due to the downward trend in American and Indian cotton. Market sentiment was weak, with prices falling by twenty to thirty cash across all months. However, prices recovered during the second and third trading sessions, resulting in flat prices overall. The afternoon market tightened, with prices rising by twenty to thirty cash. Total daily trading volume reached 77,400 bales. Sales included: Yu Da 1,500 bales, Da Feng 3,000 bales, Yi Feng 2,800 bales, Rui Da 1,700 bales, and Chang He 2,500 bales. Purchases included: Yu Kang 2,600 bales, Yuan Da 2,300 bales, Chang He 2,300 bales, Da Feng 1,600 bales, and Rong Xing 1,000 bales. Closing prices are listed below:</p>

<h3>Grains: Rice Market Continues to Fall by 20 Cents</h3>
<p>Hu Nan: Approximately fifteen or sixteen boats arrived yesterday from various routes. Port storage is gradually increasing, while retail and door-to-door sales are decreasing. Financial conditions are tight. In addition, the stock of foreign rice continues to grow daily, causing a general decline in confidence. There is some demand for fresh rice. The market for thick japonica rice has also fallen by a few cents. Although the arrival of early and late rice is scarce, prices have also fallen by a few cents.</p>
<p>Xin Zha: The number of boats arriving on the western route yesterday was limited. However, there was still a large influx of Changshu, Xixi, and Jiangyin Yixing rice. Trading in this area is slow, with list prices down by 20 cents. There is some limited demand for early rice from rural villages. The market for foreign Du Jian rice is slow and weak. The market for converted silver dollars is weak due to cloudy weather. Fortunately, inventory is low, so there is little fluctuation in the market.</p>
<h3>Northern Merchant Groups Continue to Purchase Foreign Rice</h3>
<p>There is discussion within the association to maintain prices.</p>
<p>The foreign rice market continued to weaken yesterday. Small-grain rice continued to fall by a few cents. Demand in this area remains slow. However, Northern merchant groups from Tianjin and other ports, considering the repeated declines in the Shanghai market, found it profitable to purchase over 2,000 bags of small-grain rice. Local retailers also purchased a small amount of small-grain rice, in addition to 200 bags of Saigon rice, at prices slightly lower than last week. Overall, 200 bags of Grade 1 Saigon rice were sold at 11 yuan, and 2,700 bags of small-grain rice were sold at 9.40 to 9.80 yuan. The foreign rice inventory is over 1 million bags, with orders for over 500,000 bags still pending. The market is trending downwards, and sentiment is volatile. The Rice Industry Association had discussions yesterday to maintain prices, but no viable solution has been reached.</p>
<h3>Flour Trading Active Before Settlement, Market Firm</h3>
<p>Flour trading will only be conducted during the morning session from July 13th to August 3rd.</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening bell in the flour market, prices for all months showed a fluctuating trend. Foreign wheat prices fell by another one or two cents. However, supply was very limited, and major factories were hesitant to sell, resulting in very quiet trading. Only over 30,000 bags were traded in the morning. Market sentiment improved slightly after the afternoon opening. Trading in the first three sessions was still weak, but the last three sessions saw active trading and a strengthening market. It was rumored that the Tianjin merchant group continued to purchase large quantities of spot goods, with Fu Xin and Fu Feng factories trading a total of 100,000 bags. Tianjin deliveries are still priced at 1 tael, 2 mace, 9 qian, and 1 fen. As a result, sentiment improved, and subsequent sales may continue at current levels, or prices may stabilize. As a result, July prices rose by two cents from the previous day, August prices rose by one cent and two and a half li, September and October prices rose by one cent, and November and December prices rose by one cent and two and a half li. Furthermore, the Flour Exchange, due to the recent hot weather, in accordance with past practice and at the request of all members, decided that from the 13th of this month to the 3rd of August, only the morning session will be held. The afternoon session will be canceled. However, the morning session will be changed to open at 9:30 AM and will include three additional sessions, for a total of six sessions.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market in a Stalemate</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening bell in the wheat market, prices for all months generally showed a fluctuating trend. Foreign wheat prices fell by another one or two cents. Although spot wheat prices are low, factory demand is still strong. As a result, supply is very limited. However, those who wanted to buy were hesitant to try due to the falling prices of foreign wheat, resulting in a stalemate with little movement. As a result, the current month's price rose by one cent from the previous day, June's price fell by one cent, and there were no comparisons for the remaining months. The spot wheat market remained stable, with factory demand still active. Straight Tang wheat was priced at 2 taels, 8 mace, 3 qian, and 4 fen. Changshu wheat was priced at 2 taels, 8 mace, and 7 fen. Kunshan wheat was priced at 2 taels, 7 mace, and 9 fen, with lower grades priced at 7 qian and 5 fen. Bai He Xiang wheat was priced at 2 taels and 7 mace, and 6 fen. Xia Jia Qiao wheat was priced at 2 taels and 8 mace, totaling over 2,000 bags.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea: Zhejiang Double Cocoon Arrivals in Shanghai Unaffected</p>
<p>700 Bales of Cocoons Shipped to Shanghai After Market Opening</p>
<p>This year's spring in Zhejiang Province was mostly double cocoon due to continuous spring rains and cold weather. The Shanghai market is experiencing slow sales of Zhejiang double cocoons, but the quantity shipped to Shanghai has not decreased. Since the new cocoons came on the market, over 700 bales of Zhejiang double cocoons have been shipped to Shanghai. All are held by various banks and warehouses awaiting sale.</p>
<h3>Lu Zhuang Grade Tea Active in European Sales</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign tea market in Shanghai saw British firms such as Jardine Matheson, Ewo, Fooksz, and Tongfook actively purchasing Grade "Zhen Mei" green tea from Tunxi, Wudong, Shexian, Suian, and other areas. Other European firms have also received overseas orders and are preparing to purchase. The Lu Zhuang Grade "Zhen Mei" market has entered an active period. Chinese tea merchants believe that current market conditions for Grade "Zhen Mei" are not only causing significant losses, but it is also impossible to replenish their stocks. Therefore, they are taking a consistently firm stance. According to general tea merchants, the market prices for Zhen Mei, Zhen Mei Needle, Xiu Mei, and Shrimp Eye grades are all expected to rebound. However, the Gongxi grade, which is the white head grade, is not selling well, and Russian firms are only willing to buy at low prices, making it difficult to see any improvement in the situation.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Early Red Lychees on Sale Yesterday</h3>
<p>New Xuzhou Vegetables Sell for 17 Taels</p>
<p>The first batch of early red lychees, totaling twenty-seven boxes, arrived on the Hai Rui vessel the day before yesterday and were on display yesterday. Due to being the first of the season, the fruit was soft and medium-sized. Because of the limited quantity, they sold for 17 taels. However, even at this price, there will still be losses. If subsequent batches arrive in larger quantities, the price may need to be lowered slightly.</p>
<p>Two batches of new Golden Needles have arrived, totaling over thirty small packages of Xuzhou vegetables. The product is quite good after being soaked in water and sold for 16 taels. All were sold by various firms for 17 taels. There is still a large inventory of old goods, making it very difficult to improve the situation. High-grade goods are scarce in the market, with general prices ranging from 12 taels down to 7 or 8 taels.</p>
<h3>Coal: Shanxi Coal Market Prices Plummet</h3>
<p>Sales of all types of white coal have recently declined sharply due to the hot weather and reduced usage. Market trading is exceptionally quiet, causing prices to weaken daily. Sales of Shanxi lump coal are even weaker, and its inventory is larger than other types of coal. As a result, the price has fallen from 19 taels per ton to 16 taels. Many people believe that prices will continue to fall in the future.</p>

<h3>The Truth About Suicide (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Buddhist</p>
<p>Yesterday, I rambled on and on about the truth of suicide. In fact, if my suggestions were implemented, it would definitely reduce the youth's anxiety and the number of suicides. Because I still have more to say, I will add a few more words today.</p>
<p>Economic oppression and love problems are indeed two separate things, but there is a strong causal relationship between them. Because I am someone who has suffered from this experience, I have struggled for decades under the condition of economic oppression, and it is still unresolved. I feel personally and deeply. Now, students in general universities or middle schools also have this trend. Before they have finished their studies, everyone is desperately talking about freedom and love, putting the subjects they should be studying behind them. This is a big mistake and a big misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Do you want to fall in love? Today, I will use two ancient people as examples. Suppose you achieve the goal of love and encounter such a situation, how would you feel and what would you do? It's a dead end. Zhu Maichen of the Han Dynasty was poor and loved to read. He often sold firewood to support himself, reading as he walked. His wife was ashamed and left him. Maichen said, "I will be rich and noble when I am fifty. You have suffered for a long time. When I am rich, I will repay you." His wife said, "If I wait for you to be rich, I will have starved to death long ago." She did not listen and went to marry a farmer.</p>
<p>Also, Wang Zhang of the Han Dynasty, when he was a student, studied in Chang'an and lived alone with his wife. Zhang was sick and had no quilt, lying in a cowhide coat, crying and saying goodbye to his wife. His wife scolded him angrily.</p>
<p>Suppose you marry a modern girl but don't have the ability to make a living and encounter such a situation, would you be painful or not? Can you endure it or not? Not only that, the ancients said, "One person becomes twice as difficult, two people become three times easier." After love, the crystallizations of love, Big Brother, Second Brother, Third Brother... are manufactured one by one from the manufacturing plant, making your burden heavier day by day and your pain deeper day by day. This is truly as Mr. Yu Youren said, "It's hard to get by."</p>
<p>As the children gradually grow up, let them go to school. How can you afford such aristocratic schools? If you don't give them some education, will you teach the crystallization of love to become bandits, hooligans, or bums? Moreover, in this day and age, even if they are good citizens, they are either sent in batches to the enemy's artillery fire or to their own warlord's artillery fire. What is the meaning of creating citizens? Leaving aside this, food, clothing, shelter, and transportation are enough for you to suffer.</p>
<p>Even if your son is raised to be intelligent and successful, becoming an official or a rich man, it is your son and daughter-in-law who are happy. What does it have to do with you, the old man? Suppose you embrace the principle of celibacy. Because of celibacy, life will definitely be less oppressive. Moreover, the celibacy I advocate is not absolute, but relative. Suppose you have the ability to make a living and have a stable job, then you can transform celibacy into dual-personism, which is not impossible. Moreover, the current marriage system is unreliable. As the saying goes, "A farmer who harvests ten more bushels of wheat still wants to change wives." You see, nowadays, those so-called important people, because they have suddenly become officials, either divorce or abandon their former humble wives and pursue a modern girl to fulfill their duties. According to my suggestion, you can also save a divorce procedure. Why be afraid not to do it?</p>
<h3>Sending to Friends in Sorrow</h3>
<p>— Zhou Dayang</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I suddenly received a letter from my friend Zhou Dayang, and when I opened it, it was several drafts of poems. I am submitting them to this journal for the enjoyment of fellow enthusiasts. Zeye adds a note:</p>
<p>What is the matter with a man weeping,</p>
<p>Counting the past is more like a dream,</p>
<p>I pity the lotus picking side by side,</p>
<p>I resent the willow's confusing eyes,</p>
<p>The hidden pain of a thousand years is the same,</p>
<p>The two words heartbreaking is what to do,</p>
<p>A little infatuation, a little tear,</p>
<p>Arrange the sea of ​​hate to brew the waves of love.</p>
<p>I once pawned my sable fur to buy spring,</p>
<p>I kept the affair of roasting my calf nose,</p>
<p>I believe that with intention, hate will eventually be near,</p>
<p>Loving the other half makes it easy to worry,</p>
<p>Disturbing a hundred feelings with wind and rain,</p>
<p>Accompany me with double demons and sickness,</p>
<p>Knowing that the oath of the same hole has been felt,</p>
<p>Difficult to fulfill the wish of the earth and the sky.</p>

<h3>How to Make Cod Liver Oil</h3>
<p>— Yingzhou</p>
<p>Cod liver oil is something that, when taken, can nourish blood and treat the lungs, and its effect is very great. In recent years, it has been sold in the country in large quantities, mostly imported products. The outflow of profits is deeply lamented. According to the raw materials for this oil, which are taken from the livers of croakers (that is, croaker fish), are very abundant in Shidao, Shandong, China. It was originally a waste product discarded by fishermen when they salt-cured croakers. If you want to collect raw materials, you don't need any capital. Therefore, I deeply hope that ambitious entrepreneurs will go to purchase and imitate it, and also revitalize national goods. I will introduce the manufacturing method as follows.</p>
<p>(A) Cooking Method</p>
<p>This method directly puts a large amount of raw materials into a pot, slowly heats and cooks them, the oil that melts out is drawn from the side, and the residue is taken out from time to time, and new raw materials are put in for continuous work. Finally, the residue is pressed to squeeze out the remaining oil. The fuel used in this method must be firewood. If coal is used, the heat will be too intense, and the oil will be colored by scorching. Using firewood can avoid this concern.</p>
<p>(B) Refining Method: There are several methods for this method, and the commonly used ones are listed as follows.</p>
<p>(1) Washing Method The oil obtained contains a large amount of impurities, namely protein, mucus, dust, etc., which generate bad odors and are prone to decay. Therefore, after collecting it, a large amount of water must be added and stirred for washing. After standing, the oil will appear as a transparent layer. This layer is drawn out and then water is added again. This can be repeated several times to obtain transparent oil.</p>
<p>(2) Standing Method The oil is injected into a container and left to stand for a long time. The impurities will settle, and the oil will form a transparent layer. Draw it out to obtain transparent oil. Also, inject the oil into a shallow container and expose it to direct sunlight. Standing for a long time will not cause changes in the oil, but the impurities will be acidified and decomposed, gradually bleaching, which is also effective.</p>
<p>(3) Filtration Method This method is the most common method, that is, the bleached and standing oil is drawn out according to the method described above, and passed through layers of filter paper and charcoal powder. When filtering, more transparent oil can be obtained. Recently, sand and clay are mixed into the oil, heated slightly to absorb odors or impurities, and then filtered again to obtain better results.</p>
<p>(4) Refining Method by Adding Acid When sulfuric acid is added to the oil, the salts become sulfates and dissolve other dirt, which is carbonized and precipitated. Although sulfuric acid has a strong effect on oil, a small amount can have a special refining effect. About 1% is diluted in water of equal volume, added, and heated to a low temperature. If there is dirt precipitation, remove it. The oil is washed with clean water until it does not show an acid reaction.</p>

<h3>It's Reversed, It's Reversed</h3>
<p>— Iwa no</p>
<p>Mrs. Jin has been saying "It's reversed, it's reversed" to people recently. People don't understand the meaning of her "It's reversed, it's reversed." They want to ask her for clarification, but they don't dare to open their mouths because of her frosty and angry look.</p>
<p>One day last week, Mrs. Wang from the eastern neighborhood held a soup cake feast for her one-month-old son. Mrs. Jin, out of the friendship of many years of neighbors, went to congratulate her and was invited to be a guest of honor. Most of the people at the table were acquaintances, eating, laughing, and talking. They unconsciously started talking about daughters-in-law. As soon as Mrs. Jin talked about daughters-in-law, she immediately blurted out "It's reversed, it's reversed" again. Old Mrs. Shen at the same table had wanted to ask her what "It's reversed, it's reversed" meant for a long time. Today was a good opportunity, so she couldn't easily miss it, so she took the opportunity to say, "Mrs. Jin, what is 'It's reversed, it's reversed'? You've been saying it for a long time. What does it mean?" Mrs. Jin also felt that it was necessary to pour out this secret today, so she restrained her smile and said, "My son and my daughter-in-law got engaged last year. This year, in the midst of the gunfire, they were hastily married. Although the gunfire was shocking, I was happy to have completed my son's marriage. Because it was affected by the war, everything was frugal, so a maid was not hired. Everyone at home does things themselves. When the new daughter-in-law first arrived, everyone was very polite, so I didn't want her to do anything. I took care of all the things like washing clothes and cooking myself. I didn't want her to worry or work hard. I carried the food to the table one by one, and then went to call her and my son out to eat. After everyone had eaten, I carried everything back, put it away, and washed it. She and my son had already gone to their room. After a week, I felt that I had to speak up, but the new daughter-in-law was still polite after all, and I was embarrassed to say it to her face, so I called my son over and secretly told him, 'I am also over fifty years old, and I have always been served by servants, and I am used to being comfortable. Now we are trying to save money and not hire a maid, but we have added a daughter-in-law. I didn't want the daughter-in-law to serve me. I only ask her to help me with my work. Now a week has passed, and I think I will ask her to take charge of the housework tomorrow. If she says she is inexperienced, then I will guide her in everything.' You go and tell her that I will definitely hand over the work tomorrow." The son didn't reply that day. At ten o'clock the next morning, their door was still tightly closed, and they were sleeping soundly. I thought that if I went any later, there wouldn't be any good goods in the small vegetable market, so I went to buy vegetables myself. Their door was also open. I called my son out and said to him, 'The vegetables have been bought. Tell your daughter-in-law to come and pick and wash them quickly!' I deliberately raised my voice a little, thinking that she would definitely hear it and come out. Who knew that as soon as I finished speaking, a voice even louder than mine came from the room: 'I can't cook. I haven't learned how to cook. I can't serve people either. I'm used to being served.' To maintain harmony in the family, I swallowed my anger and continued to do the work myself. To this day, this burden is still pressing on my shoulders. With a mother-in-law serving her daughter-in-law and a mother serving her son like this, isn't it reversed? What is it?"</p>
<p>When Mrs. Jin said this, everyone sighed deeply. Old Mrs. Shen asked again, "If your daughter-in-law eats and does nothing, then what does she do?" Mrs. Jin said again, "She is busier than me! Every morning, she gets up after ten o'clock and asks my son to make water for her to wash her face. She looks in the mirror, puts on powder, draws her eyebrows, and dyes her nails. She is busy for an hour. After resting for a while, she wants to eat. After putting down her bowl, she washes her face, puts on powder, draws her eyebrows, and dyes her nails again. After everything is done, she either goes out for a walk with my son or plays mahjong at home. She doesn't go to bed until twelve o'clock at night. This is their daily routine." Old Mrs. Shen asked again, "What kind of family is she from?" Mrs. Jin said, "She is a female student who studies at some middle school. She hasn't graduated yet. Because she came to my house, she doesn't go to school anymore. I really don't understand. If girls read books and can't even do some things at home, then what's the use of reading these books?"</p>

<h3>Random Notes While Sweating</h3>
<p>— Xin</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>When you are drunk and full, the most suitable thing for you to do is to lean in the arms of your poetic lover and say in a trembling voice: "My love, how empty life is!"</p>
<p>But when you are not only not drunk but also full, you must remember that this sentence is useless to you. Because the suffering of "life is empty" is ultimately not as painful as "an empty belly."</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>A poet wakes up from a half-night's dream, looks at the cold moonlight shining on the window, gets up, pours a cup of cold tea from the night before, and drinks it. The taste is astringent and slightly bitter, so he sighs and says:</p>
<p>"Oh, your cold tea from the night before,</p>
<p>Is a symbol of the bitter life!"</p>
<p>Looking at the moon, the moon is still so cold, and the four walls are so silent that there is no echo. The poet finally collapses and falls down. Before long, poetic snoring is heard again.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>Tiny green worms see the light and fly in groups from outside the window to my desk. I stab them to death one by one with a pen. In an instant, a large pile of remains is piled up. Under this game of life, I feel the pride of the victor and the sorrow of the loser!</p>
<p>But who told them to head towards the light? Shouldn't the green worms?</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>In the evening, suddenly dark clouds rose, strong winds blew, lightning flashed and thunder roared, followed by heavy rain. A black dog trembled in the wind and rain, miserable. A silly child said: "Dog, where are you going to escape?"</p>
<p>(5)</p>
<p>Every time I walk through Nanjing Road, I never dare to raise my head, because I am afraid of seeing the chaotic "human beasts" rushing around. I am afraid of seeing the cars carrying flesh and blood rushing around in groups. However, looking at the ground, the ground also seems to be covered with blood and flesh. I have to close my eyes. Sparks fly in front of my eyes, and I vaguely see landmines buried all over the ground!</p>
<p>I think these landmines will explode one day!</p>

<h3>The Fallacious Views of Modern Women</h3>
<p>— Jin Nan</p>
<p>Now, most women think that dressing fashionably means being a new woman? With such a huge misconception, many women put effort into dressing up, focusing on Europeanization, in order to win the title of a new woman and get praise from men. In this situation, new women become special parasites who neither serve society nor devote themselves to their families. They not only eat their fill all day long and do nothing, but also constantly ask their husbands or parents for money, wearing luxurious clothes, putting on heavy makeup, watching movies, going to boring banquets, and making social interactions like showy prostitutes. It's most funny. They blindly shout the high-pitched rhetoric of women's liberation, but on the one hand, they are reversing the car of lowering their own status. Just talking about the many women who have received a new education, how many can be economically independent, how many can have a happy marriage, how many can improve the family environment, how many can make a little contribution to society, and how many can fulfill a responsibility to the country?</p>
<p>We should not generally and so seriously accuse the general fashionable new women or new women who worship material civilization. It is definitely not insulting women, but an objective theory, and at the same time, it is a great worry for those who seek to improve women's rights!</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to express my sincere hope that new women (don't be new in form,</p>
<p>But to be new in spirit.)</p>
