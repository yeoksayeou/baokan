<h3>美政府嚴重警吿日本</h3>
<p>照會中聲明不得侵犯美國權利與非戰公約</p>
<p>張樹森旅集中北票一帶抗禦日軍</p>
<p>美政府</p>
<h3>援用九國公約</h3>
<p>照會中日兩國政府</p>
<p>對日補充兩項意見</p>
<p>簽約各國或須召集會議</p>
<p>美法英三國取一致態度</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美國黼對於滿洲時局、今日已採行重要步驟、美政府援用九國公約、並向日本聲明美國將不承認事實上任何形勢之合法、或承認中日間礙及美國或其人民條約權利之任何條約或協定云、美國態度有此驚人變更、當然引起各種猜測、惟目前官場尙未有採行立即或積極行動、如斷絕外交關係等之建議、不過美國現不復以規勸語氣發言、但直接擁護其人民之權、利此乃人所公認者也、此種新發展、在國務卿史汀生發駐美英法大使談話後、倐然發生、當時英法大使曾吿人、三國始終携手工作、以應付滿洲困難、雖英法未有直接與美國合作援用九國公約之表示、但此三國對於此事意見、完全相同、固可認爲確定也、國務院今日又正式宣稱、與遠東有關係之列强、已决定採行敏速而明白無誤之行動、觀此則美英法三國意見相同之假定、更可得一明證矣、</p>
<p>美國現已送交中日兩國關於援用九國公約之文、開始便聲稱自錦州一帶軍事行動後、中政府中南滿之所有政權、如九月十八日以前所有者、即已銷滅、</p>
<p>繼謂美政府確信不久將遣往滿洲之國聯行政會調查團、將使中日間之困難、易於謀取一種解决辦法、但美政府覺有不得不照會中日兩國者、凡事實上任何情勢、美政府不能承認其合法、美政府亦不欲承認中日及中日代表間所立可損及美國成其中華人民之條約權利、而此權利凡、與所謂門户開放政策、與中國主權獨立及中國土地與行政完整有關者、亦包括在内云、</p>
<p>美國照會未叚、切實聲明凡與巴黎公約相反的方法造成之任何形勢·或條約·或協定、美國將不承認之云、</p>
<p>此文除送中日兩國外、並分送九國公約之簽字國、此文發出、未附議論、但此間於公佈此文、時使人注意於一九二九年美總統胡佛英相麥唐納所發之聯合文吿、蓋此文吿承認凱洛格非戰公約爲直接的國家政策之絕對責任也、此文發表後、雖引起極大之注意、但華盛頓官場不欲預言美國將採行何種實在行動、以保護美國利益、一般人意思以爲此文旨趣、先在表示世界對於保護中國的條約結構、爲人破壤之公憤、至於此後行動、大約須視今後發展而始决定之、現頗有人謂美國將立即採行嚴峻行爲、如對日斷絕外交關係之類、但政界並未有此消息、查九國公約擔保中國土地完整、規定簽約國不得覓取有礙他國之將殊利益、依該約第十一條之文字、簽約國必不可利用中國情形、以謀取可减削友邦人民權利之特殊權利、亦不得容許危及友邦安全之行動、簽約國並允不得彼此或單獨或集合的與任何他國締結損害中國主權獨立與土地行政完整之條約協定或諒解、如發生一種時局、爲任何簽約國認爲涉及本約條文之適用、而須討論適用辦法者、則簽約國間須有完全與坦直之接洽、衆意據此約文、簽約國或不久將召集會議、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）國務院今日發表一文、補充美國致日牒文之意、謂㈠美國絕不欲干涉日本在滿洲之合法條約權利、㈡美國不欲插聞日本所可爲之任何解决、惟附以任何解决不得損及美國權利或破壤凱洛格和平公約之條件、（八日路透社電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）今夜美國務院内又演一齣極重要之國際劇、國務卿史汀生邀集九大國代表於國務院、各送以美國新致中日政府照會副稿一份、并聲明美國對於遼案、已提出凱洛格非戰公約、希望他國政府亦發同様照會致南京東京兩政府、史民延見各大使旣畢、立召新聞記者分授美照會全稿各一份、其内容致南京與致東京者完全相同、按近數星期來、美國大部份人民紛紛指摘史汀生、對於遼案未能提出非戰公約或九國公約或兼提二約、各報主筆亦競請美國按照條約行事、否則明白承認國際非戰等條約爲廢紙、故美政府與英法意大使晤商後、卒有此照會、而其措辭據此間觀察時事者稱、更比預料者爲强硬、（七日國民社電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美政府致中日政府之照會、雖僅提出非戰公約、但其措辭實可兼賅非戰公約與九國公約意義、第未將九國公約正式提出而已、當史汀生將照會稿交各報發表時、未有附帶聲明、但據稱美官吏并不以爲美國照會足以侵及日本合法權利與干涉中日爭執、但以明確言辭質直聲明中日爭執决不可侵犯美國權利與非戰公約而已、按美政府此次提出非戰公約、係近數日來史汀生凱塞爾與英法意大使迭次晤商之結果、今美政府曾請九大國對中日致同様之警吿、料不日各國將有類似之響應也（七日國民社電）</p>
<p>紐約美國致日牒文、請日本注意於一九二二年華盛頓九國公約下之義務者、今晨各報皆以顯要地位登載之、紐約時報並登有請其他簽約國同様行動之消息紐約講壇報　此牒爲警吿日本、以保護滿洲門户開放與機會均等之政策、美國各處亦皆重視此牒、華盛頓各報且發特刊、評論此措詞嚴而有含蓄之牒文、（八日路透社電）</p>
<p>倫敦此間政界與外交界皆極重視美國因日本在滿政策而援用九國公約之行爲、有若干方面以爲簽定該公約之國或須召集開會、以處置中日間爭端、路透訪員所訪問之某外交要人、確有此意見、渠謂九國公約規定有關係國遇有一簽約國破壤約文情事應互相商榷、如日本軍事行動越過錦州、而進規中國本部、確將使日本覓得在滿或在華之特殊利益、而不利於他國、則此種商榷、實屬必要云、曾爲日内瓦英國總代表之薛西爾則以爲開會與否、尙難確定、但承認美國此舉、甚關重要云、國聯同志會要人慕萊敎授謂美國惜不早有此舉、若早行之、則衝突當更少也云、（七日路透社電）</p>
<p>倫敦孟却斯德指導報今日評論美牒、謂日本在滿政策、不能視爲與其在九國公約下之義務相符、乃九國公約竟未早日援用殊可驚異、今各國之自已利益、已受危迫矣國聯所已失敗者、各國當可容易成就之云、（八日路透電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）今日國聯中人聲稱、渠等歡迎美國對於遼案有此嚴峻之新舉動、國聯並無獨力和平解决中日爭執之唯一工具之意、苟會外有可行之方法、應各竭盡其效能、藉以維持遠東和平、此時國聯非待至理事會常會開幕、與調查團抵遼之後、不能再有所行動、所以美國之努力、可謂恰當其時、美國此舉乃續施壓力於日本、而此種壓力在遼案解决以前、必須繼續施行云、（八日國民電）</p>
<p>倫敦英外相西門今晨在外部召集各外交專家、考盧美國對遼致牒中日後英國應取態度、現美照會全文雖猶未抵倫敦、但聞英國將於今明日决定其應否踵美致牒中日問題、至英國照會雖無與美牒相同之必要、然聞英人亦仍主保持門户開放原則、又聞英外部係於星期三接其駐美大使報吿美國將發出照會消息、昨日外相乃邀法大使至部商榷英法所應取之方針、按法國駐英大使佛羅義、當一九二一年至二四年曾往駐華公使、（八日國民電）</p>
<p>美國照會</p>
<h3>昨已送達外部</h3>
<p>中政會將討論辦法</p>
<p>（南京）美國政府向中日兩國提出之照會、業由駐華美使詹森派駐京外交代表貝克於八日上午、將該照會送達外部、面交陳友仁接收、行政院長孫科聞訊後、八日午親赴外交部訪陳、披閲該項照會、并商議我國應取之態度及方法、（八日專電）</p>
<p>（南京）美國政府因錦州陷落、形勢嚴重、曾分送同様照會於中日兩國政府、其致中國之照會、業於八日由美國駐華公使在京代表裴克送致我國外交部、内稱、最近錦州方面之軍事行動、業將一九三一年九月十八日以前、中華民國政府在南滿最後存留之行政權威、破壤無遺、美國政府仍深信國聯行政院近日所派之中立調查團、必能使中日兩國間現時困難、易得最後之解决、但美國政府鑒於目前情勢、及其自身之權利與義務、認爲有對於中日兩國政府作下列通知之義務、即美國政府不能承認任何事實上之情勢爲合法、凡中日兩國政府或其代表所訂立之任何條約或協定、足以損及美國或其人民在華條約上之權利、或損及中國主權獨立或領土及行政之完整、或違反國際間關於中國之政策即通常所謂門户開放政策者、美國政府均無意承認、又凡以違反一九二六年八月二十七日中日美三國在巴黎簽字之非戰公約之方法而造成之情勢、或締結之條約或協定、美國政府亦無意承認之、（八日專電）</p>
<p>（南京）外部接到美照會後、陳友仁下午謁孫科報吿經過、聞擬於召集中政會議討論辦法、至對美府照會如何表示、現尙未决定、（八日專電）</p>
<p>（南京）某外交當局談、我錦州失陷後、外交形勢、異常緊急、當錦州未失前、國聯方面曾决議、中日雙方不能再有軍事擴大之行動、我國方面亦迭次警吿日本、勿再向錦進兵、乃日本藉口勦匪及自衛等語、竟置國聯决議及我國迭次警吿於不顧、實行佔領錦州、造成今日嚴重之局勢、在此情况之下、我國外交方針、當然不能再完全依賴國聯、因以前我國專依國聯爲解决中日糾紛之唯一途徑、所採方式或不無錯誤、以後當充分引用國聯以外種種力量、以求解决、對决國聯仍當努力、因國聯前僅引用國聯盟約第十一條、今國聯會將於本月二十五開會、我國决請引用盟約第十六條、請對日本實行經濟封鎖、壓迫日本撤退東省佔領區域内之日軍、至此次美國政府向中日兩國送出之照會、即國聯以外外交方式之一種、現我國態度對美國照會、除表示接受外、仍引用國聯以外之外交方式、並以美國重視非戰公約及九國條例、我國實有權請召開國際會議、以保持該兩條約、其關於我國本身者、對日本如此之侵略、當用强有力方法、如對日絕交、撤回使領等、</p>

<p>以喚起全世界之注意云、（八日專電）</p>
<p>（南京）某外交當局本日正式宣稱、關於日方所謂一九另五年中日秘密草約、我國自始即否認其事、嗣後亦屢經駁斥、早成死案、有案可稽、故自中國立塲言、所謂一九另五年密約、可謂絕無此事、政府當然置之不理、（八日專電）</p>
<p>（南京）外長陳友仁今日午後對路透記員發來談片、謂已接到美牒、渠立即予以注意、復文刻在考盧中、俟政府正式審定後、即可發往華盛頓云、聞中委會今晚八時開緊急會議、討論美國來牒及中國復文、預料復文明日可發、（八日路透電）</p>
<h3>日對美牒態度</h3>
<p>（東京）政府發言人今日評論美國援用九國公約之牒時、謂美國或以爲日軍在滿之行爲、破壤中國行政完整、但實則南京除名義外、並無行政權及於滿洲也、發言人指此次美牒與一九一五年是中日立約時美國來牒措詞相同、發言人謂日本决不能改變其在滿之行爲、因日本所行者乃爲維持其合法權利所必要之最小限度也日本不欲覓取權利、超過其依照現有條約所應有者之外、故爲此理由、日本僅可重行聲明其嚴格導守門户開放　機會均等之政策日本爲現狀所迫、暫據中國土地、但不欲久據之云、日政府現已接到美牒、但未接到他國來文、（八日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）日人對於美國最近照會態度、因政友會内閣之是否留任、猶在未定之天、故今夕猶覺難於確悉、惟外部發言人聲稱、日本準備重行辯明其在滿行動、不能適用非戰公約與九國公約、日政府並擬發一新宣言、重申日本在滿無領土之野心、（八日國民電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>甘地第三次入獄彬</h3>
<p>甘地於本月四日又在孟買地方被捕了。在他這是第三次的被捕。第一次是在一九二二年。第二次是在一九三零年。前後三次。他都以極安然的態度。朿手就逮。毫無反抗。這種平和馴服勇於犧牲的態度。或者正如泰戈爾所說。「他一生就是犧牲的别名。」</p>
<p>他這次被捕。是因爲他出席圓桌會議以後。深知英倫政府對於印度獨立毫無。誠意而準備復興非武力抵抗運動。返印後。他還曾要求面謁印督以資磋商。然而這平和的要求却換得了不平和的逮捕</p>
<p>甘地的被捕。並不是偶然的。當目前資本主義轉入第三時期發生空前的動搖與恐慌的時候爲着要苟延其生命。自倍益加緊其對於殖民地的榨壓印度是英帝國主義的外府。是英倫三島的養命之源。目前英國資本帝國主義者。正陷入極端恐慌動搖的悲境。國民政府之成立金本位之廢止。都足以證明英帝國主義者正急切企圖挽救其日瀕沒落的運命在此時期。而希望他能解除印度的銬鐐允許印度獨立。應只有世間上極愚笨的人。才存如此希望才作如此幻想圓桌會議之召集與所謂製憲問題之討論都。不過是一種覊糜政策。甘地貿然親去英倫出席。已是失着。而返印後復準備復興非武力抵抗運動其被捕自是必然的結果</p>
<p>然而逮捕一個甘地。决不能遏抑印度獨立運動的狂潮。反之以甘地被捕事件之刺激。當更足以打破印度人民希望英帝國主義者大發慈悲。容許其自治獨立的幻夢。澈底認淸帝國主義的眞意。更因而愈益堅定其奮鬥的决心。同時更便印度人民認淸和平反抗。只是一種極愚笨的政策。而走上另一反抗爭鬥的途徑。這時候一切對立着的鬥爭。日趨於尖銳化了。弱小民族的獨立運動。日益擴大。同時宗主國對於獨立運動的高壓。自亦日益猛烈。大的鬥爭即將展開。印度與英倫的搏戰便正是發動這一大的鬥爭的一聲號砲。甘地在就逮瀕行的時候。留書與全印大會會長貝台爾曾說。「請告國人永勿背離眞理與暴動政策。」貝台爾入獄之前。亦發表敬告全國文。有說「願全國以無暴動的飽滿精神作高尚之犧牲。」非武力的反抗和平的鬥爭這是甘地對英帝國主義者抗爭的一貫的政策。這政策對於印度的獨立運動。恰起了一種緩和作用。蕭伯納曾說「英國是用兵力征服印度。的而且又是用兵力壓制印度的。印度能用暴力奪得自由。亦如愛爾蘭用武力獲得自由。」蕭氏的話是對的。無論什麽純粹消極的政策有什麽效力。除非是爲愚蠢的保守而用。非武力的抵抗與和平的鬥爭想從帝國主義者的手裏奪回自由。正如一隻馴羊。想用眼淚向猛虎的口裏要回他的愛子恰無二樣。甘地在不久以前曾警告印度民衆謂。「上次奮鬥。印人曾與棍棒相抗。但此次奮鬥。或將與槍彈相抗。」甘地並不是不知道英倫政府對於印度的獨立運動的高壓。將日益嚴厲殘酷。然而他却敎印度的人民。準備絶對不抵抗的與無情的槍彈相抗爭。這是對敵人的寛恕。還是對自已的殘忍。羅曼羅蘭曾說。「他當甘地是一位只缺少了十字架的基督。一然而無抵抗的基督。究何有於印度廣大被壓迫羣衆的解放呢。</p>
<p>然而甘地究竟不能不算是一位偉大的領袖他的純潔的人格與博愛的精神。使全印度的。人都本能的聽從他的吩咐。使全印度各種各族的人都本能的尊崇他爲「瑪哈瑪。」當他一九三○年被禁在沙巴瑪提監獄的時候。一張印度報紙。曾有過這樣的記載。「到了晚上。必有許多人聚集在沙巴瑪提監獄。致敬於他們所愛戴的領袖。羣衆站在監前。如同站在廟前。一聽任人進監探視犯人的鐘聲響。羣衆就非常的歡喜。成羣來瞻仰的人都走近他們所崇敬的瑪哈瑪。有許多跪在他的脚下。有許多很敬畏的摩他。有許多深深的鞠躬致敬。」的確。正如泰戈爾所說「甘地不獨是印度最偉大的人物。而且是今日世界上最偉大的人物。」魯意曾說。「這小子。同木片那樣薄。能夠調動三百二十兆人。他一點頭。他說一句話。便是號令。他是他們的上帝」甘地的偉大與崇高。已經從他的敵人與朋友的譽辭裏。給予我們一個眞實的槪念了</p>
<p>解放印度。雖說終於不能在甘地領導之下實現。但甘地終不能不算是世界上一位最偉大的人物。</p>

<p>不除庭草齋夫談薈</p>
<h3>從燒煤爐談到敎育（上）</h3>
<p>我小時餐餐吃的是母親弄的現成飯，有時也到廚房裏去看看，好像現在流行的畢業參觀一般，從來沒有動過一次手，所以虚度了三十多年，簡直不知道燒鍋是怎麽一回事。我看媽媽燒得很容易，便自以爲眞的很容易，一看就會，何必費事把拉的動手去幹呢？</p>
<p>始於以爲一看就會，而終於半生不會，這奇事我是在三十五歲的時候察覺了。那年有一位窮朋友預備自己燒菜請我吃午飯。我自告奮勇去替他燒鍋，這次我是慘敗了。他把菜兒洗好切好，我的火還沒有燒着，只好自避賢路，讓他一手包辦。他一忽兒就燒着了。我問他的秘訣，他說··「燒鍋要用燒的炭作火引。」我聽了這話忽然悟到裏面含有重要的原理。從此運用先進學生去引導新進學生便成了，我這些年來的一種重要法門</p>
<p>民國十六年我開始燒過幾次火。那時我們用的是茅草。茅草容易點着容易熄。它一點着，轟出一團火，便化成灰。我把茅草一把一把的送進鍋竈裏去，一忽兒也不能走開，走開，火就熄了。你得接二連三的把茅草送進去纔能維持它的火燄。燒茅草火是多麽浪費精神的一件事啊！</p>
<h3>奇姓别錄</h3>
<p>— 蟬退</p>
<p>申報三十日本埠新聞所載全中國回敎代表赴印度朝天方的人名單中有買成章者世愚者承三。這買者兩姓不是很奇特的嗎。我在浦口掣騐局時。有一位買秋颿。是湖北嘉魚縣人。據秋颿說。『全中國的買姓。只有二枝。一枝在南京。一枝在嘉魚。至於買之得姓。約在隋唐時。由烏斯藏遷居中國的寗夏。』按烏斯藏這一條路。在隋唐時商務極盛。唐玄奘法師赴印度研究佛學。即由烏斯藏得達印度。南京買姓。頗有富名。亦由歷代以來。均從商務起家。小天樅館筆記。『有淮軍統領者貴。初投軍時。人間以姓。則曰。「我無姓」。蓋街市之乞兒。自糼失其父母。故不知其姓。其後積功。保至記名總兵。將具奏。合肥問之。亦以不知其姓對。合肥曰。「焉有官至總兵而無姓者耶」。統領請合肥賜以姓。合肥正閱官牘。</p>
<p>即曰。「汝認指一字可也」。所指爲「敬禀者」的者字。遂以爲姓」。照筆記所載。是者字之姓。由於指認。萬姓譜中實無此姓。但我記得家伯笙階侍御巡視南城時。奉旨查辦在理者。凡在官人役。均須飲酒一杯。吸烟一筒。乃得在官執役。時有皂役名者標的。見衆人均有畏懼之色。者標上前。飲酒三大杯。蓋者標是出名的酒鬼。此數日正以無錢購酒。興致勃發。將此官酒。遂暢飲云。又蘇州吳縣有差役名者標的。於賽金花充發吳縣。交地方官嚴加看管時。者標實爲看管的差役。但是賽金花於充發時。實係買人頂替。時知吳縣者爲李紫璈。李爲川人。與我家有昏因之誼。是日飲酒醉。慫恿紫璈傳取賽金花到案騐看。在我的初意。實在是游戲的舉動。孰料到案的賽金花是個替身。紫璈大怒。重責者標。交出原身。是時賽金花已在上海。聞此舉出於我的慫恿。竟來我的寓處。問我是何意見。我以此得識賽金花的廬山眞面。又得晤見這領袖江湖豪傑的大字班。遂致函紫璈爲解免之。後來我移家太湖的龍威洞。方知者標的勢力爲不可侮。今見申報所載的者姓。爲回敎的大宗。至小樅山館筆記所載的者貴。或者傳聞之誤。又良友雜志有老焱若爲中國製造家「老」姓亦狠奇特。因附錄之。</p>
<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>兩個大賊　法蘭西有一個專偷汽車的大賊。名加米戴卜希。ＣａｍｉｌｌｅＤｅｂａｕｏｈｅ據他自己說。曾在三年中偷得汽車三百○七輛之多。他的態度的鎭靜。眞是令人昨舌。有一次他在巴黎大街中偷得了一輛汽車。飛一般的開駛而去。不料被人看見。從後追趕。後來在十字路口被無數的車馬堵住了去路。不能再逃。他無可奈何。停住了機。一臂上披着外衣。立在車旁。當下他對巡警說。那偷車的賊已逃跑了。他見車中無人。所以代爲看守。以便交與警局。由失主認領。巡警還向他舉手致敬。那裏知道他正是偷車的賊人呢。美國也有一個大賊。名喬治狄根生。ＧｅｏｒｇｅＤｌｋｅｎｓｏｎ他出身優家。不愁衣食。白天在一家襯衫廠中當職員。晚間因要得到刺激起見。便出而作賊。每禮拜總有四五次出去幹他的　篋生活。末後失敗被捕。證明他在九個月之間。曾闖入七十家人家行竊。他的寓所中。發見首飾和珍玩無數。卿本佳人。奈何作賊。眞是令人不可思議。</p>

<h3>蝨大王</h3>
<p>— 芮禹成</p>
<p>吾友王丁午君。前曾在東北從軍多年。其同伍中有蝨大王者。頗名震於一時。卒亦以蝨而致命。前日王君爲余談及『蝨大王』之故事。頗奇。爰濡筆記之　據王君云。蝨係從人精變成。身體汚穢。即易生蝨。其故即因人體汗腺内排出之精液。經久不浴。遂變爲蝨矣。北方人以浴室頗少。洗滌不便。是故常人極易生蝨。但一日夜即可除之。法以衣服晾諸院落中。一夜後。蝨均凍斃。一振盡落。王君同伍中有戎君者。其腰部左右各有一「蝨洞。」徑如針鼻。常有蝨源自洞中爬出。每見戎君伸手至腰部一摸。立即有十數蝨集其掌中。緣此王君等戲以「蝨大王呼之。」厥後戎君即患「蝨囚」之症。此病名稱從未前聞。據云此疾乃不治之症。染者無不致命。故戎君亦死於此。埀危之際。七孔及肛門尿道等處。均有多量之蝨成羣而出。總數不下數十萬云。</p>

<p>第一回絶代名倡索居懷美眷異鄉學子浪跡締奇緣</p>
<p>但這個天所不容的應騐上。倒並非是那種謎信之談。天會降予他什麽災殃刦數。只是天旣誕生這樣一個希世的美人。自會賦給伊一種天亶聰明的特出的個性。看伊表面雖似温婉柔順。似乎知識不多。然而伊總是個人。人便有人的思候。零零星星的思着想着參照着。審顧着。漸漸聯綴成一整段的論斷。發現了伊自已是個沒有地位的人。是個專爲他人做玩物而勉强號稱爲人的人。沒有伊的獨立的人格。也沒有伊的自由的人權。度着鳥籠般的生活。還冒着喜怒由人愛憎由人到將來年老色衰不知作何結果的危險。伊就開始恐懼了。開始憤怒了。一種急於要做人而决不再做玩物的新思想。在内心裏烈火一般燃燒着。影響到伊那藴藏住的堅强熱烈的個性。也一同爆炸開表現開來。伊就發揮伊反抗的精神。施展伊立斷的妙腕。毅然去求自由。爭解放。儼然似一個戰鬥的勇士了。伊宣戰的動機。與作戰的經過。那時一般大小報紙。像紀載歐戰新聞那麽熱鬧。刋出許多紛歧的消息。事情雖看得很重大。眞相郤反而弄得很迷離。究不知那家報紙是探該得最翔實。好在這是過去之事。這裏不必求其詳確。簡單扼要的說。大槪是半年多以來那個老傢伙對伊雖還沒有十分虐待。只是内寵忒多。他老人家分身不來。未能常在小公館裏陪伴伊。偶而來了。又漸漸大模大樣。冷言冷語。沒有好臉子與伊看。前幾天伊出去到一家外國洋行。花十幾塊錢買了一雙絲襪子。被他曉得。嫌伊有點浪費。說了伊兩句。又對伊最心愛的那條小哈巴狗。厭煩起來。輕輕踼了一脚惹得那狗汪汪的直呌。伊受了這點委屈。緊扺着那挨踼的狗頻頻撫摩着。悄悄掉下幾滴眼涙。就從此對他沒再開口說過話。又過了幾日。伊便帶了那條狗飄然而去。找着個出名專打離婚官司的律師。向那老傢伙送出一件公函。聲請離異。那老傢伙看看勢難挽回。忽地大發慷慨。願意和伊平和了結。將小公館裏歷來替伊置辦的衣服首飾陳設器具。一槪奉送給伊。並另送他現欵三萬元作贍養費。最後還見過一次面。</p>

<h3>河下米漲風轉定</h3>
<p>滬南昨市來船不多、城鄉店胃平淡、蘇同白粳高緊次定、早晚稻胃口寥寥、價無漲跌、洋杜尖頂貨三筒、當日如數斛脫、價緊五分、變　二元、點心店購胃最健、買進六百擔、價漲角許、新閘天時轉晴西路來源三四十號、形勢一　不振、蘇常北粳早晨喊緊、及至午後轉呆、價軟一角薄稻連日猛跌、後路來貨必缺、杜埠尖到則不夥、胃亦淸淡、價照前盤、糯米交易梗殷情况穩定</p>
<h3>台州特别米新有到貨</h3>
<p>洋米本街銷路甚佳</p>
<p>昨日洋米市况、現貨本銷仍活、雖有大批到埠、而市面已有欣欣向榮之象、行情雖無大數上升、但比之上月中最低市價、已步漲半元光景、昨日仍以本街消化爲主、計開出小校米三千五百包、價九元　角至五角八分、一號西貢二千包、價十一元一角四分、期洋米洋行抛意仍健、昨日議價未妥、成交不多、回籠貨反見活潑、計售開二千噸左右、行情略見疲軟、開出小絞三月份四兩四錢、四月份四兩五錢半、五月份四兩七錢二分半、一號西貢二月份五兩二錢六分、</p>
<p>客秈湘贛兩地來源、已經絶望、皖省亦不多、惟温台收成尚佳、昨日又有新到台州特别白米、開出五百八十八包、價至十一元七角四分、亦爲本街辦去云、</p>
<h3>麵粉俏後續疲</h3>
<p>大連帮忽逐步回出</p>
<p>粉交年假停拍十天</p>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份微呈俏利因洋麥報價　好四角左右、及金市連日之趨高、人心不免看穩、故各月份較前日曾回好一分左右、惟交易不暢、實銷亦觀望居多也、迨至下午開盤、交易仍寂、惟聞大連帮因政　關係、販裝爲難、故又逐步回出、抛户雖未盛、市氣則又轉軟、觀此後如實銷冷淡、本月份之結局、仍不免有變化也、結果一二月份不動、三月分好二厘半、四月份不動、五月份小七厘半、六月份大二厘半云</p>
<p>麵粉交易所本月份拍至三十日、停市十天至二月份十日方始開市、已公告市塲云、</p>
<h3>小麥步低</h3>
<p>交念八起年假十三天</p>
<p>昨日期麥市面上下午開盤後、各月份市面、又呈平疲之象、以舊暦年關又近、業外多頭、均從事了結、更因賑麥售現關係廠家之存麥、當更豐厚、市上現麥、彷彿又少小去路、在此、環境之下多頭實少廻顧之餘地、所之本月份開價又步步低落、照業中之觀察、恐將來結局、尚須低於年前之收價遠期各月份、亦稍帶疲、結果本月份較前日跌五分、二月份跌三分、三四月份跌二分、五月份跌一分、六月份跌二分、雜糧交易所定本月份拍至二十八號、至二月十日再行開市、聞因理舊曆賬目、不得不得停云、</p>

<h3>歐美絲市益疲靜</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊絲市疲靜、緣歐美市塲、生絲開價奇小、廠銷不動、滬埠去電不轉、市氣沈寂、昨祇　昌等進白乾經二十五包、價均平疲云、</p>
<h3>春繭開價仍昂</h3>
<p>絲本每百斤須凈扯八百五六十兩</p>
<p>來白廠經歐美銷路、雖步趨疲滯、而乾繭市</p>
<p>盤仍難鬆懈、緣去歲春繭收成、江浙各屬均告歉折、鮮繭開價不廉、折頭（即烘繅折）又大、繭本較昂、繭商態度堅挺、繭價仍高、昨有閘北某絲廠補進常州東路春乾繭一百零八担、價開一百七十一兩五百斤繅折、繅絲一百斤、繭本須凈扯入百五六十兩云、</p>
<h3>婺源珍眉已有動機</h3>
<p>婺源北路珍眉、向以製法精良著稱、去年摩洛哥非洲等路銷茶市塲、因受日人宣傳破壞信譽、及日茶廉價競銷影響、銷路獨見呆滯、致滬市囤積不少、近來華來商鑒於國曆年關已過、爲脫貨救財計、不得不一再讓價求售、昨市已由保昌天裕等行、買進三百餘箱、售價百兩左右、較前見低四五十兩、華商大受虧折云、</p>
<p>五金黑鐵皮出路復活</p>
<p>黑鐵皮交易、前因來貨不繼、各帮採辦甚衆、因此市趨鋒俏、標準高至十一兩五錢有零、往後因津市生變、銷路頓呆雖各同業竭力設法推銷、但終以環境不佳、回生乏術、近數日來天氣　寒、各帮又復收辦、因此成交又旺、查昨日開出共有六七百擔之多、購户係北帮及本街廠家、行情雖一時不見進展、但比之先前已覺好起二錢、計十八張貨每擔估十一兩、三六尺貨每擔開九兩七錢半云、</p>
<p>煤炭開平煤市價略漲</p>
<p>各項開平煤自新年以來、因到貨稀少、公司售</p>
<p>價實行加漲、計現售開平特别　每噸十一兩、較前漲起五錢、開平一號　每噸十兩、二號　九兩二錢五分、各漲二錢半、又開平塊亦漲五錢、現售第噸爲十一兩而市塲同行拆出每噸　　另加二錢半至五錢不等云</p>

<h3>招商局輪罷風潮示解决</h3>
<p>停輪日多貨客全阻</p>
<p>每天損失一萬餘元</p>
<p>招商局全部船員·管事·生火·水手·等向局方請發雙薪、爲郭外峯拒絶、激成罷航風潮、業誌昨報、昨日雖經郭氏派人與船員等一度接洽、但因尚無切實辦法、風潮猶未解决、長江回滬之輪又復加入、取一致行動、惟聞此事已由雙方請杜月笙出任調解、今日可望討論此問題矣、茲將昨日消息、特再彙記如下、</p>
<p>六部職工團結昨日上午停航各輪之船員、召集駕駛部·輪機部·領港部·管事部·生火部·水手部·等全體職工、開大會討論進行工作、當塲議定六部分職工取一致團結的態度、對於船内之事務、仍各照常工作、俟所請之雙薪發到、便即開班、惟在雙薪未發之前、任何部份職工、不許與局方妥洽、如有私逢復航、破壞團體行動者、即視爲公敵、並須擔負全部雙薪之責任、當塲由六部分别訂立共同行動之合同、各簽名蓋章、以示堅决、請願市府黨部大會散後、由六部分各推代表一人、赴市政府社會局與市黨部請求援、助並陳述罷航之出於迫不得已、遂遞呈文一紙當由社會局市黨部接受呈文、並勸勉須遵守秩序、不可有軼出軌範之行爲、各代表認爲滿意、茲將其所呈之原文錄下、呈爲呈報事、竊查招商局夙以積弊見稱於時、雖自改隸國府之後、專員三易、以整理名義、昭告國人、其如肉食者别有會心、對於局員船員待遇不公、如每屆年終局員例有雙薪、惟有船員獨付闕如、而平時更有特别奬勵金、奬勵金種種名目、兩相比較、就二十年份内而論幾至多領三個月薪水更有局員任職不過四月、其間告病假二月、而意能領得五個月薪水、者舉此一端、其餘可知、故船員認爲歧視太甚、要求雙薪、絶不爲過、除口頭以外、書面要求已有二</p>

<p>營業損失一斑此次停停航之輪、先爲十二艘、至昨日又有長江輪江大江裕兩艘、自漢口下水來滬、抵申後、即行加入、取一致行動、現在輟班之輪、已有江輪五艘、海輪九艘、而營業上所受之損失、據個中人估計、每日須虧損一萬三四千元、兩天來已損失二萬餘金矣、昨日新銘等應行出口者、均不能開航、</p>
<p>江裕軍運特准昨到之江裕、輪亦在罷航範圍之内、嗣後忽奉中央電令、調該輪在滬裝載駐杭之某師官兵開赴漢口、該師軍隊已從杭州調來、不能遲延、遂由船員到會報告、請示辦法、經會中議决、以事關軍運、不容延誤、雖在罷航期内、自應准許開船、經全體同意、故江裕輪得以運載四師赴漢也、其他十三輪則不得自由開行、萬一局方仍堅持、會中準備派代表赴京、向國府請願、</p>

<h3>讀者通訊</h3>
<p>答案三則國民政府須名副其實不贊成罷課</p>
<p>試辦小工業王懋勛</p>
<p>㈠關於政治改革、過去的政治、仍舊腐化、是無庸遮飾的、今後第一件最先要做的、就是國府成立至今、名義上是國民政府、實際上我們國民何曾參過什麽政權、有幾個會議、是有國民出席參加的、我們的民意採用了沒有、我們民衆有沒有發言的自由權、所以我想最要緊的、要名副其實、此後國民應當參與一部分政權、有大部分的會議、國民也有參加的資格、要採用民意以及切實保障人民發方自由權、這才是所謂眞正的國民政府、此外當外交公開、不要使人民墮入五里霧中、更不要欺騙人民、使得民衆對於政府失去信仰、其他民衆應有訐發官吏權、不論是貪官汚吏·新軍閥·賣國賊·只人是大衆所公認的、民衆就有權去剷除、</p>
<p>㈡關於學生工作、我本人就是學生、我是贊成不罷課、的罷課固然是一種民氣激昂的表示、但我並不贊成這種表示、我們要從實際上表示、「最後一課」上的普魯士軍隊、已在吹號、但是學生仍然在上課、我們可以知道普魯士軍隊未占領前在上課、交戰時也在上課、要使沒有這樣的鎭靜、「最後一課」也沒有這樣的出名、要是沒有這樣的一个刺激、法蘭西也决不會恢復亞爾薩斯·勞蘭·兩省我以爲學生是除掉讀書、是沒有再比緊要的工作了、不過讀書决不是一味的死讀書、　如讀商科的、値此國難臨頭、更當拚命的研究仇敵的商業、以及我國何種國貨、可以暢銷於倭奴市塲、如何使得中國國貨暢銷於國際商塲、讀文科的、要去研究日本的文化以及其他各種的文化事業、至於讀工科的、要去研究科學、以及新的殺倭賊的戰具、另外農科、以及其他周學、都應該研究自已所學的功課、現在是讀書、最後是大衆携手合作、共同來抵抗倭賊、</p>
<p>㈢關於國貨製造、關於這一點、我有幾位同學、已經從事於發展小工業、現在已籌得銀一千元來試辦、先織帶子皮鞋帶、及其他各種鞋帶子、另外有幾位同學、預備製造　電器Ｃｏｎｄｅｎｓｅｒ以及礦石、其他無線電零件、因爲礦石　電器、大半均係仇貨、仇貨比歐美貨價廉、我國并無彷造、就是有售價也太昂、他們在計劃（我也　份子）至於能够成功與否、那又是一問題、至於其他各種小工業、以及仇貨暢銷我國、我國眞需要此種工業出品是多得狠、我願國人快點起來彷造、奪去仇貨的位置、（丙）</p>

<h3>南京路上的國貨商店幸</h3>
<p>從黄浦路向西走到新世界，門牌上註明是共有六百五十一家，當然這六百五十一家便是裝成金碧輝煌的南京路的各種各樣的商店。</p>
<p>在這六百五十一家商店中，純粹的國貨商店，在穿著方面的，只有三友三星安祿三家棉織公司，在吃食方面的，只有北萬韾五芳齋深大成三家點心店，王寳和王裕和兩家紹酒店，茂生和北萬有全金蘭三家茶腿店，另外還有逹仁堂藥材店，施德之藥水店，雙龍茶店，在日用方面的，只有建華麗華景德三家江西瓷器店，陳嘉庚橡皮鞋公司，義昌恒地毯店；在消耗方面的只有廣生行，品珍古玩店，合綜計算，只有二十一家，與六百五十一的百分比是百分之三，二强。另外還有幾家本來大部分是純粹國貨，但可惜却帶買少許舶來品，如酒菜館買洋酒，糖食店買洋糖，水菓店買洋水菓，所以槪不列入。也許這統計有遺漏不十分正確，但如上列舉的各店，也免不了還染有一些洋氣，如棉織廠的棉，如點心店的麺粉，恐怕用的還是外國原料，如果認眞分别的話，偌大一條南京路上的國貨商店，恐怕眞是寥若晨星，反之，純粹販賣洋貨的恐怕是佔絶對的大多數。</p>
<p>據一九三○年（民十九）統計，米的進口共爲七，一三八，四○六担，煤油爲二六，二○九，○二八美加倫，棉花爲二，七一九，六六○担，棉紗爲八，四五三担，麺粉爲二二三，六七一担，香烟爲一，八九五，二四五（單位千）枝，煤爲八六五，三六五噸，糖爲一，七四○，二二八担，至於上海港一處進口價額，共爲四七○，二三一，六二四海關兩，而出口價値則爲三一二，六六七，六四六海關兩，入超應爲一五七，五六三，九七八海關兩，由上述的數目字觀察，上海眞是一所消納洋貨的大市塲。上海人眞是養活外國人的大主顧。</p>

<h3>權威的假借徵言</h3>
<p>放工的鐘聲響了，我慢步踱出工廠，前前後後擠着無數的兄弟，都分向各人的住處走去，遠遠地我看見前面路旁有一羣人團聚着，滿以爲這一定是玩猴把戲的；待走到近前，才知道是一個白俄和一個黄包車夫在糾纏着。</p>
<p>「坐車不給錢，什麽道理？」車夫拉着那俄人的手臂嚴正地質問他，　　　那白俄的臉上，假裝着一種高傲的紳士的尊嚴，不理車夫，扔開手就走；車夫更憤怒了，趕上前去又把他拉住，問他要錢。</p>
<p>「你眞太不講理了，爲什麽坐車子不給車錢呢？」我在傍眼看着有些憤恨了，忍不住的這樣說。</p>
<p>「　　打！豈有此理！」看衆在嚷着。白俄看到情勢不好，連忙從口袋裏掏出兩毛錢擲在地下，怒眼望着車夫和我。</p>
<p>「你是那裏人？你做什麽的？」他似乎要對我不客氣。這時看衆的眼光都轉着我。</p>
<p>「我是中國人！我是中國的工人！」</p>
<p>我昻頭對着他說。</p>
<p>「我是大英國人！你可知道嗎？」白俄這樣說着便走</p>
<p>大槪他是想假借世界的列强的權威，來恐嚇我和一般看衆；然而大家却不約而同的，發出一種鄙夷的笑聲··「嗤」······「嗤」······「嗤」。</p>
<h3>朔風伊農</h3>

<p>你何竟這樣頑兇！</p>
<p>旣吹破了我的前屏，</p>
<p>爲何又想侵入我無抵抗力的病衾？</p>
<p>朔風朔風··</p>
<p>你眞是無情？</p>
<p>能否加憐於我臥病之身？（我之病身殆即我國之病身）</p>

<p>你這東西究是猙獰殘很·</p>
<p>不稍憐於我的病身·</p>
<p>豈僅不憐我病，</p>
<p>更欲了我殘生！</p>
<p>朔風··</p>
<p>你何必這樣逞兇！</p>

<h3>大衆的科學老師</h3>
<p>現在是什麽世界？是馬達世界，是電氣世界，是航空世界，是製造世界，一言以蔽之，曰，是科學世界，</p>
<p>中國是什麽中國？是貧的中國，是弱的中國，是知識低的中國，是能力薄的中國，一言以蔽之，曰，是科學落後的中國</p>
<p>科學落後的中國，要從速提倡科學，要努力研究科學，研究科學要多認老師，科學的老師在那裏？科學的老師處處都有，</p>
<p>孔子無常師，他入太廟每事問，每件事都成了他的老師，他又說，三人行必有我師焉，三人中即有一個老師，那末我們的老師，是何等的多啊！</p>
<p>我們只要虚心，不但人人是我們的老師，萬物都是我們的老師，家中　餵個難，難就是老師；樹上有個鳥，鳥就是老師，牆上掛個鐘，鐘就是老師，桌上擺個茶壼，茶壼也是老師，山中有野獸野獸也是老師，河中有烏龜，烏龜也是老師，即物方能窮理，萬物各有長處，親見一樣東西，而不知道追求他的用處妙處，眞可算是不如物，中國科學落後，即在研究科學者，不以萬物爲老師的緣故，</p>
<p>你不信我的話，看那蘋果！牠不就是牛頓的老師嗎？看那水壼！牠不就是瓦特的老師嗎？看那昆蟲鳥獸，那一個不是達爾文的老師呢？</p>
<p>大衆們，天地是你們的學校，萬物是你們的老師，只要你事事追問，處處留心，保你可以踏進知識的寳庫，</p>
<h3>科學游戲（續）</h3>
<p>（三）隔拳猜錢呌一位小朋友隨意拿幾個銅板在手，不必預告，我能猜出他拿的銅板數，我自已手中拿着已知的十餘個銅板（設爲十七枚）向小朋友說道··「你拳對我拳·凑足十文錢，還去你的本，我剩七銅板·」說畢·兩人伸掌相數，必恰如所言，不管小朋友拿的多少，理由假令我自已所拿之數爲１０十ａ</p>
<p>，小朋友所拿者爲ｂ·則二人之和數爲ｉｏ十ａ十ｂ十·兩人伸掌之後，先「凑足十文錢」即是由和數減去十，又還了你的本」即是又減去ｂ，所以「我剩」之數，必爲ｉｏ十ａ十ｂ－（ｉｏ十ｂ）二ａ，換言之，我自已手中若是十三，便剩三若是十四，便剩四，餘類推，此法原是一個最簡單的「代數」減法呵！（四）隔房猜數令一位小朋友任意寫一數（但須在一百零五以内）不對人言，在隔房中，先將原數以三除之，僅對我說明「餘數」不說「商數」，再將原數以五除，說明餘數，終以七除之說明餘數，此時我即能猜出「原數」，</p>
<p>方法視三除之餘之餘數爲每一個爲七十，五除之餘數每一個爲二十一·七除之餘數每一個爲十五·將三次之餘數相加，即得原數，但若加得之和數在一百零五以上，則須由和數中減去一百零五，始得原數·例如以三除餘一，以五除餘一·以七除無餘，則原數二７０Ｘｉ十２ＩＸＩ</p>
<p>十５Ｘ０二９Ｉ·又例如三除餘一，五除餘二，七除餘三，則原數二７０ＸＩ十２ＩＸ２十１５Ｘ３二Ｉ５７·但此數大於一百零五，故眞正之原數二１５７一Ｉ０５二５２·餘類推理由此係由算術中「分數公倍」演出·詳說出來冗長得很·恐怕小朋友們看了生厭，姑從略·（完）</p>

<h3>南京路上不牟利的電氣廣告幸</h3>
<p>南京路上電氣廣告，紅的，綠的，大的，小的，中文的，西文的，忽明忽暗的，每晚都是五光十色，照耀得如同白晝。不過這些廣告都是閃爍着誘惑人們的眼睛，每一個字，都用着絶大的吸引力，想抓住每一個路人的心·「注意我的，我當供你的需求，我當使你滿足，」每一個廣告，每一個字，都似乎發出這樣甜蜜而動人的喊聲。他的目的完全是爲牟利，簡直沒有一個是例外。</p>
<p>然而這裏却有一個例外，在雙龍茶店的側邊，有一塊竪排着六個大字的紅色電氣廣告，可是它並不是爲着牟利，六個大字便是「南無阿彌陀佛」。</p>
<p>不爲牟利，是爲着什麽呢？這是一個謎。或者有人說是爲着「救世」爲着「醒世」它正是「我佛」「一片婆心」的寫照··或者有人認爲是一種「裝飾品」正所以顯示南京路的斑駁陸離。</p>
<p>當一個老於世故的便便大腹賈，或者是一個一字不識的平民的目光，走過這廣告時，「南無阿彌陀佛」對於他會引起一種什麽作用，我想也只有「南無阿彌陀佛」才知道。</p>

<p>他所以會成爲現在的煤油大王，因爲銀行都相信他個人的格與信用，借給他四千圓以開頭經營的·他常說··「我駱克費洛是不會錯的，信用便是我全部的財產」以每月僅有五元十收入而出發的他，從不肯說一聲「我」的·他說··「我不過是我們中的一個罷了」所以，常常說着「我們」的他，可以成爲現代美國的權威者，就是因爲他充分的具備着那種資格··</p>
<p>上海故事</p>
<h3>上海故事（三）</h3>
<p>古蹟一</p>
<p>上海的歷史很短，從歷史的眼光來看牠，當然比不不上其他的都會，名勝古蹟，寥若晨星，比較重要的，要數靜安寺，徐家匯，龍華，這三處地方，要算是上海首屈一指的名勝了靜安寺古刹之旁有一古井，古時稱爲中國六大聖泉之一。每年春季釋加牟尼佛誕日舉行廟會，靜安寺的四面，形成一個極熱閙的集市，商賈咸集，士女如雲，廟中烟火迷目，路上摩肩接踵，陳列貨品，尤以竹器爲多。</p>
<p>徐家匯爲明末一大學者徐光啓的故宅，光啓生於嘉靖四十一年（公曆一千五百六十二年），爲中國土大夫最初加入基督敎會的一人，與西人利瑪　爲友，從他學習天文算術等科學，故西洋科學傳入中國，光啓頗負介紹之責，徐家匯敎堂之西南隅，有光啓之墓在焉。</p>
<p>龍華鎭有龍華塔，爲漢代遺物，有人又謂爲唐朝遺物，陽春三月，蟠桃花開，錦爛十里，點綴名勝不少，士女遊人，絡　於道。</p>
<p>開埠先聲</p>
<p>乾隆二十年，英人旣滅印度，東印度公司有畢谷氏，早已建議進行上海通商，於道光十一年（公曆一八三二年），東印度公司派遣阿墨斯特號商船自澳門出發，以林德色（Ｍｒ·ＨｎｇｈＨａｍｉｌｔｏｎＬｉｎｄｓａｙ）爲商業委員會主幹，經厦門，福州，寗波，要求通商，皆爲地方官廳所拒絶，遂到上海。上海官廳早知此事，最初想拒絶阿墨斯特商船入港，但以林德色多方設法，遂與上海道會見於天后宮，雖未蒙優渥，卒得陳述他的來意。上海道即告以通商口岸，以廣州爲限，上海不能久留，宜立即出口，林德色旣不得要領，遂率船赴朝鮮。這一叚歷史　可算是上海開埠的先聲。</p>

<h3>伶聯會小史</h3>
<p>上海伶界聯合會。爲上海全體伶工所組織之職業團體。成立於民國元年。本會宗旨。在聯絡同業感情。力爭伶工人格。保障伶工職業地位。發起之初。深得各界讚助。當時因鑒於伶界子弟失學者衆。遂創立榛苓學校。又因伶工亦屬國民一份子。應有捍衛國家之責任。遂創辦伶界商團。辛亥革命。追隨陳英士先烈攻破製造局。維持地方治安。工作甚爲努力。癸丑之役。伶聯會因讚助革命爲袁政府所忌。而遭非法解散。學校亦廢。會址且被軍警所佔。迨民國九年。經本會同當局力爭。始將會所收回。伶聯會乃告中興。學校遂亦恢復。至十八年。改會長制爲委員制。所有會務統歸執監委員負責處理。會務乃益臻繁複。而經濟所需亦與日俱增矣。</p>
<h3>伶聯會之經濟狀况</h3>
<p>伶聯會之各部委員。爲純粹義務職。絶不向會中支取分文津貼。此爲任何公團所絶無僅有者也。本會之重要費用。計有下列各項。</p>
<p>榛苓小學校······同業子弟。完全免費。並發給書籍用品。外界子弟之貧寒者。經會員介紹。亦可免費。現有學生二百餘人。因限於校址。報名逾額之學生。未能遍收。殊爲遺憾。</p>
<p>梨園公墓······舊墓在法租界康悌路。近因附近市面日盛。不宜營葬。乃遷至眞茹鄉公墓。計有塋地十餘畝。凡屬同業曁其家屬之病故者。皆能理葬於斯。不收費用。</p>
<p>養老院······伶工爲一種勞工職業。非如他業之能讑資格經騐者可此。故年邁力衰之同業。即無法工作。其間無子嗣奉養者。本人又無生活能力。本會乃設養老院瞻養期終老。院設眞茹鄉。衣食住皆由會中供給。</p>
<p>長生會······本會會員或其家屬之病故有。貧無以殮。由本會附設之長生會爲之箱殮。所有棺木衣衾。全由會中發給。不收分文。</p>
<p>寡婦糧······會員身故後。遺有孤寡。無以爲活。本會得按月酌給口糧津貼。</p>
<p>失業救濟······在盛暑嚴寒時本會爲體恤貧困同志起現。一經調查屬實。逐日助以貼費。以資生活。</p>
<p>濟助川資······吾界同業。客籍居多。偶有困頓本埠。或流落異鄉。一經同業之報告。本會即酌量助予川資。俾以回籍。</p>
<p>以上僅舉其犖犖大者。其他如聘僱員役之薪金。梨園公報之開支。以及會中一切雜支。臨時費用等。皆未列入</p>
<p>伶聯會費用浩大。而收入經費。僅有會員所得捐與長生會捐兩項而已。所得捐者。凡爲會員皆須按照薪金。月納値百抽五厘之捐欵於伶聯會。謂之五厘捐。長生會捐。不規定數目。用途亦僅限於施送棺木衣衾。故本會收入經費。祗五百捐一項而已。以有限之收入。應付數十倍之支出。此本會經濟之所以常告拮据。不得不仰求外界之援助也。</p>
<h3>伶聯會之演劇籌欵</h3>
<p>伶聯會會員。皆倚技藝糊口之勞動階級。如欲籌欵。舍集合全體會員合作表演戲劇以外。更無他法。此本會歷屆大會串之所以舉行也。本會歷承社會一棄。以伶界大會串之足以號召觀衆。每逢地方有公益慈善之事發生。恒有演劇籌欵之舉。而每度所籌欵項。爲數皆有可觀。今本會爲自身籌欵而表演大會串。乃亦不得不仰求。各界慈善君子之贊助矣。本會歷屆會串。事前皆不發戲劵。惟有以全體會員之力量。表演顧曲家不經見之好戲。以傳社會同情。敦請仕女。惠然肯來。旣來之後。復使人人潢意而去。務使諸君旣極聽視之樂。復收樂善好施之實益。是以每度會串。無不高朋滿座。譽爲梨園盛事。而愛談梨園掌故者。對此伶會籌欵之會串。尤不能不躬與其盛也。</p>
<h3>二十二屆大會串之恃色</h3>
<p>伶聯會以前會串多屬本界。而今次會串。獨請海上名媛。杜夫人加入。可見其藝術之精妙。實爲我界全體會員所傾服。。夫人固輕易不肯現色相者。此次因事關伶界公益。經本會再三商請。始允登台。表演其絶唱全本哭祖廟。本會爲求此劇之盡善盡美起見。特請全體名角擔任配角。事屬創舉。堪爲梨園佳話。此伶聯會會串中之空前特色也。機會不再。望嗜曲諸公。勿失之交臂。至哭祖廟之佳點。容明日續佈。</p>

<h3>US Government Issues Serious Warning to Japan</h3>
<p>Note declares no infringement on American rights and the Kellogg-Briand Pact</p>
<p>Zhang Shusen's troops concentrate in the Beipiao area to resist the Japanese army</p>
<p>US Government</p>
<h3>Invokes Nine-Power Treaty</h3>
<p>Note sent to both the Chinese and Japanese governments</p>
<p>Supplements with two opinions to Japan</p>
<p>Signatory nations may need to convene a meeting</p>
<p>US, France, and England adopt a unified stance</p>
<p>(Washington) The United States has taken significant steps regarding the Manchurian situation today. The US government has invoked the Nine-Power Treaty and declared to Japan that the United States will not recognize the legality of any de facto situation, nor will it recognize any treaty or agreement between China and Japan that infringes upon the treaty rights of the United States or its people. This surprising change in the US attitude has naturally aroused various speculations. However, there are currently no suggestions from official circles to take immediate or active actions, such as severing diplomatic relations. Nevertheless, the United States is no longer speaking in a tone of persuasion but is directly defending the rights and interests of its people, which is universally recognized. This new development occurred suddenly after Secretary of State Stimson's conversation with the British and French ambassadors to the United States. At that time, the British and French ambassadors told people that the three countries have consistently worked hand-in-hand to cope with the difficulties in Manchuria. Although Britain and France have not directly cooperated with the United States in invoking the Nine-Power Treaty, it is certain that the three countries have the same opinion on this matter. The State Department today formally declared that the powers related to the Far East have decided to take swift and unequivocal action, which further proves the assumption that the US, Britain, and France share the same views.</p>
<p>The United States has now sent documents regarding the invocation of the Nine-Power Treaty to both China and Japan, which begins by stating that since the military actions around Jinzhou, all political power of the Chinese government in southern Manchuria, as it existed before September 18th, has been extinguished.</p>
<p>It further stated that the US government is confident that the League of Nations' Commission of Inquiry, which will soon be sent to Manchuria, will make it easier to find a solution to the difficulties between China and Japan. However, the US government feels compelled to notify both China and Japan that the US government cannot recognize the legality of any de facto situation, nor does the US government want to recognize any treaty rights of the United States or its people in China that may be impaired by any treaty or agreement concluded between China and Japan or their representatives, and that these rights also include those related to the so-called Open Door Policy and the sovereignty, independence, and territorial and administrative integrity of China.</p>
<p>The US note specifically stated that the United States will not recognize any situation, treaty, or agreement created by methods contrary to the Paris Pact.</p>
<p>In addition to being sent to China and Japan, this document was also sent to the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty. The issuance of this document was not accompanied by commentary, but when it was made public here, it drew attention to the joint statement issued by US President Hoover and British Prime Minister MacDonald in 1929. This statement recognized the Kellogg-Briand Pact as the absolute responsibility of direct national policy. Although the publication of this document has attracted great attention, Washington officials do not want to predict what practical actions the United States will take to protect American interests. The general understanding is that the purpose of this document is primarily to express the world's public anger at the destruction of the treaty structure for the protection of China. As for future actions, they will largely depend on future developments. There are now many who believe that the United States will immediately take severe actions, such as severing diplomatic relations with Japan, but there is no such news in political circles. The Nine-Power Treaty guarantees the territorial integrity of China and stipulates that the signatory countries must not seek special interests that may harm other countries. According to the text of Article XI of the treaty, the signatory countries must not use the situation in China to seek special rights that may diminish the rights of the people of friendly nations, nor allow actions that endanger the safety of friendly nations. The signatory countries also agree not to conclude treaties, agreements, or understandings, whether among themselves, individually, or collectively with any other country, that harm the sovereignty, independence, and territorial and administrative integrity of China. If a situation arises that any signatory country believes involves the application of the provisions of this treaty and requires discussion of the methods of application, then there must be full and frank contact among the signatory countries. According to the general opinion, the signatory countries may soon convene a meeting. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The State Department today issued a document supplementing the meaning of the US note to Japan, stating: 1) The United States has no intention of interfering with Japan's legitimate treaty rights in Manchuria; 2) The United States does not want to intervene in any solution that Japan may be able to achieve, but with the condition that any solution must not harm American rights or undermine the Kellogg-Briand Pact. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Another extremely important international drama unfolded in the US State Department tonight. Secretary of State Stimson invited representatives of the nine major powers to the State Department and presented each with a copy of the US's new note to the Chinese and Japanese governments, declaring that the United States has brought up the Kellogg-Briand Pact regarding the Liaoning issue and hopes that other governments will also issue similar notes to the Nanjing and Tokyo governments. After Stimson met with the ambassadors, he immediately summoned newspaper reporters and distributed a full copy of the US note to each of them. The content of the notes to Nanjing and Tokyo were exactly the same. In recent weeks, most of the American people have criticized Stimson for failing to bring up the Kellogg-Briand Pact or the Nine-Power Treaty, or both, regarding the Liaoning issue. Newspaper editors have also urged the United States to act in accordance with the treaties, or else explicitly admit that international treaties such as the non-aggression pact are scraps of paper. Therefore, after the US government met with the British, French, and Italian ambassadors, it finally issued this note, and its wording, according to observers here, is even stronger than expected. (National News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Although the US government's note to the Chinese and Japanese governments only mentions the Kellogg-Briand Pact, its wording actually covers the meaning of both the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the Nine-Power Treaty. It simply did not formally present the Nine-Power Treaty. When Stimson handed the draft of the note to the newspapers for publication, he did not attach any statements, but it is said that American officials do not believe that the US note is sufficient to infringe upon Japan's legitimate rights or interfere in the Sino-Japanese dispute, but in clear terms, it directly declares that the Sino-Japanese dispute must not infringe upon American rights and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. The US government's raising of the Kellogg-Briand Pact this time is the result of repeated meetings between Stimson, Cassel, and the British, French, and Italian ambassadors in recent days. Now that the US government has asked the nine major powers to issue similar warnings to China and Japan, it is expected that various countries will have similar responses soon. (National News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>New York newspapers published the US note to Japan, which asks Japan to pay attention to its obligations under the 1922 Washington Nine-Power Treaty, in prominent positions this morning. The New York Times also published news of a request for other signatory countries to take similar actions. The New York Tribune reported that this note is a warning to Japan to protect the Open Door Policy and the policy of equal opportunity in Manchuria. The United States also attaches great importance to this note. Washington newspapers have also issued special editions commenting on this strongly worded and subtly worded note. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>London political and diplomatic circles here attach great importance to the US's invocation of the Nine-Power Treaty because of Japan's policies in Manchuria. Some believe that the countries that signed the treaty may need to convene a meeting to deal with the dispute between China and Japan. A diplomatic figure interviewed by a Reuters reporter did have this opinion. He said that the Nine-Power Treaty stipulates that if a related country encounters a signatory country that violates the terms of the treaty, they should consult each other. If Japan's military actions go beyond Jinzhou and advance into mainland China, which will indeed allow Japan to seek special interests in Manchuria or China that are detrimental to other countries, then such consultation is indeed necessary. Cecil, who was the British representative in Geneva, believes that it is still difficult to determine whether to hold a meeting, but acknowledges that the US action is very important. Professor Murray, an important figure in the League of Nations Association, said that it is a pity that the United States did not take this action earlier, and if it had been done earlier, there would have been fewer conflicts. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>London The Manchester Guardian commented on the US note today, saying that Japan's policies in Manchuria cannot be regarded as consistent with its obligations under the Nine-Power Treaty, and it is surprising that the Nine-Power Treaty was not invoked earlier. Now the self-interests of various countries have been threatened, and what the League of Nations has failed to achieve can be easily achieved by various countries. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, people in the League of Nations stated that they welcome the US's new and stern move regarding the Liaoning issue. The League of Nations does not intend to be the only tool for peacefully resolving the Sino-Japanese dispute. If there are feasible methods outside the League, all should do their best to maintain peace in the Far East. At this time, the League of Nations cannot take any further action until the opening of the regular meeting of the Council and after the investigation team arrives in Liaoning. Therefore, the efforts of the United States can be said to be timely. The US move is to continue to exert pressure on Japan, and this pressure must continue to be exerted until the Liaoning issue is resolved. (National News Agency, 8th)</p>
<p>London British Foreign Secretary Simon summoned various diplomatic experts to the Foreign Office this morning to consider what attitude Britain should take after the US sent notes to China and Japan. Although the full text of the US note has not yet arrived in London, it is reported that Britain will decide today or tomorrow whether it should follow the US in sending notes to China and Japan. Although the British note does not need to be the same as the US note, it is reported that the British still advocate maintaining the principle of the Open Door Policy. It is also reported that the Foreign Office received a report from its ambassador to the United States on Wednesday that the United States would issue a note. Yesterday, the Foreign Secretary invited the French ambassador to the ministry to discuss the policy that Britain and France should take. It should be noted that the French ambassador to the United Kingdom, Floguet, was once the French minister to China from 1921 to 1924. (National News Agency, 8th)</p>
<p>US Note</p>
<h3>Has Been Delivered to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Yesterday</h3>
<p>Central Political Council will discuss measures</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The note presented by the US government to the Chinese and Japanese governments was delivered to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by Baker, the diplomatic representative of the US Minister to China, Johnson, in Beijing on the morning of the 8th, and was received by Chen Youren in person. After hearing the news, Sun Ke, President of the Executive Yuan, visited Chen at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the afternoon of the 8th to read the note and discuss the attitude and methods that China should adopt. (Special dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The US government, due to the fall of Jinzhou and the serious situation, sent similar notes to the governments of China and Japan. The note to China was delivered to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 8th by Baker, the representative of the US Minister to China in Beijing. It stated that the recent military actions in the Jinzhou area have completely destroyed the last remaining administrative authority of the Republic of China in southern Manchuria before September 18, 1931. The US government still firmly believes that the neutral investigation team recently dispatched by the Council of the League of Nations will make it easier to find a final solution to the current difficulties between China and Japan. However, in view of the current situation and its own rights and obligations, the US government believes that it has the obligation to notify the governments of China and Japan of the following: The US government cannot recognize any de facto situation as legal. The US government has no intention of recognizing any treaty or agreement concluded by the governments of China and Japan or their representatives that may impair the treaty rights of the United States or its people in China, or impair the sovereignty, independence, or territorial and administrative integrity of China, or violate the international policy on China, which is commonly known as the Open Door Policy. Furthermore, the US government also has no intention of recognizing any situation created or any treaty or agreement concluded in a manner that violates the Kellogg-Briand Pact signed by China, Japan, and the United States in Paris on August 27, 1926. (Special dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the Ministry of Foreign Affairs received the US note, Chen Youren visited Sun Ke in the afternoon to report on the process. It is reported that it is planned to convene a meeting of the Central Political Council to discuss measures. As for how to respond to the US government's note, no decision has yet been made. (Special dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain diplomatic authority said that after the fall of Jinzhou, the diplomatic situation is extremely urgent. Before Jinzhou was lost, the League of Nations had resolved that China and Japan should not have any further military expansion. China had also repeatedly warned Japan not to advance further towards Jinzhou. However, Japan, on the pretext of suppressing bandits and self-defense, disregarded the resolution of the League of Nations and China's repeated warnings, and actually occupied Jinzhou, creating today's serious situation. Under these circumstances, China's diplomatic policy can no longer completely rely on the League of Nations. Because in the past, China exclusively relied on the League of Nations as the only way to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute, the methods adopted may not have been without errors. In the future, China should fully utilize various forces other than the League of Nations to seek a solution. Efforts should still be made towards the League of Nations, because the League of Nations previously only cited Article XI of the League of Nations Covenant. The League of Nations will hold a meeting on the 25th of this month, and China is determined to cite Article XVI of the Covenant and request economic sanctions against Japan to force Japan to withdraw its troops from the occupied areas in the Eastern Provinces. As for the note sent by the US government to China and Japan this time, it is one of the diplomatic methods other than the League of Nations. China's attitude towards the US note, in addition to expressing acceptance, will also cite diplomatic methods outside the League of Nations, and because the United States attaches importance to the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the Nine-Power Treaty, China has the right to request the convening of an international conference to maintain the two treaties, which are related to China itself. In the face of such aggression by Japan, strong measures should be taken, such as severing diplomatic relations with Japan and withdrawing ambassadors and consuls.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) A certain diplomatic authority formally declared today that regarding the so-called secret Sino-Japanese draft treaty of 1905, China has denied it from the beginning and has repeatedly refuted it since then. It has long been a dead case and there are records to prove it. Therefore, from China's standpoint, the so-called secret treaty of 1905 can be said to have never existed, and the government will naturally ignore it. (Special dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Foreign Minister Chen Youren issued a statement to Reuters reporters this afternoon, saying that he had received the US note and immediately paid attention to it. The reply is currently being considered and will be sent to Washington after formal approval by the government. It is reported that the Central Committee will hold an emergency meeting at 8:00 tonight to discuss the US note and China's reply. It is expected that the reply can be sent tomorrow. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<h3>Japan's Attitude Toward the US Note</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) A government spokesman commented on the US's note invoking the Nine-Power Treaty today, saying that the United States may believe that the actions of the Japanese army in Manchuria have destroyed China's administrative integrity, but in reality, Nanjing has no administrative power over Manchuria except in name. The spokesman pointed out that the wording of this US note is the same as that of the US note in 1915 when China and Japan concluded a treaty. The spokesman said that Japan cannot change its actions in Manchuria, because what Japan is doing is the minimum necessary to maintain its legitimate rights. Japan does not want to seek rights beyond what it is entitled to under existing treaties. Therefore, for this reason, Japan can only reiterate its strict adherence to the Open Door and Equal Opportunity policy. Japan is temporarily occupying Chinese territory because it is compelled by the current situation, but it does not want to occupy it for long. The Japanese government has now received the US note, but has not received documents from other countries. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The attitude of the Japanese people towards the recent US note is still difficult to ascertain tonight because whether the Seiyukai cabinet will remain in office is still undecided. However, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that Japan is prepared to reaffirm that its actions in Manchuria cannot be applied to the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the Nine-Power Treaty. The Japanese government also intends to issue a new declaration reiterating that Japan has no territorial ambitions in Manchuria. (National News Agency, 8th)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Gandhi Imprisoned for the Third Time</h3>
<p>Gandhi was arrested again in the Mumbai area on the fourth of this month. This is his third arrest. The first was in 1922, and the second was in 1930. In all three instances, he was arrested with extreme composure, submitting to capture without resistance. This attitude of peaceful submission, docility, and willingness to sacrifice is perhaps, as Tagore said, "His whole life is synonymous with sacrifice."</p>
<p>His arrest this time is because, after attending the Round Table Conference, he realized that the British government had no sincerity regarding Indian independence and prepared to revive the non-violent resistance movement. After returning to India, he even requested an audience with the Viceroy to discuss the matter. However, this peaceful request was met with a violent arrest.</p>
<p>Gandhi's arrest is not accidental. As capitalism enters its third stage and faces unprecedented turmoil and panic, it intensifies its exploitation of colonies to prolong its life. India is the outer treasury of the British Empire, the lifeblood of the British Isles. Currently, British capitalist imperialists are in a state of extreme panic and turmoil. The establishment of the Nationalist Government and the abandonment of the gold standard both prove that British imperialists are desperately trying to save their declining fate. At this time, to hope that they would lift India's shackles and allow Indian independence would only be done by the most foolish people in the world. The convening of the Round Table Conference and the discussion of the so-called constitutional issues are merely appeasement tactics. Gandhi's rashly going to London to attend was already a misstep, and his preparing to revive the non-violent resistance movement after returning to India made his arrest inevitable.</p>
<p>However, arresting one Gandhi cannot contain the surging tide of the Indian independence movement. On the contrary, the stimulus of Gandhi's arrest will further shatter the Indian people's illusion that the British imperialists will be merciful and allow their autonomy and independence. They will thoroughly recognize the true intentions of imperialism and become even more determined in their struggle. At the same time, it will make the Indian people realize that peaceful resistance is only a foolish policy and embark on another path of resistance and struggle. At this time, all opposing struggles are becoming increasingly acute. The independence movements of weak and small nations are expanding daily, and the high-pressure tactics of the suzerain states against independence movements are also becoming increasingly fierce. A great struggle is about to unfold. The battle between India and Britain is precisely the starting gun for launching this great struggle. Gandhi, when facing arrest, left a letter to the president of the All-India Congress Committee, Patel, saying, "Please tell the people of the nation never to abandon truth and the policy of non-violence." Before entering prison, Patel also issued a statement to the nation, saying, "May the whole country make noble sacrifices with a non-violent and full spirit." Non-violent resistance and peaceful struggle are Gandhi's consistent policies for resisting British imperialists. This policy has played a mitigating role in the Indian independence movement. George Bernard Shaw once said, "Britain conquered India with military force and suppresses India with military force. India can seize freedom with violence, just as Ireland gained freedom with military force." Shaw's words are correct. Whatever pure non-violence is effective, unless it is for foolish conservatism. Non-violent resistance and peaceful struggle to regain freedom from the hands of imperialists are like a docile sheep trying to use tears to get its beloved child back from the mouth of a tiger. Gandhi warned the Indian people not long ago, saying, "In the last struggle, Indians fought with sticks, but in this struggle, they may fight with guns." Gandhi is not unaware that the British government's suppression of the Indian independence movement will become increasingly severe and brutal. Yet he teaches the people of India to prepare for absolute non-resistance and to struggle against ruthless gunfire. Is this forgiveness to the enemy or cruelty to oneself? Romain Rolland once said, "He considers Gandhi a Christ who only lacks the cross." However, what does a non-resistant Christ have to offer to the liberation of the vast oppressed masses of India?</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Gandhi cannot be regarded as anything less than a great leader. His pure personality and philanthropic spirit have caused all the people of India to instinctively obey his orders and have caused people of all ethnic groups in India to instinctively respect him as "Mahatma." When he was imprisoned in Sabarmati Prison in 1930, an Indian newspaper had the following record: "In the evening, many people gather at Sabarmati Prison to pay their respects to their beloved leader. The masses stand in front of the prison as if standing in front of a temple. When they hear the bell ringing for people to visit prisoners, the masses are very happy. The people who come to admire him approach their revered Mahatma. Many kneel at his feet, many revere him, and many bow deeply in respect." Indeed, as Tagore said, "Gandhi is not only the greatest figure in India but also the greatest figure in the world today." Romain Rolland said, "This little man, as thin as a piece of wood, can mobilize 320 million people. He nods, he speaks a word, and it is an order. He is their God." Gandhi's greatness and nobility have already given us a true concept from the praises of his enemies and friends.</p>
<p>Although the liberation of India will ultimately not be realized under Gandhi's leadership, Gandhi still cannot be regarded as anything less than one of the greatest figures in the world.</p>

<h3>Decision to Reduce Military Spending</h3>
<p>(Beiping) A certain foreign newspaper reported this morning that there have been rumors recently that Zhang Xueliang is about to resign. According to reliable sources, this is not true. However, as the situation in the Northeast becomes increasingly tense, he has repeatedly expressed the necessity of actively uniting with generals from all sides to maintain public security in North China. After the establishment of the new government, Zhang still maintains his usual attitude. Due to financial difficulties, he hopes that the new government can formulate a financial plan under the centralized tax revenue to maintain local needs. The military expenditure in the North is insufficient by one million. Zhang has decided to cut administrative expenses by 20%, starting with the Northeast Army. This plan will be announced soon. The Beiping Military and Financial Affairs Committee has decided not to establish a chairman and will have committee members from the two committees take turns serving as chairman.

<h3>Korean Patriot Attempts to Assassinate Japanese Emperor Unsuccessful</h3>
<p>Hand Grenade Mistakenly Hits Accompanying Vehicle</p>
<p>Lee Bong-chang Arrested on the Spot</p>
<p>Inukai Cabinet's Resignation Not Approved</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 8th - This morning, when the Japanese Emperor was returning to the palace after the New Year's inspection, near the Sakuradamon gate in front of the palace, a Korean suddenly threw a bomb that hit the accompanying vehicle. The explosion was very loud and shocked everyone. Fortunately, no one was injured, only a horse was slightly injured. The assailant was arrested on the spot. He was identified as a Korean named Asayama, 32 years old. After being taken to the police station, he was searched and another bomb was found in his pocket. The motive for the attack has not been revealed, but it is believed to be inspired by the resurgence of the Indian independence movement. The police authorities believe that the Korean may have been impulsive because of the recent reports of the Indian non-violent resistance movement. The Cabinet offered its resignation this afternoon because the Emperor's entourage was attacked, but the Emperor ordered Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi to continue to serve as usual, pending further instructions. It is believed that the Emperor will consult with his advisors and may accept the Cabinet's resignation. It is reported that after interrogation, the assailant admitted that the two bombs were supplied by the Provisional Korean Government in Shanghai, and he was also given 300 Japanese yen.</p>
<p>National, Tokyo, 8th - The Japanese Cabinet has tendered its resignation, led by Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi, due to the assassination attempt on the Japanese Emperor by a Korean. Inukai entered the palace and presented the Cabinet's resignation to the Emperor at around 5:00 PM today, expressing that the Seiyukai party bears full responsibility for this incident. This kind of resignation is actually just a formality, because it is not enough to express the Japanese people's respect for the imperial family. As for the Korean who assassinated the Japanese Emperor, he is a nationalist, from Seoul, named Lee Bong-chang (transliteration). At 11:45 AM this morning, when the Emperor was returning to the palace after reviewing the troops, he threw a hand grenade at the Emperor's car, but failed to hit the Emperor's car, and it only exploded next to the third accompanying vehicle. The car was slightly damaged, but there were no injuries. The Emperor returned to the palace safely, and the Korean was arrested on the spot. He is currently under strict surveillance and may soon face the death penalty. Since the Japanese army invaded the eastern provinces of China, the Indian national revolutionary movement has followed, and the restoration movement within Korea has shown a vigorous trend. The police authorities were ordered in advance to take strict precautions, so after this incident occurred, the authorities immediately conducted a thorough investigation to see if there were any accomplices.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 8th - When the Japanese Emperor was returning to the palace after the military review this afternoon, near Sakuradamon, at the corner in front of the Kojimachi Ward Sakuradacho Police Station, a Korean named Lee Bong-chang, renamed Kinoshita Shozo, 32 years old, living in Tokyo's Nishikicho, threw a hand grenade at the Emperor when the Emperor's car was about to enter the gate. Fortunately, the car was moving fast and the bomb fell on the second carriage of the attendants, none of whom were injured. The Emperor was extremely frightened and almost fell out of the car. The perpetrator was arrested on the spot.</p>

Regarding the organization of this alliance, Soviet Russia originally adopted a secret policy, but it was only recently discovered by various countries. (World News Agency)</p>
<p>All India Congress</p>
<h3>New President Arrested Again</h3>
<p>Authorities Block Economy to Curb Chaos</p>
<p>Avoid Reckless Use of Force Against Mobs</p>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, 8th - Dr. Ansari, Acting President of the All India Congress, was arrested here today, further restricting the activities of the Congress. It is reported that members of the Congress plan to attack government salt warehouses, which will be the most serious development. If implemented, the government will take severe measures to deal with it. The Illegal Societies Act was implemented in the Dexing Province today. Red posters were posted on the walls of the Bombay Empire Building, with fierce slogans threatening British officials, which are said to have been made by the Hindustan Republican Association.</p>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, 8th - The police are still engaged in the search and arrest of the leaders of the All India Congress, but today they also discussed adopting a new method of dealing with them, planning to notify those concerned, prohibiting them from speaking at Congress venues, and requiring them to report their daily activities to the police station. Violators will be sentenced to two years in prison. It is reported that the legal advisor of the All India Congress is now considering presenting a petition to the High Court to send Gandhi to the court for trial, so as to debate whether the imprisonment is justified. The government is now planning to find ways to block the economic sources of the All India Congress, causing it to be in trouble due to lack of funds. Judging from the situation, the government is now willing to try its best to avoid using force against the mobs and to use economic martial law to curb the activities of the Congress. The government is taking a policy of arresting the leaders of the All India Congress on the one hand, and trying to avoid using police batons against the masses on the other hand, and only using them when necessary, so as to avoid sending many injured people to the hospital. This policy already has signs today. There are crowds watching the picket team and the road is blocked. In normal times, the police would disperse them with batons, but now they only gently persuade them to give way to the side of the road. The Governor-General announced the invitation to several important leaders of the moderates to hold a meeting. Some people in several circles believe that the Governor-General intends to convene a conference of political leaders of India. In fact, this is not the case. India only wants to meet with several representatives who participated in the Round Table Conference. During the meeting, of course, it is necessary to discuss the overall situation caused by non-violent resistance. However, the main purpose is to solicit figures in the constitutional field in order to facilitate the work of the investigation committee that will arrive in India soon. There is now an application for the Governor-General to convene a conference of parts of the community willing to cooperate with the government as soon as possible to discuss the best way to implement the constitutional progress program set by British Prime Minister MacDonald.</p>

<h3>Public Telegram</h3>
<p>The Hubei Flood Relief Committee Begs for Donations Telegram to the Shanghai Shenbao Newspaper: The severity of the floods in Hubei this year is unprecedented in a century. This committee started emergency relief work in early summer, thinking that it could be concluded by autumn and winter. Unexpectedly, the number of disaster victims in Wuhan is increasing, and the hardship is even more serious than during the emergency relief period. In summer, they can sleep outdoors, but now the weather is cold and freezing, and they must have rooms or sheds. In summer, they can go out and in barefoot, but now it is raining and snowing, and the north wind is howling. The wealthy are not warm even in heavy furs, and those who survived the disaster are mostly unable to cover their bodies with clothes. Therefore, every time the sky is overcast, the stiff are lying on the road, and people are ordered to bury them everywhere. Coffins are nowhere to be bought. The official dams and civilian embankments of the counties have been breached and collapsed, and they are all in sight. If you want to repair them, there is no way to start. The most bitter thing is that the houses that were flooded in Daoguang Wushen and Jiyou have not been restored for eighty years. This year's flood has flooded villages, and most of the houses have been destroyed and turned into ruins. If they enter the mountains, they have long been occupied by Red bandits, and if they return home, they have lost their base early. There is no way to advance or retreat, and the only way is to rush to Wuhan. As of the end of the national calendar year, those who have been given relief by this committee in turn have registers to check. In the Wuchang area, Hongshan, Luojia Mountain, Meizi Mountain, Changchun Temple, and areas outside the Dadongmen still have more than 200,000 disaster victims. In Hanyang, there are 108,000 disaster victims in Hushan alone. Hankou is double that of Wuyang, so in terms of the three towns of Wuhan, the monthly expenditure is not less than 400,000 yuan. Now we have tried our best to deal with it for six or seven months. Chang'an is not easy, and the coming day will be difficult. The colleagues of this committee have been running around and calling for help, their voices are hoarse and their lips are worn out, and there is no way to save them. We want to do it, but we can't. As for the previous emergency relief, when we first started, we hired ships, built sheds, distributed rice, provided medical care, and salvaged floating corpses. We responded in a hurry and started on a grand scale. The funds were all scraped together from the east and west. Now that the end of the year is coming, it is not easy to clear the accounts and ask for loans. The daily food consumption of each shelter, and the relief of each disaster-stricken county, Wuhan needs to pay 10,000 to 20,000 yuan per day. Each county receives rice, clothes, and wheat, ranging from tens of thousands to thousands. As for the request to repair dams, there are 50 counties listed, and it will cost tens of millions to repair the leaks. A group of elders said that the great floods in Daoguang Wushen and Jiyou, if the embankments that have collapsed this year are not repaired, will repeat the mistakes of the Daoguang era. Thinking of the future, we cannot help but shudder. We only hope that the benevolent and righteous people in various provinces and ports will spread the word, develop compassion, pity these survivors, and lead them to the shore, encourage them to donate, beg for help, and collect cheap springs and collect righteous grains. The saying goes, doing good deeds has blessings, and doing good deeds brings auspiciousness. At this time of renewal of the old year, we hope to spread the warmth of spring and gather a sum of money to save a part of the people. Donate one yuan more, and save one more life. Accumulate good deeds and have remaining blessings, and may good intentions prolong life. The disaster victims are grateful to the world, and the colleagues are also eager to help. If the fundraising is successful, it will still be remitted to the Wuhan General Chamber of Commerce and received by this committee. The receipt will be sent at any time and compiled and published for public information. Hubei Flood Relief Committee, He Chengjun and others.</p>

<h3>Southwest Executive Department Established in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>Military and Political Committees Established Simultaneously</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence - This year's New Year's Day, because of the national crisis, the Nanjing National Government issued an order to stop the celebration. However, the Guangzhou Central Provincial and Municipal Party Departments held a New Year's Day group worship ceremony in the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall. Military and political authorities also held a large review in Yantang, and the situation was very enthusiastic. At the same time, three institutions were established: the Southwest Executive Department of the Fourth Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang, the Southwest Military Commission of the National Government, and the Southwest Political Affairs Committee. At about 9:00 AM that morning, a meeting was first held in the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall. More than 800 people attended, including Chen Jitang, Bai Chongxi, Tang Shaoyi, Xiao Focheng, Deng Zheru, Yu Hanmou, Lin Zhimian, Chen Rong, Li Yangjing, Liu Jiwen, Luo Yiqun, Yang Xiji, Wu Shangying, and officials from various military and political institutions. Tang Shaoyi presided over the meeting. After the ceremony, Xiao Focheng reported on the significance of the 21st year of the Republic of China, and said that the Central Government and the National Government should also announce their end today according to Ma and Ma's telegrams. However, after the end, they should also carry out the work of eliminating the Communist bandits, consolidating national defense, and promoting local autonomy, based on the proposals of Mr. Hu Zhantang, Mr. Sun Zhesheng, and Mr. Wu Chaoshu at the Fourth Plenary Session. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a Central Executive Department, Political Affairs Committee, and Military Commission in Guangdong today to engage in the suppression of the Communist bandits, consolidation of national defense, and promotion of autonomy. The significance of today's establishment is even greater and more celebratory. Brothers often feel that Chinese people have a habit that every New Year, they must say good words and auspicious words, such as "Happy New Year" and "Everything Goes Well", and such as New Year couplets, they often write "San Yuan Kaitai Everything is Renewed" and "Good Weather, National Peace and People's Security" and other words, although they belong to the empty talk of the old people, but in the final analysis, there is also something to be taken, such as "Everything Goes Well", that is, every citizen has the happiness of freedom and equality, "Everything is Renewed", that is, the Republic of China has achieved the goal of a lifetime, and the country is peaceful and the people are safe. Today is the New Year's Day, and I have a word to say to all comrades, that is, in this most serious situation, we must have the fighting spirit of the Prime Minister, unite sincerely, and take on the Prime Minister's responsibility of saving the country and the people. Then, we will not fail the Prime Minister's trust, and we will not fail the people's expectations. That is the meaning of today's memorial. After the report, the group worship ceremony was held, and each other bowed. After the group worship was completed, the swearing-in ceremony of the three institutions was held immediately. The person swearing read the oath with his right hand raised, and all the committee members present served as witnesses. After the swearing, slogans were shouted, photos were taken, and a tea party was held to disperse. In the afternoon, they went to Yantang to hold a large review to show celebration.</p>
<p>The three institutions started working on the 4th. The list of candidates for committee members who have been announced is as follows: 1. Hu Hanmin, Chen Jitang, Bai Chongxi, Liu Jiwen, Chen Ce, and Li Yangjing are the six standing committee members of the Southwest Executive Department of the Central Executive Committee.

<h3>Anti-Japanese Demonstration Held by Hunan Students</h3>
<p>Fourth Route Army Generals Telegraph Request to Punish Japan</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Since the fall of Jinzhou, the bad news has spread, and the 30 million people of Hunan are extremely indignant. They have telegraphed leaders such as Chiang, Wang, and Hu one after another, requesting them to go to Beijing as soon as possible to jointly face the national crisis. The Hunan Student Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association also gathered students from various schools at the Provincial Education Association Square this morning (the 6th) to hold a solemn and enthusiastic street demonstration rally. More than 50 schools participated, with about 20,000 people. After the ceremony, Chairman Huang Dingqing first reported the purpose of the meeting, and then proposed various petition items for discussion. As a result, the entire body passed the following resolutions: 1. Request He Jian to implement the proposal to the Fourth Plenary Session, to recover lost territory by force, and to jointly telegraph the National Government with military and political leaders across the country, ordering a general mobilization; 2. Oppose all local organizations; 3. Jointly telegraph the whole country, requesting Wang, Chiang, and Hu to go to Beijing in the near future to preside over the party, government, and military affairs; 4. The whole country should unite to resist Japan; 5. Support the national salvation government; 6. Request the issuance of firearms to students of various schools, and a nationwide general mobilization to depart for the Northeast; 7. Request He Jian to rectify provincial administration. After the decision, Tan Changkai of the Provincial Party Committee, Yao Xuehuai of the Municipal Party Committee, and others successively delivered speeches, hoping that everyone would unite, work hard, and jointly face the national crisis to save the country from danger. After the speeches, they lined up and set off to Dongchang Street and Limen Street, to the Fourth Route Army Headquarters, where they submitted the petition. He Jian personally came out to reply, expressing acceptance. After leaving the General Headquarters, they passed through Ganziyuan, Qingshi Bridge, Denglong Street, Huangdao Street, Nanzheng Street, to the Provincial Government to petition. Secretary-General Yi Zhuzhu received them and promised to forward the petition for implementation. Then they left the Provincial Government, passed through Sijinwan, Zhuanpozi Street, Hongpailou, Bajiaoting, Zoumalou, Nanyang Street, Fuzheng Street, Lao Zhaobi, Youyicun, and returned to the Education Association Square to disband the meeting, which was already 2:00 PM.</p>
<p>The generals of He Jian's Fourth Route Army were also extremely indignant at the Japanese atrocities. They telegraphed the Central Government, requesting an early decision and the determination of a major plan, and declared that their troops were fully armed and awaiting orders. The original telegram is as follows: "To Chairman Lin of the Nanjing National Government, Premier Sun of the Executive Yuan, Minister He of the Military and Political Affairs Department, and Chief of Staff Zhu Junjian: The violent Japanese have invaded and occupied the eastern provinces for several months. All those with blood and qi are furious. Jian previously made suggestions to the Fourth Plenary Session and party and government leaders, believing that the Sino-Japanese issue must be resolved by force to save the country and survive. Even world peace and international justice cannot rely solely on empty words; we must first defend and strengthen ourselves in order to gain sympathy and shift the argument. It is unexpected that while the people of the country are working hard to unite, the violent Japanese continue to invade. The isolated army in the eastern provinces has been fighting for a long time, with exhausted ammunition and no reinforcements. The bad news has come that Jinzhou has been attacked and captured, and they are driving straight in, shocking Pingjin. The tragic disaster of national subjugation is imminent. I believe that even a trapped beast fights, and with our 400 million descendants of the Yellow Emperor, how can we not rise up and strive to annihilate those island barbarians? Only hesitation and procrastination are the enemies of action. Now that the country is peaceful and unified, there is no room for delay in resisting foreign aggression. The gentlemen of the Central Government, having shouldered the heavy responsibility of saving the country and wiping out humiliation, must have good plans for internal stability and external defense. We should request an early decision and the determination of a major plan, on the one hand, strictly ordering the front line to recover lost territory, and on the other hand, broadly raising funds and equipment to meet the situation. Jian respectfully leads his troops, waiting for dispatch, with a keen sense of patriotism, daring not to choose words. Fully armed and awaiting orders, Fourth Route Army Commander He Jian, 28th Army Commander Liu Jianxu, 15th Division Commander Wang Dongyuan, 16th Division Commander Peng Weiren, 19th Division Commander Li Jue, 59th Division Commander Zhang Ying, 62nd Division Commander Tao Guang, 63rd Division Commander Chen Guangzhong, Newly Compiled 34th Division Commander Chen Quzhen, Xiangqian Border Defense Commander Wang Jialie respectfully kowtow (January 6th)."</p>
<h3>Founding of the Wuhu National Salvation Conference</h3>
<p>Anti-Japanese Association Asks the Central Government to Announce Its Policy Towards Japan</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Various circles in Wuhu, seeing the worsening national situation, are enthusiastically organizing national salvation groups. In addition to the Anti-Japanese Association and the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Federation of various middle schools, there are the National Salvation Iron Blood Corps, the National Salvation Association, and the National Salvation Promotion Association, which hold meetings all day long, each doing its best. Since Mr. Wang Jingwei advocated the organization of the National Salvation Conference, various places have responded one after another. A few days ago, the National Salvation Conference, the National Salvation Association, and the National Salvation Promotion Association, etc., jointly held a meeting at the County Chamber of Commerce to prepare for a merger. Unexpectedly, at the meeting, disputes arose due to overly enthusiastic patriotic emotions, and competition was particularly fierce in electing drafting committee members. Afterwards, the matter was settled, and it was decided to merge and jointly form the Anhui Wuhu Promotion Association of the National Salvation Conference, with five standing committee members and twenty-one committee members, scheduled to be announced on the 13th. The County Anti-Japanese Association, due to the fact that our army in Jinzhou retreated without resistance, handing it over to the Japanese bandits, specially telegraphed the Central National Government and the Foreign Affairs Department today, requesting the rapid dispatch of troops to implement the recovery of lost territory by force, and requesting the immediate announcement of the policy towards Japan to comfort the people. The original telegram is as follows: "To the Nanjing Central Party Department, the National Government, the Special Foreign Affairs Committee, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: The Eastern atmosphere is increasingly severe, and the national dignity is lost. The news of the fall of Jinzhou brings tears and blood. Now that our new government is established and reorganized, we hope to save the tide and devise a plan to defend against national disasters. However, the fact of resistance has not appeared, and the plan to kill the enemy has not been heard. This association, with the duty of opposing Japan and sharing the enemy's hatred, witnesses the situation with a heavy heart and bears the responsibility for the rise and fall of the nation. Therefore, we fear the danger of an overturned nest and eggs and extend the righteousness of hair disheveled in anxiety. Now, after the eighth standing committee meeting, it is decided to telegraph a request to publicly announce the policy towards Japan and inform the people of the country to relieve public expectations. At this critical moment, when the national situation is in danger, relying on the League of Nations will lead nowhere. The survival of the nation can only be decided by ourselves. We earnestly request the unified dispatch of a large army to march north on a specific date to return our rivers and mountains and avenge our national humiliation. With incense and washing, we await the sending-off banners, and with simple meals and pot-filled drinks, we are willing to be the rearguard. In tears, we send this telegram, hastily choosing words. In addition to sending separate telegrams, we respectfully report this to you. Please consider it."</p>
<h3>Joint Suppression of Bandits in Huangpi by Land and Air Forces</h3>
<p>The Bandits Claim 40,000, but in Reality, There Are Only Over 10,000</p>
<p>Troops from the Xu and Xia Divisions Are Blocking at the Front Line</p>
<p>The Pinghan Railway Is Still Peaceful and Vehicles Pass as Usual</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The Xiaodian, Hekou, and Changxuanling areas in the northern part of Huangpi County have long been bandit dens. Because they have not launched a large-scale invasion to the south, people have generally taken it lightly. After Li Mingzhong was appointed as the Pacification Commissioner of the Henan-Anhui-Hubei Border Area, the county was划into the defense zone, and the Commissioner's Office was also set up there. The people, with a large army stationed there, were even more fearless. Unexpectedly, after the fall of Huang'an on the 22nd of last month, Kuang Jixun joined forces with the bandits in the northern part of Huangpi County with three divisions and one brigade, invading southward in successive waves, and their momentum was almost unstoppable. The county seat of Huangpi was also in imminent danger. The place is only more than 60 miles away from Hankou. If Huangpi is not defended, the bandits can reach the border of Hankou directly in half a day. The citizens are in fear and anxiety, informing each other in panic. After the reporter investigated various parties, it was learned that the bandits were still five miles away from the county seat of Huangpi. Although the bandits claimed to have 40,000 troops, there were only over 10,000 in reality. There were not enough rifles, only several thousand, and ammunition was very scarce. There was also an airplane, named Liewu, but because there were no bombs, it was only used for reconnaissance. The leader, a certain Ouyang, was also quite fierce. Kuang himself was still unknown where he was. The government troops who advanced to suppress the bandits included two regiments of Xiao Zhichu's 44th Division, two regiments of Xia Douyin's 13th Division, one brigade and two regiments of Xu Tingyao's 4th Division, and two regiments of Ge Yunlong's 33rd Division. The Xia troops set off from Qijiawan, and the Xu troops set off from Hankou, and both had rushed to the front line, engaging in fierce battles with the bandits for several days. The Ge troops were stationed in the county seat, and the Xiao troops were stationed to defend the railway, encircling the bandits in an arc. The Hubei Pacification Commissioner's Office also ordered the 4th Aviation Team to dispatch two combat aircraft, Douglass and Morse, carrying heavy bombs, to assist in the suppression. On the 6th and 7th, the two aircraft dropped many bombs in the vicinity of Huangpi and the bandit nests in Huang'an, killing many bandits. According to reports, the bandit's momentum would not expand. As for the situation of the fierce battle in the front, no detailed reports have been received here. However, according to the military telegrams and the reports from people in Huangpi, the government troops have indeed succeeded, and the bandit's momentum is gradually weakening. The county seat of Huangpi is very solid, because the Xu and Xia divisions are both elite troops, and even if the bandits are brave, they will not be able to cross the Leichi Lake one step. As for the traffic on the southern section of the Pinghan Railway, it is maintained by the Xiao Zhichu troops. Xiao himself stayed in Hankou due to illness. Fearing that the bandit's momentum would disrupt the railway, he telegraphed Hua Wenxuan, the deputy commander of the division, to pay special attention. On the 7th, he received a reply telegram from Hua, saying that troops had been dispatched to Wangjiadian, Zhujiawan, Sanchabu, and other places for defense, and the traffic was extremely safe. Combining the news from various sources, Huangpi is not in any danger, and the people here are gradually settling down. However, the disaster victims from various places who have been fleeing to Hankou in recent days are shoulder to shoulder. Three days ago, there were only more than 100,000 people, but on the 7th, it had increased to 300,000. The Garrison Command, fearing that bandits might be mixed in, has strictly ordered its subordinates to conduct thorough investigations, especially paying attention to the disaster victims in Huangpi, so as to prevent bandits from destroying the security of Wuhan.

<h3>Bandit Forces in Fujian, Jiangxi, and Guangdong Borders Still Fierce</h3>
<p>Many Refugees Flee to Guangdong Province</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: After the Red Bandits of southern Jiangxi, Peng, Dian, Zhu, Li, and other groups, captured Huichang, the people on the Fujian-Jiangxi border followed the militia and moved into the Fujian-Guangdong border. Ouyang Xin, the chairman of the Huichang Local Maintenance Association, went to Xitouxu in Wuping, recruited troops, and obtained three large teams, which were merged into the Ministry of Zhong Wencai in western Fujian to continue resisting the bandits. The militia of Huichang, Ruijin, Anyuan, Xunwu, and Yudu counties retreated to the Pingyuan County area on the Guangdong border due to the strength of the Red Bandits, while the refugees supported the old and carried the young, fleeing to Guangdong. The Jiangxi militia jointly elected Xie Jiayou as the commander-in-chief and Ouyang Jiang as the deputy commander-in-chief, and set up a temporary bandit suppression headquarters office in Niudouguang on the Xunping border. Xie had old grudges with Zhong Wencai of Wuping, and it was a pity that they could not cooperate in suppressing the bandits at this time. Also, Ouyang Xin arrived in Shantou yesterday to ask the Second Division Headquarters for assistance in funding and ammunition. Xie Jiayou also sent personnel to Shantou to ask for assistance after taking office as the bandit suppression officer in Niudouguang. Commander Zhang, believing that the Jiangxi bandits were rampant and intended to break into the Fujian-Guangdong border, allocated a large amount of ammunition and distributed it to Zhang Ying's camp in Pingyuan and the Jiangxi militia for replenishment. At present, the entire territory of Pingyuan is still very peaceful, but Jiaoling County is showing signs of unrest. Many villagers moved to the county seat, and the teachers and students of the school were scattered. In addition, Yongding County in Fujian Province, since it was captured by the Red Bandit Zhang Dingcheng, almost the entire county has become a Red area. The bandit then spied on Dabu and advanced to Fengshi, using seven civilian boats to cross the river. Fortunately, they were repelled by the militia. The troops stationed in Dabu, He Yuguang and Liang Ruogu, prepared to send teams into Fujian to suppress the bandits because the Red Bandits often invaded. Also, the 2,000 Red Bandits of Peng Dehuai's Ministry in southern Jiangxi harassed Guikengxu and Dayang Bridge in Wuping. Zhong Qiangui's Newly Compiled Independent First Brigade of the Guangdong Army advanced to block and suppress them. They fought fiercely with the bandits in Guikeng for three hours. The bandits were almost wiped out, and four water machine guns and more than a hundred rifles were captured. Sixty-six Red Bandits were captured alive, and more than a hundred bandits were killed. The bandits fled to Junmenling, so the county was not disturbed by the Red Bandits, which was also fortunate among misfortunes.</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Five Robberies in Wuku During the night of the 6th, at about 12 o'clock, four or five bandits, speaking in a strong Ke dialect and with painted faces, suddenly came to the house of Shen Shuqin, the local security officer of the Taojiazhujia in Wuku Twenty-fifth Tu, broke into the gate, robbed clothes and hats, and also robbed the house of Shen Shutang, who lived with them. His son was about to get married, and he was hiring workers to sew clothes. A piece of woolen cloth, thirty-five pearls, and sixty yuan in cash were robbed. They carried the loot and left. It is said that four other families were robbed at the same time, but because the losses were not much, none of them reported the case. On the same night, the Yinzhuangs Yinxiang and Yinshun houses in Wuku's Zhujiazhujia were also robbed of their clothes by bandits. In addition, Wu Pintang's young son of Wu Jiazhujia was kidnapped before, and recently redeemed for more than 2,000 yuan.

<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Robbery Cases Occur Frequently in the Four Townships On the night of the 3rd of this month, at 11:00 PM, more than ten bandits suddenly came to the house of Shi Rensheng, a merchant in Yinjiaqiaoan, Hongqiao Township, Fuan Township, the 17th District of the county. Each of them held凶器, pried open the back door and entered. First, they tied up the men and women of the Shi family, and then they rummaged through boxes and cabinets, looting wildly. They were robbed of twenty dans of white glutinous rice, one stone of glutinous rice, and clothes and other items, with a huge loss. After the bandits got the loot, they howled and fled. Also, on the night of the 4th, at about 10:00 PM, the house of Yuan Sanbao in Shengxiang Shang, Taiping Township, near Houqiao Town, the 9th District (Beishang Township), was also attacked by more than ten bandits, who broke into the room and robbed eight stones of white rice, one can of kerosene, five yuan of banknotes, four cotton quilts, one leather jacket, and more than thirty silk and cloth clothes. Also, on the night of the 4th, the house of Hui Amo in Huixiang Shang, Huaixia City, the 8th District, was also suddenly attacked by more than ten bandits who entered the house to commit robbery. When Amo saw this, he immediately beat the gong to raise the alarm. The 28th Detachment of the Anzhen Chamber of Commerce learned of the report and immediately sent team members to rush to arrest them. When they arrived about half a mile away from Huixiang Shang, team member Chen Jinbiao fired a gun into the sky as a warning. Unexpectedly, the barrel of the gun suddenly exploded, injuring his left hand. Yesterday, he came to the city and went to the Labor Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Frequent Fire Alarms Inside and Outside the City Next to the Qianfeng Silk Factory on Liangxi Road outside Guangfu Gate, the house of Hu Jinbao, a蓬户, caught fire at about 11:00 PM on the 6th due to carelessness with fire. Suddenly, thick smoke filled the air and冒穿屋頂. At that time, the northwest wind was strong, and the fire became more intense, spreading to eight neighboring蓬户s such as Zuo Ada, Zhu Jinchang, and Zuo Jintang. Later, the fire brigades from various sections drove their dragons to the scene and tried their best to extinguish the fire before it was extinguished. Also, the Shenhetang mounting shop on Dashiqiao East Street in the city also suddenly reported a fire a few days ago, burning down the building three up and three down, with a loss of more than 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Bandits Kidnap and Extort Huge Sums of Money Qian Xiongmao, the owner of Qian Yongmao Nanhuo Store in Yangshuyuan Town, the 16th District (Wan'an City), went out to collect accounts with his servants on December 18th of last year. On the way, he was kidnapped by five or six bandits in Kuangqiao, the locality of the district, and there has been no news since then. However, it is now learned that Qian's servants were suddenly released from the bandit's den a few days ago, and brought back a letter from the bandits, demanding 300,000 yuan for the ransom. After reading the letter, the Qian family was shocked. Because the family property is not worth 10,000 yuan, where can such a huge sum of money come from? There is still no suitable solution. At the same time, Chen Dingbo, a resident of Yangjian Town, the 8th District, also received a threatening letter from bandits, extorting a huge sum of money. After receiving the letter, Chen reported it to the 16th Branch of the Public Security Bureau in charge. Shen, the branch chief, reported it to the headquarters yesterday and ordered a strict search for the bandits and bring them to justice.</p>

<p>The Xushi Security Corps Cracks Another Theft Case The big town of Xushi in the county has a branch of the Xushi Security Corps stationed there. At around 6:00 AM on the 7th, the guard at the branch saw six passers-by whose actions were suspicious and who had bloodstains on their bodies. The corps members immediately stepped forward to question them, but they were evasive. They were immediately twisted to the branch, and a telephone was used to notify the headquarters of the Security Corps of the Xushi District Office. A cadre was sent to Dahe Town to pick them up. Chief Inspector Zeng of the Public Security Bureau interrogated them in the District Office. According to their confessions, one was Xue Laosan, one was Chen Donghe, one was Liu Binwu, one was Feng Caijin, one was Cao Agen, and one was Zhou Abao. Except for Zhou Abao, the others denied any illegal acts. After repeated questioning, Zhou confessed that he and Xue Laosan and others took the Xiban ship to Lujiaqiao on the 6th of this month. In the evening, they went to a farmer's house to rob, but the neighbors heard about it and came to surround and arrest them. They waded through the water to escape, but fell all the way, so their bodies were stained with blood. They were arrested in Dahe. A search of the six men found no weapons. As a result, the case was a theft case, and it was decided to transfer it to the County Public Security Bureau on the 8th.</p>

<p>Detective Captain of the Water Patrol Team Arrested According to a secret report from the villagers of Dongxiang to the county police team, Zhu Yuanchen, the detective captain of the water patrol team, is the son of Zhu Xiao, a famous bandit. When Yin Bandit was entrenched in Tuotuo last autumn, he was also inside as a fake battalion commander of the World's First Army, and was wanted by the Provincial Government and the Bao应 County Government.

<h3>Zhou Fo-hai, Director of Education of Jiangsu Province, Proposes</h3>
<p>Solutions to Educational Funding Problems</p>
<p>"Provincial Committee Yesterday Passed the Suspension of Payment of Assistance Fees to Central University</p>
<p>Educational Funding Committee Scheduled to Hold Meeting</p>
<p>Zhou Fo-hai, the new Director of Education of Jiangsu Province, has been in office for several days. The reporter paid a special visit yesterday, and the following is a record of his conversation: (Question) When will the Director hold the inaugural ceremony? (Answer) It needs to be reported to the Provincial Government. (Question) It has been reported recently that Jiangsu schools have an organization to demand salaries. What policies are there for the future educational funding problems in Jiangsu? (Answer) The purpose and scope of the salary demand plan is only for the salaries of teachers and staff, which is not a fundamental problem. I am now planning to propose to the Provincial Government to seek a fundamental solution to educational funding. If it is only for salaries, even if it is resolved temporarily, it is not a permanent solution. (Then he showed the reporter the proposal). (Question) It is said that the Educational Funding Management Committee will hold a meeting soon. Is there a fixed date? (Answer) It will be held around the 12th. Wu Zhilao and Niu Tilao have both sent letters promising to attend at that time.</p>
<p>Zhou Fo-hai Proposes to the Provincial Government</p>
<p>Zhenjiang, 8th Electric News: Zhou Fo-hai proposed to the Provincial Government to suspend the payment of Central University's assistance funds from January of the 21st to allocate all of them to the educational funds of Jiangsu Province. It was passed at the Provincial Committee meeting on the 8th.</p>
<p>Zhou Fo-hai's proposal to the Provincial Government is as follows: The educational funding of this province is extremely tight and has reached its limit. It is proposed to forward it to the two ministries of Finance and Education, and refer to the method of allocating funds to Wuhan University from the national tax revenue within Hubei Province. All the funds of Central University should be allocated from the cigarette tax revenue within Jiangsu Province in full. In the future, all the income of the Jiangsu Educational Funding Management Office should be allocated to the educational undertakings of the province. Is it appropriate? Please make a public decision. Committee member and Director of Education Zhou Fo-hai proposed: It is found that the funding for the National Central University was previously stipulated by the Central Government to be allocated from the educational funding of Jiangsu Province at 1.32 million yuan per year to offset the expenditure. Over the years, the Jiangsu Educational Funding Management Office has tried its best to bear the burden, but due to the vastness of the provincial educational undertakings and the shortage of funding sources, the income and expenditure of provincial educational funding are not in balance, and there is a deficit every year. The educational funding of Jiangsu Province has always relied on the special cigarette tax as a major and reliable source of income. Previously, the Central Government resolved to transfer the special tax revenue to the Central Government and designated 1.8 million yuan to be allocated from the land tax revenue of Jiangsu to offset the deficit. When the income is insufficient, the Ministry of Finance will still allocate the full amount from the cigarette tax. However, because the land tax income varies from year to year, and the collecting agencies often embezzle educational funds and arbitrarily reduce the amount when responding to the Ministry of Finance's requests for funds, the amount of the special land tax funds underpaid from the 16th to the 19th year reached more than 2 million yuan. Repeatedly requested the Ministry of Finance to fulfill the previous agreement and allocate the full amount from the cigarette tax revenue, but it has not been implemented. As a result, the income and expenditure of the Jiangsu Educational Funding Office in the past three or four years have increased year by year. This year, the famine has spread throughout the province, and the income has been further reduced. It is estimated that the total annual income and expenditure, together with</p>
<h3>Zhou Fohai, Director of Education for Jiangsu Province</h3>
<p>The previous deficit of nearly three million yuan, coupled with the recent accumulation of debts for various agency expenses, has left the management office utterly impoverished. If relief is not swiftly sought, the funding for National Central University will undoubtedly become unsustainable, and the educational endeavors of the province will also grind to a halt. Previously, we received the Central Government's promulgated budget regulations for the 19th year of the Republic trial implementation and the budget management standards issued last November, which clearly delineate the boundaries between national and local revenue and expenditure. The sources of Jiangsu Province's educational funding, namely the land tax and the slaughter tax, are classified as local revenue according to the classification standards. Meanwhile, the funding for national universities should be classified as national expenditure. Using local revenue to support national expenditure was acceptable when local finances were relatively abundant and had surplus capacity. However, the educational finances of this province have reached a point of exhaustion. If we are forced to bear this enormous expenditure, bankruptcy is imminent. At that time, National Central University and the provincial educational institutions will inevitably meet their demise. Fohai, having been appointed to oversee the entire province's education, from the very beginning of his tenure, recognizing the urgent need to stabilize funding for Jiangsu's education in order to establish a foundation for its endeavors, and also acknowledging that National Central University, as the nation's highest institution of learning, should be strongly supported, proposes to request that the Ministries of Finance and Education be consulted to follow the precedent of Wuhan University, where funding is allocated from Hubei's national tax revenue. All funding for National Central University should be designated from Jiangsu's cigarette tax revenue and allocated in full. Subsequently, all revenue of the Jiangsu Provincial Education Funding Management Office will be used to fully fund provincial educational affairs. This way, the funding for National Central University can be secured, and the deficit in provincial school funding can be more easily addressed. Your decision on the appropriateness of this proposal is respectfully requested.</p>
<p>Representatives of Middle School Teachers' Associations</p>
<p>Gathering to Participate in Salary Demand Conference</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial United Association of Middle School Teachers and Staff is scheduled to hold a salary demand conference at Zhenjiang Middle School on the 11th of this month. Representatives from various schools have already been reporting in one after another. Those from remote areas such as Donghai, Suqian, and Xuzhou have already arrived in Zhenjiang. Representatives from areas such as Huai'an, Tongzhou, and Songjiang have also set off one after another. They all believe that the provincial schools' funding has been in arrears for nearly four months, and the past suffering has become unbearable. Therefore, the association has no choice but to conduct a solemn discussion in advance to seek a thorough resolution to the issue of educational funding.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Middle School Principals Urge Students to Resume Classes</h3>
<p>Zhenjiang, 1st – The principals of Jiangsu provincial middle schools have jointly published a letter urging all middle school students in the province to resume classes. The letter is two thousand words long.</p>
<h3>No Need to Correct Confucius' Birthday</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education replied to the Executive Yuan, stating that the Ministry of Education will continue to designate the 27th day of the eighth month of the solar calendar as Confucius' Birthday Memorial Day, and there is no need to correct it. The letter responded to the Executive Yuan's secretariat, stating: "Regarding the Hunan Provincial Government's submission from the Director of the Guiding County Education Bureau, requesting a correction of Confucius' Birthday to emphasize commemoration and facilitate sacrifices, which was forwarded by the Ministry for investigation, along with a copy of the original submission. The original Confucius' Birthday Memorial Day was set as the 27th day of the eighth month of the lunar calendar. In December of the 17th year of the Republic, the Ministry, considering that the National Government was promoting the solar calendar and the lunar calendar was inconvenient to use, requested the Academia Sinica to calculate the corresponding date in the Gregorian calendar for the 17th day of the eighth month of the lunar calendar in the 21st year of the reign of King Zhao of Zhou. The Executive Yuan's eighth meeting resolved that Confucius' Birthday Memorial should be set as the 27th day of the eighth month of the solar calendar, and the Ministry followed this resolution and promulgated it. For several years, there has been no perceived inconvenience. Furthermore, converting lunar dates to solar dates is not unique to Confucius' Birthday Memorial; the Martyrs' Day commemorating the Seventy-Two Martyrs and the Lantern Festival and Dragon Boat Festival, which are based on the lunar calendar, are also replaced with the same month and day in the solar calendar. Although this does not match the original dates, the people have not found it awkward. In addition, the Ministry's revised regulations for the school year, semesters, and holidays stipulate that elementary schools' summer vacation starts on July 3rd and ends on August 21st, middle schools' summer vacation starts on June 30th and ends on August 24th, and colleges and universities' summer vacation starts on June 23rd and ends on August 31st. Therefore, on August 27th of the solar calendar, elementary and middle schools have already started, and although colleges and universities have not yet started, the start of the semester is near, and most teachers and staff have returned to school. The original submission's claim that schools are mostly empty during the summer vacation does not align with the facts. Based on the above reasons, the Ministry believes that there is no need to correct Confucius' Birthday Memorial Day. Your review and further instructions are respectfully requested."</p>

<h3>China Physical Education College Moves Location</h3>
<p>China Physical Education School is the earliest established physical education school in China, with a long history and many graduates. It is now in its 37th session. After Gu Zheng, a Boy Scout expert, came to the school two years ago, he established a naval and army Boy Scout trainer course, and three sessions have already graduated. Due to the increasing number of students, the original school buildings were not sufficient. Over ten Western-style houses have been purchased on Xiangyin Road in Jiangwan to serve as school buildings, which can accommodate hundreds of students. The location is spacious, the environment is excellent, and it is very suitable for the facilities of a physical education school. Moreover, the Baoshan Road bus provides direct access, making transportation very convenient. It is said that the enrollment is quite strict. The new semester will begin with classes in the new buildings.</p>

<p>Pirates Besiege MacLane</p>

Their offense featured outstanding surprise troops, and every shot was accurate. Their defense was seamless, making it difficult to penetrate. With Irving heavily guarded by Er, it was difficult for him to get the ball. Lao Ai relied on long-range shots several times and scored several points. Brown paled in comparison and could not stand against the enemy. The Pirates were all talented generals, composed and methodical, truly displaying championship qualities. The largest point difference in the first half was 17-4. The Pirates won the first half 24-9. In the second half, MacLane was still at a loss. The Pirates led 31-16 before adjusting their troops and resting. The final score was 35-24. Referees were Shu Hong and Qu Hongren.</p>

<h3>New Korean Track and Field Records for 1931</h3>
<p>The downfall of Korea was not due to the weakness of its people, but rather due to its past political corruption and factional strife. Its national physique is indeed stronger than that of our people. Looking at the Korean track and field records of last year, a total of nine were updated. The astonishing achievements are beyond our expectations. Among them, Kim Eun-bae's marathon broke the world record. Zhang Xingxian's intermediate hurdles and Liu Yuehan's discus throw are comparable to Japanese records. The remaining items are also beyond our reach. Even Koreans from a fallen nation have this perseverance and spirit. What should we, the Chinese, do? The new records announced by the Koreans last year are as follows:</p>
<p>Event/Record/Holder</p>
<p>Long Jump/7.01 meters/Lee Young-hyun</p>
<p>Triple Jump/14.42 meters/Lee Young-hyun</p>
<p>Discus Throw/42.29 meters/Liu Yuehan</p>
<p>Javelin Throw/55.87 meters/Lu Hyun</p>
<p>10,000 meters/33 minutes 16.6 seconds/Kwon Tae-ha</p>

<h3>Talking About Education From Burning a Coal Stove (Part 1)</h3>
<p>When I was young, I ate ready-made meals cooked by my mother every day. Sometimes I would go to the kitchen to take a look, like a popular graduation tour. I never lifted a finger, so I wasted more than thirty years and simply didn't know what a stove was all about. I saw that my mother could burn it very easily, so I thought it was really easy and that I could do it with just a glance. Why bother to do it myself?</p>
<p>Starting with the belief that I could do it with a glance and ending with a lifetime of not knowing how, I realized this strange thing when I was thirty-five years old. That year, a poor friend was preparing to cook for me for lunch. I volunteered to light the stove for him, but I was badly defeated. He washed and chopped the vegetables, but I hadn't even lit the fire. I had no choice but to give way to the capable and let him take care of everything. He lit the fire in a moment. I asked him the secret, and he said, "To light the stove, you need to use burning charcoal as kindling." Hearing this, I suddenly realized that it contained an important principle. From then on, using advanced students to guide new students became an important method for me over the years.</p>
<p>In 1927, I started to burn a fire a few times. At that time, we used thatch. Thatch is easy to light and easy to extinguish. As soon as it lights, it bursts into a ball of fire and turns into ashes. I put bundles of thatch into the stove, and I couldn't leave for a moment. If I left, the fire would go out. You have to keep sending thatch in to maintain the flame. Burning thatch is such a waste of energy!</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Records of Peculiar Surnames</h3>
<p>— Cicada Shedding</p>
<p>The Shen Bao's local news on the 30th contains a list of names of the All-China Islamic representatives going to India to pay homage to the Kaaba, including Mai Cheng-zhang, Shi Yu, and Cheng San. Aren't these two surnames, Mai and Shi, very peculiar? When I was at the Pukou Weighing and Inspection Bureau, there was a Mai Qiu-fan, who was from Jiayu County, Hubei Province. According to Qiu-fan, "There are only two branches of the Mai surname in all of China: one in Nanjing and one in Jiayu. As for how the Mai surname originated, it was around the Sui and Tang dynasties, when people from U-Tsang moved to Ningxia in China." According to the U-Tsang route, business was very prosperous during the Sui and Tang dynasties. The Tang Dynasty monk Xuanzang went to India to study Buddhism and reached India via U-Tsang. The Mai surname in Nanjing is quite wealthy and has always started from business since generations ago. "Notes from the Small Sky Juniper Hall" states, "There was a Huai Army commander named Zhe Gui. When he first joined the army, people asked for his surname, and he said, 'I have no surname.' He was a beggar on the streets who lost his parents when he was young, so he didn't know his surname. Later, he accumulated merit and was promoted to a recorded Brigadier General. When the memorial was being drafted, Hefei asked him, but he also said that he didn't know his surname. Hefei said, 'How can a general have no surname?' The commander asked Hefei to give him a surname. Hefei was reading official documents and said, 'You can recognize a word,' pointing to the word 'Zhe' in 'Respectfully Report.' Therefore, he took this as his surname." According to the notes, the surname Zhe came about through recognition, and there is no such surname in the "Book of Ten Thousand Surnames." However, I remember that when my uncle Shengjie, the censor, was inspecting the southern city, he was ordered to investigate those in charge. All officials and servants had to drink a cup of wine and smoke a tube of tobacco before they could perform their duties. At that time, there was a yamen runner named Zhe Biao, who saw that everyone else had a fearful expression. Zhe Biao stepped forward and drank three large cups of wine because Zhe Biao was a famous drunkard. For these few days, he had no money to buy wine, and his enthusiasm was ignited. He drank the official wine to his heart's content. Also, there was a runner named Zhe Biao in Wu County, Suzhou. When Sai Jinhua was exiled to Wu County, the local officials were ordered to keep her under strict surveillance. Zhe Biao was the runner in charge of surveillance. However, Sai Jinhua was replaced by someone else at the time of her exile. At that time, Zhe of Wu County was Li Zi'ao. Li was from Sichuan and had a marital relationship with my family. One day, he was drunk and incited Zi'ao to summon Sai Jinhua to the case for inspection. My initial intention was just a playful gesture. Who would have thought that the Sai Jinhua who arrived was a substitute? Zi'ao was furious and severely punished Zhe Biao, ordering him to hand over the original person. At that time, Sai Jinhua was already in Shanghai. Hearing that this move was at my instigation, she came to my residence to ask me what I thought. I got to know Sai Jinhua's true face and met this leader of Jianghu heroes. I then wrote a letter to Zi'ao to exonerate him. Later, I moved my home to the Dragon Prestige Cave in Taihu, only to realize that Zhe Biao's power was not to be insulted. Now that I see the Zhe surname in the Shen Bao as a large Islamic surname, it is possible that the Zhe Gui in "Notes from the Small Juniper Hall" is a mistake in the transmission. Also, "Good Friend Magazine" has Lao Yanruo, a Chinese manufacturer, with the "Lao" surname which is also very peculiar, so I am appending it here.</p>
<h3>World Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Haike</p>
<p>Two Great Thieves: There is a French master car thief named Camille Debauche. According to his own account, he stole as many as 307 cars in three years. His calm demeanor is truly astonishing. Once, he stole a car on a main street in Paris and drove away at full speed. Unexpectedly, someone saw him and gave chase. Later, at an intersection, he was blocked by countless vehicles and could no longer escape. Helpless, he stopped the engine, draped his coat over one arm, and stood by the car. He immediately told the police officer that the car thief had run away, and since he saw no one in the car, he was guarding it on behalf of the owner until it could be handed over to the police station. The police officer even raised his hand in salute to him, never knowing that he was the car thief himself. America also has a great thief named George Dlkinson. He came from a wealthy family and did not worry about food or clothing. During the day, he worked as a clerk in a shirt factory, but in the evenings, for excitement, he would go out and commit theft. Every week, he would go out four or five times to lead his life as a burglar. He was eventually arrested and it was proven that he had broken into seventy homes in nine months. Countless jewels and precious objects were found in his residence. Such a fine person, why become a thief? It's truly incredible.</p>
<h3>Correction of "Qiu Shuyuan at the Time of the Cession of Taiwan"</h3>
<p>— Liu Shimu</p>
<p>The Northeast is difficult; the barbarian cavalry roams unchecked. The Black River freezes over, causing deep pain in the fields. People with conscience are constantly worried, thinking of ways to strengthen the nation and recover the land. This publication has been collecting stories of our country's past virtuous and heroic figures defending against invaders, to encourage the weak and boost morale. Readers are all deeply moved, wishing they could draw their bows and follow suit. However, the article "Qiu Shuyuan at the Time of the Cession of Taiwan" published on the 27th of last month confuses things, and needs to be corrected. Upon investigation, the "Qiu Shuyuan at the Time of the Cession of Taiwan" article contains all the achievements of Mr. Qiu Fengjia's life. Qiu Fengjia, styled Xian'gen, also known as Canghai and Nanwushanren, was a native of Jiaoling County, Guangdong (formerly Zhenping). His life's deeds are as described in the article: bravely facing national crises, and writing poetry in his later years. His "Lingyun Hairi Lou Poetry Collection" in twelve volumes, was published in the autumn of the second year of the Republic of China, one year after Mr. Fengjia passed away. Mr. Qiu Shuyuan, styled Wei, is a native of Haicheng, Fujian. Although he corresponded with Mr. Fengjia, they never met. Furthermore, he is still alive and resides in Singapore in Southeast Asia. Last year, he served as the editor of the supplement of the Singapore Daily News. Mr. Shuyuan and I are close friends, and we communicate frequently. Mr. Wang Shengzhi, the leader of the Malayan athletes who came to Shanghai last month, is Mr. Shuyuan's worthy son-in-law. Mr. Shuyuan wrote "Five Hundred Stone Cave Heaven Writings" in twelve volumes, published in the twenty-fifth year of Guangxu. His writings and morals are enough to influence the world. However, his poetry and prose do not mention Taiwan. It should be known that he has never set foot on Taiwan. I saw Mr. Fengjia once at my father's residence when I was young. With national crises at hand, reading his works brings back memories. The wise man has passed away, when will we wield our spears again? I cannot help but shed tears. I wonder what Mr. Shuyuan will think when he reads this.</p>
<p>(Note) The deeds of Qiu Fengjia can be found in Qiu Shuyuan's "Five Hundred Stone Cave Heaven Writings," Volume 3, pages 3 to 5.</p>
<h3>Record of Names of Martyrs Who Died in the Sino-Japanese War (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Wang Chang</p>
<p>Ding Ruchang, Naval Admiral. In the Battle of the Yalu River that year, almost half of the navy was destroyed. Ruchang gathered the remnants and returned to Weihaiwei. The following year, the enemy attacked Weihai urgently. In the second month, they deployed all their forces at the eastern entrance, repeatedly destroying our ships. The soldiers lacked morale. Ruchang, knowing there was nothing he could do, committed suicide by taking poison.</p>
<p>Liu Buchan, Rear Admiral of the Navy. A native of Houguan. He died from cannon fire (according to the Qing History Museum biography), or by hanging himself, according to another account.</p>
<p>Zhang Wenxuan, General, and Liu Gongang, Military Commander. Both agreed with Ding Ruchang's proposal to perish with the ships. After Ruchang's death, Wenxuan also committed suicide by taking poison. Yang Yonglin, General, styled Yuting. After Weihai fell, Yonglin aimed a pistol at the soft spot in his mouth. The bullet entered his brain, and white pus flowed out of his nostrils, hanging down about a foot. He sat upright and did not fall. The enemy was surprised and thought he was a god. See the biographies of Lin Shu and Xu Jingyan.</p>
<p>Huang Zulian, Commandant, died with Yang Yonglin.</p>
<p>Li Kuiyuan, Commander of the torpedo boat Wang Dengyun. When the Lu Jiaotai fort in Weihai fell, Dengyun fought bravely. Kuiyuan shielded Dengyun with his body and died from a bullet. See Luo Dunrong's "Record of the Destruction of the Weihaiwei Fleet."</p>
<p>Yang Ziyun, Military Assistant in Taiwan to Liu Yongfu. After Taiwan was ceded, the Taiwanese people righteously refused. They planned to defend. The enemy fiercely attacked, but were unsuccessful. Then, treacherous people led them through secret paths, flanking the Taiwanese army. Ziyun fought and slit his throat.</p>
<p>Yuan Xiqing, Commander of the New Chu Army under Li Weiyi. He died in battle at the Dajia River in Tainan.</p>
<p>Wu Pengnian. Pengnian guarded the Dajia River, ambushing and repeatedly defeating the enemy army. Later, after the Dajia River fell, he retreated to Bagua Mountain. The enemy obtained guides from local bandits and attacked. Pengnian fought to the last and died a martyr. Xu Xiang, leader of the righteous people of Tainan. When the enemy attacked the Dajia River, they were defeated by Wu Pengnian and retreated across the river. Xiang set an ambush, attacking them as they were halfway across, annihilating their entire army. Later, he continued to resist, holding out for several months. His army was starving and exhausted. The enemy army then attacked with full force. Xiang fought bravely, always at the front lines. He was eventually killed by cannon fire.</p>
<p>Sun Zitang, son of Sun Kaihua, Admiral of the Fujian Land Forces. His name is missing. Zitang is his courtesy name. He rallied righteous soldiers to resist the enemy. Lacking support, he charged into the enemy lines on horseback, fighting to the death at Sandiao Ridge in Tainan. See the joint biography of the Sun family.</p>
<p>The above are the names of thirty identifiable martyrs. There are countless more whose names are unknown. My knowledge is limited, and I cannot fully commend their loyalty and righteousness. I hope that learned scholars across the country will share their knowledge. I would be most grateful.</p>
<h3>Jottings from the Ocean Seas</h3>
<p>— Yi Zang</p>
<p>Poor Children Occupy Palace: About forty miles outside the capital of Spain, to the west of the Royal Palace of Alfonso, about two hundred impoverished children recently broke into the palace, occupying the imperial dining hall and bedrooms, gathering to play and laugh. Because the palace was unguarded and the Spanish King was residing in another palace, they were able to invade. It is said that the palace is located about forty miles from Madrid, surrounded by verdant mountains and clear streams, with beautiful scenery. This magnificent palace has now become a slum, which is quite amusing.</p>
<p>Queen Rides Third-Class Train: Queen Helen of Romania and Princess Ileana, the Crown Prince, recently traveled to Scotland on a third-class train in London. At the time, they went unnoticed. Later, it was seen that many British royal nobles were boarding the train to see them off, and it was then revealed to be the Queen of Romania. Everyone was amazed and said, "I wanted to see what third-class trains are like, so I took a ride." News reporters rushed to take pictures, but were all rejected. However, the story has already spread throughout London.</p>
<h3>The Louse King</h3>
<p>— Rui Yucheng</p>
<p>My friend Mr. Wang Dingwu, previously served in the military in the Northeast for many years. Among his comrades was a "Louse King" who was quite famous for a time, and who eventually died from lice. The other day, Mr. Wang told me the story of the "Louse King," which was quite bizarre. So, I record it here. According to Mr. Wang, lice are transformed from human essence. They easily breed if the body is dirty, because the essence excreted from the sweat glands of the human body, when not washed away for a long time, transforms into lice. Bathrooms are rare in the north, and washing is inconvenient. Therefore, it is very easy for ordinary people to get lice. But they can be removed in a day and night. The method is to hang the clothes in the courtyard. After one night, the lice will all freeze to death. A shake will remove them all. One of Mr. Wang's comrades, named Rong, had a "louse hole" on each side of his waist, the size of a needle's eye. Lice would often crawl out of these holes. Every time Mr. Rong reached to his waist and touched it, dozens of lice would immediately gather in his palm. Because of this, Mr. Wang and others nicknamed him "Louse King." Later, Mr. Rong contracted the disease of "louse prison." This disease name had never been heard before. It is said that this disease is incurable, and those who contract it will die. So, Mr. Rong also died from it. At the moment of death, countless lice emerged from all seven orifices, including the anus and urethra, numbering no less than hundreds of thousands.</p>
<h3>A Tale of Two Buildings of Military Affairs (Part 4)</h3>
<p>— Master of Seeking Happiness Studio</p>
<p>Chapter One: An Unrivaled Courtesan Lives Alone, Cherishing Her Beautiful Companion; A Wanderering Student in a Foreign Land Creates a Strange Romance.</p>
<p>However, this heaven-defying omen was not the kind of superstitious talk that heaven would send down some kind of disaster or calamity upon her. It was just that since heaven had given birth to such a rare beauty, it would naturally endow her with a unique personality of innate intelligence. Although she seemed gentle and docile on the surface, and didn't seem to have much knowledge, she was still a person. And people have thoughts. Thinking and pondering in bits and pieces, referencing and examining, gradually piecing together a whole chain of reasoning, she discovered that she was a person without status, a person who was forced to be called a person just to be a plaything for others. She had no independent personality, no freedom of human rights. Living a life like a caged bird, she also faced the danger of being at the mercy of others' love and hate, and not knowing what would happen when she grew old and her beauty faded. So, she began to fear. She began to be angry. A new thought of urgently wanting to be a person and never being a plaything again was burning like a raging fire in her heart, affecting the strong and passionate personality that she had been suppressing, and it all exploded and manifested. She then displayed her spirit of resistance, exercised her decisive skills, and resolutely sought freedom and fought for liberation, looking like a fighting warrior. Her motives for declaring war and the course of the battle were reported so enthusiastically by major and minor newspapers at the time, like news of the European war, publishing many divergent reports. Although the matter seemed very important, the truth was obscured. No one knew which newspaper had the most accurate information. Fortunately, this is a thing of the past, and there is no need to seek certainty here. To put it simply, for more than half a year, although the old fellow had not been abusive to her, he had too many other favorites, and the old man could not divide himself and often did not accompany her in the small mansion. Occasionally, when he came, he gradually became presumptuous, cold and sarcastic, and did not give her a good look. A few days ago, she went out to a foreign firm and spent a dozen dollars to buy a pair of silk stockings. He found out and嫌她有点浪費。said that she was a little wasteful. He said two sentences to her. Then, he grew tired of her favorite little pug dog and lightly kicked it, causing the dog to bark and bark straight away. She suffered this grievance, clinging to the kicked dog, stroking it frequently, and quietly shedding a few tears. From then on, she never spoke to him again. A few days later, she took the dog and left. She found a lawyer famous for handling divorce cases and sent a formal letter to the old fellow, requesting a divorce. The old fellow saw that the situation was difficult to reverse. Suddenly, he became generous, willing to settle peacefully with her, giving her all the clothes, jewelry, furnishings, and appliances that he had bought for her over the years in the small mansion, and also giving her an additional $30,000 in cash as alimony. Finally, they met one last time.</p>

<h3>Financial Gold Price Has Fallen Back</h3>
<p>Reactionary Reversal, Down 9.7 Taels: Yesterday, the surge in the gold price subsided, and it softened again. It once returned to within 700 taels, with the situation unclear, seemingly advancing and retreating. There was a difference of more than nine taels between the morning and evening sessions, eventually falling by about ten taels. This was a reaction after several days of continuous rises. Although the opening was down and the large bars continued to fall, the silver price rose instead. Therefore, the sentiment among traders trended downwards. Subsequently, buyers showed courage and the exchange rate turned large, with the British exchange rate shrinking and the American exchange rate loosening. The price immediately rose by more than four taels. Later, rumors spread that American citizens were indignant about the Japanese invasion of North China and opposed Stimson's refusal to handle the matter according to the treaty. Market sentiment weakened further and continued to decline, falling from outside 700 taels to within 696 taels. The market recovered slightly later, but large buyers remained strong, showing signs of profit-taking. Eventually, it rebounded to 700 taels again. Although there was news of reduced production of Indian raw silver and future silver coin replacements, large long positions did not sell off, and there were still many small short positions. Therefore, the price had the potential to hold firm.</p>
<p>The morning market fluctuated, opening down 9.5 taels at 700 taels. Large silver bars fell another 3/8, while the silver price rose 1/8, and private telegrams were slightly 1/8. However, American silver was originally bearish yesterday, and Cheng Fengyong took the lead in selling (although they quoted 056 taels before the market opened). Subsequently, Yuan Maoyong, Yuan Heng, Zhifengyong, Yifeng, Daxingyong, and others scrambled to buy, and HSBC absorbed April US dollars at 32.4375 yuan, causing the price to jump more than four taels, fluctuating between one and two taels. At 9:20, it was 04.5 taels. At this time, Cuichangyong, Hongkangyong, and others sold, causing a small decline of about one tael, a total of 02.7 taels. The British gold rate was revealed to have shrunk by 375, while the US dollar was unmoved due to the exchange rate rebounding. At that time, it was added to 04.2 taels. Afterwards, selling pressure surged, with Jiayu, Dagan, Changxiang, Yuan Heng, Bingxing, Hongkangyong, and others all selling. Also, with the US dollar trending looser, the bank buying price was 625, causing the gold price to plummet seven taels, breaking 700 taels, until 10:15, it was 97.3 taels. Afterwards, HSBC and others absorbed April US dollars at 625, and Yifeng, Yuan Heng, Dadecheng, Yuan Maoyong, Wanxing, and others all bought, causing it to increase by four taels to 701.5 taels at 11:15. Suddenly, news was heard that the American public was questioning Secretary of State Stimson, urging him not to implement the Kellogg-Briand Pact and to stop the violent actions of the Japanese and the righteous indignation and unequal news. Because of this, the gold market suddenly became weak, falling six taels. Selling pressure on the trading floor remained strong, until the midday close at 95.6 taels. Later, Mr. Wu came to buy, adding to above 96 taels. The quoted price was still 747 taels, discounted by 50 taels. There may be holding action in the afternoon market. The afternoon market opened at 96.5 taels. It was heard that the Mumbai report was a small 10 anna, coupled with Yuan Maoyong, Zhifengyong, and others buying, it immediately rose two taels to 98.5 taels. After 2:15, Hengyu sold, and because Mitsui and others sold US dollars at 625, it retreated more than three taels, to 95.1 taels after 3:00. Subsequently, because US dollars were traded in and out at 6875, Anda bought March British gold at 11 pence, and Dadecheng, Yuan Maoyong, Cuichangyong, Fuyu, and Mr. Wu all bought without hesitation, causing the price to rise gradually, reaching 701.5 taels after 3:30. However, Zhongfu and others sold April US dollars at 625, and Yifengyong, Bingxing, Taifengcheng, and others sold, so it retreated again to 98.5 taels. But there were small purchases by retailers, closing near 700 taels and 005 yuan, then closing at 699.8 taels, falling back 9.7 taels compared to the previous day, and rising again to 700 taels with change. The maximum for the entire day was 704.5 taels, and the minimum price was 695.1 taels, a fluctuation of 9.4 taels. Goods were 01.5 taels in the morning, 96 taels at the midday close, 6.5 taels in the afternoon, and 005 yuan at the closing. The quoted price was discounted by 50 taels, and finally 478 taels, recorded at 98 taels to 96 taels, water replenishment at 98 taels, 02 taels in the afternoon, and the naked bar added 10 taels.</p>
<p>Each firm actively traded on the trading floor. According to statistics, Zhifengyong, Yuan Maoyong, Dadecheng, Yifeng, Yuantai, Futaiheng, Wanxing, and Shunli all bought, while Qianchangxiang, Bingxing, Yu Da, Richang, Hongkangyong, Cheng Fengyong, Yifengyong, and Taifengcheng all sold. Yuan Heng sold a total of over 1,000 bars, while buying 200 to 300 bars. Hengxing, Dakang, Senchangyong, and Tongtaichang had mixed transactions. In the afternoon, Zhifengyong, Yuan Maoyong, Chunyuanyong, Shunli, Cuichangyong, Wanxing, Futaiheng, and Dadecheng all bought, while Yuantai, Qianchangxiang, Yifengyong, and Hengxing all sold. Mr. Wu bought in both the morning and afternoon sessions. The Dalian gang sold over 200 bars and bought over 500 bars. The Guangdong gang sold over 200 bars and bought 600 to 700 bars.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange: British Tight, American Loose</h3>
<p>Gold Brokers Sell in the Morning, Buy in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Yesterday, overseas silver markets diverged, with British rates falling and American rates rising. Market conditions were generally flat, but exchange rates suddenly rose.

There were slight rotations during the day, and comparing the results to the previous day, British gold shrunk by 1.875, while US dollars rose by half a yuan, which was an exchange rate adjustment. This was a reaction to the four-day consecutive rise in the gold market, which had broken through the 700 tael mark. Chinese merchants still traded mostly in US dollars, with only several tens of thousands of pounds in and out for British gold, but approximately 600,000 to 700,000 yuan in US dollars. The gold brokers mostly sold off in the morning, recovering the slips, totaling approximately 32 taels. There were slight closing buys in the afternoon, and HSBC made some deposits, with the market situation generally circling.</p>

<h3>Large Silver Bars Continue to Shrink, American Silver Suddenly Increases</h3>
<p>Yesterday's London telegram reported that large silver bars continued to fall, shrinking 375 for both near-term and long-term contracts, both at 19 pence and 812. Sales were scarce from both China and the United States. The market was flat and vague. Market conditions stabilized further after the close. Another telegram from New York reported that the American silver price suddenly rose by 125, with the spot price at 29.75 cents. British rates versus American rates added 1/125, for 3.395 yuan. American rates versus British rates also rose 4/75, for 3.4025 yuan. London-Shanghai shillings also shortened by 1.875, for 1 shilling and 11 pence and 625. Mumbai was closed.</p>
<h3>Tael-Dollar Market Remains Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silver dollar situation was quite sluggish, and the dollar parity continued to fall. The morning market was 7 qian, 1 fen, 8 li, and 2 hao and a half, and the afternoon market was 7 qian, 1 fen, and 8 li, slightly lower by 3 hao and 7 hai and a half compared to the previous day's afternoon market. The silver premium was only 8 fen in the morning market, and 1 qian in the afternoon market. Therefore, the banks did not list any rates at all, did not add water to the rates, and did only blank transactions. Bank drafts of 1.48 million were made in the morning market, and 1.115 million in the afternoon market. There were no banknote transactions in either market, and only 65,000 in unofficial banknotes in the morning market.

<p>Securities</p>
<h3>Bond Prices Rise and Fall Mutually</h3>
<p>The Securities Exchange will Reduce Futures Margin Next Week</p>
<p>Yesterday (August 8th), the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange had various bond market conditions. There was no spot trading in the morning, but the bond markets opened up later, and the market was not quiet. Only one type of futures contract, the one-month contract, was traded. The market conditions were slack, and the two-month contract remained untraded. The bond market atmosphere was dull, and the situation was developing without new developments. The market sentiment was cold, and large investors rarely traded in and out, making the market very quiet. Supply and demand were balanced, and the prices became increasingly sluggish. The price fluctuated by only about half a yuan before and after the market, and its stability was unprecedented. As a result, compared to the previous day, the 6 percent and the 19th Customs bonds each fell by 1 yuan and 2 jiao, the Conscription bonds rose by 1 yuan and 4 jiao due to the lottery, while other bonds rose and fell mutually, and the number was only around 4 or 5 jiao. The futures for the 19th Customs, Consolidated Tax, and 96th bonds were the same as the previous day. Observing the bond market situation, it has fallen into a state of chaos, and there will be no major rise or fall for the time being. According to statistics, the total futures trading volume was 2.655 million yuan before and after the market, and the spot trading volume was 23,500 yuan. Also, the Securities Exchange decided to appropriately reduce the futures trading margin starting next week due to the recent trend of stable market prices and slack market conditions. It is set to collect 400 yuan for each 10,000 yuan transaction for both buyers and sellers, 1,000 yuan for special certificates, totaling 1,400 yuan.</p>

<h3>Yarn Flower Cotton Yarn Market Quiet</h3>
<p>The yarn market is calm and shows no signs of invigoration. Due to the deteriorating situation and the apparent loosening but actual tightening of credit, morale is low. Actual demand also lacks active impetus, resulting in a stalemate where prices neither rise nor fall.</p>
<p>Spot market saw a slight dip of two or three cash. The market opened weak before the official session, with extremely scarce trading. Prices for various months rose slightly by two, three, and four cash. In the afternoon, the current month fell by seven cash, and distant months fell by thirteen cash. Total daily transactions were estimated at 7,000 bales. Sold: Yu 800 bales, Geng Feng 200 bales, Da Chang 200 bales. Bought: Da Ji 300 bales, Yi Chang 950 bales, Tian Long 200 bales, He Shen 300 bales. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>

<h3>Cotton Prices Weak Recently</h3>
<p>The cotton market has been very weak this month, with a significant downward trend. Due to extremely tight credit, there are fewer buyers. Actual demand is very low. Factories are not taking any action, and the situation is softening. However, long-term bulls are holding firm and not letting go. It has been reported that 2,000 bales of goods received in Ningdu last month have already been loaded for shipment. The future of the cotton market is uncertain.</p>
<p>Spot cotton alone fell by three cash. The market opened weak for Han standard cotton, with American cotton remaining stable, each falling five cents to one cash. In the afternoon, the current month fell by two cash, and distant months fell by one cash. Total daily transactions were estimated at 34,900 dan.

<h3>Foreign Cotton: British Rises, American Falls</h3>
<p>Indian cotton market remains closed.</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton initially strengthened due to buying by peers, but later weakened due to profit-taking by bulls and selling from the South. Futures fell by one to four points. Spot prices remained unchanged. British cotton futures rose by four points, and spot prices rose by eleven points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by ten points. The Indian cotton market is closed.

<h3>River Down Rice: Rising Trend Stabilizes</h3>
<p>Few boats arrived in the South Shanghai market yesterday. Urban and rural shops were quiet. Suzhou and Tongbai japonica rice were expensive and stable, while early and late rice saw little demand, with no price increases or decreases. Three loads of foreign Du-style pointed-grain rice were sold entirely on the same day, with prices up five cents, equivalent to two yuan. Dessert shops were the most active, purchasing 600 dan, with prices rising slightly. The weather cleared at Xin Zha Tian Shi, with a source of thirty to forty houses on the west road. The situation was uninspired. Suzhou and Changbei japonica rice prices were initially firm in the morning but turned sluggish in the afternoon, with prices softening by one dime. Thin rice has been falling sharply for days, and future supplies will inevitably be scarce. Du-style pointed grain rice arrivals were not abundant, demand was also quiet, and prices remained unchanged. Glutinous rice trading was brisk, with a stable situation.</p>
<h3>Taizhou Special Rice: New Arrivals</h3>
<p>Foreign rice sales are very good on this street.</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market saw active spot sales. Despite large-scale arrivals, the market showed signs of prosperity. Although prices did not rise significantly, they have increased by about half a yuan compared to the lowest prices in the middle of last month. Yesterday's sales were mainly driven by this street, with 3,500 bags of Xiaoxiao rice sold at prices ranging from nine yuan and one dime to five dimes and eight cents. 2,000 bags of Number One Saigon rice were sold at eleven yuan, one dime, and four cents. Foreign rice companies were still actively seeking to sell futures, but deals were not reached yesterday, and trading volume was low. 回籠貨 trading was more active, with sales of around 2,000 tons. The market showed slight weakness, with Xiaoxiao rice for March offered at four liang and four qian, April at four liang and five qian and a half, and May at four liang and seven qian and two and a half fen. Number One Saigon rice for February was offered at five liang, two qian, and six fen.</p>
<p>客秈 rice from Hunan and Jiangxi provinces is no longer available. There is also not much from Anhui province. However, the harvest in Wenzhou and Taizhou is still good. Yesterday, there were new arrivals of Taizhou special white rice, with 588 bags offered at eleven yuan, seven dimes, and four cents. These were also purchased by businesses on this street.</p>
<h3>Flour: Initially Strong, Then Weak</h3>
<p>Dalian Group Gradually Selling</p>
<p>Flour Exchange Suspends Trading for Ten Days for New Year Holiday</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the market opened in the morning, flour prices for various months showed a slight upward trend due to favorable foreign wheat quotations, rising by about four dimes, and the continuous rise in gold prices, which boosted market confidence. As a result, prices for various months rose by about one fen compared to the previous day. However, trading was not smooth, and actual sales were mostly cautious. After the market opened in the afternoon, trading remained quiet. However, it was reported that the Dalian Group, due to political issues, was facing difficulties in shipping goods and was gradually selling out. Although there was no widespread selling pressure, market sentiment softened again. Given the sluggish actual sales, the outcome for this month is still subject to change. As a result, prices for January and February remained unchanged, March increased by two li and a half, April remained unchanged, May increased by small seven li and a half, and June increased by large two li and a half.</p>
<p>The Flour Exchange will suspend trading for ten days from the 30th of this month until the 10th of February. This has been announced in the market.</p>
<h3>Wheat Prices Decline</h3>
<p>Exchange Suspends Trading for Thirteen Days from the 28th for New Year Holiday</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the market opened in the morning and afternoon, wheat prices for various months showed a flat and weak trend. As the Lunar New Year approaches, many outside speculators are liquidating their positions. Furthermore, due to the sale of relief wheat, the millers' wheat stocks are becoming more abundant. The supply of raw wheat in the market appears to be dwindling. In this environment, bulls have little room to maneuver. Consequently, prices for this month have been declining step by step. According to observations within the industry, the final outcome may be lower than the prices at the end of last year. Prices for distant months also showed slight weakness. As a result, the price for this month fell by five fen compared to the previous day, February fell by three fen, March and April fell by two fen, May fell by one fen, and June fell by two fen. The Miscellaneous Grains Exchange has decided to suspend trading from the 28th of this month until the 10th of February. It is said that this is due to the need to settle accounts for the Lunar New Year.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea</p>
<h3>European and American Silk Markets Increasingly Weak and Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign silk market in this port was weak and quiet. This was due to the extremely low opening prices for raw silk in the European and American markets, resulting in sluggish factory sales. Telegrams from Shanghai were not forwarded, and market sentiment was sluggish. Yesterday, only Chang and other companies purchased 25 bales of white dried silk, with prices remaining flat and weak.</p>
<h3>Spring Cocoon Opening Prices Remain High</h3>
<p>Each 100 Jin of silk needs to pull out 850-860 liang of silk.</p>
<p>Although sales of white factory silk to Europe and America have been sluggish, cocoon prices have remained firm. This is because the spring cocoon harvest last year was poor in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, and the opening prices for fresh cocoons were not low. The 折頭 (discount) (i.e., the conversion rate from cocoons to silk) was also high, resulting in higher cocoon costs. Cocoon merchants have maintained a firm stance, and cocoon prices remain high. Yesterday, a silk factory in Zhabei purchased 108 dan of Changzhou East Road spring dried cocoons at a price of 171 liang. The conversion rate was 500 jin of silk. Each 100 jin of silk requires 850-860 liang of cocoons.</p>
<h3>Wuyuan Zhenmei Tea Already Showing Signs of Activity</h3>
<p>Wuyuan North Road Zhenmei tea has always been known for its excellent production methods. Last year, sales to Morocco, Africa, and other markets were sluggish due to the Japanese promoting and undermining its reputation and the competition from cheap Japanese tea. As a result, there were significant stockpiles in the Shanghai market. Recently, Chinese merchants, considering that the Gregorian New Year has passed, have had to repeatedly lower prices in order to sell their goods and recover their funds. Yesterday, Baochang, Tianyu, and other companies purchased over 300 chests, with selling prices around 100 liang, which is 40-50 liang lower than before. Chinese merchants have suffered significant losses.</p>
<p>Hardware: Black Iron Sheet Sales Revive</p>
<p>Trading in black iron sheets was previously brisk due to a shortage of supplies and heavy purchases by various groups. As a result, market prices rose sharply to 11 liang and 5 qian. Later, due to the situation in Tianjin, sales became sluggish. Although various businesses made every effort to promote sales, they were ultimately unable to revive the market due to the unfavorable environment. In recent days, with the colder weather, various groups have resumed purchasing. As a result, transactions have become brisk again. Yesterday, there were a total of 600-700 dan traded, with buyers from the Northern Group and local factories. Although prices have not yet increased significantly, they have improved by two qian compared to before. 18-sheet goods are estimated at 11 liang per dan, and 36-foot goods are offered at 9 liang and 7 qian and a half per dan.</p>
<p>Coal: Kailping Coal Prices Rise Slightly</p>
<p>Since the New Year, Kailping coal prices have been increased by the company due to the limited supply of various types of Kailping coal. The current selling price for Kailping special coal is 11 liang per ton, which is 5 qian higher than before. Kailping Number One coal is 10 liang per ton, and Number Two coal is 9 liang, 2 qian and 5 fen, each rising 2 qian and a half. Kailping lump coal has also risen 5 qian, currently selling for 11 liang per ton. Market traders are offering prices with an additional 2 qian and a half to 5 qian per ton.</p>

<h3>Wang Zhaoming's Telegram Replies to Chen Mingshu</h3>
<p>Details Reasons for Resigning from Standing Committee</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei, who is ill in the hospital, telegraphed Chen Mingshu of Nanjing yesterday, saying: "To Vice President Chen Xun of the Nanjing Executive Yuan: I have received your telegram and am deeply grateful. Since my departure, I have been ill in bed and have repeatedly received your concerns. You are very familiar with my condition and treatment methods, so it goes without saying that I am not using illness as an excuse to shirk responsibility. However, given my current condition, I am unable to travel. In recent days, many comrades from various parties have come to see me. Refusing to see them often leads to misunderstandings, while meeting them results in serious issues being raised that often exceed the doctor's prescribed time. For this reason, I have repeatedly experienced dizziness. From this, it can be inferred that even if my own life is not worth cherishing, using a confused mind to deal with complex events would harm the party and the country, which is a great concern. This is similar to a wounded soldier who needs time to heal. Driving them to the battlefield would only lead to their defeat. Since I have been re-elected as a Central Executive Committee member by the congress, I dare not lightly abandon my responsibility. However, the Standing Committee, by its very name, requires daily attendance to handle daily affairs. Now that I am unable to do so due to illness, I should submit a request to the Central Party Headquarters and the Political Council to be relieved of this position. The telegram has already been sent, and I hope you will understand. Although I am bedridden and my situation is different from yours, our well-being is closely linked. If I can recover quickly, I will have more time to make up for my shortcomings. Please also convey this to my brothers, Zhesheng and others. Wang Zhaoming, Geng."</p>
<h3>Feng Yuxiang Visited Wang Yesterday to Urge Him to Stay</h3>
<p>Following Wang Jingwei's telegram to Nanjing resigning from his positions on the Central Party Headquarters and the Standing Committee of the Political Council, National Government Member Feng Yuxiang personally visited Wang at Nar Hospital on Avenue Joffre at 4:15 PM yesterday to express his sympathy and earnestly urge him to stay. The two men spoke for about half an hour before Feng left at 4:50 PM. It is reported that Wang's condition has not improved and he still experiences dizziness, so he intends to firmly resign. As for Feng's trip to Hong Kong, he telegraphed Hu Zhantang a few days ago to inquire about his views and arrange a date. He will leave Shanghai for the south as soon as he receives Hu's reply.</p>
<h3>Feng Yuxiang's Admonitory Letter to Subordinates</h3>
<p>Feng Yuxiang recently sent a letter to one of his subordinates, admonishing them on various matters. The tone is very sincere. The letter is excerpted below: (Omitted part) "I thank you for sending someone from afar to see me. All letters and details of the military situation have been forwarded by Comrade so-and-so, and I am very pleased to know them well. To reciprocate your kindness, I would like to share some of my insights with you, which may be helpful to you in these difficult times for the country. I will list several points below: (1) Defending the country is the duty of us soldiers, and we should always be mindful of national humiliation and national crisis, and always be prepared to avenge and relieve the crisis. We must not avoid danger and fear hardship, and eliminate the ambition of soldiers and abandon the duty of soldiers. We should think that this is the time for soldiers to serve the country. In the past hundred years, the humiliation our country has suffered has been extreme. More than 3 million square miles of land have been lost, and 30 million compatriots have been enslaved. The loss of property is not counted, and our compatriots who have been captured are being raped and killed by the Japanese army every day. Who has no parents, who has no siblings, who is not heartbroken by the devastation? As recently reported, the Japanese army entered Jin and searched and killed more than 3,000 soldiers and students at one time, not to mention other incidents. This is the actual damage our country has suffered. The Japanese propaganda abroad is even more disrespectful to us. Fangze and Inuyakii, etc., said that China is only a country in name, and does not actually qualify as a country. Biyuan said that there will never be war between China and Japan, because Chinese soldiers are all softbones and do not know what a country is. My brother, can you not be heartbroken when you hear this? I hope that my brother will continue to uphold our usual patriotic enthusiasm, encourage the soldiers, and swear to avenge this shame, so as not to be ashamed of being a soldier, and so as not to be unworthy of the people's support. My brother, strive to serve the country today. If you do not work hard now, I am afraid that you will want to save your country and love it after the country is destroyed. (2) To serve the country and the people, we must never forget the country and the people, and we must put all our own interests out of the question. Only by benefiting the country and the people, and not seeking benefits for ourselves, can we be called revolutionaries, and can we discuss the doctrine of revolution. In this way, we will not fail the country and the people in the public sphere, and we will also complete our own immortal career in the private sphere. The whole point is the distinction between public and private, which must first be clarified. (3) True and false are certain, and there is no room for doubt. For example, training troops is for protecting the country and defending the people, for the public and not for the private. Discipline must be strict, physical strength must be healthy, and soldiers must share weal and woe. All hobbies must be cut off. Also, whatever officers want soldiers to abide by, officers must first abide by, and if they want soldiers to be unafraid of death, generals must be unafraid of death. These are all truths, all true and false. Conversely, if generals do what soldiers are not allowed to do, then there is no right and wrong. If right and wrong are not clear, even if a person deals with things in the world, he will not be respected or trusted, and he will definitely fail. How can we not be cautious about such a major matter as governing an army? (4) 'The people are the foundation of the country' has been said for thousands of years. In democratic countries today, the people are the masters, and we should pay more attention to the people. Everything must be aimed at the interests of the people, and there must be no oppression of the people, and there must be no disrespect for the people. We must know that the parents of officers and soldiers are the people, and the brothers of officers and soldiers are the people, that is, the relatives, friends, neighbors, and countrymen of officers and soldiers, all of whom are the people. Loving and respecting the people is loving and respecting our own parents, brothers, relatives, friends, neighbors, and countrymen. In particular, we must know that the suffering of the people has mostly become an inhuman life, so how can we bear to oppress them again? Not to mention that the oppressed people will inevitably resist, even with our conscience, we should not oppress them. In addition, there are other friends, that is, in order to unite all parties and unite against foreign enemies, we only ask for sincerity and joint efforts to save the country. We have no other desires. I am in the position of an ordinary citizen, doing my duty, and have no hope of wielding military power again. I only hope that you will sincerely work hard, diligently do your duty, revitalize yourself, promote yourself, and spur yourself on to become a simple and hardworking patriotic soldier. I am willing and satisfied. Of course, I will do my best to help you with other things. Don't worry about it."</p>
<h3>Wu Chaoshu Departs for Guangzhou This Morning</h3>

<p>Wu Chaoshu, the newly appointed President of the National Government's Judicial Yuan, departed for Guangzhou yesterday, at 11:00 PM, from Jianghai Customs Wharf, accompanied by his wife, daughter, and staff, on a small steamer across the river.

It is reported that upon arriving in Hong Kong, Wu will meet with Hu Zhantang in a personal capacity to urge him to work diligently, despite his illness.</p>
<h3>Tan Zhen's Important Remarks</h3>
<p>Wang, Hu, Jiang, and Sun All Share Responsibility for Practical Politics</p>
<p>The Government Takes Public Opinion as Its Guide and Does Not Use the Military as a Background</p>
<p>The Far Eastern News Agency reports that Tan Liming, the Vice President of the Legislative Yuan, who recently arrived in Shanghai and is staying at the Cangzhou Hotel, made important remarks to a reporter from the Far Eastern News Agency who visited him regarding the establishment of the new government. He said that the new government was officially established on New Year's Day, but because Mr. Wang, Mr. Hu, and Mr. Jiang have not yet come to Nanjing to participate, many people speculate that the new government's foundation may not be solid because the three gentlemen have not taken responsibility in Nanjing. In fact, the establishment of the new government is based on the party's sincere unity and the people's desire for peace and unity. Although the new government's center of gravity seems to be the responsibility of the President of the Executive Yuan, Mr. Sun Zhesheng, the Executive Yuan only assumes administrative responsibility, and the Executive Yuan's policy must be subject to the Central Executive Committee, and the Central Executive Committee's guidance of the political machine is the Central Political Council. Mr. Wang, Mr. Hu, and Mr. Jiang are all standing committee members of the Central Political Council, so Mr. Wang, Mr. Hu, and Mr. Jiang all share the responsibility for the highest political guidance. Moreover, Mr. Sun Zhesheng's resolute entry into Nanjing, taking on arduous tasks, and shouldering administrative responsibilities is the common will and joint recommendation of Mr. Wang, Mr. Hu, and Mr. Jiang. However, the power and will are often unable to be concentrated and unified. This is an undeniable fact. This time, the comrades inside and outside the party, because of the increasing foreign aggression and the imminent national disaster, must sincerely unite in order to seek unity, and without unity, they cannot resist foreign aggression. Therefore, comrades from all parties, under the strict supervision of the people of the whole country, have abandoned their prejudices, cooperated, and jointly elected Mr. Sun Zhesheng as the President of the Executive Yuan. This move is completely based on factual needs, because sincere unity means that the comrades of our party share the responsibility of building the country. Mr. Wang, Mr. Hu, and Mr. Jiang have always been in a guiding position in politics, and they must now express that they share responsibility, so it is not appropriate for any one of the three to take on the actual political responsibility alone. Therefore, we sincerely hope that they will all come to Nanjing as soon as possible to decide on the party and government policies of the central government. However, whether they come to Nanjing or not, they will still have political responsibility, because they cannot shirk their responsibility in the past history, and now the Central Political Council is composed of the three gentlemen as standing committee members, and Mr. Sun Zhesheng as the President of the Executive Yuan, which is also jointly elected by the three gentlemen. In recent days, not long after the establishment of the new government, there have been many speculations and rumors. In fact, the new government was established at a time when the people's minds were wavering. This situation may be unavoidable. However, Chinese politics is greatly affected by the wavering of the people's minds. Some people often cannot calmly observe the political situation and make rational judgments, and they are easily shaken. Cunning people take advantage of this kind of unstable psychology to fuel the flames and hinder the government's policies. Taking the establishment of the new government as an example, since the new government is generated by the party's sincere unity and the people's expectations, the people should trust and support it. They cannot make random speculations just because Mr. Wang, Mr. Hu, and Mr. Jiang have not yet arrived in Nanjing. Under the complex environment inside and outside, only this newly established government can stabilize the interior, and only by stabilizing the interior can we resist foreign aggression. Also, such as the recent rumors about the nine-province joint defense, Minister He Yingqin has denied that there is no such thing. However, people have been spreading rumors, and there is a general idea that division and internal strife are about to come. This situation can prove the people's desire to end the chaos, but I hope that the people will observe calmly and not be too nervous. The new government believes that at a time when foreign troubles are increasing, no one will dare to defy the people of the whole country, otherwise they will be despised by the people. As for the Chinese military, they have always held their guns to coerce everything and threaten the government. This phenomenon is entirely due to the fact that those in power in the past wanted to use force to unify the country. The members of the new government dare to express their firm will, that is, to absolutely not rely on the strength of any one military to support politics. We have no military as a background, and we will never want to use the military. The foundation of the new government is built on the great transition of all party comrades and the trust and support of the people of the whole country. In the future, we will adhere to this principle, take public opinion as our guide, and seek self-reliance. Also, such as the establishment of political sub-committees in the two provinces of Guangdong and Guangxi, although there have been records in the newspapers in recent days, many people have proposed this matter at the Fourth Plenary Session, and they have not had time to study it in detail. The resolution was handed over to the Standing Committee for verification and handling, and there will be a solution in the future. Furthermore, the statement published by the soldiers in the Northeast was not signed and cannot be immediately recognized as a fact. In short, the new government was established in an unstable environment for the people, and various doubts are inevitable. However, I hope that the people will observe the politics more calmly in the future, and urge and support the government with enthusiasm, so as to jointly complete this current task. As for Mr. Wang, Mr. Hu, and Mr. Jiang, we hope that they can all come to Nanjing as soon as possible and share the difficult tasks with their colleagues. However, whether they come to Nanjing or not, they will still be responsible for the actual government. As for the armed comrades, I hope that they will work hard to prepare for national defense, pay attention to local pacification, do their duty, and not make claims against the government at will, make criticisms at will, and should absolutely obey the government's orders. This government has been jointly promoted by all party comrades and the people of the whole country.</p>

<h3>Taiwanese Émigrés Longing for the Motherland</h3>
<p>The Suffering of Taiwanese Compatriots... The Motherland Faces Imminent Danger</p>
<p>Compatriots, Rise Up Quickly... Willing to Provide Support</p>
<p>A Respectful Announcement from the Taiwanese Émigré Association to All Compatriots Throughout the Country: We humbly believe that since Taiwan was ceded to Japan by our motherland after the defeat in the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95, forty years have passed. At that time, our three million compatriots, in order to satiate the greed of the fierce enemy and save the motherland from collapse and peril, swallowed their voices and shed tears, becoming slaves to others. We originally hoped that the motherland would learn from this experience, strive for self-improvement, and seek to govern well so as to wipe away the humiliation and seek revenge, so that Taiwanese compatriots could one day see the light of day again. Unexpectedly, in the past twenty-odd years, the government has become more and more corrupt, the country more and more chaotic, the military more and more numerous, and the country more and more weakened. Recently, Liaoning and Jilin were lost in less than three days, allowing the ancestral enemy, the Japanese bandits, to trample upon the four northeastern provinces. The whole country is horrified and wishes to fight to the death. However, the authorities of the motherland are only preoccupied with dealing with internal party and political disputes, and externally only want to rely on the League of Nations, the organ of the great powers for dividing spoils, to seek compromise and gain. Therefore, after two months of delay, they only managed to send personnel to investigate. Japanese troops invaded Longjiang to the north, but could not be stopped, and disturbed Jinzhou and Yulin to the west, but could not be resisted. It seems that they will allow twenty million compatriots to once again be subjected to the island nation's slavery. When our compatriots heard the news, they were filled with grief. If the three eastern provinces can be abandoned, then what is to prevent the three western provinces, the three northern provinces, and the three southern provinces from being regarded as border provinces and abandoned accordingly? If Japan can take three provinces, what is to prevent Britain, Russia, America, and France from each taking the three provinces they desire? If the motherland, though large, can be completely lost in less than five years, what hope is there for us Taiwanese compatriots? Today, our four hundred million compatriots no longer have the opportunity to endure hardship and bide our time for revenge. We can hope to fight, but we will surely perish if we do not fight. In the past, when Taiwan was ceded, Tang, Qiu, Liu, and other gentlemen still established a republic and fought for a year, killing tens of thousands of Japanese. In the subsequent thirty-odd years, we Taiwanese, empty-handed, launched twenty-five revolutions. This shows that our people are not incapable of fighting. This time, the authorities of the motherland, fearing the Japanese's strength and violence, advocated non-resistance and calmness, and retreated thousands of miles. However, General Ma Zhanshan's lone army fought bravely and repeatedly thwarted the enemy's advance, standing firm outside the borders to this day, unyielding. This shows that our army is not incapable of fighting. As for internal political and party disputes, these are just family matters between brothers. If each side yields a little, what is there that cannot be resolved? Otherwise, please come to Taiwan and see the suffering of four million compatriots who are being trampled upon by foreigners and made slaves to foreigners. Then, what resentment and hatred could not be dispelled? Alas, the situation is urgent, the country is in danger! Peace or war should be decided by public opinion, and all policies should be decided by the whole people. This simple and direct approach is truly the most important plan for today. We hope that our four hundred million compatriots will rise up quickly and plan for it. Our four million Taiwanese compatriots, due to the various policies of isolation imposed by the Japanese, have been almost forgotten by the people of the motherland for the past twenty-odd years. Furthermore, because one or two unfilial sons have been exploited by the Japanese in Xiamen and Fujian, committing evil deeds in the name of the enemy, the people of the motherland have fallen for the Japanese's divisive tactics and often harbor contempt for the entire group, not regarding them as ordinary overseas Chinese. They do not know that our four million compatriots sacrificed their human rights in the past to save the motherland. Today, not only is their conduct not free, but there are no Chinese schools on the island. New Chinese ideas and party doctrines are completely banned, and they are not allowed to enter. However, the authorities of the motherland do not observe this. In successive national representative conferences, our island's four million overseas Chinese do not have a single fixed quota, treating them as uncivilized and stubborn people, just like the former Qing dynasty. The Japanese bandits are secretly pleased by this. However, the feelings of our Taiwanese compatriots for the motherland have never diminished. Those with education and aspirations have returned to the country to serve year after year, spreading throughout the political, academic, military, commercial, medical, industrial, and agricultural circles of the central and southern provinces. There are countless people who have made special and continuous contributions. However, in order to protect their relatives and avoid the Japanese's surveillance, they have all changed their names and adopted ancestral origins, so people do not notice. This time, with the outbreak of the national crisis in the Northeast, Taiwanese compatriots throughout the island are even more deeply saddened and indignant. They send people back to their hometowns, avoiding the enemy's eyes and ears, to inquire about how to act in concert with the compatriots of the motherland. Compatriots, strive! We hope that all, from top to bottom, will be of one mind, abandon private views, and quickly decide on a war resolution, establishing a military force to recover the lost territories and rescue twenty million compatriots from fire and water. Although we Taiwanese compatriots are not clever, we will surely have ways to provide support for the motherland. As I write, I am filled with grief and do not know what to say. Respectfully announced by the Taiwanese Émigré Association in December of the 20th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>Opinions on National Salvation from All Sectors</h3>
<p>A Telegram from the National Salvation Association to the National Government of the Republic of China: We respectfully submit to the Nanjing National Government: After the fall of Jinzhou, this association has four proposals: (1) Ma Zhanshan was able to resist Japan with a lone army, while Zhang Xueliang was unable to resist Japan with a large army. We request that clear orders be issued to reward and punish them separately. This is the first point. (2) Zhang Fakui telegraphed to support Heilongjiang, Feng Yuxiang strongly advocated fighting Japan, Yan Xishan advocated mobilizing troops, and He Yingqin telegraphed requesting mobilization. We request that clear orders be issued to implement these measures. This is the second point. (3) Currently, Shanhaiguan is in imminent danger. While urgently addressing the symptoms, it is also necessary to address the root cause. Since Feng Yuxiang is the most vigorous advocate of war and Zhang Xueliang has difficulty resisting the enemy, we request that the troops be transferred to Feng's command, and that all departments in the Northwest and Northeast be uniformly designated as National Salvation Armies, vowing to declare war and recover the territory within a fixed time, so as to avert the crisis. At the same time, dispatch elite troops as reinforcements. This is the third point. (4) Many plans were made before the establishment of the new government, but after its establishment, there were still no concrete measures, greatly disappointing the people. Since the tragic loss of the Northeast, the people of the country have said that the former government misled the country. Now that Jinzhou has not been defended, the new government can hardly escape its blame. From now on, we request that it bear full responsibility for diplomatic measures, the recovery of territory, and the resettlement of the people. This is the fourth point. During the National Congress, this association formally submitted a petition, and during the First Plenary Session of the Central Committee, it proposed six national salvation plans, which Central Committee member Wu Tiecheng fully accepted in principle. Now that the national crisis is becoming more and more dangerous, the millions of troops in the country have more than enough strength to resist Japan and suppress the communists. If there is further delay and indecision, we will inevitably perish together. However, the country belongs to four hundred million people, and it is imperative that we rise up to save ourselves. In addition to establishing branch associations in various places to unite the people and preparing a National Salvation Army based on the first telegram, this association requests clear instructions on whether the four proposals are appropriate. We urge you to respond without delay, as Shanhaiguan may not be able to be defended, and the country may be destroyed in less than ten minutes. Survival is at stake at this moment. We hope that all compatriots and comrades in the country will rise up quickly, pursue the enemy directly, unite to save the country, and not delay. Respectfully, the National Salvation Association of the Republic of China, Qi Yin.</p>
<p>A Telegram from the Anti-Japanese Association of Shanghai University on Behalf of the Shanghai University Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association: We humbly submit to all newspapers and sectors: We recently sent a telegram to the National Government and the Central Committee, stating: We humbly submit to Chairman Lin of the National Government, the Standing Committee members of the Central Political Council, Standing Committee member Wang, and Standing Committee member Hu: As the situation changes, the overall situation becomes more and more dangerous. Zhang Xueliang presented Jinzhou as a New Year's gift, handing it over with both hands. He Chengjun revived the old trick of nine-province joint defense with new variations, harboring ulterior motives. The great disaster in the Northeast continues, while the storms in the Southwest intensify. Internal strife ignores external threats, and external threats do not forget internal strife. Alas, what kind of nation has the Chinese nation become? What kind of rulers are those in power? On this day of imminent peril, all the students of Shanghai University, with our last breath, dare to speak out and plead before you all: The time is urgent, the situation is pressing! Today, the power of life and death of the Chinese nation rests entirely in your hands. If you do not destroy China, no one can destroy China. We ask you to save China, for no one else can save China. Our four hundred million compatriots entrust their lives to you all. Now, the strong enemy is invading deeper and deeper, but your conflicts have not lessened because of this. The national crisis is becoming more and more urgent, but your actions are becoming slower and slower. We ask, who is responsible for the increasing phenomenon of disintegration today? Although the violent Japanese are fierce, their skills are limited to attacking cities and seizing land; they cannot divide our brothers or separate our compatriots. Alas, will world history not write in large letters two hundred years from now, "It was the Chinese who destroyed China"? When the Premier was on his deathbed, he earnestly instructed us, "Peaceful struggle to save China." Did he mean to use peace to deal with external enemies and internal strife to save China? Today, there is no peace to be had with external enemies, and we retreat step by step. There is a need for peace internally, but swords are drawn and bows are strung. Internal strife should be resolutely avoided, but we insist on fighting. We should fight external enemies urgently, but we lower our banners and silence our drums. Everything is so frustrating that we want to cry but cannot, and want to laugh but cannot. You all, the time is urgent, the situation is pressing! Lay down the butcher's knife of internal strife, and you can become Buddhas on the spot. Cooperate in spirit to thank the people of the country. Rise up quickly to eliminate the strong enemy. This is the only way for you and the four hundred million people to survive together. Old accounts must not be settled again, and new realizations must be made. We have said all we can, and we will wait with tears in our eyes. The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of Shanghai University, Yu.</p>
<p>A Telegram from the 26th Branch of the Municipal Federation: The 26th Branch of the Municipal Federation telegraphed to Chairman Lin of the National Government, Premier Sun of the Executive Yuan, and Central Committee members Wang, Hu, Jiang, and others, stating: Since the September 18th Incident, the people of the whole country have been appealing to all parties, requesting unity to jointly face the national crisis. After exhausting our strength and shouting until we lost our voices for three or four months, we finally achieved a unified government. The people looked forward to it like the re-emergence of the sun and the moon, celebrating with tears in our eyes, thinking that from now on we could unite to save the country. However, from the time of the incident until now, a long time has passed, and the three provinces have been allowed to be lost. The people are in dire straits, living under the iron heel, enduring pain and shedding tears. The troops in the country are stationed and ignore the people's pleas. The people demand that troops be sent to resist, but their requests are ignored. They are left with empty hands and empty calls, waiting patiently for the unified government to implement a plan to save the country. Now, it is reported that some members of the National Government have not yet taken office, or have taken office but are scattered and irresponsible. Central Committee members Wang, Hu, and Jiang are especially watched by China and foreign countries, and are critical to the stability of the country. At this time of national crisis, they should quickly go to the capital to jointly lead the central government, so that those who are generally hesitant to move forward can also be revitalized and jointly plan the country's affairs. Is it that after three of our country's twenty-two provinces have been lost, we do not want to protect the other provinces? And now does the government want to continue to sit and watch? We do not understand to what degree the Central Committee members must see the country destroyed before they can have a change of heart and save the country's people, preferring to be heroes of a destroyed country rather than slaves of a conquered nation. All who have blood and qi share this sentiment. The country's destruction is imminent. We quickly hope that the Central Committee members will share the difficulties with the country, be of one heart and one mind, and quickly decide on a plan to save the country. Time will not come again, so do not delay. We respectfully look forward to your reply. The 16th Branch of the Municipal Federation, Kou Geng.</p>
<h3>Wu Zhihao's Opinions on National Salvation</h3>
<p>Wu Zhihao sent a letter to the National Federation of Commerce and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, stating: I respectfully submit that since the founding of the Republic of China, twenty-one years have passed with frequent disasters and repeated famines. There has been no peaceful year. As a result, the people are unable to make a living and the country's strength is declining day by day. Looking back, I cannot help but tremble with fear. Now, the fires of war in the Northeast are raging day and night, and our beautiful rivers and mountains have fallen into the hands of foreign lands. If we do not sleep with our weapons as pillows and wait for dawn to strike down the strong enemy, then the vast land of China will be destroyed and the Chinese people will all be reduced to barbarians. I, Zhihao, am just a merchant and do not know the art of governance, but I dare not lag behind others in my patriotic zeal. I humbly submit my limited views based on the principle that every citizen is responsible for the rise and fall of the world, and earnestly request that your association invite sages from all walks of life to discuss them together: (1) Governance: The strength or weakness of a country depends on its internal affairs, and the goodness or badness of its internal affairs depends on its governance. What has been the governance of our country in the past twenty years has already been shown to the people. Now, for the sake of consolidating the country and ensuring social stability, it is imperative to learn from the past, change course, work hard to govern well, and put things on the right track. As for the steps to be taken, those in power must first abandon past grievances, set a common goal, divide labor and cooperate, and pacify the country to resist foreign enemies. With this spirit of great fearlessness, we can achieve the goal of the world belonging to all. Civil and military officials should encourage each other not to love money and not to fear death, so that the evils of corruption can be eliminated and the responsibility of defending the territory can be fulfilled. However, the affairs of state are complex and there may be shortcomings in the measures taken. Therefore, it is appropriate to gather talents from various provinces to organize political discussion bodies, so that each can express their views and do their best. We can gather small things and think widely to increase the benefits, and even pick up what has been left out and fill in the gaps. Even social conditions and public sentiment can be communicated upwards without being blocked. Only then can governance be cleared up, internal affairs be rectified, and the foundation of prosperity and strength be laid. (2) National Defense: At this time when might makes right, we should pay attention to national defense. Our country has been taught by the gunboat policy of the great powers for decades, but as time passes, we forget. Even with the September 18th Incident, three months have passed and several provinces have been lost. The enemy is raging like fire, and there is a tendency to penetrate deep into our territory, while our policies are divided and we have not fired a single arrow. We are no different from the people of Qin and Yue who look at each other's fat and lean. The country raises more than two million soldiers, and the annual expenditure is not small. Now that the country is in such a crisis, we are sitting by and watching the success or failure, each defending our own territory. Alas, how sad! Therefore, for the sake of the country's survival, it is imperative to rectify national defense, break the feudal ideology, actively train the soldiers of the whole country, replenish military equipment, and prepare early. There must also be a unified command so that we can unanimously resist foreign enemies without the worry of disrupting our own steps. We should also warn each other not to engage in internal strife, lest we invite foreign insults. All the martyrs who have sacrificed for the country over the years should be commended and their families should be comforted, so as to honor the meritorious and encourage the active soldiers to devote themselves to defending the country and guarding the territory. (3) Autonomy: The modern trend of autonomy is becoming more and more turbulent. Although the Three People's Principles of the Premier and the Outline of National Construction are of all kinds, they all point to democracy. Now that our party is adhering to these teachings and governing the country with the party, the policy of administration should be to implement autonomy, so that our party and country are built on the people, so as to achieve the goal of the people owning, governing, and enjoying the country. As for the village and neighborhood system, it is the fundamental basis of autonomy and should be promoted as much as possible to establish the foundation. For local construction matters, such as education, water conservancy, agriculture, industry, and hygiene, those that should be promoted and those that should be reformed should be carried out gradually. In addition, commercial groups and defense corps are necessary for self-defense and should also be organized by the local people. Once we go to war with foreign enemies, we can also prepare to defend against the enemy. Also, in recent years, disasters have been reported repeatedly, and all industries have been in decline. The number of unemployed vagrants is increasing day by day, and if they are not appeased, there will be endless troubles. Therefore, it is imperative to set up factories for vagrants and beggars to accommodate them, so that consumers can devote themselves to production. This is also an important task of autonomy. (4) Laws and Regulations: Our country has a vast territory, surpassing the globe. Customs and folk customs vary, making it difficult for legislators. It is difficult to apply the same laws and regulations to the whole country. Therefore, when legislating, we must consult widely and consider carefully, striving to suit the people's feelings and promote their interests, so that the people can enjoy the protection of the law. Otherwise, we will be making things behind closed doors, only making the people subject to the restrictions of the law and suffering from it. The unscrupulous will also manipulate the law and seek personal gain. Therefore, we must be careful when legislating, and there should be certainty. Do not change things frequently. It is better to be simple and easy to implement than to be dense and incomplete. (5) Finance: Our country's finances are tight, more so than ever. We must make great efforts to rectify them in order to cultivate the foundation of the country. For example, reorganizing domestic and foreign public debts and redrafting tax rules are the most fundamental tasks. As far as taxation is concerned, it is appropriate to increase consumption taxes and luxury taxes to enrich the national treasury (for example, the national consumption of cigarettes reaches more than 200 million yuan per year, and the current unified tax rate is 50% of the value. If we levy an additional 30%, that is, 80% of the value, we can increase tax revenue by 60 million yuan per year, which can be deposited and used for national salvation and disaster relief. Although it is said to be a heavy punishment, it will not harm the people), implement protection taxes and dumping taxes to maintain the development of industry and resist the import of foreign goods. All redundant agencies and tax collection agencies that are different in name but the same in reality should be cut to save public funds and severely punish corruption to deter others. As for the receipt and expenditure of finance, it must be absolutely open and subject to public supervision. Administrative expenses must be handled in strict compliance with the budget and must not be treated as a mere formality, so that floating expenses can be saved and there is no concealment of funds. The way to financial wealth can be expected. (6) Diplomacy: There is no justice in the world, and the country is in the midst of disaster. We should carefully select diplomatic talents and expand international diplomatic funding. We should also actively carry out international propaganda and unite with countries that treat us equally to fight together. (7) Education: Our people's intelligence is shallow due to the lack of universal education, so we should pay attention to popular education to improve the level of the people. For those who are poor, we should set up compulsory schools to accommodate them, and set up mobile schools and cram schools so that those who have lost their studies have the opportunity to be educated. We should promote old morals to build the people's psychology. As for the primary school curriculum, it must be agriculturalized and industrialized to develop the habit of hard work and endurance. Above the middle school level, it should be scientific to make learning practical and encourage military education to establish the foundation of conscription. Those who have excellent grades should be rewarded and allowed to enter middle schools and universities free of charge to encourage them and create talents. (8) Industry: Our country's industry is young and the economy is backward. If we want to become rich and strong, we must revitalize industry. The mining, shipping, fishing, and electrical industries that have already been established should be maintained by the government and should not be destroyed or nationalized. Those that have been nationalized but have been suspended or poorly managed in the middle should be returned to private ownership so that people's industries have full protection and are happy to operate. We should also encourage the financial community to invest in agricultural, industrial, and commercial industries to support their development. If the people cannot afford to do it, the government should do its best to help them succeed. If this is done for several years, the future of industry will surely be prosperous, and the people's livelihood problems can also be solved. (9) People's Food: Our country is an agricultural country, and farmers account for about 300 million people. In recent years, due to the impact of the war, there has been a shortage of food for the people, and the social economy has been exhausted. Since the floods in various provinces last year, the people's livelihood has become more difficult, and Lai Su is eager to come, so we must quickly prepare for the aftermath. We should build dikes, dredge rivers, and promote water conservancy, promote forests to regulate the climate, and guide Huai and guide the river should be carried out actively. We should also reorganize the social warehouses to prepare for famine and set up farmers' loans to benefit. If the year is good, the people will be prosperous and the country will be prosperous. (10) Thrift: Extravagance is a great scourge of society, especially since our country's industry is young, so we must be wary of extravagance. Therefore, those in power should take the lead in promoting thrift, so that those above will imitate those below and develop a simple style. The livelihood of the people of the whole country has reached the point of exhaustion. If those in power do not promote thrift, I am afraid that the national economy will be on the verge of bankruptcy. As far as politicians are concerned, it is difficult to expect them to be honest and incorruptible in this extravagant environment. The above are the few things I can see, and I respectfully ask for your public decision on whether they are appropriate.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai General Labor Union Telegraphed the National Government to Send Troops to Recover Lost Territory</h3>

(Telegram to the National Government) Yesterday, the union sent a telegram to the National Government to send troops to recover lost territory and announce a policy towards Japan. The telegram stated: "We humbly submit to the Nanjing National Government: Since the violent Japanese invaded and occupied our Northeast, they have been behaving violently for months, and their violent acts have been increasing. Our government has adopted a policy of non-resistance, causing thousands of our Chinese compatriots to become aliens, and the three provinces outside the pass have been almost completely lost. Now that the new government has been established, how should it defend the country and recover lost territory? It has been completely ignored. Therefore, Jinzhou, the first dangerous place outside the pass, has fallen again, and Tianjin, a vital town in the Central Plains, is already shaking. Our great rivers and mountains will all fall into the hands of the violent enemy. The news has spread, and we are filled with pain and indignation. How can the rulers face our people? This union respectfully represents the 800,000 workers of the city and does not want to sit idly by and watch the old China with thousands of years of history be handed over to the short-statured slaves, and all 400 million compatriots become bodies of a destroyed nation. We are sending this telegram again to urge you to quickly send elite troops to recover lost territory and to clearly announce your policy towards Japan to dispel all doubts. We urgently await your orders. Respectfully, the Shanghai General Labor Union, Kou, Qi."</p>
<h3>The Pawnshop Association Provides Funds to Ma Zhanshan</h3>

<h3>Robbery of More Than a Thousand Dollars in a Hail of Bullets</h3>
<p>Robbers Had Prearranged</p>
<p>Stole a Box of Wages</p>
<p>The Japanese-owned Xihe Cotton Mill on Robert Road in western Shanghai was preparing to distribute wages at about 3:10 AM yesterday (the 8th) when a large number of robbers suddenly appeared in a hail of bullets and robbed 1,744 yuan in cash. The details of the incident are recorded below:</p>
<p>Mill Situation: The Japanese-owned Xihe Cotton Mill on Robert Road, near the Suzhou Creek in western Shanghai, formerly known as Baocheng Cotton Mill, has been taken over by Japanese businessmen and is divided into factories 1, 2, 3, and 4. The factory covers a wide area and the internal equipment is quite magnificent. There are more than 4,000 male and female workers in the four factories. Business has been very developed in recent years. Although it has suffered considerable losses due to the impact of boycotts, it has endured the pain and continued to operate as usual.</p>
<p>Wage Distribution: The mill is large in scale and has many workers. As a rule, wages are distributed on the first and fifteenth days of the lunar calendar. Day workers are distributed during the day, and night workers are distributed at midnight. Yesterday happened to be the date of wage distribution. At about 3:00 AM (that is, in the second half of the night), the accountant of the mill first finished distributing wages to the night workers in Factory 1 and led the porters to carry four wooden boxes containing more than 10,000 yuan in cash, intending to distribute them in Factories 2, 3, and 4 in turn.</p>
<p>Hail of Bullets: Factories 1 and 2 are only separated by a road. As the porters carried the wooden boxes on their shoulders and had just left the factory gate, suddenly in the dark, gunshots rang out in the distance, and bullets rained down, hitting one after another. The porters were all frightened. They saw a large number of robbers holding mortar guns swarming in. The volunteer police of the mill and the police of the Sixth District nearby heard the sound and rushed to open fire with pistols and bombard the crowd. For a time, there was a hail of bullets on both sides, with as many as sixty or seventy shots. However, the robbers had superior firepower and actually robbed two wooden boxes and dared to resist arrest. The police also tried their best to disregard their own safety and fired as they pursued. Seeing the situation was urgent, the robbers abandoned one box on the ground and robbed one box (the box contained at least 1,744 yuan). They fled in the dark, and fortunately no one was injured.</p>
<p>Unsuccessful Pursuit: The chief of the Sixth District, Ren Lixing, heard the alarm and immediately led Inspector Xu and a large number of police officers to the scene. It happened that Officer Gu of the first police station in charge was leading the police to pursue the robbers. They immediately joined forces to encircle and pursue the robbers. However, at that time, the weather was cold and the night was dark, and the area was remote. The robbers had fled far away without a trace. Until dawn, more than twenty bullet casings were found on the ground outside the factory. After Ren District Chief conducted a detailed inspection, the factory opened a list to report to the署. Ren District Chief immediately ordered the resident detective team and the affiliated police station chiefs and police to apprehend the stolen goods and robbers within a limited time, without delay.</p>
<h3>City Detective Team Arrested Eleven Kidnappers</h3>
<p>Disguised as Travelers with Families Opening Rooms</p>
<p>Surveilled Movements and Arrested Zhang Xinfu</p>
<p>The captain of the city's detective team, Lu Ying, received a secret report the other day, saying that a large number of kidnappers were hiding in the Changxing Hotel at 281-283 Caishi Street and the Nanyang Hotel at 94 Xixinqiao Street next door in the French Concession. One of the bandits, named Zhang Xinfu (nickname "Little Cobbler," from Zhenjiang), was the mastermind behind the kidnapping of Zhang Xiaoliang, the owner of the Jiu Ji Timber Firm on Jichang Street in the Nanshi District, last year. Please send personnel to arrest them as soon as possible. After hearing the report, Captain Lu secretly dispatched a detective the night before, accompanied by his female family members, disguised as a traveler to the Changxing Hotel, opened room 22, and surveyed the movements of these people. Until about 11:00 PM last night, Captain Lu personally led the entire team of detectives, together with the detectives from the French Concession Police, to encircle and arrest them. Eight people were arrested in room 54 of the Changxing Hotel, and three people were intercepted in Nanyang. "Little Cobbler" Zhang Xinfu was indeed among them. They were immediately taken to the police station. After a brief interrogation by the police chief, Captain Lu took them to the Public Security Bureau and detained them for detailed interrogation.</p>
<h3>Fire Department Personnel Assist in Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>Mr. Ai Laijun, a supervisor of the Shanghai Municipal Council Fire Department, has recently been granted early leave by the Municipal Council at the request of Mr. Simpson, the general manager of the National Flood Relief Committee, so that he can help with disaster relief work. Mr. Ai Laijun has been working in the Fire Department for several years and is about to take a long vacation, which is only two months away. Therefore, Mr. Simpson asked the Bureau to grant him early leave so that he could help inspect the disaster areas in the Yangtze and Huai River basins, which would be of great benefit to the disaster relief work.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Announces Reward Measures for Commercially Operated Vegetable Markets</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government previously stated that the urban population is growing and the existing municipal and commercially operated vegetable markets are insufficient to meet the needs of the citizens. It had ordered the six bureaus of Public Security, Public Works, Social Affairs, Health, Land, and Finance to form a Vegetable Market Construction Committee to comprehensively plan and add vegetable markets for supply. It is now heard that the committee, in order to promote the construction of vegetable markets by businessmen, decided at its seventeenth standing committee meeting to formulate eight articles of reward measures for commercially operated vegetable markets in Shanghai to provide full protection for businessmen who invest in the construction of vegetable markets. It has now been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval and promulgation. In the future, when the construction of vegetable markets in the city is completed, all floating stalls on the roads will be incorporated, and citizens will have a fixed place to buy vegetables, which is also a good news for the convenience of the people. The reward measures are recorded below: Article 1: Citizens who apply to the Vegetable Market Construction Committee for approval to invest in the construction of vegetable markets in the city, in addition to complying with the rules for banning hawkers jointly established by the four bureaus of this city and paying vegetable market donations, may apply the provisions of these measures. Article 2: When citizens apply to build a vegetable market, the Vegetable Market Construction Committee will discuss the needs of the location and designate the supply area for users. Article 3: After the vegetable market is completed and reported to the competent bureau for acceptance and approval to open, all floating stalls set up on the roads near the vegetable market will be investigated by the Public Security and Finance Bureaus and ordered to move into the vegetable market to operate. Subsequently, stallholders are not allowed to set up vegetable stalls in the designated area. Article 4: Stallholders should pay the monthly rent of the stall as approved by the government on a monthly basis and must not be in arrears. If the stall rent is in arrears for three months, the vegetable market may report to the Public Security Bureau to send police to expel them and recover the owed stall rent, and may also apply to the Public Security Bureau for police escorts to maintain order in the vegetable market in accordance with the rules for hiring police escorts. Article 5: In case of necessity for sanitation matters in the vegetable market, the Health Bureau may be requested to provide free facilities. If stallholders have injuries or diseases, the vegetable market can issue a certificate and also enjoy the most preferential treatment for treatment stipulated by the Health Bureau. Article 6: The tap water used for washing the vegetable market may be calculated at the lowest price in accordance with the preferential measures for water use by public institutions. The Public Utilities Bureau shall order the water company to comply. Article 7: These measures may be amended at any time if there are supplementary matters. Article 8: These measures shall be implemented from the date of approval by the Municipal Government.</p>
<h3>Progress of Business in the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau</h3>

<h3>Women's Temperance Society Aids Beggar Children</h3>
<p>Six More Recruited Yesterday</p>
<p>There are always a large number of beggar children at the Waibaidu Bridge in the Shanghai Public Concession, appearing every day, with their faces and figures haggard, dirty and unbearable, in the name of helping to pull rickshaws, and in fact extorting hard-earned money. Pedestrians often feel their suffering, and the authorities do not prohibit it. The Women's Temperance Society, in view of this, and also feeling that if no measures are taken to help these beggar children, it would not only be inhumane, but also harmful to the national system and the people's livelihood, specially sent Li Acai, a beggar child who had been taken back from the bridge for education, to guide the recruiting staff to the beggar's den. The beggar children saw that he was an old friend, and that Acai was well-dressed, and that his behavior was different from before, so they were quite envious. Six beggar children, Fan Azhong, Tong Zhejiang, etc., were willing to abandon their begging life. It is reported that after the beggar children entered the education institute, they have been cleaned up and renewed, and Ms. Liu Wang Liming, the director of the association, personally went to instruct them. In the morning, they enter the Peigong Elementary School in the institute, and in the afternoon, they learn sock weaving and other crafts.</p>
<h3>Real Estate Association Studies Tap Water Meter Issues</h3>
<p>A reporter from the Guowen News Agency met with Mr. Li Bohan, a standing committee member of the Shanghai Real Estate Association, yesterday to inquire about the recent situation of tap water issues. Mr. Li said, "The dispute between users and the company after the tap water price increase has lasted for more than a year. Now that the pound exchange rate is gradually increasing, the proposal for a second price increase mentioned by the chairman of the water company's shareholders meeting will of course be dismissed, and the proposal to reconsider when the exchange rate reaches two shillings will be realized soon. However, since this is not a permanent solution, it is not the ultimate goal of this association. The abstract of the report by Mr. Hill, the tap water expert hired by the Public Works Bureau, repeatedly stated that the water company's payment of dividends in pounds indirectly causes users to bear the exchange rate risk, which is not appropriate, and is the same as the proposal that this association made to the water company to adopt a silver plan. However, Mr. Hill's estimation method for calculating the water company's property is still difficult to justify. In addition, the water company recently sent a letter to this association proposing a water meter system. A specialized committee has studied this in detail, and another general meeting will be held in the near future to discuss it at length, because its advantages and disadvantages are deeply related to the future water price." The reporter also asked for his opinion on the interim measures for water prices. Mr. Li said, "This association has repeatedly corrected the water company's collection of water charges based on gross rent, which is illegal and unreasonable. The company has now followed the advice to improve. In the future, owners who collect and pay water prices for small companies should calculate based on the net rent received."</p>
<h3>Commendable Bravery of Detectives in Arresting Thieves</h3>
<p>Zhu Shende, a native of Ningbo, lives by setting up a money exchange stall in the Penglu small vegetable market, and lives at 31 Chunyang Lane, Youheng Road, Sikaizi Bridge. At about 6:30 last night, Zhu and his wife and daughter were having dinner in the living room when five thieves suddenly broke in. Two of them were holding pistols and ordered everyone not to move. One of the thieves immediately stepped forward and took off the wristwatch and gold ring worn on Zhu's daughter's wrist. Three of the thieves went directly upstairs and went straight into the bedroom to search and rob. Zhu Shende took advantage of the thieves' unpreparedness and escaped from the front station to call the police. At that time, Zheng Huaili, a detective from the Jiaxing Road Police Station residing in the pavilion building, was in the room and saw the thieves hurriedly going upstairs. He asked them what they were busy with. The thieves answered that they wanted to talk to the landlord. Zheng knew that something was wrong, so he put on his clothes and waited with a gun. Soon, the thieves went downstairs in a staggering manner because they had found nothing to rob. Zheng also followed them downstairs. The thieves fled in all directions to the front and back households. Zheng followed the three thieves from the back door to the vicinity of the里口. The thieves had become aware and resisted. Detective Zheng immediately fired three shots, hitting one of the thieves in the abdomen. He was arrested on the spot, and the remaining four thieves fled. The police who had been called by Zhu pursued, but nothing was gained.</p>
<h3>Encounter with Thieves While Remitting Money at the Post Office</h3>
<p>Arrested by Police on the Spot</p>
<p>Thief Sentenced to Two Years of Penal Servitude</p>
<p>A clerk surnamed Shi from the Kang酒廠 on Gongguan Road, sent apprentice Wu Lianghao (16 years old) to remit 40 yuan to Zhenjiang the day before. At about 2:00 PM that afternoon, Wu was holding the banknotes and went to the post office on Tianzhutang Street to pay for the remittance. When he arrived inside the post office gate, he was spotted by Ningbo rascal Yang Decheng, who came up from behind and snatched the banknotes from Wu's hand and ran out the door. He fled south along Tianzhutang Street. Wu chased after him, shouting loudly for a robber. The police officer on duty at station 137 heard the sound and rushed to arrest Yang. Yang threw away the banknotes and fled to the intersection of Yong'an Street. The Chinese policeman from number 569 and the Western policeman from number 155 came on patrol and intercepted Yang. The policeman from number 137 retrieved the banknotes and took them to the police station together. Yesterday afternoon, they were sent to the First Tribunal of the Second Special Court for investigation. First, the police lawyer Gu Shouxi stated the case and prosecuted him for robbery under Article 343 of the Criminal Code. Wu Lianghao also stated the situation of the robbery, and Chinese and Western police officers testified about the situation of chasing and arresting the defendant. Yang Decheng, who was 18 years old and worked in the printing industry, confessed that he was unemployed and poor and had no choice but to rob the plaintiff's banknotes. Judge Ge Zhiqin verified the confession and ordered the police lawyer to debate. He then announced the end of the trial and sentenced the defendant to two years of penal servitude for the crime of robbery. The number of days of detention before the judgment was determined to be offset by one day of penal servitude for two days. The 40 yuan in banknotes were returned to Wu Lianghao to be taken away.</p>
<h3>Continued News of the Yong'an Tragedy</h3>
<p>Court Once Held Preliminary Hearing</p>
<p>Shen Yongming, Jin Yaowen, and other union directors and workers, totaling 13 people, were arrested and detained by the local court and the Public Security Bureau for the tragedy that occurred in the Yong'an Second Factory in Wusong. Because the company manager Peng Shun accused Shen and others of robbery and damage, etc., after the local court accepted the case, it ordered Peng and more than ten employees to go to the court yesterday. In the afternoon, Prosecutor Shen opened a court for preliminary hearing. The factory accused the directors and others of leading rioters to rob silver dollars, damage the entire factory, injure and kill workers, etc., while the directors and others claimed that the factory completely killed the workers and caused the tragedy, and claimed that the robbery and damage were false accusations. As a result of the trial, Shen Yongming and others were still taken back to detention.</p>
<h3>A Concubine Dismissed by Zhu Jinhou Requests Confirmation of Paternity of Her Daughter</h3>
<p>Issue in Dispute: Fosterage vs. Biological Parentage</p>
<p>Zhu Jinhou, a salt merchant from Jing County, Anhui, resides at No. 123 Goden Road in Shanghai's western district. He possesses assets worth millions. In the 17th year of the Republic (1928), Zhu was visiting Suzhou when he met Qinglou (originally named Tang Peizhen, currently 22 years old), a courtesan who advertised her services in the Minqingli district of the city gate. Zhu fell in love at first sight and negotiated with the madam to take her as a concubine. An agreement was soon reached, and in the summer of that year, Zhu married Tang as his concubine. He built a gilded residence at No. 8 Zhang Guolao Lane in Suzhou as a place to house his beauty. After living together for over a year, their love suddenly soured, leading to litigation. Tang first sued Zhu for abuse in the Provisional Court. Zhu counter-sued Tang for fleeing with a female child. Following mediation by friends, the lawsuits were dropped, but they separated. An agreement was signed to terminate their relationship as husband and concubine. Zhu paid Tang five thousand yuan as alimony. The agreement was notarized by lawyers Tao Jiachun and Liu Zuwang. The agreement also stated that the daughter Tang was raising (named Pan Jin, four years old) was a foster daughter and was also to be separated from the relationship. Now, Tang has hired lawyer Wu Baoheng to sue Zhu Jinhou in the First Special Court, claiming that Pan Jin is Zhu's biological daughter, requesting confirmation of Pan Jin's parentage. Yesterday morning, Zhou Daren, the civil division chief of the Special Court, opened the Civil Court No. 8 for inquiry. Zhu Jinhou did not attend, but appointed lawyer Qin Liankui to represent him. Tang Peizhen testified, stating that she was 22 years old, from Suzhou, residing at No. 424 Dagu Road. On February 17th at age nineteen, she married the defendant as a concubine and gave birth to Pan Jin on November 13th, who is now four years old. Judge Zhou asked Tang when she became a prostitute. She replied, "At twelve years old." He asked, "Before marrying the defendant, did you have any physical relations with anyone else?" She replied, "Before I was married, I was still a little girl." He asked, "When did you conceive?" She replied, "February 17th." He asked, "Did you have any relations with Zhu before the marriage?" She replied, "In the first month, yes." He asked, "When did your menstrual cycle stop?" She replied, "February 12th." Judge Zhou then questioned lawyer Qin regarding the plaintiff's statements. Lawyer Qin stated that, according to his client, the girl was not his biological daughter, but was brought by the plaintiff when she married the defendant. He did not know her name or origin, hence the reference to her as a foster daughter in the separation agreement. Therefore, he could not acknowledge her. Judge Zhou then announced that the case would be rescheduled for further hearing. At the next hearing, Zhu Jinhou must appear in court, and Zhu Pan Jin must also be brought to the court.</p>
<h3>Wanchang Rice Mill Launches Nutritious Rice for Sale</h3>
<p>Contains Vitamins</p>
<p>Wanchang Rice Mill, located west of the Eight Immortals Bridge in the French Concession, considers rice an essential staple, and the most important nutrient for the human body is vitamins, followed by protein and fat. The outer layer of rice is rich in vitamins. However, people only seek clean, palatable rice, forgetting the nutritional elements. Rice mills cater to this preference for whiteness, removing the outer layer, causing the loss of vitamins, and leading to diseases like beriberi, stomach, and intestinal problems. The owner of Wanchang Mill, recognizing this, has collaborated with health experts to preserve the vitamins during the milling process, naming it "Nutritious Rice." Its advantages are as follows: (1) Rice Quality: Generally, early rice is excessively loose, and late rice is excessively sticky. Nutritious Rice is blended using appropriate methods to achieve a balance. It is neither loose nor sticky. (2) Rice Color: Specially refined to retain vitamins, it also has a very white appearance, completely identical to the so-called "top-grade white rice" of the past. (3) Efficacy: Nutritious Rice is easily digested in the stomach. In addition to vitamins, it is also rich in protein and fat, preventing beriberi and stomach ailments, while nourishing the body. (4) Affordable: Cheaper than top-grade rice on the market, while having completely equivalent quality, and even more beneficial. (5) Cooking Method: The process is completely the same as with other white rice, except that it is best to rinse the rice one hour in advance. This Nutritious Rice is now available for sale at the factory's retail outlet. You can also place an order by phone at 83036, and it can be delivered.</p>

After Wu Tiecheng assumed the position of mayor, he recommended Mai Chaoshu to the Executive Yuan as the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, scheduled to assume office on the 11th.

<h3>Zheng Baozhao's New Initiatives</h3>
<p>Admonishing Staff to Rectify Railway Affairs</p>
<p>Zheng Baozhao, the head of the traffic departments of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, has held firm on his determination to rectify railway affairs since assuming office, striving to commercialize the railway. Fearing negligence among staff, he issued a strict admonishment to his subordinates yesterday. He stated that railways are a public utility, and their sole responsibility is to facilitate convenient and comfortable travel and promote commerce. All traffic employees, especially those directly related to the operations, must strive to maintain the cleanliness and hygiene of trains and stations, ensure comfortable travel, and meet all transport needs. They should provide full convenience. When encountering inquiries from passengers and merchants, they should respond sincerely. If passengers and merchants are unfamiliar with the rules and regulations, they should explain them gently and avoid any negligence or intentional obstruction. Even if matters are important and beyond their authority, they should promptly report the actual situation to their superiors for review. It is essential to recognize that the development of commerce and the enhancement of railways depend on thorough cooperation and understanding between the railway and the business community. This can only be achieved if all traffic employees, from top to bottom, share this understanding and work together. The office has repeatedly issued strict admonishments, and while employees have shown some awareness, they inevitably relapse into old habits over time. Therefore, this notice is issued again, urging everyone to comply. Those in charge at all levels must earnestly supervise and oversee. If negligence persists, once reported or discovered by this office, it will be strictly investigated without leniency.</p>
<h3>Resolution of the Shipping Strike at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company</h3>
<p>Many Ships Halted, Disrupting Passenger and Freight Transport</p>
<p>Daily Losses Exceed 10,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The crew, stewards, stokers, and sailors of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company demanded double pay, which was rejected by Guo Waifeng, triggering a strike. The news was reported yesterday. Although Guo sent representatives to negotiate with the crew, the strike has not been resolved because of the lack of a solid plan. Ships returning to Shanghai on the Yangtze River have joined the strike, taking united action. It is said that both sides have asked Du Yuesheng to mediate, and it is hoped that this issue will be discussed today. The news from yesterday is summarized below.</p>
<p>United Action by Six Departments Yesterday morning, the crew of the ships that went on strike convened a general meeting of all staff from the driving department, engine department, pilot department, steward department, stoker department, and sailor department to discuss their course of action. It was decided on the spot that the staff of the six departments would adopt a united stance. They would continue to perform their duties on board as usual, and would only resume sailing once the requested double pay was received. Before the double pay was issued, no staff member was allowed to negotiate with the company privately. Anyone who resumed sailing privately, disrupting the collective action, would be regarded as a public enemy and would be responsible for the total amount of the double pay. On the spot, the six departments separately drafted a contract for joint action, with each signing and sealing the contract to demonstrate their determination. Petition to the Municipal Government and Party Headquarters After the meeting, representatives from the six departments went to the Municipal Government's Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Party Headquarters to request assistance and explain that the strike was a last resort. They submitted a petition, which was accepted by the Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Party Headquarters. They were advised to maintain order and refrain from any actions that deviated from the norm. The representatives were satisfied. The original text of their petition is as follows: Petition for Reporting the Matter: It is known that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is notorious for its long-standing malpractices. Although it has been reorganized by the National Government, and three commissioners have been replaced, with the purpose of reorganization announced to the people, those in power have other intentions. They treat the company staff and crew unfairly. For example, at the end of each year, the company staff routinely receive double pay, but the crew alone is excluded. Moreover, there are special bonuses and various bonus schemes. Comparing the two, the company staff receive almost three months' salary more than the crew in a year. Some staff members, even if employed for only four months, with two months of sick leave, can still receive five months' salary. This is just one example, and the rest can be inferred. Therefore, the crew believes that the discrimination is excessive, and the demand for double pay is not excessive. In addition to verbal requests, written requests have been made for two years. Most recently, in November of last year, a letter was sent to the company requesting double pay, and Mr. Li Shenzheng also made the request to the company on behalf of the crew. All were unreasonably rejected by the company. As a last resort, on the 7th of this month, the crew elected representatives to petition the company. Commissioner Guo firmly refused, saying that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is a mess, and he, Guo, would not last long and would soon close the company. Even if he had to sacrifice his position, he would not be able to treat everyone equally. Commissioner Guo has other motives, placing the crew in a desperate situation, leaving them with no means of livelihood. For the sake of dignity and justice, the crew has resolved to continue their daily work as usual, while awaiting the company to issue double pay, and will immediately sail to various ports. There will be no other actions. Therefore, this document is prepared to report the matter, hoping for your review and consideration for the public good.</p>
<p>Company Representatives Negotiate Yesterday morning, Guo Waifeng arrived at the company. Seeing that the strike was growing and the situation was dangerous, he convened a company meeting to discuss the response. Guo entrusted Li Zhenwu, Xie Baosheng, and Yang Ying to negotiate with the crew representatives at the driving department. They stated that Guo Waifeng regretted his rash remarks the previous day, which led to the strike. However, regarding the crew's request for double pay, he could agree in principle, but because the company was in financial difficulty, he proposed that the company issue the crew a half-month bonus instead. He also requested that the ships resume sailing. The crew refused to change the double pay to a bonus and stated that they would set sail as soon as the payment was issued. No resolution was reached. Request for Du Yuesheng's Mediation This matter has been ongoing for two days without a resolution. The crew insisted that they would not resume sailing until their goal was achieved. Yesterday afternoon, after intermediaries ran around and negotiated, the crew publicly elected representatives Xu Wenfang and Qian Yuzhu, etc., to take a public letter from all the staff to Du Yuesheng and Xie Baosheng, requesting them to mediate. The letter stated that the company discriminated against the crew and treated them unfairly. Yesterday, the crew requested double pay, but Commissioner Guo refused, leaving the crew in a desperate situation. It was recently heard that someone was trying to undermine the strike by accusing it of some crime. For the sake of dignity, the crew had no choice but to persevere. They requested Mr. Du to mediate. It is said that Mr. Du Yuesheng has agreed to the crew's request and has agreed to mediate, and will consult with the company officials today to find a peaceful resolution.</p>
<p>Business Losses One Aspect The ships that initially went on strike numbered twelve. Yesterday, the Yangtze River ships Jiangda and Jiangyu, sailing from Hankou to Shanghai, joined the strike upon arriving in Shanghai, taking united action. There are now five Yangtze River ships and nine ocean-going ships that have suspended operations. According to insiders, the resulting business losses are estimated at 13,000 to 14,000 yuan per day. In the past two days, the losses have already exceeded 20,000 yuan. Yesterday, the Xinming and other ships scheduled to depart could not set sail.</p>
<p>Jiangyu Granted Special Military Transport The Jiangyu, which arrived yesterday, was also within the scope of the strike. Later, a telegram was received from the Central Government, ordering the ship to load officers and soldiers from a division stationed in Hangzhou in Shanghai and transport them to Hankou. The division had already been transferred from Hangzhou and could not be delayed. The crew reported this to the association and requested instructions. The association decided that the matter concerned military transport, which could not be delayed. Although it was during the strike, permission should be granted to set sail. With the consent of everyone, the Jiangyu was able to transport the Fourth Division to Hankou. The other thirteen ships were not allowed to sail freely. If the company still insisted, the association was prepared to send representatives to Beijing to petition the National Government.</p>
<p>Crew's Second Declaration The crew's Double Pay Petition Group's second declaration stated that the crew had requested fair treatment from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company through both verbal and written means, but they had been ignored. As a last resort, they launched a petition and declared the circumstances, requesting public judgment. However, the company's baseless arguments have not yet been addressed. They are now being published together as follows. The company's only argument is that the crew's treatment is superior to that of the company staff. However, in reality, the opposite is true. The crew is now publishing the salary figures of both the company staff and the crew for comparison. The public can judge for themselves which is better. The company's commissioner's salary is 600 yuan, with 400 yuan for public expenses. A section chief's salary is 400 yuan, with 200 yuan for public expenses. A deputy section chief's salary is 300 yuan. An engineer's salary is 320 to 360 yuan. A secretary's salary is 300 to 350 yuan. A staff member's salary is 50 to 200 yuan. An advisor's salary ranges from 300 to 400 yuan. The crew's salary is as follows: Captain's salary is 300 to 500 yuan. First mate's salary is 130 to 190 yuan. Second mate's salary is 80 to 130 yuan. Chief engineer's salary is 130 to 180 yuan. Second engineer's salary is 80 to 130 yuan. Third engineer's salary is 80 yuan. Fourth engineer's salary is 50 yuan. Boatswain and helmsman's salary is 42 to 44 yuan. Foreman and fireman's salary is 42 to 44 yuan. Fireman's salary is 37 yuan. All stewards earn only 140 to 160 yuan. Based on the above table, it is obvious which is better. Moreover, the company has five first-class positions, including commissioner, section chief, deputy section chief, engineer, secretary, and advisor. The crew has three: captain, first mate, and chief engineer. How do they compare with the company? For second- and third-class positions, the crew has second mate and second engineer, while the company has staff members. How do they compare? Regarding medical care, the company has a dedicated doctor and a medical department. Company staff and crew should be treated equally. Furthermore, company staff can hold multiple jobs and receive multiple salaries, and even engage in businesses. However, the crew sacrifices family happiness and social status in exchange for a meager salary, barely enough to make ends meet. The company's expenses are covered by the work of these people who barely make ends meet. Yet, it is said that they are not entitled to the same treatment as the company staff. Is there any justice in the world? Therefore, the crew cannot but publicize the facts to request fair criticism and assistance from the National Government to all industries and sectors. Finally, the crew solemnly declares that the reason for disclosing the salary figures is only for comparison purposes to silence the doubters. They have no complaints about the salary levels of any company staff members. Please do not misunderstand. Declaration.</p>

<h3>Publication of "Zhi Dao Xin Chuan"</h3>
<p>The book "Zhi Dao Xin Chuan" was orally transmitted by Zheng Siyuan, a disciple of Ge Xianweng, and recorded by Liu Wenbin. There was a carved version during the Ming Dynasty, but it is extremely rare today and cannot be bought for less than several tens of dollars.

Fearing its loss, it is now being reprinted for publication by the Meibaige Road Medical Bookstore. The price is 30 cents per copy, plus 4 cents for postage. Mr. Jiang Zhuzhuang said, "When I was young, I loved to study Taoism and read no fewer than hundreds of Taoist books. Most of them were vague in wording and deliberately obscure, making it difficult for people to understand. Only the book 'Zhi Dao Xin Chuan' is truthful in every word, with absolutely no concealment. If scholars follow it and practice accordingly, they can progress step by step without going astray. It is a raft for saving the world, and students of Taoism should each have a copy."</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the esteemed editor:</p>
<p>I am writing to you regarding the news item "Tragic Love Affair with a Fan" in your esteemed newspaper. It stated that the owner of Dafeng Embroidery Shop at No. 223 Donggong Lane, Fuzhou Road, was enjoying the cool evening breeze in front of the shop on the third day of the fifth month of the lunar calendar. I would like to clarify that Dafeng Embroidery Shop was founded by my brother, Bingting, and myself, and has been in business for over ten years. I have never been involved in any improper affairs and have no connection with the case. Jiang Gongyu is also unrelated to the shop owner. Fearing that this may cause misunderstandings, I have specially written this letter to request your esteemed newspaper to make a correction to ensure accuracy and prevent damage to our reputation. I would be most grateful.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Tao Yumen of Dafeng Embroidery</p>

<h3>Reader Correspondence</h3>
<p>Three Answers: The National Government Must Be True to Its Name; I Do Not Support Strikes</p>
<p>Trying Out Small Industries: Wang Maoxun</p>
<p>1. Regarding political reform, the politics of the past were still corrupt, which is undeniable. The first and most important thing to do now is to make the National Government live up to its name. Since the establishment of the National Government, how much power have we, the people, actually participated in? How many meetings have been attended by the people? Has our public opinion been adopted? Do we, the people, have the freedom of speech? Therefore, I think the most important thing is to make it true to its name. From now on, the people should participate in a part of the power, and the people should also be qualified to participate in most of the meetings. It is necessary to adopt public opinion and effectively protect the people's freedom of expression. This is what is meant by a real national government. In addition, diplomacy should be transparent, so as not to make the people fall into a fog and not to deceive the people, so that the people lose faith in the government. In addition, the people should have the right to expose officials, whether they are corrupt officials, new warlords, or traitors. As long as they are recognized by the public, the people have the right to eliminate them.</p>
<p>2. Regarding student work, I am a student myself, and I support not striking. Strikes are certainly a sign of high public morale, but I do not support this kind of expression. We must express it in practice. The Prussian army in "The Last Lesson" is already sounding the horn, but the students are still in class. We can know that they were in class before the Prussian army occupied it, and they were also in class during the war. If there is no such calmness, "The Last Lesson" would not be so famous. If there were no such stimulus, France would never have recovered Alsace-Lorraine. I think that for students, there is no more important work than studying. However, studying is definitely not just rote learning. For example, those who study commerce should, when the country is in trouble, desperately study the enemy's commerce and what kind of Chinese goods can be sold well in the Japanese market, and how to make Chinese goods sell well in the international market. Those who study liberal arts should study Japanese culture and other cultural undertakings. As for those who study engineering, they should study science and new weapons to kill the Japanese bandits. In addition, agricultural science and other subjects should all study their own subjects. Now is the time to study, and in the end, everyone will work together to resist the Japanese bandits.</p>
<p>3. Regarding the manufacturing of national goods, regarding this point, I have several classmates who have already engaged in the development of small industries. Now they have raised 1,000 yuan to try it out. First, they will weave belts, shoelaces, and other various shoelaces. In addition, several classmates are preparing to manufacture electrical condensers and ore and other radio parts, because most of the ore and electrical appliances are enemy goods. Enemy goods are cheaper than European and American goods, and our country does not imitate them, and even if they are sold, the price is too high. They are planning (I am also a member). As for whether they can succeed, that is another question. As for other various small industries, as well as enemy goods that are sold well in our country, our country really needs such industrial products. I hope that the people of the country will quickly get up and imitate them and seize the position of enemy goods. (C)</p>

<h3>Fortunately, There Are National Goods Stores on Nanjing Road</h3>
<p>Walking west from Huangpu Road to the New World, the address numbers indicate that there are a total of 651 stores. Of course, these 651 stores are all kinds of glittering and resplendent shops on Nanjing Road.</p>
<p>Among these 651 stores, purely national goods stores, in terms of clothing, there are only three cotton weaving companies: Sanyou, Samsung, and Anlu. In terms of food, there are only three dim sum shops: Bei Wanxin, Wufangzhai, and Shen Dacheng; two Shaoxing wine shops: Wang Baohe and Wang Yuhe; and three tea and meat shops: Maoshenghe, Bei Wanyouquan, and Jinlan. In addition, there are Darentang Chinese medicine store and Shidezhi medicinal water store, Shuanglong tea shop. In terms of daily necessities, there are only three Jiangxi porcelain shops: Jianhua, Lihua, and Jingde; Chen Jiageng Rubber Shoe Company; and Yichangheng Carpet Shop. In terms of consumables, there are only Guang Shenghang and Pinzhen antique shop. Altogether, there are only 21 stores, which is a percentage of 3.2% out of 651. In addition, there are a few stores that are mostly purely national goods, but unfortunately, they also sell a few imported goods, such as restaurants selling foreign wine, candy stores selling foreign sugar, and fruit stores selling foreign fruit, so they are not included. Perhaps this statistic has omissions and is not entirely accurate, but even the stores listed above inevitably have some foreign elements, such as the cotton used in cotton weaving factories and the flour used in dim sum shops, which are probably still foreign raw materials. If we seriously distinguish them, the national goods stores on such a large Nanjing Road are probably as rare as morning stars. On the contrary, those who purely sell foreign goods probably account for the absolute majority.</p>
<p>According to statistics in 1930 (Republic 19), the total import of rice was 7,138,406 piculs, kerosene was 26,209,028 American gallons, cotton was 2,719,660 piculs, cotton yarn was 8,453 piculs, flour was 223,671 piculs, cigarettes were 1,895,245 (unit: thousand) sticks, coal was 865,365 tons, and sugar was 1,740,228 piculs. As for the import value of Shanghai Port alone, it was a total of 470,231,624 customs taels, while the export value was 312,667,646 customs taels. The trade deficit should be 157,563,978 customs taels. Observing from the above figures, Shanghai is truly a large market for consuming foreign goods. Shanghai people are truly big customers who support foreigners.</p>

<h3>Borrowing Authority</h3>
<p>The factory bell rang, and I slowly walked out of the factory. Countless brothers crowded around me, all heading to their respective residences. From afar, I saw a group of people gathered on the roadside. I thought it must be a monkey show, but when I got closer, I realized that it was a White Russian and a rickshaw puller arguing.</p>
<p>"You rode in my rickshaw and didn't pay. What's the meaning of that?" The rickshaw puller grabbed the Russian's arm and sternly questioned him. The White Russian pretended to have the dignity of a proud gentleman, ignored the rickshaw puller, shook off his hand, and walked away. The rickshaw puller became even more angry and rushed forward to grab him again and ask him for money.</p>
<p>"You are really unreasonable. Why don't you pay for the ride?" I was watching from the sidelines and felt somewhat indignant, so I couldn't help but say this.</p>
<p>"Beat him! This is outrageous!" The onlookers shouted. The White Russian saw that the situation was not good and hurriedly took out two dimes from his pocket and threw them on the ground, glaring angrily at the rickshaw puller and me.</p>
<p>"Where are you from? What do you do?" He seemed to want to be impolite to me. At this time, the eyes of the onlookers all turned to me.</p>
<p>"I am Chinese! I am a Chinese worker!"</p>
<p>I said, raising my head to face him.</p>
<p>"I am a Britisher! Do you know that?" The White Russian said this and walked away.</p>
<p>He probably wanted to borrow the authority of the world's great powers to scare me and the general onlookers, but everyone unanimously let out a scornful laugh... "Tch"... "Tch"... "Tch".</p>
<h3>North Wind, Yi Nong</h3>
<p>North wind, north wind...</p>
<p>Why are you so cruel!</p>
<p>Why are you so stubborn and fierce!</p>
<p>You have already blown through my front screen,</p>
<p>Why do you want to invade my defenseless sickbed?</p>
<p>North wind, north wind...</p>
<p>Are you really heartless?</p>
<p>Can you not have pity on my sick body? (My sick body is probably the sick body of our country)</p>
<p>North wind...</p>
<p>You are truly hideous and cruel.</p>
<p>You have no pity on my sick body.</p>
<p>Not only do you not pity my sickness,</p>
<p>But you also want to end my remaining life!</p>
<p>North wind...</p>
<p>Why do you have to be so fierce!</p>
<p>You should know that you are only taking advantage of the season.</p>
<p>Please tell me, when summer comes, where can your power and whereabouts be seen again?</p>

<h3>The People's Science Teacher</h3>
<p>What kind of world is it now? It is a motor world, an electrical world, an aviation world, a manufacturing world. In a word, it is a scientific world.</p>
<p>What kind of China is China? It is a poor China, a weak China, a China with low knowledge, a China with thin ability. In a word, it is a scientifically backward China.</p>
<p>A scientifically backward China must quickly promote science and strive to study science. To study science, you must recognize many teachers. Where are the teachers of science? The teachers of science are everywhere.</p>
<p>Confucius had no permanent teacher. He asked about everything when he entered the Grand Temple, and every event became his teacher. He also said, "When three men are walking together, there must be one who can teach me." If there is one teacher among three people, then how many teachers do we have!</p>
<p>As long as we are humble, not only is everyone our teacher, but all things are our teachers. There is a gourd at home, and the gourd is the teacher. There is a bird in the tree, and the bird is the teacher. There is a clock hanging on the wall, and the clock is the teacher. There is a teapot on the table, and the teapot is also the teacher. There are wild animals in the mountains, and wild animals are also the teacher. There is a turtle in the river, and the turtle is also the teacher. Only by observing things can we understand the principles. All things have their strengths. If we see something with our own eyes and do not know how to pursue its uses and subtleties, we are truly not as good as things. China is scientifically backward because those who study science do not regard all things as teachers.</p>
<p>If you don't believe me, look at the apple! Isn't it Newton's teacher? Look at the teapot! Isn't it Watt's teacher? Look at the insects and birds and beasts, which one is not Darwin's teacher?</p>
<p>The masses, heaven and earth are your schools, and all things are your teachers. As long as you ask about everything and pay attention to everything, you can be guaranteed to step into the treasure house of knowledge.</p>
<h3>Science Games (Continued)</h3>
<p>(3) Guessing Coins Across a Fist: Ask a child to take a few copper coins in his hand at will, without prior notice, and I can guess the number of copper coins he took. I myself take a known number of copper coins (let's say seventeen) and say to the child: "Your fist against my fist, make up ten coins, return your original amount, and I'll have seven copper coins left." After saying this, the two of us stretch out our palms and count, and it will be exactly as said, no matter how many the child takes. The reason is, suppose the number I take myself is 10 + a, and the number the child takes is b. Then the sum of the two numbers is 10 + a + b. After the two stretch out their palms, first "make up ten coins," that is, subtract ten from the sum, and then "return your original amount," that is, subtract b again, so the number "I have left" must be 10 + a + b - (10 + b) = a. In other words, if I have thirteen myself, I will have three left. If I have fourteen, I will have four left, and so on. This method is originally a very simple "algebra" subtraction! (4) Guessing Numbers in Separate Rooms: Ask a child to write any number (but it must be within 105) without telling anyone. In a separate room, first divide the original number by three, and only tell me the "remainder" without saying the "quotient." Then divide the original number by five, and tell me the remainder. Finally, divide it by seven and tell me the remainder. At this time, I can guess the "original number."</p>
<p>Method: Regard each remainder from dividing by three as seventy, each remainder from dividing by five as twenty-one, and each remainder from dividing by seven as fifteen. Add the three remainders together to get the original number. But if the sum is greater than 105, then you must subtract 105 from the sum to get the original number. For example, if the remainder from dividing by three is one, the remainder from dividing by five is one, and there is no remainder from dividing by seven, then the original number is 70 x 1 + 21 x 1 + 15 x 0 = 91. As another example, if the remainder from dividing by three is one, the remainder from dividing by five is two, and the remainder from dividing by seven is three, then the original number is 70 x 1 + 21 x 2 + 15 x 3 = 157. But this number is greater than 105, so the real original number is 157 - 105 = 52. The rest are similar. The reason is that this is derived from the "least common multiple" in arithmetic. Explaining it in detail would be very lengthy, and I am afraid that the children would get bored, so I will omit it for now. (End)</p>
<p>Street Sociology</p>
<h3>Fortunately, There Are Non-Profit Electrical Advertisements on Nanjing Road</h3>
<p>The electrical advertisements on Nanjing Road, red, green, big, small, Chinese, Western, flickering on and off, are colorful every night, illuminating the street like daytime. However, these advertisements are all flashing, tempting people's eyes. Every word is using great attraction, trying to grab the heart of every passerby. "Pay attention to me, I will supply your needs, I will satisfy you." Every advertisement, every word, seems to be sending out such sweet and moving shouts. Its purpose is entirely for profit, with almost no exceptions.</p>
<p>However, there is an exception here. On the side of the Shuanglong Tea Shop, there is a vertical red electrical advertisement with six large characters. However, it is not for profit. The six large characters are "Namo Amitabha Buddha".</p>
<p>Not for profit, then what is it for? This is a mystery. Or, some people say it is for "saving the world" and for "awakening the world." It is a true reflection of the "compassionate heart" of "my Buddha." Or, some people think it is a kind of "decoration," which is precisely what shows the mottled and bizarre nature of Nanjing Road.</p>
<p>When a worldly-wise, pot-bellied merchant, or an illiterate commoner's gaze, passes by this advertisement, what effect will "Namo Amitabha Buddha" have on him? I think only "Namo Amitabha Buddha" knows.</p>
<p>From All Directions</p>
<h3>American Kerosene King Rockefeller Boze</h3>
<p>"The most important thing for young people who are taking the first step in life is to have credibility, because this is what creates their personality."</p>
<p>American kerosene king Rockefeller often said this. The Anglo-American confrontation is by no means just a naval competition, but a fierce kerosene war. We see it as almost a total mobilization of the British Empire against a Rockefeller.</p>
<p>The reason why he became the current kerosene king is because the banks all believed in his personal character and credibility and lent him 4,000 yuan to start his business. He often said, "I, Rockefeller, will not be wrong. Credit is my entire fortune." Starting with a monthly income of only five or ten yuan, he never said the word "I." He said, "I am just one of us." Therefore, he who often said "we" could become the authority of modern America, precisely because he was fully qualified.</p>
<p>Shanghai Stories</p>
<h3>Shanghai Stories (3)</h3>
<p>Ancient Sites</p>
<p>Shanghai's history is short. From a historical perspective, it certainly can't compare to other metropolises. Famous historical sites are as rare as morning stars. The more important ones are Jing'an Temple, Xujiahui, and Longhua. These three places can be considered the foremost scenic spots in Shanghai. Beside the ancient Jing'an Temple is an ancient well, which was known in ancient times as one of China's six great holy springs. Every spring, on the birthday of Sakyamuni Buddha, a temple fair is held. The four sides of Jing'an Temple form an extremely lively market. Merchants gather, and men and women are as numerous as clouds. The incense in the temple is blinding, and people rub shoulders on the road. Goods are displayed, especially bamboo wares.</p>
<p>Xujiahui is the former residence of Xu Guangqi, a great scholar of the late Ming Dynasty. Guangqi was born in the forty-first year of Jiajing (1562 AD). He was one of the first Chinese scholar-officials to join the Christian church. He befriended the Westerner Matteo Ricci and learned astronomy, arithmetic, and other sciences from him. Therefore, Guangqi was largely responsible for introducing Western science to China. In the southwest corner of the Xujiahui Cathedral is Guangqi's tomb.</p>
<p>Longhua Town has the Longhua Pagoda, a relic of the Han Dynasty. Some say it is a relic of the Tang Dynasty. In the third month of the lunar calendar, the peach blossoms bloom, splendid and colorful for ten miles, adding to the many scenic spots. Men and women tourists are continuously on the road.</p>
<p>Prelude to Opening the Port</p>
<p>In the twentieth year of Qianlong, after the British had conquered India, Biggs of the East India Company had already suggested opening Shanghai to trade. In the eleventh year of Daoguang (1832 AD), the East India Company dispatched the merchant ship Amherst from Macau, with Lyndsay (Mr. Hngh Hamilton Lindsay) as the leader of the commercial committee. Via Xiamen, Fuzhou, and Ningbo, they requested trade, but were refused by all the local authorities. They then went to Shanghai. The Shanghai authorities had known about this and initially wanted to refuse the Amherst merchant ship entry into the port. However, Lindsay managed to find ways, and met with the Shanghai Daotai at the Tianhou Temple. Although he did not receive preferential treatment, he was finally able to state his intentions. The Shanghai Daotai informed him that Guangzhou was the only port open for trade, and that Shanghai could not allow them to stay for long and should leave immediately. Lindsay, unable to get what he wanted, led the ship to Korea. This episode can be considered the prelude to Shanghai opening as a port.</p>

<h3>A Brief History of the Actors' Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Actors' United Association is a professional organization formed by all the actors in Shanghai. It was established in the first year of the Republic of China. The purpose of the association is to connect colleagues' feelings, strive for the dignity of actors, and protect the professional status of actors. At the beginning of its establishment, it received support from all walks of life. At that time, in view of the large number of actors' children who were out of school, Zhenling School was established. Furthermore, because actors are also part of the nation, they should have the responsibility to defend the country, so the Actors' Business Corps was founded. During the Xinhai Revolution, they followed the martyr Chen Qimei in attacking and capturing the Manufacturing Bureau, maintaining local security. Their work was very diligent. During the Guichou Revolution, the Actors' Association was resented by the Yuan government for supporting the revolution and was illegally dissolved. The school was also abolished, and the association's address was occupied by military police. In the ninth year of the Republic of China, after the association and the authorities fought hard, the association's premises were finally recovered. The Actors' Association was then revived. The school was also restored. In the eighteenth year, the president system was changed to a committee system. All association affairs were handled by the executive and supervisory committee members. The association's affairs became increasingly complex, and the financial needs also increased day by day.</p>
<h3>The Economic Situation of the Actors' Association</h3>
<p>The members of the various committees of the Actors' Association are purely volunteers and never receive any subsidies from the association. This is unique to any public organization. The main expenses of the association include the following:</p>
<p>Zhenling Primary School ...... Tuition is completely free for children of colleagues, and books and supplies are also provided. Poor children from outside the industry can also receive free education if introduced by a member. There are currently more than 200 students. Due to the limited school site, students who have registered beyond the quota cannot be accepted, which is a great pity.</p>
<p>Liyuan Cemetery ...... The old cemetery was located on Kangdi Road in the French Concession. Recently, because the surrounding area has become more prosperous, it is not suitable for burial. It has been moved to the Zhenru Township Cemetery. It has more than ten acres of burial land. All deceased colleagues and their families can be buried here without charge.</p>
<p>Nursing Home ...... Acting is a labor-intensive profession. It is not like other professions where experience and qualifications can be relied upon. Therefore, colleagues who are old and weak cannot work. Those who have no children to support them and who have no ability to support themselves, the association has set up a nursing home to take care of them until they die. The home is located in Zhenru Township. Food, clothing, and shelter are all provided by the association.</p>
<p>Changsheng Society ...... When members of the association or their family members die, and they are too poor to afford a coffin, the Changsheng Society attached to the association provides a coffin. All coffins and shrouds are provided by the association free of charge.</p>
<p>Widows' Allowance ...... After a member dies, leaving behind a widow and orphans who have no way to live, the association provides a monthly food allowance at its discretion.</p>
<p>Unemployment Relief ...... During the hot summer and cold winter, the association provides subsidies to poor comrades after investigation, to help them make a living.</p>
<p>Travel Assistance ...... Most of the colleagues in our industry are from out of town. Occasionally, they are in trouble in this city or stranded in a foreign country. Once a colleague reports it, the association provides travel assistance at its discretion to help them return home.</p>
<p>The above are just the major items. Other expenses such as the salaries of hired employees, the expenses of the Liyuan Public Newspaper, and all miscellaneous and temporary expenses of the association are not included.</p>
<p>The expenses of the Actors' Association are huge, but the income and funding come only from two items: members' income donations and Changsheng Society donations. Income donations mean that all members must pay 5% of their monthly salary to the Actors' Association, called the 5% donation. Changsheng Society donations do not specify an amount, and their use is limited to providing coffins and shrouds. Therefore, the association's income and funding is only the 5% donation. With limited income to cover dozens of times the expenses, the association's finances are often stretched, and it has to rely on external assistance.</p>
<h3>Fundraising by Performing Drama</h3>
<p>The members of the Actors' Association are all working class people who rely on their skills to make a living. If they want to raise funds, there is no other way than to gather all the members to perform dramas together. This is why the association has held large-scale performances in the past. The association has always received support from society, and the Actors' Association's performances are enough to attract audiences. Whenever there are public welfare and charitable events in the local area, there are always performances to raise funds. Each time, the funds raised are considerable. Now, the association is performing for its own fundraising, and it has to rely on the support of philanthropists from all walks of life. In the past, the association did not issue tickets in advance for its performances. Only by using the strength of all the members to perform good plays that connoisseurs have never seen before, can we convey social sympathy and sincerely invite ladies and gentlemen to come. After they come, we must make everyone happy, so that everyone can not only enjoy the pleasure of listening and watching, but also reap the practical benefits of doing good deeds. Therefore, every performance is full of distinguished guests and praised as a grand event in the Liyuan (theater) world. Those who love to talk about the anecdotes of the Liyuan world cannot help but participate in the fundraising performances of the Actors' Association.</p>
<h3>The Special Features of the 22nd Grand Performance</h3>
<p>The Actors' Association's previous performances were mostly from within the industry. This time, however, Mrs. Du, a famous lady from Shanghai, has been specially invited to join. This shows that her artistic skills are so exquisite that they are admired by all members of our industry. Mrs. Du is not one to easily show her face. This time, because it concerns the public welfare of the acting world, she finally agreed to come on stage after repeated requests from the association. She will perform her masterpiece, the complete play "Crying at the Ancestral Temple." In order to make this play as perfect as possible, the association has specially invited all the famous actors to play supporting roles. This is an unprecedented initiative and a beautiful story in the Liyuan world. This is an unprecedented feature in the Actors' Association's performances. The opportunity will not come again. It is hoped that all lovers of opera will not miss it. As for the highlights of "Crying at the Ancestral Temple," more details will be announced tomorrow.</p>
