<h3>中國企業之危機　　梓·</h3>
<p>中國人方以經濟絶交應付日本之武力侵略而日本人竟準備足以掃蕩</p>
<p>中國企業之對策。此吾人所應嚴重注意而更謀所以應付者也。日本大阪市公所産業部調查課出版之［東洋貿易研究］月刋。於七月號中。載有論述東北上海兩事變與日本對華貿易之文。字其最後一段揭出［　以非日爲前提之貿易對策］者。茲譯其要點。並加以解釋如左。原文謂［論及以排日爲前提之對策。似應先着眼於對華企業之進行過去對華投資額。約計四億元。其中紡績業占二億元餘爲雜種工業。而此等各種企業之營業實績。决難爲成績優良。此固因中國政府之露骨排外政策而製品受差别待遇。及因人種偏見而罷工風潮迭起之故。然一方面。在華企業製品之銷路僅限於中國國内與中國製品常立於競爭之地位。且輪入品亦同樣受排日之餘波亦。應加以考慮者也。又最迟乘銀價低落而進行之邦人企業頗多。類皆歸於失敗者。除前述这外面的障碍以外。又應歸過於資本額太少。故今後欲爲新對華企業。必須以相當之資本。同時藉工塲規模之擴大及製品之改良。潮次將銷路擴至海外市塲以確立廣泛之營業政策。實最爲得計。且亦［求免於排貨影響之方法也。］</p>
<p>此一段文字。雖不似日本軍閥言詞之咄咄逼人。　似日本政治家論調之鋒芒四射。然按礤實際。新的經濟侵略政策之實現。足以掃萬中國企業。使淪於萬刧不復之境。較之軍閥政治家之所企圖其隐　有過之無不及也。彼所謂以相當大資本擴展在華企業者。易商品輪出爲資本輪出。易商貨競爭爲工業競爭實爲可制中國企業之死命之惡策。中國空有富足之原料。與多數工資低廉之勞工。而資本使用與工業按術。均甚幼稚一旦日本以相當犬資本及其工業技術猛力侵入。國内企業界。萬難與之抗衡。不能與之抗衡。惟有相率被迫銷滅。過去中國紗廠之爲日人所　谷。及經濟史上小工業之受迫於大工業而失敗。前車覆轍。歷歷可鑑。此吾人　　注意者一也。彼所謂以在華企業製品擴展銷路於海外市塲者。欲盡收經濟學上直接投資之利益。控制中國之企業界。使無蘇生之望。使日人此項企圖而得達到。則今後中國之國際貿易。入超固有害。即有出超之一日。其利亦將盡爲日人所獲。而中國低廉之工資與富足之原料。不過供日人在華企業之利用耳。吾人已見日人在華紗廠之壓迫中國棉紗市塲。日人又準備以其在中國之製品更有所企圖。此不僅中國企業界之危機。中國人之服用物資。將見盡爲日人貿易所操縱。而無自主之餘地此吾人所應注意者又一也。</p>
<p>吾幼稚之企業界於日人之所謂貿易對策。將以何種對策應付之乎。此實一較抵貨問題更爲重要之問題也。</p>

<h3>熱湯</h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>大熱天氣，街頭巷尾正大做春冰淇淋酸梅湯這一類冷的飲料的生涯，但是，報紙上面，卻大書特書着熱湯兩個字。</p>
<p>熱湯，便是熱河湯玉麟的省稱。自從東北不抵抗，失卻了許多錦繡江山，宛比在民衆頭上淋了一杓冷水，敎他們整個的身體，都冷了半截！現在熱湯是主張抵抗的了，宛比給那冷了半截的民衆喝了一杯滾盪的薑汁，使他們熱騰騰地做那抗敵的工作！熱湯！熱湯！這才是名副其實的熱湯！</p>
<p>有人懷疑熱湯，說他從前的態度，不大鮮明，好像和那舶來品的中將湯，混合在一起，成了一碗和合湯了。但是，疾風知勁草，板蕩識忠臣，熱河吃緊的當兒，熱湯發表了一篇湯誓大文章，果能心口如一，熱河地方，便不難固若金湯了。熱湯！熱湯！我把你當做四萬萬人的續命湯！末了，頌不忘規，贈給你一首湯之盤銘··</p>
<p>熱湯·毋忘！</p>
<p>永遠不要改變你的熱湯！</p>
<p>休得熱氣化爲冷氣，</p>
<p>變做了冷的飲料冰淇淋，和酸梅湯！</p>
<p>冷了你的湯，</p>
<p>便是冷了四萬萬人的血，冷了四萬萬人的心腸！</p>
<p>熱湯毋忘！</p>
<h3>嚴典史</h3>
<p>— 王翼吾</p>
<p>我炎黄貴胄並非全是貪生怕死，不愛國，無氣節者，歷史上亡於元，亡於淸的時候，孤軍守土，衛國勤王之輩，正不知凡幾。只可惜地位崇高，握有兵權的大人物，大都貪生怕死，不愛國，無氣節而已！大人物阿附求生，祇賸在下位，無實力的人，矢志不屈，自然無濟於事··至多不過撑持幾十天，使這一方稍後些時易色··反苦了人民，大大地流一塲血··如明末福王偏安金陵時，權奸用事，不知以宗社爲重，雖有史閣部，亦不能隻手回天！否則晋元宋高，猶能延續統緖，繩引百載，難道福王就不能嗎？那時在金陵的一班居高位者，有氣節的實在不多！獨江陰典史嚴某，矢忠明室，誓不降胡，號召得三千人，同心拒守。初因淸軍不甚重視，祇派少數軍隊來攻，被嚴擊退。後來淸軍調集大部，嚴不能敵，始據城固守。淸軍圍攻甚急。嚴典史困於城内，旣無糧，又無援，勉守到七十日，終於被淸軍攻陷，嚴與三千人皆以身殉！並在殉難前自題一聯道；（七十日帶髪効忠；表太祖十六朝人物；三千人同心赴義，存大明一百里江山！）假使金陵小朝廷也能同心赴義，之死靡他，則淸軍又何足畏呢？現在的東北三省，正有同槪！那負有守土之責，帶甲數十萬的長官，居然不抵抗，義勇軍反起仆不已，到處有嚴典史其人，幹着（存大明一百里江山）的工作。但是結果又誰不與嚴典史遭同樣運命，徒然流一塲血！如果負責的長官在此際翻然覺悟，肯用武力收回東三省，則這些嚴典史們便大有效用，不會徒然流血了。然而負責的長官又不肯這樣做，嚴典史們想（存大明一百里江山，）又如何存得住？可是話雖如此，在上者儘管不抵抗，嚴典史們也不可不有，到底充分地表現了炎黄貴胄非全是貪生怕死，不愛國，無氣節呢！</p>

<p>— 周才良</p>
<p>友人胡君。負笈美國有年。邇以學成</p>
<p>爲予述最近蘇俄留美學生之生活甚趣。予以其語足供我國當局之借鑑。爰記之如下。</p>
<p>震驚世界之蘇俄五年計劃。初步已告成功。良以其名雖復興經濟。實則爲化學戰爭之預備最近遠東風雲。日趨緊急。而彼邦之工業生産。亦復猛進。上月間該國政府有鑒於工科人才之供不應求。乃選派少壯學生凡八十餘人。保送入美國麻省理工大學肄業。指定專習工藝。惟美政府以突來大批赤色分子。心頗惴惴。而爲顧全邦交計實難婉拒。無已。乃劃定該校之一部分校舍。撥作若輩棲息之所。舉凡誦讀實習游戲食宿等事。均不得越雷池一步。且命主事者禁與美籍學生交接。犯須重懲。其防範赤化之嚴密。用心可謂至苦。而蘇俄學生。則行若無事。仍各致力於工業上之研究。囚首垢面。旦夕不輟。即衣食服用。亦至樸陋。故我國留美同學談及此事。幾莫不引爲異事云。</p>
<h3>錢話</h3>
<p>— 覺民</p>
<p>日來爲錢魔所困。偶憶錢話數則。錄供談助。亦聊以自箴箴人云爾。昔有募捐者。往謁英之巨商墨萊約翰。時墨氏方高燃二燭以作書。見客入。亟熄其一。募捐者以爲此行無所得矣。乃陳詞旣竟。墨氏慨捐百金。異之。因謂氏曰。君之所爲。殊出余輩之望外。敢問其故。氏曰。作書固需二燭。談話則得一已足。。此所以余有餘資捐作慈善事業也。</p>
<p>美國某富翁嘗述已之閱歷云。余商業得手之初。余妻建議置一沙發於客室。孰知一念之錯。竟耗金三萬。蓋室中旣陳一富麗之沙發。則覺其他之椅凳皆不相稱。不得不易新者。繼之。一切櫉檯桌几地氈。遂又不得不求一一與之相稱。迨器具皆新。則又覺居室狹而陋。必更造之而後可。綜計先後所費。達三萬金。然而余困矣。</p>
<p>拿破倫生平治事最勤。每日黎明即起。一日。進事務室。聞一少年書記之歌聲。異其早。因讚其勤。並詢以薪金若干。對曰。年一千二百金。拿曰。以子之齡。而得此厚俸。無怪子之謳歌矣。曰噫。理固當然。惜臣未之能也。臣家有老父弱妹。皆頼臣以生。且被債主又常來相難。故臣頗戚戚焉。拿頓悟少年之早起者。乃竟夕不得安眠。而以公事解悶。即口中謳歌。亦以此也。憫之。賜二千金。并警以倘再舉一債。立黜不貸。</p>
<h3>値得介紹之國貸工廠（一七）</h3>

<h3>澹園遣暑記</h3>
<p>— 沈汝元</p>
<p>永嘉昔有山水窟之目。雁蕩跨峙其間。奇秀爲東南名勝之冠。凡曾游其境者莫不嘖嘖稱之。元耳熟焉。惜未能身歷爲憾。今春倭宼淞滬。馬師孟容挈眷還永暫避。元以困居滬寓爲苦。即於夏初赴永拜謁。藉遂游覽之願。時孟師居城北之澹園。園爲其尊人菊湄太老師所新葺。太老師從政歸來。即頣養園林。以琴書自娱。園中雜植嘉木奇卉。中多常靑樹。春夏敷榮。而秋冬亦不凋落。寓繁華澹泊之中。意至善也。園中聽松閣闢爲三室。中爲太老師琴室。懸古琴數張。左爲孟師書室。壁間懸古今名家書畫十數幅。右爲藏書室。庋藏圖藉額富。閣臨江負郭。孤嶼帶其前。郭山枕其右。風景幽絶。旁鑿小池。中蓄緋鯉。環植垂柳。時聞鳥聲。即火傘當空而淸風拂拂。閣中幾無暑氣。太老師喜焚香靜坐。著書調琴以消永畫。年來著有春暉堂琴譜琴銘集琴學叢談歷代詠琴詩選都數十卷。孟師尤勤勉。每晨讀書作畫吟詩以自課。午後則敎授元輩。循循不倦。孟師於畫理畫法造詣至邃。能深入淺出。發前人之所未發。學者一經指導。便覺精進無量。孟師課餘讀罷。輒潛心著作。擬編著畫理畫法畫譜若干種付印。以公同好。（聞花鳥譜書畫金石集已再版數次。新著花鳥草蟲譜亦將付印）蓋馬氏三百餘年來。以琴書詩畫金石世其家。自蔚霞解元。香霞拔萃。蘭生明經。菊湄文學。皆有聲藝苑。至孟師公愚師叔而益光大。淵源家學。蔚爲宗風焉。孟師醇篤冲和。而每爲公正發憤。此次暴日侵　　　　凌。輒託詩歌以寄意。元每欲作抗日文字或圖畫。輒請孟師指示。師不壓詳爲講劃。益嘆其憫時愛國之切矣孟師現應中華學藝社之召。與黄賓虹劉海粟王濟遠馬公愚諸公共籌美術展覽會事。行將返滬。元恐不克久留。爰筆之以紀鴻爪。</p>

<h3>古廟敲鐘錄　（六十五）</h3>
<p>— 不除庭草齊夫</p>
<p>六十二</p>
<p>我說··（工學團可以不翼而飛，我有當的信心。但是飛進傳統的學校裏去，難免有人要把牠捉起來，關進籠裏去，或者存心不良投牠一彈，</p>
<p>送他老命，也未可知。）朱先生說··（這個我們當然是要顧慮到。你所說的這些不幸的事，有時是會發。現但是我們决不可因爲或者要發現的事而心灰意懶。這工學團的傳佈大槪不出兩個方式··一是自然的傳佈·，二是强制的傳怖。自然的傳佈是靠個人態度的改變。如果現在有人請你去辦一個學校，或是開一個工廠，或是管一個監牢，或是帶一支軍隊，你想預備怎樣去幹？）我說··（我無疑的要把牠辦成一個工學團。）（你在一個月前可有這個信念？））（没有。）（那末你的個人的態度的改變只是一個月來的功效。你旣能在一個月内改變了你的態度，别的人有些是和你變得一樣的快，我的年紀比你大些，變化也就來得慢些，可是我的敎育上的主張的改變也不過是三五年的事。人是會變的。傳統的敎師會變成革命的敎師。你不要以爲你是一個維新的分子就以爲别人都是守舊的分子。你更不可以爲一個人現在守舊便永遠守舊。誰願走死路？走死路的人不外兩種··一是如同老鼠鑽進牛角筒，不知道自已走的路是死路·，二是如同海船上失火急得跳下水去，以爲燒死比溺死更可怕。如果你眞能指示出牛角筒是死路，眞能　下一個救命圈，誰願固執已見，自尋死路？假使我們在行動上，事實上，證明了工學團是中華民族之救命圈，傳統學校是中華民族的死路，誰還願去辦傳統學校？誰不願把傳統學校做有意義的工學團？一個學校的師生有此覺悟便是一個工學團成功·，一個工廠的職員工人有此覺悟又是一個工學團成功·，一個監獄的典獄官犯人有此覺悟又是一個工學團成功·，一個軍隊的帶兵官兵丁有此覺悟又是一個工學團成功。這事是簡之至，易之至。只要每一集團的人·肯做工，肯長進，不肯把自已的脚踏在别人的頭上也不肯讓别人的脚踏自已的頭上，就得了，這工學團便自然而然的成功了。</p>

<h3>糧食　米市漲而復跌</h3>
<p>滬南　昨日天氣轉晴到船二三十號、城鄕銷塲不振、市面緊而復跌、立秋節將近、各貨行情步跌二角光景、厚粳及早晚稻開盤降低一二角、洋杜尖到銷二平、上落有限、糯米到頭雖少、然去化更呆、形勢下游、兼之浦江存積尙有、洋米又復平落、寗胃全無、形勢難以向上</p>
<p>新閘昨日西路來源二十餘號、走銷初滯後爽常錫北粳在早晨極呆、價續軟化、店方進意轉淡、頂定次小三角、早薄稻亦跟小角許、變陰元貨稀價漲角許、新粳裝到略少、人心不振、開盤站定、全日斛脚約二千石之譜、</p>
<h3>津帮辦裝西貢米</h3>
<p>寗紹帮問津小絞</p>
<p>昨洋米市况、有天津與寗紹帮之辦裝、市形甚佳統市開出各米一萬餘包天津帮辦去一號西貢三千包寗紹帮辦去陳新小絞五千包本街内地各户亦稍問津、惟貨主均有售意、囤户以天熱不欲久貯故消化雖佳、行情未克步漲、祇覺市而活絡行情可以站住倘再有大批去化、市價方可轉機全日開出一號西貢三千包、價十元零二角半至十元零一角、小絞米七千包新貨九元半至九元三角七分陳小絞九元一角至九元價格比前日小去一角、但貨品稍次、市况與前日相似云、</p>
<h3>標粉呈初漲繼跌象</h3>
<p>昨粉市上午開盤後各月份市面、呈初漲繼跌之象以洋麥報價、回漲五角及二三角左右、故初盤時人心頗昻、近遠期較前日回好一分外、惟自二盤後、則市氣又急轉直下、聞澳麥確成交一船、由祥茂經手、連費四兩、故阜豐抛售甚暢、福新亦繼出不少福州帮之多頭、亦大票回出因此市氣大虛幾有重進九錢一　之勢觀後步恐非實銷轉暢、又難樂觀矣、結果本月份較前日小一分二厘半、九月份小二分、十月份小一分二厘半十一月份小一分、十二月份小五厘、一月份好二厘半云、</p>
<h3>期麥買户多</h3>
<p>昨期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份市面、又呈堅穏之象、因洋麥報價、復漲二三角及五角左右、業外人心、自然堅定而最大原因、則以内地麥價自標準飛漲之後已引起人心之深切注意故步步追踪、開價黱貴故如高郵報價、合申已到六錢、無錫開至六元三角、因此買户仍暢、價難鬆落也、結果八月份較前日漲三分、九月份漲三分十·十一月份漲二分、十二月份漲三分現麥因到銷均寂、市無做開云、</p>
<h3>糖市粗砂白市形頗俏</h3>
<p>昨日糖市公會市場劃盤、交易尙盛、荷糖二十四號粗砂白成交價爲十四兩六錢半、十八號中砂白十四兩、八號荷赤十兩零四錢、十四號生砂赤十二兩七錢、市且見緊、趨勢均皆穏秀、太古糖進出轉寥十六兩四錢、出户殊稀、ＨＸ嘜十五兩三錢、ＨＭ嘜十四兩八錢略有成交、市形平穏號盤有華新號售開現貨高貨粗砂白一千三百十二袋價元十四兩六錢半、行方進胃殊濃、故瞬卽售通市象頗覺俏秀云、</p>
<h3>絲茶</h3>
<p>歐美華絲電報續有發出</p>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊絲市、仍乏進展之趨勢、海外期現絲電報昨仍未見轉滬、而信孚達昌等昨均有廠乾經電報發出、華洋雙方均俟電轉進行、昨祇連納進中身Ｂ級十三至十八條份現貨白廠經十五包、價扯四百九十兩、係乘機補充缺貨、並非實銷發動云、</p>
<h3>路莊珍眉交易旺盛</h3>
<p>昨本埠洋莊茶市、來路莊之珍眉綠茶、英莊恊和怡和錦隆天裕等行、搜買仍不遺餘力、全市成交各路綠茶共計三千六百餘箱、市面續趨活潑、其中遂安　坪開化等路貨、市盤又漲三四兩、其餘亦一致趨硬、惟祁寗紅茶、日來英商行家、完全無人問及、俄莊亦抱抑價態度、去路最爲呆滯云、</p>
<h3>疋頭　夏令呢絨尾銷跌價</h3>
<p>法蘭　·羽紗呢·巴勒呢·眫别取·白嗶嘰·白直貢·雙紗膠布·珠羅紗·未也勅等夏令需銷之貨、現已成尾銷之聲、執貨者俱願讓價、以冀脫手、但買方仍少再進夏貨之意、以致市盤下跌、昨、永樂黄斜紋　批每碼祇喊售四錢半、雙紗膠布爲三錢一分半、好時·漢平白直貢·俱减至三兩六錢、普通老式絲光條子羽紗呢一律削至一兩五六錢、巴勒呢眫别取較旬日前跌賤一二錢不等、未也勅珠羅紗每碼平均便宜三五分、</p>
<h3>五金英白鐡漲價後成交不多</h3>
<p>英白鐡以成本之浩大底貨之薄弱、早有漲價之可能、惟洋行現貨紛紛脫手出售、致標準有外强中乾之象、最近問洋行現貨被金融富裕之號家多已收囤、是以市象隨之益挺、但實交方面新近無甚進展、蓋估盤突高、買户反不敢下手、故數日來無大宗開出雖市上微有點綴、不過係廠家及建築帮之零星生意耳其價現市四十八張價十一兩三十八張十一兩五錢、三十三張十一兩、二十五張價十兩零七錢半、二十一張十兩零五錢、六十張價十一兩五錢、聞一查各同業之淮本、尙無利可圖則後市到貨不多、人心鞏固、行情一節大有繼續看好之可能云、</p>

<p>十六年又嫁葉理紹</p>
<p>兒子不知誰爲生父</p>
<p>葉理紹控其以子營利</p>
<p>在法租界天主堂街晉成錢莊　爲經理之胡秉衡、近被曾在持志大學肄業之嘉興人徐曁平以詐婚誘姦遺棄等罪、控於特區第一法院、緣胡與徐於民十五年相識後、卽結爲夫婦、生有二子二女近因胡不願贍養　以致引起訟事、案經吳廷琪推事開庭審問、以胡徐旣係正式配耦、按夫婦無自訴之權、故當將訴訟駁斥、其後徐曁平奉判不服、復向該院民庭提起確認身份之訴、緣當時胡謂與徐係於民十五年間相識、初則幽叙、繼則同居、實非正式配耦　並因徐曾與</p>
<p>楓涇人葉理紹　於民十六年結</p>
<p>婚　而於民二十年間離婚、其長子端生、適在其時産生、故該孩爲胡所生、抑爲葉所生、成爲問題、胡秉衡欲明瞭案情起見、故於上月二十八日庭訊之時　邀葉到滬出庭作證、其時葉卽以證人地位、提出與徐離婚時所訂之合同　證明端生確是親生、而徐則否認、當因胡徐訟案一時不能審結、故庭諭改期再審　詎退庭之後、葉理紹忽將</p>

<p>强暴行爲傷害　使自訴人無力</p>
<p>抵抗、爲此依刑法三一九條之規定、請求法辦、並檢騐被告吸食鴉片嗜好、一併法辦云云、葉理紹亦委費國禧律師具狀訴徐曁平妨害婚姻、故意詐財、藏匿嫡子、意圖營利、並附帶民訴、請求交還嫡子、其狀謂竊自訴人於民國十四年間、在上海浦東中學校讀書、與同學徐仁基（卽被告之胞兄）頗稱莫逆、並由徐仁基介紹被告相識爲友因此愛情日深、發生戀愛、民國十六年、廢曆正月、在上海西門保産醫院生一男孩、遂由王琴秋居間說合、卽於同年廢歷三月二十日、在杭州</p>

<p>與胡秉結婚　　紅燭高燒、行正式婚禮、與胡同居已有七年之久、迄今計生二子二女、現因被胡遺棄、故向鈞院控告、並附帶民訴洋五萬元（刑事二十年地字四九零號）自訴、經鈞院駁斥、而被告復向鈞院民庭提起確認妻之身份、並賠償損害洋十萬元之訴、（民事二十年地字一一四三號）均有案可稽、查被告旣在民國十五年三月二十八日與胡秉衡在上海遠東飯店結婚、何以又至民國十六年廢歷三月二十日、在杭州滄洲飯店與自訴人結婚、被告與</p>
<p>二人以上結婚　顯係故意用詐</p>
<p>術騙婚、將自訴人禮物銀騙去、以圖得不法之所有、雖被告與自訴人於民國二十年一月二十二日脫離夫婦關係、而被告仍要求贍養費洋一</p>
<p>千元、顯見被告係慣用詐婚騙術、脅迫男子、訂立非法契約、以爲賠償損失及贍養費之地步又被告以自訴人之子、向人要索鉅欵、故其臅犯刑章、事實昭然、查被告與自訴人離異合同第二條、載明小兒端生、果自訴人扶養、經仲義（卽被告原名現改曁平）指定地點、派人監護、自簽押日起、端生五歲以前、自訴人給付生活費每月三十元、自五歲至十三歲、每月二十元、十三歲至十六歲、給付中學相當費用、第三條理紹（卽自訴人）自簽押起十天内、給付端生乳母工資洋二百元、第四條、理紹簽押日起二十天内、給付仲羲贍養費洋一千元、第六條、端生至十六歲以後、歸理紹承養、與仲羲無涉、第七條、任何一方違背本合同上述條件者、願賠償違約金洋一萬元、以上合同條件、明明載明端生係自訴人之嫡子、今被告在民庭否認</p>
<p>端生係葉所生　堅稱係胡秉衡</p>
<p>生的、並謂與自訴人結婚、均係胡秉主使云云、被告言詞自相矛盾、實係誣說、被告一婦竟有二夫、一子復有二父、婚姻等於兒戱、拆白是其慣技、東食西宿、暮楚朝秦、男子供其而首、子女居爲奇貨、似此覆雨翻雲、　張爲幻、無非到處敲詐、冀得不法利益、又被告將自訴人之嫡子端生向胡秉衡敲詐、意圖營利、並脫離自訴人享有之親權、核其所爲、實已觸犯刑法云云、並對於徐曁平妨害生命之訴、提起反訴其訴狀上節、與自訴狀同、後節稱今徐曁平否認端生係理紹所生、將來焉能向其索回、顯見徐</p>
<p>以結婚爲騙術　藏匿端生以營</p>
<p>利、實有敲詐錢財拐逃嫡子之情、故於七月二十八日退庭後、卽將其送鈞院刑庭懸辦、奉承審推事傅琳審理、徐供稱並無傷害、故卽論令退去、可知理紹並無强暴脅迫行爲、祇有同至刑庭審理之事實、故其所控毫無理由、今葉旣無脅迫行兇行爲、則徐故意使理紹受刑事處分、實搆成一八零條一項之罪、故根據刑法三五六條、提起誣告之訴、當因</p>
<p>徐曁平未到庭　向葉理紹亦因</p>
<p>其兄亡故、返楓涇奔喪、均未到案、故無從審理、庭諭收期再審、</p>

<h3>大會第六日　競技之預評</h3>
<p>興味集中四百米與標槍</p>
<p>（電通三日洛由磯電）亞林匹克大會、四日爲開會以來之第六日、緊張之狀、益有豋峯造極之勢、除舉行標槍、三級跳、千五百米等决賽外、並舉行四百米預賽複賽、</p>
<p>爭四百米冠軍者　當爲伊斯德曼（美）蘭布林（英）蘭爾（加）沙里拉斯（智利）等數人而已、此外劉長春（中華）、西貞一（日）、加爾利尼（意）、愛理古遜（瑞典）、瑪爾丹（瑞西）、約哈勒生（諾威）、密資勒爾（德）、中島亥太郎（日）、均有入選希望、四百米之亞林匹克記錄、亞姆斯丹大會時、美國已布齊、曾作成四十七秒記錄、然有世界記錄四六秒二之美國伊斯德曼選手、此次　料其必更成新記錄、</p>
<p>三級跳　前次得居第一有世界公認記錄之織田幹雄（日）春來脚部負傷、迄未全愈、已無當時（前次奪錦標時）意氣、恐須落至二等以下、且各國選手尤以華塞理（意）、皮達斯（荷）、斯恩生（瑞典）、克列（美）、亞爾維廉（芬）、霍克蘭德（諾威）、均有相當之進步、亦可望作成新記錄云、</p>
<p>標槍　瑞典芬蘭、有平分天下之勢、瑞典之盧特谷尼選手、於前次大會、曾作成世界記錄、今年則以芬蘭之亞爾成廉、爲冠軍候補者、日本有住吉耕作及長尾三郎兩選手出場、而以住吉可望人選、</p>

<p>言</p>
<h3>只可做不可說</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>昨天做［只可做不可說］的談言，是答復幾位讀者的質問，今天也是這個題，不過性質不同，就從［只可做不可說］的原理原則而言，並無連續性也。</p>
<p>［只可做不可說］，本來有兩種意義，　若以惡的方面言，這原是不行的，若以善的方面言，［只可做不可說］，原是最有價値的舉動，最有效能的辦法，一聲不響，努力做去，自會有很大的成績可覩。</p>
<p>獨惜我國人的做事，往往［未撒屎先呼狗］，法螺吹在前頭，而結果一些没有成效，倘能改變方面針，用［只可做不可說］的方法，脚踏實地努力做去，一定像藥房裏的百靈機，有意想不到的效力呢。</p>
<p>尤其是愛國集團組織的愛國行動，更要息心靜氣，次第去做，如關外之馬占山義勇軍等等，他們何嘗先吹法螺，而至今猶堅持於白山黑水問，亦無非是［祇可做不可說］之偉大成績。</p>

<h3>古意四章</h3>
<p>— 白蕉</p>
<p>丈夫云有淚，　不洒兒女私，酒人多伊鬱，達觀徒有詩，愁來如驟雨，歌哭不相宜，天涯共此月，悠悠我所思，　江水深盟在，一劍不斷絲，夢中綢繆語，千里不相知，誰言同相夢，夢亦有參差，吁嗟同心人，長别安可支，不如春來絮，因風任所之。</p>
<p>································</p>
<p>宿昔相見日，常恐别離時，别離訽可念，觸處成相思，握手期偕老，出涕不自知，薄言以相慰，相慰轉相悲，父母終我愛，庶幾念兒痴。</p>
<p>································</p>
<p>黑風來北方，分飛比翼鳥，遂使一參商，文采俱相杳，偶亦有傳言，消息難分曉，畫中伊何人，我心乃有標，市聲何喧喧，我心何悄悄，悄悄安足云，哀情不可了，皎皎明月光，照我孤影山。</p>
<p>································</p>
<p>女也心無他，士也行無貳，東門女如花，一月三過視，遺我以繡羅，慰我以素字豈不念慇懃，言亦有我志，歲寒多雲霜，松栢終無異，吁嗟念遠人，戚戚靡所寄，皓魄又團　，我心常如醉</p>

<h3>熱水瓶怎樣能保持常温</h3>
<p>— 慶</p>
<p>盛沸水或冰水在普通的器皿裏，能在不久的時間内，同器外的溫度調匀，結果沸水會减低溫度，　冰水會增加溫度，　與器外的溫度不相上下；這個事實早已被我們證明了!旣然這樣，所以我們在冰天裏要藏些熱水，或熱天裏要藏些冰水，都是很困難的了！大家因爲受了這個困難，於是就從事着想，向着這難點攻去，終於熱水瓶被發明了！到現在，幾乎家家都備，成爲日常的必需品了！我們受牠的恩惠，也决不祇一二，這都是發明者雕阿（Ｄewar）給予我們的啊！我們不能像他一樣地發明，但是是至少也要曉得牠的原理才好！所以我特地把在下寫面牠··</p>
<p>通常轉熱的方法有下列三種··（傳導）　牠能使器内的溫度及器外的溫　　度，由器壁傳導，面至平均溫　　度；像冰汽水等，都是這個作用（二）對流　牠能將兩個溫度不齊的物處，　　起互流作用，高溫的流向低溫　　去，同時低溫的也流向高溫來　　，這樣不息的流着·不久就會　　使這兩個物體的溫度平均起來　　；像煑水，生火爐等，都是這　　個作用。</p>
<p>（三）幅射　有一種熱，是常常在光裏射來　　的，牠也能將溫度不同的兩個　　物體調匀；像對日光曝昞，或　　朝着火光坐的時侯，都會感覺　　到有一種熱。這種决不是［　　傳導］或［對流］作用而發生的　　，乃是另一種作用，就是所謂　　［幅射］</p>
<p>有了這三種作用，就會使普通器；皿裏液體的溫度同器外的漸調匀，所以藏熱或藏冷要發生困難了，熱水瓶的搆造，就是要抵禁這三種作用；牠是雙層塗銀色的玻璃板做的，在二層中間，抽去空氣成爲眞空（底邊的尖頭就是抽去空氣的痕跡，）因爲眞空及玻璃板可以抵禦［一］，［二］兩個作用，光亮的銀色，會反射外來的光，可以抵禦［幅射］作用；這樣很簡便地一來，三種傳熱的作用都被抵禦了！所以盛沸水或冰水在裏面，可以隔絶外邊的溫度，再没有在短時間内同外邊的溫度調匀而失其常溫之虞了！至於牠外表的金屬殻子，是因爲保護玻璃用的，副作用就是裝璜。</p>

<h3>改良社會討論會</h3>
<h3>對改良吃飯的討論</h3>
<p>— 叔夏</p>
<p>怡怡館主在本刋發表［改良吃飯］問題，他的意思，大約是··改［共食主義］而爲［分食主義］。</p>
<p>共食分食的利弊，讀者想可明瞭，此處無庸詳贅··第改良其形式，而並其精義亦改去，我却以爲不可</p>
<p>共食最大的危險，就是大家箸和匙的掏洗，容易傳染疾病，要改良此事，早已有人改良和實行，即備具二副箸匙，一以取菜，一以取食，此種改良，我說··不但麻煩而容易纏錯；恐於防制傳染，仍舊毫無裨益，因爲一以取菜，一以取食，病菌固難直接到口，豈不是一樣可以間接的傳染麽？至於因改良此種傳染，不惜犧牲了共食的種種好處，欲全變爲歐美化的分食，此種改良，不是近於因噎廢食，就是類於盲從。</p>
<p>要知共食與分食，其所以均能維持千百年而根本不至改變者·實因歐亞日胃的互異，和習慣使然的緣故，同時，各主義有各的利弊，利處，自然　口胃而愈見其適宜，弊處，也因習慣而不覺其有如何不妥，譬如麵食的人，驟然强其永吃米食，雖佳肴满桌，恐難適合口胃，米食的人，日日吃西餐，也要倒口胃，這是人人多能知道的，至於人所不注意的數菜合吃與數菜分吃的一層，我却以爲其中利弊關係，最有討論的必要　，按中菜有炒燴煑烹烤種種方法的不同，而酸甜苦辣鹹，亦各有其時味，數菜合食呢，分量和五味，臨時可任食客的意思，取多取少，支配而調劑之，其中實合有一種說不出的化合作用，這是中式數菜合吃，與不得不共食之精義，絶非西式數菜分吃，可以望其項背，更非不中不西，改變一湯一菜的分食制，所可同日而語，（註；中式筵席，菜多不合食，極不衛生，）至於說到改良傳染疾病一層，我以爲極不費事，祇要改造盛湯菜的碗盆即可，其法於製造時，把每個碗盆中，分隔不等分的，或等分的八格，或十格，如菓盤然，（吃飯通例，八人一桌，十格的，用於圓桌筵席，）碗盆的大小，和通常用的，可稍微放大，烹飪的人，把每菜盛入碗盆時，可照格大小，盛入菜之多少，如格一樣大小，盛入的菜，亦一樣多少經濟一些的，並可於食前，預計幾人吃飯，即把菜盛入幾格，吃飯的人，即認格取菜。　　　爲什麽要用不等分的格呢，因爲家庭一桌吃飯，人和量·旣有大小，口胃嗜好，亦復不能强同，不等分的，不便利各人的取舍，而調劑其口胃，爲什麽又要用等分的呢，因爲學校工廠中，人的年齡和需要，没有多大的出入，故宜均匀分食，免致爭執，這種共分而共食的主義，旣合衛生，同時，比之西餐中食，尤覺經濟，甚願與讀者急起改良，如有指正之處，尤所歡迎！</p>
<h3>答改良社會討論會書後</h3>
<p>— 四維</p>
<p>對於二十一年七月二十五日懷靜誠君在申報上發表對於改良男女服裝的建議，和八月一日程鵬君亦在附刋上披露對於該問題的商榷，前者誠然如程鵬君說的話［我以爲中國人現有怪樣子，已經很夠十足，儘不可必創新花樣了］後者鄙人亦未敢深加贊同吧，</p>
<p>鵬君是不是一個軍人，社會學配不配軍人談，那是誰都知道的，不果旣是一個軍人，在軍言軍，自譽固屬虛文，自棄亦爲可恥，據說［美報記者曾有一見蔣總司令身穿中山裝，該記者登載談話中，謂蔣氏裝束，酷似咖啡館之侍者］敢問我最親愛的鵬君呀，貴國在那裏？你是什麽人？鵬君旣然根據美報記者的目光中以看待身穿中山裝者，爲酷似咖啡館之侍者，難道說反不及歐美各國的工農和身穿西裝的呌化子麽？我不懂鵬君是何用意，而說出民國以來並未創製新服，祇有暫穿西裝，可見西裝襲人之深，易人之俗，未必人人都像鵬君一般吧，</p>
<p>至於女子的短褲薄襪，旣有好的大衣爲之保住溫度，况醫師說過，兩腿凍不壞，中國的氣候，本無亞拉斯加的冷</p>
<p>，但是摩登又摩登，不久的將來，儘可提倡實行由裸腿而體亦可裸，蟬翼輕絲，對於研究曲線美，終覺有層隔膜，到不如渾身上下，一絲不掛，妖艶過市，那末到了那個時代，我雖不殺伯仁，伯仁亦由我而死呢，</p>
<p>學堂寫眞</p>
<h3>暑期學校素描</h3>
<p>— 曼倩</p>
<p>我說··［暑期學校是公子哥兒們的園地。］因爲貧家子弟照例的學費都拿不出，何况在暑期學校裏一個月的費用　要此數　當然的，呌公子哥兒們化起來，一定還到超過·</p>
<p>在敎務處的佈告板上，揭示了各種課程的讀本，現在我單說他們的價格吧；化學八元，數學七元，簿記五元····啊！我眞不懂·在短促的一個月裏·用偌大的價格，買來這幾本厚厚的書，不知結果能夠敎丁幾頁？不錯！我忘了，公子哥兒們有的是錢啊！</p>
<p>這是裏面敎員的一部份··本來事務主任，現在　在着英文，敎歷史的王先生也敎起英文來了，體育指導却敎了化學。所以這樣的生拖硬扯，無非是校長先生的經濟政策，省得另外聘請的　煩，雖然這種功課，不是他們的專長，但是看在金錢的面上、也祇勉爲其難的試騐一下了！好在時間　有一個月。</p>
<p>體育指導上第一課化學就這樣的說··［因爲恐怕來不及赶完這本四百多頁的書本子，所以關於裏面的試騐部份，一槪從略了，以求牠速率的加快！］當然的，事務主任和敎歷史的王先生在上他們第一課的時候，也有異曲同工的這篇話！</p>
<p>在暑期中正是一年裏面最熱的時候，因爲這樣，所以西瓜皮弄得满地，汽水瓶是滾東倒西；在暑期學校的學生宿舍裏，這種情形是隨時可以看見　呵！這才表現出天之驕子　學生　的富裕！</p>
<h3>告六逆</h3>
<p>— 士·本·</p>
<p>我的親戚沈老爺，八字生得好，祖宗丢下不少的遺産，加上自已當家到現在，二十年裏面，手段靈滑，辦事穏健敏捷，所以又添了十多萬資産，連頭帶脚算算，他可稱有百萬之富了。</p>
<p>他雖則擁了這麽大的財産，但是還是銅鈿眼裏串跟斗，一個小錢都不肯輕易化掉，有時人們勸勸他，［做個人，</p>
<p>活在世間，樂得享享福，吃點着點，有了這樣大的財産，還這麽做人家，將來死了，帶不到棺裏去的，］他回答道，［我不是絶尾巴的人，爛吃爛用，現在稍爲節省點，留給子孫圖個溫飽，省得將來没飯吃，埋怨着老子哩，］原來他有兩個兒子，一個女兒，女兒已經嫁給人家，嫁的夫家，起先還好，後來因爲女婿不成器，把家産敗完，弄得女兒生活困難，時常哭喪着臉，回來和老子拌嘴，要求補助生計，但是他是一個仍舊具着十八世紀頭腦的兒物，祇重男而不重女，所以在他女人向他開口要求時，必定面孔板得鐡靑似的，根嚴厲地說，［嫁出女兒潑出水］。</p>
<p>他全不顧父女之情，絲毫不肯憐惜她，憑你幾次三番哭着求着，但是他始終認定（女兒外頭人）的目標，而不來施佈一錢，後來她見父親這樣無情理的拒絶要求，心想這件事，若不吃靈法律，到底達不到勝利的目的，於是馬上去託人進行訴訟，但是事先被族裏的族長知道了，以爲父女是有密切的情感，不當一時不睦而就此决裂，被人所嘲笑，所以馬上呌她去叮囑，暫緩進行，由族長出而調解，她見有人來打圓塲，也就表示容纳，那知族長跑去，把情形告知她父親，勸他維持父女情感，以免彼此决裂，引起訟事，他竟满嘴裏連說，［放屁放屁，女兒告爺，那還了得，哼哼，憑他告到皇帝身邊，單有告五（忤）逆，而没有告六逆的，你們不要說了，我的錢，祇有兒子好用，怎麽呌她少生一點？］族長受飽了屁的臭氣，曉得他頭腦冬烘，難以理喻，於是就退出回去，作壁上觀，靜看他們父女的厮殺。</p>
<p>她在族長取銷調解責任後，就跑到有名Ｘ律師處，請求救濟，Ｘ律師聽了</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>，說道，［女士！你的目標要求補助生計，我看來太小啊，現在是男女平等，你老子的産業，女士也是有權享受的，現在要起訴，應當從大的着想啊，］律師對於爭産案，最有味道，所以這樣地慫恿她。</p>
<p>一個月之後女控父的案件，判决了，照現行法律，男女平等，女子也有承繼權，天然她是勝訴的，但是在那個頭腦陳腐的沈老爺，接到敗訴的判决書後，不由的暴跳如雷，嘴裏連稱［反了反了，瘟官斷出這種道理來，六逆官司打得赢，人家養不得女兒了。］</p>
<p>家庭問題</p>
<h3>悲劇的一幕</h3>
<p>— 晉</p>
<p>還是前年的夏天，我獨自去拜訪友人羅君夫婦，當時羅君不在，只有他的妻孤仃地在苦痛的呻呤？你該知道；當你一個人面對着一個病人的時候，你定會感着侷促不安。假如你没有更好的方法處理這種困難，那末你就得陪着他流淚。當然，我當時眞是窘極了，但是我没有適當的理由可以遽然離開她，於是我得坐在她的床緣而和她勉强對答了？</p>
<p>［可是胃氣痛嗎？你這樣的苦痛。］我說？</p>
<p>［哎·····不是的，我在打胎；我已吃了打胎藥了！］</p>
<p>［噢？打胎？你爲什麽呀！］　　［哎！有什麽好說呢？他要我打的］，當然我只得依從他，因爲我没有能力來養活我那未來的嬰孩呀！可是···哎！有什麽好說，我只有哭···哭罷了！］</p>
<p>於是盡情的哭，雙手捧着臉，兩隻肩　不住的抽動着。當時我完全爲她的悲哀所襲擊，我覺得十分酸楚，她的眼淚，每一粒都打在我的心頭。而且我凄然的默念着··［對的，是她的丈夫命令她如此做的，在她，在她有什麽辦法呢？］我始終没能力忍住我的眼淚。隨後我又聽得她拭着眼角說··</p>
<p>［我和他結婚快要兩週年了。他所能給與我的只是日常生活的敷衍。譬如說罷，他從來就不曾帶我一同去看一次電影，而他自已却是差不多每天都去。假如我有意的問他到那裏去了？當然他自會有許多方法掩飾過去？由此一端便可知道他是過分厭惡我的。固然我自已知道我並不漂亮，而且又是這樣老了，假如一定要跟着他一同走，不免會使他難看。我愛他，我十分忠誠的愛他，我何必定要在人們面前使他掃臉呢？可是我的心，我的心啊　眞是苦痛極了。這是他不會知道的，即使是知道，他又何常願意諒解我呢？······我肚裏的將死的小生命，總算是我們兩年來的愛的結晶，然而現在他要戕殺他，他已刻毒的將他殺害了！不過我知道我始　是會被他拚棄的·我只在等候那可怕的時間到臨，那末我爲什麽要留着這將是没有父親的孩子來加重我將來的負担呢？哦！他是如何的刻毒啊！我深深的體味到我的不幸了。］</p>
<p>當我回家的時候，我立刻在腦筋中浮出羅君的那溫雅的態度來。那司迪克，那雪茄烟，還有風流的小鬍子。不過這兒究是如何殘酷的舉動啊！我爲他們可怕的結果而戰慄。</p>
<p>Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ</p>
<p>整整的隔了二年，今天我又遇着羅君了。我熱的握着他的手，我問他說；　　［好嗎？］</p>
<p>［謝謝你，很好！］</p>
<p>［夫人好嗎？］可是他停了半響才說··　　［我想她現在還是很好的吧，不過；我已和她離婚了。］　　我只得默然無語</p>

<h3>The Crisis of Chinese Enterprises　　Zi ·</h3>
<p>While the Chinese people are responding to Japan's military aggression with economic severance, the Japanese are actually preparing countermeasures sufficient to sweep away Chinese enterprises. This is what we should seriously pay attention to and further consider how to respond to. The monthly publication [Toyo Trade Research] published by the Industrial Survey Department of the Osaka Municipal Office in Japan, in its July issue, contains an article discussing the Manchurian and Shanghai incidents and Japan's trade with China. The last paragraph reveals [Trade Countermeasures Based on a Non-Japanese Premise]. The key points are translated below, with explanations added on the left. The original text states, "When discussing countermeasures based on anti-Japanese sentiment, one should first focus on the progress of Chinese enterprises. The past investment in China is estimated to be approximately 400 million yuan, with the textile industry accounting for more than 200 million yuan as a mixed industry. However, the operating performance of these various enterprises is difficult to achieve excellent results. This is due to the Chinese government's blatant anti-foreign policies, which treat products with discrimination, and the frequent occurrence of strikes due to racial prejudice. On the other hand, the sales of products from enterprises in China are limited to the domestic market and are constantly competing with Chinese products, and imported goods are also similarly affected by the anti-Japanese wave. It should also be considered that many Japanese enterprises that took advantage of low silver prices to invest have failed. In addition to the aforementioned external obstacles, the insufficient capital amount should also be blamed. Therefore, in the future, for new enterprises in China, a considerable amount of capital is necessary. At the same time, by expanding the scale of factories and improving products, the sales channels should be gradually expanded to overseas markets to establish a broad business policy, which is the most cost-effective. It is also [a method to avoid the impact of boycotts]."</p>
<p>This passage, although not as aggressively worded as the statements of Japanese militarists, nor as sharply pointed as the arguments of Japanese politicians, in practice, the realization of a new economic invasion policy is sufficient to sweep away all Chinese enterprises, plunging them into a state of eternal ruin. This is more covert than what the militarists and politicians intend to achieve. Their so-called expansion of enterprises in China with substantial capital, changing the export of goods to the export of capital, and changing the competition of commercial goods to the competition of industries, is indeed a wicked strategy to control the fate of Chinese enterprises. China possesses abundant raw materials and a large number of low-wage laborers, but its capital utilization and industrial technology are both very immature. Once Japan vigorously invades with considerable capital and its industrial technology, it will be extremely difficult for domestic enterprises to compete with it. If they cannot compete, they will only be forced to perish together. The past example of Chinese yarn factories being suppressed by the Japanese, and the failure of small industries under the pressure of large industries in economic history, serve as a clear warning. This is the first thing we should pay attention to. Their so-called expansion of sales channels of products from enterprises in China to overseas markets aims to reap all the benefits of direct investment in economics, controlling China's business community and leaving no hope of recovery. If the Japanese achieve this goal, then in the future, China's international trade, while trade deficits are harmful, even if there is a day of trade surplus, the profits will all be reaped by the Japanese. China's low wages and abundant raw materials will only be used by Japanese enterprises in China. We have already seen the oppression of the Chinese cotton yarn market by Japanese yarn factories in China. The Japanese are also preparing to achieve more with their products in China. This is not only a crisis for Chinese enterprises, but also the clothing and supplies used by the Chinese people will be completely manipulated by Japanese trade, leaving no room for autonomy. This is another thing we should pay attention to.</p>
<p>How will our immature business community respond to the so-called trade countermeasures of the Japanese? This is indeed a more important issue than the boycott of goods.</p>

<p>Situation on the Rehe Border</p>
<h3>Temporarily No Significant Changes</h3>
<p>(Shanhaiguan) Although the Japanese army is eager to seize Rehe, based on the general situation, there are unlikely to be any drastic actions in the short term.

<p>The Supervisory Yuan Impeaches the Jiangxi Provincial Government</p>
<h3>Illegally Collecting Production and Sales Taxes</h3>
<p>(Location Obscured) Luo Jiefu, a supervisory committee member of the Supervisory Yuan, impeached the Jiangxi Provincial Government for illegally collecting production and sales taxes, causing great hardship to the people.

<h3>Lu Chao Reports on the Handling of the Opium Case</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Lu Chao hosted the press and reported on the handling of the intercepted opium case. He stated that on the 19th of last month, Xiao Qin, the section chief of his office, accompanied by clerk Fan Guorui, returned to Nanjing from Luoyang by special train. After arriving in Nanjing, four suitcases of opium were discovered. An investigation revealed that the public servant Ren Zhongkun had handed them over to Fan Guorui in Luoyang to bring to Nanjing. After telegraphed inquiries to Luoyang, Ren Zhongkun was detained and imprisoned in the Luoyang County jail while an investigation was launched into the circumstances surrounding the incident in Luoyang. It was discovered that Wang Jisan (also known as Wang Runsan), the owner of the Zhongxi Hotel, had introduced opium dealer Rong Jidi (also known as Rong Angsun) to Ren Zhongkun. Ren then entrusted Fan Guorui to transport the opium to Nanjing, taking advantage of the special train and disguising it as the luggage of an official. An immediate telegram was sent to Tian Shijie, director of the Nanjing office, instructing him to detain the contraband, open the suitcases for inspection, and cooperate with the military police in apprehending the opium dealers. Ren Zhongkun was escorted to Nanjing, and a committee composed of military advisers, section chiefs, and group leaders in Nanjing was formed to conduct an inquiry. The results of the continuous investigation matched the findings in Luoyang. Except for opium dealer Rong Jidi, who remains at large, all the relevant documentation regarding Ren Zhongkun, the contraband, and the facts obtained in both Nanjing and Luoyang were sent to the Nanjing District Court on the 3rd of this month for strict investigation and legal action. Although clerk Fan Guorui has not been directly confronted, he is highly suspected and has been dismissed from his position and placed under supervision for court inquiries. Section chief Xiao Qin, although unaware of the situation beforehand, was able to detect the opium upon arrival in Nanjing, which is somewhat excusable, and has been given a demerit. The entire handling process has been reported to Chairman Lin Sen, and he has requested punishment for himself. (4th Instant Telegram)</p>

<p>▲Reuters, Washington, 3rd – According to news from the capitals of Bolivia and Paraguay, an unofficial war is underway in the Chaco forest region on the border between the two countries. Bolivian troops have occupied Paraguayan forts. It seems that declaring war without declaration is not limited to the East. Both countries are quickly preparing for war, and Argentina is also deploying troops to the Argentine-Bolivian border to protect Argentina's neutrality. The Paraguayan government has now issued a general mobilization order because Bolivia has already taken this step. A telegram from Asuncion states that the Paraguayan army has very few soldiers, and 500 have already been sent to the Chaco. Many civilians are volunteering to join the army, and 300 have applied to the authorities for permission to join the military. At the same time, women are also planning to organize a women's army. A telegram from La Paz states that the Bolivian Minister of War has conscripted all men in the country between the ages of 22 and 29. Bolivian planes have bombed Mennonite colonies. The League of Nations has called on the two countries to reconcile, and it is expected that the Bolivian government will respond that Bolivia does not pay attention to Paraguay's appeal to the League of Nations. Bolivia is determined to seek a final solution to the Chaco region dispute, even if it requires the use of force.</p>
<p>▲Guomin News Agency, Asuncion, 3rd – The tension between Paraguay and Bolivia in the Chaco dispute is increasing almost hourly. Even with the efforts of neutral countries to mediate, the outbreak of war is only a matter of time. Today, the President of Paraguay issued a military mobilization order and called on the people of the country to organize volunteer soldiers, encouraging them to move forward and win against Bolivia.</p>
<p>▲Guomin News Agency, Washington, 3rd – The United States and eighteen other countries in the Western Hemisphere signed a declaration today, stating that they do not recognize territorial rights obtained by force. This declaration has been sent to the governments of Bolivia and Paraguay, indicating that the occupation of the Chaco plateau by force will not be recognized by various countries.</p>
<p>▲Guomin News Agency, Geneva, 3rd – League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond announced this afternoon that the League of Nations has received a message from Paraguay stating that it is willing to accept arbitration on the Chaco border dispute and immediately telegraphed the message to the Bolivian government, along with a letter asking the Bolivian government what steps it is willing to take to resolve the case peacefully.</p>
<p>▲Guomin News Agency, London, 3rd – The British Foreign Office announced today that the acting Secretary-General of the League of Nations had asked the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain to support the League of Nations' proposal on August 1 to ask Bolivia and Paraguay to resolve the dispute peacefully. The United Kingdom has complied and requested that the matter be resolved through diplomatic channels.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, La Paz, 4th – Bolivia has issued a response to the League of Nations' advice to resolve the Bolivian-Paraguayan dispute peacefully, stating that Bolivia is willing to accept a peaceful method of ending the conflict and resolving the dispute between the two countries, but the facts place Paraguay outside the law and force Bolivia to defend itself with force.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Washington, 3rd – The conflict between Bolivia and Paraguay is due to a dispute over ownership of the Chaco region, which covers 100,000 square miles. Its boundaries have never been accurately defined, and the dispute has been going on for over 50 years. Both sides can present charters and orders issued by the former Spanish Empire in the Americas to prove the legitimacy of their claims. Both countries occupy parts of the disputed area and have built forts there, forming a confrontation, so conflicts occur from time to time.</p>
<p>▲Havas, Paris, 3rd – War clouds are gathering over Bolivia and Paraguay in South America due to a border dispute that has been brewing for more than 50 years. The Spanish Empire's Constitution of 1553 stipulated that the confluence of the Pilcomayo and Paraguay rivers should be the common border between Bolivia and Paraguay. Since then, Bolivia has focused on the development of the west, and Paraguayans have been constantly invading the east, known as the Gran Chaco (according to Bolivia). In 1927, Argentina mediated and the two countries signed a protocol to resolve the border issue, but it was never signed. In 1928, Paraguayan troops captured the Bolivian fortress of Vanguardia, and Bolivian troops occupied the Paraguayan fortress of Boquerón in retaliation. Since then, a Washington-based arbitration committee has ordered both sides to return the occupied fortresses. In 1931, a mediation committee was organized in Washington and drafted a protocol, but it was stopped due to Paraguay's reservations. On June 29 of this year, Paraguayan troops suddenly attacked the Bolivian fortress of Santa Cruz, and on July 15 and 25, they attacked the same fortress and another Bolivian fortress called Florida. The Bolivian embassy announced that Bolivian troops are occupying the Paraguayan fortresses of Corrales, Toledo, and Boquerón because of this action by Paraguayan troops.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Clique Plans Armed Immigration to the Northeast</h3>
<p>Civilian Factories Rush to Manufacture Military Equipment</p>
<p>Accumulating Fuel and Actively Preparing for War</p>
<p>▲Japan News Agency, Tokyo, 4th – The Ministry of the Army is now planning to implement an armed immigration plan as the first step in the policy of immigration to Manchuria. The content is generally as follows: The qualifications for immigrants are limited to demobilized soldiers who are willing to immigrate. 500 people will be a group, and they will first start immigrating to Yilan. Each person will be given 1,000 yuan or 1,500 yuan. The total cost of the project will be 10 million yuan or 15 million yuan over ten years.</p>
<p>▲Japan News Agency, Tokyo, 4th – In order to help small and medium-sized merchants and industrialists, the authorities of the Ministry of the Army are implementing the established plan regarding combat materials ahead of schedule, ordering civilian factories to manufacture military equipment, and including its expenses of 43 million yuan in temporary expenses.

If the negotiations between the two parties can be established, it will be submitted to the temporary parliament for approval.</p>
<p>▲China News Agency, Tokyo, 4th – Japanese Minister of the Navy Okada visited Finance Minister Takahashi at his official residence today to discuss the Navy's proposal to the Diet, which will open on August 22.

The required funding is about 40 to 50 million yuan, and he hopes that the Ministry of Finance will give special consideration to it. The Japanese army is doing its best to prepare for war under the pretext of helping unemployed workers, which is very concerning.</p>

<p>Preparations are underway for the</p>
<h3>World Economic Conference</h3>
<p>The Silver Price Problem Will Be the Focus of Discussion</p>
<p>The Location is Planned to Be in London, the Date is Undetermined</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 3rd – According to the current preliminary preparations, the first issue that the World Economic Conference will need to discuss in the future is the price of silver, but the three important issues of tariffs, reparations, and war debts will be put on hold. British Foreign Secretary Sidney was previously elected as Chairman of the League of Nations Special Committee to handle the preparatory work for this conference and will soon issue a request to the representatives of the countries that are members of the preparatory committee. In addition to the United Kingdom, there are the United States, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Belgium, and Norway. Sidney will ask them to meet immediately and begin the preparatory work before the conference. This conference may be called the World Currency and Financial Conference. The above-mentioned eight countries may each send two representatives to participate in the conference, and other countries will also be invited to participate. The venue for the conference is likely to be in London, but the date will depend on the outcome of the US presidential election in early November.</p>
<h3>The Cabinet Will Not Shake After the German Congressional Reelection</h3>
<p>Prime Minister von Papen Considers Himself Transcendental</p>
<p>Not Subject to the Control of Any Force</p>
<p>▲Guomin News Agency, Berlin, 3rd – Since the German election, various unfounded speculations have emerged in various countries, with many doubts about the future of German internal affairs. However, according to the most reliable sources, German Chancellor von Papen has decided that any excessive demands made to the cabinet, such as the reorganization of the cabinet, etc., will be completely ignored by Papen. Von Papen's cabinet considers itself transcendental, so it can continue to stand outside the political tide and not be subject to the coercion of any party, and President Hindenburg also holds the same view. After the National Socialist Party gained power in the election, there were voices demanding the reorganization of the cabinet, but according to von Papen's view, members of the National Socialist Party may not be added to the cabinet in the future. If there are truly talented people in the National Socialist Party, they can be put forward for discussion. If the person is indeed competent, he should be appointed to a difficult position as a national talent, and not occupy an important position as a party member.</p>
<h3>Willing to Defend the Country with the Last Drop of Blood</h3>

At that time, a whole regiment expressed their loyalty and actually rushed into the sea. Fortunately, the beach was shallow, and the soldiers all dipped their swords in saltwater and returned to shore.</p>

<h3>19th Route Army Recaptures Longtan</h3>
<p>▲ Red Bandits Retreat from Baisha to Changting</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The important nests of the Red Bandits in Fujian and Jiangxi are mostly located in Ruijin, Shicheng, Yu, and Huichang. The bandit masses are scattered on the Jiangxi border.</p>
<p>Since the battle on the Guangdong-Jiangxi border, the bandits have also suddenly changed their strategy, creating disturbances in Shixing, Heping, and Yongding, while withdrawing their main force towards Huichang and Ruijin. However, a bandit force of over 1,000 men from western Fujian, led by Luo Binghui, advanced from Changting during the Guangdong-Jiangxi border war and captured Longtan in Yongding, harassing Chendongkeng and Xiayang Zhongkeng, approaching the Dabu County border in Guangdong. The Fujian militia were no match and either retreated into the mountains or came to Dabu County. Refugees from Hulie and Fushi were escorted by the militia to Yongding City and then into Guangdong to escape. At that time, Yongding City was still garrisoned by the Ye regiment of the Guangdong Army's Huang Renhuan Division. However, due to the small size of the force and the local communists surrounding the city, troops were not dispatched to attack. Liang Ruogu, the magistrate of Dabu County, seeing the situation worsening, telegraphed Meixian for troops. Huang Yanzhen of the 7th Division dispatched the Zhi Chun regiment to garrison Shishang and advance on Zhongkeng and Xiayang. Upon hearing that the Guangdong Army had arrived, the Luo bandits moved all the people and property they had plundered and gathered in Chendongkeng to Longtan. Taking advantage of this opportunity, the militia recovered Dongkeng. Chendongkeng in Xiayang suffered a great disaster, with private property losses estimated at over a million yuan and approximately three to four thousand people killed, wounded, or captured. However, on July 28th, Dong Xiong of the Hulie militia reported that the 19th Route Army arrived in Shizhong on the 25th, and Liu Zhanxiong and Yang Fuqiang's regiments recaptured Longtan on the 26th. Luo then dared not to fight and fled from Baisha back to Changting. The 19th Route Army has now linked up with the Huang Renhuan Division of the Guangdong Army stationed in Shanghang and Yongding and is expected to advance towards Changting, Liancheng, and Yong'an to recover the lost territory in western Fujian. However, the Red Bandits consider Changting to be the rear guard of Ruijin and will definitely defend it firmly. Since hearing of the 19th Route Army's arrival in Longtan, the pseudo-central government in Ruijin has mobilized the 16th, 18th, and 23rd armies of the Red Bandits to Changting, under the command of Luo Binghui, gathering bandit masses in the ancient city between Fujian and Jiangxi. New-style trenches have been set up from Changting to Liancheng and Hetian. The pseudo-organizations in Ting City have all moved out of the city to Sanyuanling. It is suspected that the Luo bandits intend to resist the 19th Route Army in Changting. (August Date Omitted)</p>
<h3>Guangzhou: Devastating Flood Disaster</h3>
<p>▲ Over 600 Houses Collapsed, Over 800 Casualties</p>
<p>▲ Over a Hundred Elderly Women Drowned in the Poorhouse, Two Hundred Injured</p>
<p>Since a week ago, Guangdong Province has been experiencing continuous torrential rain. Water has accumulated everywhere, and the Pearl River's current has become turbulent, with the river rising suddenly by over ten feet. In the North River area, mountain torrents along the Yuehan Railway have erupted, flooding villages to a depth of five or six feet. After midnight on July 29th, heavy wind and incessant rain fell like an inverted silver river, not stopping all night. The rain could not be discharged in time and flooded the suburbs, drowning five or six hundred people and collapsing over six hundred houses. In Guangzhou, this was the worst flood since the Yimao year (1915). The cause of the disaster was the torrential flow of mountain torrents from the northern part of the city, which flowed down to the foothills. The low-lying areas in the northeastern suburbs were transformed into swamps. During the rain, the water level on flat ground was over thirteen or fourteen feet. In the past, the six canal system that ran through the city could discharge the water. Now, the new-style roads and narrow channels in the city are small and not interconnected, and the six canals are silted up. Therefore, when mountain floods erupt, the city and suburbs inevitably suffer. On the night of the torrential rain, the mountain torrents gushed down, and at the same time, the Pearl River overflowed its banks, turning the embankments and roads into a vast expanse of water. In recent years, the municipal authorities have filled in the Haizhu River, creating thousands of wells of beachland in order to expand the urban area, narrowing the Pearl River's surface. Whenever there is heavy rain, the river easily floods both banks. Therefore, on the night of July 29th, the Pearl River overflowed both banks due to the heavy rain. The water level in the Huitong Temple area in Henan also reached three or four feet. Therefore, even if the northern rain and torrents were guided into the Pearl River by the old six canals, they would be blocked by the turbulent waters of the Pearl River and inevitably return to the city, forming a vast swamp. Therefore, the city's flood disaster was caused by the inappropriate design and arrangement of roads and channels, the silting up of the old six canals, and the filling in of the Haizhu River, which narrowed the river surface and made it difficult for the water to flow smoothly. The sudden eruption of rain and floods occurred at one or two in the morning, when the citizens were unprepared. Therefore, the number of casualties reached over eight hundred. In the northeastern part of the old city, the disaster area was the Dexuan Branch District, including Mango Tree Street, Fangbei Zhi Street, Liantang Road, and Xinglong Street. In the Xiaobei Branch District, the water level in Dashi Street, Xiaoshi Street, and Tianping Heng Street was six or seven feet. Police stations used boats to rescue hundreds of refugees from the submerged low houses and temporarily settled them in charitable institutions. In Tian'guanli, Renheli, Haoxian Street, Zhafen Street, Yahetang, and Fangcao Street in Xiaobei Road, the water level was about five feet. Children from households in Tian'guanli were carried out by adults to Xiaobei Road to escape. Women used doors as rafts, floating and sinking. Four or five hundred stranded citizens huddled in the rain by Xiaobei Road. The worst hit area was the Qianlutou at the end of Beiheng Street, which had one old men's welfare home and one old women's welfare home. The women's welfare home was located in the old Qianju back corner, which was the lowest point. On the side of the courtyard was an old sluice gate called Tongguan, which was used to block the water source in the eastern suburbs. Therefore, whenever there was heavy rain, the accumulated water would not flood the streets of Dongguan, and it was a barrier for the Dongguan area. On the night of the 29th, the rainwater came from Yunshan, Guanyinshan, and Ji Yicheng, with powerful and fierce water force, and finally broke through the Tongguan sluice gate. The first to bear the brunt was the local female poor people's old courtyard. In an instant, the water depth in the courtyard was more than ten feet. At that time, there were more than 300 old women in the courtyard, who were at a loss, and only 200 were rescued. Ninety-seven people drowned on the spot, and dozens were injured. The bodies that were fished out were transported to nearby cremations by convenient hospitals. In addition, there were more than 40 deaths and injuries in the Dexuan Branch District in each disaster area, and there were many other deaths and injuries. According to statistics, there are more than 800. Here is a brief summary of the number of collapses and the number of casualties in the disaster area on the evening of 29th and 30th morning.

According to statistics from the Fire Department, as of the morning of the 30th, more than 550 houses were reported to have collapsed, and about 200 people were drowned. About 200 injured people were rescued, and thousands of refugees were counted. There were more than 300 refugees in Aiyutang, more than 200 in Guangji Shantang, more than 200 in Fangbian Hospital, more than 100 in Huihang Shanyuan, and Shudeshantang and Zhide Infant Yuan. , Simiao Shantang, all have refugee shelters, the Public Security Bureau, the Health Bureau, the Public Works Bureau, and the Social Affairs Bureau, all directors personally inspect the disaster areas and discuss relief measures. It has been raining continuously for several days, and the people of the city are all wary. The number of collapsed houses and casualties may be more than the above-mentioned number. Recently, the cholera epidemic in the city has just been eliminated, but suddenly this flood has been encountered, it is a real disaster. (July 30th)</p>

<h3>Reason for the Ministry of Railways' Reappointment of Feng Jiantong</h3>
<p>The Reappointment of Feng Jiantong, a Dismissed Official, by the Ministry of Railways Has Been Widely Debated in Newspapers. This Reporter Believes That the Issue Is About the Appointment of Private Individuals by Administrative Leaders and That It Is Necessary to Investigate the Facts to Clarify the Truth. The Details Obtained From the Investigation Are Recorded as Follows: It Has Been Found That Feng Jiantong Originally Served as the Chief of the Tongliao Section of the Beining Railway. During the September 18th Incident Last Year, the Beining Railway Authorities Submitted a Request to the Ministry of Railways That He Never Be Reappointed on the Grounds That He Was Suspected of Retreating, in Order to Show Punishment. In November, Gao Jiyi, Director of the Beining Railway Bureau, Believed That Although He Had Made Mistakes, He Was Truly Capable and That It Would Be a Waste to Leave Him Idle. He Sent a Letter to Lian Shenghai, the Former Minister of Railways, Asking for His Reinstatement. The Letter Said, "Minister Lian Shenggong's Guidance: Feng Jiantong, the Chief of the Tongliao Section of Our Railway, Repeatedly Retreating When the Japanese Army and Mongolian Bandits Approached Tongliao, Was Forced to Return to His Original Station to Serve. Later, the Section Chief, In Light of the Urgent Situation, Without Any Guarantee, Requested a Long Leave. Our Bureau Had Previously Issued an Order That All Employees Were Not Allowed to Retreat Unless Driven Away by the Japanese Army's Force. Those Who Violated This Would Be Punished. It Was Difficult to Approve His Request for a Long Leave. In Order to Rectify Discipline and Maintain Prestige, We Had No Choice but to Remove the Section Chief. However, It Was Found That the Section Chief Had Learning and Experience, Which I Have Always Admired. He Has Served in the Railway for Many Years, Working Seriously, Not Shying Away From Hardship and Complaints, and He Has Been of Great Help. His Removal Was Purely to Inspire and Sacrifice His Personal Position in Order to Warn All Employees to Serve More Peacefully. Moreover, He Is Truly a Useful Talent for the Country, and It Would Not Be Appropriate to Leave Him Idle. I Dare to Clarify the Circumstances and Humbly Request Your Seat to Consider Cultivating Him in Your Ministry or Other State-Owned Railways, So That He Can Be Inspired to Repay Your Kindness." Director Gao Jiyi Reverently Wrote. Afterwards, Labor Mian, Deputy Director of the Beining Railway Bureau, Also Sent a Letter to Minister Lian, His Words Were Even More Sincere. At That Time, the Ministry of Railways Did Not Discuss This Matter Because of the Frequent Changes of Officials. When Gu Mengyu Arrived, Feng Jiantong Heard That Gu Has Always Advocated That People Only Ask About Talent, No Matter What Their Origins, so he immediately sent a letter to see Gu. Gu Had No Knowledge of Feng at That Time, and He Did Not Know That He Had Been Removed Because of Something. Only Because He Was a Road Service Personnel and His Qualifications Were Very Good (Graduated From St. John's University, Tsinghua School, Princeton University in the United States, Department of Diplomacy, Harvard University Railway Management Department, Former Director of the Tsinghua Economic Department, Nankai Professor, Secretary of the Zhili Foreign Affairs Department, Deputy Section Chief of the Former Ministry of Communications, Section Chief of the Beining Railway, Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Communications in Canada, Practical Car Transport and Sales Management of the Kantai Railway, Investigating Railway Affairs in Europe and the United States, the Beining Railway Office, Tangshan Car Section Chief Tongliao Car Section Chief, he immediately met with him to talk. As a result, Gu felt that Feng was very capable and was very familiar with car affairs. However, at that time, Feng asked for a reinstatement, because he did not know the truth, he promised to find out the truth and then handle it. After inquiring from various sources, he said that although Feng Jiantong was suspected of evading and retreating at that time, the punishment of never being re-appointed was also unfair. At the same time, Gao Jiyi, Director of the Beining Bureau, wrote to Gu again, reiterating his previous request. After consulting and investigating the results, Gu felt that Feng Jiantong's crime should be punished, but he was truly capable, and the letter from Lao, Deputy Director of Beining, praised his serious work and not avoiding hard work, and Gao, Director of Railway Bureau, also strongly recommended him in his letter, so he immediately approved the reinstatement and sent him to the Daoqing Railway to serve as the director of the Car Affairs Office. This is because the scope of the Daoqing Road is smaller, and there is also a need to reorganize the car affairs. Later, the Ministry of Railways felt that the urgency of reorganizing the Xiang-E Section of the Guangdong-Han Railway was more important than that of Daoqing, so Feng Jiantong was transferred to the position of Director of the Car Affairs Office of that road. It was both a sin to encourage merit, and a test of his ability to deal with deep-rooted problems. As for whether Feng Jiantong is Gu's subordinate, according to Gu, I don't know him, and he has no contact with Feng Jiantong so far except for official business.</p>

<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Guo Xingming Comes to Yong Repeatedly Trying to Commit Suicide: Guo Xingming is the nephew of Guo Songling, a former Northeast general, and the son of Guo Dejiang, a Northeast military division commander. He is currently 33 years old and graduated from Feng Yong University. He studied in Japan and is skilled in sports and literature. He lives in Yingkou and has two sons. Due to discord with his stepmother, he left home and worked as a secretary in the Liaoning Provincial Government. During the September 18th Incident last year, over 20 members of his family were brutally murdered by the Japanese army. After receiving a telegram from relatives and friends informing him of the tragedy, he wept bitterly and secretly returned to his hometown. Around June of this year, he personally killed three people who were responsible for his father's death. Later, he went from Tianjin to Nanjing, and then from Nanjing to Shanghai, intending to borrow travel expenses from friends to return to the Northeast to gather his father's old troops and resist the Japanese army. Unexpectedly, after arriving in Shanghai, he was unable to find his friends and his aspirations could not be realized. He became disheartened and attempted suicide by jumping into the Huangpu River but was rescued by the police. On the 1st of this month, he boarded the Hongxing wheel steamer to Ningbo. When the ship reached outside Wusongkou, he immediately jumped into the sea but was stopped by fellow passengers. On the morning of the 2nd, he arrived in Ningbo and walked to Xinjiang Bridge, intending to jump into the river, but was held by a service policeman on the bridge and sent to the Fourth Branch of the Public Security Bureau. The bureau gave him four small silver coins. After leaving the bureau, at 1:20 PM, he arrived at the train station and, seeing a train entering the station in Kongpu, jumped onto the tracks. Yao, the deputy stationmaster, risked his life to pull Guo out, saving him from death. Later, after repeated inquiries about the reason for his suicide, Guo revealed the truth. Everyone who heard it was saddened and advised him not to take his life lightly as his deep hatred had not been avenged. Someone also gave him ten dollars to use as travel expenses. Guo then took the 4 o'clock night train to Baiguan, intending to transfer to Hangzhou to visit friends and then go to Yunnan to borrow funds from Chairman Yunlong to gather his father's old troops in Heilongjiang Province and continue his anti-Japanese aspirations.</p>

He is scheduled to summon both parties for a confrontation within days to take legal action.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>Dear Sir, I recently read in the local correspondence column of your newspaper on August 1st a report of a robbery case in Taicang that also involved our shop in Yuewang City, which belongs to your county. I am deeply surprised. Upon investigation, our shop has not been robbed at all, nor has there been any robbery in our entire town. The report is completely untrue. I do not know what the correspondent based his report on. I am truly afraid of misleading the public and therefore send this letter to request a correction to clarify the truth. I am most grateful. Respectfully, Zhen Yi, Yue Wang City, Taicang County, General Merchandise Store</p>

<h3>Hot Soup</h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>In this hot weather, street corners are full of people selling cold drinks like ice cream and sour plum juice, but the newspaper is prominently featuring the words "hot soup".</p>
<p>"Hot soup" is the abbreviation of Tang Yulin of Jehol. Since the Northeast was lost without resistance, losing much of our beautiful land, it felt as if a bucket of cold water had been poured on the people's heads, chilling their entire bodies! Now, hot soup is advocating resistance, it is like giving the chilled people a cup of piping hot ginger juice, making them enthusiastically do the work of resisting the enemy! Hot soup! Hot soup! This is truly hot soup in name and in reality!</p>
<p>Some people suspect hot soup, saying that his previous attitude was not clear, as if he were mixed with that imported general's soup, becoming a mixed soup. However, strong grass is known in a gale, and loyal ministers are recognized in troubled times. In this urgent time for Jehol, hot soup published a grand declaration, if he can be true to his words, the Jehol region will not be difficult to defend like a city of gold! Hot soup! Hot soup! I regard you as the life-saving soup for 400 million people! Finally, not forgetting the regulations, I present you with an inscription for Tang's basin:</p>
<p>Hot soup, do not forget!</p>
<p>Never change your hot soup!</p>
<p>Don't let the heat turn into cold air,</p>
<p>Turning into cold drinks like ice cream and sour plum juice!</p>
<p>If your soup becomes cold,</p>
<p>It will chill the blood and hearts of 400 million people!</p>
<p>Hot soup, do not forget!</p>
<h3>Magistrate Yan</h3>
<p>— Wang Yiwu</p>
<p>We, the noble descendants of Yan and Huang, are not all greedy for life and afraid of death, unpatriotic, and lacking integrity. Historically, when China fell to the Yuan and Qing dynasties, there were countless people who defended their territory alone and served their country loyally. It is just a pity that those in high positions with military power were mostly greedy for life, afraid of death, unpatriotic, and lacking integrity! When the big shots cling to survive, only those in lower positions without real power remain, determined not to yield, which naturally does not help matters... At most, they can hold out for a few dozen days, delaying the change of color in that area a little... but it only harms the people, causing a great bloodshed... For example, during the late Ming Dynasty when Prince Fu was living in comfort in Jinling, treacherous officials were in power and did not prioritize the country, so even with Minister Shi, he could not single-handedly save the situation! Otherwise, Emperor Yuan of Jin and Emperor Gaozong of Song were still able to continue the lineage, extending it for a hundred years, so why couldn't Prince Fu? At that time, there were really not many people with integrity among those in high positions in Jinling! Only Magistrate Yan of Jiangyin, loyal to the Ming Dynasty, vowed not to surrender to the Manchus, and rallied three thousand people to defend the city together. Initially, because the Qing army did not take it seriously, they only sent a small number of troops to attack, and were repelled by Yan. Later, the Qing army mobilized a large force, and Yan was unable to resist, so he defended the city firmly. The Qing army besieged it urgently. Magistrate Yan, trapped inside the city, with no food or reinforcements,勉强守了七十天, finally the city was captured by the Qing army, and Yan and three thousand others died for their country! Before dying, he wrote a couplet: (For seventy days, I faithfully served with my hair intact, representing the sixteen reigns of Emperor Taizu; three thousand people went to righteousness with one heart, preserving one hundred li of Jiangshan for the Great Ming!) If the little court in Jinling could also be of one heart and die for righteousness, then what would there be to fear from the Qing army? The current three northeastern provinces are just the same! Those officials who bear the responsibility of defending the territory, with hundreds of thousands of armored soldiers, actually do not resist, while the volunteer army rises and falls endlessly. Everywhere there are people like Magistrate Yan, doing the work of (preserving one hundred li of Jiangshan for the Great Ming). But in the end, who does not meet the same fate as Magistrate Yan, only shedding blood in vain! If the responsible officials could realize this at this moment, and be willing to use force to recover the three eastern provinces, then these Magistrate Yans would be of great use and would not shed blood in vain. However, the responsible officials are unwilling to do so, so how can the Magistrate Yans be able to (preserve one hundred li of Jiangshan for the Great Ming)? But even so, although those in power do not resist, there must still be Magistrate Yans, fully demonstrating that the noble descendants of Yan and Huang are not all greedy for life and afraid of death, unpatriotic, and lacking integrity!</p>
<h3>Life of Soviet Students Studying in America</h3>
<p>— Zhou Cailiang</p>
<p>My friend Mr. Hu. He studied in the United States for many years. Recently, upon completing his studies, he told me a very interesting story about the life of Soviet students studying in America. I think his story can serve as a lesson for our country's authorities. Therefore, I record it as follows.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan, which shocked the world, has initially been successful. This is because, while it is nominally about economic recovery, it is actually a preparation for chemical warfare. Recently, the situation in the Far East has become increasingly tense. And the country's industrial production is also making rapid progress. Last month, the government, realizing that there was an undersupply of engineering talent, selected more than eighty young students to send to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States. The students were assigned to specialize in engineering. However, the U.S. government was quite apprehensive about the sudden influx of a large number of communists. For the sake of maintaining diplomatic relations, it was difficult to refuse. As a result, a portion of the school's dormitories was designated as a place for these people to live. All activities, including studying, practicing, playing, eating, and sleeping, were not allowed to cross the line. Moreover, the person in charge was ordered to prohibit contact with American students. Violations would be severely punished. The strictness of the precautions against communism can be said to be extremely painstaking. But the Soviet students acted as if nothing had happened. They continued to devote themselves to the study of industry, working diligently day and night. Even their clothes and food were extremely simple. Therefore, when our country's students in the United States talk about this, almost all of them consider it a strange thing.</p>
<h3>Talk of Money</h3>
<p>— Juemin</p>
<p>Recently, I have been troubled by the demon of money. I occasionally recall several stories about money. I record them for conversation material and to advise myself and others. In the past, there was a fundraiser who went to see John Murray, a wealthy British merchant. At that time, Murray was writing with two candles lit high. Seeing the guest enter, he quickly extinguished one of them. The fundraiser thought that this trip would be fruitless. However, after presenting his case, Murray generously donated a hundred gold coins. Surprised, the fundraiser asked him the reason. Murray said, "What you did is beyond my expectations. May I ask the reason?" Murray said, "Writing requires two candles. Talking only requires one. This is why I have surplus funds to donate to charity."</p>
<p>A wealthy American once recounted his experience, saying, "At the beginning of my business success, my wife suggested placing a sofa in the living room. Who knew that this one wrong thought would cost 30,000 dollars? Once a luxurious sofa was placed in the room, it was felt that the other chairs and stools were not worthy of it. New ones had to be replaced. Then, all the cabinets, tables, desks, and carpets had to be matched one by one. By the time all the utensils were new, it was felt that the house was narrow and crude. It had to be rebuilt. The total cost before and after reached 30,000 dollars. And I was in trouble."</p>
<p>Napoleon was the most diligent in handling affairs throughout his life. He got up every day at dawn. One day, he entered the office and heard the singing of a young clerk. He was surprised by his early hour. He praised his diligence and asked how much his salary was. The clerk replied, "One thousand two hundred gold coins a year." Napoleon said, "At your age, to receive such a generous salary, no wonder you are singing." The clerk said, "Alas, that is certainly the case. It is a pity that I cannot enjoy it. I have an elderly father and a weak younger sister who both depend on me for a living. Moreover, creditors often come to make things difficult for me, so I am quite sad." Napoleon realized that the reason why the young man got up early was that he could not sleep all night and used public affairs to relieve his boredom. Even the singing in his mouth was for this reason. He pitied him and gave him two thousand gold coins, warning him that if he incurred another debt, he would be dismissed without leniency.</p>
<h3>National Loan Factories Worth Introducing (17)</h3>
<p>— He Gongxing</p>
<p>(2) (8) Round Nail Factory</p>
<p>There are seven factories in Shanghai manufacturing round nails that are opened by Chinese people. There are two factories opened by foreigners. Jiafu, Fengji Wharf, Nanshi; Rongmao, Baokang Li, North Zhejiang Road; Gongqin, Linqing Road, Yangshupu; China, Yangshupu; Huafu, Qiqihar Road; Canghai, Taopeng Road; Yixing, Kunming Road; the above are opened by Chinese people; Meile, Peng Road; Qimei, Yangshupu; the above are one American and one British merchant.</p>
<p>Round nails are commonly known as foreign nails. Their use is very important. In the past, they were all imported goods. Occasionally, factories were set up to manufacture them themselves, but none of them succeeded. It was not until the years of the Republic of China 17 and 18 that domestic goods were finally successful. Now the Gongqin Nail Factory can produce 15,000 buckets per month. Jiafu's business is also not bad, because they are all cheap and of good quality, better than imported goods. They are bought by the bucket. Each bucket weighs one hundred pounds. The market price is about six taels. Generally speaking, the sale of nails depends on the size of the nails. The smaller they are, the more expensive they are. If the price of the standard price is six taels, then the smaller the price increases. The opposite is true for large nails. The smallest is two fen long. The largest is seven inches long. Sales in this and other cities are average. The seven factories listed above have annual sales of about three million taels of silver. Currently, except for some British and Belgian goods that are imported, Japanese goods have not been imported for three or four years. The raw material for making nails is iron wire from number 5 to number 16. The market price is more than one hundred taels per ton. They are British, German and Belgian goods. The nail making machine is commonly known as a nail making car. The styles and sizes are very different. They were originally bought from various countries. The small ones cost more than a thousand taels of silver per unit. The large ones cost three times as much. A disc car is placed next to the machine. The iron wire is placed on the disc. One end of the iron wire is inserted into the machine. After the work of a machine, it becomes a round, flat-headed nail. A large nail can produce 20 buckets every eight hours of work. A small nail only produces two buckets.</p>
<h3>Remembering a Summer Retreat in the Dan Yuan</h3>
<p>— Shen Ruyuan</p>
<p>Yongjia was known in the past as a place of mountains and waters. Yandang Mountain stands astride it, and its scenery is the best in Southeast China. Everyone who has ever traveled there praises it. I have heard of it often, but I regret that I have not been able to experience it myself. This spring, the Japanese pirates invaded Shanghai, and Master Ma Shirong took his family back to Yongjia to avoid the chaos. I was troubled by living in the Shanghai concession, so I went to Yongjia in early summer to pay my respects, hoping to fulfill my desire to visit. At that time, Master Meng lived in the Dan Yuan in the north of the city. The garden was newly built by his respected father, Taolaoshi Jukui. The Taolaoshi returned from politics and cultivated his garden and amused himself with the qin and books. In the garden, various beautiful trees and strange flowers were planted. There were many evergreen trees, which flourished in spring and summer and did not wither in autumn and winter. Living in the midst of prosperity and tranquility, the intention was very good. Ting Song Ge in the garden was divided into three rooms. The middle room was the Taolaoshi's qin room, and several ancient qins were hung. The left room was Master Meng's study, and dozens of paintings and calligraphy by famous ancient and modern artists were hung on the walls. The right room was a library, with a rich collection of books. The pavilion faced the river and backed against the city wall. An isolated island was in front of it, and Guo Mountain pillowed its right. The scenery was secluded and beautiful. A small pond was dug beside it, with red carp in it. Weeping willows were planted around it. Birdsong could be heard from time to time. Even when the sun was burning overhead, the breeze was gentle. There was almost no heat in the pavilion. The Taolaoshi liked to burn incense and sit quietly, writing books and playing the qin to pass the time. In recent years, he has written dozens of volumes of Chun Hui Tang Qin Pu, Qin Ming Ji, Qin Xue Cong Tan, and Li Dai Yong Qin Shi Xuan. Master Meng was even more diligent. He read books, painted, and wrote poetry every morning to study on his own. In the afternoon, he taught people like me, tirelessly. Master Meng's attainments in painting theory and painting method were extremely profound. He was able to go deep and bring out the shallow, developing what previous people had not developed. Scholars, once instructed, felt that their progress was immeasurable. After Master Meng finished his classes and reading, he often devoted himself to writing, planning to compile and publish several kinds of painting theory, painting method, and painting scores to share with those who love it. (It is said that the Flower and Bird Score, Calligraphy, Painting, Gold and Stone Collection has been reprinted several times. The new Flower, Bird, Grass and Insect Score will also be published soon.) For more than 300 years, the Ma family has passed down the qin, books, poetry, painting, gold, and stone. From Jieyuan Weixia, Bacui Xiangxia, Laisheng Mingjing, to Jukui's literature, all have a reputation in the art world. It has become even more grand with Master Meng and Uncle Gongyu. The origin of family learning has become a family style. Master Meng was pure and honest, but he always spoke out with justice and anger. This time, the violent sun invaded and humiliated us, and he often entrusted poems to express his feelings. Whenever I wanted to create anti-Japanese texts or pictures, I would ask Master Meng for instructions. The master patiently explained them in detail, and I sighed even more at his keen sense of the times and his love for the country. Master Meng is now responding to the invitation of the China Academy of Arts and Sciences, and is jointly preparing for an art exhibition with Huang Binhong, Liu Haisu, Wang Jiyuan, Ma Gongyu and others. He will return to Shanghai soon. I am afraid that I will not be able to stay long, so I record it with a pen to commemorate the traces of my visit.</p>
<p>Giving Away a Collection of National Crisis Speeches: The Jiangsu National Crisis Relief Association has recently published a series of National Crisis Small Books, which is a complete collection of speeches on the national crisis by Mr. Ma Xiangbo, a ninety-three-year-old man. It is divided into two parts, A and B, with tens of thousands of words, all of which are famous and truthful arguments. The old man advocates the implementation of democracy and the promotion of constitutionalism. In this time of national crisis, the people of the country should each have a copy to be the foundation for saving the country. This book is now being given away by the association at Huanlong Road in Shanghai. Letters will be sent immediately upon request.</p>
<h3>Recording of Bell Ringing at an Ancient Temple (65)</h3>
<p>— Bu Chu Ting Cao Qi Fu</p>
<p>62</p>
<p>I said... (The Industrial Studies Group can disappear without a trace, I have the confidence that it can. But if it flies into a traditional school, it is inevitable that someone will catch it and put it in a cage, or have malicious intentions and shoot it down, killing it may not be known.) Mr. Zhu said... (We certainly have to consider this. The unfortunate things you said sometimes happen. But we must not be discouraged because of things that may or may not happen. The spread of this Industrial Studies Group probably comes in two ways... one is natural spread, and the other is forced spread. Natural spread relies on the change of individual attitude. If someone now asks you to run a school, or open a factory, or manage a prison, or lead an army, how would you prepare to do it?) I said... (I will undoubtedly turn it into an Industrial Studies Group.) (Did you have this belief a month ago?) (No.) (Then your personal attitude change is only the result of a month. Since you can change your attitude in a month, some people are changing as fast as you are, my age is older than you, so the change will come slower, but my change in educational views is only a matter of three to five years. People will change. Traditional teachers will become revolutionary teachers. Don't think that because you are a reformist, others are all conservatives. You can't think that because a person is conservative now, they will always be conservative. Who wants to take the path to death? There are only two kinds of people who take the path to death... one is like a mouse crawling into a cow horn tube, not knowing that the road they are taking is a dead end... the other is like a ship on fire rushing to jump into the water, thinking that burning to death is more terrible than drowning. If you can really point out that the cow horn tube is a dead end, and really throw down a life-saving ring, who would insist on their own opinions and seek death? If we prove in action and in fact that the Industrial Studies Group is the life-saving ring of the Chinese nation, and the traditional school is the dead end of the Chinese nation, who would still want to run a traditional school? Who would not want to turn a traditional school into a meaningful Industrial Studies Group? A school's teachers and students who have this awareness is the success of an Industrial Studies Group... a factory's staff and workers who have this awareness is also the success of an Industrial Studies Group... a prison's warden and prisoners who have this awareness is also the success of an Industrial Studies Group... an army's officers and soldiers who have this awareness is also the success of an Industrial Studies Group. This matter is extremely simple and easy. As long as each group of people are willing to work, willing to grow, unwilling to step on other people's heads and unwilling to let other people's feet step on their own heads, then they will succeed. The Industrial Studies Group will naturally succeed.</p>

<h3>Finance The Gold Market Is Listless</h3>
<p>The Trend is Mediocre: Yesterday's gold market fluctuated, seeming mediocre. The total range for the day was only four taels. In the end, it fell by one tael and three qian. All parties had deposits and withdrawals, but there were no large amounts. People's hearts were uncertain. It fell as soon as it opened. Although the silver market fell, it was ineffective. In fact, exchange rates did not move. The effect of the rise in forward silver prices, coupled with the continued short covering by the Guangdong banks, caused the gold price to rebound as the foreign exchange stabilized. There were slight advances and retreats in between. The market felt particularly dull. The price hovered around forty-four taels, especially because the weather was hot and there were few people in the market. The conditions of the front and back markets are recorded below:</p>
<p>The Opening Dropped Two Taels and Four Qian: As soon as the market opened in early September, it dropped by two taels and four qian, totaling 742 taels and four qian. Large bars of silver fell by one-sixteenth, and the price of silver shrank by one-eighth. Private telegrams only showed a small one-sixteenth. However, forward silver prices unexpectedly rose, so the opening was low (however, the unofficial market outside the market shouted that it encountered forty-four taels and five taels and immediately went downstream because there were many sellers). Then, Yuanxing Yong and others came to advance, immediately reaching forty-three taels. Fuyu Hengxing sold out, immediately pressing down more than one tael, to forty-one taels and five qian. That was when the August British gold was first bought by the bank for 4375, followed by a halfpenny. After Hengxing suddenly came to pull in, and Hengyu Hengxing Yuan Yifeng Zhifeng Yong and others all followed, and Macari absorbed 625 British gold in November, and Hua Bi absorbed 0.0625 US gold in September, so the price rose more than two taels, to forty-four taels and two qian. At 9:30, HSBC listed British at par, and US shrank 0.125, while internally it was at par, at three taels and eight qian. Soon after, Hengxing Yuanda Yong Hengyu Hong Kang Yong Fu Tai Xiang all advanced, close to ten o'clock at forty-four taels and seven qian. Yuantai Hengyu Zhifeng Yong Hengxing Yuan all sold, immediately falling more than one tael, to forty-three taels and three qian. Afterwards, Dadecheng Yifeng Yong Zhifeng Yong Hengxing and others still bought, and the bank absorbed 0.3125 US dollars in November. People's hearts were shaken, raising it by two taels, until 11:30 at forty-five taels and five qian. Before long, it was heard that the banks sold out in November, and everyone sold out, falling more than two taels, to forty-three taels and two qian at 11:45. At that time, there were five qian up and down. Suddenly, Yuanxing Yong came to advance two or three hundred bars, immediately pulling up seven or eight qian until the afternoon close at forty-four taels.</p>
<p>The Afternoon Market Was Extremely Desolate: The afternoon market opened at forty-four taels. Dalian Gang Shunli slightly sold out, immediately falling to forty-three taels and a half. The banks traded halfpennies of British gold in October with each other. Then Shanghai absorbed 0.3125 US dollars in November. Hengxing bought more than one hundred bars. At 2:40, it was forty-four taels and one qian. Dadecheng and others sold out, especially Shanghai sold 30 US dollars in September, immediately wiping out six or seven qian. At 3 o'clock, it was forty-three taels and four qian. HSBC absorbed 0.0625 British gold in September, and Zhifeng Yong and retail investors bought in, continuing to see forty-four taels and one qian. After 3:30, the afternoon market was mediocre, with few deposits and withdrawals, only two or three qian of circulation. At 4 o'clock closing, it was forty-three taels and a half, a decrease of one tael and three qian compared to the morning. According to the largest five taels and five qian in one day, the smallest one tael and five qian, there is a four tael difference. Bare gold still added eight taels and a half.</p>
<p>The Price Was Mostly Suppressed by Four Taels: The listed price was changed to 817 taels. Because the US dollar shrank by 0.125, the estimated discount was 73 or 74 taels, and later 71 taels. At noon, it was still 74 taels. In the afternoon, it was 73 or 74 taels, which was four taels more than the previous day. The registered price was forty-four taels, and the water was forty-two taels. The same in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Inconsistent Inflows and Outflows: On the trading floor, the transactions were different. According to statistics, Guangbang 𠈗xing bought more than 800 bars (covering shorts) and sold more than 100 bars. Yifeng bought more than 300 bars. The Dalian Gang's inflows and outflows totaled about three or four hundred bars, breaking even. Yuanda Yong Hengxing Yuan Fudaheng Yongfeng Yuanxing Yong Yifeng Yong Hongkang Yong all had more inflows than outflows. Tong Taichang's inflows and outflows were more than 500 bars,軋 out more than 100 bars. Yuanmao Yong Zhifeng Yong Yuantai Tongchun Hengchang Yong Yuanchun had inflows and outflows from time to time. In the afternoon, Zhifeng Yong Hengxing Yuantai slightly advanced. Yuanmao Yong Shunli Dadecheng and others all sold out. The rest were scattered, with the total number of bars in various numbers estimated to be around 22,000.</p>

<h3>No Change in London Silver Market</h3>

<h3>Overnight Loan Market Lacks Vitality</h3>
<p>A sign of the market's stagnation: recently, there has been a clamor to abolish the tael, and as the implementation date is not far off, the silver and dollar markets in Shanghai both show a pessimistic mood about losing their status, deeply feeling a lack of vitality. Those engaged in this business are generally in a state of stagnation, not knowing how to innovate, so they will fail to plan ahead and not dig a well when thirsty, ultimately unable to salvage the situation and listening to their fate. Therefore, the overnight loan rate is now in a state of confusion, like a sick person, with no spirit to revive, which is truly regrettable.</p>
<p>Overnight rates unchanged, silver discount slightly higher (Dollar overnight) The overnight rate in the morning was the same as the previous morning, at 6 mace, 8 fen, and 5 li. The afternoon market was slightly better by 0.25 hao, at 6 mace, 8 fen, 8 li, and 2.5 hao. The result was slightly better than the previous day's afternoon market by 0.125 hao. (Silver Discount) The morning rate was 1 mace and 1 fen, slightly higher than the previous day by 2 fen. The afternoon rate was the same. Adding water to the discount seemed to make it a few fen better, calculated at 1 mace. The bank's listed rate was 4 fen.</p>
<p>Jiangnan Small Coins Fall Slightly, Copper Coins Decrease by 1,500. Jiangnan small silver dollars fell sharply by 0.4 li in the morning because some people sold them, and the buyers were sluggish, calculated at 6 mace and 2 li. Transactions were even quieter in the afternoon market, so the price did not rise or fall, remaining at 6 mace and 2 li. The morning transaction volume was 3,000 jiao, and the afternoon volume was 1,000 jiao. Guangdong small silver dollars were the same in the morning and afternoon, at 15 mace, 8 fen, 4 li and a half, which was also the same as the previous day's morning. The morning transaction volume was 95,000 jiao, and the afternoon volume was 15,000 jiao. Copper coins decreased by 1,500 cash, to 429,000 cash. The transaction price was 11,500 taels of silver, equivalent to 49,335 strings of cash.</p>
<p>The transaction of Foreign Exchange was very calm. The morning market for exchange bills was very quiet, with only 485,000 yuan. The afternoon market was even smaller, with only 330,000 yuan. In the note market, the morning volume was 15,000 yuan, and the afternoon volume was 40,000 yuan. Outside the market, the morning volume was 70,000 yuan, and the afternoon volume was 50,000 yuan. Check transactions were only 30,000 yuan in the morning, increasing by 0.1875 yuan.

Foreign mortgage transactions totaled over 900,000 yuan. Foreign exchange loans in and out totaled over 1.8 million yuan. Customer remittances totaled over 100,000 yuan. Small money shop transactions totaled 4-500,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Silver Collection and Disbursement is lax due to Business Decline. Various banks have regular collections and disbursements, but yesterday's market was very lax, mainly due to the sluggishness of commerce and the stagnation of demand. Foreign banks collected and disbursed over 1.1 million yuan in bills and over 4 million yuan in various merchandise exchange and miscellaneous items. Mortgage transactions totaled over 700,000 yuan, and warehouse entries totaled 600,000 yuan. Chinese banks collected and disbursed over 1.9 million yuan in bills and over 6 million yuan in various merchandise exchange, tax and miscellaneous items. Mortgage transactions totaled over 100,000 yuan, and warehouse entries totaled 500,000 yuan. The money shops' bill exchange transactions totaled over 6 million yuan in the morning and afternoon.

<h3>Securities: Bond Prices Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>But the trend is sluggish and the changes are minimal.</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 4th), the market situation of various bonds in the Chinese Securities Exchange was that although there were many types of spot trading, the market was still quiet, and the total volume of bond transactions was only 20,000 yuan. The futures market also continued to lack vitality. Among them, only the September futures of the 1920 Customs Surtax had 5,000 yuan each, and the others had no market. Statistics show that 2,295,000 yuan was opened in the two morning sessions, of which the salt tax accounted for 630,000 yuan, and the rest was around 200,000 yuan. The entire 1926 Customs Surtax was only tens of thousands of yuan each, and the 1926 Financial Bonds had no market. Regarding the changes in the prices of various bonds, the market demand was relatively strong at the beginning of the morning session, and people's minds were stable, and the prices all continued to rise compared with the previous day. However, as soon as the prices opened, they rose, and at that time, the supply and demand were extremely flat, and the prices were all in a sluggish state. As a result, the spot price of the entire 1926 Customs Surtax rose by 1.70 yuan compared to the previous day, and the spot price of the 1920 Consolidated Loan also rose by 1.30 yuan. Other prices rose by several jiao to eight or nine jiao. Judging from the situation of the bond market, it is temporarily gradually entering a state of stability.</p>

<h3>Amazing Development in New York Stock Market</h3>
<p>(Report from American Eastern Bank)</p>
<p>Wednesday, the New York stock market had an amazing development. The market prices of all stocks rose sharply. Four or five stocks have exceeded the highest records of this year. The buying and selling was brisk throughout the day, with a turnover of 2.42 million shares. General Motors and United Pharmaceuticals both issued dividends as usual. However, the news of its development was after the market closed. There was also gratifying news on that day that was sufficient to affect the stock market's morale, that is, the American Financial Corporation felt the need to revitalize the railway industry and decided to purchase railway materials in large quantities. If this plan is implemented, the status of the steel industry will be greatly improved. The market prices of goods were also good on that day. According to past experience, if the prices of goods are stable or tend to rise, the merchants' fearful psychology can be eliminated, and manufacturers and sellers will increase their activities at the same time. However, generally speaking, the rise in the stock market during the day is not so much due to the actual progress of industry and commerce, but rather to the shift in people's minds. The Dow Jones index is attached as follows:</p>
<p>| Date       | August 2 | August 3 | Change  |</p>
<p>|------------|----------|----------|---------|</p>
<p>| 30 Industrials | 53.16    | 58.23    | Up 5.07 |</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Market in Indecisive Fluctuations</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon, with a tight trend in the softness. People's minds were quite uncertain, rising and falling suddenly, making people fall into a fog. However, most people are pessimistic, because the spot demand is not smooth, and the war clouds in the Northeast are strong, so they tend to go short. As for the buyers, because the bottom goods are too dry and the situation of foreign yarn is still stable, both the long and short sides have considerable ideas, so the dispute is very fierce. What will happen in the future still depends on the actual needs as the biggest key. At present, it is probably still in the brewing period.</p>
<h3>Man-Mark Rises in the Morning and Falls in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>The opening of the Man-Mark forward market was tight due to the rise in American cotton. Short sellers in the market covered their positions, and the prices of each month rose by 7, 8, and 9 qian to 1 tael. In the afternoon, the market suddenly turned down, and it was rumored that Tianjin yarn was mixed in Shanghai. The prices of each month fell by 5, 6, 7, and 8 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 25,150 bales. It was found that Yichang sold 1,100 bales, Yuanda sold 700 bales, Ruidar sold 2,400 bales, and Yuda sold 650 bales. Suilong bought 950 bales, Jifeng bought 800 bales, Hengyi bought 700 bales, and Shenji bought 700 bales. Changfeng bought 650 bales. The closing prices are listed as follows:</p>
<p>| Man-Mark Closing Price | Increase/Decrease | Open Interest |</p>
<p>|----------------------|--------------------|---------------|</p>
<p>| November 1466        | Up 225              | 2,132,850      |</p>
<p>| August 1484          | Up 339             | 350            |</p>
<p>| December 1466        | Up 2128            | 2,128,150      |</p>
<p>| September 1474       | Up 1                | 76,200        |</p>
<p>| January 1465         |                | 362,850     |</p>
<p>| October 1468         |                | 2,145,500     |</p>
<p>| Total                |                    | 553,950      |</p>
<h3>Spot Demand is Sluggish</h3>
<p>The sales of spot yarn are relatively sluggish. It was found that the total amount of yarn bought by various groups throughout the day was 400 bales. The market price was flat in the morning and fell by 0.25 yuan in the afternoon. The amount bought by each party is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Changsha 60 Luzhou 35 Inland 60 Sichuan 75 Yunnan 80 Guangdong 40 Ningbo 5 Jiangxi 5 Fellow Traders 70 Total 400 bales</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Tends to Advance</h3>
<p>The cotton market turned up because American cotton rose, and Wall Street's financial stocks rose sharply, causing people's minds to tighten, and short sellers covered their positions. However, most people's minds are still selling short, and the pressure is still heavy. It is rumored that Tianjin coarse velvet is still coming to Shanghai in large quantities, so the short sellers' minds have not changed. However, the American cotton market is strong, and the bottom goods of this cotton are too dry. Judging from the situation in Shanghai, it is not easy to change for a while without special forces. At present, I am afraid that it will hover between one or two points.</p>
<h3>Zheng Mark has short covering</h3>
<p>The market atmosphere was slightly firm at the opening of the futures market. Buyers were more active in the second and third sessions, and the prices of each month rose by 2-3 qian. In the afternoon, the market weakened slightly due to the decline in the yarn market, and the prices of each month fell by 5 fen. The total transaction volume for the day was 41,100 dan. It was found that Changhe sold 2,400 dan, Yuanda sold 2,700 dan, Changfeng sold 2,400 dan, Ruidar sold 1,200 dan, Xiesheng sold 1,100 dan, and Jifeng sold 1,400 dan. Suilong bought 2,100 dan, Yichang bought 1,400 dan, Mingde bought 1,900 dan, Heshen bought 1,200 dan, Changhe bought 2,100 dan, and Lichang bought 1,000 dan. The closing prices are listed as follows:</p>

<h3>Raw Cotton sales turn brisk</h3>
<p>Spot Cotton consumption is active again, and Japanese factories are also purchasing, because the American cotton has turned for the better and the factory demand is developing.

Also, transactions were made at the warehouse.</p>
<h3>American Cotton Rises Back, British and Indian Cotton Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was weak at first due to poor news from Liverpool, but it was strong due to foreign merchants buying in and strong Wall Street financial markets. The futures rose by 9 to 12 points, and the spot goods rose by 10 points. British cotton futures fell by 89 points, and spot goods fell by 7 points. Egyptian cotton spot goods fell by 10 points. Indian cotton was weak due to long profits and speculation, and both Pingguoer and Aomura fell by 3.5 rupees, and Bailuoxi fell by 4 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (3rd telegram): American Cotton Compared with the previous day, it conforms to the Shanghai regulations. British Cotton Compared with the previous day it conforms to the Shanghai regulations. 10 599 Up 10 26.80 10 441 Down 8 28.90 12 614 Up 10 27.50 12 446 Down 9 29.30 1 623 Up 10 27.90 1 449 Down 8 29.50 3 635 Up 9 28.50 3 455 Down 8 29.90 5 650 Up 2 29.20 5 461 Down 8 30.30 7 663 Up 1 29.80 Spot 461 Down 7 30.30 Spot 600 Up 10 26.90 Egyptian 700 10 45.70 Pingguoer 157.50 Down 3.50 24.00 Aomura 173.00 Down 3.50 26.30 Bailuoxi 177.25 Down 4.00 27.10</p>
<h3>Grains: Rice Market Rises and Falls Again</h3>
<p>Shanghai South Yesterday the weather turned sunny, and 20-30 ships arrived. Sales in urban and rural markets were sluggish, and the market tightened and fell again. The Beginning of Autumn Festival is approaching, and the market prices of various goods are falling by about 2 jiao. Thick japonica rice and early and late rice opened lower by 1-2 jiao. Foreign Dujian rice arrived and sold at the same price, with limited fluctuations. Although there was little arrival of glutinous rice, the sales were even more sluggish, and the situation was downstream. In addition, there was still accumulation in the Pujiang River, and foreign rice fell again, with no appetite, and the situation was difficult to improve.</p>
<p>Xinzha Yesterday, there were more than 20 sources in the west road, and the sales were initially sluggish and then brisk. Changxi North japonica rice was extremely sluggish in the morning, and the price continued to soften. The shop's intention to enter the market turned weak, and the top order was small at 0.2-0.3 yuan. Early thin rice also followed at a small angle. Yuan goods changed to rare and the price rose by 0.1 yuan. The arrival of new japonica rice was slightly less, and people's minds were depressed. The opening price stabilized. The daily load was about 2,000 stone.</p>
<h3>Tianjin and Ningbo Gangs Purchase Saigon Rice</h3>
<p>Ning-Shao Gang inquired about Tianjin Xiaojiao</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the foreign rice market, there was purchasing by the Tianjin and Ningbo gangs, and the market situation was very good. The unified market opened with more than 10,000 bags of various rice. The Tianjin gang purchased 3,000 bags of No. 1 Saigon rice, and the Ningbo gang purchased 5,000 bags of old and new Xiaojiao rice. Various households in the local inland also inquired slightly, but the cargo owners all had sales intentions. The hoarders did not want to store for a long time due to the hot weather, so although the digestion was good, the market price did not increase, but it felt active and the market price could stabilize. If there is a large amount of digestion, the market price can be turned around. A total of 3,000 bags of No. 1 Saigon rice were opened throughout the day, priced at 10.025 yuan to 10.01 yuan, and 7,000 bags of Xiaojiao rice, priced at 9.50 yuan to 9.375 yuan for new goods and 9.10 yuan to 9 yuan for old Xiaojiao. The price was slightly lower than the previous day by 0.1 yuan, but the goods were slightly inferior, and the market situation was similar to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Initially Rises and Then Falls</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the market situation of various months showed an initial rise and then a fall. Because the price of foreign wheat rebounded by about 0.5 yuan and 0.2-0.3 yuan, the people's minds were quite high at the beginning, and the near and far periods were better than the previous day by more than 0.1 yuan. However, since the second session, the market atmosphere took a sharp turn for the worse. It was heard that a boat of Australian wheat was indeed traded, handled by Xiangmao, including a cost of 4.2 yuan. Therefore, Fufeng sold very smoothly, and Fuxin also continued to sell a lot. The long positions of the Fuzhou gang also returned a large number of tickets, so the market atmosphere was very weak, and there was almost a tendency to re-enter 0.91 yuan. After watching the follow-up, I am afraid that it will not be easy to be optimistic if the actual sales are not smooth. As a result, this month was slightly lower than the previous day by 0.0125 yuan, September was lower by 0.02 yuan, October was lower by 0.0125 yuan, November was lower by 0.01 yuan, December was lower by 0.005 yuan, and January was better by 0.0025 yuan.</p>
<h3>There are many buyers in the wheat futures market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning, the market situation of various months showed a firm and stable trend. Because the price of foreign wheat rebounded by about 0.2-0.3 yuan and 0.5 yuan, the minds of people outside the industry naturally became firm, and the biggest reason was that the soaring price of wheat in the mainland has attracted the deep attention of the people. Therefore, they are tracking step by step, and the opening price is very expensive. For example, the price quoted in Gaoyou has reached 0.6 yuan to Shanghai, and Wuxi has opened to 6.3 yuan. Therefore, buyers are still smooth, and the price is difficult to fall. As a result, August rose by 0.3 yuan compared to the previous day, September rose by 0.3 yuan, October and November rose by 0.02 yuan, and December rose by 0.3 yuan. Since the spot wheat arrival and sales are both quiet, there is no market opening.</p>
<h3>The sugar market shows good business in raw and white sugar.</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Public Association market trade was lively in the sugar market. The transaction price for Dutch 24 raw white sugar was 14 taels and 6.5 qian, 14 taels for 18 medium white sugar, 10 taels and 4 qian for 8 Dutch red, and 12 taels and 7 qian for 14 raw red. The market also appears tight. The trends are all steady and elegant. The transactions of Taikoo sugar turned scarce at 16 taels and 4 qian, and the sales were very rare. HX Mark was at 15 taels and 3 qian, and HM Mark was at 14 taels and 8 qian, with slightly more transaction. The market was stable, and a Huaxin company was selling 1,312 bags of high-quality raw white sugar at a price of 14 taels and 6.5 qian. The company's interest in buying was very strong, so it was sold through instantly, and the market appeared quite elegant.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>European and American silk telegrams continue to be sent.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market in Shanghai Foreign Firms still lacked a trend of progress. Overseas futures and spot silk telegrams were not seen to be transferred to Shanghai yesterday, and Xinfu Dachang and others all had factory dry wire telegrams sent out yesterday. Both Chinese and foreign parties are waiting for the telegram to be transferred before proceeding. Yesterday, Lianna bought 15 packages of Grade B medium-grade raw white factory silk with 13 to 18 strands at a price of 490 taels, which was to take the opportunity to replenish the missing goods, not to actually start selling.</p>
<h3>The Road Firm Zhenmei Tea Trade is Prosperous</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the tea market of Shanghai Foreign Firms, the British firms Xietong, Yihuo, Jinlong, and Tianyu and other firms continued to spare no effort in searching for and buying Zhenmei green tea from the incoming Road firms. The city-wide transaction of various Road green teas totaled more than 3,600 boxes, and the market continued to become active. Among them, the market price of goods from Suian, Ping, and Kaihua and other Roads rose by 3-4 taels, and the rest also tended to be hard. However, in recent days, no British merchants have asked about Qining black tea, and Russian firms have also adopted a price suppression attitude, and the market is most sluggish.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Summer Woolen Cloth End-of-Season Sales Fall in Price</h3>
<p>France · Feather Yarn · Pale · Bette · White Drill · White Zhigong · Double Yarn Rubber Cloth · Zhuluo Yarn · Summer-season goods such as Wieleke, which are required for sales, are now in the sound of end-of-season sales, and those who hold the goods are willing to lower prices in order to sell them. However, buyers still have little intention of re-entering summer goods, resulting in a drop in the market price. Yesterday, Yongle Yellow Twill Wholesale price was only 4.5 qian per yard, double yarn rubber cloth was 3.15 qian, Good Times Hanping White Zhigong were all reduced to 3 taels and 6 qian, and ordinary old-fashioned mercerized striped feather yarn was uniformly cut to 1 tael and 5-6 qian. Pale and Bette are 0.1-0.2 yuan cheaper than 10 days ago. Wieleke Zhuluo Yarn is 0.03-0.05 yuan cheaper per yard on average.</p>
<h3>Hardware, British white iron increases in price but not much trading.</h3>
<p>English white iron has had the possibility of price hikes for some time due to the high cost and the weakness of the bottom goods. However, the spot goods of foreign firms have been sold and sold one after another, causing the standards to have an appearance that is strong on the outside and weak on the inside. Recently, most of the spot goods of foreign firms have been received and stored by wealthy financial firms, so the market image has become more and more stable. However, there has not been much progress in the actual transaction recently, because the estimated price has suddenly increased, and buyers are afraid to take action. Therefore, there have been no large transactions in recent days. Although there is a little embellishment in the market, it is only sporadic business from factories and construction gangs. The current market price is 48 sheets at 11 taels and 38 sheets at 11.5 taels. 33 sheets at 11 taels, 25 sheets at 10 taels and 7.5 qian, 21 sheets at 10 taels and 5 qian, and 60 sheets at 11.5 taels. According to a survey of the peers' benchmarks, there is still no profit to be made, then there will not be many goods arriving in the market in the future, people's minds will be consolidated, and the market will continue to look good.</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>China and Brazil will soon revise the treaty</h3>
<p>▲The Brazilian ambassador will travel south from Beiping soon.</p>
<p>▲The Brazilian Consul discusses various topics related to China and Brazil.</p>
<p>Central News Agency: The China-Brazil Treaty signed between China and Brazil on August 11 of the seventh year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty, namely October 3, 1881 in the Western calendar, has been more than 50 years old. The authorities of the two countries are now preparing to revise it. A reporter from the Central News Agency interviewed the Brazilian Consul General in Shanghai, Almerda, at the consulate yesterday. Mr. Almerda was out on business, and was received by Secretary Batalha, who described the various aspects of China and Brazil in great detail to the reporter. The record of his conversation is as follows:</p>
<p>▲Revision of the Treaty: The treaty signed between China and Brazil in 1881 has a total of 17 articles. The content of the treaty includes trade, shipping, taxation, and consular jurisdiction between the two countries. It has been more than 50 years since then, and it is necessary to revise it. Therefore, the governments of the two countries are now preparing to revise it. Our country's ambassador to China, Velloso, is now in Beiping and will travel south to Shanghai and Nanjing soon to meet with your country's Minister of Foreign Affairs to discuss the revision of the treaty. The relationship between China and Brazil has always been extremely cordial, and it is believed that the friendship between the two countries will be further enhanced after the treaty is revised.</p>
<p>▲China-Brazil Trade: There is very little direct trade between China and Brazil. Most of the Brazilian goods are transferred to China through Japan. Direct trade accounts for only 20%. The goods shipped from Brazil to China are mainly coffee, wood, seed oil, cigars, cigarettes, cotton, fruits, and bone meal. The goods shipped from China to Brazil are mainly yellow tobacco leaves, silk, lace, and antiques.</p>
<p>▲Situation of Overseas Chinese: There are approximately 100 Brazilian people living in China, of whom more than 80 live in Shanghai. There is no accurate survey of the number of Chinese living in Brazil, but about 50 years ago, there were about 1,000 Chinese living in Brazil. Since then, there have been very few entries. The relationship between the Chinese living in Brazil and the Brazilians is very good. There are about</p>
<h3>Advice to the Cotton Yarn Trade Association from Two Organizations</h3>
<p>Please Do Not Raise Domestic Cotton Yarn Prices</p>
<p>In Order to Avoid the Bad Reputation of Undermining the Boycott of Enemy Goods</p>
<p>▲Municipal Chamber of Commerce: Yesterday, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Cotton Yarn Trade Association, stating: "Regarding the letter received on the 3rd of this month from the United Association of National Goods Factories of this city, it stated that 'Due to the cotton yarn industry taking advantage of the current period of boycotting Japanese goods to deliberately manipulate the market and raise the prices of domestic goods, it is clearly acting with ulterior motives and should be stopped by all means.' This matter was submitted to our Executive Committee for detailed discussion, and it was unanimously agreed that such actions not only contain speculative intentions and violate commercial credit, but also undermine the anti-Japanese movement, no less than acting as an accomplice to the enemy. We fear that it is not only the cotton yarn industry that is acting in this way, and it is difficult to guarantee that other industries will not take similar actions. If strict measures are not taken to stop this, the harm will be immeasurable. It was resolved to send a letter to your association to persuade and encourage them to realize their error. If they persist in their wrongdoing, they should be given special sanctions to serve as a warning to others.' The matter has been recorded and submitted for your inspection and implementation. We sincerely hope for this, etc.' Upon investigation, we found that according to a letter from the cotton weaving industry, the cost of using domestic cotton yarn must be increased by 20% to 30%, which is exactly the same as the United Association's claim that the price of domestic goods has been raised. This method only gives those who use Japanese goods an excuse, and all parties will focus their accusations on the cotton yarn industry for undermining the boycott of enemy goods. Therefore, we earnestly advise you to persuade your members to sell domestic cotton yarn at fair prices to benefit manufacturers, which we sincerely hope for."</p>
<p>National Salvation Association: Yesterday, the Shanghai United Association of National Salvation Organizations sent a letter to the Cotton Yarn Trade Association, stating: "Regarding the letter received recently from the United Association of National Goods Factories, stating that 'Due to the cotton yarn industry taking advantage of the current period of boycotting Japanese goods to deliberately manipulate the market and raise the prices of domestic goods, it is clearly acting with ulterior motives and should be stopped by all means. Please investigate and implement this matter, etc.' Upon investigation, at a time when domestic goods should be selling well, why does the cotton yarn industry alone raise prices? If it is not acting with ulterior motives, then it is engaging in speculative behavior. If other industries follow suit, it will have a significant impact on the commercial market. The matter was resolved through a standing committee meeting. Considering that your association is the leading organization in the industry and has the authority to issue warnings, we hereby specially request your association to strictly warn the cotton yarn industry, etc., not to continue manipulating the market arbitrarily. Raising prices directly leads to the sluggish sales of domestic goods and indirectly promotes the speculative sale of inferior goods. In addition to replying to the National Goods Factories, the matter has been recorded and submitted for your inspection and implementation. We hope you will take note and implement this accordingly. Addressed to the Cotton Yarn Trade Association, Shanghai. Signed by Li Cishan, Yin Zhiling, Yu Kang, Liu Shixiong, and Tan Bozhi, Standing Directors of the Shanghai United Association of National Salvation Organizations."</p>
<h3>Boycott of Enemy Goods Movement in Various Industries</h3>
<p>Statement from the Coal and Stone Barge Industry: The Shanghai Coal and Stone Barge Trade Association received a warning yesterday from the "Red Blood Hoe Good Group," stating: "Recently, the situation in Rehe is critical. If you merchants are still deluded and unrepentant, please prepare for the aftermath for your children within a week. It is urgent! It is imperative! We hereby notify you in advance to avoid being caught unprepared." The association replied, stating: "We have received your warning and read it with deep admiration. It shows that your concern for the country is overflowing in your words. All member firms of our association are transporting coal and stone for customers. Since the September 18th Incident, we have organized inspection teams to work at various wharves, prohibiting the transportation of enemy coal. We are acting in accordance with the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association. Although there are one or two merchants who have undermined this, they have been severely punished, as records can prove. The members of our association believe that they have not dared to lag behind others in loving the country. We are willing to stand on the same front as patriotic people, swear to fight the enemy to the end, and jointly save the country from danger. In addition to warning all members again, we are using the newspapers to express our humble intentions. We hope that compatriots across the country will understand this."</p>
<p>▲Meeting of the Jewelry Industry: The Shanghai Jewelry Trade Association, due to the recent rise of anti-enemy goods sentiment in the market, which has aroused fierce warnings from the Blood Soul Elimination Group, etc., has also received letters from colleagues inside and outside the industry. In addition to immediately publishing the original letters, it will hold an expanded meeting of the Executive Committee on August 2nd at 3:00 PM and invite colleagues to actively participate and attend the meeting together. If there are opinions to be expressed, they will be submitted as motions in accordance with the regulations to show respect. At that time, more than two hundred member representatives and brokers attended the meeting. First, Chairman Wang Yousong, due to his advanced age and poor health, entrusted Standing Committee member Gu Zhujun to act as chairman. After everyone took their seats, he reported that the industry's attitude towards enemy goods is different from that of other industries. Since the natural production of enemy goods and the cultivation of pearls, etc., they have been regarded as domestic goods, and inferior goods have been regarded as worthless. The boycott has been carried out from the beginning, and buying and selling in the market has not been allowed. This has been the case until now, without any compromise. This is not related to the previous Sino-Japanese negotiations. In short, other industries only began to boycott after taking a step back, but this industry did not. Because the authenticity of the goods is related to the industry's reputation and vital interests, the rejection of counterfeit goods is fundamental, permanent, and cannot follow other industries in boycotting enemy goods. Therefore, we should make ten, hundred, thousand times, or even unlimited efforts. Next, Executive Committee members Zhang Wandi, alternate Executive Committee member Zhu Baoqing, Standing Committee member Zhu Ziyi, Executive Committee members Zhu Xianghe, Shi Xianglin, Gu Yushan, Chen Huiquan, Ma Xintian, Ma Shoubai, etc., spoke one after another, each expressing important opinions. In particular, Zhang Wandi's words were the most sincere, upright, and admired by the public. He said, "Merchants seek profit from their capital. There is no need to hide the fact that they imported Japanese goods in the past. Now that the national crisis has not been resolved, the only thing to do is to follow our conscience, report ourselves, protect our personality, and set an example." Afterwards, Zhu Ziyi proposed to form an inspection committee and appoint special personnel to immediately pursue and strictly enforce the regulations. Yang Heqiao and ten others were immediately appointed to take charge. The Executive Committee gave them the authority to inspect counterfeit goods at any time in the market or in the shops of colleagues. If they were found, they would be immediately detained and reported and handed over to the Executive Committee for fair disposal. The resolution was passed in principle. The detailed rules for the inspection of counterfeit goods were to be decided by the inspectors themselves and submitted to the Executive Committee for approval and implementation. As for the regulations for the examination and punishment of counterfeit goods, only a few outlines were discussed. The supplementary details must be carefully formulated and announced by the Executive Committee. The meeting was then adjourned.</p>
<p>Coal Industry to Hold Executive Committee Meeting First: The Shanghai Coal Industry Association, after receiving two warning letters from the Red Blood Eliminate Traitors Group and the Iron Blood Eliminate Traitors Group the day before yesterday afternoon, originally planned to convene an emergency meeting yesterday to discuss countermeasures. However, due to the inability to notify members of the General Assembly in time, and before the General Assembly of the Association was convened, it was proposed to hold an Executive Committee meeting first to gather the opinions of the members before making a decision. Therefore, it was changed to hold a temporary Executive Committee meeting at 2:00 PM today to discuss countermeasures. Advice from the National Salvation Association: The Propaganda Conference of the National Salvation United Association held a regular meeting yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. More than ten representatives, including Shen Zurou, Zhang Tianbai, Chen Yafu, Chen Peide, Zhang Yichen, Wu Zhongdao, Liu Chuanzhong, Cao Zhigong, and Guo Xiuyan, attended. Many important cases were resolved, and a letter of advice to merchants across the country was issued regarding the anti-enemy goods upsurge in this city. The original text is as follows: To all Chambers of Commerce across the country, for the public review of compatriots in the business community across the country. Since the Shanghai Truce Agreement, Japan has attempted to restore trade with China and implement a dumping policy. Many of our compatriots in the business community have failed to understand the interests of the country and have sought personal gain by selling enemy goods in large quantities. Enemy goods have flooded the markets across the country. Fortunately, the people's hearts have not died, and patriotic people, regardless of any sacrifice, have used hot-blooded bombs to eliminate these traitors who sell enemy goods. This heroic and moving feat is truly admired by the people of the country. It is especially important to inform our compatriots in the business community that Japanese imperialism is the common enemy of the people of the country, and especially the long-term enemy of industry and commerce. Its invasion of the Northeast first destroyed Chinese industry and commerce. Its attack on Shanghai destroyed Chinese industry and commerce with artillery shells. Now, we are recognizing the thief as our father, selling enemy goods, harming our national strength, and promoting their national power. This kind of act of national destruction is both foolish and sad. Now, we are subject to the severe sanctions of bombs. Who says it is not appropriate? Which is more important, saving lives or seeking profit? Profit can be sought, but bombs are also to be feared. If we only care about ourselves and not the country, can individuals be safe if the country is destroyed? Regarding merit, demerit, benefit, and harm, we sincerely hope that the traitors who sell enemy goods will immediately understand and realize their error to avoid being hated by the people of the country. We also hope that the business community across the country will unite to eliminate internal traitors and promote domestic goods so that the violent sun will be subdued by our economic boycott movement and unable to extricate itself. The benefit of the country is also the glory of the business community. We hereby offer this sincere advice. We hope you will understand. Shanghai United Association of National Salvation Organizations, August 5th.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Japanese Goods Imported</h3>
<p>The Japanese ship Rokko Maru entered the port yesterday, carrying more than 16,800 pieces of Japanese goods, including more than 2,700 pieces to be transshipped to the Yangtze River and unloaded in Hankou, and more than 14,000 pieces to be unloaded in Shanghai. Piece goods still accounted for the majority. Japanese white sugar and Japanese pigments, which had not arrived in Shanghai for a long time, were also shipped yesterday. There was also some American cotton among the goods.</p>
<h3>More Postal Workers from Tokyo Arrived Yesterday</h3>
<p>And a Large Number of Mail Items Were Transported</p>
<p>The Dalian Maru arrived in Shanghai yesterday, bringing more postal workers from the Northeast and a large number of mail items. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Handling of Mail Items: The Dalian Maru brought more than two hundred bags of mail yesterday, including mail from European countries transferred from Siberia and mail from the three northeastern provinces transferred from Dalian. It is reported that the Shanghai Postal Administration has handled the mail in accordance with the method proposed by the General Administration, that is, mail from European countries bearing stamps of member countries of the Universal Postal Union will naturally be forwarded. Mail bearing domestic stamps within their own country will also be delivered without any problems. However, a very small number of mail items bearing stamps from the puppet state of Manchukuo will be calculated as unpaid postage and penalized with double the amount. It is also reported that the postal bureaus in the three northeastern provinces have not yet implemented this price increase, so ordinary letters sent from the Northeast only bear four cents in stamps. If the stamps are mistakenly affixed with counterfeit stamps, the recipient must pay an unpaid postage penalty of eight cents.</p>
<p>Huang Naishu's Remarks: Yesterday, a reporter from the Guowen News Agency specifically asked Huang Naishu, Director of the Postal Administration, about the handling of the mail items that had arrived. According to him, "I have not yet heard about the mail items that arrived today, because this matter is handled by the Shanghai Administration. However, Dalian is a leased territory that Japan has falsely taken from China and cannot be equated with the puppet state of Manchukuo. Therefore, the Dalian Post Office and the Shanghai Post Office are still, in fact, mutual mail exchange bureaus. Therefore, there is nothing strange about the exchange of mail. However, if there are any items bearing stamps from Manchukuo, they must be handled in accordance with the predetermined method."</p>
<p>More Postal Workers Arrived: After the previous arrival of four postal workers from the Jilin-Heilongjiang area and five postal workers from the Liaoning-Ningxia area, yesterday, Liang Bingzao (Faku Bureau), Lin Shuofan, Xu Guangquan, Shen Hanzhang, Zhong Dating, Gao Zongrui (all from Shenyang Bureau), Lin Shinan, Sun Changqi, Huang Qiushi (all from Yingkou Bureau), Su Zhongxun (Siping Street Bureau), and Lu Yinggang (Xinlitun Bureau) arrived, totaling fifteen people. They reported to the General Administration and submitted a report on their journey to Shanghai. They are currently staying at the hotel, and the General Administration plans to find ways to place them in postal bureaus in Shanghai and Hangzhou for work in the near future.</p>
<p>Mail from the Puppet State: Yesterday, Zhu Menghou, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Postal Administration, told a reporter from the Guowen News Agency that mail sent from the puppet state of Manchukuo to European and American countries can only be sent separately and cannot be sent in bulk, because it is not a member of the Universal Postal Union and therefore does not have the right to send in bulk. However, postal administrations in various countries follow the principles of the Universal Postal Union Charter, which are based on facilitating the people, so they do not discriminate and must forward them. However, the other party is not responsible for any loss of separately sent mail, and there is no exchange of money orders, so it is mostly limited to ordinary letters.</p>
<h3>National Salvation Association Opposes the Establishment of Post Offices by Japan</h3>
<p>The Shanghai United Association of National Salvation Organizations held a regular meeting yesterday, stating that Japan's establishment of post offices in the areas of Beijing, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Shanghai this time, due to our country's blockade of customs and postal services, clearly undermines our country's sovereignty. A telegram was sent to the government, requesting that it be stopped immediately. At the same time, a notice was issued to the foreign communities in this city, urging them not to lightly comply. The original telegram and notice are as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram to the Authorities: To President Wang of the Nanjing Executive Yuan and Minister Huang of the Ministry of Communications. It has been found that foreign post offices were abolished long ago at the Washington Conference. The Universal Postal Union Charter has clear provisions regarding the postal sovereignty of each country. Japan brazenly disregards all international covenants and uses violence to occupy the territory of the three northeastern provinces of our country. It also uses rebel organizations to forcibly seize our customs and postal services in the Northeast. Now, it is even establishing post offices in the provinces and cities of Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Qingdao, sending and receiving mail, which clearly infringes upon our country's postal sovereignty. The government should pay close attention and quickly seek effective ways to stop it. Otherwise, our people, provoked by righteous indignation, will inevitably take appropriate sanctions. Signed by Li Cishan, Yin Zhiling, Yu Kang, Liu Shixiong, and Tan Bozhi, Standing Directors of the Shanghai United Association of National Salvation Organizations.</p>
<p>Letter to Foreign Communities: To the Minghe Chamber of Commerce, for forwarding to all foreign communities. It has been found that foreign post offices in this country were abolished long ago at the Washington Conference. Now, Japan is establishing post offices in the provinces and cities of Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Qingdao in this country, sending and receiving mail, which clearly violates the Universal Postal Union Charter and infringes upon the postal sovereignty of this country. The people of this country deeply hate this illegal act. We hope that the foreign communities of your respective countries will pay special attention and refrain from using Japan's illegal post offices to deliver mail. If you do not understand this, we fear that the people of this country, provoked by righteous indignation, will inevitably take appropriate sanctions. Our association has always known that the foreign communities of your respective countries maintain justice and have very close feelings with the people of Shanghai. We are confident that you will understand what we mean. We hereby send this letter, hoping that you will take note. Shanghai United Association of National Salvation Organizations.</p>
<h3>Postage for Airmail to Europe</h3>
<p>According to news from the Shanghai Post Office, airmail transportation from Saigon to Marseille is now faster. The time from Saigon to Marseille has been reduced from eleven days to eight and a half days and is connected to the direct train mail service from Haiphong to Saigon, which runs three times a week. The train mail service has also been reduced to two and a half days. Therefore, airmail sent via this airmail route from Shanghai to Europe takes only sixteen to nineteen days. At a time when the Siberian mail route has been suspended, this airmail delivery service can be used to achieve speed and convenience. Except for insured mail, ordinary and registered mail accepted by post offices in all locations can be sent via this airmail route. The postage to be paid is as follows: In addition to paying the international ordinary postage and registration fee (if registered), airmail sent via this route should also pay the international airmail postage as follows:</p>
<p>Destination Location | Distance from Saigon (kilometers) | International Airmail Postage per 20 Grams or Fraction Thereof (National Currency)</p>
<p>Bangkok (Siam) | 850 | 2.20 yuan</p>
<p>Yangon (Burma) | 1,600 | 3.90 yuan</p>
<p>Kolkata (British India) | 3,000 | 7.20 yuan</p>
<p>Karachi (British India) | 5,400 | 1.30 yuan</p>
<p>Tashkent (Persia) | 6,400 | 1.54 yuan</p>
<p>Bushehr (Persia) | 7,500 | 1.75 yuan</p>
<p>Baghdad (Iraq) | 8,300 | 2.00 yuan</p>
<p>Beirut (Syria) | 9,200 | 2.21 yuan</p>
<p>Rhodes (Asia Minor) | 9,900 | 2.38 yuan</p>
<p>Athens (Greece) | 10,500 | 2.52 yuan</p>
<p>Naples (Italy) | 2,600 | 2.79 yuan</p>
<p>Marseille (France) | 12,500 | 3.00 yuan</p>
<p>If the mail is also delivered via airmail within China, an additional domestic airmail fee of one dime and five cents per section (flying area) in silver dollars should be charged. This airmail route does not deliver mail to the locations it passes through. Mail to other locations can also be sent via this route. For example, mail to eastern and central British India can be transshipped from Kolkata, mail to the Balkans can be transshipped from Athens, mail to Italy can be transshipped from Naples, and mail to European countries can be transshipped from Marseille.</p>
<h3>Northwest Problem Research Association Sends Off Shaanxi Industrial Inspection Delegation</h3>
<p>Li Dachao and Chen Binhe Both Give Speeches</p>
<p>China has a vast territory, and border problems are particularly important. Since the September 18th Incident, the three northeastern provinces have been completely lost in less than a month. As a result, the people of the country feel that border problems should be given even more attention. A group of scholars and experts in this city first initiated the Northwest Problem Research Association. Now, Guo Weiping, Gu Zhizhong, and others have initiated a Shaanxi Industrial Inspection Delegation, which will depart separately before the 10th of this month to gather in Zhengzhou and then go to Shaanxi for inspection. Yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM, the Northwest Problem Research Association specially held a farewell dinner for the inspection delegation at the cafeteria of the Chinese Arts and Crafts Society on Avenue Édouard VII. Li Dachao presided over the meeting. First, Chen Binhe, Director of Propaganda of the Northwest Problem Research Association, gave a speech, saying that the vanguard of Japan's invasion of the Northeast was actually scholars and experts. The scholars publicized the situation obtained from the inspection to their country, and then there were industrial investments and development. At the same time, politicians used their political power to support the development of industrialists. Today, the scholars and experts in Shanghai are able to devote their spirit of sacrifice and travel to the border regions, which is deeply admired. Li Dachao, Executive Director of the Research Association, then gave a speech, saying that the Northwest should not only be regarded as important because of its abundant resources, but also because the Northwest is the birthplace of the Chinese nation. In ancient times, the Northwest problem was not only not noticed by the people of the country, but even the people of the Northwest themselves failed to attach importance to it. Today, there are enthusiastic experts from this city who are going to inspect industry, which is an important page in the history of China's border development. After that, Ma Zongrong and Guo Weiping gave speeches one after another, making important statements on the issue of developing the Northwest. The meeting ended at 10:00 PM in a joyful atmosphere.</p>

<h3>Ningbo Ship Returned to Shanghai Late the Night Before Last</h3>
<p>Rescheduled to Resume Sailing Today</p>
<p>The Taikoo Company's New Peking and the Ning Shao Company's Old Ning Shao, both bound for Ningbo, temporarily suspended service on August 1 due to a strong typhoon in the Zhejiang waters and were rescheduled to depart on the 3rd. On the afternoon of that day, at 4:30 PM, the New Peking and other ships, fully loaded with passengers and cargo, departed from Shanghai. During the departure, the Xujiahui Observatory was consulted, and it was learned that the typhoon had reached the Yantai sea area and that the Zhejiang waters were navigable. The two ships then set sail one after the other. By the time they reached outside the Wusong Estuary, it was already past 7:00 PM. The New Peking encountered a strong wind and waves as soon as it left the estuary. The captain, fearing danger, telegraphed the Shanghai office for instructions and was ordered to return to Shanghai immediately. The New Peking then turned back to the Huangpu River. The Old Ning Shao, which was behind, received the news and did not dare to sail, so it returned to the port together. They arrived back at the pier at around 10:00 PM in the middle of the night. The passengers on board then refunded their tickets late at night and disembarked one after another. The matter was finally resolved at around 11:00 PM. The two ships, which have suspended two trips in a row, are scheduled to resume sailing today.</p>
<h3>Zhu and Zhang Telegraph Again, Declining the Position of Commander for Suppressing Bandits in Taihu Lake</h3>
<p>Zhu Shaoliang and Zhang Yin Telegraph Again Declining the Positions of Commander and Deputy Commander for Suppressing Bandits in Taihu Lake: To Chairman Jiang of the Nanjing Military Affairs Commission. The instructions issued on July 13 stated, "I have received your telegram regarding Dong. The banditry in Taihu Lake should be thoroughly suppressed. The Central Government has carefully selected personnel and issued new orders, hoping that you will suppress your humility and not insist on declining again. As for the concerns you have expressed, I have already instructed the suppression forces and local police districts in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to accept your decisions and strive to avoid them. I hope you will take office as soon as possible and coordinate the suppression to stabilize the local area and live up to my trust." Upon receiving this, we should have complied. How dare we refuse? However, being given such an important task with inadequate talent, we are even more afraid of being unable to fulfill it. We have previously expressed our sincerity in detail. Now, upon receiving your instructions, which are even more encouraging, we are even more apprehensive. Thinking again and again, Shaoliang and Yin, our talents and abilities are truly inadequate to the task, and the matter concerns two provinces, making it even more difficult to handle. Rather than causing delays in the future and failing your commission, it would be better to be prudent today, lay our hearts bare, and humbly request permission to resign and appoint other capable people so that Shaoliang and Yin can hide our foolishness in the local area and avoid delaying important public affairs. We are telegraphing in fear, hoping for your consideration. Zhu Shaoliang and Zhang Yin.</p>

<p>Support for the Northeastern Volunteer Army</p>
<h3>Report from the Radio Communications Team</h3>
<p>Yu Ruxin, Xu Xueyu, Hu Gangfu, Zhu Qiqing, and others jointly prepared the report on the establishment of the First Radio Communications Team to Support the Northeastern Volunteer Army: "Previously, considering that the Northeastern Volunteer Army was far away and had limited transportation, information was slow, which affected military affairs to no small extent. To achieve unified command and centralized intelligence, to help arms and fingers connect, and to eliminate the suffering of messengers from long distances, there is nothing better than setting up military radio stations and organizing a communications team, which is the simplest and most economical. Therefore, in late April, we made a proposal to the Shanghai Branch of the Technical Cooperation Committee and drafted a plan. In terms of machinery, at least five 50- to 100-watt radio stations and at least ten 5-watt stations are required. A communication network and system diagram were drawn, and the budget for the machines was approximately 35,000 yuan, with monthly recurring expenses of approximately 6,600 yuan. We immediately started to work on it, actively seeking donations on one hand and soliciting communication talents on the other. After a month of preparation, we had a considerable number of qualified personnel. However, in terms of fundraising, there was a significant shortfall, and we were unable to proceed according to the original plan. In early June, because the Volunteer Army was in urgent need of assistance, we had to change the plan, reduce the scope, and aim to purchase as many machines as possible and depart immediately. After several days of hard work, we managed to raise funds for six radios and contacted the China Radio Research Society, Dahua Electric Company, and China Three-Electrode Ray Electric Company to undertake the manufacturing. These companies were enthusiastic patriots and generously agreed to donate their labor to rush the manufacturing, only charging for the cost of materials. We paid the China Research Society 2,400 yuan for machine materials, Dahua Electric Company 2,400 yuan for machine materials, and Three-Electrode Ray Electric Company 1,000 yuan for machine materials. On May 27, we sent a letter to the International Telecommunication Bureau requesting that they issue radio station passports. By June 8, everything was ready. Four telegraphers and mechanics escorted the machines and transported them to the three northeastern provinces. According to a telegram from Peiping, these personnel have already crossed the border and are on their way. We believe that they will definitely provide assistance to the army in the future. However, the establishment of this communications team was limited by funding and failed to proceed according to the original plan, which is regrettable. The government's assistance is both physically limited and politically restricted. Therefore, the efforts of the people are even more urgent. If the Volunteer Army cannot last due to communication obstacles, not only will the hard work of several months be lost in one day, but the Changbai Mountains and the Heilongjiang River will also be permanently separated from our territory. Looking at the difficulties and dangers, we must appeal again, hoping that patriots will continue to work hard, continue to raise funds, and organize a second batch of communication teams to cross the border and provide assistance. Rapid communication is beneficial to military affairs. If military affairs are beneficial, then the Northeast will not be difficult to recover. Patriotic citizens, let us rise up!"</p>

<h3>Zheng Baozhao Discusses Responsible Transportation</h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Railways, in order to rectify the cargo transportation business of railways across the country, ordered all railways to prepare for responsible transportation, the Jinghu and Huhang railways have been actively planning and preparing for implementation by the Traffic Department. It is now heard that the implementation date is not far off. A reporter specifically inquired about news and his personal opinions from Mr. Zheng Baozhao, the Chief of the Traffic Department of the railway. The remarks of Mr. Zheng are as follows:</p>
<p>According to the practice in European and American countries, responsible transportation has long been implemented in railways. For merchants, in principle, there is no such thing as being irresponsible for the goods being transported. However, reasonable limits are placed on the responsibilities assumed, and necessary exceptions are specified. Only in our country's railways, although there is the name of responsible transportation, in reality, due to various obstacles, it has not been universally implemented. Only the Beining Railway within the pass has already implemented it; the remaining railways are all nominally so, but not in reality. This has a great impact on the development of railway services and the social economy. Recently, the Ministry of Railways, seeing this, ordered all railways to actively prepare and gradually promote it. Since receiving the order, the Traffic Department has convened several meetings with the heads of the Commercial Affairs Section and the Scheduling Section, as well as cargo transportation inspectors. Currently, personnel equipment and various issues have been discussed in detail, and appropriate measures have been formulated. It is scheduled to begin implementation on September 1st, and substantial progress will be made in the future. Because the Beining Railway has a long route and has achieved good results in two years, the Jinghu and Huhang railways have shorter routes, so there should be no problems. As for how the implementation of responsible transportation by the railway will affect merchants, this is also what society wants to know. The key points are as follows: (1) The railway assumes responsibility for compensation for losses within a considerable range, which can directly reduce the burden on merchants and indirectly promote the prosperity of industry and commerce. This is the first advantage. (2) If any losses occur to the goods undertaken by the railway, although it bears the responsibility for compensation according to regulations, the additional freight charged is generally only 10%. That is, merchants bear only minimal obligations and can enjoy maximum guarantees. This is the second advantage. (3) Since the railway bears actual responsibility, merchants can trust it and directly consign goods, thus eliminating all kinds of indirect troubles. This is the third advantage. (4) The railway issues bills of lading for responsible transportation, and merchants can use them to discount at banks. This will promote merchants' economic turnover and the social financial circulation. This is the fourth advantage. Although what has been said above is not exhaustive, the benefits of responsible transportation for society and merchants can already be seen. Therefore, at the beginning of implementation, it is deeply hoped that society will provide guidance and cooperate.</p>

<h3>Declaration of the Eighth Anniversary of the Anti-Drug Association</h3>
<p>The Chinese National Anti-Drug Association issued the following declaration to mark the eighth anniversary of its founding today: (August 5, 1924, this association was established in the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. Time flies, and eight years have passed in a flash. Looking back on the past and observing the present situation, we cannot help but feel endless thoughts and grief. On the occasion of the eighth anniversary, we must say something to the people of the country. The association's eight years of struggle and work standards have been guided by the Premier’s instructions against drugs and have been devoted to fulfilling the people’s earnest entrustment. Therefore, although we have experienced all kinds of hardships and dangers, we have never been afraid or slack. We always respond to unexpected reversals with a calm and steady spirit. We are not discouraged by coercion or tempted by profits. We have never been dominated by the environment or involved in political vortexes. We have always taken the public's position and engaged in pure struggles. After weathering storms and experiencing trials, we dare not say that we have taken on the heavy responsibility of transforming and overcoming difficulties, but we have at least made a modest contribution to revitalizing the world and advancing progress. This is a fact that the people of the country do not deny, and it is not the association boasting of its own merits. However, the reason why the achievements are still only limited to this after eight years is multifaceted. Generally speaking, the deep harm caused by drugs in our country, the incompetence of those in charge of prohibition, and the indifference of the people to the anti-drug movement have all presented great obstacles to this association. The past is gone. Opium public sales are still being loudly promoted, and dangers abound. Although this association is mindful of the deep abyss, we are still worried about the sighs of breaking. The danger of the situation is even greater than in the past seven years. Therefore, this association is not yet confident whether it can break through this current harsh environment. Because this association has tried its best to fulfill its anti-drug responsibilities for eight years, we have made enemies and incurred resentment, and those who want to harm us are everywhere. Moreover, due to financial difficulties, our work has been greatly affected. We have few helping hands and many people throwing stones at us. It is not difficult to imagine the situation of this association, which is barely surviving, struggling day and night in a storm. Fortunately, in recent years, the people of the country have shown great sympathy for the anti-drug movement and have gradually become aware of the harm of opium. Therefore, they are also more concerned about the situation of this association and have given us encouragement and support. Based on this glimmer of hope, this association is even more determined to fight forward, recognizing that anti-drug is a movement to save the country and protect the race, and it is our sacred work. We must fight for complete prohibition with a spirit that knows no death or interval. We must have the ambition of the Foolish Old Man who moved mountains and the sincerity of Jingwei filling the sea. As long as the scourge of drugs is not eliminated, this association's responsibility will not be fulfilled. When the disaster of drugs is eliminated, this association will be able to relieve its responsibility. We vow not to fail the initial aspirations of the past eight years and the earnest expectations of the people of the country. This declaration is hereby made.</p>

<h3>Tianzhang Factory: Workers to Resume Work Today</h3>
<p>Accepting Advice from Party and Government Agencies</p>
<p>Wage Issues to Await Mediation</p>
<p>After the strike by all workers at the Pudong factory of the Shanghai Tianzhang Paper Mill, they accepted advice from party and government agencies yesterday and decided to resume work today, pending legal mediation of the wage increase issue. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Company Announcement: Since the workers' strike, Tianzhang Manufacturing Factory has sought to stop the strike from party and government agencies, and announced that workers must resume work uniformly on the fourth day, or else they will be considered voluntarily dismissed. At the same time, it requested the authorities to punish the leaders. After hearing this, all workers believed that the company was adopting a high-pressure policy and vowed not to resume work and to continue the struggle to the end, and requested the authorities to severely punish the company. As a result, those who resumed work yesterday morning were nowhere to be seen. The company manager invited Wu Gengsheng, the director of the labor union, and others to negotiate directly at 9:00 AM yesterday morning, but the meeting ended without result.</p>
<p>Party and Government Advice: After receiving reports from both labor and management, the Social Affairs Bureau dispatched Zhu Guilin and Zhang Sheng from the Municipal Party Department to investigate and advise the workers to resume work first and await legal mediation. The Paper Industry Union of the Fifth District agreed to convene an extraordinary meeting of representatives in the afternoon to discuss and decide on a solution. However, factory director Di Shaolin believed that the workers' actions violated the Municipal Government's announcement and requested strict punishment. He insisted on the original proposal regarding wage increases and maintained a tough stance, stating that there was no room for mediation.</p>
<p>Decision to Resume Work: At 3:00 PM yesterday, the Paper Industry Union of the Fifth District convened an extraordinary meeting of representatives to solicit the workers' opinions. Wu Gengsheng chaired the meeting, and representatives from party and government agencies attended to advise. All workers were determined to fight to the death because the company had no sincerity. After repeated persuasion, they decided to resume work on the 5th and await mediation, provided that wages during the strike period be paid as usual and that workers not be dismissed without reason afterward. Representatives from party and government agencies agreed at the time to convene a mediation meeting in the shortest possible time. The labor union then notified the workers to comply.</p>
<h3>Jiangwan Disaster Victims Request Universal Relief</h3>
<p>The Jiangwan District Disaster Relief Association sent a letter yesterday to the Shanghai and Songhu Relief Committees, requesting the speedy allocation of funds for relief. The letter stated: We have learned that during the recent Songhu War, the entire territory of our district was devastated by enemy troops, and the loss of life and property suffered by the people was unprecedented. Our association has repeatedly compiled statistics on the disaster and disclosed them in newspapers, and has been running around calling for assistance for the disaster victims in the entire district. Half a year has passed, and there has been much publicity, but not a single cent has been allocated from the promised ten million yuan in bonds to be used for relief in the Songhu war zone, or from the 300,000 yuan in cash to be used for urgent relief. The disaster victims are all waiting anxiously. However, looking around at the districts of Baoshan County adjacent to our district, their disaster situation is not as severe as that of our district, but universal relief funds for disaster-stricken households have already been fully distributed. Therefore, the people of our district have been coming to the association to inquire about the situation in recent days. We believe that your association is the savior of the disaster victims in all districts of this city and will not bear to sit idly by and watch these fish gasping for breath in a dry rut. Therefore, we dare to submit this report and respectfully request that you quickly allocate relief funds to universally distribute to the disaster-stricken households in our district, taking into account the severity of the disaster, in order to help them survive. We are awaiting your urgent orders and cannot express our gratitude enough. In addition, the association has stated that since most of its work is being handled in Jiangtao, it has moved its offices from the Guilin Road and Yanqing Road locations to No. 242 Laobazi Road, using the National Medical Association as its office.</p>
<h3>Health Bureau Reports on Cholera Prevention in June</h3>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau submitted a report to the Municipal Government yesterday regarding the cholera situation in June for review. The original report is transcribed below: This bureau has been organizing cholera prevention injections for many years, and they have had considerable effectiveness. This year, the war occurred, and the livelihood of the citizens was undermined. The environment and living conditions have deteriorated. The spread of disease is inevitable, especially during the summer months when cholera is prevalent. Therefore, it was anticipated that the epidemic would be more severe than in previous years. Prevention injections are essential. According to the bureau's survey, the majority of those affected lived in or near the war zone. Since the ceasefire agreement, staff have been dispatched to carry out prevention injections. In addition to the situation handled in May, which has already been reported, a total of 208,409 injections were given in June, of which 52,630 were given in the war zone. While working in the war zone, although every household was encouraged to participate, aiming for thoroughness, the vast majority actively accepted, but many were ignorant and missed the opportunity. Most of these were laborers who benefited from the cholera prevention injections. The results are still good. In addition to ordering staff to continue to work hard, we should also present a statistical table of the number of people vaccinated against cholera in June and the implementation situation for review and approval.</p>
<p>Summary table of the number of people vaccinated against cholera in June 1932</p>
<p>| Injection Target | Single Dose | Completed | Single Dose | Completed |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| Schools | 30,733 | 26,844 | 3,850 | 61,427 |</p>

<h3>Cholera Weekly Report from the Port Quarantine Office</h3>
<p>Number of Cases Increased Compared to Previous Week</p>
<p>Wu Liande, Director of the Port Quarantine Office and Director of the Central Cholera Prevention Office, issued the tenth cholera weekly report yesterday. The contents are recorded below:</p>

<p>| **Total Overall** | **2570 (42 foreigners)** | **175 (12 foreigners)** |</p>
<p>(3) This year's cholera mortality rate in Shanghai is still the lowest compared to other epidemic areas. The table is as follows:</p>
<p>| Area | Population | Date | Cases | Deaths | Percentage |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| Nanjing | 561,442 | July 21-30 | 839 | 173 | 20.6 |</p>
<p>| Hankou | 777,993 | April 23-July 23 | 190 | 34 | 19.0 |</p>
<p>| Xiamen | 164,984 | June 18-July 23 | 958 | 482 | 50.3 |</p>
<p>| Guangzhou | 812,241 | May 21-July 23 | 1039 | 372 | 35.8 |</p>
<p>| Shanghai | 12,124,212 | May 7-July 30 | 2518 | 173 | 6.9 |</p>
<p>(4) The cholera cases found on ships are detailed below: (A) The Japanese mail ship Shanghai Maru left Shanghai on July 23 and arrived in Kobe on the 25th. One Chinese sailor suffered from cholera. After arriving at the port, all passengers and sailors on the ship were given prevention injections, and the ship was fumigated, disinfected, and quarantined for four days before being released. (B) The Taigu Company's Taiyuan ship left Shanghai on July 20 and arrived in Xiamen on the 22nd. One person died of cholera outside the cargo hold. All 125 crew members and 343 passengers were given prevention injections, and the ship was disinfected before being released on the 23rd and sailing to Hong Kong. (C) One sailor on the British Company's Gusilai passenger ship suffered from cholera on July 26. The captain and eight sailors were given prevention injections, and the sailors' stool samples were tested for bacteria daily. Fortunately, the results were negative. (D) The China Merchants Bureau's Guangji ship arrived in Shanghai from Wenzhou on July 31 and found two sailors suffering from cholera. The ship was ordered to anchor in the middle of the Huangpu River, and the cholera patients were immediately sent to the hospital. The 31 passengers and 73 sailors were given prevention injections, and the ship was disinfected.</p>
<p>(5) The number of cholera prevention injections given in Shanghai is shown in the table below:</p>
<p>| Area | July | Previous Total | Grand Total |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| Shanghai City | 184,500 | 505,526 | 489,826 |</p>
<p>| International Settlement | 50,121 | 84,287 | 155,408 |</p>
<p>| French Concession | 19,925 | 29,586 | 49,509 |</p>
<p>| **Total** | **254,544** | **420,599** | **674,743** |</p>
<p>The total number of cholera prevention injections given last year was 534,446, and this year it has already exceeded that number.</p>
<p>(6) During this hot weather, various fresh fruits are on the market, all intended to relieve heat and quench thirst. Some say that it is possible to drink raw water, and others like to eat cold drinks and fruits such as peaches and plums. The three health authorities in the Chinese concessions are paying close attention to the tap water in their respective areas. In addition to strictly ordering the water companies to use the most precise scientific filtration and aeration methods, they must also conduct bacteriological tests on water samples every day. If so, then drinking raw is also acceptable. This year, no cases of illness caused by drinking such raw water have been found. The water source for filtered water in Shanghai seems to be improper, but according to the United States, there are several water sources that are even more turbid than the Huangpu River, and they can also be safely drunk once they are scientifically treated.</p>
<p>Ice cubes from the nine major registered companies in the concessions are quite safe. For melons and fruits, only look for undamaged skins. It is best to wash the outside with water before eating, then immerse it in boiling water for a minute. For fruits such as peaches and apricots, immerse them in a bleaching powder solution (one teaspoon of powder to forty gallons of water) or hydrogen peroxide (one to two thousand times water) before eating. The knowledge of cholera carriers has been fully understood. Housekeepers must not overlook the possibility of transmission if food utensils have been used by patients or handled with unclean hands.</p>
<h3>Recent News from the Nanhui Plague Hospital</h3>
<p>Nanhui is located near Songhu. Since the fighting, the plague has been rampant, with more than a thousand deaths. Xu Baiyi, the president of the Red Cross branch in the county, and others could not bear to sit idly by, so they donated large sums of money and invited highly qualified graduates of the Southeast Medical College, doctors Zhang Chen and Zhou Honggeng, to serve as medical directors, as well as female doctor Ren Yuehua, etc., to open the hospital on July 30. Recently, the number of patients seeking treatment day and night has been overwhelming, with more than two or three hundred people in recent days. The most dangerous cases were those of Xu Tongsheng and Xu Qinshi, who were on the verge of death. Chen Hesheng, the chief of general affairs, introduced doctors Zhang and Zhou, who injected them with saline solution, and they quickly recovered.</p>
<h3>The Chinese Leprosy Relief Association to Convene the National Leprosy Conference</h3>
<p>The Conference is Scheduled for October 5th and 6th</p>
<p>The venue will be at the Lester Institute on Hartung Road. The Chinese Leprosy Relief Association originally scheduled the National Leprosy Conference for April 15th and 16th, inviting national leprosy experts and social enthusiasts. All motions and papers had been finalized and arrangements completed. However, due to the sudden outbreak of the Shanghai Incident, the conference could not be held as scheduled. It is now learned that the board of directors of the association has recently decided to reschedule the conference to October 5th and 6th. The conference venue has been selected as the Lester Institute on Hartung Road.

<h3>A Tiger-Faced Crab from Taihu Lake</h3>
<p>A villager named Jia in the Toutou Village of Wuxi Taihu Lake caught a strange crab. The pattern on the crab's back vividly resembled a tiger's face, with piercing eyes. The crab was quite frightening. The villager took it home, and the news spread, with many people visiting to see it. Later, an employee of a foreign firm in Shanghai, Mr. Ouyang, went to Wuxi on business. After hearing the story, he went to see the crab. Finding it truly rare, he bought it from the villager for three hundred yuan in foreign currency and took it back to Shanghai. A Westerner in the foreign firm offered to pay Mr. Ouyang two thousand yuan in foreign currency to relinquish it so that he could take it to the British Museum in London for people to study. The two sides are currently in negotiations.</p>

<h3>Hardoon's Tenants Most Oppose Lunar Calendar Rent Collection</h3>
<p>Hardoon &amp; Co. issued hundreds of solicitor's letters in the past two weeks, sternly demanding overdue rent. Trials regarding the lawsuit have already begun, with shops like Tianbao Zhai on Second Ma Road, on the eighth Civil Court of the Special District Court, which went to trial mediation the day before yesterday. The lawyer representing the plaintiff was Tang Huaiqun, and the defendant was represented by Jiang Chiping. Mediation failed because the defendant did not admit to owing rent. Apart from the rents after April during the war, they had already notified the landlord to collect the rents, but the landlord ignored it, so they had no choice but to temporarily deposit the money in the bank. As for the rent during the war, business was suspended, and the benefits of using the buildings were cut off completely. They asked the landlord to waive this rent. What everyone opposes is the lunar calendar rent collection method used by the company. For many years, tenants have lost months of rent. Now that business is depressed, it is necessary to correct this immediately. This Mr. Lang Jun, the economic leader, is the chairman of the Hardoon Tenants' Association and has been elected by the assembly to be responsible for resolving the dispute with the landlord. If there is no solution to the above disputes, he has decided to sacrifice his personal business and interests and listen to the highest legal authority to resolve the issue.</p>

<h3>British Consulate Opens Trial for Indian Police Killing Chinese</h3>
<p>The Public Security Bureau Dispatches Personnel as Plaintiff's Representatives</p>
<p>Presenting Two Points: Demand for Punishment and Compensation</p>
<p>The Police Station Dispatches Personnel Today to Survey the Scene of the Incident</p>
<p>The British Consulate Argues to Investigate First, Then Open Debate</p>
<p>At around 2 PM on the 2nd of this month, Zhou A'yu of Li Zhong Lane, Hongfei Hong Road, Hongkou, was moving furniture when five Indian police officers, including You Sha, stopped him and stabbed him and his brother Zhou A'san and four others with small steel knives, causing a sensation throughout the city. After the incident, two of the perpetrators, Manhua Sigen and Ai Li Haida, were arrested by Chinese police officers Cui Xiangtian and others from the Huishan Police Station. The remaining three, You Sha, Shamen Gen, and Ala Date, were arrested by Inspector Wang Yan and others from the Hongzhen Branch of the Fifth District Third Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau and sent to the Third Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. After a preliminary trial on the morning of the 3rd, the case was extradited by the British Consul General, who sent Inspector Sha Meng (transliteration) of the Public Works Department's police department. The case opened at the British Consulate General at 11 AM yesterday (the 4th). The Municipal Public Security Bureau was notified in advance and ordered the personnel handling the case, as well as the parties involved and witnesses, to be present for questioning. Wen Yingxing, the Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, believing that the Indian police had killed innocent civilians without cause, specially ordered Qu Sunyi, Assistant Officer of the Third Section, to lead Inspector Wang Yan of the Hongzhen Branch of the Fifth District Third Section, Dong Wu, the landlady of the second room of Zhou A'yu, the deceased from Li Zhong Lane, and witness Xu Junchuan, along with blood-stained clothing and official letters, to the British Consulate on Huangpu Beach Road. After Assistant Officer Qu met with British Consul Davi Sheng, Pan Lisihuaide (transliteration), a British Royal lawyer hired by the British Consulate, first asked Wang Yan, who was handling the case, about the location of the incident and the circumstances of the arrest of the Indian police and the seizure of the murder weapon. Inspector Xue'er Si of the Huishan Police Station recorded the information, and Chinese Inspector Tao Genrong served as the translator. Then, Assistant Officer Qu accused the defendant, Indian police officer You Sha, of intentional homicide, and Shamen Ji, Ala Date, Manhua Sigen, and Aitain Haida of joint homicide. The presiding judge, Hams (transliteration), ordered the representative of the plaintiff to swear an oath in court before stating the case and requesting punishment for the murderers and compensation for the families of the deceased. The presiding judge stated that the plaintiff's request for punishment and compensation for damages were matters of diplomatic procedure. The court adjourned at 1 PM and resumed at 2 PM with Hams presiding in the Third Criminal Court. Those present in court were plaintiff lawyer Pan Lisihuaide, defendant lawyer Li Wensideng, Inspector Sha Meng of the Public Works Department Police Department, Inspector Xue'er Si of the Hongkou Huishan Police Station (Chinese Inspector Tao Genrong, along with six Chinese police officers including 731 and 2836), plaintiff representative Qu Sunyi, Inspector Wang Yan of the Fifth District Third Section, along with police chiefs Chen Yaxi, Huo Fengchi, and Pan Zhenglin, injured party Yi A'san, landlady Ye Wu, witness Xu Junchuan, defendants You Sha, Shamen Gen, Ala Date, Manhua Sigen, and Ai Li Haida, and Chinese and foreign detectives. About a hundred people were in the audience. First, presiding judge Hams and the plaintiff's lawyer jointly questioned Cui Xiangtian, Chinese Police Officer No. 73 of the Huishan Police Station. Cui stated that at 2 PM on the 2nd of this month, he received a report of a fight near Li Zhong Lane and went to the scene. He saw the Indian police officers running out of Li Zhong Lane with knives, so he stopped them with a gun. The Indian police officers still ran north, so he sounded the police whistle and chased them on Zhoushan Road. Later, Chinese Police Officer No. 2836 helped him arrest Indian police officers Mihua Gen and Ai Li Haida south of Gongping Road and took them back to the police station. Next, Inspector Wang Yan was questioned. He stated that at 2 PM that afternoon, he received a report that the Indian police had caused trouble and went to the scene with the police chief. He saw the deceased Zhou A'yu lying on the ground, lifeless, about half a mile from Li Zhong Lane. He turned towards Li Zhong Lane and saw the perpetrators coming towards him, trying to escape, so he arrested them. He searched their residence and found a steel knife, which he examined. Later, the defendant's lawyer requested that the judge inspect the scene of the incident and examine how the deceased died to find out the truth. The British Consul sent a letter to Qu Sunyi, the representative of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and today, the Huishan Police Station will first go to the scene to investigate and collect the blood samples taken from the deceased at the time of the autopsy. It is said that the British Consul is paying close attention to this case and will start the debate after the investigation is completed. The court adjourned at 4 PM and the defendants were returned to custody. Later, the plaintiff's lawyer questioned the witnesses and injured police chief in detail, and they dispersed at 5 PM. It is reported that the plaintiff is seeking compensation for the deceased's family, based on Zhou A'yu's monthly salary of 60 yuan and the amount he would have earned from the age of 27 to 60, which is 23,760 yuan, plus funeral expenses of 190 yuan.</p>
<h3>Russian Beggar Case Concludes Debate Yesterday</h3>
<p>Chinese and Western Doctors Prove No Injuries</p>
<p>Beggar Brother Questions Not Being Sent to Hospital</p>
<p>Lawyers Debate, Premier Leaves the Court</p>
<p>Drug Director Was Summoned to Testify Yesterday</p>
<p>The case of Russian beggar George Lattieff dying in custody at the Second Special District Court on June 19th and his brother Simon Grankie reporting to the French Concession police that he had been beaten to death by a guard, and the police department filing a public lawsuit against Xu Chongwen, warden of the detention center, medical officer She Mingbi, and guard Zhou Zongxiang, has been tried twice.</p>
<p>Examination Reveals No Injuries. Famous British and French physicians Weili Yue and Si Mishi were invited to re-examine the body with the court forensic doctor Wei Ligong. The results showed no injuries on the face, and the nasal bone was an old injury. There were also no traces of dysentery on the feces stains on the trousers. It was confirmed that the death was due to illness. The three doctors issued a written examination report (in Western language), which was translated into Chinese by translator Hua Maosheng and submitted to Judge Wang for review.</p>
<p>Third Continued Hearing Yesterday. The defendants hired five lawyers: Zhao Chen, Shan Yuhua, Liu Shixiong, Jiang Yiping, and Li Shirui, as defense lawyers. Jiang and Li lawyers were the joint defense lawyers for the three defendants. Yesterday was the third continued hearing of this case. At 9:30 AM, the defendants, their lawyers, and the plaintiffs, along with their lawyer Premier and three witnesses (Russians), arrived at the court to await instructions. Police Department lawyer Fei Xizhen appeared in court. Judge Wang Gangxu completed the petty cases of the police station and temporarily adjourned the court.</p>
<p>The Court President Also Attends the Trial. At 11:10 AM, Judge Wang Gangxu and Clerk Zhu Chengchao re-entered the No. 1 Criminal Court for trial. Court President Ying Shi and Head Clerk Xiao Jinfang were still seated behind the judge's seat to listen to the trial. Due to the fact that Legal Consultant of the Public Works Department, Du Ge, was on vacation in a foreign country, he sent a representative to the court to observe the trial. The court ordered all parties to the case to appear in court. After briefly inquiring about their names, the official ordered Russian translator Zhang Qingchun to read the examination report of the re-examined body to the plaintiff. The brother of the deceased requested to take back the nasal bone of the deceased for burial. The official said that it would be decided after the case was concluded.</p>
<p>The Plaintiff Raises Three Points. The official said to the plaintiff, "Now, according to the results of the autopsy, his death is not related to injury." The plaintiff took out a piece of paper (with Russian written on it) from his pocket and presented it to the court, saying that there were three points: "(1) The detention center saw that my brother was sick and did not send him to the hospital. (2) He had been sick in the detention center for three days, why didn't the medical officer diagnose him? (3) He asked for medical treatment in the detention center, but he was not treated." At this point, the court ordered the three Russian plaintiffs and three Russians to leave the court to be questioned separately.</p>
<p>Lawyers Make Eloquent Arguments. At that time, defendant's lawyer Li Shirui stood up and raised the question of determining the relationship and status of the plaintiff Simon Grantky with the deceased, which caused a fierce debate between the plaintiff's lawyer Premier and the defendant's lawyers. At the same time, Zhao, Shan, Liu, and Jiang lawyers argued that the plaintiff's status was undetermined, and that in the case of public prosecution by the police department, the plaintiff did not need to hire a lawyer. Lawyer Pu claimed that the lawyer was acting as an agent for the plaintiff in a related civil lawsuit. The court asked Pu to which defendant he was requesting an ancillary civil action. Pu replied that he would raise it after the public prosecution was completed. The official said that an ancillary civil action should be raised before the conclusion of the oral debate. After reviewing the power of attorney, it was not stated that he was acting as an agent for the plaintiff in an ancillary civil action. The defendant's lawyers requested that the court order lawyer Pu to withdraw from the court in accordance with the law because lawyer Pu did not have the commission of an ancillary civil action. After lawyer Pu raised another heated debate, Judge Wang told lawyer Pu that since he did not have an ancillary civil action, he should stop speaking. At this point, Pu declared that he would voluntarily withdraw from the lawyer's seat.</p>
<p>Questioning of the Defendants. The court ordered the defendants Xu Chongwen, warden of the detention center, medical officer Yu Honggao, guard Zhou Zongxiang, and the three Russian witnesses for the plaintiff, Zhilupu Dalaifu, Gulu Ciji, and Kefosini Gufu, to be brought to court for questioning one by one (the words of the questions and answers are roughly the same as those recorded in the previous report and will not be repeated). Finally, Cao Jianyou, the Russian translator of the detention center, was summoned for questioning. According to his testimony, he had only been working in the detention center for three months. At about 5 PM on June 17th, I went to the door of room No. 4 with the medical officer. George Lattieff was sleeping on the ground near the door. When asked what was wrong, he said that he had heatstroke, stomachache, and diarrhea. After I asked, I left. I don't know what happened after that.</p>
<p>Drug Director's Testimony. Li Dianzhong, director of the drug department of the detention center, was also summoned to testify whether the medical officer had come to collect medicine after diagnosing the Russian prisoner who was ill at that time. He replied that the medical officer had come to issue a medicine order. On June 17th, he came to issue a water order for relief. He came to collect medicine three times. The official ordered all the medicine collection slips to be submitted to the court for detailed inspection and then ordered the debate to begin.</p>
<p>Declaring the Debate Closed. First, Police Department lawyer Fei Xizhen stood up to debate (the third defendant Zhou Zongxiang was first prosecuted for injury under Article 296 of the Criminal Law, but now he is being prosecuted under Article 310, Section 1 of the Criminal Law for abandonment, which is the same as the other two defendants). Then, the defendant's lawyers debated in accordance with the law, and the court declared the debate closed and adjourned the court pending a scheduled verdict. The clock struck four when the court adjourned.</p>
<h3>One Woman with Two Husbands, One Son with Two Fathers</h3>
<p>Xu Jiping's Double Marriage</p>
<p>Married Hu Bingheng in Year 15</p>
<p>Married Ye Lishao Again in Year 16</p>
<p>Son Doesn't Know Who His Biological Father Is</p>
<p>Ye Lishao Accuses Her of Profiting from the Son</p>
<p>Hu Bingheng, the manager of Jin Cheng Qian Zhuang on Tianzhutang Street in the French Concession, was recently accused by Xu Jiping of Jiaxing, who once studied at Chizhi University, of crimes such as fraudulent marriage, seduction, and abandonment in the First Court of the Special District. Hu and Xu met in the 15th year of the Republic of China, and then married, having two sons and two daughters. Recently, Hu was unwilling to pay maintenance, which led to litigation. After Judge Wu Tingqi opened the court for trial, because Hu and Xu were formally married, the couple had no right to sue themselves, so the lawsuit was dismissed. Afterwards, Xu Jiping refused to accept the judgment and appealed to the civil court of the court to confirm her identity. At that time, Hu said that he and Xu met in the 15th year of the Republic of China, first privately, then lived together, which was not a formal marriage. Because Xu had married</p>
<p>Ye Lishao of Fengjing</p>
<p>in the 16th year of the Republic of China, and divorced in the 20th year of the Republic of China, their eldest son, Duansheng, was born at that time, so whether the child was born to Hu or to Ye became a problem. In order to clarify the case, Hu Bingheng invited Ye to Shanghai to testify in court at the court hearing on the 28th of last month. At that time, Ye, in the capacity of a witness, presented the contract signed when he divorced Xu to prove that Duansheng was indeed his own child, but Xu denied it. Because Hu and Xu's lawsuit could not be concluded for a while, the court ordered a rescheduling for another trial. After the court adjourned, Ye Lishao suddenly</p>
<p>Grabbed Xu Jiping</p>
<p>and said he wanted to punish her for defrauding money and concealing her young son. Xu claimed that Ye used violence and coercion, endangering her life. The two immediately appointed lawyers and filed a lawsuit in court. Judge Fu Lin opened the court for trial and advised both parties not to file a lawsuit over a trivial matter and rescheduled for another review. Yesterday was another court date, and Judge Wu Zhen tried the case in the Third Criminal Court. Xu's lawyer stated that Ye used violence, coercion, endangering life and body, and smoked opium, requesting an investigation and punishment in accordance with the law. After Xu Jiping retired from the civil court, Ye Lishao suddenly used</p>
<p>Violent behavior to harm</p>
<p>the self-plaintiff, making her unable to resist. Therefore, in accordance with the provisions of Article 319 of the Criminal Law, she requested legal action and a joint legal action to verify the defendant's opium smoking addiction. Ye Lishao also entrusted lawyer Fei Guoxi to file a lawsuit against Xu Jiping for obstructing marriage, deliberately defrauding money, concealing her legitimate son, intending to profit, and attaching an ancillary civil action, requesting the return of the legitimate son. The statement said that the self-plaintiff was studying at Pudong Middle School in Shanghai in the 14th year of the Republic of China and was quite close to his classmate Xu Renji (the defendant's brother), and Xu Renji introduced the defendant to him as a friend, so their love deepened and they fell in love. In the 16th year of the Republic of China, in the first month of the lunar calendar, a boy was born in the West Gate Maternity Hospital in Shanghai. Wang Qinqiu mediated the marriage, and they married on the 20th day of the third month of the lunar calendar in the</p>
<p>Cangzhou Hotel in Hangzhou</p>
<p>and prepared several gold utensils, a betrothal gift of 200 yuan, and clothing, etc. At that time, male matchmaker Cai Yaozong, female matchmaker Ye Tongshu, and the self-plaintiff's brother Ye Fu and the defendant's father Xu Xuanchen were the officiants. After the marriage, they lived in Hangzhou for twelve days and then returned to the self-plaintiff's home in Fengjing. After the month, the defendant returned to her mother's home. The self-plaintiff also lived in the wife's home because of his love. In the eighth month of the same year, the self-plaintiff went to Hankou to do business, and the defendant drifted between Shanghai and Fengjing. In the tenth month of the same year, the self-plaintiff returned to Shanghai from Hankou and met the defendant. When asked where the child was, the defendant said that the child had died prematurely. On May 5th of the 17th year of the Republic of China, the defendant gave birth to a</p>
<p>Boy named Duansheng in</p>
<p>the Jiaxing Gospel Hospital. After the full moon, he still moved back</p>
<p>to Fengjing to live, and the defendant often went to Shanghai, and his whereabouts became increasingly secretive. On May 24th of the 19th year of the Republic of China, the defendant suddenly entrusted lawyer Yang Changchi to send letters one after another, requesting to divorce the self-plaintiff. At that time, thinking of the love of the couple and their legitimate son Duansheng, he hoped to restore the relationship. Unexpectedly, in the first month of the 20th year of the Republic of China, the defendant's brother Xu Renji went to Fengjing and invited the self-plaintiff to go to Shanghai together. When he arrived, he was taken to the Da Zhonghua Hotel by many people, and the defendant, together with lawyer Yang Changchi and assistant Huang Zongqi, were already present. Xu Renji, the defendant's brother, spoke on behalf of the defendant, saying that because of disagreements, they had to divorce and forced him to go to Yang's law firm to</p>
<p>Sign a divorce contract</p>
<p>(details in the attached contract for review at the hearing). On January 27th of the same year, he paid the defendant 200 yuan in foreign currency and lawyer Pu 50 yuan in foreign currency. He was also successively extorted for 1,000 yuan in maintenance fees. Afterwards, the defendant took the self-plaintiff's legitimate son Duansheng and hid him somewhere, with no news. Unexpectedly, the defendant recently changed his name to Hu Xu and used the name of a couple to accuse her husband Hu Bingheng of fraudulent marriage and seduction in the court, claiming that on March 28th of the 15th year of the Republic of China, he</p>
<p>Married Hu Bing at the Far East Hotel in Shanghai</p>
<p>. Red candles were burning high, and a formal wedding ceremony was held. He had been living with Hu for seven years and had two sons and two daughters. Now, because he was abandoned by Hu, he accused the court and attached a civil action for 50,000 yuan in foreign currency (Criminal Case No. 490 in the 20th year of the Republic of China). The self-accusation was rejected by the court, and the defendant appealed to the civil court of the court to confirm his identity as a wife and demanded compensation of 100,000 yuan in foreign currency (Civil Case No. 1143 in the 20th year of the Republic of China), all of which are on record. It is found that since the defendant married Hu Bingheng at the Far East Hotel in Shanghai on March 28th of the 15th year of the Republic of China, why did he marry the self-plaintiff at the Cangzhou Hotel in Hangzhou on March 20th of the lunar calendar in the 16th year of the Republic of China? The defendant</p>
<p>Married more than two people</p>
<p>and obviously used fraud to deceive the marriage and take the self-plaintiff's gifts and silver to obtain illegal property. Although the defendant and the self-plaintiff divorced on January 22nd of the 20th year of the Republic of China, the defendant still demanded 1,000 yuan in maintenance fees, which shows that the defendant is accustomed to using fraudulent marriage to deceive men, forcing them to sign illegal contracts to compensate for losses and pay maintenance fees. The defendant also extorted large sums of money from Hu Bingheng with the self-plaintiff's son, intending to profit, and deprived the self-plaintiff of his parental rights. The facts of his actions have already violated the criminal law. Item 2 of the divorce contract between the defendant and the self-plaintiff clearly states that the young child Duansheng is to be raised by the self-plaintiff, and the defendant (formerly named Zhongyi, now changed to Jiping) designates a location and sends someone to supervise. From the date of signing, the self-plaintiff will pay 30 yuan per month for living expenses before Duansheng is five years old, 20 yuan per month from five to thirteen years old, and the corresponding expenses for middle school from thirteen to sixteen years old. Item 3: Li Shao (self-plaintiff) will pay the wet nurse's salary of 200 yuan in foreign currency to Duansheng within ten days from the date of signing. Item 4: Li Shao will pay Zhongyi 1,000 yuan in maintenance fees within twenty days from the date of signing. Item 6: Duansheng will be raised by Li Shao after the age of sixteen and has nothing to do with Zhongyi. Item 7: If any party violates the above conditions of this contract, they are willing to compensate 10,000 yuan in foreign currency for breach of contract. The above contract conditions clearly state that Duansheng is the self-plaintiff's legitimate son. Today, the defendant denies</p>
<p>Duansheng was born to Ye</p>
<p>and insists that he was born to Hu Bingheng</p>
<p>and said that marrying the self-plaintiff was all instigated by Hu, etc. The defendant's words are contradictory, and they are false statements. One woman has two husbands, and one son has two fathers. Marriage is like a children's play, and tearing down is her usual trick. Eating in the east and sleeping in the west, changing allegiances, men are supplied and headed, and children are placed in rare commodities. Such reversal,</p>
<p>Zhang is an illusion</p>
<p>, all of which are to knock everywhere and hope to gain illegal benefits. The defendant extorts Hu Bingheng with the self-plaintiff's legitimate son, intending to profit, and deprives the self-plaintiff of his parental rights. According to what he has done, he has actually violated the criminal law, etc., and filed a counterclaim against Xu Jiping's lawsuit for endangering life. The first part of the complaint is the same as the self-complaint, and the second part states that Xu Jiping denies that Duansheng was born to Li Shao. In the future, how can he ask for it back? Xu</p>
<p>Used marriage as a fraud</p>
<p>to hide Duansheng for profit</p>
<p>. There is really an extortion of money and abduction of a legitimate son. Therefore, after the court adjourned on July 28th, he sent it to the criminal court to be dealt with. After being tried by the trial judge Fu Lin, Xu confessed that there was no injury, so he was ordered to leave. It can be seen that Li Shao did not use violence or coercion, but only had the fact of going to the criminal court for trial together, so his accusation is groundless. Now that Ye has not coerced, acted violently, or committed a crime, Xu deliberately caused Li Shao to be subject to criminal punishment, which constitutes a crime under Article 180, Section 1. Therefore, according to Article 356 of the Criminal Law, he filed a false accusation.</p>
<p>Xu Jiping did not appear in court</p>
<p>, and Ye Lishao also did not appear because</p>
<p>his brother died and returned to Fengjing to mourn. Therefore, there was no way to try the case, and the court ordered the case to be re-trialed at a later date.</p>

<p>The Ta Mei Wan Bao reported that a Japanese youth named Sasaki, only nineteen years old, claimed to have been misled by detective novels and movies, embarking on a misguided path. He attempted to come to Shanghai, hoping to achieve sudden wealth through criminal activities. Ultimately, he was arrested for alleged extortion and is currently detained at the Japanese Consulate. Initially, on the evening of the first of this month, a Japanese kimono shop at No. 30 Wusong Road received a threatening letter signed "English, American, Indian, Chinese, and Japanese Fox Gang," demanding 200 Japanese yen, wrapped in newspaper, to be placed outside the wall of the Public Works Department Hospital opposite the Japanese Youth Association on Lao Baizi Road at 10 PM the following night. The letter warned against reporting to the police, or the whole family would suffer. The shop owner immediately reported the letter to the Japanese Consulate Police, who dispatched Japanese police to lie in wait nearby. Around 10 PM that night, a Japanese man cautiously approached, looked around, and went straight to the designated location to pick up the money. However, as soon as he grabbed the newspaper package, he was apprehended by the Japanese police. Upon being taken back to the Japanese Consulate, he confessed to writing the threatening letter and admitted to being an extortionist. He also stated that he came with two other young Japanese men because they heard that Shanghai was a haven for criminal activities, where it was easy to quickly become rich through crime. The next day, his two companions were also arrested. They were sentenced to 29 days in prison for failing to register with the Japanese Consulate and will be deported after serving their sentence.</p>
<h3>High Tide in the Huangpu River the Night Before Last</h3>
<p>Reached Thirty-Nine Feet and Four Inches</p>
<p>The recent weather has been severely dry, with strong southeastern winds. Cargo ships are afraid of sudden windstorms and dare not risk sailing out of the port. More than five or six hundred ships are anchored within the Songkou area, waiting for the wind to subside before sailing out to sea. The day before yesterday, the Jianghai Customs Office, recognizing signs of a windstorm, ordered customs vessels to Songkou to tow the ships stationed at the Taiwan forts (commonly known as "yellow boats") to Shanghai to avoid the storm. However, the recent tides have been quite high. The night tide the night before last reached thirty-nine feet and four inches. If it rises another half a foot, the tragic scenes of last year at Hengsha, Yawo Sha, and other places will be repeated. Fortunately, the tide receded. Yesterday's tide was reduced to thirty-seven feet. According to customs officials, this windstorm may be avoided.</p>
<h3>Bandits Extort a Huge Sum of Money Using Classified Ads</h3>
<p>Stating That One Yuan Represents One Thousand Gold</p>
<p>Publicly Giving Receipts Upon Receiving the Money</p>
<p>A Male and Female Bandit Have Been Arrested One After Another</p>
<p>The Peisheng Iron Factory at No. 734 Zhoujiazui Road is owned by Chen Zhisheng from Ningbo. On the 26th of last month, he received a threatening letter signed by the "Third Route Seventh Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Communist Party." The letter contained strong words, demanding 100,000 yuan. It stated that if the demand was met, an advertisement should be placed in the Shen Bao's "Lost and Found" section, stating, "I, the undersigned, lost a black leather bag on Minli Road. If anyone finds it, please send it to the Chen family at No. 2775 Gonghe Road, and a reward will be given," etc. Chen reported this to the Huishan Police Station, which instructed him to publish the letter the next day to observe the situation. On the 30th, he received a second letter, stating that the advertisement should be changed to indicate that 100 yuan was offered as a reward. This was a hidden code indicating a reduction (i.e., one yuan represents one thousand). Calculating 100,000 yuan as the standard, Chen reported the letter to the police again. On the 31st, he received another letter, instructing him to publish another advertisement, stating that a reward of five yuan would be given to anyone who returned the leather bag, indicating the lowest amount, agreeing to 5,000 gold. On the 1st of this month, he received another letter stating, "Our party has investigated and found that your assets total 2 million. The current advertisement offering 5,000 yuan is too little and must be changed to offer 10 yuan as a reward (i.e., 10,000 yuan)," etc. The next day, he received another letter, requesting that the money be sent to Mr. Shi at the Shunxintang Opium Cessation Center at No. 3 Hua'an Lane, North Zhejiang Road, at 3 PM the day before yesterday, and someone would come to receive it. This location was under the jurisdiction of the Fourth District of the Chinese area. Chen reported the situation to the police station. The police chief dispatched detectives Qi Mengqing, Xu Bingnan, Shen Binkui, Wang Yubin, and others in disguise to secretly monitor the location, while detective Xu acted as Chen's representative, packaging old paper to resemble 8,000 yuan and writing "Shi Received" on it. After some time, a Ningbo woman named Ye Wu slowly approached and asked detective Xu if he was sent by the Chen family from No. 734 Zhoujiazui Road. Detective Xu replied in the affirmative. The woman asked if Mr. Shi was present. The woman said she could speak for him. Detective Xu then said that they had only raised 8,000 yuan of the requested 10,000 yuan, and asked if that would be acceptable. The woman replied that a smaller amount could be discussed and that Mr. Shi would provide a receipt tomorrow. She then reached out to receive the package but was immediately arrested by detective Xu and the others. A receipt with Shi's name was found on her person. She confessed that she lived at No. 31 Laian Lane, Baoshan Road. The detectives went to search her residence but found nothing else. She confessed to the identity of her accomplice. The detectives went to the opium cessation center at No. 3 Hua'an Lane, where Yin Xurong resided. The detectives also brought him in for questioning and took them all to the police station, where they were detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Fourth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police station's lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, detailed the previous events and submitted the threatening letters and the receipt found on the woman, requesting an extension for investigation. Subsequently, Chen Zhisheng and the detectives from the police station explained the situation. When questioned, Ye Wu confessed that she had known Shi Laisheng for four years, and they had met at a small vegetable market. He handed her a note, instructing her to go to A'Tai's place (Yin Xurong) at No. 3 Hua'an Lane, saying that a friend had sent a package containing ten yuan, and asked her to pick it up. She offered evasive answers. Yin Xurong confessed that he knew Shi and Ye, and Shi told him that a friend would be sending an item for him to temporarily hold, and that he did not know the details, pleading for leniency. Judge Fu Lin reviewed the confessions and ordered them to be remanded for further investigation and questioning at a later date.</p>

<h3>Old Steel Scrap from Artillery Shell Heads Explodes</h3>
<p>In the open space opposite the Huashang Electric Company on Chezhan Qian Road in Nanshi, around 3 PM yesterday, an artillery shell exploded, causing a loud noise that startled nearby residents. The squad leader of the detective team stationed at the train station, Liu Shaoxiang, along with detectives Wang Songlin, Li Xiaobao, Zhou Jizhen, and others, went to investigate. They saw a man, appearing to be a peddler, about 50 years old, wandering around the open space, looking flustered. Upon questioning, he identified himself as Zhu Xingtai, a 54-year-old Shandong native residing at No. 327 Bansongyuan Road, who worked as a scrap collector. He claimed that he had recently collected old steel scrap resembling artillery shell heads from garbage collectors in Xipao. Fearing it was dangerous.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>Therefore, he tried to detonate it here. (No one was injured.) Liu Shaoqing, together with authorities, brought him to his residence and confiscated fifteen empty artillery shell heads and three artillery shell tips with undetonated fuses, which were extremely dangerous. Therefore, he and the artillery shell casings were taken to the Second District Headquarters of the Municipal Public Security Bureau for questioning.</p>
<h3>Case of Shipmates Fighting with Police Officers</h3>
<p>Started with Gambling; Police Officer Missing</p>
<p>Around 8:40 PM the night before last, two stone-carrying boats anchored in the Huangpu River in Wusong. The crew members on board were gambling and arguing with each other. The patrol boat of the Fourth Public Squad of the Municipal Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol team learned of this and immediately intervened. Seeing gambling paraphernalia on board, they stopped the crew from arguing and prohibited gambling. However, an argument broke out, and the crew members suddenly clashed with the Water Patrol team officers. Only officers Liu Yulun and Zhou Shutang were on the patrol boat. Seeing that they were outnumbered, officer Liu fled to the patrol boat and sailed back to the team headquarters to report. Patrol Officer Pan Xutong dispatched officers to arrest those involved on the ships. However, only two children were left on the two ships. The rest of the crew had disappeared. Officer Zhou Shutang was also nowhere to be found. Later, six crew members involved in the incident were captured on another small boat. They were taken to the team for questioning. The six crew members, Xing A'ao, Wu Dalin, Wu Helin, Guo Jinglin, Zhang Yuanqing, and Chen A'li, confessed that they had indeed fought because of gambling. Regarding the disappearance of officer Zhou Shutang, they remained silent. Around 9:40 PM that evening, police officers on patrol at No. 5 Waitan Road, Seventh District of Public Security, saw two crew members landing ashore, one named Wu A'tu and the other named Chen A'cai, carrying officer's Jiu Long belt and bullets. They were taken to the station. After questioning by the district chief, they confessed that they were playing cards on the ship when the Water Patrol team came to arrest gamblers. The bullets were left behind by the officer. At the time, the Water Patrol team realized that the two crew members must have been involved in the incident and sent a letter to the Seventh District to retrieve them for questioning. They were indeed the crew members involved in the incident. Now that the bullets have been found, it should be possible to find out the whereabouts of officer Zhou Shutang. After Patrol Officer Pan's strict interrogation, Chen A'cai confessed that the bullets had indeed fallen during the scuffle between the two sides, and that the box cannon, fearing it had fallen into the river, had been lost. As for the officer's disappearance, they really did not know anything. After reviewing the confessions, Patrol Officer Pan sent all the captured crew members to the General Team yesterday afternoon. As for officer Zhou Shutang, fearing that he was beaten and had fallen into the river and died, the matter would be handled after further investigation.</p>
<h3>Daytime Robbery and Shooting on Zhaojia Road, Shanghai; Victim Wounded</h3>
<p>Stray Bullet Injures Passerby</p>
<p>A local woman named Zhu Yu, 39 years old, lived on Jiaxilan Road, west of the Lujiawan Bridge in the French Concession. She had been setting up a fish stall at the Xiaodongmen vegetable market for years. Because she was frugal by nature, she had accumulated some savings. However, being a woman, she lacked common sense and was too vain, liking to wear jewelry. This attracted the attention of robbers. At 11 AM yesterday morning, she closed her stall at the vegetable market and returned home. While passing near Chiasheng Lane on Xueyuan Road, Zhaojia Road, in the Chinese area of Nanshi, two robbers suddenly rushed out of the crowd. One robber held a gun and warned her not to make a sound. The other robber snatched the gold chain around her neck and tried to escape with the loot. She shouted "Catch the robbers!" Passersby gathered upon hearing the shouts. The robbers became anxious and fired two shots at her. One bullet hit her left cheek without penetrating it, and the other bullet hit a passerby wearing a white short-sleeved shirt and pants in the back, penetrating through the front abdomen. Both fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. The police officers from the Second Station of the First District arrived and the robbers had already fled. The police transported the woman to the Guangci Hospital on Kimpu Road in the French Concession for treatment. The injured passerby, named Jiang Genbao, 37 years old, from Suzhou, lived at No. 35 Diandang Lane in the French Concession and worked as a musician. He was currently unemployed. He was transported to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. It was said that the injury was in a vital area and his condition was critical.

<h3>Police Officer Commits Adultery with Another Man's Wife</h3>
<p>Police File Charges of Obstructing Family</p>
<p>Yu Xidu, a native of Wuxi and an employee of the Mengyuan Hotel on Hankou Road, married Zhang Baoshi's daughter, Gui Feng, in the 16th year of the Republic of China (1928), through a matchmaker. They lived together for several years and were considered harmonious. However, last year, Yu and Zhang suddenly eloped. Later, Yu discovered that his wife was having an affair with Sun Chengji, a native of Zhili who was a Chinese police officer No. 1549 at the Hongkou Police Station. They lived together in a house at No. 3496 Zhoujiazui Road, as if they were husband and wife. Yu filed a lawsuit with the First Special District Court, accusing Yu and Zhang of adultery. However, the court ruled that according to the Criminal Law, a formal spouse could not file a lawsuit and advised him to request the Public Works Department to handle the matter according to the law. Yu reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station and presented evidence, requesting prosecution. The police chief approved the prosecution and requested the court to issue a summons. Yesterday morning, Chinese Detective Yao Jiawei was dispatched to bring Sun and Yu Zhang to the Second Criminal Court. Judge Wu Tingqi questioned them. Yu Zhang had become pregnant after the affair and gave birth a week ago. Therefore, when she arrived in court, her head was wrapped in gauze, her face was pale, and she was holding a newborn baby, standing in the defendant's dock. Sun Chengji hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend him. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated that he was prosecuting the defendant for obstructing the family under Article 256 of the Criminal Law and recounted the case. Yu Xidu then stated that he was 26 years old and lived at No. 20 Wende Lane, Aiwenyi Road. Yu Zhang was his legal wife. She was currently 20 years old, born in the Year of the Ox, on the 22nd day of the 11th month of the lunar calendar, with the nickname Gui Feng. She was engaged at the age of 14 and the wedding was held in Wuxi on the 16th day of the first month of the lunar calendar in the 17th year of the Republic of China (1928). Jin Fa and Feng Zhang were matchmakers at the time and had arrived in court. He presented a birth chart and requested a strict investigation. Yu Zhang then claimed that Yu Xidu was not her husband. She was 23 years old this year, born in the Year of the Dog, on the 23rd day of the 11th month of the lunar calendar. She had been living with Yu for three years when she was 19 years old. The matchmakers Yu Jinfa and Feng Zhang proved that Yu Zhang was Yu's legal wife and they were the matchmakers. Zhang Baoshi, 51 years old, stated that Yu Zhang was her biological daughter and was engaged to Yu at 14 and had the marriage with Yu Xidu. Her girl was born in the Year of the Ox and is 20 years old this year. Yu Zhang then claimed that Zhang Baoshi was actually her stepmother who adopted her at 7 years old and was sold to Yu for 96 yuan when 19, also denying knowing the two matchmakers. When questioned, Sun Chengji testified that he took Zhang as his wife on August 13 of last year for 110 yuan of tea money from Peng. At the time, Peng said that Zhang was his wife and he had let her go with him because he could no longer afford to support her. Lee Hongguo’s girl has testified for her, I really didn’t know Zhang had a former husband.” When questioned, Yu Zhang confessed that she had lived with Yu Xidu, but because Yu forced her to go out to work and she refused and was beaten and kicked out. She went to work at the new Kang Yarn Factory in Yangshupu and met Peng’s sister-in-law, and then cohabitated with Peng for four months. Because Peng could not support her, she was sold to Sun and charged 110 yuan of tea money, etc. Judge Wu reviewed the confessions and ordered Sun to provide a deposit of 1,000 yuan and Yu Zhang was to be on call; the case was adjourned for seven days.</p>

<h3>Letters</h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>Regarding the news about the Iron Blood Traitor Gang published in your newspaper on the 4th of this month, it stated that the Coal Industry Association discovered a hand grenade from the Iron Blood Gang, which was a roll of round paper with "Shanghai Coal Industry Association" written on the outside and "Sent by the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau" signed below. This action is obviously a misuse of our name, attempting to confuse people. In the future, if there are similar news items involving our bureau, please record them carefully.</p>

<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>According to the parties concerned, the Public Security Bureau investigator Shen Bin came to state that on the 2nd of this month, he read the Shanghai news on the fourth page of your newspaper, which contained "Two Reports of Extortion in the Assassination Case," which was inconsistent with the facts. I am indeed a Public Security Bureau investigator and hold Public Security Bureau employee certificate No. 372, issued by Director Wen and stamped on June 29 of this year, and am a formal employee, not an imposter. As for going to the Small World, it was to investigate the murderer and was a secret investigation ordered by the Bureau, and there was no extortion. I have specially entrusted this lawyer to handle it legally and to send a letter of correction.</p>
<p>Therefore, I am writing to your newspaper office to check and request that this letter be published tomorrow for correction.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>In yesterday's issue of your newspaper, a report was published about the strike at the Tiangzhuang Paper Mill in Pudong. The factory management agreed to increase wages in November, based on performance and responsibility. Your newspaper reported that wages would be increased starting in October, which is likely a misunderstanding. Also, the manager of our factory is Di Zhaolin, not Geng Shaolin. Liu Yuanshi was mistakenly written as Liu Yingzhi.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>I have just read your newspaper's Shanghai news column. It was stated that my lawyer is the legal advisor to Kuo Luman's in an article about a marital dispute involving Guo Luman. This is inaccurate, this lawyer is the legal advisor to Kuo Luman's father and brother Guo Yonglan and Guo Xuexiang. During the reconciliation discussions that day, he represented and assisted Guo's family members in the meeting, and there were no discussions at my office until 2:30 AM.</p>

<h3>The Tenth World Games, Day Five</h3>
<p>Pole Vault Creates Astonishing Result</p>
<p>American Athlete Achieves New World Record of 4.315 Meters</p>
<p>Women's 80-Meter Hurdles at 11.8 Seconds Also a World Record</p>
<p>Black Athlete Tolan Wins 200-Meter Championship Again in 21.2 Seconds</p>
<p>The Tenth World Olympic Games have reached their fifth day. The increased excitement of the track and field events has attracted the attention of the entire world. The creation of new records is almost commonplace, emerging endlessly. Some say that this conference is nothing less than an exhibition of new track and field records. These words are indeed not an exaggeration. Almost all previous records have been shattered, and even newer world records have been set. On the third day, two world records were created: (1) In the pole vault, American athlete Miller achieved an astonishing result of 4.315 meters; (2) In the first heat of the women's 80-meter hurdles, the time was 11.8 seconds, and in the second heat, it was exactly 12 seconds. Other new records set at the games are too numerous to mention. Athletes from various countries are striving to set new records, making it the center of competition and the focus of their efforts. Seeing the activity of athletes from other countries, and the crushing defeat of our own Liu Changchun, should inspire our countrymen to be vigilant and strive for self-improvement.</p>
<p>A National News Agency dispatch from Los Angeles on the 3rd reports that the American black athlete Tolan from Michigan, champion of the 100-meter race, today won the 200-meter championship again in 21.2 seconds. This not only set a new Olympic record, but also represents an unprecedented speed for 200 meters on a circular track. The black athlete can be said to have proudly raised his eyebrows and shown off his skills in this World Games. Second place went to Simpson of the United States, and third place went to Metcalfe, a black athlete from Chicago. Fourth was Jonas of Germany, fifth was Luchi of Argentina, and sixth was Walters of South Africa.</p>
<p>In the 110-meter hurdles, Selin, an American from Ohio, won the championship with a time of 14.6 seconds. However, Selin's personal record was 14.1 seconds, so this was not his best performance. Second place went to Piat of the New York Athletic Association, and third place went to Keller, also an American from Ohio. Findlay of England finished fourth, Bushel of England finished fifth, and Welscher of Germany finished sixth.</p>
<p>In the pole vault, Americans also took the lead. Miller of Stanford University set a new world record of 14 feet, 1 and 7/8 inches. Nishida of Japan finished second with 14 feet, Jefferson of the United States finished third, Glaber of the United States finished fourth, Saki of Japan finished fifth, and de Castro of Brazil finished sixth. The previous Olympic record was 13 feet, 9 and 3/8 inches, and the world record was 14 feet, 1 and 1/2 inches.</p>
<p>In the discus throw final, Anderson, a former student at Cornell University, won the championship with a throw of 160 feet, 4 and 7/8 inches. The previous Olympic record was 155 feet, 2 and 15/16 inches. Labut of Stanford University finished second, Winter of France finished third, Noel of France finished fourth, Dinigan of Hungary finished fifth, and Madach of Hungary finished sixth. Ye Suopu of Washington had previously set a world record of 168 feet, 8 and 7/8 inches, but only threw 148 feet, 5 and 1/4 inches this time, leading to his elimination. Opportunity favors those who are prepared.</p>

<h3>Preliminary Assessment of the Sixth Day of the Games</h3>
<p>Interest Concentrated on 400 Meters and Javelin</p>
<p>(A Telecommunications Agency dispatch from Los Angeles on the 3rd) The Olympic Games, the fourth day of the event and the sixth day since the opening, are increasingly tense. In addition to holding the finals for the javelin, triple jump, and 1,500 meters, the preliminary rounds and semi-finals for the 400 meters will also be held.</p>
<p>The contenders for the 400-meter championship are likely to be Eastman (USA), Rambling (England), Landell (Canada), and Salirlas (Chile). In addition, Liu Changchun (China), Nishi Teiichi (Japan), Gallini (Italy), Aelikusen (Sweden), Maldan (Switzerland), Johallersen (Norway), Mitzler (Germany), and Nakajima Haitaro (Japan) all have hopes of being selected. The Olympic record for the 400 meters was set by American Brucei at the Amsterdam Games with a time of 47 seconds. However, with American athlete Eastman, who has a world record of 46.2 seconds, it is expected that he will set a new record this time.</p>
<p>In the triple jump, Oda Mikio (Japan), who won first place last time and has a world-recognized record, has been injured in his foot since spring and has not fully recovered. He no longer has the spirit of the previous time (when he won the championship) and is likely to fall to second place or below. Moreover, athletes from various countries, especially Wasselli (Italy), Pieters (Netherlands), Sensten (Sweden), Klee (USA), Alvillion (Finland), and Hochland (Norway), have made considerable progress and are also expected to set new records.</p>
<p>In the javelin, Sweden and Finland have a tendency to divide the world. Swedish athlete Rutguni set a world record at the previous games. This year, Finnish athlete Alchenliam is a candidate for the championship. Japan has two athletes participating, Sumiyoshi Kosaku and Nagao Saburo, with Sumiyoshi having a good chance of being selected.</p>
<p>Other events, such as wrestling, will begin in the Greco-Roman style, and the pentathlon will hold a shooting competition, all of which are new and interesting.</p>

<h3>Only Do, Don't Speak</h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>Yesterday's talk on [Only Do, Don't Speak] was in response to several readers' questions. Today's topic is also this, but the nature is different. We'll discuss the principles of [Only Do, Don't Speak], so there's no continuity.</p>
<p>[Only Do, Don't Speak] originally has two meanings. If we speak from an evil aspect, this is originally wrong. If we speak from a good aspect, [Only Do, Don't Speak] is originally the most valuable action and the most effective method. Silently working hard will naturally lead to great achievements.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the way Chinese people do things is often [barking before they shit]. They blow their own trumpets first, but ultimately achieve nothing. If they can change their approach and use the [Only Do, Don't Speak] method, working hard in a down-to-earth manner, it will definitely be like a panacea in a pharmacy, with unexpected effectiveness.</p>
<p>Especially for patriotic actions organized by patriotic groups, it is even more important to calm the mind, breathe quietly, and do things step by step. For example, the volunteer army of Ma Zhanshan in the Northeast, they never blew their own trumpets first, but they still persist in the White Mountains and Black Waters. This is nothing more than the great achievement of [Only Doing, Don't Speaking].</p>

<h3>Four Ancient Poems</h3>
<p>— Bai Jiao</p>
<p>A man says he has tears, but does not shed them for personal matters.</p>
<p>Many drinkers are depressed, while optimists only write poems.</p>
<p>Sorrow comes like a sudden rain, singing and crying are inappropriate.</p>
<p>We share this moon at the ends of the earth, my thoughts drift on and on.</p>
<p>································</p>
<p>The deep oath is in the river, a sword cannot cut the thread.</p>
<p>Words of entanglement in a dream, thousands of miles away, we cannot know each other.</p>
<p>Who says we dream the same dreams? Even dreams have discrepancies.</p>
<p>Alas, fellow minds, how can we bear a long separation?</p>
<p>Better to be like willow catkins in spring, letting the wind take us where it will.</p>
<p>································</p>
<p>On the day we met in the past, I always feared the time of separation.</p>
<p>Separation is something to be missed, everywhere it becomes longing.</p>
<p>We held hands and promised to grow old together, tears flowed uncontrollably.</p>
<p>We comforted each other with meager words, but comfort turned to sadness.</p>
<p>My parents loved me to the end, perhaps they will remember their foolish child.</p>
<p>································</p>
<p>The black wind comes from the north, parting ways like paired birds.</p>
<p>This makes one like Shen, the other like Shang, their talents are all remote from each other.</p>
<p>Occasionally there are rumors, but the news is difficult to discern.</p>
<p>Who is that person in the painting? My heart is marked by it.</p>
<p>How noisy is the market, how quiet is my heart.</p>
<p>How can I say my heart is quiet? Sorrow cannot be stopped.</p>
<p>How bright is the moonlight, shining on my lonely shadow on the mountain.</p>
<p>································</p>
<p>The woman has no other heart, the man acts without hesitation.</p>
<p>The woman at the east gate is like a flower, I visit her three times a month.</p>
<p>She gives me embroidered silk, comforts me with plain words.</p>
<p>How can I not remember her kindness? Her words also contain my ambition.</p>
<p>The year is cold with clouds and frost, but the pines and cypresses are always different.</p>
<p>Alas, I miss the person far away, I have nowhere to send my sorrow.</p>
<p>The bright moon is round again, my heart is always drunk.</p>

<h3>How to Keep a Thermos Bottle at a Constant Temperature</h3>
<p>— Qing</p>
<p>When boiling water or ice water is placed in ordinary containers, the temperature will equalize with the outside temperature in a short period of time. As a result, the boiling water will decrease in temperature, and the ice water will increase in temperature, becoming similar to the outside temperature. This fact has long been proven to us! Given this, it is very difficult for us to store hot water in icy weather or ice water in hot weather! Because of this difficulty, everyone started thinking and attacking this difficulty, and finally, the thermos bottle was invented! Now, almost every household has one, and it has become a daily necessity! We benefit from it in more ways than one or two. This is all thanks to the inventor, Dewar! We cannot invent like him, but we should at least understand its principles! Therefore, I specifically wrote about it below...</p>
<p>There are usually three ways to transfer heat: (1) Conduction. It can cause the temperature inside and outside the container to be conducted through the container wall to an average temperature; like iced soda, this is how it works. (2) Convection. It can cause two objects with different temperatures to have a mutual flow, with the high temperature flowing to the low temperature, and the low temperature flowing to the high temperature. This flow continues incessantly and will soon equalize the temperature of the two objects; like boiling water and starting a fire, this is how it works.</p>
<p>(3) Radiation. There is a type of heat that is often radiated in light. It can also equalize the temperature of two objects with different temperatures; like sunbathing or sitting in front of a fire, you will feel a kind of heat. This is definitely not caused by [conduction] or [convection], but by another kind of action, which is called [radiation].</p>
<p>With these three actions, the temperature of the liquid in ordinary containers will gradually equalize with the outside temperature, so it is difficult to store heat or cold. The structure of the thermos bottle is to resist these three actions. It is made of double-layered silver-plated glass panels. In the middle of the two layers, the air is extracted to create a vacuum (the pointed end at the bottom is the trace of air extraction). Because the vacuum and glass panels can resist the [first] and [second] actions, the bright silver color will reflect external light, which can resist the [radiation] action. In this simple way, the three heat transfer actions are resisted! Therefore, when boiling water or ice water is placed inside, it can isolate the outside temperature, and there is no worry about the temperature equalizing with the outside temperature in a short period of time and losing its normal temperature! As for the metal shell on the outside, it is used to protect the glass, and the side effect is decoration.</p>

<p>— Shuxia</p>
<p>The owner of Yiyi Pavilion published the issue of [Improving Dining Habits] in this journal. His intention is roughly to change from [communal dining] to [individual dining].</p>
<p>The advantages and disadvantages of communal and individual dining are probably clear to the readers, so there is no need to go into detail here. However, I believe it is unacceptable to change the form and also change its essence.</p>
<p>The greatest danger of communal dining is that everyone's chopsticks and spoons are washed together, which easily transmits diseases. To improve this, someone has already improved and implemented it, that is, preparing two sets of chopsticks and spoons, one for taking vegetables and one for eating. I say that this kind of improvement is not only troublesome and easy to get tangled, but also probably still of no benefit in preventing transmission, because if one is used to take vegetables and one is used to eat, it is difficult for germs to directly enter the mouth, but isn't it the same as indirect transmission? As for sacrificing all the benefits of communal dining in order to improve this kind of transmission and completely change to European and American-style individual dining, this kind of improvement is either close to abandoning eating due to choking or similar to blindly following.</p>
<p>You should know that the reason why communal and individual dining have been able to maintain themselves for thousands of years without fundamental changes is actually due to the differences in the stomachs of Europeans, Asians, and Japanese, and the force of habit. At the same time, each principle has its own advantages and disadvantages. The advantages naturally suit the taste and become more and more appropriate, and the disadvantages are not felt to be inappropriate due to habit. For example, if people who eat noodles are suddenly forced to eat rice forever, even if there are delicious dishes on the table, it may be difficult to suit their taste. People who eat rice every day and eat Western food will also have their taste overturned. This is something that everyone can know. As for the layer of eating several dishes together and eating several dishes separately that people do not pay attention to, I think the relationship between advantages and disadvantages is most worth discussing. According to Chinese cuisine, there are different methods of stir-frying, braising, boiling, cooking, and grilling, and there are also different flavors of sour, sweet, bitter, spicy, and salty at different times. When eating several dishes together, the amount and five flavors can be arranged and adjusted by the diners at will, taking more or less. There is actually a kind of indescribable chemical effect in it. This is the essence of Chinese-style eating several dishes together and having to eat together, which is by no means comparable to Western-style eating several dishes separately, and it is even less comparable to a non-Chinese and non-Western system of eating one soup and one dish separately. (Note: Chinese banquets have many dishes that are not eaten together, which is extremely unsanitary.) As for improving the transmission of diseases, I think it is extremely easy. You only need to transform the bowls and basins for serving soup and vegetables. The method is to divide each bowl and basin into unequal or equal grids of eight or ten when manufacturing, like a fruit plate. (The general rule for eating is eight people per table, and ten grids are used for round table banquets.) The size of the bowl and basin is the same as the one usually used, and can be slightly enlarged. When cooking, you can put the vegetables in the bowl and basin according to the size of the grid, putting in more or less of the vegetables according to the grid size. If the grids are the same size, the amount of vegetables put in is the same. To be more economical, you can also estimate how many people will be eating before the meal, and put the vegetables in the number of grids. The people who are eating then take the vegetables from the grid. Why use unequal grids? Because the number and amount of people at a family table are different, and their tastes and preferences cannot be forced to be the same. Unequal grids are convenient for each person to choose and adjust their taste. Why use equal grids? Because in schools and factories, there is not much difference in the age and needs of people, so it is appropriate to distribute food evenly to avoid disputes. This principle of communal separation and communal eating is both hygienic and more economical than Western-style and Chinese food. I sincerely hope that readers will quickly improve this. Any suggestions for correction are welcome!</p>
<h3>After Answering the Letter from the Society Improvement Discussion Group</h3>
<p>— Siwei</p>
<p>Regarding Huai Jingcheng's suggestion on improving men's and women's clothing published in Shen Bao on July 25 of the 21st year, and Cheng Peng's discussion on the same issue revealed in the supplement on August 1, the former is indeed as Cheng Peng said, [I think Chinese people already have enough strange appearances, so there is no need to create new patterns]. The latter, I dare not deeply agree with.</p>
<p>Whether Peng is a soldier or not, whether sociology is worthy of being talked about by soldiers, that is something everyone knows. If he is a soldier, speaking about the military, self-praise is vanity, and self-abandonment is shameful. It is said that [an American reporter once saw Commander-in-Chief Jiang wearing a Zhongshan suit, and the reporter published in an interview that Jiang's attire was very similar to that of a waiter in a cafe]. May I ask, my dearest Peng, where is your country? Who are you? Since Peng looks at people wearing Zhongshan suits in the eyes of American reporters as being very similar to waiters in cafes, could it be said that they are not as good as the workers and farmers of Europe and the United States and the beggars wearing suits? I don't understand what Peng means by saying that no new clothes have been created since the Republic of China, and that only Western suits have been temporarily worn. It can be seen that Western suits are deeply ingrained and easy for people to imitate. Not everyone is like Peng.</p>
<p>As for women's shorts and thin socks, they have good coats to keep them warm. Moreover, doctors have said that the legs will not freeze. The climate in China is not as cold as Alaska. However, the more modern it is, the more modern it will be. In the near future, it is possible to advocate and implement nudity, and the body can also be naked. Cicada wing silk always feels like a layer of separation for studying the beauty of curves. It is better to be naked all over, charming and enchanting in the city. Then, when that era comes, even if I don't kill Boren, Boren will die because of me.</p>
<p>School Photos</p>
<h3>Sketches of Summer School</h3>
<p>— Manqian</p>
<p>I say, [Summer school is the paradise of rich kids.] Because poor children usually can't afford the tuition, let alone the cost of a month in summer school. Of course, it will cost the rich kids more than that.</p>
<p>On the bulletin board of the teaching affairs office, various course textbooks were posted. Now I'll just talk about their prices: chemistry eight yuan, mathematics seven yuan, bookkeeping five yuan... Ah! I really don't understand. In a short month, buying these thick books at such a high price, I don't know how many pages can be taught? That's right! I forgot, rich kids have money!</p>
<p>This is part of the teachers inside... Originally, the director of affairs is now teaching English, and Mr. Wang, who teaches history, is also teaching English, while the physical education instructor is teaching chemistry. So this kind of forced work is nothing more than the economic policy of the principal, which saves the trouble of hiring other people. Although this kind of homework is not their specialty, they are trying it out reluctantly for the sake of money! Fortunately, there is one month.</p>
<p>The physical education instructor said this in the first chemistry class: [Because I am afraid that there will not be enough time to finish this book of more than 400 pages, the experimental part inside is generally omitted to speed it up!] Of course, the director of affairs and Mr. Wang, who teaches history, also said the same thing in their first class!</p>
<p>Summer is the hottest time of the year, so watermelon peels are all over the ground, and soda bottles are rolling around; in the student dormitories of summer schools, this situation can be seen at any time! This is what shows the wealth of the students!</p>
<h3>Accusation of Six Unfilial Acts</h3>
<p>— Shi·Ben·</p>
<p>My relative, Mr. Shen, had a good birth, and his ancestors left behind a lot of inheritance. In addition, he has been in charge of the family until now. In the past 20 years, his methods have been flexible and his work has been stable and agile, so he has added more than 100,000 assets. Counting from head to toe, he can be called a millionaire.</p>
<p>Although he owns so much wealth, he still chases after every penny and is unwilling to spend a small amount of money easily. Sometimes people persuade him, [As a person, living in the world, it is better to enjoy happiness, eat and wear a little. Having such a large property, still doing this kind of life, you can't take it to the coffin when you die.] He replied, [I am not going to be childless, wasting money. I am now saving a little to leave to my children and grandchildren so they can have enough to eat and wear, saving them from complaining about their father in the future.] It turned out that he had two sons and a daughter. The daughter had already married someone. The husband's family was still good at first, but later the son-in-law was useless and ruined the family property, making the daughter's life difficult. She often came back with a sad face and argued with her father, asking for help to make a living. However, he was still a man with an 18th-century mindset, who only valued sons and not daughters. Therefore, when his woman asked him for help, his face would definitely be as stern as iron, and he would say sternly, [A married daughter is like spilled water].</p>
<p>He completely disregarded the father-daughter relationship and was unwilling to pity her at all. No matter how many times you cried and begged, he always insisted on the goal of (a daughter is an outsider) and would not give her a penny. Later, she saw that her father had rejected her request so ruthlessly. She thought that if she didn't resort to legal means, she would never achieve her goal. So she immediately asked someone to start a lawsuit. However, the clan leader in the clan knew about it in advance and thought that the father and daughter had a close relationship and should not break up due to temporary discord and be laughed at by others. So he immediately told her to postpone the action and let the clan leader come forward to mediate. She saw that someone was trying to smooth things over, so she agreed. Who knew that the clan leader ran to tell her father about the situation, advising him to maintain the father-daughter relationship to avoid breaking up and causing a lawsuit. He actually said repeatedly, [Fart, fart, a daughter suing her father, that's outrageous. Hmph, even if she sues the emperor, there are only accusations of five unfilial acts, and no accusations of six unfilial acts. Don't say anything, my money is only good for my sons to use. How can I let her give birth less?] The clan leader was filled with the stench of farts and knew that his mind was confused and difficult to reason with, so he withdrew and watched from the sidelines, quietly watching the father and daughter fight.</p>
<p>After she dismissed the clan leader's responsibility for mediation, she ran to the famous Lawyer X to ask for help. Lawyer X listened to</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>, and said, [Madam! Your goal of asking for help to make a living is too small. Now that men and women are equal, the lady also has the right to enjoy your father's property. Now that you want to sue, you should think big!] Lawyers are most interested in inheritance cases, so they encouraged her in this way.</p>
<p>A month later, the case of the daughter suing the father was decided. According to current law, men and women are equal, and women also have the right to inherit. Naturally, she won the case. However, Mr. Shen, who had an outdated mind, was furious after receiving the judgment of defeat and repeatedly said, [It's outrageous, corrupt officials have come up with this kind of reasoning. If a case of six unfilial acts can be won, people can't raise daughters.]</p>
<p>Family Problems</p>
<h3>A Scene of Tragedy</h3>
<p>— Jin</p>
<p>It was still the summer of the year before last when I went to visit my friends, Mr. Luo and his wife, alone. Mr. Luo was not at home at the time, and only his wife was groaning in pain? You should know that when you are alone facing a patient, you will definitely feel uneasy. If you don't have a better way to deal with this difficulty, then you have to cry with him. Of course, I was really embarrassed at the time, but I didn't have a good reason to leave her suddenly, so I had to sit on the edge of her bed and answer her reluctantly?</p>
<p>[Is it a stomach ache? You are in such pain.] I said?</p>
<p>[Oh... no, I'm having an abortion; I've already taken abortion pills!]</p>
<p>[Oh? Abortion? Why are you doing that!] [Oh! What's there to say? He wanted me to have it done]. Of course, I had to obey him because I didn't have the ability to support my future baby! But... oh! What's there to say, I can only cry... just cry!]</p>
<p>So she cried to her heart's content, holding her face in her hands, her shoulders shaking uncontrollably. At that time, I was completely attacked by her sorrow, and I felt very sad. Every tear of hers hit my heart. And I murmured sadly... [That's right, her husband ordered her to do this, what can she do?] I couldn't hold back my tears. Then I heard her wipe the corners of her eyes and say...</p>
<p>[I've been married to him for almost two years. All he can give me is a perfunctory daily life. For example, he has never taken me to see a movie once, but he goes almost every day. If I intentionally ask him where he went? Of course, he will have many ways to cover it up? From this one end, you can know that he hates me too much. Of course, I know that I am not beautiful, and I am so old. If I must follow him, it will inevitably make him look bad. I love him, I love him very faithfully, why do I have to make him lose face in front of people? But my heart, my heart is really painful. This is something he will never know, and even if he knows, he will never be willing to understand me?... The little life that is about to die in my belly is considered the crystallization of our love for two years, but now he wants to kill him, he has already killed him viciously! But I know that I will always be abandoned by him. I am just waiting for that terrible time to come. Then, why should I keep this child who will have no father to increase my future burden? Oh! How vicious he is! I deeply realize my misfortune.]</p>
<p>When I got home, Mr. Luo's gentle attitude immediately came to my mind. The walking stick, the cigar, and the dashing mustache. But this is how cruel an act it is! I shuddered for their terrible outcome.</p>
<p>X X X X</p>
<p>Exactly two years later, I met Mr. Luo again today. I warmly shook his hand and asked him; [Are you okay?]</p>
<p>[Thank you, very good!]</p>
<p>[How is your wife?] But he paused for a moment before saying... [I think she is still very good now, but; I have divorced her.] I had to remain silent.</p>
