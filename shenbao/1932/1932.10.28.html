<h3 id="c1">菲列濱獨立與日本　又玄 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>菲列濱之獨立本已成爲一舊問題在今日世界風雲中其重要性似已極小。然而現時列强爭霸。歐洲形勢殆成夕陽晚景。於資本主義社會恐無多大發展餘地。惟有太平洋沿岸。無論美國。無論加拿大。無論西比利亞沿海省一帶無論中國各地。强半尚未開發。至多亦不過半開發狀態。其前途之盛。有如方發芽之種子。近之可以調劑世界經濟當前恐慌。遠之足以挽救資本主義未來之頽運。此種特殊利益將以中日美蘇諸國爲其中樞。惜我國此時主觀能力不克控制此客觀形勢。蘇聯亦專心於其國内建設。一時尚難插足於海上爭霸。是以太平洋上之爭霸運動。惟有日美兩國而已。日美之爭執愈烈。則菲列濱之地位愈重要。蓋軍事上彼足爲美華間之鏈鎖。經濟上亦太平洋交通之環扣。於是乎菲島之獨立。在太平洋問題中。遂另生一種新意義矣。</p>
<p>本年四月四日。美國衆議院以三百零六票對四十七票之多數。通過赫雅氏之菲島獨立法案因此曾引起一般輿論之深切注意。其原案内容大體如下、</p>
<p>（一、制定菲列濱憲法建立菲島國民政府八年後之七月四日。美國將撤廢其主權。（但美國以爲憲法之制定。與國民政府之建立。須時二年則菲島獨立應在十年以後。而菲人則急於獨立。擬在一九四零年完成之。）</p>
<p>二、美國主權撤廢之前。菲列濱政府於内政上可完全自治。</p>
<p>三、美國主權完全撤廢之前。美對菲島輸入物品。可免去關稅。但得就輸入額之現狀。加以一定限制。</p>
<p>四、美國主權完全撤廢之前菲島渡美移民年以五十名爲限。</p>
<p>五、美國在菲島之海陸軍根據地。應得維持之并得保留其他之特權。）</p>
<p>美國所以復提菲島獨立之根本原因。一則民主黨得勢。欲踐其成約。再則菲列濱渡美移民增加。促成一新問題。三則菲産砂糖輸入美國。致該處糖業受其影響。是故欲以菲島獨立阻止砂糖之輸入。藉以救濟一部分頽落市面。本届議會。參議院對此問題亦將加以詳密討議。美國一部分人士（民主黨）以爲菲島列濱苟由安定的政治形體而入於獨立。則菲列濱將與中南美諸小共和國同其情勢。旣足避免外界之干涉。又可贏得美國之保護。且美國之傳統政策。與夫美國大多數人民之習慣。亦均以經濟的（安全）發展爲要。務固不必時兵力以决勝負於疆塲也。是故對菲島獨立問題。以爲美國設許其獨立。則可以表明美國對東亞無特殊野心。因此可以促進日本自由主義者之反省。使東三省得而繼起仿效。實行（門户開放）無形中引動日本自戢其野心。則太平洋上日美對立衝突形勢或可因而緩和。於美國實爲莫大之利。　　雖然今日世界列國中。其一切均已達於爛熟時期者。爲英美與法國而已日本雖已長成。較之英美究爲早熟。故尚有餘力足供發展。尤與美國具必爭之勢。故日夜經營以圖一逞。其不顧國際信義。以兵力侵占我東北三省。意在取得豐富資源。據有形勝之地。數年經營之後。將不難驅逐美國在東方之經濟勢力。中國市塲固將爲日本所獨占。即菲列濱羣島亦何難以武力襲取</p>
<p>（自由主義）僅餘殘壘。國際之間。已成爲歷史往蹟。欲求其在帝國主義的段階中復活。且從而解决太平洋爭覇之糾紛。匪特軍國主義狂熟之日本。不肯循此退守軌跡。即痴念於和平運動之美國士紳。亦未必即抛棄其金融資本獨占的優勢。竊恐於經濟恐慌對策必採取更進一步之獨占形態。不過歐美先進國家資力雄厚。物産殷實。對殖民地及半殖民地所取手段。爲經濟的支配。而非軍事的暴力。縱用政治壓迫。亦多不採流血主義。仍主和平。使受者不甚覺其兇猛。而主動之國得享最大利益。日本在資本主義諸國中爲後進。其國内政治仍帶有極濃厚之封建色彩。即經濟組織如三井三菱古河諸大財閥。無不基殖於封建關係。是以其國家權力機關秉此社會基礎。其對外一切政策。自不同於歐美。苟至政治失去絶對作用。經濟陷於窮乏境地。和平的挽救方法一刻不易覓取。則自以爲打開難局之手段最有效最合算者厥爲用兵。故以兵力襲侵東北之後。仍復建艦造砲。圖在太平洋海上一戰而覇也。美國欲於此時以和平方法以菲列濱獨立。使東三省不爲日本所併呑。求得新均勢。未免爲片面的理想。欲仰制日本之軍國主義的侵略捨。以武力裁制之外。實未見有更妥善方法。</p>

<h3 id="c65">西藏最近局勢 <a href="#c65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>西藏遠處西南邊陲、因爲交通不便、所以一切消息、國人知之甚少、茲從各方探詢、得一較詳的報告、以饗國人、</p>
<p>政治西藏向來政權和教權分做兩體、不相關係的、在前清光緒二十一年、教王達賴把政王謨佛監禁起來、收了也的印信、從此政權和教權都在達賴一人之手、當時清政府雖有駐兵在藏、可是腐敗不堪、不經一戰、清兵全部退出、達賴自取了教權和政權後、幾目無中國、外交上獨斷獨行、因爲地勢關係、不得不谄媚於英人、近數年、達賴自覺地位已固、對於英人漸不如從前的谄媚、所以現在的逹賴、實不如昔日的親英、而英亦不如昔日的親達賴、可是一班少數的部下、仍舊獻媚、互相勾結、達賴的政治手腕、完全是圓滑手段、對於英人如此、對於中央亦是如此、一方面派代表常駐中央、一方面却秣馬礪兵、私買軍火、常來侵擾川邊、其所以如此者、因達賴明知中央不暇顧及、達賴的政治、完全是專制政治、教徒對於他、均須以神聖看待、人民對他、應視他如超過一切的皇帝、一言一動、國人遵守母違、因此國民對他、確有敢怒而不敢言的情形、</p>
<p>經濟西藏經濟、因近年來屢受戰爭關係、政府和人民益形竭蹶、川藏戰事、所耗民財、竟達三百萬盧比、五月中敗北、又向英國購五十餘萬的軍械、因此一般商民因苛徵重稅關係、均有坐以待斃之勢、以拉薩一市而言、因受經濟關係而倒閉商店、二月來有五十餘家之多、西藏經濟的竭蹶、近因固由戰爭而起、但遠因實受賜於英人的經濟侵略、藏内出外購物、必須在印换盧比、從前藏銀四元可换一盧比、現在藏銀三十元方可換一盧比、達賴爲收羅現銀起見、製造銅幣、發行紙幣、迫民使用、所以民間的資産僅成銅和紙而已、</p>
<p>軍事西藏的軍隊、現在只有步兵、騎兵和砲兵甚少、步兵大都由民間抽來、很少訓練、其中有五千餘的精練步兵、曾受英俄日人的訓練、這是西藏軍隊的最精銳之部、現駐隆布嶺卡花園、軍械從印度買來、是印度所棄而不用者、最近由英國購來一批新式步槍·機關槍·過山砲、這是對中央頗有不利的表示、軍人所穿制服、都由英國承辦、其式様和顔色完全與英國兵士相同、軍隊所用的旗幟、是一隻獅子、其顔色紅黄藍白黑均有、現在所有的軍隊、約五萬人左右、兵士年齡自十八歲至六十歲、軍人俸給、官長每年除得九百兩蠻銀外、並由達賴賜給田地、如因打仗而死的、死後所賜田地由其子孫承繼、兵士每月除得餉銀四兩外、亦由達賴賜給田地若干、可是死後、雖因打仗而死、所給田地没有承繼者的、令其補缺的兵士承受、</p>
<p>社會西藏以天冷關係、物産甚少、所以一般人民的生活程度、低下不堪、民間的主要食品、不外大麥小麥和青果、上流社會、間或吃米、可是除堆外所産的少數外、大都從印度購進、即以日用品之油鹽而講、亦均從印度運進、魚類以宗教關係、禁止烹食、所以藏内隨地池澤中很有魚滿的現象、婚姻盛行一妻多夫制、女子少、生活苦、是實行此制的大原因、喇嘛多不結婚、達賴本人亦未娶妻、他左右都是年輕的喇嘛、傳聞秘藏女人、可是不敢公開、恐怕失去民衆的信仰、最近達賴有一個心腹、亦是男性、在達賴坐前、很有一言九鼎之勢、</p>
<p>民衆西藏民衆可分、三部分一部分是擁戴班禪的民衆、一部分是擁戴達賴的民衆、還有一部分是紅黄兩教、擁戴班禪的民衆、雖常常盼望班禪回藏、脫離達賴的苛政、可是班禪以勢力不敵、回藏實是一個難題、非中央有斷然處置的方法、實無成就的可能性、</p>
<p>總之、西藏不靖、在我國西南邊陲的糾紛、實無解决辦法、最近中央擬將西藏改爲行省、這是處置西藏的良策、西藏在形式誰是很窮苦、可是實際上、天然的財富、實冠全國、英人所以注意西藏者、乃愛其礦産的雄厚、其礦産的種類、有金銀銅鐵煤等、而且質美量多、某年有日人冒充華人、潛入内地、費了數年的苦心、老察礦物、所採標本、價值百萬餘元、此可見礦産的雄厚了、</p>

<p>鬥字的説文，呌做··兩士相對，兵杖在後，象鬥家形。鬥有種種的鬥，鬥加市，成鬧··鬥加共，成閧··鬥加斷成鬭；鬥加兒成閱；我來模倣拗相公的字説，撰成下文的新字説；</p>
<p>國中要人的鬥意氣，這便適用一個閙字；他們爲着實利主義而大鬧，特閙，見利不見義，大有市儈氣息，所以閙字中間有一個市字。</p>
<p>因剿共而决鬥，這便適用一個閧字；閧字中間有一共黨的共字，有了共黨，才閧；没有共黨，便不閧了。</p>
<p>已往的粤省私鬥，現在的魯省私鬥；這便適用一個鬭字；鬭字和鬥字同音，不過多了一個斵字，便斵喪着許多元氣；例如，海軍中的飛鷹艦，掖縣人民的生命財産，都是斵喪在這鬭字之下。</p>
<p>方興未艾的二劉戰四川，這便適用一個閱字；詩經上説；兄弟閱於牆；二劉雖非兄弟，卻是叔姪，所以二劉戰四川，只好説二劉閱四川。再者，閱字中間的兒字，分明是個無知兒童；國艱未已的當兒，叔姪倆還是相閱不休，不是無知兒童，是什麽？</p>
<p>若要同心禦侮，須有四不主義；便是國内不閙，不鬭，不閱。丨附註；拗相公便是王安石。</p>

<p>— 江萍</p>
<p>丨法國人眼中的中國丨</p>
<p>法國離　中國是這様的遠，而竟大言不慚的在談論着三民主義，國民黨中的人物，自不免要閙出無數笑柄來。法國小説家夏都尼以中國論一書獲得了格里戈奬金，而毛病正恰恰出在這本書中，底下便引了四則小錯處以博大衆一笑。</p>
<p>他説；（孫先生曾在巴黎寫他的三民主義，後來又把原稿掉了。（我們都知道三民主義是民國成立後，孫先生在上海和廣州兩地寫的，他第一次草案的失掉，是在廣州的内戰時期，那時孫先生的住屋也曾給火燒掉。</p>
<p>他説（孫科是蔣介石的舅子。）原因是由宋子文是蔣介石的舅子推來。這是那裏來的親戚觀念呢？他簡直誤會了蔣介石和孫科的繼母的親戚關係。</p>
<p>他説；（蔣介石的舅母丨丨宋子文夫人，曾營救過吳鐵城出獄的事。）吳鐵城的出獄是否得到宋夫人的營救，我們姑且不管，但據熟悉時事的朋友説；）當吳鐵城被逮捕時，蔣介石還不曾同宋家聯姻，而且宋子文夫人也還不曾和他訂婚。）</p>
<p>他又説；（宋子文在五年前，窮得連洋車都雇不起來，現在却以一千五百萬美金，買了上海最漂亮的大華飯店。）</p>
<p>宋子文在民國十五年時，已是國民政府財政部長，那時，不消説是洋車，就是汽車也可以享用了，而且他從未購過大華飯店。據我們所知道的，大華飯店的得主是銀行團，</p>
<p>夏都尼原不足責，他也不過是對於中國向持謬見的人中的一人而已！像這一類的謬誤，凡常看西方出版物的人，也許已相見成熟，不足爲奇。總之，中國，實在離開他們太遠了，太遠了！</p>
<h3 id="c95">紐約夜生活 <a href="#c95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— 葉華女士</p>
<p>丨伍朝樞亦有件趣事丨</p>
<p>美國紐约原名新尼德蘭，一六六四年英奪自荷，遂屬英王查理胞弟約克公爵，乃易今名。一七七六年美獨立，經之營之，不百年，其繁盛等今日之上海，曾幾何時，竟爲世人萬目睽睽之焦點，每欲一遊其地以爲快，友人周權，昨月自美歸，縱説紐約夜生活，爰撮述一二於次；</p>
<p>紐約夜生活之中心地，係夜總會，會分等級，頭等總會，弱小民族不得入焉。年前駐美公使伍朝樞擬往遊，電話中被拒絶，旋由紐約市長出而道歉，卒設特座，邀伍觀光了事。會内跳舞，别具風格，舞罷高歌，舞侣雙雙自由散座，談所欲談，不若上海之拘拘於男女間也　　新納爾者最高貴之夜總會也，進會資格，至少具有百萬家私以上者，所謂汽車大王，鋼鐵大王等之專利品也。箇中陳設，出人夢想，侍役之多，超出遊客數倍，地在中央公園前，與資本家宅第比鄰焉。</p>
<p>紐約寫字間女郎六萬餘，十九浪漫，每一入晚，輒濃裝艶服，手挽少年，消遙閒遊，反不若餐館酒肆之女侍者，守身如玉，安分盡職，其原因不無有經濟之背景。蓋女侍者，月俸四五十金外，猶可獲一二百金之小賬，足以自給，而寫字間女郎，月入束脩，亦不過爾爾，然志高慾大，奢侈成性，於是不得不仰賴他人，而於紐約夜生活中添一頁史料也。</p>
<p>娼妓之風，不限吾國，歐美亦盛，紐約商婦初無别緻，惟有一事足道者，即某一種娼寮，僅供房舍設備，是乃金屋不藏嬌者也。某一種則反是，有嬌而不備金屋者也。</p>
<p>歌劇爲紐約夜生活之集合塲，奈劵資過昻，一客往往七八十金，貧民望洋生嘆，煤油大王洛克番羅念及下民，捐助六千萬美金，建造可容十萬人之大劇塲，劵價祗收一二金，紐约共七十二街，該劇塲佔其四，可謂巨大矣。收聲配光與夫冷熱氣之供給，工程師忠心計劃，洵世界建築之劇作也，噫！文明國之所以文明，要亦人爲之耳，願國人莫怨天，莫尤人，各自奮發也可！</p>

<p>— 史勳</p>
<p>在最近十五年之間，劉海粟在中國的藝壇上取得一個最高的權威而在近來的畫家中發生巨大的影響。薄命詩人徐志靡説；）···從海粟的作品裏我們可以看出海粟一生精神的趨向。他是一個有體魄有力量的人，他并且能把天賦的體魄和力量着實按捺到他的作品裏。我們不能否認他的胸襟的寛廣，他意境的開展，他的筆致的遒勁。你儘可以不喜歡他的作品，你儘可以從各方面批評他的作品，但是你不能忽略他創造</p>
<p>的精神和獨占的地位，他是在那裏，不論是粗是細，他不僅是那裏，他并且强迫你注意，使你不自覺地感動。···）徐志摩這幾句話，是不錯的，他的線條有獨占的天分，他的一切的畫面純然是創造的結搆，而表示他偉大的永恒的卓越。他雖然受了許多大家的影響，然而他始終不失自我，他的作風仍是一貫的。他的每張作品都在向我們明示着他的氣槪，他的性質，他所遭的際遇，他所生的時代，他所處的國家。那便是豪放，力量，奮進，東方的新中國的期望。</p>
<p>現在他的代表作（巴黎聖母院夕照）陳列在展覧會時，使與（羅佛宫）相對；這實在是一種最好比例。（羅佛宫）的古銅一般的色感，和精密的手法，（巴黎聖母院夕照）那火一般的陽光和獷厲的神韵，常人視之極爲不同，其實是一而二，二而一的，同時能表現他的品性與人格，而寫出自然的隠秘。</p>
<p>人皆以爲劉氏擅長風景，不知他亦擅長人體和肖像，我們看他此次所出品的多數肖像如（馬相伯）思想者）（Ｌ夫人）等，一種特殊雄偉的美使人驚怪，他那飛舞而生動的筆　，確能表出深刻的肉感的韻味和精神的快樂與苦悶。</p>
<p>從他的風景裏更可以看出他描寫各地方的色彩，威尼斯的絇爛的光影，羅馬的色調强烈，瑞士湖山的秀置，比利時的太陽與向日葵，巴黎的灰色的神秘和嚴肅，均可以給我們以無，愛的尋味。至於他那　築物的堅實感，點景人物的稚拙感，都是他歐游以後的收穫。</p>

<p>— 求幸福生</p>
<p>魯伯勤自也極其感動，但心中另還有點不能釋然的憂慮，在喃喃告訴伊道；）爲愛情的圓滿，我二人自然都當慶幸。只是在尚未生入愉關之前，前途還是步步荆棘，不知究能逃得出這虎口不能；若稍有差池，我一人生死不足惜，連累了你卻怎麽好？）</p>
<p>（你又是這様了）！伊撒開手脫離了擁抱，很鎭定的説；）我見了這紙護照，就把它當作正式婚書，非常的心滿意足。即使立刻就要我去死，我也念着志願已達，此生不虚，死而無憾的了！）</p>
<p>（好的！你對於愛情竟有這大的勇氣，我又何必還要眞是那般卑怯？我們就手携手的大膽前進罷！）魯伯勤便也激昂起來，仍一手將伊扡到他懷抱中去。只是温存了片响，又低聲叮囑着道；（不過膽量大而心要細，等一會上火車，我們總要謹愼一點的好。）</p>
<p>這倒也是魯伯勤少年老成閱歷有得的處所；經他細細的告訴佟一貞，應當取如何謹愼和沉着的態度以後，及到當晚一同上火車站登車的時候，兩個人果都從從容容大大方方的極像個已成婚的少年夫婦模様，没露半點破綻。雖經過好幾處崗卡，好幾班如狼似虎的日本兵的嚴　厲檢查，那一一平安度過。</p>
<p>火車開後，他倆同一般郵員都在一節特别指定的三筆車上。有兩個日本兵，端着上了剌刀的步槍，把守在前後兩處的車門口，不許他他亂走到别節車去。兼之車廂中電燈也壞了，黑魆魆地像在陰慘的地獄，他倆便只好互相偎倚着在一條木椅上，而不知不覺的會昏沉沉睡去</p>

<p>拉雜寫來、已經一萬幾千字了、在本文結束以前、還有三個問題要附帶討論幾句、第一個是學風、第二個是體育、第三個是軍事訓練、最近十幾年來、中國學風的敗壞是無庸諱言的、有些學校簡直常年在風潮中過生活、不但學校中紀律的維持、團體生活的訓練、根本談不到、就連最低限度應該教的功課、也完全敷衍了事學生在中學如此混了六年、就成了中學畢業生、在大學如此混了四年、又成了大學畢業生、社會上充滿了這様的大中學畢業生、焉得不糟、國家社會每歲要費幾千萬金錢造成這種人、眞是件可痛心疾首的事、所以學風如不能夠改革、任何良好的教育制度都不能産生好的成績但是如何改革呢、以前政府對於學潮大都取放任態度、最近數月來才嚴格的施行制裁、嚴格制裁自然是應該的、但是我以爲要改革學風、還要靠教育界人本身的努力、過去有些學校之所以發生風潮、往往是因爲校長教職員没有能夠盡他們的責任甚而至於想利用學生來做他們的工具、校長教職員旣然可以利用學生來攻擊他人、反轉來學生自然可以攻擊校長教職員了、所以一個學校發生風潮學生固然不對、校長教職員也不能辭咎的所以眞要整頓學風、政府之選擇校長、校長之選擇教職員、必須格外愼重、不可使有濫竽充數的人、而同時校長教職員也必須深刻地明瞭本身的責任、敦品勵行、以身作則、絲毫不存利用青年的心理、才可以得到青年的信仰、引導青年向正當軌道上發展、任何學校内大多數學生總是可與爲善的只要做師長的領導有方、學風自然可以蒸蒸日上的、</p>

<p>— 曾裕</p>
<p>（一）外患。自去年九一八事變以來，瞬已年餘，敵人自攫奪我土地始，以及組織傀儡，承認僞國，方節節進逼。反觀我政府民衆，未嘗不奔走呼號，今日通電國聯，維持世界和平，明日呼籲列强，擁護九國公約。敵刦我關稅矣，外部提一抗議，敵又進攻熱河矣，政府發一通電。可是抗議儘管一而再，再而三，通電儘管天天發一個，然而試周一年來牠的效果究竟如何？誰都知道是等於零。</p>
<p>（二）内戰。國難如此嚴重的現在，國内一般軍閥，方大演其拿手好戲，過去有粤之二陳，現在有魯之韓劉，川之二劉，因了内戰的紛至沓來，又産生出一個民衆組織的廢戰大同盟，於是對於這類軍閥，横一個通電，（國難方亟，務望一致團結，（竪又一個通電，（有甘爲戎首，國人共棄，）可是憑你國難也好，共棄也好，他們一幕一幕的好戲正演得方興未艾，所以通電發得越多，他們演的戲也越起勁，最後，牠的效果，又是等於零。</p>
<p>拿以上兩件事來證明，可知中國人的做事，一味（專走專路，）但是事實已告訴你，（專走死路）是不中用的，是不會來解决你的一切困難的。所以現在又有好多人在大聲呼着（另覓途徑，）講到一另覓途徑，）這未始不是一種補救的好辦法，但是，這另一條（途徑）能，不能覓到，與覓到以後牠的效果究竟如何？這倒又是一個問題了。有人説：因爲覓不到（另一途徑，）所以只能（專走死路，）惟其只能（專走死路，）所以中國的（外患）和（内戰）永無解决之希望，我聽了這句話覺得到也有理，但我仔細一想，我要向偌大一個四萬萬民衆組織的中國問一聲了！丨</p>

<p>的確，灰鼠，狐皮這類，我們是無力去製牠，祇好徒望興嘆，不過，普通的羊，狗，貓，鼠，黄狼這類的皮，我們隨時隨地可以辦到，並且牠的代價也很便宜，那末何樂而不爲呢，現在就把牠的製法，簡易的寫在下面：</p>
<p>將有毛的生皮或乾皮，先經過一度的水漬（水用冷水混入○·一　之苛性）鈾與石炭酸（，使其恢復到原有有狀態，然後放置於傾斜的木板上，用純刀削去肉面上的不用部分（削時刀口與肉面成直角，厚薄又須平均，）再以鐵爬梳去皮面的舊毛，然後於肉面上塗布赤土，曝晒日光中，使皮體内的脂肪完全吸入赤土中時，即可用木棒打落呢土，以清水洗滌潔凈，即可行鞣製的工作。　　毛皮的鞣製，法甚简易，即將上項已經準備工作完善後的毛皮，擲入各種適宜的鞣液（注）中浸漬，普通的浸漬時間，約一二日已足，但須充分的攪拌和數次的反轉，至鞣液　完全後，即可取出乾燥，加以修飾，便成一張鮮艶而又柔軟的毛皮了。</p>
<p>（注）毛皮鞣液的種類很多，大槪可分；（一）用皮硝，食鹽，米粉的，（二）用明礬，食鹽的（三）用食鹽，油類的（四）用鉻鹽的。（五）用單寗或Ｆornaine的；亦有以數液混合鞣漬的，總之依原皮的種類而定，像上述的羊，貓，黄狼等皮，那末以第一法的皮硝，食鹽，米粉，或第二法的明礬食鹽等混合使用，也就鋔了。</p>

<p>— 文炳</p>
<p>本欄曾經發表過王士本君的（討論改良宗祠管理問題）一文，作者的意思，是在改良宗祠管理，那自然還承認它有存在的需要，這原是各人的見解和主張，我祗願把我的另一個意見也提出來，以供大衆參考。</p>
<p>我不贊同宗祠的管理改良，尤不贊同宗祠的存在，我的大前提是；根本把它廢除，理由如下。</p>
<p>以今日的時代潮流而論，已不容許封建餘孽的存在，但中國社會却還無處不有，族中宗祠，便是最具力量的封建形態之一，中國人除了家的觀念以外，便是族，因此族的組織，最爲健全，權威也就很大，每族族長，那簡直可説是土皇帝，此種土皇帝，好的固然也有，但總是壞的居多，他們在社會上，假着宗族的力量，往往作福作威，左右大小事體，例如甲乙二姓因事涉訟，甲姓本來理屈，但其族長等每每要强奪上峯，以維護其宗族的聲望，因此不惜典當祖産，死死地向官廳賄賂，勾結，弄得一件極平常的小事，不能安息，枉費許多精力與金錢，而且因此雙方感情惡劣，視同仇敵，廣東各地常有宗族間的械鬥，往往死傷枕藉累世成仇，在一般人看來，還以爲是爲族爭光，雖死猶榮。族中公欵，年久總是被三數强有力者蠶食呑併，或是藉祭祀爲名，盛張筵席，大吃特吃，浪費社會特質。從前若是族中有進學中舉的，必掛什麽扁，現在學堂畢業的，也還有弄這套把戲的，最是有</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>子孫在外邊做了官，刮到了民脂民膏，於是衣錦還族，修祠掛扁，此外如族長高壽，花様更多，掛扁，做戲，不一而足。總之，有了宗祠的存在，只見處處向虚榮的，消費的路上走、談不到絲毫利益。</p>
<p>對於族外的國家大事，却視之漠然，例如助欵東北義勇軍，從未聞有某族慨捐若干，去年的亘古水災，也未聞有某某巨族捐助幾何，遇到國家大事，便如此抱着（各人自掃門前雪）的主義，抓住錢囊不肯鬆手了。</p>
<p>就以上所論而言，已足夠地宗祠廢除了，何况現今社會，已根本不容許這種封建組織的存在，吾人處今日强鄰相逼的惡劣環境中，本來只應有民族觀念，以及整個的人類觀念，無疑地，這種狹隘的家族觀念，家族組織，是應該廢除的了。</p>
<p>廢除以後怎様？我也可稍稍提出一些意見；</p>
<p>宗祠的房屋用塲很大，如以之充作工廠，校舍，都是很好的塲所，或是用作孤兒院，平民住所，或民衆醫院，均無不可，只要看當地的社會環境如何，如在城市附近的，當然以辦工廠，孤兒院，醫院等爲宜，其在鄉村者，則以充作小學校舍，或民衆圖書館較善。</p>
<p>所有公産，亦應提出舉辦上項事業，絶不可任一二有權有勢的族長私呑。　　惟此種辦法，若祗日筆鼓吹，斷難收效，須由政府下令强迫實行，則一般頭腦冬烘者，自然只好，）口含右頭去拜天（，絶無反對之可能。</p>
<p>末了，我要説；今日之中國社會，眞是不長進極了，只見在在保守，而且只見壞的保守，不願銳意革新，所以社會國家，不但追不上世界潮流，而且日見落後了，我們亟須把目光放遠一點，着眼於國家民族的超拔，人類的共存共榮，再不容因襲傳統，把兩眼釘牢家族了。</p>
<p>附識；此文剛剛草好，忽接到長沙友人某君來函，説他的家族，横遭鄰族某姓欺凌，侵佔祖産，現在正在進行訴訟，要我邀友人力打公票，因與本文有關，爰附記之。</p>

<p>— 洪水</p>
<p>自從長雲公司裏新聘來一位專任打字工作的錢小姐，於是偌大的Office裏便覺熱閙了許多。向來寡言而且道貎岸然的袁好好先生，現在常浮泛着笑意和這位錢小姐攀談起來。至於素有（佳公子（之稱的丁先生，隨時保持他的頭髮的光滑褲縫線的壁直，健談大家賬房先生之洪鐘聲的滔滔不絶，更不用説了。</p>
<p>總之，一切都失了常態，自從錢小姐來萬綠叢中點了一點紅之後。</p>
<p>每天早上，錢小姐的倩影卡要瞥映到每一個同事眼簾的時候，誰都會用温存而親切的口吻來問這位滿面嬌羞的錢小姐的早安。她蓬鬆的頭髮拂在她的額上，好的嬌桃腮，碧眼，鮮紅的嘴唇，臉兒施着一層薄薄的香粉，穿的是，一身明艶奪目的衣裳，還帶有寳光珠氣的戒指和手錶。她在這辦公室的點綴、，恰像案頭供着的那隻（影泰藍）花瓶一様的名貴！</p>
<p>六號宿舍裏住的是景，文·琴三個人，一月以後一夜的月光下，景忽興致勃勃地大談起來。</p>
<p>（丁先生和錢小姐似乎有點關係了吧？）</p>
<p>（哦？）琴豎直兩耳，曳長頸子地表示極度歡迎下文。</p>
<p>（不錯，我也有這様的覺察。）文也像抓着關於他倆（性的問題）的鐵證一般的説</p>
<p>（爲什麽？這時琴已去掉了正看得津津有味的一本茶花女而揚起頭來。</p>
<p>（琴，你還妝　麽？他倆時常一對對的出入於公園，電影院，跳舞廳，難道你還不知道而没有注意嗎？（景説。</p>
<p>（對啦！這是千眞萬確的。）文插了一聲。</p>
<p>（這也值得大驚小怪，在這社交公開的當兒？（</p>
<p>）那末你説他倆一點兒毛病都不有嗎？好！讓我同文想個妙計來測騐他倆戀愛的程度給你看看！）景説着眼球上視，皺起眉頭，像煞在深思什麽似的。</p>
<p>翌日。恰是星期六的下午，丁先生忽然接到一封信，是錢小姐約他在星期日的下午三時卡爾登看影戲？同時錢小姐也接到一封信是丁先生邀她在星期日的上午九時去兆豊公園談心？兩封信的詞句都很簡單，而各個收信人亦只倉猝一看，可是都能得到一種愉快。</p>
<p>錢小姐果然一早就到公園，她東窺西望的一直到了十一點多鐘，不惟不見丁先生的影子，而且還無意間撞見了在她是討厭的景，文，琴的朋友，眞是侷促到萬分！</p>
<p>那鵠立卡爾登門前早已購得兩張花樓戲票揑在手中幾手要出汗的丁先生，眼巴巴的看着一雙雙的璧人，把座次陸續塡滿了，悅耳的音樂也停了，於是影片是開映了，獨不見寫信約他來看影戲的玉人丨錢小姐的光臨，此刻的他，已躁急忿恨到無以復加，但還要碰着一羣喜皮笑臉的仁兄，自然還是六號宿舍裏戀愛的測騐發明家老景們！</p>

<p>祗見張先生把一疊八字，這張看看，那張看看，嘴裏鬼獨鬼觸了一陣，手裏又子丑寅卯地輪了一回，慢慢地説道；）太太，請你靜聽！這個姓金的八字，不好用，因爲有兩層七煞，命太硬了，那姓李的，也不好用，因爲命裏有傷官，書上説的，男犯羊刃必重婚，女犯傷官定尅夫，所以這個八字，雖則聞得那李小姐，爲人賢德，學問又好，但有了這一個傷官大毛病，是斷用不得的了。）</p>
<p>（先生！那嗎其中一個姓陳的，怎様？這個小姐，聽説也很温柔能幹的，倘然命裏好用的，那是最好了。）</p>
<p>張先生忙把姓陳的八字揀出來，細細地端詳了一回，又用五個指頭，移東移西的推算了一陣，搖搖頭説道；（太太，這個八字，更不好了，命裏犯有陰陽叉，主着尅公婆的。）</p>
<p>（先生不要算了，把這個八字燒了　　　　　　　放　　犯公婆的敗命，還拿出來據　害人，（太太　時，滿臉怒容，惡狠狠的在張先生手裏，搶了那張八字，劃了一根洋火，把牠燒去，才後再説；（我雖則今年也已六十歲人了，但是一條老命，倒還想活着哩，所以見到人家拿犯公婆的八字來，最恨，先生！</p>
<p>請你再查别的。）</p>
<p>張先生心中暗暗好笑，想息已隨嘴説了一聲（犯公婆）害得她老人家這様着急，於是假作萬分鄭重似的，把一疊八字，再行查下去，嘴裏又這様胡謅着；</p>
<p>（這張犯有望門寡，不好用，那張是四柱多見印，將來赤髮寡眠，也不好用，一後來發現一縬姓洪的，自已有親戚關係，於是説道；（好了，好了，這張八字，是日逢長生，官星透露，財印俱全，名爲三寳，可卜榮夫益子，眞是一個富貴雙全之命，再好没有的了。）</p>
<p>王太太聽了姓洪的這張八字，有這様好法，於是樂得眉飛色舞，笑嘻嘻的點着頭説道；（好了，有了這様一個好八字，我是稱心滿意的了，這也是二兒　的福氣呢，如今别的不用再查了，我準定用這個便了，先生，費心，費心，）</p>
<p>隨便談談</p>

<p>用過九點鐘的中早飯，剛提起筆桿，想寫點騙人的東西丨文字，關人忽然興高烈的走來了，他踏進門檻，劈頭便是這麽句；</p>
<p>）特來邀你去買便宜貨，ＸＸ公司還在大减價，買一送一，贈品另外送！</p>
<p>（怎麽這様慌裏慌張，慢慢交是呀丨請坐吧！）我立起來與他緊緊地握了一回手，更繼續説下去；</p>
<p>（上海的花頭經邪氣多，一年四季各種商號，至少好玩四次，什麽减價，削價，賤賣，大拍賣，因了節季的不同，冠上春季，夏季，秋季，冬季的字様，花花絮絮的裝紥，嘴吧唱呌，鼓樂吹敲，此外還有若干週年及端午中秋，更冠以（特别）二字的大减價，初來上海的人，每每十一分相信平時需要的東西，都要等到這時候才去買。</p>
<p>其實壓根兒説，貨物一經過商的掌握，果眞有便宜貨給，我們享受麽？至多從少賺幾個的大减價手叚裏，稍漏餘潤罷了，等到大家都去買，貨物格外傾銷，商人也就越發發財了，而且假使你偶不當心，還得上意想不到的當，所以多少住慣上海的人，並不視大减價，以爲是了不起的好機會。）</p>
<p>）那麽，照你説，今天ＸＸ公司是不用去了！）關人有些敗興了，兩手反撑着後腦壳，半傾斜地躺在我底木板床上。</p>
<p>（是的，我是不贊同去的！丨丨自已眞不好説，不久以前，我還受過一闪當，四隻角子買了一雙套鞋，　算是便宜了，拿回來，僅僅穿了兩回、底子便是兩個銅板大的洞，關人，你想想，便宜不便宜？）</p>
<p>關人完全被我説服了。</p>
<p>）那也好，省下幾個錢來，下月的生活，倒也比較有着落些！</p>
<p>（對啦！講到大减價，我到還可以告訴你一件值得研究的事體，福田德三在國民經濟學講話裏説·····有一年中國底上海及其他市塲，人參的價錢，非常跌落·····於是不曉得依誰底主意，將那寳貴的人參，在仁川埠頭燒毁了許多，·····這事若於（物）這一點來講，那是很不成話的，因爲拿這東西來做藥，是很有效用的，現在把這様有用的東西，毫不顧惜地燒去，在不知道的人，定以爲是浪費和不經濟其實反是很合於經濟的，怎様説呢？因爲買人參的人，一聽着了仁川埠頭燒人參的這件事，就趕緊來買，因此不到幾天，上海的人參市塲，就回復轉來，剩下的人參，都以很高的價錢賣出去了，這様一來，以高價售賣燒剩的人參，就比以低價售賣全部人參，利益還更大了。</p>
<p>世上想吃人參而不能得到人參吃的人很多，這時偏偏有許多現成的人參被燒掉，這呌做合於經濟之道，研究這種經濟之道的，呌做國民經濟學。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Philippine Independence and Japan: Another Perspective <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The independence of the Philippines has already become an old question, and its importance seems minimal in today's turbulent world. However, powerful nations are now vying for dominance. The situation in Europe is like the late afternoon of sunset, with little room for further development in capitalist societies. Only the Pacific coast, whether it be the United States, Canada, the Siberian coastal provinces, or various parts of China, remains largely or at most semi-developed. Its future is like a seed just beginning to sprout. In the short term, it can regulate the current global economic panic, and in the long term, it can save the future decline of capitalism. This special interest will center around countries like China, Japan, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Unfortunately, China's subjective capabilities cannot control this objective situation. The Soviet Union is also focused on its domestic construction, making it difficult to get involved in the maritime power struggle for the time being. Therefore, the struggle for dominance in the Pacific is solely between Japan and the United States. The more intense the conflict between Japan and the United States becomes, the more important the Philippines' position becomes. Militarily, it serves as a link between America and China, and economically, it is a crucial hub for Pacific transportation. Thus, the independence of the Philippine Islands takes on a new meaning in the Pacific issue.</p>
<p>On April 4th of this year, the United States House of Representatives passed the Hare-Hawes-Cutting Act for Philippine independence with a majority of 306 votes against 47, which has aroused widespread public attention. The main content of the original bill is as follows:</p>
<p>(1. After the Philippines establishes a constitution and a national government, the United States will relinquish its sovereignty on July 4th, eight years later. (However, the United States believes that the constitution and the national government will take two years to establish, so Philippine independence should occur ten years later, while the Filipinos are eager for independence and plan to complete it in 1940.)</p>
<p>2. Before the United States relinquishes its sovereignty, the Philippine government can be completely autonomous in domestic affairs.</p>
<p>3. Before the United States completely relinquishes its sovereignty, goods imported from the United States to the Philippines can be exempt from tariffs, but a certain limit can be added to the current import amount.</p>
<p>4. Before the United States completely relinquishes its sovereignty, immigration from the Philippines to the United States will be limited to fifty people per year.</p>
<p>5. The United States should maintain its naval and military bases in the Philippines and retain other privileges.)</p>
<p>The fundamental reasons why the United States is re-proposing Philippine independence are: firstly, the Democratic Party is in power and wants to fulfill its commitments; secondly, the increase in Filipino immigrants to the United States has created a new problem; and thirdly, the import of Philippine sugar into the United States has affected the sugar industry there. Therefore, the aim is to prevent the import of sugar by granting the Philippines independence, thereby saving a part of the declining market. The Senate will also conduct a detailed discussion on this issue in this session. Some people in the United States (Democrats) believe that if the Philippines enters independence with a stable political form, the Philippines will be in the same situation as the small republics of Central and South America. It is enough to avoid external interference and win the protection of the United States. Moreover, the traditional policy of the United States and the habits of the majority of the American people all emphasize economic (security) development, and there is no need to rely on military force to win victories on the battlefield. Therefore, regarding the issue of Philippine independence, it is believed that if the United States allows it to be independent, it can show that the United States has no special ambitions for East Asia. This can promote the reflection of Japanese liberals, allowing the three northeastern provinces to follow suit and implement the (Open Door Policy), invisibly leading Japan to restrain its ambitions. Then, the situation of opposition and conflict between Japan and the United States in the Pacific may be alleviated, which is a great benefit to the United States. However, among the nations of the world today, only Britain, America, and France have reached a state of complete maturity. Although Japan has grown up, it is still precocious compared to Britain and America, so it still has the power to develop. It is especially determined to compete with the United States, so it operates day and night to try to achieve its goals. It disregards international credibility and uses military force to occupy the three northeastern provinces of China, intending to obtain abundant resources and occupy strategically important places. After several years of operation, it will not be difficult to drive out the economic forces of the United States in the East. The Chinese market will be monopolized by Japan, and it will not be difficult to seize the Philippine Islands by force.</p>
<p>(Liberalism) only has remnants. Internationally, it has become a historical relic. To seek its revival in the imperialist stage and thereby resolve the dispute over Pacific hegemony, not only will militaristic Japan refuse to retreat along this path, but even American gentlemen who are obsessed with the peace movement may not abandon their financial capital's monopolistic advantages. It is feared that in response to the economic panic, even more monopolistic forms will be adopted. However, advanced European and American countries have strong capital and abundant products, and the means they take against colonies and semi-colonies is economic control rather than military violence. Even when political oppression is used, it often does not adopt a bloody doctrine, but still advocates peace, so that the recipient does not feel its fierceness very much, and the initiating country enjoys the greatest benefits. Japan is a latecomer among capitalist countries, and its domestic politics still have a very strong feudal color. Even economic organizations such as Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and Furukawa zaibatsu are all rooted in feudal relations. Therefore, the state power organs, based on this social foundation, have a foreign policy that is different from that of Europe and the United States. If politics loses its absolute effect and the economy falls into poverty, and peaceful solutions cannot be found for a moment, then the most effective and cost-effective means of opening up a difficult situation is to use troops. Therefore, after invading the Northeast with military force, Japan is still building warships and cannons, trying to fight and dominate the Pacific Ocean. The United States wants to use peaceful means at this time, using Philippine independence to prevent the three northeastern provinces from being annexed by Japan, and seeking a new balance. It is inevitable to be a one-sided ideal. To suppress Japan's militaristic aggression, apart from using military force to restrain it, there is no better way.</p>

<h3 id="e3">Han Requests Extension of Troop Withdrawal Deadline <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Han Fuju Has Ordered the Front to Prepare for Troop Withdrawal</p>
<p>Jiang Bocheng Will Go to Jinan Again to Continue Mediation</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Central Government limited Han to withdraw troops before the 28th. Han telegraphed Chiang, Zhang, and He last night, saying that he would obey the order to withdraw troops. However, because Yantai and Longkou are mixed with foreigners, without prior arrangements, a hasty withdrawal of troops is feared to cause disputes. It is proposed that the navy take over the defense first, and after the takeover is completed, the troops will be withdrawn to western Weixian. The troop withdrawal deadline needs to be slightly delayed. It is heard that Han Guoxu will first withdraw his troops to western Weixian. The Han army in Yantai and Longkou is 700 miles away from Weixian, and it is feared that it will be defeated by Liu's army. Therefore, in military terms, Yantai and Longkou must first have proper troops take over the defense before they can withdraw. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Han's representative Liu Xizhong arrived in Beiping this afternoon, saying that Han absolutely obeys the Central Government's orders and has ordered the front to prepare for the withdrawal of troops. However, before Yantai and Longkou have proper troops to take over the defense, it is difficult to withdraw quickly for the sake of the people. Due to military relations, the withdrawal must also be gradual. After Liu got off the train, he visited Jiang Bocheng and talked for two hours, and decided to visit Zhang Xueliang tonight. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Liu Zhennian telegraphed Beiping stating: 1. Obey the Central Government's orders and stop military action, waiting for disposal. 2. Everything is going smoothly with the division. 3.

Zhang Xueliang advocated that Liu's troops be transferred and taken over by a third party, and asked Chairman Chiang to approve it. Zhu Peide and He Yingqin both hoped that the Shandong issue would be resolved as soon as possible. If Han's troops withdrew to the west of the Weihe River on schedule, the issue of Liu's troops being transferred would be easily resolved. After Liu's troops are transferred, they will be contacted by a certain army that was stationed in Shandong Province and has a harmonious relationship with Han.

<p>(Jinan) Zhang Boling passed through Jinan today on his return to Tianjin. According to reports, the Anti-War Association telegraphed the Central Government about the Jiaodong issue, stating that the provincial administration should be unified and the military defense areas should be determined by the Central Government. Chiang, Wang, Dai, and others all expressed their opposition to civil war. The press should arouse the people to support a strong and powerful government and carry out the Anti-War Movement, then the effectiveness will be great, and failure is not disgraceful. (Jinan) Zhang Weicun once telegraphed Jiang Bocheng, saying that since the Central Government has retained Han, the best way to solve the Jiaodong issue is to transfer Liu away from Shandong. Jiang replied by telegram saying that he had more sincere opinions to discuss with the Chief and Minister He, and that this matter had a solution and would come to Jinan to visit Han in the next few days.

<p>(Jinan) Zhang Weicun, Director of the Shandong Provincial Reorganization Committee, telegraphed Chiang today, roughly stating that the Shandong issue has reached this point and should be resolved quickly and decisively. The solution should focus on the local people's livelihood. Minister He's telegram on the 19th stated that in order to solve the initial stage of the Jiaodong military affairs, the people of Shandong all support it. However, the cannons of 40 days originated from the division of the provincial administration. The lives of the people in the twelve counties are concerned about the relief of suffering. What kind of guarantee is there to relieve the people from the remaining dangers of war? This is still doubted by the masses. This is why the Third Route Army has not withdrawn hastily. Finally, he said that the people of Shandong deeply believe that the prestige of the Central Government must be maintained, and local security must also be taken into consideration. Regarding the Jiaodong military affairs, they should still follow the orders of the military headquarters under the condition that the masses are given adequate protection. If Chairman Han resigns, he should be clearly ordered to stay. We hope that public opinion will be adopted and a solution will be sought quickly. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Jiang Bocheng said that after Han Fuju's representative Liu Xizhong came to Beiping, he asked me to forward Han's request to extend the deadline for troop withdrawal to the Central Government. I have telegraphed the Central Government to plead for Han, because the 28th is the deadline for troop withdrawal, which is too tight, and in fact, it has to be extended. I think the Central Government should approve it. Now Han and Liu's attitudes have shown moderation, and it is not difficult to resolve. (27th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Guangsan, representative of Liu Zhennian, said that Laiyang and Yexian are still surrounded by Han's troops. Liu's division in Yexian city has made full preparations.

<p>(Nanjing) Because France's attitude has changed, Japan is isolated internationally. Therefore, it has changed its policy and is trying its best to woo Russia. Matsuoka plans to lobby vigorously when he passes through Moscow, hoping to sign a non-aggression treaty in exchange for Russia's recognition of the rebel organization. According to observations from the diplomatic community, Japan's diplomacy towards Russia has always been conducted behind the scenes, with the rebels taking the lead in frontal negotiations. Recently, due to the change in France's attitude, it is doing its best to curry favor with Russia to avoid isolation. However, Soviet Russian diplomacy is known for its smoothness. With the League of Nations session imminent and the rebel organization despised by all countries, Russia will definitely not rashly sign a non-aggression treaty with Japan, let alone recognize the rebels. The rumor that Germany will recognize the rebels is even more unfounded. (27th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>(Shenyang) Since the night of October 20th, there has been a major conflict of wireless waves between Shenyang and Nanjing and Shanghai, staging an unprecedented air war. The Shenyang broadcasting station broadcasts military liaison to the various front-line units every night after the music broadcast ends at 9:30 pm. However, the power of the Shenyang broadcasting station is only 2 kilowatts, while the power of the Nanjing broadcasting station has always been known as the best in the East, with 75 kilowatts. Therefore, the broadcasts of the Shenyang broadcasting station are generally suppressed and disturbed. Although they can be heard in Shenyang, they cannot be heard in Changchun and Harbin at all. Therefore, the pseudo-organization recently plans to prepare a large power source of over 1 kilowatt for the Japanese to use to disrupt the radio waves of the Nanjing and Shanghai broadcasting stations. It is said that construction will begin soon. The future air war of radio waves is indeed worthy of attention. (27th China United Press Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e46">Honolulu Busts Military Base Map Theft Case <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>American Soldiers Stole and Reproduced Maps Hoping to Sell Them to the Japanese for a Good Price</p>
<p>Army Authorities Design a Spy Operation, Two Suspects Arrested</p>
<p>The National News Agency, Honolulu, 26th - Tonight, a private theft of military secret documents and maps was uncovered here. Two soldiers have been arrested at Fort Shafter. At the time of the incident, military intelligence officers raided a bungalow on Waikiki Beach, a famous swimming and boating area, and discovered a well-equipped facility for drawing and printing military maps. The details are not being released by army officials. Major General Welsh, commander of the Honolulu Army, only admitted to the arrest of two soldiers, but declined to announce anything further. However, according to sources close to the intelligence department, the two soldiers had stolen these secret documents and started reproducing them in the bungalow, preparing to sell them. Fortunately, the contents had not yet been leaked to potential buyers. It is said that they were hoping for a foreign representative to come and negotiate a purchase, and reliable sources say that they hoped to sell the maps to Japan first. However, when questioned, military officers denied this. According to reports, Waikiki is a common destination for army officers, and the soldiers' frequent visits to the bungalow aroused suspicion. Intelligence officers began investigating, and after checking records, discovered that several secret documents were missing. It was also reported that a non-military figure, a cartography expert, was also frequently visiting the bungalow. Intelligence officers secretly asked those friendly with the soldiers to gradually learn the details, and strictly forbade them from sending any warnings to the soldiers. An intelligence officer, posing as a representative of the British government, contacted the soldiers. Finally, after the soldiers were completely convinced, they were told that they wanted to purchase certain maps and documents for a price of 150,000 cash, with 100 ten-dollar bills marked with hidden marks as a deposit. It is said that the soldiers did not expect to be able to sell them for such a huge sum, and after briefly considering the possibility of selling them to Japan, they immediately accepted the cash transaction. Unexpectedly, a large number of intelligence officers arrived within minutes and arrested both the soldiers and the fake British representative. The fake British representative was then released, while the soldiers will be interrogated by a military court after the intelligence officers complete their investigation. According to sources close to the military, no foreigners are involved in the case. However, the officials involved refused to comment on whether this statement is accurate. It is also heard that the soldiers used the maps as a speculative item. One of the soldiers is a cartographer. Some of the cartography equipment was stolen from the military, and some was purchased from the market. The equipment was quite complete. The soldiers predicted that the secret defense maps of Honolulu are rarely used, and that the next naval maneuvers would not be until next spring, so they dared to boldly steal, draw, and print them, and then secretly return them to their original place, and so on.</p>
<p>[P Young People's Group Plotting Assassination of Yuhgaki&gt;</p>
<p>Internal Conflict Between the Araki and Ugaki Factions Within the Military Clique</p>
<p>Unstable Youth Ideologies, Strict Precautions Taken Nationwide</p>
<p>China Union Press, Tokyo, 27th - Yesterday, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department's Criminal Division uncovered a plot to assassinate the Korean Governor-General, Ugaki. The details are being kept strictly secret by the police, but according to some sources, a certain fascist group heard that General Ugaki will return to Tokyo from Korea at the end of the month and planned to assassinate him en route to eliminate military opposition. The conflict and struggle between the Ugaki faction and the Araki faction within the Japanese Army is currently very intense. The Manchurian invasion can be said to have been handled entirely by the Araki faction, and the Araki faction wants to implement a military dictatorship. The biggest obstacle to the progress of military dictatorship is the Ugaki opposition faction within the military. Ugaki has considerable trust among the elders, old officials, and chaebols, so many people consider him to be the successor to the Saito Cabinet as Prime Minister. It is heard that important figures were unexpectedly discovered to be involved in the case.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 27th - Police authorities are investigating the distribution of leaflets among young military officers criticizing a high court judge and a high-ranking military officer, and have discovered a plot to assassinate two important figures during the upcoming military exercises. Although their surnames have not been revealed, it is believed that one is Minister of the Imperial Household Makino, and the other is former Army Minister General Ugaki, as extreme reactionaries have been strongly attacking the two. Police have arrested a young man who sent a threatening letter to Finance Minister Takahashi.</p>
<p>Japan United Press, Tokyo, 27th - Several hundred Japanese youth soldiers received letters in mid-October in envelopes from the Osaka far-right group, Nankokai, in the name of the Imperial Officer Corps, discussing the May 15th Incident and expressing fierce opposition to the words and actions of a certain high official in the Imperial Palace and a certain army general. After discovering this strange document incident, the Army Military Police Headquarters and the Metropolitan Police Department's Special Higher Police Department attached great importance to the case and conducted a very secret investigation. As a result, they discovered a plan to assassinate a certain high official in the Imperial Palace and a certain army general during the army's grand maneuvers. As a result, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department's Special Higher Police Section suddenly became tense, and a meeting of senior officials from the Higher Section and the Investigation Section was held in the afternoon of the 26th. As a result of the consultation, the head of the Special Higher Police Section visited Chief Prosecutor Hayashi of the Prosecutor's Office at 4 p.m. and held secret talks for a long time. It seems that the authorities have grasped the center of the plan and will immediately take decisive measures and are now carefully preparing various preparations. A certain army general will come to Tokyo in the near future to discuss budget issues with government authorities, and the Metropolitan Police Department has decided to send personnel to seriously guard his side.</p>
<p>Japan United Press, Tokyo, 27th - The recent ideological situation in Japan is extremely dangerous, especially in terms of ideology and economy, so general police affairs are becoming increasingly complicated. The 60,000 police officers across the country are engaged in police duties day and night. Therefore, the idea of organizing so-called retired police corps in various parts of the country, and mobilizing them immediately in case of emergency to assist police affairs, has emerged. The Ministry of Internal Affairs authorities also approve of this move, but the qualifications of its members are limited to those who have served as police officers. According to the Police Affairs Bureau, there are 150,000 possible members nationwide.</p>
<p>China Union Press, Tokyo, 27th - The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department has already formed armed police teams to prevent riots by the Communist Party and fascist groups. The Ministry of Internal Affairs still believes that this is not enough and will add 500 more armed police officers, with a budget of 350,000 yen. A barracks for the armed police team will be built on the vacant land next to the Metropolitan Police Department, called the Emergency Guard Team, consisting of three major battalions, each battalion with 160 members, who will undergo strict military training and be equipped with the latest weapons, cooperating with the Guards Division to prevent internal strife.</p>

<p>Rumors of Russian Recognition of Puppet Organizations Revived</p>
<p>Remarks by a Certain German Official Trigger Rumors</p>
<p>Japan United Press, Tokyo, 27th - The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Army authorities have recently been studying the issue of concluding a Japanese-Russian non-aggression treaty with a cautious attitude. According to the government authorities, there are currently no mutually hostile or antagonistic matters between Japan and the United States, Britain, and France regarding the Manchurian issue, so it is not necessarily necessary to conclude a treaty with Russia, lest it provoke the emotions of various countries against Japan. However, Japan has always hoped to maintain friendly relations with Russia and has not changed its policy of avoiding conflict between the two countries.</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 26th - Reuters learned today that the Russian government is preparing to receive the (Manchukuo) consul stationed in Moscow, so rumors of Soviet Russia's possible recognition of (Manchukuo) have revived.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 26th - Officials here do not believe the rumors that Germany may recognize (Manchukuo). The rumors have caused considerable surprise here, and their origin is probably based on a conversation between a certain German official and the director of an American intelligence agency. It is said that the German official expressed the opinion that if recognizing (Manchukuo) would be most beneficial to Germany, then Germany could recognize it.</p>

<p>Insufficient to Curb Japanese Military Clique's Wild Ambitions</p>
<p>Reuters, Pittsburgh, 6th - US Secretary of State Stimson said in a speech here today that the cooperation of the United States is indispensable for maintaining world peace. Whenever war is about to occur and endangers the Pact of Paris, other parties have a responsibility to consult with each other, so that world opinion can be used to stop the war. The United States' non-recognition of the results of aggression has consolidated the dignity of the treaty and established a new cornerstone for the development of international cooperation to stop war.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 27th - The Japanese Army authorities have the following views on Stimson's speech at the Pittsburgh Church Council seat on the night of the 26th, adopting an attitude that does not require much attention. That is, Mr. Stimson's speech has no new meaning and has nothing surprising. It is merely a repetition of the US foreign policy declared by Mr. Stimson in early August. It is even less aimed at Japan, and the statement of imprudent claims is only aimed at worsening world sentiment towards Japan, the result is nothing but a deterioration of sentiment towards the United States. The world has long known Mr. Stimson's utopian legal theories, and the enlightened people of the world have long known that it is impossible to deal with the Manchurian issue with Mr. Stimson's legal principles. Japan has not violated the League of Nations Covenant or the Pact of Paris.</p>

<h3 id="e49">Japanese Government Instructions to Matsuoka: Content <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Yoshida Takes Report to Geneva</p>
<p>China Union Press Tokyo Dispatch - The Japanese government held a regular cabinet meeting on October 21 and decided on the following instructions for Representative Matsuoka: (1) Assist Permanent Director Nagaoka at the 69th Council meeting convened on November 14. If necessary, he may also represent Director Nagaoka to attend the Council meeting and give an explanation of the Japanese government's views on the same day. (2) At the Extraordinary General Assembly, it is not necessary to adhere to the previous abstention policy, and the claim of reservation of application of Article 15 of the Regulations, which has been taken since this spring, may be abandoned, and he may participate as an official representative in the vote to adopt or reject. (3) Regarding the (Manchukuo) issue, he must make the representatives of the contracting countries fully aware, not adhering to the technical aspects as before, and not only limit himself to diplomatic negotiations, but must be based on the political viewpoint of the overall situation and conduct multi-faceted negotiations. He must not take any measures that would miss the opportunity regarding these methods and means. (4) When reviewing the Lytton report, he must refute it in accordance with the main purpose of the Japanese opinion and make up for the shortcomings of the report. In particular, he must explain in detail the new facts that have occurred in Manchuria after the publication of the report, and he must treat the representatives of the countries with an enlightened attitude. (5) The solution of the Manchurian problem must be to wait and see the development of the situation and then make a final judgment. The prior issue is to enable the Chinese mainland to complete a modern sovereign state. If it is willing to take the League as the center and provide international assistance, the Japanese government is already willing to cooperate. (6) If you want to restore the sovereignty of the unmanaged Chinese National Government to (Manchukuo), the peace of the Far East will inevitably be reversed, so you should advocate the growth of (Manchukuo) and allow it to self-determination. (7) It goes without saying that if the League asks the Japanese government to cancel the recognition of (Manchukuo), it will resolutely oppose it. If the League intends to resolve not to recognize (Manchukuo), it should vote against it in a dignified manner.</p>
<p>China Union Press, Tokyo, 27th - Japan's opinion on the Lytton Report was approved by the Emperor on the 25th. Representative Yoshida is scheduled to depart from Tokyo at 9:25 tonight, and travel via Tsuruga, Vladivostok, and Russia to Geneva, carrying the opinion to the League of Nations.</p>

<p>Using Anti-Communism as a Pretext for Wanton Aggression Against China</p>
<p>Sufficient to Help Promote the Strength of the Chinese Communist Party</p>
<p>Havas, Geneva, 26th - (The Geneva Daily News) published an article commenting on Japan, which briefly stated: (The Japanese deceive Europeans, saying that Japan is a bastion against Bolshevism and a guarantee of order, and that Japan's operations are against a China that has been Bolshevized. Japan's acquisition of Manchuria is to prevent the advance of Bolshevism, so Europe should thank Japan. However, all of this is deception. The Chinese government does not express sympathy for communism, as evidenced by its use of troops to suppress the communists. Japan has an ambassador stationed in Moscow, while China does not. Sino-Russian diplomatic relations have been severed for several years, so the theory that Nanjing is influenced by Soviet Russia is not accurate. Japan says that its aggressive behavior can eliminate communism in China, but this is all nonsense, and not only cannot it eliminate the Communist Party, but it will only help the wicked. The spread of communism in China is due to the uneasiness in the hearts of the Chinese people. The hearts of the people are already uneasy, and Japan is invading them, so will the dangerous situation not be even worse? Moreover, the Chinese government is already spending a lot of effort to suppress the communists, and Japan is causing trouble from the side, so can the Chinese government still concentrate on suppressing the communists? All this proves that Japan's aggression is tantamount to helping the Chinese communists. Japan also said that although the country has relations with Soviet Russia, its intention is still to hate Soviet Russia, but this statement is even more unbelievable.)</p>

The main part of the notice is as follows: (All Chinese people, whether now or in the future, oppose the organization of (Manchukuo). As reported in the press, no one but those who work for Japan can say it, and no one can believe it. All Chinese territory, except for a few local problems near Zhifu, is peaceful. External news regarding the internal situation in China is deliberately exaggerating things, and its purpose is to make favorable propaganda for Japan. The Chinese Embassy asks public opinion not to be deceived.) Havas, Paris, 26th - Dr. Gu Weijun, Chinese Minister to France, is scheduled to give a speech on the evening of this Sunday on the topic of (China and World Peace and Prosperity) at the invitation of the International Wireless Lecture Conference, which will also be broadcast in the United States.</p>
<h3 id="e52">If Disarmament Ultimately Fails, Only Option is to Expand the Navy <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>

<p>Framework for Security Organization Plan Has Been Decided</p>
<p>Litvinov Will Not Attend Disarmament Steering Committee Meeting</p>
<p>Japanese Disarmament Representative to Geneva Ahead of Schedule</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 26th - President Hoover issued an article today stating that if disarmament efforts ultimately fail, the United States will have no choice but to expand its navy as permitted by the convention.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that this move will involve huge expenses and will be a major blow to the long-cherished wishes of the American people. The United States has exhausted its reasonable strength in seeking an agreement on disarmament among nations, based on the ratio set by the 1930 London Naval Treaty, and will continue to work hard. But if it fails, the United States, in view of the disturbances in various parts of the world and the need to protect American commerce, has no choice but to add to its navy.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 26th - Tomorrow is the tenth week anniversary of the American statutory Navy Day. This time, Washington and Roosevelt are regarded as the central figures of the commemoration, because this year is the bicentennial of Washington's birth, and Washington was also very concerned about naval defense during his lifetime, and deeply knew the importance of cooperation between the army and navy during wartime, and advocated it. President Roosevelt established the US naval policy, and tomorrow is his birthday. Because of his lifelong efforts to promote the navy, the government officially designated his birthday as Navy Day in 1922. This time, because of the dangerous situation in the Far East, Americans have become more concerned about this holiday. As for the US naval policy, the recent US Navy Commander-in-Chief Byrd (equivalent to the Chief of the General Staff) wrote an article for a certain naval publication, comparing the relationship between military preparations and the country with American and French views. It is said that the French view is the result of the atmosphere before the European War, with many wars as its natural product in the background, so it requires national security based on alliances and agreements, and uses force as a basis for promoting the implementation of alliances and agreements. The American view is different, although it has never been explicitly stated, it has never emphasized security, but takes the deep belief that (peace should be regarded as the normal state) as the starting point of its view. If peace is broken, it must be restored to normal as soon as possible. The United States uses direct methods of concluding agreements as a way to achieve the goal of maintaining peace, but it does not always consider security issues in the agreements it concludes. It also said that the movement of those who advocate peace and those who generally aim to reduce national spending is the greatest danger to the future of the navy. Other countries may be willing to abandon battleships, but after careful consideration of this wish, it is actually due to economic pressure, not that battleships are not very useful. As far as the United States is concerned, these battleships are of supreme value and should still be the center of the fleet.</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 26th - From 4 p.m. to 8:30 p.m., Premier Herriot, along with Army Chief Peng Gu, Navy Chief Leger, Aviation Minister Ban Lewei, and Colonial Minister Sha He, discussed the disarmament and security organization plan proposed by France. After this long discussion, great progress has been made. Not only has the outline been determined, but each of the key points has also been studied and clarified one by one. The High Defense Committee will meet on Friday morning and finalize its text. The High Defense Committee is chaired by the head of state, and the attendees include all the ministers and military chiefs related to national defense affairs, as well as the entire cabinet.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 27th - The final draft of the French construction disarmament plan was passed by the cabinet yesterday, and some of it has been disclosed in this morning's newspapers. It is said that it contains several plans: (1) The relevant countries reach an understanding that they will no longer increase military preparations, and at the same time hope to gradually reduce them, which is another guarantee for universal security. If this universal security is guaranteed, France will allow the reorganization of the army, reducing the current term of service from one year to nine months, and setting up a militia as an auxiliary to the regular army, but on the condition that it does not interfere with the defense of the French border. (2) Conclude a convention stipulating that each signatory country must unite military forces to deal with aggressive countries, and allow the delivery of bomber planes and a portion of artillery to the League of Nations, so that the League of Nations can rely on them to force countries to fulfill this treaty. Then, Britain and the United States guarantee the maintenance of the current state of Europe. This move is enough to increase Britain's obligations to Europe and force the United States to abandon its policy of not interfering in European affairs. Even if this convention is equal to a consultative convention, it does not require the United States and Britain to take military action, it is enough to cut off trade with the aggressive country, and it will increase the obligations of the United States and Britain to Europe.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 27th - Navy Vice Admiral Nakano, the Japanese representative to the Disarmament Conference, will depart for Geneva ahead of schedule on November 4. According to the Japanese newspaper, Nakano's early departure is because the United States and Britain have recently consulted and there is an image of holding a five-sea power meeting of Britain, France, Italy, Japan, and the United States.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 27th - According to reliable information, Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov has notified Henderson that he intends not to attend the Disarmament Conference Steering Committee meeting convened on November 3, but the British side has heard that British Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Minister Simon will both personally attend the meeting.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Washington, 26th - Kong Xiangxi, China's special industrial envoy, met with Mecca Cassey, director of the US Financial Rehabilitation Corporation, for a long time today to discuss the deferred sale of cotton and wheat to China. Mr. Kong proposed that the company lend money to purchase cotton and lend it to Chinese yarn mills. It is heard that today's talks between the two sides only concerned the issue of loans and China's ability to repay the loans, and no specific conditions have yet been mentioned. According to the Financial Rehabilitation Corporation, it has already stated its willingness to lend money for wheat, as long as a responsible agency approves the move. However, it has not yet expressed its attitude towards lending money to purchase cotton to supply Chinese factories.</p>

<p>Neutral Nations Notified of Willingness to Accept Arbitration</p>
<p>Havas, 26th - A dispatch from the capital of Paraguay reports that two hundred Bolivian soldiers have recently been captured by Paraguayan troops. It is widely rumored that Paraguayan troops have already occupied the small fort of Samakle.国民社 (Guomin She) 26th, Washington - Bolivia today formally notified neutral nations of its willingness to resolve the Chaco border dispute through arbitration. Paraguay, having repeatedly achieved victories, had already accepted arbitration. It is now expected that the neutral Latin American nations belonging to the Pan-American Union will appoint an arbitration panel. Peace may be restored before the Union convenes its general assembly in the capital of Argentina next year. The Chaco is a vast triangular area, a swamp plagued by poisonous snakes and miasma. Bolivia seeks to gain access to the sea through it, as Bolivia currently can only reach the sea via Chile. It hopes that after acquiring the Chaco, it can navigate the Pilcomayo River and enter the Paraguay River to reach the sea. Paraguay, on the other hand, values the Chaco's forests for their precious timber and tannin. It is also unwilling to allow enemy warships to pass its doorstep. Therefore, it is determined to contend for this territory.</p>

<h3 id="e57">Allied Sichuan Armies Launch General Offensive Against Liu Wenhui <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Fierce Battles Occur in Jiangjin, Yongchuan, and Dazu</p>
<p>A dispatch from Hankou reports that the Sichuan war has been going on for a month, and the main battles have long begun. The so-called political solution is merely empty talk. The situation of the fighting is not yet fully clear here, but generally, Liu Wenhui's troops have suffered some setbacks. The front lines of both sides stretch for hundreds of miles in an arc from Jiangjin, Yongchuan, Dazu, and Tongnan to Suixi and Pengxi. Eastern Sichuan is where the elite troops are concentrated. Liu Xiang issued a telegram on the 23rd denouncing Liu (Wenhui). On the 24th, he ordered a general offensive on all fronts. Mu Yingzhou led the army and navy out of Jiangjin. Pan Wenhua led four brigades out of Da'anchang, attacking Yongchuan. Tang Shizun's troops moved out of Dazu, and Wang Zuanxu's troops moved out of Tongnan. All routes were mobilized simultaneously. The divisions of Zhang Zhihe and Chen Hongwen, under Liu Wenhui, are doing their utmost to resist. The outcome is unclear. On the Jiangjin front, one of Liu Xiang's warships was sunk by Liu Wenhui's troops, suffering some losses, but the entire front line has not been shaken by this. Liu Wenhui is said to be facing street fighting in the Chengdu hinterland with Tian Songyao's troops, and there is also a joint threat from Liu (Cunhou), Deng (Xihou), Yang (Sen), Li (Jiayu), and Tian's troops. Therefore, he has not taken the offensive on the Jiangjin, Yongchuan, and Tongnan fronts, only maintaining his positions and defending without losing ground. Liu (Wenhui) and Deng and Tian have a deep relationship because they are from the same school, and their personal friendship is strong. They have often formed alliances in previous wars. The current rupture between Liu and Tian must have an inside story. Liu Zhengmei and Deng are mediating, and they are also trying to please Deng in many ways. If their opinions can be resolved, then the situation in Sichuan may change again. The generals of the Sichuan army mostly disregard faith and righteousness, only pursuing profit. If they can create opportunities for themselves, they do not necessarily have to side with Liu Xiang. Liu Xiang is now supported by the various armies and has come out to oppose Wenhui, and the situation has already become like riding a tiger. He will soon take office as the Director-General of Pacification for Sichuan and Kang Provinces to rally support. His telegram denouncing Liu Wenhui was also issued on the same day (26th).</p>

<p>He Chengjun Goes to Fancheng to Supervise Suppression</p>
<p>A dispatch from Hankou reports that the remnants of the Red Bandit Xu Xiangqian, who had previously fled west across the Pinghan Railway from eastern Hubei, were once surrounded in Suixian. They then broke through the encirclement and fled north. At dawn on the 23rd, the bandits, with about 20,000 men from four divisions, harassed Lujiawan via Gengjiaji. They were met head-on by Zhao Brigade of Liu Maoen's troops and retreated towards Zhaoyang. In the Zhaoyang area, at Tuqiaopu, Qijiaji, and Wangjiabo, they clashed with the Liu and Qiu brigades of Liu's troops. Fierce fighting lasted all day. On the 24th, the bandits fled towards Xiangyang and then fled north into southern Henan. Most of them fled to Dengxian overnight, while a small number remained in the Xiangyang area. The National Army's Tenth Division (Li Mo'an), Eighty-third Division (Jiang Fusheng), Fifty-first Division (Fan Shisheng), Forty-fourth Division (Xiao Zhichu), Forty-first Division (Zhang Zhenhan), and Liu Maoen's Division (Luo Qijiang Brigade), a total of six divisions and one brigade, were divided into groups to encircle and suppress them from Suixian, Yicheng, Zhongxiang, and Xiangyang. Many bandits were killed along the way. He Chengjun departed from Yuekou a few days ago, intending to go directly to Suixian from there to organize an administrative office and command the various armies. Now, in order to facilitate the supervision of the suppression of the bandits who have fled to the border area between Xiangyang and Dengxian, he has decided to go to Fancheng instead. He happened to receive a telegram from Generalissimo Chiang, summoning him to personally receive instructions. Therefore, on the 26th, he took a military plane from Yuekou back to Hankou to meet with Generalissimo Chiang and report on the situation of rural pacification and rehabilitation in central Hubei. On the 27th, he accompanied Chief of Staff Guan Linshu on a plane to Fancheng to set up residence. According to what He told visitors, the remnants of the bandits in central Hubei have now disappeared, and local order is gradually being restored. The Anti-Communist Volunteer Corps also has a sound organization and is currently handling rehabilitation. However, the people of the counties have long been troubled by banditry, and after the devastation of the rural areas, they are in dire need of replenishment of agricultural implements and economic loans. Most of the bandits in northern Hubei have fled into southern Henan, and small groups remain in Hubei. It should not be difficult to wipe them out in one fell swoop. I will again visit Chiang tomorrow morning to ask for instructions, and on the same day, I will rush to Xiangfan to supervise the troops. The bandit suppression forces in northern Hubei, the Fan, Xiao, Zhang, and Luo units, were originally under He's command. The Li and Jiang divisions belong to Wei Lihuang, and Liu Maoen's division belongs to Liu Zhenhua. It is now heard that they will all be placed under He's control to facilitate military operations. As for the remnants of He Duan's bandits, they have recently been engaged in fierce battles with Zhang Liansan's guerrilla commander in the Huangjiaji, Wangjiaji, and Caijiaji areas of northern Hubei. They suffered heavy losses in the battle of Caijiaji and fled north to Baokang. They were then intercepted by this unit at Baoxinpo, Baibutipu, and Xiaojianian in Nanzhang County, resulting in three days and nights of bloody battles, but they were ultimately unsuccessful. They have now fled back to Zhongxiang and are being surrounded and suppressed by parts of the Fan and Xiao divisions. The bandits are fleeing back and forth, and their strength is declining day by day. They now have only a few thousand men left and should no longer be a threat. (October 26)</p>
<h3 id="e59">Han Fuju's Attitude is Calm <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Waiting Quietly for Central Government Orders</p>
<p>A dispatch from Jinan reports that after Han Fuju issued his resignation telegram on the 21st due to the stimulus of the Jiaodong incident, four days have passed. Han's attitude remains calm and composed, and he continues to handle all affairs as usual. I went to the provincial government today to meet with Han and asked if there were any telegrams from various parties. Han said that since I issued the telegram requesting resignation, I have received telegrams from various places. Director Zhang (Xueliang) advised me not to act rashly, and President Song (Ziwen) advised me not to lose heart. Today, Generalissimo Chiang and Chief Advisor Chiang (Bocheng) have not yet sent telegrams. I have a compelling reason for resigning and have no other intentions. I am now quietly waiting for the clear orders of the central government. I also asked how Chief of Staff Liu Shuxiang, who returned to Jinan from Weifang, reported on the situation at the front. Han said that Chief of Staff Liu came from Weifang this morning and reported that the situation in Yexian and Laiyang is as normal and there have been no changes. (Note: After Liu Shuxiang reported to Han, he still took the armored car back to Weixian from Jinan at half past noon to handle the rear affairs.)</p>
<p>Since Han issued his resignation telegram on the 21st, the representatives of the gentry and merchants here, Miao Shiyuan, Zhang Shuhang, Sha Mingyuan, etc., jointly sent a telegram to the central government to retain Han. The Jinan City Chamber of Commerce also followed up with a telegram requesting the central government to approve the retention in order to comply with public opinion. Xu Zushen, the administrative commissioner of Weihai, who is recuperating in the Peking Union Medical College Hospital, and the entire Shandong judicial community also sent telegrams to Han, requesting him to give priority to the overall situation and not to lose heart. Other county party headquarters, Jiaodong fellow villagers, etc., also sent telegrams to retain Han. The telegrams from the Jinan City Chamber of Commerce, Xu Zushen, and the judicial community to retain Han are recorded below:</p>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce telegram to Chairman Lin of Nanjing, President Song of the Executive Yuan, Chairman Chiang of Hankou, and Chairman Zhang of the Beiping Military Branch Council: Shandong Province has suffered damage from the May 3rd Incident, and the vitality has been damaged. Repeated floods and droughts have also occurred, and bandits have risen. The people are exhausted and cannot be described. After Chairman Han came to Shandong, he rectified officialdom, suppressed bandits, and allowed the people to recuperate, and they were able to recover slightly. Now, he has suddenly developed a desire to retire and has telegraphed to resign. Upon hearing this, how shocked we are! At this time of national crisis, when everything hangs by a thread, the overall situation in North China is of utmost importance. We earnestly ask you to comply with public opinion and approve the retention. Shandong Province is fortunate, and the people are fortunate. The Jinan City Chamber of Commerce of Shandong and seventy-three trade associations bow and have</p>
<p>Xu Zushen's telegram to Chairman Han: Zushen has been ill for more than ten days and suddenly heard that you have suddenly developed a desire to retire. At this time of national crisis, Qi and Lu rely on deterrence. For the sake of the party and the country, you must not be allowed to stand aloof. Zushen has always received your great love and is eager to retain you. I offer my humble words from my sickbed, hoping that you will consider them. Xu Zushen of Peking Union Medical College bows and has</p>
<p>The telegram from the judicial community to Chairman Han of the Shandong Provincial Government: After reading your telegram, we admire your noble character, bright integrity, and heroic spirit that shines through the ages. Your strict words and justice, benevolent heart, and ability to inspire the weak and encourage integrity have encouraged the people. We yearn for you and are deeply saddened. For the past two years, Qi and Lu have been blessed with sweet dew, and the four suburbs have been surrounded by barriers. Your kind clouds have sheltered this land. Your courageous retreat in the face of rapid currents is a fulfillment of your original ambition, but the people suddenly lose their protection and feel bewildered. The flurry of telegrams shows the hearts of the people. Moreover, the country is in trouble, and powerful neighbors are displaying the might of a long snake and a wild boar. The lives of the people are hanging in the balance, and all hope for the rain to nourish the people. Therefore, we earnestly ask Wei Gong to take on the task of comforting and protecting the people again, and we all hope that you will not harbor the thought of abandoning them. Zhen Zuan, Shi Zeng, and others who have long enjoyed the spring rain of the judicial system in Shandong Province share the same hatred of the enemy and deeply fear the perilous boat ahead. We earnestly hope that you will consider the national crisis and shoulder your responsibilities. Please consider public opinion and cancel your resignation. Then Shandong will be fortunate, and the country will be fortunate. We respectfully submit this telegram, hoping that you will consider it.

<h3 id="e60">Communist Bandits in Rizhao, Shandong Province, Have Been Defeated <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Division Commander Zhan Shutang Sends Victory Telegram</p>
<p>A dispatch from Jinan reports that a week ago, communist bandits suddenly rioted in Rizhao, southern Shandong, harassing the villages and towns of Rizhao, confiscating the self-defense firearms in various places, burning, looting, and killing, turning the places they passed into ruins. A gang led by An Fengduo also fled to Wulian Mountain in Zhucheng. Zhan Shutang, the commander of the Eighty-first Division stationed in southern Shandong, went to Rizhao from Linyi to supervise the suppression, and ordered Brigade Commander Yun Qichang to pursue and suppress the bandits in Wulian Mountain. Because the bandits were newly uprising rabble, not worth a single blow, they have now been defeated and fled. The victory telegram from Zhan Shutang received by the provincial government is recorded below: (According to Brigade Commander Yun Qichang's report from Jietou Town last night, this morning I led my troops from Shentuan to advance towards Wulian Mountain. While marching to Jietou, local people reported that more than 200 communist bandits were entrenched in the Ping Shan Maxiakeng area. I immediately divided my troops into two routes to encircle and suppress them in Ping Shan, Laoshan, and Changling Cliff. At 1 pm, we came into contact with the bandits. After several hours of fierce fighting, more than 80 communist bandits were killed and more than 50 were captured alive. More than 30 rifles were seized. Three soldiers of our army were injured. The remnants of the bandits fled into the Zhengbei Mountains. I tracked and pursued them for more than 20 li. According to local people, the bandits fled southwest again. Because it was late and due to supply problems, I returned to Jietou to camp and wait to find out the whereabouts of the bandits before leading my troops to suppress them. According to Regiment Commander Chen's report from Songbailin last night, I led my troops from Chijiazhuang at 6 am this morning to advance towards Wulian Mountain. At 11 am, I arrived at Yulinzi at the foot of Wulian Mountain. According to reconnaissance, the communist bandits fled from Wulian Mountain to Jiuxian Mountain, where they were entrenched, burned, and killed. I immediately led my troops to pursue them. At 2 pm, we arrived at San Shankou and came into contact with the bandits. I then ordered the First Battalion to climb the mountain and advance, and I led the Second and Third Battalions directly to encircle and suppress them on the right flank. After fierce fighting, at 5 pm, we chased to Songbailin. Because it was late, we camped there. In this battle, more than 100 bandits were killed. The bandit leaders An Fengsui and Yu Gongfang are of unknown status. More than 50 people were captured alive, including the bandit leader Chi Xiwu and four female bandits. More than 50 rifles and horses were seized. Five officers and soldiers of my regiment were injured. According to the captured communist bandits, the remaining communist bandits fled south and plan to continue tracking and suppressing them tomorrow morning. There are no more than 20 people left, and they have fled without a trace. We are now searching for the teaching bandits in Taoluo and Rizhao and handling rural pacification in the hope of eradicating the roots.) Chairman Han instructed that the army's meritorious deeds in suppressing bandits should be rewarded with 4,000 yuan to encourage them, and to eliminate the banditry within a time limit in order to eliminate the people's suffering and stabilize the place.

<p>Accident During Wireless Radio Experiment in the Air</p>
<p>Pilot and Radio Technician Killed</p>
<p>A dispatch from Guangzhou reports that since the Guangdong Air Force has been greatly expanded, all aviation military supplies have been purchased and completed one after another, such as the allocation of anti-aircraft artillery teams and the organization of telecommunications teams. The telecommunications teams use wireless radios installed on airplanes to communicate with land telecommunications teams. Recently, they have recruited German students studying wireless radio to be responsible for setting up wireless radios on airplanes. At about 2 pm on the 21st, the Air Force dispatched Alast No. 3 airplane for use by wireless radio expert Ye Daguan for testing. At 2:15 pm, Alast No. 3 airplane took off from the Sheguling airfield, piloted by Hu Qixuan, deputy captain of the First Team. The wireless radio was installed at the tail of the plane, and Ye Daguan was also sitting in the back of the plane to carry out the experiment. When the plane rose to more than a thousand feet, the wireless radio struck a sky electric discharge during the test, causing electric fire. The inside of the plane was burned by the electric fire, and the tail of the plane was set on fire in an instant. The telephone</p>
<p>Radio technician Mr. Ye shouted loudly, but pilot Hu Qixuan in the front was blocked by the sound of the plane's propeller and could not hear anything. When the fire reached his eyebrows, Ye Daguan was forced to jump off the plane. When he fell to the ground, his hands and feet were broken, and he was seriously injured and died on the spot. After that, the fire reached the wings, and pilot Hu Qixuan was also unable to escape and was buried in the fire. The whole plane was destroyed and slowly fell down, but the embers were still burning, like a shooting star falling. When the airfield personnel became aware, the Alast airplane on fire had fallen into the rice field near Shipai Station on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway. Air Force Commander Huang Guangrui and Chief of Staff Lin Fuyuan rushed to the scene to rescue them with their staff, but the whole plane was already in flames and could not be put out. When the fire subsided slightly, only a pile of white bones of the pilot Hu Qixuan remained in the broken plane, as if cremated. The machine gun on the plane and Hu's parachute were also burned. The total loss of the plane was about 170,000 yuan. The Air Force personnel urgently transported Hu's remains out and searched for the body of the wireless radio technician, finding Ye's body hundreds of feet away. However, he had been dead for a long time, with his hands and feet broken and lying in a pool of blood. They then hired a funeral company to examine the body. Hu Qixuan was found to be the deputy captain of the colonel team, 25 years old, from Kaiping, and graduated from the second term of the Air Force School. He had participated in the various battles of Jia, Lu, Yu, Gui, and Yue. In the battle of, he was awarded a heavy prize for being wounded by Feng and Yan's artillery. He got married this year, and his wife is now pregnant. Ye Daguan studied wireless radio in Germany and recently returned to China and worked in the aviation industry. He died in this first experiment of wireless radio on an airplane. Ye was the eldest son of lawyer Ye Xiasheng and was only 21 years old. (October 21 evening)</p>

<h3 id="e63">Aftermath of the Land Survey Turmoil in Jiangdu <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>A dispatch from Yangzhou reports that although the land survey turmoil in Jiangdu has come to an end, the villagers are angry with each other because many people are still being held in custody. Some are even venting their anger on the town chiefs and deputy chiefs, destroying their houses. The most bizarre thing is that the incident originated in the Second District, but it has now spread to the Tenth District. Yesterday (25th) at 5 pm, more than a dozen houses of Xiao Jie, the town chief of the district, were destroyed. At the same time, the house of Xiao Zhenyang, the deputy town chief, was also completely destroyed. Today (26th) at 1 pm, the town chiefs and deputy chiefs came to the city to report to the county government. County Magistrate Yang Zhuomao happened to be at the River Conservancy Bureau, discussing follow-up matters with Han Deqin, a member of the provincial government, and Li Mingyang, the director of the Security Office. Town Chief Xiao and others went to the River Conservancy Bureau to meet Yang and report everything. This morning, more than 1,000 villagers from the Huaiziqiao area in the northern countryside planned to enter the city from the north gate. Zheng Tongsheng, the deputy platoon leader of the Eighth Platoon of the Third Battalion, led his troops to the north gate to defend and displayed machine guns to deter them. At 1 pm, it was reported that a large number of villagers wanted to enter the city from the west gate. Therefore, those responsible for security strengthened the defenses at the west gate and piled up sandbags to block it. More than 300 villagers were seen passing through the west gate to attend a meeting at Huaiziqiao. Fortunately, nothing happened until the evening. At about 3 pm, Provincial Committee member Han Deqin and Security Office Director Li Mingyang went to the county government to meet with County Magistrate Yang to discuss and investigate the 24 villagers in custody. It took a long time, and as a result, 10 people with lighter suspicion were released on bail after providing a guarantee. The remaining 14 people, including Huang Jinbao (Kangjiazhuang, southern countryside), Xu Dexiang (Xiaowang Alley, Nangong Temple), Sun Qiyu (south end of Brick Street in this city), Tang Qibin (Zhangjia Alley, southern countryside), Xiao Kangpan, Wang Yonghua (Zhujia Bridge), Tang Kanghai (Chenjia Lou), Lu San (Quekou), Zhu Qipai, You Rulin, Zhu Guoliang (Shaheqiao), Wang Yunwan (Xiejia Wei), Wang Xiaomazi (Wangjiazhuang, Xu Ningmen), and Gu Guocai (Gujia Zhuang), were deemed to have heavier suspicion and were still held in custody, pending a report to the province for instructions. Zhou Shaocheng and Ge Jianshi of the provincial party headquarters went to the Taiyang Palace area, the starting point of the incident, this afternoon to investigate. The propaganda teams organized by the county party headquarters went to the countryside to publicize this morning. The county chamber of commerce also issued a notice, advising the villagers to repent and return to their senses. The government will deal with the damage that has already been caused leniently. It is hoped that the villagers will live in peace, restore order, and show repentance. The government will not investigate deeply. It is heard that the two provincial committee members, Han and Li, will convene a meeting of the district chiefs and deputy town chiefs of the first, second, and third districts this evening to inquire in detail about whether there was any corruption in the land survey. The county government's files have now been sorted out and about 40% of them are usable. It is also heard that the Central Party Headquarters' Supervision Yuan and the Ministry of Military Affairs have secretly sent special commissioners to Yangzhou to investigate the truth of the turmoil.

<p>Today's Establishment Meeting at the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>A communication from Zhenjiang stated that the Shanghai Local Association, concerned about the excessively low rice prices in various regions, causing hardship for farmers and merchants, specifically sent letters to enthusiastic leaders of organizations in Jiangsu Province that produce a large amount of rice, appointing representatives to gather in Wuxi on the 17th and 18th of this month. A joint meeting was held at the County Chamber of Commerce, attended by twenty-four leaders and commercial representatives from various places, including Suzhou, Changzhou, Wuxi, and Yu, and invited Director He of the Industry Department and County Magistrate Chen of Wuxi to attend. The main purpose of this meeting was to unite officials and the people to first organize the Jiangsu Province People's Food Regulation Association. The membership should include representatives from the Civil Affairs, Finance, and Industry Departments, the banking sector, chambers of commerce from rice-producing areas, the financial sector, farmers' banks, and other reputable and impartial individuals. In addition to the twenty-four representatives from various places who attended the meeting and acted as initiators, Wang Xiaolai from Shanghai, Yang Hanxi from Wuxi, Lu Xiaobo from Zhenjiang, Yu Xiaochuan, and leaders of chambers of commerce from major rice-producing areas such as Wujiang, Kunshan, Songjiang, Qingpu, and Rugao, should also join as initiators. Localities in counties with significant rice production could also follow suit and organize county associations. It is reported that the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce received a letter yesterday from the Wuxi Chamber of Commerce, stating that the Jiangsu-Shanghai People's Food Regulation Association, initiated by Mu Ouchu, Jiang Wenyu, Wang Zhixin, Huang Renzhi, and others from the Shanghai Local Association, is scheduled to hold its establishment meeting at 4:00 PM on the 28th of this month at the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce. They hoped to notify various counties and relevant organizations to attend. The Chamber has already notified various chambers of commerce and representatives of relevant organizations to attend the meeting in the province on time. (27th)</p>
<h3 id="e65">Recent Situation in Tibet <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Tibet is located in the remote southwest frontier. Due to inconvenient transportation, the Chinese people know very little about its situation. We have gathered a relatively detailed report from various sources to share with the nation.</p>
<p>Politics: In Tibet, political power and religious authority have traditionally been separate and unrelated. In the 21st year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, the Dalai Lama, the religious king, imprisoned the political king, the Mo Buddha, and seized his seal of office. From then on, political and religious power were concentrated in the hands of the Dalai Lama. At that time, although the Qing government had troops stationed in Tibet, they were corrupt and incapable of fighting, and all Qing troops withdrew without a battle. After seizing both religious and political power, the Dalai Lama showed little regard for China. He acted unilaterally in foreign affairs and had to flatter the British due to geographical reasons. In recent years, the Dalai Lama, feeling his position was secure, gradually became less flattering to the British than before. Therefore, the current Dalai Lama is not as pro-British as he used to be, and the British are not as pro-Dalai Lama as they once were. However, a small group of subordinates still fawn over the British and collude with them. The Dalai Lama's political tactics are entirely about being smooth and adaptable, treating the British and the central government in the same way. On the one hand, he sends representatives to be permanently stationed in the central government, while on the other hand, he prepares for war and secretly buys weapons, constantly invading the border areas of Sichuan. He does this because the Dalai Lama knows that the central government has no time to care. The Dalai Lama's politics are entirely autocratic. Believers must regard him as sacred, and the people should view him as surpassing all emperors. His every word and action must be obeyed by the people. Therefore, the people have a situation of daring to be angry but not daring to speak out against him.</p>
<p>Economy: Due to repeated wars in recent years, the Tibetan economy has become increasingly depleted for both the government and the people. The Sichuan-Tibet war cost the people 3 million rupees. After the defeat in mid-May, more than 500,000 of military equipment was purchased from the British. As a result, merchants and ordinary people are facing a situation of sitting and waiting for death due to harsh taxes. Taking Lhasa as an example, more than fifty shops have closed down since February due to economic difficulties. The exhaustion of the Tibetan economy is due to the recent wars, but the long-term cause is the economic aggression of the British. When buying goods in Tibet, people must exchange Tibetan currency for rupees in India. In the past, four Tibetan silver dollars could be exchanged for one rupee, but now thirty Tibetan silver dollars are required to exchange for one rupee. In order to collect silver, the Dalai Lama manufactures copper coins, issues paper money, and forces the people to use them. Therefore, the people's assets are only in the form of copper and paper.</p>
<p>Military Affairs: The Tibetan army currently consists only of infantry. There are very few cavalry and artillery. The infantry is mostly drafted from the civilian population and receives very little training. Among them, there are more than five thousand well-trained infantry who have been trained by the British, Russians, and Japanese. This is the most elite part of the Tibetan army, currently stationed in the Longbulingka Garden. The military equipment is bought from India, which is equipment discarded by India. Recently, a batch of new-style rifles, machine guns, and mortars was purchased from the United Kingdom, which is a very unfavorable sign for the central government. The uniforms worn by the soldiers are all contracted by the British. Their style and color are exactly the same as those of British soldiers. The flag used by the army is a lion, with colors of red, yellow, blue, white, and black. The current army is about 50,000 people. Soldiers are between the ages of eighteen and sixty. Military pay includes 900 taels of barbarian silver per year for officers, and the Dalai Lama also grants land. If an officer dies in battle, the land granted after death is inherited by his children. Soldiers receive a monthly salary of four taels of silver, and the Dalai Lama also grants a certain amount of land. However, even if they die in battle, the land is not inherited by their descendants; instead, it is given to the soldier who fills the vacancy.</p>
<p>Society: Due to the cold weather in Tibet, there are very few products. Therefore, the living standards of the general population are extremely low. The main food of the people is barley, wheat, and green fruits. The upper class occasionally eats rice, but except for a small amount produced in Dui, most of it is purchased from India. Even daily necessities such as oil and salt are imported from India. Due to religious reasons, fish is prohibited from being cooked, so there are many fish in the ponds and lakes in Tibet. Marriage is dominated by polygamy. The scarcity of women and the hardship of life are the main reasons for implementing this system. Most lamas do not marry. The Dalai Lama himself has not married. All his associates are young lamas. It is rumored that there are secret women, but it is not dared to be made public for fear of losing the people's faith. Recently, the Dalai Lama has a confidant, who is also male, and has great influence in front of the Dalai Lama.</p>
<p>The People: The Tibetan people can be divided into three parts: one part is the people who support the Panchen Lama, one part is the people who support the Dalai Lama, and the other part is the Red and Yellow sects. The people who support the Panchen Lama often hope that the Panchen Lama will return to Tibet to get rid of the Dalai Lama's harsh rule. However, the Panchen Lama's return to Tibet is a difficult problem because his power is not equal to the Dalai Lama. Without a decisive method from the central government, there is no possibility of success.</p>
<p>In short, the instability in Tibet and the disputes in the southwest border of our country have no solution. Recently, the central government plans to change Tibet into a province. This is a good strategy for dealing with Tibet. Tibet is very poor in form, but in fact, its natural wealth is the best in the country. The reason why the British pay attention to Tibet is because they love its abundant mineral resources. The types of minerals include gold, silver, copper, iron, coal, etc., and the quality is good and the quantity is large. In a certain year, a Japanese person disguised himself as a Chinese person and sneaked into the mainland, spending several years of hard work to investigate minerals. The samples collected are worth more than one million yuan, which shows the abundance of mineral resources.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Anhui People Oppose Rice Tax <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Bengbu Chamber of Commerce Sends Telegram to Yu Youquan to Block His Arrival</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: The rice tax in Anhui Province is a disguised form of rice levy. When Chen Diaoyuan was the chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government, it was stopped due to repeated opposition from the people of Anhui and an order from the Executive Yuan, as well as an impeachment from the Supervisory Yuan. After the reorganization of the provincial government, the authorities, citing the emptiness of the provincial treasury and the exhaustion of finances, resumed collection in the name of managing food. First, rice and grain export inspection offices were set up in northern and southern Anhui, then changed to rice tax inspection offices, and later changed to rice and grain export administration bureaus. Now, Ye Yuanlong, the Director of the Department of Finance, has changed the method again and established the Anhui Provincial Food Export Management Committee in the provincial capital, formulating regulations, with Management Committee member Li Yunqi concurrently serving as the Director of the Wuhu Management Bureau, Lu Zhongnong concurrently serving as the Director of the Dashengguan Management Bureau, and Yu Youquan concurrently serving as the Director of the Bengbu Management Bureau. All three bureaus are under the jurisdiction of the Management Committee. The Bengbu Management Bureau also governs the Wangtai, Hao County, and Jieshouji sub-bureaus. After Yu Youquan was appointed, he departed from the province and will arrive in Bengbu in the coming days. The local Chamber of Commerce believes that the authorities are creating excuses to restore the rice tax, which is tantamount to collecting a disguised rice levy, and it is difficult to recognize. Yesterday, the chairman of the Chamber, Peng Zhuoru, sent a telegram to Yu Youquan, expressing his opposition. The original telegram stated: "To Mr. Yu Youquan of the Food Management Committee of the Anhui Provincial Government, Greetings. Recently, I read in the newspaper that you have been appointed as the Director of the Bengbu Rice Tax Bureau. As a fellow townsman, I offer my congratulations. However, in recent years, Anhui Province has been plagued by excessive taxes and levies. In addition, the rice tax is unbearable for the people of Anhui who have survived the disasters. At the National Food Conference, the central government issued an order to abolish the rice tax so that food can circulate throughout the country. Moreover, the rice tax has been repeatedly opposed by the local people. Your morality and reputation have long been admired by the local people. Even if the government believes that there is no source of funds for road construction, you should act in accordance with your original intention of loving your hometown and speak out for the people. If you do not do this, the people of Anhui will be disappointed, which is a pity for you. Zhuoru has known you for a long time and offers sincere advice. If there is anything inappropriate, please forgive me. Bengbu Chamber of Commerce, Peng Zhuoru, respectfully (25th)"</p>

Chen Henian, the director of the local collection bureau, after taking over, due to the fact that the county's tax revenue was too far from the contract amount, repeatedly discussed solutions with the leaders of the tobacco and alcohol merchants.

<p>After four consecutive days of gains, the gold market situation yesterday felt even more sharp, with the upward trend continuing unabated. However, there were still changes in the middle. There were price swings of five taels in the morning and afternoon, but the market was still stable, with a difference of no more than three taels. The cashiers of various firms took different approaches. The market opened high, likely due to the decline in the silver market and the sharp fall in exchange rates. It then reached a new high of 757 taels and 2 qian. However, when foreign banks sold US dollars and British pounds, Chinese merchants, despite seeking to settle accounts, were met with constant selling from the banks. As a result, arbitrage selling was strong, and the price fell sharply by five taels. Later, the banks were able to take in some, and the short sellers took the opportunity to push the price down. The market returned to a high point. Demand and supply were slightly different in the after-market, and the treasury was set. As a result, the price was above 56 taels.

Hengyu, Zhifeng, Yongzhao, Fengchang, Daxing, Yongjing, and Zero Account short sellers rushed in, and the price immediately jumped by 2 taels, to 57 taels and 2 qian.

Speaking of yesterday's market situation, apart from the spot market remaining very quiet, with only 5,000 yuan traded, the futures market, although December futures have opened but without any transactions, November futures had a sharp price increase, market conditions were very prosperous, and buying and selling parties were very active, with a total transaction volume of 2,400,000 yuan in the morning and afternoon markets, totaling 4,810,000 yuan, including 1,020,000 in salt tax, 900,000 in consolidated tax, and many others with 5-600,000 yuan. However, Regular Six, Customs, and Finance remained quiet. Looking at the trend of various bond prices, before the settlement, people are often waiting and watching, and there are usually no major changes. However, yesterday, the market buying sentiment was suddenly prosperous, people were in good spirits, the market demand and supply were disparate, and the prices were rising sharply, with fluctuations of more than one yuan in the morning and afternoon markets. As a result, the Disbandment Bonds futures rose sharply by as much as one and a half yuan compared to the previous day, and most others also rose by more than one yuan. However, Compilation and Customs only rose by five or six jiao, and 1921 Good Bonds only opened in the morning, and the rise was also significant. It is said that the sudden rise in bond prices is due to the stabilization of the north, the easing of the Sino-Japanese situation, optimistic sentiment, and many parties making up for it, and the northern gangs also made considerable purchases.</p>

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm Report, Wednesday (26th) New York Stock Market, due to the declaration of preferred stock dividends by US Steel, and at the same time due to falling bonds, the pound and wheat plummeted to new lows, and people's hearts were greatly divided and didn't know what to do. The trading performance was still in decline. Before the market opened and closed, short positions were slightly covered, and the result was slightly higher than the previous day. The 60-day lending rate fell to a new low of 0.05 percent. The workload of steel mills was 19 percent, a decrease of 5 per thousand from the previous week. Because the general election is approaching, all industries have few orders. However, the continued maintenance of preferred stock dividends by US Steel shows that the company is optimistic about the future of industry and commerce.</p>
<p>The total trading volume for the day was 900,000 shares. American Telephone and Telegraph rose by 1.5 yuan, Union Pacific Railway rose by 1.625 yuan, and American Copper and Iron rose by 0.625 yuan. The Dow Jones Index is attached below:</p>

<h3 id="e81">### Cotton Yarn Prices Surge on the Last Day of the Month <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>丨丨Buyers Prepared to Take Delivery, Shorts Only Able to Cover丨丨</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market remains stable, but the situation is still calm. Because the environment is still deteriorating, most are shorting and watching for declines, so the pressure is particularly heavy. The actual needs of customer gangs are sluggish, but the October standard yarn is the last day, and market prices are rising steadily. Because there are too many dispersed shorts, buyers are prepared to take delivery, and general shortages of shorts only have to cover according to the market, so the rising trend is more intense, rising by three taels and one candareen alone.</p>
<p>The trend of Renbiao軋空(short squeeze): In the Renbiao pre-market opening, the momentum was slightly firmer due to the rising trend of American cotton, and each month rose by 4, 6, and 9 candareens, and this month rose by 1 tael and 6 candareens. In the afternoon, general dispersed shorts for this month covered, and it rose by another 1 tael and 5 candareens, and the rest of the months were flat. The total transaction statistics for the day were 29,200 bales. It was found that Yükang sold 1,800 bales, Mingde 1,350 bales, Shenji 750 bales, and Rongxing 900 bales. Changfeng bought 1,700 bales, Mingbei 1,250 bales, Yicheng 900 bales, Xincheng 900 bales, and Changyu 850 bales. The closing price is recorded below:</p>

<p>The cotton market is gradually showing signs of firmness, because American cotton is rising continuously, but some manufacturers still have a strong desire to sell, and the market is weak as soon as it rises. However, recently, the exchange rate has shrunk and gold prices have risen, and cotton merchants are generally wary of short positions. The future remains to be seen, depending on the expansion and contraction of American cotton, but most people think that the domestic new cotton is about to be launched on the market, and financial conditions are extremely tight, and villagers are unable to hoard it, so there is a saying that future sources will be abundant, so they are looking down and selling. It was found that the amount of shortselling by the sellers was too high, and the changes in the future were unpredictable, so they dared not go against it.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Strengthens The Zheng Biao pre-market opened, and the market atmosphere was quite strong. Due to the consecutive rises in American cotton for two days, the momentum was tight and high, and each month rose by 3 candareens. Later, the big households sold and fell back by 1.5 candareens. The afternoon was flat and weak. The total transaction volume for the day was 64,100 dan. It was found that Xincheng sold 10,600 dan, Hengde 6,600 dan, Changji 1,800 dan, and Ruidda 1,600 dan, Jifeng 1,300 dan, Guangfeng bought 4,200 dan, Renfeng 2,400 dan, 　Feng 5,500 dan, Yifeng 3,800 dan, Xiesheng 1,500 dan, and Taichang 1,300 dan.

<p>Yesterday, about ten rice boats from various gangs arrived in South Shanghai. However, the inventory in Pǔdōng(浦東) was limited, and the sentiment was upward. The kiln-grown Baige rice was shouted up by 0.2 yuan, and the broken white rice also increased by 0.1 yuan. Lúyáng(蘆洋) long-grain rice arrived, sales were decent, and the price did not rise or fall. There was no new japonica rice from Sūzhōu Tónglǐ(蘇州同里) and Kūnshān(崑山) on the market.</p>
<p>Yesterday, more than 20 sources came from the west road of Xīnzha(新閘), and the urban-rural transaction was more prosperous than the previous market. The new West Baige slightly increased in inventory, and the market price rose sharply by 0.1-0.2 yuan. The arrival and accumulation of 　rice were scarce, and the demand was not healthy, and the market price was stable and tight. The arrival and sales of Bùdù(埠杜) long-grain rice were dull, and the market was in a flat state. The total number of loads was about 4,000 shís.</p>

<p>丨Customer Gang Purchases Very Actively丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign customer indica rice market was more active, and this street was still booming with the arrival of rice from Héxià(河下), and did not pay attention to the foreign customer indica rice, but the demand in this street was still active, and the market was more firm. The Northern Gang continued to purchase and load after the Southern Gang, and the appetite was stronger. The price of Zhōngguān(中關) goods was raised by 0.03-0.05 yuan, and 450 bales of No. 1 Saigon were sold at 9.17 yuan, and 300 bales of Xiaojiao were sold at 8.03-7.9 yuan. The transportation of Hunan rice is still being planned, and a new batch arrived yesterday, and subsequent arrivals continue, and some are being loaded and are on the way, and will arrive in Shanghai in a few days. Yesterday, 600 bales of Hunan rice from Píngjìng(砶靖) were sold at 7.65 yuan, 7.55 yuan, and the lower grade at 7.35 yuan. Another 400 bales of Zhànjìng(棧靖) rice were sold at 8.75-8.55 yuan. No. 1 Saigon and Jiangxi Jiguan were purchased by the Northern Gang, and the rest were purchased by the Fuzhou Gang.</p>
<h3 id="e85">### Flour Market Ending Shows Slight Improvement <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, the market in each month showed a preliminary sign of fatigue and continued stability. As the quotation of foreign wheat continued to fall by a huge amount of about 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 yuan, most people's sentiment was naturally depressed. However, as the attitudes between the factories were different, Fufeng continued to release files in order to maintain the livelihood of the workers and to meet the trend of falling world prices, and the other factories were less active, and some speculation was born with the hope of high prices due to the saying that foreign wheat will be taxed, and the market price returned to stability. Forced to open the market in the afternoon, people's sentiment was still flat. However, due to a certain factory taking in the near future, there will be no warehouse receipts for delivery this month. Fufeng still had files to release in the long term, but because a certain party deliberately spread doubts, there was a bullish trend, and the people's sentiment was slightly better. However, in terms of the trend abroad, there is still a sign of collapse. It is reported that the asking price for Canadian spot wheat is 3.52 yuan for No. 2, 3.46 yuan for No. 3, 3.4 yuan for No. 4, and 3.35 yuan for No. 5. Australian wheat has also fallen to 3.55 and 3.6 yuan. In this case, it is useless to create a hard backing, and domestic rice prices are very cheap, such as the sales of Hankou flour, which is completely hit. It is said that most factories have even stopped production, so the decline in this kind of commodity price is natural and cannot be avoided for a while. As a result, this month was slightly better than the previous day by 0.025 yuan, November was better by 0.05 yuan, December was better by 0.075 yuan, and January, February, and March were better by 0.1 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e86">### Buying Sentiment Turns Strong in the Wheat Futures Market <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the futures wheat market opened in the morning, the market in each month still showed a bleak and flat atmosphere. As the quotation of foreign wheat continued to fall by 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 yuan, people's sentiment was naturally not good, but there were very few sellers, and the market was stable. Until the afternoon market opened, the people's sentiment was reversed and the buying sentiment was also strong, because the nervous people said that a certain big factory would be very bullish, which led to the people's sentiment, and because there was not much actual short chip in the market, the market was easy to fluctuate once it was supported. However, the price of spot foreign wheat is abnormally soft, and the sales of flour are likely to come from Shanghai because of the cheap rice price, such as the cheap price of Yangtze River flour, so it is also a natural trend that the wheat market is difficult to recover. As a result, this month was down 0.1 yuan from the previous day, and November to January each rebounded by 0.04 yuan, February was better by 0.03 yuan, and March was better by 0.04 yuan. The spot wheat market is still stable, with 350 bales of Yao Wan wheat opening at 3.35 yuan.</p>

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm Report, Wednesday (26th) Chicago wheat, due to weak Canadian wheat, December futures plummeted to 44.125, a new record since futures trading began in 1862. Traders believed that the low wheat price was due to too much wheat. The total volume traded on the 25th was 40 million bushels. The market prices on the 26th are listed below:</p>

<p>December Futures 44.750 Down 0.625</p>

<p>Overseas markets: Recently, Japanese silk has repeatedly fallen and actively promoted sales. The asking price for New York B-grade Japanese silk is less than 500 taels. Therefore, the Shanghai white factories have telegraphed that the price is too high and will not be transferred. The general hoarders are thinking of hoarding at low prices. All manufacturers believe that the silk capital is not loose and the loss is too great, so they all maintain and do not sell. The factory is completely stagnant. Yesterday, only Dachang entered Mujian Yang, returning the top brand, 13 to 15 strips of Sichuan yellow factory silk, 10 packages at 495 taels, Samsung entered Weiyichang brand, top grade, over-pot yellow coarse silk, 7 packages at 280 taels.</p>

<p>Yesterday, in the local foreign firm tea market, the Zhen Mei, Zhen Mei Xiu Jiao and other green teas from the Laílù roadhouses, which are shipped and sold to the Xiehe, Tóngfú, Jinlong and other foreign firms in France, are showing strong interest, and the city's transactions are quite prosperous. The selling price did not change much. For the Gong tea item, the Russian Xiezhuhui is still buying without letting up. The sale of Pingshui tea to the United States is also active. The green tea market seems to be better than the previous few days. However, each tea market disk has fallen to the extreme, and the losses suffered by Chinese tea merchants are more than 30 taels per dan.</p>
<h3 id="e90">### Sugar Market: Only Dutch Red Sugar is Strong <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was characterized by rising gold-standard sugar prices and the guild's price fixing, while the delivery side remained tight. No. 24 coarse sugar was called for 15 taels, but the actual transactions recently have remained sluggish, so even though the gold standard, which is related, has repeatedly risen strongly, it has not been able to stimulate the purchase interest of importers. As a result, there were a few transactions at 14 taels and 9.5 candareens. Medium-grade sugar is in short supply, and the market is better, with No. 20 at 14 taels and 4 candareens, and No. 18 at 14 taels and 2 candareens. However, the red sugar market is uniquely strong, with the new No. 9 Dutch red sugar white package priced at 11 taels and a half, and the No. 8 flower oil package at 11 taels and 0.75 candareens. The Jianbang brand also released a batch of Bagua brand rock sugar, totaling 100 packages, with a price of 11 taels and a half. Jian ice sugar only had sporadic transactions, and the price did not rise or fall.</p>

<p>丨Land Prices and Market Prices All Rise丨</p>
<p>Chaozhou red dates: Recently, there have been few arrivals of Huangliao, and land prices have risen repeatedly. Prices have risen by 3-4 yuan later, so the Shanghai market is extremely tight. The supplies of merchants have been sold out, and there is not much left in the inventory of firms. For example, the high-quality goods that were 27-28 taels in the previous market now require 30 taels. The average-quality goods once arrived at about 16 taels, then rose to 17 taels and a half, and are now priced at over 18 taels. Still no supply is expected for the market, so if there are arrivals in the future, there is still a chance of further price increases.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Various Kinds of Fighting <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>The "Shuo Wen Jie Zi" (an ancient Chinese dictionary) defines the character "鬥" (dòu, fight) as "two scholars facing each other, with weapons behind them, resembling the form of fighters." There are various kinds of "鬥" (dòu, fight). "鬥" (dòu) plus "市" (shì, market) becomes "鬧" (nào, noisy); "鬥" (dòu) plus "共" (gòng, together) becomes "鬨" (hòng, rowdy); "鬥" (dòu) plus "斷" (duàn, break) becomes "鬭" (dòu, struggle); "鬥" (dòu) plus "兒" (ér, child) becomes "閱" (yuè, review). I will now imitate Wang Anshi's (a famous reformer) style of creating new characters and compose the following new character explanations:</p>
<p>When important figures in the country fight over prestige and influence, the character "鬧" (nào, noisy) is appropriate. They make a big fuss for the sake of practical interests, focusing solely on profit and disregarding righteousness, displaying a strong mercenary spirit, hence the character "市" (shì, market) in the middle of "鬧" (nào).</p>
<p>When engaging in a decisive battle to suppress the communists, the character "鬨" (hòng, rowdy) is appropriate. The character "共" (gòng, together), representing the Communist Party, is in the middle of "鬨" (hòng). There is "鬨" (hòng) only when there are communists; without them, there would be no "鬨" (hòng).</p>
<p>Past private feuds in Guangdong province and current private feuds in Shandong province are appropriately described by the character "鬭" (dòu, struggle). "鬭" (dòu) has the same pronunciation as "鬥" (dòu), but with the addition of "斵" (zhuó, chop), it signifies the depletion of much vitality. For example, the Flying Eagle warship in the navy and the lives and property of the people of Yexian County have all been depleted under this character "鬭" (dòu).</p>
<p>The ongoing war in Sichuan between the two Lius is appropriately described by the character "閱" (yuè, review). The Book of Songs says, "Brothers quarrel within the walls." Although the two Lius are not brothers, they are uncle and nephew, so the war in Sichuan between the two Lius can only be described as the two Lius "reviewing" Sichuan. Moreover, the character "兒" (ér, child) in the middle of "閱" (yuè) clearly represents an ignorant child. In a time of national crisis, the uncle and nephew are still reviewing each other endlessly. If they are not ignorant children, then what are they?</p>
<p>If we want to defend against foreign aggression with one heart, we must have the Four No's Policy, which means no "鬧" (nào, noisy), no "鬭" (dòu, struggle), and no "閱" (yuè, review) domestically. 丨Note: Wang Anshi is the "Obstinate Prime Minister".</p>

<p>France is so far away from China, yet they shamelessly talk about the Three Principles of the People, and people in the Kuomintang inevitably make countless jokes. The French novelist Chautemps won the Grigo Prize for his book "On China," but the problem lies precisely in this book. Below are four minor mistakes cited to elicit laughter from the public.</p>
<p>He said: (Mr. Sun wrote his Three Principles of the People in Paris and later lost the original manuscript.) We all know that the Three Principles of the People were written by Mr. Sun in Shanghai and Guangzhou after the establishment of the Republic of China. The loss of his first draft was during the civil war in Guangzhou, when Mr. Sun's residence was burned down.</p>
<p>He said (Sun Ke is Jiang Jieshi's brother-in-law.) This conclusion is derived from the fact that Soong Ziwen is Jiang Jieshi's brother-in-law. Where does this kinship concept come from? He simply misunderstood the kinship between Jiang Jieshi and Sun Ke's stepmother.</p>
<p>He said: (Jiang Jieshi's aunt—Mrs. Soong Ziwen—once rescued Wu Tiecheng from prison.) We will not discuss whether Wu Tiecheng's release was due to Mrs. Soong's rescue, but according to friends familiar with current affairs,) when Wu Tiecheng was arrested, Jiang Jieshi had not yet married into the Soong family, and Mrs. Soong Ziwen was not yet engaged to him.)</p>
<p>He also said: (Soong Ziwen was so poor five years ago that he could not even afford a rickshaw, but now he bought the most beautiful Dahua Hotel in Shanghai for 15 million US dollars.)</p>
<p>In 1926, Soong Ziwen was already the Minister of Finance of the National Government. At that time, needless to say, he could afford rickshaws, even cars. Moreover, he never bought the Dahua Hotel. As far as we know, the owner of the Dahua Hotel is a banking group.</p>
<p>Chautemps is not to be blamed. He is just one of many people who hold erroneous views about China! Such errors are common among those who regularly read Western publications and are not surprising. In short, China is indeed too far away from them, too far away!</p>
<h3 id="e95">New York Nightlife <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Ye Hua</p>
<p>丨An Interesting Story About Wu Chaoshu丨</p>
<p>New York was originally named New Netherland. In 1664, the English seized it from the Dutch and gave it to the Duke of York, the brother of King Charles of England, and changed its name to the current name. In 1776, the United States became independent, and after years of development, its prosperity is comparable to that of Shanghai today. It has become the focus of world attention, and everyone wants to visit it. My friend Zhou Quan returned from the United States last month and talked about New York's nightlife. I will briefly describe a few things below;</p>
<p>The center of New York's nightlife is nightclubs. Nightclubs are divided into different levels, and people from small and weak nations are not allowed to enter the top nightclubs. Years ago, Ambassador to the United States Wu Chaoshu planned to visit a nightclub but was rejected over the phone. Later, the mayor of New York came forward to apologize and eventually set up a special seat to invite Wu to visit. Dancing in the nightclub has a unique style. After the dance, the dance partners freely sit down in pairs and talk about what they want to talk about, which is not as restrained between men and women as in Shanghai. Newnal is the most distinguished nightclub. The qualification to enter the nightclub is that one must have at least a million-dollar fortune. It is the patent of the so-called automobile kings, steel kings, etc. The furnishings inside are beyond imagination. The number of attendants is several times the number of tourists. It is located in front of Central Park and is adjacent to the residences of capitalists.</p>
<p>There are more than 60,000 female office workers in New York. Most of them are romantic. Every evening, they put on heavy makeup and gorgeous clothes, and stroll leisurely with young men. On the contrary, the waitresses in restaurants and bars are chaste and dutiful. The reason is not without economic background. The waitresses can earn a small income of 100 to 200 yuan in addition to their monthly salary of 40 to 50 yuan, which is enough to support themselves, while the female office workers only earn a meager salary per month, but they have high aspirations and extravagant habits, so they have to rely on others, adding a historical record to New York's nightlife.</p>
<p>Prostitution is not limited to our country; it is also prevalent in Europe and the United States. New York's prostitutes are not very different, but there is one thing worth mentioning: some brothels only provide housing facilities, which means they are "golden houses without beauties." Another type is the opposite, with beauties but no golden houses.</p>
<p>Opera is a gathering place for New York's nightlife, but the ticket prices are too high, often costing 70 to 80 yuan per person. The poor sigh in despair. Oil tycoon Rockefeller, thinking of the lower classes, donated 60 million US dollars to build a large theater that can accommodate 100,000 people. The ticket price is only 1 to 2 yuan. The theater occupies four blocks on 72nd Street in New York, which can be said to be huge. The engineers have carefully planned the sound and light distribution and the supply of cold and hot air, which is truly a masterpiece of world architecture. Alas! The reason why a civilized country is civilized is also due to human effort. May our countrymen not complain about heaven or blame others, but strive to improve themselves!</p>

<p>— Shi Xun</p>
<p>In the last fifteen years, Liu Haisu has gained the highest authority in the Chinese art world and has had a great influence on recent painters. The ill-fated poet Xu Zhimo said;) ...From Haisu's works, we can see the trend of Haisu's life spirit. He is a man with physique and strength, and he can indeed restrain his innate physique and strength into his works. We cannot deny his broad mind, the development of his artistic conception, and the strength of his brushstrokes. You may not like his works, you may criticize his works from all aspects, but you cannot ignore his creation</p>
<p>the spirit and unique position, he is there, whether it is rough or fine, he is not only there, he also forces you to pay attention, making you unconsciously moved. ...) Xu Zhimo's words are correct, his lines have a unique talent, all his pictures are purely creative structures, and show his great, eternal and outstanding. Although he has been influenced by many masters, he has never lost himself, and his style has always been consistent. Each of his works is clearly showing us his temperament, his nature, the circumstances he encountered, the era he was born in, and the country he is in. That is the hope of boldness, strength, progress, and the new China in the East.</p>
<p>Now his representative work (Notre Dame de Paris at Sunset) is displayed at the exhibition, opposite the (Louvre); this is really the best proportion. The bronze-like color of the (Louvre) and the precise technique, (Notre Dame de Paris at Sunset) the fire-like sunshine and the wild charm, are very different in the eyes of ordinary people, but in fact they are one and two, and two and one, and at the same time can express his character and personality, and write out the secrets of nature.</p>
<p>People think that Liu is good at landscape, but they do not know that he is also good at human body and portrait. We see that most of the portraits he has produced this time, such as (Ma Xiangbo, Thinker) (Mrs. L), etc., a special majestic beauty makes people strange, his flying and vivid strokes can indeed express the deep sensuality and the spiritual joy and depression.</p>
<p>From his landscapes, we can see his depiction of the colors of various places, the brilliance of Venice, the strong colors of Rome, the beauty of the Swiss lakes and mountains, the sun and sunflowers of Belgium, the gray mystery and solemnity of Paris, all of which can give us infinite taste. As for the solidity of his buildings and the naive sense of the characters in the scene, they are all the gains he made after his European tour.</p>

<p>— Seeking Happiness</p>
<p>Lu Boqin was also extremely moved, but there was still a bit of unresolved worry in his heart, and he murmured to Yi Dao;) For the fulfillment of love, we should both be happy. It's just that before entering Yu Pass, the road ahead is still full of thorns, and I don't know if we can escape from this tiger's mouth. If there is any mistake, my life is not worth regretting, but what if it involves you?)</p>
<p>(You are like this again!) Yi let go of her hand and broke away from the embrace, saying very calmly;) When I saw this passport, I regarded it as a formal marriage certificate, and I was very satisfied. Even if I have to go to die immediately, I will still think that my wish has been fulfilled, this life is not in vain, and I will die without regret!)</p>
<p>(Good! You have such great courage for love, why should I still be so cowardly? Let's hold hands and move forward boldly!) Lu Boqin also became excited and still dragged Yi into his arms with one hand. After being tender for a while, he whispered;) But be bold but careful. When we get on the train later, we must be careful.)</p>
<p>This is also where Lu Boqin is precocious and experienced; after he carefully told Tong Yizhen how to take a cautious and calm attitude, when they got on the train together that night, the two of them were calm and generous, very much like a married young couple, without revealing any flaws. Although they passed through several outposts and several teams of Japanese soldiers who were like wolves and tigers, they all passed safely.</p>
<p>After the train started, he and the other postal workers were all in a specially designated third-class carriage. Two Japanese soldiers, holding bayonet-mounted rifles, guarded the front and rear doors of the carriage, not allowing him to walk to other carriages. In addition, the lights in the carriage were also broken, and it was dark and gloomy like in a miserable hell, so they had to lean on each other on a wooden chair, and unknowingly fell asleep</p>

<p>A Humble Proposal for Reforming Chinese School Education Thirteen Cheng Tianfang</p>
<p>It has been written in a rambling way, already more than ten thousand words, before the end of this article, there are still three issues to be discussed incidentally, the first is the atmosphere of learning, the second is physical education, and the third is military training, in the last ten years, the failure of the Chinese learning atmosphere is undeniable, some schools simply live in a storm all year round, not only the maintenance of discipline in the school, the training of group life, can not be talked about at all, even the minimum amount of homework that should be taught, is completely perfunctory, students mixed like this for six years in middle school, they become middle school graduates, mixed like this for four years in university, they become university graduates, the society is full of this kind of middle and university graduates, how can it not be bad, the country and society spend tens of millions of dollars every year to create this kind of people, it is really a heartbreaking thing, so if the learning atmosphere can not be reformed, any good education system can not produce good results, but how to reform it, in the past, the government mostly took a laissez-faire attitude towards student unrest, only in recent months has it strictly implemented sanctions, strict sanctions are naturally necessary, but I think that to reform the learning atmosphere, we must also rely on the efforts of the education community itself, in the past, some schools have experienced unrest, often because the principal and teachers have not been able to fulfill their responsibilities, and even want to use students to do their tools, since the principal and teachers can use students to attack others, students can naturally attack the principal and teachers in turn, so when a school experiences unrest, students are certainly wrong, the principal and teachers can not shirk responsibility, so to really rectify the learning atmosphere, the government's choice of principal, the principal's choice of teachers, must be particularly cautious, do not make people who fill the number, and at the same time the principal and teachers must also deeply understand their own responsibilities, be virtuous and disciplined, set an example, do not have the psychology of using young people, can get the faith of young people, guide young people to develop on the right track, most students in any school are always willing to be good, as long as the teachers and leaders are effective, the learning atmosphere can naturally be prosperous,</p>

<p>Only When It Is Sufficient to Harm the Public or Others</p>
<p>Can a Criminal Charge Be Established</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau previously submitted a request to the Ministry of Education to clarify the penalties for forging academic or graduation certificates. The Executive Yuan consulted the judicial interpretation and resolved through the Unified Interpretation of Laws Conference that, in addition to forging official seals, which constitutes a crime under Article 235, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code, the remaining forgeries of academic or graduation certificates and transcripts, etc., must be sufficient to harm the public or others to constitute a criminal charge. The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau further stated that the meaning of the phrase "must be sufficient to harm the public or others" seemed unclear and requested further clarification. The bureau argued that students who forge academic or graduation certificates to fraudulently obtain student status or positions often infringe upon the opportunities of others to study or serve due to quota limitations. The question was whether this situation should be considered harmful. The Unified Interpretation of Laws Conference resolved yesterday that student academic or graduation certificates or transcripts, etc., cannot be used to obtain student status or positions unless they have been reviewed and deemed authentic. Therefore, forging such documents is not inherently sufficient to cause harm to the public or others and does not constitute a crime. The resolution was sent to the Ministry of Education and forwarded to the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau for compliance. (New Voice Society)</p>

<p>Stating That It Is Better to Run Another School Than to Take It Over</p>
<p>Expresses That Selling Shanghai Middle School Is Feasible</p>
<p>丨Greatly Hopes That the French Concession Authorities Will Subsidize Private Education</p>
<p>(Central News Agency) Yesterday, a Central News Agency reporter specifically visited Pan Gongzhan, the Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, regarding the issue of the concession subsidizing private school funding and the transfer of Jiangsu Provincial Shanghai Middle School. He was kind enough to provide the following comments: (Question) It is rumored that the Provincial Shanghai Middle School will sell its original site. What are your opinions on this matter, Director? (Answer) I have also heard about this matter, but I believe that this matter is not impossible to handle. In the current situation, the sale of all the land of Shanghai Middle School can be worth at least five or six hundred thousand yuan. If we can purchase land and build school buildings in the remote areas of this city, then we can get several times larger than the original one. This is also an economical way. However, I believe that the selection of the new base of Shanghai Middle School should still be within the scope of this city. (Question) Regarding the transfer of Shanghai Middle School, during the time of former Director Xu, a request was submitted to the Municipal Government to ask the Central Government to strive for it. Are you still continuing that proposal? (Answer) I believe that there is no need to strive for this matter. It is not impossible for the Jiangsu Provincial Government to open a school within the scope of this city to supplement the lack of education in this city by contributing money. Moreover, the educational expenses of this city are currently in a difficult situation. In the future, if it is more abundant, it would be more beneficial to start a middle school separately than to take over Shanghai Middle School. Although I am a local official, I should still think about the entire country. (Question) The Shanghai Public Concession has already obtained the consent of the Public Concession authorities to subsidize the funding of private schools in the Concession. However, the French Concession levies heavier taxes on citizens than the Public Concession, and the educational undertakings run by Chinese people are less than the Public Concession. What opinions do you have on this matter, Director? (Answer) The reason why the Public Concession was able to propose a part of the funding to subsidize the private schools of the Chinese people in the past was actually due to the efforts of the Chinese Directors in the Concession. Therefore, I hope that the Chinese Directors in the French Concession can also base on this spirit and strive for it from the French Public Concession Bureau.</p>

<p>Chairman Mayor Wu's Exhortation: Officials of the Shanghai Elementary School Joint Sports Meet, elementary school students of Shanghai, we Chinese citizens must now save the nation. But what methods should we use? Are these methods effective? From our current perspective, saving the nation requires strengthening the race. If the race is strong, the nation will naturally be strong. Therefore, we pay attention to strengthening the race. This will not only save the nation but also make the country stronger day by day. Strengthening the race depends on education. The government and society must bear the responsibility of education and fulfill the way of education. If we bear the responsibility of education and fulfill the way of education, we will have good citizens. With good citizens, we will have a good government. With a good government, we can have good politics. With good politics, we can make the country stronger. Today's sports meet is the government fulfilling its responsibility of education, fulfilling the way of education, so that you elementary school students will all become sound citizens. You elementary school students must know the current danger of the nation and the difficulties our ancestors faced in founding the nation. Train your sound bodies to save the nation and preserve the land and all undertakings left to us by our ancestors.</p>
<p>Chairman Bureau Chief Pan's Report: This session of the Elementary School Joint Sports Meet is the fourth. It was originally scheduled to be held last autumn, but was temporarily suspended due to the Jingbei Incident. This time, in mid-September, we received approval from the municipal government and allocated funds to hold it. Preparations began on September 26th, establishing the rules and notifying the schools. The preparations have taken just over a month. This time, a total of 105 elementary schools are participating in the event, including 72 municipal schools and 33 private schools. There are 1,800 male and female track and field athletes, and over 4,000 participants in the group exercises. The event program, in addition to this morning's drill, includes male and female track and field events and group exercises. The group exercises are further divided into male and female rhythmic gymnastics, kindergarten student performances, and four types of national martial arts. The male and female track and field events are divided into four groups: A, B, C, and D, so that all elementary school students can participate. The event will last for three days, followed by a one-day public amateur sports meet on the 30th. The number of participants in this session is more than before and more enthusiastic than before, which shows that they have been stimulated by the national crisis and know that it is necessary to exercise. This time, we are very grateful for the awards given by all parties and for the help from the Public Security Bureau, the Public Utilities Bureau, and the Health Bureau.</p>
<p>Municipal Party Representative Cai Hongtian's Speech: Today is the Shanghai Elementary School Sports Meet. I am very honored to participate on behalf of the municipal party. We have two hopes for you today: (1) Sports competitions should only be a means, and the goal is exercise. Winning or losing is not important. Those who win should continue to work hard, and those who lose should not be discouraged but should work even harder. (2) The purpose of the sports meet is to exercise the body. You are participating to exercise, so I hope you will continue to exercise after the sports meet. Finally, I wish you all good health.</p>
<p>Bureau Chief of Health Li Ting'an's Speech: I am very honored to participate in this sports meet today. China is now in great danger. Saving the nation does not depend on money but on people, and on people's bodies. This sports meet is being held to promote physical education and to exercise your bodies. I hope you will work hard and each become a sound citizen to serve the nation in the future.</p>
<p>丨Excellent Results in Group Exercises丨</p>

Among them, the vigorous and healthy Eight-Section Brocade of Chengzhong, the orderly short-stick exercises of Wanzhu, the agile gymnastics of the Qunxue Deaf-Mute School, and the accurate and lively mimetic exercises of He'an Track and Field School were all top choices.

It is hereby pre-determined that if it is still raining at 8:00 AM on the 28th, the meeting will be suspended for the day, and the meeting will be postponed for one day. All participating schools and athletes should not attend the meeting to avoid futile trips. The amateur sports meet will still be held on the 30th as scheduled. This notice is hereby issued for public knowledge.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Datong Wins Basketball Charity Match Against Fudan <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The Datong University basketball team, at the invitation of the Fudan University basketball team, held a charity match at the Fudan basketball gymnasium yesterday. At 7:30 PM, with Wu Shijie's whistle, the two sides began to compete. Datong took the lead and scored first. Fudan was unwilling to be outdone, taking advantage of opportunities to move, and with the different momentum of the home and away teams, the score increased frequently. In the first half, they took the lead with a score of 20 to 10. As the second half began, Datong changed its strategy and reorganized its lineup. Interception and throwing were both successful. As a result, the victory belonged to Datong with a score of 30 to 29.</p>
<p>Basketball New Techniques (20) (2) (Not Allowed) (Reprinted) Original work by Claire Burcky, translated and compiled by Zhang Guodong and Qian Yiqin</p>
<p>Can you recall Connie Mack and athlete Harvey Freeman? He invented a continuous rotation attack method to win the Michigan State C-level championship twice. The tactics are shown below.</p>
<p>Number one passes the ball to number two and immediately runs to the baseline. If he can escape the surveillance of the guard, number two can still pass the ball back to number one. However, under this circumstance, number one's guard will inevitably watch him extra closely. Then two people (number one and his guard) will just block number two's guard, giving number two a good opportunity to dribble forward and shoot. If number two is blocked by the opponent under the basket and cannot shoot, then he can pass to number four or number five who can get rid of his guard. This type of rotating attack uses the situation to control the ball and is consistent throughout, not stopping until the opponent's guard relaxes on his own. It is truly an attack that combines wisdom and courage.</p>

<p>The Shanghai office of the Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang People's Support Association received a cable yesterday from the director of the headquarters, stating: We have received a cable from Li Du stating that since the first day of this month, over 700 Japanese troops and over 1,000 puppet Manchurian troops, via Jiamusi and Tulongshan, have advanced towards our defenses in Sandao Gang, Erdao Hezi, and Boli. Our troops, led by Chen Zongdai and a part of the 24th Brigade, met them head-on with a fierce attack. After seven days and nights of fierce fighting, our 26th Brigade reinforced them. The enemy's momentum could not withstand it, and they collapsed towards Yilan. Details will be reported separately. This is specially reported for your information.</p>
<h3 id="e110">退伍 Soldiers of the 61st Division Form Suicide Squad <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Volunteering to go to Northeast China to Resist Japan and Save the Nation</p>
<p>According to the Huadong News Agency, Ouyang Zhiping and others, retired soldiers of the 61st Division of the 19th Route Army, have organized a suicide squad to resist Japan and save the nation and are about to depart. Yesterday, they issued a declaration stating: The violent Japanese, with their East Asian continental policy, use their sharp cannons as a vanguard. Last year, on September 18th, they captured Liaoning and Jilin. This spring, on January 28th, they attacked our Songhu. Although our army met them head-on in the Battle of Songhu, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy, the enemy had no choice but to comply with the agreement and endure their loss of troops and retreat north. However, the powerful neighboring Japanese, not only did not repent of their evil deeds but also became even more intensified. Now, they have moved the troops from Songhu, devoting all their strength to threatening our Northeast volunteer army as much as possible, intending to support puppets to achieve their final goal of the Manchurian policy. At the same time, they are attacking Rehe and harassing the security of Pingjin to disrupt world public opinion. Our government's countermeasures, at this time when volunteer armies are arising one after another, the war clouds are densely covering Rehe, and the momentum is urgent. We have witnessed enemy planes in Songhu, suffered from the bombing of huge bombs, and heard the sounds of fierce cannons and loud shouts of killing. We have long understood the enemy's magic weapons and the abilities of their soldiers. How can we allow them to hide their flags and silence their drums here, silently sucking our blood? How can we sit idly by and watch Rehe become the second Shenyang, allowing it to fall? And the cries of suffering from our Northeast compatriots, and the weeping and wailing sounds of the anti-Japanese martyrs, how can we turn a deaf ear? Otherwise, if our Chinese nation wants to seek its survival, recover lost territory, and avenge its humiliation, it can only fight desperately, strive to the death, and resist to the end. The Northeast volunteer army is looking forward to increasing the front line, adding infantry, and preparing for a counterattack. The Rehe side is especially awaiting assistance to make a fierce resistance. Under these circumstances, we anti-Japanese soldiers have only our bodies and lives. We must intensify the anti-Japanese movement, and continue to fight a life-and-death battle with the enemy. Now, we and our comrades vow to use our blood and heads to resolve to go north to aid Rehe, or to leave the pass and work together with the Northeast volunteer army to resist Japan and save the nation. We will fight together for our national mission. This is our solemn declaration.</p>

<p>Meeting with Zhang Qun to Discuss Matters</p>
<p>Xu Yongchang, Chairman of the Shanxi Provincial Government, went from Jin to Han this time to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to discuss matters. He has already completed his official business and passed through Nanjing to Shanghai the day before yesterday.

<h3 id="e112">Mr. Yan Ziduan's Talk on Developing the Northwest <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The first batch of members of the Northwest Reclamation Corps returned to Shanghai a few days ago. Details have already been recorded in this newspaper. However, the head of the corps, Mr. Yan Ziduan, delayed his return to Shanghai until yesterday because he still needed to liaise with various sectors along the way. According to Mr. Yan, he led twenty corps members from Shanghai on August 1st. They traveled via the capital to the Jinpu Railway to Jinan, then through Tianjin to Beijing. After staying in Beijing for several days, they transferred to the Pingsui Railway, passing through Suiyuan and other places, and arrived at their destination, Baotou. They then set up an office on Qianmen Street in Baotou to facilitate communication with the headquarters in Shanghai. They spent over forty days in Baotou investigating reclamation. Because there were matters to attend to in Shanghai, he sent a standing team to Baotou and led a small number of comrades back to Shanghai. He plans to make a second expedition next spring. The land in Suiyuan is particularly fertile, especially the Hetao area. Hetao includes the three counties of Wuyuan, Linhe, and Dayutai, with Wuyuan as the center. Wuyuan straddles the Yellow River, divided into two parts, one outside the loop and one inside the loop. The total area of the county is 388,000 square miles. The terrain is flat, and most of it is suitable for farming, with the Hetao area being the most fertile. The main products are fur and livestock. Guihua and Baotou are the central locations for exporting these goods. More than ten foreign companies have established shops there to purchase wool, cashmere, cowhides, and horse hides. It is estimated that Guihua exports over 7 million pieces of leather, over 8 million catties of wool and cashmere, and 60,000 to 70,000 heads of livestock each year. The number of exports from Baotou is even greater. In addition, mineral resources are abundant, with salt ponds and coal as the main commodities. Salt ponds are mostly located in the Ordos region, and coal is distributed in the Daqingshan Mountains. According to geological surveys, there are reserves of 650 million tons of anthracite coal and 1.3 billion tons of bituminous coal. The richness of the geology is evident. Other aspects are too numerous to be described at one time. In short, developing the Northwest is the most important task of the day. In recent years, internal wars have continued, and disasters have been frequent. In addition, the violent Japanese have looted the Northeast. The people in the war zones and disaster areas who have been ruined are unprecedented in nearly sixty years. The old fill the gullies, and the young become bandits, forming a chaotic situation in China. If the Northwest can be reclaimed, it would be a good way to settle refugees from the disaster areas.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Beixin Bookstore Vandalized Yesterday <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Losses Estimated at Over a Thousand Yuan</p>
<p>The Bookstore Temporarily Suspended Operations</p>
<p>According to a Central News Agency report, around noon yesterday, the distribution office of the Beixin Bookstore on Fuzhou Road was suddenly vandalized by a group of over thirty people speaking with Northern accents, causing losses of over a thousand yuan. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Details of the Vandalism: At the time, about thirty people arrived at the bookstore, some in cars and some in rickshaws. After gathering at the entrance, more than ten people remained guarding outside the shop, while more than ten people rushed into the shop and asked if they had "Little Pigsy" for sale. The store had previously stopped selling the book after it caused offense to Muslims, who had negotiated with the bookstore. When someone asked to buy it, Zhao Shiyuan, the acting director of the bookstore's retail department, politely replied that the book was no longer for sale and that all remaining copies had been stored away. The group then asked to see the manager. Zhao replied that the manager was out. A verbal conflict ensued, and order was lost. The six bookstore employees were having lunch at a table. The group overturned the table, shattering bowls and dishes on the floor. The employees fled in different directions. The group then pulled out iron bars and smashed all the glass in the bookshelves. Those guarding outside the store simultaneously smashed all three large pieces of glass in the outer display windows. Zhao Shiyuan, the acting director of the bookstore, in desperation, ran out of the store and blew a police whistle borrowed from a nearby shop. Upon hearing the sound, the group jumped into cars and rickshaws and fled. By the time the police arrived, no one was left. The bookstore then closed its iron gates and temporarily suspended operations.</p>
<p>Muslims Express Their Views: After the incident, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency visited several Muslim leaders and officials of the Muslim Association, including Ma Xingzhong. According to Mr. Ma, he did not know that the Beixin Bookstore had been vandalized, and he did not believe that Muslims were responsible. He said that Muslims were well-organized and extremely obedient to the orders of their leaders. He added that Muslims had repeatedly held meetings to discuss the offensive text published by the Beixin Bookstore and had already decided to retain lawyer Wu Kaisheng to negotiate according to the law and would never take any further drastic actions.</p>
<p>Statement from the Bookstore: Zhao Shiyuan, the acting director of the Beixin Bookstore's retail department, told a reporter from the Central News Agency that the bookstore had received a letter of negotiation from lawyer Wu Kaisheng on behalf of the mosques three days ago and had stored away the book and stopped selling it, willing to await a legal solution. At the same time, the bookstore's wholesale department on Qipu Road also received a warning letter asking the bookstore and its manager to be careful. The bookstore reported the letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Station for filing. Unexpectedly, the next day (i.e., the day before yesterday), at around 7:00 PM, a brick tied with grass rope was thrown into the retail department, breaking the glass window in the center. Today (i.e., yesterday), it was vandalized again, which was very unfortunate. The display windows are completely destroyed, and it will not be possible to resume business for several days. The damaged glass and musical instruments consigned by the Datong Music Society are worth over a thousand yuan. Police officers have come to investigate and have taken away an iron bar left behind by the group. Police officers are also protecting the wholesale department on Qipu Road.</p>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency's investigation yesterday, the incident was believed to have been triggered by the bookstore's publication of the book "Little Pigsy." When the bookstore published the book, it was entirely based on descriptions in "Journey to the West" with added embellishments. It did not initially consider offending Muslims and therefore sold the book. A week ago, the bookstore received a letter from Muslims, and someone came to the bookstore requesting that the book be removed from sale and destroyed. The wholesale department on Qipu Road then retrieved the book and stopped selling it. However, the request for a public apology was not fulfilled.</p>
<p>Details of the Negotiations: The Muslim mosques in Fuyou Road, Nanmen, Rihuigang, Xieqiao, Xiaotaoyuan, Pudong, Xiaoshadu, Taopeng Road, Zhejiang Road, and Gordon Road, all believed that the book "Little Pigsy" was offensive to Islam. They jointly retained lawyer Wu Kaisheng to negotiate with the Beixin Bookstore. After accepting the case, lawyer Wu sent a letter to the Beixin Bookstore the day before yesterday to initiate negotiations. After receiving the letter, the bookstore appointed lawyer Wei Wenhan to go to the joint office of the Muslim mosques yesterday to discuss a settlement, but without success. At the same time, the joint office of the Muslim mosques dispatched representatives to the municipal government around 3:00 PM yesterday to petition for strict handling of the matter and planned to go to Nanjing within days to petition the central government.</p>
<p>Text of the Petition: Da Pusheng, the Imam of the Fuyou Road Mosque in Shanghai, and others, separately presented petitions to the National Government, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Interior, and various ministries, requesting punishment for the Beixin Bookstore. The original text reads: (Titles omitted) "In recent years, our country has been plagued by internal strife and increasing foreign aggression. The people are in turmoil, and the nation is in a precarious state. At this critical moment of survival, we must rely on the harmony of the people and promote unity to consolidate the spirit of all five ethnic groups and suppress internal and external threats so that the country can achieve peace. Unexpectedly, the Beixin Bookstore in Shanghai recently published a book called 'Little Pigsy,' which claims that Pigsy is the ancestor of Muslims and that Muslims are Little Pigsy. The book contains arbitrary insults and obscene content. The cover of the book features an ugly image of Pigsy printed in red to attract attention. Upon reading the book, Muslims in Shanghai were shocked. They believe that the bookstore deliberately intends to provoke the 50 million Muslims in the country, to instigate ethnic hatred between the Han and Hui people, and to create turmoil in the Northwest, so that the country cannot attend to internal affairs and achieve its goal of division and discord. Its malicious intention is truly profound and concerning for the future of China. The Muslims have no dealings with this bookstore. Why must it publish such a red book, defaming Muslims so severely? What is the intention behind inciting the Muslim community? We Muslims deeply understand the greater picture. We lodged complaints with the mosques in Shanghai. Although they harbor righteous indignation, they are all willing to obey the orders of the imams and seek redress from your Excellencies through proper channels. Representatives of the mosques have been meeting and discussing for days, carefully considering the matter. They believe that the bookstore's publication is an insult to individual Muslims, which can be addressed by ordinary laws. However, the insult is to Muslims both in China and abroad. There are no fewer than 50 million Muslims in China, and countless others who believe in Islam in other countries. Can they all endure this silently? It will inevitably lead to conflicts between the two religions, as in India and the provinces of Xinjiang. Even within Shanghai alone, there are no fewer than 100,000 Muslims. What method can be used to suppress their resentment? China is now in an extremely weak state, relying entirely on the unity of the five ethnic groups since the beginning of the revolution to consolidate the nation. Unfortunately, there are already groups among the ethnic groups that are splitting apart. The Muslim community wholeheartedly aims to save the world, and the patriotic armies mostly consist of courageous men. If the bookstore so offends the Muslim community, what if the entire community is disheartened and, after deep consideration, turns against the nation and neglects its defenses? The great disaster of a wildfire starting from a small spark will be this book's legacy. This is what we feel is dangerous, and we dare not refrain from speaking our minds earnestly. The original book has been submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Government for review. We respectfully submit this petition, imploring your Excellencies to telegraph the Shanghai Municipal Government to investigate the case and to investigate whether the bookstore has committed any crimes against national security in its previous publications to prove its intention to incite the Muslim community this time. As for this book, which endangers the public, the case is serious. What kind of national law should be applied is not something that the mosques dare to presume. The mosques have always maintained peace and followed the teachings of the scriptures, always remaining calm. Therefore, we endure humiliation and submit these humble words. How to appease the anger of the Muslims and how to alleviate the worries of the country is something that your Excellencies understand as clearly as the blue sky, and it does not require the mosques or the Muslims to make any requests. Furthermore, the editors of the book are Lin Lan, Zhu Yangshan, and the distributors are Li Zhiyun and Li Xiaofeng, all of whom are listed in the book. We submit this petition with grief and imploring sincerity."

<h3 id="e116">Czech Nationals Celebrate Independence Day Today <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Today is the 14th anniversary of Czechoslovakia's declaration of independence. The Czech Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Le Faer, will lead the Czech nationals in a grand celebration. The Slavs established their country on this land as early as the 7th century, and the Kingdom of Bohemia in the Czech Republic was also very prosperous in the 14th century. In the 16th century, the Habsburg Dynasty also became the Kingdom of Bohemia, and then merged with Austria to form the United Kingdom. Later, due to the discrimination and abuse of the Austrian King, the Czechs and Slavs revived the idea of ​​national restoration. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, there was a movement for national restoration. When the European War broke out, the Czechoslovak National Committee was established in Paris. The current President Masaryk and Foreign Minister Beneš were both key figures in the committee at that time. They immediately recruited Czech nationals and formed an army to assist the Allied countries in France, Russia, and Italy, with outstanding achievements. In June 1918, the National Committee was recognized internationally as the future government of Czechoslovakia, and the Czechoslovak army was also recognized as the official Allied army participating in the war. On October 14 of the same year, the Czechoslovak Declaration of Independence was signed in Paris, and four days later, the Czechoslovak Declaration of Independence was issued by Masaryk. Ten days later, the Declaration of Independence was issued in Prague. The Provisional Government moved back to the country, opened a parliament, drafted a constitution, and elected Masaryk as president. Although the country has not been established for a long time, the people are united, the foundation of the country is solid, and industry and commerce are thriving, full of the vitality of a new country, and the future is promising.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Reforming Customs Administration Issues <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Representatives Petition with Satisfaction</p>
<p>According to a New Voice News Agency report from Nanjing on the 27th, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce believes that under the current customs administration, the customs commissioner can impose heavy fines with unilateral command. Since there is no grace period for execution and no remedy for appeals, it has dispatched representatives Lu Wenshao, Jin Runxiang, Tu Kaizheng, Zheng Zenan, Zhuang Honggao, Shi Zongtang, and Xie Zhongle to Nanjing on the morning of the 12th to petition the Central Party Headquarters, the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry. It requested that customs laws be formulated as soon as possible, and that detailed regulations be made on the procedures for penalties for tax evasion, remedies for dissatisfaction with rulings, and restrictions on the use of fines. It is heard that the central government appreciated the requests of the petition representatives and agreed that the responsible departments would start planning immediately. The petition representatives also petitioned the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance to strictly define the scope of customs anti-smuggling measures and to effectively stop recent bizarre actions. The ministries all agreed to investigate thoroughly to ensure that the people are not disturbed and that business development is not hindered. The representatives considered this satisfactory.</p>
<p>Statements from Responsible Personnel at the Jianghai Customs</p>
<p>According to a Central News Agency report, more than 100 trade associations in Shanghai expressed resentment over the Jianghai Customs' search for tax-evading goods, including searching shops, moving goods, and arbitrarily imposing fines. They sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to convene a general meeting to make a decision and dispatch representatives to Nanjing the day before yesterday to request reform of customs administration. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited the responsible personnel at the Jianghai Customs yesterday to inquire about the above-mentioned issues. According to them, searching for tax evasion is the responsibility of customs officials. Merchants should pay taxes in accordance with the tax regulations. Those who seek petty profits, violate the regulations, and smuggle and evade taxes have been repeatedly investigated and punished. There are also many who have not been caught smuggling. The customs authorities have to carry out strict searches in order to rectify the national treasury revenue. As for entering shops to search, they will of course obtain considerable evidence and notify the court of the district in advance. The court will transfer a document to the police station, and customs officers will go to search together. This is an extremely legitimate method and the necessary procedure for customs officers to search for tax-evading goods. They hope that merchants will understand this point and hope that they will pay taxes in accordance with the tax regulations. As for reforming customs administration, this is another issue. If the public believes that the current customs administration needs to be reformed, they should petition the National Government for reform. The reporter also asked that if a merchant is found to have evaded taxes and believes that the customs' penalty is too heavy and disagrees with the ruling, what remedies are available? According to the reply, remedies for disagreeing with the customs' ruling is also one of the reasons why Shanghai merchants are requesting reform of customs administration. According to regulations, if the customs finds tax-evading goods, it will impose a fine of several times the value of the goods. As a result, merchants deliberately reduce the value of the seized goods in order to reduce the fine. The so-called disagreement with the ruling is this point. Attempting to reduce the fine is human nature. However, customs has a lot of experience in assessing the value of goods. As for the restrictions on penalties for tax evasion, etc., customs already has clear regulations.</p>

<p>A reporter from the Central News Agency met with the new Director of the Bureau of Health, Li Ting'an, at the Municipal Government yesterday. According to him, since he has just taken office, he is not yet willing to talk much about his views on reforming Shanghai's health. As for the 20,000 yuan subsidy from the American oil magnate Rockefeller, although it has been suspended, he is very familiar with Rockefeller and plans to restore it in the shortest possible time. He is confident that this will be possible. The subsidy will be used specifically for school health and rural health. As for the municipal hospital plan drafted by former Director Hu, he will continue to work hard to carry it out. The city has a dense population, and special attention should be paid to this important health facility. Although the city's treasury is depleted, he will try his best to find ways to complete the plan as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Monthly Donation of 2,900 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the Northeast Refugee Relief Association launched the monthly donation campaign and announced its declaration, all sectors have responded and competed to be the first. Yesterday, the association received a letter from the China Merchants Yarn and Cloth Exchange, stipulating seven monthly donation methods: (1) Employees with salaries of 25 yuan or less can donate or not as they wish; (2) Those with 26 yuan to 50 yuan donate 1% of their monthly salary; (3) Those with 50 yuan to 75 yuan donate 2% of their monthly salary; (4) Those with 75 yuan to 100 yuan donate 3% of their monthly salary; (5) Those with 100 yuan or more donate 5% of their monthly salary; (6) The exchange doubles the total amount donated by employees; (7) The 70 brokers in the exchange assume that each donates 30 yuan. According to this method, employees can donate 400 yuan per month, and the exchange donates the same amount. Assuming that brokers donate 2,100 yuan, the total monthly donation is 2,900 yuan. Once a certain amount has been collected, it will be remitted to the bank on a monthly basis. This method of the exchange is thorough and fair. Not only is it enthusiastic about relief and advocates for all sectors, but it can also be imitated by companies and institutions.</p>

<p>Brigadier General Weng Zhaoyuan, the national hero who bravely defended Wusong with the 19th Route Army, will soon represent the China Aviation Construction Association to negotiate with overseas Chinese communities for the construction of China's aviation program to strengthen national defense and alleviate national crisis. However, the organization and equipment within the country require significant funding. He recently sent a letter to the Special District Office for the Rickshaw Industry seeking assistance. Upon receiving the letter, which coincided with the autumn members' general meeting and dinner at the Xiangbin Restaurant on Guangxi Road, the temporary chairman, Mr. Liang Ruiting, submitted it to all attending members for their support. Committee members including Director Gu Songmao, Yin Zhiling, Zhu Hebi, Xia Muyao, and Hou Shaoan successively voiced their opinions, all agreeing that the nation was facing a crisis and aviation equipment was extremely urgent. They recalled that the Battle of Zhabei was lost due to the lack of air force. If the country falls, the homes will be destroyed, and how can our rickshaw industry survive alone? They called for raising funds for aviation construction to equip the air force specifically for resisting foreign aggression and not for internal strife, stating that it was the duty of citizens. All rickshaw operators also publicly elected Yin, Gu, Zhu, Xia, and Hou as representatives for the meeting. As a result, they voluntarily agreed to donate to aviation construction for six months. In the first month, each rickshaw would donate one yuan, and in the second to sixth months, each rickshaw would donate half a yuan per month. The donations would be collected simultaneously with the November donation payment. Cai Qingtao, Yin Zhiling, Hou Shaoan, Xia Muyao, and Zhu Hebi were publicly elected as custodian committee members, responsible for safekeeping and depositing the funds in banks, converting them into whole sums, and notifying the Aviation Construction Association for disbursement and equipment, serving as aviation construction funds. A letter has already been sent to the association for verification. It is expected that all industry associations in Shanghai are enthusiastic and patriotic, and will definitely not be stingy, watching the country and homes fall, while the Special District Office for the Rickshaw Industry continues to exist.</p>

<h3 id="e131">Chamber of Commerce Telegraphs Ministry of Finance to Correct Customs Declaration for Civilian Ships Carrying Goods <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The "Suzhou-Hangzhou Regulations" Refer to Tugboats</p>
<p>Cannot Include Ordinary Civilian Ships</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce previously received a letter from the Jiaxing County Chamber of Commerce stating that the county's North-South Goods Industry, Paper Industry, Medicine and Pigment Industry, Silk and Cloth Industry, Beijing-Guangdong Goods Industry, and Eight Fresh Earth Products Industry associations reported that two cargo ships, Miao Songrong and Qia Shengxiang, traveling between Shanghai and Jiaxing, were detained by the Jianghai Customs, who demanded supplementary customs declaration procedures. This appeared to be a deliberate attempt to create difficulties. They requested assistance to advocate for their release. The Chamber of Commerce investigated and found that civilian ships transporting goods to the interior had always declared and paid taxes at the Changguan (local customs) and Goods Donation Bureau. Since the explicit order to abolish lijin (internal transit tax), all Changguan and Goods Donation Bureaus were abolished, and no clear order had been received stating that civilian ships transporting goods should declare taxes at the maritime customs. Before an explicit announcement was made, suddenly detaining ships and demanding customs declarations understandably caused merchants to protest. The Chamber of Commerce immediately sent a letter to the Jianghai Customs Superintendent's Office, requesting them to quickly inform the Taxation Department to release the detained ships. At the same time, twelve industry associations in Shanghai, including the Jingye, North Goods, Luzun, Bai, Guanyuan, Seafood, Domestic Pigments, Oilseed, Fruit and Earth Products, Fresh Fish, and Sesame and Sesame Oil groups, jointly sent a letter requesting their release, as there had never been such procedures before. Later, the Chamber of Commerce received a reply from the Jianghai Customs Superintendent's Office, forwarded by the Taxation Department, stating that it was handled according to the Suzhou-Hangzhou Regulations. The Chamber of Commerce argued that the Suzhou-Hangzhou Regulations refer to civilian ships towed by steamships carrying goods, not all civilian ships. Yesterday, it also sent a special telegram to the Ministry of Finance requesting a correction. The following are the texts of the various letters and telegrams:</p>
<p>Reply from Jianghai Customs: "Respected Sirs, we have received your letter No. 181 stating that the Sugar Industry and North Goods groups have sent a letter requesting the prompt release of the civilian cargo ships Miao Songrong and Qia Shengxiang, which travel between Shanghai and Jiaxing, to avoid losses. You requested us to expedite the matter and to provide a copy of any explicit order requiring civilian ships transporting goods to declare taxes at the customs. After checking with the relevant departments regarding this matter, we received a reply from the Taxation Department stating that civilian ships traveling between Shanghai and Suzhou-Hangzhou should be handled according to the long-established Suzhou-Hangzhou Regulations. The customs office has already explained this situation in detail to the representatives of the Jiaxing County Chamber of Commerce. We are replying to inform you. Please acknowledge and inform others."</p>
<p>Telegram to the Ministry of Finance: "Respectfully to the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, regarding the case of the Jianghai Customs detaining the two civilian ships Miao Songrong and Qia Shengxiang, this Chamber has already telegraphed and appealed on October 19th. The Shanghai Customs replied, still citing the long-established regulations for Chinese ships traveling between Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Shanghai carrying passengers and goods. Although articles 5 to 12 of these regulations contain provisions for civilian ships to declare, register, and pay taxes to the customs, according to article 1 of these regulations, these civilian ships refer to civilian ships towed by steamships carrying goods, not ordinary civilian ships. Therefore, the title of the regulations is 'Regulations for Chinese Ships Traveling between Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Shanghai Carrying Passengers and Goods.' The title of the regulations defines the scope of civilian ships. The customs offices and lijin stations each have their own jurisdiction. Civilian ships are taxed by lijin stations or Changguan, while steamships are taxed by maritime customs. This has been the practice for a long time. If the Shanghai Customs' current claim is followed, regardless of the type of civilian ship, customs duties must be declared and paid to the customs. Then, since the opening of customs in Suzhou and Hangzhou in the 21st year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, the lijin stations there would have had no taxes to collect and should have been abolished long ago, why wait until today? Now, the customs is taking advantage of the abolishment of lijin to expand its jurisdiction to civilian ships that are not towed by steamships. This has no legal basis and makes the policy of abolishing lijin a mere formality. We urgently telegraph to the Ministry for a clear explanation, ordering the customs to correct their actions, as this is in the public interest. Respectfully, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce."</p>

<p>The China Jisheng Society recently received successive letters and telegrams from relief directors in various regions. For example, Mr. Wang Jishi in Wugong stated that the 3,000 yuan seed relief fund was still insufficient, and the lacquer Wei Shan bridge and bridge construction urgently needed funds. Also, the 8,000 yuan seed relief fund in Tanghe and Deng Counties in southern Henan was being distributed. According to a letter from Mr. Yao Chongbang, it would not be easy to cope without more than 10,000 yuan. Mr. Li Yunmen, the construction director of the Dayou and Fuyou embankments in Jiangxi, wrote that he urgently needed a further allocation of 10,000 yuan to facilitate construction while the water level was low. Furthermore, Mr. Zhou Jingfu and Mr. Yu Guisheng in Beiping wrote repeatedly that the Society has been running soup kitchens in Beiping for six years. At its peak, it had six locations. This year, Northeastern refugees gathered, and the number of poor people in Beiping and Tianjin has increased several times. Various sectors have appealed to the Society to continue running at least two soup kitchens to benefit the disaster victims. The Society holds a winter relief effort in this city every year, but this year, after the January 28th Incident, war-torn refugees have been devastated. The winter relief cotton clothing to be distributed will definitely increase compared to last year. However, the Society's finances have a huge deficit, so it is unable to meet various requests for relief. Therefore, it is scheduled to hold a standing committee meeting on relief on November 1st to discuss everything. The Society's recent relief efforts have focused on water conservancy and farmland, using work as a form of relief, to supplement the inadequacy of the rural economy. Cultivating the rural economy can eliminate the source of turmoil. It is hoped that this is welcomed by patriotic people.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Ministry of Finance Approves Tax Collection Methods for Local Indigo <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce received a reply from the Ministry of Finance, which stated, "We have received your submission. After investigation, the re-export tax levied by customs on local indigo sold domestically is 1 tael and 5 qian of customs silver per dan, equivalent to 2 yuan and 2 jiao and 5 fen in foreign currency. However, imported indigo is taxed at 14 gold units per dan according to the new tax rate, which is equivalent to about 28 yuan in foreign currency based on the market price. The difference between the two is significant. Moreover, the re-export tax is levied on all local goods that pass through customs, and local indigo should be treated the same. As for the Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangxi and other indigo-producing provinces' various kinds of levies, which have not been completely eliminated as mentioned in the original submission, in addition to instructing the finance departments of Guangdong, Fujian and Jiangxi to investigate and report back, it is hereby ordered that you be informed."</p>

<h3 id="e136">Dockworkers at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Wharf Demand Pay <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Work Slowdown Occurs</p>
<p>Mediation and Reconciliation</p>
<p>Yesterday, the dockworkers and other employees of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company engaged in a work slowdown because they were owed wages. They sent representatives to the company to demand payment, while also engaging in a work slowdown. Subsequently, the heads of various departments intervened to mediate and promised to raise funds for payment. The situation was temporarily resolved. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Dockworkers Demand Pay at Five Wharves: The employees and workers at the five wharves of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, including Jin Liyuan, Yangjiadu, Zhongzhan, Beizhan, and Huazhan, and the staff in the warehouses, have not yet received their salaries for September. Yesterday afternoon, the five wharves jointly elected more than thirty employee representatives to go to the headquarters to demand payment from the accounting department. At the same time, all five wharves uniformly engaged in a work slowdown and would not resume work until they received their salaries. The section chief of the general affairs department came forward to meet them. The employee representatives stated that the employees' lives were difficult and unsustainable. If they were not paid, they would have no choice but to strike completely and sit at the company to demand payment. The section chief of the general affairs department accepted the representatives' request but explained that since the government sent personnel to thoroughly investigate the accounts, the banks were hesitant to pay out any funds. Even the company's employees have not been paid. This was not discrimination against the wharves. He hoped that the representatives would persuade the wharf workers not to continue the work slowdown. He promised that they would definitely raise funds to pay the September salaries by the end of this month. The representatives demanded that the section chief take responsibility before returning to their wharves. If the salaries were not paid by the end of the month, the five wharves would strike together. The matter was resolved at 5:30 PM, and they will resume normal work today.</p>
<p>Negotiations by Ship Crew: The company's ocean liners Jiahe and Gongping, etc., arrived in Shanghai from the north and south. The shipping department assigned the two ships to depart immediately for foreign ports. The officers, firefighters, and sailors demanded their wages from the company. Since the ships were leaving port, everyone needed to provide for their families first. They had been owed wages for two months, and did not know how they could live. The crews of both ships went to the company to demand payment from the accounting department. The accounting department had no funds to pay. The Jiahe and Gongping immediately engaged in a work slowdown, stopping the acceptance of passengers and goods, and sat at the company to demand payment. They said that the crew members had risked their lives at sea to produce for the company, but their wages had been owed for a long time. Unless they received their wages, they would not start work. The situation almost broke down. Later, the head of the shipping department stepped in to mediate, saying that the ships that were leaving port should be paid first so that the crew members could provide for their families. He urged them to resume work while negotiating with the accounting department to pay the salaries of the Gongping, Jiahe, and other ships as soon as possible, to avoid work slowdowns, delays, and disruption to transportation. The matter was resolved late in the evening.</p>

<h3 id="e138">Judgement on Yuan An and Zhong Wei's Ship Charter Termination <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The Sino-Japanese Incident Has Indeed Constituted War</p>
<p>Yuan An Wins Lawsuit; Zhong Wei Must Return All Payments</p>
<p>The Yuan An Steamship Company and the Shanghai Zhong Wei Steamship Company, due to the termination of a ship charter agreement, raised the question of whether the January 28th Japanese attack on Shanghai constituted a formal war. The Yuan An Company had signed a long-term ship charter agreement with Zhong Wei Company on December 5th of last year, whereby Zhong Wei leased the "Taiping" steamship, with a deadweight of 3,500 tons, to Yuan An for cargo transport at a monthly rental of 13,500 yuan, payable in advance monthly. The agreement stipulated that if war broke out between China and any country, affecting the agreement in any way, either party could terminate it. However, only two days after Yuan An prepaid the second installment of rent, the January 28th Incident suddenly occurred. Therefore, on February 3rd, based on the terms of the agreement, Yuan An notified Zhong Wei of the contract termination. At that time, the "Taiping" steamship was in Tanggu transporting cargo, and Yuan An specifically telegraphed the captain to remain under Zhong Wei's command. However, Zhong Wei Company completely disagreed with Yuan An's claims. They argued that although there were hostile acts between China and Japan, no formal declaration of war had been made, so it could not constitute a war between nations in a legal sense. Therefore, they refused to terminate the contract and would not refund the prepaid payments to Yuan An. Yuan An's manager, Zhao Yunsheng, hired lawyers Yang Linzhi, Zhang Jiajia, and Ye Shaoying to file a lawsuit with the First Special District Court against Chen Shuntong, the manager of Zhong Wei, seeking termination of the charter agreement and requesting a judgement ordering the defendant to return 14,150.81 yuan. At the trial, the plaintiff's lawyers, based on Chinese and foreign legal principles and the various brutal acts of the Japanese army during wartime, argued that even without a declaration of war, war had indeed been constituted. They presented all evidence to prove the payments made. The defendant hired lawyers Wei Wenhan and Lu Jianai to defend, stating that since September 18th of last year, although there had been continuous resistance in various places in China, it could not be considered war. This was evidenced by the declarations of China's diplomatic authorities and China's representatives to the League of Nations. Therefore, the plaintiff could not use the terms of the agreement as an excuse for termination. Moreover, when the January 28th Incident occurred, the "Taiping" steamship was in Tianjin, preparing to sail to Guangdong, which was far from the Shanghai conflict and did not pose an obstruction. Even regarding the Shanghai port, Chinese ships entered and exited daily during the intense fighting. Therefore, the plaintiff could not invoke Article 41 of the agreement as a basis for termination. Furthermore, the plaintiff's prepaid rent and other items according to the agreement could not be claimed for return under general legal principles. They requested that the original lawsuit be dismissed. Judge Yang delivered a judgement, recognizing that the incident had indeed constituted what is called war and that the plaintiff's request for termination was entirely justified. Therefore, the termination was granted. This judgement not only resolves the dispute in this case but also provides assistance for future negotiations with Japan. The reasons stated in the judgement are excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>The key points of the investigation in this case are (1) whether the plaintiff's termination complies with the terms agreed upon by both parties, and (2) whether the request for the return of prepaid freight and other items can be legally recognized as justified. Regarding the first point, the termination conditions in the original agreement are two: (A) war, and (B) the agreement being affected by the war. Based on this investigation, the so-called "war," according to the true intentions of the parties when signing the contract, does not specifically refer to a war automatically and universally waged by China against any country. Moreover, regarding the definition of war, it is when there is a dispute between one country or two or more countries, and the dispute includes various violent acts, then it has constituted what is called war. As for whether the general effects of war are present, it is not of great importance. Therefore, the plaintiff's argument for termination based on the January 28th Shanghai war is not inappropriate. Furthermore, according to the conditions stipulated in the original agreement that the agreement is affected by the war, one cannot argue that the condition for termination has not been fulfilled solely because Shanghai or other ports can still navigate during the Shanghai war, meaning the agreement has not been affected or obstructed. This is because the objective development of the war at that time could not be predicted by the parties, and the situation of coastal cargo transport is difficult to infer based on normal conditions. The plaintiff's agent stated that the Shanghai war had affected the agreement, which is difficult to consider unreasonable. Therefore, the plaintiff's request for termination is entirely justified. Regarding the second point, according to Article 77 of the Maritime Law, if the shipper terminates a voyage contract established for continuous navigation, the shipper should pay the full freight, and the freight already prepaid cannot be requested for return, which goes without saying. In this case, both parties entered into a time charter agreement for continuous navigation, in other words, a charter agreement for a predetermined period of transportation, which is fundamentally different from voyage transportation under Articles 75 and 76 of the Maritime Law. According to the above explanation, regarding the prepaid freight, the plaintiff can only deduct it based on Article 96 of the Maritime Law, three-quarters of the freight earned from other loaded cargo, and all expenses saved due to the termination. There is no possibility of requesting the remaining prepaid freight to be returned. If it were not so, when a ship is far from its home port and does not obtain sufficient cargo, the shipowner would inevitably suffer significant losses. However, the ship security deposit and fumigation fees, along with prepaid coal, totaling 3,800.81 yuan, are not within the scope of freight. Therefore, the defendant should return the full amount. Based on Article 82 of the Civil Procedure Law, the judgement is specially made as stated in the main text.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Assassination Case in Yangjiazhai, Pudong, Yesterday Afternoon <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>The Deceased Was "Sanbao" of the Wharf</p>
<p>In Charge of Insurance for Merchant Steamships</p>
<p>The Assailant Fired as Many as Five Shots</p>
<p>The Truth Behind the Attack Is Unclear</p>
<p>"Sanbao" (nickname) of the wharf, who was the head of insurance for various merchant steamships of the North and South Seas lines of the China Merchants Bureau, had considerable influence in the area from the Sixteenth Wharf to Xinkaihe. Unexpectedly, at noon yesterday, as he walked out of his home in Pudong and reached Tudi Tang Street, he was suddenly assassinated by an enemy with gunfire, shot twice and killed. The event caused a stir in the surrounding area, and onlookers crowded the scene. The details of the assassination obtained from the investigation are recorded below:</p>
<p>Assailant Pursued and Shot; The deceased, named Ye Sanbao, lived at No. 3, Lane 78, Yangjiazhai Road, Pudong. Yesterday, at 12:15 PM, after lunch at home, he put on a regular green woolen short overcoat and intended to go to Puxi. As he walked north on Yangjiazhai Road and turned west onto Tudi Tang Street, a slender man wearing a felt hat, who had been lying in wait there, saw Ye approaching and suddenly pulled out a pistol and fired three shots in a row, none of which hit him. However, one bullet entered the Xinchunji Barber Shop at that location, shattering a piece of glass, fortunately without injuring anyone. Ye, now in a state of panic, ran wildly and immediately took refuge in the Dongwanmao Oil Shop at No. 73 on that street. By this time, the enemy had already chased him to the shop entrance and fired two more shots at Ye, one bullet hitting the right breast and the other lodging in the right rib cage, neither of which penetrated. Ye, wounded, lost his footing and fell backwards outside the counter in the shop, head inside and feet outside, covered in blood. The assailant, seeing that his goal had been achieved, fled west, turning south into Lane 69 and disappearing. The family members, hearing the alarm, rushed to the scene, but Ye was already staring blankly with his mouth closed, though still barely breathing. He soon died of his injuries.</p>
<p>Police from the Third District Investigate; Upon learning of the incident, the Third District Police immediately dispatched officers to pursue the assailant, but he was nowhere to be found. Since there were too many onlookers at the scene of the incident, Inspector Liu Huansheng led police officers to maintain order. The Dongwanmao Oil Shop was also closed and temporarily ceased business. Subsequently, District Chief Zhang personally arrived at the scene to inspect and question nearby residents about the circumstances of the shooting. He then ordered that the body be temporarily left in place pending an autopsy, and instructed the local bailiff Xie Along to submit a request to the local court for an autopsy. It is said that due to timing issues, personnel will be dispatched across the river tomorrow morning for an autopsy, so Sanbao's body remains in place overnight.</p>
<p>Investigation of the Deceased's Background; It is learned that Ye was 35 years old, from northern Zhejiang. Seven or eight years ago, he became acquainted with a local widow named Ma, and they lived together at No. 3, Lane 78, Yangjiazhai Road, Pudong. Ma already had a son named Liudao, around 20 years old, who worked as a coppersmith in the XiangSheng Iron Factory. He was not yet married, so they lived together in the same household. After Ma became acquainted with Sanbao, she gave birth to another son named Fudao, who is now four years old. Ye is currently the head of insurance for the North and South Seas lines of merchant steamships Xinming, Xinfeng, Gongping, Yushun, Jiahe, and Tunan of the Jinliyuan Wharf under the China Merchants Bureau, employing many insurance agents. When each ship arrives at the port, they are responsible for protecting the goods being loaded and unloaded. If there is any theft, Ye is responsible, so his income is quite good.</p>
<p>Speculation on the Reasons for the Murder; Ye had considerable influence in the wharf area and was known as "Sanbao of the Wharf." Ye also bought the leftover, unusable paper scraps from the Nanyang Tobacco Factory and resold them to paper mills, making a considerable profit. Therefore, in recent years, his family has become quite wealthy, unlike the previous days when he was dissolute and unemployed. As for the reason for this sudden assassination, according to various speculations by onlookers, it may be that Ye had made enemies with people due to various matters, leading to this attack, or it may be related to a love triangle. Rumors are rampant, and it is impossible to determine the truth.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Two of the Nine Kidnapped Men and Women Escape Home <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Terrible Condition Upon Returning Home, Covered in Sacks</p>
<p>Hands and Feet Bound with Wire, Suffering Unspeakable Pain</p>
<p>Li Jisheng (nickname "Old Foreigner"), a villager from the coastal area about two li north of Chuansha in Baoshan County, became wealthy after rescuing a Westerner at sea. When Li Jisheng passed away, he left hundreds of acres of land in the western countryside. His eldest son, Li Fengming (known as "Little Foreigner"), and other men and women, a total of nine people, were kidnapped by bandits in September and held for a ransom of 300,000 yuan. Details of this were reported in this newspaper on September 27th. Now, it is learned that Liu and Wang, two of the five women among those kidnapped, suddenly escaped from the bandits' den yesterday and returned home safely. However, when the two women escaped, they were in a terrible condition, not only haggard but also completely without clothes, covered only in sacks. Their tragic state is difficult to describe. The cruelty of the bandits is shocking and appalling. According to Liu and others, after they were kidnapped, they were hidden in a dilapidated house in Dasha, across from Liuh River. The nine men and women were hidden in two separate places. Liu and the other four women were held in the same house. During the day, they were not given enough to eat and were often beaten, leaving them covered in injuries. They were forced to pay a ransom, but when they replied that they were imprisoned and had no money for a ransom, the bandits were unreasonable. At night, their clothes were stripped off, and their hands and feet were bound with wire, causing unspeakable pain. Fortunately, a bamboo craftsman nearby, who knew the bandit guard, took pity on our suffering and secretly hid a pair of scissors. That evening, taking advantage of the bandits' inattention, he cut the wires on our hands and feet. He went back first, and late at night, the two of us escaped first, and the other three women followed. Before long, the bandits discovered our escape and searched in all directions. The bandits caught the three women behind us, but we two were fortunate enough to escape into the home of a villager, who kindly allowed us to stay until dawn and gave us clothes to wear before we were able to escape home. As she spoke, tears streamed down her face, undoubtedly due to the suffering she experienced in the bandits' den.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Four King Kongs, Notorious Robbers of Freight Trains <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Three of Them Arrested by Railway Police</p>
<p>Already Sent to the Garrison Headquarters</p>
<p>Due to two incidents of freight train robbery occurring on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway in Huangdu and Zhenru, Jian Huanluan, the police chief of Maigen Road, has assumed heavy responsibility for the implementation of freight train transportation and is diligently investigating the matter. It is now learned that the leaders of the notorious freight train robbers, Wang Dahanzi (also known as Wu Licai), Li Baoshun (also known as Li Mapi, wanted by the patrol station), Jia Laosi, and Xu Xiaobianzi, possess extraordinary skills and can jump onto moving trains at high speed to steal goods, earning them the nickname "Four King Kongs." They initially committed robberies on trains in the north and have been rampant for years, with hundreds of accomplices. The Shanghai-Nanjing Railway has repeatedly suffered from organized freight train robberies, but none have been solved. Recently, such as the robbery of four freight trains on August 25th in the Huangdu area and the robbery of train No. 465 near Zhenru on September 28th, where they fired shots as a warning, were all committed by these four notorious robbers. The Railway Bureau, which is currently responsible for transportation, urgently needs to eliminate them to maintain freight transport. It has issued orders to the police stations to conduct strict arrests. Currently, Jian Huanluan, the police chief of Maigen Road, has secretly offered a large reward and set up informants to investigate the whereabouts of the notorious robbers Wang Dahanzi and others, who are hiding near Zhenru. He has secretly dispatched investigators Li Bing, Yu Shousheng, police sergeant Zuo Liantang, and Li Demao, giving them instructions and disguising them to go separately to investigate. After confirming their location, they coordinated an ambush and arrested Wang Dahanzi and Yin Youcai on the spot. After interrogation, they confessed to repeatedly organizing freight train robberies. Subsequently, it was discovered that the notorious robber Li Baoshun (Li Mapi) had fled to Wuxi. Police chief Jian personally led police sergeant Li Demao to pursue and arrest him. The bandit initially resisted and attempted to escape, but police sergeant Li fired a shot to pursue him and finally arrested him and brought him back to Shanghai. Police commissioner Ma of the two road police stations personally questioned him. He confessed that he had repeatedly robbed freight trains on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway in collusion with Wang Dahanzi and Jia Laosi. Further interrogation revealed that Jia Laosi was currently hiding in the capital. Commissioner Ma, considering police chief Jian's expertise in investigation, again dispatched him and police sergeant Li Demao to the capital to obtain informants and confirm his location. They cooperated with the police department of the capital and arrested the robber Jia Laosi in Pukou and brought him back to Shanghai. Subsequently, the bandit confessed that in 1928, he was arrested for robbing a train in Kunshan and sentenced to four years in prison. He was released in June of this year, and in August, he colluded with Wang, Li, and others to rob a train. Some of his accomplices, Xu Fengshan and Shen Jinfu, were arrested by the Hongkou patrol station more than ten days ago. Commissioner Ma Shaoping and Deputy Commissioner Li Dingrong reviewed the case and determined that the bandits had been rampant on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway for years, openly robbing and committing numerous crimes, which were not comparable to ordinary cases. Strict punishment was necessary to maintain public order. They ordered police chief Jian to send the three bandits, Wang, Li, and Jia, to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters on the 26th of this month and requested military justice.</p>

<p>Taxpayers' Association Sends Letter to the Municipal Council</p>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession yesterday sent a letter to the Director-General of the Municipal Council, stating: "We are writing to you regarding a letter from the Shanghai Real Estate Association, which stated that the tenants of Longjili, a member of our association, reported that the British Shanghai Waterworks Company has stopped supplying water to the district since October 24th. Water is essential for people's livelihood and cannot be lacked for even a moment. If unfortunate events occur, the water company should be fully responsible. The association regrets that the water company has suddenly resorted to such coercive measures while we are jointly seeking a reasonable solution. In light of the aforementioned situation, which concerns the safety of taxpayers within the concession and the lack of protection, we request that your council promptly find a way to rectify this situation." In this regard, the fact in dispute is that the goal of calculating water fees by meter to control waste has not been achieved, and the burden on payers is truly unbearable. Our association sincerely hopes that a mutually acceptable solution can be reached to control waste without causing any loss to either party. We do not want to see the water company rely on its monopoly power to forcibly increase fees, which would cause your council to have regrets regarding the protection of the lives and safety of taxpayers. In light of the aforementioned situation, we request that your council first order the water company to turn on the water, pending a reasonable solution.</p>

<p>Planning to Extend the Long-Distance Ferry Line to Wusong</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Ferry began operating a special Shanghai-Wusong service in March of this year, it has also operated a ferry between Wusong and Gaoqiao to connect with the long-distance ferry from Shanghai to Gaoqiao. Later, the special Shanghai-Wusong service was suspended, and the operating hours of the ferry between Wusong and Gaoqiao were reorganized to allow travelers between Shanghai and Wusong to take the ferry every two hours. Meanwhile, the construction of the Wusong ferry terminal was planned to realize the plan of extending the long-distance ferry to Wusong. It is now learned that the Wusong terminal will be built soon. During the construction period, the Gaoqiao-Wusong ferry will have no suitable place to dock. Therefore, it has been decided that the service will be suspended from November 1st. Once the Wusong terminal is completed, the long-distance ferries will be extended to Wusong.</p>

<p>Director of the Labor Relief Bureau, Tang Zhenlong, Is Accused</p>
<p>Tang Zhenlong, a native of Hebei who is the Director of the Sixteenth District Labor Relief Bureau of the National Government's Flood Relief Committee and currently resides at No. 2 Xilin Lane, Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, contracted Zheng Zhiqing from Hebei as a contractor to hire seven or eight hundred workers to work on the dredging project in Jiangbei Yancheng and Funing counties during July of this year. A contract was established with a deadline for completion. Subsequently, due to the order to stop the project, he instructed Zheng to settle the payment after arriving in Shanghai. Zheng, fearing trouble due to the gathering and demanding of workers, asked Tang for money to dismiss the workers. Tang then detained Zheng and brought him to Shanghai, escorted by the Yancheng police along the way. After arriving in Shanghai by train via Zhenjiang, he sent people to guard him in the hotel and forced him to write a receipt to reduce his wages. Therefore, Zheng, dissatisfied, hired lawyer Zhu Dianqing to file a criminal self-indictment with the Second Special District Court, accusing Tang of coercion and obstructing freedom under Articles 316 and 318 of the Criminal Law, requesting investigation, and attached a civil suit to recover the owed 3,618.70 yuan (the indictment is omitted). The court, based on the indictment, summoned the plaintiff, accompanied by his lawyer, to the first criminal court presided over by Judge Li Changnian yesterday afternoon to state the circumstances of being detained by the defendant, escorted to Shanghai, and being guarded in the hotel after arriving in Shanghai. When questioned, the defendant Tang Zhenlong denied bringing the plaintiff to Shanghai and guarding him, stating that he had voluntarily accompanied him to Shanghai to settle accounts and that the wages owed had already been paid. He also presented witnesses Zhou Rongkui and others to testify, and hired lawyer Lan Xuzhang for defense. As a result, the court declared the debate closed and scheduled a date for the verdict.</p>

<h3 id="e149">Cash Shop Accountant's Investment Failure <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Embezzles Approximately 20,000 Yuan in Cash Shop Funds</p>
<p>Self-Surrender and Amnesty Reduce Sentence</p>
<p>Ma Boqing, a native of Zhenjiang, has been working as an accountant at the Hetai Cash Shop at No. 299 Sichuan Road for more than 20 years. Recently, due to trading in public bonds, he incurred significant losses, leading to the embezzlement of 21,000 yuan in cash shop funds. Manager Wu Ziqing reported the matter to the General Police Station, which ordered detectives to arrest Ma on the previous day. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Li Zhishan, a lawyer from the Police Station, stated that the Police Station is currently prosecuting him for embezzlement under Article 357, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. However, the accounts have not yet been verified, so he requested a postponement. Hetai Cash Shop hired lawyer Wei Wenhan to appear in court and filed a civil suit to order the defendant to repay 18,880 yuan in silver and 1,500 taels of silver. When questioned, Ma Boqing confessed to the embezzlement and stated that the money was borrowed from friends, used to compensate for security deposits, or lost in public bond trading since 1922. However, he stated that he had surrendered himself to the manager and asked for leniency. Feng Shide, the presiding judge of the Criminal Court, stated that the facts of the case were already very clear and that there was no need to postpone the trial. He ordered the debate to begin. Li, the lawyer from the Police Station, stated that the defendant's criminal acts all occurred before the promulgation of the amnesty decree and that he should receive a one-third reduction in his sentence. Since he also surrendered himself, he should be further reduced by one-third of his original sentence according to law, and requested a ruling. Judge Feng then announced the verdict in court, sentencing Ma Boqing to five months of imprisonment for continuous embezzlement of money held in his professional capacity and ordering him to repay Hetai 18,888 yuan in silver and 1,500 taels of silver.</p>

<p>No Conclusive Evidence Found</p>
<p>Regarding the tragic case at No. 263, Changyuan Lane, Haining Road, a pavilion house inhabited by Liang Xiuzhen and Li Huiqing, both Cantonese dancing girls from Anlegong, where on the morning of the 19th of this month, at approximately 2 a.m., intruders broke in and fatally injured four individuals with sharp weapons: Liang Xiuzhen's mother, Madam Liang Li, her disciple Lun, her younger sister Qiaolan, and Li's adopted son Dong Liguang. Subsequently, Wang Jigen (also known as Yiying), a 21-year-old from Shaoxing, residing at No. 20, Dekang Lane, Fusheng Road, in the Chinese-administered area of North Sichuan Road, surrendered himself to the Hongkou Police Station, who handed him over to the First Special District Court. The police requested temporary detention for further investigation, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Shen Bingrong continued the hearing in the Third Criminal Court. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, stated that during the adjournment, the investigation revealed no conclusive evidence against the defendant. It was discovered that fingerprints were left in the pavilion house at the time of the incident. The Western officer in the police fingerprint department photographed and enlarged these prints, then compared them with the defendant's fingerprints, finding them completely different. Furthermore, before the victimized boy, Liang Zilun, died in the hospital, the defendant was brought in and asked to identify him as the assailant. Although the boy could not speak, he shook his head and, when asked if he was definitely not the murderer, he nodded in affirmation.  It was also reported that four ten-dollar Hong Kong bank notes, twenty-six silver dollars, gold rings, gold bracelets, and inlaid bracelets were lost from the scene. Detectives searched his home but found nothing. The defendant had been discussing joining the Northeast Volunteer Army's rescue team with his friends Zhang Guozhen and Wan Chengliang since the 15th of this month at Room 43 of the Dahulu Inn, No. 85, Baili Bridge Street, in the French Concession. Police detectives investigated and confirmed this to be true. Waiters stated that he was staying at the inn and did not leave at 2 a.m. on the 19th. Therefore, the police decided not to prosecute the defendant and requested his release. Moreover, Liang Xiuzhen and Li Huiqing also gave statements, claiming that the defendant had no previous animosity with Madam Liang Li and could not identify him as the perpetrator. Judge Shen ruled that the defendant Wang Jigen, also known as Wang Yiying, should be released.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Two Guilds of Cured Meat and Ham Businesses to Petition Party and Government Authorities Today <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Requesting Complete Cancellation of Inspection Measures</p>
<p>Stating Four Reasons: No Inferior Products</p>
<p>The two guilds of cured meat and ham businesses in this city have scheduled to dispatch sixteen representatives to the city's Party headquarters, the municipal government, and the municipal chamber of commerce this morning to petition for the cancellation of inspection issues. The recorded petition is as follows: A petition for the cancellation of the city's inspection of cured meats and hams, hoping for fair consideration.  We, the guilds, received a joint official letter from the city's Health and Finance Bureaus in July of this year, relayed by the municipal chamber of commerce, stating that hams and cured meats were planned for import inspection, and that a fee of half a dollar per hundred catties would be charged for inspection. Subsequently, the guilds repeatedly sent representatives to negotiate with the municipal chamber of commerce, stating that if this inspection fee was collected, the industry would find it difficult to agree. After the cured meat industry first submitted a written statement of opposition, the municipal chamber of commerce then forwarded a reply from the Finance and Health Bureaus. Whether ham and cured meat are detrimental to health and whether inspection is necessary are matters that the industry urgently wants to clarify, sparing no effort. We now respectfully present the factual situation of the industry as follows: (1) Ham and cured meat are invariably made during the winter season when the weather is cold, so where do diseased animal meats come from? Therefore, in Chinese custom, when people are ill, they avoid eating various vegetables, but ham and cured meat can be used as a condiment. This is because ham and cured meat have undergone legitimate production supervision and are not harmful to health, thus eliminating the need for inspection. (2) Merchants invest in business to seek profit, and can diseased animal meat be made into cured meat? Anyone with a clear understanding of the matter will surely say no. As for the careful selection during the production of ham, it goes without saying. Although diseased animal meat is difficult to avoid for livestock farmers, cured meat and ham businesses invest in meat, produce products, and even the most foolish people would not buy inferior meat and manufacture inferior products, thus ruining their capital. Therefore, in theory, there is no possibility of unhealthy, inferior meat being mixed into ham and cured meat, thus eliminating the need for inspection. (3) Our country has been established for over five thousand years. Although there is no definite historical record of the method of making ham and cured meat, in the areas of Jinhua, where it is produced, people slaughter fat pigs during the winter to make ham and cured meat for future needs. Because of its delicious taste and long shelf life, it was gradually sold to other areas. Later, there were many who enjoyed eating it, and areas north of the Yangtze River, such as Gaoyou and Taixing, also became production areas for ham and cured meat. Shandong's La pigs also followed suit. Looking at the current merchants in the Jiangbei area who produce ham, most of them are from Jinhua, which shows that ham and cured meat are the most economical food for the people.  There are no reports of people dying from poisoning from eating ham and cured meat, let alone diseased animal meat being mixed in, thus eliminating the need for inspection. (4) According to the reply from the city's Finance and Health Bureaus, the inspection is being carried out to protect the health of the two million meat-eating people in Shanghai. If this inspection is truly as stated, then the production areas of ham and cured meat, such as Jinhua, Jiangbei, and Shandong, are all part of our country's territory. Why not issue a unified order to carry out pre- and post-slaughter inspections? Now, if only the market where it is sold is inspected, it is putting the cart before the horse, which is not only not beneficial in fact, but also unfair in principle, thus eliminating the need for inspection. Based on the above four reasons, we are only addressing the most salient points. Commercial difficulties, economic hardship, and overlapping taxes have made it difficult for merchants and the people to bear. Moreover, since the Japanese invaded Shanghai and the war broke out, the market has been extremely depressed, making it unbearable to add harsh policies and burden the people. Considering the past and looking to the future, the guilds are heartbroken and witness this situation. Therefore, we have no choice but to send representatives Yang Chenhu, Wang Tingsheng, Cai Xiaozhi, Zhang Dongyun, Xue Chunrong, Kong Guangyuan, Qian Yibiao, Chen Rongsheng, Wang Mingdeng, Lu Degao, Dai Songfu, Pan Jinluo, Xu Yinshu, Zhang Ji'an, Cao Yongzhang, Xi Danru, and sixteen others to petition, earnestly requesting that the authorities (chamber of commerce) review and approve the cancellation of the ham and cured meat inspection measures by the Health and Finance Bureaus in order to alleviate the hardships of merchants, which would be a public service.

<p>Settled in a Reconciliation Record Signed at the Social Bureau</p>
<p>The alcohol workshops in Pudong, including Xinji and Wanyuan in Hujia Muqiao, and Fuji in Lujiadu, had a labor dispute caused by the employers dismissing a large number of workers without reason. The dispute has been going on for a long time and has not been resolved. Yesterday afternoon at 2 p.m., a formal mediation was held again at the Social Bureau. Those present included Tan Peiyan, the mediator from the Social Bureau, Li Weixiong, the representative from the City Party Headquarters, Wang Bingkui and Lin Xiaofang, the representatives from the labor union, Fang Zhongheng and Zhu Qingtang, the representatives from the employer's association. Chairman Tan Peiyan started by having the labor representative report on the dispute's history, followed by debate. Finally, with the chairman's repeated guidance to both sides, a settlement was reached. Then both parties signed a reconciliation record, the contents of which are as follows: (1) The industry association will persuade Xinji workers Lin Xiaofang and Tang Zhixian, Fuji worker Shen Guomin, and Wanyuan worker Yu Shuiqiao to continue to be employed by the alcohol workshops. (2) Xinji workers Lin Zhilin and Shen A'er, and Fuji worker Chen Yaohan, who are in Shanghai, will each be given 15 yuan for travel expenses to return home. Workers not in Shanghai are not included in this clause.</p>

<p>Heavier Measures Added to Scales</p>
<p>The Municipal Government and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and Rice Industry Association yesterday received a telegram from the Jiashan County Rice Industry Association stating that Shanghai husi (rice shops) often use heavier measures and add weight to the scales, with rice buyers losing three liters per shi (unit of dry measure) in undisclosed wastage. The rice shops do not stop this practice, leading to repeated disputes. The Jiashan County Rice Industry Association urges that fair restraint be ordered to show impartiality, and that rice boat owners be advised to continue business as usual to avoid huge losses. Considering the people's food supply, the association urgently sends a telegram to plead for action. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has forwarded the letter to the rice industry organization for verification and handling.</p>

<p>Wang Jiazhen Surrendered to Await Interrogation</p>
<p>Postponed Due to Cai Huaxian's Absence</p>
<p>The two concubines of the late Army 10th Division Commander Yang Shengzhi, Wang Jiazhen and Cai Huaxian, are involved in a lawsuit in the First Special District Court over the 120,000 yuan deposited in the Bank of China and the Central South Bank during Commander Yang's lifetime. Wang had requested that the funds be seized first, but Cai colluded with Sun Luan, the manager of the China Industrial Bank, to withdraw the funds in advance, rendering the court's seizure order ineffective. Wang Jiazhen then filed a criminal self-accusation against Cai Huaxian, Sun Luan, and Yang Xiuqian, Cai's son, accusing them of conspiring to conceal assets and obstructing enforcement, requesting a swift investigation. This has already been reported in the newspapers. Yesterday afternoon at 2:30 p.m., the case was scheduled for public hearing. Wang Jiazhen, accompanied by her lawyer, reported to the Fourth Court of the First Special District Court as scheduled. The woman was young, fair-skinned, slender, fashionable, with a bobbed haircut, leather shoes, wearing a black lined cheongsam, and a beige vest, standing tall and elegant, further enhancing her beauty. However, none of the three defendants appeared, only their lawyer. The lawyer stated that the defendants Cai Huaxian and Yang Xiuqian, mother and son, both lived in Nanjing and were unable to surrender themselves today, requesting a postponement. However, according to the plaintiff's lawyer, Cai and her son were actually in Shanghai, and Sun Luan was also believed to be in Shanghai. If Sun had been transferred to Tianjin by the bank, the Tianjin court should be consulted for assistance. However, the plaintiff also heard that the defendant Cai Huaxian was eager to withdraw the deposit and transport Commander Yang's coffin back to her ancestral home in Guizhou. If further delays allowed the defendant to realize this plan, the plaintiff would be further affected. The defendant's lawyer stated that the defendants resided in Nanjing, and Yang Xiuqian was only twelve years old. Judge Huang stated that as the defendants had not appeared, it was difficult to proceed with the trial, and instructed the defendant's lawyer to notify the defendants to come to Shanghai as soon as possible to await scheduling for interrogation. The lawyer complied, and the court adjourned.</p>

<p>Petitioned the Municipal Government Yesterday</p>
<p>Since the withdrawal of Japanese troops from Zhabei, the market conditions are no longer as prosperous as before. The tenants of Yongxiang Lane on Datong Road claim that the rents set in the lane, 28 yuan per month for each two-story shikumen house in the lane, and 40-50 yuan per room in the market building, are much higher than those in nearby lanes. Furthermore, during the Municipal Government's restoration of Zhabei, such high rents should not be imposed. In order to alleviate the unbearable burden, the tenants of the lane requested the landlord, Shunxiang Real Estate Company, to voluntarily reduce the rent. Due to the landlord's strong attitude, they petitioned the Party and government authorities for relief. Yesterday, they publicly elected representatives Xie Baoxing and more than ten others to petition the municipal government, which received them. It was said that the petition has been submitted to the Rent Dispute Committee for deliberation, and a fair resolution is expected soon.</p>

<h3 id="e160">Bandits From Changzhou Approved for Transfer <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>On August 22nd of this year, several bandits suddenly came to the home of Song Liu, a resident of Dong Tangjia Village, Jinniu Township, Wujin County, Changzhou, and abducted her two-year-old son Fang Rong. Afterwards, they sent a letter to Song, demanding a ransom of 3,000 yuan. Song reported the matter to the local authorities, requesting an investigation. Later, Song received repeated letters from the bandits, and the ransom was reduced from 3,000 yuan to 1,500 yuan, ordering them to contact them at the Qunle Tea House at No. 704 Maigen Road in Shanghai. Song Liu then sent Wang Baocheng as a representative to Shanghai. After meeting the bandit Zhang Zilong (also known as Hongsheng), they negotiated a ransom of 300 yuan and agreed to hand over the money at 5 p.m. the day before yesterday. Wang reported this to Song Liu, who reported it to the Wujin County Public Security Bureau. Detective Ni Gusheng and Wu Hanwen, the Wujin resident detective in Shanghai, came to Shanghai by car the day before yesterday. After reporting to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, they met with Liu Chunshu, the Chinese detective of the Gordon Road Police Station, and secretly went to the Qunle Tea House to wait. At around 5 p.m., Zhang and his accomplice Shen Jinfu (also known as Ma Zi Ne Gen) arrived. The detectives immediately arrested Zhang and Shen and took them into custody at the police station. Yesterday morning, Gao Wansheng, a detective from the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, surrendered to the First Special District Court, requesting approval for transfer in order to bring the case to justice. The victim Song Liu also testified: I am a resident of Changzhou, 30 years old. On July 21st, Zhang Hongsheng and others came to my home and took my son Fang Rong, then sent me a letter demanding a ransom. Therefore, I sent Wang Baocheng to Shanghai to negotiate. I don't know anything else. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated that the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau requested the transfer of the case, and the police did not object. However, since they did not bring official documents today, they should be ordered to submit them, and the defendants should be taken away first. After Judge Ge Ci questioned Zhang and Shen, he approved their handover to Gao Wansheng, an officer from the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, to be taken away and brought to justice.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Robbery at Xiangyan Bridge in Zhabei <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>At 7 p.m. last night, eight bandits suddenly came to the home of Huang Yunzhi at No. 6 Henglu Road, Xiangyan Bridge, Zhabei. All were wearing blue cloth shirts and pants, spoke with a Jiangbei accent, and only two bandits carried guns. They first intimidated the family members to silence them, then searched everyone's pockets and drawers. They robbed them of 38 yuan in silver dollars, 4 yuan in paper money, and 8 jiao in small coins, and fled westward. Afterwards, the victim urgently reported to the Third Precinct of the Fifth District, but the bandits had already fled far away. The police were immediately dispatched to pursue them.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Electricity Restoration Imminent in Wusong <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>The Baoming Electric Plant in Wusong suffered losses due to the war and was unable to resume operations. After a resolution by the shareholders of the plant, it was merged into the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company. However, due to unsettled terms, the merger has been delayed until now, causing the restoration of light in the entire town of Wusong to be indefinite. The municipal public security authorities have also repeatedly requested the municipal government to order the plant to resume operations as soon as possible. It is now learned that the plant has reached an agreement with the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company to formally merge, and the Yongdian Company has appointed Shen Kuibai as the director of the Wusong office (the former Baoming plant site). Yesterday, a large number of workers were hired to rush the work of erecting poles and laying lines throughout the town. When the reporter met with Director Shen and inquired about the date of power restoration, he said that electricity could be generated and light restored after the lines throughout the town of Wusong were completed. As for Paotaiwan and Baoshan, it is also planned to gradually restore them after the preliminary work is completed.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning, the First Special District Court opened a trial for cases of violating the Stamp Tax Regulations. Twelve defendants, except for Taikang Western Clothing Store, whose address did not match and could not be summoned, the other eleven were summoned to court for failing to affix stamps to invoices and receipts. After a brief interrogation by Judge Shen Shanzeng, they all confessed to the omission. The court then sentenced Yongdaxiang Sesame Oil Shop to a fine of 140 yuan, Hengtai Rice Shop to a fine of 90 yuan, Shenzhou Hotel to a fine of 40 yuan, Lao Yan Maoyuan Shaoxing Liquor Shop to a fine of 20 yuan, and Shengchang Yellow Sand Shop, Yuantai Iron Shop, Chengyuanji Soda Shop, China Chemical Industry, Dafu Southern Goods Shop, Dajiali Western Restaurant, and Sanxing Water and Electricity Company to fines of 12 yuan each. Furthermore, the account books of Yuanxiang Silk and Cloth Shop in Qujiang Lane, Sanma Road, had not been affixed with stamps. After being reported, the Shanghai Special Zone Stamp Tax Office sent personnel, together with judicial police and Chinese and Western detectives from the police station, carrying court search warrants, to the shop and seized twenty-two account books that had not been affixed with stamps or had insufficient stamps. These were handed over to the police station for handling. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Court also opened a joint trial. Judge Xu imposed a fine of 10 to 100 yuan per item for not affixing stamps according to the Stamp Tax Regulations, and sentenced the shop to a fine of 280 yuan. The account books were returned to the shop in court.</p>

<p>Quan Suo'er, a Tongzhou native residing in the Linjiazhai area of Yangjing, Pudong, was very poor and worked as a dockworker. He married a woman named Zhang, who was 18 years old. She was usually able to work and help out, but due to the high cost of living, any illness would lead to starvation. Recently, Zhang fell ill and was unable to work, which made her feel that life was meaningless. She hanged herself in bed. Her husband returned home and was unable to save her. He reported the incident to the Second Precinct of the Third District, and the local bailiff reported it to the local court for investigation.</p>
<p>The Changhe, a steamer owned by Jardine Matheson, was docked in front of the Xiang Sheng Factory wharf in Pudong. A 17-year-old tea boy named Yu Hongfa, who worked in the crew, went out on the side of the ship at midnight for some reason. He accidentally fell into the river in Pudong. An immediate rescue was launched, and he was recovered at 1:30 AM, but he had already drowned and could not be revived. The incident was reported to the Water Police Station, and detective Shen Changshan was ordered to take the body to the Salvation Bureau to report to the local court for investigation.</p>
<p>Zhou Qiaoyuan's six-year-old son, Zhou Xiyuan, from Jiading, was playing in front of his door on the west side of Zhongxing Road and Gonghexin Road yesterday morning when he was hit by a speeding truck, which crushed his head and killed him instantly. The truck then fled. Zhou Qiaoyuan reported the incident to the First Precinct of the Fifth District.

<p>1. Number of Standing Committees</p>
<p>32. The number of Standing Committees should be limited. I believe that there should be no more than five or six. All work supervising the various departments of the Municipal Council should be undertaken separately by these five or six Standing Committees. If the various committees meet on a regular basis, then the proposed number limitation is truly appropriate. If there is no limitation, then the amount of time spent by the directors to attend various committee meetings will inevitably be excessive. I know that there are currently ten committees, including the Education Committee, the Library Committee, and the Band Committee. These two committees are different from the other committees because the number of events submitted for review and handling is limited, and the number of members is also small. They can be called special committees to distinguish them from standing committees. The number of times the two committees meet probably does not need to be as frequent as the proposed standing committee meeting times. I believe that the work of the various committees can be redistributed, and five or at most six standing committees, including the Education Committee, can be used to replace the remaining eight committees, without hindering the duties of the Municipal Council.</p>
<p>2. Scope of Authority of the Committees</p>
<p>33. The authority of the Standing Committees should be defined in such a way that the authority and responsibilities of each committee have clear limits, and that there is a clear distinction between the executive and advisory tasks of the committees. This means that the committees may handle certain matters in accordance with their authority, while for other matters, they must submit their recommendations to the Board of Directors for consideration. I have now included in the appendix certain documents regarding the committee system implemented in Johannesburg (Note 15). This document is sufficient to explain some of the suggestions made regarding committees and provide examples, including the style of the articles of association used by all standing committees of the Johannesburg City Council. According to the provisions of this article of association, the Standing Committees have the right to manage specific departments separately. The appointment and removal of all other staff members other than the heads of the departments is considered by the responsible Standing Committee and a report is prepared. The appointment and removal of the heads of the departments is left to the General Affairs Committee. The Selection Committee of the Public Concession Municipal Council, as defined by its scope of authority, (examines general issues regarding the salaries and service regulations of staff members). According to the established practice in the bureau, the issue of the appointment of personnel in various departments should first be submitted to the Selection Committee for consideration. I assume that the original purpose of adopting this method was mostly to unify the service conditions of the various departments of the Municipal Council. Now that a clear grading system has been adopted as a result of the establishment of the Salary Committee, encompassing all positions in the Municipal Council, the current organization of the Selection Committee may no longer be necessary. I believe that the appointment and promotion of staff members in each department should be the responsibility of the Standing Committee that has a special relationship with that department, and that the recommendations should be made to the Board of Directors, or that they should be promoted separately in accordance with the powers granted by the Board of Directors. For example, the appointment and removal of staff members of the Works Department is the responsibility of the Works Committee, the appointment and removal of staff members of the Health Department is the responsibility of the Health Committee, and so on.</p>
<p>Regarding the powers and responsibilities of the Finance Committee, I intend to present them in another chapter, so I will not discuss the various issues that have a special relationship with that committee here.</p>
<p>3. Meetings of the Standing Committees</p>
<p>34. Meetings of the Standing Committees should be held every few days, within the range of possibility. That is, except in any necessary exceptional circumstances, a regular meeting should be held once every two weeks between two consecutive regular meetings of the Board of Directors, so that a report from each committee can be submitted for consideration each time a regular meeting of the Board of Directors is held.</p>
<p>35. The more frequent the committee meetings and the more executive power the Standing Committees are subject to, the more the opportunity to use the method of circulating documents for discussion can be greatly limited. A certain clause in the rules of the Board of Directors stipulates that any event that is circulated in a document but does not receive unanimous approval should be listed on the agenda of the next meeting. In addition to the fact that the directors must study the circulated documents and other items as part of their responsibilities, and that it may be inconvenient to circulate them due to busy schedules, this system is still objectionable. There is no opportunity for discussion when consulting by circulating documents, and if the event being consulted is submitted to a meeting of the Board of Directors or a meeting of the committee, one or two directors may raise some questions or arguments, but because this business has been approved by other directors, or because they are unwilling to ask to postpone the discussion and wait for a later discussion, this matter is delayed in decision.</p>
<p>4. Reports of the Committees</p>
<p>36. The minutes of the committee meetings and the committee reports submitted to the Board of Directors should be different. If a committee report system is adopted, the contents of the committee meeting minutes can be shortened, so that they include no more than the written reports of the bureau members obtained by the committee and the resolutions of the committee. The preparation of the committee report (Note 16) should enable the Board of Directors to clearly understand the various major events raised at the committee meeting. The various parts of each event should be marked with sequential numbers to facilitate reference. Some parts of the report only need to be presented to the Board of Directors, such as reports on the progress and statistics of the work of the departments in charge of the committee, and the committee's resolutions on matters that can be finally disposed of in accordance with its authority. However, for all matters that need to be decided by the Board of Directors, the report should clearly state all relevant facts, summarize the various arguments that have been considered by the committee and the reasons on which its conclusions are based, and make a recommendation to the Board of Directors to indicate how to proceed. This report, although signed by the chairman of the committee or another member who served as chairman at the meeting, should usually be drafted by the secretary of the committee under the supervision of the chief administrator of the Municipal Council. Most of this report should be based on the reports submitted to the committee by the heads of the relevant departments. The reports of the department heads can often be quoted verbatim, but it must also indicate all the major debates that took place during the committee's meeting, or the arguments that were raised, which are usually included in the committee's meeting minutes according to current practice. The benefits of submitting the committee's affairs to the Board of Directors in the form of a report are far greater than presenting them in the form of meeting minutes, because the content of the report can be arranged in such a way that all the issues are clearly expressed, and the various arguments are narrated according to their natural order. As for the meeting minutes, they are fundamentally only a record of the discussion process, and all the arguments in them are often presented in a mixed-up manner.</p>
<p>5. Procedure for Reviewing Committee Reports at Board of Directors Meetings</p>
<p>37. The following procedure (Note 17) should be adopted at Board of Directors meetings to dispose of the committee's reports, that is, the report is submitted by the chairman of the committee, but a copy should be sent to each director before the meeting. If each director can have a copy of this report before disposing of the committee's report at the Board of Directors meeting, it will be much easier to dispose of it. When the chairman of the committee submits the report, he should move that the Board of Directors accept the report. Although, generally speaking, this motion is purely a formality, if any director objects to a certain section of the report, and this statement does not include a recommendation, so it will not be naturally raised for consideration after the report has been accepted, the director can propose an amendment, that is, to accept the report, but excluding a certain part, the so-called certain part being the part that the director objects to. Once the motion (please accept the report) is passed, the recommendations in the report are submitted by the chairman in order and the ones that are adopted will be the resolutions of the Board of Directors. The chairman of the committee can make a statement to the Board of Directors on any recommendation in the report and ask for it to be passed, but even if the chairman does not do so, once the numbers of the report sections including each recommendation are submitted by the chairman or the chief administrator of the Municipal Council, it will be considered that the recommendation has been moved by the chairman for approval. However, if the chairman states in advance that he does not agree with the recommendation, then the recommendation should be moved for approval by other members of the committee. If so, the various recommendations can be debated one by one, just like an ordinary proposal, and an amendment can be proposed. This amendment mostly comes from the process of moving, ordering that the events recommended be resubmitted to the committee for consideration, and informing the committee of the points that the Board of Directors believes need to be reconsidered before a final decision is made.</p>
<p>38. Based on what I have observed, the procedure currently used by the Municipal Council Board of Directors to dispose of matters submitted by various committees is to accept in general terms everything discussed by the committee as recorded in the minutes of the previous committee meeting. The more important parts of the minutes are sometimes read out, and the major events are verbally explained by the chairman of the committee. The committee's resolutions are also explained by the chairman of the committee if they seem to need further explanation. However, each item recorded in the committee's meeting minutes is not submitted to the Board of Directors separately. If the directors have any questions about certain matters, they must wait until the chairman of the committee has finished explaining everything recorded in the minutes before they can raise them.</p>
<p>Submitting the various events recorded in the sections of the report that have been marked with numbers separately, referring to the chairman of the committee for further explanation when necessary, and debating them, and immediately deciding on the first event before the second event is submitted, I believe that this method can usually prove to be far more convenient than the current procedure, and the minds of the directors can be less laborious than at present, because according to the current procedure, after explaining the matters recorded in the latter part of the committee meeting minutes, it may be necessary to return to discuss the matters recorded in the previous part.

<h3 id="e177">Headlong Down a Dead End vs. (Seeking Another Path) <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Zeng Yu</p>
<p>(1) Foreign Aggression. More than a year has passed in the blink of an eye since the September 18th Incident last year. The enemy has been advancing steadily, starting with seizing our land, then organizing a puppet regime, and recognizing a puppet state. Looking back at our government and people, they have been running around and appealing. Today, they send a telegram to the League of Nations to maintain world peace, and tomorrow, they appeal to the great powers to uphold the Nine-Power Treaty. The enemy has seized our customs duties, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issues a protest. The enemy then attacks Rehe, and the government issues a telegram. But no matter how many times the protests are issued, and no matter how many telegrams are sent every day, what has been their effect over the past year? Everyone knows that it is equal to zero.</p>
<p>(2) Internal Warfare. At this time of such severe national crisis, the domestic warlords are staging their best performances. In the past, there were the two Chens in Guangdong, and now there are Han and Liu in Shandong, and the two Lius in Sichuan. Due to the frequent occurrence of internal warfare, a civil organization called the Anti-War Grand Alliance has emerged, and they send telegrams to these warlords (The national crisis is urgent, hoping for unified unity), (Another telegram is issued), (Those who are willing to be the first to use force will be abandoned by the people). But regardless of your national crisis or your being abandoned by the people, their good shows are being performed with great vigor, so the more telegrams are sent, the more vigorously they perform. In the end, its effect is also equal to zero.</p>
<p>Using the above two events as proof, it can be known that Chinese people are doing things in a way that is always (heading down a dead end). But the facts have already told you that (heading down a dead end) is useless and will not solve all your difficulties. So now there are many people loudly calling for (seeking another path). Speaking of (seeking another path), this may not be a good way to remedy the situation, but whether this other (path) can be found, and what its effect will be after it is found, is another question. Some people say that because (another path) cannot be found, it can only be (heading down a dead end). Because it can only be (heading down a dead end), there is no hope of resolving China's (foreign aggression) and (internal warfare) forever. When I heard this sentence, I felt that it made sense, but after thinking carefully, I want to ask China, which is organized by such a large population of 400 million people!</p>
<p>Is it really impossible to find another path?</p>
<p>Is it really going to be like this forever (heading down a dead end)?</p>

<p>Territory has always been stipulated by treaties,</p>
<p>Yet someone recklessly added soldiers without reason.</p>
<p>Now, all that's won is a pile of useless documents,</p>
<p>Given to whom to hold and express discontent?</p>
<p>The League of Nations' plans were poor in saving peace,</p>
<p>Pretending to investigate and wait for evaluation.</p>
<p>Clearly, it's a page of heartbreaking history,</p>
<p>Again provoking others to clamor for joint administration.</p>
<p>Empty promises are entrusted to the elite,</p>
<p>Self-determination alone can create a self-saving force.</p>
<p>Today, debts of gratitude and enmity can still be settled,</p>

<h3 id="e179">A Simple Method for Making Furs <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Tianlong</p>
<p>Indeed, we are powerless to process furs such as gray squirrel and fox fur, and can only sigh with envy. However, we can process ordinary sheep, dog, cat, rat, and yellow weasel furs anytime, anywhere, and their cost is very low, so why not do it? Now, I will write down the simple method below:</p>
<p>First, soak the raw or dry fur with hair in water (use cold water mixed with 0.1% caustic soda and carbolic acid) to restore it to its original state. Then, place it on a sloping wooden board and use a pure knife to scrape off the unnecessary parts on the flesh side (the knife edge should be perpendicular to the flesh side when scraping, and the thickness should be even). Then, use an iron comb to remove the old hair from the fur side. Then, apply red clay on the flesh side and expose it to the sun to allow the fat in the fur to be completely absorbed into the red clay. Then, use a wooden stick to knock off the clay and wash it clean with water. Then, you can start the tanning process. The tanning of fur is very simple. Just throw the fur, which has been prepared as described above, into various suitable tanning liquors (note) for immersion. The ordinary immersion time is about one or two days, but it must be fully stirred and reversed several times. After the tanning liquor is completely absorbed, it can be taken out to dry and embellished to become a bright and soft fur.</p>
<p>(Note) There are many types of fur tanning liquors, which can be roughly divided into: (1) using leather alum, salt, and rice flour; (2) using alum and salt; (3) using salt and oils; (4) using chrome salts; (5) using tannin or Fornaine. There are also those who mix several solutions for tanning. In short, it depends on the type of original fur. For skins like sheep, cats, and yellow weasels mentioned above, it is sufficient to use the first method of leather alum, salt, and rice flour, or the second method of alum and salt.</p>

<h3 id="e180">Discussion on the Issue of Preserving or Abolishing Ancestral Halls <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Wenbing</p>
<p>This column previously published an article by Mr. Wang Shibeng (Discussion on Improving the Management of Ancestral Halls). The author's intention is to improve the management of ancestral halls, which naturally acknowledges that they have a need to exist. This is originally each person's opinion and proposition. I only wish to offer my other opinion for public reference.</p>
<p>I do not agree with the management improvement of ancestral halls, and especially do not agree with the existence of ancestral halls. My major premise is: fundamentally abolish them. The reasons are as follows.</p>
<p>In terms of today's era trend, the existence of feudal remnants is no longer allowed, but it is ubiquitous in Chinese society. The ancestral hall of the clan is one of the most powerful forms of feudalism. In addition to the concept of home, Chinese people also have the clan. Therefore, the clan organization is the most sound, and the authority is also very large. The clan head of each clan can simply be said to be a local emperor. There are certainly good local emperors, but there are always more bad ones. In society, they often use the power of the clan to act arbitrarily and influence all matters, large and small. For example, if two families, A and B, are involved in a lawsuit, and family A is originally in the wrong, the clan head and others often forcibly seize the upper hand in order to maintain the reputation of their clan. Therefore, they do not hesitate to pawn ancestral property and bribe and collude with the government at all costs, making a very ordinary trivial matter unable to rest, wasting much energy and money, and also causing the emotions of both parties to deteriorate, regarding each other as enemies. Fights between clans often occur in various parts of Guangdong, often resulting in numerous casualties and generations of feuds. In the eyes of ordinary people, they still think it is to bring honor to the clan, and it is glorious even in death. Clan public funds are always encroached upon and swallowed by a few powerful people over time, or they are used as an excuse for sacrifices to hold grand banquets, eat and drink heavily, wasting social resources. In the past, if someone in the clan passed the imperial examinations, they would definitely hang some plaques. Now, graduates of schools also still play this trick. The most is that</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>when descendants work as officials outside, scraping the fat off the people, they return to their clan in glory, repair the ancestral hall, and hang plaques. In addition, if the clan head has a long life, there are even more tricks, such as hanging plaques and putting on operas. In short, with the existence of ancestral halls, we only see them heading towards vanity and consumption everywhere, and there is no benefit to speak of.</p>
<p>They are indifferent to the major national affairs outside the clan. For example, I have never heard of any clan generously donating to the Northeast Volunteer Army, and I have also never heard of any giant clan donating how much to the ancient water disaster last year. When encountering national affairs, they hold on to the principle of (each person sweeps the snow in front of their own door) and clutch their money bags, unwilling to let go.</p>
<p>Based on the above, it is sufficient to abolish ancestral halls. Moreover, today's society simply does not allow the existence of such feudal organizations. In today's harsh environment where we are pressed by strong neighbors, we should originally only have national concepts and the concept of all mankind. Undoubtedly, this narrow family concept and family organization should be abolished.</p>
<p>What to do after abolishing them? I can also offer some suggestions:</p>
<p>The buildings of ancestral halls occupy a large area. If they are used as factories or schools, they are all good places. Or they can be used as orphanages, civilian residences, or public hospitals. It all depends on the local social environment. If they are near cities, it is of course appropriate to run factories, orphanages, and hospitals. If they are in rural areas, it is better to use them as small school buildings or public libraries.</p>
<p>All public properties should also be used to run the above-mentioned undertakings, and absolutely no one or two powerful clan heads should be allowed to swallow them privately. However, this method will be difficult to achieve if it is only promoted verbally. The government must issue an order to force implementation. Then, those with rigid minds will naturally have to (hold their right heads in their mouths and worship the sky) and there will be no possibility of opposition.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to say: today's Chinese society is truly extremely unprogressive. We only see conservatism everywhere, and only see bad conservatism. We are unwilling to earnestly innovate, so the society and the country are not only unable to catch up with the world trend, but are also becoming increasingly backward. We urgently need to broaden our horizons, focus on the transcendence of the nation and the country, and the co-existence and co-prosperity of mankind, and no longer allow ourselves to inherit traditions and fix our eyes on the family.</p>
<p>Postscript: I had just finished drafting this article when I suddenly received a letter from a friend in Changsha, saying that his family was being bullied and their ancestral property was being encroached upon by a neighboring family, and they are now in litigation, asking me to invite friends to forcefully issue public votes. Because it is related to this article, I have attached it as a note.</p>

<p>— Hongshui</p>
<p>Since Miss Qian, a typist, was newly hired at the Changyun Company, the huge office felt much more lively. Mr. Yuan Hao, who had always been taciturn and looked stern, now often floated with a smile and chatted with Miss Qian. As for Mr. Ding, who has always been known as the (young master), he always keeps his hair smooth, his trouser creases straight, and Mr. Hong, the accountant's loud and endless voice, goes without saying.</p>
<p>In short, everything has lost its normality since Miss Qian came and added a touch of red to the myriad greens.</p>
<p>Every morning, when Miss Qian's beautiful figure is about to catch the eye of every colleague, everyone will ask this shy Miss Qian good morning in a gentle and kind tone. Her fluffy hair brushed her forehead, good delicate peach cheeks, blue eyes, bright red lips, her face applied with a thin layer of fragrant powder, wearing a bright and dazzling dress, and even wearing rings and watches with precious light and pearl energy. Her decoration in this office is just like that (shadow enamel) vase on the table!</p>
<p>Jing, Wen, and Qin live in Dormitory No. 6. One month later, under the moonlight one night, Jing suddenly talked about it with great interest.</p>
<p>(Mr. Ding and Miss Qian seem to have something going on?)</p>
<p>(Oh?) Qin straightened her ears and stretched her neck, expressing extreme welcome to the following.</p>
<p>(That's right, I have noticed this too.) Wen also said as if he had caught iron evidence about their (sexual problem).</p>
<p>(Why?) At this time, Qin had put down a book about the Camellia Girl that she was engrossed in and raised her head.</p>
<p>(Qin, are you still pretending? They often go in and out of parks, movie theaters, and dance halls in pairs. Don't you know or have you not noticed?) Jing said.</p>
<p>(That's right! This is absolutely true.) Wen chimed in.</p>
<p>(Is this worth making a fuss about in this era of open social interaction?)</p>
<p>(Then are you saying that there is nothing wrong with them? Okay! Let me and Wen think of a good plan to test the degree of their love for you to see!) Jing said, looking up at the eyeballs and frowning, as if thinking deeply about something.</p>
<p>The next day. It was Saturday afternoon. Mr. Ding suddenly received a letter in which Miss Qian asked him to watch a movie at the Carlton at 3 pm on Sunday? At the same time, Miss Qian also received a letter in which Mr. Ding invited her to talk at Zhao Feng Park at 9 am on Sunday? The wording of the two letters was very simple, and each recipient only glanced at them hastily, but they could all get a kind of pleasure.</p>
<p>Miss Qian did indeed arrive at the park early in the morning. She looked around and around until after eleven o'clock. Not only did she not see Mr. Ding's shadow, but she also inadvertently ran into Jing, Wen, and Qin's friends who she hated. She was really embarrassed to the extreme!</p>
<p>Mr. Ding, who had been standing in front of the Carlton door for a long time, had already bought two flower floor show tickets and held them in his hands, almost sweating. He watched a pair of beautiful people fill the seats one after another. The pleasant music also stopped, and the movie started. However, the beauty who wrote the letter inviting him to watch the movie丨Miss Qian's arrival was not seen. At this moment, he was so anxious and resentful that he could not add to it, but he still had to meet a group of smiling brothers, naturally the old Jings, the inventors of the love test in Dormitory No. 6!</p>

<h3 id="e182">Matching Eight Characters <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Shizi</p>
<p>(A Jin, I told you to invite the master, did you invite him?)</p>
<p>Mrs. Wang called A Jin to invite Mr. Zhang, the fortune teller of XX Road, to come and match the marriage for the second young master after dinner. (Madam! The master has been invited. He is waiting in the hall now. Please go out to talk to him.) A Jin replied.</p>
<p>(Madam, you are out. How have you been?) Mr. Zhang sat in the hall and saw Mrs. Wang coming out from inside at a glance, and immediately stood up from the chair and greeted her with a smile.</p>
<p>(Please sit down, Mr. Zhang! I invited you here today not for anything else, but because my second young master is now seventeen years old, and it is time to find a match. I am thankful that several relatives and friends think highly of him, and many wedding invitations have been sent from all directions. I think marriage is a major matter and should not be taken lightly. Whether the couple will get along well in the future depends on whether the eight characters are chosen appropriately now. If one is careless and mismatches the conflicting eight characters, then one's happiness will be completely buried. So I am asking you to come today to match these eight characters and choose a compatible one so that I can proceed with the engagement.) After Madam finished speaking, she took out a roll of red paper from her pocket and handed it to Mr. Zhang to assess and match.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang saw a stack of eight characters, looking at this one and looking at that one, muttering ghosts and spirits in his mouth, and turning the zodiac signs in his hands, and slowly said; (Madam, please listen quietly! This eight character of the Jin surname is not good to use because there are two layers of Seven Killings, the life is too hard, and the Li surname is not good to use either, because there is an Injury Officer in the fate. The book says that if a man has a Yang Blade, he must remarry, and if a woman has an Injury Officer, she will definitely overcome her husband. Therefore, although I heard that Miss Li is virtuous and knowledgeable, this injury officer is a big problem and must not be used.)</p>
<p>(Sir! Then how about one of the Chen surnames? I heard that this young lady is also very gentle and capable. If the fate is good to use, that would be the best.)</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang hurriedly picked out the Chen surname's eight characters and carefully looked at it, and then moved his five fingers east and west for a while to calculate, shaking his head and saying; (Madam, this eight character is even worse. There is a Yin Yang Cross in the fate, which means overcoming the in-laws.)</p>
<p>(Don't calculate, sir. Burn this eight character. How can you take out the life of a public mother and harm people?) Madam was full of anger at the time, and snatched the eight characters from Mr. Zhang's hand, struck a match, and burned it before saying again; (Although I am already sixty years old this year, I still want to live, so I hate it the most when people take out the eight characters of a public mother. Sir!</p>
<p>Please check other ones.)</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang laughed secretly in his heart, thinking that he had said (offending the mother-in-law) in his mouth and made her old man so anxious, so he pretended to be extremely solemn, and checked the stack of eight characters again, muttering in his mouth again;</p>
<p>(This one is guilty of looking forward to being a widow, it is not good to use, that one has many seals in the four pillars, and will be red-haired and sleepless in the future, it is not good to use either.) Later, he discovered a Hong surname, who had a relative relationship with himself, and then said; (Okay, okay, this eight character is born on the day of longevity, the official star is revealed, and the wealth and seals are all complete, named San Bao, which can be predicted to be prosperous for the husband and benefit the children. It is truly a life of wealth and honor, and there is nothing better.)</p>
<p>When Mrs. Wang heard that the Hong surname's eight characters were so good, she was overjoyed and smiled and nodded, saying; (Okay, I am very satisfied with such a good eight character. This is also the blessing of the second son. Now I don't need to check anything else. I am determined to use this one, sir, thank you for your trouble.)</p>

<h3 id="e183">Even Stronger Than a Big Sale <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Wenbing</p>
<p>丨Description in a Lecture on National Economics丨</p>
<p>After eating a late breakfast at nine o'clock, I had just picked up the pen and wanted to write something deceptive丨writing, when Guan Ren suddenly came in excitedly. He stepped over the threshold and said the first sentence;</p>
<p>(I'm here to invite you to buy cheap goods. XX Company is still having a big sale, buy one get one free, and free gifts!)</p>
<p>(Why are you so flustered, speak slowly丨Please sit down!) I stood up and shook hands with him tightly, and continued to say;</p>
<p>(There are so many tricks in Shanghai. Various shops have at least four fun times a year. What sales, price cuts, cheap sales, big auctions, and the words spring, summer, autumn, and winter are crowned according to the different seasons, with flowery trimmings, mouths singing and shouting, and drums and music playing. In addition, there are several anniversaries and Dragon Boat Festival and Mid-Autumn Festival, which are crowned with the words (special) big sale. People who come to Shanghai for the first time often fully believe that things they usually need should be bought at this time.</p>
<p>In fact, to be honest, once the goods are in the hands of merchants, will we really enjoy cheap goods? At most, we can slightly leak a little profit from the big sale tricks of earning a few less. When everyone goes to buy, the goods are sold even more, and the merchants will become even richer. Moreover, if you are not careful, you will be unexpectedly fooled. Therefore, many people who are used to living in Shanghai do not regard big sales as a great opportunity.)</p>
<p>(Then, according to you, we don't need to go to XX Company today!) Guan Ren was a little disappointed, supporting the back of his head with both hands, and lying half-inclined on my wooden bed.</p>
<p>(Yes, I don't agree with going! 丨丨It's really hard to say myself, not long ago, I was fooled once, and I bought a pair of overshoes for four coppers, which was considered cheap, but when I brought them back, I only wore them twice, and there were two copper-sized holes in the bottom. Guan Ren, think about it, is it cheap or not?)</p>
<p>Guan Ren was completely convinced by me.</p>
<p>(That's good, saving a few dollars, life next month will be more secure!)</p>
<p>(That's right! Speaking of big sales, I can also tell you something worth studying. Fukuda Tokuzo said in a lecture on national economics ····· In one year, the price of ginseng in Shanghai and other markets in China plummeted ····· So, not knowing on whose idea, a lot of the precious ginseng was burned at the Incheon pier ····· This matter, from the point of view of (things), is very unreasonable, because it is very effective to use this thing as medicine. Now, this useful thing is burned without hesitation. People who don't know it will definitely think it is a waste and uneconomical, but in fact it is very economical. How can I say that? Because the people who bought ginseng immediately came to buy it when they heard about the burning of ginseng at the Incheon pier, so in less than a few days, the ginseng market in Shanghai recovered, and the remaining ginseng was sold at a very high price. In this way, selling the burned ginseng at a high price is more profitable than selling all the ginseng at a low price.</p>
<p>There are many people in the world who want to eat ginseng but cannot get ginseng to eat. At this time, many ready-made ginsengs are burned. This is called being in line with the way of economics. Studying this kind of economics is called national economics.</p>

<p>(Teacher-student cooperation), these four words, the taste of these four words, can be seen, heard, and tasted everywhere in the weekly, in the lecture hall, and in the office. This is the most unique thing about our school that is worthy of showing off to others. X X X X</p>
<p>Late registration is a waste of studies, so the Academic Affairs Office has to make this regulation; each person must pay an additional registration fee of one yuan per day (limited to five days, the same for more than five days as for five days), regardless of whether there is a reason or not, all are treated the same. This is enough to show the impartiality of our school. X X X X</p>
<p>Although school starts on September 15th, you can come to school to register, pay fees, and register after the Double Tenth Festival. This is not to be greedy for some income. Our school has always been committed to helping those who have dropped out of school.</p>
<p>X X X X</p>
<p>One, two, cars whizzed by; three, four, cars whizzed by. This is because the office staff of our school took the unexpected income of thousands of yuan from the late registration fee to go to the Qingyise Restaurant or Yipinxian to enjoy themselves. X X X X</p>
<p>This is probably because applying snow cream is not enough, and you also need to absorb some silver chalk dust flying out of the blackboard. Otherwise, why do female students always have to sit in the front row of the classroom during class? Although our school has not explicitly stipulated this semester.</p>
