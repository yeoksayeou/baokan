<p>— 彬</p>
<p>東北半壁河山。在不抵抗之亂命下。覔不崇朝而盡易其顏色極目關外白山黯淡。黑水鳴咽。國人固已疾首痛心於庸懦昏闇者之負國誤民矣而今錦州再陷熱河告急。被負有捍宼守土之重責之正式軍旅竟仍奉命撤退。全國軍人。除唯一之馬占山將軍而外。都互相觀望從無一人攘臂先呼率師抗暴嗚呼。我人民榨取血汗以養二百餘萬之軍隊。果僅爲作少數野心家之工具助長内亂。虐毒人民。以造成分崩離折之混亂局面者耶</p>
<p>聞東北軍撤退時。士兵號哭。斷析槍枝。下級官佐。亦都極爲憤激托故退職者。爲數極多。兵士甚且表示但能得機會與日軍拼命。餉盡彈絕亦所甘心有如斯旺盛之士氣有如斯堅決之軍心而彼醉心權利甘願誤國之徒竟不能用卒使關外河山整個淪亡敵騎迫近患成心腹在此種事實敎訓之下。吾人應已瞭然於惟人民自己之武力。乃能可恃。今後如欲自救救國。必先準備自己之武力。與帝國主義者及一切危害我國家人民利益之惡勢力。作堅决之奮鬥。</p>
<p>在錦州危急之際。在東北正式軍隊全師撤退之時。其負城固守　死抗敵者。厥惟義勇軍。卒以衆寡不敵。錦州被陷。其後各地義勇軍愈益紛起。作戰益力。打通線一帶。重創强敵。遼吉各地。隨處襲撃使敵疲於奔命聲勢極盛此抗暴禦侮之義勇軍。蓋即我人民之武力爲我國家爭國魂爲我民族爭生存。忠勇激越誠足以動天地而泣鬼神。吾人敢正告世界列强中國雖有始終不抵抗之軍旅長官。中國人民决不作亡國之人民。同時吾人更敢斷定今日我人</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>民如欲自救救國。决不能徒日向彼擁兵稱楚者呼籲　　蓋國　民命　非彼輩所恤。國爲我人民之國救國之責即應由我人民决然奮起。切實負荷。　　今日我國家我民族已臨到生死　上。我人民决不容再遷延苟安應一面嚴厲督促政府尊重人民公意。底定國事。挽救危亡如其不能。則當以有效有力之行動。尋求最後之出路。同時在另一方面則應以全力援助關外艱苦奮鬥之義勇軍并各地自起組織。準備自己之武力。以爭奪我國家我民族之生存。以拔救我人民於痛苦之深淵。</p>

<p>他在六個月前從美國紐約出發。不久就可到達英倫。出發時。身邊不帶一個錢。一路上只替人家做些零星的工作。借此餬口。那專充女侍者的女郎是一位二十二歲的倫敦女學生。伊希望將此次經歷所得。著作一部書。目前伊正在俄羅斯。兩年後方可回國。那一面旅行一面轉動裙　的婦人。是一個失業者的妻子。已生有三個子女。負擔很重。此次是有人和伊賭東道。說伊决不能辦到這回事。伊不服氣。就不名一錢的動身上道。伊已經過了四分之三的路程。還是精神勃發。毫不困惓。更有一人。是一個十四歲的孩子傑克鄔爾哈ＪackＯldham和他的父親同坐着一輛雙座自由車周遊世界。他們在八個月前離去倫敦此刻正在日本。途中敎人彈奏琵琶。維持他們父子的生活。更有一位周遊世界的女性。是馬嬌麗祁魯斯女士ＭissMarjorieGilrutb伊投身在一艘小輪船中。充一個普通的水手。每天早上五點半起身。做水手的工作。有時並且把舵。刻苦異常。伊的目的。就是要遊歷世界一周。</p>

<p>— 劉仲養</p>
<p>曩於北平一旗籍友人家。見有九九消寒圖之製。云係傳自大内。意者御溝流水。紅葉題詩。宮女多才。閒抒幽興也。其製以尺幅鈎（庭前楊柳珍重待春風）九字於。張之壁間。實開日曆之先河。字用雙。鈎劃皆空其中。以便塡滿。蓋廢曆於冬至日起爲入九。計九九共八十一日。而此九字。則每字九劃。共合八十一劃。於入九日起。每日取筆塡一劃。每塡滿一字。即知已過一九。及九字塡滿。則知九盡春回矣。此九字辭意雙佳。如用彩色略繪樓台楊柳。以爲襯托。固一幅絕妙之閨閣書齋點綴品也。</p>
<p>自九一八事變以來·舉國共憤。然愚以爲報仇雪恥。非旦夕間事。必須持久而後有功。尤必須全國一心。且人人皆應有引雪恥爲己任之精神而後可。敵國之所以能萬衆一心以謀我者。亦由其於幼稚敎育。即引誘獎勵。使每個學生腦筋中。咸充滿侵略思想。浸潤灌溉。非一日也。吾國國恥多矣。而尤以二十一條爲最。愚因倣消寒圖之製。作一國恥掛圖。懸於書齋。俾觸目而驚心。其製用雙鈎法。鈎成（國恥）二字於大幅紙上。字大盈尺。因國恥二字。恰爲二十一筆。即將二十一條條文。於每劃中書一條。按條約之次序。與筆劃之先後書之如。如以後取消一條。即塡一劃。必俟塡滿。始得除去。愚以爲敎育當局。大可採此意。變通改作。製一更完善之國恥圖。頒發全國學校。懸之課室。由敎師於授課之先。指斯圖誡學生以勿忘國恥。成於每日第一課行之。亦吳王夫差使人立庭而呼。示不忘越仇之意也。</p>

<p>天一公司又一慕維通有聲出品。聽見現在已經開始攝製了。該片的情節是哀豓的。描寫一個性情極柔弱的女子。一生都聽憑著運命的擺佈。一點没有反抗的力量。伊因爲不敢反抗家庭。犧牲了自已的多情的伴侶。去和一個素不相識的男子結婚。幸而那男子也是一個温柔而多情的靑年。因此伊也享受著不少家庭的幸福。一年以後。伊並且做了母親。但是運命之神又來播弄伊了。伊忽然遇見了從前的情人。因爲莫須有的嫌疑。伊竟被翁姑　了出來。回到母家去。家裏不收空。於是又從了伊從前的情人的要求。實行同居。那情人的家境很淸貧。生陰還是甜蜜的。後來。他竟受不住生活的重壓。離開這世界了。自然伊更墮在悲苦的處境中。伊覺得茫茫人世。再也没有伊可親的人。忽然一念之見。想起伊的兒子。於是竟到前夫家去偷看伊的孩子。乘人不備。抱了就走。終於被他們發覺。追了出來。結果伊是被火車輾死了。該片由邵醉翁導演。陳玉梅主演。片名已經定爲「芸蘭姑娘」。按陳是善演悲劇的明星。該片由伊主演。將來成績之佳。自可想見了</p>

<p>— 求幸福齋主人</p>
<p>第一回　絕代名倡索居懷美眷　異鄕學子浪跡締奇緣</p>
<p>伊旣縹渺雲天。絕無表示。敎他撫躬自思。以一個少不更事的學子。焉敢冒昧唐突。多有深求。便也從未存過什麽意外之想。狎褻之念。只當伊是個胸無塵俗的謫世仙姬。空谷幽蘭的女中高士。有緣親近。勉强算伊是個膩友。就應當適可而止。不能再作進一步的干犯了。所以這兩個人因有這些無形扞格。諸般的隔閡。便無論形迹是怎樣相親。情意是恁等無間。郤總未能推誠相與。掬心相示。爲何項澈底的談判。謀一個根本的解决。徒使梁笑雲怏怏於心。百無聊賴。只猜不定天意的所在。說是無緣吧。怎麽世上竟還有這樣一個可愛的人被我遇着。說是有緣吧。郤又這設難於撮合。難於操縱。老是模不着一些兒邊際。殆又好似冥中暗有報應。她生平耍弄人太多了。天郤要這樣以其人之道施其人之身。在開始耍弄伊使伊對於這個人。一時撈不着。又放不下。似可得。又似可失。老在啼笑皆非的情緒中過日子呢。這一天。伊隔夜在某總裁宅裏打了一宿牌。天將亮才回來就寢。睡到下午一點掙扎着起身。兀自精神困倦。渾身的不自在。老媽子丫頭們替伊熬好了一碗燕窩鷄粥。捧上來請伊多少喝幾口。伊端起碗就覺胸口滿滿的。沉沉的。似有一塊石頭在擱淺着。粥是無論如何吃不下了。那近來多少天解不開的一椿煩悶。反又驀地勾上來。暗想姓安的他倒有三四天没來了呢。這個人爲什麽這般可愛。又這般可惡。知道克一個人坐在家裏發煩。怎麽不來陪伴我呢。正默默地焦念着。渴盼着。忽地聽得外面車夫在高聲吆喝。彷佛是喊的安先生來了。接着又是一片皮鞋聲在院落裏踼躂踏得極響。不由芳心大震。急待走到房門口去迎迓。欲知來者究是何人。且看下回說出。</p>

<p>歐亞航空公司前派機航組主任史密德·營運組主任李景樅·及機師盧慈等、赴西北籌備試航、業已成功歸來、李史等於十二日自平抵京昨日午後三時、自京來滬、於四時三十五分、到達本埠虹橋飛機塲、此次試航、途程之長、勝過於林白克、實可打破遠東航空界紀錄、歐亞公司全體職員、均到塲歡迎、茲將詳情分誌於下、</p>
<p>歡迎人員昨晨該公司接得在東京李氏電報、謂於午後三時、自京乘機來滬、該公司接電後、即於午後二時餘、率全體職員、到站歡迎、計有副董事長雙淸、德籍董事馮錫克·華董事兼郵政匯業儲金局局長劉　藩·兼郵政局長錢春祺·財務組主任汪子瀚·秘書孫慕唐·沈亞尼·及滬站主任職員等、</p>
<p>到滬情形　午後四時三十五分衆見歐亞一號機自遠而至渺小如　蜓翺翔雲漢、翻騰太空、乃楊旂幟巾帽等歡迎未幾一號機飛至虹橋飛塲、環行數週下地、機中有五人、即營運組主任李景樅·機航組主任史密德·德國漢沙航空司公代表惠而脫·機師盧慈·及機師之助手等、李等自機身出後與公司中人握手、狀甚欣悅、并由雙淸之女公子守庸女士獻鮮花多束於衆人、以祝此次試航之成功、</p>

<p>李氏談話　新聲社記者昨赴虹橋飛機塲、晤李景樅氏、詢以此次試航西北之經過、據談頗詳、且多珍屑、李云、李云、自北平至迪化、共有四千四百餘公哩、約合八千餘華里自上月二十二日晨間七時、自平起飛、十時達歸化略停、加油再飛、於午後四時餘抵弱水河、停於古城中、至二十一晨、駕機再飛、至貯油地點、再落地加油已在午刻、乃仍留弱水河、至二十二晨、始飛向迪化、於午後三時到落該處、新疆省主席金樹仁率各機關人員歡迎因飛行抵該處、爲破天荒第一次、</p>
<p>古城一瞥　記者又詢以西北情形及古城之風景、據李談、所謂古城者在弱水河之旁黑城子前、城郭已掩埋土中、不易辨認僅隱約流露、具破瓦頽垣之形迹而已城之面積約一哩週園、係建自漢代、迄今達二千餘年、城中不但無人畜、即水草房屋等亦無、滿地係沙漠漫</p>

<p>無垠入　間天地變色陰　　常</p>
<p>西北槪况　李氏又談西北情形謂西北天氣甚寒試航時機上均有御寒器具入晚更冷胡地玄冰邊士慘裂昔人之言今日見之夜則羣獸哀號自平之迪化此四千四百餘公里中不是高山即是沙漠河流甚少自包頭至新疆邊境哈密共有一千餘公里其間均係沙漠人迹絕鮮其餘各地亦均荒僻異常迪化係新疆之省會但不甚熱鬧比較繁盛者則爲達城在天山之南西北漢人旅居者甚少以同人爲多數土耳其人及印人之經商　地者亦不少云</p>
<p>正式飛航　此次該公司之西北試航成功實出於意料之外事前英德人士均猜測　不易成功　此成績該公司甚爲歡慰、現已向德國　買飛機四架、預備正式飛航之用開航期刻尙未定、須經董事會議决、大約在今春三月間實現、此後飛航自滬至新疆迪化、祇須二三日到達與前　涉道途、相去不啻天壤云、</p>
<p>帶回郵件　聞郵局中人言、歐亞航空公司、前派歐亞一號機試行飛航北平新疆新線、旣安抵迪化後、復於　月七日起程飛回、帶回郵件少許、該項郵件、自迪化郵局一月七日發出、其寄交上海之一部份、已於昨日（十二日）晚、由京滬夜車轉遞到滬計在途僅有六日、其轉遞之迅速、實開中國交通史上未有之新記錄云</p>

<h3 id="c210">畸形發展的上海社會 <a href="#c210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— 綿翼</p>
<p>我們試放眼一觀上海現社會上一般的現象，有一種普遍的病態，便是畸形的上海社會的發展象，在平常我們本也看不到什麽特異的徴象，但是用顯微鏡加以仔細的分析，社會上一切的罪惡，都可以歸納到這畸形發展的社會裏，可以得到確切不移的答案·</p>
<p>我們知道無論什麽事物，必須有平等的發展，方可以漸求進步，反之，一件事丨是時代的落伍者退化着，而同時同一件事却超越在時代的前面進步着；這種矛盾的進化，丨畸形的發展丨是决没有好的結果，甚而至於把事情弄得糟到不可收拾的地步，現在我們拿社會上的事實來證明：</p>
<p>社會上一般人們的普通的生活，没有一個人是滿足現在的情形，而不想向更安逸舒適的途上走，但是窮人的生活仍逗留在上古時代的日出而作，日入而息，自食其力的辛苦生活，而同時富翁們却擁着嬌妻美妾，住着洋房，坐着汽車的享福生活，這種貧富階級的生活的懸殊，是社會上一種最顯著的現象·</p>
<p>因着這種現象而發生的結果，便是個人生活的不安定，因爲每個人都羨慕着，要想得到比自已更舒適的生活，而不滿意自己現在所過的生活，於是用種種方法，去追求那新的舒適的生活，而社會上種種的罪惡，都發生了·</p>
<p>這種病態是怎樣發生的呢？簡單地一句話，便是社會的畸形發展，歐美各國的生活，是比中國安定，他們是坐汽車，吃大菜，住洋房，跳舞，裝飾，樣樣都比中國要高上幾倍，這種消費是中國人所渴望，而亟想摹倣的，但是他們的生產怎樣呢？手工業時代是過去了，鐵工業隨着時代的序幕而到最後一幕了，因着科學的發達而進展到機械的電工業了，同時我們中國的生產，却仍是十八世紀的手工業，還没有進十九世紀的鐵工業，更不要說二十世紀的電工業了·</p>
<p>現在我們可以知道歐美各國社會生活的安定，是由於生產與消費是並行發展的·中國社會生活的不安定，便是由於畸形發展，只學二十世紀的消費，不學二十世紀的生產，怎麽社會要不現着隉阢的不安現象呢？</p>

<h3 id="c211">一幕憤慨劇 <a href="#c211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>這一幕憤慨劇發生在砲台灣車站上··</p>
<p>是在上午九點鐘的時候，火車開後不多辰光，三四個拾煤屑的孩子在軌道中拚命地搶着剛散下來的煤屑，幾輛黃包車很幽默地停在軌道旁，車夫們都蹲在車前狂抽着紙烟。</p>
<p>車站上躺着幾張長椅，間有一二個工人模樣的安閒地坐着，在某一角落裏，坐着一個穿着警士服的靑年，在翻着當日的日報看，很嚴肅地，像在注意一椿很重大的新聞似的。</p>
<p>他是鐵路警察敎練所的學生，名陳玉明，是一個熱血的靑年。</p>
<p>突然，他像感到一個重大的刺激似的，閃的跳了起來，深凹着的二隻大眼森森地發出一陣火光，方額上的靑筋一根根地彈了出來，他「啊丨」地狂嘯了一聲，又坐了下去，又開始在報上找尋什麽似的。</p>
<p>一二個工人模樣的很無意識地向他望了一眼，仍舊很安閒地坐着。</p>
<p>他第二次跳起來以後，拚命地把幾張報紙亂撕，「嘩！嘩！嘩」地發出一種聲音，一刻，五方尺大的地上散滿着腐乾般大的碎紙。</p>
<p>幾個拾煤屑的孩子也站了起來，用着輕微的北方言語，和同伴私語，一二個工人模樣的又向他望了一會。</p>
<p>陳玉明是個多血質的靑年，這次日本用暴力侵佔東北後，他心頭發生一種劇烈的憤激，一朶血紅的火熖在他心頭燃燒，一隻警鐘在他腦筋裏狂嘯。</p>
<p>突然，他又像瘋狂般地大吼了一聲：</p>
<p>『要亡了喲！我的祖國！』</p>
<p>他像一隻掉了繮繩的野馬，他像一隻跳出了樊籠的巨獸！狂駛地跑進鐵路警察敎練所的廚房，很殘忍地，很迅速地，用一把晃亮的菜刀，把左手上的中指截去了半叚，血，是像開放了的自來水，流呵！流呵！染濕了地，染濕了衣。</p>
<p>一幕悲劇就這樣地閉幕了，陳玉明躺在地上暈了過去。</p>
<p>翌日某報上刋着一叚新聞；</p>
<p>「鐵路敎練所學生陳玉明，河北北平人，二十三歲，昨晨九時許，突至廚房取菜刀，斷去左手中指半叚，血淋如注，一時暈倒，據云，該生平日非常關心國事，屢思投筆從軍，奔赴東北効命，只以無緣作罷，一時憤激故而出此；後該所將該生送入海濱醫院醫治。」</p>

<p>— 陶小桃&lt;</p>
<p>我們在家中或學校中以及其他一切的地方，對於火燭總要特别的留心。如果不留心，小則燒壞東西，大則燒壞房屋，燒死人，這是多麽的可怕啊！</p>
<p>當我們睡覺的時候，蠟燭，洋燈，千萬不要點着在床頭，以免意外的危險。我們在屋子中燒飯以及燒其他一切的東西，都要時時刻刻的留意着。吃過的香烟頭不要丢在舟車中，及地板上。引火物，家中以少放爲好。燒鍋時不能使火掉在地上，這都是我們日常應該知道的，注意的。不要以爲一個香烟頭掉在地上，或家裏不要緊，最近大德輪船失火，燒死二百多人，就是因爲一個香烟頭。</p>
<p>我現在把怎撲滅火的方法，寫在下面：</p>
<p>房子一着了火，就要把屋子的窗子一起閉了起來，引火物急速移開，使外界的養氣不得跑進去，便容易撲滅。養氣有助燃性，可以使火越燒越大。然後看着火在那一邊，再用多量的水從屋頂上倒下去，火就很容易的熄了。　有些人身上着了火，便嚇慌了，趕快脫衣服，衣服還没有脫下，火已把肉燒爛了。甚而至於被牠燒死。你身上着火的時候，你須立刻睡倒在地上打滾，火焰得不着養氣助牠，也就滅了。這是一個很好的法了。</p>
<p>如果你床上的帳子着了火，你得趕快把床上的被緊壓在帳上着火處，火没有養氣助牠，也就滅了。雖然犧牲一床被，也救了房子，以及房子裏的人總算値得吧。</p>
<p>這是簡單的救小火的方法。一面施救，一面還得飛報救火隊，以防火勢變大，援救不及。</p>

<p>「科學可貴，然而若不能爲人羣所利用，對於人類便没有利益；學問的價値固然偉大，但是若不成爲羣衆所受用，便」無甚價値了。</p>
<p>這兩種種思想，就是在英國握有文藝思想權威的ＨＧ威爾斯所以要完全調換方向而成爲理想主義的小說家的動機。他爲了要實現這個信念，於是寢食俱廢的而從事創作。這樣並不是五年十年，眞繼續到六十四歲的現在；不，眞到他死去爲止。啊！偉大的信念與偉大的努力。</p>
<p>他所完成的著作，現有百數十種以上。小說，評論，歷史，眞所謂路路皆通。但是自他的一八九五年的處女作「伯父的談薈」問世以後，尤其是一九二○年出版的世界人類史綱，都站在以和平理想爲立塲來著述，確是在現代著作界中劃了一個新紀元。世界人類史綱一書各國都有譯本而普及於全世界。他眞不愧爲一著作之王了。</p>

<p>我曾經遇見幾次這樣的事·然而我分不出這是喜劇還是悲劇。</p>
<p>○　　○　　○　　○</p>
<p>有一次這喜劇或是悲劇的主演者是一個白髮蒼蒼的老頭兒·担着一個餛飩担，躑躅在靜安寺的旁邊，這時靜安寺正有廟會，求福求祿求壽求子的太太小姐們正擁擠不堪，自然，這是一個極好施財積德的時候。</p>
<p>我眼看着這老頭兒担着餛飩担在人業裏擁擠着，顫抖着的手敲着担子一頭的竹梆筒，發出凄厲的「呌喊。」突然這老頭兒和着担子一齊跌倒了，担子和老頭兒同時發出呌痛的哀聲，碗都磕碎了，餛飩都跳到地上，於是這老頭兒便號啕慟哭起來，隨手在地上拾起一塊香蕉皮，</p>
<p>「這担子便是我底老命呀，該死的，這雙不掙氣的脚，偏偏踏着這香蕉皮，活合的本錢都磕碎了，我將怎樣辦呢？天呀，我的苦命呀……」</p>
<p>他一面哭，一面訴，縱橫的老淚，一點一點的滴到塵埃，狼藉在地上的破碗和餛飩都隱若地發出沉重的嘆息。「人，」到底是能互助而富於同情心的動物，而且這時又正是最好佈施積德的時候，凄厲的哭聲打動了善男信女們的善心，於是一隻角子或兩隻角子紛紛投向這老頭兒的手裏，因爲他們知道這不僅是救了這一條可憐的老命，而且是爲自己積下了「爲善得善」的福。</p>
<p>老頭兒對着這一羣好善樂施的善男信女·一面連聲道謝，一面收拾那狼藉在地上的餛飩担，婆娑的淚眼裏透出勝利的微笑。</p>
<p>○　　○　　○　　○</p>
<p>另幾次的事實也和這次毫無二樣，不過是主演者不同。有人說·這是騙錢的花樣，上海眞是一個無奇不有的世界，然而，我想，一個白髮蒼蒼的老頭兒靠頑這花樣來苟延殘喘，不也就是一幕悲劇嗎？</p>

<p>Ｘ英美兩領事的衝突</p>
<p>上海最初劃定租界的是英國人，當然英國人想包辦租界，尤其是英國領事巴爾福的態度，更爲强硬，不許任何其他國的人民插足於租界之内。</p>
<p>自從中美中法通商條約訂定之後，美法兩國的商人援引利益均沾的條文，要求在租界以内美法兩國的商人與英人享同等的權利，於是引起了帝國主義者自身在租界内的衝突。</p>
<p>美國第一任署駐滬領事官伍耳苛特（Ｈ·Ｇ·Ｗo;cptt），在租界内首先設立領事館，高舉美國的國旗。英國領事與蘇松太道雙方反對，認爲租界以内，除英國國旗外，不能懸掛任何其他國的國旗，但是美領事伍耳苛特固執他的主張，結果只得任他懸持美國國旗，當時英國駐滬領事館仍在城内，尙未遷入租界，租界以内僅只有美國一國的國旗飄揚。　在英領巴爾福反對美國懸掛國旗的時候，香港總督並不以爲然，在香港總督致巴爾福的電文之中曾經說過：『他國官吏升起國旗，英國官吏是否有權干涉，殊屬可疑』。可見這一次駐滬英領之所以不曾和美領發生重大的衝突，全是由於香港總督不贊成巴爾福的主張原故。</p>

They began operations on the tenth. One route transports heavy troops via the South Manchuria Railway and the Siping-Taonan Railway to attack Tongliao. The Tongliao Japanese force, numbering over 3,000, has already made contact with the enemy at Qianjiadian. The Japanese army is using armored vehicles to carry infantry, cavalry, and artillery units, and is firing fiercely at our forces. They are also using aircraft to bomb various locations in Tongliao and Shuilitu. Our army is exceptionally brave and is engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy.

<h3 id="e24">The Great Significance of the Righteous Volunteers' Resistance Against Tyranny <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>— Bin</p>
<p>The northeastern half of our country's territory was lost almost overnight due to the chaotic order of non-resistance. Looking out over the Guanwai region, the White Mountains are dim, and the Black River cries. The people of our country are already frustrated and heartbroken by the betrayal of the country and the misleading of the people by the mediocre and dim-witted. And now, with Jinzhou having fallen again and Rehe in imminent danger, the formal military forces, which are charged with the heavy responsibility of defending against bandits and protecting the land, are still retreating under orders. Except for General Ma Zhanshan, who is the only one, all the military men in the country are watching each other, and not a single person is raising their arms and calling out to lead troops to resist tyranny. Alas! Our people are squeezed of their blood and sweat to support over two million troops. Are they only to be used as tools for a few ambitious people to fuel internal strife, abuse the people, and create a chaotic situation of disintegration and division?</p>
<p>It is heard that when the Northeast Army retreated, the soldiers cried and broke their guns. Lower-ranking officers were also extremely angry, and a large number of them resigned under various pretexts. The soldiers even expressed that if they could get the opportunity to fight the Japanese army, they would be willing to do so even if their salaries were exhausted and their ammunition ran out. With such a strong morale and such a firm military heart, those who are obsessed with power and willing to betray the country are unable to use them, resulting in the complete loss of the Guanwai territory, and the enemy's cavalry is approaching and becoming a threat to our hearts. Under this kind of factual lesson, we should have realized that only the people's own force can be relied upon. In the future, if we want to save ourselves and save the country, we must first prepare our own force and engage in a firm struggle with the imperialists and all evil forces that endanger the interests of our country and people.</p>
<p>At the time of Jinzhou's crisis, when the entire formal military force of the Northeast Army retreated, the only ones who defended the city firmly and resisted the enemy to the death were the Righteous Volunteers. In the end, Jinzhou was captured due to the disparity in numbers. After that, Righteous Volunteers from all over the country arose more and more, and the fighting became more and more intense. In the Datong line area, they inflicted heavy damage on the strong enemy. In various parts of Liaoning and Jilin, they launched surprise attacks everywhere, making the enemy exhausted from running around. Their momentum is extremely strong. These Righteous Volunteers, who resist tyranny and defend against foreign aggression, are in fact the force of our people, fighting for the soul of our country and the survival of our nation. Their loyalty and courage are truly enough to move the heavens and earth and make the ghosts and gods weep. We dare to solemnly tell the world powers that although China has military officers who have always been non-resistant, the Chinese people will never be people of a subjugated country. At the same time, we can say with certainty that today, if our people</p>

<p>want to save themselves and save the country, they must not merely appeal to those who possess troops and call themselves princes. For the country and the lives of the people are not what they care about. The country is the country of our people, and the responsibility of saving the country should be resolutely shouldered by our people. Today, our country and our nation have reached a critical moment of life and death. Our people must not allow further delay and complacency. On the one hand, we should strictly urge the government to respect public opinion, stabilize national affairs, and save the crisis. If they cannot do so, then we should seek a final way out with effective and powerful action. At the same time, on the other hand, we should do everything we can to support the Righteous Volunteers who are struggling hard outside the pass, and also organize ourselves and prepare our own forces in various places in order to fight for the survival of our country and our nation, and to rescue our people from the depths of pain.</p>

<p>It is said that the problem of discussing the plan and preventing independence has recently been solved by the central government. The Military Commission is affiliated with the government, but in reality, there are only two independent bodies: the Executive Department and the Political Council.

<p>(Hong Kong) Wu Chaoshu, Liu Luyin, Huang Shaoxiong, Zhang Huichang, Chen Ce, and others are still staying in Hong Kong waiting for Yu Youren to come and discuss further. Only Guan Suren and Zhan Jusi went to Guangdong to report on the twelfth. Wu said on the thirteenth that the Three-Agency System is based on the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session and should naturally be recognized. However, the scope of powers discussed at that time was very small and cannot be compared to the previous Political Branch Meeting. The comrades in Nanjing do not want Guangdong to withdraw the Three-Agency System, but the scope of their powers should be limited. Guangdong is not refusing to discuss the limitation of powers, and this matter can be easily resolved. Hu has no decision to enter Nanjing yet. Other issues are still awaiting Guangdong to send people to discuss. (Thirteenth Dispatch)</p>

<p>Reuters, December 12 - More than three thousand communists were arrested throughout Paris tonight because the Communist Party held a demonstration demanding subsidies for the unemployed in Paris. The demonstration was originally planned to be held this afternoon when Parliament convened, but the police found out about it and surrounded the demonstrators, loading them into large trucks and taking them away. No disturbances occurred.</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, December 12 - The Communist Party organized a demonstration of unemployed workers near the Chamber of Deputies. It lasted until 6:00 PM and ended because there were not many demonstrators. In addition, two thousand eight hundred people formed a procession, intending to approach the Chamber of Deputies, resulting in their arrest by the police. After being sent to various district offices to verify their identities, they were released in succession. Some foreigners were detained because their identities needed to be verified, and others were detained because they were carrying firearms. No disturbances occurred during the demonstration, and the police did not interfere severely. However, a madwoman attempted to break into the Chamber of Deputies, shouting that women should have a gallery seat, and was sent to a special clinic in the hospital.</p>

<p>Brüning Is Negotiating with Various Factions</p>
<p>To Support Hindenburg as Candidate</p>
<p>Kokumin, Berlin, December 12 - German Chancellor Brüning's negotiations with National Socialist leader Hitler and National People's Party leader Hugenberg on extending President Hindenburg's term have been declared hopeless. Therefore, Hindenburg has ordered Brüning to stop pursuing the matter. What Brüning is now doing is uniting the major parties to elect Hindenburg as the joint presidential candidate of all factions, so that there will be no other disputes during the general election. Brüning has now begun negotiations with various factions, but it has been decided not to include the Communist Party in this effort. The Social Democratic Party may also be excluded, as the attitude of the Social Democratic members has not yet been clearly expressed. Hitler and Hugenberg gave Brüning roughly the same answer: they expressed admiration for Hindenburg's integrity and incorruptibility, but said that extending the president's term would violate the constitution, so the two parties could not legally agree to it.</p>
<p>Kokumin, Berlin, December 13 - The German presidential election is scheduled for March 13. Conservative leader Count Westarp is leading a movement to unite various parties to support President Hindenburg as a candidate. He has invited leaders of various parties to meet tomorrow to carry out this matter. It is expected that the result will be the organization of an inter-party election committee to jointly carry out the campaign. The Communist Party has already nominated former presidential candidate Thälmann as its presidential candidate. The attitude of the Social Democratic Party is still unclear, but it is expected that it will also nominate its own candidate.</p>

<p>Strongly Advocating Writing off War Debts</p>
<p>Lausanne Conference Will Be Rescheduled Again</p>
<p>Reuters, Rome, December 12 - The Fascist Party clearly supports the policy of canceling reparations and debts. This morning, Mussolini's personal newspaper, Il Popolo d'Italia, published a passionate argument calling for the erasure of a tragic war debt. It discussed the reparations conference that will open on January 25, saying that something must be done this year to save the world from its current panic. If humanity endures a winter even worse than the present one, the consequences will be unthinkable. The only urgent action that can be taken now is to relieve Germany of its reparations payments. This move will naturally lead to a revision of all debts between the Allied countries. If the Lausanne Conference conducts purely academic research on the reparations issue, it will be of no benefit. This problem must be solved with political steps. According to the newspaper, the Lausanne Conference must cancel the numbers on both sides of the ledger in the Great War accounting. The first step should be to cancel German reparations, because Germany is currently unable to pay and will not be able to pay for many years to come. This article has caused a profound impression, as it must have been printed with the government's permission.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, December 12 - According to official sources today, the French government has indicated that France is unable to confirm January 25 as the date for the opening of the Lausanne reparations conference, because the reorganization of the French cabinet may require a slight delay in the opening of the conference.</p>

<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, December 13 - With the parliamentary session approaching, the Minseito Party held a general affairs meeting in the Diet at noon today to discuss plans to deal with the government. As a result, it was decided to submit a motion of no confidence in the cabinet. The reasons are as follows: 1) Regarding the issue of responsibility for questioning the Korean plot to assassinate the Japanese Emperor, what countermeasures should be taken if a fierce dispute between the two sides leads to the dissolution of parliament? 2) If questions are raised about the issue of adding to military expenditures and the issue of post-facto commitment to the suspension of the convertible system, the meeting should not be dissolved immediately, but should proceed to question issues such as finance and diplomacy, and submit impeachment motions or motions of no confidence.</p>

<p>One of the World's Largest Projects</p>
<p>Costing Over Ten Million Pounds</p>
<p>Extensive Irrigation Area</p>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, December 12 - The Sukkur Lloyd Barrage, the world's largest irrigation project, was officially opened today by the Viceroy of India, Lord Willingdon. The flow of the 400-mile-long Indus River will be controlled by this dam, irrigating what was previously considered barren land. It is estimated that the area irrigated by this river is larger than all the fertile land in Egypt. It is estimated that 2.5 million tons of agricultural products will be produced annually, with a value of no less than 30 million pounds. The irrigation project began in 1923 and cost 15 million pounds, including 6,000 miles of canals. The dam is the largest part of the entire project, made entirely of white limestone with 66 arched domes, each 60 feet wide. Under each dome are double iron gates, weighing 50 tons. The dam is named after Lloyd because Lloyd was the Governor of Bombay Province when the project was initiated and strongly supported its completion. The Viceroy praised the achievements of Lloyd and others in his speech, and announced that the Chief Engineer, Harrison, had been knighted by the British Emperor. Many people attended the ceremony.</p>

<p>U.S. Attorney General to Investigate the Truth</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, December 12 - President Hoover discussed the situation in Honolulu with cabinet members today. Afterwards, Attorney General Mitchell stated that he would immediately go to the island at the request of the Senate to investigate the truth about the indigenous victims. Mitchell also said that there were only seven rape cases in Hawaii last year, with American women accounting for four of the victims. According to a cable from the Navy Department to the island governor, there were as many as 40 cases of indigenous men raping white women last year. The island governor replied that this statement was absolutely false. This proves that the Navy Department's description of the island's poor conditions is greatly inaccurate. It is reported that the people on the island are currently tense and eager to know how the authorities will deal with the four Americans accused of killing the indigenous people. The four Americans have been detained on a warship in the port for several days. Today, Navy Secretary Adams has ordered them to be handed over to the court for trial at the request of the civil administrator.</p>

<p>Japan Allied, Tokyo, December 13 - Six hundred employees of the Hiroo depot of the Tokyo city tram system began a strike on the morning of the 13th. Ninety trams could not operate.

<p>Hailun telegram to all newspapers: Please be aware that a calamity has befallen China. The Northeast has been lost. Jiang Province, compelled by self-defense, rose up to resist, but ultimately succumbed to a lack of strength and support, and the provincial capital fell. I am deeply grieved. However, I have received countless awards and encouragement from overseas Chinese and donations without end, which is truly difficult for me to accept with peace of mind. I have also heard that various places are enthusiastically soliciting contributions for condolence funds, causing endless disturbances. I humbly recall that the floods in central and southern China have affected dozens of provinces and tens of millions of victims. The relief efforts have already exhausted the people's strength. How can they endure further solicitations? Therefore, I request that you stop sending condolence funds. Recently, various parties have been sending telegrams to question this, and I cannot reject their kindness and affection. In the future, I will accept any voluntary donations, regardless of the amount. However, I earnestly request that all patriotic gentlemen understand my sincere feelings and no longer solicit contributions, so as to alleviate the people's burden. This is my earnest prayer. Please also convey this information to all overseas Chinese. Ma Zhanshan [with seal]</p>

<h3 id="e77">Ma Zhanshan Meets with Zhang in Harbin <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Jinghui Goes to Heilongjiang to Assume a Puppet Position</p>
<p>A Harbin dispatch reports that after the fall of Jinzhou, Japan's ideal of a unified Manchuria, Korea, and Mongolia has largely come to fruition. Ma Zhanshan, who is entrenched in Hailun, is seen as an obstacle that cannot be tolerated. Recently, the Kwantung Army Headquarters dispatched Lieutenant General Komai, along with Colonel Obara and others, to Harbin to urge Zhang Jinghui to go to Heilongjiang and carry out his so-called declaration of assuming the post of Chairman of Heilongjiang Province. They also planned to use this as a final opportunity to persuade Ma Zhanshan to surrender, instigating Zhao Zhongren to contact Ma's Chief of Staff, Xie Ke, and others to surround Ma. On the 5th of this month, Ma learned that Zhang Jinghui would be going to Heilongjiang to assume office the next day. He then traveled from Hailun to Harbin that night, accompanied by Garrison Commander Pu Dayong, Chief of Staff Xie Ke, Adjutant General Tang Fengjia, and others. Their train arrived at Songpu City at 7:40 a.m. on the 6th. From there, Ma telephoned Zhang Jinghui and invited him to meet. Zhang replied by telegram, requesting that Ma come to Harbin to meet. At 9:00 a.m. that day, Zhang sent Garrison Captain Yu Jingtao, along with Zhao Zhongren, to welcome Ma. Japanese Lieutenant General Komai and others also went along. After arriving at Songpu, Yu stated that Zhang Jinghui was determined to have Ma come to Harbin for a talk, saying there were matters to be discussed. When Komai and others saw Ma, they said they were representing the Kwantung Army Commander to greet Ma. Afterwards, they explained Zhang Jinghui's reasons for going to Heilongjiang and finally asked Ma how he was considering the proposals made by Itagaki previously. Ma replied that he had already dismissed them. Subsequently, after consulting with his entourage, Ma crossed the river after 1:00 p.m. and went to the Governor's Office to meet with Zhang Jinghui. Ma questioned Zhang's intention to suddenly go to Heilongjiang to assume office. Zhang said it was truly a last resort, and that the Japanese side had asked him to convey the following to Ma: 1. Completely cease all anti-Japanese military actions. 2. Issue a declaration to separate from the central government and the Northeast. If these conditions were met, the Japanese army in Heilongjiang would completely withdraw, and Ma would still be invited to serve as the Chairman of the province, while his own departure would merely be a temporary transition.</p>
<p>Ma remained silent. Around 4:00 p.m., Ma crossed the river back to Hailun. Zhang Jinghui then departed from Harbin for Heilongjiang at 5:25 p.m. At 12:40 a.m. that night, he arrived at Ang'angxi. Three train cars were attached on the Qi'ang Railway, heading for the provincial capital, arriving at 2:00 a.m. on the 7th. The local gentry and officials of Heilongjiang generally welcomed him outside the city. Wang Dianzhong's First Garrison Brigade set up posts inside and outside the city with strict precautions. Zhang entered the city and rested at the Frontier Defense Deputy Commander's Office. At 9:00 a.m. on the 7th, Zhang first visited the various consulates. At 10:00 a.m., he held an inauguration ceremony in the provincial government office, and announced that the provincial administration would temporarily be handled by Ji Xiang, the chairman of the Public Security Maintenance Committee, and military affairs would be handled by Ying Shun. He appointed Song Wenlin to be responsible for restoring the Finance Department, Zhang Qihui to be responsible for restoring the Civil Affairs Department, and Li Weizhou to be responsible for restoring the Industry Department. At noon, various circles in Heilongjiang Province held a banquet at the Longjiang Hotel to publicly feast Zhang. At 8:00 p.m. that evening, Zhang left Heilongjiang, still taking the special train back to Harbin, arriving back in Harbin at 2:20 a.m. this morning. (January 8)</p>

<p>A Jinan dispatch reports that Han Fuju recently appointed Li Wuchen, the chief of the military law department of his command, as the Shandong Salt Transport Commissioner, and Meng Zhaokong, the director of the supply department, as the Shandong Tobacco and Alcohol Stamp Tax Bureau Director, to reorganize tax revenues to replenish military funds. Li had already received his seal of office yesterday and officially took office today. Meng also received his seal of office yesterday and formally took office at the bureau today. It is said that the two deputy directors of salt transport in Qingdao and Yantai, under the Salt Transport Commissioner, will also be replaced. Previously, salt taxes were collected and reported to the central government by the Inspection Office. In the future, it has been decided to change this to the Transport Office collecting taxes and retaining them for the third route transport costs. The First Tax Police Brigade, which previously belonged to the central government, will also be transferred to the Transport Office. There will also be significant changes to the magistrates of various salt farms. All district branch chiefs under the Tobacco and Alcohol Stamp Tax Bureau will be changed, except for those in Tan County. Other national tax agencies, except for Ren Wenhan, the director of the Shandong Niter and Sulfur Bureau, will remain unchanged for the time being. The director of the Lu-Yu Regional Consolidated Tax Bureau (in Qingdao) and the director of the Jinan branch, as well as the Ministry of Finance's Shandong Mineral Tax Collection Office and the Tobacco Tax Bureau, will also be replaced, possibly announced tonight.

<p>A Jinan dispatch reports that more than 4,000 troops of Liu Guitang, Guo Wensheng (aka Dun Feng), and Yin Shixi, who have surrendered, have already arrived at Dawenkou. Han Fuju had previously ordered a special train to be prepared and stationed at Dawenkou to transport them to the designated location in Gaotang, northern Shandong, to await conscription. However, Liu Guitang and others requested to be conscripted and issued military uniforms at Dawenkou before marching to Gaotang. Due to disagreements over the conscription location and whether to travel by train or on foot, Liu, Guo, and Yin have been at Dawenkou for four days without any conscription taking place. Liu Guitang's representative, Xia Ziming, arrived in Jinan last night. This morning (January 11), Xia visited Han at the provincial government to discuss a resolution. The result was still to obey orders. This morning, Han personally sent a telegram to Liu Guitang at Dawenkou, asking him to urge the troops that have already arrived at Wenkou to board the train to Gaotang as soon as possible. Regarding clothing and provisions, they will receive the same treatment as the Third Route Army. All supplies needed after passing Jinan must be purchased and sold publicly. He hoped that this would be explained to his subordinates to board the train quickly to avoid public suspicion. It is expected that the three units of Liu, Guo, and Yin will comply with the order and take the train north. (January 11)</p>
<h3 id="e80">Guangdong's Measures to Suppress the Silver Industry <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Passed by the Provincial Government and Promulgated for Implementation</p>
<p>A Guangzhou dispatch reports that recently, many in Guangdong's silver industry have been engaged in manipulating finances. On a small scale, this leads to families being bankrupted, and on a larger scale, it affects social finance and disrupts the fiscal system. In recent years, there have been several crises within the silver industry, causing countless victims. The government has been aware of this and has explicitly banned such activities. However, many merchants still harbor hopes of getting away with it and continue to take risks and manipulate things in secret. When Fan Qiwu was the Director of Finance, he once drafted measures to suppress the silver industry, but the Silver Industry Association strongly opposed them, and soon after, Fan left office and the matter was suspended. Now, the Director of Finance, Feng Zhuwan, in order to fundamentally consolidate finances, has specifically added and revised the previously drafted measures, renaming them as Temporary Measures for Managing the Silver Industry. These measures have been submitted to the provincial government for approval. The main points of the measures are as follows: Those engaged in one or more of the following are considered to be in the silver industry: A. Mortgages; B. Savings; C. Deposits and loans; D. Buying and selling raw gold and silver; E. Remittances; F. Currency exchange; G. Bill discounting. Silver businesses are divided into three types: A. Silver firms; B. Exchange shops; C. Money counters. The capital of newly established silver firms should be set at 100,000 yuan or more, and the capital of newly established exchange shops should be set at 10,000 yuan or more. Those with capital of less than 10,000 yuan belong to the category of money counters. The capital of old silver firms should be set at 50,000 yuan or more, and the capital of exchange shops should be set at 5,000 yuan or more. Those with capital of less than 5,000 yuan belong to the category of money counters. Silver firms may engage in all types of business mentioned in these measures, while exchange shops may engage in items E and F mentioned in these measures. Exchange shops may not engage in items A, B, C, and D. Money counters are only allowed to engage in the exchange between silver coins and copper coins, and may not engage in other businesses. All silver firms, exchange shops, or money counters must not purchase waste silver from furnaces. Violators will be dealt with by the Finance Department. All silver firms or exchange shops must submit the name of the store, address, organization, capital amount, business scope, the name and address of the founder, and a list of shareholders to the local business tax agency for transfer to the Finance Department for approval before they can operate. A one-time handling fee of two silver dollars must be paid for the application, and the license must be renewed annually thereafter. Silver firms that also engage in other businesses, or stores that also engage in the silver industry, must divide their capital separately and not mix it. Silver firms or exchange shops may send personnel to the public market to buy and sell, while money counters may not send personnel to the market. All personnel sent to the market to buy and sell must comply with the Silver Industry Market Rules. (January 8)</p>
<h3 id="e81">Hubei Authorities Demand Old Debts from the Central Government <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>The Finance Department Sends Personnel to Beijing to Urge Collection</p>
<p>A Hankou dispatch reports that Hubei Province's finances have long been in a state of exhaustion, and education funding is especially in arrears. The Finance Department has specifically requested the provincial government to demand compensation for old debts from the central government to be stored as a fund. According to the department's calculations, the Hubei Railway Mileage Public Stock amounts to over 800,000 taels of silver. The Ministry of Communications converted the 6% interest public bonds of the third year of the Republic into over 1,159,900 silver dollars, allocated to the Ministry of Finance for special storage, with an annual interest rate of 6%. Over the years, the total outstanding interest amounts to over 891,000 silver dollars, with a total of over 2,051,100 silver dollars in principal and interest. In addition, there is an old debt that was omitted, amounting to over 310,000 taels of silver and over 70,000 silver dollars, which was also converted by the Ministry of Communications into over 511,000 silver dollars, with an annual interest rate of 1%, and it was agreed to repay it in installments, with the repayment period ending at the end of August of the 19th year of the Republic. The deadline has long passed, but no payment has been made. It has been found that the above two amounts have been designated by the provincial government as education funds. Given the current financial difficulties of the provincial treasury, it should be communicated to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Communications to allocate the funds in full for storage. Furthermore, the central government's subsidies for October, November, and December of last year were short by 1,150,000 silver dollars. The Finance Department has also sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance, requesting a swift allocation, and has sent Section Chief Gui Jingqiu to Beijing to negotiate. The original request from the Finance Department is recorded as follows: "Since being ordered to abolish the likin tax in January of last year, the finances of this province have suddenly lost a significant source of income. The newly established business tax is insufficient to offset the losses. Since the director of the department took office, he has been in a state of depletion. After considering the situation, he formulated a relief plan, tightening government expenses to reduce expenditures on the one hand, and reorganizing taxes to open up revenue sources on the other. He hoped to implement the plan and remedy the situation. Unexpectedly, last year's floods caused widespread devastation, and the people's difficulties were exacerbated. Revenue could not be increased, and all government affairs were pending. Expenditures could not be reduced, and both old and new taxes were reduced or even non-existent due to the disaster. He was in dire straits, and the only way to make up for the situation was to borrow money, borrowing new to repay old. Then, due to the outbreak of foreign troubles and tight financial conditions, borrowing to make ends meet was difficult to manage, and the old debts accumulated and the new deficits increased. From January to the end of December of last year, the provincial treasury's accumulated deficit reached over 7 million silver dollars. Now, all resources have been exhausted, and he is mentally and physically exhausted. The maintenance costs of various agencies are entirely dependent on the central government's subsidies. The central government's subsidies for the 20th year of the Republic, due to the reorganization of the central government, the remaining balance of 150,000 silver dollars for October and 500,000 silver dollars each for November and December have not been allocated. Revenue is increasingly meager, and expenditures are increasingly difficult. Schools are demanding by striking, and the military and police are blaming the lack of food. The difficult situation is intensifying. The director of the department has been tasked with rescuing the situation, but he has been working day and night without being able to make up for the difficulties. Therefore, he urgently requests that your honorable superior, considering the situation, swiftly allocate the outstanding subsidies of 1,150,000 silver dollars from last year in full, and allocate and remit them monthly in advance to provide relief, so that the current situation can be maintained and provincial affairs will not be paralyzed. The difficult financial situation of Hubei Province, in addition to sending Gui Jingqiu, the section chief of this department, to Beijing to report in person, is presented for your review and implementation with the utmost urgency."

<h3 id="e82">Hunan Anti-Japanese Association's Claims for National Salvation <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Appealing to Chiang, Hu, and Wang for Sincere Cooperation</p>
<p>Opposing Organizations That Resemble Separatist Regimes</p>
<p>A Changsha dispatch reports that with the occupation of Jinzhou by the violent Japanese, the news has caused grief and indignation among those with a sense of righteousness. The Hunan People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association specifically convened a plenary committee meeting and resolved on six measures, which were telegraphed to the central government and circulated to various provinces, urging them to advocate for unity to save the country from danger. Their telegram stated, "In our recent telegram to the Central Party Headquarters and the National Government in the capital, we stated that with the fall of the Northeast, the national situation is precarious, and the extinction of the nation is imminent. Everything is hanging by a thread. When building a house, one cannot ask for advice on the road. Our association, representing the sentiments of tens of millions of people in Hunan, respectfully presents six points of conscientious advocacy for national affairs: Mr. Chiang Kai-shek, Mr. Wang Jingwei, and Mr. Hu Hanmin are comrades of the Party and the country with a historical background, bearing great expectations for the Party, government, and military. We urge them to put aside their personal views and prioritize the nation and the state, to enter Beijing by a deadline to face the national crisis together, and not to disappoint the eager expectations of the people. We foolishly believe that the absence of any one of the three gentlemen Chiang, Wang, and Hu is not permissible. It is truly inappropriate for any one person to act alone. They should unite sincerely and help each other in the same boat. This is the first point. To unify China, there must first be a unified and sound government. We oppose the organization of so-called local political, military, and financial committees, joint defense conferences, and similar organizations under any name, to avoid repeating the mistakes of the previous provincial autonomy and political factions, where those who are divided seek to dominate and plunge the country and the nation into eternal doom. This is the second point. The violent Japanese have occupied the Northeast as if entering an unpopulated area. The country has raised millions of soldiers, but they sit idly by. The officials are merely engaging in empty talk and high-sounding arguments, which do not help the current crisis. We urge the immediate dispatch of a large army to concentrate in Hebei to actively recover the lost territory in the Northeast. If there are those who shirk their responsibilities under false pretenses, please immediately announce their crimes and abandon them together. This is the third point. As the national crisis is intensifying, the heinous communists are taking the opportunity to act. After the calamity, the suffering people are waiting for help as if they are hanging upside down. In addition to the troops stationed in various places to suppress the bandits, which the government has explicitly ordered not to be transferred, we urge the additional mobilization of elite troops to strictly supervise the security teams and achieve the merit of encircling and annihilating the bandits to eliminate their root cause and prevent future troubles. If there are officials and soldiers who fail to suppress the bandits, they will be punished to the fullest extent of the law without leniency. This is the fourth point. Disaster relief should focus on practical measures. The famine-stricken people are everywhere, and the rear is worrisome. We urge the explicit establishment of rewards and punishments to benefit the people. If there are those who take advantage of the situation and enrich themselves at public expense, they should be allowed to be executed to demonstrate trustworthiness. This is the fifth point. Political integrity should prioritize cleanliness. Corruption and bribery are the cause of chaos. From now on, we urge the thorough punishment of corruption and the purification of governance to win the people's hearts and establish discipline, without being shielded by anyone or dealing with matters leniently. This is the sixth point. The above six points are the minimum requirements for national salvation at present. We earnestly request that your honorable government (ministry) review, approve, and implement them effectively for the benefit of the country." As the country is on the verge of destruction, let us rise up together to plan for it. The telegram cannot express our utmost sorrow and indignation. The Hunan People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association respectfully proclaims, bearing the official seal."</p>
<h3 id="e83">Banditry in the Henan-Hubei-Anhui Border Region <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>A Bengbu dispatch reports that the Red bandits in the Henan-Hubei-Anhui border region had few people and guns three years ago, and their strength was very weak. However, due to frequent disasters and the people's lack of livelihood, they took risks, and the communists took the opportunity to instigate them, leading to more and more gatherings. Due to the complex terrain in the Henan-Hubei-Anhui border region, which can be used as a place to come and go and hide, they have nothing to fear, and the bandit flames have become increasingly intense. Although the various armies that have advanced to suppress them have achieved considerable results, the bandits are scattered and reappearing, and after several years, the Red bandits have not been fundamentally eliminated. The areas occupied by the Red bandits are called the Red areas, and the areas stationed by the national army and local militias are called the White areas, demarcating boundaries. Sometimes, due to the balance of power, they do not invade each other. In recent months, due to many incidents in the current situation, the defensive forces have been frequently mobilized, and the bandits have taken the opportunity to seize cities and occupy land, and their momentum has become increasingly rampant. According to those familiar with the bandit situation in the border area, 1. The 7th, 8th, and 9th regiments of the Red bandits are scattered in the Panxin shop and Wanjia shop areas in southern Henan, and one of their forces is still entrenched in the Xuanhua shop bandit nest. 2. The Red bandits in eastern Hubei, Huang'an, who are confronting the 30th Division of Li Mingzhong's troops, are part of the pseudo-13th Division and the pseudo-4th Army. The pseudo-military department and the pseudo-10th Division are stationed in Qiliping. North of Tawan Hill, the 39th regiment of the pseudo-14th Army is stationed. Near Gaojia River and Bali Bay, there is the pseudo-21st Division. Xia shop, Cai shop, Changling Hill, Changcheng Cen and other places are all disturbed by Red Guards. 3. In the Macheng area, there are over a thousand bandits at Tonggu Pass, 7,000 to 8,000 bandits at Changcheng Cen, a Red Guard regiment of over a thousand at Baima Village northwest of Huangtu Hill, a regiment of bandits at Xiajia Bay, and over a thousand Red bandits at Liushudian and Huzi Cen north of Futian River. The more than 10,000 Red bandits who previously attacked Shangcheng have all passed through Guangshan in the south. Bandits frequently disturb the areas of Ma and Huang. 4. Most of the Red bandits in the Jinshui and Guangshui areas are gathered in Moshan and Luotian, attacking and disturbing Meitian, and over 5,000 bandits have fled to Caijia River and Xima, with a tendency to harass Jinshui. Another several thousand Red bandits have attacked Guangji and fled to Caohe Town, also with the appearance of invading Jinshui. 5. The Red bandits on the Anhui border are most rampant in the areas of Huoqiu, Liu'an, Huoshan, and Yingshan. They have been repeatedly suppressed by the Yue Shengxuan department of the garrison army stationed in Liu'an, the Zheng Tingzhen department of the 25th Route Army stationed in Huo, and the Song Shike department of the temporarily compiled 2nd Brigade, but there has been no progress. It is said that there are no less than tens of thousands of bandits entrenched in the areas of Liu, Huo, Ying, and Jinjia Village. This is truly a hidden worry for Anhui Province. (January 12)</p>

<p>Mr. Chiang Kai-shek has been enjoying a peaceful life in his hometown of Fenghua since he went there for recuperation last month. Recently, due to the increasingly urgent national crisis, key figures from the National Government have successively gone to Fenghua to urge him to return to the capital. At around 3:00 p.m. on the 13th, the Zhejiang Provincial Government and the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau received a telegram from Yu Jimin, the director of the Ningbo Public Security Bureau, reporting that Chiang had arrived in Hangzhou from Ningbo at 3:00 p.m. on his private plane. Lu Dipeng, the chairman of the Provincial Government, Lu Bichou, the director of the Civil Affairs Department, Zhao Zhiyou, the mayor of Hangzhou, and Song Ziwen, who was in Hangzhou, immediately went to the Pinghu Qiuyue lakeside to welcome him. However, the plane flew and stopped at Cheng Lu's Houhu Lake at 2:50 p.m. The welcoming party then changed to small boats to welcome him on the lake. It is said that those who came with him included He Yingqin, the Minister of Military Administration, and Wang Shihe, Chiang's bodyguard. They then had dinner at Cheng Lu.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Funding for the Grand Canal Project Still Uncertain <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Disaster Relief Association Suggests Fundraising Methods</p>
<p>The Grand Canal in Jiangbei has been breached in seventeen places since the autumn. Although Ye Chucang, the former chairman of the provincial government, repeatedly guaranteed that it would be repaired in the shortest possible time, it was only after the reorganization of the provincial government that it was learned that only one-tenth of the 4 million yuan stipulated by Ye had been secured, and the rest had been subject to changes in circumstances and remained uncertain. As a result, the hundreds of miles of incomplete canal banks have not been started after five months. Initially, the local area could help raise funds, but with the national crisis at hand, the public's attention has shifted to saving the country. In addition, the starving people in the dozens of counties in Jiangbei are not sure how to get a full meal in this cold weather, and they have no energy to take care of the project. It is now heard that the Huaiyang Water Disaster Relief Association believes that construction is urgently needed, and has formulated six fundraising methods to suggest to the authorities: 1. Please allocate American wheat for disaster relief. 2. Please allocate customs surtax for disaster relief. 3. Please allocate railway surtax for disaster relief. 4. Please allocate the provincial road funds decided by the provincial government. 5. Please allocate the construction mu tax from the counties in Jiangsu Province. 6. Please allocate the land tax from the counties in Jiangbei of Jiangsu Province. It is said that the above methods have been directly presented to the National Government, but it is not yet known whether they will be approved. However, the spring floods will arrive in an instant. If the construction is delayed any longer, the counties upstream will lack water for spring plowing, and the counties downstream will be permanently flooded. At present, the engineering personnel have all been allocated and an engineering office has been set up in the Zhouhuayuan Alley. Han Guojun, the deputy director of the Grand Canal Disaster Relief Association, is currently going to Suzhou, Wuxi, and Shanghai to negotiate everything with charity groups in Jiangnan, so as to make final plans. At the end of the old lunar year, if there is 2 million yuan in cash, construction can begin, otherwise, the disaster may be great, and residents along the canal may not be able to sleep peacefully.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Lifting the Ban on the Nationwide Sale of Soy Sauce <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>The General Inspection Office Has Ordered Its Subordinates to Comply</p>
<p>The nationwide sale of domestic soy sauce has never been subject to regional restrictions. However, in the fifth year of the Republic, salt merchants in western Zhejiang proposed to the Salt Affairs Bureau to establish six rules for soy sauce workshops to purchase salt and sell soy sauce, in order to force the distribution of expensive salt and restrict the sale of soy sauce. Soy sauce made in one place cannot be purchased from another place, and soy sauce made here is not allowed to be sold there. Although this rule is limited to the five districts of Suzhou, it has affected the transportation and sale of soy sauce, and local patrol agencies have repeatedly detained and punished soy sauce. The nationwide sale of soy sauce is no longer possible. As a result, domestic soy sauce cannot go beyond the manufacturing site, but imported foreign soy sauce can be sold nationwide. This is no different from economic suicide, which has aroused the attention of the Chinese people. Therefore, in March of the 19th year of the Republic, the Legislative Yuan proposed relief, and in November of the same year, the National Industrial and Commercial Conference also decided that domestic soy sauce should be allowed to be sold nationwide. The Ministry of Industry issued three notices to the Ministry of Finance, requesting that it be implemented quickly. Last year, the General Inspection Office of the Ministry of Finance's Salt Affairs Bureau, in accordance with the order, took over the national anti-smuggling teams and set up a tax police section to complete the task. However, salt merchants in various places still requested that the transportation and sale of soy sauce be banned, and even pickles were being investigated and banned. The General Inspection Office of the Salt Affairs Bureau believed that soy sauce, according to the current salt law, has been tested and is clearly not a salt and should not be subject to the ban on transportation. Therefore, in December, it requested the Ministry of Finance to clearly instruct and approve the matter. Subsequently, the Ministry of Finance approved it. In January of this year, the General Inspection Office of the Salt Affairs Bureau, in accordance with the Ministry's order, issued a notice to all branch offices and inspection offices, forwarding it to the transport commissioners and salt transport bureau chiefs for information, and ordering their subordinates to comply. In this way, the national soy sauce industry has been relieved of its 15-year-long suffering, and the unnecessary disputes between anti-smuggling agencies and the people can come to an end. The notice from the General Inspection Office of the Salt Affairs Bureau is recorded as follows: "The Regulations on Special Permits for Salt Manufacturing stipulate that any substance containing more than 40% salt content can be regarded as a salt. Soy sauce has been tested and contains only 12.37% salt content, so it is not a salt. However, salt merchants often cite Article 5 of the Rules for Soy Sauce Workshops to Purchase Salt and Sell Soy Sauce in the Five Districts of Suzhou, approved by the Salt Affairs Bureau on December 28 of the 5th year of the Republic, to demand that soy sauce from other districts not be allowed to be sold across borders, and even pickles are requested to be banned, causing frequent disputes and difficulties in handling. Therefore, this office submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance on December 2 of last year, asking whether the cross-border sale of soy sauce, pickles, etc., should be investigated and banned, and requesting clear instructions for compliance. Now, we have received Instruction No. 49736 from the Ministry of Finance on November 22, stating that any substance containing more than 40% salt content can be regarded as a salt. Soy sauce has been tested and contains only 12.37% salt content and should not be regarded as a salt and should not be subject to the ban on transportation. This should be approved. You should immediately forward it for compliance. This order, etc. Having received this, it is hereby copied and issued to all branch offices and offices of this office, ordering them to forward it to all transport commissioners and salt transport bureau chiefs for information, and to order their subordinates to comply."</p>

<p>Fengxian</p>
<p>The Bandit Alarm in Zhetang Was Found to be a Rumor. For the past few days, society in the county has suddenly spread rumors that a large group of bandits from Taibao Ashu's old troops were entrenched outside Zhetang. The military and police authorities immediately consulted and decided to send troops to suppress them. Yesterday, Chen Jin, the inspector general of the County Public Security Bureau, led a long police force by land and water to patrol and investigate, and the area was found to be peaceful and there were no bandits. However, theft cases have occurred from time to time along the coast. They are small gangs of bandits, and the foreign sea patrol has gone to suppress them.</p>
<p>The Provincial Approval of the Fengnan Boundary Case. In the past, Taiping Township in Nanhui caused a conflict due to boundary demarcation, resulting in the destruction of the residence of He Shiyi, the head of the Nanda Bridge Security Corps. At the same time, Ye Yiyu, the assistant staff member of the district, was also beaten by the people. The dispute between the two sides was very fierce. Fortunately, Shi, Jiang, and Shen Meng of Fengnan County, who were fellow villagers, came forward to mediate. In addition to compensating for various losses, Kong, the magistrate of Nanhui County, also ordered all sectors of the township not to hold meetings or riots before the provincial government had resolved the issue. It is now known that the four townships of Miaoxi and Jinxing, which opposed the merger with Chunxian, are also willing to act in unison with the eleven townships and towns of Nanren Bridge. The township chiefs also jointly telegraphed a petition the other day. According to the approval, the case was presented, and it was found that the Ministry of Internal Affairs had previously approved that the land west of Zha Port in Nanhui County was indeed narrow and long, deviated to the west, and far from Nanhui County, while close to the Fengxian County government. The natural form was not very complete, which was indeed in line with the provisions of Article 7, Item 4 of the Provincial, City, and County Boundary Survey Regulations. It should be strictly investigated and a reorganization method should be proposed and transferred to the Ministry for verification and handling in accordance with the outline of the County Administrative Area Regulations promulgated by the Ministry. The government has ordered the department to comply and verify it.</p>

<p>A Civil Newspaper Reporter Stabbed in the Dark</p>
<p>Zhu Bingdie, a reporter for the Civil Newspaper, residing outside Guangfu Gate in this county, in the former Taiping Alley, lives in Shangshan Village, District 8 (near the market), and owns hundreds of acres of ancestral farmland. Last winter, Zhu went to the countryside to collect rent, leading to a lawsuit with his paternal uncle, Zhu Meiji, and his wife, Xu. The County Court handled the case. The other day, Zhu went to the home of a Buddhist monk, Yang, near Anzhen, in Wanli, to measure the rent. However, servants Chen Senlin and clerk Wan A'yuan came out to obstruct him, leading to a dispute. Both parties were brought to the 16th Sub-bureau of the Public Security Bureau, which had jurisdiction over the area. Zhu Meiji then incited his wife, Xu, to go to the bureau to make a scene.

Each student saved money that was originally spent on fruits to make a charitable donation. The school authorities purchased cloth and cotton and dedicated their spare time to sewing cotton clothes and trousers for the disaster victims. More than three hundred items have been made and sent to the charity association for distribution to the disaster areas. A charity fair was held the other day. Students organized a fundraising team and sold fine fruits, toys, etc. at the fair (cakes were donated by [blank] Shi Yijun, and toys were donated by Gu Lisheng).

<p>British Army Wins 2-1</p>
<p>Winning Goal Scored Through Penalty Kick at the End</p>
<p>The Malayan Overseas Chinese Football Team held the combined Shanghai-based British Army team to a 1-1 draw for eighty minutes at the baseball field yesterday afternoon. Until the last five minutes, after Yu Diao Hua's foul, the British Army's main player, Crankhan, scored a penalty kick to seal a 2-1 victory. The Malayan performance was better than before, but bad luck prevailed. The spectators sighed in regret at Malaya's third defeat in Shanghai. The referee was British Army officer Kailan.</p>

<p>Malaya's performance yesterday was much better than in the previous two matches. They frequently broke through the British Army's defense and probed the enemy's goal. They were not trapped in a corner and constantly surrounded as before. However, although there were many opportunities, they regrettably lost their scoring chances due to inaccurate shots. The center remained the guard, with Huang Jinbai single-handedly taking charge. His performance was still the strongest, saving countless balls. His skill was no less than Zhou Xianyan's. The two goals conceded were both due to his failure to save them.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Crankhan Stands Out From the Crowd <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The situation on both sides progressed and retreated, which is why the British Army's performance was unremarkable and not surprising. However, Malaya missed countless shots, and the shooting power was unusually weak and unable to score. There were many players from the B team, and their skills were generally less impressive. Only the right-winger, Crankhan, was worth watching. Crankhan was selected for the interport team. His right-wing progress was fast, his passes were accurate, and wherever his traces went, it was as if all the grass and trees were soldiers. The ball that was obtained was dangerous. The British Army's first goal was passed by Crankhan, and the penalty kick was also scored by him, so he was virtually the person who determined Malaya's fate.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Guan Xinde Opens the Scoring First <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>There were only two thousand spectators. Malaya kicked off against the wind, and for only ten minutes there was an attack and retreat. The British Army attacked the goal without success. Liang Fulai passed the ball forward, and Deng Yueyun went straight along the side and passed the ball to Li Wen in the center on the right. Li Wen got the ball and shot, and Smith kicked it out. Deng Yueyun caught it and advanced again. The British left-back Tunna kicked it into a corner kick. Deng fell very accurately. Guan Xinde attacked diagonally and attacked the ball from the goal post and rebounded. Malaya was able to open the scoring.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Redley Heads the Ball Into the Goal <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The Malayan army was in great spirits and took advantage of the victory to advance. The British Army's defensive line was broken from time to time. Guan Xinde got Yan Qisheng's ball again and shot in front of the goal, but unfortunately the shot was inaccurate. The British Army's right-winger Crankhan also repeatedly harassed, fortunately, without any trouble. After thirty minutes, Owen dribbled the ball and Gan Jinlu stopped him. The opponent Neil also ran up to assist. Crankhan rushed [blank] into the [blank], running very hard. Five forwards rushed forward. Crankhan [blank] in the center, and Redley had to head the ball with force, unstoppable and it went in. The score became 1-1, a tie. Although the British army came again, they could no longer enter. The first half ended in a draw.</p>

<p>After a break, the British team kicked off and fought hard for forty minutes without a decisive outcome. Moments of great excitement and danger arose repeatedly. Huang Jinbai handled the situation with ease and made no mistakes. Both sides had opportunities but failed to capitalize. Based on the unfolding situation, a draw seemed inevitable. Unexpectedly, in the last five minutes, Crankham attacked from the right, penetrating the penalty area. Yu Zhuohua raised his hand to block the ball, resulting in a handball. Crankham successfully converted the twelve-yard penalty, sealing Malaya's defeat.</p>

<p>Yesterday's Defeat of Shanghai Chinese Middle School: 27 to 25</p>
<p>| All Tournament Play is Now Over |</p>
<p>The final day of the Western YMCA basketball tournament concluded last night. A total of three games were played. In the final match for the Group B championship, Morning Star defeated Shanghai Chinese Middle School, seizing the championship with a score of 27 to 25, a difference of only one point. However, it is reported that Shanghai Jiangwan Middle School discovered that three players in the Morning Star team were not registered and played under false names. A protest will be filed. The other two Group A games were (1) Yishi won against Chizhi 37 to 20 and (2) Xiaguang won against Dare-to-Die 42 to 26. Details are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Group B Championship Final <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The situation was exceptionally tense. The Group B final between Shanghai Chinese Middle School and Morning Star was fiercely competitive, no less than the Group A matches. Morning Star took the initiative early, taking a 6-1 lead. Seeing the unfavorable situation, Shanghai Chinese Middle School rallied their spirits and attempted to attack, gaining momentum. Chen Weimin, Liu Jiajun, and others scored eight consecutive points, briefly taking the lead. The situation suddenly became tense, with a prolonged scramble. Morning Star's morale surged again, with Xie Ze leading the charge and repeatedly contributing to the score. The score suddenly became 14-14. Shanghai Chinese Middle School was unlucky, missing three opportunities under the basket. Morning Star, relying on Xie Ji's contributions, won the first half with a score of 18-14.</p>
<p>Shanghai Chinese Middle School launched an ineffective counterattack. As the second half began, Shanghai Chinese Middle School, with renewed spirit, worked hard, and the lineup suddenly solidified. Ye Quanlue and Wu Ruisen consecutively scored three points, reversing the situation. Shanghai Chinese Middle School took the lead with a score of 20-18. Suffering this blow, Morning Star was unwilling to show weakness and quickly rallied. Xie and Liang successively scored, reversing the score again. From then on, Morning Star maintained a slight lead, with Shanghai Chinese Middle School closely following behind. The score difference was extremely small. At one point, Shanghai Chinese Middle School trailed by only one point, with the score at 24-25. Shanghai Chinese Middle School continued to work hard, hoping to break through, but was unexpectedly scored upon by Morning Star for two more points, greatly damaging their morale. Although putting up a desperate fight, they were helpless, and time ran out, resulting in a crushing defeat. The final score was 25-27, and the championship belonged to Morning Star.</p>
<p>Morning Star Fouls and Scores: Shanghai Chinese Middle School Fouls and Scores:</p>
<p>Luo Zhaojiong: 2 fouls, 3 points Chen Weimin: 1 foul, 8 points</p>

<p>Chizhi Lost to Changyi – A Strange Occurrence: Chizhi has always been renowned, but last night they surprisingly lost to Yishi with a score of 20-37. It is indeed a strange occurrence. Yishi's skills have certainly improved significantly recently, but could Chizhi really be defeated? It was discovered that only Yang Lin Yu and Xia Yushu were present as official players for Chizhi. The remaining three players, Kong Guangyi, Gu Guangdao, and Qian Dingshen, were not present. Therefore, their defeat is understandable. First half: Yishi 24 points, Chizhi 12 points.</p>
<p>Xiaguang Crushes Dare-to-Die: Xiaguang's military strength is growing daily, while Dare-to-Die remains unchanged, lacking vitality. First half: Xiaguang 19 points, Dare-to-Die only 4 points. In the second half, Dare-to-Die worked hard and achieved some progress, but in the end, Xiaguang won decisively with a score of 42-26.</p>

<p>Players Allowed to Join Other Teams</p>
<p>The Executive Committee of the Westerners' Football Association held a meeting on Tuesday evening to discuss the dispute between the Maotai football team and the French Business football team. The following resolutions were made: (1) The Maotai football team is expelled until the end of this year's football season because the team disobeyed orders and refused to continue playing in the Group C match against the French Business team after playing half the game.</p>
<p>(2) All of Maotai's records in Group C are canceled.</p>
<p>The committee's explanation for the above resolutions is as follows: Although Maotai claimed that their refusal to continue playing was due to the French Business team's barbaric actions, according to the report from the referee sent by the Chinese Sports Association, the game was not barbaric. The French Business team did charge several times, which were quite forceful, but legal. Since Maotai did not obey the referee's orders and opinions, the committee had no room for discussion regarding Maotai. However, the expulsion is for the Maotai team, and its players are still allowed to join other teams.</p>

<p>After the establishment of the new Nanjing government, Wang Jingwei, Hu Hanmin, and Chiang Kai-shek have consistently failed to assume office in the capital. It is rumored that Sun Zhesheng, He Yingqin, Yu Youren, Zhu Peide, and Chen Youren left Nanjing one after another to separately persuade them to take office due to the lack of a political center, leaving only Mr. Lin Sen there to guard the national seal in vain. (Note) Here is a small glimpse I have written:</p>
<p>"A cauldron with three legs;</p>
<p>The three legs do not cooperate.</p>
<p>Gazing with wide eyes, piercing through the North Star Pavilion.</p>
<p>The National Government has become a large empty shell.</p>
<p>A large empty shell,</p>
<p>Doing neither good nor evil."</p>
<p>(Small note) It is said that a petition group from Anhui to remove Chen Tiaoyuan arrived in Beijing to seek an audience with Chairman Lin. Chairman Lin said, "I am just a seal keeper in the National Government, how can I be a chairman?"</p>

<p>— Yi Zang</p>
<p>After experiencing the pain of losing his wife in the tenth year of the Republic, Feng remarried a Miss Li from Tongzhou, Beijing. Miss Li graduated from Yenching University in Beijing. She was virtuous and proficient in English. After marrying Feng, she raised his orphaned children and managed his affairs in an orderly manner. Therefore, Feng favored her greatly. Because Feng did not understand English, his wife taught him English every morning, while he taught Li military strategy and party principles. The couple diligently learned from each other without regard to the weather. Feng was a firm believer in Sun Yat-sen's teachings. When he was the Northwestern Border Defense Commissioner, his house was filled with books on the Three Principles of the People. Besides reading them himself, he also encouraged his subordinates to do so. Xu, an old scholar, lived in Feng's house. Every evening, he would lecture Feng and his wife on the Book of Changes, the Book of Rites, and the Spring and Autumn Annals. They studied late into the night, year after year. Therefore, all those close to Feng envied their marital harmony.</p>
<p>Feng usually walked to his office in the new village. The office had several cars for long-distance travel. One day, his eldest son secretly took a car for a joyride. Feng happened to be going out on business. Upon learning of the situation, Feng grabbed a stick and went straight out. The son got out of the car. Feng beat him severely. His limbs were almost crippled. Zhang Zhijiang, Xiong Bin, and others rushed to intercede. However, Feng, in his rage, was difficult to persuade. Soon, his wife, Miss Li, also arrived. Seeing her son's injuries, she was filled with grief and cried out, "Even if he is completely wrong, should there be no affection at all? If something goes wrong, this son is not mine, and as a stepmother, I will not only be criticized by the world but also be accused of indifference. What about my reputation?" After saying this, she knelt on the ground, asking Feng to strike her instead. Only then did Feng's anger subside slightly. However, after returning home, Feng ordered his orderly to escort his son to the Zhangjiakou Arsenal, ordering him to learn blacksmithing. The factory director treated the son with great respect, not making him work, and settling him in an inner room. Unexpectedly, Feng secretly investigated the next day. Seeing his son living comfortably in the inner room, he was furious, scolding the factory director for shielding and concealing. The factory director had no excuse. Feng then forcibly dragged his son to the iron smelting yard, forcing him to do blacksmithing work, and fined the factory director three months' salary.</p>

<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>The New Wonders of Traveling the World: The latest wonders that we are happy to praise are five men and three women traveling the world in strange ways. One is wearing roller skates, and three are walking entirely on foot. One girl works as a waitress in each country she visits. And another woman travels while spinning a hula hoop. These unique ways of traveling are truly fascinating. The one traveling on roller skates is named James Stevens.</p>
<p>He left New York in the United States six months ago. He will soon arrive in the UK. When he left, he had no money. Along the way, he only did odd jobs to make a living.

<h3 id="e125">Nine-Nine Cold Dispelling Chart <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Zhongyang</p>
<p>I once saw a Nine-Nine Cold Dispelling Chart in the home of a Manchu friend in Beijing. It was said to have been passed down from the palace. It evoked images of palace ladies, talented and idle, expressing their feelings with poems on red leaves floating down the palace moat. The chart consists of nine characters (庭前楊柳珍重待春風 - 'The willows in the courtyard are cherished, awaiting the spring breeze') calligraphed in thin strokes on a foot-long scroll to be hung on the wall. It predates the calendar. The characters are outlined in double strokes, with the interior left blank for filling in. The winter solstice is the start of the nine-nine period, totaling eighty-one days. These nine characters have nine strokes each, totaling eighty-one strokes. Starting from the first day of the nine-nine period, one stroke is filled in each day. Each time a character is filled, it indicates that one nine-day period has passed. When all nine characters are filled, it indicates that the nine-nine period has ended and spring has returned. The meaning of these nine characters is both excellent and auspicious. If colored drawings of pavilions and willows are added to enhance it, it would make a wonderful adornment for a lady's boudoir or study.</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, the entire nation has been filled with indignation. However, I believe that revenge and redress are not matters that can be accomplished overnight. We must persevere to succeed. In particular, the entire nation must be united, and everyone must have the spirit of taking the redress of shame as their own responsibility. The reason why the enemy country can unite its people to plot against us is also because they have been inducing and rewarding aggressive thoughts in the minds of every student since early childhood education, irrigating and nurturing them, not just for a day. Our country has suffered many national humiliations, but the Twenty-One Demands are the most significant. Therefore, I have imitated the Nine-Nine Cold Dispelling Chart and created a National Humiliation Chart to hang in my study, so that it will be a shocking sight. The chart uses the double-stroke method to outline the two characters (國恥 - National Humiliation) on a large piece of paper. Each character is a foot in size. Because the two characters for National Humiliation have exactly twenty-one strokes, I will write one clause of the Twenty-One Demands in each stroke, according to the order of the treaty and the sequence of the strokes. If a clause is cancelled in the future, I will fill in that stroke. It must be filled in before it can be removed. I believe that the education authorities could adopt this idea, modify it, and create a more perfect National Humiliation Chart to be distributed to schools across the country and hung in classrooms. Teachers can use the chart to remind students not to forget the national humiliation before starting each lesson. It is similar to how King Fuchai of Wu had someone stand in the courtyard and shout, reminding him not to forget the revenge of Yue.</p>

<p>— A Member of the Youth Aid-Horse Team</p>
<p>(11) Arrival in Xuzhou</p>
<p>On the twenty-eighth, after we said goodbye to our compatriots in the capital, we took a boat to Pukou. At this time, the gentle waves were rippling. Our bodies floated up and down with the boat, which was very interesting. I unconsciously thought I was inside a warship. The gray clouds of sorrow seemed like the smoke of the battlefield. Everything outside the boat seemed like the enemy. Therefore, my spirit became more and more vigorous and courageous. But these were all illusions. The shouts of the Zhuangshi of Tientai killing the enemy seemed to be ringing in my ears: "Ah, move forward!" It was really exhausting. My body was still in a safe area. When will I be able to sacrifice myself for the country?</p>
<h3 id="e127">A Letter Regarding Recent Artistic Trends in Paris (Middle) <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Kang</p>
<p>My teacher's selected snow scene is displayed in Room 14, in a very good position. Sheng's seascape is hung in Room 10, which is also not bad. Prince Yun, who calls himself the only exhibitor, also occupies a position near the stairs, painting a panoramic view of the Concorde. Zhang Chengjiang sent two sculptures, both of which were displayed, giving a boost to the Chinese sculpture world, which is gratifying.</p>
<p>More than twenty Japanese artists are exhibiting, which is noteworthy. Although there are few works of extraordinary genius, their hard work and perseverance are admirable.</p>
<p>Mrs. Besnard held an exhibition of her late husband's works, including dozens of watercolors and sculptures, with the sculptures being more refined.</p>
<p>The decoration and architecture departments have many surprising things. In short, the word "new" is the root of the strangeness.</p>
<p>Music, fashion, and dance performances are held every day or two. This year's dance is particularly wonderful. All the Danseurs and Danseuses are invited from the Paris Opera and the Berlin Opera.</p>
<p>French cuisine is boasted by the French as the best in the world. They spare no effort in promoting research. There are cooking museums, exhibitions, and lectures for people to refer to and observe, in order to achieve perfection. Recently, it has been listed as the eighth art form and officially participates in various art Salons. This autumn exhibition has a separate department dedicated to the display or performance of cooking techniques, which is one example. The general situation of the autumn exhibition is as described above. Now, I will tell you a few recent events in Paris: The world economic panic has affected the development of industry and commerce. Therefore, the number of unemployed people is increasing day by day. The so-called unemployed people generally refer to workers, vendors, etc. But I don't know that there are also unemployed people in the intellectual class, such as school teachers, stage actors, musicians, and painters, sculptors, writers, etc., who are all telling each other about the difficulty of making a living. Unemployed workers in England and Germany have what is called unemployment insurance. When they have nothing to do, they can receive some living expenses from the government to maintain their survival. In France, the national construction plan for 1932 has also been announced recently, with the aim of accommodating unemployed workers and enabling them to have work and earn money. Only the unemployed in the upper classes are not considered, which inevitably loses the essence of freedom, equality, and fraternity. The French government, in view of this, has specially organized an art (limited to painters and sculptors) unemployment relief association, with the sole purpose of subsidizing or relieving unemployed painters and sculptors. The honorary presidents, French President Doumer and Prime Minister Laval, have agreed to serve. There are six committee members, including your friend A. Pesmard, a member of the National Academy, and the rest are heads of various art groups and celebrities in the art world.</p>
<p>We departed from Pukou. We passed through Chuxian, Bengbu, and Suxian in Anhui. We stayed for a short time along the way. On the morning of the thirty-first, we finally arrived at Tongshan Prefecture (Xuzhou) in Jiangsu Province. The compatriots here are very enthusiastic about patriotism. They had already been waiting for us at the station. A welcome meeting was also held in the public education hall. After the meeting, the whole group paraded through the city. All the participating groups also joined in. There were many spectators along the way, silently moved to tears.</p>
<p>The scenery here is magnificent. The mountains are structured like a screen. The mountainsides are inlaid with sparse silver piles. One or two green old pine trees stand out in the leafless and flowerless withered bushes, seeming to express their spirit of perseverance. This is a model for our passionate youth.</p>
<p>The soil in Xuzhou is not fertile. Therefore, the citizens are also very poor and commerce is not very developed. Recently, it has also been affected by floods, making it even more desolate. Arriving here, the north wind is very strong. It is indeed not as comfortable as Jiangnan. However, we feel more and more pleased because our destination is getting closer.</p>

<p>— Master of the Seeking Happiness Studio</p>
<p>Chapter One: Unparalleled Courtesan Lonesomely Yearns for Her Beautiful Companion, Foreign Student Wanders and Creates Strange Fate</p>
<p>Since she has disappeared like a cloud in the sky, with no indication whatsoever, he can only reflect on himself. As a young and inexperienced student, how dare he be so presumptuous as to press her for more? He never entertained any unexpected thoughts or improper notions. He only regarded her as a celestial being without worldly dust, a noble woman like a solitary orchid in a secluded valley. Being fortunate enough to be close to her was already enough. He should know when to stop and not make any further advances. Therefore, because these two people have these invisible barriers and various separations, no matter how close their appearances are, no matter how intimate their feelings are, they can never truly confide in each other or reveal their hearts. There is no thorough discussion or fundamental solution. It only makes Liang Xiaoyun feel uneasy and bored. She can't guess what fate has in store. If it is said that there is no fate, how can she meet such a lovely person in this world? If it is said that there is fate, it is so difficult to bring them together and difficult to control. She can't seem to find any boundaries. It is almost as if there is a karmic retribution in the dark. She has been playing with people too much in her life. Heaven wants to use her own methods against her, making her unable to obtain this person for a while, unable to let go, seemingly attainable, yet seemingly lost, living her days in a state of laughter and tears. One day, she played mahjong all night at the residence of a certain director and only returned to sleep when the sky was about to dawn. She struggled to get up at one o'clock in the afternoon, feeling listless and uncomfortable all over. The old servant and the maids had prepared a bowl of bird's nest chicken porridge for her and brought it up, asking her to drink a few mouthfuls. She picked up the bowl and felt her chest full and heavy, as if a stone was stuck there. She couldn't eat the porridge no matter what. The vexation that had been unresolved for so many days suddenly resurfaced. She thought to herself that the An fellow hadn't come for three or four days. Why is this person so lovable and yet so hateful? Knowing that she is bored at home alone, why doesn't he come to keep me company? Just as she was silently anxious and longing for him, she suddenly heard the coachman shouting loudly outside, as if he was announcing that Mr. An had arrived. Then there was a sound of leather shoes clattering loudly in the courtyard. Her heart was shaken. She hurriedly wanted to go to the door to welcome him. To know who the visitor is, please see the next chapter.</p>

<h3 id="e130">Financial Gold Bar Price Continues to Decline <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Another Decrease of Five Taels and Six Mace. Yesterday, the gold price initially showed stability but then weakened, with fluctuations throughout the day totaling ten taels. Looking back at the results, it continued to fall by five taels and several mace. Dealers were very pessimistic. Both inflows and outflows varied. Initially, there was a slight increase, but the big players saw that the rise would not materialize and instead witnessed a slight fall. Subsequently, buyers became active, and interest briefly broke through 690 taels. However, with government bonds suspended from trading and a tight money supply, coupled with large-scale selling by major players like Yu Feng, Yong Zhi, Feng Yong, etc., and with the foreign exchange market fluctuating between tight and loose (but the price of British gold remained flat, resulting in a large foreign exchange turnover), the gold market suddenly showed a downturn, falling by more than eight taels. At noon, it seemed to turn upward, but the market lacked activity due to the three foreign exchanges. However, due to the unstable situation, sellers were emboldened, and the market fell back into weakness, ultimately closing at 682-683 taels.</p>
<p>Morning Market Stable but Gradually Unsupportive. From an opening slightly higher by nine mace at 689 taels, the near-term price recently fell by one-sixteenth, while the forward price did not change, and the silver price instead increased by one-eighth. Private telegrams also rose by three-sixteenths, followed by a retreat of one and a half taels to 87 and a half taels. However, Yifeng, Yuanmao, Yonghui, Xiang, Dadecheng, and others continued to buy without delay, and the price jumped by more than four taels. With the US dollar strengthening, Mitsui absorbed 33.1875 yuan for March delivery. Subsequently, Wheat Trading Co. and others absorbed 1.25, reaching 92 taels by 9:30 am. British gold was quoted at .25, and the US dollar added .375, but the domestic market remained firm, so the gold price was not affected. At that time, 91 taels and 3 mace immediately rose to 92 taels and 2 mace. At 9:45 am, selling pressure suddenly intensified, with Zhifeng, Yongheng, and others selling off inventories, and Yu Feng Yong also engaging in speculation by a certain Mr. Wu, etc., causing the price to be unable to withstand the pressure and fall sharply by as much as eight taels. The US dollar bank buying price was .25 to .2125, and subsequently declined further to 84 taels by 10:30 am, with only about one tael of intraday trading. Afterwards, banks bought US dollars again at .3125, and Qian Chang, Xiang Hong, Kang Yong, Zhi Feng, Yong Yong, Mr. Wu, Heng Yu, etc., all repurchased, causing the price to rebound by more than four taels, reaching 88 taels and 6 mace at 11:30 am. In short, people were confused, and selling immediately resulted in a small decline. If there were buyers, the price would rise. By noon closing, it retreated to 86 and a half taels. The price for deliveries was changed to 738 taels, with a discount of 45-46 taels to 50 taels.</p>
<p>Afternoon Subject to Pressure from the Situation. The afternoon market opened at 86 and a half taels, followed by a few mace up and down, from 6 taels and 2 mace to 7 taels. Yuanmao Yong and others came to sell, and the price fell to 4 taels and 9 mace. Suddenly, Tianfeng Yong, Qian Chang, Xiang Fuyu, etc., bought, and the price was raised by more than three taels, reaching 88 taels and 3 mace at 3 pm. However, people were lacking in confidence, especially due to the tense situation. Yuanmao Yong and Yifeng, etc., lamented their helplessness. Dadecheng, Hong Kang, Yong Qian Chang, Xiang, etc., were excited to sell, and the wind and waves resurfaced, plunging five or six taels again. Yu Feng, Yongheng Yu, etc., also resumed selling. By 4:20 pm, it suddenly dropped to 82 taels. From 3 pm to 4 pm, there was only a slight rebound of one tael or so, with a slight increase of several mace to 2 taels and 8 mace, then down slightly to 2 taels and 4 mace. At 4:30 pm closing, it was 82 and a half taels, a further drop of five taels and six mace compared to the previous day, and then pulled up slightly to 3 taels and a half. The highest price of the day was 92 taels and 3 mace, the lowest price was 82 taels, a difference of 10 taels and 2 mace. The early morning price for deliveries was 89 taels, the noon closing was 6 and a half taels, the afternoon price was 6 taels and 8 mace, and the closing price was 2 and a half taels, with a discount of 55-56 taels, a decrease of 5 taels compared to the previous day. The recorded prices were 89 taels to 87 taels, with 89 taels for water compensation, and 85 taels in the afternoon. Due to the lack of alternatives, red bars only increased by 8 taels and 2 mace and 5 li due to the decline.</p>
<p>Trading Volume Remains Small. On the surface, trading was mostly sporadic, except for a few firms with more inflows and outflows. Statistics show that Xingmao Yong, Hongkang Yong, Qianchang Xiang, Shunli, Wanxing, Futaiheng, Yu Da, etc., all bought, and Yifeng bought more than a thousand bars. Heng Yu, Fuyu, Yuantai, Daxing Yong, Hengxing, etc., had complex inflows and outflows. Zhifeng Yong first sold and then bought. Dadecheng, Yu Feng Yong, Yuanheng, and Liangxing all sold. In the afternoon, Yifeng, Yuancheng Yong, Shunli, Futaiheng, Yuantai Fengcheng, and Tongfeng Heng all bought. Yifeng Yong and Qian Chang Xiang Fuyu bought and then sold. Hongkang Yong, Dadecheng, Bingxing, Yu Feng Yong, Zhi Feng Yong, Yuanxing Yong, and others all sold deliveries. Yuanmao Yong initially sold and then bought. Speculator Mr. Wu sold and then bought. The Guangbang bought two thousand and sold one to two hundred bars. The Dalian gang bought five to six hundred and sold two hundred bars.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Foreign Exchange: British Flat, American Loose <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>One US Dollar Equals Three Taels, Zero Mace, Seven Fen, Six Li, Nine Hao, Two Si of Silver.</p>
<p>Yesterday, British silver fell slightly, while American silver rose instead. Market conditions remained flat with no new developments. The United States was in a wait-and-see mode. However, the exchange rate suddenly rose, with the British against the US dollar at 3 yuan, 4 jiao, 1 fen, and 2.5 li, and the US dollar against the British at 3 yuan, 4 jiao, 0 fen, and 8.7 li. As for the HSBC quotation, British gold increased by one-two-five (1.25) to 1 shilling and 11 pence, and the US dollar added .375 to 32.5 yuan, with Hong Kong adding 1.25 to 76 taels and 25%. The domestic market saw British silver flat and American silver loose, due to the exchange rate. Initially flat, then strong, then frustrated, the noon closing turned flat. As a result, British gold did not see glory or disgrace compared to the previous day, and the US dollar rose slightly by 1.25. In the afternoon, because it was Wednesday and there was no market, the gold market was actually affected by the unstable situation and the suspension of government bond auctions, so it tended to be weak. Gold dealers sold American silver for a total of 700,000-800,000 yuan. Banks still had a strong desire to buy, and Bombay also sent a telegram to purchase April contracts for a slight hedge. However, the cash reserve was not thin, so the hedge price was not very calculable. There were few inflows and outflows of British silver, and the market was flat, with the so-called bright and dark markets differing.</p>
<p>The interbank trading range for British Exchange was only 0.0625, with the tightest bank buying price at 1 shilling, 11 pence, 3.125, and the loosest at 1 shilling, 11 pence, 3.75.

Sumitomo Wheat Trading Co. and Sumitomo mutually traded May contracts at 1 shilling, 11 pence, 3.75. The closing price in the early morning was similar.</p>
<p>The interbank trading range for American Exchange was 0.25, with the tightest bank buying price for the near month at 33 yuan, 1.125, and the loosest at 33 yuan, 3.75. The early market quote was 33 yuan, 0.0625 to 1.125, and the buying price was 33 yuan, 1.1875 to 25. Mitsui bought March contracts at 33 yuan, 1.1875, and then sold April contracts at 33 yuan, 1.125.

<h3 id="e132">Silver Prices Diverge Between London and New York <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>According to a telegram from London yesterday, the near-term price of standard silver fell slightly by .0625 to 19 pence and .9375. The forward price did not change and remained at 20 pence.

<h3 id="e133">Discount Rate Soars <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Customs Duty Retention Certificates Trading Suspended</p>
<p>Peak Reaches Seven Mace and Three Fen</p>
<p>Market Overview. Yesterday morning, the market did not show any changes, and the overall trend remained calm. Then, news of the retention of customs duties and salt taxes spread throughout the city. The securities exchange was the first to be affected, and trading was immediately suspended. The financial sector suffered significant losses in the storage of various securities. The banking industry, in particular, suffered a major blow to its ready cash reserves for banknote preparation. Therefore, the banks rushed to the market to collect cash for preparation in the afternoon. Unexpectedly, there were too many monks and not enough gruel, and the supply could not meet the demand. As a result, the discount rate skyrocketed, extending the trading time until 3 pm, more than an hour longer than usual. The price reached a peak of seven mace and three fen, a new and unprecedented change.</p>
<p>Discount Rates. The "foreign" morning discount rate was slightly lower than the previous afternoon by three hao and seven hu, half, at seven qian, one fen, five li, one hao, two hu, half. The market suddenly changed, opening at over seven qian and two fen, with the highest quote reaching seven qian and two fen, and the difference between buying and selling reaching two to three million, making it impossible to close. Fortunately, the Bank of China and the Central Bank maintained the sale of more than two hundred thousand before finally managing to pass. The discount rate suddenly increased by four to five li, reaching seven qian and two fen, a very tense situation. The "silver" discount rate was not as urgent in the morning market, but in the afternoon market, although there was no emergency, it was already more urgent. Banks did not post rates, and the water was added to five or six fen.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market Situation. The Jiangnan small silver dollar was 6 qian, 5 fen, 7 li and a half in both the morning and afternoon markets, with a morning trade of 5,000 jiao and an afternoon trade of 6,000 jiao. The Guangdong small silver dollar was 6 qian, 5 fen, 7 li, 7 hao and a half in the morning market, and also increased by more than two li in the afternoon market, calculated at 6 qian, 6 fen. The morning trade was 125,000 jiao and the afternoon trade was 50,000 jiao. Copper coins remained at 372,000 wen.</p>
<p>Silver and Foreign Currency Inflows and Outflows. "Silver" Yesterday, banks received and settled a large amount, as the securities issue caused problems, so the special amount was large. It is estimated that Chinese and foreign banks received and settled more than 7 million, with Chinese merchants receiving and settling more than 1.8 million in notes, foreign merchants receiving and settling more than 1.3 million in notes, and various goods, foreign exchange taxes, and miscellaneous amounts totaling more than 10 million. Strong and weak entered the warehouse at 800,000 and exited the warehouse at 300,000. The Silver Public Association received and settled more than 4.1 million, the head-of-account amount received and settled more than 370,000, various exchange amounts received and settled more than 900,000, and the amount settled in cash was 400,000 to 500,000. "Foreign currency" The amount of foreign exchange drafts made in the morning market was 1.16 million, and the amount made in the afternoon market was 1.753 million. The morning banknote market was 200,500 and the afternoon market was 40,000. The off-site banknote market was 165,000 in the morning and 185,000 in the afternoon. The bank trading was limited in the morning, only 550,000, and the interbank market in the afternoon was estimated at 2.5 million. The receipts and payments between foreign currency accounts of various banks amounted to more than 1.7 million, the inflow and outflow of banknotes was more than 300,000, the Foreign Currency Public Association received and settled more than 12 million, the foreign currency head-of-account amount received and settled 250,000, and the inflow and outflow of foreign currency loans amounted to 220,000. Small money houses traded 600,000 to 700,000. In short, the market situation was chaotic yesterday afternoon, and the investigation of the amount settled was quite difficult. Inevitably, there were places where it was not thorough.</p>

<p>The Securities Exchange Suspends New Trading, No Market</p>
<p>Silver and Money Industries Meet Yesterday to Discuss Maintenance Methods</p>
<p>Regarding our country's domestic national bonds, ever since the invasion of Northeast China by Japanese troops last year and last month, the situation has been unstable and prices have fallen sharply. Although there have been rallies in the interim, the overall market trend has been deteriorating and declining. Despite repeated efforts to maintain it, it has been difficult to reverse the decline. Moreover, the environment in the bond market has become even worse recently. According to recent newspaper reports, the northern and southern provinces and regions have retained national taxes, and the future of the fund is directly and significantly pressured. The bond fund custodian has been working hard on this rescue and has telegraphed various parties to seek maintenance. It is hoped that the central government and various provinces and regions will be able to take into account the interests of the people and properly address the aftermath, so as not to endanger the future. The Securities Exchange, in view of the unfavorable environmental situation, has announced the suspension of new futures trading for safety reasons. The brokers have decided to suspend trading temporarily, which can properly address and rescue the silver and money industries. The bond market is also very concerned about this and has held a meeting to discuss rescue measures. Therefore, whether or not the Securities Exchange will open for trading today depends on the situation of all parties. According to broker sources, all parties are now very concerned about the issue of fund custody.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Yarn and Cotton Prices Fall in the Morning and Rebound in the Afternoon <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The Overall Trend Remains Soft</p>
<p>The yarn market fell in the morning and rose in the afternoon, with the trend being flat. Due to the instability of the securities market and the volatile political situation, people's confidence is weak, and there are still quite a few new sellers. However, although demand is light, there is very little stock in warehouses, so the bulls are calm and holding tight. However, the overall situation is very bleak.</p>
<p>New Sellers Found in the Cotton Market. The cotton market opened lower in the morning due to flat and weak American cotton prices and poor news. Some were sold off, and each month fell by seven to nine mace to one tael. In the afternoon, retail investors shorted, and each month rose by four, six, nine mace to one tael. The total turnover for the day was 15,500 bales. It was found that Hengyi sold 900 bales, Gengfeng 2,450 bales, Ruida 450 bales, and Changfeng 550 bales. Xincheng bought 950 bales, Yichang 850 bales, and Changji 700 bales. The closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>The Cotton Market Started Flat and then Became Firm, with the Situation Gradually Tightening. It is said that 10,000 dan of this month's cotton was collected by Indian merchants on behalf of Japanese merchants, and the Ningbo gang also purchased a large amount, causing great tension in the market and strengthening people's confidence. However, large short sellers have no intention of taking action because their factories do not need it, and overseas cotton markets are still weak. Although the Indian cotton government is poor and deliveries are lacking, prices are difficult to lower.</p>
<p>Afternoon Hankou Cotton Gang Purchases. Hankou Cotton opened flat in the morning market, and the market was dull. Each fell by five fen to one and a half qian. In the afternoon, there was a lack of sellers in the market, and the Ningbo gang purchased, each month rising by two and a half qian. The total turnover for the day was 53,400 dan. It was found that Jifeng sold 2,300 dan, Changfeng 2,800 dan, Shenchang 1,100 dan, and Yuanda 1,600 dan.

Spot goods were unchanged. British cotton futures rose by two to three points, and spot goods rose by five points. Egyptian cotton spot goods were unchanged.

<p>Shanghai South Yesterday, the western route had few sources, and transactions in urban and rural areas were light. Changxi top japonica rice was reduced by one jiao. The overall trend was more peaceful than the Zha market. The stocks of Su, Tong, Ping, Li, and other goods were not thick, and the shops had limited capacity. At the opening, it was several points lower. The early and late rice arrivals were slightly connected. The Yong and Yue gangs had some transactions. The small-scale trading on this street was the most active, and the price was firm by one jiao. The sales of foreign Dujian rice were generally mediocre, and the market situation was stable.</p>
<p>Xinzha Yesterday, the arrivals from various gangs were about 30 to 40. The river accumulation was still thick, and the market was deserted. Kunshan and Biaoyang japonica rice fell by a small jiao. Changshu japonica rice also fell by a few points, and the subsequent steps were difficult to stabilize. If the trend can be revitalized in the next few days, there is hope for a turnaround. The early morning appetite for Dujian rice was very small, and the price of the slightly higher arrivals remained the same.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Hankou Gang Continues to Handle Spot Xiao Jiao Rice <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market showed a slight improvement, as the local street continued to handle the removal of more than 500 bags of spot Xiao Jiao rice by the Hankou gang. Everyone's confidence has improved. If there is a large batch of removals again today and tomorrow, the market price can be immediately increased. The total market opened with 3,500 bags of Xiao Jiao rice. The high-quality Baisheng Xiao Jiao rice was priced at 9 yuan, 6 jiao and a half, and 6 yuan, 6 jiao. Ordinary Xiao Jiao rice was priced at 9 yuan, 4 jiao and 5 jiao. New futures transactions included Yuanxing selling 1,000 tons of April goods at a price of 4 liang, 9 qian and a half.

<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the futures market in the morning and afternoon, the prices of each month showed a near-term stable and long-term falling trend. The popularity of spot flour led to an increase in confidence in the near-term months, while transactions in the long-term months were very scarce and the market was quiet. In the afternoon, due to the unstable situation and rumors of the suspension of government bond auctions, people were panicked and extremely pessimistic, so the prices of each month fell back again, with differences of four to five fen compared to the previous day. Looking at the future, if a financial panic occurs, the market will change again. As a result, the current month was better than the previous day by two fen, February fell by four fen, March fell by five fen, April fell by three fen, May fell by five fen, and June fell by four fen.</p>

<p>Suspension of Government Bonds... Bulls Sell Off One After Another</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the trend of each month still appeared stable. However, customers from the interior, because the end of the year was approaching, mostly received deliveries, so the transaction was really not prosperous. Until the opening in the afternoon, the current month still appeared stable. The initial period was still stable, and because the government bond was concerned, people were selling in mass action. The sellers moved from 2 onwards but each transaction was going lower and lower. As a result, the current month was down by a small two-centimes and a half as compared to the last. The second month fell by one-centime, the third and fourth months fell by one-centime and seven centimes and a half, the fifth month fell by two-centimes and a half and the sixth month fell by one-centime and seven centimes and a half.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market received a telegram from the production area stating that the current price of Cuban sugar was still 1.15625. The price of New York sugar for March delivery was 1.08, for May delivery it was 1.12, for September delivery it was 1.2, and for December delivery it was 1.28. Compared to the previous telegram, each fell by one to three points. The current and futures prices of Java sugar remained unchanged. Transactions at the local Public Association market were sluggish. Dutch sugar 24-grade raw white sugar fell again, with a transaction price of 9 taels and 5 mace and a half. Fine-ground white sugar was 9 taels and 6 mace and 2.5 fen. 20-grade medium white sugar was 9 taels and 5 mace. Dutch red sugar 8-grade was 8 taels and 3 mace, and 10-grade was 8 taels and 6 mace and a half. The market trend appeared flat. The Taikoo sugar market was relatively firm. B-mark was 12 taels and 2 mace and a half. Newly arrived goods were 12 taels. HX-mark was 11 taels and 7 mace and a half. HM-mark was 11 taels and 4 mace and 7.5 to 4 fen. Although inflows and outflows were sluggish, the trend was still firm. Guohuo Gaoxinqing, a trademark on the dealer's plate, continued to open, with a price of 8 taels to 8 taels and 05 fen. Ordinary goods were 7 taels and 8 mace and a half. The market trend turned slightly flat.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Oil Market: Asphalt Falls and Rises Sharply <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>With Fluctuations of More Than Ten Taels</p>
<p>When asphalt was about to be produced, the high price of old goods led to a sharp drop. The price of Hankou Macheng oil fell from 24 taels to 35 taels and 6 mace. The price of Chongjing oil fell from 38 taels to 16 taels and 8 mace. The price of Zhejiang Lan oil fell from 40 yuan to 22-23 yuan. The price of Neiping Chi oil fell from 45 yuan to 25-26 yuan. The old goods of Jiaxing Benche oil were sold for 50 yuan. When new oil was seen, it was also 40 yuan, and then it fell to 25-26 yuan. The reason was that the candle factories' sales were greatly reduced, and the inventory was not good. After the Mid-Autumn Festival, almost no one cared about it. All the stocks of each trade were greatly scared. The old oil had not been finished before the new oil. The market price had fallen by half and the sales began to start up in various places and the market has gone straight up. The Hankou Chengyou has telegraphed on opening 20 taels and the market price for Chongjing oil is roughly at 20 taels, 07 to 08 mace. The local trades have already sold out their stocks and the market has cut off. The candle companies have stopped work while they wait for the oil. Goods that no one had cared for a month ago have now been swept away and foreign oils such as Wenzhou and Taihe, Taizhou, and Jiangxi oil had at first been ordered but the owners have continuously telegraphed to halt these orders. Today it has turned better but there has been no response to the shipment requests. The price was first only 18 taels on arrival but it has since risen to 23 to 24 taels with the place of production stating that costs could not be covered and no wishes to ship anymore with the market being the opposite of tired. Zhe oils and Neiping have also risen to thirty-four and five yuan, yet no goods can be sold. Lanyou has also risen to twenty-eight and nine yuan with no inventory in Jiangxi while Heben had risen to twenty-six to twenty-seven yuan with high prices making it bad business to deal. Those who did were only in a rush. Yesterday, the China Merchants Bureau shipped about one thousand pieces on each of the ship which has already started landing which will be a temporary solution or else it is unknown how long it may cut off. The lack of resolve of the labour strike at the China Merchants Bureau is bringing a great fright to oil and candlemakers.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the foreign silk market in this city still showed no improvement. Although European and American companies telegraphed about the price of current silk, it was only possible to be certain when an overseas telegrams would provide confirmation. The silk merchants are rushing to sell but European companies continue to suppress them with prices still showing no improvements. Yesterday, a company company took in fifteen packs and thirty-five bags for Huang factories.</p>
<p>P&gt; Tin factories send to Shanghai thirty-five packs.</p>
<p>The Wuwei silk factory sales overseas had fallen by a lot and that sales for the current silk was not possible while working capital went without and were shutting up one after another. Currently, there are only ten or so silk factories working in the place and the amount of silk coming out has lessened. A silk train from Wuxi loaded by Huajin etc had arrived in Shanghai and took thirty-five of their top brand products into the silk repository.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the foreign tea market in the city was trending to tired. The British companies expressed that shillings might be trending to be long which led to a state of observation and a more stringent price talk for the precious tea that had been talked up in the past few days. The entire market was only made up of Tongfu Baochang that bought 88 boxes of high end precious teas and there had been no transactions of the rest of the items such as eyebrow needle tea, pearl teas or Gongxi teas.</p>

<p>The overcoat felt market has been exceptionally quiet and sales prices have been falling. The prices have been a world apart as compared to last year in November with good China rainbow colours overcoats having sold for five taels and a half that are now sold for 4 taels and 7 mace. Xinzongyong's Apricot Village that had sold for five taels and three and a half mace were now lowered to four taels and six mace and Baoshan pictured that had sold for three taels and two mace were now selling for two taels and seven mace and there were still no bulk transactions taking place.</p>

<p>Various types of white coal fines have had exceptionally great sales for these past few days with big customer from way out on the Railway Gang selling from one station to the next and most of the coal ball plants in the district had been strongly buying. Selling prices for the market have continued to climb with a price of $1500 per ton and a sale of 380 tons and very stable pricing as long as each one is $9.25 per 1000 kg for the Hongsaki pieces and the Mack pieces were equally stable.

<p>Feng Yuxiang and Li Jishen Were Also Traveling Together</p>
<p>Zou Lu Discusses Diplomacy, Deeming it Never Possible to Settle Harmoniously</p>
<p>As the President of the Executive Yuan, Sun Fo, expressed his active responsibility, the situation improved slightly. Yesterday morning at 9:45, all the remaining Central Committee members in Shanghai took a train to Beijing together. The travelers included Feng Yuxiang, Sun Fo, Chen Youren, Li Jishen, Chen Mingshu, Wu Tiecheng, Li Wenfan, Ma Chaojun, Ye Gongchuo, and Zeng Zhongming. Deng Jiayan, Liang Hancao, Wen Jiangang, Chen Qun, Chen Jianru, Zhong Tianxin, Tang Yueliang, and Fu Bingchang also accompanied them.</p>
<p>Departure from Shanghai: The Railway Bureau specially prepared two flower-decorated cars and one first-class car attached to the express train for the ministers to ride. The pilot train departed at 9:10. Railway police and the 19th Route Army maintained order both inside and outside the station, with strict precautions. Wu Tiecheng and Chen Mingshu arrived first around 9:00. At 9:20, Sun Fo, along with Feng Yuxiang, Li Wenfan, Li Jishen, and Ye Gongchuo, arrived and boarded the train together. Those who came to see them off included Zhang Zhijiang and Guo Chengen. The train departed at 9:50.</p>
<p>Chen Mingshu's Remarks: Chen Mingshu told reporters upon boarding the train that the diplomatic situation was urgent and the central government lacked leadership. Because Mr. Chiang and Mr. Wang and Mr. Hu were not able to immediately go to Beijing to preside over the major plans, it was decided at the Central Political Council to set up a special committee to deal with the national crisis. However, the establishment of the committee and its organization, etc., must be further considered and decided after arriving in Beijing.</p>
<p>Feng Yuxiang's Remarks: According to Mr. Feng Yuxiang, he was invited to Beijing by Mr. Zhenru to be nominated as one of the members of the special committee. He said that he would do everything in his power to serve the country. The date of going to Hong Kong or Fengtian would be decided after returning to Shanghai in the near future.</p>
<p>Students' Request: Before the train departed, four student representatives from secondary schools in Hangzhou requested to meet with Sun Fo, the President of the Executive Yuan. Wu Tiecheng, the Mayor of Shanghai, and Chen Mingshu, the Vice President, met with them outside the train. The students requested subsidies for travel expenses when petitioning in Fenghua and Hong Kong. As a result, the Mayor of Shanghai agreed to the request for Fenghua and gave them a note to see Secretary-General Yu of the Municipal Government. Regarding the travel expenses for Hong Kong, Vice President Chen instructed the students to send a telegram to him (Chen himself) after he arrived in Beijing, and it would be handled.</p>
<p>Zou Lu's Conversation: Yesterday, a reporter met with Central Committee member Mr. Bi Haibin at his private residence. The conversation was as follows: Reporter (asked): Today (i.e., yesterday morning), all the Central Committee members have returned to Beijing. Is your staying in Shanghai because you will go to Hong Kong? (Answer): It is not yet decided whether I will go. (Asked): In your opinion, will Hu Zhantang be able to respond to the Central Committee's urging to come north this time? (Answer): I'm afraid he will not come. (Asked): Besides deciding on the special committee, was there any other discussion when you attended the meeting at Sun's residence the day before yesterday? (Answer): The issues of finance and diplomacy were also discussed. The meeting lasted a long time. (Asked): Can you tell us about the results of the plan? (Answer): These two issues are of great importance and cannot be released temporarily. They must be publicly announced after the central government makes a decision. As for the general situation: (1) Diplomacy will take a tough approach, neither compromising nor adopting a policy of non-resistance. (2) There are already solutions for finance, but the specific solutions must be temporarily delayed. (Asked): What are your opinions on the issue of provinces intercepting tax revenues, and are there any solutions? (Answer): The interception of tax revenues by the provinces is not a problem. Since the provinces intercept tax revenues and do not remit them, they will be responsible for the military, political, and educational expenses of the province. The central government can maintain itself with the direct tax revenue it receives. (Asked): What are your opinions on the party affairs disputes, and how will they be resolved? (Answer): Now we need to come up with proper solutions for government finance and diplomacy before discussing the party's problems. (Asked): Is it true that the party affairs will be reorganized? (Answer): The previous party was too bureaucratic, so reorganization may be inevitable. At this point, Mr. Zou excused himself because he had another appointment.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Huang Hanliang and Lin Kanghou Resign as Minister and Vice Minister of Finance <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Their Resignations Were Submitted Yesterday</p>
<p>Huang Hanliang, the acting Minister of Finance, had just taken office on New Year's Day and came to Shanghai to plan for military and political expenses. Yesterday, he suddenly submitted his resignation. Lin Kanghou, the Permanent Vice Minister of Finance, had not yet taken office and also requested to withdraw his appointment. It has been learned that the two men's resignations are as follows:</p>
<p>Huang Hanliang's Memorial to the National Government: A memorial stating the reason for requesting permission to resign due to insufficient capacity. I, Hanliang, was ordered to act as the Minister of Finance, and I know that I am mediocre and not fit for the position. However, due to the current national crisis, I am carrying out the government's wishes, fulfilling the duty of a commoner, and reluctantly taking on the arduous task, hoping to remedy the national finances. However, after more than ten days in office, I realized that it would be difficult to achieve any of the plans. The division of national treasury revenue is worrying. With my limited ability, I cannot reverse this trend. If I continue to force myself, I will mislead the overall situation. It is better to give way to someone more capable as soon as possible to reduce guilt. Therefore, I am submitting this memorial to request permission to resign as acting Minister of Finance. I respectfully request your review and approval.</p>
<p>Lin Kanghou's Memorial to the Executive Yuan: A memorial stating the reason for requesting the withdrawal of the appointment due to inability to assist with departmental affairs. I, Kanghou, was ordered to act as the Permanent Vice Minister of Finance. As a citizen, I dared not avoid national affairs. Therefore, in my private capacity, I have been planning departmental affairs with acting Minister Huang and conspiring with the financial community to improve the national financial plan, hoping to contribute my modest efforts. However, I have only felt that my heart is willing but my strength is insufficient, and I have been unable to assist. I should not hold an empty title and obstruct the path of the capable. Therefore, I am submitting this memorial to request the withdrawal of the appointment as acting Permanent Vice Minister of Finance. I humbly request your approval.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Customs 2.5% Surtax National Treasury Bond Fund Custody Committee, the Bankers' Association, the Money Trade Association, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce have issued declarations and telegrams in opposition to the central government's proposed misappropriation of funds. These are recorded separately below:</p>
<h3 id="e152">Fund Custody Committee <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Declaration: The Shanghai Customs 2.5% Surtax National Treasury Bond Fund Custody Committee issued a declaration yesterday stating that since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, it first issued the Shanghai Customs 2.5% Surtax National Treasury Bond and established this committee to be publicly elected by social organizations to be custodian of the principal and interest fund for this bond. Article 5 of the Custody Regulations stipulates that (before the principal and interest of this bond are fully repaid, the scope of its custodianship shall not be changed). Article 8 stipulates that the Shanghai Customs revenue of 2.5% surtax should be notified by the Finance Committee to the collecting agency, which should allocate the full amount collected to the Fund Committee on a daily basis from the designated date. Subsequently, the National Government continued to issue this bond four times: Cigarette Tax National Treasury Bond, Post-Settlement Short-Term Public Bond, 17th Year Financial Short-Term Public Bond, 17th Year Financial Long-Term Public Bond, Second Disaster Relief Public Bond, Disarmament Public Bond, Second Customs Short-Term National Treasury Bond, Post-Settlement Short-Term National Treasury Bond, Compilation of National Treasury Bonds Customs Public Bond, Unified Tax National Treasury Bond, Salt Tax National Treasury Bond, and 20th Year Financial Public Bond, etc., all of which were entrusted to this Committee for custody in accordance with the principles stipulated in the above regulations by the Ministry of Finance of the National Government. This Committee bears the heavy trust of the people and the power granted by the state. We vow to do our best to protect the national credit and the rights of the people. For several years, we have never defaulted. However, recently we heard that the central government has proposed to misappropriate the fund, causing unrest in the market. If this becomes a reality, the bonds will be no different from waste paper. The impact will affect the life and death of people throughout the country. It is the duty of this Committee to do everything possible and adopt various measures to ensure that the regulations of the National Government continue to be effective. We also hope that everyone will work together to make up for our shortcomings. This is a special declaration for your public knowledge.</p>
<p>Telegram to the National Government: To Chairman Lin of the National Government, President Sun of the Executive Yuan, and Vice President Chen: We have recently heard that the government intends to misappropriate the funds of public bonds and treasury bonds, causing panic among the people and shaking the market. Since the establishment of the National Government, financial personnel have repeatedly come up with ways to raise domestic debt to provide financial support. The public bonds and treasury bonds issued over the years have reached more than 900 million yuan. The reason why these bonds can circulate in the market and regulate finance is that the principal and interest have never been defaulted on, thus maintaining the people's trust. If the principal and interest payments are suspended, they will immediately become waste paper. The government's credit will be swept away, and economic panic will arise. The people will suffer the tragedy of national economic bankruptcy, and the government will also lose the financial resources to rescue finance. This policy of killing the chicken to get the egg is extremely harmful to both the country and the people. With the wisdom of the government officials, they should not resort to such a strategy. Moreover, President Sun of the Executive Yuan stated in an interview with reporters on January 5 that he would do his best to maintain credit by paying the principal and interest of various public bonds on schedule to avoid disturbing the financial system. Minister Huang of Finance also stated in his inaugural declaration that the public bond fund should be strictly maintained to ensure financial security and strengthen bond credit. How could they go back on their words so quickly? If there is such a proposal, please resolutely abandon it and make a clear announcement to reassure the people. This Committee bears the heavy trust of the government and the people. In order to maintain the government's credit and protect the people's rights, we must do everything possible and adopt various measures to ensure that the bond regulations remain effective. It is our duty to not remain silent. We offer this loyal advice and hope you will consider it carefully.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Bondholders' Association <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>The National Association of Public Debt Bondholders issued a declaration yesterday stating that in recent years, the state's political expenses have been excessively expanded, and various new taxes have been implemented in succession, which are still not enough to meet its needs. Therefore, public bonds and treasury bonds have been issued several times a year in succession, and the total amount has reached no less than 700 to 800 million yuan. If the subscriptions are not sufficient, they are followed by compulsory distribution and tax collection (this phenomenon existed when the Changguan and goods taxes in various places were not abolished). Therefore, our country's public bonds have a phenomenon that is absolutely different from other countries, that is, the government does not consider the needs of the market and the ability of the people to bear it when issuing them, but only if it is necessary to maintain political expenses, it will not hesitate to order the people to subscribe to all the sources necessary for their livelihood. Therefore, the people's livelihood and bond credit have become interlinked. If credit can be maintained and the principal and interest are repaid annually, the people holding bonds can still receive interest or use it to circulate in the market to support their lives. Otherwise, if the principal and interest are suspended, holding bonds is tantamount to waste paper. These 700 to 800 million yuan of bonds are scattered among the people, which is equivalent to 700 to 800 million yuan of property. Once they lose their effectiveness, it is tantamount to the simultaneous bankruptcy of the people across the country. Over the years, although the government's treasury has been extremely exhausted, it has never defaulted on the repayment of principal and interest on a monthly basis, and it knows the importance of this and dare not quench thirst with poison and seek temporary pleasure. It is unexpected that at the beginning of the cooperation between Ning and Guangdong and the establishment of the new government, there is suddenly a proposal to suspend the payment of principal and interest on all domestic debts. This kind of action is tantamount to announcing the confiscation of the property prepared by the people over the years, destroying the people's livelihood, and destroying the country's credit. On the one hand, it ignores the retention of tax revenue, redundant troops, and wasteful expenses, resulting in the failure of finance, and has no choice but to plunder the sources of the people's livelihood to temporarily subsidize political expenses. This kind of measure only inspires the ambition of tax interceptors and supports the extravagant. The people of the country should rise up and oppose it to the death in order to establish the country's economic position. Based on the above-mentioned purpose, this association has set up an office at Xinyichang Securities No. 5 on the 80th floor of Edward VII Avenue, and is also borrowing a meeting place from the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce to regularly handle bond registration. It is hoped that bondholders across the country will unite and actively participate in jointly maintaining bond credit. This is a special declaration.</p>

<p>Telegram to the National Government: To Chairman Lin of the National Government in Nanjing, President Sun of the Executive Yuan, Vice President Chen, and Minister Huang of Finance: We have recently heard that the government intends to suspend the payment of principal and interest on domestic public bonds, causing turmoil in the business community. The various public bonds and treasury bonds issued by the National Government over the years are large in number, and what is shown to the people is nothing more than a solid fund, strong credit, and repayment of principal and interest in accordance with the regulations, without any defaults. Our people support the country and are willing to buy bonds with their hard-earned money, using them as education funds, charity funds, daily living expenses, or business operations. They rely on the principal and interest of the bonds. Once the fund is shaken, panic will arise, and the impact will be felt throughout the country. You, the pillars of the party and the state, care about the people's livelihood and should not commit suicide and plunge the people into bankruptcy. Moreover, President Huang has repeatedly declared at the beginning of his tenure that he will do his best to maintain the public bond fund, which is related to the country's credit. How could he forget his words? Please make a clear statement to dispel the doubts of the people. Otherwise, in order to maintain national credit, maintain social stability, maintain the livelihood of the common people, and maintain educational institutions, this association will do its best to gather public groups across the country and not hesitate to sacrifice everything and take various measures to be the backers of the Fund Custody Committee to defend ourselves and preserve our lives. Sincerely submitted, please consider carefully. Shanghai Banking Association and Money Trade Association respectfully kowtow.</p>
<p>Telegram to Various Regions: To the chairmen of provincial governments and the banking and money trade associations in various regions: The telegram recently sent to the National Government (see above), etc. We respectfully request your unanimous advocacy to show the country's needs and maintain the people's livelihood. Shanghai Banking Association and Money Trade Association respectfully kowtow.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Municipal Chamber of Commerce <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to the National Government in Nanjing: The political expenses of the government are insufficient, and there is a proposal to suspend the payment of principal and interest on various domestic debts. We are deeply shocked to hear of this measure of drinking poison to quench thirst. Since the National Government's Northern Expedition and unification, domestic debts have been issued over the years to fill political expenses, amounting to no less than 700 to 800 million. If voluntary subscriptions are not enough, compulsory distribution is followed. The people do not have such large amounts of spare funds, but they force themselves to subscribe because it is related to maintaining the party and the country. All the people's hard-earned money has been poured into government bonds. Fortunately, the repayment of principal and interest has been able to maintain credit, so the people treat the bonds they hold the same as field deeds and house contracts, relying on them for their annual savings. Moreover, since bandits and communists have spread everywhere in recent years, people in various provinces who own real estate have been divided and seized. They have no choice but to gather their cash in cities and exchange it for bonds to make a living. Now, if the payment of principal and interest is suspended, all the bonds will be turned into waste paper. It is as if the government has announced the confiscation of the people's property. The people have done their best to protect the party and the country and bought these bonds, but today they get this result. If the people go bankrupt, the government will not be able to survive. In today's situation where sincere cooperation has just been unified, the government should not rectify its discipline to stop the interception of tax revenue and strictly eliminate redundant troops and wasteful expenses. Instead, it abandons the credibility of the government and plunders the sources of the people's livelihood. We are afraid that the people will suspect each other and think that the government's stability is just a manifestation of bullying the few and fearing the strong. Even if the principal and interest are suspended, it will only inspire the ambition of tax interceptors and help the extravagant. How much benefit will it bring to the government's finances? It will only make the commerce and finance bankrupt and follow in the footsteps of Soviet Russia and Germany after the war. The strength of recovery cannot be compared with Russia and Germany. Then our country will truly fall into a state of irrecoverability. What is called danger cannot be ignored. We painfully express our sincere opinions. We humbly request that you, the members of the government, keep in mind that this matter is of great importance and do not make such a bad move. Save a ray of hope for the country. We would be very grateful. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce respectfully kowtows.</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai, a member of the 2.5% Treasury Bond Custody Committee, made a statement yesterday: Today, there is a widespread rumor in the city that the government will suspend the payment of principal and interest on domestic bonds. All sectors of the city are extremely panic-stricken. I was publicly elected by social organizations to be a member of the Fund Custody Committee, and I cannot sit idly by on the major issues related to national credit and people's livelihood. As the saying goes, one should make friends with people of the country with trust, and one should also say that there is death from ancient times, and the people cannot stand without trust. All the public bonds and treasury bonds issued repeatedly are guaranteed by national credit. Now, if the principal and interest are suspended, how will we show our great trust? Looking at the financial community across the country, bonds are used as a guarantee for issuing banknotes. If the principal and interest are not paid, the banknotes will also be affected, and the national finance will be in a state of stagnation. How can the country survive? As a member of the Fund Custody Committee, I dare to take responsibility for expressing that the use of the public bond fund cannot be moved, even if my head is cut off. This is not only related to the protection of the sources of livelihood for social organizations, common people, orphans, and widows, but also to the foundation of the country. Therefore, we will do our best to consolidate it at any cost.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Northwest Test Flight Completed <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Li Jingcong and Others Arrived in Shanghai on Aircraft No. 1 Yesterday</p>
<p>Li Discusses the Circumstances of the Northwest Test Flight</p>
<p>The Eurasia Aviation Corporation previously sent Aircraft Navigation Team Leader Smith, Operations Team Leader Li Jingcong, and pilot Luzi to the Northwest to prepare for a test flight. They have successfully returned. Li and Smith arrived in Beijing from Ping on the 12th and arrived in Shanghai from Beijing at 3:00 PM yesterday, landing at Hongqiao Airport in this city at 4:35 PM. This test flight was longer than that of Lin Bai Ke and could break the Far East aviation record. All employees of the Eurasia Corporation went to the airport to welcome them. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Welcoming Personnel: Yesterday morning, the company received a telegram from Mr. Li in Tokyo, saying that he would take a flight from Beijing to Shanghai at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. After receiving the telegram, the company led all employees to the station to welcome them at 2:00 PM in the afternoon, including Vice Chairman Shuang Qing, German Director Von Sicke, Chinese Director and Director of the Postal Remittance and Savings Bureau Liu Fan, Director of the Postal Bureau Qian Chunqi, Director of the Finance Team Wang Zihan, Secretaries Sun Mutang and Shen Yani, and directors and employees of the Shanghai Station.</p>
<p>Arrival in Shanghai: At 4:35 PM in the afternoon, everyone saw Eurasia Aircraft No. 1 approaching from afar, as small as a dragonfly flying in the clouds and tumbling in the sky. They raised flags and hats to welcome it. Before long, Aircraft No. 1 flew to Hongqiao Airport, circled several times, and landed. There were five people in the aircraft, namely Operations Team Leader Li Jingcong, Aircraft Navigation Team Leader Smith, German Lufthansa representative Huier Tuo, pilot Luzi, and the pilot's assistant. After Li and others got out of the aircraft, they shook hands with the people in the company and were very happy. Miss Shouyong, the daughter of Shuang Qing, presented bouquets of flowers to everyone to celebrate the success of the test flight.</p>
<h3 id="e157">The Success of the Northwest Test Flight (Photo Taken by This Newspaper) <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>From right to left: Miss Shuang Shouyong, Mr. Shuang Qing, Mr. Luzi, Mr. Li Jingcong, Mr. Smith, and a telegraph operator.</p>
<p>Li's Remarks: A reporter from the New Voice News Agency went to Hongqiao Airport yesterday to meet with Mr. Li Jingcong and asked about the course of the test flight in the Northwest. According to him, it was quite detailed and contained many treasures. Li said, "The distance from Beiping to Dihua is more than 4,400 kilometers, which is about 8,000 li in Chinese. We took off from Ping at 7:00 AM on the 22nd of last month, reached Guihua at 10:00 AM, stopped briefly, refueled, and flew again. We arrived at the Ruoshui River at 4:00 PM in the afternoon and stopped in the ancient city. On the morning of the 21st, we flew the plane again. We landed and refueled at the oil storage location at noon, and then stayed in the Ruoshui River. On the morning of the 22nd, we flew to Dihua and arrived there at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. The chairman of Xinjiang Province, Jin Shuren, led personnel from various agencies to welcome us because it was the first time a flight had arrived there.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Ancient City: The reporter also asked about the situation in the Northwest and the scenery of the ancient city. According to Li, the so-called ancient city is next to the Ruoshui River, in front of Heichengzi. The city walls have been buried in the soil and are not easy to identify. Only vaguely, the shape of broken tiles and ruined walls is revealed. The area of the city is about one mile in circumference and was built in the Han Dynasty, reaching more than 2,000 years. There are no people or animals in the city, and there are no aquatic plants or houses. The ground is full of desert and boundless. During the day, the world changes color, and the weather is abnormal.</p>
<p>General Situation in the Northwest: Li also talked about the situation in the Northwest, saying that the weather in the Northwest is very cold. There are heating appliances on the plane during the test flight, and it is even colder at night. The words of the ancients that the Hu land is frozen and the frontier soldiers are miserable can be seen today. At night, the beasts howl. Among these four thousand four hundred kilometers from Ping to Dihua, there are either high mountains or deserts. There are very few rivers. From Baotou to Hami, the border of Xinjiang, there are more than one thousand kilometers, all of which are deserts and there are few traces of people. The rest of the places are also very desolate. Dihua is the capital of Xinjiang Province, but it is not very lively. The more prosperous one is Dachen, which is located in the south of the Tianshan Mountains. There are very few Han Chinese living in the Northwest, and most of them are ethnic groups. There are also many Turkish and Indian merchants.</p>
<p>Formal Flight: The success of this Northwest test flight of the company was unexpected. Before the event, British and German people speculated that it would not be easy to succeed. The company is very pleased with this achievement. It has now ordered four aircraft from Germany to prepare for formal flights. The opening date has not yet been determined and must be decided by the board of directors. It will probably be realized in March of this spring. After that, a flight from Shanghai to Dihua, Xinjiang, will only take two or three days to arrive, which is a world of difference from the previous road travel.</p>
<p>Bringing Back Mail: It is said that the people in the post office said that the Eurasia Aviation Corporation sent Eurasia Aircraft No. 1 to test fly the new route from Beiping to Xinjiang. After arriving safely in Dihua, it started its return journey on the 7th and brought back a small amount of mail. The mail was sent from Dihua Post Office on January 7, and the part sent to Shanghai was transferred to Shanghai by the Beijing-Shanghai night train last night (the 12th). It took only six days on the way, and its speed of transfer created a new record in the history of Chinese transportation.</p>

<p>He Has Not Been To The Office Since Yesterday</p>
<p>Zou Bingwen, the Director of the Unified Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance, previously took office at the repeated urging of Minister Huang Hanliang due to friendship and because Director Xie had resigned, and the office temporarily lacked someone to preside over it. After arriving at the office, he continued to do the usual. Recently, in view of the fact that the central political situation has not yet been established, and the tax revenues of various provinces have been mostly intercepted, making it difficult to reorganize, he has sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance firmly resigning his position and immediately sending someone to replace him. After receiving the telegram, Minister Huang still tried to persuade him to stay, but Zou was determined to leave and has not been to the office since yesterday.</p>

<p>Since the various industries in this city received the Municipal Chamber of Commerce's report on the students' request for a unified strike and urged the government to send troops to resist the case, it is known that a number of trade associations have replied to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, including (1) Candle Industry Association, (2) Dyeing Industry Association, (3) Oil Industry Association, (4) Shanghai Seamen's Association, (5) Rice Grain Industry Association (7) Northern Goods Industry Association (8) Embroidery Industry Association (9) Paper Industry Association (10) Pharmaceutical Industry Association, etc.</p>

Ge Gongzhen, Wang Zhixin, Li Gongpu, Chen Binhe, Bi Xin, Pan Xulun, Zou Taofen, and others have initiated practical measures to assist the Northeast Volunteer Army and issued the following announcement yesterday: The invasion of our Northeast by the violent Japanese is the beginning of the destruction of our country and the extermination of our nation. The military and political authorities are sitting idly by while the national territory is lost and there is no resistance. The Volunteer Army organized by the people of the Northeast are fighting heroically against Japan, and their righteous voice has spread far and wide. However, due to economic difficulties, it may be difficult to sustain. There are now extremely trustworthy comrades from the Northeast coming to Shanghai for assistance. If our people can donate money to support the Northeast combat troops, it will be clear that they can continue to fight hard, so that the violent Japanese will be exhausted and cannot settle in the Northeast. It is an urgent strategy to save our nation. The donated funds have a rapid and appropriate method to be delivered to the front. However, as it is an important matter, all plans are not convenient to be made public for the time being. Comrades are willing to guarantee their personality and sincerely appeal to the compatriots of the country to do their best to donate. Send the funds directly to the Life Weekly Agency for collection and transfer. The agency will issue a formal receipt after receiving the money and then publish the entire contents after a considerable period of time.</p>

<p>Retired Soldiers' Volunteer Army Requests Aid for Heilongjiang The Retired Soldiers' Volunteer Army issued a circular telegram, stating: "To all organizations, groups, and newspapers across the country: Since the Japanese bandits, violating humanity and defying justice, launched an unprovoked war, seized our eastern provinces, and massacred our compatriots, all their atrocities have been evident. Moreover, the Japanese bandits have intensified their actions, launching successive attacks. However, the government authorities have only appealed to the League of Nations and have not resisted at all. Only Ma Zhanshan's isolated army has resisted Japan, fighting bitterly day and night, and has been forced to retreat to the borders of Heilongjiang due to lack of support. Driven by patriotic fervor, the people have been unable to offer assistance. We are determined to dedicate ourselves to the party and the country, and we endorse Mr. Wang Jingwei's national salvation plan, sharing a common hatred and firm resolve. Therefore, we are reorganizing our troops and awaiting orders to aid Heilongjiang, vowing to exert all our strength. If the country perishes, we perish; if the country survives, we survive. Beyond this, we will neither listen nor ask. Respectfully submitted by Wang Kedong (also known as Tie ), commander of the Second Division of the Retired Soldiers' Anti-Japanese National Salvation Volunteer Army, leading all officers and soldiers." It is also reported that Chen Shankun, director of the division's propaganda department, specially dispatched Shi Xinkai, captain of the first team, to lead propagandists to Zhejiang to carry out propaganda, bringing dozens of propaganda items in the hope of awakening the people and preparing for external resistance and internal stability.</p>

Then, Yue Xiaocheng, chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, gave a speech, saying, "Mr. Jiao Yitang, the founder of our association, originally planned to invite you all on New Year's Day, but because you were all on holiday, we changed the date to today to talk with you. Since the September 18th Incident, the Japanese imperialists have been running rampant, arousing the indignation of both gods and men. Now, the Japanese troops are about to reach Tianjin, and the government has no way to deal with it. Therefore, the purpose of establishing our association is to awaken the people with the Three People's Principles and jointly save the country. We will establish branch associations in various provinces, cities, and counties in Shanghai to expand publicity. We hope that you, serving in the press, will do your best to publicize and awaken the people to seek self-defense." Finally, Shang Mujiang and others spoke successively. At about 4 p.m., refreshments were served, and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<h3 id="e169">Another Case of Counterfeit Cotton Yarn Cracked <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Dafeng Cotton Yarn Shop in the French Concession</p>
<p>Forty-Three Bales of Japanese Yarn Seized</p>
<p>Recently, Japanese cotton yarn has been found in the market masquerading as domestic Shenxin Yarn Factory products. After the Shenxin Yarn Factory cracked the case and handed over the suspects and evidence to the First Special District Court for interrogation, the details have been reported in the newspapers. Now, it has been reported that Zheng Kang, the owner of the Dafeng Cotton Yarn Shop at No. 50 Xixin Bridge, French Concession, recently altered the packaging of 42 bales of Japanese Blue Wind brand cotton yarn to masquerade as Shenxin Yarn Factory's products and sell them on the market. After the Shenxin Factory learned of this, it reported the matter to the Public Concession Police, which then requested the French Police to send detective Gu Mingzhou to the Dafeng Yarn Shop to seize 43 bales of counterfeit cotton yarn, along with the shop owner Zheng Kang, and bring them to the police station. Yesterday morning at 10 o'clock, they were handed over to the First Division of the Second Special Court. Judge Ma Shounan ascended the bench to interrogate them. First, the police lawyer Fei Xizhen stated the case, saying that the defendant sold Japanese goods as domestic goods and is now being prosecuted under Article 269 of the Criminal Code for hindering agriculture, industry, and commerce, and requested a continuance for investigation and verification. The plaintiff, Shenxin Yarn Factory, represented by employee Tong Jiarui, filed a complaint, requesting that the law be strictly enforced. When questioned, Zheng Kang confessed that he was a merchant and that the 16-count Ren Zhong brand was indeed affixed to the Blue Wind brand yarn. He stated that he had purchased this cotton yarn three or four months ago and did not dare to counterfeit it. When asked where he purchased it, he replied that he did not remember clearly and hired lawyer Gu Jirong to defend him, requesting that the defendant be allowed to post bail pending the adjourned hearing. The police lawyer objected, and the court did not allow bail. Judge Ma Shounan announced that the hearing would be adjourned to the morning of the 20th and ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody.</p>

<p>Workers of the Japanese-owned Tongxing Yarn Factory at No. 181 Gordon Road, previously angered by the factory's dismissal of a large number of workers, arbitrary oppression, increased workload, and deduction of wages, conspired to deal with the situation. The factory had been preventing workers from entering the factory since the 9th. The workers sent ten representatives to negotiate with the factory at around 2 p.m. yesterday. At that time, about 200 to 300 workers gathered outside the door while waiting for news. The Pudu Road Police, responsible for maintaining order, dispatched many detectives to patrol nearby. However, police officers No. 1 and No. 45 suddenly ordered the workers to disperse and drove them away for some reason, resulting in a conflict between the two sides. As a result, three workers were beaten and injured, and the Japanese police chief was also injured in the head. The workers then dispersed, and the injured workers were sent to the hospital by the police while investigating the cause of the incident for further action.</p>

<p>The Beijing Printing Bureau is Rushing to Print Them</p>
<p>Not Yet Available for Sale in Beijing and Shanghai on New Year's Day</p>
<p>The Directorate General of Posts of the whole country previously instructed the Ministry of Communications to order the postal districts of all provinces to issue commemorative stamps for martyrs on January 1. The Directorate General of Posts also planned to first issue them in Beijing and Shanghai if the Beijing Printing Bureau, which was responsible for printing the stamps, did not send many stamps by the deadline. However, because the printed stamps have not yet been shipped to Shanghai, they have not yet been issued. According to the staff of the bureau, there are six types of martyr stamps, and there are more than fifteen denominations, which are much more complicated than the procedures for designing and printing the Sun Yat-sen commemorative stamps, resulting in a delay in publication. According to a letter from the Beijing Bureau, the martyr stamps are currently being printed urgently, and a batch of printed stamps is scheduled to arrive in early February this year (around the end of the lunar year). If the quantity is not sufficient, they will still be issued first in Beijing and Shanghai.</p>

<p>According to the National News Agency, the National Government Relief Commission for Flood Victims recently received a report from Commissioner Chen Guangzu of the Wuhan District Office stating that the news reported on the 11th that the Fuxin Flour Mill in Hankou was destroyed by fire, burning 20,000 dan of wheat stored by the Relief Commission for Flood Victims and machinery, with a total loss of approximately 300,000 yuan, was a misreporting.

<p>Xiong Xiling, director-general of the Southeast China General Association of the World Red Swastika Society in Shanghai, sent a letter to the water disaster relief associations of various provinces yesterday, requesting the supplementary issuance of relief clothing to the gentry, officials, disaster victims, and scholars in northern Anhui.</p>
<p>He respectfully stated: "This year's floods have been most severe in Jiangsu and Anhui, and the suffering is particularly deep in northern Jiangsu and northern Anhui. Although your association and our Red Swastika Society have been carrying out emergency relief, the severe cold has arrived, and those without clothing are numerous. In the disaster areas of northern Jiangsu, the government has been distributing cotton clothing for disaster relief very widely. The General Swastika Society has also handed over more than 22,000 pieces to our office for forwarding to the area. However, the disaster area in northern Anhui is very large, and although there has been some relief, there are still many who have not received it. What is particularly pitiful is that the families of gentry and officials, as well as scholars, are reluctant to seek help due to concerns about their reputation. Our office has repeatedly received letters and telegrams calling for help, but we are deeply sorry for our lack of strength. We propose that your association, in addition to allocating the required number of cotton clothing for the various counties in northern Anhui, allocate several thousand additional sets and send them directly to the Bengbu Anhui Northern Swastika Society Office for verification and supplementary distribution, so as to benefit all disaster victims. We earnestly hope for this."</p>

<p>Slight Increase Last Month</p>
<p>Smallpox is Quite Prevalent</p>
<p>According to a report from the Health Department of the Public Concession, in December of last year, 59 foreigners died inside and outside the concession, accounting for 18.66 per thousand. 1,494 Chinese died, accounting for 18.2 per thousand. Compared with the usual situation, the mortality rate of the Chinese has slightly increased.</p>
<p>Smallpox was quite prevalent last month. It is estimated that 22 foreigners contracted the disease, with 8 deaths. It is estimated that 46 Chinese reported to have contracted the disease, with 30 deaths. As a result, the Health Department is quite anxious about this. It is estimated that during this month, the department's revaccination team vaccinated a total of 6,657 people, and the various health sub-bureaus vaccinated a total of 4,067 people. All Chinese and Indian patrol officers were vaccinated this month. The number of vaccinations by the patrol team is less than before because most factories and schools have already completed vaccinations, and the timing of this month is also not favored by the Chinese.</p>
<p>The Health Department's rescue team will be merged into the Fire Department's rescue team. The procedures have now been completed. After the two teams are merged, not only can expenses be saved, but also the duplication of agencies in the same bureau can be avoided, so that the public does not know where to turn. From now on, all emergency incidents, whether due to fire, illness, or other accidents, will be handled by the Fire Department's rescue team.</p>

<h3 id="e178">City Public Works Bureau's Collection of Vehicle License Stamp Tax: The Process <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>A letter from the City Public Works Bureau states: "Our bureau is currently re-issuing vehicle licenses for the 21st year. For automobiles, horse-drawn carriages, and privately owned pedicabs, we are collecting stamp tax on each license. Outsiders are unaware of the truth and are vying to inquire. The stamp tax payable on vehicle licenses is stipulated in the central government's Stamp Tax Regulations, and our bureau's collection is simply fulfilling the obligations of the licensing authority. To provide an answer, we are publishing a summary of the process: The matter of affixing stamps to vehicle licenses in this city began in December of the 16th year. At that time, our bureau had just completed the registration, inspection, and issuance of licenses for various vehicles in the city. On December 1st, the Jiangsu Stamp Tax Baoshan County and Shanghai Zhabei District branch sent a letter to our bureau, requesting us to affix stamps on behalf of vehicle owners when they renew their licenses, and promised to pay a handling fee. On December 12th of the same month, the Jiangsu Stamp Tax Shanghai South District branch also made the same request. In June of the following year and in the month of the 19th year, the Jiangsu Shangbao and Special District Stamp Tax Bureau again sent letters requesting assistance. Because our bureau considered that the vehicle licenses in this city were donation licenses, which were different from those elsewhere, we did not respond. This is the past. In the first half of last year, according to reports from Youhua Automobile Company and Tongshunji Automobile Transportation Company, the Shangbao Stamp Tax Bureau detained licenses and vehicles, and arbitrarily imposed fines, causing a lot of disputes and damaging business. After discussions with the Finance and Public Security Bureaus, it was also agreed that the vehicle licenses in this city were donation certificates, and the various vehicle licenses listed in the Stamp Tax Regulations, detailed in Article 1, are intended to refer to personal certificates. The two are of different nature. Affixing stamps to donation licenses would be a form of double taxation. We immediately submitted a report to the Municipal Government, requesting the Ministry of Finance to allow the various vehicle licenses in this city to be exempt from stamps to alleviate the difficulties of businesses. Later, we received a response from the ministry stating, 'Liquor business licenses are also certificates issued by the government for collecting business tax. Over the years, all provinces have complied with the regulations and affixed stamps, which is largely the same as the situation with automobile licenses. There is no double taxation involved. The request for exemption involves changing the regulations and cannot be approved.' Later, the Shangbao Stamp Tax Bureau sent representatives to discuss methods for exempting the stamp tax on vehicle licenses or adding a stamp. Our bureau proposed that large freight vehicles (i.e., hand-pulled carts) and bicycles (mostly used by workers or lower-level employees of government agencies for transportation, hoping to reduce daily transportation costs) should be exempt to show consideration. The Stamp Tax Bureau also agreed. As a result, the Stamp Tax Bureau issued a notice, and our bureau began collecting the tax on behalf of the government when re-issuing vehicle licenses for the 21st year from December 25th of the 20th year. Regarding the tax collected by our bureau, the Shangbao Stamp Tax Bureau, following the precedent of assisting in the promotion of stamp sales, sent a letter instructing us to retain 5% of the handling fee and remit it monthly at 50% of the actual amount. On December 12th of the 20th year, we reported this to the Municipal Government, stating that the handling fee would be fully reported and remitted to the municipal treasury at any time. We then received Directive No. 13046, approving the record. This is the beginning and end of our bureau's collection of stamp tax on vehicle licenses. In summary, our bureau's attitude towards this case and the purpose of our handling are as follows: ㈠ Our bureau initially did not recognize the affixing of stamps to vehicle licenses, so the matter of vehicle license stamps in this city was suspended from the end of the 16th year to the beginning of the 20th year, for a total of four years. ㈡ Our bureau has full responsibility for the management of vehicles in the city. Since the Ministry of Finance could not exempt vehicle licenses from stamps, and the method for affixing stamps to vehicle licenses should be handled by the licensing authority, it is better for our bureau to collect the tax on behalf of the government when issuing licenses to avoid disputes, rather than having the tax bureau directly inspect, reject, and fine. ㈢ Our bureau has made every effort to advocate for exemptions for all vehicle license stamps that can be exempted. The exemption for large freight vehicles and bicycles is an example. ㈣ Regarding the 5% handling fee for collecting stamp tax on vehicle licenses, the original letter from the Shangbao Stamp Tax Bureau stated that it would be used to 'cover the public expenses of office personnel.' However, our bureau believes that this is a handling fee paid by one government agency to another, so we declared to the Municipal Government that we would 'fully report and remit it to the municipal treasury.'"</p>
<h3 id="e179">Anti-Japanese Association's Search of Daqing Cloth Shop Case <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Ge Yun and Others Appeal with the Police Department</p>
<p>Debate Postponed, Re-examination Scheduled</p>
<p>The Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association discovered that Daqing Cloth Shop, a branch opened by Deng Zhonghe at No. 1, Lane 239, Boru Road, was selling "Ten Perfection" brand cloth, which was actually Japanese "Water Moon" brand cloth that had been repackaged. On November 22nd of last year, at 10:00 a.m., the association ordered special inspection team members Ge Yunting, team leader Yang Haichang, inspectors Shi Xinmin and Ju Zongyan to lead four laborers and hire a truck to go to Daqing Shop. They confiscated eleven large packages of "Ten Perfection" brand cloth, valued at 1,760 silver taels. The shop's staff seized the opportunity to report to the Old Gate Police Station, which sent officers to arrest Ge and the other four, and handed them over to the First Special District Court for prosecution on charges of robbery under Article 348 of the Criminal Code. The presiding judge ruled that the charge of robbery could not be sustained and sentenced Ge and the other four to a fine of 20 yuan each for the crime of obstructing freedom under Article 318 of the Criminal Code, with a two-year suspended sentence. However, the police department and Ge and the others were not satisfied and appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court. Yesterday afternoon, the appeal was heard. At 2:00 p.m., the criminal division chief Song Yuan, along with judges Du and Gao, took their seats in the First Criminal Court to hear the case. The police department was represented by lawyer Ru Baoyi, and Ge and the other four were defended by lawyers Chen Tingrui and Yu Hualong. Lawyer Ru began by stating, "Before presenting the grounds for the appeal, my firm would like to state the facts of the case. On November 18th of last year, eight people went to Daqing Shop, took four account books, two packages of cloth, and apprentice Zhang Haiqing onto a truck, and drove them to the Anti-Japanese Association, where they were detained for several hours. Later, his father provided a guarantor for his release, but the guarantee stated that Deng Zhonghe must be handed over within three days, otherwise the guarantor would be held responsible." At this point, lawyer Chen Tingrui objected and requested that the statement be prohibited, saying that what lawyer Ru was saying was irrelevant to the case. Lawyer Ru replied that the matter was causally related to the case and therefore needed to be stated. Judge Song ruled that it could be stated, and Lawyer Ru continued, "On the 22nd, Ge Yunting and the others went to Daqing again and took all of the 'Ten Perfection' brand cloth away. The shop's staff, Li Jiapu, reported to the police, who arrested the defendants and prosecuted them for robbery in the Special Court. At that time, Xu Fangcai, a representative from the Wusong Ten Perfection Factory, came to court to testify that the cloth taken away was produced by their factory and was indeed domestic goods. The original trial did not prosecute for robbery but imposed a fine for obstruction. However, on the night of the day the verdict was issued, Xu Fangcai, who testified in court, was suddenly arrested by more than 40 people, and the Ten Perfection Factory was sealed off. The goods were also taken away. Xu was detained for several days before being released and is now afraid to come to Shanghai and is hiding in Ningbo. The above are all facts. There are only two grounds for appeal: ㈠ Please overturn the inappropriate original judgment and sentence the appellees for the crime of robbery under Article 348; ㈡ The original trial did not mention how the stolen goods were disposed of, which is a serious oversight. Please order that they be returned to Deng Zhonghe." Judge Song then questioned Ge Yunting and the others about the grounds for the appeal. They replied, "We were executing an order from the Standing Committee and were acting purely out of patriotism. We are not satisfied with the original judgment of guilt and are appealing to have the original judgment overturned and declared innocent." He asked, "Where are the goods now?" The answer was, "In the Zhabei storage warehouse." They also said that the Ten Perfection Factory could originally only produce ten bolts of cloth per day, but after the boycott of Japanese goods, without adding any machinery, it could produce 30 bolts per day. After investigation, it was found that the cloth was produced by the Gongda Yarn Factory and rebranded as "Ten Perfection." That is why they went to seize the goods. Then, Deng Zhonghe turned himself in and testified that the cloth was indeed entirely domestic goods. If it could be proven that it was Japanese goods, he and the Ten Perfection Factory were willing to accept any punishment. The appellee's lawyer Chen said that the police department's grounds for appeal were lengthy and had just been handed down in court, so he could not adequately prepare a defense and requested that the court reschedule the hearing. Judge Song granted the request and ordered that the case be heard again at a later date.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Sheng Yulin Accused of Embezzling Large Sums <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Formerly manager of the Sanxin Yarn Factory, now residing at No. 234, Xinxing Lane, Chongming Road, Hongkou, Changzhou native Sheng Yulin, has recently been sued in the First Special District Court by former Sanxin Yarn Factory employees Yu Hesheng, Chen Zhuting, Yu Guoxiang, and others, accusing him of embezzling large sums of money and destroying account books. The reasons for their lawsuit are as follows: In April of the 20th year, when the Sanxin Yarn Factory was sold, the factory owner ordered the defendant to sell all the scrap iron and old materials in the factory, and distribute the proceeds fairly to all colleagues in the factory. However, the defendant did not make the sale procedure public and the allocation of funds was unclear, and much of the money was embezzled. All employees publicly elected Zhu Jiyu and Cai Xin as representatives to request the publication of accounts. The defendant initially refused to hand over the accounts on the grounds that they had no right to request them. Then, they publicly elected the plaintiffs as representatives to petition the Social Affairs Bureau to order the defendant to hand over the account books. The bureau entrusted Guangde Accountants to review the accounts, and it was found that the amounts were inconsistent and that the account books had been destroyed and pages were missing. Other evidence further proves that the defendant's embezzlement is highly suspected. Therefore, the factory employees specially entrusted the plaintiffs to file a lawsuit. The case was heard last month, and both parties were summoned to court. After the plaintiffs stated the reasons for the lawsuit, Sheng Yulin claimed that he had sold the scrap materials this spring and entrusted Sun Hechai to handle the matter. All accounts were recorded by Sun, and Sun also submitted the account books to the Social Affairs Bureau. He himself had never reviewed them. Because Sun Hechai was an important witness in the case, the hearing was postponed until yesterday to summon Sun to court for further questioning. However, the summons could not be delivered, so he was still not present. The plaintiffs submitted an additional statement of reasons, stating that the sale of scrap materials at the Sanxin Factory always followed a bidding system, and the release of goods from the factory always required gate passes with detailed descriptions of the goods. However, the defendant colluded with brokers and privately exchanged goods, and gate passes were filled out by private individuals who had no relationship with the factory. Furthermore, the account statements submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau had many flaws. It was also discovered that the scrap materials were sold for 26,621 yuan, while only 17,717 yuan was distributed to colleagues, leaving a remainder of more than 8,900 yuan embezzled. There was also a revenue of 1,000 yuan for managing flower bags, while only 700 yuan was paid out. The amount was also inconsistent with the second account book submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau, amounting to more than 3,290 yuan in six items. In summary, the embezzlement is factual. Judge Xiao Xiefen asked what evidence they had to support the embezzlement stated in the additional statement of reasons. The plaintiffs gave detailed explanations, but there were too many items to calculate and provide evidence for at once. The plaintiffs' lawyers Gu Hongbiao and You Zhi stated that they requested the court to postpone the case temporarily so that the lawyers could list the reasons and evidence for each item of embezzlement and submit them to the court for review to facilitate the hearing. The court granted the request.</p>

After about half an hour, they each fled with their loot. After a detailed investigation, the losses were found to be 306 yuan in cash, a gold watch chain, a pair of gold earrings, a black sheepskin robe, a leopard skin robe, a woolen overcoat, and two bolts of silk, totaling about 1,000 yuan.

<p>Ningbo Association Holds Meeting to Discuss</p>
<p>The Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Townsmen Association held a meeting yesterday to discuss providing relief for fishermen from Dinghai County who were shipwrecked and drifted to Japan and lacked funds to return home. A special meeting of the Executive Committee was convened, attended by committee members Chen Zhonggao, Chen Liangyu, He Shaoting, Xu Qinxiang, Mao Heyuan, Sun Meitang, Wu Zhifen, Jin Shunqing, Yuan Ludeng, Le Zhenbao, Zhang Jiguang, Mu Zixiang, Ke Zipei, and over twenty others. Chen Liangyu was elected chairman. First, Mr. Dong Xinqin, a staff member of the association, reported that Yu Zichang, a director of the Sanjiang Public Office in Nagasaki, had sent a telegram stating that twenty-two unemployed overseas Chinese from Oujiang had moved from various parts of Kyushu to Nagasaki and were in extreme poverty. There were also sixteen fishermen from Dinghai County who had been shipwrecked and drifted to Japan, and requested 1,000 Japanese yen for relief. In addition to asking the Wenzhou Shanghai Fellow Townsmen Association to find ways to provide relief for the twenty-two overseas Chinese from Oujiang, they asked how to provide assistance to the fishermen from Ningbo. After joint review by the committee members, it was estimated that the cost of returning to China from Japan would be about 450 Japanese yen. It was decided that the money would be remitted to the Bank of China immediately, and a letter would be sent to the Sanjiang Public Office to handle the matter properly.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Japanese Ships in China Plan to Make a Comeback <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Planning to Restore Shipping on Rivers and Sea</p>
<p>Double Tax on Dalian Expected to Be Resolved</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, Japanese ships in China have been hit by the boycott, and dozens of them have stopped operating. However, in areas inhabited by Japanese expatriates, one or two ships still operate empty, as a means of transportation for Japanese people and their activities between countries. Recently, Japanese people have realized that the anti-Japanese sentiment in our country is gradually easing, and their plan to revive shipping has been proceeding at every opportunity. The current active resumption of Japanese ships in China is described in detail below for the reference of those who are concerned about boycotting Japanese goods.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Yangtze River <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>There were originally twenty Japanese ships on the Yangtze River, operating on various ports up and down the Yangtze River. They successively stopped operating in mid-October. Only one Xinyang Maru was left on the upper reaches of the river, and four ships including Yueyang and Nanyang were left on the lower reaches. After the Ruiyang accident, the number of operating ships was reduced to three. For the past four months, all ships have been operating empty, resulting in huge losses. Recently, taking advantage of the fact that anti-Japanese sentiment is not as strong as it was in the previous months, the Japanese began to plan a comeback. They reduced the freight rates for import and export goods between Shanghai and Hankou by 50% across the board, based on the lowest actual amount received. At the same time, they also reduced the fare for passengers traveling up and down the river to Wuhu, Jiujiang, Hankou, and other ports by half. With the secret cooperation of Japanese customs brokers, export goods have suddenly increased as cargo ships and passengers take advantage of the lower prices. Each trip is now crowded with third-class passengers. The Japanese ships that used to travel empty are now suddenly full of cargo and passengers.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Sino-Japanese Route <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>The Sino-Japanese route of the Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK) in this city has a total of four routes, with nine ships operating. This route has always had the best business due to its monopoly. Each month, the passenger ticket revenue alone averages 90,000 to 100,000 yuan. After September, the business was hit by the boycott, and the number of ships was also reduced. In October and November, revenue plummeted due to Chinese people refusing to board their ships, dropping to only 12,000 to 13,000 yuan per month, a decrease of 80% compared to normal times. The NYK planned to further reduce the number of ships to maintain operations. However, starting in December, sales of third-class tickets for passengers traveling from Shanghai to Japan suddenly increased, and operating revenue also suddenly increased. Last month, it increased from more than 10,000 yuan to about 40,000 yuan. The amount of Japanese goods transported has also gradually increased recently, including tung oil and bran.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Dalian <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Dalian Bay has always been a free port with no import tax. Since our country agreed last year that foreign goods imported and transferred to Dalian Bay would be subject to an additional 10% import tax, the Japanese have refused to recognize it. As a result, most of the foreign goods transported to South Manchuria were reloaded at Yingkou, Andong, and other ports to avoid paying the double tax. Dalian's import trade has plummeted as a result. The Japanese have been resisting for a year. Until the end of December, the South Manchuria Railway (SMR) authorities and the Dalian Customs authorities negotiated that if the double tax was not recognized, not only would the Dalian port be affected by its decline, but also the SMR's transportation business would suffer a great loss. The development of Yingkou, Andong and other ports caused them to decide that the Dalian Customs would actually recognize our country's double import tax so that foreign goods reported at the Jianghai Customs could still be transferred directly to Dalian. However, the procedures for recognizing this tax have been telegraphed to Shanghai to consult with the Director-General of Customs, and it is said that a certificate will be used as a mark, which is under negotiation.</p>

<p>National Postal Workers' General Union Headquarters to be Established in Shanghai</p>
<p>The National Postal Workers' Representative Conference continued yesterday at No. 9, Runde Lane, Fusheng Road, Zhabei. However, there were more than a hundred proposals, and it took time to organize them. Therefore, a preparatory meeting was held all day yesterday to organize the proposals submitted by the various review groups as much as possible. Therefore, the agenda for the second formal conference, which was originally scheduled to be held in the afternoon, was slightly changed. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e190">Attending Representatives <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>

<p>The chairmen, Sun Kaiwen (Hebei), Chuan Dewei (Shanghai), and Yu Qixiang (Guangdong), performed the ceremony and then began to organize the proposals submitted by the various review groups. The meeting adjourned after three hours. A meeting was then resumed at 3:00 p.m., and by 7:00 p.m., most of the proposals had been organized. Among the most important proposals were those such as actively proceeding to recover the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, developing postal services in remote areas, state and political economics should prioritize postal service development, postal economics should be absolutely transparent, and so on. Because the remaining proposals still needed to be organized this morning, the preparatory meeting had to be extended by half a day. The second formal conference will be held this afternoon to discuss the various proposals by hand.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Outline of Key Points <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>The conference secretariat issued a second circular yesterday, reporting the outline of the general union organization that was passed by the conference the day before yesterday, stating: "Greetings, the conference held a preparatory meeting on the morning of the 12th to discuss the draft outline of the general union organization. After six hours of careful discussion, each clause was revised, and then it was passed in succession at the first formal meeting held on the afternoon of the same day. Furthermore, the Guangxi representative also arrived in Shanghai on the same day. Currently, there are representatives from as many as sixteen districts, representing four-fifths of all workers. The representatives from each district are full of energy and discuss union affairs for more than twelve hours each day. The future of the conference is very promising, which is probably what our colleagues from afar are pleased to hear. The important points of the general union outline that were passed yesterday (12th) are as follows: ㈠ It is named the National Postal Workers' General Union of the Republic of China. ㈡ The headquarters will be temporarily located in Shanghai. ㈢ The executive committee will consist of eleven members and three alternates, and the supervisory committee will consist of seven members and two alternates. ㈣ Members will pay dues to the general union at a rate of two per thousand of their monthly salary."</p>

<h3 id="e201">Shutdown Tide at Italian Dye Factory <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>Police Interference Causes Misunderstanding</p>
<p>The Factory Files Lawsuit with the Court</p>
<p>After the Italian silk dyeing factory on Jin Shenfu Road announced its closure, all the workers demanded its reopening. The Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau are working to mediate. The factory reported the interference of the police the other day, which caused panic among the workers. The situation at that time was quite serious. The details of the situation are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Police Interference with the Italian Dye Factory: Due to business reasons, after being forced to announce its closure on December 21st, the Dyeing Industry Union Silk Office and the factory manager Kong Rongqing reported to the party and government authorities for handling. The factory was deeply afraid that the workers would cause trouble at the factory, so they reported to the French police to maintain order. The Lujiawan police sent a large number of armed detectives, which caused great panic among the workers and a slight misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Party and Government Advise: Xu Yefu, Deputy Section Chief of the Civil Affairs Section of the Municipal Party Department, dispatched staff member Wu Jiaze. Mai Chaoshu, Director of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, dispatched staff member Qiu Peihao to jointly explain everything to the political department of the French police and requested the withdrawal of the detectives to avoid conflict. The police department completely withdrew the armed detectives in the afternoon. At the same time, the party and government authorities tried to mediate.</p>
<p>Filing a Lawsuit: Kong Rongqing, manager of the Italian Dye Factory, stated that the factory's actions in dealing with the workers this time were out of necessity, not intentionally to dismiss the workers, but the workers did not forgive them and disputes arose. Yesterday, he officially appointed lawyer Bian Jialu to file a lawsuit with the court, demanding compensation from the workers for the losses. This document has been submitted to the court by lawyer Bian Jialu. In addition, the Italian Dye Factory on Xinglong Street and the wholesale office on Gongguanju Road have also stopped operating since yesterday. The factory has requested the French police to send detectives to protect them.</p>
<p>Union Resolutions: The Silk Office of the Dyeing Industry Occupational Union, due to the Italian factory's expulsion of workers and the expansion of the dispute, held a joint meeting of representatives from various factories. Chairman Jin Tai reported on the resolutions of the various cases: 1. How to assist the workers who are being oppressed by force by the Italian factory? It was resolved to unanimously resist to the end and vow not to yield in order to achieve the goal of resuming work. 2. How to deal with the Italian factory owner's expulsion of workers? It was resolved that: (1) Report to the party and government authorities for strict handling and request immediate resumption of work. (2) Each factory will send one representative to question the co-industry association Zhu Wenqi. 3. It was resolved to report Zhang Aida's case of concealment to the authorities for punishment. 4. Omitted. 5. Whether to organize a special committee to handle the Italian dispute for discussion. It was resolved to appoint Ren Xinglin and other nine people to immediately organize a special committee to handle the Italian incident.</p>

<p>Mr. Feng Gave a Sincere Speech</p>
<p>The other day at 6:30 PM, Dr. Luo Yunyan, an old friend of Mr. Feng Yuxiang, hosted a banquet for Mr. Feng at the canteen of the YMCA in the French Concession, and invited more than 30 Western friends and Tang Yueliang to accompany them. During the banquet, Mr. Luo first delivered a welcoming speech, followed by a speech by Mr. Feng, who said that the world is a commonwealth and all mankind are one family. If we want to realize true world peace, we must let justice prevail over might and liberate all nations. Otherwise, the rich will be too rich, the poor will be too poor, the weak will groan without appeal, and the strong will act wantonly. Peace and happiness will never be maintained. Fortunately, you are all from culturally advanced friendly countries. For the sake of the future culture of the world, I hope that everyone will devote themselves to creating a new culture and striving to suppress the strong and support the weak. I am not talented, but I am willing to follow you all. After Mr. Feng finished his speech, he went to the roof garden for a photo. It was already 9:30 PM, and the guests and hosts all dispersed happily.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Three Municipal Committee Members Request Removal of Land Section Chief Wang Shuzhen <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>Yang Xinzheng, Municipal Committee Member of Caohejing, Chen Ya夫, Municipal Committee Member of Pusong District, and Yang Hongjun, Municipal Committee Member of Fahua District, etc., requested Director Jin yesterday to remove the current Wang Shuzhen, Chief of the Fourth Section of the Land Bureau, as soon as possible to appease public anger, because Wang Shuzhen's handling of affairs is perverse and disregards the people's sentiments. The document stated, "Wang Shuzhen, Chief of the Fourth Section, is self-willed and obstinate, and he gained his current position by catering to the former Director Zhu. Relying on the exclusive trust, he repeatedly offered policies that abused the people. Local people have long been resentful and have filed numerous complaints, but the former Director Zhu turned a deaf ear. If he was not deliberately protecting him, he was undoubtedly blinded by Chief Wang. Let's take the more prominent examples: For the issuance of land ownership certificates, which is originally intended to consolidate the people's property rights, the responsibility lies in being swift and efficient. However, when people go to the section to exchange them, they often make things difficult in various ways, saying that the grain quota is inconsistent or that the name is incorrect, and they are rejected and not processed, causing landowners to shrink back. Although the land of each household in development has been developed for a long time, only a few have obtained land ownership certificates. In the past, the transfer and analysis of civil real estate often had mismatched grain quotas and names, which were not unusual. What is the intention of the section in not processing them and nitpicking? Furthermore, there are regulations for issuing land ownership certificates, but there are cases of concealment and fraudulent claims. The section does not investigate carefully. Even after the landowners have provided proof of ownership in many ways, they are still not processed. No wonder public opinion is in an uproar, and everyone believes that land ownership certificates are issued to reorganize the land, but now the issuance of land ownership certificates has led to property rights errors and confusion, which is disappointing to the people. When land is transferred, the parties must go to the bureau together to fill out application forms and other procedures. The section's responsibility is to understand the people's sentiments. Just think, can homeowners avoid spending time and money by running back and forth for a small amount of land price? Without Dong Bao and others present to testify, if there is theft of certificates and illegal sales, can we guarantee that there will be no disputes? In the past, the Shanghai County Government had a proposal to abolish official contracts and distribute them to the industry, but local people believed that it was a harsh government and abuse of the people, so they stopped it immediately. This shows the psychology of the people and the way for politicians to follow. Although the method of transferring and registering land certificates has been approved by the mayor, why does the section insist on making things difficult for the people to the point of being a puppet? Even more seriously, the land prices of each land lot have been assessed and reported long ago, but the section arbitrarily increases them when the people pay taxes, causing widespread confusion and public resentment. After hearing and seeing this, the committee members are uneasy to remain silent. We are deeply pleased that the former Director Zhu has already left office, and Your Excellency's arrival is the beginning of a new era. It is time to change course and start anew. We are determined to base our decisions on public opinion, and we dare to present the situation below, requesting that the section chief be removed as soon as possible to appease public anger and assist in rectification. We are extremely urgent."</p>
<h3 id="e204">Zhabei National Exhibition Fair in Full Swing <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>Grand Opening Tomorrow, Inviting Guests from All Circles</p>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' Promotion of National Goods Association has prepared for the Zhabei Third National Goods Exhibition Fair, and all procedures have been completed. The thatched houses in the venue were built day and night by the Zheng Zhenghe Construction Factory and were completed yesterday. Beautiful and practical, the field affairs section members Xu Jianruo and Chen Binghui personally divided the field location and tried to expand 14 rooms, allowing different factories producing national goods to join the display. Except for the six industries of silk, cloth, wool, cotton, weaving, and cosmetics, which are special circumstances, four companies are allowed to participate. For other industries, at most two companies from each factory are preparing a large number of products, determined to sacrifice special prices and compete to sell first.

<p>Editor,</p>
<p>I recently read in your newspaper on the 11th of this month that I was mistakenly elected as a committee member of the Shanghai Citizens' Patriotic Association while I was not in Shanghai. Since this is a sign of not forgetting those who are far away, I should do my best. However, since I am not in Shanghai, how can I be responsible? If I only occupy an empty position, it will hinder the work. In addition to sending a letter to the association requesting resignation, please publish the letter to declare my responsibility.</p>

<h3 id="e218">The Path That Students Should Take in the Future <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>Reading to save the country.</p>
<p>Become one with the peasants and workers.</p>
<p>A spirit of transcendence. A worldly career. Huang Juemin</p>
<p>Students are the pillars of the country and the pioneers of society. The scholar-official class that stood before them was so corrupt, and the countless masses that stood behind them were so ignorant. Therefore, the country's future depends only on these few young students to release a ray of dawn in the long night. At present, internal and external troubles are pressing heavily, and all those with blood and spirit are united against the enemy, especially the youth. There is a need for guidance at the crossroads. Based on my humble opinion, I would like to offer the path that young people should take in the future to my dear young students. Some say that the country's difficulties have reached a critical moment, so how can there be leisurely words? I do not know that the current situation in our country is like a seven-year illness seeking wormwood for three years. First, recently, the views on students saving the country in our country have been inconsistent. Some say that students should study, some say that students should teach the country, and some say that studying should not forget saving the country, and saving the country should not forget studying. I mean that what is said above is not correct. It must be known that reading to save the country is two aspects of the same event and cannot be separated. Reading is the means, and saving the country is the goal. However, this so-called reading is different from reading to death. In the future, our reading is not a replaying of lectures like a phonograph. We should enter society and seek knowledge in society, striving to ensure that the knowledge gained has a close relationship with society and is used in society to obtain greater gains. We believe that today's China has reached a major turning point. If we want to wash away all the old legacy and seek the survival of the masses and find a way out, then we must strive for the struggle to reform the current social organization, and seek the development of new forces in the struggle. Therefore, the first path that students should take in the future is to read to save the country. Second, today's China is not the country of the masses, but the country of bureaucrats and warlords. How can it be expected to pacify the country internally and resist foreign aggression? Only the peasant and worker masses have the ability to resist the oppression of imperialism. Although young students have the will and enthusiasm to resist imperialism, they themselves lack the power. The only way to achieve their wishes is to awaken the peasant and worker masses and become one with the peasants and workers, and establish a great and lasting force to fight imperialism to the death, and to fight to the death with all traitors who lose power and humiliate the country. Therefore, the second path that students should take in the future is to become one with the peasants and workers. Third, the young students under the rampage of the tyrant can be roughly divided into two major groups: one is determined to sacrifice themselves and fight to the death with the enemy; the other is to prolong their lives and endure death to fill this weak China. The former is commendable for their loyalty, but if they die, they will not bear any responsibility. It seems too easy. Strictly speaking, they dare to say that they have exhausted the duties of youth. Youth is the backbone of the nation, and like white blood cells in the human body, if white blood cells are lacking, diseases will take advantage of it. If the backbone dies, the vitality of the nation will also decrease, causing great losses to the nation. Therefore, young people in the future should know that this is not the time to die, but to actively temper their physique, strengthen their will, not fear difficulties, not live in ease, hold the spirit of certain death, and devote themselves to society, devote themselves to humanity, seek welfare for society, and strive for the survival of humanity. Therefore, the third path that students should dare to take in the future is to do a worldly career with a spirit of transcendence. (Yi)</p>

<h3 id="e220">The Deformed Development of Shanghai Society <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Mian Yi</p>
<p>If we cast our eyes on the general phenomena of Shanghai society today, there is a common morbid state, which is the development of a deformed Shanghai society. In ordinary times, we do not see any special signs, but if we analyze it carefully with a microscope, all the evils in society can be summarized into this deformed development of society, and we can get a definite and irrefutable answer.</p>
<p>We know that no matter what things, there must be equal development in order to gradually seek progress. On the contrary, one thing is a laggard in the times and is degenerating, while at the same time, the same thing is surpassing the times and progressing. This contradictory evolution丨deformed development丨will never have good results, and even to the point of making things so bad that they cannot be cleaned up. Now we take the facts in society to prove:</p>
<p>In the ordinary life of ordinary people in society, no one is satisfied with the current situation and does not want to move towards a more comfortable life. However, the life of the poor still lingers in the hard life of working at sunrise and resting at sunset in ancient times, earning their own food, while at the same time, the rich enjoy the blessed life of hugging charming wives and concubines, living in foreign houses, and riding in cars. This disparity in the lives of the rich and poor is the most obvious phenomenon in society.</p>
<p>The result of this phenomenon is the instability of personal life, because everyone admires and wants to get a more comfortable life than themselves, and is dissatisfied with their current life, so they use various methods to pursue that new comfortable life, and all the evils in society have occurred.</p>
<p>How did this morbidity happen? In simple terms, it is the deformed development of society. The life of various European and American countries is more stable than that of China. They ride in cars, eat big meals, live in foreign houses, dance, decorate, and everything is several times higher than China. This consumption is what Chinese people crave and want to imitate, but what about their production? The era of handicraft industry is over, and the iron industry has reached the last scene with the prelude of the times. Due to the development of science, it has progressed to the mechanical electrical industry. At the same time, our Chinese production is still the handicraft industry of the eighteenth century, and has not yet entered the iron industry of the nineteenth century, let alone the electrical industry of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>Now we can know that the stability of social life in European and American countries is due to the parallel development of production and consumption. The instability of social life in China is due to the deformed development. We only learn the consumption of the twentieth century, but not the production of the twentieth century. How can society not show the precarious instability?</p>

<h3 id="e221">A Scene of Indignation <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>This scene of indignation took place at the Paotaiwan Railway Station.</p>
<p>It was around nine o'clock in the morning, not long after the train had departed, when three or four children scavenging for coal cinders desperately scrambled for the freshly scattered embers in the tracks. Several rickshaws were parked humorously beside the rails, the drivers squatting in front of their vehicles, puffing away at their paper cigarettes.</p>
<p>Several long benches lay scattered about the station, where one or two workers sat idly. In one corner sat a young man dressed in a police uniform, reading the day's newspaper with a stern expression, as if paying attention to a very important piece of news.</p>
<p>He was a student at the Railway Police Training Institute, named Chen Yuming, a young man with a fervent spirit.</p>
<p>Suddenly, as if struck by a significant stimulus, he leaped up, his deeply set eyes emitting a fierce light. The veins on his square forehead pulsed. He let out a howl, "Ah!" and then sat back down, resuming his search in the newspaper.</p>
<p>One or two of the workers glanced at him unconsciously, then continued sitting idly.</p>
<p>He leaped up a second time and frantically tore the newspapers into pieces, making a "Whish! Whish! Whish!" sound. In an instant, the ground, five square feet in size, was covered with dry, brittle scraps of paper.</p>
<p>The children scavenging for coal cinders also stood up, murmuring in soft northern accents to each other. The workers glanced at him again for a moment.</p>
<p>Chen Yuming was a sanguine young man. After Japan forcibly occupied the Northeast, a violent fury surged within him. A crimson flame burned in his heart, and an alarm bell clanged wildly in his mind.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he roared again, as if mad:</p>
<p>"We're doomed! My country!"</p>
<p>He was like a wild horse that had lost its reins, a giant beast that had escaped its cage! He rushed madly into the kitchen of the Railway Police Training Institute, and cruelly and swiftly, he took a gleaming kitchen knife and severed half of the middle finger on his left hand. Blood flowed like an opened faucet, drenching the ground and soaking his clothes.</p>
<p>Thus, the tragic scene came to a close. Chen Yuming lay on the ground, unconscious.</p>
<p>The next day, a certain newspaper carried this news item:</p>
<p>"Chen Yuming, a student at the Railway Training Institute, from Beiping, Hebei, 23 years old, suddenly went to the kitchen yesterday morning around 9:00 a.m., took a kitchen knife, and severed half of the middle finger on his left hand. Blood poured out, and he fainted instantly. It is said that the student is usually very concerned about national affairs and has repeatedly considered joining the army to serve in the Northeast, but gave up due to lack of opportunity. He acted out of indignation. The institute sent the student to the Haibin Hospital for treatment."</p>

<h3 id="e222">Home First-Aid for Small Fires <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Tao Xiaotao</p>
<p>We must always be particularly careful with fire, whether at home, at school, or anywhere else. If we are not careful, we could burn things, or worse, burn down houses and kill people. How terrifying that would be!</p>
<p>When we are sleeping, do not leave candles or kerosene lamps lit by the bed, to avoid accidental danger. We must always be attentive when cooking or burning anything in the house. Do not discard used cigarette butts in vehicles or on the floor. Keep flammable materials to a minimum in the house. Do not let sparks fall on the floor when cooking. These are all things we should know and pay attention to every day. Don't think that dropping a cigarette butt on the floor or having a few things in the house doesn't matter. The recent fire on the Datong Steamer, which killed more than two hundred people, was caused by a cigarette butt.</p>
<p>Now, I will write down how to put out a fire:</p>
<p>When a house catches fire, close all the windows in the house to cut off the air supply and quickly remove flammable materials. This will make it easier to put out the fire, as the air supplies oxygen that fuels the flames. Oxygen can make the fire burn bigger and bigger. Then, observing which side the fire is on, pour a large amount of water from the roof, and the fire will be extinguished easily. Some people panic when their clothes catch fire and try to take them off quickly. But before the clothes can be removed, the fire has already burned the flesh. Some people are even burned to death. When your clothes catch fire, you must immediately lie down on the ground and roll around. The flames will not get oxygen to fuel them, and they will be extinguished. This is a very good method.</p>
<p>If the mosquito net on your bed catches fire, you must quickly press the bedding tightly on the burning part of the net. The fire will not get oxygen to fuel it, and it will be extinguished. Although you sacrifice a bed of blankets, it saves the house and the people inside, which is worthwhile.</p>
<p>These are simple methods for putting out small fires. While fighting the fire, you must also quickly call the fire brigade to prevent the fire from growing bigger and beyond control.</p>

<p>"Science is valuable, but if it cannot be used by the people, it is of no benefit to mankind. The value of learning is certainly great, but if it does not become something the masses can use, it has no great value."</p>
<p>These two thoughts were the driving force behind H.G. Wells, the British authority on literary thought, to completely change direction and become a novelist of idealism. To realize this belief, he devoted himself to writing without rest. This was not just for five or ten years, but continued until his sixty-fourth year, and will continue until he dies. Ah! Great faith and great effort!</p>
<p>He has completed more than a hundred works. Novels, commentaries, histories—he is truly skilled in every genre. But since the publication of his debut work, "Select Conversations with an Uncle," in 1895, especially after the publication of "The Outline of History" in 1920, he has written from a position of peaceful idealism, which undoubtedly marked a new era in the world of modern writing. "The Outline of History" has been translated into various languages and is popular all over the world. He is truly worthy of being called a king of authors.</p>

<p>I have encountered such things several times, but I cannot tell whether they are comedies or tragedies.</p>
<p>○ ○ ○ ○</p>
<p>Once, the protagonist of this comedy or tragedy was an old man with white hair. He was carrying a wonton noodle stand, wandering around Jing'an Temple. At that time, Jing'an Temple was holding a temple fair, and the ladies seeking blessings, wealth, longevity, and children were extremely crowded. Naturally, this was an excellent time to give alms and accumulate merit.</p>
<p>I watched as the old man carried his wonton noodle stand, jostling through the crowd, his trembling hands knocking on the bamboo clapper at one end of the stand, making a sorrowful "cry." Suddenly, the old man and his stand fell together. Both the stand and the old man cried out in pain. The bowls were smashed, and the wontons fell to the ground. Then, the old man began to wail loudly, picking up a banana peel from the ground.</p>
<p>"This stand is my lifeblood! Damn it, these useless feet! They had to step on this banana peel! All my capital is gone! What am I going to do? Heaven, my bitter fate..."</p>
<p>As he cried, he lamented. Old tears streamed down, dripping little by little onto the dust. The broken bowls and scattered wontons on the ground seemed to let out heavy sighs. "People" are, after all, cooperative and sympathetic creatures, and this was the best time to give alms and accumulate merit. The sorrowful cries touched the hearts of the pious men and women, and so one or two coins were thrown into the old man's hand, because they knew that it was not only saving this poor old life but also accumulating "good for good" blessings for themselves.</p>
<p>The old man, facing this group of charitable men and women, repeatedly thanked them while gathering up the scattered wonton stand. In his tearful eyes, a triumphant smile was revealed.</p>
<p>○ ○ ○ ○</p>
<p>The other incidents were exactly the same, but with different protagonists. Some people say that this is a trick to get money. Shanghai is a world full of wonders. However, I think, is it not a tragedy that an old man with white hair relies on this trick to eke out a living?</p>

<p>X The Conflict Between British and American Consuls</p>
<p>The British were the first to establish a concession in Shanghai. Naturally, they wanted to monopolize the concession, especially the British Consul, Balfour, who was adamant and did not allow the people of any other country to set foot in the concession.</p>
<p>After the signing of the Sino-American and Sino-French trade treaties, merchants from the United States and France cited the most-favored-nation clause and demanded that merchants from both countries enjoy the same rights as the British in the concession. This led to a conflict within the concession among the imperialists themselves.</p>
<p>The first U.S. Consul stationed in Shanghai, Wolcott (H.G.Wo;cptt), first established a consulate in the concession and raised the American flag. The British Consul and the Daotai of Songjiang and Taicang opposed this, arguing that only the British flag could be flown within the concession. However, U.S. Consul Wolcott insisted on his position. As a result, he was allowed to fly the American flag. At that time, the British Consulate in Shanghai was still located in the city and had not yet moved into the concession. Only the American flag was flying in the concession. When British Consul Balfour opposed the American flag being raised, the Governor of Hong Kong did not think so. In a telegram from the Governor of Hong Kong to Balfour, he said: "It is doubtful whether British officials have the right to interfere with the raising of a flag by officials from other countries." It can be seen that the reason why the British Consul in Shanghai did not have a major conflict with the American Consul this time was entirely because the Governor of Hong Kong did not agree with Balfour's position.</p>
