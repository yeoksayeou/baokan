<h3 id="c1">對於英政府製定印度民族分選制之感想　梓· <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>倫敦政府十六日製定印度民族分選制之消息。見於昨日各報之路透社電訊。國人方身陷於空前國難中。對此項外事電訊。能予以若何之注意殊未易斷言。惟吾同洲大國三年來由黑暗向光明掙扎之經歷。與其今日之遭際。足以使吾爲國難而掙扎之國人。受到若干之敎訓。則似未可否定也。</p>
<p>印度問題數年來之能爲舉世所矚目者。以其爲一百八十萬方哩中大多數人類求解放之活動也。回憶兩年以前。印度洋畔。孟加拉灣。中高掦「印度完全獨立」之聲。至以三萬人之投獄。爲其决心之表示。世界弱小民族。望而掦眉吐氣。乃未幾而内部印回之衝突日烈。使整個求解放運動。不免减低其力量。英印圓桌會議之必無善果。固早爲識者所豫知。及今日乃須勞麥唐納之神。爲定「處理印度民族問題辦法。」吾人縱使對於國外事件。不能發生同情之心理。而回視正在爲國難而掙扎之自身。其能免於慨然興嘆乎。</p>
<p>英印問題癥結之所在。爲英僅許印度於英人給予之憲法中求自治。印度則要求完全之獨立。今英政府之民族分選辦法。如麥唐納聲明書所言。爲解除憲法發展障礙之辦法。爲謀使新憲法實施之第一步工作。固仍祇就憲法範圍求辦法也。憶杜威論思想。曾述蜜蜂認就玻窗光線可得出路。幾次向光飛行。終於頭觸玻窗。暈落地上之事。以明思想能力較低者之無辦法。印度民族是否接受此民族分選制。以自儕於暈落地上終於不得出路之蜜蜂。吾人尙未能知。而吾人固亦在不同之地位。眼望光線。尋求出路者也。念來日之大難。不暇爲印度悲矣</p>
<p>所謂民族分選制之具體辦法。吾人尙未能詳悉。路透社電訊所述者。祇各省印回敎徒議席多寡之瑣碎新聞。未可據以評論其制之若何。惟英相麥唐納聲明書中。一則曰「印度各民族屢欲自謀解决。終不能彼此獲一恊定。」再則曰「印人須自知彼等自已一再失敗。未能提出具體辦法······。」一似印度之統治。非借重於英人不可。而今日之事。應對英人致其感謝之意者。吾人不知身處獄中之甘地。能代表印度民族有所聲明否也。</p>

<p>▲陜西只缺了一些水</p>
<p>大雨乍晴、涼風不斷的吹來、我們感覺上所得到的痛快、增加了我們不少前進的精神、十一的那天下午五時、大家都急急忙忙的將行李整理就緒、交給隴海路招等當局令脚夫搬上火車、彼此喧閙半小時、便分乘洋車連珠似直上車站、</p>
<p>慚愧、—我們眞非常的慚愧、因爲我們無形中已是稍稍染上了貴族的色彩和帝國主義的氣槪了、我們當到着車站的當兒、已有很多的人們、持着寫滿了各項標語的旗幟、來歡送我們、我上了火車之後、知道這是隴海路爲我們特别預備的專車、裝飾布置、都是非常美麗舒適、六時一刻火車開行之後、我們於當晚七時四十七分到汜水、十時二十一分到洛陽、十一時四十三分到新安、夜半一時四十分到澠池、二時三十七分到觀音堂、四時三十六分到陜州、十二日天明五時四十六分到靈　、九時四十七分到潼關、一路行來、各站都有服裝異常整潔的武裝同志、向着我們行敬禮、大吹大擂、向着我們大奏軍樂、我細察我們所遇的、好像那時國聯調查團在中國各處觀察時所有之神氣、不相上下、我們的方寸、因此不得不起了深刻的内疚了、</p>
<p>火車離鄭西向疾進的時候经雖然正是暮雲陰黯、夜色漸漸向着大地的四周包圍起來、但是大家還是興高彩烈的向窗外觀看着風景、不過同一風景、各人的觀察、是各自不同、譬如車行時、大家看見了車外嶄然獨立高下不同的黃土斷片、沈逸千君是美術家、便贊賞牠的風景幽特、大有一寫生的價値、劉仲和君是土壤學家、便注意到牠的土的成分、認爲是很膏腴的、其餘的也有拿出唐詩古本、實地考證歷史上的遺跡的、可見同一對象、各人因之所發生的感想、研究和未來的影響、也必不同、</p>
<p>自鄭以西至潼關、古蹟的繁多、令不不勝紀述鐵爐站的北二十二里有周苛冢、爲漢御史大夫周苛與紀信同守滎陽、城破爲項羽所執、不屈而死、滎陽站南三十里的古城、爲鄭莊公封督段之地、汜水站東南二里的汜水縣、爲　之虎牢、於古代史上很有地位、黑石關南十餘里、爲宋代諸帝后陵寢、站東八里相傅爲趙晋墓、距站九里爲寇萊公墓、站南十二里爲包拯墓、偃師站的站南道旁、有伯夷叔齊墓、站西五里有伊尹墓、義井舖站的北十餘里西有漢唐諸帝陵寢、洛陽爲周漢等朝故都、城西南有周公廟、在白馬寺附近有狄梁公墓、東南四十里有范文正公墓、及邵康節祠、二程先行祠及關公墓等、此外澠池爲古兵家用兵最多的地方、靈賓城西南有關龍逢墓、其南有老　西渡的函谷關、潼關西跨象山、東南跨麒麟山、形勢雄偉、尤多古蹟、我們這次西行的目的、不是研究古物、是要實地以科學的方法、考察陜西的實業、故只述其大要、</p>
<p>十二日晨九時左右、我們尙未到潼關、陜西省政府已派徐代表等上車、分運我們至已預備了十餘輛長途汽車、分運我們至西安、我們於上午十時半左右、從潼關、由南路主任胡庶華、副主任趙國賓、醫生葉景荀、幹事蕭馨五徐鴻齡、北路主任胡博捐淵、副主任馬進、劉澄厚、醫生秦恩富、幹事歐釗邦、余仲剛、廖正秒等、各偕全體團員出坐汽車出發、此行共約六小時、據云長約二百上十里、汽車道全係泥路、駛行後二小時中塵土滾滾、車中對坐、彼此無從辦認面目、人坐車内、如在大海波濤洶湧中、顚簸跳躍、很是利害、入後較好、過渭南後、因滿身塵土、十分難受、我們紛紛命車夫停車道旁、入華淸池就浴、池有三、二大一小、我們於濯足之時、默吟「天寒賜浴華淸、始是新承恩澤」之句、不禁爲之悠然以恩、六時左右、我們始駛抵西安、南組住長安公寓、北組住西北飯店、預定行程、擬於十五日實行自西安出發考察、</p>
<p>我們於潼西道中、唯見兩旁黃土滿目、生物稀少、因水量之缺乏、致田中產物、大受影響、陜西膏腴之地、只缺一些水、幾致年來赤地千里、民不聊生、以後如有人欲求陜西農業的猛進、第一步便不可不從灌田方面努力着想、（待續）</p>

<p>（乙）民衆體育吾圖體育雖提倡多年迄未普及、成人之有體育興趣及相當技能者、尙屬廖寥、以各處偏僻之城鎭爲尤甚、故欲提倡民衆體育、一方宜從兒童入手、宜在城鎭𨻶地多設小規模之兒童游戯塲、一方在此塲上附設民衆有興趣之體育設備、如石鎖刀劍等、</p>
<h3 id="c97">（四）提倡及獎勵各種體衣之集會 <a href="#c97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>及組織我國社會上私人組合之體育組織如全國體育恊進會、華北體育聯合會以及各大城之恊進會聯合會等均有悠久之歷史與相當之成續、至於其他零星之比賽及運動會更風彌一時、關於各種觀摩技術之體育會及研究體育學術之研究會、爲數雖少然亦漸有蓬勃之勢、政府對於此數種之組織、一方面不應放葉其督察之權以提高其標準、一方面不能不予以相當之鼓舞以力求其普遍於民間、故政府須嚴定保種體育集會及組織之標準及管理方法、同時應對於辦理有成續者予以相當之援助、並對於無此種組織之區域設法啟發之、茲特規定草案如下、</p>
<p>一·各種運動聯合會之組織無論爲臨時的或固定的、均須具以下之標準於主管敎育機關備案、</p>
<p>（一）目的純正及純爲業餘性質者、</p>

<p>二·上項備案之團體繼續辦理三年經主管敎育機關審查認爲有相當之成續、得予以精神及物質上之援助、如備案後遇有違背上項之規定者、得設法取締之、取締方法視情節之輕重分别辦理之、</p>
<p>三·各種觀摩技術之團體須具以下資格在主管敎育機關備案、</p>
<p>（一）會員均有正當職業而非以運動爲職業者、</p>
<p>（二）有體育專家擔任指導者、</p>
<p>（三）加入各種比賽或運動、不以門票收入爲維持費及分攤於會員者、</p>
<p>（四）會員人會只有納費之義務、而無物質權利之享受者、</p>

<p>（五）體育之考成方法體育之考成與運動會有相反之地位、運動會考個人之成續、祗足以促個人成續之進步、以之爲評判學校與民衆整個體育之標準、實是錯誤、卽以之爲提倡之工具、以期學校與民衆體育之普及猶爲緣木求魚、反之體育考成、所以考查學校或城市全城市民衆之體育成續、可以督促多數民衆體育之進步、以之爲品定學校或城市體育之手段、十分可靠、</p>
<p>甲、考成委員會按行政之組織可分爲國省縣三種、</p>
<p>一·全國體育考成委員會由敎育部體育委員會聘請國内體育專家組織之、</p>

<p>▲前日下午提出書面抗議</p>
<p>▲吳市長允待考慮後答復</p>
<p>本埠自血魂除奸團等活動以來、經營日貨之奸商、類皆銷聲匿跡、紛紛向日方要求退貨、以致日商對華貿易大受打擊、據日本各路商聯會調查結果、謂在最近一個月中、因血魂除奸團等活動、而所受營業上之間接與直接損失、僅上海一埠、已達百萬元左右、故曾迭派代表、向駐滬總領村井請願、要求向我市府當局、提出抗議、同時並致電東京外務省、請向我外部直接提出交涉、日外務省遂於本月十三日、電令駐滬總領村井、迅即遵照僑民意旨、向我市府、提出切實制止之抗議、日領村井奉令後、當即擬定抗議書、谥前日（十七）下午四時半、偕同副領事白井、赴楓林橋市政府、面向吳市長提出、當由吳市長親自延見、據日村井當塲表示、上海市商會、於最近通電全國各業團體、拒購日貨、影響於日本整個對華貿易、殊非淺鮮、加以血魂除奸團等之活動、益足使中日兩國民衆、發生惡感、故特向貴市長提出抗議、請求妥爲制止、以增兩國邦交云云、惟吳市長當時並未有確切之表示、但允於加以考慮後、再行答覆、雙方晤談至五時三刻始散、</p>
<p>▲吳市長談新聲社記者詢據吳市長表示、略謂、日總領事村井倉松、昨日來府抗議本市抵貨運動、本人當時曾答以如有越規違法行動、市府自當依法取締、若在民衆運動合理範圍内、市府亦未便取締、惟正式答復、現尙在考慮之中、至於國人愛國、總須自動激於良心、而爲有秩序之行動、萬勿激於情感、徒尙空言、致引起其他問題、而使政府當局爲難云云、</p>
<p>▲日副領談時聞社記者、自得悉日方對於我民衆之愛國運動、已向市府提出書面抗議之消息後、即於昨日下午三時、驅車至日總領署、探詢一切、當由副領事白井出而延見、記者遂即與作下列談話、記者（問）、昨日（即前日）貴領事曾赴市政府、向吳市長提出抗議、要求制止血魂除奸團等之活動、其抗議書之内容、可得聞乎、白井（答）、昨日向貴國上海市政府提出之書面抗議、其範圍係爲要求妥爲制止血魂除奸團之活動、同時對於貴國上海市商會所發與各業拒購日貨之通電、亦曾附帶要求貴國當局、予以勸阻、因上海市商會此項通電、不啻係敝國對於貴國貿易上之一致命棒也、（問）敝國吳市長、當時曾否有切實之徐覆、（答）並未有確切之答覆、但允於在短期間内、待考慮後、再行以書面答覆、（問）日前上海貴國某報紙上、曾載有敝方駐於閘北八字橋之警察、潛逃八十餘名之誣衊消息、此事早經敝國上海市政府、向貴領署提出交涉、除要求予以切實之更正外、同時並要求嗣後不得再有此項事件之發生、此事在貴領署方面、是否已通知該報館照辦、（答）此事可謂已告解决、因敝領署於接到貴方之抗議後、曾立即通知該報館、遵照貴方市府方面意旨辦理矣、（問）貴國駐滬之海軍陸戰隊、曾一再武裝越界示威、敝國上海市政府、業已向貴領署提出抗議、惟迄今尙未接得貴領署確切之答覆、此事究將如何辦理、可否見告、（答）此案敝領署尙在詳盡調查中、惟貴方向敝領署提出之抗議、謂敝國陸戰隊越界示威、有五次之多、似乎不確、蓋敝國陸戰隊奉令調防、出八於北四川路一帶之越界築路範圍内、事屬有之、但如須經過貴方境界者、則事前必先正式通知貴方之公安局、以免誤會、故貴國上海市政府向敝領署所提之抗議、即使係事實、亦不得謂之越界示威、因敝國陸戰隊司令部、事前曾有通知遞送與貴方之公安局也、至於貴國今日報紙所載敝國陸戰隊又在中山路示威一節、此事完全非事實、蓋敝國駐滬陸戰隊一隊、日前曾奉有杉坂司令之命令、開赴中山路豐田紗廠、與駐在該廠之兵士、互相交替、以致貴國人民、又誤會謂係越界示威、即按諸五月二十三日、中日雙方所簽訂之停戰和約上、亦曾載有「日兵如欲前往中山路豐田紗廠時、可以通過華界」之一條、故今日貴國報紙所載各節、顯係謠傅云、</p>

<p>▲中智通商條約下月開始商訂</p>
<p>中智商訂友好通商新約、近聞不久將開始交涉、惟新聲社記者、以智利新政府成立未久、在中智兩國未正式開始進行此項交涉之前、承認實爲其先决問題、因於昨日往訪駐華智利代辦斐釆賴氏於智利公使館、茲將該代辦所談各節、分誌於次、</p>
<p>▲承認智利政府據智利駐華代辦兼總領事斐釆賴氏談、智利經一度革命、已樹立一健全之新政府、渠於上月八日、奉到新政府訓今後、即照會外交部、要求承認、同月十六日渠接到我國外交部長羅文幹氏之復照、正式承認智利新政府、并表示中智兩國繼續以前友好精神、從事增進兩國邦交、渠立即電達本國政府報告、智利全國上下、對此均極表示感謝、</p>
<p>▲商訂兩國商約斐釆賴氏云、中智商訂通商友好條約之議、約起於一九二九年、在智京聖地亞奇（Santiago）由中國駐智張代辦與智政府接洽、其後未及正式交涉、而張代辦調任瑞士離智、嗣本人奉命於去年夏季使華、該項交涉、遂移華辦理、上次當郭泰祺次長在滬時、本人曾與之數度接洽、郭氏乃令情報司長張似　旭代表進行研究、最近本人於奉到智新政府訓令後、即照會外交部請求定期作正式之交涉、嗣又因行政院汪院長之辭職而停滯、現此事旣已有解决之望、想外部擇定相當日期後、即可開始交涉、據觀察大約於九月間、可望有開始之可能、</p>
<p>▲兩國僑民友善該代表辦復憶及本人初次到華時、所語新聲社記者之言云、智利旅居中國之僑民、計一百至二百名之衆、大都居中國南部名省、華僑之旅智者、大都散居於智利北部各省、人數約在兩千左右、兩國僑民之在中智者、均與當地人民相友善、華僑亦頗定有、智政府對彼等之待遇、無異於其本國人民云、</p>
<p>▲智使署將遷移智利公使署兼領署駐滬辦事處、現設於善鐘路一三一號塞瓦愛大厦五十四號、近來該代辦以該處不敷應用、已决定於下星期三、移至海格路四百號新址辦公、</p>

<p>▲政府之救濟財部徇各絲商之請求、鑒於上海方面各廠存絲甚多、均係上年陳貨、每件廠絲、成本須在八九百兩、至千兩之譜、照現時市價、每件須虧損四五百兩、政府爲救濟絲業計、財部令江海關、凡華絲出口、應徴統稅、與出口稅、自本月分起、實行免收、工商部設立之救濟絲業處、更爲獎勵華絲出口計、凡屬運赴歐美各國華絲、每件除免稅外、更補助銀一百兩、此兩事實行以來、絲商受惠至大、售出湖絲一件、可以减輕損失一百五六十兩、</p>
<p>▲七百件運美華絲運美、停頓已將一年、邇來漸見活動、本埠各絲廠、連日由美商購買黃白廠絲一千餘件、今日開始裝運大來洋行麥金蘭總統號輪、裝赴美國紐約、計七百數十件、該項出口絲、昨日業已報關、定今晨在浦江内駁載上船、此爲停阻一年華絲出口之第一批、而取得免稅、與政府補助貼費之利益者也、</p>
<p>▲人造絲囤積人造絲一項、年來進口甚夥、國產絲大受影響、自經海關增稅後、人造絲進口稅、須値百抽五十、本月四日、財部宣布新稅則後、人造絲進口稅、又增加三十分、共計値百徴八十、再加附加稅一成四、總計人造絲進口稅額、抽收百分之九十四、因進口稅之激增、滬上經售人造絲之意國各商行、紛紛電致本國停止定貨、而已經運來之貨物、各代理各洋行、亦不願塡付此巨額稅銀、紛將大批人造絲移存海關棧房、連日海關第四第八兩關棧、均堆滿外來人造絲矣、本埠經售各行、自八月四日以後、以改變辦法、凡有購辦此貨者、成交若干件、臨時向海關報提若干件、如是則可免預付巨稅、但將此外國人造絲之進口、因江海關之存積、將無大批運來矣、</p>

<p>寗波人董仁寳、三十八歲、向爲成衣匠、兼充報販、與其繼室廣東香山婦人陳氏、賃居梅白格路一百七十至七十二號門牌萬壽長棺材店後樓、董之髮妻、逝已八年、</p>
<p>遺一子根福現祇十三齡、四年之前、董始聚陳氏爲繼室、其時該氏年方花信、成婚一載產一女、愛若掌珠、而對董前妻所生之子、則視同眼中釘、食不予飽、衣不予暖、雖閔子蘆衣、而根福猶不可得、無知幼孩、難受凍餒之苦、故每見阿爺、</p>
<p>輙牽裾哭泣詎董仁寳懼内異常、一聞河東獅吼、無不唯命是從、徒知博床頭人之歡心、竟委棄親生子於不顧、任令凌虐、孩每飯旣不獲一飽、遂私取物件、變錢購買食品充饑、乃此長舌婦則乘𨻶進讒、指根福偷竊、逼其夫施用殘酷方法、嚴加管束、董仁寳遂以極</p>
<p>粗鐵鍊一條將子鎖禁於該棺材店内之擱樓上、日僅給糙飯兩盂、苟延生命而已、左右隣居、咸知此事、祇以畏陳氏之兇橫、故皆抱各人自掃門前雪之態度、不敢出而一鳴不平、加以援手、致根福被錮至今、已屆兩載、茲忽有人仗義執言、</p>
<p>將黑幕舉發前日該管新閘捕房、特派華探目丁華國·探員張根弟·協同西探目愛文思、馳往該棺材店、將董及陳氏拿獲、旋登擱樓、則見根福蜷伏黑隅、曳之不起、燭之方知左股被練</p>

<p>論財產，胡立夫是有產階級，惲蕙芳是一個窮小子··論年齡，胡立夫已過了五十知非的時代，惲蕙芳還是血氣未定的靑年··論經歷，胡立夫在軍界商界中都有相當的成續，惲蕙芳是初出茅廬，還談不到是起家立業，論名字，立夫兩個字，何等自負？大有懦夫有立志的意思，蕙芳兩個字，好似女子模樣，和立夫的意義大不相同。件件般般，都是立夫優於蕙芳，所差異的，一個是賣國，一個是愛國，所以，提起惲蕙芳，如入芝蘭之室，提起胡立夫，如入鮑魚之肆。</p>
<p>同胞們，可以醒悟了！賣國生活，端的不是生意經··財產多也没用，年齡大也没用，經歷演也没用，名字好也没用，事實告訴我，社會制裁的權力，非常偉大；人人都要把惲蕙芳捧上三十三天，人人都要把胡立夫降下十八層地獄。</p>
<p>社會制裁，是專論人格，不論身分的：何况胡立夫僅僅是個有產階級，便是做了貴官也没用。但看，赫赫炎炎的當國太師秦檜，遺臭萬年；芝蔴菉豆的殿前小校施全，流芳千古！同胞們，可以醒悟了！</p>

<p>古來以相貎見稱於歷史者。未必皆實。大抵爲聖賢豪傑張大其詞。謂與凡人異耳。如堯眉八彩。舜目重瞳。禹耳三漏。種種矝異者皆是。後世史家不察。因襲其陋。如項羽亦重瞳。漢高則隆準。而小說家當然推波助瀾。有沿用史書者。亦有自創奇說者。如手埀過膝。目能自顧其耳。丹鳳眼。臥蠶眉。豹目虎鬚。碧眼紫髯等等。幾於指不勝屈。不知此皆誤。聖賢豪傑。在志節。在學問。不關形貎。自有此等奇相之標異。一般人自顧相貎平常。不幾自餒志氣。怠修學問。以爲我相貎僅等常人。安望賢豪事業。灰天下人之心者。古史之誤也。孟子一書。義正辭嚴。儲子曰。王使之闞夫子。果有以異於人乎。孟子曰。何以異於人哉。堯舜與人同耳。可見眉目八彩。目重瞳。未必皆實也。岳鄂王稱大小眼將軍。此則實事。蓋一隻眼大。一隻眼小。在尋常說來。幾等五官不正。鄉里庸夫。類此者常有所見。故知非誇張賢豪而有此語也。前日挈兒輩游杭州。至明聖湖。謁岳廟。見鄂王塑像。因指示之曰·汝等不觀五右目略小。左目略大乎。答曰然。殆塑工非高手。致有此缺點耶。余曰非也。此必當時士紳細心。授意於塑工而爲之者。蓋自風波亭及難後。此惡耗尙未徧傅宮闈。或高宗有意秘之。亦未可知。久之。高宗母后忽詢高宗曰。『何久不見大小眼將軍。』高宗枝梧其辭以對。今鄂王塑像。果爲大小眼以是知當時士紳細心。必授意於塑工無疑也。又按相貎之有缺陷者。史書所見。殆皆紀實。如魏詠之兎缺。醫者謂可補。方干亦兎缺。顔</p>

<p>康有爲梁啟超者。師弟也。有爲以萬木草堂得名。啟超以飲冰室著聲。二人墓草俱靑。世已不知萬木草堂講學之所。而飲冰室文集。幾家喻户曉也。有爲啟超趨嚮不同。爲學亦異。而康梁並稱。則始於戊戌政變。有爲初名祖詒。字長素。亦字更生。復字更甡。采子興氏有爲者亦若是之旨。易名有爲。字則自擬素王。示其長日馨香崇拜之誠。或日。有爲頗詡其有孔子之長。此又一解也。粤之南海人。以停士授工部主事。時甲午中日之戰方罷。李鴻章惕於外患。亟謀和議。有爲不謂然。上書陳得失。謂戰敗兵家事。和仇辱國彌深。不納。同官爲其危。遂托病去。後三年。旅大爲俄據。膠澳爲德奪。人民口中莫不有瓜分之言。肝爲義憤形諸色。疏請變法圖强之道。恊辦大學士翁同龢以主致喪師辱國。不容於淸議。頗留心通達外情者。將引爲已助。至是力薦有爲才堪大用。胡勝臣十倍語。德宗垂涕私顧同龢曰。有爲固不免言大而誇。而懷才不遇。可於疏中字襄行間見之。太后旣不喜其人。無術使之入贊樞要。且資格尙淺。容徐圖之。已而。禮部侍郎徐致靖復稱其賢。德宗始召人對。令在總理各國事務衙門章京上行走。有爲殊怏怏。蓋當時所稱六君子譚嗣同林旭楊銳劉光第楊深秀康廣仁。俱授京卿預新政。廣仁係有爲之弟。聲望遠在乃兄下。尤難爲情也。德宗初欲藉袁世凱之兵衛。徐圖改革。六君子以少年掌樞要。主急進。喻以快刀斬亂蔴。嗣同性躁。視世無難事。密商世凱殺榮祿。以兵圍頣和園。逐后。擁德宗親政。蓋祿爲后所寵信。后惡帝。尤樂變法。世凱佯諾。而陰揭其謀祿。祿遂深宵叩園門。后驚起。祿伏地痕哭詳陳。后切齒曰。先發制人。爾之責也。祿唯唯而退。難作。潣君子者皆棄市。有爲先已因事如上海。聞變。易服匿西輪遁香港。渡海游歐美。撰十一國游記。立保皇黨。募欵於華僑。世傅其積資甚豐。匪可知矣。國變後始歸。嘗以長電論時政。刊不忍雜誌。申大同之說。於世凱宿怨未解。著論指其謬。世凱爲收拾人心。擬是以淸史館之任。有爲力辭。謂　修淸史。則世凱首爲罪人。不能無一言。世凱必不容。宜莫能爲也。復辟之議。張勳約有爲會於徐州。乘津浦車而去。屬販夫走卒中。以蒲扇掩面。而避人目。適黃陂召勳商大計。有爲密語勳曰。斯其時矣。遲則事敗也。勳意遂决。率師北上。有爲計偕。抵都日。迎於車驛者近千。勳入謁黃陂。諷以辭。黃陂不察。猶命李經義入居内閣。不三日。勳挾廢帝溥儀登大寳。黃龍旗飄　九衢。衆始知勳偕有爲至者。正爲此耳。僞詔任百官。授有爲弼德院副院長。大失所望。面斥勳不解政事。旣敗。走滬。貽書勳曰。後會無期。言外之意可見。政府令緝拿。賴啟超之援而免。居滬嘗共朱祖謀沈曾杆鄭胥之流。爲文酒之會。有爲曰。當世書家以曾植爲冠。其次則區區我也。自是遍游西北邊陲。復歷長江。所至謁當道。以提倡文化爲言。當道　其名。咸優遇之。稍有所獲。客死於膠海之濱。其年已逾七十矣。</p>

<p>— 卓陶</p>
<p>考貝扣之入中國，去今不過二十餘年。近年需用貝扣之廣，竟至一日千里，就上海一埠而言，由日本輸入之貝扣，年約四十餘萬元，其他各國猶不計也。近年來稍稍有注意者，然出產甚微，質品惡劣，尙不足以言抵制。我國貝扣原料之產地產額向無確切之調查及統計，給我人以稽考，然已知者如天津漢口江浙等地之鳥貝，山東之石决明，產額頗豐，且質地優良，然以貝扣製造事業不發達之故，專供日本爲原料。聞日本貝扣原料供不應求，常至中國及南洋各地採購，其採購手續都假手於華商，他日我人採購原料，當自不難，由此以觀，則貝扣製造事業之於我國爲極易發達及至有利之事，可以知之矣，有志者盍起而圖之！</p>
<p>貝扣之製造方法，雖依原料之種類，而有差異。至其工作之順序不外：毛胚，磨平，起邊，穿孔，漂白，磨光，發光，上臘八項。茲就各項依次列述如左：</p>
<p>（一）毛胚：空鑿毛胚，俗稱頭車，爲貝扣製造中之第一步，製鈕形之胚胎也。機有動力足踏之分，其全機之構造，爲廻轉運動，普通用足踏，以右手主持鑽頭之上下，以左手持貝殻，固置於受臺上；然後足踏廻轉，運動全機，同時將鑽頭順轉旋下，至鑿穿爲止，惟空鑿時，鑽頭因磨擦生熱而澎脹，一時不易取除，非特工作困難，且易失鑽頭之銳利，故須於機上附置水桶，即以冷水滳注而冷却之。</p>
<p>（二）磨光：毛胚之表裏大都凹凸不平，非經磨平之手續，對於以後之工作，殊多困難。機亦有動力足踏之分，俗稱二車，至其重要者，爲遍平圓形之金剛砂，及附屬之推進器。毛胚即用推進器推進，壓獨於金剛砂輪，因金剛砂之廻轉而毛胚即得以磨平也。</p>
<p>（三）起邊：貝扣之式樣，由起邊而異。以平胚嵌置於壔形圓柱中，推進起邊刀於胚面，廻轉壔形拉刀則於胚面徐徐起邊，</p>
<p>（四）穿孔：穿孔機之構造，極爲簡單，與起邊機相似，惟其主軸爲四本鋼針，針端貫通規正板，板之前附有螯形鐵架，爲置貝扣之用，貝扣之壓着，則用扁平之鐵條，足踏旋轉後，瞬息即能穿通。</p>
<p>（五）磨光：此段工程所以去其模棱圭角，而使扣面光滑也。普通以鼓形木桶廻轉之，其法先將貝扣傾入桶内，約占桶之三分之二，加淸水，過扣面二寸，再加細砂二握，然後閉桶蓋，不絕的廻轉數小時，或二畫夜，使其互相磨擦，以達光滑之境爲止。</p>
<p>（六）漂白：漂白乃賴藥品之力，以除去扣面之汚層，而顯貝扣固有之光澤，乃屬於化學作用者也。藥品之配合分量以貝扣之種類而異，茲舉一普通者如左；</p>
<p>水：十斤。過酸化鈉：五匙。硫酸：以試紙變赤爲止。</p>
<p>水玻璃：以試紙藍爲止。硫酸鎂：約十匙。</p>
<p>貝扣置於上配合之溶液中，以文火保持七八十度，經一畫夜即得。</p>
<p>（七）發光：貝扣製造雖經以上各工作，而光澤猶滯鈍，非再經此後加工不可。置漂白後之貝扣於鹽酸與Ｆarmali等混合之四％液中，廻轉二三十分，取出洗凈復八沸湯中沸之，再入發光桶中加强鹽酸廻轉之，若加過鹽化鐵少許則光澤更佳，廻轉完全後，置淸水中冷却之，</p>
<p>（八）上蠟：上蠟是乾燥後，再經一次發光手續也。其法先將發光之貝扣入布袋中，加入蠟木屑，兩人對持前後振盪之，半小時取出篩别即成。</p>
<p>貝扣之製造方法已盡於此，惟單賴學術，一無經騐，則所出貨品，定不良佳，故須有豐富之經騐，方能得良好之結果，蓋學術與經騐，案相輔而並行者也。</p>

<h3 id="c193">改良墳墓的我見 <a href="#c193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— 朱允宗</p>
<p>自從晋朝郭璞那個東西著了一部葬經創立風水之說以後，一般無知的人，把埋葬死人棺材一件事，看破一家興衰貧富貴賤窮通的關鍵，從此對於墳墓地點的選擇，不遣餘力：尤其是豪富之家，爲了幾塊棺材，特地聘請什麽有名地師，選買好風水的地方，建築陰宅，花花數千數萬塊錢也不算什麽希奇！</p>
<p>這樣一來，如今我們走到田野中去，只見五步一墳，十步一墓，好好的一段田地中每每有個把「土饅頭」佔據着。我想這樣下去，那害處倒不小哩！</p>
<p>墳墓有什麽害處呢？（一）增加迷信：人們信了風水，看重了墳墓，對於埋葬棺材，一定煞費心思，他們要從冥冥中求幸福，彼此爭相信傚，迷信的惡習日深！况且有了墳墓，還要年年幹那祭祀鬼戲呢！（二）糜費金錢時間：選擇墳地，要請地師，要買田地，要築墳墓，要造墳屋，糜費多少的金錢和時間呢？（三）减少生產：田地是物產的母親，墳墓一多，佔了許多田地，物產自然减少：我國以農立國，而農產供不應求，仰給外洋貨特，這也是一個原因呵！</p>
<p>墳墓的害處有這般大！那非趕緊改良不可了！</p>
<p>改良辦法：（一）已有墳墓，由官廳下令開掘墾平，以便耕種。（二）由官廰劃定區域，設立公墓，下令呌民家把棺材葬在處。（三）不從命令的處以罰金。</p>
<p>這樣廢除私有墳墓施行公墓制度之後，有三種利益：</p>
<p>（一）迷信可以剷除了。</p>
<p>（二）金錢時間可以節省了。</p>
<p>（三）生產可以增加了。</p>
<p>鄙見如斯，諸君以爲何如？請參加討論爲幸！</p>

<p>Ｋ在高中畢業了。在他完畢了他的畢業考試，正在期待着拿文憑的時候，他心裏時常得意地想：憑着他的資格和本領到社會去找事做，是絕對受人到處歡迎的。在他的眉際間，常常映着愉快和希望的影子。</p>
<p>這是一句老話，而現在卻成了一個不變的定義了：「事案與願望是相反的：願望愈大，失望亦大。」Ｋ踏進了社會之檻，他漸漸承認這句話了。但他還未示弱，亦不覺氣沮，他再接再厲。聽說最近他已被介紹到一家機關裏做筆頭上的工作，我爲他欣喜之餘，正要寫信去賀他，很意外的先接到他的來信，信上是這樣寫着的，在他的筆跡中，頗流露着很大的忿怒和悲苦的情調與顔色。</p>

<p>「靑年的弱者呀，誰呌你跑到這個殘酷的絕對没有人類同情的所謂人的社會裏來？旣來了，又爲何不勇敢些向你的敵人奮鬥，進攻，而取得你的飯碗呢？這又怪誰來？」當我在苦悶無辦法的時候，有一團漆黑的東西滾到我面前裝着鬼臉而又像正經一般含譏帶諷地激勵我。朋友啊，我何嘗不想自拔呢？有時竟準備來幹一下、然而，結果呢，這不幸的結果，往往會使你幻想到你已脫離了這所謂社會，這所謂人，獨自去到一個荒島裏—</p>

<p>「我跑到上海，找到了ＸＸ路ＸＸ里Ｘ號，開門一看，原來是一個小小亭子問，裏面坐着一個年在二十七八歲的穿着西裝的靑年，他問我來意畢，要我寫三張履歷單，并繳了二十元所謂敎員的保證金，那靑年說··過三天寫信通知你，到底請不請，因爲應聘者已有三十餘人，位置只有三個，如果不合，那保證金可以來領回···」我於是回來了，在家裏等了三天，没有隻字的通知，心中以爲不合格，便到上海去領回保證金，不料到了那裏，門也關了，人也不在了，門上貼起了一張招租，那時我方才知道受騙，但已經來不了···」</p>
<p>我聽了他的話，心中頗爲不平，但這有如何辦法呢？只得安慰他道，「多一次失敗，多一次經騐。」</p>

<h3 id="e1">Regarding the Feelings on the British Government's Formulation of the Indian Ethnic Electoral System, by Zi. <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The news of the London government's formulation of the Indian ethnic electoral system on the 16th was seen in yesterday's Reuters news. The people of our country are deeply mired in an unprecedented national crisis. It is difficult to say to what extent we can pay attention to this foreign news dispatch. However, the experience of our great Asian neighbor, struggling from darkness to light over the past three years, and its current situation, are enough to provide some lessons for our countrymen struggling for national salvation. This seems undeniable.</p>
<p>The reason why the Indian question has been able to attract worldwide attention in recent years is that it is an activity for the liberation of the majority of mankind in 1.8 million square miles. Recalling two years ago, on the shores of the Indian Ocean, in the Bay of Bengal, the voice of "complete Indian independence" was raised, and the imprisonment of 30,000 people was used as an expression of their determination. The world's small and weak nations looked up and breathed a sigh of relief. However, before long, the internal conflicts between Indians and Muslims became increasingly fierce, inevitably reducing the strength of the entire liberation movement. It was already foreseen by discerning people that the British-Indian Round Table Conference would not have good results. Now, MacDonald's god must be troubled to determine "measures to deal with the Indian ethnic issue." Even if we cannot feel sympathy for foreign events, can we avoid sighing with emotion when we look back at ourselves, who are struggling for national salvation?</p>
<p>The crux of the British-Indian problem lies in the fact that Britain only allows India to seek self-government within the constitution given by the British, while India demands complete independence. The British government's ethnic electoral system, as stated in MacDonald's statement, is a way to remove obstacles to constitutional development and the first step in implementing the new constitution. It is still only seeking solutions within the scope of the constitution. Remembering Dewey's discussion of thought, he once described how bees, recognizing that the light from the glass window could lead them out, flew towards the light several times, only to hit the glass window and fall to the ground in a daze, illustrating the helplessness of those with lower thinking abilities. We still do not know whether the Indian nation will accept this ethnic electoral system and align themselves with bees that fall to the ground in a daze and ultimately cannot find a way out. However, we are also in a different position, looking at the light and seeking a way out. Thinking of the great disaster to come, we have no time to grieve for India.</p>
<p>We are not yet able to know the specific measures of the so-called ethnic electoral system in detail. What Reuters news agency described are only trivial news about the number of seats for Indians and Muslims in each province, which cannot be used to comment on the system. However, in British Prime Minister MacDonald's statement, one sentence said, "The various ethnic groups in India have repeatedly tried to solve the problem themselves, but have ultimately failed to reach an agreement with each other." Another sentence said, "Indians must realize that they themselves have repeatedly failed to propose concrete solutions..." It seems that the rule of India cannot do without the British. And today's matter, should we express our gratitude to the British? We do not know whether Gandhi, who is in prison, can represent the Indian nation in making a statement.</p>

<p>(Shenyang) After the Liaodong Righteous Army attacked Anshan on the 16th and shelled Director Lin's special train, they retreated to their original positions for defense. At 10:00 last night, they attacked the two stations of Anshan Nantai again. The general beheaded about 300 people and killed six Korean traitors. After more than six hours of fighting, they retreated to their original defense at 5:00 this morning. As a result, the entire train line is closed and the railway has been destroyed in many places.

<p>Yesterday morning at 4:00, hundreds of righteous soldiers attacked Longzhengzhou and Jidongyu in the southeast of Qianshan Station on the South Manchurian Railway line, and killed 46 residents there. The Anshan garrison and police are discussing countermeasures. (Dentsu News Agency, 18th)</p>

<p>(Shenyang) At 11:00 last night, about 500 righteous soldiers attacked between Nantai and Tougang on the main line of the South Manchurian Railway, cutting off the telegraph and telephone lines of the Manchurian Railway. At 1:00 this morning, about 300 righteous soldiers surrounded and attacked Nantai Station. The Japanese garrison, police, and self-defense corps fought back, echoing the Japanese garrison and field artillery units rushed from Haicheng and Anshan. After a fierce battle lasting six hours, the righteous army was repelled at 5:00 in the morning. As a result, all trains on the main line of the Manchurian Railway south of Shenyang cannot operate.

<p>(Beiping) More than 10,000 righteous soldiers besieged Jinzhou Station and formed a suicide squad to charge into the station. They advanced and retreated repeatedly, and both sides suffered heavy casualties. Telegraph lines and tracks in Shuangyangdian, Liulinghe, Yangquanzi and other places were all destroyed. The pseudo-Fengshan Railway only operated for one day before being suspended again. (Special Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Shanhaiguan) The righteous army believes that the political situation has gradually stabilized, so it will still take advantage of the green gauze curtain period to give the Japanese army a serious blow. It is currently planning to take Jinzhou in one fell swoop. It is rumored that Jinzhou has recently been besieged by the righteous army again. This information has not yet been received here. (Special Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to news from Chinese and foreign sources arriving in Beiping, the Northeast Righteous Army is engaged in fierce battles with the Japanese army everywhere. Chinese sources admit that the Righteous Army has suffered many setbacks and has withdrawn from the railway area north of Yuguan, so trains can resume operation. However, according to news this morning, 12,000 righteous soldiers are again fighting to the death with the Japanese army in Jinzhou. Because the telegraph lines have been cut off, the Japanese army sent dozens of pairs of carrier pigeons to Goubangzi for help. The Japanese army in the area from Dagushan to Tongliao Railway launched a counterattack near Tongliao. According to Chinese sources, the Japanese counterattack has not made much progress. It is also said that Japanese planes fly over Tongliao from time to time, dropping bombs and leaflets. As for the battles in other places, both sides claim to have won. Because there is no way to verify, it is difficult to believe immediately. (Reuters Dispatch, 18th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Because Yao Ruifang's troops of the National Salvation Army lacked ammunition, they withdrew from Jinzhou to the Gaojiatun area. On the 15th, Yao led three attendants to Jinzhou for reconnaissance. They encountered six Japanese soldiers on foot patrol at Jiaoda for inspection. Yao opened fire and killed two Japanese soldiers. The Japanese side mobilized air force tanks to launch a large-scale attack. (Special Dispatch, 18th)</p>

<p>(Shanhaiguan) Six Japanese planes from Jinzhou flew to Xiaoma'an Fort and Malingtun outside Yuguan at noon on the 17th for bombing, dropping more than 30 bombs, most of which were incendiary bombs. More than 20 households were burned down, and three villagers were killed or injured. The rest all fled. The area is more than 20 li away from the pass and is beyond our administrative authority, so it is difficult to investigate in detail. In addition, two planes have been reconnoitering in Huangtuying, east of the Great Wall, for a long time before leaving.

<p>Zhang Orders Generals to Return to Their Defense Areas Quickly and Serve with Peace of Mind</p>
<p>(Beiping) Before the generals in North China sent a telegram to urge Zhang to stay, the generals originally planned to send a joint telegram to the National Government to retain Wang and Zhang. Yesterday, Wang had automatically left Nanjing, so it was changed to urging Zhang to stay alone. Zhang has not yet expressed his opinion but has ordered the generals to obey orders, serve with peace of mind, and urged the generals to return to their defense areas quickly. Tonight, several generals visited Song Zheyuan to exchange views on the matter of urging Zhang to stay again. There was a meeting at Wan Fulin's residence tonight. (Special Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Beijing) News from this city: Song Zheyuan, Shang Zhen, and others sent a telegram to Director Zhang Xueliang of the Beiping Pacification Office yesterday. The original text is as follows: Zhang Jun, Director of the Beiping Pacification Office, I believe that the lost land has not been recovered and foreign aggression is deepening. Zheyuan and others are soldiers and share the same defense. Recently, since you have followed the Central Government's strategy and ordered active preparations, all our soldiers have been sharpening their swords and waiting for the dawn, hoping to resist the strong enemy like a wild boar and a long snake, even at the cost of their lives. How can it be said that at this critical moment, waves have suddenly risen in the vast political sea, and you, considering the difficulties of the time, attach importance to your own responsibility, and suddenly resign from your post. Zheyuan and others are incompetent and have served poorly. Taking away the general from the three armies and losing the bridge in the unfinished situation, we are extremely frightened after hearing the news. I think that the security of North China is of great importance, and you have been entrusted with the trust of the country and shoulder the heavy responsibility of military affairs. You should follow the Central Government's intentions and try to turn the tide, but how can you lightly resign and retire at the request of one person. If you resign from your duties, North China will lose the selection of the Great Wall, and the soldiers will lose the resources of leadership. After this, all the internal and external problems will inevitably fall into great difficulties. Zheyuan and others have the heart to serve the country but have no way to save the crisis. I have always relied on driving and urging and am especially eager to follow. Rather than leave the problem for later, we will simply retreat now. After thinking about it a hundred times, if you insist on leaving, Zheyuan and others will only have to abdicate and retire with you. I hope you will appreciate our foolish sincerity.

<p>(Beiping) Zhang Qun discussed the organization law of the Beiping Branch of the Military Affairs Commission, which is the same as the Central Military Affairs Commission, and said that it is difficult to set up a Chief of Staff. The staff of the Beiping Branch should be changed from the staff of the Pacification Office. The rest will wait for the Beiping affairs to come to an end before going to Shanxi. He has decided to resign from the position of the Beiping Branch. It is rumored that Tang Yulin has resigned, all of which are rumors. (Special Dispatch, 18th)</p>

<p>(Jinan) Mi Chunlin, Zhang Xueliang's representative, returned to Beiping from Shanghai via Jinan today. Mi said that he brought Zhang's handwritten letters to Wang and the ministers of various departments. The general idea of the letters was that Zhang, in view of the Japanese's inching forward, was determined to be on the front line of resistance, but the rear must be thoroughly prepared by the Central Government for a long-term resistance plan. Wang originally agreed to meet on the 6th, but Wang went to Shanghai on the evening of the 5th. I rushed to but could not see him. If I had seen Wang one day earlier, the matter of Wang and Zhang's resignation might have changed the topic and would not have been so expanded. In addition, Peng Shibin, Zhang's representative stationed in Jinan, returned to Beiping today. (Special Dispatch, 18th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) The voice of retaining Zhang in North China is getting higher and higher, especially in the military. Last night, it was learned that 57 generals in the North jointly telegraphed to Zhang, urging him not to resign, saying that this is a time of unprecedented national difficulty, how can they lose the leader who has worked with them for more than ten years. Moreover, maintaining the security and order of North China depends on the unity of all the soldiers. How can they resign and leave in the midst of national crisis simply because of domestic political relations. If they must resign, they will also resign at the same time. The signatories are not only Zhang's old subordinates, but also Shanxi and former National Army generals are among them. In addition to Tang Yulin and Wan Fulin, Shang Zhen and Song Zheyuan also signed. (Reuters Dispatch, 18th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) According to diplomatic sources, Japan, on the pretext that our country's increase in the import tariff rates for silk violates the spirit of reciprocity, has protested to our country. The Japanese Consul in Nanjing, Uemura, sent the protest letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Japanese side claims that France has also formally protested. However, the Ministry of Finance has not yet received a notice from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the protest raised by Japan. As for France, the French Minister has sent a letter to Foreign Minister Luo in a private capacity, requesting a slight change based on the principle of reciprocity, and there is no protest. It is investigated that all countries levy special taxes on imported luxury goods, and some even levy 300% of the value. Our country's new tax rate is at most 70%, which is less than half of the tax rate of other countries. Moreover, our country's customs duties are already autonomous, and there is no need to notify in advance of tax rate increases and decreases. Moreover, the new tax rate has already been implemented and there is no reason to change it. (Special Dispatch, 18th)</p>

It is generally speculated that since Niu and Wang have committed the crime of endangering the Republic of China and the evidence from the investigation is conclusive, they should be sentenced to capital punishment. However, the prosecutor argued during the plea that Article 2 of the Amnesty Act could be applied, so they may be reduced to life imprisonment. However, Niu and Wang are quite dissatisfied with this trial and have reportedly decided to appeal after the sentence is announced. (18th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

Liu Wenguan, section chief, and military officer battalion commander and above, totaling 431 people, were ex officio members. Han Fuqu reported the purpose of the meeting, saying that the national atmosphere has deteriorated in recent years, and prostitution and gambling are rampant, which is enough to ruin families and destroy the country. The organization of this society is to set a standard in this bad society and encourage each other. He hopes everyone will strive to abstain from prostitution and gambling. Han said that North China is generally stable, but Pingjin is worrying in the future. The failure of national affairs lies in the inability to be frank with each other. Reports that Zhang telegraphed Yu to go to Ping are not accurate. Chiang may also not be able to go to Ping recently.

<h3 id="e48">Possibility of Cooperation Between Germany's Two Major Parties <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>There is a Problem with the Interim Chairman of the New Parliament</p>
<p>A National News Agency telegram from Berlin on the 17th stated that although the German President and Prime Minister insisted on setting up a supra-party presidential cabinet, believing that the divisions among the parties in the current parliament could not form a solid foundation for a cabinet, some major parties still have ambitions and do not believe that they cannot form a parliamentary cabinet. According to a report by Voltschitz of the Democratic Party, there is a possibility of cooperation between the National Socialist Party and the Center Party in German political circles. Because the National Socialist Party's plan to seize power alone has failed, it has recently expressed to the Center Party its willingness to negotiate with the party, hoping to elect a legitimate Prussian Prime Minister in the Prussian parliament and abolish the temporary measures of the Federal Administrative Committee. It is still remembered that the Center Party had proposed to the two major right-wing parties last week to hold a meeting to discuss this matter. At that time, the National Socialist Party argued that the consultation should be postponed because it was discussing the issue of forming a federal government. Now that the negotiations between National Socialist Party leader Hitler and the President have broken down, he wants to turn to the Center Party to discuss conditions, hoping to at least control the Prussian regime. It should be noted, however, that the National People's Party will no longer participate in the negotiations in the future, because the National People's Party is now closer to the Papen cabinet and seems unwilling to elect a prime minister by the Prussian parliament, still hoping that the Federal Prime Minister will appoint an administrative committee. Therefore, the National Socialist Party specifically requested the Center Party to exclude the National People's Party from the consultation meeting. Although the trend of future consultations between the two parties is not very good due to the Center Party's insistence that the Prussian Prime Minister should be filled by someone who is not bound by party affiliation, there is still the possibility of understanding. If the two parties unite, they can occupy a majority position in both the Prussian parliament and the German parliament, which is enough to change the political situation. The new parliament is scheduled to convene on August 30th, and preparations for the meeting have begun. Former Speaker Loebe has invited representatives from various parties to gather on Saturday to discuss purely parliamentary affairs, such as the arrangement of seats. In this new parliament, Mrs. Jeckin, a female Communist Party member, is the oldest. Whether she will be publicly recommended as the interim chairman before the new speaker is elected is also a matter that requires careful consideration. Jeckin has sent a telegram from Moscow that she will return to Berlin to perform the duties of interim chairman, while the National Socialist Party is strongly opposed, saying that letting Jeckin be chairman would be a shame for both the German and Aryan nations, so it is difficult to resolve. However, Jeckin is 75 years old, her eyes are almost blind, and she is very weak, and even her own party doubts that she can really be competent for the heavy task of chairman.</p>

It is now heard that the court will announce the verdict on this case soon.

<h3 id="e52">Picard Undertakes Another High-Altitude Exploration <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Ascends by Balloon to a Height of 16,500 Meters</p>
<p>Sends Wireless Reports of High-Altitude News from the Stratosphere</p>
<p>▲ A Reuters telegram from Bern, Switzerland, on the 18th stated that the first wireless telegram from the stratosphere was received on Earth. This telegram was sent by Professor Picard, who reported that the balloon had risen more than ten miles, exceeding his own previous record. The balloon is still rising slowly.</p>
<p>▲ A Reuters telegram from Zurich on the 18th stated that Professor Picard and his assistant Dr. Kossins made their second attempt to reach the stratosphere at 5:05 this morning. Picard and Kossins were seated in an airtight aluminum chamber, which was attached to a large balloon. Last night, Picard saw that the weather was turning better, so he re-examined the aluminum chamber and the various sophisticated instruments it contained, including a wireless transmitter. Then he made gas to fill the balloon. A large crowd came to watch, all wanting to see Picard rise into the sky. After working busily all night, they took off after dawn, rising slowly. This trip is intended to capture images of cosmic rays and obtain their theoretical basis. According to reports, Picard and Kipfer rode a balloon together on May 27th of last year in Würzburg, Bavaria, and entered the stratosphere. At that time, there was an anticyclone, and the balloon drifted in the air for 18 hours before falling somewhere 160 kilometers south. This trip reached a height of about 15 and a half kilometers above the ground, approximately four kilometers into the stratosphere, breaking the record for the altitude reached by a manned balloon or airplane.</p>
<p>▲ A National News Agency telegram from Zurich on the 18th stated that Professor Picard of the Free University of Brussels rose in a balloon from the Dübendorf airfield here at 5:05 this morning to conduct his second high-altitude test of the stratosphere. The main purpose of this trip is to continue studying cosmic rays and calibrate the various records obtained during the first ascent last May. The round chamber in which Picard and his assistant Gilboe were riding has been greatly improved compared to last year. The chamber is made of an alloy of lead and is completely coated with white enamel to reflect sunlight and prevent the interior from being as hot as it was last year. The observation windows have also increased from one to eight, plus an entrance. The arrangement of the window holes allows people in the chamber to fully see the atmospheric phenomena around the balloon above and the ground below. The entrance and exit have also been greatly improved. If opened during flight, they can be closed from the inside, and all equipment is impermeable to water to prevent the airship from unfortunately falling into the sea or lakes when it lands. Even the balloon piston door that enters the chamber passes through a mercury chamber to prevent water seepage. The diameter of the chamber is 2.2 meters and weighs about 550 pounds. In addition to various scientific instruments and two seats, there is also a shortwave wireless transceiver. The balloon's bag is the largest in the world, with a capacity of 14,000 cubic meters. Its load, including the ballast lead, is 3,520 pounds. Before departing, Picard told people that he had planned a third ascent, the location of which is planned to be in North America or near Hudson Bay, because it is closest to the Earth's magnetic pole. Although this move is costly, it has immeasurable value for studying the aurora borealis and other sky phenomena. He also said that the ballast lead he carried this time weighed 1,650 kilograms. As for whether the balloon will go north or south after rising, it is difficult to predict. After the balloon was unmoored and rose slowly, Picard waved goodbye to thousands of spectators from the window and gave a flying kiss to his wife and family. Also, when the balloon was unmoored, Swiss aviator Mittelholzer drove a three-motor Fokker airplane and carried a film camera to set off first, intending to fly with the balloon to 5,000 meters to shoot a film, but returned to the airfield after 20 minutes, saying that the balloon was rising extremely fast and had reached 4,900 meters. After that, the ascent accelerated even more, so he stopped chasing it. Later, at 7:45, Picard's balloon floated past Richterschwanden, and at about 7:30, it flew past Wallenstadt, close to the Austrian border. According to electrical measurements, its altitude reached 15,000 meters. Continuing telegram: Professor Picard has reached the highest altitude ever reached by humans, far higher than his last time. At 11:15 this morning, his balloon passed over the sky of Reichenau-Garten, about 100 miles southeast of Zurich. At that time, he was heading towards Urdorf on the border between Switzerland and Austria. Its altitude was between 17,000 meters and 18,000 meters above the ground. According to the last ascent, it reached 51,793 feet, which is about 15,000 meters.</p>
<p>▲ A Havas news agency telegram from Milan, Italy, on the 18th stated that Professor Picard's balloon has descended near the village of Iseo, near Brescia, Italy.</p>
<p>▲ A Havas news agency telegram from Mirik, Switzerland, on the 18th stated that Professor Picard set off this morning and ascended with his assistant Kossin for high-altitude exploration. This exploration has aroused great interest in scientific circles in various countries, because Picard's ascent may be able to observe the cosmic rays discovered by Professor Millikan of the United States in the high altitude. This morning, the airfield was obscured by dense fog. After the rope holding the balloon to the ground broke, the balloon rose. The initial ascent was very slow, but after Picard and Kossin took their seats at the bottom of the balloon, the balloon ascended in an accelerated state. When it rose to a height of 1,500 meters, the balloon moved south. At 8:00 AM, the Santis Observatory reported that the balloon was flying over the Baniña mountain range at a height of 11 to 12 kilometers. The balloon was still rising rapidly. At 10:40, the Davos reported that the balloon was still moving south and could no longer be seen with the naked eye. At 11:30, Professor Picard sent a wireless message saying, "Flying over the Engadine mountain range at a height of 16,500 meters. Everything is going well, but it is extremely cold." At 11:40, a second report was received, saying, "To avoid falling into the Adriatic Sea, we are landing. We can now see Lake Garda."</p>
<p>▲ A Havas news agency telegram from Vienna on the 18th stated that the Austrian people have paid close attention to Professor Picard's high-altitude exploration. When Picard's airship appeared in the sky over Voralberg, the director of the Aspern airfield in Vienna immediately notified meteorologically skilled aviators to exchange messages with Professor Picard by wireless and transmit reports to the Austrian Aviation Association at any time. The National Radio Station constantly communicated with Picard and broadcast news to various places when the balloon arrived in Vienna.</p>

<p>A National News Agency telegram from the Bolivian capital on the 17th stated that war clouds have reappeared on the horizon between Bolivia and Paraguay today. A communiqué from the Bolivian Army Department stated that Paraguayan cavalry attacked the Bolivian defense forces on the Chaco (i.e., Chaco) border. One officer in the observation post was killed in action.</p>
<p>A National News Agency telegram from the Paraguayan capital on the 17th stated that the Paraguayan government announced today that Bolivian armed forces attacked Paraguayans in the Casado district. The outcome of the conflict is still unknown.</p>
<p>▲ A Havas news agency telegram from Washington on the 18th stated that the neutral countries in the Americas have again sent a letter of conciliation to Bolivia, stating that the purpose of the countries is to seek an appropriate solution to maintain the permanent interests of the American continent. The letter also requested Bolivia to put forward concrete suggestions so that an arbitration agreement could be concluded.</p>

<p>A National News Agency telegram from Vienna on the 17th stated that the international loan agreed upon in Lausanne was passed by the Austrian Parliament this afternoon by a vote of 81 to 80 in the third reading. This time, because a small party split and supported the government with six votes, and the remaining two votes joined the opposition party, the government was able to obtain a majority of votes. Before the vote, the government, aware of the seriousness of the situation, went everywhere to arrange for all the parliamentarians who supported the government to attend. A certain parliamentarian who had recently suffered from paralysis was also sent to the parliament by someone to vote. During the debate on this case, the opposition party, with the Social Democratic Party and the Greater German Party as the backbone, most strongly attacked the political conditions, which restricted Austria from forming a customs union with Germany or other political and economic agreements before 1952 or before the loan was repaid, which would open up the path to the merger of the two countries.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Lancashire Cotton Weavers Brewing National Strike <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>A Reuters telegram from London on the 17th stated that the crisis of a strike in the Lancashire cotton industry seems to be getting more and more urgent because both labor and management in the cotton spinning industry have a firm attitude. Gray, the president of the English Cotton Mill Employers' Association, the main organization for cotton employers, said today that employers will not be subject to any external interference regarding the issue of rehiring laid-off workers. Gray's remarks are highly valued because the issue of rehiring is the main point of contention. An executive committee member of the Northern Textile General Trade Union, which is composed of ten cotton weaving unions, said that the weavers are determined, and a national strike is almost inevitable. Workers in several places are disappointed that they could not start a strike immediately. Workers in individual cotton mills in various cotton-producing areas are now stopping work to protest against the factory's plan to reduce wages. There was a slight disturbance in Burnley last night. Many strikers gathered to demonstrate against the female workers who were still working in the cloth factory, and police officers who were protecting the female workers were injured by stones thrown by the rioters. Several troublemakers have been detained.</p>

<p>▲ A Reuters telegram from London on the 17th stated that Guo Taiqi, the Chinese envoy to the UK, told a Reuters reporter today that he was very happy to be welcomed after arriving in the UK, but he felt that the British people did not understand the truth about China very well, which he found very strange. In his opinion, China is gradually moving towards stability and entering a period of construction. When asked about the recent cabinet reshuffle, Guo replied that the real position would not be affected by this, because Wang Jingwei's policy of resigning from the post of President of the Executive Yuan was unanimously approved by the whole country. Guo reiterated China's determination to reject Japan's policy of aggression in the East Three Provinces, but said that China will seek its territorial and administrative integrity in accordance with the League of Nations Charter and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, as guaranteed by the League of Nations and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. When the reporter asked about Japan's position in the League of Nations, Guo replied that he did not think that Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations would materialize. In any case, Japan will be bound by the League of Nations resolutions for the next two years and cannot withdraw rashly. Guo also said that the claim that China is carrying out anti-Japanese propaganda is purely a slander, because China's only wish is peace. Guo did not say that if Japan does not withdraw from the East Three Provinces, the financial situation will solve this problem on its own.</p>

<p>▲ Moscow (TASS, 17th) – According to the plan approved by the People's Commissariat of Agriculture, the Soviet Union's autumn planting this year will cover 42,000,000 hectares, of which 29,000,000 hectares will be operated by collective farms, 9,000,000 hectares by individual farms, and 3,500,000 hectares by state-owned farms. The harvest period for industrial grains is approaching, and harvesting has already begun in several places. The area sown with industrial grains this year has increased by 1,000,000 hectares compared to last year. 500,000 hectares, or 20 percent, of hemp fields were harvested by August 10th. This year's cotton harvest is slightly earlier than last year. Currently, 80 percent of cotton fields, 50 percent of hemp fields, and 60 percent of sugar beet fields have been collectivized. 800 state-owned machinery stations are assisting with the cultivation of industrial grains, and 60 percent of the cotton harvest has been mechanized.</p>

<h3 id="e65">Japanese Attempt to Exploit Mongolian Soldiers Fails <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>A letter from the Liaoning Communications Office states: "Recently, a telegram from Nie Riqi, the special commissioner in charge of reporting intelligence in Kailu, stated that the safety of the area bordering Liaoning, Rehe, and Heilongjiang depends on the Mongolians. The Japanese attempted to organize three Mongolian cavalry armies to launch a large-scale attack on Rehe. Fortunately, the Cui Brigade stationed in Kailu killed Matsui, who was specifically responsible for plotting against Mongolia, reducing the Mongolian threat. Subsequently, Bao Shanyi of the First Army defected after Gao Wenbin's pacification efforts, and the Second Army also sincerely surrendered. At the same time, Brigade Commander Cui Xinwu sent the Mongolian Hu Baoshan to incorporate over 3,000 Mongolian cavalrymen into a supplementary regiment. Recently, Hu Baoshan, the commander of the Second Army Tong Brigade, and Chief of Staff Zhang, representing the Third Army, reached an agreement with the Volunteer Army's Li Fangting to join forces and attack the Siping-Taonan Line, taking Taonan and Angangxi to the south to connect with Gao Wenbin and Bao Shanyi, and to the north with Ma Zhanshan. All the Mongolian cavalry have become aware of the situation and are united with the Han people to jointly launch an attack."</p>
<h3 id="e66">Zhu Jiqing's Three Declarations <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Zhu Jiqing, Commander-in-Chief of the Northeastern National Salvation Army, recently issued three declarations, which are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ A Letter to Compatriots in Cities and Villages of Northeast China: This time, the Japanese invasion and occupation of the three northeastern provinces is a major event related to the survival of the Chinese nation. All compatriots across the country, unwilling to be slaves of a conquered nation, should make a common determination, regardless of regional differences, to face the national crisis. Recently, young people from all walks of life in the mainland have been continuously coming to the northeast to join the volunteer army, and donations of military supplies have also been extremely enthusiastic. All this proves that resisting the Japanese invaders has now become a unified trend throughout the country. The Northeast, at present, is completely under the trampling of the Japanese invaders. From September 18th of last year to now, it has been almost a year. The fire is getting hotter, and the water is getting deeper. Local compatriots feel the pain to the bone, and their awareness of foreign matters is naturally more profound and clear than that of compatriots in the mainland. Then, is it not a divinely ordained responsibility to unite and resist the Japanese invaders to the end until all lost land is recovered? Since invading the Northeast, the Japanese invaders have inflicted all kinds of cruel oppression on Chinese compatriots, and the following matters are particularly hateful: (1) Confiscation of Firearms: Civilian firearms are essential for self-defense. After confiscation, the power of self-defense is completely lost. In the future, no matter how rampant the Japanese and their ignorant military police are, there will be no possibility of resistance. Japan had previously implemented this law in Korea. Not only firearms, but also ordinary kitchen knives used by Koreans are subject to strict restrictions. To this day, 20 million Koreans are swallowing their voices and enduring beatings, with no hope of recovery. This is truly a lesson from the past. (2) Reclamation of Banner Lands: The lands of the various banners in the Northeast have long been opened up, especially the banner lands throughout Liaoning, which have long been occupied and managed by Han people at a price, and they have lived in harmony. This time, the Japanese invaders actually used the puppet state to fabricate excuses to reclaim them. In general, the most poisonous method for foreigners to control colonies is to cut off the economic lifeline of the local people. The intention of the Japanese invaders is truly a matter that everyone knows. Once implemented, the precious land on which countless compatriots depend for their livelihoods will be plundered, and they will have to become proletarians and live a miserable life. Originally, the number of so-called banner people currently existing in the eastern provinces is limited. The land reclaimed by the puppet state will be enjoyed by the banner people in name only. In fact, very few will benefit. Many fertile lands will only be freely used by the Japanese and some Koreans who are willing to be dogs. (3) Strict Implementation of Informing: Resisting the Japanese invaders is what everyone naturally thinks. Precisely because of this, the more the Japanese invaders suspect, the more restrictive methods emerge endlessly. The inspection of travelers, the search of homes, and the harassment are too numerous to mention. The use of Chinese traitors to allow informing is especially alarming. Among our compatriots, there are indeed those who participate in anti-Japanese work or join volunteer army organizations and are arrested because they are informed. There is nothing to regret about this. But among them, there are many cowardly compatriots who are afraid of the fierce power and are cautious in their actions. They have no actions at all, but because of the revenge of enemies and private grudges, or because the extortion of thugs has not been successful, they are also falsely accused and wronged because of informing, and their lives and property are sacrificed. How painful and hateful this is! In addition to these various atrocities, they are too numerous to mention, regardless of urban or rural areas. Compatriots in the countryside are generous and passionate, resisting the Japanese invaders, cutting off their blood and righteousness, and their loyalty reaches the sky. Compatriots in the cities, due to different circumstances, have a slightly slower resistance performance, but the anti-Japanese enthusiasm in everyone's heart has never been less intense. This is conceivable. However, I still have some concerns. Although both urban and rural areas suffer from the disasters of the Japanese invaders, the degree is quite different. Generally speaking, compatriots in the cities are more easily protected because there have always been more troops and police stationed locally. The number of self-defense firearms purchased is small, and their main occupation is in business, and there is not much agriculture, so the two points of the Japanese invaders' confiscation of firearms and reclamation of banner lands have little impact on compatriots in the cities. As for the various personnel of the Japanese invaders, they are mostly stationed in urban areas, and it is easier for compatriots in the cities to contact them. The informers have some scruples, so they are naturally less harmed than compatriots in the countryside. Moreover, the Japanese are very cunning. At this time, the entire territory of the Northeast is disturbed and uneasy, and it is inconvenient to make enemies everywhere. It is a very good strategy to feign appeasement and win over the hearts of the people for a part of the people in the urban areas. In the past, at the beginning of the Japanese conquest of Korea, they also suppressed the countryside and relaxed the urban areas. At that time, the resistance of the Korean people was also fierce in the countryside and slow in the urban areas. Later, the eight-province cleanup policy changed, and the treatment of the people in the urban areas was a hundred times worse than in the countryside. Those with a little wealth and knowledge were all labeled as reactionaries and arbitrarily arrested and killed without any politeness. The heavy taxes and miscellaneous taxes were as dense as the hair of an ox, and they were mostly borne by the people in the cities. The people in the urban areas regretted this later, but it was too late. Now the Japanese invaders are still using the method of deceiving the Korean people to deceive the compatriots in the urban areas of the Northeast. If the compatriots in the urban areas do not have a very distant vision and follow the Japanese invaders' cunning plans, then the disasters suffered by the people in the urban areas of Korea will be seen again in the Northeast. This is something that cannot but be worried about. Therefore, I would like to earnestly and sincerely advise compatriots from all walks of life in both urban and rural areas, especially those in the cities. Urban and rural areas are one body. The city is like the head of a person, and the countryside is like the limbs of a person. It is impossible for the limbs to be destroyed and the head to be healthy. From now on, everyone should be thoroughly aware of this, be of one mind and one heart, and work together to drive the Japanese invaders out of the country in order to protect the reputation of the Chinese nation and avoid the re-enactment of the Korean tragedy. I am not talented, and I will secretly pray for it. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e67">Guangdong Merchants Formulate Plans to Suppress Communist Bandits in Jiangxi <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>▲ Yu Hanmou Returns to Guangdong to Participate in Communist Suppression Conference</p>
<p>▲ Various Jiangnan Armies are Now Taking Advantage of the Situation to Search and Suppress Remaining Bandits</p>
<p>▲ Bai Chongxi and Cai Tingkai's Representatives Will Arrive</p>
<p>After the Communist bandits in southern Jiangxi retreated from Xinfeng to Huichang, the Guangdong army in southern Jiangxi adopted a step-by-step approach, waiting for the armies of the three provinces to establish contact before launching a large-scale encirclement. Recently, the First Division of the First Army of Yu Hanmou's troops in the Xinfeng area has been transferred back to Nankang, the Second Division of Ye Zhao's troops has returned to Ganzhou, and the 　 Division of Li Zhenqiu's troops has been ordered to go to Chongyi and other counties in western Jiangxi to search for remaining bandits. This division arrived at Nantang on the 10th of this month and advanced towards Tangjiang Yangmeisi in separate routes. According to a recent telephone call from the front, Deputy Division Commander Mo Xide led the First Regiment of Li Zhen· the Second Regiment of Huang Zhinan's troops and had arrived at Yangmeisi, searching towards 　bu. Division Commander Li Zhenqiu· led the Third Regiment of Peng Linsheng· and the Training Regiment of Chen Wenhua's troops, also arrived at Tangjiang on the 12th, the Training Regiment heading towards Shangyou County Town, and the Third Regiment heading towards Shibatang. These two regiments have reached their destinations today (15th). As for the vicinity of Xinfeng, only a part of the Second Army of the Guangdong Army is stationed, forming a mutually supporting force with the armies of Nanxiong and Nankang, and has not yet advanced on a large scale. Each unit is temporarily handling pacification in its original station. The methods being carried out are roughly as follows: 1. Searching for remaining bandits; 2. Restoring local guard teams; 3. Opening up roads; 4. Forming food committees with various county governments; 5. Dispatching teams to protect farming; 6. Forming rural propaganda teams to make followers aware; 7. Allowing Communist bandits to start anew. It is also heard that First Army Commander Yu Hanmou, seeing that the current situation has eased, has taken the time to return to Guangzhou to discuss the current situation and the strategy for suppressing the Communist bandits in eastern Jiangxi with Chen Jitang. In recent days, Chen Jitang has invited the generals of the Fourth Group Army to hold successive military conferences, which Li Zongren and others also attended. According to what is known outside, the main goals of the meeting are roughly as follows: (1) Guangdong Province and the Fourth Group Army plan to first recover the three southern counties of Jiangxi (i.e., Longnan, Dingnan, and Qiannan), and then advance to conquer Anyuan and Yudu. (2) Fujian Province, the 19th Route Army will divide into two routes, one from Hexi to Xunwu, to contact and advance with the Guangdong border and the First Independent Division of Huang Renhuan's troops stationed in Shanghang, Fujian, and the other directly from Longyan to Changting, to Shicheng, to attack the rear of the Communist bandits' lair. (3) Jiangxi Province, He Yingqin has been telegraphed from here to order the troops of Mao Bingwen, Xu Kexiang, Li Yunjie, etc., stationed in the Nanfeng area to advance south to Guangchang, directly approaching Ningdu. To the west of Jiangxi, Chen Cheng's division is advancing east from Ganzhou, cooperating with various armies to encircle the Communist bandits' lair in eastern Jiangxi. The above plan will be implemented after the Southwest Bandit Suppression Conference is held again to make a decision. It is expected that Bai Chongxi will arrive tomorrow (16th), and Cai Tingkai of the 19th Route Army in Fujian Province also plans to send representative Zhao Yi to Guangdong to discuss everything so that a complete plan for suppressing the Communist bandits in various provinces can be formulated in the short term.

<h3 id="e68">The Course of Suppressing Bandits in Eastern Hubei <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>▲ Important Passes in Northeastern Hubei Are Recovered One by One</p>
<p>▲ Post-Disaster Relief in Huang'an County Needs to be Organized Urgently</p>
<p>A communication from Hankou states that eastern Hubei is where the main force of the Red Army is located, with the 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th, 73rd, and Independent First Divisions, along with the Red Guards, claiming to have more than 50,000 people. Their lairs are in Qiliping, Huang'an, and other places, with Hekou Town, Lvwangcheng, and Huangpi Station as their forward bases. They attempted to cut off the southern section of the Pinghan Railway with a small number of troops, while the majority would occupy Macheng, Songbu, and Huangpi to advance on Wuhan. The bloody battle of Huangpi in early January, the long siege of Macheng in July, and the repeated destruction of the Pinghan Railway were all carried out according to this plan. Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek therefore adopted an effective steady approach, using the 30th and 31st Divisions of Zhang Yinxiang's army and the division of Hao Mengling to firmly defend the area from Macheng to Huangpi. He also deployed heavy troops from Chen Jicheng and Wei Lihuang on the east side of the Pinghan Railway, forming an arc-shaped encirclement line against the bandits in the Huang'an and Qiliping areas. Once the deployment was complete, the general offensive began on the 9th of this month. At that time, Liu Zhi, the Pacification Director stationed in Henan, sent troops from Zhang Fang and Ma Hongkui to attack and advance towards Bopi River, Dongxin Township, and Shuangchang Township, successively occupying various places and posing a major threat to the Red bandits. On the first day of the general offensive, Chen Jicheng's troops advanced south from Xuanhuadian, and Wei Lihuang's troops advanced from the original Chen location to Cai Town, Xia Town, and Changxingling, bandit gangs occupying Hekou Town Huangpi Station were panicked to see the national army advancing step by step. Wei and Chen's troops launched a fierce attack on the second day. Wei's troops divided into three routes, one via Yaojiaji, one via Liujiaji, Si Gu Dun, and one via Cai Town, advancing towards Hekou Town. The bandits were besieged on three sides and collapsed one after another. In this battle, more than 3,000 bandits were killed and even more were captured. During the fierce battle, the bandits hiding in the northeast team of Hekou Town hoped to come to support. The government troops took advantage of their unpreparedness and launched a pincer attack, almost annihilating the bandits. The remaining bandits fled back to Huang'an and continued to make a final struggle in the area from Liangtinggang to Dongyuemiao. Wei's troops occupied Hekou Town and pursued the victory. On the afternoon of the 12th, they separately occupied all the highlands in the areas of Luojiazai, Liangtingguan, Banbiandian, and Hongdian outside Huang'an city. On the morning of the 13th, the troops worked together to attack the city. The city hills and important passes were successively destroyed by artillery fire. The bandits had no will to fight due to excessive casualties. The various armies still attacked bravely. At 2 p.m., the north gate was broken by Li Mo'an's division of Wei's troops. For a time, the order in the city was in chaos, and the remaining bandits fled out of the city in embarrassment and retreated to the northeast. In this battle, thousands of bandits were captured and countless military supplies were seized. When Wei's troops besieged Huang'an, Chen Jicheng's troops successively occupied Huangpi Station, Lvwangcheng, Huajiahe, Tushahe, Guojia Xin Township and other places, encircling and suppressing the bandit lairs in Qiliping. After Huang'an was captured, morale was boosted. On the 13th, Chen's troops made contact with the bandits. After a fierce battle that lasted for a day and night, the Red bandits suffered extremely heavy losses. On the 14th, Li Yutang's division of Chen's troops was the first to attack the bandit lair in Qiliping. The remaining bandits hid in the northeastern highlands. Chen's troops are currently searching and will be able to resolve the situation within days. Huang'an, Qiliping, and Hekou Town are all important areas in northeastern Hubei. They fell into the hands of the bandits for eight months. The defensive works were arranged very strictly. This time, the government troops attacked and successively recovered them in just a few days. Tens of thousands of bandits collapsed in an instant, which was truly unexpected. After receiving the report, Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek immediately sent a telegram to the various armies, encouraging them to continue to fight and stating that the Red bandits were definitely not a strong enemy and that they could defeat the many with the few and win more with less. The original telegram briefly stated that this time, in the recovery of Huang'an, our Sixth Column broke the definite report of tens of thousands of troops in front of us. It was the 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th and other divisions of the bandits, as well as the First Independent Division, and an unidentified division, a total of seven divisions, as well as the Red Guards, independent regiments, battalions, etc., totaling no less than 60,000 people. Their 11th Division, known as the Iron Army, has been almost completely wiped out by us. A total of more than 18,000 bandits were killed or wounded. At that time, the puppet government forced the Huang'an County town to send two able-bodied men from each household to carry the dead and wounded. Now, north and south of Dongyuemiao, as far as Huang'an County, corpses are still lying everywhere. This shows that the bandits are definitely not a strong enemy. As long as we can fight, we can defeat the many with the few and win more with less. I hope that everyone will work hard to completely eliminate the ugly creatures and achieve complete success, etc. The post-disaster relief in Huang'an needs to be organized urgently. The fellow villagers association of the county has specially presented it to the Pacification Office, requesting a huge amount of money to be allocated for immediate relief. The original presentation described the sufferings of the people of Huang'an, which were unbearable to hear, and is recorded as follows: "Your county, Huang'an, has been ravaged by the Communist bandits since the 16th year of the Republic of China. The authorities have repeatedly sent troops to suppress them, but the bandit forces have become more and more rampant day by day, and they have finally grown in size. The county seat has fallen into the bandit lair, and the four townships have become red zones. The rural economy has been completely destroyed, and social ethics have been completely destroyed. The old and weak have been poisoned by them, and the strong have been sacrificed by them. Farm implements have been cast into spears and halberds, and cattle have been used as food. Even the thatched huts have been reduced to ashes. The beautiful fields have been reduced to overgrown weeds. The remains of the dead are abandoned in barren hills, and the survivors have moved away and are lingering. The wilderness is desolate, and the sound of chickens and dogs cannot be heard. The thousands of villages are dim, and only the traces of rats and foxes remain. The severity of the disaster is not only the crown of our Hubei, but also an unprecedented catastrophe and a tragedy that the world has never experienced. Now that the large army is encircling and suppressing them, the bandit disaster will be quelled in a matter of days. However, in the recovered area, there is no grain left, and the source of life has been cut off. If we do not urgently raise a huge amount of money to provide relief on the ground, what will the children and grandchildren be entrusted to? We have always relied on Your Excellency to be concerned about our sufferings, to care about our hunger and drowning, and to have special pity for these refugees. We respectfully request that you quickly allocate a huge amount of money to provide timely relief, to cleanse the wounds on the people's bodies, and to enable them to ascend to the spring terrace and the summer house together. We also request that you select and dispatch competent personnel to distribute the money quickly. We sincerely beg for your mercy and await your orders with trepidation." (August 16th)</p>
<h3 id="e69">The Sixth Day of the Continued Trial of the Noulens Case (Continued) <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>▲ Noulens Roars in Court and is Ordered to Leave the Court</p>
<p>▲ The Prosecutor Reports on the Progress of the Case</p>
<p>▲ The Debate Ends and the Verdict is Scheduled for the 19th</p>
<p>At the same time, a note written in French was found on the desk, meaning "I will come again at 2:30 this afternoon." So, the Western police waited in the room. At that time, a woman, namely Wang Deli, used a key to open the door from the outside and came in. When she saw two strangers, she said that she had come to the wrong place and asked if she knew Noulens. She did not answer. A receipt was found in her handbag, knowing that she lived at No. 745 Huayuan Road, Hongkou. The Western police went there to search, and found a clue from a garden entrance ticket, and cracked the case at No. 66 Hede Road, where many bank savings books were found, totaling 47,000 yuan deposited in various banks, all in the names of Chinese people. At the same time, Chinese and Western seals were also found to withdraw the deposits. This deposit was used by Noulens to direct the Red Army in various places, but this is only part of it. Based on the documents and deposits found, it is determined that Noulens' purpose in harming the Republic of China also has the following proofs: (1) A person who looks after the house and a rent collector have proved in the High Court that Noulens is the guest living in Room 30, Block C, No. 49 Nanjing Road. (2) Since Noulens knew that there was U.S. dollars in the steel box, the documents in the steel box must be Noulens'. (3) The handwriting of Noulens' letter to the Meifeng Bank has been identified by the appraiser of the police station as being consistent with the other two documents. (4) Xiang Zhongfa, the leader of the Communist bandits, once confessed that the Far East Director of the Third International was Noulens, also known as Lao Maozi and Ainase, which shows that these are all his aliases. Even if Ainase is another person, why doesn't Noulens point it out? (5) Noulens said that he was a teacher in Shanghai. How could a teacher have so much money, and why would he have wireless registration in four places and eight post office boxes? (6) The Far East Director includes Japan, Annam, Saigon, and other parts. The scope is even larger than the Chinese Director. The purpose is to instigate farmers and workers to organize the Red Army, provide funds, and destroy our country's political organization. Based on the above points, there is no doubt that he has committed the crime of harming the Republic of China. As for Wang Deli, a document typed in English with handwritten additions was also found. The handwriting is the same as the handwriting left in Room 30, Block C, No. 49 Nanjing Road. Her purpose is the same as Noulens'. Regardless of whether they are husband and wife, she and Noulens have the same purpose. Xiang Zhongfa once confessed that Noulens' wife is very powerful, but they are not really husband and wife. They were sent by the Third International to monitor Noulens' work. If Wang had no close relationship with Noulens, why would so many important documents in Noulens' room not be kept secret from her, and why would she be allowed to enter and leave freely, and why would she have the same key? When Wang was arrested, she stated that she had gone to the wrong place and did not know Noulens. Why does she now say that they are husband and wife? By analogy, it can be seen that her work is Noulens' work, and there is no doubt that she is an accomplice. Therefore, she should be prosecuted together in accordance with Articles 1, 2, 5, and 6 of the Emergency Law for the Punishment of Crimes Endangering the Republic of China. However, whether the amnesty case regulations should be applied to reduce her sentence should be decided by the presiding judge. After the prosecutor's argument was completed, the presiding judge asked the lawyer Chen Ying if there was a debate. Chen replied that before the evidence is fully verified, the order is first the prosecutor's argument, then the defendant's statement, and then the lawyer's defense. Now the defendant has not yet made a statement, and the elected lawyer has not obtained the defendant's opinion, so he cannot defend immediately. (Question) The defendant is making a lot of noise in court today, so according to Article 61 of the Court Organization Law, he is ordered to leave the court because the defendant is not obeying the order. (Answer) The lawyer declares doubt about Article 299 of the Criminal Procedure Law and asks for a ruling first. (Question) This court has the right to order him to leave the court for violating Articles 61 and 62 of the Court Organization Law and violating the order, and according to Article 63, no appeal is allowed. (Answer) Now the lawyer is ordered to defend. Please ask whether the order is based on the qualification of election or designation. (Question) Noulens asked you to defend him, and today he added a signature to your letter of commission in court, so of course it is the qualification of election. (Answer) The defendant is accused of endangering the Republic of China, a crime punishable by death. If there is any doubt, please ask the presiding judge to rule on the necessity first.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Westward Journey (II) <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>▲Shaanxi Only Lacks a Little Water</p>
<p>After a sudden clearing of heavy rain, a constant cool breeze blew, and the pleasure we felt greatly increased our spirit to move forward. On the afternoon of the 11th, at 5:00 PM, everyone hurriedly packed their luggage and handed it over to the Longhai Railway authorities, asking porters to load it onto the train. After a boisterous half-hour, we split up into rickshaws, racing each other straight to the station.</p>
<p>We are ashamed—we are truly very ashamed, because we have unconsciously become slightly tainted with the colors of the aristocracy and the spirit of imperialism. When we arrived at the station, there were already many people holding flags filled with various slogans, coming to see us off. After I boarded the train, I learned that this was a special train prepared for us by the Longhai Railway, and the decorations and furnishings were very beautiful and comfortable. After the train departed at 6:15 PM, we arrived at Sishui at 7:47 PM that evening, Luoyang at 10:21 PM, Xin'an at 11:43 PM, Mianchi at 1:40 AM in the middle of the night, Guanyintang at 2:37 AM, and Shanzhou at 4:36 AM. On the 12th, at 5:46 AM at dawn, we arrived at Lingbao, and Tongguan at 9:47 AM. Along the way, at each station, there were armed comrades with unusually neat uniforms, saluting us and putting on a big show, playing military music for us. I carefully observed that what we encountered seemed to be no different from the airs of the League of Nations investigation team when they were observing in various parts of China. Our hearts were therefore deeply troubled.</p>
<p>When the train sped westward from Zheng, although it was dusk with dim clouds, and the night was gradually enveloping the surrounding earth, everyone was still excitedly watching the scenery outside the window. However, the same scenery was observed differently by each person. For example, when the train was traveling, everyone saw the distinctly independent yellow earth cliffs outside the train, of varying heights. Mr. Shen Yiqian, an artist, praised its unique scenery, saying it was worthy of sketching. Mr. Liu Zhonghe, a soil scientist, paid attention to the soil composition, believing it to be very fertile. Others took out ancient versions of Tang poems to verify historical sites in the field. It can be seen that the feelings, research, and future influences that arise from the same object vary from person to person.</p>
<p>From Zheng to Tongguan in the west, the abundance of historical sites is too numerous to recount. Twenty-two li north of the Tielu Station is the Zhou Ke Tomb, where Zhou Ke, the imperial censor of the Han Dynasty, and Ji Xin jointly defended Xingyang. When the city was broken, they were captured by Xiang Yu, and died unyielding. Thirty li south of Xingyang Station is the ancient city where Duke Zhuang of Zheng enfeoffed Duan. Sishui County, two li southeast of Sishui Station, is the Hulao Pass of Wei, which holds a very important place in ancient history. More than ten li south of Heishi Pass are the mausoleums of the emperors and empresses of the Song Dynasty. Eight li east of the station is said to be the Zhao Jin Tomb, nine li from the station is the Kou Laigong Tomb, and twelve li south of the station is the Bao Zheng Tomb. On the roadside south of Yanshi Station are the tombs of Boyi and Shuqi, and five li west of the station is the tomb of Yi Yin. More than ten li west of Yijingpu Station are the mausoleums of the emperors of the Han and Tang Dynasties. Luoyang was the ancient capital of the Zhou and Han dynasties. In the southwest of the city is the Zhougong Temple, and near the Baima Temple is the Di Liangong Tomb. Forty li southeast is the Fan Wenzhenggong Tomb, and the Shao Kangjie Ancestral Hall, the Er Cheng Xianxing Ancestral Hall, and the Guan Gong Tomb, etc. In addition, Mianchi was the place where ancient strategists used troops the most. Southwest of Lingbin City is the Guan Longfeng Tomb, and to its south is the Hangu Pass, where Laozi crossed westward. Tongguan spans the Elephant Mountain in the west and the Qilin Mountain in the southeast, with majestic terrain and many historical sites. The purpose of our westward journey this time is not to study antiques, but to conduct on-the-spot investigations of Shaanxi's industries using scientific methods, so we only describe the essentials.</p>
<p>Around 9:00 AM on the 12th, before we arrived at Tongguan, the Shaanxi Provincial Government had already sent Representative Xu and others to board the train to transport us to more than ten long-distance buses that had been prepared to transport us to Xi'an. Around 10:30 AM, we departed from Tongguan, with the South Route Director Hu Shuhua, Deputy Director Zhao Guobin, Doctor Ye Jingxun, Clerks Xiao Xinwu and Xu Hongling, North Route Director Hu Boyuyuan, Deputy Directors Ma Jin and Liu Chenghou, Doctor Qin Enfu, and Clerks Ou Zhaobang, Yu Zhonggang, and Liao Zhengmiao, each leading all the members, departing in buses. The trip was about six hours, said to be about two hundred and ten li long. The bus road was all dirt road. After driving for two hours, dust billowed, and we could not recognize each other's faces in the car. People sat in the car as if in a stormy sea, bumping and jumping violently. It was better later. After passing Weinan, we felt very uncomfortable because we were covered in dust. We ordered the drivers to stop by the road one after another and went to Huaqing Pool for a bath. There were three pools, two large and one small. When we washed our feet, we silently recited the line "The cold weather grants a bath in Huaqing, beginning a new reception of grace," and could not help but feel relaxed. Around 6:00 PM, we finally arrived in Xi'an. The South Group stayed at the Chang'an Apartment, and the North Group stayed at the Northwest Hotel. The scheduled itinerary is to depart from Xi'an for inspection on the 15th.</p>
<p>On the road west of Tongguan, we only saw yellow earth on both sides, with sparse organisms. Due to the lack of water, the products in the fields were greatly affected. Shaanxi is a fertile land, but it only lacks a little water, almost leading to thousands of miles of red land and people living in misery. If anyone wants to seek the rapid progress of Shaanxi's agriculture in the future, the first step must be to make efforts to think about irrigation. (To be continued)</p>

<p>▲District Bureau Agrees to Dredge the City River</p>
<p>Previously, the First District Office received instructions from the county government, based on the approval of the county party headquarters meeting, that the city river was silted up and the water flow was polluted, which hindered simple life. Please instruct the Public Security and Construction Bureaus of the First District Office to discuss appropriate measures together. The district convened the Public Security and Construction Bureaus, including Shen Jingyu and Dao Yi, on this day (18th) to discuss solutions. It was decided to divide the measures into two types: active and passive. Passive measures: (A) The Public Security Bureau issues a notice prohibiting the dumping of dirty debris into the river, with penalties for violators, and adds patrol boats to inspect the river at any time. If it is found that someone is dumping dirt into the river, the police will arrest and punish them. (B) The district office sends letters to the township chiefs and police to persuade households not to dump dirty debris into the river. Active measures: First, the Construction Bureau sends personnel to measure the riverbed, estimate the earthwork, and prepare a budget, which is submitted to the county government for approval. Then, local people are hired to organize a committee to discuss the implementation. In addition, the Director of the Public Security Bureau proposed to investigate the city's riverbank, where dung tanks are densely lined up, which hinders drinking water. How should this be banned? It was decided that since the dung tanks are set up in low places, which easily get water, it is necessary to prevent drinking water. Each household should raise the original dung tank and the dung outlet stone hole by two feet, and cover them to emphasize hygiene. The Public Security Bureau will issue a notice on these measures, and the district office will instruct the township police to persuade households. In addition, the Director of the Public Security Bureau proposed that citizen Cai Guanghui requested a strict ban on coarse paper production, using rice straw as raw material to wash in the river. How should this be banned? It was decided that since coarse paper production uses rice straw as raw material and washes it in the river, it is indeed easy to make the river turbid and hinder hygiene. The Public Security Bureau should investigate according to the previous proposal and report it to the county government, which will instruct the Second District Chief to report the location in detail, so that they can be ordered to move.</p>

<p>▲Wuxian Jingbao is Repeatedly Accused</p>
<p>The Wuxian Jingbao, a tri-daily newspaper founded by Wuxian resident Wu Guoxiong, has recently been sued by Ms. Zhu Xiuwen and Yu Yu Ru, etc., who first filed a private prosecution with the local court, accusing the newspaper's director, Wu Guoxiong, and editor, Zhang Mengjuan, of defamation. The local court summoned the plaintiffs and defendants in both cases on the 18th, and after separate hearings, advised them to try to reconcile first. If reconciliation fails, the trial will be held again. In addition, Wang Jiading accused the newspaper of continuously publishing obscene words, which harmed social morals, and submitted a report to the county government to ban the newspaper. After receiving the report, the county government is conducting a thorough investigation.</p>
<p>▲Reorganization of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association</p>
<p>The Wuxian Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association had a major corruption case. The county party headquarters ordered the association to stop working and arrested the association's president, Huang Zixin, who has been sent to the local court for interrogation. The county party headquarters believes that the anti-Japanese work cannot be stopped during this anti-Japanese period, so it convened representatives of various legal groups to hold a meeting and re-elect members of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association. It was decided on the spot to appoint the Chamber of Commerce, the Trade Union, and the Education Association as standing committee members. The Anti-Japanese Association was taken over on the 18th and work began immediately.</p>

<p>▲Patriotic Groups are Established One After Another</p>
<p>The patriotic groups that have been established in this county include the National Salvation and Traitor Elimination Group and the Blood Soul Traitor Killing Group. Details have been recorded in previous reports. It is now known that the Youth Dare-to-Die Group and the Blood Soul Traitor Elimination Group's Taicang branch have also been established. The other day, Yuanchang Silk Shop and Wanhexian South Goods Shop received a serious warning from the Youth Dare-to-Die Group, which stated that your shop had privately imported enemy goods, which has been confirmed by our group's investigation. Considering that this is your first offense, we are issuing a serious warning and attaching two handgun bullets. The Taicang branch of the Blood Soul Traitor Elimination Group announced to all sectors yesterday that they received a letter from the Youth Dare-to-Die Group, stating that there are ignorant traitorous merchants who buy and sell enemy goods. Our group was deeply saddened after receiving the letter and has sent personnel to Taicang to investigate, as a warning to the traitors.</p>

<p>▲Private Production of Inferior Silkworm Seeds Exposed</p>
<p>The only sideline of the rural villages in our county is mulberry planting and silkworm breeding. Therefore, silkworm seed production farms are everywhere in the city and countryside. However, some people who are blinded by profit see the advantages of seed production and start privately producing inferior seeds with fake brands for sale. This is not uncommon. Recently, Hu Jigao, the town chief of the Fifth Town of the First District, combined with Ni Yunqing, Zhu Ruopeng, etc., using the Yong Sheng Seed Production Farm's horse brand trademark, privately produced inferior seeds and sold them at the Shanghai Hotel on Tongyun Road, making a lot of profit. Recently, the Yong Sheng Farm found out and immediately reported to the Silkworm Industry Control Office, requesting that personnel be sent to thoroughly investigate. After receiving the report, Director Ni immediately sent staff members Ye Jingfeng and Shan Dinghaiping to rush to the scene and seized 660 fake seed sheets, and arrested Zhu Ruopeng and sent him to the Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau. Director Hua immediately sent police to arrest Ni Yunqing and Hu Jixian and bring them to the bureau, and sent a document to the county government. Chief Wang opened the court for interrogation and ordered Ni Yunqing to be detained, and Hu Jishang and Zhu Ruopeng to be released on bail pending trial.</p>
<p>▲A Young Girl's Breasts Grow Two Feet Long</p>
<p>Li Cuizhen, a seventeen-year-old girl from the northern countryside of the county, suddenly developed unusually large breasts during puberty. At first, she kept it a secret due to shyness, but unexpectedly, they gradually expanded, and her breasts drooped. Although there was no pain or itching, they were about two feet long, more than twenty times larger than the breasts of ordinary women, which was very burdensome and inconvenient. She came to the city yesterday to seek treatment from Wang Haitao, a Western doctor on Lianyuan Street in the city. After diagnosis by Dr. Wang, it was found that she had excessively long mammary glands, which were difficult to treat. If surgery was used to cut them off, the incision would be too large and there would be many dangers. Moreover, this disease is rare in the medical field, so he did not treat her at that time and she left. Afterwards, Mr. Wang specially imitated the European and American joint research model and informed Western doctors Li Keluo, Zhu Pinshan, and Zhu Daozhou in the county to discuss medical theory in order to adopt appropriate treatment methods. At the same time, Chinese medicine doctors Zhang Zimin, Gao Shiliang, Zhou Jingshou, and Deng Yinqing heard about this and also searched through ancient and modern medical books for discussion.</p>

<p>▲Provincial Commissioner Comes to Changzhou to Clear Rent</p>
<p>After the war in Shanghai, the Wu County Government was ordered to collect rent to provide relief. Recently, the Department of Finance believed that the Wu County rent matters had not been resolved, so it specially sent Commissioner Hou Shanzhong to Changzhou on the 17th to handle the clearance of rent matters and limited it to the end of this month. Commissioner Hou is currently in contact with County Magistrate Zhang to discuss everything.</p>
<p>▲County Magistrate Zhang Severely Punishes the Police for Facilitating Smuggling</p>
<p>County Magistrate Zhang of Wu ordered the Public Security Bureau to send personnel to the police team to go to Nan Zhai Town to investigate and seize the Shouwan machinery. Zeng Du, nicknamed Mei Lanfang's mother, was arrested, but the principal and important documents had escaped with money in advance. After investigation, it was found that Yu Jinrong, a police officer in charge of facilitating smuggling, had gone to the countryside to inform in advance. County Magistrate Zhang was furious when he heard the news, and summoned the government police and detective team on the 17th to give a speech and limited them to three hours to hand over Yu Jinrong. He was subsequently arrested and sent to the court for interrogation.</p>

<p>▲Robbery of Earth Occurs at the South Gate</p>
<p>Shao Nangang, the current manager of the Southern Inn outside Xian Gate, prepared two packages of opium, weighing 24 taels, for his master Jin Jianxin to smoke the other day. Unexpectedly, Wang Ziqiang, the assistant of the shop, had some opinions with Shao. The other day, a huge amount of money was missing from the account, suspected to have been embezzled by Shao, so he negotiated with him. In fact, this money was taken by the shop owner Jin Jianxin. Shao resented being wronged and took the earth out. Wang suspected that he was going to report to the bureau, so he rushed up to stop him and tried to snatch the opium in his hand. During a scuffle, one package suddenly fell to the ground. It happened to be seen by the nearby police officer, who twisted Shao. Wang saw that the situation was not good, picked up one package and fled into the inn. Shao Nangang could not get rid of the package in his hand. In a moment of desperation, he saw a vendor selling sugar taro on the street, and threw the package of earth into the sugar taro pot. The police officer fished in the pot and found a package of opium (some say it was flower paste). He was about to take it back to the bureau to report when a hooligan named Xu Gengsheng suddenly came and slapped the small package of opium out of the police officer's hand and fled into the inn. At that time, the police officer only had a corner of the package paper in his hand, with a little paste stain. He rushed into the inn and arrested Xu Gengsheng and took him to the Second Police Station of the Public Security Bureau. As a result, he was released on bail. Soon, many hooligans surrounded the entrance of the Southern Inn, clamoring for a reward. The inn gave them seven or eight yuan to disperse. Unexpectedly, someone secretly reported to the Public Security Bureau, saying that the patrol officer of the Second Station was suspected of colluding. Director Yin immediately telegraphed to inquire about the patrol officer Fang Desheng in charge. Fang had no choice but to summon a group of witnesses and send them to the Bureau. On the 16th, they were transferred to the County Justice Department. After interrogation by Examiner Chai, Patrolman Shen Peng (the original detective) suddenly changed his testimony, with words that were mostly in favor of the defendant. The report of the station also stated that Wang and Shao were colleagues, and this was entirely caused by a joke and there was no opium. However, the County Justice Department believed that this case was important and immediately detained the robber Xu Gengsheng for investigation and further verification. The Public Security Bureau has repeatedly had major cases in the Second Station where Patrolman Fang failed to report (two people drowned in the previous dragon boat race, and Fang's handling before and after was improper). Now that this has happened again, there will be severe punishment to show punishment. Alas, the prevalence of opium and the unbridled hooligans in Changshu can be seen from this.</p>
<p>▲Education Funds are Not Available, Schools Temporarily Postpone Classes</p>
<p>The education funds of this county have been in arrears for more than six months during the tenure of Director Gao Tinggui in the last semester. Later, the Department of Education appointed Zhou Fengjing to Changshu to take over. The education sector immediately inquired about the education funds. According to his statement, the arrears before June (i.e., during Gao's tenure) are old debts and will be planned to be repaid in installments. After June, the new director will be responsible for clearing them monthly without any more arrears. Therefore, the people in the education sector were very happy. Unexpectedly, after Zhou came to Changshu, only one term of funds for June was issued, and there was no guarantee for the funds for July. The future is bleak. Moreover, the newly appointed principals are required to clear all new and old debts for those who have resigned. However, the bureau has no funds at all. For example, the county middle school, rural normal school, and the principals of various primary schools have all been appointed, so they have not been able to take over. According to the intentions of the general primary school principals, since the new Director Zhou has expressed that he will not be in arrears, the education funds for July should be issued immediately, otherwise the classes will be temporarily postponed this year to avoid being burdened. According to the news from the Education Bureau, the urgently needed funds are: the first batch is more than 5,800 yuan in arrears for the county middle school, the second batch is more than 3,700 yuan in arrears to repay the rural teachers, the third batch is about 10,000 yuan in arrears for changing various schools, and the fourth batch is more than 20,000 yuan in recurring expenses for July, totaling more than 40,000 yuan. Director Zhou has been very busy contacting people these days. It is said that he has a guarantee for the first batch, but he has no way to deal with the others. However, not only the Director of the Education Bureau should be responsible for these funds, but also the County Magistrate. Now only the county middle school has a way to deal with the arrears, while other schools have no way to deal with it. How can this be called fair?</p>

<p>The Reasons and Hopes for Convening a National Sports Conference Amid National Crisis: Zhong Lingxiu</p>
<p>The clamor for the preparation of the National Sports Conference has been intermittent for several years, but no actual opening had been seen. Unexpectedly, amidst this national crisis, the formal convening of the conference suddenly took place, like a bolt from the blue, invigorating people's spirits. It is indeed a most gratifying event for the future of national sports. However, upon closer reflection, why is the sports conference not held in times of peace and tranquility, but suddenly held when the nation is in dire straits? This is quite thought-provoking. After repeated investigation, I have gained some insight into the reasons.</p>
<p>Throughout our country's history in Asia, for thousands of years, "refined and cultured" has been regarded as the highest elegance. Coupled with unhealthy habits and a lack of attention to hygiene, people have become sallow and weak, and their spirits are depressed. Foreigners mock us as "sick men of East Asia," which is not entirely unjustified. When the imperial examination system was abolished and schools were established, the educational purpose included "promoting martial spirit," and the curriculum included "gymnastics." However, this was merely seen as imitating Europe, America, and Japan, and as a decoration to the curriculum. Emphasizing sports in name only is like "looking from outside the palace walls," without any practical benefit. After the founding of the Republic of China, schools at all levels began to pay some attention. In the past decade, although there has been some progress, the government has never had active and concrete proposals, and social perceptions are often narrow and superficial. Therefore, our country's sports have had no systematic structure, system, or consistent spirit in the past. New trends focus on ball games and track and field, with competition becoming frenzied and increasingly resembling the commercialization of sports in Europe and America. Old traditions emphasize national martial arts, sticking to old ways and unwilling to start research from a scientific perspective to seek fundamental and rational improvements. Superficially, domestic sports today seem to be slightly more vibrant and have made some progress compared to the past. However, compared with the organized and targeted promotion of sports in Europe, America, and Japan, the difference is as vast as the heavens. Other countries consider the development of national sports to be the foundation of all kinds of education, while our country regards it as an appendage to education. Other countries consider the training of national sports to be the driving force for increasing production efficiency, while our country regards it as a negligible activity. Other countries' sports are planned, targeted, orderly, unified, and spiritually focused, while ours are chaotic, disorganized, and each goes its own way. Therefore, others can be healthy, strong, resilient, capable, and far-reaching, while we are physically weak and cannot withstand complexity. In contrast, in terms of international competition, the outcome is clear. Victory or defeat is not determined solely on the battlefield but is practically demonstrated and verified. As the saying goes, "Spirit is the mother of enterprise," and "A strong spirit resides in a strong body." To put it another way, to have a strong spirit, one must have a strong body, and with a strong spirit, one can achieve great undertakings. Now, our country, as a nation with weak physical strength, wants to establish itself in the world of the 20th century and compete with the great powers for victory. How can we not encounter failures and lag behind in everything? Now that the country is in trouble and foreign aggression is frequent, let us think, "A person must first insult himself before others insult him." The arrival of foreign aggression is not only due to political, economic, and scientific inferiority but also because the people's physical strength is weak, their spirits are depressed, their morale is low, they lack perseverance, and they lack unity. This is one of the main reasons for attracting foreign aggression. Since the September 18th Incident, the Chinese people have wondered how a nation of only 60 million Japanese people could dare to invade our dignified Chinese nation of 400 million people. Even if we are seven against one, and final victory, no matter what, belongs to us in our hearts, we still seem to be "indifferent" to the disaster. It must be understood that if people who are physically weak, untrained, and unprepared compete with people who are physically strong, trained, and prepared, no matter how many there are, what is the point? This is something that the people of the country must deeply awaken to. The government authorities, aware of this, believe that the weakness of the people's physical strength and the depression of their spirits are the root cause of attracting foreign aggression in the near future and the root cause of a weak race and a weak country in the long run. Therefore, when the country is in dire straits and the national treasury is strained, it does not hesitate to raise huge sums of money to hold a national sports conference, bringing together sports experts from all over the country to discuss the direction and implementation steps of national sports in the future, as a good way to save the national crisis. This will give national sports in the future a plan, a goal, an organization, an opportunity for common development, and a direction for overall training. The entire nation will strive to exercise, strengthen their bodies, and protect the country and defend the people under a unified goal, to seek revenge and wipe out the humiliation, to resist foreign aggression, and to resolve the national crisis and stabilize the country. This is the fundamental purpose of convening the National Sports Conference amidst national crisis, which I believe is understood by all the participants. I respectfully hope that all the participants will express their great opinions and carefully discuss how to develop national sports, promote national spirit, resolve the national crisis, and save the national crisis as their duty. Weigh the world situation, consider the national conditions, formulate good plans, and ensure that the conference is held, discussions are made, decisions are made, decisions are implemented, and implementation is widespread. In a few years, the achievements of all the participants will spread throughout the country and resonate at home and abroad. This is what we sincerely pray for and what the people of the whole country earnestly hope for.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 18th Telegram. In addition to the target, which has already been resolved by the general assembly, all other groups held meetings in the morning and afternoon of the 18th.

<p>—Men's sports cannot be applied to women—</p>
<p>—Women's sports should be guided by women—</p>
<p>—Seek sports that are suitable for women—</p>
<p>Nanjing, 18th Telegram, Zhang Huilan, a female expert, was elected as the female representative in the program organizing committee. The reporter visited her before the meeting and selected her views on women's sports. The main points of the conversation are as follows: I participated in the meeting this time to improve the women's sports program. Some members misunderstood that I meant that sports should be divided into men and women. This is not my original intention. I think that women's sports should be stipulated within the scope of what women's body and mind can do, and cannot be based on men's perspectives. As for the meaning of sports, there are two: (1) for health, (2) for education. Health seeks universality, not competition. Using men's standards to force women to do strenuous sports competitions will hinder the development of women's physiology. In terms of education, teachers and students are not only teacher-student relationships but also have the obligation of life guidance. If men are responsible for women's sports teachers, it will not only be useless but also harmful. In general, my opinions are two: (1) Stipulate the scope of sports according to women's physiology. (2) Female sports instructors are most suitable for women.</p>

<p>(A) School Physical Education</p>
<p>I. Physical Education Curriculum</p>
<p>(1) Universities: Although the university curriculum standards have not yet been promulgated by the Ministry of Education, physical education should be a required subject for all grades, and students who fail shall not be allowed to graduate.</p>

<p>(B) Mass Physical Education: Although mass physical education has been promoted for many years, it has not yet become popular. There are still few adults who have an interest in physical education and considerable skills, especially in remote towns and cities. Therefore, to promote mass physical education, one aspect should start with children, and small-scale children's playgrounds should be set up in many towns and cities. On the other hand, physical education facilities that are of interest to the public, such as stone locks and swords, should be attached to these playgrounds.</p>
<h3 id="e97">(4) Promoting and Rewarding Various Types of Physical Education Gatherings and Organizations <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Private physical education organizations in our country's society, such as the National Physical Education Advancement Association, the North China Physical Education Federation, and the Advancement Associations and Federations in major cities, all have a long history and considerable achievements. As for other sporadic competitions and sports meets, they are even more popular for a time. Although there are few physical education conferences for observing technology and research associations for studying physical education academics, they are gradually gaining momentum. On the one hand, the government should not abandon its right to supervise these organizations to improve their standards. On the other hand, it must give them considerable encouragement to strive for their universality among the people. Therefore, the government must strictly define the standards and management methods for the protection of physical education gatherings and organizations, and at the same time, it should provide considerable assistance to those who have achieved success, and find ways to enlighten those areas without such organizations. The following draft is hereby stipulated:</p>
<p>I. The organization of various sports federations, whether temporary or permanent, must meet the following standards and be filed with the competent educational authority:</p>
<p>(1) The purpose is pure and purely amateur.</p>
<p>(2) The competition must have appropriate age and gender classifications.</p>
<p>(3) The responsible organizers must have served in the physical education field for more than two years and have considerable achievements.</p>
<p>(4) The participating units are definitely representatives of educational or vocational institutions and are not engaged in sports as a profession and do not hinder the amateur spirit.</p>
<p>(5) There is a definite budget and the income from tickets is not used to cover maintenance costs.</p>
<p>II. If the groups filed in the above paragraph continue to operate for three years and the competent educational authority considers that they have made considerable achievements, they may be given spiritual and material assistance. If, after filing, there is a violation of the above regulations, measures may be taken to ban them. The ban method shall be handled separately according to the severity of the circumstances.</p>
<p>III. Various groups for observing technology must have the following qualifications to be filed with the competent educational authority:</p>
<p>(1) All members have legitimate occupations and are not engaged in sports as a profession.</p>
<p>(2) There are physical education experts to provide guidance.</p>
<p>(3) Participation in various competitions or sports does not use ticket revenue to cover maintenance costs or be apportioned to members.</p>
<p>(4) Members only have the obligation to pay fees and do not enjoy material rights.</p>
<p>IV. If the above groups have special achievements after filing, they may be given considerable rewards. If there is a violation of the standards set in the above paragraph, the qualification of the group and all its members will be cancelled.</p>
<p>V. Groups in items (1) and (3) that have not been filed with the competent educational authority shall not participate in various gatherings and competitions organized by the educational authority and filed groups.</p>
<p>VI. Organizations whose purpose is to study physical education academics and have definite achievements may register with the educational authority in accordance with the methods for academic groups and may be given considerable subsidies.</p>
<p>VII. In areas where there are no physical education organizations, the competent educational authority shall convene people in the physical education field to promote the organization.</p>
<p>VIII. Various groups that have been filed may report to the competent educational authority in advance for review and consideration of subsidies when participating in international gatherings or sports meets.</p>
<p>IX. Various physical education groups shall not participate in political activities in the name of the group.</p>

<p>(5) Methods for Assessing Physical Education: The assessment of physical education has an opposite position to sports meets. Sports meets assess individual achievements and are only enough to promote the progress of individual achievements. Using this as a standard for judging the entire physical education of schools and the public is actually a mistake. Even using this as a tool for promotion, hoping to popularize physical education in schools and among the public is like climbing a tree to catch a fish. On the contrary, the physical education assessment is to examine the physical education achievements of all the citizens in a school or city, which can urge the progress of the physical education of the majority of the public. Using this as a means to evaluate the physical education of schools or cities is very reliable.</p>

<p>China Public School has internal complexities and frequent turmoil. The board of directors, considering the difficulty of reorganization and the lack of anyone willing to serve as principal, announced that it would temporarily suspend operations for the next semester. The disposal methods for students are divided into two categories: borrowing and transferring. Students in the third and fourth years of the university department will be issued a borrowing certificate by the school to borrow and study at other schools. In the future, after completing the credits, they will still graduate from the school. Students in the first and second grades of the university department and students in the high school department will be issued transfer certificates and transcripts, allowing students to freely transfer to other schools. As for the freshmen who did not take the entrance examination in the previous semester, they are considered borrowing students and are issued transcripts, allowing them to return to their original schools to study.</p>

<h3 id="e107">Unreasonable Interference by Japanese Consulate on People's Patriotic Movement Day <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>▲ A Written Protest Was Lodged the Day Before Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>▲ Mayor Wu Promised to Consider and Reply</p>
<p>Since the activities of the Blood Soul Eliminate Traitors Group and others in this city, the treacherous merchants who operate Japanese goods have disappeared and have asked the Japanese side for returns, resulting in a great blow to Japanese trade with China. According to the results of the investigation by the Japanese Businessmen's Association, the indirect and direct losses suffered in the recent month due to the activities of the Blood Soul Eliminate Traitors Group and others in Shanghai alone have reached about one million yuan. Therefore, representatives have been sent to the Consul-General in Shanghai, Murai, to petition, requesting that a protest be lodged with our municipal government. At the same time, a telegram was sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tokyo, requesting that direct negotiations be made with our Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On the 13th of this month, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs telegraphed the Consul-General in Shanghai, Murai, ordering him to immediately comply with the wishes of the overseas Chinese and lodge a practical protest with our municipal government to stop it. After receiving the order, Consul Murai immediately drafted a protest letter and went to the Shanghai Municipal Government in Fenglin Bridge at 4:30 pm the day before yesterday (17th) with Vice-Consul Shirai to lodge the protest with Mayor Wu in person. Mayor Wu personally extended the meeting. According to Murai, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce recently telegraphed various industry groups across the country to refuse to purchase Japanese goods, which has had a profound impact on Japan's entire trade with China. In addition, the activities of the Blood Soul Eliminate Traitors Group and others have made the people of China and Japan feel animosity. Therefore, he specially lodged a protest with your Mayor, requesting that appropriate measures be taken to stop it in order to increase friendly relations between the two countries, etc. However, Mayor Wu did not give a definite indication at that time, but promised to consider it and reply later. The two sides talked until 5:45 before dispersing.</p>
<p>▲ Mayor Wu Talks to Reporter of the Newsound Agency: According to Mayor Wu, Consul-General Murai of Japan came to the government yesterday to protest the anti-Japanese goods movement in this city. I replied at the time that if there are any irregular or illegal actions, the municipal government will take measures to stop them in accordance with the law. If it is within the reasonable scope of the people's movement, the municipal government will not be able to stop them. However, the formal reply is still under consideration. As for the people's patriotism, it must be automatic and motivated by conscience, and it must be an orderly action. Do not be motivated by emotions and only engage in empty talk, which will cause other problems and make it difficult for the government authorities, etc.</p>
<p>▲ Deputy Consul of Japan Talks to Reporter of the Times News Agency: After learning that the Japanese side had lodged a written protest with the municipal government regarding the patriotic movement of our people, he drove to the Japanese Consulate at 3 pm yesterday to inquire about everything. Deputy Consul Shirai came out to meet him. The reporter then had the following conversation with him: Reporter (Q): Yesterday (that is, the day before yesterday), your Consul went to the municipal government to protest to Mayor Wu, requesting that the activities of the Blood Soul Eliminate Traitors Group and others be stopped. Can you tell us the content of the protest letter? Shirai (A): The scope of the written protest lodged with your Shanghai Municipal Government yesterday was to request appropriate measures to stop the activities of the Blood Soul Eliminate Traitors Group. At the same time, a request was also attached to dissuade your government from the telegram issued by your Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to various industries to refuse to purchase Japanese goods, because this telegram from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce is tantamount to a fatal blow to our country's trade with your country. (Q) Did your Mayor Wu give a definite reply at that time? (A) There was no definite reply, but he promised to wait for consideration in a short period of time and then give a written reply. (Q) A Japanese newspaper in Shanghai recently published a slanderous message stating that more than 80 policemen from our side stationed at the Baziqiao in Zhabei had absconded. Our Shanghai Municipal Government has already lodged a protest with your consulate, requesting that a practical correction be made and that such incidents not occur again in the future. Has your consulate notified the newspaper to do so? (A) This matter can be said to have been resolved, because after receiving your protest, our consulate immediately notified the newspaper to follow the instructions of your municipal government. (Q) Your country's naval landing force stationed in Shanghai has repeatedly armed and crossed the border to demonstrate. Our Shanghai Municipal Government has already lodged a protest with your consulate, but we have not yet received a definite reply from your consulate. How will this matter be handled? Can you tell us? (A) This case is still under detailed investigation by our consulate. However, your protest to our consulate, stating that our landing force crossed the border to demonstrate many times, does not seem accurate. It is true that our landing force was ordered to be transferred to the area of the road built across the border on North Sichuan Road, but if it is necessary to pass through your territory, your Public Security Bureau will be formally notified in advance to avoid misunderstandings. Therefore, the protest lodged by your Shanghai Municipal Government to our consulate, even if it is a fact, cannot be called a cross-border demonstration, because our landing force headquarters had previously sent a notification to your Public Security Bureau. As for the news published in your newspaper today that our landing force is demonstrating on Zhongshan Road again, this matter is completely untrue, because a team of our landing force stationed in Shanghai was recently ordered by Commander Sugisaka to go to the Toyota Spinning Mill on Zhongshan Road to replace the soldiers stationed in the factory, which led your people to mistakenly believe that it was a cross-border demonstration. According to the armistice agreement signed between China and Japan on May 23, it was also stated that "Japanese soldiers can pass through the Chinese territory if they want to go to the Toyota Spinning Mill on Zhongshan Road." Therefore, the various sections published in your newspaper today are obviously rumors.</p>
<h3 id="e108">National Government Recognizes Chilean Government <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>▲ Sino-Chilean Trade Treaty Negotiations to Begin Next Month</p>
<p>It is recently heard that China and Chile will soon begin negotiations on a new friendly trade treaty. However, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency, believing that recognition of the new Chilean government is a prerequisite before China and Chile formally begin these negotiations, visited Mr. Fei Bailai, the Chargé d'Affaires of Chile in China, at the Chilean Legation yesterday. The details of the Chargé d'Affaires' statements are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ Recognition of the Chilean Government: According to Mr. Fei Bailai, Chargé d'Affaires and Consul-General of Chile in China, Chile has established a sound new government after a revolution. On the 8th of last month, he received instructions from the new government and immediately notified the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting recognition. On the 16th of the same month, he received a reply from Mr. Luo Wengan, Minister of Foreign Affairs of China, formally recognizing the new Chilean government and expressing that China and Chile would continue their previous friendly spirit and work to enhance the friendship between the two countries. He immediately telegraphed the report to his home government, and the entire Chilean nation expressed their deep gratitude for this.</p>
<p>▲ Negotiation of a Commercial Treaty Between the Two Countries: Mr. Fei Bailai said that the proposal for China and Chile to negotiate a commercial and friendly treaty originated in 1929. In Santiago, Chile, the Chinese Chargé d'Affaires in Chile, Mr. Zhang, contacted the Chilean government. Later, before formal negotiations could begin, Mr. Zhang was transferred to Switzerland and left Chile. Subsequently, I was ordered to come to China in the summer of last year, and the negotiation was moved to China. Last time, when Vice Minister Guo Taiqi was in Shanghai, I contacted him several times. Mr. Guo then ordered Mr. Zhang Sixu, Director of the Intelligence Department, to conduct research on behalf of him. Recently, after receiving instructions from the new Chilean government, I immediately notified the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to request a scheduled formal negotiation. Later, it was stalled due to the resignation of Premier Wang of the Executive Yuan. Now that this matter is expected to be resolved, I believe the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will select an appropriate date and begin negotiations. According to observations, it is expected that it may begin around September.</p>
<p>▲ Friendly Overseas Chinese in Both Countries: The Chargé d'Affaires recalled what he told a reporter from the New Voice News Agency when he first arrived in China, saying that there are approximately 100 to 200 Chinese residing in Chile, mostly living in the southern provinces of China. Most of the Chinese who travel to Chile are scattered in the northern provinces of Chile, with a population of approximately 2,000. The overseas Chinese in both countries are friendly with the local people. The Chinese are quite settled, and the Chilean government treats them no differently than its own citizens.</p>
<p>▲ Chilean Legation to Move: The Shanghai office of the Chilean Legation and Consulate is currently located at No. 54, Sevastopulo Apartments, 131 Avenue des Soeurs. Recently, the Chargé d'Affaires decided to move to a new location at No. 400 Route Haig next Wednesday because the current location is insufficient.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Large Batch of Chinese Silk Shipped to the United States Yesterday <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>▲ More Than 700 Pieces Shipped to New York</p>
<p>▲ Artificial Silk Stagnant Due to Increased Taxes</p>
<p>Since the boom in artificial silk sales, Chinese silk exports have suffered a major blow. The European and American silk markets have been further squeezed by Japanese silk. The export volume of Huzhou silk from China has fallen sharply. Due to the sharp drop in silk prices, various silk factories have stopped work one after another. Due to cost considerations, most of the silk stored last year has not been sold, and silk merchants have suffered heavy losses. In order to rescue the silk industry and encourage exports, the central government has increased the tax rate on artificial silk on the one hand, and exempted the consolidated tax and export tax on Chinese silk on the other hand. Furthermore, it has subsidized 100 taels of silver per piece of exported silk to show its utmost effort to save the situation. Since the implementation of these measures, the American silk market has gradually become active, and large quantities of Chinese silk, which had been stagnant for more than a year, have begun to be exported, which is good news for the future of the silk industry.</p>
<p>▲ Government Relief: The Ministry of Finance, responding to the requests of various silk merchants, has noted that various factories in Shanghai have a large amount of stored silk, all of which are old goods from last year. The cost of each piece of factory silk must be between 800 and 900 taels, or even 1,000 taels. At the current market price, each piece must lose 400 or 500 taels. In order to rescue the silk industry, the Ministry of Finance ordered the Jianghai Customs to exempt the consolidated tax and export tax on all exported Chinese silk, starting from this month. The Silk Industry Relief Office established by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce is even more rewarding for Chinese silk exports, with a subsidy of 100 taels of silver per piece of Chinese silk shipped to European and American countries, in addition to tax exemption. Since the implementation of these two measures, silk merchants have benefited greatly. Selling one piece of Huzhou silk can reduce losses by 150 or 160 taels.</p>
<p>▲ 700 Pieces of Chinese Silk Shipped to the United States: Chinese silk shipments to the United States have been stagnant for nearly a year. Recently, they have gradually become active. Various silk factories in Shanghai have purchased more than 1,000 pieces of yellow and white factory silk from American merchants in recent days. Today, they began loading the President McKinley of the Great American Lines, bound for New York, USA, with approximately 700 pieces. The exported silk was declared yesterday and will be loaded onto the ship in the Huangpu River this morning. This is the first batch of Chinese silk exports that have been stalled for a year and has obtained the benefits of tax exemption and government subsidies.</p>
<p>▲ Artificial Silk Accumulation: A large amount of artificial silk has been imported in recent years, which has greatly affected domestic silk. Since the customs increased taxes, the import tax on artificial silk must be 50% of the value. On the 4th of this month, the Ministry of Finance announced new tariff regulations, and the import tax on artificial silk increased by another 30%, totaling 80% of the value. Plus an additional surcharge of 14%, the total import tax on artificial silk is 94%. Due to the sharp increase in import taxes, various Italian trading companies in Shanghai that deal in artificial silk have sent telegrams to their home countries to stop ordering. The agents of the foreign trading companies are also unwilling to pay this huge tax and have transferred large quantities of artificial silk to the customs warehouse. In recent days, the fourth and eighth customs warehouses of the Shanghai Customs have been filled with foreign artificial silk. Since August 4th, various firms in this city that deal in artificial silk have changed their methods. For those who purchase this product, they report and withdraw a certain number of pieces to the customs temporarily. In this way, they can avoid prepaying huge taxes. However, due to the accumulation in the Jianghai Customs, large quantities of this foreign artificial silk will no longer be shipped in.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Huang Tingyu Describes Improved Flying Arrow Plan <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>▲ Iron-Blooded National Salvation Army Concentrated in Kailu</p>
<p>▲ Ammunition Running Out, Hoping for Support from All Sectors</p>
<p>Huang Tingyu, the inventor of the Flying Arrow, previously came to Shanghai with Yin Kaisan, the commander-in-chief of the Northeast Iron-Blooded National Salvation Army, to test the Flying Arrow. The results were good. Mr. Huang and Mr. Yin are currently in contact with all sectors to seek assistance for the National Salvation Army's military affairs. They will not be able to return north for about a week. According to Mr. Yin, the Northeast Iron-Blooded National Salvation Army has three armies. The first army is led by General Yin Chuan and has approximately 7,000 cavalrymen. It is currently concentrated in the provinces of Rehe and Chahar, desperately starting out. A report from the army states that the Li Division of the army, with more than 2,000 soldiers, has been concentrated in Kailu. It is currently short of ammunition and will launch an attack immediately after receiving ammunition. The second army is led by Yin Yuanmin and has approximately 7,000 infantry and cavalrymen. It is currently scattered in the Haicheng, Yingkou, and Dashiqiao areas and is fighting fiercely with the enemy. The army is also running out of ammunition and urgently needs supplies. The third army is led by Zhao Dianliang and has approximately 5,000 soldiers, including an engineering regiment of approximately 1,000 soldiers, all of whom are workers from ordnance factories. It is currently stationed in the Fushun and Liaoning areas. Recently, it destroyed the Northeast General Power Plant under Japanese jurisdiction, and the Shenyang area has become a world of darkness. It is hoped that patriotic people from all walks of life will do their best to provide assistance in terms of spiritual and material support in order to resist to the end. The troops plan to concentrate in Kailu, advance towards the Datong Line, and unite with the Volunteer Army in western Liaoning, using the Haicheng, Fushun, and Haicheng units as internal support and the cavalry group as the main combat force.</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Tingyu is currently the deputy commander of the army. According to him, the improvement of the Flying Arrow is currently under active research. In the future, it is planned to have the same trajectory as the mortar. The lower part will be equipped with an elevator, the same as the anti-aircraft gun's elevator, and the middle part will be equipped with an angle machine, so that shooting at aircraft will be more accurate. The explosives used are purely self-made and do not use foreign goods. Once sufficient economic resources are available, manufacturing can begin and be distributed to various armies in the Northeast.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Correspondence Office of the Propaganda Committee of the Northeast National Salvation Army Command and Supervision received a telegram from Shanhaiguan: (1) The National Salvation Army units of Xu Guoliang and others attacked the Anshan Iron and Steel Works and the Lipou Station in two ways in the evening and morning. A large number of Japanese troops and police were dispatched to counterattack with artillery, and our army retreated, but it has already caused a great threat to the enemy. (2) The National Salvation Army unit of Jin Shanhao besieged the Japanese police station and the puppet Public Security Team in Baiqizhai, southeast of Tieling, on the morning of the new year. Japanese cavalry planes rushed to support the police after hearing the alarm, and the fighting was fierce. Details are unclear. (3) The National Salvation Army unit of Quan Guosheng is active near Tongliao, planning to find an opportunity to defeat the enemy. The detachment of Gao Pengzhen, Xin Fengxia, Shan Dou, etc., is very active in the Kangping and Zhangwu areas. The momentum of the National Salvation Army in Fengcheng and Liaoyang has been revived, and the enemies in Yingkou and Andong have become increasingly panicked and strengthened their defenses. Jin County, Yixian, Xinmin, Benxi, Fushun, etc., are still in the hands of the enemy. (17th)</p>
<h3 id="e112">Huang Zhendong and Others to Leave Shanghai Tomorrow for the North <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>▲ Grateful for Donations from All Sectors</p>
<p>Huang Zhendong and others, representatives of the Mongolian Border Cavalry Commander, came to Shanghai to seek assistance. The circumstances of the assistance from the Support Association, the First District Branch of the Chamber of Commerce, and Wang Shuntai Clothing Company, etc., have been reported in previous newspapers. According to Mr. Huang, in addition to the previous assistance, the First District Branch of the Chamber of Commerce has donated 14 military coats, 11 military trousers, 4 military hats, and 2 belts. Wang Shuntai Clothing Company has also donated 22 military coats, 10 military trousers, and 14 sets of high-quality yellow cotton military uniforms and 12 military trousers for our army. In addition, patriotic people at No. 429 Jing'an Temple Road donated 50 yuan, and the Cotton Cloth Association, which was previously solicited by the Support Association, donated 100 yuan, which has also been delivered. Our army is deeply grateful for the repeated enthusiastic donations from all sectors. If all compatriots across the country can generously donate their money in this way, why worry that the lost territories in the Northeast will not be recovered? It is also said that the army has indeed occupied Tongliao and is currently fighting desperately with the Japanese puppet troops. The soldiers at the front hope that the rear will provide supplies as quickly as possible. Therefore, Zhendong and others have decided to leave Shanghai tomorrow for the north to transport this batch of supplies to the front to boost morale. In the future, if all sectors are willing to generously assist the army with materials, economics, etc., please specify the donation to the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association for collection and forwarding, or send it directly to the army's office in Peiping at No. 2 Xueyuan Hutong, which will be very welcome.</p>

<h3 id="e122">Aviation Construction Association Seeks Cooperation Talent <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The China Aviation Construction Association recently stated that aviation construction depends on talent. However, in view of the fact that domestic aviation professionals are already as rare as morning stars, and when they gather together, they often suffer from a lack of available people, while those who have talent and are waiting for employment often suffer from not knowing where to turn. Therefore, the Association recently plans to investigate talent who have close relationships with the aviation industry from all parties, regardless of whether they are current or former pilots, mechanics, engineers, repair craftsmen, and various experts in aviation, to register them in detail so that they can be employed as much as possible when various constructions of the Association begin. At other times, they can be introduced to other places to exchange information and knowledge, and be the first step in connecting and concentrating aviation talent across the country. It is heard that applicants should fill in (1) name, (2) native place, (3) age, (4) address, (5) qualifications, (6) experience (including what work they have undertaken), where, when, and how much salary, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Public Bus Strike Workers Scheduled to Petition the Municipal Government Today <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>▲ The Crowd Was Outraged at Yesterday's General Assembly</p>
<p>▲ Traffic on Various Roads Continues to Be Disrupted</p>
<p>Since the British-owned public bus workers went on strike, a stalemate has been formed due to the company's tough attitude and the recruitment of new workers. The workers held another general assembly yesterday and decided to petition the Municipal Government this morning. If there is no solution, they will resolutely use force to prevent traffic. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Workers' General Assembly: At 2:00 p.m. yesterday, all the workers held another general assembly at a certain place on Avenue des Soeurs, with more than 200 people attending. The crowd was very outraged. The presidium reported on the progress of the contact with the Ratepayers Association and resolved: (1) All workers will wear uniforms and walk to the Municipal Government to petition on the morning of the 19th; (2) A general demonstration will be held on a scheduled date; (3) All passengers are respectfully advised not to take the public bus to avoid being affected; (4) Resolutely use force to deal with new ticket sellers.</p>
<p>▲ Presentation to the Municipal Government: The strike committee submitted a report to the Municipal Government, stating that the workers, under the oppression of imperialism, could no longer bear it. After spontaneously going on strike, repeated attempts to negotiate by sending representatives were refused. The workers are in a dilemma and their livelihoods are urgent. It is inevitable that disturbances will occur to public security. A request has been made to the Shanghai Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau to negotiate with the company, but it has not been accepted at all, so that more than 300 workers and thousands of family members have no way to rely on their lives. A general assembly was held yesterday morning, and it was decided that all the workers would petition the government and designate Shi Baoshan, Wang Xingmao, He Duanquan, and Zhang Bolin as worker representatives. They begged for sympathy for the workers' difficulties and the urgency of their livelihoods, and quickly sent officials to negotiate with the company, and it was necessary to decide on five temporary measures: (1) Immediately stop recruiting new workers; (2) Quickly restore the workers' original jobs; (3) Implement wage increases; (4) Wages during the strike period will be paid as usual; (5) No workers may be fired under any pretext. The above five items are the lowest demands of the workers. They implore the Governor to approve the acceptance in order to maintain the workers' livelihood and increase national prestige. They respectfully present with urgency and cannot wait for orders.</p>
<p>▲ Continued Disturbances: At 10:00 a.m., Route 1 public bus was driving near Avenue Haig and Route 9 was driving to Avenue Foch and other places, and striking workers threw hollowed-out watermelons filled with feces into the bus. For a time, the smell spread everywhere, and passengers suffered collateral damage. Therefore, there were few passengers on the buses in the afternoon, fearing that they would be innocently affected. When the Route 5 bus was driving on North Henan Road, it was surrounded by striking workers who beat a Russian ticket seller severely. Then Chinese police arrived, and the workers dispersed.</p>
<p>▲ Passenger Negotiations: At 10:00 a.m. yesterday, two passengers went to the Transport Office of the Headquarters of the Road Connaught Company to negotiate. According to them, they paid to take the bus, but they were thrown feces by the striking workers, which was harmful to health, and demanded compensation from the company. A certain employee of the company received them and said that the company no longer recognized the striking workers and had completely dismissed them, so the company was not responsible for anything. The passengers admitted that they were unlucky and left.</p>
<p>▲ Request for Assistance: The Strike Committee issued a declaration yesterday, requesting assistance from all sectors, saying that under the oppression of imperialism, they endured and served painfully, but were unreasonably dismissed. The workers' livelihoods are difficult, and the strike time may not be resolved for a while. They requested economic and material assistance from all sectors. The workers are very grateful.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Part of the Sanyou Factory Workers Have Been on Hunger Strike Since Yesterday <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>▲ Another Crying Appeal Group Formed to Appeal to Various Organizations</p>
<p>The shutdown dispute at the Sanyou Industrial Corporation's main factory in Yinxiang Port has been ongoing for over half a year without resolution. The workers have repeatedly appealed until their voices are hoarse. Consequently, they have organized a hunger strike group as a final plea. Starting yesterday, twenty-three members of the group have been on hunger strike to awaken the capitalists. Simultaneously, a crying appeal group has been formed to appeal to party and government organizations and various groups, requesting sympathy and assistance from all sectors. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Condition of the Hunger-Striking Workers: A portion of the workers, including Liu Yuanxing, Xie Ronggui, Shen Yucheng, Yang Xiutang, Mao Zhaocheng, Fan Yinchuan, Gao Jinshan, Yan Qilang, Gong Yushu, Zhang Zegang, Ding Qiaolang, He Mingzhang, Lu Shiying, Ma Jinchun, Sun Fanren, Zhang Ruitang, Wang Lizhong, Wang Chongzhi, Liu Yushan, Hong Jiaben, Hou Zhangyuan, Zhao Weiyin, and Qu Qifeng, totaling twenty-three individuals, after issuing a hunger strike declaration, have been on hunger strike since yesterday. They are all lying weakly in the dilapidated room of the factory's cool yarn section, in a miserable and pitiful state. Despite attempts by various parties to persuade them to eat, the workers are extremely resolute and refuse to be persuaded. From morning till night yesterday, they did not consume a single grain of rice or a drop of water. If the hunger strike continues, their lives are in grave danger. Furthermore, the hunger-striking worker Hong Jiaben, climbed the factory's water tower in the morning to express his determination, but was later persuaded to come down by security police officers.</p>
<p>▲ The Crying Appeal Group Appeals Separately: After a portion of the factory workers voluntarily went on hunger strike, the other workers who did not participate in the hunger strike organized a crying appeal group. They elected Xu Shimo, Zhang Daqi, Wang Chuncheng, Qin Changgeng, Ge Yuting, etc., as members of the group. Yesterday morning, they went to the Municipal Party Headquarters, Municipal Government, Social Affairs Bureau, Municipal Bureau of Commerce, Citizens' Union, Taxpayer Chinese Association, Lawyers' Association, and other government agencies and public organizations to cry out about the labor-management dispute and the suffering of workers who have lost their livelihoods. Now, some have gone on hunger strike, please provide assistance.</p>
<p>▲ Party and Government Dispatch Personnel to Investigate: After learning about the Sanyou workers' hunger strike and the factory fire, the party and government agencies dispatched Zhou Lianze from the Municipal Party Headquarters and Zhu Guilin from the Social Affairs Bureau to the Sanyou Industrial Corporation's main factory in Yinxiang Port and the Cotton Weaving Industry Union in the Seventh District and the Fourth Precinct in the Fifth District at 2 PM to investigate the truth and persuade the workers to eat. However, the hunger-striking workers remained silent throughout.</p>
<p>▲ Petition to the Municipal Government: Yesterday afternoon at 3 PM, the Sanyou Industrial Corporation's worker crying appeal group sent representatives Zhang Tingliang and Kuang Linchun to the Municipal Government in Fenglin to petition the Municipal Government to resolve the dispute. They were received by Wang Shao, director of the Audit Section. After the representatives described the workers' plight, Director Wang stated to the representatives that the Municipal Government had great sympathy for the Sanyou workers. Without the workers' urging, the Municipal Government was already preparing measures. Although the Social Affairs Bureau's mediation had broken down, it had not yet been reported to the Municipal Government. The Municipal Government would wait for the Social Affairs Bureau to propose resolution conditions and report back, after which the Municipal Government would adopt and decide on them, or submit them to the arbitration committee for arbitration through administrative action. The representatives expressed satisfaction and withdrew.</p>

<p>The Traffic Department of the Two Railways Administration issued a notice yesterday to all transportation companies and station staff, stating that the General Rules for Freight Car Responsible Transportation, which was notified on July 27 and copies of the rules distributed, will be implemented starting September 1. The previous General Rules for Freight Car Responsible Transportation will be abolished at the same time. The stations implementing responsible transportation are tentatively set as Shanghai North Station, Maigen Road, Nanjing, and Jiangbian Station, Shanghai South Station, Rihui Port, Nanxing Bridge, and Zhakou, totaling eight stations. The appendices and detailed methods will be notified by this department for implementation at any time.</p>

<p>The municipal authorities previously believed that although the city's police force was quite sufficient and could adequately maintain public order, dispatching and suppressing emergencies were quite difficult once they occurred. Therefore, to ensure the post-war security and order of Shanghai, a security team was organized, and Huang Ming, director of the Zhabei Office of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, was appointed as the director of the office, and Luo Jingyou, director of the Second Section of the Municipal Government, was appointed as the concurrent deputy director. Since the official announcement of the candidates, all organizational matters of the office have been actively carried out, and the First Regiment has also been reorganized. Recently, the Second Security Regiment has also been reorganized, and at the same time, the organization of the office has been officially approved by the central government and must be reorganized according to regulations. Luo Jingyou, the concurrent deputy director of the office, found that his duties were too heavy and difficult to balance, so yesterday he specially submitted a document to Mayor Wu, requesting permission to resign from the concurrent position of deputy director of the Municipal Security Office.</p>

<p>▲ Participate in the Anti-War League Assembly</p>
<p>The Anti-Civil War League Assembly, initiated by four groups, will be held in Shanghai on the 27th of this month. The following are the recent news of the association's preparations:</p>
<p>▲ National Federation of Commerce and Industry Notifies Executive Committee: The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, originally one of the initiators, specially telegraphed all executive and supervisory committee members yesterday to participate together when the time comes. The original telegram reads: (Title omitted) Recently, we received a letter from the Anti-Civil War League, stating that the association is scheduled to hold a representative assembly on the 27th and 28th of this month at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce meeting hall. Your association is one of the original initiating groups, so we specially request that you send a copy of the names and addresses of all executive and supervisory committee members for the distribution of notices. At the same time, we hope that your association will notify all members to attend when the time comes, etc. Accordingly, in addition to replying to the association to notify directly, we hereby inform your committee for your information, and we hope that you will attend when the time comes to jointly overcome the difficulties of the times. The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce bows respectfully.</p>
<p>▲ The Twelfth Preparatory Meeting This Afternoon: The Anti-Civil War League will hold its twelfth preparatory meeting at noon today to discuss and decide on the agenda of the general assembly and various important issues such as the staff of the general assembly.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Representatives of Dismissed Employees of the E'an Tax Transportation Bureau Come to Shanghai <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>▲ Plead with the Audit General Office to Issue Dismissal Fees</p>
<p>Since the E'an Tax Transportation Bureau was merged into the E'an Audit Office, the employees, fearing unemployment, found life difficult and lacked travel expenses to return to their hometowns. They repeatedly pleaded with the new and old directors, and forwarded their request to the deployment and the Audit General Office, requesting approval to issue two months' dismissal fees. However, a month has passed and the superiors have not yet approved it. The employees are extremely anxious and have specially sent representatives Long Yuhuang and Yi Dade, etc., to Shanghai to personally plead with Zhu, the acting director of the Audit General Office, requesting prompt issuance. The representatives arrived in Shanghai a few days ago. Yesterday morning at 9 AM, they called on Acting Director Zhu. Acting Director Zhu immediately sent a section chief to meet with them. After the representatives stated their intentions, the section chief replied that half a month's dismissal fee would be issued and that the E'an Audit Office had been instructed to do so by telegram. Later, the representatives explained the employees' hardships and the special circumstances of E'an, and pointed out that Xiang'an, despite having no surplus, still issued one month's dismissal fee, while E'an, with a surplus, only issued half a month, which was unfair. They requested that Acting Director Zhu approve the issuance of two months' worth to show compassion. However, the section chief said that the telegram had already been sent and could not be changed easily. If there were reasons, the representatives could submit a request to increase the amount by following the precedent. The representatives then took their leave and prepared to draft an urgent telegram to present to the Audit General Office tomorrow.</p>
<h3 id="e129">The Book Industry Association Runs National Crisis Savings <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>▲ Extract One Thousandth of the Capital</p>
<p>▲ If You Buy Enemy Goods, You Will Be Fined According to the Amount</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce previously resolved at a members' meeting to organize national crisis savings. The detailed methods should be determined by each industry based on its own circumstances. The association received a report from the Book Industry Association stating that it had resolved to organize national crisis savings in four articles at the first executive committee meeting of the second session and reported it to the association. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce believes that the methods formulated by the industry are thorough and commendable and should be approved for filing. It also replied that the handling situation should still be reported at any time for evaluation. The methods are recorded as follows: (1) In the first year, one-thousandth of the capital should be deposited by the member in the bank, and the passbook should be deposited in the association. If savings are still required in the second year, one-thousandth of the capital should be deposited again, and the same procedure should be followed. (2) The paper materials sealed last year will be unsealed by the association, and 5% of the original value will be used as national crisis savings (stored according to the first method) for use. However, products sold directly are still not allowed to be sold. (3) It is not allowed to purchase enemy goods in the future. If there is any violation, please report it to all sectors, and the association will send personnel to seal it up. In addition to confiscation, a fine will be imposed according to the original value (that is, a fine of a certain amount for each yuan of goods seized). Half of the fine will be used for national crisis savings, and half will be given to the person who reports it. (4) Those who do not comply with the above three methods shall be punished by (1) expulsion from membership, (2) no dealings with the same industry, and (3) announcement in the newspaper.</p>
<h3 id="e130">The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Resolves Not to Use Hunchun White Poplar for the Time Being <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>▲ Do Not Indirectly Open Up Profit Sources for the Japanese</p>
<p>▲ Use Yang Wood Unrelated to Japan Instead</p>
<p>Hunchun white poplar is one of the raw materials for matches. Since Liaoji was occupied by the tyrannical Japanese, the area has also been under Japanese influence. The extraction and transportation of timber must be handled by the Japanese and transported by Japanese ships. This matter was raised for discussion at the seventh standing committee meeting of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. After detailed research, it was deemed that sales should be temporarily banned. The following is a record of the correspondence on this case:</p>
<p>▲ Letter from the Match Industry: The National Match Federation sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce stating that it had previously learned from members' reports that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce had convened a discussion among match industry members in Shanghai, instructing them to use goods from other countries rather than domestic goods when purchasing match raw materials and wood for making stems, in order to implement the original intention of boycott. After hearing this, we were deeply impressed. It is now found that one type of wood used to make match stems is Hunchun poplar. There have been many imports recently. The price is about 40% lower per foot than Russian poplar. If it can be used, the cost per box of matches can be reduced by two yuan. However, Hunchun is currently under Japanese influence. The extraction and transportation of this wood must be handled by the Japanese and transported by Japanese merchant ships to reach Shanghai. In this situation, is it related to Japanese goods? If it is considered unrelated, we plan to notify our members to adopt it separately to reduce the cost of matches. This matter concerns the interests of our industry, so we dare to consult specifically and ask for a clear explanation for compliance.</p>
<p>▲ Reply from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce: We received your letter on the 17th of this month, asking whether Hunchun white poplar, which is 40% cheaper per foot than Russian poplar, can be used. We have investigated and your letter also stated that Hunchun is currently under Japanese influence, and the extraction and transportation of this wood must be handled by the Japanese and transported by Japanese merchant ships to reach it. At present, the adoption and extraction of Hunchun white poplar indirectly means creating a source of profit for the Japanese. We can only endure the pain and switch to Yang wood unrelated to Japan. Although the price is higher, in order to implement the purpose of economic severance from Japan, we can only do so. We hope that your association will persuade fellow industries to follow suit.</p>

<p>The Shipping Association replied to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating that it had received a letter dated August 16, stating that the Japanese Yamashita Steamship Company was negotiating with Chinese shipping companies to fly Chinese flags on Japanese ships, and instructed them to immediately investigate and sternly admonish them. The association had not heard of this matter before, and was deeply grateful for the attention. In addition to devising a secret investigation and submitting proposals to the Executive Committee to prevent the action, it has also informed all members to not utilize it and to mutually investigate and report the truth so as to expose and stop it.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Various Industries Vigorously Resist Goods <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>▲ Electrical Machinery Silk Weaving Factory: The Shanghai Electrical Machinery Silk Weaving Factory Industry Association recently issued an urgent notice yesterday because of reports that unscrupulous merchants were selling inferior yarns, changing trademarks, and posing as domestic goods, which could cause confusion and deception for fellow industries when purchasing raw materials. The notice states that since the Wanbaoshan incident last year, the association followed all sectors in striving for economic severance from Japan, and at the same time obeyed the orders of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to establish a Japanese Goods Inspection Group to handle the sealing of Japanese goods in the same industry and to pay attention to weaving raw materials and all kinds of machinery supplies. All goods that were previously reliant on Japanese goods were replaced and eliminated, so that fellow industries expressed determination, promoted domestic goods, and persisted to the end without the slightest slack. To this day, the sealed Japanese goods have never been moved at all. Although this is the natural responsibility of merchants, it is also to save the dying situation in the nick of time. All the above resolutions were recorded and sent to you, and we trust you have reviewed them. Unexpectedly, the first and twenty-eighth of this year were again oppressed by the imperialists. Unfortunately, the suffering of our fellow industries was even more tragic. The war zone of Zhabei Hongkou has always been the area where our silk factories are concentrated. Once it was brutally trampled, it suffered infinite sacrifices. The cruel impression given must have been extremely profound. After the pain of our fellow industries, they must be united in hatred and determined to resist for a long time. Therefore, the association now reiterates its previous proposal and automatically expresses its determination. Regardless of any sacrifices, it will never buy inferior goods again, and will persist to the end, adhering to the original intention of patriotism and encouraging each other to jointly save the dying situation. In this way, on the one hand, we will do our best to adopt domestic goods to promote them, and on the other hand, we can revitalize the industry and promote the various fabrics of our fellow industries as much as possible. All sectors of society are full of patriots and will definitely recognize the domestic goods of this factory and be happy to adopt them. However, recently there have been reports that some unscrupulous merchants are selling inferior yarns, changing trademarks, and posing as domestic goods. If you are not careful, you will be deceived. Therefore, please pay extra attention when buying raw materials. Fortunately, do not be greedy for cheapness. You should first observe the source of the goods to see if it is reliable, and check the personality of the person in charge to see if he is honest, and then you can make the deal. Otherwise, if there are those who are willing to break the rules and collude with unscrupulous merchants regardless of the overall situation, once it is discovered and confirmed, the association will severely punish them and immediately expel them from membership, and the people of the country will jointly abandon them. This matter concerns the survival of the country and the life and death of the nation. Promoting domestic goods is our commercial responsibility. Please pay attention to it and do not regard it as a mere formality.</p>
<p>▲ Hat Shop Industry: The Hat Shop Industry Association recently resolved at an executive committee meeting to send a letter to persuade fellow industries to adhere to their original intentions and reject enemy goods. The letter said that since the September 18th Incident, the Japanese have been using every possible means to invade our country, occupy our land, trample on our sovereignty, massacre our people, and burn and loot our property. Anyone with blood cannot help but feel pain. The administrative authorities in the Northeast only know how to bow their heads and give way, which has made the enemy even more ambitious, and there has been the Battle of Shanghai. The whole country is indignant, and vigorously implementing economic severance is enough to kill them. Therefore, the inspection, sealing, and refusal to buy, sell, and transport goods have sprung up everywhere. Regardless of the effect on the enemy, it goes without saying that it is the minimum expression that our country's citizens should have. However, the blue blood of Shanghai has not yet dried, and the atmosphere of bandits in the Northeast is in full swing, but unscrupulous merchants think that things have passed and are disregarding morality for the sake of profit. Private entry of Japanese goods is heard of every day. According to reports, the recent surge in Japanese goods imports is even more alarming. It is shameless to serve the enemy and shameless. The members of this association deeply sigh and have to say a word to our fellow industries. Our fellow industries have achieved considerable results since the resolution to implement the boycott of enemy goods last year, thanks to the courageous actions of each company. However, at this time when the Northeast Incident is in tension, it is hoped that you will adhere to your original intentions and persist to the end. Regarding the raw materials and other supplies used, please reject enemy goods and do not forget the national humiliation. Do not abandon the success of building a mountain for the sake of immediate profit. You must know that national hatred has not been avenged, and this ambition cannot be slackened. On the active side, we can promote the improvement of production by the people of the country, and on the passive side, we can make the enemy shake their economic organization. All citizens should take this as their responsibility. If there are those who are willing to ignore the rules and act for their own convenience, then the association will fulfill its responsibility to expose them and await the public judgment of the people of the country. Then, not only will they be despised by the same industry, but they will also have nowhere to escape from heaven and earth. I hope that our fellow industries will carefully consider the advantages and disadvantages and know how to deal with themselves.</p>
<p>▲ Chinese and Foreign Grocery Industry: The Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Grocery Industry Association convened its ninth executive committee meeting a few days ago. Six people, including Shi Jingtao, Zhu Jingyu, Cheng Yujie, Peng Binghua, Wang Pingyuan, and Zhang Heshun, attended. Chairman Cheng Yujie conducted the ceremony. In addition to resolving to continue to resist enemy goods, there were many other proposals. In the case of continuing to resist enemy goods, fellow industry members were notified to follow the instructions. The following is an excerpt from the original text of the notice: For the purpose of notification, since the disaster in the Northeast, more than ten months have passed. The local officials who guarded the territory held the principle of non-resistance, which allowed the Japanese bandits to swallow it calmly. There was also the battle of Shanghai on January 28, and the attempt to invade Jehol in the near future to peep into Tianjin. Anyone with blood either went to the frontier to kill the enemy, or conducted a boycott of goods and cut off relations to protect the personality of the Chinese nation and jointly revive the collapsing building. Unexpectedly, recently there have been some people who have lost their minds and are driven by their own private interests to transport Japanese goods without any scruples in the midst of the serious situation in the Northeast. According to reports, there was even a time when as many as 16,000 pieces of goods were delivered, and the value of the bank drafts reached as much as 20 million yuan, which is shocking. After this has reached its extreme, the association has established a Japanese Goods Inspection Group since its inception. Fortunately, all members have been self-respecting and stopped importing enemy goods. However, in order to prevent the same industry from having malpractices, the association hereby notifies the same industry to strictly supervise each other. If there are those who are willing to be the leader of the enemy, regardless of whether they are in the same industry or not, they can report to the association so that we can devise ways to punish them. The boycott of enemy goods must be adhered to to the end, and the promotion of domestic products should be carried out more actively. All of our members should adhere to their original intentions and continue to fulfill their obligations.</p>

<p>▲ Can't Eat Enough, Can't Keep Warm</p>
<p>▲ The Biological Father Flatters His Bed Partner to Win Her Favor</p>
<p>▲ Used a Thick Iron Chain to Lock Him Up in the Loft</p>
<p>▲ Imprisoned for Two Years, Feet as Soft as Cotton</p>
<p>丨Fortunately, a Righteous Person Reported It丨</p>
<p>丨The Police Have Filed a Public Prosecution丨</p>
<p>Dong Renbao, a native of Ningbo, 38 years old, used to be a tailor and newspaper vendor. He and his second wife, Ms. Chen from Xiangshan, Guangdong, rented a room behind the Wanshouchang Coffin Shop at No. 170-172 Meibai Road. Dong's first wife passed away eight years ago, leaving behind a son, Genfu, who is now only 13 years old. Four years ago, Dong began to live with Ms. Chen as his second wife. At that time, she was in her early twenties. After one year of marriage, she gave birth to a daughter, whom she loved dearly. However, she regarded Dong's son from his previous wife as a thorn in her side, not giving him enough to eat or keep warm. Although Min Zilu wore clothes made of reeds, Genfu could not even get that. The ignorant child could not bear the suffering of cold and hunger, so whenever he saw his father,</p>
<p>he would tug at his clothes and cry. Dong Renbao was unusually afraid of his wife. Whenever he heard her roar like a lion, he would obey her every word. He only knew how to win the favor of his bed partner and completely abandoned his own son, allowing her to abuse him. The child often did not get enough to eat, so he secretly took things and exchanged them for money to buy food to satisfy his hunger. The long-tongued woman took the opportunity to slander him, accusing Genfu of stealing and forcing her husband to use cruel methods to strictly discipline him. Dong Renbao then used an extremely</p>
<p>thick iron chain to lock his son in the loft of the coffin shop, giving him only two bowls of coarse rice a day to barely sustain his life. The neighbors on the left and right all knew about this, but because they feared Ms. Chen's ferocity, they all adopted the attitude of sweeping the snow from their own doorsteps and did not dare to speak out or offer a helping hand. As a result, Genfu has been imprisoned for two years. Now, someone has spoken out righteously,</p>
<p>revealing the dark secret. The New Zhabei Police Station in charge of the area dispatched Chinese detectives Ding Huaguo and Zhang Gendi, together with Western detective Aiwen Si, to the coffin shop the day before yesterday to arrest Dong and Ms. Chen. They then went up to the loft and saw Genfu huddled in a dark corner, unable to be pulled up. Shining a light on him, they realized that his left thigh was chained</p>
<p>to a huge piece of wood and locked. The detectives asked Dong for the key. Dong took it from his pocket and gave it to them. Only then were they able to open the lock. However, the child remained curled up. When asked why he could not stand up, he said that both his feet were as soft as cotton, and tears streamed down his face as he spoke. The detectives carried him downstairs. Under the bright sunlight, he looked even more pale and emaciated. His black shirt and pants were filthy, and his feet were bare.</p>
<p>Those who saw him were all saddened and said that his parents were extremely cruel. Later, the Chinese and Western detectives took him to the police station. In addition to detaining Dong and Ms. Chen separately, they sent Genfu to Renji Hospital. The doctor examined him and found that the muscles in the child's feet and legs had lost their ability to move. Whether he would be able to walk again would not be determined until three months later. Yesterday morning, the police sent Dong and his wife to the First Special District District Court, and Genfu was still carried to the court by the detectives and sat on the floor. Later, Judge Wu Tingqi questioned him. First, the police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated</p>
<p>that the police accused the defendants of (1) violating Article 294 of the Criminal Law for causing injury, (2) violating Article 310 of the Criminal Law for abandonment, and (3) violating Article 316 of the Criminal Law for obstructing freedom. He then described the situation of solving the case. Next, Western detective Aiwen Si reported the investigation and the situation of arresting the defendants. Judge Wu immediately questioned Genfu. According to his confession, his biological mother had died, Ms. Chen was his stepmother, he had been</p>
<p>locked up for two years, and he was given two bowls of rice a day. He looked very depressed and had none of the liveliness of a child. From the judge down, everyone felt compassion for him. Then, Dong Renbao and Ms. Chen were questioned. Both admitted to locking up their son, but claimed that it was because he had been stealing things and had not repented despite repeated warnings, so they had done this, and that they had only locked him up in February of last year. Judge Wu verified the confession and angrily said to Dong and Ms. Chen, "Do you have children? Would you also shackle your own children?" He then ordered the police to carry the child to the forensic room. After the forensic doctor examined him, he was ordered to be sent to the Women and Children Relief Association for temporary stay. The defendants were remanded in custody and the hearing was rescheduled for August 23.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Reporter's Letter of Reprimand to Chen Xinghan <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>▲ Regarding the case of insulting members of the association</p>
<p>The Shanghai Press Association yesterday sent a letter to Chen Xinghan, director of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railway bureaus, which stated: "Dear Sir, we have received reports from members Xu Shen and Wu Dong stating that on the 6th of this month, President Wang arrived in Shanghai from Beijing by special train. As reporters, concerned with our professional responsibilities, we rushed to the Maigen Road and Zhenru locations to conduct interviews. However, you, sir, interfered unreasonably, shouted loudly, and even ordered the railway police to use force to drive us away, and did not allow us to park our cars on the public road next to the station. This situation is not only a blatant insult, but also an instance of you, as the director of the railway bureau, interfering with municipal traffic. You, sir, are suspected of exceeding your authority. An effort to support the news industry has been solemnly passed by the National Assembly, and reporters going to train stations for interviews has been practiced for many years. You, sir, have served in the two railway bureaus for many years, how could you not know this principle? Even if you were ordered to protect someone, what is your position, sir, and who are the reporters, that you would allow yourself to shout loudly and drive them away arbitrarily? Our association believes that your actions insult the personality of all reporters. After a resolution by the entire Executive Committee, we are sending this letter for your review, and request a clear written response, and ask for a guarantee that the above situation will not happen again. We sincerely value our public friendship."</p>
<h3 id="e136">A New Wireless Radio Broadcasting Station Established in the French Concession <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>▲ Broadcasting Begins Today</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that a new wireless radio broadcasting station has been established in the French Concession, named F.F.Z. It will begin broadcasting tomorrow (the 19th). Its broadcasting studio is located at 149 Avenue Joffre, with a wavelength of 224 meters and a power of 250 watts. The radio waves can reach 1,840 kilometers. The station's origin came about because after the Shanghai war broke out in February this spring, many French soldiers in Shanghai did not understand the English broadcasting programs and felt quite lonely. Therefore, a small French-language broadcasting station was established. Later, the results were quite satisfactory. Famous overseas Chinese businessmen in the French Concession then took over the station. Anyone wishing to contact the station can call 80567 to reach the broadcasting studio.</p>

<h3 id="e140">July Construction Report from the Municipal Public Works Bureau <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>▲ Zhabei's Proportion Has Returned to Its Original Position</p>
<p>According to the Public Works Bureau's report on the general construction situation in the city for July, 244 construction permits were issued for the entire month, excluding rural housing, covering a total area of approximately 43,000 square meters, with an estimated value of over 1.38 million yuan. Compared to the previous month, the area increased by over 7,000 square meters and the estimated value increased by over 410,000 yuan. Comparing the districts, Zhabei has recovered its original position, with both area and estimated value ranking first. In addition, 237 repair permits, 126 miscellaneous permits, and 15 demolition permits were issued, covering an area of over 7,000 square meters. Comparing the districts, South Shanghai had the most, followed by Zhabei. There were 220 corrective actions, one-sixth more than the previous month, mostly due to non-compliant construction. Zhabei district accounted for more than half.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Public Concession Health Conditions in July <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>The report of the Health Officer of the Municipal Council for the month of July states: The death rate for foreigners this month was 17.87 per thousand, and the death rate for Chinese was 12.72. However, the number of Chinese may not be entirely accurate. Pneumonia was the most common cause of death among foreigners, while tuberculosis was the most common cause of death among Chinese, followed by cholera.</p>
<p>Cholera had reached its peak near the end of July. The infection rate among foreigners was 0.61 per thousand, and among Chinese was 0.99 per thousand. However, many of these cases could not be definitively identified as cholera. The arrival of melons on the market coincided with the peak of the epidemic. However, according to recent research by the Health Department and the United States, melons are not suitable for transmitting cholera bacteria. Their relationship with cholera is probably due to their chemical composition and the effect on digestion. In summary, the Health Department advises people to immerse fruits in boiling water before eating them. Residents should adopt this method, which is simple and easy to implement. Even if the water source is clean, it should be boiled before drinking. Filtration alone is not sufficient.</p>
<p>There were many cases of heatstroke in mid-July. The reason is probably that the early summer was quite cool, and then suddenly became very hot, leading to negligence. The best approach is to wear cool and suitable clothing, avoid exertion during the day, and not overeat or exercise. In this way, heatstroke can be avoided.</p>
<p>The pathological research laboratory examined 3,013 samples, of which 1,731 were for cholera examination. The number of examinations in the last two months was the highest on record. Among the examined items, there were 51 milk samples, 125 mosquito larvae samples, and several well water samples. No cholera bacteria were found in the well water, but several were quite polluted. In addition, the Pest Treatment Room treated 75 people this month.</p>
<p>The isolation hospital established by the Municipal Council admitted 80 cholera patients this month, 57 of whom were Chinese. The reason for the relatively small number of admissions compared to other hospitals is probably due to stricter procedures. Many of the staff in the epidemic prevention injection team were sick this month, which hindered the work considerably. However, more than 49,000 people were still injected, and the total number of people injected has reached 136,397. Patients in the tuberculosis hospital made little progress due to the hot weather.</p>
<p>Milk production decreased by 14% this month. Four cases of milk adulteration with water were discovered. The licenses of one grade A dairy farm were temporarily suspended, and one grade B dairy farm will be revoked. Four cases of private milk sales were prosecuted. Due to the heat, the number of slaughtered livestock decreased this month. Approximately 800 cattle were inspected. The Xinzha small vegetable market opened this month. The night inspection and sampling by the vegetable market team was very busy.</p>
<p>The cleaning team was busier due to the investigation of cholera, disinfection, well water medication, and management of vendors. The Municipal Council's outdoor swimming pool opened in July. The new water filter is better than the old one.</p>

<p>▲ Municipal Government Replies to the Housing Association</p>
<p>Regarding the tragic murder case of the Lizhong Lane tenant by an Indian gatekeeper, the housing association of the lane submitted a request to the municipal government and the municipal party headquarters for serious handling. The municipal party headquarters has already approved it. Now, a reply No. 247 from the municipal government states: "Received the submission. This case has been formally filed with the British Consulate by the Municipal Public Security Bureau, with the help of Qu Sunyi, the bureau's third section assistant, accompanied by Wang Yan, the police officer handling the case, and witnesses, requesting punishment of the murderer, compensation, and guarantees to prevent similar incidents from happening again in the future. Please be informed." This is the reply.</p>
<h3 id="e144">A Counterfeit Coin Manufacturing Organization Uncovered on North Shaanxi Road <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Detective Chen Daquan and Zheng Huaili of the Huishi Patrol discovered that someone had secretly set up a counterfeit coin manufacturing organization at No. 261 North Shaanxi Road to disrupt the financial system. They coordinated with Western detective Oumen and secretly went to the address at about 9 o'clock the night before last night, arrested Xiang Rongfa, a native of Shaoxing, and seized 90 counterfeit dollars, 1,129 counterfeit double dimes, 8 genuine foreign dollars, dozens of chemical bottles of various sizes, as well as account books, printing and sales waste water, wooden boxes, etc. All were taken to the patrol, and Xiang confessed that all the counterfeit coins were received from Dingyu Money Shop at No. 294 Jiujiang Road. The Chinese and Western detectives then went to Dingyu to search and seized 1,700 counterfeit double dimes and 52 counterfeit dollars on the spot. The shop clerk Geng Taikun, a native of Zhenjiang, was arrested and taken back to the patrol for detention. Yesterday morning, Xiang and Geng, along with the counterfeit coins, were sent to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special District Local Court. Wang Yaotang, the patrol's lawyer, immediately rose to detail the circumstances of the case, saying that after investigation by the patrol, it was found that the defendants manufactured counterfeit coins by first removing the silver surface of genuine silver dollars and mixing the middle with copper coins. The case still has accomplices who have not been apprehended, and the investigation procedures have not yet been completed. Therefore, the two defendants will not be prosecuted temporarily and request permission to detain them. He then presented the counterfeit coins to the court. Judge Wu Tingqi briefly questioned Xiang and Geng, and Xiang hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend him. Judge Wu ordered that the case be detained for seven days for further review.</p>
<h3 id="e145">The Sun Jingchen Inheritance Lawsuit Court Order Mediation <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Sun Jingfu, a former comprador of the Peaceful Foreign Firm, whose alias was Jingchen, passed away last year, leaving behind a huge inheritance of several million yuan. The eldest daughter, Ji Zhang, who married into the Tao family in Ningbo, hired lawyer Wu Zhiping based on the legal provisions for married women to inherit property and filed a lawsuit in the civil court of the First Special District Court requesting an equal share of the inheritance. The case has been dragging on for months, with repeated postponements of the trial. As reported in previous issues, at 11:00 AM yesterday (August 18th), Judge Shen Hong resumed the inquiry in the tenth courtroom. The defendant hired lawyer Zhang Shizhao as his agent. The defendant himself did not attend. Zhang Shizhao stated first that the case was a family dispute and that the law should be combined with compassion. The plaintiff and defendant were both family members, and there was no matter that could not be discussed. He requested that the court order mediation outside the court or transfer the case directly to the mediation office for processing in accordance with the law. He then presented a written opinion, which was very detailed and comprehensive. Judge Shen immediately followed lawyer Zhang's statement and asked lawyer Wu, the agent of the plaintiff, what he thought. Lawyer Wu consulted with Tao Sun on the spot and replied that he was willing to accept, but requested that the issue of whether the property was indeed owned by Sun Jingchen or had been granted to his son Bin Xuan be resolved first before proceeding with the mediation. The judge then instructed that since it was a matter of feelings, there was no need to be bound by the law. Both parties should do their best to mediate outside the court. If mediation failed, the court would set a date for a trial in accordance with the law. His words were very sincere. The two parties then left the court in accordance with the instructions. This heated family lawsuit may have come to an end. The original manuscript of lawyer Zhang's opinion is found and is urgently published as follows:</p>
<p>Sun Zhu Lingxian being sued by Tao Sun Jizhang for division of property, agent lawyer Zhang Shizhao's additional opinion statement, law is inseparable from emotion, emotion can help law, I implore you to take both into account and instruct mediation matters, I, the lawyer, acting for Sun Zhu Lingxian being sued by Tao Sun Jizhang for division of inheritance, one side says that all the property was created by the father and should be distributed equally according to law, the other side says that the property was left by the late husband and should be inherited by the only son. As the saying goes, a common man is innocent, but he is guilty of possessing treasures. This is also true of the so-called inheritance in this case. This is a family matter, I can't help but sigh. Although the Sun family is a business family, they respect etiquette and teaching. When the old man was alive, he was dignified and elegant, and the whole family was harmonious. The family affairs were all arranged according to traditional customs and old habits, and there was no discord between parents, siblings, etc. All arrangements were made in advance. Sun Jingchen, around the age of 45 or 46, fearing that he might not recover from his illness, had disposed of all his property, mostly granting the business that should be inherited to his son Xu Xuan, and giving each of his two daughters a gift when they were married, and separately allocating a fixed amount of 6,500 yuan to benefit them. The eldest daughter, Xu Zhang, who was favored by her father, had a very generous dowry. Her husband's business was booming, and it was due to the assistance of her father-in-law. The 6,500 yuan that was allocated to Xu Zhang was used to generate more money and increase her wealth. The Tao family is now among the wealthy families in Siming. Who bestowed this wealth? Friends and relatives can all testify to this. The second daughter, Yi Zhang, has not yet been married. The sisters-in-law depend on each other and share their resources. The funds for her future dowry will be as generous as her sister's. The 6,500 yuan has also been separately reserved and can be withdrawn at any time. Even based on this, the old man has been planning for his two daughters, and it is definitely not that they have nothing. As for Bin Xuan, he unfortunately passed away five years ago, leaving behind three sons and one daughter. The eldest son is now only 18 years old, and the youngest is not yet 8 years old. The widow, Zhu, who is the defendant in this case, is raising her young children and carefully guarding her home. Considering the total amount of the inheritance, it is not easy to determine whether there is enough to cover the living expenses and future education and marriage expenses of the children. Furthermore, reducing it will lead to insufficient resources, while the income will be greatly reduced. The orphans and widows, who are inherently unfamiliar with making a living, have unexpectedly seen the Sun family go from being well-off to being in dire straits. The situation of Ji Zhang is the opposite. Her family is already wealthy, and her situation is even better. The master has become famous and established a business, and it is thriving. It is not necessary to count the wife's wealth. It is unreasonable to ask her to analyze every penny with the descendants of her deceased brother. It is no different from taking food from the hungry to add to the wealth of the rich. How can the deceased father and brother bear this? Yi Zhang, who lives in the inner chambers, is still a person who shares the same property and feels the same pain. She is even more concerned. She has no intention of seizing her brother's share, burdening her widowed sister-in-law, and monopolizing huge wealth to show off. This is the natural sympathy of human beings. It has been argued that the current law for married women to inherit property has only been established for a few years. Compared with the deeply rooted customary law, it is not difficult to ponder the kind of changes that are reflected in social psychology. The Sun family is a traditional family, and it is difficult to blame them for not understanding the new legal meaning. Sun Jingchen's arrangements for his children during his lifetime were made with a clear conscience. According to the law, the will can be freely disposed of in part. Now that the soil is not yet dry, the testator's intentions are completely erased. Is it reasonable to consider it in terms of human feelings? The spirit of reform is to make laws, and the wonderful use of law is to harmonize. If this provision is implemented without considering the actual social situation at that time and without balancing and weighing it, there will be the sigh of having a law that is useless and the danger of breaking the bounds. On the contrary, the original intention of legislation may also be violated. In this transitional era, a flexible approach that combines human feelings and the law is inevitable. According to Article 2 of the Civil Mediation Law, "Civil litigation cases may not be filed unless mediation has failed in the Civil Mediation Office. The parties may also request mediation for other civil litigation cases." The original intention of the national legal system is that all disputes between relatives should be settled with leniency and feelings rather than law, or even by bending the law to accommodate feelings. Law is the body, and emotion is the use. When emotion and law are combined, the Dao is greatly connected. This is the case in all countries with the rule of law in the world, and it is even more deeply rooted and indelible among the Chinese people who respect etiquette and righteousness. This case is originally a lawsuit for the division of property, but tracing back to the origin, it is still a dispute over kinship and human affairs. Although its legal nature does not involve compulsory mediation, the way of the king is based on human feelings, and feelings lead to law, and law is established according to feelings. It is appropriate to say that it should be included in the list of cases that can be requested for mediation. When this case was not yet in litigation, public relatives gathered and discussed many times. The plaintiff even proposed a plan, saying that the Sun family's property should be divided into four shares, with Bin Xuan's wife and children sharing two shares, and Ji Zhang and Yi Zhang each getting one share. It is not that the burdens of the deceased brother's family are heavier than the two sisters. Because of this extrajudicial proposal, the friendship is deeply appreciated. The evidence is there, and it is not difficult to inquire. Moreover, the younger sister's intention to preserve the orphans is even more advanced. According to her proposal, the father's entire property should be divided into eight shares: one for ancestor worship, one for Ji Zhang, one for Yi Zhang, one for Ling Xian (the defendant), one each for Wen Kui, Hong Yu, Wen Lan, and Wen Da. At that time, the written terms of the agreement were signed to show solemnity (the video is attached) and shown to relatives and friends, and all praised it. Apart from this, there were many more discussions on resolving the dispute, either through the testimony of the middleman or through the presence of a lawyer. This shows that the two parties in this case are not stubborn and unreasonable people. As members of the same family, there is no matter that cannot be discussed. Although the distance is far, it can be cut and honed. Reading the plaintiff's complaint, the upper part is based on various articles of the Civil Code, and the lower part requires "the right to jointly divide the inheritance with Bin Xuan's wife and children and Yi Zhang." Is the phrase "Bin Xuan's wife and children" a collective noun or a distributive noun? If it is a collective noun, it is consistent with the above-mentioned legal text. If it is a distributive noun, it is in line with the eight-part agreement with Yi Zhang. The language involves two ambiguities, and the benevolent and the wise see differently. This is probably the intention of the lawyer who drafted the complaint, which is particularly vague and uncertain, and implicitly opens up a path for long-term discussion. Furthermore, although the method of news reporting is in legal terms, it is not enough to be a model. As for inferring people's hearts and desires, it should be in the middle and not far from the truth. On the morning after the last court hearing, a news report in this city contained an account of the case, which included "requesting that Sun Zhu's children be allowed to divide equally" (the original newspaper is attached). The reporter did not understand the legal provisions and directly recorded the events. The fact that the reporter wrote so much about Sun Zhu's children and the fact that the original complaint cited the legal text of the first order are not very consistent but are not aware of it, probably meaning that the analysis must be done in this way to achieve fairness, otherwise, the number of inversions will be reversed, and a widow and four orphans will have concerns about insufficient resources. Our country's trial system does not adopt a jury. This kind of simple and honest public opinion cannot be incorporated into the judge's decision. The lawyer does not avoid elaborating, and the above-mentioned popular views on civil litigation such as this case are sufficient evidence to overturn and break. Try to ask a passerby, do you agree to burden the heavy and take more to survive, and not hurt the unburdened and take less? Or do you agree to the unburdened take more to be at ease, because it is very harmful to the burdened and take less? What is the answer? Even a child can easily predict. Based on this, where is the crux of this case? It is clear at a glance. Based on the above, only in accordance with the provisions of Article 370 of the Civil Procedure Law and Article 2 of the Civil Mediation Law, I request the court to instruct the two parties to mediate, or directly transfer it to the mediation office to proceed in accordance with the law. As for whether the mediation is conducted during the trial, or whether the plaintiff and defendant are instructed to elect a fair relative or friend to gather and discuss outside the court, it is all up to the presiding judge to weigh and decide. The lawyer is not in a position to make a request. If this is the case, the law will not feel that there is a narrow and difficult law to uphold, and the people will not see that there are feelings that are retained and not expressed. It is both fair and virtuous, and it can be said to be convenient for both. Sincerely, Shanghai First Special District Local Court.</p>
<h3 id="e146">The Press Visited the Kang Yuan Manufacturing Factory <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>At noon yesterday, Xiang Kangyuan, general manager of the Kang Yuan Canning Factory, invited the press to visit the factory. More than 20 people, including Zhang Zhuping, Wu Tingchen, Zhang Shutong, Chen Zehua, Jiang Hongjiao, Shen Danqing, Gong Zhongxian, Ling Qihan, Ma Yinliang, and Fan Jingwu, attended. Xiang Kangyuan led a tour of the entire factory and then took a seat for lunch. Xiang Kangyuan delivered a welcome speech and reported on the current situation of the factory. Next, Wang Zhixin, president of the New China Bank, reported on the reorganization and expansion plan, saying, "It is found that there are eight canning industries in this city. The Kang Yuan factory is the most impressive in terms of scale and equipment. In terms of business scope, the Kang Yuan factory is about 800,000 yuan per year, which is comparable to the total business volume of the other seven factories. Most of the large companies in the country that need canning are customers of the factory, including foreign companies such as Meifu, Asia, and Deshigu, and merchants in the Nanyang Islands also order from it because its pricing is lower than that of foreign manufacturers. It is also found that the demand for cans increases with the needs of social life. For example, the number of cigarette cans required is hundreds of thousands per day. The demand for other canned products such as gasoline, tea, milk, biscuits, and various candies and meat and vegetable foods is also increasing day by day. Therefore, there is no need to adopt competitive means from the same industry to enrich themselves by expanding and reorganizing. If the original plan is followed to use the original machinery and equipment or sporadic waste materials to manufacture accessories, then the business scope will definitely be more impressive. After being entrusted by the Kang Yuan factory to design the reorganization, this bank spent several months and obtained the assistance of many experts to conduct a detailed investigation and review of the content of the factory. The results are considered perfect and are willing to contribute the research results to the society so that the world can understand the actual situation of the Kang Yuan factory to prove that it is a good investment. It is hoped that this promising business will be assisted by strength and win glory for our country's industry. However, this move by this bank is still in its infancy in the country. We sincerely hope that all sectors of society will give guidance. If the promotion of this bank receives a response from the society, then what is beneficial will not only be the Kang Yuan factory alone." Finally, Zhang Zhuping gave a speech, saying, "The rise and fall of a factory depends on whether the management is effective. The Kang Yuan factory is known for its application of scientific management and has the reputation of a model factory. Observing the factory's strict work, the workers' diligence, and the meticulous organization, it is indeed rare. There are dormitories, schools, hospitals, sports fields, and other facilities related to employee benefits in the factory. It can be seen that the factory pays attention to the health and education of employees and other fundamental issues. In recent years, there have been many labor unrests, but this factory has not been affected, which is no coincidence. It is found that the larger the factory, the more difficult the management. Now the Kang Yuan factory has been in operation for ten years and has a good foundation. Gradual expansion will definitely be easier to succeed than a new creation. Now the organization is changed from a sole proprietorship to a company, gathering talents and assigning special responsibilities to cope with the expansion of the business, which can make the management more stringent. It is deeply hoped that the future development of this industry, which is related to the national economy and people's livelihood, will be immeasurable."</p>

<p>Shen Shaolin, nicknamed "Old Cowhide," a Pootung native residing at No. 44, Machiaobang Road, Lujiabang, went out to greet the gods during the Gaochang Temple deity parade a few days ago. His 22-year-old daughter-in-law, Shen Yan, remained at home to guard the house. When Shen returned home from the parade, he found his daughter-in-law had hanged herself in her room. The reason for her suicide is unknown. He immediately reported it to the Second Precinct, Second Substation, which ordered the local official, Tao Rong, to report it to the local court for examination. The deceased's brother, Yan Yalong, filed a case, requesting exemption from the examination.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Fire at Wangjia Wharf <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>▲ Fire Broke Out in Wang Xiaoshan's Shop</p>
<p>▲ Spread to Four Neighboring Houses</p>
<p>Wang Xiaoshan, a 49-year-old Hubei native, had been running a bamboo wares workshop at the entrance of Jichang Lane, Xiangma Road, Wangjia Wharf, Nanshi. Recently, due to the end of summer, business had been slow, and his family resided in the overpass building in the same lane. He had fire insurance on his workshop for over 1,500 taels of silver. Yesterday around 11:00 AM, a fire suddenly broke out, the cause unknown, in the overpass building where Wang resided. The flames quickly spread, breaking through the roof. The Firefighters' Union immediately rang the alarm. Fire brigades from various districts rushed to the scene with pump trucks, connecting hoses and spraying water. However, due to the extraordinary ferocity of the fire, the rescue efforts were quite challenging. In an instant, the fire spread to neighboring properties: No. 613, Xia Futai's used goods store; No. 611, Zheng Gongyi's palm fiber clothing store; No. 609, Yao Fuxing's leather shoe store; and No. 1621, Yuan Cheng's roasted goods store. Fortunately, the firefighters exerted their utmost effort in extinguishing the fire. After about an hour, the fire was finally put out. Besides the one overpass room of Wang Xiaoshan, four rooms of Xia Futai's used goods store, two levels of Yuan Cheng's roasted goods store, one building of Yao Fuxing's leather shoe store, and one building of Zheng Gongyi's palm fiber clothing store, a total of more than ten rooms, were all destroyed. However, Xia Futai had fire insurance for 5,000 taels of silver, and the bundled old cloth was not easily flammable, so it was not completely destroyed. Yuan Cheng's roasted goods store also had fire insurance for over 3,500 taels of silver, so the loss was relatively small. The two shops owned by Zheng Gongyi and Yao Fuxing did not have insurance, so their losses are immeasurable. When the fire was raging, the police officer from the area arrived and took Wang into the First Precinct, First Substation. After a preliminary examination by the substation chief, because Wang had a large amount of fire insurance and the cause of the fire was unknown, raising many suspicions, he was ordered to prepare a document to be submitted to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for a thorough investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Unidentified Ore <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Around 8 PM the night before, a rickshaw carrying more than twenty pieces of ore was spotted in the Xuejiabang area of Nanshi. The rickshaw puller's behavior was flustered and suspicious. Zhou Qinghui, the guard on duty at the 18th station, noticed it and brought the person and evidence to the First Precinct, First Substation. During the preliminary examination by the substation chief, the puller identified himself as Peng Heyun, 19 years old, from Tongzhou, residing at No. 132, Sangyuan Street, outside Xiaonanmen. He claimed that someone had brought the ore by boat from Pudong and, after landing at Fengji Wharf, hired him to transport it to Xuejiabang. When he was apprehended by the police, the man had already fled in the meantime. Because its origin was unknown, he was ordered to prepare a document to be sent to the bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>Railway transportation is the central point of all railway undertakings, possessing a public nature and certain obligations.

<p>Wanyan Injury Medicine is a secret recipe passed down through generations from Master Shangkong of the Shaolin Temple in Henan, directly inherited by the famous late Ming boxer Xu Tianlong. It has been used for over 300 years and has cured more than tens of thousands of people. Famous Qing Dynasty doctors such as Wei Junping and Wang Zhaodan tried various methods to purchase the recipe at a high price. However, their descendants adhered to ancestral teachings and would not pass it on to outsiders even if it meant losing their fortune. Therefore, the world values it. This medicine specializes in treating falls and injuries, both new and old internal injuries. At most, five doses will cure it. For those with broken skin, regardless of the size of the wound, unconsciousness, or festering wound, wind entering the body, eyes crooked, hands and feet twitching, shaped like a bow, as long as there is a slight warmth in front of the heart, apply this medicine to the wound. If there is a lot of pus, wash it with warm tea to avoid the wind and then apply it. If there is no pus, no need to wash it. Also, take a packet with hot aged wine, or if not drinking, with boiling water. It can bring you back to life, but vomiting is difficult to treat. Or, for cutting the neck and throat, or knife wounds causing intestines to flow out, simply seal the mouth with fresh chicken skin and quickly take the medicine to heal. Now, Xu's residence at No. 42, Hengchang Lane, Beile Road, French Concession, is openly helping the world. It was originally intended to be given away for free, but it was expected that the demand would be overwhelming. On the 13th alone, a total of 837 packets were given away. There were also numerous requests for distribution. Therefore, it was temporarily decided to charge 20 cents per packet and give away a thick volume of Buddhist scriptures to limit the demand. All pharmacies and major tobacco and paper shops are selling it on consignment.</p>

<h3 id="e164">The "Fragrant and Foul" Lawsuit <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>The two lawsuits that have caused a sensation in society are those of Yun Huifang and Hu Lifu... Yun Huifang is a patriotic youth, and Hu Lifu is a traitor from Zhabei. The difference in their characters, one fragrant and one foul, can be measured in distance.</p>
<p>In terms of property, Hu Lifu is a member of the propertied class, while Yun Huifang is a poor young man... In terms of age, Hu Lifu has passed the age of fifty when one knows the decrees of heaven, while Yun Huifang is still a youth with unsettled blood... In terms of experience, Hu Lifu has considerable achievements in military and commercial circles, while Yun Huifang is a novice who cannot yet be said to have started a career. In terms of names, the two characters "Lifu" are so self-confident, with the great meaning of a weak man having ambition. The two characters "Huifang" seem like a woman, which is very different from the meaning of "Lifu". In every respect, Hu Lifu is superior to Yun Huifang. The only difference is that one is a traitor, and the other is patriotic. Therefore, mentioning Yun Huifang is like entering a room of orchids, while mentioning Hu Lifu is like entering a stall of abalone.</p>
<p>Compatriots, you can wake up! Traitorous life is certainly not a business strategy... Having a lot of property is useless, being old is useless, having experience is useless, having a good name is useless. The facts tell me that the power of social sanction is very great. Everyone wants to lift Yun Huifang to the thirty-third heaven, and everyone wants to lower Hu Lifu to the eighteenth level of hell.</p>
<p>Social sanction is based solely on personality, not on status. Moreover, Hu Lifu is only a member of the propertied class, and it is useless even if he becomes a noble official. But look, the illustrious and powerful Grand Tutor Qin Hui is infamous for ten thousand years, while the insignificant Palace Small School Shi Quan is famous for eternity! Compatriots, you can wake up!</p>
<h3 id="e165">The General with Different-Sized Eyes <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— Bi Cheng</p>
<p>Those in history who are known for their appearance are not necessarily all true. Mostly, it is to exaggerate the words of sages and heroes, saying that they are different from ordinary people. For example, Yao's eyebrows have eight colors, Shun's eyes have double pupils, and Yu's ears have three holes. All these are exaggerations. Later historians did not examine them and followed their shortcomings. For example, Xiang Yu also had double pupils, and Emperor Gao of Han had a prominent nose. Novelists, of course, added fuel to the fire. Some used historical books, and some created their own strange theories, such as hands hanging past the knees, eyes that can look back at the ears, phoenix eyes, silkworm eyebrows, leopard eyes, tiger beards, green eyes, purple beards, etc., almost countless. I don't know that this is all wrong. Sages and heroes are in their integrity and learning, not in their appearance. Having such strange appearances is to make them different. Ordinary people think that their appearance is ordinary, and they will not be able to strengthen their ambition and study, thinking that my appearance is only equal to ordinary people, how can I hope for virtuous and heroic careers? Those who gray the hearts of the people are the mistakes of ancient history. Mencius's book is righteous and strict. Chu Zi said, "The king sent him to see you, sir. Is there anything different from others?" Mencius said, "Why is it different from others? Yao and Shun are the same as others." It can be seen that eyebrows with eight colors and eyes with double pupils are not necessarily all true. Yue E Wang is called the General with Different-Sized Eyes. This is a real thing. One eye is big, and one eye is small. In ordinary terms, it is almost like uneven facial features. Common villagers often have this. Therefore, it is known that it is not an exaggeration of a virtuous hero to have this saying. The other day, I took my children to Hangzhou to visit the Ming Sheng Lake and Yue Temple. Seeing the statue of King E, I pointed it out and said, "Don't you see that the right eye is slightly smaller and the left eye is slightly larger?" They replied, "Yes." "Is it because the sculptor is not a master and has this shortcoming?" I said, "No. This must be because the gentry at that time were careful and instructed the sculptor to do it." It is said that after the Wind Wave Pavilion and the disaster, this bad news had not yet been spread to the palace, or Gaozong deliberately kept it secret. After a long time, Gaozong's mother and queen suddenly asked Gaozong, "Why haven't I seen the General with Different-Sized Eyes for a long time?" Gaozong was vague in his words to answer. Now the statue of King E is indeed with different-sized eyes. From this, it is known that the gentry at that time were careful and must have instructed the sculptor without any doubt. Also, according to the historical records, those with defects in appearance are almost all true records. For example, Wei Yongzhi had a hare lip. The doctor said it could be repaired. Fang Gan also had a hare lip. Yan</p>
<h3 id="e166">Stumbled <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Ping</p>
<p>One day, I was wandering at a crossroads and accidentally stumbled after being hit by a vehicle. The people around me laughed.</p>
<p>May I ask: Who is happy to take care of this trivial matter? Naturally, the car ran away in a puff of smoke. Then a burst of frivolous laughter, the wandering threads of the frightened soul were grabbed from the coma. Yo! Knees, arms, covered in blood - dripping blood, damn it this pain is really unbearable, but the pain is yours to bear, who will comfort you? Even who will help you?</p>
<p>Remember this lesson. After a person falls, they have to rely on their own strength to get up. Relying on others is the most useless and will be disappointing. And, you must also recognize this point, this drama is painful, not joyful.</p>
<p>Shibo lacked teeth. Those who ridiculed him called him a proverb. The Northern History records that Yang Dayan's prestige spread far and wide. Between Jing, Si, Huai, and Mian, children who were crying were afraid of him, saying that Yang Dayan had arrived, and they would stop immediately. The History of the Five Dynasties records that Li Keyong had one eye squinted and was called the One-Eyed Dragon. The Spring and Autumn Gu Liang Biography says that Ji Sunxing's father was bald, Jin Queke was squint-eyed, Wei Sun Liangfu was lame, and Cao Gongzi was hunched. At the same time, they were engaged to Qi. Qi made the bald person drive the bald person, the squint-eyed person drive the squint-eyed person, the lame person drive the lame person, and the hunched person drive the hunched person. This is also a defect in appearance, ridiculed by neighboring countries. It is definitely a fact. It is different from the strange appearances of exaggerating virtuous heroes. Hangzhou West Lake has many tourists. For the statue of King Yue being with different-sized eyes, I am afraid that not everyone can distinguish it. Or they don't even know the story of King Yue being called the General with Different-Sized Eyes. Therefore, I record it randomly to tell later generations.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Random Talk in the Capital <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Jia</p>
<p>Since the signing of the Shanghai Incident Agreement, the population of the capital has increased sharply again. In the Qinhuai River, where singing and dancing are prevalent, every time the sun sets, waves of bees and butterflies, those who collect wine and seek food, come and go in a bustling manner, and the road is blocked. In the tea houses where singing is clear, during this humid heat, they are full every night. The small food stalls nearby offer both cold and hot food. Unfortunately, the equipment is simple and cannot attract people. The more elegant arrangements are the Living Ice Room on Taiping Road and the Everyday Coffee Shop on Xinjiekou. There are countless others that arise from time to time.</p>
<p>The rolling watermelon with a single eye is a wonderful product for cooling off. Because of this year's high heat and sultry heat, people are competing to buy it. As a result, sales are booming. It is said that 3,000 loads can be sold a day. However, with a population of 600,000 in the capital, each watermelon averaging five pounds, only one watermelon can be obtained for every ten people. I am afraid that the hard-working compatriots who work hard all day will still not be able to enjoy it universally. Is something as low as a melon also thick for them and thin for us?</p>
<p>The Central Swimming Pool is next to the National Sports Field in Linggu Temple, which is far from the city. The equipment is magnificent and incomparably luxurious. Commentators say that it is becoming aristocratic because the round-trip fare and the cost of buying a ticket to enter the pool are beyond the economic reach of the average citizen. A few days before the opening, Wang Jingwei and his wife once went to the pond with Tieci and Zeng Zhongming early in the morning and entered the water together to enjoy their water life. It is said that Wang has quite a bit of interest in swimming.</p>
<p>The four major trunk roads of the capital are gradually being completed. Zhonghua Road reaches Yuhuatai in the south and is an important transportation route and one of the four major trunk roads. Since Mayor Shi took office, he has started demolition and bidding, with a deadline for completion. The contractors think that the daytime is too hot, and it is better to work at night. Most of the gas lamps are hung high and work late at night. For example, the pipe laying project has been completed. It is said that the Capital Construction Committee plans to establish trams to run on major trunk roads to facilitate traffic.</p>
<h3 id="e168">New Interpretation of Proverbs <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— Cai Liang</p>
<p>▲ Easy come, easy go: The outbreak of the January 28th Shanghai War, some said that it originated from the insistence of the Chinese people on economic severance. Observing the repeated requests of the foreign affairs authorities of that country to ban anti-Japanese groups, there is no reason for this. However, after the signing of the ceasefire agreement, the enthusiasm of my compatriots to resist enemy goods suddenly declined, resulting in the activation of enemy goods, and the restoration of the original state. Five points of regret, it is sad to say. The most noteworthy thing is that after a large number of enemy goods were imported, they were sold out in an instant. If they are shipped to various places, they are also protected by warships and armed escorts. The plan is perfect. As the saying goes, easy come, easy go.</p>
<p>▲ Not crying for Dad until you see the coffin: My country has boycotted Japanese goods as many as nine times so far. Summing up the results, it is almost equal to zero. The lack of perfection in the organization of groups is difficult to maintain. The intentional disruption of successive奸商 is the biggest reason for failure. Recently, the national situation is in danger, which is very different from the past. All those with blood should be united against the enemy. Why are these people confused by profit and do not know how to repent? They are slaves to enemy goods, which is even worse than shunning them. It was not until the bombs of the Blood Soul Team were fired repeatedly that they heard of it and stopped. In this way, life is more important than money. Is it also the saying that you don't cry for your dad until you see the coffin?</p>
<p>▲ Enthusiastic people attract a lot of right and wrong: Recently, it was reported that Yun Huifang, a member of the Blood Soul除奸 Team in this port, was arrested for throwing bombs to warn 奸商. When he was escorted to the court, he stated in a candid manner that the righteousness of saving the country cannot be shirked, and the crime of warning 奸商 is deserved. Even if he treads on the legal net, he will not care. The listeners were all moved by it, and all admired the young man's courage of self-sacrifice. The country will not perish, all relying on this. However, in the eyes of the average old and prudent person, they will say that enthusiastic people attract a lot of right and wrong.</p>

<h3 id="e169">Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao (Part 1) <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— Gan Yi</p>
<p>Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao were teacher and disciple. Kang Youwei became famous for the Wanmu Caotang (Ten Thousand Trees Cottage), and Liang Qichao was known for the Yinbing Shi (Ice-Drinking Studio). Both of their graves are covered in green grass. The world has already forgotten the location where Kang Youwei lectured at Wanmu Caotang, but Liang Qichao's "Collected Works of the Ice-Drinking Studio" are known to almost every household. Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao had different orientations and their scholarship was also different, but their names, Kang and Liang, were linked together starting from the Reform Movement of 1898. Kang Youwei's original name was Zu Yi, with the courtesy names Changsu and Gengsheng, and another courtesy name, Gengshen. He adopted the meaning of Zixing's "Youwei" (meaning "to do" or "to act") and changed his name to Youwei. As for his courtesy name, he likened himself to a "Su Wang" (uncrowned king), showing his long-standing and sincere devotion and worship. Some say that Youwei often boasted that he possessed the qualities of Confucius. This is another interpretation. He was from Nanhai, Guangdong. He was appointed as a secretary in the Ministry of Works after passing the imperial examination. At that time, the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895 had just ended. Li Hongzhang, alarmed by foreign troubles, urgently sought peace. Youwei did not agree. He submitted a memorial detailing the gains and losses, arguing that defeat in war was a common occurrence, but seeking peace would only deepen the nation's humiliation. His suggestion was not adopted. His colleagues worried about his safety, so he feigned illness and left his post. Three years later, Dalian was seized by Russia, and Jiaozhou was seized by Germany. People were talking about the dismemberment of China. His liver burned with righteous indignation, which manifested in his expression. He submitted a memorial requesting ways to reform and strengthen the country. The Grand Secretary Weng Tonghe, who was in charge of the university, believed that he had caused the loss of the war and national humiliation and was unpopular in public opinion. He was paying close attention to those who were knowledgeable about foreign affairs and wanted to enlist his help. Therefore, he strongly recommended Youwei, saying that he had great talent. Hu Shengchen said that Youwei's talent was ten times greater. Emperor Dezong secretly glanced at Tonghe and said with tears in his eyes, "Youwei inevitably speaks grandly and exaggerates, but his talent is not being recognized. This can be seen between the lines of his memorial." The Empress Dowager did not like him and had no way to bring him into a key position. Moreover, his qualifications were still too shallow, so it would have to be done slowly. Later, Xu Zhijing, the Vice Minister of the Ministry of Rites, also praised his talent. Emperor Dezong then summoned him for an audience and ordered him to work as a secretary in the Office of the General Management of Affairs of Various Countries. Youwei was very dissatisfied because the six gentlemen, Tan Sitong, Lin Xu, Yang Rui, Liu Guangdi, Yang Shenxiu, and Kang Guangren, who were known at the time, had all been given positions as senior officials in the capital and were participating in the new policies. Guangren was Youwei's younger brother, and his reputation was far below his brother's, which made things even more difficult. Emperor Dezong initially wanted to use Yuan Shikai's army to protect himself and gradually implement reforms. The six gentlemen, being young and holding key positions, advocated for rapid progress, using the analogy of cutting tangled hemp with a sharp knife. Sitong was impatient and saw nothing as difficult. He secretly discussed with Shikai about killing Ronglu, using troops to surround the Summer Palace, and expelling the Empress Dowager to allow Emperor Dezong to rule in person. Ronglu was trusted by the Empress Dowager. The Empress Dowager hated the Emperor and also disliked the reform. Shikai pretended to agree but secretly revealed their plan to Ronglu. Ronglu then knocked on the palace gate late at night. The Empress Dowager was startled. Ronglu knelt on the ground, weeping and explaining the situation in detail. The Empress Dowager gritted her teeth and said, "Strike first! That is your responsibility!" Ronglu humbly agreed and retreated. The gentlemen were all executed. Youwei had already gone to Shanghai on business. Upon hearing the news, he changed his clothes, hid on a Western ship, and escaped to Hong Kong. He traveled to Europe and America, wrote "Travels in Eleven Countries," and established the Baohuang Party (Protect the Emperor Party). He raised funds from overseas Chinese. It is rumored that his accumulated wealth was very large, but it is not known for certain. He returned after the national crisis. He once published a long telegram discussing current affairs and published the "Bu Ren" (Cannot Bear) magazine to advocate the theory of Great Harmony. He still harbored resentment towards Shikai and wrote articles criticizing his fallacies. In order to win over people's hearts, Shikai intended to offer him a position in the Qing History Office. Youwei strongly declined, saying that "If I were to compile the history of the Qing Dynasty, Shikai would be the chief culprit. I cannot remain silent. Shikai would not tolerate it. I should do nothing." When Zhang Xun proposed the restoration of the monarchy, he invited Youwei to meet in Xuzhou. Youwei traveled by Jinpu Railway, covering his face with a palm-leaf fan among the vendors and coolies to avoid being recognized. Huang Pei happened to summon Xun to discuss major plans. Youwei secretly told Xun, "Now is the time. Delay will lead to failure." Xun then made up his mind and led his troops north. Youwei went with him. On the day they arrived in the capital, nearly a thousand people greeted them at the railway station. Xun went to visit Huang Pei and hinted that he should resign. Huang Pei did not realize what was happening and ordered Li Jingyi to reside in the Cabinet. Within three days, Xun helped the deposed Emperor Puyi ascend the throne, and the yellow dragon flag flew over the streets. People then realized that Xun had brought Youwei with him for this very purpose. A false decree appointed officials and granted Youwei the position of Deputy Director of the Bideyuan (Office for Assisting Virtue), which was a great disappointment to him. He publicly rebuked Xun for not understanding politics. After the failure, he fled to Shanghai. He wrote a letter to Xun saying, "We may never meet again." The meaning was clear. The government ordered his arrest, but he was spared due to the assistance of Qichao. While in Shanghai, he often held literary gatherings with Zhu Zumo, Shen Zengzhi, Zheng Su and others. Youwei said, "The best calligrapher of our time is Zeng Zhi, and the second best is me." From then on, he traveled extensively to the northwest frontier and then along the Yangtze River. He visited local officials everywhere, promoting culture. The officials admired his name and treated him generously. He gained some wealth and died in Jiaozhou by the sea. He was over seventy years old.</p>

<h3 id="e171">Sharp Rise in Gold Speculation <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>▲ Surpassing the 20 Taels Mark. Yesterday, the trend in gold speculation was sharp and the activity was lively. There were ups and downs throughout the day, but only a slight dip of five taels. Subsequently, it continued to rise by about nine taels, initially exceeding the 720 taels mark. This was because the silver market had fallen again and the exchange rate had also decreased. The resolve of traders was strong. The foreign exchange market was also stable, and the shorts made efforts to push forward, which further boosted the market. However, there were occasional fluctuations. At noon, news broke of a worsening situation, causing widespread panic. Selling pressure surged, and prices could not hold. Eventually, the 720 taels mark was broken, and the market turned flat, standing above 20 taels. The September contracts had dropped by one tael and seven or eight qian but later recovered to one tael and two or three qian, still posted by the shorts. For the October transactions, approximately 21,000 contracts were traded by various firms up to the previous day. The daily details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Opening with a Jump of 7 Taels and 4 Qian. The October contracts opened higher by 7 taels and 4 qian in the early morning, reaching 721 taels. This was because the large bars had shrunk by 1/16 to 1/8, and the silver price had decreased by 1/2. Private telegrams indicated that both spot and futures silver prices had fallen by 5/8, leading to a higher opening. Subsequently, it fell back by 5 qian and then rose again by 2 taels, driven by purchases from firms such as Da Xing and Yong Heng, reaching 22 taels and 8 qian. Later, Yuan Heng and others sold, and foreign exchange banks also sold, causing it to retreat to 21 taels. Soon, Bombay bought English gold for December at 193.75, and American gold for September was settled at only 68.75. With further purchases from Fu Yu and others, it reached 23 taels and 9 qian by 9:30 AM. The English gold remained unchanged, and the American gold was marked up by a small 1.25. From 23 taels and 1 qian to 24 taels, the domestic market was flat. Yuan Mao Yong sold, retreating to 22 taels and 5 qian. In an instant, it rose again by 2 taels due to efforts by Heng Yu and others to purchase, reaching 24 taels and 5 qian by 9:50 AM. Afterward, the momentum continued, with prices fluctuating up and down, but the difference was minimal, at most about 1 tael. The inflows and outflows of various parties were quite diverse. After 10:30 AM, Yi Feng and others sold, and Wan Xing also sold off, reaching 20 taels and 2 qian by 11:20 AM. Soon, Tong Tai Chang, Da Xing, and Yong Xu purchased, immediately raising it by more than 2 taels, reaching 22 taels and 8 qian by 11:30 AM. Shortly afterward, waves suddenly rose, with rumors of misunderstandings in Shanghai West. Selling pressure intensified, and Heng Xing, Yuan Mao Yong, and many small-scale long positions sold quickly. However, the exchange rate remained flat, while the gold price plummeted by more than 3 taels, breaking below 20 taels, reaching 19 taels and 5 qian. It then closed at 20 taels. Unexpectedly, after closing, it continued to rise to above 21 taels. The trajectory was unpredictable.</p>
<p>After opening at 21 taels, it retreated to 2 qian. The exchange rate seemed to loosen. August American gold was initially priced at 68.75, then settled at 75. Yuan Xing Yong, Da De Cheng and others bought, reaching 21 taels and 8 qian at 2:45 PM. Suddenly, Heng Xing and Yuan and others sold, causing the price to plummet by 2 taels, reaching 19 taels and 7 qian at 3:00 PM. Then, Hong Kang Yong and others bought in. Bombay telegraphed to buy September American gold at 75, reaching 22 taels and 2 qian at 3:45 PM. At that time, Heng Xing sold, immediately dropping it by 1 tael, to 21 taels and 2 qian. In an instant, Yong Feng and others bought, and the shorts rushed to cover. Yuan Kang Xiang and others also bought, and there was also a trend that silver prices on the 19th (today) might fall again. In just a few minutes, it jumped up 2 taels. When the market closed at 4:00 PM, it was 22 taels and 5 qian, and continued to rise 1 tael to 23 taels and 5 qian (goods were also priced high by 1 tael), an increase of 8 taels and 9 qian compared to the previous noon (the posted price). According to the whole day, the highest was 24 taels and 5 qian, and the lowest was 19 taels and 5 qian, a difference of 5 taels. Red bars increased by 9 taels, and the price was changed to 790 taels. American gold was marked up by a small 1.25, so it was suppressed by 66-67 taels to 70 taels. In the afternoon, it was 70 taels to 67 taels, less than the previous day by 7 taels. The months were all registered at 20 taels, with a supplementary payment of 19 taels. In the afternoon, it was 22 taels.</p>
<p>▲The trading on the platform was very active, with more buyers than sellers. According to statistics, Da Xing Yong, Zhi Feng Yong, Yuan Tai, Heng Xing Yuan, Xie Xing Yong, Fu Yu, Zhao Feng Chang, Fu Xing Yong, Yuan Da Yong, and speculator Wu, among others, bought in. Tong Tai Chang also bought more than 1,000 contracts to cover shorts. Yi Feng Yong, Yuan Heng, Shun Li, and Yuan Mao Yong sold out. Hong Kang Yong, Heng Chang Yong, Yuan Kang Xiang, and Fu Tai Heng, among others, all sold. Heng Yu and Yuan Chun saw mixed inflows and outflows. Yi Feng sold more than 400 contracts. In the afternoon, Yuan Xing Yong, Heng Chang Yong, Zhao Feng Chang, Hong Kang Yong, and Yuan Kang Xiang all bought in. Da Xing Yong, Yu He, Yuan Da Yong, and Yuan Mao Yong saw mixed inflows and outflows. Heng Xing, Bing Xing, Da Kang, and Zhi Feng Yong all sold out. The rest were mixed. On that day, the Dalian gang sold a total of 400 to 500 contracts and bought more than 200 contracts. The Guang Gang Heng Xing Yi Feng sold a total of more than 800 contracts and bought 200 to 300 contracts.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Strong Foreign Exchange Trends, Active Bank Transactions <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silver market fell again, and the exchange rate continued to decrease slightly. The trend in this port was steady. HSBC's listed price for American gold decreased by another 1.25, Dehe decreased by a small 2.5, Hong Kong increased by 2.5, and other currencies such as English, Indian, French, and Singaporean remained unchanged. The internal market was firm from the morning and continued to strengthen. The afternoon was flat, with no major changes. As a result, compared to the previous noon, English gold decreased by 1.875 and American gold decreased by 2.5. The gold market performed well, exceeding the 720 taels mark. Bank transactions were considered active, with 100,000 pounds of English gold traded. Gold gangs saw mixed inflows and outflows. British American Tobacco and Bombay both made purchases. Approximately 700,000 to 800,000 yuan of American gold were traded. Chinese merchants continued to arbitrage, speculating on gold prices. Silver companies bought near-term contracts, Bombay sold first and then bought, and various banks made slight offsetting transactions, which indicated a strong market trend.</p>
<p>▲The internal English exchange rate fluctuated by 1.25 throughout the day. The morning opened with a selling price of 1 shilling and 9 pence and 25 for August, 3125 for September, 375 for October, 4375 for November, and 9 pence and a half for December. The buying price was 9 pence 3125 to 5625. The closing selling price was 9 pence 125 to 375, and the buying price was 187 to 4375.</p>

<p>The market situation was quite lively in both the silver dollar and foreign currency markets yesterday. Transactions through money shops on behalf of banks were also considerable, as passenger routes and external uses gradually became more active. The financial sector became busier accordingly. The market price of foreign silver dollars also increased, and public sentiment shifted from relaxed to strong. Sellers did not show weakness, but buyers were even more aggressive. The market situation yesterday had a value worth recording.</p>
<p>▲ Higher Interest Rates, Stable Discount Rates. "Foreign silver dollar" interest rates in the early market were about 1 li higher than the afternoon market on the previous day, at 6 qian 8 fen 7 li 7 hao 5. The afternoon market increased by another 1 hao 2 hu and a half, at 6 qian 8 fen 7 li 8 hao 7 hu and a half. As a result, the two markets increased by a total of 1 li 1 hao 2 hu and a half. Because the silver supply was stable, there was no tightening or loosening, so the "silver discount" remained the same in both the early and afternoon markets, at 7 fen. A commission of 5 or 6 fen was added.</p>
<p>▲ Jiangnan Coins Fall and Rise Again. Jiangnan small silver dollars did not have any major activity, but recently there have been significant fluctuations. Yesterday, the early market fell below the 6 qian mark, at 5 qian 9 fen 9 li and a half. The afternoon market rose by half a li, counted as 6 qian and no li. Transactions were 4,500 jiao in the early market and 5,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Guangdong small silver dollars were 5 qian 8 fen 1 li 2 hao and a half in the early market and 5 qian 8 fen 1 li 6 hao 2 hu and a half in the afternoon market. As a result, it was slightly higher by 1 li. Transactions were 120,000 jiao in the early market and 40,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins continued to increase by 500 wen, to 432,500 wen.</p>

<p>Other Small Bonds Fell by 7 Jiao...Transactions Were 3,000,000</p>
<p>Yesterday's trading situation at the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange. The spot market was very weak, with only one transaction for the "19 Customs" bond at 1,000 yuan in the morning. There was no trading for the rest. The futures market was also not as good as before. The mood of buyers and sellers was slightly cooler than before. The early market opened at 1,765,000 yuan, and the late market was 1,300,000 yuan, for a total of 3,130,000 yuan. As for the situation with the various bonds, the situation in the North had new disturbances. Zhang resigned, which was concerning. The brutality of the Japanese seemed to be increasing. As a result, market demand was not strong. There were few buyers, but many sellers were eager to sell, so the supply exceeded demand, and the market became a short squeeze situation, as term transactions were gradually increasing. The trends in the prices of the various bonds were extremely stable, and the fluctuations in the early and late markets were still small. The military reduction bonds fell by 9 jiao and a half, which was the most significant. Other bonds fell by about 6 or 7 jiao. The bond market situation was very chaotic.</p>

<h3 id="e176">Cotton Yarn Market Entered a Good Phase in the Afternoon <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market was weak in the morning and rose in the afternoon, but the demand from customers remained weak. Judging from the overall situation, except for the Changjiang gang, other gangs had less hope of purchasing. The southern port gangs had already absorbed enough and currently had no desire to buy more. The Huabei region was occupied by Japanese merchants. Therefore, the outlet for yarn in this short period was not expected to be smooth. However, buyers were very interested because raw cotton prices were trending upwards.</p>
<p>▲Man Biao Rose by 6, 7, and 8 Qian. After the opening of the auction for the current month in the Man Biao market in the early market, the market was temporarily chaotic and a storm arose. Several brokers had transactions with a certain foreigner, and the other brokers strongly opposed it. For a while, the auction could not open. In the afternoon, the broker expressed remorse and returned to the market. The storm was temporarily calmed. In the early market of the yarn auction, prices rose and fell by 1-2 qian. In the afternoon, due to cotton going up, the market became firmer. Prices for each month rose by 4, 5, 7 qian to 1 liang. The total transactions for the day were estimated to be 12,900 bales. Da Feng sold 400 bales, Zhen Da sold 400 bales, Ren Feng sold 550 bales, Jin Da sold 550 bales, Yuan Tai sold 400 bales. Ming De bought 450 bales, Shen Ji bought 450 bales, Yong Da bought 750 bales, and Da Chang Cheng bought 400 bales. The closing prices are listed below.</p>

<p>The cotton market fell in the morning and rose in the afternoon. Although American cotton fell slightly, silver prices shrank again, leading to very strong buyer sentiment. Buyers continued to buy during the falls. Therefore, the market plate was small, and there were many buyers. It was also rumored that a certain foreign cotton merchant was secretly conducting business in the market, which strengthened the bullish forces. Overall, the situation for foreign cotton was stable, and people expected prices to rise. However, the weather has been favorable recently, and the production of new cotton is still in good condition.</p>
<p>▲Zheng Biao Rose by 4 Qian and a Half. At the opening of the Zheng Biao auction in the early market, prices for each month fell by 5 fen to 2 qian due to a slight drop in American cotton and weak sentiment. The market atmosphere suddenly changed in the afternoon, with prices rising by 3-4 qian. Total transactions for the day were 49,500 dan. Yuan Da sold 2,100 dan, Yu Chang sold 2,000 dan, Ren Feng sold 1,400 dan, Ji Feng sold 1,300 dan, Yi Chang sold 1,100 dan.

<p>Yesterday, American cotton was initially weak due to unfavorable news from Liverpool and a downturn on Wall Street. It later recovered due to short covering. Futures fell by 11-14 points, and spot fell by 10 points. British cotton futures and spot both fell by 9 points. Egyptian cotton spot was unchanged. Indian cotton was weak due to unfavorable opening in Liverpool and profit-taking. Pingguoer and Aomula fell by 5.5 rupees, and Bairoxi fell by 4.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram from the 17th).</p>

<p>New Japonica Rice Fell by 2 Jiao</p>
<p>▲Yesterday, the sources of various gangs in South Shanghai came from the numbers, and the amount stored at Pu was slightly larger. Sales in urban and rural areas were even more sluggish. The situation for thick Japonica rice was topping out, and it was slightly weaker by nearly a jiao. There were no rises or falls in early and late rice. The downstream situation, the new Japonica rice arriving was strong, and prices were short by 2 chi. Foreign Du was rare, and the opening set the tone. It turned dark, and the supply of the essential yuan was lacking.</p>
<p>The source on New Gate West Road was 16 or 17. Sales in the city were not very weak, because silver was unusually tight, and customer prices fell. Goods from Kunshan, Jiangyin, Yixing, etc., were lower by 2 or 3 chi. Changzhou and Wuxi North Japonica rice had slightly better stacking. The situation was stable. The arrival and sales of early thin rice were balanced, and there was no upward or downward movement. New Japonica rice was similar to the South Market.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Starch Speculation was Quiet and Weak <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the starch market in the morning and afternoon, the various months generally showed a hovering trend. Foreign wheat quotations were slightly higher or lower by about 1 or 2 jiao. External buying interest had stopped. Furthermore, sales to the North had stopped. Futures inflows and outflows did not affect the market. As for the factories, they still intended to continue selling based on existing inventory. Unfortunately, there were very few buyers, and they were unable to sell, so everyone excluded each other and transactions became rare. Looking at future trends, foreign wheat seemed to be coming to China. Future changes would depend on foreign trends. As a result, the current month was slightly lower by 2.5 li, October was slightly lower by 5 li, and January was slightly lower by 2.5 li. The rest did not rise or fall.</p>
<h3 id="e182">The Price of Wheat Exhibits Weakness in Near Months and Firmness in Distant Months <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market saw weakness in the near months and firmness in the distant months in both the morning and afternoon sessions. For the current month, sellers have prepared a large number of deliveries, estimated at over forty truckloads. However, on the receiving side, only one factory is prepared for about twenty truckloads, and the rest are uncertain. As a result, market sentiment is weak, and prices continue to decline. In the distant months, due to the failure to reach an agreement on Australian wheat, outsiders are buying in, leading to firmer market sentiment. Consequently, the price for the current month fell three points compared to the previous day, while September remained unchanged. October, November, and December each gained one point. Currently, the wheat market is actively trading and shows a steady trend. Yangzhou wheat opened at 3.42 taels, wheat at 3.5 taels, and Shaoxing wheat at 3.33 taels, totaling over 1,600 bags, reportedly handled by Fuxin and Huafeng companies.</p>
<h3 id="e183">The First Batch of Xiang Jing Rice Arrives in Shanghai <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>▲ Small Grain Rice Drops Sharply by Two or Three Jiao</p>
<p>▲ Wen Tai Rice to Arrive Soon</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market experienced an even greater decline. Small grain rice plummeted by a substantial two or three jiao in both the morning and afternoon. This was because the first batch of Hunan Jingjiang rice had arrived, totaling about 400 bags, imported by Jardine Matheson's Dehe vessel. Both polished and unpolished rice each accounted for half, and were sold by merchants such as Yutai and Tai Min. It is expected to appear in the market around today or tomorrow. According to sources in the Wen Tai region, the new rice in Taiwan is mostly leftover from previous harvests, and some will soon be shipped to Shanghai for sale. The market already has ample foreign rice inventory, and sales are sluggish. Now, with the arrival of Hunan and Zhejiang rice in Shanghai, market sentiment is inevitably affected. However, the cost of Hunan rice is high, and whether the supply can continue is also a question. A total of 4,000 bags of small grain rice were traded throughout the day, priced at 9.12 yuan to 8.95 yuan. Old small grain rice was priced at 9 yuan. 200 bags of Saigon No. 1 were priced at 9.8 yuan. Among them, 2,000 bags of small grain rice were handled by Ningbo merchants, while the rest were handled by local merchants and those from Chongsha.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the local foreign merchant silk market saw brisk sales and rising prices. This was due to telegrams from New York regarding yellow and white filature, which prompted British and French speculators to increase their hoarding. Qianli, Lanlebi, and others imported 120 bales of medium-grade B-grade white filature with an average evenness of 81 to 86 points.</p>
<p>The price ranged from 540 to 595 taels. Jardine Matheson, Dachang, and others imported 60 bales of top-grade B-grade white filature with an evenness of 13 to 15 points, priced from 580 to 620 taels. They also imported 80 bales of Sichuan yellow filature made by iron machinery with an evenness of 13 to 15 points, priced at 560 taels.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Needle and Eyebrow Green Tea Rise Firmly <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign firms and local firms were vigorously purchasing needle, eyebrow, and show eyebrow green tea from various origins, including Jardine Matheson, Xiehe, Jinlong, and Yongxing. The market was firm and sales prices rose by another two or three taels. Wuyuan wholesalers, with strong sales in the American market, were experiencing tight market conditions. However, Pingshui tea did not seem to show any improvement. Local tea merchants have been demanding higher prices for top and medium-grade Zhenmei green tea, but there has been no response from overseas telegrams, and the market situation has not seen any special progress. The situation for other goods, such as pearl tea and tribute tea, remains stable.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Hardware Firms Offer Discounts to Clear Ordered Goods <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>The hardware market last spring saw excellent market conditions, leading various foreign firms to place large orders with hardware merchants, even doubling and tripling orders with manufacturers. As a result, the volume of goods arriving in the autumn and winter of last year was unprecedented in recent years. Meanwhile, the value of the shilling first plummeted and then surged, causing significant losses for importers. Consequently, they were hesitant to request the delivery of ordered goods. Later, the outbreak of war lasted for two or three months, further exacerbating the already difficult circumstances for foreign firms, making it impossible to urge customers to take delivery. Almost a year has passed, and to clear their inventory, the foreign firms are forced to offer discounts and urge customers to take delivery. Currently, British, American, German, and French merchants are voluntarily offering price reductions to expedite the delivery of goods. It is reported that dozens of foreign firms have been offering discounts to clear their inventories in recent days.</p>

<p>▲ Raw Sugar and White Sugar Trade Quietly, Market Firm</p>
<p>Yesterday, trading at the Sugar Market Association's market was sluggish. Dutch sugar No. 24 raw white traded at 14.55 taels, while those unable to sell were priced at 14.3 taels. Demand was low, and the market appeared flat. Dutch raw red sugar No. 14 was priced at 12.65 taels, and Dutch red sugar Nos. 8 and 9 were priced at 10.067 taels, with sparse trading. The market trend was weak. Taikoo sugar trading was even quieter. B mark was priced at 16.25 taels, CW at 15.7 taels, DY mark at 15.5 taels, HX mark at 15.15 taels, and PX mark at 11.2 taels. The market appeared firm. Dachang offered 300 tons of bowl blue Dutch sugar for September shipment at a price of 3.075 Dutch currency per dan. Liji offered 200 tons of Dutch red sugar Nos. 8 and 9 for immediate shipment at a price of 4 yuan. Both prices excluded taxes. Market sentiment was flat. Trading was still sparse. Hong Kong No. 1 ice flower blue was offered at 13 taels, but few inquired. Local goods were priced at 12.8 or 9 taels, with lukewarm interest. The market appeared quite bleak and lacking.</p>

<p>▲ Market Prices Consistently Loosen</p>
<p>▲ Sichuan Preserved Vegetables: Since the new crop came out, arrivals and inventories have been abundant, but sales have been just average, leading to loosening customer prices. Ordinary new vegetables were initially offered at 21.5 yuan, but are now selling at 20 to 20.5 yuan, while better quality ones are at 21 yuan. ▲ Celestial Rice: Recently, new goods have continued to arrive, but the market is very sluggish, making it difficult for prices to rise. Currently, clear water goods are selling at 160 taels, while ordinary goods with rice water are at 110 taels. ▲ Orchid Bamboo Shoots: Recent arrivals have been increasing, but sales are being hampered by Jinshan shoots, causing market prices to loosen. Shoots with the top mark are offered at 22 taels, with subsequent grades being lower. Buyers are hoping for improved quality to compete with Jinshan shoots.</p>

<h3 id="e191">On Speaking <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>Speaking is most difficult, first one must consider the person's position and character.</p>
<p>1. It is easy to speak from the position of an observer, and difficult to speak from the position of an authority.</p>
<p>2. It is easy to speak when out of power, because one is not responsible; it is difficult to speak when in power, because one must be responsible.</p>
<p>3. It is easy for an employer to speak to a servant, whether the words are appropriate or not; it is difficult for a servant to speak to an employer, appropriate words are acceptable, but inappropriate words may lead to dismissal.</p>
<p>4. It is easy to speak without taking responsibility, because the words are not binding and do not necessarily need to be acted upon; it is difficult to speak responsibly, because once spoken, one should be responsible for carrying them out.</p>
<p>5. It is easy to speak when right is on one's side, because one's righteousness strengthens one's confidence; it is difficult to speak when one is wrong, because it is hard to justify oneself.</p>
<p>6. It is difficult to speak with a calm mind and quiet breath, words must be considered carefully; it is easy to speak in anger, because one disregards everything.</p>
<p>7. It is easy to speak to barbarians, because they do not reason; it is difficult to speak to civilized people, one must speak according to reason.</p>
<p>8. It is easy to speak to those who understand reason, one can speak according to reason; it is difficult to speak to those who do not understand reason, because there is no logic to explain.</p>

<p>The scorching sun hangs high in the sky, lotus flowers emerge from the water, undeterred by the heat, they still compete to show their beauty, radiantly red. (Sun Lotus)</p>
<p>People accustomed to enjoying lotus in the pond for cooling, only then realize the heat has passed. They envy the pure and clean nature of this flower, with its delicate and simple shadow reflecting on the moonlit waves. (Moon Lotus)</p>
<p>Standing tall and straight in the center of the water, gracefully fragrant and unrestrained, a gust of wind comes and rocks it unsteadily, suddenly turning and skimming across the silvery pond. (Wind Lotus)</p>
<p>From ancient times, a gentleman is known for his pure heart, untouched by dust or contamination. When is its color and fragrance best? When it holds cool dew, wet and deep. (Dew Lotus)</p>

<h3 id="e194">The Manufacturing Method of Shell Buttons <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Zhuo Tao</p>
<p>The introduction of shell buttons to China is only about twenty years ago. In recent years, the demand for shell buttons has increased rapidly. Taking Shanghai as an example, the annual import of shell buttons from Japan is about 400,000 yuan, not to mention other countries. In recent years, there has been some attention, but the production is very small and the quality is poor, which is not enough to resist imports. There has been no accurate survey and statistics on the origin and amount of shell button raw materials in China, which gives us no way to investigate, but it is known that the production of bird shells in Tianjin, Hankou, Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and abalone in Shandong is quite abundant and of good quality. However, due to the underdeveloped shell button manufacturing industry, they are exclusively supplied to Japan as raw materials. It is heard that Japan's demand for shell button raw materials exceeds supply, and they often purchase from China and other parts of Southeast Asia. Their purchasing procedures are handled by Chinese merchants. It will not be difficult for us to purchase raw materials in the future. From this, it can be seen that the shell button manufacturing industry is very easy to develop and extremely beneficial to our country. Those who are ambitious should rise up and plan for it!</p>
<p>The manufacturing method of shell buttons varies depending on the type of raw material. However, the sequence of work is nothing more than: blank, grinding, edging, punching, bleaching, polishing, shining, and waxing. The following is a detailed description of each item in order:</p>
<p>(1) Blank: Blanking, commonly known as the first car, is the first step in shell button manufacturing, the embryonic form of the button shape. The machine is divided into power and foot-operated. The entire machine structure is rotary motion. Foot-operated is commonly used, with the right hand holding the drill bit up and down, and the left hand holding the shell, which is fixed on the receiving platform. Then, the foot steps on the rotation to move the entire machine, and at the same time, the drill bit is rotated down until it is drilled through. However, during blanking, the drill bit expands due to friction and heat, making it difficult to remove it temporarily, which not only makes the work difficult, but also easily loses the sharpness of the drill bit. Therefore, a water bucket must be attached to the machine to drip cold water for cooling.</p>
<p>(2) Polishing: The surface of the blank is mostly uneven, and without the procedure of grinding, it is very difficult for subsequent work. The machine is also divided into power and foot-operated, commonly known as the second car. The important parts are the flat circular emery wheel and the attached pusher. The blank is pushed by the pusher and pressed against the emery wheel, and the blank can be ground flat due to the rotation of the emery wheel.</p>
<p>(3) Edging: The style of the shell button varies depending on the edging. Place the flat blank into a cylindrical column, push the edging knife onto the blank surface, and rotate the cylindrical cutting tool to slowly edge the blank surface.</p>
<p>(4) Punching: The structure of the punching machine is very simple, similar to the edging machine, but its main shaft is four steel needles. The needle tip runs through a regular plate, and an iron frame with claws is attached to the front of the plate for placing the shell button. The pressing of the shell button is done with a flat iron strip, and it can be punched through in an instant after the foot is stepped on and rotated.</p>
<p>(5) Polishing: This stage of the project is to remove the sharp edges and corners and make the button surface smooth. Usually, a drum-shaped wooden bucket is used for rotation. The method is to first pour the shell buttons into the bucket, accounting for about two-thirds of the bucket, add clear water, two inches over the button surface, then add two handfuls of fine sand, and then close the bucket lid, and rotate continuously for several hours, or two days and nights, so that they rub against each other until they reach a smooth state.</p>
<p>(6) Bleaching: Bleaching relies on the power of chemicals to remove the dirt layer on the button surface and show the inherent luster of the shell button, which belongs to a chemical reaction. The ratio of chemical ingredients varies depending on the type of shell button. Here is a common example:</p>
<p>Water: 10 pounds. Sodium percarbonate: 5 spoons. Sulfuric acid: until the litmus paper turns red.</p>
<p>Water glass: until the litmus paper turns blue. Magnesium sulfate: about 10 spoons.</p>
<p>Place the shell button in the above-mentioned solution and keep it at 70-80 degrees with a gentle fire for one day and night to obtain it.</p>
<p>(7) Shining: Although the shell button manufacturing has gone through the above-mentioned procedures, the luster is still dull, and it must be reprocessed. Place the bleached shell button in a 4% solution mixed with hydrochloric acid and Farmali, etc., and rotate for 20-30 minutes. Take it out, wash it, boil it in boiling water again, and then put it in a shining bucket to strengthen the hydrochloric acid rotation. If a little ferric chloride is added, the luster will be better. After the rotation is complete, put it in clear water to cool it.</p>
<p>(8) Waxing: Waxing is another shining procedure after drying. The method is to first put the shining shell buttons into a cloth bag, add wax wood chips, and two people hold each other and shake back and forth for half an hour, then take them out and sieve them to separate them.</p>
<p>The manufacturing method of shell buttons is now complete. However, relying solely on academics without experience, the resulting products will definitely not be good. Therefore, rich experience is required to obtain good results. Academics and experience are complementary and go hand in hand.</p>

<h3 id="e195">My Opinion on Improving Graves <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Yunzong</p>
<p>Ever since Guo Pu of the Jin Dynasty wrote a book on burial and created the theory of feng shui, ignorant people have regarded the burial of dead people's coffins as the key to the rise and fall, wealth and poverty, nobility and humbleness of a family. Since then, they have spared no effort in choosing tomb sites. Especially wealthy families, for a few coffins, specially hire famous geomancers to select places with good feng shui to build Yin houses, spending thousands or tens of thousands of dollars is not considered rare!</p>
<p>As a result, now when we walk into the fields, we see a grave every five steps and a tomb every ten steps. A good piece of farmland is often occupied by a "dirt mound." I think that if this continues, the harm will not be small!</p>
<p>What are the harms of graves? (1) Increase superstition: People believe in feng shui, value graves, and must spend a lot of effort on burying coffins. They want to seek happiness from the dark, and compete to believe in each other, and the evil habit of superstition is deepening! Moreover, with graves, they have to engage in ghost worship every year! (2) Waste money and time: Choosing a grave site requires hiring a geomancer, buying land, building a grave, and building a grave house, wasting a lot of money and time! (3) Reduce production: Farmland is the mother of produce. With more graves, many fields are occupied, and produce naturally decreases. Our country is based on agriculture, but agricultural produce is in short supply, relying on foreign goods. This is also one of the reasons!</p>
<p>The harm of graves is so great! Then we must hurry up and improve it!</p>
<p>Improvement measures: (1) The government shall order the existing graves to be excavated and reclaimed for cultivation. (2) The government shall delineate areas to establish public cemeteries and order the people to bury their coffins there. (3) Those who do not comply with the order shall be fined.</p>
<p>After abolishing private graves and implementing the public cemetery system, there are three benefits:</p>
<p>(1) Superstition can be eradicated.</p>
<p>(2) Money and time can be saved.</p>
<p>(3) Production can be increased.</p>
<p>My humble opinion is like this, what do you all think? Please participate in the discussion!</p>

<h3 id="e196">Internal Contradiction <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Ren</p>
<p>K graduated from high school. After he completed his graduation examination and was looking forward to receiving his diploma, he often proudly thought in his heart: With his qualifications and abilities, finding a job in society would definitely be welcomed everywhere. On his brow, there was often a shadow of joy and hope.</p>
<p>This is an old saying, but now it has become an unchanging definition: "Reality is contrary to desire: the greater the desire, the greater the disappointment." K stepped into the threshold of society, and he gradually admitted this sentence. But he did not show weakness, nor did he feel discouraged, he persisted. It is said that recently he has been introduced to work in a certain organization doing desk work. I was happy for him and was about to write him a letter of congratulations when I unexpectedly received his letter first. The letter was written like this, and in his handwriting, there was a lot of anger and bitterness.</p>
<p>Dear friend;</p>
<p>Without a job, looking for a job, no matter what job, I am willing to do it; having got a job, but unable to do it satisfactorily</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>. This internal contradiction, young people have generally deeply felt the pain. The so-called mature and prudent elders, they will put on an iron face and scold, "Young people are absolutely unreliable, they are fickle and change their minds, where do they understand the spirit of service?......" However, I think, are young people not people? Young people should not be an exception to want to live! Friend! This mechanical and absolutely uninteresting work is the graveyard of young people! Rather than being stuck in the graveyard, wouldn't it be more sacred to sell my strength?</p>
<p>Perhaps you will advise me to be quieter and wait, "wait for the arrival of opportunity." But, friend, what a vague noun this "waiting" is! And "opportunity" and "arrival" are even more words to deceive the weak! However, I know clearly that this is vague, this is deception, but, what can I do to open it?</p>
<p>"Weak young man, who told you to run into this cruel and absolutely inhuman so-called human society? Since you are here, why not be brave and fight your enemies, attack, and get your food? Who is to blame for this?" When I was depressed and helpless, a mass of pitch-black things rolled in front of me, making a ghost face and also like a serious general, mocking and encouraging me. Friend, I have never wanted to extricate myself? Sometimes I even prepare to do it. However, what is the result? This unfortunate result will often make you imagine that you have escaped from this so-called society, this so-called human being, and gone alone to a deserted island—</p>
<p>A deserted island without a little bit of a trace of a cursed so-called creature and spirit, with disheveled hair and bare feet, naked, frantically running, jumping, rolling, roaring, shouting... it seems that if I die, everything will be clean...</p>

<h3 id="e197">Recruiting Teachers <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Yong</p>
<p>Since Mr. K graduated from XX Normal School, he has not found a position yet... Yesterday, he took a piece of news from the classified ads of the newspaper and told me...</p>
<p>"Old C... Look, isn't this an opportunity? But I feel strange, to... the..." I took it over and looked at it, it wrote...</p>
<p>"This school is now planning to recruit several teachers. Those who are willing to apply, please go to Mr. X at No. X Lane X XX Road to contact, and need to pay a deposit of 20 yuan..."</p>
<p>After I read it, I felt inexplicable in my heart, and I couldn't help but suspect again. Finally, I said to Mr. K, "This is probably a trick... How can teachers require a deposit... I can't believe it. You should look for other opportunities. Don't be fooled. Sacrificing 20 yuan is a small matter. It's really not worth it to be a fool..." But Mr. K had been unemployed for a long time and was eager to find a job, so he didn't listen to me and went to apply.</p>
<p>Three days later, Mr. K came back dejectedly and said to me, "Old C, I regret not listening to you. Now I have been fooled. Not only can I not find a job, but I have also lost 20 yuan and become a big fool... Really unlucky, this 20 yuan was borrowed by my mother, I am really sorry for her," I persuaded him on the one hand and asked him about the situation on the other. He told me...</p>
<p>"I ran to Shanghai and found No. X Lane X XX Road. When I opened the door, it turned out to be a small kiosk. Sitting inside was a young man in his twenties wearing a suit. He asked me my intention and asked me to write three resumes and pay 20 yuan as a so-called teacher's deposit. The young man said... I will send you a letter in three days to let you know whether to hire you or not, because there are already more than 30 applicants, but there are only three positions. If you are not qualified, the deposit can be returned..." So I came back and waited at home for three days. There was no notification, so I thought I was not qualified, so I went to Shanghai to get back the deposit. Unexpectedly, when I got there, the door was also closed, and the person was no longer there. A notice for rent was posted on the door. At that time, I realized that I had been deceived, but it was too late..."</p>
<p>After listening to his words, I felt quite unfair in my heart, but what can I do? I had to comfort him, "One more failure, one more experience."</p>
