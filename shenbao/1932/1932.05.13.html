<h3 id="c1">從國際情勢談到中蘇復交彬 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>昨評旣已辯明中蘇復交與同意於共産主義爲兩事。今請更從國際情勢上申述中蘇復交之必要。　　自歐戰結束而後。國際政治之重心。已移至太平洋一。而中國之成爲太平洋問題之重心。則已爲世人所共認。在目前資本主義已步入根本上之危機。資本主義之世界中。簡直無一國不爲空前之大批失業者。空前之生産過剩。財政金融紊亂破産國内外貿易激减等殘酷之事實所共悶。無一國不開展鉅大之經濟恐慌。隨此鉅大之恐慌以俱來者。即爲重新分割市塲之準備尖鋭化。而由準備重新分割市塲所必然引起之資本主義國家間之火併。亦日益尖鋭化。在此情形之下。而太平洋上之風雲乃日益緊急。換言之。即中國問題乃日趨於嚴。重自去年九一八今年一二八以至目前國際間之明爭暗鬥。法日間之諒解。英美之携手。美日之衝突。無不爲中國問題所誘致。質言之。即無不爲準備分割中國之前哨戰。而日本之决然實力發動强佔東北。進犯淞滬。其爲欲獨覇遠東。并積極準備發動資本主義國家間之戰爭及資本主義與社會主義之戰爭。更爲顯明。　　試問我國今日在外交上之與國何在。非完全陷於孤立之地位乎。處於如斯嚴重情勢之下。其將坐待强鄰之宰割乎。抑應從速樹立新的外交方針以謀應付來日之大難乎。今日我國當前之壓迫爲日本。新的外交方針。自應以聨合以平等待我之民族。保全領土行政主權之完整爲基礎。法旣與日有諒解之説。英與意亦無力東顧。美日衝突。雖日益激化。美可引爲我之與國。但亦有鞭長莫及之憂。獨有蘇聨爲太平洋問題中最應注目之一要角。自彼革命而後。且自動宣告放棄舊俄時代與我訂立之一切不平等條約。并地理上天然爲我之與國。蓋無可置疑。我對蘇聨復交。在外交之局勢上。可收互相依庇之效。德土交蘇聨而得以打破外交上之艱局。即其例證。以地大物博民衆之兩大。如一旦復交。則太平洋上之局勢。自爲之大變。故我國今日如不甘坐待宰割。則新的外交方針必以此爲基礎。　　即退一步言。自蘇聨革命成功而後列强始則實行軍事干涉。繼則期待其復返於資本主義之舊軌。今則以其五年計劃之厲行。國勢日欣欣以向榮。雖嫉之倍切。但對彼在外交上或經濟上。亦不得不發生密切之關係。蘇聨在目前亦由進取之外交政策。退而爲防守之外交政策。如與土耳其·德國·阿富汗·里斯亞尼亞·波斯·立陶宛·芬蘭·法國等均簽訂不侵條約。美國今亦有異蘇聨復交之聲浪。世界各國對蘇聨者旣如此。我國究持·有何種特殊理由。而仍閉門不與通往來。抑且處於今日國際關係互相綜錯不可分離之情勢下。不從新的外交政策上謀正當之應付。徒閉門拒人。斯眞爲一種極愚笨之外交政策。日本自去年九一八以後。對我不宣而戰。我政府當局。尚努力維持兩國間一線之邦交。是則對蘇復交。詎尚容再躊躇乎。</p>

<p>見（續）王造時反對結束訓政的第三個理由，説過去的憲政，成績不好，所以現在不應實行憲政。其實過去何會眞正實行過憲政。汪氏自已也説袁世凱及北洋軍閥官僚政客們，破壞了憲政。那麽成續不好，乃是没有實行憲政的結果。如果實行憲政，又何至有袁世凱的稱帝，國會的被解散，軍閥的互相火併，以至於孫中山在廣東做非常總統。這些事實，正是證明憲政的必要，與破壞及反對憲政者的罪惡。汪于兩氏，旣痛駡破壞憲政的官僚政客於前，又爲何自己做反對實行憲政的官僚政客於後？　　反對結束訓政的第四個理由，説現在有些主張憲政的人，是從前的官僚政客，他們不配談憲政。中國現在應否結束訓政，實行憲政，是一事；從前的官僚政客，配談憲政與否又是一事。如果中國應實行憲政，那麽無論那個談，都應實行的。不能（以人廢言），更不能（因噎廢食）。對事對人，應該分開。何况從前的官僚政客，未必壞於現在的官僚政客呢。　　上面所駁反對結束訓政的理由，都是汪于兩氏共同的意見，不過汪氏更説得明顯有條理罷了。此外汪于兩氏還有些話，有分别糾正的必要。　　譬如汪精衛氏説：（···當時臨時約法憲法，都是國民黨黨員製造出來，制裁袁世凱和鞏固民國的基礎的所以他們要打倒國民黨，便要破壞憲政。這樣看來，國民黨及汪氏自己原來是主張憲政的，並且認爲破壞憲政的人是不對的。那麽現在汪氏又爲什麽要反對憲政，痛駡主張憲政的人？難道現在一般國民的程度，反不如民國初年的時候嗎？抑是因爲以前國民黨，没有拿到政權，所以製造臨時約法憲法出來制裁袁世凱。現在因爲政權已經到手，所以痛駡主張憲政來制裁一黨專政和鞏固民國的人　　又譬如汪氏説：（···中國至今還没憲政，但這是什麽原故呢？這是自從民國以來，憲政都被他們一次，二次，三次破壞盡了）。北京政府時代，憲政之不能實行，從前的官僚政客，固不能不負一部分責任；但是最大的阻力，還是袁世凱及其遺留的北洋軍閥，這是汪氏要認清楚的。而自從國民黨執政以來，完全不要憲政，改民國爲黨國，又是誰之過呢。從前的官僚政客，充其量，不過是破壞憲政罷了。現在的官僚政官，根本就不要憲政。汪氏何以（明於責人，闇於責己？　　再譬如汪氏説：（由民國十七年或十八年訓政開始起，至今只有三年的時期，如果没有内部的糾紛，當然可以做得比較好些。但是以中國之大，其範圍之遼闊，情形之複雜，若謂以一二年便可以將中國完全做好，這是誰也做不到的）。其實自國民黨專政以來，至今已有六年。（以中國之大），我們當然不應希望將中國完全做奸。但是國民黨現以革命黨自居，以訓政爲名，至少總要比北京政府時代做得好一點，才有資格駡人，才有資格訓政。但是請問，外交内政，那處能够比得上從前？只有貪污的程度，内亂的迅速，及賣國的手段，比從前利害罷了汪氏没有上臺的時候，攻擊南京政府没有成績、比任何人都兇。現在汪氏上臺了，擁護南京政府，也比任何人都兇。何前後矛盾若是？其實國民黨做得不好，（有事實可以證明的）。汪氏自何嘗不明白。就是所謂（内部的一切糾紛），都是你們國民黨文武同志自己閙出來的、都是以訓政自居的先知先覺閙出來的。汪氏自己的翻來覆去，特别要負嚴重責任，與我們小民何干，何涉。汪氏毫無悔過之心，不承認國民黨及他自己有絲毫的過錯，好像還要把罪狀擱在我們一般國民的頭上。這話從何説來？　　至於于右任氏的話，更有許多莫名其妙。茲簡單指出其錯誤之大者：（一）誠如孫哲生氏所言（于先生最大錯悞，就是不能承認本黨（國民黨）以往的過失，以爲本黨還是一個健全的革命黨，因此他便有本黨之能領導中國國民革命，自是基於客觀事實之决定）。其實國民黨現在爲軍閥官僚政客所盤據，不但不能領導革命，並且事實上日趨反革命而在被人革命之列。（二）（本黨所求之憲政，乃革命之憲政，乃革命之憲法；而惟有革命之人民，乃克受之，行之耳）。讀遍政治學籍，查盡各國字典，恐找不出（革命之憲政）名詞。稍有政治常識，即知（憲政與（革命）不能相容。憲政之下不容革命；革命之下，不顧憲政。至於（革命之人民）更不要什麽憲法憲政，今日我們之所以主張結束訓政，實行憲政，正是不革命之人民，要求不革命之憲政耳。我們若是眞革起命來，何暇談什麽憲政憲法？到了那時，就是國民黨如滿清末年匆匆預備立憲，我們也必如先總理所行置之不理，至於（受之，行之），更是談不到矣。（三）（在此國難期間，使國人監督政治，導國人參加政治，實爲天經地義之事）。若國人參政爲天經地義，則應結束訓政實施民治。但于氏一面説人民參政是天經地義，一面又説國民黨訓政是天經地義。到底那個是天經地義？請于氏有以語我來。其實有黨治，便没有民治，有民主政治，便没有一黨專政。兩者同時不能做天經地義。（四）（黨以民主集權之形式治黨治政，猶虞散漫不給，顧何取於民主政治之虚名，而受無組織之實禍乎）？就此點看來，于氏根本上就不相信民主政治，認爲民主組織散漫，有害無利，黨用之（猶虞不給），國用之將受（實禍）。由此推論，于氏的思想，不但要主張國民黨專政，並且要主張個人獨裁，以至於君主專制。（五）于氏認爲結束訓政，實行憲政，乃是共産黨，與國家主義派的主張，爲這兩派張目。其實共産黨根本就不管什麽訓政憲政。他們的手段，老實不客氣。是要革掉國民黨的命。國家主義派雖然比較和緩，但是也不很熱心於此，因爲他們也在準備革命的武力。只有像我這種手無寸鐵的教書匠，及態度温和的人才，來向國民黨談什麽訓政與憲政。（六）于氏反對資産階級的民主政治。但是什麽呌做資産階級的民主政治？仠麽是非資産階級的民主政治？于氏並没有交代一句。但國民黨現在的訓政，根據于氏的腦筋，恐怕我們連求資産階級的民主政治也不可得。至於于氏所謂（革命之憲政），（直欺騙民衆而已）。（七）于氏痛毁民元之約法與曹錕的憲法，但是一九三一年國民黨御用的國民會議所通過的國民約法，請于氏回顧一回顧，又何如乎？口口聲聲駡他人爲（軍閥），爲（官僚），爲（此時代之遺骸），（革命之塵滓），于氏其反躬自視，並視今日的國民黨，又是什麽乎？舊官僚政客，今日起來主張憲政，誠如于氏所言，未必有（席政權）之理。但其爲（出墟墓），反人魂，我不敢拒絶。所怕者，今日之（軍閥）（官僚）（此時代之遺骸）（革命之塵滓），連想假訓政（席政權），（入墟墓）耳。可不悲哉！　　至於我爲什麽要主張結束訓政，實行憲政，及對於孫哲生氏的意見的批評，當另有文字發表。</p>

<p>前天的午後，有位外國太太同時和我走上一輛電車，這位外國太太，老態龍鐘，頭髮雪白，她在我對面的人縫裏落了座。那時，我走得十分疲乏，便揀了一個空位坐了下來。過了一站走上一位大腹便便的商人和一位女人。那位大腹便便的商人，眼尖脚快，三脚兩步便在我身旁落了坐，把脚一蹺，便横轉身來朝着窗外看熱閙。這位落了第的女人，只好眼巴巴的立在那兒候補缺。對面那位外國太太，看了不服氣，把鼻子嗅嗅，嘴裏喃喃的説着些什麽，我已猜到她的心意。果然，她拿起手中的拐杖來向着那位商人揚了一揚，意思是呌他坐正，讓個空位給這位女人。但他似理不理的，把脚一放，仍然朝着窗外觀望。外國太太可氣了，嘴裏喃喃不絶，但聽不出她説什麽。有一位留着八字鬚的同胞，在人背後嘲笑似的説；（好一位多管閒事的老太婆！）　　過了不久（哇）的一聲，忽然在這位外國太太身旁出了什麽事，我車忙一看不出她説什麽。有一位留着八字鬚的同胞，在人背後嘲笑似的説；（好一位多管閒事的老太婆！）　　過了不久（哇）的一聲、忽然在這位外國太太身旁出了什麽事，我連忙一看，原來是她身旁的一位女同胞吐了一口痰，而且（咳···）不斷的向着她的面上直噴了過去。她可怒了，鼻子一撅，大聲喃喃不絶。意想是敬告她不要隨地吐痰，要吐盡可向窗外吐去。不料她這末一喃喃，可逗引得那位女同胞（格格格格）笑個不止，旁邊的同胞們也都鬨的一聲笑了起來。直把那位外國太太氣得伸長頸子，連吞唾涎不止。我默默無語的向衆人看了一眼。我欲笑，但我不忍笑。　　是的啊！好一位多管閒事的外國老太婆，咱們中國人自顧自，向來是不管這些閒事的啊！</p>

<p>（江南好，江南春色好，盈盈柳綫青青草，桃花開滿龍華道，試看那春江帆影，樹梢的閒雲，更有陣陣春風，靄靄迎人笑····）　　一陣陣嬌脆的歌音，在抑揚的鋼琴聲裏，從一間富麗的小洋房的窗檻縫隙裏傳播出來，很驕誇地像禮拜堂的亂鐘向我們半生不死的遭難者告道，（你看，春神來了，）呵，不錯，果然的不錯，這是善於享受大自然的中國驕子呢，　　×××××　　（滾你媽的，跑開，）一者　，做做好事，給一個銅踐吧，）　　（不行，不行，媽你的臭····）　　（··············）　　（今早去看科學怪人，老九，儂去嗎？）　　（弗去）　　（那末去吃大菜好嗎？）　　（也弗去）　　（對了，對了，老九，跳舞塲裏廂去吧）　　（呵，曉得哉，去，老九，一道去，買隻手錶也唔啥道理，）</p>

<p>不久以前這裏還是砲聲震天，現在却是敲碎石塊的聲音無韻律的繼續，　　太陽晒着這瓦鑠場的每一個縫隙，一股濃烈的發酵了的黴味直騰上來，她們敲石婦便在這痗了的空氣中呼吸着，使盡她們最後的一縷氣力，　　她們都不住的將大石塊搥成無數的小石塊，每一個人面前都堆着這末大的一堆，　　搥搥搥！用盡了她們的意識和氣力，搥搥搥，不停的搥，打得火花四迸，這硬的鐵鎚打擊着硬的石塊，發出骷骨相棒擊的那樣清脆的響聲，　　一個工程師展開着他的圖樣從外面走來，後面的是一個大肚皮，高低不平的宛如跛脚似的走着，嘴裏啣着頂好的雪茄，工程師指着地圖説明他的建築計劃，大肚皮嘴裏所發出的只是嗡！嗡！嗡！）　　可是這裏畢竟是過於吵閙，除了這鐵錘碰着石子的聲音以外，前面是工人們打樁的吭唷吭唷，後面是運輸鋼骨的汽車的怒吼，還有那角落裏一個小孩在扯着敲石婦的母親的衣襟哭泣，於是這大肚皮不自禁的跑過去指小孩的母親　喝着，　　（你這個老太婆，你來做工，爲什麽帶一個小孩兒來啼啼哭哭的？吵得大家都不安，）　　（老爺｜因爲他餓了····眞是對不起哩，）老太婆一面在小孩兒臉上摑了一個耳光，一面哭泣着似的訴説，幸虧工程師來請他到另一個建築地去了，否則這老太婆定被趕了出去，然而小孩兒哭得更加厲害了，母親不由的滾下兩行熱涙，　　太陽仍是發狂般的晒着，鎚聲仍是繼續，　　戰後的和平所賜與她們的是什麽呢？只是如此而已，</p>

<h3 id="e1">Speaking of Sino-Soviet Diplomatic Resumption from the Perspective of the International Situation <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's commentary had already clarified that the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union is distinct from agreeing with Communism. Today, we will further expound on the necessity of Sino-Soviet diplomatic resumption from the perspective of the international situation. Since the end of the European War, the center of international politics has shifted to the Pacific region. And China's position as the center of the Pacific problem has been universally recognized. Currently, capitalism has entered a fundamental crisis. In the capitalist world, virtually every country is suffering from unprecedented mass unemployment, unprecedented overproduction, financial chaos and bankruptcy, and drastic reductions in domestic and foreign trade. Every country is experiencing a major economic panic. Accompanying this major panic is the intensification of preparations to re-divide the market. And the infighting among capitalist countries, inevitably caused by preparations to re-divide the market, is also intensifying daily. Under these circumstances, the situation in the Pacific is becoming increasingly tense. In other words, the China problem is becoming increasingly serious. From the September 18th Incident last year, to the January 28th Incident this year, to the current overt and covert struggles in the international arena, the understanding between France and Japan, the alliance between Britain and the United States, and the conflict between the United States and Japan, are all induced by the China problem. In essence, they are all preparatory battles for the division of China. And Japan's resolute military action to forcibly occupy the Northeast and invade Shanghai is even more clearly intended to dominate the Far East and actively prepare for a war between capitalist countries and a war between capitalism and socialism.</p>
<p>May I ask, where are China's allies in diplomacy today? Is it not in a completely isolated position? Under such a severe situation, will it sit idly by and await the slaughter of powerful neighbors? Or should it quickly establish a new diplomatic policy to prepare for the major disasters of tomorrow? Today, China's immediate oppression comes from Japan. The new diplomatic policy should naturally be based on uniting with nations that treat us equally and preserving the integrity of our territorial and administrative sovereignty. Since France already has an understanding with Japan, and Britain and Italy are unable to look eastward, the conflict between the United States and Japan, although increasingly intense, makes the US potentially our ally, but there is also the concern that its reach may not extend far enough. Only the Soviet Union is a crucial player in the Pacific problem that deserves attention. Since its revolution, it has voluntarily announced the abandonment of all unequal treaties concluded with us during the Tsarist era, and is geographically our natural ally. There is no doubt about this. Our resumption of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union can have the effect of mutual support in the diplomatic situation. The fact that Germany and Turkey were able to break through their difficult diplomatic situations by engaging with the Soviet Union is an example. If two great powers with vast territories, abundant resources, and large populations were to resume diplomatic relations, the situation in the Pacific would change greatly. Therefore, if China today is unwilling to sit idly by and await slaughter, then this must be the basis of its new diplomatic policy.</p>
<p>Even taking a step back, since the success of the Soviet revolution, the great powers initially implemented military intervention and then expected it to return to the old path of capitalism. Now, with the vigorous implementation of its Five-Year Plan, the national strength is thriving day by day. Although they are extremely jealous of it, they cannot help but develop close relations with it diplomatically or economically. The Soviet Union has also shifted from an aggressive foreign policy to a defensive one, signing non-aggression treaties with countries such as Turkey, Germany, Afghanistan, Latvia, Persia, Lithuania, Finland, and France. The United States is now also voicing support for resuming diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. Since the attitude of various countries in the world towards the Soviet Union is like this, what special reasons does China have for still closing its doors and not engaging in communication? Moreover, given the current international situation, where relationships are so intertwined and inseparable, failing to seek appropriate responses through a new diplomatic policy, and simply closing the door to others, is truly a most foolish diplomatic policy. Since the September 18th Incident last year, Japan has waged an undeclared war against us. The government authorities are still striving to maintain a line of diplomatic relations between the two countries. In that case, what further hesitation can there be regarding the resumption of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union?</p>

<p>The Takeover Committee Held its Second Meeting Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>The Joint Committee Held Another Consultation in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Yesterday Morning, Personnel Were Dispatched to Inspect the Takeover Sites in Advance The Takeover Committee's second meeting was held at the United Society at 1 PM yesterday. The five committee members, Yin Rugeng, Wen Yingxing, Guo Dehua, Zhu Xibai, and Han Deqin, attended, as well as representatives from all agencies related to the takeover of the war zone. The meeting adjourned at 2 PM. At 3 PM, Joint Committee members Yu Hongjun and Wen Yingxing arranged to meet with Japanese representatives at the U.S. Consulate to determine the dates and procedures for the withdrawal and takeover of various areas. The meeting concluded at 4 PM. The details obtained are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲Participants in the Joint Meeting Concerning the Takeover and Withdrawal Areas A joint meeting related to the takeover and withdrawal areas was held at the United Society of the Municipal Government at 12:30 PM yesterday. In addition to the five members of the Demilitarized Zone Takeover Committee, Yin Rugeng, Wen Yingxing, Guo Dehua, Zhu Xibai, and Han Deqin, relevant authorities attended, including Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Chinese members of the Joint Committee Yu Hongjun, Director of the Municipal Bureau of Public Works Shen Yi, Director of the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities Huang Boqiao, Director of the Municipal Bureau of Health Hu Hongji, Chief of the Second Section of the Public Security Bureau, Inspector General, Commander of the Police Brigade, and Director of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration Chen Xinghan, and Director of the Arsenal Song Shi*. Mayor Wu Tiecheng presided over the meeting.</p>
<p>▲Proceedings of the Meeting After the meeting was convened, it was reported that a notification had been received from Kenningham, chairman of the Joint Committee, stating that Japanese troops in the Zhabei area could begin to withdraw on the 16th. Given the simple wording of the notification, it was decided that Joint Committee members Yu Hongjun and Wen Yingxing would arrange to meet with Japanese committee members at the U.S. Consulate to discuss in detail the date and procedures for the withdrawal of Japanese troops from the Zhabei area, and to decide on preparations for various handover matters. The decisions included: (1) Joint Committee members Yu Hongjun and Wen Yingxing were responsible for negotiating the dates and procedures for the withdrawal of Japanese troops and our takeover of various areas in the future with the Japanese side; (2) The Public Security Bureau was responsible for planning and preparing for local security during the takeover, and it was decided that the original district heads of the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 3rd districts would continue to be responsible; (3) The Bureau of Public Utilities was responsible for all public utility matters such as water and electricity; (4) The Bureau of Health was responsible for health-related matters such as cleaning streets, dredging ditches, and disinfection; (5) The Bureau of Education was responsible for the reorganization of schools, and Supervisor Ma Chonggan and Inspector Zhong Shijie were sent in advance to assist with matters related to the schools in the takeover area; (6) The Bureau of Public Works was responsible for repairing roads and reorganizing houses.</p>
<p>▲Sino-Japanese Consultation on Withdrawal Dates After the second meeting, Joint Committee members Yu Hongjun and Wen Yingxing arranged to meet with Japanese committee members at the U.S. Consulate on Jiujiang Road at 3 PM to discuss the withdrawal of Japanese troops and the procedures involved. At 3 PM, our committee members were ready to attend, and Japanese committee members Okazaki, Harada, and staff officer Ito of the Marine Corps also arrived. The consultation lasted until 4 PM. It was reported that the results of yesterday's consultation included: (1) The Japanese side agreed to withdraw Japanese troops from the railway area in Zhabei on the 16th of this month and declared that all Japanese troops stationed in Shanghai would be withdrawn from Shanghai within one month; (2) Our side would send personnel to inspect Zhabei on the 14th of this month and arrange for takeover matters; (3) The Japanese side also agreed to completely return all railway property of the two railway administrations upon our official receipt of the takeover notice; (4) Regarding the vehicles left behind by the Shanghai-Taicang Long-Distance Bus Company, it was said that many had been destroyed when the Japanese troops arrived, and few remained. Further investigation will be conducted; (5) The occupied schools will be taken over by the respective principals.</p>
<p>▲Personnel Sent to Inspect in Advance The Takeover Committee, as the second phase of takeover was about to begin, dispatched Duan Tixin, Tao Xiaojie, Guo Zhenliang, and Zeng Keguang to inspect Jiangwan, Wusong, Baoshan, Yuepu, etc. at 10:30 AM yesterday, and Li Shengjun, Zha Nanqiang, Guo Chenggai, and Li Qingxin to inspect Zhenru, Dachang, Liuhang, Luodian, etc. They also contacted County Magistrate Sun Xiwen to discuss the allocation of police affairs.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Amidst the Sound of Taking Over Zhabei <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>▲Various Municipal Government Bureaus Actively Preparing</p>
<p>Since the signing of the ceasefire and troop withdrawal agreement, Japanese troops have gradually withdrawn as agreed, and our side is proceeding with the takeover. Special police from Beiping have arrived in the capital, and the takeover of Zhabei and other areas is imminent. The municipal government has been actively preparing in recent days. Various bureaus, such as the Public Security Bureau for the takeover of police power and the Health Bureau for sanitation, are also busy. The preparations and various situations of the municipal bureaus of Social Affairs, Public Utilities, Public Works, Finance, Land, etc., are recorded below:</p>
<p>Since the January 28th Incident, the Social Affairs Bureau's projects and facilities in the Zhabei area, such as civilian residences and poverty relief loan offices, had to be temporarily suspended. Now that the takeover is imminent, relief measures are being carefully planned. In addition to restoring the original projects, efforts are being made for temporary relief. The details of each item are listed separately below:</p>
<p>▲Civilian Residences Since 1929, the city has built one civilian residence each year, renting them at low prices. To date, there are three such residences, totaling more than 800 rooms. The first and third residences are both in Zhabei and were largely destroyed by artillery fire. The third residence was only established in August last year and had the most housing units. According to reports from the general manager and inspectors, the losses were quite heavy, which is regrettable. However, the bureau believes that the problem of civilian housing after the war is even more serious than before the war. Although the municipal treasury is extremely stretched, for the sake of the general public, repairs should be actively carried out, and additional construction should be planned. Once the takeover is completed, the first and third residences will be immediately restored, and the original residents will be given priority to move in. If there are vacant rooms after the deadline, others will be considered.</p>
<p>▲Poverty Relief Loans Since its establishment in 1929, the city's poverty relief loan office has expanded to fifteen branches, distributed throughout the city. The total amount of loans issued in 1931 reached more than 130,000 yuan. Before the incident, loans issued in Zhabei, Wusong, Jiangwan, Zhenru, Yinhang, Pengpu, etc., amounted to 15,000 yuan. The borrowers have suffered greatly from this calamity, and it is unbearable to strictly demand repayment. However, the loan fund is related to the expansion of the project, and it is difficult to reduce it. The bureau is currently planning to reorganize the method, striving to recover the loans within a possible range. In addition, due to the economic difficulties of the poor after the takeover, funds are being raised to restore the loan office to benefit the poor.</p>
<p>▲Temporary Relief There will certainly be many residents of the war zone who are displaced. The bureau is consulting with various charitable organizations to organize temporary relief. In addition: (1) Letters have been sent to Tongren Fuyuan Hall and Pushan Villa, etc., to find ways to rebury the remains in the war zone; (2) The Shanghai Charity Association has been ordered to restore the second vagrant rehabilitation center; (3) Personnel have been dispatched to consult with Mr. Wang Yiting to restore the China Women and Children Relief Association and the Jiangwan Women and Children Shelter; (4) The fourth section of the bureau has sent a letter to Wang Binyan, director of the Zhabei Charity Association, to restore the association's Huier Children's Home as soon as possible, and to discuss temporary relief measures for the poor in Zhabei.</p>
<p>▲Post-War Grain The rice market in northern Shanghai has been almost completely closed since the Suzhou Creek was blocked after the outbreak of the war. Although some merchants have moved to the concession or Nanshi, their numbers are small. The bureau is now urging the rice shops originally in Zhabei to resume business immediately after the takeover to facilitate the people's food supply. As for the rice shops, if they cannot be generally established for a while, it is planned to set up public rice sales offices in places where there is a greater need, selling rice at low prices, so that the general public will not be affected by the grain situation.</p>
<p>The municipal Finance Bureau is actively preparing to restore its operations and facilities in the war zone, such as the Tax Collection Office and the Ship Tax Office. Details of each item are listed below:</p>
<p>▲All Branch Offices Destroyed The Municipal North Tax Collection Office, located on Minli Road, the Wusong Ship Tax Office, located on Waima Road, the Yinxiang District Tax Collection Office, located on Linping Road, and the Zhabei Ship Tax Office, located on Guangfu Road, were completely shut down after the incident. Important official documents were risked and moved out during the ceasefire. After the ceasefire, personnel were sent to investigate and learned that the Wusong Ship Tax Office had been destroyed and its equipment stolen. Although the buildings of the other offices were not destroyed, all the equipment had been stolen.</p>
<p>▲Preparation Plans Bureau Director Cai Zengji decided that after the Public Security Bureau restores police power, the first step will be to restore the Yinxiang and Municipal North Tax Collection Offices and send investigators to conduct a survey of taxpayers while the Public Security Bureau is conducting a census, so as to proceed with the collection of taxes. The second step will be to restore the Wusong and Zhabei Ship Tax Offices. As for the stamp tax books, etc., that were stolen during the war, they have been declared invalid.</p>
<p>▲Treasury Situation The Finance Bureau is currently investigating and compiling statistics on the financial losses caused by the war, in order to provide a reference for future negotiations. Before the January 28th Incident, monthly revenue was approximately 500,000 to 600,000 yuan, with house tax being the largest, followed by vehicle tax, business tax, and miscellaneous taxes. During the war, monthly revenue sharply decreased to 70,000 to 80,000 yuan. Now, after the ceasefire, revenue is gradually increasing, and monthly revenue can reach more than 100,000 yuan. After police power is restored in the war zone, house tax, vehicle tax, etc., can further increase revenue. However, wharf duties have always been collected by the customs and directly handed over to the municipal treasury by the municipal government.</p>
<p>The Municipal Land Bureau is actively working to restore its operations and facilities in the war zone, such as surveying grain counters. Details of each item are listed below:</p>
<p>▲Temporary Suspension of Transfer The municipal government issued an order to the Land Bureau yesterday, stating: "In order to comply with the order, it is hereby ordered that the districts of Wusong, Jiangwan, Yinxiang, Yinhang, Pengpu, Zhabei, Zhenru, etc., of this city, since this war, most of the local buildings have been destroyed by artillery fire, and prosperous areas have been reduced to scorched earth. The original boundaries have mostly lost their original shape. Even the various contracts and documents owned by various businesses have been reduced to ashes or lost due to the urgency of the incident. At this time of preparing for reconstruction, organizing boundaries and protecting property rights are of utmost importance. Under these special circumstances, if theft and illegal sales occur again, it will not only be difficult to investigate, but also easily lead to disputes. In addition to the reorganization of roads, which has been ordered to be handled by the Bureau of Public Works in conjunction with this bureau, this bureau is hereby ordered to immediately comply with the order. All land contracts, sales, and transfers within the above-mentioned war-stricken areas should be temporarily suspended. At the same time, this bureau should actively plan fundamental clearing measures, and all reports from various households should be surveyed and registered in advance to prevent disputes. You are hereby ordered to comply and report on the compliance situation by a set deadline." This order was issued.</p>
<p>▲Winter Grain Tax Extension The collection period for this year's winter grain tax in this city expired on February 15th. At that time, the war was raging, and few villagers were able to pay the tax due to traffic obstructions. Therefore, the bureau extended the deadline to May 15th. As for the grain tax in Zhenru, Wusong, Jiangwan, Zhabei, Yinxiang, etc., due to being within the war zone, whether to grant a slight reduction or extension will depend on the municipal government's orders and regulations.</p>
<p>▲Surveying Work Surveying work was forced to be temporarily suspended after the outbreak of the war. It has been decided that after police power is restored, Section Chief Fan Yongzeng of the third section will be responsible for restoring surveying work. As for land disputes and land certificates in the war zone, the fourth section will be responsible for restoring them. The second section will be responsible for restoring the exchange and registration of title deeds.</p>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Public Works is actively preparing for operations and facilities in the war zone, such as cleaning roads, filling in trenches, and demolishing fortifications. Details of each item are listed below:</p>
<p>▲Restoring Management The Zhabei District Road Engineering Management Office established by the bureau on Minli Road and the Yinxiang District Road Engineering Management Office on Yucai Road were not destroyed by bombing, but all tools, except for public transportation, were stolen. It has been decided to prepare for restoration after the Public Security Bureau restores police power, and it is planned to order Zhabei District Director Zhang Danru and Yinxiang Director Xu Baohang and Li, leading the staff, to proceed with the takeover.</p>
<p>▲Planned Steps The bureau's plan for taking over the war zone is as follows: The first step is to clean the roads, fill in trenches related to traffic, demolish fortifications, restore bridges, survey routes, and demolish dangerous buildings to restore traffic. The second step is to reorganize various roads, repair damaged ones, dredge ditches, and repair houses to ensure that residents live in peace. The third step is to handle all post-war public works issues, such as construction, to achieve reconstruction. The fourth step is to carry out the construction of the city center to realize the Greater Shanghai Plan.</p>
<p>▲Designated Responsibility The damage in the Zhabei area is most severe northwest of the railway, west of Tongli Road, east of Song Park Road, and south of Liuying Road. Nine-tenths of the houses have been destroyed. Eight-tenths of the towns of Wusong and Jiangwan have been completely destroyed by bombing. Personnel have been dispatched to investigate, and Section Chief Xu Guansan of the third section is responsible for handling bridge damage, Section Chief Xue Cixin of the third section is responsible for reorganizing roads and ditches, and Section Chief Mo Heng of the fourth section is responsible for construction to achieve restoration.</p>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities' operations and facilities in the war zone, such as public utilities such as water, electricity, and buses, as well as its branch offices, had to be temporarily suspended due to the war. It is now actively seeking ways to restore them. Details of each item are listed below:</p>
<p>▲Destruction Situation The Shanghai North Advertisement Management Office established by the bureau, located in Zhongxingli, Baoshan Road, the Wusong Vehicle Affairs Office, located on Wusong Waima Road, the Wusong Street Lamp Management Office, located on Wusong Waima Road, and the Jiangwan Street Lamp Management Office, located in Jiangwan Town, were all completely destroyed by Japanese troops. Fortunately, all important official documents had been moved out earlier. All staff members have been transferred to other departments or temporarily suspended with pay. It has now been decided to gradually restore them depending on the level of funding and need. As for the only important task at present, it is to restore water and electricity, because only after water and electricity are restored can the city's economy be revitalized.</p>
<p>▲Water and Electricity Restoration The losses to water and electricity in the war zone are quite large. The Zhabei Chinese Water and Electricity Company believes that restoring water and electricity is a matter that cannot be delayed. Once police power is restored, engineers will be dispatched to inspect various places, repair damaged pipes and wires, restore street lamps, and supply water and electricity as usual. At the same time, efforts will be made to raise funds to actively carry out restoration. However, the losses caused by the war are quite large, such as the electricity meters, water meters, wires, pipes, sheds, and electrical wood of the users, all of which have been burned. It will certainly not be possible to fully restore them in a short period of time.</p>
<p>▲Restoring Transportation Bureau Director Huang Boqiao is paying close attention to transportation matters in the war zone. He has specially scheduled a meeting for 10 AM today at the bureau's office on Fenglin Bridge Municipal Government Road to convene the general managers of the Huashang Public Bus Company and the Shanghai-Taicang Long-Distance Bus Company to discuss actively preparing for the restoration of transportation.</p>

<p>Text of the Ceasefire Agreement Copy</p>
<h3 id="e4">Continued Discussion Yesterday <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>▲No Issues Remain in the Chinese Version</p>
<p>▲Two Points Remain Unresolved in the Japanese Version</p>
<p>▲Hopes for Signing Next Monday After the signing of the Sino-Japanese ceasefire agreement, the signing of its copy was repeatedly delayed and has not been fully resolved because both parties believed that there were inappropriate words in the wording and mutually requested revisions. Initially, the Japanese side requested revisions to more than ten phrases in the Chinese version. The less significant issues, such as the Japanese side requesting that (monitoring) translated by our side be changed to (guarding), (witness) be changed to (mediator), and the addition of the word (after), totaling more than ten phrases, were all rejected because the requested changes did not conform to Chinese grammar. The more serious issues were the previously approved three places: (combat behavior), (withdrawal), and (location). The four words (combat behavior) were heavily disputed at the time. Our representatives, Secretary Deng Zhongying and Yin Rugeng, discussed with the Japanese side for about six hours. It was not resolved. Finally, after repeated consultations, it was decided to change it to the four words (hostile behavior). The Japanese side said that the Japanese army was not retreating, so they requested that the two words (withdrawal) be changed to (removal). However, our side believed that there was no such phrase in Chinese, and the agreement could not contain a phrase that did not conform to Chinese grammar or syntax. Therefore, as a result, the phrase was not changed and was still included in the agreement as before. The Japanese side originally requested that the two words (location) be changed to (area). However, our side believed that the word area had a slightly broader scope and was not the intention of the original text. After consultation, it was changed to the two words (place). As a result, the Chinese copy was completely resolved. There were five points in the Japanese copy that our side considered inappropriate, as described in yesterday's newspaper. The less significant issues, such as (co-attendee) should be changed to (attending person), (guarding) should be changed to (monitoring), etc., have all been resolved. The remaining three items are still important phrases, such as the Japanese translation of (take extreme measures), which involves both China and Japan, so our side requested that it be changed to (measures). The two words (nearby) are far from the original meaning of adjacent, so our side requested that it be changed to (adjacent). (When dividing into four questions) means (appropriate time), so our side requested that it be changed to (temporarily). Yesterday, Japanese Secretary Okazaki, accompanied by translator Aruno, visited Zhang Sixu, director of our information department, at about 12:00 noon to continue discussing this issue. They talked for about forty minutes and left at about 1:00 PM. As a result, the Japanese side has not yet fully agreed to modify the remaining three points. Our representative, Zhang Sixu, visited Foreign Vice Minister Guo Taiqi for instructions after talking with the Japanese representatives. As a result, it was heard that the two words (take extreme measures) may not be changed. However, because it has not been completely determined, the remaining two points, namely (nearby) changed to (adjacent) and (when dividing into four questions) changed to (temporarily), are of great importance. Our side insists that they must be done. It is estimated that both parties will have to consult with their superiors once or twice before a signing date can be decided. The signing may be held as early as next Monday, according to authorities.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Explaining Doubts About the Agreement <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Guo Taiqi Said There Were No Unpublished Annexes</p>
<p>Wu Tiecheng Replied to Zhang Xueliang's Inquiry国民新闻社 (National News Agency) reported that, according to a special statement issued by Vice Minister Guo Taiqi, he was deeply shocked by the recent reports in Shanghai newspapers, etc., that in addition to the announced ceasefire agreement, there were so-called unpublished annexes and secret meeting minutes, etc. During the meeting, each party kept its own records (in addition to the British side, which had a secretary present to take notes, the American, French, and Italian ambassadors all kept their own records). Our side's records were reported to the ministry by airmail the next day after each meeting. The ministry has records that can be checked to verify the truth. As for the annexes to the agreement, there were originally four. Later, the drafting committee merged the second and third annexes into one at the last meeting because they were of the same nature, which is the current second annex. The original fourth annex was changed to the third annex. Therefore, there are only three annexes to the agreement, and there is no so-called unpublished fourth annex. This is a special statement.</p>
<p>Due to the signing of the ceasefire agreement, there were many misunderstandings among outsiders. Zhang Xueliang in Beiping also inquired about the truth by telegram yesterday. Wu Tiecheng replied by telegram. The original text is copied below: "Director Zhang Suijing of Beiping, Brother Hanqing Jian, the Sino-Japanese ceasefire agreement in Shanghai was signed at the British Consulate in Shanghai at noon this morning, with the participation and mediation of the ambassadors of Britain, the United States, France, and Italy, based on the spirit of the League of Nations resolution. In addition to the ambassadors of Britain, the United States, France, and Italy, our side was signed by representatives Guo Taiqi, Dai Ji, and Huang Qiang, and the Japanese side was signed by Shigemitsu, Ueda, and Tashiro. The Japanese side declared on the spot that the Japanese army could begin to withdraw after the agreement was signed. The Japanese army on the front lines of Jiading and Baoshan, etc., withdrew in accordance with the agreement, and the first step of our takeover is about to be completed. It is completely untrue that our side has agreed not to station troops south of the Suzhou Creek and in Pudong. According to the agreement, the Japanese army must withdraw to the position before January 28, that is, to the extraterritorial road construction line of the concession. Their initial withdrawal to the vicinity of Shanghai is still temporary. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will photograph and publish the Chinese and English agreements in newspapers, so that all doubts can be dispelled. Thank you for your attention. Wu Tiecheng kowtows, rebutting the opinions of the political and press circles in Beijing."</p>
<h3 id="e6">Comments from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>▲No 20-Kilometer Limit in the Agreement Reuters reported from Nanjing on the 12th that an official from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said yesterday that he hoped that the Chinese government would not allow Chinese police to cross into the 20-kilometer area after the Japanese army withdrew. This statement has aroused serious rebuttals from political and press circles here. They say that the ceasefire agreement does not say that it prohibits Chinese troops from entering the 20-kilometer area. Moreover, the Chinese representative stated in front of all the representatives on the day the agreement was signed that the agreement attached no restrictions on the movement of Chinese troops within their territory. The Japanese representative also acknowledged this statement at the time without any objection. Therefore, it is surprising that an official from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs made such a statement yesterday. The Japanese Privy Council</p>
<h3 id="e7">Dissatisfaction with the Ceasefire Agreement <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>▲Signed by England, America, Germany, and Italy ▲Its content is similar to an international agreement. The Osaka Asahi Shimbun reports that the interpretations of the Sino-Japanese ceasefire agreement by the Privy Council and the government differ. The Privy Council believes that, from a formal perspective, the agreement is not merely an agreement between the military authorities of China and Japan. In addition to diplomats from both countries, the ambassadors of England, America, France, and Italy also signed it. Furthermore, in terms of content, it holds significant implications. The relationship established by the agreement extends beyond the scope of a ceasefire agreement and resembles an international agreement. Therefore, it is argued that the substantive content of this agreement should be subject to the Emperor's approval and requires explanation from the government. The government, however, believes that it is simply a military agreement between the Chinese and Japanese armies and does not need to be submitted to the Emperor.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Japanese Troops Gradually Leaving Shanghai <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>▲The 14th Division is heading to the Northeast ▲The 9th Division will completely withdraw in two weeks. The Japanese garrison in Shanghai has been ordered to withdraw. The 14th Division is heading to the Northeast with the intention of using force to coerce our Eastern Provinces. The 9th Division is being transferred back to Kanazawa, Japan, and is already in the process of departure. The situation is detailed as follows: ▲The 14th Division departs. The 14th Division of the army, commanded by Lieutenant General Matsumoto, has received instructions from the Japanese government to proceed to the Northeast. In recent days, units of the division have retreated from Luodian, Taicang, Nanshiang, and other places to Shanghai and concentrated in Woosung. The first to depart were the infantry. The Japanese Ministry of the Army has assigned transport ships, such as the Rokkosan Maru, to load the entire infantry of the division on the afternoon of the 11th and transport them directly to Dalian Bay for landing, and then transfer them by train to various locations in Shenyang. Specialized troops are also being loaded. ▲The 9th Division is about to withdraw. The 9th Division, commanded by Ueda, which was the most active in the Shanghai battle, is stationed in Woosung, Kiangwan, and other places. It has also received instructions from the Japanese government to withdraw completely from Shanghai by the end of May. The division headquarters has forwarded these instructions to the various units, ordering them to prepare their baggage. The withdrawal from Shanghai is scheduled to begin on the 20th of this month and is expected to be completed in about seven days. ▲Return date for officers. The injuries of General Shirakawa Yoshinori, commander of the Shanghai Expeditionary Force, and Lieutenant General Ueda, commander of the 9th Division, are gradually improving. Shirakawa is expected to recover in about four weeks, and Ueda in about six weeks. It is reported that the headquarters of the Shanghai Expeditionary Force has completed its winding down, and Shirakawa, Ueda, Nomura, and others are scheduled to leave Shanghai on the naval flagship Izumo on the 20th of this month to return to Japan. ▲Naval Landing Force to take charge of Shanghai's defense. After the withdrawal of the Japanese army, the protection of Japanese residents in the Shanghai area will be the responsibility of the Naval Landing Force. There are currently 1,200 Japanese naval landing forces in Shanghai, and there is also a large battalion in Hankow. ▲Construction of army barracks is halted. The Ta Mei Wan Bao reports that the order to withdraw troops from Tokyo was unexpected by both the Japanese army and Japanese residents in this area. However, the intention of the Japanese Ministry of the Army had been hinted at earlier. The ministry sent a cable to the Japanese army in this area, instructing them to stop the construction of barracks in the 63 Huayuan Garden. All construction projects of the Japanese army have been halted today (12th).</p>
<h3 id="e9">Japanese Residents Oppose Troop Withdrawal <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>▲They even advocate establishing a free city with military protection. ▲Yesterday's emergency meeting followed by a petition to Shirakawa. After the news that the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tokyo had ordered the invading Japanese army in Shanghai to completely withdraw and return to Japan within a month reached Shanghai, all Japanese residents in Shanghai expressed their opposition. In addition to sending representatives to meet with Commander Shirakawa to request a postponement of the withdrawal of troops stationed in Shanghai, they immediately notified all Japanese residents to convene an emergency committee meeting at the Japanese Club at 69 Wenjian Shi Road at 2:00 PM yesterday to discuss countermeasures. Twelve committee members attended, and approximately twenty observers were present. The meeting lasted from 2:00 PM until after 5:00 PM. After various inquiries by reporters, the results of the meeting are as follows: (1) Send a telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the name of all Japanese residents in Shanghai, requesting the withdrawal of the order to withdraw troops within a specified period. (2) Establish a free city with military protection. (3) Send a telegram to the government authorities, urging them to promptly negotiate with the Chinese government to prohibit all anti-Japanese movements and boycotts of Japanese goods. (4) Send representatives to meet with Shirakawa, requesting that the Japanese troops withdrawn from the front lines not be boarded for return to Japan until the free city is officially established. Japanese Minister of the Army.</p>
<h3 id="e10">Araki's Outrageous Remarks <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>▲Even though the Japanese army is withdrawing, it can still return. ▲His words contain a threatening undertone. Dentsu, Tokyo, 12th: The Japanese government has announced to China and abroad that the Japanese army will begin withdrawing from the 20th of this month and will complete the withdrawal by the end of the month. Therefore, Minister of the Army Araki told a Dentsu reporter that some within the government feel deeply uneasy about withdrawing all Japanese troops and returning them to the mainland. However, with the eyes of other countries upon them and after signing the ceasefire agreement, leaving a special naval landing force to continue guarding the area should alleviate concerns. Furthermore, army units are on standby in the mainland, prepared to be dispatched again in the event of unrest. Therefore, there is no need to worry about withdrawing all troops. Next is the issue of the round table conference. I believe this troop withdrawal can promote it. The problem must be that the establishment of a neutral zone, the realization of a clear international city of Shanghai, and the elimination of anti-Japanese insults and other matters will lead to a strong partnership between China and Japan. I earnestly hope for the realization of the above items. However, if the Chinese side does not change its anti-Japanese attitude, there is a risk of a second or third Shanghai incident occurring in various parts of China. This is commonly acknowledged by foreign civil and military officials in China. I deeply feel this danger and hope that anti-Japanese insults will quickly cease, etc. The Jinghu Railway</p>
<h3 id="e11">Preparing for Full Line Operation <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>▲A test train ran yesterday afternoon on the Qingyang Port. The Qingyang Port bridge on the Jinghu Railway has been completely repaired. The Railway Administration dispatched a rescue train at 12:30 yesterday to test the line, running as far as Nanshiang Station. The railway staff originally stationed at various stations between Kunshan and Nanshiang boarded this train to return to their respective stations to prepare for the full line operation. Although the tracks east of Nanshiang were not severely damaged, they still require minor repairs. Once the line is open, passenger and freight transport can be restored. The railway authorities had already received orders to accept requests from various carriers to transport goods and are now making thorough preparations. However, the freight depot at the North Station was destroyed by Japanese aircraft, which presents some difficulties for freight transport. Suzhou, 12th: A test train ran across the Qingyang Port bridge on the morning of the 12th, and an engineering train will proceed eastward across the bridge to repair the Luchiachiang bridge. It is expected to reach Nanshiang on the evening of the 12th or the morning of the 13th. If the Japanese troops withdraw completely, the engineering train can repair and test the line along the way to Zhabei before the 15th. Passenger trains can resume operations around the 20th. The headquarters of the 19th Route Army moved from Zhengyi to the Suicheng Garden in Suzhou on the afternoon of the 12th. ▲Station staff gather in Suzhou. The Car Affairs Office of the Jinghu Railway Administration is now awaiting the resumption of train services. Employees of various stations in the war zone who previously escaped to Shanghai have been instructed to return to their original stations to begin reorganizing station affairs. The stationmasters, staff, and laborers of Zhenru, Nanshiang, Huangdu, Anting, Tianfu'an, and Luchiachiang stations who remained in Shanghai were ordered by the head of the Car Affairs Office the day before yesterday to take a steamer to Suzhou Station to gather and await orders for departure to their respective stations. It is reported that the employees of the various stations in the war zone were led by Li Songbai, the night shift Car Affairs Section Chief of the Suzhou-Shanghai section, yesterday afternoon and departed from Suzhou Station on a special rescue train. The employees were accompanied by supplies for the various stations and were safely delivered to their original stations in the war zone to carry out reorganizations before the resumption of train services, in order to avoid any temporary disruptions. ▲Personnel dispatched to repair the Shanghai-Nanshiang section. The railway authorities believe that the Japanese army has now withdrawn to Zhenru and will soon withdraw from Shanghai Station. Yesterday, Feng Qili, the chief engineer of the Shanghai section, was specially assigned to be responsible for repairing the Shanghai-Nanshiang section. After receiving the order, Feng has prepared the necessary repair materials and will immediately proceed to start work as soon as the Japanese troops withdraw. ▲Train cars temporarily used as ticket offices. The station buildings of various stations on the Jinghu Railway were destroyed, and it is impossible to rebuild them in a short period of time. However, ticket sales and other offices are essential after the resumption of train services. Therefore, the offices and ticket offices of the destroyed stations will temporarily be housed in train cars.</p>

<p>Japanese troops dig trenches and advance towards Yuguan in large numbers. Unreasonable demands raised by the Japanese side were sternly rejected by He Zhuguo. The Central Government orders Zhang Xueliang to deal with the incident with force. (Peiping) Japanese troops south of the Yuguan railway, our troops north of it, both sides in confrontation (12th Special Dispatch) (Nanjing) According to today's Tianjin telegram, the Japanese vanguard is only eight miles from Shanhaiguan and continues to advance towards the Chinese defense line. Japanese troops are also digging trenches in the Hongqiangzi area, five miles from Yuguan. Furthermore, Japanese troops have dismantled railway tracks in the Changli area south of Yuguan. Armored trains from the south have reached Suizhong, only one station away from Yuguan (12th Reuters Telegram).</p>

<p>(Peiping) Due to repeated provocations by Japanese troops, He Zhuguo arranged to meet with Japanese military officers to discuss solutions. The meeting took place at the Fuxingju Restaurant at 5:00 PM on the 10th. Three representatives from our side, including He Zhuguo, attended, as well as three representatives from the Japanese garrison, including the head of the military police. The Japanese side insisted on the right to freely suppress bandits within eighty miles of Yuguan and demanded to borrow important passes such as Jioumenkou and Shimenzhai. He Zhuguo sternly rejected these demands, and the meeting ended without result (12th Special Dispatch).</p>

He Zhuguo sent a staff officer to question them, and the commander of the Japanese garrison claimed that there were bandits 15 miles west of Yuguan that they intended to suppress, but in reality, there were no bandits (12th Special Dispatch). (Peiping) On the afternoon of the 10th, a puppet flag was suddenly discovered outside the east wall of Yuguan Station. Over 100 Japanese soldiers, led by the commander of the garrison, and over 100 puppet police, led by the Chinese Guan Shanxian, conducted drills and fired guns near the station, causing great fear among the residents.

<p>(Peiping) Yuguan telegram: He Zhuguo told reporters that Yuguan has become increasingly important since the September 18th Incident. The commander of the Japanese garrison, Matsushita, recently used the excuse of preventing insurgents to demand the freedom to suppress them in writing, forcing him to sign and making threatening remarks. He has a responsibility to defend the territory, stopping unauthorized actions and protecting overseas Chinese. The troops defending Yuguan are all well-trained. Recently, over 80 puppet police arrived in the pass, claiming to maintain the puppet Fengshan Road, without prior notification, which is a transgression. He only knows of the nation. He is negotiating about the Japanese troops opening fire, which affects security, and hopes to resolve it (12th Special Dispatch).</p>

<p>(Peiping) The spokesperson of the Japanese Embassy told a Reuters reporter today that the rumor that there would be an incident in Yuguan is unfounded. The report in the Chinese newspaper that Japan has dispatched a division of troops to Yuguan is completely baseless. Japan has not increased the number of troops stationed there, which is currently less than two hundred, and has no intention of increasing them.

<p>Representatives from over forty countries participated in the funeral procession. The procession was two miles long, solemn and respectful. ▲Guomin News Agency, Paris, 12th: Today, the funeral of the deceased French President Doumer was held. The whole country suspended work to mourn. The hearse left the Presidential Palace at 8:07 in the morning. The procession was about two miles long. Representatives from over forty countries attended the funeral procession, including the King of Belgium, the Prince of Wales of the United Kingdom, the Duke of Aosta of Italy, and Prince Paul of Yugoslavia, all of whom were closely protected by guards. The coffin was placed on an open hearse, drawn by eight black horses, led by thousands of cavalry, and followed by lawyers in gowns, members of the French Academy, members of both houses of parliament, and representatives of the people. The new President Lebrun, accompanied by Doumer's family, closely followed the hearse. The Belgian King and the British Prince and other dignitaries and the diplomatic corps were behind the family. Troops stood guard along the road, and saluted with their guns when the hearse passed. Hundreds of thousands of people gathered behind the troops, all taking off their hats and sobbing. At 9:30, they arrived at Notre Dame Cathedral, where Cardinal Verdi conducted a Mass and prayed. After the prayer, they went to the Pantheon, where Prime Minister Tardieu delivered a eulogy. (The following is a Havas dispatch.) He highly praised the deceased president's personality and said that the murderer's actions aroused unanimous indignation. Afterwards, Doumer's life experience, from the beginning of his prominence to his appointment as head of state, was narrated one by one. Tardieu especially praised the deceased president's political achievements during his tenure as Governor-General of Vietnam. He said, (Although Mr. Doumer was old and had experienced grief, he still did not avoid difficulties and worked hard for the country, serving as Minister of Finance twice, then being appointed as Speaker of the Senate, and finally enjoying the glory of head of state.) In his conclusion, Mr. Tai also said, (The death of President Doumer is no less than the death of a warrior on the battlefield. There are still two responsibilities that he has left to us. Mr. Doumer was humble throughout his life, so we can only work hard to fulfill this mission in order to repay Mr. Doumer. The so-called two responsibilities are: one is to help his family with our sincere respect, and the other is to unite and work hard to enable France to fulfill its mission.) ▲Reuters, Paris, 12th: The road that the funeral procession of the deceased President Doumer will pass through was lined with people in the morning to express their grief and respect. His remains were first moved from the Presidential Palace to the Pantheon, where Tardieu delivered the funeral speech, and then stopped at Notre Dame Cathedral, where the Bishop of Paris performed the funeral rites. The procession was half a mile long, led by the Republican Guard cavalry and infantry and retired soldiers, followed by seven cars full of wreaths, one of which was red roses, which was a gift from the British Emperor, followed by a black silver hearse, drawn by six black horses, with four people on each side as escorts, followed by Doumer's family, all walking, followed by the new President Lebrun, the King of Belgium, the British Prince, other foreign representatives, members of the Tardieu Cabinet, members of the diplomatic corps, and members of both houses of parliament, all following the funeral procession. The whole team moved slowly and was unusually quiet. Only the sound of the army band playing mourning music and the sound of horses' hooves were heard along the way. After the ceremony at Notre Dame Cathedral, the team reassembled and slowly circled the Cluny Museum and reached the Pantheon, placing the coffin on the top of the wide steps. After a while, it will be moved to the Doumer family cemetery in Vaux-Villars. Two of Doumer's four sons who died in battle in the European War are also buried there. After arriving at the Pantheon, Tardieu, from the left of the burial niche, that is, the place where his cabinet colleagues stood, went to the right of the burial niche. The family members of the deceased president were all tearfully watching the coffin there. Mr. Tai then addressed Mrs. Doumer to comfort her. The scene at that time was very moving. Mr. Tai then ascended the platform and praised the deceased president's deeds during his lifetime for twenty minutes. At that time, the Paris garrison, led by General Chaulot, marched in a parade, and the military appearance was very impressive. It lasted for forty-five minutes. After the new president and the royal family members left the Pantheon, the coffin was placed on the hearse again and carried to the Vaux-Villars cemetery. The Doumer family and members of the cabinet were followed. The funeral was very simple. ▲Guomin News Agency, Paris, 11th: The British Prince of Wales, the King of Belgium, Prince Paul of Yugoslavia, Prince Xue Gewa of Sweden, and others arrived here tonight to attend the funeral of the deceased French President Doumer tomorrow. Many famous politicians and nobles from European countries also came here to attend the funeral.

His speech attracted much attention from various countries. The gist of it is translated as follows: Mr. Clark said that the US State Department's note to China and Japan on January 8 and the letter from Stimson to Senator Borah on February 13 were intended to materialize and promote their realization. In other words, the United States absolutely does not recognize new territories acquired in violation of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and this is the fundamental concept of diplomacy. Originally, the method of preventing war was the use of force to prevent war, which was included in the Covenant of the League of Nations, but the Pact of Paris made no mention of it at all. However, recently, the method of coercion against countries that do not abide by the Kellogg Pact is to advocate economic sanctions. This concept is also implied in the Covenant of the League of Nations, so the US government is extremely opposed to it for fear of inciting war. However, the United States takes this as a prerequisite and wants to realize the effect of the Hoover Doctrine, that is, President Hoover is concerned about improving future international relations, and completely regards any result obtained through war as invalid. This is a strict policy of using force, but this doctrine does not seem to correct the current injustices in the world. However, according to the meaning of the Kellogg Pact to prevent war, and without the danger of war arising from economic sanctions, it is a peaceful and effective sanction. Therefore, I firmly believe that the Hoover Doctrine will be welcomed by our people and is a fair foundation in international law. Mr. Clark also said that there is no relationship between official boycotts and individual voluntary boycotts. Recalling when the United States was in World War I, the majority of the people rejected German goods, but the US government could not order individual citizens to suppress their non-boycott and force them to buy German goods, etc. Mr. Clark was an important figure in the United States. Since Stimson has not yet returned to the country, he has become the head of the foreign affairs authority. Now that he has published this policy at an authoritative international law conference, its relationship with our country is very significant and can be imagined.

<h3 id="e110">Recent News on the Transformation of Guangdong <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>▲ Chen Jitang Appoints Qu Fangpu as Head of the Finance Department ▲ Representatives from Yunnan, Guizhou, Hunan, and Fujian Provinces Arrive in Guangdong ▲ Wu Chaochu and Others Go to Yong to Participate in the Meeting Guangzhou Correspondence: Chen Jitang, having taken control of the naval and air force, is now further engaged in expanding the new situation politically. Therefore, the rumors of Hu Hanmin, who is acting as a recluse in Hong Kong, returning to the province are rampant. At the same time, Feng Zhuwan, the head of the Guangdong Provincial Finance Department, was also dismissed from his post because of his close relationship with Li Jishen of the Central government. Chen Jitang appointed Qu Fangpu, director of the General Political Training Department of the First Army Group, as his successor. Mr. Qu assumed the post of head of the Finance Department and special commissioner of Guangdong finance on the 6th. Thus, Guangdong has become a completely unified situation. In addition, representatives from the southwest provinces are also gathering in Guangzhou at this time. It is reported that representatives from Guizhou Province, including Xiong Fazhen, Wang Jialie, and Gan Jingwen, representatives from Hunan Province, including Dan Hengjin, representatives from Fujian Province, including Wu Huqin, representatives from Yunnan Province, including Liu Peiquan, and representatives from Shaanxi Province, including Li Ran, have arrived. Chen Jitang has met with these representatives separately for several days. On the surface, they are discussing transportation issues in the six southwest provinces, developing aviation issues, military issues of suppressing communists in Fujian and Jiangxi, and the grand plan for jointly suppressing communist bandits in the southwest. However, whether their true intentions are as such is not discussed here. However, the southwestern provinces' plan to unite is undeniable. After Chen Jitang met with these representatives, the Southwest Political Affairs Conference yesterday decided to dispatch liaison specialists to Yunnan, Guizhou, Fujian, Sichuan, and other provinces to liaise with the authorities in each province at any time. Two members will be sent to each province. If the results are satisfactory, one member will stay as a resident representative, and the other will return to Guangdong to report. It has been found that Liu Hanhe, Fu Jianmei, and Cai Jianqing have been appointed as military liaison officers in Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi, and Gan Jiayi and Yang Qiufan have been appointed as political inspectors in Yunnan and Guizhou. In addition, what is even more noteworthy is that when Chen Jitang took control of the air force, Gui leader Li Zongren quietly returned to Guangxi, and Wu Chaochu, Fu Bingchang, Ye Gongchuo, Luo Yiqun, Cheng Tiangu, and more than ten others went to Guangxi on the 3rd under the guise of visiting the scenery of Guilin. It is said that they actually have a very important mission. The reason is that Wu's itinerary is directly to Nanning, not to Guilin. According to the Guangxi Provincial Government's telegram reporting the reception and protection of Wu's itinerary, Wu and others arrived in Wuzhou on the 4th, went to Guixian from Wu on the 5th, and arrived in Guixian on the 6th. From Guixian, they transferred to cars to Yong, and it is expected that they will arrive in Nanning on the 7th. It is said that there will be a meeting in Nanning, so the key to the changes in the southwest political situation may lie in Wu's trip. (May 7)</p>

<h3 id="e112">Detailed Account of the Red Bandits' Invasion of Longyan and Zhangzhou <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>▲ The number of bandits is actually only over 8,000. Special correspondence: The red bandits from western Fujian who invaded Longyan and Zhangzhou have been reported in previous newspapers. Here, we will further describe the actual situation obtained from the battlefield as follows: ▲ The Fall of Longyan The bandits who attacked Fujian this time were the pseudo-Fifth Army Corps, the Fourth Army, the Twelfth Army, the Thirteenth Army, the Fifteenth Army, and the pseudo-Independent Division, the pseudo-Thirty-seventh Division, and the pseudo-Thirty-eighth Division, totaling nine divisions. The pseudo-Fourth Army was led by Lin Biao, the pseudo-Twelfth Army was Luo Binghui's unit, the pseudo-Thirteenth Army was Zuo Quan's unit, and the pseudo-Fifteenth Army was Sun Bu's rebel army, with Li Zhentong as the army commander. These various forces claimed to have more than 10,000 people, but in reality, there were only over 8,000 people, with 6,000 to 7,000 guns. They all raised the flags of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army of the 某軍 某師. Reuters reported that it was the black-bordered red-hearted National Salvation Party flag, which was a false rumor. On April 9, the bandit army arrived at Dachi (a district of Longyan). On the morning of the 10th, they captured Xiaochi and went straight to Kao Tang, contacting the 291st Regiment of Zhang Zhen's 49th Division at Shipaiqian Longmen (15 miles from the city of Yan). The fighting was fierce. Although the bandits suffered heavy casualties, the 291st Regiment was isolated and suffered almost half its losses. At that time, Battalion Commander Wang Siyuan was captured, and Deputy Regiment Commander Li was killed in battle. Because the bandits were fierce, they could not resist, and Longmen was occupied. At the same time, another part of the bandits went straight to the county seat by抄径道 from Tongbo. Because there were no soldiers guarding the area, the bandits were able to drive straight in and approach the city. The Independent Regiment stationed outside the West Gate counterattacked in a hurry, causing chaos in the city. As a result, the Independent Regiment also suffered losses. Regiment Commander Zhang Xingbai was injured, and many company and platoon leaders were also killed or wounded. That night, Yang Fengnian, commander of the 145th Brigade, led the entire force to retreat to the Lantian Shantou area of Shizhong and camped. The next day, they shortened the defense line again and retreated to the area between Longshan and Mashan to deploy defenses. Shizhong was only guarded by Xie Yangqi's unit of the First Security Brigade and the militia who retreated from Longyan. The bandits wanted to attack Zhangzhou, so Shizhong bore the brunt. ▲ The Long Battle of Shizhong At dawn on the 13th, the red bandits used all of their 8,000-plus troops to besiege Shizhong from the east, west, and north. The security team and the militia rose up to meet the enemy. Because all the defensive works had not yet been fully prepared, the fighting was quite difficult. The bandit army used artillery and machine guns to cover their reckless charge. Fortunately, the soldiers of the team responded calmly and fought fiercely from morning to night. The bandits did not succeed in the end, and they suffered heavy casualties. The government troops seized more than a dozen Type 65 rifles and many other military supplies, so they collapsed and retreated. The bandits, unable to capture Shizhong, went straight to Zhangzhou on the morning of the 14th by抄径道, and the entire pseudo-Thirty-eighth Division guarded Shanglai Niubi Kong (separated by a mountain from the boundary of Shizhong) to contain Shizhong and prevent it from copying their rear, and to intimidate it. They bombarded Shizhong with artillery and machine guns every day. To this day, for more than two weeks, there has not been a day without fierce fighting. On the 16th and 17th, the bandits used night battles to charge recklessly, also with machine guns and artillery cover. The gunfire was also very fierce, especially the battle on the 19th was the most intense. The bandits went straight from Xishan to the Zuokeng Yangliu Si Dazhong Bridge position. Both sides engaged in close combat. Xie Yangqiu, deputy captain of the security team, took the lead and charged in a melee, killing more than 30 bandits and wounding more than 100, and seizing more than 20 Type 65 and 79 rifles, more than 30 hand grenades, more than a dozen broadswords (used by the broadsword team), and countless other military supplies. Since that battle, there have only been artillery battles. The government soldiers are extremely calm. The previous rumors that Shizhong and Zhangping had fallen are all false. The bandits have suffered repeated heavy casualties, with more than half of their men killed or wounded, and their arrogance has been frustrated. However, in order to maintain their connection between Zhangzhou and Longyan, they have to desperately defend Shanglai and use attack as defense to try to contain Shizhong. ▲ The Fall of Zhangzhou The red bandits, unable to capture Shizhong, used most of their forces to attack Zhangzhou by 抄径道. Starting on the 15th, they contacted the 49th Division at Mashan. The bandits were unsuccessful and went out of Yongfeng to Danai and袭取 Nanjin County. The rear of the 49th Division was surrounded, so it retreated to Zhao'an Pinghe. In a hurry, the losses were quite large. Chen Qifang, commander of the 292nd Regiment, was killed in battle, and two battalion commanders were killed in battle. Many company and platoon leaders were injured. After this setback, Zhangzhou was finally undefended. The bandits looted very cruelly along the way. They demanded 1 million yuan in Zhangzhou and 400,000 yuan in Shima. Reuters reported that the bandits did not harass the people along the way, which is also a false rumor. ▲ Recent Situation The Zhang bandits are now dividing their forces to迫漳浦诏安, with one part disturbing Anxi and Tong'an, trying to窜泉永. The bandits in Yan number about 1,000 people. There are also about 1,000 people in Shanglai, attached with artillery teams and machine gun companies. There are about 200-plus in Hekei, and there are also 200-300 people in Shuichao Jinshan Longshan and other places. There are about 500-plus in Shancheng. A part has already disturbed the Chuanchang Shangxiafeng, and the bandits in Hekei also entered Yongxi Bingliao today. Currently, the militia in the Kuiyang Changjiao area have stepped up their guard. At the same time, the Longtan Fushi Dapengkang Mayor Liukongfu and the people's protection teams of the 18 townships of Jinfeng, as well as the people's protection teams of the three districts of Nanjin, Kuiyang Quanlongshan Hekei Zhangping Yongfu, and the Longyan Quan屬保衛團, the First Security Brigade of Shizhong, etc., are forming a large-scale alliance to jointly suppress the bandits, and they have sent representatives to be stationed in various townships for liaison. As for the Guangdong army's assistance to Fujian, in addition to Huang Renhuan's division already concentrating in Hangcheng and advancing towards Yan, Huang Yanzhen's division has also arrived in Yongding, and the vanguard has been stationed in Hulei. If they can lead the army to advance rapidly, it will not be difficult to recover Yan and Zhangzhou in a short period of time. (May 2) Local Correspondence</p>

<p>▲ Another Robbery Case at Maihua Bridge At Maihua Bridge, more than ten miles northeast of the city, on the evening of the 10th, more than ten people armed with bayonets and ropes broke open the door of farmer Lu Haijin's house, tied up all five members of the family, and searched the place thoroughly. They escaped with their loot after about an hour. After the neighbors were awakened to release them, they checked the losses and found that they had been completely robbed. Lu was originally a poor farmer, and his residence was the tomb house of the Yu family in this city. It is estimated that the stolen cash, copper coins, silver, silk clothes, cloth, etc. were worth about 100 yuan, and three chickens and ducks each, and more than a dozen eggs, were also robbed. ▲ Appeal to Repair the Seawall The county chamber of commerce believes that the seawalls along the coast of Punan in this county are not strong, and if they are not repaired urgently, the lives and property of the entire county will be in great danger. It sent a special telegram to the Jiangnan Seawall Post-Disaster Committee, stating that the Jinshanwei seawall is historically the most important. A major storm occurred last year, and efforts were made to rescue the situation, which was temporarily avoided, but the construction project was not consolidated, and the danger in the future is worrying. It is requested that Xu, the head of the Songjiang Section Engineering Office, be ordered to repair it as soon as possible to strengthen the sea defense and maintain the lives of the people.</p>

<p>▲ Difficulty in Collecting Rent The Wu County Government was ordered to collect two months' rent, and County Chief Zou hired Xu Yu'e and 43 others as rent solicitation committee members to form a rent solicitation committee. Later, the meeting decided to collect rents for May and July, half of which would be sent to the province and half of which would be retained in the county. However, the entire rent solicitation committee wrote to the county government yesterday, stating that the Suzhou area was indirectly affected by the Shanghai war, and the people suffered heavy losses. They really have no ability to bear the burden, and asked to be exempted from the collection in order to relieve the people's strength. The landlords are now coming forward through their real estate colleagues to notify the tenants to postpone the payment of rent. The county government will submit a report to the province for approval and implementation.</p>

<p>▲ Silk Factories Are on the Verge of Bankruptcy The silk factory industry in Wuxi has been failing for years, and most of them are on the verge of bankruptcy. Even a few that are struggling to support themselves have completely stopped production. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, financial transactions in various places have been suspended, and commercial accounts have been extended from the end of February to the end of May. Now, the deadline is approaching, and the amount of money owed by the silk factory industry to the silver and money industries is particularly large. In the current situation, it is really impossible to repay. Moreover, the new silkworms are about to be on the market, and each factory needs a large amount of cash if it needs to collect silkworms. The money used in this year's silkworm market has had a huge impact. Yesterday, silk factory colleagues held a special meeting to discuss the results of the rescue measures: (1) The Silk Factory Association will forward a letter to the Money Industry Association, requesting that it consider the fact that the silk factory industry is on the verge of bankruptcy and allow the debts owed to be reduced in interest and repaid slowly. (2) As the new silkworms are about to be on the market, please ask each bank to consider lending money according to the resolutions of the Shanghai Congress so that each factory can start collecting silkworms and maintain the rural economy, and the workers in each factory can also rely on it to maintain their livelihoods. (3) In terms of business, those factories that have signed leases with the industrial sector have a deposit of thousands of yuan as a rule. Now, because of the suspension of business in the middle, the rent cannot be paid as usual. They should immediately discuss with the industrial sector and completely exempt the rent from January to April of this year.</p>

<p>▲ The Commander of the Fortress Has Changed Again After Yang Yunhua was suspended from his position as commander of the Jiangyin District Fortress, the military department appointed Chief of Staff Xu Jiaxiu as the temporary replacement. Later, He Shaozhou was appointed as the successor, but He did not take office. The military department formally appointed Xu to be promoted, which has been more than three months. Now, with the approval of the Military Commission, Xie Muhan has been appointed as the successor. It is said that Xie will come to Jiangyin to take office with Quartermaster Tan soon.</p>

Now, Zhou and others have captured Zhang Zhengyou, a bandit, in Taipingzhou, Yangzhong County, using an alias (Zhou Yonggui), and seized a box gun, seven bullets, and several pieces of stolen goods. He was escorted to Yangzhou on the evening of the 9th and will be transferred to the Supervision Department for handling after interrogation.</p>

<p>▲ The Miserable Situation of the Xinghua Disaster Victims Since the city was hit by a major flood, although general disaster victims have received emergency winter and spring relief three times, and soup kitchens have been established to distribute porridge for relief, due to the excessive severity of the disaster, it is a drop in the bucket. Most of the general disaster victims now use bamboo edges, grass sprouts, small garlic, and other grasses as food because they have no grain to eat. The miserable situation is unbearable to witness. In addition, there is no hope for the spring harvest, and there will be grain only in the autumn harvest. The days to come are long, how can we bear it? We hope that the relief authorities will quickly seek a solution for relief, which may save the disaster victims who are about to die.</p>

<p>▲ Robbery and Injury in Motou District At 3:00 a.m. on the 8th, three bandits suddenly came to Shen Xilian's house in Dashijia Village, Motou District, Rugao Southwest Township, armed with daggers, and broke into the door, intending to rob. Unexpectedly, the Shen family had no money, which aroused the bandits' anger. They砍毙沈 and left. In addition, the home of Guo Zijin in Ye Su Village, Huayuan Township, Chemahu District, was also visited by four people in gray short clothes with box guns and flashlights the day before yesterday. The owner, Guo Zijin, heard the sound and fled, but was shot in the head by the bandits, and his injuries were very serious. His wife, Qin, was also seriously injured. A total of three gold and silver pieces and 30 yuan in cash were stolen. The case has been reported to the authorities for investigation.</p>

<p>▲ The Tobacco Disaster in the Taizhou Area of Eastern Zhejiang The Taizhou area of eastern Zhejiang is located near the sea, and the customs are strong. Farmers privately plant tobacco seedlings in the countryside, which is everywhere. Although the counties of Linhai, Huangyan, Wenling, Tiantai, Xianju, Ninghai, etc. have repeatedly received provincial orders to ban them, farmers collude with bandits and continue to disobey in public and comply in private, which is really difficult to prevent. Now is the early summer season, which is the time for planting tobacco seedlings. The county heads of the counties in the area, in order to eliminate the scourge of drugs, have jointly telegraphed the provincial government, the Civil Affairs Department, and the Security Office yesterday, requesting that an artillery company be dispatched to Taizhou to assist in inspecting the villages in order to eliminate the tobacco atmosphere.</p>

<p>▲Discussing the Highest Principles of Chinese Painting with Liu Haisu. Dr. Rogers, an American educator, was specially dispatched to China by the US government to investigate education. He has stayed in Shanghai for a long time, making precise observations of our country's cultural undertakings. He also pays great attention to Oriental art. Yesterday afternoon at 2 p.m., accompanied by Director Xu of the Municipal Education Bureau, he visited the college to explore Chinese art. The college professors led them to visit the classrooms and observe Western and Chinese painting and teaching. Subsequently, they visited Liu Haisu's Chinese paintings in the college's Cuntian Pavilion. Dr. Rogers further inquired of Principal Liu about the origins and trends of Chinese art, as well as the highest principles and methods of Chinese painting. Mrs. Rogers also expressed her intention to engage in the study of Chinese painting.

<p>Pudong Middle School in Liuliqiao, Pudong, decided to suspend classes this semester due to the current situation. Now, more than 20 traveling Shanghai-based faculty members have gathered to discuss the matter.

<p>▲More Than 98,000 Students in the City Have Dropped Out of School</p>
<h3 id="e139">Three. Students Dropping Out of School <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>During the European War, even as the warring nations were shrouded in intense artillery fire, millions of young children diligently buried themselves in their studies. When faced with no other choice, they dug cellars to continue their education. During the Russo-Japanese War, Japan mobilized the entire nation, but elementary school teachers were absolutely not drawn into the vortex, remaining calmly in schools to train young citizens. They all recognized that students were the country's reserves, and reserves must be trained with utmost care. Looking back at our generally so-called reserves, what happened? Without a nationwide mobilization, but only a battle in one corner of Shanghai, the general reserves had almost nowhere to train and nothing to read. Until the end of April, when both sides ceased hostilities and loudly proclaimed peace, there were still nearly 100,000 students wandering astray. According to the reporter's analysis, their reasons for dropping out of school can be summarized in the following six points: 1. Watching the situation; 2. Economic difficulties; 3. Worry and fear; 4. Traffic obstructions; 5. Lack of good schools; 6. Family obstruction. These six points hindered their prospects and damaged the nation's vitality. Let's look at the number of students who dropped out of school. According to the statistics on schools, students, and teachers published by the Municipal Education Bureau in October of the 20th year, there were a total of 31 higher education institutions in the city, including 9 public schools and 24 private schools. The number of students in public schools was 2,671, and in private schools was 11,653, totaling 14,324. Among these, 516 university students dropped out from public schools, and 7,129 from private schools, totaling 7,645. The percentage of students who dropped out of school compared to the original number of students was 19% for public schools, 61% for private schools, and 52% for the entire student population. Why is the number of students dropping out of private schools nearly twice as high as that of public schools? The biggest reason may be that private schools charge higher fees. It is hoped that the government will pay attention to this and provide relief. According to the latest report from the Municipal Education Bureau, there are a total of 125 middle schools in the city, both public and private, with 28,514 students. The estimated number of students who dropped out this time is 15,000, accounting for more than 53% of the students enrolled. There are 774 elementary schools in the city, with more than 116,700 students. The total number of students who dropped out this time reached more than 75,500, accounting for more than 65% of the students enrolled. In total, more than 98,000 students dropped out of school. Seeing that nearly half of the students have dropped out of school is due to political instability, social immaturity, and families' lack of understanding, which allows so many promising young children to waste their time. The reporter knows that when Westerners travel to Shanghai, they still want to send their children to school for remedial studies in a very short period of time. In the current elementary schools, Western children often have short-term remedial classes for one or two weeks. Why is it not surprising in our country that students drop out of school for two months, three months, or even a year and a half? It is even more understandable when foreigners invade, and can be forgiven to an extraordinary degree. Commercial News</p>

<h3 id="e141">Plummeted by 19.5 Taels <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>▲US Maintained Silver Prices, UK Expressed Cooperation. Yesterday, the 12th, the price of gold plummeted sharply, with a small rebound. There was a difference of 12 taels throughout the day. In the end, the price dropped nearly 20 taels, which was due to the US proposal to maintain the sharply declining silver prices, the UK's expression of cooperation, and Hoover's endorsement of using silver coins to repay all war debts. Moreover, countries using the gold standard around the world are now abolishing it. Therefore, the silver market rose again yesterday. Various news spread in the market, and people were extremely fearful. The opening price fell sharply by 10 taels. Afterwards, the intake and outgoings of various parties varied, causing the market price to fluctuate slightly. However, the foreign exchange market was very loose and weakened again. The market situation was particularly depressed and almost collapsed. Suddenly, it broke through 710 taels, which was because the exchange rate was extremely tight and the banks' appetites were dull. It was unexpected that this low point would occur before the swap. The detailed record of the overall market is as follows:</p>
<p>▲The Opening Price Dropped 10 Taels The June opening price fell immediately by 10 taels and 2 qian, to 719 taels. Large bars were only long by 1/16 to 1/8. The silver price was 1/8, but private telegrams were large by 8/6, and the footing was poor. Citibank was making rapid progress. Next was 18.5 taels, followed by a 2-tael increase. Tongtaichang, Yifeng, and the Dalian Gang were all buying, while Tongfeng, Hengda, Tongcheng, Yuanheng, Hongkang, and Yongdeng were selling. It was likely that US dollars were sold at 31.625 yuan in early August, then half a yuan, and recently 1.25 yuan. From around 9:00, the price went from 20 taels to 17.5 taels, then to 20 taels and 0.05 qian. Subsequently, Hengxing, Yuanheng, Yushunli, Dadecheng, Fuchang, Zhifeng, and Yongqian Changxiang came to sell, and the US dollar weakened to 0.75 yuan in August. The English gold price was quoted at 18.375 to 18.4375, and the gold price plummeted by 6 taels. At 9:30, Yuanjing was at 14.5 taels, with a rebound of more than 1 tael, reaching 15 taels and 7 qian. The English gold price was quoted higher by 0.125, and the US dollar by 0.25. Then it retreated to 14.5 taels. Soon, Hengxing, Yifeng, Fuxing, Yongheng, Yushunli, and Dadecheng came to buy, and the exchange rate seemed stable, with the recent settlement at only 0.125. As a result, the price increased by 4.5 taels, reaching 19 taels at 10:20. Afterwards, Qianchangxiang, Hongkangyong, Richang, and others sold, suppressing the price by a small 3 taels and some change. However, there was a fluctuation of 2 taels in half an hour. The US dollar for August should have been sold at 0.625. Until 11:00, it was 15 taels and 8 qian. Suddenly, it increased by 2 taels, with a hedged purchase of 17 taels and 8 qian. However, the exchange rate was still loose, and the banks were unwilling to absorb more. The sellers in the market were still prevalent. It is estimated that Shunli, Bingxing, Zhaofeng, Changyuan, Tai, and others were selling heavily, so the price dropped by 4 taels, with a difference of only more than 1 tael. Until 11:50, it was 13 taels and 9 qian. Then the market closed at 14 taels, and the quoted price was changed to 793 taels, with a discount of 80 taels.</p>
<p>▲The Afternoon Market Collapsed The afternoon market opened at 13 taels and 5 qian, then at 15 taels and 5 qian. Because Fuyu Hengxing Yuanmao Yong and others bought, Yuanheng Fuchang Zhifeng Yongyuan Taikang Hengyu Qianchangxiang Futaiheng and others sold enthusiastically. Especially the US dollar became looser, and the banks initially absorbed August at 32.875 to 32.935, and then September at 2.0625 yuan, which was not easy to sell. Moreover, the Indian exchange rate was quoted large by four points, so the price plummeted by more than 5 taels, reaching 710 taels around 3:00. Afterwards, it seemed to rise by 2 taels, but there was a fluctuation of more than 1 tael. At 3:30, it was 12 taels and 4 qian. Because China Bank once absorbed August at 32 yuan, and September at 2.0625 yuan, the market fell into a slump again. Yifeng Yong Zhifeng Yong Qianchangxiang Fuchang and others were even more determined to sell, and the US dollar for September reached 2.1875 yuan. The market had an uncontrollable trend, and people were panicked and the atmosphere deteriorated. The price dropped another 4 taels, and finally ended at 08 taels and 3 qian at 4:00. At that time, short sellers and retail investors made up for the previous 1 tael, to 09 taels and 8 qian, with a slight increase of a few qian. At 4:30, it was 09 taels and 7 qian, a drastic drop of 19.5 taels compared to the previous day. According to the largest price of 20 taels and the smallest price of 08 taels and 3 qian in one day, there was a difference of 12 taels and 2 qian. The quoted price discounted 80 taels, and the final price was 83 or 84 taels. The book price was 14 taels, the interest supplement was 14 taels, and the red bar in the afternoon, plus 6 taels and 75 qian.</p>
<p>▲Sellers Prevailed The trading on the table was varied. According to statistics, Hengxing and Yifeng bought a total of 1,700 or 1,800 bars. Yuanmao Yong, Shunli, Wanxing, Tongtaichang, Taifengcheng, Wupin, and Yuankangxiang also bought. Zhifengyong, Yuantai, Fuchang, Yuanheng, Daxingyong, Futaiheng, Dakang, Hongkangyong, Yuhe, Qianchangxiang, and Mr. Wu, etc., were all selling short. Hengyu, Fuyu, Dadecheng, and others were very busy with transactions. In the afternoon, Hengxing, Fuyu, Shunli, Yuanmao Yong, and Wupin all bought. Wanxing, Zhifengyong, Fuchang, Yuanheng, Qianchangxiang, Yuantai, Futaiheng, and Hengyu all sold. Other firms had varied buy and sell orders.</p>
<h3 id="e142">The Exchange Market Was Very Loose <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>▲Overseas News Was Bad▲Gold Prices Continued to Decline Yesterday, the silver market rose again, and the exchange rate continued to decline. The HSBC exchange rate has been lengthened by half a point. It is estimated that English gold is 125, which is 7.75 pence per shilling. The US dollar has also been lengthened by 0.25, which is 30.25 yuan. Hong Kong is still 77 taels, the Indian exchange rate is increased by half a yuan, the French franc is increased by 4 yuan, the German exchange rate is increased by 75, the Dutch exchange rate is increased by 0.25, and the Singapore dollar is reduced by 1 tael. The banks are quite loose, but there is some fluctuation throughout the day, but in the end, it trends downwards. Due to frequent news that the United States has raised the silver market and that Siam is selling the gold standard, the gold market is very unfavorable, and the price has suddenly plummeted by 20 taels, breaking through 710 taels. There was a terrible storm in the market. As a result, English gold increased sharply by 0.625 compared to the previous afternoon, and US dollars also increased by 0.875. The forward price has already exceeded 32 yuan, which is unpredictable. Although the transactions of Chinese merchants are enthusiastic, they generally sell, with occasional gold hedging, such as Hengxing, Chengfengyong, and Dalian Gang. However, the banks' appetites are not good, and the total turnover is about more than 1 million yuan, but there are few scalpers. There are also 100,000 pounds of English gold, and many banks are doing business with each other. The gold firms have both income and expenditure.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Near and Far Large Bars Increase by 3.125 <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>

<p>Yesterday's foreign interest rate transaction was still not weak, and both supply and demand had appetites, so the interest rate could not rise or fall.

<h3 id="e145">The Bond Market Was Even More Desolate <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 12th), the bond market conditions of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, with a total spot transaction of 44,000 yuan, of which the 20-volume financial bonds each accounted for 15,6000, and the others were only several thousand yuan. The market became more and more leisurely, and large buyers and sellers in the market rarely entered and exited. Each plate had few transactions, and the turnover of the front and rear markets was only more than 500,000 yuan each, totaling 1,165,000 yuan. Among them, the 20-level customs, unified tax, and salt tax each had more than 200,000 yuan, and the rest were less than 100,000 yuan. The clearness of the market was only seen in recent ten days. As for the trend, the environment was still as dull as before, and large buyers and sellers watched and did not move. Even the situation of zero households was extremely cold, so the momentum of supply and demand was extremely smooth, and the price became more and more sluggish. The front and rear markets only fluctuated by 2 or 3 jiao, and there was no slightly large change from beginning to end. Compared with the previous day, the rise and fall were only around 3 or 4 jiao. Judging from the bond market situation, the market will likely become more settled temporarily.

<p>▲American Eastern Silver Company Report Wednesday Market Conditions: Compared to the previous day, there was no major change, and trading was still weak. The total turnover for the day was 700,000 shares. Industrial stocks and bonds closed slightly higher. Wheat prices continued to improve, and railway stocks fell by 0.32 points, mainly because the New York Central Railroad Company stopped paying interest. The situation of the Union Pacific Railroad Company was weak, and it was rumored that the dividend for this year would be a problem. Industrial stocks fell by 0.12 points for unknown reasons, but the decline was very small, mainly because people were indifferent. The hope for future securities price increases depends on the news from Washington. Regarding President Hoover's speech on Friday about maintaining the budget, it was well received by all parties. It is expected that the securities market will soon have better news, which is welcomed by those who make long-term entries and exits.

<p>The cotton yarn situation is very firm, and the trend is exciting. In the South China area, the buying interest is extremely strong. There are also developments along the Yangtze River, which has led to widespread optimism. The market is gradually tightening, and the trading floor is very lively. It has been observed recently that the amount of cotton yarn purchased from various parties is substantial, and the attitude of manufacturers has become more assertive. Some manufacturers have sold off a large portion of their previous inventory and are now considering raising prices, which has further boosted selling prices. However, there is still no significant improvement in one northern port, as it is occupied by Japanese yarn. The global cotton industry situation remains bleak, but the price of futures yarn is said to be lower than the spot price.</p>

<p>Foreign yarn futures prices remain tight, with continuous sales to customers and continued optimism. There are still many new long positions being taken, and there is a shortage of sellers in the market. Prices for each month have risen by three, five, or six mace. In the afternoon, the futures market was even more active. Short sellers viewed the environment as favorable, and buying interest was strong, especially for those covering short positions. Prices for each month rose by 1.89 to 2 taels. The total trading volume for the day was 11,350 bales. It was observed that Changfeng sold 600 bales, Dafu 700 bales, Jifeng 650 bales, Mingde 450 bales, Gengfeng 900 bales, Senkang 300 bales, Dachang 300 bales, and Yongda 250 bales.

<h3 id="e149">Cotton Prices Driven Up by the Yarn Market <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market continues to be firm, with a strong trend. This is because the yarn market has been active recently, boosting sentiment. The situation for foreign cotton is average, and gold prices are falling, but most are inclined to sell because the standard is high. In this era of old cotton, the future is uncertain. In addition, the stockpiles of local cotton in Shanghai are not large, so outsiders still have a strong interest in taking long positions.</p>
<p>▲Zheng Standard Breaks Through the 33 Taels Mark</p>
<p>The Zheng Standard opened in the morning market, and prices were flat with foreign cotton, with prices falling by five points for each month. In the afternoon, due to the good yarn market, retail investors covered short positions, and many new long positions were taken. The situation improved, and prices for each month rose by three, four, or five mace. The total trading volume for the day was 13,500 dan. It was observed that Tianlong sold 300 dan, Yuande 200 dan, Renfeng 300 dan, Yuanda 800 dan, Mingde 300 dan, Shenchang 1,200 dan, Yicheng 300 dan, and Ruiyuan 300 dan. Buyers included Xiesheng 400 dan, Yida 800 dan, Zhenda 400 dan, Changhe 800 dan, and Shenji 300 dan. The closing prices for Zheng Standard are listed below:</p>

<p>August term 33.05, 30, 39,800</p>
<p>October term 33.15, up 45, 54,200</p>
<p>Total 138,100</p>
<p>▲Cotton Mills Gradually Increase Demand</p>
<p>The mills' demand is gradually increasing, but the mills are unwilling to buy at high prices, so it is difficult for both parties to reach an agreement, resulting in dull trading. The opening prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Shaanxi Cotton 32.25, Shenxin buys 1,000 pieces of spot goods for delivery to the factory</p>
<p>Also 31.25, Weitong buys 170 pieces</p>

<p>Yesterday, US cotton was initially firm and stable due to excessive rain and a lack of sellers. Later, some long positions needed to be closed, leading to a retracement. Futures prices rose by 3 to 5 points, and spot prices rose by 5 points. UK cotton futures fell by 1 point, and spot prices rose by 5 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 15 points. The Indian cotton market was weak, with both Pingguoer and Bailuoxi falling by 1.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated the 11th):</p>

<h3 id="e151">New Silk Cocoons from Hangzhou Suburbs Enter the Market <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>▲Bad Weather Leads to Poor Cocoon Quality, Only 30% of Normal Harvest</p>
<p>In the Linping area of Hangzhou, farmers have greatly reduced the amount of silkworm eggs they are raising this spring, due to learning from the failure of last year's sericulture. In addition, the weather has been unfavorable, and the silkworms are in poor condition. Many were discarded due to the damage from the stuffy heat and extreme cold during the major molt. Although the new cocoons have entered the market, the cocoon production is poor, with only 30% of the normal harvest. The cocoons are of inferior quality, and only a few cocoon shops have opened for business. Improved varieties are priced at 25 to 30 yuan, and native cocoons are not being accepted. Many silkworm farmers are drying the cocoons themselves.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Stagnant Sales of Foreign Silk <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign silk market in Shanghai remained as stagnant as before. The European and American markets continue to be flooded with Japanese silk, imports are booming, and the factory price is still small. The price from New York is less than 500 taels, and the factory is still difficult to sell. Yesterday, only Yongxing imported 8 bales of spot goods of Mianzhou yellow raw silk, 24 to 3 threads, priced at 500 taels. Samsung imported 25 bales of Mianyang yellow silk, brand 3K, number 234, priced at 415 taels.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the situation in the foreign tea market, which has been attracting a lot of attention, was no longer the same as before. Although the Sui'an high-grade eyebrow green tea from the incoming firms had over a hundred new samples displayed, the foreign firms were not in a hurry because there were no ships departing recently, and most of them complained about the high price, and the negotiations ultimately failed. The local firms, such as Xiehe and Jinlong, slightly increased their purchases of high-grade eyebrow and needle eyebrow green teas, but the recognized price was much more stringent than before, and the market price plummeted by 14 to 15 taels. The tea merchants have all sent telegrams to stop the sharp rise in tea prices in the producing areas, so as to avoid repeating the mistakes of previous years.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Keemun Black Tea Arrives in Shanghai <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Zhongxinchang, Rende, Yongshen, Yuanyuan and other tea firms had transported more than 200 boxes of Keemun black tea. The results of the brewing test show that the aroma and manufacturing method are better than last year, but because the amount is not much, it is necessary to wait for the large batch to arrive before the samples can be officially displayed.</p>
<h3 id="e155">New Developments of Tunxi Tea Firms <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>According to a survey conducted last month, the number of tea firms in Yanghu, Shuaikou, Liyang, Gaojian, Baishuxia and other places in Tunxi has reached more than 80. This month, merchants from Wuyi and Xiuning have moved to Tunxi because it is convenient for manufacturing and transportation. Recently, the total number of old and new tea firms in Tunxi has reached more than 100, and the market is unusually lively. As the new tea is about to be officially opened and priced, each firm is busy preparing cash to ship early. However, the recent ticket prices and cash, after the robbery of the Dakang and other tea firms, the market is tighter than before, and the firms are slightly affected.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Slight Drop in Keemun Tea Prices <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Since the opening of Qi Fu autumn black tea the week before last, the price of Qi West tea has risen sharply from 95 yuan to 1120 yuan. The increase in the market is greater than before. The tea firms have been rushing to buy the first-class tea as the mountain households have reduced production this year, and they are now rushing to buy the second and third batches. However, due to the hot weather this week and the occasional hailstorms, it is not conducive to picking tea leaves. The sun-dried tea leaves are overly saturated with rain, making them hard and of poor quality, and the leaves are coarse. The tea firms are finding it difficult to supply the cash, so they are reducing their purchases and waiting for the weather to clear before buying more of the better-quality tea. The market price should be gradually decreasing with each batch, but due to the rush of tea firms to buy, the market has slightly increased. As a result, the cost of tea for the firms is higher than before.</p>

<p>▲22 or 23 Ships Arrived at Shanghai South Yesterday</p>
<p>The outbound traffic on this street was quite smooth in the morning, but turned sluggish in the afternoon. The rise and fall of Changxi white japonica and Su Tong rice was limited. Pingli white japonica was at its peak, but the lower grades were sluggish. Qingjiao, thin early rice, Ningbo rice, and store sales were slightly active. The opening was particularly tight. Currently, the particularly special goods are priced at 14.34 yuan. Chen Po arrived yesterday with a disk surface that has not been opened. The rare Yang Lu pointed goods are firm in the market.</p>
<p>▲Shanghai North</p>
<p>Yesterday, about 20 or 30 vendors came to the North Market. However, the market sales were even more active due to the bad weather. The buying interest from all parties was extremely strong. Changxi Northern japonica rose nearly a corner. The particularly special goods are still priced at 15.34 yuan. The thin early second crop rice is sold as soon as it arrives. The market is based on the original disk. The rare Yang Lu pointed goods are selling in detail. The market is following the trend.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Large Batch of New Transactions in Futures Foreign Rice <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>▲Long Grain Saigon Rice at 5.5 Taels in July</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market was quite active. The trading in this street was very strong, breaking through the dull atmosphere of the past few days. This is because the arrival of Dumi rice downstream on this street has decreased, and the market price has jumped to 45 cents, and there are not many high-quality goods to choose from, so most of them have switched to foreign rice. The foreign rice market is very active. However, because the current inventory is still sufficient, the foreign firms continue to sell. Although there are many transactions, the market price has not been able to rise. If there is a large amount of sales again today or tomorrow, the market can start to pick up. The total market transaction in this street was over 10,000 bags of small grain, priced at 10.065 to 10.042 yuan, and old goods were priced at 10.022 to 10.017 yuan. 1,200 bags of brown rice were priced at 9.48 to 9.38 yuan. 1,500 bags of Saigon No. 1 rice were priced at 11.78 yuan.</p>
<p>The futures foreign rice market has been silent for a long time. Since the Shanghai Incident, there have been no large-scale new transactions. The transactions are the unsold ones that each foreign firm had previously booked, and they have also stopped transporting cars to sell spot. Therefore, there are only returned goods transactions embellishing the market. Yesterday, Yuanli Foreign Firm sold a batch of long-grain Saigon rice for July, and the amount was very large. However, because it required a deposit, the market only opened for 1,000 tons, priced at 5.5 taels. Yuanxing sold 8,000 bags of Min Dang rice for one week, priced at 10.085 yuan, and traders sold 2,000 bags of red small grain for two weeks, priced at 9.083 yuan. Returned goods included 600 tons of small grain for May, priced at 5.05 to 5.07 taels.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the flour market remained weak. Sales in various places have stopped, and囤户 are waiting and watching. The factory's thinking is fixed. The factory price of high-quality goods is still shouting above 2.1 taels, and the second brand is willing to drop the price slightly. The spot sales of Bingchuan this month opened at 2.0225, and slightly decreased to 2.0125, but after a certain party bought it, it started to improve. The old Che brand is smoothly sold by each merchant in this street, and the price is fixed. The initial opening was 2.025, and the closing price was 2.0275. June transactions have already started to be sold. June Lao Che was priced at 2.05, and June Bingchuan was priced at 2.0475.</p>

<p>▲Transactions Still Booming</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was still booming in the public association market. However, the outgoing vendors turned to涌, causing the market price to initially rise and then fall, and also because the market plate opened strongly. The initial market transaction price of He sugar No. 24 coarse white sand was 13.55 taels, and after seeing the demand relieved, it quickly fell to 13.5 taels. The initial price of Hong Kong goods was 13.425 taels, and it quickly rose to 13.5 taels, and the market then fell back to 13.4 taels, and the market shape was weak. He Chizi No. 10 rose to 9.8 taels, and the trend was still firm. There were not many Taikoo sugar transactions. CW mark was 16 taels, HM mark was 13.95 taels, and PX mark was 11.3 taels. The market appearance was quite stable. Huaxin sold 800 bags of spot coarse white sand at the market price of 13.55 taels, and Zhenxiang opened 900 bags of Hong Kong coarse white sand at 13.4 taels. Zhenxin Factory sold 300 bags of coarse white sand to be delivered in ten days at 13.5 taels. Although the intent to buy was quite strong, the outgoing vendors were particularly 湧, and the market outlook was flat and lacking in spirit.</p>

<p>The purchase price of peach meat in the Hankou market previously dropped to 11.8 taels, and the goods were also considerable. Therefore, a certain line saw an opportunity to buy in first, and then it was noticed by the peers who bought the price step by step. According to the Hankou telegram, the higher-priced goods have risen to 18 taels. The rise and fall reached 5 to 6 taels in a few days, which can be said to be no small. However, the trend is still tight, and there is a sign of continued rise, because the stock is not thick.</p>

<p>White tung oil has not developed much in Shanghai due to the depression in the Hankou market. Only the Hangzhou market seems to have a bright spot. This is because there is a difference between thick and thin stocks, and there are also differences in sales. The Hankou market mainly relies on foreign Zhuang sales, but foreign sales have been sparse for a long time. Even if there are transactions, it is only dozens of hundreds of tons, which is not enough to add color to the market. It is heard that the selling to foreign firms has fallen to 18 taels, slightly weaker, and domestic sales are 14.23 yuan. However, the sales in the Hangzhou market are exclusively for inland. Since the situation has been stabilized, business in various places will be restored, and sales will also be active, so the price does not rise and fall with the Hankou market. According to the Hangzhou letter, each砠 needs 27 yuan slightly zero. However, there is not much difference between the north and south comparison. In the past, Hankou was always higher than Hangzhou, but now it is slightly consistent. Therefore, the Shanghai firms can calculate both places for purchasing goods. Although spring sales are hindered by the war, when summer sales are active, there may be a possibility of purchasing goods. I will write it down to see what happens later.</p>

<p>Weiyelai velvet 3T is the most widely sold. The various woolen and suit shops of the local customer group have all sold it. In the past, because the selling price was high, many buyers changed to flannel, so the market sales were clearer. This year, the opening price is still similar to last year, with each code wholesale counted as 3.15 taels. As a result, the sales are even more stagnant. However, there are not many who order this year, resulting in a shortage of arrivals, and the price can maintain the status quo. Yesterday, 2T Weiyelai shouted for 2.5 yuan, and 1T was 1.35 yuan.</p>

<p>▲Money Industry Held Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>The silver and money industries, with regard to the year-end accounts for the 20th year, are scheduled to have a general closing at the end of May. Now that the deadline is approaching, it is necessary to have some discussions. Also, regarding the issue of a two-day closure after the closing of accounts, it is heard that the banking industry advocates not stopping and continuing to operate as usual. The money industry is unable to rush to handle it due to procedural reasons and still intends to close for two days. However, because banks are unwilling to stop, money shops cannot be an exception. In order to achieve consistency between the silver and money industries, the Money Industry Association convened a meeting of all industry members yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM to discuss the plan.</p>

<p>The Public Concession's Works Department has been constructing road surfaces beyond the boundary in the Anhe Temple Road and Qiaodun Road areas of Western Shanghai. The Public Security Bureau has reported the facts and details to the Municipal Government. The Secretariat of the Municipal Government yesterday made a special report and protested to the Works Department.</p>
<p>To the Public Concession Works Department:</p>
<p>Regarding the case of Mayor 交下 市 Public Security Bureau呈 一 件, stating that the second precinct of the sixth district reported that after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese war on January 28, the Concession's Works Department took advantage of the government's lack of time to take care of the road rights, and secretly repaired the roads on various roads, and sent armed British soldiers to protect them and prevent passage. A total of five electric light poles were installed on Anhe Temple Road and other roads, and new coal slag was laid on the east and west ends of the road. New coal slag was laid on Qiaodun Road west to the east of the railway for two li. Fourteen electric light poles were installed. A new wooden bridge was built on the west end of Haige Road and Fukaison Road. The original wooden bridge in the middle of Qiaodun Road has been demolished, and the river has also been filled in. One-third of the Shuibang on Kaixuan Road has also been filled in. The above-mentioned roads have been secretly constructed and completed, and the situation of the secretly repaired roads should be reported for review. The reasons are the same. According to this, after investigation, the above-mentioned roads are outside the scope of the concession. Without the approval of this government, your bureau has arbitrarily paved the road surface of each road, filled in the river, built and unloaded bridges, and installed electric poles, which seriously impairs sovereignty. A protest is lodged accordingly, and it is hoped that you will investigate, transfer your attention, and reply.</p>

The agent or captain of the ship shall prepare a customs clearance application form, stating the ship's destination, route, and which regulations it is traveling under (Ordinary River Navigation Regulations, Inner Port River Navigation Regulations, or Special Jiang River Navigation Regulations) and submit it to the Customs for verification. Each Chinese merchant ship should also prepare a logbook to record the port where the ship clears customs, the destination, and all other itinerary matters. All detailed measures regarding this new chapter can be inquired about from the customs clearance officer of the General Affairs Section of this Customs. All ship merchants must abide by them.

<h3 id="e170">Banks Agree to Discount and Lend Against Maturing Public Debt Principal and Interest Coupons <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>▲Result of Negotiations by Coupon Holders</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the Shanghai War, all banks felt it difficult to discount bond principal and interest coupons due to financial relations and refused to do so. For this reason, the 内国 Public Debt Treasury Coupon Holders Association separately sent letters to the National Debt Fund Management Committee and the Bankers Association, requesting them to persuade the banks to make appropriate changes to facilitate turnover. Yesterday, the association and others have agreed with the Central, China, and Jiaotong Banks to make appropriate arrangements, and separately replied to the coupon holders association. The original letters are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲Reply from the National Debt Fund</p>
<p>Dear Sirs,</p>
<p>The transfer volume of the Jianghai Customs 25 attached tax National Treasury Coupon Fund Custody Committee is approved. The association has stated that the discounting of public debt treasury coupon principal and interest coupons is a necessary measure for coupon holders to turn around in finance. On the other hand, it is the most reliable loan for bankers, and the fact that the bond principal and interest fund is kept by your association proves that this loan can be recovered on time. However, it is difficult for coupon holders to discount bond principal and interest coupons to the bank, even for those for the current month. Coupon holders have no way to turn around, and bankers lose a reliable loan business, and the social economy is even more difficult to 활활. It seems that there should be a need for remedy. It is known that your association has close relationships with bankers. If you can discuss with the relevant banks to allow coupon holders to discount the bond principal and interest coupons that will mature before the stipulated 90 days according to the usual banking practice, it would be a great public sentiment. In addition to函 to the Shanghai Banking Association,函 should also be達 to inquire about the verification of the matter, and give a reply. The Central China and Jiaotong Banks have been函 and the three banks have replied that they are willing to handle the matter in accordance with the regulations. They will函 to inquire about the verification of the matter, and give a reply.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Li Ming, Chairman of the 内国 Public Debt Treasury Coupon Holders Association.</p>
<p>▲Reply from the Bankers Association</p>
<p>Dear Sirs,</p>
<p>The letter of March 19 stated that since the Shanghai War has occurred, each bank has felt it difficult to承 handle the discounting of bond principal and interest coupons. The Association has been requested to discuss with the banks to accept the request of the holder of the domestic bond to discount the public debt treasury coupon principal and interest coupon 90 days before its maturity. After sending the 函 to the Central China and Jiaotong Banks, it has been approved and the 函 has been returned one after another. They are willing to酌量 酌量 the matter.</p>
<p>The 函 has been forwarded.</p>

<p>The Chinese Taxpayers Association of the Public Concession yesterday notified all taxpayers and sent letters to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Citizens Federation, and other groups regarding the municipal general donation.</p>
<p>For the matter of the notice, the Japanese army invaded Shanghai. Residents in the Public Concession, especially in the Hongkou area north of the Suzhou River, suffered unknown losses. Based on public opinion, the association wrote to the Works Department to exempt the municipal general donation, so as to provide relief.</p>
<p>Now, the Bureau has sent a letter stating that, in the event of the Shanghai War, the tax payment capacity of the citizens who have been most affected should be exempted from the total donation by the Bureau to show relief. The Board of Directors attaches great importance to the matters mentioned in your Association's letter of April 12. And after careful consideration, it is believed that, as your Association said, the administrative expenses in the 界 are borne and maintained by the entire taxpayers, which is very clear. The Bureau is now revising the method of exemption from donations based on the losses suffered by residents in the northeast districts due to the involvement of the war, so as to be fair and not increase the burden on all taxpayers in the future. The Bureau's proposed exemption method is as follows (The method has been seen in this newspaper on the 11th).</p>

<h3 id="e172">Labor Union and Workers' Association Host All Sectors <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>▲ Report on the Proposal to Consolidate the Postal Foundation ▲ All Sectors Willing to Assist Shanghai Postal Workers' Union with Real Strength The Labor Union and Workers' Association yesterday held a reception for all sectors at the Yipinxian Auditorium to report on the fundamental significance of the proposal to consolidate the postal foundation and its recent progress. Over two hundred people attended, including Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Chu Huiseng, and Pan Gongzhan. Lu Jingshi and Fu Dewei, two comrades from the two associations, gave reports. Lai Zi Chu Huiseng, Pan Gongzhan, Lin Kanghou, Ren Jinping, Shen Junru, Hu Fengxiang, and Li Yongxiang delivered speeches, expressing their deep sympathy for the postal workers' current movement and their willingness to support the two associations with the strength of the people, urging the government to realize the proposal. The atmosphere was very enthusiastic. The reports and speeches are listed below: ▲ Group representatives attended the City Chamber of Commerce (Wang Xiaolai), the Bankers' Association (Lin Kanghou), the Money Trade Association (Qin Runqing), the Lawyers' Association (Shen Junru, Li Zuyu, Yu Congdao), the Accountants' Association (Yu Xiji), the Citizens' Federation (Hu Fengxiang, Zhang Yichen), the Taxpaying Chinese Association (Chu Huiseng), the National Salvation Federation of Various Groups (Yin Zhiling), the United Business Circles Association (Wu Zhihao), the General Labor Union (Zhou Xuexiang, Yu Xianting, Li Yongxiang), the Shen Bao (Shi Liangcai, Ling Qihan), the Chen Bao (Pan Gongzhan), the Dalu Bao (Zhang Zhuping, Ren Jinping), and representatives from over two hundred organizations including the Xinwen Bao, the Shibao, the Shishi Xinbao, the Telecommunications Workers' Union, the Fourth District Cigarette Workers' Union, the Ninth District Soap and Pharmaceutical Industry Union, various news agencies, and various labor unions. All members of the two associations were responsible for hosting. ▲ Chairman's Report Chairman Lu Jingshi reported, saying that he was very pleased to have leaders from all sectors attend today. The purpose of inviting everyone here today is to take this opportunity to report to you the significance of our association's consolidation of the postal foundation and to ask for your sympathy and support. The purpose of this movement is threefold: first, to merge the Savings and Remittance Bureau; second, to stop subsidizing airline expenses; and third, to maintain the administrative and economic independence of the post office. The separate establishment of the Savings and Remittance Bureau endangers the postal system itself and the public's savings. Since its establishment, we have been requesting its merger. As for airlines, our association believes that the government should allocate funds to operate them. The postal service is in dire economic straits and cannot afford to subsidize them. The implementation of postal administrative and accounting independence is the main reason for postal prosperity. Once it is not maintained, the postal service will inevitably be disturbed by corrupt officials. These three points are the fundamental purpose of this movement. We deeply believe in the natural duty of serving society. Seeing the deterioration of the postal environment, we have to be pioneers for the people, loudly call for action, and rise up to fight. We firmly believe that the revolutionary authorities will deeply understand public opinion and be happy to implement it. At the same time, we are confident that our purpose is bright and that even if there are other forces deliberately obstructing and attempting to destroy the postal service with thirty years of honor, our association and more than 30,000 employees will not hesitate to make any sacrifices to deal with them. After finishing his speech, he raised his glass to pay respects. Comrade Fu Dewei added that in the past ten years, the postal service has been allocated nearly 20 million in public funds by the Ministry of Communications. If the postal service had implemented special accounting, it would still be able to cover the deficit of more than 4 million this year. Why increase postal rates? Therefore, learning from past mistakes, we believe that consolidating the postal service's economic and administrative foundation is a fundamental way to save the postal service. Otherwise, not only will this postal rate increase not be canceled, but it will be difficult to guarantee that it will not increase again in two or three years. The future of the postal service is very dangerous, and the burden on the people will increase without limit. Our current movement is purely for the people and for the entire transportation industry, without any other purpose. We are confident that we will receive deep assistance from all sectors. ▲ Guest Speeches Chu Huiseng first delivered a speech on behalf of the representatives, saying that although the public actively opposed the postal rate increase, the government still ignored everything and resolutely increased it, which violated public opinion. The plan proposed by the postal workers is a fundamental plan to save the postal service. In the position of the people, we must urge its realization to achieve the purpose of consolidating the postal service and reducing the burden on the people. Pan Gongzhan said that the postal service and the customs were both founded by foreigners, resulting in today's achievements. However, after the postal rights were taken back, the government hastily bureaucratized the postal service and established a Savings and Remittance Bureau, disrupting postal administration. It is truly painful to say. In order to maintain the postal service and protect the interests of the people, we should first advocate that the Savings and Remittance Bureau be merged into the General Post Office. This matter not only requires the support of postal workers, but also the people should rise up and fight together for their own vital interests. Later, Ren Jinping, Li Yongxiang, Lin Kanghou, Hu Fengxiang, Shen Junru, and others delivered speeches one after another, and the situation was very enthusiastic. During the meeting, the representatives gave concrete directions for future movements and provided assistance with real strength. ▲ Chairman's Reply At the end, Lu Jingshi replied, saying that he was extremely grateful for the guidance and enthusiastic support of all the gentlemen. Our association and 30,000 postal workers across the country will resolutely fight to protect the postal service and strive for the benefit of all the people, even if it means going through fire and water, we will not hesitate to die. The meeting ended at 10 p.m. Minhang Chamber of Commerce</p>
<h3 id="e173">Telegram Requesting Exemption from Increased Business Tax Rate <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>The Minhang Chamber of Commerce telegraphed to the Nanjing Yuan and Ministry, stating: "To the Nanjing Executive Yuan, Legislative Yuan, and Ministry of Industry: It is reported that the Jiangsu Province amended the Business Tax Regulations, uniformly levying 10 per mille based on business volume or capital amount, which is inconsistent with the Business Tax Law promulgated by the Central Government. National laws and regulations are the standards for handling affairs. If there is a slight compromise, it would violate the original intention of legislation. Moreover, the business tax is only to compensate for the local revenue after the abolition of likin. It was originally a measure taken by the government out of necessity and is understood by our merchants. However, the originally set tax rate exceeded the provisions of the likin abolition meeting. Since the tax was levied one year ago, the revenue has been meager. Although it is affected by natural disasters, man-made disasters, internal and external troubles, the excessive tax rate and the merchants' inability to adapt are also the main reasons for this. The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance, due to the shortage of tax revenue, will steeply increase the tax rate several times. At this time, when the people are poor and businesses are declining and the market is sluggish, the existing regulations are already heavy and unbearable for merchants. To say that this can increase revenue is to put the cart before the horse. The late Premier attached importance to people's livelihood, and the government inherited his legacy and announced it to the world. Regarding the heavy taxes set by Jiangsu Province, we earnestly request the implementation of the virtue of likin abolition and saving the people (submit to the Executive Yuan) to stop the increase, so as to respect the legal system and relieve merchants' difficulties. Zhang Jingling, Acting Chairman of the Shanghai County Minhang Chamber of Commerce, kowtows. True Seal. Color Printing Association.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Requesting Exemption from Business Tax Again <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>The Color Printing Association sent a letter to the City Chamber of Commerce, stating: "Regarding the business tax in the autumn and winter seasons of last year, because our industry was affected by the war, either suffering from tragic disasters or business stagnation, at this time of commercial hardship, it is really unbearable to bear this burden. Our association had submitted the situation in a letter on March 22, requesting that it be forwarded to the municipal government for concurrent exemption. Although various industries have now reopened, the factories and stores of our industry in the war zone have been completely destroyed and are awaiting relief. Those who have not been affected have also suffered from economic depression due to prolonged work stoppages, and there are often requests for assistance from the association. Seeing this situation, our association really cannot bear to urge the payment of this tax again. After repeated consideration, the only thing we can do is to still earnestly request your association to truthfully forward the situation to the municipal government, showing consideration for commercial hardship, and approve the exemption of the business tax for the autumn and winter seasons of last year, so as to relieve the difficulties of the merchants. We express our sincere gratitude."</p>
<h3 id="e175">Memorial Service for the Late French President Yesterday <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 9 o'clock, French officials and businessmen in Shanghai gathered at the Catholic Church on Yongan Street in the French Concession to hold a Grand Mass in memory of the late French President Doumer. Bishop Hu of Jiangnan Province presided over the memorial Mass. A high altar was set up in the church, with elegiac couplets in Western languages hung around it. A false coffin was placed in the middle, surrounded by wreaths and flower baskets sent by various circles. Bishop Hu wore a black vestment, and the priests and fifth- and sixth-grade acolytes also wore vestments. The ceremony began with the singing of memorial scriptures, followed by prayer rituals, which were very solemn and quite tragic and solemn. Consuls from various countries stationed in Shanghai, Wu, the representative of the National Government and the mayor of the city, Geng, the representative of the municipal government and secretary, Dai Ji, the commander of the Songhu Garrison, Huang Qiang, the representative of the 19th Route Army, and hundreds of French soldiers were also present, making it a grand occasion for a time.

<h3 id="e176">Explanation for the Arrest of Koreans <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the arrest of Koreans in the French Concession, various opinions have appeared in the newspapers. The French authorities have provided an explanation: On the day of the incident in Hongkou Park, the French police were informed by the Japanese police that (1) the perpetrator arrested on the spot at the time of the incident was Yin Bong-gil, a Korean living in the French Concession; (2) this person confessed that the criminal intent and preparation were all in the French Concession. On the same day, the Japanese consul personally confirmed this statement to the French consul and requested the French police to assist in detaining 26 Koreans living in the French Concession. These Koreans were wanted by the Japanese judicial authorities with arrest warrants for conspiracy. It should be noted that under these circumstances, there is no extradition issue. In fact, according to existing treaties, any country that has jurisdiction over its own nationals residing in China can naturally execute arrest warrants issued by its judicial authorities within the borders of various concessions. This is due to complete rights. The judicial authorities only have the obligation to request assistance from the concession police. On April 29th and 30th, 11 Koreans were detained in the French Concession, all with formal arrest warrants issued by the Japanese judicial authorities. No one gave up their Korean nationality, did not recognize the jurisdiction of the Japanese court over themselves, and no one claimed to be a Chinese national. During the search on April 30th, Xu Xianda, a Chinese who was in a Korean's home, was taken to the police station for investigation by French police officers. As no evidence of a crime was found, he was released. All statements contrary to the above announcement are unfounded.</p>

<p>▲ Wei Yan Daily Accusation Case ▲ Sentencing scheduled for the 14th Fan Shuheng, a Hubei native, founded the Wei Yan Daily in the French Concession. Because he had not registered with the authorities in advance, and the published articles contained many attacks, and the newspaper did not specify the place of publication, the political department of the French police found out the location of the printing house and the editorial department, sent detectives to 61 Xiafei Fang and 573 Avenue Edward VII, and arrested Fan Zhiping and Chen Linyi, the owner of the printing house, seized newspapers and two plates of lead type, took them to the police station, and transferred them to the Second Special Court. The police filed a lawsuit according to the Publishing Law and the French Consul's Order No. 187. After the interrogation, Chen was ordered to pay a bail of 500 yuan, and Fan was remanded in custody pending verification. The details have been recorded in the newspapers. At 3:00 p.m. yesterday, Judge Zhang Chaozuo visited the Second Criminal Court for further interrogation. According to Fan Zhiping, he worked as a proofreader in the newspaper for three weeks, and there were three people in the editorial department. He did not know who was in charge. Chen confessed that Fan Shuheng came to negotiate for printing, which had been printed for three months. A contract was signed with no time limit, and the printing fee was 10 yuan per day. He did not know anything else. The court ordered the debate to begin. After the police lawyer Gu Shouxi debated with the lawyer hired by the defendant, the court declared the debate over and scheduled the sentencing for the afternoon of the 14th. Fan Zhiping was ordered to pay a bail of 200 yuan, and Chen was released on the original bail pending instructions.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Labor-Management Disputes at Commercial Press Reach Extremes <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>▲ Employees Refused to Collect Wages Yesterday ▲ Opposing Layoffs and Hoping for Resumption of Work Since the Commercial Press's Zhabei General Factory was destroyed by Japanese bombing, the company, due to huge losses, could not maintain operations and stopped the business of the Qipanjie Distribution Office as well. A plan was formulated to lay off employees, and from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. yesterday, severance pay was started to be issued to all employees of the General Affairs Department and the Distribution Office at 24 Ningbo Road to implement layoffs. However, the employees believed that the company's layoffs this time were illegal and immediately organized an Employee Hardship Relief Committee to discuss countermeasures and vowed to oppose it. Yesterday, when the company issued severance pay, an advisory group was organized to go to the payment place to advise the employees who went there to collect it. Therefore, although the company prepared a large sum of money yesterday, most people were unwilling to collect it. Labor and management seem to have reached extremes. The various situations are recorded separately below. ▲ Amount to Be Paid The company seems determined to lay off employees this time. The severance pay and compensation (i.e., retirement salary fund) to be paid to the employees and the withdrawal of the current and special savings have long been formulated and announced. The amounts to be paid are: (1) compensation fund (17.8% of the original amount of each retirement salary); (2) severance pay (regardless of the original salary, half a month's salary will be paid uniformly). If the income of the above two items is less than 50 yuan, it will be supplemented to 50 yuan. If the income of apprentices is less than 25 yuan, it will be supplemented to 25 yuan; (3) special savings (all refunded at once); (4) current savings (if the deposit is less than 200 yuan, it will be withdrawn at once; if it is more than 200 yuan, it will be allowed to be refunded in installments within four months). ▲ Results of Payment The Board of Directors of the Commercial Press decided to issue the various payments to the employees of the General Affairs Department, Printing Factory, Letterpress Department, Gluing Department, Parts Department, Gravure Department, Song Style Department, Tibetan Plate Department, Electroplating Steel Plate Department, and the first binding department, decoration department, cutting department, museum department, oil department, drawing department, full plate department, carpentry department, and the various departments of the Distribution Office from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. yesterday at 24 Ningbo Road, including severance pay, retirement salary, and current and special savings. However, all the employees of the company did not go to collect it. One or two workers who went to collect the money were also politely persuaded back by the advisory group organized by the employees. ▲ News from the Company The Aftermath Office of the Commercial Press, under the order of the Board of Directors, began to issue the retirement salary fund, an additional half month's salary, and all special savings that the employees should receive yesterday. The payment place was located at the old site of the Shanghai Bank at 24 Ningbo Road. Because the Employee Committee posted a serious notice prohibiting people from going to collect the money, and people were blocking and intimidating along the way, although there were nearly a thousand employees staying in Shanghai, and the company was paying by department on a daily basis, no less than two hundred people had already collected the money yesterday. Those who were eager to collect the money and return home but were blocked went to the Aftermath Office of the company on Sichuan Road to complain, and some inquired about the situation by telephone and entrusted others to collect the money in writing. The company also issued the money accordingly. The company will still be issuing the money at the original location today and tomorrow. ▲ Employee Advisory Group Yesterday was the first day for the Commercial Press to issue employee severance pay and implement layoffs. The employee side was really afraid that there were one or two ignorant workers who did not understand the truth and went to collect the money, so they specially organized an advisory group and stationed them near the payment place of the company at 24 Ningbo Road. When encountering employees going to collect the money, they would come forward to explain the great righteousness and persuade them not to go to collect it, destroying the spirit of cooperation among the workers and harming themselves and others. It is estimated that from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. yesterday, about ten people were politely persuaded back by the advisory group. ▲ Notice from the Relief Committee The company is starting illegal layoffs today and depriving us of most of the benefits we deserve. This committee vows not to recognize it. I hope that our colleagues and temporarily hired colleagues will not go to collect the money, so as not to harm themselves and others. This is hereby announced. The Employee Hardship Relief Committee of the Commercial Press. ▲ Four Workers Arrested Datong News Agency reported that the Commercial Press started issuing retirement salary payments at its office at 24 Ningbo Road yesterday. However, because the Employee Aftermath Committee had issued a notice opposing it, very few people went to collect the money. It was unexpected that at around 2:00 p.m., four workers from the printing factory, Hu Jialong, Zhu Guizhen, Wang A'jin (male), and Zhang Xiuling (female), went to the office to inquire about something, and a dispute immediately occurred, leading to their arrest by the post police and taken to the Sima Road Police Station. After interrogation, it was found that there was no other relationship, and they were released at 3:30 p.m. Fearing accidents, the company requested the Public Concession to send many Chinese and Western police officers to protect the office.</p>

<p>Since the Shanghai Incident affected the Jiangnan Shipyard of the Navy and work was suspended, more than a thousand workers, under pressure from livelihood, have been blaming the union. The union is well aware of the difficulties of both sides and has repeatedly persuaded and submitted reports to the director twice. For ten weeks now, there has been no practical solution. Yesterday, all the workers requested the executive and supervisory committee members to hold a temporary emergency meeting to plan relief methods. It was resolved to submit a report to the Ministry of the Navy and the Special Party Department of the Navy, requesting that the shipyard authorities consider the workers' difficulties and resume work as soon as possible to benefit labor movements. Fortunately, the Shanghai situation has been pacified, and the shipyard authorities are expected to sympathize with the workers' difficulties and provide relief without causing a breakdown.</p>

<p>The houses in Xiyongren Lane, Julai Road, French Concession, are managed by Xinglong Company. There are more than thirty buildings in total, built no more than fifteen years ago. The houses are very sturdy. Since the tenants moved in, the rent has been increased over the years. Last spring, the rent was raised again. However, the landlord wanted to raise the rent again in August, which was rejected by the tenants. Unexpectedly, because the tenants refused to increase the rent, the landlord notified all tenants in May of this year to move out completely before mid-June in the lunar calendar, in order to start reconstruction, etc. Hearing this news, the tenants panicked and convened a meeting of all tenants in the lane at 3 pm yesterday to discuss countermeasures. More than thirty people attended, and Shen Liangcai was elected as chairman. The following resolutions were made: (1) Organize a tenants' association; (2) Publicly appoint Shen Liangcai, Xinjihao, Shengyuanhao, Huangjinj, and Minglishe as five representatives responsible for handling negotiations; (3) First, the association will send a letter to Xinglong Company denying the reconstruction notice; (4) Send a letter to the Shanghai Citizens' Rent Reduction Movement Committee, various rent reduction associations in the French Concession, and the Xiqu Business Federation, etc., stating the situation of the landlord's failure to increase rent and using demolition as a pretext, advocating fairness and seeking unanimous assistance; (5) Investigate the statement in the notice that the 工部局 (French Municipal Council) has sent a letter ordering the demolition of the houses. The association should send a letter to the French 工部局 to inquire whether this is the case. If it is true, the bureau should be requested to consider the post-war economic downturn and the fact that the houses are sturdy, and withdraw the order; (6) Hire Li Ming, a lawyer, as legal counsel; (7) All expenses will be borne by everyone. The meeting adjourned after the resolutions were made.</p>

<p>▲ Ruihe Crucible Factory's New Product</p>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' Promotion of National Goods Association considers the new domestic crucibles produced by Ruihe Crucible Factory to be essential raw materials for factories manufacturing glass and other products. The materials are excellent, and the production is abundant enough to meet the needs of factories nationwide, replacing foreign goods and recovering lost profits. It is especially valuable to promote and sell them. Yesterday, special letters were sent to chambers of commerce in various provinces, cities, and counties, as well as national goods organizations, requesting unanimous promotion and assistance for production. The original letter stated: (omitted above)</p>
<p>Crucibles are essential raw materials for factories manufacturing glass, porcelain enamel, electrical porcelain, and other products. There has been no domestic production of these materials, and the loss of profits has been enormous. Now, our member, Ruihe Crucible Factory (Manufacturing Plant: 161 Xiaoshadu Road, Telephone: 34932; Distribution Center: 512 Yuxing Lane, Nanjing Road, Telegraph: Wireless Registered 0197, Telephone: 90992), in response to the need for industrial raw materials, has hired industrial expert Comrade Guo Yongkang, recruited patriotic workers with rich technical experience, organized factory affairs, and expanded manufacturing. The results are excellent, and the production is abundant enough to be adopted by factories nationwide. Our association has applied to the Ministry of Industry for patent awards based on the new product example of craft raw materials and has also resolved in the 17th meeting of the 12th Executive and Supervisory Committee to send letters to chambers of commerce and national goods organizations in various provinces, cities, and counties, requesting promotion and dissemination, forwarding letters to glass and other trade associations and manufacturing factories, encouraging them to adopt them as much as possible, supporting production, and recovering profit rights. This has been recorded. I am forwarding this resolution to you, hoping that your association will maintain domestic production, earnestly promote it, and look forward to your reply.

<p>▲ Son Refutes His Father's Accusations as Untrue</p>
<p>Cheng Zhongjun, also known as Axing, the third son of Cheng Weizu, a Songjiang native who used to work as a secretary in the Ministry of Justice, residing at No. 2 Hongyi Lane, Maisaiertiluo Road, French Concession, is twenty-one years old this year. He used to study at St. John's University and is now studying at the Law School of Soochow University. He is naturally stubborn and violent and has treated his parents with indecent behavior. Recently, he has neglected his studies and often provokes trouble at home. At 2 am on the 6th of this month, he quarreled over a trivial matter and drove his mother and grandmother out of the house. Then, he smashed the bed and cooking utensils of his mother and cut the telephone line. The next day, Cheng returned home and scolded him, but Axing even attacked his father. He was stopped by his family. Later, Cheng reported to the Xiafei Road Police Station, which sent detective Tian Shiqing to arrest Axing and seize the destroyed evidence, and brought them to the police station. Yesterday, he was transferred to the Fourth Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, where Judge Wu Fanglian presided over the trial. First, the police lawyer Fei Xizhen explained the case, prosecuting him according to Articles 293, Section 2, and 332 of the Criminal Law. According to Cheng Weizu's accusation, his son Axing has recently neglected his studies and gets up at 3 or 4 pm every day. He often treats his mother violently at home. The night before, when he was not at home, Axing drove his mother and grandmother out and smashed objects. Now, his maternal uncle is persuading him. He requested a postponement until Axing repents, apologizes to his mother, and is released on bail to prevent indecent behavior in the future. Then, he can withdraw the charges. He hopes that his son will reform himself. Axing argued that the plaintiff's accusations were untrue. He had been accused of the same facts before, and the court dismissed the case. He is studying at the Law School and knows the dignity of the law. How dare he assault his parents? However, the relationship between his father and son is usually not good, while the relationship between mother and son has always been harmonious. There was no destruction of property. If the court wants him to post bail, he can ask Mr. Shi and Mr. Huang to provide bail. He asked the court to see the truth. After the court lectured the defendant, it ordered a postponement to the 18th for further hearing.</p>
<p>Settlement of the Xu Estate Case</p>
<p>▲ 520,000 Yuan Paid to Daughter</p>
<p>Xu Qingyun, a deceased wealthy businessman in the banking industry from Ningbo, Zhejiang, whose beloved daughter married into the Fang family, a prominent family in Ningbo, hired lawyer Qin Liankui to file a case in the Shanghai Special District Court, demanding that her older brother monopolize her father's estate and refuse to divide it. The opposing party also hired lawyer Jiang Yiping to respond. Relatives and friends of both parties, as well as prominent figures in Shanghai, have now been appointed to mediate, consulting back and forth. As a result, the older brother paid 洋 (silver dollar) 520,000 yuan from his father's estate to the Fang-Xu family as a peaceful resolution.</p>

<h3 id="e191">Dispute Over Inspection of Passengers <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>▲ Accusing a Newspaper Reporter of Being a Communist Bandit</p>
<p>After the interruption of traffic on the Jinpu (Nanjing-Pukou) and Huning (Shanghai-Nanjing) Railways, the number of passengers on inland steam launches traveling to various places along the Suzhou River suddenly increased. Many refugees carried boxes and luggage, which had to be inspected by the Second Squad of the Water Patrol Team of the Public Security Bureau. Yesterday morning at 7:00 am, on the Shuntai steam launch, which was docked at the bridgehead of Bentang Alley and was about to leave for Qingpu, Jin Xiongbai, a reporter from 晨報 (Morning News), was sending his family back to their hometown. He asked that his jewelry box not be opened for inspection for fear of attracting the attention of bandits. Unexpectedly, he was severely scolded. Jin argued with him, but he was publicly accused of being a communist bandit and a reactionary. He was immediately taken away and falsely accused of obstructing the inspection and interfering with public duties. He was detained for four hours. Patrol Officer Kong Fanren, who claimed to be a Huangpu Military Academy student, was aggressive and insulted him. Based on one-sided statements, he believed that newspaper reporters should be severely punished. At 11:00 am, Kong personally escorted Jin to the Water Patrol Headquarters at Guanqiao, where Captain Liang inquired about the situation and promised to summon the original police officer for reprimand. Jin was then released. It is said that Jin believes that the squad leader and patrolmen of the squad abused their power and position, and used dangerous words to interfere with his freedom. In addition to seeking legal solutions, he also asked the Reporters' Association to question the Public Security Bureau. (Far East News Agency)</p>

<p>▲ One Yuan for Coffin Cloth ▲ 100 Yuan for Compensation</p>
<p>Xu Linsheng, a ferryman for the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company, overloaded his ferry with female workers, exceeding the passenger limit and had insufficient lighting, which led to it being hit and sunk by the Jingguang steam launch, resulting in the drowning of 26 female workers. At that time, the Water Patrol Police Station detained Xu Linsheng and Wang A'mei, the owner of the Jingguang, and handed them over to the District Court. Prosecutor Yang Qi has already dismissed the charges against Wang A'mei and filed a public lawsuit against Xu Linsheng. The case was concluded yesterday. Xu Linsheng was sentenced to four months in prison and had to pay one yuan for each of the deceased female workers, totaling 26 yuan, for coffin cloth. In addition, the prosecutor ordered the Customs to pay 100 yuan for each body as compensation. However, the coffin and burial costs for the deceased were still less than half of the amount. Fortunately, the Nanyang Company donated more than 130 yuan per body to make up for the shortfall, showing compassion.</p>

<p>The Hongdao Free School, run by the Chinese Taoist Association, has been registered by the Education Bureau and has achieved remarkable results. Even with the impact of the war, it continues unabated, so that children from poor families do not lose the opportunity to study. Its spirit of doing things is commendable. The board of directors of the association believes that the climate is changing from spring to summer, and epidemics are likely to occur. In order to prevent this, a free clinic has been set up in the association's hall on Qiaojiazhai Road, Dainanmen. Xie Qianggong and other directors have organized a trial operation and invited Confucian doctor Gu Linzhou to temporarily serve as assistant to the free clinic. The clinic will open on the 15th of this month, from 8 am to 12 pm every day. All poor and sick people who cannot afford medical treatment can go to register for consultation. If the clinic is busy in the future and funds are available, it will be expanded successively, more Chinese and Western doctors will be hired, and medicines will be purchased and distributed to achieve perfection. Because most of the area near the association is inhabited by hard-working poor people, the initiation of this free clinic is also good news for the charity world.</p>

<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>According to Mr. Cheng Qin'guan, manager of the Dafaxiang Hardware Store, to whom our firm represents, on February 4 of this year, an article was published in the news section of your newspaper stating that unscrupulous merchants were providing food to the enemy and have now been investigated. The article stated that Cheng Qin'guan of Cheng Daxiang Rice Store at No. 50 Wuchang Road, at this time of the Sino-Japanese war, dared to be so unconscionable as to continuously provide rice to the Japanese army, and that an employee of the store, moved by patriotic indignation, went to report the crime, and someone was sent to investigate, etc. However, this is a fabricated fact, entirely the result of an employee named Chen colluding with Zhang to extort money and, failing to do so, falsely accusing him out of revenge. It is, in fact, a defamation of our client's reputation. Before the outbreak of the war, Shanghai merchants were legitimately engaged in various businesses. After the outbreak of the war, they should avoid dangerous areas. How dare the employee Chen, unable to defraud him, retaliate by making reckless statements in the name of the public? This concerns Mr. Cheng's reputation. Our client has always admired your newspaper's prestigious reputation, and although you record everything you hear, everything must be based on facts. If you investigate whether Cheng Daxiang Rice Store exists at that location, the truth will be revealed. Since it is a fabricated and retaliatory act, we request a correction to clarify the truth. Based on the facts provided by our client, our lawyer has prepared this letter requesting a correction. We respectfully request the attention of the editor of the Shenbao.</p>

<h3 id="e205">Views on Tutelage and Constitutionalism (Continued) <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>Wang Zao Shi's third reason against ending tutelage is that past constitutionalism did not achieve good results, so constitutionalism should not be implemented now. But has constitutionalism ever truly been implemented in the past? Wang himself said that Yuan Shikai and the Northern Warlord bureaucratic politicians destroyed constitutionalism. Therefore, the poor results were the result of not implementing constitutionalism. If constitutionalism had been implemented, how could there have been Yuan Shikai's proclamation as emperor, the dissolution of the parliament, the infighting of the warlords, and Sun Yat-sen becoming an extraordinary president in Guangdong? These facts prove the necessity of constitutionalism and the sins of those who destroy and oppose constitutionalism. Wang and Yu scolded the bureaucratic politicians who destroyed constitutionalism earlier, so why did they become bureaucratic politicians who opposed the implementation of constitutionalism later?</p>
<p>The fourth reason against ending tutelage is that some people who advocate constitutionalism now are former bureaucratic politicians who are not worthy of talking about constitutionalism. Whether China should end tutelage and implement constitutionalism now is one matter; whether former bureaucratic politicians are worthy of talking about constitutionalism is another matter. If China should implement constitutionalism, then it should be implemented no matter who talks about it. One cannot reject the idea because of the person, nor can one abstain from eating for fear of choking. One should separate the matter from the person. Moreover, former bureaucratic politicians may not be worse than current bureaucratic politicians.</p>
<p>The above arguments against ending tutelage are the common opinions of Wang and Yu, but Wang's statements are more clear and organized. In addition, some of Wang and Yu's words need to be corrected separately.</p>
<p>For example, Wang Jingwei said: "...At that time, the Provisional Constitution and the Constitution were both created by Kuomintang party members to restrain Yuan Shikai and consolidate the foundation of the Republic of China. Therefore, to overthrow the Kuomintang, they had to destroy constitutionalism." From this, it seems that the Kuomintang and Wang himself originally advocated constitutionalism and believed that those who destroyed constitutionalism were wrong. So why does Wang now oppose constitutionalism and scold those who advocate constitutionalism? Is the level of the general public now inferior to that of the early Republic of China? Or is it because the Kuomintang did not have political power before, so they created the Provisional Constitution and the Constitution to restrain Yuan Shikai? Now that they have gained political power, they scold those who advocate constitutionalism to restrain one-party rule and consolidate the Republic of China?</p>
<p>For example, Wang said: "...China still does not have constitutionalism, but what is the reason for this? This is because since the Republic of China, constitutionalism has been destroyed by them once, twice, and three times." During the Beijing government era, the bureaucratic politicians of the past cannot but bear some responsibility for the failure to implement constitutionalism; but the biggest obstacle was still Yuan Shikai and his remaining Northern Warlords, which Wang must recognize. And since the Kuomintang came to power, who is to blame for completely abandoning constitutionalism and changing the Republic of China to a party-state? Former bureaucratic politicians, at best, only destroyed constitutionalism. The current bureaucratic officials fundamentally do not want constitutionalism. Why is Wang clear in blaming others but dim in blaming himself?</p>
<p>For example, Wang said: "Since the beginning of tutelage in the 17th or 18th year of the Republic of China, there have only been three years. If there were no internal disputes, it would certainly have been done better. But given the size of China, its vastness, and the complexity of the situation, no one can completely do well in China in one or two years." In fact, since the Kuomintang's dictatorship, there have been six years. Given the size of China, we certainly should not hope to do everything completely well. However, the Kuomintang, now claiming to be a revolutionary party and using tutelage as a pretext, should at least do better than the Beijing government era to be qualified to scold others and to be qualified for tutelage. But may I ask, in diplomacy and domestic affairs, where can it compare to the past? Only the degree of corruption, the speed of internal strife, and the means of betraying the country are worse than before. Before Wang came to power, he attacked the Nanjing government for not achieving results more fiercely than anyone else. Now that Wang is in power, he supports the Nanjing government more fiercely than anyone else. Why is there such inconsistency? In fact, the Kuomintang is doing badly, and there are facts to prove it. Wang himself certainly understands this. The so-called internal disputes are all caused by your Kuomintang civil and military comrades themselves, all caused by the enlightened and farsighted who claim to be under tutelage. Wang's own flip-flopping is especially responsible and has nothing to do with us common people. Wang has no remorse and does not admit that the Kuomintang and himself have the slightest fault, as if he still wants to put the blame on the heads of our general public. How can this be said?</p>
<p>As for Yu Youren's words, there are even more inexplicable things. Here are a few simple pointers to the biggest mistakes: (1) As Sun Zhesheng said, "Mr. Yu's biggest mistake is his inability to admit the past mistakes of our party (the Kuomintang), believing that our party is still a sound revolutionary party. Therefore, he believes that our party's ability to lead the Chinese national revolution is based on objective facts." In fact, the Kuomintang is now occupied by warlord bureaucratic politicians and cannot lead the revolution. In fact, it is increasingly becoming counter-revolutionary and is being revolutionised. (2) "The constitutionalism sought by our party is revolutionary constitutionalism, a revolutionary constitution; and only the revolutionary people can accept it and implement it." After reading all the political science books and checking all the dictionaries of various countries, I am afraid that I cannot find the term "revolutionary constitutionalism." Anyone with a little political common sense knows that "constitutionalism" and "revolution" are incompatible. Under constitutionalism, revolution is not allowed; under revolution, constitutionalism is not considered. As for the "revolutionary people," they do not need any constitution or constitutionalism. The reason why we advocate ending tutelage and implementing constitutionalism today is that the unrevolutionary people are demanding unrevolutionary constitutionalism. If we really start a revolution, how can we talk about constitutionalism? At that time, even if the Kuomintang hurriedly prepares for constitutionalism like the late Qing Dynasty, we will certainly ignore it as the late President did. As for "accepting it and implementing it," it is even more out of the question. (3) "During this national crisis, it is a matter of course to allow the people to supervise politics and guide them to participate in politics." If the people's participation in politics is a matter of course, then tutelage should be ended and democracy should be implemented. But Yu says that the people's participation in politics is a matter of course, while also saying that the Kuomintang's tutelage is a matter of course. Which one is a matter of course? Please tell me, Mr. Yu. In fact, with party rule, there is no democracy; with democratic politics, there is no one-party dictatorship. Both cannot be a matter of course at the same time. (4) "The party uses the form of democratic centralism to govern the party and politics, fearing that it will be too scattered, so why take the empty name of democratic politics and suffer the real disaster of disorganization?" From this point of view, Yu fundamentally does not believe in democratic politics, believing that democratic organization is scattered and harmful, and that the party uses it with fear, and the country will suffer a real disaster. From this, it can be inferred that Yu's thought is not only to advocate Kuomintang dictatorship, but also to advocate personal dictatorship, even monarchy. (5) Yu believes that ending tutelage and implementing constitutionalism is the proposition of the Communist Party and the Nationalist Party, and that it is supporting these two factions. In fact, the Communist Party does not care about tutelage or constitutionalism at all. Their means are straightforward. It is to revolutionize the Kuomintang. Although the Nationalist Party is more moderate, it is not very enthusiastic about this because they are also preparing revolutionary forces. Only teaching scholars like me who are unarmed and have a moderate attitude talk to the Kuomintang about tutelage and constitutionalism. (6) Yu opposes the democratic politics of the bourgeoisie. But what is the democratic politics of the bourgeoisie? What is non-bourgeois democratic politics? Yu did not explain it. But according to Yu's mind, we are afraid that we cannot even ask for the democratic politics of the bourgeoisie under the current tutelage of the Kuomintang. As for what Yu calls "revolutionary constitutionalism," it is simply deceiving the masses. (7) Yu bitterly destroys the Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China and Cao Kun's Constitution, but what about the National Covenant passed by the Kuomintang's national conference in 1931? Please review it, Mr. Yu. He scolds others as "warlords," as "bureaucrats," as "remnants of this era," and "dust of revolution." If Yu looks back at himself and at today's Kuomintang, what are they? Old bureaucratic politicians who rise up today to advocate constitutionalism, as Yu said, may not have the reason to seize power. But I dare not reject their resurrection. What I fear is that today's "warlords," "bureaucrats," "remnants of this era," and "dust of revolution" even want to seize power under the guise of tutelage and enter the grave. How sad! As for why I want to advocate ending tutelage and implementing constitutionalism, and my criticism of Sun Zhesheng's opinion, I will publish another article.</p>

<h3 id="e206">On the Free State of Ireland (Part 1) <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Kai Xu</p>
<p>There are many countries that occupy a small territory and enjoy equal international treatment. For example, the Free City of Danzig, which enjoys the dignity of independence with one city. Located among the powers, it can maintain its equilibrium. They guard their territory and do not invade each other. Another example is Monaco, whose capital is Monte Carlo, which is the gambling city. It maintains its independence by gambling. However, its territory is very small. If there is a riot in the country, no one can use artillery. Because the distance from one end to the other is very short. Every shot, if too large, is likely to fall into the territory of neighboring countries. Other examples include Bhutan and Nepal between China and India. Their area is only a few hundred square miles. As for the tragedy of being destroyed by huge countries, there were Poland in the past and India and Korea in recent times. Now Poland has been restored. Gandhi was born in India. Korea also has people like An Jung-geun. All of these are enough to represent the progressive spirit of their national restoration movement. The Irish Free State is adjacent to England. It is a small island. Shaped like a rabbit worshiping the moon. Among them, there are also great people. His name is Eamon de Valera. Abbreviated as de Valera. De Valera was born in the United States. His father was Spanish. His mother was Irish. Therefore, what he inherited from his parents was a strong and romantic personality. What he enjoyed in his early years was the free and equal air of the New World. Therefore, what he devoted his life to was Ireland's separation from the shackles of England. And the construction of an independent republic. He is not satisfied with the freedom within the cage. Now the freedom within the cage is still limited by the cage. It is not absolute freedom. The constitution of the Irish Free State. Article 17 clearly states that Irish officials should swear allegiance to the British Emperor. This is the cage of Irish freedom. De Valera has been immersed for ten years. Now he has become the head of the Free State. His first move is to cancel the oath of submission to the British Emperor. De Valera's proposal has passed the second reading in the Irish Parliament. The future success or failure is still unknown. War may break out between Britain and Ireland. However, the Irish people are strong. Not as weak as the Chinese. Their leaders are all unyielding men. Not like the rulers of our country who only know how to run after fame and fortune. Although Britain is determined not to give up its rights as a suzerain state. But Ireland is determined to fight to the end. Britain is exhausted. Unable to advance or retreat. How can it be like our government's declaration of long-term resistance today? Tomorrow, it will sign a humiliating agreement.</p>

<p>— Wang Haisusheng</p>
<p>The Xinhai Revolution. Invited the object of the revolution (Puyi, the deceased emperor of the Qing Dynasty) to step down. Replaced the signboard of the Great Qing Empire. Changed it to the Republic of China and treated the Qing imperial family favorably. Provided a pension. So that they could still live in the palace.</p>
<p>In the seventh year of the Republic of China. After Zhang Xun's attempt to restore Puyi with his pigtail failed. Puyi did not suffer any loss. He was treated favorably as before. In the thirteenth year, Feng Yuxiang returned to Beijing and only expelled this deposed emperor to Tianjin. Puyi, who lived in Tianjin, repeatedly wanted to travel abroad for further study. Our government did not pay attention to it. Did not raise funds for him to fulfill his long-cherished wish. Caused him to fall into the hands of the Japanese. Becoming a rare commodity.</p>
<p>After the September 18th Incident in the twentieth year of the Republic of China. The Japanese used the means of making use of waste. Kidnapped Puyi to the east. Our authorities knew about it beforehand. Did not prevent it. As a result, he was able to take charge of the new regime in Manchuria today.</p>
<p>Looking at the establishment of the puppet Republic of Manchuria in Changchun in March of this year, I felt touched. Looking back to check this old account. Speaking in terms of time. The period from the Xinhai Revolution to the seventh year of the Republic of China was one mistake. The period from the seventh year to the thirteenth year was another mistake. The period from the thirteenth year to the twentieth year was the third mistake. The period from the twentieth year to March of this year was the fourth mistake. With these four mistakes, a big mistake was made.</p>

<p>Free Talk is published at the end of the newspaper. Like the afterglow of a meeting. Like the end of a tune. Both solemn and humorous. Both elegant and popular. This is the work of the editor and the contributors. I have also been in the south for thirteen years. Graceful and charming. Like a young woman playing the zither. Such a long time has passed unknowingly. I have been contributing articles for the same number of years. Sparse and dense. Sentence by sentence. The so-called main theme is to advise the emperor. Those who speak are not guilty. Those who hear should be warned. Or it may be used to prove the present and cite the past. To follow what is right and correct what is wrong. As long as a word is beneficial to the people. Then the effort is not wasted. From now on. Eliminate national difficulties. Turn defeat into victory. The rise and fall of the country is the responsibility of everyone. Do not take the humble opinions of small newspapers lightly. Editors and contributors. Let's all work hard. Random words: Good to talk about the sky in Free Talk. Like singing a song and gathering immortals. Cherish every inch of time. How many thirteen years are there in life?</p>

<p>— Master of the Hall of Seeking Happiness</p>
<p>Chapter 6. Alas, pity for sharing a dream and being forced into a bed alliance. Still remembering first love, but breaking the promise at the window. At this point, An Yutian no longer had any resistance. Naturally, he agreed to everything and could not say half a no. Liang Xiaoyun was completely victorious and satisfied. She was so happy that her face was full of smiles. She immediately shrank back into the brocade quilt and also dragged An Yutian down. She gave him the sweetest and warmest kiss, saying, "Heaven has helped me. I have completely brought you into my arms. I hope you will trust me in everything from now on. I am definitely not boasting. I guarantee that our future is infinitely bright. I will help you become a great hero. We will always share the glory and wealth of this world. It is not in vain that I have put in so much effort today." There was nothing to say all night. The next day at noon, they got up together. She forced An Yutian to write the letter. In the letter, she openly explained Liang Xiaoyun's relationship and role. So that Li Wenxia knew that there was no way to recover. In addition, Liang Xiaoyun also signed a bank check. They were all sealed in the letter. An Yutian, against his will, sweating, did not say a word. He did everything. After lunch, Liang Xiaoyun dressed up slightly. She accompanied An Yutian to the apartment in a car, like escorting a prisoner. Supervising the relocation immediately. When entering the door, a porter greeted him and reported, "Mr. An, where did you go last night? That Miss Li came two or three times in the evening. She said that you had agreed to wait for her in the apartment. Why didn't you come back so late? She was very strange. Before leaving, she repeatedly told me. As soon as you come back, I will quickly call her. Who knew that you didn't come back all night. Her phone call came twice in the morning to ask. Do you want to call her first now?" An Yutian was just stunned. Liang Xiaoyun had already opened her mouth to the porter, "No need to call. Mr. An is busy moving. There is a letter left here for you. When Miss Li comes again, please give it to her personally." After giving the instructions, she opened her handbag. She handed over An Yutian's letter and took out a five-dollar bill to reward the porter. The porter was happily thanking her. Liang Xiaoyun was already urging An Yutian, "Hurry up and pack up. Don't let Li Wenxia catch you. It will be troublesome." An Yutian was flustered and also afraid of this. He was so anxious that he was at a loss. He grabbed around in the room. Liang Xiaoyun had to ask the porter to help. They hurriedly put the luggage and sundries in order. They didn't even have time to calculate the shop bill in detail. Liang Xiaoyun estimated and paid a few tens of dollars. He made it clear that whether there was a surplus or not, please send someone from the accounting office to Liang's house to settle the account later. They fled into the car with An Yutian and returned home. What happened next? I will write about it next time.</p>

<p>— Shi Ben</p>
<p>The Savior of the Unemployed... Giving Away Household Industries (Our company gives away household industries such as soap, dry batteries, cosmetics, and other crafts. We are responsible for success. Please attach postage stamps. We will send you the secret of the craft that will be tested, guaranteeing success and defeating deception.) Advertisements like these can be said to be in the advertising columns of various newspapers every day. Affected by the war, he is unemployed. He paces back and forth at home all day long, his brows furrowed, showing the pain of unemployment. Just when he has no way to go, he sees the advertisement above (The Savior of the Unemployed). After reading it, he feels that it does not cost a lot of money and the method is very simple. He is immediately overjoyed and hurriedly writes a very sincere letter, stating his willingness to learn crafts. He then buys the postage stamps and hurriedly seals them, goes to the postbox, and stuffs them inside. When he comes back from sending the letter, his face shows a joyful color, as if the happy god who saves the unemployed has descended on him. The previous frowning has become a thing of the past. Time passes so quickly. Since he sent this begging letter, half a month has passed. He looks forward to the arrival of this (Savior of the Unemployed) every day. He does not know that it is like a yellow crane, with no news at all. Although he has waited for half a month, the heat of hope has not diminished at all. He thinks that when people are unlucky, they must have encountered Hong Qiao. So he wrote a letter that was the same as before, bought the same postage stamps as before, and was afraid that sending it as a regular letter would cause it to be lost again. So he very cautiously went to the post office to add a registration, thinking that after this registered letter went, this (Savior of the Unemployed) would definitely be able to meet within a week. Who knew that he had waited for more than a month and still like a kite with a broken string, gone and never returned.</p>
<p>He was extremely angry. Calculating the losses, it also cost him some money. Thinking in his heart, how could he not receive it even after sending two letters? Moreover, the second letter was registered, so there was no way it could not be received. Then, why did he not receive a reply? Could it be that this advertisement (Savior of the Unemployed) was posted to deceive people out of money?! No, no, in order to deceive people out of these tiny postage stamps, he used a few dollars to post this advertisement, wouldn't that be killing the old cost? How could there be such a clumsy person in the world who does not know how to calculate? He thought about it again and again, but could not figure out a reason. He was suffocated, opened the newspaper of the day to read, ah...why is this advertisement still posted? Isn't it a long-term post? Alas, I understand, it must be using advertisements to cheat people out of money. As long as you think about it, there are many unemployed people in the society now. One person is deceived, it is limited, a thousand, ten thousand people are deceived, calculated, it is really not small. Alas, cheating the unemployed out of money is truly killing people without regard for the bloody smell.</p>

<p>Ordinary ink is written on paper, and the handwriting can be recognized immediately, which is too public. There are also various colorless inks, which leave no traces on the paper. Further procedures are required for the handwriting to appear. This is often used for communication in situations where it cannot be made public.</p>
<p>(1) Blue: Use cobalt dichloride (CoCl2), one part dissolved in eighteen parts of water. Write on paper with this solution. After drying, heat it slightly by the fire, and the blue handwriting will appear. Cool it down again, and it will disappear and cannot be recognized.</p>
<p>(2) Brown: Dissolve two parts of yellow blood salt in water. Write on paper. After drying, use a brush dipped in copper sulfate to paint it, and the handwriting will become brown.</p>
<p>(3) Yellow: Write on paper with copper dichloride solution. The yellow handwriting will appear after heating. Cool it down, and it will disappear. Also, dissolve four parts of potassium chloride and four parts of copper sulfate in thirty parts of water. Write on paper, dry it, and heat it, and the yellow handwriting will also appear.</p>
<p>(4) Gold: Write on paper with sodium gold chloride solution (but it should not be too light). After drying, use a brush dipped in 10% oxalic acid solution to paint it again and again. After drying, press it flat with a press, and beautiful gold characters will appear.</p>
<p>(5) Green: Dissolve two parts of cobalt dichloride and one part of nickel dichloride in fifty parts of water. Write on paper, dry it, and heat it, and the green handwriting will appear. Or use potassium chlorate solution to write, and after drying, paint it with copper sulfate solution, and the green handwriting will also appear, but it will never disappear.</p>
<p>(6) Red: Write with sodium gold chloride solution on paper. After drying, use a pen dipped in tin salt to paint it, (tin salt SnCl2 should not be too concentrated), and red handwriting can be obtained.</p>
<p>(7) Black: Use a brush dipped in concentrated lead acetate solution to write on paper. After drying, fumigate it with hydrogen sulfide, and black handwriting will appear. Also, use a brush to mix the white juice that flows out of the onion when cutting an onion and write it on paper. Heat it after drying and black characters will also appear.</p>

<p>— Wu Hezhou</p>
<p>Two college-student-like young men were talking: (How's life been lately?) (Still just messing around in school, wandering around outside school. Do you come here often?) (Yes, I come often.) (Probably here to "eat tofu," huh!)</p>
<p>Their conversation was taking place in a corner of ×× Park. At the time, I was also idly relaxing, so I heard them very clearly. However, I didn't quite understand the noun "eat tofu," and I didn't know what the "object of the action" referred to. I figured it was probably some kind of slang. I just heard them continue to say: (Your methods are clever, I imagine you must have a good harvest.) (Not very smooth, really the Misses are too cunning.) (But you get teased by them, right?) (That's right, last night I even got a curse from a CirlStudent saying "old three"!) (Haha...you were always a famous "hungry ghost"!) (We're comrades, no need to say more.)</p>
<p>Hearing this, I understood a lot in my heart. Looking at their well-dressed figures, I felt a wave of emotion, so I left them. According to the results of asking around, I learned that "eating tofu" is a synonym for "pursuing women."</p>

<p>— Fo</p>
<p>Under the lecture platform in the classroom, I found a crumpled ball of letter paper. Unfolding it, there was neither a salutation nor a signature. I only saw the words "pain beyond words" written at the top of the first line. Perhaps it was a continuation of the previous text? Now, I am publishing it and hope the owner of this letter will forgive me! Below is the original text: (The ceasefire agreement has finally been signed, despite the fervent opposition of various groups. I occasionally think of Yuan Shikai's downfall due to the signing of the Twenty-One Demands, and I can't help but break out in a cold sweat for the government authorities who signed the humiliating agreement!</p>
<p>Since the beginning of this semester, the professors in my class have been truly terrible. Yesterday, we sent two representatives to discuss the professors with the department head, but the response was: (During this time of economic hardship, it's not easy to even hire these kinds of professors!) (But we haven't reduced our tuition fees because of the national crisis!) said one of our representatives. When the January 28th Shanghai Incident occurred, I fled alone. Soon after, our dormitory was occupied by enemy troops. Undoubtedly, all my luggage was lost! But it is said that the first to rush into the girls' dormitory and plunder luggage by car was the famous football star of our school in Shanghai)...</p>

<p>▲ One of the City God Temple Image Records</p>
<p>One day, I fulfilled an appointment with someone to go to the Deyilou Restaurant in the City God Temple. I searched all over the second and third floors but couldn't find my friend's shadow. Because we had agreed that whoever arrived first would wait, I ordered a pot of tea and sat quietly. I sat there idly for two hours. (My friend failed to show up) confirmed for me the saying "(Chinese people are good at consuming time)," which was one of the weaknesses of Chinese people mentioned by a certain foreigner at a news media banquet.</p>
<p>They all had their left legs crossed over their right, swaying triumphantly, holding newspapers in their hands, scrutinizing them as carefully as if they were looking up words in a dictionary, or lighting cigarettes, tilting their heads back, and reclining in rattan chairs, staring blankly at the white smoke they exhaled, like Newton studying why apples fall from trees without wind. Most strangely, there were a few dazed tea drinkers, half-asleep, as if perchance some unusual sound were to occur, such as a woman's shout, they would open their eyes and look around. I later mentioned this to a friend, who said it was much cheaper than renting a room!</p>
<p>If four or five people came together, they could, of course, chat tirelessly for hours. In my two hours of imprisonment, based on my subjective observation, I couldn't find a single tea drinker who had truly come for the (tea). It was like the clock shop on Fourth Road having clocks, but actually, a crowd was gathered to listen to the radio broadcast.</p>

<p>— Bai Tao</p>
<p>The day before yesterday afternoon, a foreign lady and I boarded the same tram. This foreign lady was old and stooped, her hair snow-white. She took a seat in the seam of people across from me. At that time, I was very tired from walking, so I picked an empty seat and sat down. After one stop, a pot-bellied businessman and a woman boarded. The pot-bellied businessman was sharp-eyed and quick-footed. With three steps and two strides, he sat down next to me, crossed his legs, and turned to look out the window at the excitement. This woman who failed to get a seat had no choice but to stand there, waiting for a vacancy. The foreign lady across from me looked displeased, sniffed, and muttered something. I had already guessed her intention. Sure enough, she raised the cane in her hand and waved it at the businessman, signaling him to sit properly and make room for the woman. But he ignored her, put his foot down, and continued to look out the window. The foreign lady got angry, muttering incessantly, but I couldn't hear what she was saying. A compatriot with a mustache sneered behind her back, saying: (What a nosy old woman!)</p>
<p>Not long after, (wow) a sound suddenly came from next to the foreign lady. I hurriedly looked over to see what had happened. One of the Chinese women next to her spat a mouthful of phlegm, and (cough...) continued to spray it in her face. The foreign lady was furious, wrinkled her nose, and muttered loudly. She was warning her not to spit anywhere, and if she had to spit, she could spit out the window. Unexpectedly, this muttering caused the Chinese woman to (giggle) laugh non-stop, and the compatriots around her also laughed uproariously. The foreign lady was so angry that she stretched her neck and kept swallowing saliva. I silently looked at the crowd. I wanted to laugh, but I couldn't bring myself to laugh.</p>
<p>Yes! What a nosy foreign old woman! We Chinese people mind our own business and never bother with such matters!</p>

Ah, indeed, that's right, these are the proud children of China who are good at enjoying nature.</p>

<p>— Wu</p>
<p>Not long ago, this place was still filled with the earth-shattering sounds of cannons, but now it is the un-rhythmic sound of breaking stones that continues. The sun shines on every crack in this tile kiln, and a strong, fermented, musty smell rises straight up. The women who are breaking stones breathe in this debilitating air, using every last bit of their strength.</p>
<p>They are constantly hammering large stones into countless small pieces, each with a pile of this size in front of them. Hammer, hammer, hammer! Using all their consciousness and strength, hammer, hammer, hammer, hammering until sparks fly. The hard iron hammer strikes the hard stones, producing a crisp sound like the clashing of skeletons.</p>
<p>An engineer, unfolding his drawings, walks in from outside, followed by a large belly, walking unevenly as if lame, with a fine cigar in his mouth. The engineer points to the map, explaining his architectural plans. The large belly only makes buzzing sounds!</p>
<p>But this place is, after all, too noisy. Besides the sound of the iron hammer hitting the stones, there is the "heave-ho" of the workers driving piles in front, the roar of trucks transporting steel beams in the back, and a child in the corner tugging at the skirt of the stone-breaking woman's mother and crying. So the large belly couldn't help but run over and point at the stone-breaking woman's mother, shouting, (You old woman, you come to work, why do you bring a child here to cry? It's disturbing everyone!) (Sir, because he's hungry... I'm really sorry,) The old woman slapped the child's face and pleaded as if crying. Fortunately, the engineer came to invite him to another construction site, otherwise, the old woman would definitely have been kicked out.
