<p>時評</p>
<h3>國民必須注意三事</h3>
<p>在今日急迫情勢之下。我全國人民。都應一致認定我們當前唯一之敵人爲日本帝國主義者。尤其應以一致之堅决意志。一致之整齊步伍。集四萬萬人爲一人與我們當前之敵人拚死血戰一切黨派。都應放棄其政見。與黨或派之利益。集合於反日帝國主義爭取民族自由之革命旗幟下來。此時絶不容各持異見。各懷鬼胎。以互相率掣。終至於誤國。并以亡國。朝鮮之亡。不僅是由於日帝國主義者之侵凌。而其最大之原因則尤爲强敵壓境而内部黨爭猶紛擾不息。凡此前轍。皆我殷鑑。所以我們目前唯有凝結一片散沙爲堅牢之水門汀。而後可以言與頑强之勁敵相搏戰。否則適爲自殺。適爲自誤誤國。其結果必至永陷我民族於萬刦不復之深淵。</p>
<p>次之。吾人認定目前我民族唯一之敵人爲日本。故除日本以外世界各國皆爲我之友邦。吾人應以友善之態度。避免一切足以危及友邦人士之舉動。并保障其安全。吾人尤其希望世界各國基於公理及正義之立。塲對日帝國主義者之暴行。作公正之發言。吾人認爲日帝國主義者數十年來之野心與暴行。不僅爲我國之敵人。亦即全世界全人類之公敵。中國人民今已不得已而肩荷此反抗强暴爭取光明之重任。全世界愛好和平與公理之人士。都應予以鉅大之助力。</p>
<p>又次。我國人一方以全力援助軍隊之工。作一方尤應以全力維持後方之秩序鎭定惶懼之人心蓋後方秩序不安。人心不定即足以影響前方之工作因是之故。我後方之人民。應竭力維護地方之安全。金融界應盡力維護金融。工商界應盡力維護工商業。官廳各機關。應盡力設法。使地方人民鎭靜。免致秩序混亂。我人民尤應家喩房曉。勿爲無稽謠言所惑。人心苟稍搖動即足使不逞之徒。乘機騷動。影響前方工作甚大。此最爲必須注意之事。</p>

<p>（巴黎）今晨法國社會黨機關民衆報、載有遠東第二和平國際之請願文、該文請全世界勞工以壓力加於其本國政府、迫令中日兩國停止戰爭、並令日本撤退軍隊、以便開公斷解决爭端之途徑、（三十一日國民電）</p>
<p>美英政府</p>
<h3>又復對日抗議</h3>
<p>根據破壞國際權利原則</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美政府今日根據日軍在滬行爲破壞國際權利之廣大原則、又發抗議書送交日本、衆料英國亦將有同樣行動、（一日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美國政府對於上海日軍任意侵毁公共租界内美國財產一節、已决向日政府提出第二次抗議、並聞美駐滬總領事克銀漢、對於日本陸戰隊及便衣軍人、藉搜查軍火之名、侵入美人設立之法政學校（東吳法科學校）一節、已向日本駐滬總領事提出意見（三十一日國民電）</p>
<p>（東京）美大使奉華盛頓訓令、今日正式口頭抗議日兵以上海公共租界爲攻擊華兵之策源地、（一日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）美大使今日午後復將往訪芳澤、以期交換意見、消除誤會、外務省發言人述及美政府之照會、謂駐滬美總領事於滬案重要數點、似曾得訛傳之消息、蓋其報告華盛頓之事實、與東京所得者不相同也、英大使林德賽今日午後復訪芳澤、聞曾討論滬案、英大使並探詢日本處置滬局之計畫、（一日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦路透社探悉駐東京英大使林德賽昨夜接奉訓令、向日本抗議上海日兵之操切行動、並繼續用公共租界爲作戰根據地、此爲滬案發生後、英國第三次致日之照會、倫敦負責各界之意、在公共租界與閘北間闢一中立區域、照原定方案、無濟於事、（一日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）英大使提出之正式抗議、其措詞顯與美國相同、謂上海日兵之行動、越出必要範圍、致危及公共租界英人之生命、芳澤接抗議後答稱、日兵之行動、毫未越出必要範圍、並微露英國之抗議、似係根據宣傳家性質之訛傳之意、（一日路透電）</p>
<p>日政府</p>
<h3>擬派陸軍來滬</h3>
<p>外務省猶揚言不派</p>
<p>（東京）陸相海相外相今日會商後、試騐决定派陸軍一師赴滬、以代陸戰隊、此議須由明日閣議核准、始能有效、陸相語新聞訪員、謂如派陸軍赴滬、一俟大局許可即將撤回云、（一日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）外務省發言人今日稱、日本承認時局之嚴重、歡迎英美生力軍現皆調往上海之消息、日本陸軍省因恐國外發生誤會、故未派陸軍赴滬、否則此時至少當有一師團陸軍已出發矣、日軍鑒於或有之誤會、大約非俟列强或工部局當道直接請求時、不遣派陸軍云、（一日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）外務省發言人今日討論上海時局、謂上海發出無根據之消息、致造成誤會、而此誤會大都起於「土地佔據」及「作戰根據地」名詞解釋之歧異、美國斥日本佔據上海、然則美國長期駐兵於上海、果屬合法乎、如合法也、則何爲於日本派水兵登岸自衛時提出抗議、英國責日本以公共租界爲進攻根據地、要知日本陸戰隊僅會同各國行使一般防務計畫中所交與日本兵担任之工作耳云、（三十一日路透電）</p>
<p>京日領謁羅文幹</p>

<p>外交部</p>
<h3>向英美提抗議</h3>
<p>爲日軍在租界備戰事</p>
<p>（南京）外部爲日軍在滬向我軍攻擊、竟藉公共租界爲軍事準備、除已向駐京英美各領、口頭抗議外、三十一晚、正式向英美兩使館、提嚴重抗議、要求主持正義、不得以租界供日軍憑藉、同時電出席國聯顏代表、立向行政院聲明、要求制止、（一日專電）</p>
<h3>羅文幹電國聯</h3>
<p>（南京）羅外長一日晨電國聯秘長特拉蒙稱、頃得消息、謂各國報紙多稱中國擬向日宣戰、該項消息、全無根據、中國對上海事件、並非向日宣戰、不過採正當防衛此項行動、爲中國主權上應有權利、日本迭用侵略政策、進迫不已、中國始終忠實遵守國聯盟約非戰公約及九國公約上各種義務、然因日本對中國繼續施以兇暴的攻擊、中國政府不得不採取自衛上必要手段、倘日本停止其暴行與侵略、中國政府不致採取敵對行動、（一日專電）</p>
<p>蔡元培等抗議</p>
<h3>日軍摧殘文化</h3>
<p>（南京）蔡元培電國聯文化合作委員會云、此次日陸戰隊及飛機二十餘架、　在上海之閘北、横施暴行、故意摧毁文化機關、如中國最大出版事業之商務印書館·東方圖書館·曁南大學等均被焚殆盡、同人等謹代表中央研究院·中央大學·中山大學·淸華大學等、請貴會轉請國際聯合會行政院、迅速採取有効方法、制止日軍此類破壞文化事業及人類進步之殘暴行爲、（一日專電）</p>

<p>日政府</p>
<h3>承認浪人騷動</h3>
<p>（東京）政界承認上海日本浪人有越軌動作、謂上海日當局現在竭力約朿若輩、並嚴加懲處、聞已有二十餘人押解回國、此種擾亂份子足以增加大局之嚴重、而妨礙日當局之行事、政界對於此節、並不圖自掩飾、（一日路透電）</p>
<h3>英美報評滬案</h3>
<p>（倫敦）倫敦每日電聞今日社論、謂國聯得日軍抛擲炸彈轟擊上海之消息、爲之驚愕不已、凡日本之友未有不感覺文明國之名譽受此打擊者云、泰晤士報社論謂日本政治家如不能制止其海陸兵之氣焰、則世界輿論定將使之負責、又謂目前要着在積極利用上海暫時停戰之時機、過去兩日之事件、已證明國際行爲、須較國聯行動更爲迅速之重要、中日間一段關係之大問題、終必爲國聯事件、因中日兩國皆係國聯會員也、但若能使國際利益不受目前之危險、則對於遠東和平至有關係之各國政府、又何嘗不應於國聯努力而外、再致其聯合力量歟云、自由黨彙聞報今晨表示意見、以爲如欲恢復上海秩序、必須由國聯爲之、因國聯乃國際公法之最後公斷人也云、工黨每日驛報稱、國際强盜行爲而蒙容忍、則將來結果、必使各國連日本在内、悉受莫可補救之危害云、（一日路透電）</p>
<p>紐約東京傳來日本不反對國聯理事會調查滬案之消息、美國各報大爲寛慰、惟講壇導報稱、芳澤所發上海日人行動實爲時事所迫之言論、不能洗刷鹽澤少將用公共租界爲攻擊華軍策源地之過行、蓋未爲備日兵向任何方面可能的退步、除非向公共租界退走、以引華兵向租界轟擊耳、紐約時報謂國聯調查之行動、可予日本以體面解脫之路、（一日路透電）</p>
<p>郭泰祺</p>

<p>軍人愛國士氣奮發</p>
<p>敵雖頑强决難飛越</p>
<p>自上月二十八日晚間、日軍用鐵甲車砲車掩護陸戰隊及便衣隊、突向華界我軍防綫進攻、我軍爲保土衛民、作正當之抵抗後、二十八·二十九·兩晚、日軍大隊、數次向華界衝鋒、均被我十九路軍擊退、敵軍損失甚鉅、我軍大佔優勝、惟日軍當敗退時、舉火焚燬民房、以及飛機投擲炸彈、地方上之損失、實不堪言狀、本報記者、因欲詳悉此次戰况及地方損失之實際情形、特於昨日上午、應我軍當局之邀、親往閘北最前綫實地視察一過、當記者正在前綫視察時、敵軍頻頻以機槍射擊、似覺十分危險、但我軍所築之防禦工事、非常嚴密、而又蒙七十八師副長譚啓秀及吳營之引導、亦安然無恙也、茲將記者目覩情形、擇其可以發表者、分别紀述如下、</p>
<p>警戒綫外之擁擠記者與譚副師長會唔後、於上午十一時、共乘汽車由中山路方面、沿交通路直向東北前進、至大統路折向南行、但行人及人力車擁擠不堪、雖有巡警指揮、但汽車萬難通過、祇得退至交通路向東、經王家宅直赴中興路、至中興大戲院東首、即有我軍之防禦工事、下車後、譚師長即對記者謂、前面係警戒區域、前進即須注意敵軍之流彈、詢余欲前進否、余答、頗欲前往一觀、當由譚師長及防守該處之連長、引導前進、</p>
<p>日軍頻頻射機槍余等越過防綫後、由寳昌路折向南行、經過濓溪里口、有一小孩屍體、無人收埋、見狀殊爲痛心、寳昌路盡頭係寳山路、我軍在該處築有堅固之防綫、出此防綫即至寳山路、所有寳山路東面房屋、自商務書館起至虬江路止、盡成焦土、而該處前面、即爲我方之最前防綫、據某運長云、敵人即在淞滬鐵路以東大德里虬江路東段一帶、匿樓房内、時時用機槍向我方射擊、言時余等正由寳山路向南緩步前進、將進鴻興路口時、東面槍聲突然發放、子彈到着之處、歷歷可數、連長又云、余等恐已被其窺見矣、余等即速向北後退、至商務書館門前、昔日之高樓大厦、今則僅見殘餘之焦牆頽垣矣、本擬由寳山路再向北行、因聞北首天通菴方面、槍聲甚密、同時又因商務書館總廠對面之東方國書館、正焚燒最烈之際、於是從譚師長之主張、轉入寳通路、再由中興路朝北轉入寳興路、因前面即係天通菴車站、而敵軍亦在該東首架設機關槍、從事射擊、余等遂蹲伏防綫内窺探約二十分鐘、祗聞槍聲起自東北方面、但不見敵軍之形影、我方兵士均在防綫内看守、並不還擊、余詢譚師長、我軍何不還擊、譚師長答、我方尊重三日停戰之信約、故蔡軍長下令暫停還槍、余又訽如敵軍衝來亦不還槍乎、譚師長答稱、如敵軍衝來、當然射擊、</p>
<p>靑雲路形勢嚴重余等復由天通菴路向西至嚴家閣路、向東北方向進行、適遇第二營吳營長、向譚師長報告前線情形後、並再至天通菴路北段小河旁防綫視察十餘分鐘、譚師長因軍務紛繁不克久延、乃介紹吳營長引導余等往靑雲路同濟路一帶之最前綫視察、吳營長引余等至嚴家閣路與同濟路接攘處、北首係江灣路、余等行至小木橋南堍時、敵方機關槍聲、發放甚烈、而除近之墻壁上滿着彈痕、吳營長囑余等暫在南堍民房内稍等、待渠至最前綫視察、敵方情形後、再定前進與否吳　然去、越橋至最前綫、約十九鐘返、並引余等往、過橋、至第二防綫内窺視、敵軍仍在頻頻射擊、我方兵士始終置不理、亦不見敵方其他行動、吳謂、此處離敵軍散兵綫、僅隔三十米突、故此處之形勢最爲嚴重、退回橋南、復導余等登樓、天通菴車站即在目前、而敵軍之機關槍、亦即設在鐵路東首屋頂上、日本陸戰隊司令部、亦明白可見、把守機關槍之日軍兩名、時時用望遠鏡向我方瞭望、下樓沿小河、至靑雲路、在光明玻璃廠門前、有陣亡兵士之柩木七八具、北面之靑雲橋業已燒斷、橋南均係我軍防綫、西面至江灣路沿鐵路、亦均在我軍防綫内、余等至此、已下午二時有餘、遂與吳營長　别、表示慶祝勝利、並承另派衛士一名、護送至警戒綫以外、登車回館、</p>
<p>我軍之精神百倍駐防前線之我軍士兵、自與敞軍抵抗以來、爲時已有四晝夜、不但無懈怠狀、且個個精神百倍、各下級軍官、無不奮勇堅毅、在塲指揮一切、對於後方之民衆、親熱衛護、無微不至、故在警戒線以外各處、往來行人毫無驚慌狀、</p>
<p>東方圖書館起火記者於上午十一時行抵中興路時、即見東方圖書館著火甚烈、詢諸士兵、據云、該館左近有煤炭店、因日前總廠被焚之餘火未熄、至今晨（一日）七時左右、煤炭店忽然起火、無法灌救、以致郔及東方圖書館云云、至下午一時餘、始有閘北救火會之救火車一輛、到塲灌救、至二時餘、方始撲滅、而隣近之民房、始獲保全、</p>

<h3>美報發表正論</h3>
<p>恢復租界中立性質</p>
<p>應將武裝日人驅逐</p>
<p>大美晚報社論云、日本軍隊與携槍之徒、不僅失去其在上海保衛計劃中之效用、且已喪失其留居公共租界之權利、是以我輩今日關懷日本地位之心、已無異於日人之關懷我輩權利財產與生命矣、日本在名義上之地位、旣與中國友誼未絶又與他國協同保衛租界、但在事實上則日本正與中國作戰且以極不正當之道、利用公共租界中立區域、爲其作戰根據地、日人不僅以此種行爲妨害他日公共租界之地位、且以我輩所認爲極端不合之方法、自租界當道手中纂取警察權、而擴張其行使區域、至於他人當初所未嘗料想之地位並濫用此權力作種種行爲如縱火及屠害所拘之人等、是以公共租界當道應立即當衆表示、與此種過分舉動、絶無關係、並有以昭示公衆、使知他國及其僑民、絶未預聞任何侵犯中國之戰事、更應重行申明公共租界之中立地位、其他係外人安全居住之所、不能爲作戰根據地、當此中立性質旣被蹂躪之時、欲圖恢復、應立即要求下列諸端、㈠所有日本武裝隊伍、撤至租界以外、至少亦應將除保衛租界所必要者外、悉數撤去、租界巡捕復得行使職權、㈡解除日本便衣隊之武裝、若輩已自行證明爲一種凶頑殘暴不負責任之團體、㈢一切日本武裝隊伍、不得再在租界境内登陸、日人鑄此大錯、其可慘之記錄、已無術消泯、我輩今日所能爲者、唯有使公衆明瞭日本係孤行已意、至不參加戰事之日本人民、當然可以留居租界之内、與中國人民同受租界當道及各國軍隊之保護、但彼武裝日人曾辜負所託、而利用租界爲作戰根據地者、吾人唯有以二字對之曰「滾蛋」而已、</p>

<h3>Three Things the People Must Pay Attention To</h3>
<p>In today's urgent situation, all of our nation's people should unanimously recognize that our only current enemy is Japanese imperialism. In particular, we should, with a united and resolute will, and with coordinated and orderly steps, gather the 400 million people as one to fight our current enemy to the death. All parties should abandon their political views and the interests of their parties or factions, and gather under the revolutionary banner of resisting Japanese imperialism and striving for national freedom. At this time, it is absolutely unacceptable to hold different opinions and harbor ulterior motives, leading to mutual obstruction and ultimately harming the country and leading to its demise. The fall of Korea was not only due to the invasion of Japanese imperialism, but its greatest cause was the internal party strife that continued unabated despite the pressure of a strong enemy. All these past examples are a profound lesson for us. Therefore, we must now consolidate a pile of loose sand into a solid cement before we can talk about fighting the stubborn and powerful enemy. Otherwise, it would be suicide, self-deception, and harming the country, and the result would be to plunge our nation into an abyss of eternal doom.</p>
<p>Secondly, we recognize that our nation's only current enemy is Japan. Therefore, all countries in the world except Japan are our friendly nations. We should maintain a friendly attitude and avoid any actions that could endanger people from friendly nations, and protect their safety. In particular, we hope that all countries in the world, based on the principles of justice and righteousness, will make fair statements regarding the atrocities of Japanese imperialism. We believe that the ambitions and atrocities of Japanese imperialism over the past few decades are not only the enemy of our country, but also the common enemy of the entire world and all mankind. The Chinese people have now been forced to shoulder the heavy responsibility of resisting tyranny and striving for light. All peace-loving and just people in the world should provide great assistance.</p>
<p>Furthermore, while our people are doing their best to assist the army, they should also do their best to maintain order in the rear and calm the hearts of the fearful. If the rear is in disorder and people's hearts are unstable, it will be enough to affect the work at the front. Therefore, our people in the rear should do their best to maintain local security, the financial community should do their best to maintain finance, and the industrial and commercial sectors should do their best to maintain industry and commerce. Government offices and agencies should do their best to find ways to calm the local people and prevent disorder. Our people should especially be made aware in every household not to be misled by unfounded rumors. If people's hearts waver even slightly, it will be enough for unscrupulous individuals to take the opportunity to cause unrest, which will greatly affect the work at the front. This is the most important thing to pay attention to.</p>

<h3>Japanese Warships at Shimonoseki Provoke</h3>
<p>Last night, they bombarded the city and the train station. Our army did not retaliate.</p>
<p>The British government advises China and Japan to accept the Shanghai Neutral Zone plan.</p>
<p>Japanese troops shell Nanjing.</p>
<h3>The Lion Mountain Fort Has Not Retaliated</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) At 11:20 PM, the Japanese warships anchored at Shimonoseki suddenly opened fire on our city, with machine guns, mortars, and cannons firing simultaneously, and searchlights scanning in all directions. Our army was ordered to be on strict alert and has not yet retaliated. (2nd Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Just after 11:00 PM, Japanese marines between Shimonoseki and the train station fired guns at a Chinese patrol team. Japanese warships then fired more than twenty shells, bombarding the Lion Mountain Fort. Several shells hit, but the fort did not return fire, awaiting orders. All electric lights were turned off at 3:00 AM, and the airfield illuminated the sky with searchlights to prevent Japanese planes from bombing from the air. The Chinese army immediately occupied various positions along the river to prepare for resistance, but the Japanese soldiers did not land. Then, Chinese and Japanese soldiers exchanged fire with machine guns and rifles for an hour and a half, ceasing at 1:00 AM. The fort did not return fire throughout. There were foreign witnesses to prove it. (2nd Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Japanese warships fired more than twenty shells. Machine guns and rifles stopped at 1:00 AM, seemingly to prevent our army on the north bank from crossing the river. We did not retaliate. Consuls urgently ordered expatriates to prepare to leave Nanjing. Security police were all on duty. The city is safe. (1st Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A newly arrived Japanese destroyer at Shimonoseki came from upstream. There are many Japanese expatriates on board, as well as sentries, but no marines. British and American ship captains visit Japanese warships as usual. Merchants in Shimonoseki are moving to the city, but the government is advising them to remain calm and not cause trouble. (31st Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The overall situation here remains tense. Japanese sailors are currently guarding the Osaka Shosen Kaisha wharf. The Japanese navy will use this as a landing site. Chinese soldiers are guarding key locations along the river and building sandbag fortifications on the city walls, mounting machine guns. Residents of Shimonoseki are now moving into the city, hoping to avoid bombardment by Japanese warships. (1st Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The long-distance bus service here is booming. Because the Nanjing-Shanghai road cannot be directly accessed, thousands of people take buses from Nanjing to Hangzhou every day. The fare is normally 60 yuan, but yesterday it rose to 120 yuan, and today it rose to 160 yuan. It takes 12-13 hours from Nanjing to Hangzhou. (1st Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Local News: Mayor Wu Tiecheng received a long-distance phone call from He Yingqin, Minister of Military Affairs of the Nanjing Government, at 11:45 PM last night, stating that Japanese warships at Shimonoseki suddenly opened fire on our Lion Mountain Fort at 11:05 PM. Our side was on high alert but had not retaliated. Mayor Wu received another phone call from Minister He at 1:20 AM this morning, stating that Japanese warships had fired a total of six empty shells at Lion Mountain. They intended to provoke, so our side did not retaliate. There were no further actions by Japanese warships, and the area remains very quiet.</p>
<p>Government Agencies</p>
<h3>All Moved to Luoyang to Conduct Business</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) All departments, ministries, commissions, and offices of the National Government, in accordance with the order of the National Government, moved to Luoyang to conduct business. They all complied with the order to rush to send all seals and archives to Luoyang in the past two days. All large and small staff also went along with them. Currently, only a minimum number of unassigned staff or guards remain in various agencies. Today, the National Government also issued a notice that all documents and telegrams should be sent and received directly from Luoyang. (1st Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government has just telegraphed all provincial and municipal governments that all ministries and commissions under the Central Government have moved to Luoyang, and official business in Nanjing has formally ceased. (1st Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Li Tiaosheng, Permanent Vice Minister of Finance, Zheng Lai, Director of the Public Debt Department, Yu Meisun, Director of the Treasury Department, Qin Fen, Director of the Accounting Department, and Zeng Zongjian, Secretary, arrived in Nanjing by ship from Shanghai on the 1st and went to the Ministry to conduct business. (1st Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yu Feipeng, Vice Minister of Communications, was ordered to go to Luoyang on the 1st to handle transportation matters. (1st Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Tan Zhen, Vice President of the Legislative Yuan, left Nanjing for Luoyang on the 31st. All members of the Legislative Yuan held a discussion meeting on the morning of the 1st and decided that the members in Nanjing would remain to await government orders. (1st Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Tan Yong, Secretary of the Executive Yuan, and other important officials, as well as more than 20 important officials from the Ministry of Communications and Railways and the Ministry of Finance, carried important documents to Luoyang on the 1st to conduct business. The General Staff Headquarters also plans to move there within days. (1st Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Executive Yuan selected 10 staff members from its subordinate ministries and commissions to go to Luoyang to conduct business. (31st Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) With the National Government moving, the General Staff Headquarters will temporarily be located in Zhengzhou. The Ministries of Finance, Foreign Affairs, and Military Affairs will remain in Nanjing. (1st Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>Lin, Wang, Feng, etc. Arrive in Bian</h3>
<p>Wang Jingwei Delivers a Speech in Xuzhou</p>
<p>(Beiping) A Zhengzhou telegram reports that Lin, Wang, Feng, etc. arrived in Bian at 7:00 PM on the 31st. They decided to use the old superintendent's office of the Longhai Railway as their headquarters when they arrive in Zhengzhou today and will not move to Luoyang for the time being. Jiang will also arrive later. Song Ziwen will stay in the foreign houses numbers 21 and 22 of the Longhai Railway. (1st Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Wang Jingwei, at the Xuzhou station, gave a speech to reporters, saying that the central government firmly refuses to directly negotiate diplomacy with Japan. The initial decision not to resist was still in hopes of peace and avoiding war. Now that violent Japan is pressing step by step, the decision is to carry out legitimate self-defense on the one hand and ask for international arbitration on the other. The government's move to Luoyang is by no means a passive move to avoid danger, but an active preparation for resistance, because the government is the highest political and legal authority in the country, and not the life of a territorial official that can be risked. The national hub must be protected to lead the people of the whole country for a thorough struggle. Turkey overthrew the Treaty of Sevres with the new government of Ankara and won the Lausanne Conference, which can serve as an example. As for the overall plan for Japan, the central government has also decided that Mr. Chen advocated severing relations with Japan, but I could not agree, because if we announce the severance of relations, all countries can remain neutral. My political views with Mr. Jiang were different in the past, but now we are united in sincerity and are working together to overcome national difficulties, determined to take advantage of the spirit of common struggle to fight for the personality of the country and the nation. Wang was wearing a long gown, and his attitude was very calm during the speech. His face showed signs of illness, but his spirit was still good. (31st Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>All Japanese Nationals in Nanjing Leave the Country</h3>

<h3>Holds City Defense Meeting</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) At 2:00 PM today, military and police officers held a city defense meeting at the Training and Supervision Department to discuss the opening and closing times of each city gate, as well as measures to prevent rumors and strictly guard against petty thieves, and plan to issue a bulletin within days so that people will not panic each other.

<p>The British Government Agrees</p>
<h3>To Establish a Shanghai Neutral Zone</h3>
<p>The Japanese Do Not Agree to Foreign Troops Taking Over</p>
<p>The British Foreign Office in London issued a communique stating that a meeting was held in Xiang's residence today, attended by Prime Minister MacDonald, Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain, Foreign Secretary Simon, First Lord of the Admiralty Monsell, and Chief of Staff Miller, to discuss the situation in Shanghai and the status of the army and navy. The communique also stated that a meeting was held in Shanghai today, chaired by the British Consul-General, and attended by the American Consul-General and the Chinese and Japanese commanders. The meeting proposed establishing a neutral zone between the Chinese and Japanese armies, guarded by neutral troops. The British government has now instructed the British Consul-General to make the necessary arrangements to enable British troops to cooperate if the neutral zone is established. At the same time, the British government has asked the US government to take the same action. The British government also advises the Chinese and Japanese governments to accept the neutral zone plan and immediately instruct their troops to comply. (31st Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to Japanese opinion, the proposal to establish a neutral zone in Shanghai can be supported by the Japanese, but the Japanese believe that it is impossible for Japanese soldiers to withdraw into the concession and for troops from other countries to take over the defense areas originally assigned to Japanese soldiers, because it cannot be supported by national sentiment, especially by local Japanese nationals. (1st Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Military circles here criticized Foreign Minister Yoshizawa for not asking the British, American, and French ambassadors to use their influence to persuade China to withdraw its troops from Shanghai, saying that inviting the intervention of the three countries would only strengthen China's attitude towards Japan and increase China's arrogance. (1st Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>The Sino-Japanese Issue</p>
<h3>Will Have Unexpected Developments</h3>
<p>Yan Huiqing Reports the Shanghai Case to the League of Nations (Geneva) Today, Dr. Yan Huiqing, the chief representative of China, sent a letter to the Council regarding the Japanese soldiers' attack on the Chinese-administered area of Shanghai, raising the issue of demanding compensation from Japan for losses. The letter urged the Council to take immediate and forceful action to stop the encroachment of Japanese soldiers, saying that this action by Japanese soldiers violated the Pact of Paris, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Covenant of the League of Nations. Japanese soldiers also threatened to attack Nanjing. The letter concluded by saying that China reserves the right to demand compensation from Japan for the loss of life and property suffered by Chinese. (31st Kuomintang Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Last night, the Secretariat of the League of Nations received news that unexpected developments are expected in the Sino-Japanese issue. It is heard that the British government intends to formally submit to the Administrative Council the danger of the Far East dispute harming peace, so that the Sino-Japanese issue can be automatically brought into the scope of Article 12 of the Covenant, and the difficulties encountered by the Administrative Council will be relieved as a result, because Article 12 of the Covenant only stipulates various solutions. If this British proposal is indeed true and is submitted to Geneva immediately, the Administrative Council may convene an emergency meeting tomorrow evening to discuss it. Thereafter, the Administrative Council can handle the matter calmly without feeling significant difficulties. (1st Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) Peng Ge, Chairman of the Council of the League of Nations, returned to Paris on official business and will not be able to return here before Thursday. (31st Kuomintang Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Dr. Yan, the Chinese representative attending the League of Nations Administrative Council, sent a telegram from the Chinese government to the Secretariat of the League of Nations today, detailing the bombing of Zhabei by Japanese aircraft, and stating that the bombing of Zhabei has left 5,000 people homeless. The commander of the Japanese fleet in Shanghai, Shiozawa, prevented the Shanghai Public Concession Fire Brigade from going to Zhabei to put out the fire. The Chinese representative also notified the Secretariat of the details of the fighting near Harbin. The Chinese representative denied the Chinese government's intention to declare war on Japan, saying that such an action would be tantamount to suicide and would put China at a disadvantage when it wanted to invoke Article 15 of the Covenant. People here believe that Chiang Kai-shek's recent article advising the people to unite and defend national rights has been misunderstood as a declaration of war. People on the Chinese side in Geneva believe that recent events have promoted the unity of all parties in China and enabled them to stand together on a single front to resist domestic enemies, but this is purely self-defense and not the initiation of war. (31st Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>France Declares its Position</h3>
<p>Respects the Neutrality of the Public Concession</p>
<p>(Paris) A semi-official communique stated that France cannot remain inactive in Shanghai. France has now participated in the deliberations of the Shanghai Foreign Consular Corps and will continue to exert its influence to ease the situation. France is also participating in the consular corps' investigation into the status of Shanghai in accordance with yesterday's resolution of the League of Nations. France has also joined the negotiations in Tokyo between the United Kingdom and the United States yesterday, declaring its respect for the neutrality of the Public Concession. It is believed that the French cruiser Rousseau, currently in Saigon, and some members of the French Far East Forces, will soon go to Shanghai to protect the lives and property of French nationals. Rumors that the French authorities in Shanghai have allowed Japanese troops to pass through the French Concession have been denied by government circles. Evening newspapers all carry news from China, but without much criticism. The Paris Morning Post advised China to negotiate directly with Japan. The newspaper also wrote an article strongly refuting the Washington dispatch of a certain British newspaper, which claimed that the United States believed that France was diplomatically siding with Japan, saying that it was the French representative Peng Ge who insisted on invoking Article 15 of the Covenant yesterday, regardless of Japan's opposition. France also maintains order in the French Concession alone and is willing to assist in the defense of the Public Concession. (31st Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>Soviet Russian Central Political Committee</p>
<h3>Speech Avoids War</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Marov, a member of the Central Political Committee of the Communist Party, delivered a fierce speech at the opening of the Communist Party Congress last night, calling on the entire party to be prepared to defend the Soviet Union against the instigators of war in the Far East, declaring that the White Russian Guards in the Northeast and Paris are openly planning to seize the Far East from the Soviet Union and establish a puppet state of foreigners. He also said that the Soviet Union's foreign policy is purely a policy of peace, which everyone can see. We are completely engaged in peaceful construction. We are doing our best to avoid an attack on the Soviet Union by imperialists. We will do everything we can. He also asked party members to pay attention to the recent Shanghai incident, saying that the line between a peaceful position and a war position is becoming increasingly ambiguous. They not only wage war without declaring it, but also brew war. The feet of those generals are trampling on the national interests of an independent country and a large nation.

<p>(Tokyo) The US Ambassador will visit Yoshizawa again this afternoon to exchange views and dispel misunderstandings. A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated, regarding the US government's note, that the US Consul-General in Shanghai seemed to have received false reports on several important points of the Shanghai case, as the facts reported by him to Washington were different from those obtained in Tokyo. The British Ambassador, Sir Lindley, also visited Yoshizawa again this afternoon and is said to have discussed the Shanghai case. The British Ambassador also inquired about Japan's plan for handling the Shanghai situation. (1st Reuters Telegram)</p>

This is the third note sent by the United Kingdom to Japan since the outbreak of the Shanghai case. The intention of responsible circles in London is to create a neutral zone between the Public Concession and Zhabei, but the original plan is ineffective. (1st Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The formal protest lodged by the British Ambassador was worded similarly to that of the United States, stating that the actions of Japanese soldiers in Shanghai exceeded the necessary scope, endangering the lives of British citizens in the Public Concession. Yoshizawa replied after receiving the protest that the actions of Japanese soldiers had not exceeded the necessary scope and subtly implied that the British protest seemed to be based on false reports of a propagandist nature.

<h3>Plans to Send Army to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Still Claims It Will Not Send</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After consultations between the Minister of the Army, the Minister of the Navy, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs today, it was tentatively decided to send an army division to Shanghai to replace the marines. This proposal must be approved by the Cabinet tomorrow to be effective. The Minister of the Army told news reporters that if an army is sent to Shanghai, it will be withdrawn as soon as the overall situation permits. (1st Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated today that Japan recognizes the seriousness of the situation and welcomes the news that the United Kingdom and the United States are now deploying reinforcements to Shanghai. The Japanese Ministry of the Army, fearing misunderstandings abroad, has not sent an army to Shanghai. Otherwise, at least one division of the army would have already departed at this time. The Japanese army, in view of possible misunderstandings, will probably not dispatch an army unless requested directly by the powers or the authorities of the Shanghai Municipal Council. (1st Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs discussed the Shanghai situation today, saying that unfounded news from Shanghai has created misunderstandings, and that these misunderstandings are mostly due to differences in the interpretation of the terms "land occupation" and "base of operations." The United States accuses Japan of occupying Shanghai, but is the long-term stationing of troops by the United States in Shanghai legal? If it is legal, then why protest when Japan sends sailors ashore for self-defense? The United Kingdom accuses Japan of using the Public Concession as a base of attack, but it should be known that Japanese marines are only working together with various countries to perform the tasks assigned to Japanese soldiers in general defense plans.

<h3>Protesting to Britain and the United States</h3>
<p>Regarding Japanese troops preparing for war in the concessions</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, regarding the Japanese troops attacking our army in Shanghai and even using the public concessions for military preparations, in addition to verbally protesting to the British and American consuls stationed in Beijing, formally lodged a serious protest with the British and American embassies on the evening of the 31st, demanding that they uphold justice and not allow the concessions to be used as a base by the Japanese troops. At the same time, a telegram was sent to the League of Nations representative, Yan, requesting him to immediately make a statement to the Executive Yuan and demand a stop to it. (1st dispatch)</p>
<h3>Luo Wengan's Telegram to the League of Nations</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Foreign Minister Luo sent a telegram to League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond on the morning of the 1st, stating that he had just received news that many newspapers in various countries were saying that China intended to declare war on Japan. This news was completely unfounded. China's actions regarding the Shanghai incident were not a declaration of war against Japan, but merely the adoption of legitimate self-defense, which was a right inherent in China's sovereignty. Japan had repeatedly used a policy of aggression and continued to press forward. China had always faithfully abided by the various obligations under the League of Nations Covenant, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Nine-Power Treaty. However, due to Japan's continued violent attacks on China, the Chinese government had no choice but to take necessary measures for self-defense. If Japan stopped its violence and aggression, the Chinese government would not take hostile actions. (1st dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Destroy Culture</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Cai Yuanpei telegraphed the League of Nations Committee on Intellectual Cooperation, saying, "This time, more than 20 Japanese marines and airplanes have wantonly committed violence in Zhabei, Shanghai, deliberately destroying cultural institutions such as the Commercial Press, the largest publishing house in China, the Oriental Library, and Jinan University, all of which have been almost completely burned down. We, on behalf of the Academia Sinica, National Central University, National Sun Yat-sen University, Tsinghua University, and others, respectfully request your committee to forward a request to the Council of the League of Nations to quickly take effective measures to stop such barbaric acts of the Japanese army that destroy cultural undertakings and human progress."

<h3>Britain Attaches Importance to the Shanghai Incident</h3>
<p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Personnel Work Through the Night</p>
<p>(London) The lights in the Foreign Office burned all night, recalling the situation during the European War, which is sufficient to prove the authorities' importance to the Shanghai incident. Early this morning, the ministry personnel were busy at work again. Prime Minister MacDonald is currently in close consultation with key officials from various ministries and constantly reads the latest reports. So far, no measures have been taken to convene a cabinet meeting. (Reuters dispatch on the 1st)</p>

<h3>Admits to Thuggery by Ronin</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Political circles admit that Japanese ronin in Shanghai have engaged in outrageous behavior, saying that the Japanese authorities in Shanghai are now making every effort to restrain these people and impose severe punishments. It is reported that more than 20 people have been deported back to Japan. This kind of disruptive element is sufficient to increase the severity of the overall situation and hinder the actions of the Japanese authorities. Political circles do not attempt to conceal this. (Reuters dispatch on the 1st)</p>
<h3>British and American Newspapers Comment on the Shanghai Incident</h3>
<p>(London) The London Daily News editorial today stated that the League of Nations was shocked to hear the news of Japanese troops throwing bombs and bombarding Shanghai. None of Japan's friends does not feel that the reputation of civilized countries has been dealt a blow by this. The Times editorial stated that if Japanese politicians cannot restrain the arrogance of their naval and land forces, then world opinion will hold them responsible. It also stated that the key at present is to actively use the opportunity of the temporary ceasefire in Shanghai. The events of the past two days have proven the importance of international action being faster than the League of Nations' actions. The major issue in the relationship between China and Japan will eventually be a League of Nations matter, as both China and Japan are members of the League of Nations. However, if international interests can be protected from the current danger, then why should not the governments of all countries that have a significant relationship with peace in the Far East exert their combined strength in addition to the efforts of the League of Nations? The Liberal Party's news bulletin this morning expressed the opinion that if order is to be restored in Shanghai, it must be done by the League of Nations, as the League of Nations is the final arbiter of international law. The Labour Party's Daily Herald stated that if international acts of robbery are tolerated, the eventual result will be irreparable harm to all countries, including Japan. (Reuters dispatch on the 1st)</p>
<p>News from New York and Tokyo reported that Japan did not object to the League of Nations Council investigating the Shanghai incident, which greatly relieved American newspapers. However, the Tribune Guide stated that Foreign Minister Yoshizawa's statement that the actions of the Japanese in Shanghai were compelled by circumstances could not absolve Major General Shiozawa of the offense of using the public concessions as a base for attacking the Chinese army, as it was not prepared for any possible retreat by the Japanese soldiers, unless they retreated to the public concessions to lure Chinese soldiers to bombard the concessions. The New York Times stated that the League of Nations' investigation could provide Japan with a dignified way out. (Reuters dispatch on the 1st)</p>
<p>Guo Taiqi</p>
<h3>Reports on Policy Toward Japan</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) At the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' memorial week on the morning of the 1st, Political Vice Minister Guo Taiqi reported, briefly stating that the Shanghai incident was considered serious not only by the Chinese people and the government, but also by the international community. Since the incident in Eastern Provinces, followed by the disputes in Tianjin, Qingdao, Fuzhou, and other places, Japanese residents at the ports along the Yangtze River are now withdrawing en masse, becoming increasingly pressing. The Japanese policy has now increasingly revealed that its sole purpose is to use military force to threaten our country's government and force it into a treaty under duress, giving legal recognition to its acts of aggression. The government's relocation of the capital to Luoyang was to avoid the other side's military threats, with the determination to not be humiliated, protect territorial sovereignty and national rights, and maintain the nation's dignity. Currently, the Shanghai incident is being mediated by the British and American consuls-general, with a three-day ceasefire. The Japanese side still needs to wait for instructions from its government, but whether it has sincerity is highly doubtful. We deeply hope to see it reflected in the facts. Our side has made full preparations for legitimate self-defense. However, what is called legitimate self-defense is completely different from the rumors of declaring war on Japan. China has no aggressive ambitions towards Japan, but purely takes self-defense and self-preservation. If the other side oppresses us with military force, then we have no choice but to resist. This is completely different from those who disregard international good faith and engage solely in aggression. In addition to taking legitimate self-defense, the government will still resolutely abide by the Nine-Power Treaty, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the League of Nations Covenant. On the 30th of last month, it sent a note to the signatory countries of the Washington Conference, requesting them to fulfill the obligations stipulated in the treaty and take prompt and effective measures to stop all the Japanese army's violent acts and aggression in Chinese territory, so that peace in the Far East and international good faith can be maintained.</p>

<p>Shanghai Incident</p>
<h3>Ceasefire Deadline Expires Today</h3>
<p>Traffic Was Cut Off Throughout the City Last Night</p>
<p>The Situation is Serious and People are Panicked</p>
<h3>Our Side Persists in Its Claims</h3>
<p>British and American Consuls' Mediation Fails</p>
<p>The previous day, the British and American Consuls-General invited the Chinese and Japanese authorities to the British Consulate to discuss the situation for peace, in order to avoid war. It was recorded in yesterday's newspaper. It was investigated that on that day, the Chinese side claimed that if they wanted to avoid war, the Japanese army should withdraw first, and demanded that all the occupied areas be completely withdrawn immediately. The Japanese side refused. The British and American Consuls suggested a mediation method that the Japanese army should withdraw into the Public Concession and that the encroached road extensions and nearby areas should be temporarily maintained by British and American troops to wait for resolution. They also suggested that the Chinese army should also move back slightly to avoid conflict. Our side insisted on its original demands, so the Japanese Consul requested instructions from his government.</p>
<p>The Garrison Headquarters telegraphed: All newspaper offices are respectfully informed that the Japanese army suddenly provoked our army last night, as reported in previous telegrams. Our army is engaging in appropriate defense and fighting until dusk. The enemy army launched dozens of fierce attacks and bombed the streets with airplanes, causing damage. Our army fought bravely and the enemy soldiers did not succeed. In this battle, four armored vehicles were captured, one enemy plane was shot down, and more than 1,000 enemies were killed. Our army also suffered more than 200 casualties. Following the mediation of the British and American Consuls, a temporary ceasefire has been called and negotiations are underway. Respectfully telegraphed, printed by the Staff Office of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters.</p>
<p>The latest news this morning: at 4:45 this morning, gunshots from machine guns and rifles were continuously heard near the eastern part of North Sichuan Road.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Violates Agreement</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Lodges Deep Night Protest</h3>
<p>Huadong News Agency reports that after the Japanese army violated the agreement and attacked our army at approximately 10 PM the night before, our Army Commander Cai Tingkai immediately notified the municipal government and asked them to inform the British and American Consuls and protest to the Japanese Consul. After receiving the report, the municipal government immediately notified the British and American Consuls to declare the truth that the Japanese army had violated the agreement. On the other hand, Secretary-General Yu went to the Japanese Consulate to lodge a verbal protest, stating that the Japanese army's violation of the agreement should be stopped immediately. Unexpectedly, the Japanese Consulate strongly argued against the municipal government's protest, claiming that it was our army that provoked first, and filed a verbal protest to our side. Secretary-General Yu refuted based on the facts and reasoned rebuttal.</p>
<p>Japanese</p>
<h3>Decide to Take Free Action</h3>
<p>Harassing Everywhere Yesterday</p>
<p>According to an extra edition of a certain Western newspaper, after a meeting with the Japanese naval and army authorities this afternoon (the 1st), the Japanese Consul-General Murai decided to take free action in the Japanese-populated areas of the Public Concession. This proves that the cooperation between the Japanese and the police force of the Public Concession and other foreign defense forces will be minimized. They will act independently in offensive and defensive movements.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, there were no traces of Japanese soldiers north of the Suzhou River, such as on Peng Road and Bazi Road. The Japanese army's defense line was reduced to in front of the Hollywood photo studio, where sandbags and other defensive materials were piled up. There were not many Japanese soldiers stationed there. The huge glass doors and windows of the Hongkou Grand Hotel had been destroyed by artillery shells. There were only sandbags at the intersection of Bazi Road and Qiujiang Road. There was only iron mesh in front of the Xin'ailun Cinema on Haining Road. There were no Japanese soldiers. By about 2 PM, the situation suddenly turned serious. Traffic on all roads north of the Suzhou River was almost completely cut off. There was a Japanese machine gun team stationed at the intersection of North Henan Road and Bazi Road, and there was fierce shooting with the Chinese army on Baoshan Road. A machine gun was set up at the corner of the tram turn at the north end of the Sichuan Road Bridge. One Western police officer and two Chinese police officers on the Sichuan Road Bridge were constantly shaking their heads and waving their hands to prevent pedestrians from heading north. Warehouses in Beijing Road and other places were also moving goods one after another. The situation was extremely serious.</p>
<p>At 3 PM yesterday afternoon, a Japanese warship suddenly sailed from Songkou towards the vicinity of the Dongmen Road of the 16th Pier. In a moment, there were</p>
<h3>Photo of Army Commander Cai and Li Zunyong Inspecting the Battlefield</h3>
<p>More than a dozen Japanese marines disembarked from the ship. When spotted by our garrison troops and police officers, they immediately went to urge them to return to the ship. There was no conflict. At the same time, the iron gates set up at various key points in the Chinese and French concessions of the 16th Pier were closed, and traffic was immediately cut off. The French police were rushing to pile sandbags at each iron gate.</p>
<p>Last night, 300 Japanese marines landed on the Gaoqiao in Pudong. Our army is preparing to resist.</p>
<p>The No. 1 Sub-Bureau of the Labour Sheng Road of the No. 6 District Public Security Bureau in Western Shanghai was attacked by a large group of Japanese ronin and Japanese soldiers the night before. Due to the inferiority in numbers, Inspector Gu led the police to withdraw. Yesterday, District Chief Ren sent an armed box cannon team to drive out the Japanese and regain the sub-bureau. When the Japanese ronin were driven out by our police with force, they fled to the concession one after another. When they arrived at the iron gate and wanted the American troops stationed there to open it, the American troops confiscated all the miscellaneous firearms carried by the ronin and only allowed them to enter empty-handed.</p>
<p>The Zi Lin Daily reported that the Japanese had hung military telephone lines on telephone poles on Peng Road, Wuchang Road, and North Sichuan Road, seemingly concentrated in the Japanese Club on Peng Road, and connected to the Japanese Consulate and the Marine Corps Headquarters on North Sichuan Road, so the transmission of messages was very prompt.</p>
<p>The Da Lu Daily reported that the Japanese naval authorities had asked the French Concession authorities to allow them to send troops to protect the Dongwen College, which was sternly rejected by the Public Works Bureau, saying that the French could protect it themselves and did not need help. The French Consul-General Cangier told the Da Lu Daily on Sunday afternoon that if Japanese soldiers entered or attacked the French Concession, we would repel them with force. The municipal and military authorities have made various preparations, and the strength is sufficient.</p>
<p>The Da Lu Daily reported that at about 4 PM yesterday afternoon, more than 100 Japanese disguised as Chinese were found near Mingyuan. It turned out that the Chinese cooks of Western families were talking to them in Japanese, so they knew. It is feared that these people must have some activity there.</p>
<h3>Special Curfew Last Night</h3>
<p>Traffic Is Cut Off Starting at 10 PM Every Night</p>
<p>(Chinese Area) The Nineteenth Route Army announced a special</p>
<p>curfew last night. The 156th Brigade announced to the residents within its jurisdiction: By order of the Army Commander, a special curfew will be in effect tonight. All residents of this territory should immediately withdraw from the defense line. This order is announced by the 156th Brigade of the 19th Army.</p>

<p>(French Concession) French Concession Police Chief Fevrier issued an emergency announcement on February 1: Regarding the announcement of a curfew, the French Concession authorities have decided to declare a curfew from 10 PM on February 1 and will immediately take necessary measures to maintain peace and order within the concession. All residents of this concession, whether Chinese or foreign, should return home before 10 PM. Anyone still walking outside after 10 PM will be arrested and taken to the police station. This announcement is hereby made for public knowledge.</p>
<h3>British and American Navies Arrive</h3>
<p>Many Marines Transported</p>
<p>(United States) When the incident in Shanghai occurred, the U.S. government immediately instructed Rear Admiral Trainer, commander of the East Asian Navy stationed in Manila, to lead eight destroyers. Trainer took the flagship Houston and set off for Shanghai at the same time. The first batch of four ships arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, namely the USS Edsall (DD-219), USS Parrott (DD-222), USS Paul Jones (DD-230). After arriving at Wusong, they immediately sailed into the Huangpu River and anchored in front of the Mobil Wharf. Another ship, the USS Macdonough (DD-351), did not immediately enter the port upon arrival at Wusong but turned to Nanjing. The ships that arrived first carried a batch of marines, so they were immediately deployed to land upon arrival in Shanghai. As for Admiral Trainer's flagship and the four destroyers that came to Shanghai in the second batch, they will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow. Other naval ships stationed in Luzon have also received orders to prepare to depart, and two military supply ships have already loaded the necessary military supplies and sailed to Shanghai. Among the U.S. ships that arrived in Shanghai yesterday, the first 500 marines arrived.</p>
<p>(United Kingdom) The Great American Evening Post reported that the British naval infantry and field artillery teams stationed in Hong Kong departed this morning (the 1st) to reinforce the British military defenses in the Public Concession of Shanghai. They were transported by the cruiser HMS Berwick. Furthermore, the flagship of the China Fleet, HMS Kent, carrying Admiral Kelly, Commander-in-Chief of the Fleet, sailed to Shanghai ahead of HMS Berwick. The British cruiser HMS Suffolk has arrived in this port and anchored at Jardine Matheson's Pudong Wharf. Subsequently, a team of marines was dispatched to the Shanghai Waterworks Company on Yangshupu Road to replace the guards of the HMS Cornwall. The aforementioned naval and land reinforcements that have arrived or are about to arrive were dispatched to Shanghai by order of the British Admiralty and the War Office at the request of Major General Fulingming, Commander of the British Defense Forces in Shanghai.</p>
<p>It is reported that more than 500 infantry and more than 100 artillery troops dispatched by the United Kingdom from Hong Kong were transported by naval transport ships. According to reliable sources in this port, the British troops will arrive in Shanghai roughly in the afternoon of tomorrow and the morning of the day after tomorrow.</p>
<p>The Zi Lin Daily reported that London telegraphed on the 31st that the Cabinet ordered Hong Kong to dispatch another warship today, carrying a large battalion of infantry and a company of artillery to Shanghai, and ordered the British troops stationed in Shanghai to make preparations to participate in the neutral zone. This is the most important article of the tentative ceasefire agreement.</p>

<h3>Japanese Army Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Army Transported to Shanghai Since the start of the war, the Japanese army has repeatedly suffered defeats. The country's marines have lost their fighting power, so the Japanese side has redeployed troops to Shanghai to fight against our country. Yesterday, the Japanese post liner Terukuni Maru, a European liner, had sailed to Shanghai from Japan. The ship carried a team of marines, whose numbers and serial numbers were kept secret by the Japanese side. It entered the port at 3:30 PM yesterday and berthed at the Wusong Wharf. The soldiers disembarked immediately.</p>
<p>Japanese Warships Leave Shanghai From 6 AM to 9 AM yesterday morning, two destroyers of the 26th Destroyer Squadron, one river defense ship, and one light cruiser suddenly left Shanghai and sailed out of Wusong. Their purpose is unknown. It is said that these Japanese warships are heading to the Yangtze River area to disturb various inland areas of our country.</p>
<p>Military Supplies Transported to Shanghai Since the start of the war, the consumption of military supplies by the Japanese army has been high. It is now heard that the supply ship Mamiya, dispatched by the Japanese Ministry of the Navy, has sailed from Wusong Port to Shanghai fully loaded with food, artillery, rifles, bullets, explosives, etc. It can enter the port this morning for use by the Japanese troops in Shanghai. In addition, the destroyer Asakaze, carrying many military vehicles, can also enter the port this afternoon.</p>
<h3>Japanese Destroy Everywhere</h3>

The local defense group received a warning message before 12 AM that night and ordered all residents to move to the plains. Currently, there are more than 100 Japanese soldiers on the roof of the Toyota Textile Mill, which is operated by the Japanese, and they often fire guns at night to show off their power. Our country also has stationed troops. After several sections of the Fanwangdu railway tracks were demolished by Japanese soldiers, they have not yet been repaired.</p>
<p>Nanxiang At 3 PM on the 31st, Japanese aircraft dropped several bombs in Nanxiang, all near the runway. The tracks were not destroyed.</p>
<h3>Generals</h3>
<h3>Send Telegrams of Condolence to Jiang and Cai</h3>
<p>Liu Zhi and Others Are Willing to Be a Backup</p>
<p>After the soldiers of the Nineteenth Route Army vowed to resist Japan to the death and repelled the Japanese army in Zhabei, generals from all sides were extremely excited upon hearing the news. Liu Zhi, Chen Jicheng, and others sent telegrams to the army's commander-in-chief Jiang Guangnai, division commander Cai Tingkai, and garrison commander Dai Ji to express their condolences and willingness to be a backup. The telegrams are recorded on the left.</p>
<p>Liu Zhi Telegraphed The Japanese are strong, overbearing, and threatening. They regard our country as having no one left and do whatever they want. Repeated warnings have been received, and my hair stands on end and my eyes crack. This time, you brothers are making the greatest determination to engage in legitimate resistance. Your devotion and blood allegiance are admired by all. I hope that you will be unyielding and fight to the end, quell the ferocity of the倭寇and show the country's might to the world. Protecting the race and revitalizing the country is at stake. We brothers are bound by the same hatred and vow to be your backing. We have prepared everything and are waiting for orders. Is the force at the front adequate? What is the situation? Please let me know immediately and look forward to good news to comfort my distant thoughts. Brother Liu Zhi, 30th.</p>
<p>Chen Jicheng Telegraphed The violence of Japan's occupation of our Northeast has shocked the whole country. Recently, marines were sent to Shanghai to kill, set fire, and act recklessly. On the night of the 28th of this month, they openly violated our defense line and provoked us, committing a great outrage against the world. If this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated? You brothers are acting within your duty to make a heroic resistance, kill the enemy, and defend the country. You are infinitely admirable. I hope that you will uphold the spirit of never giving up and have the ambition to die for the country. Expel all Japanese troops onto ships and urgently order them to leave our territory. All unreasonable demands will be rejected. We soldiers cannot bear to sit idly by. I will put on my armor and wield my weapon to be your backing. The telegram is urgent and I am restless in my thoughts. Brother Chen Jicheng, 30th.</p>

I respectfully ask you to work hard and fight hard. I respectfully reply by telegram. Brother Zhang Lisheng, bowing, 30th.</p>
<p>Lou Jingyue Telegraphed The Japanese troops' invasion of Shanghai has aroused deep anger. At this time of national crisis, when the situation is critical, your unit has taken on the responsibility of defending the country and protecting the people, initiating the first voice of resisting aggression and saving the country. Your blood and flesh are fighting on all sides, and your defense is just. All comrades in arms admire you immensely. We share the same hatred and are determined to be united. I hope you will send me clear instructions. Lou Jingyue, Commander of the 87th Division of the Army, bowing, 30th.</p>
<p>Jiang Fusheng Telegraphed The Japanese are relying on violence to provoke trouble in Shanghai. The news has spread and is truly outrageous. Since the loss of the Northeast, morale has been low. You are putting on your armor and wielding your weapons to engage in legitimate defense, which adds to the glory of our comrades in arms and preserves the personality of our people. I have already telegraphed my superiors, expressing my willingness to lead my troops to fight alongside you, vowing to be your backup without hesitation. The telegram is full of grief and anger, and I don't know what to say. Jiang Fusheng, Commander of the 83rd Division of the Army.</p>

<h3>War Zone Inspection Report</h3>
<p>Soldiers Display Spirited Patriotism</p>
<p>Enemy's Stubborn Resistance Cannot Prevail</p>
<p>Since the evening of the 28th of last month, Japanese troops, using armored vehicles and artillery vehicles to shield marines and plainclothes units, suddenly attacked our military defense lines in the Chinese-controlled area. Our troops, in order to protect the land and defend the people, made a legitimate resistance. On the evenings of the 28th and 29th, large Japanese units launched several attacks on the Chinese-controlled area but were repelled by our 19th Route Army. The enemy suffered heavy losses, and our army achieved a great victory. However, when the Japanese troops retreated in defeat, they set fire to civilian houses and dropped bombs from airplanes, causing unspeakable damage to the local area. In order to understand the actual situation of this battle and the local damage in detail, our newspaper reporter, at the invitation of our military authorities, went to the forefront of Zhabei yesterday morning to conduct an on-the-spot inspection. When the reporter was inspecting the front line, enemy troops frequently fired machine guns, which seemed very dangerous. However, the defensive works built by our army were very solid, and with the guidance of Vice Commander Tan Qixiu of the 78th Division and Battalion Commander Wu, we remained safe and sound. Now, the reporter will record the situation witnessed, selecting what can be published and describing it separately as follows:</p>
<p>Congestion Outside the Security Line After meeting with Vice Division Commander Tan, at 11:00 AM, we took a car from Zhongshan Road, proceeded northeast along Jiaotong Road, and turned south at Datong Road. However, pedestrians and rickshaws were extremely congested, and although there were police officers directing traffic, it was impossible for the car to pass. We had to retreat to Jiaotong Road, head east, go straight to Wangjiazhai, and then to Zhongxing Road. At the eastern end of the Zhongxing Grand Theater, there were our military's defensive works. After getting out of the car, Division Commander Tan immediately said to the reporter, "The front is a restricted area, and you must be careful of enemy stray bullets if you proceed." He asked if I wanted to proceed, and I replied that I very much wanted to see it. Then, Division Commander Tan and the company commander defending the area led the way.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Firing Machine Guns Frequently After we crossed the defense line, we turned south on Baochang Road. Passing the entrance of Lianxi Lane, there was a child's corpse that no one had buried, which was heartbreaking to see. At the end of Baochang Road is Baoshan Road. Our army had built a solid defense line there. Outside this defense line is Baoshan Road. All the houses on the east side of Baoshan Road, from the Commercial Press to Qiujiang Road, were reduced to scorched earth. The area in front of this was our most advanced defense line. According to a certain transport officer, the enemy was hiding in buildings in the Dade Lane and the eastern section of Qiujiang Road, east of the Songhu Railway, constantly firing machine guns at us. As he spoke, we were slowly advancing south on Baoshan Road. As we were about to reach the intersection of Hongxing Road, gunfire suddenly erupted from the east, and the places where bullets landed were clearly visible. The company commander also said, "They may have already spotted us." We quickly retreated north to the front of the Commercial Press. The tall buildings of the past are now only the remaining scorched walls and ruins. We originally intended to go north again on Baoshan Road, but we heard dense gunfire from the Tian Tong An area in the north. At the same time, the Oriental Library, opposite the Commercial Press General Factory, was burning fiercely. Therefore, at the suggestion of Division Commander Tan, we turned into Baotong Road and then turned north on Zhongxing Road into Baoxing Road. Because the Tian Tong An station was in front, and enemy troops had also set up machine guns on the east side to fire, we crouched down inside the defense line and observed for about 20 minutes. We only heard gunfire coming from the northeast, but we did not see the enemy's figures. Our soldiers were all guarding inside the defense line and did not retaliate. I asked Division Commander Tan, "Why don't our troops retaliate?" Division Commander Tan replied, "Our side respects the three-day truce agreement, so Commander Cai has ordered a temporary cessation of firing." I also asked, "If the enemy troops charge, will we still not fire?" Division Commander Tan replied, "If the enemy troops charge, of course we will fire."</p>
<p>Serious Situation on Qingyun Road We returned from Tian Tong An Road to Yanjiage Road, heading in a northeast direction. We happened to meet Battalion Commander Wu of the Second Battalion, who reported the front line situation to Division Commander Tan. We also inspected the defense line next to the small river in the northern section of Tian Tong An Road for more than ten minutes. Division Commander Tan, being busy with military affairs, could not stay for long, so he introduced Battalion Commander Wu to guide us to inspect the front line in the Qingyun Road and Tongji Road area. Battalion Commander Wu led us to the junction of Yanjiage Road and Tongji Road. The north end is Jiangwan Road. When we reached the southern end of the small wooden bridge, enemy machine gunfire erupted fiercely, and the nearby walls were covered with bullet marks. Battalion Commander Wu instructed us to wait in the civilian houses on the south end of the bridge while he went to the front line to observe the enemy's situation before deciding whether to proceed. Wu left, crossed the bridge to the front line, and returned about 19 minutes later, leading us to look inside the second defense line after crossing the bridge. The enemy troops were still firing frequently, but our soldiers ignored them and did not see any other enemy action. Wu said that this place was only 30 meters away from the enemy's skirmish line, so the situation here was the most serious. Returning to the south side of the bridge, he led us upstairs again. The Tian Tong An station was right in front of us, and the enemy's machine guns were set up on the roof on the east side of the railway. The Japanese Marine Corps headquarters was also clearly visible. Two Japanese soldiers guarding the machine guns were constantly looking at us with binoculars. Going downstairs along the small river to Qingyun Road, in front of the Guangming Glass Factory, there were seven or eight coffins of fallen soldiers. The Qingyun Bridge to the north had already been burned down, and the south side of the bridge was our army's defense line. The west side, along the railway to Jiangwan Road, was also within our army's defense line. By the time we reached here, it was already after 2:00 PM, so we said goodbye to Battalion Commander Wu, expressing our congratulations on the victory, and he arranged for a guard to escort us outside the security line, where we boarded a car and returned to the hotel.</p>
<p>Our Army's Morale is Doubled The soldiers of our army stationed on the front line have been resisting the enemy army for four days and nights. Not only do they show no signs of懈怠, but they are all full of spirit. All the lower-level officers are bravely and resolutely directing everything on the battlefield. They are warm and caring to the people in the rear, leaving nothing to be desired. Therefore, there is no panic among the people coming and going in all places outside the security line.</p>
<p>Oriental Library on Fire When the reporter arrived at Zhongxing Road at 11:00 AM, he saw that the Oriental Library was on fire. Asking the soldiers, they said that there was a coal store near the library. Because the remaining fire from the burning of the general factory had not been extinguished, the coal store suddenly caught fire around 7:00 AM this morning (the 1st), and it was impossible to put it out, which led to the spread of the fire to the Oriental Library. It was not until after 1:00 PM that a fire truck from the Zhabei Fire Brigade arrived to put out the fire. It was not until after 2:00 PM that the fire was extinguished, and the neighboring civilian houses were preserved.</p>
<p>Police Brigade's Battle Achievements The Sixth Squadron of the Police Brigade of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, led by squad leader Hu Mingping and more than ten police officers, was responsible for fighting the enemy at the intersection of Tian Tong An Road and Tongji Road on the night of the 28th of last month at 11:05 PM. They charged several times, injuring several police officers. At that time, they destroyed two enemy armored vehicles. That night, three Japanese planes dropped bombs from the air, injuring the legs of police officers, but there was no major problem. The next day (the 29th) at 1:00 PM, they were fortunate to receive machine gun reinforcements from the 19th Route Army, so the Japanese soldiers could not break through our position. The names of the eight injured police officers are as follows: Pang Xiangwu, Zhang Tingdong, Zhang Jiujiang, Guo Jingyuan, Liu Renxuan, Zhao YuSan, Zhou Dequan, and Tan Hanting. Among them, police officers Liu and Zhao were the most seriously injured.</p>

<h3>Two Failed General Attacks by Japanese Troops</h3>
<p>Talk from Battalion Commander Wu Kangjian</p>
<p>Enemy Troops Suffered a Thousand Casualties</p>
<p>Our Side Lost Only Two Hundred</p>
<p>Proceeded to the Battlefield Immediately After the Wedding Ceremony</p>
<p>Wu Kangjian, Battalion Commander of the Second Battalion of the Sixth Regiment of the 78th Division of the 19th Route Army, led the reporter to inspect the front line yesterday afternoon. When we rested at the military headquarters, I inquired about the actual situation of this battle. He described it in detail as follows. Battalion Commander Wu said that our army fought the Japanese army this time with only three battalions of troops, and the defense line extended from north of the North Station to Jiangwan Road. The Japanese army thought that there was no ability to resist, so at 11:30 PM on the 28th, they launched a large number of marines and plainclothes units, using armored artillery vehicles to shield them, and attacked our army's defense line in four routes. The first route was at the North Railway Station, the second route was at Qiujiang Road, the third route was at Yokohama Bridge Tian Tong An, and the fourth route was at Qingyun Road and Hongji Road. Each route had three or four armored vehicles, and there were about three or four hundred marines and plainclothes units. Those who attacked our Second Battalion's defense line on the evening of the 28th launched their attacks from Hongji Road toward Qingyun Road, around 11:15 PM. There was a police brigade defending the east end of that location. Our battalion learned that the Japanese army had attacked us, and heard that the police brigade at the east end was already resisting. Our battalion immediately moved to the defense line along Tian Tong An Road, Yanjiage Road, and Qingyun Road to provide assistance. Just as our army arrived on the south bank of the small river, the enemy launched a large-scale attack on Qingyun Road. Our army immediately dispersed to fight back. The enemy's formation had armored vehicles in front, firing machine guns. Plainclothes units were on the left and right sides of the armored vehicles, and the marines closely followed behind the armored vehicles. When our army fought back, the plainclothes units immediately dispersed and climbed to the upper floors of civilian houses on both sides, attacking us. At that time, the enemy's armored vehicles actually broke through the wooden bridge and reached the south bank of Qingyun Road. Our army also climbed to the upper floors and used hand grenades to attack, and the enemy was finally unable to hold on and retreated north across the bridge. When the enemy retreated, our army used machine guns to strafe, killing more than one hundred enemy troops, and burned down the wooden bridge. After that, we fought each other across the river until about 7:00 AM on the 29th, when the enemy retreated in a sorry state. Around 6:00 PM on the evening of the 29th, the enemy army launched another large-scale attack. Our army tried its best to resist, and after fierce fighting until about 6:00 AM on the 30th, the enemy army retreated again. Since the 30th, the enemy army has repeatedly launched sneak attacks, but the number of people has been no more than three or five, or seven or eight. Sometimes they would fire a few shots randomly in civilian houses, and as soon as our army fought back, they would flee. The Japanese army launched two charges on the evenings of the 28th and 29th, and after two nights of fierce fighting, they were repelled by our army. In this battle, the enemy army suffered about four or five hundred casualties, and our soldiers suffered sixty or seventy casualties, and Platoon Leader Jiang Jin was killed, and Platoon Leader Guo Cai was wounded. The enemy's dead soldiers were all taken away in freight cars. When they came to collect them, they would first use armored vehicles to show off, and then transport the dead soldiers away. According to reports, the Japanese army attacked in four routes this time, and our army responded to the defense at any time. In total, the Japanese army suffered one thousand several hundred deaths. Our army's total deaths and injuries amounted to only two hundred. Also, our army's morale is very strong. No matter how strong the Japanese army is, it will never be able to seize a step of our army's front line. At this point, the reporter said goodbye. Before leaving, Mr. Wu smiled and asked the reporter if he could deliver a letter on his behalf. The reporter agreed. Mr. Wu then said that he had just been married on January 24th, but after the wedding ceremony, he returned to the defense because his team was in Zhabei and was in a state of crisis. He has not yet returned to visit. He asked that news of his safety be delivered to ease their worries. He provided a name card, on which was written "So-and-so, don't worry, I am very safe" and his address. The reporter was moved by Mr. Wu's selflessness and his sincere love for both the country and his family, so he immediately delivered the message to keep the promise.</p>
<h3>Conversation Between Two Division Commanders</h3>
<p>Negotiation Process</p>
<p>Information from All Sides</p>
<p>Division Commander Qu Talks New Times Press reporter visited Division Commander Qu Shounian of the 78th Division yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM at the headquarters to ask for details about his participation in the Anglo-American mediation process. He said that since the Japanese army had attempted to occupy Zhabei, our army had resisted with all its might, resulting in a major defeat for the Japanese army. Consuls from the United Kingdom and the United States, in order to avoid war, specifically invited both China and Japan to engage in mediation. We believe that war is unavoidable. Since the United Kingdom and the United States are engaged in mediation, we naturally express our support. Therefore, there was a mediation once before, where both sides would first cease fire. However, the Japanese army violated the agreement and continued to fire and attack. In order to avoid the escalation of the war, the British and American consuls again invited both China and Japan to conduct mediation yesterday (31st) at the British consulate. Consuls from the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and Italy, the British and American defense forces commander, Japanese Commander Kamizawa and Consul General Murai attended. In addition to Mayor Wu, Commander Cai sent me to attend. During the meeting, I severely questioned the Japanese side about their violation of the agreement and demanded that the Japanese army first withdraw to the concession line and reply within three hours. The Japanese side made evasive defenses regarding the challenge and said that they needed to consult the government within two weeks regarding the withdrawal of troops to the concession line. At that time, the mediation was temporarily broken. Then, the British and American consuls proposed a compromise solution, with a deadline of three days for the Japanese consul to consult the government about the withdrawal of troops. During these three days, both sides would cease fire and not fire to attack. This was agreed to by both China and Japan and the meeting was adjourned. This is the process of my participation in the mediation. As for compensation and apologies, because they do not fall within the scope of military affairs, they will be submitted by the government for negotiation. Since the United Kingdom and the United States have mediated in this way, we should respect the agreement, but the Japanese side is cunning and there is no doubt that they have a plan. In order to prevent the Japanese from using a delaying tactic, our army has made considerable preparations in order to respond to any eventuality.</p>
<p>Vice Division Commander Tan Yesterday, a reporter from New Times Press met with Vice Division Commander Tan Qixiu of the 78th Division and asked about the truth of the report that Japanese planes dropped bombs in Zhenru on the 31st and our army engaged in fierce fighting and shot down two Japanese planes. He replied that it was not true. As for the Liuhang area, according to reports, there are four warships in the local exit, and our army used sea searchlights to observe, but due to the heavy fog, it is not clear which country's warships they are. However, our army has deployed a tight defense in Liuhang to ensure that there is no danger. There are occasional reports from Wusong, which are still peaceful.</p>
<h3>Statement of the 19th Route Army</h3>
<p>Notice from the Headquarters of the 19th Army: Our army is responsible for defending the land and resisting Japanese aggression. Various civilian groups are enthusiastically helping us, for which we are extremely grateful. Our army should contact and assist all organizations that resist Japan and save the country, and work separately to achieve the effect of saving the country. However, our army has never sent anyone to establish so-called anti-Japanese volunteer teams or other organizations in the name of our army. We are afraid that there may be false pretenses, so we hereby attach a statement to avoid misunderstandings. This notice is given.</p>
<h3>Various Sectors Express Their Views on the Situation</h3>
<p>Telegram from Anti-Japanese Associations of Various Universities to the people of the whole country: The people of the whole country are aware that the atrocities of Japan in trampling on the three northeastern provinces have not ceased, and they are openly invading the south. Since January 28, all the situations in which the Japanese bandits have been rampant and our army has resisted have been detailed in newspapers, and there is no need to repeat them. We believe that the Japanese bandits have disregarded public law and reason to such an extent that they not only disregard our country, but also disregard the world. We dare not say whether the world will still allow public law and reason to exist, but whether our country can truly stand in the world depends entirely on the efforts of all the people of the Republic of China. In the past, Emperor Yongle of the Ming Dynasty said that "I am not the king of a fallen country." Are our people today willing to be the people of a fallen country? It is still up to the self-determination of our people. We are in pain and think about it, and after discussing it again and again, we dare to make a few decisions based on the recent environment, and respectfully inform the people of the country. (1) This time, our 19th Route Army, based on its military duty to defend the country, overcame all difficulties to resolve to die, and was able to fully demonstrate its spirit and ability to resist. The world has paid attention, giving our national history and future a major impact. It cannot be regarded as a Shanghai corner relationship. Our people should unanimously recognize this point, sacrifice everything, and provide assistance. (2) Since the government has declared that it will move to Luoyang to show its determination not to be coerced by violence, it should do its best to provide assistance to the Shanghai war. It is better to move to Luoyang without fear, and to defend the country without relying on empty words. If this is the case, our people will support it, otherwise, there will still be no way to shirk the responsibility of the party's misguidance of the country. Our people should unanimously urge and pay attention to it. (3) All military divisions and brigades in the country should rise up together and go to various places invaded by the Japanese bandits, join the resistance, and wash away the shame of being used as private tools in the past. If the army does so, our people should unanimously help them. (4) The commitments made by the Shanghai Municipal Government this time have not been effective for the enemy, and our people vow not to recognize them. All economic boycotts and all other anti-Japanese actions in Shanghai and other places should be upheld to the end and not succumbed to violence. Hereby announce, the telegram is filled with indignation. Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of Shanghai Universities.</p>
<p>Wusong Organizes National Crisis Association The Wusong Chamber of Commerce, considering that the troops stationed in Songdi need the articles and food used for defense projects, felt that there was a lack of them, so it convened leaders of all businesses in the town at 7:00 PM the night before (31st) for an emergency meeting. More than 100 people, including Shi Yunjie, Tang Zan Zhi, Xu Wei, Zhuang Senlin, and Yang Yuankang, attended. Yang Yuankang chaired the meeting and reported the purpose of the meeting. After discussion by the public, the National Crisis Association was organized first in order to raise funds and start work. The resolution of important cases: (1) The name was set as the Wusong National Crisis Provisional Association. (2) Five members were elected on the spot: Shi Yunjie, Shen Yiqiu, Zhang Yuchi, Zhuang Senlin, and Yang Yuankang. (3) Regarding the issue of raising temporary funds, one month's rent will be collected first, with half from the tenant and half from the landlord. The method of collecting will be based on the actual amount of the house donation. (4) Send telegrams to all sectors to ask for assistance. (5) Set up a temporary office in Shanghai to facilitate contact.</p>
<p>Proposals for Joint Meetings of Various Groups for National Salvation The Shanghai Joint Association of Various Groups for National Salvation held its second board meeting at 8:00 PM the night before at the Zhongshe on Weihaiwei Road. Chu Huiseng chaired the meeting, and the resolutions were as follows: (1) Telegram to Zhang Xueliang to unite against foreign aggression. (2) Please ask the silver and money industries to open the market immediately, and set a limit of no more than 500 yuan per household per week (factories and companies are not subject to this limit for the purpose of paying salaries to personnel and employees). (3) Letter to Mr. Zhu Ziqiao and various hometown associations to add more people's shelters. (4) Letter to the rice industry association and government offices to ask them to find ways to stop the soaring rice prices and restore traffic to facilitate the source. (5) Letter to the tobacco exchange industry association to ask them to crack down on hoarding and price suppression by exchange shops. (6) Telegram to the League of Nations representative Yan, asking the League of Nations to request the implementation of Article 16 of the League of Nations membership charter. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<p>Guangdong Fellow Villagers Telegraphing to Go to the National Crisis Huangdong Fellow Villagers' Comfort Association sent a telegram to all compatriots in the country yesterday to go to the national crisis together. The book says that since the Northeast Incident, Japan has used force to invade, occupy our land, trample on our people, and oppress our government. Our compatriots throughout the country have looked up to the Central Government, respected the Washington Treaty, believed in the League of Nations, and endured suffering with tears in their eyes in order to resolve it peacefully. They have been unwilling to take any actions that cross the line, but Japan has dealt with our Central Government with the army, making advances and pressing on. It has disturbed our Tianjin, spied on our Rehe, and provoked several times in Hankou and Fuzhou, almost causing disaster. Recently, it has exhausted its violence to invade our Shanghai. Shanghai is the central place of the world's economy and the area where the essence of our country is gathered. Japan has ignored this and sent 30 warships and 4,500 marines, mixed with ronin and plainclothes soldiers, to attack our Zhabei from the concession on January 29 of this year. They used the most violent artillery and machine guns to bombard the Chinese-controlled area that is adjacent to the concession, and used more than a dozen airplanes to randomly throw bombs and set fire to destroy thousands of our houses, which are still burning. Thousands of our compatriots have been killed and injured, and the tragic situation is unbearable to witness. Fortunately, our 19th Route Army, with the duty of defending the territory, used the strategy of self-defense to carry out considerable resistance, and won victories in two days and nights of fierce fighting with the invading Japanese troops, greatly thwarting their fierce attacks. They are currently in fierce fighting. However, Japan has been deliberately planning to conquer us by force, and China will never be willing to stop with this defeat. Judging from the continuous arrival of the domestic fleet in Japan and the deployment and defense of the fleet stationed in the Yangtze River area, we can see that it is trying to retaliate and will have a large-scale action, and there is already a situation of expanding the war zone. Now, our Central Government has moved to Luoyang and has made a declaration that it will not be coerced by violence. Comrade Chiang Kai-shek has sent telegrams to all armies to be ready to go to war. From then on, the Central Government's strategy towards Japan has changed from the previous non-resistance policy to stopping and actively resisting. At this time when the country is about to perish, there is a glimmer of dawn, which is indeed a major turning point in the midst of survival and danger. Our compatriots throughout the country have been subjected to the persecution of Japan's military force for a long time. In accordance with the government's policy of seeking perfection, they have been unable to express their feelings. Now that the government has issued a decisive declaration, all armies are ready to resist to the death, and our 19th Route Army has used its loyal and brave self-defense strategy to inflict a heavy blow on the invasion of the Japanese troops. This is the time for all compatriots in the country to rise up and make a concerted effort to resist and express their long-suppressed aspirations. With our 470 million compatriots, except for the elderly and weak, one-quarter of them can join the defense work. The strong can join the army with spears, the weak can join the army with pens, the poor can devote themselves to serving the country, and the rich can destroy their families to help the country. The former falls, and the latter continues. Each person fulfills his duty to be responsible for the rise and fall of the country, and fights to the death with the Japanese bandits, with whom we swear not to live under the same sky. We know that although the Japanese army is strong and its weapons are sophisticated, it may not be able to match the determination of our people. Recovering our lost land and restoring our rivers and mountains is the responsibility of the government, the generals, and all our compatriots. The division between survival and extinction depends on this battle. Time cannot be lost, and loss cannot be recovered. Let our compatriots encourage each other. Publicly叩by Guangdong Fellow Villagers' Comfort Association.</p>
<p>Letter from the Lawyers Association to the Consuls and the Bureau of Public Works</p>
<h3>Letter from the Consuls and the Bureau of Public Works</h3>
<p>Please Adopt Effective Methods in the Shortest Possible Time</p>
<p>So That the Concession Does Not Allow the Presence of Armed Forces Hostile to Our Country</p>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association sent a letter to the leading consuls and the Bureau of Public Works of the Shanghai Public Concession yesterday, saying: "We are writing to inform you that the Japanese troops have come to Shanghai with the intention of oppressing our country. However, the Shanghai Consular Corps and the Bureau of Public Works of the Public Concession have actually designated the Hongkou area as the defense area for the Japanese troops, which has made a big mistake and made the Public Concession lose its spirit of neutrality. The Japanese troops have used this defense area as a base for attacking our country's territory, and the Hongkou area has completely lost its historical position as part of the Public Concession. Our defending generals and soldiers are exercising their legitimate</p>
<h3>Commander Cai and Others Inspect the Battlefield (Photo by Li ZunYong)</h3>
<p>powers and are naturally entitled to take such measures as they deem necessary against the military source of aggression against us. The Association and all the citizens are willing to continue and enhance the friendly spirit with the Public Concession authorities and earnestly hope that the Public Concession authorities will adopt effective methods in the shortest possible time to reject this danger so that the entire Public Concession area does not allow the presence of armed forces hostile to our country. This is not only the prosperity of the Public Concession, but also the foundation for the permanent friendship between Chinese and foreign people. The joint meeting of the Association's executive supervisors unanimously resolved to recommend Wu Jingxiong and Chen Tingrui, two members, to express this intention separately to the British and American consuls stationed in Shanghai and the persons in charge of the Bureau of Public Works." It was resolved in the case, hereby send this letter, respectfully hope to check and implement, and please see the reply for happiness. This letter is addressed to the leading consuls of the Shanghai Public Concession, the standing committee members of the Shanghai Lawyers Association, Li Shirui, Lu Shaozong, Tan Yigong, etc., 二一·二·一. Another letter to the Bureau of Public Works and members Wu Jingxiong and Chen Tingrui is roughly the same, omitted.</p>
<h3>Talks of the National Crisis Conference Members in This City</h3>
<p>Meeting at the Zhongshe Today at Noon</p>
<p>Since the government announced the list of members for the National Crisis Conference, the members appointed from Tianjin and other places have held meetings to discuss the attitude they should adopt and their common positions. This city has the largest number of appointed members. In view of the dangerous situation caused by the Shanghai Incident, some of the appointed members, including Zhang Yaozeng, Zhao Zhengping, Wang Zaoshi, Wen Zongyao, Peng Yunyi, Chu Fucheng, Chen Jintao, Chen Qitian, Liu Tianyu, Zuo Shunsheng, Zhang Binglin, Feng Shaoshan, Hu Shuhua, Huang Huopei, Zhao Shuyong, Sun Hongyi, Li Huang, Yu Jiaju, and others, believe it is necessary to jointly find ways for relief. They have specifically scheduled a lunch meeting at the Zhongshe on Weihaiwei Road at twelve noon today to exchange views and discuss national affairs together. The initiators are concerned that the notification may not be complete and sincerely hope that all appointed members in this city will attend the University Volunteer Army at that time.</p>
<h3>Emergency Mobilization Order</h3>
<p>The Shanghai University Volunteer Army Headquarters, considering the serious situation, issued an emergency mobilization order yesterday, stating that all registered volunteer soldiers in this city should gather at the Xiaoximen Juvenile Propaganda Corps at 1:00 PM today (the 2nd) to be organized and sent to the front lines. This order is urgent.</p>
<h3>Justified Argument Published in American Newspaper</h3>
<p>Restore the Neutral Nature of the Concessions</p>
<p>The Armed Japanese Should Be Expelled</p>
<p>The editorial of the Da Mei Evening News states that the Japanese troops and those carrying guns have not only lost their effectiveness in the Shanghai defense plan, but have also lost their right to reside in the Public Concession. Therefore, our concern for Japan's position today is no different from the Japanese concern for our rights, property, and lives. Japan's position in name is that it has not severed friendship with China and is cooperating with other countries to defend the Concession, but in fact, Japan is at war with China and is using the neutral area of the Public Concession as its base of operations in an extremely improper manner. The Japanese not only harm the position of the Public Concession in other countries with this kind of behavior, but also usurp police power from the Concession authorities in a manner that we consider extremely inappropriate, and expand the area of its exercise, reaching positions that others had never anticipated and abusing this power to engage in various behaviors such as arson and slaughter of detainees. Therefore, the Public Concession authorities should immediately publicly state that they have no relationship with this kind of excessive behavior, and make it clear to the public that other countries and their expatriates have not participated in any war against China. Furthermore, the neutral position of the Public Concession should be reaffirmed. It is a place where foreigners can reside safely and cannot be used as a base of operations. When this neutral nature has been violated, to restore it, the following should be immediately demanded: (1) All armed Japanese troops should be withdrawn outside the Concession, or at least all except those necessary to defend the Concession should be removed. The Concession police should be able to exercise their powers again. (2) The armed Japanese plainclothes teams should be disarmed. They have proven themselves to be a ferocious, brutal, and irresponsible group. (3) No more armed Japanese troops should land within the Concession. The Japanese have made a big mistake, and the tragic record cannot be erased. All we can do today is make the public understand that Japan is acting alone. Of course, Japanese people who do not participate in the war can stay within the Concession and be protected by the Concession authorities and the troops of various countries, together with the Chinese people. But to those armed Japanese who have betrayed their trust and used the Concession as a base of operations, we can only say "Get out!"</p>
<h3>The Volunteer Armies Rise Up</h3>
<p>Retired Soldiers The Retired Soldiers of the Republic of China Anti-Japanese National Salvation Volunteer Army has been quite brave since the start of the battle. Recently, due to the state of truce, there have been no intense battles. The night before last (the 31st) after 10:00 PM, they encountered a small number of Japanese plainclothes soldiers on Qingyun Road, which led to a conflict. Soldier Wang Ziqing was injured. The Japanese plainclothes soldiers retreated immediately upon seeing the defenses. The army headquarters has now moved to Tanzi Bridge in Zhabei.</p>
<p>Feng Yong Feng Yong led the Feng Yong University Student Volunteer Army to Shanghai to support the war. Yesterday, he sent a telegram to the 19th Route Army in Beiping, saying, "To Commander-in-Chief Chiang, Division Commander Cai, Commander Dai, and comrades of the Volunteer Army Headquarters, I am pleased to report that I will lead the students of our school directly to the Shanghai beach today to shed blood and eliminate the Japanese bandits. Respectfully, Feng Yong bows."</p>
<p>Universities In addition to joining our army at any time to undertake rear defense duties, the volunteer armies of various universities in this city began to specifically recruit rescue team members from the first of this month. In just one day, hundreds of people from all walks of life in this city went to register.</p>
<p>Secondary Schools The United Association of Anti-Japanese National Salvation Students of Secondary Schools is currently preparing the organization of volunteer armies and rescue teams to serve on the battlefield. Any ambitious young person can go and participate. Registration started the day before yesterday, and the formation and departure will be organized soon. The registration office is located at No. 15 Jiping Lane, Ximen, the office of the association.</p>
<p>City League The Shanghai Citizens United Association National Salvation Volunteer Army Committee issued an emergency mobilization order yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, ordering the volunteer armies of each branch to gather and depart at 9:00 AM today to carry out work on the front lines. The volunteer armies of the fifth, sixth, and seventh branches have been working in the Zhabei area in the past few days with good results. They are now determined to fight to the death with the violent Japanese. The City League and its branches are enthusiastically cooperating with the rear liaison matters to fulfill their duties.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Wu Yue and others, former members of the Northern Expeditionary Army, organized the Overseas Chinese National Salvation Volunteer Army. Yesterday, they sent a telegram, stating, "Since the national crisis occurred, four months have passed. The League of Nations has lost its effectiveness, and the covenants are like waste paper. The powerful enemy is gaining ground and nibbling away our territory. Disaster is imminent. Our great nation with thousands of years of history is about to fall to foreign rule and never recover. Thinking of this, we feel extreme pain. Wu Yue and others have experienced military life and have gone through hundreds of battles. They have also participated in the Renzi Campaign with Commander-in-Chief Yao Yuping. After the matter was settled, they returned to the fields and have long been generously provided for by overseas Chinese. They have always thought of repaying them, but they deeply regret that they have not had the opportunity. On December 8th of last year, after reading a newspaper report stating that Xie Fuchu, the president of the Overseas Chinese Industrial Promotion Association, requested the government to donate funds and provide weapons to organize the Overseas Chinese National Salvation Volunteer Army to be a support for the government and jointly avenge the national humiliation, Wu Yue and others immediately recruited old troops and vowed to serve the country and share the patriotic enthusiasm of overseas Chinese. They are now ready to be organized and have established a general headquarters at No. 91 Da Wu Road, Ximen. They will immediately pack their bags and join the front lines to resist the violent Japanese and begin to concentrate. They have elected Zhou Huipu and Xie Fuchu to guide their dispatch. If they can save China from the brink of ruin, they will not seek to preserve their lives in the chaos. Now that the Japanese are pressing on Shanghai, the road between Beijing and Shanghai is full of murderous intent. The capital is shaken, and the country is no longer a country. Donating our lives to serve the country is the time. Wu Yue and others have survived nine deaths and have nothing to miss. We weep all day long, but we only grieve for the fall of our motherland. We will continue our previous alliance and jointly go to the national crisis, rein in the horse at the precipice, reverse the situation from collapse, wave our spears and draw our arrows, and shoot down the sun at dusk. We will not lose the personality of soldiers, and we will not lose an inch of Chinese territory. We are ready to die and have nothing else to worry about. We sincerely hope for the help of overseas Chinese and patriotic people at home and abroad. This heart and this will can be testified by heaven and earth. The telegram is urgent. We hope you will all understand. Wu Yue, First Commander of the Overseas Chinese National Salvation Volunteer Army, Deputy Commander Zhang Hanguang, Brigade Commanders Wang Hanbin, Xu Jian, Cai Zhongyan, Ma Zhengzhi, etc. bow."</p>
<p>Law and Politics College More than 30 students of the Law and Politics College Volunteer Army, including Ma Naishou, Wang Boyan, Ding Shufan, Wang Shanxiang, Wu Zhongding, and Hao Chijun, led by the school instructor Zhang Cheng, went to the Garrison Command at Zhenru last night at 7:00 PM to participate in front-line operations.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops' Hate Killings of Chinese People</h3>
<p>Detailed Reports in Foreign Newspapers</p>
<p>The Zi Lin Bao reports that yesterday (the 1st) afternoon, near the Guanglu Cinema on Suzhou Road, a maid was killed by a stray bullet. Also, at 4:45 PM, a Chinese police officer, No. 1000, from the General Police Station, was returning to his residence on Dong Jiaxing Road when he was shot in the right chest on Zhabu Road Bridge by a team of Japanese marines. He was sent to the Tongren Hospital, but he insisted on returning home to see his daughter one last time. He said he did not know where the bullet came from. At 7:30 AM, a wounded Chinese man was lying on Yalu Road. According to him in the hospital, he was shot in the thigh by Japanese marines. The Da Lu Bao reports that it is rumored that about 150 Chinese people, who were considered plainclothes soldiers by the Japanese, were shot dead by the Japanese. Yesterday morning, the Japanese used several freight cars to carry away their corpses to destroy the evidence. In addition, there are still unknown numbers of people who were shot on the spot. The Tingli Western Clothing Store on Seward Road near Tiantong Road was destroyed by Japanese soldiers last night at 9:00 PM, and two shop assistants were arrested. Yesterday afternoon after 12:00 PM, Japanese soldiers entered a restaurant near Tiantong Road on Wusong Road, supposedly to search for Chinese plainclothes soldiers. Although the people in the restaurant did not resist, two shop assistants were still killed. The Japanese soldiers used a small cart to carry away their bodies. A few minutes before this, two Chinese coolies were ordered to stop on Wusong Road by Japanese soldiers. The two immediately obeyed, but the Japanese soldiers raised their guns and threatened to stab them. The two were startled and fled, and the Japanese soldiers fired five shots and killed them. Their bodies were also carried away by small carts. The Hongkou Hotel was destroyed by Japanese soldiers yesterday, and all rooms were thoroughly searched. Thirty people were arrested, and six people were shot dead on the spot. Their bodies were also carried away by carts. Yesterday morning, someone saw a Japanese soldier dragging two dead Chinese bodies on Wusong Road not far from the Hongkou Police Station. Yesterday afternoon, a coolie was stabbed in the abdomen with a gun by Japanese soldiers on Wusong Road and died in the hospital that night. A representative of the Da Lu Bao personally saw hundreds of Chinese people in the guise of coolies arrested by the Japanese on Tiantong Road and Wusong Road at noon yesterday and taken to the Japanese Club. It is feared that their lives will not be spared. A certain foreigner also personally saw Japanese soldiers on Wusong Road shoot dead a Chinese man selling cakes.</p>
<p>City Government Colleagues Request Mayor Wu</p>
<h3>to Protest the Japanese Army's Massacre of Civilians</h3>
<p>The Joint Office organized by the colleagues of the Municipal Government was established yesterday. In addition to actively carrying out the work of rescuing wounded soldiers and relieving the people, the Joint Office, in light of the Japanese army's continuous massacre of our unarmed civilians, especially requested Mayor Wu to protest immediately, as per the following petition.</p>
<p>Regarding the petition, it is reported that the Japanese army in the Hongkou area has been arbitrarily massacring unarmed Chinese civilians. Even the elderly, weak, women, and children are not spared. Newspapers have repeatedly reported on this in recent days with factual evidence. Their cruel behavior is truly intolerable under human rights and law. Respectfully request the Mayor to promptly lodge a serious protest with the Japanese military authorities, and request the British and American consuls-general to effectively stop this, or it will arouse public anger, and acts of revenge killings will occur in the concessions, and our government will not be responsible. Respectfully submitted to Mayor Wu.</p>
<h3>Foreign Newspaper Records News from the Japanese Side</h3>
<p>Ninety Detained Chinese Released</p>
<p>Withdrawal from Occupied Chinese Police Stations</p>
<p>The Da Mei Wan Bao states that today (the 1st) after noon, the Japanese army set up a machine gun at the southeast corner of Tiantong Road opposite North Sichuan Road, guarded by six people. The muzzle of the gun was pointed at Sichuan Road Bridge. Therefore, the Public Concession police stationed on the south bank of Suzhou Road are now preventing pedestrians and vehicles from crossing the bridge to the north. The Japanese have cleared the pedestrians and vehicles from North Sichuan Road. The reason for this is unknown. According to the staff of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway this morning, the Jisi Feier Railway Bridge was bombed by Japanese planes on Friday. Now, fearing that Japanese planes will bomb from the air again, the east end of the railway has been moved to Fengjing. The staff went there last night. The activities of Japanese ruffians in Hongkou this morning are far less than before. After the First Torpedo Boat Team arrived from Sasebo on Saturday, the commander of the landing marines issued an order that members of the Retired Soldiers Association and members of the Self-Defense Corps were not allowed to take any direct action or carry weapons without proper permission. Therefore, the number of ruffians in Hongkou this morning has been greatly reduced. Those seen in the streets mostly carry clubs and bamboo poles, and few carry weapons. However, there are still many people injured by stray bullets and stabbed by Japanese patrols this morning. A total of sixty-eight Chinese people were admitted to various hospitals for treatment of bullet wounds and stab wounds. About ninety Chinese people who were detained in the Japanese Club on Peng Road in the past two days for being suspected of being plainclothes soldiers by the Japanese were released early this morning. The Hongkou Police Station is still managed by the Western police of the Public Concession. The Japanese marines, who patrolled all the way to the Suzhou River yesterday, are now limited to the Hongkou area north of Peng Road. The Chinese Police Station on Robert Road, which was occupied by Japanese marines the previous two days, was vacated this morning.</p>

<h3>Measures to Maintain Finance</h3>
<p>Banks were allowed to cash banknotes The silver and money industries suspended business to resist the enemy due to the Japanese troops invading the territory, which resulted in financial stagnation, causing panic among the people of Shanghai. In order to maintain finance, a meeting was held the night before last to discuss relief measures. It was decided that, for necessary living expenses of depositors, starting from February 1, each bank would find ways to allow the redemption of banknotes issued by its own bank. Yesterday morning at 8:00 AM, a meeting of the cigarette and exchange industries was convened to discuss the issue. It was agreed that all bank notes would be fully redeemed at cigarette and exchange shops without discounts. Therefore, from 9:00 AM yesterday, all banks in the city, including the Central, China, Communications, Xingye, Shanghai, Juye, and Shiye banks, allowed entry and exit through the back door, allowing the redemption of banknotes and the withdrawal of necessary living expenses by depositors. Generally, cigarette and exchange shops also fully exchanged banknotes above five yuan, with an exchange rate of 10 jiao 100 wen per yuan, 2,500 wen for copper coins, and 470 wen for double hao coins.</p>
<p>Lin Kanghou Asks All Sectors to Rest Assured A reporter from the Shanghai News Agency interviewed Mr. Lin Kanghou of the Bankers' Association about the issue of silver and money industry credit. (Question) Why has the silver and money industry not yet reopened? (Answer) Because the war zone in this city has expanded, transportation has been blocked, the crisis is looming, and order is not stable. Under these circumstances, we have no choice but to temporarily suspend business. (Question) The Lunar New Year is approaching. What flexible measures are there for the cashing of banknotes and the use of small deposits for living expenses? (Answer) During the period of closure, the circulation of banknotes will not be discounted. As for the withdrawal of deposits for living expenses and the payment of wages by various firms and factories, it has also been agreed that payments will be made according to their needs to maintain them. (Question) Is there a definite date for reopening? (Answer) This matter must be acted upon consistently with other industries. Once a decision is made, we can reopen on any day. However, in fact, the silver and money industry is doing its best to facilitate the people in order to circulate the market. All sectors should rest assured.</p>
<h3>Food Supply in This City Is Not a Concern</h3>
<p>Rice in Storage is Sufficient for Two Months The Shanghai Rice Industry Association issued an urgent announcement yesterday, stating that, "Since the Japanese invaded, the price of rice in this city has risen sharply, and the people are suddenly panicked about food. The existing amount of rice in the city, according to our association's estimate, is about 300,000 dan of large rice and 300,000 dan of foreign rice, which is sufficient for more than two months. Moreover, rice ships from various producing areas in the interior are arriving steadily without any obstacles. Our association is in charge of food and should do its best to circulate it. However, during this period, we will temporarily negotiate with cash to maintain the food supply. We hope everyone will rest assured and not panic themselves. This is to announce."</p>
<p>There Is No Shortage of Food According to a survey conducted by the Public Works Department on February 1st, (1) vegetables were transported in from western Shanghai to a slight extent. All vegetable markets in the western district opened at 9:30 AM. The situation in the eastern district was very good except for Wusong Road. However, transportation in Hongkou and Burden and Arlington was cut off, and vegetable prices rose sharply (meat prices remained the same). The quality of green vegetables was poor. (2) Meat: Usually, livestock is transported from Danyang and other places along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, and some is also transported by ship from Wusong. On January 31, the Public Works Department slaughterhouse slaughtered 64 cattle, 35 calves, and 39 pigs. On February 1, the number of live livestock was 87 cattle, 92 sheep, 99 calves, and no pigs. No new livestock arrived on Sunday (but the number arriving at this time of year is usually small). The number of pigs slaughtered in the western district on Saturday night was about the same as usual, and slightly less in other districts. However, there are now 5,000 pigs in Nantou, and there are also pigs in other places outside the boundary. At present, the supply of rice and pork is sufficient. (3) Firewood and charcoal: Reported to be very sufficient. Various shipping companies have a large amount of inventory in Pudong. (4) Transportation: There are currently no difficulties. (5) Milk: There is a slight difficulty, but there is no need to panic, as there is a large amount of canned milk in storage, which is sufficient to supplement the fresh milk coming from the Chinese areas. In general, there is no shortage of food supply at present. Although prices are trending upward, supply and demand are expected to balance soon. The supply of meat from all sides is particularly sufficient.</p>
<p>Letters Requesting Stabilization of the Market Situation The Citizens United Association's letter to the Rice and Cigarette Exchange Industry Associations stated, "Now that the Japanese enemy is invading Shanghai, maintaining order is also an important task. Our association has received many reports from members stating that some merchants disregard public reason and commercial practices, such as rice shops raising rice prices, cigarette and exchange shops exploiting exchange rates, and other shops hoarding goods and raising prices, only knowing how to profit themselves and disregarding the national crisis and the plight of the public. If such unscrupulous merchants are not strictly investigated and regarded as enemies of the people, it will be insufficient to maintain the peace of the refugees. After discussion, the meeting decided that, starting from the 30th, the price of rice and the exchange rate must be restored to the market conditions before the 28th, and the market situation must be stabilized. We urge your association to consider the national crisis and urge all members to comply. This is to the Rice and Cigarette Exchange Industry Associations."</p>
<h3>Efforts to Restore Transportation</h3>
<p>Post Office Operates as Usual The Post and Telecommunications Administration on North Sichuan Road Bridge is now protected by capable international commercial groups dispatched by the Concession authorities. Therefore, it will continue to operate as usual every day from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM. The announcement from the Administration is as follows: "For announcement, the surroundings of this Administration have been protected day and night by the International Commercial Corps dispatched by the Concession authorities. From now on, we will continue to operate as usual every day from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM. We urge all employees to come to the office to work without delay. This is to announce (February 2nd)."</p>

<p>Streetcars Resume Operation Today According to the Shanghai Electric Tramways Company yesterday, streetcars in the Public Concession will resume operation at 9:00 AM tomorrow, the 2nd. However, if there are more fierce battles, they will still be suspended.</p>
<p>Citizens Should Not Linger on the Streets A letter from Citizen Cen Cuheng states, "Now that the situation is serious and the ground is dangerous, the general ignorant and idle people of our country linger and stand on the bridges and sidewalks. This not only damages the appearance but also creates danger. Recent investigations have often heard of people being injured by stray bullets every day. Police officers perform their duties, chasing and driving people away, one after another. Bystanders almost think that a great disaster is about to befall them. In this situation, even the national character is despised by others. I suggest that your chamber of commerce should transfer to the Public Works Department to issue a notice to advise people with nothing to do not to go out. Those who go out should not watch on the road. It is best to use simple slogans to admonish everything."</p>
<h3>Water, Electricity, Transportation, and Public Utilities Operate as Usual</h3>
<p>The General Federation of Trade Unions Urges All Workers to Work as Usual</p>
<p>A reporter from the Shanghai News Agency interviewed Li Yongxiang, Lu Jingshi, Zhu Xuefan, Yu Xianting, Chen Peide, and others in charge of the General Federation of Trade Unions yesterday. According to them, the General Federation of Trade Unions originally had a proposal to order a general strike of all water, electricity, transportation, and public utility workers in the northern and southern districts and the Concession area. The trade unions of these industries had also come to the Federation to request to join. However, in order to take into account the lives of millions of citizens and social peace in this city, the General Federation of Trade Unions has now strongly urged the workers of these unions to continue working as usual. Therefore, water, electricity, transportation, and public utilities in this city will not be interrupted for the time being. The workers of various Chinese factories who have already gone on strike are also planning to be notified to resume work within a few days to avoid stagnation of production and obstruction of industry.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Ships Departed Three Ships Yesterday</h3>
<p>Carrying Nearly 20,000 Refugees</p>
<p>The Ningbo Association in Shanghai, considering the large number of refugees from Ningbo, which made it difficult to accommodate them, negotiated with the Taikoo Company to charter four ships, which would travel back and forth between Shanghai and Ningbo every day starting from the 1st, in order to send them back to their hometowns. The Association posted a notice on the door of the association. Therefore, yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, the Bund section outside the French Concession was blocked by vehicles and was extremely crowded. Because the ships had not yet docked, people were transferred to the ships by sampans. By 11:00 AM, both ships were full of refugees and could not accommodate any more, but people still crowded to board, which was very dangerous. The Ningbo Association received the news and decided to negotiate with the Ningshao Company to restore the Ningshao ships, which had been suspended, to sail to Ningbo. In total, the Xin Ningshao, Xin Beijing, and Zhoushan ships carried nearly 20,000 refugees. The crowded situation was unprecedented. At 3:00 PM, they set sail and left the port.</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai incident occurred, people from Ningbo living in Shanghai have returned to their hometowns one after another. At the same time, Chinese ships have suspended their voyages due to special circumstances, causing the Taikoo Company's Xin Beijing ship to be extremely crowded. In order to prevent tea workers from extorting extra money, the ship strictly prohibited it and issued a notice to passengers that tickets and tips would be charged as before. If there was any extra extortion, identify the number of the tea worker and report it to the accounting room, and they would be immediately dismissed and punished.</p>
<h3>Steamboats Seize Opportunity to Raise Prices</h3>
<p>Far from showing compassion for the refugees</p>
<p>The British company Butterfield &amp; Swire, acceding to the request of the Ningbo-Shaoxing Association, has added Shanghai-Ningbo liners to transport large numbers of refugees to Ningbo. The company decided yesterday to add the "Nanjing," "Zhoushan," and "Hanyang" ships to the existing "New Beijing" liner, operating daily Ningbo services. The Ningbo-Shaoxing Association has issued a public notice about this, so that refugees leaving Shanghai can purchase tickets and board the ships every day. However, recently, the price of ship tickets has greatly increased compared to before. Tickets originally sold for five or six jiao per person have now risen to five or six yuan. Yangtze River steamers have also announced price increases due to the excessive number of refugees scrambling for passage, increasing prices approximately tenfold compared to the original rates. It is reported that the prices of smaller inland river boats going to Suzhou and other places have increased more than thirtyfold recently due to the large number of refugees.</p>
<h3>All Sectors Please Refrain from Setting Off Firecrackers</h3>
<p>To avoid causing public misunderstandings</p>
<p>Setting off firecrackers has always been against regulations, and it should be especially prohibited during these times of terror. Now, at the end of the lunar year, all sectors are still holding New Year's celebrations and paying respects to the gods. Some people, not understanding the situation, are still setting off firecrackers as usual. However, during these tense times, even a single firecracker explosion can easily cause misunderstandings and unsettle people. It is deeply hoped that sensible citizens will absolutely refrain from setting off firecrackers, as this is also a way to maintain social order.</p>
<h3>The Oriental Library Was Burned Down Yesterday (Photo by Li Zunyong)</h3>
<p>French Concession</p>
<h3>Defense Work is Tight</h3>
<p>Driving in wooden stakes...laying out electric nets</p>
<p>Piling sandbags...building fortifications</p>
<p>Since learning that the Public Concession had issued an order to cut off traffic every night from 10:00 PM to 4:00 AM starting yesterday, the French Concession authorities believed that the situation was becoming more serious. They immediately ordered the Public Works Department of the Municipal Council to supervise laborers, dividing them to rush to drive wooden stakes, lay out electric nets, actively pile sandbags, and build fortifications at the crossroads and key routes on the border between the British and French Concessions on Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Foch. According to local elders in this port, this phenomenon is a first since the establishment of the concessions. Although China has been in civil war for years, the concession authorities have only closely guarded against the Chinese areas when there were impacts on this port. Now that this kind of terrifying phenomenon is occurring in the concession itself, it is truly something that we did not expect.</p>
<h3>French Military Police Protect the Security of the Concession</h3>
<p>The French Concession authorities solemnly declared that the French military police authorities are responsible for protecting the lives and property of all Chinese and foreigners within the French Concession, and that soldiers of any country are not allowed to carry military weapons through or be stationed in the French Concession to replace the duties that the French authorities should fulfill.</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests</p>
<h3>The Municipal Council to Disarm Japanese Police</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Chairman of the Municipal Council yesterday, stating: We write to inform you that since the Japanese Marine Corps provoked the Chinese army in Zhabei on January 28, many Japanese merchants residing in Shanghai have formed plainclothes teams, privately hoarding weapons, and wantonly massacring good Chinese citizens, or privately kidnapping them and secretly executing them. Countless lives and properties have been lost as a result. The atrocities of the Japanese plainclothes soldiers in the concession and the suffering of the Chinese people as recorded in the North-China Daily News probably do not fully represent even one-tenth of the situation. However, this one aspect alone is enough to prove that the Japanese's actions of disregarding reason and killing Chinese people have fundamentally shaken your Council's ability to maintain security within the concession. Although it is claimed that several instances were discovered by American soldiers and immediately stopped, the number of Japanese merchants residing in Shanghai is large, and their range of activities is extremely broad. Chinese people being murdered by them at any time and in any place cannot be prevented by just a few Allied soldiers patrolling the concession. Since the concession authorities have no measures to stop or eliminate these Japanese people carrying weapons and forming plainclothes teams, the Chinese citizens in the concession have no choice but to also be allowed to freely carry weapons without restriction, without being subject to your Council's usual rules, so that they can rise up and defend themselves when the Japanese plainclothes teams murder Chinese people. If your Council cannot accept this proposal, it is tantamount to allowing the Japanese to have the right to slaughter Chinese people at will. The importance of this matter is so significant that we dare not speak of the consequences, which we believe is not your Council's original intention of treating all residents of the concession equally. Furthermore, the police in the concession are under your Council's jurisdiction and have the duty to maintain security. If they wish to participate in their own country's war, they should immediately resign from their police duties. However, since the outbreak of the war in Zhabei, many of the Japanese police officers in the concession have been acting in the same manner as the plainclothes teams, which violates the discipline they should observe towards your Council and poses a great threat to the Chinese people. The reason for this phenomenon is that your Council, during this incident, actually confiscated all the weapons of the Chinese police officers, while allowing the Japanese police officers to continue carrying their weapons. Therefore, our Association believes that your Council should also immediately confiscate all the weapons carried by the Japanese police officers in the concession as well, as that would be the right thing to do. We sincerely hope that you will investigate and handle this matter immediately. We thank you greatly. This is addressed to the Public Concession Municipal Council.</p>
<h3>Comfort Efforts Compete</h3>
<p>Mr. Chen Donates 10,000 Yuan to Support the Troops Yesterday, Mr. Chen sent a check for 10,000 yuan to this newspaper, requesting that it be forwarded to the soldiers at the front to provide comfort. His patriotic fervor is truly commendable. The original letter reads: To the General Manager of the Shanghai Shen Bao Newspaper: We write to inform you that during this Shanghai campaign, our country's benevolent and righteous army has subdued the fierce and barbaric enemies and established a complete victory, enough to make the Japanese bandits lose their courage and the foreign powers feel chilled. Our government, which has been mired in a bitter and hopeless environment for a long time, has taken advantage of this heaven-sent opportunity, and in the eyes of the world, has instantly leaped to a position of supreme glory. We plan to make the merits of this battle last for ten thousand years, so that it can be compared with General Washington in history. Isn't it magnificent? Alas, my four hundred million beloved compatriots, it is time to raise our eyebrows and exhale! Who doesn't know that we have suffered enough shame? The East is no longer the sick man; the sleeping lion has awakened! We vow to embrace the heart of shattering jade, and not be slaves of a conquered nation. At this time of national crisis, we would rather sacrifice our lives and property, and it would be glorious to die. Those who hoard private property and cling to life are unforgivable. I am lonely and poor, my family is cold and my strength is weak. Recently, I saw in your newspaper that you are comforting the soldiers at the front, so I am doing my best to support you. I have attached a check for 10,000 yuan, and I urge your newspaper to cash it immediately and hand it over to the authorities, so that I may be forever grateful. Chen Qiqi, February 1st, Year 21. Attached is a supporting slip from the Bank of China.</p>
<p>Military Headquarters Needs Vehicles The Battlefield Service Committee and First Aid Director Yan Wanzhang of the City Boy Scout Council accompanied a delegation to the 19th Route Army Headquarters in Zhenru the other day to donate comfort items, and met with General Cai. According to him, various sectors have sent comfort items, and he is deeply grateful for their kindness. However, what the army currently needs are light transportation vehicles, such as motorized bicycles, as well as medical supplies and equipment. In the future, all sectors should pay attention to this when preparing comfort items.</p>
<p>Banks' Armored Cars Should Be Provided for Military Transport After this newspaper published the military headquarters' need for transport vehicles, there have been many cases of various sectors donating cars and gasoline. Yesterday, a certain gentleman with military knowledge said that armored cars are best for transporting military supplies. Many banks in this port have armored cars for transporting silver. Now that they have closed down and have no silver to transport, if the bank authorities were motivated by righteousness and temporarily lent these cars to the military headquarters for transportation, it would be a great help to the military.</p>
<p>Multiple Cases of Car Donations (Two Trucks) The Shanghai National Goods Factories Association, due to the front line's need for trucks and other supplies, yesterday specially collected two trucks, four hundred pairs of running shoes, beef, bread, and other foods. Gu Juru, Shen Mengshi, and Fei Xiaochu were appointed to send them to the front lines to boost morale. (Two Cars) In addition to the one hundred dan of rice that the Chaozhou Association sent to the 19th Army the day before yesterday, they are still sending two motorcycles and five hundred wool shirts today, as well as twenty dan of rice. They have also decided to establish a refugee shelter for Chaozhou refugees and pay attention to the issue of the families of soldiers who died for the country, and have already passed the principles for handling the aftermath. (One Truck and One Motorized Bicycle) Mr. Sheng Xiegui donated a brand new one-and-a-half-ton Chevrolet truck yesterday. Steelworkers who volunteered to serve have already begun transporting reinforcements to the front lines for deployment, according to a report from the headquarters. Several Chinese employees of a certain car dealership donated 400 tins of gasoline. Mr. Guo of the Zilaihuo Company donated a D.K.W. motorized bicycle. General Cai told the representatives of the agencies that he was extremely grateful for the donations from all sectors, but because there were too many items, it was not economical. Therefore, from today onwards, the relief organizations will only accept cash to purchase the necessary items on their behalf.</p>
<p>Donating Gasoline is Practical (City Government Colleagues) Shanghai City Government colleagues sent representatives in a hired car to deliver one hundred boxes of gasoline and six boxes of engine oil yesterday afternoon at two o'clock. (Guangdong Club)</p>
<p>The Guangdong Club sent one hundred tins of gasoline yesterday.</p>
<p>Mountains of Bread (Chang Shengji Factory) Chang</p>
<p>Zhou Shengji Factory and Wansheng Iron Factory jointly sent sixteen dozen loaves of bread. (Press)</p>
<p>(Labor Union) The Shanghai Labor Union sent representatives Hu Zhiqi and Ye Tongsheng to deliver 10,000 loaves of bread yesterday. (Stock Exchange) The Chinese Stock Exchange sent 6,000 loaves of bread and sixty dozen oil-braised bamboo shoots yesterday.</p>
<p>Comfort Food Must First Be Tested The Chinese Red</p>
<p>Cross Society, because many people have been falsely claiming to comfort wounded soldiers and soldiers at the front lines these days, is returning all food intended for the front-line soldiers, except for a portion of the wounded soldiers who have been taken in in accordance with the International Convention. Fearing that the enemy may impersonate Chinese people and send in poisoned food, all items received are tested. First, they are fed to dogs, sheep, chickens, and pigs, and then distributed to the wounded soldiers to show caution.</p>
<p>New Pharmaceutical Industry Sends Medicines The New Pharmaceutical Industry Association, due to the need for medicines for the wounded soldiers of the 19th Route Army, sent representatives to deliver more than eighty kinds of first-aid medicines, including hemostatic solution, iodine, injection solution, petroleum, flat-shaped pills, cotton gauze, boric acid powder, band-aids, Lysol, ten drops of water, potassium permanganate, aspirin, milk, and bandages. The headquarters issued a receipt to express its gratitude.</p>
<p>The General Labor Union Handles Comfort Work The City</p>
<p>The General Labor Union expressed its determination to support the 19th Route Army's brave resistance against Japan. In addition to organizing volunteer armies, first aid teams, transport teams, and fire brigades, and ordering all labor unions to do their best to solicit comfort items for the anti-Japanese army, they have also set up a collection point at the Zhigonghui in the Zhaoshangju's Pier 5 at No. 44 Bund outside Xinkai River to facilitate delivery. Yesterday, they received twenty-two boxes of beef and ten large boxes of biscuits from the Postal Workers' Union and immediately sent them to the front lines to reward the soldiers. All labor unions or individuals with various comfort items can send them directly to that location.</p>
<p>Women's Association Collects Comfort Items The Shanghai Women's World Comfort Association for the soldiers protecting the country, solicits comfort items. Please send them directly to the Association at No. 414 Pubo Road, French Concession, and obtain a receipt. Comfort items are as follows: (1) Cash, (2) Food, (3) Medicines, cotton, gauze, iodine, stimulants, (4) Supplies, clothing, bedding, shoes, towels, flannel.</p>
<p>Enthusiasm of the Tenants of Siwen Lane Qi Guanliu, Tao Zongxiang, and others, tenants of Siwen Lane, Xinzha Road, initiated a comfort donation among the tenants. From 7:00 AM to 10:00 PM the day before yesterday, they went door-to-door to solicit donations and collected more than 220 yuan and 500 packs of Lingdan. Yesterday, Mr. Qi personally sent them to the Ningbo Association for inspection and transfer.</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Announces a Request for Cash Donations City</p>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce issued a public notice yesterday regarding the conversion of collected comfort items for soldiers into cash, stating: Since the Chamber of Commerce initiated the collection of items to comfort the soldiers at the front, all sectors have enthusiastically donated, showing that the hearts of the people have not died. However, most of the items sent are food, and most of the food is cooked food. The weather has been warm in recent days, and the quality and taste of the food easily deteriorate when transported to the front lines. There are also cases where the food does not suit the eating habits of the southerners or is supplied in excess of what is needed. The health of the soldiers is related to the strength of the combat force, so we must be careful and cautious. If we allow the waste of material resources, we will not be able to face the various sectors that have sincerely donated. After careful consideration, the Chamber of Commerce requests that all sectors, in the future, donate cash instead of food to comfort the soldiers at the front lines. The Chamber of Commerce will investigate the items actually needed by the front lines and entrust the industries to purchase them properly, so that it will be helpful to military use and financial resources will not be wasted. All donations will still be properly collected by the three designated offices. The amount of money collected and the situation of the purchased items will be disclosed in the newspaper when the income accounts are announced. We hope for your public understanding.</p>
<h3>News of Relief Work</h3>
<p>City Government Employees Rescue Refugees and Wounded Soldiers Employees of various bureaus of the Municipal Government of this city are very indignant at the Japanese soldiers' unwarranted invasion and willful burning and looting. They have initiated a donation of one-tenth of their salaries to reward our fighting soldiers. Representatives from various bureaus have organized a joint office, and the Bide Elementary School on Route Lafayette has been designated as the office to carry out the rescue of wounded soldiers and the relief of refugees. They have also contacted various hospitals to reserve more than a thousand beds. They are currently working with the Red Cross Society and the Red Swastika Society to transport our wounded soldiers for treatment. Several hundred sets of cotton clothing and bedding needed for the wounded have been prepared for application. Regarding the escort of refugees from Zhabei to a safe location, due to the large number of people, they have contacted the Municipal Council and plan to send them to the Public Concession, but have not yet received the gist of the matter. They are preparing to negotiate again or find other ways to achieve their goal. Furthermore, the Federation of City Government Employees, because the Japanese soldiers arbitrarily harmed the people, sent a report to Mayor Wu, stating that according to reports from various parties, the Japanese army in the Hongkou area arbitrarily harmed Chinese non-resistant people, and even the old, weak, women, and children were not spared. Newspapers have repeatedly reported this in recent days, and it is indeed well-founded. Their actions are cruel and intolerable by human law. Respectfully request that you, sir, promptly issue a strong protest to the Japanese military authorities and ask the British and American consuls-general to effectively stop them, otherwise, if it provokes public anger and leads to revenge killings in the concession, our country will not be responsible.</p>

<h3>Negotiations to Return Firearms to the Local Defense Corps</h3>
<p>The Citizen's United Association sent a letter to the General Office of the Public Works Department yesterday regarding the return of firearms to the local defense corps in the Fahua District. The letter stated: "We are writing to inform you that we have received a letter from the Third District branch of our association, stating that on the 29th of this month at 9:00 AM, two members of the second team of the Shanghai Fahua District Local Defense Corps were detained by British troops while patrolling near the old Xiaowanliutang front of the Jessfield Road. Although negotiations took place, only the members were released. The three rifles and 123 bullets they carried were confiscated. Furthermore, at 5:00 PM, British soldiers, dispatched by the Jing'an Temple Police Station, searched the team's premises and confiscated eight rifles, one shotgun, three bayonets, one wooden gunstock, six Kowloon belts, six pistol holsters, 230 rifle bullets, and 163 pistol bullets. Receipts were issued for both incidents. At this time of tense situation, the team's sudden loss of self-defense capabilities has increased the panic among residents. Accordingly, we write to your department to request that you investigate and handle the matter to ensure safety." The letter continued, "The Hejing Local Defense Corps is organized by merchants and civilians and does not involve political factions. They have achieved remarkable results in defending the area during the wars of 1924 and 1927. The police and foreign troops have expressed their appreciation and have not interfered. As the situation is tense, the robbery of shops was even reported on Zhongshan Road last night. Self-defense is essential. Furthermore, it is reported that the officers of the troops had previously contacted the Sixth District Office of the Municipal Public Security Bureau and the personnel of the Local Defense Corps to adopt a cooperative approach. Why did they suddenly break their promise? In accordance with the aforementioned letter, we request that you investigate and negotiate to return the firearms to facilitate service and secure the area." The letter also stated: "The Caojiadu Merchant Corps is composed of legitimate merchants in the area and is dedicated to defending the area. Your department is well aware of this. We do not know how the weapons were confiscated by foreign soldiers in the area. We deeply regret this and hereby write to request that you forward this to the military leaders for them to clarify the misunderstanding and promptly return the firearms to maintain friendly relations and contribute to the defense of the area." The letter was addressed to the General Office of the Public Works Department of the Public Concession.</p>
