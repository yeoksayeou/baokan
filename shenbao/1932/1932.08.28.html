<h3 id="c1">論列强對日外相演説之態度元 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>日本而果下决心不顧一切信義條約。則老實承認爲國可矣。吾若稍兼顧信義條約。則無論如何。總無以自圓其説。日本而果决破壞世界和平甘願擾亂東亞大局。則承認僞國可也。即進而攻熱河。龔平津。甚至擾我全國。亦無不可。若稍有愛護和平顧全大局之念。則無如何。亦難曲爲自解。彼内田外相之在國會演説。謂承認滿洲。乃固定遠東久遠和平之唯一方法。也中國境内紊亂與革命。乃遠東國際不幸變化之原因也。九一事變。係出自衛行動。並不違反非戰公約也。直接採用武力以防止利權損害。乃係向來習慣。非自日本始也。滿洲國之建設。乃由當地領袖之决議。爲一種分離運動之結果。日本不負其責也。最後並再三聲明無開疆拓土之野心。而又不面意於敷衍了事之解决。其種種與事實相反之點。實令人舉不勝。舉駁不勝駁其言非特我國人所不信。即世界各國人士。非皆孩提。當亦無人肯輕易置信。然而内田外相。必於此國聯報告未提出之前。發此滔滔不竭之聲明者。其用意固非在使列强之必信。而在表示其堅决强硬之態度。拒絶英美與國聯方面之干涉。婉言之暗。諷列强使之見幾而止。質言之。恫喝列强。使其不敢輕動。故列强對此聲明。究竟抱如何應付之態度。則值得吾人注意者也。</p>
<p>今據國外電訊。英美兩國政府。對此聲明。皆不欲於調查團報告提到國際聯盟以前。有所表示。暫以一個悶葫蘆對付日本。固亦因問題之關係重大。非有極審愼之考慮。難以表示也。英美兩國報紙。雖對日外相之演説。多加以指斥與譏諷。類皆歸結於日人之違反九國公約與凱洛格公約。無可諱言。然吾人固不能據一般人之輿論。而即以推斷政府當局之心理。蓋今日國際間之形勢。外交上之手段。縱横捭閻。千變萬化。决非局外人事前所能預测。惟吾人於事實上所敢斷言者。今日東亞局勢。己至至危極險之時。二次大戰之呼聲。愈逼愈緊。星火一燃。立即爆發而。此爆發二次戰禍之藥綫。固不握於日人而握於英美諸强國之手。世界上以武力侵略人國者。惟有公理正義足以制裁之。亦非公理正義之空言所能制裁。乃多數强國眞心信仰此公理。正義。始是以制裁。多數强國能鑒於時機之不可稍縱。無論如何艱苦困難。必同心合力</p>
<p>以維持此公理正義。苟有一二野心者欲藉武力以破壞我維持公理正義之公約羣起而加以制裁。雖恐喝而有所不懼。則野心者自不得不知難而退。否則依違顧慮。欲以敷衍爲調停。遷就爲解决。一旦勢窮力竭。危機破裂。則敢必蔓延横溢。雖欲收拾而無可收拾。至是始覺悟苟且和平之非計。而己無及矣。故吾謂今日手握禍機爆發與否之火缐者。亟當鄭重考量於先也。</p>
<p>吾爲此言。非欲借英美列强之力以自救也。亦非挑撥列强對日開釁以自快也吾國處此武力壓迫之情勢。下早己拚爲世界犧牲品矣。處今日情勢。吾國固不能不犧牲。即將來不幸而至世界大戰。吾國亦不過犧牲而止。獨惜大戰一開。所犧牲者不僅我一國。世界各國將舉蒙重大之騷動。吾不知列强各政府果甘心將數年來奔走和平消弭戰禍之苦心經營。抛棄於一旦乎。如其否也。則在此時局緊急之關頭。亟應有以自處。</p>

<p>自由談	二一枝譚廬藤  瞻廬　　上海人口中的「牽絲扳藤」、蘇州人口中的「只有藤繞樹，没有樹繞藤」，現在都成了諺讖。有了傀儡國，一定要有牽絲的人，武藤到傀儡國去做太上執政了丨從此以後，傀儡執政的一舉一動，都仗着這根藤兒做　動機：傀儡的絲，便扳住在藤枝上面，若要牽絲，必須扳藤：這便呌做牽絲扳藤。　　中國宛比棵孤立無助的大樹，經了悠久的年代，周圍的枝葉，常常受着外界的剥削而無力抵抗丨單是剥削枝葉，倒也罷了：最近時代、又有許多野藤，要來束縛樹身！彼國的藤内閣，藤大將，誰也都是不利於這棵老樹的，誰也都是要來束縛樹身的。受着藤繞的樹，也想竭力擺脱：無奈，被這兩句蘇州俗語説煞了：「只有藤繞樹，没有樹繞藤」，看來，樹該吃虧，藤該佔着理宜吧。我又想着一句各處普徧的俗語了，呌做「割藤斷絶」。可見最後的方法，惟有出於割藤斷絶：但是，怎樣的割藤斷絶？這句俗語還悶在葫蘆裏面，没有成爲事實：待到成了事實，再行註解也不遲。滕參謀斷脅臂抗日記  燕子　　自一二八滬變發生。幸頼十九軍第五軍忠勇將士。血戰三旬。屢挫敵燄。爲國争榮。當時吴淞砲臺。因未奉明令。堅守不動。而敵艦得自由出入。增兵來援。蔡軍長見敵軍雲集。乃令鄧振銓司令堅拒敵艦。戰事乃開始互轟。鄉人朱正福青年負大志。隸獅子林砲臺。爲臺主施澤所倚重。昨遇諸途。詢其作戰之經過。猶不禁談虎色變也。朱言當時惜無高射砲。否則决不至砲臺全裂。士卒重創。每遇飛機環攻。軍士悉仰臥田中。執步槍以抗敵。敵艦所發之砲。標凖毫無。咸超過砲臺數十步。而我砲弁陶某發一砲。彈祇百磅。中敵艦瞭望臺。死敵大尉一。敵艦立沉。是時士氣頓旺。共轟燬敵艦三。而敵艦來援者共十八艘。飛機翔集於天空者三十六架。炸彈砲彈。紛如氷電。勝參謀長指揮作戰。傷左臂幾折。然猶手持機槍掃敵。瞪目大呼。往來轟擊。未幾左臂爲敵彈轟去。滿身血濺。衛兵挾之乘人力車。擬退往後方醫治。滕隻手持槍遥擊敵機。不肯少息。末後敵機環攻。烟霧漫空。遂不知滕之踪跡。然全臺將士。各自爲戰。餘勇可愛。英美兵艦之觀戰將士。咸贊嘆我軍之神勇。而載諸報章。及至奉令退後時。祇獅子林砲臺。尚存一砲未燬。而士卒則十傷八九矣。言罷。頻揮血涙。爲之欷歔者久之。余亦不禁爲之扼腕也。雞鳴風雨話長春  古呆　　東北淪陷。傀儡登塲。揚幕之日。日人假傀儡之口。而昭告於民衆。以及各友邦領事。與新聞記者曰。滿洲國爲世界上最文明國家之一。殺絞凌遲。一概廢除。槍斃一法。亦屬有違人道。舉凡一切死刑。均以電斃執行。嗣即義軍蠭起。日人疲於奔命。勞兵傷財。捉襟見肘。於是老羞成怒。所獲俘虜。悉處以腰斬之慘刑。無俘虜。則捕市民之被視爲有與義軍通聲氣之嫌者。腰斬之。以長春一地而言。日必有四人至七人之數。罹此酷刑。外僑均爲側目。　　其次。於長春郊外。獲一某路救國軍之參謀。檢其衣袴。於青布袴之夾層問。搜得一日方之軍事方案。一時機謀外洩。各僞機關。莫不張皇失措。合市戒嚴。以備萬一。而一方則將該參謀嚴刑拷問。訊以該方案之來源。參謀誓不招供。竟死於鞭棍之下。越數日。又獲一另一路義軍之聯絡員。亦搜得另一軍事方案。刑訊之下。聯絡員不堪其苦。乃供稱該方案係自某警局坂田氏所購得者。翌日。該聯絡員即腰斬於市。而坂田則押解回國。　　長春。今己爲滿洲國之首都。故日報業亦漸形發達。惟所有報紙。非日人所經營。即傀儡之所設。私人所經營者。或商辦者。不能立足。於是所發言論。盡爲向日軍歌功頌德之辭。對於義軍消息。雖片言隻字。亦不可得。某次。義軍夜襲距長春三十華里之某鎭。長春己隐約可聞砲擊。而翌晨各報。仍未有紀載。至十時許。有難民八十餘人。狼狽入城避難。日軍謂爲擾亂人心。指爲義軍之别動隊。以機關槍掃射之。擊斃三十餘人。衆遂紛散。翌晨。各報乃詳爲登載。譽爲保國衛民。　　上述數則。均爲余表兄之所述。蓋余表兄。夙營雜糧大豆之買空賣空於長春。邇者。日商倚槍桿子之勢力。步步進逼。致華人無利可圖。而更怵於腰斬之禍。乃踉蹌南歸。絮絮爲余道長春之聞兒。兹篇之所紀者。猶不及其所言者之十一也。莫干山劍池大雨後之瀑  鈞碩　　莫干山以劍得名。吴王闔閭使干將鑄劍。干將與其妻莫邪。在山冶金鐵之精而爲之。其後即以其夫婦之名名山。所謂劍池者。即干將夫婦磨劍處。劍池有瀑布。雖不及碧隖瀑布之大。顧朝夕異觀。山徑幽邃。巖石奇突。萬竹蕭森。終歲泉聲盈耳。實異境也。碧隖路遠。違莫干山各旅館。十五六里。劍池不過一二里。近者止里許。是以避暑之人。時來觀瀑。大抵日將出。則來此小憩。日既入。又一度徘徊。朝霞染丹。暮雲絢彩。與瀑泉相映射。誠百觀不厭者也。余以八月八日傍晚。一往觀瀑。明晨又至。逆旅主人語余曰。天時亢旱。不雨月餘矣。雖劍池飛瀑。終歲可觀。然使天降大雨。則萬流皆匯。其勢浩大。非尋常可比。則誠壯觀矣。惜火雲常流。旱魃爲虐。一時無從得此奇景耳。余曰。今雖旱。然天無永久不雨者。惜余明日即當歸去。不能少待耳。既而進午餐。餐未畢。雲起脚下。滿山彌漫。頃之。大雨至。勢若排山倒海。余擊掌賞之曰。觀雨後之瀑。時機至矣。逆旅主人亦爲余慶曰。天假之緣。良非易易。雨二小時始止。迨雲開雨歇。天氣旋現清朗。乃向逆旅主人借竹杖。往劍池。觀大雨後之飛瀑。或以路滑尼止之。且云。石級上泉噴盈溢。必不能步。余急思一觀。不欲坐失良機。氣不爲綏。遂往。至則果不易步。乃赤足而度。坐於飛瀑對面觀之。其勢之大。幾如倒瀉銀河。又如飛濤滾雪。森森有冷氣襲人。與向觀二次絶異。其聲震耳。若萬壑陰雷。奔吼不絶。逆旅主人所云。非尋常可比之壯艱。以爲一時不可得到者。乃於數小時中遇之。余心爲之大快。天下事。機緣凑合。有如是之順利者乎。劍池爲干將莫邪夫婦磨劍處。今東北義勇軍。十萬横磨。奮勇殺敵。冀其於所欲得者。亦有天緣之凑合。如今日之大雨。以助其忠義之氣。而速成功。則余心不更快矣哉客館談馬記  執玉館主　　前閲報悉黑省主席馬占山將軍。因敵人造謡。恐勞國人懸念。特派騎二旅五團田團長秀翹爲代表。躦程南來。與朝野各方接洽並報告一切。結果均頗圓滿。爰特於昨日往謁田代表於其行館。時適黑省黨指委吴君渙章亦在座。乃相與縱談馬將軍生平軼事。及抗日軍興後戰况。語次吴君探囊取一卷出示。謂此本埠時化書局甫於前日出版之馬將軍演義也。書中紀馬將軍生平。自幼迄今四十年來經過事實。至爲詳確。堪與吾儕適間所言各事相對照。君閲後當信吾言。愚亟接而展讀之。覺其情文並茂。纔數回至述將軍尊堂壯年之一段俠義姻緣。時因訪者踵至。遂不克卒讀。興辭而歸。歸後猶縈迴腦際。久久不能去懷。乃遣僕人逕赴該局。專購該書。閲之竟夕始畢。果與吴田二君之所談之將軍軼事無殊。頗足以激忠勸義。振奮民族精神不少。吾不知凡曾讀該書者。作何感想也。（却酬）二十一條秘史（六）  思蘋　　路過長崎。我呌路易士送一份二十一條要求給美國駐日公使格斯里。這是他初次得悉二十一條的内容。所以很感謝我。但是他向日本人方面遍詢眞相。不得要領。認爲我是完全錯了。　　到了檀香山。美國聯合新聞社記者就來問我二十一的眞僞。一九一五年四月十九日到舊金山。把行蹤電告國務卿白萊安。白萊安即復電約期會見。四月二十五日到紐約。替日本宣傅的格立克博士來訪。他對我説。他己經拿了一份二十一條要求見過日本駐美公使珍田。珍田調完全不確。並謂日本雖提出幾條要求。但所謂二十一條則不確。格立克也是以爲日本不致提出這類苛刻的要求的。就責我被人愚弄了。我對他説且慢下斷語。他問我是否到華盛頓去。他並且對我説。拿這二十一條呈報國務院是不對的。我説我幾星期前就把這二十一條電告國務院了。他聽了大不以爲然。問我是否願同珍田一晤。我表示同意。　　四月二十六日到了華盛頓。我就在上午十時訪白萊安。談半小時。白萊安約我下午一時去同他午餐長談。他己把我寄給他的二十一條看過。認爲確實。珍田公使也送給白萊安一份二十一條要求。珍田對他説。一部分要求不過表示日本的願望而己。我就告訴他。珍田又想欺騙他了。日本現正在以增兵威脅袁世凱。堅持二十一條全部承認呢。我説惟有威爾遜總統和他能夠阻止中日兩國發生戰争。他們必須速使日本知道美國對日本憑藉武方脅迫中國承認二十一條感覺深切的不滿才好。　　威爾遜總統深覺遠東局勢緊張。下令一星期内任何人不能延見。他孑身悄然離京。到窮鄉僻壤。細心研究這嚴重的問題。所以我也没有見他。就回到紐約。我一到了旅館。格立克就來看我。我因知日本的注意我的行動了。　　離開美京之前。我曾訪中國駐美公使。請他拍一電給袁世凱。電文大意如下。堅持取銷或修改日本侵害中國主權的要求。其餘各條能承認則承認之。過了幾天。我聽説日本因英美的干涉。己放棄二十一條的一部分了。（完）</p>

<p>歐亞航空、自去歲由歐亞航空公司管運組前主任李景樅一度試飛、結果良佳、公</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>司方面、遂積極籌備、經數次董事會議結果、决議規定八九兩月、爲全線試航時間、公司當即依照議决案於本月十日、派營運組主任廖觀玄·機航組主任石密德·乘機由北平出發、作全線試飛、據該公司秘書孫慕唐君談、試飛經過及正式開航確期、並粤漢線籌劃情形頗詳、亟録如下、</p>
<p>▲試機滯蘭據孫君談、歐亞航線、自本公司營運組主任廖觀玄·機航組主任石密德·乘歐亞六號機自北平起飛後、早於日前抵蘭州、因沿途佈置塲站、及汽油問題、故途汽中頗多躭擱、兼以肅州氣候關係、致現尚滯留蘭州、報載己由蘭試航至迪化、並云業由迪飛返、試航成功云云、全非事實、本公司昨日尚接石密德來電、現確在蘭州、日内仍繼續飛行、經過各地之塲站間佈置、大致就緒、汽油亦無問題、惟將來正式飛航、哈密至迪化段汽油、仍須向俄國購買、蓋新疆雖有汽油、均未煉過、不能應用、以後交通成功、該處實行開發後、汽油問題、似可不致再向俄方購買、至哈密至迪化一段、此段爲全綫最難飛行之處、以中途全屬沙漠、平日交通須七天、由駱駝載運、倘將來試航成功、交通當可便利不少也、</p>

<p>▲由中央銀行代收税率减低</p>
<p>▲各外商銀行正在交涉徵收</p>

<p>新聲社云、據中央銀行消息、紙幣發行税、現經銀行公會代表、一再與宋財長洽商結果、財部己允减低税率、惟能减至若干、則須經財政部核議後、方可正式發表、但財部以需用孔亟、先請各發行銀行、預繳税欵、聞截至昨日爲止、本市本國發行銀行、均己繳付、送由中央銀行代收、外商銀行之發行鈔票者、有匯豐、麥加利·花旗·東方·華比·等行、發行總額、亦尚可觀、聞政府正在交涉徵收中、</p>
<p>中央社云、財部徵收紙幣發行税問題、迭經磋商、前日銀行界代表李馥蓀·胡筆江·兩氏、再度往謁宋部長、繼續商談、昨據中央社記者探悉、此次財部徵收紙幣發行税之原因有二、（一）各國發行紙幣者、均爲國家銀行、雖一國可通行各種不同之紙幣、但其發行權、則均屬諸政府、正如我國之郵票、雖有總理·廖仲愷·黃克强·等各種不同之郵票、而其發行權、則亦均屬諸政府、我國之紙幣則不然、商辦銀行經特許亦得發行、統計目前全國通行之紙幣、共約三萬萬元、商辦銀行發行者、且佔其大半、政府爲防止紙幣充斥市面計、决定根據紙幣發行權屬諸政府之原則、實行徵收紙幣發行税、（二）宋部長爲維持政府之信用計、故對於每月公債本息八百萬之支出、無論財政若何困難、均設法按期照付、每月支出之軍政等費、爲數亦甚鉅、故不得不謀開源、徵收紙幣發行税、早經中央明令頒布在案、是以財部决定遵令實行徵收、决不因任何困難而中止、此次銀行界因市面不振、請求財部减低税率、財部己允略減、惟銀行界要求减至百分之一、因較原定税率相差太鉅、難成事實、財部方面之最低限度爲減至百之一·五、至於向銀行界借欵一節財部方面則極端否認、宋部長己定今日飛京、但此項問題并不因宋氏離滬而停頓、蓋財部既允减低税率、此後將由中間接洽者出而斡旋、以求解决也、</p>

<p>— 佛</p>
<p>昨日本刋中有張同君改良墳墓討論一文，張君此文，是對於朱允宗改良墳墓問題一文而發，他的意思，謂朱君主張公墓制度，猶未經濟，主張火葬，　　我對於張同君的意思，完全贊同，而對於張同君所擬之辦法，有些不敢和附，雖火葬之舉，日本行之，南洋羣島有處亦行之，不過我對於火葬之舉，於良心上總有些不忍，認爲大覺慘無人道，因此想起從前有椿笑話，</p>
<p>某君素吝嗇，生有三子，及某君將死，召三子而詢之，曰我死，爾輩將何以辦理善後，長子曰，衣衾棺槨，享祀必豐，某君怒曰，不肖，爾將敗我家矣，復問次子，次子曰，衣以苜蓿，棺以蒲包，埋諸中土，某君曰，尚費事，乃詢幼子，幼子曰，剖而醃之，陳諸屠肆，以餉求者，某君曰，此法大佳，不過余有一言，問壁阿二，不要賒他，因脾氣甚劣，不肯還錢也</p>
<p>此種笑話，駡一般守財奴，雖覺過於刻毒，然世間吝嗇之輩，容有是等樣人，這件笑話，雖與主張火葬無關，但一種寒酸殘忍的心理，似覺恍惚，故拉雜書之，以博張君一噱，</p>
<p>但我對於墳墓之制，究屬如何，可算心安理得，尚没有想到良善的方法，不過我對於舊式的墳墓，天然反對，而於現在大概所辦之公墓，還嫌有些貴族化，應該還要想一種經濟的辦法</p>

<p>丨同温層探險丨</p>
<p>同温層探險倒底是怎麽一會事呢？而值得畢卡德教授一次（上年五月二十七日）二次（八月十八日）和三次的冒險、，對於一般人，猶其不念科學的·大概值得知道罷，請讀這一篇簡短的叙述，</p>
<p>畢氏這次上升主要的目的，爲測騐「宇宙光」的强度，與高度的關係，這一事在物理學上，氣象學上和天文學上有無量價值、</p>
<p>（二）物理學上的貢獻，物理學上最新的問題之中，「質能同原論」可算最受重視的一個，水銀變金，氫氣凝成氦，諸</p>
<p>種事實，和原子潛能之利用一斑理想，丨什麽一克水内的潛能可供一郵船横渡太平洋等等，都隨之而起，可知這方面研究若能有相當結果，世界文明必然由「石油時代」，「黑煤時代」「電氣時代」而進至「原子力時代」「那是在一九０三年光景，歐州物理家發見了放射性原質，此後又覺地面上有滲透力極强而類似Ｘ光的光波存在，依據Ｍilksan的測騐，此光波日夜同樣地强烈，也不隨季節而異，牠能滲透過五十七米突的水和五米突的鉛，毫無疑義，牠即被認爲一種電磁波，其波長比Ｘ光還短得多呢，依據愛因斯坦相對論上「質能換算公式」密氏發現氫氣變氦時，在此變化中所失的物質，恰可放射和宇宙光同長的光波，那是多麽有意的巧合啊！并且此光滲透地球外氣層，當被漸漸吸收，强度漸減，可知六英里以上的高空中（同温層）當爲良好的試騐塲所，而其光强度亦要隨離地遠近而異，畢氏各次上升，爲的是覘取此種假設是否在確，他實騐的結果，一方面想必可與「質能互換説」一新左證，同時那震驚一世的相對論，也受其證明或打擊，</p>
<p>（二）對氣象學上的貢獻，在氣象學上，尤其在天電研究上，畢教授的實騐，將有其重大的意義，同温層種種測候既爲其一端，而與宇宙光相關的天電研究乃其另一方面，地球表面的空氣，絶緣性很大，可是也有相當而可量的傅電性，乃因（一）氧分子和氣分子中電子的游移，丨氣體電離現象（二）地球含敖射性物質的作用，但是合上述二者，其能力尚覺不足造成空氣中現有電離程度，所以Ｍilkan便認宇宙光爲其第三種原因，畢教授這次所研究爲宇宙光的性質，所以對此方面多少有些校正和貢獻，</p>
<p>（三）天文學上的貢獻天體由來尤其太陽系起原到現在還是一個科學上之謎，和「生命原始」一問題可謂同其神秘，雖然有星雲説，流星説和星團説三種解答，各有其不完美的處，先説太陽罷，牠是一團火熱的物質，不斷地放射能力到地球和别的行星上去，可是照牠最短的壽命推算，即使牠純爲鐳錠組成，也早該死滅，惟一適當的解答，又爲「能質互變」一假説了，畢氏數次升天，可證能質互變一説的可靠程度，連帶地可解决太陽和他種天體諸問題，就是説這宇宙光是否發自太陽，或發自宇宙問的某一處，於是可依此新論據，進而推究太陽，或太陽的原始了，</p>
<p>總之，畢氏一人不願安安逸逸地領年俸過刻板的生活，而願意受冰凉蒸熱之苦，冒不測之險，他個人之精神當甚可欽服，而歐州人民之熱誠亦可贊美，同時滬上新聞界對此事，也頗注重，大字揭登，其現象亦可喜，</p>

<h3 id="c64">建議改良乳母案 <a href="#c64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>— 亢石</p>
<p>在我國中等以上的家庭，因爲有了錢抱着享福主義，所以撫育子女，大都僱乳母代之，可是：此種乳母，大概都是粗陋之輩，未受教育，未免教施失當，流弊滋生，後患無窮啊！</p>
<p>大凡兒童時代的教施，最爲重要，因爲一個人的品行好劣，全在童年時代的薰染，家長教施適當，才有好子弟，教施不適當，就造成了劣子弟，好像一間工廠，有了好機器，才有好的出品啊！</p>
<p>我曾見到許多有錢的家庭，都僱了乳母，可是：有些因爲小兒和乳母體質不合，以致小兒患了衰弱等症，何等的危險！而且：在未受教育的乳母教施之下，當然：小兒習到了少爺化，頽敗化，這非但是家庭的不良現象，並且是社會的危機。所以我把乳母的弊害，以及改良的建議，寫在下面，是否有當？還要請高明的指示一下</p>
<p>！</p>
<p>一·體質方面一個人有一個人的體質，丨熱和寒的不同。在一般僱乳母的人，只知乳母的身體健壯和乳水充足就好了，却不去考察體質方面，是否合宜？往往乳母的身體非常健壯，乳水非常充足，而小兒方面，却未見肥碩，或者瘦弱異常，這就是體質方面的不合。所以鄙意要改良一下，最好不僱乳母，自己哺乳，因爲母子間的體質，是天然的連帶關係，不要抱着享福主義犧牲了小兒！假使不這樣呢！也應當領乳母到醫師處，細細地騐一下，是否合宜？那麽：不致廢生意外了。</p>
<p>二·教施方面一般僱乳母的人同，把小兒交給乳母，自己却終日優游，試問乳母的看護，當然：不及自己的體貼入微，而且：做乳母的大多未受教育，她們唯一的主義，是唯聽小兒之意，因爲她們爲着生計問題，處處迎合主人的心理，不使小兒的啼哭聲，聞於主人，所以小兒的一切要求，玩具呀！糖果呀！莫不迎意供給，不敢稍拂，因之養成了小兒的盛氣，漸漸地養成了驕態，連父母的命令都不聽從，這就是俗諺説的少爺脾氣吧！所以鄙意要改良一下，做主人的常常警告乳母，不可縱容小兒無理的要求，應加嚴責，並且：聽見了小兒的啼聲，也不可妄責乳母，那麽：子弟不致養成少爺脾氣了。</p>
<p>唉！</p>
<h3 id="c65">一個大學生 <a href="#c65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>— 一萍</p>
<p>Ｗ君，他是一個大學生，他有一切摩登的特徵，多量的金錢，時髦的西裝，但是他認爲終生遺憾的是父母給他一個不圓整的腦袋，及一隻不大好看的臉兒，不過他抱定「人定可以勝天」「佛要金裝，人要衣裝」的格言，努力在化裝學上研究，每一個星期六日非犧牲二小時的化裝工夫不可，他的一隻抽頭裏像法租界的一言堂，剃刀，夏士蓮·孩兒面·施丹康·白衣神·木梳：：甚於女人出門時放在皮篋内的KissPrllf，他也老實不客氣的越界築路，備而大用，</p>
<p>但是天不可憐，無論如何他的手灣裏没有見過一個摩登狗兒。</p>
<p>於是他退而求其次，只要在畫報上，或者什麽地方，看見XXX女士，X女校高材生字樣，就不顧利害，肉麻當有趣的情書連一接二的寫去，直到自己覺得不好意思，才另尋箭靶，但是他的工作像長期抵抗一樣，效力等於零。</p>
<p>最後他異想天開，在無聊小報上大做艶情詩，他想藉此捧捧心目中的狗兒而使她垂青，什麽可愛的女人啊！你妖冶而肉感，你有白晳的臉，你有血紅的唇，高聳的乳房，粗圓的大腿，這都是你健美的象徵，啊！可愛的女人，你也感到性的煩悶。一時「色情狂」的口號，使許多未來的女學士，聯名請校長開除，一紙判决晝下來，照准。</p>
<p>在臨走的晚上，他宴請許多同學，酒席上居然大發慷慨激昻的演説詞，「諸位，我痛心中國的淪亡在即，而在上者一無辦法，你想讀書有什麽用？所以我追求女人，暫時麻木我的神經，要知道做亡國奴多麽慘痛？現在：：：」他舉起一個大拳頭向空中一揮，眞像一個殺敵的軍官演説一樣，「我的夢醒了！今天是們最後的一面，我到東北去，加入義勇軍，爲主義而戰，爲民族而亡，諸位，誰願加入的舉起手來，」但是祇見他的拳頭在空中一伸一縮</p>
<p>一禮拜後，他的大名又在某野雞大學發現，面且他的艶詩在某小報仍源源登載，屜頭中的化裝品多了一柄小鉗子，及一盒外國字的東西。</p>

<h3 id="c66">講習會一瞥 <a href="#c66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>— 金</p>
<p>八月X日至八月XX日，這是XX縣XX講習會開會的時候，會塲在XX，地點很是適中，交通很是便利，這中</p>
<p>間講習的時間，雖僅僅十五日，但是在這短短的十五天中間，也發生好幾件笑</p>
<p>話呢，兹摘録如下：</p>
<p>（一）聽講病有好幾個會員，他們來的目的，是爲吃飯，因爲他們是供給膳宿的，所以對於聽講是很隨便，一聽到鐘聲以後，有好幾個會員好好躺在床上，這個説頭痛啊，那個説腹痛啊，他又説發痧啊，弄得主持者没有辦法，等到講好以後，他們的病也慢慢地好了，尤其到了吃飯的時候，他們雖然生病，但是仍舊要吃三四碗呢？</p>
<p>（二）逃學XX講習會的會員，都是小學教員的先生們，年輕的也有二十多歲，年大的己有四五十歲了，而講的講師呢？年紀也很輕，相形之下，未免有些慚愧，丨這或許是我的猜度丨於是大家在聽到中途，便一個個地溜出去了，這是常見的事實。</p>
<p>（三）女同志有一天從XX地方來了幾位女同志，鵝蛋色的臉兒，細柔的身條，摩登的服裝，頓時引起了全會大部份會員的注意，這幾位女同志呢？也算承他們不棄，也聽了一小時講，這一小時呢？人馬到是濟濟一堂，連患聽講病的朋友們，居然也霍然而愈了，但是他們聽講的目的倒底何在。</p>
<p>唉！這就是XX講習會的大概。</p>
<p>墮落</p>
<h3 id="c67">摩女的生活 <a href="#c67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>— 金龍</p>
<p>我有位女朋友「她是XX初中的畢業生，她和我分别，將近二年了，昨天我偶然在所謂神秘之街遇到她，一度的談話，我知道他在靶子路XX按摩院，當着神秘的摩女子，</p>
<p>我説；「麗！好久不見咧，你好啊。」</p>
<p>她説「説也慚愧，我自從XX學校畢業，因老父見背，再不能上進求學一時又找不到相當的職業，不瞞你説，我眞慚愧，我現在在XX按摩院當摩女呢！」</p>
<p>「喲！摩女」我聽了當摩女三字，心裏覺得怪難受似的，我的理想中，按摩院是一種極神秘的麽窟，也許是變相的：：」</p>
<p>她説「我是墮落了！可是我也顧不了羞恥，你是知道的，我家裏祇有唯一的慈母，我要維持母女的生活，不得己而做那些下賤的句當，你得原諒我的苦衷，」</p>
<p>我説「那末你在那裏每月的薪水多少？」</p>
<p>她説「可憐得很，我非但没有薪水，並且也没有折賬的份兒，一切的利益，都結院主佔去了，摩女們的生活，全仗顧客們的賞賜，至於賞賜的代價，我可不願説了。」</p>
<p>她説罷，禁不住流着慚愧的偉大的熱涙，我也爲她掬着同情之涙，我便在悲哀中與她分袂，阿！摩女。可憐的摩女！</p>

(Special dispatch on the 27th) Japanese Chargé d'Affaires Yano Arrives in Nanjing Yesterday To Discuss Shanghai Business Issues Ario Claims It's a Courtesy Visit (Nanjing) Japanese Chargé d'Affaires Yano arrived in Nanjing by ship on the morning of the 27th and immediately visited Foreign Minister Luo at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with Counselor Ario and Consul Kamimura. They were received by Vice Minister Liu Chongjie and Director of the Asian Affairs Department Shen Jindin. It is reported that they discussed Shanghai business issues. According to Ario, Yano's visit to Nanjing is purely a private courtesy call and does not involve any official business. He will stay for about three or four days, discuss with Foreign Minister Luo and other key figures of the central government, and then return to Beiping. The newly appointed Japanese Ambassador to China, Arima, is expected to arrive in China around September 5th. Regarding the rumors that Japan and Russia have reached an understanding on the issue of the Northeast, they are completely inaccurate. American officials and the public have different views on the Manchurian issue, with some expressing sympathy for Japan's actions and others opposing them. The movements of the American fleet are a matter of military affairs, and I am not privy to that information. However, the talk of a war between Japan and the United States is practically impossible. Although the United States and France have expressed their views on the Kellogg-Briand Pact, Japan believes that it is not violating the pact. Japan's diplomatic policy of preparing to recognize Manchukuo is firmly established and unwavering. The Japanese government has already decided on the steps for recognition. This policy is completely separate from the Lytton Report. Regardless of the Lytton Report's opinion on Manchuria, Japan will not change its policy. If the Lytton Report has significant conflicts with Japanese policy, the Japanese government will make a final statement. As for the boycott movement in Shanghai, the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai has protested to the Mayor of Shanghai and received a reply from Mayor Wu. The Japanese side is still considering and studying the reply. The rumor that the Japanese side intends to use force to deal with it is completely untrue. (Special dispatch on the 27th) (Nanjing) Japanese Chargé d'Affaires Yano arrived here from Shanghai this morning and soon visited the Asian Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Yano is scheduled to meet with Foreign Minister Luo tomorrow, and it is said that he will inform him that this trip to Beijing is purely a matter of courtesy, as it is his first visit to Beijing since taking office as Chargé d'Affaires. The newly appointed Japanese Ambassador Arima will arrive in Shanghai on September 4th, after which Yano will return to Peiping, hence he is taking advantage of this time to come to Beijing to pay a formal visit to the authorities to officially announce the arrival date of the new ambassador. According to outside sources, Yano's visit to Beijing is to lodge a serious protest against the revival of the boycott of Japanese goods, but Reuters has learned from responsible sources that there is no basis for this claim, and that Yano does not intend to make any protests during this trip. (Reuters dispatch on the 27th) (Nanjing) Acting Ambassador Yano arrived in Nanjing at 10:00 this morning with First Secretary Ario, traveling on the Nisshin Xiangyang Maru. Ambassador Yano told reporters that this trip to Beijing was to meet with Foreign Minister Luo and other key figures of the National Government to convey his congratulations on his appointment, and to use this opportunity to make various contacts before returning to Beiping after taking office in Shanghai, and that he has no special diplomatic mission. He plans to stay for one or two days and then return to Shanghai. (Telecommunications Agency dispatch on the 27th) League of Nations Investigation Team Decides to Leave Beiping in Three Groups The Report Will Be Completed by the End of the Month Chinese Government's Memorandum Draft Completed (Beiping) The Investigation Team has decided to complete the report by the end of the month. The members have contacted our government to arrange their departure itinerary from Beiping, and it has been decided to depart in three groups. (1) Gu Weijun and his secretaries will go to Beijing on the 1st to contact the authorities, and arrive in Shanghai around the 4th to take a ship. (2) The representatives of Germany, Italy, and France will leave the pass from Beiping on the 2nd via the Beining Line, transfer to the pseudo-Fengshan Railway to Harbin, and then travel to Geneva via Siberia. (3) Lytton, along with American representative Mr. and Mrs. Macoy and Haas, will take a Ford aircraft to Shanghai to meet with Gu and others, and then take the Italian postal ship departing from Shanghai on the 5th to Geneva. Gu Weijun, in his new capacity as the French Ambassador, will first go to Paris after arriving in Italy and stay for one or two days before going to Geneva. The reception office of the League of Nations Investigation Team in Beiping has received a telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stating that it will be closed by the end of the month. (Special dispatch on the 27th) (Beiping) The report of the Lytton Investigation Team is nearing completion. The full text will be no less than 100,000 words and will form a large volume. The conclusion will be left to the final step, so outside speculation about the content of the conclusion is too early. After the report is completed, it will be sent to Geneva, but the route has not yet been decided. It is said that some investigators will leave Beiping within a week and make a final decision on the fastest route back to Europe. The hesitation is partly due to the current floods in the three northeastern provinces, which may make the route through Siberia inconvenient. Lord Lytton, after returning from Japan, was plagued by illness. Although he has recovered, his health has not fully returned. Therefore, his return to Europe by sea is almost certain. It is now believed that he will take the Italian ship Conte Verde. The remaining investigators, if it is confirmed that the Siberian Railway is difficult to pass at that time, will also return on the same ship as Lord Lytton. According to members of the Investigation Team, the report is very long and will not be submitted to the League of Nations Council until the end of September at the earliest. At that time, a temporary edition can be printed without the attachments. The League of Nations has long-standing relationships with several printing companies in Geneva and Lausanne and will likely distribute the report to these companies for typesetting so that it can be completed as soon as possible. (Reuters dispatch on the 27th) (Beiping) The Chinese government's memorandum to the League of Nations, consisting of 27 types and more than 20,000 copies, has been drafted by Gu and completed. It will be transported to Geneva. Seven boxes have already been shipped on the 26th, and 18 boxes are being packed and will be shipped to Shanghai within a day or two. The Northeast Diplomatic Committee also has several types of memoranda, totaling seven boxes. (Special dispatch on the 27th) (Beiping) The offices of the representatives in the Investigation Team will be closed by the end of this month.

(Special dispatch on the 27th) Reasons for the Abandonment of Opium Prohibition in Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou (Nanjing) A senior official of the Opium Prohibition Association said that the opium prohibition in various provinces has been abandoned recently, and the anti-drug campaign has become empty talk, especially in Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces. The main reason is that transportation in these three provinces is blocked, and surplus agricultural products cannot be sold to other provinces, causing farmers' economies to suffer greatly. The only way to make a profit and not worry about unsold products is to plant poppies, which is a supreme remedy for absorbing money. No matter how strict the prohibition is, the will of officials and the people to uphold the law will ultimately not be able to overcome the desire for profit. Therefore, the fundamental solution to the opium prohibition work in these three provinces is to open up transportation, such as the early completion of the Sichuan-Hankou and Yunnan-Sichuan roads, so that agricultural products can be fully circulated to the outside world, farmers will not be trapped, and they can gradually reduce the planting of poppies and switch to grain crops. The results of the opium prohibition can be improved invisibly. Otherwise, where there is great profit, people will compete for it, and there will never be a day to eradicate it.

<p>▲ Public Security Bureau Inspector Injured in Assault</p>
<p>Recently, a group of prostitutes from Changzhou, including Xiao Sanmei and Xiuzhen, have been loitering in hotels in Cheng. At around 7 PM on the 25th, a patron, Qian, and others took the prostitutes from the Huayuan Hotel to the Zhaoshang Hotel. Suddenly, a person from out of town, identified as Jia, became jealous and reported the incident to the Public Security Bureau. Inspector Zhao Yuting was dispatched to handle the matter. During the course of the investigation, a misunderstanding occurred, and a conflict erupted. Zhao was dragged into the street by five or six people speaking with a Jiangxi accent and severely beaten with rattan canes. He was immediately transported to Jiangyin Hospital for treatment. During the chaos, nearby shops, suspecting an incident, closed early, causing widespread disorder. Although the Public Security Bureau dispatched over ten officers to arrest the assailants, they were confronted at the Rainbow Bridge and forced to retreat, resulting in the escape of all the perpetrators. On the 26th, Zhao's injuries worsened, with increased pain in his chest and back, raising concerns about his life.

<p>▲ Squad Leader Accused of Colluding with Bandits: Case Transferred to Provincial Authorities</p>
<p>Zhou Lushan, the squad leader, and Chen Gang, the deputy squad leader, of the Dalan Mountain Reconnaissance Squad jointly administered by the governments of Yin, Feng, and Ci counties, were appointed by Wu Conglong, the former commander of the 3rd Regiment of the Security Forces, over a year ago. Recently, the Provincial Security Department received a confidential report alleging that the squad leader and deputy squad leader were suspected of colluding with bandits. The department immediately ordered Yang Zhiqu, the battalion commander of the 2nd Battalion of the 6th Regiment, to arrest them. Upon receiving the order, the battalion commander led soldiers to Dalan Mountain the day before yesterday, disarmed the entire squad, and detained the squad leader and deputy squad leader, Zhou Lushan and Chen Gang, transferring them to the provincial authorities for investigation.</p>
<p>▲ Mother and Son Reunited After Thirty-Nine Years</p>
<p>Li Jiangshi, a resident of Li Hongmao Lane on the north bank of the Yongpu River, is currently 65 years old. She has two sons, the elder named Arong and the younger named Agui. Thirty-nine years ago, on the first day of the eleventh month of the lunar calendar, Li Jiangshi's aunt took Agui to the Sheshijun Temple to watch a play. A sudden fire broke out in the temple, and Agui, then five years old, was separated from his grandmother in the chaos. He was tricked and sold to Zhang Shouchang from Sushan as an adopted son. Zhang owned the Zhengchang Rice Shop at the Dongmenkou in Xiapu County, Fujian Province, and took Agui to Fujian. As he grew older, due to the decline of the family's fortunes, Agui returned to Shao to work as a partner in a tin shop. In February of this year, Agui went to Fujian again to work at Zhao Deli Clock Shop in Zhangzhou. Although Agui traveled back and forth between the two provinces, he always remembered his birth mother. However, he only knew her surname was Li and did not know his father's name or the name of the place where they lived in Yongpu, so he could not come to Yongpu to find his relatives. His mother, Li Jiangshi, had been thinking of Agui very much for thirty years. This spring, she entrusted a relative working in a bank in Xiamen to place a missing person advertisement in a newspaper in Xiamen. In March of this year, the Communists disturbed Zhangzhou, and Agui fled to Xiamen. He unintentionally read the missing person advertisement placed by Li Jiangshi, was overjoyed, and immediately wrote a letter to his birth mother, Li Jiangshi. The day before yesterday, he arrived in Shanghai from Xiamen and took a boat to Yongpu. Upon asking for the house in Li Hongmao Lane and meeting his old mother, they were overcome with grief and joy and embraced each other and cried bitterly. Mother and son have been separated for over thirty-nine years and suddenly reunited, truly a rare and extraordinary event in society.</p>

<h3 id="e2">Another Setback at National Central University <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<h3 id="e3">New President Luo Jialun Firmly Declines the Position <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<h3 id="e4">Students Demand School Opening Without Placement Exams <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Because the former president refused to take on the difficult task of cleaning up the affairs of the dispersed university, a new president was found. After taking the office, he realized that the job was too difficult and decided to decline the offer, leaving the university without a leader and the students delayed in their studies. Several hundred students, represented by Xu Dehua and four others, took a petition to the Ministry of Education on the morning of the 26th, stating three demands: (1) Determine the opening date of the school as soon as possible to avoid prolonged delay in studies. (2) Change the placement exam to a placement registration, and make up the missed courses from the last semester after the school opens. (If placement exams are held again, first, the previous studies will be erased if the placement exam is failed, which is unacceptable; second, the disturbance was caused by a few students, and the majority should not be hindered by the minority; third, if the placement exam is failed, the grades given by the professors in the past will not be counted, which not only distrusts the professors but also concerns the personality of the faculty and students.) (3) Request the opening of the dormitories (only the second, fourth, and fifth dormitories are currently open; the first and third dormitories, which are more spacious, have not yet been opened) to avoid staying in hotels and facing economic hardship. Senior Secretary Tingzi of the Ministry of Education met with them and stated that the first point would be decided after the president is determined, the second point would be forwarded to the minister for consideration, and the third point was due to the fact that the general affairs section was repairing the dormitories and would be opened after completion. The student representatives, because the president's issue has not been resolved, and the opening of school is still uncertain, went to the Executive Yuan to petition, but did not get what they wanted. It is said that the Ministry of Education has expressed its intention to retain Luo Zhixi and hopes that Luo will reluctantly take on the difficult task, even if he is unwilling to take the position, he should temporarily transition it so that Central University has someone in charge and can prepare for the opening of school as soon as possible. Now some excellent professors at Central University have already taken other positions because Central University is indecisive. Time waits for no one, and September is approaching. Past reorganizations will get on track, and everyone will get rid of the old and start anew, but nothing has been achieved (such as the issues of the president, professors, placement, etc.). It is unknown how to end it well.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Party Department Sends a Telegram to the Central Government Requesting a Temporary Suspension of Changing the Party Ideology Course to a Civics Course</p>
<p>The National Society stated that recently, the Curriculum Standards Committee of the Ministry of Education decided to change Party Ideology to Civics in primary and secondary schools. The Municipal Party Department believes that now is the time for the opening of schools, and the Civics textbook has not yet been compiled, so it has petitioned the Central Government to temporarily maintain the status quo. The original telegram is recorded below: "Respectfully to the Nanjing Central Executive Committee: According to reports, the Curriculum Standards Committee of the Ministry of Education has decided to change Party Ideology to Civics. Without discussing the merits and demerits, it seems appropriate to maintain the status quo when the Civics curriculum standards have not yet been approved and the Civics textbook has not yet been compiled. Before the new standards are promulgated, the old regulations should be followed. Since some schools have changed Party Ideology to Civics, a special telegram is sent to request the Ministry of Education to issue a notice to all regions to temporarily suspend the change. The Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang respectfully asks."</p>

<p>Completion of Reconstruction of School Buildings at Chih Tze College</p>
<p>After the school buildings of the Chih Tze College and its affiliated middle school were burned down by Japanese soldiers, He Shizhen, the principal of the school, devoted himself to rebuilding the college buildings on Shuishui Road. The reconstruction has now been completed, with a brand new appearance and a magnificent view. The details of the school are listed below: "Construction and Equipment" A three-story dormitory can accommodate over a thousand people. A two-story classroom, a large auditorium, an office building, a dining hall, a library, and a sports field have all been completed. New sanitary equipment has been installed. All classrooms and dormitories are equipped with heating pipes. All water and electricity are supplied by the school's own water pump and generator. "Departments and Programs" The original English Department, Political Science Department, and Group A Commerce Department, which were temporarily suspended due to the war last semester, have all been reopened. The Commerce Department has been divided into four groups: Banking, Accounting, International Trade, and Business Administration. The Law Department of the Faculty of Law has been divided into two groups, A and B, due to the large number of students. Group A has classes at the university department on Shuishui Road, while Group B is located in the middle school department and has classes starting at 6:00 PM. The curriculum is the same. Professors for each department have been hired and are all well-known figures in Shanghai. "Affiliated Middle School" The middle school department of the school is still located in the concession. A large building at 56 Hede Road has been rented, and three houses have been rented nearby for use as dormitories. The teaching is in accordance with the original plan. "Enrollment and School Opening" The second round of enrollment for the school has seen a very enthusiastic response. The entrance exams will be held on September 5th and 6th, and the school opening is scheduled for September 12th.</p>

<p>Sports</p>
<p>My Views on "The Future of National Sports" By Wu Yunrui</p>
<p>I read the article "The Future of National Sports" in the August 7th issue of the Ta Kung Pao and understand its main points, which are nothing more than two: first, competitive sports are harmful to health, time-consuming, and costly, implying that they should be abolished; second, local sports save time and money, prevent illness, and prolong life, achieving the purpose of defending the country and managing property. The validity of these conclusions is questionable and I would like to analyze them in detail.</p>
<p>1. The Issue of Competitive Sports Harming Health</p>
<p>In the modern age of scientific development, all conclusions must have a scientific basis, whether based on experiments in natural sciences or statistics in social sciences. Sports belongs to both social and natural sciences, so various issues in sports must be resolved through experimental statistical methods. Those with a little scientific knowledge agree with this. However, the conclusion in the article that "competitive sports are harmful to health" is based on the death of Jin Jianjuan. If this conclusion were credible, then Japan would have completely abolished competitive sports. However, the fact that this has not happened shows that this conclusion is incorrect. The death of Jin Jianjuan was an exceptional case in sports, occupying a position at the extremes of the normal curve in statistics. Statisticians often ignore it, but the reporter of the newspaper used it as a conclusion, revealing a lack of statistical basis. If we take the current situation of sports in Germany as an example to prove it, then it will be even more inappropriate. After the Great War, Germany was restricted by the Allied countries from training soldiers. The government had no choice but to vigorously promote sports, with competitive sports as the main item. Regardless of gender, they received the same training. Every morning and evening, in secluded streets, young men and women were often seen practicing running. If competitive sports really had drawbacks, with Germany's excellent medical science and good equipment, how could it not have been discovered? Therefore, the reporter's statement, The total statistics of national social education in the eighteenth year (1)</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education previously investigated the social education undertakings in the country in the 18th year (from July of the 18th year to June of the 19th year) and has now compiled the statistics. The following is an excerpt from the report.</p>

<p>(First Half of the Year)</p>
<p>Total 64232 13030374851203136160</p>
<p>The phrase "examine health" is enough to prove that there is no definite evidence. The physical educators in our country now take the popularization of physical education as a common goal. Does the teaching material used only include competitive sports? Most of those who advocate focusing on competitive sports are a small number of people who do not understand physical education. It is not a disease of physical educators. Among the sports implementation plans passed by the National Sports Conference, there is a section on performance appraisal, the purpose of which is to examine the mass sports achievements of schools and cities, which is to correct the shortcomings of a few people engaged in competition and is in line with the reporter's intention.</p>
<p>2. The Issue of Time Consumption</p>
<p>No country values time more than the United States. An hour of work can earn an average of more than one US dollar. In addition to work time, the rest of the time is used for sports and games to relax the mind. According to the reporter's opinion, isn't this a waste of time? The reason why they reduce working hours and engage in sports and games is that people's energy is limited. The result of one person working continuously for four hours is not as good as the result of someone who takes breaks in between. As society and culture advance, there will be more leisure time, which is natural. In this time of national crisis, all citizens should work hard, which goes without saying. However, the purpose of work is to seek excellent results, and whether the results are good or bad is not directly proportional to the length of working hours, which has long been proven and does not need to be elaborated on. Therefore, to seek excellence in work, it is also necessary to engage in games and sports to regulate mental fatigue and forget the pain of work.</p>
<p>3. The Issue of Economics</p>
<p>Regardless of the type of sports activity, except for gymnastics, the reporter believes that Mr. Liu Changchun's attendance at the World Olympics is solid proof that competitive sports are costly, which is inappropriate. Mr. Liu's attendance this time had a political meaning. If the "Manchukuo" faction dispatched him to attend, it would not be possible. Using a random event as the basis for argument is the same error as hearing of Mr. Jin Jianjuan's death and thinking that sports competitions are harmful to health.</p>
<p>4. Local Sports Prevent Illness and Prolong Life</p>
<p>Modern health education is very developed, and the effect of preventing illness and prolonging life depends on it. Therefore, the art of preventing illness and prolonging life is by no means limited to physical exercise. The reporter's claim to seek national art in local sports is well-founded and seems to have a profound meaning. It is unknown what it is based on. If it is based solely on traditional rhetoric, it may not be credible.</p>
<p>As far as I can see, the future path of national sports will be determined by the following two points:</p>
<p>A. Adapt to Individuality</p>
<p>Individuality is a condition that cannot be ignored in education. Russell advocates this most strongly. The materials used in sports must be suitable for the individuality of children. Our nation has primitive ancestors, who lived in nests and caves, ate raw meat and drank blood. All the instincts of running, jumping, throwing, and chiseling were possessed by our ancestors early on. For thousands of years, they have been deeply rooted in our minds. If you observe elementary school children after school, they gather on the playground and either run or jump. The inheritance of the activities of our ancestors is reappearing in the activities of today's children. What the reporter refers to as foreign sports is actually the remains of the activities of our ancestors. Why do foreigners exist? Because humans are the same, all activities that are in line with their nature are local and not foreign. On the contrary, Swedish gymnastics and German gymnastics do not conform to the nature of children. European and American children abandon them, and our children also hate them deeply. For Europeans and Americans, they are local but also foreign; for us, they are foreign and also foreign. Therefore, it is useless to advocate sports that do not suit the individuality of children, but it is not obedient to prohibit those that do. Foreign sports are foreign, but local sports are also true.</p>
<p>B. Adapt to Society</p>
<p>The life of an individual is entrusted to society. The prosperity and decline, strength and weakness of society are related to the individual. Therefore, the individual must sometimes accommodate society. During the recent Songhu War, the Great Sword Team bravely killed the thieves, and the voice of national art saving the country has since become higher. Its position in sports may be more solid from now on. However, modern international wars rely entirely on science. If the enemy uses planes and artillery to bomb, the great sword will be able to use its skills. Therefore, in order to adapt to the environment and defend the country in the future, we should train soldiers with both intelligence and courage, and cultivate the skills of running, jumping, and climbing. However, this relies on games, ball games, equipment, and track and field sports, which can only be achieved through this. National arts and war are alone.</p>
<p>In the above two points, the former is an economic one and the latter is a balance of rights. In order to be more economical, economic must always be maintained, and the powers can be changed. Abandoning the economic and following the rights will be futile. It is difficult to save time and money. With the author's goal of this or to violate the road and run, compelled by the true righteousness, I dare not be silent. I have made this article to chat for correction.</p>
<p>The 20th Army Volleyball Team Loses to Lingnan</p>
<p>Defeated in Three Consecutive Games</p>
<p>▲ Basketball Battle Tonight</p>
<p>▲ At the China Basketball Hall at 7 PM</p>
<p>The volleyball team of the Sichuan 20th Army Expeditionary Force played a friendly match with the Lingnan volleyball team in this city at the China Athletic Field yesterday afternoon. Although they tried hard, they lost three consecutive games due to slightly inferior skills: 21-14, 21-11, 21-6. The referee was Wei Dingyi.</p>
<p>▲ Fierce Battle in the First Game</p>
<p>The 20th Army served first, but lost points due to excessive force. Lingnan took the lead with 4-1. The guest team resisted with great effort, resulting in a difficult and inseparable situation: 6-6, 7-7. Lingnan won the first half with 11-9, then continued to win with 19-11. The Sichuan Army fought fiercely, but lost the first game with 21-14.</p>
<p>▲ Great Decline in Morale in the Second and Third Games</p>
<p>At the start of the second game, the Sichuan Army adopted a steady approach, trying to slow down the pace. However, they still lost the first half with 11-5 due to the opponent's fierce attack and defensive errors. Lingnan won the second game with 21-11. In the third game, their morale declined further, losing the first half with only three points and a score of 21-6.</p>
<p>▲ Observations on the Guest Team's Skills</p>
<p>The Sichuan Army's performance can be described as follows: (1) Poor teamwork; (2) Uneven talent; (3) Unskilled ball rescue; (4) Many serving errors. The lack of teamwork made it impossible for the offense and defense to be unified. In terms of talent, the center forward and the front row were the most outstanding, but the two flanks and the back row could not provide assistance and rescue, resulting in isolation. The inability to save dangerous balls and the failure to kill the opponent with the ball were also reasons for the defeat. The wind was quite strong yesterday, making it difficult to hit the ball. The Sichuan Army's serve was not accurate and failed to change its tactics according to the wind, resulting in many lost points, which was a pity. Lingnan's performance showed frequent chaotic crowding, which was average. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ 20th Army</p>
<p>Front Row Middle Row Back Row</p>
<p>Zhang Hongyu Wen Ni Hua Zhang Li Xin</p>
<p>Yang Jialin Chou Xi Gu Cao Bangcheng</p>
<p>Lou Huazhang Zeng Fusheng Yin Li</p>
<p>▲ Lingnan Team</p>
<p>Peng Guangxin Ling Hongzhao Guan Jinlun</p>
<p>Liang Dingchao Chen Jiongjian Zhu Zhicheng</p>
<p>Chen Songlin Chen Guanyou Gan Zhongrong</p>
<p>▲ Basketball Battle Tonight</p>
<p>The army's basketball team will show their skills tonight at 7 PM, playing against the Hufeng basketball team in their first performance at the China Basketball Hall. The referee is Zhang Wugao.</p>
<p>▲ Will Visit Hangzhou Again</p>
<p>According to the army, they will stay in Shanghai for about three weeks for the competition, and then visit Hangzhou for a tour of West Lake in addition to the competition.</p>
<p>Jiang Daozhang Discusses New Trends in the Tennis World</p>
<p>▲ Qiu Feihai's Arrival in Shanghai is Uncertain</p>
<p>▲ Zheng Zhaojia Has Good Hope for a Championship</p>
<p>Recently, this newspaper published an interview with Lin Baohua, saying that Qiu Feihai would arrive in Shanghai on the 26th. This newspaper reporter visited Lin at the China Tennis Court yesterday but did not meet him. However, he met Jiang Daozhang, Jiang is a close friend of Qiu. Asked whether Qiu has arrived in Shanghai, he said that he thought Qiu had arrived in Hong Kong and had telegraphed twice to inquire, but there was no reply. Although Qiu signed up for the open tennis advanced singles competition, he was afraid that he would not make it in time and would have to give up. Jiang also talked about the situation of the open advanced singles competition in this year's grass tennis, and his vision must be better than others. It is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ New Valuation of Lin Qiu's Skills</p>
<p>If Qiu Feihai cannot come to Shanghai to participate in the open singles, I (Jiang called himself below) can meet Lin Baohua in the rematch. I think that even if Mr. Qiu comes to Shanghai, he may not have good results, because he is over thirty years old and his physique is weak. After a plate, he feels tired. Since his strength is not enough, the ball is soft and weak. As for Lin Baohua's tennis skills this year, it seems that there has been some progress, but he does not practice diligently, and his endurance is not enough. Because of his age and physique, he no longer wants to compete with others. He only likes to play and entertain himself.</p>
<p>▲ Zheng Zhaojia is Indeed Likable</p>
<p>Zheng Zhaojia practices very diligently, and his tennis skills have improved rapidly. He has confidence in various hitting methods, and the ball is sharp and fast, with very few mistakes. In addition, he is young and strong, and even if he plays five tough games, he does not feel tired. This time, he has great hope for the advanced singles championship. Qiu Feihai and Lin Baohua may not be able to defeat him. Even if De Fu's ball is slow and not as sharp as Zheng's, he may not be able to beat Zheng. Mr. Zheng is indeed likable, and so on.</p>
<p>Summer Soccer: Taiping Wins the Right to the Inter-Trade Cup Final</p>
<p>Defeats Postal Service 2-0 Yesterday</p>
<p>The Lingnan A and Yuequn Teams Win in the Joint League</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were three groups of summer soccer games. The Father Road was quite lively. In the league, Lingnan A defeated Zhihua 5-0, and Yuequn defeated Lingnan B 4-0. Another game was the Inter-Trade Cup semi-final between Taiping and Postal Service. As a result, Taiping won 4-0 and won the right to the final.</p>
<p>The Postal Service has average talent and remarkable skills. The Taiping team only relies on two or three generals such as Chen Jiaqiu, Feng Yunyou, and Chen Yutian, who are all first-class players in Shanghai. It is natural to be overshadowed by a new team trying to fight against heroes who have fought on the battlefield for a hundred battles. However, the Postal Service's performance can still win the cheers of the audience. In the first half, Taiping first won a penalty kick, which was kicked in by Chen Yutian. Later, Chen Jiaqiu scored a goal, and in the afternoon, both Chen scored a goal each, resulting in a score of 4-0.</p>
<p>A total of six teams joined the Inter-Trade Cup. In the preliminary round, the Postal Service defeated the Land 2-1, and Huabu defeated Zhonghua 1-0. Yesterday, in the semi-final, Taiping defeated the Postal Service. Another game was between Huabu and Bubu, which will be played next week. The winner will play against Taiping in the final.</p>
<p>There are three summer soccer games today</p>
<p>Team Names, Group, Time and Venue, Referee</p>
<p>Huadong vs. Youth, Group Two, 5:00 PM, Baseball Field, He Chunhui</p>
<p>Starlight vs. Qiangnan, Group One, 3:30 PM, Soccer Field, Tang Zhongguang</p>
<p>Qinghua vs. Dajiang, Group One, 5:00 PM, Star Field, Lu Gefu</p>
<p>(Note) The semi-final between Biefa and Huabu will be held at 5:00 PM tomorrow at the Baseball Field.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<p>A Branch of the Tanlu Vine Zhan Lu</p>
<p>The "twisting and pulling" in the mouths of Shanghai people, and the "only vines winding around trees, no trees winding around vines" in the mouths of Suzhou people, have now become proverbs. With a puppet state, there must be someone to twist the strings. Muteng went to the puppet state to be the supreme ruler. From then on, every move of the puppet ruler relied on this vine. Motivation: The puppet's silk is tied to the vine branch. If you want to twist the silk, you must pull the vine. This is called twisting and pulling.</p>
<p>China is like a lonely and helpless tree. After a long time, the surrounding branches and leaves are often exploited by the outside world and have no strength to resist. It's okay to just exploit the branches and leaves. Recently, there have been many wild vines that want to bind the tree</p>
<h3 id="e7">On the Attitude of the Great Powers Towards the Japanese Foreign Minister's Speech <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>If Japan truly makes a resolute decision, disregarding all good faith and treaties, then it would be honest to acknowledge this for the sake of the nation. If Japan retains even a slight consideration for good faith and treaties, then regardless of what it does, it will be impossible to justify its actions. If Japan resolutely destroys world peace and willingly disrupts the overall situation in East Asia, then recognizing the puppet state is permissible. Furthermore, advancing to attack Rehe, seize Pingjin, and even disturb the entire nation would also be acceptable. If Japan possesses even a slight concern for safeguarding peace and preserving the overall situation, then regardless of what it does, it will be difficult to justify its actions deviously. The speech given by Foreign Minister Uchida in the Diet stated that recognizing Manchuria is the only method to secure lasting peace in the Far East, that the chaos and revolution within China are the causes of unfortunate changes in international relations in the Far East, that the September 18th Incident was an act of self-defense and did not violate the Kellogg-Briand Pact, that the direct use of force to prevent the infringement of vested interests is a long-standing practice and did not originate with Japan, and that the establishment of the Manchurian state was the result of a separatist movement decided by local leaders, for which Japan bears no responsibility. Finally, he repeatedly declared that Japan has no ambitions for territorial expansion and does not intend to resolve the situation perfunctorily. The various points that contradict the facts are simply too numerous to mention and refute. His words are not only disbelieved by the Chinese people, but also by people from all over the world who are not naive and will not easily believe them. However, the purpose of Foreign Minister Uchida's lengthy statement before the League of Nations report is not to ensure that the great powers will necessarily believe him, but to express his firm and resolute attitude, to reject interference from Britain, the United States, and the League of Nations, to hint subtly at the great powers to see the situation and stop, and to threaten the great powers frankly so that they dare not act rashly. Therefore, the attitude of the great powers towards this statement is worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>According to foreign dispatches, both the British and American governments do not wish to express any opinion on this statement until the investigation team's report is submitted to the League of Nations, temporarily responding to Japan with a closed mouth. This is also because the matter is of great importance, and it is difficult to express an opinion without extremely careful consideration. Although British and American newspapers have mostly criticized and ridiculed the Japanese Foreign Minister's speech, they all conclude that the Japanese have violated the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which cannot be denied. However, we cannot deduce the psychology of the government authorities based on the general public's opinion. The international situation today and diplomatic means are complex and constantly changing, which cannot be predicted by outsiders in advance. What we can assert based on the facts is that the situation in East Asia today has reached a critical and dangerous point, and the calls for a second world war are becoming increasingly urgent. Once a spark ignites, it will immediately erupt. The fuse for this second world war is not in the hands of the Japanese, but in the hands of the British and American powers. The only thing that can sanction those who use force to invade other countries is public justice and righteousness. But it is not enough to sanction with empty words of public justice and righteousness, but only when the majority of powerful nations sincerely believe in this public justice and righteousness can it be sanctioned. If the majority of powerful nations can see that the opportunity cannot be missed, no matter how difficult and arduous, they must work together to maintain this public justice and righteousness. If one or two ambitious people want to use force to destroy our covenant to maintain public justice and righteousness, we should stand up and sanction them, even if they are intimidated, and not be afraid. Then the ambitious people will have to know the difficulty and retreat. Otherwise, if they hesitate and consider using perfunctory reconciliation as a solution, once they are exhausted and the crisis breaks, it will inevitably spread and overflow, and there will be no way to clean it up. Only then will they realize that a temporary peace is not a good plan, but it will be too late. Therefore, I say that those who hold the fuse for the outbreak of disaster today should seriously consider it in advance.</p>
<p>I say this not to borrow the strength of the British and American powers to save ourselves, nor to provoke the great powers to start a war with Japan for my own pleasure. My country is in a situation of military oppression and has long been prepared to be a sacrifice for the world. In today's situation, my country cannot but sacrifice. Even if a world war unfortunately occurs in the future, my country will only be sacrificed. It is a pity that once a war breaks out, it is not only my country that will be sacrificed. All countries in the world will suffer great turmoil. I do not know if the governments of the great powers are willing to abandon the painstaking efforts they have made over the years to promote peace and eliminate war. If not, then at this critical moment, they should have a way to deal with it.</p>

The badges were in four colors: red for the presidium, yellow for group representatives, pink for individual members, and white for staff. National flags were hung in the four corners of the venue, and slogans such as "Never Cooperate with Those Who Engage in Civil War" and "Abolishing Civil War is the Way to Find a Way Out for the Chinese Nation" were displayed. The atmosphere was very solemn. The seats were all marked with numbers, and attendees had to match their attendance certificate numbers to their seats in order, and the order was well maintained.</p>
<p>▲ Conference Staff: Presidium: Wang Xiaolai, Wu Daquan, Liu Zhan'en (the above three were nominated by the preparatory committee), Lin Kanghou, Chen Shucheng (Principal of Wuchang China University), Yang Meizhen (Deputy Executive Director of the Women's Temperance Society), Lu Zhangyuan (Guangdong Member).

<p>▲ Conference Proceedings: The meeting was announced to begin at 9 AM. Wang Xiaolai, the interim chairman, conducted the ceremony as usual. (1) Election of the Presidium. Wang Xiaolai reported first. The Presidium was stipulated to have seven members. Three had already been nominated by the preparatory committee. The remaining four were to be publicly elected by the conference. Xu Jiqian proposed the distribution of the four members, with the National Federation of Commerce, the women's sector, Wuhan, and Guangdong each occupying one member. Dai Tianqiu proposed that the Presidium nominate candidates according to the above criteria.

(2) Chairman Wu Daquan delivered the opening speech (recorded separately). (3) Chairman Lin Kanghou reported on the preparatory process (recorded separately). (4) Chairman Yang Meizhen had Secretary Director Yan Esheng read the declaration of establishment drafted by the preparatory committee, which was then voted on and passed. The original declaration is recorded separately. (5) Organization of the Proposal Review Committee. Chairman Wu Daquan explained that the Presidium would nominate candidates for the review committee and seek the consent of the conference. Dai Tianqiu objected to the review committee arbitrarily picking and choosing, which would erase the original proposers' intentions. The chairman explained that it was only for organizing and merging to facilitate discussion. The chairman then nominated 29 people, read out the list, and it was passed without dissent (list recorded separately). (6) Photography. (7) Representatives' Speeches. The chairman explained that each person should not exceed ten minutes. Afterwards, Huang Wenzhong and 13 others spoke in turn (the main points of the speeches are recorded separately).

In addition to the 55 items received earlier, which were included in the special issue compiled and printed by the National Federation of Commerce, more than 20 items were received later.

<h3 id="e11">Declaration Announcing Establishment <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>

As of today, those who support the charter of this association and have joined as initiators total 401 groups and 1,057 individuals. Geographically, they cover more than 20 provinces and major overseas cities. Professionally, they cover agriculture, industry, commerce, and education. We hereby solemnly declare the establishment of the Abolish Civil War Grand Alliance at a representative conference in Shanghai today. We hereby notify you by telegram. The Abolish Civil War Grand Alliance."</p>
<h3 id="e12">Compilation of Speeches and Reports <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>▲ Chairman's Speech: Chairman Wu Daquan delivered the opening speech, saying: "Gentlemen, today we are holding the representative conference of the Abolish Civil War Grand Alliance. We are grateful that representatives from various provinces and cities have arrived as scheduled, and many have come from afar despite the heat. The four groups that initially initiated this conference in Shanghai are extremely grateful. I am entrusted by the preparatory committee to explain the purpose of the conference to you, which is also a great honor. Gentlemen, what has China come to today? The enemy has occupied the land and people of our three provinces with a small number of troops, and there is nothing we can do. They have devastated our major commercial ports, taking numerous lives and destroying property, and there is nothing we can do. The situation in Rehe and Yubian is alarming again, and the scope of aggression is expanding without end. China, with its vast land, rich resources, and large population, is being trampled upon to this extent. We are truly heartbroken and tearful when we think about it. The reason for this is mostly due to the continuous civil wars of the past 20 years, which have only destroyed the country's wealth and the people's strength, resulting in weakness and stagnation, inviting this great foreign humiliation. This is an extremely clear fact, and there is no need to deny or doubt it. So we can see that everyone understands that the survival of our country and nation can only be achieved through unity against foreign aggression, by taking the path of long-term resistance. We now understand even more that to resist the enemy in the long term, we must first take the path of abolishing civil war. This is what everyone in the country has felt in their conscience since the September 18th Incident, and it is also the motive for the initiation of this conference. I am sure that everyone present here shares this sentiment, and I will not elaborate further. However, there are about three points that I would like to explain to you about the points to pay attention to in this movement. (1) This movement of ours is a universal movement of the people. Regardless of individual, group, gender, occupation, or party affiliation, we hope that they will join in order to have a great and rapid effect. The types of members need to be universal, so the goals of the movement must be as simple as possible. Anyone who agrees with the abolition of civil war can join this conference and work together on this common goal. Other differences in personal opinions and behaviors are not what this conference intends to ask about. Therefore, the charter of this conference stipulates, "This conference shall not engage in any other activities other than the movement to abolish civil war." The intention of this article is not to oppose other movements. There are many kinds of movements that are needed to eliminate the root causes of civil war, and this conference is well aware of this, and earnestly hopes that the members of this conference will gather together with those who share the same purpose to carry out various individual movements to assist or promote the success of this conference. However, in a movement of this conference with the commonality of the general public, it is necessary to set a simple and clear scope in order to avoid differences of opinion. Therefore, the charter also stipulates that "The movement of this conference to abolish civil war shall be carried out in the following order: (A) In peacetime, this conference shall issue public texts or speeches, stating the evils of civil war and explaining the benefits of peace. (B) If political disputes arise that are sufficient to cause civil war, this conference shall advise both parties to trust a certain public opinion organ (before a formal national representative organ is established, a statutory non-governmental professional body can replace it) to mediate, and neither party shall absolutely resolve it by force. (C) If civil war unfortunately occurs, the group members and individual members of this conference shall unanimously refuse to cooperate and shall adopt peaceful and appropriate methods to stop it." This is what I hope everyone in this conference will pay attention to. (2) This movement organ should not exist in countries where politics has long been stable, because there is no need for it to exist. Therefore, although we have initiated this conference, we really hope that this movement will be successful as soon as possible and that this organ will disappear as soon as possible. Therefore, the charter stipulates that "The term of this conference shall be temporarily set at five years, but if no civil war occurs before the expiration date, and it is considered unnecessary to carry out the movement to abolish it again, it may be dissolved in advance." It can be seen that the members of this conference do not want to make use of this organ. But if civil war cannot be eliminated, we are prepared to fight to the end. This is what I hope everyone in this conference will pay attention to. (3) The abolish war movement is a peace movement. Since we take peace as our purpose, our movement method is of course to adopt peaceful methods. Therefore, the charter stipulates that when it is absolutely necessary, we will adopt the principle of non-cooperation, and everyone should strictly restrain themselves. But we believe that this principle can be thoroughly implemented or even more effective than any other principle. This is what I hope everyone in this conference will pay attention to. Finally, I can clearly state to you that I believe that if we follow the spirit of the charter of this conference, set up more branches, recruit more members, and everyone strives for this simple goal, civil war can absolutely be eliminated, and therefore foreign insults can absolutely be resisted. I hereby wish the success of this conference in advance."</p>
<p>▲ Preparatory Report: Chairman Lin Kanghou reported on the preparatory process on behalf of the preparatory committee, saying: (1) The motivation for preparation: More than 20 years have passed since the establishment of the Republic of China, and the method used to solve national affairs has always been to resort to force. So far, where are all the rights of freedom and equality? Which is better and which is worse is self-evident. We often think about which is better between force and peace. Now, after 20 years of trial, we have proved the wrong of force. However, some people doubt that we have no weapons in our hands, and what ability do we have to abolish civil war? It is unknown that organization can generate power. Foreigners often say that Chinese people are a plate of loose sand, with no organizational ability. The initiation of the Abolish Civil War Grand Alliance is the best test of whether Chinese people have organizational ability. Since its publication, it has had a great impact in various places, which shows that abolishing civil war is what everyone wants. Whoever has this reason in common. (2) Preparatory process: A) From the initiation to the present, it has been four months, and the preparatory committee was established on June 30th. Up to August 26th, a total of 16 preparatory meetings were held. (B) As of yesterday, a total of 401 groups and 1,057 individuals have joined the initiators, including 8 commercial association federations, 72 commercial associations in various cities and counties, 10 banking associations, 9 financial associations, 104 industry associations, 42 industry associations, 18 overseas Chinese groups, 11 women's groups, 11 hometown groups, 59 academic groups, and 58 other groups. (C) Calculated by province, there are Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Suiyuan, Jilin, and other provinces, as well as Zhangjiakou, Weihaiwei, Qingdao, Beiping, Tianjin, Taiyuan, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Shanghai, a total of 29 provinces and cities, and overseas Chinese in Vietnam, Singapore, Batavia, Maipo, Hong Kong, Macau, Myanmar, etc. It can be said that a plate of loose sand has been glued together. (D) As of 7:30 pm on the 26th, 355 group representatives and 77 individual members had registered, totaling 432 people. This morning, 16 group representatives and 1 individual member from afar continued to arrive, totaling 449 people. (3) A glimpse of the preparation period: When Chen Jitang and Chen Ce of Guangdong clashed, the preparatory committee sent Mr. Zhu Ziqiao, Chen Liting, and Zha Liangzhao to Guangdong to persuade them. At the beginning, the Guangdong side was quite suspicious of what background our association had. After a detailed explanation, they frankly believed it. Although we dare not say that the early resolution of this clash between the two Chens was due to the efforts of the three representatives of our association, the three representatives were actually able to resolve it so quickly. After the official establishment of this association, the responsibility for eliminating civil war is even heavier, and the method of its work can be summed up in one word: "begging bitterly." This is what Chairman Wu said about adopting peaceful means.</p>
<p>▲ Representatives' Speeches: (1) Huang Wenzhong said that there are many representatives present today, but there are very few who actually come from the fields. There may even be no farmers who actually farm the land, which is a bit disappointing. In Gansu Province, the number of people who have died directly or indirectly from civil war in recent years has reached more than 3 million, which is about the same as the population of Shanghai. However, due to inconvenient transportation, no one pays attention. Recently, although some people have advocated developing the Northwest because of the fall of the Northeast, if civil war breaks out again, there will be no way to do it. In the future, we must arouse the people, make a great determination, and fight to the end with the soldiers who initiate civil war. Otherwise, relying only on passive non-cooperation, under the threat of guns, we will have to cooperate with pain. There are many meetings and speeches in the treaty ports, but it is feared that organizing abolish war branches in the inland provinces will lead to unwarranted disasters. (2) Lin Kecong, representative of the Women's Relief Association, said briefly that the civil wars in recent years have all been wars for warlords to seize power and profit, resulting in repeated foreign insults and the country's demise day by day. To truly abolish civil war, we must resist foreign insults and fight against foreign countries, so that we can unify domestic intentions. He also cited the example of the rise of European and Asian countries after World War I. (3) Hu Jianru, representative of the Nanchang City Education Association, said briefly that Jiangxi has suffered from the scourge of the Communist Party since the 18th year of the Republic of China. After each time it was about to be completely cleared, troops were transferred due to civil war, and all previous efforts were abandoned. In the past four years, the more they were suppressed, the more they became. (4) Liu Wang Liming of the Women's Temperance Society said briefly that many representatives of the Women's Temperance Society from various places have come to participate in the conference, so they have left their families to attend here, so they have expressed the hope of abolishing civil war and the awakening of women. China has fought a total of 32 wars from the Second Revolution to the clash between the two Chens in Guangdong. At that time, there was no public criticism. Today, representatives from all provinces and cities in the country have come here to discuss the abolition of civil war, which can be said to be a turning point for the revival of the Chinese nation. (5) Liu Jichen said briefly that if we can eliminate opinions and unite against foreign aggression, then civil war can be abolished. (6) Zhang Zhijun said briefly that the origin of civil war is poor politics. The government cannot command soldiers, but is instead used by soldiers. The people responsible for civil war are soldiers, politicians, and the financial community who do not understand the big picture. Therefore, the method of abolishing civil war is passive non-cooperation with those who engage in civil war, which requires a great awakening of the financial community. On the active side, we must organize a government that represents all the people and implement democratic politics. (7) Fu Yueqi of the Hunan Business Federation said briefly that this association is a national salvation and ethnic salvation conference. It must be implemented among the people, and the people must be awakened with great perseverance to resist powerful forces and fight against Japan. (8) Zhang Juemin of the Hai Chen warship said briefly that he is a soldier and deeply ashamed. He hopes that the people can sacrifice and fight to resist foreign insults, so that civil war can be initiated and stopped. (9) Li Gongpu reported on the situation of the International Association, the foreigners' misunderstanding of the causes of civil war in China, and the doubts and suspicions of the people in various provinces in the interior about the power of this association. (10) Liu Jun said that the workers suffered the most during the January 28th Incident. At that time, those with assets and status all took refuge in the concessions, while the hard-working workers had to suffer the destruction of airplanes and bombs. Their pain could not be imagined by those who lived comfortably in foreign houses and relied on newspapers for information. After the ceasefire, they were followed by unemployment and wage reductions, suffering all kinds of hardships. In all wars, whether it is imperialist aggression against China or domestic warlord wars, those who are killed are the poor and hard-working workers and peasants. This is why we oppose warlord wars, and especially oppose the wars in which warlords kill tens of millions of hard-working workers and peasants. (11) Chen Peide of the Joint Association of National Salvation Groups said briefly that to abolish civil war, the people must be armed, the conscription system must be abolished, and the conscription system must be implemented. (12) Zhou Youdong said briefly that we must promote work, form more branches, have perseverance, implement resolutions, and create a central idea of abolishing civil war. (13) Huang Linseng said briefly that economic non-cooperation can abolish civil war. He cited the example of the strike in Hong Kong and the province after the May 30th Incident and the Shakui Massacre.</p>

<h3 id="e17">Eurasia Aviation Will Open Next Month, Test Flight Plane in Lanzhou <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>▲Shanghai to Xinjiang Ticket Price Needs More Than 1,500 Yuan</p>
<p>▲Beijing-Shanghai Line Can Resume Original Flight on the 6th of Next Month</p>
<p>▲Guangzhou-Hankou Line is Being Actively Planned</p>
<p>Eurasia Aviation, since Li Jingcong, the former director of the Eurasia Aviation Company's management team, made a test flight last year with good results.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>The company actively prepared for it. After several board meetings, it was decided that August and September would be the full-line test flight time. The company immediately followed the resolution and sent Liao Guanxuan, the director of the Operations Team, and Shi Mide, the director of the Aviation Team, by plane from Beiping on the 10th of this month to conduct a full-line test flight. According to Mr. Sun Mutang, the company's secretary, the test flight process, the exact date of the official opening, and the planning situation of the Guangzhou-Hankou line are quite detailed, and are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲Test Flight Plane Stays in Lanzhou According to Mr. Sun, the Eurasia airline, since Liao Guanxuan, the director of the Operations Team of this company, and Shi Mide, the director of the Aviation Team, took the Eurasia No. 6 plane and took off from Beiping, arrived in Lanzhou earlier. Due to the arrangement of stations along the way and the problem of gasoline, there were many delays on the way. In addition, due to the climate of Suzhou, it is still staying in Lanzhou. The report said that it had been test-flying from Lanzhou to Dihua, and it was said that the industry had flown back from Dihua, and the test flight was successful. All were not facts. This company still received a telegram from Shi Mide yesterday, and it is indeed in Lanzhou. It will continue to fly within days. The arrangement between the stations that passed by is almost ready, and there is no problem with gasoline. However, in the future official flight, the gasoline from Hami to Dihua will still need to be purchased from Russia. Although there is gasoline in Xinjiang, it has not been refined and cannot be used. After the success of transportation in the future, after the development is implemented there, the gasoline problem seems not to have to be purchased from Russia again. As for the section from Hami to Dihua, this section is the most difficult place to fly on the entire line. The middle of the road is all desert, and it takes seven days for daily transportation, which is carried by camels. If the test flight is successful in the future, transportation will be much easier.</p>
<p>▲Ticket Price and Time The test flight plane has decided to complete the full line back to Shanghai within a week. It is expected to officially open to traffic around the 15th of next month. As for the time and ticket price, it is currently being drafted. The approximate full-line ticket price is about 1,500 yuan. It is estimated that it will be 50 yuan from Shanghai to Nanjing, 100 yuan from Nanjing to Luoyang, 75 yuan from Luoyang to Xi'an, 230 yuan from Xi'an to Lanzhou, 300 yuan from Lanzhou to Suzhou, 270 yuan from Suzhou to Hami, 250 yuan from Hami to Dihua, and 275 yuan from Dihua to Tacheng.</p>
<p>▲Beijing-Shanghai Route Also, the line from Shanghai to Nanjing was temporarily suspended due to the impact of the January 28th Shanghai Incident. Since the ceasefire, passengers on the Beijing-Shanghai line have felt inconvenient. Therefore, this company is still actively preparing to resume it. It is expected that it will be able to resume flights around the 6th of next month.</p>
<p>▲Guangzhou-Hankou Route As for the Guangzhou-Hankou route, it starts from Guangzhou, passes through Changsha, and goes to Hankou. This company had wanted to plan to open it earlier, so that it could be connected to the Xi'an section of the Eurasia Line. It can also be said to be a branch line of the Eurasia Aviation. It is still being actively planned and will definitely be realized in the future. After the Eurasia route is completed, there will be the Pingluo line in the north and the Guangzhou-Hankou line in the south, which can collect postal items from the north and south and transport them to the Eurasia main line, directly connecting to Europe.</p>
<h3 id="e18">Shanghai Banks Prepaid Paper Money Tax Yesterday <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>▲Collected by the Central Bank on behalf of the government, the tax rate is reduced</p>
<p>▲Foreign banks are negotiating for collection</p>
<p>▲The Ministry of Finance agrees to reduce the tax rate by 1.2%</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, as a result of repeated consultations between the representatives of the Bankers Association and Finance Minister Song, the Ministry of Finance has agreed to reduce the tax rate. However, the exact amount of the reduction must be formally announced after being reviewed by the Ministry of Finance. However, because the Ministry of Finance is in urgent need of funds, it first asked the issuing banks to prepay the tax. It is heard that by yesterday, all domestic issuing banks in this city had paid the tax, which was sent to the Central Bank for collection on their behalf. The foreign banks that issue banknotes include HSBC, Standard Chartered, Citibank, Oriental, and Banque Sino-Belge, etc. The total amount of issuance is also considerable. It is heard that the government is negotiating for collection.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the issue of the Ministry of Finance's collection of the paper money issuance tax has been discussed repeatedly. The other day, the banking representatives Li Fusun and Hu Bijiang visited Minister Song again to continue discussions. According to the Central News Agency reporter, the reasons for the Ministry of Finance's collection of the paper money issuance tax this time are two: (1) The issuers of banknotes in all countries are national banks. Although various different banknotes can be circulated in one country, the right to issue them all belongs to the government, just like our country's stamps. Although there are various different stamps such as Sun Yat-sen, Liao Zhongkai, and Huang Xing, the right to issue them all belongs to the government. Our country's banknotes are not like that. Commercial banks can also issue them with special permission. According to statistics, the total amount of banknotes currently circulating in the country is about 300 million yuan, and those issued by commercial banks account for the majority of them. In order to prevent banknotes from flooding the market, the government has decided to implement the collection of the paper money issuance tax based on the principle that the right to issue banknotes belongs to the government. (2) In order to maintain the government's credit, Minister Song has tried to pay the principal and interest of the government bonds of 8 million yuan per month on schedule, no matter how difficult the finances are. The monthly expenditure on military and political expenses is also very large. Therefore, it is necessary to seek new sources of income. The collection of the paper money issuance tax was promulgated by the Central Government a long time ago. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance has decided to implement the collection in accordance with the order and will never stop it due to any difficulties. This time, the banking sector requested the Ministry of Finance to reduce the tax rate due to the economic downturn. The Ministry of Finance has agreed to reduce it slightly. However, the banking sector requested that it be reduced to 1%, because it is too different from the original tax rate, and it is difficult to make it a reality. The minimum limit of the Ministry of Finance is to reduce it to 1.5%. As for the matter of borrowing money from the banking sector, the Ministry of Finance strongly denied it. Minister Song has decided to fly to Beijing today, but this issue will not be stopped because Song has left Shanghai. Since the Ministry of Finance has agreed to reduce the tax rate, the intermediary will come out to mediate in order to find a solution.</p>
<h3 id="e19">Song and Cai Fly to Beijing Today <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Song Ziwen, the Vice President of the Executive Yuan and concurrently the Minister of Finance, has been in Shanghai to negotiate financial issues for many days. The Central Government has repeatedly urged him to return to Beijing to act as the President of the Executive Yuan. Chiang Kai-shek also telegraphed Song the night before last to urge him. It is now learned that Song has decided to fly to Beijing with Cai Tingkai, the Commander-in-Chief of the 19th Route Army, today. Cai is going to report to the Central Government on the recent situation of suppressing bandits in Fujian Province. According to Xin Sheng News Agency, Song Ziwen, the acting President of the Executive Yuan, had planned to go to Beijing the day before yesterday, but he could not make it because the matters he was handling in Shanghai were not completed. It is now learned that Song has decided to go to Beijing today or tomorrow. Before leaving Shanghai, Song had many pending cases regarding the blockade of the customs. Yesterday morning at about 10:00, he summoned Zhang Fuyun, the Director of the Customs Administration, to his residence for a meeting. The conversation lasted for one and a half hours before Director Zhang left. Mayor Wu Tiecheng also visited Song yesterday.</p>

<p>▲Negotiations on the Activities of Japanese Rogues</p>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' Federation, the Hongkou District Branches, and the Joint Office of the Commercial Federation of Hanbil Road, Jiaxing Road, Tongzhou Road, Yangshupu Road, Broadway Road, Wuchang Road, Haining Road, East and West Huade Road, Yinxiang Road, Suzhou Road, Algin Road, Chuanbao Road, North Xizang Road, North Jiangxi Road, and other organizations, according to the resolutions of yesterday's emergency meeting, elected representatives to submit a petition to the Municipal Government, requesting negotiations to ban the activities of Japanese rogues in the Hongkou area, and demanding compensation for the damage caused by the Japanese Marines to the Chen Wanxing Factory on Washington Road and Yangzhou Road, and for the stabbing of Chinese people. The representatives are scheduled to petition the Municipal Government before the 29th. The text of the petition is attached below:</p>
<p>The petition is to request your government to make serious protests in order to maintain peace and tranquility among the people, due to the armed arrogance of the Japanese police team and the red-shirt group in the Hongkou area, which has created a dangerous situation. Since the January 28th Shanghai Incident, the citizens of Hongkou have suffered greatly. Each returned to their respective places, hoping to survive the disaster and restore the market. However, the Japanese ambition and cunning are that the troop withdrawal was not long before the Marines armed and ferocious, and came to violence again. At 11:00 pm on the 10th of this month, they went to Washington Road, Yangzhou Road and other places, and were demolishing the bamboo fences of the Chen Wanxing factory, and stabbing many Chinese people (the details have been presented before), causing the citizens of this district to be panicked all day long. Moreover, this district is under the jurisdiction of the Public Concession police power. Any accident that occurs is responsible for maintaining local security. Now, Japanese rogues have organized the Japanese Police Team and the Red-Shirt Group, citing the Asian Company bombing case, and divided them into reconnaissance patrol and protection teams, each team of 20 people, rampant in various districts, causing great panic among the citizens. The usually peaceful market has suddenly become a terrifying and dangerous environment. Shanghai has suffered a violent change, and the commercial depression has been unbearable to recover. How can the Japanese act recklessly for no reason, causing the local area to present a disturbing atmosphere, and businessmen and people cannot live and work in peace, and feel even more painful. The associations held a joint meeting of representatives from various districts on the 26th of this month, and resolved to send representatives to petition the Municipal Government, quickly put forward serious negotiations, stop the Japanese rogues from acting recklessly, in order to maintain commerce and stabilize the locality, etc. The reason is to submit a document by Zhang Xianfang, Wang Rongtang, and other six representatives to submit to your government, petition for everything, to hope to see, and to negotiate according to reason, and must achieve the goal, in order to save the citizens of Hongkou into a stable environment, then the recovery of industry and commerce, depends on this move, respectfully present.</p>

<p>According to Datong News Agency, the new Marine Corps soldiers who came to Shanghai from Japan yesterday morning at 9:00 continued to visit the Zhabei war zone. The Public Security Bureau of the Five Districts, in order to comply with the order of the Municipal Government, sent police to guide them to avoid misunderstandings among the citizens. Therefore, police chief Wang Molin led four policemen on bicycles to wait at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Hongjiang Road in advance. When the Marine Corps arrived, they joined forces to guide them to visit the war zones. The route they took was the same as yesterday. Only when they finally arrived at Yokohama Road, all the Marine Corps soldiers got off the bus and entered the Japanese Cemetery to silently pray in front of the tombs of the fallen Japanese soldiers in the Shanghai War buried there. After five minutes, they came out and divided into two columns, one from Tiantong'an Station and the other from East Yokohama Road Dourui An Road to return.

<p>▲Correcting the Japanese Newspaper's Records</p>
<p>According to Datong News Agency, yesterday, the Japanese newspaper Shanghai Daily News published an article titled "Mayor Wu's General Answer Against," saying that the activities of the Japanese plainclothes team were to protest to the Japanese Consul, etc. Datong News Agency reporters specially visited Counselor Yin yesterday morning to inquire about the truth. According to Counselor Yin, the author met with Murai yesterday and had an informal conversation. As for the main points of the conversation, it was nothing more than saying that the overstepping and illegal actions have always been on the list of crackdowns, so there are absolutely no such incidents in the Chinese community. As for the security order in the concession area, the concession authorities are responsible for it. I hope to tell the Japanese nationals not to disturb each other and only cause panic. As for the various sections published in the newspaper, they are purely speculative and not factual. The author feels very sorry for this kind of record that intends to provoke and shake the people's hearts. I have already sent a letter to the newspaper to correct it and asked the Japanese authorities to ban it.</p>
<h3 id="e24">Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Submits a Petition to Organize a Committee to Encourage the Use of National Products <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Assembly, in view of the fact that foreign goods have been flooding the market in recent years and national products have fallen behind, believes that it is necessary to intensify efforts to promote national products.</p>
<p>Publicity is not enough to reverse the decline and awaken the people. In addition to supervising the various departments of the association</p>
<p>The staff within the company are all required to use national products. Special provisions</p>
<p>A document was submitted to the Municipal Party Department and the Municipal Government, jointly organizing a committee to encourage the use of national products, so as to achieve practical results. The text of the document is recorded later. The document is submitted to request various agencies to jointly organize a committee to encourage the use of national products.</p>
<p>, In order to promote and recover the rights, it is said that Shanghai is a bustling area for merchants, which is related to the observation of China and foreign countries. The development of national products and the revitalization of industries are all important. If there is only empty talk to promote, and there is no practical method, it will not only lose its effectiveness, but also affect the whole country. The association is aware of this, and even more because foreign goods have been flooding the market in recent years, Shanghai is in danger. There is an urgent need to promote national products. Therefore, it organized a committee to promote national products and plan to set up a national products commercial field, actively carry out, spare no effort, to the manufacture of each factory's goods, the search and storage of raw materials, the selection of quality, the research of decoration, the evaluation of prices, and the convenience of use, so that the production side, strive to improve, followed by a firm and unyielding ambition, fight to the end, and hope for success, the association is in business, has done its duty to promote, and also hopes that the government, set an example, urge the service personnel of various agencies, all purchase and use national products, and use the method of punishment and reward to create a natural effect, and make a call from a high place, and the mountains respond, gather ideas and benefit, and get twice the result with half the effort. In addition, the former central government stipulated that there are seven local self-government movements, and the promotion of national products is one of them. It is the government that has long been leading the people to work together to promote national products. However, the words are heard clearly, but the actual effect is not seen. The reason for this is not that the government's promotion is not strong, but that there is no concrete method. For the sake of today, it is allowed to ask your government (the department will meet later, and the mayor will be the chairman) and the heads of various bureaus to be the initiators, and serve as the competent committee members, and order the subordinates to follow suit, such as the upper behavior, the lower effect, it is not difficult to promote from Shanghai to the whole country, Shanghai</p>
<p>Since the January 28th Incident, national product factories have been destroyed. At this time of commercial depression and market recession, the future of national products is extremely dangerous. Our people should uphold the heart of self-love and patriotism, and strive to formulate methods of resistance, and implement self-production, self-manufacture and self-use.</p>
<p>If so, national products can be developed, and the source will not flow out, and the economic invasion methods of those generations will have no way to achieve. The humble opinion is about to be Chen, and I respectfully ask you to implement it, which is a public convenience. Sincerely present to the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Shanghai Municipal Party Department,"</p>

<h3 id="e30">American Sailor Drunk and Beats a Chinese Man to Death <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>▲ Four Sailors Dancing and Drinking</p>
<p>▲ Forcibly Taking Fruit from a Vendor</p>
<p>▲ Eating It All Without Paying a Cent</p>
<p>▲ Vendor Beaten and Dies from Injuries</p>
<p>At the dance hall of the Jue Lu Hotel on Xizang Road, at 10:30 PM on the 25th, four American naval soldiers stationed in Shanghai, not wearing uniforms, arrived. They danced and drank to their heart's content before leaving. When they left the venue, they were all drunk and staggering. Passing by a fruit vendor, Wu Da Kui from Changzhou, on the side of the road across from the Jue Lu Hotel, they each grabbed the fruits from Wu's basket and devoured them. In a short while, they emptied the basket without paying a single penny and left. Wu hurriedly demanded payment from them, but the four sailors became enraged due to their drunkenness. They suddenly punched Wu with their fists. One of the sailors even used the stool Wu was sitting on to beat Wu's head and other parts of his body. Wu was outnumbered and, as it was late at night, could not call for help. Although a few passersby saw the injustice, none dared to offer assistance. As a result, Wu was severely beaten and fell to the ground in pain. The sailors were about to flee when, fortunately, nearby patrol officers heard the alarm and arrived, taking both parties to the Old Zhabei Police Station. After questioning by the police chief, Wu was ordered to be sent to Renji Hospital for treatment, and the four sailors were handed over to their officers for investigation. However, Wu's injuries were very serious, and he was already forty-two years old. He died the next morning. The hospital then informed the police station to send the body to the Philen Road autopsy center in Hongkou. They also began investigating the family members of the deceased. After a day of effort, they only found Zhu Su Lin, a relative of the deceased. The family members were all in their hometown. At 10:00 AM yesterday, the police station sent Zhu and witnesses Wu Fu'an and Zhou Bosheng, who had seen the assault, to the autopsy center. Subsequently, Guo Wei, a prosecutor from the First Special District Local Court, along with a clerk and a forensic doctor, arrived at the center to conduct an autopsy. After the examination, they took their seats in public. The Western police chief reported the occurrence and investigation of the case and presented the autopsy report. However, none of the four sailors were present. According to the testimony of Wu and Zhou, they were passing by at the time and witnessed the brutal assault. The four sailors were not wearing uniforms but were dressed in ordinary Western suits and pants, all in the same yellow color. The assailant who used the stool had a red tie. As for the person's build, it was of medium height and well-proportioned, neither too fat nor too thin, with no special features. If they saw him again, they would still be able to identify him, they said. After Guo, the prosecutor, completed the autopsy and interrogation, he ordered Zhu Su Lin to sign a bond and claim the body for coffin burial.</p>

<h3 id="e32">Reactions to the National Movement Committee's Telegram <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Since the Central Party Headquarters' Mass Movement Guidance Committee issued a telegram regarding the issue of enterprises, it has attracted the attention of various industrial groups and domestic goods factories across the country. They have jointly issued a declaration and submitted it to the Central Party Headquarters and various ministries and departments, requesting a correction. The original text is reproduced below:</p>
<p>▲ Declaration: Yesterday, we read in the newspapers that, regarding the labor-capital dispute at the Shanghai Sanyou Industrial Society, the Central Party Headquarters' Mass Movement Guidance Committee, in its telegram to the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters and the Municipal Government, stated that "extraordinary means should be used to force the capitalists to resume work by a specific date." Article 37 of the Provisional Constitution states that the people have the freedom to engage in business. In law, this is an absolute private right. Forcing work to resume is not only a violation of the spirit of the Provisional Constitution but also sets a bad precedent unprecedented in the world. China's industry is just beginning to sprout. In the past four or five years, the government has repeatedly issued orders and declarations to protect it. Now, the facts are quite the opposite, and we are even more apprehensive. We dare to express our sincere opinions and seek the protection of public opinion to achieve a legal and proper solution. We hereby make this solemn declaration and respectfully hope that all sectors will take note.

<p>▲ Telegram to the Central Party Headquarters in Nanjing, the National Government, and various ministries and departments: We have read in the newspapers that the Central Party Headquarters' Mass Movement Guidance Committee, in its telegram to the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters and the Municipal Government regarding the labor-capital dispute at the Sanyou Industrial Society, stated that "extraordinary means should be used to force the capitalists to resume work by a specific date." According to Article 37 of the Provisional Constitution, the people have the freedom to engage in business. In law, this is an absolute private right and is not subject to public law. Now, the words in the telegram order that extraordinary means be used to force work to resume. It should be considered whether these steps are consistent with the Provisional Constitution. The Provisional Constitution only explicitly states that businesses that violate the law should be ordered to close. We have not heard of any regulations that force work to resume. If such a precedent is set, not only will the people's freedom to engage in business be unable to be guaranteed, but the country's credit will also lose its dignity. China's industry is just beginning to sprout. It is subjected to the economic pressure of the great powers externally and the pain of natural disasters and man-made calamities internally. Maintaining the status quo is already extremely difficult. How much more so when the government has found this unfortunate fact in the midst of its repeated declarations to protect industry? From the standpoint of those in the industry, at most, we can only sacrifice everything we have, abandon the efforts of decades, and throw it all away. Who will bear the heavy responsibility for the country's future production and the people's livelihood? Therefore, we must still ask the party and state authorities to weigh the pros and cons and investigate whether the telegram violates the spirit of the Provisional Constitution. At the same time, we also ask that it be corrected. We would be most fortunate for the future of industry. We send this telegram with great anxiety, awaiting your orders.

<h3 id="e33">Fire Breaks Out Again at the Sanyou Factory Yesterday <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>▲ The Cause is Unknown, the Union Petitions for a Thorough Investigation</p>
<p>▲ The Capitalists Have Agreed to Issue the Ninth Installment of Food Allowances</p>
<p>According to Da Gong She, at 11:00 AM yesterday, a fire suddenly broke out in the white coal room of the Sanyou Industrial Society's main factory in Yinxiang Port. Thanks to timely rescue efforts, it did not become a major disaster. The cause of the fire is unknown. The union has submitted a petition to the party and government agencies, requesting a thorough investigation. In addition, at 4:00 PM, the factory's tap water suddenly stopped. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Another Fire Alarm: At 11:20 AM yesterday, a fire suddenly broke out in the factory's white coal room. For a time, thick smoke billowed and flames raged. Since no workers lived in the factory and the room was located on the barren ground at the back (adjacent to the woodworking room on the west and the ironworking room on the north), workers Zhang Dingliang and Wu Guocai discovered it. They rushed to the factory to investigate, but they were stopped by the security guard stationed at the factory gate. After negotiation, they were allowed to enter and quickly released the fire hose to put out the fire. They also notified the Yangshupu Fire Brigade and the Zhabei Second and Third Section Fire Brigades by telephone to rush to the scene. The fire was extinguished after twenty minutes. As a result, a section of the fence was burned, half a room was destroyed, and the loss of white coal, wood, and other items was relatively small. Afterwards, a reporter visited the factory to investigate and inquire about the cause of the fire. He met Shen Guocai, a worker stationed at the factory for security. According to him, the cause of the fire was quite peculiar, and it was difficult to know the truth. The coal room was located on the barren ground at the back, adjacent to the woodworking room on the west and the ironworking room on the north, and no one lived there, and no one ever came and went. It was very puzzling that a fire broke out. Fortunately, it was daytime and did not become a major disaster. If it had been at night, the consequences would have been unimaginable, he said.</p>
<p>▲ Petition for a Thorough Investigation: The Cotton Textile Industry Union of the Seventh District believes that the two fires at the factory are unusual. Yesterday, it specially submitted a petition to the party and government agencies, requesting a thorough investigation to clarify the truth. The original petition is as follows: "We are submitting a petition because a fire suddenly broke out at the Sanyou Society's main factory at around 11:00 AM today, at the location where the police detachment is stationed, requesting a prompt and thorough investigation to ensure public safety. Since the police detachment has been stationed at the factory since the 11th of this month, after the house near the factory on Mayushan Road was burned down on the morning of the 18th, an electrical fire occurred again two days later. The union has submitted written reports to the government and the bureau. Unexpectedly, at around 11:00 AM today, thick smoke suddenly billowed from the front section of the factory (i.e., the location where the police detachment is stationed). After the workers noticed it, they immediately requested to enter and inspect whether it was a fire in the factory. However, the members of the police detachment stopped them, refusing to allow them to enter. After repeated negotiations, workers Zhang Tingliang and Wu Guicheng were allowed to enter. When they traced the source of the smoke, they saw that the fire had started from the fence in the southeast corner of the small machine room and spread to the corner of the small machine room. At this time, the wind was very strong, and the danger was even greater. Therefore, the workers in the factory forced their way in and rushed to put out the fire. By the time the fire trucks from the concession arrived, the fire had almost been extinguished. It was found that the police detachment had completely removed the copper badges on their collars, making it impossible to identify them. This is suspicious point number one. When thick smoke billowed from the factory, they did not immediately investigate. This is suspicious point number two. When the workers noticed it, they requested to inspect it, but they still wanted to stop them. This is suspicious point number three. The area was not allowed for workers to enter and leave, and a fire suddenly broke out. This is suspicious point number four. Afterwards, when the crowd questioned them, they claimed not to know the reason. This is suspicious point number five. The police detachment bears the heavy responsibility of protecting the factory, but two fires have occurred in less than half a month. Not only did they not immediately investigate, but they also prevented the workers from putting out the fire. What is their intention? It is impossible to predict. Moreover, the front section of the factory is close to the Wangjiazhai Samsung Factory and the Shenjiazhai area on Mayushan Road. Fortunately, this incident occurred during the day, and it was discovered early. Fortunately, it was put out and did not cause a major disaster. If it had been late at night and there had not been enough time to rescue it, the harm would have been unimaginable. The union witnessed this with a heavy heart and could not sit idly by. Therefore, we have prepared a special document and submitted it to the government and the bureau, requesting a prompt and thorough investigation to protect public safety. We submit this urgently, awaiting your orders." Respectfully presented to the Municipal Government, Municipal Party Headquarters, Public Security Bureau, and Social Affairs Bureau.</p>
<p>▲ Chamber of Commerce's Reply: The Municipal Chamber of Commerce replied to the General Labor Union yesterday, saying: "We have received your letter of the 25th of this month, stating that the closure of the Yinxiang Factory of the Sanyou Society has caused a dispute. You have asked us to write to the factory manager to persuade him to reopen the factory as soon as possible and to discuss solutions. We have now received a notice from the Municipal Government that this matter has been submitted to arbitration. Therefore, how to resolve this matter fairly and justly is entirely within the scope of the arbitrators. We are sending this letter in reply, please take note." Respectfully to the Shanghai General Labor Union.</p>
<p>▲ Agreed to Provide Food Allowances: At around 10:00 AM yesterday, Zhu Guilin, a representative of the Social Affairs Bureau, Zhou Lianze, a representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, and Xia Zhongzhao and Gong Zitian, representatives of the labor union, went to the Sanyou Company to collect the food allowance for the ninth period. Wang Xianhua, the executive director of the company, received them and agreed to pay the full amount.</p>
<p>▲ Rescue Meeting: The Committee to Rescue the Starving Workers of the Sanyou Factory held a meeting yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM. The attending committee members were Zhou Xuexiang, Zhu Xuefan, Ye Xianggao, Shao Xubai, Chen Peide, and Zhao Zhenhui. Zhou Xuexiang chaired the meeting. Shao Xubai first reported on the process of persuading the workers to resume eating and resolved: (1) Confidential. (2) When the Municipal Government convenes the Arbitration Committee, representatives should be appointed to attend. It was resolved that Shao Xubai and Zhou Xuexiang should be appointed to attend. (3) A request should be submitted to the General Labor Union to order the labor unions to quickly raise donations for assistance. It was resolved that it should be passed.</p>
<p>▲ Water Supply Cut Off: At 4:00 PM yesterday, the water supply from all the faucets in the factory suddenly stopped. At that time, it was time for the workers to cook, so they panicked and rushed to report to the labor union. After receiving the report, the labor union immediately notified the British Shanghai Waterworks Company by telephone and inquired about the reason. According to the company, they did not send anyone to seal off the water supply. It was suddenly cut off, which was difficult to explain. They also said that since the person in charge of the company was not present, they could not send a craftsman to investigate, but they promised to try their best to restore it. However, as of the time the reporter submitted the manuscript, the water had not yet been restored.</p>
<h3 id="e34">Mr. Wang Luyi's Talk on the Dispute at the Dockworkers' Union <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Recently, due to the dispute over the 28% system, the contractors saw that the central government's attitude was firm and ordered the municipal government to detain a small number of obstructive foremen. They then thought of using the excuse of improving the dockworkers' union first to divert attention. Yesterday, there was news that the municipal party headquarters was reorganizing the dockworkers' union. When the labor side heard the news, they were filled with righteous indignation and there was a tendency to strike, and the situation was deteriorating. Reporters visited the vice chairman of the Central People's Movement Committee and asked about the truth of the matter. His interview record is as follows: (Question) The dockworkers' 28% system problem has been delayed for four years, how will the central government resolve it? (Wang) The central government has made a very strong determination on this issue. However, to resolve the dispute, it is necessary to review the contractor's contract and find out how much the contractor's wage is. However, the contractor has repeatedly disobeyed orders. The central government has ordered the municipal government to enforce it and has telegraphed the municipal government to detain the obstructive foremen. This case can only be discussed after the contract is reviewed. (Question) It is recently heard that Mayor Wu will convene the directors of the Social Affairs Bureau and Public Security Bureau, as well as representatives of the Municipal Party Headquarters, Central Party Headquarters, and Ministry of Industry, this week to discuss the matter together. What is the main point of the discussion? (Wang) It is probably to discuss how to implement the central government's compulsory enforcement order and to discuss the implementation steps and methods for the 28% system in detail. (Question) It is heard that the Municipal Party Headquarters has reorganized the dockworkers' union yesterday, is it true? (Wang) I met Comrade Wu Kaixian a few days ago, and Wu mentioned it, but only said that he intends to improve the union committee. It is heard that the list of eleven people proposed by the Municipal Party Headquarters yesterday completely replaced the previous members of the union. Some of the members are even bank presidents and the largest contractors. The most surprising thing is that there are almost no workers among the members. This not only violates the six principles established by the central government, but also violates the central government's order that all unions must not be reorganized or established before the Trade Union Law is revised. I believe that reorganizing the dockworkers' union at this time will only make the situation more chaotic. Moreover, this matter is related to the livelihood of 80,000 dockworkers in Shanghai and the party's stance of supporting labor. I now want to send a letter to Comrade Wu to cancel this proposal. After finishing speaking, Committee Member Wang picked up a pen and wrote a letter to Wu, the general idea being that the dockworkers' union matter is of great importance, and the responsible comrades should deal with it carefully. It is heard that the members of the union include bank presidents and the largest contractors. This will only lead to more disputes, not only sacrificing the interests of labor, but also not helping the capitalists. It will only be the contractors who exploit from the middle who will receive the most blame. After finishing the letter, the reporter said goodbye and left.</p>

<h3 id="e37">City Chamber of Commerce Notice to All Sectors: Beware of Counterfeits <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>▲ Jiangyin Does Not Have a Dafeng Textile Mill</p>
<p>▲ The "Jiufeng" Trademark Is Fictitious</p>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce, seeing that at a time when the promotion of national goods is enthusiastically advocated, there are always unscrupulous merchants who profit by counterfeiting, hindering the development of industry, has been diligently investigating. Recently, it was discovered that products bearing the "Jiufeng" trademark of the Dafeng Textile Mill in Jiangyin are being sold. Upon investigation, there is no such factory in Jiangyin at all. It can be known that it is counterfeit. Yesterday, a special notice was issued to all sectors to avoid being deceived. The original text is recorded below for the public scrutiny of national mass organizations:</p>
<p>The Chamber previously received reports that some people were altering Sichuan lingpai Zhigong ni and foreign yarn, etc., and changing them to the "Jiufeng" trademark of the Dafeng Textile Mill in Jiangyin to counterfeit national goods. It telegraphed the Jiangyin County Chamber of Commerce to investigate whether there was indeed a Dafeng Textile Mill there in order to handle the matter. It has now been reported back, relayed from the Fabric Industry Guild, that none of the guild's members, nor any other factories in the county, have this Dafeng brand. It is hoped that this will be carefully examined and investigated to protect national goods and warn unscrupulous merchants.</p>
<p>All national mass organizations and sectors are requested to pay attention. All Zhigong ni yarn and fabric using the "Jiufeng" trademark of the Dafeng Textile Mill in Jiangyin that are being sold in the territory are counterfeit goods and should be detained and investigated to prevent confusion.</p>
<p>Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce Respectfully.</p>
<h3 id="e38">City Chamber of Commerce Cables Government Requesting Negotiations on Fiji's Increased Egg Tax <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce yesterday telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry in Nanjing, saying:</p>
<p>Received a letter from the International Trade Bureau stating that, relayed from the Consulate General in Manila, the Fiji Legislative Council's Tax Department plans to increase the import tax on our country's eggs, ham, etc. The proposed increase in tax rates ranges from several times to twenty times. A memorandum is attached, requesting that all export merchants be notified to pay attention and find ways to prevent this. In addition to separately informing the relevant industries to pay attention, the case of negotiating the cancellation of the tax increase should still be handled by the Ministry instructing the consul stationed on the island to handle it locally.</p>
<p>Although increasing taxes is a right of each country, and it is not possible to protest through formal diplomatic channels, the silk merchants of that island can be informed of the mutual benefit of Sino-Fijian commerce, and it can be implicitly indicated that if Fiji increases taxes, our country should also increase the same taxes on the special products imported from that island into China to show opposition, so that they may have some scruples or a possibility of a change of heart. If a method of preventing this is set up here, Shanghai does not have a famous Fiji merchant doing business here, and the Americans also say that Fiji's internal affairs are autonomous and cannot be interfered with, and it is impossible to achieve the effect of national diplomacy. Therefore, we dare to report the facts as they are, and hope for consideration and action.</p>

<p>The Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association received a notification yesterday from the joint donation collection office that donations are booming. The members of the Yarn and Cloth Exchange are working hard to save the country and have repeatedly raised huge sums.

<p>The Baoshan seawall has been in disrepair for many years. After a major incident occurred in July of last year, the government and local gentry attached great importance to it. This year, the Jiangsu River Embankment Project Rehabilitation Committee allocated huge funds to carry out selective construction. The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction appointed Wan Kaijia as the director of the construction office. The construction site is divided into three sections: the first section is at Chenhua Beach in Shizilin, with a length of 189.5 zhang; the second section is at Niutoujing in Xuejia Beach, with a length of 420.0 zhang; and the third section is at Beiwang Temple in Zuowuyuedun, with a length of 150.0 zhang. The above still uses the old-style two-pile two-stone project. In addition, there are more than 330 zhang of cement seawall outer rock throwing projects. All kinds of materials used for wood and stone are purchased by the committee, and three inspectors are dispatched to supervise and accept the work at each construction section to show seriousness. In addition, the seawall embankment was previously dug for military trenches. This time, workers are also dispatched to tidy them up. All projects are scheduled to be completed before September 10th. Since construction started in mid-June, it has been in the dog days, and due to the tide, work is only done for half a day each day. Fortunately, the workers are working hard, and the staff and officers are also able to do their best. It is expected that it can be completed within the deadline.</p>

<p>The Chinese People's Livelihood Self-Help Society is dedicated to solving the social unemployment problem. It has a well-thought-out plan and complete organization. Since its preparation, it has been deeply praised by people from all walks of life. However, since the Shanghai war, all industries have been sluggish and materials have been difficult to obtain. Therefore, the society's fundraising has also been quite difficult. However, the number of unemployed people in society is increasing day by day, and various tragedies are intensifying. The society has the mission of providing relief to the unemployed, and it cannot ignore this. Therefore, it is now actively proceeding with widely soliciting members, not charging membership fees, but only requesting donations of one silver dollar as the society's start-up fund. The method of solicitation is that the society initiates a chain introduction to help people first, and a part of the city's Boy Scouts will volunteer to handle this chain introduction and collection procedures.</p>

<h3 id="e51">Arrest of Kidnapping Suspects by the Public Security Bureau <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Qiao Guanxiang's family, a carpenter residing at Daitieluqiao, Yingjing, west of the Hongqiao Road Airport in Xuhui District, was robbed on the 11th of this month at around 2:00 AM. The owner was beaten and injured, and his neighbor, Gu Yunting, was shot in both legs. Before leaving, Qiao's ten-year-old second son, Xiaoshun, was kidnapped and hidden, and a ransom was demanded in a letter. They agreed to contact them on the 24th, between 2:00 PM and 4:00 PM, west of the railway on Hongqiao Road in Xuhui District. After the owner reported to the Public Security Bureau and the Water Police, detectives disguised themselves and went to the scene. They arrested Song Wanjun and Ma Shifu, who were selling used goods, at the intersection of Yangzhai Road and Hongqiao Road. They were immediately sent to the first sub-bureau of the sixth district. The details have been reported previously. It is now learned that the contact point in this case is under the jurisdiction of the second sub-bureau of the sixth district. Chief Bi transferred all the witnesses to the second sub-bureau of the sixth district. After strict interrogation by Chief Liu, Song Wanjun confessed that he was 25 years old, from Rugao, and lived at No. 900 Fahua Town, and was engaged in the used goods business.

<p>▲ Poor Woman Subjected to Further Rape and Coercion</p>
<p>Yesterday at 6:40 PM, someone hired a car (Shanghai license No. 4235) and forcibly dragged a young woman onto the car at No. 15 Gongyi Lane, Xinmin Road, Zhabei. After she shouted for help, the police on duty at the scene stepped forward and arrested three people, including one woman and two men, as well as the car. They were all sent to the Fourth District Public Security Bureau. After interrogation by District Officer Zhu Ligong, the young woman claimed to be 22 years old, from Nanjing, and living at No. 15 Gongyi Lane, Xinmin Road. She was previously a prostitute. When she was 20 years old, she was sold by Su Qingyun, a friend of her brother-in-law, to Xu Delu, a family member at No. 133 Xinli Street, French Concession, to work as a prostitute. Because she could not stand the abuse, she escaped on April 26th of this year at 12:00 AM. On June 28th, she hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the court requesting to sever her relationship with Xu Delu and restore her freedom. Unexpectedly, at 5:00 PM today, while I was collecting clothes on the drying platform, I saw Xu and three or four companions arrive in a car. They shouted at me from below and forced me into the car. It looked like a kidnapping. Fortunately, after I shouted for help, the police officers of your district arrived and arrested three men and women. The rest had already fled. Although I have already escaped from Xu's place, my bill of sale is still with Xu Delu, so I do not want to file a lawsuit and request to be released for an out-of-court settlement, and so on. Xu Delu claimed to be 38 years old, from Yangzhou, living at No. 133 Dongxinli Street, Xinjie, French Concession, and running a brothel. Liu Guibao was sold to me by her brother-in-law through someone for 500 yuan silver dollars, with a term of four years. The term has not yet expired. When she ran away, I knew that Yang Boqing of Hui Pan Automobile Firm had taken her away, but I had no evidence to talk to him. I met Yang and negotiated with him on Datong Road, but he entrusted someone to come out and mediate, but there was no result. Now Liu Guibao can redeem herself, or she can still go back with me, and I will never force her. I request permission to go out for mediation, and so on. Another person, named Wang Aqing, 41 years old, from Ningbo, living at No. 139 Baker Road, Concession, drives a car for the Yellow Car Company and produced a driver's license. After District Officer Zhu verified the confession, because Liu Guibao had requested an out-of-court settlement, it should be approved. However, Xu Delu's behavior was out of the ordinary, so he was given a light punishment in accordance with the violation of police regulations. Wang Aqing was released without incident, and the car and car license were returned.</p>

<p>▲ Bus Driver Sentenced to Two Months Imprisonment</p>
<p>Liu Decai, a driver from Shandong of the Public Bus Company's No. 251 bus, drove No. 5031, Route 10 bus from south to north at 5:05 PM on the 25th of this month. Near Mugen Road and Wuding Road in Xuhui District, the driver carelessly knocked down Tao Genlong, who was riding a bicycle in front of him, crushing him to death. After investigation by the police, Liu was arrested and detained at the Xinzha Police Station, and Tao was sent to the Fellen Road Mortuary. The First Special Court dispatched Prosecutor Zhang Guangkui to the morgue to examine the body. It was found that the body of the body had been crushed to death. The report was confirmed. The driver, Liu Decai, was suspected of negligence in his duties, and it was ordered that he be immediately detained pending investigation and prosecution by the police. The details have been reported yesterday. It is now learned that the police have now prosecuted him for causing death by negligence in accordance with Article 291 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday morning, Liu Decai was brought to the Second Criminal Tribunal of the Special Court. The police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, gave a detailed account of the investigation, stating that at 5:05 PM on the 25th, the defendant was driving a public bus on Mugen Road near Wuding Road, heading north from the south. The deceased was riding a bicycle in front of him, also heading north from the south, driving on the west side of the road. The defendant honked the horn, hoping that he would avoid him, and at the same time veered to the east to avoid him. Unexpectedly, the deceased also veered to the east, causing the front wheel of the bus to hit the rear wheel of the deceased, causing him to fall to the ground and be crushed to death. Only witness Tang Rusheng witnessed the incident at the time. Tao was sent to Renji Hospital, but he had already died of serious injuries upon arrival. Yesterday, Prosecutor Zhang Chong verified the body and believed that the defendant was suspected of negligence and should be prosecuted by the police. However, according to the results of the investigation by the police, the defendant did not have any major suspicion, and the bus was traveling very slowly at the time. It was actually caused by the deceased's bicycle route being different, and so on. Witness Tang Rusheng also testified to everything. When questioned, the defendant, Liu Decai, testified that his car and the deceased's car were in the same direction, heading north from the south. I honked the horn three times, and the deceased looked back, but at that time the distance between the two cars was quite close. I quickly veered to the east to avoid him, but unexpectedly the deceased also veered to the east, causing him to collide, fall to the ground, and be crushed to death. He also hired lawyer Xu Shihao to defend him. After verification by Judge Wu Tingqi, Liu Decai was sentenced to two months of imprisonment for the crime of causing death by negligence in his duties.</p>

Renfu swallowed saltpeter and acid to commit suicide the day before yesterday. When he was discovered, he was immediately sent to Renji Hospital for treatment, but it was too late. He died yesterday. He was immediately sent home. The incident was learned by the First District Police Station, which ordered Lu Yongde, the local chief of the Sixteenth Pu, to report to the Local Court. Prosecutor Yang and others were commissioned to go to the scene to examine the body and confirmed that he died from poisoning. They instructed the family to collect the body and wait for further processing.</p>

<h3 id="e62">Soviet Gasoline Hits the Market <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>The gasoline market in Shanghai has traditionally been dominated by British and American merchants. However, it has been learned that since the Soviet Union decided to actively promote its products in China, it has established a sales agency in Shanghai on Guangdong Road called You Biandi Petroleum Company, abbreviated as U.R.T. in English. The company recently shipped a large quantity of Soviet gasoline and lubricating oil of excellent quality from the Batumi Oil Station in the Soviet Union on the Steven Wong. To facilitate user access, a gasoline pump has been set up at No. 607 Duoya Road, selling gasoline at one dollar and five cents per gallon. It has also been agreed with the Chinese Guanghua Petroleum Company to be the general distributor of Soviet gasoline. It is expected that there will be intense competition between the three types of gasoline - British, American, and Soviet - in the Shanghai market.</p>

<h3 id="e66">Cremation <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>— A Buddhist</p>
<p>Yesterday's publication included an article by Mr. Zhang Tong discussing tomb improvements. Mr. Zhang's article was in response to Mr. Zhu Yunzong's article on tomb improvements. Mr. Zhang's point was that Mr. Zhu's advocacy of public cemeteries was not economical enough and advocated for cremation. I entirely agree with Mr. Zhang Tong's idea, but I do not fully endorse the methods he proposed. Although cremation is practiced in Japan and some places in the South Seas, I personally feel some unease and find it somewhat inhumane. This reminds me of an old joke:</p>
<p>A man was notoriously stingy and had three sons. As he was dying, he called his sons and asked them, "When I die, how will you handle the funeral arrangements?" The eldest son said, "I will provide fine clothes, a good coffin, and generous offerings." The man angrily said, "You unfilial son! You will ruin our family!" He then asked the second son. The second son said, "I will clothe you in alfalfa, put you in a reed mat, and bury you in the ground." The man said, "That's still too much trouble." Finally, he asked the youngest son. The youngest son said, "I will cut you up, salt you, and display you at the butcher's shop for those who want you." The man said, "That's an excellent method! But I have one request: Ask Uncle Er from next door not to buy on credit, as he has a terrible habit of not paying back!"</p>
<p>This joke scolds the typical miser and may seem overly harsh. However, there may be such stingy people in the world. Although this joke is unrelated to the advocacy of cremation, it shares a similar sense of stinginess and cruelty, so I have written it down here to amuse Mr. Zhang.</p>
<p>However, I have not yet found a satisfactory or reassuring solution to the system of tombs. I am naturally opposed to the old-style tombs, and I find that the current public cemeteries are somewhat aristocratic. We should still find a more economical solution.</p>

<p>— Beard Farmer</p>
<p>When we first tied the knot, our love was immeasurably deep. Every morning, we exchanged sweet kisses, and every night, we shared the same bed. We hoped to grow old together, never counting the days until our hair turned white. But suddenly, a fierce storm of jealousy invaded, and my beauty withered day by day. I could not help but grieve in silence. My meddling sister-in-law, with her sharp tongue that could melt gold, caused my husband to listen to her biased words. My grievances sank to the bottom of the sea. Our love could not be salvaged, and I am now ashamed to be abandoned. I have gathered my dowry, but it is scattered and lost. Heartbroken, I bid farewell to the maids and painfully part with my sleeves. I want to embrace my pipa to leave, but I cannot find a confidant. Where can I go when I step out the door? I wipe away tears as they stream down my face. The man I served is no longer my husband; why should I still be attached? Late at night, as I think of the past, I long to shatter my Phoenix-seeking zither.</p>

<p>| Exploring the Stratosphere |</p>
<p>What exactly is stratosphere exploration? And why was Professor Picard willing to risk his life for it on one occasion (May 27 of last year), a second (August 18), and a third? Most people, especially those who are not scientifically inclined, probably want to know. Please read this brief account:</p>
<p>The primary purpose of Picard's ascents was to measure the relationship between the intensity of "cosmic rays" and altitude. This is of immense value in physics, meteorology, and astronomy.</p>
<p>(2) Contributions to Physics. Among the newest issues in physics, the "mass-energy equivalence" theory can be considered the most important. The transformation of mercury into gold, the condensation of hydrogen into helium, and the possibility of harnessing atomic energy—such as the idea that one gram of energy could power a mail ship across the Pacific Ocean—have all arisen from this. Thus, if research in this area yields significant results, world civilization will inevitably progress from the "petroleum era" and "coal era" to the "electricity era" and finally the "atomic energy era." Around 1903, European physicists discovered radioactive matter. Later, they realized that there were highly penetrating light waves similar to X-rays existing on the surface. According to Milksan's experiments, this light wave was just as strong day and night, and it did not vary with the season. It could penetrate 57 meters of water and 5 meters of lead without any problem. Undoubtedly, it was considered a type of electromagnetic wave with a much shorter wavelength than X-rays. According to Einstein's theory of relativity's "mass-energy conversion formula," Milksan found that when hydrogen transforms into helium, the matter lost in this transformation can emit light waves of the same length as cosmic rays. How meaningful is this coincidence! Moreover, this light gradually absorbs and weakens as it penetrates the outer atmosphere of the earth. It can be seen that the high altitude (stratosphere) above six miles is a good experimental site, and its light intensity should vary with the distance from the ground. Picard's ascents were to find out whether this hypothesis was correct. The results of his experiments must provide new evidence for the "mass-energy interconversion theory." At the same time, the theory of relativity, which shocked the world, will also be proved or challenged by it.</p>
<p>(2) Contributions to Meteorology. In meteorology, especially in the study of atmospheric electricity, Professor Picard's experiments will have great significance. Various meteorological measurements in the stratosphere are one aspect, and the study of atmospheric electricity related to cosmic rays is another aspect. The air on the earth's surface has great insulation, but it also has considerable and measurable electrical conductivity, due to (1) the migration of electrons in oxygen molecules and gas molecules, i.e., the phenomenon of gas ionization, and (2) the effect of the earth containing radioactive substances. However, the combination of the above two is not enough to create the existing degree of ionization in the air, so Milkan believes that cosmic rays are the third cause. Professor Picard's research this time is on the nature of cosmic rays, so he has made some corrections and contributions in this regard.</p>
<p>(3) Contributions to Astronomy. The origin of celestial bodies, especially the origin of the solar system, is still a scientific mystery, and it can be said that it is as mysterious as the question of "the origin of life." Although there are three explanations—the nebula theory, the meteor theory, and the star cluster theory—each has its imperfections. First, let's talk about the sun. It is a hot mass of matter that constantly radiates energy to the earth and other planets. However, according to the shortest estimate of its lifespan, even if it is purely composed of radium, it should have died long ago. The only appropriate answer is the hypothesis of "energy-matter interconversion." Picard's ascents can prove the reliability of the energy-matter interconversion theory, and can also solve the problems of the sun and other celestial bodies. That is to say, whether this cosmic ray comes from the sun, or from a certain place in the universe, so we can use this new argument to further study the sun, or the origin of the sun.</p>
<p>In short, Picard does not want to live a monotonous life leading an annuity, but is willing to endure the cold and heat, and risk the unpredictable. His personal spirit should be admired, and the enthusiasm of the European people can also be praised. At the same time, the Shanghai press also pays great attention to this matter, with large headlines, and its phenomenon is also gratifying.</p>

<h3 id="e69">Suggestion for Improving Wet Nurses <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— Kang Shi</p>
<p>In middle- and upper-class families in our country, due to their wealth, they embrace the philosophy of enjoying life. Therefore, they mostly hire wet nurses to raise their children. However, these wet nurses are generally crude and uneducated, which inevitably leads to improper teaching, causing problems and endless troubles!</p>
<p>The teaching in childhood is the most important, because a person's character depends entirely on the nurturing in childhood. Appropriate parental teaching will produce good children, while inappropriate teaching will create bad children. It is like a factory; only with good machines can good products be produced!</p>
<p>I have seen many wealthy families who have hired wet nurses. However, in some cases, because the child's constitution and the wet nurse's constitution are incompatible, the child suffers from weakness and other diseases, which is extremely dangerous! Moreover, under the tutelage of uneducated wet nurses, of course, the child learns to be a young master, becoming decadent. This is not only a bad phenomenon for the family, but also a crisis for society. Therefore, I have written down the disadvantages of wet nurses and suggestions for improvement below. Are they appropriate? I would like to ask for your wise instructions!</p>
<p>1.  Constitution: Everyone has their own constitution, with differences in heat and cold. In general, people who hire wet nurses only know that the wet nurse's body should be strong and the milk abundant, but they do not examine the constitution to see if it is suitable. Often, the wet nurse's body is very strong and the milk is very abundant, but the child is not fat or exceptionally thin, which is due to the incompatibility of the constitutions. Therefore, I think it should be improved. It is best not to hire a wet nurse, but to breastfeed yourself, because the constitution between mother and child is a natural connection. Do not sacrifice the child by embracing the philosophy of enjoying life! If that is not possible, you should take the wet nurse to a doctor to carefully examine whether she is suitable. In that case, there will be no unexpected accidents.</p>
<p>2.  Teaching: In general, people who hire wet nurses hand over the child to the wet nurse, while they themselves spend their days in leisure. The wet nurse's care, of course, cannot be as attentive as one's own, and most wet nurses are uneducated. Their only principle is to listen to the child, because for the sake of livelihood, they cater to the owner's psychology in every way, not allowing the child's cries to be heard by the owner. Therefore, all the child's demands, toys, candy, etc., are provided to them, not daring to refuse in the slightest. This creates the child's arrogance and gradually fosters pride, and even the parents' orders are disobeyed. This is what the proverb calls the young master's temper! Therefore, I think it should be improved. The owners should often warn the wet nurses not to indulge the child's unreasonable demands, and should add strict rebuke. Moreover, they should not blame the wet nurse at random when they hear the child's cries. In that case, the child will not develop a young master's temper.</p>
<p>Alas!</p>
<h3 id="e70">A College Student <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Ping</p>
<p>Mr. W is a college student. He has all the modern characteristics: a large amount of money, fashionable Western suits, but he considers it a lifelong regret that his parents gave him a less-than-perfect head and a not-so-beautiful face. However, he is determined to adhere to the motto of "Man can conquer nature" and "Buddhas need golden robes, and people need fine clothes," and strives to study cosmetology. Every Saturday and Sunday, he must sacrifice two hours for makeup. His drawer is like a one-stop shop in the French Concession, with razors, Hazelene, Babyface, Stendhal, White Medicine God, wooden combs... even more than the KissProof that women put in their handbags when they go out. He also frankly crosses the line to build roads, preparing everything for great use.</p>
<p>But heaven is not merciful. No matter what, he has never seen a modern girl on his arm.</p>
<p>So he retreated to the second-best option. As long as he sees the words "Ms. XXX, talented student from X Girls' School" in a picture magazine or somewhere, he ignores the consequences and writes sickeningly sweet love letters one after another, until he himself feels embarrassed, and then looks for another target. But his work is like a long-term resistance, with zero effect.</p>
<p>Finally, he had a wild idea and wrote erotic poems in a trivial tabloid. He wanted to use this to flatter the girl of his dreams and make her favor him, saying things like "Adorable woman! You are charming and sensual, you have a fair face, you have blood-red lips, high breasts, and thick thighs, all of which are symbols of your fitness. Ah! Adorable woman, you also feel the boredom of sex." For a time, the slogan of "sex maniac" caused many future female scholars to jointly request the principal to expel him. A piece of paper with the verdict came down, approving the request.</p>
<p>On the night of his departure, he hosted a banquet for many classmates. At the banquet, he unexpectedly gave a generous and passionate speech. "Everyone, I am heartbroken that China's demise is imminent, and those in power have no way to deal with it. What's the use of studying? So I pursue women to temporarily numb my nerves. You must know how painful it is to be a slave of a conquered country! Now..." He raised a big fist and waved it in the air, just like a military officer delivering a speech to kill the enemy. "My dream is awake! Today is our last time together. I am going to the Northeast to join the Volunteer Army, fight for the cause, and die for the nation. Everyone, who is willing to join, raise your hand!" But only his fist was seen extending and retracting in the air.</p>
<p>A week later, his name was found again in a certain wild chicken university, and his erotic poems were still published in a certain tabloid. There was a pair of small pliers and a box of foreign-lettered things in the drawer of his drawer, more makeup products.</p>
<p>Incurable.</p>
<h3 id="e71">A Glimpse of a Training Session <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— Jin</p>
<p>August X to August XX, this is when the XX County XX training session was held. The meeting place was in XX, the location was very suitable, and the transportation was very convenient. Although the training time was only fifteen days, several jokes happened in these short fifteen days. They are excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Some members have a listening sickness. The purpose of their coming is to eat, because they are provided with food and accommodation, so they are very casual about listening to the lectures. After hearing the bell, several members lie down comfortably in bed, this one saying he has a headache, that one saying he has a stomachache, and he also says he has heatstroke, making the host helpless. After the lectures are finished, their illnesses slowly get better, especially when it comes to eating, they still have to eat three or four bowls even though they are sick?</p>
<p>(2) Truancy The members of the XX training session are all elementary school teachers. The young ones are in their twenties, and the old ones are in their forties and fifties, and the lecturers are also very young. In contrast, they can't help but feel ashamed, [this may be my guess] so everyone sneaks out one by one halfway through the lecture. This is a common fact.</p>
<p>(3) Female Comrades One day, several female comrades came from XX. Their faces were the color of goose eggs, their bodies were slender, and their clothes were modern. Suddenly, they attracted the attention of most of the members of the meeting. These female comrades also considered it an honor to listen to an hour of lectures. For this hour, the manpower was very grand, and even the friends who had a listening sickness were cured. But what is the purpose of their listening to the lectures?</p>
<p>Alas! This is the outline of the XX training session.</p>
<p>Degeneration</p>
<h3 id="e72">The Life of a Modern Woman <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>— Jinlong</p>
<p>I have a girlfriend, "She is a graduate of XX Junior High School. It has been nearly two years since she and I separated. Yesterday, I happened to meet her on the so-called mysterious street. In a conversation, I learned that she is working as a mysterious masseuse in XX Massage Parlor on Bazilu.</p>
<p>I said; "Li! Long time no see, how are you?"</p>
<p>She said, "It's embarrassing to say, since I graduated from XX school, because my old father passed away, I can't continue my studies and I can't find a suitable job for a while. To be honest, I'm really ashamed, I'm working as a masseuse in XX Massage Parlor now!"</p>
<p>"Oh! Masseuse" When I heard the word masseuse, I felt strangely uncomfortable in my heart. In my ideal, a massage parlor is a very mysterious den, maybe it is a disguised:::</p>
<p>She said, "I have degenerated! But I can't care about shame, you know that there is only my only loving mother in my family, I have to maintain the life of mother and daughter, and I have to do those lowly tasks, you have to forgive my difficulties,"</p>
<p>I said, "Then how much is your monthly salary there?"</p>
<p>She said, "It's very pitiful, not only do I have no salary, but I also have no share of the commission. All the benefits are taken by the parlor owner. The life of the masseuses depends entirely on the rewards of the customers. As for the price of the rewards, I don't want to say."</p>
<p>After she finished speaking, she couldn't help but shed ashamed and great hot tears, and I also shed tears of sympathy for her, and I parted with her in sorrow, Ah! Masseuse. Poor masseuse!</p>
