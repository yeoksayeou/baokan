<h3 id="c1">法日關係轉變　　又玄 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>日本旣立於金融資本獨占之最前端。乃肆意於經濟獨占的侵略。利用其軍事的優越地位。對吾國盡其力之所能。侵襲我領土。以爲彼之殖民地。是以東北三省自去年九一八事變以後。第一步於本年三月。即已成立「和製「」滿洲」（傀儡）國矣。我國領土被分割。人民被蹂躪。苦乏實力相抗。已成百年對立之局。而日本之對外關係除我國而外。無論美日關係。英日關係法日關係。以至於蘇聯與日本之關係。均因東北問題之擴大而受極嚴重之刺激。英國與日本。不免有種種利害上衝突。而英國本身因自顧不遑。故不能不暫時對日維持其友好關係。且待實際事態之推移。法國自去年九一八後至今年九一八前一年之間。因欲在安南建立其稳固基礎。以便向我滇桂進展。同時更欲借日本之力。封鎖蘇聯勢力之東出。故與日本時取間接微妙的聯络。美國則自日本佔據東北之後。其多年熱望之鐵路投資。與夫黑河流域之廣大潜在市場。均已失之於一旦。且中國失去東北。更加助長日本之基礎勢力。加强日本之競爭力量假使美日之間。一旦發生戰爭。日本據有東北雄厚之天然資源。不難與在東方根據薄弱之北美合衆國作長期爭鬥。是以美日之間。對抗作用愈趨尖鋭絶無融和之餘地。前此美國曾提聲明。勸中日兩國注意事態之擴大。尤不宜蔑視九國公約及非戰公約國務卿史汀生亦曾一再公言美國維持公約之誠意。否認武力侵略。然而空言無補。適足更煽動日本軍國主義之惡燄。故日本公然承認(傀儡)滿洲國之後。美國乃守緘默。</p>
<p>蘇聯與日本之不兩立。無論在立國之基礎理論上。在實際利害上皆甚顯明。且在北滿洲乃東部西比利亞沿烏蘇里鐵路一帶戒備森嚴。故蘇日間時有戰禍迫切之電傳。然而蘇聯人民委員。長在各大會議席上。曾一再聲明。「蘇維埃聯邦對滿洲問題。採嚴正中立態度。實行絶對不干涉主義。警戒一切危險」。且盡其全力以回避蘇日衝突。同時。日首相齊藤實亦對議會公開聲言。「日本固常注意尊重蘇维埃聯邦之正當權益。不令其有任何損害。并確信蘇聯政府必諒解帝國政府之眞意。然而世間乃以滿洲事變爲楔機而吹聽日蘇兩國間將有戰争危機者。誠不勝遺憾。」則蘇日之間。（據當局言論）似又甚爲和緩。至少在短時間内不至發生戰爭。迄於最近。滿洲（傀儡）國造成之後。蘇日之間。緊張空氣。反益鬆弛。漁業恊定旣已成立。而日購人赤油一事。更足以牽引其政治關係之接近。蘇日親近。當然係暫時性質。蓋蘇聯旣精心鋭意於五年計劃之完成。復警戒於反蘇諸國之聯合進攻　。則其外交上之運用。自不能不十分審愼也。况蘇聯欲保持其旣得之基礎。贏取未來之勝利。當此美日對立日趨極端之際。更不能不謹愼且利用美日衝突以取得舉足輕重之地位。是以美國不久之前曾盛倡無條件對蘇後交。其意即在取得蘇聯諒解。如能進一步而美蘇聯合。即足以海陸夾攻之勢使日本屈服。究竟美國經濟助力。大過政治關係。因一部資本家之主張愼重故美蘇復交。又遲遲進行。無如日本十分警覺。被見美蘇兩國漸趨　近。果成立聯盟。則不僅日本在東方霸權地位勢必動搖東北權益。終於不保。即日本自身亦將感受莫大威脅。於是立即轉而與蘇聯表示好感。沿海渔業及中東路利益之外。復進而締結經濟的緊密關係。（購買煤油小麥。）於是旣占經濟的</p>
<p>優勢。復制軍事的機先。五年十年之後而對美作戰。苟蘇聯能絶對中立者。則</p>
<p>日本可以獨霸東亞矣。</p>
<p>此時除美國仍支持傳統政策。努力講求門戶開放之外。尙有法國亦感受重大困難。（一）日本旣承認滿洲（傀儡）國。已現獨占滿洲利益之象徵。所謂「門戶開放。機會均等」之説。將成不兑現之空頭支票。則法國支持日本之</p>
<p>軍事行動。不僅毫無意義。適足以增長日本軍國主義之勢燄『其「標敵」將不在中國而在世界勢力之干涉亞細亞。」則所謂「亞洲門羅主義。」將瀰漫東亞。列國勢力。（法國當亦在内）同被威脅。甚至不免於被擠出中國市塲之外。朝鲜覆轍不遠。能不疑慮。（二）國際聯盟决議。一再爲日本蹂躪。國聯威信掃地無餘。而法蘭西之所以制霸歐洲者全在運用國聯況德國要求軍備平等。提倡（廢棄）修正凡爾賽和約。意大利從而和之法國如果失去國聯作其工具。不僅應付困難。不能維繫中歐諸小國。不能制馭德國不能壓服意大利。且將助長蘇聯威勢。終至喪失其歐洲霸權。是以對國聯威信不能不加以極嚴重之考慮。（三）法蘇對立。固不始於中日衝突。而立國根本之不同。與利害相異。其間以蘇聯同情於德國之「反几爾賽和約」爲尤甚。迄乎九一八事變。法國乃亦注意於滿洲。與日本結成東方之反蘇聯戰綫。而日本此時竟不惜與蘇聯極力聯絡。即無異乎拆散法日之間之一致行動。影響法國國際關係。。常重大。因此法國乃有尊重國聯决議之表示。</p>
<p>法國尊重國聯之表示。維持非戰公約。其非積極行動而爲僅止於一種表示。亦甚顯然。不過處此嚴重局面之下。法國勢必暫時攔起與美國之戰債糾紛乃對英之微妙對立。而求與美諒解，樹立國聯之威信。以國聯之力裁制日本對東北之經濟的獨占。逼使日本實踐前言。「實行門戶開放機會均等」法國必於是取得若干經濟上利益。同時更借此以緊密團結反蘇戰綫鞏固法國在西歐及中歐之絶對優勢。亦即所以壓抑德國。亦即所以制限意大利也。</p>
<p>然而此時之日本。是否即肯俯首就範。安然吐出其東北權益之一部。猶爲疑問。且自美日關係緊張。日早致全力於東北殖民地之穩固。因此對蘇聯諒解。（緃使其爲暫時性質）急切進行而不稍延緩。恐遠在歐西之法國。國際聯盟之運用似已過時。今後日本外交。其聯蘇成分似將大過聯法成分。蘇日新交果愈接近。法日關係即愈遠離。國聯愈要求制限日本之對華侵略。則日本使用蘇聯爲其外交上之工具。亦愈顯明。由此觀察。在短時間内。仍恐日本之利得多。中國之損失大。</p>

<p>（六）程天放</p>
<p>現在舉例來説明、　如甲省正在修築公路若干里、公路修成後、一定需要開公共汽車的若干人、甲省的職業學校就應當開辦汽車班、來造就這些汽車夫、招收小學畢業而年齡在多少歲以上的學生、施以六個月的訓練、使得他們能夠駕駛汽車能夠修理汽車、粗粗了解汽車構造的原理、并且知道各種關於公路和駛行汽車的法律、六個月後考試及格、發給執照、才可以做汽車夫、這種樣造成的汽車夫、豈不比隨便招來的汽車夫高明嗎、如此一方面個人生計問題得以解决、而同時因爲有良好的車夫、公共安寗也更得保障了又譬如乙省是產絲區域要發展絲業改良蠶種和育蠶方法、需要一班人去做這些事、乙省的職業學校就應該開辦蠶絲班、招收小學畢業而年齡在多少歲以上的學生、施以一年或一年半的訓練、使得他們知道蠶種如何選擇、蠶室如何佈置、育蠶方法繅絲方法如何改良不僅是知道、而且是實行期滿後考試及格、發給執照、或者自己去經營改良蠶絲的工作、或者由政府委派到各縣去指導人民改良蠶絲業、如此也是一方面個人生計問題可以解决、一方面社會生產力受了益處、</p>
<p>以上隨便舉了幾個例、此外可以類推職業學校要如此辦理、才可以適應社會的需要才可以增加社會的生產力、這種樣的職業學校是愈多愈好的因爲社會需要那種人牠就開辦那種班、社會的需要已經滿足、牠就隨時可以停辦那種班自然職業學校出來的學生個個都可以應用他所學自食其力了我主張職業學校應該不收學費並再應該多設奬學金額或貸金額奬勵家境貧苦努力求學的學生因爲職業學校的學生、一定大部份是貧苦人家的子弟、國家對於這種人是應該在可能範圍内帮助他們成爲生產份子的</p>
<p>還有許多職業是任何省任何地方都需要的然而職員學校却向來没有注意過、譬如成衣匠不是任何城巿都有的嗎爲什麽職業學校不應社會的需要開設成衣班呢、任何省的職業學校都應該造就大批的成衣匠、招收小學畢業年齡在若干嵗以上的學生授以相當的訓練資質聰明的可以做很貴重很請究的衣服則需要一年半或二年畢業資質較蠢只能做尋常衣服的只要半年或一年就可以畢業、畢業後由學校發給執照或者自己開成店或者到人家家裏做裁縫、這樣造成的成衣匠一定比現在許多没有受過敎育的成衣匠好得多不但可以做衣服、并且可以呌他們負提倡國貨的責任、（因爲許多女太太們衣服的式樣和質地都是有意無意受成衣匠的影響面定的）又譬如廚役旅館裏也要用、機關裏也要用學校裏也要用家庭裡也要用他對一班社會的關係較成衣匠更重要然而如此重要一種職業、却没有人注意完全由一班没有受過敎育的人去擔任、中國各大城巿每到夏秋之際總有時疫發生死的人爲數不少、這裡面一定有一部份是因廚役不懂衛生食物不淸潔以致傳染時疫枉送了性命的所以任何地方的職業學校都應該開設烹飪班招收小學畢業年齡在若干歲以上的學生除了訓練他們的烹飪技能外、並目要使他們有相當的化學智識、衛生智識、、廚房如何佈置食料如何選擇食物如何消毒、微菌如何防患等等資質聰明想做大洒館大旅館廚役的就受二年或三年的訓練資質平常只能司普通烹任的就只要受一年或一年半訓練畢業後發給執照、就可以自營餐館或受人僱用這種受過相當敎育的廚役一定比一字不識的廚役要好得多、不但職業學校造就了社會需要的人而且一班人民的生命一定更加一層保障</p>

<h3 id="c119">孫科發表談話 <a href="#c119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>對於調查團報告書意見</p>
<p>▲有比較滿意之處及絶對失望者</p>
<p>▲仍須政府與民衆努力收復失地</p>
<p>中央社云、國聯調查團報告書節要、已於二日下午八時公佈、中委孫哲生氏、特於昨日下午三時半、在莫利愛路舊宅、招待本埠各報社記者、評讑該報告書内容、孫氏對於該報告書中各點、頗有表示失望之處、茲分誌於后、</p>
<p>▲比較滿意處孫氏首謂、九一</p>
<p>八事變之調查、該報告書記載較爲淸楚、例如(一)第四章内、指九一八事件之發生、該調查團認爲是晚日方之軍事行動、不能視爲合法自術之辦法、(二)日本嗾使東北傀儡、成立僞組織後、即在國際極力宣傳、謂「滿洲國」之成立、爲三省民衆之獨立運動云云、該調查團報告書第六章、亦斥爲「滿洲國」侮在日本軍隊威勢下所組織、不能認爲該地民衆之獨立運動所成立、上述兩點之事實、調查報告、主持較爲公道、亦爲吾人比較認爲滿意之處、</p>
<p>▲絶對失望者報告書第十章所</p>
<p>立解决方案、如(一)建議召集顧問會議、及不主張恢復九一八事前狀熊一點、該點須加以詳密之研究、蓋召集所謂顧問會議、及不主張恢復九一八事變前之東三省原狀、似還就暴力及已成之事實、關於不主張恢復以前之狀態、我人甚屬疑問、該方案此種主張、係指九一八以前中國之統治狀態、抑或指張學良之軍人統治狀態、如指前者、則與其自述有所矛盾如係指後者、則似應明白指出以、免日人之誤解也、（二）關於滿洲之廣泛自治、及顧問會議之組織、其結果將使東三省與中國·或中國之於東三省成名存實亡之統治狀態、蓋在現况之下、日本實有鉅大之勢力、顧問會議之組織、日本因其關係之密切、當得多數席次、是則將來之東三省、名義上雖爲中國領土之一部份、而統治之形式、則爲國際共管、在事實上則爲日本代管耳、此二點、我人表示絶對失望</p>
<p>▲仍須我努力該報告書實有利</p>
<p>益於日本、而我國則僅得其名、乃日本朝野於公布後、一致表示反對、足見日本早具併吞東北三省之决心、𢌞憶甲午之役、中日雙方、承認高覺自立、不數年、日本即反汗、將高麗併吞、此即前車之鑒、今日本併吞東北之决心、旣已暴露、若一味依賴國聯、則僅得到一失望之結果、此際惟有深望政府與全國民衆一心一德、收復東北失地、蓋據本人所見及、東北問題、國聯决不能根本解决、解决辦法、惟有一視吾政府與民衆之努力程度、一視國際間對該案之態度耳、</p>
<p>▲抵貸運動觀　新聲社記者復詢以下列問題、承答如次、（一）報告書主張我國停止對日經濟絶交、其性質爲解决東北問題之條件、實際上、日本侵略東北爲因、而經濟絶交爲果、造因未袪、抵貸運動、何能消滅、（二）調查團之任務、本有確定東北事件之責任問題、但報告書中、不敢確切指出、我國如不以收回東北領土之虚名爲已足、則應準備實力抵抗侵略、於外交上獲得對日利害相同之與國、尤爲必要、</p>

<h3 id="c188">禁止私立高中 <a href="#c188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>敎育局長會議通過的議案之一，禁上私立中學添設高中，這是取締私立中學的一種嚴厲辦法，居然堅决的，勇敢的提出而又通過，大槪距着實行的日子不遠了但是，實行以後，便怎麽様？</p>
<p>近來初中畢業的學生，要考入省立的高中學校，簡直是一座難關；額數不過數十名，應考者動輒七八百名以至近千，這是江蘇的情形；聽説，廣州一帶，尤其擁擠，動輒千名的初中學生，去競爭這數十名的高中學額。這高中的資格，簡直高不可攀，和科舉時代高中一名舉人相仿。每逢揭榜以後，很引起了許多落第者的悲哀，敎他們嘗一嘗科舉時代考秀才的滋味。在這當兒，他們的唯一救星，便是，省立的高中學校，雖然額滿見遺，私立的高中學校，却有餘額可補：這許多落第的初中畢業生裏面，至少總有二分之一，仗着容納在私立高中學校而不至於失學。</p>
<p>假使私立高是實行禁止了，而公立的高中，又不能按照着初中畢業人數的比例，而加以特别的擴大和添設，那麽初中學校畢業一次，社會上便陡添一倍無法讀書的初中畢業生。從前落第的秀才，還可仗着子曰詩云的看家本領，坐一個蒙館度日，現在初中畢業生的程度，能有幾何？文不能測字，武不能挑水，絶了他們上進之階，敎他們老坐在家中做什麽？</p>
<p>諸位敎育局長，會塲辛苦，别來無恙否？請問諸位通過這煌煌議案，還是鼓勵讀書呢？還書提倡失學？</p>
<h3 id="c189">中國的兵 <a href="#c189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— 啟沃</p>
<p>日本鶴見祐輔在他底觀動亂的中國一文中説有一個中國的前任内閣總理的某政治家曾經向他説：「今日的中國，就是中世紀的歐羅巴。比如，你去問問兵士看　你是什麽兵？他一定馬上回答，我是張將軍的兵，我是馮將軍的兵，我是唐將軍的兵。距今三百年前，巴黎的街上有兵隊好爭，問他們是什麽兵，他們或答説，俺是尼舒里敎主的兵，或答俄崙公爵的兵。可是如今怎麽樣，大家都説是法蘭西共和國的兵了。　　「中國是與此相同的，目前兵士們都説是張的兵，唐的兵，馮的兵，到了那時，也許就要答説是中華民國的兵吧，直到那時的到來，現在的狀熊，是繼續着的呢！」</p>
<p>這一段現代中國與中世歐洲的比較談，不但使這些外國的觀察感着深深地興味：就連我們這班國内的留心政治者也覺得這段話確實是道出目前中國的隱處哩！老實説，刻下中國的都市儘管是浸沉於二十世紀資本主義色彩中，中國的政治儘管是掛上許多金字的招牌；然而現今中國的兵還不過是封建時代的武士，中國的軍事領袖無非是封建時代的諸候吧了·姓張的調不動姓馮的兵，正如姓馮的調不動姓張的兵一樣·姓馮的兵是屬於姓馮的，姓張的兵是姓張的，别的人誰也管不着，這與戰轼時代的五霸七雄又有什麽不同？</p>
<p>留着這樣封建典型的兵隊，中國是永遠不會統一的·任你政治上軌道，經濟昌盛，倘若軍人心中還存着門户之見什麽都是白費！我以爲中國兵人有一天能明白他是中華民國的兵，那便是中國眞正統一的時候，中國内戰危機永遠消滅的時候了。</p>
<h3 id="c190">五味人 <a href="#c190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— 孫宗文</p>
<p>酸，苦，甜，辣，鹹</p>
<p>昨天晚餐，在家都不十分滿意，爲的是什麽？爲的是：醋魚太酸，燻鷄太苦，波羅密湯太甜，芥辣鷄太辣，鹽板鴨太鹽，於是這許多的菜，都不合各人的胃口：大家不約而同的説：「</p>
<p>這廚師太不高明了！」</p>
<p>因爲昨天的一餐，於是就連想到我們人類，何嘗也不是如此呢？一個人的精神態度，因爲天賦的本能，生活的環境不同，於是就造成了各不相同的個性來：　正如菜中的有五味一般，不過没有這樣明顯罷了。</p>
<p>（一）酸味人大半爲環境所迫，經多次挫折以後，態度不免寒酸了：這種人，雖然長處在於謙虚，可無狂妄的事情發生；但料他獨辦一件事，不免因爲没有决斷的能力，而抌誤了機會呢！　　（二）苦味人終日心胸抑鬰，臉上不容易看出他的笑容來，言語也滿含着苦意，大槪這一種爲失意，失業，或失戀的人，居多數。不容易希望他的發展！</p>
<p>（三）甜味人時常抱樂觀，善能揣摩人家的心理，以人家的意爲意，他的長處，在於使人不討厭，不過胸無主宰，萬一事情弄僵，也没有辦法啦！</p>
<p>（四）辣味人敢作敢爲，隨便遇什麽的事，他能下斷語有辦法，不顧情面，想到便做，言語至爽而深刻：但他只是倔强，不服人家的勸告，也要把事情愈弄愈僵呢！</p>
<p>（五）鹹味人這種人，説他呆笨，但並不呆笨，説他聰明，又並不聰明：如没有明白的人，好好去指導，前途最是危險哩！</p>
<p>所以人貴中和，偏含一味的人，雖有長處，但不能掩其短，非加以修養不可：不然也如菜味一般的，没有人要請敎呢！</p>
<h3 id="c191">有力量的悲劇 <a href="#c191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— 明夷</p>
<p>包管你看了掉涙</p>
<p>電影藝術的成功，全在感人的力量。像克萊拉寳一流人物，把，『肉』來號召，是無汽謂感人的力量，所以伊們只受一班色情狂的觀衆們的稱頌。</p>
<p>麗琳甘煦的哀婉，安哈婷的悽豔，確有很深的感人的力量。像『復仇』『空谷蘭馨』等片，在觀衆的心的深處，劃下一條不易磨滅的烙印。</p>
<p>這也可説是一件差堪告慰的事！在中國全體女星之中，找不出一個像克萊拉寳的風騒明星，却有一位兼麗琳甘煦和安哈婷之長的悲劇明星，伊是誰？伊便是提倡儉約救國的陳玉梅。</p>
<p>伊在默片時代，已使觀衆有很好的印象，自從主演聲片『芸蘭姑』『一夜豪華』以後,更使觀衆對伊的信仰心加了一重保障。伊幽蘭般淸麗的丰姿，湖水般恬靜的性情，閒鷗般飄逸的態度，充分地在銀幕上表現出來，使人如在一個富有詩情畫意的境界裏，仰觀明月，俯聽流泉。</p>
<p>伊最近主演的『蘭谷萍踪』，是一部描冩封建社會壓迫之下的大悲劇！我敢相信，這節影片假使由别一個演員來主演，至多不過把這個悲劇的故事，一絲不漏的搬上銀幕，就算盡職。但伊委實不止這些！該片前天在新光作非正式的試映的時候，看到最後數幕，幾個心靈脆弱的女子，竟失聲鳴咽了，等到電燈放明，在座的人，眼圈兒全都紅了，記者無論觀什麽悲劇，只有佩服他的藝術好，决不會哭，原因是『聽評書掉淚，替古人擔憂。』未免太傻，但是那天眼眶中竟也有點潮潤，因爲醫院中的幾個特冩鏡頭，給我的刺激實在太深了！</p>
<p>聴説『蘭谷萍踪』不久要公眏了，無疑的！陳玉梅的藝術，當給予我們更深切的認識！</p>

<p>『豈有此理』！他在一時的沉默苦悶之後，暮然撒開了握住伊那雙手，捏着個小　　在空中作勢道：『他們憑什麽就能用買賣的方式，把你斷送給别人作五姨太太，你不會　　你婚姻自主的人權，不承認這種不合法的婚約，與他們正式反抗嗎？』</p>
<p>『這　待你説。』伊苦笑着道：『我當然是不承認他們用這種卑鄙詭　的手段將我出賣；倘不是這樣，我也不來對你告訴和商量了。但你要替我多想想，我一個弱女了，無論怎樣　力反抗他們，總只能在表面上和他們空口相爭，而防備不了他們隨時隨地的　謀毒計；日後危險正多，我不能再待在這火坑裏了！我須要及早躲開他們，自尋我的生路了！』</p>
<p>伊愈説愈興奮，語聲也愈高亢激切；但説到這當兒，忽又改換了一種親昵的口吻，和誘媚的態度，慢慢贴近他身邊，恍惚嬌　無力，直偎欲依到他懹中來。他因爲從來没有經歷過這樣大　的溫存，有些生怯，又礙於園内的游人耳目衆多，怕落下笑話，就一步步的往旁邊退縮。而伊却是情不自禁，偏亦步亦趨的接踵而至，到底終被伊拉牢了他的左臂，將半邊臉兒斜搁在肩頭上，同到亭後一處稍爲幽僻的草坡旁，又軟語著道：『伯勤哥！你還不明白我的心麽？這兩個月來，我在你堂兄英文捕習夜館裡，遇見了你，彼此交成很好的朋友，我顆熱烈的心，殆完全要獻與你了！所差的，只是我這整個身體，尙未正式托出來歸你所有。</p>
<p>如公發生這種危險，稍一不愼，我就會被不相干的人占　了去。當此緊急關頭，我可就不能再那麽因循猶豫，誤我一生；惟有率直的向你表白，求你接受我這處女的眞純的愛情，搭救我離去這罪惡與危險的境界，讓我終身得着你的保護與愛憐，共同創造一個美滿幸福的新生命罷！』</p>

<h3 id="c215">從改良社會説到推進兒童敎育 <a href="#c215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— 成勛</p>
<p>假若認爲「現下的兒童是未來的主人翁」一句是對的話，我願社會上一般父母親長，請多多的對於兒童敎育，下一番嚴格的注意。</p>
<p>兒童的心田是純潔的，精神是活潑的，我們應該如何的滋長他敏鋭的思想，灌輸他豐富的智能？讓他將來替國家建樹，代社會造福，如果因循坐誤專門無意識的不加善良敎育，連接搬演出十三四歲冩長篇累牘的戀愛信，和背家入山訪道成仙的怪劇來，我不禁爲未來國連抱頭痛哭了！</p>
<p>家長們應該先検束自己，家庭裏不絶的麻將纸牌，足以引誘兒童僥倖的心理，僕役成羣，足以𦔳長兒童傲怠的習慣，性情暴燥，口角惡聲，更足以養成兒童倔强勢利的觀念，父母親長，倘使自己都不级排除惡習，如果談到敎育兒童，誠恐兒童未曾受得敎育，而一切不良影象？倒反深深的注射了兒童，我看見社會不少大批寄生蟲，就聯想到這種不負責任的家長們了。</p>
<p>所謂兒童敎育，不一定呆板板的諄諄敎誨，無論隨時隨事，隨地隨物，都有使兒童受到善良敎育的好機會，在下不妨把最需要的幾件冩冩。</p>
<p>一·樸儉耐苦態度公正的修養。</p>
<p>一·基本智識科學見解的灌漑。</p>
<p>一·廉潔精神合羣友愛的栽植。</p>
<p>一·體魄磨練軍事訓導的研習。</p>
<p>我們當然不配比外國社會經濟的富　，兒童敎育設備的完善，所以兒童們的確無福享受高深週密的敎育，但是至少限度，應該屬行上面四則的敎育，來促進兒童的思想，來準備做未來的主人翁。</p>
<p>最後希望一般家長們，不要認爲自己的兒童打勝了隔壁兒童算是有了威勇的精神，不要認爲終日不輟的看飛俠劍仙的小説算是兒童好學的表現，更不要認爲使兒童吃飽着暖呆長白胖算是完了責任啊！你們還需有意識的敎育這一般兒童哩。</p>

<p>— 海紗</p>
<p>本刋科學欄，歷來都關於工業及理化等著述，對於農物學等問題，未詳及之，茲先述「菓樹病症預防法」一文，貢諸本欄，想讀者所樂聞。</p>
<p>國人的栽培果樹，普通皆賴天時地利，聽其自然，於害虫等症，少有相當研究，往往果樹被害，僅知把有害樹皮或樹枝斫斷，或受害的果實摘去，而不知在未生病症以前用藥預防，因摘錄數則，爲園藝家告</p>
<p>（一）梨與蘋菓的腐爛病這種病的發生時，初現紅褐色，慢慢再起水泡，皮帶粘質而很柔軟，常生在蘋菓和梨的枝幹上，在睛陰不定的天氣，最易發生：内有乳白液，漸漸乾枯，就使果和枝都成腐敗。</p>
<p>治法在春初時此病没有發生以前，用「波爾多液」（波爾多液的配合法附後）洒之，可以預防。倘枝幹上有病，須切去燒掉，免提傳染。</p>
<p>（二）梨的黑心病和紅星病這病生在枝上和嫩梢處，成果實上，生在果上的，其果即不端正，且病的地方，會阻止生長，生在葉上的，帶黑色或煤烟色，其黑點成圓形，一碰就脱，能使枝葉慢慢地萎枯至凋落。紅星病狀同，不過色紅，點跡較小。</p>
<p>治法在開花及結果時，亦用「波爾多液」洒之，不過正當一樹梨花盛放的時候，切不可用，只能摘其病葉病果去而焚之。</p>
<p>（三）桃的葉縮病這病生在桃葉嫩梢上面，使葉肥厚而形捲，縮葉的裏層，發現灰白色，患此病輕的僅葉黄而枯落，重的就會停止菓實生長。</p>
<p>治法在桃花將開時，和桃花正開時，與及落花後，各洒「波爾多液」一次，其病即能避免。</p>
<p>附「波爾多液」的製造法　　原料生石炭一斤，酸硫銅（即膽礬）一斤，淸水六十斤。</p>
<p>用具小木桶二只（不能用銅鐵器）大木桶一只，糠篩一只（即篩糠用的竹篩）</p>
<p>製法把二只小桶，都盛水四五斤，一桶置硫酸銅，一桶置石灰，把置硫酸銅的桶，用小棒常攪拌，等到和水化匀，再倒入淸水二十五斤，然後將竹篩置在大木桶上，同時取二小桶之液（置石灰的桶，亦攪成奶白色，並和淸水二十五斤，）從竹篩上倒入大桶中，從篩止的粗質，都棄去，這時再把大桶的液用棒攪之，再用藍色試騐紙（藥房有賣）浸於大桶的液中，如該紙不變色此液即已成功，倘或變做紅色，那末再和入石灰水稍許，使藥性均和，不因過猛而害果樹。</p>

<h3 id="c218">改革娛樂的我見 <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— 銅生</p>
<p>不錯，隨便任何人，應有爲人之需要所謂娛樂，也是我們所不能少的東西，是人生的必須條件，除了生活中的衣食住外，比什麽都來得重要，所以，你看不論中外古今，不分，農工商學，上達至尊，下及苦工，智愚賣不肖等，都各有一種或多種的娛樂。</p>
<p>娛樂的本身條件，是在使我們快樂，是我們在心力勞苦之後的一種補慰精神與舒暢心懹之作用，牠能健强我們的身體與興奮我們的精神而增進我們的事業·牠實與我們有密切關係而不可蔑視的，更不可無的東西。</p>
<p>娛樂的含意與效用，上已言之崖略，但從中國現在社會上的慣性看來，太使我們失望，不但失去了娛樂的本質，并且化而爲無聊的消遣了，在現今大衆所認的娛樂，已經走到畸形的途徑，如看跑馬，賽狗，賭博，花會等等，尤其麻雀一事，來得最爲普遍。</p>
<p>這種不好的社會現象，眞是多得很，我當不能一一舉之而論，現在就以麻雀作代表吧，以上海爲立塲看來，我可武斷的説：會义麻雀的總有十分之六七，而大多數的生活，消磨在這上面，麻雀固然也含有牠的趣味，我們當可從中鑑賞，不過他們於此趣味中，而變爲拜金主義者，竟以此而認爲日常中的事業，來了八圈，又來八圈，今日夜了，明天又來，總想得幾個錢，於是得着下面的結果；</p>
<p>（一）消磨精神</p>
<p>（二）虚度光陰</p>
<p>（三）浪費金錢</p>
<p>（四）疏親慢友</p>
<p>（五）飬成墮性</p>
<p>（六）媒引奸巧</p>
<p>（七）輪錢喪氣</p>
<p>現在社會的不合理性之娛樂，莫不具此數點，可是他們竟樂而爲之，不知自戒，旣得不着娛樂的滋味，反而受着多少的煩悶，甚而傾家棄身，這種自尋苦惱，實是一回可憐的事呢。</p>
<p>以我的愚見，於娛樂上，應有下面的工作：</p>
<p>（甲）消極方面</p>
<p>一，執政者應嚴厲禁止不合理性的娛樂</p>
<p>二，各人自省，拿胡適之先生所説的「爲什麽」來事後自問，</p>
<p>三，政府應查辦無謂娛樂塲所與工具的出賣所</p>
<p>（乙）積極方面</p>
<p>一，政府須極力進行公娛樂的塲　　所如公園，運動塲，電影院，　　遊戯塲等。</p>
<p>二，政府作「有意識的娛樂」的宣傳　　。</p>
<p>三，鼓勵眞正娛樂的模範者。　　四，政府應自行而作民衆的模樣，　　五，家中多備有意識的娛樂工具，　　如風琴，留聲機，棋類，運動　　工具遊戯器具等。</p>
<p>六，一家之長，應作模樣，并指　　　導子弟，防入歧途。</p>
<p>現在社會於娛樂問題，眞是大有改革之必，可是没人覺得，我今提此之用意，也就是希望大家起來，進行改革，至少能使大家注意這個問題，也就是此文的萬幸了。</p>

<p>— 小亨</p>
<p>「王媽，把這鉛八開，付那賣菜底，着他找回八個銅板來。要是哦！不要緊！這鄉下猪　，是不會看洋錢的，上次不是我也照樣付了他啊！不錯！記得他還找我三百多文咧！我却白受用了他」李太太還没把她得意底話講完，王媽已經接了那個鉛角，走出門去。</p>
<p>「喂！賣菜的，兩隻八開拿去，還找八個銅板來。」王媽奉了太太之命，把鉛角付給賣菜底小販，但同時也以憐憫底態度，和不幸底同情，輕輕説一聲「角了看好」</p>
<p>「笑話！府上是老主顧了，那會捉弄我們？」接了鉛角底粘販，因爲聽了王媽底勸告，越發把鉛角都瞧不瞧地，趕緊藏入　　　同　　　速面慌急地，把八個銅板，找給王媽，這是他在極意表示對於她們底信仰，和感激底誠意！　　「猪玀，眞猪玀，嘻！」</p>
<p>王媽在接了八個銅板之後，不自然而冷笑着，根據太太底批評向小販笑駡着，當然還不是輕視他，刻簿他，而實在含有可憐他底蠢笨，和惱怒他底不能領受本人底忠告底兩種意思，然而她旣不能彀很顯明底説出原因，而從向被主顧們稱慣「猪玀」底鄉下小販聽來，還當她在和自己打棚咧。</p>
<p>小販雖不認識鉛角，而鉛角却在兩小時後，就被收印子錢底白相朋友，替牠證明了身分，不用説，收印錢底人，還能收進這等鉛角嗎？結果，小販只得把另外一枚眞角子，換給了他，可是小販一家人底一天生活費，就此完結，小販底妻子，還和丈夫鬧了一次，逼他明天向人家換得回來，又説「上次也是用進一隻鉛八開害得一家餓了一天肚子，要是儘受這樣不生眼睛，全家大小，餓死底日子有咧！」吵了一場，氣得她躺在床上，不肯起來！</p>
<p>鄉下人畢竟有些猪玀脾氣，吃了這個虧，那敢向人索換？第二天一早，賣到李家門口，李太太和王媽都出來喊住了，買了菜付了錢，小販向着王媽嘆口説：</p>
<p>「到底是府上這等人家規矩昨天這位老奶奶，還對我説「角子看好」那知昨天回去，就找出兩角鉛洋來，害得我打了印錢，没了飯錢，可憐我底女人，和我吵了一場，又挨了一頓餓，今天還在生病咧！」</p>
<p>李太太聽了，朝王媽微微一笑，表示她計劃底勝利，王媽却不做聲，等得小販走轉了背，才輕輕嘆了口氣，有聲没力地，吐出兩個字來：</p>

<h3 id="c220">補考 <a href="#c220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— 曼倩</p>
<p>S校在滬上可説是赫赫有名的了！他們對於學生成積不及格的補考辦法是這樣：凡是學生在一學年内有兩種功課不及格的，那麽准予補考，若是超過了兩項，那没有補考而宣布留級了！當然的補考而能夠及格，那就得升級，不然，還是要重讀一年書。</p>
<p>學校當局也很體諒學生的，毎逢到同學剛巧有三項課程不及格的時候，總把成績比較好的一門分數加到了六十分，使他有補考機會，所以幾年歷史上告訴我們，凡是學生留級的，他的功課一定不及格的在三項以上。</p>
<p>補考的舉行，大槪總是在開學後正式上課的前三天，照例每個學生每有一項課程補考，就得繳納一元半的補考費，補考的結果，大槪總是能夠PASS的，因爲在補考的時候，監考並不嚴緊不過一個向來被同學們視爲玩物的敎務員站在那裏，因此儘可以作弊什麽代庖也，窗檻中的飛彈也，抄夾帶也，傳考卷也，……種種都是常玩的把戲：就是眞的不幸，一旦考得成績仍是不行，那麽還可以在没有發表公佈以前，到敎授該課程的敎員去哀求説情：像這學期我所知道的兩個同學關於補考的事情，就是一個好例：</p>
<p>同學C君，他本學期有兩種功課須得補考，可是他對於補考實在認識得太淸楚了，所以寫意得很直等到補考已舉行過後三天才到校，照例没有請假而未與補考的須得留級，再不重行補考了！然而總因F君爲例外，却反而不受試騐無條件的升級了！呵！原因他是敎務主任的外甥啊。</p>
<p>F君也是太大意了，總以爲補考對於升級是不生問題的，所以在暑假裏儘天的都是玩，對於書本子丢在一邊，看都没有看，然而這次却剛剛不巧，在補考××學的時候恰巧碰着校長來巡查，以致一切把戲本領都使展勿出來，結果，祇得硬着頭皮，繳了白卷！當然的，這樣的成績，實在太講不過去了，就是C君自己也知過！最後爲了升級問題，更不得不矮着身子，老着面皮到敎××學的敎員那邊哀求去！在敎員們的心裏，又何肯斤斤較量的來做難人呢？因爲他的一種課程：而就要累你不得升級！於是也就樂得做個順水人情，把白卷遞還F君，呌他到宿舍裏重行冩滿了繳到敎務課去，這樣一來，這難關就解决了！</p>
<p>所以S校是無所謂補考，祗要能夠有補考資格，總是會FASS的，不過毎課要繳掉一元半的補考費罷了！</p>

<p>— 惠</p>
<p>半年來失業的苦痛和悲哀，充塞了他整個的心靈兒：甚麽豪志奢願，統統消蝕盡了！日常，他只是在「盼望」「期待」中生活！候着，候着，今天盼候明天：到了明天，又期望下星期的來臨。然而下星期帶來給他的禮物，還不是「苦痛」和「悲哀」？</p>
<p>親友們逐漸表示了他們鞭長莫及的苦哀。經他懇摯的訴求，最後，他們索性擺起可怖的厭惡的面孔似申斥又像關懹地説：「賦閒在上海，可不是玩的，我們代你籌盤川回鄉去吧」</p>
<p>在上海誠然是絶望了，可是回鄉呢，還不是同樣没有生要機？唯一的希望，他只有開始找報紙上的徵聘廣告了。</p>
<p>「啊，一線的曙光！」當發現一家學校欲聘一位耐勞不倦的敎師的時候，他驚喜若狂，好像勝利之神已投入了他的懐裏來了！於是恭而敬之地具了萬分誠懇和熱望，寫了應徵書親往郵局掛號寄去。第三天，很如願的果然收到回信，信裏大意是説：他們已决意請他去担任高級的級任，月薪二十元，每學期以四個月計算，不供膳宿，每週授課四十小時，并需六十元的現金保，願就的，三日内携欵往洽可也，雖説待遇苛刻得無以復加，但是，他想，比閒着候死强些，况且他素有「不怕忙得苦，只愁閒得慌」的性情，所以工作的沉重，在他是不成問題的；問題就是保證金的來源，使他深深地煩惱和惶急，他不禁忿恨和咒詛人類的殘忍慘酷和虚僞，當小學敎員，也會拐逃不成？他絶無辦法，只有再去和勸他回鄉的親友去商量。經他三整天的奔走，呼籲，哀告哭訴，结果籌得尙不滿二十元。他又深怕躭誤了約期，只得先拿這點錢去與那個學校去商量！求他先收了此數隨後在薪金裏酌扣。但是，他得到的回覆是：</p>
<p>「對不起，恕不能通融，這是敝校董會决議。」</p>
<p>他噙着晶瑩欲滴的淚珠，踏出校門；他想「難道我是生成應該做遊民的嗎！還是社會對我特殊的施與呢？」</p>

<p>現實的虚僞的病態世界，簡直是遍地荆棘，到處黑幕，滑頭事業，欺騙勾當，如雨後春笋，一天多似一天，所演的方法，也越演越妙，倘你偶一不愼，就可鑽它的圈套，但是種種騙局，總不脱用「香餌」，來引誘你入局，所以若要不受人騙，除非抱定一勿貪小便宜」的主義，那嗎，雖有「香餌」在前，也不致上釣，倘使不這樣，而喜貪小利，則在在可以構成被騙的事實！</p>
<p>鄰居施先生，也是一位貪小便宜的朋友，遇着發現不論怎麽有便宜搨的事情，他總搶先下手，圖一個捷足先得，但事實告訴他幾次了，要搨便宜，結果總是反被便宜搨去，不過他雖則碰了幾次，「偷鷄勿着蝕把米」，但是仍舊始終没有覺悟，還是常常在做那「搨便宜」的迷萝，所以這次又出亂子了：</p>
<p>一天，他閲某某報，在廣告欄裏，發現，「贈君可愛之小唱機一座」，的一個便宜廣告，下面還附着一張「茲附上大洋二元，請惠贈愛聽牌小唱機一座，唱片兩張，及鋼針一盒爲荷，此致上海××洋簙廣告部」的贈劵，他看完了喜得直跳起來，以爲只要化兩塊錢的代價，可以得一座唱機，眞是一個空前無上的大便宜了，這種絶妙難遇的機會，豈容錯過，况且可以斷定，這是外國人，（指洋行）要想賣出這個「愛聽牌」的牌了，所以有這樣特别的大犧牲咧，日後它們牌子賣出了，不要説贈送，恐怕連買都買不到呢，他想到這裏，不由的心花怒放，搨便宜的心理，又立刻充分地流露出來，馬上把贈劵剪下，拿了兩塊大洋，跑到郵局裏，去匯滬，他在歸途之上，心下打算，一星期之後，可以一聆名伶的雅奏了？</p>
<p>一星期到了，「愛聽牌唱機」仍舊寂靜地，不見其姗姗而來，祇有在這天晚上，接到了××洋行寄來的，「證明試用劵」一本，他打開一看，見上面冩着：「此證明試用劵,每册八張,君可扯下,贈與君之八個親友,待君之親友均持劵,並均附大洋二元,再向本行索取此種試用劵後,即可贈君愛聽牌小唱機一座,唱片」’他看完了,連喊:「觸霉頭,觸霉頭,又是上當了」.</p>

<h3 id="c224">半年來之美國汽車營業槪况　　摩亞 <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>▲上海情形相反羣趨樂觀</p>
<p>美國之汽車貿易。在本年開首之六個月中。其成績之低落。爲近多年來所未有。而上海之情形則正相反。汽車經售商咸極樂觀。其營業狀况大都良佳或滿意也。若輩所經手之一九三二式新車。登塲之時。互有久暫之别。然在今春一二月滬戰之後。淸淡之七八兩月前。其營業殊爲猛進耳。上海之汽車銷售。今年與去年相較。大見進步。目下雖詳細之數目報告無從取得。然據各經售商稱。除一家處於例外外。無不較一九三一年爲有利。今年登塲之各式新車。改革之處頗多。英製汽車亦多革新。兩美旣具。滬上各著名汽車商行。莫不受惠。營業總額爲之增色不少。此外則更有以最低售之汽車響購衆。亦爲去年所未有者。</p>
<p>據本埠汽車經售商稱。本年正月份凡手頭已有一九三二年式新車者。營業均達上乘。蓋當時爭競爭之花色甚少。而其勁敵又遲遲不到。車之價値爲之大增。故今年新正其營業乃上增不已。有突高儕載之勢。不幸滬戰爆發。美滿之希望爲之　散。但其中亦有若干商行趁此時機。將舊存之貨。及無人顧問之老式車脱售一空。二月份之汽車貿易。除軍用上之出路外。全部爲之停頓。三月份戰事告終。營業沉悶之至。惟於月終則稍有起色。蓋當時滬人士之欲購汽車者。大都觀望不前。有所佇待也。</p>
<p>四月份之營業一躍上昇。此蓋戰後之反應也。此項漲風直至五月六月而不少息。六月份之賣買略現滯鈍。七月份亦見去胃淡薄。八月份之滬上汽車商業殊有復興之勢。各經售商均爲之鼓舞不已。對於以後數月咸抱樂觀。其時又有若干經售歐洲汽車之商行。雖其所代銷之汽車。未具美製各種汽車之特殊優點者。亦佔相當之優勝。此因由於處用上之經濟。用油之省便。及購買者之愛國心熱。競買其本國所造之汽車。有此數端理由。而不列顚及大陸所製造之汽車乃在滬暢銷矣。美國於此時期中。其情形與上海適相反。此半年乃爲汽車營業中經久未見之最劣時期。今年開始之六個月中。汽中註册數。除喬琪亞州外。總數爲六五五·七六四輛。此數目離一九三一年底最保守者所估之數。相去尙覺甚遠。福特廠之出品中間曾停止四個月。據專家言此爲銷售上减小之主因。但亦非爲出品跌落之最大原因。至其低落之原因大半係受經濟衰落之賜耳。欲知美國客用汽車之低落。最宜與一九三一年之產額相比較而觀之。去年開首之六個月汽車註册數爲一·一六一·六八九輛。一九三二年及一九三一年之第一個半年相比較。相差之數爲五○五·九二五輛。跌落計百分之四十三又五。</p>
<p>據上海所接得之正式計數觀之。一九三二年半年來之各種汽車，以雪佛蘭之二一五、八一一輛最多居魁首。雪佛蘭銷數佔全部百分之三十二又九。超過居於次位之福特。其數量爲一零三、○○○輛。福特之百分數爲一七·二。順風牌即潑萊茅斯。以浮動力鳴於時。其總數量爲六二、四二九輛。佔總數百分之九·五。其次在十位以内者爲璧克·鮑恩台克·道琪·克雷斯勒·斯蒂倍克·第沙多。及哇爾特斯摩别爾。通用汽車公司仍居分類之最多數。計車輛六種。總數爲三零七、○一六輛。克雷斯勒摩托居次位。數量爲一一六、零七五輛。（去年計超一三、五五四輛。居第三位。）福特林肯居第三位計一一四、四七五輛。斯蒂倍克。批斯亞鹿。及羅克尼居第四位（去年居第六位）。註册數爲二七、六五六。去年上半年同時爲三零、三八八輛。此類除克雷斯勒而外。一九三一年顯佔較高之百分數。他類之總數如次。赫特森愛山克斯二一、八四一輛。惠萊士哇浮蘭乃脱一六、五二八輛。奥奔考特七、一零六輛。</p>
<p>若以各個車輛之註册數比較之。則今年上半年中以順風牌及第沙多兩車爲最佔多數。故就事實而言。克雷斯勒爲僅得增長之一類。其超先數爲四二·六五七輛。第沙多增一·三八二輛。六月份之註册數爲四七·五三七輛。較之五月增加百分之一三·六。然較一九三一年六月則減少百分之二六·一。此爲年中月計最佳之月份。乃由於福特之出品較五月增長二九·五九五輛。若以全部事業計則祇增一七·六九六輛而已。六月份福特之註册數爲五二·七九五輛。較之其他各種汽車爲最多。除阿干蕯斯·麥萊蘭·米西西貝·蒙他那及達科達士諸州外。均以福特佔首位。若上述之各州則雪佛蘭略佔優勢。福特於六月份所佔總數之百分計算爲三五·八。雪佛蘭爲二四·九。五月份福特佔總數百分之一七·九。雪佛蘭佔百分之三十。此種顚反之勢完全由於福特八缸車上市而造成。故六月乃達其頂點。雪佛蘭以四月爲最多計有四四·八八○輛。</p>
<p>潑萊茅斯六月份之註册數爲一六·六一八輛。（佔全數百分之一一·三）。在美及各州（除喬琪亞未悉外）均位居第三。鮑恩台克爲五·○二六輛。（佔全數爲百分之三·四）。在國中佔第四。其他則祗在二十二州中居第四位。其他各種汽車在各州居第四位者。計　克十六州。道琪及羅克尼各三州。納許及第沙多各二州。奥奔及愛山克斯各一州。此爲前十位之次列。在福特之外。自五月而上昇至六月增多者。祇有兩種而已。其一爲奥奔增加一·五○○輛。佔百分之二一·五。二爲惠萊士乃脱增約百分之二十二。福特之較五月增長二九·六○○輛。約計百分之一二七·二。潑萊茅斯爲今年六月較去年增加之僅有車輛。其所增之一二·七五○輛汽車。約計百分之三三○。六月份之註册數三十四州均有進步之徵。哥倫比亞區亦包括在内。計本薛文尼亞增三·一○○。加立福尼亞二·七○○。米西根二·四○○。紐裘賽三·○○○。哇海屋及德干司一·一○○。紐約雖仍爲各州之冠。但註册數較五月少去三四○輛。伊利諾少一○一輛。其他跌落之各州。計爲干薩司。米乃沙太。北卡洛立那。及但尼西等處。米西根·哇克拉在買·哇崗·及華盛頓各處其六月份之汽車註册數。較去年同時爲增進。然此四州这增加總數共計不過一·五○○輛而已。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Change in French-Japanese Relations   You Xuan <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Japan is already standing at the forefront of financial capital monopoly. Thus, it wantonly carries out economic monopolistic aggression. It takes advantage of its military superiority. It does its utmost against our country. It invades our territory to make it its colony. Therefore, since the September 18th Incident last year, the three northeastern provinces, as a first step, established the "Made in Japan" "Manchukuo" (puppet) in March of this year. Our country's territory is being divided, and our people are being trampled upon. We lack the strength to resist, and a situation of a century of antagonism has already formed. Furthermore, Japan's foreign relations, aside from our country, whether it be American-Japanese relations, British-Japanese relations, French-Japanese relations, or even the relationship between the Soviet Union and Japan, have all been severely stimulated by the expansion of the Northeast problem. Britain and Japan inevitably have various conflicts of interest. However, Britain itself is preoccupied with its own affairs, so it cannot but temporarily maintain its friendly relations with Japan, and await the development of the actual situation. France, in the year between the September 18th Incident last year and the September 18th Incident this year, wanted to establish a solid foundation in Annam, in order to advance towards Kwangsi and Guizhou. At the same time, it wanted to use Japan's power to block the eastward expansion of Soviet power, so it took indirect and subtle contact with Japan from time to time. The United States, after Japan occupied the Northeast, its long-cherished railway investment and the vast potential market in the Heilongjiang River Basin were lost in one fell swoop. Moreover, China's loss of the Northeast further boosted Japan's basic power and strengthened Japan's competitive strength. If war were to break out between the United States and Japan, Japan, with its rich natural resources in the Northeast, could easily engage in a long-term struggle with the United States, which has a weak base in the East. Therefore, the antagonism between the United States and Japan is becoming increasingly acute, leaving no room for reconciliation. Previously, the United States had issued a statement urging China and Japan to pay attention to the expansion of the situation, and should not disregard the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Secretary of State Stimson also repeatedly stated publicly that the United States maintained its sincerity in upholding the treaty and denied armed aggression. However, empty words are of no avail, and only serve to further fan the flames of Japanese militarism. Therefore, after Japan openly recognized the (puppet) Manchukuo, the United States remained silent.</p>
<p>The irreconcilability between the Soviet Union and Japan is very clear, whether in terms of the basic theories of nation-building or in terms of actual interests. Moreover, in northern Manchuria, the area along the Ussuri Railway in eastern Siberia is heavily guarded. Therefore, there are frequent telegrams about the imminence of war between the Soviet Union and Japan. However, the People's Commissar of the Soviet Union has repeatedly stated in major conferences: "The Soviet Union adopts a strictly neutral attitude towards the Manchurian issue, implements an absolute non-interference policy, and is wary of all dangers." And it is doing its best to avoid Soviet-Japanese conflict. At the same time, Japanese Prime Minister Saito Makoto also publicly stated to the parliament: "Japan has always paid attention to respecting the legitimate rights and interests of the Soviet Union, and will not cause any harm to it. It is also convinced that the Soviet government will understand the true intentions of the imperial government. However, it is regrettable that the world uses the Manchurian Incident as an opportunity to propagate the impending war crisis between Japan and the Soviet Union." Therefore, the relationship between the Soviet Union and Japan (according to the authorities' statements) seems to be very harmonious again, and at least no war will break out in the short term. Until recently, after the creation of the Manchukuo (puppet state), the tense atmosphere between the Soviet Union and Japan has become more relaxed. The fishery agreement has already been established, and the purchase of oil by Japan is even more sufficient to attract the approach of its political relations. The closeness between the Soviet Union and Japan is of course temporary in nature. Because the Soviet Union is devoting its efforts to completing its five-year plan, and is wary of the joint attack of anti-Soviet countries, its diplomatic operations cannot but be very cautious. Moreover, the Soviet Union wants to maintain its existing foundation and win future victories. At a time when the opposition between the United States and Japan is becoming increasingly extreme, it cannot but be cautious and take advantage of the conflict between the United States and Japan to gain a pivotal position. Therefore, the United States not long ago strongly advocated unconditional diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, with the intention of obtaining Soviet understanding. If the United States and the Soviet Union could further unite, it would be enough to make Japan succumb with the force of a sea and land pincer attack. After all, the economic assistance of the United States outweighs its political relations. Because some capitalists advocate caution, the restoration of diplomatic relations between the United States and the Soviet Union is delayed. However, Japan is very vigilant and sees that the United States and the Soviet Union are gradually approaching. If an alliance is formed, not only will Japan's hegemonic position in the East inevitably be shaken and its Northeast interests will eventually not be guaranteed, but Japan itself will also feel a great threat. Therefore, it immediately turned to express goodwill towards the Soviet Union. In addition to the coastal fisheries and the interests of the Chinese Eastern Railway, it further concluded close economic relations. (Purchasing kerosene and wheat.) Thus, it already occupies an economic</p>
<p>advantage and preempts military opportunities. If it wages war against the United States after five or ten years, and if the Soviet Union can remain absolutely neutral, then</p>
<p>Japan can dominate East Asia.</p>
<p>At this time, in addition to the United States, which still supports traditional policies and strives for the open door, France is also experiencing great difficulties. (1) Japan's recognition of Manchukuo (puppet state) has already shown a symbol of monopolizing Manchurian interests. The so-called "open door, equal opportunity" theory will become an unfulfilled check. Then France's support for Japan's</p>
<p>military action is not only meaningless, but is also sufficient to increase the strength of Japanese militarism. "Its 'target' will not be in China, but in the interference of world powers in Asia." Then the so-called "Asian Monroe Doctrine" will permeate East Asia. The powers (including France) are all threatened, and may even be squeezed out of the Chinese market. The repetition of the Korean experience is not far away, can they not be worried. (2) The resolutions of the League of Nations have been repeatedly trampled on by Japan, and the credibility of the League of Nations has been completely swept away. The reason why France dominates Europe is entirely due to the use of the League of Nations. Moreover, Germany demands equality of armaments and advocates (abandoning) the revision of the Treaty of Versailles. Italy follows suit. If France loses the League of Nations as its tool, it will not only be difficult to cope with, but also unable to maintain the small countries of Central Europe, unable to control Germany, and unable to suppress Italy. It will also increase the power of the Soviet Union and eventually lose its European hegemony. Therefore, it is impossible not to give serious consideration to the credibility of the League of Nations. (3) The opposition between France and the Soviet Union did not begin with the Sino-Japanese conflict, but the fundamental differences in nation-building and the divergence of interests are particularly serious because the Soviet Union sympathizes with Germany's "anti-Versailles Treaty." Until the September 18th Incident, France also paid attention to Manchuria and formed an anti-Soviet line in the East with Japan. However, Japan at this time does not hesitate to contact the Soviet Union as much as possible, which is tantamount to breaking up the unified action between France and Japan, affecting France's international relations. . Often heavy. Therefore, France has expressed its respect for the resolutions of the League of Nations.</p>
<p>France's expression of respect for the League of Nations and its maintenance of the Kellogg-Briand Pact are obviously not active actions, but only a kind of expression. However, under this serious situation, France is bound to temporarily shelve the war debt dispute with the United States and the subtle opposition to Britain, and seek understanding with the United States, and establish the credibility of the League of Nations, in order to use the power of the League of Nations to restrain Japan's economic monopoly of the Northeast, and force Japan to implement its previous words. "Implement the open door and equal opportunity." France must then obtain certain economic benefits. At the same time, it will also use this to closely unite the anti-Soviet front and consolidate France's absolute advantage in Western and Central Europe. It is also to suppress Germany. It is also to limit Italy.</p>
<p>However, whether Japan at this time is willing to submit and safely spit out part of its Northeast interests is still questionable. Moreover, since the relations between the United States and Japan are tense, Japan has devoted its efforts to stabilizing its Northeast colony. Therefore, it is eager to understand the Soviet Union (even if it is temporary in nature) and proceed without delay. I am afraid that France, which is far away in Western Europe, and the use of the League of Nations seem to be outdated. In the future, Japan's diplomacy seems to have more pro-Soviet components than pro-French components. The closer the new Soviet-Japanese friendship becomes, the farther the French-Japanese relationship will be. The more the League of Nations demands restrictions on Japan's aggression against China, the more obvious it will be for Japan to use the Soviet Union as its diplomatic tool. From this observation, in the short term, I am still afraid that Japan will gain more and China will lose more.</p>

<p>Ji Handong, Commander of the 60th Route Army of the National Salvation Army in Peiping, led 2,000 troops to launch a fierce attack on Suizhong on the 2nd. More than 300 Japanese troops retreated. The National Salvation Army occupied Suizhong. The enemy suffered heavy casualties and shot down two enemy planes. They temporarily withdrew due to exhaustion of ammunition and no reinforcements. (Special telegram on the 4th)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Ma's Troops Prepare for Long-Term Resistance Against Japan <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>According to people from outside the Guan in Peiping, Ma Zhanshan intends to transfer from Rehe to western Liaoning and Yuguan to resist the enemy for a long time. It is unknown whether the government will allow it or whether Rehe will allow it to pass through. Wang Delin's troops are scattered in the forests in Dunhua and Yanji areas in eastern Jilin, appearing and disappearing unpredictably, preventing the Japanese from repairing the Jihui Road, and threatening the southeast of Jilin. A senior Japanese military officer gave a speech saying that he could not see the Wang army from a distance, nor could he see the Japanese army from a close distance. Feng Zhanhai's troops have no fixed base, so the Japanese are overwhelmed. The troops are responsible for attacking the northwest. The puppet organization has almost no income and only relies on Japanese loans.</p>
<p>Maintaining the status quo, no one pays land tax, and the tax cards have been suspended due to the disturbances of the volunteer army. Railway income is even more unreliable. The coastal road is only thirty or forty miles open to traffic, and the daily income is only 50 national currency. The Jidun Road can be open to traffic for five or six days a month, and the income is far less than the expenses. Nineteen bridges on the road were destroyed by the volunteer army. The other day, a Japanese military vehicle overturned and sank into the river when it passed the Jiaohe Bridge, killing more than 40 Japanese soldiers. The Jihai, Sitao, and Taoang Roads are open and closed from time to time. Puppet education is based on respecting Confucius, restoring the ancient ways, and the politics of kingship. Most of the higher primary schools read the Book of Filial Piety, and the middle schools read the Doctrine of the Mean and the Great Learning. The rebel army is dominated by Zhang Hai's troops and is called the Mongolia-Tao Frontier Defense Army, and the rest are garrison troops or guards.

<p>Weihaiwei – The Taikoo Company's Zhoushan steamer ran aground on a certain island near here on Saturday night and may be completely lost. Since yesterday, the west and north winds have been strong, and the wind has become stronger today. The sea is turbulent, and even the rescue ship must enter the port today to temporarily avoid the weather. The climate is harsh, and no ship dares to sail within a mile of the location of the Zhoushan's accident. However, using a telescope from the high ground on the hillside, it appears that the front part of the Zhoushan has been broken by waves and is sinking. Only the rear part remains, but it is also being hit by huge waves constantly. Now, at high tide, the deck is half submerged in water. Once the tide rises, it is feared that it will be completely submerged. It is also unknown whether its front is still unbroken and only completely submerged in water. However, regardless of the situation, the ship will definitely not be able to withstand the constant pounding of huge waves in its current state without being completely destroyed.</p>
<p>Weihaiwei – According to continued reports, the Zhoushan steamer could still be seen this afternoon and has not been completely submerged. Its front is still firmly grounded in its original position, but its rear has tilted backwards and the rear mast is still above the water. A Japanese tugboat tried its best to approach the outer island with a sampan and rescued the remaining seamen and one crew member from the Zhoushan ship, a total of seventeen people. The gale has not subsided yet. (4th Day Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>General Nomura's Trip to the US Called Off</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Washington, 3rd – There are various indications that the US government is generally satisfied with the Lytton Report, but officials are unwilling to immediately issue criticisms, wanting to see what actions the League of Nations will take first. Stimson spent the entire day at home thoroughly studying the report, then met with President Hoover for an hour to discuss it, and then returned home to review the report again.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Washington, 3rd – The sudden appearance of important Chinese figures in Washington in recent days, who have secretly met with important US government officials, has attracted considerable attention here. It is believed that the Chinese government wants to use the favorable parts of the Lytton Report. Qian Zhaoji, the former Chinese ambassador to the UK, is currently visiting important US figures here. According to an official from the Chinese embassy, Kong Xiangxi, the former Minister of Industry, is also on his way here. In addition, Li Jinlun, the former Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, is also traveling to various countries, specializing in visiting important figures and foreign experts. The purpose of their meetings has remained secret to this day. As for the Lytton Report, after in-depth study, US officials and diplomats from other countries feel that if the League of Nations fully approves the Lytton Report, the rift with Japan will deepen. Several people believe that the report contains a practical opinion that the League of Nations does not need to severely condemn Japan. If this is the case, Japan will at least temporarily sever relations with the League of Nations. The State Department has not yet made a formal statement on the report. All parties are eagerly awaiting Stimson's attitude. Observers believe that Stimson will be able to make a statement within a few days. It was recently heard that several representatives of American merchants have met with Li Jinlun and several Chinese in this area one after another. Although it is unknown whether what they discussed is related to Manchuria, people in Washington are paying more attention to the Lytton Report and the situation in Manchuria as a result.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Washington, 3rd – According to the Japanese ambassador, the Japanese government previously planned to send a "goodwill" delegation to the US, led by Admiral Nomura, but this has been called off because the eye injuries Nomura sustained in the Shanghai bombing have not yet healed.</p>

Baron Go Seinosuke, president of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said that the report obscures the facts.

<p>▲ Japan United News, Tokyo, 4th – The Japanese government and the public are singing a chorus of condemnation against the Lytton Report, saying that it has abandoned the original mission of the investigation team. At today's cabinet meeting, the government indeed launched a denunciation of the report. After Minister of War Araki reported on the situation in Manchuria, three ministers questioned the reaction of various countries to the report. Foreign Minister Uchida replied that the opinions of the various countries' media had been published in various newspapers. The authorities are also currently collecting information from various sources and will report it upon completion. After the Foreign Minister's response, all cabinet ministers pointed out the errors in various chapters of the report and criticized them. Minister of War Araki said that the report is completely based on insufficient knowledge and is nothing more than a travelogue. We do not need to mind it and should move forward based on the established policy. Minister of Colonial Affairs Nagai and Minister of the Navy Okada also criticized it for its insufficient knowledge. The Japanese government's countermeasures and policies will be considered by each cabinet member and then re-discussed at the next cabinet meeting.</p>

He is scheduled to discuss with Japanese Foreign Minister Uchida Kosai in Tokyo on the 18th to discuss how to deal with the League of Nations. It is heard that Xie (traitor) is bearing a very important mission of national betrayal this time, which can be roughly divided as follows: (1) To restrain the United States and the League of Nations, adopt a friendly attitude towards Russia. For example, if Japan is unwilling to sign a non-aggression treaty with Russia, the pseudo-government will sign it alone with Russia, and request recognition of the pseudo-government. Japan can also withdraw and be in a free position to manipulate internationally. (2) Discuss the issue of abolishing extraterritoriality. (3) Discuss the issue of economic integration between Japan and the traitors. (4) Discuss the issue of preferential tariffs between Japan and the traitors.</p>

Furthermore, the British government is not prepared to offer criticism or opinions on this matter before it is submitted to the League of Nations in October.</p>

Mr. Lytton also said, "According to Japan's opinion, since 'Manchukuo' is already independent, the measures outlined in the report will not be recognized by that country." He did not find this opinion strange. Mr. Lytton said, "We had already heard this opinion in Tokyo. However, if the various reasons stated by Japan are rejected by the world, difficulties will arise. Japan declares that 'Manchukuo' was created automatically, and Japan has concluded a treaty with the new country, therefore Japan cannot discuss this issue with other countries." Lord Lytton and his wife then went to a villa in Hertfordshire.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 3rd – After arriving in London, Lytton told a Reuters reporter that anyone who reads the report will know that the investigation team was moved by a sincere love of peace and did not meticulously determine who was right and who was wrong. He hopes that world statesmen, the League of Nations, and newspapers can follow the guidance provided by the report. Japanese opinion is that the establishment and independence of "Manchukuo" has made it impossible to accept the investigation team's recommendations. He does not find this opinion strange, as the investigation team had already heard this said by the Japanese in Tokyo. However, it is not yet known whether this Japanese view can be accepted by the world. What he can say now is that he hopes that China and Japan can use the materials from this report to create future peace.</p>

<p>Sir Frederick Whyte's Unique Perspective on the Report</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 4th – A reporter from the Manchester Guardian today interviewed Sir Frederick Whyte, who has been a political advisor to the Chinese government since 1929 and is currently in England, regarding the Lytton Report. Whyte said that what is implied but not stated in the Lytton Report is that China itself urgently needs to actively reform, while the path taken by Japan violates its international obligations. The essence of the report is that it is a statement asking Japan to reconsider its policies. The focus of today's difficulties lies in Japan's intention to preemptively recognize "Manchukuo" in order to hinder any possible action by the League of Nations. The current difficulty for the League of Nations and the United States is to find a way to reiterate Lytton's request to Tokyo, that is, the Japanese government should reconsider whether Japan's current policy is indeed in Japan's own interest. In his opinion, Japan will soon realize that it is in a very dangerous and isolated position, unable to simultaneously anger Russia, slight the United States, and disregard the League of Nations. Moreover, it is becoming increasingly clear that Chinese public opinion will never allow its government to recognize "Manchukuo," and the righteous armies opposing "Manchukuo" will continue to receive supplies of weapons and money from within the customs. As for the Lytton Report's statement that the path to peace in the Far East lies in internal improvement in China, it is also well said.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Geneva Newspaper Comments on the Report, Pointing Out Two Important Points <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>▲Reuters, Geneva – A Geneva newspaper criticized the Lytton Report, saying that the report found two extremely important things: first, the September 18th Incident was purely an excuse and did not show that the Japanese military operations in Manchuria had legitimate self-defense characteristics; second, the people of the three eastern provinces unanimously deny the new country. Given these premises, the measures outlined in the report are difficult to reconcile with this, as Chinese territory is still occupied and direct negotiations are difficult to accommodate. However, since appropriate safeguards are in place and the League of Nations is participating, this report does contain a solution.</p>
<p>[P German Newspapers Seize the Opportunity to Exaggerate</p>
<p>Believing the Report Has Little Value</p>
<p>Spare No Effort in Criticizing the League of Nations</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, Berlin, 3rd – German newspapers unanimously criticized the Lytton Report, considering it to be unconscious empty talk with no hope of resolving the issue of the Eastern Provinces. In particular, it is regrettable that the report contains the seal of the German representative, Mr. Hiney, given that Japan had already presented the accomplished fact to the world before the investigation team signed it. The extreme right-wing Kreuzzeitung stated that the report is a wonderful article of one hundred and sixty pages, and concluded by asking how much benefit the German representative's signature on this verbose and powerless document of the League of Nations brings to the German nation. It is doubtful, as Germany has little interest in maintaining the prestige of the League of Nations, as Germany's own relationship with the League of Nations is likely to face extremely serious problems soon. The German newspaper Germania, affiliated with the Central Civil Service faction, predicted that Japan would oppose the Far East Conference proposed in the Lytton Report, as Japan's early recognition of "Manchukuo" has clearly indicated its absolute unwillingness to consider reconciliation by the League of Nations. Therefore, when the League of Nations Administrative Council convenes in November, it will encounter an extremely difficult problem: will the League of Nations let Japan withdraw, or will it repeatedly concede to Japan's demands? Both will damage its prestige, but the severity will vary slightly. The German General Newspaper stated that Japan cannot be expected to welcome the Lytton Report, but in reality, Japan has obtained the best conditions. If Japan had not first seized Manchuria, the Lytton Report would not have been produced. Then where would the League of Nations' terms of reconciliation come from, where would the economic expansion from Manchuria to the whole of China come from, and how could it build autonomy and remove its military equipment in the three eastern provinces, where would the economic benefits come from, and how could it have close political relations with a dangerous and unstable neighbor? The entire German media feels that although the United States and Soviet Russia are not members of the League of Nations, future changes will all be influenced by them. Furthermore, the United States has clearly made efforts to reach an understanding with Soviet Russia, and the future attitude of the United States towards the Sino-Japanese dispute and other international issues will depend on the success or failure of this move.</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, Berlin, 3rd – Observers of Far Eastern affairs here mostly believe that Japan's recognition of the puppet state of Manchukuo has rendered the Lytton Report virtually worthless. It is expected that the Western powers will now attempt to reach some kind of compromise in order to avoid putting pressure on Japan. German newspapers mostly view the Lytton Report with indifference. For example, the Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung even called it "another deception of the League of Nations," believing that the League of Nations can only do more paperwork. Vorwärts, on the other hand, called the report a model of political realism, acknowledging that the weak have been trampled by militarily powerful countries, but the right to correct this still rests in the hands of those who violate the law.</p>

<p>Italy Remains Silent on the Report</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 4th – Today, French newspapers commented on the Lytton Report from the perspective of supporting the League of Nations. Le Temps stated that the investigation team clearly did not have the power to use the law to stop the conflict, and the League of Nations also had no way to act. Therefore, people must strengthen the League of Nations and not insult it. Le Figaro and L'Ami du peuple both denounced the League of Nations' lack of power in the issue of the three eastern provinces.</p>
<p>▲Havas, Paris, 3rd – Today's editorial in Le Temps highly praised the Lytton Report, considering it to be absolutely fair. The newspaper detailed the course of the conflict and carefully analyzed its responsibilities, then concluded that "The Lytton Report can make the discussions in Geneva in November clearer and open a path to compromise in principle. In short, the conclusion of the report is that Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations seems to be something that should not happen."</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Rome, 3rd – Italian officials did not issue any criticism regarding the Lytton Report, and Italian newspapers did not write a single word commenting on this report.</p>

The Privy Council's written opinion states: (1) The Research Department must be the Diplomatic General Staff and be attached with significant authority. (2) The director of the Research Department cannot be concurrently held by the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs; a capable diplomat must be selected. (3) The Research Department must widely recruit talent. It is heard that the Foreign Minister has little opposition to this opinion. The new director will be Mr. Yoshida, the current ambassador to Italy, and the vice director will be former minister to China, Mr. Shigemitsu.</p>

<h3 id="e75">A Railway Plan in America That Shocks The World <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Constructing a Transpacific Railway that Circles the Globe</p>
<p>Developing the Great Resources Between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans</p>
<p>According to Japanese newspapers, the United States is attempting to advance into Asia and construct a transpacific railway that circles the globe. The following is a translation of news from the Nagasaki Nichinichi Shimbun. In order to realize its Pacific policy, the United States is gradually extending its wings towards the East. This can be seen from the recent attitude of the United States towards the Manchurian issue. Now, in order to develop Asia, the United States is investing huge sums of money and not hesitating to spend long years to achieve the success of the plan, which is to build a transpacific railway that circles the globe, starting from New York, and develop the great resources between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The country had previously sent personnel to explore the Weideng Garden in the Gobi Desert and planned a twenty-year project. It has also repeatedly sent Mongolian expeditions. Recently, Dr. Andrews, the leader of the expedition and director of the New York Museum of Natural Sciences, presented the conclusions of the exploration of Mongolia and suggested laying the transpacific railway, reporting on the course of the actual measurement. The plan in the report had already emerged twenty-one years ago, when the World Railway King Harriman's Chamber of Commerce undertook this project and recruited famous experts from around the world to design and investigate it. The estimated capital is 100 million yuan. The outline of the design is as follows: starting from New York, along the coast of San Francisco, Canada, Nome in Alaska to the Bering Strait, laying an underwater railway, connecting St. Lawrence Island, and landing on the Chukotka Peninsula north of Kamchatka, crossing the Stanovoy Range, heading north to the coast of the Sea of Okhotsk, connecting the Siberian Railway in the Khabarovsk region, branching south to Nikolaevsk, and branching again in Nikolaevsk, passing through Jilin Province in our country, connecting the Chinese Eastern Railway to Vladivostok and the Pacific Mail Steamship route. On the other hand, a branch from Harbin passes through the Nanmao starting station south of the Heilongjiang River, enters the north of Jehol via the north of Taonan in Liaoning, then enters Inner Mongolia to the east, then passes through the five prefectures of the western Chahar, Zhulumu Qin, passes south of Wulanxiyemuer to reach northern Suiyuan, then crosses the upper reaches of the Yellow River, the Gangmu River, and enters Ningxia, passes through the north of Jiji Salt Pond in Ningxia, passes through Liangzhou in Gansu and enters Qinghai, then passes through the south of Qinghai's Lake Koko Nor, crosses the Tianshan Mountains north of Xinjiang, goes south into Tibet, crosses the Karakoram Mountains, crosses the Babir Plateau, passes through Kabul and reaches Persia, from Persia connects to Baghdad in Mesopotamia, crosses the Tigris River and reaches Turkey, via the Black Sea coast to Constantinople. Such a great plan, it is heard that the United States has signed a contract with the world's richest man, Rockefeller, but due to various complex international relations, it is still unknown whether it can be realized.</p>

<p>▲The Han and Liu armies bombard each other with heavy artillery</p>
<p>▲The fighting is extremely fierce, and the losses on both sides are unknown</p>
<p>Jinan correspondence: Liu Zhennian's army, in addition to Liu himself holding Yexian, his deputy division commander He Yisan is guarding Laiyang, forming an asymmetrical defensive posture. As for the Qixia area, it is heard that Liu's army has indeed withdrawn, and there are currently only two or three hundred militiamen and police from the Public Security Bureau guarding the city. The city can be recovered as soon as the provincial troops arrive. In the Muping area, there are still remnants of Liu's army. Two battalions of special troops were transferred to Laiyang yesterday to reinforce the defense. In addition to the cavalry brigade of Li Xuande, which has arrived in Yantai, the provincial troops are also being filled in by Xie Shuxian of the Southern Shandong Militia. This unit arrived in Zhaoyuan on the 26th, Huangxian on the 27th, and Penglai on the 28th. Recently, it was heard that they have arrived in Fushan. All areas are still peaceful. In recent days, Liu's army in Yexian City has been challenging the provincial army from time to time. This afternoon, a telegram came from Shahe saying that the two armies had indeed had a major conflict and artillery battle, which was very fierce. The aftermath will be more difficult to handle. The telegram is as follows: "The front-line defense of the Han and Liu armies clashed at dawn today, bombarding each other with heavy artillery. The artillery fire was extremely fierce, the smoke was thick, and the scenery was indistinguishable. It was the first and most intense artillery battle since the incident.

<h3 id="e80">Guo's Troops Capture Longgang <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>▲ He Chengjun Immediately Departs to Supervise the Troops</p>
<p>▲ Bandit Leader Xie Hanxun of Central Hubei Handed Over for Trial</p>
<p>Hankou dispatch: The various bands of Red bandits in Hubei Province have been routed by the National Army advancing on multiple fronts. Over the course of several months, all important towns have been successively recovered. Only the isolated area of Longgang in southern Hubei remains in the hands of the bandits. This area belongs to Yangxin County and, like Yanxia, is an old stronghold of Kong Long's bandit gang. Surrounded by high mountains and blocked by small rivers, it is strategically important. The bandits have been entrenched there for six years. The county borders Jiangxi and provides easy access to Hunan, allowing the bandits to flee and reappear at will. This has become their common tactic. This time, the National Army launched a large-scale bandit suppression campaign. Because of the power of He Long and Kuang Jixun's factions, heavy troops were dispatched to annihilate their main forces. On the southern Hubei front, Guo Runian, Zhang Gang, Rong Jingfang, and other units advanced to suppress the bandits. Since May, they have successively recovered Yinzu, Liurenba, Tongcheng, and other places. A month ago, Minister He Yingqin convened a bandit suppression conference in Nanchang with the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, dividing troops to block and suppress the bandits on multiple fronts. After recovering Sanxikou, the remaining bandits suffered heavy losses and were cut off from communication. One group fled to the border area between Wanzai and Liuyang, while another group fled into the old stronghold of Longgang. Guo, Zhang, and other units launched a continuous campaign towards Longgang. Because the bandits defended the river, they could not advance directly. On the morning of the 2nd of this month, Division Commander Guo Runian personally led the 26th Division, erected pontoon bridges, and crossed the river under the cover of machine guns. The bandits fired fiercely from across the river. The officers and soldiers bravely advanced, crossed the river through a hail of bullets, occupied the position, and dispersed the bandits. In the afternoon, the unit searched and advanced towards Luojia Ferry, discovering more than 1,000 Red bandits in the mountain flanks on both sides. They resisted stubbornly, but were encircled and annihilated. The bandits in Longgang, relying on the bandit troops defending the front and the treacherous mountains and forests, were unprepared. That night, Commander Guo dispatched troops to attack Longgang. The dispatched unit, the 76th Brigade, consisting of about four battalions, was led by Brigade Commander Huang Hanxun and set out at 2:00 AM on the 3rd, traveling quickly and lightly. They soon arrived at the location. The bandits, caught off guard, fought desperately in hand-to-hand combat for several hours. By 11:00 AM, the bandits could no longer hold out and fled to Yanxia. At 12:00 PM, Guo's troops completely occupied Longgang. Both sides fought with their main forces in this battle, and many bandits were killed. Even more were captured after the occupation. The troops are now joining forces with friendly forces to advance towards Yanxia, with plans to capture it on the 4th. The group that fled to Liuyang and Wanzai will be dealt with by the Hunan Army. It was previously said that He Chengjun would personally go to southern Hubei to supervise the suppression of Kong's bandits. Although the bandits have been defeated, the remnants still need to be cleared. It is said that he will depart in the next few days to supervise the pursuit and annihilation of the bandits, ensuring that they are completely wiped out. However, the administrative office may cease its organization. In the eastern Hubei area, since the recovery of Jinjiazhai, the bandits have been completely defeated. Recently, they regrouped the remnants and fled west from Yingshan on the 2nd. Division Commander Hao Mengling discovered this and ambushed them in the eastern and western areas of Tuanpo. Taking advantage of the bandits' hasty retreat, they launched a surprise attack from the intersections of Lukou, Dajiaji, and Luotuo Ao, cutting them into several sections and killing more than 1,000. Even more were captured. In addition, Commander Tang Enbo searched and suppressed bandits in Pengda Bay, Hejia House, Longjia House, Gaoshan, and other areas. In Pengda Bay, they defeated 7,000 to 8,000 remnant bandits. According to captured bandits, Longjia House was occupied by the pseudo-Macheng Independent Division. They immediately advanced towards the village and surrounded it. More than 400 Red bandits resisted stubbornly but were ultimately eliminated. More than 100 Mauser and infantry rifles were seized, and more than 300 bandits were captured. The eastern Hubei area has been largely cleared. However, when Jinjiazhai was recovered, the remaining bandits fled in disarray. It is feared that a few scattered bandits may have fled to various places, hoping to revive their cause. On the 3rd, it was rumored that bandits had been discovered in the Huanggang area. The authorities have dispatched troops to suppress them. The Second Fleet of the Navy has also dispatched the Weisheng warship from Wuhan to cruise the Tuanfeng and Huangshigang areas to assist the army in blocking and suppressing the bandits.</p>
<p>In the central Hubei area, it was rumored that He's bandits were in Yichang. In reality, they have indeed fled to Yangping, which belongs to Yuan'an County. This area has been repeatedly harassed by He's bandits. In addition to the National Army's advancing units, including Liu Maoen, Xiao Zhichu, and Fan Shisheng's units, which have established a tight encirclement on three sides, the Sichuan Army's Guo Xun, Zhang Bangben, and Fan Shaozeng's units are also following and pursuing on multiple routes. They are currently in a tight encirclement and will be resolved soon. Wang Yiming's bandit unit and the pseudo-independent regiment still have more than 2,000 men. One night, they fled from Sunqiao to Longdang, hoping to join forces with He's bandits. Xiao's division, together with Yu Zhaolong's brigade and Zhang and Li's regiments, pursued and suppressed them. Fu's regiment ambushed and blocked them at Guanqiao. Zhang and Li's regiments pursued them to Sanyangdian on the 2nd and launched a pincer attack, annihilating most of them. The remaining bandits continue to flee north and are being pursued vigorously. The Honghu area has been declared clear. The National Army has successively seized more than 7,000 Mauser and infantry rifles, more than 60 machine guns, and more than 30 mortars. All important leaders have been captured. With the exception of Lu Yi, who was executed on the spot with the approval of Xu Yuanquan's headquarters at the request of the people, the rest were escorted from Xindi to Wuhan on the evening of the 2nd by Liu Ao, the chief of the military law office, for detailed interrogation. They include: Ma Wu, the second chairman of the pseudo-Hunan-Hubei-West Provincial Soviet and director of the Political Security Bureau; Zhou Meitong, the chairman of the pseudo-Provincial Soviet; Wang Wensuan (female), the secretary of the pseudo-Women's Department; Zhao Zunyi (female), the secretary and teacher of the pseudo-Lenin School (wife of Zhu Mianzhi, an important Communist Party member); Li Yezhong (female), the secretary of the pseudo-Lenin School (wife of Liu Luoxia, an important Communist Party member); Zhang Shenming, the political secretary and military doctor of the first hospital of the pseudo-hospital special branch committee independent regiment medical office political department; Zhang Huichuan, the secretary of the special service regiment of the pseudo-7th Division; Zhu Xianzai, the traffic officer of the pseudo-Fu County district; Peng Mingdeng, the propaganda officer of the pseudo-County Committee; Lei Ziquan, the propaganda officer of the pseudo-County Government; Peng Zhifa, the handyman of the pseudo-Provincial Committee; Hu Shaomin, a staff member of the radio station and Red Flag newspaper; Duan Yuheng, Duan Dechang's paternal uncle; Duan Liujin and Duan Qijin, paternal cousins; Duan Yongshi, Duan's grandmother (over 70 years old); Duan's aunt; Duan Wuxian, Duan's younger sister; Duan Chuanzhi, Duan's young daughter (child); Hong Juzun, Duan's divorced wife; and Meng Guirong, Duan Liujin's wife.

<h3 id="e81">Dredging the Huai River and Opening Waterways to the Yangtze River <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>▲ Constructing Three Dams for Easy Opening and Closing</p>
<p>▲ Proposing to Issue 9 Million Yuan in Public Bonds</p>
<p>Zhenjiang dispatch: The Huai River diversion project has been underway for more than a month since resuming on September 1st. According to the revised plan for splitting and diverting the river into the sea and the Yangtze River this summer, both the sea and Yangtze River routes should be undertaken simultaneously. However, due to insufficient funding and labor shortages, the work in the past month has focused on dredging the section from Lianshui County to the sea, the waterway to the Yangtze River has not been considered yet. Currently, because the first step of the flood discharge project is an urgent and crucial task, the Huai River Diversion Committee has converted 9,000 tons of disaster relief wheat allocated by the National Government last year into 300,000 yuan in cash from the Ministry of Finance. This money will be used to hire an additional 3,000 workers to dredge the waterway to the Yangtze River, continuing the work-for-relief method. The committee has already recruited 2,000 workers from Bengbu and Wuhu in Anhui Province. The remaining workers will be recruited locally. As for the Yangtze River project plan, it has been decided to first discharge the excess water from Hongze Lake into the Zhangfu diversion river to enter the canal. Two branches of the tailwater will be opened in the southeast of Hongze Lake to enter the Gaobao and other lakes. New-style movable dams will be built at the junctions of the Zhangfu diversion river and the two branches of Hongze Lake. When the lake water is high, the dams will be opened for discharge; when the lake water is low, the dams will be closed for storage. This will benefit the originally planned first step of flood discharge, second step of irrigation, and third step of navigation. The Qingjiangpu Works Bureau operated a Huai River Diversion Training Class in Pu in 1928 to train junior technical personnel for the Huai River diversion into the sea. The training lasted six months and achieved good results. The Works Bureau also plans to follow the previous example, but with an emphasis on the Yangtze River direction. The bureau is now actively preparing and aims to establish the class within the shortest possible time. However, the Yangtze River water system is very complex. Although the initial dredging project has begun, the downstream waterways still need to be carefully surveyed. Twenty-two engineers from the bureau organized a survey team on September 27th, divided into hydrology, surveying and mapping, and geology groups. They departed on September 30th to the Gaobao Lake area to conduct surveying and mapping and drilling to test the soil quality. However, the newly excavated river channels for both the Yangtze River and the sea require the purchase of 120,000 mu of farmland. The Huai River Diversion Committee has also established a land administration bureau within the Qingjiang Works Bureau to carry out land acquisition. The second batch of tools ordered from the United Kingdom arrived in China in mid-September and have now all arrived in Pu. It is said that this batch of tools is worth about 3 million yuan, which has been deducted from the Boxer Indemnity water fees by the Ministry of Finance. The Huai River Diversion Committee believes that since the Yangtze River project has now begun, funding must be secured in order to achieve complete success. The first phase of the project this year requires 16 million yuan, but it is difficult to allocate this amount at a time when the government's finances are exhausted. However, at least 9 million yuan is needed to maintain operations, so the committee has petitioned the National Government to approve the issuance of 9 million yuan in public bonds to meet the needs.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Supreme Court Denies Southwestern Branch <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>The Supreme Court today informed Lu Sihui, the President of the Guangdong High Court, that: The Supreme Court received Instructed Word No. 160 from the Judicial Yuan on September 29th, stating that: "Upon reviewing the Southwest Political Affairs Committee's consultation and report on the resolution to establish a Southwestern Branch of the Supreme Court, the court has already responded, requesting that the resolution be revoked and informing the court on file. Now, according to Lu Sihui's report, the Southwest Political Affairs Committee has appointed him to concurrently manage the administrative affairs of the Southwestern Branch of the Supreme Court, and he is following the organization's establishment. The establishment of a branch has not been approved by the court, so how can it be established on its own? Any judgment made by this illegal organization is naturally deemed invalid. In addition to consulting the Southwest Political Affairs Committee again to quickly revoke the branch, the Ministry of Justice must also be informed to instruct the high courts of the Southwest provinces to comply." Upon review, the Southwest Political Affairs Committee's resolution to organize a southwestern branch of the Supreme Court lacks a basis in both law and reason, and will only create disputes. It has already been submitted to the Judicial Yuan for review based on law and fact and rejected in detail. The Judicial Yuan and the Ministry of Justice have successively consulted and rejected the request to quickly cancel the illegal organizational resolution in order to avoid disrupting the judicial system and maintain the spirit of unity. Now, according to the report, it has been organized and established on its own, which is extremely inappropriate. According to the court's organization, there is a statutory system, and it cannot be disrupted at will. Since the law has been established, the entire country should jointly maintain it. Moreover, those who hold judicial responsibilities should be especially careful to abide by and set an example for the masses, so that the rule of law can be achieved. An illegal organization like this has no basis of its own, and yet it wants to execute judgments and hear grievances. How can it be believed by the people? In order to maintain the rule of law and the unified judicial system, the court must abide by the instructions of the Judicial Yuan. The establishment of the branch as presented is not approved. Any judgment made by this illegal organization is naturally deemed invalid according to law. In addition to the Judicial Yuan consulting the Southwest Political Affairs Committee again to quickly revoke the branch, the Ministry of Justice must also be informed to instruct the high courts of the Southwest provinces to comply.</p>

<p>As Long as Heaven Rains</p>
<p>At four or five o'clock in the afternoon of the tenth, three or five of us went out of the west gate of Hancheng for a suburban tour. We saw that the crops in the fields, such as corn and millet, were very flourishing, which made us often feel that the suffering endured by the people of Shaanxi over the years was not entirely due to natural shortcomings, but suffered great losses in terms of human affairs. The countryside has been completely bankrupt, and most of the harvest that farmers painstakingly obtain in the fields every year is not enough to pay the various taxes. Therefore, they no longer want to farm and flee to various places.</p>
<p>"Are your village chiefs good?" we asked a farmer carrying a hoe and about to return home while walking.</p>
<p>"Alas, there are many bad ones, but there are also those with conscience," the old farmer replied with a sigh.</p>
<p>"Why don't you sue the bad village chiefs?" we asked the old farmer sincerely again.</p>
<p>"We have no money and don't know anyone, who dares to sue him?" the old farmer replied again.</p>
<p>"Now, do you have any difficulties or painful things? Please tell us honestly," we asked again.</p>
<p>"As long as Heaven rains, no matter how much money the officials want, we are willing to give it. Other than that, we have no more difficulties,"</p>
<p>The old farmer told us very sadly and thoughtfully.</p>
<p>"Is your current county magistrate good? How does he treat the common people?" we asked him again.</p>
<p>"Oh, I dare not say. He is the parents of the common people, I dare not criticize him," the old farmer replied hesitantly.</p>
<p>After listening to the old farmer's few words, we all sighed to each other, "The Chinese people are really good people, but..." In this way, we walked listlessly for more than ten minutes and then approached the dormitory. After dinner, representatives from all walks of life in the local area met with us and provided us with some general information about Hancheng.</p>
<p>Hancheng was once the ancient state of Han and the state of Liang. In the Spring and Autumn period, it was called Hanyuan. The states of Qin and Jin once met here in battle. In the eleventh year of Qin Huiwen, it was renamed Xiayang. Wang Mang of the Han Dynasty changed it to Pseudo-Ji Pavilion. It belonged to Huashan Commandery in the Jin Dynasty. Hancheng County was established in the Qing Dynasty. At the beginning of the Tang Dynasty, the prefecture and county were abolished. At the end of the Tang Dynasty, it was renamed Hanyuan. After the Five Dynasties, the Later Tang restored Hanyuan to Hancheng, which belonged to Tongzhou. The Jin Dynasty considered it Zhen Prefecture, but the Yuan Dynasty abolished it and assigned it to Tongzhou. The Ming Dynasty followed this. In the third year of Yongzheng in the Qing Dynasty, it was changed to a directly governed prefecture. In the thirteenth year, it was promoted to a prefecture. Now it is Hancheng County. There are many places of scenic beauty and historical sites. Liangshan is ninety li northwest of the county, stretching east and west. The shape of the arch is like a roof beam. There is a stone pagoda, a Luohan cave, and a spring called Tianjing and Longjing. There are also east and west valleys. Longmen Mountain is sixty li northeast of the county and was dug by Yu to connect the Mengjin River estuary. It is eighty paces wide, with traces of chiseling on the edge of the cliff, and the legacy of his work still remains. The water of the Yellow River flows down from the top of the mountain like boiling and surging, as fast as a bamboo arrow, and four horses cannot catch up. The west cliffs are all broken mountains and cliffs. Fish gather under Longmen, but thousands cannot ascend. According to legend, only the divine dragon can cross, hence the name. The Two Stone Treasures are at the foot of Sanlei Mountain, where hermits live. The South Stone Treasure of the side creek is beside the creek water. Elephant Mountain is twenty li west of the county. The mountain rises and falls like an elephant drinking from a pool. Hengshan is twenty li northwest of the county. The mountain stones are uniquely beautiful, and there is a stone cave where the Daoist Second Hejing Yuan ascended to heaven. Five Zhi Mountain is in the middle of Wanshan, with deep rocks and distant valleys, rarely visited by humans. There are east, west, north, south, and middle five zhi. The mountain has many pine trees and spring water. Susuan Ancient Trail is winding and tortuous, the location of the tomb of Su Wu of the Pseudo-Han Dynasty. In addition, there are the Phoenix Mountain, Xiangshan Mountain, Peony Mountain, Ape Mountain, Lion Ridge Mountain, Horse Head Mountain, Shendao Ridge, MaRidge, Zhu Sha Ridge, Wenjia Ridge, Bailin Cave, and Niuxin Gorge, all of which are very famous. The largest waters are the Yellow River, fifteen li east of the county, flowing in from Yichuan. The Gushui River is hundreds of li north of the county, the Jushui River is one li southwest of the county, the Taoqu River is more than ten li northwest of the county, the Huachi Pool is seventeen li southwest of the county, and the Wenshui River is twenty li north of the county. Canal administration has been extremely emphasized since ancient times, and thousands of good fields rely on it for irrigation.</p>
<p>Hancheng County covers an area of ​​about one hundred li from east to west and about one hundred and ten li from north to south. There are the magical traces of Yu Gate, the fragrant grass of the Han Shrine, the dark color of Su Cen, the high tomb of the Grand Historian, the ancient road of Hanyuan, the wild geese of the Great Wall Fortress, the willows of the embankment of Shaoliang, the afterglow of Gaomen, the cloud temple of Xiangshan, the sparse mirror of Yuanjue, the misty rain of Hengshan, and the twelve scenes of Zuoyuan Tanghua. In addition, there are the Shenyu Temple, Zixia Temple, Houtu Temple, Chen Ping Temple, Grand Historian's Temple, Su Wu Temple, Guo Ziyi Temple, Eight Immortals Cave, Laozi Cave, Leishen Cave, and Sima Slope.</p>

<p>The county has 16,000 households, with a population of more than 92,000 people. There are more than 1,130 households in the city and near suburbs, with a population of more than 10,000 people. The people's lives are very simple, and each person needs about four or five yuan a month to survive. The city is square, with each side about three li long. There are about 170 shops in the city.

<p>There is one junior high school and three complete elementary schools (one for girls, one vocational, and one general) in the city. There are two complete elementary schools outside the city and about 170 or 180 primary schools. The middle school has about 160 students, the complete elementary schools have about 380 students, and the primary schools have about 6,000 students. The educational expenses are about 2,300 yuan per year from land rent and house rent, about 3,200 yuan per year from miscellaneous taxes, and about 14,000 yuan per year from the financial bureau.

The salaries of teachers and staff are 30 yuan per month for the middle school principal, 15 yuan for the director, 5 jiao per hour for the teachers, 24 yuan for the elementary school principal, and about 20 yuan for the teachers. Except for the middle school teaching English for five hours per week per grade and the elementary school for one hour of English, the courses are the same as other schools. Folk schools have been suspended since the famine and have not yet been restored. The director of the Education Bureau had a student strike in May and was driven away, and has not yet been officially appointed. Other situations are omitted due to time constraints.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Investigation of Hancheng Coal Mine, Etc. <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Before 9:00 PM on the eleventh, the members of the delegation who investigated the Hancheng Coal Mine and the Longmen Water Conservancy returned one after another. The coal mine team arrived at Shijia Gully at 11:00 AM on the tenth, and arrived at Quanzi Gully at 8:00 PM. There was gas in the mine, and because they were not prepared, the gas almost ignited when it touched the light, and their lives were almost lost. On the eleventh, the investigation of the Qiaoer Gully and Xigou two coal mines were in good condition. The investigation of the Hancheng coal field is as follows:</p>
<p>The Hancheng coalfield has good quality and a flat seam, bordering the Yellow River in the east, making it a place of great interest to mining surveyors. The investigation is described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Shijia Gully Coal Mine. The mine is located 18 li north of Hancheng County. Coal is extracted using an inclined shaft, which is three and a half feet high and four feet wide. The mine tunnel is winding and generally opens to the northwest, with an inclination of 20 to 40 degrees and a straight depth of about 40 zhang. The coal seam is about one and a half feet thick, trending north-northwest to south-southeast,</p>
<p>Inclined to the southwest. Each worker can mine 600 to 1,000 jin of coal per shift. The wage is about 4 jiao per person per day, or 150 copper coins per worker (the exchange rate is 400 coins per yuan). Each puller can pull eight times a day, each time pulling about 40 or 50 jin. The wage is about 4 jiao. Food and lamp oil are provided by the workers themselves. Each person uses about 6 liang of oil per shift, costing 1 jiao and 2 or 3 fen. The price of coal sold at the mine is 1 jiao and 5 fen per dou (80 jin), or about 3 yuan and 2 jiao per ton.</p>

<p>On the way back, the water conservancy team was told a recent story by villagers: Previously, bandits in the suburbs ran rampant everywhere, extorting money and kidnapping people, which was very vicious. So the rich fled and the poor waited for death. In the end, the people could no longer bear it, so they made hundreds of red-tasseled iron spears and resisted the bandits with all their might. As a result, they killed more than 200 bandits in the first battle, and the bandit scourge has since disappeared. Alas, resistance, resistance, is the only bright path for us to survive!</p>
<p>Originally, our return journey was supposed to go from Dali to Sanyuan and then to Xi'an, and then report to Huashan from Xi'an. Looking at the map, we circled a huge elliptical circle, and many people thought that,</p>
<p>This way of walking is not cost-effective in terms of time, energy, and economy. Therefore, on the evening of the eleventh, we all decided to report directly to Huashan from Dali. After the report is completed in four or five days, people with free time can wander around Xi'an for a few days, and people who are busy with official business can take the train that has not been seen for more than a month, as fast as a hurricane, and return to their sweet hometown.

<p>▲Provincial Order to Investigate Rice Production. The rice harvest in various villages and towns this year is still considered abundant, so the rice market is gradually falling. Now, at the time of the early rice harvest, the price per stone is 7 or 8 yuan. In the future, the late rice harvest will be no more than 6 or 7 yuan. Low grain prices hurt farmers, which is of great importance to the rural economy. Moreover, recently, the domestic rice market has been manipulated by foreign markets, and the harvest in Hangzhou and Shaoxing this year has been poor. The province is restricted by the order prohibiting exports and cannot adjust the surplus. Now, Zhu Yuanzhi, chairman of the Songjiang County Chamber of Commerce, has submitted a request to the Department of Civil Affairs, asking them to consider the hardships of the people and allow the ban on rice exports to be lifted in order to maintain the hardships of farmers, etc. The Songjiang County Department of Civil Affairs ordered the county government to report on the harvest and market conditions this year, as well as the surplus or deficit situation in the past year, for review and decision.</p>
<p>▲Extension of the Land Price Tax Deadline. The deadline for the first installment of the land price tax was set for the end of September by the provincial order, and late payment fines would be levied. The announcement is on file. Now, various institutions such as Kuangchan are requesting a one-month extension to ease the tax burden and increase tax revenue. The County Finance Bureau has specially ordered both to continue collecting the first installment of the land price tax before receiving the department order.</p>

<p>▲Clearing Overdue Land Tax. The overdue land tax in this county has been a long-standing issue. Various institutions and local gentry have organized clearing committees to carry out clearing work. At the last local administrative meeting, local gentry Ruan Xiyao and others were again elected as clearing committee members to organize a clearing committee to hire accountants to carry out active clearing. After several months of accounting, the accounts for the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth years have been completely cleared. It is heard that the accumulated provincial and local taxes for the three years amount to a total of 192,562 yuan, 1 jiao, and 0.09 li. Now the committee is engaged in clearing the work before the eighteenth year. In addition, the committee's clearing of overdue land tax this time is extremely precise. After many inquiries and verifications, the amount of land in the county is also very clear. It is heard that the total amount of taxed land in the county is 528,830 mu, 5 fen, 9 li, and 6 hao. Except for old wasteland, public occupation, collapsed land, roads, and unclaimed debts, the total amount of ripe land actually collected in the county is 518,412 mu, 8 fen, 3 li, and 9 hao. This time, the committee members calculated the above-mentioned overdue debts based on the actual amount of ripe land collected. However, it is heard that there is no way to check the old wasteland, public occupation, and collapsed land in the archives of the County Finance Bureau.</p>

<p>▲Agreement Reached on Borrowing Education Funds. Because the Provincial Education Funds Management Office owed a large amount of education funds in the 20th year, it telegraphed Zhu Yuankai, the Suzhou Commissioner, to work with the county government to borrow 80,000 yuan from the banking and money industries, using the second installment of the land price tax education surcharge for this year as collateral, to be repaid in four months, with a monthly interest rate of 1.4%. It is heard that an agreement has now been reached after Zhu's handling, and the funds will be turned over in the near future.</p>
<p>▲Digging Up Ancient Tombs. The ancient tomb of a Yuan Dynasty Daoist Wang in Qingzhouguanqian Guangrenli in the city was excavated. The second branch of the Public Security Bureau has detained the foreman Shi Ruchun and transferred the case to the local court for review on the 4th.</p>

<p>▲ Request to Postpone the Implementation of the New Weights and Measures: The County Government previously received an instruction from the Department of Industry, requiring all counties in Jiangsu Province to implement the new weights and measures by the end of this year. Tang Fuqian was appointed as the county's weights and measures inspector and has been actively carrying out various plans since taking office. He stipulated that starting from the first day of this month, the reforms would begin with vegetable market vendors. Prior notice was given to each public security sub-bureau to dispatch police to assist. In the past few days, the results have been excellent, with all vendors having replaced their scales with new ones. However, Mr. Tang believes that other industries also urgently need to be reformed, so it is decided that starting from the 15th, industries such as tea, lacquer, medicine, wax candles, and coal and iron will also be reformed. Yesterday, separate letters were sent to each trade association, forwarding them to member businesses, urging them to promptly order new scales and use them as scheduled. However, the county chamber of commerce believes that in this time of social and economic decline and difficult living conditions, using the new scales, which are only 80% of the commonly used scale codes, is tantamount to raising the prices of all goods in society. Reports from Shanghai and Jiangsu indicate that requests have been made to postpone the implementation. Therefore, a letter has been sent to the county government requesting a postponement to avoid unrest.</p>
<p>▲ Night Boat Robbery: A night boat from this county to Jintong Bridge Town in Jiangyin was carrying more than 30 passengers and goods the other night. As usual, it set off from Wuxi. However, when it entered the Baitang Weikou area, it was already past 10 p.m., and a pirate ship suddenly appeared. Eight or nine bandits jumped out, each wielding weapons. They fired a shot into the air first, yelling for the boat to stop. After boarding the boat, they looted at will for about an hour, taking away silver, goods, and passengers' clothing, worth about five or six hundred yuan. Afterward, the boat owner issued a loss report, reported it to the shipping association, and forwarded it to the county government, requesting the arrest of the thieves.</p>

<p>▲ Departure of the Provincial Land Bureau Survey Team: The internal affairs of the Provincial Land Bureau have now been sorted out, and the county magistrates of Danyang and 19 other counties have been appointed as members of the Land Bureau Preparatory Committee. It is now learned that the bureau has also dispatched the third surveying team to Zhenjiang and the fourth surveying team to Jiangning and Guangde to continue handling the land survey. The third and fourth groups of the map base team have gone to Qingpu and Fengxian to start surveying the county map base points, and they have all departed on time. It is also heard that other teams will be dispatched to Danyang, Yixing, and Liyang counties to begin surveying and measuring, so the bureau's work has been quite tense recently.</p>
<p>▲ Gradual Rise in Silk Prices: The purchase prices of silk in Zhenjiang are several yuan higher than a week ago. Due to the scarcity of supply and excessive demand, silk merchants have no choice but to raise the purchase prices in order to obtain substantial profits when selling. The recent prices are compared with the prices a week ago as follows: Recent prices: First grade: 35 yuan per 100 taels; Second grade: 33 yuan; Third grade: 31 yuan; Fourth grade: 28 yuan. Prices a week ago: First grade: 32 yuan; Second grade: 30 yuan; Third grade: 28 yuan; Fourth grade: 26 yuan.</p>

The driver of the Jiang Yu steamer did not pay attention and suddenly crashed the bow of the ship into the survey ship, sinking quite deeply. Fortunately, it did not leak. The Jiang Yu steamer also suffered minor damage. The captain of the survey ship and the owner of the Jiang Yu steamer both signed an agreement. The Jiang Yu steamer continued to sail as usual, while the survey ship was still moored in the river. It is heard that the machinery has been damaged and cannot move.</p>

<p>▲ Handover Issues of the Water Police District Chief: Jiang Chaoxiong, the chief of the Fourth Water Police District of Jiangsu Province, was dismissed due to a case and detained by the Provincial Public Security Bureau in the provincial capital for unclear handover. The two largest items in the handover were the shortage of firearms and the issuance of police salaries. Jiang said that the firearms were lost when the district headquarters was located in Wusong when the Shanghai Incident suddenly occurred, and it was impossible to retrieve them. Regarding the salary account, a representative, Li Kai, was sent to Nantong on the 3rd to reconcile the accounts with the new district chief, Zhang Xianyi. Zhang Dong, a provincial commissioner, supervised the reconciliation.</p>

It is learned that the Department of Finance, in order to show compassion for the people, has telegraphed the county to postpone the penalties for three months starting in October. In addition, the upper period land tax for the 21st year was originally scheduled to be penalized starting on October 1st, but the Finance Bureau has presented a request to the Department of Finance to postpone it until November 1st. In addition, the official property investigation office has already completed its work, but there is still official property that has not been fully processed, and people's reports of encroachment and occupation are still pouring in. Therefore, a telegram has been sent to the Department of Finance requesting instructions and approval to extend the deadline for one month.</p>

In December of last year, he was suddenly kidnapped by Huzhou bandits. A letter was sent demanding a large ransom. Xu Zimeisheng raised 5,000 yuan and took it to the Jiangsu border to redeem his father. However, Xu Ziquan had already been killed by the bandits. On the night of September 30th of this year, another pirate ship arrived with a dozen bandits, each carrying wooden-cased guns. They landed and suddenly went to Xu's house, kidnapped Xu Meisheng, took him onto the ship, and left.</p>

<p>▲ Appeal Judgment in Sheng Xuanhuai's Daughter's Divorce Case: The sixth daughter of Sheng Xuanhuai (Xingsun) of Wujin, known in Shanghai as Miss Sheng Liu, is 38 years old. In the second year of the Xuantong era of the Qing Dynasty, she was betrothed to Liu Yanting, the son of Liu Tiqing, a wealthy man from Nanxun. They married in the first year of the Republic, and the couple got along quite well. They had two daughters, Zhenbao and Qingbao. In the sixth year of the Republic, Miss Sheng and her husband turned against each other and returned to Ningbo. In the 18th year of the Republic, she filed a lawsuit with the Wuxing branch of the Hangzhou County District Court seeking a divorce from her husband, demanding 350,000 taels of alimony, the return of 94,640 yuan in dowry money, and the repayment of 150,000 taels in alimony loans and 50,000 taels in educational expenses for the two daughters. The branch court ruled on July 25, 20th year of the Republic, granting the divorce and ordering the defendant to repay the plaintiff, Liu Sheng, 52,200 yuan in alimony before the divorce and to refund 10,000 yuan in dowry expenses to Miss Sheng. Subsequently, both parties were dissatisfied and appealed to the High Court in Hangzhou. Each time they submitted a complaint, the stamp duty alone amounted to several thousand yuan. The results of the trial have now been announced. Yesterday, the appeal of both parties was rejected, and the original judgment was upheld. However, it is heard that Liu Yanting had already taken a concubine and had a son in the sixth year of the Republic, and Miss Sheng also has a new love, a Peking opera actor named Zhao Junyu, and a child has recently been born. Therefore, after mediation by others, the plaintiff and defendant have hopes of reaching a settlement.</p>
<p>▲ Rebels on the Zhejiang Border Allowed to Reintegrate: The three counties of Jiangshan, Changshan, and Kaihua on the Zhejiang border are located on the border of Fujian and Jiangxi provinces, and have been repeatedly harassed by Red bandits. Many ordinary people in the counties have inevitably been coerced by the bandits. Recently, due to the large-scale encirclement and suppression, the bandits have been forced to flee into the mountains, and the coerced people dare not return to their homeland and are displaced, which is pitiful. The provincial government believes that these people did not willingly join the bandits and were repeatedly threatened by them, which is understandable. Therefore, a method for allowing them to reintegrate has been drafted, ordering them to surrender to the respective county governments, write a letter of repentance, and have the local village chief and clan leader issue a guarantee, proving that they have genuinely repented. They will then be allowed to reintegrate and will not be prosecuted.</p>

<p>▲ Convening a Bandit Suppression Conference: Zhao Cisheng, the Administrative Inspector Commissioner of the Seventh District of Zhejiang, recently sent his secretary, Mou Xiaotian, to Ningbo to set up an office in the former city government. Commissioner Zhao then departed from Hangzhou and went directly to Sheng County to supervise the suppression of bandits. It is now learned that Commissioner Zhao believes that the bandits in the three counties of Xinchang, Shengxian, and Fenghua have formed mobile bandits. If they are not wiped out as soon as possible, they may become a major problem. Therefore, he convened a bandit suppression conference with the magistrates of six counties, including Xinchang, Shengxian, Fenghua, Yinxian, Yuyao, and Xia, to discuss methods for suppressing the bandits and carrying out rural cleanup. The other night, he sent a special telegram to Secretary Mou Xiaotian in the Ningbo office, informing the magistrate of Yinxian County to go to Sheng County to discuss the matter as soon as possible. The magistrate of Yinxian County, Chen Baolin, obeyed the order and took the early train to Sheng County this morning (the 3rd).</p>

<p>▲ Collection of Defense Corps Surcharges: The funds for the Xiaoxian Defense Corps are now being collected as surcharges on the land tax. The surcharge on each mu of land is two jiao for land tax and security money, totaling more than 5,000 silver dollars. The start-up expenses will be raised temporarily through solicitation.</p>

<p>▲ Establishment of Luqiao Post Office: In recent years, the atmosphere in Luqiao Town, Huangyan, has gradually opened up, and various businesses have been quite developed. However, the post office is still lacking. Now, local citizens have jointly sent a letter to the Zhejiang Provincial Postal Administration requesting the establishment of a post office to benefit the people. It is now learned that the provincial administration has approved the request, selected the Catholic Church as the address, and has officially established it.</p>
<p>▲ Bandits Rob and Kill: The family of Sun Shiyou at the foot of Tongyan Ridge in Dongxiang, Linhai, was suddenly attacked by more than a dozen bandits armed with guns the other night (the 2nd). They broke into the house and robbed, shooting and killing Shiyou's son. The next day, the local judicial branch of this county received the report and immediately sent an official to the scene for inspection.</p>

<p>▲ Provincial Commissioner Wu Shuren Inspects Northern Anhui's Politics: The Anhui Provincial Government, in order to strictly examine the politics of each county, has specially stipulated regulations for provincial government commissioners to inspect the various prefectures and has appointed provincial commissioners to go to each county to conduct on-the-spot inspections. The provincial commissioner responsible for inspecting the politics of the counties in northern Anhui is Wu Shuren. Wu arrived in Bengbu at 3 p.m. on the 2nd from the provincial capital. The Water Police Bureau had received advance notice and sent a team to the station to greet him when the express train arrived. Wu got off the train and went to the Transportation Hotel. He paid courtesy calls to various important agencies that day (the 3rd). He declined all social gatherings. After a short stay in Bengbu, he went to various counties to inspect.</p>
<p>Special Report</p>
<h3 id="e102">A Humble Opinion on Reforming China's School Education <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>(6) Cheng Tianfang</p>
<p>Now, let's give some examples to illustrate. If Province A is building a certain number of miles of highway, and after the highway is completed, a certain number of people will definitely be needed to drive public buses, then the vocational school in Province A should open a bus driver training class to train these bus drivers. It should recruit students who have graduated from elementary school and are above a certain age, and provide them with six months of training so that they can drive buses, repair buses, roughly understand the principles of bus construction, and know various laws regarding highways and driving buses. After six months, they should pass an examination and be issued a license before they can become bus drivers. Wouldn't bus drivers trained in this way be better than bus drivers recruited casually? In this way, on the one hand, the individual's livelihood problem can be solved, and at the same time, because there are good drivers, public safety will be better guaranteed. For example, Province B is a silk-producing area. To develop the silk industry and improve silkworm breeds and silkworm rearing methods, a group of people is needed to do these things. The vocational school in Province B should open a silkworm silk class, recruiting students who have graduated from elementary school and are above a certain age, and provide them with one year or one and a half years of training so that they know how to select silkworm breeds, how to arrange silkworm houses, and how to improve silkworm rearing and silk reeling methods, not only knowing but also practicing. After completing the course, they should pass an examination and be issued a license, or they can go to engage in improving silkworm silk production themselves, or they can be appointed by the government to various counties to guide people in improving the silkworm silk industry. In this way, the individual's livelihood problem can also be solved, and at the same time, social productivity will benefit.</p>
<p>The above are just a few examples. In addition, we can infer that vocational schools must be run in this way to adapt to the needs of society and increase social productivity. The more vocational schools of this kind, the better, because society needs that kind of person, so it opens that kind of class. Once the needs of society have been met, it can stop running that kind of class at any time. Naturally, all students who come out of vocational schools can use what they have learned to support themselves. I advocate that vocational schools should not charge tuition fees and should set up more scholarships or loan amounts to reward students from poor families who work hard to study. Because the students in vocational schools are mostly children from poor families, the country should help them become productive members within the scope of its possibilities.</p>
<p>There are also many occupations that are needed in any province and any place, but vocational schools have never paid attention to them. For example, aren't tailors found in every city? Why shouldn't vocational schools open tailoring classes according to the needs of society? Vocational schools in any province should train a large number of tailors, recruiting students who have graduated from elementary school and are above a certain age and giving them considerable training. Those with clever aptitudes can make very valuable and elaborate clothes, which requires a year and a half or two years to graduate. Those with less clever aptitudes can only make ordinary clothes, which only requires half a year or a year to graduate. After graduation, the school will issue a license, or they can open their own tailoring shop or go to people's homes to work as tailors. Tailors trained in this way will definitely be much better than the many tailors who have not received education. They can not only make clothes, but they can also be called upon to bear the responsibility of promoting domestic goods (because the styles and quality of many ladies' clothes are intentionally or unintentionally influenced by tailors). For example, cooks are also needed in hotels, agencies, schools, and families. Their relationship with a group of society is more important than tailors. However, no one pays attention to such an important occupation, and it is completely undertaken by a group of people who have not received education. In major cities in China, epidemics often occur in the summer and autumn, and many people die. Some of these deaths are definitely due to cooks not understanding hygiene and food not being clean, which leads to the spread of epidemics and the loss of lives. Therefore, vocational schools in any place should open cooking classes, recruiting students who have graduated from elementary school and are above a certain age. In addition to training their cooking skills, they should also have considerable chemical knowledge and hygiene knowledge, how to arrange kitchens, how to select food, how to disinfect food, how to prevent germs, etc. Those with clever aptitudes who want to become cooks in large restaurants and hotels should receive two or three years of training. Those with ordinary aptitudes who can only handle ordinary cooking should only receive one year or one and a half years of training. After graduation, they will be issued a license, and they can run their own restaurants or be employed by others. These cooks who have received considerable education will definitely be much better than cooks who are illiterate. Not only do vocational schools train people needed by society, but the lives of a group of people will definitely be better protected.</p>

<p>▲ Unsatisfactory Reply from the Municipal Government; Establishment of a Strike Committee</p>
<p>Peiping, 4th: More than 400 representatives of primary school teachers in Peiping paraded and petitioned this morning, first going to the Special Commissioner's Office of the Finance Bureau, where Section Chief Rong Kun met with them on behalf of the Special Commissioner, and then going to the Municipal Government. Due to the large number of people, 11 representatives were elected, and Zhou Dawen personally received them. He promised to negotiate with the banking industry again regarding the loan, and there was no problem in reorganizing the business tax. As for future expenses, starting from September, 80% will be paid monthly. The remaining 20% cannot be demanded from the Municipal Government until the central government's funds arrive. Starting from September, 15,000 yuan will be allocated monthly to repay the accumulated debt until it is paid off. After the representatives reported to those outside, they dispersed.</p>
<p>Peiping, 4th: The primary school teachers' petition was unsatisfactory, and a strike committee was immediately formed. Representatives of primary school principals and teachers will go to the capital to demand funds.</p>

<p>▲ Order from the Municipal Education Bureau</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau issued an order yesterday to high schools and above in the city, stating: In accordance with Ministry of Education Order No. 7842, it is approved that the General Inspectorate of Training has consulted and found that military instructors in high schools and above should have their qualifications reviewed by the Ministry, be tested, and be recommended by the Ministry for appointment. This has been done in the past. However, considering the actual situation and to avoid obstacles, in some cases, military instructors hired by the schools themselves have been reported to the Ministry for filing, and this has been temporarily approved. This should be rectified to emphasize the rule of law and benefit military training. The Ministry is now scheduled to conduct the sixth term of recruitment examinations for military instructors. All military instructors hired by the schools themselves, whether they have been reported for filing or are temporarily acting, should be recommended by the original school to the Ministry for registration and examination in accordance with the regulations, and be selected and used after being consulted and dispatched to comply with the regulations and prevent abuses. In addition to publishing the recruitment regulations in the newspaper and notifying them on the notice board of the Ministry, the corresponding recruitment regulations are enclosed, and it is hoped that they will be checked and instructed accordingly. This order (regulations omitted).</p>

<h3 id="e111">Sports Association Warns Spectators at the Stadium <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>▲ Referees Uphold the Judgment</p>
<p>▲ Absolutely Do Not Arbitrarily Scold</p>
<p>The National Sports Association issued an important notice yesterday regarding the spectators at the stadium: The referees for various football matches organized by the association are all members of the Shanghai Chinese Sports Referees Association. Their work is purely voluntary, and they have no affiliation with any of the teams. The goal of each referee is to use their skills to judge impartially. This is the only auxiliary measure to promote sports competitions. However, spectators do not understand this and often yell and scold when they are dissatisfied, or they criticize the referee unfairly without considering their own lack of ability, treating the noble amateur sport as a performance for profit, losing the true pleasure of appreciating the skills of the game. This is an evil phenomenon in the sports field, an obstacle to the progress of sports, and even a reason for foreign countries to despise us. Therefore, we are taking the opportunity to use newspapers to make a stern admonition, hoping that all spectators will respect themselves and encourage each other in order to eliminate these bad habits invisibly. The progress of sports in our country will rely on this.</p>
<p>▲ He Chunhui Understands Righteousness Profoundly: In last week's summer finals, Huadong played against Lingnan. The referee, He Chunhui, is a famous referee in Shanghai. Because he was unreasonably insulted by the spectators at the scene, he was momentarily angry and had the intention of retiring. Later, after the persuasion of the gentlemen of the Referees Association, they asked Mr. He to understand the righteousness profoundly, not to blame the past, and to try his best to serve the association. It is heard that Mr. He will serve as the referee for the match between Donghua and Xibu this Sunday.</p>

However, after a serious illness, he has not fully recovered, leading to him taking second place.

<p>(Do not reprint) Originally written by Zhang Guoxun, Qian Yiqin, and Claire Burcky, jointly translated</p>
<p>Personal contact in basketball games, namely personal fouls, is one of the usual fouls. The right to declare a personal foul lies with the referees and inspectors, and others are not allowed to interfere.</p>
<p>Personal fouls include pulling, tripping, pushing opponents, or rushing up to grab the ball from the opponent's back, or illegal rough behavior that obstructs the opponent even without physical contact is also considered a personal foul.</p>
<p>There are several types of personal fouls that warrant disqualification. If both teams commit fouls against each other, it is a double foul. In some cases, the referee may also impose a penalty of two or more free throws on the fouled team depending on the severity of the foul.</p>
<p>If a foul occurs while the opponent is shooting, there are two possible rulings: (1) If the shot is missed, the fouled player gets two free throws. (2) If the shot goes in, the fouled player gets the points and one free throw. When two opposing players commit fouls against each other, resulting in a double foul, each gets one free throw.</p>
<p>Each personal foul is recorded by the recorder under the name of the player who committed the foul. If a player accumulates four fouls, they lose the right to play for the remainder of that game.</p>

<p>Opinions on the League of Nations Report</p>
<p>▲ Points of Relative Satisfaction and Absolute Disappointment</p>
<p>▲ Efforts by the Government and the People Are Still Required to Recover Lost Territory</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that the summary of the League of Nations Investigative Commission Report was released at 8:00 PM on the 2nd. Member of the Central Committee Sun Zhesheng especially received reporters from various newspapers in this city at his old residence on Molliere Road at 3:30 PM yesterday afternoon to comment on the contents of the report. Mr. Sun expressed disappointment with several points in the report, which are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ Points of Relative Satisfaction Mr. Sun first stated that the investigation of the September 18th Incident was recorded more clearly in the report. For example, (1) in Chapter 4, the investigative commission stated that the Japanese military action on the night of September 18th could not be regarded as a legitimate means of self-defense. (2) After Japan instigated puppet organizations in the Northeast to establish a false regime, it vigorously promoted internationally that the establishment of "Manchukuo" was an independent movement of the people of the three provinces. Chapter 6 of the investigative commission report also condemned "Manchukuo" as being organized under the duress of the Japanese army and could not be recognized as an independent movement established by the people of the area. The above two points of fact were investigated and reported fairly, which is what we consider to be relatively satisfactory.</p>
<p>▲ Points of Absolute Disappointment Chapter 10 of the report puts forward solutions such as (1) a proposal to convene an advisory conference and not advocate the restoration of the situation before the September 18th Incident. This point needs to be studied in detail. Convening the so-called advisory conference and not advocating the restoration of the original state of the three northeastern provinces before the September 18th Incident seems to be based on violence and the established facts. We have serious doubts about not advocating the restoration of the previous state. Does this proposal refer to the state of Chinese rule before September 18th, or the military rule of Zhang Xueliang? If it refers to the former, it contradicts itself. If it refers to the latter, it should be clearly pointed out to avoid misunderstandings by the Japanese. (2) Regarding the extensive autonomy of Manchuria and the organization of an advisory conference, the result will be that the three northeastern provinces will become a nominally existent territory under Chinese control, or China's control over the three northeastern provinces will be nominal. Under the current situation, Japan has great power, and due to its close relationship, Japan will have a majority of seats in the organization of the advisory conference. In the future, the three northeastern provinces will nominally be a part of Chinese territory, but the form of governance will be international co-management, and in fact, it will be Japanese trusteeship. We express absolute disappointment with these two points.</p>
<p>▲ Efforts by Us Are Still Required The report is actually beneficial to Japan, while our country only gets the name. However, the Japanese government and public have unanimously expressed opposition after the report was released, which shows that Japan has long had the determination to annex the three northeastern provinces. Recalling the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, both China and Japan recognized Korea's independence, but in a few years, Japan turned against it and annexed Korea. This is a lesson from the past. Now that Japan's determination to annex the Northeast has been exposed, if we rely solely on the League of Nations, we will only get a disappointing result. At this moment, we can only hope that the government and the people of the whole country are of one mind and one heart to recover the lost land in the Northeast. According to my personal opinion, the League of Nations cannot fundamentally solve the Northeast issue. The solution depends solely on the degree of effort of our government and people, and the attitude of the international community towards the case.</p>
<p>▲ Views on the Boycott Movement A reporter from Xin Sheng She further inquired about the following questions, and the replies were as follows: (1) The report advocates that our country stop the economic severance of relations with Japan. Its nature is a condition for resolving the Northeast issue. In fact, the Japanese invasion of the Northeast is the cause, and the economic severance of relations is the result. If the cause is not eliminated, how can the boycott movement be eradicated? (2) The task of the investigative commission was to determine the responsibility for the Northeast incident, but the report did not dare to point it out clearly. If our country does not settle for the nominal recovery of the Northeast territory, it should prepare to resist aggression with strength, and it is especially necessary to obtain allied countries that have the same interests as ours against Japan in diplomacy.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Reactions of Various Groups to the League of Nations Report <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The Preparatory Committee of the National People's Salvation Groups Federation sent a circular: To all newspapers, organizations, institutions, and compatriots across the country: The League of Nations bears the mission of maintaining international justice and reason in the world. Our government, on September 21st of last year due to the violent September 18th Incident in Shenyang by Japan, requested a protest to the League of Nations Administrative Council in accordance with Article 11 of the League of Nations Covenant. After more than a year, the League of Nations Investigative Commission issued its investigation report. The ten chapters of conclusions clearly support the weak and suppress the strong, especially international cooperation, borrowing crutches on behalf of others, and disregarding our country. The fact of violent Japanese aggression is directly regarded as an inevitable problem, and it is also said that our people's organized economic boycott harms the harmony between countries. The so-called advisory conference, special system, and so on are all whimsical ideas that are far from the sanctity of law and the advocacy of justice, which is completely unexpected. What is the hope of our country from the League of Nations? The prestige of that League of Nations has been swept away not just today. However, before this report was released, the riddle was still there, and we still wanted to solve it ourselves. We did not know that the League of Nations was a group of powerful nations, and the Covenant was a straw dog of the world. If we do not seek our own salvation, who will seek it for us? If we do not save ourselves, who will save us? After a year of giving in with our hands, the result of being swallowed up and eaten is that we have only obtained ten chapters of written waste paper from the investigative commission, which instead raises bad advance tickets for international control of China. If we have any blood, how can we not be saddened? The enemy is deep, what can we do? This association has always had the purpose of vowing to resist to the death without yielding or fearing danger. The more we are frightened by danger, the more difficult it is to remain silent. We pray that all organizations, institutions, and compatriots from all walks of life across the country will wake up together and regard the idea of believing in the League of Nations and relying on international relations as an utterly wrong one. Let us gather all our strength and go to a new target, without hesitating any longer, without enduring any longer, in the hope that the national destiny that is about to die may be saved by chance. The telegram trembles. Please observe. The Preparatory Committee of the National People's Salvation Groups Federation bows, Branch</p>
<p>Fifteen groups, including the China Philanthropic Society, sent a telegram to the National Government yesterday, saying, "To the Nanjing National Government: The League of Nations Investigative Commission report is no different from international co-management. It is better to save ourselves than to seek help from others. It is better to rely on ourselves than to rely on others. We should immediately sever economic relations with Japan and send troops to punish the rebels. Time is pressing, and the public sentiment throughout the country is boiling. The telegram is filled with extreme grief. The China Philanthropic Society, the China Student Salvation Society, the China Women's Rights Movement Alliance, the Shanghai Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Office, the Shanghai Citizen Friendship Association, the China Social Improvement Association, and other fifteen groups bow together, Branch."</p>

<p>▲ Two Lius Actively Prepare for War, Poised on the Brink</p>
<p>The war clouds in Sichuan Province are growing denser daily, and a conflict seems imminent. Both Lius are currently engaged in military deployments, making a large-scale war seemingly unavoidable. The inside story is quite complex. A reporter from the New Sound News Agency inquired with the Sichuan Provincial Government's Shanghai office yesterday, and the following information was deemed reliable: the two Lius are uncle and nephew, with Liu Wenhui being Liu Xiang's uncle. Initially, the relationship between the two was quite harmonious, but recent conflicts over interests have caused frequent clashes. Sichuan Province has over a hundred counties, of which Liu Wenhui's troops control seventy to eighty, more than half the province. Liu Xiang's troops, on the other hand, control only twenty to thirty counties. However, Liu Xiang's counties are all wealthy and prosperous areas, and Chongqing, the most bustling area in Sichuan, is also under Liu Xiang's jurisdiction. Therefore, his twenty to thirty counties are actually superior to Liu Wenhui's seventy to eighty counties. In the past, goods shipped to Sichuan from other provinces had to pass through the Chongqing port, where taxes were very low. Liu Wenhui had long wanted a share of the profits but had been unable to do so. Recently, Liu Wenhui ordered a large quantity of firearms and ammunition from abroad, worth over three million, and when they were transported to Sichuan, they were all detained by Liu Xiang when passing through Chongqing. Liu Wenhui was furious upon hearing this and immediately negotiated with Liu Xiang, demanding their return and passage. Liu Xiang refused. Liu Wenhui then asked for half to be returned, but this was also rejected. Thus, a grudge was formed. Although the two Lius have publicly stated that they will not engage in civil war, they are still actively engaged in military deployments. The Shanghai Peace Association sent a telegram to Sichuan urging them to cease hostilities, but received only one reply. Currently, Huang Jinghan, the political advisor of the 20th and 24th Armies of Sichuan Province, has come to Shanghai to request the Peace Association to make further effective appeals. Huang, being positioned between the two Lius, has come to Shanghai to ask for mediation from all sectors of society.</p>

According to an investigation by a New Sound News Agency reporter stationed in Beijing, the specific plan for submitting the points for amendment is currently being worked on by Yang Zhaolong, the section chief of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, who is considering and combining the opinions listed in the original proposals of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Justice to form a complete and specific plan. It has been decided to hold a second meeting of commissioners this week to discuss and supplement the opinions of this specific plan and to decide on the procedures for submitting the request for amendment to the various countries. The date for issuing the note will also be decided at this meeting, and it is expected to be issued around the end of this month.</p>

<h3 id="e137">Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Notifies All Industries to Adopt Domestic Coal <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>▲ The Harm of Foreign Coal Dumping Endangers the National Economy and the People's Livelihood</p>
<p>▲ Foreign Coal May Not Be Sold Cheaply When Domestic Coal Production Stops</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce issued a notice to all industries: "We hereby inform you that on the 4th of this month, we received an order from the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, She Zi No. 4253, to comply with the order. The order from the Ministry of Industry, Kuang Zi No. 4335, stated that according to the National Coal Relief Committee, the dumping of foreign coal in various ports along the Yangtze River has caused the sales of domestic coal to plummet. It has been requested that the Ministry provide relief. Zhu Yonghe, the manager of the Datong Coal Mine Company, suggested that since the signing of the Shanghai Armistice and the restoration of peace, Japanese coal has been imported in large quantities, with prices lowered to occupy the market. As a result, the sales of domestic coal have been greatly hindered. Although Shanghai has suffered less damage, sales in various ports along the Yangtze River have been greatly affected. Recently, the Hankou Water and Electricity Company is still selling coal made in Fushun, for the reason that the burning power of Fushun coal is strong. Although domestic coal has different grades, the high grade actually exceeds Fushun in power, which can be verified and is not an opinion. Many power plants in various places use domestic coal and have not heard of any cases where boilers could not be ignited. It is simply that Japanese coal is cheaper and therefore used. Factories along the Yangtze River often have this situation, which has led to the expansion of Japanese coal sales. If we do not take measures to remedy the situation, we will not be able to promote domestic goods and prevent leakage. It is requested that the chamber submit a report to the Ministry of Industry, ordering the general chambers of commerce in Jiangsu, Anhui, Hubei, Jiangxi, and other provinces to instruct local manufacturers to adopt domestic coal uniformly in order to clear sales channels and recover profits, resist dumping, and protect domestic products. There is no better way to do this. It was specially proposed for discussion to ask whether it is feasible and was temporarily proposed by our committee member Xie Chuang to ask the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to persuade merchants to sell and use domestic coal. A tea party was convened with various committee members to discuss this proposal. According to the investigation, the coal mines operated by foreign capital in China have all dumped by lowering prices and extending credit in order to cut off the livelihood of domestic coal and enable various sales agents to make large profits, thereby monopolizing. However, among users and coal merchants, there are many who are patriotic and do not buy foreign coal or sell foreign coal, but there are also not a few who forget righteousness for profit. Measures should be taken to stop this. According to Manager Zhu's suggestion and Committee Member Xie's proposal, they are all correct. However, to persuade factories and shipping companies to use complete domestic coal, the local chambers of commerce should publish announcements in newspapers to promote it to all sectors of society. A joint meeting of local factories and coal merchants should be convened to inform them of the harm of foreign coal dumping, which not only endangers domestic coal but also affects the national economy and the people's livelihood. If we are selfish and short-sighted, it is like drinking poison to quench thirst. When domestic coal production stops, foreign coal may not be sold cheaply, and may even raise prices and hoard. If we want to use domestic coal to recover profits and plug leaks, it will be impossible. At that time, the pain and insults will be too late. It is better to insist early, promote domestic products with group efforts, and save the situation from now on. This is the key. It is also proposed to appeal to the government to ensure that the tax rules for domestic coal mines are equal to those of foreign capital operating coal mines in China, so as to reduce the cost of domestic coal and increase production, which will provide relief. It is necessary to request the Ministry to order all chambers of commerce to implement it effectively, and also to consult the Ministry of Finance on the equality of tax rates for Chinese and foreign mine owners. The reasons are that a written report is prepared and submitted, requesting approval and implementation. In addition to consulting the Ministry of Finance on the tax rate issue, the ministry ordered the bureau to instruct the major factories and chambers of commerce to comply accordingly. This order, etc. was received and recorded and notified to you, hoping that you will check and inform your affiliates to comply accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Exhibition Notes of the China Cotton Clothing Association <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Cheng Qing, the initiator of the China Cotton Clothing Association, held an exhibition of domestic cloth at the Qingliang Temple on Xinzha Road on October 2-3. The previous report stated that on that day, a horizontal banner was hung in the center of the venue, reading "Clothing of Great Cloth," and on both sides were couplets reading "Clothing covers the world, Weaving is a concern." The characters were large, about a foot in diameter, and were made of blue characters embroidered on white cloth. In the middle was a paper with the history of domestic cloth and suggestions for improvement. More than 800 kinds of domestic cloth were displayed in the venue. During the two days, about 3,000 people visited, and the words of those from the National Goods Company and various textile factories were the most practical and useful. Generally, rural women cannot replace their looms due to accumulated habits, so the width of the cloth is too narrow, and the yarn spun by hand is coarse, thick, and uneven. To fundamentally improve, someone must set up a factory, change to looms and factory yarn, and gather female workers, turning scattered pieces into whole units. It is best to have someone with great power lead them in an orderly and unified manner. Otherwise, looms and factory yarn must be purchased on their behalf to make the cloth. It is not easy to get them to buy it on their own. The dyeing and patterns also cannot be guided by someone without knowledge. At that time, someone gathered to discuss setting up a local cloth factory, but it is not known whether it will become a reality. Among the various cloths displayed, there were many suitable for making Western suits, as well as many items for women and children. During the two days, a total of three to four hundred bolts were sold at retail and wholesale, and more than 1,000 bolts were ordered, mostly woven cloth, which can be used to make Western suits and is especially suitable for women and children. It was unexpected that so much was sold, which also shows that the purchasing power of those who love to use domestic goods is not weak. Zhang Ji, the director of the Agricultural Education Hall, and Zhang Jinkang were responsible for collecting this cloth and explaining the improvement suggestions at the venue, which was quite painstaking. Cheng Bojia said during the two days that we are exhibiting domestic cloth, not holding a meeting, nor have we asked anyone to give a speech. I have not been on a speech stage for twenty years. I used to make a living on the speech stage in Shanxi and Zhejiang for two or three days. We want to do practical things. Meetings and speeches are frequent, but as a result, no good things are done, and people have excuses. Foreigners say that the French do things and then talk about them, the Germans talk about them and then do them, and the British do things and don't talk about them. We Chinese can be said to talk about them and not do them. I hope that all members will not use the badge of the China Cotton Clothing Association as an ornament. People say that this badge is very generous and looks good. I hope that the Cotton Clothing Association will do very generous and good-looking things as a memorial to China when it is about to be destroyed. China may not be able to avoid being destroyed. The national situation is like the six dice falling backwards, and the rivers and the sun are going down. There are too many shameless people who see profits. The poem says, "Rats have teeth, but people have no shame. If people have no shame, why wait for death?" They are really shameless things. You have also seen the foreign cloth shops on the recent roads, where people are rushing to buy foreign cloth at discounts of 40% to 50%. Goods are sold quickly, and goods are imported even faster. This is called dumping, so that everyone buys enough cheap goods, and there is no need for domestic goods. Foreigners use the psychology of people who see profits and forget righteousness to destroy the country of people who see profits and forget righteousness. It is also because we lack substitutes for foreign goods that we have to buy them. The spread of success is not strong, and no one knows that there are not a few things that can replace foreign goods, so gathering exhibitions, improving local goods, and imitating foreign goods are important things. The first exhibition is local cloth, and the second exhibition is the cloth woven by Chinese machine factories, which is similar to foreign goods and can be a substitute. However, the exhibition period has not yet been determined within the day. Although several factory comrades agree with my saying that dozens of products should be gathered for exhibition, it is not yet known whether it can become a reality, because I have no power, and I have no appeal. I wanted to invite a few people to the meeting to assist, but they did not come. Jesus said that rich people cannot enter heaven, and I don't expect them either. On that day, many people said that it is best to ask a prominent person to set an example and naturally follow the trend. Why not measure the length and width of his body, make a piece of clothing of great cloth, and ask him to wear it. Cheng said that if schools do not read the Book of Rites, people do not know the term Book of Rites or the story of Wei Wengong's clothing of great cloth. As for the prominent person, I don't know him, and I can't get close to him, let alone measure his length and width. Besides, this garment is not the yellow robe of Zhao Kuangyin's Chenqiao mutiny. Would it be put on someone's body and not taken off? Those who heard it laughed. On that day, several very short people in the venue visited the various cloths for a week and left in a hurry.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Taikoo Company's Zhoushan Steamer Sinks into the Sea <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Taikoo Company's An Dong-class steamer, Zhoushan, struck a reef off Yantai Island on the 1st of this month, causing a breach in the bow, and the passengers were rescued. This has been reported in this newspaper. Taikoo Company is now entrusting a Japanese salvage company in Dalian to try to tow it. The Japanese rescue ship arrived in Yantai on the afternoon of the 3rd. However, because a large storm had occurred on the sea, the salvage work could not be carried out. Only a small portion of the cargo in the ship was salvaged, and the rest was still in the ship. Yesterday, the storm on the sea was even greater, the bow of the Zhoushan steamer had already broken, and the middle cabin and other places were also damaged. The hull of the ship could not support the impact of the huge waves. Yesterday, the Shanghai office received an urgent telegram from Yantai stating that the Zhoushan steamer could not be salvaged due to the deteriorating weather, and had already sunk into the sea yesterday. Most of the cargo and the crew's luggage had not been taken out, so the losses were huge. The 99 passengers who were rescued are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the company's Shuntian steamer at around 3 PM today.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Glimpses of the China Merchants Bureau's Reorganization <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>▲ Expanding Shipping Routes and Renovating Warehouses</p>
<p>▲ Inspecting Ships and Evaluating Crew Members</p>
<p>Since Li Guojie took over as the General Manager of the China Merchants Bureau, he has formulated a reorganization plan and implementation steps, which were submitted to the Supervisory Office and approved by the Ministry of Transportation. The plan is being actively implemented, and considerable progress has been made. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Warehouse Operations. Most of the bureau's Yangtze and coastal vessels have been dilapidated. Coal has been purchased from Japan in the past. Since the Northeast Incident last year, domestic coal has been used instead, mostly from Zhongxing, Jingxing, Boshan, and the Chinese-British joint venture Kailuan. They are all purchased in bulk by the original ship, and the coal merchants supply them in installments according to the contract. The type and composition of the coal are based on a chemical test. To prevent the mixing of inferior coal, each coal ship is carefully inspected upon arrival. Most of the docks and wharves are damaged and in need of repair. The roofs of Warehouses 1 and 2 in the central warehouse have been renovated, and the doors and windows have been repaired, which were completed last month at a cost of more than 8,000 taels of silver. The repair of the bamboo fence in the Chinese warehouse cost 1,000 taels of silver. In addition, the warehouses, quays, and plum blossom piles of the North, Central, Xinhua, and Four Warehouses have been reported for bidding and will be repaired immediately. As for attracting business to the warehouses, from April to August of this year, the average monthly business was over 90,000 taels. Compared with the highest average monthly business of 80,000 taels four years ago and the lowest average monthly business of 56,000 taels, the business in May this year reached more than 130,000 taels.</p>
<p>▲ Expanding Shipping Operations. This year's business has been affected by (1) the decline in production due to the Yangtze River floods last year, (2) the lack of vitality after the Shanghai War, and the continued depression of people's livelihood, and (3) the requisition of ships, which prevented them from carrying as much cargo as possible. Now, the ships that were requisitioned are being gradually returned. The Yangtze River area is gradually improving. Although the Dalian and Yingkou ports on the North Sea route have been affected by the current situation, the Yantai and Tianjin ports are operating as usual. The South China route is very popular for passengers and cargo, and preparations are being made to add ships. The Xiang River shipping industry has made considerable progress. Jiangda and Kuaili have been temporarily assigned to the Xiang-Han route. Wooden sheds have been added to the Jinliyuan Wharf, street lights have been added, 14 cargo inspectors and 4 Russian police officers have been hired to maintain the order of the docks. Preparations are being made to establish an office in Qingdao. After the opening of the customs route, ships will be sent. A branch office will be re-established in Fuzhou, and Taishun will be designated as a Shanghai-Fujian liner to recover the lost business.</p>
<p>▲ Reorganizing Ships. All ships that arrive in Shanghai and request repairs must first be inspected for their engineering. Important projects must be surveyed and estimated first, and an estimate form must be prepared. The factories submit bids to undertake the project, aiming for low prices and solid workmanship. The electrical equipment of each ship is inspected, the cargo hold volume of each ship is measured, and the heating surface area of the boiler of each ship is measured for auditing purposes. As for the regulations on the service of crew members and the regulations on repairing ships, they are being planned. Senior crew members are also being assessed for promotion, and the resumes of junior crew members are being registered to facilitate promotion. The diligence of those on duty is inspected to serve as a standard for attendance. The procedures for applying for coal are streamlined, and the reasons for application are thoroughly reviewed.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Silk Factory Labor Strike Yesterday <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>▲ Two Factories Resumed Work Yesterday</p>
<p>After the female workers of various silk factories in the concession area went on strike again the day before yesterday, two factories, Yuyuan and Chuxin, resumed work yesterday. The silk factories in the Hongkou area remained closed. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Two Factories Resumed Work. Since the female workers of various factories in the Three Districts (concession area) went on strike again on the afternoon of the day before yesterday (the 4th), the labor and management sides have not negotiated. Yesterday morning, the factories still blew their whistles as usual, urging the female workers to go to work. At the same time, the police sent a large number of detectives to protect the factories. As a result, 70% of the female workers from the Yuyuan and Chuxin silk factories on Guoqing Road in the Chinese area went to work, and the police station sent police to maintain order. The female workers from the five factories of Xiangfeng, Jingwei, Xiangyuan, and Chang on Gansu Road and Alaersituo Road did not go to work, so the factories immediately stopped the silk machines.</p>
<p>▲ Hongkou Situation. The silk factories in the Hongkou area remained closed yesterday, and work remained suspended. Most of the striking female workers were waiting quietly at home, so there were no disputes. The labor union investigated the recent silk prices and prepared a table, which was sent to the Social Affairs Bureau for verification.</p>
<p>▲ Yichang Moves to Wuxi. The Yichang Silk Factory has ceased production.</p>
<p>After settling the workers' wages the day before yesterday, the arrears of wages before September were paid out at 1 PM yesterday. The female workers in each department of the factory also went to the factory on time to collect their wages. It is reported that the factory has now rented the Tai factory outside Wuxi's two gates to continue operating. The factory's employees will be taken to the new factory in Wuxi. Yesterday, a group of employees left Shanghai. However, a group of employees were introduced by the landlord and are planned to be dismissed immediately. The employees have requested that severance pay for two months be issued and have requested the union to negotiate with the factory.</p>
<p>▲ Union Reports. The Silk Industry Union of the Third District reported to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday: "Regarding the renewed strike of the workers of Xiangfeng Silk Factory, etc., we request that the matter be investigated and handled. The female workers of various silk factories in our district went on strike automatically because they could not bear the exploitation of the factory. Later, after the union sent personnel to persuade them, they resumed work on the 26th of last month, waiting quietly for a solution. However, the workers of Xiangfeng Silk Factory, etc., have waited for many days and have not seen a solution. They suddenly went on strike again yesterday afternoon. The union has no way to deal with it. We hereby send this letter to report and request that you quickly approve it. It is truly in the public interest.</p>
<p>▲ Municipal Government Instructions. The Municipal Government is paying close attention to the silk factory strike. Fearing that the dispute would be prolonged and affect local security, after receiving the report from the Social Affairs Bureau, the government specially instructed the Social Affairs Bureau to quickly resolve the issue.</p>
<p>▲ Negotiation Method. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, the Municipal Party Department, and the Municipal Public Security Bureau negotiated to resolve the silk factory strike dispute. At 2 PM yesterday, representatives of the Silk Factory Trade Association, Shen Huachen and Zhang Peishen, were summoned for talks. The head of the mediation section, Wang Xianqing, received them. According to the demands made by the union, the capitalists were persuaded, and the following was decided: (1) The workers should resume work first, and the labor and management sides should jointly be responsible for persuading the workers. (2) The government will be responsible for investigating and dealing with those who cause trouble.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Labor Strike in the Letterpress Printing Industry Due to Employer's Breach of Contract <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>▲ Union Letter to Association Sets Deadline for Reply</p>
<p>All workers in the Shanghai letterpress printing industry went on strike last year due to the issue of working hours. Fortunately, it was resolved through government mediation. Now, due to the impact of the war, the employers are refusing to comply with the labor-management conditions, and the workers are angry. The Letterpress Printing Industry Union reported the situation and argued according to reason. Yesterday, in addition to sending a letter to the employers' trade association, the union also reported to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Party Department, ordering the employers to earnestly fulfill their obligations. The original text is as follows: "Regarding the letterpress printing industry's employers failing to fulfill the conditions, privately making agreements and ordering workers to obey, oppressing workers, destroying the labor movement, and dismissing workers in large numbers, we request that you severely stop this and implement the terms. The Zhonghe Printing House forced workers to change to contract work and ordered workers to pay rent. The Meili Printing House discounted wages, paying only 70%, and dismissed 23 workers in batches, privately formulating regulations to force them to obey and instructing workers to leave the union. Other factories, such as Shengsheng Printing House, have also dismissed workers in large numbers and forced the contract work system. The future of the labor movement has been destroyed, and the workers' livelihoods have been cut off. The union, in consideration of the imminent destruction of the country and the disturbance of the Red bandits, has decided not to provoke incidents. At a time when the Chinese people are uniting to resist foreign insults, the employers are disregarding humanity and public opinion, oppressing workers and destroying the labor movement, which is unfortunate. In addition to sending a separate letter to the employers' trade association to earnestly fulfill their obligations and setting a deadline for a reply, we hereby report the situation of oppression to your Ministry Bureau Association, and respectfully request that you approve and order the employers to earnestly comply in order to avoid disputes, relieve the workers' difficulties, and facilitate the progress of the industry. It is truly in the public interest." Respectfully submitted to the Municipal Party Department, Social Affairs Bureau, and General Labor Union.</p>

<p>▲Negotiation by the Municipal Government Based on the Situation</p>
<p>The Jiang Yu Ji Construction Factory on Route Tenant de la Tour in the French Concession of this city was subjected to ultra vires taxation and unreasonable interference by the French Municipal Council. They retained lawyer Jiang Zongpan and requested assistance from the Chinese Taxpayers Association of the Public Concession. The association considered this matter related to national sovereignty and sent a letter to the municipal government to lodge a protest. The municipal government yesterday lodged a strong protest with French Consul General Meyrier. The original letter is transcribed below:</p>
<p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>
<p>According to a letter from the Chinese Taxpayers Association of the Shanghai Public Concession, based on a letter from lawyer Jiang Zongpan, Jiang Changlin of the Jiang Yu Ji Construction Factory stated that in the area of Route Tenant de la Tour No. 222 in the French Concession in 1920, he leased a piece of land, identified as a "fangdan" (property deed registered with the Chinese authorities) property, from Chen Genfa and others, measuring three mu, on which several bungalows were built for temporary use as storage and a workshop. For many years, everything was peaceful. Unexpectedly, in August of this year, the French Municipal Council suddenly ordered the payment of 358 taels and 9 mace of land tax, arguing that the land was "fangdan" property and had no obligation to pay the tax. After a reasoned reply, on the morning of September 20th, the Council sent people to forcibly seal off the entire frontage of the property with lead wire, preventing entry and exit, and detaining workers inside, disregarding the freedom of residence acquired by the people under the law.</p>
<p>It is noted that the nature of a concession and a leased territory is absolutely different. The establishment of a concession only designates an area in which foreigners are allowed to lease land to establish residences. Therefore, except for land leased through deeds with foreign nationals in the concession and its road areas, "fangdan" properties are, according to law and custom, exempt from land tax. The reason is that "fangdan" properties are owned by Chinese and still pay national tax and surcharges, and are not leased to foreigners. Therefore, the Council has no right to collect land tax. Even if payment is required, it should be collected directly from the landowners, not from the tenants. Now, the Council is violating the agreement, breaking customs, illegally levying taxes, and without going through legal procedures or filing a lawsuit in court, it is using coercive means to seal off the warehouse, in effect forcing people to do what they are not obligated to do. This is a small matter of infringing on individual legal rights, but a major matter of undermining the agreement and harming our national sovereignty. Moreover, the lives of more than a dozen workers detained inside are at risk, which is absolutely inhumane.</p>
<p>It is noted that the Public Works Department of the Public Concession previously attempted to collect land tax, but after legal contention by the Chinese Taxpayers Association, it was immediately canceled. The present case is the same and must be fought for to safeguard sovereignty. It is requested that the situation be communicated to the Shanghai Public Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association for assistance.</p>
<p>The situation is as stated above. It is requested that you investigate and handle the matter. According to the documents, the "fangdan" land in the concession area, according to the words and spirit of international conventions, based on legal principles, the municipal authorities of the concession have absolutely no right to collect land tax. The Public Concession has had similar incidents, which were exempted after the association fought for them according to law. The Public Concession authorities are particularly able to be convinced by law in this case, which is admirable. Moreover, the French Concession authorities, in addition to the blockade, detained workers, which is even more unacceptable to humanity. According to the above, it is requested that your government promptly negotiate to protect sovereignty, which is a matter of public concern.</p>
<p>According to this, it is requested that the situation be investigated and clarified, and that the actions be promptly rescinded. This is addressed to Mr. Meyrier, French Consul General in Shanghai.</p>

<p>▲The Leprosy Conference Opens Today</p>
<p>▲More Than Fifty Representatives Have Registered</p>
<p>The National Leprosy Conference, organized by the China Leprosy Relief Association for several months, opened as scheduled at 10:00 AM today at No. 1320 Avenue Haig. Chinese and foreign guests arrived in large numbers. Those from remote inland areas, such as Lin Zhanmei, director of the Daqin Island Leprosarium in Guangdong, Mr. Huasheng from Yunnan, and Deng Shukun from Nanchang, Jiangxi, also came from thousands of miles away to participate in the grand event. Foreign representatives included Mr. Oudman, Secretary General of the British Leprosy Relief Association, and Mr. Conk, representative of the Canadian Leprosy Relief Association, who made a special trip to attend the conference, which is particularly commendable. According to news from the preparatory office of the conference last night, as of last night (the 4th), more than fifty Chinese and foreign expert representatives had registered. The number of those who register later and join temporarily will not be small. It is expected that at least eighty people will attend the opening of the conference. Mayor Wu, the honorary chairman of the conference, is scheduled to welcome all the representatives at the Shanghai Western Suburbs Club this afternoon.</p>

<p>▲The Taxpayers Association Sends a Letter to the Public Works Department Requesting the Return of Overcharged Water Fees</p>
<p>▲Fen'anfang Exempted from Water Fees According to Municipal Donation Regulations</p>
<p>▲Why Use Water Shutoff to Coerce Extra Charges?</p>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers Association of the Public Concession, according to a letter from its member Fenxing Company, stated that it recently received a letter from the British-owned Water Company stating that the water fees for Fen'anfang on East Seward Road in the Eastern District would only be waived for one and a half months, otherwise the water would be shut off. It is noted that after the ceasefire agreement in the Eastern District, the landlords in the area were exempted from rent for two months based on the municipal general donation. Since the rent for two months has not been received by several companies, how can they compensate the water company's water fees? The company is registered in the UK, and people all over the world know that the UK is the most civilized country. Why does the company resort to shutting off water as a threat? It is hoped that your association will provide reasonable assistance. The situation is eagerly awaited.</p>
<p>It is noted that if the landlord is exempted from rent for two months following the municipal general donation exemption method, then the water fees cannot be collected. A letter is sent to your association requesting negotiations. This has been approved. If the war-time water fees are handled in accordance with the municipal general donation exemption method, it would be the simplest method, but due to the separate handling, there are many disputes. The landlord has already been exempted from rent for two months following the donation exemption method, and the losses are considerable. Even if there is some water usage, the water company can only bear the losses during this irresistible war. Although an investigation shows that Fenxing Company has been forced to pay the half-month water fee under the threat of water shutoff by the water company, it should be returned under the principles of justice and fairness.</p>
<p>According to the foregoing, it is requested that your bureau instruct the water company to handle the matter. This is addressed to the General Manager of the Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Department.</p>

<p>▲More Than 600 Fire Insurance Policyholders Claim Compensation from Various Insurance Companies Yesterday</p>
<p>▲Continuing This Morning</p>
<p>The Shanghai Disaster Area Fire Insurance Claim Group gathered about 600 policyholders at the Tianhou Temple at 8:00 AM yesterday (the 4th). They formed a team and set off in different directions. Hu Yibo, Wang Zhixiang, Li Heng, and more than a dozen others were elected as leaders to demand compensation from insurance companies such as Taiping, Queen, Zen Chen, and Huaxing. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Mr. Xue, the manager of Taiping, told the policyholder representatives that he acknowledged that compensation should be handled in accordance with the "mass compensation method."</p>
<p>(2) Xu Hongqing, the manager of Queen, replied to the compensation issue, stating that he was bound by the Insurance Industry Association and could not make claims independently.</p>
<p>(3) Because there was no one in charge of the Huaxing Insurance Company, no talks were held.</p>
<p>(4) Zen Chen had the most policyholders. The foreign manager of the company, Mr. Baker, replied that the company had telegraphed its head office to request instructions on how to handle the compensation for each policyholder. Once a reply was received, the method would be announced to the public. It seemed that he could accept the intention. However, due to the large number of policyholders, the police were concerned about potential complications and sent Chinese and Western detectives and patrol cars to maintain traffic order in the Jiangxi Road area, and no disputes occurred.</p>
<p>At around 2:00 PM, the policyholders sent fifty representatives to the Municipal Party Headquarters to petition. The director of the Civil Training Section met them and expressed his full support. The representatives were satisfied and left.</p>
<p>It is reported that this morning, the policyholders continued to seek compensation from Chinese and foreign insurance companies and vowed not to stop until their goals were achieved.</p>
<p>Also, it is reported that Wang Xiaoji, chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, specifically contacted Mayor Wu yesterday to discuss the fire insurance compensation issue. After discussions, Mayor Wu expressed great sympathy for the disaster victims and stated that the government could not but find ways to relieve the disaster-stricken people. The municipal government would negotiate with the insurance industry to find a concrete solution to the disaster area insurance compensation issue. Mr. Wang immediately conveyed this to the members of the Fire Insurance Compensation Coordination Association and notified all policyholders.</p>

<p>The Fifth Day of the Chinese Medical Association Conference</p>
<p>The Chinese Medical Association continued its business meeting yesterday morning. At 10:35 AM, Mr. Okey, a London statistics expert, gave a presentation on the importance of statistics in medicine, stating that the use of medical science, regardless of basic or clinical materials, is limited if statistical methods are not used for precise analysis. Members attending the meeting then participated in discussions, and the results were summarized as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Statistics is not valued because its format is boring and tasteless.</p>
<p>(2) Most hospital physicians in various places have heavy duties, and it is difficult to supply systematic materials.</p>
<p>(3) Disease terminology is diverse and complex, making it difficult for statisticians to start.</p>
<p>In order to correct the above shortcomings, physicians in various places should use a uniform format to record daily clinical materials precisely, compile them, and submit them to statistical experts. Mr. Okey will make an overall analysis, compile them and send them to the members, and disclose them in the Chinese Medical Journal.</p>
<p>The discussion ended at 12:30 PM. After lunch, group meetings were held for five groups: obstetrics and gynecology, dermatology, radiology, pathology, and physiology.</p>
<p>At 4:00 PM in the afternoon, members went to Renji Hospital on Shandong Road for tea, and others visited the Public Works Department's Health Department. Renji Hospital also performed internal medicine and surgery demonstrations in the research room on the fifth floor.</p>
<p>At 9:00 PM in the evening, there was a tea party at the private residence of Sir Candali at No. 6 West Great Road. Male and female guests were at the peak of fashion, with melodious music, fragrant clothes and beautiful hairpins, and everyone dispersed in joy.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Cholera Epidemic Period Has Passed</p>
<p>The Director of the Public Works Department's Health Department reported to the Board of Directors that the cholera cases in the Public Concession and surrounding areas have now moved away from being epidemic.</p>
<p>It is noted that around May 30 of this year, the cholera cases in Shanghai reached an epidemic level, and on June 6, the Public Concession and the roads outside the boundary also reached an epidemic level. According to the standards for calculating whether an infectious disease has reached an epidemic level, if an average of three patients are reported each day within a week, the area is considered epidemic. According to statistics for the past week, there were a total of three cases of cholera in the Public Concession, with no deaths.</p>

<p>Readjusting Water Prices in Zhabei</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company's previous cancellation of bundled water and widespread installation of water meters caused disputes among landlords, companies, and users. The municipal government stipulated four compromise measures in August 1929. The implementation period was originally until the end of 1931. As the expiration date was approaching, the company believed that most of the existing bundled water users were poor, and the cost of installing water meters would be higher than bundled water. Fearing that landlords would use this reason to raise rents to tenants, for the benefit of the poor, the company's board of directors resolved to stipulate four special price measures and reported them to the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau for review and transfer to the municipal government. Later, the war broke out and the matter was suspended. It is now reported that the measures have been approved by the municipal government and will be implemented. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) For existing bundled water users whose rent is below 12 yuan, the water price can be calculated at a special price when water meters are installed.</p>
<p>(2) The implementation period of the above-mentioned special price is set at two years, ending on December 31, 1933.</p>
<p>(3) The special price, regardless of the amount of water used, is set at 1.5 jiao (cents) per 1,000 gallons, or 7 fen (cents) per cubic meter.</p>
<p>(4) If the landlord holds shares in the company, the water fee can still be calculated at 90% of the special price according to the shareholder's water usage preferential method.</p>

<p>Various Organizations in Hongkou Send a Letter to the Taxpayers Association Requesting Negotiation on the Extortion Donation Case</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, the joint office of the Shanghai Citizens' Federation, the Hongkou District Sub-Branch, and the Joint Federation of Business Circles on Yinxinggang, East Seward Road, Hansbury Road, Broadway Road, Haining Road, Avenue Road, Suzhou Road, Jiaxing Road, and other roads, sent a letter to the Chinese Taxpayers Association of the Public Concession, stating:</p>
<p>Yinxinggang is an area beyond the boundary of the Public Works Department. The streets are built by the merchants themselves. The Public Works Department only assigns house numbers and sends a few police officers to patrol. During the Shanghai war, the Public Works Department abandoned the area, allowing it to be arbitrarily ravaged by the Japanese army. After the disaster, instead of providing relief, they wanted to implement an additional sanitation donation. The merchants were in pain and unable to bear the burden. They requested exemption or gradual implementation. While negotiations were underway, the first batch of several shops were prosecuted and fined. Unexpectedly, the second batch came suddenly. Without urging the six shops, namely Yuanda Tailji Yueji Yang Xinmao Lu Yixing Zhu Lanting, etc., they used their old trick and secretly sued them in court, resulting in a fine of as much as three yuan per shop and the payment of donations, causing the small merchants to suffer heavy burdens. This is an injustice. Such unreasonable and oppressive means by the Public Works Department are a public grievance for citizens. If this behavior is not stopped, the despotism will become even worse in the future. It is requested that your association, as the leader of taxpayers, promptly make a fair claim, demanding that the Public Works Department be liable for compensation for the damages and ensure that oppressive acts that violate public reason will not occur again in order to appease public grievances and stabilize commerce.</p>

<p>Fisheries Organizations Representatives Conference</p>
<p>▲Resolved to Oppose Government's Collection of Fisheries Tax</p>
<p>▲Yu Qiaqing Telegraphed Request to Cancel the Proposal</p>
<p>Upon hearing that the government intends to implement a fisheries tax, the fishery organizations in this city convened a representatives conference of fishery merchants yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM at the Ningbo Guild Hall. Representatives including Yu Houtai of the Seafood Fishery Association, Wu Tingsheng of the Salted Fish Association, Ge Liquan of the Taizhou Fishery Merchants, Bao Bingheng of the Maofeng Fishery Company, Mao Jusheng of the China Fishery Company, Zhai Jiujun of the Fresh Fish Guild, Yu Zhenqing of the Shanghai Fishery Association, and Dai Taohang of the Fishery Merchants Customs Brokerage, totaling more than 60 people, attended the conference. Yu Houtai was elected chairman. After reporting on the government's intention to implement the fisheries tax, the following resolutions were passed:</p>
<p>(1) Organize a Fishery Tax Exemption Maintenance Committee. Each organization will send one to five representatives to participate in the organization. Organizations that have not yet attended the conference are requested to participate successively.</p>
<p>(2) The internal expenses of the committee will be borne by two types of sponsorships: Type A, 800 yuan; Type B, 500 yuan.</p>
<p>At the same time, Yu Qiaqing, a leader in the fishery industry, telegraphed the government requesting the cancellation of the fisheries tax. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Nanjing, respectfully presented to Chairman Lin of the National Government, Premier Wang of the Executive Yuan, and Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry: Upon hearing the news of the revival of the fisheries tax, fishery merchants and fishermen are running around in distress and telling each other. It is noted that the exemption of the fisheries tax was implemented by order on March 28, 1921. A sudden reversal seems inappropriate to show good faith to the people. Currently, taxing material objects is purely a transit tax. It is not appropriate to reopen this evil precedent after the abolition of likin (internal transit tax). In recent years, the fishery industry has declined and is on the verge of collapse. Millions of fishermen are on the brink of bankruptcy. Protection is not even possible, let alone exploitation. What is felt to be dangerous must be reported. It is earnestly requested that a decisive decision be made to immediately cancel the original proposal. It would be a great blessing for the fishermen and the party and the country. Yu Qiaqing kowtows.</p>
<p>(2) Jiujiang, Mount Lu, respectfully presented to Chairman Jiang Jieshi: Upon hearing that the ministry is discussing reimposing the fisheries tax, fishery merchants and fishermen are running around in distress and telling each other. Last year, on March 28, a new decree was issued clearly exempting the fisheries tax. A sudden reversal now, how can we show good faith to the people? Moreover, the fishery industry has declined greatly, and the fishermen are already in a dangerous situation of bankruptcy. To drain the pond to catch fish is not a good idea. It is hoped that you will uphold the exemption that was previously in effect and maintain it in the future. Please immediately telegraph the Executive Yuan and the ministry to cancel the original proposal. It would be a great blessing for the fishery industry and the party and the country. Yu Qiaqing kowtows.</p>

<p>A Public Banquet for Tang Huisun from All Walks of Life</p>
<p>At 6:00 PM the night before last, people from all walks of life held a public banquet at the Atlantic Restaurant on Sima Road for Mr. Tang Huisun, the former director of the Agricultural Affairs Office of the three provinces of Henan, Shaanxi, and Gansu, who had recently returned from an inspection tour in the West. Those who attended included Tang's companions, entomology expert Cai Banghua, forestry expert Lin Weifang, Chen Zhenpeng, a technical expert from the Ministry of Interior, Wu Juenong, a technical official from the Ministry of Industry, Pan Xixiang, the director of the Wuxi Silkworm Seed Manufacturing Factory, Wu Hengru, the chief of the second section of the Social Affairs Bureau, Song An, the director of affairs of Lehua Girls' Middle School, Guo Ping of the Quanchong Guild, Wang Chengjun, a consultant to the Qingdao Municipal Government, Shi Shukang, a representative of the Agricultural College of Zhejiang University, Sheng Siding, a representative of Zhengfeng Girls' Middle School, Tang Hanlin, a lawyer and older brother of Tang, and Mrs. Brainerman, a newly hired German professor, totaling more than 30 people.</p>
<p>Chairman Zhou Dingchang gave a banquet speech, stating that Mr. Tang had profound research on agricultural administration. This time, Zhejiang Province sent him to Europe and the West to inspect agricultural administration, and he traveled to more than 20 countries. After returning to China, he must have a detailed and good plan for revitalizing China's current declining and exhausted agricultural administration.</p>
<p>Recent photo of Tang Huisun</p>
<p>Mr. Cai Banghua and Mr. Lin Weifang have studied in Western Europe and have many writings. They are expected to make great contributions to the two sciences of entomology and forestry. Mrs. Brainerman is a famous German scholar who has traveled a long distance to China to teach. We are even more deeply impressed.</p>
<p>Tang then gave a speech stating that our country has a vast territory and abundant resources. There are many agricultural fields where mines have not been opened or excavated. As long as the people do their best and fulfill their responsibilities, working hard, the imperialists, although ambitious, will eventually bow down and admire our country one day. I hope that all sectors of society will join hands and come together, which will not only be a blessing for our 400 million compatriots, but also a blessing for the weak nations of the East.</p>
<p>Mr. Cai Banghua and Mr. Lin Weifang then gave speeches and reported on their experiences and feelings during their trip to Europe, with many poignant words (details omitted). Finally, Mr. Chen Zhenpeng encouraged his comrades who had returned to China to continue to work hard with the attitude of a world-class academic researcher in order to obtain considerable benefits.</p>
<p>The banquet ended at around 9:00 PM. Also, it is reported that Mr. Tang Huisun will immediately pack his bags and go to Zhejiang University to teach.</p>

<p>A Vendetta Case Occurs in Western Shanghai</p>
<p>▲Approximately 30 Years Old</p>
<p>▲More Than 20 Stab Wounds</p>
<p>The Sixth District Second Sub-Station of the Xujiahui Town Municipal Public Security Bureau in Western Shanghai reported to the station at around 4:00 PM yesterday that a villager had reported finding an unidentified male corpse murdered in the cotton field north of the Zhujia Tomb Mountain behind Zhujia Stone Bridge on Xuhong Road in the west of the town.</p>
<p>Director Liu immediately sent police officer Xue Jinxian and others to investigate. The corpse, approximately 30 years old, was lying in the field with its head facing south and its feet facing north. There were more than 20 knife wounds on the head, face, neck, chest, etc. The wounds were approximately one inch wide. The eyeballs were protruding, the flesh was blurred, and the scene was tragic. The upper body was wearing a blue striped foreign cloth turn-down collar shirt, blue old cloth trousers, white cotton socks, and pointed-toe shoes. The head was flat. He looked like a worker. It is assumed that he was murdered. There were many maggots on the head. It is likely that he had been dead for two or three days. A piece of white paper written in pencil was left by the roadside, with the words "Please, comrades, act as agents for the Jiangbei person, the one from Zhenjiang who comes the most, the one who abandons the most people, the black-hearted fried-hearted traitor" and a Shanghai Inland Water Company's 21st year October No. 1694 Xiaoqiaotou vegetable market stall No. 92 water price two jiao receipt, with a Tan Shunchang stamp on it. It was immediately taken to the station for investigation. Because time was short, the corpse was guarded by the local security chief Zhang Qintuan, and it will be examined this morning.</p>

<h3 id="e157">Mr. Qian Qizhong, Clerk of the Second Branch of the Commercial Court, Appeals <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>▲ Sentenced to One Year in Prison Due to the Ye Shantao Case</p>
<p>▲ Appeals the Original Verdict</p>
<p>Ye Shantao, a shareholder and director of the Gongfa Company, was previously sued by Dong Longxing and others, creditors of the Riyue Bank, for forgery. When the second instance was being conducted at the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, a man surnamed Wu suddenly visited Ye, claiming to be dispatched by Qian Qizhong, the clerk assigned by Judge Zhao Zhengtao who was hearing the case. He asked for a bribe of two thousand yuan, promising to give him an advantage in the case, otherwise, the debate would be reopened, and it would certainly be disadvantageous. Ye ignored him. Later, the case was pronounced on June 27, sentencing Ye to three months in prison, suspended for one year. After receiving the verdict, Ye believed that the presiding judge and clerk were adding charges because their demand for money was not met. In addition to declaring his disapproval of the verdict, he filed an appeal with the Supreme Court. Furthermore, his attorney, Lu Shaozong, officially wrote to the Ministry of Judicial Administration of the National Government, requesting a thorough investigation. Subsequently, Minister Luo instructed Chief Prosecutor Wang of the Second Branch of the High Court to order Chief Prosecutor Zu Ze of the First Special District Local Court to conduct a strict investigation. Chief Prosecutor Wang summoned Qian Qizhong, clerk of the Second Branch of the High Court, to court for several interrogations. At the same time, he personally went to the Second Branch of the High Court to inquire with Judge Zhao Zhengtao of the Criminal Division, who was handling the Ye case, about Qian's inquiries into the case details at that time. After the investigation was concluded, it was determined that Qian Qizhong was suspected of attempted fraud and dereliction of duty. Therefore, based on the Criminal Law, he was prosecuted to the Criminal Court of the same level. After Judge Wu Zhen's trial, the defendant was sentenced to one year in prison and allowed to be detained in the court's detention center during the appeal period. However, Qian was unconvinced after receiving the verdict. Because the first instance treated this case as a primary case, he could only appeal to the local court of the original court. The grounds for his appeal were detailed in both factual and legal points. However, the prosecutor of the initial prosecution also disagreed with some parts of the first instance verdict and had also filed an appeal. Yesterday afternoon, Qian Hongye, Chief Judge of the Criminal Court of the First Special District, along with Judges Shen Bingying, Ge Sidong, and Prosecutor Guo Wei, specially opened a criminal court to summon witness Ye Shantao and examine Qian's case. Qian Qizhong presented his appeal, claiming that he was assigned to Judge Zhao Zhengtao when he was a clerk in the Second Branch of the High Court. The initial verdict of his guilt was based on Judge Zhao's testimony. However, Judge Zhao was the first defendant, and it was difficult to accept his words as the basis for convicting a co-defendant. Moreover, his statements before and after were often inconsistent. He had only gone to Zhao's place twice. Once was in early June, when Zhao returned to Shanghai from Suzhou and gave him melon seeds, so he went to his residence to thank him. The other time was after the verdict of the Ye case, Zhao had also come to his residence four times. This was simply a social interaction and there was no solicitation. As for the so-called Mr. Wu, he first said he was sent by the clerk when he went to Ye's house, and then claimed to be a representative of the judge. Who exactly was Wu? He did not want to, so his words were even less credible. The debate in the Ye case concluded on June 21, and he was transferred to the Document Section on the same day. Chief Judge Qian then read to Qian the confession of Judge Zhao during the investigation, in which Zhao said that Qian had gone to his house twice to inquire about how the Ye case would be judged. He also asked that if there was no solicitation, why did Zhao make this confession? Qian replied that only Judge Zhao himself knew the reason. However, according to Ye Shantao's confession, he learned on June 24 that the case would be reopened for debate. According to Judge Zhao, he only told him about the reopening of the debate on the 25th. These two statements were inconsistent. He and Ye did not know each other. Subsequently, witness Ye Shantao testified that a man surnamed Wu visited him around 3 or 4 pm on June 24, claiming to be sent by Clerk Qian, asking him to embellish the case. He initially asked for five or six thousand yuan, then reduced it to two thousand yuan, otherwise, the case would not be pronounced on the 27th and would have to be reopened for debate. He also said that if he did not believe him, he could bring the clerk with him the next day. However, only Wu came alone the next day, so he never fell for his scam. He also knew that his case was justified and would not lose the lawsuit. His lawyer, Lu Shaozong, also advised him not to be deceived. Later, the case sentenced him to three months in prison. He was extremely angry and believed that he was convicted because the extortion failed. He discussed it with Lawyer Lu, and Lu wrote to the Ministry of Justice to investigate, stating that he and Clerk Qian did not know each other. Chief Judge Qian pointed out that Ye's confession was somewhat different from what he stated in his letter to the Ministry of Justice, so he repeatedly questioned him. After the defending lawyer for Qian Qizhong presented his arguments, Chief Judge Qian ordered that the case files of Ye Shantao be reviewed and a date be set for further interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Wu Huaichun Accused of Rape of Two Daughters <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>▲ Young Daughter Dies from Rape</p>
<p>▲ Older Daughter Enticed and Abandoned</p>
<p>▲ Mother Files a Private Prosecution</p>
<p>▲ Asks for Conviction and Compensation for Losses</p>
<p>Wu Huaichun, residing at No. 24, Jiwu Fang, Ximen Road, Yinyu Company, and Fan Guilin, residing at No. 2, Zengrong Li, west of Beichujia Bridge in the French Concession, were recently sued by Shi Chen, a woman from Changshu, and her 19-year-old daughter Jinghua, who entrusted lawyers He Yijun and Yu Peng to file a private prosecution with the Second Court of the Special District for crimes of raping a young daughter, causing her death, and raping and enticing her older sister, etc. The indictment stated that they were accused of raping a young daughter, resulting in death, and raping and enticing her sister, maliciously abandoning her. It requested the court to detain and interrogate them, severely punish them according to the law, and also included a civil lawsuit. Shi Chen had two daughters, the elder being Jinghua and the younger being Lingyu. Jinghua was born on the 19th day of the first lunar month of the third year of the Republic of China, and Lingyu was born on the 25th day of the ninth lunar month of the seventh year of the Republic of China. They both studied poetry and books in their youth. In November of the 19th year, Lingyu came to Shanghai with relatives and resided at the home of the second defendant, Fan Guilin, at Chujia Bridge. Lingyu had a beautiful appearance. After the first defendant met her, he enticed her in various ways. Lingyu was only thirteen years old and her awareness was weak, so she lost her virginity to the first defendant. In the fourth lunar month of this year, she was enticed by him to live together at No. 14, Chengqing Li, Bair Road. Lingyu, at this age, was not fully developed, and she was devastated and fell ill and died on the 15th day of the fifth lunar month (i.e., June 18th) at the Red Cross Hospital on Haige Road. When she was seriously ill, Jinghua, mindful of sisterly affection, rushed to Shanghai from her hometown day and night to take care of her, not closing her eyes for seven or eight days. On the night of the 24th day of the fourth lunar month (i.e., May 29th), Jinghua, unable to overcome her fatigue, fell asleep on the bed for the first time. Who knew that the first defendant suddenly had evil thoughts and developed beastly desires? Taking advantage of Jinghua's sleep, he secretly untied her trousers and forcibly raped her. When the two sexes made contact, Jinghua woke up and resisted, but it was impossible. The first defendant threatened that alarming the patient would hasten her death. Jinghua had no choice but to let him do as he pleased. Afterwards, Jinghua was filled with shame and pain and wished she could die. The first defendant repeatedly used sweet words to deceive her and threatened her at the same time, insisting that Jinghua live with him and promising to cancel Jinghua's engagement with her fiancé. Jinghua was inexperienced and was moved by him, so she followed him and lived together in the Wuling Apartment on Bair Road. Who knew that the first defendant would become tired of her after a long time and his attitude would change drastically after a few months, abandoning Jinghua. Jinghua had no choice but to return to her hometown, harboring grievances and weeping all day long. Shi Chen felt that something was wrong. After questioning, she learned that the first defendant was so unlawful and no better than a beast. Shi and Jinghua came to Shanghai on the 21st of this month to negotiate with him. The first defendant relied on his wealth and power and ignored them. He especially maliciously abandoned Jinghua. The first defendant first raped a young daughter, causing her death. Then he raped and enticed Jinghua, and finally abandoned her, insulting women to the extreme. His actions clearly violated Article 240, Paragraph 2 and Paragraph 4 of the Criminal Law, the crime of raping a young daughter causing death, the crime of taking advantage of the opportunity to rape in Article 241 of the same law, the crime of enticing a young daughter in Article 257 of the same law, and the crime of abandonment in Article 290 of the Criminal Law. The second defendant is suspected of assisting the first defendant in raping the young daughter and should also be dealt with according to the law. Although the first defendant owns property worth over one million yuan in Shanghai, the facts of his crime are very serious.

<h3 id="e160">Commander Zhang Ying Extorted by Discharged Soldiers <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>▲ Discharged Soldiers Claimed Commander Deducted Pay</p>
<p>▲ Feared He Would Flee, So They Sought Him Out</p>
<p>Zhang Ying, who resided at No. 3 Qingfu Li, Jing'an Temple Road, and was formerly the commander of the 59th Division of the National Revolutionary Army, was suddenly visited by four discharged soldiers from the division, Li Shuliang, Jiang Qingmei, Wang Gancheng, and Tang Yun, around 12:00 on the 22nd of last month. They broke into Zhang's house, searching for Commander Zhang and his wife, and threatening them with handguns. When they saw that Mr. and Mrs. Zhang were not there, they left in disappointment. The next day, they received a letter from them extorting 50,000 yuan, asking to meet near the Tiantong'an Railway Station. Zhang's family reported it to the police station. Chinese Detectives Jin Yangwu, Yang Xinzheng, Wu Jiwen, etc., went and arrested Li, Jiang, and Wang, while Tang was at large. They were sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention, as detailed in previous reports. Yesterday morning, the Special Court continued the interrogation. The police station sent Li and the others to the court. The police station's lawyer, Wang Yaotang, presented the case and submitted the threatening letter and the confession statements of the defendants. Witness Cui Xianting also testified that the defendants came on the 22nd of last month with handguns, claiming to be looking for Commander Zhang's wife and son, saying that they were there to avenge the killing of the division's member Zheng by Commander Zhang. When they saw that the wife was not there, they went upstairs to search and left. The next day, they received a threatening letter and reported it to the police to send detectives to arrest them. Defendant Wang Gancheng confessed that Commander Zheng of the 59th Division was shot and killed by Commander Zhang last month for asking Commander Zhang to pay the arrears of salary. Not only were they indignant at the time, but all the soldiers of the division unanimously expressed their indignation. However, they were not subordinate to Commander Zheng's department. The reason for this was that Commander Zhang had deducted military pay, and the soldiers reported it to the Military Commission, which ordered an investigation. Fearing that he would escape upon hearing the news, they came to Shanghai to find him. Furthermore, Commander Zhang was proficient in martial arts and very strong. Fearing that they could not defeat him, they borrowed two handguns from a friend, preparing to hand him over to the police after finding the commander. He said that the threatening letter was written by Tang Yun, who was on the run, and he did not know about it. Tang had told him that he had reached an agreement with Commander Zhang, who agreed to borrow 2,000 yuan to return to his hometown. He could go to Tiantong'an tomorrow to meet the representative of Commander Zhang carrying a leather suitcase, and invite him to Hongkou Park. He went there and was arrested. When questioned, Li and Jiang's confessions were the same as Wang's. After the two lawyers debated, Judge Ge Sidong reviewed the confession and concluded the debate of the case, setting the verdict for next Tuesday. The defendants were still taken back to the police station for detention.</p>

However, there has been no retail service, which has led to requests from various sectors and restaurants. It is now learned that the store will set up a retail department starting on October 5th, with particularly reasonable prices to repay the sincerity of all sectors. It is heard that Xiamen pomelos are priced at seven for one dollar, Tianjin pears are priced at ten pounds for one dollar, and bananas are priced at eight pounds for one dollar.

<h3 id="e189">Prohibition of Private High Schools <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>One of the proposals passed by the meeting of education bureau directors is to prohibit private middle schools from adding high school divisions. This is a severe measure to eliminate private middle schools. It has been resolutely and bravely proposed and passed, and the day of implementation is probably not far off. However, what will happen after implementation?</p>
<p>Recently, it has been extremely difficult for junior high school graduates to enter provincial high schools. The number of places is only dozens, but the number of applicants is often seven or eight hundred, or even close to a thousand. This is the situation in Jiangsu. It is said that the Guangzhou area is even more crowded, with thousands of junior high school students competing for these dozens of high school places. The qualification for high school is simply unattainable, similar to passing the imperial examination and becoming a successful candidate in the old times. Every time the list of successful candidates is announced, it causes great sorrow among many who failed, teaching them to taste the flavor of taking the county exam during the imperial examination era. At this moment, their only savior is the provincial high school. Although it is full and regrettably lacking, private high schools still have surplus places to fill. At least half of these failed junior high school graduates rely on being accommodated in private high schools to avoid being out of school.</p>
<p>If private high schools are prohibited, and public high schools cannot be specially expanded and added according to the proportion of junior high school graduates, then every time junior high schools graduate, the number of junior high school graduates who cannot study will suddenly double. In the past, failed county examination candidates could rely on their ability to recite Confucius and Mencius to make a living as tutors. What is the level of junior high school graduates now? They cannot write essays and cannot carry water. Cutting off their path to advancement, what do you want them to do sitting at home all day?</p>
<p>Esteemed directors of education bureaus, did you have a hard time at the meeting? Are you all well? May I ask, in passing this magnificent proposal, are you encouraging reading or advocating for people to be out of school?</p>
<h3 id="e190">China's Soldiers <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Qi Wo</p>
<p>In his article "Observing Turbulent China," Japanese scholar Tsurumi Yusuke said that a certain politician, a former prime minister of China, once told him: "Today's China is like medieval Europe. For example, if you ask a soldier, 'What kind of soldier are you?' he will immediately answer, 'I am General Zhang's soldier,' 'I am General Feng's soldier,' 'I am General Tang's soldier.' Three hundred years ago, when soldiers in the streets of Paris were arguing, if you asked them what kind of soldiers they were, they would answer, 'I am a soldier of the Duke of Neschli,' or 'I am a soldier of the Duke of Olen.' But what about now? Everyone says they are soldiers of the French Republic. "China is the same. At present, soldiers all say they are Zhang's soldiers, Tang's soldiers, Feng's soldiers. When that day comes, perhaps they will answer that they are soldiers of the Republic of China. Until that day arrives, the current state will continue!"</p>
<p>This comparison between modern China and medieval Europe not only makes these foreign observers feel deeply interested, but even those of us in the country who are concerned about politics feel that this statement truly reveals China's current hidden problem! Honestly speaking, although China's cities are immersed in the color of 20th-century capitalism, and China's politics are adorned with many golden signs, the soldiers in China are still nothing more than warriors from the feudal era, and the military leaders in China are nothing more than feudal lords. Zhang cannot mobilize Feng's soldiers, just as Feng cannot mobilize Zhang's soldiers. Feng's soldiers belong to Feng, and Zhang's soldiers belong to Zhang. No one else can control them. What is the difference between this and the Five Hegemons and Seven Heroes of the Warring States period?</p>
<p>With such a feudal-style army, China will never be unified. No matter how much politics is on the right track and the economy is prosperous, if the military still has factionalism in their hearts, it will all be in vain! I believe that the day when Chinese soldiers understand that they are soldiers of the Republic of China will be the time when China is truly unified, and the time when the crisis of civil war in China is forever eliminated.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Five-Flavored People <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Zongwen</p>
<p>Sour, Bitter, Sweet, Spicy, Salty</p>
<p>Yesterday's dinner at home was not very satisfactory, why? Because: the vinegar fish was too sour, the smoked chicken was too bitter, the pineapple honey soup was too sweet, the mustard chicken was too spicy, and the salted duck was too salty. Therefore, none of these dishes suited everyone's taste. Everyone said in unison: "This chef is not very good!"</p>
<p>Because of yesterday's meal, I thought of how we humans are not so different. A person's mental attitude is different due to the inherent instincts and the environment of life, thus creating different personalities, just like the five flavors in a dish, but not so obvious.</p>
<p>(1) Sour people are mostly forced by the environment and become humble after repeated setbacks. Although this type of person's strength lies in humility, there will be no arrogance. However, if he is asked to handle a matter alone, he will inevitably delay the opportunity due to a lack of decisiveness! (2) Bitter people are depressed all day long, and it is not easy to see a smile on their faces. Their words are also full of bitterness. This type of person is mostly those who are frustrated, unemployed, or heartbroken. It is not easy to hope for their development!</p>
<p>(3) Sweet people are always optimistic and good at understanding people's psychology, taking people's intentions as their own. His strength lies in making people not dislike him, but he has no independent opinions. If things go wrong, there is no solution!</p>
<p>(4) Spicy people are bold and daring. No matter what happens, he can make judgments and have solutions. He does not care about feelings, does what he thinks of, and speaks frankly and deeply. But he is just stubborn and does not listen to other people's advice, and he will make things worse!</p>
<p>(5) Salty people, saying that this type of person is stupid, but not stupid. Saying that he is smart, but not smart. If there is no clear person to guide him well, the future is the most dangerous!</p>
<p>Therefore, it is important for people to be moderate. People who contain only one flavor, although they have strengths, cannot hide their weaknesses and must be cultivated. Otherwise, it will be like a dish with only one flavor, and no one will want to learn from it!</p>
<h3 id="e192">Powerful Tragedy <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Ming Yi</p>
<p>Guaranteed to Make You Cry</p>
<p>The success of film art lies entirely in its power to move people. Figures like Clara Bow, who use "flesh" to attract attention, are not considered moving, so they are only praised by a group of erotic maniacs.</p>
<p>Lillian Gish's mournfulness and Ann Harding's poignancy do have a very deep power to move people. Films like "Revenge" and "Orchid of the Empty Valley" leave an indelible mark in the depths of the audience's hearts.</p>
<p>This can also be said to be a somewhat comforting thing! Among all the Chinese actresses, there is not a flashy star like Clara Bow, but there is a tragic star who combines the strengths of Lillian Gish and Ann Harding. Who is she? She is Chen Yumei, who advocates frugality to save the country.</p>
<p>She had already made a good impression on the audience in the silent film era. Since starring in the sound films "Aunt Yunlan" and "One Night of Luxury," the audience's faith in her has been further guaranteed. Her lily-like clear and beautiful appearance, lake-like quiet temperament, and seagull-like ethereal attitude are fully expressed on the screen, making people feel as if they are in a poetic and picturesque realm, looking up at the bright moon and listening to the flowing spring.</p>
<p>Her most recent film, "The Lost Trail in Orchid Valley," is a grand tragedy depicting the oppression under feudal society! I dare to believe that if this film were starred by another actor, at most, they would move the tragic story to the screen without missing a single detail, which would be considered fulfilling their duty. But she really does more than that! When the film had an unofficial test screening at the New Light Theater the day before yesterday, several fragile-hearted women were crying aloud when they saw the last few scenes. When the lights were turned on, everyone in the audience had red eyes. No matter what tragedy a reporter watches, they only admire its artistic quality and will never cry. The reason is, "Crying while listening to storytelling is worrying about the ancients." It's too silly, but that day my eyes were a little moist, because the several close-up shots in the hospital gave me too deep a stimulus!</p>
<p>It is said that "The Lost Trail in Orchid Valley" will be released to the public soon. Undoubtedly! Chen Yumei's art will give us a deeper understanding!</p>

<p>— Seeking Happiness</p>
<p>Today, a wife of a high-ranking officer named Gao came to my house. My aunt specially introduced me to her, which held me back from coming to meet you earlier. However, that is a small matter. I also heard them talking about how Officer Gao's superior, Commander Li, wanted to find a young female student to be his fifth concubine. This Mrs. Gao was planning to recommend me. If the matter is successful, not only will she get a sum of money, but she also promised to promote my uncle to be a county magistrate or a tax bureau director. There are so many benefits, and what is sacrificed is only my irrelevant, poor child. How could my aunt and uncle not be happy to comply? I was very anxious when I heard this. As soon as the clock struck seven, I made the excuse of going out to attend a night tutoring class, grabbed my bag and rushed here, wanting to discuss with you a good way to deal with and rescue me." After saying this, she began to sob softly.</p>
<p>"This is outrageous!" After a moment of silence and distress, he suddenly let go of her hands and clenched his fist in the air, gesturing and saying, "What right do they have to sell you to someone else as the fifth concubine through a business transaction? Won't you defend your right to freedom of marriage and not recognize this illegal marriage contract and resist them officially?"</p>
<p>"It's easy for you to say," she said with a bitter smile. "Of course, I don't recognize their selling me by such despicable and devious means. If it weren't for this, I wouldn't have come to tell and discuss with you. But you have to think more for me. I am a weak woman. No matter how hard I resist them, I can only argue with them in words on the surface and cannot prevent them from plotting and scheming at any time. There will be many dangers in the future. I can't stay in this pit of fire anymore! I need to get away from them as soon as possible and find my own way out!"</p>
<p>She became more and more excited as she spoke, and her voice became higher and more passionate. But when she said this, she suddenly changed to a more intimate tone and seductive attitude, slowly approaching him, as if she were delicate and powerless, wanting to lean on him. He, because he had never experienced such great tenderness, was a little shy. Also, due to the large number of tourists in the garden, he was afraid of being laughed at, so he stepped back little by little. But she could not restrain herself and followed him closely. Finally, she grabbed his left arm, placed half of her face diagonally on his shoulder, and softly said to a slightly secluded grassy slope behind the pavilion, "Brother Boqin! Don't you understand my heart? In the past two months, I met you at your cousin's English tutoring night school, and we became very good friends. My passionate heart is almost completely dedicated to you! The only difference is that my entire body has not yet been formally entrusted to you.</p>
<p>If something like this happens, I will be taken by someone else if I am not careful. At this critical moment, I can no longer hesitate so much and ruin my life. I can only frankly express myself to you, asking you to accept my pure love as a virgin, rescue me from this sinful and dangerous realm, let me be protected and cherished by you for the rest of my life, and jointly create a beautiful and happy new life!"</p>

<p>The (4th) Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange market trading situation yesterday: There was virtually no trading in November futures, and even October futures were very quiet, as prices were stagnant and investor sentiment was cold. The morning trading volume was 900,000 yuan, and the afternoon volume was just over 1 million yuan, totaling 1,945,000 yuan. There were only scattered spot trades, perhaps 20,000 yuan worth. As for price movements, the situation was dull, with little new development and a general cooling of market sentiment. Trading was sparse, and price fluctuations were minimal, resulting in mixed gains and losses compared to the previous day, with the difference only around two jiao.</p>

<p>A report from Xinfeng Foreign Firm states that on Monday (3rd), the New York stock market was extremely chaotic. Nickel Plate Railroad was unable to pay the principal and interest on its 6% gold bond maturing on October 1, which negatively impacted the market. Stocks declined as a result, particularly railroad stocks. Trading was unusually sparse, with a total daily volume of 1 million shares. Closing prices for major stocks were: Allied Chemical 80 (dollars), American Telephone &amp; Telegraph 112, American Water Works 26, Canadian Pacific Railway 16.5, Curtiss-Wright 18, Consolidated Gas of New York 60.75, Drug, Inc. 39, General Motors 42, Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber 23, International Telephone &amp; Telegraph 13, Loew's 32, Paramount Pictures 5, Pennsylvania Railroad 19, New York Central Railroad 285, Radio Corporation of America 9.5, Simmons Bedding 12, Southern Pacific Railroad 74, United States Steel 42.125, Woolworth 40.

<p>The cotton yarn market is weak, with a very poor outlook and mostly bearish sentiment. There are rumors that a short seller has taken a position in 1,000 bales of 20-count Dashen spinning factory yarn at a price of 155 taels, with talk of delivering this month's yarn contracts. This has made investors nervous. However, the Rongxing bull remains unmoved, showing that both sides are strongly competing. By the afternoon close, market sentiment had stabilized somewhat, and spot yarn was stronger than yesterday.</p>
<p>▲ Renbiao Market Sentiment Softens: At the opening of the Renbiao market, American cotton rose slightly by a few points, but market sentiment was very weak. Prices for all months declined by 4 to 7 qian. Market sentiment was even weaker in the afternoon, with further declines of 2, 3, or 4 qian for all months. Total daily trading volume was 13,100 bales. Yichang sold 1,050 bales, Xincheng 650 bales, Dachang 800 bales, Tongfu 600 bales, and Yongda 500 bales. Huaixin bought 1,500 bales, Mingde 750 bales, and Changfeng 800 bales.

<p>The cotton market is weak again. Although the situation in the American cotton market is relatively stable, favorable domestic weather and a good new crop have strengthened bearish sentiment. There are rumors that a manufacturer has pre-purchased 30,000 dan of standard October cotton from the Huoji factory, but the price is unclear, and there are concerns that this is just speculation. This has made investors nervous, and many are liquidating positions. Spot cotton is not being handled by various factories, resulting in a very disorganized market.</p>
<p>▲ Zhengbiao Market Lacks Buyers: At the opening of the Zhengbiao market, the situation was weak due to a lack of buyers, with declines of 2 to 3 qian. There were further declines of 0.5 to 1.5 qian in the afternoon. Total daily trading volume was 42,700 dan. Tongfu sold 2,100 dan, Zhenda 3,000 dan, Yiyu 2,300 dan, Yuanda 2,000 dan, Yichang 1,600 dan, and Xincheng 1,800 dan.

<p>▲ Spot Cotton Mills Adopt a Wait-and-See Approach: Spot cotton sales are quiet again. Due to favorable weather, manufacturers are taking a wait-and-see approach. Supplies from various sources are pouring in. Yao cotton: 3,780 bales. Tong cotton: 566 bales. Spot cotton offers are as follows:</p>
<p>| Cotton Type        | Price   | Notes                                           |</p>

<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market was mixed as it awaited the government report. It initially weakened due to the slump on Wall Street but then strengthened due to short covering. Futures rose by 2 to 8 points, and spot prices rose by 10 points. British cotton futures fell by 10 to 11 points, and spot prices fell by 4 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 25 points. Indian cotton was closed. The original telegram is recorded below (telegram of the 3rd):</p>

<p>▲ Shanghai Southern Suburbs Rice Market Yesterday: About 25 or 26 ships arrived from various regions. There were considerable stockpiles in the suburbs. Stores in cities and towns took advantage of the opportunity to increase inventory. Changshu, Wuxi, Northern Jiangsu, and White/Red Rice and New Rice all opened down by 2 jiao. Foreign Du Tips and Lingbai Tips continued to be purchased by buyers, causing prices to increase slightly. The other goods were unchanged.</p>
<p>▲ New Zha District: Yesterday's Lane: 30-40 ships arrived from various regions. The main street's sales were still active. The situation for various seeds was tight. Foreign Tips arrived and were sold at opposing prices with no increase or decrease. Limited purchases of old, broken rice from Jiangyin and Changzhou with small price fluctuations of 2 or 3 jiao. Total daily river shipments were about 3,000 dan.</p>

<p>The foreign rice market was slightly more active yesterday. Because a Fuzhou merchant was inquiring in the market, market sentiment stabilized. The Fuzhou merchant purchased 300 small bags. No one inquired about other rice types. Dong merchants' sales were not active. Because of the low price in Shanghai, some were willing to buy some. However, with uncertain sales prospects, prices could not improve. Overall, there are still plenty of stocks. The new rice shipments will not be able to rally unless there is a big merchant to buy. Total daily transactions besides Fuzhou's purchase of small bags were: the main street merchant bought 100 bags of Saigon rice, Ningbo merchant bought 40 bags of Hunan Yuan rice, all with prices similar to the morning: small bags opened at 8 yuan 6 jiao; Saigon opened at 9 yuan 2 and a half jiao; Hunan Rice opened at 12 yuan 4 jiao.</p>

<p>About 100,000 bags of foreign rice were sold in Shanghai in September. The total rice inventory in the various foreign warehouses at the end of September was still 731,400 bags. The largest warehouses were Longmao, Yitaixing, and Zhaoshang Zhongzhan, as listed below (in thousands of bags):</p>

<p>Yesterday's flour market opened with a flat and then attractive outlook. Because foreign wheat prices briefly declined by 1-2 jiao, the market initially seemed weak. However, Tianjin merchants became active. Active purchases occurred for the current month (reportedly, purchases for troop transport require an additional 3 fen). Forward contracts were also purchased. Furthermore, major flour mills did not offer sales. Small mills such as Xiang Xinhuafeng did try to sell, but due to solid sales, investor sentiment rose. Prices rose by 1.5 fen compared to the previous day's closing. By the afternoon, near and far-term prices were hovering in place. Because overall, there were few positive signs as there are rumors of an Australian harvest, with private telegrams quoting 3.9 taels. Canadian wheat was quoted at just 3.77-8 taels. As domestic rice prices decline, it seemed impossible to achieve a natural average. Flour mills will have no advantages in the future.

<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market hovered and showed a slight upward trend. Although foreign wheat prices declined slightly by 1-2 jiao, there were no large sellers on the market. Many firms had contracted for foreign wheat last year and had plenty of delivery orders. This year, although foreign wheat prices are lower, most of those contracting are factories, and few traders are asking. Therefore, although the environment is not good, it is considered dangerous to completely sell all positions. Once trading stabilized, the market outlook improved. As a result, October and November each improved by 1 fen compared to the previous day, December to February each improved by 2 fen, March improved by 1 fen, spot wheat delivery was mixed, and no new sales have opened in the whole city.</p>

<p>A report from Xinfeng Foreign Firm states that on Tuesday (3rd), Chicago wheat fell by 0.375 to 0.5 points due to short selling. Total daily trading volume was 10 million bushels. Listed below are the market prices from the 3rd:</p>

<p>Already Reaching Over 900 Bales</p>
<p>The Zhejiang autumn cocoon markets in Hangzhou, Shaoxing, Huzhou, and Jiaxing have all closed. The fresh cocoons collected by most silk and cocoon merchants have all been dried and are being transported to Shanghai in batches by both water and land. So far, over 954 bales of dried cocoons have arrived. These are all raw materials collected by silk factories in Shanghai and are now being transported back to the factories to be reeled.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the foreign trading tea market was slightly active. The English firm Jinlong Foreign Firm is reportedly buying several hundred boxes of Tunxi ordinary village Zhenmei green tea, with a price of 80 taels. Yihe, Fushi, and other firms are also slightly interested in Zhenmei and Xiumei teas. The Russian Xieyi Association is also showing increased interest in Gongxi green tea. However, all tea prices are declining, and it is difficult to consider the market outlook positive.</p>

<p>After the price of blue lead rose, transactions once progressed, but financial constraints limited purchases by merchants, and factories also purchased little due to limited payments by merchants. As a result, prices fluctuated around 12.2-3 taels. Yesterday, the market price of 12.5 taels was achieved. According to investigations</p>

<p>In the spot tin market, the previous increase in Singapore and London drove up prices in the local market as well. Initially, end-users and merchants took advantage of the opportunity to monopolize the market, resulting in considerable actual transactions. However, due to tight credit conditions, the upward trend inevitably stalled, leading to a significant decrease in outgoing orders. As for market prices, due to the shortage of incoming goods and dwindling inventories, prices have been maintained at current levels without falling. Dutch tin is priced at 100 taels per dan, Fukien tin at 103 taels, Hengdi tin at 96.5 taels, Jianghua tin at 98 taels, sheet tin at 98.25 taels, Tongde tin at 96.5 taels, and hook light tin at 51.2 taels, while solder is at 50 taels.</p>

<p>The asphalt market should have been active after the Mid-Autumn Festival, but it has been sluggish this year. It has been weak since autumn, and it was initially thought to be a temporary situation, expecting a turnaround when autumn sales began. However, the market has continued to decline, deteriorating further. The situation is increasingly unmanageable, and panic is widespread. Hankou first lowered prices, followed by Hangzhou. Although local dealers do not have large inventories, they are affected by Hankou and Hangzhou. Moreover, Hangzhou can sell throughout the interior, further blocking sales channels. In Hankou, factory oil has fallen to 14 taels, and Chongjing oil has also dropped to 15.68 taels, although inventories are said to be low. However, sales cannot be maintained without price cuts. Hangzhou is experiencing even more chaotic and disorderly price cuts, with no fixed procedures. Prices have lost their standards. Although Neiping oil is quoted at 25 yuan, sales vary. Some customs oil with slight moisture is sold for less than 20 yuan, making a market price impossible. According to Hangzhou dealers, they have been losing ground whenever prices rise or fall in recent years. Those selling outside are even more disorganized, losing their direction and steps. This is also a market vicissitude. Local dealer prices are supposed to be fixed, but in this market, fixed prices are merely nominal. However, inventories are not high everywhere, and new supplies are still far off. Those who are calm are not worried, while those eager to sell are in a panic. Therefore, although the market is declining, attitudes vary.</p>

<h3 id="e216">From Improving Society to Promoting Children's Education <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Xun</p>
<p>If the statement "Today's children are the masters of tomorrow" is considered true, I urge parents and elders in society to pay more strict attention to children's education.</p>
<p>Children's minds are pure, and their spirits are lively. How should we nurture their keen thinking and instill rich intelligence? Let them build the nation and benefit society in the future. If we follow old habits and fail to provide good education, leading to thirteen- or fourteen-year-olds writing lengthy love letters and bizarre dramas of leaving home to seek immortality in the mountains, I cannot help but cry for the future of the nation!</p>
<p>Parents should first discipline themselves. Constant mahjong and card games at home can tempt children to gamble. Numerous servants can foster children's arrogance and laziness. Quick tempers and harsh words can cultivate children's stubbornness and snobbery. If parents do not eliminate bad habits themselves, discussing children's education is futile. Instead, bad influences may be deeply injected into children. I see many parasites in society and think of these irresponsible parents.</p>
<p>So-called children's education does not necessarily involve rigid and tedious lectures. At any time, in any place, and with any object, there are good opportunities to provide children with good education. I would like to write about a few of the most needed things.</p>
<p>1.  Cultivation of frugality, hardship tolerance, and a fair attitude.</p>
<p>2.  Instilling basic knowledge and scientific understanding.</p>
<p>3.  Planting the spirit of integrity, cooperation, and love.</p>
<p>4.  Practicing physical training and military exercises.</p>
<p>We are certainly not comparable to foreign societies in terms of economic wealth and the perfection of children's educational facilities. Therefore, children are indeed unfortunate not to enjoy profound and comprehensive education. However, at a minimum, we should promote the above four aspects of education to foster children's thinking and prepare them to be masters of the future.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that parents will not think that their children beating the neighbor's children means they have a brave spirit, or that constantly reading novels about flying swordsmen and immortals means their children are studious. And do not think that feeding children well and keeping them warm and plump is the end of your responsibility! You still need to consciously educate these children.</p>

<h3 id="e218">Prevention of Fruit Tree Diseases <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Hai Sha</p>
<p>This journal's science column has always been about industry and physical chemistry, and has not detailed issues such as agronomy. I will first describe an article on "Prevention of Fruit Tree Diseases" to contribute to this column, which I think readers will be happy to hear about.</p>
<p>Most Chinese people cultivate fruit trees by relying on favorable weather and geographical conditions, letting them grow naturally. They rarely have adequate research into pests and other diseases. Often, when fruit trees are harmed, they only know to cut off the damaged bark or branches, or pick off the affected fruit, but do not know to use medicine for prevention before diseases occur. Therefore, I have excerpted several points for horticulturalists to know.</p>
<p>(1) Pear and Apple Rot: This disease initially appears as reddish-brown, then slowly develops blisters. The skin becomes sticky and soft, often occurring on the branches of apples and pears. It is most likely to occur in unsettled weather. There is a milky white liquid inside, which gradually dries up, causing the fruit and branches to rot.</p>
<p>Treatment: Apply "Bordeaux mixture" (Bordeaux mixture recipe attached below) in early spring before the disease occurs to prevent it. If there is disease on the branches, they must be cut off and burned to prevent transmission.</p>
<p>(2) Pear Black Spot and Red Star Disease: This disease occurs on branches and young shoots, and also on the fruit. When it occurs on the fruit, the fruit is not symmetrical, and the diseased area will hinder growth. When it occurs on the leaves, it is black or sooty, with black spots in a circular shape that easily fall off when touched, causing the branches and leaves to slowly wither and fall off. Red star disease has the same symptoms, but the color is red, and the spots are smaller.</p>
<p>Treatment: Apply "Bordeaux mixture" during flowering and fruiting. However, do not apply it when a tree is in full bloom. Only pick off and burn the diseased leaves and fruit.</p>
<p>(3) Peach Leaf Curl: This disease occurs on peach leaves and young shoots, causing the leaves to become thick and curled. The inner layer of curled leaves turns grayish-white. Mild cases cause only yellowing and leaf drop, while severe cases will stop fruit growth.</p>
<p>Treatment: Spray "Bordeaux mixture" once when peach blossoms are about to open, once when they are in full bloom, and once after the petals fall off to avoid the disease.</p>
<p>Attached: Bordeaux Mixture Manufacturing Method: Ingredients: 1 catty of quicklime, 1 catty of copper sulfate (i.e., gallstone), 60 catties of clean water.</p>
<p>Tools: Two small wooden buckets (do not use copper or iron), one large wooden bucket, one chaff sieve (i.e., a bamboo sieve for sifting chaff).</p>
<p>Method: Fill the two small buckets with 4 or 5 catties of water. Place copper sulfate in one bucket and lime in the other. Stir the bucket with copper sulfate with a small stick until it is evenly mixed with the water, then pour in 25 catties of clean water. Then place the bamboo sieve on the large wooden bucket and simultaneously take the liquid from the two small buckets (stir the bucket with lime into a milky white color and mix with 25 catties of clear water) and pour it into the large bucket from the bamboo sieve. Discard the coarse material stopped by the sieve. At this time, stir the liquid in the large bucket with a stick, then immerse blue test paper (sold in pharmacies) in the liquid in the large bucket. If the paper does not change color, the liquid is successful. If it turns red, then add a little lime water to make the medicinal properties uniform, so as not to harm the fruit trees due to excessive strength.</p>

<h3 id="e219">My Views on Reforming Entertainment <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Tong Sheng</p>
<p>Indeed, everyone should have what is called entertainment as a human need. It is something we cannot lack and is an essential condition of life. Besides the necessities of food, clothing, and shelter, it is more important than anything else. Therefore, you see that regardless of whether it is in China or abroad, ancient or modern, regardless of farmers, merchants, laborers, or students, from the supreme to the poor worker, the wise or the foolish, everyone has one or more kinds of entertainment.</p>
<p>The basic condition of entertainment is to make us happy. It is a way to compensate the spirit and soothe the mind after mental and physical labor. It can strengthen our bodies, invigorate our spirits, and promote our careers. It is closely related to us and should not be despised or lacked.</p>
<p>The meaning and effect of entertainment have been briefly stated above, but looking at the current habits in Chinese society, we are too disappointed. It has not only lost the essence of entertainment but has also turned into a boring pastime. The entertainment that the public currently recognizes has already taken a deformed path, such as watching horse racing, dog racing, gambling, flower associations, etc. The most prevalent is mahjong.</p>
<p>There are many such bad social phenomena, and I cannot list them all for discussion. Now I will take mahjong as a representative. Looking at Shanghai as a basis, I can say decisively that about six or seven out of ten people play mahjong, and most of their lives are spent on it. Mahjong certainly has its fun, and we can appreciate it. However, they have become money worshippers in this fun, and they even regard it as a daily career, playing eight rounds and then another eight rounds, night after night, wanting to win some money. As a result, they get the following:</p>
<p>(1) Exhaustion of spirit</p>
<p>(2) Wasting time</p>
<p>(3) Wasting money</p>
<p>(4) Neglecting relatives and friends</p>
<p>(5) Cultivating laziness</p>
<p>(6) Promoting cunning</p>
<p>(7) Gambling away money and losing morale</p>
<p>The unreasonable entertainment in today's society has all these points, but they enjoy it and do not know how to abstain. They do not get the taste of entertainment but suffer much boredom, and even ruin their families and lives. This self-inflicted suffering is truly a pitiful thing.</p>
<p>In my humble opinion, the following work should be done on entertainment:</p>
<p>(A) Negative aspects</p>
<p>1.  The government should strictly prohibit unreasonable entertainment.</p>
<p>2.  Everyone should reflect on themselves and ask themselves "Why" after the fact, as Mr. Hu Shih said.</p>
<p>3.  The government should investigate and deal with places that sell unnecessary entertainment venues and tools.</p>
<p>(B) Positive aspects</p>
<p>1.  The government must vigorously promote public entertainment venues such as parks, sports fields, cinemas, and playgrounds.</p>
<p>2.  The government should conduct "conscious entertainment" propaganda.</p>
<p>3.  Encourage models of true entertainment.</p>
<p>4.  The government should act as a model for the public.</p>
<p>5.  Prepare conscious entertainment tools at home, such as organs, phonographs, chess, sports equipment, and play equipment.</p>
<p>6.  The head of the family should act as a model and guide their children to prevent them from going astray.</p>
<p>The entertainment problem in today's society really needs to be reformed, but no one notices it. My purpose in raising this issue is to hope that everyone will rise up and carry out reforms, and at least make everyone pay attention to this issue. That would be the greatest blessing of this article.</p>

<h3 id="e220">Be Careful with Coins! <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Heng</p>
<p>"Wang Ma, take this lead eight-cent coin and pay the vegetable seller, and tell him to give you back eight copper coins. Be careful! It doesn't matter! These country bumpkins don't know how to tell the difference between foreign coins. Didn't I pay him the same way last time? That's right! I remember he even gave me back more than three hundred cash! I got it for free!" Mrs. Li hadn't finished her proud words when Wang Ma had already taken the lead coin and walked out the door.</p>
<p>"Hey! Vegetable seller, here are two eight-cent coins. Give me back eight copper coins." Wang Ma followed her madam's orders and gave the lead coin to the vegetable vendor, but at the same time, with an attitude of pity and unfortunate sympathy, she softly said, "Be careful with coins."</p>
<p>"What a joke! Your family is a regular customer. How could you trick us?" After receiving the lead coin, the vendor, because he heard Wang Ma's advice, didn't even bother to look at the lead coin and quickly hid it. Quickly and hastily, he gave Wang Ma back eight copper coins. This was his extreme expression of belief and sincerity in gratitude to them! "Pig, real pig, hee!"</p>
<p>After receiving the eight copper coins, Wang Ma unnaturally laughed coldly, laughing and scolding the vendor according to her madam's criticism. Of course, it was not to despise him or be mean to him, but it really contained two meanings: pitying his stupidity and being annoyed that he could not accept her advice. However, since the country vendor, who had always been called a "pig" by customers, heard her say, he thought she was bantering with him.</p>
<p>Although the vendor didn't recognize the lead coin, the moneylender proved its identity to him two hours later. Needless to say, could the moneylender take such a lead coin? As a result, the vendor had to exchange another real coin for it. However, the family's living expenses for one day ended here. The vendor's wife also had a fight with her husband, forcing him to exchange it back from someone the next day, and saying, "Last time, using a lead eight-cent coin made the whole family hungry for a day. If we keep being blind like this, there will be a day when the whole family starves to death!" After a quarrel, she was so angry that she lay in bed and refused to get up!</p>
<p>Country people still have some pig-like temper. Having suffered this loss, how dare he ask someone to exchange it? Early the next morning, selling at the door of the Li's house, Mrs. Li and Wang Ma both came out and stopped him, bought vegetables and paid. The vendor sighed to Wang Ma:</p>
<p>"After all, your family is so proper. Yesterday, this old grandma even said to me, 'Be careful with coins.' Who knew that after I went back yesterday, I found two lead foreign coins, which made me pay the moneylender and I had no money for food. Poor my woman, she had a quarrel with me and went hungry, and she is still sick today!"</p>
<p>Mrs. Li smiled slightly at Wang Ma after hearing this, indicating her victory. Wang Ma didn't say a word, and only after the vendor turned his back did she sigh softly and weakly spit out two words:</p>
<p>"Pig."</p>
<p>School Scene</p>
<h3 id="e221">Make-up Exam <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Man Qian</p>
<p>S School can be said to be very famous in Shanghai! Their make-up exam system for students who fail is like this: Students who fail two subjects in an academic year are allowed to take a make-up exam. If they fail more than two subjects, they are not allowed to take a make-up exam and are announced to be repeating a year! Of course, if they can pass the make-up exam, they can be promoted. Otherwise, they will have to study for another year.</p>
<p>The school authorities are also very considerate of the students. Whenever a student happens to fail three subjects, they always add the score of the better subject to 60 points to give him a chance to take a make-up exam. Therefore, several years of history tell us that students who repeat a grade must have failed three or more subjects.</p>
<p>The make-up exams are usually held in the three days before the official start of classes after the start of the school year. As usual, each student has to pay one and a half yuan in make-up exam fees for each subject. The results of the make-up exams are usually PASS. Because the invigilation is not strict during the make-up exam, only a registrar who is always regarded as a plaything by the students stands there. Therefore, it is possible to cheat, such as having someone take the exam for you, sending missiles from the window sills, copying from cheating notes, passing exam papers, etc., all of which are common tricks. If you are really unlucky and your score is still not good, then you can go to the teacher who teaches the course to beg and plead before the results are announced. The stories of two students I know about the make-up exams this semester are good examples:</p>
<p>Student C, he had to take make-up exams for two subjects this semester, but he was too clear about the make-up exams, so he was very careless and didn't go to school until three days after the make-up exam had been held. According to the rules, those who do not ask for leave and do not take the make-up exam must repeat a year and will not be allowed to take the make-up exam again! However, F was an exception, but he was promoted unconditionally without being tested! Ah! The reason is that he is the nephew of the director of academic affairs.</p>
<p>F was also too careless. He always thought that the make-up exam was not a problem for promotion, so he just played all day during the summer vacation and threw the books aside without even looking at them. However, this time he was just unlucky. When he was taking the make-up exam for XX subject, he happened to meet the principal who came to inspect, so all his tricks and abilities could not be used. As a result, he had to bite the bullet and submit a blank paper! Of course, such a score is really too much. Even C himself knows his fault! Finally, for the sake of promotion, he had no choice but to lower his body and go to the teacher who taught the XX subject to beg! What teacher would be so picky as to make things difficult for others? Because of one subject, you will not be able to be promoted! So he was happy to do a favor, handed the blank paper back to F, and told him to rewrite it in the dormitory and submit it to the Academic Affairs Office. In this way, the difficult situation was solved!</p>
<p>Therefore, S School has no so-called make-up exam. As long as you are qualified to take the make-up exam, you will always PASS, but you have to pay one and a half yuan for each make-up exam!</p>
<p>No Way Out</p>
<h3 id="e222">Grief <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Hui</p>
<p>The pain and sorrow of unemployment for half a year filled his entire soul: all his grand ambitions and extravagant desires were exhausted! Every day, he just lived in "hope" and "expectation"! Waiting, waiting, hoping for tomorrow today: when tomorrow comes, he looks forward to the coming of next week. However, the gift that next week brings to him is still "pain" and "sorrow"?</p>
<p>Relatives and friends gradually expressed their helplessness. After his earnest requests, they finally put on a terrible look of disgust, saying as if reprimanding and caring at the same time: "It's not fun to be unemployed in Shanghai. Let us raise travel expenses for you to go back to your hometown."</p>
<p>Shanghai is indeed hopeless, but isn't going back to his hometown the same as having no chance of survival? His only hope is to start looking for job advertisements in newspapers.</p>
<p>"Ah, a ray of dawn!" When he discovered that a school wanted to hire a hardworking and tireless teacher, he was overjoyed, as if the god of victory had thrown himself into his arms! So he respectfully wrote an application letter with sincerity and eagerness, and went to the post office to register it and send it. On the third day, as he wished, he received a reply letter, the general meaning of which was: they had decided to hire him to take on the senior grade level, with a monthly salary of twenty yuan, calculated for four months per semester, without food and accommodation, forty hours of teaching per week, and requiring a cash deposit of sixty yuan. If he was willing to accept, he could bring the money within three days to negotiate. Although the treatment was harsh to the extreme, he thought it was better than waiting to die idle. Moreover, he had always had the character of "not being afraid of being busy, but worrying about being idle," so the burden of work was not a problem for him; the problem was the source of the deposit, which made him deeply troubled and anxious. He could not help but resent and curse the cruelty, cruelty, and hypocrisy of mankind. Would a primary school teacher abscond? He had no choice but to go and discuss it with relatives and friends who advised him to return to his hometown. After three whole days of running around, appealing, begging, and crying, he managed to raise less than twenty yuan. He was also afraid of delaying the appointment date, so he had no choice but to take the money to the school to discuss it! He asked them to accept the money first and deduct it from his salary later. However, the reply he received was:</p>
<p>"Sorry, we cannot accommodate you. This is the decision of the school board."</p>
<p>With glistening tears in his eyes, he stepped out of the school gate; he thought, "Am I destined to be a vagrant! Or is society giving me a special gift?"</p>
<p>Deceived</p>
<h3 id="e223">A Love Listening Gramophone <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Ben</p>
<p>The real, hypocritical, and morbid world is simply full of thorns and darkness. Slippery careers and deceptive dealings are like bamboo shoots after rain, more and more every day. The methods used are becoming more and more wonderful. If you are careless, you can fall into its trap. However, all kinds of scams cannot escape using "bait" to lure you into the game. Therefore, if you want not to be deceived, unless you adhere to the principle of "do not be greedy for small gains," then, even if there is "bait" in front of you, you will not be caught. If you do not do this and like to be greedy for small profits, you can form the fact of being deceived everywhere!</p>
<p>Mr. Shi next door is also a friend who is greedy for small gains. Whenever he discovers something cheap, he always rushes to be the first to take action, trying to get there first. However, the facts have told him several times that trying to get cheap always results in being taken advantage of instead. However, although he has encountered "trying to steal a chicken but losing the rice," he still has not realized it and is still often in the maze of "trying to get cheap," so this time there is another mess:</p>
<p>One day, he read a certain newspaper and found in the advertising column a cheap advertisement that said, "Give you a lovely small gramophone." Below was also attached a "Here is a coupon for two dollars. Please give us a Love Listening brand small gramophone, two records, and a box of steel needles. To the Advertising Department of Shanghai XX Foreign Firm." He was so happy that he jumped up after reading it, thinking that he could get a gramophone for the cost of only two dollars. It was really an unprecedentedly great bargain. He couldn't miss this wonderful and rare opportunity, and he could conclude that it was the foreigners (referring to foreign firms) who wanted to sell the "Love Listening" brand, so there was such a special great sacrifice. In the future, when their brand is sold, don't say they will give it away, I'm afraid you won't even be able to buy it. Thinking of this, he couldn't help but feel elated. The psychology of greed for small gains was immediately fully revealed. He immediately cut off the coupon, took two dollars, and ran to the post office to remit money to Shanghai. On the way back, he planned in his mind that he would be able to listen to the elegant music of famous actors in a week?</p>
<p>A week passed, but the "Love Listening Gramophone" was still silent and did not come gracefully. Only on this evening did he receive a "proof of trial coupon" book sent by XX Foreign Firm. He opened it and saw that it was written on it: "This is a proof of trial coupon. Each book has eight pages. You can tear it off and give it to your eight relatives and friends. After your relatives and friends have all held the coupon and attached two dollars each, and then asked this firm for this kind of trial coupon, you can give you a Love Listening brand gramophone, record." After he finished reading, he shouted, "Bad luck, bad luck, I've been deceived again."</p>

<h3 id="e225">A General Overview of the American Automobile Business in the Last Six Months by Mo-Ya <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>▲ Shanghai's Situation is the Opposite, Everyone is Optimistic</p>
<p>The American automobile trade in the first six months of this year has achieved the lowest results in recent years. However, the situation in Shanghai is exactly the opposite, and automobile dealers are generally very optimistic. Their business conditions are mostly good or satisfactory. The new 1932 models they handle have different lengths of time on the market, but after the Shanghai Battle in February of this year, before the quiet July and August, their business was very strong. Compared with last year, automobile sales in Shanghai have made great progress this year. Although detailed figures are not available at present, according to dealers, except for one exception, all are more profitable than in 1931. This year's new models have many reforms, and British-made cars have also been greatly improved. With both the United States and the United Kingdom making improvements, major automobile dealerships in Shanghai have benefited, and their total sales have increased significantly. In addition, there are also those who attract customers with the lowest-priced cars, which was also not seen last year.</p>
<p>According to automobile dealers in this city, those who had new 1932 models in hand in January of this year achieved excellent business results. At that time, there were few competing varieties, and their strong competitors were slow to arrive, which greatly increased the value of their cars. Therefore, business in the new year increased rapidly, with a sudden surge in momentum. Unfortunately, the Shanghai Battle broke out, and the beautiful hopes were shattered. However, some dealers took this opportunity to sell off old stock and outdated cars that no one cared about. The automobile trade in February, except for military use, came to a complete standstill. In March, after the end of the war, business was extremely sluggish, but it improved slightly at the end of the month, because most Shanghai residents who wanted to buy cars were waiting and watching.</p>
<p>Business in April jumped up, which was a post-war reaction. This upward trend continued until May and June. Sales in June were slightly sluggish, and July was also weak. In August, the automobile business in Shanghai showed a strong trend of recovery, and dealers were encouraged. They were optimistic about the next few months. At that time, there were also some dealers of European cars who, although the cars they represented did not have the special advantages of American-made cars, still had a considerable advantage. This was due to the economy of use, fuel efficiency, and the patriotic enthusiasm of buyers who bought cars made in their own country. For these reasons, cars made in countries other than the United States and mainland China sold well in Shanghai. During this period, the situation in the United States was the opposite of Shanghai. This half-year was the worst period for the automobile business in a long time. In the first six months of this year, the total number of automobile registrations, excluding the state of Georgia, was 655,764 vehicles. This number is still far from the most conservative estimate at the end of 1931. The production of Ford factories was suspended for four months, which experts say was the main reason for the reduction in sales, but it was not the biggest reason for the drop in production. The main reason for the decline was due to the economic recession. To understand the decline in passenger cars in the United States, it is best to compare it with the production volume in 1931. In the first six months of last year, the number of automobile registrations was 1,161,689 vehicles. Comparing the first half of 1932 and 1931, the difference is 505,925 vehicles, a drop of 43.5%.</p>
<p>According to the official statistics received in Shanghai, the number of Chevrolet cars in the first half of 1932 was the highest, with 215,811 vehicles. Chevrolet sales accounted for 32.9% of the total, exceeding Ford, which ranked second, with a quantity of 103,000 vehicles. Ford's percentage was 17.2. Plymouth, known for its floating power, had a total quantity of 62,429 vehicles, accounting for 9.5% of the total. The next ten were Buick, Pontiac, Dodge, Chrysler, Studebaker, DeSoto, and Willys-Overland. General Motors Corporation still ranked first in terms of the largest number of classifications, with a total of 307,016 vehicles in six models. Chrysler Motors ranked second, with a quantity of 116,075 vehicles (exceeding 13,554 vehicles last year, ranking third). Ford Lincoln ranked third, with a total of 114,475 vehicles. Studebaker, Pierce-Arrow, and Rockne ranked fourth (ranking sixth last year), with 27,656 registrations. The same period last year was 30,388 vehicles. Except for Chrysler, this category accounted for a higher percentage in 1931. The total number of other categories is as follows: Hudson-Essex 21,841 vehicles; Willys-Overland 16,528 vehicles; Auburn Cord 7,106 vehicles.</p>
<p>If we compare the number of registrations of individual vehicles, then Plymouth and DeSoto were the most numerous in the first half of this year. Therefore, in fact, Chrysler was the only category that grew, with an excess of 42,657 vehicles. DeSoto increased by 1,382 vehicles. The number of registrations in June was 47,537 vehicles, an increase of 13.6% compared to May, but a decrease of 26.1% compared to June 1931. This was the best month of the year, due to the increase in Ford production by 29,595 vehicles compared to May. If we count the entire industry, there was only an increase of 17,696 vehicles. The number of Ford registrations in June was 52,795 vehicles, the most among all kinds of cars. Except for the states of Arkansas, Maryland, Mississippi, Montana, and the Dakotas, Ford ranked first in all states. In the above-mentioned states, Chevrolet had a slight advantage. The percentage of Ford's total in June was 35.8, while Chevrolet was 24.9. In May, Ford accounted for 17.9% of the total, while Chevrolet accounted for 30%. This reversal was entirely due to the launch of the Ford V8 car, so June reached its peak. Chevrolet had the most in April, with 44,880 vehicles.</p>
<p>The number of Plymouth registrations in June was 16,618 vehicles (accounting for 11.3% of the total). It ranked third in the United States and various states (except for Georgia, which is unknown). Pontiac had 5,026 vehicles (accounting for 3.4% of the total). It ranked fourth in the country. Others only ranked fourth in 22 states. The other cars that ranked fourth in various states included Buick in 16 states, Dodge and Rockne in 3 states each, Nash and DeSoto in 2 states each, and Auburn and Essex in 1 state each. This is the list after the top ten. Outside of Ford, there were only two types that increased from May to June. One was Auburn, which increased by 1,500 vehicles, accounting for 21.5%. The second was Willys-Overland, which increased by about 22%. Ford's increase of 29,600 vehicles compared to May accounted for about 127.2%. Plymouth was the only car that increased in June of this year compared to last year, with an increase of 12,750 vehicles, accounting for about 330%. The number of registrations in June increased in 34 states, including the District of Columbia. Pennsylvania increased by 3,100, California 2,700, Michigan 2,400, New Jersey 3,000, Ohio and Texas 1,100. Although New York was still the leader among the states, the number of registrations was 340 less than in May. Illinois was 101 less. Other states that fell included Kansas, Minnesota, North Carolina, and Tennessee. The number of automobile registrations in Michigan, Oklahoma, Washington, and Washington each increased in June compared to the same period last year. However, the total increase in these four states was only about 1,500 vehicles.</p>
