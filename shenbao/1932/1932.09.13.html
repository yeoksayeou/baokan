<h3 id="c1">日本進行兩手續 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>元·</p>
<p>據今日東京電訊。日政府已决於星期四日正式宣布承認僞國矣。并於同時進行兩種手續。</p>
<p>一對承認事發聲明書。登記於國際聯盟事務局。使其承認得爲訂約國間所確認。</p>
<p>二對國聯調查報告。提出意見書。將東北問題作一聲叙。已電請國聯展緩李頓報告書之討論。</p>
<p>此兩種進行活動。已足見日政府對東北滿洲問題。决心無絲毫讓步餘地。其一承認僞滿洲之登記聲明書。雖其國内。尚有恐國聯容喙而主張鄭重者。然日本旣已首先承認。自必欲使訂約國羣起附從。而後始達其目的。故其進行登記。當爲日一必取之手續。但國聯爲自身公平之立塲着想。爲世界和平之前途着想此傀儡之滿洲僞國。能承認其爲一新國家乎。承認之後。能不發生絶大之糾紛乎。此爲國聯亟應予以極嚴重之考慮。其二日本發表對調查報告之意見書。用意不過恐調查報告於已不利。急圖推翻。吾人誠未知調查之結果。究竟何如。惟調查諸團員。負莊嚴偉大之使命。費半載勤勞之工作。國聯諸國。旣深加信賴而重託之則今後開會討論。自惟以諸團員之報告爲根據。豈容當事之日本參加意見。今日本旣毅然請求展緩討論。以待其意見書之至。則我國爲預防日本之欺蒙國聯計。亦當謀所以切實對付方策。向國聯有所聲明。此爲我國外交當局所亟應加以嚴重之考慮。</p>
<h3 id="c2">人格敎育 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>翰·</p>
<p>敎育之意義。不僅止於智識之灌輸。亦且及於品性之陶冶。舉凡身心之修養。手腦之發展。皆須兼而顧之。務使人人養成健全之人格。具有優秀分子之條件。各盡所能。各抒其才。爲社會服務。爲民族造福。則敎育之爲用始顯。惟今之所謂敎育。其所表現者。似離敎育之意義。未免太遠。蓋近年以來。敎育界中往往有一部分人。將敎育之意義及其對於社會之使命。完全抛諸腦後。且於私行爲毫不約束檢點。反假託主義。巧立名詞。藉以隱蔽其罪惡。與學生之觀感以極惡劣之印象。其影響之鉅。且波及全社會。而民族風氣之墮落。亦即肇端於斯。近來社會上錯雜離奇之作姦犯科。以及其他駭人聽聞之行爲。層見疊出。類多從智識階級中發現。好辯者且認爲新舊社會過渡中之必然現象。吾竊以優秀分子而甘作「必然現象」中之「被支配者。」深爲敎育界羞。　　近世社會學者。以有機體譬社會以社會之發展。完全恃乎社會細胞之健全。苟細胞而入於畸形狀態。則有機體亦將入於病態。敎育之目的。正欲使社會份子。個個成爲健全之細胞。然後可以促進整個社會之進步。是則從事敎育事業者之本身。即須先具備健全之人格。方能以身作則。引學生於光明之坦道。若敎育者本身之人格。先有極大之缺憾。而欲學生養成健全之人格。其可得乎。况據近世犯罪學者之研究。犯罪爲社會之畸形事實。足以構成社會之病態。而斯種種畸形事實。多爲「畸形人」所造成。畸形人之分析。亦甚繁複。有生理上之畸形。有心理上之畸形。若在智識方面有偏面之發展。而於倫理方面放僻邪侈。無所不爲。則嚴格而論。亦當以「畸形人」目之。以此種「畸形人」而竟囚首垢面。好爲人師。則敎育前途。尚堪設想乎。</p>
<p>人或斥吾言爲頑固爲詭辯爲曲解者。則請以西洋之高等敎育爲證。英之牛津與劍橋。德之古丁鏗與海德堡。比之魯文。其堂堂學府。往往位置於山林僻壤間。使莘莘學子。日游息於清靜幽雅之園地。聲色旣不及亂其耳目。身心自歸於純潔。且早夕相接觸者。多爲德高望重之名儒。其學識之淵博。猶其餘事。而人格之高尚。則尤爲社會所欽佩。前年比國首都大學敎授某以有婦之夫而與學生戀愛。與論大譁。卒受學校撤職之處分。比京大爲自由主義者之學府。學生亦類皆崇尚自由思想者。獨於斯舉。莫不對學校表同情。可見西洋學府之重視人格敎育。有足多者。然則吾國之爲人師者。亦可有以自處矣。</p>

<p>上海草地網球會之公開雙打比賽、林寳華邱飛海昨對馬塞爾與　柯拉沙　在中華網球塲舉行初賽、結果林邱以直落三勝、今日下午三時三十分林邱與卡那凡洛江道章在中華會作第二週賽、卡那凡洛爲上海雙打聖手、機敏過人、江道章威風猶在、今日定予林邱以劇烈競爭焉、門票六角、由馬浪路入、昨日成績如下、</p>
<p>邱飛海林寳華七比五六比一六比四曰柯拉沙馬塞爾</p>
<p>昨日况爭形勢、殊爲鬆懈、故無精彩可言、惟葡選手穩健非凡、每奏奇功、林邱配搭、未臻緊凑、空隙甚多、屢爲敵人所襲、第一盤柯馬組屢佔優先、當以五比四勝時、天忽下雨、暫行停賽者約五分鐘、當雨止繼續比賽時、地上濕滑不堪、不利奔跑、但林邱卒以七比五奪回第一盤並又以六比一取次盤、第三盤柯馬二人曾以四比二局佔上風、卒被林邱連加四局而終、</p>

<p>衆望所屬之東華足球隊、由熱心斯道之盛蘋臣君、協同新請幹事陳錦江君銳意改組、並請西人李思廉君担任指導、廣羅人才、力圖宏展、詳情已迭誌本報該隊已約英國駐滬陸軍、蜚聲海上足球界之林肯艦隊、在中華棒球場作第一次正式演習戰、</p>
<p>林肯隊去冬曾接代諾森堡陸軍出席西人足球會之比賽、在甲組中名居首席、並在史高托杯中與東華西捕等同得複賽權、該隊球藝、夙爲球迷賞識、埠際隊中、亦有四五人爲正式隊員、故實力之强、有獨步申江之勢、</p>
<p>東華今日出場人物守門周賢言因尚未到滬、今由陸鍾恩充任、當不致减色、前衛内衛、鞏固非凡、所缺僅前鋒之戴麟經李義臣、今由歐陽永源陳虞添爲輔、陳洪光任中鋒、錢敬鏞奚巧生分任兩翼、仍極猛銳、馮運佑原屬曁南球員、今已正式入東華會爲會員、亦東華一可喜之事也、</p>
<p>東華隊全體球員、均散佈於夏令賽之各隊中、幾經出塲、體力並有充分修養、林肯隊尚屬初次出塲、故今日之戰、東華必有精彩成績度預料海上球迷、與東華久别乍逢、將羣趨中華棒球塲、大飽眼福也、</p>

<h3 id="c102">姓鄭的刺客 <a href="#c102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>一位姓鄭的刺客說：吾爲天下殺此賊，死且不恨。這位刺客，便是鄭虎臣，生在宋朝：他曾經殺死賈似道在漳州木棉庵，這是已往歷史上值得紀念的事。</p>
<p>又有一位姓鄭的刺客說：他自來送死，余冒險擊殺之：一爲黨國增光，二爲革命增榮，三爲山東除害，四爲叔父報仇：今幸大仇已報，余生死早置度外。這位刺客便是鄭繼成，生在現代，他最近殺死張宗昌在濟南車站，這是現代歷史上值得紀念的事。</p>
<p>兩位刺客發表的話，都是不惜一身而替生民除害，多麽慷慨激昻啊，在迷信因果者聽了，或者要疑及現代的鄭繼成便是宋朝鄭虎臣轉世。然而張宗昌的爲惡資格，究竟夠不上賈信道：似道非但誤國，而且賣國：宗昌是一個倒行逆施的軍閥，居然也理會得賣國不是生意經，不肯頂着他老祖宗張邦昌的牌號，這個人還有一隙之明，一死以後，大部分的人稱快，小部分的人還替他嗟嘆什麽？嗟嘆他覺悟已遲了。鄭虎臣殺了賈似道，本人也死於法律：鄭繼成殺了張宗昌，不知能邀寛免否？漳州木棉庵地方，後人立着石碣，上刋宋鄭虎臣誅賈似道於此。一根據閩中撫聞丨濟南車站附近，不知可有人立着石碣上書民國二一年鄭繼成誅張宗昌於此？這都是未來的事，不須預測，只好拭目以俟吧？</p>

<p>— 洪·流·</p>
<p>英儒斯賓塞爾說：「傳敎士一手執着聖經，很慈祥的告訴我們：「我們要博愛，當别人來打我們左臉時，我們還要將右臉轉過去承受：抵抗是野蠻，報復是罪惡！我們要馴伏，要像綿羊般的馴伏，上帝會結你永恒的快樂！」但是，當他的國家和别一國打仗時，他又會怒目切齒，告訴我們：「我們要起來！拿我們的槍口，瞄準了我們的敵人！我們要拿鐵和血去博得我們最後的勝利！」許多人以爲這是十分矛盾的事體，其實，這是很合邏輯的：他呌我們博愛，是爲了人類生存，他呌我們和敵人拼命，也是爲了人類生存：在世界中，這是一樣的需要。」</p>
<p>所以，我們歐西的文明人，一個傳敎士走到那裏，，跟着便是一只兇得怕人的兵艦，威風凛凛的開來了，這本是非常合理的。我們就不然。講道德向來是没有界限，他呌你待人處世，要寛厚忍耐，當一個强盜，手警着鋼刀，架在你頸上時，他還是呌你要寛厚忍耐。要是動一動，我們文明的歐西人，便會駡你野蠻，駡你是半開化的人，你們别說張將軍的不抵抗主義，是千古奇聞，那到是世界上最文明的一種行徑哪！</p>

<p>對於先死者，固然有「頭可斷，志不可屈」的精神，但在後死者，責任更重要，工作更艱苦，更不能辜負先死者托孤的義務。</p>
<p>我們要做後死者，必須具有以下的目標：　　第一·我們要認清敵人，不受其利用，不受其引誘，「一心一德」本着良心做去。</p>
<p>第二·我們要接濟先死者，鼓勵先死者，安慰先死者，使他們安心殺敵。</p>
<p>第三·我們不要貪懶，不要自私，不要自已閙事，加緊我們應盡的義務，</p>
<p>同胞！敵人的旗幟，不是還在東北飄揚嗎？東北義勇軍反抗的聲浪，不是一天一天的在延長嗎？我是先死者，我是後死者，隨着自已的意向，快快的幹去！同胞！努力！努力！</p>

<p>「王先生，你假使是立刻到會場上去，也許會遇見張醫生，那麽請你通知他一聲，散會了以後，務必請他到這裏來，給伊注射一次，王先生，勞你的駕！」芬若說着，便開了門很客氣的送王先生出去，而實際上，這幾句話，等於是下逐客令，王先生也覺得無可再逗留了。　　但是王先生出了芬若的門，十分悵惘，滿腹的狐疑，他在想怎的從未聽得伊們說過與袁團長有什麽關係，袁團長在戰事之前，和戰事之後，從未到過？不錯，袁瘋子是袁，團長也是姓袁，而瘋子在發瘋的時候，曾說過袁團長是伊的丈夫，難道這話是眞確的麽？旣然是夫婦，袁團長怎麽把伊丢在這裏毫不聞問呢？假使是眞確的，芬若一定和袁家有多少的密切關係無疑了。芬若是一個孀婦，也許和袁團長有什麽曖昧吧？那才使我失望了，像我這麽一個窮商人，怎樣可以和富而且貴的團長比得上呢？但是，芬若要是眞與團長有曖昧的話，何致還窮苦到這樣？要是没有曖昧的話，現在何以又立刻要把我　出，而且芬若很有驚惶失措的樣子，這敎人很可生疑的了·</p>
<p>王先生越想越妒袁團長，並且怨恨着尤芬若，他在打主意，想把這秘密揭布到會塲上去，至少也可以把團長的名譽和威儀，使它掃地。但是他再一想，却又膽怯，他自已和自已商量，他是軍人，無論如何敵不過他，他要蠻幹，拔出手槍來，我是一個犧牲品：他要文幹，借一個緣由，把我抓了去，說我是共産黨定了死罪，我也無從伸寃，反正是不能得罪他。</p>
<p>他慢慢地一步步走到家裏，而並不走到會場，他很傷心，很憤慨，很懊惱，却不敢下一個决心。</p>

<p>報告内政外交各問題</p>
<p>中央社云、林主席在滬、昨晨未外出、九時許、接見吳市長及舊友外、又於近午、接見各通訊社記者、對於日來國人所注意之各項内政外交問題、有所報告、下午一時許、復外出訪友、至晚尚未歸寓、兹將林主席所談各點、分誌於左、</p>
<p>汪即晋京　林主席謂、本人日前已與汪院長晤及、縱談甚歡、汪先生病勢已減、惟熱度尚未退盡、全愈後當即返京、但現尚無定期、汪先生素負責任、在此國家多難之時、决不稍露消極態度、　　勸陳銷假　交通部長陳銘樞、前晨曾來訪本人、當以陳氏請假、業已期滿、故勸其即日返京視事、記者旋問主席、勸陳返京、是否另有其他重要任務、請其負責、林主席答、陳氏前曾向中央請辭部務、但未予允准、故陳氏返京、當然仍在交通部長、惟陳氏尚未表示可否、</p>
<p>改組閩省　關於閩省改組事、林主席語記者、本人未聞此事、且中央尚無此議、祇見日來報紙上有此紀載而已、惟閩省人民、確曾向政府請願改組閩省、本人亦甚望政府能積極整頓、使閩省政治得上軌道、</p>
<p>三中會期　三中全會、已决將展期、蓋當此秋高馬肥之際、正國家用兵之時、政府現正積極勦匪、蔣委員長等各中委、均將兵在外、如馳回出席、恐於軍事上有重大影響、且以前歷　全會、亦有展延至三月或半年者、</p>
<p>對日外交　記者旋又以昨日報載、有我駐日蔣公使奉命訪日陸相及外相、曾提出所謂折衷辦法、是否確實、林主席答、此係外交問題、可詢之外交部當局、惟此係路透之電訊、或有不可完全置信之處、希望各位勿輕予信任也、</p>
<p>國民參政　關於國民參政之進行、林主席謂、該項條例草案、已由汪精衛先生等起擬、刻尚在縝密審核中、因此項條例、關係於國民之選舉、政府當取鄭重之態度、以免各省爲競爭選舉而發生誤會云、</p>
<p>收復失地　收復東北失地、本人認爲政府應做之事、而國民當亦熱切盼望政府能公布具體計劃、更能希望政府、能循序進行、以達目的、惟此項計劃、非但因事關軍事、不能公布、且關係國際間至鉅、故政府雖有所定奪、當不能爲安慰國民輕於公布、而引起意外之糾紛、至於下令討伐叛逆、原係一紙命令、旦夕可下、惟一切準備、究非易易、但政府當積極準備、不畏艱難、以達此目的也、</p>
<p>孫即北上　孫哲生先生、本月二十三日即可抵滬、本人希望孫先生亦即晋京、共襄國事、胡展堂先生病已漸愈、伍梯雲先生是否與孫哲生同行來滬、不得而知、</p>

<p>俟執委會通過後再行函復</p>
<p>廢兩改元問題、自中央銀行陳副總裁以研究委員會主席名義、提出應研究者三點、一新銀幣之重量及成色、二尚在有效期間之銀兩契約、其與銀幣折合之比率、如何規定、三應採取何種辦法、可使一般人對於此項變更瞭解而信仰、分函市商會及各團體、徵集意見後、市商會即遍函各同業公會及各地商會、廣徵意見、並組織研究廢兩改元問題委員會、就幣制原理國内商情、及各方答復、詳加研究、經幾次開會之結果、於昨日召集末次委員會、經議决各項意見如下、</p>
<p>第一問題　新幣之重量及銀色、應以不背下列四項原則爲標準、决定其重量成色、所謂四項原則者、一貨幣成色過高則易於私自鎔燬、成色過低、則易於誘起私鑄、證諸貨幣之先例、非一决定重量成色之時、宜防止此兩項弊端之發生、二主幣係無限法償、與輔幣之有限法償不同、故輔幣可以名價高於實價、而主幣則名價與實價不能相遠、三政府鑄幣、在現時狀况之下、固不能使其賠本、然亦不可希冀盈餘、因一有盈餘、則硬幣亦可如軟幣之濫發、引起通貨澎漲物價騰貴之結果、吾國貨幣史上、此等先例、已歷歷可數、四裁制之變更整理、應於可能範圍内、使社會經濟狀况、不致有劇烈變動、　　第二問題　尚在有效期間之銀兩契約、俟廢兩改元實行後、彼時履行債務者、自必改付新國幣、則以新國幣之新價值爲換算比率、最爲公允、因廢兩之後、旣無所謂洋厘市價、捨此國幣實價以外、固别無可以折算之標準也、</p>
<p>第三問題　欲使社會瞭解而信任、一應使社會用銀元、較之用銀兩更爲便利、至少亦有與銀兩有同樣之便利、其條件、（甲）爲鑄造自由、凡持有舊幣或元寳或條銀者、國家造幣廠能隨時應其要求、比照公布之換算率、付以數額相等之新國幣、（乙）爲運輸自由、凡從前禁止運現出境、限制運現出境之禁令、不宜由地方當局輕予頒布、應改由中央銀行、負有調劑金融之責者、隨時察酌、妥愼辦理、二應使社會視銀元如銀兩、有同樣之準確成色、不致有劣幣與輕幣之恐怖觀念、擾攘於胸中、其條件、爲（子）將舊幣隨時收回改鑄、（丑）集中造幣權、非但中央所設之杭廠固應廢止外、如川省軍人私設之銀元局、廣州所設之造幣廠、尤應以嚴令勒停不可、以爲一則鞭長莫及、一則僅鑄毫洋而忽之、（寅）組織幣制監察委員會、就全國之商業團體、及金融界中、推選若干人、輪班駐滬、分司監察、其任務爲一參與硬幣之化騐、以其成色隨時公告、且滬地化騐之後、如重要都市、亦可由商業團體自設化騐部、隨時化騐、以資比較、而便徵信、二參與軟幣之公開檢查、以其準備成數、隨時公告、蓋本條要旨、以監察幣制之任務、公之全國、並不以設於滬上、而獨由滬人負其專責、以大公無我之態度、喚起全國之信仰、庶新幣制易於推行、</p>
<p>上項意見、當由委員會函送常務委員會提交執行委員會通過後、再行正式函復云、</p>

<p>去年創立　該行創立於去歲三月間、股本實收五十萬元、總經理爲黄明道、經理唐海珊、經營銀行一切業務、創立伊始、一時生意鼎盛、去年上半年四個月間、盈餘約六萬元之譜、</p>
<p>清理原因　該行除經營押欵等等外、並營大批公債、九一八東省事變以後、債價隨之跌落、迨一二八滬戰再起、該行所有股東、十之四五、虧於公債、原望價有起色、終因時局不寗、彌補乏術、本年八月二十七日、雖經董事會議决、續招新股、又因種種關係、而不能實現、該行所收儲蓄存欵、僅計七萬元左右、至債權方面、如放欵押欵等等則有二十萬元左右、該行全體股東、爲免除鉅大損失、遂忍痛於本月十一日開會、决議停止營業、結束清理、</p>
<p>社會安定　國聞社記者、以大達銀行清理、恐有影響社會經濟、特往訪銀行界某要人、據談、大達銀行、原非銀行同業公會會員、該行因經營不善、及受公債跌落關係、遂告停業、聞内部之儲蓄部份、存欵照數付還、因爲數不鉅、故社會上並不發生任何影響云云、</p>

<p>黄明道病　記者昨驅車赴該行總經理黄明道寓次、因黄氏肺病甚疾、不能見客、據其家人談、黄於去年九一八後、因病迄未到行視事、故現下對行事甚爲隔膜云云、</p>
<p>會計師談　辦理此案之謝霖會計師發表談話云、該行資本五十萬元、係股份有限公司、已在實業部登記、領有執照、上年開業以來、營業甚佳、旋值九一八及滬戰之影響、所買公債較多、以致受損不資、勉强支持至今、不特股本虧耗凈盡、且有過之、昨日股東開會、認爲無法繼續營業、遂經議决解散、並選任本會計師及裘汾齡律師爲清算人、現正接收賬據、定於本月十九日起、登記該行債務、一面催收放欵、以資攤派、惟儲蓄部存欵、原係呈准財政部獨立辦理、且按儲蓄銀行則例董事經理、均須担負無限責任、業由董事墊定欵項、委託本會計師、自十三日起、在本事務所照付、爲數約七萬元之譜、業有通告、明日登報云、</p>

<p>本市工廠檢查、自經市社會局於九月一日起、開始實行後、各業因戰後工商業凋敝、紛請展緩、該局已定期召集各團體詳爲解釋、兹誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>通知各業　社會局昨通知本市各工商業團體云、爲通知事、本局此次實施初期工廠檢查、依法應予檢查事項、各廠殊多誤會、以致紛請展緩、爲此特定於九月十四十五日下午二時、邀集各工商業團體、詳爲解釋、以釋疑慮、届時務希貴會推派代表二人或一人、准時到局、聽候談話、特此通知、中華民國二十一年九月十二日、局長吳醒亞、</p>
<p>談話日程　十四日下午二時、爲上海國貨工廠聯合會·機製國貨工廠聯合會·中華工業聯合會·上海市商會華商紗廠聯合會·以上每廠推派代表二人、十五日下午二時、爲華商皂業公會·中國呢羢工廠公會·針織業公會·餅乾糖果罐頭業公會·電機絲織廠公會·蛋廠業公會·絲廠業公會·華商捲烟業公會·絲光棉織業公會·銅鐵機器業公會·麫粉業公會·化妝品業公會·火機軋花業公會·印鐵製罐業公會·精鍊業公會·國貨橡膠製品業公會·搪瓷業公會·以上每會推派代表一人、地點爲小南門社會局、</p>
<p>解釋疑點　社會局實施初期工廠檢查、首先檢查者、爲滬南區、昨據該局發表云、工廠法是國家法律的一種、歐美各國都早已實行了、首先實行工廠法的國家、便是工業最早發達的英國、工廠法的意義、是在免除工人因工廠生活而發生的弊害、所以工人年齡工作時間、工資給付、童工女工的限制、和工廠的安全設備與衛生設備等等、都是工廠法範圍内所規定的事項、應當逐步實行的、工廠法的意義、固然是爲免除工人因工廠生活而發生的弊害、但是工廠方面、切不可誤會這種法是工廠的仇敵、是專爲保護工人、增加工人抗爭力的東西、因爲工廠法的本旨、原來是想保持勞資的和平、消弭階級鬥爭、使得資本可以合理的發達、所以工廠法的目的、與其說是專爲保護工人的利益、毋寗說是保護全社會人民的利益、工廠說旣是以保護全社會人民的利益爲目的、那麽這個法、必須到完全實行之後、才可以收保護的實效、否則還不過是等於一種裝飾品罷了、但是講到這種法令實行的時候、並不是只要把法令公布了、便可以實行的、一定要有專設的人員、負責督促、才可以謀法令的實現、所以各國都有工廠監督的制度、中國也有工廠檢查員的設置、中國工廠檢查員的設置、是根據於工廠檢查法、</p>

<p>科學炭精製造法  天·覽　　在電的潮流中、炭精一物，用途最佔需要，吾國年向國外購辦，流出金錢，亦復可觀，且市上銷售的炭精，某國貨居多，苟不從事製造，此項漏巵，將何以杜塞呢。　　普通的炭精製法，極其簡單，只要稍具一點學識，即可依法製造，而且本輕利重，有一二千金的小資本，就能創辦一家小小的炭精廠了。　　炭精的主要原料，是一種焦炭屑，西名Coke和麵粉，糖水，清水，四樣東西而已，這四樣東西，價錢都不昻貴，所以製成了炭精，賺錢是穩操左劵的。　　製時，選純凈的焦炭屑，用杵臼搗成極細的末，密篩篩過，加入乾麵粉八分之一或六分之一，互相　匀，調下適宜的淡糖水，封存二三小時，不使水氣飛散，至炭粉潤透後，即用模製成炭片炭條。　　乃將此炭片炭條，移置爐上，用暗火炕之，使其漸乾，並不時增加熱度，一俟乾透，放在鐵箱内，上面覆一層焦炭屑末，防露置在空氣中，自然焚燒。　　於是移於凉處，俟其凉透，取出，另加糖汁，和水煑三十分鐘，再照前法炙乾，如是燒煉二三次後，片條均已堅實，成爲合用的炭精了，不過較機器製造的，稍微遜一籌而已。改良社會討論會我對於早婚的觀察  阿·彥　　丨早婚是有害的嗎？　　增刋先後發表了浣花與文炳兩君關於早婚的文章，浣花君着重在說明早婚的流弊：文炳君則在剖析早婚的成因及其補救方法。我個人與他們兩君的意思並不盡同，我認爲目前中國的確有早婚的事實存在，但所謂早婚，在現在已不能成爲問題。早婚在某種關係上多少要發生流弊，但也是相對的而非絶對的。　　文炳君對於早婚成因的觀察很清楚，我的意思大致和他相同。中國早婚現象的發生，第一，即是基於封建社會遺留的家族制度。第二，早婚普遍的現象，大都發生在自給自足的農業社會及謀生比較容易的時代。　　不過因潮流的推移，這些解釋已不能應用到晚近。家族組織雖然還在掙扎着，但這些組織已將爲新的洪流所冲毁。在廣大的農村社會裏除了極少數的地主富農以外，大多數都在破産流離中生活，自顧無暇，當然談不到早婚。同樣，在都市中，中上階級儘有早婚的能力，但因爲他們的兒子受了摩登敎育，醉心所謂自由戀愛。父母的支配婚姻權早已喪失。都市無産者生活不安定，也没有早婚的可能。這樣，那怕目前還有部份的例外的早婚事實存在，但早婚現象已在日漸没落中，所謂早婚，已不能成爲問題的了。　　客觀環境旣竟减少了中國民衆的早婚事實。但我們不能否認窮鄉僻市還有早婚的事實的發生丨尤其是農民中小農以上的社會層裏。這裏我們不妨討論一下早婚的本身究竟有没有流弊，流弊的程度又怎樣？　　一般人以爲早婚在體質上是最大的損失，其實也是不盡然的，主要的應該看當事人發育的程度如何而决定。有些人以爲早婚反可以補救青年的手淫問題，從十五歲以上的男女青年丨特别是男性。多數犯了這種非法的毛病。（江蘇鎭中檢查宿舍結果，被上有精跡者達百分之七十以上）與其非法洩精，假如環境允許，不如早婚。　　其次，有些人顧慮到早婚後的經濟問題。這在我看來也是不成問題的，因爲根本上早婚的發生，要取决於他本人的經濟環境。如其經濟環境允許，什麽都不會成問題，有經濟生育之慮的人，就没有發生早婚的可能。在小農和中農家庭内，他們以爲替子弟早婚，不但没有經濟之慮，反而可以因此得到無須工錢的勞動者，娶一個媳婦，即將增加他一份生産。　　所以我的結論是：　　早婚現象是隨着社會的變革而盛衰的，在日前早婚已逐漸在减少，以後所謂早婚已不復成爲問題。我們不必肯定說早婚不好，但也不必提倡早婚，今後的兩性結合，儘可任其自然。爲什麽愛之奴隸  吾　　妻每天都一樣，吃了午飯便照例的上醫院去探望她的摯友素馨，而素馨亦是每天午飯後便眼巴巴的等候着妻的到臨。很明白的，她們中間已被一種嚴肅的友情牢牢的縈繫着而加厚生活的興味。　　可是今天妻却帶着極重的憂愁回來，這使我十分驚奇，於是我低聲的詢問她，她說：　　「哎！我想做一個女人眞是無味，像素馨這樣的有什麽意義呢？　　今天我走近她的床邊的時候，她正和她那十四歲的小妹妹在眼淚汪汪的談話，當然我猛然覺着她們中間一定有了重大的不幸，然而我只得默默的坐下，爲的是要以寗靜的態度來設法安慰她。果然，當她妹妹走後，她便緊執着我的雙手，眼淚簌簌的落下來。　　「你可知道，世界上眞没有比我再苦命的人了。」她哭訴着說：「剛才小妹妹告訴我說：我的丈夫居然和一個我不認識的女人在我家裏住了兩晚了，而且把我的一件新做不久的旗袍也送給了她。」　　這時候她的喉頭似乎已給一塊石頭塞住了，再也吐不出話來。於是我連忙接着安慰她說：　　「素馨！别發急罷，爲了你可愛的孩子，爲了你産後的身體，你達觀一點兒罷。同時這也許是你丈夫一時的錯誤，以後他一定會從新改變過來的。」　　其後她仍然嗚咽的繼續着說：　　「不，你把他估量得太高了，他一定不會悔悮的。你完全知道他。你知道我和他結婚已經四年了，三年來他完全没有照料過家庭裏的事情，雖然老是在家裏閒着。當然，爲了生活，我得繼續當我的小學敎師，維持我，維持家庭，而且還維持他吃烟打牌。固然，我並不如一般女子希望因此能要求丈夫對自已的感激，不過，我從來没有想到過：當我坐褥的時候，他却忍心去另外結交女人，而且發生肉慾關係。這對於我眞是極其兇猛的打擊了。」　　「可是，」我說：「你應當這樣想：我們可以給與他一個機會，因爲有些男人有些時候是會幹些自已所不想幹的事業的。你能這樣以純眞的愛情去感化他，即使他是鐵打的心腸，總有一天會對你感泣的。」　　其後她又說：　　「他什麽事都不願意幹，簡直懶得要命，假使我不做事他便得餓死。當然，我絶對不願依賴丈夫生活，只要我還有一線生機。然而我辛辛苦苦賺來的一點很少的錢，假如他能很節省的用到也没有什麽，可是他每天不是玩大世界，便是帶許多人到家裏來打牌，於是我敎了書回來還得累得要命的給他們燒飯吃。同時他以先還有一個老婆的，現在還是常常來往，怪肉麻的八妹八妹的呌着。你想我這樣苦痛着是多麽没有意味啊！」　　那末我問：　　「爲什麽他旣有老婆又要和你結婚的？」　　「他們俩離婚了的。」　　「那末爲什麽又還要這樣親切的來往呢？」　　「這祇有天曉得。」　　我們的談話很久，我眞爲她難受。同時她告訴我說：她因生小孩子的緣故，早已向原來的小學辭職，現在又由朋友的介紹，不能滿月便要去ＸＸ報當校對，我想這樣對於産後的身體是多麽不適宜啊，然而又有什麽辦法呢？所以，像她這樣的女人，眞是丈夫的奴隸！」　　妻說完後仍是無限的欷歔，我也默然無語。學堂寫眞女生談考試訣  鈞　　星期日飯後，一句鐘左右，我適在親眷家中，躺在籐椅上，閱報之際，忽聽見咯咯一聲門響，同住者跑至天井中，儂是啥人啥人，際此一手已扶着門閂，（開門者二房東之令嬡羅姓）原來「蜜司脫」梁：長遠不見了，「儂好」：：：「我好」：：：寒暄至客堂中，請坐請坐，一邊請用茶，一邊謝謝儂。　　「蜜司脫」羅：我今天特來請您，同到ＸＸ橋ＸＸ路ＸＸ學校，去報名，你我同在一校讀書好否。　　「梁」說　據說此校設備完美，校長和敎授非常殷勤。　　羅說　「蜜司脫」梁：我是不換學校了，仍在母校讀下去，况此校很嚴厲，故對於進步一方面，很不錯，「不去不去」　　梁說「蜜司脫」羅：您的心與我不同，我因受太嚴厲，此次决遷ＸＸ校去攻書了，但不過開學的難關，終免不掉。　　羅說　「蜜司脫」梁：您旣然遷，當含有比母校美滿之意呀，何以還有難關呢。　　梁說　「蜜司脫」羅：您眞的不知道麽，我不怕羞的敎訴您吧，開學之前一二天，不是要「考試」的麽，考的時候，要做作文，就是試定何級，但是我不會做，做出來不及格，假使退級，父母責問，彼同學譏笑，豈不是難關麽。　　Ｘ說　「蜜司脫」梁：您太不聰敏了，假使明天考試，今天預先寫一封信投校内，只說梁姓ＸＸ病在家裏，不能依貴校章程趨考，「信中祇要如此如此的說」　　梁說「蜜司脫」Ｘ：您好比是現代一個軍人中之參謀·「欽佩欽佩」我早點請敎您，我不患失眠症啦。　　談到此「哈哈哈」拍手大笑。　　突時間梁君掮起手來，眼睜睜注視自已手上，白錁手錶，口中又說，時間將到，「去嘞去嘞」羅君問道（觀電影時間呢，還是約情人時間）梁君一笑說道再會再會，羅姓說不送不送，　幕法院調查員？  影·呆·　　又是一種黑幕　　有一位開醬園的老　，他這次受了Ｘ游戲塲的女茶房拆了一次白，化了幾十塊錢，不算數，那知那位女茶房竟神通廣大，請了律師，告他引誘遺棄之罪，要他賠償三百元的損失，本來上星期開庭的，因爲種種的原因，要等到下星期才對簿公堂。　　那知在前天的午後，突然的有一位西裝少年，坐了一部包車，很神氣的到醬園裏來，據他自已說，是法院調查員，知道老闆和那女茶房打官司，所以特地來調查案情的眞相。而且案情的始末，他都知道底細，說得完全符合的，所以那位閱歷不深，見聞有限的醬園老闆，會很相信他是一個法院調查員呢丨　　據那冒充調查員說，他特地來調查案情，問那老闆下一次開庭的時候，說些什麽口供，老闆毫不隱瞞的一鼓腦兒地說給他聽了，同時他把老闆的口供，記在一本拍紙簿上不過寫的是英文，而不是中文。他並且很誠懇的對老闆說，下次開庭的時候，要同樣的供在法庭上，不可有所不同的。從他的面孔上看去，他似乎也知道老闆是被誣了，表示着十二分的同情，所以隨處有肯帮忙的色彩。　　問過了老闆，那冒充調查員還去盤問老闆的妻子，像煞有假事，好比眞的調查員，誰都會上他的當。調查了足有一個多鐘頭，到了臨走的時候，花樣便來了。　　據他說法院方面，所定的調查費是六元四角，原被告各負一半，所以老闆也須出三元二角的調查費，另外還要加些車錢。　　可憐的那位老闆，他旣不知法院有無調查員，更不知有無調查費，十二分的信任那西裝少年是法院差來的調查員。因爲他的醬園規模不十分大，而且最近又無意中遭了拆白和訴訟，店裏時常没有錢，但調查費不可賒欠，急忙到鄰近的人家，借了三元六角錢，三元二角是調查費，四角是車錢，給了調查員，那冒充調查員才坐了包車，向原路回去。　　後來那老闆問了司法界中的人，才知道法院並無派遣調查員到他那裏，而且根本没有調查費的名種，那老闆不問他要符號和卡片看，未免是太忠實，結果是又受騙了。　　事後我們想來，大概這種騙子，每天在法院中出入的，看見法庭開審的時候，有好欺的原告或被告，便用這種冒充調查員的方法，去騙取金錢，所以案情的始末，什麽都明白，而被騙的人，每是容易受惑。因爲這種還是新騙術，所以寫在這裏，望遭遇訴訟的人們注意！　　啓事　欣奚君鑒，足下通訊地點，乞即示知　因友人有事奉商也，　增刋編輯部啓公佈欄上海第一特區地方法院　　刑事判决　王有才竊盜處有期徒刑八月▲郁陸氏持有鴉片烟具處罰金二百元王計氏持有鴉片處罰金六十元▲▲季阿友竊盜處有期徒刑八月▲夏國文累犯竊盜二罪處二個有期徒刑各三月應執行徒刑四月▲陳阿文傷害人一罪處拘役三十日▲李耀庭毁損處罰金五十元▲李耀庭其餘部分無罪張禮明無罪▲莊世林朱大勝秦俞氏莊萬氏共同竊盜一罪各處有期徒刑一年▲張允洲因賄賂上訴案上訴駁回張允洲緩刑二年▲陸阿二搶奪他人所有物罪犯處有期徒刑一年六月▲李阿寳搶奪他人所有物處有期徒刑六月▲李佩連續竊盜處有期徒刑一年▲黄金生共同搶奪他人所有物未遂累犯處有期徒刑二年▲孔新茂結夥强盜未遂累犯處有期徒刑三年六月崔子香結夥强盜未遂處有期徒刑一年九月▲王金雲訴虞文榮傷害案「主文」虞文榮無罪▲沈陳氏竊盜一罪處有期徒刑二月　　民事批示　益記經租賬房陳奎福具領證物由狀悉照准所有房票四紙仰該聲請人卽日到院具領並將收據帶案繳訖此批▲徐銘烈爲與王洪興欠租案聲請展期拍賣由狀悉查此案疊經展期拍賣均未據該債務人將案欵如數交清顯見意存延宕所請再予展期拍賣之處應不准行仰卽知照此批▲斯文洋行與林昌欠租案聲請執行由狀悉候傳案執行此批▲莊鴻魁與李立夫等貨欵案聲請執行由狀悉候飭傳訊追此批▲永慶莊孫佐卿等與源錩祥貨欵案聲請按額攤償由狀悉候上海第二特區地方法院將拍賣金解到後再予核辦此批▲路俊耀與許桂文等欠欵聲請銷案由狀悉應准銷案此批（以上九月十二日）上海地方法院　　民庭判决　判决倪立懷與王晶齋欠租涉訟一案（主文）被告應賠償原告房租洋一百三十五元▲訴訟費用由被告負担▲判决翟岐祥與王益之因欠租涉訟一案（主文）被告應給付原告房租洋七十八元被告反訴駁回本訴及反訴訴訟費由被告負担▲判决介順行與邵禎祥因借欵涉訟案（主文）被告應償還原告規銀五百兩並自民國十八年國歷五月一

<h3 id="e1">Japan Proceeds with Two Procedures <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>元 ·</p>
<p>According to a Tokyo dispatch today, the Japanese government has decided to formally announce its recognition of the puppet state on Thursday. At the same time, it will carry out two procedures:</p>
<p>1.  Issue a statement regarding the recognition and register it with the League of Nations Secretariat, so that its recognition can be confirmed among the contracting countries.</p>
<p>2.  Submit a written opinion on the League of Nations investigation report, providing a comprehensive account of the Northeast issue. A request has been telegraphed to the League of Nations to postpone the discussion of the Lytton Report.</p>
<p>These two activities are sufficient to demonstrate that the Japanese government has resolved not to concede any ground on the Northeast Manchuria issue. The registration statement for the recognition of the puppet state of Manchuria is undoubtedly a necessary procedure for Japan, even though some within the country are still worried about the League of Nations interfering and advocating for a more cautious approach.  However, Japan has already taken the lead in recognition and will certainly want to encourage all contracting countries to follow suit in order to achieve its goal.  But, for the sake of its own impartial stance and the future of world peace, can the League of Nations recognize this puppet state of Manchuria as a new country? After recognition, will it not lead to major disputes? This is something the League of Nations should seriously consider.  Secondly, Japan is issuing an opinion on the investigation report, intending to overturn any findings that may be detrimental to it. We sincerely do not know what the results of the investigation will be. However, the investigation team members bear a solemn and great mission, have spent half a year working diligently, and the countries of the League of Nations have placed deep trust and responsibility in them. Therefore, future meetings and discussions should be based solely on the report of the team members.  How can Japan, as a party involved, be allowed to participate with its opinions? Now that Japan has resolutely requested a postponement of the discussion to await its opinion, our country, in order to prevent Japan from deceiving the League of Nations, should also devise a practical countermeasure and make a statement to the League of Nations. This is something our diplomatic authorities should seriously consider.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Character Education <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Han ·</p>
<p>The meaning of education is not limited to the imparting of knowledge, but also extends to the cultivation of character. All aspects of physical and mental cultivation, and the development of hands and brains, must be taken into consideration.  It is essential that everyone develop a sound character and possess the qualities of an excellent member of society, each doing their best and contributing their talents to serve society and benefit the nation. Only then will the usefulness of education become apparent. However, what is currently called education seems to be too far removed from the true meaning of education. In recent years, there has often been a portion of people in the education field who have completely abandoned the meaning of education and its mission to society. Moreover, they do not restrain or examine their private behavior, but instead invoke isms and invent terms to conceal their sins, giving students an extremely negative impression. The impact of this is significant, extending to the entire society, and the decline of national morality originates from this.  Recently, bizarre and strange crimes, as well as other shocking acts, have emerged one after another in society, mostly discovered among the intellectual class. Those who like to argue even consider this an inevitable phenomenon in the transition between old and new societies. I secretly believe that an excellent member of society who willingly becomes a "subordinate" in the "inevitable phenomenon" is a shame to the education field.</p>
<p>Modern sociologists compare society to an organism, and the development of society depends entirely on the health of its cells. If the cells enter a deformed state, the organism will also enter a diseased state.  The purpose of education is precisely to make each member of society a healthy cell, so as to promote the progress of the entire society. Therefore, those engaged in education themselves must first possess a sound character in order to lead students on the bright and open path by setting an example. If the educator's own character has major flaws, how can they expect students to develop a sound character? Moreover, according to the research of modern criminologists, crime is a deformed phenomenon in society, sufficient to constitute a societal disease. These various deformed phenomena are mostly caused by "deformed people." The analysis of deformed people is also very complex, including physical deformities and psychological deformities. If there is a one-sided development in the intellectual aspect, while the ethical aspect is licentious and unrestrained, doing everything wrong, then strictly speaking, they should also be regarded as "deformed people." If this kind of "deformed person" is unkempt and eager to be a teacher, how can the future of education be conceivable?</p>
<p>Some may criticize my words as stubborn, sophistical, or a distortion. Then, please take Western higher education as evidence. The prestigious universities of Oxford and Cambridge in England, and Göttingen and Heidelberg in Germany, compared to Leuven, are often located in secluded mountain areas, allowing students to spend their days in quiet and elegant gardens.  Sounds and sights do not distract their ears and eyes, and their minds and bodies naturally return to purity. Moreover, those they come into contact with every day are mostly respected scholars of high virtue. Their profound knowledge is secondary, but their noble character is particularly admired by society. A few years ago, a professor at a university in the Belgian capital was involved in an affair with a student while being a married man, causing a great uproar. He was eventually dismissed by the school. The capital of Belgium is known as a liberal school, and students mostly advocate for liberal thought. However, in this case, they all expressed sympathy for the school. This shows that Western universities value character education, which is commendable. Therefore, those who are teachers in our country can also have a place for themselves.</p>

<p>(Shenyang) The news of the activities of the volunteer army in the three eastern provinces, as reported by the Chinese, has been verified by the Japanese in various parts of the Northeast. One incident occurred today and is related to the volunteer army. Last night, a train was derailed within ten kilometers of Jilin because the volunteer army broke the track, killing one Japanese woman and seriously wounding another with a gunshot. Yesterday, about forty members of the volunteer army attempted to destroy the South Manchuria Railway bridge two kilometers north of Heishitai (transliteration), but were repelled by the Japanese patrol, with three killed. The volunteer army's plan to bomb the Fushun coal mine and destroy its power equipment has also been verified by the Japanese. This plan was discovered two days before its scheduled implementation. It is rumored that the mastermind was a certain Lu, the director of the Fushun police station, who secretly colluded with the volunteer army. It is now believed that Lu and his accomplices have been arrested. The reason for the discovery was that a unit of the "Manchukuo" army was ordered to attack a unit of the volunteer army, and three Japanese were arrested and surrendered to the volunteer army. One of the three Japanese later escaped and reported to the Japanese headquarters in Fushun, thus solving the case. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>

I hope that everyone will be determined to carry out local reorganization work, which is to realize the second step of our plan. 2. Now that the bandit suppression campaign has come to an end, political facilities must catch up and economic policies must be established. What we have decided for Hubei at present, based on factual needs, are the two principles of rural revitalization and social stability. All political party affairs and military affairs must be carried out according to these principles. (12th Dispatch)</p>

On the 11th, he led his troops to attack their flanks and advanced to Damadian, 35 miles west of the city. The bandits have already collapsed and many have been captured. In addition, because the tenant farmers in Huoqiu County have long been oppressed by landlords, the Red bandits took the opportunity to incite them, and many farmers were deceived and joined the bandits. If measures are not taken to liberate them and fundamentally eliminate their hardships, they will report to Chairman Chiang and stipulate that the county will reduce rent by 25% and grant tenant farmers permanent tenancy rights, to be implemented by the Anhui provincial government.

<p>Decided Not to Appoint Another Person to Act as an Agent</p>
<p>During Wang Jingwei's Absence from Beijing</p>
<p>The Central Political Council is Changing to Discussion Groups</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After Wang Jingwei went to Shanghai for medical treatment, he sent two telegrams to the Central Government, requesting that a person be temporarily appointed as an agent according to precedent. The Central Committee discussion group on the 12th raised the original telegram for discussion. Tang Youren and Fang, the secretaries of the Central Political Council, returned from Shanghai and reported on Wang's recent illness, which showed no sign of improvement. He had a fever of 38 degrees Celsius for several days, a urine sugar level of 62, and was mentally abnormally weak. It would not be easy for him to recover in a few days without quiet rest. The Central Committee members then discussed the issue of a standing committee member of the Central Political Council acting as an agent. Everyone thought that Wang was suffering from illness and would soon recover without medicine. At this time, no one dared to accept this important task. As a result, it was decided that during Wang's absence from Beijing, the Central Political Council would change to discussion groups. All important cases would be telegraphed to Wang for instructions after resolution, and minor cases would be left to Wang to endorse after he recovered and returned to Beijing. On the one hand, Wu Tiecheng was telegraphed to find a good doctor in Shanghai to examine Wang so that he could recover soon. On the other hand, Tang Youren was sent to Shanghai on the evening of the 12th to express his condolences and convey the sincerity of the various committee members in urging him to come.

The date of his return to Beijing was still difficult to determine. Once he recovered, he would come to Beijing to preside over the important affairs of the Central Political Council.

<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Qun arrived in Beijing from Hankou on the Jiangshun ship at 11:00 a.m. on the 12th. After disembarking, he immediately visited various important figures in the Central Government. He took the night train to Shanghai that night, acting on behalf of Chairman Chiang to urge President Wang to return to Beijing. Zhang told reporters that he was going to Shanghai on Chiang's orders to represent him in visiting Lin and Wang for their illness, and to urge Wang to return to Beijing as soon as possible to preside over the central government's affairs. Chiang's suppression of the Red bandits in Hankou is progressing smoothly. In order to avoid stopping the bandit suppression military operations, it is temporarily difficult for him to come to Beijing. Chiang is very concerned about Wang's illness, and even more anxious about the lack of people presiding over the Central Government. Therefore, he ordered me to urge him. When I left Beiping for Hankou, North China was quite quiet, and there was no change in Rehe. Zhang Xueliang has decided to leave Beiping within a few days to visit Chiang in Hankou. The exact date has not been determined. It has not been heard that Zhang will come to Beijing. I have repeatedly presented my resignation to the Central Government from the position of member of the Military Affairs Committee's Beiping Branch, but it has not been approved. I am now reluctantly doing my best. As for the position of acting director of the Palace Museum, I have decided to resign because I cannot be stationed in Beiping permanently. As for the rumors that the Central Government will appoint me as the director of the Palace Museum, it is not accurate. I will go to Hankou again with Wang after returning to Beijing, and then return to Beiping. (Central News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>

<h3 id="e26">Nanjing Court Tries Ma Xihou Case <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Ma Xihou, a representative of the Nanjing citizens advocating for rent reduction, maintained a somewhat firm attitude. Mayor Shi Ying sent a letter to the Garrison Headquarters, requesting that he be charged with the serious crime of subverting the government. Gu Zhenglun believed that this matter should not be rushed and had presented a request to the Overseas Chinese Association for a warning first, but this was not approved and an arrest was not made. Subsequently, Shi Ying personally submitted a proposal to the Executive Yuan, which ordered the Garrison Headquarters to arrest Ma. Ma was arrested the week before and transferred to the court. All sectors believed that Ma had always been very popular and had thirteen volunteer lawyers willing to defend him. The criminal court heard the case on the 12th. The defendants, Ma Xihou and Gao Bengong, were present. The judge said to Ma, "The plaintiff, the Municipal Government, is suing you for attempting to subvert the government and inciting strikes, market boycotts, and reactionary activities, with leaflets as evidence." Ma stated that the leaflets were two documents submitted to the Municipal Government, explaining the provisional constitution and the legal protections that people should have, and contained no reactionary rhetoric. He requested an investigation. The judge questioned Ma Xihou further, asking who issued the leaflets. Ma replied that they were published by 132 organizations in the city, not by Xihou and the other two. He requested that the plaintiff, Mayor Shi, be summoned to provide evidence and confront him. He asked where the basis for the charges was, asserting that they were sometimes based on secret meetings and attempts at reaction, and sometimes on inciting strikes and market boycotts, which would put Xihou to death. The lawyers argued that the charges against the defendant were unfounded and requested a postponement until next week. They also requested that Ma Xihou be released on bail, which the court approved, and the hearing was scheduled for next week. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) The British Legation stated that reports that bandits were demanding a ransom of 250,000 yuan to release Mrs. Pawley and Mr. Corkran were unfounded. It is currently impossible to contact the bandits, so all ransom news is inaccurate. (12th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

The Chief of the Liaoning Provincial Police Department and the Director-General of Administration are both working hard to rescue them. The Director-General of Administration is a friend of Dr. Philip, Mrs. Pawley's father, and is therefore especially eager to see the two safely released. According to the latest information received here, aside from knowing that the bandits are taking the two towards Dashiqiao, there are no clues to be found. The British authorities here stated firmly that the arrival of the British warship HMS Sandwich in the port of Niuzhuang was to monitor the overall situation in the area and did not involve any intention to take action. (12th Reuters Dispatch) Niuzhuang Officials here deny that the bandits who kidnapped the two British citizens demanded a ransom of 250,000 yuan. In fact, the bandits have not yet made contact, and the Japanese side has spread rumors of a large ransom demand, which is regretted by many, as this may hinder the efforts of the local authorities to rescue the abducted persons. The weather is cold at night, and the abducted persons are thinly clothed, so they are likely to suffer greatly. The British warship HMS Sandwich has now arrived to monitor the situation.

<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 12th— The Preparatory Committee of the Privy Council considered the issue of recognizing "Manchukuo" on Sunday morning and unanimously passed the resolution. An imperial conference is expected to be held tomorrow, and it is expected that the Japanese government will formally announce the recognition of "Manchukuo" on Thursday. The Japanese government recently requested the League of Nations to postpone the discussion of the Lytton Commission report to await Japan's written opinion on the matter. This has been verified here. The written opinion can be drafted in about six weeks.</p>
<p>Japan News Agency, Tokyo, 12th— Regarding the basic matters of recognizing the Manchu puppet state, it is determined that the original proposal will be decided by the Privy Council's emergency meeting on the 13th.

<p>Electric News, Tokyo, 12th— The main points of the Privy Council's examination committee's questions yesterday were: 1. What is the impact of Japan's formal recognition of Manchukuo on international relations? 2. What is the government's attitude towards the impact on international relations? Foreign Minister Uchida replied that the result of formal recognition will inevitably cause temporary friction with the international community, but there will be no major impact. If anyone tries to stop it, the government is determined to eliminate it resolutely and move forward as planned. He then explained the attitudes of various countries, saying that the opposition of the British Labour Party is its traditional and natural position, but the Conservative Party generally adopts a well-intentioned attitude. Germany is divided into supporters and opponents, but its public opinion has not yet been decided. The Haas-affiliated newspapers in the United States all support Japan's recognition, while all others oppose it. Although the Soviet government in Moscow shows very good intentions, the Third International is quite active on the Russian-Manchu border, which requires some vigilance, but there is generally no need to worry, and so on.</p>
<p>China News Agency, Tokyo, 12th— Although there is a rise in voices advocating for a slow approach to the issue of recognizing Manchukuo within the Japanese Foreign Ministry, the general trend has succumbed to the strong demands of the Japanese military, and it has been decided to persist to the end with the League of Nations and the United States and Russia, disregard all existing treaties, and act recklessly. It is reported that after both parties sign the agreement on the 15th, it will be announced simultaneously in Tokyo and Changchun at 4:00 PM. Uchida will meet with ambassadors from various countries in Japan to explain the process of recognizing the puppet state, the content of the new treaty, and Japan's grievances about violating treaties, seeking the understanding of various countries.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 12th— It is heard today that "Manchukuo" will issue an important statement on the day it is recognized by Japan. Xie Jieshi, the Foreign Minister of "Manchukuo," has recently completed the draft.</p>
<p>Electric News, Tokyo, 12th— The Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that the formal relationship between Japan and Manchuria cannot be satisfied with a unilateral declaration. It intends to register it with the Secretariat of the League of Nations at the same time as recognition, so that the recognition of Manchukuo can be confirmed by the contracting countries. This opinion has recently been quite strong, but there are opponents. The reason is that Manchukuo itself is not in a hurry to join the League of Nations. If Japan proceeds with registration, it will give the League of Nations room for intervention in the relationship between Japan and Manchuria, which is not a good strategy for the Manchurian policy. The Ministry is divided into supporters and opponents on this registration issue. With formal recognition imminent, how this issue will be handled is particularly important.</p>

<p>The first batch of 1,000 veterans will depart in a month</p>
<p>They will be sent to northern Manchuria for military deployment against Russia</p>
<p>China News Agency, Tokyo Correspondent - The specific plan for armed immigration to the Three Eastern Provinces proposed by the Japanese Colonial Ministry has been approved by the Army Department at an interim meeting. It has been decided to allocate 205,500 Japanese yen as the budget for the first batch of armed immigrants. At present, recruitment of 1,000 veterans is underway in Ibaraki, Aomori, Iwate and other places, and a temporary armed immigrant training center has been established to start training invasion methods and military deployments. The training period is scheduled to be completed in one month. According to investigations, the first batch will depart one month later, led by personnel dispatched by the Japanese military. They are prepared to use the Songhua River as a base, forcibly ordering the puppet state to allocate 20,000 chōbu (approximately 100 hectares per chōbu) of fertile land, with 15 chōbu allocated to each person. In addition, a six-year plan will provide each household with 1,200 yuan in advance as development expenses. Other weapons will be supplied separately by the Army Department. The departure of the first batch, ostensibly for cultivating soybeans, wheat, cotton, and wool, is actually under secret orders from a certain party to prepare military roads from the north of Korea, Qingjin, to Harbin, and along the Songhua River, in order to facilitate future attacks on the Soviet Union. Not only can they seize land without compensation, but they can also strengthen their military deployment. The Japanese means of aggression can be described as all-pervasive.</p>

<p>The Military Will Deal with It Severely</p>
<p>The Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun reports that on the 15th of last month, Dr. Toru Nagai, a professor of economics at Nihon University, gave a speech at the Sendai Chamber of Commerce and Industry entitled "Ideological Criticism of the Current Situation." He said that Japan's capitalist economic organization is already mature, and the authorities are touting industrial rationalization, but unexpectedly, due to the rationalization problem, the number of unemployed has increased to 500,000. (Omitted) Now Japan is relying on military force to make Manchuria an independent country, and is trying to economically control Japan and Manchuria. It is not known that after the economic control of Japan and Manchuria is realized, it will instead promote the demise of Japan. In particular, the Japanese army, under the pretext of maintaining security, has actually engaged in actions similar to those of bandits, disrupting security. (Omitted) At present, there is a latent fascist ideology within the Army Department. We citizens should rise up and overthrow this incompetent government and impeach the military, otherwise the country will be in danger, etc. Since Nagai</p>

<p>Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun reports that on the 6th, the air and naval forces conducted a war game off the coast of Wakayama Prefecture. Amidst rainy weather, two fighter planes from the aircraft carrier Hosho, engaged in an aerial combat drill, collided in mid-air and crashed into the sea. The occupants were also lost. The pilots of the two planes were Navy Captain Atsumi Shinichi and Petty Officer 3rd Class Inoue Yoshio. Atsumi Shinichi volunteered during the Shanghai War to bomb the Jianqiao Airfield in Hangzhou, achieving remarkable feats. He also encountered an American pilot, Xiao Tuo, piloting a Chinese aircraft, leading to a fierce aerial battle. His relentless pursuit of the enemy aircraft was highly effective, earning him widespread fame. He was a promising young officer. Now, he has tragically drowned during an aerial combat drill. Furthermore, on the same day at 1:00 PM, two attack planes from the Tateyama Naval Air Group, No. 308 piloted by Captain Kami-Hitsu, and No. 306 piloted by Captain Hayashi, also crashed into the sea. The aircraft were completely submerged.</p>

<p>Reuters, Berlin, 12th - The Reichstag was dissolved today. A follow-up report states that the Social Democratic Party introduced a motion to immediately repeal all emergency decrees. In response, the National Socialist Party proposed a postponement of the session to consider the overall situation. However, President Hindenburg's decree dissolving the Reichstag was promptly announced. The arrangement for today's Reichstag meeting was disrupted by the Social Democratic Party's resolution to introduce a motion to abolish all emergency decrees. Chancellor Papen intended to discuss the government's economic program, but according to Reichstag regulations, the Social Democratic Party's motion, unopposed, had to be debated immediately. The National Socialist Party then moved to postpone the session to consider the overall situation. The Reichstag subsequently debated a motion of no confidence in the government, proposed by the Communist Party, which also called for the abolition of all decrees. It passed by a vote of 513 to 32, with only 50 abstentions. While the Reichstag was voting, Chancellor Papen informed President Hindenburg. The President, unwilling to hear the details, led Papen to leave the Reichstag. Shortly after, the President issued a decree dissolving the Reichstag.</p>

<p>British Officialdom Sees Room for Political Mediation</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 11th - The French response to the German memorandum requesting equality in armaments was delivered to German Foreign Minister Neurath this afternoon by French Ambassador François-Poncet. The full text will be released simultaneously in Berlin and Paris on Monday evening. However, its content, as predicted by the French press, is generally accepted as accurate, and it is not expected to cause surprise worldwide after its release. Therefore, the German press is currently only reporting the simple facts and reiterating Germany's demand for equality, which is backed by the vast majority of public opinion. Foreign Minister Neurath previously stated that if Germany was refused a completely frank exchange of views with the German government, it would lead Germany to a new situation, necessitating a separate decision. However, the political situation remains chaotic, and the nation's attention is currently focused on domestic affairs, temporarily viewing the French response as secondary. Havas, London, 12th - According to reliable sources, British officialdom believes that the wording of the French government's note to Germany is conciliatory and leaves room for political mediation. However, this is contingent on Berlin adopting a calm and moderate attitude. British political circles also stated that Prime Minister MacDonald is deeply concerned about the British Foreign Office's handling of this matter. The key point of this attitude is the hope of averting a crisis in the Disarmament Conference. Britain is reportedly considering pre-negotiations between major European countries and Germany before the resumption of the Disarmament Conference.</p>

<p>Herriot Full of Peaceful Words</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 11th - France held the 18th anniversary commemoration of the Battle of the Marne during the Franco-German War in Machaon. During the ceremony, Premier Herriot delivered a lengthy speech, expressing deep gratitude to the British for their donations and praising the recent efforts of the Americans for peace. Herriot also addressed accusations that France was a belligerent nation, specifically stating that France had made concessions and sacrifices to consolidate peace. Herriot said, "In our land, we hope that peace is advocated everywhere, and that military force is never promoted, because once military force is launched, its harm will be incalculable." Herriot also recalled the events of 1914, saying that even the most solemn treaties could not protect the land and the most law-abiding people. Therefore, the French people are now uneasy at the sound of dangerous movements. He believes that the fair-minded people of the world will understand this anxiety. Although the French are anxious, they are clear-headed and still willing to reconcile with people, even with those who once invaded France, and are happy to be on good terms with them. A celebratory banquet was held on the same day. At the end of the banquet, the Minister of War delivered a speech, vaguely mentioning the increasing meaningful demonstrations on the other side of the Rhine, stating that France had made unprecedented sacrifices and must therefore have sufficient troops to defend its borders so that its territory would not be ravaged again. It is unacceptable for France to have this military force taken away.</p>

<p>Praises the Courageous Spirit of Chinese Staff</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 12th - The Times of London published an article by Sir John Hope Simpson, who recently went to China to investigate the flood disaster. The article praised the great assistance, organizational abilities, and extraordinary courage of the Chinese technical staff of the Flood Relief Committee. He continued that the Relief Committee's work north of the Yangtze River was hampered by local communist bandits. Furthermore, the communist bandits in Henan attacked the Relief Committee's office, looting all the stored grain and cash. However, after the bandits retreated, the Relief Committee recruited new staff and resumed work. Sir Simpson estimated that a total of one thousand workers north of the Yangtze River had died due to communist bandit attacks in a month. The Times published an editorial regarding Sir Simpson's article, stating that the Chinese staff of the Relief Committee did not flinch in the face of danger, and their courageous spirit can be seen in Sir Simpson's article. This excellent achievement in the Yangtze River basin, where communism is spreading and bandits abound, makes one feel that the Chinese deserve better guidance than that provided by the revolution.</p>

<p>Northeast People United Against Japan</p>
<p>Volunteer Armies Vigorously Hinder Japanese Road Construction</p>
<p>Sawed-off Leg, Shi Pan Returns to the Front</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: According to people from Shanhaiguan, the people of Northeast China, enraged by the Japanese army, are abandoning their wives and children to join the volunteer armies, engaging in sabotage of Japanese transportation and construction. Their actions are unpredictable. Even the pseudo-Fengshan Road is frequently attacked by the volunteer armies. Recently, the Japanese army has dispatched armored vehicles to protect passenger trains, but they are still not safe. There are incidents almost daily. The passenger train on the 6th was obstructed in Lianshan and arrived at Yuguan one hour and thirty minutes late. The passenger train on the 7th was obstructed in Xinglongdian and arrived at Yuguan one hour and forty minutes late. The passenger train on the 8th was obstructed in Qiansuo and arrived at Yuguan fifty minutes late. According to people from Xinmin, Jin Yutian's unit of the National Salvation Army, led by Zhu Jiqing, is currently stationed near Yingkou Koukou Village, doing its best to protect the area, which has won the favor of the people. More than ten village chiefs have automatically convened and decided to supply Jin's unit with military pay and bullets.</p>
<p>Dai Jimin, Zhu Jiqing's representative, sent a report from Yongji on the 3rd of this month: 1. After the Japanese army occupied Ningguta, they immediately began constructing a military motor road between Ningdun (Dunhua). It was repeatedly attacked and destroyed by the volunteer army, so construction was stopped. However, construction of the railway between Ji (Yanji) and Dun (Dunhua) began simultaneously from both locations in late July, with tunnels being dug in Badian. Many sleepers have been piled up along the way, and steel rails are also being transported one after another. Judging from the situation, it seems they want to complete it before the freezing season. Therefore, the National Salvation Army units of Yang Jingchen, Qiao Xudong, Zhao Yongsheng, Wang Delin, Yu Zuosheng, Ren Fangqiu, etc., are planning to seize the opportunity to vigorously prevent the completion of the road. 2. The Jidong Volunteer Army has been fighting hard for several months without any supplies, and is now in dire need of ammunition, making it difficult to move. There is currently no problem with food, but many crops have been destroyed by artillery fire, which will greatly affect the autumn harvest, and the future is also worrying. 3. During this flood, the dikes upstream of the Songhua River were relatively strong and did not cause major disasters. However, the disaster situation in the Harbin area is extremely severe, unprecedented in decades. The people are displaced and suffering, even more tragically than the Wuhan flood last year.</p>
<p>Shi Pan, the commander of the 13th Route Army of the Volunteer Army, was fighting the Japanese in Suizhong when he was hit by an enemy bullet. He had his left leg amputated at the Pingde German Hospital, fitted with a wooden leg, and was discharged from the hospital last month. He will rush to the front to reorganize his troops and raise supplies in Beijing and Shanghai. Yesterday (9th), he passed through Tianjin from Beijing to Ping. The reporter met him at the station. According to him, the results of this trip were satisfactory. He will prepare winter clothing and bullets for his troops before going to the front. In short, as long as he has a breath, he will vow to kill the enemy to the end. In the past, due to unsuccessful communication, his troops suffered some setbacks. Currently, in addition to Wang Yuwen and Kang Juwu actively contacting each other, he has also obtained considerable contact with Ma Zhanshan, with the aim of recovering his homeland as soon as possible. However, the Northeast aftermath issues and long-term supplies should be given special attention by the people of the country (10th).</p>

<p>Investigating Commission Returning by Water</p>
<p>In the clear autumn air, warm sun, and gentle breeze, the League of Nations Investigating Commission, entrusted with a mission of peace, has completed its task and gracefully left China.</p>
<p>The Gange is the smallest of the Italian mail ships. With the League of Nations General Assembly approaching, many distinguished guests gathered, including Lord Lytton, Count Aldrovandi, General McCoy and his wife, and Minister Gu Weijun. Over a hundred people saw them off, including President Wang Jingwei, Ministers Song Ziwen and Luo Wengan, Vice Ministers Liu Chongjie and Xu Mo, and Mayor Wu Tiecheng. It can be said to be a grand occasion. The Italian Minister, Count Galeazzo Ciano, even came from Beiping to see them off, perhaps because the investigating commission was traveling on a ship of his country and he had a responsibility to entertain them. At dinner, the captain had Mrs. McCoy on his right and Minister Gu on his left, with Count Aldrovandi sitting opposite, General McCoy on his right, and Lord Lytton on his left. Aldrovandi also acted like a half-host, emphasizing the importance of national identity.</p>
<p>The investigating commission arrived in Shanghai on March 14th and left Shanghai on September 5th, a period of nearly six months. They traveled nearly 30,000 miles, enduring dust and hardship, rarely staying in one place for long. What they painstakingly compiled is a historical report of over 10,000 words. The content of the report is still kept secret, but some general ideas can be gleaned from private conversations, namely, that the report, in addition to the narration of facts, is able to uphold justice in its conclusions. The three members of the investigating commission originally each had their own positions. It is said that those who have close relations with Japan strongly advocate paying attention to the current situation. After a long period of research and contention with our country's representatives, they set aside the Northeast issue to think for the League of Nations itself. Since it has no power to suppress violence, if it continues to accommodate the present situation, what is the value of this organization, and how can it survive? Therefore, the wording is ultimately cautious.</p>
<p>The Japanese gave the investigating commission a very thorough reception. In terms of material and social facilities, they were far beyond what our country could hope to match. However, the Japanese were insincere, resorting to all sorts of deception, which made the recipients uneasy. It was better to have our country do its best, treat them with sincerity, and gain some goodwill in return. This is something to be thankful for. However, in these past six months, there have been many signs of being stretched thin. In general, legality places the most importance on facts, but from the time of the September 18th Incident until the investigating commission came east, our country was not prepared to collect evidence. The files were incomplete and scattered in Nanjing, Beiping, Luoyang, and other places. The figures were particularly inaccurate. For example, the population of the Northeast, the products that the Northeast supplied to the mainland, and the money that the mainland invested in the Northeast, varied from person to person, and it was not easy to obtain a definite answer. Moreover, scholars in the country were scattered in various places due to livelihood pressures, making it very difficult to solicit opinions. Or they could only write in Chinese, which had to be translated into English and French, or they only knew one part of a problem, which had to be combined with other materials, so the procedures were time-consuming. Also, our country's hotels do not have high-end, luxurious facilities that can accommodate many people. In the end, we had to stay in foreign hotels everywhere. I still remember the Hankou National Hotel, which initially only had four rooms, and then reluctantly added two more, but they were only enough for the investigating commission to rest and work. As a result, Minister Gu wandered around in public rooms all day, receiving guests. The same was true for ships. We could not find them in our country's shipping industry, and we had to abide by their rules when taking foreign ships, which was very inconvenient. In addition to the major ports of Tianjin and Shanghai, there was also a great lack of cars. When passing through Jiujiang, public buses were even used as a substitute, which was laughable. Learn from the past, and it will guide the future. All of these things should be reflected upon. The Chinese delegation supplied the investigating commission with 29 types of written statements, all of which refuted the Japanese's excuses from a legal perspective. At the same time, the investigating commission asked more than a thousand questions about history, geography, personnel, products, and finance, which were answered separately by our side. There were not many public meetings, but Minister Gu had as many as forty private conversations with Lord Lytton, all to clarify issues that had arisen or were about to arise in advance or temporarily. The drafting, translation, and printing of these written statements and answers, as well as the paper and printing costs, were enormous. Each type was printed in 500 or 1,000 copies, both in English and French. At the time, there were no large printing houses that could be responsible for completing the work on time, so we had to go to small printing houses in Tianjin and Shanghai, dividing the work and printing day and night in shifts. The proofreading was hastily gathered on the spot, and the investigating commission was urging us very urgently. It was not until September 2nd that it was finally completed, which was very laborious. Now, they are all packed into wooden boxes and transported with us to Geneva for distribution to the member states of the League of Nations for reference. Those who engaged in the work of the delegation this time were all volunteers. Starting with Minister Gu, each person received a daily stipend of 100 yuan. Therefore, the total cost of travel and sightseeing expenses paid by the delegation was only 220,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Those who accompanied the investigating commission included Secretary Beadle, Cerker, Lord Lytton's personal secretary Easton, and two stenographers. Those who accompanied Minister Gu included Xiao Jirong, counselor of the French embassy, and Chuan Xiaofeng, second secretary. Qian Tai, Yan Deqing, Wang Dazhen, specialized members of the Chinese delegation to Geneva, and Zou Enzhun, secretary. Minister Gu will first go to Paris to submit his credentials and then go to Geneva. Shi Deqian, first secretary of the French embassy, and Xiao Hua, a trainee, will accompany Mrs. Gu to travel abroad next month. Ms. Zhong Xianying, Wang Dazhen's wife, and Ms. Yan Lianying, the wife of military attache Yao Xijiu of the French embassy, will also travel together this time. Ms. Zhong graduated from Bucknell University in the United States and is very proficient in English, always serving as her husband's translator. This is both an internal and external help (Published in Hong Kong on September 7th).</p>
<h3 id="e76">Full Text of the Noulens Case Verdict <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Defendant: Noulens, male, 34 years old, stateless, currently in custody; Wang Delizeng, female, 36 years old, stateless, currently in custody; Appointed defense attorney, Attorney Chen Ying; The right defendants, in a case of endangering the Republic of China, were prosecuted by the prosecutor, and this court renders the following verdict:</p>
<p>Main Text: Noulens and Wang Delizeng, acting jointly for the purpose of endangering the Republic of China and disrupting public order, are each sentenced to life imprisonment, with deprivation of civil rights for life. The evidence of the crime in the case, three steel boxes, including keys, four envelopes, six yuan eight jiao four fen in silver dollars, eight hundred and twenty-three US dollars, one hundred and fifty Japanese yen, and the original documents, are all confiscated. The remaining parts are acquitted.</p>
<p>Facts: Noulens was originally a member of the Third International Communist Party and was sent by the Third International as the director of the Far East Bureau. He came to China in March of the 19th year of the Republic of China to engage in communist work. He rented houses at No. 235 Sichuan Road, No. 30, Floor C, No. 49 Nanjing Road, No. 74 Hongye Garden, Yuyuan Road, and No. 66 Hart Road in Shanghai for residence and as offices, and rented eight post office boxes, registered four places with the China Wireless Telegraph Bureau for use as communist communications. On one hand, he colluded with traitors Zhu De, Mao Zedong, He Long, etc., and launched large-scale riots in Hunan, Jiangxi and other provinces, devastating the local areas. On the other hand, he divided and transferred the Red Army's Seventh Army, Twentieth Army, and other troops to Tahe (transliterated place name), Xiaoshu (transliterated place name), Fujian, Hunan, Guangdong, and other places to engage in disruption work, attacking the National Army. He also devised a plan to send party members to Nanjing to incite soldiers, mechanics, pilots, guards, and garrison brigades of the Aviation Administration to mutiny in order to increase their own strength. He also suggested preparing Soviet areas at the junction of Henan, Anhui, and Hubei provinces, received money from the Third International, and distributed it to the Southern Bureau, Yangtze River Bureau, Northern Bureau, and Jiangnan Bureau that he had established, inciting farmers, workers, and people to launch a new revolutionary upsurge and initiate class warfare. In addition, he incited workers, disrupted order, and issued slogans such as "Down with the Kuomintang," "Drive out the Kuomintang and the running dogs of imperialism," "Support the Chinese Revolution," and "Support the Chinese Soviet," and so on, which are too numerous to mention. The communist movements in India, the Philippines, the Malay Archipelago, Korea, Annam, Japan, and other places were all under his control. In June of the 20th year of the Republic of China, the Shanghai Public Concession Police learned of this and arrested Noulens on the 15th of the same month in the house at No. 235 Sichuan Road. They then searched the various houses he had rented and used the key hidden on Noulens's body to open the door of Room C-30 at No. 49 Nanjing Road. From the wall cabinet in the room, they took out three steel boxes containing many documents that were evidence of the crime in this case, as well as four envelopes, one containing eight hundred US dollars, one containing twenty-three US dollars, one containing one hundred and fifty Japanese yen, and one containing six yuan eight jiao four fen in silver dollars. Previously, when Noulens was sent as the director of the Far East Bureau, the Third International also sent the female communist Wang Delizeng to monitor the bureau. She lived in the same place as Noulens and participated in confidential matters. When the Shanghai police searched Room C-30 at No. 49 Nanjing Road, they found a note in French on Wang Delizeng, which was an appointment to meet Noulens in the room at 2:00 PM that afternoon. The detectives closed the door from the inside and waited quietly for Wang Delizeng. As expected, she arrived on time, opened the door with her own key, and was arrested as well. The documents of Wang Delizeng and Noulens jointly committing crimes were found in the steel box. Therefore, they were arrested and brought to justice along with the human witnesses. After investigation, the prosecutor of this court filed a public prosecution in accordance with Articles 1, 2, 5, 6, and 10 of the Emergency Law for the Punishment of Endangering the Republic of China, and Article 60, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law.</p>
<p>Reasons: Although Noulens and Wang Delizeng each deny the crime of endangering the Republic of China, the various evidence obtained by this court's investigation is sufficient to fully prove it. The explanations are as follows: 1. Regarding Noulens, the three steel boxes seized in Room C-30 at No. 49 Nanjing Road contain many important documents about the Communist Party. Regarding these documents, one aspect should be the study of the content and records, and the other aspect should be the study of who owns them. The former is the issue of evidence of the crime, and the latter is the issue of the subject of the crime. Now, let us first discuss the evidence of the crime. The documents seized in this case, excluding those involving the Philippines, the Malay Archipelago, Korea, India, Annam, Japan, and other places, only the documents concerning China are sufficient to prove the crime, and there are no less than seventy types (all listed in the A-numbered exhibits). The most prominent ones are as follows: (A) Suggestions to Pia Ai, stating that "At present, the main task of the political parties, the Fourth Army, and the independent divisions organized by our party must be to prepare a Soviet division in the area where Anhui, Hunan, and Hubei provinces meet (approximately Bnsnan Kwangchow, the southwestern part of Anhui, and the northeastern part of Hubei). To achieve this, we must unite the Red Army with the power of ordinary farmers and solve the white army in this area. Before this main force succeeds in solving the white army in this area, the main force of the Red Army must not be sent along the Pinghan Line. Near the railway, farmers and workers must be incited to initiate class warfare and organize small Red Army units to implement a policy of terror against the railway. Farmers can develop their land, approximately in Sinantien and Tienanfu. If the enemy troops voluntarily leave the above-mentioned areas, the Red Army can pursue them with all its strength until they surrender. If the enemy is numerous and the Red Army is defeated, it can take a defensive posture and retreat to its original position if necessary to avoid losing the main force of our army (the rest omitted) (Exhibit A, No. 68, See Exhibit Register No. 2, Page 9) (B) Suggestions on working in the army, such as the above-mentioned strategy, the offensive that we take against the Es area and the position of the Kuomintang army, should be to regard the army of the Kuomintang by means of separation and by means of political tactics. The most important political task of the Communist Party. At present, whether our party's resistance work against attacking the Es area can be fulfilled, especially whether our party's political and organizational work in the army can be carried out diligently, is the turning point.

<h3 id="e77">Central and National Government Memorial Week <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>The Luoyang Provisional Central Party Headquarters and the National Government held Premier Sun Yat-sen Memorial Weeks at 9:00 AM on the 12th in the reception hall of the Central Party Headquarters and the Great Hall of the National Government respectively. The Beijing Office of the Central Party Headquarters also held a memorial week at 9:00 AM. Central Committee members Gu Mengyu, Ye Chucang, Shi Ying, Xiao Jishan, Xiao Zhongzhen, Wang Qi, Li Zonghuang, Fang Juehui, Huang Fusheng, and over 600 staff members attended. After the ceremony led by Chairman Gu Mengyu, Shi Ying reported on the general situation of education in Beijing, stating that the underdevelopment of primary education in Beijing was beyond expectation. According to the statistics of the Beijing Municipal Education Bureau for the 19th year (of the Republic), there were over 77,000 school-age children in the city, but only over 10,000 were in municipal or private primary schools. Most of the children were in private schools, and over 30,000 children in the city were out of school. Therefore, people generally say that it is more difficult to find schooling for their children than to find a job. It is imperative to find ways to provide relief. Starting next semester, 30 simplified compulsory primary schools will be added. Each school will adopt a half-day system, with four grades, each with 50 students, accommodating about 6,000 to 7,000 students. The number of classes in primary schools in Sanpailou and other places will also be increased, which can accommodate another 1,000 students. As for the increased educational expenses, in addition to the start-up fee of over 10,000 yuan, an additional 10,000 yuan will be required each month. If this can be expanded from now on, year by year, then in three or four years, all out-of-school children in the city should have the opportunity to go to school. According to the statistics of the 19th year, the total educational expenses for municipal schools in the city was over 330,000 yuan, and the total number of students in municipal schools was over 12,000, with an average of 27 yuan of educational expenses per student per year. If this is the standard, and if all 30,000 out-of-school children are to receive education, then the educational expenses must increase by nearly one million yuan per year to solve the problem. However, this cannot be achieved with Beijing's current financial resources. Therefore, the addition of simplified compulsory primary schools this time is to provide relief to a large number of out-of-school children with less funding. Not only are public expenses less, but individual burdens are also lighter. This is a manifestation of striving for popularization under the aristocratic education system. As for Beijing's supplementary education, it can be divided into: 1. Establishing mass schools, 2. Preparing for literacy campaigns, 3. Establishing adult supplementary schools, 4. Improving women's vocational supplementary schools, etc., all of which are being actively carried out.</p>

<p>Request to Verify and Collect Land Survey Fees: The people of Songjiang County believe that the provincial order to collect land survey fees for land consolidation at the rate of one dime per mu, with the clause that any amount less than one mu is counted as one mu, not only sets a precedent that has never existed in previous collections, but also violates the principle of equal tax burden. Therefore, county residents such as Yang submitted petitions to the provincial, departmental, and county bureaus, stating that the collection of land price tax and mu donation should be based on the completed mu, verified and remitted according to the established case. There has never been a precedent of rounding up fractions to increase the burden on the people. Moreover, most of the tax amounts on the certificates have fractions of cents, and very few are whole numbers, especially the tax amounts in towns, which are mostly in fractions of cents. If fractions are rounded up, it will inevitably be like draining the pond to catch all the fish, and it will violate the principle of equal tax burden. The people of Songjiang have survived the war, and their savings have been exhausted. Please take into consideration the people's difficulties and still follow the established case for collection, verifying and collecting according to the completed mu for each certificate, so as to eliminate long-standing malpractices and show verification.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Grass Tennis Doubles Qiu and Lin Play Today <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Against Jiang Daozhang and Canavero</p>
<p>3:30 PM at Father Rohde Road</p>
<p>Lin Qiu Won Over Kocha and Maseru Yesterday</p>
<p>The open doubles competition of the Shanghai Grass Tennis Club, Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai played against Maseru and Kocha yesterday at the China Tennis Court for the preliminary round. As a result, Lin and Qiu won with a straight three sets. Today at 3:30 PM, Lin and Qiu will play against Canavero and Jiang Daozhang in the second week of the competition at the China Tennis Club. Canavero is a Shanghai doubles expert with agility and Jiang Daozhang's prestige is still there. Today will give Lin and Qiu a fierce competition. Tickets are six corners and can be entered from Ma Lang Road. The results yesterday were as follows:</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai and Lin Baohua 7-5, 6-1, 6-4 over Kocha and Maseru</p>
<p>The competition situation yesterday was very loose, so there was nothing wonderful to say. However, the Portuguese players were unusually stable and performed miracles every time. The combination of Lin and Qiu was not tight enough, with many gaps, which were repeatedly attacked by the enemy. In the first set, the Kocha-Maseru team took the lead many times. When they were about to win at 5-4, it suddenly rained, and the game was temporarily suspended for about five minutes. When the rain stopped and the game continued, the ground was wet and slippery, which was not conducive to running. However, Lin and Qiu finally regained the first set with 7-5 and won the next set with 6-1. In the third set, Kocha and Maseru once took the lead with a 4-2 lead, but were finally overtaken by Lin and Qiu with four consecutive games.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Lingnan defeated Qiangnan 10-0</p>
<p>In the summer soccer tournament, yesterday Lingnan's A team played Qiangnan at the baseball field starting at 5 o'clock. Lingnan is full of talent, with many famous players from the sea. The newly emerging Zhang Nan team dared not challenge their prowess. As a result, Lingnan won by a large margin of 10-0, scoring four goals in the first half and half a dozen in the second half. There will be two matches this afternoon, with the following schedule:</p>
<p>Team Names and Groups Time and Venue Referee</p>
<p>Youth vs. Yuqing (Division Two) 4:50 PM, Baseball Field Chen Jixiang</p>
<p>Jinde vs. Xingguang (Division One) 4:50 PM, Soccer Field Lu Xiangqian</p>
<h3 id="e95">First Sound of the Football War: Donghua vs. Lincoln <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Today at 3 PM at the Baseball Field</p>
<p>Lincoln's Strength is Well-Known at Sea</p>
<p>Donghua is Full of Talent, A Fierce Battle is Expected</p>
<p>Feng Yunyou Officially Becomes a Donghua Member</p>
<p>The Donghua soccer team, supported by the enthusiastic Mr. Sheng Pingchen, along with the newly hired Mr. Chen Jinjiang, is determined to reorganize. They have hired the Westerner Mr. Li Silian as coach, widely recruiting talent to expand their ambitions. As previously reported, the team has arranged a first official practice match at the China baseball field against the British army stationed in Shanghai, the Lincoln Fleet, which is renowned in the maritime soccer world.</p>
<p>Last winter, the Lincoln team took the place of the Norsenburg Army to participate in the Westerners' soccer league, ranking first in the A division. They also obtained a rematch right with Donghua and the Western police in the Scott Cup. The team's skills have long been appreciated by soccer fans. Four or five players are also formal members of the inter-port team. Therefore, their strength is uniquely dominant in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Donghua's lineup today: goalkeeper Zhou Xianyan has not yet arrived in Shanghai, so Lu Zhongen will fill in, which should not diminish the team's strength. The halfbacks and inner forwards are exceptionally solid. The only missing players are forwards Dai Linjing and Li Yichen. Now Ouyang Yongyuan and Chen Yutian will assist, with Chen Hongguang as center forward and Qian Jingyong and Xi Qiaosheng on the wings, still very fierce. Feng Yunyou was originally a Jinan player but has now officially joined the Donghua club as a member, which is also a welcome event for Donghua.</p>
<p>All of Donghua's players are scattered throughout the teams in the summer league. After several appearances, their physical strength has been fully restored. The Lincoln team is still making its first appearance, so in today's match, Donghua is expected to have excellent results. Maritime soccer fans, after a long separation from Donghua, will flock to the China baseball field for a feast for the eyes.</p>
<p>The following Donghua players are requested to gather at the Donghua clubhouse on Jing'an Temple Road before 2:30 PM this afternoon for a discussion before heading to the baseball field together. Tickets will be sold at a uniform price of 40 cents of small money. Enter through the two gates at the intersection of Labour Father Road (Avenue Dubail) and Ma Lang Road (Rue Massenet). Donghua's lineup is as follows:</p>
<p>Lu Zhongen</p>
<p>Wang Changying Li Ning Feng Yunyou</p>
<p>Wu Youliang Guan Xunan Kaiyuan Chen Jiaqiu</p>
<p>Qian Jingyong Wan Xianghua Ouyang Yong Chen Hongguang Chen Yutian Xi Qiaosheng Cao Qiuting Yuan</p>

<p>Result: 2 to 1</p>
<p>The 20th Army soccer team played against the Shuying team yesterday at the China baseball field. Shuying is organized by Sichuan athletes from various Shanghai schools. They once requested to represent West China University in the national regional soccer competition two years ago but were unsuccessful, so their strength is quite impressive. In yesterday's match, Shuying had the upper hand in the first half. Yu Shunzhang first broke through the 20th Army's goal and missed many opportunities. In the second half, the 20th Army's offensive was extremely strong. Liu Ximeng and Yin Li scored two goals one after another. As a result, the 20th Army reversed the defeat with a score of 2-1. The lineups were as follows:</p>
<p>20th Army</p>
<p>Huang Ying</p>

Whenever he has free time, he goes to the Central Swimming Pool with his younger brother Xingzhi to practice and guide fellow swimmers. Many who have received his guidance have been successful. Their skills, especially in the 1500-meter, are remarkable, with very little difference from the Far Eastern Games. Their recent achievements are as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e102">The Assassin Named Zheng <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>An assassin named Zheng said: "I am killing this traitor for the sake of the world, and I will not regret dying." This assassin was Zheng Huchen, who lived in the Song Dynasty. He once killed Jia Sidao at the Mian'an Temple in Zhangzhou, which is a memorable event in past history.</p>
<p>Another assassin named Zheng said: "He came to die, and I risked killing him. First, to glorify the party and the country, second, to glorify the revolution, third, to eliminate harm for Shandong, and fourth, to avenge my uncle. Now that the great revenge has been avenged, I have long disregarded my life and death." This assassin was Zheng Jicheng, who lives in modern times. He recently killed Zhang Zongchang at the Jinan Railway Station, which is a memorable event in modern history.</p>
<p>The words spoken by both assassins were selfless dedication to eliminate harm for the people. How慷慨激昂! Those who believe in karma may suspect that the modern Zheng Jicheng is the reincarnation of Zheng Huchen of the Song Dynasty. However, Zhang Zongchang's qualifications for evil are not comparable to Jia Sidao. Sidao not only harmed the country but also betrayed it. Zongchang was a perverse warlord who actually understood that betraying the country was not a business, and he refused to use the title of his ancestor Zhang Bangchang. This person still had a glimmer of clarity. After his death, most people applauded, but a small number of people still lamented for him? They lamented that his awakening came too late. Zheng Huchen killed Jia Sidao and also died under the law. Zheng Jicheng killed Zhang Zongchang, I wonder if he can be granted leniency? In Mian'an Temple in Zhangzhou, later generations erected a stone stele with the inscription "Song Zheng Huchen killed Jia Sidao here." According to Minzhong Fuwen, I wonder if anyone will erect a stone stele near the Jinan Railway Station with the inscription "Republic of China Year 21, Zheng Jicheng killed Zhang Zongchang here?" These are all future events, no need to predict, we can only wait and see?</p>
<h3 id="e103">God's Random Talk <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— Hong Liu</p>
<p>The British scholar Spencer said: "The missionary holds the Bible in one hand and tells us very kindly: "We must be charitable. When others hit our left cheek, we must also turn our right cheek to bear it. Resistance is barbaric, revenge is a sin! We must be docile, as docile as sheep, and God will give you eternal happiness!" But when his country is at war with another country, he will grit his teeth and tell us: "We must rise up! Take our guns and aim at our enemies! We must use iron and blood to win our final victory!" Many people think this is a very contradictory thing, but in fact, it is very logical: he tells us to be charitable for the sake of human survival, and he tells us to fight with the enemy for the sake of human survival: in the world, this is the same need."</p>
<p>Therefore, for us Western civilized people, wherever a missionary goes, there will be a fearsome warship following him, opening up with dignified authority. This is very reasonable. We are not like that. Morality has always had no boundaries. He tells you to be kind and tolerant in dealing with people. When a robber holds a steel knife against your neck, he still tells you to be kind and tolerant. If you move even a little, we civilized Westerners will scold you for being barbaric, for being a semi-civilized person. Don't say that General Zhang's non-resistance policy is a timeless wonder, it is the most civilized behavior in the world!</p>
<h3 id="e104">National Salvation Should Be Divided into Two Major Groups <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— Yuan Wenxin</p>
<p>"Struggle, self-determination, bloodshed!"</p>
<p>In this critical moment of life and death, we can no longer speak empty words. The enemy's ambition for aggression has long been revealed. What is justice, what is peace? We can only bleed, we can only struggle, we can only self-determine!</p>
<p>My meaning is to divide the compatriots of the whole country into two major groups. One group immediately goes to fight, and the other group endures death to nurture the orphans of this Republic of China.</p>
<p>For those who die first, there is certainly the spirit of "the head can be broken, but the will cannot be bent," but for those who die later, the responsibility is more important, the work is more difficult, and they must not fail the obligation of entrusting orphans to those who die first.</p>
<p>We who want to be those who die later must have the following goals: First, we must recognize the enemy and not be used or seduced by them, and do things "with one heart and one mind" based on our conscience.</p>
<p>Second, we must support those who die first, encourage those who die first, and comfort those who die first, so that they can kill the enemy with peace of mind.</p>
<p>Third, we must not be greedy, lazy, selfish, or cause trouble ourselves, and intensify our obligations.</p>
<p>Compatriots! Isn't the enemy's flag still flying in the Northeast? Isn't the sound of resistance from the Northeast Volunteer Army lengthening day by day? I am one who dies first, I am one who dies later, and I will quickly do it according to my own wishes! Compatriots! Work hard! Work hard!</p>

<p>— Xu Yi</p>
<p>"Whether the country survives or not? It depends on whether you can implement it."</p>
<p>1.  Principles</p>
<p>Production: Machine production. Concentrate engineering talents and build machines ourselves. Immigrate and colonize the borders, plant forests and build roads to alleviate the excess of labor.</p>
<p>Consumption: Use less foreign goods, ride cars less, watch movies less, and go to dance halls less. Weddings and funerals should all be simplified.</p>
<p>Distribution: It is important to be even. The rich should do more charitable work, such as helping the poor and elderly, and caring for widows and orphans.</p>
<p>2.  Second Degree Work</p>
<p>Agriculture: Promote rural governance, practice group defense, improve agricultural products, and equalize land rights. Industry: Formulate labor laws and regulations, implement worker education, and improve the manufacturing of domestic goods.</p>
<p>Commerce: Sever economic ties with Japan and focus on honest transactions.</p>
<p>Learning: Focus on academic research, raise moral standards, implement physical training, and participate in practical work.</p>
<p>Soldiers: Born to die, deeply understand the righteousness, not greedy for merit, not discouraged. Officials: Do not take a single thing from the people, do not waste a single penny of public money.</p>
<p>Women: Save money and food, and go to the national crisis together.</p>

<p>— Zi Wei</p>
<p>"Zheng Zhengqiu and Hu Die take the stage"</p>
<p>Autumn Butterfly is not a butterfly in autumn, but two famous figures in the art world.</p>
<p>Mr. Zheng Zhengqiu is a pioneer in performing vernacular dramas and a famous director of the Star Film Company. His words have long been praised by the general public.</p>
<p>Ms. Hu Die has been publicly honored as the Film Queen. In the Chinese film industry, she is definitely a modern girl who has no equal. There are too many people who care about and are fascinated by her.</p>
<p>Now, these two will cooperate in the Mid-Autumn Festival to perform a newly compiled vernacular drama in response to the times. The name is "The Substitute Wife." You think: this is really going to make people happy, because Zheng has not been on stage for a long time. As for Hu Die, her beautiful face and charming voice on the screen have long made people itchy and itchy in their ears, wishing to see her.</p>

<p>— Gan Yi</p>
<p>Chen Sanli</p>
<p>Chen Sanli's fame as a poet is known throughout the world, and his prose is also the same. His poems have the charm of the Tang and Song dynasties, and his prose follows the style of Fang and Yao, matching Ma Qichang. His style name is Boyan, and he is from Yining, Jiangxi. He served as a principal of the Ministry of Personnel after passing the imperial examination. During the Wuxu coup, his father, Douzhen, was the governor of Hunan. He accompanied his parents in Changsha and participated in the new policies. He often discussed reforms with the investigating censor Huang Gongdu (Zunxian) and the education envoy Xu Yanfu (Renqing). Therefore, the political affairs of a province were implicitly in Chen Sanli's hands, and his father firmly believed in him. When the matter failed, Douzhen was dismissed, and Chen Sanli was stripped of his official position and never used again. Later, he was elected by his fellow villagers as the general manager of the Nanxun Railway. Chen Sanli was upright and impatient with the drama, so he resigned. He paid taxes on a house in Baimen and entertained himself with poetry in his old age. Jiang Governor Duan Wuqiao (Fang) always liked to be close to famous scholars, especially valuing Chen Sanli's character. He invited him to his staff and was about to recommend him to the court. Chen Sanli showed his unwillingness, acting with lonely loyalty, unparalleled at the time. This year he is eighty years old, lying high in Kuanglu. Even the slightest correspondence is rarely shared with others, and his淡曠 is very similar to the people of the Wei and Jin dynasties. As the Japanese bandits are rampant, the government has formed a national crisis meeting, including Chen Sanli. The authorities have written his name in large characters in the newspapers and invited him to receive the certificate. Alas! This is because they do not know Chen Sanli's ambition. Chen Sanli is devoted to the mountains and rivers, not seeking fame in the late Qing Dynasty, not happy to rely on the Hongxian Dynasty, not participating in conspiracies during the Restoration, and not wanting to criticize the warlords in the autumn. To say that he would come out into the world during the heyday of party rule, I do not believe it. He has written several volumes of "Sanyuan Jingshe Poems," and the world calls him the Sanyuan Elder.</p>

<p>This is truly an opportunity. The Central Grand Theater on the Mid-Autumn Festival will be packed again. It is said that the newly published "Good News" is preparing a special issue for "The Substitute Wife."</p>

<p>— A Jie</p>
<p>"Good Noun? Bad Noun?"</p>
<p>In the Chinese dictionary, the word "group" is the most auspicious noun: like the attainment of cohabitation love between two sexes, it is called reunion: a rich friend is called a "round-faced rich man." The ancients said: "On the fifteenth day of August, the daughter returns to Ning, and on that day she returns to her husband's house, which is called the Reunion Festival." In the Qing Dynasty, it was customary for officials to congratulate each other during festivals and celebrate together, which was called "group worship." Isn't the word "group" an auspicious noun? What else is "團花" "good flowers and full moon" which is not auspicious: therefore, it is customary in society to eat rice balls and golden balls during the Spring and Autumn festivals and celebrations, isn't it to take the beautiful meaning of reunion? Now, everything is really upside down. Since the establishment of the "Blood Soul Elimination Group," what "Iron Blood Elimination Group," "Conscience Elimination Group," "Hot Blood Punishment Group," "Thunderbolt Killing Group," "Blood Drip Shoveling Group":::: etc., someone has counted that there are more than sixty groups in total. The round-faced evil merchants, upon hearing the word "group," are all panic-stricken, their hearts and livers chilled, just like the Wuxi people's "spinning around." Newspaper advertisements and notices are a complete mess. Alas! In the eyes of evil merchants, isn't this group the most hateful bad noun?</p>

<p>— Jiang Hongjiao</p>

<p>Mr. Wang spoke these few words, then opened the door and left. Just as he was about to open the door, Fenruo once again urged him that if he went to the meeting place, he must not reveal that Regiment Commander Yuan was at her house.</p>
<p>"The meeting place is buzzing with discussion, because they can't find the commander anywhere. Which road did the commander come from, how is it that no one in the town saw him? Ah! Today, the whole town is welcoming the commander like mad. It's a pity that this sister-in-law is unable to attend because she is taking care of the madman upstairs." Mr. Wang said this to Regiment Commander Yuan again before leaving.</p>
<p>"Okay! You go first, I want to go upstairs and see the patient, and then I'll go to the meeting." Regiment Commander Yuan's intention was to urge Mr. Wang to leave quickly, but he had many words in his heart that he wanted to carefully and intimately discuss with Fenruo.</p>
<p>"Then, goodbye, Commander! You must comfort that madman well. It's a pity that besides this sister-in-law, everyone here hates and dislikes him. He also has the surname Yuan, perhaps he's a relative of the commander's:::" Mr. Wang still hesitated slowly.</p>
<p>"Mr. Wang, if you go to the meeting place immediately, you might meet Dr. Zhang, so please notify him that after the meeting, he must come here to give him an injection. Mr. Wang, please do me the favor!" Fenruo said, and then opened the door and very politely saw Mr. Wang out. In reality, these few words were equivalent to issuing an eviction notice. Mr. Wang also felt that there was no point in lingering any longer. However, after Mr. Wang left Fenruo's door, he was very disappointed and full of suspicion. He wondered why he had never heard them mention any relationship with Regiment Commander Yuan. Regiment Commander Yuan had never been here before or after the war? It's true that the madman Yuan is a Yuan, and the commander's surname is also Yuan, and the madman, when he was mad, said that Regiment Commander Yuan was her husband. Could this be true? If they are husband and wife, how could Regiment Commander Yuan leave her here and not care about her at all? If it's true, Fenruo must have a close relationship with the Yuan family, no doubt. Fenruo is a widow, perhaps she has some kind of ambiguous relationship with Regiment Commander Yuan? That would make me disappointed. How can a poor merchant like me compare with a rich and noble commander? But, if Fenruo really has an ambiguous relationship with the commander, how could she be so poor? If there is no ambiguous relationship, why would she immediately want to rush me out now, and Fenruo looks very flustered, which is very suspicious.</p>
<p>The more Mr. Wang thought about it, the more jealous he became of Regiment Commander Yuan, and he also resented You Fenruo. He was plotting to reveal this secret at the meeting place, at least to sweep the commander's reputation and prestige to the ground. But then he thought again, and he became timid. He negotiated with himself. He is a military man, no matter what, I can't fight him. If he wants to act rashly and pull out his pistol, I'm a sacrifice. If he wants to act civilly, he'll use some excuse to arrest me, say I'm a Communist, and sentence me to death. I have no way to appeal my injustice. In any case, I can't offend him.</p>
<p>He slowly walked step by step to his house, and did not go to the meeting place. He was very sad, very indignant, and very annoyed, but he dared not make a decision.</p>

<p>The Yarn Exchange will be closed for one day on the Mid-Autumn Festival, September 15</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market situation has turned firm. After the big drop in American cotton, it has now entered a stable state, causing general profit-takers to cover their positions. Most people's psychology is still so-so, because the actual needs of the customer groups are not smooth, and the situation is still flat, but the bulls and bears are fighting hard.</p>
<p>The standard rose one tael three this month: The opening of the Renbiao pre-market was due to the slight rise in American cotton and short covering. The market price rose from 8.9 qian to 1.2 taels, but the bulls of Rongxing Hao still did not let up. The market was flat in the afternoon. The total turnover for the whole day was 19,450 bales. The statistics showed that Tongfu sold 700 bales, Mingde 1,000 bales, Ruida 500 bales, Dafeng 700 bales, and Shenji 700 bales. Hengyi bought 800 bales, Changfeng 1,400 bales, Yichang 900 bales, Shenji 700 bales, Lichang 650 bales, and Long 450 bales. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<h3 id="e117">The Cotton Market Slightly Increased <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market rose slightly because the American cotton situation was more stable and fewer new products were being sold. However, some believe that the weather is good, and the tendency of new cotton shipments to surge is also causing many people to sell short. However, the spot cotton situation in the market is still tight, and all factories have an appetite, so the overall situation can still be calm.</p>
<p>The Zheng Biao Was Only Better By Two or Three Qian: The opening of the Zheng Biao pre-market, due to the stable American cotton, the market sentiment for all months turned upward, and the market was firm across the board. All months rose by two or three qian. In the afternoon, the near months fell by one qian, and the far months rose by five to one qian. The total turnover for the whole day was 63,000 dan. The statistics showed that Yukang sold 2,500 dan, Taichang 1,800 dan, Tongxing 1,100 dan, Xingchang 1,600 dan, and Yuanda 1,300 dan. Gengfeng bought 3,100 dan, Rongxing 2,000 dan, Yifeng 1,200 dan, and Yuchang 2,500 dan. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>

<p>Bombay: Last week's arrivals were crowded, and Japanese merchants' sales exceeded purchases, so the situation was particularly unfavorable. The weather in the cotton-producing areas was generally favorable. White Luo Xi, Ge Ju La Gandhi Xu, and Pilaer West all benefited from rain. The harvest situation in the Central Provinces and Central India is all above the average of 70%. The Oomra harvest is delayed by four weeks, so movement will begin in the next two months. Since the Oomra harvest last year was poor, the factory's inventory was not abundant, but this year it will gradually increase. The attached statistics for last week are as follows (unit: thousand bales):</p>
<p>1931 1932 Accumulated Receipts from September 1st 8 49 Weekend Inventory 315 756 Accumulated Exports from September 1st 25 36 Exports to Europe 10 4 Exports to China 3 1 Exports to Japan 10 32 Other Regions 2 1</p>
<p>Liverpool: Spot sales were quiet at the beginning of the week, and slightly stronger later. In terms of futures, they were very firm at the beginning. After the US cotton government report was published, which was favorable to short positions, market prices fell sharply. However, people's hearts were still good, thinking that the current price drop was temporary. The weekend's rise was due to good news from Alexandria. Egyptian cotton initially fell slightly with American cotton, but then rose due to cotton harvest reports being detrimental.</p>

<p>South Shanghai: Yesterday's rice situation, the source of each group was limited. The new Yangjian Jiaobaijian and other two types were the healthiest in this street's sales market. The market price suddenly rose by two or three jiao. The arrival and sale of new japonica rice were flat, and the price did not rise or fall. Changxi Beipo and Bo Dao had no appetite at all, and the price was about two jiao lower.</p>
<p>Xinzha: Yesterday's source of Western Road was more than twenty. Because the old lunar Mid-Autumn Festival had arrived, the going out road was extremely light. The middle pass Chen Po was reduced by two or three jiao. Early and late rice were moderately soft by two jiao. New japonica rice and Xinluyangjian were scarce and continued to be firm, and the value had no glory or disgrace.</p>

<p>Foreign Rice Had a Way Out to the North</p>
<p>Yesterday, the northern gang continued to have an appetite for foreign rice, and this street also inquired a little. However, the new japonica rice and new jian from the river were gradually arriving vigorously. This street had no intention of vigorously selling foreign rice. Yesterday, only a small number of Saigon rice was handled. Small ground rice was handled by the Northern Ocean Yantai gang for 1,000 bags, but the cargo owner had a very firm mind because he could put aside the import declaration before the end of the year, and did not want to sell it lightly. The selling price of Saigon rice turned around. The overall market opened with 500 bags of Saigon No. 1 rice, priced at 9 yuan 4 jiao 2 fen to 2 jiao. 1,200 bags of small ground rice, priced at 8 yuan 6 jiao to 7 jiao. In the past month, passenger yuan rice has gradually arrived from Jiangxi, Hunan and other places. Due to being squeezed by the He Xia Du Yuan, there has been no opportunity for smooth sales. Currently, the stock has more than 1,000 bags of Jiangxi machine yuan, and hundreds of bags of Hunan machine yuan. Yesterday, 300 bags of Jiangxi machine yuan were sold, priced at 13 yuan 9 jiao to 13 yuan 3 jiao, and 40 bags of Hunan machine yuan, priced at 13 yuan.</p>

<p>The Flour Market Only Looks Flat and Weak</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after the opening in the morning and afternoon, each month generally showed a flat and weak trend. Because the quoted price of foreign wheat was again about 2 jiao lower, people's hearts inside and outside the industry inevitably felt weak. However, the factory's output was still not smooth. Only Fufeng had a slight output, and the rest did not move. Moreover, Fuxin's quota for this month was said to have been drawn by the fixed customers one after another. If the customer gang draws and buys, they will change to drawing from October, (it is heard that the Tianjin gang has drawn 2,000 bags, and the price follows the October standard). As a result, although the environment is not good, people's hearts are good. However, rice prices are getting lower and lower, and foreign wheat can still be inquired about. In terms of the going trend, it is actually looking flat and weak. As a result, this month was smaller than the previous week by 2.5 li, October was smaller by 5 li, November was smaller by 7.5 li, December was smaller by 5 li, January was smaller by 2.5 li, and February was smaller by 5 li.</p>
<h3 id="e122">The Wheat Market is on a Stable Road <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market, after opening in the morning and afternoon, each month generally showed a stable trend. Because the foreign wheat continued to report about 2 jiao lower, this year's enthusiasm for business among the industry players was not as strong as in previous years. They only inquired about foreign wheat, but there were no actual transactions. Moreover, this wheat is in the time of falling orders. If there is no real cargo from the inland to hedge, the quota will naturally feel lacking. After a small number of floating more bought in, the market sentiment turned good. As a result, September was greater than the previous week by 2 fen, October to December were greater by 3 fen, January was unchanged, and February was greater by 2 fen. The spot wheat market is still stable. The opening price for Yaowan wheat was 3 taels 6 qian, Gaoyou wheat 3 taels 4 qian, and Yangzhou wheat 3 taels 4 qian 2 fen, totaling 940 bags, which were handled by Shen Da Huafeng.</p>

Goods are scarce and in tight supply, and although there are calls for price increases, buyers have not yet complied.</p>

<p>Dried Lily Flowers Rise Again and Again ▲ Xiang Lian Stabilizes</p>
<p>Recently, with the arrival and storage of dried lily buds failing to meet demand, prices have gradually risen, and local prices have also risen accordingly. Yesterday, the numbered firms' asking price rose again to 14 taels and a half to 14 taels, an increase of 6 or 7 maces compared to the previous day. At the same time, sales have also increased.

Here, Hengzhou lotus seeds are selling for 54 taels, and Jiuxi lotus seeds are out of stock and selling for 55 taels. However, the local price of white lotus seeds has fallen, with the current leading firm selling white lotus seeds for 40 taels. The market may need to continue to ease. (Chicken Heart Village) The first batch of new goods, according to telegrams, has already arrived in Hankou, with the quoted price opening at 9 taels, and the price for submitting to Shanghai needing to be in the range of 10 taels and a half.

<p>Yesterday, the foreign firms' silk market was increasingly quiet. Because the price of Chinese silk in places like New York was affected by Japanese silk lowering prices to compete for sales, all reported sharp declines. Overseas silk telegrams did not turn yesterday. Market sentiment was sluggish. Only Xinfu imported ten bales of Shanghai white factory silk, grades 13 to 15, of the Three Dancing Girls brand, at a price of 705 taels, and Qianli imported thirty bales of top-grade number two Qilibai dried raw silk of the Lin Ma brand, at a price of 580 taels.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the selected tender tea buds, from Wuyuan, Tunxi and other places, and green tea, the British firms Baochang Foreign Firm and China Tea Company all reopened because of active European sales. Ordinary firm goods, Yihuo, Xiehe and other firms, also had transactions. The tea bud market was slightly active, but the selling price was 6 or 7 taels lower. The market for needle buds, show buds and other items was stable. Although the Russian Assistance Society had sporadic negotiations regarding Gongxi green tea, the recognized price was too low, and the selection was strict, and there were no large transactions, it is said.</p>

<p>Hui Si Iron Sales Gradually Stir</p>
<p>Since the sharp drop in the price of authentic brand English tinplate, the standard of Hui Si iron has plummeted. Until recently, English tinplate has begun to rise, but the trend of Hui Si iron still has a downward trend. Although customer merchants have shown slight activity in the future of transactions, canneries, tobacco companies, etc. on this street are still purchasing, so the market is not vibrant. The estimated price of old steel factory goods is 22 taels and 5 maces, and the opening price of new steel factory goods is 21 taels and 5 maces. It is said that in the past two days, merchants from Qingdao, Tianjin, Yantai and other places have purchased over a hundred boxes, and the price is still 2 maces and a half cheaper, with new steel factory goods at 21 taels and 2 maces and a half, and old steel factory goods at 22 taels and 2 maces and a half.</p>

<h3 id="e130">After the Japanese Seizure of Salt Tax in the East Provinces, Minister Song Still Maintains Foreign Debt Credit <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Please Pay Attention to the Serious Situation from Various Governments</p>
<p>Payment of Principal and Interest Due by Salt Affairs Audit Office</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency reports that, according to Finance Minister Song Ziwen's announcement, today's newspapers reported foreign affairs regarding the Japanese seizing salt taxes, sending notes to the United States, Britain, and France, the content of which is quite inaccurate. According to external sources, the same type of note, along with supporting attachments, was sent separately to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France, notifying them that since the Eastern Three Provinces were seized by the Japanese in April, no funds have been remitted to pay off the foreign debt funds secured by salt taxes. The total amount of foreign debt funds seized by the Japanese, as of August 31, is approximately 1,746,100 yuan. The note stated that this kind of seizure of foreign debt funds is sufficient to harm the security of the foreign debts guaranteed by salt taxes, which is very obvious. It was found that in September of this year, a large amount of payment was due, and this seizure by the Japanese also harms the National Government's ability to pay other debts. Now, in view of the fact that your citizens hold bonds guaranteed by salt taxes, we ask your governments to pay attention to the serious situation caused by the seizure of the salt affairs audit offices in the Eastern Three Provinces, etc. Minister Song also denied the government's consideration of extending the payment of various amounts due in September, saying that the Salt Affairs Audit Office has already issued instructions to allocate the interest due in September, totaling 45,000 pounds for British and French foreign debts, 115,000 pounds for the Crisp Loan, and the principal due, totaling 250,000 pounds for British and French foreign debts. However, Minister Song also strongly stated the difficulty the government faces in paying debts after the Japanese seized the loan funds. At a time when the national government will continue to do its best to maintain the credit of the debts guaranteed by salt taxes, the Japanese warlords have seized funds that should belong to the bondholders for six months and refuse to release them. Moreover, when they seized the salt affairs audit offices earlier, they stated that they should at least remit the amount to be repaid as usual. Now they have immediately gone back on their word, which is extremely unfair, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Supporting the League of Nations Covenant Association Cables League of Nations Member States <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Destruction of Territorial Integrity of Member States</p>
<p>Please Advocate Unanimously Based on the Spirit of the Covenant</p>
<p>The League of Nations Covenant Support Committee, initiated by over seventy trade associations in this city, has recently heard that the number of participating trade associations has exceeded one hundred and twenty. It is actively implementing measures for economic blockade against Japan for several days. In order to awaken the attention of various countries in the world, a special cable was sent to the member states of the League of Nations, requesting unanimous economic blockade against Japan based on the spirit of the Covenant. The original cable reads: To the representatives of all member states of the League of Nations, Japan's former Minister of the Army, Nan Jiro, said to people when he went to the Eastern Three Provinces to inspect on December 20 last year, "From now on, only the issue of one regime remains. This incident is actually a revolution in Manchuria. Its purpose is to drive out the old regime." On January 6 this year, Nan Jiro arrived in Moji from the Eastern Three Provinces and said to Japanese reporters that according to the current situation in Manchuria, there should be three most important principles: one of which is the independence of Manchuria. This is because Japan suddenly occupied the Eastern Three Provinces by force and created a puppet organization, breaking away from Chinese rule. As evidenced by the remarks of the Minister of the Army, it was all created by him single-handedly. It is absolutely impossible to deceive the world with national self-determination. This action by Japan is clearly in violation of Article 10 of the League of Nations Covenant, which states, "The member states should respect and preserve the territorial integrity of all member states." Recently, it has even publicly announced its recognition of the puppet organization, which is tantamount to tearing up Article 10 of the Covenant and challenging all member states. According to Article 10 of the Covenant, if the territorial integrity of a member state is violated, the League of Nations Executive Council should plan to fulfill the method of this obligation. The intention of this article is that when the territorial integrity of a member is violated, the Executive Council should unite the strength of all members to jointly safeguard it, in other words, to jointly sanction the aggressor. For a year, the League of Nations has not taken decisive and effective measures, which is nothing more than because there are many affairs in Europe and a sanction is added, and it is feared that the dispute will expand and affect the overall situation. I do not know that today's affairs, like a person suffering from sores, are easier to heal if cut early, and fostering carbuncles will definitely cause trouble. If Japan occupies the Eastern Three Provinces and its power is consolidated in three to five years, then the Pacific War will be difficult to avoid. It is better to sanction it as soon as possible, which is easier to deal with. This is not for the sake of our country alone, but for the sake of the overall situation of the world. If the League of Nations cannot handle it strictly in accordance with the spirit of the Covenant after receiving the report of the Investigation Team, then international authority will be completely destroyed by the Japanese, and once a bad example is set, Europe will also have many affairs from now on. Therefore, the Shanghai 70-odd trade associations have initiated the formation of this association, gathering national commercial organizations, upholding the spirit of supporting the League of Nations Covenant, and based on the principle of freedom of trade for merchants, to carry out economic blockade against Japan in advance and automatically. We hope that various countries in the world will not hesitate to sympathize and provide assistance. League of Nations Covenant Support Committee Koushou.</p>

<p>Reporting on Various Domestic and Foreign Affairs Issues</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that Chairman Lin was in Shanghai and did not go out yesterday morning. In addition to receiving Mayor Wu and old friends around 9:00 a.m., he also received reporters from various news agencies near noon and reported on various domestic and foreign affairs issues that the people of the country have been paying attention to recently. Around 1:00 p.m., he went out to visit friends again and had not returned to his residence by late evening. The points discussed by Chairman Lin are recorded on the left.</p>
<p>Wang Will Go to Beijing Soon: Chairman Lin said that he had met with President Wang a few days ago and had a pleasant conversation. Mr. Wang's illness has subsided, but the fever has not completely subsided. He will return to Beijing as soon as he recovers, but there is no fixed date yet. Mr. Wang has always been responsible and will not show any negative attitude at this time of national crisis. Urge Chen to Cancel Leave: Minister of Communications Chen Mingshu visited him the morning before yesterday. He said that Chen's leave had expired, so he urged him to return to Beijing to assume his duties immediately. The reporter then asked the Chairman whether there were other important tasks to ask Chen to be responsible for. Chairman Lin replied that Chen had previously resigned from his duties to the central government, but it was not approved, so Chen will of course still be the Minister of Communications when he returns to Beijing. However, Chen has not yet indicated whether or not he can.</p>
<p>Reorganize Fujian Province: Regarding the reorganization of Fujian Province, Chairman Lin told reporters that he had not heard of this matter, and the central government has no such proposal. He has only seen this record in the newspapers recently. However, the people of Fujian Province have indeed petitioned the government to reorganize Fujian Province, and he also hopes that the government can actively rectify it so that the politics of Fujian Province can be brought on track.</p>
<p>Third Plenary Session Date: The Third Plenary Session has been decided to be postponed, because at this time of high autumn and fat horses, it is the time for the country to use troops. The government is now actively suppressing bandits, and Chairman Chiang and other central committee members are all with the army. If they rush back to attend, it may have a major impact on military affairs. Moreover, previous plenary sessions have also been postponed to March or half a year.</p>
<p>Diplomacy with Japan: The reporter then asked whether it was true that our Ambassador to Japan, Chiang, was ordered to visit the Japanese Minister of the Army and Minister of Foreign Affairs and proposed a so-called compromise, as reported in yesterday's newspapers. Chairman Lin replied that this is a diplomatic issue and can be inquired of the diplomatic authorities. However, this is a Reuters telegram and may not be completely reliable. I hope you will not trust it lightly.</p>
<p>National Participation in Politics: Regarding the progress of national participation in politics, Chairman Lin said that the draft regulations have been drafted by Mr. Wang Jingwei and others and are still being carefully reviewed. Because these regulations are related to the election of the people, the government should take a serious attitude to avoid misunderstandings in various provinces due to competitive elections.</p>
<p>Recovering Lost Territory: I believe that recovering the lost territory in the Northeast is something that the government should do, and the people should also eagerly hope that the government can announce a concrete plan and hope that the government can proceed in an orderly manner to achieve the goal. However, this plan is not only related to military affairs and cannot be announced, but also has a great impact on international relations, so although the government has made a decision, it cannot be announced lightly to comfort the people and cause unexpected disputes. As for ordering the suppression of rebels, it is originally a paper order that can be issued at any time, but all preparations are not easy, but the government should actively prepare, not be afraid of difficulties, to achieve this goal.</p>
<p>Sun Will Go North Soon: Mr. Sun Zhesheng will arrive in Shanghai on the 23rd of this month. I hope that Mr. Sun will also go to Beijing to participate in national affairs. Mr. Hu Zhantang's illness has gradually improved. It is not known whether Mr. Wu Tiyun will come to Shanghai with Sun Zhesheng.</p>
<p>Lin Will Return to Beijing Soon: After discussing various important issues, Chairman Lin further inquired in detail about the work of the reporters and sincerely exhorted them, and his words were concerned. Finally, he said that he would stay in Shanghai for three or four days and then return to Beijing. After the conversation, the reporters resigned, and Chairman Lin sent them out of the door.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Resolves on Opinions on Abolishing Taels and Changing to Yuan <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Reply by Letter After Approval by the Executive Committee</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of abolishing taels and changing to yuan, since Vice President Chen of the Central Bank, in the name of the Research Committee Chairman, proposed three points that should be studied: 1. The weight and fineness of the new silver coins; 2. The ratio of silver taels to silver coins for contracts still in effect; 3. What measures should be taken to make the general public understand and trust this change? The Municipal Chamber of Commerce and various groups were sent letters separately to solicit opinions. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce then sent letters to various trade associations and local chambers of commerce to solicit opinions widely, and organized a research committee on the issue of abolishing taels and changing to yuan to study the principles of currency system, domestic commercial conditions, and responses from various parties in detail. After several meetings, the last committee meeting was convened yesterday, and the following opinions were resolved:</p>
<p>First Question: The weight and fineness of the new coins should be determined based on the principle of not violating the following four principles. The so-called four principles are: 1. If the fineness of the currency is too high, it is easy to privately melt and destroy it; if the fineness is too low, it is easy to induce private minting. As evidenced by the precedent of currency, it is necessary to prevent the occurrence of these two malpractices when deciding on the weight and fineness. 2. The main coin is unlimited legal tender, which is different from the limited legal tender of the auxiliary coin, so the nominal price of the auxiliary coin can be higher than the actual price, while the nominal price and actual price of the main coin cannot be far apart. 3. Under the current circumstances, the government's minting of coins should not be allowed to lose money, but it should not be hoped for surplus, because once there is a surplus, hard currency can also be issued indiscriminately like soft currency, resulting in currency inflation and soaring prices. In the history of currency in our country, such precedents can be counted. 4. Changes and adjustments in regulations should be made within the possible scope so that the social and economic situation does not have drastic changes. Second Question: For silver tael contracts that are still in effect, those who fulfill their debts after the abolition of taels and the change to yuan will naturally pay new national currency, and the new value of the new national currency will be the fairest conversion ratio. Because after the abolition of taels, there is no so-called ocean cent market price, and there is no other standard for conversion other than the actual price of this national currency.</p>
<p>Third Question: In order to make society understand and trust, 1. Society should be made more convenient to use silver yuan than to use silver taels, or at least have the same convenience as silver taels. The conditions are: (A) For free minting, anyone who holds old coins, yuanbao, or silver bars, the national mint can respond to their request at any time and pay the same amount of new national currency at the announced conversion rate. (B) For freedom of transportation, the prohibitions that previously prohibited the transportation of cash out of the country and restricted the transportation of cash out of the country should not be easily promulgated by local authorities, but should be handled carefully by the Central Bank, which is responsible for regulating finance, at any time. 2. Society should be made to regard silver yuan as silver taels and have the same accurate fineness so that there is no fear of inferior coins and light coins disturbing the mind. The conditions are: (A) Recalling old coins and reminting them at any time. (B) Centralizing minting power, not only should the Hangzhou factory set up by the central government be abolished, but also the private silver yuan bureau set up by the military in Sichuan Province and the mint set up in Guangzhou should be ordered to stop with strict orders, so as not to be out of reach, or only mint hao yang and ignore it. (C) Organizing a currency system supervision committee, selecting a number of people from commercial organizations and the financial community across the country to take turns stationed in Shanghai to supervise the division of labor. Their tasks are to participate in the verification of hard currency, to announce its fineness at any time, and after the verification in Shanghai, important cities can also set up verification departments by commercial organizations to verify at any time for comparison and to facilitate credit. Secondly, participate in the public inspection of soft currency to announce its reserve ratio at any time. The main purpose of this article is to publicize the task of supervising the currency system to the whole country, and not to be set up in Shanghai, but to be the exclusive responsibility of the people of Shanghai, in order to awaken the belief of the whole country with an attitude of great justice and selflessness, so that the new currency system can be easily implemented.</p>
<p>The above opinions will be sent by the committee to the standing committee for submission to the executive committee for approval before a formal reply is sent.</p>

<p>According to the Kuo Wen News Agency, the Data Bank on Beijing Road officially announced its dissolution yesterday, and has engaged Accountant Xie Lin and Lawyer Qiu Fenling to handle the winding-up and liquidation. The reasons for the bank's dissolution and the subsequent arrangements are detailed below:</p>
<p>Established Last Year The bank was established in March of last year with a paid-up capital of 500,000 yuan. Huang Mingdao served as the general manager, and Tang Haishan as the manager, handling all banking operations. From the outset, business flourished. In the first four months of the first half of last year, profits amounted to approximately 60,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Reasons for Liquidation In addition to operating pawn loans, the bank also dealt in large quantities of government bonds. After the September 18th Incident in the Northeast, bond prices plummeted. Subsequently, with the outbreak of the January 28th Shanghai Incident, four or five out of ten of the bank's shareholders suffered losses on government bonds. Hopes for a price recovery were dashed due to the unstable situation, making it impossible to recoup losses. Although the board of directors resolved to raise new capital on August 27th of this year, various factors prevented its realization. The bank's savings deposits totaled only about 70,000 yuan, while the credit side, such as loans and pawn loans, amounted to approximately 200,000 yuan. To avoid significant losses, all the bank's shareholders reluctantly decided to cease operations and liquidate at a meeting on the 11th of this month.</p>
<p>Social Stability A reporter from the Kuo Wen News Agency, concerned that the liquidation of the Data Bank might affect the social economy, visited a prominent figure in the banking sector. According to him, the Data Bank was not a member of the Bankers Association. The bank ceased operations due to poor management and the impact of falling government bond prices. It is reported that the savings portion of the internal deposits will be repaid in full. Because the amount is not significant, it is not expected to have any impact on society.</p>
<p>Savings to be Repaid The bank closed its doors yesterday morning, with a notice posted in front stating: "Notice: As resolved by the shareholders' meeting yesterday, the bank is to be dissolved and liquidated. All savings department deposits are entrusted to the Zhengze Accounting Firm for payment (4th Floor, Dalu Department Store, Nanjing Road). Other debts are entrusted to Lawyer Qiu Fenling and Accountant Xie Lin as representatives for liquidation (5th Floor, Dalu Department Store, Nanjing Road). Data Bank Co., Ltd., September 13, 21st Year." Accountant Xie Lin also issued a notice stating: "Notice: The Data Bank is ceasing operations and liquidating. All savings department deposits, having been established with the approval of the Ministry of Finance, are being handled separately. This accountant has been entrusted to make payments of the original principal. Therefore, all depositors of the Data Bank's savings department are notified to bring their deposit passbooks to the Zhengze Accounting Firm, 4th Floor, Dalu Department Store, Nanjing Road, between 10:00 AM and 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM and 3:00 PM daily, starting from September 13th, to collect their funds."</p>
<p>Report to the Court After implementing the liquidation, Lawyer Qiu and Accountant Xie reported to the First Special District Court for record yesterday and jointly issued a liquidation notice stating: "Notice: The shareholders' meeting of Data Bank Co., Ltd. resolved to cease operations and dissolve for liquidation from September 12th. This lawyer and accountant have been entrusted as liquidators. In addition to reporting to the competent court, all depositors are hereby notified to bring their deposit passbooks to this accountant's office for registration between 9:00 AM and 11:00 AM daily starting from September 19th. Furthermore, all debts owed to the bank must be paid in full to this accountant's office by September 30th. Qiu Law Firm, 5th Floor, Dalu Department Store, Nanjing Road, Shanghai. Xie Accounting Firm, 4th Floor, Dalu Department Store, Nanjing Road, Shanghai."</p>
<p>Huang Mingdao's Illness The reporter drove to the residence of Huang Mingdao, the general manager of the bank, yesterday, but due to Huang's severe lung ailment, he was unable to receive visitors. According to his family, Huang has been unable to attend to bank affairs since the September 18th Incident last year, due to illness, and is therefore quite out of touch with current matters.</p>
<p>Accountant's Statement Accountant Xie Lin, who is handling the case, stated that the bank's capital was 500,000 yuan and it was a limited company registered with the Ministry of Industry and holding a license. Since its opening last year, business had been excellent. However, it was subsequently affected by the September 18th Incident and the Shanghai War, resulting in significant losses due to the large number of government bonds purchased. They勉强supported the business until now, but not only was the share capital completely lost, but there were also debts that could not be paid. Yesterday, the shareholders held a meeting and decided that they could not continue operations, and then they passed a resolution to dissolve the company, as well as appoint this accountant and Qiu Fenling as liquidators. They are currently taking over accounting documents, and they are scheduled to register the bank’s debts from September 19th, and collecting the issued loans at the same time to balance the bank’s income. However, the savings department deposits were originally submitted to the Ministry of Finance for independent operation, and according to the Savings Bank Rules, directors and managers must bear unlimited liability. The business has been paid by the directors, and it has been entrusted to this accountant to pay the funds at this office from the 13th, with a total of about 70,000 yuan, and an announcement was made, which will be published tomorrow.</p>
<p>Bank's Aftermath For the sake of carefulness, the bank convened an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders on September 11th, with more than 30 attendees (out of a total of about 70 shareholders), exceeding more than half of the people. The public elected Tang Mangong as the chairman, and the meeting unanimously decided to stop operations and liquidate. The bank’s house is rented, and it can be returned after cleaning up. All 30 employees were dismissed immediately after the shareholders’ meeting on the 11th, and they were given three months’ severance pay. Only a few personnel were left to handle the closure. It is reported that the bank does not owe any money to the same industry, and the amount of all credit exchanges, in addition to the thousands of dollars outside the issuance of loans and personnel, is about 20,000 yuan. After all the funds are recovered, it will be enough to pay for the various expenses, and there will be no losses.</p>

<h3 id="e138">Tonghua Steamer Runs Aground in Qizhou <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>All Crew and Passengers Stranded Without Food</p>
<p>Two Ships Dispatched to Tow</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Tonghua steamer, en route from Nanjing to Wuhan, ran aground upstream of Qizhou. The Jiangshun steamer attempted to rescue it, but was unsuccessful. Two more ships have now been dispatched to tow it. The details of the incident are as follows:</p>
<p>Circumstances of the Grounding The Tonghua steamer set sail from Nanjing on the afternoon of the 8th. On the night of the 10th, it sailed to a point ten li upstream of Qizhou. Due to the rising tide and turbulent waters, and the pilot's negligence, it entered a shoal, and the hull ran aground. The riverbed on both sides of the area is covered with thick sand and mud, and the Tonghua steamer's hull is stuck in the shoal. The captain attempted to reverse the engines, but was unable to move the vessel. He had no choice but to send a telegram requesting assistance.</p>
<p>Jiangshun's Towing The company's Jiangshun steamer, upon receiving the report, immediately sailed to the scene of the accident to tow the Tonghua. However, the grounding was too deep, and despite repeated attempts to tow the vessel, it was impossible to dislodge it. The Jiangshun then telegraphed the Shanghai office, requesting that another vessel be dispatched for rescue.</p>
<p>Food Shortages The Tonghua steamer, traveling from Nanjing to Hankou, carried only three days' worth of provisions. There were more than one hundred armed comrades among the passengers, along with the entire crew, totaling more than two hundred people. After the grounding, they expected to arrive in Hankou on the 11th, but they were unable to arrive on schedule, and the food supply was exhausted, resulting in a lack of meals. The captain, Qiang Sheng, telegraphed the Shanghai office again yesterday morning, requesting that food supplies be sent quickly to provide relief.</p>
<p>Two Ships to Rescue Upon receiving the report, the Shanghai office's shipping department director, Wang Tong, telegraphed the Hankou branch yesterday morning, ordering the Lilong steamer, which was on the Hunan route, to be immediately dispatched to Qizhou for rescue. At the same time, the Tunan steamer, which was en route from Beijing to Hankou, was also ordered to proceed to Qizhou to assist in the towing operation. As for the food needed by the Tonghua steamer, the Tunan steamer was instructed to provide supplies to prevent the crew and passengers from going hungry.</p>

<p>Letter to the Company To Whom It May Concern: We have received and read your three letters. After the investigations, regardless of anything else, we feel that we can not afford the increased telephone fees. We feel that it is important to consult about the matter. Our association held an emergency meeting yesterday, and it was felt that with regard to your company's newly revised general rules, there is an urgent need to translate them into Chinese, and publish them to the Chinese telephone users. This should be done before we research the rules again and discuss how to cooperate. The people are asked to not to cut the wires prior to the resolution, in order to avoid other disputes. Appoint Hu Fengxiang, Yu Xiji, Cao Zhigong, the three of you will go forward. We ask you to grant the connections.</p>
<p>Notice to Subscribers Notice is hereby given regarding the opposition to the increase in telephone charges. Our association has repeatedly sent letters to the company and the Chinese Taxpayers' Association, strictly requesting negotiation on file. We have now received a reply from the company, agreeing to translate the new regulations into Chinese for publication, but making no specific statement regarding the price increase. The society convened a meeting yesterday and decided to send representatives to the company immediately for serious negotiations. We will be unable to cut the wires before the issue is resolved. In the event that the company disregards reason and forcefully cuts the lines or pursues payment, subscribers should maintain a calm attitude and await the impartial resolution of the law, in order to consolidate unity and facilitate progress. This is what we hope for.</p>

Amidst the mournful sounds of the military band, eight pallbearers carried the coffin onto the Jianghua steamer, placing it in the reserved middle cabin. Tian's wife and sons, Tian Qiao, Tian Yan, and Tian Xiu, followed behind, weeping sorrowfully. After the coffin was properly placed, Tian's family members, relatives, and friends paid their respects before departing. Family members distributed two copies of the "Taiping Magazine," edited by Tian, as souvenirs. It is reported that the Jianghua steamer is scheduled to set sail for Hankou at 2:00 AM this morning (the 13th).</p>

<h3 id="e146">Social Affairs Bureau Calls Various Industries for Discussions on Promoting Factory Inspections <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Since the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau began implementing factory inspections in this city on September 1st, various industries have requested postponement due to the decline in industry and commerce after the war. The bureau has scheduled meetings with various organizations to provide detailed explanations. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Notification to Various Industries The Social Affairs Bureau notified various industrial and commercial organizations in this city yesterday, stating: "Notice is hereby given that there are many misunderstandings regarding the items that should be inspected in accordance with the law during the initial implementation of factory inspections by this bureau. As a result, many have requested postponement. Therefore, it has been specifically decided to invite various industrial and commercial organizations to provide detailed explanations at 2:00 PM on the afternoons of September 14th and 15th to dispel concerns. At that time, it is hoped that your association will send two or one representatives to the bureau on time to listen to the discussions. This notice is hereby given. Wu Xingya, Director, September 12th, 21st Year of the Republic of China."</p>
<p>Discussion Schedule At 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 14th, the Shanghai National Products Factory Association, the Machinery-Made National Products Factory Association, the China Industrial Federation, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, and the Chinese Cotton Mill Association will each send two representatives. At 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 15th, the Chinese Soap Guild, the Chinese Woolen Mill Guild, the Knitting Industry Guild, the Biscuit, Candy, and Canned Food Industry Guild, the Electrical Machinery and Silk Weaving Mill Guild, the Egg Factory Industry Guild, the Silk Factory Industry Guild, the Chinese Cigarette Industry Guild, the Mercerized Cotton Weaving Industry Guild, the Copper and Iron Machinery Industry Guild, the Flour Industry Guild, the Cosmetics Industry Guild, the Lighter and Cotton Ginning Industry Guild, the Tin Printing and Can Making Industry Guild, the Refining Industry Guild, the National Products Rubber Products Industry Guild, and the Enamelware Industry Guild will each send one representative. The location is the Social Affairs Bureau at Xiaonanmen.</p>
<p>Explanation of Doubts The Social Affairs Bureau stated yesterday regarding the initial implementation of factory inspections, which are being conducted first in the Hunan District of Shanghai, "The Factory Law is a type of national law, and it has long been implemented in various European and American countries. The first country to implement the Factory Law was the United Kingdom, which was the first country to develop industry. The significance of the Factory Law lies in eliminating the disadvantages that workers experience due to factory life. Therefore, the age of workers, working hours, wage payments, restrictions on child labor and female labor, and factory safety and sanitation equipment are all matters stipulated within the scope of the Factory Law and should be implemented gradually. The significance of the Factory Law is naturally to eliminate the disadvantages that workers experience due to factory life, but factories must not misunderstand that this law is an enemy of factories, or that it is designed to protect workers and increase their bargaining power. Because the original purpose of the Factory Law is to maintain peace between labor and management, eliminate class struggle, and enable capital to develop rationally. Therefore, the purpose of the Factory Law is not so much to protect the interests of workers, but rather to protect the interests of all people in society. If the Factory Law is intended to protect the interests of all people in society, then this law must be fully implemented before it can achieve the practical effect of protection. Otherwise, it will only be equivalent to a kind of decoration. However, when it comes to the implementation of such laws and regulations, it is not enough to simply promulgate the laws and regulations. There must be specially designated personnel who are responsible for supervision in order to seek the realization of the laws and regulations. Therefore, various countries have a factory supervision system, and China also has the establishment of factory inspectors. The establishment of factory inspectors in China is based on the Factory Inspection Law.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Correspondence Between Municipal Chamber of Commerce and Accountants Thoroughly Investigates the Progress of the Inferior Rice Case <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>After receiving a letter from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce denouncing rice merchants Shu Zhanyuan and Tongxingtai for selling large quantities of inferior rice, it immediately organized a special investigation committee and entrusted accountants Pan Lun and Xu Yongzuo to represent the chamber, along with representatives from the Miscellaneous Grains, Oil Cakes, and Bean Rice Industries Guild and the Rice Industry Guild, to begin investigating the accounts of various rice shops and stores opened by Shu Zhanyuan and Tongxingtai Rice Store to determine whether they had sold inferior rice. It is reported that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to accountants Pan and Xu yesterday, urging them to expedite the investigation. The two accountants also replied to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, reporting on the progress of the investigation. The drafts of the two letters are disclosed below so that those who are concerned about this matter may know the latest developments.</p>
<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Letter to Accountants Pan and Xu: Gentlemen, Regarding the case of Shu Zhanyuan and Tongxingtai's private sale of Japanese rice, the matters to be investigated have been entrusted to your accounting firm, together with representatives from the Miscellaneous Grains, Oil Cakes, and Bean Rice Industries Guild and the Rice Industry Guild. The Special Investigation Committee convened its second meeting on the 9th of this month to discuss Tongxingtai's letter requesting exemption from auditing their accounts and requesting approval to ship the rice stored in Yukang. It was decided that a letter should be sent to Tongxingtai instructing them to comply with the notification in this letter and submit all accounts for review before further action is taken. Another letter should be sent to accountants Pan and Xu urging them to complete the investigation of the matters to be investigated in this case as soon as possible. A letter is sent accordingly. Please investigate and expedite the process.</p>
<p>Accountants Pan and Xu's Reply to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce: Gentlemen, We have received your letter No. 786 of the General Affairs Department of the 10th of this month, and we have taken note of its contents. Since we received your commission on August 22nd of this year to audit the accounts of the rice firms and Tongtai managed by Shu Zhanyuan, together with representatives from the Bean Rice Industry and the Miscellaneous Grains and Oil Cake Industry Guilds, we immediately dispatched accountants and clerks to work all day. Except for a week-long suspension of work while waiting for your chamber to forward the accounts, we have not interrupted our work to this day. A brief report on the progress of the audit is given below. On August 22nd, after gathering with the representatives from the Bean Rice Industry and the Miscellaneous Grains and Oil Cake Industry Guilds at your chamber, we went to Rentai Three Rice Store, managed by Shu Zhanyuan, and took all the accounts to the Northern City Rice Industry Guild to begin auditing. The work continued until August 28th before it was completed. It was deemed necessary to audit the accounts of Kaitai, Santai, Rentai Company, Jitai Mountain, and Four Rice Shops, which are affiliated to Rentai Three Rice Shop, in detail. Therefore, on August 29th, we sent a letter to your chamber, asking you to inform the four shops and Tongxingtai to send all accounts and documents to your chamber immediately so that we could send staff to audit them. We subsequently received your reply No. 711 of the General Affairs Department and attached 23 books of Jitai, and 5 meetings of Santai accounts. On the 6th of this month, we received your reply No. 721 of the General Affairs Department and attached 6 books of Rentai Company accounts on file. However, Kaitai's accounts have not yet been sent by your chamber, and we do not know why. Upon further investigation, we found that the accounts of the Jitai Mountain, Santai, and Rentai Company rice shops sent by your chamber were incomplete, and no documents were sent. A portion of the accounts of the Jitai Mountain and Rentai Company rice shops has been directly requested from the two rice shops, but the accounts of Santai before March of this year are missing. According to the person in charge of the rice shop, they were lost due to the Shanghai War. Due to the above circumstances, the audit cannot be completed for the time being. We hope that your chamber will immediately inform Kaitai Rice Shop to send all the accounts so that we can complete the report as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Other districts may also be abolished at any time if necessary</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, since the resignation of Zhong Renjie, the municipal affairs committee member of Gaoqiao District, was approved, the municipal government has also abolished the municipal affairs committee office in the district. However, the citizens of the district still intend to petition the municipal government to withdraw its order, but the municipal government has not approved it. Recently, Ma Baosen and others, members of the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association, sent a letter to the association, requesting them to advocate for the restoration of the Gaoqiao Municipal Office. The standing committee of the association forwarded the situation to the municipal government. According to Yu Hongjun, secretary-general of the municipal government, the municipal government's decision to abolish the municipal party committee offices in Gaoqiao and Fahua districts is not only to save public funds but also to make it easier to handle affairs. The municipal government has now made a decision on this matter, and it is not appropriate to make any further changes. As for other districts, the municipal government believes that it may also be abolished at any time if necessary.</p>

<p>Please Thoroughly Investigate the Embezzlement of Taxes by Tax Officials</p>
<p>The Shanghai Anhui General Association telegraphed the Anhui Provincial Government yesterday: "Chairman Wu and all department heads and committee members of the Anhui Provincial Government, greetings. With this reorganization of the provincial government, all people from Anhui are sincerely praying and celebrating that capable people have been found. Because our Anhui province has suffered three times under the former chairman, the people are in dire straits, which has been abandoned by fellow villagers at home and abroad. One falls, another follows, and five years of sacrifice have led to today. The hope for relief can be seen here. Fortunately, the special duty on camp has been abolished in accordance with public opinion, while the rice surtax, which affects the people's food, still exists. However, your government may think that there is no source of funds for construction, and the people of Anhui should endure the pain for a while to wait for the completion of the road construction. But now reading the newspaper, it is reported that the Dashengguan Rice Surtax Bureau uses donation tickets with large heads and small tails. For example, the receipt of 180 yuan only fills in a 18 yuan stub. The investigators came to the province to report, and the evidence is conclusive. According to a letter from merchants in northern Anhui, all the income of the Bengbu Rice Surtax Bureau is not given large tickets at all, filling their private pockets. After reading this, we are deeply indignant. It seems that your government's so-called construction funds are completely stolen by those corrupt officials. Our people's blood and sweat cannot bear this unnecessary sacrifice, and Committee Chairman Chiang's deadline for road construction will not be completed one day. We beg your government to severely punish them according to the law in order to quell public outrage and thank the people of Anhui. We anxiously await your orders. Shanghai Anhui General Association bowing."</p>

The Party and government representatives advised that the factory should be opened first, and then the matter would be dealt with. As a result, the first demand (content not published as requested) was agreed to be implemented immediately. One remaining demand was considered difficult to handle at the moment, so there were still no concrete results.</p>

<p>Opinions Close, Hope for Resolution</p>
<p>All the employees of the sauce industry in this city, in order to fulfill their demands, specially organized the Sauce Industry Workers' Rights Protection Committee to take charge of everything. Because they could not get the understanding of the management and the management denied it in the newspaper, the rights protection committee convened a meeting to plan the final solution, and the situation was very tense. In order to take care of social peace and stability and the welfare of both labor and management, the rights protection committee first sent representatives to the Municipal Party Headquarters to petition. They were received by the upper levels, so the situation has eased. Yesterday, the association received a notice from the Sauce Garden Industry Association, calling for a labor talk to discuss peaceful resolution of understanding. The rights protection committee sent Ren Jieting, Shen Jiaju, Chen Hanzhang, and Hu Xiangfu as representatives to discuss with Chen Weiwen, Wu Yinzhi, and Zhu Yunsheng, the representatives of the management, expressing acceptance of the rights protection demands. The labor demanded that the Labor Association invite labor representatives to participate in the discussion when convening an emergency meeting, and that the Labor Association be responsible for notifying all gardens and workshops to fulfill the conditions. The opinions of both sides have become closer, and the labor strike may not expand.</p>

<p>One Side Keeps Them, One Side Takes Them Away</p>
<p>Rice Merchants Unhappy, Yan and Zhu Resign</p>
<p>The Shanghai Dou and Mi Industry Association held its autumn measuring and grading meeting in the main hall of the Cuixiu Hall of the Yimiao Temple the day before yesterday. It was said that there had been complaints from the industry during the last measuring and grading, so this measuring and grading was extra cautious, and rice merchants from the north and south were invited to the scene to supervise the grading. Before the measuring and grading, a meeting was held to discuss all the methods of measuring and grading, such as punishing any household that violated the rules and regulations, no matter what family. Yan Xiaoquan and Zhu Zixiang, the two executive committee members, were in charge of the measuring and grading. The day before yesterday, on the first day, the measures of each bank were measured and graded. Yan and Zhu found that a certain grain and two rice stores with the most prestige in Nanshi took the lead in violating the rules. At that time, the measurement and grading officer was ordered to temporarily keep the measures of the three stores, and wait for the completion of the measurement and grading before asking the public to review and decide. Then, the buddy of a certain grain store ran to tell the shopkeeper, who sent many shop buddies to rush to the scene, arguing strongly with Yan and Zhu, with a very fierce momentum, and took away the measures. Yan and Zhu tried to stop them because of their responsibility for supervising the measuring and grading, but they were surrounded and were about to use force. The rice merchants from the north and south were very unhappy because such barbarism could not be dealt with, and the executive committee members could not perform their duties in the future, and the rice merchants would also be harmed. They have asked the public association to punish the grain store severely, in order to warn other families to follow suit, and Yan and Zhu resigned from the position of executive committee member to the public association yesterday after being humiliated because they were unable to exercise their duties. It is said that the public association will hold a meeting of the north and south industries to discuss and decide on the handling methods.</p>

<h3 id="e163">Over Two Hundred Stallholders in Zhabei Oppose the Contracted Stall Fee System <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Petition the Municipal Government to Order Its Immediate Cancellation</p>
<p>According to the Ri Ri News Agency, over two hundred stallholders, including Zhou Changmao in Zhabei, submitted a petition to the Municipal Finance Bureau yesterday, stating: "Presenting a case where local tyrants contract stall fees, forcing stallholders to pay. We respectfully request your review and, on the one hand, send personnel to investigate monopolizing local tyrants, and on the other hand, order the Finance Bureau to cancel the contracted system to relieve the suffering and maintain livelihoods. Since the Shanghai Incident, stallholders have been displaced and their livelihoods have been extremely difficult. Recently, the situation has been relatively peaceful, and the city has gradually recovered, hoping for a way to make a living. Who knew that the local tyrant Yang Dexing would take this opportunity to collude with gentry and officials to contract the stall fees from the Finance Bureau. The contracted monthly fee per stall is only 2 jiao and 7 fen. All the vegetable stalls east of Dayang Bridge, west of Yuyingtang Road, south of Tanjia Bridge, and north of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, a radius of over ten li, must be set up at the Daxing Vegetable Market, and the local tyrant monopolizes it, forcing the monthly fee for vegetarian stalls upstairs to be 2 yuan and 8 jiao, the monthly fee for meat stalls downstairs to be 3 yuan and 5 jiao, and a stall base fee of 5 yuan must be paid. Then, stallholders rely on small capital to make a living, how much can they earn? How can they bear this harsh exploitation? Therefore, all the stallholders have repeatedly petitioned the Fourth District of the Public Security Bureau and Yang Dexing, requesting that in the early days of the city's recovery, small alleys and branch roads where stalls have been set up in the past should still be temporarily set up where they do not hinder traffic, so as to avoid harsh penalties and reduce monthly fees to ease the burden and facilitate business. But in the end, it was ineffective. This kind of exorbitant tax is actually more severe than floods and beasts. How can the common people bear it? If we do not request a strict investigation and cancellation of the contracted system, it will inevitably lead the hawkers to the end, and even prolong the evil power of the local tyrants. Therefore, we are forced to exhaust the situation and humbly request your review and approval for implementation. We are grateful."</p>

The police chief ordered him to be sent to the hall for care, pending identification by his family.</p>

<p>Zheng Zhengqiu and Hu Die to Perform Tomorrow</p>
<p>Zheng Zhengqiu, a veteran of the new drama scene, has been focusing on directing work since entering the film industry and has not performed on stage for a long time. This spring, as a representative of the Star Film Company's general manager, Zhang Shichuan, he went to Qingdao to participate in the opening ceremony of the Shandong Theater. At the request of the local people, he and Hu Die performed a temporarily composed satirical play, "Candidate Wife," which was highly praised. The Shanghai entertainment industry has heard of this and has repeatedly asked Mr. Zheng to make an exception and perform once in Shanghai. Mr. Zheng firmly declined, but finally agreed to perform the play at the Central Grand Theater on Sixth Avenue for two days, tomorrow and the day after. The female lead will still be played by Hu Die, while the male lead will be played by his son, Zheng Xiaoqiu. It is expected that there will be a grand scene in front of the Central Theater tomorrow and the day after.</p>
<p>Third Team of the Southern Shanghai Defense Corps Continues to Recruit Members</p>
<p>Zhu Yunsheng, captain of the Third Team of the Southern Shanghai Defense Corps, submitted a request to the Corps headquarters to recruit more members due to a large number of vacancies. Although many people have applied, the results of the tests show that six out of ten are illiterate, and few are accepted. The number of vacancies remains the same. Therefore, the recruitment of 40 voluntary members will continue to expand the strength for defense. Anyone who is literate, has a proper occupation, and volunteers to serve can register at the team's secretariat, located inside the Jianghuai Fellow-Villagers Association at the intersection of Huining Road, outside the Great South Gate.</p>

<p>National Goods Factory Association Solicits Samples and Trademarks</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factory Association sent a letter to various factories yesterday requesting them to send their trademarks and samples to the association for forwarding to Guangdong. The letter reads: "Dear Sirs, Recently, Ma Huayi, representative of the Guangdong People's National Salvation Association, came to Shanghai to investigate the seizure of goods from the Jiuji Cane Factory. Because the goods from various Shanghai factories are sold to Guangdong Province and are sometimes mistakenly seized, the association sent personnel to accompany Representative Ma to visit various factories in person to avoid misunderstandings. However, due to time constraints, they were unable to visit all the factories, which is regrettable. Now, Zhang Zilian, standing committee member of the association, is scheduled to go to Guangdong on official business on the 19th of this month. We received a telegram from Representative Ma requesting Zhang to bring all the samples and trademarks of national goods manufacturers to Guangdong for review to avoid future seizures. We are concerned about the promotion of national goods and hereby inform your factory that if you have goods sold in Guangzhou, please list the trademarks and outer carton markings separately and send them along with samples and address information to the association before the 17th of this month so that Zhang can bring them with him to avoid future seizures. This matter is of great importance to the interests of all factories. Please do not neglect it."</p>

The Yangtze River basin has clear skies, with fog in the morning and variable winds. The same is true for the coastal area south of Ma'an Island. Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in the local port was 84.9 degrees and the lowest was 63.1 degrees.

<p>Correction</p>
<p>Yesterday's report stated that Russian beggar George Latidi died of AIDS in the detention center of the Second Special District Court. Now, because the Police Department did not accept the judgment of the First Special District Court, it requested an appeal to the Third Branch of the High Court. The High Court appointed judge Guo Dezhang to handle the case and scheduled a hearing on the 23rd of this month. There were some errors. The Third Branch of the High Court appointed judge Fan Peien to handle the case and scheduled a hearing on the 22nd of this month to summon witnesses from both sides and conduct an investigation. This correction is urgently made to ensure accuracy.</p>
<p>Letter</p>
<p>Dear Editor, I have just read a news item in the "Local News" column of your newspaper dated September 12th, regarding a fraud case involving impersonating an inspector. The article stated that Lei Wenkui claimed in the Fourth Criminal Court of the Special District Court that he had obtained a position as an inspector at the Fisheries Administration Bureau, and Dong Bin also claimed to be an inspector on a boat of the Fisheries Administration Bureau. This is shocking. After investigation, there is no position of "inspector" under the jurisdiction of this bureau, nor has Lei Wenkui or Dong Bin been appointed as inspectors. The two criminals dared to borrow the name to carry out their fraudulent tricks, which is extremely illegal. In addition to sending a letter to the Special District Court requesting that they be severely punished in accordance with the law to deter others, we hereby request that you investigate and make a correction to uphold public justice. Sincerely, Jiangzhe District Marine Fisheries Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, September 16th.</p>
<p>Dear Editor, I have just read a news item on the fourth page of your newspaper dated September 12th, 1932, regarding the Women's Relief Association reorganizing its affairs. My name is listed in the article. I formally resigned from the Municipal Party Department and the Women's Relief Association in November 1932, and my resignation was approved at that time, and I was relieved of my concurrent duties. Since Xiaoying has resigned, she has no right to interfere. Your newspaper's publication of my name is inconsistent with the facts. Please make a correction. Wang Xiaoying respectfully submits, September 12th.</p>
<p>Editor, In the news column of your newspaper dated the 12th of this month, there was a report about two nephews accusing their uncle of embezzling property, namely Wenrong et al. suing their uncle Yuchen for embezzling public property. The facts described in the report needlessly involve family matters and are quite painful. There is an unavoidable bitter reason for the lawsuit that has now occurred, but this is a minor matter of property infringement between individuals and is not important news. We hope that you will publish this in the "Letters to the Editor" column. Xu Wenrong and Xu Wenxin respectfully submit.</p>

<p>Empty Words and Shadows by Yan Xuying</p>
<p>Buddha</p>
<p>Tea houses are called "Little Dharma Halls" because tea drinkers never get involved in anything, so their criticisms are relatively fair. However, the situation in Shanghai's tea houses is different. Suppose two parties want to go to a tea house to "drink tea and talk," they must first invite several tycoons and a few thugs. If you get a tycoon to help, you can save face even if your reasons are insufficient. Otherwise, even if your reasons are perfectly valid, you will be defeated. It is a dream to expect the gentlemen invited to drink tea to come out and say a few fair words.</p>
<p>The League of Nations is like a tea house, and China and Japan are like friends of parties A and B drinking tea and talking. Now, party A is unable to resist on its own and cannot get a tycoon to help. It is futile to rely on a few tea-drinking gentlemen to come out and "right the wrongs" and say a few fair words. Even if there are a few who come out to uphold justice, but party B's attitude is tough and unwilling to listen, it is just empty talk and will never be effective.</p>
<p>According to a London dispatch yesterday, the Observer's commentary stated that in recent days, there has been much speculation about the Lytton Report. "A clever diplomat will surely intend to give Japan substance and China shadows." Originally, in any matter, if you are unwilling to shed some sweat and blood and unwilling to sacrifice yourself, but only hope that others will sacrifice and only hope that others will uphold justice, there is no such principle in the world.</p>
<p>What is a shadow? A shadow is something that is intangible and cannot be grasped. Tell me, what is the use of emptiness without a real impression when the reality is gone? A child is beaten and cries. An adult comes out from the side and says, "Don't cry, go back home. I'll get revenge for you. I'll beat him up." The child cries and goes home. The impression in his mind is still that an adult will help him.</p>
<p>Autumn Feelings in Literature and Art by Wu Xiaofen</p>
<p>The west wind brings sorrow to Jiangnan, turning back to a world unbearable,</p>
<p>The officials of Taiwan Province have a corpse-like air, singing and dancing in peace are drunken dreams,</p>
<p>The willow camp is filled with charming butterflies at night, military reports from the border enter the wild silkworms,</p>
<p>Hearing that there are many heroes in the Central Plains, how can they bear to see the barbarian horses trampling freely?</p>
<p>:::::::</p>
<p>Looking north to the snowy Heishui Riverhead, the endless mountains and rivers bring thousands of sorrows,</p>
<p>Tianyuan committed suicide by slitting his throat to uphold righteousness, Ma Yuan vowed to eliminate enemies by wrapping his body in horsehide,</p>
<p>The dying fish in the pot sigh at the sound of the horn, the child emperor bows in new clothes,</p>
<p>A rainstorm over the vast river silences the cicadas, the branches fall and cannot bear the autumn.</p>
<p>:::::::</p>
<p>Spring drums shook like thunder, gathering thousands of families, leaving ruins and decay,</p>
<p>The Xia Pu water jug empties the morale of the scholars, the Nanjing simple quilt covers all the heroes,</p>
<p>The storm invades the strong grass, the barbarian's breath dwindles, the fog chills the desolate streets, and ghosts wail in sorrow,</p>
<p>The banana trees in the old courtyard are as green as before, the broken doors lock in the cold ashes day after day.</p>

<p>Scientific Charcoal Manufacturing Method by Tian Lan</p>
<p>In the electric current, charcoal is most needed. Our country buys it from foreign countries every year, and a considerable amount of money flows out. Moreover, most of the charcoal sold on the market is foreign goods. If we do not engage in manufacturing, how can we stop this leakage?</p>
<p>The ordinary charcoal manufacturing method is extremely simple. As long as you have a little knowledge, you can manufacture it according to the law, and the capital is small and the profit is large. With a small capital of one or two thousand gold, you can start a small charcoal factory.</p>
<p>The main raw materials of charcoal are coke dust, coke, flour, sugar water, and clean water. These four things are not expensive, so making charcoal is sure to make money.</p>
<p>When making it, choose pure coke dust, pound it into an extremely fine powder with a pestle, sieve it with a fine sieve, add one-eighth or one-sixth of dry flour, mix it evenly, and adjust it with suitable light sugar water. Seal it for two or three hours to prevent moisture from escaping. After the charcoal powder is thoroughly moistened, use a mold to make charcoal sheets and charcoal strips.</p>
<p>Then move these charcoal sheets and charcoal strips to the stove and bake them with a low fire to gradually dry them. Gradually increase the heat from time to time. Once they are completely dry, put them in an iron box, cover them with a layer of coke dust to prevent exposure to the air, and let them burn naturally.</p>
<p>Then move them to a cool place, wait for them to cool thoroughly, take them out, add sugar juice, and boil them in water for 30 minutes. Then dry them in the same way as before. After burning and refining two or three times, the sheets and strips are firm and become usable charcoal. However, it is slightly inferior to machine-made charcoal.</p>
<p>Social Improvement Discussion Group: My Observation of Early Marriage by A Yan</p>
<p>Is early marriage harmful?</p>
<p>Zeng Kan has published articles on early marriage by Huanhua and Wenbing successively. Huanhua focuses on explaining the evils of early marriage; Wenbing focuses on analyzing the causes of early marriage and its remedial measures. My personal opinion is not entirely the same as theirs. I believe that there is indeed a phenomenon of early marriage in China today, but the so-called early marriage is no longer a problem. Early marriage may cause some evils in certain respects, but it is relative rather than absolute.</p>
<p>Wenbing's observation of the causes of early marriage is very clear, and my meaning is roughly the same as his. The occurrence of the phenomenon of early marriage in China is primarily based on the family system left over from feudal society. Second, the widespread phenomenon of early marriage mostly occurs in self-sufficient agricultural societies and in times when it is relatively easy to make a living.</p>
<p>However, due to the shift in trends, these explanations can no longer be applied to recent times. Although family organizations are still struggling, these organizations will be washed away by the new torrent. In the vast rural society, except for a very small number of landlords and rich peasants, most are living in bankruptcy and displacement, and they have no time to take care of themselves, let alone talk about early marriage. Similarly, in cities, the middle and upper classes have the ability to marry early, but because their sons have received modern education, they are obsessed with so-called free love. Parents have long lost their control over marriage. The urban proletariat lives in instability and has no possibility of early marriage. In this way, even if there are still some exceptional cases of early marriage at present, the phenomenon of early marriage is gradually declining, and the so-called early marriage is no longer a problem.</p>
<p>The objective environment has reduced the phenomenon of early marriage among the Chinese people. But we cannot deny that there is still a phenomenon of early marriage in poor and remote cities and towns, especially in the social strata of farmers and small farmers and above. Here we might as well discuss whether early marriage itself has any evils, and what is the degree of evils?</p>
<p>Most people think that early marriage is the biggest loss in terms of physical fitness, but that is not entirely true. The main thing is to see how well the person concerned has developed. Some people think that early marriage can remedy the problem of youth masturbation. Most young men and women over the age of fifteen have committed this illegal problem. (The results of the examination of the dormitories in Jiangsu Zhenzhong show that more than 70% of the quilts have traces of sperm.) Rather than illegal ejaculation, if the environment permits, it is better to marry early.</p>
<p>Secondly, some people worry about the economic problems after early marriage. In my opinion, this is not a problem, because fundamentally, the occurrence of early marriage depends on his own economic environment. If the economic environment permits, nothing will be a problem. People who have concerns about economic childbirth have no possibility of early marriage. In small and medium-sized farmer families, they believe that getting their children married early not only does not have economic concerns, but can also get workers who do not need wages, and marrying a daughter-in-law will increase their production.</p>
<p>So my conclusion is:</p>
<p>The phenomenon of early marriage rises and falls with social changes. Early marriage is gradually decreasing at present, and the so-called early marriage will no longer be a problem in the future. We don't have to say for sure that early marriage is not good, but we don't have to advocate early marriage. In the future, the union of the sexes can be left to nature.</p>
<p>Why the Slave of Love by Wu</p>
<p>My wife is the same every day. After lunch, she goes to the hospital to visit her close friend Suxin, and Suxin also waits eagerly for my wife's arrival after lunch every day. Obviously, they have been firmly connected by a solemn friendship and have deepened the interest in life.</p>
<p>But today my wife came back with a heavy sorrow, which surprised me very much, so I asked her in a low voice, and she said:</p>
<p>"Alas! I think it's really boring to be a woman. What's the meaning of someone like Suxin?</p>
<p>When I approached her bed today, she was talking with her fourteen-year-old younger sister with tears in their eyes. Of course, I suddenly felt that there must be a major misfortune between them, but I had to sit down silently, in order to find a way to comfort her with a quiet attitude. Sure enough, when her sister left, she held my hands tightly, and tears fell one after another.</p>
<p>"Do you know, there is really no one in the world more miserable than me." She cried and said: "Just now my younger sister told me that my husband actually stayed in my house for two nights with a woman I didn't know, and also gave her a cheongsam I had just made not long ago."</p>
<p>At this time, her throat seemed to be blocked by a stone, and she couldn't say anything more. So I quickly comforted her and said:</p>
<p>"Suxin! Don't worry, for your lovely children, for your postpartum body, be more optimistic. At the same time, this may be a temporary mistake of your husband's, and he will definitely change in the future."</p>
<p>After that, she continued sobbing and said:</p>
<p>"No, you have overestimated him too much, he will definitely not regret it. You know him completely. You know that I have been married to him for four years, and for three years he has not taken care of the family affairs at all, even though he is always idle at home. Of course, for the sake of life, I have to continue to be my elementary school teacher, maintain myself, maintain the family, and also support him in smoking and playing cards. Of course, I don't hope to ask my husband for gratitude for this, but I never thought that when I was in confinement, he would have the heart to make friends with other women and have carnal relations. This is an extremely fierce blow to me."</p>
<p>"But," I said, "you should think like this: We can give him a chance, because some men sometimes do things they don't want to do. If you can move him with such pure love, even if he has an iron heart, he will one day be grateful to you."</p>
<p>After that, she said again:</p>
<p>"He doesn't want to do anything, he's just too lazy, if I don't work he will starve to death. Of course, I absolutely don't want to depend on my husband for life, as long as I have a glimmer of hope. However, the little money I earn with hard work, if he can use it very sparingly, it doesn't matter, but every day he either plays at the Great World or brings many people to my house to play cards, so when I come back from teaching, I still have to cook for them, which is extremely tiring. At the same time, he still has a wife before, and now they still come and go often, calling her 'Eighth Sister' in a disgusting way. Do you think it's so meaningless for me to suffer like this!"</p>
<p>Then I asked:</p>
<p>"Why did he want to marry you when he already had a wife?"</p>
<p>"They're divorced."</p>
<p>"Then why do they still come and go so affectionately?"</p>
<p>"Only God knows."</p>
<p>We talked for a long time, and I really felt bad for her. At the same time, she told me that she had resigned from the original elementary school because of giving birth to a child, and now she is going to work as a proofreader at XX News through a friend's introduction, even before she is a month postpartum. I think this is so unsuitable for a postpartum body, but what can I do? Therefore, a woman like her is really a slave to her husband!"</p>
<p>My wife was still sighing endlessly after she finished speaking, and I was also silent.</p>
<p>School Photo: Girls Talk About Exam Secrets by Jun</p>
<p>One Sunday after lunch, at about one o'clock, I happened to be at my relative's house, lying on a rattan chair and reading the newspaper when I suddenly heard a giggle at the door. The roommate ran to the patio and asked, "Who are you, who are you?" (The door opener was Miss Luo, the second landlord's daughter.) It turned out to be "Miss" Liang, whom I hadn't seen for a long time. "Hello," "Hello," we exchanged greetings and went to the living room. "Please sit down, please sit down," while offering tea, "Thank you."</p>
<p>"Miss" Luo: I specially came today to invite you to register at XX School on XX Road, XX Bridge. How about you and I study at the same school?</p>
<p>"Liang" said: It is said that this school has perfect equipment, and the principal and professors are very diligent.</p>
<p>Luo said, "Miss" Liang: I am not changing schools, I will continue to study at my alma mater. Moreover, this school is very strict, so it is very good for progress, "I'm not going, I'm not going."</p>
<p>Liang said, "Miss" Luo: You and I have different hearts. I am going to transfer to XX School this time because I am too strict, but after all, I can't avoid the difficulty of the school opening.</p>
<p>Luo said, "Miss" Liang: Since you are transferring, it must have the meaning of being more perfect than your alma mater, why is there still a difficulty?</p>
<p>Liang said, "Miss" Luo: You really don't know? I'm not ashamed to tell you, one or two days before the school starts, isn't there an "exam"? When taking the exam, you have to write a composition, which is to test which grade you should be in, but I can't do it, and if I do it, I will fail. If I drop a grade, my parents will ask, and my classmates will laugh at me. Isn't that a difficult situation?</p>
<p>X said, "Miss" Liang: You are too unintelligent. If the exam is tomorrow, write a letter to the school today, just saying that Liang XX is sick at home and cannot take the exam according to the school's regulations, "Just say this and that in the letter."</p>
<p>Liang said,</p>
<h3 id="e167">Xiaoshan Kidnappers Arrested in Shanghai <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Rescued Hostage Cao A'yu</p>
<p>All Kidnappers to be Transferred</p>
<p>The kidnappers, Wang Ziqing, Li Cailang, Zhu Lixiang, and others from Shaoxing, on the 11th day of the eighth month of this year, kidnapped A'yu, the four-year-old child of Cao Zikun, a villager from Sunshui Village, Xiaoshan County, Zhejiang Province, and brought him to Shanghai. They demanded a huge ransom, initially hiding him at No. 4 Xiefeng Lane, Route Magy, and then moving to No. 12 Kangle Fang, Connaught Road, where Wang's wife, Zhou, was responsible for watching the hostage. Unexpectedly, the plan was discovered by Detective Yu A'gen of the Zhabei Police Station, who then led Detectives Liu Junqing, Wang Yingjie, Chen Yonggui, and Bao Detective Chen Xikang to arrest the three kidnappers Wang, Li, and Zhu at No. 5 Rongqing Lane, Robison Road. Accomplices Chen Miaoqian, Gao Cailang, Shen Baohe, Yang Bingwen, and others were also arrested, and the hostage Cao A'yu was rescued. Wang Zhou, who was watching the hostage, was also brought back to the police station and sent to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide held a continued hearing. The police station's lawyer, Ru BaoYi, stated that although the location of the arrest was in Shanghai, the crime scene was inland. Now, the Zhejiang Provincial Security Department has sent personnel to the case for investigative convenience and requested a transfer, which the police station does not oppose. Subsequently, Deputy Officer Shi of the Security Department submitted an official document requesting the transfer of the eight suspects, including Wang Ziqing. Judge Feng reviewed the report and ordered that the eight suspects, including Wang Ziqing, along with the hostage Cao A'yu, be handed over to the representatives of the Zhejiang Security Department to be taken back for trial.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Ye-Xu Lawsuit Temporarily Suspended <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Pending Civil Court Decision Before Resuming Trial</p>
<p>The case of Ye Lishao suing Xu JiPing for bigamy and fraud was scheduled for a continued hearing yesterday. Around 2 p.m., men and women flocked to the court to listen. In an instant, the fifth courtroom was filled. Soon after, the main characters in the case, Xu JiPing and Ye Lishao, arrived at the court one after another. Xu, accompanied by three or five female friends, sat hand-in-hand in a corner. The lawyers for both parties also took their seats. After the judge took the bench and finished hearing other cases, this case was then examined. However, although the presiding judge had previously decided in court that the lawsuit between Xu JiPing and Hu Bingheng in the civil court must be resolved before investigating Ye's accusations against Xu, the civil court dispute has not yet resumed. This case is still difficult to proceed. The presiding judge then informed both parties that the civil case was scheduled to resume on September 28th, and this case should still follow the previous decision and be heard again after the civil court's ruling. However, the lawyer for the plaintiff, Ye Lishao, requested that the facts be reviewed as the witnesses were all present. The presiding judge then informed the lawyer that, regarding the charge of bigamy, it must be proven that the defendant's other marriage was a formal union before the charge of bigamy could be established. Which union, Xu with Ye or Hu, came first, and which was the official marriage, all should be based on the civil court's decision. Therefore, this case cannot be opened for trial now. After the judge finished speaking, a written order was issued to suspend the trial proceedings. The plaintiff, the defendant, and their lawyers then left in succession, and the onlookers dispersed.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Record of Continued Hearing in Secretary Extortion Case <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Both Sides Argue, Sentencing Scheduled</p>
<p>Ouyang Hongjun, a Cantonese English secretary of the Fifth District Public Security Bureau, and Huang Hai, a Cantonese employee of the Le Yeli barber shop in the lower level of the New World on Nanjing Road, together with Huang ShengSun (a detective from the Fifth District Public Security Bureau) and others, went to the house of Xie Lu, a Cantonese woman at No. 478 Dexing Lane, Peng Road, on the evening of August 24th at 11:15 p.m. on the pretext of searching for opium and took away gold rings and cigarette cases worth 80 yuan. The case was exposed, and the two men, Huang and Ouyang, were sent by the Hongkou Police Station's Chinese and foreign detectives to the First Special District Court. The details of the successive interrogations have been reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday morning, Judge Shen Bingrong presided over a continued hearing in the Fourth Criminal Court. Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer, stated that no stolen goods, gold rings, were found during the investigation of various silver shops and pawnshops during the adjournment, and there was no other evidence. Now, Mr. Sinclair, the western district chief of the Hongkou Police Station, is present in court. The former defendant, Ouyang Hongjun, had been to the police station regarding opium matters. According to Sinclair's report, on August 24th, the former defendant Ouyang Hongjun went to the police station, spoke with Inspector Yao Hua in the office, and Yao confirmed this fact. Next, Chief Detective W. Tingle stated that on the morning of the 28th of last month, the complainant Xie Lu and her daughter, along with Chinese Detective No. 143, arrested Huang Hai at the Yi Le Ye barber shop. After Ouyang Xie (i.e., Xie Lu's daughter) pointed him out and was arrested, Huang Hai confessed that Ouyang Hongjun had jointly gone to Xie Lu's house to commit illegal acts, and Xie Lu and her daughter insisted that Ouyang Hongjun had taken away two gold rings and continued to elaborate on the details of the incident. When questioned, Ouyang Hongjun firmly stated that he had never been to Xie Lu's house at all. He said that if Huang Hai had implicated him, it was only to mitigate his own crime. Huang Hai confessed that he had gone to the Cantonese prostitute Yu Meihua in Renzhi Lane that evening, and Ouyang Hongjun and two friends also arrived after a while. Later, they went together to the victim's house to search for opium. Shortly after, he also entered, but he did not see him taking her gold rings. The court told Ouyang that as a public official, he should not frequent brothels. He was told to begin the defense. Ouyang's lawyer, Jiang Yiping, stated that the client was an overseas student, had received education, and was a secretary in the Public Security Bureau with a good salary. It was impossible that he would extort gold rings worth dozens of dollars. He asked the court to make a clear judgment and declare him innocent. Subsequently, Huang Hai's acting lawyer gave a defense. Judge Shen ordered them to be taken back into custody and scheduled a date for sentencing.</p>

<h3 id="e171">Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau Detective Team Arrests Six Criminals <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Seizes Two Live-Ammunition Handguns</p>
<p>The municipal Chinese police authorities suddenly received a tip-off the day before yesterday morning that a large number of reactionaries were planning to hide in the French Concession for secret meetings and had the intention of taking the opportunity to sneak into the Chinese area to cause trouble. The head of the Public Security Bureau, Bureau Chief Wen, did not dare to neglect this matter upon taking office. He immediately ordered the detective team leader, Lu Ying, to dispatch patrol detectives to the Nanshi and Zhabei areas to strengthen their defenses. However, at 7:20 p.m. that night, Detective Team Leader Chen Caifu was leading detectives Geng Shoubao, Fang Lingen, and You Hanwen near Beixinjing when they suddenly saw five or six people dressed in short clothes resembling workers loitering in the area, acting suspiciously. The officers immediately ordered them to stop and searched them. As a result, they found two Browning live-ammunition handguns on two of them. They immediately took the team into custody for interrogation. According to their confessions, one, Hu Lingen, a local, 19 years old, a craftsman; one, Lu MaoDa, 22 years old, local, residing at No. 6 Ruyi Lane, Chenjiadu, West Shanghai, a XinXin Flour Mill worker; one, Guan ShengLin, 33 years old, from Ningbo, residing at Xixujiage, Fahuaxiang, working; and one, Wu Xiaodi, 30 years old, local, a secondhand goods dealer, all admitted to conspiring to commit robbery. They also confessed that there was still a rifle buried in the countryside. Team Leader Lu then dispatched officers to retrieve the rifle at the address provided. At the same time, two other suspects were arrested and sent to the Judicial Section for legal action with a written report.</p>
