<p>時評</p>
<h3>正告二中全會·彬</h3>
<p>國民黨第四屆第二次中央全會。已於本月二日開幕矣。二中會究何爲而集會乎。政府昭示我人民者。不將亦曰共謀禦侮打破當前之國難乎。則我人民亦旣熟聆此言矣。自去年九一八以來。政府當局即無日不諄諄告誡我人民鎭靜忍耐。信任政府。政府終當不負國家。不負人民。一中全會更曾鄭重</p>
<p>决議。明令全國軍隊禦侮抗暴。收回失地。然紀錄之墨瀋尙新。而决議實現者究有幾何。政府當局今如重復憶起此一問題。則何若一翻一中全會之决議案。并積極促其實現否則雖再次集會。甚至百次集會。又奚益耶。</p>
<p>自去年九一八以來。我人民早已認定非以自力决死抵抗。决不足以維護我民族之生存。并决以全力爲政府之後盾。切盼政府當機而立斷。然而政府終始遷延。終以再爆發此次一二八之禍變。國難日亟。誤國者誰。政府當局果能辭其咎耶。</p>
<p>此次戰禍爆發。十九路軍孤軍抵抗。艱苦奮鬥。全國民氣奮發。莫不願爲國效死。然而苦戰經月。中央除派少數援軍外。敵軍日增。我援不至。卒使一月以</p>
<p>來光榮之戰績。幾於盡付東流。誰應負此責任。政府當局又果能辭其咎耶。土不能守。侮不能禦。决議不能實行。敵騎縱橫。山河破碎。是則朝集會。夕集會。究何爲。又奚益。</p>
<p>吾人猶記前年蔣馮隴海路一役。某西報曾刊一諷刺畫。畫中一人一手執四萬萬公債。一手持手槍。另一人。一手握麵包。一手執大刀。此種英武（？）决戰之精神。嘗爲外人所嘖嘖稱道。然而時至今日。手槍大刀。果何在耶。昔日之英武（？）今又安在耶。吾人於此次大會不欲多言。如其有之。則禦侮自衛。其最爲重要之一端也。</p>
<p>上海事件</p>
<h3>瀏河激戰我軍勝利</h3>
<p>我軍昨晨安全退出吳淞</p>
<p>大塲眞如敵軍仍圖進攻</p>
<p>各界紛電乞援迅起抵抗</p>
<p>瀏河我軍勝利</p>
<p>▲敵軍潰退回艦</p>
<p>昨午後滬某商業機關接瀏河捷訊、謂瀏河方面、我援軍上官雲相等大軍到後、即與日軍搏戰、日軍大敗、並據某交通機關消息、我軍已於四點三十八分克復瀏河、記者方慮無以證實其說、迨至晚十二時後、本館迭接到蘇州訪員發來兩電、報告瀏河敵軍潰退事、是外傳之說、已經證實、原電錄左、</p>
<p>蘇州三日下午九時半專電云、瀏河克復後、敵軍潰退茜涇、敵司令部設茜涇小學、瀏河茜涇間砲聲甚烈、太倉我軍已馳往瀏河夾擊、常熟白茜口安謐、敵機三架江晨到常熟偵察、</p>
<p>蘇州三日下午十一時專電云、瀏河酉刻來人息、該處均我軍隊、又太倉到我援軍二萬、茜涇敵已退回艦、楊林七烏二口、上午泊有敵船、</p>
<p>又據常熟傳來瀏河方面消息、昨日下午二時許、我駐防吳淞之翁照垣旅、由淞鎭撤退至瀏河、與在該處登岸之敵軍十一師團相遇、激戰至爲猛烈、適是時我援軍上官雲相師開到、前後夾擊、斃敵二千餘人、敵頑强抵抗、至昨晚八時、尙在激戰中、</p>
<h3>我軍退出吳淞</h3>
<p>▲昨日上午九時許</p>
<p>我軍爲長久抵抗、並不受敵方包圍計、故退守第二防線、以圖進可攻擊退可固守、惟吳淞方面之守軍、仍由翁照垣將軍統率一五六旅及義勇軍、據守抗戰、直至昨午、翁旅長始徇各公團代表之請求、退出吳淞、茲將所聞情形、分記如下、</p>
<p>▲敵艦進攻昨晨敵方除派大隊陸軍對我吳淞砲台陣地實行包圍外、在淞口日本砲艦、又集中火力、向吳淞口進攻、一時大砲之聲、隆隆不絕、而飛機之在吳淞砲台上盤旋拋擲炸彈、我方守兵仍沉着應戰、結果、日兵仍不支而退、</p>
<p>▲退出吳淞據守吳淞砲台之翁旅、與敵軍大小二十餘戰、日兵傷亡甚衆、而我軍仍固守陣地不退、此次十九路軍全師退守二道防線、翁旅長仍堅守不去、嗣經各公團來、向翁旅長請求保存實力、爲國宣勞、翁旅長始容納民意、遂於昨日上午九時許、下令振旅而退、日軍於我兵退離後一小時、始派兵前往、至上午十時、方易旗號、故昨日上午十時以後、進口商輪、始悉砲台改易旗幟矣、聞翁旅向瀏河退去云、</p>
<p>▲外報紀載大美晚報云、昨日（二日）午後二時三十分淞口日軍艦先以飛機偵察後、開始猛轟吳淞砲台、華軍以野戰砲機關槍來福槍回擊約一小時、日艦發砲至日暮始已、今日（三日）侵晨日海軍飛機飛過砲台區、擲下重炸彈、黎明時、日艦復以五吋口徑之砲猛轟、七時正、日驅逐艦護送三汽輪載兵駛向燈塔前海濱、同時張華浜方面有日兵六七十名駕浮橋渡薀藻浜、由南面進發之日兵、進入淞鎭時、曾受猛烈之抵抗、當兩軍交</p>
<p>戰時、大火四起、全區爲黑烟籠罩、旋日海軍陸戰隊乘小艇分四批登陸、砲台守軍發野戰砲機關槍來福槍拒之、砲彈一枚落於載日兵之淺水艇中、死傷日兵若干人、華軍數約二千名、猛抗敵軍後、以三面受圍、乃沿堤向瀏河退走、故今晨上海有華軍反攻瀏河之傳言、聞現有華軍重援由內地向瀏河進發、</p>
<h3>我軍將領通電</h3>
<p>▲一德一心共抗暴日</p>
<p>蔣光鼐等通電云、（銜略）暴日縱兵遼瀋、轉窺東南、我十九路軍奉命守土、作緊急之自衛、與之相搏於滬瀆者一月有餘矣、最初與敵之海軍陸戰隊及其初到陸軍、鏖戰二十餘日、殺傷過當、敵不得逞、而其第二批陸軍運到、我駐在蘇浙之中央直轄第五軍兩師、亦加入作戰、相持者復一旬、殲敵者又六七次、彼虜仍不得逞、最後又以其白川大將、率領兩師團來、而我始終在戰塲者僅五師、爲數不滿四萬、敵則加倍於我、至是彼虜一面以講和形色、詭商停戰、欺騙國聯、一面以一師加入正面、一師由瀏河附近登岸、襲我後路、使我腹背受敵、而我運輸困難、援師不及、不得已乃東夕奉命、將前線陣地放棄、爲戰略的撤退、再圖反攻、此我十九路軍第五軍一月以來與敵苦戰之經過情形也、夫暴日挾其旣定整個之計劃亡我、我非全國動員以極大之决心、作普遍之奮鬥、不能得最後勝利、我十九路軍與第五軍抗敵、非求一隅之勝負、與彼虜爭一日之短長、乃欲以此僅存血肉、供救國犧牲、作同胞馬前之導卒耳、自政府遷洛、已决定長期抵抗政策、我全國軍民、正當秉承此旨、一致奮起、電擊響應、此仆彼繼、勿以滬海之偏隅進退爲念、勿爲敵人分化之詭謀所中、尤望我東北同胞、啣爲虜之痛、急起遣兵、收復失地、使敵備多力分、我十九路軍第五軍當竭此未盡餘勇、與强虜作最後週旋、藉收夾擊之效、土耳其苦戰三年、卒大破希臘十五萬軍、轉敗爲勝、杜蘭斯窪一小部落耳、亦能血戰三年、不稍屈服、况我以三萬萬方里之地、四百兆人民之衆、果能全國一德一心、不能殲此跳樑小醜、吾不信也、朝鮮之亡也、猶有陸軍數萬、卒被日人解散以盡、今我國現額之兵、統計不下百餘萬、與其待國亡後供彼宰割、何如及此未亡之時、作一光榮之犧牲、此次暴日蹂躪上海多時、炸彈所至、廬舍坵墟、死亡枕藉子遺黎民、莫不同仇敵愾、不聞怨聲、此等悲壯之劇、可泣可歌、國土猶是也、人民猶是也、茍一旦主權旣失、寄生命於仇人之手、其慘狀又當何若也、惟願我全國父老兄弟、毌忘閘北江灣、全國軍事領袖毋忘朝鮮及今日之東省、暴日向國際公開宣傳、詆我謂非有組織之國家、即謂我國人不知鴿原急難、擊首而尾不動、可以各個擊破也、而我全國軍民、猶以巢幕游釜爲安、岡識鬩牆禦侮之義、忘同屋之�</p>
<p>纓寇、作鄕隣之閉戶、是誠爲見仇者所快、而爲見愛者所痛矣、我十九路軍第五軍、亦惟有收拾餘燼、背城借一、事之不濟、則拚命於沙塲、以謝我炎黃祖宗在天之靈、不願爲亡國之民也、敢曰乾時之戰、雖敗猶榮、尙幸即墨不亡、侵地終反、擐甲哀鳴、淚盡以血、惟我同胞、實昭鑒之、總指揮蔣光鼐·十九路軍長蔡廷楷·司令戴戟·第五軍長張治中·暨各師旅團長同叩、</p>
<h3>敵仍追擊我軍</h3>
<p>▲我軍當然繼續抵抗</p>
<p>大美晚報云、日第九師團之主力昨夜今晨仍緊追華軍、第十一師團之兵八千名、星期二晨在瀏河登陸後、向南進逼、已抵嘉定、現繼續前進、冀與第九師團在南翔會合、南翔已於今日正午爲日軍佔據、植田司令部現設該處、華軍現在崑山南翔間掘壕而守、聞昨夜已獲蔣鼎文與上官雲相部下由京開來之重援、如日軍續由南翔西進、則華軍得精銳之援助、繼續抵抗、頗有希望、浙省亦有兵開至滬杭鐵路一帶佈防、聞日內可抵松江云、</p>

<h3>我軍退後傷兵痛哭失聲</h3>
<p>▲足徵士氣猶存</p>
<p>金神父路法政學院內所駐傷兵、昨日聞我軍已變更戰略、放棄頭道防綫、並開始撤退至第二防綫之訊、有十餘士兵、竟痛哭失聲、謂我等出生入死、白刃肉搏、血濺原野、沙塲拼命、原冀保全國家領土、不使敵人越雷池一步、乃竟得如斯慘、果能不令人痛煞、我等欲哭無淚矣、該院負</p>
<p>責人見狀、恐有碍傷兵健康之恢復、故已嚴囑一切服役人等、以後任何人在傷兵面前均、不准再事吐露軍事消息云、</p>
<h3>南巿治安無虞</h3>
<p>▲黃隊長維持得力</p>
<p>南巿駐軍、自撤退後、所有各處防務、均由公安局警察大隊長黃明指揮所部警察及保衛團、共約二千餘人接防、竭力維持地方治安、故南巿各處秩序、昨仍安靜如常、惟因外間謠言甚多、以致搬塲者絡繹不絕、黃隊長昨語本報記者稱、渠日夜在局辦公、對於地方治安、當竭力維持負責保護、務望民衆力持鎭定、不必驚慌、又稱、外傳日兵已得漕河涇及龍華·完全不確、因龍華漕河涇一帶、余均派有警隊駐防云、</p>
<h3>外人評論我軍退師適當</h3>
<p>▲贊我將材智勇兼備</p>
<p>▲用兵神速令人驚嘆</p>
<p>記者昨晤某國軍事專家、論及我軍此次</p>
<p>退師之適當、並贊譽我軍事當局、爲智勇兼備不可多得之將材、爰濡筆述如下、（以下皆軍事家語）在戰事開始之初、據吾人預測與觀察、僉以爲戰事結束時間、至多不過在一星期與旬日之間、即可完全告一段落、初不料竟延長至三倍以上也、而雙方增援情形、又適成吾人預料中之反比例、蓋最初日軍僅有海軍陸戰隊數千之衆、初試鋒芒、即遭重挫、嗣後竟四易其主纛、陸續增援達四個師團、近十萬之衆、實非吾人始料所及者、至於華軍方面、則衆寡懸殊、何啻霄壞、蓋除十九路軍主力以外、增援者僅得數千人、尙不及</p>
<p>日軍半數、他如器械之優劣、砲火之利鈍、更不能與日軍同日而語、今竟相持逾月、日軍始終未能獲一次勝利、結果華軍全師自動引退、實屬難能可貴、設使華軍方面、亦能得充分之增援、犀利之器械、恐日軍早已失望而歸東瀛矣、再吾人所最引爲不平者、即日軍始終盤踞租界爲軍事根據地、攻則可進、退則可守、華軍則投鼠忌器、百事掣肘、不能自由發揮其天勇設使雙方同一形勢、實力均平、照目前之結果、吾恐在開戰兩旬之間、植田尙未來滬之前、日軍將掃數敗登軍艦、即或不能立時退歸三島、但最低限度、亦必遁竄出黃浦、而離淞滬矣、惟此次雙方犧牲之比較、日軍實較華軍數逾三倍、故吾人爲華軍着想、甚覺値得、今華軍當局更能於瀏河後方告急之際、從容不迫、一夜之間、全師悄然退去、其用兵之神速、更足令人警嘆、且退時秩序井然鷄犬不驚、尤堪令人起敬、實屬世所罕有之人傑、非智勇兼備之將材、不能得此、最後勝利、殆已完全獲得矣、</p>

<p>▲我方態度外交次長郭泰祺、接得日本覆文後、即於昨午電洛陽行政院長汪精衛·及南京外交部長羅文幹·請示、外交部發言人昨告本報記者稱、日方所提圓桌會議、性質如何、現尙未知、故須俟內容明瞭後、方允考慮、至所稱保障上海公共租界法租界並界內外人生命財產及利益一節、實屬不成問題、蓋我政府始終無意藉武力以改變租界現狀、以前所謂收回租界、亦循外交途徑進行、至於保護外人生命財產、我政府亦從未放棄此種責任也、</p>
<h3>滬西人心恐慌</h3>
<p>▲難民遷徙工廠停工</p>

<h3>華軍抗日爲防禦戰</h3>
<p>▲此後戰事是否擴大</p>
<p>▲全視日軍是否覺悟</p>
<p>大陸報云、中國軍隊因戰略關係、三月一日晚間自吳淞江灣閘北一帶全軍撤退、秩序整然、未喪一人一物、可謂能進能退者矣、此次中國抵抗日軍侵略之兵、人數之寡、外聞罕有知者、今旣全部撤退、毋容再守秘密、查十九路軍全體不滿二萬五千人、協同作戰之其他部隊、其數更少於此、其所抵抗之日軍、則時時增援、迄今已逾六萬人、且中國軍隊、自開始作戰、則處不利之形勢、軍械旣窳陋、子彈又不充足、更無飛機從事偵察、或轟炸敵陣要害之處、輔助作戰、日軍則所處形　頗優、有大小六十餘艘軍艦、在中國領海內、可從安全距離轟擊華軍陣線、更以全國海軍飛機之半數、從事轟炸缺乏高射砲之華軍、其陸軍砲隊在此次戰事、亦居極重要地位、彈藥之運輸、不虞襲奪、能無限量供給、儘可用以蕩平村鎭、破壞陣地、且除此物質上之優點外、日軍更可藉租界爲保障、其戰敗後、退回租界整理者不祗　數次、即日當道亦承認海軍陸戰隊曾迭遭殲歿之危、幸及時退入租界、得免潰覆、反之、中國軍隊則因須保持租界之中點、作戰須極謹愼、追逐戰敗之日陸戰隊時、未嘗有一次追入租界、中國司令深知有時以攻爲守、最爲上策、當日軍猛攻江灣廟行時、乘虛襲攻虹口日軍根據地、爲最優之戰略、但以此舉將違犯租界之中</p>

<p>立、明知爲行軍之利、卒未實行、且華軍始終爲防禦戰、遵從中央政府命令、僅於敵人進攻時、力戰却敵、藎以中國曾向國聯保證僅抵抗日軍之侵犯、不取攻勢也、日本之發言人及他國之表同情者嘗以喪失威望與顏面爲早日停止敵對行動之障碍、今中國軍隊、旣已撤至第二防線、已畀日軍一異常機會、重獲其已墜之威望與顏面、中國軍隊刻在距滬二十公里之外、已合於日軍要求之停戰條件、日人是否將踐言勿再擴大軍事行動、將於今後數日間觀之、倘日軍行動再遠逾二十公里區域之外、則其責任將全由日人負担、中國軍隊以善於撤退、未喪其戰鬥力、仍準備如一月二十八日在閘北之保護境土、果若日軍認敵人退兵爲大勝利、而圖繼續其軍事行動、即華軍之撤退、僅爲持久戰之開始、觀於遷都洛陽一舉、足見中政府政策未嘗不有長期抵抗之計劃、惟日人不宣之戰、施諸內地、則旣無租界可供失利時之退兵地、又乏良好道路行駛坦克車與重砲、更不能得軍艦之掩護、形勢上頓失若干優點、勝負之數正未可知、今租界內之西人、諒必以驚異中國軍隊撤退之迅速與整齊、其所慮華兵將闌入租界之虞、實屬毫無理由、中國人民覩目前局勢或將失望、但須知中國軍隊自始即未嘗期望大勝日人、久守陣地、今已可謂處極困難之環境下、有極良之成績、其抗戰器械犀利形勢優勝之日軍、至於一月以上、業已表示中國軍隊能若何保衛境土、抵禦可怖之新式軍器、今和平之努力、倘歸失敗、日人决意前進、則中國正在第二防線準備與敵一較短長、總</p>
<p>之、中日戰禍、今猶未已、茍非日人稍示大政治家風度乘機立停其敵對行動、則大戰正在前途也、</p>
<h3>日軍在滬之人數</h3>
<p>▲共有十二三萬人以上</p>
<p>此次日軍與我國十九路軍鏖戰一月有餘、日軍屢戰屢北近以日方繼續增添大批援軍、我軍除第九軍三師外、僅有八十八師與第五軍、人數不敵日方之半、且敵方有坦克車·飛機·重砲·爲之掩護衝鋒、我軍奮勇抵抗、殺敵過半、亦足以自豪矣、日方初次調來援軍、往往先事宣傳、以相恫嚇、後以面子關係、多秘密運滬、不准日報披露、故日軍在滬人數、究竟幾何、我人末由窺測、茲據日方可靠消息、日方兵力、最初鹽澤指揮陸戰隊六千餘人、商人義勇軍約三千餘人、第二次野村帶來陸軍萬餘人、特別陸戰隊三千餘人、第三次植田帶來陸軍第九師團約二萬餘人、第四次菱刈隆帶下第十一十二十四三個師團、約五萬人、以上人數、爲報上所揭載、我人所已知者、此次白川大將來滬、共帶有三個師團、均爲日本全國之精銳、一、東京第一師團（即日本禁衛軍）一、名古屋第三師團、以馬隊砲著名、日俄戰爭時曾在西伯利亞作戰建立大功、一、廣島第五師</p>
<p>團、爲名譽師團、（即模範軍）三師團人數、亦不下五萬人、故此次日軍在滬作戰人數、其總力量約有十二三萬人以上、故作戰時、在後方得以休養者、往往有四五萬人之多、此次十九路軍、雖爲戰略上關係、不能不退第二防線、然日方罄其全國之精華、以與我十九路軍作戰、亦未得多大之勝利、其技倆亦可測而知矣、</p>

<p>▲援救委員會提出抗議</p>
<p>大美晚報云、援救戰區難民委員會、由史派克爲會長、以金斯白萊副之、今日（二日）向工部局提出對公共租界內日海陸軍兵士行爲之嚴重抗議、該委員會爲名譽團體、志在與日當局合作、援助華人及他國人民遷出日本海陸軍所管轄之區域、連日已救出數千華人、但常遭極大之阻力、難獲全功、其初雖遇小困難、但在上星期日、該會外國代表護送中國平民入各區域者、皆爲日兵所阻、中國平民之携有經該委員會總部及靶子路六號日本學校內所設日本義勇團司令部核准之遷移證者、僅能由日人偕行、然自此使中國平民遭遇重大之困難、有爲日兵拘捕者、今猶未能查明踪跡、而至入口處、輒遭故意留難、致所僱卡車、因靜待日兵許可開入、往往費達數百元、且有多次、其費超過華人所欲搬運物品之價值、某華人因日本義勇團團員一人、不肯蓋印於其通行證、亦不說明拒絕之理由、致付出僱車費五百元云、</p>
<h3>日人對於南巿態度</h3>
<p>大美晚報云、日當局發言人今晨（三日）宣稱、如華人不損毀中國轄境外部之日人產業、則日軍不欲佔據南巿、如損及之、則日軍將先以飛機轟擊南巿、繼乃佔據之、以爲報復云、</p>

<h3>國聯行政會主席電促日本停戰</h3>
<p>限特議會開幕前答覆</p>
<p>顏惠慶提出重要說明</p>
<p>（日內瓦）　此間國聯中人今夜接上海消息、十九路軍雖已撤退至距滬二十公里外、而日軍事當局仍不準備接受英提督克萊爵士休戰提議、立即停止敵對行動、不免有憂慮之色、理事會主席彭古今夜特發急電至東京、請日本務於星期四正午（日內瓦時間）以前、答覆國聯關於上海時局</p>
<p>之提議、又請在星期四下午四時（日內瓦時間）國聯特會開幕以前、停止一切敵對行動、（二日國民電）</p>

<p>（日內瓦）　中國總代表顏博士今日以說明書提交國聯行政會、附以各種必要文件、蓋依照會章第十五條之規定也、此說明書旋交報紙披露、其警策之句曰、吾人刻在十字街頭、今在我人之前者、惟有和或戰之决定耳、此外無他道也、設日本爲是、則其黷武主義與殘暴武力、定將支配國際事件、設須保全新秩序也、則維護新秩序、此其時矣、日本與輿論相抗、日本利用武力、不能與莊嚴條約所載之世事新秩序相適合、文明世界之希望、今維莊嚴之條約是賴、中國不能自信其依賴以死者一千萬人傷者三千萬人之代價所造成及五十五國所擁護之會章、果爲鑄一大錯也云云、日代表午後亦發出一文、但謂之爲說明備忘錄、聲明日本不承認會章第十五條適用之合法、此備忘錄之原文尙未公佈、議長彭古已函致日代表佐藤、略謂議長所提議之圓桌會議、擊於戰爭之停止、請積極努力在明日國聯議會開幕以前、終止戰事、（二日路透電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）　中國提出國聯會之說明書、其導言首先鄭重聲明國聯會之根本問、題在解决中日關係、以恢復遠東永久和平、而尤以東北各省問題爲要、繼稱停止敵對行動以便討論主要問題一層、應立即加以注意、此次之事、情形嚴重、吾人即謂自一九一四年以來所有國際恐慌未有如此次之甚者、亦不爲過言、敵對行動、日本實爲禍首、無可置辯、而盟約第十五條、固爲國聯會盟約之柱石、今則橫被摧殘矣、夫日本爲國聯會會員、其承認第十五條無所保留、正與其完全接受盟約其他各條相同、今竟侵佔中國二十萬方哩之領土、轟擊上海及南京、此中國所不能不向世界舉發者也、日本之言曰、予之用此手叚乃因華人拒絕購買日貨、且對日本軍隊侵入中國領土不表歡迎所致、故日本之舉動、不能視爲侵略行爲、是無異言國家儘可遣派軍隊、侵佔外國土地、只須對外宣稱無任何領土野心、則其種種舉動、均禦爲非侵略行爲、此種議論時乃太怪、茲爲國聯會計、如不懲罰日本、則惟有將其盟約改爲一種宣言、謂國家之舉動是否爲侵略行爲、應由生事之國有隨其意思自由酌定之、如此則國聯會「保障和平」之口語、逕可改爲「獎勵戰爭」矣、說明書結論謂中國素信國聯會爲國際秩序及正義之担保者、其對國聯會盟約向極尊重、而其求援於國聯會亦具至誠、茲處極明顯而極急迫之情勢下、仍望國聯會行使其所有權力、以期立即制止日本之敵對及侵略行爲、使日本軍隊</p>
<p>從速退出中國領土、並用和平方法、以解决全部之中日爭端云云（二日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>我軍撤退後</p>
<h3>日軍尙圖深進</h3>
<p>陸軍省發言人之表示</p>
<p>（東京）　日軍受有訓令雖華軍被迫退至十二哩半外、日軍仍須進攻直至議定休戰條約而後已之說、不能證實、衆信此說未有根據、因日軍司令已屢次表示、並不欲追擊華軍越過平均十二哩半之距離也、不過爲策略起見、或須在某地點上稍行深進之必要耳、（三日路透社電）</p>
<p>（東京）　今日陸軍省發言人告路透訪員、謂俟華軍被逐出約二十基羅米突外、日軍即擬停止進攻、惟因地勢關係、在某地點上或有稍稍深進之必要、如華軍不欲反攻、則此後日軍無須進攻云、（三日路透社電）</p>
<p>（東京）　據某要津表示、上海日軍將分三期撤退、㈠立即在距滬約二十基羅米突取防守之陣綫、㈡一俟警衛中立區域之辦法商妥後、即撤至上海與吳淞區域、㈢一俟情勢許可、即完全撤回日本、（三日路透社電）</p>
<h3>顏惠慶表示接受休戰建議</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）　中國總代表顏惠慶博士致函國聯秘書長、接受上海英艦隊旗艦坎特號上所擬定根據雙方同時撤軍原則之休戰建議、函中謂雖日軍後曾取更大規模之攻勢、但中國仍準備接受此項建議、如能實行之、則中國願接受二月二十九日秘書長之建議、參與上海會議、惟須聲明者、該會議僅以恢復上海之和平爲限、此外一切中日間爭論之問題、應遵國聯所定之手續解决之、（三日路透電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）　中國總代表顏惠慶今日語美聯社記者、渠必須比現在試行休戰提議更有切實辦法商定之後、始能對於最近發展毫無懷疑、上海業已休戰之訊、尙未能證實、邇來所接停止敵對行動之訊、已不止一次、故此種突如其來消息、令渠不無懷疑據渠所接報告日軍曾進占一有利地位、但此事對於中國政策、將發生何種影響、則猶未接報告、並謂日本最近所提基本條件、能爲中政府接受與否、渠猶未悉、但可確言茍有榮譽解决辦法、將爲南京所接受云、（三日國民電）</p>
<p>我軍撤退淞滬</p>
<h3>博得國際好評</h3>
<p>華軍勇敢永不磨滅</p>
<p>最後榮譽仍屬中國</p>
<p>（柏林）　今晨全德報紙對于上海中國軍隊為戰略關係、撤退吳淞閘北、咸以爲極有政治的重要、並一致聲稱、戰爭榮譽仍屬中國軍隊、十九路軍能抵抗軍械遠勝之敵人至於卅四日、其勇敢與胆略常存天壤間、無有足以减損之者矣、柏林日報評論稱、中國軍隊之在日軍包抄行動猶未開始之際、即行撤退、實屬最適時宜、若再死守不退、並無實益、亦未必能再增十九路軍之威望、最後又謂日當道茍能踐言、則和平當能於比較短時期內達到、中國軍隊在此時撤退、顯然係政治行動、足見中國政府、準備獲得一榮譽之和平、波森日報亦預料可以早見和平、但謂上海事件、恐未必能僅藉簽字解决、並逆料全國對于三十四日激戰之反響、以爲不論上海不宣而戰之結局若何、其直接結果、已使中國站在新紀元之門閾、該報又極重視中國政府决定與俄復交事、謂一旦中俄聯盟後、恐將成爲世界之威脅、（三日國民電）</p>
<p>倫敦晨郵報今晨社論、謂就保全顏面點言之、華軍之退却、與日軍之前進、已顯然改善地位、華軍現已在二十基洛米達（即十二哩半）之外、是已履行休戰條件之一矣、華軍或謂並非被逐、但係自退、而日軍亦未嘗不可謂其所要求之條件、已爲華軍履行云、該報又謂此事可保全日內瓦之顏面蓋國聯議會在集議時、或見雙方視前較易就範圍、而使日本承認其所提出之休戰也云、（三日路透電）</p>

<h3>Formal Announcement to the Second Plenary Session · Bin</h3>
<p>The Kuomintang's Fourth Session, Second Central Committee Plenary Meeting, commenced on the second of this month. What is the purpose of convening the Second Plenary Session? The government proclaims to our people that it will jointly plan to resist foreign aggression and overcome the current national crisis. Our people are already well-acquainted with this rhetoric. Since the September 18th Incident last year, the government authorities have ceaselessly exhorted our people to remain calm, endure, and trust the government, stating that the government would ultimately not fail the country or the people. The First Plenary Session even solemnly</p>
<p>resolved to order all national troops to resist foreign aggression and violence, and recover lost territories. However, the ink on the records is still fresh, and how much of the resolution has been implemented? If the government authorities now recall this question, what better than to review the resolutions of the First Plenary Session and actively promote their implementation; otherwise, even if the meeting is reconvened, even a hundred times, what good would it do?</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident last year, our people have long recognized that only resolute resistance through our own efforts can safeguard the survival of our nation, and have resolved to fully support the government. We earnestly hoped that the government would make decisive decisions; however, the government procrastinated and ultimately led to the outbreak of the January 28th Incident. The national crisis is worsening. Who is to blame for endangering the country? Can the government authorities truly evade responsibility?</p>
<p>During this war, the 19th Route Army fought valiantly in isolation. The national spirit was aroused, and everyone was willing to die for the country. However, after a month of arduous fighting, the central government only sent a small number of reinforcements, while the enemy forces increased daily. Our reinforcements did not arrive, and the glorious achievements of the past month were almost entirely lost. Who should bear this responsibility? Can the government authorities truly evade responsibility? The land cannot be defended, the aggression cannot be resisted, the resolutions cannot be implemented, the enemy cavalry roams freely, and the country is fragmented. So, what is the point of holding meetings day and night? What good does it do?</p>
<p>We still remember the Jiang-Feng Longhai Railway campaign a few years ago. A Western newspaper published a satirical cartoon. In the drawing, one person held four hundred million public bonds in one hand and a pistol in the other; another person held bread in one hand and a broadsword in the other. This kind of heroic (?) spirit of decisive battle was once praised by foreigners. However, where are the pistols and broadswords today? Where is the heroism (?) of the past? We do not wish to say much at this meeting. If there is anything to say, it is that resisting aggression and self-defense is one of the most important aspects.</p>
<p>Shanghai Incident</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle at Liuhang: Our Army Victorious</h3>
<p>Our Army Safely Withdraws from Wusong Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>The Enemy Army in Dachang Zhenru Still Attempts to Advance</p>
<p>Various Sectors Send Telegrams Requesting Urgent Assistance for Resistance</p>
<p>Our Army Victorious at Liuhang</p>
<p>▲Enemy Army Retreats to Ships</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, a Shanghai commercial organization received a victory report from Liuhang, stating that after our reinforcements, including Shangguan Yunxiang's large army, arrived at Liuhang, they engaged in a fierce battle with the Japanese army, resulting in a major defeat for the Japanese. According to a transportation agency, our army recaptured Liuhang at 4:38 PM. The reporter was worried about verifying the report until, after 12:00 midnight, this newspaper received two telegrams from Suzhou correspondents reporting the retreat of the enemy army from Liuhang. The rumors have been confirmed. The original telegrams are recorded below:</p>
<p>Suzhou, 9:30 PM, Third Day Special Dispatch: After the recapture of Liuhang, the enemy army retreated to Qianjing. The enemy headquarters is located in Qianjing Elementary School. The artillery fire between Liuhang and Qianjing is intense. Our army in Taicang has rushed to Liuhang to launch a pincer attack. Changshu Baixikou is peaceful. Three enemy planes arrived in Changshu this morning for reconnaissance.</p>
<p>Suzhou, 11:00 PM, Third Day Special Dispatch: News from Liuhang this evening stated that the area is now entirely occupied by our troops. In addition, 20,000 of our reinforcements from Taicang have arrived. The enemy in Qianjing has retreated to the ships. Enemy ships were docked at Yanglin Qiwuerkou this morning.</p>
<p>According to news from Changshu regarding the situation at Liuhang, around 2:00 PM yesterday, the Weng Zhaoyuan Brigade stationed in Wusong withdrew from Songzhen to Liuhang and encountered the 11th Division of the Japanese army that had landed there. The battle was extremely fierce. At that time, our reinforcements from Shangguan Yunxiang's division arrived and launched a pincer attack, killing over 2,000 enemy soldiers. The enemy resisted stubbornly, and the battle was still ongoing at 8:00 PM last night.</p>
<h3>Our Army Withdraws from Wusong</h3>
<p>▲Yesterday Morning, Around 9:00 AM</p>
<p>Our army withdrew to the second defense line for long-term resistance and to avoid being surrounded by the enemy, in order to be able to advance to attack and retreat to defend. The Wusong garrison, still commanded by General Weng Zhaoyuan of the 156th Brigade and volunteers, held their ground and resisted until yesterday afternoon, when Brigade Commander Weng finally complied with the requests of various public organizations and withdrew from Wusong. The details of what was heard are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲Enemy Ships Attack</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, in addition to sending a large force of land troops to encircle our Wusong fort positions, the Japanese warships at the mouth of the Song River concentrated their firepower and launched an attack on the mouth of Wusong. The sound of cannons reverberated, and enemy planes circled above the Wusong fort, dropping bombs. Our defending soldiers remained calm and fought back. As a result, the Japanese soldiers were still unable to withstand the attack and retreated.</p>
<p>▲Withdrawal from Wusong</p>
<p>The Weng Brigade, which defended the Wusong fort, engaged in more than 20 battles, large and small, with the enemy army. The Japanese soldiers suffered heavy casualties, but our army remained firmly in its position. This time, the entire 19th Route Army withdrew to the second defense line, but Brigade Commander Weng remained steadfast and refused to leave. Later, representatives from various public organizations came and requested Brigade Commander Weng to preserve his strength and serve the country. Brigade Commander Weng finally yielded to public opinion and ordered a withdrawal around 9:00 AM yesterday. The Japanese army sent troops to the fort one hour after our troops withdrew. By 10:00 AM, they had changed the flags. Therefore, merchant ships entering the port after 10:00 AM yesterday knew that the fort had changed hands. It is said that the Weng Brigade retreated towards Liuhang.</p>
<p>▲Foreign Press Reports</p>
<p>The "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury" reported that yesterday (the 2nd) at 2:30 PM, Japanese warships at the mouth of the Song River first used planes for reconnaissance and then began to bombard the Wusong fort. The Chinese army responded with field guns, machine guns, and rifles for about an hour. The Japanese warships continued firing until sunset. This morning (the 3rd), Japanese naval aircraft flew over the fort area and dropped heavy bombs. At dawn, Japanese warships again bombarded the fort with 5-inch guns. At 7:00 AM, Japanese destroyers escorted three steamers carrying soldiers towards the coast in front of the lighthouse. At the same time, 60 to 70 Japanese soldiers from Zhanghuabang crossed the Yunzaobang on a pontoon bridge. The Japanese soldiers advancing from the south encountered fierce resistance when they entered Songzhen. When the two armies</p>
<p>engaged in battle, a large fire broke out and the entire area was shrouded in black smoke. The Japanese marines landed in small boats in four batches. The fort's defenders responded with field guns, machine guns, and rifles. One shell landed in a shallow draft boat carrying Japanese soldiers, killing and wounding several Japanese soldiers. Approximately 2,000 Chinese soldiers fiercely resisted the enemy army. However, being surrounded on three sides, they retreated along the embankment towards Liuhang. Therefore, there are rumors in Shanghai this morning that the Chinese army is counterattacking Liuhang. It is reported that heavy Chinese reinforcements are advancing from the interior towards Liuhang.</p>
<h3>Telegram from Our Military Generals</h3>
<p>▲One Heart, One Mind to Resist Brutal Japan</p>
<p>Jiang Guangnai and others telegraphed, (titles omitted) "Brutal Japan sends its soldiers to wreak havoc in Liaoning and casts covetous eyes upon the Southeast. Our 19th Route Army is ordered to defend the territory, making an emergency self-defense, battling them in Shanghai for more than a month. Initially, we fought fiercely with the enemy's naval marines and its initial landing army for more than twenty days, inflicting considerable casualties, and the enemy could not succeed. When their second batch of army arrived, two divisions of the 5th Army directly under the Central Government stationed in Jiangsu and Zhejiang also joined the battle, and we held our ground for another ten days, annihilating the enemy six or seven times, but the enemy still could not succeed. Finally, the enemy's General Shirakawa led two divisions to come, while we only had five divisions, numbering less than 40,000, who were always on the battlefield, and the enemy was twice our number. At this point, the enemy, on the one hand, feigned peace talks, deceptively negotiated a ceasefire, and deceived the League of Nations, and on the other hand, added one division to the front and landed one division near Liuhang, attacking our rear, making us subject to attacks from both the front and rear. Due to our transportation difficulties and the lack of timely reinforcements, we had no choice but to obey orders and abandon the front-line positions, making a strategic retreat to plan a counterattack. This is the account of the bitter battle fought by our 19th Route Army and the 5th Army against the enemy in the past month. Brutal Japan is attempting to destroy us with its established overall plan. We cannot achieve final victory without mobilizing the entire nation with great determination and making universal efforts. Our 19th Route Army and 5th Army are resisting the enemy not to seek a single victory, nor to contend with them for a day's advantage, but to offer this remaining flesh and blood for the sacrifice of saving the country, serving as the vanguard for our compatriots. Since the government moved to Luoyang, it has decided on a long-term resistance policy. Our national soldiers and civilians should uphold this purpose, rise up in unity, and respond with lightning speed, one falling and another stepping forward. Do not be concerned with the gains and losses of a corner of Shanghai, and do not be fooled by the enemy's divisive tactics. We especially hope that our Northeast compatriots, bearing the pain of being captives, will urgently send troops to recover the lost territories, causing the enemy to be burdened with multiple fronts, dividing their strength. Our 19th Route Army and 5th Army will exhaust their remaining courage to engage in a final struggle with the powerful enemy, hoping to achieve the effect of a pincer attack. Turkey fought bitterly for three years and finally defeated the 150,000 Greek troops, turning defeat into victory. The small tribe of the Transvaal was able to fight bloody battles for three years without yielding. Moreover, with our three million square miles of land and four hundred million people, if we can unite with one heart and one mind, we cannot annihilate this jumping clown. I do not believe it. When Korea was destroyed, it still had tens of thousands of soldiers, who were eventually disbanded by the Japanese to the last man. Now, the number of soldiers in our country is estimated to be no less than one million. Rather than being slaughtered after the country is destroyed, it is better to make a glorious sacrifice while the country is not yet destroyed. This time, brutal Japan has ravaged Shanghai for a long time, and the bombs have turned homes into ruins. The dead are piled high, and the surviving people all share the same hatred of the enemy, and no complaints are heard. Such tragic scenes are both tearful and worthy of song. The territory is still there, and the people are still there. Once sovereignty is lost and life is entrusted to the hands of the enemy, what will the misery be like? We only wish that our national elders and brothers will not forget Zhabei and Jiangwan, and that the military leaders of the nation will not forget Korea and today's Northeast. Brutal Japan publicly propagandizes to the international community, denouncing us as an unorganized country, or claiming that our people do not know the urgency of the situation, and that if you strike the head, the tail does not move, and that we can be defeated individually. Yet our national soldiers and civilians still take the nest as a curtain and the cauldron as a tour, and they can distinguish the meaning of fratricide and defense against foreign aggression, forgetting the cotenants in the</p>
<p>turbaned invaders, acting as neighbors closing their doors. This is truly what those who hate us are happy about, and what those who love us are pained by. Our 19th Route Army and 5th Army can only gather the remnants and fight with our backs to the city. If things do not succeed, we will die on the battlefield, to atone to the spirits of our Yanhuang ancestors in heaven. We do not wish to be people of a destroyed country. We dare say that the war in the time of Qian, though defeated, is still glorious, and we are fortunate that Jimo did not fall and that the invaded territory will eventually be returned. We put on our armor and wail, exhausting our tears with blood. We only ask that our compatriots truly understand this. Commander-in-Chief Jiang Guangnai, Commander of the 19th Route Army Cai Tingkai, Commander Dai Ji, Commander of the 5th Army Zhang Zhizhong, and all division, brigade, and regimental commanders bow in unison."</p>
<h3>Enemy Still Pursuing Our Army</h3>
<p>▲Our Army Will Of Course Continue to Resist</p>
<p>The "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury" reports that the main force of the Japanese 9th Division continued to closely pursue the Chinese army last night and this morning. 8,000 soldiers from the 11th Division landed in Liuhang on Tuesday morning and advanced south, reaching Jiading. They are currently continuing to advance, hoping to meet up with the 9th Division in Nanxiang. Nanxiang was occupied by the Japanese army at noon today. The Ueda Command is now located there. The Chinese army is now digging trenches and defending between Kunshan and Nanxiang. It is reported that last night they received heavy reinforcements from Jiang Dingwen and Shangguan Yunxiang's troops from Nanjing. If the Japanese army continues to advance west from Nanxiang, the Chinese army will have strong reinforcements and continue to resist. There is considerable hope. Troops from Zhejiang Province are also being deployed along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. It is said that they will arrive in Songjiang within a few days.</p>
<p>Staying in Shanghai</p>
<h3>Urgent Telegram from Central Committee Members Requesting Reinforcements</h3>
<p>▲Quickly Reinforce:: Recover Shanghai and Wusong</p>
<p>Central Committee members staying in Shanghai, Sun Ke and others, sent a telegram to the Central Government, limited for immediate delivery to President Wang and Chairman Jiang in Luoyang, and forwarded to all comrades in the Central Committee, labeled "Confidential". "Our country's resistance to Japan, the Shanghai battle is of utmost importance, the impact is the greatest, so the Japanese are continuously sending reinforcements, to the extent of exhausting their troops of 100,000, precisely because the solution to the Sino-Japanese problem, its key is really struck here. We initially had the 19th Route Army fighting alone, later adding the 5th Army, totaling no more than 30,000 to 40,000 people. Every battle they overcome the enemy, righteousness touching the clouds. However, the disparity in numbers is great, and they are increasingly exhausted. The danger of Shanghai has long been expected. The comrades in Shanghai, with a more thorough observation, repeatedly telegraphed requesting assistance, using words that exceeded their authority, urging and责备责备 the authorities, based on the meaning of what the heart considers dangerous, and not daring not to inform. Shouting until hoarse, blood and ink together, unexpectedly, it could not move the hearing of the authorities, to the extent that they were taken advantage of by the enemy, trapping our Liuhang, affecting the entire line. Looking at the communiqué of the 19th Route Army, the words 'no continued support', who caused this? The authorities cannot not bear the responsibility for it. The past is over, but the future can be pursued. Not avoiding abhorrence, we dare to give a frank and loyal admonishment again. Now, the party and the government have all arrived at a critical juncture. If the authorities' previous psychology of fearing the enemy and seeking temporary peace is not thoroughly eradicated, then not only will the anger of the masses be unstoppable, but how can those within the party who share the same views with the comrades bear the blame for endangering the country together with the authorities? One setback in Shanghai, the magnitude of the impact, is really beyond the power of pen and ink to exhaust. We privately believe that for the sake of the current situation, the authorities should make a great determination, quickly increase troops to recover Shanghai and Wusong, and on the one hand, decide on a positive plan for resisting Japan. This is the only way for the Chinese nation to survive. If there is further hesitation, the future will be dangerous, with things that the comrades cannot bear to say. The responsibility for reversing the situation rests entirely with you brothers. The comrades witnessed it and were heartbroken, not realizing that their words were too sharp. We only ask that you brothers observe it, Sun Ke, Chen Youren, Yang Shukan, Bai Wenwei, Cheng Qian, Chen Jiayou, Zhang Zhiben, Liang Hancao, Ma Chaojun, Chen Qingyun, Gui Chongji, He Shimian, Liu Luyin, Huang Jilu, Xiong Kewu, Sun Jingya, Chen Zhongfu, Jiang."</p>
<h3>Various Sectors Telegraph Requesting Continued Resistance Against Japan</h3>
<p>▲China Self-Strengthening Association</p>
<p>The China Self-Strengthening Association sent a telegram to the government, stating: "Luoyang Second Plenary Session, National Government, Executive Yuan, Military Commission, Your Excellencies, the loss of Shanghai and Wusong is the fault of the central government, endangering the country and harming the people, the grief and indignation are extreme. We earnestly request the swift dispatch of a large army to recover the lost territories. If you continue to engage in empty talk and plans, deceiving yourselves and the people, then the people's hearts will be lost, the foundation of the country will be shaken, and your excellencies will inevitably be subjected to severe sanctions by the people of the country, with no escape from divine punishment. China Self-Strengthening Association, winter."</p>
<p>▲Huangpu Alumni in Shanghai</p>
<p>Duan Yuanmou and 252 other Huangpu alumni in Shanghai telegraphed Messrs. Jiang, Wang, and He in Luoyang yesterday, stating: "Luoyang, Your Excellencies Jiang Jieshi, Wang Jingwei, and He Jingzhi, the troops resisting Japan in Shanghai suddenly retreated completely yesterday. Examining the reasons for the retreat, it is because the central government has been saying it would send reinforcements, but it has remained inactive. The news has spread, and public sentiment is indignant. Formerly, when your excellencies first heard of the Shanghai incident, you quickly fled to Luoyang. The people, because your excellencies once made oaths of long-term resistance, were still able to generously forgive you. Yet after the 19th Route Army resisted for a month, your excellencies have consistently failed to provide sufficient assistance. Even the troops who begged to kill the enemy were not conscripted by the government. The contradiction between words and actions is so great. How can you explain yourselves to the people? If your excellencies do not care about public opinion and insist on letting this great land fall into the hands of foreigners, then the people will have a way to deal with it. We will never let the Chinese nation be sacrificed at the hands of your excellencies, and the end of power-hungry traitors and national thieves throughout history will likely be inescapable for your excellencies. Huangpu alumni in Shanghai, Duan Yuanmou, Dai Huizhong, Chen Xun, Qin Shaotian, Chen Shichang, Wang Dapeng, Cai Chongxun, Deng Shiyuan, Deng Futong, Wu Zhiming, and 252 others bow together."</p>
<p>▲Two Organizations</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Federation of Business Circles and the Shanghai Special District Citizens' Federation telegraphed the military and political leader He Yingqin yesterday, stating: "Nanjing, Mr. He Jingzhi, forwarded to Chairman Lin and President Wang of the Military Commission and all members Jiang, Feng, and Li in Luoyang, brutal Japan invades Shanghai. Our 19th Route Army has fought bloody battles for a month, repeatedly repelling their fierce attacks. Recently, the enemy's large reinforcements have been arriving in a steady stream. The enemy is numerous, and we are outnumbered. Our isolated army lacks reinforcements. They were forced to retreat in general on the Japanese front line today. The hearts of the people in Shanghai and Wusong are terrified. Considering that the 19th Route Army is fighting the enemy alone, our Federation has repeatedly telegraphed the government to decide on a major plan and to send troops to assist as soon as possible. Unexpectedly, even today, not a single soldier or bullet has come to Shanghai. We sit idly by as the enemy forces the retreat of our front lines. What are the intentions of the government? They can bear to let our compatriots in Shanghai and Wusong fall into a cruel and painful situation, and to let the loss of tens of millions of lives and properties in the past month go to waste. Thinking of this, grief and indignation fill our chests. We dare to telegram your excellency, asking you to send troops to Shanghai as soon as possible to make efforts to restore the situation. Our entire population of Shanghai will not spare any sacrifice to resist the brutal enemy. If at this time you seek peace by seeking temporary安, or establish so-called neutral zones and free cities, etc., then this Federation dares to represent the three million people of Shanghai, vowing to resist to the death. We respectfully submit this telegram and respectfully request a reply. Shanghai General Federation of Business Circles and Shanghai Special District Citizens' Federation bow."</p>
<p>▲Southeast Five Provinces People's National Salvation Association</p>
<p>The Southeast Five Provinces People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association issued a public telegram, stating: "To all newspapers, forwarded to all compatriots across the country, since brutal Japan used the means of undeclared war, falsely using the name of protecting overseas Chinese, and carrying out armed aggression in reality, occupying the north and seeking the south, taking an inch and advancing a foot. Since the outbreak of the war, they have used every means of rape, arson, and murder, treating the lives and property of our people like weeds and insects, cruelty that has reached this extreme. If this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated? Unexpectedly, our 19th Route Army has fought bitterly and arduously for more than a month. The officials in power have other intentions, and reinforcements have not been sent. Moreover, they have strictly prohibited the troops from various provinces who volunteered to fight. Before the war, they dissolved anti-Japanese organizations in the name of diplomatic relations. After the war broke out, they further suppressed the organization of popular volunteer forces in the name of preventing reactionaries. Recently, the XXX division retreated without fighting, and Wang Geng, the commander of the independent brigade, surrendered to the Japanese army. Rumors are rife, and there is much talk of献西川. As a result, our 19th Route Army had no choice but to suffer all kinds of pressure and retreat to the second line of defense, the Shanghai and Wusong fortresses, falling into a desperate situation. Alas, where has the blood of our four hundred million people been spilled? Moreover, how can the compatriots in the war zone, the dead, the wounded, the fleeing, and the displaced, be even more miserable? Now, for the sake of our nation's survival of personality and for the country's survival of status, the 19th Route Army has done its duty to defend the territory, and our nation's responsibility to save the country has become even heavier. As long as one man remains, there is a responsibility to defend. The so-called heroes, even without King Wen, will still rise. The government is gone, what about our country? All our compatriots must rise up in unison, holding weapons together, to defend their localities. If there are jackals and wolves in power, they should all be driven out. From the thorns and brambles, open up a new world of hope. No matter what difficulties, we should not resign ourselves. Success or failure, we should put them aside. This is the hope that our countrymen share, and it is also what our countrymen should strive for together. The descendants of Yan and Huang still overcome each other. The Southeast Five Provinces People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association bows."</p>
<p>▲National Salvation Associations of Various Groups</p>
<p>The Shanghai United National Salvation Association of Various Groups sent a telegram to the Second Plenary Session, stating: "Luoyang Second Plenary Session, Your Excellencies, the Shanghai battle is due to the current government stopping troops and not assisting, sitting idly by and waiting for the isolated army to be surrounded by the enemy, forcing them to retreat. The so-called determination to resist before this was all a deceptive trick. Now that the enemy's forces are expanding, and you have succeeded with your clever plan, you will surely take the opportunity to sign humiliating terms that destroy our territorial sovereignty. The entire population of Shanghai vows not to recognize this. If you cannot sever yourselves from the people of the country, we hope you will quickly send troops to recover the lost territories. The Shanghai United National Salvation Association of Various Groups bows."</p>
<p>▲City Party Headquarters</p>
<p>Yesterday, the City Party Headquarters, due to the retreat of our army from the front lines, specially telegraphed the Central Government, advocating thorough resistance against Japan and requesting reinforcements for the Shanghai army to quickly plan a counteroffensive. The original text is as follows: "National emergency, Luoyang Central Executive Committee, Second Plenary Session, Your Excellencies, since the brutal Japanese invaded Shanghai, the morale of our army has been very high, and they have fought very bravely. The brutal Japanese initially thought they could occupy Zhabei within three hours, but now it has been delayed for as long as thirty-four days, and they still cannot step over Lei Chi for a single step. They are wrong, and we are right. They are old, and we are strong. The trend of military affairs is mostly like this. The brutal Japanese, unable to fulfill their兽欲 and greatly damaging their national prestige, are not sparing to raise the entire force of the country, making a desperate gamble, changing commanders four times, and attacking repeatedly. Yesterday, they used giant ships and aircraft as cover, landing more than 20,000 people in Liuhang, encircling the rear of our army. Our army, due to strategic relations and to respect the opinions of friendly nations' mediators, abandoned the front line this morning and returned to their troops to resist the enemy. When the news spread, most people were suspicious and panicked. However, victory or defeat is commonplace in military affairs, and this strategic retreat will not affect the overall situation. Within a few days, we will see them waving their weapons eastward and restoring their positions.</p>
<p>We can predict this. However, there is one thing that we would like to ask the Central Committee to pay close attention to, namely, the Shanghai battle is a scene in the entire Sino-Japanese problem, and it is the continuation of the Northeast Incident by the brutal Japanese, a continuation of aggression against China. Regardless of its nature and trend, it must be recognized as a national problem of China, and not a local problem of Shanghai. Therefore, the Shanghai problem should be regarded as one with the Northeast problem, and should be treated as a joint negotiation and an overall solution. It is not appropriate to regard the Shanghai problem as one thing and the Northeast problem as another, and it is even more inappropriate to regard the Shanghai problem as a local problem and conduct local negotiations and solutions, causing the sacrifices that the soldiers and civilians of Shanghai have endured in the past month to be thrown into the虚牝 and irretrievable. Although the military has retreated from the front lines, diplomacy should not soften midway. Please貫澈 the initial intention of moving the capital to defend the sea. On the one hand, reinforce the Shanghai army and actively counterattack. On the other hand, send troops to the Northeast to recover the lost territories. The survival of the party and the country depends on the moment. It is truly beneficial for our central authorities to plan it. Shanghai Special City Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang bows, winter."</p>
<h3>Wounded Soldiers Weep Bitterly After Our Army Retreats</h3>
<p>▲Sufficient to Show Morale Still Exists</p>
<p>Wounded soldiers stationed at the Jin Shenfu Road College of Political Science and Law yesterday heard that our army had changed its strategy, abandoned the first line of defense, and began to retreat to the second line of defense. More than a dozen soldiers cried bitterly, saying that we were born to die, fighting hand-to-hand with white blades, our blood splattered on the wilderness,拼命拼命拼命 on the battlefield, originally hoping to preserve the country's territory, not letting the enemy cross Lei Chi for a single step, but unexpectedly, it turned out so miserably. Can it not make people hurt so much? We want to cry but have no tears. The person in charge of the hospital, seeing this situation, was worried that it would hinder the wounded soldiers' recovery to health, so he has strictly instructed all service personnel that in the future, no one is allowed to reveal military news in front of the wounded soldiers, it is said.</p>
<h3>No Worries About Security in Nanshi</h3>
<p>▲Team Leader Huang Maintains Effectiveness</p>
<p>Since the withdrawal of the garrison troops in Nanshi, all defense tasks have been taken over by the Nanshi Public Security Bureau's police captain, Huang Ming, who commands the police under his command and the security regiment, totaling more than 2,000 people. They have made every effort to maintain local security, so the order in all parts of Nanshi remained calm as usual yesterday. However, because there are many rumors outside, movers are endless. Team leader Huang told this newspaper's reporter yesterday that he is working day and night at the bureau, and he will do his best to maintain the security of the area and be responsible for protecting it. He hopes that the public will remain calm and not panic. He also said that the rumors that the Japanese army has captured Caohejing and Longhua are completely inaccurate, because he has sent police teams to be stationed in the Longhua Caohejing area.</p>
<h3>Foreign Comment on Our Army's Appropriate Retreat</h3>
<p>▲ Praising Our General's Combined Wisdom and Valor</p>
<p>▲ Astonishingly Rapid Deployment Impresses</p>
<p>Yesterday, our reporter met with a foreign military expert who discussed the appropriateness of our army's recent retreat. He praised our military authorities as possessing both wisdom and valor, making them rare and invaluable generals. He then wrote the following (the following are all words of the military expert): At the beginning of the war, according to our predictions and observations, everyone believed that the war would end completely within at most one week to ten days. Initially, we did not expect it to extend to more than three times that. Moreover, the situation of reinforcements from both sides was inversely proportional to what we had anticipated. Initially, the Japanese army only had a few thousand naval marines. When they first tried their strength, they were severely defeated. Subsequently, they replaced their commander four times and successively increased reinforcements to four divisions, nearly 100,000 troops, which was indeed beyond our initial expectations. As for the Chinese army, the disparity in numbers was enormous, beyond comparison. Apart from the main force of the 19th Route Army, the reinforcements only amounted to a few thousand people, not even half the number of the Japanese army. Moreover, the superiority of weaponry and the sharpness of artillery fire were incomparable to the Japanese army. Yet, they have been deadlocked for over a month, and the Japanese army has failed to achieve a single victory. As a result, the entire Chinese army has voluntarily withdrawn, which is truly commendable. If the Chinese army had also received sufficient reinforcements and superior weaponry, I am afraid the Japanese army would have been disappointed and returned to Japan long ago. Furthermore, what we find most unfair is that the Japanese army has consistently occupied the concessions as a military base. They can advance when attacking and defend when retreating. The Chinese army, on the other hand, is constrained by many considerations and cannot freely display its natural bravery. If both sides were in the same situation and had equal strength, based on the current outcome, I fear that within two weeks of the start of the war, before Ueda even arrived in Shanghai, the Japanese army would have been completely defeated and boarded warships. Even if they could not immediately return to their islands, they would at least have had to flee from the Huangpu River and leave Shanghai. However, comparing the sacrifices of the two sides, the Japanese army's losses were more than three times greater than those of the Chinese army. Therefore, we believe it was worthwhile for the Chinese army. Now, the Chinese military authorities were even able to calmly and unhurriedly, overnight, completely retreat the entire army when the rear of Liuhe was in urgent need. The speed of their deployment is even more astonishing. Moreover, the orderliness of the retreat, without disturbing the chickens or dogs, is particularly admirable. They are truly rare talents in the world. Only generals with both wisdom and valor could achieve this. Ultimate victory has almost been completely secured.</p>
<h3>Content of the Japanese Reply</h3>
<p>▲ Our Side Telephoned Luoyang Yesterday Afternoon for Instructions</p>
<p>▲ The Japanese Side Announces Cessation of Offensive</p>
<p>The Japanese side announced the cessation of the offensive at 2:00 PM yesterday. As for the Japanese reply to the ceasefire, it was delivered to Vice Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi at the British Consul General's residence by British Navy Admiral Kelly at 9:30 PM the night before. The Japanese reply contains four articles, which are unofficially disclosed as follows:</p>
<p>▲ The Japanese Side's So-Called Basic Conditions for Immediate Ceasefire: (1) If China guarantees to withdraw its troops from Shanghai to a certain distance (the distance to be determined by the Chinese and Japanese authorities), Japan agrees to a ceasefire for a certain period (the period to be agreed upon by the Chinese and Japanese authorities). Before further measures are taken, the Chinese and Japanese armies will each defend their original positions. The details of the ceasefire will be negotiated by the Chinese and Japanese military authorities. (2) During the ceasefire period, China and Japan will hold a round-table conference in Shanghai, with representatives from all relevant countries participating, to discuss methods for withdrawing the Chinese and Japanese armies as described in the left section, along with methods for restoring and maintaining peace and order in Shanghai and its vicinity, and to reach an agreement on safeguarding the lives, property, and interests of foreigners inside and outside the Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession. (3) The withdrawal of troops (including plainclothes units) should begin with the withdrawal of Chinese troops to a designated distance. After the withdrawal of Chinese troops is verified as true, the Japanese troops will withdraw to the Shanghai and Wusong areas. Once normalcy is restored, the Japanese troops will then withdraw from the Shanghai and Wusong areas. (4) If one party violates the ceasefire conditions, the other party shall have the freedom of action. Furthermore, at the expiration of the ceasefire period agreed upon in the first section, both parties shall have the freedom of action.</p>
<p>▲ Our Side's Attitude: After receiving the Japanese reply, Vice Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi immediately telegraphed to the President of the Executive Yuan Wang Jingwei in Luoyang and Foreign Minister Luo Wen'gan in Nanjing yesterday afternoon to seek instructions. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told our reporter yesterday that the nature of the round-table conference proposed by the Japanese side is currently unknown, so consideration will be given only after the content is clarified. As for the clause concerning the protection of the lives, property, and interests of foreigners inside and outside the Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession, it is not a problem. The Chinese government has never intended to change the status quo of the concessions by force. The so-called recovery of the concessions in the past was also carried out through diplomatic channels. As for the protection of the lives and property of foreigners, our government has never abandoned this responsibility.</p>
<h3>Panic Among People in Western Shanghai</h3>
<p>▲ Refugees Migrate, Factories Shut Down</p>
<p>Since the retreat of our army the day before yesterday, the entire city of Shanghai has been in a state of panic. In the western part of Shanghai, due to the gradual westward advance of the Japanese army, the local people are even more anxious. Therefore, the situation in various places in western Shanghai yesterday is recorded below: (1) In Beixinjing, shops and residents began to move away early yesterday morning, and by noon, it was completely empty. There were no Japanese troops stationed around the town or nearby. However, the villagers in Zhuzhai, Qibao, and the border areas of Shangqing all fled. (2) At Fanhuangdu and Dayangqiao, a team of Italian soldiers was stationed to provide strict defense, and machine guns were set up. At the gate of the Japanese-owned Toyota Textile Factory, there were more than a dozen Japanese marines and plainclothes agents stationed. At around 10:00 AM yesterday, due to the large number of refugees fleeing from west to east, the stationed troops once stopped and cut off traffic. Traffic was restored at noon, but everyone had to be searched before being allowed to pass. (3) In Caojiadu, all the factories in the town have stopped work, and shops and residents are hiding indoors, in a state of extreme panic. Occasionally, a few people carry boxes and bundles and move to Shanghai. The major passes are guarded by Italian troops. District Chief Xu, from the Sixth District, and police officers patrol the roads and near factories in turns to conduct strict inspections. Refugees from the northern banks of the river are all ferrying across at the Damuqiao ferry behind the town, like a tide from morning to dusk. Fortunately, there were no obstacles. (4) At Sanbanqiao Bridge, the barbed wire frame on the bridge was removed yesterday. The refugees fleeing from north to south are very crowded. At noon, more than a dozen Japanese soldiers were stationed at the northern end of the bridge, but those going north had to be inspected.</p>
<h3>Fair Commentary by the "North China Daily News"</h3>
<p>▲ Refuting the "Danger of the Third Party" Theory</p>
<p>▲ Rejecting Japanese Attempts to Entice Various Countries with Benefits</p>
<p>▲ Praising the Chinese Army's Caution and Respect for the Concessions</p>
<p>Yesterday, the "North China Daily News" published an editorial entitled "The Danger of the Third Party," rejecting Japanese attempts to entice various countries with the benefits of war to collectively pressure China. There are some commendable points. The translation is as follows: The Japanese army's firm insistence on controlling the Chinese army around Shanghai is the key to creating peace in China. This newspaper (the "North China Daily News") discussed the possibility of this kind of controversy two days ago. It clearly expressed its disapproval of this view on moral grounds and stated that on practical grounds, this theory is also untenable, especially due to the events of the past three weeks. Unexpectedly, foreign quarters are now expressing a shocking opinion, saying, "Any peace that can be interpreted as a defeat for the Japanese army will make it difficult for foreigners to feel secure in China." Alas, what is this saying? If the world and China are given the impression that foreigners or any responsible part of the discussion group can hold this view, then the position of foreigners here will be even more difficult. The possibility of the Japanese army's defeat can now be avoided. Even if the Chinese army and its people can resolutely continue to resist, they do not harbor this illusion. Therefore, the above-mentioned words of foreigners may be the result of an occasional outburst for amusement. If it is indeed an expression of opinion, then this newspaper must refute it with all its strength. This is a slander against foreigners, implying that the British and other people in China are weak and incapable and must rely on a strong outsider to protect their rights. That is, the position where foreigners can feel secure is created by the Japanese sacrificing lives and money. That is, all countries are abandoning the policies they have accepted and directed in their own names and preparing to accept the benefits gained by blatantly attacking these policies. The whole world is now painfully aware that moral codes, although still respected by the majority, are often not fully followed in international actions. However, we cannot accept the view that these codes have been arbitrarily disregarded or that the act of disregarding them can win public applause and expediency. The Japanese government should know the seriousness of the danger that the third party has suffered or must continue to suffer in this frivolous and unwise war in Shanghai. Fortunately, although the resistance is currently huge, peace talks are gradually progressing. The recent advance of the Japanese army may also encourage Tokyo's efforts towards peace. It is clearly unfair to place the burden of the "danger of the third party" mentioned above on the Japanese army. Japan has clearly stated that it does not want to occupy the land of Shanghai. All it cares about is protecting the lives and rights of Japanese residents. If it is said that they have taken appropriate action to implement this policy, this newspaper does not allow it. Even if it is not allowed, it is too polite to allow foreigners to harvest what they have not sown. Once the talk turns to defeat and its psychological impact on various countries, it is too dangerous to jump to conclusions. If the Chinese army lays down its arms today, unless there are foolish and indulgent actions in the future, the spiritual victory it has gained by resisting the Japanese army cannot be forcibly erased. If the Japanese decide to disregard peace proposals or make these proposals difficult to implement and expand their actions to defeat the Chinese army, they will only confirm the long-standing military advantages and at the same time increase the world's moral opposition to their policies. The statements of Japanese officials in recent days have not proven that the Japanese are willing to bear this additional condemnation. This newspaper has previously written frankly that China's petition to world public opinion can initiate a world conference to discuss the entire relationship between China and the powers. From the Chinese side, preserving the safety and integrity of the International Settlement and the French Concession must be considered an important principle. In our discussions, we must pay attention to the state of compliance with this principle by all parties. Japan's actions in this matter are the same as China's political encroachment. Furthermore, one characteristic of the activities of the 19th Route Army that has been praised by fair observers is their careful respect for the interests of non-Japanese people. This is proven beyond dispute by the British residents on various roads outside the concession. The "protection" of Hongkou claimed by the Japanese cannot be compared to the same aspect of proof. Therefore, the lessons of past suffering should not be ignored, and the ordinary rules and practical concerns of creating appropriate international relations should prevent any attempt at discussion based on the bad habit of distrusting Chinese goodwill, or this will ultimately realize the unwisdom of the "enticement" methods currently used by the Japanese. Although the hope of an immediate ceasefire is uncertain, this matter will eventually be discussed by all relevant parties. Although the League of Nations is being bumped, despised, ridiculed, and spat upon, even those who oppose the League of Nations the most today say that the League of Nations is indeed a suitable mechanism for reconciliation. This statement may be believed or not, but the friendship between China and Japan will eventually be restored one day. How to maintain the interests of other countries' people during this process depends entirely on the attitude of the two countries after suffering the pain of this war. If it is said that benefits can now be obtained from the misused force of agency, and this action has been formally opposed by general profiteers, then nothing is more harmful to the interests of foreign nationals. This is the "danger of the third party" that should be refuted in the most severe terms.</p>
<p>Commentary in the Continental Daily News</p>
<h3>Chinese Army's Resistance Against Japan is a Defensive War</h3>
<p>▲ Whether the War Will Expand Further</p>
<p>▲ Depends Entirely on Whether the Japanese Army Awaken</p>
<p>The Continental Daily News states that the Chinese army completely withdrew its troops from the Wusong, Jiangwan, and Zhabei areas on the evening of March 1 due to strategic reasons, in an orderly manner, without losing a single person or item, which can be said to be able to advance and retreat. Few outsiders know how small the number of Chinese troops resisting the Japanese invasion is. Now that they have all withdrawn, there is no need to keep it a secret. The entire 19th Route Army is less than 25,000 people, and the number of other troops fighting in cooperation is even smaller than this. The Japanese army they are resisting has been constantly reinforced, and has now exceeded 60,000 people. Moreover, the Chinese army has been in an unfavorable situation since the beginning of the war. The armaments are dilapidated, the bullets are insufficient, and there are no aircraft to carry out reconnaissance or bomb the key points of the enemy's阵阵, assisting in the battle. The Japanese army is in a very advantageous position. There are more than 60 warships of various sizes in Chinese territorial waters, which can bombard the Chinese army lines from a safe distance. Half of the national naval aircraft are used to bomb the Chinese army, which lacks anti-aircraft artillery. The army artillery队 also plays a very important role in this war. The transportation of ammunition is not worried about being raided, and can be supplied in unlimited quantities, and can be used to raze villages and destroy positions. In addition to these material advantages, the Japanese army can also use the concessions as a guarantee. There are countless times when they retreat to the concessions to reorganize after being defeated. Even Japanese officials admit that the naval marines have repeatedly suffered the danger of being wiped out, and were fortunate to retreat into the concessions in time to avoid collapse. On the contrary, the Chinese army has to be extremely cautious in its operations in order to maintain the focus of the concessions. When chasing the defeated Japanese marines, there has never been a time when they chased into the concessions. The Chinese commander knows that sometimes attacking is the best defense, and when the Japanese army launched a fierce attack on Jiangwan Miaoxing, it would be the best strategy to take advantage of the opportunity to attack the Japanese army's base in Hongkou. However, this move would violate the neutrality of the concessions. Although they knew it was beneficial for marching, they did not implement it. Moreover, the Chinese army has always been a defensive war, and followed the orders of the central government, only fighting back when the enemy attacked, because China had guaranteed to the League of Nations that it would only resist the Japanese army's invasion and would not take the offensive. Spokespersons of Japan and others who express sympathy have used the loss of prestige and face as obstacles to stopping hostilities as soon as possible. Now that the Chinese army has withdrawn to the second defense line, it has given the Japanese army an extraordinary opportunity to regain its fallen prestige and face. The Chinese army is now 20 kilometers away from Shanghai, which meets the Japanese army's demands for a ceasefire. Whether the Japanese will keep their promise not to expand military operations will be observed in the next few days. If the Japanese army acts more than 20 kilometers beyond the area, then the responsibility will be entirely borne by the Japanese. The Chinese army is good at retreating, has not lost its combat effectiveness, and is still preparing to protect its territory in Zhabei on January 28. If the Japanese army recognizes the enemy's retreat as a great victory and attempts to continue its military operations, then the Chinese army's retreat is only the beginning of a protracted war. The move to move the capital to Luoyang shows that the government's policy has never had a long-term resistance plan. However, the undeclared war by the Japanese army in the inland areas has no concessions for retreat when defeated, lacks good roads for tanks and heavy artillery to drive on, and cannot get the cover of warships. The situation has lost some advantages, and the outcome of the victory or defeat is still unknown. The Westerners in the concessions must be surprised by the speed and order of the Chinese army's retreat. Their worry that Chinese soldiers will break into the concessions is completely unfounded. The Chinese people may be disappointed with the current situation, but it should be known that the Chinese army has never expected to win a great victory over the Japanese army from the beginning. It has defended the position for a long time, and can now be said to have achieved excellent results in an extremely difficult environment. It has resisted the Japanese army, which has sharp weapons and an advantageous situation, for more than a month, and has already shown how the Chinese army can defend its territory and resist the terrible new weapons. If the efforts for peace fail and the Japanese are determined to advance, then China is preparing to fight the enemy on the second defense line. In short, the Sino-Japanese war is not over yet. If the Japanese do not show the demeanor of a great statesman and take the opportunity to stop their hostile actions, then a great war is on the horizon.</p>
<h3>Number of Japanese Troops in Shanghai</h3>
<p>▲ A Total of More Than 120,000 to 130,000</p>
<p>The Japanese army has been fighting fiercely with our 19th Route Army for more than a month. The Japanese army has been repeatedly defeated and is now continuously adding a large number of reinforcements. Our army, in addition to the three divisions of the 9th Army, only has the 88th Division and the 5th Army. The number of people is less than half of the Japanese side, and the enemy has tanks, aircraft, and heavy artillery to cover the charge. Our army fought bravely and killed more than half of the enemy, which is enough to be proud of. When the Japanese side first deployed reinforcements, they often publicized it in advance to intimidate. Later, due to face issues, they secretly transported them to Shanghai and did not allow the Japanese newspapers to disclose it. Therefore, we do not know how many Japanese troops are in Shanghai. According to reliable sources from the Japanese side, the Japanese side's troop strength initially consisted of more than 6,000 marines commanded by Shiozawa and about 3,000 merchant volunteers. The second time, Nomura brought more than 10,000 army troops and more than 3,000 special marines. The third time, Ueda brought the 9th Division of the army, about 20,000 people. The fourth time, Hishikari Takashi brought the 11th, 12th, and 24th divisions, about 50,000 people. The above numbers are what have been revealed in the newspapers and what we know. This time, General Shirakawa came to Shanghai and brought a total of three divisions, all of which are the elite of Japan. One is the 1st Division of Tokyo (ie, the Japanese Imperial Guard), one is the 3rd Division of Nagoya, famous for its cavalry and artillery, which made great contributions in Siberia during the Russo-Japanese War, and one is the 5th Division of Hiroshima, which is an honorary division (ie, a model army). The number of people in the three divisions is no less than 50,000. Therefore, the total strength of the Japanese army fighting in Shanghai this time is about more than 120,000 to 130,000. Therefore, there are often 40,000 to 50,000 people who can rest in the rear. This time, the 19th Route Army had no choice but to retreat to the second defense line for strategic reasons. However, the Japanese side exhausted its national elite to fight with our 19th Route Army, and did not win much victory. Its tricks can also be measured and known.</p>
<h3>Statement by the United Association of National Salvation Organizations</h3>
<p>▲ Spare No Sacrifice to Restore</p>
<p>▲ Oppose the Destruction of Sovereignty and Vow to Resist to the Death</p>
<p>The Shanghai United Association of National Salvation Organizations issued an urgent notice to all public organizations in the city, saying that the withdrawal of the 19th Route Army and other friendly troops who voluntarily came to Shanghai to fight was entirely due to the small number of people, the long front lines, and the fact that the government refused to send any reinforcements. The enemy's large reinforcements landed near Liuhe, attempting to encircle our army's rear. Our army wanted to resist, but suffered from the lack of troops to send. In order to avoid useless sacrifices, we had no choice but to retreat in pain. All citizens of our city should deeply mourn, unite as one, spare no sacrifice, and strive to restore. We vow to oppose any plans to destroy our territorial sovereignty, such as the neutral zone, peace zone, and free army. This is hereby announced.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Obstructs Rescue of Refugees</h3>
<p>▲ Relief Committee Lodges Protest</p>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post reports that the Relief Committee for Refugees in the War Zone, chaired by Spike and deputized by Kingsmill, today (the 2nd) lodged a serious protest with the Shanghai Municipal Council against the behavior of Japanese naval and army soldiers in the Public Concession. The committee is an honorary organization that aims to cooperate with the Japanese authorities to assist Chinese and other people in moving out of the areas under the jurisdiction of the Japanese naval and army. It has rescued thousands of Chinese people in recent days, but it has often encountered great resistance and has not been able to achieve full success. Although it initially encountered minor difficulties, last Sunday, foreign representatives of the committee escorting Chinese civilians into various areas were all blocked by Japanese soldiers. Chinese civilians who carried movement certificates approved by the headquarters of the committee and the Japanese volunteer force command set up in the Japanese school at No. 6 Bazilu could only be accompanied by Japanese people. However, this has caused great difficulties for Chinese civilians. Some have been arrested by Japanese soldiers and have not yet been found, and at the entrances, they are often deliberately made difficult, causing the hired trucks to wait for Japanese permission to enter, often costing hundreds of yuan. In many cases, the cost exceeds the value of the items that the Chinese want to move. A Chinese person paid 500 yuan in truck rental fees because a member of the Japanese volunteer force refused to stamp his pass and did not explain the reason for the refusal.</p>
<h3>Japanese Attitude Towards Southern Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post reports that a spokesman for the Japanese authorities stated this morning (the 3rd) that if the Chinese do not damage Japanese property outside the Chinese-controlled territory, the Japanese army does not want to occupy southern Shanghai. If it is damaged, the Japanese army will first bomb southern Shanghai with aircraft and then occupy it as retaliation.</p>
<h3>Traces of Enemy Troops North of Shanghai</h3>
<p>▲ Tragic Situation After the War</p>
<p>▲ Japanese Troops Enter Zhabei: After entering Zhabei, the Japanese army hung Japanese flags and military flags everywhere on tall buildings. Three to five Japanese soldiers were stationed at the remnants of the station warehouses on Xinmin Road, and the railway tracks there have been completely destroyed. Ruins of tiles and bricks can be seen everywhere. In the distance, several plainclothes agents are repairing. A section of the overpass in the west has been cut off, and telegraph poles are lying on the side of the road. In the west of the station, there seem to be a large number of corpses covered with straw. There are several wrecked rickshaws and carts left on the road. A black car is parked at the entrance of Songhu Station. The soil is uneven and raised, as if it was destroyed by a bomb. Cartridge shells are all over the ground. The windows and doors of a foreign cloth shop at the eastern end of Jielu Street are wide open, and dozens of Japanese soldiers are stationed inside. There is a field gun and two machine guns at the entrance, as well as a white horse, which seems to be the headquarters of a certain regiment. Officials and police officers from the Fourth District General Office of the Municipal Public Security Bureau and the first and second sub-stations of the Fourth District have learned that the Japanese army is approaching, but the progress is very slow. The advance troops are walking close together in two groups of ten, and are carrying Jiangbei people as guides, but they dare not walk in the middle of the road for fear of Chinese mines. When passing by shops on both sides, they order them to operate as usual. According to eyewitnesses, after 2:00 PM yesterday, a large amount of kerosene and ignition materials were transported from Baoshan Road and piled up under the overpass. More than a dozen Japanese soldiers were guarding the area. About 150 Japanese soldiers arrived at the Gengxin Stage in Kaifeng Road at about 1:00 PM yesterday and immediately occupied the entire building. They immediately sent out sentries on Xinmin Road behind the stage, west to Xinzha Bridge and north to Datong Road, and east to Baoshan Road, connecting with the Japanese navy that arrived there yesterday morning.</p>
<p>▲ After Occupying Zhenru, the Japanese Army Deployed Defenses: After occupying Zhenru, the Japanese army immediately deployed defenses there. More than 40 residents of the town were shot and killed for being found with military uniforms abandoned by the 19th Route Army. At the same time, they set fire to the Lichuan River area, and all villages in the four directions have hung Japanese flags. All Japanese plainclothes agents and traitors are active in all directions. No woman with slightly attractive features is spared. Looking into the distance, the fires in the four directions are no less than 40 places, which can be said to be tragic.</p>
<p>▲ Yesterday Morning at About 9:00 AM on Zhongshan Road: More than 20 Japanese soldiers riding motorcycles with machine guns mounted on them went to the Zhoujiaqiao Sixth District Sub-Station and confiscated the firearms of the six police officers. Soon after, two armored artillery vehicles came to and fro to show off their power. At about 10:00 AM, several trucks loaded with Japanese soldiers patrolled back and forth.</p>
<h3>Dixwell Road Police Station Reopens Today</h3>
<p>▲ Chinese Residents Can Enter and Exit with Permits</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Information Office announced that starting March 4th, foreigners and Municipal Council police officers can freely enter the Dixwell Road area, north of Sichuan Road and Dixwell Road. Chinese residents of good standing within the area, including those residing on both sides of Pairen Road and Pairen Second Road, can obtain permits after the Municipal Council police station verifies their status as law-abiding citizens. However, they must go to Room 272 on the second floor of the General Police Station to fill out a form and obtain the permit. Those holding permits are guaranteed entry to the area, and the permit must be shown upon entry, but not upon exit. Cars and rickshaws can also pass through if the passengers hold permits. This is the first step in restoring normalcy to the Dixwell Road area. Municipal Council police officers are scheduled to return to the Dixwell Road Police Station on the morning of March 4th.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Minhang Bus Crushes a Thug to Death</h3>
<p>▲ Planned to Commit Arson in Minhang</p>
<p>▲ Unexpectedly Lost His Own Life First</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Minhang-Zhejiang Long-Distance Bus Company on Guohuo Road in the Nanshi district had a scheduled bus depart at 3 PM the day before yesterday. While driving to the Tushanwan station, a thug hid on the roof. When the bus reached Qianliang Temple, a fire started on the roof. After stopping the bus and inspecting, a person was found lying on the roof, his clothes burned. Passengers extinguished the fire. The person was still alive. At Minhang hospital, the thug confessed that he had brought sulfur to start fires in Minhang, and seventy-three dollars of foreign currency was burned. Then, he requested that a letter be sent to his family. He died soon after. The Minhang District Office reported the situation to the authorities yesterday.</p>
<h3>Situation in Zhabei and North of the Suzhou Creek</h3>
<p>▲ Zhabei Refugees Fleeing South in Droves</p>
<p>▲ Japanese Soldiers North of the Suzhou Creek Turning Back</p>
<p>After our garrison in Zhabei retreated to Nanxiang, the Japanese only sent troops to northern Shanghai yesterday, stationed in various locations. When the reporter first heard that Zhabei had been opened and could be freely passed, he went to Zhabei at 1 PM, hoping to see the state of homes in the war zone. He took Zhejiang Road, passed the west of Shanghai court, passed Qipu Road, Haining Road, and entered Nanlin Lane, Tianbao Lane, passed Han Bridge, and entered Zhabei. All the way, he saw refugees carrying items, heading south. These refugees said they were from Haining Road, Tianbao Lane, Nanlin Lane, because Japanese soldiers had arrived. When the reporter wanted to go to Ningshan Road, three refugees fleeing from Qiujiang Road persuaded him not to go, saying Ningshan Road, Hongxing Road, Xiangshan Road, and Yongxing Road had all been burned down. Japanese soldiers in Zhabei not only thoroughly searched those wearing long gowns, but also arrested them without caution. Furthermore, their actions against women were unspeakable. In the houses that had not been burned, Jiangbei natives, acting as traitors, broke down the front and back doors, taking all the items. The Japanese soldiers knowingly turned a blind eye. These Jiangbei natives had grenades and pistols and today, they are searching and robbing refugees in Zhabei. The three refugees were disheveled when they escaped. Hearing this, the reporter did not continue forward. At the Xin Zha Bridge, a row of Japanese soldiers in trucks were stopped by the US army stationed at the post. If they wanted to enter the concession, they had to surrender their weapons. The Japanese soldiers had to return to Zhabei. The reporter returned to North Shanxi Road and North Henan Road. Foreign soldiers were transporting bullets and other items to fortify the iron gates in various locations. Residents north of the Suzhou Creek, fearing the Japanese soldiers would rush in, were moving to Binjiang South yesterday.</p>
<h3>Major Fire at Liuying Bridge</h3>
<p>▲ Tanjia Bridge Police Station Burned Down</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, a major fire broke out north of Gonghe Xin Road and south of Liuying Bridge. About dozens of civilian houses facing west were almost completely destroyed. The Tanjia Bridge Police Station of the Fourth District of the Public Security Bureau was also completely burned down. More than a dozen houses facing east on the south side were also burned. Because no fire trucks went to fight the fires on Zhongxing Road, Yongxing Road, and Qiujiang Road, they were not extinguished.</p>
<h3>French Minister Returns to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Visited Guo Taiqi Yesterday</p>
<p>French Minister Wilden, who went to Beijing for the Shanghai ceasefire issue to meet with Foreign Minister Luo Wengan, has returned to Shanghai by ship. Yesterday, he visited Vice Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi to discuss matters.</p>
<h3>Issue of Resuming Diplomatic Relations Between China and Russia</h3>
<p>▲ Government Has No Concrete Decision Yet</p>
<p>There are many rumors about resuming diplomatic relations between China and Russia. According to sources in diplomatic circles, some people in the central government have raised this suggestion. However, although the government authorities have discussed it at one time, there has been no concrete decision as of now.</p>
<h3>Relief Work</h3>
<p>▲ Red Cross Relocates Wounded Soldiers in Nanshi</p>
<p>The Red Cross has established wounded soldier hospitals in Nanshi and Zhabei. Except for the No. 41 on Hengfeng Road in Zhabei, which closed some days ago, there are seven in Nanshi: the Third Hospital in Sixteen Puli, the Public Hospital, the Eighth Hospital, the Thirteenth Hospital on Fumin Road, the Sixteenth Hospital outside the Great South Gate, the Thirtieth Hospital in Dongjiadu, the Thirty-First Hospital on Penglai Road, and the Thirty-Seventh Hospital on Fumin Road. There are a large number of wounded soldiers. Due to the increase in rumors in the city, the society transferred wounded to safe hospitals for treatment. As for rescue teams, there were no battles nearby.</p>
<p>▲ Red Swastika Society Sends Away Refugees Residents in the Nanshi area have been relocating. The Red Swastika Society chartered a small steamer to send away hundreds of refugees from Xijie. Each person was given dry food on the boat. The refugees from Zhejiang were received by the Hangzhou Red Swastika Society for resettlement. The refugees from Jiangbei were sent to Zhenjiang Red Swastika Society.</p>
<p>▲ Chaozhou Fellow Countrymen Relieve Refugees The Shanghai Chaozhou Association donated 270 shirts and pants, 40 quilts, and 5,000 loaves of bread to the temporary relief association for war-zone refugees. The Shanghai Special District Citizens' Federation donated 400 yuan.</p>
<p>▲ Zhu Shi'en's Enthusiastic Relief Mr. Zhu Shi'en has invested in Shien Relief Center, which takes in 800 people in Xin Zha Lou, and opened Red Cross Hospital No. 36. These are all paid for by himself. He is pawning private assets. He is a role model for the world.</p>
<p>▲ Zhenru and Nanxiang Refugees Zhenru and Nanxiang are in serious conditions. Residents of both places have fled. The Extreme Asifi Road Red Swastika Society's fifth reception center took in more than 400 refugees last night.</p>
<p>▲ Achievements of the Refugee Medical Team The Shanghai Refugee Medical Team is holding free clinic at the corner of the Third Road and Moore Church. The first team has been effective. As the number of refugees increased, the team organized a second team. The medical clinic reaches 20 to 30 locations. Five or six hundred refugees have been healed. The team's expenses depend on charity organizations.</p>
<p>▲ Disposal of Property for Relief After the outbreak of the Shanghai War, all industries have stopped. Many silk workers lost their jobs. The Hang silk industry organized a petition group, requesting the approval of Industry and Social Affairs Bureaus to investigate the Qianjiang Guild Hall, dispose of property and give workers relief. The Industry and Social Affairs Bureaus approved. The curators of National Merchandise Exhibition Hall Chen Zheng and accountant Pan Xulun are investigating the guild hall and registered the laid off workers. Because workers were scattered in various places, the task was difficult. The task was commissioned to attorney Cao Lin, which is located on Xizang Road and Second Road.</p>
<h3>Condolence Messages</h3>
<p>▲ Distressed Students Sheltered Various schools in Shanghai have been promoting the situation of the Japanese invasion. To address the accommodation problem of 700 students, representatives, including Cao Weiqi, asked the Municipal Government and Municipal Education Bureau to set up a portion of safe schools to house the students. The Municipal Education Bureau has arranged accommodation in the art school on Caishi Road. The mess will be maintained by the local maintenance association. The students will work for the country.</p>
<p>▲ American Association Donates Money All Chinese staff of American Association are donating money. The plan will start from February, donating half a cent(5%) for salaries under 20 Yuan and donating one cent (10%) for salary above 20 Yuan. The money is sent to the front line.</p>

<h3>League of Nations Special Assembly Opens</h3>
<p>US Disarmament Representatives Attend as Observers</p>
<p>Representatives of Small Countries Have Freedom to Speak</p>
<p>Peng Gu States the Course of the Sino-Japanese Case</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Hymans Elected Chairman</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Assembly convened a special session to consider the Sino-Japanese dispute this morning at a few minutes after 11:00, conducted by Peng Gu. Because this meeting has both historical and unprecedented nature, each boundary of the Assembly was full of excited hope. There is a freedom to speak which is rarely seen, especially by the representatives of the small countries. The representatives of the major countries are often restricted by various difficulties in the long experience of international mediation, but the representatives of small countries do not have them. They often supply problems of conversation by the other side, so as to express China's observation point in the current dispute. In addition, a document was circulated, emphatically stating that China is now a fortress guarded by the small countries. In recent days, the mist caused by the startling news from the Far East cleared in the morning with a telegram from Tokyo, saying that peace, in any case, a temporary peace, has been planned in Shanghai. Before the meeting, all seats in the meeting room were full. The audience seats and the seats specially reserved for diplomatic representatives were also full of people. Most noteworthy is the presence of the entire US delegation to the Disarmament Conference to attend as observers. Peng Gu stood up to briefly describe the situation in the Far East, slightly revealing the painful situation that caused the special meeting of the Assembly to be convened, saying that the troubled land is far from Geneva, and the complicated situation there makes the solution difficult. Peng Gu recognized this as an expression of gratitude for the cooperation of American friendship, saying that the whole world is today in critical condition, and a cannon fired on the shores of the Pacific will shake Europe, just as Sarajevo opened with a pistol and brewed a world war. Peng Gu then defended the League of Nations, saying that although the League of Nations acted slowly, it has stopped the nature of the war in the Far East from becoming heavier and its scope expanding. The League of Nations' Committee of Inquiry has been led by British Lord Lytton to the Far East, which is an important achievement of the League of Nations. Peng Gu then commented on the criticism of the League of Nations for being slow in handling matters, saying that one of the reasons for the slowness is the need to consult with the United States, which has never been stingy in providing assistance. Peng Gu then described the relationship between Article 11 and Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant and the Sino-Japanese dispute, and extremely stated that the League of Nations Administrative Council should bring its efforts to the utmost in response to China's application, saying that the Administrative Council also cited Article 10, and repeatedly declared to the two parties the meaning under that article. Peng Gu said that Article 10 is the basis for resolving current and future disputes. Peng Gu then praised Sir Simon and the British government, and the Commander-in-Chief of the British Fleet in China</p>
<p>Sir Kelley's efforts to make the Sino-Japanese compromise on the spot, then detailed the situation in Shanghai, saying that there is a need to consider this dispute in accordance with Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant. Peng Gu also praised Sato's wisdom in handling the dispute in the Administrative Council, and then said, "We must see this matter through, and we really intend to proceed in this way. The League of Nations must be able to gain strength as a result of the current dispute." Peng Gu continued to say that the League of Nations has now accepted what was previously rejected, and then briefly described the ceasefire plan, solemnly saying, "I learned this morning that the offensive in Shanghai has stopped, and the acceptance of the ceasefire has created a more hopeful position than when the Assembly was convened. The Administrative Council has maintained one of the most important things in the world, which is honor." Peng Gu's speech was greatly welcomed by the audience, and applause and cheers rose from the audience. Then Foreign Minister Hymans, who was elected Speaker of the Assembly, gave a short speech, comparing the first Assembly he chaired in 1920 with the practical application of the League of Nations.</p>
<p>Continued to cut the words this meeting has undertaken a major responsibility, saying that the end of hostilities, can enable the Assembly to discuss in a peaceful atmosphere, and generate a hope that the Assembly can make a lasting solution to this long-running dispute. Hymans then proposed that in order to form the largest delegation in the Assembly's internal office, it was proposed to elect eight deputy speakers, which was approved by the Assembly, and Peng Gu (France 45 votes), Mater (Belgium 44 votes), Remell (Sweden 43 votes), Simon (England 43 votes), Grandi (Italy 40 votes), Watergar (Mexico 39 votes), Blair Ning (Germany 37 votes), and Sebah Por (Persia 36 votes) were elected as Deputy Speakers.

<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Assembly extended the meeting from just after 1:30 to 4:30, so that the representatives could study the historical data issued this morning, including the evidence and attachments investigated by the consuls in Shanghai, and a large book report printed with maps.

<h3>League of Nations Administrative Council Chairman Urges Japan to Ceasefire</h3>
<p>Deadline for Reply Before Special Assembly Opening</p>
<p>Yan Huiqing Presents Important Explanation</p>
<p>(Geneva) League of Nations sources here tonight received news from Shanghai that although the 19th Route Army has retreated to 20 kilometers outside of Shanghai, the Japanese military authorities are still not prepared to accept the ceasefire proposal of British Admiral Sir Kelly, and immediately cease hostile actions. There is an unavoidable sense of worry. Council Chairman Peng Chun tonight sent an urgent telegram to Tokyo, requesting that Japan reply to the League of Nations regarding the situation in Shanghai before noon on Thursday (Geneva time), and also requesting that all hostile actions be stopped before the opening of the League of Nations Special Assembly at 4 p.m. on Thursday (Geneva time). (2nd National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Following instructions from Tokyo, Japanese Chief Delegate Sato notified League of Nations Council Chairman Peng Chun this morning that the Japanese government is prepared to send a representative to the British flagship HMS Kent in Shanghai at noon on Thursday, in the presence of Admiral Taylor and Minister Lambson, to discuss peace terms with Chinese representatives. According to the Japanese delegate's notification, this is in response to Peng Chun's telegram requesting the Japanese government to cease hostile actions in Shanghai. (3rd National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Chinese Chief Delegate Dr. Yan submitted a statement to the League of Nations Administrative Council today, with all necessary documents attached, in accordance with the provisions of Article 15 of the Charter. This statement was subsequently released to the press, and its striking lines read: "We are now at a crossroads. Before us, there is only the decision of peace or war. There is no other way. If Japan prevails, then its militarism and brutal force will dominate international affairs. If a new order must be preserved, then now is the time to uphold it. Japan's opposition to public opinion and its use of force are incompatible with the new order of the world as enshrined in solemn treaties. The hope of the civilized world now rests on solemn treaties. China cannot believe that it is making a great mistake in relying on the Charter, which was created at the cost of ten million dead and thirty million wounded, and which is supported by fifty-five nations." In the afternoon, the Japanese delegate also issued a document, calling it a memorandum of explanation, stating that Japan does not recognize the legality of applying Article 15 of the Charter. The original text of this memorandum has not yet been published. Chairman Peng Chun has sent a letter to Japanese delegate Sato, stating that the round table conference proposed by the Chairman is aimed at the cessation of war, and requesting active efforts to end the war before the opening of the League of Nations Assembly tomorrow. (2nd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The introduction to the statement submitted by China to the League of Nations meeting solemnly declares that the fundamental issue of the League of Nations meeting is to resolve Sino-Japanese relations in order to restore permanent peace in the Far East, with particular emphasis on the issue of the northeastern provinces. It further states that immediate attention should be paid to the cessation of hostilities in order to discuss the main issues. The situation this time is serious. It is no exaggeration to say that it is the worst of all international panics since 1914. There is no doubt that Japan is the culprit for the hostile actions, and Article 15 of the Covenant, which is the cornerstone of the League of Nations Covenant, has now been brutally destroyed. As a member of the League of Nations, Japan's recognition of Article 15 is unconditional, just as its full acceptance of the other articles of the Covenant. Now it has invaded 200,000 square miles of Chinese territory and bombed Shanghai and Nanjing. This is what China cannot but expose to the world. Japan says that it used this method because the Chinese refused to buy Japanese goods and did not welcome the Japanese army's invasion of Chinese territory. Therefore, Japan's actions cannot be regarded as acts of aggression. This is tantamount to saying that a country can send troops to invade foreign territory, as long as it declares to the outside world that it has no territorial ambitions, then its actions are not acts of aggression. This kind of argument is too strange. For the sake of the League of Nations, if Japan is not punished, then it can only change its covenant into a declaration, saying that whether a country's actions are acts of aggression should be determined freely by the country that caused the incident. In this case, the League of Nations' saying of "guaranteeing peace" can be changed to "rewarding war." The statement concludes that China has always believed that the League of Nations is a guarantor of international order and justice, and has always respected the League of Nations Covenant, and its request for assistance from the League of Nations is also sincere. In this extremely obvious and urgent situation, it still hopes that the League of Nations will exercise all its powers to immediately stop Japan's hostile and aggressive acts, so that the Japanese army</p>
<p>withdraws from Chinese territory as soon as possible, and uses peaceful methods to resolve the entire Sino-Japanese dispute. (2nd Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Chinese representative Yan Huiqing received reporters and handed over the statement submitted by China to the League of Nations to the representatives, and explained in public the reasons for China's request to convene a special assembly, stating that China and Japan will never give up any rights granted by the Covenant, and that the development of the Sino-Japanese dispute has reached such a degree that China believes that all members of the League of Nations should be able to freely express their opinions on the extreme seriousness of the conflict in the Far East in the Assembly. The statement of the Chinese delegation totals 48 pages, a grand volume, divided into an introduction, a summary of the incident, a summary of Japan's claims, and a conclusion, with eight kinds of attachments, including important documents, such as the formal declarations of the Chinese, Japanese, and American governments regarding the 1915 agreement (i.e., the Twenty-One Demands) at the Washington Conference in 1922, and various declarations issued by the Chinese government due to the organization of the puppet government in Manchuria. The introduction to the Chinese statement specifically stated that the Sino-Japanese conflict, from whatever perspective it is viewed, has been submitted to the League of Nations for its handling, and the effectiveness of the League of Nations can be seen from this crisis. If any part of Chinese territory is threatened by Japanese military occupation, then there is no communication between China and Japan. The final resolution of Sino-Japanese relations must be in accordance with the principles of the League of Nations Covenant, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Pact of Paris. The Japanese delegation also submitted a memorandum to the League of Nations Secretariat, describing the facts to be discussed at the special assembly, the content of which is a report on the Sino-Japanese incident, in which the dissatisfaction of Japanese expatriates in China and the refutation of Japan's claims against China are listed.

<p>After Our Army Retreats</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Still Attempting Deeper Advance</h3>
<p>Statement by Army Ministry Spokesman</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The saying that the Japanese army has received instructions that even though the Chinese army has been forced to retreat to 12 and a half miles away, the Japanese army must still advance until a ceasefire treaty is agreed upon, cannot be confirmed. It is widely believed that this saying has no basis, because the Japanese commander has repeatedly stated that he does not want to pursue the Chinese army beyond an average distance of 12 and a half miles. However, for strategic reasons, it may be necessary to advance slightly at a certain location. (3rd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today, an Army Ministry spokesman told a Reuters reporter that after the Chinese army is driven out about 20 kilometers, the Japanese army intends to stop advancing, but due to terrain conditions, it may be necessary to advance slightly at a certain location. If the Chinese army does not want to counterattack, then the Japanese army will not need to advance after that. (3rd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a certain important source, the Japanese army in Shanghai will withdraw in three stages: (1) immediately take a defensive line about 20 kilometers from Shanghai; (2) once the method of guarding the neutral zone is agreed upon, they will withdraw to the Shanghai and Wusong areas; (3) once the situation permits, they will completely withdraw to Japan.

<h3>Yan Huiqing Expresses Acceptance of Ceasefire Proposal</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Chinese Chief Delegate Dr. Yan Huiqing sent a letter to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, accepting the ceasefire proposal formulated on the British fleet flagship HMS Kent in Shanghai based on the principle of simultaneous withdrawal of troops by both sides. The letter stated that although the Japanese army later took a larger-scale offensive, China is still prepared to accept this proposal. If it can be implemented, China is willing to accept the Secretary-General's proposal of February 29 and participate in the Shanghai conference, but it must be stated that the conference is limited to restoring peace in Shanghai, and all other disputes between China and Japan should be resolved in accordance with the procedures set by the League of Nations. (3rd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Chinese Chief Delegate Yan Huiqing told an Associated Press reporter today that he must agree on more practical measures than the current ceasefire proposal before he can have no doubts about recent developments. The news that Shanghai has already achieved a ceasefire has not yet been confirmed. He has received more than one message of cessation of hostilities recently, so this kind of sudden news makes him doubtful. According to the report he received, the Japanese army has occupied an advantageous position, but he has not yet received a report on what kind of impact this will have on China's policy. He also said that he does not yet know whether the basic conditions recently proposed by Japan can be accepted by the Chinese government, but he can say for sure that any honorable solution will be accepted by Nanjing.

<p>Our Army Retreats from Shanghai and Wusong</p>
<h3>Gains International Acclaim</h3>
<p>The Bravery of the Chinese Army Will Never Fade</p>
<p>Final Honor Still Belongs to China</p>
<p>(Berlin) This morning, all German newspapers considered the withdrawal of the Chinese army from Wusong and Zhabei for strategic reasons to be of great political importance, and unanimously stated that the honor of the war still belongs to the Chinese army. The 19th Route Army was able to resist an enemy with far superior weaponry for thirty-four days, and its bravery and courage will always exist, and nothing can diminish it. The Berliner Tageblatt commented that the Chinese army's withdrawal before the Japanese army's encirclement operation had even begun was the most appropriate time. If they had continued to defend to the death, it would have been of no practical benefit, nor would it have been able to increase the prestige of the 19th Route Army. Finally, it said that if the Japanese authorities can keep their word, then peace can be achieved in a relatively short period of time. The Chinese army's withdrawal at this time is obviously a political action, showing that the Chinese government is prepared to obtain an honorable peace. The Posen Tageszeitung also predicted that peace could be seen soon, but said that the Shanghai incident may not be resolved by simply signing a treaty, and predicted the national reaction to the thirty-four days of fierce fighting, believing that no matter what the outcome of the undeclared war in Shanghai is, its direct result has placed China at the threshold of a new era. The newspaper also attached great importance to the Chinese government's decision to resume diplomatic relations with Russia, saying that once a Sino-Russian alliance is formed, it may become a threat to the world. (3rd National Telegram)</p>
<p>The London Morning Post's editorial this morning stated that in terms of saving face, the retreat of the Chinese army and the advance of the Japanese army have obviously improved their positions. The Chinese army is now outside of 20 kilometers (i.e., 12 and a half miles), which has fulfilled one of the ceasefire conditions. The Chinese army may say that it was not driven out, but retreated on its own, and the Japanese army may also say that the conditions it requested have been fulfilled by the Chinese army. The newspaper also said that this matter can save Geneva's face, because when the League of Nations Council meets, it may see that both sides are more likely to discuss the scope than before, and make Japan recognize the ceasefire it has proposed.

<h3>Lindbergh Kidnapping Case</h3>
<p>Ransom Demanded: US$50,000</p>
<p>Police Have Clues</p>
<p>In the Lindbergh kidnapping case in New York, police have obtained two clues. Last night, the New York branch of a Philadelphia newspaper received a phone call, saying that Lindbergh's child was safe and sound, and that he was being taken care of by an experienced nurse. Who made the phone call is still unknown. At the same time, the post office found an unsigned postcard addressed to Lindbergh, which read, "The child is fine. Wait for instructions to follow." In the world's most bizarre kidnapping case, these are the only two clues the police have obtained. Lindbergh's wife is now pregnant and is trying to suppress her sorrow over the loss of her beloved son, but hopes that the kidnappers will treat her son kindly, so she publishes a detailed list of the food her child eats every day in the newspaper, hoping that the kidnappers will see it and follow it. (3rd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>The kidnapping of the son of New York aviator Lindbergh has aroused national anger. The child is only one year and seven months old and was kidnapped by bandits using a ladder to sneak into the room between 7:30 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. on Tuesday. At the time, there was no sound, and it seemed that the child was still sleeping soundly when he was kidnapped. Several hours later, Lindbergh's wife entered the room and did not see her son, and was greatly shocked. The police received the report and immediately telegraphed the whole country to investigate strictly. Today, two airplanes equipped with cameras took photographs of the area several square miles around Lindbergh's residence in order to find traces of the kidnappers. The police are now paying attention to the aviation port and have ordered gasoline outlets in several states to pay attention to cars. At the same time, hundreds of police officers are searching in various places near Lindbergh's residence. It is widely believed that the kidnappers may try to escape to Canada, so there are people strictly checking in all places leading to Canada, and Canadian officials are also assisting in the matter. It is reported that the kidnappers are demanding a ransom of US$50,000. (3rd Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Russian and American Attitudes Toward Japan</h3>
<p>▲The Commander of the Russian Red Army Issues a Warning</p>
<p>The Japanese Manchuria Daily News carried a telegram from Khabarovsk stating that the Soviet Russian government has appointed Belozyersky as the Commander-in-Chief of the Far Eastern Red Guards, who issued a warning, saying, "Upon the order of the Soviet Russian government, Russia will never allow imperialists to trample on our territory. All our Soviet Russian people should focus on their work and business, and our Far Eastern troops should strictly guard the borders. If imperialists covet our resources and products, or invade our territory, our army will severely punish them."</p>
<p>▲Karakhan Pays Attention to Japan's Actions</p>
<p>The Japanese Hochi Shimbun carried a telegram from Moscow stating that the Soviet Russian government is greatly dissatisfied with Japan's policy toward Manchuria, considering it a violation of treaties. Karakhan specially summoned Hirota, the Japanese ambassador to Russia, urging Japan to reflect deeply on: 1) Japan's actions in North Manchuria trampling on the Chinese Eastern Railway; 2) Japan supplying arms and protecting White Russian activities in Manchuria, for which there is clear evidence; 3) Japan instigating the organization of an independent state of Manchuria, and requesting Japan to explain the nature of the government; 4) Accusing Japan of infringing on fishing rights.</p>
<p>▲American Boycott of Japanese Goods Movement</p>
<p>The Tokyo Hochi Shimbun stated that the movement to boycott Japanese goods, which originated in China and has spread to the United States across the Pacific Ocean, is becoming increasingly fierce. Although it is difficult to predict whether this anti-Japanese trend will continue in the long term, recently, American women's organizations have formed groups to reject Japanese silk products, causing unlimited pain to our economic sector. Therefore, since the United States has implemented a boycott, the Japanese people should be adequately prepared, etc.</p>
<h3>Talks of Wang Jingwei, Feng Yuxiang, Yu Youren, et al. Passing Through Xuzhou</h3>
<p>▲Wang said the Central Government has deployed many reinforcements to Shanghai.</p>
<p>▲Feng proposed a military plan at the Second Plenary Session.</p>
<p>▲Yu said that sending troops to recover the Northeast cannot be delayed any longer.</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: Wang Jingwei, because the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang will be held in Luoyang on March 1st, departed from Shanghai on a special train at 8:30 p.m. on February 26th and arrived in Xuzhou at 8:20 a.m. on the 27th. The train consisted of thirteen carriages. Those traveling with him included He Yingqin, Zhu Peide, Chu Minyi, Gu Mengyu, Chen Bijun, etc. Wang made a speech on the train, briefly stating that this time Japan had presented us with an ultimatum regarding the Shanghai incident, the most unreasonable part of which was the dismantling of the Wusong Forts, which we cannot acknowledge. This is even more severe than the measures taken against us by the Eight-Nation Alliance during the Boxer Rebellion. During the Boxer Rebellion, foreigners still had some excuse against us, but Japan's actions in Shanghai are purely oppression and provocation against us. How can they, on the contrary, make unreasonable demands of us? Therefore, the international community expresses sympathy for us. Due to its relationship with the Conservative Party, Britain is still making great efforts to mediate the Sino-Japanese incident. In addition to the 19th Route Army, many reinforcements have been deployed to Shanghai to defend ourselves, and it is difficult to predict the future of the military situation. However, considering the Northeast Incident, Japan occupied our 3,000 square miles of territory within 24 hours. The Shanghai Incident has already lasted for a month, and the Japanese army has not made any progress, which may be the effect of great resistance. However, our side will never adopt a declaration of war against Japan. According to principles of justice, we are simply resisting and defending ourselves. Even judging from the advantages and disadvantages, Japan has mobilized five divisions of its 17 standing divisions to the Northeast and three divisions to Shanghai. In the future, they can only sporadically draw troops from within the country separately, and cannot formally declare war and make a general mobilization to attack us. Japan is acting against us with strength exceeding a declaration of war, precisely hoping that we will propose a declaration of war and sever diplomatic relations, so that they can exaggerate their words at the League of Nations, claiming that we opened the dispute. Their plan is extremely cunning, and their intentions are extremely malicious. How can we fall into their trap? As for the puppet state in the Northeast, if it declares its establishment, the Central Government will never condone it and will immediately order a crusade to eliminate the traitors and recover lost territory, to protect the integrity of our land sovereignty. No one can protect or interfere with our traitors. Although the Northeast is a border province, its territory can never be easily ceded to others. As for financial issues related to the military, there are also appropriate measures. The first phase of the reorganization plan has been completed, and the second phase of the new plan is also being implemented, and we can have a firm grasp of both. The League of Nations meeting on March 3rd will have a substantial discussion on the Sino-Japanese incident. The Second Plenary Session of our country on March 1st will also make a comprehensive decision on domestic affairs. It is hoped that the people of the country will unite as one, with determination and perseverance, and persist forever, etc.</p>
<p>At this time, Feng Yuxiang's special train also arrived successively. Feng's train consisted of eight carriages, departing from Shanghai at 9:20 p.m. on the 26th and arriving at the station thirty minutes later than Wang's train at 8:20 a.m. on the 27th. Because Feng was not fully recovered from illness, he sent Li Xingzhong to meet the guests. After Feng's train entered the station, Wang's special train departed for Luoyang at 9:10 a.m., and Feng's train left Xuzhou westward at 10:10 a.m. Feng's representative, Li Xingzhong, told reporters that Mr. Feng had no separate statement to make, taking Mr. Wang's meaning as his own. However, regarding the Northeast, he absolutely advocates sending troops to recover the lost territory. This time, attending the Second Plenary Session will involve a military plan regarding the resistance against Japan, which cannot yet be announced, etc.</p>
<p>Yu Youren, Ju Zheng, Chen Guofu, Chen Lifu, Xiao Jishan, Xiao Zhongzhen, Chen Zhaoying, Shi Ying, Zeng Yangfu, Cheng Tianfang, Wang Qi, Gu Zhenggang, Huang Jichen, etc., also took the Pu-Luo through train from Beijing to Luoyang via Xuzhou on the morning of the 27th. On the train, Ju discussed that the Central Government's policy toward Japan would be in accordance with Mr. Wang's principle of "resisting on one hand and negotiating on the other." However, diplomacy does not yet have any great power and cannot but rely on military strength. Since Shanghai has already made efforts to resist, sending troops to the Northeast to recover lost territory can absolutely no longer be delayed. Sending troops to the Northeast has become the unanimous call of the entire country, and the press should widely propagate this to the people, etc. Soon, Ju and others also went west to the capital.
