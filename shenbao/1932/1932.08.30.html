<h3>中國内戰與生活缺憾</h3>
<p>梓</p>
<p>生物學家認一九一四年之歐洲大戰。爲確乎由歐人腦與手發達之結果易言之。即由其生活進化之缺憾所造成也。中國二十年來之國内戰爭。非由於中國人腦與手之發達。此爲顯然之事實。而中國内戰之發生。與中國人生活進。化所具之缺憾之關係。則頗有必。須闌明之價値也。</p>
<p>中國爲政。向以四。境寗謐民物相安爲正鵠。但二十年來之全國紛擾民不聊生。依事實所昭示。其風浪多由各地爲政者所掀起。此無他。中國當局者。一方不能脫家族主義之舊時生活。買田宅養子孫之事。日日縈於腦際方則受西洋物質生活之誘惑。窮奢極侈。不能以舊傳節儉之美德。輔其家族主義之完成。由此兩種新舊生活並營之矛盾。刺激其慾望。助長其野心。於是各欲藉其所有之武力。以解决其生活缺憾之問題。而内戰以起。</p>
<p>西方人之享樂生活。與產業之發達資本主義之進步。相輔而行。故其享樂生活。與政治。與軍事。並無若何之妨害。中國素藉作官以求最高之生活。國内有相當之智識能力者。相率竸爭於宦海。所爲何來。生活問題而已。民國成立以來。官爲公僕之語雖曾著之於紙上之文章。而實則作官者。仍多具舊時謀取最高生活之目的。以翼獲得新式之享樂生活。官吏之收入有度。而享樂生活之所需無窮。於是或感其地盤之狹小。或憾其權力之有限力謀發展互相衝突。而内戰以起。</p>
<p>内戰與生活缺憾之關係。可　發者正多。茲不過就近日廢止内戰大同盟代表大會中所注意之内戰範圍。加以說明。以示二十年來内戰根本問題之所在耳。今觀廢止内戰大同盟章程第二條所定進行之程序。一宣布内戰罪惡於平時。是欲以道德之力廢止内戰也。二糾紛發生時向雙方勸吿調處是欲以感情之作用廢止内戰也三。内戰發生時拒絶合作。是欲以第三者之力遏止内戰也。此三種方法。臨時相機應用。或不無若干之效力惟欲以此根本消澸内戰。則恐尙非所能。廢戰大同盟之作用。如所表示。爲恩内爭以禦外侮其章程規定機關或立期爲五年。旦得提前解散。或者爲應付目前緊急之環境。不得不定迅速有效之應急辦法。亦未可知。但吾人爲謀永久消弭内戰計終以爲從生活進化之調和。謀根本之解决。更爲切要也。</p>

<h3>沈鴻烈擴展海軍工廠計畫</h3>
<p>决定建築船熓一處</p>
<p>推定太平灣爲熓址</p>
<p>青島通訊、東北海軍修理工廠、民國十七年成立於青島、先是東北海軍所屬各船、　有損壤或機械發生障碍、多由外人工廠承修、而彼等任意居奇、歷年修費已屬不貨、况世界各國、凡屬海軍根據地、莫不有相當之設備、而修理工廠、尤爲急不容緩之舉、蓋一旦有事、萬不能仰給於外人也、東北海軍司令沈鴻烈有見及此、爰有海軍工廠之設、　　經營、迄今四載、始有今日之成績、茲將其沿革及將來建設計畫、略誌於次、</p>
<p>▲工廠沿革　民十七夏、沈命海軍司令部輪機長高鳳華負責籌設工廠、並命兼任廠長、撥開辦費二萬二千元、盤買日人豐盛公司舊廠機器、就原有廠址、幾經整頓修葺、方始就緒、廠内組織設廠長一員、佐理員二員、爲節省經費起見、俱兼差不另支薪、並設總監工技士、技手書記管庫諸員額、及領班八名、工兵三十二名、每月員工薪餉額支二千零十元、由海軍總司令部開支、至十九年度預算始增領班爲九名、工兵爲五十六名、月支薪餉三千六百四十三元五角、復於二十年十二月設專任廠長、以專責成、二十一年二月、增設技師辦事員等員額、增加預算爲三千九百五十七元五角、此工廠成立之槪略也、該廠雖因經費關係、船熓尙未建築、然各艦艇除水線以下工程無法修理外、其餘無論大小工程、俱能自修、三年來節省費用不在少數、至修理工程、則先估預算呈部核准、俟完工後、再憑决算核計實用工料、領取修費、較他廠所需低昂懸殊、嗣因工程漸多、廠址不敷應用、經海軍司令部與青島當局屢次交涉、遂於民十八五月遷入現在廠址、（卽前德人魚雷工廠舊址）此處地面寛闊、規模粗　、且逼近海沿、各艦艇　隨時停泊工廠碼頭、施工修理、運輸便利、頗爲絶濟、維時沈司令以該軍無線電台、尙付闕如、乃於十八年度工廠編制内、增設電氣工程師一員附設無線電機工廠、十九年度增設電氣技士二員、專任長短波無綫電工作、爲時未久東北各艦、各機關、如青島·　寗·長山島·哈爾濱·威海衛等處、悉裝置無綫電台、大者可以直通歐美、而青島中府各機關亦紛紛請求代爲交設、博山煤礦公司亦購兩部、膠</p>

<h3>接要聞</h3>
<p>路四方公園購收音機一具、均比較價廉而物美、成效卓著、嗣因該無綫電機工廠擴充編制、於二十一年二月奉令改稱爲海軍無綫電台、又該廠工作除修理各艦艇外、兼及外界營業、綜計各艦艇已竣工修費、十八年約七萬五千元、十九年約九萬元、二十年約十三萬元、營字號已竣工程修費、十八年約一千二百元、十九年約三千六百元二十年約八千元、以是工程愈繁、額定工兵愈感不敷、酌量工作情形、添僱臨時工人數十名至百數十名不等、以補助工作、至廠產之購置、除原購有豐盛公司舊廠機器外、復添置空氣縮壓機、揷床·洗床·車床·砲床·鋸床·及其他機件多種、並蓋造木料倉庫、及職員宿舍、晒圖室各一所、以上購置各費、均係由修費贏餘内、盡量撥用、故能有如是之成績也、</p>
<p>▲擴展計畫　沈司令以海軍工廠雖規模粗具、惟船塢尙未添設、引爲極大憾車、於是最近决定建築船塢、已命該廠高廠長籌畫一切、並指定廠門首太平灣爲塢址、至是項經費、决定以塢址外之海灣、招商塡築、一俟完成、卽行競租、以所獲之租金、充作建築經費、又政記輪船公司及本市巨商、均願投資共成此舉、將來此事不難實現蓋船塢落成後、不但可修理船隻、卽新造艦艇、亦可勝任、鞏固國防提倡航業、繁榮青市、胥賴於是、又該廠預定計畫、俟船塢告成後、擬再添設大規模翻沙廠一所、鍋爐廠一所、機器鋸木廠一所、排船樣廠一所、造新船台一所、以上計畫、期以三年、次第完成、（八月二十六日）</p>

<p>對於大學訓育的蠡見</p>
<p>邵鳴九</p>
<p>大學訓育、在大學行政組織系統上佔一個很重要的地位　這不消說的、可是如何纔能收到實效、這個問題、却不容易解决了、我國中小學校、對於訓育組織和方法、都還研究如何改進、遇到新的較好的方法、都很願意接收、而且實地去證騐、所以近年來中小學訓育、確能表現幾分進步、講到大學呢、那就有點懹疑了、老實說、我國大學訓育方面、到了現在、並沒有甚麽長進、這是普遍的現象、並不是專指那一個地方、或是那一個學校、更不是指那一個訓育先生、我很希望大學一致努力去研究、尤其是在大敎育不發達的中國、對於大學訓育的組織和方法、格外要多多研究、那麽纔能收到良好效果、也纔能夠提起學生對於訓育的注意、如今我且把大學訓育應當改革的三點意見、和大家討論、</p>
<p>（一）打破主任制的訓育組織</p>
<p>現在我國一般大學校、對於訓育的組織、都沒有一定標準、只好各自爲政、據我所知道的、大學訓育組織的名稱、總是有下列三種現象、（一）主任制、（二）委員制、（三）導師制、這幾種組織裏面、委員制和導師制、姑且不說單講主任制一層、我覺得許多弊病、第一訓育主任職權、未必能貫澈、第二訓育處、太注重規章細則、事事有牽制、少伸縮餘地、第三訓育處和各院缺少聯絡的機會、所以辦事效力也就减輕、第四師生間少接觸機會、所以容易發生誤會、第五偏重訓育處的行政事宜缺少提倡學術研究或者鼓勵技術發明、第六單獨組織訓育處經費和才力都覺不妥當、所謂訓育這回事、已經墮爲一種在一定的組織之下照規定而運行的機械式的事業了、我認爲大學的訓育組織、宜乎根據學生生活爲原則、改主任爲指導員人數看學校組織範圍大小而定、組織旣覺簡易、而辦事比較迅速、才能避免組織太嚴的弊病、所以近年來各大學裏面、漸漸傾向新組織了、（未完）</p>

<h3>游泳速成術</h3>
<p>俞斌祺</p>
<p>我們若然以生理學眼光看起來、人類學習游泳、似乎是一椿違背情理的妄舉、誰都明白的、魚類是不能離開水、一旦離水、在空氣當中、就要畢命了、反轉來說人類是全恃空氣而生存、若然一旦離開了空氣、到水裏去、那不是也要像魚類離開了水到空氣中的一樣要畢命嗎、可是事實是不是這樣的、因爲人是萬物之　、只要你想得到、有志去學他、什麽都會成功的、游泳雖屬小道、但是關係於人生、家庭·和國家、却是至大且切哩、關於這一點有益人生、國家的詳細理由請你們參閱二十一年八月十七日的申報和十八日的時事新報上發表的斌祺等致敎育部全國體育會議會通電中、就可以明瞭游泳是我們當務之急了、以近年統計起了、國人對游泳的興趣、是乎很是濃厚、試觀在上海明園·在虹口·在東亞、每晨到晩、熙來攘往、非常踴躍、這當然是體育界的好現像、可是他們或她們、雖然抱著十二分的堅志、鼓勵著奮勇、去學習游泳、但是沒有相當的訓練和指導、摸不著頭路般的瞎撞、終究是難易入門、所以有些人、心有餘而力不足、只好望水興嘆了、承同志們不棄、時常接到各團體的來函、要我抽暇指導、我對於這種委任、非常是不敢婉辭、並且是十分高興、可惜我太忙了、自慮分身乏術、事實上不能夠可以使面面顧到、我在抱歉之餘、在這裏供獻你們的一條游泳的捷徑、倘使你讀熟了、明白了、到游泳池裏依我的捷徑去實習、我可擔保在一小時内、包你可以自動的游泳了、一個從來沒有到過水裏的人、他看見人家游泳大槪會說這是一椿很容易的事、這眞所謂看人挑擔弗喫力、若是下了水、水到了胸部、那末身體就要蕩浮起來、胸中的五臟六肺、似乎也浮起來的一般、因爲呼吸短促、就有氣急的狀態顯露出來、這種情形下的初學者、若不用再一步一步的指導他、怎呌他會和水奮鬥呢、所以游泳基本方式、就是爬泳、學會了爬泳、就有基礎了、以後要學起别的姿勢來、就可按圖索驥、迎刄解决了、爬泳的練習法、可分三步、就是打水划手換氣、初次入水的人、呌他好端端的站著、或許還要感到各種的窘狀、我上面已竞講過了、若是你呌他蹺起脚來打水、那眞是嚇得他不敢嘗試了、這是什麽緣故呢、因爲普通人、打水的法子是用雙手攀住了池欄、伸直了手、伸直了手、再來打水、照這個法子、呌初次下水的人、去練習、那眞是太覺高深了、我可武斷的說一句話、卽使有游泳天才的人照這種法子來學、他的兩隻脚、决計不能伸得直、和提得起的、若然初學的人、靠近了池邊、先將右手爪住了池邊的石欄、左手伸入水中、約距離水上八吋、手指朝下的倒托住了池墻、然後將身體挺直、成水平線、二足再宜伸直、藉二手之托力、將挺直的身體浮起來、一上一下的打水、打水的動作、僅是用著小腿打起來、最好是像發抖的一般、可以省却許多氣力、倘使右手爪住池邊石欄、左手朝下倒托、而身體仍是不能浮起、那末以將爪住游泳池石槽的右手、將手臂向下、用手臂靠住池邊、下面的左手、仍是照樣的倒托、照這個辦法、那怕是一個絶頂大胖的大塊頭、也可擔保輕易的身體浮起來了、這個秘訣是我從歷年實中得來、遍閱中西關於游泳的書籍、是沒有論及、所以我認爲是初學游泳的第一步最便利的捷徑、是練習打水、須要忍耐、因爲呆板沒趣、因而中輟、這是最不好的心理、一定要練習得純熟而自然、至雙手可以不用氣力的打水爲止、</p>

<p>▲蔡談閩事　又據蔡廷鍇氏語新聲社記者云、關於閩省剿匪計畫、現已完全决定、此次到京後、即將赴漢謁蔣委員長報吿、但今日一到京後、能否確可成行、尙須視時間是否充足而定、至閩省財政及改組省府事、在滬未談到、回滬期間、雖未確定、然亦爲時不久、但另據與蔡偕行之陸文瀾談、關於閩財政事、此次蔡氏到滬、與宋財長接洽後、宋氏已允每月接濟五十萬元、又有在蔡氏　未來滬前由本人代向宋氏接洽之特别費二十萬元、預計尙短絀十萬元、籌措當非難事、改組閩省府事、在滬未談及、俟謁蔣後、可望有所决定、范其務氏對担任閩財政專員事、因范係自已人、大約可允負責、陳眞如因出洋意堅、不致赴閩、至剿匪計畫、已完全决定、謁蔣時可當面報吿云、</p>

<p>▲溺斃五命　小民船一艘被撞沉後、江天船主欽友玉得知、急令停車、派全船船員下极板撈救落水之人、結果船身已破毁沉失、毫無踪跡、在江内僅救起小孩兩名、一十七歲一十五歲、聲稱姓詐、民船即其父所有者、今老父已落水矣、船内尚有搭客楊老三等男女四名、亦遭溺斃、船由劉家渡運蘆蓆等到姚家溝云云、江天輪以溺斃之人、尸體無法打撈、遂開往劉家渡、</p>

<p>兒子出生日期</p>
<p>引起聽衆軒渠</p>
<p>法官希望和解</p>
<p>免爲報紙資料</p>
<p>一女雙夫事蹟曲折離奇之三角戀愛訟案、昨日午後二時、由第一特區地方法院傅琳推事開第四法庭繼續訊理、葉理紹以刑事自訴徐曁平（又名徐仲羲　主婚詐欺取財等情案、兩造當事人各偕代理律師到庭、傅推事先問明原被姓氏、旋對被告徐曁平曰、原告訴汝（一）重婚、（二）詐財、茲查訊所傳證人楊昌熾律師到案否、卽由二五九一號華捕報告往法租界辣斐德路楊律師處傳喚、適楊不在、經其書記代表簽字情形、而原告葉理紹之律師卽稱、查楊律師事務所、今猶在英租界江西路、徐葉所訂離婚據、實係在該律師事務所簽字、故</p>
<p>所訴詐財部份　鈞院確有管轄權、被告律師遂加以辯駁、謂當時離婚據之簽字、究在楊之事務所、抑屬楊之寓所、此點應由楊律師到庭證明、始能確定、傅推事因兩造律師對於此點辯駁無已、遂宣稱律師執行職務、當以事務所爲原則、猶之推事以在衙署辦事爲原則、今被告旣到案、是［所在地］三字、已經確定、</p>
<p>應即進行審理　遂向被告訊問年齡、　　　答稱、二十五歲、原告律師亟起聲明、被告確爲二十八歲、要求命被告誠實陳述、是時徐復要求傳楊昌熾到案作證、謂伊實在法租界楊律師家内簽字也、傅推事乃將法律規定管轄條文重予解釋、彼始默然、卽續向訊據供稱、我於十七年三月二十日、與葉理紹結婚、證婚人爲蔡耀仲·葉同叔、法官乃訊葉以結婚時期、據葉稱、係十六年三月二十日、與徐結婚、地點在杭州滄州飯店、</p>
<p>婚後回至楓涇　原籍、同住一月、遂陪徐赴母家、住約一年、在此期間、我曾往漢口經商、被告則不時赴滬、我祇知係來滬讀書、初固不悉其與胡秉衡已發生關係、我與其未婚之前、已於十六年一月間生有一子、後我由漢口返家、則此子已不見、詢據徐云、子已夭殇、問以尸骸安在、謂已焚化、</p>
<p>至其與胡結婚　據彼在民庭自白、謂係十五年間、其與我離婚之原因、表面爲嫌我家屋小、不願同居、屢由楊律師來函交涉、嗣乃訂立離婚據、給其赡養費一千元、此外並給付端兒撫育欵二百元、今悉端兒非我所生、故控其詐財、共爲一千二百元、端兒出生時期、係在十七年五月五日、</p>
<p>徐曁平聆至此　卽聲稱端兒係十八年五月二十五日出生、原告故意將結婚日期錯誤、於是事事皆錯　旁聽者及兩造律師咸忍俊不置、傅推事亦覺此案殊無價値、乃諭雙方律師　於出外後互勸當事人和解、謂否則纆訟不休、徒爲</p>
<p>報紙造成資料　呈皆身敗名裂、實屬無謂之極、語重心長、聞者多爲動容、庭上因續訊據徐曁平供、我與胡係於十五年結婚、與葉則係十七年結婚、後者乃遵父母之命、前者則係自由戀愛、傅推事遂諭之曰、當汝與葉結婚之時、正婦女運動絶對解放之際、汝爲青年學生、何以猶能恪遵父母之命、徐答稱、此中尙有原因、緣葉母與我母係屬舊友、十四年葉母爲其予向我母求婚、我母允之、是年春、我則與胡</p>
<p>在同學家邂逅　秋間復晤於滬杭車中、時我尙在嘉興讀書、彼此始通書信、次年春、胡乃向我求婚、但我當時主張應爲一夫一妻制、胡亦承諾、至三月二十八日、胡來南車站、邀我往旅館、遂與成婚云云、並對葉所述彼等未婚前徐已生有一子情事、矢口否認　訊至此、雙方律師皆以此案有若干問題、須待民庭之徐胡一案判决後、方能解决、故一致請求延期、惟原告律師則以徐曁平無一定住所、要求諭令交保、傅推事考慮後、决將被告責付其律師、證明下次須遵傳到案、遂准改期再訊、並仍諄勸令出外和解、</p>

<p>自由談	二一枝譚十丈輕綸釣蜜魚  瞻廬　　坐在西園水心亭子中，憑欄品茗，看那三三五五的游魚，坐在玻璃國中，丨這不是玻璃維亞丨結伴往來；這裏面澈底的清，抛下一個銅元，也　得見銅元的着落，而不會有什麽隱蔽。魚的社會是很光明的人的，社會郤大有愧色丨　　旁座的茶客，見魚言魚；或談玉泉的五色魚，或談黃河的鯉魚，不是臨淵羨魚，竟是臨淵談魚；就中有一客，說起四明山中的蜜姑魚，津津有味，値得記錄一下子·　　丨孟老夫子舍魚而取熊掌，他所說的是尋常的魚；他若嘗了四名山中的蜜姑魚；他一定舍熊掌而取魚。　　從光溪入四明山中，約二十餘里，便有一個千尋壁立的蜜巖，下臨着一帶深溪，這是風影最幽雅的所在蜜巖上面，舊有一個其大無比的蜂窠，聚蜂數百萬頭，大約可以算得蜂世界中的一等國丨待到蜂蜜成熟以後，點點滴滴的落在溪中，宛似下了幾陣甜蜜的雨丨溪魚吃了這般甜蜜的水，便起了同化作用，倘把魚兒作鱠，也是甘美無味；不但肉甘而且甘入心肝；又似情書中的戀人，値得喚一聲甜蜜的心肝丨這般的魚，不是輕易可以得到的，其名喚做蜜姑魚；蜜字下面，加一姑字，不但甘美，而且富於女性的美，這眞是魚類中的尤物丨　　釣取蜜姑魚，很費着麻煩的手續；魚性善驚，一觸釣鈎，便即奮命跳躍，往往脫鈎而去。而且蜜巖下面，水清見底；釣者用了粗綸，魚見綸影，便即悠然而逝；用了輕綸，又怕力不足以制魚。於是，取十餘丈的輕綸，繞上竹竿，旣至溪邊，徐徐放絲，魚一上鈎，任彼跳躍，只把竿絲鬆放如放紙鳶一般，待到吞鈎的魚，跳躍力倦，釣者徐徐收絲，便獲得一尾其甘無比的蜜姑魚。　　在座者聽到這裏，舌底下都湧起着甜津津的涎浪丨斷鴻零雁寄征人  石子　　一昨趨訪我友胡日新。胡掌庶務於某校。前以淞滬之戰。某校適當戰區。學生星散。胡乃投效救護隊。度其壕塹生活者凡七星期。於敵兵屍體間。搜得魚雁數十通。日記念餘册。曾倩知日文者爲之迻譯。舉以示我。亟擇其一二。錄如左。無定河邊骨。深閨夢裏人。軍閥黷武。寡人妻。孤人子。古今中外。初無二致也·　　（一）我親愛的丈夫鑒。自上海寄第二次信。已收到。支那兵如此蠻强。誠出人意料之外。君得以微傷而居軍醫院。可謂神明保佑。但願支那兵早日退去。皇軍得於君傷愈之前。進佔支那街。俾君不致再經可怖之惡戰。凱旋而歸。籐原君之死耗。其妻尙未知。惟不接來信已二星期。故其妻焦急萬狀。幸此間風傳皇軍在滬。屢獲勝利。此則即征人之妻。所資爲慰藉者也。我家之店。自君去後。吉田（按恐係店夥）亦即被徵入伍。致無人照顧。加以營業清淡。課稅增加。致無法維持。已於昨日閉歇。待君凱旋時。再謀復業。茲另以郵包寄上絨繩衫袴一套。望服以禦寒。附妾及愛子（按恐係其女）寫眞各一幀。望君善自珍重。爲帝國爭光榮。妻千代。二月二十三日付。　　（二）字付行雄。汝自被徵往滬後。未來隻字。殊令我悶悶。汝兄自被徵往滿洲後。據尾崎宮藏家書稱。已於一月十九日。在吉林剿匪殉國。光榮之戰死。殊可欽敬。汝弟於間島剿匪。已成殘廢。我所生三子。今所望者。惟汝而已。（按。不知此嫗所望於此子者。戰死乎。抑生還乎。然其結局。則三子均爲國犧牲。此嫗亦殊可憫已）。余日來神志恍惚。寢瞶不安。汝若能早日奏旋言凱。則余心滋慰矣。此信到後。須即作復。以慰倚閭。即祝努力。母字。二月二十五日。十九路軍紀念贈章  浣花　　一二八戰役，十九路軍爲爭國家人格，民族生存，而忠勇抗日。當時民衆嘉其眞能爲民前鋒，誓死殺賊，打破歷來軍人自私惡習，遂多不惜慷慨傾囊，捐貲助餉；甚至莘莘學子，罊節衣縮食所積，勞工小販，舉畢生辛苦所得，悉供軍需。此軍民合作精神，足可窺見民衆愛國熱烈，與該軍深得民心之一斑矣丨　　茲該軍以　昔三十餘日光榮戰史之造成，亦有賴於民衆後盾力量。爲酬答義舉計，特製紀念章若干枚，分贈於凡曾捐欵之同胞。章鐵質黑色，所以表示軍民之鐵血代價。章式上爲長僅及寸闊約分許之横額，鑄［淞滬抗日紀念］六字，下繫寳星一顆，背鐫［民國二十一年春蔣光鼎蔡廷鍇戴戟敬贈］諸字。已於本月二十五日起，憑往日捐欵收據，分發給領。　　余竊測該軍贈章用意，固不僅爲普通酬庸性質。其一：使臥薪嘗膽者日夕覩物懷仇，淬勵沼吳之志。其二：此次非常國難，該軍犧牲精神，足資國民禦侮表率。其三：三省失於崇朝，淞滬幸無隕趙，抗敵衛國，惟恃衆志成城，佩章者當益知所奮勉丨至勗激無章者風使愛國，愧彼凉血，尤屬餘事。吾儕得此贈章，宜體念其深意而發揚光大，愼勿等閑視之也。秋風吹去洋四角  閻重樓　　失帽可返人心難測　　這雖然是一件很小的事，然而或者意是社會黑暗的一幕，事實是這樣的：　　昨天我到市商會去領十九路軍所贈的紀念章，經過天后宮橋，忽然一陣風來，我的草帽竟給風吹向橋下去了，我趕急到橋頭張望，還好丨我的帽子落在橋洞裏停着的一個大駁船船頭上，沒有掉下水裏，我正想喊人下船去取帽，一轉眼我的帽子忽然不知所在，問部旁邊的人，他們都說給那駁船上的人拿去了，我於是不得不自已下河，由幾隻小船上渡到那個大駁船上，在那船上有四五個人，我當向他們詢問我失落的帽子，他們却異口同聲的說沒有看見，還有兩個人說：［帽子已經落到水裏，］我這時只有悵望河流，嘆我失帽丨剛想回到岸上，忽然旁邊來了一個人，他自吿奮勇給我去拿帽，不過要我付出代價，這一來使我發生了很大的疑惑：［帽子不是吹到水裏去了？現在去向龍王拿嗎？］但是他旣來吿奮勇，我就拿兩角錢給他，這人拿了錢，他却走到剛剛說帽子已經落到水裏的那個人旁邊，咕噥了半嚮，我的帽子却從船艙底下拿出來，最後當吿奮勇的人拿帽子還我的時候，他的條件是再付兩角錢的酬報……　　已失去的帽子，雖然仍得戴在我的頭上，但是我的心裏却感覺到很大的痛苦，我不是痛心被秋風吹去我的四角錢，而是痛心現在的社會人心竟是這樣的難測！記潮州湘子橋  韓鳳笙　　潮州附近。有石橋曰湘子。跨韓江之畔。起於竹牌門之西。迄韓山止焉。石身長丈餘。厚二尺。枕堰而平鋪。排三方爲一渡。可七尺寛。亘延十二渡。下可通舟。今圯其半矣。相傳爲謪仙韓湘子所建。湘子昌黎之姪。不好學而擅幻術。昌黎刺潮州。湘子隨幕。登山涉水。常數日不歸。其叔尼之。弗聽一夕。風雨大作。江畔彷彿萬人喊呐。滿城靂駭。少年之往視者。出戶而踣。翌日而橋成矣。湘子遂不知所終。此一說也。橋頭有鐵牛一。碩大無朋。相傳昔有二牛。分立左右。右者時蹊禾食麥。農家苦之。向天禱吿。其牛不翼而飛。左者亦深陷。僅露其背。即今存者。兩說俱穿鑿。不可信。然建築之奇。非人力可致。邪說横行。宜其然也。余幕潮州凡四年。薄暮必驅舟至橋下。仰視巨石。爲蜂居蟻窟所据。巉巖可畏。舍舟越石級登橋。堰之上。榕蔭如覆。土人鑿樹而居者數百。韓山書院。昌黎讀書處也。明清爲鄕塾。今改師範。鐘聲時來橋畔。令人懷古不置。潮州產柑甲全國。冬春之交。羣集柑市於韓山。買客越橋而往。中毁數段。渡舟始達。嗚呼。古物且頽危。而無議興葺者。抑今人之力不逮古人歟。余客江南三載。今夏歸而謁橋有感焉。時懼橋之湮沒也。因泚筆記之。大同樂會夜祭二樂家（下）  涵　　濫用感情。作三角之戀愛。鑄成大錯。合二美以同居。臣本布衣。不過草茅一下士。家無擔石。何來金屋貯雙嬌。謬托金夫。能結同心之臭。可憐巧婦。難爲無米之炊。薄命憐卿。甘作聯床之夢。傷心恨我。未加博士之冠。債台高築。藎筐爲空。排闥催科。詞腸屢斷、雙雙倩影。行將吸露餐風。兀兀窮年。何處呼庚乞癸。於是病由貧起。樂極悲生。六根將斷。求藥石兮無靈。二　爲災。嘆膏肓之已人。於是離茲黃浦。適彼黃山。方冀法雨慈雲。藉作驅魔之保障。豈料天尊佛力。仍不能却催命之無常也。前月報載有集鴻病死於安徽黃山某寺。身後蕭條。不堪言狀云云。嗚呼集鴻。其自作之孽耶。抑命犯所遭耶。一坯黃土。長埋地之魂。幾點青燐。永泣無家之鬼。頻年上祀。祭掃何人。來日冬朝。若敖其餒。嗟乎。稽康不幸。太平引絶響人間。（指滿城風雨曲）顏子云亡。復聖操傷心短命。嗚呼噫嘻。悲哉悲哉·集鴻之哀思未晞。而天華之惡耗又相偪而來矣。天華者。吾鄉後起之秀也。學問藝術。均出集鴻上。且留心韻學。意在復興樂府。起千百年聲樂之衰。志量之大。殆無倫比。天華之父名寶山。與余幼同學。長同試。筆下亦不弱。而考運獨慳。每試不售。蓋以課藝終其身焉。天華之兄名半農　亦名下士。昆季久在北華。聲譽甚重。日前有人告余曰。天華以五日疾殁於北平。余未置信。至數日前。於申報自由談見其事。始信其確。嗚呼。以二子之天才。皆足傳樂統之衣鉢。任吾道之干城。前途未可限量。若予者。心長髮短已交風燭之年。絙淺汲深。無復雲覽之望。故予自聆二子之死。不覺腦海欲翻。神經寸亂。慨斯文之將　。倚畀何人。嘆聲敎之式微。載興何日。强有力者尙如此。老而衰者將何爲。嗚呼集鴻。固無論矣。若天華者。律身高潔。常懷白玉之心。操守　嚴。不墜凌雲之志。縱不能如實公之長年。亦何至於鐘期之不壽。所謂天者不可知。而神者誠難明矣。嗚呼哀哉尙饗。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊　言大廉價  佛　　買一瓶送兩瓶丨買一尺送兩尺丨這是現在秋季的當兒，各公司商店大貼其血本大拍賣的標語，拆穿西洋鏡，做商意想些什麽？倘使眞個削本，有多少本錢可削呢？不過利用一般羣衆貪小便宜的心理，實行其薄利多賣主義，吸收些現金，到底本錢依舊本錢，利息儘管利息，　　近代科學精神，側重批判，尼釆所謂［重新估定一切價値］，此語最爲切當而有意義，現在的大廉價，就是這個意思，貨物新的，價値貴些，貨物舊的，價値强些，貨物好的，價値貴些，貨物壞的，價値賤些，酌盈濟虚，原是有道，　　自從卒亥革命以後，舊的禮敎拚命打破，而新的禮敎，並未產生，因此而將成無禮敎之國，在普通一般的心理，以爲新的意義，就是反乎舊便爲新，因此而便有非忠非孝等種種說數出來，照這樣說來，並不是重新估定一切價値，確是完全召盤，豈非可笑，故所謂重新估定一切價値者，譬如一物，從前値價三元，現在祇値一元五角，從前祗値一元五角，現在反値四元五元，這敎做重新估定一切價値，現在反舊爲新主義，明明是破產召盤，因此腦筋舊的，敝帚千金，把從前一切的一切，完全不肯放棄，而腦筋新的，拔本塞源，蔑視一切，上追原人時代，這是完全不懂重新估定一切價値的意義所致，　　諸位欲明白現在的時代麽？祗要看看現在的大廉價，文藝苦熱  知足　　烈日當天火繖張，汗珠如雨濕衣裳，終朝揮動蒲葵扇，莫遣清風竟體凉。　　凉沁心脾怕飲冰，偶嘗汽水價偏增，閒來只把甘瓜剖，却暑依然恨未能。　　絶少凉風陣陣飄，不堪酷熱逼連朝，形骸已垢頻思浴，浴罷蘭湯暑未消。　　溫度升將百度高，酣眠莫學北窗陶，笑余痴望陰雲起，願降清凉雨幾遭。科學人造橡皮的最新成功  右立　　　　橡皮用途極廣，在工業發達的美國，尤其處處用到。可是美國地方不產橡皮，所以不得不仰給於他國，漏巵甚鉅，一般美國人都想找到一種替代物，以謀挽回利權。大發明家愛迪生晩年即從事於研究製造人造橡皮，可惜尙未獲得顯著的成功而愛氏已經作古了。最近美國科學界對於人造橡皮已經試騐成功，開始使用。這種人造橡皮名稱呌做［鍚奥可］（Thiokol）。　　［鍚奥可］的成份是些很普通的化學原料。第一步，將苛性鈉（Caustic　Soda）與硫磺置桶内搗和，合成多硫化物（Polysulfid）。然後把合成的多硫化物傾入另一桶内，加入乙烯二氣化物（Etbylenedichloeid）。　　第三步，把多硫化物和乙烯二氣化物所混和而成的一種溶液注入第三只桶中，待有一種黃色粉末沉澱於桶底時，即將上面的濁水取去。如此接連換水數次，把所有雜渣盡行去除。然後加入鹽酸（Hydrochoric　Acid），那溶液便凝結成爲一種黃色膠物。最後在那膠物上加以壓力，把水份盡行擠出，而［鍚奥可］丨人造橡皮丨就吿成功。　　目下［鍚奥可］尙未達到完善的地步　　（太不平均了！）。牠有一種觸鼻難聞的氣味，所以現在尙不能用牠來製造家庭日常用品。　　此外，［鍚奥可］的緊張力（Tensilestrength）不及橡皮。橡皮的緊張力最高時達四千五百磅，目下［鍚奥可］緊張力的最高紀錄是一千三百磅左右。　　可是［鍚奥可］也有許多優點。橡皮浸於油，汽油，以及其他類似的東西中一二日，牠的緊張力減至五百磅以下。在同樣情形之下，［鍚奥可］却不受影響　　又，橡皮遇油膨脹，即不堪用。［鍚奥可］却無此病。　　［鍚奥可］在任何東西上都能黏着，橡皮却於有許多的東西上是黏着不牢的。所以［鍚奥可］的發明實爲製造家解决了一個重大的問題。改良社會討論會一般社會心理改良質范君式之  文炳　　基於一切理論的建立，須從批判做起，所以我敢於平心靜氣地來寫這篇文章。范君大文（一般社會心理改良的我見）總意是：中國的社會是惡劣的，畸形的，半封建的，不健全的，是還在舊的社會沒有完全破滅，新的社會沒有完全建設的過渡時期裏；一般人的心理是：（一）自私自利，（二）虚僞欺詐，（三）崇尙表面，（四）猜疑陰謀：務須澈底的改良這四種舊社會所遺剩的不良心理。　　這說話，在對社會無澈骨的認識的人看來似，乎很對：但一加檢討，便不免使人失望，何以故？請略加申述如后：　　中國現社會的敗　，畸形，這是無可諱言的鐵一般的事實，范君對於此點分析闡明得非常透澈，不佞肯首稱佩，然其下文却使我大失望而特失望，豈知范君意把主要的下文隨意葬送了！范君說：［……須知社會的本身是不會百孔千瘡疾病叢生以致不可收拾的，所以……還是組成這社會的每個個人所逐漸造成的，而每個個人所以要造成這種不良社會，還是由於他們的腦海裏有一種…不良心理所造成·］這就是說，社會的敗　，是由於人心不良；質言之，即是因爲中國人的心理不良，所以造成中國目前的混沌社會，范君竟如此唯心的搬出十八世紀以前的理論來解剖中國今日的社會，殊令人失敬！苟如是，那末，中國古代社會的安謐，歐美各國現社會之較中國爲好，以及蘇俄社會的繁榮，全都是良爲的心理造成的了，這可說得過去麽？須知這是因爲制度與其他環境所造成的，有中國已不適宜的現制度，而又陷入帝國主義的殖民地的環境，所以社會便一天天地糟了，所以形成范君所說的四種不良的心理，所以社會上很少有大公無私，廉潔守法，負責誠實，實事求是，互相信仰，團結一致的人了·而范君竟說：［我們欲願社會國家走上光明平坦的康莊大道，必須澈底剷除這四種舊社會所殘餘的毒物……不良心理·］這種不探究竟只下結論的說話，是何等的白費心血呵！　　本來照Dialectique（辯證法）說來，社會心理有時也能影響到社會現象，但其影響至爲微渺，更不是范君所說的那樣：中國社會之不良，竟是由於人心不良所致·故范君這次的立論，無疑義地是錯了·我常遇到許多人，尤其是老學究以及要人名流，常對社會之不良作如是說，婆心苦口地抒發宏論，結果不但所言無效，而且眼見社會日益糟了，這全是因爲運用觀察社會的方法不正確，所以不能把社會透視清楚，所以說出的話是差誤，作文的主意失敗了。　　我的結論是：誠如范君所說，中國的社會是敗壞極了，人心也敗壞極了；但這是制度與其他環境的反映，就是說：中國社會的一切缺陷，都是帝國主義與軍閥勾結演成的現象丨結果，欲想中國翻身，及滌蕩一般不良的社會心理，只有把國際帝國主義打出去，把國内的軍閥殲滅，然後再釐定適合大衆要求的制度，如此才能挽救中國社會，才能改良一般不良的社會心理·若只說要一般人的心理澈底改良。那無異如對牛彈琴，徒勞無獲·質之高明，其意云何？無生路日記中的一頁  人　　窮人的嘴巴　　在嗚嗚的放工的汽笛聲中，心身感着極度的疲乏和創痛，拖着沉重而遲緩的步調，走出了工廠。回頭望了望偉大而雄壯的建築，我便低吟一聲［你這吃人不眨眼的老虎！］　　頰上還是熱烘烘地，辣剌剌地，用手摸着，感覺微微的紅腫，想起適才那挺胸凸肚肥胖碩大的工頭粗聲暴氣下的一擊耳光丨丨啊，這一擊耳光！自出娘胎從未嘗過的！値得逗引同伴哄塲大笑！我爲着要在生活之下掙扎，只得噙着眼淚無條件地忍受下了。　　眼前是一陣陣地昏暗，心頭是不斷地爲悲哀襲擊着，在行人道上低頭前走，忽然間，一輛黃包車，車夫是個瘦弱面黃的漢子，滿臉掛着汗珠，氣喘的好像呼吸不及的樣子，然而，他仍然拖着車飛奔着。在一家石庫鐵門前，車停了，一個團面大腹的中年跳下車來，按了按門牆上的電鈴，接着［呀］聲中，門打開了半邊，當差的像一隻馴性的狗垂手立在門後，恭敬而細聲地喊着［主人回來了？］　　中年大塊頭探手在腰包中掏出一個雙毫來，直向門外車夫身上擲去：車夫看了看地上的毫子，很敏捷地毅然跨進大門，操着不純熟的江北上海話：　　［先生：外灘拉到楊樹浦，兩隻角子太少……］　　［混帪東西，忘八蛋，拖他出去，給他兩擊耳光……］大塊頭恨恨地吩咐着。］　　於是，有一種清脆的掌擊聲，好像是手心與面頰接觸而發的音從門裏傳出，同時穿着汗濕透了半邊的紅背心號衣的車夫跌出了街沿：接着，［怦］的鐵門關上了。　　車夫爬起來，拾起地面上的毫子塞進腰包裏。右手輕微地拭了拭眼淚：左手撫着熱辣的嘴巴。他默然望了望森嚴的大鐵門，細弱的從鼻腔裏呼出一絲怨氣。他重復拖着車子慢慢的走了。家　向　　义麻雀  建勳　　當張家少奶奶，從她一月來未曾整理過的牀上起身的時候，裏牀的她的丈夫早沒有了，她普不驚奇，因爲這是常例，　　她一面慢慢地梳着頭髮，一面細細地咀嚼昨晚第三十六圈末付莊的滋味，假使和下來，喝丨倒是一付清一色的平和四代二十·四十·八十·一百六·三百二·啊，一付辣子，她想到這裏，不禁有些着惱，好好的一付辣子，竟被上家罩和，不然，也可以少輸三塊錢，　　抬起頭來，望着面前的一塊鏡子，忽然發現了自已臉色底蒼白，好驚惶得什麽似的，想着她青春之消逝，蒼白的臉已非胭脂的紅所能遮蓋，蘋果色的臉龐已是隔夜的舊夢，她覺悟到［康健］［美貌］［金錢］已隨着麻雀牌聲之擘拍而付之雲烟，其餘如丈夫的埋怨，更無庸說，　　她悔恨，她懊惱，她悲哀，她又懺悔那已往的過失，她誓着［永再不义麻雀了。］忽然門外傳進了一縷尖利的音波，［少奶奶，脚都齊了，就缺你一個，怎麽這時候還不來，］　　下午四點半，張少奶奶的丈夫從公司中辦事回來，一進屋看見了房中雜亂與汚穢，縐了縐眉，他並不找他的夫人，因爲他曉得找也無益，這是常例，他毫不驚奇，　　他忽然發現了他夫人义麻雀的塲所，因爲對門李家傳過來一陣熟悉的聲音，　　［東風碰白板暗克，四·十二，三十二，六十四，一百二十八和，］生意經生意經之種種  天蛟　　（一）　　交易所裏做多頭的人心裏想：［華北局勢不致有變動，汪精衛也有復職希望，情形看來總要好幾元吧。］空頭朋友也在想：［日本爲什麽還不攻熱河呢？如果日本一出兵，公債至少要跌一板呢！］　　（二）　　實業家說：［今年如何辦法呢？貨色銷路呆滯，金融界又不肯墊欵。］　　銀行家說：［時局眞不好，放欵實在不敢做。但是存欵的要貼利息，如何是好？］　　（三）　　售劣貨的心中又着急又惱怒：［可惡的血魂除奸團，爲什麽吃了飯要管我們的事，把可以賺錢的勾當擾掉了呢？］　　售國貨的正在得意：［再繼續抵制幾個月，我們銷路一好，還可以乘機加價呢。］　　（四）　　黃包車夫辛辛苦苦地拉了一天，祗賺到幾角錢，還要一家數口的開銷，口中不住喊丨［乖不得了！］　　電影女明星祗灣灣腰，露幾露腿，倒也有汽車坐，但是也要說［勿是生意經］呢！　幕呌你入局  澍　　我素喜獨自逛馬路，尤喜在各家公司的玻璃櫉窗前兀立着觀望，固然那些陣列櫉裏的五顏六色的泊來貨物，在我有［生］的歷史以前就註定着沒有我窮措大光顧的份兒，可是，我總以爲望梅或許是可以止渴的。　　星期三放了工，爲着要節省十幾枚銅元的車資，便安步當車，沿着南京路向西走，經過永安公司櫉窗，我又非意識地循例停了脚步，張大着眼和嘴，朝櫉裏陳列着的珍貴的物品看…看…大槪是看出神了吧，充分地露出我原來的土老兒的模型，再加之這粗俗的衣裝，呌誰看了不發笑呢？　　［先生，請問那衣服沒有開襟，是怎樣著的？］在我旁邊的一位仁兄指着櫉裏的女洋裝問我：我看呆了，一時想不到有人招呼我，我倒怔了一怔。　　那是女人穿的洋裝呢，是從頭上套上的］。我向他看了一眼，他的衣裝和我差不多，倒是一個誠實的商人模樣。　　［先生府上是湖北］？他也打着湖北腔和我對白。　　［兄弟籍貫安徽：在湖北多年］。　　［在下也是安徽人。先生在那家寳號發財］？　　我們互認同鄕了。當我吿訴他我的姓名職業及現在住址後，同時我也曉得他是一位五馬路ＸＸ申莊的經理柏ＸＸ生生。最後，他吿訴我，他挾有少許資本，想幹點實業的工作，幷頗有意思要我帮他忙的樣子。當我們分别的時候，他言之再三地約我星期日到他莊裏和他談談，並助他籌劃籌劃。　　在極度的疲乏中，我到家了。我頗自得地將適才的巧遇提出來報吿他們，我幷吿訴他們，我將去拜訪這位忠誠而仁厚的同鄕。　　［你想他會找你去做經理嗎？這是騙局，你還在得意呢］！他們忠吿般地嘲笑我。　　［我這個窮光蛋，又不想去投資，難道他騙我這個人不成］？然而我極力的反辯，意思是怪他們錯欵了好人，不該以小人之心去度君子之腹。　　在那個星期日的前晩，我正準備明日去赴［同鄕］的約會，心裏奇妙地打算着如何貢獻給他一點久積胸頭的關於經營實業的意見。　　［你一個人呆想什麽？今天回來早呀］。同居的Ｘ世伯，他是一位老上海。　　［他快要做經理了，你應當恭喜他］　　他們這樣的嘲笑，當然不會引起我的覺悟。我重將事實演述了一遍，要求Ｘ世伯同情的判斷。　　［這個確是騙局，但騙局不大］！他捋了捋鬍子，笑眯眯地說，［我有個朋友的兒子，也同樣地在馬路上碰着陌不相識的人談得很投機，要找他做經理，幾次談判，就有所謂要辦實業的同志硬拖軟說地勸他入局賭博，結果輸了一百幾十塊錢，以後便再不見他的所謂同志的踪影兒了。你這次的事，我想亦不過是呌你入局賭博而已。不信，你明日去試試看］。</p>

<h3>The Chinese Civil War and the Deficiencies of Life</h3>
<p>By Zi</p>
<p>Biologists believe that the European War of 1914 was indeed the result of the development of the European mind and hands. In other words, it was caused by the deficiencies in the evolution of their lives. The Chinese domestic war of the past twenty years is obviously not due to the development of the Chinese mind and hands. However, the relationship between the outbreak of the Chinese civil war and the deficiencies in the life and evolution of the Chinese people is quite worthy of clarification.</p>
<p>Chinese governance has always regarded the tranquility of the four borders and the well-being of the people as the ultimate goal. However, the national turmoil and the people's hardship in the past twenty years, as evidenced by the facts, have mostly been stirred up by the local rulers. This is because Chinese officials, on the one hand, cannot escape the old family-centered lifestyle of buying land and houses and raising children and grandchildren, which occupies their minds every day. On the other hand, they are seduced by the material life of the West, indulging in extravagance and luxury, and cannot use the traditional virtues of thrift to assist in the fulfillment of their family-centeredness. This contradiction between the two new and old lifestyles stimulates their desires and fuels their ambitions. Thus, they all want to use their existing military force to solve the problem of their life deficiencies, and the civil war arises.</p>
<p>The Western people's enjoyment of life is complemented by the development of industry and the progress of capitalism. Therefore, their enjoyment of life does not hinder politics or military affairs in any way. China has always relied on becoming an official to seek the highest standard of living. Those with considerable knowledge and ability in the country compete with each other in the officialdom. What is the reason for this? It is simply a matter of livelihood. Since the establishment of the Republic of China, although the phrase "officials are public servants" has been written in articles, in reality, officials still mostly have the old goal of seeking the highest standard of living in order to obtain a new style of enjoyment of life. The income of officials is limited, but the needs of an enjoyable life are endless. Thus, they either feel the narrowness of their territory or regret the limitation of their power, striving to develop and conflicting with each other, and the civil war arises.</p>
<p>The relationship between civil war and life deficiencies can be explored in many ways. This is merely an explanation of the scope of the civil war that has been noted in the recent Abolish Civil War Grand Alliance Representative Congress, in order to show the fundamental problem of the civil war in the past twenty years. Now, looking at the procedures stipulated in Article 2 of the Abolish Civil War Grand Alliance's constitution: 1. Announce the evils of civil war in peacetime, which is to abolish civil war with moral force. 2. When disputes occur, advise both parties to mediate, which is to abolish civil war with emotional influence. 3. Refuse to cooperate when civil war occurs, which is to contain civil war with the power of a third party. These three methods can be applied opportunistically and may have some effect. However, if one wants to fundamentally eliminate civil war with these methods, it is feared that it will not be possible. The function of the Abolish Civil War Grand Alliance, as expressed, is to resolve internal strife in order to resist foreign insults. Its charter stipulates that the organization will be established for five years or may be dissolved early. Perhaps, in order to cope with the current urgent situation, it is necessary to set rapid and effective emergency measures. But we believe that for the sake of permanently eliminating civil war, it is more important to seek a fundamental solution through the harmonization of life evolution.</p>

<h3>Luo Wengan Refutes Uchida's Speech</h3>
<p>The Japanese Government's Ambitions are Fully Exposed</p>
<p>Blatantly Challenging the World's Correct Opinions</p>
<p>The Chinese People Have Absolutely No Anti-Foreign Thoughts</p>
<p>But are Determined Not to Abandon an Inch of Territory</p>
<p>(Nanjing) On the morning of the 29th, Foreign Minister Luo delivered a speech at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Commemorative Week, refuting the speech by Japanese Foreign Minister Uchida in the Diet and clarifying the diplomatic policies held by our government. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Foreign Minister Uchida's speech in the Japanese Diet on August 25th has fully exposed the Japanese government's ambitions, making it unnecessary for them to conceal their plans to invade China in the future. This is truly an act by the Japanese government challenging the world's correct opinions. Disregarding the calls for human peace, despising the organization of the League of Nations, and trampling on the obligations of all sacred treaties, the Japanese government has brazenly delivered a speech that declares to the world Japan's right to invade China, its right to seize and abandon provinces, its right to create puppets and call them independent countries for manipulation, and ultimately its right to annex them. Uchida's words are a retelling of ancient militarism, adorned with 20th-century language. Japan's pretext for aggression is self-defense, claiming that the right to self-defense can be exercised outside its national territory. They also argue that the Kellogg-Briand Pact does not prohibit the free exercise of the right to self-defense. Japan's hidden intention to tear up the Kellogg-Briand Pact is evident here. If this interpretation were accepted by the other sixty-one signatory nations, the Kellogg-Briand Pact would be no better than waste paper, not negating war but guaranteeing aggression. The Kellogg-Briand Pact clearly stipulates that any dispute must not be resolved by any means other than peaceful methods. Even if Japan's interests in China were indeed damaged as Japan claims, the Japanese government could have adopted the peaceful methods commonly used in international law to demand appropriate solutions from the Chinese government. However, the Japanese government did not lodge any complaints with the National Government, but suddenly bombed the Beida Camp on the night of September 18th, occupied Shenyang, ravaged our cities, and allowed the Northeast to fall. To still call this self-defense only makes the perpetrators' crimes even more serious. Recently, U.S. Secretary of State Stimson stated, "There is a country that uses the protection of its own people as a mask to conceal its imperialist policies; its mask will soon be exposed." Now, Japan has indeed exposed its own mask. The Japanese government wants to recognize the puppet organization, and is again making sophisticated arguments, saying that the establishment of the puppet state of Manchuria was out of the willingness of the Manchurian people, and is a kind of separatist movement within China, and the Nine-Power Treaty does not prohibit the separation of China, because of this Japan's recognition of this new country is also not prohibited by the Nine-Power Treaty. However, the trouble in the Eastern Provinces does not originate from separatist movements, but from external aggression. It is the Japanese warlords who have brought their puppets onto the stage, putting a monkey in official garb, and organized a puppet government, and called it the Independent State of Manchuria. It is also the Japanese warlords who are forcing their own will to be put into practice. It is also the Japanese warlords who are whipping and driving our thirty million compatriots in the Eastern Provinces, making them groan under the iron hooves of the Japanese and unable to express their free will. In fact, in terms of geography, history, and the psychology of the people, the three northeastern provinces will always be an inseparable part of Chinese territory, and the compatriots in the Eastern Provinces will always be loyal citizens of the Republic of China. Once the Japanese troops withdraw, the puppet organization will inevitably collapse. There is no doubt about this. If there is indeed a so-called separatist movement in China, it is purely a matter of internal affairs, and the Nine-Power Treaty will naturally not apply. However, today Japan is wielding its iron fist, seizing our land, setting up a puppet state single-handedly, which is a violation of the Nine-Power Treaty's provisions on respecting China's territorial and administrative integrity, without any need for discussion. Moreover, Japan's destruction of the Nine-Power Treaty was implemented on the evening of the September 18th bombing of Shenyang, and has gradually expanded since then, even to the extent of kidnapping Puyi and installing him as a puppet ruler. Now they have even openly declared that they will recognize the puppet organization. If this is implemented, Japan's crime of destroying the Nine-Power Treaty will be even greater. Foreign Minister Uchida's claim that Manchuria has embarked on a path of peace and progress is truly a self-deceptive statement. If we take a look around, we can find everywhere that the anti-Japanese movement of the people in the Eastern Provinces is increasing day by day. Under the strong firepower of Japanese artillery and aircraft bombing, the activities of the volunteer army are continuing one after another, without any slackening. As for Manchuria's industry and commerce, since the Japanese army occupied the Eastern Provinces, it has been declining day by day. The state of its decline and disorder is unprecedented. Before the complete withdrawal of the Japanese army and the restoration of the territory by the Chinese government, there is hardly any peace and prosperity to speak of in the Eastern Provinces. When Foreign Minister Uchida was defending Japan's aggression against China, he mentioned China's internal affairs and the activities of the Communist Party. We certainly do not want to boast that our administration is perfect and flawless. Our administration is indeed unable to avoid the general rise and fall, prosperity and decline, reform and change that all countries have. Our work of suppressing the Communist bandits has not yet been completely successful. We have also been unable to escape the impact of the global recession, and the unprecedented floods of last year caused great damage, and there is still lingering pain. Under these circumstances, we believe that our eastern neighbor, Japan, should also be a people of another country, giving us the greatest sympathy, and at least giving moral assistance to our difficult post-disaster work. However, Japan has taken advantage of the opportunity to take advantage of people's dangers and implement its predetermined military aggression against China, setting a precedent in modern history. This is indeed beyond our expectations. Now Japan has shown utmost contempt for the whole world, for the League of Nations, for the Kellogg-Briand Pact, the Nine-Power Treaty, and other international conventions and the public opinion of mankind. The Japanese are vainly trying to complete their aggression rapidly before the world pronounces judgment, creating a [fait accompli] to fulfill their dream of military conquest. However, enlightened countries have long stated in advance that they will not recognize situations created by violence. I would like to take this opportunity to state the main points of the Chinese government's policy on the current situation as follows: (1) The Chinese government and people have absolutely no anti-foreign thoughts, but under the current situation created by Japanese military aggression, it is absolutely impossible for the Chinese people to express the most cordial friendship to the Japanese people. Improving and restoring the relationship between the Chinese and Japanese people is up to Japan to do. (2) China will absolutely not give up an inch of territory or any part of its sovereignty because of military oppression, and at the same time, it is determined to resist military aggression with all its might. (3) China absolutely cannot agree to any solution to the Northeast issue that takes the puppet organization in the Eastern Provinces, created, maintained, and controlled by Japanese military force, as a prerequisite. (4) China firmly believes that a reasonable solution to the Northeast issue in the future must meet the necessary conditions of not violating the text and spirit of the League of Nations Covenant, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Nine-Power Treaty, as well as China's sovereignty, while also being able to consolidate permanent peace in the Far East.

<h3>Yanqing Pillaged, Losses Extremely Heavy</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Xuanhua report: Liu Guitang's bandit troops left Yanqing County on the night of the 27th and fled to Gucheng.

<p>Communist Riot in Qingzhou</p>
<h3>Plot Exposed, Twenty-Seven People Arrested</h3>
<p>(Jinan) The Qingzhou Communist Party's plan to riot after the autumn harvest was detected by the county government and the provincial party department.

<h3>Ma Ze Zhao Talks About the Kang-Tibetan Dispute</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Ma Ze Zhao, the representative of Xikang stationed in Beijing, said that the Kang-Tibetan issue could be resolved peacefully, which is what the people hope for. But in fact, the Dalai Lama may not be able to comply. Previously, according to the case drafted by Yi Tang Ke San and Tibetan merchants, we even said that they ceded land and succumbed, and were deeply dissatisfied. However, the Dalai Lama was still unwilling to fulfill it. Recently, our side has taken back about one-third of the land forcibly occupied by the other side, and they have suffered even greater losses. It is difficult for the Dalai Lama to end the matter on this basis. In terms of military strength, there are 20,000 Tibetan soldiers in the front. Although our Sichuan army has hundreds of thousands, only three brigades have been dispatched. The climate is mild and they are still able to resist. In the future, the Tibetan soldiers will be resistant to the cold and have leather clothing for protection. Our army is definitely not their match. After the Jinsha River freezes, the Tibetan soldiers will be able to cross the river without boats. It is now appropriate to take advantage of the opportunity to occupy Ping Qiang Du in order to defend it. Otherwise, we are still afraid of withdrawing from Dege. We hope that the central government will decide on a policy as soon as possible and provide full assistance. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Bleak Clouds Loom Over the Future of Japanese Politics</h3>
<p>The Seiyukai's Attitude Suddenly Turns Harsh</p>
<p>Refusal to Compromise with the Government on Rescue Measures</p>
<p>Prime Minister Saito Finds it Difficult to Please Everyone</p>
<p>Navy Minister Okada Runs Around Attempting to Mediate</p>
<p>Emergency Parliament Decides to Extend Session by Three Days</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 29th - Prime Minister Saito is striving to break the deadlock regarding the debt restructuring plan and the Rice Law amendment, but the Seiyukai is maintaining a firm stance, saying there is no room for compromise. Within the cabinet, members from the Seiyukai, such as Finance Minister Takahashi and Railway Minister Mitsuchi, are firmly opposed to the debt restructuring plan, while Agriculture Minister Goto is adhering to his own views regarding the Rice Law amendment, threatening to resign. The government absolutely opposes both plans, putting it in a very difficult situation. As a result, the government may make mutual concessions with the Seiyukai and persuade Agriculture Minister Goto to yield, in an attempt to find a compromise and turn the situation around. However, this will depend on Prime Minister Saito's actions. Conflict is unavoidable, and the situation is quite serious.</p>
<p>▲ China United Press, Tokyo, 29th - The Japanese political situation is at a standstill due to the Seiyukai's proposal of the Rice Law amendment, the Debt Restructuring Association Law, and the Central Bank Law, which conflict with the government's proposals. Initially, it was reported that the Seiyukai leaders had compromised with the government, causing unrest among the radicals within the Seiyukai. Today, a joint meeting was held in the afternoon to discuss countermeasures, and it was decided that no concessions would be made on the above three proposals. The meeting adjourned at 10:30 PM. Meanwhile, the Minseito party also held an emergency meeting within the Diet, resolving to oppose the Seiyukai's three proposals and fully support Agriculture Minister Goto, without proposing alternative bills. The government, due to Agriculture Minister Goto's insistence on opposing the Seiyukai's proposals, also decided within the cabinet to support Goto. With such a stalemate, conflict is unavoidable. Saito dispatched Navy Minister Okada to meet with Budget Committee Chairman Okada, entrusting him with the task of easing the opposition. Later, he consulted with Mori Kaku, and Railway Minister Mitsuchi also visited Mochizuki Keisuke to smooth things over with the opposition within the Seiyukai. However, the outcome is not yet optimistic.</p>
<p>▲ China United Press, Tokyo, 29th - The Japanese emergency parliament has decided to extend its session by three days, scheduled to end on September 2nd. If the issues cannot be resolved by then, it will be extended again to the 4th. The Minseito, Seiyukai, and Kokumin Domei parties have all expressed criticism, saying that if the government continues in this manner, even extending the session by ten days will be futile. The Seiyukai, in particular, held a meeting of its executives, urging the government to immediately accept the Rice Law amendment, debt restructuring, and Central Bank Law proposed by the party. Otherwise, they are prepared to initiate a vote of no confidence. The Japanese political situation is becoming increasingly serious.</p>
<h3>Air Combat Exercises in Tokyo on the 1st of Next Month</h3>

<h3>Wu Teng Narrowly Escapes Assassination Twice Before Going to the Northeast</h3>
<p>▲ According to the Osaka Asahi Shimbun, at 3:35 PM on the 21st, when Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary Wu Teng was at Kyoto Station before his departure, there was a large crowd seeing him off. Police officers and military police were on high alert. Unexpectedly, a suspicious-looking man was discovered in the third-class waiting room. Upon searching him, officers from the Shichijo police station found a six-shot pistol in his possession, intending to harm Wu Teng. The man, named Kintaro Kitamura, resided in Konyacho, Kanda Ward, Tokyo. Fortunately, he was arrested on the spot, and disaster was averted. Also, on the 23rd, when Wu Teng left Kyoto heading west on passenger car No. 101, an obstruction suddenly occurred as the train passed east of Todō Station in Tsuno County, Yamaguchi Prefecture. The driver braked sharply and saw a large granite boulder of over a foot in size placed across the tracks and guard rails, narrowly avoiding a derailment. The Tokuyama police station considered the matter serious and launched a rigorous search for the perpetrator.</p>
<h3>Papen Criticizes the Nazi Party</h3>
<p>Resolves to Suppress Political Violence with Force</p>
<p>His Rash Actions Disqualify Him from Holding Political Power</p>
<p>Also Explains Economic Reform Plan</p>
<p>Issuing Tax Credit Certificates to Open Up New Sources of Revenue</p>
<p>Incentivizing Private Enterprises to Reduce Unemployment</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Berlin, 29th - In a radio address yesterday, Prime Minister Papen, after criticizing the National Socialist Party, stated that Germany cannot abandon its global economic relations and adopt autarky. The cabinet also supports autonomy, but only to the extent of providing essential food supplies. Therefore, the cabinet will continue to implement moderate import management methods. As for the monetary system, it must not be endangered, the mark must not be devalued, and private businesses must not be interfered with. Germany's recovery plan involves expanding public works and restoring private enterprises to absorb the unemployed. 130 million marks can be allocated for public works, and 2 billion marks can be risked to boost industry. The National Bank has already agreed to this. Taxes that hinder production, such as transaction taxes, estimated to amount to 1.3 billion marks next year, will be returned to economic life in the form of certificates. Taxpayers can use these to borrow an equivalent amount from the National Bank. The government also plans to loan 700 million marks to businesses that increase employment. Wages can be reduced to a minimum, and official salaries must also be reduced. This plan has been decided to be implemented for one year. Papen's final remarks indicated that he has no intention of resigning. He said, "I believe it is my responsibility to resist all improper interference from party forces. The next few months will be devoted to settling matters. The rash behavior of Nazi leader Hitler following the Büssen murder trial shows that he is not qualified to be a government leader. As for the current cabinet, it will crack down on the activities of the National Socialist Party. If necessary, I will use force to extinguish the fires of civil war and eliminate political violence."</p>
<p>▲ Nationalist News Agency, Berlin, 29th - German Chancellor Papen stated in a speech at the Westphalia Farmers' Congress today: (1) The government hopes to provide jobs for 1.75 million unemployed people through its economic reform plan; (2) The current government will never disregard the fundamental principles of the Weimar Constitution; (3) He and his cabinet members will never allow any party to seize political power by depriving others of their rights. Regarding the economic reform portion, Papen strongly emphasized the importance of the domestic market, arguing that progress in the domestic market is a prerequisite for improving the national economic life. However, it is also important not to endanger export trade. The government has never considered interfering in private enterprises because it wants to build new confidence in the future of the German economy and must re-stimulate the spirit of private enterprise. The government's unemployment reduction plan aims to incentivize private businesses to increase their employment. One of the biggest obstacles at present is that many factories have neglected factory repairs and renovations in recent years due to a lack of capital. To provide the necessary capital, the government will work closely with the Deutsche Bank to issue tax credit certificates, based on transaction taxes, transportation taxes, and land taxes, etc., which are due in October 1933. In the future, these certificates can be used to pay a portion of taxes, but income tax cannot be paid with these certificates. The issuance will be discounted, and is thus effectively a loan. The government hopes to raise 1.5 billion marks through this, of which 700 million marks will be used to incentivize the hiring of new employees. The plan is to subsidize employers with 400 marks in tax credit certificates for each new employee hired each year. If these 700 million marks can be fully utilized, they should be able to provide jobs for 1.75 million unemployed people. Further details regarding the government's plan will be announced when the government outlines its policy direction to the new parliament. He wants to solemnly declare that the government will never disregard the fundamental principles of the Weimar Constitution, nor will it ever consider changing the republican government.</p>

<h3>Second Day of the Anti-Imperialist War Conference</h3>
<p>▲ Havas, The Hague, 29th - The Anti-Imperialist War Conference continued today. The Danish representative said that fascism is emerging in various countries and expressed resistance.

Barbusse from France, Gaussen, Padke from India, and Kaaiana (transliteration) from Japan were all elected as members. Bagamon protested against French imperialism. The French representative Gaussen believes that if you want to oppose imperialist war, you must establish an international united front. Relying solely on meetings and discussions will not achieve true peace. Gaussen also said that imperialism is full of talk about peace, but in reality, it is secretly preparing for war. At that time, several Japanese representatives opposed the imperialism of their own country. Gaussen specifically paid tribute to them. The work of the conference continued yesterday.</p>
<h3>Number of Russian Red Guards Increases</h3>

<p>▲ Nationalist News Agency, Moscow, 28th - New recruits will join the Red Guards on September 1st, all strong men born in 1910, reaching the age of military service, and conscripted for training.

As for the officers, in the past year alone, 300 field officers and captains joined the party, as well as more than 20,000 non-commissioned officers. All recruits are thoroughly reviewed, and only those whose political views and other qualifications are not contrary to the party are allowed to join. Among the worker and peasant classes, only those who strictly adhere to communism are entrusted with the important task of defending the country.</p>
<h3>Imprisonment of a Spanish Rebel General</h3>
<p>Where is the Spirit of His Former Heroism?</p>
<p>▲ Havas, Santoña, Spain, 28th - The Dueyasso penal colony is where General Sanjurjo is being held to atone for his crimes. The penal colony is located in the province of Santoña. The prison building is isolated from the outside world, with over a hundred guards armed with guns standing guard outside. To reach the prison, journalists must pass through several high stone walls and undergo layers of interrogation before reaching the courtyard of the prison. Finally, they arrive at room number 52, where Sanjurjo is detained. The furnishings of the cell are simple, consisting of a cabinet, a table, a chair, and an iron bed. Sanjurjo has received special treatment from the authorities, so the iron bed is covered with a wool mattress. The small cabinet contains the clothes that Sanjurjo wore during his battles in Morocco, recalling the time when Sanjurjo wore these clothes, full of spirit and unrivaled. Now, however, he guards this iron window for the rest of his days. The room has a small window facing the sea, with the sea crashing against the jagged rocks below. Sanjurjo wears a gray prison uniform with yellow markings. There is a vase of flowers and several books on the table. The general seems to be quite healthy. When someone talks about his new life, the general replies, "[I hope to get used to it soon and put all the worries behind me. Although I am currently ill, the only thing that occupies my mind is my family.]" It is said that when Sanjurjo first arrived, the prisoners here were greatly stimulated, because Sanjurjo used to come to inspect them when he was the commander of the security forces.</p>
<h3>Lion Enters City, No One Injured</h3>
<p>▲ Fixed Nationalist News Agency, Warsaw, 28th - A lioness was discovered today in the city of Kielce, Poland, in the middle of a busy street. Pedestrians who suddenly saw the lioness frantically ran to avoid it, but the lioness, as if it knew the way, slowly walked towards the park, without looking around or disturbing anyone. After entering the park, it slowly lay down on the grass, relaxed and at ease. Later, after gathering many police officers and soldiers armed with weapons to surround it, a lion tamer entered and led the lioness into a cage, which was transported back to the circus. It turned out that the lioness was a trained lion from a certain circus and had accidentally escaped, causing the scare.</p>
<h3>Public Telegram</h3>
<p>Telegram from Qinhuangdao - To the Shen Bao and all compatriots across the country, Japan's imperialist occupation of the Northeast has been going on for a year. They already view the Northeast as conquered territory seized by force, acting arbitrarily and recklessly. The establishment of the so-called "Manchukuo" is nothing more than possessing an empty name, willing to be its puppet. The compatriots in the Northeast have been reduced to slaves, a tragic state of subjugation that is difficult to tolerate. Dawei and others are leading tens of thousands of brave soldiers, starting today, to attack Shenyang, Liaoyang, Haicheng, Dashiqiao, and Fushun, Kaiyuan, Xinmin, and other places, uniting with all the righteous armies, taking advantage of the momentum to recover the lost territory in the Northeast. We fear that ammunition and supplies will be insufficient and difficult to sustain. We earnestly request the government to mobilize so that we can continue to resist to the end. The survival of the nation depends entirely on this. We vow to avenge our grievances to heaven and earth. We respectfully request that you provide as much material assistance as possible to encourage the soldiers. The telegram is urgent, and we are extremely hopeful. Respectfully reported, Wang Dawei, Chairman of the Northeast People's Anti-Japanese and Punitive Army Military Committee, Sheng Yu, Commander-in-Chief of the Shenyang General Command of the Northeast People's Anti-Japanese and Punitive Army, Zhao Yiliang, Commander of the Fushun Front Army, Li Juchuan, Commander of the Liaoyang Front Army, Li Jingchen, Commander of the Haicheng Front Army, Gu Yuanmin, Commander of the Yingkou Front Army, Ding Hanwu, Commander of the Tieling Front Army, Cheng Xingwu, Commander of the Kaiyuan Front Army, Yang Shoushan, Commander of the Andong Front Army, Yuan Baoshan, Commander of the Xinmin Front Army, Zhang Liangyuan, Commander of the First Army Directly Under the Shenyang Forward Command, Dong Shichen, Acting Commander of the Second Army Directly Under the Shenyang General Command, leading all the soldiers, respectfully beg.</p>
<p>Telegram from Nanjing - To all newspapers, In yesterday's report, the Chairman of the Railway Department made a speech at a reception for people from all walks of life, stating that the Ministry of Communications and military authorities had general transport regulations as early as the tenth year of the Republic. It is thought that the reporter at the time made a mistake in the record. After investigation, the report originally stated that the Ministry of Communications of the tenth year of the Republic before that was responsible for the general transport regulations, which were officially announced and on record. There was no mention of the military authorities. Special telegram for investigation and correction. Yan Yin, Business Department, Ministry of Railways.</p>

<h3>Conditions of Self-Defense Army's Anti-Japanese Resistance Under Feng</h3>
<p>Talks from a Returned Guest from Jilin</p>
<p>A communication from Beiping states that a person who recently came from Jilin spoke in great detail about the recent anti-Japanese conditions of the Self-Defense Army under Feng Zhanhai. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Pseudo-Army Uprising After the battle of Fangzheng, the Liu Baolin Brigade of the pseudo-army was disarmed. It has now been reorganized as the Pseudo-First Mixed Brigade, with Liu still serving as the brigade commander, stationed at Tiandesheng in Shulan. Feng Zhanhai sent a trusted confidant to Liu's defense area to meet with battalion commanders Jiang and Du, explaining to them the great righteousness. Jiang and Du had long intended to revolt, so they contacted the artillery and machine gun companies and others, and on August 2nd, they led more than 1,700 officers and soldiers, carrying 6 machine guns, 4 field guns, and 200,000 rounds of ammunition, and more than 1,000 rounds of artillery shells, to jointly revolt and join Feng Zhanhai. As a result, pseudo-brigade commander Liu Baolin was imprisoned by the Japanese army.</p>
<p>▲ Contacting Righteous Armies At the end of July, the righteous army under Yang Yaogao led 10,000 troops to occupy Zhuhe and continued to advance. On August 9th, they occupied Acheng County. Feng Zhanhai immediately sent the Gong and Yao brigades to advance towards the suburbs of Harbin to make contact with Yang. At the same time, they destroyed the East Road, and traffic between Harbin and Hulan is now cut off.</p>
<p>▲ Attacking Jilin The Wang Delin army has been appearing and disappearing along the Jilin-Dunhua line for a long time, making great contributions to containing the enemy army. Due to a lack of ammunition and supplies, they were unable to engage in a frontal conflict with the Japanese army. Feng Zhanhai recently sent the Tian Brigade and two other detachments and assisted Wang Delin with ammunition and supplies, seeking opportunities to attack Jilin City.</p>
<p>▲ Large-Scale Counter-Offensive Harbin, Wuchang, Shulan, Yushu, and Shuangcheng counties in northern Manchuria have become swamps due to continuous rain. The actions of the Self-Defense Army have been quite difficult, resulting in little development recently. Now that the water level is gradually receding, Feng's troops are actively preparing for a large-scale counter-offensive. A fierce battle will occur soon. (27th)</p>
<h3>Shen Honglie's Plan to Expand Naval Factory</h3>
<p>Decision to Build a Ship Dock</p>
<p>Presumed Taiping Bay as Dock Site</p>
<p>A communication from Qingdao states that the Northeast Naval Repair Factory was established in Qingdao in the 17th year of the Republic of China. Previously, when the ships belonging to the Northeast Navy were damaged or had mechanical problems, they were mostly repaired by foreign factories, which arbitrarily charged exorbitant prices. The repair costs over the years have been very high. Moreover, all countries in the world that have naval bases have considerable facilities, and repair factories are particularly urgent. Once something happens, we cannot rely on foreigners. Shen Honglie, commander of the Northeast Navy, had this in mind, and thus the naval factory was established. It has been operating for four years, achieving today's results. The evolution of the factory and future construction plans are briefly recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ Factory Evolution In the summer of the 17th year of the Republic, Shen ordered Gao Fenghua, the chief engineer of the Naval Headquarters, to be responsible for establishing the factory and concurrently appointed him as the factory director. He allocated an initial operating fund of 22,000 yuan and purchased old factory machinery from the Japanese Toyosaki Company. He straightened and repaired the original factory site several times before things were on track. The internal organization of the factory consisted of one factory director and two assistant personnel. In order to save expenses, they held concurrent positions and did not receive additional salaries. There were also chief supervisors, technicians, clerks, warehouse managers, and eight foremen, and 32 workers. The monthly salary of the employees amounted to 2,010 yuan, which was paid by the Naval Headquarters. In the 19th year, the budget was increased, with the addition of one foreman to a total of nine, and the workers increased to 56, with the monthly salary amounting to 3,643.5 yuan. In December of the 20th year, a full-time factory director was appointed to take sole responsibility. In February of the 21st year, additional personnel such as technicians and clerks were added, and the budget was increased to 3,957.5 yuan. This is the general overview of the establishment of the factory. Although the shipyard had not yet been built due to funding issues, the various warships could repair all but the underwater parts themselves. The expenses saved in the past three years were considerable. As for the repair project, the budget was first estimated and submitted to the department for approval. After completion, the actual labor and materials used were calculated based on the final calculation, and the repair costs were received. The required cost was very different from that of other factories. Later, as the project increased, the factory site was insufficient for application. After repeated negotiations between the Naval Headquarters and the Qingdao authorities, it was moved to the current factory site in May of the 18th year of the Republic of China (i.e., the old site of the former German torpedo factory). This place has a wide ground, the scale is rough, and it is close to the sea, allowing warships to be parked at the factory dock at any time for construction and repair, which is very convenient for transportation and economical. At the time, Commander Shen believed that the army's radio station was still lacking, so in the 18th year, an electrical engineer was added to the factory's organization to establish a radio factory. In the 19th year, two electrical technicians were added to specialize in long-wave and short-wave radio work. Before long, the Northeast ships and organizations, such as Qingdao, Lushun, Changshan Island, Harbin, Weihaiwei, etc., all installed radio stations. The larger ones can directly connect to Europe and the United States, and the Qingdao central government and various organizations have also requested to be established on their behalf. The Boshan Coal Mining Company also purchased two units, and the</p>

<h3>Continued Important News</h3>
<p>Jiaoji Railway Sifang Park purchased a radio, which was relatively cheap and of good quality, with remarkable results. Later, because the radio factory expanded its organization, it was ordered to be renamed the Naval Radio Station in February of the 21st year. In addition to repairing warships, the factory also engaged in external business. In total, the repair costs of the completed warships were approximately 75,000 yuan in the 18th year, approximately 90,000 yuan in the 19th year, and approximately 130,000 yuan in the 20th year. The repair costs of the completed projects under the Yingzi banner were approximately 1,200 yuan in the 18th year, approximately 3,600 yuan in the 19th year, and approximately 8,000 yuan in the 20th year. Because the project was getting more and more complicated, the number of quota workers was increasingly insufficient. Depending on the situation, dozens to hundreds of temporary workers were hired to supplement the work. As for the purchase of factory assets, in addition to the old factory machinery purchased from the Fongsheng Company, air compressors, slotting machines, washing machines, lathes, gun beds, sawing machines, and many other machines were added, and a timber warehouse, staff dormitory, and blueprint room were built. All the above expenses were allocated as much as possible from the surplus of repair costs, so that such results could be achieved.</p>
<p>▲ Expansion Plan Commander Shen regretted that although the scale of the naval factory was roughly established, the shipyard had not yet been added. Therefore, it was recently decided to build a shipyard, and factory director Gao has been ordered to plan everything. Taiping Bay at the front of the factory has been designated as the dock site. As for the funding for this project, it has been decided to invite merchants to fill the bay outside the dock site. Once completed, it will be put up for lease, and the rental income will be used as construction funds. The Zhengji Shipping Company and major merchants in the city are willing to invest together to achieve this goal. In the future, this matter will not be difficult to realize. After the completion of the dock, not only can ships be repaired, but also new ships can be built. Strengthening national defense, promoting navigation, and prospering the city of Qingdao all depend on this. According to the factory's planned plan, after the dock is completed, it is planned to add a large-scale sand casting factory, a boiler factory, a machine sawmill, a shipbuilding model factory, and a new slipway. The above plans are scheduled to be completed in three years. (August 26)</p>
<h3>Fuzhou's Imports of Japanese Goods Surge</h3>
<p>Value Exceeds Two Million</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: In Fuzhou, the import of Japanese goods has recently increased significantly. Each time Japanese ships arrive from Taiwan, they are fully loaded with Japanese goods. According to reports from the Min Customs, Japanese goods imported in June and July totaled 10,342 items, weighing 4,054.5 tons, with a value of more than two million yuan. The details and quantities of Japanese goods are listed as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Japanese goods imported in June: (1) Coal: 1,300 tons; (2) Cement: 2,200 bags; (3) Bananas: 1,331 baskets; (4) Seafood: 764 items; (5) Piece goods: 323 items; (6) Sundries (including glass, electrical appliances, enamelware, porcelain, medicine, medical equipment, ironware, rice mills, scientific instruments, generators, Ajinomoto, and various goods from Jiangsu and Guangdong): 385 items; (7) Alcohol: 600 jars. The above totals 5,603 items, weighing 1,915.13 tons.</p>
<p>(B) Japanese goods imported in July: (1) Coal: 1,590 tons; (2) Cement: 1,200 bags; (3) Bananas: 937 baskets; (4) Seafood: 1,197 items; (5) Piece goods: 258 items; (6) Sundries: 221 items; (7) Alcohol: 600 jars; (8) Motor oil: 300 cans; (9) Saccharin: 26 items.</p>
<p>In terms of quantity, June saw 864 more items imported than July. In terms of tonnage, July saw 224 more tons imported than June. As for the sales market, a portion is sold locally, while the rest is shipped to various counties in northern Fujian. Since the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Associations in various circles were disbanded by the provincial government in January of this year, the boycott movement has been neglected, allowing unscrupulous merchants to do as they please.

<h3>Records of a Journey West</h3>
<p>(10) (1)</p>
<p>Remembering the Song Kilns</p>
<p>After our inspection of the coal mines at the foot of Bai Gong Temple, we took the opportunity to visit the porcelain kilns built during the Song Dynasty. The kilns are located in Chenlu Town, thirty li southeast of Tongguan County. The porcelain produced is as crude as before, with no progress whatsoever. Fortunately, the inconvenient transportation provides some protection; otherwise, they would inevitably be eliminated by natural selection. The clay is extracted from the foothills. After digging holes to extract the clay, the porcelain workers place the mud in a small pool approximately twenty-two feet in diameter. Ox carts are used to drag it around, causing the mud and soil to mix. After some time, the mud settles to the bottom, and the water is released. The mud is then taken from the pool and dragged by mules and horses to the top of the mountain, where it is placed next to the kilns. At this time, there are three workers: one kneading the clay, one forming clay blanks from the kneaded clay, and one making various vessels from the clay blanks, which are then placed in the kiln for firing. There are three types of kilns: large kilns with a length, width, and height of sixteen feet each; medium kilns with a length, width, and height of fourteen feet each; and small kilns with a length, width, and height of four feet each. The kilns produce two types of products: bowls and jars. In terms of bowls, each firing of a small kiln can produce 20,000, a medium kiln 30,000, and a large kiln 40,000. In terms of jars, a large kiln can produce 140 jars, 160 urns, and 80 chuan yu (earthen buckets, etc.). Medium and small kilns do not fire jars. Each worker can make 400 bowls per day. Each kiln requires one type of vessel. Taking three workers as the standard, it takes four months to complete. Loading the clay blanks into the kiln takes about six days, firing takes four days. After firing, it takes about seven or eight days to remove the goods from the kiln in winter, and about eleven or twelve days in summer. Each firing requires 200 baskets of coal for a large kiln, 110 to 120 baskets for a medium kiln, and over 70 baskets for a small kiln. The distribution of compensation is as follows: the two workers who make the clay blanks receive approximately 40% to 50% each, and the remainder goes to the others. For example, if a firing earns 110 yuan, the clay blank makers receive 40 yuan, the clay kneader receives 30 yuan, and the remainder receives 20 yuan each. In total, each kiln can be fired twelve times a year, earning between 240 yuan and 300 yuan each time. The unfired and crude bowls sell for three yuan per hundred, while the fired bowls sell for eight yuan per hundred. Small, unfired four-inch bowls sell for nine jiao per hundred, and two-inch bowls sell for one jiao and five fen per hundred. The glaze used is either white or black. The white glaze comes from Tangjiapu in Fuping County and costs about 1.40 yuan per hundred jin. Each kiln uses 120 jin of glaze per year. The black glaze is local loess.</p>
<p>The kiln area has about three or four hundred households. There are one hundred and twenty to one hundred and thirty kiln caves. The kilns were all built during the Song Dynasty, with seven large kilns, thirty medium kilns, and six or seven small kilns. Each kiln is made of an average of more than 14,000 bricks.</p>
<p>A Brief Account of Tongguan</p>
<p>Tongguan is a small county. The city walls are less than two li in circumference, and it is surrounded by mountains on all sides. Most of the residents live in mountain caves. The area is seventy li from west to east and one hundred and five li from north to south. The population is about five thousand households, or about forty-three thousand people. Their lifestyle is extremely simple. Each person's living expenses are about four or five yuan, which is sufficient. The county government organization only has bureaus for construction, public safety, and finance. There are over one hundred members of the militia and twenty policemen for protection. The sales of foreign goods are almost zero. The entire city only uses fifty boxes of foreign oil per year. There are about thirty shops in the city, each with a capital of no more than three or four hundred yuan.</p>
<p>In terms of education, there is one county normal school, with seventeen students. It only offers one subject, education. Graduation takes two years, and tuition is free. There are two higher primary schools, one inside the city and one in Chenlu Town outside the city. The one inside the city has over one hundred and eighty students and eight teachers. The teachers' salaries are 240 yuan per year, and the principal's is 288 yuan. The one outside the city has fifty-five students and three teachers, with the same salaries. In addition, there are eighty-one elementary schools, with a total of one thousand two hundred and forty students and eighty-one teachers. Their salaries range from 80 yuan to 100 yuan per year. There is one girls' primary school, with thirty-eight students and one principal and one teacher. The principal's salary is 180 yuan per year, and the teacher's is 160 yuan. The education funds are allocated by the Education Fund Custody Office, totaling about eleven thousand and forty yuan per year, including 500 yuan for the normal school and 3,700 yuan for the higher primary schools. The expenses for the elementary schools are borne by the local area. The teachers are all from Shaanxi Province. The curriculum, except for English in the higher primary school, is temporarily based on the primary school curriculum.</p>
<p>Staying Another Day</p>
<p>According to the inspection schedule, we were originally scheduled to depart for Yijun on the morning of the 20th. However, group leader Mr. Hu decided to stay in Tongguan for another day due to the rich mineral resources of Tongguan, in order to inspect other coal mines and not fail the main mission of this trip. However, being here is like being in an area from ancient times. All material backwardness and physical labor are bearable, but the obstructed roads and lack of communication make it impossible to know even the general outline of any earth-shattering events that may be happening in the country. Looking south, I cannot help but feel a long and thoughtful sigh. (Posted from Tongguan on the morning of the 20th)</p>

<p>Continuing News of the Dangerous Seawall Project: The Jinshanzui coastal seawall, during the hurricane on the 23rd of this month, started from the northeast and rotated southwest. The wind was very strong, and the tide rose sharply, exceeding the height of the seawall. The newly built earth and stone works of the second and fourth sections of the west seawall were mostly destroyed, and the cement works of the third section were also severely damaged. The old works from the first to the ninth sections, the old piles and wooden posts in each section, were also mostly broken. Days of gales and rain have not stopped yet. The seawall patrol office has summoned the seawall chiefs of each section to guard the seawall day and night and prepare for emergency repairs to prevent accidents. According to reports, this wind and tide is no less than the great wind of August 25th last year. If repairs are not rushed, it will be very dangerous.</p>
<p>The Protagonist of the Jealousy and Murder Case Dies: Jealousy Murder Case in the Middle of the Road: The murderer, Hu Haixun, and the victim, Zhang Aibao, were seriously injured and sent to the county hospital for treatment. Upon hearing the news, the victim Zhang Aibao's family came to Songjiang to care for her in the hospital. Her injuries deteriorated day by day, and she died in the hospital on the 29th. Her husband was very saddened. The murderer's self-inflicted wounds, although not life-threatening, will probably not heal in a short period of time.</p>

<p>Xiangxiang Refugees Disturbing the Area: A large number of refugees from Xiangxiang County, Hunan Province, entered the county from Baoshan County on the 28th, passing through Shi Xiang Gong Temple, disturbing the villages. Gao Baozhen, the county police captain, quickly sent a team to suppress them and prevent them from entering the city. They stayed overnight at Xinjing Bridge. The Public Security Bureau provided each person with one sheng of white rice. According to the leader Yang Songhua, there were a total of 378 people. They had encountered a flood and were given passports by the local county government to beg for food everywhere. On the 29th, they were escorted by the police team through Xuhang and Lou Tang and out of the county.</p>
<p>Blood Soul Anti-Treason Group Warns Unscrupulous Merchants: The County Chamber of Commerce has repeatedly received warning letters from the Shanghai Iron Blood Anti-Treason Group, the China Blood Soul Anti-Treason Group Jiading Branch, and the Blood Soul Anti-Treason Group, etc., stating that shops such as Cao Daquan, Rui Da in the city, Zhou Daheng in Lou Tang, and Zhen Tai have forgotten the wounds of the Japanese army's trampling and are doing business by selling Japanese goods, which is tantamount to colluding to destroy our China. They are ordered to immediately investigate and seal up all Japanese goods in each shop and declare them in the newspapers; otherwise, ammunition is merciless, and there will be corresponding measures to deal with them. The County Chamber of Commerce has specifically reprinted the original letter and notified all shops to quickly inspect themselves. If there are enemy goods, how should they be disposed of to show their determination to sever ties, and not to delay, lest they regret it later?</p>

<p>Good Autumn Silkworms, Silk Mills Resuming Operations: The silk market has been in a dismal state for years, reaching its lowest point. Recently, in the past two months, the European and American markets have begun to show some activity, and the price of silk cocoons has gradually increased. This year, the autumn silkworms in the four townships of this county are also in excellent condition. The early batches have mostly entered the fourth sleep and begun to eat leaves, and the earliest ones have already begun to spin their cocoons. The late batches are still in the second or third sleep, but the weather has been warm recently, so the silkworms are growing very quickly. A bumper harvest is expected. The silk mills in the city have resumed operations one after another. Large-scale mills outside the South Gate, such as Minfeng Zhenyi, are also preparing to resume operations. Yisheng Silk Mill has scheduled to resume operations on the 4th of next month. This year, the silk cocoon market is taking a tight policy. Last autumn, the rush to buy cocoons led to the bankruptcy of the industry. It is now reported that Zhu Jing'an, the manager of Minfeng Silk Mill, plans to set up fifteen cocoon shops this year, which will open around the 10th of next month, with a price limit of 50 yuan per dan.</p>

<p>Murder and Corpse Removal Case to Undergo Bone Steaming Examination: Jiang Tianzhen, the stepson of Jiang Jufa of Jiangjiatou, Baitaxiang, Fifth District, Wujin County, was murdered by his wife and others. The body was moved to destroy the evidence, and bribes were given to drop the case. After being reported, the procuratorate of the county court has filed a lawsuit according to law. Subsequently, the Henglin Public Security Sixth Sub-bureau arrested the murderer, the deceased's brother, Jiang Fada. Later, Jiangyin also arrested the deceased's mother, Jiang Huangshi, and the original reporter, Xue Aoda, and brought them to the Wujin Procuratorate for interrogation and detention. The Jiangyin County Government had sent personnel to the village to examine the body once. The Wujin County Court had requested the files for review and found them unreliable. Chief Prosecutor Yang decided to conduct another examination and decided that the body may have already decomposed and that the coffin must be opened and the bones steamed for examination. He then discussed this with the Jiangyin County Government and scheduled the bone steaming examination for September 3rd.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>The Water Police District Headquarters Will Be Moved to the Coast: The relocation of the Fourth District Headquarters of the Provincial Water Police from Wusong to Nantong has been quite inconvenient. The district chief has now been replaced by Zhang Xianyi. Zhang has decided to move the district headquarters to a suitable coastal location in the southeast and is sending surveyors to investigate. The district's detective team, on the night of the 27th, was transferring guns and was detained by the county police team for not having a passport, resulting in a misunderstanding. Martial law was declared that night, but fortunately, no other incidents occurred.</p>
<p>Silk and Cloth and General Goods Industry Opposes Receiving Business Licenses: The Nantong Tooth Tax Bureau has announced that the silk and cloth and general goods industries must comply with orders to obtain business licenses. The industries argue that they are all self-funded and engaged in sales, which cannot be compared with companies that collect commissions for buying and selling on behalf of customers. Having already paid business tax, requiring them to obtain business licenses is akin to double taxation. On the 28th, the Nantong County Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation, requesting the Department of Finance to interpret.</p>

<p>The Truth About the Ditch Digging Murder Case: The sensational and bizarre ditch digging murder case has been reported in previous newspapers. In order to seek accuracy, the reporter has learned the truth after several days of investigation. Wang Zijian opened a butcher shop, which suffered heavy losses and could not be sustained. At the time of the closure, he owed Zhang Changshan more than one hundred yuan for pigs. Zhang repeatedly demanded payment, leaving only a little more than twenty yuan unpaid. Around the Ghost Festival, Zhang came to demand payment again, and his words were even more intense. Wang said that he would definitely find a way to repay the debt and would not deduct a single cent. A few days later, Wang tried to find a way and got twenty yuan, which he personally delivered. Zhang insisted on full repayment, and the two sides started arguing. Zhang, with more people and greater strength, tied Wang to a wooden post in the pigsty with a rope, covered him with pig manure, and punched him repeatedly. Wang could only endure this situation and was powerless to resist. After being persuaded by neighbors, he was released. Wang, humiliated and angry, had the thought of death. Taking advantage of the unguarded moment, he hanged himself on a tree in front of Zhang's house. But how the body could reach a tree more than two zhang high is still a question. The county government has now arrested the murderer, Zhang Changshan and his son, for investigation and is summoning Zhang's neighbors, Liu Songling and others, to court for questioning.</p>

<p>The County Magistrate is Accused of Investigation: The current county magistrate, Li Maozeng, was previously accused by the former first district chief, Wan Diankui (now the eighth district chief), in the Suzhou High Court of abusing his power, illegally harming others, and requesting that the case be summoned for investigation. The court has now appointed Huang Cishan, the county magistrate of Dongtai, to come to Gaoyou for thorough investigation. Huang, due to lack of time, sent Section Chief Yuan Xizhi to handle the matter. Yuan arrived in Gaoyou the night before last and went to the county government yesterday to review the files and conduct secret inquiries among the people. It is reported that Section Chief Yuan left for the town this morning and returned to Dongtai.</p>

<p>Ten Armed Bandits Arrested on a Train: At about 7:00 p.m. last night, Train No. 4, which was departing from Nanjing, arrived at Danyang Station. Three men, about twenty years old, all with Haizhou accents, wearing blue cloth gowns, were seen getting off the train by Yang Yuanru, the patrolling chief of the sixth section. He found their behavior suspicious and immediately questioned them. The three men were evasive in their speech. Yang secretly summoned military police to arrest the three and found two box guns and fifty-nine bullets on their persons. They were immediately sent to the Danyang County Government for detention and will be brought back to the provincial capital for interrogation.</p>
<p>Labor Strike at the Cuilun Factory: The female workers of the Cuilun Silk Factory in this port are dissatisfied because the factory has stopped work and sold the dry cocoons stored in the factory. When wages were paid the day before yesterday, they agreed to not collect them. They gathered more than a hundred people to guard the accounting room, preventing the factory staff from entering or leaving. The factory demanded a return to work, but they ignored it and created a disturbance.

<p>Case of Illegally Selling the Guazhen Garrison Base: The Jiangdu County Government previously received an order from the Department of Civil Affairs to investigate the case of Hua He, Wu Shaozhi, local bullies in Guazhou, illegally selling the former Yangtze River Navy Garrison Base. Subsequently, the county ordered Liu Jun, the manager of the camp property, to go to investigate. Liu Jun replied that there was no record of whether the base was a garrison base. However, Wu Shaozhi presented an official deed and grain certificate to prove that it was private property. Wu presented the deed and certificate to the county for review. After receiving the report, the county government now plans to wait for Wu to present the deed and certificate for inspection before considering a solution.</p>

<p>Some Humble Opinions on College Student Guidance</p>
<p>Shao Mingjiu</p>
<p>College student guidance occupies a very important position in the administrative organizational system of a university. That goes without saying. But how to achieve practical results is a problem that is not easily solved. In our country, primary and secondary schools are still studying how to improve their guidance organizations and methods. They are willing to accept new and better methods and verify them in practice. Therefore, in recent years, primary and secondary school guidance has indeed shown some progress. Speaking of universities, there is some doubt. To be honest, college student guidance in our country has not made much progress to this day. This is a common phenomenon, not specific to one place or one school, let alone one guidance teacher. I very much hope that universities will work together to study this issue, especially in China, where education is not developed. We must study the organization and methods of college student guidance more carefully so that we can achieve good results and arouse students' attention to guidance. Now I would like to discuss three opinions on the reform of college student guidance with everyone.</p>
<p>(1) Breaking the Director System of Guidance Organization</p>
<p>Currently, there is no standard organization for guidance in general universities in our country, so they can only govern themselves. As far as I know, the names of university guidance organizations generally fall into the following three categories: (1) Director System, (2) Committee System, and (3) Advisor System. Among these organizations, let's not talk about the Committee System and the Advisor System, but only focus on the Director System. I think there are many drawbacks. First, the authority of the guidance director may not be implemented effectively. Second, the guidance office pays too much attention to rules and regulations, and everything is constrained, with little room for flexibility. Third, the guidance office lacks opportunities for contact with the various colleges, so the efficiency of handling affairs is reduced. Fourth, there are few opportunities for contact between teachers and students, so misunderstandings easily arise. Fifth, the emphasis is on the administrative affairs of the guidance office, lacking the promotion of academic research or encouragement of technical inventions. Sixth, it is not appropriate to organize the guidance office alone in terms of funding and talent. The so-called guidance has degenerated into a mechanical undertaking that operates according to regulations under a fixed organization. I believe that the university's guidance organization should be based on the principle of student life, changing the director to instructors, with the number depending on the size of the school's organization. If the organization is simple and the handling of affairs is relatively quick, the drawbacks of too strict organization can be avoided. Therefore, in recent years, universities have gradually tended towards new organizations. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Advertisements for Private Schools Must Not Confuse the Record-Filing Wording</h3>
<p>Advertisements for private schools that have been approved by the Municipal Education Bureau to establish, trial run, or improve are permitted by the Public Utilities Bureau to post announcements free of tax, and are only required to register the Xuan mark at the nearest advertisement management office.

The Public Utilities Bureau has ordered all advertisement management offices to comply.</p>

<p>▲ Huabu Scores Three Consecutive Goals in the Second Half The situation on the field was very even at the beginning, with both sides attacking and shooting at each other. However, both sides lost opportunities due to a lack of support. Halfway through the first half, Biefa advanced from the right wing and passed to the center forward. After a melee in front of the goal, center forward Gu Yifei shot the ball into Huabu's goal. Biefa won the first half with a score of one to zero. In the second half, Huabu greatly improved its performance. In less than five minutes, right inside Yao Jiasui broke through the goal, tying the score at one to one. With fifteen minutes remaining, center forward Dong Zhaobin broke the net again, reversing the defeat and winning with a score of two to one. In the last five minutes, right wing Yao Zhilong shot at the goal. The goalkeeper got the ball but lost it again, ending the game with a score of three to one.

Nanjing is an area where talents gather, and it is expected that many people will sign up to join, which will surely revitalize the tennis atmosphere in the capital.</p>
<h3>Swimming Crash Course</h3>
<p>Yu Binqi</p>
<p>If we look at it from a physiological point of view, it seems like a reckless and unreasonable act for humans to learn to swim. Everyone understands that fish cannot leave the water. Once they leave the water and are in the air, they will die. Conversely, humans depend entirely on air for survival. If they leave the air and go into the water, wouldn't they die like fish leaving the water and going into the air? But is this really the case? Because humans are the spirit of all things, as long as you can think of it and have the ambition to learn it, you will succeed in anything. Swimming may be a trivial skill, but it is related to life, family, and the nation, and it is of utmost importance. For detailed reasons why this is beneficial to life and the nation, please refer to the telegrams from Binqi and others to the Ministry of Education and the National Sports Conference published in the Shenbao on August 17, 1932, and the Shishi Xinbao on the 18th. This will make it clear that swimming is our urgent task. According to recent statistics, the interest of the Chinese people in swimming seems to be very strong. If you observe the Mingyuan, Hongkou, and Dongya in Shanghai, they are crowded from morning to night, which is a good phenomenon for the sports world. However, although they have a strong determination and are encouraged to bravely learn to swim, without proper training and guidance, they are blindly bumping around like they can't find their way, and it is difficult to get started. Therefore, some people have the will but not the strength and can only sigh at the water. Because my comrades do not abandon me, I often receive letters from various groups asking me to take the time to give guidance. I dare not refuse this kind of appointment and am very happy. Unfortunately, I am too busy and worry that I cannot be everywhere. In addition to apologizing, I offer you a shortcut to swimming here. If you read it carefully, understand it, and practice it in the swimming pool according to my shortcut, I can guarantee that you can swim automatically within one hour. A person who has never been in the water before will probably say that this is a very easy thing when he sees someone swimming. This is really the so-called "watching others carry the burden without feeling the weight." If you go into the water and the water reaches your chest, then your body will float up, and the five internal organs and six lungs in your chest seem to float up as well. Because breathing is short, a state of shortness of breath will appear. For beginners in this situation, how can they fight with the water if they are not guided step by step? Therefore, the basic way to swim is the crawl stroke. Once you have learned the crawl stroke, you have a foundation. After that, if you want to learn other strokes, you can follow the map and solve the problem easily. The practice method of the crawl stroke can be divided into three steps: kicking, stroking, and breathing. When a person enters the water for the first time, he may still feel all kinds of embarrassment when he stands properly. I have already said above that if you ask him to kick his feet, he will really be too scared to try. Why is this? Because the usual way for ordinary people to kick is to grab the pool railing with both hands, stretch their hands straight, and then kick. If you use this method to ask beginners to practice, it is really too profound. I can say assertively that even people with swimming talent cannot stretch and lift their feet straight using this method. If beginners approach the edge of the pool, first grab the stone railing of the pool with their right hand, put their left hand into the water about eight inches from the surface of the water, and hold the pool wall upside down with their fingers pointing down. Then straighten their body into a horizontal line, and then straighten their two feet. Relying on the supporting force of both hands, float the straightened body up, and kick up and down. The movement of kicking only uses the calf to kick, preferably like shivering, which can save a lot of energy. If you grab the stone railing of the pool with your right hand and hold it upside down with your left hand, but your body still cannot float up, then you can use your right hand that is grabbing the stone trough of the swimming pool to lean your arm against the edge of the pool, and the left hand below still holds it upside down. Using this method, even a very fat person can be guaranteed to easily float their body. This secret is what I have learned from years of practice. I have read through Chinese and Western books on swimming and have not mentioned it, so I think it is the most convenient shortcut for beginners to learn to swim in the first step. Kicking requires patience, because it is dull and boring, and it is not good to interrupt it. You must practice it purely and naturally until you can kick without using the strength of your hands.</p>

<h3>Song Cai Flew to Beijing Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Aircraft Encountered Obstacles</p>
<p>Took Off After Repairs</p>
<p>Song Ziwen, Acting President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, completed his official business in Shanghai and, together with Cai Tingkai, Commander of the 19th Route Army, and secretaries and advisors of the Ministry of Finance, flew to Beijing yesterday morning on Song's own Sikorsky aircraft. Song, Cai, and others were originally scheduled to depart at 6 AM yesterday morning, but were delayed until 10 AM due to engine repairs. At the same time, Cai's original plan to fly directly to Wuhan to meet Chiang after arriving in Beijing was also postponed to this morning. As for this visit of Cai, Minister of Finance Song had agreed to negotiate a total of 700,000 yuan for the financial problems of Fujian. The reorganization of the Fujian Provincial Government will be decided after meeting Chiang.</p>
<p>▲ Delayed Due to Aircraft Damage The Sikorsky aircraft was wiped clean of its components and fuselage by Nai Tuo, a professor at the Aviation School of the Ministry of Military Affairs, and pilot Stenson at around 6 AM yesterday morning. At 6:10 AM, Dr. Young, the American advisor to the Ministry of Finance, arrived alone by car first. The pilot started to crank the right engine first, then the left engine, but it could not be turned due to damage. The pilot Stenson disassembled part of the engine to check and found that the fire door inside was blocked and could not be opened up and down. However, at the same time, due to insufficient electricity, it could not be started even after repairs. At this time, Song and Cai, along with Lu Wenlan and Huang Chundao, secretary of the Ministry of Finance, led several guards and arrived at the scene in three cars. Song and Cai, upon seeing the situation, had no choice but to rest temporarily in the car and wait for the two pilots to repair the aircraft. The two pilots closed the right engine again to focus on repairing the left engine. After three and a half hours, and with the addition of electricity by the Western professor of the Hangzhou Aviation School with a hand-cranked generator, the engine began to move. It was already 9:50 AM. Then, both engines were fully started. Song and Cai then took the newspaper out of the car and boarded the plane with their secretaries. At 10 AM, Nai Tuo and pilot Stenson piloted the aircraft away from the ground.</p>
<p>▲ Going to Wuhan This Morning Those who accompanied Song and Cai included Lu Wenlan, Director of the Songjiang Salt Affairs Audit Sub-Office, Huang Chundao of the Ministry of Finance, and American advisor Dr. Yang Ge, a total of five people. Cai originally planned to fly to Jiujiang and transfer to Hankou to meet Military Committee Chairman Chiang Kai-shek after arriving in Beijing yesterday. However, due to engine damage and prolonged repairs, it was estimated that there would not be enough time after arriving in Beijing, so he temporarily changed his plan to depart from Nanjing this morning, still going to Jiujiang first, and then flying to Hankou to meet Chiang.</p>
<p>▲ Song Discusses Financial Matters When Song Ziwen was about to leave, he talked to a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency about the blockade of the Northeast Customs. The government has no new measures at present and will continue to handle it in the same way as before. Regarding the suspension of payment of the Japanese Gengzi Indemnity, the Japanese had already transferred a part of the Dalian tax once, but the second transfer has not yet arrived. If the Japanese do not continue to remit this tax in the future, whether our side will implement the suspension of payment of the Japanese portion of the Gengzi Indemnity is something that I (Song refers to himself) do not know at present. I completely listen to the government's decision on the Dalian tariff matter. As for acting as the President of the Executive Yuan, because no one is responsible for the Executive Yuan, I have no choice but to act temporarily. The abolition of taels and the adoption of the yuan will not be announced for the time being before a decision is made, but the government has decided to proceed with this matter. As for the paper money tax, as mentioned in today's newspapers, the tax has already been received. The tax rate was originally determined by the government to be 2.5%, but now, due to the difficulties of the banking industry, it will be changed to 1.25%. This matter must be decided after I go to Beijing and ask the Legislative Yuan to approve it. The date of return to Shanghai has not been determined, but it will probably not be more than a few days.</p>
<p>▲ Cai Discusses Fujian Matters Furthermore, according to Cai Tingkai, who spoke to a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency, the plan to suppress the bandits in Fujian Province has now been completely decided. After arriving in Beijing this time, he will report to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in Wuhan. However, whether this can be achieved immediately after arriving in Beijing today depends on whether there is enough time. As for the financial and reorganization of the provincial government of Fujian, it was not discussed in Shanghai. Although the date of return to Shanghai has not been determined, it will not be long. However, according to Lu Wenlan, who was traveling with Cai, regarding the financial affairs of Fujian, after Cai's meeting with Finance Minister Song in Shanghai, Song had agreed to provide a monthly subsidy of 500,000 yuan, plus a special fund of 200,000 yuan that he had negotiated with Song on behalf of Cai before Cai came to Shanghai. It is estimated that there is still a shortage of 100,000 yuan, but it should not be difficult to raise. The reorganization of the provincial government of Fujian was not discussed in Shanghai, but it is hoped that a decision can be made after meeting with Chiang. Fan Qiwu is likely to agree to take responsibility for the position of Financial Commissioner of Fujian because Fan is one of his own people. Chen Zhenru is determined to go abroad and will not go to Fujian. As for the bandit suppression plan, it has been completely decided and can be reported to Chiang face to face when he meets him.</p>

<p>More than 150 Representatives from Various Provinces Arrived</p>
<p>The Meeting Continues Today to Discuss Proposals</p>
<p>The Chinese National Anti-Opium Association held a national congress at the China Society yesterday at 7 PM. Over 150 representatives from anti-opium associations from various regions and from all walks of life gathered together. The meeting commenced at 7:30 PM. During the banquet, Wang Jingqi, Li Denghui, Huang Jiawei, and others from the association delivered opening speeches and reports. Zhang Zhijiang and representatives from anti-opium associations in various regions also gave speeches and reports. The meeting adjourned at 9:30 PM, and it was decided to continue the meeting today to discuss various proposals. The details are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>▲ Representatives Present: Wang Jingqi, President of the Anti-Opium Association; Li Denghui; Huang Jiawei, Executive Director; Zhang Zhijiang, Central Committee Member; Wu Xiaolai from the Shanghai business community (representing Shao Piao); Wu Mai, Director of Publicity for the National Lawyers Association; Lin Kecong from the Shanghai Women's Relief Association; and representatives from anti-opium associations in various regions, including: Hu Jinglu from Suian County, Zhejiang; Ouyang Bokang from Nanjing; Zhong Dacan from Shangyu; Li Fei from Dinghai; Yang Jusong from Zhuji; Yang Zhonggao Dong Sheng; Yang Renrong from Fuzhou; Huang Jinsheng from Yuyao; Pan Shenghua and Zhou Ji from Wenzhou; Tang Qitao from Fenghua; Wu Zhenduo from Shanxi; Wu Zhongmin from Xiashi; Qian Xiaode from Shengxian; Ling Yian from Wuxing; Xu Shu from Chun'an; Tang Bingwen from Haining; Xu Sheng from Xiaoshan; Zhang Renshan from Pei County; Ji Nian from Jiande; Wang Xianglin from Tongxiang; Lin Shize from Xiaofeng; Zheng Dongxiang from Long County; Wang Ziqing from Wuyi; Shen Tu Yu from Tiantai; He Li from Dongyang; Yan Baohang from Liaoning; Li Fengchu from Jiangxi; Zhu Chonghua from Changshu; as well as representatives from the Rickshaw Union, the Shanghai YMCA, the Red Cross, the Shanghai Medical Association, the Rationality Society, and other organizations, totaling over 150 people.</p>
<p>▲ Opening Speech: President Wang Jingqi delivered an opening speech, stating, "Fellow comrades, today marks the opening of the National Anti-Opium Representatives Conference in Shanghai. Comrades who have come from afar braving the summer heat, your enthusiasm and perseverance are deeply appreciated. On behalf of the Chinese National Anti-Opium Association, I extend my warmest welcome. It has been twenty-one years since the founding of the Republic of China. We all share the unspeakable pain of the state of our politics and social customs. Why has China become so corrupt today? Why is the opium scourge so rampant? Why has our international reputation fallen so low? In my personal opinion, it is because in the past twenty-one years, we have focused too much on destructive work and have failed to pay sufficient attention to constructive work, especially psychological reconstruction. The opium problem is a clear manifestation of the psychology of China's undesirable elements. This problem is now inextricably linked to the livelihood of the Chinese people. Diplomacy, finance, transportation, agriculture – all are affected by the opium issue. Other countries use science to alleviate the suffering of the people and increase productivity. However, in our country, it has the opposite effect. Take transportation as an example. In other countries, railways, automobiles, and airplanes facilitate the travel and transportation of goods for the people. But in our country, without new industries or new construction, these advancements only serve to amplify the power of the opium demon. Those who plant, transport, sell, and consume opium are adopting these latest tools to expand their sales and facilitate transportation. Rumors are difficult to verify, but the slogan 'aviation to save the country' is circulating. Some say that aviation is being used solely to transport opium. When will the Chinese revolution succeed? The survival of the Chinese nation depends on the capacity and speed of psychological reconstruction. Among the endeavors of psychological reconstruction, our anti-opium work should serve as a touchstone for testing the resilience of the people and as the strongest and most enduring foundation for national morality. All of us anti-opium comrades should deeply believe in the greatness of our mission and strive to fight for it."</p>
<p>▲ Report on the Process: Li Denghui reported on the proceedings of the congress, stating, "Originally, we planned to hold the congress in Hangzhou, but due to various reasons, we changed the venue to Shanghai. Through the active preparations of the association, overcoming many difficulties, we were able to establish the congress today. Currently, 120 representatives from anti-opium associations in eleven provinces and regions have registered. Representatives from places like Singapore and Taiwan are also participating. We have received over 90 proposals. I hope everyone will work together to achieve the goal of completely eliminating opium."</p>
<p>▲ Speeches from All Sectors: After the report, representatives from anti-opium associations in Liaoning, Singapore, Taiwan, and other places stood up one after another to report on the progress of anti-opium work in their respective regions. Subsequently, Zhang Zhijiang stood up to speak about the scourge of opium, stating that the poison of opium not only subjects China to drug addiction but also endangers the country's survival. This speech garnered enthusiastic applause from the entire audience.</p>
<p>▲ Today's Agenda: Finally, Executive Director Huang Jiawei reported that due to time constraints, the meeting would have to be temporarily adjourned. The meeting will resume tomorrow (i.e., today) at 9 AM and will continue through lunchtime. It will then reconvene in the afternoon. During tomorrow's (30th) meeting, representatives from anti-opium associations in Hebei, Jiangxi, Guangdong, and other provinces, as well as Lin Kecong from the Women's Relief Association and Wu Mai from the National Lawyers Association, will deliver speeches. Various issues will also be discussed. The meeting adjourned at 9:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Representatives from Various Organizations in Hongkou Petitioned the Municipal Government Yesterday</h3>
<p>Negotiating Regarding the Actions of the Japanese Outside the Established Order</p>
<p>The various district branches of the Citizens' United Association in Hongkou, as well as the commercial associations of Jiaxing Road, Tongzhou Road, Dongyouheng Road, Hanbury Road, Broadway Road, Yangshupu Road, East and West Huade Road, Yinzhang Road, Suzhou Road, Avenue Edward VII, Haining Road, North Xizang Road, North Jiangxi Road, Chuanbao Road, and other organizations, held an emergency joint meeting the day before to discuss local security issues. They resolved to ban the activities of Japanese ronin organizations such as the Japanese Police Corps in various districts of Hongkou in order to ensure commercial safety. They elected six representatives to petition the municipal government and request negotiations. These representatives went to the Shanghai Municipal Government in Fenglinqiao yesterday morning at 10 AM to petition. The details are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>▲ The Representatives' Petition: The representatives of the organizations, including Zhang Xianfang, Wang Rongtang, Qiu Jialiang, Xing Guxiang, Liu Zhongying, and Zheng Dongshan, submitted a petition to the municipal government, requesting to meet with the mayor. As the mayor was away on official business, Mr. Zhu Weiyao of the Second Section met with them. Wang Rongtang, Zheng Dongshan, Liu Zhongying, Zhang Xianfang, and others spoke in succession, stating the purpose of their petition. In addition to the detailed presentation, the petition included the following points: (A) Shanghai's commerce has suffered immensely since the January 28th Incident. Now, the Japanese Marines are staging demonstrations and patrolling the district, and Japanese soldiers are venturing into the war zone to observe, causing great rumors. It is requested that such actions be strictly rejected in the future to avoid misunderstandings. (B) The local market is operating as usual. Maintaining local order is the responsibility of the Shanghai Municipal Council. Japanese ronin are freely organizing Red Shirt Groups and Japanese Police Corps, parading on the streets and frequently moving around, causing residents to feel fear and preventing them from engaging in business with peace of mind. It is requested that the mayor negotiate with the Japanese side and the Shanghai Municipal Council to promptly ban these groups and maintain local order. (C) At 11 PM on the 10th of this month, over 50 Japanese soldiers in trucks and motorcycles went to the factory of Chen Wanxing on Huasheng Road and Yangzhou Road, injuring several Chinese workers and destroying property in a violent act. It is requested that the mayor promptly initiate serious negotiations, demanding (1) punishment of the perpetrators, (2) compensation, (3) an apology, and (4) guarantees that such barbaric acts will not occur again, in order to appease public anger.</p>
<p>▲ The Municipal Government's Reply: Mr. Zhu Weiyao of the Second Section of the Municipal Government, after hearing the representatives' statements, replied as follows: Regarding point A, he can declare on behalf of the government that the Japanese side has repeatedly requested to visit various districts, but the municipal government has repeatedly rejected these requests. However, the Japanese side has resorted to sophistry. This time, the Public Security Bureau sent police to accompany them on their visits to the war zone. Regarding unauthorized visits, negotiations will certainly be conducted. As for points B and C, they have been detailed in the petition and will be forwarded to the mayor for review and action. The representatives expressed satisfaction with the response and left the government building, nearing noon.</p>
<h3>Japanese Commander Sugisaka Issues Another Declaration</h3>
<p>Cannot Tolerate Extreme Patriotic Movements in China</p>
<p>Even More Absurd and Exaggerated than the Previous Announcement to Residents</p>
<p>According to Shishi News Agency, after the Japanese Marine Corps Commander Sugisaka posted the so-called "Announcement to Residents" in the Hongkou area a few days ago, he issued hundreds of mimeographed declarations yesterday, distributing them to Japanese residents in Shanghai. The wording is absurd, and the content is incomprehensible. Here is a translation of the declaration for reference: Declaration: Recently, rumors of renewed fighting have been rampant among Chinese people in Zhabei, Sichuan Road, and other places, causing many to move. Some Japanese residents have also easily believed these rumors, feeling uneasy day and night. This has caused concern among both Chinese and Japanese residents. However, Japan, which has made great sacrifices for the permanent peace of Shanghai, will never take any action that could provoke another conflict. However, covert organizations such as the Blood Soul Anti-Traitor Corps, which have sprung up everywhere in China, are creating terrifying rumors to cover up their violent acts. This morning at 10 AM, Ouyang Hong of the Zhabei Fifth District Headquarters of the Chinese Public Security Bureau came to the Marine Corps Headquarters to explain the recent rumors to the Commander. The Commander earnestly stated that if the Chinese side can take responsibility for suppressing all anti-Japanese movements, it would prevent the occurrence of unfortunate incidents. Therefore, he hopes that the Bureau can cooperate closely with the Japanese side to vigorously suppress these anti-Japanese organizations. As for the Japanese authorities stationed in Shanghai, they cannot tolerate these Chinese anti-Japanese conspiracy groups, which lack justice and humanity (?). We are surprised that the Chinese authorities do not suppress those who disrupt public order (?) and damage Sino-Japanese relations (?), allowing them to run rampant everywhere, causing a series of terrifying incidents. This attitude is highly suspicious. As for our Japanese residents in Shanghai, do not believe in rumors and disturb yourselves. You can live and work in peace. If any unfortunate incidents do occur, Japan has the Third Fleet's elite naval force and the Marine Corps' combat-ready land force in Shanghai. All of these forces are more powerful than they were before the January 28th Incident, so there is no need to worry. The Commander will do his best to protect the residents for the sake of their peaceful lives and work. You can all rest assured. This is specially announced.</p>
<h3>Japan Sends Additional Naval Forces to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Inspection to be Held on September 5th</p>
<p>▲ Japanese Warships Gather in Shanghai: The Third Fleet of the Japanese Navy, dispatched to Shanghai after the war, is currently being inspected by Commander Sakonji upstream of the Yangtze River. He is expected to return to Shanghai on September 2nd. According to the Third Fleet Headquarters in Shanghai, after Sakonji returns to Shanghai on the flagship Izumo, he will convene a large-scale demonstration inspection of the Third Fleet's 15 torpedo squadrons and 24 destroyer squadrons, including eight ships such as the Yanagi, Momo, Kashi, Hinoki, Fuji, Susuki, Tsuta, and others, as well as a portion of the Japanese warships in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River in Shanghai on September 5th.</p>
<p>▲ Marine Corps Continues to Arrive: The Japanese Marine Corps in Shanghai has reached 3,000 personnel, with a structure similar to that of the army, including both infantry and artillery. A telegram from Sasebo states that another 300 Marine Corps soldiers will arrive in Shanghai on September 6th aboard the special service ship Nojima, designated as a replacement unit. They will land at the Osaka Pier and join the various units in Shanghai.</p>
<p>▲ Aviation Personnel Transferred to Shanghai: The Japanese ship Nagasaki Maru arrived in Shanghai yesterday, bringing another batch of Japanese police officers from Kobe and Nagasaki to Shanghai to expand the special police force of the Japanese Consulate. Several petty officers from the Omura Aviation Unit's flying squadron have also been secretly dispatched to Shanghai. These aviation personnel have also been assigned to the Marine Corps for deployment and use.</p>
<p>▲ Tokiwa Cruiser Returns Home: The Japanese light cruiser Tokiwa, which was dispatched to Shanghai to participate in the fighting during the January 28th Incident, has now received orders from the Naval Ministry to return to Sasebo for rest. Yesterday, the ship departed Shanghai from the Yangshupu Osaka Pier. Japanese residents in Shanghai regarded this ship as the last vessel to return home after the Shanghai Battle, and many representatives went to the pier to bid farewell.</p>
<h3>The Seawall at Wusong is in Danger</h3>
<p>The Municipal Committee Sends a Telegram Urging Swift Repairs</p>
<p>The seawall around the Wusong Fort and Taiwan area has suffered considerable damage from Japanese artillery fire. The Jiangnan Seawall Project Committee previously resolved to allocate funds for repairs, but this has not yet been implemented. Recently, the seawall has been further eroded by autumn tides, creating a dangerous situation. Tang Chengzong, a member of the Wusong Municipal Committee, sent a telegram yesterday urging repairs, stating: "To the Honorable Jiangnan Seawall Project Rehabilitation Committee: Due to recent continuous winds and tides, the Jiangyan seawall along the Wusong River, which was bombarded by Japanese forces, is in a state of collapse. The Danjiabang area is also deteriorating daily. If a large autumn tide occurs, a major disaster is inevitable. Committee members have witnessed the current situation and are deeply concerned. A special telegram is sent urging you to swiftly implement the original plan as soon as possible to prevent any eventuality. This is of the utmost urgency."</p>

<h3>Various Industries Jointly Telegraph a Request for the Postponement of the "Responsible Transportation Regulations"</h3>
<p>Various trade associations in the city telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Railways yesterday regarding the "Regulations on Responsible Transportation by Railway Freight Cars," requesting that commercial representatives be convened to discuss the regulations before they are implemented. The original telegram stated: "To the Honorable Executive Yuan and Ministry of Railways in Nanjing: Since the promulgation of the 'Regulations on Responsible Transportation by Railway Freight Cars,' various businesses have learned of its contents. Upon detailed review, the so-called 'responsible transportation' is, in fact, nothing more than an attempt to increase freight rates by 10%, while at the same time adding 19 exceptions in Article 36, leaving plenty of room for escape in the event of an incident. To call this 'responsible' is the height of absurdity. Moreover, in addition to increasing freight rates by 10%, there are as many as 11 types of miscellaneous fees. It is still unknown whether merchants will receive compensation in the event of an incident, but they must first pay an additional 10% freight and 11 types of miscellaneous fees, creating a heavy burden. Where is the convenience for merchants? Furthermore, it has established priority shipping and most priority shipping categories, with increased freight rates ranging from 30% to 60%. The number of railway cars is limited. Once this precedent is set, those who pay ordinary freight rates will be subject to long-term delays due to a lack of vehicles, forcing them to pay extra for priority shipping. This strategy is cleverly devised, but it is the merchants who transport goods who suffer. Railway companies transporting goods on behalf of customers is a business activity that should be governed by the national civil law and conducted in a spirit of consultation with merchants. How can it wield its overwhelming power with a threatening tone? Yesterday, we read a telegram from the special party departments of the two railways regarding this matter, which contained a peculiar argument: anyone who discusses the 'Regulations on Responsible Transportation' is a 'traitorous merchant.' This kind of arrogance is no different from 'punishing those who whisper and exterminating those who slander.' The country is guiding people towards the realm of democracy, but there is this abnormal phenomenon, which is extremely disheartening and makes it difficult to remain silent. It is reasonable to telegram Your Honorable Yuan and Ministry to review this matter and, following the example of last year's National Commercial Transportation Conference, allow commercial representatives to be convened to jointly discuss the Transportation Regulations before setting a date for implementation, in order to avoid obstacles. We earnestly request your approval. From the Shanghai Sugar Industry, Color Printing Industry, Aircraft Industry, Ginseng and Bird's Nest Industry, Dried Goods Industry, Silk and Satin Industry, Rice Shops, Seafood and Grocery Industry, Jute Bag Industry, Brick and Tile Industry, Mercerized Cotton Weaving Industry, Department Stores, Knitting Industry, Coal Ash Factory Industry, Lime Distribution Industry, and North-South Goods Exchange Industry, and over 230 other trade associations, with deep respect."</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grain Industry Opposes Responsible Transportation</h3>
<p>If Implemented, Shipments Will be Temporarily Suspended</p>
<p>The Shanghai Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Trade Association convened an emergency meeting of eight trade groups yesterday afternoon. 140 to 150 people attended, and representatives from the Bean and Rice Industry and the Flour Industry were also present. The meeting was called to order at 3 PM by Chairman Gu Xinyi, who reported on the purpose of the meeting, stating that the meeting was convened because the Railway Responsible Transportation was scheduled to be implemented on September 1st, and the implementation date had arrived. The association urgently discussed how to respond. Subsequently, Chen Ziyi, the representative of the Bean and Rice Industry, reported that the Ministry of Railways had convened relevant commercial organizations in the Bank Association to explain the reasons for increasing the transportation price of Responsible Transportation. Chen represented his industry to participate, and read the regulations for Responsible Transportation established by the railway in public. Then, the chairman said that the industry shipped the most grain along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, so it was urgent to discuss a response. After discussion, the committee decided that among the three points of the brief explanation of the implementation of responsible transportation published by the Ministry of Railways, the true picture of the survey was quoted as saying that the railway freight rates were very fair, but merchants felt painful because the transportation companies added 50% to 10% to the handling fee. In order to provide a reason for the additional 10% of the responsibility freight, the transportation company will defend themselves. The association will publish its views to the Ministry of Railways in various newspapers. At the same time, it will send letters to merchants in Pukou, Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Changshu, and other locations, so that if the railway is implemented on September 1st, all incoming goods will be temporarily suspended. The goods are being converted into ships and sailing boats. The discussion was over, and it was already 7:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Northeast Postal Workers Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>A Total of Ninety People, Fifteen Remain in Yantai Due to Illness</p>
<p>Scheduled to Report to the Head Office This Morning</p>
<p>One hundred and five Northeast postal workers, travelling from Tianjin on the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s ship "Fosheng" to Shanghai, arrived in Shanghai at 8:00 AM yesterday, due to the Fosheng encountering wind en route, causing a slower voyage. The Shanghai Bureau of the Postal Administration and the Postal Workers' Union both dispatched representatives in advance to greet them at the dock. However, when the group passed through Yantai, fifteen of them fell ill and went ashore to recuperate in Yantai. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Arrival in Shanghai: The postal workers all belonged to inland bureaus in the Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang postal districts, totaling one hundred and five. They were all low-ranking postal workers such as mail carriers and laborers. They entered the customs from the Northeast at the end of last month and had been滞留 in Tianjin for almost a month. It was not until the 24th of this month that they received a general order from the head office, assigning them to work in Shanghai and Hangzhou. The postal workers then boarded the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s ship "Fosheng" southward on the 25th.</p>
<p>▲ Part of the Group Remained in Yantai: Shortly after the Fosheng set sail, when the ship passed through Yantai, fifteen of the postal workers, including postal carriers Zhang Guoshun, Shan Yongtai, Gao Wanzhong, Yin Fulong, Sun Yunqing, Wang Gaosheng, Zhang Zifeng, Zhang Naihai, Zhang Nailing, and Li Yurui, had become unwell. Furthermore, having grown up in the north, they were unaccustomed to sea travel, which caused them to suffer from seasickness. They disembarked in Yantai and were sent to a hospital by the local post office for recuperation. Therefore, the number of postal workers who arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning was only ninety.</p>
<p>▲ Arrival in Shanghai: Those who went to the Waibaidu Bridge Huashun Wharf on Gongping Road to greet them yesterday morning included two secretaries from the head office, Deputy Postal Director Dai Baoxin from the Shanghai Bureau, Chen Shengyang, Lao Jiemin, Gao Zongrui from the Postal Workers' Union, Cao Chongye, and more than twenty others from the Postal Labor Union. They all went to the wharf at 6:00 AM yesterday to wait. After the postal workers disembarked, they all boarded the mail delivery vehicles waiting at the wharf and drove to the Jingwu Athletic Association in Fudeli, Yokohama Road, to rest. They are scheduled to report to the head office again this morning. Except for three who will be sent to the Hangzhou Bureau to serve, the remaining eighty-seven will all remain in the Shanghai Bureau for placement.</p>
<p>▲ Representatives' Talk: The Datong News Agency reporter went to the Athletic Association yesterday afternoon to interview Na Wenqing (Manchu), Dong Sien, Xu Dianshuang, and other representatives of the postal workers. According to them, they were greatly threatened and enticed by the police and border police (organized by the Japanese) of the puppet state in the Northeast to stay and serve in the puppet bureau. However, we always put the motherland first and would rather abandon our families and brave dangers to enter the customs, and we will never serve the puppet state. It is also understood that only seven of the postal workers brought their families, and the rest were mostly left outside the customs because the puppet state's checks were extremely strict.</p>
<h3>Material Donations to the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteers</h3>
<p>▲ Sanyu Middle School Donates Wireless Radio: The Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteers Support Association previously received a letter from Jiangzhe Sanyu Middle School stating that the school is now closed and will donate the remaining food expenses and a wireless radio to the volunteers. The radio is a "Kai Luo" brand with four vacuum tubes, two large speakers, and all other electrical components. The original price was two hundred and several tens of yuan. Because it is an ordinary machine and not suitable for military use, they are willing to sell it at a 30% discount and donate the proceeds to the volunteers. The Support Association sent someone to pick it up yesterday and temporarily store it in the association. Those in all circles who need a radio are welcome to contact the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteers Support Association at Ren'an Lane, Guling Road. Not only can you get a practical radio, but you can also indirectly benefit the volunteers, a win-win situation. It is believed that there will be no shortage of enthusiastic people.</p>
<p>▲ Daming Company Donates Anti-Wind and Smoke Goggles: The Daming Optical Company, in response to the Japanese invaders using smoke bombs to attack our Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteers, has specially made a type of goggles that can prevent wind and smoke. They are of good quality and inexpensive, making them very suitable for military use. The company has already donated a large quantity of these goggles to the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteers Support Association, demonstrating its enthusiasm. It is said that the company, in order to strictly prevent traitors from aiding the enemy, requires those who purchase them to have proper proof. However, patriotic people who purchase them as gifts for the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteers will be charged at cost, expressing their great welcome.</p>
<h3>Two National Goods Organizations Welcome Zheng Bulun and Chen Shaofu</h3>
<p>Representative Zheng Speaks on the Reasons for Slow Sales of National Goods</p>
<p>The China National Goods Maintenance Association and the Shanghai Citizens' National Goods Promotion Association jointly held a tea party yesterday to welcome Zheng Bulun, representative of the Java Chinese Chamber of Commerce, and Chen Shaofu, curator of the National Goods Exhibition Hall of the Ministry of Industry. More than fifty people, including Chen Binghui and Fang Jiange, attended. First, Chairman Chen Yiting delivered the opening speech, saying, "Today, our associations jointly welcome Representative Zheng Bulun and Curator Chen Shaofu, and we are honored that comrades from various factories have braved the heat to attend. Zheng is a practitioner of promoting national goods. For twenty years, he has been working hard overseas, sparing no effort. This time, he was ordered to return to China and come to Shanghai: (1) to investigate the production of national goods, (2) to visit national goods factories and inspect the condition of their products, and he plans to select various fine national goods that meet the needs of the compatriots in the South Seas, send them to Java and other places, and promote them as much as possible." Then, everyone stood up and bowed to the two guests in welcome. Next, Zheng Bulun gave a speech, saying, "I am truly undeserving of such a welcome. The reason why the promotion of national goods overseas has not been effective is due to the following two shortcomings: (1) the goods shipped often do not match the samples at the time of order, and (2) many national goods do not meet the needs [of overseas customers]. I hope that everyone present will pay attention, correct, and improve these issues. Moreover, I feel that the following three points are obstacles to the promotion of national goods: (1) unequal treaties have not been abolished, (2) there are no Chinese-funded banks overseas, and (3) there are no Chinese ships sailing overseas. If these three points cannot be achieved, there is no hope for the development of national goods." Next, Chen Shaofu gave a speech, saying, "Our museum plans to hold a three-week anniversary on September 9th and hold a national goods exhibition. Therefore, I was ordered to come to Shanghai to collect national goods samples for the competition. I would like to ask your association for assistance and hope that national goods groups and merchants will cooperate with our museum." Then, representatives from various factories spoke one after another, offering many words of encouragement. At around 5:00 PM, everyone took a photo, had refreshments, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>British Public Bus Workers Petitioned Government Agencies Yesterday</h3>
<p>Five Representatives Arrested and Immediately Released</p>

<p>▲ Petitioned Party and Government: Public bus worker representatives Wang Xingmao, Shi Baoshan, and others went to the municipal government yesterday morning to petition, demanding a swift mediation to maintain the livelihood of the workers. They were received by Secretary Zhang Tingrong, who replied that the municipal government was already mediating and hoped that the workers would wait patiently for a resolution. They then went to the municipal party headquarters to petition and were received by Zhong Quan of the People's Training Section, who promised to convey the message to the standing committee and work with the municipal government to find a solution quickly. The representatives were satisfied and returned.</p>
<p>▲ Arrested and Immediately Released: Public bus worker representatives Wang Xingmao, Shi Baoshan, and others returned to Room 61 of the China Hotel on Ermalu after petitioning the party and government agencies yesterday morning.

<h3>Nanjing Road Merchants and Citizens Express Their Views on the Sanyou Factory Dispute</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Nanjing Road Business Association and the First District Branch of Citizens' Association submitted petitions yesterday to the Central Party Headquarters in Nanjing, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Industry, and the Municipal Government Social Affairs Bureau and Municipal Party Headquarters in Shanghai regarding the Sanyou Industrial Society factory closure and labor unrest. They requested a swift and impartial resolution in accordance with the law to maintain national goods industry and seek social peace. The two petitions are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ Petition to the Central Party Headquarters and National Government: Petition requesting the Shanghai Municipal Government or to send personnel to swiftly resolve the Sanyou Industrial Society factory closure dispute impartially and in accordance with the law. According to a letter from member Sanyou Industrial Society, which stated (The original letter is the same as the letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, which was seen in the previous report on the Chamber of Commerce's letter to the Municipal Government, omitted here), and so on to the association. Based on this, the reason and facts that Sanyou Society is unable to resume operations at the Yinxianggang factory have been repeatedly reported to the Shanghai Party and government authorities, and have been verified by reputable accountants appointed by the Municipal Government. Therefore, in the spirit of ruling the country by law, the matter should be swiftly arbitrated impartially in accordance with current industrial and commercial regulations. Otherwise, if the workers are allowed to make arbitrary and illegal demands, the truth will be obscured. Not only will the entire labor and management of Sanyou Society inevitably perish together, which is detrimental to all, but it will also cause great panic and discourage those who are engaged in real industry, hindering the budding Chinese industry, which is worrying for the future. The association, as a group of citizens and merchants, has a clearer view and feels a sense of crisis, so it cannot remain silent. It respectfully submits this petition, earnestly requesting your government to swiftly instruct the Shanghai Municipal Government or send personnel to arbitrate impartially in accordance with the law, stop the workers' demands and actions outside the law, so as to maintain the industry and seek social peace, which would be a great favor. (The rest is omitted)</p>
<p>▲ Petition to the Municipal Party and Government Agencies: Petition requesting impartial arbitration of the Sanyou Industrial Society factory closure dispute in accordance with the law, and a swift determination of a resolution plan to maintain the endangered industry and cultivate the fundamental livelihood of the people. The Yinxianggang factory of Sanyou Society is experiencing a work stoppage, causing twists and turns, and the dispute is intensifying, so that it has been delayed for nearly two months without resolution. The association, as a group of fellow citizens and merchants, has a clearer view. After examining the reasons for the factory closure, it is found that the factory's buildings are simple, the equipment is inherently unsound, and it has been eroded for many years and is unusable. After the January 28th Incident this year, it was occupied by the Japanese army, causing the machinery, accessories, and utensils to be destroyed. In addition, the economic turnover is inflexible, and the sales of goods are sluggish. After checking the factory's actual situation, it is indeed unable to resume work and has no choice but to close the factory in pain, in order to overcome the difficulties and preserve the remnants, indirectly still to maintain the lives of the workers in employment. If we must follow the illegal demands of the workers at the Yinxianggang factory and force the factory to open, it will inevitably affect all operations and cause everyone to perish together, which will cause even greater panic. The problem of unemployment is a major problem for the entire country and society, and the government should plan and solve it as a whole. If we insist on arranging workers' positions and use force to demand the opening of the factory by impossible means, making it impossible for the factory to operate freely, it is not only not allowed by law, but also the country's credit will be lost. Unexpectedly, the workers of Sanyou Society have persistent prejudices and create complications, and the dispute is intensifying. If this continues for a long time, not only will both labor and management of Sanyou Society be harmed, but it will also discourage entrepreneurs, which is worrying for the future when it is just budding. It is heard that your department has scheduled arbitration and a resolution is expected, which is very gratifying. However, the association is deeply afraid that the workers will obscure the situation in various ways and make demands outside the law, so it dares to submit this petition. It earnestly requests your department to review the case files reported by Sanyou Society in the past, and in the spirit of ruling the country by law, strictly correct the workers and make them obey in accordance with the current industrial and commercial regulations. It also respectfully requests that when deciding on this case, a feasible resolution plan be carefully drafted, so as to preserve the entire business of Sanyou Society and ensure the lives of the majority of employed workers, which is to maintain industry and benefit the people's livelihood, which would be a great favor.

<h3>New Hurricane Warning Signal Method Established by the Jianghai Customs</h3>
<p>Effective September 1st</p>
<p>Black Ball During the Day, Red Light at Night</p>
<p>The Jianghai Customs established a signal method of hanging balls and lights in 1929 to warn of hurricanes. Gu Xingen, the acting director of the port administration, has changed to a new method to facilitate the inspection of warning signals by merchant ships. Starting from September 1st, the hurricane warning signals originally located at the Lujiazui flag station will be cancelled and relocated to three locations: the customs rooftop, the Lanlu flag station, and the flagpole on the water tower of the Pingan Shipyard. The regulations are: (1) When the weather is predicted to be severe, two black balls will be suspended, one above the other, during the day, and one red light will be hung at night; (2) When a strong wind or hurricane is predicted, two black balls will be suspended, one above the other, during the day, and two red lights will be hung in a straight line at night. At the same time, a warning cannon will be fired once each at the Lujiazui and Lanlu flag stations in Pudong. This signal is to supplement the report of the hurricane and wind signals by the Xujiahui Observatory's signal tower, in order to warn merchant ships in the port. The acting port director issued Notice No. 8 yesterday, notifying the shipping companies to check.</p>
<h3>Jiangtian Collides with a Civilian Boat</h3>
<p>Five Drowned...Two Children Rescued</p>
<p>Civilian Boat Without Lights...Collision During Crossing</p>
<p>A Yangtze River steamer of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company collided with a civilian boat near Wuhu, causing the boat to sink and five deaths. The Maritime Administration has been notified yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Collision Circumstances: The Jiangtian steamer was loading important cargo in Nanjing to enter Anhui. At 4:25 AM on the 24th of this month, when the ship arrived two miles upstream of Digang near Wuhu, a civilian boat was carrying passengers and goods from Liujadu to Yaojiagou. The civilian boat did not have lights and attempted to cross the river in front of the Jiangtian steamer. In the darkness, the Jiangtian steamer saw it too late to retreat and struck the civilian boat, causing it to sink immediately into the river, and all the passengers fell into the water.</p>
<p>▲ Five Drowned: After the small civilian boat sank, the captain of the Jiangtian, Qin Youyu, learned of this and ordered the ship to stop immediately and sent the entire crew to rescue the people who fell into the water. As a result, the boat was already broken and sank without a trace. Only two children, aged seventeen and fifteen, claiming to be surnamed Zha, the civilian boat was owned by their father, their father had fallen into the water, and four other men and women, including Yang Laosan, were also drowned. The boat was transporting reed mats from Liujadu to Yaojiagou. Since the bodies of the drowned could not be salvaged, the Jiangtian steamer sailed to Liujadu.</p>
<p>▲ Two Children Rescued: The Jiangtian steamer sent the two rescued children to Liujadu and handed them over to Wharf Director Sha Jingqing, who sent the two children to their family. It was determined that the incident was caused by the civilian boat without lights and the rough waters causing the collision. Captain Qin requested He Guangge, who was on the boat, to be a witness and prepared a letter to the local Public Security Bureau to indicate the issue of responsibility.</p>
<p>▲ Reporting to the Maritime Bureau: The captain of the Jiangtian steamer telegraphed the details of the incident to Shanghai yesterday, stating that the accident was caused by the civilian boat without lights and the rough waters in the dark causing the collision. The sunken boat and the five bodies of the drowned have not yet been salvaged. The officers on duty at the time of the incident were Jiang Chen Xiliang and Second Mate Liu Jianxing. Upon receiving the report, the head office forwarded the case to the Maritime Administration with the captain's original letter attached. The procedure for handling the case is still undecided.</p>
<h3>Ye Lishao Sues Xu Jiping for Bigamy and Fraud</h3>
<p>The Son's Date of Birth</p>
<p>Causes Laughter Among the Audience</p>
<p>The Judge Hopes for a Reconciliation</p>
<p>To Avoid Creating Materials for Newspapers</p>
<p>A complicated and bizarre love triangle case involving one woman and two husbands was continued in the fourth courtroom of the First Special District Court yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, presided over by Judge Fu Lin. Ye Lishao filed a criminal suit against Xu Jiping (also known as Xu Zhongxi) for fraud, bigamy, and obtaining property by deception. Both parties arrived in court with their respective lawyers. Judge Fu first asked the names of the plaintiff and defendant, and then said to the defendant Xu Jiping, "The plaintiff accuses you of (1) bigamy and (2) fraud. We are now checking whether the witness, lawyer Yang Changchi, has arrived in court." Chinese Police Officer No. 2591 reported that he had been summoned to Yang's office on Route Lafayette in the French Concession, but Yang was not there, and his clerk signed on his behalf. Then, the lawyer for the plaintiff, Ye Lishao, stated, "The firm of lawyer Yang is still on Jiangxi Road in the British Concession. The divorce agreement between Xu and Ye was actually signed in that lawyer's office. Therefore, the court has jurisdiction over the portion of the lawsuit involving fraud." The defendant's lawyer then retorted, "Whether the divorce agreement was signed in Yang's office or Yang's residence should be determined by Yang's testimony in court." Judge Fu declared that a lawyer's professional duties should be based on their office in principle, just as a judge's duties are based on working in the yamen [government office]. Now that the defendant has arrived in court, the phrase "location" has been determined.</p>
<p>Should Proceed with the Trial: The defendant was then asked about his age, and he replied that he was 25 years old. The plaintiff's lawyer immediately stated that the defendant was actually 28 years old and demanded that the defendant state his age truthfully. At that time, Xu asked to summon Yang Changchi to testify, saying that he had indeed signed the agreement at Yang's house in the French Concession. Judge Fu then reinterpreted the legal provisions on jurisdiction, and he remained silent. He then continued to testify that he had married Ye Lishao on March 20, 1928, and the witnesses were Cai Yaozhong and Ye Tongshu. The judge then asked Ye about the time of the marriage. According to Ye, she married Xu on March 20, 1927, at the Cangzhou Hotel in Hangzhou.</p>
<p>After the Marriage, She Returned to Fengjing: Her native place, and lived together for a month, then accompanied Xu to her mother's house, where they lived for about a year. During this period, she went to Hankou to do business, and the defendant went to Shanghai from time to time. She only knew that he came to Shanghai to study, and at first did not know that he had developed a relationship with Hu Bingheng. Before she and Xu were married, she had a son in January 1927. Later, when she returned home from Hankou, the son was gone. Xu said that the son had died. When asked where the body was, he said that it had been cremated.</p>
<p>As for His Marriage to Hu: According to his confession in the civil court, he divorced her in 1926. The reason on the surface was that he disliked that her house was small and did not want to live together. Lawyer Yang repeatedly sent letters to negotiate, and then a divorce agreement was signed, giving her 1,000 yuan in alimony. In addition, he paid 200 yuan for Duan'er's upbringing. Now she knows that Duan'er was not born to her, so she is suing him for fraud, totaling 1,200 yuan. Duan'er was born on May 5, 1928.</p>
<p>When Xu Jiping Heard This: He stated that Duan'er was born on May 25, 1929, and that the plaintiff deliberately made a mistake in the date of marriage, so everything was wrong. The audience and the lawyers of both parties could not help but laugh. Judge Fu also felt that this case was of little value and instructed the lawyers of both parties to go outside and persuade the parties to reconcile, saying that otherwise, the endless litigation would only create materials for the newspapers and cause both to lose their reputations, which would be extremely pointless. His words were heartfelt, and many who heard them were moved. The court then continued to hear Xu Jiping's testimony. He said that he married Hu in 1926 and Ye in 1928. The latter was according to his parents' wishes, while the former was a free love. Judge Fu then instructed him, "When you married Ye, it was a time of absolute liberation for the women's movement. You were a young student, how could you still follow your parents' wishes?" Xu replied, "There is still a reason for this. Ye's mother and my mother were old friends. In 1925, Ye's mother asked my mother to marry me to her daughter. My mother agreed. In the spring of that year, I met Hu at a classmate's house. In the autumn, I met her again on the Shanghai-Hangzhou train. At that time, I was still studying in Jiaxing. We began to exchange letters. The following spring, Hu proposed to me, but I insisted on monogamy, and Hu also agreed. On March 28, Hu came to the South Station and invited me to a hotel, and then we got married." He also vehemently denied Ye's claim that Xu had a son before they were married. At this point, both lawyers stated that there were some issues in this case that needed to be resolved after the civil case between Xu and Hu was decided. Therefore, they unanimously requested a postponement. However, the plaintiff's lawyer stated that Xu Jiping did not have a fixed residence and demanded that he be ordered to post bail. After considering this, Judge Fu decided to entrust the defendant to his lawyer, who would vouch that he would appear in court next time when summoned. He then agreed to postpone the hearing and still earnestly advised them to go outside and reconcile.</p>
<h3>Taxpayers' Association Opposes Telephone Rate Hike</h3>
<p>Another Letter to the Municipal Council Hoping to See a Reply Soon</p>
<p>Changes to the General Regulations Must Be Translated into Chinese and Published</p>
<p>The Shanghai Concession Taxpayers' Association sent another letter to the Public Concession Municipal Council yesterday regarding the opposition to the telephone rate hike: We are writing to inform you that we have received a letter from the Shanghai Special District Telephone Users' Association, which states that the Shanghai Telephone Company, under the pretext of changing new machines, vaguely requested the Municipal Council's approval to increase prices and to retroactively calculate from March. This kind of behavior is only to seek its monopoly interests and does not consider the decline of commerce after the war and the exhaustion of the social economy. This kind of behavior clearly violates the spirit of public undertakings. Reading the newspaper again, it was learned that the general regulations have been changed in secret, without announcement, only instructing users to go and consult them, which seems to lack respect for the interests of users. Our association was established by user organizations to jointly seek the legal interests of users and promote public improvement. In addition to writing to the company to negotiate for exemption from the price increase, we also write to you in response, hoping that your council will stand on the position of protecting the interests of Chinese taxpayers and strive for reason, in order to achieve the purpose of reducing the burden on users, and we also ask you to forward to the Municipal Council, instructing the company to continue to charge at the old price temporarily until this case is resolved, and all general regulations must also be translated into Chinese and published in order to ensure fairness. We sincerely hope that this will be the case. The telephone price increase, our association has repeatedly sent letters to your bureau stating our claims on record, and we now respectfully request your bureau to check the various letters, and quickly handle them and see a reply.</p>
<h3>Various Unions Support the Civil Movement Committee's Telegram Regarding the Electric Power Issue</h3>
<p>Regarding the dispute at the Sanyou Factory, after the Central People's Movement Guidance Committee issued a telegram regarding the electric power issue, requesting the municipal government to use extraordinary measures to force the factory to reopen, it has aroused repercussions from various domestic goods factories and the China General Confederation of Industry, who have telegraphed the central government one after another, requesting that the order be withdrawn. At the same time, various labor unions have expressed their support, requesting strict enforcement. The Shanghai General Labor Union also issued a public announcement yesterday regarding this matter, and the Cotton Weaving Industry Union of the Seventh District also issued a declaration. Excerpts are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲General Labor Union's Announcement to All Sectors It is hoped that people from all walks of life will take note: The Sanyou Industrial Co., Ltd. General Factory stopped work after the January 28th Incident. After the war ended and Shanghai was stabilized, all the workers, feeling deeply the pain of prolonged work stoppage, repeatedly appealed to the factory to resume work as soon as possible to maintain their livelihoods, but they were not granted permission. After repeated mediation by party and government organs, the capitalists repeatedly refused to attend, causing delays, and ultimately resulting in the tragic event of some workers being forced to go on a hunger strike. However, the capitalists remained unmoved, their cruelty being truly outrageous. As a result, public sentiment was indignant and public opinion was in an uproar. The Central People's Movement Committee, seeing that the capitalists were so stubborn and cunning, willing to let the workers starve to death without showing pity, intending to create a social terror situation, in order to prevent unfortunate events from occurring and to save the dying workers, issued a telegram regarding the electric power issue, requesting the municipal government to use extraordinary measures to handle this extremely urgent event. If this continues to be delayed, it will cause major social disturbances. Apart from using revolutionary measures to seek a solution, what other methods are there? It is regrettable that this still failed to awaken the conscience of the factory and cause them to suddenly realize their error. Instead, they have united with various factories, ignoring reason and justice, talking endlessly about laws, and publishing large-scale advertisements in major newspapers, creating a major public relations campaign, which has aroused resentment between labor and capital throughout the city. The association feels deeply regretful about this. However, looking at the advertisement, it talks about the law constantly. It should be known that the law is inseparable from human sentiment. Therefore, we will now state the "human sentiment" in this dispute. It is found that when the Sanyou Factory was first established in the early years of the Republic of China, the capital was only six hundred yuan. Later, due to the good management of the capitalists and the hard work of the workers, production efficiency increased, and the products became increasingly refined, which were happily purchased and used by the Chinese people. The company's business was able to develop gradually, and the annual profit was in the tens of thousands. Therefore, the capital was expanded year by year. Today, the Sanyou Company has become the only domestic goods factory in our country. This is due to the blood and sweat of all the workers in the past, which has made no small contribution. Now, due to the impact of the war, both labor and capital have suffered losses. However, the capitalists have earned a substantial profit over the years. Even after the changes, they still live in tall buildings and eat delicious food, living a comfortable life, while the workers rely on their ten fingers for food and clothing. Once the factory is closed and there is no work, what will happen to their lives? During this long period of work stoppage, everything has been pawned. The pain they endure is difficult to describe. If the capitalists have a conscience, how should they show consideration and pity for the thousands of workers who have worked hard for many years? They should find ways to provide relief, but they have not made any inquiries. Even when they starve and beg, they are unmoved. Is this fair in terms of reason and justice? Moreover, although the factory suffered an incident this time, the losses were not significant. The Hangzhou factory has been greatly expanded, and the store on Nanjing Road is also operating as usual. It is difficult to justify the excuse of being unable to resume work. Furthermore, regarding this dispute, the workers initially demanded that all work be resumed, but now they have retreated to restoring part of the work and expressed their understanding of the capitalists' difficulties, and are willing to voluntarily reduce their wages to assist in the development of the capitalists' business, hoping that the dispute can be resolved peacefully as soon as possible. Their pursuit was ineffective, and they did not resort to violent destructive methods, but to passive hunger strikes, their sincerity and purity of action were rare in past labor disputes. However, the capitalists have always insisted on their own views, with no room for maneuver. Although various parties have persuaded them with reason, they have not sincerely accepted, resulting in the dispute being prolonged and unresolved. To whom does the responsibility lie? It is very clear. The facts are all there, and all sectors of society can see it. There is no need for the association to elaborate. However, it is our duty to not remain silent, so we dare to state the above in order to seek a fair judgment.</p>
<p>▲Declaration of the Cotton Weaving Industry Union of the Seventh District The Cotton Weaving Industry Union of the Seventh District, in response to the declaration advertisement published by the China General Confederation of Industry, etc., opposing the Central Committee's telegram, issued a special declaration stating that the temporary suspension of work at the Sanyou General Factory was due to avoiding danger. Since it was not approved in accordance with the law at the time, it should be resumed as soon as possible. The workers' hunger strike to seek work is a most legitimate measure. We should express our sympathy from a humanitarian standpoint. The factory suffered very little loss during the Shanghai war, and has accumulated huge profits over the years. Moreover, the dismantling and transportation of the general factory's machinery to Hangzhou for expansion, completely disregards the livelihoods of the old workers. Therefore, the Central Party Department's People's Movement Guidance Committee's telegram is in line with the party's position. Now, the China General Confederation of Industry, etc., are citing the clauses of absolute private rights of business freedom, regardless of whether their reasons are sufficient, their trend of jointly suppressing labor is conceivable. If class struggle is unfortunately triggered, the responsibility will naturally lie with them. Our association has always maintained a spirit of cooperation to seek the development of industry and commerce. It is absolutely inappropriate to shake the stability of the entire society with the interests of one party or one class. If the country has a large amount of land, but farmers are not allowed to cultivate it, and it is left barren in order to raise its rent, should the party and government intervene at that time? I hope everyone can calmly seek the livelihood of the entire nation, and stop killing each other and creating opportunities for enemies to invade and deceive us. I wonder what the wise capitalists think?</p>
<h3>Municipal Health Bureau Requests Municipal Government to Commend Tianyuan Electrochemical Plant</h3>
<p>Wu Yunchu, Municipal Government Commendation</p>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau has reported that the Tianyuan Electrochemical Plant donated dozens of boxes of bleaching powder last year when the city handled the accommodation of disaster refugees. This year, when the Japanese army invaded Shanghai, the areas where they were stationed were extremely dirty and urgently needed disinfection to prevent epidemics. When the bureau implemented disinfection, the factory donated another 30 boxes of boxed bleaching powder and 20,000 catties of scattered bleaching powder, totaling a value of more than 1,000 yuan. They have foresight, are eager to serve the public, and are enthusiastic about public health, which is highly commendable. According to regulations, they should be commended. The bureau has now cited the commendation regulations and submitted a request to the municipal government to consult the Ministry of Interior for approval of a commendation certificate. Wu Yunchu, the manager of the factory, has enthusiastically supported it and made great contributions. The municipal government is also requested to praise him.</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Brazilian Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Brazilian Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Government yesterday stating that the Brazilian Chamber of Commerce has now been established in this city and registered with the Brazilian Consulate. Mr. M. Dietrich has been selected as the chairman of the chamber. In the future, we would like to cooperate with your local chamber of commerce in various business matters. For various details regarding the business situation in our country and the operating conditions in China, please write to Mr. Dai at 38 Edward Road for inquiries. This letter is specifically for your attention. Sincerely, Wu, Mayor of Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Approves Exemption of One Month of Dongting Shipping Taxes</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government yesterday approved the request of Xing Zhigang, the representative of the Dongting Shipping Company, for the exemption of ship taxes for February and March of this year during the war period to show sympathy. The reply stated, "Received and noted. Approved to exempt one month of ship taxes for February, following the precedent of exempting lighter taxes in this city, to show sympathy. Those who have already paid will be refunded accordingly. Please inform and take note." After receiving the approval, the representative has already informed the shipowners that they must drive to the ship tax office of the Finance Bureau at Dongjiadu Wharf to verify and stamp their documents to complete the formalities.</p>

<h3>Explanation Meeting on the Photographic Printing of the Song Dynasty Edition of the Buddhist Canon</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Photographic Printing Society of the Song Dynasty Edition of the Buddhist Canon sent a letter to various libraries and Buddhist groups throughout the country yesterday, stating, "Respectfully informing you that the Song Dynasty Edition of the Buddhist Canon has long been treasured at home and abroad. However, what is generally seen in records is only scattered volumes and individual books, which already indicates its special value. If one seeks the complete collection, which is vast and consists of thousands of volumes, it is truly a rare occurrence nowadays. Since the discovery of the Song Dynasty edition of the Buddhist Canon in Xi'an, our association has spent considerable time and effort compiling and collecting it. Every difference in the printing block, every slight damage to a single word or stroke has been carefully corrected and completed. This edition was published during the reign of Emperor Lizong of the Song Dynasty and completed during the reign of Emperor Wuzong of the Yuan Dynasty. It was created by the Yan Sheng Yuan of Qisha in Pingjiang Prefecture, totaling 1,522 kinds of sutras, vinaya, and treatises, with more than 6,300 volumes. At that time, Pingjiang, which is now Wu County, visited ancient temples in Jianghuai extensively, and this scripture has long been lost. Only Shaanxi Province still has an isolated copy. Colleagues are worried about the devastation caused by the chaos of war and the difficulty of cultural protection. Therefore, we are implementing a plan to photographically print and circulate it. We have previously sent photography technicians to Xi'an to select and produce a large number of glass plates for taking pictures, transported them to Shanghai, and will soon start selling pre-orders. The initial edition is planned to print 500 copies. All the detailed measures will be published in the newspapers at that time. Our association first states the intention of actively publishing this edition, because this scripture is a finely printed edition of the Song Dynasty and a huge legacy in world culture, not just related to one country or one religion and time. Benevolent people should have a deep understanding of this. As for the beauty of the original block printing and the rarity of errors and deletions, there is no need to repeat them. It is truly a responsibility that the people should bear to contribute to preservation. Therefore, since we started this project, we have been extremely quick in compiling the scriptures, extremely careful in photographing the blocks, and extremely low in pricing. The Beijing Qing Dynasty edition requires 5,000 yuan per copy, but this is only about one-tenth of that. This is different from commercial profiteering. Shanghai newspapers have repeatedly recorded this. We believe that you are always enthusiastic about circulating the Dharma treasures and promoting culture. We respectfully ask for your full support in promoting and ordering them. We are extremely grateful. We send our best wishes for the autumn season."</p>
<h3>Yuangmingyuan Road Will Pilot One-Way Traffic</h3>
<p>Jiangxi Road Bridge Closed to Traffic for Ten Days</p>
<p>The Public Works Department has now decided to pilot one-way traffic from south to north on Yuangmingyuan Road (between Beijing Road and Suzhou Road) starting from September 5th, with a trial period of three months, from 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM daily, except for Sundays and holidays. After the trial, if it is not considered satisfactory, it may be changed to north to south and trialed for another three months. The implementation of this measure is due to the recent heavy traffic congestion on Yuangmingyuan Road, where vehicles often cannot pass each other and must reverse a certain distance to proceed. The parking of vehicles on the west side of the road is a customary right that has been passed down for ten years. If it is canceled, it will cause much inconvenience. In 1930, one-way traffic from south to north was trialed. The opinion of the police department is that this direction is more suitable than north to south, but it may also be worthwhile to give the latter a trial opportunity to prove its advantages. In addition, the Jiangxi Road Bridge will be closed to traffic for ten days starting from August 30th due to urgent repairs.</p>

<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests Sponsorship for the Committee for Encouraging the Use of Domestic Goods</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Shanghai Federation of Domestic Goods Factories yesterday, requesting support for the Committee for Encouraging the Use of Domestic Goods, stating that in recent years, foreign goods have flooded the market and domestic goods have fallen behind. The situation is getting worse. It is necessary to intensify efforts and actively promote domestic goods to save the situation and awaken the public. Since the Republic of China advocated the promotion of domestic goods more than ten years ago, those who spoke earnestly were ignored, and no real effect was seen. The reason for this is not that the Chinese people lack the enthusiasm for patriotism, but because there are no concrete measures. As it stands now, if no further measures are taken, the future of domestic goods will be hopeless. The Chamber has specially submitted a request to the two municipal party and government organs to jointly organize a committee to encourage the use of domestic goods, ordering all departments and bureaus to comply with the use of domestic goods, and using reward and punishment methods to achieve natural effects. It is not difficult to extend this from one district of Shanghai to the whole country. The future of domestic goods is promising. This is a major matter, and it is easy to achieve with everyone's support. Please support and sponsor this effort to achieve practical results.</p>

<h3>Record of the Interrogation of Kidnappers in the Qian Miaofu Case</h3>
<p>Published in the Newspaper with One Yuan Counted as One Hundred Yuan</p>
<p>The Kidnappers Initially Demanded 100,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Qian Guanjin, a local resident of Huayuan Garden, No. 7, Lane 606, Poon Tse Chi Road, French Concession, had some real estate, which aroused the covetousness of bandits. At 8:20 PM on the 20th of last month, his seven-year-old son Miaofu was cooling off in front of the door when four kidnappers suddenly came and kidnapped Miaofu, hiding him in a small boat in Alan Village, Huazhong Township, and demanding a huge ransom for his release. The victim received ten letters from the kidnappers, ordering him to paste notes and publish advertisements to negotiate the ransom price, and arranging meeting places. The negotiation was not successful. On the 13th of this month, Jin Jiulin, special officer of the French Concession Police Department, and detectives Zhang Ziying, Li Yaolong, and Bao Tan Qin Youyu arrested the kidnappers Wei Youwen in Pingji Li Road, and then arrested his accomplices Wang Shaoqing and Xu Dashunzi (all from Jiangbei) in Hongkou Tao Peng Road, and rescued the hostage. Wei and the other three were sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation and investigation. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, Wang Gangxu, the chief of the criminal court, sat in the first criminal court for interrogation. Fei Xizhen, the police lawyer, first stated the case, accusing them of kidnapping and extortion under Article 371 of the Criminal Code. Qin Youyu, the detective in charge, reported the process of solving the case, arresting the defendants, and rescuing the hostage. Then, the victim Qian Guanjin brought his son Miaofu to testify about the kidnapping, stating that after the child was kidnapped, he received letters from the kidnappers every other day, a total of ten letters. They first demanded 50,000 yuan, then reduced it to 30,000 yuan, instructing him to write a note stating the number of 300 yuan and leave it at the entrance of the Yuanshangli Lane, Tiandong Zilaihuo Street, counting one yuan as one hundred yuan, requiring 30,000 yuan. Later, they instructed me to publish an advertisement, still counting one yuan as one hundred yuan to negotiate the price. I first published an advertisement offering 5 yuan, as if agreeing to offer 500 yuan, and later increased it to 30 yuan, willing to offer 3,000 yuan, but it was still not negotiated. Finally, they asked me to go to Huasheng Road and Jiangwan Road to negotiate, instructing me to carry an umbrella with a white towel on it as a signal. Because I was timid, I did not go. Later, the police detective sent someone to negotiate on my behalf, but it was still not successful, etc. He also submitted the letters and newspapers as evidence. Wei Youwen testified that he was 32 years old, lived on Xie Xu Road, and worked as a vegetable seller. Yang San, who is at large, came up with the idea. He came to my house at 10:00 AM on July 4th to discuss it, instructing me to invite people. I went with Yang to Wang Shaoqing's place to explain the kidnapping, and Wang also went to Xu Dashunzi's place to discuss it, and asked him to invite people. It was decided to meet at the Jinshuitai Tea House on the 14th. When I went to see Yang, Wang, Xu, and those invited by Xu, Chen Caigao, Li Xiangyuan, Xu Xiaorzi, Chen Dajizi, Zhang Xiaokunzi, etc. were already there. They agreed to do it on the evening of the 20th. On the appointed day, I did not go to participate in the kidnapping because of something else, etc. Wang Shaoqing testified that he was 27 years old and worked as a rickshaw puller. The previous statement was the same as Wei's statement, but he stated that he did not go because he was sick. On the 21st, Xu Dashunzi told me that the child had been kidnapped and hidden on a boat in Fahua. After that, I did not know anything about the negotiation, etc. Xu Dashunzi testified that he was 17 years old. Yang San, who is at large, and Wei Youwen and Wang Shaoqing, who are in custody, came to my place and instructed me to invite people. I recommended Chen Caigao, and then Chen invited Zhang Xiaokunzi, Li Xiangyuan, Xu Xiaorzi, Chen Dajizi, etc., who are at large. At 6:00 PM on the afternoon of the 20th, they gathered at Jinshuitai. At 8:00 PM that night, they set off and arrived at the Qian's house. Chen Caigao and Zhang Xiaokunzi each held a handgun and led the others who were at large inside to kidnap the child. Xu Xiaorzi and I took a rickshaw and fled. I was watching the wind outside. Wei and Wang did not go at the time. The next morning, Chen Caigao told me that the child was placed on a boat in Fahua. I told Wang Shaoqing. Afterwards, Chen Caigao was the only one who advocated writing letters and negotiating prices. I did not know anything. On the morning of August 11th, Chen Caigao and Zhang Xiaokunzi asked me to go to Wang Shaoqing's place. It was said that at 11:00 AM that day, they contacted the victim at the corner of Huasheng Road and Jiangwan Road. Later, Chen gave me a showerhead pistol and Zhang Xiaokunzi also held a handgun and went to negotiate, but it did not work out and they dispersed. The court verified the confessions and ordered that the interrogation be continued at 9:00 AM on September 8th. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Concubine Sues Wife and Aunt After Husband's Death</h3>
<p>Demanding 30,000 Yuan in Alimony</p>
<p>Fang Wenxue, who lived at 252 Chongqing Road, worked at the Jianghai Customs and had a good monthly income. His wife, Ms. Wang, lived with her husband, but Fang took Chen Shaqin, a woman from Suzhou, as his concubine five years ago, and lived separately at No. 1, Weishan Lane, Kai Zier Road, French Concession. Ms. Chen is now 29 years old. Since living with Fang, she has had no children. In February of this year, Fang Wenxue died of illness. Chen Shaqin, believing that his wife Fang Wang and aunt Fang Zhu did not care for her, hired lawyer Cai Liucheng to file a lawsuit in the First Special District Court, requesting mediation. As a result of the failed mediation, she formally sued Ms. Wang and Ms. Zhu. The petition stated that the plaintiff married Fang Wenxue, the husband of the defendant Fang Wang, as a concubine five years ago, and they had a close relationship. She initially lived at No. 1, Weishan Lane, and later lived with her husband in the old house on Chongqing Road, meeting his aunt Fang Zhu and family members. Later, Fang unfortunately fell ill, and the plaintiff took care of his medicine and did her best. However, her husband eventually died in February of this year. The plaintiff, alone, lost her support and felt that the wife, Fang Wang, was violent and threatened to deal with her with crude means. The plaintiff was worried about her future life, so she had repeatedly discussed with her husband's family members, believing that her husband's family had hundreds of thousands of dollars. The plaintiff was a member of the defendant's family and was also in charge of Fang Wenxue's estate. Therefore, she should be given a considerable amount of property or cash. At that time, Ms. Fang Zhu and her husband's family members all expressed their acceptance, but said that they would continue to talk about it after the funeral. However, Ms. Fang Wang took advantage of the funeral to take away the plaintiff's savings passbook and government bonds, refusing to return them. She also repeatedly delayed the alimony matter. The plaintiff had no choice but to request mediation from your court, but it failed. Therefore, she filed a lawsuit, requesting that the defendants be jointly and severally liable to pay the plaintiff 30,000 yuan in alimony. Yesterday morning, Judge Li Hu opened the eighth civil court for trial. The defendants did not appear and hired lawyer Lu Dingkui as their agent. Chen Shaqin, the plaintiff, was asked to testify, explaining the past situation and submitting a list of the defendant's property and land that she had investigated, saying that there were 5,000 yuan in unified tax government bonds, which her husband bought and gave to her, and a passbook with 2,500 yuan, which was deposited in the Xiangji Western Bookstore on Sichuan Road opened by her husband's younger brother, which had now been taken away by Fang Wang. She added that her parents were dead and she had no relatives to rely on and her life was difficult. Therefore, she requested 30,000 yuan in alimony. Judge Li then asked Chen Shaqin why she did not live with the wife. Chen replied that the wife was fierce and she could not live with her. He asked how much she needed to spend each month. She replied that she needed more than 200 yuan, including 20 yuan for rent, 5 yuan for a maid, 60 yuan for vegetables and rice, and several hundred yuan for buying clothes each year. Judge Li calculated that this would only cost more than 100 yuan per month. Now she was asking for 30,000 yuan, which would yield 240 yuan in interest per month at 8%, which was more than half of her budget. Therefore, she could only ask for 15,000 yuan. At this point, the defendant's agent, lawyer Lu, stood up and stated that Fang Wenxue had a total of six brothers living together and had not separated their families. The eldest was Wenxue, and the third brother had already passed away. Although the land submitted by the plaintiff to the court did exist, most of it had been rented out to others. Therefore, her statement that the defendant had hundreds of thousands of dollars in family property was not true. Moreover, the land was inherited from their ancestors and the brothers had not separated their families, so it was not solely owned by Wenxue. Judge Li stated that Fang Wang had not arrived, so the case could not proceed. He ordered that Fang Wang be summoned to court for further interrogation on the morning of September 6th.</p>
<h3>Lu Qingxiang's Concubine Sues for Abandonment, Hoping for Alimony</h3>
<p>Lu Qingxiang, the owner of the Qianhe Coal Store in Old Church, Xinzha Road Bridge, is quite wealthy. In addition to his wife, he took Ms. Bao, a woman from Pinghu, as his concubine on August 20th of the Republic of China. At that time, she was still young and did not know what it was like to be a minor wife. It was not until after the marriage that she realized the truth. However, the mistake had already been made, and she was still favored by Lu and his parents, so they lived in peace without complaint. However, Lu liked women and felt that one wife and one concubine were still not enough to satisfy his desires. He took a second concubine, and from then on, he abandoned the old for the new, ridiculing and scolding Ms. Bao. He gradually disliked her. He moved the newly married Jiang to the store and neglected Ms. Bao. Occasionally, when he returned home, they would always quarrel. Recently, he even denied Jiang, saying that they were living together and could separate freely. Ms. Bao tasted the meaning of his words, realizing that he wanted to abandon her halfway. She was afraid that she would be abandoned and would be old (she is now 33 years old), and she wondered how she would support herself. Therefore, she hired lawyer Zhang Deqin to file a petition in the First Special District Court, stating the circumstances of her marriage to Lu as a concubine, and stating that all the evidence would be presented at the trial. Since the concubine was a member of the family, all living expenses should be borne by the defendant. This is stipulated by law. Now the defendant is abandoning the plaintiff, so the fault lies entirely with the defendant. In order to protect her livelihood, she had no choice but to ask the defendant to pay alimony, calculated from the age of 33 this year until the age of 60, based on living expenses of 16 yuan per month, totaling 28 years, requiring 5,000 yuan. It was investigated that the defendant owns a large family property of 200,000 yuan. The plaintiff, having been abandoned by him, only requests 5,000 yuan in alimony. In terms of all the defendant's property, this is only requesting one-fortieth of it as a capital to live on for the rest of her life. In terms of reason and justice, it is not harsh. In addition, the plaintiff had private savings of 500 yuan, which the defendant took away on the pretext of lending it to his friend, and has not returned the principal or interest to this day. Therefore, she requested a judgment to (1) allow the plaintiff to break away from the defendant, (2) repay the loan of 500 yuan and interest, (3) pay the plaintiff 5,000 yuan in alimony, and declare provisional execution, and (4) all litigation costs in this case should be borne by the defendant. Yesterday morning, Judge Yang opened a court session, summoned both parties to question the facts, and then the lawyers on both sides debated to the end. The official ordered them to wait for a scheduled judgment.</p>
<h3>Cylinder Burst, Injuring Three People</h3>
<p>Car Instantly Shattered</p>
<p>Lu Taochang, a native of Tongzhou, 44 years old, drove a car to the Jiaotong Rubber Company at No. 641 North Henan Road and Baoshan Road yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, asking them to repair the car tires. Before Lu could park the car and get out, the cylinder suddenly burst and the car body was instantly shattered. At the same time, Lu's back was severely injured and bleeding profusely. Xu Afang, a colleague of the Jiaotong Rubber Company, was caught in the explosion and also injured in the chest. Ms. Xu, the owner of the tea shop next door, was watching from inside the counter and was also injured in the head by the explosion, suffering the most serious injuries. After the accident, the injured were sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment by the Huishi Police Department's No. 112 Chinese patrol car. However, Ms. Xu's injury was particularly dangerous, so she was transferred to Guangren Hospital, and her life could not be guaranteed.</p>
<h3>Shops Fined for Not Affixing Stamp Duty to Receipts</h3>

<p>Planning to Establish China Film Co., Ltd.</p>
<p>Wen Zongyao, Guo Shun, and other prominent figures from the political, academic, and business circles of the city, recognizing the importance of developing the Chinese film industry and promoting social education, have initiated the organization of China Film Co., Ltd. The company is capitalized at one million yuan, to be paid in full at once. A founders' meeting was held yesterday at 7:00 PM at the Gongdelin restaurant. More than 20 people attended, including Wen Zongyao, Shi Liangcai, Zhang Boxuan, Jiang Daduo, Zhao Danti, Guo Shun, Liu Zhanen, Chen Fengyuan, Zhang Xi, Ge Gongzhen, Li Zushen, Zhang Xingyan, Li Denghui, Tao Jiayao, Mai Zuoheng, Wang Xiaoying, Li Dachao, and Chen Bin. There was a detailed discussion on the reasons for the establishment, the company's articles of association, and the share prospectus. It was also decided to set up a preparatory office at Room 112, 2nd Floor, East Asia Bank, Sichuan Road, and to simultaneously prepare for the establishment of a film training school to train outstanding talents. Stock subscription will commence as soon as approval from the Social Affairs Bureau is obtained.</p>
<p>Expansion of Xie Jin Primary and Secondary School</p>
<p>Xie Jin Primary and Secondary School on Yuyuan Road, West Shanghai, has been established for five years. Ms. Huang Yiru, the principal of the school, has worked diligently and spared no effort. She is particularly serious about the teaching aspect, which has led to the school's growing reputation and a rapid increase in the number of students. However, the school buildings are not very spacious, and the students are extremely crowded every time school starts. There is often a problem of full enrollment, so those who want to enter the school often regret not being able to get a place. Therefore, new houses have been rented at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Hede Road near the school for use as a second school building.</p>
<p>Emergency Executive and Supervisory Committee Meeting of Sauce Industry Employees</p>
<p>Since the management of the sauce industry in the city undermined the established agreement and organized a conditions maintenance association, the employees have repeatedly negotiated with the management, but to no avail. The labor side has been unable to achieve a peaceful resolution. As a last resort, the emergency joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees decided to intensify the work of various departments and order the organization of two propaganda departments. Staff members have been selected and dispatched to various districts starting yesterday to convene group meetings. The city is divided into six Liu districts, with shops as units, and it is scheduled to convene a joint meeting of the heads and deputy heads of each district within a week. If the management still does not offer a satisfactory response when the meeting is convened, the possibility of a strike will be discussed.</p>
<p>The National Goods Traveling Promotion Group Entertains National Goods Manufacturers</p>
<p>The National Goods Traveling Promotion Group at Xiaoximenkou entertained various national goods manufacturers and companies the night before last to view their pre-departure appearance. More than 30 companies, including Jiufu Company, Xu Chongdao Yuehao, French-Chinese Pharmacy, Yixin, Dafu, and Huaxing, attended, totaling about 300 people. The meeting was called to order at 7:00 PM with the ringing of a bell. First, the initiators Wang Longchao and Xu Qiaoqi delivered speeches, advocating the importance of promoting national goods as a strategy for economic salvation. This was followed by a report on the difficult process of organizing and the work plan for the departure of the traveling film crew. Sun Choucheng, a representative of the National Goods Factory Association, also spoke, expressing his indignation at the current national crisis. Subsequently, advertisements entrusted by various companies were shown, with Director Xu providing thoughtful explanations, revealing the idea that "using national goods is saving the country." Someone also sang national goods folk songs, which were quite moving. The screening of the film about the 19th Route Army's resistance against Japan followed. The event ended at 10:00 PM. Several manufacturers successively entrusted the group with advertisements.</p>
<p>Water Pipe Merchants Provide Convenience to Fire Brigades</p>
<p>Installation of Fire Hydrants Requires Prior Reporting</p>
<p>Many stores and residents in Shanghai have installed underground fire hydrants for fire prevention. However, they do not inform the fire brigade in advance, which leads to the fire brigade members going to the scene after hearing the alarm, choosing distant water sources over nearby ones, often missing the opportunity to extinguish the fire effectively. The Shanghai South Fire Brigade Association, recognizing this issue, has requested the Municipal Public Works Bureau to instruct water pipe merchants to report to the association before installing fire hydrants and obtain a stamped certificate for coordination. The bureau believes that the reason is justified and will discuss unified measures with the Public Security Bureau. The Public Security Bureau will require the water pipe merchants installing the fire hydrants to directly report to the fire brigade in the district where the installation is taking place, and the fire brigade will send personnel to provide guidance. The fire brigade in the district will then report the installation details to the Public Security Bureau for record-keeping. It is reported that the Public Security Bureau has already issued a notice to all fire brigades. The Public Works Bureau has also notified the Zhabei Waterworks Companies in Mainland China to inquire whether the water pipe merchants have reported to the fire brigade and obtained a certificate before installing fire hydrants, otherwise, the water supply will be temporarily suspended.</p>

<p>Overseas Chinese Ship Large Quantity of Rubber Raw Materials</p>
<p>The Xingapore Cen Yeliang Rubber Factory, founded by overseas Chinese Cen Yeliang, is a large-scale factory that manufactures various rubber soles. It has entrusted the Shanghai Tiantong Road Yi Shengyuan Zhu Pi Hang, managed by the general manager, to sell its products to various provinces in the country for many years and has long been known in society. Mr. Cen, recognizing that there are more than a dozen rubber shoe factories in Shanghai, but because our country does not produce rubber trees, all the raw materials are purchased from abroad, and the profits are lost to foreign countries, which is a pity, specially shipped a large quantity of rubber sole raw materials from Xingapore to meet the needs of domestic manufacturers, aiming to resist foreign goods and offering special low prices.</p>
<p>Four Banks Issue Reserve Report</p>
<p>No. 139</p>
<p>The Four Banks Reserve, jointly established by the Yanye, Jincheng, Zhongnan, and Dalu Banks, is responsible for issuing banknotes of the Zhongnan Bank.

An announcement is made every week, which is checked by the auditors and accountants of the Four Banks. The 139th announcement of the Shanghai Reserve on August 27, 2020 is as follows: Amount of banknotes in circulation: 17,827,757 yuan Total amount of reserves: 17,827,757 yuan, including cash reserves of 10,986,876.87 yuan and guarantee reserves of 6,840,880.13 yuan.</p>

<p>Diplomatic Discussion on Collecting Foreign Banknote Tax Jiang Liqi</p>
<p>The issuance of banknotes by foreign banks in China has a long history, almost following each bank itself to supply local markets. At that time, Chinese people did not know the meaning of economic invasion, and even less did they know that foreign banknotes would affect China's finance. After the Boxer Rebellion, the psychology of belittling foreigners changed to fearing and trusting foreigners. Foreign banks took advantage of this weakness and issued more banknotes. The late Qing Dynasty and before the end of the European War was the heyday of foreign banknotes. In Shanghai, hard currency was mostly based on British silver dollars, and soft currency was mostly foreign banknotes in circulation. Even in the inland, foreign banknotes were widely used. An independent country must have its own specific monetary system, and the issuance of banknotes must be specially permitted by the state, which should not be interfered with by foreigners. However, at that time, hard currency was imported, and soft currency was mostly issued by foreign banks. Those who did not know the situation almost suspected whether they were still in Chinese territory. After the European War, the power of foreign banks was clearly exposed. The bankruptcy and suspension of payment of Sino-French, Daosheng, and German-Chinese banks gave the Chinese people a deep impression. Taking advantage of this opportunity, Chinese banks spared no effort in maintaining the credit of banknotes. With the rise of national consciousness, foreign banknotes gradually decreased and were replaced by Chinese banks. Today, foreign banknotes are rarely seen in the market. According to an estimate by Westerner G.E. Read in the Financial and Commercial Report, at the end of 1931, the total amount of foreign banknotes in circulation in Shanghai was only 3.98 million yuan. Although the accuracy cannot be guaranteed, it is indeed very different from the heyday of that year.</p>
<p>The issuance of banknotes should be specially permitted by the state and must be limited to domestic banks. This is the same in all countries in the world. The reason is needless to say. However, because of China's weakness, when foreign banks set up branches in China, they did not register with the Chinese government to obtain licenses, and even less did they obtain special permission from the Chinese government to issue banknotes. The government has never inquired about the amount of issuance or the reserve situation. Therefore, according to legal principles and previous Sino-foreign treaties, the Chinese government has never recognized the issuance of banknotes by foreign banks from the beginning, and it can be banned or revoked at any time. For example, when the National Government was in Guangdong, it prohibited the use of Hong Kong dollars in the market, and violators were severely punished. Foreign banks had no recourse and could not resist with the claim of previous recognition. The momentum of Hong Kong dollars was severely weakened. This is what we should pay special attention to.</p>
<p>Now, newspapers have published that the government plans to levy a banknote issuance tax, with a tax rate of 2.5% of the guarantee reserve, equivalent to 1% of the issuance amount. Chinese commercial banks, unable to bear the burden, have requested a postponement of the levy and a reduction of the tax rate, and have also requested equal treatment with foreign banks. The government has also solemnly promised that if the tax is levied, there will be no discrimination between Chinese and foreign banks. This author, in his humble opinion, cannot help but express his views. Whether the banknote tax should be levied, whether it can be levied, and whether the tax rate is reasonable and fair are not what this article intends to discuss. What I want to discuss now is whether the issuance of banknotes by foreign banks should be banned. If a ban is impossible, should it be given an informal special permission? After the special permission, will the future ban plan be affected? After consulting previous Sino-foreign treaties and correspondence, except for the treaty between Outer Mongolia and Russia regarding bank issuance, the right of foreign banks to issue banknotes has never been recognized. People can understand this only because of the country's accumulated weakness and the failure to negotiate revocation. If we now levy taxes on banks such as the Banque Sino-Belge, is this not equivalent to increasing their legal basis and clearly declaring that foreign banknotes have obtained the government's de facto special permission? When the situation changes in the future, or after the abolition of taels and the change to yuan, and the number of banknotes increases, foreign banknotes will inevitably take the opportunity to increase their issuance. At that time, even if the government wants to ban them, they will use tax payment as evidence of special permission. This action today will provide them with a guarantee for illegal rights and will be equivalent to recognizing improper gains. There is no better plan to avoid this. Therefore, I believe that if the government wants to levy a banknote tax, it should take this opportunity to negotiate the revocation of foreign banknotes and recover the lost rights. If revocation is not possible, it should follow the example of Guangdong and strictly prohibit their use, and violators should be punished. This is the best policy. If that is difficult to achieve, then inspect their issuance content and strictly supervise them, limiting them to the current amount of issuance and prohibiting further increases. However, a higher banknote tax than that levied on domestic banks should be imposed, and the right to increase the tax rate at any time should be reserved to show differentiation. This is a medium policy. If neither of the above two can be implemented, then temporarily postpone the matter and wait for future negotiations. For the time being, absolutely do not allow any legal basis for them to make excuses. This is the worst policy, but it is still better than being greedy for small, immediate gains and incurring great disasters and mistakes in the future. The national crisis is deepening, and the country is riddled with problems. It is hoped that the authorities will consider carefully and avoid giving others handles to use against us. It is like the three northeastern provinces, although they cannot be recovered immediately, the treaty to cede land will never be signed until death. My humble opinion is as such, and I hope that wise people in the country will correct me.</p>

<p>Free Talk Two-One Branch Tan, Ten-Zhang Light Line to Catch Honey Fish Zhan Lu</p>
<p>Sitting in the waterside pavilion of the West Garden, leaning on the railing and sipping tea, watching the three or five swimming fish, living in a glass kingdom, (this is not Glass-via), traveling together; inside here is thoroughly clear, casting a copper coin, one could see the copper coin landing, and there would be no concealment. Fish society is very bright, human society is more ashamed.</p>
<p>The tea guests next to me were talking about fish; some were talking about the five-colored fish of Yuquan, some were talking about the carp of the Yellow River, not just longing for fish while standing by the pond, but actually discussing fish while standing by the pond; among them, one guest spoke about the honey carp in the Siming Mountains, relishing it with great interest, worth recording a bit.</p>
<p>(Mencius gave up fish for bear paw, but what he spoke of was ordinary fish; if he had tasted the honey carp in the Siming Mountains; he would definitely give up the bear paw for the fish.)</p>
<p>Entering the Siming Mountains from Guangxi, about twenty-odd miles, there is a Honey Cliff, standing thousands of feet tall, overlooking a deep stream, this is the most elegant place with wind and shadow. Above the Honey Cliff, there used to be an incomparably large beehive, gathering millions of bees, which can probably be considered a first-class country in the bee world. When the honey is ripe, it drips into the stream drop by drop, resembling a few showers of sweet rain. The stream fish that eat this sweet water undergo a process of assimilation, and if the fish is made into sashimi, it is also sweet and without any foul taste; not only is the meat sweet, but it is sweet into the heart and liver; it is also like lovers in a love letter, worthy of being called sweet heart and liver. This kind of fish is not easily obtained, its name is Honey Carp; adding the word "gu" below the word "honey" means it is not only sweet, but also rich in feminine beauty, this is truly a treasure among fish.</p>
<p>Fishing for honey carp requires a cumbersome procedure; the fish are easily startled, and at the slightest touch of the hook, they leap desperately, often escaping. Moreover, the water below the Honey Cliff is clear to the bottom; if the fisherman uses a thick line, the fish sees the shadow of the line and swims away leisurely; if a light line is used, it is feared that it will not be strong enough to control the fish. Therefore, a light line of more than ten zhang is taken and wound around a bamboo pole. Upon reaching the stream, the line is slowly released. As soon as the fish is hooked, it is allowed to leap, with the pole and line loosened like flying a kite. When the fish that swallowed the hook is tired from leaping, the fisherman slowly reels in the line and obtains a honey carp of unparalleled sweetness.</p>
<p>Those sitting there, upon hearing this, all felt a sweet taste under their tongues, with saliva welling up.</p>
<p>Broken Hong Zero Goose Sends to Soldiers Shi Zi</p>
<p>Yesterday I went to visit my friend Hu Rixin. Hu is in charge of general affairs at a certain school. Previously, during the Shanghai Battle, the school was located in the war zone. The students were scattered. Hu joined the ambulance team. He spent seven weeks in the trenches. Among the corpses of enemy soldiers, he found dozens of letters and a diary. He asked someone who knew Japanese to translate them. He showed them to me. I quickly chose one or two to record below. Bones by the Wuding River, people in dreams in deep boudoirs. The warlords are greedy for war. Widowed wives. Orphaned children. It has always been the same at home and abroad.</p>
<p>(1) To my dear husband. The second letter from Shanghai has been received. The Chinese soldiers are so barbaric and strong, it is truly beyond expectations. You were slightly injured and are staying in a military hospital. It can be said that God is protecting you. I hope that the Chinese soldiers will retreat soon and that the Imperial Army will occupy the Chinese streets before you recover from your injuries, so that you will not have to go through terrifying battles again and can return triumphantly. The news of Fujiwara's death has not yet been known to his wife. However, she has not received a letter for two weeks, so his wife is extremely anxious. Fortunately, the news here is that the Imperial Army has repeatedly won victories in Shanghai. This is the consolation for the wife of the soldier. Our store has been taken care of by Yoshida (probably a shop assistant) since you left, and he has also been conscripted into the army, so no one is taking care of it. In addition, business is sluggish and taxes have increased, so it is impossible to maintain it. It closed yesterday. We will plan to resume business when you return triumphantly. Now I am sending a set of velvet rope shirt and trousers by mail. I hope you will wear it to keep warm. Attached are photos of your wife and beloved child (probably a daughter). I hope you will take good care of yourself and win glory for the Empire. Wife Chiyo. Dated February 23.</p>
<p>(2) To my son Yukio. You have not sent a single word since you were conscripted to Shanghai. It makes me very depressed. According to a letter from the Ozaki Miyamazo family, your brother died in Jilin on January 19 while suppressing bandits after being conscripted to Manchuria. His glorious death is admirable. Your younger brother became disabled while suppressing bandits in Kando. Of the three sons I gave birth to, you are now the only one I can hope for. (I don't know whether this old woman hopes for this son to die in battle or to return alive. But in the end, all three sons sacrificed for the country. This old woman is also very pitiful). I have been dazed and restless recently. If you can return and report your victory early, it will comfort me greatly. After receiving this letter, you must reply immediately to comfort me. I wish you all the best. Mother's writing. February 25.</p>
<p>Commemorative Medals of the 19th Route Army Huan Hua</p>
<p>In the January 28 Battle, the 19th Route Army fought bravely against Japan to defend national dignity and ethnic survival. At that time, the people praised the army for truly being the vanguard of the people, vowing to kill the enemy and breaking the selfish habits of soldiers in the past. Many people generously contributed their money to help the army; even students, exhausting their savings from frugal living, and laborers and peddlers, giving all their hard-earned money, all provided military supplies. This spirit of cooperation between the army and the people is enough to glimpse the people's ardent patriotism and the army's deep popularity.</p>
<p>Now, the army believes that the glorious war history of more than 30 days in the past also relied on the support of the people. In order to repay their righteousness, they specially made several commemorative medals and distributed them to compatriots who had donated money. The medals are made of iron and black, symbolizing the price of iron and blood paid by the army and the people. The top of the medal is a horizontal plaque, only an inch long and a fraction wide, cast with the six characters [Commemoration of the January 28th Resistance against Japan in Shanghai]. Below is a precious star, engraved with the words [Respectfully presented by Jiang Guangding, Cai Tingkai, and Dai Ji in the spring of the 21st year of the Republic of China]. Starting from the 25th of this month, they will be distributed to those who present their donation receipts from the past.</p>
<p>I secretly speculate that the army's intention in giving medals is not just for ordinary rewards. First, it allows those who are determined to endure hardship and avenge their humiliation to look at the object every day and remember their hatred, sharpening their determination to destroy Wu. Second, during this extraordinary national crisis, the army's spirit of sacrifice is a model for the people to resist insults. Third, the three provinces were lost overnight, but Shanghai was fortunate enough not to be lost like Zhao. Defending the country against the enemy relies on the unity of the people. Those who wear the medals should know what to strive for. As for encouraging those who do not have medals to love their country and feel ashamed of their indifference, that is a secondary matter. We should cherish this medal, understand its deep meaning, and carry it forward, and not take it lightly.</p>
<p>Autumn Wind Blows Away the Foreign Money Yimeng Zhonglou</p>
<p>Lost Hat Can Be Returned, But People's Hearts Cannot Be Measured</p>
<p>Although this is a very small matter, it may reflect a dark side of society. The fact is this:</p>
<p>Yesterday, I went to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to receive the commemorative medal presented by the 19th Route Army. When I passed the Tianhou Temple Bridge, a gust of wind suddenly blew my straw hat off the bridge. I rushed to the bridgehead and looked down. Fortunately, my hat landed on the bow of a large barge parked in the bridge arch and did not fall into the water. I was about to shout for someone to get the hat off the boat, but in the blink of an eye, my hat disappeared. I asked the people next to me, and they all said that the people on the barge had taken it. So I had no choice but to go down to the river myself and cross to the barge from a few small boats. There were four or five people on the boat. I asked them about my lost hat, but they all said in unison that they had not seen it. Two of them even said: [The hat has already fallen into the water.] At this time, I could only look at the river and sigh for my lost hat. Just as I was about to return to the shore, someone came up to me and volunteered to get the hat for me, but he wanted me to pay the price. This made me very suspicious: [Didn't the hat blow into the water? Are you going to get it from the Dragon King now?] But since he volunteered, I gave him two jiao. This person took the money and walked to the person who had just said that the hat had fallen into the water, mumbled for a while, and then my hat was taken out from under the deck. In the end, when the volunteer returned the hat to me, his condition was to pay another two jiao as a reward...</p>
<p>Although the lost hat was still put back on my head, I felt great pain in my heart. I was not heartbroken by the four jiao that was blown away by the autumn wind, but by the fact that people's hearts in society are so unpredictable!</p>
<p>Remembering Xiangzi Bridge in Chaozhou Han Fengsheng</p>
<p>Near Chaozhou, there is a stone bridge called Xiangzi. It spans the Han River, starting from the west of Zhupaimen and ending at Hanshan. The stones are more than ten feet long and two feet thick, laid flat on the dams. Three stones are arranged to form one crossing, about seven feet wide. There are twelve crossings in total, and boats can pass underneath. Now, half of it has collapsed. Legend has it that it was built by the banished immortal Han Xiangzi. Xiangzi was the nephew of Changli (Han Yu). He did not like to study but was good at magic. Changli was appointed as the governor of Chaozhou, and Xiangzi followed him. He often went into the mountains and rivers and did not return for several days. His uncle scolded him, but he did not listen. One night, there was a great storm. The riverbank seemed to be filled with shouts from ten thousand people. The whole city was struck by lightning. The young men who went to see what was happening fell to the ground when they stepped out of their houses. The next day, the bridge was completed. Xiangzi disappeared without a trace. This is one version. There is an iron ox at the head of the bridge, which is very large. Legend has it that there used to be two oxen, standing on the left and right sides. The one on the right often trampled on the rice and ate the wheat, causing the farmers great pain. They prayed to heaven, and the ox flew away. The one on the left was also deeply buried, with only its back exposed. This is the one that still exists today. Both versions are far-fetched and unbelievable. However, the construction is so strange that it could not have been done by human power. It is no wonder that heresy is rampant. I served in Chaozhou for four years. Every evening, I would take a boat to the bridge and look up at the huge stones, which were occupied by bees and ants. The jagged rocks were terrifying. Leaving the boat, I crossed the stone steps and climbed onto the bridge. Above the dam, the shade of the banyan trees covered the area. Hundreds of local people lived in the trees that they had carved out. Hanshan Academy was the place where Changli studied. In the Ming and Qing Dynasties, it was a local school. Now, it has been changed into a normal school. The sound of bells often came from the bridge, making people yearn for the past. Chaozhou produces citrus fruits that are the best in the country. During the winter and spring, people gather at the citrus market on Hanshan. Buyers cross the bridge to go there. Several sections of the bridge have been destroyed, and one must take a boat to reach it. Alas! Ancient relics are decaying and in danger, but no one discusses their restoration. Is it that the power of the people today is not as great as that of the people in the past? I have been a guest in Jiangnan for three years. This summer, I returned and visited the bridge with feelings. I am afraid that the bridge will be buried. Therefore, I wrote this record.</p>
<p>Nightly Sacrificial Offerings by Datong Music Society to Two Musicians (Part Two) Han</p>
<p>Abusing emotion, creating a love triangle, and making a big mistake. Bringing two beauties together to live in the same house. I am a commoner, just a humble scholar. My family has nothing, so how can I afford to build a golden house to store two beauties? Falsely claiming to be a golden husband, able to form a harmonious union. Alas, a clever woman finds it hard to cook without rice. My poor darling, willing to dream of sharing a bed. Sadly hating myself, not having yet received a doctoral degree. Mounting debts, baskets empty. Creditors knocking at the door, my poetic heart constantly breaking. The shadows of the two ladies, soon to be eating wind and drinking dew. Struggling in poverty, where can I turn for help? Thus, illness arises from poverty, and sorrow from extreme joy. The six senses are about to be cut off, seeking medicine in vain. Misfortune strikes twice, alas, illness has penetrated deep into the body. Thus, leaving the Huangpu, heading for Huangshan, hoping for the rain of Dharma and the merciful clouds, relying on them as protection against demons. But alas, the power of the Heavenly Venerable Buddha still cannot ward off the impermanence of death. Last month, newspapers reported that Ji Hong died of illness in a certain temple on Huangshan Mountain in Anhui Province. His situation after death was desolate beyond description. Alas, Ji Hong, is this his own fault? Or is this his fate? A mound of yellow earth, forever burying his earthly soul. A few points of green phosphorus, forever weeping for his homeless ghost. Who will sweep his grave in the years to come? Who will offer sacrifices on the winter solstice? Alas, like Ji Kang, unfortunately, Taiping has ended the lingering sound in the human world (referring to the song "The City is Full of Wind and Rain"). Yan Hui died young, and the second sage grieved over his short life. Alas, how sad! The grief over Ji Hong has not yet faded, and the bad news of Tianhua is pressing in again. Tianhua is a rising star from my hometown. His learning and artistry are both above Ji Hong. Moreover, he pays attention to phonology, intending to revive the Music Bureau, reviving the decline of vocal music for thousands of years. His ambition is almost unparalleled. Tianhua's father, named Baoshan, was my classmate in childhood and companion in examinations. His writing is not weak, but he lacks luck in examinations and remains a scholar all his life. Tianhua's brother, named Bannong, also named Xiashi, has been in Beihua for a long time, and his reputation is very high. A few days ago, someone told me that Tianhua died of a five-day illness in Beijing. I did not believe it. Until a few days ago, I saw the matter in the Free Talk section of the Shen Bao, and then I believed it was true. Alas, the talents of both sons are enough to pass on the mantle of music, and to serve as pillars of my art. The future is immeasurable. But I am old and have short hair, already in my twilight years. My rope is short and my well is deep, and I can no longer hope to see them soar. Therefore, since hearing of the deaths of the two sons, I have felt my mind spinning and my nerves in turmoil. I lament that this culture is about to die out. Who can I rely on? I sigh that sound education is in decline. When will it be revived? Even those with strong power are like this. What will the old and declining do? Alas, Ji Hong, of course, is no exception. But Tianhua, with his noble character, always cherished a heart of white jade, and strictly adhered to his principles, never falling from his soaring ambition. Even if he could not have a long life like Guoshi Gong, why would he not live as long as Zhong Qi? What is called heaven is unknowable, and the gods are truly difficult to understand. Alas, may your spirit find rest!</p>

<p>▲ Chaotic and Unpredictable Situation Yesterday's silver standard market was chaotic and unpredictable, with many twists and turns. The fluctuations were not small, with fluctuations of two or three liang at a time. There was a total difference of twelve liang throughout the day. There were more buyers than sellers in each exchange. Since the silver market performance continued to rise the day before yesterday, the market opened lower. Afterwards, the foreign exchange market loosened both openly and secretly, and banks consistently sold US dollars. Therefore, it broke through 690 liang in a worrying</p>
<h3>Thorough Investigation of Hand Grenade Casings</h3>
<p>For the Use of the 19th Route Army</p>
<p>Zhonghua Ironworks Has Provided Proof</p>
<p>Police Chief Zhang Yaodong of the Sanguantang Police Station in the Second District recently discovered Li Fengren, who was manufacturing bomb casings. Together with the evidence, he was taken to the station for investigation. After interrogation by Chief Zhang, Li Fengren confessed that he owned a sand casting factory. On July 9th, Zhonghua Ironworks ordered 30,000 hemp-tailed hand grenade casings from his factory. He had asked the factory if they had a manufacturing permit, and the factory owner said they did, and that they were intended as a gift for the 19th Route Army. Therefore, he entered into a contract with them to manufacture the casings and dared not do so privately. Chief Zhang, considering that the factory was entrusted to manufacture hand grenade casings, but the district had not received any orders and the factory did not possess any official permits, although Zhonghua Ironworks had provided a letter of proof, still saw the matter of manufacturing munitions as too important to ignore. He decided to transfer Li Fengren, along with two confiscated sample casings and the letter of proof, to the Third Section of the General Bureau for legal action.</p>
<h3>Barber Shop Employee Extorting Money Arrested</h3>
<p>Huang Hai, a Cantonese man working as an employee at the Yele Barber Shop on Xizang Road, colluded with the fugitive Huang Shengsun and Ouyang Hongkun on the evening of the 24th of this month at 11 PM, pretending to be detectives from the police station. They went to No. 478 Dexing Lane on Peng Road and told the Cantonese woman Xie Lu that her house contained opium, and they were there to search. They found an opium pipe under the bed, but nothing else. They said if she was taken to court, she would be fined 1,000 yuan and sentenced to six months in prison. If she didn't want to go, she could pay 1,000 yuan to settle the matter. If she didn't believe them, the Western detective was at the door. The woman was terrified and, having no such large sum of money, gave them two gold rings worth 80 yuan and an ivory cigarette holder. They arranged to negotiate the next afternoon. When Huang and the others returned, they reduced the extortion to 400 yuan. The woman repeatedly pleaded with them, and they set a date for the payment and left. Several days ago, Bao Tan Feng Qi of the Hongkou Police Station learned of this and arrested Huang Hai, detaining him in the police station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special District Court. The police lawyer stated that the defendant confessed in the police station that he was planning to smoke opium in a brothel in that lane when he met Huang and Ou, who asked him to enter and was detained. The defendant claimed that Ouyang Hongkun was a detective from the Public Security Bureau and instructed him to wait there. It was a case of mistaken arrest. Judge Shen reviewed the confession and ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody for further questioning at a later date.</p>
<h3>Head of Sixth District Branch Arrests Principal Offender in Robbery Case</h3>
<p>Bi Zhenhua, the head of the Sixth District Branch of the Shanghai West Municipal Public Security Bureau, recently received reports from the police chief of Hongqiao Town that the families of Shen Shaolian, Cheng Zhonglian, Yu Jiatang, and Yu Baoquan in Liujianong, had been robbed one after another. Finally, at the home of Zhang Jinxiang, a Taoist priest on Zhangjialang Road, although they were not robbed, the robbers dared to open fire on the police officers resisting arrest. Director Bi learned that the main criminals in the case, Fang Yousheng and others, were hiding in Qibao Town in western Shanghai. He immediately selected capable police officers Su Jinsheng, Wang Yucai, Chen Qinyu, Zhang Kuiwu, and four others, disguised themselves and waited. They arrested the three thieves, Li Yousheng, Yu Tiangen (also known as Wang Atian or Boss Tian), and Yu Amao. They also confessed that the handgun was given by Xu. Director Bi then dispatched the original group of police officers, wearing plain clothes, to wait at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Haig in the French Concession at about 8 PM on the evening before last (the 28th). Soon, they saw Xu riding a bicycle from south to north. The police officers bravely stepped forward and arrested him on the spot, sending him to the French Concession police station for temporary detention. Yesterday morning, Director Bi prepared a document and transferred him back to the Sixth District Branch for interrogation. It is said that he confessed that there were still many fugitives at large, and the police have been dispatched separately to strictly arrest them and bring them to justice.</p>
<h3>Patient Commits Suicide in Bathroom</h3>
<p>On August 2nd, Shen Jingzhi, a 34-year-old man from Hubei, checked himself into the Sacred Heart Hospital in Pudong for treatment of a foot ailment. It has been almost a month and he has not yet recovered, so he remained in the hospital for treatment. Sometime after 7 PM the day before yesterday, for some unknown reason, he went to the bathroom alone and suddenly hung himself from the window with his own belt. Later, Xu Jianhua, a shop owner at the hospital, went to the room to take a bath and saw Shen hanging from the window. Xu was shocked and ran to tell the hospital doctor. They took him down, but his limbs were cold and there was no way to save him. He soon died. The hospital immediately reported to the Yangshupu police station, who ordered detectives to investigate. The body was taken to the forensic center on Fielun Road. Yesterday morning, Zhan Liangce, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court, went to the center to examine the body and begin an official inquiry. After hearing Xu Jianhua's account of the situation, Zhan declared that the deceased male, Shen Jingzhi, had indeed committed suicide by hanging. Since there were no relatives to claim the body, the body was handed over to the Pushan Villa for burial.</p>
