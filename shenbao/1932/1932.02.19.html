<p>時評</p>
<h3>抵抗與同情彬</h3>
<p>處於今日强暴橫行公理不彰之世界。一民族而内不能團結外不能禦侮者。其民族必亡。吾人已於前評中略言之矣。蓋物競天擇。適者生存。從黑暗之棼園中爭取光明。從强暴之魔掌中奪取正義。必有此偉大英勇之奮鬥。斯乃能博得世人之同情亦惟有此種同情乃足以保證此種奮鬥。必能獲得最後之勝利也。</p>
<p>方去年九一八日軍强佔我東北東北。當局擁數十萬。大軍竟全師退却毫不抵抗。而東北軍人亦竟忘其衛國守土之天職。甘受個人之指揮。一退再退。坐視東北半壁河山。全淪敵手。當局旣如此其怯弱　頇。故斯時雖値國際聯盟集會伊始。而遂僅持冷眼旁觀之態度。一再作遷延敷衍之决議。蓋在此不抵抗之怪現象下。國際人士已視中國民族爲甘受日本之宰割。</p>
<p>及天津禍變再起。錦州失陷。靑島福州等地之擾亂接踵而起。種種暴行。絶對爲有血氣之民族所萬難忍受。而各地當局。終始持息事寗人之態度。甘心退讓。在此情形之下。我國民族固奄奄無生氣。而國際人士對於日人之暴行。則更忘其爲違背公理與正義者。故當此次上海禍變爆發之初。列强竟不顧慮其市塲。不預爲制止。在其心目中蓋早已預料我國軍隊必不抵抗。即抵抗亦不過如鹽澤所云四小時即可解决。故仍冷眼觀變。此蓋自九一八以來列强一貫之態度也。</p>
<p>斯時乃幸有我十九路軍英勇之將士。毅然肩承其衛國守土之天職。奮起抵抗。旬日以來。每戰必捷。彼耀武掦威目無世界之『東亞霸王。』平素爲國際人士所稱道者今在我十九路軍英勇抗爭之下。雖擁有海陸空之大軍。與最新式之利器。竟毫無所施其暴力。此種偉大之事實。蓋亦國際人士始願所未想到者也。</p>
<p>有此英勇之抗爭。夫然後國際人士之耳目。乃爲之一新。乃認爲中華民族尙未喪失其立國之精神。於是而國聯對日。乃發出嚴正之勸告。於是而國際輿論。除有特殊原因者外。亦頓時轉變。</p>
<p>就此可知惟有自助。以自力求生存者。乃能生存。亦乃能博得他人之同情。而此種同情之博得絶不能毫無代價。必以熱血換來。其尤重要之意義。更可證明勇於内爭怯於對外之政府。必爲人民所打倒。内不能團結外不能自衛禦侮渙散如沙之民族。亦必爲世界人士所共棄。終歸於滅亡此爲鐵律。毫無假借。故在此鐵律之下。我民族惟有奮起禦侮。乃能博得國際之同情。或且能引起日本大多數平民之興奮。我國人今後。其應知所以自處矣。</p>
<p>上海事件</p>
<h3>我國拒絶日人無理要求</h3>
<p>昨日和平談判决裂</p>
<p>日提出哀的美敦書</p>
<p>雙方軍隊準備大戰</p>
<p>吳淞閘北昨無劇戰</p>
<h3>日哀的美敦書昨晚九時送達我方包括六項無理要求</h3>
<p>自一月二十八日以來、日軍突然政擊閘北吳淞等處我十九路軍、爲盡守土之責任、起而謀正當自衛之抵抗、人人抱必死之心、奮勇應戰、轉戰經旬、敵竭全力迭次總攻、均遭慘敗、遂派遣數萬陸軍應援、連日積極備戰、重圖侵犯、茲以各方佈置已妥、遂於昨晚八時四十五分、以日本軍司令植田謙吉名義、向我十九路軍蔡軍長提出哀的美敦書、其内容、包括六項無理要求、同時並以日總領事村井倉松名義、致吳市長一份、措詞大致相同、茲將通牒原文、錄述如下、</p>
<p>日本司令植田謙吉致蔡軍長通牒、本職基於欲以和平友好之手段、達到任務之熱烈希望茲對於貴軍通告左開各件、一、貴軍應即從速中止戰鬥行爲於二月二十日午前七時以前、將現據之第一線撤退完了、於二月二十日午後五時以前、從黃浦江西岸、由租界西北端、連結曹家渡鎭、周家橋鎭、及蒲淞鎭之線起算、黃浦江東岸由連結爛泥渡、及張家橋鎭之線起算、各從租界境界綫、向北二十基羅米突之地域（包含獅子林砲台、）内撤退完了、且在該地域内撤去砲台及其他之軍事設施、並不新設之、</p>
<p>二、日本軍於貴軍開始撤退後、不行射擊轟炸、及追擊動作、但用飛機之偵、察不在此限、又貴軍撤退後、日本軍僅祇保持虹口附近之工部局道路地域、（包含虹口公園之周圍）</p>
<p>三、貴軍第一綫撤退完了後、日本軍爲確認其實行起見、派遣有護衛兵之調查員、於撤退地域、該項調查員携帶日本國旗、以資識别、</p>
<p>四、貴軍對在該撤退地域外、上海附近之日本人生命財產、應完全保護之、此項保證如不完全、日方當採適當之手段、</p>
<p>五、關於在上海附近（包含撤退區域）外國人之保護、容另商議、</p>
<p>六關於禁止排日運動、一月二十八日吳市長對於村井總領事之約諾、應嚴重實行、</p>
<p>關於此項當另由帝國之外務官憲、對貴國上海行政長官、有所交涉、</p>
<p>如以上各項不能實行時、日本軍將對貴軍、不得已採自由行動、其結果所生一切責任、應由貴軍負之、昭和七年、二月十八日午後九時、大日本帝國司令官植田謙吉、</p>
<p>第十九路軍蔡廷楷閣下、</p>
<h3>和議破裂經過日軍堅持無理要求我軍當即嚴辭拒絶</h3>
<p>英公使藍溥森斡旋之和平運動、今因日軍堅持無理要求、遂完全陷入絶境、中日兩軍、日内大戰、已成不可免之事實、其决裂經過如下、昨日上午九時、我淞滬警備司令部參謀長張襄、應英公使藍溥森之約、在英總領事官舍、與日軍參謀長田代·及日副領事白井、會晤磋商和平辦法、英藍使並未列席、日方態度强硬、威脅的要求我方將吳淞閘北軍隊撤退二十基羅米突、我方軍事當局、當以此次中日戰事、完全釁自彼開、我方爲酷愛和平起、見接納英使討論消弭戰事問題之請、乃彼反向我提出無理要求、業經嚴詞拒絶、雙方談判、遂告破裂、當時、日方並有提出哀的美頓書之口頭宣言、談判决裂後、顧維鈞即於下午三時、訪英公使談數小時之久、</p>
<h3>宋子文發表談話國民新聞</h3>
<p>社云、行政院副院長宋子文、昨夜發表談片、略謂、昨日、路透東京電稱、日方將致哀的美頓書於十九路軍、而蔣介石軍隊則不在其列等語、我八聞之、不勝憤怒、此係日方故意企圖在十九路軍與前屬蔣介石將軍統率之其他軍隊間、引起誤會、且使世界發生一種印象、以爲日人之侵略、僅與一孤軍作戰、實與日本向來政策欲將一切中日問題槪視作地方事件如佔據東三省及攻擊天津·靑島·南京·上海等皆欲稱之爲地方問題者、同出一轍、總之、日人此語、與日代表佐籘、一再在日内瓦聲稱、中國僅一地理名詞、同一侮辱我國、須知十九路軍爲國軍之一部份、受國軍各部隊與全國人民之贊助、其餉糈軍械、槪出自國民政府、而其守衛上海、亦係奉行國府明令、倘日軍竟實行其恫嚇、再事攻擊十九路軍、將見舊屬蔣介石將軍統率之其他軍隊莫不欣然、欲與十九路軍隊忠勇同志、携手效命疆塲也、</p>
<h3>大美晚報之紀載大美晚報</h3>
<p>云、今晨中日軍事會議之情形、雙方外交代表均未公布、中日總司令均未親臨、僅派副官代表出席、此外尙有譯員一人、聞中日代表仍表示願獲榮譽的和平、並聲明彼等僅依本國司令之命行事、司令則須請命於政府與國民、雙方對於彼此軍隊撤退之遠近一節意見仍難接近、實爲談判最大之阻力、日副官言、日軍之來滬、主旨在維持和平、並保護日僑之生命財產、中國之談判、員亦謂十九路軍及其友軍之作戰、專爲自衛起見、從未希圖追至租界、又吳淞砲台亦爲雙方爭論之問題、華軍當局願在兩軍問闢一不設軍備區域、而吳淞則决不能放棄、日代表稱日方所注重者亦爲吳淞華軍應退至不危害淞口航行之相當距離、若能如此、則日軍擬衛守目下之陣線、以待華軍退出之區域、有正當警察接防、然後退入公共租界周圍畫定之原來防線、華軍退出之區域、應由上海市政府及國民政府切實擔保永久治安、不特願意如此、且須能履行諾言、會議遂止於此、</p>
<h3>泰晤士報之紀載上海泰晤</h3>
<p>士報云、目下用和平方法解决滬局之努力　依然在進行之中、但本報得可靠消息、倘中國先撤兵後、日軍願退出張華浜閘北一帶撤回租界之説並非確訊、日軍在滬案切實解决以前、决意留駐現在地點、不肯撤退、因此目下在滬各公使對於停止敵對行動、和平解决之希望、據聞已有顯然之悲觀、美使詹森今（十八）明（十九日）即將乘艦回京、昨日美使與意代辦齊亞諾午餐、晚間又赴法使韋禮德之宴會、對於滬局、俱有非正式之討論、但内容如何、美使未有所表示云、</p>
<h3>閘北昨日戰况</h3>
<p>江灣砲戰旋即平息</p>
<p>寳興路等處小接觸</p>
<p>昨日閘北方面、上午並無戰事、中興路火、已爲警備司令部消防隊撲滅、我軍均在防綫内、嚴陣以待、日兵始終未有舉、動下午在江灣及寳興路兩方面、曾有小接觸、不久即爲我軍擊退、入晚、閘北方面又起砲聲、惟無前晨之密、間有槍聲、福生路北四川路一帶、今晨零四十分起、日軍每隔半分鐘開一大砲、至一時後尙未停、茲將各情列誌如次、</p>
<h3>襲江灣即敗退日兵連日積</h3>
<p>極準備大、舉但其内容、除將後援陸軍、向各路增防、補充實力、安設砲位、及在滬江大學附近建設飛機塲外並無特殊軍事行動、而我軍處之鎭靜、頓使日兵智窮技絀、昨日下午一時半左右、日兵派出新到陸軍二百餘人、至葉家花園南、面向跑馬廳我軍陣地偷進、彼等似欲偵察我軍防線、俾遇有機會、則即進攻、當由我軍哨兵傳報後方、派一小隊阻擊、戰約一小、時敵軍因恐我軍包抄、故且戰且退、至二時十分、槍聲已全息、聞結果敵死三人、傷十餘人、我方受輕傷者二人、由紅十字會救送後方醫院、</p>
<h3>寳興路小接觸下午三時許</h3>
<p>、寳興路處新近接防之日本陸軍、向我軍挑戰、我軍不理、日兵意爲有機可乘、乃圖進襲、我軍俟其接近、即用機槍掃射、雙方步槍同時發射、接觸約半小、時日兵不支後退、我軍未予追擊、槍聲乃息、同時天通庵路方面、下午六時左右、亦有同樣小接觸、旋即平息、其他各防線、並無動、靜惟日兵仍不時有小部份、到處騷擾、一經我軍還擊、即行退却窺其用意、似欲擾亂我軍哨線、但我軍處之泰然、毫不爲動云、</p>
<h3>日兵又施砲擊昨日下午一</h3>
<p>時、日兵圖襲江灣砲馬廳時、日兵砲隊、又用砲向江灣及閘北轟擊、但均未中的、經我軍迎頭還擊後、即稍殺、至六時後、砲聲重起、我軍亦還砲、惟未若前晨之密、至九時五十分左右、尙未息、</p>
<h3>日又運到飛機敵軍擬大舉</h3>
<p>進攻吳淞及閘北、故戰事利器、連日運輸到滬者頗多、除火藥及馬匹以及鐵甲車坦克車等外、并又運到陸用飛機六七架、昨晨九時至下午三時許、已有兩架、由楊樹浦碼頭用汽車運往軍工路飛機塲裝置以便應用、</p>
<h3>寳興坊被砲燬永興路宋公</h3>
<p>園路東首之寳興坊、前晚被日軍砲彈落下將該處東首新建房屋三弄、完全燒毁、所免僅西首之破屋耳、共計被焚三十餘幢之、多</p>
<h3>外國軍事家表示大陸報云</h3>
<p>、昨（十七）據本埠若干外國軍事觀察家表示、日軍似未必有在日内無條件或有條件退出閘北興張華浜之可能性、　日人今（十八）日似未必即將終止上海之軍事行動、蓋欲在戰塲上顯示其實力與勝利、以作武力之恫脅、日人欲用軍備爲威嚇、今方遇一足以判斷眞僞之試騐、唯有戰鬥始可表現比種久經暗通消息於全世界之恫嚇、惟日本雖派一戰時完全師團携新式利器來滬、並輔以大隊海軍、而外國軍事家仍信其尙不適宜於取攻勢、因中國軍隊刻方隊續增加、且正急遽準備新式戰壕以作堅守之計、日人雖以砲隊與步兵稱雄、第重砲不適宜於進攻即輕砲於取攻勢時、亦難顯威力、日軍進攻閘北必遇巷戰、重砲將等於無用、唯有在曠野交鋒時、其步兵始可得大砲掩護之助、至於守者、則在房屋叢杳地方、易於却敵、天然占有優勞、日軍總攻擊期、據外國軍事家意見、或將在星期六夜間、或星期一黎明以前開始、俾可有一星期之光陰、從容佈置其一師團之軍隊、但亦有二三軍事家揣其將較早開始大隊者、至此時日人預定作戰計劃、料將企圖在江灣一帶衝破中國軍隊防線、冀可進而包圍敵軍、留一缺口、使敵人可向西南方或租界方面退却、但若使敵人退入租界、其事至難、勢必堅抗到底、故日人計劃、將企圖壓迫中國軍隊向西南方退却云、</p>
<p>陳銘樞昨來滬前京滬衛戍司令長官陳銘樞氏於昨晨四時、由南京抵眞茹、聞陳氏此行、係到前方、向前綫作戰之第十九路軍士兵訓話、並偕同各長官、視察前方陣綫佈置一切、於午間並與各軍事長官、開軍事會議、决定今後抗日種種計畫、現已全部計畫就緖、經於昨夜專車返京、</p>
<h3>吳淞戰事沉寂</h3>
<p>敵軍備戰異常積極</p>
<p>雙方槍聲間續不斷</p>
<p>昨日吳淞戰事、仍極沉寂、雙方均在積極佈置期間、敵軍自昨日拂曉起迄深晚、沿薀藻浜至侯家木橋戰線、不時開放大砲或機關槍示威、各處互相呼應、我軍亦間有還擊、昨日軍工路一帶、敵軍用汽車十餘輛、終日運輸、異常忙碌、</p>
<p>前線步哨兵示威記者昨晤前線軍事長官、首先叩以昨日前線之戰事情形、據謂今日（十八日）前線各路、均無正式戰事發生、雖偶聞槍聲、亦係前線步哨兵示威而已、日來敵方軍事動作、似在積極準備、從事變更計畫、惟我方亦已充分佈置準備痛殲敵宼、嗣又笑謂記者曰、這幾日眞所謂山雨欲來風滿、樓繼記者又問、日來和平進行、師部方面亦有所聞否、據謂、中國處處和平、事事和平、固無所謂不和平、但日人始終恃强欺人、處處硬幹、又何從着手我平、故欲和、平須日人先有誠意、自動撤退其佔據在租界中之軍隊、然後方足以言和平、乃日方所提之和平條、件要求我方軍隊撤退、豈非悖謬已、極總之、中國軍隊駐防在中國領土、是其應有之主權、舉世莫得而非之、惟日本軍隊在公共租界中立區域、則理應撤退、並應羣起而攻之、是以日軍苟不撤兵以表示其誠意、恐和平進行、難有希望、</p>
<p>日人自謂不易攻大阪每日新聞云、我軍自攻擊吳淞以來、已届半月、敵軍（我軍以下同）死守防地、毫無進展、特自十二日起、我左翼部隊（日軍）開</p>
<p>始前進、而各處敵兵探哨、與我軍肉搏、距吳淞約二哩之一四、敵軍散伏河浜、激戰尤烈、我軍自三輪軍曹以下、死傷甚多、其後我軍用飛機偵察報告、敵以砲臺爲中心、布三道防線、一道防線、自黃浦江沿至吳淞江岸、該金家屯而至楊家柳齊、約長四里第二道防線、由吳淞鎭之北方直至正家屯舍家浜、綿亘一里半、第三道防線設在砲臺附近、各防線之堅固、眞出我意料之外云、</p>
<p>雙方準備大戰雙方軍事當局雖在進行和議談判、而對於攻戰之準、備仍不稍懈、平凉路公大紗廠日陸軍司令部、昨晨異常活動、日空軍將士、終日在滬江大學附近飛機塲從事裝配數日内由日運到之飛機、惟各陣綫均頗寂、靜吳淞方面僅張華浜車站西面有小接觸、以供美國狐狸電影公司攝取新聞影片、歷半小時之久未有死傷、江灣方面、昨晨有日軍沿軍工路絡繹前進、携有馬拖過山砲隊野戰軍用品、該處陣綫晨間僅偶有槍聲、閘北近數日來之寂靜、昨日侵晨爲北車站附近之來福槍與機關槍聲所破、</p>

<p>華盛頓日海軍陸戰隊兵士毆辱美副領事案、日當道雖向上海美總領事道歉、美國務卿史汀生仍不認此案業已結束、必俟日當道拘捕負責之陸戰隊依法懲治、始告了結、（十七日國民電）</p>

        <h1>1932.02.19</h1>
<h3>Resistance and Sympathy</h3>
<p>In today's world where violence is rampant and justice is obscured, a nation that cannot unite internally and resist external aggression is doomed. We have briefly mentioned this in our previous commentary. Indeed, in the struggle for survival of the fittest, one must strive for light from the darkness and seize justice from the grasp of tyranny. Only through such great and heroic struggles can a nation earn the sympathy of the world, and only such sympathy can guarantee the ultimate victory of these struggles.</p>
<p>Last year, on September 18th, the Japanese army forcibly occupied our Northeast. The authorities, with hundreds of thousands of troops, actually retreated without resistance, and the Northeastern soldiers even forgot their duty to defend the country and their land, obediently following individual commands, retreating again and again, and passively watching half of the Northeastern territory fall into enemy hands. Since the authorities were so cowardly and inept, even when the League of Nations convened its initial meeting, it merely adopted a cold and indifferent attitude, repeatedly making delaying and perfunctory resolutions. Under this strange phenomenon of non-resistance, international figures regarded the Chinese nation as willing to be slaughtered by Japan.</p>
<p>As the Tianjin incident and the fall of Jinzhou occurred again, and disturbances in Qingdao, Fuzhou, and other places followed one after another, the various atrocities were absolutely unbearable for any nation with spirit. However, the local authorities consistently adopted a policy of appeasement, willingly yielding ground. Under these circumstances, our nation was indeed languishing, and international figures forgot that the Japanese atrocities violated justice and righteousness. Therefore, at the beginning of the Shanghai incident, the powers disregarded their markets and failed to take preventive measures. In their minds, they had already anticipated that the Chinese army would not resist, or that even if they did, it would be resolved in four hours, as Yan Ze claimed. Thus, they continued to observe with indifference. This has been the consistent attitude of the powers since September 18th.</p>
<p>Fortunately, at this time, the brave soldiers of our 19th Route Army resolutely shouldered their duty to defend the country and the land, and rose up in resistance. For dozens of days, they won every battle. The "Eastern Asian overlord" who brandished its power and disregarded the world, and was usually praised by international figures, found that despite possessing a large army, navy, and air force, and the latest weapons, it could not exert its violence against the heroic resistance of our 19th Route Army. This great fact was something that international figures had never anticipated.</p>
<p>With this heroic resistance, the eyes and ears of international figures were refreshed. They recognized that the Chinese nation had not lost its spirit of national independence. As a result, the League of Nations issued stern warnings to Japan. Furthermore, international public opinion, except for those with special reasons, also shifted suddenly.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that only those who help themselves and seek survival through their own strength can survive and earn the sympathy of others. Gaining this kind of sympathy cannot be without cost; it must be bought with blood. More importantly, it proves that a government that is brave in internal strife but cowardly in external defense will be overthrown by the people. A nation that cannot unite internally and defend itself against external aggression, a nation as scattered as sand, will also be abandoned by the world and will eventually perish. This is an iron law, without exception. Therefore, under this iron law, our nation can only rise up to resist aggression in order to win international sympathy, or even arouse the excitement of the majority of ordinary people in Japan. The Chinese people should know how to conduct themselves in the future.</p>
<p>Shanghai Incident</p>
<h3>Our Country Rejects Japan's Unreasonable Demands</h3>
<p>Peace Negotiations Broke Down Yesterday</p>
<p>Japan Presented an Ultimatum</p>
<p>Both Armies Prepare for a Major Battle</p>
<p>No Fierce Fighting in Wusong and Zhabei Yesterday</p>
<h3>Japan's Ultimatum Delivered to Our Side at 9 PM Last Night, Including Six Unreasonable Demands</h3>
<p>Since January 28th, the Japanese army suddenly attacked Zhabei, Wusong, and other places. Our 19th Route Army, to fulfill its duty to defend the territory, rose up in rightful self-defense and resistance. Everyone embraced a determination to die and fought bravely. After dozens of days of fighting, the enemy exhausted all its strength and launched repeated general offensives, all of which ended in disastrous defeats. Subsequently, tens of thousands of ground troops were dispatched as reinforcements, and they have been actively preparing for war in recent days, plotting another invasion. Now that all preparations have been completed, the Japanese military commander, Ueda Kenkichi, issued an ultimatum to Cai, the commander of our 19th Route Army, at 8:45 PM last night. The content included six unreasonable demands. At the same time, the Japanese Consul General, Murai Kuramatsu, sent a letter to Mayor Wu, with roughly the same wording. The original text of the ultimatum is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Ultimatum from Japanese Commander Ueda Kenkichi to Commander Cai: Based on my ardent hope to achieve our mission through peaceful and friendly means, I hereby notify your army of the following: 1. Your army should immediately cease all combat operations and complete the withdrawal from the current frontline before 7:00 AM on February 20th. Before 5:00 PM on February 20th, your army should complete the withdrawal from the west bank of the Huangpu River, from the northwest end of the concession, connecting Caojiadu Town, Zhoujiaqiao Town, and Pusong Town, and from the east bank of the Huangpu River, connecting Lannidu and Zhangjiaqiao Town, to a distance of 20 kilometers north of the concession boundary line (including the Shizilin Fort). Furthermore, all fortifications and other military facilities should be removed within that area, and no new ones should be established.</p>
<p>2. After your army begins its withdrawal, the Japanese army will not conduct any shooting, bombing, or pursuit operations, except for reconnaissance by aircraft. Moreover, after your army withdraws, the Japanese army will only maintain the Shanghai Municipal Council road area near Hongkou (including the surrounding area of Hongkou Park).</p>
<p>3. After your army completes its frontline withdrawal, the Japanese army will dispatch investigators with escort troops to the withdrawal area to confirm its implementation. These investigators will carry the Japanese flag for identification.</p>
<p>4. Your army should fully protect the lives and property of Japanese people near Shanghai (outside the withdrawal area). If this guarantee is not complete, the Japanese side will take appropriate measures.</p>
<p>5. The protection of foreigners near Shanghai (including the withdrawal area) will be discussed separately.</p>
<p>6. Regarding the prohibition of anti-Japanese movements, the promise made by Mayor Wu to Consul General Murai on January 28th should be strictly implemented. This matter will be further discussed by the Imperial Foreign Affairs officials with your country's Shanghai administrative chief.</p>
<p>If the above items cannot be implemented, the Japanese army will be forced to take free action against your army. Your army will be responsible for all consequences arising therefrom. February 18th, Showa 7 (1932), 9:00 PM, Ueda Kenkichi, Commander of the Great Japanese Empire,</p>
<p>To His Excellency Cai Tingkai, Commander of the 19th Route Army,</p>
<h3>Breakdown of Peace Talks: Japanese Army Insists on Unreasonable Demands, Our Army Immediately and Sternly Rejects Them</h3>
<p>The peace efforts mediated by British Minister Lampson have completely reached a dead end due to the Japanese army's insistence on unreasonable demands. A major battle between the Chinese and Japanese armies within days has become an unavoidable reality. The details of the breakdown are as follows: At 9:00 AM yesterday, Zhang Xiang, Chief of Staff of our Songhu Garrison Headquarters, met with Japanese Chief of Staff Tashiro and Japanese Vice-Consul Shirai at the British Consulate General at the invitation of British Minister Lampson to discuss peace measures. British Minister Lampson was not present. The Japanese side adopted a tough stance, threateningly demanding that our troops in Wusong and Zhabei withdraw 20 kilometers. Our military authorities stated that since this Sino-Japanese war was entirely initiated by the Japanese side, we accepted the British Minister's request to discuss the elimination of the war out of a love for peace. However, they are instead making unreasonable demands on us, which have been sternly rejected. The negotiations between the two sides have thus broken down. At that time, the Japanese side also made a verbal declaration of an ultimatum. After the breakdown of negotiations, Gu Weijun visited the British Minister in the afternoon for several hours.</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Issues Statement</h3>
<p>According to the National News Agency, Song Ziwen, Deputy President of the Executive Yuan, issued a statement last night, saying: "Yesterday, Reuters Tokyo reported that the Japanese side would send an ultimatum to the 19th Route Army, but the troops of Chiang Kai-shek are not included," etc. I was greatly angered upon hearing this. This is a deliberate attempt by the Japanese side to create misunderstanding between the 19th Route Army and other troops formerly under the command of General Chiang Kai-shek, and to give the world the impression that the Japanese aggression is only fighting a lone army. This is consistent with Japan's consistent policy of treating all Sino-Japanese issues as local incidents, such as the occupation of the three northeastern provinces and the attacks on Tianjin, Qingdao, Nanjing, and Shanghai, all of which they want to call local issues. In short, this statement by the Japanese is the same as the insult to our country by the Japanese representative Sato, who repeatedly stated in Geneva that China is only a geographical term. It must be understood that the 19th Route Army is a part of the National Army, supported by all units of the National Army and the people of the whole country. Its salaries and military equipment are all from the National Government, and its defense of Shanghai is also in accordance with the clear orders of the National Government. If the Japanese army actually carries out its threats and attacks the 19th Route Army again, it will be seen that all other troops formerly under the command of General Chiang Kai-shek will gladly join hands with the loyal and brave comrades of the 19th Route Army to dedicate their lives to the battlefield.</p>
<h3>Excerpt from the "Great American Evening News"</h3>
<p>The "Great American Evening News" reported: "The details of this morning's Sino-Japanese military conference have not been announced by either side's diplomatic representatives. Neither the Chinese nor Japanese commanders-in-chief attended in person, only sending adjutants as representatives. In addition, there was one translator. It is heard that the Chinese and Japanese representatives still expressed their willingness to achieve an honorable peace and stated that they were only acting on the orders of their respective commanders, who in turn had to seek instructions from their governments and people. The two sides' opinions on the distance of each other's military withdrawal remained difficult to reconcile, which was the biggest obstacle to negotiations. The Japanese adjutant said that the main purpose of the Japanese army's arrival in Shanghai was to maintain peace and protect the lives and property of Japanese residents. The Chinese negotiator also said that the operations of the 19th Route Army and its allied forces were solely for self-defense and had never intended to pursue into the concession. The Wusong Fort was also a point of contention between the two sides. The Chinese military authorities were willing to establish a demilitarized zone between the two armies, but Wusong could not be abandoned. The Japanese representative claimed that the Japanese side's concern was also that the Chinese forces in Wusong should withdraw to a reasonable distance that would not endanger navigation in the Songkou. If this could be done, the Japanese army intended to defend its current lines until the Chinese forces withdrew from the area and were replaced by regular police, and then retreat into the original defense lines delineated around the public concession. The area from which the Chinese forces withdrew should be effectively guaranteed for permanent security by the Shanghai Municipal Government and the National Government, and not only be willing to do so, but also be able to fulfill its promises. The meeting then ended."</p>
<h3>Excerpt from "The Times"</h3>
<p>The "Shanghai Times" reported: "Efforts to resolve the Shanghai situation peacefully are still underway. However, this newspaper has reliable news that the statement that the Japanese army is willing to withdraw from Zhanghuabang and Zhabei back to the concession after China first withdraws its troops is not accurate. The Japanese army is determined to remain at its current location and will not withdraw until a practical solution to the Shanghai incident is reached. Therefore, it is said that the ministers in Shanghai are now visibly pessimistic about the hope of stopping hostilities and resolving the situation peacefully. American Minister Johnson will return to Beijing by ship today (18th) and tomorrow (19th). Yesterday, the American Minister had lunch with the Italian Charge d'Affaires Ciano, and in the evening, he attended a banquet hosted by the French Minister Wilden. There were informal discussions on the Shanghai situation, but the American Minister did not express anything about the content."</p>
<h3>Situation in Zhabei Yesterday</h3>
<p>Artillery Battles in Jiangwan Quickly Subsided</p>
<p>Minor Engagements in Baoxing Road and Other Places</p>
<p>There were no battles in Zhabei yesterday morning. The fire in Zhongxing Road has been extinguished by the fire brigade of the Garrison Headquarters. Our troops are all in their defense lines, waiting in strict array. The Japanese soldiers have not taken any action. In the afternoon, there were small engagements in Jiangwan and Baoxing Road, but they were quickly repelled by our troops. In the evening, artillery fire started again in Zhabei, but it was not as dense as in the previous morning. There were intermittent gunshots. In the area of Fusheng Road and North Sichuan Road, starting at 0:40 AM this morning, the Japanese army fired a large cannon every half minute, and it had not stopped as of 1:00 AM. The details are listed as follows:</p>
<h3>Retreat After Attacking Jiangwan: Japanese Soldiers Actively Preparing for a Major Offensive in Recent Days</h3>
<p>The content, in addition to increasing the defense of reinforcements in various ways, replenishing strength, installing artillery positions, and building an airport near Shanghai University, does not include any special military actions. Our army's calmness has stumped the Japanese soldiers. At around 1:30 PM yesterday, the Japanese soldiers sent more than 200 newly arrived soldiers to the south of Ye Family Garden, facing the racecourse, to steal into our army's position. They seemed to be trying to scout our army's defense line and then attack if they had a chance. After our sentry reported to the rear, a small team was sent to intercept them. After about an hour of fighting, the enemy retreated while fighting because they were afraid of being surrounded by our army. By 2:10 PM, the gunfire had completely subsided. It is said that the result was that three enemies were killed and more than ten were wounded. Two of our soldiers were slightly injured and were rescued by the Red Cross and sent to the rear hospital.</p>
<h3>Small Engagement in Baoxing Road</h3>
<p>At around 3:00 PM, the Japanese army recently stationed on Baoxing Road challenged our army. Our army ignored them. The Japanese soldiers thought they had an opportunity and tried to attack. Our army waited for them to approach and then swept them with machine guns. Rifles were fired by both sides at the same time. After about half an hour of engagement, the Japanese soldiers were unable to withstand and retreated. Our army did not pursue. The gunfire then ceased. At the same time, there was also a similar small engagement in Tiantong'an Road at around 6:00 PM in the afternoon, which quickly subsided. There was no movement in other defense lines. However, Japanese soldiers still occasionally came to harass in small groups. Once our army counterattacked, they retreated. It seemed that their intention was to disrupt our army's sentry lines, but our army remained calm and did not move.</p>
<h3>Japanese Soldiers Launch Artillery Attacks Again</h3>
<p>At 1:00 PM yesterday, when Japanese soldiers attempted to attack Jiangwan Artillery Racecourse, the Japanese artillery teams used artillery to bombard Jiangwan and Zhabei again, but none of them hit the target. After our army returned fire, the shelling subsided slightly. After 6:00 PM, the artillery fire resumed, and our army also returned fire, but it was not as dense as in the previous morning. The firing continued at around 9:50 PM.</p>
<h3>More Aircraft Arrive: Enemy Army Planning a Major Offensive in Wusong and Zhabei</h3>
<p>As a result, many war weapons have been transported to Shanghai in recent days. In addition to gunpowder, horses, armored vehicles, and tanks, six or seven land-based aircraft have also been transported to Shanghai. From 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM yesterday morning, two aircraft were transported from the Yangshupu Wharf to the Jūngōng Road airport by car for installation and application.</p>
<h3>Baoxingfang Destroyed by Artillery Fire</h3>
<p>Baoxingfang, located on the eastern end of Yongxing Road and Songyuan Road, was completely destroyed by Japanese artillery shells that landed there the night before. Only the dilapidated houses on the western end were spared. A total of more than 30 buildings were burned down.</p>
<h3>Foreign Military Experts Express Their Views</h3>
<p>According to the "Continental Daily News," several foreign military observers in this city stated yesterday (17th) that the Japanese army might not unconditionally or conditionally withdraw from Zhabei and Zhanghuabang. The Japanese people did not seem to be terminating their military operations in Shanghai today (18th), because they wanted to show their strength and victory on the battlefield as a military threat. The Japanese wanted to use military equipment as intimidation and were now facing a test to determine the truth. Only combat could express the kind of intimidation that had been secretly communicated to the world for a long time. Although Japan sent a complete wartime division with new weapons to Shanghai, and supplemented it with a large naval force, foreign military experts still believed that it was not suitable for taking the offensive, because the Chinese troops were continuing to increase and were rapidly preparing new trenches for a determined defense. The Japanese were famous for their artillery and infantry, but heavy artillery was not suitable for attacking, and even light artillery had difficulty displaying its power when taking the offensive. The Japanese army would inevitably encounter street fighting when attacking Zhabei. Heavy artillery would be useless. Only when fighting in the wilderness could its infantry get the help of artillery cover. As for the defenders, they are in a place with a lot of houses, which is easy to repel the enemy, and naturally has superior labor. According to the foreign military experts, the Japanese army's general offensive will begin on Saturday night or before dawn on Monday, so that they can have a week to calmly deploy the troops of their division. However, there are also two or three military experts who speculate that a large group of people will start earlier. At this time, the Japanese army's planned combat plan is expected to attempt to break through the Chinese army's defense line in the Jiangwan area, hoping to advance and surround the enemy, leaving a gap for the enemy to retreat to the southwest or the concession. However, if the enemy retreats into the concession, it will be very difficult and they will inevitably resist to the end. Therefore, the Japanese plan will attempt to force the Chinese army to retreat to the southwest.</p>
<p>Chen Mingshu Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<p>Chen Mingshu, the former commander of the Jinghu Garrison, arrived in Zhenru from Nanjing at 4:00 AM yesterday. It is heard that Chen's trip was to go to the front and give speeches to the soldiers of the 19th Route Army fighting on the front line, and to inspect all the frontline deployments with various commanders. He also held a military meeting with various military commanders at noon to decide on various anti-Japanese plans for the future. All the plans have now been finalized, and he returned to Beijing by special train last night.</p>
<h3>Silence in the Wusong Battle</h3>
<p>The Enemy Army is Actively Preparing for War</p>
<p>Intermittent Gunfire Continues on Both Sides</p>
<p>The battle in Wusong yesterday was extremely quiet. Both sides were in the process of active deployment. From dawn to late at night yesterday, the enemy army continuously opened fire with artillery or machine guns to demonstrate along the line from Yunzaobang to Houjia Muqiao, echoing each other in various places. Our army also occasionally counterattacked. The enemy army used more than a dozen trucks in the Jungong Road area all day long, which was very busy.</p>
<h3>Show of Force by Frontline Sentry Soldiers</h3>
<p>When reporters met with frontline military officers yesterday, they first asked about the battle situation on the front line yesterday. According to reports, there were no official battles on any of the front lines today (18th). Although gunshots were occasionally heard, they were just demonstrations by the frontline sentry soldiers. The enemy's military actions in recent days seem to be actively preparing and changing plans. However, our side has also made full deployments and preparations to fiercely eliminate the enemy. Afterwards, they smiled and said to the reporters, "These days are what is called 'the mountain rain is about to come, and the building is full of wind'." Then the reporter asked, "Have you heard anything about the peace process from the division headquarters in recent days?" According to reports, "China is peaceful everywhere and in everything, so there is no such thing as unpeaceful, but the Japanese have always relied on their power to bully others and always do things toughly, so how can we start peace?" Therefore, to be peaceful, the Japanese must first have sincerity and automatically withdraw their troops occupying the concession, and then it will be enough to talk about peace. However, the peace conditions proposed by the Japanese side require our army to withdraw, which is absurd in the extreme. In short, the Chinese army's garrison on Chinese territory is its inherent sovereign right, and no one in the world can deny it. However, the Japanese army in the neutral area of the public concession should withdraw, and the public should rise up and attack it. Therefore, if the Japanese army does not withdraw its troops to show its sincerity, I am afraid that the peace process will be difficult to hope for.</p>
<h3>Japanese Claim it is Not Easy to Attack Osaka</h3>
<p>According to the "Osaka Daily News," it has been half a month since our army attacked Wusong. The enemy army (the following refers to our army) has been defending its position and has made no progress. Especially since the 12th, our left-wing troops (the Japanese army) have begun to advance, and enemy soldiers and scouts in various places have engaged in hand-to-hand combat with our army. The enemy army is scattered along the riverbank about two miles away from Wusong, and the fierce fighting is especially intense. Many of our soldiers, including Sergeant Sanlun, have been killed and wounded. Afterwards, our army's aerial reconnaissance reported that the enemy had built three lines of defense with the fort as the center. The first line of defense extends from the Huangpu River to the Wusong River, from Jinjiatun to Yangjia Liucai, and is about four miles long. The second line of defense extends from the north of Wusong Town to Zhengjiatun Shejia Bang, spanning one and a half miles. The third line of defense is located near the fort. The strength of each line of defense is truly beyond our expectations.</p>
<h3>Both Sides Preparing for Major War</h3>
<p>While military authorities on both sides are conducting peace negotiations, preparations for offensive warfare are still not relaxed. The Japanese Army Headquarters at the Pingliang Road Gongda Yarn Factory was unusually active yesterday morning. Japanese air force soldiers have been assembling aircraft transported from Japan in recent days at the airport near Shanghai University all day long. However, all the front lines are quite quiet. There was only a small engagement on the west side of the Zhanghuabang Station in Wusong, which lasted for half an hour and was filmed by the American Fox Film Company for newsreels. There were no deaths or injuries. In Jiangwan, Japanese troops were seen marching along Jūngōng Road in the morning, carrying mountain artillery teams and field army supplies. There was only sporadic gunfire on that front line in the morning. The silence in Zhabei in recent days was broken by the sound of rifles and machine guns near the North Railway Station early yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>Customs Office Continues to Operate</h3>
<p>Since the enemy army attacked Yunzaobang, the Wusong Zhanghuabang Jianghai Customs River Department Office has been located in the right-wing line of the enemy army, and the surrounding area has been completely occupied by enemy soldiers. As a result, all the Chinese and foreign staff of the office had to be forced to withdraw from the fire line and were transported to Shanghai by a customs launch. However, the office is responsible for ship mooring and handling other important ship affairs, which is important. Therefore, the important Western staff, a few Chinese staff, and two servants of the office still risked taking the launch through gunfire every day to go to the office in Zhanghuabang. However, it is extremely difficult to work. It is now learned that the Customs Commissioner has negotiated with the Japanese military authorities, who have agreed to allow all Chinese and foreign staff of the office to go to the office. Therefore, at 8:00 AM yesterday, all the staff of the office, led by the Western staff, took a launch at the customs pier to Zhanghuabang to formally continue working. However, the staff of the office are not allowed to go beyond the wall of the office, otherwise they will be shot by Japanese soldiers. A launch is also moored in front of the office pier to prepare for a retreat in the event of an emergency. In addition, a small number of Chinese and foreign staff of the nearby Junpu Bureau also remain in the bureau to work. However, at around 9:00 AM yesterday morning, two Chinese servants were arrested by Japanese soldiers for standing in front of the bureau and watching. Although the Westerners seriously negotiated with the Japanese military headquarters, the Japanese army accused the servants of being spies of our army and have not yet released them.</p>
<h3>Hotel's Elderly Owner Escapes Danger</h3>
<p>The "Great American Evening News" reported that Captain Davis, the 84-year-old owner of the Wusong Fort Hotel, had been living in the war zone since the Japanese warship bombed the Wusong Fort on February 3rd. He finally abandoned his home of decades and came to Shanghai yesterday. This was because Bosuto and Phillips of the Information Office of the International Settlement first obtained the consent of the Chinese and Japanese armies to stop the bombardment at a certain time in order to rescue Davis from danger. Yesterday, the two men chartered a launch to go to the Fort Hotel to find Davis, but Davis still insisted on not leaving. After the two men persuaded him repeatedly, and even wanted to force him away, Davis reluctantly packed his luggage and boarded the ship with the two men and came to Shanghai, also bringing his beloved dog. Davis had several cats, which he loved very much, but they had run away at that time and could not be found everywhere, so he abandoned them in the war zone, which Davis felt was a pity.</p>
<h3>Bombing Sound on Sichuan Road</h3>
<p>Chinese Telegrams Continue to Be Sent and Received as Usual</p>
<p>Police Attach Importance to Investigating the Truth</p>
<p>At around 7:45 AM yesterday morning, a bomb suddenly exploded on the Sichuan Road side of the Chinese Telegraph Bureau at No. 6, the corner of Sichuan Road and Fuzhou Road, under the testing room on the second floor. A hole was blown in the corner of the wall, and the glass windows on the three floors of the row of buildings along Sichuan Road were shattered. At that time, one passerby was injured on the road, but the machines and circuits inside the Bureau's newsroom were undamaged, and telegrams were sent and received as usual. The details of the bombing are as follows:</p>
<h3>Shock Felt Far and Wide: Chinese Telegraph Bureau Bombed</h3>
<p>The bombing of the Chinese Telegraph Bureau occurred at around 7:50 AM yesterday morning. At that time, there were only a few staff and workers in the Bureau. Suddenly, there was a loud noise, the building shook, and fragments of glass and tiles flew all over the ground. After investigation, it was learned that the noise was caused by a bomb explosion. The glass in the offices along Sichuan Road was shattered, and the equipment and sundries were also damaged. A hole was blown in the corner of the wall under the testing room on the second floor. The newsroom is next to the testing room. Observing the situation of the bomb's explosion, it seems that the intention was to bomb the newsroom and the testing room, but the bombing was unsuccessful.</p>
<h3>A Passerby Injured When a Bomb Exploded</h3>
<p>In the early morning, when there were few pedestrians on the road, Ren Shouji was passing by when he was caught in the explosion. He suffered injuries to his head, waist, and legs and was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. Ren is 64 years old and works at the Lido Hotel on Ningbo Road. Guo Youlan, an elevator operator at Renji Road No. 35, was walking on the sidewalk opposite the Telegraph Bureau when the bomb exploded. His whole body was jolted into the air but he was not injured.</p>
<h3>Damage to the Bureau: The Bomb Exploded Outside the Wall</h3>
<p>Because the explosion occurred outside the wall, the machines and circuits inside the bureau were not damaged. However, almost all of the large, thick glass windows along the street were shattered. The doors and glass of the Mitsui &amp; Co., a Japanese firm across the street, and the glass windows of the Wiener &amp; Co. on the second floor of the southwest corner of Fuzhou Road were also shattered. The streets on Sichuan Road were littered with shards of glass.</p>
<h3>Normal Operations: The Bureau Was Undamaged Inside</h3>
<p>Yesterday, telegraphs were still being received and sent as usual, and the staff worked as normal. The notice posted outside the door read as follows: "Our bureau's machines and circuits are undamaged, and telegraphs are being received and sent as usual. Shanghai Telegraph Bureau, February 18th."</p>
<h3>Police Investigation: The Purpose of the Bombing of the Chinese Telegraph Bureau</h3>
<p>The police are investigating and studying the purpose of the bombing, what kind of bomb was used, how it was thrown, and what the truth is. However, according to general speculation, it must have been thrown from a high place with the intention of bombing the bureau's important operations room and testing laboratory. Another report claimed that the bomb landed directly on the lower corner of the testing laboratory on the second floor, suggesting it was thrown from across the street. Still another report suggested it was placed on a window sill in advance. None of this has been confirmed yet. After the incident, the police dispatched detectives to investigate and collected iron fragments. It is said that the bomb was very powerful.</p>
<h3>Opposition to Making Peace with Japan</h3>
<p>The National Federation of Commerce Proposes Three Points</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce telegraphed the National Government yesterday, addressed to the Executive Yuan of the National Government in Luoyang, the Military Affairs Commission, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Military Affairs in Nanjing, and the Shanghai Municipal Government: "Since January, when the brutal Japanese attacked Zhabei without cause, our 19th Route Army has resisted fiercely for two weeks, repeatedly defeating powerful enemies. Our government has also resolutely moved the capital and issued repeated circular telegrams to plan a long-term resistance. Our people are offering incense and prayers, united in their hatred of the enemy. The League of Nations is also showing a weak and perfunctory attitude, rather than a firm one. Recently, it issued a separate telegram to Japan calling for a ceasefire. Our country should resist to the end to completely resolve all outstanding issues between China and Japan. However, we have gradually heard of proposals to withdraw troops and make peace. If this happens, the desperate battles of the past twenty days and the sacrifice of countless properties will have been in vain. The front lines are constantly reporting victories, while the rear is making peaceful concessions. We hope that our officials will not do this. However, as the news spreads, we cannot remain silent. We hereby send this telegram to your government, executive yuan, council, and ministries for your consideration and verification. You must insist on the following three points: (1) Negotiations and mediation will not begin until Japanese troops have completely withdrawn outside the Wusongkou. (2) Shanghai is not a local issue and cannot be resolved separately. (3) We oppose the establishment of a neutral zone. The above three points are our minimum requirements. If they cannot be achieved, we would rather be shattered like jade than preserved like tile. We must resist to the end and not submit." Lin Kanghou and others, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China, seal.</p>
<p>French Concession</p>
<h3>The Authorities State Their Position</h3>
<p>The French Consul General States That He Will Strictly Maintain Neutrality</p>
<p>The Chinese Director Advisor Gives a Responsible Speech</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Incident occurred, the French Concession authorities have solemnly declared that any armed personnel of any nationality carrying weapons into the French Concession must immediately disarm before being allowed to pass. However, there have been many rumors lately. The Chinese Ratepayers Association of the French Concession has specially appointed Zhang Xiaolin and Du Yuesheng to visit the French Consul General, Mr. Gange, again. Mr. Gange told them that France's attitude is to strictly maintain neutrality. He also hoped that they would convey this to the residents within the French Concession who are still unclear about the truth, and urge them to remain calm. Recently, the Chinese Ratepayers Association has repeatedly received letters from various parties asking whether the French Concession authorities have allowed Japanese soldiers to pass through, causing unrest among the residents. Chinese Directors Zhang Xiaolin and Du Yuesheng gave the following statement to reporters: "The French Concession authorities have stated that they will strictly maintain neutrality. The number of residents in the French Concession has recently increased by more than one million, and the security and order are particularly important. The French police have been stepping up patrols day and night to prevent incidents. We have also sent more than a thousand special agents to help maintain order. We are confident that nothing will happen within the French Concession. If anyone is found to have crossed the border, we will not only absolutely not allow them to pass, but also our special agents will perform their duties to fulfill the duty of Chinese citizens."</p>
<p>Recently, there have been many rumors circulating about the French Concession. Huang Jinrong, advisor to the French police, specially visited French Consul General Fevrier to discuss ways to eliminate these rumors. Consul General Fevrier said that the French authorities have already stated their neutral stance and that the rumors have no impact and are not worth taking seriously. He also asked Mr. Huang to tell the residents within the Concession to rest assured and not to worry themselves. Mr. Huang then told reporters that there have been many rumors circulating inside and outside the Concession recently, but the French authorities have already stated their position, and that these unfounded rumors are only causing panic. He has served in the French Concession police for many years and is confident that the French police have the ability to maintain order. With the unfortunate outbreak of war in Shanghai this time, the French authorities will strictly maintain neutrality and no accidents will occur. He and Zhang Xiaolin and Du Yuesheng have jointly dispatched a large number of special agents to assist the French police in paying attention to local order, and it can be guaranteed that nothing unfortunate will happen within the French Concession.</p>
<p>Peace and Quiet in the French Concession</p>
<h3>The Rumors Are Totally Unbelievable</h3>
<p>There is No Trace of Troops in the Yiyuan Garden</p>
<p>The Japanese Academy is Very Quiet</p>
<p>Our Reporter Inspected It in Person Yesterday</p>
<p>Residents of the French Concession Need Not Worry Themselves</p>
<p>In view of the rampant rumors and the alarm and suspicion of residents, Mr. Fevrier, Commissioner of the French Police, specially invited reporters from various newspapers at 8:10 p.m. yesterday, ordered the dispatch of Xi Neng, the Chief of the Political Department of the Western Division, Cheng Ziqing, the Chinese Inspector, and Zhu Gulong, the Chinese Detective, to take a car to inspect all parts of the Yiyuan Dog Racing Track on Albert Road for a week. In addition to the two Chinese police officers on duty and three or five Chinese employees, there were no troops of any kind. The layout of the garden was the same as before, and there was no military equipment at all. According to the gatekeeper, there was a rumor yesterday (the 17th) that French sailors had moved into the garden, but the police authorities abandoned the idea to avoid outside rumors. The inspection ended at 8:40 p.m. and the group then went to the Japanese Cultural Academy (commonly known as the Japanese School) at Fenglin Bridge. The gate was already locked. Only a French soldier with a gun was guarding the courtyard. After being notified, a Japanese man named Fuyeno came out solemnly, claiming to be the liaison officer of the school. Xi Neng, the Chief of the Western Division, explained the purpose of their visit. The Japanese man agreed readily and offered to be their guide. He immediately led them to inspect all parts of the school. Only a dozen or so French soldiers were stationed in the dormitory on the west side of the first floor. In a room on the east side of the second floor, six or seven Japanese were sitting at desks reading quietly. In the center was a large-scale stage-style lecture hall, which was also empty. The third floor was for storing instruments and other items, which had not yet been arranged. There was also no one living there. According to the Japanese man, many Japanese residents originally lived in the school, but due to the increasingly tense situation, all women and children have gradually returned to their home country. Only twenty people remain at the school to watch over it. He added that they are now receiving very thorough protection from the French police and that the rumor of stationing troops is completely unfounded.</p>

<p>Two Groups Oppose</p>
<h3>The Municipal Council Allows Japanese Troops to Run Rampant</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Association of All Roads Business Circles and the Shanghai Special District Citizens' Federation yesterday saw a report that the President of the Municipal Council, Mr. Fessenden, had issued an explanation of the neutral zone. Regarding the Japanese army's destruction of public order in the Public Concession, he said that he was not responsible and specially sent a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers Association to refute him and asked them to send a letter to the Municipal Council as soon as possible to fulfill its responsibility to protect the lives and property of taxpayers in the Concession. The letter said: "We have been informed that during the Japanese army's chaos in Shanghai, it relied on the Public Concession to fight. Our army, in order to comply with the convention of neutrality, did not pursue and annihilate the Japanese invaders, believing that the Municipal Council and the defense forces of various friendly countries had the ability to implement neutral measures to protect the lives and property of Chinese and foreigners in the Concession. However, we have just read the explanation of the neutral zone by Mr. Fessenden, the President of the Municipal Council, which made our government and people suddenly realize that the Concession has no real neutral nature, but only a false pretense. The explanation openly and clearly states that the Municipal Council is not responsible for the Japanese army's destruction of safety in the Concession, and that the defense forces of various friendly countries are also not responsible. In other words, the Japanese army can arbitrarily run rampant in the Concession, because the Municipal Council and the defense forces of various friendly countries can do nothing about it. Isn't this a loss of protection for the lives and property of Chinese and foreign residents in the Concession? Isn't the Public Concession becoming the most unprotected and dangerous area in the world? Our association feels the danger and hereby sends a letter to your association, requesting you to send a letter to the Municipal Council as soon as possible, and to ask the Council to quickly transfer the government of the landlord country to the relevant friendly governments, under the current actual situation, they should immediately ask the government of the landlord country to quickly fulfill their responsibility to protect the safety of the lives and property of Chinese and foreign residents."</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Reconnoiter Everywhere</h3>
<p>Japanese Planes Seen Again Over the Concession</p>
<p>From 8:00 a.m. yesterday, many Japanese planes went to Zhabei, Dachang, Zhenru, and other places for reconnaissance without dropping bombs.</p>
<h3>Iron Window Destroyed by the Bombing of the Telegraph Bureau (Photo by Wang Kai)</h3>
<p>Zhabei: At around 8:00 a.m. yesterday, six Japanese planes were demonstrating in the Zhabei area, three flying high and three flying low. At around 9:00 a.m., a plane was seen circling over the Sun Temple area, flying very slowly, as if it was carrying out reconnaissance. Pedestrians there were afraid that it would drop bombs and fled in panic. The plane then flew west. Another plane flew west along the Public Concession, apparently spying on the situation in Suzhou. At the same time, three or four Japanese planes dropped several bombs on the Tiantong'an area, and the civilian houses there immediately caught fire, burning down several houses.</p>
<p>Dachang: Japanese planes have been flying in the air over Dachang Station for days, and sometimes dropping bombs. Yesterday, after 10:00 a.m., two more Japanese planes flew over the area, leaving after half an hour. In the afternoon, after 3:00 p.m., three or four more Japanese planes came, flying quite high without dropping bombs, apparently carrying out reconnaissance of our military positions.</p>
<p>Zhenru: Zhenru was quiet all day yesterday. Six enemy planes went for reconnaissance in the morning, circling in the air for about fifteen minutes before flying towards Shanghai. It was reported that three of the planes were reconnaissance planes, flying very low, and the other three were flying very high and were bombers, but no bombs were dropped.</p>
<p>Concession: A Japanese plane flew again over the Concession. The Japanese Consul had officially stated to the Concession authorities that they were responsible, but at around 9:00 a.m. yesterday, a Japanese white plane was discovered again in the sky over the Public Concession in the area of Xinzha Road and Nicheng Bridge, flying for reconnaissance. It did not leave for Yangshupu until after 10:00 a.m. Was this really a last resort?</p>
<h3>Wu Peifu's Telegram to Li Menglu</h3>
<p>Advocating Internal Harmony and Unity</p>
<p>Advocating Military Engagement with the Outside World</p>
<p>The Jiji News Agency reported that after Wu Ziyu arrived in Ping, he sent a telegram to Li Menglu in this port, which read: "To Mr. Li Menglu, No. 370 Albert Road, Shanghai, both your telegrams have been received. After a long journey, I have returned home. Whenever I meet with officials in the Northwest and Northeast, I only urge them to harmonize internally, unite as one, and not settle old scores, so that we can have the spirit to deal with the outside world. As a private citizen, as long as it is something that can relieve the country's difficulties, I will do my best to help, regardless of grievances or relatives, which is already known to friends and colleagues in all directions. (Omission) Thank you for your love and attention. Please convey my gratitude on my behalf. I am deeply grateful for your telegram showing that the diplomatic situation is understood by all parties. (Omission) However, the brutal Japanese militarists are tyrannical. It is difficult to achieve anything by relying solely on verbal negotiations without military engagement. Wu Peifu kowtows, gratitude."</p>
<h3>The Ratepayers Association Appeals for Taxpayers</h3>
<p>The Government Should Fulfill Its Responsibility to Relieve the Victims</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Should Be Made to Withdraw from the Concession</p>
<p>The Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Public Concession sent two letters to the Municipal Council yesterday: (1) "We have been informed that the Shanghai Citizens' Federation sent a letter stating that the brutal Japanese relied on their military force to create chaos in our Shanghai, and innocent civilians were suddenly caught in the war. The refugees in the Zhabei districts are already countless. Even in the areas within the Public Concession and the patrol zone, such as Yangshupu and North Sichuan Road, they have also been turned into battlefields, and the dead, wounded, and displaced are countless. Many of the people in the Concession are taxpayers who pay various taxes to the Municipal Council every year. They did not expect that the results would be so disastrous. On the active side, the Municipal Council should immediately adopt effective methods to stop the brutal acts of the Japanese army, restore the powers that the taxpayers have granted to the Municipal Council, and determine its nature. This is the responsibility of the Concession authorities and cannot be shirked. On the passive side, the Concession authorities collect huge amounts of taxes from us every year. In this unexpected situation, they should immediately allocate huge sums of money for relief needs to show that the Concession authorities should fulfill their responsibility to taxpayers. For example, during the food shortage years ago, the Municipal Council also allocated 100,000 yuan to stabilize rice prices. Now, the suffering people are 200 times more distressed than before the rice shortage. The Municipal Council, standing on the path of fairness and humanity, and based on the meaning of local government, should have at least this minimum level of expression. Therefore, we specially send this letter to your association, requesting you to forward it to the Municipal Council for investigation and handling. As for the amount and methods, we will listen to your association's decisions. Please investigate and reply." We have now received a letter from Lu Wenzhong requesting assistance with the refugee problem in the Hongkou area. This type of relief is now being carried out by the Shanghai Citizens' Local Maintenance Association's Relief Group. The number of refugees is very large, and if the Municipal Council can discuss the matter of assistance with the head of the group, it would be greatly appreciated. The Japanese army cannot shirk its responsibility for the occurrence of these refugees, and the authorities and residents in the Concession also have a responsibility. We should handle the matter according to the reasons in the letter." (2) "We have been informed that the Shanghai Clock and Watch Industry Association sent a letter stating that since January 28, the Japanese army has relied on its military force to use the Concession as a base to attack our Chinese territory. The artillery fire has been raging and the bombing has been arbitrary, resulting in the transformation of Zhabei in the Chinese territory and North Sichuan Road in Hongkou in the Concession into scorched earth. The innocent civilians who have been massacred are countless. Even the various districts residing in the Public Concession have been bombarded by Japanese planes, resulting in casualties. Our Chinese merchants have suffered losses of several millions. The reason for the damage is that the Municipal Council assigned the two northeastern districts to the Japanese army for defense. The merchants and residents in the two northeastern districts have the same obligation to pay taxes to the Municipal Council, but the Municipal Council only enjoys its rights and does not fulfill its responsibility to protect them, resulting in the Chinese buildings in the district being bombed by the Japanese army into ruins, and the Chinese merchants and residents in the district being massacred by the Japanese army. Other acts, such as destroying industries and trampling on production, are all due to the Municipal Council's abandonment of its duties. Your association is an organization of taxpayers, and we should send a letter to the Municipal Council as soon as possible to negotiate, withdraw the Japanese army's defense zone, reassign other troops to take over the defense, and protect the safety of commerce and the lives of citizens. This is a matter of public interest." We have found in the statement of the Council and the report of the investigation team that the Japanese army has lost its obligations in the Concession, and its attack on the Chinese garrison in Zhabei has obviously deviated from the independent and uncooperative defense forces of friendly countries, and has further destroyed the common purpose of the defense forces, which is to maintain the lives and property of the residents in the Public Concession. Now that the Japanese army does not cooperate with the defense forces of friendly countries, and instead takes the opposite path to destroy them, the defense forces of friendly countries should take necessary measures to make the Japanese army withdraw from the Concession and accept its defense zone to complete the above-mentioned purpose, and prevent the Japanese army from posing a dangerous situation of destruction. We should handle the matter according to the reasons in the letter and ensure that the Public Concession will not become the site of war again."</p>
<p>Aivenue Road Business Association</p>
<h3>Notice to All Businesses to Pay Police Tax</h3>
<p>The Aivenue Road and Nine Roads Business Association previously issued a notice to the shops on Aivenue Road and Nine Roads that all police taxes and other taxes to the Municipal Council should be deferred because the Municipal Council did not stop the Japanese army from acting freely in the Concession and did not fulfill its protective duties to our taxpayers. Therefore, the Municipal Council has been going to the road to collect donations for several days, but they were all rejected. Yesterday, the Municipal Council specially sent Mr. Robertson, a Western officer, to the association to meet with the two members, Wu Banjiang and Chen Guangxiang, and said that the Municipal Council would absolutely strictly maintain neutrality and would do its best to protect the safety of the Concession and the lives and property of taxpayers in the future. At present, they are trying to stop the Japanese army from acting in the Concession. Please continue to notify them to pay the police tax and other taxes so that the Municipal Council will not stop working due to economic difficulties. The members held a meeting that evening to report everything. They all thought that the Municipal Council's intentions were sincere, so they decided to pay the police tax and other taxes. The association officially notified businesses today that all police taxes and other taxes should be paid.</p>
<p>Eighty-One Public Groups</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Resolution to Raise National Salvation Donations</h3>
<p>Collecting One Month's Rent from All Tenants</p>
<p>Managed by the Organizational Management Committee of Public Groups</p>
<p>The National Salvation Joint Association, organized by eighty-one public groups in Shanghai, convened a general meeting of all directors at 3:00 p.m. yesterday (the 18th). In addition to electing Chu Fucheng of the Zhejiang Public Association, Li Cishan of the Lawyers Association, Hu Fengxiang of the Chinese Taxpayers Association, Zhang Zilian of the Road Business Association, Wang Zhaoshi of the University Faculty Union, Hu Shuhua of the Chinese Institute of Engineers, Chen Peide of the General Labor Union, and Huang Yanpei of the Local Maintenance Association as standing directors, and Feng Shaoshan of the Guangzhao Public Association as directors of each group, they also resolved two important cases. (1) It was resolved to send a representative to the north to urge Zhang Xueliang to lead troops out of the pass and recover the lost land. (2) It was resolved to raise one month's rent in Shanghai as a national salvation donation. The original proposal for raising national salvation donations is recorded on the left. The National Salvation Joint Association believes that the soldiers at the front resisting Japan have worked hard and made great contributions, and should be rewarded, and the wounded and killed soldiers should be compensated. All of this requires funds, and it is necessary to raise national salvation donations on a large scale. The association's economic group was responsible for drafting the fundraising methods. The first group meeting determined that the source of national salvation donations should not be limited to one end, but the easiest way to collect funds is to raise rent from landlords outside the war zone. The general method is that the association recommends representatives from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Bankers Association, the Money Industry Association, the Chinese Taxpayers Association of the Concession, the Citizens Association, the Road Business Associations, the Lawyers Association, and the Accountants Association to jointly form a national salvation donation collection and management committee with the three members recommended by the association's economic group. First, the groups will jointly submit a petition to the municipal government for approval, and use the name of the committee to directly collect one month's rent from tenants outside the war zone in the city, issue national salvation donation receipts, and the tenants will hand over the receipts to the landlords to pay the rent. This method has been decided by the association's board of directors to proceed with. It is now heard that the association is planning to convene a joint meeting of various groups to discuss everything and plan together.</p>
<h3>Two British Soldiers Died from Injuries</h3>
<p>The British Authorities Will Protest to the Chinese and Japanese Authorities</p>
<p>The Great American Evening News reported that two British sailors who were injured by bombs at the Jardine Matheson Wharf in Hongkou yesterday (the 17th) died after being sent to the hospital, one at 5:30 p.m. and the other at 9:30 p.m. They will be buried in the Hongqiao Road Cemetery on Saturday morning. At that time, the bomb fell on the wharf, penetrating directly to the bottom, with a diameter of several inches. The water surged up and threatened to submerge the wharf. Fortunately, the captain of the Ruihe ship sent workers to pour cement into the bomb hole, which was preserved. A sixteen-year-old Chinese girl also died and several Chinese people were injured. It is said that the British authorities have lodged a serious protest to the Chinese and Japanese military authorities.</p>
<h3>Liu Qirui Buried in the International Cemetery</h3>
<p>More Than Eight Hundred People Attended the Funeral</p>
<p>The Commander's Speech Was Accompanied by Tears</p>
<p>When the Zhabei war broke out, the Chinese Red Cross Society organized a war zone rescue team to depart. For more than ten days, the team members worked in the line of fire every day, engaging in rescue work with great enthusiasm. However, the Japanese army was tyrannical and Japanese planes wreaked havoc, firing bullets at the society's ambulances and team members, violating the International Red Cross Convention. Liu Qirui, the commander of the seventh team of the society, went to the Zhabei war zone on the morning of the 15th to rescue wounded soldiers, and was unfortunately shot and killed by a Japanese army bullet. Medical treatment was ineffective and he died on the afternoon of the 16th.</p>
<h3>Western Police Inspecting the Side Gate of the Telegraph Bureau (Photo by Wang Xiaoting)</h3>

They took 21 cars and departed from the general headquarters on Erma Road, first to Xinjia Garden on Xinzha Road to welcome Liu's coffin and board the car, and then drove all the cars to the International Cemetery on Hongqiao Road in the west of Shanghai for burial. At 2:15 p.m., the vehicles arrived safely at the burial site. Commander Wang Peiyuan ordered the team leaders and members and the funeral attendees to go to the auditorium for a memorial service. At that time, Mr. Wang gave an extremely tragic speech, and his words were accompanied by tears, which moved people deeply. Then Mr. Liu was buried in the cemetery, and photos were taken for eternal remembrance.</p>

<h3>Mayor Wu's Visit to Wounded Soldiers</h3>
<p>On the 16th, Mayor Wu personally visited various hospitals such as the Red Cross to comfort the wounded soldiers. As reported previously, at 8:00 AM yesterday, Mayor Wu, accompanied by Director Hu of the Health Bureau, visited five locations including the Orthopedic Hospital, the First and Second Red Swastika Hospitals, Xin Pu Yu Tang, and Shanghai Hospital to offer his condolences. He presented each wounded soldier with a consolation gift of four yuan and told them that this war against Japan was to defend the country. Although they were injured, it was a most honorable thing. The wounded soldiers all expressed their willingness to sacrifice for the country. At the Red Swastika Hospital, a young soldier even jumped up and stood at attention, saying that his wounds had healed and he was ready to advance. Mayor Wu comforted him, advising him to wait patiently for orders from his superiors. His spirit of sacrifice for the country was truly inspiring. Later, he went to Xin Pu Yu Tang on Guohuo Road, a relatively remote location that relief workers rarely visited. The wounded soldiers in each hospital all complained about the lack of quilts and clothing. Mayor Wu immediately instructed Director Hu to take responsibility for contacting all parties to find ways to provide assistance. Mayor Wu also noted that many of the wounded soldiers were bedridden and unable to raise their hands to write letters. He instructed his son, Wu Youlin, to quickly organize a letter-writing team with Cantonese students to visit the hospitals and write letters home for the wounded soldiers to reassure their families. He did not return to the City Hall until 12:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Madam Zhang Xiaolin Visits Hospital to Console</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, Madam Zhang Xiaolin visited the Second Red Swastika Hospital on Avenue Dubail to console the wounded soldiers. She gave each soldier two yuan and each officer four yuan, and also donated medical cotton, gauze, and other supplies to the hospital. She also promised to visit the First Hospital again within a few days.</p>
<h3>Wounded Soldiers at Xin Pu Yu Tang Urgently Need Consolation</h3>
<p>There are more than twenty wounded soldiers in Xin Pu Yu Tang on Guohuo Road in the Nanshi district. Because of its remote location, no one has visited to offer consolation in more than ten days. If people from all walks of life could provide general consolation, the wounded soldiers in the hall would not feel neglected.</p>
<h3>Colleagues at the Longhai Railway Bureau Contribute Funds to Console</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu received a telegram yesterday from the Chief Accountant of the Longhai Railway Bureau, which read: "Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Shanghai Municipal Government: The Japanese invasion of Shanghai has aroused universal indignation. Fortunately, our 19th Route Army has fought bravely, repeatedly defeating the strong enemy, preventing them from succeeding. As the news of victory spreads, we are deeply impressed and comforted. Colleagues from this bureau have specially contributed funds to offer consolation. We are remitting 5,000 yuan through the Bank of China and respectfully request that you forward it to the army for their use. Please acknowledge receipt. Respectfully, Huang Rixin, with seal."</p>
<h3>Patriotic Women Donate to the 19th Route Army</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Federation of National Salvation Organizations, Mr. Gao Shuge of 1027 Jiaozhou Road sent twenty-five silk cotton vests the other day, of novel design and very suitable for the soldiers. They were personally made by Ms. Qiu Ji and her family and designated to be given to the 19th Route Army. She requested that they be forwarded to the front lines and distributed and stated that if anything else was needed, she would continue to do her best to find ways to provide it. This afternoon, a peddler named Jiang Yude, who claimed to have just escaped from the Jiangwan area, gave a detailed account of witnessing Japanese soldiers killing compatriots and burning houses, as well as the 19th Route Army's care for the people, and donated three silver yuan that he was carrying to the 19th Route Army. Mr. Zheng Zhenduo also donated two silver yuan. All were entrusted to the Federation for forwarding to the front lines.</p>
<h3>Continued News on the Tobacco Exchange Industry Collecting Consolation Funds</h3>

<p>American Three Film Companies</p>
<h3>Jointly Filming Japanese Army's Atrocities</h3>
<p>Filming has already begun in the Wusong and Zhabei sections yesterday</p>
<p>Consent from Japanese Authorities Required for Hongkou and Yangshupu</p>
<p>The Japanese army's invasion of our Wusong and Zhabei, fighting for ten days, and their brutal acts have shocked the world. The American Paramount, Fox, and Pathé film companies, seeing this, specially requested our Minister to the United States, who in turn requested the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to consult with the Ministry of Military Affairs and the Shanghai Municipal Government, to allow the three companies to jointly film the truth of the Japanese army's atrocities in Shanghai on the spot and make it into a film to be shown to the world. Now it is learned that our government believes that it is rare to have these three companies represent justice and that Mr. Yan, the representative of our country, originally intended to use radio to transmit the sound of the Shanghai battle's gunfire to the ears of the great powers' military disarmament representatives, but was unable to obtain permission from the Swiss Radio Bureau and could not realize it. Now that a film is being made, it will be like seeing it with one's own eyes, and can better correct international audiences and express our sympathy, so permission was immediately granted. After receiving the news, the company immediately telegraphed its Shanghai branch to contact the military and police authorities to proceed immediately. The Ministry of Military Affairs and the Municipal Government have also instructed their subordinates to assist. Yesterday, the three companies jointly filmed the tragic scenes of civilian houses being destroyed, enemy planes dropping bombs, and corpses being killed in the Wusong and Zhabei war zones. However, since the Hongkou and Yangshupu areas are Japanese military defense zones, the company must submit a request to the American Consul to negotiate with the Japanese authorities for their consent before filming can be done.</p>
<h3>Autonomous Personnel Discuss How to Cope with the Current Situation</h3>

Therefore, Yang Fuyuan and Gu Junyi and others have decided to gather at the Great Eastern Restaurant on Fourth Avenue at noon on the 21st of this month to discuss how to cope with the current situation and have sent letters to invite them separately.</p>

<p>Within the Battle Line</p>
<h3>Residents Have Not Had Food for a Long Time</h3>
<p>Emergency Measures Needed for Relief</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of war between the Chinese and Japanese armies in Wusong, there are still many civilians within the lines of both armies who have not escaped danger. All the refugees within the lines of the Chinese army are currently being rescued by the rescue team. Those who are within the lines of the Japanese army have not been able to leave to this day. However, most of these civilians are poor. Yesterday, Zhu Agui, a carpenter who lived in Wusong, risked his life to escape to Shanghai. According to him, the people currently within the lines of the Japanese army have not had a meal for five or six days. Even I (Zhu himself) have not had a grain of rice for six days. If I don't risk escaping again, I will definitely starve to death.</p>
<h3>Russian People Helping the Villain</h3>
<p>Renting Cars to the Japanese Army</p>
<p>Driving Cars Without a License</p>
<p>Luo Ping (transliterated, owner of Luo Ping Foreign Company, 3 Guangdong Road), a Russian residing in Room 110 of a certain apartment at 155 Avenue Joffre, French Concession, recently rented out a Jui Hui Tuo-branded car No. 1359 to Mitsui &amp; Co., a Japanese company at 48 Sichuan Road, who then sublet it to the Japanese army for transportation purposes. There is a contract, and the daily rental is 30 yuan. He also hired an unlicensed Russian driver, Puluonigufu (transliterated, living at 260 Avenue Albert), to drive, with a daily wage of 5 yuan. However, Puluonigufu is a drunkard. Even during working hours, he cannot forget his drink and still hides a bottle of wine on his body, drinking at any time. The other night, Puluonigufu drove out, with the wine bottle placed in his pocket, and he was drinking as he drove. He was already drunk, his senses were confused, and he lost control of the car. When the car passed Avenue Joffre, French Concession, the front of the car was skewed east and west. A patrolman saw it and, fearing that it would cause an accident, immediately detained the car and took the driver to the police station. It was found that he was an unlicensed driver and that he had rented the car to a Japanese company for use, which was against the regulations. The next day, the driver was first sent to the Second Special District Court, and the police lawyer filed a lawsuit according to the law, requesting that he be investigated according to the law. When Puluonigufu was questioned, he admitted that Luo Ping had hired him to drive without a license. The presiding judge sentenced him to a fine of 150 yuan on file. Yesterday, the police also detained the car owner Luo Ping and sent him to the Second Special Court. The police lawyer Gu Shouxi explained the case, stating that the defendant rented out his car No. 1359 to Mitsui &amp; Co. for use by the Japanese army and ordered an unlicensed driver to drive. The defendant violated the regulations for private cars and Article 13 of the driver's regulations and requested that he be investigated according to the law. When the defendant Luo Ping was questioned, he said that it was because of business failure and that he did not know that he was violating the regulations. He only rented it out for use for three days, from the 14th to the 16th. He only knew that it was for transporting goods and did not know that it was for military use. The presiding judge verified the confession and sentenced Luo Ping to a fine of 500 yuan for his violation of the regulations. The contract stated that the Jui Hui Tuo-branded car was rented to Mitsui &amp; Co. on February 13, the daily rental was 30 yuan, and gasoline and motor oil were not included. The driver Puluonigufu was hired by the car owner and paid a daily wage of 5 yuan.</p>

<h3>News from the Red Swastika Society's Southeast Relief Team</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the first and second teams of the Red Swastika Society's Southeast Joint Relief Team set off simultaneously. More than ten members, in four trucks, drove to Zhabei, passing through Hutai Road, Dachang, to Gujia Town, Liuhang, and other places to work. Refugees along the way, supporting the old and leading the young, fled in a panic. Seeing the flag of the Red Swastika Society, they swarmed over. At one time, more than forty people gathered. More than fifty people continued to seek rescue. Most tragically, there was an elderly man, nearly seventy years old, crying hoarsely, looking westward with reluctance. According to him, his family of five farmed for a living. His elderly wife had been killed by a shell, his son was missing, his grandson had also died tragically, and his daughter-in-law had fled to an unknown location. The family was dead and scattered.

<h3>Important Meeting of Silver and Money Industry Yesterday</h3>
<p>Discussing the issue of principal and interest of public bonds</p>
<p>Continuing discussion and deciding on a solution today</p>
<p>The Shanghai Banking Association, the Money Industry, and the Public Bond Fund Custody Committee, recognizing the significant impact on society of whether or not to repay matured public bond principal and interest, convened a joint meeting of the Silver and Money Industry at the Banking Association's conference room at 3:00 PM yesterday.

<h3>Japanese Cotton Mills on the Verge of Bankruptcy</h3>
<p>After the complete closure of Japanese spinning mills in Shanghai due to the recent Shanghai Incident, its 9,941 looms stopped simultaneously. The average daily output of each cotton mill was 36,891 bales of cotton yarn and 613,576 pieces of cotton cloth, which went out of business along with the war. Moreover, 300,000 bags of American cotton, previously ordered from the United States for the second and third months, have successively arrived in Shanghai. Now that the cotton mills are closed and the goods cannot be unloaded in Shanghai, they had no choice but to be transported to Kobe and sold in Japan. After a meeting of various spinners, each bale was sold at a price reduction of eight or nine yuan from the original price. Therefore, nine major cotton mills, including Shanghai Naigai Cotton, Dai Nippon Spinning, Shanghai Textile, Wusong Nichihua Spinning, Yu Feng Spinning, Donghua Spinning, Toyo Spinning, Shanghai Silk Reeling, and Tongxing Spinning, have found it difficult to maintain their operations and are on the verge of bankruptcy.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Volunteer Corps Continues to Recruit Volunteer Interpreters</h3>
<p>Since the declaration of martial law in the Public Concession, the area north of Suzhou Creek has been defended by the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. It is reported that starting today, the defense will be completely taken over by the 31st Infantry Regiment of the United States Army, while the Volunteer Corps will be responsible for defending the central area. Therefore, the need for interpreters at the garrison locations of various armies has increased sharply. The number of interpreters is urgently needed. It is hoped that Chinese staff members of various Chinese and foreign organizations who have already served in the two teams of the Volunteer Corps will be allowed to continue working. Those who are proficient in Western languages but have not yet joined are also encouraged to participate actively and register with the headquarters of the ___ Team of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps at Room 17, Public Works Department, 4 Ma Road.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To those going to Europe: Our school started its vacation on the 28th of last month. The war in northern Shanghai broke out that night. All the students of our school who lived nearby left the school on that day and went home. The students from afar were safely sent to the He'an Elementary School on Xinzha Road, Shanghai, which the school had borrowed, and stayed there temporarily on that day. We are sending this letter specifically so that you can publish it in the "Letters to the Editor" column to alleviate the concerns of the students' families. We would be very grateful. Respectfully to the Chief Editor of Shen Bao. From Wu Song Merchant Marine School. February 16, 1922. Temporary Liaison Office: No. 3, Renhua Lane, Lu Po Sai Road, Shanghai.</p>
<p>Respectfully, I read the "Huadong News Agency Interview Draft" published in your newspaper on the 18th of this month about the incident of Liu Qirui of the Red Cross being shot and killed by Japanese soldiers. The section that stated that Mr. Liu shouted "Advance and kill the enemy" to his colleagues when he was dying is completely inconsistent with the facts. Since its inception, our association has never deviated from the Japan-Lai-Fo Treaty. Liu Zhaobing risked his life to rescue people in accordance with the Red Cross's purpose, including wounded soldiers of the Japanese army. Our Red Cross also adheres to the principle of universal love and sympathy for soldiers, regardless of boundaries, and treats everyone equally. Mr. Liu was an educated person and had the determination to sacrifice himself to save others. How could he deviate from the Red Cross's position when he was dying and make remarks that would damage the Red Cross's reputation and give the Japanese a handle to damage the position of our Republic of China in the international community? The Huadong News Agency's interview is so far from the truth. Please ask your newspaper to correct it. Respectfully addressed to the Editorial Department of Shen Bao. Sincerely, The Chinese Red Cross. February 18, 1922.</p>

<h3>Publication of the League of Nations' Application to Japan</h3>
<p>The dispute between the two countries cannot be resolved by force.</p>
<p>Delaying a decision will lead to a global catastrophe.</p>
<p>Requesting the Japanese government to recognize its special responsibility.</p>
<p>Respecting China's territorial integrity and political independence.</p>
<p>The following is the full text of the recent application from the League of Nations Administrative Council to Japan:</p>
<p>The friendly relations between the two countries can only be secured by cooperation and mutual respect. A permanent solution cannot be achieved by force, whether it be military or economic. The Chairman of the Administrative Council stated this on behalf of his colleagues in his application to both parties on January 29. The longer the current dispute is delayed, the wider the gap between the two nations will be, and the more difficult the resolution will be. It will lead to a global catastrophe, not only affecting the two countries directly, but also impacting the entire world. The twelve members of the Administrative Council now feel compelled to urgently request the Japanese government to recognize the extremely special responsibility of tolerance and self-restraint imposed on it in the current dispute. Japan is a member of the League of Nations and a permanent member of the Administrative Council. The situation in the Far East last month will be thoroughly investigated by a committee appointed by both parties. However, since the establishment of the committee, the Shanghai Incident has suddenly occurred and is still developing. This has increased the anxiety of the world's population, endangering the lives and interests of people in various countries, adding to the unprecedented difficulties encountered by the world in the current dispute, and placing new and significant obstacles in the path of the Disarmament Conference. The twelve members of the Administrative Council have not ignored the various hardships mentioned by Japan. In these months, it has been given the full trust that a long-term member country should enjoy, as it has always been able to diligently fulfill all the obligations and responsibilities of a member of the international community. However, Japan has not fully utilized peaceful methods of resolution in accordance with the provisions of the League of Nations Charter, which is what colleagues cannot help but regret. We hereby request attention to the solemn undertaking in the Paris Pact that international disputes must not be resolved by abandoning peaceful methods. As for China, at the beginning of the dispute in its territory, it handed over the entire case to the League of Nations and agreed to accept peaceful solutions. This is something that colleagues must acknowledge. The twelve members of the Administrative Council now reiterate Article 10 of the Charter, which stipulates that member states of the League of Nations undertake to respect and maintain the territorial integrity and existing political independence of other member states. Colleagues have the friendly right to request attention to this article. In the opinion of colleagues, what should be observed in particular is that any violation of the territorial integrity of any member state or change of its political independence, regardless of this article, shall not be recognized as legitimate and valid by the remaining member states. Japan has an immense responsibility to establish relations with China with a fair and self-denying attitude before the world. Japan is one of the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty, which states that all signatory countries clearly promise to respect China's sovereignty, independence, and territorial and administrative integrity. Japan recognized this responsibility in the most solemn treaty long ago. The twelve members of the Administrative Council respectfully ask Japan to use the noble meaning of honor to</p>
<p>Recognize the obligations it bears due to its special status and the trust that countries have in it as a cooperative member of a peaceful international organization. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>The full text of the new note from the League of Nations Council in Geneva to Japan was released tonight. The content is as strong as initially expected. The Japanese delegation appeared quite troubled and anticipated that Tokyo might issue a strong response. There are now widespread rumors that Japan intends to withdraw from the League of Nations, which is likely propaganda from the Japanese side. However, it is reported that after this note, the Japanese delegation will no longer submit a protest letter regarding China's request to convene a special meeting of the League of Nations General Assembly and will allow it to proceed naturally. Initially, it was widely rumored that the Japanese government had instructed the Japanese representative to obstruct this move. Now, the League of Nations note has softened it. (Tuanmin dispatch, 17th) The Japanese delegation to the League of Nations in Geneva has raised a legal point regarding China's request to convene a special meeting of the League of Nations Assembly, pointing out that the letter from Chinese representative Dr. Yan requesting the Assembly to discuss the Shanghai case is not a substantial request. Japan also opposes the convocation of a special assembly on the grounds that Japan has not agreed to handle this issue in accordance with Article 15 of the Charter. The twelve members of the Administrative Council have gathered to discuss Japan's objections. In principle, they all believe that Japan's objections cannot be recognized. However, they have authorized Chairman Peng Gu to consult with legal experts and draft a reply to be submitted to the Administrative Council for consideration tomorrow. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Japan's Stubborn Attitude</h3>
<p>Planning not to reply to the League of Nations note</p>
<p>Tokyo The press and political circles seem indignant about the League of Nations Administrative Council's note to Japan, believing that the article contains implications against Japan. The method of dealing with it has not yet been decided, but they all regard the Administrative Council's handling of the concession as extremely irregular. It is likely that they will not reply but only issue an article explaining Japan's position. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>New York The New York Times reported that, according to unofficial sources, Japan will insist on its position without any change in its reply to the League of Nations Administrative Council. The State Department is very uneasy upon hearing this. Political circles view Japan's attitude of handling the concession as an attempt to occupy Zhabei indefinitely in order to seek other special interests in China. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Losses of American Residents in Shanghai</p>
<h3>Japan Should Be Held Responsible</h3>
<p>Stimson Verbally Raised the Issue to Japanese Ambassador Debuchi</p>
<p>The assault on the Vice Consul cannot be settled by an apology.</p>
<p>Washington The Washington Post reported a dispatch from Tokyo stating that US Secretary of State Stimson has notified Japan that the Japanese government should be held responsible for the loss of life and property suffered by American residents in Shanghai. However, inquiries with official circles here reveal that no such notification has been issued. Stimson only mentioned the US may need to take this action when he met with Japanese Ambassador Debuchi on Monday. However, the US government has not yet made a decision on this. (Guomin News Agency dispatch, 17th) The death of a British sailor in the Public Concession of Shanghai has increased concerns among officials here, who believe that such unfortunate events will continue to occur if the fierce fighting does not cease. This is only the beginning. Japanese officials and the State Department have had informal discussions for more than a week on the issue of compensation for losses incurred in the Public Concession due to the Sino-Japanese conflict. The US does not oppose the stationing of Japanese troops in the concession to protect the lives and property of Japanese residents. However, if the concession is used as a base for attacking Chinese territory, the US will oppose it. Japanese officials have assured the commander of the US Asiatic Fleet that they will no longer fire artillery at locations defended by the US within the concession. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Washington Although Japanese authorities have apologized to the US Consul General in Shanghai for the case of Japanese Marines assaulting the US Vice Consul, US Secretary of State Stimson does not believe that the case is closed. It will only be concluded when Japanese authorities arrest the responsible Marines and punish them according to the law. (Guomin News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Return to Suzhou</h3>
<p>Opening Fire with Machine Guns at the Airfield</p>
<p>Six Japanese aircraft returned to Suzhou on the morning of the 18th. Two aircraft flew low over the Baodai Bridge and fired more than ten rounds of machine gun fire at our airfield.

<p>Soviet Authorities</p>
<h3>Deny Increasing Troops on Manchurian Border</h3>
<p>Troops in Vladivostok are solely to defend against White Russians</p>
<p>Remaining silent on Sino-Japanese Affairs</p>
<p>Moscow Today, authorities here denied the rumor that Soviet Russian troops were preparing to enter Manchuria. There has been no news here regarding the increase of troops on the Russian border. Officials generally refuse to express their opinions on Sino-Japanese relations. As a result, the entire press remains silent, with very little commentary on this matter. Those in the Russian capital who are known to be familiar with the situation in Japan also solemnly deny that there is any danger of a Russo-Japanese conflict.</p>
<h2>Page 6</h2>
<p>It is claimed that even the rumored increase in reinforcements by Soviet Russia in places such as Vladivostok is due to fear of an uprising by White Russians, not fear of a Japanese invasion. As for the exiled White Russians who may believe that they can obtain Japanese assistance and attempt a risky move, their efforts will ultimately be disappointed. (Guomin News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Tokyo Soviet Russian Ambassador to Japan, Troyanovsky, visited Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshizawa today to deny rumors that Russian troops were concentrating on the Manchurian border, saying that a small number of troops were being transferred to the vicinity of Vladivostok to prevent a White Russian uprising.

<p>British Government Continues to Cooperate with Other Countries</p>
<h3>British Foreign Secretary Responds to Questions from the Labor Party</h3>
<p>Geneva Today, British Foreign Secretary Simon answered various questions from members of parliament regarding the situation in the Far East, saying that the British government is currently cooperating closely with the countries in Geneva and the United States and is acting jointly. He is deeply aware of the severity of this matter, and everyone is acting with a sense of responsibility. Labor Party member Maxton asked the Foreign Secretary whether he was satisfied with the effectiveness of the actions taken by the League of Nations. Simon replied that he was deeply satisfied that the League of Nations was doing its best. Liberal Party member Mundell advised the Foreign Secretary to propose implementing Article 16 of the League of Nations Charter to restrain Japan. Simon replied that the League of Nations Administrative Council had considered the issue of responsibility for the unfortunate situation in Shanghai under Article 15 of the Charter before receiving information from China and Japan. The Chinese government wants to withdraw its statement to the Administrative Council and submit it to a special meeting of the League of Nations Assembly. Under these circumstances, the British government believes that it is not appropriate to make a hasty judgment on the events under consideration by the court jointly formed by various countries. The British government cannot agree to any suggestions in the House of Commons that advocate for a premature evaluation. Simon also said that the British Consul General in Shanghai has protested to the Japanese authorities about the Japanese army using the concession as a base for military operations unrelated to the defense of the concession. Simon concluded by saying that the British government was unable to provide financial assistance to Chinese flood victims due to financial reasons, which was regrettable. Several Labor Party members asked the government to stop issuing licenses for the shipment of military supplies to China and Japan. The Overseas Trade Minister replied that the British government was not prepared to stop issuing these licenses. Labor Party leader Lansbury inquired about the latest news from Shanghai. Simon informed him of the League of Nations Administrative Council's resolution to send an advisory note to Japan. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>London The case of Japanese aircraft dropping bombs on the Yong'an Cotton Mill in the Public Concession on February 11 was the subject of questioning in the House of Commons this afternoon. Labor Party member Wahlheim asked the Foreign Secretary whether he would take measures to protest this kind of behavior that violates international law and prevent it from happening again in the future. Foreign Secretary Simon recounted the Shanghai Japanese naval commander's reply to the Shanghai US Consul General regarding the protest against this case, saying that the British government had no need to protest. Wahlheim also asked the Foreign Secretary to pay attention to the protest from Simpson, the Secretary-General of the International Relief Committee for Chinese Refugees, against the Japanese aircraft bombing refugee shelters, and asked whether the British government had protested to the Japanese government about this matter. Simon replied that Simpson's protest letter had been delivered to the League of Nations in Geneva on Saturday and would naturally be handled by the League of Nations. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>

Professor Toynbee, formerly a representative attending the Pacific Academic Discussion Meeting in Nishikyoto, and who later traveled in China for some time, delivered a lengthy paper, predicting that there would be a prolonged conflict between China and Japan. The Japanese may win initially, but they will eventually be exhausted and retreat. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>

<h3>The Chinese Embassy in the UK Notifies Friendly Countries</h3>
<p>London The Chinese Embassy in the UK issued a notice stating that Japan's various actions since September of last year have been appalling. China will continue to exert all its strength in all places under attack, in accordance with the right of legitimate self-defense. China deeply desires the assistance of all related countries to resolve the various problems that have arisen in the current crisis based on the principles of safeguarding peace and China's territorial and administrative integrity. It also stated that the Japanese army's use of the Shanghai Public Concession as a base of attack has caused China to suffer losses amounting to tens of millions of yuan, which is appalling. The conclusion stated that Japan has repeatedly declared that it has been trying to explain its attitude in Manchuria and Shanghai. If the countries of the world refer to these declarations and the facts that have been seen and heard, the right and wrong will be immediately apparent. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>

<p>British Newspapers Comment on the League of Nations</p>
<h3>Differing Stances Lead to Different Arguments</h3>
<p>London The Conservative Party's Morning Post stated this morning that the mediation of the Far East issue by the UK, the US, and France has all failed. If one now hopes for the League of Nations to mediate, it may also be in vain. The League of Nations' use of military or economic force cannot provide a permanent solution, and it will only give the belligerent Socialist Party and the pacifists who advocate economic sanctions against Japan an excuse. It is hoped that the Chinese people who harbor the false hope that the League of Nations has a world navy as its backing will understand this. The Labor Party's Daily Express editorial stated that the League of Nations' note to Japan can be regarded as a clear rebuke to Japan. If Japan still does not respect its obligations, it is hoped that the League of Nations will immediately implement Article 16 of the Charter. The Daily Telegraph expressed doubts about whether the League of Nations should allow China to appeal to the League of Nations Assembly, as the countries that will speak most vehemently in the Assembly will be the very small countries in the Far East.

As for naval battleships, they should be limited to 10,000 tons, and the number of cruisers and destroyers should also be limited. From this perspective, the suggestions made by various countries in recent days are largely the same. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Japanese Newspaper Discusses US-Mexico Joint Action Against Japan</h3>
<p>Understanding Has Been Reached Between the Two Sides</p>
<p>Tokyo Jiji Shinpo published an article on the 13th titled "On the Far East Problem, US-Mexico Understanding: Mexico Cooperates with the US to Attack Japan in the Event of War Between Japan and the US." The article stated, "Currently, the US government and the Mexican government have reached an understanding in view of the Far East problem, that is, the US and Mexico have common national interests in the Sino-Japanese dispute. Today, the situation in the Far East is gradually becoming complicated. In the future, the two countries will take joint action and use some means to deal with the disturbances between the countries of East Asia. The two sides have completely understood each other. Although the two governments have not officially exchanged documents, there has been a clear expression in the current affairs commentary of a famous newspaper in Mexico City, titled 'If an Unfortunate Incident Occurs Between Japan and the US, Mexico Should Join the US.' There is also a similar atmosphere in political circles. Most notably, the Mexican government has allowed the US fleet to freely travel through the Panama Canal and submarines and military aircraft to enter Mexican ports for this US military exercise centered on Honolulu. It seems that a tacit agreement has been reached in diplomatic aspects between the two countries. In recent days, various Mexican newspapers have widely published this news, and the Mexican government has not denied it. The facts are clear and cannot be concealed. Therefore, we (the Japanese call themselves) believe that the attention of the US and Mexican authorities to the Far East Sino-Japanese dispute problem is sufficient to prove that the US's China policy has reached an agreement. I do not know how the future development of the overall situation will be." (Fully translated directly from the Japanese)</p>

<h3>Worrying About the League of Nations' Attitude</h3>
<p>Stating That Its Resolution is Favorable to China</p>
<p>The Japanese newspaper Jiji Shinbun said, "The resolution of the executive meeting of the League of Nations Association on the 12th regarding the Far East problem called for a general meeting of the League and cooperated with the United States to seek the restoration of peace in the Far East. The method is to use diplomatic and economic coercive force to resolve it. First, prohibit the export of weapons to both China and Japan. Second, regardless of China and Japan, if they oppose Article 5 of the three-nation joint mediation plan, all ports in the world will decide to boycott the goods of the violating country. Third, suspend finance. Fourth, withdraw diplomatic representatives. This kind of resolution will be conveyed to China and Japan. Judging from today's situation, it seems favorable to China. The recommendation of the general meeting attended by the twelve countries will naturally realize its moral effect, so our Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan) is paying close attention and has already instructed our representatives to vigorously advocate understanding to various directors. If the Chinese side proposes Article 15, Paragraph 9 of the League Covenant, our country (Japan) will resolutely oppose it."</p>

<h3>Continued News of Domestic Disturbances</h3>

In addition to dispersing the crowd, they captured fourteen ringleaders and detained them in the Kanda and Jin police stations.</p>
<h3>Japanese Residents in Wuhan Actively Provoking</h3>
<p>Arranging a Tense Military Situation</p>
<p>But Haven't Dared to Launch Due to Several Reasons</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Since the Shanghai Incident, the Japanese in Wuhan have been preparing to provoke. Fortunately, the government has responded calmly, allowing it to weather this precarious situation. Initially, the Japanese in Hankou actively arranged military affairs. Electric nets and sandbags were erected on all sides of the Japanese Concession, and more than ten artillery emplacements were built. Steel cannons were erected at the entrances and rooftops of the Japanese Consulate, the Navy Club, and major stores. Eight Japanese warships were docked on the river surface, with a tense and imminent atmosphere. After the Shanghai Incident broke out, the Japanese had armed intrusions into the Chinese territory and forcibly entered the Anti-Japanese Association to demand the release of arrested traitorous merchants. The Japanese consul sent a letter to the Hubei Provincial Government and the Garrison Headquarters to ban the anti-Japanese movement. The authorities, following the central government's instructions for calm, returned the arrested traitorous merchants to the Japanese and ordered the Anti-Japanese Association to suspend its activities, which led to temporary stability. After the Anti-Japanese Association ended, the labor community rose up and organized the Labor National Salvation Association to continue inspecting Japanese goods. The business community also organized the Business National Salvation Association, each governing separately, with a somewhat scattered work effect. Currently, the people from all walks of life have decided to reorganize the Wuhan People's National Salvation Association. Once the provincial and municipal party headquarters pass the organizational charter, they can begin to establish it. The Japanese in Hankou have been preparing for a long time, but have not yet launched. There are several reasons: (1) They have not been successful in the Shanghai war and dare not expand the situation. (2) The authorities have already replied to the ban on the anti-Japanese movement. (3) The water level of the Yangtze River has fallen, and the artillery positions of warships cannot be accurately aimed at the shore. (4) The Wuhan military and police are strictly vigilant. Due to these four reasons, the city of Hankou has temporarily remained at peace, which is indeed fortunate. (16th)</p>
