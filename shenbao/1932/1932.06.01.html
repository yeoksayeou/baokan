<h3 id="c1">國人已忘東北之淪亡乎彬 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>自去年九一八禍變突發迄於今兹。已歷時二百五十八日。國未淪亡。而東北之版土。先被分割。同胞先淪爲奴隸。吾人如尚有血氣。則應不能不一自反問。此二百五十八日。究如何度過。</p>
<p>當九一八禍變發生之初。政府曾再四昭示人民。謂决長期抵抗。討伐僞國。以武力收回失地。并勗勉人民鎭靜忍耐。聽從政府之指導。政府决不辜負國家辜負人民。而今則何如。满洲僞國。旣已成立多時。彼日本之軍人政客。且正鼓舞歡笑。慶幸其大功之告成。收復失地。討伐僞國。旣早已無人提及。或且認定今日之東北局勢。决非我國獨力所能挽救。三千萬人民之淪爲亡國奴隸。亦已爲鑄定之命運。於是而苟安者如故。逸樂荒淫者如故。爭權奪利者亦如故。東北之半壁河山。早已置之腦後。嗚呼。政府果眞不辜負國家。果眞不辜負我人民耶。</p>
<p>又若我國民。當禍變始作。亦莫不慷慨激昻。悲憤塡膺。口有言者言東北。手有指者指東北。馬占山所部苦戰龍江之際。國人輸財輸力之踴躍。更得未曾有。迨上海禍作。民氣倍益昻奮。萬衆一心。敵愾同仇。然而今日則又如何。上海雖已信戰。白山黑水之間。敵騎依舊咆哮。敵旗依舊飄揚。東北同胞。依舊淪陷於水深火熱之悲境。吾人則亦已重返於笙歌管弦宴安逸樂之迷夢中矣。東北問題。已不復存於吾人之記憶中矣。嗚呼種族凌夷。山河破碎。奇恥大辱。爲任何國家任何民族。所决不能忘不忍忘者。奈之何我國人今竟健忘耶。其爲苟安旦夕耶。</p>
<p>地地被人强佔如是之廣大。人民被人躪踐如是之殘酷如在他國。吾人知其必臥薪嘗膽。奮死抗爭。即灑盡最後一滴之血。亦不甘眼看敵旗飄揚。誇耀其侵略之勝利是爲立國之精神。亦即一民族得以生存之道。獨有我國任人侵凌。任人宰割。終始酣夢沉沉若無其事者。嗚呼。長夜漫漫。我民族之酣夢。果何時醒來耶。白山黯淡。黑流嗚咽。遥望東北。吾人實無淚可揮。國尚未亡。民未盡死。吾人豈忍令半壁山河。長此變易其顔色耶。</p>
<p>今東北各地之義勇軍。正在苦鬥鏖戰之中。東北之未即淪亡。僅賴有是。我國人如尚未置東北問題於腦後。則積極援助義勇軍。并督責政府討伐僞國。應亦爲義無可辭。脫徒仰望國聯調查團作公正之報告。希望國聯作平允之裁判。則東北殆眞從此陷於萬刦不復矣。國人國人。速其醒來。</p>

<p>新緊急令與總統意見相左</p>
<p>組閣人選興登堡在物色中</p>
<p>國社黨勢力大張無可遏抑</p>
<p>國民社三十日柏林電　德總統興登堡與總理白魯寧、對於頒發新緊急命令、意新辭職之德總理白魯寗</p>
<p>見各殊、因此德内閣業於今晨總辭職、各　員今晨怱怱集議後、白魯寧即驅車赴總統府提出總辭呈、總統乃接受辭職、囑在新内閣未成立以前、照舊供職、據今日正午官廳發表、總統將先與國會議長羅伯晤商、然後按照國會内議席多寡、依次延見各黨黨魁、料需商榷數日、方能委人組閣、一般人現信新閣之命、大約將降於國家社會黨員、並將授以解散國會命令、以便必要時訴諸國人公意、按白魯寧内閣此次突然辭職、頗出於一般人意外、蓋衆人嘗預料白氏今日將繼續與總統商榷、或能安渡難關、考白氏係一九三０年四月就職、其時猶爲天主教中央黨一不甚著名之黨員、今組閣之後、德國感受世界經濟衰落影響、白氏臨以不折不撓之膽毅與袒直、卒能解决許多困難、成爲德國最繋民望之一人、而其内閣亦爲歐戰以後德國歷時最久之内閣云、</p>
<h2>Page 11</h2>
<p>接國外要電</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社三十日柏林電　白魯寧總理之辭職、爲歐戰以後德國政治史上空前未有之閣潮、白氏之辭職、就其内容而言、與歐戰情形大致相似、爾時首相之任免、以皇帝一人之意定之、此次白魯寧之辭職、亦爲興登堡總統個人干涉之結果、興氏爲各政黨所左右、而置議會於不顧、其所引起之閣潮、由伊負個人責任、故閣潮之解决、亦當由渠擔任之、目下衆院之份子已與衆望不孚、故興氏解决閣潮之法、大約不注重衆議院各政黨之意見、其與衆議院院長及衆院各黨領袖晤商者、亦不過一種形式上手續、在表面上使人以爲憲法上所定手續、仍舊遵守而已、實則何人繼任總理、興氏早已知之、而新閣全體閣員名單、興氏於旅居東普魯士或早已定奪、固無待今日之磋商也、新總理或爲蓋爾伯爵、而奥斯敦伯爵之名亦經提及、蓋氏係國家主義黨黨員、完全屬於普魯士軍閥貴族派、爲東普魯士之大地主、爲人聰明果斷、奥氏則爲大農業利益之代表人云、</p>
<h3 id="c108">白魯寧辭職之原因 <a href="#c108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>表示謝絕參加政務</p>
<p>國民社三十日柏林電　德國總統不信任白魯寧内閣之原因、現信由於内閣計劃指撥大地主一部份地産、給失業者墾殖、致招全國大地主尤其東普魯士地主紛起反對之故、但亦有數方面謂此事不過促成總統總理意見相左之引火線、而内閣傾覆之根本原因、實由於選民多數趨向於國家社會黨極端計劃所致、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社三十日柏林電　總理白魯寧辭職原因、大約如次、自白氏任職以來、一切設施均取得總統之同意、一方類於獨裁制、而一方又類於議院内閣制、此蓋由於運用魏馬憲法第四十九條第二項所致、該條允許政府頒布代法律之命令、以施行政治、惟有一種條件、即是項命令在一定期間以内、不爲衆院以三分二之多數所撤銷、方爲有效、此次普魯士邦議會及其他邦議會選舉時、國家社會黨均大佔優勢、而聯邦衆議院中國家主義黨又日形活躍、興登堡遂認爲此種獨裁式、與議院内閣制之混合制度、無法再予維持、以故白魯寧所認爲内閣設施上必要之代法律命令、興氏亦不顧簽署矣、現在右派决計對於左派大施攻撃、左派各黨不久將處於歐戰以來所未曾有之難局云、</p>
<p>國民社三十日柏林電　今夕報告、白魯寧對於其繼續攝行外部之邀請、已加以拒絕、白魯寧非但謂暫時必須擺脫一切政務、並稱目前無論何種磋商、彼一概不參加、白氏將於明日離柏林赴南部、作長時期之休息、現總理職務則暫由副總理第狄立樞氏攝行、</p>
<h3 id="c109">總統延見各黨領袖 <a href="#c109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>國民社三十日柏林電　今日白魯寧内閣之辭職、已使德國陷入一最大之政治危局、毫無疑慮、而興登堡總統在解决此番政潮時、並無軼出憲法軌道以外之意、亦屬同樣顯明、總統接受辭職後、即延見國會議長社會議議員羅伯、談話良久、况乃延見國會内議員最衆之社會黨領袖白萊斯奇德、又次延見國家社會黨領袖希特勒、希氏偕副黨魁戈林同見總統、此種程序皆一循舊例、料明日仍將循例延見議席較少各黨黨魁、僅共産黨因被認爲站在憲法之外、恐總統未必延見、而該黨要人料亦無意進見總統也、今日兩次談話内容、俱未有公報發表、但聞總統力主有組織鞏固政黨内閣之必要、並宣稱渠在任之日、必恪遵憲法不使稍有失墮、惟處目前局勢、即在國會内有大多數擁護之内閣、亦未必能完全不用緊急命令、</p>
<h3 id="c110">左右派氷炭不相容 <a href="#c110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>又電　聞總統曾表示、渠希望各政治領袖能深體此意、在本星期内組成新閣、惟照目前形勢、新閣之能否迅即組成、將全視國家社社黨與天主教中央黨能否捐嫌合作以爲斷、苟非兩黨合作、則在目前國會内不能組成强固之右派政府、然政界意見對於兩黨合作之可能性、頗覺懷疑、因白魯寧已拒絕再任新閣外長、並堅持不能再在新閣内任職、足見兩派未必能爲暫時之合作、再就國家社會黨觀測、似亦無在本届國會内與天主教中央黨合作之象、該黨今方力爭現會國已不能代表眞正選民意思、要求解散改選、因此欲組現國會中大多數議員贊助之内閣、絕少成功機會、</p>

<p>會辦理選舉、而此過渡内閣、或將由保守派領袖韋斯泰浦伯爵組織、此外有繼總理之可能者、倘總統能使國家社會黨與天主教中央黨携手、則前國防總長革斯勒·駐土太使紐拉斯·及蓋爾伯爵·與奥斯敦伯爵等、均有組閣希望、蓋爾與奥斯敦二人爲農黨著名領袖、俱反對新緊急命令、及没收大地主一部份地産撥失業者耕種之議、擁護興登堡總統之立塲、蓋爾現充聯邦會議内東普魯士代表、乃一保守派人物、</p>

<p>罷工宣言　全中國被壓迫的工友們、各界同胞們、近年以來、我們工人的生活、因受政治上經濟上許多複雜的影響、困苦到了無以復加、而自「九一八」满洲事變發生以後、中國資本家、對於日本帝國主義的侵略壓迫、則一再退讓、不稍反抗、但對於我們這班衣不暖食不飽的工友羣衆、却採取積極進攻的策略、他們資本家以「抗日救國」、「提倡國貨」、一增加生産」爲藉口、加緊的實行其剥削這種無恥的殘酷的方法、只有卑賤資本家會實施、而這種悲慘的命運、也只有我們中國工人會深刻的受到、</p>
<p>「一二八」上海事變發生以後、整個的上海淪爲戰場、所有的生産機關、完全趨於</p>
<p>停頓、而我們上海工人、大多數家破人亡、在廣大的勞動市場上、驟增了不少勞動者、於是聰明的資本家、便趁這個失業激增的機會、解雇原來的有組織或工資較大的工人、另雇新的無組織而工資　少的工人、以满足貪而無厭的利慾、於是我們工人旣受了日帝國主義者慘酷的殘殺、又受了中國資本家進一步的剥削、在這雙重嚴厲的壓迫之下、就連呻吟呼號的掙扎之力也消失了、</p>
<p>這種事實、那素以「領導社會」自任的時事新報館資本家、首先實行、作其「領導社會」的倡舉、而我們終日勞作於「文化事業」的工人、也最早受其荼毒、當「一二八」事變未爆發以前民國日報因登載反日新聞、致被帝國主義者所封閉、然而民國日報館方對於帝國主義的壓迫一再屈服、並甘自承認其「暫行停刊」、但對於民國日報的工人、都不顧日帝國主義的砲火尚在向我們猛攻、無情實行解僱、致使民國日報的工友、流離失所、困苦萬狀、而不到兩月、時事新報資本家、竟也别出心裁、借了代印大晚報問題、公開的破壞我們工會組織、破壞不成、即實行會體解僱、到現在雖然也有一部份工友在威脅利誘底下、迫不得已去上工了、可是始終不能屈服而拒絕上工的、還有三四十人、上工的工友、固然在資方收買的一二工　的淫威之下、無形屈服了、時事新報的隂謀、也完全實現了、但回顧數十尚未上工工友的生活、和展望本會的前途、實覺危險萬分、現在我們爲要保障自已的切身利益、和工會基礎的鞏固、不得不與兇惡狠毒的時事新報館資本家作一次後的决鬥、不得不領導了全報界工友、一致罷工、促其覺悟、尚望全中國工友和同胞隨時加以精神上和物質上的援助、</p>
<p>罷工目的　（一）時事新報被迫離館工友、完全上工、（二）被迫離館工友、離館期内、工資照給、（三）賠償工會因此次事件所受之一切損失、（四）本本前與時事新報所訂勞資協約、仍舊有效、</p>

<p>防止藉口索薪暗圖掀動教潮發生</p>
<p>自蘇教廳頒布禁止小學教職員罷教索薪明令以後、外界對於此項訓令、頗多懷疑、記者爲明瞭眞相起見、赴教廳向主管人員探詢意見、承分别解釋如左、</p>
<p>此次本廳禁止罷教索薪之動機、皆因各縣教育界搗亂份子、每每藉口索欠名義、實行包圍舉動、釀成教潮、以致教育行政當局日常事務、皆不能處辦、甚至引起全縣教育之不安狀態、故不能不嚴行制止、並非强令小學教員、枵腹施教、更非將所有積欠、一概取銷、如外界所言奪其應有之權、或阻其謀生之路也、至於小學教員欠薪清償問題、本廳正籌劃分别清理之道、關於此層、應分舊欠新欠兩項、舊欠大概都由歷來濫支與侵蝕而起、時久數多非短時間所可辦理清楚、刻正分則追繳歷年被挪或侵用教欵、一俟得有成數、即當陸續清還、一方對於新欠則竭力防止、其發生其辦法、第一在嚴禁濫支、故近對於各縣預算認眞審核、勵行收支、適合主義、果能實行、如無意外事變以後、當不至再有欠薪情事、本廳對於小學教師生活艱苦欠薪過多、决不漠視、刻刻在思肅清之道、例如此次整理江都教育、一面對於溺職職員因行撤換、但一面仍用盡方法、向拒書嚴追舊欠、并釐訂以後、教費收解辦法、惟積重難返、亦非咄嗟之間可以根本及整個的整理、如遇小學教員實爲生計所迫、作合法之呼籲、本廳自當審察實際狀况、督促各縣行政當局、妥謀救濟、各縣教育當局果有溺職营私等行、爲本廳一經察覺、决當執法以纒、各縣人民如有所見、儘可檢其證據、按照控訴手續、具文呈報、本廳亦必依法辦理、不稍袒護、總之、本廳此舉、在防止不良份子之搗亂、初非不顧小學教員之生計艱苦、而任意壓迫、更非將以前欠薪一概抹煞、外間所謂只許州官放火不許百姓點燈等語、實屬誤會、深望將本廳意旨代爲說明云云、</p>

<p>開了學堂便没處燒香、這是老許愚惑女人的催眠術。我是多麽的心急啊。如果老太太、少奶奶們信了他的話，加入反對我們的集團，我們便要一敗塗地。我是閉着眼兒在想抵制的對策。</p>
<p>忽然聽得一聲「主席！」，只見那位胖胖的宋老太正要開始說話。坐在她前面的吳大媽也喊起主席。王二嫂子拉拉吳大媽的衣服輕輕的對她說：「鐘兒說過，兩個人不能同時說話，等宋老太說了你再說吧。」吳大媽就坐了下來。好一位循循善誘的王二嫂子吳大媽的從善如流也不可及。比一比那此　墨盒打得頭破血出的大人先生怎樣？誰說我們鄕下民權要鬧亂子？宋老太平日愛助貧苦人，負一鄕重望，大有舉足輕重之勢，我是急於要聽她的議論。她說：勸她們不要瞎聽鐘兒的鬼話。我於今要以一個老太太的身分出來回復。我們都有眼睛，耳朶也没有聾。怎麽呌做瞎聽？鐘兒年紀雖小也是一個人，爲什麽他說的話是鬼話？辦學堂不限定毁菩薩，怎麽没處燒香？老身要拜佛，孫兒要上學，在佛殿裏辦學，燒香的時候可以看看孩兒念書，可謂一帶兩便，再好没有。我反對許大哥的提議。」</p>
<p>主席喊吳大媽說話，吳大媽說：「我要說的話，都給宋老太說完了。我贊成辦學堂，不毁菩薩。」</p>
<p>討論完畢、主席付表决，反對辦學的只呻出老許一隻手。一隻手！那是多麽寂寞啊！最有趣的是那位雜貨店老板，因爲不毁菩薩，無害於他的金銀香紙的買賣，他也顧不得老許的寂寞了。</p>
<p>次議十四先生的資格。大家都贊成要請一位頂好頂有本事的人來做先生。至於怎樣才算是頂好，怎樣才算是頂有本事，你只要看一看當日的記錄就明白我們鄕下人理想中的先生是個什麽樣子：</p>
<p>張鬍子說：「先生要貫通四書五經，八股現在没用，要會做策論才行。」　　新近打敗官司的余老五說：「頂好要懂得法律。」</p>
<p>爲兒子到處找媳婦的朱老太說：「要會配八字，寫喜帖，那才便當咧。」　　預備買田的丁老五說：「一定要一位會寫契據的先生。」</p>
<p>富有經騐而怕張鬍子染指又怕城裏時髦先生的宋老太說：「我們要請一個五不先生。一不缺課，二不抽烟，三不賭博，四不毛毛雨，五不妹妹我愛你：：：。」她說得痛快淋漓，引得人哄堂大笑。</p>
<p>我　找一個好的師範畢業生以上的條件都可以達到。最後大家通過的是要找一位合乎以上資格的師範畢業生來做先生。</p>
<p>酬勞也曾談到。大家輪流供飯。每學生三節送禮，每節自一元二元不等，赤貧免送。廟欵充設備費。</p>
<p>春生哥，宋老太，我三個人是被推爲籌備員，負責去找一位頂好頂有本事的先生來。</p>

<p>第十届世界亞林比克運動大會、將於七月三十一日至八月十四日、在美國加洲之洛衫磯城舉行、日本刻正積極準備合宿訓練·約有一百四十人出席是届大會·並擬於大會閉幕之後、自八月十五日起日選手團將邀請他國選手、在舊金山舉行四角形田徑對抗、德國已决定加入、美國英國亦可望參與、同時芬蘭選手、亦將於是時游行日本及歐羅巴洲、彼至日本後、亦當舉行對抗競技、故日本選手無不得意洋洋、抱有極大之希望與興趣焉、</p>
<p>參加世界大會之小史日本之參加世界亞林匹克運動大會遠在二十年前、惟斯時因田徑賽等新時代運動幼稚、僅加入劍撃、摔角、拳術等項目、在近二十年内、新時代運動、努力推進、徐圖宏展、今則嚇然稱雄於世界舞臺矣、當一九一二年第六届世界運動大會在史篇克霍爾StocKholm舉行時、僅派二人參加、是即日本運動選手初現色相於世界競技臺上、一九二０年瑞典之役、日本選手出席者、增至十五人、一九二四法國之會、選手突然倍增、計達三十人之多、此歷届大會中、日本選手已漸露鋒芒、雖得分無多、已引起各運動强國之注意、迨一九二八年荷蘭之集會、日本選手竟超出五十人之多、並創偉大之世界新紀錄、自驕於各國人士之前、令人爲之咋舌、如織田幹雄之獲三級跳遠冠軍、並以十五米五八之成績、建立世界之最高紀錄、</p>
<p>選手團之内容　日本選手團一百四十人中、頗多世界紀錄之保持者　故實力充足、遠勝往昔、選手團中管理及教練曁隨員等、共有三四十人、日本體育協會已邀請森田俊彦氏爲總領隊、選手分田徑賽·馬拉松·游泳·躍水·划船·拳術·及騎術等、其中田徑賽及游泳兩項、實力最强、田徑賽中之三級跳遠及急行跳遠、均爲世界紀錄保持者、此外尚有七種新産之全國紀錄、游泳方面、自信力最强、有七項偉大之成績、在去年美國第一流游泳選手隊在日本對抗時所造成、當時美國游泳選手赴日之總教練、爲耶路大學教練洛勃脫基弗斯氏、亦即本届世界運動會美國游泳隊總教練、基氏覩日本游泳成績之出色、驚奇不置、</p>
<p>他山之石　日本鑒於國際競技運動之重要、努力鼓勵、奬掖選手、並邀請世界名家赴日表演借助他山、以資攻錯、如美國短跑明星薛姆生、及史丹福大學之鉛球與鐵餅錦標哈勞洛勃脫氏、曾被邀請赴日本表演、他如美國全國棒球明星隊、德國田徑隊、法國網球家等、均曾先後訪日、而日本於近數年中、亦屢派田徑賽棒球哥爾夫球等選手、赴各國比賽、藉以考察各國體育之方法、以資提倡之借　、故日本運動界之興高采烈、蜚聲於世界競技界者、洵非偶然也</p>

<p>發表重要談話</p>
<p>江蘇省政府主席顧祝同氏、於昨日下午二時、假威海衛路中社招待本埠新聞界、計到各報及通訊社記者十餘人、席間顧氏發表重要談話如下、</p>
<p>報紙是民衆的導師　諸位先生、兄弟因察看戰區現狀、及與滬上諸位前輩商辦救濟善後等事宜、到此地來得與諸位先生有晤教的機會、非常愉快、上海的新聞事業、開全國風氣之先、有很久遠的歷史、自然形成了中國言論的中心、從來說新聞紙是民衆的喉舌、能代表民衆的言論、兄弟以爲不如說是民衆的導師、其功能在造成民衆的思想、啟發一般民衆對於政治社會等問題的研究、其效力比較教科書要大得多、世界各國文明程度、幾乎可以拿報紙的發行數量來作正比例、歐美諸大報、大多要日行百餘萬份、甚至數百萬份、我們自然還不到這數目、這可並不是報紙的好壞問題、實在是一般人民的智識問題、中國人民不識字的統計、要占到全國總人口數百分之八十以上、比到人家識字的要占到百分之八十以上、恰恰相反、那報紙的銷數、如何能追得上他們呢、所以兄弟希望新聞紙先要做民衆的導師、輔助學校教育、及社會教育、把一般民衆知識、整個的提高起來、然後第二步方是說民衆所要說的話、做他們言論的代表、</p>
<p>報紙是政府的指針　報紙另一方面的責任、在忠實的紀載國内外政治民生的狀况、對政府的設施、予以公正而確當的批評、好比一具指南針、指示政府以政治的方向、這自然是政府所極需求的、尤其是江蘇方面、最近期間、遭遇了極大的水災、又首當國難之衝、受了極大的犧牲、民生的痛苦、和施政的困難、俱達於極點、兄弟及省储同人、極盼望言論界盡量的來指導我們、帮助我們、時時拿各地方民衆實際所受的痛苦、供給我們知道、以補行政方面考察所不及、一方面對我們所做的事不客氣的予以指教、使我們得以參考而謀改進、這是我們所最盼望的、</p>
<p>民生疾苦實際狀况　說到這一點兄弟應該把江蘇最近的民生疾苦、就我們所已經知道的、以及江蘇省最近的施政狀况、簡單的報告一下、供各位的參考、關於第一點民生疾苦方面、也可以再分幾層來說、一是財窮、江蘇不錯是民力財富的省分、可是近幾十年來、生産漸低落、生活日見奢侈、一方面收入減削、一方面支出激增、早已成了外强中乾的現象、再加以水旱偏災、匪患迭見、國外營業、因國際競爭的失敗、而一落千丈、農·工·商·無一不受極大的打撃、再加以這回遭受了滬戰的損失、失業的人口、約計在一百萬以上、財産營業等等的損失、我們正在調查統計中、大約其數之巨、必</p>
<p>現在又要辦兵災的善後了、民生的窮困、實在已到了無以復加的地步、二是匪患的緣故、使良民不安於生業、農村經濟與商市、皆大受影響、窮的因以更窮、更窮而匪患更烈、差不多互相爲因、互相爲果、而民生益不堪設想了、第三是教育中落、江蘇的教育、照現狀的表面上看起來、還是中學小學、社教機關、應有盡有的設着、察其内容、誰不說是暗中在退步、爲什麽原因呢、學風不整飭、學生時有罷課廢學、主持學校的只求無事、對學生課業、不去嚴格的考查、學生的父兄家長、拿血汗之資、來呌子弟求學、現狀如此、豈不痛心、而文化的降低、自不消說了、况且原有教學方法、也不盡適合於社會需要、學生畢了業、在社會上求不得事做、教育的效力實在不能認爲满意、四是實業不興、中國以農立國、江蘇又是天産豐富之區、可是不要說别的、只就農産物中最主要的一項、「米」來說、蘇省所産的米、已不够本省需求、其他如蠶絲等、也遭了很慘重的失敗、至於我省原有的小工業、即手工工業、如土布等等、漸從衰敗、以至於消滅、更不必說了、總括上面所舉民生疾困的現狀、成爲不列的兩句話、一·人民不能安居樂業、二·人民不能亨受教育、所以同人等認爲施政方針、應該拿這兩句話來做對象、而籌　根本救治的辦法、</p>
<p>同人最近設施方針　現在再把同人等最近設施、報告一切、對於財窮的救治、治本、要發展生産、要發展生産、就須改良農種、興修水利、便利交通、這多是實業建設兩廳所主管、我們已經舉辦的、改良蠶種、設立蠶業取締所、劃金壇爲蠶桑實騐區、推銷改良、頗有成效、不過今年時令不正、蠶業很受損害、稻麥方面、也各設了試騐塲、研究改良、水利方面、急要的在江北方面是修復運堤工程、現在差不多要完工了、根本還要注重導淮、江南方面海塘工程、實極重要、現與上海市政府、合設一個江南塘工委員會、積極進行海塘工程、交通方面、最要的是省路縣道、現正在切實進行中、治標、是謀這次戰區救濟、現在中央已設立淞滬戰區善後委員會、江蘇也有戰區救濟委員會之成立、對通盤的救濟、由中央撥給大批欵項舉辦、臨時的急救、由省府設法舉辦、關於匪患的救治、也分爲根本與臨時兩項、根本方面、亟須謀人民之自衛、以補政府力量之不及、爲統籌自衛辦法起見、省中設立之省保衛委員會、各縣分設保衛委員會、責成專辦各縣保衛事宜、設計訓練、由省方主持、各縣切實遵行、臨時方面、成立了蘇松水上剿匪臨時指揮部、以圖清除江南匪患、關於教育中落的救治、一方面嚴格整頓學風、凡有破壞學校紀律的事情發生、不惜忍痛嚴厲處置、如處治徐中風潮一事、可見一斑、現仍由教廳通飭全省學校、切實告誡學生、務使盡守軌範、一面研求教育適合需要、尤其是社會教育方面、注重識字教育及生計教育、使教育得以普及、并能增加生産、成爲有利的教育、關於實業不振的救治、大致情形、已見上面所說的財窮治本辦法、上月省府有一個通令、給全省各縣·主意就在見到地方生産敗壞情况、要他們擬議救濟辦法、對於地方提倡原有小工業、以維持平民生計、尤爲注意、這是上面没有說到的、總而言之、社會是整個的各種的病象、皆有互相聯帶的關係、所以政治也是整個的、止辦一方面、决收不到效果、醫如匪患肅清了、自然可便人民安居樂業、生産增富、人民各有職業、匪患才能根本肅清、教育適合於職業需要、人才多了、實業自然可以振興、可是也要實業振興、人才才有用武之地、教育方收得實在效果、所以設施不能專看一方面、要用全力來刷新整個的政治、方可以救社會整個的病痛、同人自愧才力薄弱、現在已有省政討論會的組織、以備集合意見、規畫一切、但是担負這樣一個重大的責任、自不免有許多考察不能周到和設計不能詳密的地方、希望居全國領袖地位的上海言論界、多多的指導、多多的帮助、還有省政方面其他許多事、已經在昨天承國難救濟會等招待時發表過、各位都已知道、不再重說云云、顧氏致詞畢並由教育廳長周佛海、民政廳長趙啟騄相繼申繼申說教育·民政·之不良現象及今應如何努力謀補救改進之方針甚詳、最後並盼望新聞界予以有力之援助、</p>

<p>近來國産電影界，走的差不多是一條路，就是愛情影片，張三愛李四，李四變良心，千篇一律，簡直鬧得有些令人討厭了。間或有些不同的情節，又多數是描寫貴族階級的作品，電影藝術，簡直成了少爺小姐的娱樂品天一公司新出的聲片「有夫之婦」，描寫一對勞動階級的貧賤夫妻，受盡生計的壓迫，妻又被一個富家少年所誘，終致失足，結果，那勞動者和富室少年，都遭慘殺，情節方面，非常熱烈緊張，又加演員選擇得當，（主演者爲宣景琳·孫敏·張振鐸·李麗蓮·）表情逼眞，更加了許多動人之處。</p>

<p>有一個外國人曾經批評說：「俄國是永遠有快樂的地方和到處能遇着快樂的人們，如若有一個俄國人能得到一塊白麵包，或三碼粗布，或一雙線襪，這便是造成他快樂的種子了」。像我們這些緊縮到了極點，餓了没吃，冷了没穿，能得每一樣小物件都覺着快樂的人們，以爲他的話是不錯的。</p>
<p>今天我做了一件很快樂的事。我以十二羅卜買了一雙像皮鞋。（從前只值一羅卜二十Ｋopecks）可是在先我還得交付舊鞋三雙，並且預寫一收條，而於取鞋時，以此收條和十二羅卜去換。現在春天，天氣潮濕，我們當然得要保護足部的衛生，所以我才用十二羅卜的代價去買一雙的，老實的說罷，我們現在唯一的産業只有健康，此外一切身外物都被政府攫去了。不過話又說回來了，我總覺得比資本主義的國家的工人，給資本家抓在鐵掌之内枵腹工作，要强得多，換句話說，我們不會失業和鬧飢荒的，雖然我們是這樣的痛苦。</p>
<p>在莫斯科最有趣的，乃是一種貴族式的聯合商店在門口寫着：「本店祇收現金或外幣」。這是用俄文寫的，不識俄文的外人當然不會懂，所以在進門時便有一個門役對顧客低聲說：「只要黄金或外幣」。這樣專在民間收括現金的辦法，是常常激動人們的情感，使人們不安的。而這種商店，出售的又是生活必需品，因此有一種實在没法的人，只得拿了最後的結婚金戒子，或金十字架，換得一件襯衫，或一雙鞋子，或一條床氈等物。價錢又奇貴，别處值一百七十羅卜的鞋子，這種商店得售洋三四元。我們所得的薪水乃是紙票，而購買物品時，知須付現金或外幣，你們想除了俄國人民，還有那一國人民能忍受？我們都被逼着不要命的做工，把我們努力造成的貨物傾銷到外國去，讓國家盡量從外國收括現金來集中於世界以革命聳動人的俄國，和我們人民不知道究竟有些什麽利益？</p>

<p>密密層層之輓聯　會塲四周，預支竹架，徧懸輓聯，其數之多，不可勝計。苟首尾相銜，引而伸之，足可直達車站，聯語之精警者，亦屬美不勝收，苟能彚集付梓，殊有永留紀念之價值。大門口一五六旅張君嵩團長一聯，雄壯可誦，特錄之如下：聯云「是國家柱石，是民族先鋒，氣吞倭宼，神勇遠震全世界！」「爲正義犧牲，爲和平奮鬭，血濺滬野，忠魂長繞大江南！」其他銀盾花圈，堆積纍纍。我東吳大學，除致賻儀三百餘元外，又聯合其他教會學校送大銀盾一具，上鐫「烈士血，華族魂，垂萬古，浩氣存！」十二字。至宣傳之印刷品，四處紛飛，種類不一。籌備會製有會刊一本，列述死喪官兵姓名履歷甚詳。惜記者隨同東吳校隊伍自側門而入，未能取得。曾借閱一過，爰紀其傷亡表如左：</p>

<p>附記：義勇軍及憲兵團電雷隊鐵道砲隊等不在本表統計之内</p>
<p>可敬可愛之光榮戰士　是日十九軍參加之兵士約三團，第五軍約一團。第五軍之官兵衣黄呢制服，整齊嚴肅，而軀幹彪偉，精神飽满；十九軍則衣青灰布制服，短褲露膝，背繋光榮無上而受外人崇拜之十九路軍戰笠，（聞此項戰笠已爲美國人載送彼邦陳之博物院中）身材雖較短小，而勇健活潑，實足表示我中華民族之國魂。記　行經其旁，爲之血沸神動，非特一變曩昔因厭惡内戰而連帶厭惡兵士之心理，且欲向此衛國愛民之神聖戰士而頂禮膜拜之也！　　悲壯熱烈之空氣　塲中氣象，除充满嚴肅悲壯之空氣外，尤有一可喜之現象。蓋全塲中參加追悼之男女，無論制服便衣，百分之九九，皆國産之布綢，間有一二平日以衣舶來品爲漂亮之所謂摩登男女，至是亦相形見絀，自覺慚恧。竊爲此種現象，苟能普徧於會塲之外，且永久繼續，實爲挽回我垂絕國運之唯一靈藥！此爲我全體民衆應盡之責任，苟具决心，亦輕而易舉。設或併此以舶來品爲榮之媚外心理而不能犧牲革除，則將何以對彼捐生命，棄室家之陣亡諸將士乎？我今奉懇政府諸公，社會領袖，及受教育之青年學子，於此起死回生之唯一靈藥，躬先倡導之也！</p>
<p>個人感想之貢獻　嗟乎！死者已矣！後死之責，將何所貢獻？東北之失土未復，烈士之遺族何託？我聞諸參預戰役之某軍士言，政府以庫欵支絀，陣亡諸將士之恤金，迄今未發。諸烈士視死如歸，固死得其所；然彼寡妻孤兒，與夫年高之父母，失所憑依，將何以爲生？淺而言之，我人之身家生命，旣賴諸將士之熱血而得保存，對此孤寡，獨忍淡焉忘之，而不思有以圖報之乎？記者涉筆至此，願掬我熱誠，以與全國同胞共勉之也！（此稿潤資請申報會計處移付衛國將士遺族撫育會）</p>

<h3 id="c219">婦女吸烟與風化 <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— 松廬</p>
<p>據昨日世界社東京通信，政府烟草專賣局，近來公布出售一種專供女界吸用之新捲烟，致引起女界之大反對，各婦女團體紛推代表訪問該局長，謂此舉無異於政府奬勵婦女吸烟，妨礙社會風紀，要求取銷出售新烟計劃，</p>
<p>婦女吸烟之有關風化與否，這的確是一個值得研究的有趣問題，本來紙烟這樣東西是有害而無益，這是誰也不能否認的，現在我們所要研究的，是二種問題，一爲婦女可否吸烟，二爲婦女吸烟是否有關風化，</p>
<p>關於婦女可否吸烟一層，我以爲是絕對可以的，因爲揆諸男女平等的原則，男子旣可吸烟，女子爲什麽就不能，關於風化一層，根據這個原則，也是一樣，男子吸烟旣無關風化，何以女子吸烟就會有關風化呢，難道不良的風紀，是只可由着男子去提倡，女子就不能效法嗎，</p>
<p>這一篇原是日本人的賬，本來不關我們的事，用不着我們來替日本當局張目，不過我國婦女吸捲烟的風氣，恐怕比日本人還厲害，上而至於貴族化的太太奶奶小姐，下而至於白相人的嫂嫂，都有「飯後一枝烟，猶如活神仙」之概，婦女吸捲烟，雖爲法律所不禁，但是畢竟造成一種非善良的習慣，在道德觀念上講起來，總以設法消弭爲是，本來婦女的消耗品，也實在太多了，假使眞以消費平等的理由說起來，就是不許婦女們吸烟，也不爲過，因爲她們在化妝上服裝上處處都比男子消耗得多，吸烟一事，就讓給男子們「專利」吧，</p>
<p>但是從正當的原則講起來，不但女子吸烟應該反對，就是男子吸烟，亦無嘗可以允許，眞是「勞民傷財」而結果半點得不到好處，反而有害衛生，這又是何苦呢？</p>

<h3 id="c222">甘油 <a href="#c222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— 庶民</p>
<p>甘油在工業上用途極廣，兹將其性質製法用途分述如次，</p>
<p>甘油爲無色粘稠之液體，其味甘，西文呌Ａlycerin、他的分子式是C3H8　屬於有機體中之三價醇類，純凈者，在攝氏十七度結晶，二百九十度沸騰，人體血内含有少許，腦内之Lecithine與脂肪，皆甘油之化合物，工業上係用各種植物的油脂，再設法使其分解爲脂酸與甘油，脂酸爲造洋燭之主要原料，脂酸之鈉鉀鹽，即是肥皂，故燭廠與肥皂廠的副産品，就成爲甘油的大宗來源，　　從動植物的油脂取甘油的方法有以下種種，（一）脂肪加清水和少量之觸媒，如石灰或養化鋅等，皆可用爲分解油脂之觸媒，再將此混合體在六倍至八倍之高气壓下，加熱至一百七十度（攝氏表）油脂即分解成脂酸與甘油，（二）在油脂之含水混合液内，加入一種酵母，這種酵母通常取自菎麻子内，再加入少許酸類使帶微酸感應，加熱至攝氏四十度，油脂不自行分解，（三）加濃硫酸或苛性遭達，苛性加里於油脂内，再加熱煑之，甘油亦可自行游遊分解·此法爲昔時燭廠與肥皂所常用者，（四）近人更有用磺酸　與磺酸駢　等爲觸媒劑，加入油脂内，再入少量清水，加熱至一百度，甘油自行析出，按第一法與第四法，所得甘油很純潔，爲現今盛行之新法，歐戰時，德人所需甘油爲製造炸藥之用，供不應求，德人康斯坦將第二法之酵母大加改良，先用澱粉造糖，再由糖内加入等量亞硫酸鈉與酵母，使之發酵，如此能使酒精之生成量由百分之四十减至二十三，甘油之生成量由百分之一十一加至二十七，惜此法成本過高，失去市塲競售能力，仍不見用於工業家，</p>
<p>甘油在工業上最大的用途，是造炸藥，有名的Dynamile，即係用硝化甘油吸入細砂粉而成，他的製法，請參看本月十三號本報本欄，此外香妝品，如女子所用唇紅，髮膠髮油，漱口水，牙膏等等，均含有之，醫藥上可以製成藥膏及冬日防皮膚凍，裂爲潤澤皮膚之用，又不易自乾，與松脂　麻油蜂糖等調和成室内捕蚊膠，與弗美林混合，可爲菓園内殺害虫之用，他如打字機上之顔色帶，複寫紙，印泥印墨等，皆甘油與顔色之混合物耳，甘油液有彈性，故管退砲與水壓機，亦利用之，如甘油與加里肥皂液松節油混和擦玻窗，在冬日水蒸汽不致凝固上，而妨害透視，故飛行家航空時，非先用甘油肥皂擦眼镜不可，棉紗上光，防煤氣表内之水結氷，調和各種食物酒味，亦用之，最後甘油與養化鉛粉末調合，爲最好之金石玻璃膠合劑，</p>

<p>— 澤永</p>
<p>F中學的校長，他是一位很崇尚歐化的人，他對於英文一門，特别擅長，所以他特地聘請了一位美籍的青年女教師，來教授初中二年級甲班的英文課程　　這個女教師，年事很輕，還不過二十歲左右，專門歡喜打扮得花花綠綠的，每到教室裏來授課的時候，那教室裏，頓時便充满了一種不可思議的香，令人幾至全身麻醉，</p>
<p>密司忒Ｋ，他是一位本級英文最好的，全級的同學，除了他没有一個能比得上，說起會話來，眞是滾瓜爛熟，如數家珍，因此那位青年的女教師，很是歡喜他，</p>
<p>Ｋ所坐之座位，却爲最前一排，距離講台很近，一天，又是英文課了，别的同學，很是討厭英文，惟有Ｋ他每逢英文課，必定是喜形於色，上課鈴還没有打，Ｋ老早已坐在案桌上了，</p>
<p>「叮呤！叮呤！叮呤！：：：」</p>
<p>上課鐘打過了，同學們都絡續從外面走進課堂來，那位青年的女教師，挾了一本洋書，隨後也走了進來，</p>
<p>「老Ｋ，今天又是你的艶福到哩，那種芬芳的香氣，連我也借你的光不少</p>
<p>哩！」坐在Ｋ後排的Ｔ，用脚跌着Ｋ坐的椅子，這輕輕的說着，</p>
<p>「你這油嘴」Ｋ帶着笑駡的語氣，這樣的說著。</p>
<p>點過了名，那位女教師教了一課書，便笑迷迷的指着Ｋ講解一篇，Ｋ聽了，好像捧到聖旨一般，連忙站起來，捧着書吚吚唔唔的講起來，那位女教師却走下講臺，坐在Ｋ的案桌上，聽他的講，Ｋ後面的Ｔ，却早已心醉骨酥了，</p>
<p>Ｋ講完了書，那位女教師便放下書本，右手指了一個字，一面却撫摸着Ｋ的頭髮，打着本地話說。</p>
<p>「這個字你讀錯了，應該要讀高音的，你却讀了低音」，說話之間，她的頭差不已偎在Ｋ的頭上，</p>
<p>Ｋ這時那裏還有什麽心思去聽她的解，早已麻醉得全身酥軟了，</p>
<p>叮呤叮呤的下課鐘，打斷了Ｋ享受艶福的機會，許多同學，不待先生出去，早已一哄的走出教室，那位青年女教師，便也挾了書，翩翩的去了，Ｋ旁邊的Ｔ，Ｄ和Ｓ，却嘻嘻的過來，Ｄ說：　　「Ｋ恭喜你，那位密史鍾情於你了，」</p>
<p>「不要胡說，」你看見的嗎」Ｋ說，　　「呀喲丨外國駙馬架子大得來」，Ｓ拍着手說，</p>
<p>Ｋ霍的立了起來，跑出教室外去了，於是許多同學，便你一句外國駙馬，我一句外國駙馬的大嘩不止，</p>

<p>甲：聽說你老兄近來常作些「文藝」的「談言」在報章上發表，可是眞的？</p>
<p>乙：是的是的，有時關於「科學」的也「隨便談談」。不過都是些「瞎三話四」的東西，還得睛先生指教指教。　　甲：好說好說！像你老兄從前所著的「譚瀛」，對於那些「醉生夢死」的人們，正夠警惕，可是，「唉！世風日下，何常又不是「說也徒然！」　　乙：是的·對於那些「無藥救」的人們，眞是没有辦法，可是像「學堂寫眞」那類的文章，我想對於學生至少是有相當補救的吧。</p>
<p>甲：這固然不錯，譬如「街頭巷尾」那些「不可思議」的事，正是多着·照理都應當「拆穿西洋鏡，」看他們「阿好意思」不？</p>
<p>乙：對了，雖然是「一鱗一爪，」其實都應當「有聞必錄。」</p>
<p>甲：正是這個意思呀！只要是「社會的一角」所發生的問題，不管他「東西南北，」即使是「竹頭木屑，」我們都須要加以分柝，看看它「爲什麽？」會這樣，其原因到底在那裏？</p>
<p>乙：是極是極，大至國家大事，小至「市塲訊，」都是我們所當注意的。</p>
<p>甲：然而有的却只談「電影」或「性的問題，」那眞是「莫明其妙。」</p>
<p>乙：錯是不錯，可是爲了「麵包問題」又有什麽辦法呢？</p>
<p>甲：那末你自已也是爲了吃飯來作文章的囉？那才「豈有此理。」</p>
<p>乙：其實我們都是「無生路」啊！你也不必說别人罷。</p>
<p>甲：不，你這個人眞是「可嘆！」</p>
<p>乙：然而你也像煞有介事的却也「可笑！」</p>

<h3 id="e1">Did the People of Our Nation Already Forget the Fall of the Northeast, Mr. Bin? <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Since the sudden outbreak of the September 18th Incident last year until now, 258 days have passed. The nation has not yet fallen, but the territory of the Northeast has been divided first, and our compatriots have become slaves first. If we still have any spirit, then we cannot help but ask ourselves: How have we spent these 258 days?</p>
<p>At the beginning of the September 18th Incident, the government repeatedly declared to the people that it was determined to resist for a long time, to punish the puppet state, and to recover the lost territories by force. It also encouraged the people to remain calm and patient, and to obey the guidance of the government, stating that the government would never fail the nation or the people. But what is the situation now? The puppet state of Manchukuo has already been established for a long time. The Japanese soldiers and politicians are even cheering and rejoicing, congratulating themselves on the completion of their great achievement. Recovering lost territories and punishing the puppet state are no longer mentioned by anyone. Or perhaps it is believed that the current situation in the Northeast cannot be salvaged by our country's sole effort. The fate of 30 million people becoming slaves of a conquered nation has also been sealed. Therefore, those who seek temporary ease remain the same, those who indulge in pleasure and dissipation remain the same, and those who fight for power and profit also remain the same. The half of the rivers and mountains in the Northeast has long been forgotten. Alas! Has the government truly not failed the nation? Has it truly not failed our people?</p>
<p>Furthermore, when the disaster first struck, our people were all filled with righteous indignation and grief. Those who spoke, spoke of the Northeast; those who pointed, pointed to the Northeast. When Ma Zhanshan's troops fought bitterly in Longjiang, the enthusiasm of the people in donating money and resources was unprecedented. When the Shanghai Incident occurred, the national spirit was even more aroused. Everyone was united, sharing the same hatred against the enemy. But what is the situation today? Although Shanghai has ended its battle, the enemy cavalry still roars and the enemy flag still flies between the White Mountains and Black Waters. Our Northeastern compatriots are still trapped in the tragic situation of being in dire straits. We have also returned to the dream of singing, music, feasting, and pleasure. The Northeast issue is no longer in our memory. Alas! National decline, shattered mountains and rivers, and extreme humiliation are things that any country and any nation can never forget and cannot bear to forget. Why are our people so forgetful today? Is it for temporary ease?</p>
<p>So much land is forcibly occupied by others, and the people are trampled on with such cruelty. In other countries, we know that they would be lying on firewood and tasting gall, fighting to the death. Even if they shed the last drop of blood, they would not willingly watch the enemy flag flying and boasting of their victory of aggression. This is the spirit of establishing a nation and the way for a nation to survive. Only our country allows others to invade and slaughter at will, always sleeping soundly as if nothing has happened. Alas! The long night is endless. When will our nation's slumber wake up? The White Mountains are dim, and the Black River sobs. Looking into the distance at the Northeast, we really have no tears to shed. The nation has not yet perished, and the people have not all died. How can we bear to let half of our mountains and rivers change their color for so long?</p>
<p>Today, the volunteer armies in various parts of the Northeast are fighting hard. The fact that the Northeast has not yet completely fallen depends solely on this. If our people have not yet put the Northeast issue behind them, then actively assisting the volunteer armies and urging the government to punish the puppet state should also be our unshirkable duty. If we only look up to the League of Nations Investigation Commission to make a fair report and hope that the League of Nations will make a fair judgment, then the Northeast will truly fall into eternal doom. People of the nation, people of the nation, wake up quickly!</p>

<p>Our Country Has No Meaning in Participating</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to international experts, the strong powers of Britain, the United States, and France sincerely hope that Japan can stand up to resist the Soviet Union. Japan is also deliberately expressing its resistance to Russia in order to cater to the psychology of the powers and make the powers sympathize with Japan and reduce their attention to the China issue. However, Japan is still constantly flirting with Soviet Russia. The fact that the European powers are in favor of opening a round table conference as soon as possible is the subtle effect of Japan's two-sided diplomacy. According to our government, our government has not yet prepared to participate in the round table conference at this moment. The government intends to open a Pacific-style conference similar to a round table conference so that the Northeast issue can be resolved under the public justice of the powers. Our government will not hesitate to accommodate the goodwill of the British and French powers. Now, because Japan has not abandoned its prejudice against allowing third countries to participate in the Northeast, we have no meaning in participating in the conference. Moreover, the United States is not a member of the League of Nations, and Russia is not a member of the League of Nations. If a round table conference is produced under the guidance of the League of Nations, the participation of the United States and Russia has no legal basis. (Special Dispatch on the 31st)</p>

<p>New Emergency Decree Conflicts with President's Views</p>
<p>Hindenburg Seeks a Cabinet Formateur</p>
<p>National Socialist Party's Influence Unstoppable</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 30th – German President Hindenburg and Chancellor Brüning disagree on the issuance of a new emergency decree, prompting the resignation of the German Cabinet this morning. After a hasty meeting, Brüning drove to the Presidential Palace to submit the collective resignation. The President accepted the resignation, requesting the cabinet to continue in its functions until a new cabinet is formed. According to an official announcement made at noon today, the President will first confer with Reichstag President Löbe, and then consult with the leaders of each party in order of their seat count in the Reichstag. It is expected to take several days of deliberation before someone is commissioned to form a new cabinet. It is now generally believed that the mandate to form a new cabinet will likely fall upon a member of the National Socialist Party, who will be granted the power to dissolve the Reichstag to appeal to the will of the people if necessary. The sudden resignation of the Brüning Cabinet was quite unexpected, as it was generally anticipated that Brüning would continue discussions with the President today, potentially navigating through the crisis. Brüning assumed office in April 1930, when he was a relatively unknown member of the Catholic Centre Party. After forming the cabinet, Germany experienced the impact of the global economic recession. Brüning, with his unflinching courage and candor, was able to resolve many difficulties, becoming one of Germany's most respected figures. His cabinet also became the longest-serving in Germany since the end of World War I.</p>

<p>Received Foreign Dispatches</p>
<p>Havas Agency, Berlin, 30th – Chancellor Brüning's resignation marks an unprecedented cabinet crisis in German political history since the end of World War I. In its essence, Brüning's resignation is broadly similar to the situation during World War I, when the appointment and removal of the Chancellor depended on the Emperor's sole discretion. This time, Brüning's resignation is also the result of personal intervention by President Hindenburg. Hindenburg is swayed by various political parties, disregarding the parliament. He bears personal responsibility for the cabinet crisis he has caused. Therefore, he should also be responsible for resolving the crisis. The current composition of the parliament no longer reflects public opinion. Therefore, Hindenburg's method of resolving the cabinet crisis will likely not focus on the opinions of the various parties in the parliament. His consultations with the Speaker of the Parliament and the leaders of the various parties will merely be a formality to give the appearance that the procedures stipulated in the constitution are still being observed. In reality, Hindenburg already knows who will succeed as Chancellor, and the list of all members of the new cabinet may have already been decided during his stay in East Prussia, so there is no need for consultation today. The new Chancellor may be Count Gehr, and the name of Count Austern has also been mentioned. Gehr is a member of the Nationalist Party, entirely belonging to the Prussian Junker aristocracy and is a large landowner in East Prussia, known for his intelligence and decisiveness. Austern is a representative of major agricultural interests.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Reasons for Brüning's Resignation <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Expresses Refusal to Participate in Political Affairs</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 30th – The reason for the German President's lack of confidence in the Brüning Cabinet is now believed to be due to the Cabinet's plan to allocate part of the land of large landowners to the unemployed for cultivation, which led to opposition from landowners across the country, especially those in East Prussia. However, some sources say that this was only a spark that triggered the disagreement between the President and the Chancellor. The fundamental reason for the cabinet's downfall is the majority of voters tending toward the extreme programs of the National Socialist Party.</p>
<p>Havas Agency, Berlin, 30th – The reasons for Chancellor Brüning's resignation are roughly as follows: since Brüning took office, all measures have been approved by the President, on the one hand, resembling a dictatorship, and on the other hand, resembling a parliamentary cabinet system. This is due to the use of Article 48, Paragraph 2 of the Weimar Constitution, which allows the government to issue decrees in lieu of laws to implement policies, with one condition: the decree is only valid if it is not revoked by a two-thirds majority of the parliament within a certain period. In the recent elections for the Prussian state parliament and other state parliaments, the National Socialist Party gained a significant advantage, and the Nationalist Party in the federal parliament is also becoming increasingly active. Hindenburg believes that this mixed system of dictatorship and parliamentary cabinet system can no longer be maintained. Therefore, Hindenburg no longer signs the alternative legal orders that Brüning deems necessary for the cabinet's measures. Now the right wing is determined to launch a major attack on the left wing, and the left-wing parties will soon be in a difficult situation unprecedented since World War I.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 30th – It is reported this evening that Brüning has declined the invitation to continue handling external affairs. Brüning not only said that he must temporarily detach himself from all political affairs, but also stated that he will not participate in any consultations at present. Brüning will leave Berlin for the south tomorrow for a long period of rest. The position of Chancellor is temporarily held by Vice-Chancellor Dietz.</p>
<h3 id="e109">President Receives Leaders of Various Parties <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 30th – The resignation of the Brüning Cabinet today has undoubtedly plunged Germany into a major political crisis. It is equally clear that President Hindenburg has no intention of deviating from the constitutional framework in resolving this political crisis. After accepting the resignation, the President received Reichstag President, Social Democratic Party member Löbe, and spoke with him for a long time. He then received the leader of the Social Democratic Party, the party with the most members in the Reichstag, Breitscheid, followed by National Socialist Party leader Hitler, who was accompanied by Deputy Party Leader Göring. These procedures all followed precedent. It is expected that he will continue to follow precedent tomorrow by receiving the leaders of parties with fewer seats. Only the Communist Party, because it is considered to be outside the constitution, is unlikely to be received by the President, and its key figures are also expected to have no intention of meeting with the President. No official announcement has been made regarding the content of the two talks today, but it is heard that the President stressed the need for a well-organized and consolidated party cabinet, and declared that during his tenure, he will strictly abide by the constitution and not allow any lapse. However, given the current situation, even a cabinet with a majority in the parliament may not be able to completely avoid using emergency decrees.</p>
<h3 id="e110">The Incompatibility of Left and Right Wings <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Another dispatch – It is heard that the President has expressed his hope that the political leaders can deeply understand this meaning and form a new cabinet within this week. However, judging from the current situation, whether a new cabinet can be formed quickly will depend entirely on whether the National Socialist Party and the Catholic Centre Party can abandon their suspicions and cooperate. If the two parties do not cooperate, it will not be possible to form a strong right-wing government in the current parliament. However, political circles feel quite skeptical about the possibility of cooperation between the two parties. This is because Brüning has refused to serve as Foreign Minister in the new cabinet and insists that he cannot hold any position in the new cabinet, which shows that the two factions may not be able to cooperate temporarily. From the perspective of the National Socialist Party, it also does not seem to want to cooperate with the Catholic Centre Party in the current parliament. The party is now striving to argue that the current parliament cannot represent the true will of the voters and demands dissolution and re-election. Therefore, there is little chance of success in forming a cabinet supported by a majority of members in the current parliament.</p>

<p>Another dispatch – It is now expected that the path that the German President will take in the future will be to form a temporary cabinet for transition, while dissolving the parliament and holding elections. This transitional cabinet may be organized by conservative leader Count Westarp. In addition, potential successors to the Chancellor include former Minister of Defence Gessler, Ambassador to Turkey Neurath, and Counts Gehr and Austern. Gehr and Austern are both well-known leaders of the Agrarian League, and both oppose the new emergency decree and the proposal to confiscate part of the land of large landowners and allocate it to the unemployed for cultivation, supporting President Hindenburg's position. Gehr is currently the East Prussian representative in the Federal Council and is a conservative figure.</p>

<p>Re-election of State Parliaments</p>
<p>National Socialist Party Wins Big</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 29th – The preliminary report of today's election for the German Hindenburg State Parliament has lived up to expectations. The influence of the National Socialist Party has greatly increased, with the number of votes obtained increasing by one-third compared to the second round of the presidential election a few days ago. The number of votes for all other parties has decreased. In the previous parliament, the National Socialist Party and the National People's Party, after their union, were only three seats short of a majority. It is now expected that they will definitely exceed a majority this time, and the Hindenburg government will be controlled by the National Socialist Party.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 30th – In yesterday's election for the German Hindenburg State Parliament, the National Socialist Party unexpectedly won 24 out of the 46 seats, becoming the majority party. This major victory of the National Socialist Party is likely related to the resignation of the Brüning Cabinet. Because Brüning, seeing this result, deeply knew that the tide of National Socialism was unstoppable and should no longer be prevented from assuming the reins of power.</p>

<p>Reuters, Berlin, 31st – The situation after the resignation of the Brüning government is extremely serious and will have a major impact on all of Europe. This is because Germany is like a rudderless ship adrift as the Lausanne Conference is about to open. It is generally expected that the new government will have a nationalist flavor, with the National Socialist Party wielding control. Party leader Hitler will be elected as Chancellor, and the political crisis will last for some time. It is difficult to predict what will happen next. What can be said with certainty is that Germany will not have a revolutionary civil war, and the political crisis can be resolved peacefully. If the Lausanne Conference fails, the power of the National Socialist Party will permeate the entire country after the parliament is dissolved and a general election is held. Hindenburg summoned Hitler to discuss the situation yesterday afternoon after receiving the leader of the Socialist Party.</p>

<p>British Prime Minister Hopes for Expanded Scope of Agenda</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 30th – British Prime Minister MacDonald told a reporter from the Daily Mail in his hometown of Lossiemouth that the British government representatives attending the Lausanne Reparations Conference will vigorously advocate that not only should the issues of debt and reparations be considered, but also the larger issue of the slump in international trade. This is an international event that cannot be solved by a single country. He hopes that the Lausanne Conference can deal with this matter in all aspects with perseverance. He intends to go to Lausanne in person because the matters handled at the conference are very important to the future of the British economy.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 31st – The State Department confirmed the claim that the United States will not participate in the Lausanne Reparations Conference on June 16. According to a statement here, the United States is not involved in reparations. No matter what Germany does, it still hopes that the debtor countries will fulfill their obligations. However, if the European countries agree on a solution to the reparations, the United States may be prepared to consider proposals regarding its debts.</p>

<p>Do Not Be Overconfident in Military Strength and Make a Big Mistake</p>
<p>British and American Political Circles Worry About Conflict Between Japan and Russia</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 31st – Soviet Russian government newspapers and Communist Party newspapers both published articles today, issuing a stern warning to Japan's threatening attitude, saying that Japan is arbitrarily conducting significant propaganda, preparing to attack Soviet Russia in order to seize the Far East and Eastern Siberia. The Soviet newspaper said that the Japanese imperialist newspapers are not enough to threaten the Soviet Union. Japanese imperialists have already reached Siberia at the cost of hundreds of millions of rubles and bloodshed. If these people allow Japan to act rashly again, there will be major disadvantages. The Communist Party newspaper said that the Japanese who are planning to wage war against Russia are very wrong, because they are too confident in their own strength. If these people want to realize their propaganda, the sacrifice will be great. Reuters, London, 20th – Informed sources in major capitals such as London and Washington are increasingly worried about the possibility of a conflict between Russia and Japan. This matter is currently being discussed in diplomatic circles. This worry can be seen in the following developments: Britain and the United States have recently suddenly accelerated the convening of the Shanghai Round Table Conference in order to discuss the status of Shanghai from an international perspective, and perhaps discuss Sino-Japanese disputes, and France and Italy have also expressed their agreement. It is expected that the United States' concept of the conference will be based on the Nine-Power Treaty or the Washington Treaty, and the League of Nations resolution will be secondary. But Russia is neither a member of the League of Nations nor has it signed the Nine-Power Treaty.</p>

<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 31st – The Seiyukai and Minseito parties almost broke up over the distribution of the position of Parliamentary Vice-Minister of Home Affairs. The Prime Minister twice asked Home Minister Yamamoto to appoint a member of the Seiyukai to the position, but Yamamoto refused and threatened to resign. The Minister of Education and the Minister of Railways, both members of the Seiyukai, also said that if a member of the Minseito Party held this position, they would all resign. Later, Seiyukai President Suzuki intervened and resolved the matter by listening to the Prime Minister's decision. The Seiyukai then issued an article stating that the Seiyukai made this decision for the sake of peace and tranquility. If it were not so, the downfall of the cabinet would have been almost inevitable.</p>

<p>Says that for the past few years, it has been military governance, not party governance</p>
<p>Strongly Rejects the Misconception that Military Power is Above All Else</p>
<p>Hu Hanmin, a member of the Standing Committee of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang, recently published a speech on the issue of the party, explaining the true meaning of party governance in detail. Based on past facts, he judged that what has been implemented since the 17th year of the Republic (1928) is the consistent warlord rule since the Republic of China, not party governance. Finally, he concluded that in order to seek national salvation, we must first save the party, saying that without this, there will be no way to continue the great cause of the revolution and save the country from its crisis. His words are extremely poignant. The full text of the speech clearly indicates his personal aspirations for the future, so we record it as follows:</p>
<p>"Recently, some people in the country, in view of the loss of sovereignty and humiliation in diplomacy, and the increasingly deteriorating political situation, blaming the imminent demise of the country on party governance, believing that the country's affairs have reached this point due to the overzealous implementation of party governance in the past five years. Therefore, in the future, if we want to resolve the country's crisis and extend the life of the nation, we must overthrow party governance. There seem to be many who advocate this view, and even some comrades within the party occasionally use it as a basis to express their views. We believe that in the past few years, the country's affairs have been so ruined that the Chinese Kuomintang, which bears the historical mission of revolution, cannot shirk its responsibility. However, if we attribute it to the fault of implementing party governance, then we, from the party's standpoint, feel that it is inappropriate. From an objective point of view, we dare not agree. In the past five years, what has been vigorously implemented without change and even with increase is the so-called warlord rule that has been consistent since the Republic of China, and there has never been so-called party governance. We are well aware that our party adheres to the Three Principles of the People and leads the national revolution. Its fundamental policy is to seek China's freedom and independence externally, and to eliminate the remnants of warlords internally in order to seek China's unification and construction. For decades, we have persisted in this effort, enduring all kinds of hardships and failures without yielding, and finally overthrew the Manchu autocracy in the past and eliminated the Northern Warlords, leading to the completion of unification in the 17th year of the Republic (1928). Therefore, whether from the perspective of our party's principles or our party's history, we must rely on our party's above-mentioned policies, implement our party's revolutionary propositions, shoulder our party's historical mission, and place China in the realm of freedom, independence, unification, and construction. Only then can we say that we are implementing party governance. We believe that anyone who respects historical facts and objective understanding should have no objection to this view. However, the facts of the past five years are not the case. In practice, because military power is above all else, a phenomenon of military control over politics and political control over the party has formed, causing everything to be centered on one person. Revolution is carried out to achieve the goal of eliminating obstacles, and it is unavoidable to emphasize military affairs. However, this is a temporary strategy, not a long-term constant rule. Unfortunately, once the obstacles are removed, those who wield military power still regard military power as the highest authority. Therefore, since the 17th year of the Republic (1928), although the Northern Warlord forces in various provinces have been broken, the people are still ruled by military force as before. The environment that created warlord politics for the past 20 years is still the same. The so-called warlord rule that has been consistent since Yuan Shikai has continued as before. A part of our party's unscrupulous comrades have failed to understand the great meaning of revolution and examine the task of revolution, and have also ruined their revolutionary standpoint, indulging in the fallacy of "whoever has the gun has the power," willing to be appendages of the military, increasing the momentum of the warlords, and the spirit of the party has been increasingly lost, and the great cause of the revolution has been increasingly ruined. Therefore, judging from the facts of the past few years, our party has never been able to implement its policies for even a day because the warlords are an obstacle. With military power as the center of politics, political tutelage cannot begin, and construction cannot proceed. The people's freedom and rights have been wantonly destroyed, and party affairs have been centered on military power. The spirit of democratic centralism has been completely destroyed, and the power centered on individuals has been expanding day by day. We only see individuals who use the party for personal gain, and we do not see comrades who devote themselves to the revolution. So-called party members either take everything from the party, using the party as a parasite, or rely on the party to do evil and commit adultery, to the party as cunning and deceitful, enjoying being used by these people to give their directions. They further distort the meaning of the party, create factions, buy off private individuals, and seize party power. The fallacy of (the individual is the party) is also fully displayed. I once heard a certain party leader say that the comrades before the 16th year of the Republic (1927) all have a history with the party, so they are only used as decorations. Recruiting party members must be qualified from those after the 16th year of the Republic (1927), because these people have no history with the party and are easy to control. Openly speaking without reservation, their private factions and private cliques, for the sake of protecting personal interests, would rather sacrifice the whole country for personal desires. To the point that even among the same cadre members, those who flatter can survive, while those who uphold justice will be rejected. Therefore, anyone with strict opinions, if they differ from the powerful, will be followed by the disaster of detention, exile, and slaughter. The original comrades have been repeatedly rejected and diminished day by day, and new party members have been increasing day by day because they tend to be narrow-minded and cunning. The elements are complicated, and the party's ideology and history are unknown, only as warlord lackeys, immersed in the evil habits of fighting and fighting. For the past five years, we have only seen individuals and not the party. Therefore, there are no party resolutions within the party, and the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters has mountains of proposals, but they are just empty words. All measures come from personal selfish intentions. There is no collective will, nor is there collective action. The face of the party is completely changed, so that people outside the party do not know what our party's ideology and policy are, and what the party members are striving for. (To be continued)"</p>

<p>Japanese Residents' Property Also Confiscated</p>
<p>Osaka Asahi Shimbun, Tsuruga Dispatch: According to information from the Amakusa Maru, the Vladivostok Soviet Russian Political Security Department has recently been severely oppressing Japanese residents. Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha and the Vladivostok branch of International Transportation have been sealed off, and all employees have returned home via Chongjin. All Eurasian liaison cargo passing through the Siberian Railway has also been cut off. All Japanese residents have been expelled and returned home. More than fifty remaining Japanese residents have retreated to Manchuria one after another. The private property of Japanese residents, which they had painstakingly managed in the port for more than twenty years, has been completely confiscated by the Soviet Russian Political Department. When Japanese residents leave the country, they are not allowed to carry any items other than enough for travel expenses, so Japanese residents are all weeping and swallowing their voices and leaving. The principal of the Japanese elementary school in the area, Kentaro Muramatsu, was also forced into exile. The school has long been closed. For other Japanese residents who have married Russian women, the Political Security Department absolutely does not allow the Russian women to leave the country, so the marriages of Japanese residents have all been broken up.</p>

<p>Osaka Asahi Shimbun, Washington Special Dispatch: The United States is paying close attention to the situation in the Far East after the assassination of Inukai Tsuyoshi. The US government believes that the Shanghai ceasefire agreement has failed to resolve the dangerous situation, and the power of the Japanese government has fallen into the hands of stubborn soldiers, so it is inevitable that there will be major conflicts between all countries and the Soviet government.

If war breaks out between Japan and Russia, the United States will refuse to supply weapons to both countries, and its attitude is apparent.</p>

<p>Changsha Correspondence: He Jian, Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government and Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth Route Army, recently secretly ordered military police to shut down the Hunan Student Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association and declared temporary martial law. As a result, students were unable to take to the streets to conduct inspections on the morning of the 26th. However, at 3:00 PM that afternoon, He Jian convened a meeting of all members of the Provincial Federation of Commerce, the Changsha Chamber of Commerce, and the People's Anti-Japanese Association to explain the reasons for shutting down the student association. He also stated that even stricter measures would be needed to continue the inspections under the auspices of the People's Anti-Japanese Association. That evening, the People's Anti-Japanese Association also held an emergency meeting, deciding to hold a general inspection starting on the 27th. Registered enemy goods would be allowed to be sold in designated sections, while unregistered enemy goods would be confiscated and severely punished. By the evening of the 28th, the inspection was completed, with only a small amount of unregistered enemy goods discovered. It was initially thought that this matter could be considered settled, but the students absolutely refused to accept the closure of the student Anti-Japanese Association and demanded that the government reopen it by June 1st. They also firmly insisted that the general inspection continue to be conducted by students. The Provincial Party Headquarters also supported the students and demanded that the government reopen the student association. However, the Provincial Government, concerned about its credibility, found it difficult to accept this request. This dispute between commerce and students is now shifting into a dispute between students and the government. The current situation between the students and the Provincial Government is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Students Question He Jian: All executive committee members of the Student Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association presented a statement to He Jian on the 27th, saying, "Having read the orders published in various newspapers regarding Your Excellency's closure of the Hunan Student Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, we are deeply shocked. (Omission) We respectfully present our points of concern with tears in our eyes. (1) Since serving in the Student Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, we have absolutely obeyed the orders of superiors and sincerely accepted the guidance of the Party and government, without ever acting presumptuously. This time, the preparation for the general inspection of enemy goods was entirely in accordance with the decisions of superiors and had been submitted for approval and subsidies were issued. As for the inspection date, it was invariably based on the will of the superiors, and there was no indication of non-acceptance. Moreover, Liu Zeyuan, director of the economic severance department of the People's Anti-Japanese Association, was invited to serve as the general commander of this inspection. This shows that we have absolutely no intention of disrupting</p>
<p>Therefore, in Your Excellency's order, the so-called 'disobeying the orders of superiors, taking independent action, and disregarding Party discipline and the law' is entirely baseless. This is the first thing we do not understand. (2) Your Excellency's order states, 'Calling on students throughout the city to inspect house by house, ostensibly in the name of patriotism, but secretly engaging in sabotage,' etc. We believe that this general inspection originated from the students' conscience and also followed the orders of superiors, without any other intention. The facts are clear. The so-called 'secretly engaging in sabotage,' we do not know on what basis it is based. This is the second thing we do not understand. (3) Your Excellency's order includes the phrase 'severely punish the ringleaders.' Who are the ringleaders being referred to? We urge you to immediately investigate and arrest them. If it is all of us, then please arrest and prosecute us all together. Moreover, during the closure this time, we were all personally present and no one was arrested. This is the third thing we do not understand. The above three points are what we cannot understand no matter how hard we think. Therefore, we respectfully request Your Excellency to provide detailed instructions to dispel doubts. Furthermore, the closure of the Student Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association this time has left the students unclear about the truth and extremely indignant. We are not responsible for any future expressions. If you fear that we will incite unrest, please temporarily detain us or send personnel to monitor us at any time to avoid suspicion. This is respectfully and cautiously submitted." At the same time, a similar statement was sent to the Provincial Party Headquarters, and a public letter to compatriots was issued, criticizing the Provincial Government.</p>
<p>He Jian Responds to the Student Association: He Jian replied to the Student Association's questions on the 28th, stating, "Your statement is noted. This city's general inspection of enemy goods was decided in principle by the Hunan People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, submitted to superiors for instructions, and approved to be carried out by the People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association after June 1st. Instructions were also given to draft inspection methods and submit them for approval. Therefore, this inspection work should be planned and handled by the People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, and the inspection period and methods should also be in accordance with the decisions of superiors, which is undoubtedly the case. The association's determination to share the same hatred is commendable, and it should have a thorough understanding of this principle. However, due to emotions overriding reason, it initially decided to hold the inspection independently and then insisted on holding it on the 26th of this month, which was already suspected of disobeying the orders of superiors and disrupting the system. Later, after repeated resolutions by senior cadres and various meetings of the People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, it was decided to hold the inspection on the 27th of this month. The association had representatives present at all meetings and cannot claim ignorance. While the higher-level meetings were doing their best to adopt the association's opinions, the association arbitrarily summoned students from various schools to gather at Zhongshan Hall at 7:00 AM on the 26th to begin the inspection. This can be verified by the association's report to the Garrison Headquarters and the secret orders and slogans issued to various schools. Such disregard for the decisions of superiors and independent action clearly violates Party discipline and the law. Although the association's original intention was to eliminate enemy goods, at this time of intense suppression of Communism, it could easily cause social unrest. Even if the association had no other intentions, it cannot escape blame. Moreover, with the confrontation between commerce and students and the emergency situation, insisting on holding onto one's own prejudices and disregarding the public's peace and tranquility, how can one avoid the charge of sabotage? The government has the responsibility to protect peace and order. It has already strictly prohibited merchants from taking self-defense measures, and it cannot but suppress the association's actions that endanger public security. In short, everyone sympathizes with resisting Japan and saving the nation. The government and society deeply cherish the association's leadership of students in their efforts to save the nation, but we cannot bear to allow it to overstep the bounds and lead to a crisis. This is why we have taken the action of closing it down. The points raised in the statement are truly ignorant of the facts. As for the enemy goods in this city, they must be eliminated to effectively achieve economic severance. The People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association is currently conducting a thorough inspection, and the government has ordered the city's Chamber of Commerce to instruct merchants in various industries to issue pledges not to purchase enemy goods again as a measure to get to the root of the problem. There is absolutely no reason to allow any leniency. The executive committee members' pure hearts and minds are well known, and they must inform the students of various schools to study peacefully and devote themselves to the proper path of patriotism. Do not let momentary anger weaken your determination to share the same hatred. We have high hopes for you."</p>
<p>Emergency Meeting of Student Representatives: Students from public and private schools were extremely dissatisfied with the Provincial Government's closure of the Student Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association. Therefore, each school nominated ten representatives to hold an emergency meeting of student representatives from various schools at Zhongshan Hall at 6:00 PM on the 28th to discuss countermeasures. More than 300 people attended. Huang Jiasheng, Peng Guojun, Zhu Haohuai, and Huang Xigong, four members of the Provincial Party Headquarters, also attended the meeting. The meeting was chaired by student He Qianyuan, and the following matters were decided: (1) In the name of the assembly, send a telegram expressing sincere support for the Hunan Student Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association and send letters of condolence to the executive committee members, urging them to continue their struggle. (2) This assembly swears to defend the Hunan Student Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association and obey orders to conduct a general inspection of enemy goods. (3) Submit a request to the Provincial Party Headquarters to forward to the Provincial Government, requesting that the Hunan Student Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association be reopened before June 1st. (4) Request the government to severely punish the unscrupulous merchants who disregard the law and use force to obstruct the general inspection. (5) Request the government to severely punish the pedantic politicians who collude with unscrupulous merchants, sow discord, fabricate accusations against young people, and attempt to undermine the anti-Japanese work. (6) Request the Provincial Party Headquarters to seal up the Wan Wan Bao newspaper, which fabricates facts and makes sensationalist statements, and severely punish its editors. (7) The resolutions of this assembly will be handled by the presidium. If there are difficulties in implementation or no results, the presidium will convene a second temporary representative assembly to discuss countermeasures. (May 29th)</p>

<p>Provincial Order to Enhance County Magistrate's Authority: The county government recently received a provincial order stating that at the 496th meeting of the Provincial Government Committee, a plan was discussed regarding measures to enhance the county magistrate's authority. A. Orders issued by the Prefectural and Provincial Offices should be processed by the county magistrate. The actions of various bureaus in implementing orders should all be reported to the county magistrate for approval. B. The heads of various county bureaus will still be appointed by the various provincial departments but will be subject to the direction and supervision of the county magistrate. Those who are at fault may be disciplined, and those who are incompetent may be dismissed by the county magistrate with a request to the provincial department. C. Various bureaus may not independently issue public notices to the outside. If a public notice must be issued, it should still be issued in the name of the county magistrate, countersigned by the bureau head. The above was discussed and approved for notification to various provincial departments and for implementation by various counties.</p>
<p>Police Squad Arrests Bandit Leader: Zhou A Jin (also known as Tailor A Jin), a bandit from the old gang of Tai Bao A Shu, was operating in the Western Triangle area of Shanyang County. Wu Chengdu, the leader of the second squad of the county police force, discovered this. On the night of the 28th, he quietly led his squad to encircle and suppress the bandits. The bandit leader Zhou A Jin was captured on the spot, and the remaining bandits escaped.</p>

<p>Petition to Retain the 19th Route Army: The dispatch of the 19th Route Army to Kaijian to suppress bandits has been reported in this newspaper. The Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions has sent representatives to Suzhou to join with various circles in Suzhou to petition for the retention of the 19th Route Army. At 10:00 AM on the 30th, representatives from various circles in Suzhou were received. It was decided to establish the Wu County All-Circles Petition to Retain the Songhu Anti-Japanese Army Committee, with all attending representatives as ex officio members. At noon, all attending representatives, accompanied by the delegation from the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, went to the headquarters of the 19th Route Army to petition. Commander Cai personally received them. Representative Qiu Kun first stated the significance and purpose of the petition, requesting Commander Cai to convey it to Commander-in-Chief Chiang and submit it to the Central Government to avoid transferring the army. Representative Fang Zheng from the Shanghai Trade Union continued to state that if the purpose could not be achieved, the 800,000 workers in Shanghai were willing to sacrifice everything and gather on the tracks to prevent the departure of the army. Commander Cai stood up and said, "I am deeply grateful and ashamed for the enthusiasm of the representatives. However, the dispatch of our army to Fujian is an order from the Central Government. Soldiers take obedience as their duty and cannot violate it. Moreover, the banditry in Fujian has affected the entire province. Our army is loved by the people, and it is difficult to choose between which is more important. If the Central Government could dispatch another army to Fujian to suppress the bandits, that would be great. I believe there will be no problem in the Songhu area." The County Chamber of Commerce also sent a telegram to the National Government Military Commission, earnestly requesting a temporary exemption from the transfer.</p>

<p>Clash Between Police and Civilians in Dexing: The Public Security Bureau, using the pretext of arresting gamblers, sent armed police to search the entire town of Dexing at the foot of Wolf Mountain, arousing public indignation and leading to a clash. The Public Security Bureau arrested six men and women, including the township head Tang Guangcong. On the 29th, the entire town went on strike, and the heads of towns and villages also resigned en masse. At 2:00 PM, more than a thousand villagers, holding incense, petitioned the county government. County Magistrate Zhang promised to investigate thoroughly and handle the matter according to law. The Director of the Public Security Bureau, Wu Yizeng, reported to the county government that several policemen had been beaten and injured and requested that the ringleaders be investigated. The unrest is escalating, and it is unknown how it will end.</p>
<p>Correction: Telegram from Nanchang, respectfully addressed to the chief editor of the Shen Bao. I recently saw a Nanchang dispatch published on the second page of your newspaper on the 27th regarding the Guangdong Army withdrawing to Guangdong, which is inconsistent with the facts. The Guangdong Army, led by Commander Yu Hanmou, is currently jointly suppressing the Peng bandits with the Hunan and Jiangxi armies in the Gannan, Shangyou, and Chongyi areas and has achieved repeated victories. This dispatch is not factual. I am sincerely afraid of repeated rumors and request your newspaper to correct it.

<h3 id="e126">Newspaper Workers' General Strike Today <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Opposing the "Shishi Xinbao" Newspaper's Dismissal of a Large Number of Workers</p>
<p>Supporting Workers Forced to Leave the "Shishi Xinbao" Newspaper</p>
<p>The labor dispute at the "Shishi Xinbao" newspaper, which has long attracted social attention, has lasted for two months since it occurred on April 2nd. Various community groups have repeatedly mediated, but due to the newspaper's firm stance,</p>
<p>Without any concession, it has led to this strike. Now the "Shen Bao," "Xinwen Bao," and "Shishi Xinbao" newspapers in Shanghai have unanimously joined in, and the situation is quite serious. The details are listed as follows:</p>
<p>Cause of the Labor Dispute: On April 2nd of this year, the "Shishi Xinbao" newspaper's management forced the newspaper's workers to concurrently print the "Da Wan Bao" newspaper. (Note: The "Da Wan Bao" newspaper is sponsored by Zhang Zhuping, chairman of the "Shishi Xinbao" board of directors, and has its own printing equipment. It has been published for two months. There is no need for the "Shishi Xinbao" newspaper to print it on its behalf. It is actually a tool for provocation. Because the newspaper's management knew that the labor union would not agree, it used this as a pretext to lock down the factory and force the newspaper's workers to leave, in order to achieve its goal of undermining the labor movement.) At that time, the newspaper's workers politely refused because the labor union had regulations that one newspaper should not print two newspapers. They immediately reported to the labor union for instructions. The labor union immediately sent a committee member, Zhang Baokang, to explain everything to the newspaper's management. Unexpectedly, a newspaper employee (actually not an employee, but the newspaper's registered lawyer) came forward to argue. First, there was a verbal conflict, then Committee Member Zhang was beaten and insulted, and his clothes were torn. At the same time, a large number of police officers were instigated to arrest Committee Member Zhang. At that time, under the strong protection of a large number of workers, he was able to escape. Therefore, the newspaper's workers went to the labor union to report the incident. The "Shishi Xinbao" newspaper's management took the opportunity to lock down the factory while a group of workers were leaving the factory, refusing to allow them to work, and announced that all the newspaper's workers would be dismissed.</p>
<p>Negotiation Process: After learning that the "Shishi Xinbao" newspaper dismissed all its workers, the newspaper labor union immediately sent representatives to the newspaper's management to make a serious representation. Because the newspaper was determined to undermine the labor union, it initially demanded that the labor union dismiss Committee Member Zhang Baokang and order all workers to fill out a statement of willingness before allowing them to work. The labor union believed that since the labor union had previously signed a labor-management agreement with the newspaper, and both sides had been able to abide by it, the newspaper's dismissal of all workers for no reason violated the labor-management agreement and was an attempt to undermine the labor union. There was no result and the meeting broke up. After this, the postal service, distribution, and private individuals came forward to mediate with the management, but there was no result. It has been two months since this incident occurred, leading to the general strike of the "Shen Bao," "Xinwen Bao," and "Shishi Xinbao" newspapers to support the workers.</p>
<p>Strike Declaration: All oppressed workers and compatriots in China, in recent years, the lives of us workers have been affected by many complex political and economic factors, and we have been suffering beyond description. Since the "September 18th" Manchurian Incident, Chinese capitalists have repeatedly retreated and not resisted the aggression and oppression of Japanese imperialism. However, they have adopted a proactive strategy towards us workers, who are cold and hungry. They, the capitalists, use "resisting Japan and saving the country" and "promoting domestic goods," "increasing production" as an excuse to intensify their exploitation. Only despicable capitalists will implement such shameless and cruel methods, and only we Chinese workers will deeply suffer from such a tragic fate.</p>
<p>After the "January 28th" Shanghai Incident, the entire Shanghai became a battlefield, and all production organs completely tended to</p>
<p>Suspension. The majority of our Shanghai workers were homeless and destitute. A large number of laborers suddenly increased in the vast labor market. Therefore, the clever capitalists took this opportunity to increase unemployment and lay off the original organized or higher-wage workers, and hired new unorganized and lower-wage workers to satisfy their insatiable greed. Therefore, we workers were both brutally killed by the Japanese imperialists and further exploited by the Chinese capitalists. Under this dual severe pressure, even the strength to groan and struggle disappeared.</p>
<p>This kind of fact was first implemented by the capitalists of the "Shishi Xinbao" newspaper, who assumed the responsibility of "leading society," and the workers who worked all day in the "cultural industry" were also the first to be poisoned by it. Before the outbreak of the "January 28th" Incident, the "Minguo Ribao" newspaper was sealed up by the imperialists because it published anti-Japanese news. However, the management of the "Minguo Ribao" newspaper repeatedly succumbed to the oppression of the imperialists and even admitted to its "temporary suspension," but did not care about the fact that the imperialists' cannons were still attacking us fiercely and ruthlessly laid off the workers of the "Minguo Ribao" newspaper, causing the workers of the "Minguo Ribao" newspaper to be displaced and destitute. In less than two months, the capitalists of the "Shishi Xinbao" newspaper also came up with a novel idea, using the issue of printing the "Da Wan Bao" newspaper as a pretext to openly undermine our labor union organization. Failing to undermine it, they implemented a mass layoff. Although some workers have been forced to go to work under the threat of bribery and coercion, there are still thirty or forty people who have refused to give in and refuse to go to work. The workers who have gone to work have silently surrendered under the power of the one or two workers bought by the management. The conspiracy of the "Shishi Xinbao" newspaper has been fully realized. But looking back at the lives of the dozens of workers who have not yet gone to work and looking forward to the future of our association, we feel extremely dangerous. Now, in order to protect our own vital interests and consolidate the foundation of the labor union, we have to make a final duel with the fierce and vicious capitalists of the "Shishi Xinbao" newspaper, and we have to lead all the newspaper workers to go on strike together to promote their awareness. We hope that all Chinese workers and compatriots will provide spiritual and material assistance at any time.</p>
<p>Strike Objectives: (1) All workers forced to leave the "Shishi Xinbao" newspaper must be reinstated. (2) The wages of the workers forced to leave the newspaper must be paid in full for the period they were out of work. (3) Compensation must be paid for all losses suffered by the labor union as a result of this incident. (4) The labor-management agreement previously signed between the labor union and the "Shishi Xinbao" newspaper remains valid.</p>
<p>Strike Order: For urgent notice, this association believes that the management of the "Shishi Xinbao" newspaper deliberately undermined the unity of this association and dismissed a large number of workers. Although this association has conducted peaceful negotiations for two months, it has not been able to obtain the understanding of the newspaper's management. It is now decided to declare a general strike of the "Shen Bao," "Xinwen Bao," and "Shishi Xinbao" newspapers from June 1st to promote the early resolution of the newspaper's management. All workers are required to abide by this order without fail. This is an urgent order.</p>
<p>Strike Discipline: (1) All members of this association must absolutely obey the orders of the strike committee after the strike. (2) Before receiving the strike committee's order to resume work, they must absolutely not resume work without authorization, otherwise they will be considered to have undermined the strike. (3) No acts of undermining the strike are allowed. (4) Do not spread rumors or incite people's minds. (5) Obey the command of the picket team. (6) Strictly maintain order. (7) Those who violate the discipline will be punished in the most severe way.</p>
<p>Public Announcement to All Circles: To all people from all walks of life, this association has been established for five years since its establishment in the 16th year of the Republic of China. The labor and management sides have signed an agreement, and both sides can abide by it and live in peace. However, on April 2nd of this year, the management of the "Shishi Xinbao" newspaper used the fact that it could not print the "Da Wan Bao" newspaper as an excuse, citing that this association interfered with the newspaper's administration, and dismissed all workers. This association and various community groups have repeatedly mediated and tried to get the workers to go back to work, but it has been ineffective. It has been two months since then. This association thinks that there is no hope for a peaceful solution, and the emotions of all members are excited and cannot be restrained. Therefore, we have no choice but to declare a general strike from today to promote the awareness of the newspaper and achieve the purpose of restoring the jobs of the workers who left the newspaper. This association has also considered that newspapers transmit domestic and foreign news and are indispensable for people from all walks of life, but for the sake of the interests of all newspaper workers in our association, it is impossible to have both, so we have no choice but to resort to this last resort. Therefore, this association is very sorry for the obstruction of the hearing of the social people. I hope that people from all walks of life will sympathize and help, so that this unfortunate [situation] can be resolved in the fastest possible time, then it will be fortunate.</p>
<p>Statement to Various Agencies: Report to the Municipal Government, Party Headquarters, and Social Affairs Bureau, stating, "Regarding the reporting of the matter, the Shishi Xinbao authorities, on April 2nd of this year, locked down the factory and dismissed a large number of workers on the pretext of the Da Wan Bao incident, hoping to undermine the organization of the subordinate association. This has been reported in the case repeatedly. However, for two months, various community groups have run around to mediate, but in the end, the attitude of the museum is tough and there is no sincerity, so it has not been resolved yet. All members of the subordinate association think that there is no hope for a peaceful solution, and the feelings of the public are excited and cannot be restrained. Now, because it is forced to, a general strike is announced from today to promote the awareness of the museum, and I sincerely ask the chiefs of the 'association and bureau' to uphold justice and pass on the matter to the workers who were forced to leave, so that they can resume work as soon as possible. I am waiting for your orders. June 1st, the eleventh year of the Republic of China. Educational news highlights</p>

<h3 id="e128">Explanation of Jiangsu Education Department's Prohibition of Teaching Strikes and Salary Demands <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Preventing the Use of Salary Demands as a Pretext to Stir Up Educational Unrest</p>
<p>Since the Jiangsu Education Department issued a clear order prohibiting elementary school teachers and staff from going on strike to demand salaries, there has been much suspicion from the outside world regarding this instruction. In order to understand the truth, the reporter went to the Education Department to inquire about opinions from the responsible personnel. They provided separate explanations as follows:</p>
<p>The motivation for this department's prohibition of teaching strikes and salary demands is due to the fact that trouble makers in the education circles of various counties often use the name of demanding arrears to carry out acts of surrounding [authorities], causing educational unrest, which makes it impossible for educational administrative authorities to handle daily affairs, and even causes a state of unease in the education of the entire county. Therefore, it is necessary to strictly prohibit them, and it is not to force elementary school teachers to teach on an empty stomach, nor is it to cancel all arrears at all, as the outside world says, depriving them of their due rights or hindering their livelihoods. As for the issue of clearing the salary arrears of elementary school teachers, this department is planning to separately clean up the arrears. Regarding this level, it should be divided into old arrears and new arrears. The old arrears are probably caused by long-term overspending and erosion, and it is impossible to handle them clearly in a short period of time. We are currently tracking down and recovering the educational funds that have been misappropriated or misused over the years. Once we have a certain amount, we will gradually pay them back. On the one hand, we are trying our best to prevent new arrears from occurring. The first measure is to strictly prohibit overspending, so we have recently carefully reviewed the budgets of various counties and implemented a principle of balanced income and expenditure. If we can implement it, and if there are no unexpected events, there should be no more arrears of salaries. This department will never ignore the hardship of elementary school teachers' lives and the excessive arrears of salaries, and we are constantly thinking about ways to clear them. For example, in this reorganization of Jiangdu education, on the one hand, we are replacing derelict officials, but on the other hand, we are still using all methods to strictly pursue the old debts from those who refuse to write [acknowledgements]. We are also formulating methods for collecting and disbursing education funds in the future. However, it is difficult to reverse the accumulated problems, and it is not possible to fundamentally and completely reorganize them in a short period of time. If elementary school teachers are really forced by livelihood and make legitimate appeals, this department will certainly examine the actual situation and urge the administrative authorities of various counties to properly plan for relief. If the education authorities of various counties have acts of dereliction of duty or private gain, once this department detects them, we will definitely enforce the law to wrap them up. If the people of various counties have any opinions, they can provide evidence and submit a written report according to the complaint procedures. This department will also handle it according to law without any favoritism. In short, this department's move is to prevent the troublemaking of unscrupulous elements, and it is not initially to ignore the hardship of the livelihood of elementary school teachers and arbitrarily oppress them, nor is it to erase all the previous salary arrears. The words of the outside world, such as "only officials are allowed to set fires, but the people are not allowed to light lamps," are really misunderstandings. I sincerely hope that you will explain the intention of this department on our behalf, etc.</p>

<p>"Once the school opens, there will be nowhere to burn incense." This is Old Xu's hypnotic trick to fool women. How anxious I am! If the old ladies and young mistresses believe his words and join the group opposing us, we will be completely defeated. I was thinking with my eyes closed about countermeasures to resist.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I heard a voice shouting "Chairman!" I saw that plump old lady Song was about to speak. Grandma Wu, who was sitting in front of her, also shouted "Chairman!" Sister-in-law Wang Er pulled on Grandma Wu's clothes and gently said to her, "Zhong'er said that two people cannot speak at the same time. Wait for Old Lady Song to speak, and then you can speak." Grandma Wu sat down. What a patient and persuasive Sister-in-law Wang Er! Grandma Wu's willingness to take advice is also unmatched. Compare that to those adults and gentlemen who break each other's heads with inkstones, how different! Who says our rural civil rights will cause trouble? Old Lady Song usually likes to help the poor and enjoys great prestige in the village, and has significant influence. I was anxious to hear her opinion. She said: "Counseling them not to listen blindly to Zhong'er's nonsense, I am now coming out to respond as an old lady. We all have eyes, and our ears are not deaf either. How can you call it blindly listening? Although Zhong'er is young, he is also a person. Why are his words nonsense? Opening a school is not limited to destroying the Buddha. Why is there nowhere to burn incense? This old woman wants to worship Buddha, and her grandchildren want to go to school. Holding school in the Buddha hall, we can watch the children study while burning incense. It can be said that it is doubly convenient and couldn't be better. I oppose Brother Xu's suggestion."</p>
<p>The chairman called on Grandma Wu to speak. Grandma Wu said, "Everything I wanted to say has already been said by Old Lady Song. I support opening a school and not destroying the Buddha."</p>
<p>After the discussion was over, the chairman put it to a vote. Only Old Xu raised a hand to oppose the opening of the school. One hand! How lonely that was! The most interesting thing was the owner of the grocery store. Because not destroying the Buddha does no harm to his business of gold foil and incense paper, he didn't care about Old Xu's loneliness either.</p>
<p>The next item discussed was the qualifications of the teacher. Everyone agreed that they should hire the very best and most capable person to be the teacher. As for what is considered the very best and most capable, you only need to look at the records of that day to understand what kind of teacher our villagers ideally had in mind:</p>
<p>Zhang Huzi said, "The teacher must be proficient in the Four Books and Five Classics. Eight-legged essays are useless now. He must be able to write essays on current affairs." Yu Laowu, who had recently lost a lawsuit, said, "It's best to understand the law." Zhu Laotai, who was looking for a wife for her son everywhere, said, "He should be able to match horoscopes and write invitation cards. That would be convenient." Ding Laowu, who was planning to buy land, said, "He must be a teacher who can write deeds."</p>
<p>Old Lady Song, who was experienced and afraid that Zhang Huzi would interfere and also afraid of fashionable teachers from the city, said, "We want to hire a 'five-no' teacher: one who doesn't skip class, two who doesn't smoke, three who doesn't gamble, four who doesn't let 'drizzling rain' fall, and five who doesn't say 'my dear sister, I love you...'" She spoke freely and unrestrainedly, causing everyone to burst into laughter.</p>
<p>I think finding a graduate from a good normal school or above can meet all of these requirements. Finally, everyone passed the motion to find a normal school graduate who meets the above qualifications to be the teacher.</p>
<p>Remuneration was also discussed. Everyone would take turns providing meals. Each student would send gifts for the three main festivals, ranging from one to two yuan per festival, with the very poor being exempt from sending gifts. Temple funds would be used for equipment expenses.</p>
<p>Brother Chun Sheng, Old Lady Song, and I were elected as members of the preparatory committee, responsible for finding a teacher who is the very best and most capable.</p>

<p>Track and Field Seeks Decisive Victory over the US, Germany, and Finland</p>
<p>Swimming Hopes to Overpower the United States and Seize the Championship</p>
<p>Should Our National Authorities Be Alerted?</p>
<p>This article is an English manuscript written by Mr. Kyo Kutsushi, a Japanese, originally titled "Japan's Athletic Forces Preparing to Invade US For Olympiad." The article is very long. The following is an abridged translation, offered to our national authorities and the sports community, to see if they can be alerted to self-motivate themselves. -Translator's Postscript</p>
<p>The 10th World Olympic Games will be held in Los Angeles, California, USA, from July 31st to August 14th. Japan is currently actively preparing for joint training. Approximately 140 people will attend the Games. It is also planned that after the closing ceremony, from August 15th, the Japanese team will invite athletes from other countries to hold a quadrangular track and field competition in San Francisco. Germany has decided to join, and the United States and Britain are also expected to participate. At the same time, Finnish athletes will also tour Japan and Europe at that time. After they arrive in Japan, they will also hold competitive matches. Therefore, Japanese athletes are very proud and have great hopes and interests.</p>
<p>A Brief History of Japan's Participation in the World Games: Japan's participation in the World Olympic Games dates back 20 years. However, at that time, new-era sports such as track and field were immature. Only fencing, wrestling, and boxing were included. In the past 20 years, new-era sports have been vigorously promoted and gradually expanded. Now they are surprisingly dominating the world stage. When the 6th World Games were held in Stockholm in 1912, only two people were sent to participate. This was the first time Japanese athletes appeared on the world stage. At the Swedish Games in 1920, the number of Japanese athletes attending increased to 15. At the French Games in 1924, the number of athletes suddenly doubled, reaching as many as 30. In these past Games, Japanese athletes have gradually shown their talent. Although they did not score many points, they attracted the attention of major sports powers. By the time of the Dutch Games in 1928, the number of Japanese athletes had exceeded 50. They also created great new world records, proudly boasting to people of all countries, which made people gasp. For example, Oda Mikio won the triple jump championship and set a new world record with a score of 15.58 meters.</p>
<p>The Content of the Team: Among the 140 Japanese athletes, many are world record holders. Therefore, their strength is sufficient, far surpassing that of the past. There are a total of 30 or 40 people in the team, including managers, coaches, and attendants. The Japanese Sports Association has invited Mr. Morita Toshihiko as the general team leader. The athletes are divided into track and field, marathon, swimming, diving, rowing, boxing, and equestrianism. Among them, track and field and swimming are the strongest. The triple jump and long jump in track and field are both world record holders. In addition, there are seven new national records. In terms of swimming, the confidence is strongest. There are seven great achievements that were created last year when the top American swimming team competed against Japan. At that time, the head coach of the American swimming team visiting Japan was Yale University coach Robert Kiphuth, who is also the head coach of the American swimming team at this year's World Games. Mr. Kiphuth was surprised and astonished by the outstanding swimming performance of the Japanese team.</p>
<p>Learning from Others: Japan, in view of the importance of international sports competitions, is working hard to encourage and reward athletes, and invites world-renowned experts to perform in Japan, borrowing from others to correct its own mistakes. For example, American sprint star Simpson, and Stanford University's shot put and discus champion Harold Robert, were invited to perform in Japan. Other examples include the American National Baseball All-Star Team, the German Track and Field Team, and French tennis players, all of whom have visited Japan one after another. In recent years, Japan has also repeatedly sent track and field, baseball, golf, and other athletes to compete in various countries, so as to investigate the sports methods of various countries and promote their own. Therefore, the excitement and success of the Japanese sports community in the world sports arena is not accidental.</p>

<h3 id="e138">Yesterday's Joint Committee Plenary Meeting <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Yu Hongjun Refutes the Cause</p>
<p>The Garrison in Longhua is Our Sovereignty</p>
<p>Why Should the Japanese Interfere Unreasonably?</p>
<p>The Garrison Headquarters, considering that there was no garrison in the Songnan area and that local security was extremely dangerous, specially petitioned the Military Department to dispatch a company of military police to be responsible for defense some days ago. Unexpectedly, the Japanese military authorities requested the Joint Committee to hold a meeting, intending to interfere with our military's freedom of action. Therefore, the committee, at the request of the Japanese side, held a meeting at the American Consulate at 3:00 PM yesterday. All Chinese, Japanese, and relevant foreign members attended, chaired by Committee Chairman Cunningham. After the meeting began, the Japanese representative, Harada, spoke first, stating approximately that the Japanese army was gradually withdrawing back to Japan in accordance with the truce agreement. Unexpectedly, the Chinese side suddenly transferred a thousand military police to Shanghai some days ago. This action not only violated the spirit of the agreement but also risked creating hostile actions. Therefore, he was reporting to the chairman to see if he was aware of this news and how to find a way to stop this action. After Harada finished speaking, the Chinese member, Yu Hongjun, immediately stood up to defend, saying that the Chinese military police's entry into Shanghai did not conflict with Article 2 of the appendix to the principles of the truce agreement. Moreover, the Chinese army's deployment within its own territory should not be interfered with by any third party. Furthermore, the military police's arrival in Shanghai was to maintain local security and had absolutely no intention of hostile action. After Yu finished speaking, the Japanese side expressed dissatisfaction, and the two sides repeatedly argued fiercely. Committee Chairman Cunningham mediated, asking the Chinese member, Yu Hongjun, whether he could notify the Japanese side of future troop movements of the Chinese army. The Chinese member, Yu, firmly refused. As a result, the meeting became deadlocked and lasted for 20 minutes. The Japanese member, Harada, made a concession, asking whether the Chinese army's movements could be notified to the Joint Committee. At that time, Yu still expressed opposition, saying that the Chinese army's troop movements would not be interfered with or questioned by any third party. However, in order to avoid misunderstandings, respect the goodwill of friendly nations, and uphold peace, he agreed to notify the Joint Committee of future troop movements of the Chinese army in an informal manner. Cunningham, upon hearing this, expressed satisfaction. All the members on the floor also agreed with Yu's proposal. The Japanese member, Harada, then stated that he would no longer oppose it. Subsequently, the Chinese member, Yu Hongjun, also questioned the Japanese member, Harada, about the Japanese troops stationed at the Toyoda Spinning Mill and the Tongwen Academy in western Shanghai who had not yet withdrawn. At that time, Harada replied that the Japanese troops would be withdrawn within a few days and would not be stationed there for a long time. The Chinese member then expressed satisfaction. The meeting adjourned at 4:40 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Japanese Army Invading Shanghai Completely Withdraws <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Ueda Kenkichi Leads His Troops Back Home by Ship Yesterday</p>
<p>After the Japanese Ninth Division, which invaded Shanghai, was ordered to withdraw, except for an infantry regiment, an artillery battalion, a machine gun company, and a flight squadron dispatched to the Northeast, the remaining troops were sent to Osaka, Ujina, Moji, and other ports in Japan. Yesterday was the final withdrawal of the remaining troops led by the Ninth Division Commander Ueda. The details of the departure are recorded below:</p>
<p>Commander: Ninth Division Commander Ueda Kenkichi, who was assigned to Shanghai on February 14th, has been here for more than 110 days. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, he led the officers and staff of the Ninth Division to the Huishan Pier by car, and boarded the transport ship Liverpool Maru to return home. At that time, the Volunteer Corps, Marines, and military police were on guard at the pier. Many Japanese residents came to see them off. Japanese military officer Major General Shiozawa, Commander Uematsu, Major General Sakano, Chief of Staff Shimada, Staff Officer Samejima, and officers from the Fifth Fleet Marines also came to see them off. On departure, Ueda shook hands with Murai to say goodbye. He also donated 1,000 Japanese yen to the Japanese Club and the Resident Association, and issued a farewell letter to the Japanese residents, hoping for Sino-Japanese friendship.</p>
<p>Division Headquarters: The battalion base of the Ninth Division Headquarters, along with the officers and staff of the headquarters' management, planning, military law, and other departments, and the guards of Commander Ueda, all gathered at the Huangpu Pier in Yangshupu at 2:00 PM yesterday. The Japanese Army Ministry dispatched the transport ship Liverpool Maru to Shanghai to load them. After the headquarters personnel boarded the ship, the Second Battalion of the Seventh Regiment of Infantry, totaling 600 men, also boarded the ship and left Shanghai at 3:00 PM.</p>
<p>Infantry Unit: In addition, the Third Battalion of the Seventh Regiment of Infantry under the command of the former Hara Brigade, and the headquarters of the Seventh Regiment, and the Ninth Flight Squadron with four aircraft, boarded the transport ship Guang'an Maru at the Zhanghuabang Pier in Wusong at 5:00 PM, totaling 800 to 900 officers and soldiers, and sailed directly to Osaka, Japan.</p>
<p>Mountain Artillery Unit: The entire body of officers and staff belonging to the headquarters of the Japanese Sixth Former Brigade, the First Battalion of the Seventh Regiment of Infantry, and the transportation team, and a mountain artillery battalion, boarded the transport ship New Wave Maru at the Huishan Pier in Yangshupu at noon yesterday, and sailed to Japan, directly to Osaka.</p>
<p>Marines: During the war, the wharves and warehouses of various Japanese shipping companies in Yangshupu, such as the Huangpu, Huishan, and Osaka wharves and warehouses, were all used for military purposes. The Huangpu warehouse stored military food, and the Huishan warehouses stored military ammunition. With the complete departure of the army, some military equipment is still stored in the warehouses. From yesterday, the military ammunition depots at the wharves will be guarded by the Navy Marines.</p>
<p>Transport Ships: After the Japanese army arrived in Shanghai, it leased many transport ships from Nisshin Company and others. With the withdrawal of the entire army, the leased ships have been returned to Nisshin, Osaka, and Japan Mail Steamship Co., and the other three companies. It is reported that the shipping companies plan to resume business operations from June 1st. The White Russians who were previously recruited have now all been transported to the Northeast.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Former Morning Takeover of Wusong Machinery Plant <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>There were many twists and turns beforehand</p>
<p>Japanese troops began withdrawing yesterday morning</p>
<p>Songhu to test the train today</p>
<p>The Wusong Machinery Plant of the two railway bureaus was occupied by the Japanese army, and the internal damage was extensive. The machinery plant had previously sent personnel to inspect the site in order to sort everything out. However, the Japanese troop captain stationed at the plant, Amano Shoichi, sternly refused. On the morning of the 29th, personnel from the takeover committee, along with officials from the two railway bureaus and representatives from the Chinese-British Bank, presented a letter from the Japanese representative of the joint committee, Harada, permitting inspection and proceeded to the site. Unexpectedly, the Japanese troops at the plant refused them again. After repeated negotiations, nothing was achieved. The inspection team had no choice but to return to report to the Takeover Committee of the Retreating Area, which then forwarded the matter to the Joint Committee to negotiate with the Japanese side. Only then was a re-inspection and takeover carried out the day before yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Notification List: When the Takeover Committee took over the plant the day before yesterday, knowing that the Japanese troops stationed there would often make excuses to create difficulties, a list of all the takeover personnel was drawn up and notified by letter. The original letter stated: "This committee hereby appoints Secretary Li Mu, Wu Hong, and Special Commissioner Cha Nanqiang, along with the personnel listed below, to proceed to the Zhanghuabang Railway Factory to handle the takeover matters. This is to certify." The list is as follows: Chief of Mechanical Affairs Wang Shenshan, Deputy Chief Zhong Guidan, Chief Engineer Desifu, Representative of the Chinese-British Bank Davidson, Electrical Factory Director Ge Li, Factory Director Mao Erwei, Chief of Materials Tang Mingfu, Specialist of the Ministry of Railways Sun Mou, Staff Wu Yukun, Xue Zhixian, Lu Cilan, Li Qiaozhi, Meng Sifei, Zhang Xuetao, Xu Yingsheng, Zhuang Qin, Li Bowen. May 30, 21st year of the Republic of China, Chairman Yin Rugeng.</p>
<p>Personnel Departure: All personnel departed successively at 9:30 a.m. and arrived at the Zhanghuabang Wusong Machinery Plant at 10:30 a.m. Special Commissioner Cha Nanqiang and others from the Takeover Committee immediately entrusted the Japanese troops at the factory gate to report their intentions. After a short while, a Japanese adjutant came out. The adjutant was very arrogant, initially claiming that the two railway bureaus were built with loans from the Chinese-British Bank, and that not only had the principal not been repaid to date, but interest was also in arrears. The Chinese-British Bank had previously notified the Japanese side that it was not necessary to return the plant to Chinese control. However, the Japanese side, out of respect for China, was returning it in accordance with the agreement. The tone was severe. At that time, a reporter from the China East News Agency, seeing Mr. Davidson, the representative of the Chinese-British Bank, nearby, asked him about it. According to Davidson, the Chinese-British Bank had never made such a claim. Although the construction of the two railways was financed by loans from the bank, the bank only held the position of creditor. The sovereignty and interests of the railway belonged entirely to the Chinese government, and no one was allowed to interfere. After Mr. Davidson finished speaking, the reporter could not help but laugh.</p>
<p>Calling Names for Entry: The Japanese adjutant immediately went inside to report to Shizawa Naoyoshi, the battalion commander of the 7th Regiment of the 9th Division of the Japanese Army. It was not until 10:45 a.m. that he came out and invited the takeover personnel to enter. However, when entering, names had to be called out one by one, and anyone not listed on the list was rejected. The reporter from the China East News Agency was also rejected at that time. Although negotiations were conducted, nothing was achieved, and he had no choice but to sit idly in the car. According to the takeover personnel,</p>
<p>when they entered, they were first led into a small room. Then, the Japanese adjutant informed the Japanese Army battalion commander Shizawa Naoyoshi and company commander Amano Shoichi. After a long time, the Japanese adjutant invited Secretary Li Mu, Wu Hong, Special Commissioner Cha Nanqiang, Chief of Mechanical Affairs Wang Shenshan, Deputy Chief Zhong Guidan, Chief of Materials Tang Mingfu, Chief Engineer Desifu, Electrical Factory Director Ge Li, and Factory Director Mao Erwei to enter and discuss everything with the Japanese authorities.</p>
<p>Reluctant Inspection: After our personnel entered, they were received by the Japanese battalion commander Shizawa Naoyoshi and company commander Amano Shoichi. Wang Shenshan, the chief of mechanical affairs of the two railway bureaus, then requested the Japanese side to allow Davidson, the representative of the Chinese-British Bank, to enter. The Japanese side initially insisted, but then agreed, only allowing Davidson to participate in the capacity of an observer. After Davidson entered the room, the Japanese side presented a pre-prepared handover document in Japanese, requesting our side to sign it immediately. Our side argued that the interior of the plant had not yet been inspected and that the handover could only be signed after inspection. The Japanese side initially resolutely refused inspection. After repeated requests from our side, they finally agreed and sent personnel to lead the inspection of various parts of the plant. The interior of the plant was severely damaged. All the machines and parts had been dismantled and transported away. Even those that remained were scattered and incomplete and could not be used. During the inspection, Japanese soldiers accompanied and monitored them very strictly. Text Negotiation: The inspection was completed at 12:30 p.m., and negotiations on the handover procedures began immediately. The Japanese side again presented the pre-prepared handover document, requesting our side to sign it. Our side argued that the wording of the handover document was too strict and requested revisions, but the Japanese side resolutely refused. Our takeover personnel then told the Japanese side that what was being taken over today was the plant, and the handover document could simply state the current condition of the plant and return it to our side. They should not be included in a sweeping manner, as this would be completely contrary to the principles of the takeover. However, the Japanese side, upon hearing this, resorted to sophistry, claiming that the Japanese side had occupied the plant without any formal personnel handing it over to them. Now that the two railway authorities were willing to take over, they could do so immediately and should not quibble so much. Their attitude was extremely severe.</p>
<p>Handover Signed: Negotiations between the two sides continued until 1:45 p.m., with no results. The attitude of the Japanese side became even more severe, stating that if the handover was not signed, the Japanese troops would depart on schedule and would no longer be responsible. Our personnel had no choice but to agree to sign, but stated that this handover was a procedure between the two railway bureaus and the Japanese troops stationed at the plant. The right to compensation for damages rested with the national government and would not be affected by this handover. The Japanese side stated that they had no objections. The two sides then signed the handover document and were then treated to lunch by the Japanese side. The process was completed at 2:20 p.m., and our personnel immediately departed.</p>
<p>Takeover of the Plant: The original text of the handover document for the takeover of the Wusong Machinery Plant was not released by the Takeover Committee and the two railway bureaus. However, according to Wang Shenshan, the chief of mechanical affairs of the two railway bureaus, the content of the original text roughly stated that the Japanese regimental commander Shizawa Naoyoshi was now returning the Wusong Machinery Plant to the railway bureau and would no longer be responsible. When the reporter asked if the wording of the handover had been revised, Wang replied that it had not been revised.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Withdraw: The Japanese troops stationed at the Wusong Machinery Plant did not agree to withdraw after the handover was signed. They did not completely withdraw until 5:00 a.m. yesterday. The railway bureau had previously dispatched 20 railway police officers to take over. The railway bureau also believed that since the takeover of the plant was just beginning, it was difficult to start work immediately. Yesterday, Chief of Mechanical Affairs Wang Shenshan, Deputy Chief Zhong Guidan, Chemical Engineer Lu Baogan, Mechanical Engineer Li Bowen, Da Guan, and clerk Xu Yingsheng were specially dispatched, along with Factory Director Mao Erwei, to handle the reorganization work after the takeover.</p>
<p>Plant Losses: According to personnel from the two railway bureaus who had inspected the interior of the plant, the interior of the plant was completely destroyed, and no parts remained. Although the larger machines appeared to be intact, many of the internal parts were also damaged. The telephone and lumber rooms were the most severely damaged. There used to be a large quantity of lumber stored in the lumber room, but it had been almost entirely sold off by the Japanese troops. The two railway lines had 6,000 tons of coal belonging to customers stored there. At 3:30 p.m. on the 29th, a fire suddenly broke out for unknown reasons. It was not until 8:30 p.m. that the fire was extinguished by the ship's fire brigade. The day before yesterday, when the takeover was taking place, a fire broke out again in the coal storage shed. Our takeover personnel hired workers to put it out. The total losses are feared to be very large. In addition, there used to be many Japanese light railways on the tracks inside the plant, but they had already been transported away by the Japanese troops when the takeover took place the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>Test Run Today: The Songhu railway line had not been officially opened to traffic because the Wusong Machinery Plant had not been recovered. Now that the plant was taken over the day before yesterday, a rescue vehicle was specially dispatched yesterday to repair the railway tracks. At 8:00 a.m. this morning, a test run will be officially conducted from the North Station to Zhanghuabang. After the official test run, workers will be loaded and sent to repair the interior of the plant. In addition, the electrical room of the plant has now been completely destroyed. The two railway authorities plan to borrow electricity from the Zhabei Water and Electricity Plant. However, the railway bureau originally used direct current, while the Water and Electricity Plant uses alternating current. Whether it is suitable will be decided after testing today.</p>

<h3 id="e142">All Industries Carried Out the Annual Year 20 Closing Yesterday <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce and the Money Industry Rest Today</p>
<p>Whether to Extend or Not Depends on Credit</p>
<p>Yesterday was the day for the general closing of the year 20. Today, the City Chamber of Commerce and the money industry are taking a day off to reorganize. Various groups such as the Citizens' United Association, due to the impact of the war on various industries, resolved through the Business Resumption Committee to continue extending the deadline for mortgage loans and long-term loans. All borrowers are required to settle accounts at the end of the year, and representatives have been sent to Beijing and to the municipal government to petition. The details of each item are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Attitude of the Money Industry: Yesterday, all the firms in the money industry carried out the general closing of the year 20, and all the staff were very busy. Demand promissory notes, such as those collected by banks, were collected and settled on the same day. Foreign currency and silver dismantling were opened as usual. The Ningbo Road money market is also closed today. Regarding the issue of extending the deadline for mortgages and current overdrafts, the Trade Association specially replied to the Citizens' United Association yesterday, stating: "Regarding the letter received yesterday, the letter from your association's fifth Business Resumption Committee meeting resolved the issue of closing accounts at the end of May and made two requests to our association, urging us to accommodate them. After investigation, our colleagues in the industry have considerable friendship with various industries in terms of mortgages and current overdrafts, and customers' credit is also different, so it seems that a general discussion cannot be held. As for the general closing at the end of this month, our association's colleagues are absolutely free to operate, and the accounts are handled separately. Our association has no right to interfere. This is in response and respectfully requests your attention."</p>
<p>Attitude of Banks: The general closing of the banking industry has traditionally been at the end of June and the end of December. Yesterday, because it was the day for the general closing of the year 20, a meeting was held and it was resolved that business would continue as usual today and there would be no rest. However, regarding post-war industrial mortgages and long-term current overdrafts, because various industries have considerable friendship and credit with various banks, and the banks only earn some interest, it was decided that each bank would freely decide how to handle it, and the Trade Association had no right to interfere.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Closed: Various industries were particularly busy yesterday, carrying out the general closing. According to the resolutions of various trade associations, they rushed to collect debts from other places. The City Chamber of Commerce, as usual, took a day off after the general closing. Yesterday, it specially notified all sectors that it would stop working today to reorganize.</p>

<h3 id="e144">Real Estate Association Sends Letter to Water Company Striving to Amend the New Regulations <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Monopoly Businesses Should Take Care of Public Interests</p>
<p>Cannot Erase Everything by Having the Right to Cut Off Water</p>
<p>The Shanghai Real Estate Association sent a letter to the British-owned Shanghai Water Company yesterday, stating: "Regarding the reply on May 6 and the letter to your president, both have been read and understood, and the responses and statements of your company to the parties concerned have also been collected and carefully studied. Although it is still possible to conduct detailed discussions from a factual point of view, between the lines, not only is the protection of one-sided interests revealed, but also the word 'right' is used as a talisman to protect one-sided interests, which is extremely regrettable. However, although our association is a representative organization of real estate, its words and deeds are nothing more than for the benefit of the entire public. Otherwise, the burden imposed on the real estate industry by your company relying on the so-called power can be passed on. However, fairness and reason are unique to mankind. In order to maintain this fairness and reason and seek justice not to be buried by selfishness, we are willing to discuss with your company again. (1) Your company tells people that the average daily water consumption per person was 10 gallons in 1905, 15 gallons in 1915, and 33 gallons in 1930, in order to show that the increase in daily water consumption per person is very large. However, the water price is calculated based on rent. May I ask whether the rent in 1905 and 1930 is the same? In fact, today's rent has increased 20 times compared to 1905, and the water price has also increased from 5% to 7.5%. The rate of increase in income is much higher than the rate of increase in daily water consumption per person. (2) Your company tells people that the actual water fee collected now is only 35 cents per thousand gallons. When the water was supplied on a fixed-rate basis, this price could maintain business operations. Then, when the water is metered, this price should also be able to maintain business operations. After all, after metering, the wasted water is reduced, and it seems that income decreases. However, the wasted water also requires costs. Now that it has been reduced, these costs are also reduced. Why does the water price calculated by the meter have to be almost doubled to 62.5 cents compared to the fixed-rate price of 35 cents? Is the wasted water reduced by metering more than half of the fixed-rate amount? Or is there no calculation guarantee at present, so it is okay to collect it all, and the balance will be returned to users after all water meters are installed in the future? (3) Your company tells people that the water price in Zhabei and the French Concession cannot be compared with the Public Concession because the former has a unified water meter system, while the latter is mostly a fixed-rate system. However, they are both in the same area of Shanghai and cannot be compared. Instead, they compare British and American cities with the Public Concession and claim that it is appropriate. Comparing the payment methods of the French Concession and Zhabei with themselves is acceptable? Can it not be suspected that what is beneficial to oneself should be compared, and what is beneficial to others can be compared without relying on the words 'having the right'? (4) Your company tells people that the owner's collection of water fees is a practice that has been followed, is common in the French Concession and Zhabei, and is similar to various British and American cities, and that it cannot be the same as electricity and gas because the use of electricity and gas is not universal, while tap water is universal. Fourth, if there are cases of water fee arrears, the law has a prior lien on the property. In addition to the second item that has been stated in the above article, let's first talk about the habit. Before there was tap water, residents used river water. This is the habit. Then, setting up a water company is actually an act of destroying the habit. From this point of view, the rivers that have been filled in should be restored, and the water company should immediately take out the water pipes, dismantle the water towers, and fill in the water pools. In short, stopping business can be called maintaining the habit. Even if not, restoring the water rate calculated at 5% of the rent can be called maintaining the habit. Why does one abolish habits as much as possible for one's own benefit and force owners to perform non-obligatory things, such as the habit of collecting, paying, and compensating for water fees, and insist on maintaining it without failure with the means of cutting off water as a backing? It is really puzzling. Regarding the third item, what was the situation when tap water was first introduced? The water company was not initially set up because all residents wanted to use tap water. It was first set up to persuade residents to gradually use it. What was the situation at this time, and how did the scope of use of electricity and gas today compare? The records are complete and can be easily reviewed. The fourth point originally used the owner's real estate as collateral for the user's water fees. I don't know what kind of legal theory this law is based on. Even if the United Kingdom and the United States have this law, China does not have this law. However, do taxpayers' unpaid taxes to the Engineering Bureau and users' unpaid electricity bills to the power company also have a prior lien on the owner's property? Why don't taxes and electricity fear not being compensated and force the owner to be a non-obligatory person who collects, pays, and compensates? However, if the word 'having the right' is used as an excuse and cutting off water is used as a shield, then even if there is a reason, there is no room for explanation. (5) The resolutions of our association are copied below. (1) Notify all landlords to immediately open artesian wells for application, so as to avoid being arbitrarily taken by monopoly operators. (2) Notify all landlords to refuse to sign the new contract for tap water with one-sided requirements and one-sided interests, so as to avoid future troubles. Even if the water is cut off, the water cutter will be legally responsible for obstructing people's livelihood and security. (3) Still send a letter to the British-owned Shanghai Water Company to maintain the original proposal of the association. (A) Water fees are not collected on behalf to avoid the loss of paying and compensating for water fees. (B) One water meter per house is used to show fairness and avoid the fact that those who use less pay more water fees and those who use more pay less water fees, and the water fees must be actually used and actually collected. (C) The installation and deposit of water meters are not the responsibility of the user. (D) The water price is too high, which is not in line with the economic ability of Shanghai users and the good rules of the monopoly industry. (Such as the water price in Zhabei, which still allows the company to earn profits no less than the interest of the British-owned Shanghai Water Company.) Also, supplement the above original proposal, that is, 'Before all water meters are installed in the entire supply area, the fixed-rate system may be temporarily tolerated, but when the water company voluntarily collects water fees directly from users, all fixed-rate rent water fees should be verified and deducted, and the users should pay the water company themselves.' (6) If your company wants to work with our association to jointly seek to relieve the difficulties of the three parties, namely the company, the owner, and the user, on the basis of fairness and reason and public interest, our association is very welcome and very willing to cooperate. In short, truth will definitely overcome power, and power that conforms to truth is true power. Otherwise, the powerless will be slaughtered by the powerful and there will be no survivors. What is the purpose of holding the International Disarmament Conference? A corresponding letter is sent in the hope that you will check and consider it in detail for the convenience of both public and private interests."</p>
<h3 id="e145">Gu Zhutong Receives Newspaper Reporters <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Delivers Important Speech</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, Gu Zhutong, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, received members of the local press at the China Press Club on Weihaiwei Road. Over a dozen reporters from various newspapers and news agencies were present. During the meeting, Mr. Gu delivered the following important speech:</p>
<p>Newspapers Are the Teachers of the People: Gentlemen, I am very pleased to have this opportunity to meet with you all here. I came to Shanghai to inspect the current state of the war zone and to discuss relief and reconstruction efforts with senior figures in Shanghai. Shanghai's newspaper industry has been at the forefront of the nation's trends for a long time, naturally forming the center of Chinese public opinion. It is often said that newspapers are the voice of the people, representing their opinions. However, I believe it is more accurate to say that they are the teachers of the people. Their function lies in shaping public thought and stimulating general public research on political and social issues. Their effect is much greater than that of textbooks. The level of civilization in various countries around the world can almost be directly proportional to the circulation of their newspapers. Major newspapers in Europe and America often have daily circulations of over a million copies, or even several million copies. Naturally, we are not yet at that number. This is not necessarily a matter of the quality of the newspapers, but rather a matter of the general public's knowledge. Statistics show that over 80% of the Chinese population is illiterate, which is the opposite of countries where over 80% of the population is literate. How can the circulation of our newspapers catch up with theirs? Therefore, I hope that newspapers will first act as teachers of the people, assisting school education and social education, and raising the general public's knowledge as a whole. Only then can they take the second step of speaking what the people want to say and representing their opinions.</p>
<p>Newspapers Are the Guide for the Government: Another responsibility of newspapers is to faithfully record the state of domestic and international politics and the people's livelihoods and to provide fair and appropriate criticism of government policies, like a compass indicating the direction of politics to the government. This is naturally what the government urgently needs. Especially in Jiangsu, which recently suffered a major flood and bore the brunt of the national crisis, enduring tremendous sacrifices, the suffering of the people and the difficulties of governance have reached an extreme point. I and my colleagues in the provincial government sincerely hope that the press will guide and help us as much as possible, constantly informing us of the actual suffering of the people in various places to supplement the areas that administrative investigation cannot reach. On the other hand, we hope you will offer unreserved advice on the things we do, so that we can refer to it and seek improvement. This is what we most hope for.</p>
<p>The Actual Conditions of the People's Suffering: Speaking of this, I should briefly report on the recent suffering of the people in Jiangsu, as far as we already know, and the recent governance situation in Jiangsu Province, for your reference. Regarding the first point, the suffering of the people, we can further divide it into several levels. First, financial poverty. Jiangsu is indeed a province with strong people and wealth, but in recent decades, production has gradually declined, and living has become increasingly luxurious. On the one hand, income has decreased, and on the other hand, expenditures have increased sharply, which has long become a superficial strength with internal weakness. Coupled with floods, droughts, and frequent banditry, overseas businesses have suffered a devastating blow due to the failure of international competition. Agriculture, industry, and commerce have all suffered tremendous blows. In addition, the losses suffered in the Shanghai war resulted in an estimated unemployment of over one million people. We are currently investigating and compiling statistics on property and business losses, etc., but their scale must be enormous.</p>
<p>Now, we also have to deal with the aftermath of the war. The financial distress of the people has truly reached a point beyond repair. Second, the scourge of banditry makes it difficult for good people to live and work in peace. The rural economy and commercial markets have been greatly affected. The poor have become even poorer, and the scourge of banditry has become even more severe, almost mutually causing and mutually resulting, and the people's livelihood has become even more unimaginable. Third, education has declined. The current state of education in Jiangsu, on the surface, still seems to have middle schools, primary schools, and social education institutions in place. But looking at its content, who would not say that it is secretly regressing? What is the reason? The academic atmosphere is not disciplined, and students often strike and abandon their studies. Those in charge of schools only seek to avoid trouble and do not strictly examine students' homework. Students' parents use their hard-earned money to send their children to school. The current situation is so painful, and the decline of culture is self-evident. Moreover, the original teaching methods are not entirely suitable for social needs. After graduation, students cannot find jobs in society, and the effectiveness of education cannot be considered satisfactory. Fourth, industry is not thriving. China is a country founded on agriculture, and Jiangsu is a region rich in natural resources. But not to mention anything else, just taking the most important agricultural product, "rice," the rice produced in Jiangsu Province is not enough to meet the needs of the province. Other products, such as silk, have also suffered very heavy losses. As for the province's original small industries, that is, handicraft industries, such as native cloth, etc., they are gradually declining, even to the point of extinction, not to mention anything else. To summarize the above-mentioned current state of the people's suffering, it can be reduced to two sentences: 1. People cannot live and work in peace. 2. People cannot enjoy education. Therefore, my colleagues and I believe that the policy of governance should take these two sentences as the target and plan fundamental solutions.</p>
<p>Recent Policy Direction of Colleagues: Now, let me report on the recent policies of my colleagues. To address financial poverty, the fundamental solution is to develop production. To develop production, we must improve agricultural seeds, build water conservancy, and facilitate transportation. These are mostly under the charge of the Industrial Development Bureau. We have already organized the improvement of silkworm seeds, established the Silk Industry Supervision Office, designated Jintan as a silkworm experimental zone, and promoted improvements, which have been quite effective. However, this year, the timing is not right, and the silk industry has been severely damaged. Experimental fields have also been established for rice and wheat to study improvements. In terms of water conservancy, the urgent need in northern Jiangsu is to repair the Grand Canal embankment project, which is now almost completed. Fundamentally, we must focus on guiding the Huai River. In southern Jiangsu, the sea dike project is extremely important. We have jointly established a Southern Jiangsu Dike Engineering Committee with the Shanghai Municipal Government to actively carry out the sea dike project. In terms of transportation, the most important thing is provincial and county roads, which are currently being carried out in earnest. The temporary solution is to seek relief for the war zone. The Central Government has now established the Songhu War Zone Reconstruction Committee, and Jiangsu has also established the War Zone Relief Committee. The Central Government will allocate a large amount of funds to implement comprehensive relief, while the provincial government will find ways to provide temporary emergency relief. The remedy for the scourge of banditry is also divided into fundamental and temporary measures. Fundamentally, we must seek to protect the people themselves to supplement the government's insufficient strength. In order to coordinate self-defense measures, the Provincial Security Committee has been established in the province, and security committees have been established in each county, responsible for handling security matters in each county. The province is responsible for designing and training, and each county must strictly comply. Temporarily, the Su-Song Water Bandit Suppression Temporary Headquarters has been established to eliminate the banditry in southern Jiangsu. To remedy the decline of education, on the one hand, we strictly rectify the academic atmosphere. If any incidents of disrupting school discipline occur, we will not hesitate to take severe measures, as seen in the handling of the Xu Middle School disturbance. The Education Bureau is still issuing circulars to schools throughout the province, earnestly warning students to abide by the rules. On the other hand, we are studying education that meets the needs of society, especially in social education, focusing on literacy education and livelihood education, so that education can be popularized and can increase production, becoming beneficial education. To remedy the sluggishness of industry, the general situation has been seen in the above-mentioned fundamental solutions to financial poverty. Last month, the provincial government issued a circular to all counties in the province, the main idea of which was to see the situation of local production failure and to ask them to propose relief measures. Special attention should be paid to the local promotion of original small industries to maintain the livelihood of the common people. This is something that was not mentioned above. In short, society is a whole, and various pathological conditions are interrelated. Therefore, politics is also a whole. Only doing one aspect will not achieve results. For example, if banditry is eliminated, the people can naturally live and work in peace. If production is increased, and the people have their own occupations, banditry can be fundamentally eliminated. If education is suitable for the needs of the occupation, there will be more talents, and industry can naturally be revitalized. But industry must also be revitalized, so that talents have a place to use their skills, and education can achieve real results. Therefore, facilities cannot focus on one aspect. We must use all our strength to revitalize the entire political system in order to save the entire sickness of society. My colleagues and I are ashamed of our lack of talent and strength. We now have the organization of the Provincial Political Discussion Conference to gather opinions and plan everything. However, bearing such a heavy responsibility, it is inevitable that there will be many areas where the investigation cannot be thorough and the design cannot be detailed. I hope that the Shanghai press, which occupies a leading position in the country, will provide more guidance and more help. There are many other things in the provincial administration that have already been announced at the reception of the National Disaster Relief Association, etc., yesterday. You all already know, so I will not repeat them, etc. After Mr. Gu finished his speech, Director of Education Zhou Fohai and Director of Civil Affairs Zhao Qilu successively elaborated on the adverse phenomena of education and civil affairs and the direction in which we should strive to remedy and improve them, in great detail. Finally, they hoped that the press would provide strong assistance.</p>
<p>Welcome From Various Groups the Day Before Yesterday: The local War Zone Relief Association, the National Disaster Relief Association, and three other vocational education groups held a meeting at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday on the third floor of the China Vocational Guidance Center to welcome Jiangsu Provincial Chairman Gu Zhutong, Director of Finance Shu Shiwen, Director of Civil Affairs Zhao Qihua, Director of Education Zhou Fohai, and Director of Construction Dong Xiujia. Mr. Gu gave an important speech on issues such as finance, civil affairs, education, and construction in Jiangsu Province, the content of which was roughly the same as that delivered to reporters yesterday. Therefore, we omit it here.</p>
<p>Gu and Others Inspect the War Zone This Morning: Mr. Gu and the directors of various departments are scheduled to go to the war zones of Kunshan, Anting, Huangdu, and Nanxiang by car at 7:00 AM this morning for inspection. They are also scheduled to inspect Liuhua and other places tomorrow. As for the date of Mr. Gu and others' return to Zhenjiang, it has been set for June 3, it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e147">Further Extension of the Winter Grain Tax Deadline in County <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Until June 15</p>
<p>The 20th annual winter grain tax of Shanghai County was previously affected by the war, and the deadline was extended for one month from April 16 to May 15. Collection points were set up. Now that the deadline has expired, the amount collected is small. The County Local Funds Management Office and the District Office have submitted letters to the Finance Bureau, stating that the extension period coincides with the time when the old and new crops are not yet available, and the people are mostly unable to complete the payment. Once the spring crops are harvested, the amount collected can be more prosperous, and they have requested to further extend the deadline for one month to alleviate the people's difficulties. The Bureau then submitted it to the Finance Department for review and instructions. Now, we have received a telegram that reads: "Now that the deadline has expired, it is impossible to extend it again. Considering the special circumstances of the county, we will allow a further extension of one month to show our sympathy. No further requests will be allowed thereafter." After receiving the order, Director Wang has already announced to the grain households in the county that they must complete the payment of the 20th year's grain tax as soon as possible from now until June 15, and a fine will be charged after the deadline.</p>

<p>Seems Better Than in Previous Years</p>
<p>Recently, some people have claimed that the Huangpu River water is particularly turbid, which may be harmful to the health of residents. The chemical testing technicians of the Shanghai Waterworks Company have specially tested the river water in detail. According to the test results, the amount of microorganisms in the water is still normal, and the condition of the river water seems to be better than in previous years. There was very little rain at the beginning of this year, but recently there have been frequent heavy rains, so although the water quality seems more turbid, it is not really so.</p>

<p>The China Motor Bus Company, with the Japanese soldiers withdrawing as scheduled, and security being taken over by our police, is actively maintaining traffic on the one hand, and engaged in internal rectification on the other. Its third route (i.e., Zhenru) has had its route temporarily changed due to traffic road obstructions, specifically approved by the authorities. That is, starting from the North-South Railway Station Boundary Road, along Xinmin Road, Datong Road, connected to Jiaotong Road, directly to Zhenru.

As for the first route (i.e., Jiangwan), because the entire road surface and Yokohama Bridge have not been repaired, the recovery period is only a matter of time. The board of directors decided yesterday that the free ride tickets previously given to social service personnel, recently due to the disaster, everything is desolate, and there are few pedestrians. The operation of vehicles has been specifically reduced. All those holding free passes will have their validity terminated from the date of resumption. In addition, the regulations for military and police groups to pay half-price fares, political workers must be considerate of commercial difficulties and fully comply with the regulations in order to maintain capital.</p>

<p>Registration Extended by Two Weeks</p>
<p>The War Loss Registration Office, jointly organized by the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Accountants Association, convened a joint meeting yesterday, and the minutes of the resolutions are as follows: (1) The registration originally scheduled to end at the end of this month, but recently, there has been a very enthusiastic response to registration. Should the deadline be extended? It was decided to extend the deadline by two weeks and publish an announcement in the newspaper. (2) Schedule to send representatives to the disaster areas to inspect and estimate the extent of the disaster on each road. It was decided that representatives from the three agencies would be sent out in groups to inspect. Mo Ruoqiang, Liu Baoheng, Zhu Wenqi, Wang Haifan, Sun Zhongyao, Jiang Wanping, Bei Zuyi, and other seven people were appointed. It was decided that they would depart on June 3 and 4. The route list and forms would be drafted by the Bureau of Social Affairs. (3) The Accountants Association proposed that it has been recently seen in newspapers that the Songhu War Zone Rehabilitation Committee is still ordered to deal with the investigation of losses in this war. Should the war damage registration handled by the office be negotiated with the association? It was requested for deliberation. It was decided to assign Liu Baoheng to investigate the organizational content of the association before discussing the matter again. (4) According to a letter from Jiang, he was elected as a representative by 24 victims of the war zone, including Liu. The victims contributed a total of three yuan for transportation expenses, which was received by Jiang. Now, someone is impersonating Jiang's name to collect additional fees from the victims. Jiang believes that this has damaged his personal reputation and has requested the office to investigate. The office has announced in the newspaper that the war loss registration is free of charge. The letter does not state what the task of the representative appointed by Jiang is, and the use of the fees is even more unclear. Since Jiang has requested the office to investigate, it seems to be related to the registration matters. Then, the fees received by Jiang are already inappropriate, and now there is someone impersonating to solicit fraud. How should this be corrected? It was decided to announce again that the victims should register directly with the office free of charge. If there are any extortion and fraud from the outside world, it should be reported to the office for investigation and prohibition.</p>

Our committee believes that charitable work is the highest expression of human emotion and should grant their request to encourage them.

<p>The Poor Education Fund has continued to operate as usual this year, despite the extremely unstable situation and social economic panic. The deadline for applying for subsidies for this year's enrollment was originally set for the end of May, but due to the later start of the new semester at various universities and the postal strike, the deadline has been extended to the end of June to increase coverage. The examination period is expected to be in early August.

<p>Qu Baichun Bravely Wounded</p>
<p>Police Will Conduct Strict Inspections</p>
<p>On the evening of the 29th of last month, at about 7 PM, bandits suddenly arrived in batches in Zhangjialou Town, Pudong. Qu Baichun, the head of the Yangjing District Security Corps, followed the bandits with a gun to investigate. He was suddenly shot in a vital area by the bandits. He was sent to the hospital for treatment afterward. The findings of the investigation are recorded below:</p>
<p>Chasing Bandits and Being Shot On the evening of the 29th, at about 7 PM, many bandits suddenly came to the town, in twos and threes, forming teams from the west, looking around, and then returning east to west. There were about twenty of them. Qu Baichun, the owner of the Yongsheng Rice Shop in the town (who is also the head of the 22nd Ward and the head of the Security Corps), was keeping accounts when he saw this situation and became suspicious. He immediately secretly instructed all members of the town's Security Corps to be on high alert. Qu then carried a Mauser rifle and secretly investigated behind the bandit party. When he reached the center of the town, Qu questioned the bandits about where they were going. Unexpectedly, the bandits had already noticed. One of the bandits preemptively retreated two steps, took out a pistol from his sleeve, and fired four shots backwards. One shot hit Qu's chest. Mr. Qu remained extremely calm, lay on the ground, and fired seven or eight shots, hitting a bandit in a vital area, but he still escaped. Therefore, the bandit party's attempt to rob was unsuccessful. At that time, all members of the town's Security Corps fired their guns and searched in various directions. In the fields on the west side, they found a blood-stained twill white short shirt discarded by the wounded bandit, with two bullet holes in the back, one clean and one with hair, as if the bullet had entered from the left side and exited from the right side. There were also two felt hats, one gray and one dark red velvet, as well as a blue plaid wool long gown and a navy blue serge long gown.</p>
<p>Qu's Injuries After Qu was shot and injured, the Security Corps members were unaware of it until they heard his cries for help. When they went to investigate, they helped him up, but he was bleeding all over the ground. They managed to send him to the Sacred Heart Hospital on Ningguo Road in Yangshupu that night for treatment. Because the bullet was deeply embedded under his right rib, they obtained the consent of his family and Dr. Zhang Youmei and Dr. Ma Shijiong performed surgery to open his abdomen. They found that the bullet was deeply embedded inside the liver and difficult to remove. They temporarily sutured the wound in the liver, and if his condition worsened, they would perform a final operation to remove the bullet. According to the hospital's announcement, Mr. Qu's condition was as follows: At 8 AM on the 30th, his temperature was 38 degrees and his pulse was 96. He urinated once at 7 AM, 500 CC. At 4 PM on the 30th, his temperature was 39.3 degrees and his pulse was 112. At 8 AM on the 31st, his temperature was 37.8 degrees and his pulse was 96. He urinated twice and had no bowel movements. It is heard that his injuries are very critical. Yesterday, Xu Baoming, the head of the Yangjing District Security Corps, reported to his superiors for verification.</p>
<p>Who Is He? After the incident, the Security Corps members were on high alert all night. At dawn, they suddenly encountered a man in the east of the town who was lingering and unwilling to leave. When he saw people, he looked flustered and extremely suspicious. He was arrested and sent to the Second Branch of the Third District. According to his confession, his name is Bao Jinxian, he is from Shandong, and he lives in the eighteenth room on the east side of Qichang Inn. He is currently working in a yarn factory. Since there is no yarn factory in Zhangjialou, his confession was very contradictory. Yesterday, the director ordered him to be sent to the General Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<p>Unity and Security Zhangjialou is located southwest of Yangjing Town in Pudong, about six miles away from the Huangpu River, and is under the jurisdiction of the Second Branch of the Third District. There are dozens of shops open in the town. Most of the residents in the town are Catholics. Over time, the town has become an area for Catholic believers. These people are wealthy and have an unusually strong sense of unity. In the first year of the Republic, Qu Baichun (the head of the 26th Ward), the owner of the Yongsheng Rice Shop in the town, organized a commercial corps, raised funds to purchase firearms, and achieved excellent results. In the second year of the Republic, when Mr. Chen Ying'shi failed in the battle in Shanghai, a small number of soldiers fled to the town. Mr. Qu immediately set up machine guns at the main roads at the entrance of the town, sent personnel to guard them, and summoned the corps members to fire their guns to repel the soldiers. The soldiers were scattered, and the town was able to escape the danger. Later, the commercial corps was ordered to be reorganized into a Security Corps, and Mr. Qu was appointed as the head of the corps. Qu firmly declined, so the General Headquarters hired him as the head of the corps and divided the corps members into the First Team of the Yangjing District. The reason why the town has been peaceful to this day and the thieves have not dared to move is due to the strong unity of the residents.</p>
<p>Inspection and Prevention of Bandits Local merchants and residents believe that after the end of the Shanghai War, Zhabei, Jiangwan, Wusong, and Zhenru were taken over by our police. Most of the ruffians and traitors, knowing that they had nowhere to go, crossed the river to the east. Therefore, robbery cases have occurred frequently in Pudong recently. After the bandit shooting of the head of the Security Corps in Zhangjialou, they were very frightened and specially requested the police authorities to strictly inspect those with suspicious traces in the area near the Huangpu River to prevent the bandits from mixing in and to ensure safety. It is heard that the police authorities immediately ordered their subordinates to pay attention to prevention and strictly inspect.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Large Gambling Den Under Japanese Protection Raided <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Qingshui Wensheng Sets Up a Scam</p>
<p>Ignorant Chinese Fall for the Trap</p>
<p>Police Arrest More Than Ten People</p>
<p>Negotiations Demanding Compensation</p>
<p>Since the Japanese forcibly occupied Zhabei, several months have passed. The Japanese have seen this as a rare opportunity to make money. Among them, there are various illegal matters such as promoting prostitution, sheltering opium, and openly gambling, all kinds of things. Moreover, many Japanese rogues have taken the opportunity to set up scams, fooling the Chinese into opening gambling venues, while they take advantage of them. The number of Chinese who have been harmed by them is countless. Yesterday, the Public Concession Police raided a gambling venue at the bottom of Wusong Road, Shenjiawan, which was a scene of Japanese rogues setting up a scam. It also involved a certain major general of the Japanese army. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>The Dasheng Club Since the Japanese army occupied Zhabei on March 2nd, it was widely rumored that the Japanese would openly set up gambling venues in the forcibly occupied areas. At that time, the general public did not dare to believe it. Unexpectedly, within ten days, the rumor became a reality. More than ten gambling venues, large and small, were established at the same time. Later, after the agreement was reached, the Japanese army gradually withdrew, and unfortunately, the puppet traitors had internal strife. Therefore, in the most recent week, all the gambling venues closed down. The only one that survived was the Dasheng Club at No. 16 Shoudeli, Shenjiawan, at the bottom of Wusong Road. The reason why it stood alone was said to be backed by the Japanese rogue Qingshui Wensheng.</p>
<p>The Japanese Rogue Sets Up a Scam The Japanese rogue Qingshui Wensheng claimed to be one of Japan's writers. Who this person is, the Chinese are not clear about. Two weeks ago, Qingshui vigorously persuaded a certain Cantonese, saying that he and a certain major general currently stationed at the Zhabei Japanese Army Headquarters were classmates. Anything that anyone cannot do, he can handle it single-handedly. The Cantonese was moved by this and joined friends to raise funds to open the Dasheng Club at No. 16 Shoudeli, Shenjiawan, at the bottom of Wusong Road.</p>
<p>Detective's Raid When the Cantonese was negotiating with Qingshui, it was agreed that the Japanese Army Headquarters would issue a permit, and a fee of 250 yuan in Qing Dynasty currency would be paid every day, paid on a daily basis and not overdue or short. In addition, Qingshui would be given a reward of 3,000 yuan. After the negotiation was completed, the money was exchanged, and the so-called Headquarters permit was issued on the same day. A week ago, it began to operate. Unexpectedly, at about 5 PM yesterday, Liu Shaokui, a Chinese detective chief of the Public Concession Police, suddenly led Chinese and Western detectives to No. 16 Shoudeli. They arrested more than ten staff members and gamblers on the spot, and took all the gambling equipment and exhibits to the police station, waiting to be sent to court for investigation.</p>
<p>Demanding Compensation It is heard that among the more than ten people arrested, there were two Japanese. These two Japanese were said to have been recommended by Qingshui. Since the case occurred, the Cantonese was very angry, thinking that the Japanese Qingshui should not have set up a scam, causing such a major loss. The Cantonese intends to first seriously negotiate with Qingshui, demanding compensation. If there is no satisfactory reply, he will take photos of the issued permit and publish them in Chinese and Western newspapers to expose the conspiracy of the Japanese.</p>

<p>Many Wooden Boxes and Parts</p>
<p>Police Take Photos for Detailed Study</p>
<p>Wang Changgen and Cao Bingkun, the Chinese detective chiefs of the Public Concession Police Headquarters, previously joined forces with Pan Gensi, the Western detective chief of the Narcotics Division, and Song Bingzheng, the Chinese detective, to raid a morphine manufacturing facility at No. 18 West Jiaxing Road. They arrested ten people, including the Japanese Nakamura and the Chinese Fang Yinbao, Lin Huiqing, and Zhou Yongyuan. They seized a large number of morphine drugs and machinery worth more than 35,000 yuan. The Japanese Nakamura was sent to the Japanese Consulate for interrogation, and Fang Yinbao and the other nine people were sent to the First Special Court for interrogation. These details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Qiao Wanxuan presided over a further hearing at the High Court. Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, stated that during the adjournment, the Chinese and Western detectives who handled the case went to the site for further investigation. They searched and found four bottles of medicine, two yellow and two black. The yellow ones were opium dross, and the bottles were labeled in Japanese. The black ones were also opium materials. They also seized two account books, which stated that they were all for selling morphine for export. In addition, they found many wooden boxes in the house next door to No. 16. The format of the wooden boxes was the same as the wooden boxes seized at the original site. The house was also rented by a Japanese. These wooden boxes were prepared to pack and export the morphine after it was manufactured. The nine and a half pounds of white powder seized last time were chemically tested and found to be heroin, which is even more potent than morphine. Because there were so many various parts, the police took photos to keep them as evidence. Who rented the house has not yet been found out. The various drugs seized last time were initially chemically tested and found to be materials for manufacturing morphine. There is a report form. The case is adjourned again so that various drugs can be studied in detail. The photos of various parts and the two bottles of yellow and black drugs were presented for inspection. After inspecting the various pieces of evidence, the judge ordered a change of date for the trial, and the defendants were still sent back to the police station.</p>

<p>The Four Banks' Clearing House is jointly formed by the Yanye, Jincheng, Zhongnan, and Dalu Banks. It has a solid foundation and a grand scale. Recently, in view of the increasing prosperity of Chinese and foreign trade in Shanghai, the procedures for adjusting financial matters have gradually increased. However, due to the inconvenience of the divisions between Chinese and foreign banks in terms of receiving and paying funds, it was agreed with the permission of the Foreign Merchants' Association on the Bund to join the association as a member. From then on, it can receive and pay freely and handle matters uniformly with the banks on the Bund. It has been decided to communicate clearing accounts from June 1st and join the Foreign Merchants' Association. It has been notified to the financial industry and related merchants yesterday (To whom it may concern, from June 1st, our bank will receive and pay cash for all incoming and outgoing funds, whether silver or foreign currency. At the same time, we will join the Foreign Merchants' Banking Association and circulate clearing accounts. We hereby inform you of this and hope that you will check it.

<h3 id="e173">Chrysler Motors President Moss Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Moss, Export President of Chrysler Motors Company of the United States, recently came to the Far East to inspect the automobile business. He arrived in Shanghai yesterday aboard the Dollar Company's President Cleveland. Mr. Flemen, Manager of China Motors Company, and Mr. Madi, Manager of Madi Motors Company, Chrysler's Shanghai agent, hosted a reception for Mr. Moss last night at the Astor House Hotel, inviting members of the Shanghai press and automobile dealers as guests. Eighteen people attended. Chairman Flemen introduced Mr. Moss, who said in his address that he was very pleased to meet everyone. Chrysler is one of the most famous automobile manufacturers in the United States. Its magnificent buildings, with millions of dollars used to build a huge building, are well known to everyone present. Its products, such as Plymouth (Shunfeng brand), Chrysler, etc., are famous all over the world. Recently, the adoption of "floating power" construction has made it even more advanced. This is also a kind of innovation in the automobile industry. Automobiles are very important to human life. In the United States, there are currently no less than 30,000,000 cars. This is true all over the world. Human life can hardly be without this item. My impression of this trip is very deep, and I feel that the beginning of progress has already begun. However, to make it bigger and better, it depends on everyone present. I believe that the most important things in China right now are three things: education, publishing, and transportation. Why? Education enlightens the people, publishing promotes culture, and transportation develops industry. Now those present are newspaper reporters and automobile merchants. This is just my humble opinion, which can be corrected by those with greater knowledge. Mr. Moss finally said that all undertakings based on honesty can succeed. The audience was moved. The reception was accompanied by music and dance, and the guests and hosts parted happily. The humorous remarks of the host, Mr. Flemen, also made those present laugh endlessly.</p>

<h3 id="e181">Declaration of the Rent Reduction Committee of Chengde Lane, Guoging Road <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>The declaration of the Rent Reduction Committee of Chengde Lane, Guoging Road states: It is known that during the recent Shanghai Incident, our Guoging Road was also within the fire zone. Although the houses in Chengde Lane were not turned into scorched earth, the residents had all fled. The direct and indirect losses are beyond description. Moreover, the incident happened suddenly, and it was lucky to escape alone. Clothing and goods must not have been moved. Because the junction of the Chinese and French concessions was closed, and traffic was blocked, it was like a prison. Airplanes dropped bombs and set fires, turning the area into rubble. The residents of Guoging Road and its vicinity, supporting the old and carrying the young, rushed to cross the river. Some fell into the river, and some were scattered, causing cries to shake the sky. Any property was abandoned at home, and later suffered from theft by traitors, leaving most families empty. The chaos was such that the vitality was exhausted and there were no tears to cry. It was a catastrophe unprecedented in history. Now that the peace conference has been concluded and the situation is gradually stable, the tenants are gradually moving back. The houses in Chengde Lane on Guoging Road are adjacent to the concessions, so the rents are extraordinarily high. The tenants are mostly poor people. Before the war, it was already difficult to pay the rent. Now, after the war, how can they afford the high rent? Therefore, we have gathered all the tenants in the lane to form a rent reduction committee, with the aim of regulating finance and reducing the burden. We cite the precedents of the capital Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Hangzhou, and the concessions, and make legitimate demands. All tenants, please wait for the authorities to provide fair relief. "Even if the seas run dry and the rocks crumble, this determination will not change." This is our declaration, and we hope for your public understanding.</p>

However, after repeated persuasion from friends, he was persuaded to perform at the Central Grand Theater once more, so that Mr. Zhang's amazing martial arts skills could be popularized. It is also heard that Mr. Zhang will add new programs to his performance at the Central Theater. The ticket prices for the Central Theater will be set at 60 cents, 80 cents, and one yuan, so that those who could not go to the Summer Place can also feast their eyes.</p>

<p>Letter</p>
<p>To the Editor: In the "Local News" column of your newspaper on the 29th of this month, there was a report that our bureau's "Shangjiang Wheel Emei, while traveling to Fengdu, crashed into a reef due to the captain's negligence. The bow of the ship was immediately broken, and the river water rushed into the front cabin, resulting in the front wheel sinking and the rear rising, which was quite dangerous. Fortunately, the captain urgently ordered the hole to be temporarily repaired, and the ship began to float on the river surface. The goods damaged by water are being checked." After investigation, our bureau's Emei Wheel passed through the Fengdu area, and was two or three miles away from the reef. The bottom of the ship was not broken, and the goods were not damaged by water. What was reported was probably hearsay. We are writing to inform you of this, and we hope you will investigate and correct it. Sincerely, Li Guojie, General Manager of China Merchants Bureau, May 30th.</p>

<h3 id="e190">The Garbage Problem and Shanghai Municipality <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Compiled by the Cleansing Division of the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau</p>
<p>The garbage problem arises with the population. Therefore, only large cities have this problem. Shanghai has a population of three million, and garbage has also become a major problem. To solve it is not easy. First, let's describe the methods of large European and American cities, and then discuss the solutions for this city. (1) Methods of disposal of garbage in European and American countries. Regarding the disposal of garbage, all major cities regard it as the most difficult event. Efforts and money are spent, but a thorough solution has not been achieved. European and American cities have spared no effort in research for decades, using machinery or chemistry, but they have never been satisfied. On average, each person discards about half a kilogram (about one pound) of waste every day. The more prosperous the city population, the more garbage is produced. Less is easy to dispose of, more is difficult to manage. For example, Shanghai has a population of three million, which means about 1,500 tons to 2,000 tons of garbage every day. Therefore, sweeping, collecting, transporting, and disposing of it cannot be adequately handled by a small number of people and a small amount of funds. (1) There are two methods for handling sweeping: (A) The local administrative agency handles it themselves, such as the method adopted by the Shanghai authorities. (B) The contractor system. (2) The methods for handling collection are no more than two: mixed collection and classified collection, which are determined by the method of disposal. (3) The method of transportation is either by vehicle or by boat, either self-operated or contracted. However, there are specially equipped vehicles and boats, with the aim of tightly packing and transporting to reduce the leakage of odors and debris. (4) There are many disposal methods, all of which are still in the testing period. Briefly describe them as follows: (A) Reduction. Using chemical methods, the useful oil in the pre-selected garbage is extracted, and the remaining can be used as fertilizer. (B) Incineration. The garbage is first selected and then burned in an incinerator. (C) Fermentation. The garbage must first be selected, and the fermentable animal and plant substances are placed in cement boxes to allow them to ferment and rot. The new product can be used as fertilizer. (D) Feeding. The edible parts are selected for feeding pigs. (E) Filling. Filling low-lying areas and dead canals, using waste to kill two birds with one stone. (F) Dumping on Land. Selecting a remote area in the city to dump and stockpile garbage. (G) Dumpug into Sea. Coastal cities can use ships to transport the garbage several miles outside the harbor and dump it into the sea. (H) Bural. Digging pits and pouring in garbage, covering it with soil. (I) Semerage. The pre-selected garbage is crushed into a slurry and mixed into the sewer for simultaneous disposal in the factory. The above methods have their advantages and disadvantages. Dumping is the most economical, but a single method cannot completely solve the disposal problem. At least one or two methods must assist each other to have hope of a solution. (2) Garbage situation in Shanghai. The garbage in Shanghai is collected in three places. The situation is listed below.</p>

<p>Population 1.88 million (January) 1 million 430,000</p>

<h3 id="e191">Financial: Yesterday's Gold Bar Fluctuations Trended Higher, Rebounding Three Taels and Two Mace <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>A Strong Downward Trend Was Observed the Day Before Yesterday</p>
<p>A Swing of Six Taels and a Half: Yesterday, the 31st, the gold bar market showed signs of a rebound, rising again. Although there were no drastic changes, there was a swing of six taels and a half throughout the day. Ultimately, it rebounded three taels and some odd change. With no trading in American silver, larger bars rose slightly, and the intentions of fellow traders remained firm, leading to a prompt price increase. Subsequently, there were favorable factors such as the British exchange rate easing and the American exchange rate holding firm. However, the cashiers of various firms varied in their practices, resulting in occasional fluctuations. The market trend seemed to weaken later, and the exchange rate eased slightly, hence the rise of three or four taels. Finally, it settled at 771.2 taels. Today (June 1st) is the time when the money industry closes its books at the end of May and takes a holiday, resulting in a city-wide market closure for one day. Detailed market conditions before and after are listed below:</p>
<p>The Morning Market Was Promising: From the opening at 7 AM, prices immediately rose by one tael, reaching 712.5 taels. The British silver rate remained unchanged in the near term and rose one-sixteenth in the long term. There was no market for silver prices, but buyers were active, and the opening price was high. Heng Yuanyuan, Heng Tai Chang, Yi Feng, and Yong Jun advanced. They then raised the price by more than two taels to fifteen taels. Yu He and Yuan Mao Yong Lai sold, immediately dropping one tael to thirteen taels and eight mace. However, British gold was absorbed by Mitsui at 1.79375 for July, and Citibank bought 31.375 for August. Zhifeng, Yong Qian, and Chang Xiang, among others, bought, immediately adding 2.9 taels at a quarter past the hour to reach 15.8 taels. However, British gold for June was available for purchase at 0.9375. Furthermore, there seemed to be more buyers than sellers of American gold for June at 0.625, which led to a decrease to 14 taels. The announcement of British gold remaining unchanged and American gold decreasing by 0.25, along with internal strengthening, with American gold for June trading at 30.05, especially with the eager purchases from Xie Xing Yong, Heng Xing Yuan, Hong Li, Heng Yu, Da De Cheng, Zhi Feng Yong, among others, caused the price to leap by more than two taels to 16.5 taels at 10:00 AM. Soon after, Yi Feng Yong, Bing Xing, Tong Tai Chang, Yuan Mao Yong, Yuan Yuan, Kang Xiang, Hong Kang, and Yong, among others, all sold. Furthermore, HSBC issued British gold for June and July at 8 pence, while American gold for September was available for sale at 31.6875 yuan. As a result, gold prices deteriorated, falling by five taels to 11.5 taels at 10:30 AM. After that, Yi Feng Yong, Da De Cheng, Yu He, and Fu Chang, among others, bought, raising it again to 14.2 taels. After 10:45 AM, Wan Xing Shun Li and retail investors came to sell, causing it to drop again by more than one tael to 12.7 taels at 11:00 AM, partly because Hua Bi absorbed British gold for July at 0.625 and American gold absorbed at 8 pence. With more buyers appearing on the surface, the price immediately surged by 2 taels to 14.5 taels after 11:30 AM. However, Heng Yu and others disposed of套頭物品 again, bringing it back to 13.2 taels. The noon closing price was 13.8 taels, and the announced price changed to 800 taels, with a discount of 85 to 86 taels to a noon closing of 86 taels.</p>
<p>The Afternoon Market Turned Weak: The afternoon market opened at 13.6 taels. Yi Feng then entered the market and bought British gold for August at 0.0625 and American gold for October at 31.875 yuan, absorbing it steadily. By around 2:30 PM, it was 14.4 taels. However, sellers did not slacken, with Zhi Feng Yong, Heng Yu, Hong Kang Yong, Bing Xing, and Yuan Mao Yong, among others, disposing of their holdings, especially due to the loose exchange market. Mitsui issued American gold for September at 31.75 yuan and British gold for June at 0.0625, seemingly requiring 1.875 to be sold in September, which led to a softening of the market. The price fell by more than four taels, to 10 taels at 3:00 PM (the lowest price of the day). Afterwards, Yi Feng and others bought again, bringing it to 13.5 taels at 3:40 PM. Fu Xing Yong and others sold, and British gold for August could be settled at 1.25, bringing it to 11.2 taels at 4:00 PM. General retail short sellers came to cover their positions, because today (June 1st) is a holiday and they needed to balance their accounts. As a result, it rebounded by two taels to 13.2 taels. By the closing at 4:30 PM, it was 12.7 taels, a rebound of 3.2 taels compared to the day before yesterday. However, Zhi Feng Yong and others sold again, falling back to slightly over 11 taels. The highest price of the day was 16.5 taels, and the lowest was 10 taels, a difference of 6.5 taels. The announced discount ranged from 90 taels to 87-88 taels. The recorded price was 14 taels, with a supplementary payment of 14 taels. The net red strip for the afternoon was calculated at 13 taels plus 8 taels and 7.5 mace.</p>
<p>Active Trading Among Firms: According to the statistics of transactions on the table, Qian Chang Xiang, Zhi Feng Yong, Heng Yu, Yuan Heng, Yuan Tai, Fu Tai Heng, Yi Feng Yong, Heng Xing Yuan, and Xie Xing Yong all bought. Shun Li, Tong Tai Chang, Hong Kang Yong, Wan Xing, Yuan Mao Yong, and Bing Xing all sold. In the afternoon, Yi Feng and Tong Tai Chang bought. Heng Yu, Da De Cheng, Bing Xing, Yuan Chun, and Fu Yu had mixed buying and selling. Yuan Mao Yong initially bought and then sold. Zhi Feng Yong, Hong Kang Yong, Cheng Da Yong, and Fu Xing Yong all sold. The Ningbo gang sold a total of more than 500 bars, and bought more than 200 bars. The Cantonese gang, such as Heng Xing, did not have any deposits or withdrawals. Yi Feng offset and deposited a total of 1,700 bars. It was found that the total number of chips at the exchange office at the end of the day before yesterday was approximately 23,000, slightly more than at the end of last week.</p>
<p>Supplementary Record of Market Conditions the Day Before Yesterday (May 30th): The gold exchange continued to operate as usual on May 30th. The condition of all gold bar prices was increasingly bearish, with extremely turbulent waves. The general situation of that day is supplemented as follows: The initial opening price for July was 718.5 taels, a slight increase of two mace. The silver market had risen slightly on Sunday (the 29th), and it was unaffected. Although there was the issue of the United States raising silver prices, the parliament had differing opinions, so there was no impact. It then reached 19.5 taels. Afterwards, because the exchange rate was quite loose, especially with large investors selling, and it was rumored that American gold was being shipped to London, people were terrified, and the price plummeted by more than ten taels, eventually reaching 703 taels. However, there was a sudden swing of several taels, and then it turned upwards, because general short sellers had a profit to gain and took the opportunity to cover their positions. Also, with the exchange rate peaceful, the money banks made some purchases, reaching 710.2 taels at nearly 10:00 AM. Shortly afterwards, it dropped by five or six taels to 04.5 taels. Afterwards, there was a rumor that a certain bank opened and deposited 315 bars of spot goods, and because buyers seemed to be restrained, it reached 08.8 taels. The noon closing price was 06.8 taels. The afternoon market was calm, initially opening at 06.5 taels, then ranging from 06 taels to 10.8 taels, then returning to 07.5 taels. The closing price was 709.5 taels, a fall of 8 taels and 8 mace compared to the end of last week. The highest price of the day was 19.5 taels, and the lowest was 03 taels, a difference of 16.5 taels. Transactions among fellow traders were mixed and varied.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Foreign Exchange: Sterling Weak, Dollar Strong <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>American Silver Merchants Enter the Market, Improving Conditions</p>
<p>Large Swaps: A Difference of 9.375</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silver market was mediocre and the exchange rate was neither prosperous nor unfavorable. It was also the American holiday. When HSBC posted its rates, the British gold rate was the same as before, remaining at 1 shilling and 7.5 pence. The American dollar rate decreased by 0.25, calculated at 30 yuan. The Hong Kong rate remained unchanged, calculated at 77.375 taels. The German exchange rate decreased slightly by 1.25 yuan, calculated at 126.5 marks. There were no other changes. However, the internal bank rates showed different trends, with sterling weak and the dollar strong. From the early morning, the sterling rate was initially flat and then eased, while the dollar rate was flat and then strengthened. Both showed easing in the afternoon. The gold market had an initially high and subsequently low performance, but there was no special contraction or expansion. The daily difference was only about six taels, ultimately rebounding three taels, which was a reversal after the disastrous fall the day before yesterday. The closing sterling rate was 0.0625 higher than the night before, while the dollar rate decreased by 0.25. Trading among Chinese merchants was not light, generally buying sterling and selling dollars to swap the British-American exchange rate. Occasionally, they would swap gold. However, the settlement price was greatly reduced, calculated at approximately 90 taels. The total transaction volume for sterling was 200,000 pounds, and banks also absorbed it. The volume of American dollars was approximately over 1 million yuan, with more selling than buying. It was heard that foreign merchants were settling their accounts, so market conditions improved.</p>
<p>British Exchange: The internal rate had a difference of 1.875 throughout the day. The near-term and far-term rates had a difference of 1.25. From the opening, the near-term selling price was 1 shilling and 7.875 pence, and the far-term price was 8 pence. The buying price was 7.9375 pence to 8.0625 pence. Mitsui entered at 7.9375 for July, and Zheng Jin and Hua Bi mutually traded June at the same price. HSBC issued 8 pence for June and July, and traded the same price with Hua Bi and Mitsui. Shanghai bought 0.0625 for July, and Hua Bi entered at the same price. Wheat Bank bought 8 pence for July. The noon closing selling price was 8 pence to 0.0625, and the buying price increased by 0.0625. In the afternoon, Hua Bi and Zheng Jin traded 0.0625 for August. Anda and Da Ying mutually traded 0.0625 for June. Taiwan bought 1.875 for September. Mitsui traded 0.0625 for June with Dong Fang. Hua Bi issued 1.875 for October (for swapping British-American exchange rates, calculated at 3 yuan and 8 jiao). Shanghai issued 1.25 for August, and Anda issued 1.25 for October (Cheng Feng Yong entered). The closing selling price was 8 pence to 1.25, and the buying price was 8 pence 0.0625 to 1.875.</p>
<p>American Exchange: The internal rate had occasional changes and was complex and indefinite. The swaps were very large. June and September had a difference of as much as 9.375. Generally, the farther the date, the looser the rate. From the opening, the selling price for June was approximately 31 yuan, July 0.25, August 0.5 yuan, September 31.75, and the buying price was 31.125 yuan to 31.875 yuan. Mitsui entered 31.375 for August. Shanghai entered 30.625 for June. Zhong Fu and Zhejiang traded at the same price. Wheat Bank and Mei Feng mutually traded 30.5 yuan for June. Zhong Fu entered 31.3125 for August. Mitsui and Hua Bi entered 31.625 for September. Hua Bi and Citibank entered 8.125 for October. Mitsubishi and Mitsui issued 31.75 for August.

The listed rate was 1 yuan, equivalent to 3 taels, 3 mace, and 3.33 fen.</p>

<h3 id="e194">Observation of the Silver and Foreign Exchange Market at the End of the Settlement Period <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>General Procedures Are Typically Cumbersome</p>
<p>Fractional Silver Was Stable, Copper Coins Rose Sharply</p>
<p>Market Overview: Yesterday was the end of the month, which is usually busier than usual. It was also the scheduled date for the year-end settlement, so the money shops and Chinese commercial banks had a lot of procedures for receiving, settling, sorting, and chasing debts. The situation in the market was intensified as a result. However, there was no time for market competition, so most market conditions did not have significant rises or falls. Only copper coins showed new price increases.</p>
<p>Fractional Silver Prices: The morning rate for "foreign fractional silver" was the same as the previous afternoon, at 6 qian, 9 fen, 8 li, 7 hao, and 5 si. The afternoon rate decreased slightly by 1 hao and 2 hu, to 6 qian, 9 fen, 8 li, 6 hao, and 2 hu. The result was no major increase or decrease. The "silver fractional silver" rate decreased slightly by 1 fen in the morning and afternoon compared to the previous day, only 2 fen, almost equivalent to borrowing for free. There was no possibility of adding water to the rate from beginning to end. Banks had a surprisingly large amount of funds, and the storage rates were ignored.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market Conditions: Small Jiangsu foreign coins fell by 1 or 2 li compared to the previous day, calculated at 6 qian and 3 li. Only 2,000 jiao were traded in the morning market, and the afternoon market was inactive, so there was no change. Small Guangdong foreign coins were 5 qian and 9 fen and 2 li in the morning market, and 5 qian and 9 fen and 1.75 li in the afternoon market. The result was also a small decrease of 2 li. There was strong trading, with 240,000 jiao in the morning market and 50,000 in the afternoon market. Copper coins increased in price due to a large number of coins being issued, and a new high market price of 423,500 wen was observed, unprecedented. More than 43,000 strings were traded. Silver and Foreign Exchange Inflows and Outflows: The amount of funds drawn from the market was 1.27 million in the morning, 50,000 in banknotes, 140,000 in banknotes outside the market, and 35,000 in checks. In the afternoon market, the amount of funds drawn was 865,000, 20,000 in banknotes, 70,000 in banknotes outside the market. Bank transactions were 900,000 in the morning and 400,000 in the afternoon. Fractional silver transactions in both markets were over 2 million. As for the various silver and money industries, there were too many inflows and outflows during the special periods of receiving, settling, and closing accounts, so it was not possible to accurately calculate all of them. Furthermore, the time was delayed, so it was even more difficult to interview, and this was omitted.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Securities: Financial Spot Prices Rose by Up to Five Yuan <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 31st), the trading conditions of the Chinese Commercial Securities Exchange market showed that there were still only sporadic spot goods entering and exiting. A total of 27,000 yuan was traded throughout the day. The futures market was still good, and the atmosphere of buyers and sellers was lively. It was estimated that over 2.8 million were opened in the morning market, but less than 2 million in the afternoon market. Statistics show that the total turnover for the whole day was 4.77 million, including nearly 1 million of consolidated tax, over 20,000 of rolling tobacco, and 400,000 to 500,000 of each of Salt Tax, Demobilization, 1920 Goodwill, and 1920 Customs. Other bonds were stable. As for the trend of various bond prices (due to the situation the day before yesterday), the people's hearts were optimistic and good, and they soared by about two yuan. Yesterday, however, the trend suddenly slowed down greatly. All parties believed that when there were no new changes in the bond market environment and the situation was still depressing, the people's hearts in the market were not as good as before. There were quite a few people in the market who took advantage of the rising prices to sell successively, so the trend in the morning was particularly sluggish, and at the close, there was once an oversupply, falling back by 3, 4 jiao to 1 yuan compared to the day before. However, although the price was inclined to be sluggish at that time, those who bought in at the same time were quite enthusiastic. Later, in the two afternoon sessions, the selling from the sellers became scarce, and the price recovered strongly, and gradually tended to rise in each session. As a result, except for rolling tobacco spot goods, which rose by 1 yuan and 4 jiao and a half compared to the previous day, the spot goods for Demobilization and 1920 Customs each rose by about 1 yuan, and most of the others were only about 3 or 4 jiao better. Only financial spot goods, which had not been traded for a long time, rose by as much as five yuan compared to before the suspension.

<p>Saturday, New York Stock Exchange, selling pressure was still strong at the opening, and later prices gradually strengthened. Industrial and public utility stocks both rebounded several points compared to the previous day, but railroad stocks continued to fall by 0.10 points. There was no directly related news on the market, but the reduction in the "General Electric" stock dividend had an impact on stock prices. There was no major change in the minds of traders, and the attention of all parties was still on how Congress would decide on the sales tax bill. The Dow Jones Index for Saturday is as follows:</p>

<p>Today, the Money Industry Closes Accounts, Yarn Trading Suspended</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market initially rose and then leveled off. However, the actual demand was good on the previous day for the South China route and the Sichuan gang's purchases. Today, the situation is flat again, so the market atmosphere is still harmonious. However, there is a small part because the stock of each factory has loosened more than before, and the existing yarn in the market is slightly tight, with intentions to see a high price. However, the economy in all directions is still dry, and it is difficult for business to develop. Therefore, each gang has no active purchasing power. Sporadic transactions may not be interrupted for a while. There is still no active news from North China, and the future situation is still one of hovering.</p>
<p>Bidding: Good in the Morning, Flat in the Afternoon: The opening of the initial bidding market, with the good sales of spot yarn on the previous day, there were more scattered investors in the market who were short, and each month rose by six or seven qian. Slightly fell in the second and third sessions. As a result, it rose one or two qian. The afternoon market was tired, and each month fell two or three qian. Statistics of the total transaction volume for the whole day: 8,200 bales. Check that Geng Feng sold 750 bales, Yuan Tai 300 bales, Tong Fu 200 bales, Da Chang 450 bales, Ji Feng 200 bales, Heng De 200 bales. Tai Chang bought 1,100 bales, Yi Chang 600 bales, Yuan Tai 450 bales, Xin Cheng 400 bales, Yuanda 200 bales. The closing price of the initial bidding is listed separately below.</p>

<p>August: 1551, Up 1, 21,600</p>
<p>The Spot Conversion for Two Days Is Still Active: The conversion of spot yarn is still good. Check that each gang bought statistics of 953 bales, the previous day was 1,566 bales. The market rose two qian and a half. The customer gang, Guangdong, entered 20 bales, Luzhou entered 25 bales, Xijin entered 60 bales, Fujian entered 2 bales, Zhenjiang entered 25 bales, Yunnan entered 60 bales, and Tongxingzhong entered 15 bales.</p>

<p>The cotton market situation is slightly looser, with gold prices flat and tired, and the fall in Indian cotton is drastic. The accounting calculation is very low, and people are afraid of emptiness. Moreover, there are trading companies and the Zhengzhou gang looking at the fall of foreign cotton, and the sales of this cotton are completely blocked by it. They only have to sell short in the futures market, but checking the number of bales sold short by each party is still small. However, buyers are still firm due to the cloudy weather and the great power of the Yangtze River. The current market can still be held back. In short, according to the world's general situation, there will be extremely big changes in the future.</p>
<p>Zheng Tagged Fell Two, Three, and Four Qian: The opening of the Zheng Tagged market was still good. Due to the cloudy weather, there were still many buyers of new flowers in October. Following that, there were realized short positions and falls in the second and third sessions, with each month falling one or two qian. The afternoon situation was still flat, and each month fell five fen to two qian again. Statistics of the total transaction volume for the whole day: 18,800 dan. Check that Heng Yi sold 1,200 dan, Mei Ji 400 dan, Yi Chang 700 dan, Chang Feng 800 dan, Rui Da 700 dan, Xin Cheng 700 dan.

<p>The position of this cotton is again encroached upon by Indian cotton, and the consumption of this cotton is blocked. However, a large batch of Indian cotton has invaded again, and will soon replace the host. Source: Yao Flower, 520 bales. The selling price is as follows:</p>

<p>There Is a Theory of Selling Stored Cotton in the South</p>
<p>New York, May 27th telegram, announcing the cotton market situation for the week, says: The spot cotton market has been uneven this week, and prices have a tendency to loosen, because the climate is suitable, and cotton crop development is relatively good. Also, because the tax problem is uncertain, and the trade report has not improved. Southern cotton factories, due to the accumulation of stored cotton or inventory, have slightly sold short, and the bulls have also slightly closed out, so New York has slightly risen in selling. The spot market situation in the South has not been weak, and the number of sales is still small. When the spot goods fall slightly, the shorts and fellow traders buy in, so they can maintain the popularity in the spot goods market. However, buyers would rather wait for others to sell than to seek to buy themselves. In several places in the cotton belt, the night temperature is quite low, and the rainfall is also excessive, resulting in the saying that cotton crop progress is slow. Some people also say that there is a need to replant, but the dry land in the eastern part of the cotton belt has seen rain, and the soil moisture is quite good.</p>

<p>Due to the unstable political situation last week, there were only three days of business. There were not many transactions during these three days, and most of the bulls closed out. Holders were firm because Japan had a lot of exports, but the selling intention of the Bai Luo Creek for July and August was very strong, so the profit of futures was far less than the spot market price. In terms of spot goods, Japan's purchasing appetite was still good. Appendix: Statistics for last week are as follows (unit: thousand bales)</p>

<p>The American An Cotton Bank, according to the New York telegram of May 26, says: Liverpool's liquidation number has been absorbed, most of which were entered by fellow traders. Speculative trading is not active. The East has a slight demand for spot cotton, and the scope of European demand is not large. The base price remains stable. Piece goods trade is sluggish. Domestic spinning industry is currently greatly reducing production. The new cotton crop is progressing smoothly, because the climate is suitable and development is good.</p>

<p>Few Cocoon Businesses, Small Cocoon Prices</p>
<p>Most Silkworm Farmers Self-Bake</p>
<p>In the towns and villages of Jiangning, many farmers now raise foreign seeds from the Breeding Improvement Association, so although the cocoon production is scarce, the cocoon quality is still good. However, no one has rented the cocoon businesses in the four villages, and only one in the urban area weighs and receives cocoons, and receives cocoons at a limited price. The highest price for high-quality cocoons is only 20 to 25 yuan, and the lowest is only 15 yuan. The silkworm farmers' losses are too great, and most use the native method to bake them in preparation for spinning native silk themselves. The cocoon market is desolate this time, and the impact on farmers and silkworms is extraordinary.</p>

<p>Tea from foreign firms in this port, particularly high-grade Qimen black tea, saw extremely high trading volumes in the past two days. Jardine Matheson, a British firm, was particularly aggressive in its purchases. The market remained quite firm. There were no transactions for Ningzhou and Wenzhou black teas. Zhenmei green tea from these areas also received no inquiries. New goods from Tunxi, Dongzhi, Lianxian, and other areas have been arriving in Shanghai steadily in recent days. Due to the impact of cheap Japanese Zhenmei tea competing for sales, these teas are experiencing extremely sluggish sales. Only needle-shaped tea saw some sporadic purchases from Jardine Matheson and Yongsheng, but even the selling price was down five to six taels compared to last week.</p>

<p>Two Thousand Tons of New Sixth-Month Siamese Xiaojiao</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market was quite active. There were outlets to various inland areas, Nanjing, Chongming, and local streets, with a total of around 20,000 units of spot goods traded throughout the day. With brisk trading, prices rose by ten cents and a fraction. Subsequent liquidation remained good, suggesting the possibility of further price increases. Specifically, 15,000 bags of Xiaojiao rice were offered at prices of 11.02 yuan, 10.97 yuan, and 10.68 yuan. Over 1,000 bags of Saigon No. 1 were priced at 11.75 yuan. More than 2,000 bags of Xiaojiao red rice were priced at 10.15 yuan. 1,000 bags of Calcutta rice were priced at 10.05 yuan. Additionally, a new batch of Wenzhou rice arrived, with 1,500 bags offered at prices ranging from 10.99 yuan to 10.62 yuan.</p>
<p>Expectations were for continued sales of foreign rice. The market was initially seen as weak, but due to active liquidation of spot goods, prices remained stable. Jardine Matheson offered 1,000 tons of Xiaojiao rice, weighed after June, at 5 taels and 1.5 qian. Yinhua &amp; Co. sold 500 tons through Xiangmao at 5 taels and 1.3 qian. Yuanxing offered 500 tons of Siamese japonica rice for June at 5 taels and 4 qian. Recycled goods included 600 tons of Xiaojiao rice for May, priced from 5 taels and 0.9 fen to 5 taels and 0.6 fen, all of which were purchased by local merchants.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the spot vermicelli market remained sluggish. The opening price the day before was only 2 taels and 0.035 yuan. Due to very quiet purchases from merchant guilds, despite bad weather, sentiment did not improve. Yesterday, due to weak merchant demand, market transactions were only sporadic, with no deals for entire thousands of bags. It was heard that Fuxin offered 5,000 bags at a price of 2 taels and 0.0375 yuan. There were no other transactions. However, Fuxin is still willing to repurchase the vermicelli it previously offered at the current price. The reason for this is currently difficult to speculate.</p>

<p>Due to the Stimulus of Guangdong Sales</p>
<p>Since the price of daylily fell, the lowest price at second-tier firms reached as low as 5 taels, which could be considered extremely cheap. Recently, Guangdong merchants, who had been inactive for a long time, suddenly became active in purchases. As a result, the extremely weak market suddenly rebounded, improving by two taels compared to before. Zhenbang's price board also tightened accordingly, invigorating the market. Although there is no excessive increase, it will not fall again. Yesterday, top-tier market daylily sold for around 17 taels, with upper-middle tiers selling from 12-13 taels down to 10 taels.</p>

<p>Yesterday at the Sugar Market Association, trading remained quiet, but market sentiment was firm. The supply of Dutch No. 24 raw and white granulated sugar was particularly tight, causing a slight increase in the market. The traded price for finely ground white granulated sugar was 13 taels and 5.75 qian, No. 20 medium white granulated sugar was 13 taels and 1.1 qian, and No. 18 was 13 taels and 0.05 qian. With both inflow and outflow limited, the market appears stable. Taikoo Sugar's CW mark was 15 taels and 8 qian, CX mark was 15 taels and 5.5 qian, H mark was 12 taels and 2 qian, and Qingdao-packed B mark was 16 taels and 3 qian. There was little trading, and the market was calm. The quotation board and other markets were even more quiet.</p>

<p>Trading of chess copper was very quiet before because the merchant guilds had stopped doing business. But recently, merchant guilds from Sichuan, Henan, Hankou, and other regions started doing business together, the market became active. The standard price was 185 taels per dan. It was heard that more than 140 dan were sold yesterday. However, the arrival of the next batch of goods is nowhere in sight. In addition, the settlement period has passed, and people's sentiment has relaxed. There is hope for the development of future trading.</p>

<p>—</p>
<p>When I was in Japan, I was very unconvinced about Japan. One day, our embassy held a grand banquet. Diplomats from various countries and prominent Japanese figures attended. It was lively and bustling. As a counselor, everyone asked me to say a few words. I thought diplomatic rhetoric should not offend people. So, I stood up and said:</p>
<p>"Not long ago, I traveled in Europe and saw the European political stage, which was truly colorful and fascinating. European politics is indeed more enlightened than that of the East. European society is indeed more advanced than that of the East. I couldn't help but admire what I saw!</p>
<p>"Now that I come to the East, I suddenly see a large mirror on this Eastern political stage that reflects the things on the Western stage exactly, vividly. I am even more surprised!</p>
<p>"It's like a student imitating a teacher, surpassing the teacher. If the teacher is good, the student is not bad either. Should I compliment the student or the teacher? I really feel a bit hesitant."</p>
<p>The applause was like thunder. Many foreigners in the diplomatic corps specifically came forward to shake my hand and congratulate me. The Japanese guests could not help but smile and nod.</p>

<p>— Yu Jianhua</p>
<p>The Shanghai battle has lasted more than a month. A kind of Liu Bowen stele was suddenly discovered on the streets. It spoke of this incident as being in accordance with its predictions. Newspaper vendors seized the opportunity to reprint it, and it became popular for a while. Everything it said had already been fulfilled. Only the last two lines, "Reversing the tide on January 29th, witnessing the sun set in the West," have not yet been precisely identified. However, although the Shanghai Incident is said to have started on January 28th, it actually started late at night. The actual contact, however, was on January 29th. Moreover, the troops resisting Japan alone happened to be the 19th Route Army. Many people say that the 19th Route Army's uprising on January 29th was an opportunity for China to be reborn, enough to reverse the will of Heaven. By the time the National Army retreated to the second line of defense due to lack of support, the nation's passionate hope dissolved like ice and snow. Then, on April 29th, just when the Japanese army was elated, there was a sudden loud noise. Yin Bong-gil's bomb wiped out Japanese army dignitaries, causing numerous deaths and injuries. Currently, our country is holding a memorial service for the fallen soldiers in Suzhou, bringing matters to a close. Shirakawa has already died from his injuries and his body has been transported back to his country. The day of his arrival in the country also happened to be May 29th. The beginning and end of the war are both inseparable from the number 29. Is there then a fate related to this number? However, victory or defeat depends on making every effort. One should not rely solely on fate to comfort oneself, suppress one's fighting spirit, and hinder one's progress.</p>

<p>Someone said, "The nation is in such a dire situation, with national demise imminent. Yet you say the nation is beyond saving. Are you not insane?" I said, "Yes, yes, no, no. If one could follow even one of my proposed five methods, the nation would indeed be beyond saving! The methods are simple, and the implementation is easy, but they are not known to you and are not what the virtuous and talented of the party-state like to hear. What are these methods? It is the transformation of the heart! Please allow me to explain my methods":</p>
<p>(1) To use the heart of civil war, full of bravery, against foreign enemies will render the nation beyond saving.</p>
<p>(2) To use the heart of deceiving the people, full of cunning, in diplomacy will render the nation beyond saving.</p>
<p>(3) To use the heart of non-resistance, full of cowardice, in civil war will render the nation beyond saving.</p>
<p>(4) To use the heart of plundering, full of selfish desires, in national defense will render the nation beyond saving.</p>
<p>(5) To use the heart of diplomacy, full of gentleness, in uniting the people will render the nation beyond saving.</p>
<p>That person clapped his hands with tears in his eyes and retreated.</p>

<p>Recently, the domestic film industry has been following almost the same path, which is love movies. Zhang San loves Li Si, and Li Si reforms. It's all the same, and it's getting a little annoying. Sometimes there are some different plots, but most of them are descriptions of the aristocratic class. Film art has simply become entertainment for young masters and misses. Tianyi Company's new sound film "A Married Woman" depicts a poor working-class couple who suffer from the pressures of making a living. The wife is also seduced by a wealthy young man, eventually falling from grace. As a result, both the worker and the wealthy young man are tragically killed. The plot is very intense and exciting, and the actors are well-chosen (starring Xuan Jinglin, Sun Min, Zhang Zhenduo, and Li Lilian). Their expressions are realistic, adding many touching elements.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the film was previewed at the New Light Grand Theater. After watching it, I was very moved. I felt that the plot of the film completely broke away from the usual nauseating love stories. It tasted different. In this era, this kind of film that speaks for the common people is very valuable. I think enthusiastic friends will definitely sympathize with this poor "Married Woman," right?</p>

<p>A Wonderful Painting Reunited – About five hundred years ago, there was an unknown French painter who painted a wonderful painting of the Great Flood from ancient times. This painting was very, very large and painted with great detail. After it was finished, it was cut into four pieces. But each piece could stand alone and become a very good painting. After many years, these four pieces of painting were scattered. One piece was displayed in the Louvre Museum in Paris, France. The whereabouts of the other three pieces were unknown. Later, after much effort, it was discovered that the second piece was in Amsterdam, the capital of the Netherlands, the third piece was in Brussels, the capital of Belgium, and the fourth piece was in England and was privately owned. Each of these four pieces of painting had a photograph. When put together, they were indeed a complete painting. Two years ago, an exhibition was held in Paris, where these four pieces of painting were brought together. It was truly a rare masterpiece. Recently, a French painting exhibition was held in London, where this painting, reunited after being separated, was displayed again for the public to enjoy.</p>

<p>A foreigner once criticized, "Russia is a place where there is always happiness and people can meet with happiness everywhere. If a Russian can get a piece of white bread, or three yards of coarse cloth, or a pair of socks, this will be the seed of his happiness." People like us who have tightened to the extreme, without food when hungry and without clothes when cold, feel happy when we get every small object, so we think his words are correct.</p>
<p>Today I did something very happy. I bought a pair of rubber shoes for twelve rubles. (They used to cost only one ruble and twenty kopecks.) But first I had to hand over three pairs of old shoes and pre-write a receipt, and when I picked up the shoes, I used this receipt and twelve rubles to exchange for them. Now it's spring, and the weather is humid. We certainly have to protect the hygiene of our feet, so I bought a pair for the price of twelve rubles. To be honest, our only industry now is health. Besides that, everything else has been seized by the government. But then again, I always feel that it is much better than the workers in capitalist countries, working with empty stomachs in the iron grip of capitalists. In other words, we will not lose our jobs or go hungry, even though we are so painful.</p>
<p>The most interesting thing in Moscow is a kind of aristocratic joint store with the words "This store only accepts cash or foreign currency" written at the door. This is written in Russian. Foreigners who don't know Russian will of course not understand, so there is a doorman who whispers to customers when they enter the door, "Only gold or foreign currency." This method of collecting cash from the people often stirs people's emotions and makes them uneasy. And these stores sell daily necessities, so there are some people who really have no other way but to take their last wedding gold ring or gold cross and exchange it for a shirt, a pair of shoes, or a bedspread, etc. The price is extremely high. Shoes that cost one hundred and seventy rubles elsewhere can be sold for three or four foreign dollars in these stores. What we get as salary is paper money, but when we buy things, we know we have to pay cash or foreign currency. Do you think there is any other country's people besides the Russian people who can endure this? We are all forced to work desperately, dumping the goods we have worked hard to create to foreign countries, so that the country can collect as much cash as possible from foreign countries and concentrate it in Russia, which excites people with revolutions around the world. What benefits do we people know about?</p>
<h3 id="e218">Random Notes on the Memorial Service for the Fallen Soldiers in the Battle of Shanghai <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>The Grand and Solemn Venue On May 28th, the weather was slightly overcast, neither hot nor cold; it was as if Heaven also deliberately showed its dim and sorrowful face to mourn the anti-Japanese generals and soldiers who sacrificed their heads and shed their blood for the country's survival and the nation's glory. The venue was the Wang Feiji Public Sports Field in the city. In front of the gate and on the altar in the center, there were white and blue memorial arches, tall and magnificent, which truly represented the personalities and spirits of the martyrs. Around the venue, Boy Scouts and military police were strictly stationed. There were three entrances and exits to the venue, and the entry and exit of the public groups and the army were not mixed, and the order was well maintained. The preparatory committee pre-made various badges. Only those who wore badges were allowed to enter the venue. Only those who wore yellow badges were allowed to go directly to the altar. The memorial service was scheduled to begin at ten o'clock, but by nine o'clock, representatives from all over the country and various organizations in the city, American expatriates, etc., had almost filled the venue; and the public without badges, surrounded outside the venue, numbered no less than 30,000 to 50,000 people. What a grand occasion! The presidium consisted of Chen Mingshu, Dai Ji, Cai Tingkai, Jiang Guangnai, and Zhang Zhizhong. The chief officiant was Ju Zheng, and the general commander of the venue was Weng Zhaoyuan, who steadfastly defended Wusong. Unfortunately, the reporter was far away from the altar, and the faces of the dignitaries could not be seen clearly, and the speeches could not be heard either.</p>
<p>The Dense Couplets and Elegiac Scrolls Around the venue, bamboo racks were pre-erected, covered with elegiac scrolls, the number of which was countless. If they were connected end to end and stretched, they could reach the station directly. The witty remarks in the couplets were also endless. If they could be compiled and published, it would be of permanent commemorative value. A couplet by Zhang Junsong, the head of the 156th Brigade at the main entrance, was magnificent and worth reciting, and is specially recorded as follows: "They are the pillars of the country and the vanguards of the nation, swallowing the Dwarf bandits, and their divine bravery far shakes the whole world!" "Sacrificing for justice and fighting for peace, their blood splashed on the Shanghai wilderness, and their loyal souls will forever surround the Great Jiangnan!" Other silver shields and wreaths piled up. In addition to sending more than 300 yuan in condolences, our Soochow University also joined other church schools to send a large silver shield, engraved with the twelve characters "The blood of the martyrs, the soul of the Chinese nation, lasts forever, and their noble spirit exists!" As for the propaganda printed matter, it was flying everywhere, and there were various kinds. The preparatory committee produced a memorial publication, which listed the names and resumes of the dead and wounded officers and soldiers in great detail. Unfortunately, the reporter followed the Soochow University team from the side door and could not obtain it. I borrowed it once and recorded the casualty table on the left:</p>
<p>Casualties of Officers and Soldiers in the Anti-Japanese War of the 19th Army and the 5th Army</p>
<p>Wounded in battle Dead in battle Remarks</p>
<p>Unit Rank and file Soldiers Rank and file Soldiers</p>
<p>19th Army 60th Division 92 1175 26 368</p>

<p>78th Division 114 1965 45 1118</p>
<p>5th Army 87th Division 101 1340 24 499</p>
<p>The casualties of the Military Academy and the Training Corps include 14 officers and 281 missing soldiers inside and outside the country.</p>
<p>88th Division 141 1557 57 1034</p>
<p>The number of missing officers in the 88th Division Independent Brigade 2nd Regiment is 12 officers and 318 missing soldiers.</p>
<p>34 314 16 195</p>
<p>Total 677 9153 214 4057</p>
<p>Note: The Volunteer Army and the Gendarmerie Regiment, the Electric Ray Team, the Railway Artillery Team, etc. are not included in this table.</p>
<p>Respectable and Lovely Glorious Warriors On that day, about three regiments of soldiers from the 19th Army and about one regiment from the 5th Army participated. The officers and soldiers of the 5th Army wore yellow woolen uniforms, neat and solemn, with robust bodies and full spirits; the 19th Army wore blue-grey cloth uniforms, short pants exposing their knees, and wore the glorious and supreme 19th Route Army battle hats, which were admired by foreigners (it is said that this battle hat has been carried by Americans to their country and placed in the museum). Although their stature was shorter, they were brave and lively, which truly represented the national soul of our Chinese nation. As the reporter passed by them, his blood boiled and his spirit moved. He not only changed the past psychology of hating soldiers because of hating civil wars, but also wanted to pay homage to these sacred warriors who defended the country and loved the people! A Tragic and Passionate Atmosphere In addition to being filled with a solemn and tragic atmosphere, the venue had a gratifying phenomenon. That is, 99% of the men and women participating in the memorial service in the entire venue, whether in uniforms or casual clothes, were wearing domestic cloth and silk. Occasionally, one or two so-called modern men and women who usually wear imported goods to show off their beauty were overshadowed at this time and felt ashamed. The reporter believes that if this phenomenon can be popularized outside the venue and continue permanently, it will be the only panacea to save our dying national destiny! This is the responsibility that all of our people should fulfill, and it is easy to do if we are determined. If we cannot sacrifice and eliminate the psychology of admiring foreign goods, then how can we face the fallen generals and soldiers who donated their lives and abandoned their homes? I now respectfully ask the gentlemen of the government, the leaders of society, and the educated young students to take the lead in advocating this only panacea for resurrection!</p>
<p>Contributions of Personal Feelings Alas! The dead are gone! What contributions will those who die later make? The lost land in the Northeast has not been recovered, and what will be the reliance of the martyrs' families? I heard from a certain soldier who participated in the war that the government's treasury is exhausted, and the pensions for the fallen generals and soldiers have not been issued to this day. The martyrs regarded death as going home and died in the right place; however, their widows and orphans, and their elderly parents, have lost their support. How will they make a living? To put it simply, our lives and property have been preserved by the blood of the soldiers, and we should not indifferently forget these widows and orphans without thinking of how to repay them? As the reporter puts pen to paper, he wishes to dedicate his sincerity to encourage all his compatriots!

<h3 id="e219">Women Smoking and Morality <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Songlu</p>
<p>According to the Tokyo dispatch of the World Society yesterday, the government's tobacco monopoly bureau recently announced the sale of a new type of cigarette specifically for women, which has aroused great opposition from the female community. Various women's groups have sent representatives to visit the bureau chief, saying that this move is tantamount to the government encouraging women to smoke, hindering social morality, and demanding the cancellation of the new cigarette sales plan.</p>
<p>Whether women smoking is related to morality is indeed an interesting question worth studying. Originally, cigarettes are harmful and useless, which no one can deny. What we want to study now are two questions: one is whether women can smoke, and the other is whether women smoking is related to morality.</p>
<p>Regarding whether women can smoke, I think it is absolutely possible, because according to the principle of equality between men and women, if men can smoke, why can't women? Regarding morality, according to this principle, it is the same. If men smoking has nothing to do with morality, how can women smoking be related to morality? Could it be that bad morality can only be promoted by men, and women cannot emulate it?</p>
<p>This article is originally about Japanese affairs, which is not related to us, and we don't need to speak for the Japanese authorities. However, the trend of women smoking cigarettes in our country is probably more serious than in Japan. From aristocratic ladies to common women, they all have the idea of "a cigarette after a meal is like living a god." Although women smoking cigarettes is not prohibited by law, it still creates a non-benevolent habit. From a moral point of view, it is always better to try to eliminate it. Originally, women's consumables are already too many. If we really talk about the reason for equal consumption, it is not an exaggeration to not allow women to smoke, because they consume more than men in makeup and clothing. Let's leave the smoking matter to men's "patent."</p>
<p>However, from a proper principle, not only should women smoking be opposed, but also men smoking should not be allowed. It is really "laborious and costly" and results in no benefits at all, but is harmful to health. Why bother?</p>

<p>— Chen Baoren</p>
<p>Half of the southeast has been washed by war, enduring to see the old mountains and rivers. After the battlefield war, there are remnants of hills, lamenting the passing waves of the sea. Dejected, the insects and sand lament the great calamity, and the desolate home is full of tears. The most heartbreaking is the Wusong willow, quietly standing in the east wind, calling what to do.</p>
<h3 id="e221">Same as Above <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Gu Zuliang</p>
<p>When the peace agreement was reached, the weapons were laid down together, but the broken ruins were no longer the old mountains and rivers. The enemy cavalry retreated, leaving behind traces of destruction. Pleasure boats return, mourning the green waves. The battlefield is desolate with few people, and the concessions are prosperous with many pipes. Even if one survives after the calamity, what about the unhealed wounds?</p>

<h3 id="e222">Glycerin <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Commoner</p>
<p>Glycerin has extremely wide uses in industry. Here, its properties, manufacturing methods, and uses are described separately as follows:</p>
<p>Glycerin is a colorless, viscous liquid with a sweet taste. In Western languages, it is called Glycerin. Its molecular formula is C3H8O3. It belongs to the trihydric alcohol group in organic substances. In its pure state, it crystallizes at 17 degrees Celsius and boils at 290 degrees Celsius. The human body contains a small amount in the blood. Lecithin and fat in the brain are both compounds of glycerin. Industrially, various vegetable oils and fats are used, and methods are devised to decompose them into fatty acids and glycerin. Fatty acids are the main raw material for making candles. Sodium and potassium salts of fatty acids are soap. Therefore, the by-products of candle factories and soap factories become the major source of glycerin.</p>
<p>There are various methods for obtaining glycerin from animal and vegetable oils and fats: (1) Adding clean water and a small amount of catalyst, such as lime or zinc oxide, to the fat. These can all be used as catalysts for decomposing oils and fats. Then, heating this mixture under high pressure of six to eight times atmospheric pressure to 170 degrees Celsius, the oils and fats decompose into fatty acids and glycerin. (2) Adding a type of yeast to the water-containing mixture of oils and fats. This yeast is usually extracted from castor seeds. Then, adding a small amount of acid to make it slightly acidic, and heating to 40 degrees Celsius, the oils and fats will spontaneously decompose. (3) Adding concentrated sulfuric acid or caustic soda, or caustic potash, to the oils and fats, and then heating and boiling it, glycerin can also decompose freely. This method was commonly used by candle factories and soap factories in the past. (4) Recently, some people have used sulfonic acid and sulfonic acid derivatives as catalysts, adding them to the oils and fats, and then adding a small amount of clean water, heating to 100 degrees Celsius, glycerin will spontaneously precipitate out. According to the first and fourth methods, the glycerin obtained is very pure, which is the new method that is currently popular. During the European War, the glycerin needed by the Germans was used for manufacturing explosives. The supply could not meet the demand. The German, Constan, greatly improved the yeast in the second method. First, he used starch to make sugar, and then added an equal amount of sodium sulfite and yeast to the sugar to ferment it. This could reduce the production of alcohol from 40 percent to 23 percent, and increase the production of glycerin from 11 percent to 27 percent. Unfortunately, the cost of this method was too high, losing its market competitiveness, and it is still not used by industrialists.</p>
<p>The biggest use of glycerin in industry is for making explosives. The famous Dynamite is made by absorbing nitrated glycerin into fine sand powder. For its manufacturing method, please refer to this column of this newspaper on the 13th of this month. In addition, cosmetics, such as lipstick, hair gel, hair oil, mouthwash, toothpaste, etc., used by women, all contain it. In medicine, it can be made into ointments and used in winter to prevent skin from freezing and cracking, as well as for moisturizing the skin. It is also not easy to dry out. When mixed with rosin, sesame oil, beeswax, etc., it can be made into indoor mosquito-catching glue. When mixed with formalin, it can be used to kill insects in orchards. Other things like typewriter ribbons, carbon paper, stamp pads, printing ink, etc., are all mixtures of glycerin and color pigments. Glycerin liquid has elasticity, so recoil mechanisms for guns and hydraulic machines also use it. If glycerin is mixed with potassium soap solution and turpentine to wipe glass windows, water vapor will not condense on them in winter and obstruct visibility. Therefore, aviators must first wipe their glasses with glycerin soap before flying. It is also used for glazing cotton yarn, preventing water in gas meters from freezing, and blending various food and wine flavors. Finally, glycerin mixed with lead oxide powder is the best adhesive for metal, stone, and glass.</p>

<p>— Zewei</p>
<p>The principal of F Middle School is a person who greatly admires Westernization. He is particularly proficient in English, so he specially hired a young American female teacher to teach the English course for Class A of the second year of junior high school. This female teacher is very young, only about twenty years old. She especially likes to dress up in colorful clothes. Every time she comes to the classroom to teach, the classroom is immediately filled with an incredible fragrance, almost anesthetizing the whole body.</p>
<p>Mister K is the best in English in his grade. None of the students in the whole grade can compare with him. When it comes to conversation, he is truly fluent and familiar with the subject matter. Therefore, the young female teacher likes him very much.</p>
<p>K's seat is in the front row, very close to the podium. One day, it was English class again. Other students hate English very much, but K is always delighted whenever it is English class. Before the class bell even rang, K was already sitting at his desk.</p>
<p>"Ding-ling! Ding-ling! Ding-ling! : : :"</p>
<p>The class bell rang, and the students gradually walked into the classroom from outside. The young female teacher, holding a foreign book, also walked in afterward.</p>
<p>"Old K, today is your lucky day again. Even I am benefiting from that fragrant scent!" T, who was sitting in the row behind K, gently kicked K's chair as he said this.</p>
<p>"You smooth-talker," K said with a smile and scolding tone.</p>
<p>After taking attendance, the female teacher taught a lesson and then smiled and pointed at K to explain a passage. K listened as if he had received an imperial decree, and quickly stood up, holding the book and began to explain it with a murmur. The female teacher walked off the podium and sat on K's desk, listening to his explanation. T, who was behind K, was already intoxicated.</p>
<p>After K finished explaining the book, the female teacher put down the book, pointed to a word with her right finger, while stroking K's hair, and said in the local language.</p>
<p>"You mispronounced this word. It should be read with a high tone, but you read it with a low tone." As she spoke, her head was almost leaning against K's head.</p>
<p>At this time, K had no mind to listen to her explanation at all, and was already anesthetized and his whole body was weak.</p>
<p>The bell for the end of class interrupted K's opportunity to enjoy his good fortune. Many students rushed out of the classroom before the teacher could leave. The young female teacher also left gracefully with her book. T, D, and S, who were next to K, came over with giggles. D said: "K, congratulations, that Miss is in love with you!"</p>
<p>"Don't talk nonsense," K said, "Did you see it?" "Oh my! The foreign son-in-law has a big attitude," S said, clapping his hands.</p>
<p>K suddenly stood up and ran out of the classroom. So, many students kept shouting, "Foreign son-in-law!"</p>
<p>Nonsense</p>

<p>— I</p>
<p>A: I heard that you have been frequently publishing some "literary" "small talks" in newspapers recently. Is that true?</p>
<p>B: Yes, yes, and sometimes I "casually talk" about "science" too. But they are all "nonsensical" things, and I still need Mr. Qing to give me some guidance. A: Easy, easy! Like your previous book "Tan Ying," it is enough of a warning to those who "live in a drunken dream." But, "alas! The state of the world is declining, what is the use of talking!" B: Yes. There is really no way to help those who are "beyond help." But articles like "School Scene Snapshots," I think, at least have some remedial effect for students, right?</p>
<p>A: That's certainly true. For example, there are many "unimaginable" things in "streets and alleys." Logically, we should "expose their tricks" and see if they are "ashamed" or not?</p>
<p>B: Exactly, even if it is just "a scale or a claw," we should "record everything we hear."</p>
<p>A: That's exactly what I mean! As long as it is a problem that occurs in "a corner of society," no matter "east, west, south, or north," even if it is just "bamboo scraps and wood chips," we must analyze it to see "why?" it is like this, and where the root cause lies.</p>
<p>B: Absolutely, absolutely. From national affairs to "market news," everything is worth our attention.</p>
<p>A: However, some people only talk about "movies" or "sexual issues," which is really "inexplicable."</p>
<p>B: That's true, but what can we do for the "bread problem"?</p>
<p>A: So, you yourself are writing articles for a living? That's "utterly absurd."</p>
<p>B: Actually, we are all "without a way out"! You don't have to criticize others.</p>
<p>A: No, you are really "pitiable!"</p>
<p>B: However, you also seem to be very serious, which is also "laughable!"</p>

<p>Lu Wenzhong's Miraculous Security Water. Lu Wenzhong's Miraculous Security Water, generally distributed by Lianyi Trading Company at No. 474 Nanjing Road, is a secret formula obtained by Mr. Lu. He has been formulating and distributing it for years. It has been incredibly effective in treating epidemics. After more than ten years of treatment effectiveness and research, it is now being made public. At the cost of huge sums of money, it is carefully produced according to the formula. As summer approaches and epidemics gradually arise, charitable people from this city and other ports are ordering it one after another for distribution.</p>
<p>Letter Received: To the Editor, I recently saw a column on chemistry in the Shanghai Zengkan of your newspaper on May 24th, which was on glass etching in chemical art and small industries. The mixture of calcium fluoride and sulfuric acid, which is its main raw material, is extremely poisonous. If it touches the skin, it will cause incurable ulcers. I hope this can be published in the newspaper so that those who try it can be careful. If you are exposed to this substance, wash it off with water within two or three seconds to avoid this danger.
