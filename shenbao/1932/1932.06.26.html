<p>時評</p>
<h3>對日外交方針之商榷</h3>
<p>— 彬</p>
<p>東北淪亡迄今。歷時已逾半載。政府始則日徒呼助於國聯。夢想列强主持「公道。」坐使日人得以從容囊括三省。一手造成所謂满洲僞國。旣不作收回失地討伐僞國之準備。復不能運用外交手腕以外交方式求其解决。九閱月來。無一貫之應付方針。尤無一貫之外交政策。遂令東北半壁山河。淪亡於不知不覺。至今山海關頭。黻旗飘揚。長白原野。敵騎縱橫。此誠爲我人民所痛心疾首而不能一日忘者也。</p>
<p>邇近國人痛失地收回之無日。覺長此延擱之非計。多主從速確定對日外交方針。明示態度。急謀東北問題之解决。至於方針究如何確立。則有主張接受日本前任幣原外相提出之五項基本原則。據以開始與日作解决東北問題之直接協商者。亦有主張根本承認民四日人迫我訂立之二十一條。依據實情求實際之解决者。胡適氏最近在獨立評論上則更主張。「由中國自動提出解除東三省軍備。中日俄皆不得在東三省駐軍。」「由兩國鐵路專家會議。依據現有各種條約。作切合事實的協商。以解决鐵道的爭議。」「中日兩國締結的新條約。不但應該解决積年久懸的爭端。并且應該遠矚將來確立遠東兩大民族可以實行共存共榮的基礎。」等對日久交網領九項。此種主張。要皆出於愛國憂國之至誠。要皆爲熱忱謀國。但吾人則認爲對日方針固應從速確立。而上述之外交方針。則多未敢苟同。爰陳所見。藉資商榷。</p>
<p>吾人認爲在討論對日外交方針之先。應先一審視日人之態度。換言之。即應一審視日人最近之對華政策。脫其對華政策爲轉趨於緩和。則我屈意遷就。承認日人一切不正當之權益。容或有使東北問題獲得解决之可能。反之。脫其爲强硬。則吾人縱拱手以東北奉送。恐亦無以满足其慾壑。而遏止其侵略之野心。日人最近之對華政　　　　乎。在外交時報中。最近曾刋載一代表日本軍人之主張曰。</p>
<p>「日本不僅是繼續占領满洲。且無論可時何地。都可發生第二第三的上海事件。這是中國所應該覺悟的。：：所謂肉彈三勇士。爲擊潰十九路軍的機緣。應爲華人所共知。假如日本六千萬國民都爲肉彈三勇士。則其將惹起何種事態。恐難預料。或者閘北的慘狀。將擴大到中國全土。十九路軍的毁滅將爲中國全國民之命運的象徵。從對華事變爆發。臨時支出軍費已逹二億數千萬元。但兩次帝國會議。兩院議員竟没一人表示反對。也没有人要求削减一元。政府財政困窘已極。國民亦多爲不景氣所苦悶。農村更陷於死綫上。但亦都欣然贊成協助鉅額的對華事變費用。而且爲了满洲問題。今後還有支出幾億軍費的準備。同時更視世界的趨勢如何。或將以世界强國爲對手。以貫澈我們的主張。在此主張貫澈實現之前。將來發生數次上海事件。當然亦早在我們計算之中。」</p>
<p>吾人試一細味此論。則其氣勢之咄咄逼人。直令人毛髮爲豎。所謂「爲了满洲問題。今後還有支出幾億軍費的準備。」及「以世界强國爲對手。以貫澈我們的主張。」其對華政策之益趨於强硬蓋至爲顯明。再就目前日本法西運動之激化。對華貫澈强硬之呼聲。與日衆議院决議從速承認满洲僞國。及日政府拒絶顧維鈞氏柬渡等種種事實而觀。更可知日本於東北現成之局面。决無改變之可能。而且其勃勃野心。正如野馬脫韁怒馳。靡有止極。抑且東北之淪亡。爲日明治大帝遺策之賢行。亦即日人數十年來侵略計劃之實現。故其佔據東北。實非偶發之暴舉。彼方準備掀起第二第三之滬變。方準備更進一步之侵略計劃。我乃欲以委曲求全之外交方針。求東北問題之完满解决。是果可能耶。是果爲踐實有效之主張耶。吾人固不能不一爲周詳考慮也。至對日外方針。究應如何。容續爲文論之。</p>

<p>（大連）大連海關長福本昨日下午由上海總稅務司梅樂和接到革職電報、即將一切事務委交高級職員中野代辦、福本本日對記者謂、電文未述革職理由、據余想像或因停止解欵以致違反命令、余恐解欵之結果、惹起國際問題、故採臨時應急之辦法而已、稅務司之革職、從來未有此例、今後無論何人繼任事務、不免發生紛糾云、（二十五日日聯社電）</p>

<p>（東京）聞「满洲國」當道現切實準備、如大連稅欵不解交長春、即在關東租借地邊界瓦房店地方、設立稅關、此間官塲聞此消息、爲之不寗、蓋以此舉、將造成兩重關稅也、非官塲之注視時局者、以爲大連稅務司福本之褫職適開日本「满洲國政府」談判東三省稅關全部問題之門、此日政府之所以向中政府聲明苟因此而有任何發展則由中國負責也、雖傳說在李頓調查圑報告未發表時、日本未必承認新「满洲國」、但衆料内田大約將於七月五日就外相職、其就職後第一舉動、將爲發表文告、說明日本在東三省之意見、（二十五日路透社電）</p>

<p>二一技谭</p>
<h3>了不得與不得了</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>我國社會爲什麽没有進步？政治爲什麽不上軌道？其中的弊病，千端萬緒，這不是本欄一個小小的方框子裏所說得盡的！没奈何，只好說幾句扼要的話：</p>
<p>（一）了不得的人太少，不得了的人太多！</p>
<p>（二）有了一個了不得的人，便有話多不得了的人應聲而起！</p>
<p>（三）少數了不得的人，給多數不得了的人包圍了；結果，了不得的人，竟溶解在不得了的烘爐中，而起了同化作用！</p>
<p>以上的舉例，我可逐一的簡單說明：</p>
<p>（一）衆人眼光中的特别人物，震而驚之，喚一聲了不得！或者、紅的了不得！或者，闊的了不得！或者，名望響亮的了不得！反轉來說，衆人眼光中的蹩脚人物，哀而賤之，喚一聲不得了！或者，黑的不得了！或者，窮的不得了！或者，没精打采的不得了！倘把了不得與不得了的數量，比較一下；了不得的人物，千中難得一，不得了的人物，千中倒有九百九十九個半。</p>
<p>（二）有了一個了不得的人物，許多不得了的親戚故舊，都來附鳳，攀龍，依草，附木；把這個了不得的人物，重重疊疊包圍在許多不得了的親戚故舊裏面！</p>
<p>（三）假使，了不得的人物，志在維持他了不得的三字榮譽；非得打破重重疊疊的不得了不可！但是，打破二字，談何容易，寛一步說：朋友的包圍，可以打破；親戚的不得了，便打不破了！再寛一步說：娘親爺眷的包圍，可以打破；裙帶關係的不得了，便打不破了！爲這分上，了不得的榮譽，竟溶解在不得了的洪爐裏面，而起了同化作用！從前了不得的，現在也變做不得了的了！</p>
<p>了不得的銳減，不得了的激增，社會那裏會進步？政治那裏會上軌道？唉！這便成了一個不得了的中華民國！</p>
<h3>悲畸零人王寂紅之死</h3>
<p>— 棉子</p>
<p>在早幾年前的上海。每逢有什麽音樂的集會。總能聽得到五寂紅的琵琶。其技藝的超俗。態度的靜默。提起來或許也有一部份人能夠回憶到當時情景。而留下一些影痕的吧。自從三角戀愛發生之後。琵琶的聲音就戞然終止了。現在竟成絶響。能不令人欷歔嘆息呢。他死得眞是凄凉。當一二八滬變事發。他因愛好大自然的美麗。就漂泊到安徽黃山的硃砂菴去居住。領略那奇秀雄偉的山水。誰知抱着肺癆的他。在深山古廟裏因爲營養和環境的不良。就此侘傺着與世長辭了。身後蕭條。没有親友。還是一位老和尙替他理葬的。這消息傳到之後。凡是生前和他相識的人。誰不酸辛。尤其是朝夕相聚的朋友。更覺得悲哀欲淚啊。</p>
<p>他是一個很聰明的青年。對於中西音樂文學都有過很深的研究的。確具着藝術的天才可惜個性高傲。寄情山水。不爲世用。使他就此埋没。　恨而終。中國的曼殊。歐西的拜倫。都是早亡。他還有兩分相似悲哉。</p>
<p>關於音樂。他曾自譜有「满城風雨」一曲。其中含着悲凉慷慨的韻調。急風暴雨的聲音。現在也隨着他而消逝了。對於文學並没有巨作。僅有兩集新詩。就是「幽蘭姑娘」和「纖雲」。去年第二次在黃山養病。曾寫了七言雜詩十首。哀感頑艷。悽絶動人。曾刋載於旅行雜誌裏。可憐連他到死還不知道發表呢。餘文有一時期散見在報章雜誌裏。後來一心學佛。就不做文章了。他一生奇特的生活。很有文學的意味。記者知之頗詳。預備將來替他出一本專集。還望讀者賜給我一些關於他的材料呢。編辭源的陸爾逵老先生。大同樂會的鄭覲文先生。戲劇家歐陽予倩君。都是他的相識。得到了這　耗。不知感想如何。</p>
<h3>琥珀語出郭贊</h3>
<p>— 陶在東</p>
<p>九三老人宣布曹仲淵君函。見十九日本刋。函述英人所著無綫電之先導一書中。引晋郭璞琥珀拾芥語。曹君探討郭語出自何書。多年未獲。凡物理電化科學萌芽。往往見諸中華古籍。但絶少發明。求得語源。亦殊無謂。然如琥珀拾芥。磁石引鐵之語。唐宋後文集中習見之。乃英人不引。而必引晋之郭璞。可謂從朔討源者矣。外人能引之。而吾國人反不知其出處。豈不可恥。曹君窮年蒐討。其精勤可佩。吾人有一知半解。自應抒寫以爲之助。愚按此乃郭璞山海經圖贊句也。查淵鑑類函珍寳部增引郭璞贊云。磁石吸鐵。琥珀取芥。象有潛通。數亦冥會。物之相感。出乎意外等語。又查郭璞著作最顯者。除注爾雅外。惟山海經注圖贊。今淵鑑類函旣增引郭贊以意例求之。其爲山海經圖贊也無疑。惟國贊原書已佚。後人有無輯本。則淺見未知。淵鑑類函所引。亦引自唐宋以來諸類書所先引者耳。至郭贊之外。愚記得抱朴子確有磁石引針琥珀取芥之句。又琥珀燈蕊。摩擦療風。語出本草註。抑千金方。則記憶不眞。客中無書。不能檢證。要之葛洪陶宏景孫邈均晋人。可見此兩事。爲晋代所習知。而成爲當時之普通流行語耳。九三老人所引王弼易乾赴註。見廿一本刋。王弼恰漢晋間人。語源自漢。理固有之。</p>
<h3>我所望於母親</h3>
<p>— 閒人</p>
<p>母親，你生產了話多創造偉大事業的男子，但你爲甚又生產許多社會　瘤的女子？這樣未免太不公平。</p>
<p>不管男子或女子，同都脫胎於母懷，也應享受父母相同的敎養，和社會平等的待遇，如此才能共同擔負起家庭的責任與社會事業的義務。</p>
<p>社會是人類的結體，而人類是男女兩性。的組合要支撑這社會將要崩潰的危局，便須使社會的基石鞏固。</p>
<p>母親，你是最先負有敎育兒童使命的人，要如何敎育兒童們剷除軟囚女子，欲操支配權的野心。更應該怎樣喚起女兒們的自覺；要以依賴爲羞辱，自已要爲自已的一生勞動。</p>
<p>母親！希望你敎育你的兒女們努力創造人類光明的史蹟，並敎他們以勞動剩餘的價値用去帮助社會上老糼病苦的人們！</p>
<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>錫蘭島可郎波colomboceylon地方的監獄中。有三個兇悍的罪犯。性烈如火力大如牛。品行異常惡劣。獄官無法管敎。便監禁在特别堅固的獄室中。誰知那鐵窗四面的磚塊。却已被白蟻日積月累當東西吃。一推便鬆。竟便宜了這三個罪犯。潛逃無踪。</p>
<p>美國有一位敎育專家。曾作一種有趣味的試騐。將他自已的生才十月的兒子。和一頭出世兩個月黑猩猩。受同樣敎練。經過了種種的試騐法。據他說。那猩猩竟比孩子聰明。而容易敎練得多。孩子的優勝之點。只在學習說話。其他都不及猩猩。</p>
<p>英國不列顚博物院britishmuseum的圖書館中。每年前去閱書的人。計有一百二十餘萬人。書架長六十英里。陳書四百萬卷。可謂洋洋大觀。</p>
<h3>京杭道的巡禮（下）</h3>
<p>— 跚跚</p>
<p>（五）湖州剪影　　從車上看湖州，湖州是一個恬靜的地方，並且是恬靜得令人安逸的樂土，｜雖然事實上並不盡然。</p>
<p>密一陣疏一陣的電桿當中，偶或夾雜一兩支烟囱，囱口胃着黑蛇似的長烟。城牆是矮小的，建築是撲質的，一眼望去都是黑壓壓的屋背，其間没有紅屋，也没有層樓。小橋邊，開着一片小小的茶店，橋下遊過一支小小的烏蓬船，四圍數里間無山，天空與地面是同一地廣闊無涯際，田野裏，巷梢端，人影並不多見，空氣是温馴而和平的。</p>
<p>年邁的婦人，提着竹籃，走到車窗口，仰着劃满了紋縐的頭，顫聲地呌呌「五香茶葉蛋。」　　（六）沉着的山</p>
<p>李家巷的前面有一座山，不是山，我應該說他是一個碩大無比的石塊，這石塊的顏色是蒼老的綠與幽默的褐，石塊的頂尖是菱形的起伏，在羣山當中，這是最最雄健而沉着的，有着北國山嶺的氣質，山石是明潔的，有很多工人在山側而開採石頭，在鐵與石碰擊的鏗鏘聲中，我們會味出工人們的汗來。</p>
<p>（七）長興換車</p>
<p>因爲過了長興便是江蘇的境地，浙江省公路局的汽車到長興便停止了，那時如果還要往前，非得要換車不可。車是江南汽車公司的車，車輛比到省公路局的新，並且也似乎寛大了，當我上去的時，人已坐得满满，没有辦法，祗得坐在一個胖婦人的邊邊兒上，很不舒服。　　（八）太湖邊上</p>
<p>敲過十一點鐘，車從長興開出，不上多少路，就到了太湖的邊緣，車道沿着山脚蜿蜒着，山是巍峩的層山，巨掌似的掩去了半個天空，而太湖裏的水呢；我眞不知怎麽說才能比喻他的浩大，在蒼茫的水氣裏浮動着機扇帆，水的盡頭和天空是銜接着，和這掌掩去半個天空的層山正做了個極明顯的對比，我恍如走上了海洋與大陸當間的界線，眼睛很忙，不斷的左右顧盼。</p>
<p>（九）黑的烟柱</p>
<p>車過夾浦，已經到了江蘇宜興的境界，宜興的鄉間是出產陶器的，鄉人在小山上製窑，每天都在燒着，黑的烟柱從山尖上胃起，愈胃愈大，這將比之於炊烟吧，似乎炊烟没有他那樣可怕，比之於火山噴發時的漿，那這烟柱却又欠點兒勁了。</p>
<p>（十）脫逃的牛</p>
<p>自從入了宜興界内，車道從黃沙覆面的一變而爲石子路，而水汀橋樑也就變了木質的，縱然車輛比到浙江的新，可是路兒不平，顚　得怪厲害，乘客們被劇烈地　動，好像呼吸的力氣都被剝奪了。</p>
<p>當地人，說這顚　的汽車是一隻脫逃的牛，而乘客呢；却變了被人抛動的西瓜了。</p>
<h3>戎馬雙棲記（九○）</h3>
<p>— 求幸福齋主人</p>
<p>第十一回　偏估小邑瞻仰牙旌　猥瑣羣流呵從騶</p>
<p>他老人家旣親身領導這兩位貴官前來。也當然只有陪伴到長興大旅館他那最熱悉的好地方去。以便盡心盡禮備辦一個周到妥貼的招待。果然。一行列馳聘到長興大旅館的大門口。就此打住。鄔四爺頭一個翻身下馬。便喜笑洋洋的大踏步逕往大門裏面闖。一迭連聲的高喊着秦掌櫃秦掌櫃。快出來接客人。幸而那满身土老氣的秦掌櫃。早已得着了信。怱怱忙忙的打開錢櫃。抓出一件摺疊好的秦西青羽毛緞的對襟馬褂。抖開來套在他那舊毛藍大布的夾袍上。有兩三粒鈕子都還未扣齊。就跟蹌着奔出來。與鄔四爺在大門裏賬房櫃檯邊迎頭碰個正着。鄔四爺來不及慢條斯理的多說話。拉着秦掌櫃的手仍跑出大門外。指着一輛剛停住的騾車說道。我陪了省裏兩位貴客來啦。且先與你引見引見。并歡迎貴客下車罷。恰好這時頭一輛騾車中。已有一位貴客。由一個馬弁攙扶了下來。秦掌櫃戰戰兢兢的抬頭一望。見這位貴客竟還是個很漂亮的少年軍官。穿一套嶄新的黃呢子軍服。通體現出好幾條很頓齊的摺疊的痕跡。兩肩上掛着一對用赤金小絲兒織成的牌子。周圍鑲着一分來寛的長方形的金邊框。當中各嵌一粒蠶豆般大的五角金星。金煌煌耀得人眼珠發眩。又在那一邁腿之下。另發見他的一雙新光燦亮長統黃皮靴的脚後跟邊。還配上個金製的馬刺輪。縱然脚碰脚　的一聲踏在那香爐似的街道上灰堆裏。仍埋没不了那金色輝芒的閃爍。不由把這個慣做買賣人的秦掌櫃。從認識黃金貴重價値的法眼裏。驀地引起莫名的驚訝。只暗想着這位大貴人簡直視黃金如糞土。是我這土老兒破天荒頭一次開眼所僅見。就昏眩得失神失智。口角流涎。呆呆的祗立在一旁發楞了。多虧鄔四爺在耳邊將他悠悠喚醒。是那麽高聲引見着道。來來來。先見過我們的安司令。</p>

<p>揭價多抑六兩　揭價仍爲八百二十兩、因美金未更、計撳六十六兩至七十兩、後六十七兩結果六十九兩、較前天多撳六兩、洵以金價做小也、登賬七月五十六兩、八月五十一兩、縮水五十六兩、</p>

<h3>外匯由平轉鬆</h3>
<p>昨日銀市均又見縮、匯兌略小、本埠市况突見回風、滙豐掛牌除法郎縮一元、香港加一二五外、餘均勿動、惟内部晨平後鬆、以此金價呈反動之勢、狀態迷惑、迨午收比較前天、計英金扯平、美金長二五、華商交易不及上日之盛、計英金約共十萬鎊、金業中扒遠出近、孟買電購十月份、而美金約有五六十萬元、大半扒進抵空、間有套出金子、結價比昨日多撳六兩光景、計七十兩左右、銀行方而匯豐依然賣出、下午因逢週六無市、今將所成交者錄后、</p>

<h3>週末釐拆續滯</h3>
<p>市塲槪况　昨日銀洋市面、以銀行下午因星期六之例有假時、故各種收解消息、異常冷靜、即市塲中洋欵買賣亦屬寥落、遂致市價於午間均無上落矣、</p>
<p>釐拆價格　「洋釐」早市爲六錢九分零八毫七忽半、午市爲六錢九分零六毫二忽半、結果較前日午市續小八毫七忽半、「銀拆」早午兩市皆開一錢一分、較前日小去一分、銀行掛牌四分、劃頭加水二三錢、</p>
<p>銀洋進出　「銀欵」銀欵收解、銀行方面有限、華商收解票欵一百六七十萬、外商收解票欵一百二三十萬、各種貨匯稅計諸欵收解五百六七十萬、進倉三十萬、出倉四十萬、錢莊銀公單收解二千二百餘萬劃頭欵收解一百五十餘萬各路匯欵收解七十餘萬、解現二三十萬、「洋欵」滙劃票欵、早市做出五十七萬午市做出四十五萬五千、鈔票早市五萬五千、午市五萬、塲外鈔票、祇早市九萬四千、銀行買賣、早市五十萬、午市四十萬洋户往來收解一百十餘萬、鈔票進出一百三十餘萬、錢莊洋公單收解四百七十餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解一百五十餘萬、拆借洋欵進出一百六十餘萬、小錢莊交易四十餘萬、</p>

<h3>紗花紗市多變趨好面</h3>
<p>棉紗市况轉佳、形勢極其紊亂、一日三變、使人殊難捉摸、實缘跌日太久、由一百五十六兩之價、直瀉至三十九兩進開、而榮興號獨購兩日、由空翻多、包額甚巨、晨間以美棉賒於吾國已有眉目、市塲人心大起恐慌、驟跌二兩外、敲破四十兩一時賣氣大熾、後有大户收買、遂見回漲、出四十兩關外、午後形勢依然緊張、目前市面陷在怒濤駭浪中、變化迅速、但實需仍屬滯鈍、總之經濟不振、紗銷大受打擊、探之多數心理、對於標紗、觀其回見一百四十五兩左右云、</p>
<p>人標時現變化　人標前市開盤、以美棉平平、而市塲上以美棉賒買之事、有定局希望、致人心惶恐、賣户大增、各月跌二兩、收盤回漲、結果各月漲五·六·九錢、午後開盤聞某國紗跌三·四元、形勢稍疲、二三盤又漲、各月又漲四·八·錢、全日成交統計四萬零八百包、查賣出同餘一千一百包、義成一千包、泰昌九百包、同和八百包、益昶八百包、義餘八百包、買進榮興四千一百五十包、賡豐一千一百包、明德九百五十包、天隆八百五十包、仁豐六百包、兹將收盤價分列如下、</p>

<p>現需薄弱如故　現紗銷路仍滯、查全日各帮買去統計六百五十包、同行中進四十包、行情跌五錢至七錢半、客帮雲南進三百三十六包、廣東進一百八十五包、四川進五十包、長沙進三十包内地進二十一包云、</p>
<h3>棉市平庸</h3>
<p>棉市始跌後漲、形勢尙平、但美棉六十萬包賒於吾國之事、已有相當成就之說、由此散多人心大起恐怖、七八兩月猛跌七·八錢、但榮興乘跌時購進、二盤現紗趨漲、回力尤强、遂漲五六錢、但多數心理認爲目前無甚影響、本棉現貨尙缺、七月份交割恐無充量之籌碼、做多者仍湧、且有一部份看其回漲至三十兩、總之各廠外棉吸飽、目下無甚需要、如無特殊變象、上漲之力較鮮、但查市塲上情形、多數因其價低、買進者較衆、然迥顧美棉價格愈廉也、</p>
<p>鄭標軟後見回　鄭標前市開盤、以美棉平平、開盤跌六·七錢、至三盤回漲、各月跌五分、午後又跌一錢五分至二錢、全日成交統計九萬四千七百担、查賣出　隆三千六百担、吉豐一千三百担、長和五千二百担、同興二千七百担、同餘二千一百担、長豐一千八百担、買進榮興三千四百担、信誠四千二百担、益豐四千七百担、恒德二千五百擔、兹將收盤價分列如下、鄭標收盤　漲跌　存賬數十月二八三０跌二五　一四九、三００七月二七八０跌一０　五八、六００十一月二八六五二五一五一六００八月二八一五　一五一０四、一００總計　四六九、六００</p>
<p>棉需全寂　現棉生意完全停頓、各廠一無辦胃云、</p>
<h3>美棉依然不振</h3>
<p>昨日美棉初因利物浦消息良好而堅、後因華爾街不振及天氣益佳而疲、計期貨跌三至五磅音、現貨不動、英棉期貨漲二三點、現貨漲三點、埃及棉現貨漲十點、印棉成交不多、售價平覆、計平果爾漲○·二五羅比、奥辣姆未動、白羅溪漲○·七五羅比、原電錄左、（二十四日電）</p>

<h3>上週美棉因蟲患而堅穏</h3>
<p>東部棉作良好西部不佳　　紐約六月二十四日電告一週棉市狀况云、本週原棉市場中、由新近低紀錄而起漲風、後市價起落頗形參差、而同時交易亦覺沉寂、棉帶東部陣雨時作、愈增果　蟲患之虞、此種惶慮、雖未引起强烈之買氣、但已限制賣風、南方現無出賣之壓力、故售出無多、連日東部氣候晴朗而熱、已稍稍引起較多之出售、七月份期貨了結亦屬不少、爲同業購人及缺方於價落時補進所吸收、棉帶西部有棉作進行良好之報告、據若干人意見、東部雨水過多、又有棉葉多液與棉田多草之說加以棉帶南部三分之二、自魯西亞那州起以東各處復有果　蟲、蔓延增加之報告、故西部棉作良好之說、將爲上述消息所抵銷、有數方面以爲果　蟲之蔓延、甚爲嚴重、爲一九二三年以後所未有、附錄週末統計如左、（單位千包）　　　　　　　一九三一年　一九三二年本季上市累計　一二、九八七　一四、四七一八月一日起廠用累計　四、六一二　四、七四五　　　又出口累計　　六、五九九　八、三四一　　　至日本　一、一五七　二、二三四　　　至中國　五五三　一、０三四　　　至英國　一、０七五　一、二七二　　　至德國　一、六七二　一、五五四紐約存貨　　　二二八　二０四各港鎭存貨　　五、九七七　五、０五一全世界供給　　八、二０九　九一一八其中美棉　　　五、八一八　七、一六０八月一日起全世界　一０二四一　一二、０五一美棉提用</p>

<h3>糧食河下米市又跌二角</h3>
<p>滬南　昨日各帮來船約十餘號、浦存不多、城鄉店胃究緣門銷不暢、兼之天宮漸暖、棧存難以久擱、厚粳行情又修角外、　稻貨色稀少、　　舗需要尙殷、開盤定局、早稻零碎走動數十石、價軟一角、</p>
<p>滬北　昨日來船十念號、本街交易有限、北粳新鮮平穏、中開縮短二角、早晚稻無榮辱、洋埠秈貨雖零星但胃口擯塞、洋米到銷二淡、市價續修、變陰元貨雖缺少、市居平定、</p>
<h3>洋米跌勢益狂</h3>
<p>昨日新到西貢五萬包</p>
<p>江北帮需要甚殷</p>
<p>昨日洋米市况、又見變化、小絞中次米跌小角許、西貢一號較前日小去角半、但比之前日售開之價、乃小有二三角之鉅、因目下存旣足、昨日又新到西貢一船、有五萬餘包、由元利裝到、西貢一號售開中關米五百五十包、價乃跌進十一元大關、祗爲十元零八角半、小絞開二千五百包、價九元六角半至九元三角半、又温州白米二百五十包、價九元二角半、温州糧米五百六十包、價八元四角三四分至八元四角、小絞米由鎭江江北兩户辦去二千包外、其餘統爲本街收進、又訊江北各區自遭去年大水災後、米糧早感不足、需要上頗爲殷切、昨日南市行家領到護照一萬包、昨日已初次試辦數百包云、</p>
<h3>標粉午後又轉呆滯</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、略呈穏俏之象、因洋麥雖報小一二角左右、惟津帮方面、現粉銷塲、已經漸活、昨又成交五萬包、直裝天津、仍申元一兩九錢三分、所以外行心思、頗形挺住、交易亦尙暢旺、迨至下午開盤、客銷難動、祇有零星、兼之廠家、陸續出檔、故市氣又轉呆木、觀察後步、如津銷起色此種市面、或可站住也、結果七八九月份各較小二厘半、餘未動云</p>
<h3>期麥轉向堅勢</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各月份市面、已轉堅穏之狀、以洋麥雖續小一二角、惟以廠家方面、對子現麥、目下漸有胃口、市上之高貨、逐有收進、而一般扳户、以時局關係、深恐交通不便、裝運爲難、故抛售心思、未免轉懈、有此原因、市氣遂呈好象、不過漲度過疾、亦難免再受打擊、因洋麥一經合算、須防套頭之壓迫也、結果七月份較前日大五分、八月份大四分、九月份大二分、十十一月份大三分、現麥市况、頗見活絡、開太倉麥二兩八錢八分、白鶴港麥二兩八錢二分、蓬萊麥二兩九錢二三分、吳淞麥二兩七錢七分、黃渡麥二兩七錢七分、共計一千二百包云</p>
<h3>絲茶白廠經綢銷不寂</h3>
<p>内地綢廠、近因秋綢銷路漸暢、原料需要日增、而今歲土絲產歉質劣、中身白廠經因洋莊銷路呆滯、價已跌至最低限度、扯合綢本尙爲合算、綢門分起抛購、絲銷頗不寂寞、惜成交不旺、昨由美亞雲章物華等進Ｂ級頂頭號二十至二十二條份現貨滬白廠經各五包至十包、價扯五百二十五兩、</p>
<h3>祁花香繼續開盤</h3>
<p>昨日祁門花香紅茶、已由俄國協助會洋行開盤、新價開出十五兩、較去年見低七兩、貢熙綠茶、自俄莊開辦後、白頭莊　義裕隆富林等行均起動辦、交易尙不寂寞、婺東屯溪歙縣遂安等路之珍眉珠茶、交易亦視前略爲見旺、人心堅定、市面似無劇烈變動、據一般茶商觀察、現下紅綠茶價、均已跌至極低廉地位茶銷頗有發展之可能性、</p>
<h3>五金五金市象清靜</h3>
<p>五金交易、近來異常清靜、蓋客帮方面、均無需胃、而廠家點綴亦屬有限、是以市勢頗感寂寞、而各貨趨勢在此平淡無奇之局面、亦少榮辱、雖昨日平白鐵、白鐵瓦等俱有開出惟行情一節、殊鮮上落、馬口鐵則　價雖屬高昂、但實際開出依然如故、惟青鉛昨日受定價下降之影響、内盤市價較爲便宜、但大數標準、尙無開出、而零估現市仍開十二兩五錢云、</p>
<h3>南北貨新海口枝正批已到</h3>
<p>開價普通約十兩上下新海口枝、正批貨已於前日由慶元輸運到、兹查共計一百十餘箱、貨品普通爲多、昨號行雙方正在協定價格、及六時許猶未成盤、大約較高者十一二兩、普通莊其勢恐不上十兩、後批數較多、亦已告抵、今明日可以續開、如需要暢逹、此價或可暫定也、</p>

<p>勞方表示　藥業職業工會常務理事、昨對新聲社記者云、各資方破壞勞資條件、拒絶外塲替工者、有馮存仁堂等、現工會决根據議决、第一步警告資方、如不覺悟、則令該店單獨罷工、如不逹到勝利、則全市職工、一致起來援助、至將罷工時、决再開聯席會議决定、同時並呈報黨政機關援助、現各資方態度强硬、故罷工恐成事實、但我們以藥業罷工、有關地方治安、影響人民甚大、希望各資方趕快覺悟云、</p>

<h3>盗匪與事主均爲謀殺案中要犯</h3>
<p>捕房已經過詳細調查</p>
<p>出事處表演謀殺情形</p>
<p>各被告昨均堅决否認</p>
<p>推事主張再詳細調查</p>
<p>庽居威海衛路永吉里七百四十六號門牌之皖人孔廣福、於本月十六號晚八時、投新閘捕房報告、謂頃聞伊家被盗侵入刦去五百八十元之財物、惟内有兩盗、伊素來相識、名周仲義、周仲華·弟兄二人云云、捕房得報、乃飭華探長湯堅、探目花友山·西探員可英·等往勞勃生路大旭里三九二三號、將兩周逮捕、但周氏昆仲、對于盗案、矢口否認、且供明孔有</p>
<p>謀害王阿寳　情事、未幾、有孔之友張國民赴捕房探望、亦被周等指爲孔之同黨、捕頭諭將孔·張·及兩周并予收押、十八日晨、解送第一特區法院、捕房對兩周以强盗罪起訴、惟孔張兩人之殺人案、捕房因未調查、故請求准予覊押、庭諭孔張准予覊押、兩周押候改期再訊各情、已誌本報、兹經承辦此案之中西探員、於改期中經過</p>
<p>詳細之調查　始悉孔張及兩周均爲謀殺案中要犯、孔擔任總指揮、張副之、兩周爲帮助犯、緣民國十八年間、以上四被告均充任市黨部幹事、而兩周兼任滬西勞勃生路日商東亞株式會社繭袋廠爲工頭、其時工潮澎　、各廠發生罷工風潮、孔等</p>
<p>曾組織工會　暗中指揮、遂派周仲義（綽號小滑頭）·周仲義（綽號大滑頭）·至勞勃生路南福里二二五二號門牌王阿寳（即謝阿寳）家勸王加入工會（王亦在繭袋廠爲工頭）、煽惑工人罷工、因王未允、乃由會中出賞格一千元、謀害王阿寳、至十八年十二月十二號上午五時半、王果於庽所附近南福里弄内</p>
<p>被開槍擊斃　倒臥於自來水籠頭旁邊、事後孔得賞洋二百元、張得八十元、兩周各得四十元、自王被殺後、當時該管普陀路捕房頗爲注意、派探密查、以兩周有謀害嫌疑、故曾將拘入捕房、惟因調查結果、證據不足、乃將釋放、此次經捕房重加偵查、以四被告實有謀殺主阿寳之嫌疑、</p>
<p>且不僅此案　尙犯謀殺譚宜生董其桂·石金桂·等數案、以故命各被告書就供單、并於日前先命孔廣褐帶同探員、至出事地點、表演當時謀害情形、及死者倒臥處所後、又帶同其餘三被告前往表演、均與出事時捕房所</p>
<p>調查之情形　相符、昨晨八時半、捕房將四被告押解特院刑二庭、即據捕房律師王耀堂詳述以上情形并稱現對四被告以刑法二八四條第一欵殺人罪起訴、控其於民國十八年十二月十二日早五時半、在勞勃生路南福里槍殺謝阿寳（即王阿寳）一名、對于</p>
<p>其餘謀殺案　捕房因尙未調查終結、故暫不起訴、遂將供單呈案請究、詰之被告等、同延范剛·李時蕊·朱鴻烈·三律師到庭代辯、繼據被害人謝阿寳之母謝王氏及姊孫謝氏相繼投案、證明一切、詰之被告周仲義供稱、我對于王阿寳被害事、完全不知、實因孔廣福誣我爲盗、故我</p>
<p>亦誣其殺人　其實王阿寳係被共產黨所害、彼時我在市黨部爲幹事、并未干預、即使王有不法之事、儘可報告司法機關、或社會局懲辦、與我無涉、且王爲我同廠好友、與其姊母等向來相識、决不能</p>
<p>作犯法之事　應請明察、周仲華供、我并未至王家囑其加入工會、及唆使罷工情事、實因孔向捕房誣告、故我亦誣彼殺人、所有四十元、亦非分得之賞洋實係向孔告借、孔廣福供、民國十六年至十八年、余在市黨部爲幹事、承審推事吳廷琪當詢其死者、王阿寳在蔴袋廠爲工頭、因爾呌其罷工未遂、故將其打死、尙有賞格一千元、</p>
<p>爾得二百元　張國民得八十元、兩周各得四十元、此事有嗎、孔答没有、此事因去年余與周仲華索欠口角、發生打架、同至司令部、故積有仇隙、今被誣攀、捕房内之供單、亦係不得已而胡供、張國民供亦在市黨部爲幹事、否認擔任副指揮及謀殺王阿寳、經吳推事核供、以本</p>
<p>案尙有展期調查之必要、乃諭四被告還押、候改期七月二號上午再訊、</p>

<h3>雨中憑弔吳淞</h3>

<p>余服務於吳淞海岸無線電台，自一二八脫險後、逗留租界、已逾四月。日昨，偕友憑弔吳淞，適値梅雨瀟瀟，凄凉满目，而向日直入雲霄之無線電台，已被炸燬，追尋戰績，不無有感；爰書四絶，以饗讀者烽火無端戰禍開，園林焦土有餘哀，瀟瀟梅雨吳淞路，不見巍峨一電台。曲徑荒蕪景色昏，斷垣殘壁總銷魂，依稀舊地誠難辨，處處惟留子彈痕。沙場陣地忍追尋，殺敵三軍戰有神，十萬倭奴齊膽落，英名偉績著千春。前來憑弔百愁生，淚满青衫不忍行，留得幾枝悴憔柳，雨中如訴别離情。</p>

<h3>水的清潔法</h3>
<p>— 允釐</p>
<p>水的清潔與否，對於人們的生活，是很有關係的。普通的水，大都含有不乾凈的雜質在裏面；若不設法使之清潔，便拿來充作飲料水，這是很不合衛生，於生命很有危險的。所以我們要想吃乾凈的水，必須要經過下面四種方法中之一種手續，然後才有潔凈的水可飲。</p>
<p>（一）膠結法（coogulationtreatment)：把明礬研成細粉，放入污水中，攪匀溶化後，便生一種膠狀物和水中的泥砂，微生物及一切不乾凈的雜質粘合起來，沉澱到水底，二三小時後，水便清潔，可以用作飲料了。這種方法很簡便，大約只要一兩個銅元，便可以成功。没有自來水的家庭裏的飲料水，多可採用這種方法。但是明礬味澀，分量不可用得太多！</p>
<p>（二）過濾法（filtration）：用個底下有孔的瓦缸或是花盆，孔中塞一塊海棉。然後在底上舗一寸多厚炭屑，炭屑上舗一寸多厚石礫，石礫上舗一寸多厚細砂；這樣的舗至多層，這個濾水器便算成功了。再把污水倒入缸中，不一會，便有乾凈水從缸底孔中流出來。但是，這個濾水器内的炭屑，細砂，石礫等，也要時常掉換或設法洗滌，以免不乾凈的物質和微生物留存在裏面。</p>
<p>（三）煑沸法（Boiling）：把水放在鍋中，煑到十五分鐘的時間，或是温度逹到攝氏寒暑表九十度以上的時候，水便沸了；水中的微生物，便不能生活了。若拿這種水來做飲料水，就没有致人疾病的危險。所以家庭間要想减少疾病，對於飲料水，必得要實行這種方法。</p>
<p>以上一，二兩種方法，只能除去水中的泥砂雜質，而不能殺滅水中的微生物。第三種方法只能消滅微生物，而不能除去泥砂。若一，三兩種方法並用，或二，三兩種方法合用，來製日常的飲料水，是很合用的。但是，溶在水中的雜質，又不能完全除去，這確是共同的缺點。要想免去這種缺點，吃純潔的乾凈水，必須要用蒸餾法。</p>
<p>（四）蒸餾法（Distillat）：用個玻璃瓶，中間放五分之三的水，瓶口塞一軟木塞，軟木塞的中間挿一端較長一端較短的一根彎曲玻璃管。次把短管的一端挿在瓶中，但要注意，不可挿入水底。把較長的一端，伸出瓶外。再次把較長的一端玻璃管上，套上一個竹筒，這竹筒裏使冷水流迪不息。再在這長玻管的下面放一個面盆，然後用火在玻璃瓶下面燒。等到瓶内的水燒沸時，蒸氣便從玻璃管中流出，遇着竹筒中的冷，便化成水從管中流倒面盆中。這種水就是蒸餾水。但竹筒裏冷水，要時常更換，以防變熱，因爲變熱，便不能使蒸氣凝結成水。這蒸餾水是很衛生的，現在醫院裏，和調製化學的藥品都是應用這種水。</p>

<h3>國文課的末日</h3>
<p>— 卓君</p>
<p>自廢除科舉以後，由私熟變爲學校，學術界得以自由研究，不因八股之毒而限制人之智識慾，此乃我國敎育之一大解放。</p>
<p>不過在下所要講的，就是滬上某大學上國文課的印象與同學們的心理。</p>
<p>上課鐘是敲了，在敎室裏的許多同學都豎着脖子向敎室的門口膽望，期待這位國文敎授快一點來，因爲是開課後的第一次國文課。至於這敎授姓什麽，有很多都不知道，所以大衆都爲着要瞻仰這敎授的丰采，今天到得很齊，差不多有人满之患，因爲敎室外面有幾位同學來得遲些，以致向隅，只好鵠立在敎室外面的窗子下。</p>
<p>「弗曉得格位先生姓啥？」綽號大塊頭的同學問他旁邊坐着的王君。</p>
<p>「聽說是姓汪吧！」王君不能肯定的答覆他。</p>
<p>没有多久，頭髮很長的國文敎授跨入了敎室裏，面上帶着笑容地向同學們說：「諸位的上課證請拿來簽字吧！」他說完這話之後，同學們一窩蜂的跑向前去爭着要這敎授簽字，但是敎授也没有辦法，只好說：「慢慢交呀，總歸來得及。」</p>
<p>「哼，格位先生倒弗見得凶咧！」大塊頭對着同學們這樣說。</p>
<p>「以後我們不上課也不要緊。」陳君似乎回答大塊頭的語氣。</p>
<p>果然，一星期是過去了。每逢上國文課的時候，敎室裏總是冷落得很，除了幾十個老實一點的同學在座外，其餘的都不願上這國文課他們情願在寢室裏睡睡覺，或談談天。</p>
<p>在三十八號的寢室裏，大塊頭的同學的嗓子傳佈到隔壁的王君寢室裏來了，下面是大塊頭同學的議論：「我爲啥要讀伊（國文）呢，不過爲此格幾個學分咧；倘使没有格幾個學分，我眞格弗高興讀伊；我呢大學生眞格用弗着讀國文哉：並且我又是讀銀行系，更弗消讀哉。：」</p>
<p>｜此篇内容，係我摯友王君與我談話中無意談起來，在下覺得有公佈的必要，使讀者諸君明白現在大學裏的國文課是徒有其名而無其實，所謂牠的末日到了，不知老學究們讀此後將發生何種感想，抑將謂之「斯文喪盡」也歟！</p>

<h3>看了「有電話者注意」的感想</h3>
<p>— 怡怡館主</p>
<p>前天，（廿二日）本報的本埠新聞欄内，載有一則新奇的新聞，它的標題，是「有電話者注意」，說是｜</p>
<p>「最近有年在二十八與三十間之華人一，高五英尺七寸左右，中等身材，面微黑而圓，雙目特大且圓，短髮，衣藍布短襖褲，頭戴方格鴨舌帽，能說流利英語，專往各住家，或營業機關，騙取電話：：」</p>
<p>我看了以上這段新聞，於是發生了以下的感想：</p>
<p>我覺得年來社會上失業者，有增無减，一方面學校畢業生，以及歸國的留學生，源源不絶，而一方面則百業凋敝，生產落後，凡般事業，停滯不前，這一批批的學校畢業生，以及歸國的留學生，固然没有這許多延攬的去處，自然，這如許失業者，更不容易得到安挿之塲所，於是强者走險，弱者悲觀，或異想天開，做那種種欺騙的勾留，如那位專騙取人家電話的騙子，難免不是其中之一吧？他的裝扮，雖像一個工人模樣，但旣能說流利英語，我們料想他雖不是一位歸國的留學生，然亦當是一位什麽學校的畢業生，我以爲這種騙子，不僅是有電話者當注意，就是在社會上舉足輕重的先生們，也應該加以注意啊。</p>

<h3>把風</h3>
<p>— 譚卓明</p>
<p>這是ＸＸ公司的堆貨棧！一所三層的「滬式房子，二樓和樓下堆着貨，三樓給職員們做宿舍，樓下的灶間，劃出來給棧房管理員Ｌ做辦公室也算住所，室内祗有一隻方桌和一隻板床，陳設是很簡陋，因爲壁上褂着自來水管的原故，地下很潮濕，加之满地舗着濃痰，所以濕而帶膠了，是黃昏的時候，室内五六個人分佈在板床上和桌子邊，有幾個人吸着香烟，一縷縷的白烟從各人的口中噴出，這室内便蒙了一重很厚的白霧。</p>
<p>「出去白相不」？Ｌ見他們這幾天没有出去奇怪地問。</p>
<p>「唔！有什麽地方好去呢，安樂窩是歇業，利源公司是關門，大世界一帶寂寞的和死一樣，誰還高興出去」，Ｂ長長的嘆一口氣。</p>
<p>「我們自已來吧，牌九，撲克，隨便那一種也好」，撲克健將Ｔ乘機提議。</p>
<p>「不，太危險，給老板看見怎麽樣？大家都不好，」Ｌ因爲要負這裏的安全責任所以「竭力反對，」</p>
<p>「找一個人把風，」</p>
<p>呆子，隔着兩層樓用什麽法子傳遞消息？」</p>
<p>「唔：：：」</p>
<p>大家覺得没有法子「把風」，面上現着失望的顏色，默然不語，室内沉寂着。</p>
<p>Ｋ是這公司裏的賬房先生，人很機警，多智，老板很信任他，好飲酒，但不大肯自已拿錢來買，同事們有什麽事請他解决，祗須請他一頓飲食，他便欣然帮忙，久而久之，便成了一種貿易事業，現在，他見機會來了，縐着眉，搔着髮，找他一頓飲的代價，好一會，微微的笑着說：</p>
<p>「你們能請我飲一頓，我便給你一一個很好的「把風法子，」</p>
<p>各人的視綫一齊集中在Ｋ的面上，Ｋ微笑不言，Ｔ知道這是他的老脾氣，伸手在衣袋裏摸出兩隻大洋，「乓」！一聲放在桌子上。</p>
<p>「說出來，能夠適用，以此爲壽」，</p>
<p>「這法子很容易，我明天去對老板說：「宿舍裏的人太懶，睡覺時每每忘了熄電燈，最好把電表裝在Ｌ的房子裏，呌Ｌ每晚負責開關，我想老板一定肯答應，事情便成功了，老板來的時候，祇須把電表旋幾旋，樓上的電燈不是一光一暗嗎？」</p>
<p>「好妙計，去，大家去飲一大杯」，Ｔ拿着桌子上的兩隻大洋首先走，大家歡呼着跟在後面擁出室外。</p>
<p>自此以後老板常常對人讚奬他的職員說：</p>
<p>「我每次到宿舍監察，全體職員都在讀書或寫字。」</p>

<h3>中國人的新發明</h3>
<p>— 俞劍華</p>
<p>中國人自古以來不知發明了多少好東西。到現在發明的能力更發逹了，尤其是我們的政府當局，差不多天天在那兒挖空心思，翻新花樣，眞無愧是東方的愛迪生呢。</p>
<p>去年　了我們那少帥發明了一個「不抵抗」，便輕輕的把個東三省送掉了，今年又被老同志發明了個「長期抵抗」，於是又幾乎輕輕的把淞滬送掉。</p>
<p>在滬變初起初時候，發明了個「不失寸土」後未又因爲不大夠用，便又發明了個「變　戰略，退第二防線」。我們的「民族之光」最初發明了個「誓守國土」，後來又發明了個「退保實力」，又發明了個「虚與委蛇」，又發明了個「誓死力爭」，現在恐怕又在發明「收集反攻」了。</p>
<p>政府在裁厘以後，便接着發明了「營業稅」，現在又因爲收不到東三省和兩廣的國稅，聰明的娘舅不日就要發明出甚麽苛捐雜稅以外的「新稅」了。</p>
<p>在已經禁烟以後，就發明了個「寓禁於徵」，現在又發明了個「公賣」。Ｘ租界剛要禁烟，已有人發明包辦搶捐的「保安公司」了。</p>
<p>像發明家這樣多，發明家這樣妙，不到幾年，中國何愁不變成一等强國呢？</p>

<h3>一椿慘無人道的暴行</h3>
<p>— 士本</p>
<p>上月本刋樂山君的（一個婢女的自述）一文，已將世間婢女的痛苦，盡情洩露，但是現在有一椿更有甚於其他虐待者，是我親見親聞的事，今寫寄本刋，以見這種慘無人道的行爲，竟存在這種高唱人道主義號爲文明的時代。</p>
<p>我們鎭上，有一富户主人翁是一個年紀七十以外的老頭兒，這位老頭兒，雖然年紀這樣大，但是他的精神，好得較我們後生還來得强，面皮光滑，而且紅潤，走起路來，一些也没有龍鍾的態度。鄰居見他這樣　鑠，都去問他養身的妙法，但是奇怪得很，問來問去，他總不肯說出他康健的秘訣，有的疑他服用參燕等補品所致。本來像這種富貴的人，當然參燕吃夠不斷，於是他人見其不肯說出所以然來，也就不去追問，深信他採服參燕的功效。但是我有些懷疑，以爲他旣然是服用參燕而得的効力，那嗎，這個是一種正當的健康術，也决没有不可告人之隠。一天，恰巧他家一個女傭，到我家來借東西，我就向她打聽，她說：這位老頭兒，生有一種怪脾氣，喜歡買年輕的糼婢，家裏時常有十多個，這種糼婢，買來並不是爲工作起見，完全是爲他個人的健康起見，他將買來的婢女，每夜一個，並每夜給她一個黑棗，等到天明，（此處恕我不去說明了）他就將黑棗蒸熟服用，十多年來，每日如此，這般婢女，經他這樣擺佈，弄得精華漸衰，面黃肌瘦，大都不上兩三年，就一命鳴呼，唉！十多年來，被他害殺的人，眞也不少了！</p>
<p>啊唷！我聽完了她的話，不禁毛髮　然，怪不得他有這樣康健同時又說不出所以康健的原因，原來是用這種損人利已的慘無人道的法子來，像妖精般地採吸人精，唉！他的生命，不是用「維他命」來維持，簡直是用害她命來「維他命」了。</p>

<h3>Deliberations on Diplomatic Policies Towards Japan</h3>
<p>— Bin</p>
<p>Since the fall of the Northeast, more than half a year has passed. Initially, the government merely appealed to the League of Nations for help, dreaming that the great powers would uphold "justice," allowing the Japanese to calmly seize the three provinces. With one hand, they created the so-called Manchu puppet state. They neither prepared to recover lost territory and suppress the puppet state nor were able to use diplomatic means to seek a solution through diplomacy. For nine months, there has been no consistent policy to deal with the situation, and even less a consistent diplomatic policy, causing the loss of half of the Northeast to occur unknowingly. Now, at Shanhaiguan, the embroidered banner flutters, and on the plains of Changbai, enemy cavalry gallop freely. This is truly a matter of deep pain and indignation for our people, one that cannot be forgotten for even a day.</p>
<p>Recently, as the people of the nation feel that there is no prospect of recovering the lost territory, they realize that delaying the matter is not a good plan. Many advocate for the swift determination of a diplomatic policy toward Japan, clarifying our attitude, and urgently seeking a resolution to the Northeast issue. As for how to establish the policy, some advocate accepting the five basic principles proposed by the former Japanese Foreign Minister Kijūrō Shidehara, and based on these, initiating direct negotiations with Japan to resolve the Northeast issue. Others advocate fundamentally acknowledging the Twenty-One Demands that the Japanese forced upon us in the fourth year of the Republic (1915), seeking a practical solution based on the current situation. Hu Shih recently argued in the "Independent Critic" that "China should proactively propose the demilitarization of the three eastern provinces, and neither China, Japan, nor Russia should station troops in the three eastern provinces." "A conference of railway experts from both countries should resolve railway disputes based on existing treaties and factual negotiations." "The new treaty concluded between China and Japan should not only resolve long-standing disputes but also establish a foundation for the two major nations of the Far East to coexist and prosper in the future." These proposals outline nine points for long-term relations with Japan. These arguments all stem from the utmost sincerity of loving and worrying about the country, and they all passionately seek the good of the nation. However, we believe that while a policy toward Japan should be established quickly, we dare not agree with most of the above diplomatic policies. Therefore, we present our views for discussion.</p>
<p>We believe that before discussing a diplomatic policy toward Japan, we should first examine the attitude of the Japanese. In other words, we should examine Japan's recent policy towards China. If their policy towards China is tending towards moderation, then our willingness to compromise, acknowledging all of Japan's improper rights and interests, may possibly lead to a resolution of the Northeast issue. Conversely, if it is one of strength, then even if we offer the Northeast with our hands, we fear it will not satisfy their insatiable desires and stop their aggressive ambitions. What is Japan's recent policy toward China? In the "Diplomatic Times," a statement by a representative of the Japanese military was recently published, saying:</p>
<p>"Japan will not only continue to occupy Manchuria, but a second or third Shanghai Incident can occur at any time, anywhere. This is something that China should realize. The so-called 'Three Brave Soldiers of the Human Bullet' were the opportunity to crush the 19th Route Army, and this should be known by the Chinese. If 60 million Japanese people were all 'Three Brave Soldiers of the Human Bullet,' what kind of situation would that provoke? It's hard to predict. Perhaps the tragedy of Zhabei will expand to the entire territory of China, and the destruction of the 19th Route Army will be a symbol of the fate of the entire Chinese nation. Since the outbreak of the incident in China, the temporary expenditure of military expenses has reached two hundred million yuan. However, at the two Imperial Diet sessions, not a single member of either house expressed opposition, nor did anyone ask to reduce even one yuan. The government's finances are extremely strained, and many citizens are suffering from the depression. The countryside is even on the verge of collapse. But they all gladly supported and assisted with the huge expenses of the incident in China, and they are prepared to spend several billion more in military expenses for the Manchuria issue. At the same time, depending on the trends in the world, they may confront the world's great powers in order to carry out our主張. Before this goal is fully realized, it is of course within our calculations that several Shanghai incidents will occur in the future."</p>
<p>If we carefully consider this argument, its aggressive momentum is truly hair-raising. The statements "prepared to spend several billion more in military expenses for the Manchuria issue" and "confront the world's great powers in order to carry out our主張" clearly demonstrate that their policy towards China is becoming increasingly tough. Furthermore, considering the current intensification of the fascist movement in Japan, the growing calls for a forceful approach towards China, the resolution of the Japanese House of Representatives to quickly recognize the Manchu puppet state, and the Japanese government's rejection of Gu Weijun's trip to Japan, it is even more evident that Japan is determined not to change the current situation in the Northeast. Moreover, their rampant ambition is like a wild horse breaking free, galloping without end. Furthermore, the fall of the Northeast is the implementation of the wise strategy left by the Meiji Emperor of Japan, and it is also the realization of Japan's decades-long invasion plan. Therefore, their occupation of the Northeast is by no means an accidental act of violence. They are preparing to unleash a second or third Shanghai Incident, and they are preparing for even further invasion plans. Yet, we want to seek a satisfactory resolution to the Northeast issue through a diplomatic policy of seeking compromise. Is that really possible? Is that really a practical and effective proposal? We certainly cannot help but consider it thoroughly. As for what a diplomatic policy toward Japan should be, we will discuss it in future articles.</p>
<p>Domestic Important Telegrams</p>
<h3>Guangdong Army Begins Attacking Hainan Island</h3>
<p>Ding Jixu Leads Planes to Reconnoiter Qiongzhou</p>
<p>Sun Ke, Zhang Huichang, and Others Arrive in Hong Kong Yesterday</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) It is reported that the various armies in Leizhou began attacking Qiongzhou on the 25th. (Special telegram on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Sun Ke, accompanied by Zhang Huichang, Liang Hancao, Fu Bingchang, Huang Juju, Han Guiqing, and others, arrived in Hong Kong on the Empress of Japan on the morning of the 25th. After landing, Sun met with Wu Chaochu, Chen Ce, and others, and went to Hu's residence at noon to meet with Hu and talk in detail. Sun said that the trip was entirely for personal matters. He would stay in Hong Kong for a day or two before going to Macau to visit his mother, and then return to Hong Kong and head north. As for the disputes between the Guangdong army and navy, which have been going on for a long time, if they can be mediated, then many comrades are already working on it, so there is no need for him to mediate.

<h3>Ma Zhanshan Cables Announcing the Brutality of the Japanese Army</h3>
<p>Planes Drop Bombs and Burn Down Streets</p>
<p>Troops Enter the City and Slaughter at Will</p>
<p>(Beiping) Ma Zhanshan telegraphed to Beiping on the 24th, saying: "The Japanese created the Manchu puppet state, using the name of national self-determination to invade our Northeast. Now, they are trying to destroy the rich areas along the Hulan-Hailun Railway in order to eliminate our resistance. During the capture of the counties along the Hulan-Suifenhe Railway, they disregarded the people in non-combatant areas and everywhere used planes to drop bombs and burn down streets. Troops entered the city and slaughtered at will, and also raped women. Even young girls were repeatedly violated. In the Catholic Church in Hailun County alone, as many as one hundred and eight people were raped and killed. In addition, the number of Japanese troops passing through Hulan, Suifenhe, and Hailun cannot be counted. Such brutal behavior, disregarding justice and lacking humanity, is truly the public enemy of all humanity. Also, the Japanese army asks people what nationality they are. If they answer that they are Chinese, they are beaten and stabbed to death. If they answer Manchukuo, they nod in approval. Anyone living in or passing through the two eastern provinces must be assimilated by force into the Manchu puppet state, leaving no room for resistance. This is the most extreme violation of the people's will. What self-determination of the people is there? Zhanshan is now deploying various troops to fight a long-term struggle in order to recover our homeland." (Special telegram on the 25th)</p>

<h3>Puppet State Implements Takeover of Customs, Dalian Customs Chief Fukumoto Dismissed</h3>
<p>Dalian - The authorities in Manchukuo have begun to take over the customs offices in Manchuria, except for the one in Dalian. After the dismissal of Dalian Customs Chief Fukumoto, all the Japanese officials in the customs office have decided to resign. (Reuters telegram on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Dalian) Dalian Customs Chief Fukumoto received a telegram of dismissal from Shanghai General Customs Chief Edwardes yesterday afternoon and immediately entrusted all affairs to Senior Officer Nakano to handle as an agent. Fukumoto told reporters today that the telegram did not state the reasons for the dismissal. He imagined that it was because the remittance of funds was stopped, resulting in a violation of orders. He feared that the remittance of funds would cause international problems, so he adopted a temporary emergency measure. There has never been an example of the dismissal of a customs chief. No matter who succeeds him in the future, disputes will inevitably arise. (Jiji Press telegram on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Dalian) Dalian Customs Chief Fukumoto issued a statement today, saying that his refusal to remit customs duties to Shanghai was not on the orders of the Manchukuo authorities. If he remitted the customs duties to Shanghai, double taxation would be inevitable, which would cause serious international disputes. In order to avoid this possibility, he took what he considered the best step. (Reuters telegram on the 25th)</p>
<p>Dalian - Because Dalian Customs is located within the administrative area of the Guandong Leased Territory, the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of Manchukuo, Ōhashi, sent a note to the Guandong Leased Territory, requesting understanding. The note is as follows: "Manchukuo will use force to take over Dalian Customs and hopes to cooperate. If cooperation is not possible, please acknowledge the takeover." (Dentsu News Agency telegram on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to financial circles, the government will resolutely protest the Japanese instigating puppet organizations to seize the customs of the Northeast in order to restore its original state. If necessary, the government will not hesitate to close the customs offices, even at the cost of sacrifice, and the responsibility for all losses incurred as a result should be borne by the Japanese. (Special telegram on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government has protested to the Chinese government regarding the dismissal of Dalian Customs Chief Fukumoto. The Japanese government stated that this action by the Chinese government violates Article 3 of the 1907 Agreement, which stipulates that Dalian customs personnel cannot be appointed or dismissed without the prior consent of the Governor of the Guandong Leased Territory. Negotiations are currently underway in Beiping to reach a peaceful solution, but the Chinese government disregarded the negotiations and took this arbitrary action. The Japanese government hereby lodges a protest and declares that the Chinese government will be responsible for any developments arising therefrom. (Reuters telegram on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It is reported that the Manchukuo authorities are now earnestly preparing that if Dalian customs duties are not delivered to Changchun, they will set up a customs office in Wafangdian, on the border of the Guandong Leased Territory. Official circles here are uneasy upon hearing this news, as this move will create double taxation. Those who are not closely watching the situation in official circles believe that the dismissal of Dalian Customs Chief Fukumoto has opened the door for negotiations between the Japanese and Manchukuo governments on the entire issue of customs in the three eastern provinces. This is why the Japanese government has stated to the Chinese government that China will be responsible for any developments arising therefrom. Although it is rumored that Japan may not recognize the new Manchukuo until the Lytton Commission's report is released, it is expected that Uchida will likely take office as Foreign Minister on July 5. His first action after taking office will be to issue a statement explaining Japan's views on the three eastern provinces. (Reuters telegram on the 25th)</p>

<p>Foreign Important Telegrams</p>
<h3>Siamese Revolution Succeeds Bloodlessly</h3>
<p>Army and Navy Launch Surprise Attack at Night</p>
<p>Overthrow Despotism to Establish Constitutionalism</p>
<p>King Safe, Still Supported as Monarch</p>
<p>Reuters, Bangkok, 24th: A revolution suddenly broke out in Siam's army and navy today. A constitutional system was established this afternoon to replace the despotic system, and King Prajadhipok was elected as the first constitutional monarch of Siam. Several princes and ministers are still under detention. It is reported that the Chief of Staff has been killed.</p>
<p>Guomin, Bangkok, 24th: According to information obtained by the American Legation here, the King of Siam, along with the Queen and other members of the royal family, are currently being held in the main hall where audiences are held, guarded by soldiers. The Minister of Interior is also being held. It is reported that the revolutionaries plan to immediately use the King to convene a national assembly and announce the establishment of a constitutional monarchy, with the current King still as the monarch. (Note: Siam was originally an absolute monarchy.) This revolution was launched by the army and navy, with even senior military officers involved in the conspiracy. Therefore, it did not encounter resistance, and the major event was roughly settled bloodlessly. Only one military officer committed suicide by shooting himself after refusing to join the revolution. This was the only bloody tragedy. The revolutionaries have issued a proclamation announcing martial law and warning the country that anyone who dares to counter the revolution will endanger the life of the royal family. The names of the revolutionary leaders are still unknown, according to inquiries made to the American Legation. Although armored vehicles are patrolling the streets of the capital and machine guns are placed at key points, the general situation is still peaceful. The people are showing sympathy for the revolution.</p>
<p>Guomin, Berlin, 24th: According to Siamese news, a large number of army officers who were known to be loyal to the Siamese King have been detained. The Commander-in-Chief of the Army died after being shot while resisting arrest. Among the royal family, only the Minister of Commerce, Prince Kampengphet, escaped, while the rest are imprisoned in the palace.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 24th: The Vossische Zeitung here received a telephone call from Bangkok from German female aviator Elly Beinhorn, stating that the Siamese revolution occurred unexpectedly at night. The identity of the revolutionary leaders is still unknown. The royal family is being held in the palace as hostages to prevent them from counter-revolution. In the streets of Bangkok, there are traces of the army and navy carrying tanks and machine guns on patrol. The Chief of Staff and government personnel have been detained. The Commander-in-Chief of the Army, who opposed the revolution, has been shot and killed. Note: Female aviator Elly Beinhorn was traveling to Japan on a solo flight and is currently detained in Bangkok due to slight damage to her aircraft. The King of Siam recently held a ceremony for the opening of the Bangkok Memorial Bridge to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the reign of the royal family.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 25th: The Queen of Siam's younger brother is currently residing in New York in a private capacity, studying police administration. A Reuters reporter met him and told him the news of the Bangkok revolution. He was shocked and confused, saying that the royal family had been discussing constitutionalism for more than a year, but no concrete decision had been made. He believes that the King is not in danger.</p>

<p>Fierce Battle with Japanese Police Force for Three Hours</p>
<p>China United News Agency, Seoul, 25th: This morning at 11:00 AM, the Korean Revolutionary Army in the Yanji area crossed the Tumen River to invade Korean territory, engaging in a fierce battle with the Japanese garrison and police force for three hours. They retreated due to being outnumbered. Currently, both sides are facing each other on both sides of the Tumen River. The Japanese side has dispatched over fifty additional police officers to provide assistance.</p>
<h3>Lifting the Ban on German Private Armies Becomes a Tricky Issue</h3>
<p>Central and Local Governments Disagree</p>
<p>Conflicts Between Communist and National Socialist Parties Erupt Repeatedly</p>
<p>Bavaria Clearly Refuses to Lift the Ban</p>
<p>Reuters, Munich, 25th: Bavaria, the second largest state in Germany, has effectively refused to lift the ban on National Socialist uniforms. The Prime Minister announced this decision in parliament this morning, stating that Bavaria intends to strictly adhere to the constitution and laws and will strive to uphold the power to maintain law and order within its borders. Members of parliament cheered loudly upon hearing this. The parliament then passed a resolution supporting the government's policy without discussion. All parties voted in favor except the Communist Party. The National Socialist Party did not attend today because they were expelled last week for wearing uniforms. The Prime Minister of Bavaria has written to President Hindenburg, stating that Bavaria is loyal to the federal government and that the refusal to lift the ban is based on the law.</p>
<h3>Concentrating Police Force to Prevent Riots</h3>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Munich, 24th: According to reports from Bavarian government agencies, the National Socialist Party has concentrated between 30,000 and 40,000 party members in and around Munich, intending to hold a grand demonstration on Sunday. However, the local authorities insist on not allowing it, so they have instructed the police force to maintain the authority of the local government no matter what.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 24th: Police and party members clashed in various parts of Germany today, resulting in two deaths and forty injuries. If the situation does not improve and disturbances continue, President Hindenburg may revoke the order allowing National Socialist Party members to wear uniforms. The Bruening government had issued an order prohibiting the wearing of uniforms, but this order was repealed after Papen took office. National Socialist Party members then paraded in uniforms, leading to repeated clashes between the party and the Communist Party.</p>
<h3>National Socialist Party Declaration Pressures the Central Government</h3>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Berlin, 24th: The issue of lifting the ban on the private armies of Hitler's party in Germany has now become the most difficult problem for the federal government and the Bavarian government to resolve. Because the federal government and the local government hold opposing views and do not understand each other, the situation is expanding day by day. Looking ahead, the danger is extreme. In Berlin, National Socialist Party leader Goebbels gave a declaration in a general assembly tonight, stating that the central government should make every effort to maintain its prestige. If it cannot enforce its authority and allows local governments to act independently, then the National Socialist Party will have to withdraw its support for the federal government. This declaration is actually a warning to the federal government, intended to pressure the federal government to take final measures. Goebbels also put forward several demands, including that the federal government should declare martial law throughout the country, which is a strategy to concentrate the police power of the various states in the federal government and abolish the local governments. Second, the federal government should issue an order to ban the Communist Party and all its affiliated organizations. Third, all police officers throughout the country who belong to the Communist Party should be ordered to retire, especially in Prussia. This is the strategy of the National Socialist Party in Berlin.</p>
<h3>The People's Party Opposes the Destruction of Autonomy</h3>
<p>In Munich, the capital of Bavaria, the leader of the Bavarian People's Party, Mr. Schäffer, convened a general assembly. During the assembly, Mr. Schäffer vehemently criticized the actions of the National Socialist Party leader, Mr. Hitler, and issued a severe warning against the federal government's interference in local administration. Mr. Schäffer also stated that the youth of Bavaria might rise up, as they did during the communist revolution, to take on the responsibility of defending their locality. Finally, Mr. Schäffer asked the entire audience to stand and swear an oath, willing to live as free people of a free state and never willing to be slaves of others. Given the tense situation in both Berlin and Munich, it seems that a direct confrontation is imminent, and in the future, a fierce conflict may be inevitable. However, whether the federal government and the Bavarian local government will split from this point remains to be seen, because the federal government is unwilling to take any drastic measures before the Bavarian government responds to the request from Mr. Geer, the federal minister of the interior.</p>
<h3>National Socialist Assemblymen Enter Dressed in Military Uniforms</h3>
<p>Stuttgart, National Society News, 24th Dispatch: When the Baden-Württemberg parliament convened today, the National Socialist assemblymen still attended in military uniforms. The speaker ordered them to change their attire, but they refused. Therefore, except for the National Right Party, assemblymen from all parties left the meeting, stating that they would not return to the parliament until the National Socialist assemblymen changed into civilian clothing.</p>
<h3>Prussia Abolishes the Ban on Assemblies</h3>
<p>Berlin, National Society News, 25th Dispatch: After a night-long session, the Prussian parliament passed a resolution this morning demanding the cancellation of the ban on open-air meetings and demonstrations. The resolution was proposed by the National Socialist Party and supported by the Communist Party, and thus it passed. The National Socialist Party also proposed a motion stipulating that, in the future, actors, dancers, instructors, and managers gradually employed by theaters in Prussia must be of German nationality and Germanic origin. This motion was also passed by a majority.</p>
<h3>Britain and the United States Reach a Gentleman's Agreement on the War Debt Issue</h3>
<p>No Significant Progress in German-French Negotiations</p>
<p>The Heads of Both Countries Return Home to Report</p>
<p>London, National Society News, 24th Dispatch: According to reliable sources today, Britain and the United States have reached an unwritten "gentleman's agreement." Both sides will follow the same disarmament policy. Both sides agree that reparations must be suspended in the current situation. However, this condition will only be implemented after the current meetings in Geneva and Lausanne fail. It was also agreed that the United States would allow Britain a special reduction in war debts or a temporary suspension of payment, to be announced after the American election, should Hoover be re-elected.</p>
<p>Lausanne, Reuters, 24th Dispatch: The discussions between the German and French premiers have not made any progress. Therefore, the reparations conference has to be delayed for a few days. German Premier Papen insists on Germany's inability to pay, and France is unwilling to follow Britain's advocacy of debt cancellation. The German and French premiers have returned to their respective capitals to confer with their cabinet members and will return here on Sunday.</p>
<p>Berlin, National Society News, 25th Dispatch: German Premier Papen returned to Berlin from Lausanne this morning and immediately met with the president to report on the conference. In the afternoon, he will convene a cabinet meeting to discuss the reparations issue and some of the proposals made by Herriot during the German-French negotiations. Papen is scheduled to return to Lausanne tomorrow afternoon, and the German-French negotiations will resume on Monday. Until then, it is feared that this negotiation will not have any definite outcome until the middle or even the end of next week, and no one can predict what the outcome will be. Even newspapers are indecisive about the situation, sometimes optimistic and sometimes pessimistic, and dare not predict. This morning, newspaper editorials only had one common opinion: yesterday's direct negotiations between German and French representatives made no progress. The French representatives insisted that payments must be made in the future, and the German representatives were equally determined to argue that they were unable to pay. In addition, the German World News reported that Herriot undoubtedly wants to resolve this matter urgently, but today Herriot is in fact constrained by his own words. Herriot has often told the French that Germany can still pay and must be forced to pay. Therefore, he cannot return to Paris empty-handed this time. However, even if the meeting can understand Herriot's position, it will not help.</p>
<p>Paris, National Society News, 25th Dispatch: French Premier Herriot returned to Paris early this morning. After consulting with several cabinet members at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, he drove to the Presidential Palace to hold a cabinet meeting, presided over by President Lebrun himself. The meeting began at 10:00 and had not yet concluded by noon. It is expected that there will be important decisions regarding the reparations issue.</p>
<p>Lausanne, National Society News, 24th Dispatch: According to those who are usually well-informed, the German-French negotiations tend to extend the customs agreement of Holland, Belgium, and Luxembourg to include Germany and France. However, when asked, the German and French delegations could not confirm this. Both sides said they did not know about it.</p>
<h3>Internal Split in the British Labour Party</h3>
<p>London, Reuters, 24th Dispatch: The internal split in the British Labour Party may have a significant impact on the party's future. The Independent Labour Party, which has always been affiliated with the British Labour Party, is taking a more radical stance and has now decided to sever ties with the British Labour Party and act independently in politics. A general meeting will be convened on July 30th, and members of the British Labour Party who are dissatisfied with the party are likely to be absorbed by the new party.</p>
<h3>The Portuguese Cabinet Resigns En Masse. France Increases Tariffs, Portugal Retaliates.</h3>
<p>Lisbon, National Society News, 24th Dispatch: The Portuguese cabinet has resigned en masse today.</p>
<p>Lisbon, Reuters, 24th Dispatch: The Portuguese government has ordered the detention of all kinds of French goods and parcels sent from France currently in Portuguese customs warehouses. The Portuguese government's action was triggered by France's increase of tariffs on Portuguese goods by 15%. The French goods currently detained by Portugal can only be collected after the two governments have thoroughly discussed the entire issue.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Government Oppresses the Proletarian Cultural League</h3>
<p>Tokyo Correspondence, China United News, 20th Dispatch: Since the Japanese government deployed a large army to Shanghai this spring, it has severely oppressed proletarian groups at home. The leaders of the Proletarian Cultural League have been arrested and imprisoned. Angered by the oppression of the Japanese authorities, the Proletarian Cultural League convened the second enlarged central conference at the Tsukiji Little Theater in Tokyo on the 19th of this month. More than 400 people participated. The Metropolitan Police Department sent former inspectors to monitor the scene. When the meeting was announced to begin, it was immediately ordered to disband. Angered by the police's brutality, the participants immediately announced a march, which led to a major conflict with the Japanese police. After a long period of fighting, the order was disrupted. Several people, including Meiji University student Ueda, were seriously injured and immediately taken to the Hayashi Hospital for treatment. The marching crowd clashed with police officers on the streets of Tsukiji, Ginza, and Yurakucho. Many were wounded, and 178 people, including Sasaki and Tanabe, were arrested. Many of them have been released as of this morning.</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<h3>The Japanese Plan to Seize the Rights of the Eastern Railway</h3>
<p>Iri Haru Appointed as Fake Director</p>
<p>The Harbin-Suifenhe Line Divided into Several Sections</p>
<p>The Puppet State Plans to Revise the Agreement</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: Since the Eastern Railway was incorporated into the transportation system of the puppet state, the old Japanese personnel have been almost completely ousted. Li Shaogeng, the puppet superintendent, is in a position where he must act, but he does not seem willing to be a puppet. If Li does not act, his property in Harbin, worth hundreds of thousands, will be confiscated. But after he acts, only the superintendent's office is under his control. The directors, supervisors, and the railway bureau are all controlled by the general new nobles. It is difficult to control, and Li really has no way to deal with it. The position of Chinese Deputy Director of the Railway Bureau was recently filled by Iri Haru, the former director of the Economic Investigation Bureau of the Railway Bureau, who was recommended by the Manchurian group. Iri is from Xinjiang and does not speak or understand Chinese. When the puppet state was established, he and Zhang Shu, the chairman of the supervisory board of the Eastern Railway, formed a Manchurian group in Harbin, forming cliques for private gain. Many people who were keen on fame and fortune joined the group. Using this power, Iri obtained the position of Deputy Director of the Railway Bureau. Although Li Shaogeng opposed it, there was nothing he could do. Now, nine out of ten of the heads of the Railway Bureau have been replaced. Those with some technical knowledge in the past, if they were not from the Manchurian group, were all ousted. The newly appointed ones are all about eating and taking money, reporting small matters to Iri and major matters to the Japanese side. In reality, it is the same as the semi-Manchurian system. The Soviet Union has not expressed any opinion on this. What they are most concerned about at the moment is how to plunder the railway property and transport it to Russia. Since February, vehicles on the Harbin-Suifenhe line have only gone to Ashihe. At the furthest, they only went to Suifenhe. The traffic to Vladivostok has long been cut off. Since the Soviet Union does not pay attention to railway matters, it is not eager to restore the entire Harbin-Suifenhe line. As a result, railway operations are fragmented, opening an unprecedented era of chaos. The Russians turn a blind eye to it. Recently, the section of the Harbin-Suifenhe line between Hengdaohe and Yimianpo has been directly managed by the Japanese army, and employees of the South Manchuria Railway and railway corps have been transferred to serve on the line. The Russian side does not dare to interfere. This section now belongs to the Japanese. The section above Hengdaohe, up to Suifenhe, is managed by the National Salvation Army. All daily traffic is controlled by the army. The area between Ashihe and Yimianpo is the most chaotic. Because the self-defense army uses the terrain for combat, many sections of the railway have been dismantled, and traffic is intermittent. The Russians can do nothing about it. This belongs to the problems of the railway itself. Recently, the Japanese want to bring the Eastern Railway under their control, as the entire Northeast has already been conquered. However, they cannot directly speak out, so they manipulate the puppet state's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Transportation to instruct Li Shaogeng, the superintendent of the Eastern Railway, to propose to the Russian directors and supervisors to revise all or part of the Sino-Russian and Fengtian-Russian agreements (specifically referring to the Eastern Railway portion) and to return the Eastern Railway passenger and freight cars and property detained in the Soviet Union. Therefore, Li Shaogeng</p>
<h2>Page 9</h2>
<p>Continuation of Important News</p>
<p>At the recent meeting of directors and supervisors, Li Shaogeng proposed this on the spot. The Russian side did not respond. A few days after the meeting, the Russian Deputy Director Nietzschev said that he had received an order from his government that if it wanted to revise the Sino-Russian and Fengtian-Russian agreements, whether in whole or in part, the Soviet Union would agree, but it must first discuss the outstanding cases of the Eastern Railway, such as the rights of education, shipping, and electricity. As for the railway cars in Russia, they will be mortgaged first, and when a meeting is convened and a solution is agreed upon, they will be returned in full. This reply from the Soviet Union is tantamount to rejecting the puppet state's proposal. However, the Japanese want to control the Eastern Railway and complete its new colonial transportation line. Since they cannot directly intervene, they naturally have to manipulate the puppet state to take the first step in revising the Fengtian-Russian and Sino-Russian agreements to obtain the right to inherit China's Eastern Railway. Now that the Eastern Railway has been rejected, they plan to start through diplomatic means. Therefore, Odahashi Tadaichi, the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of the puppet state, came to Harbin on the 14th of this month and held negotiations with Slautsky, the Russian consul in Harbin, on the evening of the 15th. He has not left Harbin yet. The negotiations are roughly divided into two matters: one is the dispatch of consuls to the coastal region, and the other is the revision of the Fengtian-Russian and Sino-Russian agreements. The Russian consul asked for instructions from his country. He had already replied to Odahashi Tadaichi, saying that he agreed in principle to the dispatch of consuls, but only to the coastal region. The mainland and the Moscow ambassador would be discussed after the international community formally recognized the puppet state. As for the revision of the agreement, it must be discussed by the board of directors of the Eastern Railway, which is actually still a rejection. Recently, it was heard that 240 senior Russian railway staff members of the Eastern Railway Bureau have been transferred back to their country. It is also said that the Russian Deputy Director Kuznetzov will return to his country within the next week. The Japanese side attaches great importance to this matter, saying that the Soviet Union will change its policy and hold a meeting to discuss the new country's measures. If this is true, the relationship between Japan and Russia will become more complicated. (19th)</p>
<h3>Japan Threatens the League of Nations that It Will Not Recognize the General Assembly</h3>
<p>Opposes the League of Nations' Application of Article 15</p>
<p>Instructs the Plenipotentiary to Communicate with the Powers</p>
<p>The Osaka Asahi Shimbun reports that the League of Nations General Assembly, originally scheduled to be held in September, has been changed to November. It is expected that Japan's opposition to the General Assembly will be serious. At present, the Japanese government's attitude is still proceeding according to the established policy. If the League of Nations invokes Article 15 of the Covenant regarding the Manchurian Incident, Japan will resolutely not recognize the General Assembly. However, in order to prevent a head-on confrontation, the government has instructed the Japanese plenipotentiary representative in Geneva to make every effort to communicate with the representatives of the major powers, stating Japan's attitude: (1) Japan will never change its established policy and invoke Article 15; (2) Japan believes that the handling of the Sino-Japanese dispute falls within the scope of the Council's authority, and the General Assembly has no right to deliberate. Japan believes that it is inappropriate for the Council to transfer all disputes to the General Assembly for handling; (3) At the same time, Japan will reserve its attendance at the General Assembly. After the Council accepts the report of the Commission of Inquiry and continues to deliberate, if there are actions unfavorable to Japan in the future solution, or if it denies the existence of Manchuria, a major conflict will inevitably occur.</p>
<h3>The Japanese National League Advocates the Recognition of the Puppet State of Manchuria</h3>
<p>Plans to Hold a National Congress When the Commission of Inquiry Arrives in Tokyo</p>
<p>The Tokyo Kokumin Shimbun reports that the National League, which focuses on the study of Manchurian and Korean issues, is uniting with various factions related to Manchurian and Korean issues in order to recognize the State of Manchuria, and will hold a national congress when the Commission of Inquiry arrives in Tokyo to express the Japanese people's determination. At present, as a result of discussions by Kigosuki Ryosan, Uchida Ryohei, Tsukuda Nobuo, Park Chun-Geum (Korean), Takayama Kimiyuki, etc., it has been decided: (1) In the name of the group, to declare the Manchurian issue to China and foreign countries in the name of the national united front; (2) To convene a national congress for the immediate recognition of the State of Manchuria when the League of Nations Commission of Inquiry arrives in Tokyo; (3) To hold lecture meetings in various parts of Tokyo in the latter half of this month.</p>
<h3>The Bandit Situation in Eastern Fujian is Rampant</h3>
<p>The Tea Market Center is Captured</p>
<p>The Fish Market Center is Surrounded</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The authorities of this province, recently preoccupied with dealing with the red bandits in southern and northern Fujian, have only dispatched the Second Brigade of the Marine Corps, led by Lin Bingzhao, to garrison the five coastal counties of Funing Prefecture in eastern Fujian: Ningde, Xiapu, Fuan, Shouning, and Fuding. However, Lin's brigade pays no attention to local defense and only focuses on forcing the planting of opium seedlings and levying donations. Farmers who resist are massacred by the dispatched troops, resulting in tragic incidents. The local groups jointly appealed to the central government, and the Military Affairs Commission telegraphed the provincial government a few days ago, ordering it to investigate and reply truthfully for investigation and handling. While the military and civilians are still in stalemate, the bandits have taken this opportunity to become active, and the most powerful forces include three groups: one is Li Mugong's group, which is active in the coastal counties of Xiapu and Fuan; one is Zhou Yuguang's group, which appears and disappears in the border areas of Fujian and Zhejiang, in the counties of Shouning and Fuding; and one is Xu Meiling's group, which loots the inland counties of Ningde and Pingnan in Ning Prefecture. Each group has more than a thousand members and runs rampant in one area. The army and the bandits seem to have concluded a non-aggression treaty, and they all choose to station themselves in areas without bandits, leaving the people to appeal. Funing is an area in Fujian Province that produces tea and fish. Now that the tea season has begun and the fish are abundant, it is a crucial time for the livelihood of both farmers and merchants throughout the year. The bandit forces are also very rampant. Li and Xu's groups are united as one, with about 2,000 people. They have captured the three towns of Baishi, Xiuxi, and Shuiteng, which are the tea market centers of Fuan and Xiapu counties, one after another. The tea leaves picked by the farmers and the cash carried by the merchants for tea were all looted. Now they are attacking Saiqi, the fish market center of Ning Prefecture, and it is already surrounded, and the situation is very critical. At the same time, the county seat of Shouning has also been captured by Zhou's bandits. Even the San Dou Island commercial port, where the headquarters of the Marine Corps is located, has had its water traffic cut off by bandit ships. The routes between the five counties have been completely cut off. The Funing Prefecture Association of Fellow Provincials, seeing that their hometown is in a state of ruin, specially selected representatives to petition the provincial government yesterday, requesting that warships be dispatched quickly to cooperate with the land troops to suppress the bandits. The Funing Tea Industry Association also sent a telegram to the province, stating that the entire tea market in the east has been destroyed and requesting prompt relief. It is unknown what the provincial government will do. (June 20th)</p>
<h3>The Training Corps Takes Over the Defense of Wuhu</h3>
<p>The Passenger and Cargo Ships Between Datong and Wuhu Are Robbed Again</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Chen's 57th Division in Xuancheng, Langxi, Guangde, Datong, and Wuhu in Anhui Province has been ordered to move to the border areas of the Gan Province. The Military Affairs Commission has specially transferred the officer training corps of the Central Military Academy to Anhui Province to fill the defense. In addition to the special company and platoon, the corps also has three infantry battalions. The corps headquarters led one battalion to stay in Wuhu, and one battalion was sent to Datong and Xuancheng. In Wuhu, because the 57th Division had been ordered to depart, but the departure date had not been determined, it was not until the evening of the 21st that the training corps formally took over the defense of Wuhu. The military police inspection office was reorganized, and the corps adjutant Ma Qingfeng was appointed as the director. The inns and hotels in the port will be thoroughly investigated. The corps commander Zhu Zonghai went to the provincial capital on the 23rd because it was necessary to discuss various matters with the provincial authorities after taking over the defense. The 57th Division Commander Li Songshan went to Beijing on the morning of the 22nd to meet with Chen Diaoyuan to ask for instructions on everything, as his troops were about to depart.</p>
<p>The merchant ships sailing to various places in Wuhu have been repeatedly robbed. The military and police authorities have never paid the slightest attention, causing merchants and travelers to sigh with difficulty. On the 22nd, the Shenglong merchant ship, full of passengers and cargo from Datong, was robbed again on the way. At 10:00 in the morning, when the ship was sailing to Kaxinzhou, dozens of miles away from Wuhu, seven or eight bandits with guns suddenly stood up on the ship, fired shots, and forced the ship to stop. Soon after, the bandit ship, which had been waiting there, heard the sound and sailed over. They searched and looted for half an hour, boarded the ship, and left. The loss was about 2,000 yuan, but fortunately no one was injured. The ship arrived in Wuhu at 2:00 in the afternoon and, as usual, submitted a report to the military police authorities to request apprehension.</p>
<h3>Disaster in Zheng County</h3>
<p>Four Days of Wind and Frost</p>
<p>Severe Frost in the Morning, Wheat Is Burned</p>
<p>Kaifeng Correspondence: The Provincial Relief Association received a report from Liang Zihou, the magistrate of Zheng County, and Zhang Daoren, the district chief of the county's seventh district, stating that on the 11th of this month, a storm suddenly arose and lasted for four days and nights. Dust and sand filled the sky, and the daylight was dim. On the morning of the 15th, severe frost fell. On the highlands, the topsoil was blown away, and the wheat roots were completely exposed. In the lowlands, sand and leaves were rolled up and pressed on the wheat. In addition, severe frost fell, so that the green fields suddenly turned into scorched earth. Zheng has suffered from disasters and famines for years, and the people have struggled to eat. This spring, the wheat grew well, and there was hope for a good harvest, and starvation could be avoided. However, after the wind and frost, looking around the fields, the soil and seedlings were burned, and there was no hope for a harvest. Although there are seedlings that survive in the autumn, the harvest period is still far away, and it will not be enough to meet the immediate need. Moreover, drought and floods are uncertain, and it is difficult to expect an autumn harvest. Therefore, they earnestly request that personnel be sent to investigate and provide relief. A previous investigation report stated that the wind and frost disasters in the seven districts varied in severity. The report listed the number of acres affected by the disaster, with the severity differentiated. According to this, the winter in Zheng County was extremely dry, and less than 30% of the wheat was planted. Now, after the heavy wind and frost, the wheat blooms but does not bear fruit. The harvest in the whole county is less than 10% or 20%. At this time of year when the old crop is gone and the new crop has not yet arrived, how can my people bear this disaster? How should we reduce the land tax, plan relief, or use work as relief to make up for the damage? In addition to the county magistrate consulting with local gentry to find a solution, the details of the disaster have been submitted to the commission for review. It is said that after receiving the report, the Provincial Relief Association immediately telegraphed an appeal to raise relief efforts.</p>
<h3>Communist Organization Smashed in Weixian, Shandong Province</h3>
<p>Dozens of Communists Arrested</p>
<p>A visitor from Jinan said that Han Fuju, the chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, saw that the Communist bandits were rampant in the provinces of Jiangxi and Anhui and that Shandong was located in the middle, making it an important position. He specially ordered the military police under his command to strictly investigate and arrest the latent Communists in order to stabilize the local area. Previously, many Communists had been arrested in Jinan and Qufu and were detained for interrogation. Recently, Ma Guan's unit of the 222nd Brigade in Weixian County also smashed a Communist organization and arrested dozens of Communists, mostly school teachers and students. They are being interrogated at the brigade headquarters. It is said that they will be sent to Jinan in the near future to be handed over to the court for trial.</p>
<h3>The Jiangsu Construction Department Telegraphed the Shandong Construction Department to Stop Dredging the River Alone</h3>
<p>The Matter Concerns the Interests of Both Provinces and Requires Comprehensive Consideration</p>
<p>Recently, Shandong Province has independently managed the Grand Canal, dredging the East and West Si Rivers and the Niutou River to enter the Nanyang and Zhaoyang Lakes. The counties of Qian and Pei in Jiangsu are located downstream and cannot accommodate the sudden influx of excessive water, which will inevitably cause flooding. Therefore, the Pei County Government and the Tongshan County Farmers' Association have successively telegraphed the Jiangsu Construction Department for instructions. It is said that the department believes that the matter concerns the interests of both provinces and that unilateral water management without prior consultation is not a comprehensive consideration. Yesterday, it telegraphed the Shandong Construction Department, ordering it to stop the dredging work and to plan a mutually beneficial solution in order to avoid benefiting one and harming the other.</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>The Red Cross Branch Distributes Relief Rice</p>
<p>Since being reorganized during the tense situation of the Songhu War, the Songjiang Red Cross Branch has been earnestly handling the reception of refugees and the relief efforts of the 43rd Injured Soldiers Hospital. Because Songjiang is close to the war zone, the general poor households have been affected by the war, and it is difficult to obtain food. The chairman of the branch, Zhou Xuewen, went to Shanghai to the Red Cross General Association and obtained permission to allocate 200 piculs of relief rice to be transported to Songjiang for distribution. A meeting was held at the headquarters on Malu Bridge to discuss the distribution methods. It was also resolved to first divide the area and conduct a field survey of the poor households. Once the household registers of each district are sent and reviewed, rice tickets will be issued to each household, and rice will be issued on a regular basis. In addition to appointing Zhou Xuewen, Zhu Jiuwang, Du Ruozhou, and Bai Tianyi as district directors, Zhang Shengshan, who has been in charge of the accounting for past relief efforts, was publicly elected as the accounting director to review everything. In the year of Dingmao, the association established a summer epidemic hospital, which was quite successful. Recently, in view of the severe epidemic this summer, which has been seen in various ports, it is feared that the infection will spread, and it is planned to gather comrades to continue to run the summer epidemic hospital. Zhou Xuewen, the chairman of the association, and others are planning everything, and they deeply hope that people from all walks of life will work together to promote and establish it as soon as possible. This is of great importance to public health.</p>
<p>The Aftermath of the Robbery in the Business District</p>
<p>After the Songjiang branch of the Chinese Industrial and Commercial Bank was robbed in broad daylight the other day, not only the financial community was filled with fear, but also the shops were on high alert. The County Chamber of Commerce held an informal discussion yesterday to make amends for the loss, and it was proposed to organize a special defense team in the city, recruiting 20 security guards. The funding will be 5,000 yuan as the standard, to be borne by various merchants and wealthy people. Yang Zhimin, Zhu Huisheng, and others were appointed as drafting members, Shu Baoshan and Zhang Shengshan as fundraising members, and Cai Zhongyu and Song Ruoyu as preparatory members. They will actively prepare immediately so that it can be established in the shortest possible time.</p>
<h3>Qingpu</h3>
<p>The Chonggu Patrol Officer is Accused</p>
<p>Recently, Zhu Shizhi, the district chief of the ninth district of the county, has reported to the county government and the county public security bureau that Chen Lianzhi, the patrol officer of the Chonggu branch office in the district, has neglected his duties and violated the law. The county government has instructed to investigate, and the county bureau has also sent Wang, a staff member, to the town for a thorough investigation.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Resolutely Oppose the Special Business Tax: The Jiangsu Provincial Government, facing significant debt due to financial difficulties, has introduced a special business tax. While the tax rates are classified into six categories, the specific items number over 360, sparking opposition from chambers of commerce in Shanghai, Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Zhenjiang, and trade associations such as the Wuxi Oil Factory and Grain Guild. The Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Commerce, after receiving requests from various county chambers of commerce to telegraph the Executive Yuan and Ministry of Finance to halt the tax, forwarded the request to the Yuan and Ministry. An explicit order to abolish the tax was issued. However, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, citing its dire financial situation, has not stopped the tax despite the Yuan's order and plans to implement it on July 1st. Several days ago, it summoned preparation members from various counties to the province to discuss the implementation procedures. Wang Xinru, the preparation member from Wuxi, also attended the meeting and submitted a detailed report on the taxable amount in Wuxi to the Department of Finance. However, merchants and residents of various counties believe that after years of famine and the impact of war, with financial stagnation and no reduction in various levies, and without government relief, it is impossible to bear further burdens. Therefore, they will fully oppose the special business tax, regardless of how the provincial government tries to collect it, even at the cost of everything. The Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce, after receiving requests from various industries to convene an emergency meeting of all members, held an emergency meeting yesterday (the 24th) at 3 PM at the chamber. Qian Sunqing was elected as chairman to report on the process of repeatedly attending the Provincial Federation of Commerce to oppose the tax. Over 100 members attended and unanimously opposed the tax. The atmosphere at the meeting was very tense. There were two reasons for the opposition: (1) The implementation of the special business tax will inevitably lead to increased prices and a higher cost of living, potentially creating a situation similar to the terror in provinces like Fujian, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Anhui. (2) If the provincial government does not heed the explicit order of the Yuan and Ministry, merchants will not heed the explicit orders of the provincial government. The meeting concluded at 4:30 PM with three resolutions: (1) issue a circular telegram, (2) distribute a declaration, and (3) organize a Tax Rate Research Committee. Chen Zhanru, Chen Jinli, and Cheng Jingtang were appointed as committee members, to be convened by Chen Zhanru. The meeting then discussed the issue of clearing enemy goods as ordered, and resolved: (1) Various industries will take an oath on a set date to never purchase enemy goods again, (2) Jiang Jinghai and Jiang Hanqing were appointed as members of the Clearing Enemy Goods Committee, to be convened by Jiang Jinghai. The meeting then adjourned.</p>
<p>A Farmhouse Burglary in Jinqiao Township: Two households, Wei Peiquan and Wei Zhen'an, farmers from Weijia Lane, Cangqiao Township, Fifth District, were burglarized. At about 1 AM the day before yesterday, 13 bandits armed with pistols and other weapons scaled the wall and entered the Wei residence. The men and women of the Wei family were turned upside down and looted at will. 60 silver dollars, 6 silver ingots, 2 gold rings, 2 wooden boxes, and 1 rattan box were stolen, totaling over 700 yuan in losses. The next day, the victims reported the incident to the 13th sub-bureau of the Public Security Bureau, which forwarded the report to the County Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>
<p>Oil Firm Shareholder Accused of Embezzlement: The Wang Yuan Chang Oil Firm, located outside the North Gate along the river, is jointly owned by the brothers Wang Yaoqian, Wang Pushan, and Wang Baoshan. It is a large-scale operation with prosperous business. The accountant, Wang Jing, is the son of Wang Baoshan. Both father and son are keen on speculative ventures and often engage in private exchange transactions. However, due to years of failures and significant losses, they embezzled over 18,000 yuan from the firm. Recently, Wang Yaoqian and Wang Pushan discovered the embezzlement while auditing the accounts and filed a criminal lawsuit with the court. Wang Baoshan and his son went into hiding. Yesterday, Wang Jing was found and immediately handed over to the Fifth Sub-bureau of the Public Security Bureau, which transferred him to the County Court for interrogation. Furthermore, the Shen Changyuan Rice Firm in Chunyang Town, Jiangyin, also suffered losses due to speculative failures, owing 200,100 yuan to money shops such as Yongji Run in this county. The debt has been overdue for a long time. Yesterday, eight money shops, including Yongji Run, sent a letter to the Money Trade Association, which forwarded it to the national and provincial authorities, requesting the arrest and detention of Shen Jinqing and his two brothers, the owners of the firm, to ensure the recovery of the debt.</p>
<p>Private Trafficking of Draft Cattle Confiscated and Punished: The first detachment of the sixth team of the Second District of the Water Police stationed in Wuxi intercepted Yuan Mingdou, who was privately trafficking draft cattle, along with 61 head of cattle, in the Huangbu area. They were immediately transferred to the County Government for interrogation. However, the suspect carried a passport issued by the Danyang County Government, stating that according to the report submitted by Zhu Qikui, chairman of the Danyang Cattle Industry Association, on behalf of cattle merchants Zhu Ding and Zhu Ziyin, the 61 head of cattle were being transported to the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau for use in planting vaccine. County Magistrate Chen immediately submitted a request to the Department of Civil Affairs for instructions. It is now known that Director Zhao has approved the official letter from the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, stating that although the Danyang Dehua Public Welfare Two Cattle Firms were previously entrusted to purchase cattle, the order has long been terminated. After receiving the letter, Director Zhao determined that the cattle merchant was clearly engaged in private trafficking and specifically instructed the county government to confiscate all the cattle in accordance with Article 2 of the Provisional Regulations on Trafficking and Slaughtering Draft Cattle and impose a fine. As for the Danyang County Magistrate, who issued the passport improperly, a separate investigation will be conducted for disciplinary action.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Latest News on the Kidnapping Case in Shazhou City: On the 16th of this month, over 20 bandits impersonating anti-smuggling team members in Xiaosha area, Changyinsha, Shazhou City, Fourth District of this county, first tied up and disarmed six members of the local security corps, then kidnapped Liu Defeng, Xue Wang, and one other person from nearby. It has been many days since the kidnapping and there has been no news of their whereabouts. Yesterday (the 23rd), two local gentry, Tang Jing'an and Zhang Jianliu, suddenly received a letter from Shanghai, presumably sent by the bandits. The letter stated that the three hostages are safe and sound in Shanghai, and asked them to inform their families to prepare the ransom and come to retrieve them. However, all the families of the hostages are extremely impoverished, and it's uncertain where such a large amount of money for ransom can be obtained. Hence, each of the families is in a state of extreme anxiety.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Inmate Attempted Jailbreak But Failed: Wu Guoguang, warden of the Wuyi Local Prison and head of the detention center, discovered inmate Guo Jinzhuang missing during a gate count at noon on the 24th. A search was immediately conducted, and Guo Jinzhuang, Zhong Shi, and Zhang Guiting were found hiding in a pile of straw in the North Cell's patrol route. A round hole was discovered at the base of the wall, prepared for a jailbreak attempt. After strict interrogation, they were shackled and reported to the county government for instructions. County Magistrate Zhang sent Qian Tangxin to inspect the site and sent a letter to the 155th Brigade Headquarters for further investigation. Brigade Commander Huang Gu was greatly angered and immediately brought the three soldiers back for interrogation. Zhong Shi and Guo Jinzhuang, who initiated the plan, were tied up and executed by firing squad at Fengweidun at around 10 AM this morning (the 25th).</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>The Leader of the Jia Group Reports the Circumstances of Deserting Soldiers: Gu Xiting and others from Zhongzheng Township reported to the county government that Zou, the leader of the Second Jia Group, was hoarding and privately selling firearms, dereliction of duty, and harming the people. In particular, the attempt to seize deserting soldiers' firearms led to a conflict with the stationed army, and the firearms within the group were confiscated. County Magistrate Zou submitted his own defense, stating that on April 4th, over 20 deserting soldiers from a company of the first regiment of the 47th division stationed in Changshu were resisted and fled westward by the Yangku Security Group. On the morning of the 5th, they reached Hucao Port. He intended to go there to resolve the situation as ordered, but because the deserting soldiers had grenades, they listened to others and fled. Later, the first division and fourth regiment dispatched troops to pursue them, but because the deserting soldiers had gone elsewhere, they blamed the Second Jia Group, confiscated the firearms of the group members, and took away 15 group members. After negotiations by the county government, the 8th and 9th companies of Wangdai Town were ordered to return the firearms. Later, Wang Xinghan, the company commander of the first battalion of the third regiment of the 47th division, also led three companies of soldiers from Hucao Port to track down the deserting soldiers and searched house by house. Fortunately, Ma Zao, the director of the group affairs, persuaded the company commander, and the next day, they led the team elsewhere. He spent 124 yuan on entertaining expenses, and these expenses have not been settled. The above facts show that there was no intention to seize the firearms of the deserting soldiers or cause a conflict.</p>

<h3>Chinese National Amateur Athletic Federation Cables the Olympic Committee Requesting Accommodations to Participate</h3>
<p>Once the Committee Approves,</p>
<p>Liu Can Depart</p>
<p>After the announcement that the Chinese National Amateur Athletic Federation had decided not to send athletes to the World Games, the Japanese immediately used their manipulative tactics to spread propaganda in the newspapers, hoping to sow discord among the Chinese. Given our country's current difficult situation, it seems that sending athletes to the World Games is indispensable to maintain our international standing. The Federation, therefore, intends to send Liu Changchun alone to the Games. On the 13th, they telegraphed Chairman Zhang Boling and Chairman Wang Zhengting to decide. After discussion, Zhang and Wang obtained the energetic support of Hao Gengsheng, former Director of Physical Education at Northeastern University, who raised considerable funds in Tianjin and Peking to send Liu Changchun and Xi Weiyi as representatives to the Games, intending to restrain the Japanese and create a highlight in the history of Chinese sports. Hao telegraphed Chief Editor Shen Siliang with the revised plan the day before yesterday, but Shen, because all preparations were already in place, could not change the itinerary within a few hours. Therefore, he did not consider it. Now that this plan has become a likely reality, the Federation has urgently telegraphed the Olympic Committee, requesting permission to participate (the registration deadline was June 18th). Liu will depart as soon as the Committee approves.</p>
<h3>The World Games Does Not Permit the Pseudo-State to Participate</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Claims That the Swiss General Assembly Did Not Approve: Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency): This year's World Games will be held in the United States next month. It was previously reported that Japan intended to participate in the name of a rebel organization in Northeastern China. According to news from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the participating representatives of that organization must be approved by the Swiss General Assembly. The representatives selected by the rebels have not been approved, so they cannot attend the Games.</p>
<h3>Although Few, the Filipino Olympians Will Surely Win</h3>
<p>Hope for Tolibia as a High Jump Champion</p>
<p>Ite Fangsha is Sure to Win in Breaststroke</p>
<p>Manila, November 11th (Correspondence): Seven elite athletes from the Philippines boarded the Ryuten Maru bound for America to participate in the Olympics. The entire team consists of two coaches, one track and field athlete, three swimmers, and three boxers, all champions in Manila. Another boxer will board the Coolidge bound for America.</p>
<p>Track and Field: Tolibia is the only track and field athlete and the only hope for the Philippines to score points. At the 9th Games in Amsterdam, he tied for second place with France's Mannate and America's Hedges. He then competed for the ranking and finished fourth. Tolibia's height is 1.93 meters. The first place was won by America's Kimsey, who jumped over 2 meters at the Games, so there is great hope.</p>
<p>Swimming: Although there are only three swimmers, they are also sure to win. Ite Fangsha, Jackillin, and Ajerotin have repeatedly broken the world record of Japan's Takeda in the 200-meter breaststroke. The three of them all have times within 2 minutes and 47 seconds, while Takeda's record is 2 minutes 48.5 seconds. At the 9th Games, Ite Fangsha ranked third, Takeda was the champion, and La Dimaque (Germany) was second. Germany's Sius, Canada's Smith, and Sweden's Haling are all students of Ite. Ajerotin has not participated in the Olympics, but in the 9th Far East Games, both of them defeated Takeda in the breaststroke. Recently, the two have improved further, so they will surely win in Los Angeles.</p>

<h3>China Youth Overwhelms McLing</h3>
<p>| 104 to 64 Points |</p>
<p>Excellent Performance This Year's Great Harvest</p>
<p>Pole Vault and Javelin Break National Records</p>
<p>In yesterday's track meet between China Youth and McLing, China Youth overwhelmed McLing with a score of 104 to 64. The results in each event were outstanding, making it a great harvest for the track and field community this year.</p>
<h3>Excellent Results</h3>
<p>Lu Yaxiong's triple jump of 44 feet 2 inches is remarkable. The pole vault performance is even more surprising, reaching 11 feet 9 inches, equivalent to more than 3.60 meters. The champion was McLing's Si Huanke, whose height far exceeds the Chinese national record. McLing's Heitesheng's javelin also broke the Chinese national record, reaching 154 feet 2 inches, equivalent to more than 46 meters. Galundin's discus throw of 35.86 meters was also quite good. On the China Youth side, in addition to Lu Yaxiong's triple jump, Tao Yingjie's 400-meter hurdles in 54.75 seconds, Sun Huifei's long jump of 6.50 meters, Xia Xianmo's 800 meters in 2 minutes 12.6 seconds, and Xiao Dinghua's high hurdles in 17.2 seconds were all above-average performances.</p>
<h3>China Youth Fought to the End</h3>
<p>The competition started at 1:30 PM, with over a thousand spectators, full of enthusiasm and a strong competitive spirit. Both sides were highly motivated and did not slacken at all. The competition in the 100-meter, 200-meter, and 400-meter races was particularly fierce. McLing's Jianjiang Tangsleigh was slow off the mark and finished third in the 100-meter race. Hao Chunde and Zeng Rongzhong fought hard but failed in the 200-meter race. Zeng Rongzhong had excellent form in the 400-meter race, leading throughout the first 300 meters, but was overtaken by Blong in the last 100 meters, finishing a meter behind after a hard fight. The competition in the 1600-meter race was particularly interesting. Zhu Shaohua worked hard in the front but failed in the end. McLing's Shandun was a famous runner in this event and eventually won the championship. Dong Jiaxi had a fierce competition with Shandun but finished second by two meters. Xiao Dinghua's high hurdle form was extremely beautiful, worthy of a famous athlete.</p>
<h3>Pole Vault Was Really Good</h3>
<p>Cao Yu's pole vault and Chen Baoshen's 16-pound shot put were also above-average performances. Although Cao Yu finished second, his performance was still as good as before. Si Huanke's 11 feet 9 inches was something that Chinese athletes had never achieved before. Wang Jihuai only maintained his original state, neither improving nor declining. He won four second places in long jump, triple jump, javelin, and discus.</p>
<h3>Comparison of Points Scored by Both Sides</h3>
<p>After the 14 events, China Youth won eight first places, ten second places, and eight third places, totaling 104 points according to the 6-4-2 scoring system. McLing won six first places, four second places, and six third places, totaling 64 points.</p>
<p>Wang Jihuai had the highest individual score with four second places totaling 16 points. McLing's Galundin won one first place and one second place, totaling 10 points, and finished second overall. Chen Baoshen, Xiao Dinghua, Lu Yaxiong, Shan Mai, Sun Huifei, Tao Yingjie, and Cao Yu all had 8 points and finished third overall. The complete results are listed below.</p>

<h3>Extraordinary and Terrible</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>Why has our country not progressed? Why is politics not on track? There are thousands of problems, which cannot be fully explained in this small box of this column! Helplessly, I can only say a few key points:</p>
<p>(1) There are too few extraordinary people and too many terrible people!</p>
<p>(2) Once there is an extraordinary person, many terrible people will echo and rise up!</p>
<p>(3) The few extraordinary people are surrounded by the majority of terrible people; as a result, the extraordinary people are dissolved in the furnace of the terrible and undergo assimilation!</p>
<p>I can briefly explain the above examples one by one:</p>
<p>(1) Special people in the eyes of the public, shocked and amazed, are called extraordinary! Or, extraordinarily popular! Or, extraordinarily rich! Or, extraordinarily famous! Conversely, inept people in the eyes of the public, pitied and despised, are called terrible! Or, terribly black! Or, terribly poor! Or, terribly listless! If we compare the number of extraordinary and terrible people, it is difficult to find one extraordinary person in a thousand, while there are nine hundred ninety-nine and a half terrible people in a thousand.</p>
<p>(2) Once there is an extraordinary person, many terrible relatives and old friends come to attach themselves, climb the dragon, rely on the grass, and cling to the trees; surrounding this extraordinary person layer upon layer with many terrible relatives and old friends!</p>
<p>(3) Suppose, the extraordinary person aims to maintain his extraordinary honor; he must break through the layers of terrible! However, breaking through is not easy. To put it mildly: the encirclement of friends can be broken through; but the terribleness of relatives cannot be broken through! To put it more mildly: the encirclement of parents and family can be broken through; but the terribleness of cronyism cannot be broken through! Because of this, the extraordinary honor is dissolved in the furnace of the terrible and undergoes assimilation! What was extraordinary before has now become terrible!</p>
<p>The sharp decrease in the extraordinary and the surge in the terrible, how can society progress? How can politics get on track? Alas! This has become a terrible Republic of China!</p>
<h3>The Tragic Death of the Outcast Wang Jihong</h3>
<p>— Mian Zi</p>
<p>In Shanghai a few years ago, whenever there were musical gatherings, one could always hear Wang Jihong's pipa. His superb skills and silent demeanor, when mentioned, may evoke memories and leave some shadows in the minds of some people. Since the love triangle occurred, the sound of the pipa abruptly stopped. Now it has become an absolute silence, which cannot but make people sigh with sorrow. His death was truly tragic. When the January 28th Incident occurred in Shanghai, because of his love for the beauty of nature, he drifted to the Zhusha Temple on Huangshan Mountain in Anhui to live, enjoying the strange, beautiful, and magnificent scenery. Who knew that he, suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, would pass away in the deep mountains and ancient temples due to poor nutrition and environment. He died in poverty, without relatives or friends. An old monk was the one who took care of his burial. When this news spread, everyone who knew him in life felt sadness, especially those friends who spent every day with him, who felt even more grief and were on the verge of tears.</p>
<p>He was a very intelligent young man who had conducted in-depth research on Chinese and Western music and literature. He truly possessed artistic talent, but unfortunately, he was arrogant, devoted himself to nature, and was not used by the world, causing him to be buried and to die with regret. China's Manshu and Europe's Byron both died young. He also had some similarities. How sad.</p>
<p>Regarding music, he composed a song called "Full City of Wind and Rain," which contained a sad and慷慨 melody and the sound of a storm. Now it has disappeared with him. He did not have any great works in literature, only two collections of new poems, "You Lan Girl" and "Qian Yun." Last year, when he was convalescing in Huangshan for the second time, he wrote ten miscellaneous seven-character poems, which were mournful and beautiful, and movingly poignant. They were published in a travel magazine, but alas, he did not even know they were published when he died. Some of his other articles were scattered in newspapers and magazines for a period of time. Later, he devoted himself to studying Buddhism and stopped writing. His unique life was very literary. The reporter knows it very well and plans to publish a special collection for him in the future. I also hope that readers can give me some information about him. Mr. Lu Erkui, who compiled the Ciyuan dictionary, Mr. Zheng Jinwen of the Datong Music Society, and playwright Ouyang Yuqian are all acquaintances of his. I wonder what their feelings are after receiving this sad news.</p>
<h3>Amber's Origin in Guo Zan</h3>
<p>— Tao Zaidong</p>
<p>Old Man Ninety-Three announced Mr. Cao Zhongyuan's letter, as seen in the 19th issue of this publication. The letter stated that a book by an Englishman, "The Precursors of Wireless Telegraphy," quoted Guo Pu of the Jin Dynasty on amber picking up mustard seeds. Mr. Cao explored which book Guo's words came from for many years without success. The sprouts of physics, electrochemistry, and science are often seen in Chinese ancient books, but there are very few inventions. Seeking the origin of the words is also meaningless. However, such words as "amber picking up mustard seeds" and "magnet attracting iron" are commonly seen in literary collections after the Tang and Song dynasties. It can be said that the Englishman traced the source. It is shameful that foreigners can quote it, but our people do not know its origin. Mr. Cao has been searching for years, and his diligence is admirable. We should write down what we know to help him. According to my research, this is a sentence from Guo Pu's "Annotations and Praises to the Classic of Mountains and Seas." Checking the "Yuanjian Leihan, Treasures Section," it adds a quote from Guo Pu's praise: "Magnets attract iron, amber picks up mustard seeds. Images have potential connections, and numbers also have hidden meetings. The mutual attraction of things is unexpected," and so on. Also, checking Guo Pu's most prominent works, besides annotating the Erya, is the "Annotations and Praises to the Classic of Mountains and Seas." Now that the "Yuanjian Leihan" has added a quote from Guo's praise, it is undoubtedly from the "Annotations and Praises to the Classic of Mountains and Seas." However, Guo's original book has been lost. It is unknown to me whether later generations have compiled versions. The quote in the "Yuanjian Leihan" is also quoted from various books since the Tang and Song dynasties. In addition to Guo's praise, I remember that "Baopuzi" certainly has the sentence "Magnets attract needles, amber picks up mustard seeds." Also, "amber lampwick, friction to treat wind," is mentioned in the annotations to the "Compendium of Materia Medica" or the "Thousand Gold Prescriptions," but my memory is not accurate. I have no books with me and cannot verify. In short, Ge Hong, Tao Hongjing, and Sun Simiao are all people of the Jin Dynasty, so it can be seen that these two things were commonly known in the Jin Dynasty and became common sayings at that time. The "Annotations to the Book of Changes" by Wang Bi quoted by Old Man Ninety-Three, as seen in the 20th issue of this publication, is from Wang Bi, who lived between the Han and Jin Dynasties. It is only natural that the origin of the words is from the Han Dynasty.</p>
<h3>What I Expect from Mothers</h3>
<p>— Idle Person</p>
<p>Mother, you gave birth to many men who talk and create great careers, but why do you also give birth to many female tumors of society? This is too unfair.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether they are men or women, they are all born from the mother's womb and should enjoy the same education from their parents and equal treatment from society, so that they can jointly shoulder the responsibility of the family and the obligations of social undertakings.</p>
<p>Society is the structure of humanity, and humanity is the combination of the two sexes, male and female. To support this precarious situation where society is about to collapse, the foundation of society must be strengthened.</p>
<p>Mother, you are the first person responsible for educating children. How should you educate children to eradicate the weakness of women who want to control power? How should you awaken your daughters' self-awareness? They should be ashamed of dependence and labor for their own lives.</p>
<p>Mother! I hope you educate your children to strive to create a bright history of mankind and teach them to use the surplus value of labor to help the old, young, sick, and suffering people in society!</p>
<h3>World Tidbits</h3>
<p>— Sea Traveler</p>
<p>In a prison in Colombo, Ceylon, there are three ferocious criminals, as fiery as fire and as strong as oxen, with extremely bad conduct. The prison officials could not manage them, so they were imprisoned in a particularly strong prison cell. Who knew that the bricks on all four sides of the iron window had been eaten by termites over time and could be pushed loose. It benefited these three criminals, who escaped without a trace.</p>
<p>There is an education expert in the United States who conducted an interesting experiment. He subjected his own ten-month-old son and a two-month-old chimpanzee to the same training. After various experimental methods, according to him, the chimpanzee was smarter and easier to train than the child. The child's advantage was only in learning to speak, and everything else was inferior to the chimpanzee.</p>
<p>More than 1.2 million people visit the library of the British Museum every year. The bookshelves are sixty miles long and contain four million volumes. It can be said to be a magnificent sight.</p>
<h3>Pilgrimage on the Beijing-Hangzhou Canal (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Shanshan</p>
<p>(5) Glimpses of Huzhou From the car, Huzhou is a tranquil place, a paradise of tranquility that makes people feel comfortable, although that is not entirely the case in reality.</p>
<p>Among the telegraph poles, which are dense at times and sparse at others, are occasionally mixed one or two chimneys, with black snake-like smoke coming out of the chimney opening. The city walls are short, the buildings are simple, and at a glance, you can see dark roof backs. There are no red houses or multi-story buildings. Next to a small bridge, there is a small teahouse. A small awning boat swims under the bridge. There are no mountains for miles around, and the sky and the ground are equally vast. There are not many figures in the fields or at the end of the alleys. The air is tame and peaceful.</p>
<p>An elderly woman, carrying a bamboo basket, walked to the car window, raised her wrinkled head, and called out in a trembling voice, "Spiced tea eggs." (6) A Calm Mountain</p>
<p>In front of Lijia Lane, there is a mountain. No, I should say it is an incomparably huge stone. The color of this stone is aged green and humorous brown. The top of the stone is a diamond-shaped undulation. Among the mountains, it is the most robust and calm, with the temperament of the northern mountains. The mountain stones are clean. Many workers are mining stones on the side of the mountain. In the clanging sound of iron and stone colliding, we can taste the workers' sweat.</p>
<p>(7) Changing Cars in Changxing Because after Changxing is the territory of Jiangsu, the cars of the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Bureau stop in Changxing. At that time, if you want to go further, you have to change cars. The car is from the Jiangnan Automobile Company. The vehicles are newer than those of the Provincial Highway Bureau, and they also seem wider. When I got on, it was already full of people. There was no way but to sit on the edge of a fat woman, which was very uncomfortable. (8) By the Side of Taihu Lake</p>
<p>After eleven o'clock, the car drove out of Changxing. Not long after, it arrived at the edge of Taihu Lake. The road meanders along the foot of the mountain. The mountains are towering and layered, like giant palms covering half of the sky. And the water in Taihu Lake? I really don't know how to describe its vastness. Engine fans and sails float in the vast water vapor. The end of the water is connected to the sky, making a very obvious contrast with the layered mountains that cover half of the sky. I felt like I was walking on the boundary between the ocean and the continent. My eyes were busy, constantly looking left and right.</p>
<p>(9) Black Columns of Smoke The car passed Jiapu and had already reached the territory of Yixing, Jiangsu. The countryside of Yixing produces pottery. The villagers build kilns on small hills and burn them every day. Black columns of smoke rise from the top of the mountain, growing larger and larger. Comparing this to cooking smoke, it seems that cooking smoke is not as scary. Comparing this to the magma when a volcano erupts, this column of smoke lacks a bit of strength.</p>
<p>(10) Escaped Cattle Since entering the territory of Yixing, the road changed from being covered with yellow sand to a gravel road, and the bridges also became wooden. Even though the vehicles were newer than those in Zhejiang, the road was uneven, bumping terribly. The passengers were violently shaken, as if the strength to breathe had been taken away.</p>
<p>The locals say that this bumpy car is an escaped ox, and the passengers have become watermelons being tossed about.</p>
<h3>A Record of Dwelling with Both War and Peace (90)</h3>
<p>— Owner of the Hall of Seeking Happiness</p>
<p>Chapter Eleven: Looking Up at the Commander's Banner in a Small and Remote Town; a Crowd of Vulgar People Follows the Attendants</p>
<p>Since the old man personally led these two honored officials to come, he would naturally have to accompany them to the Changxing Grand Hotel, his favorite place, so as to do his best to prepare a thoughtful and proper reception. Sure enough, the group galloped to the entrance of the Changxing Grand Hotel and stopped there. Fourth Master Wu was the first to jump off his horse, and with a beaming smile, he strode straight into the gate, repeatedly shouting, "Manager Qin, Manager Qin, come out and greet the guests." Fortunately, Manager Qin, with his earthy appearance, had already received the message and hurriedly opened the cash register, grabbed a neatly folded dark blue feather satin double-breasted waistcoat, unfolded it and put it on over his old blue coarse cloth lined robe. With two or three buttons still unfastened, he stumbled out and ran head-on into Fourth Master Wu at the accountant's counter inside the gate. Fourth Master Wu did not have time to speak slowly and deliberately. He grabbed Manager Qin's hand and ran out of the gate, pointing to a mule cart that had just stopped, and said, "I've brought two honored guests from the province. Let me introduce them to you first, and then welcome the honored guests out of the car." At this time, an honored guest had already been helped out of the first mule cart by an orderly. Manager Qin timidly raised his head and saw that this honored guest was actually a very handsome young military officer, wearing a brand new khaki military uniform. His whole body showed several very neat fold marks. Hanging on his shoulders were a pair of signs woven with small red-gold threads, surrounded by a rectangular gold border about one inch wide, with a star the size of a broad bean embedded in the middle, dazzling the eyes with its golden brilliance. Furthermore, with that one stride, it was discovered that the heels of his pair of shiny, new, tall, yellow leather boots were also fitted with gold spurs. Even if the foot landed with a thud on the ash heap in the incense-burner-like street, it could not bury the shimmering of the golden light. This caused Manager Qin, who was accustomed to doing business, to be filled with an indescribable surprise from the discerning eyes that recognized the precious value of gold. He secretly thought that this great person simply regarded gold as dirt. This was the first time this earthy old man had ever opened his eyes and seen such a sight. He was so dizzy that he lost his mind, drooled from the corners of his mouth, and stood there in a daze. Thanks to Fourth Master Wu waking him up in a leisurely manner in his ear, introducing him in such a loud voice, "Come, come, come. First meet our Commander An."</p>

<h3>Foreign Exchange Turns from Flat to Loose</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silver market saw further contraction, with exchange rates slightly lower. The local market suddenly experienced a change of sentiment. HSBC's listed rates, except for the French franc which decreased by one yuan, remained unchanged. However, internally, the market shifted from flat in the morning to loose later. This caused gold prices to show a rebound, creating a confusing situation. Comparing the closing prices with the previous day, British gold was flat, while US dollars increased by 0.025. The volume of transactions by Chinese merchants was less than the previous day, with British gold transactions totaling approximately 100,000 pounds. Gold traders engaged in "digging far, releasing near," buying October contracts from Bombay. US dollar transactions amounted to approximately 500,000 to 600,000 yuan, mostly buying to cover short positions, with some selling gold to settle accounts at a price about six taels lower than yesterday, around 70 taels. On the banking side, HSBC continued to sell. As there was no market in the afternoon due to Saturday, the transactions are recorded below:</p>

<h3>Fluctuating Cotton Yarn Market Turns More Favorable</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market has improved, and the situation is extremely chaotic, changing three times a day, making it difficult to grasp. This is mainly due to the prolonged decline in prices, from 156 taels to 39 taels. Rongxinghao alone bought heavily for two days, turning from short to long. In the morning, news that the US was likely to extend credit for cotton purchases to China caused panic in the market, with prices plummeting by two taels, breaking through 40 taels. Selling pressure was intense, but then a large firm bought in, leading to a rebound and pushing prices above 40 taels. The afternoon situation remained tense. Currently, the market is in a turbulent state, with rapid changes. However, actual demand remains sluggish. Overall, the economic downturn has severely affected yarn sales. Most traders expect the price of standard yarn to return to around 145 taels.</p>
<p>Fluctuations in Standard Yarn Trading: In the morning session of standard yarn trading, prices fell by two taels across all months due to news that the US was likely to extend credit for cotton purchases, causing market panic and increasing the number of sellers. However, prices rebounded at the close, with all months rising by 0.05, 0.06, and 0.09 taels. In the afternoon session, news that a certain country's yarn had fallen by 3 to 4 yuan caused the market to weaken slightly. Prices rose again in the second and third sessions, with all months rising by 0.04 and 0.08 taels. The total transaction volume for the day was 40,800 bales. It was found that Tongyu sold 1,100 bales, Yicheng sold 1,000 bales, Taichang sold 900 bales, Tonghe sold 800 bales, Yichang sold 800 bales, and Yiyu sold 800 bales. Rongxing bought 4,150 bales, Gengfeng bought 1,100 bales, Mingde bought 950 bales, Tianlong bought 850 bales, and Renfeng bought 600 bales. The closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Standard Yarn: Closing Price, Increase/Decrease, Open Interest</p>
<p>October: 1421, Up 1463.600</p>
<p>July: 143, Down 219.00</p>
<p>November: 1423, Up 1162.200</p>
<p>August: 1423, Up 1337.100</p>
<p>Total: 233,950</p>
<p>September: 1424, Up 1352.850</p>
<p>Weak Actual Demand Persists: Actual yarn sales remain sluggish. It was found that various firms bought a total of 650 bales throughout the day, with 40 bales traded among fellow traders. Prices fell by 0.05 to 0.075 taels. Yunnan bought 336 bales, Guangdong bought 185 bales, Sichuan bought 50 bales, Changsha bought 30 bales, and other inland areas bought 21 bales.</p>
<h3>Mediocre Cotton Market</h3>
<p>The cotton market initially fell but then rebounded, with the situation remaining mediocre. However, there was talk of a substantial agreement to extend credit for 600,000 bales of US cotton to China, causing widespread panic. Prices for July and August contracts plummeted by 0.07 and 0.08 taels, but Rongxing took advantage of the decline to buy in, and spot prices rebounded strongly in the second session, rising by 0.05 to 0.06 taels. However, most traders believe that this will not have much impact in the short term. There is still a shortage of spot cotton, and there are concerns that there will not be sufficient supplies for July delivery. Bulls continue to enter the market, and some expect prices to return to 30 taels. Overall, factories have absorbed enough foreign cotton and currently have little need. Unless there is a special change, upward momentum is limited. However, market conditions show that many are buying in due to the low price. Meanwhile, US cotton prices continue to fall.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Cotton Weakens Initially, Then Rebounds: The Zheng Standard cotton market opened lower in the morning session due to mediocre US cotton prices, falling by 0.06 to 0.07 taels. Prices rebounded in the third session, with all months down by 0.05 taels. Prices fell again by 0.015 to 0.02 taels in the afternoon session. The total transaction volume for the day was 94,700 dan. It was found that Long sold 3,600 dan, Jifeng sold 1,300 dan, Changhe sold 5,200 dan, Tongxing sold 2,700 dan, Tongyu sold 2,100 dan, and Changfeng sold 1,800 dan. Rongxing bought 3,400 dan, Xincheng bought 4,200 dan, Yifeng bought 4,700 dan, and Hengde bought 2,500 dan. The closing prices are listed below: Zheng Standard Closing Price, Increase/Decrease, Open Interest</p>
<p>October: 2830, Down 0.25, 149,300</p>
<p>July: 2780, Down 0.10, 58,600</p>
<p>November: 2865, Up 0.25, 151,600</p>
<p>August: 2815, Down 0.15, 104,100</p>
<p>Total: 469,600</p>
<p>Cotton Demand Completely Stagnant: Spot cotton business is completely stagnant. Factories are not buying at all.</p>
<h3>US Cotton Remains Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton initially strengthened due to positive news from Liverpool, but later weakened due to a weak Wall Street and improving weather. Futures fell by 3 to 5 points, while spot prices remained unchanged. British cotton futures rose by 2 to 3 points, and spot prices rose by 3 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 10 points. Indian cotton saw limited trading, and prices remained flat. Pingguo rose by 0.25 rupee, Olham was unchanged, and Bailuo Creek rose by 0.75 rupee.

<h3>Last Week's US Cotton Market Firm Due to Insect Infestation</h3>
<p>Good Cotton Crop in the East, Poor in the West. New York, June 24th: A report on the cotton market for the week states that the cotton market has rebounded from recent low records, with market prices fluctuating considerably and trading being quiet. Occasional showers in the eastern cotton belt have increased concerns about boll weevil infestations. While this concern has not triggered strong buying, it has limited selling. There is no pressure to sell from the South, so sales have been limited. Recent sunny and hot weather in the East has slightly increased selling. Many July futures have been closed out, absorbed by trade purchases and short covering at lower prices. Reports from the western cotton belt indicate good cotton crops. Some believe that excessive rainfall in the East, along with reports of excessive cotton leaf sap and weeds in cotton fields, and the spread of boll weevils in two-thirds of the southern cotton belt from Louisiana eastward, will offset the good cotton crop in the West. Some believe the spread of boll weevils is very serious, the worst since 1923. The weekend statistics are appended below (units of 1,000 bales):</p>

<h3>Grain and Rice Market in Hexia Falls Again by Two Jiao</h3>
<p>South of Shanghai: Yesterday, about a dozen boats arrived from various regions. There was not much inventory in the docks. Shops in the city and countryside found sales to be sluggish. In addition, with the weather gradually warming, it was difficult to store the rice for long. The price of thick japonica rice fell again by two jiao. Rice goods were scarce, and shops still had strong demand. In initial trading, dozens of stones of early rice were sold in small quantities, and prices softened by one jiao.</p>
<p>North of Shanghai: Yesterday, about ten boats arrived. Trading in this street was limited. Fresh northern japonica rice was stable. Medium-grade rice was reduced by two jiao. Early and late rice did not see much activity. Although scattered, foreign-grown indica rice was not well-received. Imported rice sales were slow, and market prices continued to decline. Although variable-origin rice was scarce, the market remained stable.</p>
<h3>Imported Rice Prices Plummet Further</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a New Shipment of 50,000 Bags Arrived from Saigon</p>
<p>Strong Demand from Jiangbei Traders</p>
<p>The imported rice market saw more changes yesterday. Mid-grade rice and lower grades fell by a small amount. Saigon No. 1 was down by 0.015 compared to the previous day, but significantly down by 0.02 to 0.03 compared to the price opened for sale two days earlier. Because current inventories are sufficient, and another new shipment of 50,000 bags arrived from Saigon yesterday, loaded by Yuanli, Saigon No. 1, including 550 bags of medium-grade rice, fell below the 11 yuan mark, selling for only 10.085 yuan. Xiaojiao opened with 2,500 bags, priced at 9.065 yuan to 9.035 yuan. In addition, there were 250 bags of Wenzhou white rice, priced at 9.025 yuan, and 560 bags of Wenzhou rice, priced at 8.0434 yuan to 8.04 yuan. Apart from 2,000 bags of Xiaojiao rice that were bought by two traders from Zhenjiang and Jiangbei, the rest were collected by traders on this street. It is also reported that various districts in Jiangbei, after suffering from severe floods last year, have experienced a shortage of rice and a strong demand. Yesterday, a dealer from the southern market received a passport for 10,000 bags and tested the waters with several hundred bags.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Turns Sluggish Again in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the market opened in the morning, the flour market showed signs of slight stability. Although foreign wheat was reported to be down slightly by 0.01 or 0.02, the sales of flour from Tianjin have been gradually picking up, with another 50,000 bags sold yesterday to Tianjin. The price remains at 1.93 taels per unit of ten thousand, so traders remain firm. Trading was also relatively active. However, when the market opened in the afternoon, customer sales were difficult, with only sporadic transactions. In addition, factories continued to release supplies, so the market turned sluggish again. Observing future developments, if sales from Tianjin pick up, this market may stabilize. As a result, prices for July, August, and September contracts were down by 0.0025, while the remaining contracts remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Turn Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market turned firmer after opening both in the morning and afternoon. Although foreign wheat continued to fall slightly by 0.01 or 0.02, factories gradually showed an appetite for spot wheat, and higher-grade goods in the market were being bought up. Due to the current situation, traders are deeply concerned about transportation difficulties and are reluctant to sell. For this reason, the market sentiment has improved. However, rapid increases may also face setbacks, as pressure from hedging may be exerted after calculating the cost of foreign wheat. As a result, July contracts were up by 0.05 compared to the previous day, August contracts were up by 0.04, September contracts were up by 0.02, and October and November contracts were up by 0.03. The spot wheat market was relatively active. Prices were 2.088 taels for Taicang wheat, 2.082 taels for Baihegang wheat, 2.0923 taels for Penglai wheat, 2.077 taels for Wusong wheat, and 2.077 taels for Huangdu wheat, totaling 1,200 bags.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea - Sales of White Filature and Raw Silk Are Not Quiet</h3>
<p>Due to the gradual increase in sales of autumn silk, inland silk factories have seen a growing need for raw materials. This year's domestic silk harvest is poor in quantity and quality. Since sales of white filature and raw silk from foreign firms have been sluggish and prices have fallen to a minimum, combining the silk cost with the cost of weaving is still worthwhile. Silk shops have started to buy them, and silk sales are not quiet. Unfortunately, trading is not strong. Yesterday, American-Asian, Yunzhang, and Wuhua each imported five to ten bales of Grade B top-quality 20-22 denier spot Shanghai white filature and raw silk at a price of 525 taels.</p>
<h3>Qihua Xiang Tea Continues to Open for Trading</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Qihua Xiang black tea opened for trading by the Russian Aid Foreign Firm. The new price opened at 15 taels, down by 7 taels compared to last year. After the Russian firms started trading Gongxi green tea, Baitu Firm, Yiyulong, Fulin, and others also started trading. Trading was not quiet. The trading of Zhenmei and Zhucha teas from Wudong, Tunxi, Shexian, and Suian was also slightly stronger than before. With stable sentiment, the market did not seem to be undergoing dramatic changes. According to tea merchants, the prices of both black and green teas have fallen to extremely low levels, and there is potential for tea sales to develop.</p>
<h3>Hardware Market Quiet</h3>
<p>Hardware trading has been exceptionally quiet recently, as customers generally do not need to buy in large quantities, and factory spot orders are also limited. Therefore, the market feels rather deserted. The trend for various goods is a lack of activity, with little fluctuation. Although flat iron and corrugated iron sheets opened for trading yesterday, there was little change in prices. Tinplate prices remain high, but actual sales are as before. However, the price of lead was cheaper yesterday due to a decline in the fixed price. The majority of standard specifications have not opened for trading, while the retail spot market is still opening at 12.05 taels.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Fresh Haikou Branch is Arriving</h3>
<p>The wholesale lot of fresh Haikou branch of about ordinary quality in general price range of 10 taels or so have arrived from Qingyuan by transport on the other day. The investigation is of a total of over one hundred and ten cases or so, of which the good are mostly of average quality. Currently (yesterday), the brokerages and the sellers sides are negotiating to set the final price, but as of 6pm the price is yet to be finalized. The anticipated price range is around 11-12 taels for the higher quality ones, while the general lots are expected to unlikely be over 10 taels. It seems more batches are scheduled to be arriving. Provided if there is free flow of demands, this price bracket may remain temporarily for now.</p>

<h3>Sino-British Wireless Telegraph Service Contract Signed</h3>
<p>Based on Equality and Reciprocity, Term is Ten Years</p>
<p>Ministry of Communications Has Ordered Equipment, Service to Be Available Next Year</p>
<p>Will Enable International Telegraph and Telephone Communications</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the International Radio Station, the Ministry of Communications has recovered rights and interests for China's telecommunications industry, no small feat. During the Shanghai War, communication was maintained consistently without interruption. The station currently has direct circuits to the United States, Germany, France, Switzerland, the Philippines, Java, Saigon, Hong Kong, and other locations. However, there is no direct circuit to the United Kingdom. Recognizing that London telegrams account for a significant portion of international telegram traffic, the Ministry of Communications deemed this direct communication to be of utmost importance and initiated the process. It has ordered two sets of 20-kilowatt wireless telegraph and telephone equipment from Marconi Company, totaling approximately 800,000 yuan in national currency. The funds will be sourced from the income from international wireless telegraph fees. According to reliable sources, the Sino-British Wireless Telegraph Service Contract has been formally signed by the Ministry of Communications and the British Imperial and International Communications Company. Previously, the contract faced considerable difficulties due to cable issues, and negotiations had been ongoing for years without resolution. Its realization this time will further consolidate the foundation of China's international wireless communications. The content of the contract is reportedly similar to the previously signed contracts with the United States, Germany, and France, based on the principle of equality and reciprocity, totaling twenty articles. Among them, the most important is the second article: "Both parties shall use all reasonable means to solicit business for the aforementioned circuits and endeavor to maintain symmetrical traffic on the aforementioned circuits." The term of the contract is ten years, effective from the date when the new equipment begins service next year. It is also reported that the wireless equipment is not only capable of international telegraph communications but also international telephone communications. In the future, direct telephone calls will be possible between Shanghai and London, and between Shanghai and San Francisco, further facilitating Sino-foreign communications.</p>
<h3>Disaster Area Rehabilitation Committee Requests Exemption from Local Taxes</h3>
<p>Until Restoration to Pre-War Conditions</p>
<p>The Shanghai Disaster Area Industrial and Commercial Rehabilitation Committee submitted a document to the Shanghai Municipal Government yesterday, stating: "Regarding the promulgation of measures to exempt disaster areas from taxes, they are not truly beneficial. We earnestly request your review and approval to exempt them from local taxes until pre-war conditions are restored, in order to facilitate rehabilitation." The document stated that the committee believed that to rehabilitate the disaster area, the first priority should be the exemption from national and local taxes. A request to this effect had previously been submitted for your consideration. However, upon reading the newspapers, it was learned that the tax exemption measures announced by your office only included the exemption of advertising tax for two seasons, ferry boats, etc., from the date of resumption of business, and the exemption of rent for the first and second categories of civilian residences for two, three, and four months, respectively. It is noted that the Japanese invasion of Shanghai began on January 28th, and the Japanese began their retreat in mid-May. Even now, the withdrawal is not complete. The area was ravaged by the Japanese for four full months. Yet, the exemption from advertising tax is only for two seasons, and the rent exemption for the first and second categories of civilian residences is only for three months. All other taxes must be paid from the date of resumption of business. The people's payment of taxes is originally for the protection of the government. During the Japanese invasion of Shanghai, the lives and property of the affected areas were subject to arbitrary killing and plunder. The government lost its ability to protect them. Since the government has lost its ability to protect, and the people are unable to conduct business peacefully, even if the government wants to collect taxes, it will be impossible to collect. It is obviously not appropriate to call the uncollectible taxes 'exemptions' to show benevolence to the disaster victims. Uninformed people may think that the government is feigning benevolence. Although this may seem an overstatement, the fact is that this exemption measure is of no benefit to rehabilitation. It is therefore necessary to submit another application, requesting your review and approval to exempt local taxes until pre-war conditions are restored, which would be in the public interest."</p>
<h3>Resolving War Zone Debts in a Spirit of Mutual Understanding and Concession</h3>
<p>Creditors Should Accommodate Within Possible Limits</p>
<p>Debtors Should Fulfill Obligations to the Best of Their Ability</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has sent letters to various industries to resolve the issue of debts in the war zone, stating: "We are writing to inform you that our Jiangwan branch office has previously written to us regarding the debts owed by businesses in the district. For those who owe money, the creditors may not be able to waive the debts simply because they have suffered from the disaster. For those who are owed money, it is difficult to expect them to repay the debts when the entire town has been devastated. We request that you provide guidance on how to resolve this issue and issue a notice for implementation." This matter was discussed at the 92nd Standing Committee meeting, and it was decided to solicit opinions from various trade associations and offices before compiling them and submitting them to the Third Members' General Assembly for discussion. Subsequently, various industries provided feedback, including suggestions that if businesses can reorganize and resume operations but are unable to repay maturing debts due to depleted resources, they should be allowed to issue limited-term promissory notes for installment payments; that debts owed to and by people within the Jiangwan war zone should be deferred for up to three months with installment payments, but all transactions must be in cash until the previous debts are cleared; that if businesses have not resumed operations but their assets have not been lost, the debts should be reduced after verification; that those who owe money should make installment payments, giving priority to those owed money who are in the same area and have suffered similar losses; that those who are owed money should make every effort to collect debts, but those who owe money in the same disaster area should be allowed to make installment payments; and that debtors who have suffered actual losses should be understood and tolerated after verification, while those who are concealing assets and evading debts should be strictly pursued. Although the views differed, all had their reasons. These views were listed and submitted to the Third Members' General Assembly for discussion. At the meeting, it was decided that the Chamber of Commerce should advise both creditors and debtors to seek understanding and solutions under the protection of the law and considering the special circumstances. The Executive Committee was instructed to handle the matter according to these principles. The recent Shanghai war occurred precisely at the time when accounts were being settled at the end of the year. The devastation was particularly severe. If businesses do not help each other, they will inevitably collapse together. Creditors should negotiate flexible solutions within their possible limits to allow debtors to gradually resume operations. Debtors should also faithfully fulfill their obligations to the best of their ability, so that creditors are not forced into a desperate situation while accommodating others. Mutual understanding and concession will allow everyone to move towards a brighter future. In light of the Jiangwan branch's request for guidance, it is impossible to apply a single standard due to the varying degrees of disaster, creditworthiness, and assets. Instead, each household should consult with each other based on their usual dealings. We hereby issue this notice, hoping that you will inform your members of the spirit of mutual assistance and concession and handle the matter accordingly. This is our sincere hope."</p>
<h3>Ma Zhanshan Cables Report on Anti-Japanese Struggle</h3>
<p>Ma Zhanshan cables to all circles in Shanghai: "General Zhu Ziqiao, Mr. Huang Jinrong, Mr. Xu Jilong, Mr. Du Yuesheng, Mr. Wang Xiaolai, Mr. Wu Shan, and all comrades: Zhanshan swore an oath last month and set off, as reported in a previous telegram. Prior plans were made to divide our forces and coordinate with the Jilin Army and the armies along the Hu-Hai line, and the Ding and Li units to attack Harbin. Just as we were about to capture it, the Japanese suddenly landed a large number of troops from warships in Bayan, attacking our army's left flank and occupying Hailun, attempting to cut off our retreat. They engaged in rape, arson, and murder, acting with extreme cruelty. The righteous army returned and fought fiercely for more than twenty days. Zhanshan rushed to the front to supervise the troops, boosting their morale. On the evening of the [blank]th of this month, we attacked Hailun and the Catholic Church northwest of Hailun at 10 PM, breaching both at around 11 PM. Street fighting ensued, with hand-to-hand combat lasting about three hours, and we nearly repelled the enemy. It is estimated that we killed over 150 enemies at both locations, captured over 100 rifles, and killed 80 horses. Our officers and soldiers suffered over 40 casualties. We are currently pursuing and clearing the area. Further details will be reported later. Reporting this first. Ma Zhanshan, seal."</p>
<h3>British Also Advocate Convening a Round Table Conference</h3>
<p>Phrasing Quite Clever, Reuters, London, 25th: "Today, The Times published a letter from Conservative Member of Parliament Walter Runciman, warmly supporting the Shanghai and Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce's proposal to convene a round table conference to discuss Shanghai's future. He stated that Britain is not currently involved in any plans to forcibly demand concessions from China that China does not want to grant. However, the issue of Shanghai's future predates the Sino-Japanese dispute. While a ceasefire is sufficient to clear the air, it is not a final solution. He believes that some members of the ruling Kuomintang in Nanjing sincerely desire to use this ceasefire as the starting point for a new situation. The greatest source of power for the National Government is the stability of Shanghai, and this is an opportunity to achieve this goal."</p>
<h3>Journalists' Association Established</h3>
<p>Total of 134 Members Attended</p>
<p>Thirty-Six Executive and Supervisory Committee Members Elected</p>
<p>The Shanghai Journalists' Association held its inaugural meeting at the YMCA on Eight Immortals Bridge at 2:00 PM yesterday. 134 members attended, passed the constitution, and elected executive and supervisory committee members. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Meeting Officials: The presidium was publicly elected as Yan Esheng, He Xiya, Ma Chong, Hang Shijun, Zhao Junhao; Recorders: Jin Huating, Xu Chizhen; Master of Ceremonies: Wu Zhongyi; Venue Staff: Sun Daosheng, Yu Kongwo; Ticket Inspectors: Jiang Zongdao, Jiang Jianhou, Sun Daosheng, Yao Gengkui, Wang Anzhi, Zhou Lianze; Reception: handled by all members of the preparatory committee; Marshals and inspectors of admission tickets: jointly handled by the Boy Scouts of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Meeting Agenda: (1) Public Election of the Presidium; (2) Paying Respects to the Party, National Flag, and the Portrait of the Premier; (3) Chairman Reads the Premier's Will; (4) Chairman's Opening Remarks; (5) Report on Preparatory Work by the Preparatory Committee; (6) Addresses by Representatives of the Municipal Government and the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs; (7) Adoption of the Constitution; (8) Election of Officers; (9) Discussion of Proposals; (10) Photo Session and Adjournment.</p>
<p>Meeting Scene: After the opening ceremony and salutations, Chairman Yan Esheng delivered the opening remarks, stating: "The organization of Shanghai journalists began more than twelve years ago, at which time it was called the Shanghai Journalists' Association. I still recall that when the association held its inaugural meeting, there were only twenty members. Later, the association was reorganized into the Federation, and the number of members increased. This time, it was reorganized into the Journalists' Association, with a registered membership of as many as 197 people. This increase in the number of journalist members is sufficient to demonstrate the development of the journalist profession. The task of the Journalists' Association is to seek the development of the journalism profession and the improvement of the status of journalists, as the two are interrelated, like the two wheels of a car. If the status of journalists cannot be improved, then the development of the journalism profession will be abnormal. Conversely, if the journalism profession cannot be developed, then the status of journalists cannot be improved. Journalists bear a great responsibility to the country and society. Journalists are well aware of this and need not be praised by others. But great responsibility must be borne by great ability. From the perspective of the individual, if the individual's ability is strengthened, then the individual's service efficiency will increase. From the perspective of the whole, if the ability of the journalism community is strengthened, then the journalism profession will develop. However, strength comes from solidarity. The organization of the Journalists' Association seeks the solidarity of the journalism community so that it can generate sufficient ability and develop its cause." Jiang Jianhou, on behalf of the preparatory committee, reported on the preparatory work. Next, Chen Kecheng, representative of the Municipal Government, and Chen Lengseng, representative of the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, delivered speeches. The meeting then began to discuss the constitution, revising it article by article. After the principles were passed, the articles were handed over to the executive committee for processing. After all the discussions were completed, the elections began, using a double-named cumulative voting method to elect fifteen executive committee members, seven alternates, nine supervisory committee members, and five alternates. Next, the meeting discussed proposals. Regarding the job security proposal, it was decided to organize a specialized committee to handle it. Also, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Boy Scouts provided diligent service at the meeting, and it was decided to send a formal letter of thanks in the name of the Journalists' Association. Finally, a photo session was held and the meeting was adjourned.</p>

<h3>Hongkou Silk Factories Striked Yesterday</h3>
<p>Participants Include Yi Chang, Yun Cheng, Xiang Cheng and Other Three Factories</p>
<p>The Reason for the Strike Was Opposition to the Factory's Wage Cuts</p>
<p>Yi Chang on Wuzhou Road, Yun Cheng and Xiang Cheng on Tiantong Road, and other three silk factories in Hongkou, suddenly experienced a strike wave starting yesterday noon, with more than 1,000 people participating. After learning of this, other silk factories separately reported to the police station and requested protection, so it did not spread, but the situation is very serious. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Reasons for the Strike: There are more than 20 silk factories in the Hongkou district of this city. Since the downturn in European sales last year and the sudden drop in the silk market, 60% to 70% of them have suspended operations. The sudden outbreak of the Shanghai war made it difficult for the factories that had not suspended operations to continue. After the Sino-Japanese agreement was reached, more than a dozen factories, including Yi Chang, Tong Wei, Yu Jing, Ren Ji, Yun Cheng, Xiang Cheng, Tong Yi, Hou Fu, Wei Yu, and Fu Lun Heng, resumed operations one after another. Unexpectedly, when these factories started work, seeing that the workers were eager to resume work, they extended the working hours from 11 hours to 12 hours, and the wages were reduced from 58 cents to 42 cents. All silkworm moth upgrades were cancelled, and wages were reduced to 70% of the original level and calculated daily. At that time, the workers repeatedly endured the pain due to the harsh environment, hoping for a turnaround in the silk market before trying to find a solution. Recently, the workers of Yi Chang and other factories felt that their income was meager and difficult to make ends meet. They reported to the union and seriously negotiated with the capitalists, demanding the restoration of their original wages. Unexpectedly, Chen, the person in charge of the union, initially told them to wait patiently for negotiations and not to act rashly, and then flattered the capitalists. The workers could no longer bear it and announced a strike at 12:00 noon yesterday. After the workers of Yi Chang factory went on strike, all the workers rushed to Yun Cheng and Xiang Cheng factories on Tiantong Road, demanding that the workers of the factory take the same action. Seeing that the situation was not good, the factory authorities announced a shutdown and released the male and female workers in the factory, so they also joined the strike. In total, the number of strikers was about 1,000.</p>
<p>Factories on Guard: After the workers of Yi Chang and other three factories went on strike, Ren Ji Silk Factory on Dixiwei Road was afraid of being affected and immediately reported to the Third Sub-Bureau of the Fifth District and requested protection. The precinct dispatched patrol police to the scene to suppress the strike. The workers did not take action when they saw the security. At the gates of Tong Wei and Yu Jing factories on Wuzhou Road, the Harbin police sent a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives to guard the area closely, and no incidents occurred. Tong Yi Silk Factory on Xiangyanqiao Road and Hou Fu Silk Factory on Zhangjia Lane were still operating as usual.</p>
<p>Authorities Investigate: After the outbreak of the strike, the Party and government agencies will send personnel to investigate today in order to find out the truth so as to deal with it and prevent the strike from expanding and affecting social security.</p>
<h3>National Medicine Industry Facing Strike Trend</h3>
<p>Warning Has Been Issued to Capitalists</p>
<p>Municipal Party Department Is Doing Its Utmost to Prevent It</p>
<p>The situation of all employees in the national medicine industry in this city was very serious yesterday, with a trend of strikes. The Municipal Party Department is properly planning and doing its utmost to prevent it. The various situations are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Warning to Capitalists: The Council of the Pharmaceutical Workers' Union, according to the resolutions of the members' representatives meeting, sent a stern letter yesterday to Feng Cunren, Cai Tongde, Ye Tiande and other three pharmacies, which were the first to undermine labor-capital conditions and refuse outside field substitutes, warning them not to arbitrarily undermine the conditions, notifying all members to unanimously oppose them, and preparing to issue a declaration refuting the illegal actions of the guild. As for the Salary Increase Campaign Committee, it was announced yesterday to have been established, and the first committee meeting will be held in the shortest possible time to discuss how to proceed.</p>
<p>Capitalist Attitude: Those concerned about the case, in order to understand the other side of the situation, specially visited Zhang Meian, executive committee member of the National Medicine Industry Association and director of the secretariat, yesterday and had the following conversation: (Question) What is the inside story of your industry's union opposing the division of inside and outside fields and refusing outside field substitutes? Please show a rough estimate. (Answer) The case of dividing the boundaries of inside and outside field clerks in this industry was handled by this association according to the instructions of the Ministry of Industry and the Central Training Department, and not by this association's own initiative to divide the union's organization, because in addition to the inside field clerks in the national medicine industry in this city who have some skills and can join the union as members, the outside field clerks are completely in the position of commercial employees and should belong to the guild according to law. The Ministry's order to divide is indeed most appropriate. This association, in order to execute the order, has resolved through the executive committee meeting to notify the outside field clerks to register first so as to start the</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Division. There is nothing inappropriate in the handling. If the union opposes the division, it should state the reasons and apply to the Ministry of Industry and other departments for relief. That is the right way. If it is used to blame the capitalists and attempt to restrain the capitalists through strikes, I am afraid that it will not be understood by society. As for refusing outside field substitutes, the reason is also here. Since the outside field clerks should belong to the guild according to law, when each store needs to use substitutes because the outside field clerks return home, the store has full power to freely hire them. How can the union refuse to agree with the store and arbitrarily send substitutes to deprive the store of its due rights? Moreover, the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs has also strictly ordered the union to stop the illegal practice of arbitrarily sending outside field substitutes. What is the union blaming? (Question) I heard that the union has the intention of capitalists undermining labor-capital conditions. What is the truth? (Answer) The labor-capital treatment conditions of this industry were signed in the spring of the 16th year of the Republic of China. At that time, various industrial and commercial laws and regulations had not been promulgated, and the contract was not based on any basis, so the content was very obstructive. The central government considered that this condition conflicted with the current laws and regulations, and disputes would not end if it was not improved. Therefore, it specially ordered the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Municipal Party Department, and the Municipal Government to properly revise it in order to achieve perfection. However, although the order has been issued for more than a year, the competent authorities have not been able to do so due to the current situation and the stability relationship. Now, the colleagues in our industry, because they cannot bear the pain of illegal private restraints, have unanimously requested this association to urge the competent authorities to expedite the revision in order to relieve the merchants' difficulties. This is just urging the handling of the pending case, and there is no destruction to speak of. (Question) The union resolved to demand a salary increase of ten yuan per person per month. Do your colleagues in the association accept this? (Answer) This issue is of great importance, and I dare not answer it without authorization, but in view of the current state of commercial decline and the difficult situation in which our industry is, it is even more difficult to talk about salary increases than to talk about salary reductions. (Question) The union has also organized an unemployed group and is prepared to place them with your colleagues in the association. What is your industry's attitude towards this? (Answer) Compulsory placement of unemployed clerks is what this association has always firmly opposed. If the union insists on its own way, a big storm will inevitably follow, and there is no way to avoid it."</p>
<p>Labor Representative's Statement: The standing director of the Pharmaceutical Workers' Union told the reporter of the New Sound News Agency yesterday that Feng Cunren Hall and others have undermined labor-capital conditions and refused outside field substitutes. The union has now decided to issue a warning to the capitalists as the first step according to the resolution. If they do not wake up, the store will be ordered to strike alone. If victory is not achieved, all employees in the city will unite to help. The joint meeting will be held again when the strike is about to begin, and at the same time, the party and government agencies will be reported for assistance. The attitude of the capitalists is tough at the moment, so the strike may become a reality, but we believe that the pharmacy strike is related to local security and has a great impact on the people. We hope that the capitalists will wake up quickly.</p>
<h3>Cai Tingkai Went to Guangdong Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Cai Tingkai, commander of the 19th Route Army, went to Guangdong yesterday morning at 4:00 a.m. with Fan Qiwu, the former director of the army's Shanghai office, on the Dollar Line's President Wilson to participate in the mediation of the Guangdong Navy unrest. He is expected to arrive in Hong Kong by noon tomorrow and then transfer to Guangzhou. According to Cai's statement to others before his departure, he has no mission on this trip, but if he has time when he arrives in Guangdong, he will participate in the mediation of the Navy unrest.</p>
<h3>Fan Shisheng Wounded</h3>
<p>Shot Six Times and Admitted to a Hospital in Hankou, National News Agency reports that Fan Shaozeng (Shisheng), the commander of the division currently suppressing bandits in Hubei, attacked the communist bandits in Shashi earlier this month. The fighting was fierce, and Commander Fan took the lead and fought bravely, but he was taken advantage of by the communist bandits and shot six times. His right shoulder blade was broken, but fortunately, none of the wounds were fatal, so his life is not in danger. He had previously invited the Niu Huilin and Niu Huisheng brothers, doctors from Shanghai, and Pang Jingzhou to go for a consultation. The Niu brothers were busy and slightly ill, so they could not leave Shanghai suddenly. Dr. Pang instead arranged for the German doctor Blancus to go. They chartered a plane yesterday morning, preparing to fly to Hankou this morning. They received a telegram from Shashi that Commander Fan had been admitted to a hospital in Hankou, so they stopped. Recently, there has been a rumor in Shanghai that a certain important person was assassinated in Xun and invited Dr. Niu to go for a consultation. It is probably a misrepresentation of this matter.</p>
<h3>Li Shijia's Trip to Japan Postponed</h3>
<p>Scheduled to go to Japan on the 29th, Japan-Japan News reports that Li Shijia, the standing vice minister of the Navy Department, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing earlier and originally planned to take the Nagasaki Maru to Japan yesterday to discuss the advance delivery of the Ninghai warship. However, due to procedural issues that have not yet been fully negotiated with the Japanese, he was unable to depart and has rescheduled</p>
<p>to go to Japan again on the 29th of this month.</p>
<h3>Zhabei Household Survey</h3>

There are a total of 25,268 large and small men and 20,779 women in the Chinese resident population in the first, second, and third precincts of the Fifth District, except for the area west of the railway and around Yokohama Bridge, where a small portion of the Japanese army occupied several hundred households and the survey could not be started. As for the foreign residents, they were forwarded by the consuls of various countries and will be submitted on time. There are approximately one thousand households, of which Japanese account for 60% to 70%.</p>
<h3>Association for the Care of Fallen Soldiers Welcomes Xiong Xiling</h3>
<p>The Association for the Care of the Families of Fallen Soldiers held its third executive and supervisory committee meeting yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM to welcome Mr. Xiong Bing. Those present included Bo Wenwei, Wu Jingxiong, Wang Boyuan, Zhang Shenzhi, Zhu Jiaobo, Xu Shiying, Huang Bodu, Xiong Xiling, Jin Guanfu, Zhu Ziqiao, Cha Liangzhao, Shi Yuemen, Zhang Bo'an, Wu Zhihao, Li Zushen, Huang Hanzhi, Pan Xulun, Pan Gongzhan, Zhang Zhijiang, Weng Guoxun, etc. Xu Jingren was publicly elected as chairman and delivered a speech, saying: "The most important reason for convening today's meeting is to welcome Mr. Tai Bing. Tracing back to the motivation for initiating this association, it was due to the telegram from Xiong Binglao. Recently, Binglao also played a powerful role in the approval of the registration. In the future, we still hope for Binglao's leadership and guidance in the progress of the association." Next, the chairman reported on the letter from the Secretariat of the Executive Yuan and the four points of the Ministry of Interior's proposed amendments to the association's constitution, which were quite appropriate. The association has now responded after correcting them. Next, the proposals were discussed: (1) Wang Boyuan proposed adding a provision to the association's constitution that fallen soldiers in internal wars, except for bandit suppression, should not receive condolences. It was decided to include this idea when reporting back to the Executive Yuan. (2) The headquarters of the 88th Division sent a letter requesting condolences to the family of Battalion Commander Tang, who died in the anti-Japanese war. It was decided to reply that the association has sent a separate letter inviting his family to come to the meeting for a discussion. Finally, Xiong Bing delivered a speech explaining the motivation for initiating the association, the various methods of comforting the families of the deceased, and thanking everyone for their warm welcome. The meeting adjourned around 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Commends the Achievements of the Defense Corps</h3>
<p>Presenting a Silk Banner</p>
<p>Yesterday's Banner Presentation Ceremony</p>
<p>The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce, in recognition of the outstanding efforts of the Municipal Defense Corps in assisting the military and police and protecting the local area during the recent Shanghai Incident, specially commissioned a silk banner. Yesterday afternoon, Standing Committee members Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, and Yuan Ludeng led a Boy Scout troop with drums and trumpets to present it to the Defense Corps. The ceremony was held at the public sports ground. All members of the Management Committee, Luo Jingyou, Wen Yingxing, and Yao Mulian, were present, and Luo Jingyou, Yao Mulian, and Wang Binyan were elected as the presidium. Officers of the sixteen district defense corps in the city and all members of the Shanghai South District Corps also attended, numbering several thousand, making it a grand occasion. After the meeting began according to protocol, Wang Xiaolai, chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, delivered a speech, stating that the Municipal Defense Corps had taken on rear area duties during the recent war, working tirelessly day and night. Therefore, although the situation at the time was alarming, with multiple scares in a single night and the future uncertain, the local area was able to maintain stability thanks to the collaborative defense efforts of the Defense Corps, which could not be overlooked. The Chamber of Commerce, on behalf of the city's merchants and residents, presented the silk banner as a memento. He also stated that although the war had come to an end, the difficult times were not over. All citizens must unite and support the government to defend against external aggression and ensure domestic tranquility. Public military force is particularly important, and the Defense Corps is the foundation of public military force. If it can build on this achievement and expand, it will have great hope for the country and the people in the future. After the speech, the banner was presented to Luo Jingyou, chairman of the Management Committee, who accepted the banner and delivered a speech of thanks, stating that the corps was honored to receive such a prestigious banner from the City Chamber of Commerce and that the presence of the leaders of the Chamber of Commerce to offer encouragement was greatly appreciated. He, Luo Jingyou, was honored to be a part of this occasion and, on behalf of the entire corps, accepted the banner with immense pride. The Defense Corps, as the basic military force of the people, aims to assist the military and police, maintain local order, and protect the lives and property of the people. After the January 28th Incident, the war-torn areas were devastated, and even non-war zones experienced frequent scares, with people relocating and fleeing. The direct and indirect losses were significant. Although these devastating losses were due to national survival, the people had no complaints. However, the arrival of the incident was beyond the power of the Defense Corps to resist, but the responsibility could not be shirked. Seeing that the wounds had not yet healed and the scars were still fresh, we received this honorary banner, and in the midst of honor, we could not help but feel infinite sadness and infinite shame. In terms of the service provided by the Defense Corps this time, those in the war zone did their best to assist the police in maintaining local security. The duty of the corps can be somewhat comforting, but strictly speaking, the corps assisted the military in terms of strategy and tactics was still lacking, and the people in the non-war zones were relocating and fleeing, which also showed that the defense force of the corps was not strong and could not gain the trust of the people. This is what the corps should strive to do. Zeng and Hu preserved the country with local militias, and eventually quelled the great chaos, as long as there are methods, and the training is appropriate, achieving the above goals is not difficult. In addition to feeling ashamed, we can only strive to achieve success, so as not to live up to today's grand ceremony. We solemnly express our gratitude.</p>
<h3>Lu Tongping, Secretary of the British Embassy in China, Speaks in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The British Public Expresses Sympathy for Us. According to New Voice News, Lu Tongping, secretary of the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom, arrived in Shanghai yesterday on the British mail ship "Glenogle." A reporter visited him at the Yipinxian Hotel and inquired about the recent situation in the United Kingdom. Mr. Lu answered as follows: Since the September 18th Incident, Ambassador Shi has repeatedly attended the League of Nations Administrative Council meetings in Geneva and Paris, fighting for the country and becoming ill from overwork. Following the doctor's advice, he went to Spain for recuperation at the beginning of the year and returned to London in mid-April. Until I (Mr. Lu speaking of himself) left the United Kingdom in the middle of last month, Shi's health had not fully recovered. In addition to the ambassador, the embassy also has Counselor and Acting Chargé d'Affaires Chen Weicheng, who assists with everything. British public opinion can be divided into two factions. Conservative newspapers such as The Morning Post, Daily Mail, and Daily Telegraph are generally ambiguous and confused, and they inevitably have biased arguments from time to time. Labor newspapers such as the News Chronicle and Daily Herald, and the Manchester Guardian, are able to speak out righteously and without hesitation, expressing considerable sympathy for us. As for the public, their attitude is consistent, and they are extremely dissatisfied with the atrocities of the Japanese. The British intellectual class who support the League of Nations have an organization called the League of Nations Union, with more than one million members and branches all over the country. When the Sino-Japanese incident was serious, they held meetings several times to express their attitude and publish a declaration upholding justice. Its influence on British public opinion and foreign policy is quite large. The current Far Eastern policy of the British diplomatic authorities is also subject to criticism from the union from time to time. Furthermore, during the Shanghai War, a large number of retired British military officers and aviation personnel volunteered to serve in our army, which shows the sympathy of the British public for us. Regarding the League of Nations, because the full report of the investigation team has not yet been completed, it is impossible to carry out important work to mediate the Sino-Japanese incident for a while. Because the League of Nations is not an executive agency, its strength is limited, and the powers are too cautious and unwilling to go all out to support it, so it is difficult to predict the result. Our country's plenipotentiary representatives, Ambassador Shi and Ambassador Yan, are sincere, earnest, and unyielding, and are deeply respected by representatives and public opinion from all countries. The delegation in Geneva now includes Hu Shize, Director of the Office, and Luo Zhongyi, the ambassador to Denmark, in addition to Yan. Wang Jiazhen, the former vice minister of foreign affairs, is also in Geneva as a senior advisor to the delegation.</p>
<h3>The Investigation Committee Unseals the Former Anti-Japanese Association Office</h3>
<p>The goods seized by the former Anti-Japanese Association, after the municipal government, together with various agencies and groups, formed a joint investigation committee, are being investigated. The former Anti-Japanese Association office has also been temporarily unsealed, and the committee has inspected the goods stored in each warehouse and recorded the situation as follows:</p>
<p>Unsealing the Office: The Shanghai Municipal Government, in response to a request from the Investigation Committee of the Goods Seized by the Former Anti-Japanese Association, temporarily unsealed the former Anti-Japanese Association office. After receiving instructions for approval, it was ordered to handle the matter carefully with the various committee members and report back. The fourth standing meeting of the Investigation Committee also resolved that at 10 a.m. on the 23rd, the various members of the municipal government, the municipal party headquarters, the municipal chamber of commerce, the public security bureau, and the former Anti-Japanese Association would go to the Quanzhe Guild Hall to unseal the former Anti-Japanese Association office in the Tianhou Palace together.</p>
<p>Inspecting the Goods: The various goods seized by the former Anti-Japanese Association have been stored in various warehouses for a long time. The fourth standing meeting of the Investigation Committee resolved that at 10 a.m. on the 24th, the various committees would go to the various warehouses together to inspect them. There were a total of 47 warehouse receipts: 12 from the Continental Bank warehouse, 9 from the Yuanchang warehouse, 7 from the Ningshao warehouse, 2 from the Jiangsu Bank warehouse, 16 from the Dachu warehouse, and 1 from the Dongchang warehouse. After inspection, except for the 50 pieces of foreign cloth originally stored in the Jiangsu Bank warehouse, of which only 26 pieces and 14 bolts remained, the rest were consistent.</p>
<h3>Statement from the Certified Public Accountants Association</h3>
<p>Shanghai War Losses: Should Be Compensated by Japan</p>
<p>Requesting the Government to Negotiate: Asking for Advance Allocation</p>
<p>The Certified Public Accountants Association declared, "Since the violent Japanese invasion of Songhu on January 28, the rattling of airplanes, the rumbling of heavy artillery, the continuous flames of war, and the devastation everywhere, not only has the land of Qinghua been transformed into a field of rubble, but the tangible losses are countless. Moreover, farmers have stopped plowing, workers have stopped working, merchants have stopped trading, and scholars have abandoned their studies. The intangible losses are even more unknown. Even the wives of widows, the children of orphans, and innocent people have been sacrificed in the ruthless bullets and artillery fire. How many are there? Alas, our people have suffered such great trauma, yet they do not think of seeking compensation for their losses. Is it not a dead heart? Is it enough to destroy the country with the bodies of our 400 million compatriots? If the hearts of our 400 million compatriots die, it will be enough to destroy the country. To avoid the pain of national subjugation, first save the hearts of the dead. If not, let people ravage and destroy as they please, still enduring humiliation and remaining silent. I fear that not only will the powers laugh at our people for being numb and unfeeling, but the enemy will think that our people are willing to endure humiliation, and they may as well make a comeback and show their lewd power again. At that time, there will be no survivors among our people. After the outbreak of the war, this association, in view of the losses suffered by our people, must make a detailed statistics to prepare for demanding compensation from the violent Japanese in the future, that is, to jointly register the losses of the affected people with the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, prepare tables separately, submit them to the central government after review by the members of this association, and seriously negotiate with Japan, demanding full compensation. Unless the goal is achieved, it will never stop. Because this battle was started by Japan, before the Shanghai Incident occurred, Mayor Wu was willing to compromise in order to protect the property of the people of Songhu, and he spared no effort to accept the conditions put forward by the Japanese. Why did he suddenly open fire before the blood was dry? The facts are there, and the nations have seen them. They are wrong and we are right. There is sufficient reason to demand compensation. It is not like climbing a tree to catch a fish. What is worrying is that the diplomacy is weak and the case is delayed, and it cannot be resolved immediately. This association believes that if the government delays and makes mistakes, the people will only have to hold the government accountable and find ways to compensate in advance in the shortest possible time, because Songhu is the Songhu of the entire China. The interests of Songhu on weekdays are shared by the entire country. At this time, the losses of Songhu should also be shared by the entire country. Moreover, the affairs of Songhu this time are the affairs of the entire China and the international community, not the local affairs of China. Since it is the affair of the entire China, the central government should not first find ways to compensate the people of Songhu and let the people of Songhu suffer the losses alone. There is no such reason. Based on this meaning, this association, in addition to asking the central government to seriously negotiate with Japan for compensation for losses, is now making a solemn declaration and hoping that the affected compatriots who have not registered will come to the joint office of the three agencies (located in this association) to register. As the saying goes, 'United, we stand.' Although Japan is violent and tyrannical, if our government argues with reason, our affected compatriots will be able to achieve the final victory." This is the declaration.</p>
<h3>Relief Committee of the Victims' Appeal Association</h3>
<p>Inviting Celebrities to Serve. Since its establishment, the Shanghai War Zone Victims' Federation has been working very hard. It has been making every effort to provide relief to the poor and helpless victims in the war zone, and it has also been providing practical assistance to both labor and management when necessary. The association has now hired celebrities from all walks of life, including Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaogan, Du Yuesheng, Wang Yiting, Wen Lanting, Lu Fengzhu, Gu Xin, Wang Binyan, Lin Kanghou, Yuan Ludeng, and Wu Zhihao, to serve as members of the association's relief committee. Yesterday, the association sent representatives Zhuo Mingchang, Situ Ji, Wang Yunqing, Zhang Jingshan, Shen Xinwu, Wang Zhangfei, Jiang Zhongliang, and others to persuade celebrities from all walks of life to participate. The result was very satisfactory. The relief committee members, in view of the fact that the Japanese invaders occupied the area without cause, causing countless losses to the people of Zhabei, and the small businesses were particularly affected, expressed great sympathy for the association and requested the government to provide relief as soon as possible to comfort the tens of thousands of helpless victims in Zhabei.</p>
<h3>Norway to Open an Industrial Exhibition</h3>
<p>A Norway industrial products exhibition will be held in Oslo from September 4th to 11th. A variety of industrial and commercial export products from Norway will be exhibited at the venue. The previous exhibition was held five years ago. After a long period of preparation, the number of industrial and commercial exports participating in the venue is expected to be greater than the previous exhibition, and the number of visitors from all over the world will also be very enthusiastic. Moreover, there are many scenic spots in Norway, and the weather in early September is especially pleasant. Visitors attending the exhibition can take advantage of their time to wander between the mountains and rivers and cleanse themselves of the world. It is really killing two birds with one stone.</p>
<h3>Anhui Province Cancels the Special Business Tax</h3>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce appealed to the Ministry of Commerce. Since Anhui Province opened the special business tax, various chambers of commerce believed that it violated the principle of eliminating internal tariffs. Moreover, after the natural disasters and wars, the vitality has not recovered, the commerce has been declining, and they cannot afford it. They have requested the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce to forward the request for cancellation. The association, based on the situation, sent telegrams to the central government, and yesterday received an order from the Ministry of Finance, which has been forwarded to cancel it. Now, the Ministry of Finance's telegram to the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce is recorded: (Title omitted) The telegram from Jiang has been received. After checking the case of Anhui Province collecting special business tax, the letter from the Secretariat of the Executive Yuan was approved. The President ordered that the cancellation be forwarded immediately. It has been consulted and ordered by the province to comply with the original plan of the Executive Yuan. Hereby, a telegram is sent to inform you.</p>
<h3>Various Trade Associations Oppose the Special Business Tax</h3>
<p>Since the Central Government has Already Cancelled it, Why Allow the Merchants and the People to Suffer Again? The local Timber Industry Association, Timber Trade Association, Flower Trade Association, Bamboo Trade Association, Paper Trade Association, Sand Boat Trade Association, Pig Trade Association, etc., jointly sent a letter to the City Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating, "Dear Sirs, the Jiangsu Provincial Government plans to implement a special business tax that is a disguised form of internal tariffs, which is harmful to merchants and the people. After repeated appeals from various industries, fortunately, the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Commerce approved the cancellation. However, news has spread that the Jiangsu Provincial Government is disregarding the central government's cancellation order and is determined to implement the collection from July 1st and has set up a general office in Shanghai. It is extremely shocking. Merchants and the people are unable to bear this harsh tax after the disaster. Needless to say, in terms of the political system, the Jiangsu Provincial Government is still a national official appointed by the central government and should obey the central government. Now it is disregarding the orders of the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Commerce. For the harsh tax that the central government has approved for cancellation in order to show compassion for the people's suffering, it must be implemented, as if it has already broken away from the central government and is determined to oppress our people again. Merchants, etc., belong to the same country and are greatly puzzled by this kind of transgressive decree. Even if they are able to obey, there are still doubts. Moreover, they are unable to afford it, so how can they sit still and wait for their own demise? Your association is a commercial guarantee, and you must have a strong method to save the situation at this critical moment of life and death. Our association is deeply afflicted and cannot remain silent. We respectfully request that you send a telegram to the central government to stop it immediately. If the Jiangsu Provincial Government refuses to comply with the central government, how will it be handled? Whether our people obey the central government or belong to the provincial government, please give instructions. We beg for your assessment and implementation. We will be grateful."</p>
<h3>From July 1st, the Jianghai Customs Will Collect a Unified Tax on Rice and Wheat</h3>
<p>Collecting National Currency One Dime Per Package. The Jianghai Customs issued a notice regarding the collection of a unified tax on imported wheat flour, stating, "For the purpose of the notice, it is found that the Jianghai Customs has been collecting a unified tax on wheat flour and other goods since May 16, 1931, as recorded in Notice No. 1212 on May 11 of that year. From July 1 of this year, all imported wheat flour will be taxed at a rate of one dime of national currency per package according to the unified tax rate. The weight should be based on 49 pounds as the standard. If the original package is less than 49 pounds, it will also be taxed as one package. If it exceeds 49 pounds, it will be calculated proportionally. All merchants are hereby informed. This notice is hereby given. June 24, 21st year of the Republic of China, Customs Officer Luo Fude."</p>
<h3>The Garrison Command Schedules Test Firing of Mortars</h3>
<p>The Songhu Garrison Command announced, "For the purpose of the announcement, the command has scheduled a test firing of mortars at Longhua Airport on the afternoon of June 28. In addition to sending separate letters, a public announcement is hereby issued to inform the public. This is it. June 25, 21st year of the Republic of China, Commander Dai Ji."</p>
<h3>Minhang Town Provides Free Injections of Vaccination for the People</h3>
<p>Wu Shifang, the district chief of Minhang Town in the county, in view of the prevalence of cholera in various places and the dense population in this district, and because this year is after the Shanghai War, it is expected that the epidemic will be more severe than in the past. In order to prevent the spread of infection, he specially purchased a large number of cholera prevention vaccines a few days ago and entrusted local doctors to provide free injections to the public at the district office, the public education center, and the Minhang Hospital. In recent days, those who have gone to get injections have been very enthusiastic.</p>
<h3>Two Civilian Residences in Zhabei Were Destroyed During the War</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government allocated funds to repair the First and Third Civilian Residences in Zhabei. Because they were located in the war zone, they were severely damaged. Recently, civilians from the disaster area have returned one after another, and the civilian residences urgently need to be rebuilt. Wu Xingya, Director of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, and Shen Yi, Director of the Municipal Public Works Bureau, specially submitted a request to the Municipal Government to allocate funds for the reconstruction. The original submission is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Original Submission from the Two Bureaus: Regarding the fact that the First and Third Civilian Residences have been damaged due to the war and urgently need to be repaired, a joint document is respectfully submitted for your assessment and instructions. It is respectfully noted that during the anti-Japanese war, the First Civilian Residence on Quanjia'an Road and the Third Civilian Residence on Jiaotong Road were both located within the war zone and could not be managed. After the Japanese soldiers withdrew, the bureaus sent personnel to investigate. The damage to the First Civilian Residence was relatively small, but the Third Civilian Residence was severely damaged by artillery fire. It is estimated that eight rooms, including No. 81, were completely destroyed, and four rooms, including No. 141, were half-destroyed. The roofs, walls, doors, and windows of the remaining houses were pierced by bullet holes, and the damage varied. The original water and electricity facilities of the two residences were mostly lost due to lack of management. Now that the situation is gradually stabilizing and residents are moving back one after another, repairs should be carried out as soon as possible to ensure residence. Regarding the costs of repairs, the Public Works Bureau has carefully estimated that a total of 3,500 yuan will be required, including the repair of the auditorium and bamboo fences of the First Residence. Because the project is trivial and not suitable for bidding, it is proposed that Wang Runji, the original contractor of the Third Civilian Residence, be ordered to carry out the repairs within a specified period. In addition to the costs of repairing and supplementing water and electricity facilities, which have been submitted by the Social Affairs Bureau in another case, the reasons for repairing the damaged parts of the First and Third Civilian Residences due to the war are whether or not they are appropriate. It is appropriate to submit the estimated price list, jointly submit it for your assessment, and if you approve it, please order the Finance Bureau to allocate the aforementioned expenditures in full so that it can be carried out. It will be convenient for the public. Respectfully submitted to Mayor Wu, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Wu Xingya, and Director of the Public Works Bureau Shen Yi.</p>
<p>Approval from the Municipal Government: After receiving the submission, Mayor Wu of the Municipal Government immediately approved it and immediately ordered the Finance Bureau to allocate funds for construction. The original approval is recorded as follows: The submitted list has been read in full. The repair expenses for the two residences are approved to be allocated 3,000 yuan. The municipal treasury is now in deficit, so it is essential to strictly economize expenditures. This is of utmost importance. In addition to ordering the Finance Bureau, you should comply with this order.</p>

<h3>Elementary School Students Enlist in the Army</h3>
<p>Willing to Expel the Japanese Rampaging in Eastern Provinces. Wu Moqing, a sixteen-year-old student at the Shisi Voluntary Elementary School on Pingliang Road in Pudong, is from Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, and currently lives in Lane 2, Changanli, Yangshupu Road. He has been studying at the school for six years and is expected to graduate this summer. His grades and conduct at school have been good. Unexpectedly, he left a letter and ran away to enlist in the army (on the morning of the 23rd). His friend Yu Chongchun (age 16) went with him. Yu was Wu's classmate in the same grade, but Yu dropped out of school last winter because his family lacked manpower to manage the store (a small tobacco and paper store). The two students usually traveled and went together, and they had similar interests, so they agreed to go together this time. It is said that the families of the two students are now extremely anxious and have asked people to look for them everywhere. The letter is attached below:</p>
<p>Dear Mother, I am not going for anything else. I have endured the anger in my belly for nearly a year. Since the Japanese invaded the three northeastern provinces on September 18 last year, Chinese military and political leaders have not sent a single soldier, only knowing how to retreat and unwilling to resist. Fortunately, some smart people in the three provinces have organized groups to fight the Japanese invaders. It is truly admirable and commendable. Seeing this situation, I should have gone to defend the country long ago, but we are young and could not find a place to enlist in the army for a while. After spending a lot of effort, I finally learned where to enlist in the army. If I go to serve as a soldier, I will definitely contribute to the country, preserve the motherland, and drive the Japanese rampant in the three northeastern provinces. If I sacrifice my life, I will die with a clear conscience. After I leave, please do not grieve, because every commoner has a responsibility for the rise and fall of the country, so I am going to contribute to the country. I care for the country, so I cannot care for the family, so please do not miss me.</p>
<h3>Local Court Plans to Establish a Higher Court</h3>
<p>To Hear Second Instance Cases Under Its Jurisdiction. The Ministry of Justice and Administration stated that the jurisdiction of the higher courts in various places is vast, the establishment of branches is incomplete, and even minor cases in remote areas must be appealed to the higher court far away, which is inconvenient in terms of both time and economy. Therefore, it is proposed that before the promulgation of the Court Organization Law, higher courts should be temporarily established in the local courts under the jurisdiction of the higher courts of various provinces to hear civil second instance cases under the jurisdiction of the local courts nearby. The local court in this city has been ordered to prepare for it.</p>
<h3>Zhabei Shantytown: Over 30,000 Households Targeted for Municipal Government Removal Plan</h3>
<p>The number of poor migrants from other provinces residing in Zhabei is substantial. These people live together in family groups and arbitrarily build shantytowns in deserted and remote areas. This not only spoils the appearance of the city but also provides a haven for bandits and thieves. During the recent Shanghai battle, these poor people were even exploited by the Japanese. In light of this, the municipal government, taking advantage of the relatively stable situation, has issued an order to various municipal bureaus to carefully plan measures for removing the Zhabei shantytowns. The plan will proceed in two stages: first, to find ways to concentrate the shantytown residents, and second, to build as many affordable housing units as possible.</p>
<p>Liuying Road and other areas have been designated as shantytown concentration zones. The municipal government has already approved this plan, but because the Liuying area has already been designated for the establishment of the Third Public Sports Ground, instructions have been issued to re-examine appropriate locations. The original submissions from the various bureaus and the municipal government's instructions are recorded below:</p>
<p>Removal Plan – Order Instructing Various Municipal Bureaus to Confer and Decide on Measures for Removing Zhabei Shantytowns. The original submission stated: "Submission Regarding the Formulation of Post-War Shantytown Removal Measures, Jointly Submitted for Review and Approval. Upon investigation, the city's shantytowns, according to a survey conducted by the Municipal Police Bureau in December of last year, number 30,573 households, scattered throughout the urban area, significantly impacting social order and public health. Previously, we received an order from Your Excellency to approve the removal of newly built shantytowns while simultaneously constructing affordable housing units to gradually accommodate the residents. Over the past three years, more than 800 affordable housing units have been built, but the large number of shantytown residents makes it difficult to accommodate them all. Even with continued expansion, it is impossible to achieve immediate results and meet today's urgent needs. Since the recent Anti-Japanese War, the filth and squalor of the shantytowns have become even more apparent. After inspecting the Zhabei districts after the war, new shantytowns have sprung up one after another. Learning from the past and preventing future occurrences, it is truly necessary to remove them. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, on June 4th, convened a meeting with this bureau and others to discuss post-war removal measures. It was unanimously agreed that for the sake of social order, hygiene, city appearance, and urban reconstruction, thorough removal is essential. However, considering the economic hardship after the war and sympathizing with the shantytown residents, it seems appropriate to modify the original removal measures. It was decided that when affordable housing units cannot fully accommodate the residents, the principle of concentrating shantytowns should be adopted. The city's shantytowns will be removed in stages by district. The area south of the Public Concession and the Beijing-Shanghai Railway will be the first district, and the area north of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway and south of Zhongxing Road will be the second district. After successful implementation, the remaining two districts will be addressed. The first district currently has approximately 3,000 households, with the exact number to be determined by the Municipal Police Bureau's district investigation. This area is closest to the city center and most affected by municipal facilities. It is proposed to relocate the existing shantytowns. Furthermore, as the shantytown residents are mostly poor, while many are unruly, some are undoubtedly good people. Considering the circumstances and reason, it seems appropriate to provide relocation assistance when relocating them. It is proposed to provide each household with one yuan, requiring approximately 10,000 yuan for the first district. It is requested that Your Municipal Government allocate these funds to facilitate the project. In the future, after concentration, small ditches will be dug around the perimeter to delineate the boundaries. The construction of shantytowns within the perimeter should be regulated in rows to facilitate management and reduce the risk of fire. These matters will be handled by the Municipal Works Bureau. Internal security, supervision, and hygiene matters will be handled separately by the Municipal Police Bureau and the Health Branch Bureau. Respectfully submitted to Mayor Wu, Finance Bureau Director Cai Zengji, Works Bureau Director Shen Yi, Police Bureau Director Wen Yingsing, Land Bureau Director Jin Xingren, and Health Bureau Director Hu Hongji.

<p>Municipal Government Instructions – After receiving the submission, the Municipal Government immediately approved it. Regarding the address issue, because Liuying Road has already been designated for the establishment of the Third Public Sports Ground, instructions have been issued to re-examine appropriate locations. The instructions stated: "The joint submission has been reviewed. The proposed removal measures are feasible. However, the Liuying Road Xin Yingpan address was previously requested by the Education Bureau for use as the Third Sports Ground and has been approved by this city and communicated to the Ministry of Military Affairs. Regarding the address for concentrating the shantytowns, the said bureau and others are instructed to confer and select another location for submission and inspection. This order."</p>
<h3>Both Bandit and Victim are Key Suspects in Murder Case</h3>
<p>Police have conducted a detailed investigation.</p>
<p>Scene of the murder re-enacted.</p>
<p>All defendants steadfastly denied allegations yesterday.</p>
<p>Magistrate advocated for further detailed investigation.</p>
<p>Kong Guangfu, a native of Anhui residing at 746 Yongji Lane, Weihaiwei Road, reported to the Xinzha Police Station at 8 p.m. on the 16th of this month, claiming that his home had been burglarized and robbed of 580 yuan in property. He stated that he recognized two of the thieves, brothers named Zhou Zhongyi and Zhou Zhonghua. Upon receiving the report, the police station ordered Chinese Detective Tang Jian, Detective Hua Youshan, and Western Detective Ke Ying, among others, to proceed to 3923 Daxu Lane, Laobeisheng Road, to arrest the Zhou brothers. However, the Zhou brothers vehemently denied the robbery and claimed that Kong was involved in</p>
<p>The Murder of Wang Abao. Not long after, Zhang Guomin, a friend of Kong, went to the police station to visit him and was also accused by the Zhou brothers of being Kong's accomplice. The police chief ordered that Kong, Zhang, and the Zhou brothers be detained. On the morning of the 18th, they were sent to the First Special District Court. The police charged the Zhou brothers with robbery, but because the police had not investigated the murder case involving Kong and Zhang, they requested permission to detain them. The court ordered that Kong and Zhang be detained, and the Zhou brothers be held for further questioning at a later date. This information has been reported in this newspaper. Now, the Chinese and Western detectives handling this case have, during the extended period, conducted a</p>
<p>Detailed Investigation and have discovered that Kong, Zhang, and the Zhou brothers are all key suspects in the murder case. Kong served as the commander, Zhang as his deputy, and the Zhou brothers as accomplices. In 1929, all four defendants were officials in the municipal party headquarters, and the Zhou brothers were also foremen at the Japanese-owned Dongya Coir Bag Factory on Laobeisheng Road in western Shanghai. At that time, there was a surge in labor strikes at various factories. Kong and others</p>
<p>Organized a Union in secret and directed the strikes. They then sent Zhou Zhongyi (nicknamed "Little Slippery") and Zhou Zhonghua (nicknamed "Big Slippery") to the home of Wang Abao (also known as Xie Abao) at 2252 Nanfu Lane, Laobeisheng Road (Wang was also a foreman at the coir bag factory), to persuade Wang to join the union and incite workers to strike. Because Wang refused, the union offered a reward of 1,000 yuan to murder Wang Abao. On the morning of December 12, 1929, at 5:30 a.m., Wang was</p>
<p>Shot Dead near his residence in Nanfu Lane and collapsed next to a water tap. After the incident, Kong received a reward of 200 yuan, Zhang received 80 yuan, and the Zhou brothers each received 40 yuan. After Wang's murder, the Putuo Road Police Station, which had jurisdiction at the time, paid close attention and sent detectives to investigate secretly. Because the Zhou brothers were suspected of involvement in the murder, they were detained by the police. However, due to insufficient evidence, they were released. This time, after the police conducted a new investigation, it was suspected that the four defendants were indeed involved in the murder of Zhu Abao.</p>
<p>And it's Not Just This Case. They are also suspected of being involved in the murder of Tan Yisheng, Dong Qigui, Shi Jingui, and several other cases. Therefore, each defendant was ordered to write a confession. Several days prior, Kong Guangfu was ordered to accompany detectives to the scene to re-enact the murder, and the spot where the victim collapsed. The remaining three defendants were also brought to the scene to re-enact the events, which were consistent with the</p>
<p>Police's Investigation at the time of the incident. Yesterday morning, at 8:30 a.m., the police escorted the four defendants to the Second Criminal Court of the Special District Court. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang detailed the above situation and stated that the four defendants were being prosecuted under Article 284, Paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code for the murder of Xie Abao (aka Wang Abao) on December 12, 1929, at 5:30 a.m. on Laobeisheng Road, Nanfu Lane.</p>
<p>Regarding Other Murder Cases, the police have not yet completed their investigation and will not prosecute them at this time. The confessions were submitted to the court for investigation. The defendants were defended by lawyers Fan Gang, Li Shirui, and Zhu Honglie, who had been hired. Subsequently, Xie Wangshi, the mother of the victim Xie Abao, and Sun Xieshi, his sister, filed statements proving everything. When questioned, Zhou Zhongyi testified, "I know nothing about Wang Abao's murder. I accused Kong Guangfu of robbery because he falsely accused me of being a thief."</p>
<p>"Actually, Wang Abao was killed by the Communist Party. At that time, I was an official in the municipal party headquarters and did not interfere. Even if Wang had done something illegal, I could have reported it to the judicial authorities or the Social Affairs Bureau for punishment. It had nothing to do with me. Moreover, Wang was a good friend of mine from the same factory, and I knew his mother and sister. I could never</p>
<p>Do anything illegal. Please investigate." Zhou Zhonghua testified, "I did not go to Wang's home to urge him to join the union or incite a strike. Kong falsely accused the police. Therefore, I also accused him of murder. The 40 yuan was not a reward; it was a loan from Kong." Kong Guangfu testified that from 1927 to 1929, he was an official in the municipal party headquarters. Presiding Magistrate Wu Tingqi asked him if the deceased, Wang Abao, was a foreman at the coir bag factory and that he had ordered him to strike but failed. So, he had him beaten to death with a reward of 1,000 yuan,</p>
<p>"You got 200 yuan. Zhang Guomin got 80 yuan. The Zhou brothers each got 40 yuan. Did this happen?" Kong replied, "No. The incident was because I had a quarrel with Zhou Zhonghua last year over debt collection, which led to a fight. We both went to the headquarters, so we had a grudge. I am now being falsely accused. The confession at the police station was given involuntarily and untruthfully." Zhang Guomin also testified that he was an official in the municipal party headquarters and denied being the deputy commander or murdering Wang Abao. After verifying the confessions, Magistrate Wu stated that the</p>
<p>Case still required further investigation and ordered the four defendants to be remanded in custody for further questioning on the morning of July 2nd.</p>
<h3>Suspicious Hanging Corpse</h3>
<p>Four feet off the ground.</p>
<p>Blood on forehead and flower in the ear.</p>
<p>Residents of Donggou Town gossip.</p>
<p>Planned murder?</p>
<p>A man was found hanging from a tree in the wasteland along the Donggou River in Pudong. The situation was reported in yesterday's newspaper. Wang Chongshan, the chief of the Third District's Fifth Precinct, investigated and found that the residents of the town said the deceased was a worker at the Donggou Match Factory and was from Shaoxing. A Mr. Lu stated that he was returning home late at night with a lantern and saw three people talking. One said, "This person is really honest; don't harm him." Another said, "He must die." Lu shone the lantern on them and was punched. Lu fled in terror. It was also found that the deceased was four feet off the ground, there were drops of blood on his forehead, and a pearl flower was in his right ear. All of these facts were strange. An inquiry was made with the match factory, but they denied having such an employee. It became a suspicious case. For a time, the residents of Donggou Town were in an uproar. Until yesterday, when prosecutors from the local court arrived and verified that the deceased had indeed hanged himself. The bloodstains on his forehead appeared to be caused by a hole the size of a bean, as if he had climbed the tree and been poked by a branch. The flower was replaced with a piece of white paper. The bailiff collected the body and took photos, waiting for someone to claim it. However, the elderly residents of the town said that this was a planned murder, meaning that the talk led to the hanging. No matter what, it will be verified as a suicide by hanging to avoid criminal liability unless the perpetrators are caught, in which case the truth can be revealed.</p>
<h3>Seafarers Mourn Mr. Thomas</h3>
<p>The Chinese Seamen's Union recently learned of the death of Mr. Thomas, Director of the International Labour Office, and sent a telegram of condolences to express their grief. The union received a reply from Geneva yesterday, which reads as follows: "The Bureau deeply appreciates your union's condolences for the irreparable loss. Mr. Thomas's death is an unspeakable loss to the Bureau. We have received numerous letters and telegrams of condolence from various parties. The Bureau should be encouraged to continue Mr. Thomas's work and thanks your union for its sincere condolences."</p>
<h3>Customs' Hai Xing Patrol Ship to be Launched on Schedule</h3>
<p>In light of the recent rampant piracy and the fear of merchants and travelers, the Shanghai Jianghai Customs entrusted the Jiangnan Shipyard with the construction of two patrol ships, named Hua Xing and Hai Xing, to strengthen the police force. The Hua Xing was launched at Gaochangmiao some time ago. Now, the Hai Xing is mostly completed and is scheduled to be launched at the same location on July 6th. It is said that Mrs. Mellor, wife of the Inspector General of Customs, will again perform the bottle-breaking ceremony. The ship has a displacement of 600 tons, a length of 148 feet, a width of 26 feet, a height of 13 feet, a draft of 10 feet, a speed of 12 knots per hour, and a price of approximately 1 million yuan. It has four cannons of various sizes and excellent weaponry.</p>
<h3>Public Security and Health Bureaus Pay Attention to Citizens' Summer Health</h3>
<p>Jointly issue a ban on the sale of unsanitary food and drinks. The Shanghai Municipal Public Security and Health Bureaus have jointly issued a proclamation regarding the ban on the sale of unsanitary food and drinks: "Proclamation: It has been found that the summer season is approaching and epidemics are prone to occur. All raw water and naturally-made ice, ice cream, shaved ice, sour plum soup, Dutch water jelly, and other foods and drinks are media for spreading disease. In order to prevent the breeding of epidemics and protect the health of citizens, the bureaus are strictly prohibiting the sale of all of the aforementioned unsanitary foods and drinks. All kinds of food and drinks sold in stalls, as well as cut fruits, must be covered with gauze. Otherwise, business is prohibited. If not complied with, severe punishment will be inflicted upon discovery. This proclamation is hereby issued."</p>
<h3>Rice Industry Asks for Delay in Adopting New Hu</h3>
<p>Changing the rice hu</p>
<p>Increases the burden.</p>
<p>The Shanghai rice industry has been using the Hai hu as the standard for selling rice. The difference between the Social Affairs Bureau's new hu and the Hai hu is 1.6 dou per shi (8.4 dou). But the Social Affairs Bureau has ordered the Bean and Rice Industry Association to switch to the new hu starting July 1st and notify the industry to comply. The North-South Rice Industry Association held a meeting and unanimously agreed that implementing the new hu would increase the burden on consumers. They have petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau to temporarily postpone the implementation. Various labor groups have learned of this and sent representatives to the leaders of the rice industry in the past two days, requesting that they not use the new hu. The leaders responded that they had already pleaded with the Social Affairs Bureau to be mindful of the difficulties of merchants and the people and to postpone the change.</p>
<h3>Case of Unauthorized Removal of Li Jishen's Home Electronics</h3>
<p>Heard once yesterday.</p>
<p>The intent is unclear.</p>
<p>Zhang Zhijie, a local resident, aged 18, along with Huang Axiang, Huang Minggao, Zhao Fugui, Ping Ade, and two others, hired two cars, numbers 08605 and 18242, on the afternoon of the 14th of this month. They trespassed into the residence of Central Committee Member Li Jishen at 3 Lane 163, Luban Road, in the French Concession, removed the installed wireless electronics, loaded them onto the cars, and hid them at Zhao Fugui's place on Jisi Fei'er Road. Before leaving, they made an appointment with Li's family to discuss the matter, hoping to extort money. The victim reported the matter to the police. Jin Jiulin, a detective inspector of the special organ, discovered that Zhang and others were hiding in Room 402 of the Oriental Hotel on Xizang Road. He, along with head detective Li Yaolong, deputy detective Qian Yumin, Zhang Ziying, and patrol detectives, went to the Oriental Hotel and arrested Zhang and the other five people, recovered the stolen goods, and brought them back to the police station, and sent them to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and investigation. Yesterday morning, Magistrate Li Changnian, along with clerk Wu Shan, came to the First Criminal Court to continue the hearing. Police lawyer Gu Shouxi first stated the facts of the case and prosecuted under Article 33</p>
<p>8, Paragraph 4 of the Criminal Law. Zhang Jie, on behalf of the plaintiff, stated the circumstances of the defendant's removal of the machine and requested the court to question the defendants about their backgrounds. Witness Lu Qinliang stated that he was a communications officer at Li's residence. On that day, I went to Li's residence at 2 p.m. to take over the shift and saw that the defendants had removed the machine. I asked them why they were removing it. The first defendant replied that it was illegal and carried it onto the car. Zhang Zhijie testified that Chen Guisheng had instructed him to move it. It was said that the purchase price had not been paid, so I asked Huang Minggao to invite the other defendants to remove it and store it at Zhao Fugui's place. They returned to the Oriental Hotel to wait for Chen Guisheng, who never showed up. The case was then investigated. Huang Axiang testified that he worked for Huang Minggao and that his master ordered him to go. Huang Minggao testified that he was a doctor. Zhang came to see him for medical treatment that day and asked me to find someone to move it. I asked Huang, Zhao, and Ping to go together. Zhang cut the wires and moved it. I didn't know that they were going to move the electronics. Zhao and Ping testified that they were friends with Huang Minggao and that Huang had asked them to go. The plaintiff's representative also stated that the machine was not purchased in Shanghai. It was moved from the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing and installed in Shanghai. Defendant One was defended by lawyer Wang Shizong. Magistrate Li verified the confession and ordered that the hearing be adjourned for further investigation. The defendants were remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Residents of Zhabei Youyu Lane Oppose Landlord's Forced Registration</h3>
<p>All the tenants of Youyu Lane on Zhabei Gonghe Road moved out during the Shanghai Incident. They only returned on May 16, when the Japanese troops withdrew. It has only been a month since then. The landlord, Fuyu Company, disregarding the tenants' difficulties, hired lawyer Chen Jinrong to issue proclamations stating that the landlord would voluntarily waive two, three, or four months of rent, provided that everyone registered and paid all outstanding rent at the same time. Otherwise, it would be considered a cancellation of the lease. The tenants of the lane, due to the evacuation, had no money to pay the outstanding rent and were long-time tenants, so it seemed unnecessary to register. Therefore, they did not register or pay the outstanding rent. On the 6th of this month, the landlord threatened that the houses would be renovated and ordered everyone to move out within the month. The tenants of the lane sent four representatives to Fuyu Company, the landlord, on Mengdelan Road, to petition manager Yu Jingfu, asking him to sympathize with the people's difficulties, cancel the renovation and demand for outstanding rent, and reduce the rent. However, the manager not only refused their request but also proposed three conditions: (1) The tenants must pay for the drawing fees (approximately 300 yuan). (2) The rent for May and June must be paid by the end of this month, along with one-third of the outstanding rent. (3) In July and August, in addition to paying the original rent, the outstanding rent must be paid in full. If they did not agree, the houses would be renovated. The representatives believed that the manager was obviously threatening them and obstructing them, so yesterday afternoon, they sent two representatives to the Municipal Rent Reduction Association to request assistance and to apply to join the association as members. After the Rent Reduction Association made detailed inquiries, it seemed that the landlord was oppressing them, so it agreed to their request and submitted it to the association's discussion yesterday and the special meeting of the delegates' meeting today for discussion. They will then submit it to today's delegates' meeting for a decision, providing as much assistance as possible.</p>
<h3>Special News from the Shipping Industry</h3>
<p>Naval ship worker falls into the water. The Jianghai Customs patrol ship Hai Xing was patrolling outside Wusong this time and returned to Shanghai, docking at the Lujiazui Wharf to unload cargo. It was Thursday morning at 9:00 a.m. Worker He Chun was working on the ship when the hoisting rope broke and He Chun fell into the river. The crew of the Hai Xing tried to recover the body but failed. As of yesterday, it had not been found and was presumed drowned. The ship has reported to the customs for compensation.</p>
<p>News of a Riverboat Encounter. Yesterday, the Shanghai shipping industry reported that the Sanbei Company's Yangtze River boat Songpu was transferred to Nanjing by the Ministry of Military Affairs the day before to transport bandit suppression troops to Jiujiang, Hankou, etc. Yesterday, news came that the Songpu boat had run aground en route due to the river level falling. It is now being towed and will be able to leave the shallows when the tide rises. Inquiries to the company did not yield detailed reports. Also, the company's Xing Shi boat was attacked by bandits downstream of Shashi. The troops stationed on the boat resisted but were no match. As a result, hundreds of bags of salt were looted and one passenger was killed. The ship has now arrived in Shashi.</p>
<p>Upstream sends ship to protect navigation. The upper reaches of the Yangtze River, in the Chenglinji area, are entirely bandit strongholds. Merchant ships passing through the area are often robbed. Merchant ships now fly foreign merchant flags. The Second Team of the Yangtze River Navy has also sent ships from Hankou to the upper reaches of Yuezhou Chenglinji to provide escort.</p>
<h3>Verdict in the Case of Tong Tai Yong against the Insurance Company</h3>
<p>19th Route Army Denies Guerrilla Warfare. Tong Tai Yong, a canned food store on Xihuaide Road in Hongkou, was suddenly engulfed in flames on February 2, during the height of the Sino-Japanese war. The store had insured its fire insurance for 10,000 taels of silver with the Hequn Business Company, so it immediately sought compensation. Hequn initially claimed that they were only an agency and that the insurance was underwritten by the German company Selexia, and that they should negotiate with that company. Chen Lianghuai, the manager of Tong Tai Yong, argued that Hequn had not made this statement at the time of the guarantee, which was a pretext to evade liability. He hired lawyer Lin Jieqing to sue the First Special District Court. Hequn also hired lawyer Shen Yuesheng to defend the suit. In addition to pointing out that the subject of the lawsuit was wrong and that they should negotiate with Selexia's Shanghai agent, they also based their defense on a letter from the Japanese Consulate, stating that Chinese guerrillas had attacked Japanese troops at that time and place, so Japanese soldiers had opened fire in retaliation, causing the store to catch fire and be destroyed. In this case, the plaintiff's insurance was not for war risks, so they were not liable for compensation. In order to clarify the cause of the fire, the plaintiff's lawyer sent a letter to the headquarters of the 19th Route Army to investigate the battle situation on that day.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>The Army Headquarters replied, stating, in brief: "We have received a letter stating that Tong Tai Yong canned food store was suddenly burned down on February 2 of this year, resulting in tens of thousands of taels of silver in damages. However, according to the Japanese Consul in Shanghai, Chinese guerrillas fired on Japanese troops in the area on that day. Please provide detailed information to provide a basis for our investigation. It has been verified that the 19th Route Army did not have any guerrilla units during the anti-Japanese war in Shanghai. The statements made by the Japanese Consul are obviously fictitious and intended to evade responsibility. We have replied to the letter and hope that you will investigate and negotiate truthfully." Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xiao held a continued hearing on the case. Lawyer Lin presented the above letter as evidence. Then, Westerner Polayi of the Fire Brigade was called to testify about the firefighting process. He stated that the fire trucks stopped at the intersection of Wuchang Road and Miller Road, 20 to 30 yards from the fire. At the time, a Japanese officer said that Chinese guerrillas were firing from the roof of Tong Tai Yong, and the witness heard gunshots and saw bullet casings on the ground nearby. But it was impossible to determine whether the store was destroyed by guerrillas or by Japanese troops firing on guerrillas. Ge Ge, a fire expert at the Sanyi Foreign Company, testified that he was hired by Hequn Company to assess the damage after the incident. At that time, the Japanese troops had not withdrawn, and they said that the fire was caused by fighting with guerrillas. But he estimated the actual loss of the store to be about 3,900 taels of silver and discussed with Mr. Zheng that such fire losses were difficult for the insurer to bear. Subsequently, the lawyers for both parties debated and concluded the case. The judge ordered a recess and will announce the verdict at a later date.</p>
<h3>Yao Zhujiao Road Morphine Apparatus Case Verdict</h3>
<p>Zhao and Ou Sentenced to Three Years</p>
<p>Plus a Fine of Five Thousand Yuan</p>
<p>At No. 121 Yao Zhujiao Road, French Concession, on the third floor of a Western-style house, someone had privately set up a morphine drug manufacturing apparatus. This was discovered by detectives Lu Jinbao and Cao Fuchang of the Beidang Road Police Station. They reported to Western Inspector Lü Aicai (transliteration), who led a team of officers to search the premises around 2:00 AM on the 12th of this month. They seized two motorized machines and a large number of accessories, such as glass containers and rubber equipment, along with over 190 catties of finished and unfinished wet and dry raw drug powders. Five people were arrested on the spot: Hou Yunshan and Hou Liru, father and son from Guizhou; and Liu Mingzhang, Tu Hongfa, and Jin Yushan, cooks and laborers from Sichuan and Hubei. All five were taken to the police station for investigation. The next morning at 11:00 AM, Zhao Youming (previously mistakenly identified as being from Sichuan), residing at No. 448 Malang Road, and Ou Yongxiang, residing at No. 4, Lane 169, Lüban Road, both from Sichuan, went to the French General Police Station to see Western Inspector Sa Cai'er (transliteration). Zhao claimed that he had rented the house and sublet it to Wang Hanzhang, who had privately set up the manufacturing of prohibited items. He wanted to intervene to avoid prosecution and secure the release of the detainees. After the Western Inspector reported to the General Inspector, Zhao and Ou were detained and sent to the Second Special District Court for prosecution under Article 6 of the Anti-Smoking Law. Judge Xiong Huiping presided over the trial. The defendants hired lawyers Xu Yannian and Zhao Zuwei to defend them. After the trial, a verdict date was set. Subsequently, the trial judge discovered that the case also involved a car registered under Zhao Youming's name, and that the third defendant, Hou Yunshan, had acted as a bookkeeper, among other suspicious circumstances. Therefore, a retrial was specifically ordered. The retrial took place on the afternoon of the 23rd, focusing on the suspicious points. After the retrial, the debate was declared closed, and the case was submitted for judgment. Yesterday, the verdict was announced. The defendants' lawyers arrived at the court successively after 2:00 PM to await the judgment. At 3:30 PM, Judge Xiong, accompanied by clerk Tao Zongkan, took their seats in the first criminal court and ordered the defendants to be brought to court. After briefly questioning their ages, origins, and occupations, the verdict was announced. The main points were: Zhao Youming (also known as Pi Cheng and Hong Qing) and Ou Shuixiang (also known as Xi Cheng) were each sentenced to three years imprisonment and fined fifty yuan for the crime of jointly manufacturing opium substitutes. Hou Yunshan was sentenced to one year imprisonment and fined four thousand yuan for the crime of directly and significantly assisting in the manufacture of opium substitutes. Liu Mingzhang, Hou Lihe, Tu Hongfa, and Jin Yushan were each sentenced to one year imprisonment and fined two thousand four hundred yuan for the crime of assisting in the manufacture of opium substitutes. If the fines were converted to imprisonment, the total amount would be calculated proportionally to the number of days in a year. The number of days in pretrial detention would be credited at a rate of two days for one day of imprisonment. Zhao's defense lawyer, Xu Yannian, requested that the defendant be allowed bail during the appeal period to find the main offender, Wang Hanzhang, and bring him to justice. Ou's defense lawyer, Zhao Zuwei, also requested that his client be granted bail during the appeal period to await instructions. The court also ordered Zhao Youming and Ou Yongxiang to each pay a bail of 50,000 yuan during the appeal period to suspend their detention.</p>
<h3>Bankruptcy Declaration Case Verdict</h3>
<p>Defendant Not Guilty: Plaintiff Sentenced to Imprisonment</p>
<p>Zhen Tai Dyeing Shop on Mindeli Road, Hanjian Bridge, Zhabei, was jointly established by Li Shande and others. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the shop was located in the war zone, and the business premises were burned down. Li and others fled in panic, barely escaping with their lives. Later, due to the national crisis, they were unable to maintain the business and entrusted lawyer Zhou Xiao'an to declare bankruptcy. However, creditors Xia Shouqing of Zikang Pigment Company and Zhang Yongfu of Xianchangyong Pigment Company suddenly hired lawyer Yu Hualong to sue Li Shande in the criminal division of the Shanghai Second Special District Court for criminal fraud, and attached a civil suit to recover the debt. Li still hired lawyer Zhou Xiao'an to defend him in court, and filed a counterclaim against Xia Shouqing and others, requesting that they be prosecuted for false accusation. The lawyers on both sides debated fiercely. Yesterday, the court announced its verdict. The main points were: defendant Li Shande was found not guilty. Xia Shouqing and Zhang Yongfu were each sentenced to two months imprisonment, suspended for two years, for the crime of joint false accusation. The attached civil suit was dismissed.</p>
<h3>Nephew Sues Maternal Uncle for Encroaching on Inheritance</h3>
<p>Request for Assistance from Anhui Fellow-Provincials Society Jiang Xizhi, from Anhui, is the son of the late Jiang Huanan, former magistrate of Gaochun County, Jiangsu and Changde County, Hunan. His father had considerable savings during his lifetime and owned properties in Shanghai at No. 439 Bubai Road, Donghai Fang on Jiaxiyi Road, and various locations in Zhenjiang, as well as shares in the Qifangge Tea House in Nanjing, with a total value of over 200,000 yuan. Xizhi has seven siblings. The first, second, and third sisters were already married, and the fourth sister is still unmarried in Fujian. Their father passed away in 1927, and all the inheritance was taken over by Jiang Xizhi alone. Recently, his second sister, Zhu Jiangshi, believing that women have the right to inherit property, specifically sent her son, Zhu Yunfei, to Shanghai to negotiate with Jiang Xizhi about dividing the property. However, Jiang dismissed him and even insulted him. Zhu then hired lawyer Li Ming to sue Jiang in the Second Special District Court for malicious encroachment, demanding a share of 30,000 yuan of the inheritance. The court held a hearing at 9:00 AM on the 20th of this month. The defendant hired lawyer Wang Shizong to defend him. First, the plaintiff, Zhu Yunfei, testified about the circumstances of the encroachment. When questioned by the defendant, he claimed that the family property could be divided equally, but it was not as much as 200,000 yuan. The court adjourned the hearing to the 27th of this month to investigate the evidence of the defendant's property. Zhu, unfamiliar with the people and places in Shanghai, has sent a letter to the Anhui Fellow-Provincials Society for assistance.</p>
<h3>Coveting a Young Woman, Giving Money for Treatment</h3>
<p>Causing Marital Disputes Li Yaogen, a native of Zhenjiang, who lives at No. 128 Kongjia Lane, owns a western goods shop. He has a single daughter named Meilan, who is twenty years old. She had been betrothed to a Gao family, but the marriage was dissolved because the Gao son was not engaged in proper business. Unexpectedly, Meilan became ill with resentment. Her father had lost his job and lacked money for treatment. A neighbor, Ren Shouting, a forty-six-year-old from Henan, who already has a wife and two concubines, saw that Meilan was beautiful and had the idea of pursuing her. Knowing that Meilan was sick, he asked a tailor to bring 100 yuan to Li Yaogen to pay for his daughter's treatment. Li was afraid to accept it, but the tailor said that this was a charitable act by the great philanthropist Ren Shouting and did not need to be repaid. When Meilan recovered, Ren Shouting came to visit and eventually talked about marriage, wanting to marry Meilan as his wife. The tailor exaggerated Ren's wealth, claiming that he was a rich man. However, Meilan knew that Ren already had three wives and refused to marry him, politely declining. She was later betrothed to a Feng family and has already married. Unexpectedly, Ren Shouting secretly instructed Meilan to go to the Feng family a month ago, accusing Meilan of breach of promise and fraudulently obtaining money, demanding the return of the loan and engagement money totaling 3,000 yuan. Feng brought Ren to the Laozha Police Station for investigation. After questioning, the police chief determined that the case was related to marriage and instructed them to file a lawsuit in court. Unexpectedly, at 6:00 PM yesterday, Ren Shouting went to Li Yaogen's house to argue. Police officer Peng Yifeng brought Li and Ren to the First Branch of the Second District. After questioning, Director Xu recorded Ren Shouting's statement that he had engaged the defendant's daughter Meilan through a matchmaker in January of last year, but the defendant had secretly betrothed his daughter to someone else, committing fraud. Li Yaogen and his wife, Ruan, stated that the plaintiff was attempting to induce marriage, falsely claiming to donate money for treatment and claiming to be charitable, but in reality, he was coveting their daughter. The so-called engagement was without their daughter's consent, and their daughter had already expressed her unwillingness and was freely betrothed to a Feng family.

<h3>Lamenting Wusong in the Rain</h3>
<p>— Cha Yiqing</p>
<p>I have been serving at the Wusong Coast Radio Station. Since escaping from the January 28th Incident, I have been staying in the concession for over four months. Yesterday, I went with a friend to lament Wusong. It happened to be during the continuous plum rain. The desolation filled the eyes. The radio station that once stood straight into the clouds had been bombed and destroyed. Tracing the battle, I couldn't help but feel moved. So I wrote four quatrains to share with the readers. The flames of war opened without warning, leaving only the sorrow of burnt gardens. On the misty, plum-rainy Wusong Road, the towering radio station is no longer seen. The winding path is desolate and the scenery is dim. The broken walls and ruins are all heartbreaking. It is difficult to recognize the old place. Everywhere, only bullet marks remain. Reluctantly tracing the battlefield, the three armies fought heroically to kill the enemy. The courage of ten thousand Japanese invaders was shattered. Their heroic deeds will be remembered for a thousand springs. Coming to lament, a hundred sorrows arise. Tears fill my blue shirt, unable to bear the sight. Leaving a few withered willows, they seem to be telling a story of parting in the rain.</p>

<h3>Methods of Water Purification</h3>
<p>— Yun Li</p>
<p>Whether water is clean or not has a great impact on people's lives. Ordinary water mostly contains unclean impurities. It is unsanitary and very dangerous to life to use it as drinking water without purifying it. Therefore, if we want to drink clean water, we must go through one of the following four methods before we can have clean water to drink.</p>
<p>(1) Coagulation Treatment: Grind alum into a fine powder, put it into sewage, stir it evenly to dissolve it, and it will produce a gelatinous substance that combines with mud, sand, microorganisms, and all unclean impurities in the water, settling to the bottom. After two or three hours, the water will be clean and can be used as drinking water. This method is very simple and costs only one or two copper coins. Families without tap water can mostly use this method for drinking water. However, alum tastes astringent, and the amount should not be too much!</p>
<p>(2) Filtration: Use a pottery jar or flower pot with a hole in the bottom. Plug a sponge in the hole. Then spread a layer of charcoal chips more than an inch thick on the bottom, a layer of gravel more than an inch thick on the charcoal chips, and a layer of fine sand more than an inch thick on the gravel. Spread it in this way for several layers, and the water filter will be completed. Then pour the sewage into the jar, and in a short while, clean water will flow out from the hole in the bottom of the jar. However, the charcoal chips, fine sand, gravel, etc. in this water filter must be changed or washed frequently to prevent unclean substances and microorganisms from remaining inside.</p>
<p>(3) Boiling: Put the water in a pot and boil it for 15 minutes, or until the temperature reaches above 90 degrees Celsius, and the water will boil. The microorganisms in the water will not be able to survive. If this water is used as drinking water, there is no risk of causing disease. Therefore, families that want to reduce disease must implement this method for drinking water.</p>
<p>The above methods 1 and 2 can only remove mud and sand impurities from the water, but cannot kill the microorganisms in the water. Method 3 can only kill microorganisms, but cannot remove mud and sand. If methods 1 and 3 are used together, or methods 2 and 3 are used together, to make daily drinking water, it is very suitable. However, impurities dissolved in the water cannot be completely removed, which is indeed a common shortcoming. If you want to avoid this shortcoming and drink pure, clean water, you must use distillation.</p>
<p>(4) Distillation: Use a glass bottle with water filling three-fifths of the bottle. Plug the bottle mouth with a cork, and insert a curved glass tube in the middle of the cork, with one end longer and one end shorter. Next, insert the short end of the tube into the bottle, but be careful not to insert it into the bottom of the water. Extend the longer end outside the bottle. Again, put a bamboo tube on the longer end of the glass tube, and keep cold water flowing through this bamboo tube. Then put a basin under the long glass tube, and then heat the glass bottle from below with fire. When the water in the bottle boils, the steam will flow out from the glass tube and turn into water when it meets the cold in the bamboo tube, flowing into the basin. This water is distilled water. However, the cold water in the bamboo tube must be changed frequently to prevent it from becoming hot, because if it becomes hot, it will not be able to condense the steam into water. This distilled water is very hygienic. It is now used in hospitals and in the preparation of chemical medicines.</p>
<h3>The End of the Classical Chinese Course</h3>
<p>— Zhuo Jun</p>
<p>Since the abolition of the imperial examination system, private tutors have transformed into schools, allowing the academic world to conduct free research without being restricted by the poison of the eight-legged essay, which is a major liberation for education in our country.</p>
<p>However, what I want to talk about is the impression of the Classical Chinese course at a certain university in Shanghai and the psychology of the students.</p>
<p>The class bell rang, and many students in the classroom craned their necks and looked towards the classroom door, anticipating the arrival of the Classical Chinese professor, as it was the first Classical Chinese class after the start of the semester. As for the professor's name, many didn't know, so everyone wanted to catch a glimpse of the professor's demeanor and arrived very early today, almost to the point of overcrowding. Some students who arrived late were left standing outside the classroom window.</p>
<p>"Don't know what the surname of this teacher is?" a student nicknamed "Big Guy" asked Wang, who was sitting next to him.</p>
<p>"Heard it's Wang!" Wang replied uncertainly.</p>
<p>Before long, the Classical Chinese professor with long hair strode into the classroom, smiling at the students and saying, "Please bring your course cards for signing!" After he said this, the students swarmed forward, vying for the professor's signature, but the professor had no choice but to say, "Hand them in slowly, there's still time."</p>
<p>"Humph, this teacher doesn't seem fierce!" Big Guy said to the students.</p>
<p>"We don't have to attend classes in the future, it doesn't matter," Chen replied, seemingly echoing Big Guy's tone.</p>
<p>Sure enough, a week passed. Whenever it was time for the Classical Chinese class, the classroom was always very deserted. Apart from a few dozen more honest students in their seats, the rest were unwilling to attend the Classical Chinese class. They preferred to sleep or chat in their dormitories.</p>
<p>In dormitory number 38, Big Guy's voice spread to Wang's dormitory next door. The following is Big Guy's discussion: "Why should I study it (Classical Chinese)? It's just for these few credits; if it weren't for these few credits, I really wouldn't want to study it; we college students really don't need to study Classical Chinese; and since I'm studying banking, I need it even less."</p>
<p>This content was unintentionally mentioned in a conversation between my close friend Wang and me. I felt it was necessary to publish it so that readers could understand that the Classical Chinese course in universities today is merely a formality without substance. The so-called end is near. I wonder what kind of feelings the old scholars will have after reading this, or will they call it "the demise of civilization"!</p>

<h3>Thoughts After Reading "Attention Telephone Owners"</h3>
<p>— Yiyi Guan Zhu</p>
<p>The day before yesterday (the 22nd), this newspaper's local news section published a novel news item with the title "Attention Telephone Owners," which stated:</p>
<p>"Recently, there has been a Chinese person between the ages of twenty-eight and thirty, about five feet seven inches tall, of medium build, with a slightly dark and round face, large and round eyes, short hair, wearing a blue cloth short jacket and pants, and a checkered cap. He can speak fluent English and specializes in going to various homes or business establishments to swindle for telephones..."</p>
<p>After reading the above news, the following thoughts arose:</p>
<p>I feel that in recent years, the number of unemployed people in society has been increasing. On the one hand, school graduates and returned students are emerging in endless streams, while on the other hand, all industries are withering, production is lagging behind, and all kinds of undertakings are stagnating. Naturally, there are not enough places to employ these batches of school graduates and returned students, and it is even more difficult for so many unemployed people to find employment. Therefore, the strong take risks, and the weak become pessimistic or have wild ideas, engaging in various kinds of deceptive activities, such as the swindler who specializes in defrauding people of their telephones. Could he not be one of them? Although his attire resembles that of a worker, since he can speak fluent English, we assume that even if he is not a returned student, he must be a graduate of some school. I believe that this kind of swindler should not only be paid attention to by telephone owners, but also by important figures in society.</p>

<h3>Standing Guard</h3>
<p>— Tan Zhuoming</p>
<p>This is the XX Company's warehouse! A three-story "Shanghai-style" house, with goods piled up on the second floor and downstairs, and the third floor used as a dormitory for the staff. The kitchen downstairs is designated as the office and residence of the warehouse manager L. The room contains only a square table and a board bed, the furnishings are very simple. Because of the water pipes on the wall, the ground is very damp, and it is covered with thick phlegm, so it is wet and sticky. It is dusk, and five or six people are distributed on the board bed and around the table. Several people are smoking cigarettes, and wisps of white smoke spew out from everyone's mouths, enveloping the room in a thick white mist.</p>
<p>"Going out to have fun?" L asked strangely, seeing that they hadn't gone out these past few days.</p>
<p>"Ugh! Where is there to go? Anlewo (entertainment venue) is closed, Liyuan Company is closed, the area around the Great World is as desolate as death, who would be happy to go out?" B sighed deeply.</p>
<p>"Let's do it ourselves, mahjong, poker, whatever you like," T, a poker expert, proposed at the opportunity.</p>
<p>"No, it's too dangerous, what if the boss sees it? It won't be good for anyone," L vehemently objected because he was responsible for the security here.</p>
<p>"Find someone to stand guard."</p>
<p>"Idiot, how can you transmit messages across two floors?"</p>
<p>"Ugh: : :"</p>
<p>Everyone felt that there was no way to "stand guard," a look of disappointment on their faces, and remained silent. The room was silent.</p>
<p>K is the accountant of this company, very clever and resourceful. The boss trusts him very much. He likes to drink, but he is not very willing to spend his own money to buy it. If his colleagues have something to ask him to solve, they only need to treat him to a meal, and he will gladly help. Over time, it has become a kind of trade. Now, seeing that the opportunity has come, he frowned, scratched his hair, and asked for a meal as the price. After a while, he smiled slightly and said:</p>
<p>"If you can treat me to a meal, I'll give you a very good "guarding method."</p>
<p>Everyone's eyes focused on K's face. K smiled and said nothing. T knew this was his old habit, reached into his pocket, took out two silver dollars, and slammed them on the table with a "bang"!</p>
<p>"Tell me, if it's applicable, this is the reward."</p>
<p>"This method is very easy. Tomorrow, I'll tell the boss: "The people in the dormitory are too lazy, and they often forget to turn off the lights when they go to bed. It's best to install the electricity meter in L's room and have L be responsible for turning it on and off every night. I think the boss will definitely agree. The matter will be successful. When the boss comes, just turn the electricity meter a few times, won't the lights upstairs flicker?"</p>
<p>"Great plan, let's go, let's go drink a big cup," T took the two silver dollars on the table and left first, with everyone cheering and following him out of the room.</p>
<p>From then on, the boss often praised his employees to others, saying:</p>
<p>"Every time I go to the dormitory to inspect, all the employees are reading or writing."</p>

<h3>New Invention of the Chinese People</h3>
<p>— Yu Jianhua</p>
<p>Since ancient times, the Chinese people have invented countless good things. Now, the ability to invent is even more developed, especially our government authorities, who are almost racking their brains every day to come up with new ideas. They are truly worthy of being the Edisons of the East.</p>
<p>Last year, our young marshal invented "non-resistance," and lightly gave away the three northeastern provinces. This year, the old comrades invented "long-term resistance," and almost lightly gave away Songhu.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Shanghai Incident, they invented "not losing an inch of land," but later found that it was not enough, so they invented "strategic retreat, to the second line of defense." Our "national light" initially invented "vowing to defend the country," and later invented "preserving strength," then invented "acting insincerely," then invented "vowing to fight to the death," and now they are probably inventing "gathering for a counterattack."</p>
<p>After the government abolished the likin (internal transit tax), it then invented the "business tax." Now, because it cannot collect the national taxes from the three northeastern provinces and Guangdong and Guangxi, the clever uncle is about to invent some kind of "new tax" in addition to miscellaneous levies and taxes.</p>
<p>After already banning opium, they invented "imposing a tax in the guise of prohibition," and now they have invented "government monopoly." Just as the X Concession was about to ban opium, someone had already invented a "security company" to contract and seize contributions.</p>
<p>With so many inventors and such wonderful inventions, in just a few years, why worry that China will not become a first-class power?</p>

<h3>An Inhuman Act of Violence</h3>
<p>— Shi Ben</p>
<p>Last month, Mr. Leshan's article (A Maid's Confession) in this publication already fully revealed the suffering of maids in the world. But now, there is an even worse case of abuse than others, which I have personally witnessed and heard about. I am writing to this publication to show that this inhuman behavior actually exists in this era that sings the praises of humanitarianism and claims to be civilized.</p>
<p>In our town, there is a wealthy household. The master is an old man over seventy years old. Although this old man is so old, his spirit is better than that of us young people. His skin is smooth and ruddy, and he doesn't walk with any signs of old age. The neighbors, seeing that he is so hale and hearty, all went to ask him the secret of his health, but strangely, no matter how they asked, he always refused to reveal his secret to good health. Some suspected that he was taking tonics such as ginseng and bird's nest. Originally, people like this who were rich and powerful naturally had enough ginseng and bird's nest to eat constantly. Therefore, others, seeing that he was unwilling to reveal the reason, stopped asking and firmly believed in the effectiveness of his taking ginseng and bird's nest. But I had some doubts, thinking that since he had gained effectiveness from taking ginseng and bird's nest, then this was a legitimate health technique, and there was definitely no hidden secret. One day, it happened that one of his maids came to my house to borrow something, so I inquired with her. She said: This old man has a strange temperament and likes to buy young maids. There are often more than a dozen in his house. These young maids are bought not for work, but entirely for his personal health. He uses one of the maids every night and gives her a black date every night. When dawn comes (please excuse me for not explaining this here), he steams the black date and eats it. He has been doing this every day for more than ten years. After being subjected to this treatment, these maids gradually lose their essence, become sallow and emaciated, and most of them die within two or three years. Alas! Over the past ten years, he has killed quite a few people!</p>
<p>Oh dear! After listening to her words, I couldn't help but feel my hair stand on end. No wonder he is so healthy and can't say why he is so healthy. It turns out that he is using this inhuman method of harming others to benefit himself, like a demon extracting human essence. Alas! His life is not maintained by "vitamins," but simply by harming her life to "vitaminize" him.</p>
