<h3>西班牙代表從法理立言</h3>
<p>日本罔顧國際法紀</p>
<p>國聯遷延自召滅亡</p>
<p>（日内瓦）國聯會非常大會七日上午十一時開會、由此國外長希孟主席本日會議　賡續關於中日爭端之一般的討論、西班牙代表馬達里加發表演說、謂渠承認中日爭端複雜艱難、此項爭端乃國家的理性與國際的理性相衝突、而此國際的理性對於日本國民未必不發生嚴重之影響、西班牙代表對於國聯會加以稱頌謂國聯會當满洲事變發生時、爲之大驚、爰乃採取審愼賢明而又忍耐之行動、渠又謂每問題、若以善意圖謀解决則程序雖遲緩亦屬無妨、大會與國聯會之任務在終止敵對行爲、而爲爭端覓一解决方案、又在宣揚國聯會所有之原則當其着手調解以前、國聯會宜先將其對於過去事變之意見、予以宣布以便調解易於進行蓋調解方案、必須有百之基礎與確定之立塲而後可、調解必須顧及國聯會之利益、國聯會設若放棄職責、必將自召滅亡調解亦必須顧及日本之利益蓋日本永久利益、實與國聯會之利益相符合也、馬達里加又謂、西班牙政府對於李頓調查國觀察所得及結論之主張、完全接受、西班牙代表作結論云、「永久之日本與歷史上之日本、當因此事獲一敎訓即至少就方式而論、吾人與目今之日本意見實不相同是也世界所需者係秩序、但秩序非戎裝或士兵之謂所謂秩序不、外規則與法理而已、」又云「吾人當主張法理、信仰法理并認定法理云云馬達利加演說畢、主席乃請瑞士代表穆塔發言（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>瑞士代表爲道德說法</h3>
<p>瑞士代表穆塔繼起發言、采聲雷動穆氏謂渠不欲揚聲誹議爭執中牽涉兩大國之任何一國、蓋兩國均與瑞士維持至　好之關係也、渠今僅欲發言維護國聯盟約、行政院將本案移交大會、其目的乃欲使各會員對爭案與李頓報吿書自由發表意見、李頓報吿書乃絕好文件、足增撰稿人</p>
<p>與國聯之聲望、國聯在此間辯論後、將有何種步襄乎、以渠意見、應令十九特委會提出並監視一種和解手續、渠希望此事可成、庶避免適用盟約第十五條第四節之需要、日本之行爲、果爲合法自衛之行爲乎、李頓報吿書已有毫無疑義之答語、日本在施行其擴拓政策時、果有軍事征服之念乎、李頓報吿書於此亦有答語、苟無日兵、新邦不能成立、但調查團亦謂恢復原狀爲不可能矣、穆塔至此言及日人所稱不請求國聯援助之理由、謂日人理由、顧與第十條及第十二條相抵觸、任何國家不應任意進行、此乃世界和平成功之要素、吾人對於兩國皆有完全同情、吾人希望不獨在現有爭執上、並在各問題上有友誼的解决、總之日本已越出其權利之外、如日本接受國聯之權威、則實有增其榮譽、而對於道德的力量、與天良之尊嚴、大有裨補也云云、（路透電）</p>
<h3>希臘代表借題發牢騷</h3>
<p>希臘代表波立狄斯於采聲中繼起發言謂今晨聆諸人言論後、渠不願多所　述、國聯已解决滬案、聲望因之增高、現尙有東三省事尙待解决較之滬案、難良懸殊、幸李頓報吿書對此時局、示以南針故此書乃覓取最後出路之工具、今在大會前之主要問題、爲合　自衛問題、自衛乃任何國家應有之權、受危害時應採行保護自已之立即計畫、日人所謂合法自衛　從國際公法點研究之、李頓報吿書關於此點、言之綦詳、日本苟不能提出證據以推翻之、則李頓報吿書當然支配大會之决議、波氏言至此、追述一九二五年處理希布兩國爭執之舊案、當時希臘接受行政院之决議、而允付賠欵也日本在此爭議中、誠受有挑　行爲如片面廢約排貨等事、但此種危險果屬眞正巨大、而使日本可無須請國聯干涉乎、松岡雖提出日本不請求國聯辦理之理由、惟渠覺日本至少應試騐國聯干涉能力、渠對於日本意志與信仰之誠摰、不欲有所疑問但渠以爲大會責任所在、不可不聲明日本理論之乖謬、故時局仍有希望地步、渠信大會仍可覓取友好解决之基礎、而免去採用第十五條第四節之必要云云、（路透社）</p>
<p>中美瓜地瑪拉代表馬都於波立狄斯演說後發言、謂小國對於中日爭議之焦慮、乃因其牽涉原則而起渠所代表之政府贊助國聯盟約所含之原則、並認李頓報吿書應爲國聯各種行動之根據、渠準備竭其能力、擁護李頓報吿書、瓜政府主張條約之尊重云云、</p>
<p>馬氏言畢大會乃宣布延會定今午三時半續會、</p>
<h3>法代表彭古演詞欠明晰</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）國聯大會今日午後三時四十分續開會議、首由烏魯圭代表布羅博士發言、略謂渠發言之目的、在援助國聯所有之權力、渠贊成設立一種委員會、研究覔取解决爭端之方法云、</p>
<p>法代表彭古繼起發言、謂國聯易受人指摘、有人以爲辦事迂緩、適用於遠東爭　者、亦可適用於將來歐洲衝突、持此見解者、在此爭執中將覺其錯誤、情勢異乎尋常、吾人必不可忘者、爭執中兩造之一、有權在其他一國駐紮軍隊、法國在國聯之中、願參加凡可恢復和平之任何計畫一年前即十二月十日、國聯於白里安主席之下曾通過一議案、而成盟約之基本原則並附有一種宣言、不獨爲行政院所通過、且亦爲兩造所承認、於是調查團乃吿成立、今其報吿書刻方在考慮中、此報吿書分爲兩部、一爲認識與視察、一爲結論與建議、爲吾人利益計、吾人工作應基於此種認識與建議在大會之前、有兩個階叚、一爲調和、關於此節、渠覺應先表示最小之基礎、俾調和之程序得不越出其範圍、一爲將來或須有依照第十五條第四節辦理之必要、渠以爲報吿書已表示最好方法、於此可適用一種調和程序、即雙方直接討論是也、目前已有之辯論、尙未表明雙方對於李頓報吿書結論之感想、渠以爲必要者各點須分别有密切詳細之討論、此爲初步的調和程序所不可少者云云、彭古演詞殊欠明晰、頗爲人所抨擊、英外相西門繼彭古發言、文中屢、言盟約第十五條第四節、茲錄原文如下、倘爭議不能如此解决、則行政院經全體或多數之表决、應繕發報吿書說明爭議之事實、及行政院所認爲不允適當之建議</p>
<h3>前日開會情形</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）國聯大會特别會議六日下午三時四十五分續開會議後、愛爾蘭代表高諾利·瑞典代表恩頓·捷克斯拉夫外長彭納斯等、依次發表意見如下、</p>
<h3>南愛代表大聲疾呼國聯如畏葸不前本身將無以圖存</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）國聯大會今日午後繼續開會時、愛爾蘭代表高諾利首先發言、謂李頓報吿書及大會對此所可採行之行動、不僅關係中日兩國、且亦關係國聯本身之前途、遠東和戰之大問題及其在世界和平上之必有的影響、皆與對　報吿書之决議實相維繫、渠之言此實非侈談、大會必須根據事實、下以公平判斷、並謀取對有關係各方面一律平等之解决法、而消滅此種衝突、及其將來讐敵之可能性、許多批評家認國聯無能力以處理重大問題、渠與愛爾蘭之許多人士亦曾抱此見解、但渠到日内瓦以來、渠始覺國聯在其憲法中、有維護世界和平之極　權力、不過須國聯準備切實的勇敢的保障國聯盟約、及其自已决議如退縮不前、或有所顧忌、而以開罪於人爲慮則國聯不能生存、且亦不値得生存也李頓報吿書發現若干表徵爲大會所當注意者其最顯著者、報吿書似已表明日本爲謀取其利益計、施用帝國主義之膨脹方法絕不顧及傷害另一主權國之領土權、事有不可置辯者、日本設立並維持「滿洲國」之活動不可忽視、世人所抱日本官員終將完全管理「滿洲國」之慮、並非毫無理由、報吿書顯已說明日本確有侵犯國聯盟約非戰公約與九國公約之舉動、因此侵犯舉動、而「滿洲國」遂吿成立、李頓報吿書之斷論中、有恢復原狀無以解决難題、而維持與承認「滿州國」亦非美滿辦法、因其不顧及滿洲人民之志願、且與日本之最後利益是否有益亦屬可疑也等語、據渠觀之、此節實爲時局中之扼要點、而是否有益於日本最後利益一語、尤屬重要、日本在滿洲有切實利益、固爲人承認、而必予以相當之顧慮、但此種利益、以和平方法保護之、實較施用武力、可更鞏固、渠希望大會意見與渠相同、並希望日本在思慮後、亦可予以同意、今李頓報吿書置於吾人之前、吾人苟不預備否認之斷論、　出席此會之各國、必須宣布其拒絕承認「滿洲國」之意思、假欲維持國聯之完整、則舍此而外、渠未見有其他辦法也、日本或謂日本以犧牲生命金錢、以鞏固其在滿洲之地位、查在世界「戰以弭戰」之戰爭中、喪失生命、不知幾百萬、耗費金錢、不知幾萬萬而其唯結果、徒使世界惶惑迷離、而處於社會經濟擾攘之狀况中耳、國聯即由此戰事而產生而其所維繫世界者、僅賴條約之一縷、吾人必不可容人切晰此　縷也、小國極所注意者、國聯盟約之原則、必須穩固維持、如國聯之道德上力量、在此爭點上、竟歸破裂、則現有之國聯安能生存、李整報吿書表示一種意思、以爲滿洲境、内設立地方警憲隊或可爲最後解决之根據、此點亦可注意、日本須知苟堅持其現有態度、將使日本爲人輕視、日本苟拒絕適合國聯盟約之條件、則將喪失好意與商業關係、但國聯大會之責任、即以任何代價、維持必須適用盟約之辦法者、並不因以减少、此種見解、苟日本人民難以了解、則誠屬可　、愛爾蘭自由邦極反對帝國主義膨脹之思想、渠覺大會應切實接受李頓報吿書、渠代表南愛政府毫無猶豫的接受之、就愛爾蘭自由邦而言、渠將採用李頓調查團之建議、拒絕承認在滿洲所有、狀態下而成立之新國、南愛旣已切實作此宣言、尙願出其所可能之助力、謀取以李頓報吿書爲根據之解决辦法云云</p>
<h3>捷克外長滔滔雄辯</h3>
<p>竭誠擁護國聯盟約尊嚴</p>
<p>維護和平對日不容寛怒</p>
<p>捷克外長彭納斯博士繼起演說、言及此問題之重要、謂自國聯成立以來、大會在盟約第十五條下被召行事、此爲第　次此爲最後而切實的解决之問題、或須涉及裁判辦法之適用、此問題關係全世界、查此問題所涉及之區域、其幅員　於法德兩國集合之面積、而其所涉及之國家、其人民超過地球他處居民之總數、且在政治上經濟上精神上涉及非國聯會員之其他兩大國、捷克國所注意者、純爲原則的關係、蓋捷克對於此案之兩造、皆願維持最友好之關係也、渠不願對此衝突、遽加判决事有先須確定者、公約之義務、果被破壞否乎、各種國際公約之義務、果已爲兩造尊重乎、行政院與大會之决議案、果已被兩造　守乎、國聯之辦理此問題、果以不草率或不偏袒之態度、或以堅忍與公道之精神行事乎、此爲國聯最關重要問題、因其將成立前例也、渠於原則問題言之已多、今請言事實問題、渠主張通過李頓報吿書、此書乃有價値的莊嚴的而甚公平的文件、報吿書已說明日本在滿洲與上海之軍事行動、不能認爲合法自衛之性質、此直謂國聯會員中之一國的土地爲日本所侵犯國聯盟約之未爲日本所尊重、在此情形中、未有他種結論之可能、此問題尙有一種狀態、假使發生合法自衛之問題、則必因對方有讋對的行爲而後可、徵諸李頓報吿書及雙方所交出之文件、可屬於此種性質之行爲、計有兩類、一爲抵制宣傳、甚至延及學校一爲有組織的有統系的且似爲官場所提倡的排貨運動、此種行爲、固屬可非、但國聯一會員國如任意行動之在另一會員國之土地上進行大規模之軍事行動、則國聯必須有堅决之舉動、在最後解决中、關於排外與排貨之責言、應受嚴重之考慮云、捷克代表言及創立「滿洲國」之問題、謂此亦牽涉原則等問題、並較爲嚴重、在國聯會員國之土地内因另一會員國之軍隊出現於已境、而遂成立一獨立國、試問此事果不顯然破壞國聯盟約之第十條乎、此非爲極屬危險之前例乎、假如同樣事態發生於歐洲、諸君將有何感想、防止前例之成立事屬緊要、苟他國效尤之、則後患不堪設想、國聯爲尊重條約之保障、苟有一國不尊重九國公約國聯對之、果無關係乎、今須承認者、不遵守某種條約責任、現亦加於其他方面也、十九特委會曾表示憾忱、以爲雙方不得增加時局嚴重之擔任、未經履行、特委會尤失望者、爲日本之承認「滿洲國」此舉使調解工作極感困難特别嚴重之行爲與國聯盟約及大會决議案之規定大相逕庭者業已發作、此種不公道之行爲必須理直、無論如何、國聯不能承認之、此乃關於本年三月十一日之决議案而可顯見者、吾人在根據盟約第十五條第四節開始辦理以前請兩造勿造成致使吾人必以裁判官資格行事時局、日本有光榮之歷史、而在世界第一等國中佔一位置、中國有古文明、爲今日新進國家進取志願之源流、吾人請此兩國以誠摯忠實友好之調解謀取其衝突之解决假使此舉雖有吾人之援助、而終歸失敗、則國聯此後工作、即在加以裁判國聯必有辦事之膽量、無所保留、亦無所猶豫堅决莊嚴、一秉大公、大會不能於涉及原則問題之處、　作模稜兩可之行動、縱不能得立即切實之解决、但大會堅定之意志、則不容有疑義也、</p>

<p>瑞典代表恩頓繼起演說、謂目前中日兩國之關係、實係一種變相戰爭、凡不尊重條約之行動、足在國際關係中釀成重大糾紛、　國際間之約束絕不能以某個單獨國家之自私行動而置諸不顧、此種辦法、絕對不能承認大會之責任在决定破壞條約是否爲正當自衛之行動、關於此點李頓報吿書已有明確之答案、日方謂滿洲之形勢、因新獨立「滿洲國」之成立而發生變更、但李頓報吿書中則謂、新國之成立、係由於日軍之佔領東三省、大會於通過决議案、時應根據李頓報吿書立論、當大會在本年三月三日通過决議案時、大會曾表示日軍在東三省之行動、確已侵犯另國聯會員國領土之完整、故承認「滿洲國」、實　違反盟約第十條之行爲、若在此時爲謀解决糾紛之談判、則形勢非常不妥、國聯旣不能令一方之軍隊、由另一方之領土撤、退則所有一切談判、均將在武力壓迫下舉行、如此實與盟約之精神相背馳、現形勢已極險惡故大會在决定解决之圍以前、不應中止討論也云云、</p>
<h3>挪威代表仗義執言</h3>
<p>反對任何　武主義</p>
<p>中日應受和平調解</p>
<p>此後挪威代表朗齊起立發言、首謂大會因在特殊情形之下、允許將展期討論之期限延長、彼繼對李頓調查團表示頌揚、謂李頓之報吿書、極爲公正、大會欲解决中日糾紛實以採納李頓報吿書主張爲最佳、彼又稱彼絕對反對任何國家之任意而行、不顧一切、其後朗齊續謂歷史上曾屢有以暴力佔人土地之事、但今已有國聯盟約及其他公斷條約之存在、故已有較武力佔領爲佳之調解方法云、彼又述及三月十一日之决議案、並謂彼希望中日兩國能在國聯各會員國援助之下、努力謀調解方法、且凡與遠東有利益關係之各國均願參加與國聯共同努力、且此種努、力不僅限於發表意見及解釋條約實欲謀達到解决之目的也中日兩國實互相依賴、日本或有不滿之處、但調解雙方在東三省利益之辦法、决不能無法覓得也云云、</p>

<p>（倫敦）今晚國聯同志會舉行宴會、中日使署人員亦皆在座、李頓勳爵即席演說、謂時局現已不復僅爲抽象的、亦不復僅爲法律問題、但係各個人之行爲、現知背景始終爲人的問題云、或以解决有何希望爲問、李頓答稱、渠對於上星期國聯行政院之會議發生第一印象、以爲甚少進步、但後覺行政院會議並未虚費時間、如在行政院會議中兩造皆表示接受報吿書之意思、願以此爲新談判之起點、則行政院定當歡迎此種表示、而將報吿書轉交大會、附以談判應即開始之主張、但事實雖非如此、尙有可引以爲慰之處於是大會以期望之精神舉行會議、國聯所求諸日本者、僅有兩事第、一日本對於國聯宜有充分之信任、而確知决不强其放棄其所認爲極關重要之任何利益、第二、日本應表示其願意、務使其極關重要之利益、與他國同樣重要利益不相抵觸、有人以爲僅須日本同意、即可獲取解决、其實中國同意、亦屬必要也、雙方皆不欲吾人之毁譽、但欲爲吾人所了解與信託耳云云、（六日路透電）</p>
<p>主席薛西爾勳爵演說、論及國聯大會謂渠希望大會所定之解决辦法、將能符合國聯所執持各會員國間應遵守法律與公平之原則、至於各國自有判斷其自已所爭執者之權利一層已完全不適用於今日國際間文明生活矣、（六日國民電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>國聯大會開幕以後晦</h3>
<p>一·中國之希望</p>
<p>自九一八事變而後我國政府忍辱持重處處以維護和平不輕啓衅端爲主旨是以雖失地三省我們人民亦僅和平溫厚之抵貨以答覆對方之武力侵略主義同時更充分信賴國聯縱令其决議一次兩次均被蹂躪國聯盟約華盛頓九國公約以及非戰條約悉被日本之鐵拳所撕毁「公理」「正義」一齊變爲軍國主義鐵蹄下之泥絮東北三省三百七十七萬六千七百方里之土地悉被蹂躪三千零八百餘萬之人民盡爲日人之俘虜我全國人民雖「憤怒塡胸同仇敵愾」而仍溫文有禮故自日本無故稱兵以來迄於今日我國并未與日本斷絕國交依舊使命往還此固明白顯示我國政府及人民擁護和平之存心及信賴國聯之誠意也</p>
<p>本月六日國聯特别大會旣開幕我國代表又將奮其明辯以折衝於列國樽爼之間而所希冀者爲公理正義之復活耳更望國際聯盟能禀其組織聯盟之初意爲扶植國聯之威信起見公斷旣然失效調解亦屬徒然日軍之武力侵略繼續不已匪特我國一國之損失世界和平同將受惡劣影響現旣將全案移交大會解决惟有立即適用盟約第十六條之規定國聯會員各國應「立即與（從　戰爭之日本）斷絕各種商業上或財政上之關係并阻止其他任何一國（無論）爲聨盟會員抑非聯盟會員之人民與該國人民財政上商業上或個人之往來」尤重要者爲「國聯行政院應負責向關係各國建議……各出陸海空之實力組成軍隊以維護聯盟盟約之實行」非然者國聯威信最後試騐機會一失將永不可彌補矣</p>
<p>二·日本之策略</p>
<p>日本侵略東北之初其内心固在乎攫取我國領土故昌言「中國非近代有組織的國家」以便其任意分割而外交方面則處處暗示擔任遠東防俄之第一線且唱出「滿洲門户開放」之高調同時乃亟意與蘇聯拉攏於漁業協定石油協定之外且令廣田（前駐蘇大使）回日熟籌辦法松岡過莫斯科細審蘇聯眞意以爲日蘇如果眞實成立諒解則日本併舌東北三省將不致成爲問題矣殊不知蘇聯依舊靜觀决不上日本之當且日本於發動瀋陽事變之前曾作種種準備并自謂與法蘭西已有相當默契日本之於英國老成持重未　信賴而於法國則欲引爲已助無如近日法蘇互不侵犯條約簽字美國戰債問題繼起法國欲維持其歐洲覇權對蘇衝突旣見和緩德意形勢突又緊張是以不能不求得美國之諒解而對日之援助乃不能不趨於淡薄日本與北美合衆國旣冰炭不相容對蘇聯亦僅暫時之利用其所求者仍在法國近且不惜公然示意如法國在國聯大會中能援助日本要求丨丨承認「滿洲爲旣成事實」助長中日直接交涉者遠之日本將盡力支持法蘭西所提之新軍備縮小案以保障法國之「安全」近之更可以援助法國由安南北進之國企然而究竟何如則須視世界之轉向而定不過法國距離遠東過遠利益關係甚微又不能如願取得中東路之利益恐對日的好意止於敷衍而已</p>
<p>三·國聯大會之結果</p>
<p>我國雖力持正義無奈實力太弱不克以武力爲正義之後盾致日本之氣燄愈高國聯處此當不能以我力弱而稍形袒日惟如何方能使日本就範現時國聯方忙於軍縮忙於彌縫歐洲之裂痕於遠東問題勢難兼顧且乏實力之裁制尤恐日本之堅决反對故今後情勢國聯大會將如何處置此東北問題在筆者蠡測不外以下三種傾向</p>
<p>第一、國際聯盟會員各國（以各小國爲最）皆審知日本陰謀須加裁制故主張組織有力之調解委員會介入美國及蘇聯以强制日本之就範　　第二、暫不作任何决議亦不承認「滿洲（傀儡）國」靜觀事變之轉化蓋各國明眼人均以日本不能長遠侵佔東北將因財政破綻而自陷於困境終於就國聯之範圍也</p>
<p>第三、以國聯爲介促成中日直接交涉重新遠東之均勢</p>
<p>以上三者第一及第三兩項皆爲日本所極力反對實現之機會恐亦鮮少「遷延」「靜觀」其爲將來之趨勢乎</p>

<h3>太原學潮之内幕</h3>
<p>并市數校、近忽發生歷來罕有之劇烈學潮、山西大學學生向校長王錄、要求生活費王無法應付因之表示辭職同時全市師範初中學生、因本年官方取消津貼、並徵收學費、致求學感受困難、連日向敎育廳及省政府請願、要求恢復官費制度、此外省立第一中學　發現驅逐校長崔宣言、而省立第師範學校亦因驅逐校長黃　泉、學生分爲「撥黃」「驅黃」一派發生歐鬥驅黃派中有數人被毆傷勢頗重、數日來（二十三日迄至二十七日）省立及官費各校學生丨山大·一中·一師·一女師等丨均齊集敎育廳　發、向省政府請願、並遊行示威、市上滿貼標語宣言亦街頭紛飛、大有如火燎原之勢、此次學潮發生原因、就表面觀察、似不外因晋鈔跌、農村經濟破產、人民生計困苦、求　發生問題、（晋省學生家庭中多數以農爲業、　費各校學生、十分之八九　貧寒學生、而敎育當局初不體念民艱、豁免或减輕各校舊有學費反將官費各校如一師及一女師改爲師範初中、徵收例外學費增加學生負担、以致釀成猛烈學潮、不過此中亦尙有其他之淵源與背景茲分述如次、</p>
<p>（學潮之淵源）　民國十年以前、山西敎育、表面持嚴格政策、自民國十一年省立一中驅逐校長事件發生後、當局不能裁制放縱主義、遂自此始、比及民十四十五兩年黨派交替時期、政客每利用學生團結盲動以爲　取政權之工具自此學潮汹湧、驅逐校長·罷課·請願·示威·搗毁要人住宅等事、直家常便飯、不足爲異、校長之於校務、只能取寛縱主義、對於學生、更只有抱放任態度然即此尙不免因其他關係、而動遭學生之驅逐、此次學潮、雖尙參雜其他原因、殆亦歷史之推移、其爆發非偶然也、</p>
<p>（山西大學之派别）　山大敎授中、向分兩派、一爲西洋留學生派、（如王猷臣山大校長）王監先（工科學長）等、一爲東洋留學生派、如冀貢泉（法科學長現兼任敎育廳長）張冠三等、此兩派表面雖稱合作、内中實早已水火、觀於最近學生向校長要求生活費一事頗有可疑之一點、㈠學生所要求於學校當局可能範圍内至多不過豁免學費生活費何能提出、即使請求津貼、手續上亦自另有辦法丨向原籍各縣要求津貼、或逕呈請敎育廳及省政府、何故與校長爲難㈡校長應體諒學生困苦逕將學生所請各節、轉呈敎育廳及省政府核辦、何至無法應付、並因之辭職返里、綜上兩點吾人確信大部分學生固因生活問題激動學潮、而内中不免有少數份子另有作用利用羣衆、與敎育黨局爲難、</p>
<p>（一中之高師　）　一中自民十一年驅逐校長魏日淸後、繼任者每多有後台以故政局遇有變動、而一中校長亦輒遭驅逐或自動辭職、自崔長校可謂絕無其他關係崔氏係高師（即現之師大）畢業生、充任一中英文敎員、後又兼敎務長、已有十七八年之歷史、去年山西九一八慘案（九一八慘案　省黨部槍擊學生請願案）發生、前任校長梁　泰潛逃後、梁　泰　黨部執委與慘案有關）崔氏遂繼長該校、接事以來、對於校務、積極整頓、對學生方面、更不稍爲寛假、惟對於聘請敎職員除舊日年久資深數人外悉用高師畢業生補充、不免有一系把持之　此次學生驅逐校長宣言有訾責崔氏利用私人一欵雖係借題發揮而其中似　亦持之有故</p>
<p>（一師及其他言費各校）　一師驅逐校長内容雖複雜、而取消津貼、及增加學費、　實爲主要原因之一、師範學校、向係官費學生中貧寒者、復居十分之七八、晋鈔跌落農村陷於破產、而今年水災奇重、一般生活困難、尤影響學生之求學、乃本年秋季敎育廳忽令各師範學校改名師範初中取消津貼並徵收入學學費、新生入學、一切學費、計有四十五元之多書籍膳宿費均歸自備、以致貧寒學生失學者不在少數其旣已入學者、亦多方張羅難於維持、此師範學潮之主要動因也（十一月二十八日於太原）</p>

<h3>讀者顧問</h3>
<p>㈠對於張雲秋女士所提問題之討論</p>
<p>丨參閱十二月三日本欄</p>
<p>舒惜悟君訊第㈠由於男子喜新厭舊的劣根性及女子的不能自立，第㈡女子須力求自立，否則須相當忍受。</p>
<p>程競進君訊第㈠譬如今天廚子燒上一隻雞，我們初次吃着覺得味很好，明天如此，後天仍如此，就覺得無味了，夫妻愛情由沸點降至冰點，也就是這個道理。第㈡須提倡「夫妻星期會」即夫妻二人隔地而居，每逢星期日二人約好地點相會，過此一日即各分頭工作。</p>
<p>戴克儉君訊第㈠約有五因性情不合，㈡對方醜陋，㈢生活困難，㈣男方不貞，或女方好吃懶做，㈤有了兒女之後，兒女分了丈夫的愛情。第㈡須安命，須互相原諒，須能富貴相安，貧賤相守。</p>
<p>㈡一封可以供張雲秋女士參考的訊</p>
<p>史自我女士訊我結婚祇有四年，經騐很少，本沒有資格參加討論張雲秋女士所提出婚後愛情的大問題。但我的經騐和張女士完全相反，並已經過緊要的階段（即結婚一年或二年）所以我願將自已的經騐，供獻於衆。我的丈夫最初是我的父親介紹的。初次見面沒有像人家所說的「一見傾心」。他雖祇大我五歲，可是面貎比他的年紀老，尤其是皺眉思想的時候；因之，我對父親說：「他可做我的老伯。」但我的父親很喜歡他，說了許多贊美他的話。爲取悅我的父親，我勉强約期同他交談。誰知道談話以後，我對他的印象變了，覺得他是我難得的「同志」，他的見解，思想完全與我同的。　並不是他有意遷就我的意思；那時候，我祇是發問；他回答。我們會談了幾次，漸漸的由敬生愛，由敬愛而成偶。我們相信：我們現在的愛情，比四年前結婚的時候，更濃厚，更甜蜜。至於怎能得到美满的結果，要仔細講是很難的，不過分析起來却　幾項原則。結婚關繫終身幸福。我們結婚的時候，就决定盡力使我們的生活美滿，就像上海人所謂「做夫妻」。我們從不想，萬一結婚生活失敗，怎樣？偶有不滿意，即設法開誠解决，不使事態化大。</p>
<p>我從不把自已的丈夫比較别人的，因爲這樣比較，是有損無益的。</p>
<p>結婚的生活和婚前的生活大不相同，尤其是性慾的關係。我們對於這種生活的變遷，是有準備的。我們完全遵從英人斯德潑斯的指導。他所著的結婚的愛，（ＭarieＳtopes:ＭarriedＬove此書坊問有譯本）我們兩人都仔細讀過，書中所提各問題，我們都討論過。</p>
<p>我們雙方盡力避免妒忌或誤會的一切事情。雖然如此，夫婦間小齟齬有的時候亦有的。有一時候，我們差不多天天口角，後來相約兩人大皆不要發脾氣。以後遇到發生齟齬的時候，就說「我們不是相約不准發脾氣嗎？」這麽一說，誰亦不願意再閙下去了。還有一個法子，就是互相諒解。我要存心他發脾氣，不是對我發的，他還是愛我的，大槪他在外受了别人的氣，或是身體不舒服：我應當安慰他才對。他呢，亦是這樣的待我。女子經期的時候，性情煩燥，往往爲了瑣碎小事就抱悲觀；所以我們遇到經期，格外留意。存了這心，對方有不近情的話，就不去計較。若自已不高興要發脾氣，就盡量的想對方種種好處，設法自制。實在不能自制，早些去睡覺，或到親友處玩玩，都是避免發脾氣的法子。我的丈夫平時很注意我的性情，所以我生氣的時候，　能使我笑。我倆互相留意不觸犯對方所忌的事。譬如他最忌别人寃枉他。對於這層，我就留意避免。他時常贊美我，使我不好意思做不美滿他的事；這也是他的方法。</p>
<p>關於家務，我們兩人的職責分得很淸。</p>
<p>經濟上，完全由我的丈夫負責，但我也不浪費，遵照預算開支。我們家庭經濟，有一時候很爲難，他能計算，最入爲出，不負債；因此，减少許多困難問題。家中的大事，我必與我的丈夫商量，但日常的事，他完全不問。僕　有過失，他不直接責備他們，祇對我說。我對他職務上的事，絕對不干預；因爲我知道，我若是干預，於事無補，反使他辦事格外困難。</p>
<p>我們已有小孩，但我决不因撫育小孩而忽略我的丈夫，使他工畢回家，不能得到家庭的快樂。對於敎育小孩，我們也有一定的方針，遇到賞罰的事，我們一定同意後再行。</p>

<p>一、音樂時間的排列要在用　的作業之後，不宜排在體育之後。但一二年級可常和體育游戲聯絡敎學；各年並可和舞蹈聯絡敎學。</p>
<p>二、固定唱名法就是以do爲C的固定唱名，re爲D的固定唱名，mi爲E的固定唱名，fa爲F的固定唱名，so爲G，la爲A，si爲B的固定唱名。不論音調如何變換，其唱名固定不變。卽使因變調而生的升降半音，也仍照固定唱名法隨牠的升降而固定唱名。</p>
<p>第四，敎學要點</p>
<p>初級第一學年完全用聽唱法敎學（注重歌詞的聽唱曲譜可令多聽而不可令唱）、所授歌詞最好都可表演以增加兒童的興趣、</p>
<p>二·初級二三學年是由聽唱轉入視唱時期仍注重歌詞的視唱表演、如兒童明了音樂符號的價値而需要學習時可用圖表卡片、手勢等多變化而有興趣的方法指示</p>
<p>三·初級第四學年注重視唱敎學於敎學新歌詞時、可使兒童對於簡單的樂譜作明確的學習中外樂器的方式和用法、古今民族對於音樂興趣的表現方式和用法都可開始指導</p>
<p>四·高級盡量用視唱法敎學、如遇可表演的歌曲仍須表演樂譜組織方式、各方式的目的和效力都須使兒童領會、</p>
<p>五·常和國語文學社會（例如各時代各民族的音樂設計）工作（例如農工等職業歌曲）衛生等各種設計、聯絡敎學、尤應利用社交、時令集會等的需要而授以適當的歌曲、</p>
<p>六·曲譜應盡量採用合於民族性的材料但以快樂活潑·勇壯·莊嚴而多變化的爲主悲哀消極和油腔滑調或呆板平直的材、料應該力避、</p>
<p>七·歌詞要是兒童的文學、以鼓勵兒童動作奮興個人感情發掦民族精神的爲主、不取訓話或格言爲材料</p>
<p>八·敎授新歌曲時除簡易曲譜外、應常由敎員範唱奏樂、以便兒童傾聽爲避免混淆聽覺起見範唱時最好不用樂器伴奏、</p>
<p>九·宜令見童對於歌曲忠實的吟唱、切禁隨意加入花腔滑調或信口高呌在每歌曲熱習後應多令兒童獨唱、</p>
<p>十·在可能範圍内、充分利用留聲機和地方上的各種聽樂機會而敎以欣賞音樂的方法、</p>
<p>十一·關於欣賞的敎學除特選欣賞敎材外對於演習時所唱的歌曲也須注意欣賞</p>
<p>十二·敎員態度應注意修潔和藹聲音技能、更應注意優美純熟每次敎授音樂的開始要用故事和激引感情的問題等引起兒童學習的動機　　十三·敎學時應嬌正兒童的姿勢、在發育時尤應注意</p>
<p>十四·在必要時要行呼吸以爲唱歌的預備並須練音以使吟唱無誤練音時要用種種變化的方法以使兒童不厭例如摹仿鳥呌蟲呌·風聲·風箏聲·兒啼聲·或編爲有趣的句子和兒童答和</p>
<p>十五·歌詞的敎學應使兒童先通曉歌詞的意義歌詞的感情應由敎員用態度充分的暗示例如樂亦樂憂亦憂莊亦莊諧亦諧）</p>
<p>十六·曲譜的新知識、要常和舊知識比較研究、例如四分音符和八分音符的異同、Ｇ調和Ｃ調各音階在五線上的位置的差别……都須用比較的方法以使兒童明瞭、</p>
<p>十七·歌曲的練習一時間中要多方變化、例如時而唱歌時而練音時而聽曲時而表演時而呼節時而蹈節時而拍節時而立唱、時而坐時而行唱時而齊唱時而獨唱時而分組唱……其法不一</p>
<p>十八·應注意兒童的音域聲區和呼吸發聲等如遇單音兒童其坐位當在前排或敎師兩旁、加以特殊訓練、並時時注意、不讓他妨碍全級優美純綷的唱歌聲</p>
<p>十九·兒童在變聲時期當停止唱歌、可多用開於學理方面的練習課業代替</p>
<p>二十·在可能範圍内、應隨時機（例如集會令節等）鼓勵兒童創作應用的歌曲（如利用純熟的曲譜創作歌詞等）藉以發展兒童用音樂發表情意的天才、</p>
<p>二十一·學校中應鼓勵兒童學習各種樂器并宜組織樂隊·歌劇表演會·音樂比賽會等、</p>
<p>二十二·所用樂器以風琴或提琴爲主、在經費缺乏的學校可用簫笛胡琴敎學、</p>
<p>二十三·曲譜用五線譜非萬不得已不用簡譜用五線譜敎學的絕對不得並用簡譜、</p>
<p>二十四·聽覺的訓練、應特别注重、所以五線譜的唱法可採用「唱名固定法」（就是歐美拉丁民族慣用的各調同音唱法）、但因師資缺乏的緣故、仍可採用非固定唱名法就是英美等國慣用的各調異音唱法按英美現在也有用名調同音唱法的　勢、</p>
<p>二十五·在可能範圍内應置備中外各種樂器、並特設便於音樂敎學的敎室、</p>

<h3>方形堡的攻克（一）</h3>
<p>— 法國美星美作影譯</p>
<p>我的朋友裏面有一個幾年前在希臘患署熱病死了的軍人，有一天曾經把他第一次的作戰經騐講給我聽。那故事使我非常感動，所以我隨後得閑便憑着記憶把牠寫下了。底下便是這故事：</p>
<p>×　　×　　×　　×</p>
<p>我是九月四日下午歸隊的。我在露營裏面會見了聯隊長。他起初對我頗我粗暴；可是看了Ｂ將軍的薦函後，他便改顏相持，他和我講了幾句客氣話。</p>
<p>他把我介紹給剛剛出去視察了一番回來的中隊長。這個我後來毫沒有時間認識的中隊長，是一個高大的栗髮的男子，具有一副嚴厲而使人討厭的面貎。他以前當過小兵，他在戰塲上取得了他的肩章和十字勛章。他的聲音啞而低，和他那巨大的身體絕不相稱。别人吿訴我，他這奇怪的聲音，是伊愛拿之役，一顆把他打個對穿的子彈的恩惠。</p>
<p>他聽說我是由楓丹白露砲兵學校出身的，他便做了一個醜臉說；</p>
<p>丨我的中尉昨天死了……</p>
<p>我知道他的意思是說：「當去補他的缺的是你，而你却不配幹這事。」我想要回答他一句利害的話，但我忍住了。</p>
<p>月亮從那和我們的露營隔着兩叚大砲射程的舍威里諾方形堡的後面昇起。牠大而且紅，和牠平常昇起來的情形一樣。可是這天晚上，在我看來牠是特别大。暫時之間，那方形堡在一輪燦爛的明月前面顯出分明的黑影。牠彷彿爆發時的火山的圓錐似的。在我身旁的一個老兵對這月亮的顏色注意了。</p>
<p>丨這月亮紅得很利害，他說；這即是表示這著名的方形堡要犧牲很多人才能夠取得啊！</p>
<p>我向來是狠迷信的，尤其是在這個時候，這預兆不禁使我感動了。我去睡，但我不能睡着。我起來走了一會，一面走着，一面瞧着那籠罩舍威里諾村對面一帶小山的廣闊的戰線。</p>
<p>當我覺得晚上凉爽侵肌的空氣已經夠使我的血液冷靜了的時候，我便回到火旁；我細心地用披風包着自已的身子，閉上眼睛，希望在天明以前不再張開。可是瞌睡老是不來。我的思想便不知不覺地沉入愁慘之境。我心想在佈滿了平原的十萬人裏面，我一個朋友都沒有，如果我受了傷，我便會睡在一個病院裏面，受一些沒有知識的外科醫生的疏忽的看待。我所聽到的許多關於外科手術的故事，都在我的記憶中湧現了。我的心猛烈的跳着，我機械般的整理着那好像一種鐵甲似的掛在胸上的手巾和皮包。我疲倦得不能支持了，我時時假寐，但時時被一種不吉的念頭强有力的把我驚醒起來。可是疲倦畢竟戰勝了，當敲着晨鼓時，我完全睡着了。我們列隊，點名，隨後我們把槍一束一束的架着，一切都預吿我們可以過一天安靜的日子。</p>
<p>到三點鐘的時候，一個副官帶着一道命令來了。人家又呌我們拿着兵器；我們的衝鋒隊散佈在平原上，我們跟在他們後面慢慢地前進，二十分鐘後，我們看見所有俄國兵的前哨，都退却了，都回到方形堡裏面去了。</p>
<h3>關於住的話</h3>
<p>— 曼</p>
<p>宇宙原是一間大屋子，人，帶哭而來，含笑而去，都像是夢也似的過路客。唯其是過客，所以當還沒有抽出最後一口冷氣之前，總得把這一刹那時光，消受個暢快，即不爲後人打算，自一世二世以至萬萬世，但自身總該有一塊地可以好好的立足，這裏便發生了「住」的問題。</p>
<p>照一般人想，天地如此其大，到處皆可爲家，而且自穴居野處進化到現在，紅牆碧瓦，幾乎蓋遍了五洲萬國，即孫生子，子生孫，人口一天多過一天，又誰信會找不着住處？</p>
<p>然而事情却偏不是如此，你瞧，那環堵蕭然，不避風日的，那鳩形鵠立，寄人籬下的，那托庇於露天塲合，以天作錦羅地作氈而沐風櫛雨的，眼前都是，又何止千千萬萬。俗話更有說：「生無立錐之地，死無葬身之所，」這天地，果眞算得「大」嗎？</p>
<p>但在另一方面，却也有五步一樓十步一閣的阿房宮有長列四十里的錦帳，即如北平的紫禁城，九灣八曲，這兒宮，那兒殿，還有屋子裏舖上地氈，砌上大理石，佈置着小花園，大菜間，還加上三幾處公館，以及别墅之類的，也不過是爲了「住。」拿「生無立錐之地」的一羣與這住阿房宮的一羣相較，我們雖不願效法劉邦，長嘆一口氣，說：「大丈夫不當如是耶！」但這宇宙大屋子，是屬於大家所有，旣然都像夢也似的過客，則硬呌一部份人無地容身，而另一部份人却「得其所哉，得其所哉，」則至少這世界發生了缺憾！嗚呼，「安得廣厦千萬間，廣庇天下寒士皆歡顏！」</p>

<h3>給小朋友們</h3>
<p>— 碧雲</p>
<p>可愛的安格，我的小寳貝：</p>
<p>自然是爲了無聊才將所有幾封朋友的來信從抽屜中取出來一頁頁地亂翻，在你母親的信後面發現你問候我的幾個字，我馬上想到要給你寫封信，雖然我的字跡潦草，說的話你也有很多不明白的，但是你的母親會唸給你聽，會比我更寫得好的解釋給你聽。小寳貝，只要你懂得了我說的是什麽的三分之一，我都滿意了，這封信的使命算達到目的了，可愛的孩子，你好好地看這封信吧。</p>
<p>今天是雨天，据說日本老是這樣的天氣，很少有晴的時候，起初我不信，住了二十天後，眞的證明了她們的話沒有錯。在這二十天中，我只看見過兩次太陽，一次月亮，可是不到三個鐘頭说陰下來了，天空浮着灰暗悲慘的雲，死氣沉沉地象徵着日帝國主義者的前途。</p>
<p>在這樣的氣候裏生活着的人最容易發牢騷，尤其是我這生長在太陽最强烈的南方的人，來過這種生活，眞是痛苦極了。，我難過，我的心裏只是一陣陣發癢，眼中也像有什麽東西要跳出來似的，可是一分鐘過去了，那東西還沒有出來，我知道牠是被理智壓住了，因爲牠如果出來，這封信也許就寫不成。</p>
<p>今天是雙十節，你的學校一定放假，你這時也許正坐在你母親旁邊讀書，也許正在玩着小槍，也許在望着天空發呆，假若上海也像這裏一樣地下着雨，那你一定更不高興了，因爲你不能出外玩，而你的母親趁着雨天要多寫點東西的。她不但不帶你玩，講故事你聽，而且會禁止你說話，禁止你唱歌，甚至你動一動她都要干涉你。咳，可憐的孩子呵，我替你着急，如果上海像這里一樣今天是雨天，那麽你怎麽過去呢？也和我一樣煩悶嗎？</p>
<p>不知爲什麽我的腦筋裡很少有忘記孩子們的時候，這並不是我有了一個孩子的原故，而是我生來就喜歡小孩。因爲我覺得只有小孩是天眞的，純潔的，忠實的，他沒有虚僞，沒有驕傲，也沒有一切卑劣陰狠的行爲，他沒有階級的思想。富人家的孩子不好，這見他家裡敎壞他的。三字經上的「人之初性本善」，的確一點也不錯呵！</p>
<p>安格，你的確太可憐了！和你同在一個弄堂的孩子們，都比你幸福，他們有小汽車，有洋娃娃，有美麗的衣服和鞋帽，冬天還有大衣，絨帽，坐包車去上學，老媽子接送，……但是你呢連飯都有時吃不飽，偶然偷了你母親的兩個銅板去買糖，回來要挨一頓毒打。還記得嗎？可愛的小寳貝！那是我離國之前三天，你的母親來約我和另一位女友吃飯，我知道她是請不起客的，因此我們去時買了四個鷄蛋帶去，但是後來居然這鷄蛋沒有煮，原來桌上已擺好了一碗豆腐乾炒肉丁，白菜，蝦米蘿蔔湯。「菜夠了嗎？」你母親帶着害羞的苦笑詢問我們。</p>
<p>「夠了，夠了，當然夠了！」這是我們给她的回答。</p>
<p>到現在我還要問你，小寳貝，究竟那四個鷄蛋是什麽時候煮了吃的？你吃了幾個？媽媽沒有打你嗎？</p>
<p>唉！說到打，我眞爲你痛心！就是那次我們在你家吃飯的時候，你的母親爲了你吃菜太多，忙用筷子在你的柔嫩的，白胖得像包子似的小手上狠狠地敲了幾下，我們大爲你抱不平，責備她不該如此凶暴，她很嚴肅地回答我們：「你們不知道，他每天只吃菜，吃鹹了，拼命地喝水，這樣不但於身體有害，而且爲他一天到晚不知要買多少次開水！」</p>
<p>唉！小寳貝呵，你知道嗎？你媽媽連買開水的錢都不容易得到的呵！她整于握着一支筆桿不停地寫着，有時嘆息，有時下淚，有時竟像瘋子一般大笑大哭起來，小寳貝，這都是爲了生活的壓迫，而弄到精神如此苦痛，如此反常呵！</p>
<p>這封信只說到這里停住了，等你的回信來後，我再說其他的話吧。</p>
<p>祝你和你同命運的小朋友們活潑，愉快！</p>
<h3>命盡脈絕</h3>
<p>— 子房</p>
<p>「敎育爲國家的命脈」，這句「新生」的常談，我們似乎聽到過狠久；狠久；然而我們眼睛所看見的，不是某省某省小學經費數月未發，便是某處中學敎職員閙廰索欠，或者某家某家大學因無欵已正式停辦。</p>
<p>在這種欠薪，斷炊成爲普偏化的敎育危機之下，學生一一成爲無所適從的遊蕩份子，敎職員十九變做了少衣缺食的窮苦災民；假使「敎育爲國家的命脈」是句屬實的話，那末我們這老大病夫之國，目前確實已到了命盡脈絕的一個階段！</p>
<p>科學</p>
<h3>電視</h3>
<p>— 鶴</p>
<p>電視是以無線電（Ｒadio）原理而將音影同時播送的科學發明。英名爲Ｉelevision，日本譯爲電視。</p>
<p>遠處的播音臺的演講與音樂的放送由於電波的傳遞經過受音機的擴音機，使你們能夠聽着與播音臺同樣的演講或音樂，這是無綫電播音。因爲這只能聽着聲音，所以這是『耳的無線電』。</p>
<p>那末這裏所要說的乃是影的無線電放送，即是所謂「眼的無綫電」。譬如發電臺在演着四郎探母的京戲，經過電波的傳送，於是四面八方的Ｔelevision收影機中便如開映有聲電影似的使人們看到戲子的動作而且聽着唱戲。</p>
<p>關於電視的播送機與受影機的構造，因限於篇幅，不能詳細說明。現將其原理槪括言之如下。</p>
<p>例如梅蘭芳在播影臺上唱着蘇三起解，他的姿態便通過球形鏡（Ｌens）而成爲小的照相，然而經過尼普可氏圓盤而將這影射至光電管，光電管將光變爲電氣，再送入送影機而成爲電波，最後由天線（Ａnlenna）播送出去。丨這是播送方面。</p>
<p>其次再說明其受影機。將由天綫上所受着的電波引入電視收影機的增幅器中，再導入將電氣通過光而變其影度的裝置中，然後因强光的照射，乃顯出强弱不同的光線在白布上活躍，而遠方的梅蘭芳之姿態便在我們眼前低顰淺笑了。至於聲音的發受，即爲無綫電播聲與受音：將聲音變爲電波，同樣由天綫發出，再將電波從天綫上收下，重復變爲聲音而擴大的發送出來。</p>
<p>因爲那面發聲發影同時動作，而這面的收音收影亦同時動作，所以便如坐在家裏看有聲電影一樣了。</p>
<p>關於這一科學，各國仍在競爭的繼續研究，可以說還是試騐時代。無疑義的Ｔelevision的應用至廣，俄國近年來努力實行，使其裝置普遍鄕村，而成爲民衆敎育的有力的工具。</p>

<h3>時代与愛的歧路八</h3>
<p>— 張資平</p>
<p>她臨下去時，翻轉頭來望了望錦華，笑着說。　　「……你放心吧？」</p>
<p>「不放心。」</p>
<p>「那末，我不下去了，等你一齊下去。」</p>
<p>她故意停住了脚步。</p>
<p>「她是和你的妹妹閙着什麽自由戀愛的，一定是個摩登靑年，你要當心些。說話也要小心，不要給他見笑了。」</p>
<p>「什麽自由戀愛，這些話我聽也聽厭了。由自由戀愛的結合，沒有一個家庭有好結果的。還是我們的結合幸福，父母之命，媒妁之言。我們從前都是不認識的，又有什麽不好呢？」</p>
<p>「但是，我們是野蠻的結合喲。由他們的摩登靑年看來，把不相認識的男女關在一間房裏……是一種罪惡喲。……」</p>
<p>「又瞎說了！」</p>
<p>「所以我們都是犯了罪惡的。」</p>
<p>「不聽了，不聽了。」</p>
<p>「我倆在最初的一晚上，佩珍的態度……哈，哈，哈！」</p>
<p>佩珍伸出雙手掩着耳朶走向下面去了。錦華望不見她之後，才止了笑。他聽見他的夫人吹着口笛，一步一步的下扶梯去了。她唱的像是一種跳舞曲。</p>
<p>海泉看見了自已的愛人的姊姊了，使他震驚的是佩珍的顏面輪廓和眉目口鼻的配置都比她的妹妹漂亮。隨着這個警異·他的全身也起了一陣輕微的戰慄，應答她的時候，聲音也意外的顫動。他漸次看出了她姊妹的區别點來了，姊姊的身材是富於肉感性，妹妹的身材太瘦削了。姊姊的面貎比較圓滿，妹妹有點尖小。姊姊的表情是歡快的，妹妹的表情是憂鬰的。姊姊的態度是感情的，妹妹的態度是理智的。</p>
<p>他覺得佩珍並不如外面所傳說的那樣驕傲。關於廣東方面，她問了他許多的話。最後，她還吿訴他，要和自已家裏人一樣，時常來頑。</p>
<p>過了一刻，那位任碩士也下來招呼他。海泉只覺得他是一個十足的美國留學生。說起話來，時時插入幾句英文。只一個“Ｓure”，海泉聽了不知幾十次了。他的雙手插在兩個褲袋裏，每說一句笑話，便抽抽他的肩膀。</p>
<p>「何以外面的人都說他夫妻倆驕傲呢？他倆不是很和婉可親的人麽？」</p>
<p>海泉又想，大槪是對自已才這樣吧。因爲自已和他們是有裙帶的關係。</p>
<p>海泉原想坐一刻就吿辭的。但是見了這位任碩士夫人後，不想就走了。和她談了一會話，更覺得她是有足以使人留戀的魅力。</p>
<p>他終於在他們家裏吃了一頓午飯。從任家吿辭出來時，已經三點多鐘了。任碩士還特别呌了一部汽車送他回Ｆ橋北的曾敎授家裏來。</p>

<h3>紗花紗市狀態平靜</h3>
<p>紗廠停止夜工尙難成爲事實</p>
<p>棉紗市情又趨平靜之局、但形勢微露堅硬之氣、因紗廠提議滅縮工作事件、使得人心飄蕩不定、多數均持觀望態度、因之市氣遂呈立定之象、而市上客銷亦略爲活動、不過同行中購進二十支三羊紗有四百六十包以其價便宜之故、並非實際生意就目前環境論之、存底太厚、深恐仍難大升、</p>

<h3>定購洋麥之辦法（續）·志·德</h3>
<p>（價格之增損）　關于洋麥或本麥在交易所交割時價格之增損爲有品質優劣之别、超過標準麥者酌加（升格）低於標準者酌减（降格）、茲爲分述於左</p>
<p>坎拿大麥　二號麥一百五十三斤爲合格、照標準升二錢五分、三號麥一百五十一斤爲合格升二錢四號麥一百四十九斤爲合格、升一錢、坎拿大麥身分平均、在交易所交割時、祇須依據原來等級、卽可享受標準之升格、</p>
<p>澳洲麥　分爲兩種、西部麥、身量特重、最高者照標準可升二錢九、分南部麥身分均次、依照標準升七分至一錢不等、惟交易所之規定、凡洋麥交割者以司碼秤一百四十六斤爲標準、合標凖者升二錢五分、以後每加一斤加升二分、依次遞升、凡至一百四十八斤以上不再升、一百四十五斤升二錢三分、一百四十四斤升二錢一分、一百四十三斤升一錢八分、一百四十二斤升一錢五分、一百四十一斤升一錢二分、一百四十斤升七分、以下則不再升、</p>
<p>芝哥加麥　其交割情形略等于坎拿大麥紅麥、至一百五十斤者升二錢三分、至一百四十八斤以下不合格普通定貨、大致以二號麥爲宗</p>
<p>國產小麥　在交易所交割時、以每石（海斛）一百三十九斤至一百四十斤爲合格、平時以一車（卽五百担）爲單位、至實際交割亦得變通、少者以四百八十五担爲最低額、多者以五百十五担爲最高額如、超過規定之額外時其或多或少之分量、依據交割之價格、均須受九五折扣計算、以示限制、平時以京滬車三十噸爲標準、因其適合五百担之故、至各處包子、雖大小不同、然均以重量爲率惟交割之等級、則較洋麥爲繁瑣、</p>
<p>㈠升格　一百四十一斤升二分、一百四十二斤升四分、一百四十三斤升六分爲最多則不再升</p>
<p>㈡降格　一百三十八斤降二分、一百三十七斤降五分、一百三十六斤降九分、一百三十五斤降一錢三分、一百三十四斤降一錢八分、一百三十三斤降二錢五分、再次不及格未能交割、其中如有雜質或泥灰等以百分之三爲準篩凈時如有或多或少則照升或照除</p>
<p>觀以上本麥與洋麥之升降等級、未免發生兩種之觀感、第一洋麥之升級最高時竟達二錢九分、最低亦達一錢左右、交割之標準、最低以一百四十六斤爲合格、最高達一百四十八斤以上、本麥之升級、最多者升六分、彷彿已屬鳳毛麟角、交割之標準爲一百三十九斤至一百四十斤、最次低至一百卅三斤、降格至二錢五分兩兩比較、洋麥之最高、與本麥之最低標準之升降、差度竟達五錢四分之巨、農產物之良窳判然、改良種植提高品質、實已不容再緩、况乎低劣之產物、又因種種關係、不能保持原有之生產、致使製粉廠唯競以訂購洋麥是務、可憐亦復可痛、亟起挽救、全國人士與有責焉、（完）</p>
<h3>穏健的棉市</h3>
<p>廠商對本月份抛額時有抵進</p>
<p>棉市尙挺、形勢穏靜、據美棉轉漲、而市上現棉枯薄、自某廠部抛出大批、搜查十二月份中（卽本月期）約有五萬多　、目前各路到源甚稀祇得時有低進、市氣因之愈緊、惟遠期不動而平據濟南通信云、山東當地存棉現有八九萬包、（每担麥價四十一二元）該處有一日商棉行倒閉影響市價突落云、</p>
<p>（各月鄭標都好五分）　鄭標前市開盤、初以美棉上漲、市氣隨之而高、二三盤以紗市無力又落、結果漲五分、午後市氣仍有信誠抵空、各月漲五分至一錢、全日成交統計二萬四千四百担、查賣出長豐一千担、賡　八百担、同興七百担、吉　六百担、買進明德一千一百担、、信誠一千担、穗隆六百担、新亨七百担、茲將收盤價列下</p>

<h3>糧食標粉後市步入堅局</h3>
<p>丨浮多吸收故意抬價丨</p>
<p>昨日粉市、上午各月份市面、呈初跌繼穏之象、以洋麥報價、回小一二角不等、故初開時、人心虚軟近遠期較前日曾又小進分、以後各盤、因浮空低補甚急客帮亦微有交易、廠家現貨、仍少積起兵船仍喊一兩九錢、阜豐之貨、尙係解交前月份故人心似又漸佳、迨至下午開盤、各月份又步堅定因浮多吸收故意抬價、廠方祇阜豐略有抛出、餘則不動、往後觀察、須現貨寛裕、然後方能眞實鬆動也、結果本月份較前日好五厘、一月份好一分二厘半、二月份好七厘半、三四月份好五厘、五月份好七厘半云、</p>
<h3>期麥大勢平疲</h3>
<p>丨買氣略淡開價小挫丨</p>
<p>昨期麥市面、大致呈平疲勢、因洋麥報小一二角、業内外人心、自然轉平、不過本年實在籌碼、始終不暢、買賣雙方、均難用神、以行家籌碼、諒未到其時、未願出檔、惟買氣較淡、開價略疲</p>

<h3>糖市粗砂糖市價再跌</h3>

<h3>南北貨海圓肉久擯成殭局</h3>
<p>海南圓肉、前因漲度過速、貨主一味望高、堅守甚力、初擬扳到三十兩、旋因各方銷胃轉滯、而同時廉州元肉一再回跌、前後竟達五六兩、故前批所到海南貨久擯之後、已成殭局、現旣不能過高、亦不能過賤、進退維谷、號盤依然停滯云、</p>

<h3>自殺</h3>
<p>— 天方</p>
<p>自殺，這多魔殘酷的一個名詞，自殺的增加，是社會病態露骨的表示，然而在自詡爲「有組織」的國家中，不絕地表現着，據華聯社二日東京電，</p>
<p>日社會局調查，因經濟恐慌，失業飢餓而尋短見之母子有一千四百九十人，幼童被迫同死者八百十二人，</p>
<p>這電報倘給日内瓦國際聯盟各代表看見了，正在大吹大擂的日代表松岡，不知是否要認爲「遺憾」？</p>
<p>本來日本的自殺案，是出名的，自殺的藝術，更有所謂「切腹」的方法，據說非此不足以表示「勇敢」，但一個人到了不想與環境奮鬭，而出於自殺一途時，其勇敢的程度，也夠可憐的了，這就所謂「大和魂」，由於這種殘酷的對付自已的心理，反映到外面，造成侵略的行爲，這是必然的邏輯。</p>
<p>從歷史上說，中日戰爭時候的日本，固然有異於被美艦威逼通商時候的日本，而現在的日本，却也大異於日俄戰爭時候的日本，日本自「中日」「中俄」兩次戰爭以後，固然得到一時的興盛，從此走上了資本主義的路，但近年來因世界經濟鬭爭的尖銳化，國内社會的不景氣，失業人數的增加，從去年四月到今年九月，已由四十八萬增加到五十萬，丨注意這是一個七千萬人口的國家，丨而靑年思想的左傾，丨如去年早大二萬學生的大罷課，最近幾次的大檢舉丨尤使當局頭痛，「思想善導」恐不是空言所能收效的罷，所以從社會組織間的裂痕去探討這「東方的德意志」正蒙着「瓦解」的危險，現在雖靠緊張的情緖維繫着，而裂痕也因極度緊張而加深，但在這時候軍閥却像發了狂，「蠻幹」「硬幹」竭力的想開拓，從去年「九一八」强佔我東省以來，我國人民固然受到生命財產的損失，但「殺人三千，自傷八百」，日本的結果，也未見得有利，不過造成了千百個孤兒寡婦，來換取千百里地方，而後患正無窮，倘我國的經濟絕交與義軍的武力抵抗能持久作戰，丨丨不希望國際因「逐鹿」而起的變化丨丨不出丨二年，我們可以看到這個「野心未得國先壞」的國家的崩潰，所以他們這樣的找出路，是「投河」，豈止是「上坂」，而我們的不抵抗，也在等於自殺。</p>

<h3>有機顏料</h3>
<p>— 改造</p>
<p>天然之有機顏料，不甚多，如靛藍，藤黃，及烏賊黑等等，此外名爲天然品，而實爲人造者亦有，有機色素，可以分爲二類：自動物或植物内提出者，謂之天然色素，從煤膏製造而得者，曰人造色素，屬於染料範圍之内，凡有機色素遇金屬鹽類化合而成，不易溶於水之有色沉澱，總稱曰色膏（ＬaＫe）茲將天產品數種重要顏料分載如下：</p>
<p>藤黃丨藤黃爲一種天然之樹脂，割去其皮，以竹管接取，使之自然流出，蒸去其汁，可得黃色膠狀物，此膠狀物即爲藤黃，藤黃無一定分子式，溶化於水，成濃厚之乳濁，故於水彩繪畫顏料極爲相宜，但不能直接應用於油漆，須混以氧化鋁等塡料而用之。</p>
<p>烏賊黑丨烏賊魚體上有小袋，袋中含有一種黑汁，取出而乾燥之，使溶於氫氧化钠溶液中，加鹽酸，即生沉澱，滤過，烘乾得黑色顏料，能耐久，易與，</p>
<p>他種顏料相混和，多供色彩畫之用。</p>
<p>茶褐丨以氧化鐵與有機物質混和而成，有天產品者，燃燒骨屑橡木等，亦可製出之，耐久性强，遮蓋力亦大，且易與他種顏料相混和，故其應用頗廣。</p>
<p>靛藍丨植物之含靛藍者，其幹葉中原含一垂糖質，經醱酵作用或加酸分解而得靛藍及葡萄糖，（ＣoＨi2Ｏ6）但現今自煤膏製成之人造靛藍日益繁多，天然產品漸漸替落。</p>
<p>靛藍不易溶解於水酒精等溶劑内與之淡酸亦無甚影響，遇濃硫酸作用可以溶化，溶後若加氫氧化鈉中和之，即得可溶性之鈉鹽，蒸發而取得之粉末，即商品之可溶靛藍，其主要之用途爲製藍色墨水及動物纖維之着色料。其分子式甚複雜，今通認之構造式爲：</p>
<p>Ｃ６Ｈ４　ＮＨ∨　　　　　　ＮＨ４</p>
<p>∧ＣＯ　　Ci一C∧ＣＯ　∨　Ｃ６Ｈ４</p>
<p>洋紅（Ｃarminered）當雌的呀囒虫（</p>
<p>Ｃochineal）產卵時期，收集此虫，乾蒸之可得。洋紅與水共煑即得美麗之赤色溶液，此色素有酸之特性，與金屬或金屬氧化物化合，得有色之沉澱顏料，或稱色膏，故洋紅者，乃其酸與鋁或他種金屬化合所成之赤色顏料也，紅極鮮明與金屬化合之色，以鋁爲最佳，錫之化合物較次，凡繪畫，色料及油漆應用均極相宜，對於日光尙堅定久，則略受影響而已，洋紅之化學分子式爲ＣiiＨi2Ｏo</p>
<p>茜根紅（Ｍadderrootred）丨茜根紅多產於茜草之根，近者，亦多製自煤膏，易溶於水，遇硵精，苛性鈉溶液變爲赤紫色，此液與種種金屬氧化物化合而成各種不同色之色膏，例如與氧化鋁成紅色，與氧化鐵成褐色，與氧化　成棕色，與氧化鈣成赤色。</p>
<p>由茜根紅製成之顏料，缺乏遮蓋力，此顏料之用途在於纎維之染色，用時，不與纎維直接結合，必先將纎維浸漬於金屬鹽之溶液中，更移入茜根紅之溶液煑沸，使之結合。此時，金屬鹽之不同，可得不同之色固着於纎維。宜留意之。又茜根紅之主要成分爲茜根精（Ａlizarne）其式如下：</p>

<h3>矛盾</h3>
<p>— 賓符</p>
<p>晚風吹來使人覺着怪冷的。無數的黃包車夫蟄伏在門角落裏發抖，周大少爺可是在會客室裏踱圈子。</p>
<p>忽然，門外邊鈴聲響了，周大少爺即忙接上去，一個半西洋式裝束的女人走了進來。</p>
<p>『走吧，我來得太遲了』。她進門沒有坐下，就這麽說。</p>
<p>男的沒有說什麽，看着女的蓬勃的亂髮和緋紅的嘴唇中間丟出來的明媚的微笑。</p>
<p>兩個人走了出來。</p>
<p>她左臂挾書包的地位，現在給一隻男人的右臂侵佔去了，她底書包伏到那男人的左臂下。他們對準了脚步，極慢極慢地走着。他感着安慰，她也有愉快，一切都是熱烘烘的。</p>
<p>『蜜絲方，昨夜在中央飯店的一夜，嘿，今朝想來還使人感着愉快。』</p>
<p>『别講起啦，今天我已受了母親的責罰丨』</p>
<p>『眞的那我眞對不起了。』</p>
<p>『嗤………………。』</p>
<p>『我底愛啊，你看那黃葉紛飛，多麽有着詩意的秋啊！我們别辜負了這樣的景色，我們天天看電影，也有些膩了，還是到公園裏去散一會步吧。』</p>
<p>女的沉吟了一會說：</p>
<p>『對不起，我有些兒頭痛啦丨且候明天罷。</p>
<p>『那也好丨』男的感著一種失望，可是沒法駁回她。</p>
<p>到了一座黃色矮牆的洋房的門口。</p>
<p>『再會了，對不起，你明天來看我吧』她拿加回了書包，撒去了左手。</p>
<p>『唔，……………………』他悵惘地走了。</p>
<p>她走進了家門，另一個漂亮的面龐在她家裏的會客室等候着：</p>
<p>『怎麽遲？可要令人等得不耐煩了。』這個男的走近她把書包接過去了以後，又接過了大衣，把牠掛在衣架上。</p>
<p>『你不耐煩了嗎？那你何必等我？』</p>
<p>『不，不，那裏？那裏？我底……，我們走吧，五點差了十分了。』</p>
<p>更換了一套簇新的晚裝之後，她同那男的在到×大戲院去的路上親密地偎倚着。他感着安慰，她有着愉快。</p>
<p>×　×　×　×　×</p>
<p>『韻妹，你看那月色是多麽底淸綺啊！』</p>
<p>『是啊，眞美麗丨可惜有些兒冷。』</p>
<p>『你冷麽』他把她更挾緊了一些。</p>
<p>『不，我說秋夜的月色，更使人增了凄凉。但我覺得秋夜眞富有詩意的。』</p>
<p>『不錯，我就不相信人家說最美麗的是春天啊。』</p>
<p>『…………………』</p>
<p>『韻妹，我眞愛你，你眞是我底小天使，你像秋夜一樣的富有詩意。也祇有這月色啊，才能比得上你底芳潔。』</p>
<p>他把她更擁得貼緊些。</p>
<p>『韻妹，我想時候不早了啦，我們還是到東方飯店去暢談一夜罷。』</p>
<p>『唔，可以，明天的功課是討厭的幾何和生物，我預備請一天假了。』</p>
<p>他們决定了路向，開始加緊了脚步走，他溫柔到萬分，她驕傲到極點。他更安慰，她更愉快。</p>
<p>經過了　藝塲　塲門口的燈光死白的照着行人道上憧憧的人影，這些人影都是一些女人。這些女人的嘴唇，正像韻妹一樣的紅，這些女人的頭髮，正像韻妹一樣的蓬勃。但她們仿佛沒有一個比得上韻妹的有「詩意」和美麗，因爲她們儘是追求着男人，男人竟沒有一個去疼愛她們。</p>
<p>『唉，你看，眞可憐啊！』她指着那長列的女人，感慨地說。</p>
<p>『是啊，賣了身體還不夠，還得鎭　　夜忍着凍餓站立着，唉！』</p>
<p>『……………………』</p>

<h3>讀談言國文課有感</h3>
<p>— 一萍</p>
<p>脫離了學校三年，當時的天眞已換上了假面具。在這裏（本刋）看到不少學校寫眞的文字的時候，也像夢一般的幻想到從前；但是沒有勇氣提起筆來寫一些當時的生活。今天佛君的談言國文課。我想起了我的敎師孫經笙先生。</p>
<p>誠然，每一個中學以上的學生，不肯多放一些功夫在國文上。理由是學校當局注意英算及各種科學；國文能免强通過就行了，而大半的學生是爲了學分和文憑來的。（當然我自已也是這樣）但是我離校三年，完全握着筆桿吃飯，後悔從前的輕視國文，更不得不想起孫經笙先生。</p>
<p>孫經笙已有六十開外的年紀，須下美髯，宛如于右任氏，但是老當益壯，精神　鑠，上課總竭力敎誨我們。更不像旁的國文先生，爲了學生不聽他的講學而搥抬拍桌，孫先生老是婉言相勸，有時更參挿歡諧的口吻，使我們對於國文並不感到疲倦。如其同學們眞的打着瞌睡，或者預備下一課的功課；孫先生在特别緊要一段前一定預先聲明這一段很重要，意思暗示不注意的同學，這一段將來或者要作爲考試題目，於是同學們想到學分關係，再致力在這張講義上，但也有故意聲明的時候。</p>
<p>還有白話文，在上了年紀的國文先生總竭力反對，他們以爲把「靑天」改作「靑的天」有什麽意思。但是孫先生隨學生的便，他自已還在研究白話文。而且歡迎同學們到他臥室中去談天，什麽都好，就是講戀愛也行關於孫先生的事很多，我因爲從「國文課」想起自已在循循善誘的孫先生門下沒有好好讀書，如今在吃筆桿兒飯的時候感到筆不應心的困難，寫下點一些雜感而已。</p>
<p>店員通訊</p>
<h3>左右爲難的一個問題</h3>
<p>身爲職員，兼理賬務，治事自問尙勤，服務未敢或忽。惟近因店中師母，（店東另有高事，故不居一處），因吸烟嗜賭之故，在余處賬上借用洋百元，久久未還。忽焉店東查賬，余即以實吿，但店東至師母處查問，師母則謂「已於今晨託其姪交我」。嗣店東復來余處，余又確吿以「未有」。次日，晤其姪，其姪謂余曰：『汝知昨日之事否？店東對師母大發其雷霆，故師母甚憾汝，謂汝未能爲彼遮掩，彼乘店東之出，即將百元交我，命我於今晨還汝，並囑轉吿汝可自認錯誤，謂當時未能查得，但我思如此說法於你殊不妥，故於店東第二次至師母處查問時，我即自已負責聲明云：「此洋師母確於上午交我，我爲他事所阻，故未克即行送至賬房，今固尙在衣袋中耳。」等語，此事方吿平息。「余逖聽之下，深佩其智而感其德，當向表示謝意而别。惟思及師母之如此作爲，不知究何居心？恐終將凶多吉少。此後究當如何應付此左右爲難之一問題？希不吝珠玉，予以賜敎幸甚。</p>

<h3>寫給友人之妻（續一）</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>因爲我所有的三位老弟，都是同父異母的關係，我們是絕對沒有感情的．比鄕鄰還不如。所以，自小我對於氣味相投的同學，便有一種異乎常人的傾向，作爲一種替代「手足之愛」的慰藉。周大經也是被認爲氣味相投的一個。</p>
<p>在家鄕動身的前一天，林寳成丨也是一個同學丨吿訴我說：周大經已娶了一個很美，很活潑的妻子，這次也同到了上海；不過他那時並不曾把你的名字連帶吿訴我。說實話，當我聽的時候，也並不曾特别的加以注意，祇像在報紙上讀了一叚平淡的新聞之後，極稀薄地在腦海上留下一絲影子罷了。</p>
<p>「想不到由於失戀的悲哀，以致於很早就喪失了他的靑春底活潑的周大經，竟在無聲無臭之中，娶了親了；娶的又是一個很美，很活潑的妻子。這是多麽出人意外啊！」就在我到上海一天的晚上，我便决意上西華德路來參觀你們的新家庭。當電車過了鄧脫路之後，在我的複雜而紊亂的腦神筋裏，突然有這樣的一個側重於好奇心的念頭，很急促地奔騰着。</p>
<p>那時候，你們所住的屋子眞是又幽雅，又淸麗，短而密的灌木，像衛隊似的排列在大門前的甬道上，雖然中間並沒有那些色調濃艶的花卉點綴着，祇有一抺色的深綠，但是越顯得美麗整潔。其實不是這樣的屋子，也不配安頓你這麽一位人間安琪兒啊！後來我常是這樣的想着。</p>
<p>我的漆皮鞋在石級上迸出很淸脆的足音來的時候，掛着綠色的紗簾的短窗，立刻有一扇打開了。探出來的是一顆男人的腦袋。丨很驀生的一顆。</p>
<p>光潤而整齊的長頭髮，已剪成短得像汗毛似的平頂了；微黃的臉色，似乎是受了長時期的煤氣的薰蒸，而變爲淡黑色了；鼻子上也添了一具以前所沒有的深光眼鏡。周大經簡直已死過一次，而又重新投胎了！</p>
<p>「找誰」？我固然已不認識他，他也沒有瞧明白是我。像戒嚴時候的哨兵，向一個行人喝問「口令」一般的，我就出乎意料的接受了他這個嚴厲的質問。</p>
<p>形態儘可改換，聲音却總是不變的；虧得他這麽一開口，我才知道是他了。同時，門上一塊不很注目的「律師周大經」的銅照牌，也突然映上了我的眼簾。</p>
<p>當然「律師」兩個字，也不足引起我的驚奇：何况，那時的我，還是正大光明的一個普通朋友，更無驚奇的必要。</p>
<p>「我是朱近赤，天生的共產黨」丨我帶着滑稽的口吻，通了名之後，你們那一位以結婚爲失變的報復的周大律師，便極敏捷地打開門，迎出來了。</p>
<p>「近赤，是你！快進來！快進來！」他的熱烈而誠摯的歡迎，使我分外地感覺到舊雨重逢的快欒。那時候，我幾乎要摟住他接吻了！</p>
<p>接着，自然是「驀地相逢那風流寃孽」的一幕了。親愛的小朋友，你大槪也不曾忘記吧？</p>
<p>在淺綠色的燈泡所射出來的幽默甜靜的綠色的光芒之下，你，美得不能形容</p>
<p>的你，穿着一件淺綠色的春裝，落落大方地站在一條紫紅色的繡幕的旁邊。誘人的微笑，流利的眼波，美的輪廓；一切的一切，都像日本三八式自動小槍所發的子彈一樣快，一樣有力的直射到了我的心坎深處。</p>
<p>啊！天哪！就這三四秒鐘的一刹那，便斷定了我一生命運丨那是十三號，又是禮拜五眞是最不利的一個日子。我往後所受到的許多苦悶，煩惱，掙扎，失眠。以至於今天的出亡，都是這一個不利的日子所賜與我的禮物啊！</p>
<p>但是，我一些不怨恨牠而且還要感謝牠！因爲我已經從牠所給與我的機會上，取到了你的一顆鮮紅熱烈的心了。丨至少有半顆，這是我自已可以保證的！</p>

<p>國際要聞</p>
<h3>蘇聯電影事業之特殊性</h3>
<p>— 文印女士</p>
<p>蘇聯電影事業和其他諸國的電影事業有兩種顯然不同的特點：㈠</p>
<p>蘇聯的電影事業是國營的，自編劇本，訓練演員，攝影片以至分配放映都完全在國家的統　之下；蘇聯的電影事業並不是商業化的圖利的經營，而是一種廣汎的爲文化藝術的敎育活動。</p>
<p>在革命之初，蘇聯的革命領袖們老早就確認了電影在敎化上和藝術上有極偉大的意義。爲加强電影之敎育作用計，遂有一切影片的内容都必須經過了敎育人民委員部及政府的宣傳部審查的决定。無論那部影片，其内容莫不以敎化廣大的勞働者農民，引使向新的社會推進爲前提。政府就利用電影向人民大衆灌輸以一般的敎育和政治敎育，作關於新社會的及意識形態的廣泛的宣傳。在帝俄文化已被廢棄，新俄文化正在繼續生長的過期中，電影在大衆藝術之形成上，其作用亦格外顯得重要與偉大。和那將電影作爲消遣娱樂之一的因襲見解完全推反，蘇聯獨確認電影爲機械時代的藝術，而且更進一步確認其爲大衆的藝術，以之爲型造新社會大衆文化的動力。</p>
<p>因爲蘇聯的當局們確認了電影在敎化上藝術上之眞價與作用，所以遂有電影事業國營的决定·蘇聯電影國營之法令是在一九一九年八月二十七日由列寗簽字，由人民委員會公布的。在此以前，當革命政府初成立後之一九一八年二月，蘇聯之敎育人民委員部早已在列寗格勒和莫斯科設置了電影專門委員會，計劃當時的電影事業。自從國營法令公布之後，蘇聯的電影界遂起了和以前判然不同的方向轉換，其爲大衆文化爲大衆藝術而奮鬥的態度亦從此格外鮮明而堅决：蘇聯近年來電影事業之特殊的發展，亦即種因於此。這不但是蘇聯電影界之劃期的偉業，同時亦是世界電影界之一新的紀元。（本文取材於蘇聯年鑑）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>無線電播音大會</h3>
<p>— 燕南</p>
<p>派拉蒙本年度的「十大特種鉅片」，已經一半搬在上海的銀幕上了，十分之一的「無線電播音大會」ＴheＢigＢroadcast在美國輿論界，被推爲十片之首，丨以我個人看，也極端同情於這種論調的，</p>
<p>牠和「百老匯歌舞」「海上繁華夢」大同小異，但是更有趣，更有力得多，美國對於這種全部歌曲的片子，已經冷落多了，「派拉蒙進行曲」以後，我們再也看不見派拉蒙有這種影片；丨有丨就是這張了，不過很明顯的，這次有驚人的進步。</p>
<p>牠並不雷同於任何歌舞片；牠有複雜的情節，有巨量的歌曲，把很長的故事，盡力簡縮；而後半部，完全集中在歌曲上，全片的妙，就在那些歌曲；有情歌，有爵士歌，有悲壯的Ｃassic，有黑人的俚歌，全部有奇特應景的音欒，有時還穿挿着些蹕達舞，丨丨但是這種歌舞的優美，絕不是文字上所能描寫得出的！</p>
<p>一開幕，就拿一個無線電台作了中心；結果仍在那裏，更加了一幕兩雙情侶團圓的喜劇作收尾，前半部的述事，把劇情精彩的地方，盡量的發揮了，而三位演員，也表演得無孔不入！即使沒有歌舞，也夠得上說是一張「熱情佳作」，演員都是一些初上銀幕的人，但是竟會用奇巧的方法，來吿訴我們每人的名字，末一節的歌舞，又偏加上那經理的幾叚靜默表演，使全片不離本題，攝影佈景，一切都美術化得很，……總之，這一位導演，眞比劉别谦，地米爾，還高超些，</p>
<p>如果你平常喜歡看電影，或對於美國無線電放的歌曲，有相當的興趣：那末你寗可犧牲任何一千張影片，甚至賣了你的無線電，也應當看這一張無雙的佳作。！</p>

<h3>天一音樂主任馬陋芬</h3>
<p>— 小馬</p>
<p>天一小生馬陋芬，江蘇吳縣人；自幼生長滬上。年十五歲入光華大學附中，平日喜習音樂；如校中開游藝會，馬君都踴躍參加表演；校中同學敎員甚爲嘉奬。卒對之後，方十七歲；入現代歌曲家黎錦睴氏創辦之中華歌舞團爲音樂師，在滬地表演很能博得社會上的好評。</p>
<p>後隨黎氏到南洋羣島等地表演，也很受當地人士贊許；回國之時，已十八歲。</p>
<p>脫離黎氏之中華歌舞團，自辦天馬歌舞團；往厦門一帶表演，後入王惕予辦之集美歌舞團在滬寗一帶走遍了他的足跡。如是瞎混了三年之久。後由黎氏介紹入天一影片公司，天一老關邵醉翁很器重他，請他和陳玉梅合演了一部有聲影片「芸蘭姑娘」；成績還不差。馬君現在只有二十有三歲。</p>
<p>國片談薈</p>
<h3>（一）觀『三個摩登女性』後</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>聯華的『三個摩登女性』前天在新光試映了。我因一偶然的機會得去鑒賞。</p>
<p>「這是一部値得看的片子」，我開頭便要這樣說。那片子的結構是這樣的；仍然是一個戀愛的故事，三個不同階級的摩登，女性同時和一個男性發生戀愛。一個是上層社會的交際花；一個是中間階層惟愛主義的女子；一個是小布爾喬亞出身的電話女工。</p>
<p>故事穿插得相當完美，曲折，然同時也有「巧」的地方。導演卜萬蒼，在意識上或技巧上都有進步。</p>
<p>在表演的技巧上，可以說幾個重要角色都是相當的成功，尤其是阮玲玉，我承認她有着特殊的聰明。</p>
<p>陳燕燕正是那末天眞，那末純潔。黎灼灼也能代表那種典型人物。金𦦨仍保持往了他的�</p>
<p>成績。</p>
<p>有幾個好的塲面，如外灘苦力的寫實等，跳舞一塲欠高明，周淑　的飛吻破壞了一部份的情節。陳若英自殺太平凡。字幕欠完善，然亦有具有文字意味的。</p>
<p>最後，我的結語是；這是卜萬蒼成功的作品，雖然其中仍有些錯誤，可是「錯誤誰也會有的。只要我能充分的克服這錯誤」，我謹以這片中的幾句對話（字幕）贈給卜先生。</p>
<h3>（二）看「小女伶」後</h3>
<p>— 翊烈</p>

<h3>（三）對於「奮鬭」的一些意見</h3>
<p>— 琪溪</p>
<p>劇中「奮鬥」，的確是有「奮鬥」，但可惜不能「奮鬥」到底，小鄭加入義勇軍，參加作戰，如果這次戰事是說上海之戰，那末這回上海之戰，我們總算失敗了，所以我却願意小鄭戰死，却不願意小鄭生還。如果這次戰事是說黑水白山之戰，那現在還未到旋歸的時候。奮鬥是奮鬥到底的，而「奮鬥」所給與我們的是什麽呢？</p>
<p>在最後的兩幕，所暗示我們的，是：小鄭穿着義勇軍的制服，和他的人丨燕姑擁抱。…小鄭已換了西裝，和他的愛人泛舟。這些事實吿訴我們：小鄭爲國家奮鬥，并沒有徹底：同時爲愛情奮鬥，總算成功了。丨這就是我看「奮鬥」的最後結果。</p>

<h3>攝影場比作「太虚幻境」</h3>
<p>— 陳大悲</p>
<p>這種笑的練習方法，與你的健康是很有關係的。你如果决心要在表演藝術上繼續不斷的用功夫，你如果决心要在攝影塲裏建樹你的事業，你將來無論在心理方面或是生理方面都要忍受到許多痛苦，在别種職業裏所决不會嘗到的痛苦。</p>
<p>在從來沒有經歷過攝影場生活的朋友們僅僅由銀幕上窺見攝影塲中明的一面，便以爲攝影塲的生活是一種富於樂趣的理想生活。有些人看見了許多燦爛的明星，竟把攝影塲比作「太虚幻境」。這完全是錯誤了。</p>
<p>攝影塲裏男男女女的職演員們是和你在别種集團裏所遭遇的男男女女一樣的是血和肉造成的人。你在别種集團裏感覺到「小人」的數目比「君子」的數目多。在攝影塲裏也是一樣的。在學校生活中，新學生往往要受老學生的欺侮。在攝影塲裏當臨時演員或零星配角的時候，你所受的欺侮只怕比當新學生的時候還要多些。傲慢的神氣，譏諷的批評，甚至於粗鄙的呵斥和野蠻的謾駡，在今日中國的各攝影塲裏，差不多到處都可以使你一個新進的人感覺到侷促不安，和做童養媳的女孩子大惡姑面前差不多情形。</p>
<p>至於工作時間呢。攝影塲裏，無論在那一國，都是一樣的沒有所謂法定鐘點的。在那些靠太陽吃飯的小公司裏，你一天忙到晚，連吃飯的功夫都會發生問題的。在那些依賴電光的大公司裏你的工作時間可以一直延長到天明以後。看見黑籍的同伴們興致勃發的時候，你已經疲乏到腰痛背痛，只想躺下來了。</p>

<h3>The League of Nations' Small Nation Representatives Unanimously Endorse the Lytton Report</h3>
<p>Firmly Refuse to Recognize the So-Called Puppet State of Manchukuo</p>
<p>But Fail to Explicitly Denounce Japan's Violation of the Covenant</p>
<p>Japanese Side Spreads Rumors of Direct Sino-Japanese Negotiations</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Assembly Special Session continued its meeting at 3:40 PM today. Representatives from the four major powers—France, Britain, Italy, and Germany—spoke in succession, none making a clear judgment on right and wrong. However, they advocated for promoting reconciliation between China and Japan based on the Lytton Report. The French representative, Paul-Boncour, argued that the League of Nations should stipulate the general principles for Sino-Japanese negotiations. The British representative, Simon, stated that "We should consider the facts and promote a practical solution, hoping that both the United States and Russia can participate in the Special Committee of Nineteen." The Italian representative, Aloisi, advocated for international cooperation in China's reconstruction and supported Simon's proposal to invite the United States and Russia to participate. According to reporters' observations, the attitude of the major powers is clearly different from that of the small nations, as they are unwilling for the League of Nations to hastily impose sanctions on Japan. (Central News Agency dispatch of the 7th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Chinese representative, Quo Tai-chi, is scheduled to deliver a speech at the League of Nations Assembly tomorrow. Small nations are currently campaigning to pass two resolutions: one declaring Japan's violation of the Covenant and the other refusing to recognize Manchukuo. (Central News Agency dispatch of the 7th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Assembly continued its session at 3:00 PM on the 7th. After the speech by the Uruguayan representative, Borro, representatives from major powers, including the French Foreign Minister, Paul-Boncour, the British Foreign Secretary, Simon, as well as the Dutch representative, Moltesco, the Danish representative, Burbek, the German Foreign Minister, Neurath, and the Turkish representative, Hansupei, spoke in succession. Subsequently, the Chinese Minister to Britain, Quo Tai-chi, and the Japanese representative, Matsuoka, also made supplementary speeches. According to Chairman Hymans, the general debate may be completed tomorrow. (National News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Dr. Yen Hui-ching today submitted a telegram from Chiang Kai-shek to the League of Nations Assembly, denying rumors that Chiang supports direct Sino-Japanese negotiations. The Chinese delegation today also submitted a telegram from Su Bingwen to the Assembly, stating that on November 28th, six Japanese aircraft dropped several bombs at the Shiba Li Mu (transliteration) station on the Chinese Eastern Railway, causing casualties among the residents. (Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Before the League of Nations Assembly announced the opening of the meeting today (the 7th), the League Secretariat distributed a letter from Japan regarding the resurgence of the anti-Japanese movement in China to all member states. The letter falsely claimed that the anti-Japanese boycott movement had resurged due to the statement by the Chinese representative, Dr. Wellington Koo, at the Executive Yuan meeting, declaring the boycott legitimate. (National News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Representatives from various small countries, in their speeches at the General Assembly, expressed sympathy for our country, but failed to explicitly denounce Japan's violation of the Covenant. The Japanese side is still spreading rumors here about impending direct Sino-Japanese negotiations, hoping to confuse international public opinion. (Central News Agency dispatch of the 7th)</p>
<h3>The Spanish Representative Speaks from a Legal Standpoint</h3>
<p>Japan Disregards International Law and Order</p>
<p>The League of Nations' Procrastination Will Lead to Its Own Demise</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Extraordinary Assembly of the League of Nations convened at 11:00 AM on the 7th. Under the chairmanship of Foreign Minister Hymans, the meeting continued the general discussion on the Sino-Japanese dispute. The Spanish representative, Madariaga, delivered a speech, stating that he acknowledged the complexity and difficulty of the Sino-Japanese dispute, which he described as a conflict between national rationality and international rationality, with the latter potentially having a significant impact on the Japanese people. The Spanish representative praised the League of Nations, saying that it was greatly alarmed when the Manchurian Incident occurred and therefore adopted cautious, wise, and patient actions. He also stated that for every problem, if there is a sincere attempt to resolve it, then the process, even if slow, is acceptable. The task of the Assembly and the League of Nations is to end hostile acts and find a solution to the dispute, as well as to promote all the principles of the League of Nations. Before starting mediation, the League of Nations should first announce its opinion on past events so that mediation can proceed more easily, because a mediation plan must have a foundation and a clear position. Mediation must take into account the interests of the League of Nations; if the League of Nations abandons its responsibilities, it will bring about its own demise. Mediation must also take into account the interests of Japan, because Japan's permanent interests are actually consistent with the interests of the League of Nations. Madariaga also stated that the Spanish government fully accepts the findings and conclusions of the Lytton Commission of Inquiry. The Spanish representative concluded, "The permanent Japan and the historical Japan should learn a lesson from this matter, namely that, at least in terms of method, our opinions are indeed different from those of present-day Japan. What the world needs is order, but order is not about military uniforms or soldiers. The so-called order is none other than rules and legal principles." He also said, "We must uphold legal principles, believe in legal principles, and affirm legal principles." After Madariaga finished speaking, the Chairman invited the Swiss representative, Motta, to speak. (Havas dispatch of the 7th)</p>
<h3>The Swiss Representative Speaks from a Moral Perspective</h3>
<p>The Swiss representative, Motta, took the floor and was met with thunderous applause. Motta said that he did not wish to openly criticize any of the two major countries involved in the dispute, as Switzerland maintains excellent relations with both. He only wished to speak in defense of the League of Nations Covenant. The Council referred the case to the Assembly in order to allow each member to freely express its views on the dispute and the Lytton Report. The Lytton Report is an excellent document that enhances the prestige of the drafters and the League of Nations. What steps will the League of Nations take after this debate? In his opinion, the Special Committee of Nineteen should propose and supervise a reconciliation procedure. He hoped that this could be achieved, thus avoiding the need to apply Article 15, Paragraph 4 of the Covenant. Was Japan's action a legitimate act of self-defense? The Lytton Report has already provided an unambiguous answer. Did Japan have any intention of military conquest in implementing its expansionist policy? The Lytton Report also has an answer to this. Without Japanese troops, the new state could not be established, but the Inquiry also stated that restoring the status quo is impossible. Motta then referred to the reasons cited by the Japanese for not seeking the League of Nations' assistance, saying that the Japanese reasons contradict Articles 10 and 12. No country should act arbitrarily; this is an essential element for the success of world peace. We have complete sympathy for both countries. We hope for friendly solutions not only on existing disputes, but also on all issues. In short, Japan has overstepped its rights. If Japan accepts the authority of the League of Nations, it will truly enhance its honor and greatly contribute to the strength of morality and the dignity of conscience. (Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Greek Representative Takes the Opportunity to Complain</h3>
<p>The Greek representative, Politis, took the floor amidst applause. He said that after listening to the speeches this morning, he did not wish to say much more. The League of Nations had resolved the Shanghai Incident, thereby increasing its prestige. Now there is also the issue of the Three Eastern Provinces awaiting resolution, which is far more difficult than the Shanghai Incident. Fortunately, the Lytton Report has pointed the way forward for this situation, so this book is a tool for finding a final solution. The main issue before the Assembly now is the issue of legitimate self-defense. Self-defense is the right of any country, and immediate plans should be adopted to protect oneself when harmed. As for what the Japanese call legitimate self-defense, from the perspective of international law, the Lytton Report speaks very clearly on this point. If Japan cannot provide evidence to refute it, then the Lytton Report will naturally govern the decision of the Assembly. Politis then recounted an old case from 1925 involving a dispute between Greece and Bulgaria. At that time, Greece accepted the decision of the Council and agreed to pay compensation. Japan in this dispute has indeed been subjected to provocative actions, such as unilateral treaty abrogations and boycotts. But was this danger truly so great that Japan could dispense with seeking the League of Nations' intervention? Although Matsuoka has presented the reasons why Japan did not request the League of Nations to handle the matter, he felt that Japan should at least test the League of Nations' ability to intervene. He did not wish to doubt the sincerity of Japan's will and belief, but he believed that the Assembly's responsibility was to declare the fallacy of Japan's theory. Therefore, there is still hope for the situation, and he believes that the Assembly can still find a basis for friendly resolution and avoid the need to apply Article 15, Paragraph 4. (Reuters)</p>
<p>The representatives of the United States of Central America (Guatemala?)  [Note: "中美瓜地瑪拉代表馬都" probably refers to representative of the U.S. of Central America. Guatemala used to be part of a union called United Provinces of Central America or the United States of Central America.] and Madu spoke after Politis, saying that the anxiety of small countries about the Sino-Japanese dispute arises from the principles involved. The government he represents supports the principles contained in the League of Nations Covenant and believes that the Lytton Report should be the basis for all actions of the League of Nations. He is prepared to do his best to support the Lytton Report, and the Guatemalan government advocates for the respect of treaties.</p>
<p>After Madu finished speaking, the Assembly announced the adjournment of the meeting and scheduled a continuation at 3:30 PM this afternoon.</p>
<h3>The French Representative, Paul-Boncour's Speech Lacks Clarity</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Assembly continued its meeting at 3:40 PM this afternoon. First, the Uruguayan representative, Dr. Borro, spoke, stating that the purpose of his speech was to assist all the powers of the League of Nations and that he supported the establishment of a committee to study ways to find a solution to the dispute.</p>
<p>The French representative, Paul-Boncour, then spoke, saying that the League of Nations is easily criticized. Some believe that its handling of matters is slow and that what applies to the Far East dispute may also apply to future European conflicts. Those who hold this view will realize their mistake in this dispute. The situation is unusual. What we must not forget is that one of the parties in the dispute has the right to station troops in the other country. France, within the League of Nations, is willing to participate in any plan that can restore peace. A year ago, on December 10th, under the chairmanship of Briand, the League of Nations passed a resolution that became the fundamental principle of the Covenant and was attached to a declaration that was not only passed by the Council but also recognized by both parties. Thus, the Inquiry was established, and now its report is being considered. This report is divided into two parts: one for recognition and inspection, and one for conclusions and recommendations. For our benefit, our work should be based on this recognition and recommendations. Before the Assembly, there are two stages: one is conciliation, and on this point, he felt that the smallest basis should be expressed first, so that the conciliation process does not go beyond its scope, and one is that in the future there may be a need to proceed in accordance with Article 15, Paragraph 4. He believed that the report has indicated the best way in which a conciliation procedure can be applied, namely direct discussions between the two parties. The current debate has not yet shown the impressions of both parties regarding the conclusions of the Lytton Report. He believes that it is necessary to have close and detailed discussions on each point separately. This is essential for the initial conciliation procedure. Paul-Boncour's speech lacked clarity and was criticized by many. The British Foreign Secretary, Simon, spoke after Paul-Boncour. The text repeatedly mentioned Article 15, Paragraph 4 of the Covenant, the original text of which is recorded below: If the dispute cannot be resolved in this way, the Council, by a vote of all or a majority, shall issue a report stating the facts of the dispute and the recommendations that the Council deems appropriate.</p>
<h3>The Situation of the Meeting the Day Before Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Special Assembly of the League of Nations continued its meeting at 3:45 PM on the afternoon of the 6th. The representatives of Ireland, Connolly, Sweden, Eden, and the Czech Foreign Minister, Benes, successively expressed their views as follows:</p>
<h3>The South Irish Representative Cries Out Loudly That If the League of Nations Is Timid and Does Not Move Forward, Itself Will Have No Way to Survive</h3>
<p>(Geneva) When the League of Nations Assembly continued its meeting this afternoon, the Irish representative, Connolly, first spoke, saying that the Lytton Report and the actions that the Assembly can take in this regard not only relate to China and Japan but also to the future of the League of Nations itself. The major issue of war and peace in the Far East and its inevitable impact on world peace are all closely linked to the resolution of the report. He said this not to exaggerate; the Assembly must make a fair judgment based on the facts and seek a solution that is equal to all parties concerned in order to eliminate this conflict and the possibility of future enmity. Many critics believe that the League of Nations is incapable of handling major issues. He and many people in Ireland also held this view, but since he arrived in Geneva, he has begun to feel that the League of Nations has the utmost power to maintain world peace in its constitution. However, the League of Nations must be prepared to earnestly and bravely safeguard the League of Nations Covenant and its own decisions. If it retreats or is apprehensive and concerned about offending people, then the League of Nations cannot survive and is not worth surviving. The Lytton Report has found several signs that the Assembly should pay attention to. The most obvious is that the report seems to have indicated that Japan, in order to seek its own interests, is using imperialist expansion methods and completely disregards the infringement of the territorial rights of another sovereign state. What is undeniable is that the activities of Japan in establishing and maintaining "Manchukuo" cannot be ignored. The concerns of the world that Japanese officials will eventually completely manage "Manchukuo" are not without reason. The report has clearly stated that Japan has indeed committed actions that violate the League of Nations Covenant, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Nine-Power Treaty. Due to these violations, "Manchukuo" has been established. Among the conclusions of the Lytton Report, it is said that restoring the status quo will not solve the problem, and maintaining and recognizing "Manchukuo" is not a satisfactory solution because it disregards the wishes of the people of Manchuria and it is doubtful whether it will benefit Japan's ultimate interests. In his view, this section is the key point of the situation, and the phrase "whether it will benefit Japan's ultimate interests" is particularly important. Japan's real interests in Manchuria are acknowledged and must be given due consideration. However, protecting these interests by peaceful means is more solid than using force. He hoped that the Assembly would agree with him, and he hoped that Japan, after thinking about it, would also agree. Now that the Lytton Report is placed before us, if we are not prepared to deny the conclusions, the countries attending this meeting must declare their refusal to recognize "Manchukuo." If we want to maintain the integrity of the League of Nations, he sees no other way to do it. Japan may say that Japan has sacrificed lives and money to consolidate its position in Manchuria. However, in the world's "wars to end all wars," millions of lives have been lost and billions of dollars have been spent, and the only result is that the world is confused and disoriented and is in a state of social and economic turmoil. The League of Nations was born out of this war, and what it maintains in the world depends only on a thread of treaty. We must not allow anyone to cut this thread. What small countries pay the most attention to is that the principles of the League of Nations Covenant must be firmly maintained. If the moral strength of the League of Nations is broken on this point, how can the existing League of Nations survive? The Lytton Report expresses the idea that the establishment of a local police force in Manchuria may be the basis for a final solution. This point can also be noted. Japan must know that if it insists on its current attitude, it will cause Japan to be despised. If Japan refuses to comply with the conditions of the League of Nations Covenant, it will lose goodwill and commercial relations. However, the responsibility of the League of Nations Assembly to maintain the method of applying the Covenant at any cost does not diminish because of this. If the Japanese people find it difficult to understand this view, it is truly a pity. The Irish Free State is extremely opposed to the idea of imperialist expansion. He felt that the Assembly should earnestly accept the Lytton Report. He, on behalf of the South Irish government, accepts it without hesitation. As far as the Irish Free State is concerned, it will adopt the recommendations of the Lytton Commission of Inquiry and refuse to recognize any new country established in Manchuria in its current state. Now that South Ireland has made this declaration in earnest, it is also willing to contribute its possible assistance to seek a solution based on the Lytton Report.</p>
<h3>The Czech Foreign Minister Speaks Eloquently</h3>
<p>Sincerely Uphold the Dignity of the League of Nations Covenant</p>
<p>Maintain Peace and Forbid Lenience Towards Japan</p>
<p>The Czech Foreign Minister, Dr. Benes, then spoke, mentioning the importance of this issue, saying that since the establishment of the League of Nations, the Assembly has been convened to act under Article 15 of the Covenant. This is the first time that a final and effective solution to the issue or a measure involving arbitration may be involved. This issue concerns the whole world, the area involved is larger than the combined area of France and Germany, and the country involved has more people than the total number of residents elsewhere on the planet, and in political, economic, and spiritual terms, it involves the other two major countries which are not members of the League of Nations. What the Czech Republic is concerned about is purely a matter of principle, because the Czech Republic wishes to maintain the most friendly relations with both parties to this case. He did not wish to rush to a judgment on this conflict. There are things that must be determined first: Has the obligation of the Covenant been violated? Have the obligations of the various international conventions been respected by both parties? Have the resolutions of the Council and the Assembly been observed by both parties? Has the League of Nations handled this issue with a non-hasty or impartial attitude, or with the spirit of perseverance and justice? This is the most important issue for the League of Nations, because it will set a precedent. He has said a lot about the issue of principle. Now please allow him to speak about the issue of fact. He advocates passing the Lytton Report. This book is a valuable, solemn, and very fair document. The report has stated that Japan's military actions in Manchuria and Shanghai cannot be recognized as acts of legitimate self-defense. This directly states that the land of a member of the League of Nations has been invaded by Japan. In this case, no other conclusion is possible, unless the League of Nations Covenant has not been respected by Japan. There is also a situation where if there is a question of legitimate self-defense, it must be based on the other party's misconduct. Based on the Lytton Report and the documents submitted by both parties, there are two types of behaviors that may be of this nature: one is the boycott propaganda, which even extends to schools, and the other is the organized, systematic, and seemingly promoted by the authorities anti-Japanese boycott movement. This type of behavior is of course reprehensible, but if a member state of the League of Nations arbitrarily carries out large-scale military actions on the land of another member state, then the League of Nations must take firm action. In the final resolution, the allegations regarding anti-foreignism and anti-boycott should be given serious consideration. The Czech representative mentioned the issue of the creation of "Manchukuo", saying that this also involves issues of principle, etc., and is more serious. Within the land of a member state of the League of Nations, an independent country is established due to the presence of the military of another member state. May I ask if this is not a clear violation of Article 10 of the League of Nations Covenant? Is this not a very dangerous precedent? What would you think if the same situation occurred in Europe? Preventing the establishment of a precedent is critical. If other countries follow suit, the consequences will be unimaginable. As a guarantor of respect for treaties, if a country does not respect the Nine-Power Treaty, is the League of Nations not concerned about it? What must be acknowledged now is that the responsibility for not complying with certain treaty obligations is now also placed on other parties. The Special Committee of Nineteen has expressed its regret that the commitment by both parties not to aggravate the situation has not been fulfilled. What is even more disappointing to the Special Committee is that Japan's recognition of "Manchukuo" has made the mediation work extremely difficult. Particularly serious actions that are contrary to the League of Nations Covenant and the provisions of the Assembly resolutions have occurred. This unfair behavior must be justified. In any case, the League of Nations cannot recognize it. This is obvious regarding the resolution of March 11th of this year. Before we begin to proceed based on Article 15, Paragraph 4 of the Covenant, please do not create a situation that forces us to act as judges. Japan has a glorious history and occupies a position among the world's first-class countries. China has an ancient civilization and is the source of the progressive aspirations of today's emerging countries. We ask these two countries to seek a solution to their conflict through sincere, faithful, and friendly mediation. Even if this effort fails despite our assistance, the League of Nations' work will then be to adjudicate. The League of Nations must have the courage to act without reservation or hesitation, firmly and solemnly, and in accordance with the public interest. The Assembly cannot take ambiguous actions on issues involving principles. Even if it cannot obtain an immediate and effective solution, there should be no doubt about the Assembly's firm will.</p>
<h3>The Swedish Representative Speaks Candidly</h3>
<p>Firmly Uphold the Lytton Report</p>
<p>Severely Denounce Japan's Support for the Puppet State of Manchukuo</p>
<p>The Swedish representative, Eden, then spoke, saying that the current relationship between China and Japan is actually a disguised war. All actions that do not respect treaties will cause major disputes in international relations. International constraints must never be disregarded by the selfish actions of any single country. This approach can never be recognized. The responsibility of the Assembly is to decide whether the violation of the treaty is a legitimate act of self-defense. The Lytton Report already has a clear answer to this. The Japanese side said that the situation in Manchuria has changed due to the establishment of the new independent "Manchukuo." However, the Lytton Report said that the establishment of the new state was due to the Japanese military's occupation of the Three Eastern Provinces. The Assembly should base its arguments on the Lytton Report when passing resolutions. When the Assembly passed a resolution on March 3 of this year, the Assembly stated that the actions of the Japanese military in the Three Eastern Provinces had indeed infringed on the territorial integrity of another member of the League of Nations. Therefore, recognizing "Manchukuo" is an act that violates Article 10 of the Covenant. If negotiations to resolve the dispute are to be conducted at this time, the situation is very inappropriate. Since the League of Nations cannot order the troops of one party to withdraw from the territory of the other party, all negotiations will be conducted under military pressure. This is contrary to the spirit of the Covenant. The current situation is extremely dangerous, so the Assembly should not suspend discussions before deciding on a solution.</p>
<h3>The Norwegian Representative Speaks Righteously</h3>
<p>Opposes Any Kind of Militarism</p>
<p>China and Japan Should Be Peacefully Mediated</p>
<p>Afterwards, the Norwegian representative, Lange, stood up and spoke, first saying that the Assembly had allowed the extension of the period for discussion to be extended due to special circumstances. He then praised the Lytton Commission of Inquiry, saying that the Lytton Report was extremely fair and that the best way for the Assembly to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute was to adopt the Lytton Report's proposals. He also stated that he was absolutely opposed to any country acting arbitrarily and disregarding everything. Lange then continued, saying that historically, there have been many cases of land being seized by force, but now there is the existence of the League of Nations Covenant and other arbitration treaties, so there are better methods of mediation than military occupation. He also mentioned the resolution of March 11 and said that he hoped that China and Japan could work hard to find a method of mediation with the assistance of all member states of the League of Nations, and that all countries with interests in the Far East would be willing to participate and work together with the League of Nations, and that this effort would not only be limited to expressing opinions and interpreting treaties but would also seek to achieve the purpose of resolving the issue. China and Japan are actually interdependent. Japan may have grievances, but a way to mediate the interests of both parties in the Three Eastern Provinces cannot fail to be found.</p>
<p>The Assembly adjourned at 5:55 PM. The next meeting is scheduled for Wednesday morning at 10:45 AM, at which time representatives from Spain, Switzerland, and Greece will speak. (Reuters dispatch of the 6th)</p>
<h3>Lord Lytton's Speech at a London Banquet</h3>
<p>Hoping Japan Will Not Take Actions to Undermine the League of Nations</p>
<p>(London) Tonight, the League of Nations Society held a banquet, attended by personnel from both the Chinese and Japanese embassies. Lord Lytton, in an impromptu speech, stated that the current situation is no longer merely an abstract or legal issue, but rather concerns the actions of individuals. It is now understood that the underlying issue is always one of people. When asked if there was any hope for a resolution, Lytton replied that his initial impression of last week's League of Nations Council meeting was that there was little progress. However, he later realized that the Council meeting was not a waste of time. If both parties in the Council meeting had expressed their acceptance of the report and were willing to use it as a starting point for new negotiations, the Council would have welcomed such a statement and forwarded the report to the Assembly with a proposal to begin negotiations immediately. Although this was not the case, there was still cause for comfort. Thus, the Assembly held its meeting in a spirit of hope. The League of Nations only asks two things of Japan: first, that Japan has full confidence in the League and is certain that it will not be forced to abandon any interests it considers vital; and second, that Japan expresses its willingness to ensure that its vital interests do not conflict with the equally important interests of other countries. Some believe that a solution can be achieved simply with Japan's agreement, but in fact, China's agreement is also necessary. Neither side desires our praise or criticism, but rather to be understood and trusted by us. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>Chairman Lord Cecil spoke, discussing the League of Nations Assembly, saying he hoped the solution determined by the Assembly would conform to the principles of law and fairness that the League upholds among its member states. As for each country's right to judge its own disputes, that is completely inapplicable to civilized international life today. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<h3>Matsuoka Consults Secretly Late at Night</h3>
<p>Secret Talk with Herriot</p>
<p>Rehashing the Franco-Japanese Alliance</p>
<p>(Geneva) British Prime Minister MacDonald, who went to Geneva, returned to England at 10:40 PM today. Before returning to Paris, French Prime Minister Herriot met secretly with Japanese representative Matsuoka at 10:17 PM this afternoon for a long discussion. The content of the discussion remains secret. According to Japanese sources, because the Five-Power Naval Conference is about to break down, France has agreed to reconsider carefully the Franco-Japanese alliance proposed by Japan.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>After the Opening of the League of Nations Assembly: Prospects Dim</h3>
<p>1. China's Hope</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, our government has exercised restraint and caution, prioritizing the maintenance of peace and avoiding the reckless initiation of hostilities. Therefore, even though three northeastern provinces have been lost, our people have responded to the opponent's aggression with only peaceful and temperate resistance. At the same time, we have placed full trust in the League of Nations, even though its resolutions have been trampled upon time and again. The League of Nations Covenant, the Washington Nine-Power Treaty, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact have all been torn apart by Japan's iron fist. "Public justice" and "righteousness" have all been reduced to mud under the iron hooves of militarism. The 3,776,700 square miles of land in the three northeastern provinces have been ravaged, and more than 30,080,000 people have become prisoners of the Japanese. Although our entire nation is filled with "indignation and hatred towards the enemy," we remain courteous and respectful. Therefore, since Japan launched its unprovoked military campaign, our country has not severed diplomatic relations with Japan, and envoys continue to travel back and forth as before. This clearly demonstrates the sincerity of our government and people in upholding peace and trusting the League of Nations.</p>
<p>With the opening of the special session of the League of Nations Assembly on the 6th of this month, our representatives will once again exert their eloquence to negotiate among the nations, hoping for the revival of public justice and righteousness. Furthermore, we hope that the League of Nations can uphold its original intention in establishing the League and, for the sake of bolstering the League's prestige, make an impartial judgment. If mediation has failed and conciliation is in vain, and if the Japanese military aggression continues unabated, not only will our country suffer losses, but world peace will also be adversely affected. Now that the entire case has been transferred to the Assembly for resolution, the only option is to immediately apply the provisions of Article 16 of the Covenant. The member states of the League of Nations should "immediately sever all commercial or financial relations with (Japan, which is engaging in warfare) and prevent all intercourse between their nationals and the nationals of the covenant-breaking State." More importantly, "the Council of the League shall recommend to the several Governments concerned what effective military, naval or air force the Members of the League shall severally contribute to the armed forces to be used to protect the covenants of the League." Otherwise, the last opportunity to test the credibility of the League of Nations will be lost forever.</p>
<p>2. Japan's Strategy</p>
<p>From the beginning of its invasion of the Northeast, Japan's underlying intention was to seize our country's territory. Therefore, it blatantly claimed that "China is not a modern and organized state" in order to arbitrarily divide it. In the diplomatic arena, it constantly hinted that it was assuming the first line of defense against Russia in the Far East and touted the high-sounding slogan of "Open Door in Manchuria." At the same time, it eagerly sought to cozy up to the Soviet Union, adding to the fisheries agreement and the petroleum agreement, and ordered Hirota (former ambassador to the Soviet Union) to return to Japan to carefully devise a plan. Matsuoka went to Moscow to carefully examine the Soviet Union's true intentions, believing that if a genuine understanding could be established between Japan and the Soviet Union, then Japan's annexation of the three northeastern provinces would not become a problem. However, the Soviet Union remained cautiously observant and would not be fooled by Japan. Before launching the Mukden Incident, Japan had made various preparations and claimed to have a tacit understanding with France. Japan did not fully trust the experienced and prudent British, but wanted to enlist France as its ally. However, with the recent signing of the Franco-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact and the resurgence of the American war debt issue, France, in order to maintain its hegemony in Europe, had eased its conflicts with the Soviet Union and was facing a renewed tension in its relations with Germany and Italy. Therefore, it had to seek understanding from the United States, and its support for Japan had to fade. With Japan and the United States being mutually incompatible, and its relationship with the Soviet Union being only temporary, Japan's pursuit remained focused on France. Recently, it even openly signaled that if France could assist Japan in the League of Nations Assembly by supporting its demand to recognize "Manchuria as a fait accompli" and promoting direct negotiations between China and Japan, Japan would do its utmost to support France's proposed new arms reduction plan to ensure France's "security." Furthermore, it could assist France in its state-owned enterprises advancing northward from Annam. However, what will actually happen will depend on the direction the world takes. However, France is too far from the Far East, its interests are minimal, and it cannot obtain the benefits of the Chinese Eastern Railway as desired. Therefore, its goodwill towards Japan may be limited to mere formalities.</p>
<p>3. The Outcome of the League of Nations Assembly</p>
<p>Although our country strongly upholds justice, unfortunately, its strength is too weak to support justice with force. As a result, Japan's arrogance has increased. The League of Nations, in this situation, should not favor Japan simply because our strength is weak. However, how to make Japan submit is the current question. The League of Nations is currently busy with disarmament and mending the rifts in Europe, and it is difficult to attend to the Far Eastern problem and lacks the power to enforce its will. Moreover, it fears Japan's firm opposition. Therefore, as for how the League of Nations Assembly will handle the Northeast issue in the future, I believe that there are three possible scenarios:</p>
<p>First, the member states of the League of Nations (especially the smaller countries) are all aware of Japan's conspiracy and believe that it must be restrained. Therefore, they advocate for the formation of a powerful mediation committee that includes the United States and the Soviet Union to compel Japan to submit.</p>
<p>Second, no resolution is made for the time being, and the "Manchukuo (puppet) state" is not recognized. Instead, the situation will be observed and allowed to develop. This is because discerning people in various countries believe that Japan cannot occupy the Northeast for long and will fall into difficulties due to financial collapse, eventually returning to the framework of the League of Nations.</p>
<p>Third, the League of Nations serves as a mediator to facilitate direct negotiations between China and Japan to restore the balance of power in the Far East.</p>
<p>Of the above three, the first and third are strongly opposed by Japan, and the chances of their realization are probably slim. Will "delaying" and "observing" be the trend of the future?</p>

The special task force of the first and second brigades of Su's troops went to Station 86 and handed over their weapons to the Russians for safekeeping. Su and his entourage are staying at Great Ouli. The return route has not been determined. The Peiping authorities have sent personnel to express their condolences to their families in Peiping and have telegraphed Mo Dehui, asking him to negotiate with the Russian side to protect the safety of Su and others. If Su's return route involves taking a ship from Vladivostok, there may be problems. Alternatively, he may go directly through Russia, passing through the Mongolian border and Linyi to Rehe.

<p>Mostly Irrelevant Remarks</p>

This was the statement made by Karakhan, the chairman of the Soviet Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to the Japanese representative in Moscow. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has instructed the representative to propose to Karakhan that Japan, "Manchukuo," and Soviet Russia should cooperate in various border areas to maintain security and avoid unfortunate incidents. It is said that Karakhan's response was irrelevant. It is not yet known whether Japan will station a large army in Manchuria Station.

<p>(Nanjing) The Guangdong Committee, due to rumors that the Third Plenary Session would change the central organization, restore the powers of the Chairman of the National Government to the pre-First Plenary Session, and restore the Central Political Council chairmanship, did not send representatives to attend in Nanjing. This matter was discussed at the Central Political Council meeting on the 7th.

It was decided to submit this matter to the Central Standing Committee for handling. Regarding the issue of the President of the Executive Yuan, Song Ziwen stated at the Central Political Council today that his term as acting President would last until the Third Plenary Session is convened. At the same time, Wang also telegraphed from Germany, stating that he was living far overseas, his sick body still needed rest, and he earnestly hoped that the collective decision would approve his resignation from the position of President of the Executive Yuan to avoid adding to his faults. The Central Government has now decided to change next Monday's Central Standing Committee roundtable to a Central Political Council meeting in order to decide on various issues related to the Third Plenary Session.

<h3>The Fierce Resistance of Deng Tiemei's Troops</h3>
<p>Mingcheng Gained and Lost Again</p>
<p>(Peiping) On the 12th of last month, Deng Tiemei's troops, including the Cai, Li, and Zhao regiments, and the martial arts team, attacked Mingcheng County. They advanced in four directions and engaged in fierce battles with the Japanese and rebel forces for four hours. The martial arts team fiercely attacked the southern route, and the enemy was routed. Fourteen Japanese soldiers and two puppet self-defense police were killed, and more than ten were wounded. The righteous army suffered more than ten casualties. Mingcheng was then occupied. However, due to a lack of defensive weapons, they retreated to their original defenses. On the 15th, more than 600 Japanese and rebel troops attacked and were repelled by Deng's troops. On the morning of the 16th, more than 400 Japanese reinforcements arrived, bringing the total to more than 1,000, and they attacked with great intensity. While the two sides were locked in a stalemate, Deng led more than 1,000 reinforcements to the rescue.

<p>The National Consultative Assembly Regulations Have Not Yet Been Drafted</p>
<h3>Drafting Committee Members Disagree</h3>
<p>Whether to Submit to the Third Plenary Session for Discussion Is Undecided</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Consultative Assembly was originally named the National Representative Assembly, which was approved by the Luoyang National Crisis Conference. After detailed review by the Central Government, the name was changed to the National Consultative Assembly. Chen Guofu, Gu Mengyu, Chen Gongbo, Zhu Jiahua, Duan Xipeng, Luo Jialun, Zhang Daofan, Tang Youren, Ye Chucang, and other nine people were appointed as members of the regulations drafting committee. Before Wang left the country, he also participated in the discussion of this meeting. Several meetings have been held, but the opinions of all parties have been inconsistent, and the matter has been delayed until now. It is heard that the opinions of the drafting members have recently been summarized as follows: 1. The national representatives of the National Consultative Assembly will be produced by popular elections in each province, selecting three times the number of representatives. From these three times the number of candidates, the Central Government will then designate the representatives. 2. The powers of the Consultative Assembly. In the early stages of democratic politics, civil rights are not yet fully realized. The Central Government should first implement a flexible measure to promote civil rights, namely, to expand the nature of the Central Political Council and form it into a Senate like those in European and American countries. This will make the nature of the National Consultative Assembly resemble the House of Representatives in European and American countries. In this way, in the initial period of the Consultative Assembly, the final decision on all political programs will temporarily remain with the Central Political Council, which is the political center. The main point of the failure to pass the organizational regulations is that the boundary between the assembly and the Central Government cannot be clarified. Because the Consultative Assembly is the initial implementation of democratic politics, its responsibility should be to represent the people and offer opinions to the Central Government in principle. All issues that are closely related to the functions and powers of the Central National Government, which the Central Government itself cannot resolve, may be discussed and decided by the Consultative Assembly. Conversely, the Central Political Council may also decide. The significance of this point is that some people argue that the responsibility of the Consultative Assembly is limited to offering opinions to the Central Government. The above points have not yet been fully determined by all parties. It is still difficult to predict whether the case will be submitted to the Third Plenary Session and, if so, whether it will be included in the agenda. (Special Dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry and Commerce Sends Personnel to Investigate Rural Economy</h3>

<h3>Yangtze River Hydropower Plant Site Determined</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The site of the Yangtze River Hydropower Plant is currently being surveyed by Zhao Ruizhi, a hydropower expert from the Construction Commission, S. Elstrup, chief engineer of the Yangtze River Conservancy Commission, Song Xishang, director of the Public Works Department, and other technical personnel in Sichuan. Yesterday, Song said that the survey results indicated that two locations, one 45 miles east of Yichang and the other 20 miles above Yichang, are the most suitable, as they have average water flow strength and are located on plains, facilitating industrial development. The designed power plant has a generating capacity of 320,000 kilowatts. Due to considerations for transportation and flooding, the project is relatively large and will require more than ten million yuan and three years to complete. All detailed plans and charts are currently being expedited by the Yangtze River Conservancy Commission and will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval in one month. (7th Dispatch)</p>

<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Lodges a Strong Protest Against the Japanese Army's Massacre of Farmers in Fushun</p>
<h3>The Japanese Government Actually Sends a Note to Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs Denying It</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the case of the Japanese army luring villagers, men, women, old, and young, in Pingdingshan, Qianjinzai, Lizigou, and other places in Fushun and mowing them down with machine guns, resulting in the tragic death of over 2,700 people, the Japanese government actually sent a note to our Ministry of Foreign Affairs denying it after our side announced it. They also regarded the news published in the Shanghai News as damaging the "reputation of the Imperial Army" and demanded a ban. It is heard that the government has already investigated the aforementioned massacre and has complete and conclusive evidence, recognizing that this kind of action is truly inhumane and has attracted the attention of the world. On the 6th, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs specially responded to the Japanese ambassador, not only refuting the note but also lodging a strong protest. The general meaning is as follows: The evidence in this case is conclusive and cannot be denied with empty words. The Japanese army has illegally occupied the three northeastern provinces for more than a year, and there has hardly been a day without incidents of killing, abusing, and oppressing people in that area. Countless of our people have died tragically or been injured by Japanese guns, cannons, aircraft, and bombs, and the loss of property they have suffered is also unprecedented. At the beginning of this year, the Japanese army, navy, and air force dared to arbitrarily attack Chinese residents with the latest weapons in Shanghai, a center of international commerce in China, resulting in countless deaths and injuries, and setting fire to houses and prohibiting extinguishing them. Their cruelty and ruthlessness have reached this point. Now, the Japanese army has wantonly massacred more than 2,700 Chinese farmers in Pingdingshan and other villages near Fushun, without sparing even women and children. This is truly a rare occurrence in human history. Not only are the Chinese people extremely angry, but people all over the world are also shocked by it. Regarding the so-called "damage to the reputation of the Imperial Army," the Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded in the note that the Chinese government believes that the best way for the Japanese government to maintain the reputation of the Japanese army is to initially prevent the Japanese army from illegally occupying the three northeastern provinces and attacking Shanghai, and not to order the killing of people. Now, it should quickly withdraw all the Japanese troops illegally occupying the eastern provinces. However, the Japanese government does not do this, and often distorts the facts or denies the facts after the Japanese army carries out aggression by force. In reality, it is only sufficient to expose the responsibilities that the Japanese government should bear. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated at the end of the note that the evidence for the Japanese army's massacre of farmers in villages near Fushun is conclusive, as mentioned above, and it is difficult to tolerate the attempt to deny it with empty words. In addition to reserving all rights regarding this case, a strong protest is hereby lodged. (7th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>President Hoover's Policy Report to Joint Session of U.S. Congress</p>
<h3>War Debt Issue Under Negotiation with Debtor Nations; U.S. Banking System Must Be Greatly Reformed</h3>
<p>International Cooperation to Solve Economic Problems</p>
<p>▲ The National News Agency, Washington, 7th - Today, the U.S. Congress specially convened a joint session of the Senate and House of Representatives to listen to President Hoover read out his annual policy report. The content mainly focused on domestic issues. Regarding war debts, the description was quite brief, only stating that the government is currently engaged in negotiations with debtor nations, and will make a special report to Congress once the negotiations are completed. However, his wording was quite capable of making members of Congress feel that they could not take this matter lightly.</p>
<h3>World Economic Conference</h3>
<p>He spoke quite earnestly about the domestic and international economic situation, guaranteeing that after the World Economic Conference is successful, it will be possible to raise prices. Therefore, he earnestly urged international cooperation to solve economic problems, stating that the welfare of our people is tied to the peace of the world, the disarmament of the world, and the recovery of the world economy. However, these problems can only be solved if each party has sincere friendship, abides by the agreements it has made, until they are mutually revised, and then adds international cooperation, determined to seek mutually beneficial solutions. We are preparing to hold a World Economic Conference, which, if successful, will greatly increase the prices of agricultural products, promote industry and commerce, and reduce unemployment. We are actively engaged in the World Disarmament Conference, which, if successful, will reduce the burden of taxation, increase political stability, and reduce the risk of war because it will increase the defense capabilities of various countries and reduce the aggressive capabilities of various countries.</p>
<h3>Financial Revenue and Expenditure</h3>
<p>As for domestic affairs, he also advocated adopting a universal sales tax, greatly reducing salaries, improving banking laws, and reducing services for veterans, declaring that the budget for the coming year must seek a balance between revenue and expenditure. The way to increase revenue is to expand the scope of taxation. In practice, a sales tax should be levied on all manufactured goods, but this tax must be levied uniformly, and only food and certain clothing can be exempted. However, most members of both houses of Congress seemed to pay little attention to the president's proposal for a sales tax. Next, he discussed the issue of salary reductions, saying that the 500 million yuan saved in last year's budget was because the economy was declining and the people's livelihood was declining. The government had to increase services to the public, resulting in many unexpected expenses, which consumed most of what was originally intended to be saved last year. However, at a time when public and private finances are in trouble, the government must strive to be thrifty. He has drafted a salary reduction plan that can generally be reduced by about 15%. He also said that at the end of an economic downturn, the people are greatly hit, and in the future, they must seek to provide the people with appropriate guarantees to avoid further...</p>
<h3>Reform the Banking System</h3>
<p>There was a fear of shocking the people. The United States was not prepared for the arrival of this economic downturn, and its banking system was not sufficient to cope with the crisis, resulting in successive bankruptcies and shocking the public, which was a major cause of deep pain. The number of bank failures in the United States in the past year accounted for 10.5% of the total. In contrast, no bank failed in the United Kingdom, which shows that the U.S. banking system is flawed and needs to be greatly reformed by Congress. He also said that the previous Congress authorized the president to reorganize various administrative agencies, and a plan for the merger and consolidation has now been drafted, which will be announced by administrative order in a few days. It is estimated that more than 50 places will be merged and consolidated. If Congress does not express its disapproval within 60 days, it will be enacted as law.</p>
<p>In this presidential report, there was no special plan for economic relief. Some congressional leaders expressed disappointment, but the president believed that the economy is currently on a path to recovery, and the government's main task is to pay attention to it at all times and not allow it to be hindered.</p>
<h3>Hunger-Stricken People Petition in an Orderly Manner</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 6th - Three thousand hunger marchers, led by a band playing revolutionary music, marched through the streets today to present petitions to the speakers of the Senate and House of Representatives, demanding immediate allocation of cash for relief and the implementation of unemployment insurance. Police, firefighters, and plainclothes guards with handguns were on strict guard along the way, but no disturbances occurred. It is heard that many of the hunger marchers are genuine veterans holding pension vouchers to exchange for cash, while others were incited by the Communist Party to come.</p>
<p>The National News Agency, Washington, 6th - The hunger marchers stated today that they are just a group of unemployed people whose purpose is to correct economic suffering and have no intention of disturbing the order of the capital. After completing the petition, they left the capital tonight, maintaining order throughout and fulfilling the promises they made to the police authorities beforehand.</p>
<h3>As the Anglo-French Paris Conference Approaches, War Debts Will Be Paid Soon; France Fears Political Upheaval as a Result</h3>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 7th - British Prime Minister MacDonald and French Prime Minister Herriot both arrived here from Geneva this morning. As for whether Britain and France will pay the war debts due on December 15th, MacDonald and Herriot do not seem to have made a final decision. British Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain is also expected to arrive here tonight. After the three politicians consult tomorrow, they will definitely have a resolution on this matter. According to reliable sources, if Britain decides to pay as expected, then France will take the same attitude. If so, the French parliament is feared to overthrow the government because of opposition to paying the money, and then the prime minister will likely still be Herriot. The two prime ministers did not meet today; tomorrow will be a very important day.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 7th - The hope that the U.S. might not insist on the payment of the December installment of debts is now gradually dispelled by President Hoover's message to Congress. British and French political figures are therefore meeting in Paris tonight to discuss the current situation in the context of the "Gentleman's Agreement" reached in Lausanne. From a legal point of view, the payment of the December installment of debts cannot be regarded as a failure to reach a satisfactory settlement with the U.S. Payment is a necessary event before adjudication, so the Lausanne Agreement issue does not arise at present. Although Britain can decide to pay in full, France, even if it can pay, will suspend remittance temporarily. The French prime minister may get a small majority in parliament on this policy. It is heard that disarmament will also be discussed in Paris. It is expected that the discussion will be completed by Thursday, at which time the British Prime Minister will return to Geneva, and the French Prime Minister will also go to Geneva a little later.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 6th - The Czech government is now warning the U.S. that if the deadline for suspending war debt payments cannot be extended, there will be adverse consequences, and U.S. trade with the Czech Republic will be affected. If the Czech Republic pays the war debts due on December 15th, it will endanger the structure of its existing economy and finances. The Czech Republic's second reply has now been sent to Secretary of State Stimson.</p>
<p>Havas, Brussels, 6th - Belgium's reply to the U.S. was telegraphed out yesterday, explaining the important issues of Belgium's position in the war debt issue, the circumstances of the war debt loan, the situation created by the Hoover moratorium plan, and Germany's failure to pay reparations.</p>
<h3>Germany Rejects U.S. Disarmament Plan</h3>
<p>Will Not Return to Disarmament Conference Until Equality of Armaments is Recognized</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 6th - Germany is still rejecting all sweet talk, and will not return to the Disarmament Conference until all countries recognize its demand for equality of armaments. The five major powers, Britain, France, Italy, the U.S., and Germany, discussed this issue today. German Foreign Minister Neurath declared that Germany cannot accept the U.S. representative Davis's plan regarding the postponement of resolving Germany's demand for equality of armaments. However, a suggestion from someone in Davis's group could open the door to continued discussions.</p>
<h3>U.S.-Spanish Negotiations Ease</h3>
<p>The National News Agency, Washington, 6th - The Spanish ambassador has been ordered by his government to inform the U.S. State Department that the bill in Congress has been withdrawn. The Spanish government can now freely negotiate with the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation for its acquisition of the company's assets.</p>

According to Senator Borah today, he has received numerous letters and telegrams from business and industrial circles in various places, strongly urging the restoration of diplomatic and commercial relations with Soviet Russia. He believes that the new Senate will be able to pass a treaty with Russia after it is established on March 4th. At the same time, according to reliable sources, President-elect Roosevelt intends to consider the Russian issue immediately after taking office and decide on the U.S. position. Some of his friends have also said that Roosevelt believes that the U.S. will not be harmed by restoring diplomatic relations with Soviet Russia, but can gain the opportunity to directly negotiate with Soviet Russia.</p>
<p>The National News Agency, Washington, 6th - President-elect Roosevelt has left Warm Springs today and is returning to Albany. He will wait until his term expires on November 31st and hand over the governorship of New York before going to Warm Springs to complete his inauguration plan.</p>
<h3>German Parliament Opens</h3>
<p>Motion to Impeach Government Not Introduced</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 6th - The German parliament opened today. National Socialist Party members wore party uniforms and attended en masse. Captain Göring was elected speaker with 279 votes out of 545 votes. Göring delivered an opening speech, saying that the National Socialist Party leader Hitler should have political power, as this is the only way to resolve the political crisis.

<h3>Peculiar Reason for the Capsizing of the Japanese Cruiser "Sawarabi"</h3>
<p>Japanese Mine Torpedoes a Japanese Merchant Ship</p>
<p>Tokyo Dispatch from Dentsu Agency, 7th. Regarding the disaster of the "Sawarabi", the Ministry of the Navy released the following statement yesterday: The cause of the "Sawarabi" disaster has been reported previously. However, it is unheard of for a destroyer to capsize merely due to waves, and only the "Sawarabi" suffered disaster while the other two ships were safe and sound. This indicates that there must be other significant reasons. A decision has been made to collect data from all aspects and thoroughly investigate the cause to prevent a recurrence of such events. An investigative committee consisting of authorities in this field will be convened soon.</p>
<p>Dispatch from Kure Naval Port from Dentsu Agency, 7th. According to a public announcement from the Mako Naval Port Department, the "Sawarabi" was swept away by wind and waves and encountered disaster at a depth of 45 fathoms at 22 degrees 3 minutes north latitude and 120 degrees 2 minutes east longitude. Furthermore, the "Kitakami" arrived yesterday at 5 PM, and the "Isuzu" arrived last night at 10 PM. The "Tatsuta", "Notoro", and various destroyers are expected to arrive today. Of the 104 missing persons, it is almost impossible to rescue them.</p>
<p>Tokyo Dispatch from China United Press, 7th. At 11 AM this morning, the Japanese merchant ship "Shu" (transliteration) Maru was torpedoed and sunk by a Japanese Navy torpedo. The crew, six people under the age of ?, and six other passengers, including three women, were all floating on the sea. The navy rushed to rescue them. The cause, location, and losses are unclear.</p>
<p>Chiang Kai-shek Regularly Returns to Nanjing</p>
<h3>Proposals for the Third Plenary Session Have Been Sorted Out, and the Report on Bandit Suppression is Also Completed</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Chairman Chiang has been in Hankou supervising the suppression of remaining bandits from summer to winter, for seven months. Now, with the Third Plenary Session about to convene, he has decided to go to Nanjing to attend. All proposals have been sorted out, and the report on bandit suppression was completed on the 6th. The content mainly includes the progress of bandit suppression, political reforms, road construction, and local rehabilitation, all comprehensively collected, compiled by responsible drafters, and submitted to Secretary-General Yang Yongtai for review and printing in preparation for Chiang to take to Nanjing to report to the meeting. According to Chiang's report at the expanded memorial week at the headquarters on the 5th, the date of departure will be soon. However, according to a certain source, Chiang has decided to depart on the 8th and is expected to arrive in Nanjing on the 10th. The trip to Jiangxi cannot be realized temporarily due to the urgency of time. Recently, Chiang has been making extraordinary efforts in political reforms. As expressed at the memorial week on the 5th, he has devoted himself to military affairs for the first three months since July and to politics for the following four months, which is no exaggeration. He regards rural relief and education reform as particularly urgent. Regarding the rural relief issue, a relief office has been established, and one million yuan has been allocated for revolving finance. Various regulations have been promulgated to complete the Baojia organization within the specified time limit and to quickly establish rural cooperative preparatory societies to receive loans and lend to poor farmers, in order to implement this policy. The office has been working tirelessly under Chiang's orders, sending important officials such as Liu Ruxiang and Ling Jingshan to conduct on-site inspections in rural areas of various counties, and instructing the county magistrates to pay attention to seven matters: (1) Strictly follow the progress schedule issued by the headquarters for completing the Baojia organization, with the final deadline for the third phase set for January 5, 1933, to complete all tasks and submit a detailed report on the general situation of the countryside within ten days. (2) Rural residents who are truly unable to resume their businesses must meet the conditions stipulated in the articles of association of the rural cooperative preparatory societies in the bandit suppression areas in order to join the society. Attention must be paid to prevent them from being members of more than two societies at the same time, leading to opportunism. (3) The Agricultural Rehabilitation Committee should be established immediately. (4) Before the establishment of the cooperative preparatory societies, it is feared that farmers' knowledge is immature and the organization cannot be sound. Widespread publicity should be carried out to make it known to every household. The guidance, registration, loan application, and lending should be supervised, and the roster of members should be submitted. (5) The needed cattle, seeds, agricultural tools, and other necessities for rural areas may be requested from ? for planning before the preparatory societies are established. (6) Members of the preparatory societies should bear joint and several liability according to the regulations. Those who do not have the ability to live independently should not be allowed to ? arbitrarily, causing abuses. (7) Local tyrants and evil gentry are the pests of the countryside. In the emergency relief of the bandit areas, it is necessary to strictly prevent such ? from mixing in. Regarding the urgent relief of rural areas in the bandit areas, several consultations have been held with Xu Shiying, who returned to Shanghai on the evening of the 6th to raise relief funds. Regarding the issue of education reform, in addition to curbing the education unrest and ordering all suspended schools to resume classes, it was also decided to hold a speech at the Chonghua Cinema (designated as the Pacification Commissioner's Office) at 10 AM on the 7th, gathering principals, teachers, and five representatives from each class of middle schools in Hankou, as well as all members of the General Chamber of Commerce. In the afternoon, they crossed the river to gather middle school students and above in Wuchang for a speech. It was also decided to inspect the boy scouts of various schools in Wuhan at Zhongshan Park on the morning of the 8th, and to send Zhong Han, director of the Political Training Department of the headquarters, to handle military education in various schools in Henan, Hubei, and Anhui provinces for rectification.

<p>Jinan Demon Bandit Case</p>
<h3>The Arrested Criminals Are Currently Detained in the Detention Center, and Their Confessions Are Evasive, Only Admitting Belief in the Big Dipper Religion</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Special Task Force of the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau cracked the demon bandit Li Lechuan case at No. 124 Houyingfang a few days ago, attracting much attention from all walks of life. Yesterday afternoon, I went to the Public Security Bureau to visit Director Wang Kairu. Wang said that the case was reported, but because the truth was unknown, it was not appropriate to make an arrest rashly. After multiple investigations, it was confirmed that there were indeed irregular activities, so at 7 AM yesterday morning, the captain of the Special Task Force, Liu Yaoting, personally led the team police to crack the case. The criminals Song Wangshi, Li Lechuan, Fu Baoqi, etc., along with the copied full set of ceremonial regalia, shrines, yellow silk sacred cows, brocade crowns, flags, etc., were escorted to the bureau. The criminals are currently being held in the detention center, awaiting Chairman Han's personal interrogation. If they are said to be ignorant commoners, there are still ? registration patterns and other items in the copied items, and they are all ? of official families and should not be completely ignorant. It is thought that they initially used charms and oracles to lure the common people, and later, as they deceived more and more people, they intended to act irregularly and attempted to rebel. I went to the detention center again and saw Li Lechuan. According to Li, he and Song Wangshi are cousins and do not have a marital relationship. The ceremonial regalia and sacred cows were made for decorating the ancestral shrine, and he had no irregular thoughts and did not ? use charms and evil arts to become emperor. He knew nothing about it. Li was wearing a long robe, gray overcoat, and leather hat, with a square jaw and wide forehead, and looked about three inches ?, quite like the upper class. I went to another room to meet Fu Baoqi. Fu was also wearing a gray robe, slightly fatter than Li, but not as handsome as Li. According to him, he and Song Wangshi are also cousins, and his occupation is tailoring. Song Wangshi asked him to make yellow silk cow clothes, etc., and only knew that they were for Song Wangshi's family temple, and knew nothing else. What the carpenter Zhi Huaqing said was similar to Fu's statement.</p>
<p>(From right to left) (1) Song Wangshi (2) Li Lechuan (3) Fu Ziqi (4) Carpenter Zhi Huaqing</p>
<p>I went to the women's detention center to meet Song Wangshi. She was an old woman in her fifties or sixties, looking very healthy, wearing old-fashioned cotton trousers and a jacket, no different from ordinary people. However, her triangular phoenix eyes gave people a strange feeling at first glance. It can be known that when she was in her prime, she must have been enchantingly beautiful. According to her, her ancestors were ? high officials, so the family business was quite prosperous. Family members repeatedly wanted to frame her because they coveted her property, so she fled her home to Jinan and knew nothing about being a goddess. The copied sacred cow and shrine were made for the family shrine. Because the old shrine in the family was damaged, family members insisted that she rebuild it, so she made this shrine to prepare to take it home. As for the wooden cow that was made, since a real cow was used for every sacrifice in the family shrine, which cost a lot every year, she made this fake cow in order to achieve a permanent solution. All the brocade clothes, boots, and hats were toys used for playing roles during the Lantern Festival in the family. I gathered Li Lechuan, Song Wangshi, Fu Baoqi, and the carpenter Zhi Huaqing to take a photo together (see above). I went back to the Special Task Force and viewed the seized items. First, I saw the shrine, which was three stories high and about one zhang high and four chi wide. The bottom layer was an old ? drawer half square table, and the top two layers were building style, with several active small doors in the front and carved window edges, which were extremely detailed. The other three sides were hollow wooden boards with nothing inside, and there were ladders up and down for access. In front of the door were coiling dragon pillars, with dragon mouths spitting whiskers. Each door was engraved with a Wang character. Then there was the sacred cow, which was as big as a real cow, with its entire body made of shimmering apricot silk. The spine, eyebrows, tail, etc., were all black satin with a hairy edge, which was gorgeous and magnificent, and the value was not small. The outline inside the silk was the entire wood, so the production was very heavy. The four feet were standing on a flat plate, and four iron wheels were placed underneath, which could be pushed. There was also a yellow silk cow shape that had been made, but it was still missing its shape. There was also a full set of ceremonial regalia, such as door knives, elephant trunk knives, longevity sword knives, dragon head knives, sun, moon, stars, ?, fingers, hands, palms, fists, gold claws, axes, Chaotian oranges, etc., dozens of pieces, all newly carved from wood and not yet painted. There were also three clothes chests and one willow basket, mostly filled with old-fashioned colored brocade women's clothing, as well as a pair of blue satin court boots and a Qing-style cap. The most peculiar thing was that there were old-fashioned buttons of various colors, inserted with needles, into a large flower shape, with a small mirror inlaid in the center, the purpose of which was unknown. I collected all of the above items for a photograph. In addition, there were two volumes of old-style bound giant books, with vague ? words, but mostly containing words such as earth emperor, king world, world, dragon and phoenix. There were also ? many pieces, which were the same. In addition, there was a yellow satin put a ?, full of regular script characters, the wording was also incomprehensible, and there were ? many erroneous characters. According to an official from the Judicial Section of the Public Security Bureau, after the criminals were taken to the bureau, they had been interrogated several times. Although they did not admit to being emperors, their confessions were different. That is, the confessions of the people were also inconsistent first. However, the evidence was conclusive and would not allow them to quibble. They are now actively investigating and collecting evidence and are waiting for the Chairman's interrogation. Yesterday, when Song Wangshi was interrogated, she admitted that they belonged to the Big Dipper Religion and that she was the president, worshiping a Song Taoist from a temple in Mount Tai as their former teacher, and that there were many believers, but they only believed in religion and practiced medicine, and did not do anything about being an emperor. When asked what the yellow cow was for, she replied that it was used for the family shrine, which was a lie, and it was also something in the religion. When asked about the meaning of the yellow cow, she did not answer. After a long time, she finally replied, "There was a Zhao He who rode a green cow in the beginning." When asked why she used yellow instead of green, she stopped speaking. Today, she overturned her previous confession and still said that the yellow cow was used in the family shrine and had nothing to do with the Big Dipper Religion. Her confession was so vague, there must be something hidden. In addition to Li Lechuan (the false Great Emperor), Fu Ziqi (the false Earth Emperor), and Song Wangshi (the false Goddess) being arrested, it is said that there is also a so-called Human Emperor Wang ?, and the false Heavenly Emperor's East and West [Palace Liu sisters are now in Linyi, Southern Shandong, and have not yet been captured. It can be seen that their thoughts and actions are mostly governed by old novels and imitate the Yellow Turban thieves, ? regulations of Zhang Jiao and Zhang Bao, which is ridiculous and pitiful. At the time of the arrest, Li Lechuan made many ? words, the general meaning of which was that the words of the eighteen sons as emperors recorded in the Tui Bei Tu,</p>
<p>Shrines, Sacred Cows, and the So-called凿驾</p>
<p>I am surnamed Li, which has been applied to celestial phenomena, and I raised an army in the south. The south belongs to fire, and the north should be supplemented. The north belongs to water, and water and fire are both completed, so things can be completed. Xuan Tong ? has repeatedly sent people to negotiate, saying that Japan can supply me with guns and cannons to help me succeed, and also saying that I have practiced many spells, so guns and cannons may not be needed, etc. It is heard that Li's conspiracy has been brewing for many years, and a certain person is also a prime minister, and a certain person is also a general, and many have been appointed. What is even more strange is that the copied documents include donation registers and diary-like items. There are many women in the donation registers who have asked for seals and donated money, no less than tens of thousands, and the most donors are the Liu Tais, who have donated 500 yuan, which is suspected to be the family of their false East and West Palace. When asked about this, Li replied that it was only for doing good deeds and almsgiving. It is heard that women who donate a large amount of money can be matched in marriage by the false Heavenly Emperor, and a certain person is the prime minister's wife, and a certain person is the general's wife, which is truly ? unrealistic. Also, in his diary, there are certain people who came to discuss the construction of palaces on certain dates. Li's and others' confessions have repeatedly changed, and many of them are inconsistent before and after. While in the detention center, I asked Li and others about the matter of the false organization in Manchuria sending people to negotiate ?. They replied that they did not know that there were three northeastern provinces or the "Manchukuo", which also showed the cunning of their words. (December 6)</p>
<p>More Centenarians in the Border Area of Yunnan Province</p>
<h3>Malipo Has a Population of Only Tens of Thousands, Yet the Number of Centenarians Reaches Seven</h3>
<p>Kunming Correspondence: Malipo is a border area of Yunnan Province, bordering Vietnam, and has a patrol commissioner. The local people are mostly Yi and 少?. The Yi people live a very hard life, but they are extremely healthy. The total population of the area is only tens of thousands, yet the number of centenarians reaches seven, which is also a strange story. The following is a list of centenarians compiled by the household census taker in the area (surveyed in the autumn of 1932) for the reader's perusal:</p>
<p>Surname and Name Sex Current Age Occupation Ethnicity</p>
<p>He Hushi Female 102 Farmer Han</p>
<p>Tao Yangshi Female 106 Farmer Miao</p>
<p>Lu Chenshi Female 100 Farmer Zhuang</p>
<p>Wang Taoshi Female 100 Farmer Miao</p>
<p>Wang Si Male 120 Farmer Miao</p>
<p>Lu Weishi Female 100 Farmer Zhuang</p>
<p>Li Da Male 100 Farmer Yao</p>
<p>(Note): All of the above centenarians still have sharp senses and are able to work in the mountains. They have never suffered from any major illness. Only their hair has fallen out. Among them, Wang Si has changed his teeth twice and is sixty years old, yet he can still chew chicken bones, which is truly rare in the world.</p>
<p>Resolution of the Bengbu Salt Dispute</p>
<h3>After Mediation by Officials and Gentry, Both Salt Merchants and Salt Firms Made Concessions, and the North Salt Public Business Office and Salt Firms Resumed Business as Usual</h3>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: Previously, the local salt industry had a dispute with salt merchants over the objection to the North Salt Public Business Office, and the two sides were at odds for more than a month. Salt merchants were constrained by the salt firms and could not trade, and salt ? could not sell salt due to the lack of intermediaries, causing significant losses to both sides, and both were financially exhausted, making it difficult to continue. Xu Tingyao, commander of the Fourth Division stationed in Bengbu and commander of the garrison, believed that the salt industry was related to the people's livelihood, and if the delay was not resolved for a long time, it would have a great impact on the market. He specially invited local gentry Gao Weixuan, Peng Zhuoru,</p>
<p>Li Peisheng, and others to come forward to mediate and persuade both parties to make concessions to each other. After one mediation, both salt firms and salt merchants expressed their acceptance. On the 4th, he invited the backbones of the salt firms and salt merchants to meet and earnestly discuss and decide on the following compromise measures: (1)</p>
<p>The North Salt Public Business Office and all salt firms will resume business as usual. (2) All merchants who purchase salt must have the salt firms appraise the price and see the salt samples at the Salt Industry Association before paying the money to sell salt through the North Salt Public Business Office. (3) Each stone of salt will be charged a commission of 1 dime and 2 cents by the salt firms, plus 2 dimes and 4 cents for public security levy, school levy, and public association levy, for a total of 1 dime and 4 cents and 4 cents. The salt firms will receive 5 cents and 4 cents less than before. (4) The salt firms must stamp the salt when it is unloaded. (5) The money owed by the salt firms to the salt merchants will be repaid by Gao Weixuan and others within seven days, and the debtors will be responsible for the repayment. After the above measures were approved by both parties, they resumed business as usual on the 5th. Xiang Yuncheng, chairman of the Salt Industry Association, specially convened representatives of the salt ? at the association in the afternoon to report on the mediation process. All salt firm owners and partners expressed their satisfaction because the salt firms still operated as usual, and their livelihoods would not be panicked. The salt industry dispute that had lasted for more than a month was completely resolved (November 6th).</p>
<h3>Closing Arguments in the Hu Lifu Case (Continued)</h3>
<p>Prosecutor ? Wen ? stood up to state his arguments, saying that in this case, Hu Lifu organized a local maintenance association in the area occupied by the Japanese army. There were many Japanese ronin in the association. According to Hu's own confession, there were hundreds of members, and he was the ? president, in addition to maintaining order, he also collected import and export duties. The association was established on April 1 this year, and it claimed to have donated four or five thousand yuan by April 10 due to the intervention of the League of Nations, but the actual amount was more than that. Later, after the elimination, it was renamed Yunhe Company. From then on, Hu and the Japanese ronin recklessly used the name of business, but in fact opened opium dens, sold opium, and gambled to seek profit without doing anything evil. This prosecutor handled another case earlier and was also ? involved. It can be seen that Hu Lifu participated in it from beginning to end. When this prosecutor asked him, he said that the Japanese wanted to do it, and he had no way. This prosecutor asked him why he didn't leave, and he said that the Japanese were watching him and couldn't leave. Today, he said that he had left four days after the reorganization of Yunhe Company, which is insufficient for evidence. Later, when the Japanese army ? exited Zhabei, Hu was arrested, and many Japanese business cards were found near Hu. What Hu Lifu did was not only stated in detail by the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, but also in the two court investigations by this prosecutor, Hu also acknowledged the contents and nature of the maintenance association in great detail. Today, he said that the newspaper was lying, and the confession of the Public Security Bureau was based on the plot published in the newspaper, which is a far-fetched argument. May I ask, no matter what you do in the occupied territory of the Japanese army, you are doing it for the Japanese. He said that it was purely local, and no one can deeply believe it. The maintenance association was obviously organized under the order of the Japanese army. He said that he had registered with the Municipal Public Security Bureau when he organized the association. This prosecutor believes that there is no need to investigate this point because the matter ? is handled on behalf of the enemy, and even if it is registered, it is a crime. What's more, it has now been found out that it has not been registered. He issued a pass, and he signed it. As long as the goods passed through the occupied area of the Japanese army, they could pass when they saw the pass signed by him. If he did not collude with the Japanese army, why would the Japanese army release the goods when they saw the pass signed by him? Maintaining the local area may not be directly related to military affairs, but maintaining the local area and stabilizing order in the occupied area of the Japanese army allows the Japanese army to be stationed there and be safe and sound. This ? is also beneficial to the military, so he should be punished in accordance with the Emergency Law on Punishing Those Who Endanger the Republic of China. As for the part of the pistol, it is now ? found that the section of the indictment on privately hiding a pistol should be abandoned.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the lawyer Wang Jian's defense was read by the court clerk, and the court official announced that the debate in this case was over and the verdict was scheduled to be announced on the 12th, and then the court adjourned.</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>(Tang Qiusheng's Appeal Ruled Not Guilty) Tang Zikui, the owner of the Tang Helong Oil, Hemp, Bran, and Cake Company in Cangqiao, was assassinated last year. It was tragic and unbearable. The authorities ? arrested the murderer and arrested a thief involved in the case, claiming that Tang Daguan had bought someone to commit the crime. Therefore, his son Tang Qiusheng was considered a major suspect and was summoned for interrogation. ? A lawsuit was filed in the Criminal Court of the County Court. Tang Qiusheng hired Zhang Bao ? attorney to defend him. The County Court had previously sentenced him to seven years in prison. Tang Qiusheng refused to accept the judgment and ? hired Zhang Bao ? attorney to file an appeal with the Suzhou High Court. The court opened twice and summoned witnesses to Suzhou for questioning. It is now heard that Attorney Zhang has obtained the Suzhou Tang Qiusheng appeal case and has ? the court officials ruled to revoke the original decision of the County Court and declare him not guilty.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>(Liyang Murder Case Declared Not Guilty) In the case of the unclear death of Zhou Xushi's daughter-in-law, Zhou Xushi, the county government believed that Zhou Xushi was strangled to death by Zhou Xushi, so it sentenced Zhou Xushi to death. Zhou Xushi refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the High Court, which changed the sentence to life imprisonment. Zhou Xushi still refused to accept the sentence and filed a third instance appeal, which was sent back for retrial and changed to a sentence of ten years' imprisonment. Zhou Xushi still refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the Supreme Court, which still sent it back to the High Court for retrial and examined the body of Zhou Xushi's bone to determine that she had hanged herself. It was yesterday (6th) that Zhou Xushi was declared not guilty.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>(Police and Bandits Fight Fiercely at Huinong Bridge) ? Last night, at a time when the night was dim, a ? shocking story of bandits attempting to seize the guns of the police on duty occurred near Huinong Bridge in this county. On the west side of the bridge, there was a police officer named Wang Jin ? on duty at the ninth post of the sixth branch of the Public Security Bureau. Not long after being on duty, ? In front of the grocery store, there were suddenly four people wearing green short clothes resembling workers, each holding a pistol and attacking the police officer. They immediately opened eight shots to seize the guns. The police officer was shocked when he saw this and immediately ? ran across the bridge, while pulling out his gun to fight back. At that time, the police officer Zhou Banchen of the eighth post on the east side of the bridge also heard the alarm and came to the rescue with his gun to fight back. Just as they were in a stalemate, a patrol of the military police regiment passed by and immediately pulled out their guns to assist. The four bandits knew that they could not ? ? ? ? Escape with stones ? The military police patrol team immediately joined the police officers of the two posts and chased after them. The police headquarters also ? sent police ? to help encircle ? Ultimately, due to the darkness of the night, ? ? The incident was not captured. Afterwards, Duan Qishan, the director of the sixth branch, notified the Shidang ? Shang ? ? The 24th Detachment was fully armed to defend, and he personally led police officers to visit door to door to investigate the scene. A suspicious ? boat was found in the river there. When questioned, the boatman's words were vague, and the boat owner, Zhou Changhu, was ? ? Taken to the bureau for temporary detention. At the same time, Zhang Yuren, a member of the 5th Military Police Regiment, also ? led a team to encircle and arrest. Guo ? Shen and Shandong person ? Chunru ? names were found near the railway, and three packages of red pill raw materials were found, which were also taken to the regiment for questioning.</p>
<p>(Captured Impersonating Military Police Commander) ? A military policeman of the 5th Military Police Regiment stationed at the station saw a person yesterday afternoon wearing full military uniform and wearing the symbol of the second battalion commander of the ? Military Police Regiment, whose appearance was suspicious. He was immediately taken to the regiment for questioning. The name was Bu Yuankui, a Fujianese, 28 years old, impersonating the battalion commander was a fact. That night, he was escorted to the ? Suzhou ? The 3rd Military Police Regiment headquarters for interrogation. Also, a patrol of the 5th Military Police Regiment ? Yesterday afternoon at 2:00, two people impersonating secret agents of the Nanjing Military Police Headquarters, Jiao Jianping (from Beiping) and Wu Jianqiu (from Jiangyin), were captured in the Guangming Cinema in the city and taken to the regiment for interrogation.</p>

<p>(Resolution of Slaughter Tax Surcharge Dispute) The Xiyi Slaughter Tax Collection Office had been in dispute with meat merchants over the tax issue for two months. Recently, the Chamber of Commerce invited both parties to resolve the issue fairly. However, a dispute arose over the educational construction surcharge. Yesterday, the Chamber of Commerce invited the heads of the Education and Construction Bureaus, the director of the Slaughter Tax Collection ?, and the director of the County Affairs to negotiate together, to investigate the past remittance situation in detail, and to refer to the current collection status. As a result, it was decided that the Slaughter Tax Collection ? would pay the education surcharge in full, 8,400 yuan per year, an average of 700 yuan per month. The special construction donation was 4,200 yuan per year, an average of 350 yuan per month.

Also, 30 bandits came to the Di ? area of the district the night before and robbed all the broadswords of the Knife Society and wounded one member.</p>
<p>(Order to Continue Collecting House Rent) ? The county government previously received an order to collect house rent for military funds. After the county magistrate Li set up a bureau to collect the rent, due to the disaster in this county, the market was financially exhausted, and very few households paid. Although ? the county government sent police to force the collection, it was ineffective. ? After only collecting for one month, they ended the collection and reported to the Finance Department.

The county government has now announced it to the public and ordered ? Public Security Sub-agencies to continue collecting the rent.</p>
<h3>Rugaogao</h3>
<p>(Crackdown on Bandit Den Leads to Arrest of Two Bandits) Yang Huichuan, captain of the Second Squadron of the Rugaogao County Police, led a soldier to the Lu Port, to a certain Xing's house in Xiaoyan Village, to exchange financial bureau issued temporary stamps. While passing the township public office, he noticed that the house on the left was closed during the day, which aroused his suspicion. He went forward and knocked on the door. At that moment, five bandits rushed out of the back of the house, each with a gun, and fired at Yang. Yang also drew his gun and returned fire, and ordered the soldier to rush back to summon the team to encircle and suppress them. Seeing the unfavorable situation, the bandits fled through the back door. Yang continued to pursue. At that time, the Water Cave Mouth Security Corps had heard the news and arrived, capturing the key bandits Shi Guangying and Wang Changsen on the spot. Afterwards, Yang led the team to search the house, and found a seal of the "Chinese Red Jiangsu Guerrilla Four-County General Command", a seal of the "Chinese Communist Jiangbei Red Army Rugaogao County Committee", a seal of the "Chinese Communist Jiangsu Tongru Tai County Committee", two communist private seals, twenty-five Brolin pistol bullets, printed bags, and many other guns, bullets, Communist documents, booklets, and utensils. The matter has now been reported to the government for review.</p>
<h3>Taixian</h3>
<p>(Request to Restore the Sanli Culvert) The Sanli Culvert in the west of Hai'an Town, Taixian County, was destroyed by a major flood. The dispute over whether to open or close it has been unresolved for a long time. Now, it is reported that Chen Jiesan and others from the district have jointly submitted a petition to the county government, requesting the transfer to the provincial government and various departments concerned regarding the advantages and disadvantages of opening and closing the culvert and the importance of water conservancy. They request a solution based on existing cases and the restoration of the culvert.</p>
<h3>The Inside Story of the Taiyuan Student Movement</h3>
<p>Recently, several schools in Taiyuan City suddenly experienced an unusually intense student movement. Students of Shanxi University demanded living expenses from the president, Wang Lu. Wang was unable to meet the demands and therefore expressed his resignation. At the same time, students from normal schools and junior high schools throughout the city have been petitioning the Education Department and the provincial government for days, demanding the restoration of the government-funded system, because the authorities cancelled subsidies and collected tuition fees this year, making it difficult for them to study. In addition, students at the Provincial No. 1 Middle School discovered the expulsion of the principal, Cui Xuanyan, and the Provincial Normal School also experienced infighting over the expulsion of the principal, Huang Quan, with students divided into "supporting Huang" and "expelling Huang" factions. Several people in the expelling Huang faction were severely beaten. For several days (from November 23 to November 27), students from provincial and government-funded schools [Shanxi University, No. 1 Middle School, No. 1 Normal School, No. 1 Women's Normal School, etc.] gathered at the Education Department to voice their grievances, petition the provincial government, and stage demonstrations. Posters and declarations were plastered all over the city, and the streets were filled with them, creating a situation like a prairie fire. The causes of this student movement, on the surface, seem to be nothing more than the decline of Shanxi currency, the bankruptcy of the rural economy, the hardship of people's livelihoods, and problems with schooling. [Most students in Shanxi Province come from farming families. Eighty to ninety percent of the students at government-funded schools are from poor families. However, the education authorities did not consider the difficulties of the people, and instead of exempting or reducing the existing tuition fees of various schools, they converted government-funded schools such as No. 1 Normal School and No. 1 Women's Normal School into normal junior high schools, collecting additional tuition fees and increasing the burden on students, which led to the fierce student movement. However, there are also other deep-seated reasons and backgrounds, which are described as follows.]</p>
<p>(The Source of the Student Movement) Before 1921, Shanxi education ostensibly adhered to a strict policy. Since the expulsion of the principal at the Provincial No. 1 Middle School in 1922, the authorities have been unable to restrain the laissez-faire tendencies, and it has continued ever since. During the years of party transitions in 1925 and 1926, politicians often used student unity and blind action as tools for seizing power. Since then, student movements have surged, and incidents such as expelling principals, strikes, petitions, demonstrations, and vandalizing the residences of important figures have become commonplace. Principals can only adopt a lenient policy in school affairs and can only adopt a laissez-faire attitude toward students. However, even this does not prevent them from being expelled by students due to other relationships. Although this student movement is still mixed with other reasons, it is mostly a historical development, and its outbreak is not accidental.</p>
<p>(Factions at Shanxi University) Professors at Shanxi University have always been divided into two factions: one is the Western-returned student faction [such as Wang Youchen, president of Shanxi University], Wang Jianxian [dean of the engineering department], etc., and the other is the Eastern-returned student faction, such as Ji Gongquan [dean of the law department and current director of the Education Department], Zhang Guansan, etc. Although these two factions ostensibly claim to cooperate, in reality, they have long been at odds. Regarding the recent incident of students demanding living expenses from the principal, there is a suspicious point: (1) The most that students can demand from the school authorities within the possible range is exemption from tuition fees. How can living expenses be proposed? Even if a subsidy is requested, there are other procedures [requesting subsidies from their respective counties of origin, or directly submitting a petition to the Education Department and the provincial government]. Why make things difficult for the principal? (2) The principal should understand the students' difficulties and forward the students' requests to the Education Department and the provincial government for review. Why was he unable to cope and resign and return home? Based on the above two points, we are convinced that most students were motivated to launch a student movement due to livelihood problems, but some of them are inevitably playing another role, using the masses to make things difficult for the Education Bureau.</p>
<p>(The Normal School Background of No. 1 Middle School) After Wei Riqing, the principal of No. 1 Middle School, was expelled in 1922, his successors often had strong backers. Therefore, when the political situation changed, the principal of No. 1 Middle School was often expelled or resigned voluntarily. Since Cui served as principal, it can be said that there were no other relationships. Cui was a graduate of the Higher Normal School (now the Normal University). He served as an English teacher at No. 1 Middle School and later as the dean of academic affairs for seventeen or eighteen years. Last year, when the Shanxi September 18th Incident [September 18th Incident, the provincial party headquarters shot students petitioning] occurred, the former principal, Liang Tai, fled [Liang Tai was a member of the party executive committee and was involved in the incident]. Cui then succeeded as principal of the school. Since taking office, he has actively reorganized school affairs and has not been lenient with the students. However, when it comes to hiring faculty and staff, he has used graduates from the Higher Normal School to supplement all but a few long-serving and senior people, inevitably leading to a situation where one faction is in control. Although the students' declaration to expel the principal this time accuses Cui of using private connections, it is only a pretext, but it seems that there are also grounds for this.</p>
<p>(No. 1 Normal School and Other Government-Funded Schools) Although the reasons for the expulsion of the principal of No. 1 Normal School are complicated, the cancellation of subsidies and the increase in tuition fees are indeed the main reasons. Normal schools have always been government-funded, and most of the students are from poor families, accounting for seventy to eighty percent. The decline of Shanxi currency and the bankruptcy of the rural economy, coupled with the unusually severe floods this year, have made life difficult in general, especially affecting students' schooling. However, in the autumn of this year, the Education Department suddenly ordered all normal schools to be renamed normal junior high schools, cancelling subsidies and collecting admission fees. New students had to pay a total of more than 45 yuan for all tuition fees, and they had to pay for their own books and board, which led to many poor students dropping out of school. Those who have already enrolled are also struggling to make ends meet. This is the main reason for the normal school student movement. (Taiyuan, November 28)</p>

<h3>All Sectors Concerned About the Safety of Su Bingwen and Others</h3>
<p>The Support Association and Others Cabled the National Government for Rescue Yesterday</p>
<p>General Su Bingwen led his troops to resist Japan. Recently, due to pressure from the enemy's superior weapons, he painfully led his troops to retreat into Russian territory. His safety is of great concern to people across the country. The Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army Support Association cabled the Central Government the night before last, requesting that measures be taken to rescue them. The Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang People's Committee cabled Su and others yesterday morning to inquire about their whereabouts after leaving the country, but as of 5 pm last night, there was still no reply. The Northeast Anti-Japanese Army Joint Communications Office and the Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe Volunteer Army Support Association and other agencies are studying rescue measures, but they feel that it is difficult due to the lack of restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Russia. Most people believe that relief should be carried out by private individuals. The details of the cables are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe Four Provinces Volunteer Army Support Association held a meeting last night and sent a cable to the National Government, which read: "To the Honorable Executive Yuan of the Nanjing National Government: The Northeast has been occupied for more than a year, and Rehe is in imminent danger. The people of various places are unwilling to be subjugated and have formed volunteer armies. However, the government has not provided any assistance in terms of guns, ammunition, or funds. The volunteer armies have been fighting hard for years. Recently, the Japanese invaders have used the forces of the whole country to besiege our isolated and helpless volunteer armies. General Su Bingwen's troops retreated into Russian territory due to running out of ammunition and supplies. The people of the whole country share a deep grief. The survival of the nation is at stake. We earnestly request that you make a quick plan to provide prompt assistance, especially to General Su's troops. We await your orders with grief and impatience. Respectfully, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe Volunteer Army Support Association, Yang."</p>
<p>The National Joint Association of Patriotic Organizations from All Walks of Life cabled the Soviet government in Moscow yesterday, saying: (The previous part omitted) "General Su Bingwen, commander-in-chief of our country's patriotic army, who is fighting for the survival of the nation and for the righteousness of mankind, led more than 4,000 soldiers and patriotic people to retreat into your country's territory due to the violent oppression of Japanese imperialism. Your country is a revolutionary country and its purpose is to help weak nations. Please provide prompt rescue and assistance, and please find a way to escort them to Shanghai from Vladivostok, so that they can serve in the future. Then, our 400 million people will be extremely grateful. Respectfully, the National Joint Association of Patriotic Organizations from All Walks of Life, Yin, Yu."</p>
<p>The United Association of Patriotic Organizations sent an urgent cable to Su Bingwen and others yesterday, which read: "To General Su Bingwen and all officers and soldiers, and displaced people: The Japanese invaders are brutal, cutting off land and slaughtering people. Fortunately, the volunteer armies have sworn to fight to the death. Their prestige has spread far and wide, shocking the world. Recently, due to months of hard fighting and running out of ammunition and supplies, it has become difficult to resist. They fought bloody battles and retreated painfully. Their loyalty will be remembered forever. Their courageous spirit of eliminating the enemy and their sacrifice will be successful. All of our people admire them. The Chinese people in the current situation in China can only find victory and survival through continuous struggle and continued desperate efforts. At present, the only principle for saving the country is to resist whether we win or lose, and to fight desperately whether we live or die. We believe that the failure of you all this time is the inevitable result of the current resistance, and it is by no means an unexpected event, so there is no need to worry. We can only increase our efforts because of failure, and double our fire because the enemy is strong. We are determined to live and die, and never stop. Let us see how long the violence of the enemy can last. You have been reduced to foreign lands for the sake of the country and the nation. The surviving people cannot sleep or eat, and they are indignant and want to die. In addition to urgently finding ways to provide relief, we sincerely send this cable to express our condolences. We respectfully hope that you will take care of yourselves for the sake of the country and wait for the next time. Shanghai United Association of Patriotic Organizations, Standing Directors Shen Zuru, Chen Yafu, Zhang Tianbai, Chen Peide, Zhang Yichen, Wang Hanliang, etc., bowed."</p>
<p>The Northeast Volunteer Army Transportation Team issued a circular yesterday, which read: "To all public organizations and compatriots from all walks of life in the country: The Northeast has been occupied for more than a year. Fortunately, our anti-Japanese generals have been unyielding and brave in their resistance. Although the enemy is stubborn, their goals have not been achieved. Now, the bad news has come that we have learned that General Su Bingwen's troops, the isolated army resisting Japan in Heilongjiang, have been forced to retreat due to running out of ammunition and supplies, and they will be transferred to Russian territory to seek a way back to China. Upon hearing this, we were filled with grief. We hope that all compatriots in the country will refer to the cable from the troops and act on the principle that everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the country, quickly provide assistance so that the brave anti-Japanese warriors can continue their former ambitions. Our team is about to depart, and all team members are willing to go to the righteous cause and dedicate themselves to the country. They can help with the transportation projects of the volunteer army. As long as there is a breath left, we vow not to return alive. We hope that people from all walks of life will provide guidance from time to time, so that we can follow it. We are anxiously waiting."</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce cabled the government yesterday, requesting that it quickly find ways to rescue the generals and soldiers. The original cable read: "To the Honorable Executive Yuan, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Ministry of Transportation of the Nanjing National Government: Recently, we received a cable from Su Bingwen, Zhang Dianjiu, Xie Ke, Jin Kuibi, Wang Erzhan, Wu Delin, Sun Lin, Dong Shuhong, Gu Junling, Lang Guochen, Yin Shengzuan, and others from Hailar, which briefly stated (the original text is omitted). Based on this, we should cable your honorable Yuan, Ministry, and Department for review. We earnestly request that you quickly find ways to rescue them. Respectfully, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, Lin Kanghou, bowed."</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu's Speech on Great Shanghai</h3>
<p>Mainly Unplanned and Deformed Development</p>
<p>Future Reliance on Citizen Cooperation for Rapid Advancement</p>
<p>The evening before last, at 7 o'clock, Mayor Wu Tiecheng delivered a speech on the present and future of Great Shanghai at the Western YMCA on Jing'an Temple Road. It was translated by Municipal Secretary Zhang Dingrong. Details of his speech are recorded below: Today, I have this opportunity to talk about the current situation of our city in a short time. The topic is "The Present and Future of Great Shanghai." I hope you will provide guidance.</p>
<p>(The Present and Future of Great Shanghai) In our ideal, the future Great Shanghai, even if it cannot become a utopian city, is driven by the trend of the times. The great achievements of urban construction in various countries around the world will not only be the largest port in the East but also comparable to the most prosperous cities in the world. All industries, commerce, and international trade will reach unlimited development, and guests will come and enjoy themselves, forgetting to return. I know that the mayor at that time must be an outstanding talent to be competent, and judging from the complexity of his duties and the amount of social interaction, it is certain that he cannot be as leisurely as I am tonight. Although the above is an ideal, it is not difficult to realize. Looking at the current situation and history, the rapid progress of municipal administration in our city in the past is not inferior to that of any city in the world. However, this is not entirely the result of the efforts of the citizens of the city, but a deformed development without a plan. Therefore, if all future facilities can be implemented according to plan, and Chinese and foreign citizens cooperate sincerely, the speed of progress and the beauty of the results can be imagined. It is not surprising that the citizens and the government have not made much effort in the past. In Chinese history, there is no new urban organization, and people living in cities do not participate in administration. In other words, people are passive or negative about politics.</p>
<p>(Chinese Municipal Administration Started in Guangzhou) Chinese municipal administration started in Guangzhou. On February 15th of the tenth year of the Republic of China, the Guangdong Provincial Government announced the "Provisional Regulations of Guangzhou Municipality," designating the entire Guangzhou Municipality as a municipal administrative district, directly under the provincial government. Under the mayor, there were six bureaus: finance, public security, health, public works, and education, responsible for various matters of urban facilities. A municipal council was established to give citizens the opportunity to participate in municipal administration. Since then, all parts of the country have risen up and paid attention. Since its establishment, the city has made rapid progress, with wide roads, grand buildings, and other facilities, which are excellent. Those who have visited Guangzhou can all attest to this.</p>
<p>(Past Shortcomings and Current Facilities) Shanghai followed Guangzhou and was designated as a special municipality directly under the Executive Yuan by the National Government in July of the sixteenth year of the Republic of China. The foundation of our city was established. Before the sixteenth year, although Shanghai had the organization of the Commercial Port Supervisory Office, its scope was narrow and its time was temporary, with little development to speak of. Our city was established not long ago, and its age is young, like a toddler who can only walk and cannot run fast. Thanks to the efforts of successive mayors and the assistance of citizens, it has taken shape and is worthy of being a lively and clever child. The future development is limitless. If we want to know the future Great Shanghai, it seems that we must first briefly describe the past performance of this infant and the shortcomings in its environment, so as to examine and verify. According to the statistics, the total area of Shanghai is 494.69 square kilometers. If the two special districts are added, it totals 527.51 square kilometers. However, in such a vast area, things have never been unified. Taking the area under the jurisdiction of the municipal government as an example, before the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, there were separate districts of Nanshi, Zhabei, and the rural area, each doing its own thing. It was not until the establishment of the municipal government that unification was achieved, and administrative and construction efficiency began to improve. In this short period of five years, I would like to use statistics to briefly cite several auspicious signs as proof of the facts. The roads in Shanghai before the sixteenth year of the Republic of China were 153.95 kilometers long, with an area of 1,504,293 square meters. Now, they are 303.93 kilometers long, with an area of 3,179,486 square meters. In five years, the length has increased by 149.98 kilometers, and the area has increased by 1,675,193 square meters. The ditches have also increased by 31.29 kilometers in five years. In terms of electricity supply, the city had 12,911 kilowatts before the sixteenth year of the Republic of China. Now, it has 26,805 kilowatts, an increase of 13,894 kilowatts in five years. There were originally 3,758 street lights, and now there are 8,301, an increase of 4,543. In terms of water supply, the two companies in Nanshi and Zhabei supplied a total of 65,200 cubic meters in the sixteenth year of the Republic of China. Now, they supply a total of 93,385 cubic meters, an increase of 28,185 cubic meters in five years. As for the improvement of water quality, it is particularly significant. In the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, Zhabei tap water had 8,208 bacteria per cubic millimeter. Now, it has been reduced to 36. Nanshi tap water had 3,498 bacteria per cubic millimeter in the sixteenth year of the Republic of China. Now, it has been reduced to 50. In terms of transportation facilities, the most significant progress since the sixteenth year of the Republic of China is the municipal ferry. Five or six years ago, if we wanted to go from Puxi to Pudong, we had no other choice but to use small ferries or sampans. The inconvenience of ordinary travel had reached its extreme, and the danger was increasing daily. Furthermore, Pudong is an important area of the city, but its development has been difficult due to the lack of close connection with Puxi. We have always proposed building a bridge, but due to the huge cost, it is still a pie in the sky. In order to seek rescue from the above, the municipal government decided to establish a ferry service. The distance across the river is suitable, with a total of seven ships. The fares are low, the management is strict, and the sailing is punctual and fast, which is extremely convenient for passengers. Its achievements have exceeded our expectations. Last year alone, there were more than 4.4 million passengers. Now, we are actively preparing to expand the cross-river ferry to meet the needs. The advantages of the municipal ferry are not only a supplement to transportation but also two other important points: ① The population of Shanghai is large, and daily vegetables and other agricultural products rely entirely on the supply from the surrounding rural areas. The more sources of supply, the lower the prices, and the cost of living in the city will not rise. Therefore, the ability of the municipal ferry to easily transport agricultural products from Pudong to Puxi has a great impact on the lives of citizens. ② Every summer, citizens suffer from the lack of places to rest and enjoy the coolness. Since the opening of the ferry, thousands of Chinese and foreign citizens in Puxi have visited Donghan and Gaoqiao every day. In the future, after the Gaoqiao seaside beach is renovated and improved, that place will become the only summer resort, and its benefits to the citizens will certainly be immeasurable. In terms of hygiene and education, the importance of public health in Shanghai is self-evident. The municipal government pays close attention to the health of citizens and the prevention of epidemics. Currently, all meat in the city must be officially inspected by veterinarians before and after slaughter, which was initiated by our municipal government. The widespread implementation of various vaccinations was also first advocated by our municipal government. The serum used is self-made and supplied to the public concessions and the French concession. In the past two or three years, the effectiveness of epidemic prevention has become increasingly apparent. This year, due to the Japanese invasion of Shanghai, the epidemic was contained by making every effort to prevent it, and the city was able to remain safe, which is evident to everyone. Regarding education, since educational administration has always been inconsistent, the municipal government has been engaged in reorganizing and unifying the organization, enriching equipment, and improving the treatment of teachers since its establishment. There are currently 180 municipal primary schools and 5 middle schools, among which many primary and secondary school students have been newly established in the past five years. Previously, the city's education expenditure was only several hundred thousand yuan per year. In the past five years, it has increased to 1.2 million yuan, accounting for more than 10% of the city's revenue. It is hoped that it will increase to 25% in the future. Although the number of municipal schools and the amount of funding are far from sufficient to meet the needs of the entire city, they are several times higher than those of other cities and remote provinces in the country, which also shows the magnitude of the city's scope. The financial problem is the key to all facilities. Although the financial situation of our city is not sufficient now, it is not the phenomenon that should exist. The annual income and expenditure of our city are offset, not only without loss but also with surplus. This is all due to the financial reorganization in previous years. Five years ago, the income was only two or three million yuan, but it has recently increased to more than seven million yuan. If the January 28 Incident had not occurred, the city's income could have exceeded last year's budget by the end of June, reaching 10 million yuan, which can be proved by various facts. Unexpectedly, the sound of gunfire turned everything into a bubble, which is very frustrating. However, I believe that the original state will soon be restored, so that the future Great Shanghai can be realized as soon as possible. There are still many other municipal facilities and problems that will be explained in detail when the heads of various bureaus come to give speeches in the future, so I will not discuss them for the time being. However, the above points are enough to prove that we have hope for this child.</p>
<p>(Future Improvement Plan) However, in my opinion, the future Great Shanghai has many shortcomings in its current form, and we must seek ways to fundamentally improve it. Now, I would like to put forward one or two points for your discussion: ① Looking at the existing facilities in Shanghai as a whole, there was no overall design at the beginning. I think no one expected the city to reach today's prosperity. Therefore, the streets in various places lack planned regulations. Even if we want to improve it now, it is difficult. In the future, the impact on transportation will inevitably become more apparent. ② In terms of population and commerce, Shanghai has become the third largest city in the world. The number of ships coming to our city this year has reached hundreds of thousands of tons. However, regardless of the size of the ships, they must travel for more than an hour after entering the Huangpu River before they can berth. Sometimes, passengers cannot even land directly. This kind of economic loss and inconvenience is rare in countries around the world. How can we ignore it? The current situation is already like this. If we think about it, what will the congestion and inconvenience be like in 20, 30, or 100 years? Therefore, in this childhood period, for the sake of the adult Great Shanghai, we should use the farthest vision and the greatest determination to jointly build the future Great Shanghai and improve the current environment. The Shanghai Municipal Government, in view of this, decided on a unified plan for the future Great Shanghai a year ago, starting with the construction of the city center, and at the same time planning the commercial port and the Huangpu port entrance bridge. Experts from European and American city design companies were invited to contribute their opinions, and they all agreed. Now, we are actively carrying out the plan. In the future, the benefits of realizing this strategy for the citizens of Shanghai and international trade will certainly be immeasurable. Some say, "The environment in Shanghai is already very good, and the Shanghai child is also very healthy. Why not let it develop naturally, but use this kind of plan to restrain it?" I dare to answer, "If this child does not have disciplined and orderly training, the body and brain will inevitably develop abnormally, and even if the palm passes, people will be sufficient to swell the abdomen, or even suffer from hundreds of diseases that cannot be cured. As nannies, since we have seen this, how can we be willing to sacrifice the future fate of this child?" According to the current plan, the administrative area, commercial area, industrial area, and residential area of the future Great Shanghai will all be clearly defined. In terms of transportation, they will be interconnected, making travel convenient. Residents can be free from the disgust of heavy smoke and poisonous gas, and factories can be free from the restrictions of development. Ships can enter and berth at the docks immediately, and goods can be loaded directly onto trains and transported to various provinces for sale. In addition to the Pudong ferry, there will also be a bridge and railway connection. The benefits of these kinds of benefits are truly endless. However, this plan does not abandon the existing prosperous areas, and the roads in various places can be connected. Therefore, even if the population and commerce increase tenfold or dozens of times, there is no need to worry that they cannot be accommodated. Now, I will briefly describe the plan as follows: ① Water and land transportation. In terms of waterways, the Huangpu River is actually the main stream. The existing docks in the port are already very cramped in location and too far from the port, which takes time to navigate. In the future, with the development of commerce and the increasing number of ships, it will not be enough to build large-scale harbors to meet the needs. Therefore, the location of the future dock area will be in the Wusong area, and the location along the coast of Pudong can be used for the expansion of the commercial port. At present, inland transportation mostly takes the Wusong River. In the future, this river will also be unable to accommodate all ships coming to Shanghai. Therefore, the Wusong Bay and Zhaobang will in fact be the hub of inland transportation in the future, which is also expected. If a canal can be excavated at a suitable location to connect with the Wusong River, transshipment will be even more convenient. As for the land, the existing railway lines are far away from the waterways and docks, making it difficult to connect water and land. Therefore, after the city center is built, the location of the commercial port will be determined at the same time, and the railway lines in Shanghai must be rerouted. It is assumed that Zhenru will be the transportation terminal, and a branch line will be built from here, passing north through the Rucheng Hujiazhuang and east along the southern bank of the Luzaobang to the Wusong area, connecting with the South Port. Furthermore, an elevated railway will be built from Zhenru, passing through Pengpu and reaching Jiangwan, which will be the future Shanghai Central Station. Then, passengers and light goods can be directly transported into the city center area. The prosperity of the North Station can still be maintained, and the Shanghai-Hangzhou railway line will remain the same as before. However, starting from Shanghai Station, the railway line will be extended to Dongjiadu, and the ferry to Pudong will be built directly north to the bridge, so that transportation in Pudong can also be made more convenient. ② Road system. Regarding the roads in the city center area, I will briefly describe them as follows: A. Building main roads connecting the commercial port railway and various districts. These roads are generally very wide, either connecting to the future commercial port or connecting to the future central station, or connecting to the current concession and other urban areas, like starlight radiating in all directions, with the city center area in the center, controlling the overall situation. B. Building ordinary roads to facilitate commerce and residence. The purpose of these roads is to facilitate commerce and transportation in the city center area and its vicinity, and to build them separately to facilitate construction. The planned routes are about 170 kilometers long, and their layout is based on a chessboard style and a spider web style, surrounding the periphery, and determined according to the orthogonality or obliquity of the main roads, so as to ensure that the divided sections are suitable for construction. In addition, due to the climate in this city, it is suitable to face south, so the eastern direction of each section is lengthened to reduce the number of north-south roads. In addition, the sections parallel to the main roads are also lengthened as much as possible to reduce the intersection of ordinary roads and main roads. C. Establishing gardens and sports fields to benefit the health, rest, and recreation of citizens. For the sake of the health and spiritual cultivation of citizens, the existing rivers in the city center area and its vicinity are fully utilized, and plots of land are delineated to set up large gardens and open spaces, and efforts are made to make them suitable for mutual connection to embellish the city and facilitate sightseeing. Zoning plan: According to the current zoning plan for the entire city, the city center area and the area south to the old city of Nanshi are commercial areas, the north is the commercial port area, and the west is the residential area. The city center area, according to the general rules of urban organization, should be the location of administrative organs and important buildings. Now, the zoning plan for the city center area is briefly described as follows: Political District: All administrative organs and important public buildings should be located in the core and superior locations of the city to show solemnity and prosperity. The central part of the city center area is the intersection of two main roads, and there are gardens embellishing it, which is most suitable for being designated as a political area. The municipal government and its affiliated bureaus, the municipal party headquarters, the municipal council, the library, the museum, the art gallery, etc., should all be built here. Commercial District: In the northern part of the city center area, close to the commercial port and connected to the passenger terminal, the prosperity of commerce in the future can be predicted. Therefore, a large part of it is designated as a commercial area to meet the trend of development. In addition, the land along the main roads is heavily trafficked, and building shops here is both profitable and can limit the residential areas behind, so as to avoid noise. Therefore, it is also designated as a commercial area. Residential District: Except for the parts that have been designated as political districts and commercial districts in the city center area and its vicinity, the rest are designated as residential areas. The residential area is divided into A, B, and C. Type A residential area is for building residences for merchants and others, and it seeks quietness. Therefore, its location is near the gardens and open spaces. Moreover, since the supply and demand for this type of residence is relatively small, the area is small. Type B residential area is for building ordinary residences, and the supply and demand are relatively large, so the area is larger. The above plan for the city center area is now being carried out. The construction of the municipal government building started last year and could have been completed in July of this year, but it was obstructed by the January 28 Incident and must be completed in May of next year. At that time, the municipal government and its affiliated bureaus will be prepared to move in to show the realization of the future Great Shanghai. My discussion here is very interesting, and I deeply believe that you also have great hopes for the future Great Shanghai. However, in order to make this plan a reality as soon as possible and ensure that all construction is not hindered, the concerted action of all citizens is indispensable. All those who live in this city, regardless of their nationality, have the obligation to build Great Shanghai, and should regard Shanghai as their homeland. The citizens of Great Shanghai and the glory of Great Shanghai are the glory of all citizens. I am willing to join you in wishing success in the future.</p>
<h3>New Commander Minai Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Loudly Singing the Old Tune of Sino-Japanese Friendship</p>
<p>(Meeting Representatives) Yesterday morning at 8 o'clock, the new commander of the Japanese Navy's Third Fleet, Vice Admiral Minai, arrived in Shanghai on the flagship Izumo and berthed at River Tube No. 78 in the Huangpu River. Commander Sakano, Rear Admiral Sugimoto, Colonel Shima, Lieutenant Colonel Higuchi, and others arrived at the ship at 10:30 a.m. to welcome him. Minister Arima Yoshi also sent Military Attaché Kitaoka, along with Japanese Consul Ishishe, Administrative Committee Chairman Yasui, and representatives of the Japanese community, to visit the ship. A total of more than 40 government and civilian representatives boarded the ship one after another. At 1:00 p.m., they took photos on the ship and left. Minai said that he had been to Shanghai when the May 30th Incident occurred, and it has been several years since then. His adjutant Ishikawa and paymaster Okada also came with him.</p>
<p>(Reviewing the Fleet) After arriving in Shanghai, Minai immediately issued a notice to review the four newly dispatched ships of the 27th Fleet, including the Hishi and Ashi, in Shanghai starting at 2:00 p.m. today. Tomorrow morning, he will review the Shanghai Special Naval Landing Force. On the 12th, he will review the First Overseas Dispatch Fleet's flagship Atago. In the afternoon, he will review the destroyers of the 24th Fleet, including the Yanagi and Momo. After the 12th, he will go to Nanjing and other ports along the Yangtze River at a later date.</p>
<p>(Visiting the Mayor) At 10:00 a.m. today, Minai, accompanied by an interpreter, first visited the commanders of the British, American, French, and Italian ships in Shanghai. Then, he went to Gaochang Temple to pay a visit to the Chinese Navy authorities. At 2:00 p.m., he went to visit Minister Arima Yoshi and paid a visit to the commanders of the foreign forces stationed in Shanghai. After 3:00 p.m., he went to the Municipal Government to meet Mayor Wu. Our Mayor Wu has scheduled to return the visit at 11:00 a.m. on the 10th.</p>
<p>(Issuing a Declaration) Upon arriving in Shanghai, Minai issued a declaration to the Japanese residents in Shanghai, which roughly stated that on the first of this month, he was appointed as the commander of the new Third Fleet, shouldering the important responsibility of guarding Shanghai and the Yangtze River. He arrived in Shanghai today and recalled that two cycles of sixty years ago, he served as the commander of the First Overseas Dispatch Fleet in Shanghai. Now, he revisits the old place and meets with you again. In this extraordinary time when the Manchurian and Shanghai Incidents have occurred, you have worked hard for the sake of patriotism, and you also hope that Japan and China will cooperate with each other to ensure peace in the East. I will follow the general policy of the previous commander to restore the Sino-Japanese relationship to normal, but I deeply hope that the Japanese people will give their support.</p>

<h3>Feng Yuxiang Telegraphed Shanghai to Defend Zhou Lisheng's Remarks</h3>
<p>Stating He Only Visited the Forbidden City Once</p>
<p>Times Have Changed and Have Nothing to Do With Feng</p>
<p>Central Committee Member Feng Yuxiang, telegraphed Shanghai from Zhangjiakou, saying, "To the attention of all compatriots through various newspapers: Recently, I have read an article in the December 2nd issue of the Beiping World Daily and the fourth page, containing remarks by Supervisory Committee Member Zhou Lisheng regarding the investigation of the Forbidden City. Among them, it is stated that, 'According to personal opinion, the exchange of antiques is unavoidable. In the Qing Dynasty and the Feng Yuxiang era, when antiques were not registered, similar forgery malpractices were most likely to occur.' I was deeply shocked after reading it. Supervisory Committee Member Zhou Lisheng is also speaking responsibly to the press, so he should not be so vague in his words. During the expulsion of Puyi in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, although it was carried out by the National Army, the reception of the Forbidden City was handled by social groups and educators such as Mr. Li Shizeng. I only visited the Forbidden City once in the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, when the Northern Expedition was completed. How can there be a so-called 'Feng Yuxiang era'? Moreover, after the Qing Dynasty's Xuantong ruled Beijing, it went through Yuan, Li, Cao, Duan, and others, which had nothing to do with me. Even referring to the period after Puyi left the palace, those who held power in Beijing also had nothing to do with me from beginning to end, so there can be no so-called 'Feng Yuxiang era'. I am afraid that the people of the country will be misled by the words of Committee Member Zhou, so I must quickly defend myself. May the people of the country understand. Feng Yuxiang"</p>
<h3>The National Goods Association Requests the Use of National Goods</h3>
<p>Civil Servants Do Not Comply</p>
<p>Permission to People to Report</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factory Association presented to the Executive Yuan, stating, "We are submitting this to address the influx of foreign goods, earnestly requesting that you order all subordinates to use national goods in order to promote them and block loopholes. It is our humble opinion that the promotion of national goods in our country has been going on for many years, but it has still not been very effective. This is because we are only engaged in publicity and not seeking practical results. The central government has stipulated the promotion of national goods as one of the seven items of local autonomy movements. Its emphasis on national goods can be seen in general, but the civil servants of various agencies do not necessarily all use national goods. Even those who represent agencies to attend national goods exhibitions wear Western clothes and are criticized on the spot. Civil servants are role models for the people. They treat the law as if it were nothing, so it is no wonder that those who do not know better take pride in using imported goods and despise national goods like worn-out shoes. If the government can set an example and supervise its subordinates to purchase and use national goods uniformly, and punish those who dare to violate it, then the upper echelons will lead and the lower echelons will follow, and the effect will be quick. Please order all agencies and civil servants under your command to be consistent in word and deed in promoting national goods, and to implement them with practical efforts. If they do not comply, additional penalties will be stipulated, and the people will be allowed to report them."</p>
<h3>Railway Department Land Acquisition Case</h3>
<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Telegraphs Executive Yuan</p>
<p>Representatives Present to the Municipal Council</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce requests that Zhao's Garden not be acquired. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted a letter from the Flower and Tree Industry Association stating that Zhao's Garden in Pengpu District was acquired by the Ministry of Railways for the construction of the Zhenru Joint Transportation Terminal. The letter was forwarded to the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Railways, requesting that the original plan be followed so that villagers would suffer less losses. The original telegram stated, "To the Nanjing Executive Yuan's Ministry of Railways: On the 5th of this month, we received a letter from the Flower and Tree Industry Association stating that (already seen in the previous newspaper, omitted), we investigated that the construction of the joint transportation terminal on the Jinghu Road was designated to be west of Zhongshan Road and south of Jiaotong Road, and land was allocated for preparation. Although it also involves civilian property, there are no villages in that area, and the losses suffered by the people are relatively light. Now, the plan has suddenly been changed to acquire the entire Zhao's Garden village. The area is full of villagers' houses, and they plant flowers and trees for a living. The branches and trunks are rooted in the ground, and they are old and difficult to transplant. Once relocated, it is tantamount to abandoning them. The situation is different from the farmland that can be exchanged. This move is no less than depriving them of their source of food and clothing, and the situation is truly pitiful. We humbly believe that it is an unavoidable move for the country to build public utilities and acquire land, but if a way can be found to bypass it, the aim is to make the people suffer less losses. Now that there is the original acquired land available for use, then we should consider both sides and take the lesser of two evils. According to the letter, the situation is reasonable, and we hereby telegraph your department for review and approval, and to order the railway bureau to follow the original land acquisition plan so that the villagers will suffer less losses. It is for the public benefit. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce kowtows."</p>
<h3>Petition from Representatives of Villagers in Pengpu District</h3>
<p>Zhao You-ting, Hou Xuanqing, Tao Wenyuan, and other three representatives of villagers and flower and tree businesses in Pengpu District, submitted a petition to the Municipal Council, detailing the course of events and the pros and cons of the Railway Department's land acquisition. The text reads as follows: "The petition is submitted regarding the Railway Department's unauthorized requisition of civilian land for the construction of a connecting station, with the purpose of seeking profit, and requesting assistance to relieve the plight of the people. The Railway Department is implementing a fifty-year plan for the revitalization of two railway lines in Greater Shanghai, requisitioning civilian land between the Zhenru and Pengpu districts to build a connecting station. This matter concerns national construction, and the people are wholeheartedly supportive and have no grounds for objection. However, the Railway Department's plan does not take into account both national planning and the livelihood of the people, and its implementation would leave thousands of families destitute. We have repeatedly requested the administrative authorities to find ways to avoid residential areas to alleviate the people's distress. However, two months have passed, and the Railway Department has not provided a clear response, nor has it openly announced the plan in accordance with the land acquisition law. Its actions are perverse and deeply alarming. The Council, as the leader of the representatives of the citizens, has a keen understanding of the hardships of the citizens and dares to enumerate the circumstances, hoping for your consideration. It is questionable whether the Railway Department's original plan, which requires more than 7,000 mu of land, is necessary. Later, 1,400 mu of open land were found west of Zhongshan Road and south of Jiaotong Road. However, in densely populated areas, more than 700 mu were purchased. It is rumored that the reason for avoiding that area is that internal personnel have purchased a large amount of land there. Although there is no evidence to support this, such measures clearly reveal signs of malpractice. This is the first reason why the people refuse to acknowledge the construction of the connecting station. Internal and external troubles are constant, and the national treasury is empty. The people's livelihood is in decline. The people of the country are well aware of whether such large-scale construction is essential to the national economy and whether the country can afford it. The eagerness to implement the plan reveals the intention to borrow money at a discount under the guise of construction. This is the second reason why the people refuse to acknowledge the construction of the connecting station. The development of Shanghai is currently expanding towards the east and west, not the north and south. If it is said that setting up a station is enough to promote prosperity, it is doubtful whether this is possible when municipal administration has not been revitalized and the situation is not peaceful. Looking at the Shanghai-Hangzhou station in southern Shanghai and the Railway Bureau in northern Shanghai, the carriages are like clouds, and the nearby city should be thriving. However, it remains desolate, which is clear evidence. Even if it is said that the relocation of the station is a plan for fifty years later and cannot be compared to the current situation, the land will be requisitioned, the houses will be destroyed, and the basis of life will be completely destroyed. Such a large sacrifice is being made for non-essential construction. This is the third reason why the people refuse to acknowledge the construction of the connecting station. Upon careful consideration of Dr. Sun Yat-sen’s Greater Shanghai plan and the city's Public Works Bureau plan, the development of Shanghai tends towards Wusong, because both water and land transportation must be connected to promote municipal prosperity. Now that the Railway Department has set up a passenger station in Jiangwan and is building a connecting station between Zhenru and Pengpu, transportation is rather inconvenient. It would be better to set up the station in Jiangwan and connect it to the city center, which would lead to far greater development than in the interior, and would be more economical for the Railway Department itself. This is the fourth reason why the people refuse to acknowledge the construction of the connecting station. In summary, there are more than 700 households in the villages, with more than 2,000 people, who either cultivate flowers and trees or grow vegetables. They live in peace and harmony. If the plan is rashly implemented, the people will have no land to cultivate and no homes to live in, and the flowers and trees, which have been cultivated diligently for forty or fifty years or planted for six or seven years, and only yield a meager profit, will be turned to nothing. The people are willing to give their lives and offer their blood to plead with the Council to consider the people's difficulties, uphold justice, and fight for the relocation of the Railway Department, which disregards the people's situation and seizes civilian land. The people will not yield and will not give up. In submitting this petition, we cannot express our urgent desire to await your orders. Respectfully submitted to the Speaker of the Municipal Council, Shi. The petitioners are Hou Xuanqing, Zhao Youting, etc."</p>
<h3>Additional News on the Kim Cheol Case</h3>
<p>Kim Cheol Reveals Conspiracy of a Chinese Traitor</p>
<p>Choi Hye-sun Miscarries While Trying to Save Her Husband</p>
<p>Japanese Consulate Returns Property</p>
<p>The New Voice News Agency reports that regarding the case of the Japanese illegally arresting Kim Young-taek, a naturalized Korean, Kim has left Shanghai, and his son Kim Cheol yesterday again revealed the misdeeds of the Chinese traitor Huang Zhan-ying. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>(Kim's Wife Miscarries) Kim's history and residence have been previously reported. It is learned that Kim was from a wealthy Korean family, who became bankrupt due to the revolution. He lived in the Xinmin Village of the French Concession in Shanghai, where his wife Choi Hye-sun ran the Hye-sun Hospital to make a living for many years. His nephew Kim Deok-geun was arrested at the same time as Ahn Chang-ho, and his whereabouts are currently unknown. It is said that he has been taken back to Korea by the Japanese and sentenced to imprisonment, while others say that he has been secretly executed by the Japanese. When Kim Cheol was in trouble, his wife Choi Hye-sun was several months pregnant. She frantically ran to the police station and lawyers day and night, crying all night and continuing into the day. When Kim Cheol was out of danger, Choi developed a high fever and miscarried. Fortunately, Choi is skilled in medicine, and both her husband and son have escaped danger, giving her mental comfort. Although she miscarried, her body is unharmed, and she is still勉强勉强supporting herself by treating patients.</p>
<p>(Conspiracy of a Chinese Traitor) This time, the Japanese Consulate brazenly violated international law and overstepped its authority to arrest people. Although the French Consulate strongly protested, the Kim family safely escaped danger. Everyone knows that the protagonist in this case is Huang Zhan-ying. The source of Huang and the facts of his interactions with Kim Cheol in the past six months will be announced one by one to the public. The details are very complicated. According to Kim Cheol, Huang Zhan-ying and lawyer Wu Deng-yu are very close friends. While living in Wu Deng-yu's residence, Ahn Chang-ho was arrested, and Koreans in the concession fled. Huang and lawyer Wu were willing to pay a large sum of money to rent a large house in Laoximen to establish an agency for Koreans. Later, someone opposed it, saying that if the Japanese were to catch them all in one swoop, what would they do? If they wanted to help, they could give them money to leave Shanghai, so why rent a house? At that time, Korean dignitaries gathered in one place. Huang and others saw that things were not working out, and two months later, they donated 100 yuan to foreigners to complete the formalities. The location of this incident is still in Ximen, which proves their consistent strategy. Also, Huang pays 30 taels of silver per month for a room at 522 Avenue Joffre, where Wu Deng-yu's law office is listed as a contact address. All contacts are made here. When the opportunity was ripe, they moved to Ruyi Lane on Rue Lanwei. The sign of Wu Deng-yu's law office was no longer displayed, which shows its function. The person who rescued Kim Cheol day and night in this case hired lawyers Cai Xiaobai and Wu Kaisheng to negotiate with the French Consul, because these two lawyers were proficient in French and were friendly with that person. That person also escorted Kim Cheol and others out of Shanghai. When necessary, the details of this case will be made public. Kim Cheol has sent a formal letter asking that person to inquire with lawyer Wu Deng-yu to find out the whereabouts of Huang Zhan-ying. The truth will soon come to light.</p>
<p>(Blinded by Profit) According to reliable sources, Kim Cheol is a key figure in the Korean revolution and has held important positions in military affairs, transportation, and finance. The Japanese resent him deeply and have successively offered rewards of around 200,000 yuan over the years. Huang Zhan-ying and others' willingness to act as Chinese traitors is truly a case of being blinded by profit. Another message states that certain people from Guangdong followed Dr. Sun Yat-sen for many years and are veteran revolutionaries. Recently, due to political decline, they colluded with the Japanese to seek revenge. This spring, they kidnapped a pilot from Guangdong with the Japanese, and their whereabouts are unknown. They have an agency in Shanghai that outwardly opposes a certain important person, but is actually a traitorous agency. Huang Zhan-ying is also one of its members.</p>
<p>(Return of Property) The Continental Daily reports that Kim Young-taek's clothing, money, and valuables left at the Consulate General were returned to the French Concession authorities by the Japanese Consulate yesterday afternoon. The items included a gold watch, a fountain pen, a seal, an overcoat, and 560 yuan in cash. It is reported that the French authorities will temporarily preserve the items and handle them after Kim Young-taek's nationality is resolved. Although Mayor Wu notified the Japanese Consul General that Kim Young-taek has long been a Chinese citizen, the Japanese claim that Kim is Korean and still a Japanese subject. Therefore, Kim's nationality has become an issue. Regarding the return of Kim's money and valuables, it is reported that many members of the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the French Concession submitted a request to the French Consul General for negotiation on Monday afternoon.</p>

<p>Li Shiyong The First Route Commander of the Jilin National Salvation Army, under Tian Lin, has been in revolt in Jiaohe since May 1 of this year, destroying the Jitun and Laha roads six times, annihilating over a hundred enemies, and seizing many weapons. However, due to the harsh environment of cold weather and ice, with only meager clothing and ammunition, it is difficult to contend with the Japanese invaders. On October 23, the regiment dispatched Li Shiyong and Zhang Yuchun as representatives to the interior to report to the government and request assistance from the people. The head of the Peiping Liaojihei People’s Relief Association, Zhu Qinglan, has conducted a thorough investigation to confirm the facts. He has granted them recognition and promised to allocate 20,000 yuan, sending personnel to express condolences. However, this payment has not yet been made.

<p>Robbery of a Cigarette and Paper Shop, Two Female Customers Shot Dead</p>
<h3>Shouting "Catch the Robber" Resulted in a Tragic Death on the Spot</h3>
<p>丨The Robbers Were Murderous...Not Uttering a Word丨</p>
<p>A robbery occurred in Xian Gua Street outside the South City the night before. The victim was the Yongtai Chang cigarette and paper shop. A total of more than 100 yuan was robbed. The robbers shot and killed a female customer before leaving. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Three Robbers Break into Cigarette and Paper Shop Zhang Yaoting, a native of Zhenjiang, runs the Yongtai Chang cigarette and paper shop at No. 42, opposite Xingren Lane, Xian Gua Street outside Xiaodongmen. At around 8:00 PM the night before, three robbers suddenly arrived. One robber was wearing a blue cloth short shirt and pants, and the other two robbers were wearing black short shirts and pants. All were around 30 years old. One of the robbers in the blue cloth short shirt and pants jumped over the counter into the shop, took out a pistol, and warned not to make a sound. The other two robbers stood outside the door as lookouts.</p>
<p>A Woman Holds Silver to Exchange One of the robbers in the shop grabbed more than 50 yuan in banknotes and more than 600 jiao in small silver coins from the drawer of the account table. At that time, Zhang and the people in the shop were all stunned and let the robbers search. Peng Zuo, a 21-year-old woman from Huai'an, lived in the Yangshupu area of ​​eastern Shanghai. She had recently come to her mother's house in Laotaiping Lane in the South City to linger for a few days. After dinner the night before, she planned to go to Xiaodongmen to buy goods. When walking through Xingren Lane, she suddenly realized that she was lacking in small change, so she held a silver dollar to Yongtai Chang for exchange.</p>
<p>Peng Zuo Dies from Gunshot Wound At the same time, the robber in the blue cloth short shirt and pants happened to get the banknotes and jumped out of the counter with the loot. He suddenly saw the woman standing by the counter and planned to rob the silver dollar in her hand. The woman was shocked and shouted "Catch the robber!" Unexpectedly, as soon as she finished speaking, the robber pulled the trigger. There was a loud bang, and the woman fell to the ground from the gunshot. The bullet entered from the front chest and came out from the back. Blood was flowing profusely, and she fainted from the pain. The robbers fled in all directions after seeing the bloody case.</p>
<p>Police Officers Patrol but Find Nothing Zhang Tingju, the police officer in the 25th guard post near the area, was standing at his post when he suddenly heard gunshots. He immediately came to the source of the sound. At this time, the district chief of the district also rushed to the scene with district staff after hearing the report, and patrolled everywhere, but the robbers had gone far away, so they found nothing. The police sent the injured to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. However, the injury was fatal, and she died before she could be treated. Yesterday, the local police reported to the Shanghai District Court for an autopsy.</p>
<p>The Bandits Learned the Silent Ways of the Jin People When the robbers were robbing, they never spoke a word, but glared with murderous intent and searched and robbed in one fell swoop. It can also be said to be a unique aspect of the robbery case.</p>
<p>After Zhang Shiming's Death, the Disturbance周妙英Obtains the Final Victory</p>
<h3>Qu'an and Miaoying are Definitely Mother and Son, the Supreme Court Reverses the Judgments of the Previous Two Trials</h3>
<p>The late Zhang Shiming, a wealthy man from Nanxun, married Zhou Miaoying, a woman from Suzhou, as his concubine, and had a son named Qu'an, who ranked ninth. After Kouming's death, Miaoying and the main wife, Xu, disagreed, so she rented a house to live in, while Qu'an was raised by Xu. The Xu family married their niece to him two years ago. Because they were afraid that Miaoying would come out to obstruct the marriage, they also kept the marriage secret. Afterwards, Miaoying found out and filed a lawsuit against Qu'an and Zhang Xu, asking to confirm the relationship between mother and son. During the first trial, the defendants presented evidence that Zhou Miaoying had taken 40,000 yuan as a fee to sever the relationship. As a result, Zhou Miaoying lost the lawsuit. Zhou refused to accept it and appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court, but suffered another defeat. Zhou then hired lawyer Yuan Yang'an to file an appeal with the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has investigated and ruled that the judgments of the previous two trials shall be reversed, and that Zhou Miaoying and Zhang Qu'an are indeed related as mother and son. The judgment is recorded below:</p>
<p>(Main text) The original judgment and the first trial judgment are both reversed. It is confirmed that the appellant Zhang Qu'an still has a mother-son relationship. The litigation costs of all levels of trial shall be borne by the defendant and appellant. (Reason) The appellant Zhang Qu'an in this case was originally the son of the appellant when she was Zhang Shiming's concubine. The appellant now claims that after she gave birth to Qu'an, Zhang Shiming remarried Zhang Xu as</p>
<p>her successor. She was abused and not allowed to live together. She forced Shiming to die in the 16th year of the Republic of China. Xu actually包園包園Qu'an, not allowing him to communicate with the appellant. Later, she订婚订婚 Qu'an without letting the appellant know about it. She requested that the relationship between the appellant and Qu'an be confirmed as mother and son. According to the regulations of Article 287 of the Civil Procedure Regulations cited by the previous court in Jiangsu Province, a lawsuit to confirm the establishment or non-establishment of a legal relationship cannot be filed unless the plaintiff has a legal interest in the confirmation judgment (Article 238, Paragraph 1 of the Civil Procedure Law has the same provisions). This type of confirmation lawsuit is originally based on the fact that the existence of the legal relationship is unclear. In this case, the fact that the appellant Zhang Qu'an is the biological son of the appellant is not denied by him. According to the law, even if the mother breaks away from the relationship with the father, the son she bears has no duty to sever the relationship with the mother. Therefore, the relationship between mother and son is still existing according to the law. However, the appellant argued in the first trial and repeatedly claimed that the appellant had long severed the relationship with the family of Shi Ming and had voluntarily signed an agreement in the 17th year of the Republic of China, giving her 40,000 yuan as a severance fee for everything related to the biological mother who had left the family, so there was no longer any relationship to speak of, etc. By the time of the original trial, when the appellant's agent asked whether she admitted that she was the biological mother, Zhang Qu'an did not answer. This can be proved by the record. Therefore, whether the mother-son relationship between the appellant Zhang Qu'an and the appellant should continue to exist is clearly still in dispute and is not clear. It cannot be said that the appellant has no need to file a confirmation lawsuit. However, the court only determined that the mother-son relationship had been established because the appellant did not fundamentally deny that the appellant was the mother. The lawsuit was dismissed. The appeal in the second trial still upheld the judgment of the first trial dismissing the lawsuit. The legal views are difficult to consider in agreement. Also, the appellant listed the appellant Zhang Xu as a defendant in the lawsuit, saying that Zhang Qu'an's failure to recognize the appellant as his mother was caused by her deception. Whether the claim is true or not is aside, but it cannot be said that the lawsuit is illegal. The original judgment also misunderstood this point. The appellant requested to reverse the judgments of the first and second trials and make another judgment. It cannot be said that there is no reason. Based on the above discussion and conclusion, the appeal in this case is justified. The judgment is made in accordance with Article 444, Paragraph 1 and Article 446, Section 1 of the Civil Procedure Law, as stated in the main text. Presiding Judge of the Second Civil Tribunal of the Supreme Court, Lin Dingcao, judges耿·Jiang Fukun·Tang Benyin·Lin Zusheng. Clerk Yang Shuyun.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Vehicle Hits and Kills a Chinese Pedestrian</h3>
<p>Witness Said the Vehicle Was Driving Very Fast</p>
<p>At around 1:00 PM the day before yesterday, near Hua Ji Road on Broadway Road, a vehicle driven by a Japanese hit an unknown man, who fell to the ground and died shortly after. The body was ordered by the Huishan Police Station to be transported to the morgue on Ferron Road for an autopsy. It is learned that the vehicle belonged to the Japanese Army Department, and the vehicle number was 5742. The driver was a Japanese, Hideo, who was appointed by the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Prosecutor Zhan Liangce came to the morgue, confirmed the body, and opened the case. According to Hideo, 25 years old, he claimed that his car was traveling from west to east to deliver a letter. At that time, the person was walking on the street in the same direction. Later, he suddenly turned south and intended to cross the road, causing my car to hit him. According to the witness Huang Fubao, he worked as a clerk in a rice store at No. 807 Broadway Road. At that time, I was at the entrance of the store, and the scene of the accident was about three storefronts away from me. I saw the car driving very fast, and the deceased was walking from south to north when he was hit by the car. Mr. Zhan then ruled that the body of the unknown man had been hit by car number 5742 and died from a head injury. No family was found, and the body was handed over to the Pushan Villa for burial. The driver, Hideo, is suspected of negligence and should be investigated and dealt with by the police.</p>
<h3>The Case of Human-Dog Intercourse</h3>
<p>Chen Xinzhai Appeals Against the Original Sentence</p>
<p>Final Hearing Held Yesterday, Sentencing Scheduled</p>
<p>Chen Xinzhai, residing at No. 12, Hongfu Lane, Xinzha Road, works at the Tianyun Tower of the Wing On Company as a diablo performer. His concubine, Chen Lu, has four adopted daughters: Chen Shuanglin, 11 years old; Gui Lin, 8 years old; and Gen Ling and Caiyun, both 6 years old. They are usually taught to sing opera and perform at the New World Company. In July of this year, Detective Sergeant Tang Jian of the Xinzha Police Station discovered that the Chens were taking the four adopted daughters and a small black dog to various hotels within the settlement to perform human-dog sexual acts for profit, an act that harmed public morals. He went to the Chen residence and took the Chens, suspect Liu Xin'san, the four girls, and the small black dog, along with drug paraphernalia, to the police station. Investigations revealed that the Chens had repeatedly taken the humans and the dog to perform at major hotels such as the Oriental, Da Zhonghua, and Shenzhou, with each spectator paying five yuan. The four children were sent to the hospital, where it was confirmed that their hymens were broken. They were then sent to the First Special District Court, where they confessed clearly after repeated interrogations. Judge Wu Tingqi sentenced Chen Xinzhai and Chen Lu to ten years of imprisonment each, acquitted Liu Xin'san, confiscated the drug paraphernalia and dog, and sent the four children to the Jiliang Institute for care. This has been reported in our newspaper before. However, the Chens were dissatisfied with the verdict and hired lawyer Gan Lin to appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court. Their appeal focused solely on the charge of offending public morals, while they expressed agreement with the confiscation of the drug paraphernalia. Yesterday afternoon, Criminal Court President Yu Hua of the Second Branch of the High Court, along with Judges Luo and Guo, presided over the hearing. Lawyer Wang Yaotang represented the police station. President Yu stated that this case concerned public morals, so he ordered that no spectators be allowed. He then asked Chen Xinzhai for the reasons for his dissatisfaction with the first instance verdict. Chen denied any obscene behavior, claiming that the doctors found only abrasions in the girls' lower bodies, but no broken hymens. He argued that the girls were taught opera and practiced techniques, and their lower bodies could easily be scratched inadvertently. He stated that there was no improper behavior. The testimonies of Chen Lu, witness Liu Xin'san, and the child Chen Shuanglin were largely the same as their testimonies in the first instance, so they were omitted. Finally, after arguments between police lawyer Wang Yaotang and appellant's lawyer Gan Lin, President Yu adjourned the hearing and scheduled the sentencing for next Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<h3>A Record of the National Government's Flood Relief Committee's Inspection of the Completed Dike Project (10)</h3>
<p>(Zhang Gong Dike in Hankou) Jiang Xinshu arrived in Hankou at 6:00 AM on December 3rd. Representatives from the Hubei Provincial Government and public organizations, as well as Public Security Bureau Chief Chen Xizeng, greeted him at the dock. A welcoming arch was erected along the riverbank. The Public Security Bureau and the Provincial Government military band, along with armed police and soldiers, provided music and guarded the dock. More than twenty cars were prepared for the members to ride in. At 9:00 AM, the entire group disembarked and rode in cars along the riverbank to inspect the Hankou riverfront flood control dike. It is a concrete and rebar structure, about seven English miles long, extending from the Customs Wharf to Shenjiaji. It is about four meters wide. The river-facing side is built with stones, and the top is made of water-resistant mortar with iron railings. It is both extremely sturdy and aesthetically pleasing. The dike surface is paved with yellow sand, forming a perfect road. According to Engineering Bureau Chief Yang Silian, the stone used for this section of the project was all transported from Henan, resulting in high costs. The total cost was over 300,000 yuan. It serves as Hankou's front barrier. From Shenjiaji onward, it becomes Zhang Gong Dike, protecting the back of Hankou, extending twelve and a half kilometers. The two dikes connect to form a large circle, with the entire city of Hankou residing safely within. If the dikes are well maintained and protected, Hankou can expect to be free from floods forever. The members walked and rode along the way, praising the beauty of the dike. The cars traveled along the dike, and after passing Shenjiaji, they entered Zhang Gong Dike. The surface of Zhang Gong Dike is even wider than the flood control dike, about seven meters wide. The side facing the water is also a stone slope. The cleanliness of the road proves the diligence of the authorities in maintaining the dike. Halfway along Zhang Gong Dike, they got off the cars at Gusushu, a small town with densely packed thatched huts. A simple welcoming arch was erected, and every household hung the national flag in welcome. The Provincial Government and public organizations set up tents and long tables on the dike to serve tea to the members. Hubei Provincial Government Chairman Xia Douyin and representatives from the Hubei Flood Relief Committee also personally attended to welcome them. Shortly after, they boarded the cars again and traveled along the dike, winding into the city, stopping in front of the Hankou Orphanage. Commissioner Li led them inside for a tour. It was already 10:30 AM.</p>
<p>(Visiting the Orphanage) The Hankou Orphanage is located in the original Charity Association building. The buildings are quite large, and there are currently 340 orphans, about 90 of whom are girls. The oldest is 17 years old, and the youngest is 6 years old. It was officially established on October 1st of this year. Chen Jiyu, the Deputy Director of the Hubei Flood Relief Committee, serves as the Director of the orphanage. There are over 20 faculty and staff members. The daily operating expenses are about 3,000 yuan, subsidized by the Flood Relief Committee and other charitable organizations. Director Chen led them on a tour of the various facilities, including the orphanage workshops, where the orphans are taught various small crafts such as wicker weaving, rope making, and embroidery. The girls wear blue cotton-padded uniforms and blue cloth hats, and they are very lively. There is a children's farm for practical cultivation, and a children's city government for orphans to practice self-governance. They also visited the dormitories, classrooms, and dining hall. All the arrangements were well-organized and clean, suitable for children to live in. The walls were covered with pictures depicting common etiquette and knowledge, such as "Do not make noise while eating," "Wash your hands before eating," and "Walk slowly on the stairs and do not speak loudly." There is also a Boy Scout organization, wearing yellow cloth military uniforms. They have a headquarters and a lookout tower, and the sentries are only seven or eight years old, but they know how to salute. Xia Douyin praised them after the tour. At 12:00 PM, there was a gathering in the auditorium. Chu Minyi, Xia Douyin, and Sun Faxu all gave sincere speeches, encouraging the orphans. Finally, Commissioner Li gave a detailed report on the establishment of the orphanage. At 1:00 PM, they returned to the Yangtze River Hotel for lunch. At 2:00 PM, the entire group crossed the river to Wuchang to inspect the Wu-Jing Dike. At 8:00 PM, they were invited by the Hubei Provincial Government and the Hubei Flood Relief Committee to a banquet at the Golden City Bank Building.</p>
<p>(Li Zushen Initiates) The orphans in the orphanage are all orphans of families affected by last year's floods. The original initiator was Commissioner Li Zushen of the National Flood Relief Committee. In September of last year, he started the Shanghai Zhabei Flood Orphans Shelter and invited the China Child Welfare Association to handle the childcare work. The Association set up four departments: education, nutrition, health, and recreation. General Secretary Wu Weide personally went to Wuhu, Jiujiang, and Hankou in November of last year to investigate the situation of the affected children. At that time, nearly 260,000 disaster victims were sheltered near Wuhan, and the number of affected children accounted for about one-third. About 4,000 children were completely without parents. At that time, the weather was suddenly cold, and the Flood Relief Committee's finances were very tight. They had no choice but to cancel the provision of four liters of rice per disaster victim, half for the disaster children, as resettlement funds. Since the disaster victims had nowhere to go, incidents of selling disaster children occurred. Wu heard about this and consulted Commissioner Li Zushen, proposing to donate funds to establish an orphanage to shelter the disaster children. Li strongly urged its success and took out 4,000 yuan from his own pocket as start-up funds. With the support of General Zhu Ziqiao, the Wuhan Disaster Orphans Education and Care Center of the China Child Welfare Association was established in Wuchang in late December. Li Zushen was appointed as the honorary director, and Wu Weide served as the director. The China Child Welfare Association, the National Flood Relief Committee, the Hubei Flood Relief Committee, the Shanghai YMCA, the National Association, the Wuchang YMCA, Wuhan University, the Shanghai National Medical College, and Huazhong University in Wuchang were invited as initiators to cooperate in the operation. Initially, 300 orphans were sheltered. About 200 orphans were later claimed by their families, and the project was completely closed by the end of the year. All the property and 135 disaster children were transferred to the current orphanage, expanding its scale to what it is today. It is heard that a board of directors is currently being organized to raise funds, hoping to make it permanent. When the League of Nations Investigation Team visited Hankou, they visited the orphanage founded by Li, and Lord Lytton expressed his appreciation, saying to Commissioner Li Zushen, "You are truly someone who can make a great contribution to the country." When Commissioner Li accompanied the entire group on the tour this time, the Tai orphans were all familiar with him. When they saw Li, they shouted "Mr. Li" and rushed forward, as if they were family members. Li is a truly enthusiastic person, and his contribution to benefiting society is undeniable.</p>
<p>(A Glimpse of the Wu-Jing Dike) The Hankou flood control dike was built by the Hubei Flood Relief Committee, and Zhang Gong Dike originally belonged to the Fifth District project but was handled by the Hubei Flood Relief Committee. At 2:00 PM, the entire group crossed the river to Wuchang. After landing at Baishazhou and walking several hundred paces, they reached the Wu-Jing Dike. The dike is an earthen dike, ten meters wide, allowing two cars to drive side by side. It is twenty kilometers long, stretching from Jingkou in the west to Wuchang in the east. The project is extremely sturdy and is one of the main dike projects in Hubei. They returned to Hankou at 5:00 PM. (Money Hua reported from Hankou on the evening of December 3rd)</p>

<h3>More Than a Hundred Prominent Figures Initiate a Public Memorial Service for Xu Yutang</h3>
<p>January 3rd at the Buddhist Pure Land Society</p>
<p>Wang Xia, Xiong Xiling, Zhu Chenlan, Wu Tiecheng, Ye Gongchuo, Zheng Hongnian, and 126 others jointly initiated a public memorial service for Mr. Xu Yutang, the grandfather of Mr. Xu Jingren, on January 3rd next year. The invitation distributed yesterday stated: "Respectfully informing you, Taiqiu's virtue moved 30,000 mourners, and the esteemed elder lived in seclusion until the age of 104. Moreover, he belonged to the prestigious Ruying clan and was deservedly recognized as the blessed star of Anhui. Like Mr. Xu Jingren's grandfather, Mr. Yutang, in Qiupu, his hidden virtue remained fragrant, and his spirit did not fade away. He built nests in the misty caves, his beauty rivaling that of Shen Liao. He rectified customs in front of the Zhongxin Hall, his teachings bequeathing stability. Zhang Cun showed filial piety, scattered silken brocades. Zeng Gong was kind and gentle, caring for his four younger brothers and nine younger sisters. He was granted the honor of being presented with a walking stick, no different from the elders of the Lu Kingdom. He had the vision to eat coarse rice, no less than the sincerity of Zhongxuan. Heaven ended his spiritual journey, becoming a guest in the Tushita Heaven. The world commonly praised him as someone from whom teachings could be requested, as someone destined for the Buddhist realm. We await the auspicious events. Zhao Duanming had great writings, even more admirable than the three generations of the Jin Tangs, with many virtuous descendants like Han Wei'gong. Mr. Jingren, following the earnest instructions of his will, avoided the common rituals of the floating world. He trained himself to be thrifty and determined to be cautious to the end. We have long admired his virtues and share in the sorrow. Therefore, we have decided to set up a public memorial service at the Buddhist Pure Land Society on Hede Road in Shanghai on January 3, 1933, which is the eighth day of the twelfth lunar month of the Ren Shen year. We will piously recite the true scriptures, hoping for his rebirth in the Buddhist realm and looking forward to the destruction of the main tomb in Teng Lu. We will be respectful and sincere in our offerings, reverently paying homage to the spirits of the tall mountains and lofty peaks. We dare to prepare a dignified burial and respectfully await the arrival of vehicles and horses, using elegies to forever express our sorrow. We respectfully inform you and offer our regards. We hope you will consider.

<p>Responsible committee members were appointed for each group.</p>
<p>The Chicago Exposition's Chinese photography submissions, previously entrusted to the China Travel Service by the Preparatory Committee to handle collection, have been reported in this newspaper. It is now known that the company has spared no effort since taking over the project. In addition to notifying each branch to collect as much as possible within the deadline, they have also sent letters to archaeologists and photographers in the country to solicit contributions and plan to expand publicity.

The address is still the Shanghai Bank Library. To improve work efficiency, the committee members decided to form groups to be responsible for the tasks to facilitate progress. The responsible committee members for each group are listed below: (1) Scenic spots group, responsible person: China Travel Service; (2) Ancient sites and antiquities group with historical or artistic value, responsible person: Mr. Xia Jiancheng (with the assistance of Mr. Ye Yufu and Mr. Zheng Wuchang); (3) Ancient and modern famous buildings group, responsible person: Mr. Ye Yufu (with the assistance of Mr. Jiang Xiaojian); (4) Modern new construction group, responsible person: Mr. Shao Xunmei (with the assistance of Mr. Jiang Xiaojian); (5) Objects and customs group that can be used for academic reference, responsible person: Mr. Song Chunfang; (6) Fine art photography works group, responsible person: Mr. Lang Jingshan. It is also heard that all external affairs, such as drafting and sending letters, will still be handled directly by the China Travel Service, and contributors who need to communicate should also send their letters directly to the company.</p>

<h3>Counterfeiting of National Goods by Imitating Chinese Cloth Trademarks</h3>
<p>Wujin Dyeing and Weaving Guild</p>
<p>Sends Personnel to Shanghai for Investigation</p>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reports that the National General Chamber of Commerce sent a letter yesterday to the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Bureau of Social Affairs, stating: "We are writing to you regarding a letter received from the Wujin County Chamber of Commerce in Jiangsu. The letter from Xu Hankang, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the local Dyeing and Weaving Industry Guild, states that the products of our guild are sold to various provinces and are shipped through Shanghai. Since the boycott of foreign goods, Japanese merchants, seeing the popularity of domestic goods, have colluded with unscrupulous merchants to counterfeit national goods trademarks. This has been discovered repeatedly and has even been the subject of lawsuits. If this continues, it will not only affect the future of national goods, but also render the boycott efforts futile. After repeated discussions, our guild members agreed that it is difficult to investigate these matters from a distance. Therefore, it is necessary to establish an office in Shanghai for the Wujin Dyeing and Weaving Factories to send personnel to investigate. If counterfeiting of trademarks is discovered, we can report it to the authorities for investigation and handling at any time. We are writing to your association to request your review and to inform the county government to forward the information to the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs for record. We are also writing to the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce to request them to forward the information to various agencies for their attention."</p>
<p>"In view of the fact that the counterfeiting of trademarks of cloth manufacturers in our county has occurred frequently and has been reported in the past, and that the guild considers it necessary to establish an office in Shanghai for the purpose of preventing such abuses, promoting the sale of domestic products, and facilitating investigation, we are submitting this letter to your association. We request that you forward it to the Municipal Government and Bureau to protect national goods and prevent counterfeiting. We value our public relationship."</p>
<p>"We are therefore writing to your government and bureau, requesting your attention to this matter."</p>
<h3>A Record of the Regular Meeting of the Shanghai Branch of the Association of Chinese Engineers</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Association of Chinese Engineers held its regular meeting at 6 p.m. on the 28th of last month at the Bank Association at No. 4 Hong Kong Road. Forty-eight people attended, including Mr. Wang Shengzu. They first had a dinner, and then the president, Mr. Xu Peihuang, reported on the election of this branch. Following this, Mr. Qiu Lin (transliteration), manager of the Victory Company, gave a lecture on the method of manufacturing gramophone records. Mr. Qiu also brought the company's gramophone and recording machine for a demonstration. The sound was very clear and pleasant, and the lecture was very detailed, providing valuable information for engineers.</p>
<p>President Xu then proposed that, as the association has many members, it is difficult for new and old members to get to know each other. Even after introductions at branch meetings, they often do not know each other's names, which is not ideal. To remedy this, he proposed making name badges to be distributed to members at the next meeting to help them recognize each other. The members present unanimously agreed, and Mr. Dong Dagang is actively drawing up a design. The meeting adjourned after ten o'clock.</p>
<h3>Circular from the Mechanical Industry Association to its Members</h3>
<p>Abolishing Previously Issued Certificates of National Goods</p>
<p>And Establishing Provisional Transportation Certificates</p>
<p>A letter from the Shanghai Mechanical National Goods Factories Association to its member factories states: "Regarding the certificates of national goods that our association has been issuing, since the September 18th Incident, the call to resist Japan and save the nation has grown. Member factories have requested certificates for proof, but there have been irregularities. These national goods certificates are permanent, and if we are not careful, they may be used by unscrupulous merchants for fraudulent purposes, which would greatly affect the interests of our members. The Standing Committee of our association has considered this and decided to invalidate all existing national goods certificates. In the future, members who need certification for transporting national goods can obtain provisional certificates from the association by submitting an application. This will ensure proper management."</p>
<p>"In addition to announcing the invalidation of the certificates in the newspaper, we are enclosing a blank application form for your information."</p>
<p>The Ningbo Fellow-Villagers Association Sends a Letter Requesting Protection of Chen Song's Property Rights</p>
<h3>Where the Floodwaters Reach is All Sandy Land; Without Property Protection, the People Cannot Live in Peace</h3>
<p>The Old Ningbo Shatian Sub-Bureau's handling of the Shatian reclamation project is not following the proper procedures. Land that matured hundreds of years ago and has been managed by the people for a long time is being included in the reclamation area. Land with legal deeds and registration certificates is being sold off without proper notification, citing overdue registration and payment. The number of such cases is unknown, and the public is in an uproar. It is reported that the Ningbo Fellow-Villagers Association in Shanghai sent a letter to the Yin County government yesterday regarding the illegal handling of Chen Song's property by the sub-bureau, stating: "Mr. Chen Yeqiao, a member of our association, owns 5.38 mu of land (according to the Shatian Sub-Bureau's re-measurement, it is 5.12 mu) in the name of Chen Songfang, located in Dongba No. 8 Tu of Yin County. He has built a house on it and lived there for more than ten years, holding a stamped deed and having registered it with the Ningbo Municipal Government Land Bureau. Last November, the house was unfortunately destroyed by fire, and Mr. Chen and his family temporarily moved elsewhere, losing touch with the land. Unexpectedly, in September of this year, the land was reportedly auctioned off by the Shatian Sub-Bureau for over 400 yuan. Mr. Chen entrusted our association to find a way to request the county magistrate to instruct the Shatian Sub-Bureau to withdraw the auction and protect his property rights. Now, Mr. Chen claims that the land has been managed and housed for many years and is completely different from sandy mudflats. The Shatian Sub-Bureau has refused the original owner's request for restoration, citing overdue payment, which is an unfair act. On November 25th, they posted a notice at the door of Chen Songfang's house allowing Zhang Lingrong, a representative of Song Ji, to demarcate the land for management, which is alarming. If this kind of action by the Shatian Sub-Bureau is not corrected, then where the floodwaters reach is all sandy land. The people cannot live in peace without property protection. This is probably not the government's original intention in reclaiming the Shatian."</p>
<p>"Therefore, we earnestly request that you investigate and provide legal relief to protect property rights."</p>
<p>Rev. Yu Zongzhou Memorial Service</p>
<h3>Organized by Xie Yongqin</h3>
<p>"Since Christianity was introduced to China over a century ago, its influence and number of followers have been widely recognized. However, church affairs have always relied on foreign influence and unequal treaties to preach in the interior and establish a foundation. This has aroused the resentment of the Chinese people. In the 32nd year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, Yu Zongzhou, a pastor of the Presbyterian Church, from Ningbo, Zhejiang, believed that Christianity should be shared by all mankind and that China could accept it. However, it was unacceptable to use unequal treaties to protect the church. Therefore, he and his comrades Chai Lianfu, Chen Ao, Lin Hongbin, Zhu Baoluo, Xie Yongqin, Lin Meichuan, Fan Zhidu, Zhu Lianqing, and Pang Zixian organized the National General Association of the Jesus Self-Supporting Church in Shanghai. They established over 300 branches in provinces, cities, counties, and overseas Chinese communities to achieve the long-held goal of self-propagation, self-support, and self-governance. Christian groups in other provinces followed suit and broke away from Western influence to realize an indigenous Chinese church. Mr. Yu's contribution is truly significant."</p>
<p>"Although Mr. Yu was 80 years old this year, he was still in good spirits and had much to contribute. However, he fell ill on the 15th of last month and passed away the next morning. The news shocked the nation. His family held a funeral at the International Funeral Home on the 26th of the same month and temporarily placed his coffin in the Siming Guild Hall, as reported in the previous newspaper. It is now reported that the association, in recognition of Mr. Yu's service to the church, his efforts in self-reliance, and his hard work, which benefited the world, and his dedication to social causes, has decided to hold a memorial service on January 8th of next year to express their condolences. Mr. Xie Yongqin has been appointed as the chairman of the preparatory committee to oversee all preparations. The association stated that anyone who admires Mr. Yu's life and wishes to express their respect should send condolences and elegies to the association's office at No. 117 Sida Lane, Shikuta Road, North Sichuan Road, Shanghai, by the end of December so that they can be published in a special memorial issue."</p>
<h3>The Notorious Bandit Did Not Commit Crimes in Shanghai</h3>
<p>But Committed Kidnapping and Murder in Shaoxing</p>
<p>Awaiting the Zhejiang Security Team to Bring Documents to Shanghai for Extradition</p>
<p>Hua Detective Su Changsheng and Detective Zhou Guisen of the Laozha Police Station previously arrested the notorious bandit Chen Zhaoyuan (also known as Ni Si) from Shaoxing, along with Yuan Guanggeng, Yuan Diancai, Ma Zhengcai, Lu Zhenggong, and women Chen Hu, Yuan Wang, Chen Sanfeng, and Jin Wang, at Dongyouheng Road. They confiscated a pistol with fifty rounds of ammunition and over 8,000 yuan. They were handed over to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. The police have now found that Chen and the other criminals committed major crimes such as kidnapping for ransom and murder in Shaoxing. They did not commit any crimes in this city. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Special Court. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated that the Zhejiang Provincial Government Security Team has requested the extradition of the criminals in this case. The female criminals do not need to be extradited. Members of the Security Team have returned to the province to prepare documents and will arrive in Shanghai in one or two days. He requested that the case be postponed, that the female criminals be released first, and that the remaining criminals be detained. The presiding judge approved the request and ordered the four female criminals, including Hu Chen, to be released first. Chen Zhaoqi and the other five were returned to custody for further interrogation at a later date.</p>
<h3>Only Son Dies Tragically</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at around 10:30 a.m., Wang Xing, the owner of the Jiuchang Ironworks in Zhuangyuanda Lane, Hongkou, whose native place is Ningbo, had an only son named Yiwen, who was two years old. An apprentice, Zhu Shichang (13 years old), took him to play in the middle of the road. A horse-drawn carriage No. 180 from the Ma Carriage Company on Ti'an Bridge Maohai Road came speeding along. They were unable to avoid it in time, and the two children were knocked to the ground. Zhu's head and legs were injured, and Yiwen's skull was crushed. He was dying. A patrol officer arrived and took the injured children to Tongren Hospital. Because Yiwen's injuries were too severe, he was transferred to Guangren Hospital, where he died.</p>
<h3>Electrical Manufacturing Industry Organizes Guild</h3>
<p>Initiated by Hu Xiyuan and Others</p>
<p>Approved by the Municipal Party Headquarters</p>
<p>There are dozens of factories in Shanghai that manufacture electrical appliances. There has been no contact or organization among the businesses. Therefore, when foreign goods are dumped and attacked, they are often unable to resist because they are not united and are defeated one by one. Now, Hu Xiyuan and others in the industry have initiated the organization of a trade association. In September, they submitted a request to the Municipal Party Headquarters for registration. Due to the central government's revision of various laws and regulations, approval was delayed. Now, Hu Xiyuan and others have received a reply from the Municipal Party Headquarters, which reads: "Reply No. 189 of the Chinese Kuomintang Committee: Reply to the request of Hu Xiyuan and others to organize the Shanghai Electrical Manufacturing Industry Trade Association, with attached resumes. Having examined the submitted documents, the request is approved for registration, and a permit will be issued. Please send a representative to the headquarters to collect the permit." It is reported that the initiators have already collected the permit and are starting to prepare for the organization of the guild.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Federation Held a Regular Meeting Yesterday</h3>

<p>1.  Sending representatives to guide the establishment of the 8th District Branch. It was decided to send Zhang Yichen to attend.</p>
<p>2.  Revising regulations for reducing and exempting rent.

<h3>Reader's Advisor</h3>
<p>(1) Discussion Regarding Ms. Zhang Yunqiu's Question</p>
<p>丨See December 3rd of this column</p>
<p>Mr. Shu Xiwu's message: (1) Due to men's inferior nature of liking the new and disliking the old, and women's inability to be independent, (2) women must strive for independence, otherwise they must endure considerably.</p>
<p>Mr. Cheng Jingjin's message: (1) For example, today the cook roasts a chicken. The first time we eat it, we feel it tastes very good. If it's like this tomorrow, and still like this the day after tomorrow, we will feel it's tasteless. The love between husband and wife drops from boiling point to freezing point, which is the same principle. (2) We must advocate "Husband and Wife Sunday Meetings," that is, the husband and wife live apart. Every Sunday, the two agree on a location to meet, and after this day, they each go to work separately.</p>
<p>Mr. Dai Kejian's message: (1) Approximately five reasons: (1) incompatible personalities, (2) the other person is ugly, (3) difficult living conditions, (4) the husband is unfaithful, or the wife is gluttonous and lazy, (5) after having children, the children divide the husband's love. (2) Must accept fate, must forgive each other, must be able to live in peace in wealth, and stick together in poverty.</p>
<p>(2) A Letter That Can Be Used as a Reference for Ms. Zhang Yunqiu</p>
<p>Ms. Shi Ziwo's message: I have only been married for four years and have very little experience. I am not qualified to participate in the discussion of the major issue of love after marriage raised by Ms. Zhang Yunqiu. However, my experience is completely opposite to that of Ms. Zhang, and I have already passed the critical stage (i.e., one or two years of marriage), so I am willing to contribute my own experience to the public. My husband was initially introduced by my father. When we first met, it wasn't like what people say, "love at first sight." Although he is only five years older than me, his appearance is older than his age, especially when he frowns and thinks. Therefore, I said to my father, "He could be my old uncle." But my father liked him very much and said many words praising him. To please my father, I reluctantly arranged a time to talk with him. Who knew that after talking, my impression of him changed, and I felt that he was a rare "comrade" of mine. His views and thoughts were completely the same as mine. It wasn't that he deliberately accommodated my meaning; at that time, I was just asking questions; he answered. We talked several times, gradually developing love from respect, and becoming a couple from respect and love. We believe that our love now is stronger and sweeter than when we got married four years ago. As for how to achieve a happy result, it is difficult to explain in detail, but analyzing it, there are several principles. Marriage is related to lifelong happiness. When we got married, we decided to do our best to make our life happy, just like what Shanghainese call "being husband and wife." We never thought, what if married life fails? If there is any dissatisfaction, we will try to resolve it frankly and not let the situation escalate.</p>
<p>I never compare my husband with others, because such comparisons are harmful and not beneficial.</p>
<p>Married life is very different from life before marriage, especially in terms of sexual desire. We were prepared for this change in life. We completely followed the guidance of the Englishman Stopes. We both carefully read his book "Married Love" (Marie Stopes: Married Love, there is a translated version of this book on the market), and we discussed all the questions raised in the book.</p>
<p>We both try our best to avoid all things that cause jealousy or misunderstanding. Even so, small disagreements between husband and wife sometimes occur. There was a time when we argued almost every day. Later, we agreed that neither of us should lose our temper. After that, when a disagreement occurred, we would say, "Didn't we agree not to lose our temper?" Once this was said, neither of us wanted to continue arguing. Another method is to understand each other. I want to believe that if he loses his temper, he is not losing it at me, he still loves me, maybe he was upset by someone outside, or he is not feeling well: I should comfort him. He treats me the same way. When women are menstruating, their tempers are irritable, and they often become pessimistic over trivial matters; so when we encounter menstruation, we pay special attention. With this in mind, if the other person says something unreasonable, we don't dwell on it. If I am unhappy and want to lose my temper, I will try my best to think of all the good things about the other person and try to restrain myself. If I really can't restrain myself, I will go to bed earlier, or go to friends and relatives to play, which are all ways to avoid losing my temper. My husband usually pays close attention to my temperament, so when I get angry, he can make me laugh. We both pay attention not to offend what the other person dislikes. For example, he hates others wronging him the most. Regarding this, I pay attention to avoid it. He often praises me, making me embarrassed to do things that displease him; this is also his method.</p>
<p>Regarding household affairs, the responsibilities of both of us are very clear.</p>
<p>Economically, my husband is fully responsible, but I am not wasteful either, and I follow the budget for expenses. There was a time when our family finances were very difficult. He was able to calculate, live within our means, and not be in debt; therefore, many difficult problems were reduced. I must discuss major family matters with my husband, but he does not ask about daily matters at all. If the servants make mistakes, he does not directly blame them, but only tells me. I absolutely do not interfere in his work matters; because I know that if I interfere, it will not help, but will make it more difficult for him to handle things.</p>
<p>We already have children, but I will never neglect my husband because of raising children, so that when he comes home from work, he cannot get the happiness of the family. We also have a certain policy for educating children. When we encounter rewards and punishments, we must agree before proceeding.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the editor, it has been reported to me by the person involved, Wang Renfu, that upon reading the December 7th issue of your newspaper's local news column, in the news about the kidnapping case, the news about the rickshaw puller Wang Ruibao being kidnapped and escaping, was that Wang was redeemed with a large sum of money. I was extremely surprised upon reading it. After investigating, Renfu's son, Ruibao, was kidnapped by bandits on April 27th last year in front of the Siming Guild Hall on Minguo Road. Later, Ruibao escaped from the bandits' den and did not pay money to be redeemed. Now, various newspapers clearly state that he was redeemed with a large sum of money, which does not conform to the facts. Please correct it immediately to clarify the facts, etc. I am writing to request a correction and ask you to publish it as a letter. I remain, sincerely, Shen Bao Guan's editor, lawyer Jin Yu, December 7th.</p>

<p>In the first year of elementary school, the teaching is entirely based on the listening-singing method (emphasis on listening and singing the lyrics; the music score can be listened to more but not sung). The lyrics taught are best performed to increase children's interest.</p>
<p>Second, In the second and third grades of elementary school, the period is a transition from listening and singing to sight-singing, still focusing on sight-singing and performing the lyrics. If children understand the value of musical symbols and need to learn, they can use charts, cards, gestures, and other varied and interesting methods to instruct.</p>
<p>Third, In the fourth year of elementary school, focus on sight-singing teaching. When teaching new lyrics, children can make clear learning of simple music scores. The modes and uses of Chinese and foreign musical instruments, and the ways and uses of ancient and modern ethnic groups' expressions of interest in music can all be started to guide.</p>
<p>Fourth, As far as possible, use the sight-singing method for teaching. If there are songs that can be performed, they must still be performed. The way the music score is organized, the purpose and effectiveness of each method must be understood by the children.</p>
<p>Fifth, Often link teaching with language literature, social studies (such as the musical design of various eras and ethnic groups), work (such as occupational songs of farmers and workers), hygiene, and other designs. In particular, it should be used for the needs of social events, seasonal gatherings, etc. and taught appropriate songs.</p>
<p>Sixth, Music scores should use materials that conform to the national character as much as possible, but mainly use materials that are happy, lively, brave, solemn, and varied. Materials that are sad, negative, and oily or dull and rigid should be avoided.</p>
<p>Seventh, Lyrics should be children's literature, mainly to encourage children's movements, to invigorate personal feelings, and to promote the national spirit. Do not use exhortations or maxims as materials.</p>
<p>Eighth, When teaching new songs, in addition to simple music scores, teachers should often sing and play music as an example so that children can listen. To avoid confusing hearing, it is best not to use musical instrument accompaniment when singing as an example.</p>
<p>Ninth, Children should be made to sing the songs faithfully, and it is strictly forbidden to arbitrarily add embellishments or shout loudly. After each song is practiced, children should be encouraged to sing solos.</p>
<p>Tenth, Within the possible scope, make full use of record players and various local opportunities to listen to music, and teach methods for appreciating music.</p>
<p>Eleventh, Regarding the teaching of appreciation, in addition to specially selected appreciation teaching materials, attention should also be paid to appreciating the songs sung during practice.</p>
<p>Twelfth, Teachers' attitudes should pay attention to neatness and amiability, and their voice skills should pay more attention to beauty and skill. At the beginning of each music teaching, use stories and questions that inspire emotions to arouse children's motivation to learn.</p>
<p>Thirteenth, Teachers should correct children's postures, and pay special attention to them during development.</p>
<p>Fourteenth, When necessary, breathing should be performed as a preparation for singing, and sound should be practiced to ensure accurate singing. When practicing sound, use various changing methods to make children not tired, such as imitating bird calls, insect calls, wind sounds, kite sounds, baby cries, or compiling interesting sentences for children to answer.</p>
<p>Fifteenth, The teaching of lyrics should make children first understand the meaning of the lyrics. The teacher should fully imply the feelings of the lyrics with their attitude (for example, joy is joyful, sorrow is sorrowful, solemnity is solemn, humor is humorous).</p>
<p>Sixteenth, New knowledge of music scores should be constantly compared and studied with old knowledge. For example, the similarities and differences between quarter notes and eighth notes, the differences in the positions of each scale in the G key and C key on the staff... all must be compared to make children understand.</p>
<p>Seventeenth, The practice of songs should be varied in one time, such as singing sometimes, practicing sound sometimes, listening to music sometimes, performing sometimes, shouting section sometimes, dancing section sometimes, clapping section sometimes, standing singing sometimes, sitting sometimes, walking singing sometimes, singing in unison sometimes, singing solo sometimes, singing in groups sometimes... the methods are not the same.</p>
<p>Eighteenth, Attention should be paid to children's range, vocal area, and breathing and vocalization. If there are children with a single tone, their seats should be in the front row or next to the teacher, with special training, and pay attention to them at all times, not letting him hinder the beautiful and pure singing of the whole grade.</p>
<p>Nineteenth, Children should stop singing during the period of voice change, and more practice lessons should be used to replace them in theoretical aspects.</p>
<p>Twentieth, Within the possible scope, encourage children to create and apply songs at any time (such as gatherings, festivals, etc.) (such as using skilled music scores to create lyrics, etc.) to develop children's talent for expressing emotions with music.</p>
<p>Twenty-first, Schools should encourage children to learn various musical instruments and should organize bands, opera performances, music competitions, etc.</p>
<p>Twenty-second, The musical instruments used should be mainly organs or violins. In schools with a lack of funding, the Xiao, flute, and Huqin can be used for teaching.</p>
<p>Twenty-third, The music score should be a staff, and simplified notation should not be used unless absolutely necessary. It is absolutely forbidden to use simplified notation together with staff notation for teaching.</p>
<p>Twenty-fourth, Hearing training should be given special attention. Therefore, the "fixed solfège method" (which is the same-tone singing method commonly used by European and Latin nations) can be adopted for the singing method of the staff, but because of the lack of teachers, the non-fixed solfège method (which is the different-tone singing method commonly used by countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States) can still be adopted. It is also a trend for British and Americans to use same-tone singing.</p>
<p>Twenty-fifth, Within the possible scope, various Chinese and foreign musical instruments should be prepared, and a classroom specially designed for music teaching should be set up.</p>

<p>Sports: Southeast's Victory by One Point Was Hard-Earned</p>
<h3>Liangjiang Controls Meifu and Chongde's Failure Was a Pity</h3>
<p>In last night's Western Girls' Basketball League games, Liangjiang and Southeast successively defeated their opponents, but because the opponents' strengths varied, the situations differed accordingly. The ease with which they won was also different. Liangjiang had a smooth run, reaching the realm of victory directly, while Southeast faced repeated risks, and its victory was not easy to come by. The other three groups were also worth watching, but ultimately not as insightful and interesting as the above two groups.</p>
<p>Liangjiang B Lost Due to Disorganization: The performance of Liangjiang in the first quarter gave us a surprising impression, consistent inside and out, and quite skillful. Zhu Hehong scored twice, occupying a high position, and won the first quarter with a score of four to one. In the second quarter, the Blue Team showed great improvement, and the score gradually approached. At the end, Liangjiang still led by seven to six. At the beginning of the third quarter, the Blue Team rose up boldly. Initially, the Blue Team gained little due to Liangjiang's strong defense, but later Liangjiang's formation became disorganized, and the Blue Team launched a large-scale invasion. As a result, the Blue Team won with nineteen to nine.</p>

<p>Fourth Quarter: Blue Team 5 Points, Liangjiang 0 Points</p>
<p>Liangjiang A Had a Smooth Run: As soon as Liangjiang took the field, they gained the upper hand with their agility and liveliness. Gu Lei missed several good opportunities, but instead allowed the enemy to score first. Suddenly, the formation expanded, and the number of inside and outside strengths greatly increased. The first quarter ended with a score of seven to four. In the second quarter, it was completely Liangjiang's world. Meifu tried hard to fight, but eventually had to give up and return empty-handed. At halftime, Liangjiang had 19 points and Meifu had 4 points. In the third quarter, Meifu's performance was surprisingly good, and they were evenly matched with Liangjiang. In the fourth quarter, Liangjiang scored at will, rising rapidly, while Meifu stared blankly, unsure of how to advance or retreat. As a result, Liangjiang won 35 to 13.</p>

<p>Fourth Quarter: Liangjiang 8 Points, Meifu 2 Points</p>
<p>Chongde Lost After a Valiant Fight: Chongde's skills were quite good, but they were limited by their short stature, which led to their defeat. The first quarter was their fatal blow. The enemy surrounded the basket, throwing one after another. Chongde could only look up. Fortunately, the Yellow Team's shooting was not good, otherwise the score difference would have been even greater. In the first quarter, the Yellow Team scored 7 points, and Chongde scored 4 points. Starting in the second quarter, Chongde changed its strategy, resulting in an equal situation. At halftime, the Yellow Team had 11 points, and Chongde had 8 points. In the second half, Chongde's players had a momentum of overtaking, but they were eventually trapped among the tall enemies, making it difficult to break through. As a result, they lost 14 to 17.</p>

<p>Fourth Quarter: Yellow Team 2 Points, Chongde 3 Points</p>
<p>Southeast Came From Behind: The Green Team was a top-notch team, and Southeast was also a strong opponent. Since the start of the competition, neither had failed. The result of this battle was indeed related to the future championship. At the beginning, they fought each other in a chaotic manner, with no special performances and very close distances. In the first quarter, the Green Team had 3 points, and Southeast had 2 points. In the second quarter, the Green Team gained the upper hand. In the third quarter, Southeast benefited greatly. When the fourth quarter was about to end, the scores were exactly the same, each with 12 points. At that time, people's hearts were fluctuating, and morale was soaring. One ball was decisive, and victory or defeat followed. Heaven blessed Southeast, and a ball flew in during the chaos, hitting the mark. It turned out to be Sun Yuxiu of Southeast. As a result, Southeast won 14 to 12. At halftime, the Green Team led 4 to 8. The only scorer for the Green Team was Po Lingsi, while the top scorer for Southeast was Pan Yueying.</p>

<p>In recent years, Zhejiang Province's sports cause has been promoted by the education authorities, and people from all walks of life have gradually paid attention to various ball games, and are very interested in holding them. However, there are no strong enemies to compete with in the inland, and there is a lack of experience. Except for the volleyball skills of the Art College, which are somewhat remarkable, the combat capabilities of other teams are weak. It is known that Hangzhou Mayor Zhao Zhiyou and Provincial Sports Ground Director Chen Baiqing, in order to seek improvement in ball skills, have contacted the sports circles in Shanghai and invited famous football, basketball, volleyball, and tennis teams and national players from Shanghai to perform in Hangzhou on the 29th of this month. The arrangements have been finalized: The football teams are the once dominant Donghua and Jinan teams. The scheduled competition program is two games: 1) Jinan Team vs. Hangzhou Team; 2) Donghua Team vs. Hangzhou Team. A demonstration match will be held between the Jinan and Donghua teams. The men's basketball teams are Chizhi, the leader of Jiangnan, and Jinan. The women's basketball teams are Liangjiang and Southeast. The volleyball teams are Fudan and Jinan. The tennis players are Chinese national players Qiu Feihai, Lin Baohua, Zheng Zhaojia, and Yu Tianguang. The competition order has not yet been arranged. There will be more than 100 players coming to Hangzhou this time. The estimated cost of the reception is about 1,000 yuan, of which 500 yuan will be borne by the municipal government, and the rest will be raised separately. Zhao Zhiyou, Chen Baiqing, and others have decided to organize a reception committee to preside over everything. In addition, the Shanghai Nanyang Advanced Business School basketball team will come to Hangzhou on the 8th to compete, and the Provincial Sports Ground has been entrusted to arrange opponents. A total of five games will be played: at 3:00 PM on the 9th against the high school team, at 10:00 AM on the 10th against Zhejiang University, at 3:00 PM against Anding, at 10:00 AM on the 11th against the Xuguang team, and at 3:00 PM against No. 1 High School.</p>

<h3>Anhui High School Motorcycle Basketball Team Goes to Provincial Competition, Second Civil Education Center Holds Public Sports Games</h3>
<p>(Wuhu Correspondence) The sports world in Wuhu has been rather depressed in recent years, and various ball game competitions have been suspended for a long time. Now, the Anhui Provincial High School Motorcycle Basketball Team, in order to awaken the attention of the Anhui and Wuhu sports circles to ball games and promote ball skills, came to Wuhu from the province the day before yesterday to compete. The program is: the first day against Wuhu Guan Middle School, the second day against Provincial No. 7 Middle School, the third day against Cuiwen, and the fourth day against Guangyi. The team has always been famous in the province, and this time they came to Wuhu to observe and also have the task of inviting the Wuhu team to the province.</p>
<p>At 2:00 PM on the 3rd of this month, they first competed against Wuhu Guan Middle School at the Public Sports Ground. The notary was Chen Zhuxian. Although the weather was not good, with drizzling rain, the players of both sides were still full of energy. After 40 minutes of fierce battle, unfortunately, Motorcycle lost miserably with a score of 12 to Wuhu Middle School's 42 points.</p>

<h3>Sanlin Vocational School vs. Zhoupu County Middle School, Sanlin Wins with a Score of Two to Zero</h3>
<p>The day before yesterday afternoon, the Sanlin Vocational School football team from Sanlin Tang came to Pu to have a friendly match with the County Middle School team. The impartial person was Shen Yunzhang. On that day, the weather was heavy rain, but both sides did not delay the moment because of this, and the competition was very fierce. In less than ten minutes, Chen Daoxun of the Erlin Vocational School kicked in a goal. Afterwards, the rain became heavier, and the clothes and shoes were all wet. Both sides dragged mud and water and carried out water battles, falling and rolling, which was very interesting. The ball was often in front of the County Middle School's goal, in a precarious situation. After changing venues in the second half, the rain eased slightly, and the competition became more intense. The County Middle School continued to work hard to counterattack, but the internal and external connections of the Vocational School had no opportunity to take advantage of. As the battle was about to end, Zhu Jingyu of the Vocational School kicked in another goal. As a result, Sanlin Vocational School won with a score of two to zero. The lineup of Sanlin Vocational School is as follows: Xiao Yuyi, Kang Wenbin, Zhao Ruitou, Zhu Yisun, Ding Genquan, Ni Shangde, Wang Zhuanglin, Chen Daoxun, Wang Zhiwen, Zhu Jingcheng, Li Bingtiao. Substitutes: Ren Guangen, Hu Huixiang.</p>
<h3>Puzhong Football Team Wins Against Guanghua</h3>
<p>The Puzhong vs. Guanghua match in the football competition of the Central Sports Federation's Hai [Sea] Group was held at the Guanghua Stadium. The competition was related to the right to the finals of the group, so the Puzhong students organized a cheering squad to go and cheer to boost the momentum. During the competition, the sounds of cheering were heard everywhere, which was very lively. As a result, Pudong won with a score of three to zero. Unfortunately, when the Puzhong players returned to school and passed in front of the Guanghua school gate, they were stopped by some students from the school. They were able to leave the school safely only after the protection of Director Liao and the physical education teacher of the school.</p>

<p>Short Story</p>
<h3>The Capture of Square Fort (1)</h3>
<p>— French American Star Film Translation</p>
<p>A soldier, who died of heatstroke in Greece a few years ago, once told me about his first combat experience. I was deeply moved by the story, so I later took the time to write it down from memory. Here is the story:</p>
<p>× × × ×</p>
<p>I returned to my unit on the afternoon of September 4th. I met the regimental commander in the camp. He was initially quite rude to me, but after reading General B's letter of recommendation, his expression changed, and he exchanged a few polite words with me.</p>
<p>He introduced me to the squadron commander, who had just returned from an inspection. This squadron commander, whom I later had no time to get to know, was a tall, chestnut-haired man with a stern and unpleasant face. He had previously been a private, and he had earned his epaulettes and cross on the battlefield. His voice was hoarse and low, not at all in proportion to his huge body. I was told that his strange voice was a gift from a bullet that had pierced him during the Battle of Eylau.</p>
<p>When he heard that I was from the Fontainebleau Artillery School, he made an ugly face and said:</p>
<p>丨My lieutenant died yesterday...</p>
<p>I knew he meant to say, "You are the one to fill his vacancy, but you are not worthy of the job." I wanted to retort with a sharp remark, but I held back.</p>
<p>The moon rose from behind the Square Fort of Sevastopol, which was separated from our camp by two cannon shots. It was large and red, just as it usually rose. But that night, it seemed particularly large to me. For a moment, the square fort stood out as a distinct black silhouette against a backdrop of brilliant moonlight. It looked like the cone of an erupting volcano. An old soldier next to me noticed the color of the moon.</p>
<p>丨The moon is very red, he said; this means that this famous square fort will require many sacrifices to capture!</p>
<p>I have always been very superstitious, especially at this time, and this omen could not help but move me. I went to sleep, but I couldn't fall asleep. I got up and walked around for a while, looking at the vast front line that enveloped the hills opposite the village of Sevastopol.</p>
<p>When I felt that the cool evening air was enough to calm my blood, I returned to the fire; I carefully wrapped myself in my cloak, closed my eyes, and hoped not to open them again until dawn. But sleep never came. My thoughts unconsciously sank into a state of sorrow. I thought to myself that among the hundred thousand people who filled the plains, I did not have a single friend, and if I were injured, I would sleep in a hospital, neglected by some ignorant surgeons. Many stories I had heard about surgery surged into my memory. My heart beat violently, and I mechanically adjusted the handkerchief and pouch hanging on my chest like a kind of armor. I was too tired to bear it, and I dozed off from time to time, but I was always awakened by a powerful, ominous thought. But fatigue finally prevailed, and when the morning drums began to beat, I fell fast asleep. We lined up, took roll call, and then we stacked our guns in bundles, all of which foreshadowed a quiet day for us.</p>
<p>At three o'clock, an adjutant arrived with an order. We were again ordered to take up arms; our skirmishers spread out across the plain, and we slowly advanced behind them. Twenty minutes later, we saw all of the Russian soldiers' outposts retreating back into the square fort.</p>
<h3>On Dwelling</h3>
<p>— Man</p>
<p>The universe is originally a large house. People come with cries and leave with smiles, all like passing guests in a dream. Precisely because they are passers-by, they must enjoy this moment of time to the fullest before taking their last breath. Even if they do not plan for future generations, from one generation to the next to ten thousand generations, they should at least have a piece of land where they can stand firmly. This is where the issue of "dwelling" arises.</p>
<p>As most people think, the heavens and the earth are so vast that anywhere can be a home. Moreover, from cave dwelling to the present day, red walls and green tiles have almost covered the five continents and ten thousand countries. Even if grandchildren are born from children, and the population grows day by day, who would believe that they cannot find a place to live?</p>
<p>However, things are not so simple. Look at those who live in dilapidated walls, exposed to wind and sun, those who stand like doves and cranes, relying on others for shelter, those who take refuge in open spaces, using the sky as a brocade and the earth as a carpet, exposed to wind and rain, they are all before our eyes, numbering far more than just thousands and thousands. As the saying goes, "Having no land to stand on when alive and no place to be buried when dead," can this heaven and earth truly be considered "vast"?</p>
<p>But on the other hand, there are also the palaces of Afang with a building every five steps and a pavilion every ten steps, with rows of brocade curtains stretching forty miles long. Take, for example, the Forbidden City in Beijing, with its winding corridors and numerous palaces and halls. There are also rooms with carpets, marble floors, small gardens, large kitchens, plus a few mansions and villas, all just for "dwelling." Comparing the group who "have no land to stand on when alive" with the group who live in the palaces of Afang, although we do not want to emulate Liu Bang and sigh, "Should a true man not be like this?" but this vast house of the universe belongs to everyone. Since everyone is like a passing guest in a dream, then to forcibly call a portion of people homeless, while another portion "gets what they want, gets what they want," then at least a flaw has occurred in this world! Alas, "When can we get a great mansion of ten thousand rooms, to shelter all the poor scholars of the world and make them smile with joy!"</p>

<h3>To the Children</h3>
<p>— Biyun</p>
<p>My dear Inge, my little darling:</p>
<p>Naturally, it was out of boredom that I took out all the letters from friends from the drawer and flipped through them page by page. Behind your mother's letter, I found a few words of your greetings, and I immediately thought of writing you a letter. Although my handwriting is scribbled and there are many things I say that you do not understand, your mother will read it to you and explain it to you better than I can write. Little darling, as long as you understand one-third of what I say, I will be satisfied, and the mission of this letter will be accomplished. Dear child, take a good look at this letter.</p>
<p>Today is a rainy day. It is said that Japan is always like this, with very few sunny days. At first, I did not believe it, but after living here for twenty days, it really proved that what they said was true. In these twenty days, I have only seen the sun twice and the moon once, but in less than three hours, it became cloudy again. The sky is filled with gloomy and miserable clouds, symbolizing the future of Japanese imperialism with a deathly stillness.</p>
<p>People living in this kind of climate are most prone to complaining, especially someone like me who grew up in the intensely sunny South. Living this kind of life is really painful. I am sad, my heart is just itchy, and it feels like something wants to jump out of my eyes, but a minute passes, and that thing still hasn't come out. I know it is being suppressed by reason, because if it came out, this letter might not be written.</p>
<p>Today is the Double Tenth Festival, and your school must be closed. You may be sitting next to your mother reading, playing with a toy gun, or staring blankly at the sky. If Shanghai is raining like it is here, then you must be even more unhappy, because you can't go out to play, and your mother wants to write more things on a rainy day. She not only won't take you to play or tell you stories, but she will also forbid you from speaking, forbid you from singing, and even interfere with your slightest movement. Alas, poor child, I am worried about you. If Shanghai is raining today like it is here, then how will you get through it? Are you as bored as I am?</p>
<p>I don't know why, but there are very few times when I forget about children. This is not because I have a child of my own, but because I have always liked children. Because I feel that only children are innocent, pure, and loyal. They have no hypocrisy, no pride, and no base or cruel behavior. They have no class consciousness. If the children of wealthy families are not good, it is because their families have taught them badly. The "Three Character Classic" says, "At the beginning of man, his nature is good," and that is indeed true!</p>
<p>Inge, you are indeed too pitiful! The children in the same alley as you are all happier than you. They have toy cars, dolls, beautiful clothes and hats, and in winter, they have coats and velvet hats, and they take chauffeured cars to school, with nannies picking them up and dropping them off... But you can't even get enough to eat sometimes. Occasionally, you steal two copper coins from your mother to buy candy, and you get a beating when you come back. Do you remember? Dear little darling! That was three days before I left the country. Your mother came to invite me and another friend to dinner. I knew she couldn't afford to treat, so we bought four eggs to bring with us, but later, those eggs were never cooked. It turned out that there was already a bowl of dried tofu stir-fried with diced meat, cabbage, and shrimp and radish soup on the table. "Is there enough food?" Your mother asked us with a shy smile.</p>
<p>"Enough, enough, of course, enough!" This was our reply to her.</p>
<p>Even now, I still want to ask you, little darling, when exactly were those four eggs cooked and eaten? How many did you eat? Did your mother beat you?</p>
<p>Alas! Speaking of beating, I really feel sorry for you! It was that time when we were eating at your house that your mother, because you were eating too much food, hurriedly used chopsticks to hit your soft, plump, bun-like little hand a few times. We were very upset for you and blamed her for being so violent. She replied to us very seriously: "You don't know, he only eats vegetables every day. When he eats too much salt, he drinks water like crazy. This is not only harmful to his health, but it also makes him buy boiling water many times a day!"</p>
<p>Alas! Little darling, do you know? It is not easy for your mother to even get the money to buy boiling water! She is constantly holding a pen and writing, sometimes sighing, sometimes crying, and sometimes laughing and crying like a madwoman. Little darling, this is all because the oppression of life has led to such mental pain and such abnormality!</p>
<p>This letter stops here. After I receive your reply, I will say other things.</p>
<p>I wish you and your little friends who share the same fate to be lively and happy!</p>
<h3>Life Exhausted, Pulse Severed</h3>
<p>— Zifang</p>
<p>"Education is the lifeblood of the nation," this "new" cliché seems to have been heard by us for a long time; a very long time. However, what we see with our own eyes is either the education funds of a certain province or a certain province's primary schools have not been distributed for several months, or the teachers and staff of a certain middle school are making trouble in the hall, demanding arrears, or a certain university has formally suspended operations due to a lack of funds.</p>
<p>Under this educational crisis in which arrears of salaries and a lack of food have become widespread, students have become wandering elements with nowhere to go, and nineteen out of ten teachers and staff have become poor victims suffering from a lack of clothing and food. If "education is the lifeblood of the nation" is a true statement, then our old and sick country has indeed reached a stage where its life is exhausted and its pulse is severed!</p>
<p>Science</p>
<h3>Television</h3>
<p>— He</p>
<p>Television is a scientific invention that broadcasts sound and images simultaneously using the principles of radio. Its English name is Television, and the Japanese translation is テレビ (terebi).</p>
<p>The speech and music broadcast from a distant broadcasting station are transmitted through radio waves and amplified by the receiver's amplifier, allowing you to hear the same speech or music as the broadcasting station. This is radio broadcasting. Because this can only hear sound, it is "radio for the ears."</p>
<p>Then, what I want to talk about here is radio broadcasting of images, which is the so-called "radio for the eyes." For example, if the broadcasting station is performing the Peking opera "Si Lang Visits His Mother," after the radio waves are transmitted, the Television receivers in all directions will show people the movements of the actors and listen to the singing, just like opening a sound movie.</p>
<p>Due to space limitations, the structure of television transmitters and receivers cannot be explained in detail. The principle is summarized as follows.</p>
<p>For example, when Mei Lanfang is singing "Su San Starts Her Journey" at the broadcasting station, his posture becomes a small photograph through a spherical lens. However, after passing through the Nipkow disk, the image is projected onto a photocell. The photocell converts light into electricity, which is then sent to the transmitter and becomes radio waves. Finally, it is broadcast by the antenna. That's the broadcasting aspect.</p>
<p>Next, I will explain the receiver. The radio waves received by the antenna are introduced into the amplifier of the television receiver, and then introduced into a device that changes the degree of brightness by passing electricity through light. Then, due to the strong light, different intensities of light are displayed actively on the white cloth, and Mei Lanfang's posture in the distance is faintly smiling before our eyes. As for the transmission and reception of sound, it is the broadcasting and receiving of sound by radio: converting sound into radio waves, emitting it from the antenna, and then receiving the radio waves from the antenna, repeating the process of converting it back into sound and amplifying it for transmission.</p>
<p>Because the sound and image are transmitted simultaneously on that side, and the sound and image are received simultaneously on this side, it is like watching a sound movie at home.</p>
<p>Regarding this science, countries are still competing to continue research, and it can be said that it is still in the experimental stage. Undoubtedly, the application of Television is extremely broad. Russia has been working hard to implement it in recent years, making its devices common in rural areas, and it has become a powerful tool for public education.</p>
<p>Long Novel</p>
<h3>The Crossroads of Time and Love 8</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>As she was about to go downstairs, she turned her head to look at Jinhua and said with a smile. "...Rest assured, right?"</p>
<p>"Not at ease."</p>
<p>"Well, then I won't go down. I'll wait for you to go down together."</p>
<p>She deliberately stopped her footsteps.</p>
<p>"She's having some kind of free love affair with your sister. She must be a modern youth. You have to be careful. Be careful when you speak, don't let him laugh at you."</p>
<p>"What free love, I'm tired of hearing these words. None of the marriages based on free love have good results. Our marriage is still happy, the order of parents, the words of a matchmaker. We didn't know each other before, so what's wrong with that?"</p>
<p>"But, our marriage is barbaric. From the perspective of those modern youths, locking up men and women who don't know each other in a room... is a sin...."</p>
<p>"Don't talk nonsense again!"</p>
<p>"So we are all guilty of sin."</p>
<p>"I won't listen, I won't listen."</p>
<p>"The attitude of Peizhen on the first night... Ha, ha, ha!"</p>
<p>Peizhen stretched out her hands to cover her ears and went downstairs. Jinhua didn't stop laughing until she couldn't see her. He heard his wife whistling as she went down the escalator step by step. She was singing something like a dance tune.</p>
<p>Haiquan saw the sister of his lover, and what shocked him was that Peizhen's facial features and the configuration of her eyebrows, eyes, nose, and mouth were more beautiful than her sister's. Following this shock, his whole body also felt a slight tremor, and his voice trembled unexpectedly when he answered her. He gradually saw the differences between the sisters. The older sister's figure was more sensual, while the younger sister's figure was too thin. The older sister's face was rounder, while the younger sister's face was a bit pointed. The older sister's expression was cheerful, while the younger sister's expression was melancholy. The older sister's attitude was emotional, while the younger sister's attitude was rational.</p>
<p>He felt that Peizhen was not as arrogant as the rumors said. She asked him many questions about Guangdong. Finally, she also told him to come and play often, just like with his own family.</p>
<p>After a moment, that Master Ren also came down to greet him. Haiquan only felt that he was a complete American returnee. When he spoke, he inserted a few English words from time to time. Haiquan heard the word "Sure" countless times. His hands were in his trouser pockets, and he shrugged his shoulders every time he said a joke.</p>
<p>"Why do people outside say that they are arrogant? Aren't they very kind and approachable people?"</p>
<p>Haiquan thought again that maybe it was only like this to him. Because he had family ties with them.</p>
<p>Haiquan originally wanted to say goodbye after sitting for a while. But after seeing this Master Ren's wife, he didn't want to leave. After talking with her for a while, he felt even more that she had a charm that made people want to stay.</p>
<p>He finally had lunch at their house. It was already after three o'clock when he said goodbye to the Ren family. Master Ren even specially called a car to send him back to Professor Zeng's house in Beiqiaobei.</p>

<h3>The Gold Market in Financial Turmoil</h3>
<p>(Finally Fell Another One or Two Taels) Yesterday's market continued to decline slightly, although there was a state of drifting, there was no major storm. The difference between the high and low points of the overall market was less than six taels, and finally it fell another one or two taels. The market opened weakly, presumably due to the rise in the silver market, the rise in forward prices, and the continued rise in exchange rates. In the future, due to the overt and covert flattening of bills of exchange, there will be both good and bad quality at times, and due to the different disbursements of various parties, the price of gold often fluctuates by two or three taels. However, it always hovers within 800 taels, and people's minds are inevitably confused. Since the market is closed on Wednesday, the detailed situation of the half-day will be recorded later.</p>
<p>(Hovering within the 800 Taels Mark) From the opening of the market in January at 795 taels and a half, it immediately fell by one tael and three mace. The private telegraph silver price also rose by sixteen and three-eighths of a cent. Then it fell to 4 taels and 8 mace. Shortly afterwards, Dadaicheng, Yifengyong, and Wupin and others came in, and the US dollar against one, two, and three months was only settled at 31.25. China-Belgium absorbed British gold at 25 for April, so the gold price rose by four taels. At 9:30, it was 98 taels and 8 mace. HSBC's listing announced that British gold rose by 1.25 and US dollars rose by 1.875, but the gold price was unmoved, only losing three or four mace. There were still many buyers. Hengxing, Chunyuan, Yongyifengyong, Yufutaiheng, etc., dragged in, which was 99 taels. Immediately afterwards, the US Merchant Bank made a US dollar deal for 25 for January, China-Belgium released British gold at 1.25 for February, and Daxingyong, Fuchang, Dadaicheng, etc. sold. At 10:00, it was 5 taels and 5 mace. Hengxing Bingxing bought another six or seven hundred bars, and Yuanxing Yongyuan Maoyong Yuantai and others followed suit without benefit, so the gold price suddenly increased by three taels to 8 taels and a half. Later, HSBC released British gold at 1.25 for January, China-Belgium released US dollars at 1.875, and Hengyu, Zhaofengchang, Hengxing Yuanchun Qianchangxiang and others sold, gradually falling by three taels. At around 11:00, it was 4 taels and 8 mace. Instantly, one or two mace was added again, and scattered users dragged in. Afterwards, the Silver Company released US dollars at 56.25 for April, China-Belgium released US dollars at 25 for January, and Yuanyangyong, Dadaicheng, Yifengyong Hongkangyong and others' intentions to sell were strong, and in just over ten minutes, it depreciated by three taels. At 11:30, it was 93 taels and 2 mace. Suddenly, news came that the United States was planning to increase import taxes, and people's hearts were slightly strengthened. Hengxing continued to buy four or five hundred bars, and Xiexing Yongyifengyong and others also followed suit. Maijia Li entered US dollars at 28.5 yuan for March. At 11:50, it was 96 taels. Afterwards, it was flat, but Dadaicheng sold more. Near the close of the market, it was 95 taels. Yuanyangyong came in and slightly pulled up seven or eight mace, and then closed at 95 taels and 8 mace, falling by one tael compared to the previous day. It had been falling for five consecutive days. According to the half-day, the highest was 99 taels and the lowest was 93 taels and 2 mace, a difference of 5 taels and 8 mace. The bare bar was calculated to add 11 taels and a half.</p>
<p>(Posted Price Reduced by Five Taels) The posted price was based on the US dollar rising by 1.875, and was changed to 863 taels, a total of 64 taels and 5 mace to 70 taels. The noon closing was 67 taels, which was 5 taels less than the day before. Registered at 98 taels to 97 taels, replenishment at 97 taels.</p>
<p>(Lack of Large Transactions) Although there were no large purchases on the table, there seemed to be more buyers, but people's hearts were not good, so the market was difficult to stimulate. According to statistics, Yuanyangyong, Yifengyong, Senchangyong, Yuanxingyong, Bingxing, etc. all entered Dadaicheng. Fuchang, Hengchangyong, and Shunli all exited. Hengyu and Fuyu were very busy entering and exiting. Futaiheng, Yuantai, Yuankangxiang, Yuanchun, Daxingyong, Changshengyong, etc., had occasional entries and exits. Dalian brought in a total of about 200 bars and also exited more than 200 bars. Guangbang (Hengxing) entered a total of 1,600 to 700 bars, it is said.</p>
<h3>Exchange Rate Listed Long</h3>
<p>丨The Internal Market is Similar to the Previous Market丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silver market continued to rise, and the exchange rate between British and American currencies did not move. The exchange rate between US and British currencies rose again by 0.9375, and HSBC's listing in the Shanghai market was lengthened by half a grade, with British gold rising by 1.25 and US dollars rising by 1.875. Hong Kong fell back by 0.25, and the rest all trended upwards. It is likely that the internal market of the bank has a slight swing, and the result of the consolidation is flattened, which is no different from the closing price of the day before. Because it is Wednesday, the banks only have half a day of trading in the morning, so it is not very lively. It is estimated that there were about 100,000 pounds of British gold, and the gold industry slightly released it to Sassoon Foreign Company. The transaction of US dollars amounted to 400,000 to 500,000 yuan, and each firm slightly scraped, and there were occasional sales. The American Silver Company sold forward contracts.</p>
<p>(British Exchange) The internal market in the first half of the day had 0.0625 up and down. The early opening selling price for December and January was one shilling and nine pence 0.125, February 0.1875, March 0.25, and the buying price was 0.1875 to 0.3225. China-Belgium ate 0.25 for April and released 0.125 for February and ate 0.25 for January (Sassoon released). HSBC released 0.125 for January, China released 0.0625 for December, and the noon closing was the same as the early opening.</p>
<p>(American Exchange) The internal market in the morning had a review of 0.1875. From the morning opening selling price of 28.1875 yuan for December, 25 for January, 0.375 for February, and half a yuan for March, the buying price was 31.25 to 62.5. Holland and China-Belgium mutually traded at 8.125 yuan for December, Pan Gen released 0.125 for December, Anda and China-Belgium mutually traded at 0.375 for March, Maijia Li released 31.25 for March, Yuntong sold 0.25 for January to Citibank, and China-Belgium released 0.1875 for January and ate 56.25 for April (American Silver Company released). Anda and China-Belgium mutually traded at 0.1875 for December, China-Belgium released 0.25 for January, and Maijia Li ate half a yuan for March. The noon closing selling price was 28.125 to 43.75 yuan, and the buying price was 25 to 56.25. One US dollar is equivalent to 3 taels, 5 mace, 9 fen, and 3 li and 6 hao of silver, it is said.</p>
<h3>Large Strips Lengthen 0.0625</h3>
<p>National News Agency, London, 7th. Large strips have lengthened 0.0625 for both near and far terms, calculated as 17 pence 0.75 for near terms and 17 pence 0.8125 for far terms. The British-American exchange rate opened at 3 yuan, 2 jiao, and 3 fen.</p>
<h3>New Prices Suddenly Appear for Foreign Interest</h3>
<p>丨Exceeding the 4% Threshold丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign exchange transactions were firm due to another large export volume in the afternoon. Silver taels, however, remained in a weak state. As for settlement news, banks remained relatively strong, while money shops, with the end of the year approaching and the time for settlements drawing near, mostly reduced their activity.</p>
<p>(Interest Rises, Discount Softens) The morning market for "foreign interest" was at 7 mace, 1 fen, 3 li, 7 hao, 5 si, the same as the previous day's afternoon market. The afternoon market suddenly rose by another 3 hao, 7 hu, 5 si, exceeding the 4% threshold, with 7 mace, 1 fen, 4 li, 1 hao, 2 hu, 5 si, reappearing at the new high price of the first half of the year. The "silver discount" was the same in both the morning and afternoon markets, at 3% plus water, with no market and uniformly white.</p>
<p>(Copper Coins Continue to Shrink) Jiangnan small foreign coins were at 6 mace, 2 fen, 5 li in the morning market and 6 mace, 2 fen, 8 li in the afternoon market. The transaction volume was 6,000 jiao in the morning market and 9,500 jiao in the afternoon market. Guangdong small foreign coins were at 6 mace, 2 fen, 3 li, 5 hao in the morning market, with the same price in the afternoon market. The transaction volume was 110,000 jiao in the morning market and 30,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins shrank by another 1,000 wen, to 392,000 wen, with a weak transaction volume of 42,000 strings of wen.</p>

<h3>The Securities Market is Even More Dull</h3>
<p>丨Slightly Better by About Three or Four Cents丨</p>
<p>Yesterday's market conditions at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange were flat in the futures market. Transactions between the two sessions were only over 1.8 million. The market was slightly stronger in the afternoon, and trading was slightly more active, with transactions of about 2.8 million, totaling 4,644,500 yuan. The spot market was as deserted as before, with only 14,000 yuan transacted for the entire day. The overall situation felt even more dull, with only a few cents of fluctuation between the various sessions. However, in the afternoon, the market showed a slight increase in demand and a tendency to firm up, resulting in an improvement of about three or four cents compared to the previous day.</p>

<h3>The New York Stock Market is Surging</h3>
<p>A report from the Eastern American Bank states that the New York stock market has been strong since Monday. The situation improved further on Tuesday, with strong buying interest from all sides. The market actively trended upward, with significant gains in industrial, railway, and utility stocks. According to official reports, the surge in the stock market on Tuesday was due to President Hoover's speech in Congress, in which he stated that the government would maintain budget equilibrium through sales tax collection and spending reduction policies, which greatly reassured the public. The commodity market was not entirely good. Wheat fell back to 43.75 cents (per bushel), but the cotton market was affected by Wall Street, and closed up to $5.80 per hundred pounds. According to railway industry reports, operating income for the past three months has been excellent, and the total earnings of the business sector in the fourth quarter of this year are expected to be higher than in the same period last year. The Dow Jones Index is attached below:</p>
<p>December 5th    December 6th    Shanghai</p>
<p>Industry    56.53    59.58    Up 3.05</p>
<p>Railway    24.59    26.81    Up 2.22</p>

<p>Shanghai Commercial Securities Index Attached</p>
<p>December 6th    20.78    December 7th    20.86    Up 0.08</p>
<p>A report from Sin Fung Foreign Firm (6th) also stated that the New York stock market's upward trend intensified. The market opened strong early in the morning. President Hoover's proposal to introduce a sales tax and balance the budget through austerity measures in his speech to Congress, without mentioning agricultural relief or the beer issue, led speculators to increase their bets, and stocks soared. Trading was also slightly more active, with a total of 1.1 million shares traded throughout the day. Furthermore, the total net income of the national railways in October was the highest this year. Dow Jones financial news agencies predict that steel production this week will be 17%, better than the 1% increase last week.</p>
<h3>The Yarn, Flower, and Yarn Markets are Calm</h3>
<p>It is Still Difficult for Yarn Factories to Stop Night Work</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market has returned to a calm state, but the situation shows a slight firmness. The proposed reduction in working hours by yarn factories has made people uncertain and most are taking a wait-and-see attitude. As a result, the market has stabilized and customer sales are slightly more active. However, fellow traders purchased 460 bales of 20-count Three Rams yarn because of its cheap price, not because of actual business. Based on the current environment, inventories are too thick, and a large increase is feared to be difficult.</p>
<p>(Auction Yarn in Wait-and-See Mode) The opening price of auction yarn this morning was slightly higher due to the slight increase in American cotton, with each month rising by two or three cents. However, after two or three rounds of bidding, those holding the goods took profits, and the market fell again, with each month falling by three cents. In the afternoon, it was heard that the sales of spot yarn were still good, and people's confidence was slightly boosted. As for the issue of yarn factories stopping night work, it is still difficult to become a reality at present, so the market remains flat, with each month rising by one to four cents. The total transaction volume for the day was 16,400 bales. It was found that Taichang sold 1,100 bales, Xincheng 450 bales, Shenji 350 bales, and Suilong 300 bales. Tongxing bought 1,100 bales, Mingde 850 bales, Jifeng 550 bales, Dafu 450 bales, Changfeng 600 bales, and Gengfeng 550 bales. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>(Yarn Sales are Gradually Expanding) Spot yarn sales are gradually becoming more active. It was found that the total purchase volume of each gang throughout the day was 1,374 bales. The market price was similar to the previous day. The purchase amount of each gang is listed below:</p>
<p>Northern Gang 100 Yunnan 100 Ningbo 15 Inland 39 Jiangxi 30</p>

<h3>Methods for Ordering Foreign Wheat (Continued) · Zhi · De</h3>
<p>(Increase or Decrease in Price) The increase or decrease in the price of foreign or local wheat at the time of exchange delivery is due to differences in quality. Those exceeding the standard wheat are appropriately increased (upgraded), and those below the standard are appropriately reduced (downgraded). The details are described below:</p>
<p>Canadian Wheat: No. 2 wheat with 153 catties is qualified, and the standard is increased by 2 mace and 5 fen. No. 3 wheat with 151 catties is qualified and increased by 2 mace. No. 4 wheat with 149 catties is qualified and increased by 1 mace. Canadian wheat has an average quality. At the time of exchange delivery, it only needs to be based on the original grade to enjoy the standard upgrade.</p>
<p>Australian Wheat: Divided into two types, Western wheat, with a particularly heavy body, can be upgraded by 2 mace and 9 fen according to the standard at the highest. Southern wheat has an average quality, and is upgraded according to the standard by 7 fen to 1 mace. However, the exchange's regulations stipulate that foreign wheat delivered is standardized at 146 catties per Sima scale. The standard is increased by 2 mace and 5 fen, and then increased by 2 fen for each additional catty, increasing sequentially. It will no longer increase beyond 148 catties. 145 catties are increased by 2 mace and 3 fen, 144 catties are increased by 2 mace and 1 fen, 143 catties are increased by 1 mace and 8 fen, 142 catties are increased by 1 mace and 5 fen, 141 catties are increased by 1 mace and 2 fen, 140 catties are increased by 7 fen, and will no longer increase below that.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat: Its delivery situation is roughly equivalent to Canadian red wheat. Those with 150 catties are increased by 2 mace and 3 fen. Those below 148 catties are unqualified for general orders. Most of them are based on No. 2 wheat.</p>
<p>Domestic Wheat: At the time of exchange delivery, 139 catties to 140 catties per stone (Hai hu) is qualified. Usually, one car (ie, 500 dan) is the unit. Actual delivery can also be changed. The minimum amount is 485 dan, and the maximum amount is 515 dan. If the amount exceeds the specified amount, the excess or shortage shall be calculated at a 95% discount based on the delivery price to indicate the restriction. Usually, the Jinghu car with 30 tons is the standard, because it is suitable for 500 dan. Although the buns in various places are different in size, they are all based on weight. However, the level of delivery is more complicated than foreign wheat.</p>
<p>⑴ Upgrade: 141 catties are increased by 2 fen, 142 catties are increased by 4 fen, and 143 catties are increased by 6 fen at most, and no more will be increased.</p>
<p>⑵ Downgrade: 138 catties are reduced by 2 fen, 137 catties are reduced by 5 fen, 136 catties are reduced by 9 fen, 135 catties are reduced by 1 mace and 3 fen, 134 catties are reduced by 1 mace and 8 fen, 133 catties are reduced by 2 mace and 5 fen, and it will fail and cannot be delivered again. If there are impurities or mud ash in it, 3% is the standard. If there is more or less when sieving, it will be increased or removed accordingly.</p>
<p>Looking at the above grading of this wheat and foreign wheat, there are two kinds of perceptions. First, the highest grade of foreign wheat has reached 2 mace and 9 fen, and the lowest is also about 1 mace. The standard for delivery is 146 catties as qualified at the lowest, and the highest is 148 catties or more. The highest upgrade for this wheat is 6 fen, as if it is already a rare bird. The standard for delivery is 139 catties to 140 catties, and the lowest is 133 catties, which is reduced by 2 mace and 5 fen. Comparing the highest foreign wheat with the lowest standard for this wheat, the difference is as high as 5 mace and 4 fen. The quality of agricultural products is obviously different. Improving planting and improving quality should not be delayed. Moreover, inferior products cannot maintain their original production due to various reasons, so flour mills are only competing to order foreign wheat. It is pitiful and painful. It is urgent to rescue, and the national people have a responsibility for it. (End)</p>
<h3>Stable Cotton Market</h3>
<p>Manufacturers Occasionally Move in When This Month's Supply is Thrown</p>
<p>The cotton market is still strong, and the situation is stable and quiet. According to the rise in American cotton, spot cotton on the market is scarce. Since a certain factory has thrown out a large batch, it is estimated that there are more than 50,000 in December (ie, the current period). Currently, the source of supply from various sources is very rare and only low prices are occasionally moved in, which makes the market increasingly tight. However, the long-term is not moving but flat. According to a communication from Jinan, there are currently 80,000 to 90,000 bales of cotton in Shandong (wheat price is 41 to 2 yuan per dan). A certain Japanese cotton firm in the area went bankrupt, affecting the market price and causing a sudden drop.</p>
<p>(Each Month's Zheng Standard is Good for Five Cents) The Zheng Standard market opened this morning. Initially, the market rose with the rise in American cotton. After two or three rounds, the market fell again because the yarn market was weak. As a result, it rose by five cents. In the afternoon, the market still had Xincheng shorting, with each month rising by five cents to one mace. The total transaction volume for the day was 24,400 dan. It was found that Changfeng sold 1,000 dan, Geng 800 dan, Tongxing 700 dan, and Ji 600 dan. Mingde bought 1,100 dan, Xincheng 1,000 dan, Suilong 600 dan, and Xinheng 700 dan. The closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Zheng Standard    Closing Up/Down    Inventory    33175 Up 5.95    900</p>
<p>December 3150 Up 5    13690043180    569400</p>

<p>February 3170    5    122800    Total    683600</p>
<p>(High-Price Raw Cotton Factory Handling is Very Lax) The factory's need for spot cotton has become dull again. Because the yarn market is sluggish, there is very little intention to handle high-priced raw materials. The source is estimated to be 514 bales of Yaohua and 1,200 bales of Tonghua.</p>
<p>Shaanxi 30.75 Shanghai Factory enters 400 pieces Spot Delivered to Factory</p>
<p>Luoyang 35.0 Shanghai Factory enters 160 pieces Spot Delivered to Factory</p>
<p>Yancheng 29.00 Chongxin Factory enters 500 bales Spot Delivered to Factory</p>
<h3>American and British Cotton Both Rebounded</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton rebounded due to good news from Liverpool, purchases by peers, and strong support from Wall Street. Futures rose by 11 to 15 points, and spot rose by 10 points. British cotton futures rose by 4 to 5 points, and spot rose by 3 points. Egyptian cotton spot rose by 12 points. Indian cotton was initially strong due to purchases by Japanese merchants, but later weakened due to profit-taking. Ola fell by 2.5 rupees, and Bai Luo Creek fell by 3 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (6th telegram):</p>

<h3>American Cotton Private Estimates</h3>
<p>New York Telegram on the 6th, Foxx Crook Bureau's cotton estimate for this year is</p>
<p>12,316,000 bales, an increase of 1,141,000 bales compared to the previous estimate. The amount of ginned cotton is 11,225,000 bales. Also, the Mypher Dun Company's estimate of new cotton production for this year is 12,018,000 bales, an increase of 619,000 bales compared to the previous estimate. The amount of ginned cotton is 11,036,000 bales.</p>
<h3>The Grain and Flour Market After the Auction Entered a Strong Phase</h3>
<p>丨More Absorptions by Futers to Deliberately Raise Prices丨</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, in the morning, the market for each month showed a sign of initial decline and then stability. Foreign wheat quotations fell slightly by one or two jiao. Therefore, at the beginning, people's hearts were weak, and the near and far periods made a slight advance compared to the previous day. Later, each round, because the short covering was very urgent, the customer gang also had a slight transaction. The manufacturer's spot goods are still less than the accumulated soldiers, and they are still shouting one or two yuan and nine qian. Fufeng's goods are still for settlement in the previous month, so people's hearts seem to be gradually improving. When the market opened in the afternoon, each month stepped on the firmness because the futures absorbed and deliberately raised the price. The factory only slightly released Fufeng, and the rest did not move. In the future observation, we must have abundant spot goods before we can truly loosen. As a result, this month was better than the previous day by five li, January was better by one fen and two and a half li, February was better by seven and a half li, March and April were better by five li, and May was better by seven and a half li.</p>
<h3>The Trend of Wheat Futures is Generally Weak</h3>
<p>丨Slightly Less Buying Interest, Lower Opening Price丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market was generally weak. Because the foreign wheat report was one or two jiao lower, the hearts of people inside and outside the industry naturally turned flat. However, the actual chips this year have always been unsmooth. Both buyers and sellers find it difficult to use their minds. It is estimated that the chips of the experts have not arrived at the time, and they are unwilling to release the files. Only the buying interest is weaker, and the opening price is slightly weaker.</p>
<p>The result was one fen lower in February and March, and there was no comparison in the rest.</p>
<h3>Chicago Wheat Turned Weak</h3>
<p>On Tuesday (6th), Chicago wheat first rose due to the strong spot market, and then fell due to the weakening of corn. Also, the total turnover on the 5th was 20 million bushels. The market prices on the 6th are listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price    Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>December Futures    43.75    Down 0.750</p>
<p>May Futures    47.50    Down 0.875</p>
<p>July Futures    47.75    Down 0.750</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea, Precious Eyebrows, and Pearl Tea Sales in France Slightly Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Precious Eyebrows and Pearl Tea of the Lu Zhuang and Tu Zhuang routes, sales in France were slightly active. Yongxing, Tongfu, Duddell, Jinlong and other foreign firms talked about more than 600 boxes, and most of them have not yet been put on the books. Although the selling price has not risen or fallen, it is feared that it will still be stable. Russian Association still takes a wait-and-see attitude towards Gongxi green tea. The Whitehead firm has filled its stomach and must wait for a telegram from Mumbai before it can continue to search for it. At present, it seems that there is no hope of development.</p>
<h3>The Market Price of Sugar Crude Sugar Fell Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market, although the gold was stable, the importers were waiting and watching and did not move forward. The association's auction price was still weak. The auction price of No. 24 crude sugar white was 14 taels, 4 qian and a half, and another small 5 fen was still less handled. No. 18 medium sand, white 14 taels, 4 qian and a half, was also a small 5 fen. No. 20 medium silicon white was 14 taels, 6 qian and a half, and small amounts of money were rarely traded. For No. 24 crude sugar white, the foreign firm quoted 4 yuan and 2 jiao Dutch currency, and No. 8 Dutch red was 3 yuan and 7 jiao Dutch currency. All can be telegraphed, but each firm's intention to import is very weak, and it has not yet approached. The arrival and sales of Chao Qing are rare, and the market trend tends to be weak.</p>
<h3>Southern and Northern Goods, Longan Pulp, Have Been Abandoned and Became Stagnant</h3>
<p>Hainan Longan Pulp: In the past, because the increase was too fast, the cargo owners insisted on a high price and held on firmly. It was initially planned to pull it to 30 taels, but because the sales of various parties turned stagnant, and at the same time, Lianzhou Longan Pulp fell back again and again, reaching 5 or 6 taels before and after. Therefore, after the previous batch of Hainan goods arrived and were abandoned for a long time, it has become stagnant. Now, it cannot be too high, nor can it be too cheap. It is in a dilemma, and the quotation is still stagnant.</p>

<h3>Suicide</h3>
<p>— Tian Fang</p>
<p>Suicide, what a cruel term. The increase in suicides is a stark indication of social pathology. Yet, in countries that pride themselves on being "organized," it continues to occur. According to a Tokyo dispatch from the China News Agency on the 2nd,</p>
<p>the Japanese Social Affairs Bureau investigated and found that 1,490 mothers and children committed suicide due to economic panic, unemployment, and starvation. 812 young children were forced to die along with them.</p>
<p>If this telegram were seen by the representatives of the League of Nations in Geneva, I wonder if the Japanese representative Matsuoka, who is currently boasting so loudly, would consider it "regrettable"?</p>
<p>Originally, suicide cases in Japan were well-known. The art of suicide even includes the so-called "seppuku" method, which is said to be necessary to demonstrate "courage." But when a person reaches the point where they do not want to struggle with their environment and resort to suicide, their degree of courage is quite pitiful. This is what is called "Yamato spirit." Due to this cruel way of dealing with oneself, when reflected externally, it creates acts of aggression. This is an inevitable logic.</p>
<p>Historically speaking, Japan during the Sino-Japanese War was certainly different from Japan when it was forced to open trade by American warships. However, the current Japan is also vastly different from Japan during the Russo-Japanese War. After the "Sino-Japanese" and "Sino-Russian" wars, Japan did gain temporary prosperity and embarked on the path of capitalism. However, in recent years, due to the intensification of global economic competition and domestic social recession, the number of unemployed has increased from 480,000 to 500,000 between April of last year and September of this year. (Note: This is a country with a population of 70 million.) The leftward tilt of youth ideology (such as the large-scale strike by 20,000 students at Waseda University last year, and the recent series of major investigations) has particularly caused the authorities headaches. "Ideological guidance" may not be effective with empty words alone. Therefore, by exploring the cracks in the social organization, it can be seen that this "Germany of the East" is facing the danger of "disintegration." Although it is currently maintained by a tense atmosphere, the cracks are deepened by extreme tension. But at this time, the warlords are acting like madmen, recklessly and stubbornly trying to expand. Since forcibly occupying our Eastern Provinces since "September 18th" last year, although the people of our country have suffered losses in life and property, "killing three thousand, injuring eight hundred," the results for Japan have not been favorable. However, exchanging thousands of miles of land for the creation of thousands of orphans and widows has endless future troubles. If our country's economic severance and the armed resistance of the volunteer army can be sustained (not hoping for changes caused by international "competition for the deer"), we can see the collapse of this country, "whose ambitions were not fulfilled before its own destruction," within two years. Therefore, their way of finding a way out is "drowning in the river," more than just "going uphill." And our non-resistance is equivalent to suicide.</p>

<h3>Organic Pigments</h3>
<p>— Reconstruction</p>
<p>There aren't many natural organic pigments, such as indigo, gamboge, and sepia. In addition, there are also things called natural products, but are actually man-made. Organic pigments can be divided into two categories: those extracted from animals or plants, called natural pigments, and those obtained from coal tar, called artificial pigments. Within the scope of dyes, all organic pigments that combine with metal salts to form colored precipitates that are not easily soluble in water are generally called lakes. Several important natural pigments are listed below:</p>
<p>Gamboge丨Gamboge is a natural resin. Its bark is cut away, and a bamboo tube is used to collect the sap that flows out naturally. The juice is steamed off to obtain a yellow gelatinous substance. This gelatinous substance is gamboge. Gamboge has no definite molecular formula. It dissolves in water to form a thick emulsion, making it very suitable for watercolor painting. However, it cannot be directly used in oil paint and must be mixed with aluminum oxide and other fillers before use.</p>
<p>Sepia丨The squid's body has a small sac containing a black juice. It is taken out and dried, dissolved in sodium hydroxide solution, and hydrochloric acid is added, which produces a precipitate. It is filtered, dried to obtain a black pigment, which is durable and easily mixed with other pigments, and is mostly used for color painting.</p>
<p>Burnt Umber丨Made by mixing iron oxide with organic matter. Natural products are available, and it can also be made by burning bone fragments, oak wood, etc. It has strong durability, great hiding power, and is easy to mix with other pigments, so its application is quite wide.</p>
<p>Indigo丨Plants containing indigo originally contain a glucoside in their dry leaves. Indigo and glucose (CoHi2O6) are obtained through fermentation or acid decomposition. However, artificial indigo made from coal tar is now becoming increasingly common, and natural products are gradually being replaced.</p>
<p>Indigo is not easily soluble in water, alcohol, and other solvents and is not greatly affected by dilute acids. It can be dissolved by concentrated sulfuric acid. If sodium hydroxide is added to neutralize it after dissolution, a soluble sodium salt is obtained. The powder obtained by evaporation is the commercial soluble indigo, and its main uses are for making blue ink and coloring animal fibers. Its molecular formula is very complex, and the commonly recognized structural formula is:</p>
<p>C6H4 NH∨ NH4</p>
<p>∧CO Ci一C∧CO ∨ C6H4</p>
<p>Carmine Red丨When female cochineal insects are laying eggs, these insects are collected and steamed to dryness. Boiling carmine red with water yields a beautiful red solution. This pigment has acidic properties and combines with metals or metal oxides to form colored precipitate pigments, also known as lakes. Therefore, carmine red is a red pigment formed by the combination of its acid with aluminum or other metals. The red color is extremely bright, and the color of the compound with aluminum is the best, followed by tin compounds. It is very suitable for painting, coloring, and oil paint applications. It is fairly stable against sunlight, with only slight effects. The chemical molecular formula of carmine red is CiiHi2Oo</p>
<p>Madder Root Red丨Madder root red is mostly produced from the roots of the madder plant. Recently, it is also mostly made from coal tar. It is easily soluble in water and turns reddish-purple when it comes into contact with iodine spirit or caustic soda solution. This liquid combines with various metal oxides to form color lakes of different colors, for example, it becomes red with aluminum oxide, brown with iron oxide, brown with oxide, and red with calcium oxide.</p>
<p>Pigments made from madder root red lack hiding power. The use of this pigment lies in dyeing fibers. When used, it does not directly combine with the fiber; the fiber must first be immersed in a solution of metal salt, and then transferred to a solution of madder root red and boiled to combine. At this time, different metal salts can give different colors fixed on the fiber. Pay attention to this. Also, the main component of madder root red is alizarin, and its formula is as follows:</p>
<p>C6H4 ∧CO</p>
<p>CO∨ C6H2(OH)2</p>

<h3>Contradiction</h3>
<p>— Bin Fu</p>
<p>The evening breeze made people feel strangely cold. Countless rickshaw pullers huddled and shivered in the corners of the doorways, while Young Master Zhou paced back and forth in the reception room.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the doorbell rang outside, and Young Master Zhou hurried to answer it. A woman dressed in a semi-Western style walked in.</p>
<p>"Let's go, I'm too late." She said this as soon as she entered the door without sitting down.</p>
<p>The man didn't say anything, just looked at the woman's disheveled hair and the bright smile emerging from her crimson lips.</p>
<p>The two walked out.</p>
<p>The position where she carried her satchel on her left arm was now occupied by a man's right arm, and her satchel rested under the man's left arm. They synchronized their steps, walking very slowly. He felt comforted, and she felt happy; everything was warm and cozy.</p>
<p>"Miss Fang, last night at the Central Hotel, hey, thinking about it this morning still makes me feel happy."</p>
<p>"Don't mention it, I've already been scolded by my mother today!"</p>
<p>"Really? Then I'm truly sorry."</p>
<p>"Tch..............."</p>
<p>"My love, look at the falling yellow leaves, what a poetic autumn! Let's not waste such scenery. We're getting tired of watching movies every day; let's take a walk in the park."</p>
<p>The woman pondered for a moment and said:</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, I have a bit of a headache. Let's wait until tomorrow."</p>
<p>"Okay." The man felt a sense of disappointment, but there was no way to object to her.</p>
<p>They arrived at the entrance of a yellow-walled Western-style house.</p>
<p>"Goodbye, I'm sorry, come see me tomorrow." She took back her satchel and released his left hand.</p>
<p>"Hmm,……………………" He walked away in disappointment.</p>
<p>She entered her home, where another handsome face was waiting for her in the reception room:</p>
<p>"Why so late? You're making people wait impatiently." This man approached her, took the satchel from her, and then took her coat, hanging it on the coat rack.</p>
<p>"Are you impatient? Then why did you wait for me?"</p>
<p>"No, no, where? Where? My..., let's go, it's ten to five."</p>
<p>After changing into a brand-new evening gown, she and the man leaned intimately together on their way to the × Grand Theater. He felt comforted, and she felt happy.</p>
<p>×　×　×　×　×</p>
<p>"Yunmei, look at how clear and beautiful the moonlight is!"</p>
<p>"Yes, it's truly beautiful! It's a pity it's a bit cold."</p>
<p>"Are you cold?" He held her even tighter.</p>
<p>"No, I mean the moonlight in the autumn night makes people feel even more desolate. But I think the autumn night is truly full of poetry."</p>
<p>"That's right, I just don't believe people say spring is the most beautiful."</p>
<p>"…………………"</p>
<p>"Yunmei, I truly love you. You're truly my little angel. You're as full of poetry as the autumn night. Only this moonlight can compare to your pure beauty."</p>
<p>He hugged her even closer.</p>
<p>"Yunmei, I think it's getting late; let's go to the Oriental Hotel for a long chat tonight."</p>
<p>"Hmm, okay, tomorrow's homework is those annoying geometry and biology, I'm planning to take a day off."</p>
<p>They decided on their route and began to walk faster. He was infinitely gentle, and she was extremely proud. He felt more comforted, and she felt happier.</p>
<p>Passing by the brightly lit entrance of the Entertainment Square, the glaring lights illuminated the shadowy figures on the sidewalk, all of whom were women. These women's lips were as red as Yunmei's, and these women's hair was as disheveled as Yunmei's. But none of them seemed to be as "poetic" and beautiful as Yunmei, because they were all pursuing men, and no man was cherishing them.</p>
<p>"Ah, look, how pitiful!" She said sentimentally, pointing to the long line of women.</p>
<p>"Yes, selling their bodies isn't enough, they also have to endure the cold and hunger standing here all night! Alas!"</p>
<p>"……………………"</p>
<p>"Let's walk faster, Yunmei…………"</p>
<p>So they headed towards the Oriental Hotel.</p>

<h3>Thoughts on Reading "Colloquial Chinese Language Class"</h3>
<p>— Yi Ping</p>
<p>Three years after leaving school, the innocence of that time has been replaced by a mask. When I see many articles in this publication that describe life at school, I dreamily imagine the past; but I don't have the courage to pick up a pen and write about life back then. Today, after reading Master Fo’s "Colloquial Chinese Language Class”, I was reminded of my teacher, Mr. Sun Jingsheng.</p>
<p>Indeed, every student above the junior high school level is unwilling to put in more effort in Chinese language. The reason is that the school authorities pay attention to English, mathematics, and various sciences; it is enough to barely pass Chinese language, and most of the students are there for credits and diplomas. (Of course, I myself was like that too) But three years after leaving school, I have been completely eating by the pen, and I regret my past neglect of Chinese language. Moreover, I cannot help but think of Mr. Sun Jingsheng.</p>
<p>Sun Jingsheng is already over sixty years old and has a beautiful beard, like Mr. Yu Youren, but he is still old and strong, and always tries his best to teach us in class. Unlike other Chinese language teachers who pound the podium and slap the table because students do not listen to his lectures, Mr. Sun always persuades us with gentle words, sometimes even inserting humorous remarks so that we do not feel tired of Chinese language. If the students really fall asleep or prepare for the next lesson, Mr. Sun will definitely declare in advance before a particularly important passage that this passage is very important, implying that students who do not pay attention will have this passage as an exam question in the future. Therefore, the students think of the relationship between credits and devote themselves to this handout again, but there are also times when he deliberately declares this.</p>
<p>There is also the vernacular, which elderly Chinese language teachers always try their best to oppose. They think that what is the point of changing "blue sky" to "blue of the sky". But Mr. Sun is happy to go along with the students, and he is still studying the vernacular himself. Moreover, he welcomes students to his bedroom to chat, anything is fine, even talking about love is fine. There are many things about Mr. Sun. Because I was reminded of the fact that I did not study hard under the patient Mr. Sun when reading "Chinese Language Class", and now I feel the difficulty that the pen is not responding to my heart when I am making a living by the pen, I have written down some miscellaneous feelings.</p>
<p>Shop Assistant Communication</p>
<h3>A Difficult Problem</h3>
<p>As a staff member, I also manage the accounts. I dare to say that I am diligent in managing affairs and do not dare to neglect my service. However, recently, the store owner's wife (the store owner has other business to attend to, so he does not live here) borrowed 100 dollars from my account due to her smoking and gambling habits, and she has not returned it for a long time. Suddenly, the store owner checked the accounts, and I told him the truth. However, when the store owner asked the store owner's wife, the store owner's wife said, "I entrusted my nephew to give it to him this morning." Later, the store owner came back to my place, and I definitely told him, "I haven't received it." The next day, I met his nephew, and his nephew said to me: "Do you know what happened yesterday? The store owner gave the store owner's wife a big scolding, so the store owner's wife resents you very much, saying that you failed to cover for her. She took advantage of the store owner's absence and gave me the 100 dollars, ordering me to return it to you this morning, and instructing me to tell you to admit your mistake and say that you were unable to find it at the time. But I think such a statement is not appropriate for you, so when the store owner came to the store owner's wife's place for the second time to inquire, I took the responsibility myself and stated: "The store owner's wife did give me this dollar this morning, but I was delayed by other things, so I couldn't send it to the accounting office immediately. It is still in my pocket." This matter was then settled." After listening to it, I deeply admired his wisdom and appreciated his virtue, and I was about to express my gratitude and leave. However, when I thought about the store owner's wife's actions, I didn't know what her intentions were? I am afraid that the outcome will be more ominous than auspicious. How should I deal with this difficult problem in the future? I hope you will not hesitate to share your valuable opinions and give me your advice. I would be very grateful.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Li Ren</p>

<h3>Written to a Friend's Wife (Continued 1)</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Because all three of my younger brothers are half-siblings, we have absolutely no feelings for each other. We are worse than neighbors. Therefore, since I was young, I have had an unusual inclination towards classmates who had similar tastes, as a kind of consolation to replace "brotherly love." Zhou Dajing was also considered to have similar tastes.</p>
<p>The day before I left my hometown, Lin Baocheng 丨 also a classmate 丨 told me that Zhou Dajing had married a very beautiful and lively wife, and that she would be coming to Shanghai with him this time; however, he did not tell me your name at that time. To be honest, when I heard it, I didn't pay special attention to it, just like after reading a bland news item in the newspaper, leaving a very faint shadow in my mind.</p>
<p>"I never thought that Zhou Dajing, who had lost his youthful vitality due to the sorrow of unrequited love, would marry someone quietly; and marry a very beautiful and lively wife. How unexpected!" On the evening of the day I arrived in Shanghai, I decided to go to Seward Road to visit your new home. After the tram passed Dent Road, in my complex and chaotic mind, there was suddenly a thought focused on curiosity, rushing very quickly.</p>
<p>At that time, the house you lived in was truly elegant and beautiful. Short and dense shrubs were arranged like guards on the sidewalk in front of the gate. Although there were no colorful flowers in the middle, there was only a touch of deep green, but it looked even more beautiful and clean. In fact, a house like this is not worthy to house an angel like you! I often thought like that later.</p>
<p>When the sound of my patent leather shoes hitting the stone steps was very crisp, a short window with green gauze curtains was immediately opened. A man's head poked out. 丨 A very strange one.</p>
<p>The smooth and tidy long hair had been cut into a buzz cut as short as peach fuzz; the slightly yellow face seemed to have turned dark black from the long-term fumigation of gas; and a pair of deep-lensed glasses that he didn't have before had been added to his nose. Zhou Dajing had simply died once and been reborn!</p>
<p>"Who are you looking for?" Of course, I didn't recognize him, and he didn't see clearly that it was me. Like a sentinel during martial law, asking a pedestrian for a "password," I unexpectedly received this stern question from him.</p>
<p>The form can be changed as much as possible, but the voice always remains the same; thanks to him opening his mouth like this, I knew it was him. At the same time, a copper sign that was not very noticeable on the door, "Lawyer Zhou Dajing," suddenly caught my eye.</p>
<p>Of course, the words "lawyer" were not enough to surprise me: besides, at that time, I was still a normal friend with integrity, and there was no need to be surprised.</p>
<p>"I am Zhu Jinchi, a born communist." 丨 After I announced my name with a humorous tone, that Zhou Da lawyer of yours, who took marriage as revenge for losing his job, quickly opened the door and welcomed me out.</p>
<p>"Jinchi, it's you! Come in! Come in!" His warm and sincere welcome made me feel the joy of reuniting with an old friend. At that time, I almost wanted to hug him and kiss him!</p>
<p>Then, naturally, it was the scene of "Suddenly Meeting That Charming Nemesis." Dear little friend, you probably haven't forgotten it, have you?</p>
<p>Under the humorous, sweet, and quiet green light emitted by the light green light bulb, you, indescribably beautiful, were standing generously beside a purple-red embroidered curtain wearing a light green spring dress. The alluring smile, the flowing eyes, the beautiful contours; everything, everything, was as fast and powerful as the bullets fired by the Japanese Type 38 automatic rifle, directly hitting the depths of my heart.</p>
<p>Ah! God! Just in that moment of three or four seconds, my life's destiny was determined 丨 That was the thirteenth, and it was Friday, truly the most unfavorable day. The many sorrows, worries, struggles, and insomnia that I suffered afterward, and even today's escape, are all gifts given to me by this unfavorable day!</p>
<p>But I don't hate it at all, and I even want to thank it! Because I have already taken your bright red and warm heart from the opportunity it has given me. 丨 At least half of it, that's what I can guarantee myself!</p>

<h3>The Special Characteristics of the Soviet Film Industry</h3>
<p>— Ms. Wen Yin</p>
<p>The Soviet film industry has two distinct characteristics that distinguish it from the film industries of other countries: 1.</p>
<p>The Soviet film industry is state-run. From writing scripts, training actors, shooting films to distribution and screening, everything is completely under the control of the state. 2. The Soviet film industry is not a commercial, profit-making business, but a broad-based educational activity for culture and art.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the revolution, Soviet revolutionary leaders had long recognized the great significance of film in education and art. In order to strengthen the educational role of film, a decision was made that the content of all films must be reviewed by the People's Commissariat for Education and the government's propaganda department. The content of every film takes as its premise the education of the broad masses of workers and peasants, and guiding them to advance towards a new society. The government uses film to instill general and political education to the public, and to conduct extensive propaganda about the new society and its ideology. In the period when the culture of Tsarist Russia had been abandoned and the new Russian culture was continuing to grow, the role of film in the formation of mass art was particularly important and great. Completely reversing the traditional view of film as a pastime and entertainment, the Soviet Union uniquely recognized film as the art of the mechanical age, and further recognized it as the art of the masses, using it as a driving force for shaping the mass culture of the new society.</p>
<p>Because the Soviet authorities recognized the true value and function of film in education and art, the decision was made to nationalize the film industry. The Soviet law on nationalizing the film industry was signed by Lenin on August 27, 1919, and promulgated by the People's Committee. Before this, in February 1918, when the revolutionary government was first established, the Soviet People's Commissariat for Education had already established film specialized committees in Leningrad and Moscow to plan the film industry at that time. Since the promulgation of the nationalization law, the Soviet film industry has undergone a distinctly different change in direction from before, and its attitude of fighting for mass culture and mass art has become even more clear and resolute. The special development of the Soviet film industry in recent years is rooted in this. This is not only a milestone achievement in the Soviet film industry, but also a new era in the world film industry. (This article is taken from the Soviet Yearbook)</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>The Big Broadcast</h3>
<p>— Yan Nan</p>
<p>Half of Paramount's "Top Ten Special Blockbusters" for this year have already been moved to the screens in Shanghai. "The Big Broadcast," one tenth of the set, has been hailed as the best of the ten films by the American media. 丨 From my personal point of view, I also extremely sympathize with this view.</p>
<p>It is very similar to "Broadway Melody" and "The Great Gabbo", but it is much more interesting and powerful. The United States has been much more deserted for this kind of all-song film. After "Paramount on Parade," we can no longer see Paramount have this kind of film; 丨 There is 丨 This one. However, it is very obvious that this time there is an amazing progress.</p>
<p>It is not similar to any other musical; it has a complex plot, a huge amount of songs, and it tries its best to compress a very long story; and the second half is completely focused on songs. The wonder of the whole film lies in those songs; there are love songs, jazz songs, tragic Classic, and black folk songs. All of them have unique situational music, and sometimes some tap dance is interspersed, 丨丨 But the beauty of this kind of song and dance can never be described in words!</p>
<p>At the beginning, it takes a radio station as the center; the result is still there, adding a comedy of two pairs of lovers reuniting at the end. The narration in the first half makes the most of the wonderful parts of the plot, and the three actors also perform seamlessly! Even without song and dance, it can be called a "passionate masterpiece." The actors are all newcomers to the screen, but they will use ingenious methods to tell us everyone's names. The song and dance in the last section also adds the manager's few static performances, so that the whole film does not deviate from the topic. The photography and set design are all very artistic.…… In short, this director is really more superb than Lubitsch and DeMille.</p>
<p>If you usually like to watch movies, or are quite interested in American radio songs: then you would rather sacrifice any one thousand films, or even sell your radio, you should watch this unparalleled masterpiece!</p>

<h3>Tianyi Music Director Ma Loufen</h3>
<p>— Xiao Ma</p>
<p>Tianyi's Xiaosheng [young male lead] Ma Loufen is from Wuxian, Jiangsu Province; he grew up in Shanghai since he was a child. At the age of fifteen, he entered the attached middle school of Guanghua University. He usually liked to learn music. If there was a recreational party in the school, Ma Jun would enthusiastically participate in the performance; the students and teachers in the school praised him very much. After graduation, at the age of seventeen, he entered the Chinese Song and Dance Troupe founded by the modern songwriter Li Jinhui as a music teacher. His performances in Shanghai were able to win social praise.</p>
<p>Later, he followed Li to perform in the Nanyang Islands and other places, and was also praised by the local people; when he returned to China, he was eighteen years old.</p>
<p>After leaving Li's Chinese Song and Dance Troupe, he founded the Tianma Song and Dance Troupe himself; he performed in the Xiamen area, and then joined the Jimei Song and Dance Troupe run by Wang Tiyu, and traveled all over the Shanghai-Ningbo area. He was so confused for three years. Later, he was introduced by Li to Tianyi Film Company. Shao Zuiweng, the old owner of Tianyi, valued him very much, and invited him and Chen Yumei to co-star in a sound film "Girl Yunlan"; the results were not bad. Mr. Ma is now only twenty-three years old.</p>
<p>Talk about domestic films</p>
<h3>(I) After Seeing "Three Modern Women"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Lianhua's "Three Modern Women" was previewed at the New Light Theater the day before yesterday. I had the accidental opportunity to appreciate it.</p>
<p>"This is a film worth seeing," I will say at the outset. The film's structure is as follows: it is still a love story, in which three modern women of different classes simultaneously fall in love with one man. One is a socialite from high society; one is a woman from the middle class who is a lover of individualism; one is a telephone operator from a petit bourgeois background.</p>
<p>The story is quite perfectly interwoven, with twists and turns, but also with elements of "contrivance". Director Bu Wancang has made progress both in terms of consciousness and technique.</p>
<p>In terms of acting technique, it can be said that several important roles were quite successful, especially Ruan Lingyu; I admit that she has a special kind of intelligence.</p>
<p>Chen Yanyan is exactly that innocent, that pure. Li Zhuozhuo can also represent that kind of typical character. Jin Yan still maintains his usual achievements.</p>
<p>There are several good scenes, such as the realistic depiction of the coolies on the Bund. The dance scene lacked sophistication. Zhou Shuzhen's flying kiss ruined part of the plot. Chen Ruoying's suicide was too ordinary. The subtitles were imperfect, but some had literary meaning.</p>
<p>Finally, my conclusion is this: this is a successful work by Bu Wancang, although there are still some mistakes in it, but "everyone makes mistakes. As long as I can fully overcome these mistakes," I would like to present these lines of dialogue (from the subtitles) to Mr. Bu.</p>
<h3>(II) After Seeing "Little Actress"</h3>
<p>— Yi Lie</p>
<p>There are several sections that seem to lack authenticity and naturalness. Although there are distorted facts in a distorted modern society, the descriptions are somewhat exaggerated.</p>
<p>Ji Zhong's wife, Wang, and her lover, Chen Naixin, arrange a rendezvous by telephone, preparing to elope. Ji Zhong becomes ill with anger, moaning in bed, thirstily calling for water. His wife, Wang, not only does not give him water, but also complains loudly, unable to hear the telephone. Later, carrying her suitcase, she leaves. Afterwards, the same thing happens to Wang. Chen Naixin treats Wang in the same way that Wang treated her husband. This contrast, although exciting for the audience, inevitably has the ridiculousness of "play-acting" in terms of reality.</p>
<p>Chen Naixin goes to Wang's bedroom, and is seen by Xiao Lin, who tells her uncle and asks him why he doesn't get along with his aunt. Her aunt is friendly with other men; isn't her uncle angry? One is mediocre and muddled, one is smart and lively; the performances are vivid and thorough.</p>
<p>Yuan Meiyun, who plays Xiao Lin, truly has acting talent; although she is new to the camera, she doesn't seem inexperienced.</p>
<h3>(III) Some Opinions on "Struggle"</h3>
<p>— Qi Xi</p>
<p>The play "Struggle" certainly has "struggle," but unfortunately it cannot "struggle" to the end. Xiao Zheng joins the volunteer army and participates in the battle. If this war is about the Battle of Shanghai, then we failed in the Battle of Shanghai. Therefore, I would rather Xiao Zheng die in battle than have him return alive. If this war is about the Battle of the Black Water and White Mountains, then it is not yet time to return. Struggle means struggling to the end, but what does "Struggle" give us?</p>
<p>In the last two scenes, what is implied to us is: Xiao Zheng is wearing the uniform of the volunteer army, embracing his person - Yan Gu... Xiao Zheng has changed into a suit, and is boating with his lover. These facts tell us: Xiao Zheng's struggle for the country was not thorough; at the same time, his struggle for love was successful. This is the final result of my seeing "Struggle".</p>
<p>Minor Opinions</p>
<h3>Exploration of Film Publications</h3>
<p>— Xin Mo</p>
<p>For film fans, film publications are, of course, the most cherished reading material.</p>
<p>I guess a film fan doesn't have that much time to collect and read all the film publications! Perhaps there are such people, but most likely they only select one or two of the better ones!</p>
<p>Many people always start things but never finish them. Take film publications, for example. When some were first published, they were very satisfying to readers. This was not only a feast for the eyes of film fans, but also provided guidance in the film industry. Later, the content not only became less substantial, but also many worthless articles were published. Recently, several publications have made this mistake, filling the pages with trivial matters about female stars. If film publications are only about recording trivial matters about female stars, they will fundamentally become uninteresting publications.</p>
<p>Therefore, I hope that the gentlemen who edit film publications will not fail in their important mission.</p>
<h3>Open Letter</h3>
<p>To Mr. Yi Lie: Please send the original manuscript of "Chaplin in London." If it concerns something from 1921, it has been more than ten years ago, and it is probably no longer timely.</p>

<h3>Comparing the Studio to "The Land of Illusion"</h3>
<p>— Chen Dabe</p>
<p>This laughing exercise method is very related to your health. If you are determined to continue working hard in the art of performance, if you are determined to build your career in the studio, you will have to endure a lot of pain in the future, both psychologically and physically, pain that you would never taste in other professions.</p>
<p>Friends who have never experienced studio life only glimpse the bright side of the studio from the screen, and think that studio life is a kind of fun and ideal life. Some people see many brilliant stars, and even compare the studio to "The Land of Illusion." This is completely wrong.</p>
<p>The male and female staff actors in the studio are made of flesh and blood, just like the men and women you encounter in other groups. In other groups, you feel that the number of "petty people" is greater than the number of "gentlemen." It is the same in the studio. In school life, new students are often bullied by older students. When you are an extra or play a minor role in the studio, the bullying you suffer is probably even more than when you are a new student. Arrogant airs, sarcastic criticisms, and even rude rebukes and barbaric scoldings, in today's Chinese studios, can almost everywhere make a newcomer feel uneasy, and almost the same situation as a daughter-in-law in front of her evil mother-in-law.</p>
<p>As for working hours? In the studio, no matter in which country, there are no so-called legal hours. In those small companies that rely on the sun, you are busy from morning to night, and even eating becomes a problem. In those large companies that rely on electric light, your working hours can be extended until after dawn. When you see your blacklisted colleagues full of excitement, you are already so tired that your back hurts, and you just want to lie down.</p>
