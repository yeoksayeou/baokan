<h3>主席凡勒拉發表鄭重言論盼中日勿作破壞國聯行動</h3>
<p>外部接日内瓦我國代表團電告、國聯行政院二十五日下午三時半繼續開會、由李頓出席發表意見、國聯調查團五代表二十五上午曾一度會議、决定李頓出度發言之原則、在李頓發表意見後、如日代表不再事阻撓、中日問題即由行政院十四理事國代一討論一次、再將會議記錄及李頓報告書送十九國委員會、原定舉行兩星期之行政會議、預料在本星期六即可結束、如李頓報告後、日代表松岡仍須發言、則我國顧代表亦將要求發表意見之機會、如此則會議日期或即因此延長、至下星一或星二結束、</p>
<p>國聯行政院連日會議、討論李頓報告、原定由李頓致詞答覆中日兩方對報告書之意見、但以松岡之反對、直至二十四日會議由英西等國贊成、决定於二十五日下午三時半開會後、由李頓答覆、預料李頓所言、對報告書必作有力之維護、而對「滿洲國」問題、將再申言不能承認、松岡對此或將再作一度狡辯、故二十六日繼續會議、尚難即告結束、移送十九國委員會之期、或將展至下星期初、在移送之前、行政院將作一决議、對李頓報告前八章表示接受、至第九第十兩章因係解决辦法、將留特别大會討論、</p>
<p>今晨此間得悉國聯大會或將於十二月五日舉行特别會議、考慮中日爭案、此訊尚未徵實、但其日期似甚近情、因召集大會須在一星期前通知也、（路透二十五日日内瓦電）</p>
<p>日内瓦茲悉現已大致决定於十一月二十八日召集十九特委會、考慮中日爭案特委員會或將召集國聯大會、於十二月三日開會、（二十五日路透社電）</p>
<p>日内瓦今日午後行政院會議、因日代表松岡須請示於其本國政府、故下次會議定下星期一日舉行（廿五日路透社電）</p>
<p>日内瓦李頓調查團委員原有在國聯秘書處正式開會之說、但迄未舉行正式會議、聞今日曾在旅館中作非正式之談話、以期將其致行政院之覆文、減至可能的最短形式、（二十五日路透社電）</p>
<h3>昨日開會情形</h3>
<p>主席籲請雙方嚴重考慮</p>
<p>使中日案獲得根本解决</p>
<p>日内瓦國際行政院今日午後四時開會、首先處理提交行政院關於南美玻巴兩國爭執之報告書、及伊拉克與叙利亞邊界問題、然後復開始討論中日爭案、首先宣讀日本關於李頓調查團委員參加討論之意見書、據稱、調查團之工作、已於其報告書送達行政院時終止、日本不反對調查團委員之發問、但不承認其對於中日代表在行政院會議中所發言論陳述意見之資格、該意見書復聲明昨日松岡所採之地位、李頓勛爵答主席凡勒拉之問話、稱如調查團報告書果有助於行政院、則各委員當甚欣然、舍此而外、各委員不願再有所云、增入其報告書中、主席乃詢問會衆有無問話、捷克代表皮尼士起稱、渠覺最簡單之途徑、在將此全部事件提交國聯大會特會、渠保留在大會發表批評之權、主席旋問會衆、行政院可否再等候若干時而後將此案提交特别大會、就實際考慮之、似行政院不宜作一般的討論、此案提交大會審查、可不妨碍行政院理事對此報告書發表意見之機會、中日代表雙方所言者、皆未予人迅速解决此爭案之希望、雙方間似未有妥恊之任何程度、而爲行政院所可據以發表有希望之意見者、渠盼望現所有之中日見解、並不代表其政府之最後見解、並盼望兩方不致拒絕可一勞永逸之解决、如國聯機關不爲人許其儘量工作、或爲當事者任何一方面之不合作所妨碍、則直爲不可忍的反抗輿論之行爲、主席最後籲請雙方對於彼等所可爲以助國聯者、加以嚴重之考慮、</p>
<h3>凡勒拉松岡大起爭辯</h3>
<p>日内瓦今日午後顧維鈞與松岡舌戰後、主席凡勒拉應松岡之問、謂依渠意見、李頓調查團委員　列席行政院會議、而答覆行政院所願提出之問話、松岡問、此項問答、是否以報告書與意見書之範圍爲限、凡勒拉乃說明渠前晚提議、欲查明調查團委員所聞者可否使之願意修改其報告書</p>
<p>〓日代表反對調查團列席〓</p>
<p>松岡繼稱、如行政院與調查團得開始關於滿洲問題之問答、則此事將越出調查團任務範圍之外、且此項問答一經開始、討論或將歷一個月之久、因渠將保留向調查團委員詰問報告書以外事件之權也、凡勒拉答稱、調查團所將聲述之唯一問題、乃調查團是否仍願堅持其報告書、抑願修改之耳、松岡接言曰、如調查團覺未有改變其報告書之理由、則余當然不得不向之詢問何以不願修改、此種簡單的詢問、或將引起整個月之盤詰云、松岡與主席凡勒拉關於此點之爭辯、繼續多時、松岡始終以爲調查團不應參加行政院之討論、凡勒拉至是乃詢問行政院各理事之意見</p>
<p>〓捷西代表爲凡勒拉聲援〓</p>
<p>捷克代表皮尼士首先發言、　　謂主席對於尋常手續、已發公平解釋、渠完全與主席同意、調查團雖已完成其工作、但其存在尚未銷滅、故行政院有權向之詢問云、西班牙代表馬達利加贊助皮尼士之見解、謂渠未見有可反對調查團於聽辯論後表示意見之由、調查團理固已繕成一報告書、但如經請求、尚可供給另一報告書、故調查團有答覆任何問話之自由、調查團今猶存在、如討論因此延長亦何妨</p>
<p>〓西門舉德魯蒙前例贊助〓</p>
<p>英外相西門繼起發言、開首即舉出前例、以援助凡勒拉之决議、援引</p>
<p>國聯秘書長德魯蒙事、認爲早有此習慣、西門聲稱、調查團委員非以旁觀者資格參與此會、行政院之請其出席、顯然有一種有益的用途、此用途爲何、無非爲以其</p>
<p>贊助、給予行政院如今所議者而已、</p>
<p>〓松岡屈服許其書面答復〓松岡稱、德魯蒙之前例、愈堅日本之見解、渠不及對調查團委員說明其報告書中之經過伹渠在魇則上、反對調查團委員之干預行政院程序、渠請行政院許渠書面陳述日本見解、凡勒拉允之、但謂不可反對調查團之集會、俾考慮彼等願否修正或增加其報告書、行政院午後五時五十五分休會、定星期五日午後三時半復開討論</p>
<p>〓英人認日方反對無理由〓此間英人方面之見解、以爲日本加於李頓調查團之反對、出於誤會、窺松岡之態度、似抱有調查團乃行政院僕役、而非行政院批評者或其主人之感想、且恐調查團處於裁判者之地位、而判定唯行政院始可解决之各點也、西門所稱調查團之出席非爲壯觀起見一節、英人旁觀家頗重視之、行政院之利用其人員没務、乃合理之舉、此間輿情漸以爲中日問題、不久將直接交國聯大會辦理、不過或將由十九特委員會正式轉交之耳、衆謂行政院處理此事將、極感困難、因行政院之决議、必須全體一致同意也、是以極合實施之途徑、在國聯大會辦理此事、松岡所稱日本願爲忠實擁護國聯者一語、已引起深切印象、因其發言表示其國家情感之際、頗流露誠摯意思也、英外相西門明晚或須起程返倫敦、俾與英相麥唐納商榷因軍縮局勢而起之各點、數日内即將返日内瓦（二十四日路透社電）</p>
<p>〓播弄小策係日外交慣技〓東京據日外部接日内瓦電、松岡洋右力阻李頓發言、被認爲無端取鬧、藉以遷延行政會議爲目的、此乃日國會歷來慣用之辦法、歐洲及立憲國以爲日本弄小策、以避公正討論、日内部乃電命松岡代表勸勿因小事致失各國同情（二十五日華聯社電）</p>
<h3>宋羅昨向各使否認直接交涉</h3>
<p>日方造謠已司空見慣</p>
<p>南京國聯行政院連日開會討論李頓報告、日方竟大施造謠、謂中日間題有直接交涉之可能云云、行政院代院長宋子文外交部長羅文幹二氏、二十五日晨在北極閣宋氏私邸接見美使詹森·法使韋禮敦·德使陶德曼·意使齊亞諾·英代辦應標蘭等外賓談及此事時、宋氏正式聲明中日直接交涉說、絕對不確、每次國聯開會時、日方均謠傳直接交涉之說、已司空見慣、不足爲奇、現中日問題已入國聯之手、國聯應速謀一適當之解决、並維持國聯本身及盟約之尊嚴云、（二十五日中央社電）</p>
<h3>台維斯爲松岡唯一勁敵</h3>
<p>意人對滿案前途悲觀</p>
<p>羅馬意國對於國聯解决滿洲問題之前途、表示悲觀、前駐日内瓦之意代表馬利尼斯稱、自渠觀之、國聯將仍作微溫的建議、而使中日兩國所不能同意之問題依然不結耳、迦狄諾報稱、當事者如僅爲中日兩國、則此問題可自已解决、但中國之後、尚有美國、松岡在日内瓦所遇之眞正勁敵、非爲顏惠慶、但爲台維斯、台氏游倫敦巴黎羅馬時、不獨討論軍縮問题、且亦討論利於美國之滿洲解决方法云、（廿四日路透電）</p>
<h3>台維斯答訪松岡</h3>
<p>闡明美對遠東問題立塲</p>
<p>日内瓦美代表台維斯、今日上午十時半赴梅脫羅卜爾旅社、進見日本松岡代表、爲前日松岡代表往訪之答禮、後即會談遠東全局之問題、於同十一時十五分辭出、兩氏於此會見、懇談遠東之門羅主義、松岡力言爲確立遠東之和平、并進而維持世界和平起見、捨遠東門羅主義無他道、國聯之涉及遠東問題、係糾紛之原因云、台維斯當亦說明國聯審議中日紛爭之美國態度、至於遠東門羅主義未達到結論、（廿四日電通電）</p>
<h3>德外長否認袒護日本</h3>
<p>柏林德政府今日發正式聲明、否認日内瓦日報所載德外長牛賴資聲稱德國爲經濟理由、對於中日爭執必須袒助日本之說、謂此毫無根據、全屬謠言云、（廿四日國民電）</p>

<h3>日外務省召開首腦會議</h3>
<p>訓令松岡准出席十九國委會努力促成直接交涉</p>
<p>東京據日内瓦日本代表部到達外務省之公報、國聯理事會將中日問題移交總會、不日開十九國委員會之舉、殆已爲决定的、代表部關於對策已來電請訓、外務首腦部昨午後協議之結果、</p>
<p>（一）日本政府關於滿洲問題、雖反對依國聯規約第十五條開總會或十九國委員會、但理事會若將總會開會爲手續問题而以多數决採擇時、亦不强行反對、故在理事會席上、僅爲反對之保留而止、（一）在十九國委員上放棄從來之否認態度、由松岡代表爲說明員、堂堂闡明日本之主張、（一）若十九國委員會在日本方面確達諒解之結果時、日本政府决不躊躇、照旣定方針進行、全體意見一致、昨夜即將此旨、電訓日内瓦代表部、（二十五日電通社電）</p>
<p>東京據外務省接電、日内瓦大國方面之重要意嚮如下、㈠日本意見書不必視爲最終的意見、如能說得日本代表至或程度止、或能和緩、㈠在三事會之審議、務必短縮、提早開十九國委員會或臨時總會、如以多數說得日本代表、於意見書之和緩更有效果、</p>
<p>惟外務首腦部對此所持見如下、</p>
<p>㈠澈底使大國方面了解日本意見爲最終的意見、並非討價還價者、㈠使理事會十九國委員會臨時總會之討論重點、着重於「滿洲國」之現狀及將來、而不波及過去之問題、㈠滿洲問題最終的解决法、强硬主張可由中日直接交涉、惟此直接交涉、僅能使關係國以傍聽員出席、僅能於共同利害條項發言、原則的不許發言、㈠與此直接交涉併行的協議中國本土事項、開國際會議時、可招請關係國代表、（包含中日代表在内）（二十五日電通社電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>日本果退出國聯乎</h3>
<p>— 又玄</p>
<p>㈠　　×　　×　　×　　×</p>
<p>日内瓦外交旣已短兵相接。我國代表奮其毅力。以與侵略者爭鬭。北滿之義。軍亦以民族義憤。憑血肉而與飛機大砲相搏擊。苟世界上尚有「公理」「正義「存在者。則最後勝利必屬吾人。决無疑義。不過决勝之點。端在我國民之努力何如而定。不觀乎一二八事變乎。當戰事方酣。我全國上下一致以赴敵之際。國聯空氣及世界輿論。已轉而予我以精神上之援助。即表明「天助自助者」之非虚語。我不專賴國聯而奮力自衛。則國際間不難求得與國也。現時世界情勞略變。日本獨占侵略。愈見露骨。在國際間勢將陷於孤立地位。法國原同情於日。現在且公開聲明不豫備承認滿洲國。則日本失其操　國聯之把柄矣。乃倡爲··『國際聯盟者。歐洲之聯盟也是爲歐洲之必要機關。</p>
<p>歐洲以外并無何等效力。』且表白『日本對國聯之努力。三千萬之經費。而其所得利益則又何如。』其意若曰國聯旣不能帮助日本擭取東三省。國聯即失其作用者然。嗚呼。此種低級剌戟的煽惑。固足以激動彼國人民一時之情感衝動。然而世界各國豈盡皆受其麻醉。永爲日本軍國主義所迷耶。</p>
<p>自國聯去年十三票對一票决議以來。彼仍一意孤行。不顧國際信義。蹂躪非戰公約及九國公約。以彼鐵拳擊我東北。并打破世和平。而「門户開放機會均等」者出諸日人之口。殆爲一種外交上之說詞。故本月二十一日之行政會議。日本已失去各國之同情。日代表松岡雖强詞激辯。豈能完全顛倒事實。於是日閥之代言人丨外務當局者。乃發爲退出國際聯盟之讑調。其所持理由大要如下。</p>
<p>㈡　　×　　　×　　　×　　　×</p>
<p>『一。國聯乃以威爾遜精神。克勒滿沙勢力爲基礎。然美俄二國均未參加。事實上僅爲歐洲聯盟。自去年秋季以來。國聯之言　。殆已完全暴露其對遠東問題無發言之資格｛』</p>
<p>『二。關於滿洲問題。日本自有其傳統的國策。即不許他國容　其間是也。然而去年秋季以來。所以惱於國聯空虚之議論者。蓋惑於五大强　三大强國以及一等國之言。乃與不必要之國聯相週旋。致有今日。』</p>
<p>『三。滿洲之獨立與去年秋間之事態已完變化。日本對於國聯早有要求其撤回過問滿洲問題之根據。現在如許國聯再行審議。屈服於强壓主義之下。將來日本之對「滿」國策。將開受國際聯盟掣肘之端序。』</p>
<p>』故此時日本將不再持靜觀主羲。一舉以副國民之望而實行退出國聯。······同時勇往邁進表明爲遠東和平之决心，···』</p>
<p>於此可見日本軍部硬派主張。亦爲軍閥政治之一面也。吾人更回憶松岡洋右之赴日内瓦。道經蘇聯。滯留莫斯科者逾一星期。與蘇聯要人往復接洽。結果何如。局外人鮮能知悉。然而素以縱横見長之蘇聯外交家。豈肯任隨日本軍閥外交之玩弄。不過日人於此具有深心。方以此爲脅　英美威嚇法蘭西之有力工具。以便在國聯取得對東北問題之有利地位。</p>
<p>㈢　　　×　　　×　　　×　　　×</p>
<p>然則日本果將退出國際聯盟乎。如僅以外交方面之宣傳以作推斷。則未免失之片面。今又試舉本月二十一日彼國陸軍當局之談話以明之。「國聯調查委員會不認回復九月十八前狀態爲滿足。同樣亦承認滿洲還元至日本承認以前之狀態。亦不可能···則列國認滿洲之存在爲旣成事實矣。···」并主張該問題之特異性質。雖力排各小國之非議。并不似從前報告書發表當時非難攻擊之激烈據此觀之。縱使日閥不肯完全接受李頓報告書。但亦不至絕對反對。設使日本眞退出國聯者。其國内困難必且倍加。外交形勢亦將突變當此時也。日本之財政問題。歲出總額在二十二萬三千七百萬日金以上。而歲收總計不過十三萬三千萬日金其不足總額幾逹九萬萬元）日金。輾轉無策。乃以公債塡補。此實爲日本開國以來未有之畸形狀態。其中尤異者。陸海軍費數達八萬二千萬圓（日金。）而對東北侵略年費尚加保留臨時增添若干。亦不能預定則日本軍國主義者恐將不待乎戰爭之爆發。而財政即足爲致命的打擊。</p>
<p>日本雖不似德國賠欵爲之重累。而對外債務之履行。僅以正常關係而論。迄今年七月七十三種外債所受匯兌損失如下。</p>
<p>一九三二年度預定　　　　　較去年度增加數目</p>
<p>外債利息　一一八、八二○千圓日金　四三、四二七千圓日金</p>
<p>外倆償還額　六二、六三○千圓日金　五二、三四七千圓日金</p>
<p>計　　　一八一、四五○千圓日金　九五、七七四千圓日金</p>
<p>僅此而論其損失。已將近一萬萬圓。如以近日匯兌市價而論。將再增加一倍以上。如一旦退出國聯。則日本對國際信用。勢必更見衰落。財政破綻必將暴露。雖有雄兵三百萬。恐將不免進退失據。彼日閥雖强暴。未必不計及自身之利害也。則所謂退出國聯者。殆外以恫嚇各國。内以刺戟其民衆耳。豈必眞以其國作一擲之孤注耶。</p>
<p>我國對此强敵。審彼現勢。其能不乘時奮發有爲以圖雪恥。</p>

<h3>美國戰債態度引起各國嚴重反響</h3>
<p>英政府審愼考慮美國覆文</p>
<p>巴黎各報批評頗現失望意</p>
<h3>中日問題亦受影響耶</h3>
<p>▲路透社二十四日日内瓦電此間深慮美國戰債態度、將在日内瓦發生嚴重反響、不僅不利於軍縮問題、且亦不利於中日爭議、及世界經濟會議、華盛頓傳來之消息、已在法國　傾向美國對軍縮與滿案的主張之趨勢上、澆以冷水、故恐某方面或將表現激烈精神、惟英國之政策、向來獨立、且以實現事實上目的爲專務者、未必受戰債問題之影響、故就英國而言、戰債問題對於軍縮與遠東問題、未有立即的關係、</p>
<p>▲路透社二十四日倫敦電美政府答覆英國申請緩付十二月十五日到期債欵建議之公文、現正在倫敦各有關部分審愼考慮中、聞美國之覆文甚長、乃依昨日白宮宣言所述各節、表示美政府之意見、倫敦政界對於該問題、現嚴守緘默、外傳推料政府行動之種種言論、全非出諸負責方面、今日午後下院開會時、財政大臣張伯倫拒絕對該問題發表任何意見、美國覆文現尚未提交内閣討論、</p>
<p>▲路透社二十四日倫敦電前保守黨財政大臣賀恩今晚在下院演說、切言英國應繳付十二月十五日到期之美債、蓋英國財政近已有非常之恢復、而復不履行債務、則將損害世界信用結搆之全體、賀恩主張以金條付債、並主張暫取銷還債籌備金、以此爲應付美債之顯明方法、同時英國仍可依金鎊基礎向他國購其所需、賀恩指美國行爲、將延緩世界繁榮之恢復、賀恩又謂世界商務、用金鎊者佔過半數、而以英國爲中心點、英國之勢力在此、故政府在通幣事件上須負責任、並居於指導地位云、下院多數議員、贊助政府所抱英國有甚佳理由、可申請緩付下期戰債之見解、但對於賀恩所發英國應照付債欵、並以現金還債之說、亦鼓掌不已、</p>
<p>▲路透社二十四日倫敦電全部戰債問題、當然爲各方所討論、澳洲駐英代表卜魯斯、今日在美國俱樂部感恩節宴會演說、力言英美當道所負以相互諒解肅清一切障碍之責任、謂世界現正經過一種前所未見之危險、如欲解除其困難、則唯賴英美間之完全諒解與合作、而美國人民尤有更大之機會、與更大之責任、英國雖有此志願、但不若美國之有此能力、大戰時、英國在人力上與財政上之努力、及戰後對債務國之寬大待遇、已使自已精力枯竭、英國在過去十一個月中、維持其自已金融地位之行爲、已表示英國不復能再助他人矣、英國富庶、雖遇困難、猶力量偉大、爲他國所不及、今若不於短少時期内、設法使世界經濟制度恢復各國繁榮、則此制度將無繼續存在之望、目前之嚴重事件、僅爲十二月十五日到期戰債利息、應否照付抑或緩付之問題‘利息已緩付十五個月、但渠以爲今再展緩付息、將有心理上良好影響、而可促進世界經濟會議之成功、此會重要、莫可殫述、綜之、此會失敗、則戰債上之義務能有幾何、如此會成功、則此問題可迎刃而解矣云、</p>
<p>▲哈瓦斯二十五日巴黎電美國對於各債務國之要求、作否定之答復、各報批評、頗現失望之意、各報以爲歐洲各國之要求、極爲正當、胡佛總統所述之理由、未足以折服之、若干報紙以胡佛將戰債問題、與軍縮問題混爲一事、且似以此法壓迫法國、使之承認與國家安全不能相容之軍縮辦法者、故深表不滿、各報一再申說美國堅决態度、對於世界經濟、將引起危險之反感、其結果美國將感受不利、正與歐洲各國相同、惟多數報紙、實甚希望於新總統羅斯福、謂胡佛總統所行之政策、不當使羅斯福負其責任云、</p>
<p>▲路透社二十四日華盛頓電無論英國此後來牒如何措詞、若干債務國顯須於十二月十五日償付債欵、否則失信二者必居其一、國會議員對此决議、似已意見一致、彼等且不願贊成暫以外幣付債、至於設立委員會處理將來付債事之問題、意見尚未一致、被選總統羅斯福反對此議、渠殆欲有自由手腕、運用戰債、爲軍縮及世界經濟會議中之操縱工具、</p>
<p>▲國民社二十五日倫敦電自整理戰債形勢黯澹後、今日鎊價續跌、十一時零五分、英美匯價跌至美金三元二角二分半、爲英國放棄金本位後最低價、比一九一○年二月四日最低匯價、僅高美金一分半、同時黃金價格飛漲、已開至每盎斯一百二十七先令八便士、</p>
<p>▲哈瓦斯二十五日里加電拉特维亞共和國政府、向美國請求將十二月到期之戰債、計美金十四萬八千元延期付還、該國同時向英國請求延付七月與十二月間到期之兩批債務、其數目各爲三萬七千五百鎊、</p>
<h3>日本豫算案</h3>

<p>日聯社二十五日大阪電高橋藏相本日在此舉行之關西銀行大會席上演說、其要旨如次、世上一部對於歲入不足問題、提唱增稅說、然在本期内决無增稅之事、又有對於發纤巨額公債、以爲財政前途危懼者、然發行巨大公債之原因有三、㈠中外不景氣之結果减少稅收、㈡滿洲事件費及與此關聯之國防費增加、㈢所謂時局匡救費是也、歲入之减少、一經財界之好轉、則不數年而可恢復昭和三年以前之狀態、又能達到改正諸稅之時期、滿洲事件費及國防費、並非永久需要、如此巨欵、時局匡救費、三年之後、可見効果、今日如此歲入之大缺乏、爲一時的現象、余信此種原因、將可消滅、數年之後、日財界回復原狀、現在外匯行市低落之根本原因、在於國際間之政治的及經濟的事情、諸致之不安狀態、在幣制搖動之時代避免諸國資本流出國外爲重要問題、政府制定資本逃避防止法律現已實施、如無効果則不得不改變法律、</p>
<p>▲電通二十五日東京電日本商工會議所、昨在東京會館開懇親會、席上會頭鄕誠之助男、批評政府之明年度豫算、對其不均衡及國家財政之不安、有所論及、時列席之荒木陸相、起而反駁、謂剛纔演說、似軍部爲不生產的消費者之總樞、要知目下國内思想、動搖不安、反對資本主義之運動、風靡全國、蓋值熱烈已極思想的非常之時、國家財政不過此非常時之反映而已、若謂其責在政府甚或單在軍部、則過於認識不足云、</p>
<p>▲路透社二十五日大阪電日本銀行總裁土方、今日在銀行家會議潢說、請衆對於日本財政前途、勿抱悲觀、然亦不可過抱樂觀、蓋將因此而促成投機熱也、土方又對通貨膨脹過甚致警告、蓋在大衆購買方力未增之前、而物價陡漲、將危害民衆之故、土方又主張實業合理化、</p>
<p>興登堡服從憲法不允希特勒組織獨裁内閣</p>
<h3>中央黨組閣亦無望德國政局極形器重</h3>
<p>▲路透社二十四日柏林電今日午後、希特勒接興登堡總統函‘婉詞拒絕其組織總統内閣之申請、函内謂渠不能以總統之權力、授予一黨之領袖、蓋此種内閣、將造成一黨之迪克推多制、而使德國人民間之緊張狀態、益轉劇烈片渠遵誓言、並秉天良、不能負此責任云云、希特勒現責總統與其顧問、不以誠意待之、國會議長戈林、今日對新聞家宣稱、觀總統之行爲顯然從未直欲授權與希特勒云、</p>
<p>▲國民社二十四日柏林電德總統拒絕國家社會黨希特勒提議後、即請中央黨領袖喀斯試組一集中内閣、喀斯刻正與本黨要人商榷、是否接受總統委託、聞渠曾告總統、受命與否、將於星期五晚問答復、又聞德總統拒絕希特勒提議時、曾表示希望希特勒將繼續與政府合作、倘希氏欲進謁、渠甚樂於接見、共商政治事件、至希特勒之提議、曾附說明、謂渠認國會内閣、尚非完全不可能、不過照總統所定條件、則無法組織云、</p>
<p>▲國民社二十五日柏林電中央黨領袖喀斯組織國民集中内閣之希望極㣲、因此咸認回復總統内閣、勢已什九確定、目下各方所揣測者、祇爲新總理究將仍屬巴本、抑另界他人、惟此時無論何人組閣、其任務殊不易易、因國家社會黨與共產可以聯成反對政府之多數派、逆料新政府不久即將在國會失敗、故現有許多人信不日將再行總選舉、以冀打破反政府派之多數地位、因若再行總選舉、國家社會黨喪失之席數、必將超過共產黨所得之席數也、果爾則將易於組成穩定政府惟商界則仍亟欲避免再度選舉運動、以防國内經濟狀况受其影響、至國家社會黨態度已切實决定、不參加國民集中内閣云、</p>
<p>▲國民社二十五日柏林電今日各報論調、自極左至極右、莫不謂德國政局、極形嚴重、且非常困難、對於此時是否適宜組織國民集中内閣、抑宜回復巴本超然總統内閣、雖各報意見不同、但無一能開陳建立穩定政府途徑者、蓋照目前形勢、即令喀斯能聯合中央、國權及人民三黨顧國家社會黨方堅持希特勒組閣之要求、能否願與喀斯合作、俾在國會佔大多數議席、亦殊屬疑問云、</p>
<p>國民社二十五日柏林電今日正式發表德新國會定十二月六日召集、</p>

<h3>俄波侵犯條約</h3>
<p>下星期可批准</p>
<p>▲國民社二十四日華沙電波蘭報紙對於羅馬尼亞之拒絕與蘇俄訂立互不侵犯條約、均一致表示惋惜、惟認羅馬尼亞此種强硬態度、不致有損於波蘭與蘇俄間之和睦、且或恐將因此而增進波蘇兩國間之睦誼云、茲復從半官方面探得消息、波蘇間之互不侵犯條約及其附帶約文、如規定四人公判委員會之調解協定等約、於下星期三日、可以在莫斯科會議中批准云、</p>

<h3>廣西民團之鳥瞰</h3>
<p>南寧通訊、廣西民團、成績斐然、故辦理經過及其變遷、有足爲國人道者、爰槪述如次、亦關心團務乾不可忽也、</p>
<p>民團之組織過去之廣西民團、因無組織訓練、其力量亦極㣲弱、迨民國十八九年間、因省局變亂、第四集團軍總司令李宗仁、副總司令白崇禧、感於省内匪氛未靖、及民衆之渙散、知非積極訓練民團、不足以綏靖地方、於是派員督率訓練各縣民團、從事綏靖工作、卒賴民團之𦔳、底定全省、十九年秋、省府在南寗設立廣西民團總指揮部、白崇禧任總指揮、梁瀚嵩任副指揮、隨卽釐定民團組織暫行條例、並依舊府制之區域、酌量變更其管轄區域、分爲十二區、區設指揮官一人、副指揮官一人、督促辦理各縣團務、各縣設民團司令部、以縣長兼任司令、副司令則由民參議會選舉當地聲望素著兼有軍事學識者三人、呈由總指揮部選任、到於各縣之常備隊、則酌量各縣之治安情形與財力厚薄、定其隊數、每縣一隊至三隊不等、其組織系統、總指揮部下爲區指揮部、區指揮部下爲縣司令部、縣司令部下爲常備隊、至本年一月間、白總指揮以民團爲省行政之一部、應由省府辦理、迭經開會討論、規定廣西民團條例及省政府團務處、組織規程、旋於四月底將民團總指揮部撤消、所有民團事務、自五月一日起、歸併省政府主持、團務改由省府辦理、并更認眞整頓、其改善之事項如下、㈠劃全省爲六個民團區、（南寗·梧州·百色·龍州·桂林·柳州·）㈡擴大區指揮部之組織、㈢增加區指揮部之特務隊、㈣區指揮部·縣司令部·特務隊·常備隊·及訓練後備隊之費用、均由省庫支給、㈤民十九年後、因辦民團所籌之苛雜捐稅、一律停止征收、減輕民衆負担、（六）各級人員、以本縣及鄰縣爲原則、㈦廢止選舉副令制度、改由政府委充、㈧減少常備隊、注重後備隊、件定分十期訓練、限五年完成、㈨以後備隊團丁、担任防守維持治安等責、㈩使團丁致力於墾植工作、以發展生產事業㈩㈠對民團施以民衆補習敎育、使具公民常識、㈩㈡以民團爲勦匪之主力、省府對於上列各項、已次第實行、此爲廣西民團組織變遷之大槪情形也、</p>
<p>▲民團之編練廣西民團、分常備隊·預備隊·後備隊三種、常備隊係於縣區域内合格壯丁徵調編綀之、預備隊於常備隊團丁訓練期滿退伍後編定之、後備隊於編練常備隊預備隊之外、所有應徵壯丁、盡量編之、先就編制言之、常備隊分三種編制、甲種、每隊爲三排九班、計設隊長一員、隊附三員、班長九人、團丁八十一人、乙種、每隊分兩排六班、設隊長一員、隊附一員、班長六人、團丁六十六人、丙種、設隊長一員、隊附一員、班長四人、團丁四十四人、預備隊後備隊與常備隊之編制相同、惟後備隊則以甲種編制爲原則、常備隊團丁徵調、係由縣民團司令部於前期常備隊團丁尚未退伍之兩個月前、根據所屬各區調查册所報之後備隊壯丁人數總額、將本期應徵團　數目、適當分派各區團局照數依限徵送、各區鄒長及後備隊長奉徵調令後、應就所轄後備隊中、體察各丁户藉生活較　兄弟較多者、儘先徵調、訓練方面㈠常備隊訓練、由縣民團司令及督練官督飭各隊長隊附、依照省府所頒發之學科術科進度表、實施訓練、并由區指揮按期派員考察、呈報省府、至訓練期間、前定爲四個月、現定爲六個月、訓練期滿、卽行退伍、㈡預備隧之訓練、常備隊退伍後、卽由各區團爲及村甲、將該區村退伍團丁登記、編成預備隊、如未足一隊、則暫練爲一排或一班、練配成隊後、由縣民團司令部於每年各季中、擇定日期及適宜地點、訓練一星期、在此訓練期間、并注意於聯防方法、國恥紀要、禦防工作、以及墾荒築路種樹等項之指導、㈢後備隊訓練、亦由縣司令部派督練官及隊長隊附分期召集訓練、計今年上半年訓練常備隊四百四十四隊、預備隊之訓練隊數與常備隊相等、迨七月改設團務處後、實行減少常備隊、注意訓練後備隊、以省經費、而增實效、故祇編常備隊甲種七十六隊、乙種一百一十二隊、丙種九十六隊、團丁總數爲一五九六○人、至後備隊之訓練計劃、按全省壯丁約三百萬人、盡數編爲後備隊、每隊以九十人計、應編爲三萬三千餘隊、每年訓練十分之二、卽六千六百餘隊、本期决訓練三千三百隊、其訓練人員每五隊須設督練官二人、共需督練官六百餘人、現已着手進行、</p>
<p>▲人員之養成訓練民團之人才、需要極多、如區部縣司令部之職員及常備隊之隊長隊附及督練官、均需用軍事專才、省府除將去年所辦之警衛幹部畢業人員委用、并調軍官擔任外、仍時感人才不敷支配、現復繼續訓練此項團務人員、并决定以本省各高中學生、（因本省高中生均受軍事訓練）擔任民團訓練工作、</p>
<p>▲民團之經費民團經費、以前總指揮部區指揮部之經費、均由省庫支給、區部特務隊之餉項、多由各縣攤籌、至各縣司令部、及常備隊费用·完全由地方負擔·以致各縣捐稅繁增、人民艱於負擔、自本年七月、團務　由省主持後、所有省團務處、各區指揮部縣司令部及常備隊後備　、一切經常費、均由省庫支給、計團務處年支五萬五千九百餘元、各區指揮部年支二十九萬八千一百餘元、特務部年支三十七萬八千餘元各縣司令部年支五十九萬九千餘元、常備隊年支一百四十八萬一千五百餘元、後備隊年支四十八萬元、加以省區預備費四分之一、合共約年支三百九十餘萬元、但各縣之預備費、仍保留十九年以前　團欵支給、（非因辦團加捐者）或另行妥籌、民團經費、改由省給後、各地之苛雜稅捐、一律廢除、民衆遂釋重負、</p>
<p>▲實施民衆敎育廣西自决定積極訓練團後備隊後、每年受訓練之壯丁、近十餘萬人、敎育廳以此種後備隊、均爲本省民衆之精壯分子、如能就其訓練期間、施以民衆補習敎育、則五年之後、全省壯丁、均具有公民常識、而本省將無一失學文盲、民衆敎育、可期普遍、敎育廳特擬具民團後備隊施行民衆補習敎育辦法、提出省府委員會决議通過後、卽擬就施行細則、規劃籌集經費、着手編印課本、定於二十二年上學期施行、</p>
<p>▲民團墾植工作、省政府以辦理民團、其作用不僅爲綏靖地方、且爲組織民衆訓練民衆之基本辦法、對於發展農業、民團應負極大責任、前經規定各縣民團司令部、於常備隊訓練之外、須督飭其從事墾植工作、現各縣民團、均設有民團林·或民團農塲、邕寗縣民團墾植、成績最著、其他各縣之民團墾植、亦能收相當之成效、最近省政府復計劃由各縣司令部、酌定區域按期徵調後備隊、從事墾植、依此計劃進行、則數年後、省内荒地、必開墾完竣、本省之農業、當日益發展、</p>
<p>▲民團綏靖力量廣西自十九年辦理民團以來、各縣治安、多由民團維持、卽剿匪剿共各項工作亦以民團之力爲多、近如共魁韋拔羣之授首係得力於民團之截擊、使韋匪勢窮力盡、不能竄逃、又共匪首領藍志仁、率衆逾千在凌雲鳳山各屬、亦被民團將藍擊斃、并悉數殲滅其殘部、其餘各縣剿匪成績、均卓著成效、故目前本少各縣、多數不須軍隊駐防、而地方安靖、匪徒匿跡、可見民團之實力、殊不亞於軍隊矣、</p>
<p>總觀上述情形、廣西民團、不但爲他處民團所不及、且開民團促進政治及建設事業江之先河、故殊足紀也也、</p>

<h3>章嘉宣化蒙旗</h3>
<p>— 李建章</p>
<p>中央特任章嘉宣化蒙旗、已多日矣、惟因宣化使署組織條例、尚未正式公佈、遷延數月、未經成立、今日中央日報内載「蒙旗宣化使署組織條例、於昨日已由行政院第七十七次會議通過、不日卽行公佈、並謂朱予橋張學良等、迭電五台山、邀請章嘉赴平、共商大計章嘉已準備下月初下山、赴平就職、成立公署、開始辦公後、卽行出發蒙旗宣化、以副國府付託之重云云、建章以此事關係重大、爰就管見所及、特爲文以論之、</p>
<p>夫蒙旗者、卽指巴圖塞特奇勒圖部三旗、車城汗部二十三旗、土謝圖汗部二十旗、三音諾顏部二十四旗、札薩克圖汗部十九旗、賽音濟雅哈圖部十九旗、呼倫貝爾部八旗、唐努烏梁海部五旗、靑塞特奇勒圖部十旗、烏納恩素珠尅圖部十旗、伊克明安一旗、東西布特哈二旗、阿拉善一旗、</p>

<p>老死不相往來、蒙族不知有中央、中央忘記有蒙族、雙方隔閡、情感消失、而多數蒙人、至今仍服清制、奉清號、不各中原是誰家之天下者、實不能全歸咎於蒙人之不開化也、長此以往、則總理所明望之國族、卽整個之中華民族、保能形成、而國家何能奠於磐石之安也、</p>
<p>且俄當帝政時代、視外蒙爲盤中肉、乘中原發生革命之際、卽煽惑外蒙活佛、乘機獨立、中央爲息事寗人計、於民國四年、簽訂中俄蒙協約、許其自治、嗣俄亂日熾、蒙人不堪其擾、於八年取消自治、歸政中央、逾二載、白　黨恩琴不得志於俄、遂圖庫倫、捕勝活佛、未幾、蘇俄泊遣紅軍入蒙、驅逐白黨、於民國十三年、復助蒙人獨立、成瑚</p>
<p>立共產主義之蘇維埃共和國、爾時赤俄紅軍、表面雖屬撤退、而實權仍操於第三國際者之掌握中也、外蒙之此次獨立、雖因少數韃靼蒙古人、被赤色麻醉、自酖其毒而不悟、而彼邦明達之士、深知此種獨立、並不利於整個之蒙古民族、而先覺亞本丹薩等、即秉承總理主義、組織國民黨、保護國敎、倡現民族自决、因外蒙人種、以額爾额人種爲正統、彼認爲成吉斯汗之後、人口計有三百餘萬、佔全數外蒙古人三分之二有奇、亞本丹薩、卽此旗中之皎皎者、而其餘一百萬人、屬於韃靼種、卽蘇俄恃以宣傳　赤化、而爲宰制外蒙之工具、人數相差、旣如是懸殊、赤化非出於多數蒙人之自動、而赤色政府之不易永久樹立、於此可見一班矣、惟赤俄恃第三國際之威力、抺煞一切、立意孤行、詆毁宗敎、肆意宣傳、復於焚燒庘倫大寺、屠殺敎徒一萬餘人之時、而國民黨之首領雅本丹薩、亦因此被害、於是羣龍無首人數雖多、暫亦不易　其志、而赤化分子羣相驚喜曰、「無吾敵也已」、於是毫無忌憚、爲所欲爲矣、並持其勝利之餘　、而復有超越外蒙六盟一百十一旗、從事内侵之趨勢、此蒙旂北方之危機、亦卽　受赤禍之大略也、</p>
<p>吾人復移視線向東觀之、上年暴日内犯、佔我三省、而原遼西之哲里木盟十旗、黑西之呼倫貝爾八旗、已暫屈服倭奴、不爲我有矣、加以熱河爲東北要樞、華北門户、當九一八以前、雖形勢不若遼吉黑之重要、今則遼吉黑三省淪於敵人之手、其熱河之重要、當非逈昔可比、且就敵方言之、如得遼吉黑而不圖熱河、終爲心腹之患、一旦對俄有事、我國苟起而收復失地、卽腹背受敵、在軍事上爲被制於人、故敵人未得熱河之前、一似芒剌在背、必不能多享三省之利益、倘能併熱河與三省爲一區、則非獨可固三省、不受腹背之威脅、並可絕我收復失地之途徑、且可轉而威脅我平津、窺我華北、以侵我中原、我平津處熱河山海關水陸逼視之下、將一籌莫展、有若無實若虚、平津失勢、則華北危、華北危、則全國無復有寗日、存亡操之人手、可無待筮龜而立决、此所以日本之論滿蒙、而將原滿蒙政策中、包含蒙部之範圍、僅限於哲里木盟者、而日渐擴大已至熱河全境也、今則前羊雖亡、而後牢亟須待補以免暴寇之由入門而至於升堂、惟蚩蚩蒙人、思想落後、素乏國家觀念、復與中央無相當感情、奸人利用、易於爲力、據本月十九日華聯社瀋陽電謂、「日浪人團受關東軍密令、分赴各地、煽動利誘散住東三省之無聊蒙古民衆、昨日在蘇家屯開蒙族大會、司會者爲日浪人、决議文及宣言文案、乃日軍部手定之官樣文字、内容大略謂、「滿洲國獨立、出於三千萬華人之自决、否則七、十萬蒙古人、將來必遭亡種滅族、望國聯勿責日本、贊助僞滿洲國等語、赴會參加民衆、咸不知其所爲、祇圖得幾許路費、會畢卽鳥獸散矣、日人乃以蒙族名義、致電國聯、誇稱蒙族亦擁護「滿洲國」云云、其日人之處心積慮、可以窺其一斑、且同時復集大軍、壓臨熱邊、密遣偵探、傳遞軍情、國聞社最近消息、「根據熱河來人談稱、日軍暗探密佈熱河境内、近被義勇軍李賜如部捕獲六人、均已拘留、並未槍殺、彼復派遣大批婦女、以僑居爲名、往返赤峯朝陽間、暗通消息日本軍復於朝陽大本營、厚集兵力、築壘嚴守、最初不過千人、近數日間、復增一倍、合計達二千餘人、此部軍隊、據捕獲間諜聲稱、係爲明春進窺熱河、及擾亂平津之用者、而熱河防務之吃緊、於此足以證明矣、</p>
<p>夫外蒙之六盟部一百十一旗、計有四百五十萬人、佔七十餘方里、脫離吾國而附庸於赤俄、遼西哲里木盟十旗黑西呼倫貝爾八旗、復暫屈服於日、所餘者尚未足原有旗數之一半、加以赤俄卵翼下之敗類、意圖南犯、日本新興之軍閥、力事西進、恐不數年間、而此不足原有之半數蒙旗同胞、均不能共戴靑天白日之國旗矣、此就中國現時所處之境遇言、变就整個中國之前途言、實有亟應宣化蒙旗之必要也、（未完）</p>

<h3>今日風雨無阻上海香港埠際足球賽</h3>
<p>丨下午三時起在逸園丨</p>
<p>上海隊守勝於攻</p>
<p>香港隊攻勝於守</p>
<p>形勢平均各有機會</p>
<p>上海香港之埠際足球比賽、將於日下午三時風雨無阻、在亞爾培路逸園足球場舉行、埠際足球賽、已三年未在上海舉行、原定去冬港隊來滬、卒因一二八之變而罷、今日之賽、乃補去年未舉行之比賽也、今日大戰之種種情形、彙刊如次、</p>
<h3>上海陣線</h3>

<p>▲裁判員巴拉脫邊巡員馬計爾、勃脫、</p>
<h3>勝負觀察</h3>
<p>▲上海上海隊表面觀之、爲一極精强之師、然此爲守勝於攻之一隊後衛人才、無可訾議而前鋒之中、殊有令人難以滿意者、五人之中、射門之人才太少、鮑爾敦爲特務隊右翼、今以不加試賽、而以之充中將、加以推納亦未曾參加試賽、得失利害、不容多言、總之上海守則有餘、攻則不足、</p>
<p>香港香港之前鋒實力精强一目了然兩翼皆佳中間三將、亦皆能戰、後衛我人未見其表演、惟據莫領隊言、港隊後衛欠佳、則港隊、攻勝於守因此勝負之預測、皆謂港隊處於攻位而滬隊則處於守勢、港隊又似佔優勝、然滬隊前鋒得此堅强後衛之送托、未始無進攻之機會、則雙方機會平平、事前之預料、恐皆危險也、</p>
<h3>埠際略史</h3>
<p>埠際賽起自一九二四年、香港電聞報ＨongＫongＴlegraph捐贈埠際銀杯一、各埠足球隊、均可參加又賽、但每年祇准一隊、如祇有兩埠加入、第一次比賽獲勝者、卽得是年之錦標、若無勝負、則當重行比賽、若有三隊加入、則須輪流比賽、而以得分最多者勝、若得分相同、惟有再行比賽、以定甲乙又埠際賽之選手、至多不得過十五人、以示限制、遠東自有埠際賽迄今、大抵祇有滬港比賽、一九○八年、上海西聯足球會曾派隊至香港、與香港足球會比賽、以三對○大敗而歸、一九一三年香港足球會亦曾派隊至滬、在跑馬廳比賽、結果爲一比一、乃延長時間、滬隊卒得勝利、是爲第一次合法之埠際賽、繼因歐戰停止多年、直至一九二二年、滬港兩足球會、始擬恢復、香港足球會請上海足球會派隊前往、上海足球會雖值經濟萬分困難之時、亦毅然應允、於一九二三年春比賽、滬隊竟以三對零獲勝、實爲始料所不及、一九二四年在上海比賽、最有精彩、第一次在西捕球塲以三對三成和局、第二次比賽、雙方之競爭尤烈、其勢力亦甚平均、但上海於時間將屆之時、卒以左内鋒柯爾巧之一球而獲勝、（按本年柯氏係代表天津隊）一九○五年在港比賽、港隊以三對一勝、一九二六年在上海棒球場比賽、港隊之球藝雖佳、卒以四對五失敗、上海有三球均係罰球踼進、一九二七年上海在香港以四對零失敗、一九二八年則以七對零在棒球塲大勝香港、一九二九年香港以三對零勝上海、一九三○年、上海以五比二大敗香港、一九三一年之比賽、在香港舉行、上海在一比三之險境中、竟能連中三元、以四比三反敗爲勝、自一九○八年至今、雙力共賽十一次、計上海勝七次勝球二十八、香港共勝四次、勝球共二十三、</p>

<p>女籃球空前大戰兩江戰勝東南</p>
<h3>結果三十八比三十三</h3>
<p>〓兩隊球藝均佳無分軒輊〓</p>
<p>〓東南因最後慌張而失敗〓</p>
<h3>乙組勝利屬夏光與兩江乙</h3>
<p>球藝相等、軒輊難分之兩江與東南之女籃球戰、在最後之八分鐘内、東南因陣線慌亂、以三十三比三十八惜敗、四十分鐘之形勢、無時無刻不使人提心吊胆、血脈緊張、比數互前互後、常在水平線上、當第三節終了時、尚爲二十七比二十七之平手、勝負之判分、全在最後之一節、至於雙方表演、均已登峯造極、美妙無比、可惜東南以最後之慌張而敗、中華籃球房中、觀者七八百人、無不高擊喝手、兩江前鋒陳榮明之身手、不讓鬚眉男子、動作輕脫、氣力雄壯、善於遠擲實兩江之功臣、後衛陳白雪、矮小精悍、防禦嚴密、厥功亦不可沒、東南前役平均、惟因後衛劉逸軒三次侵人犯規退塲失此大將、後方頓無聯絡、遵被兩江建最後之勝利、總之、兩隊表演、均盡顯高超藝術、勝者敗、均有榮焉、</p>
<h3>東南力爭優先</h3>
<p>七時正、兩隊女將、粉墨登場、開始活動、七時半裁判舒鴻執笛動員、雙方列陣佈位、開始厮鬥、兩江矮胖子楊森首開紀錄、歡聲大起、東南極力進攻傳遞優美、孫毓秀還敬一球、兩江楊森罰中、東南章哲君中個一雙、以六比三分佔優、一時聲勢大盛、捧塲者大爲喝手、兩江整頓陣容、以清晰美妙之傳遞、陳榮明加上一球、楊森遠射中的、再來一個、乃以八比六超出東南、緊張聲中、不多時候、東南潘小姐（月英）造成平手（八比八）、於是空氣益爲嚴重、雙方各盡能事、從容迫進、東南深入籃下、兩江嚴密防禦、潘月英無可活動、乃背籃反擲、一舉成功、嘆爲觀止、章哲君繼接得分、又以十二比八、榮領前茅、兩江見勢不佳、力取上游、陳榮明打中籃圈、計時員長鳴警笛、宣告上半時戰局終了、對照紀錄、東南以十二比十佔優、</p>
<h3>兩江力造平手</h3>
<p>再下動令、東南始終佔優、形勢殊佳、兩江努力奮鬥、不稍示弱、但比數並無變化、兩方戒備俱嚴、鮮有建樹、東南潘小姐·章姑娘各得罰球一分、兩江楊森妙中、並無虧本、但潘月英又爲東南加上一分、章哲君横裏抛進、共加三分、分數止於十七、兩江徐圖宏展、節節進攻、陳榮明僅取一分、潘夢兩次打中、造成十七比十七、成上半時之比數、是節中、兩江陳白雪殊爲努力、石黃兩小姐亦勇敢克制、周密非凡、東南之陳雪琴動作敏捷、搶奪利害、劉逸軒王志新則穩健可取、雙方得分、均極㣲少、</p>
<h3>雙方劇戰時間</h3>
<p>濘檬進後、聲勢又趨急昂、浩浩蕩蕩、大家戰得起勁、江灣女將、先聲奪人、潘章兩小姐連中三元、取得吉利以六分遙佔上風、兩江見勢不佳、停戰商議、調換兵丁、大舉反攻二陳一潘、聯合殺進、氣𦦨萬丈、連加九分之多、反以二十六比二十三超勝、於是捧塲者亦因之變更主顧、聲氣益爲雄壯、而表演精彩、亦繫於此際東南不逼不迫、亡命厮殺、孫小姐加上四分、對方由陳榮明罰得一分、第三節結束、比數爲二十七比二十七、觀此情形、雙方之勝負、實不使在技術上判分、祇有幸運可解决、且看最後之一幕、</p>
<h3>東南不幸慘敗</h3>
<p>最後一節、爲生死關頭、雙方無不加倍努力、但東南不幸於此時失一大將、卽劉逸軒女士之以三次侵人犯規離場、兩江趁此機會、陳亮才取得二分、但東南再接再厲、不稍示弱、孫小姐罰得一分、潘月英投中一球、比數又以三十比二十九、勝兩江一分、當此時問不多、緊急關頭、兩江陳榮明在場角遠擲幸中、確爲兩江大振軍容、而爲東南喪氣、斯時東南得一罰球機會、如能命中、聲勢或可恢復、無如章小姐謹愼過甚、芳心動搖、因而失機、從此兩江浩浩蕩、銳氣旺盛、近投遠擲、連連打中、東南陣容、益爲慌張、加以求勝心切、管束力頓然消失、慘敗之聲、乃隨銀笛而起、兩江以三十八比三十三、反敗爲勝、亦云幸矣、</p>

<h3>賑災舞弊鉅案續審記楊樹誠全紹武等被告均到合同與麥化粉已研訊明白</h3>
<p>丨全紹武對被控七欵亦逐項答辯丨</p>
<h3>許世英發表對控案意見</h3>
<p>皖北賑濟舞弊鉅案、自本月二十一日經第一特區地方法院公開審理後、各界人士、益形注意、昨日下午、爲該案繼續審訊之期、到庭旁聽者、更覺擁擠、幾至座無𨻶地、二時半、原告安徽旅滬同鄕會代表李振亞·陸車五·洪鼎·王竹如·胡佩如、被告國府水災會職員楊樹誠·全紹武·查良釗·及原告律師李時蕊·陳忠蔭·被告律師江一平·章行嚴·等、相繼到庭、俄而承審推事吳廷琪與書記官升座、當由李律師起立聲稱、本案情形、異常複雜、一時殊難明瞭、最好請先傳派往皖北調查之調查員到案訊問、則自易了解、安徽旅滬同鄕會自接調查員報告、曾致函水災會詢問補救辦法、嗣因水災會之答復、毫無要領、方進行訴訟云云、被告查良釗等三律師乃一致表示反對先傳調查員訊問、謂應先就原告所控欵、逐一審查、致調查員之報告、祇能作爲參考而已</p>
<p>就職日期問題　吳推事因楊樹誠被控部份、前次尚未審究完竣、遂繼續向原告李振亞問曰、原狀稱楊樹誠係一月十五日就運輸專員職務、而楊提出電報稿底、證明爲一月二十四日以前、實不負運輸責任、此問題究竟如何、可稱但楊前與調查員談話、則云一月十五日就職、載在調查員報告書、今所爭僅十天時期、但十天外楊總須負責、</p>
<p>運麥公司誤傳　吳推事又向李訊問楊樹誠託義興公司運麥事、李稱此係向津浦路局及運輸業方面調查所得、楊於一月十八日起、由津浦鐵路運往蚌埠小麥三千噸、係託華豐公司轉運、狀内誤爲義興、在彼就運輸專員前後時期、賑麥並未裝運、此係事實、無可諱言、基其阻運賑麥、致皖北災民餓斃甚夥、</p>
<p>不訴貝克原因　吳推事又訊之曰、楊樹誠旣係協助辦理運輸、則尚另有主持之人、何故獨咎被告、李稱、運輸處職、實係共同作弊、然楊不能以僅控彼一人、即藉此推諉、吳惟事又曰、運輸處長美人貝克、前次已言楊樹誠無權阻運賑麥、李稱本欲連貝克一併起訴、徒以其係外人、不受我國法院管轄耳、</p>
<p>三次購麥經過　庭上遂轉訊楊樹誠向水災會購麥情形、據楊供稱前後共購三次、第一次時在本年二月二十左右、數爲千噸、其價每噸三兩九錢、未訂合同、該麥已由水災會運存蚌埠、故係在蚌交貨、第二次約在三月二十外購九百噸、價爲三兩七錢、亦無合同、第三次爲三月二十二日、購九千噸、價與第二次相同、此次訂有合同、水災會由副委員長辛博森簽字、而貝克與查良釗、則居證人地位簽字、惟第二第三兩次之麥、雖皆在浦口購就、但由水災會運到蚌埠交貨、運費完全豁免云云、</p>
<p>出售賑麥原因　質之被告查良釗供、彼與貝克之簽字、並不負任何責任、僅僅證明此事而已、並將辛博森新近致彼之信呈案、謂水災會出售賑麥、係欲亟需現欵、且已得美政府許可、辛氏函内、言之綦詳、應請察閱、此時原告律師提出草稿三紙、謂此係水災會售麥與楊之合同底稿、經皖同鄕向水災會抄錄而得者此份合同察其署名之次序、足見查良釗與貝克均南負責任、被楊樹誠供、祇有一次訂合同、焉則其餘二合同稿從何而來耶、</p>
<p>合同確祇一份　查聞語即加辯白、謂合　確祇一份、第一第二兩次售麥、並未訂有合同、僅記其事於備忘錄、我以職務關係、故應在備忘錄簽字、此次安徽同鄕會向水災會抄錄合同底稿、竟連備忘錄亦併抄錄、今乃誤認合同云云、江一平律師復爲補充意見、謂合同須雙方簽字、第一第二兩紙、並無楊樹誠簽字、顯見絕非合同、吳推事遂諭李振亞謂審核證供關於售麥一點、實係水災會主張、虧損與否、與他方無涉、</p>
<p>涉及賑會全體　李答稱關於此問題、未起訴之先、曾愼重考慮、深覺水災會應負責任者、實惟原告不欲擴大範圍、故未一一控告、江律師因李所言、涉及水災會全體、頗咎其發言不愼、謂本案中外注目、而原告僅憑一紙調查報告、遽提起刑事自訴、要知刑事訟案、應以直接發見證據爲原則、故原告須確切證明、不能籠統其詞、任意指摘、</p>
<p>麥化粉之研訊　吳推事以控楊各欵中、尚剩將麥化爚一欵、猶未詢及、遂即楊審究該欵情形、據楊稱、因正陽關一帶災民、不喜麥而需粉、故由水災會駐蚌之西人、將麥向我所設之寳興麵粉廠易粉每百斤之麥、易粉八十斤、有該西人之信、堪以證明、原告李振亞駁之、謂其時災民已將樹皮草根充饑、賑之以麥、味同珍饈、斷不致得隴望蜀、却麥而需粉、被告所呈之信、爲其同一機關辦事者所出、殊不足信、原告律師、並將皖省府關於將麥化粉之公函提出、謂觀此即可明瞭一切也、</p>
<p>全紹武之部分　訊至此、庭上宣稱、楊樹誠被訴各欵、大體已審查　事、茲須訊問第二被告全紹武被控各欵、當命李振亞將訴全紹武停放賑糧尅扣賑欵等七項、逐一陳述後、並命全紹武逐欵答辯、全對第一欵停放五河縣賑糧事件、謂因該縣於五月二十四五發生毆打放賑人員風潮、彼時在蚌聞耗去電、雖有暫停兩字、但事實並未停賑等語、雙方互有陳述、並各提出證據、直至五時、問官遂宣諭退庭、改期十二月六日午後續訊、</p>
<p>許世英昨返滬　國府賑務委員會主席許靜仁氏、前因其封翁在秋浦原籍病故、特請假旋里奔喪、現因公務叢脞、特提早銷假來滬、於昨日中午十二時乘輪抵埠、稍事休息後、即赴仁濟堂賑委會辦事處批閱公文、華東社記者昨該許氏叩以此次水災會職員無弊涉訟案眞相、據許氏云、此事發生後、内幕究竟如何、本人毫不知悉、同鄕會之控告、因爲該會常委、故照章將余名列入、事先亦未與聞、况余身任水災會常委、如知悉職員有舞弊情形、自當按照行政處分處理、或請宋委員長查辦、固無庸具名控告、又水災會係分組辦事、此事係屬於災區工作組範圍、余雖任席常委、僅出席會議數次、故此事内容、毫不知悉、殊難臆斷是非、故無論此案如何進行、本人决不願與聞、况余已登報聲明、未參與列名控訴、法院亦不致要余到庭作證也、又許氏定明日乘夜車赴京、出席三省義振會、即行乘江新輪赴漢謁蔣云、</p>

<p>九三老人馬相伯語錄</p>
<h3>人生的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 景紀</p>
<p>試思生之謎，如何解答？</p>
<p>人生、世：螞蟻做窩，忙個不了：又爲什麽？</p>
<p>人有良心：有靈魂麽？難道所謂善惡功過沒有賞罰！</p>
<p>你得想想：有灌音機，你的音容色笑，都有法子保存。</p>
<p>你再想想：有攝影術，一舉動，也都可以像鏡中留㾗了。</p>
<p>那麽，我得追問：精神的現象，超人的活動，又將何如？</p>
<p>我們根據科學求進步的觀念，滿可以設想：在冥冥中，已經有一種特别的設備，將人生的功過善惡，滿都紀錄好了！</p>
<p>你在大衆前，不敢作醜事。暗地去做，或者想做：自以爲沒有能察覺的。如果有被察覺的可能，必定害羞，就不敢作。現在你旣然明瞭，有一種特别的設備，專管理良心的問題，將你的秘密活動，心思心念，一切一切，部都留了影，灌了聲：那麽，你爲何不自省自修，向光明的大道上前進呢？</p>
<p>十目所視，十手所指：莫見乎隱，莫顯乎㣲：非體物不可遺之造物而何？有此愼戒··慝雖至細，斷以弗爲：不敢獲罪於天！</p>
<p>古希臘大哲人，先講認識自已。士林哲學，敎人自謙：學間淵博，自知「全無」··對越造手主，自訟而自承··「我於爾至尊之前，伏俯我於全無之内！」然後始能成功偉大的人！</p>
<p>如果世人知道，百歲前後無我：我之爲我，作何歸宿？</p>
<p>何人送戰袍</p>
<h3>丨我要問一問你們丨</h3>
<p>— 程魯丁</p>
<p>山海關外，一個沉沉的夜，蕭蕭，白楊聲避悲笳動：凄凄，黃十叢中野鬼呌：迷烟夢一般的，墳頭，隴頭，荒草荒原，幻滅的，死亡的，黑壓壓的是什麽？是死神，是魔鬼，也伸出了巨靈的手掌了！鷓鴣跳夜鷹嘯；村落，河流，竹舍，農田，破碎了的山河喲，永遠不再了吧？不，在那裏有星星的火花，是生命之火在燃燒，又是爆發了的火花！</p>
<p>力的追求者，血的清算者，他們這一羣，呻吟着的時代，憔悴了的中國，有這樣的一羣嗎？可是火花已經跳躍在眼前，他們敲起了血鐘了。</p>
<p>月，朦朧的，掛在天上，天上，有雲的尾巴，有星的眼睛，風吹，吹不寒他們的胆，吹不冷他們的血，蘆草好像一支殘笛，落葉好像一張破琴，雁子在歌唱，縱然昌一闋古情的怨歌行，這些嗎，也打不動他們化石似的心。</p>
<p>夜長，何曾入夢，地上出舖上了銀色的雪，神經，血管，都播下了犠牲的種子，他們的心上揷上了一面抵抗的大旗！轟，轟，砲在吼，拍，拍，槍在呌，紫色的烟，紅色的花，血也似的火光，包圍着他們，就死，算得什麽呢？光榮的死，勝利的死，固然是造成了一座神聖的祭台！可是未死的，還在戰，也就是中國的一座萬里鐵城。飲露，呑雪，這是他們的生活啊！浴血，含淚，這是他們的敎育啊！可是現在天冷了，努力送戰袍！這也是我們應該的責任吧！那末·究竟何人送戰袍呢？我要問一問諸君！</p>
<p>旗鞋之建議</p>
<h3>丨杜漏巵，合衛生，宜審美丨</h3>
<p>— 陶在東</p>
<p>高跟皮鞋，價數元乃至數十元，有人統計，月輸出百萬元以上，則年漏巵千二百萬餘元，數巨可驚：遂有高呼打倒皮鞋之口號，似此風氣已成，豈口號所能打倒？計莫如　國貨代替之·故有旗鞋之建議。</p>
<p>旗鞋與旗袍，本八旗締女之裝束，今旗袍則盛行矣，凡　　　　　，袍而不鞋，是學得一半，豈非遺憾！挡旗鞋之美在鞋底，上平而下銳，作橢圓形或盃口式，其高度一寸以來，高在足心，與高之在後跟者，其功用等無有異。</p>
<p>原婦女之好高跟皮鞋，非喜其皮，實以高跟合於愛美之心理耳。蓋美人之身段宜長，高跟則增其長：美人之姿勢宜峭，高跟則助其峭：長則苗條，峭則俊秀，此其優點，旗鞋固均有之，其高度在中部，軒輊尤爲有致，其立亭亭，其行欵欵，梁壽之步折腰，飛燕之形花顫：將離忽合，似往若還，其美在神，高跟不能也。試觀探母劇中之公主，名伶如海蘭芳輩取之，能謂非美乎？且高跟放踵挫趾，拘攣筋血，極不衛生，無異纏足弓鞋，而旗鞋則無此病，不僅此也。</p>
<p>錦繡金玉，美人之副品，猶名將之馬，俠士之劍也。乃珠光寳氣，全體莊嚴，獨至於足，則限制於皮革，頓形减色。若旗鞋者，不獨鞋之本身，翻新花樣，並可綴以東珠，嵌以鑽石，奇珍異寳，儘量加飾，斯盡美盡善矣。然猶有進，臣嘗見八旗貴族婦女，將鞋底鏤空，作如意式·八結式·花瓣式·中實以紫白色香粉，行步輒印於地衣毡毹，可謂艶跡。又嘗見於底面，嵌入小錶，低頭以審時刻，由今爲之，更可安無線電矣。又嘗憶德菱女士清宮日記，初改旗裝不便，久之舒服，盛稱項巾與旗鞋之姿美，此又有人實騐也。</p>
<p>總之以旗鞋代替皮鞋，衛生審美，挽回利權，在一舉足間，我諸姑姊妹·豈有意乎？尤望名媛閨秀，交際明星，以身作則，毅然提倡，則此議爲不虚矣。臣在東誠欣誠忭，稽首頓首昧死言。</p>
<h3>學校趣屑</h3>
<p>— 笠</p>
<p>㈠敎室裏香臭互鬭</p>
<p>假如這敎室裏多着幾位密斯的話，上半日第一課中，可儘你聞夠那啥啥霜的香味。可是第三課開始時，伊們個個的豐圓的屁股上，却帶來了團團的馬桶臭，敎室裏一時香臭互鬭，那種氣味，眞要呌你連呼聞不得也哉。</p>
<p>㈡常吃閉門羹</p>
<p>郵差送到門房裏的信札，要算女生最歡喜捷足翻看。常時有些頑皮的男生，給伊們輕輕在裏面把門　上，於是一時好像金絲籠裏閉着的嬌鶑，亂跳亂呌，大吃閉門羹而後已。</p>
<p>㈢公平之賊</p>
<p>在我們實騐的小學裏，有一副灶，三隻鍋子，各樣應用的東西都全。目前我們祇須一隻鍋，用已夠事。不料一天夜裏一，個賊挖洞進來偷去了一隻大鍋一隻小鍋，和鍋蓋等物，還留着一個完全的大鍋，給我們燒水洗面。彼取所需，我棄不需，倒是深懂做賊的「做學敎」公平之賊的道理。</p>
<h3>滑稽之結晶品</h3>
<p>— 卓弗靈</p>
<p>余嘗謂··滑稽滑稽，談何容易，人皆以爲不合情理，卽爲滑稽；引人發笑，亦是滑稽。其實不然。所謂滑稽者，須於突梯之中，含有至理，而且趣味深長，令人深印腦中，永不能忘，始爲滑稽之上乘者。劉春山，滬上著名之滑稽朋友也。其談吐，雖似瞎三話四，僅足供人一笑；然細味其意，大有嚼橄欖之妙。今劉君以言語歌唱，尚不能盡其長，乃攝製一滑稽影片，曰「雞鴨夫妻，長約一萬尺，内容不僅足以令人噴飯，且可噴點心，噴牛奶·其中角色，除劉君爲主角外，他如錢無量，丁怪怪，趙希希，盛呆呆，陸希希，陸奇奇，江笑笑，鮑樂樂等，凡滬上之著名滑稽人材，無不搜羅在内云。</p>
<p>短訊張秋蟲主編之萬歲雜誌半月刋，内容豐富·名作如林。現屆第八期出版，因有讀者奪標會揭曉·又復增加名作·是以出版之日，略有延遲，本期要目：有「江山萬里圖」，「做官秘訣」·「海上靑樓沿革記」·「超人與非人下篇」，「天花亂　」等等數十篇。無一非精心結搆之傑作。凡在十一月底前直接訂閱者，仍照優待辦法收費云。</p>
<h3>死之岔道㈡㈩㈤</h3>
<p>— 范烟</p>
<p>七、這個心還是你的</p>
<p>××路軍退第二道防線，是證實了。但是還有幾個下級軍官，留在上海，秘密工作。翠㣲村的劉阿根已從士兵的劉根生逐步上升，在抵抗日本兵的時候，已做了連副的劉更生了。他也被派在上海做秘密的工作。這天到東南飯店找連長，沒有碰見退出來，正想搭着電梯下去見電梯口立着一個女人。本來上海的女人，不過裝飾得人時些，沒有什麽旁的可注意處，並且在旅館裏電梯口，一天到晚，不知道有多少人時的女人來往着，曾在火線上，和世界上第一等野蠻兵肉搏過的劉更生，更不在心上，他以爲多對着女人看，足以减少英雄氣的，雖是本路軍的同志，都喜歡和女同志一起玩，調節他們工作的疲勞，但是，他决不願意一個女人隨着死生未卜的軍人投機，也不願意『匈奴未滅』時的軍人，給一個女人羈絆着，依戀着，所以這幾年從江西，安徽，江蘇，浙江，再從浙江到江蘇，不安定的轉走中，早把愛姑忘記得一乾二凈了。他雖和愛姑有好多年不見，那愛姑給太陽晒得醬油似的手的黑，沒有功夫去粉飾而有天然美的頸項的白，永遠存在着隨時可以廻想得到的，立在面前的那女人，當然和愛姑兩樣，無論如何變得快，愛姑决不會變成這樣的一個的，這是無庸多疑的，所能使他略略頓逗着的，那女人的眼風狠流動，而有一種勢力，因此他也就在等電梯無聊梯還不來。</p>
<p>那女人也有些不耐了，伸手去撳鐵欄邊上的電鈴鈕，縮還來，順便向額上一撩，把蜷曲的斜覆在左額的秀髮，撥開一點，那燙髮，給電氣熨斗蜷得『不侵不胖』了，等伊的手放下，依舊還到原地，像墨筆畫着一個不端整的圓圈似的，覆在左額上，但是這一下，撥動了劉更生的心弦，鏗的響起來了，怦的跳起來了，自已對自已忖度問答：</p>
<p>『咦！也有一個瘢的，也是在左額；······天下儘有面貌相同的，在私塾裏聽馮先生講過，孔子就和陽貨的面貌相的；······不：沒有這們相像的，越看越像了，眉毛細得多了，看不出了，眼風是不會變動的，不過比以前更流動些：······哎！眞的以爲是愛姑麽？用得着說「以前！」······」</p>

<h3>金融市昨極平淡</h3>
<p>昨晨洋交市面、本已懈怠、惟人心方面、以前日餘波未息故氣象尚在堅挺中、究其實際、遠不逮前數日之旺、卒至午市步步軟落形勢亦頗平淡、銀收解亦非常清閑耳、</p>
<p>（厘拆價格）「洋厘」早市爲七錢一分四厘、較前午又高二毫半、午市忽跌八七五爲七錢一分三厘一毫二忽半、結果較前午反小六毫二忽半、「銀拆」較爲緊挺、早午兩市同爲五分、較前日改好二分、劃頭加水初爲白劃、最後則爲三四分</p>

<p>丨其他趨勢極混亂丨</p>
<p>昨（二十五日）華商證券交易所期市大致仍佳、前後市人氣頗旺、債價則以迫近交割、而價已上漲頗高、是以各價隨市塲一時之求供情况以爲轉移、各盤此漲彼跌、殊屬混亂、蓋大户觀望、市塲交易以掉期爲多、未有鉅額新買賣也、其中整六因在市上需要較旺、而賣出特稀、最稱堅挺、比前日又漲高八九角、裁兵曾一度爲賣出交易踴躍、比前日下降一元許、計跌至五十五元左右、惟收市復轉堅勢、其他則漲落不定、結果比前日互有漲跌、爲數僅在三四角左右、而察諸收市時之趨勢、似市價暫仍不致返低云、計全日現貨交易二萬五千元、期貨上午約四百四十萬元、後市三百六十餘萬、合計八百零六萬元、</p>

<h3>糧食米市形勢平穩</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源四十餘號、因天雨關係、顧客稀少、早晚稻頂定次軟角許、常錫北粳及蘇同帮價與前盤相仿、變元酒户略有、形硬一角、蘆洋尖無榮辱、</p>
<p>（新閘）明日西路來源四五十號、因小雨連綿、早晨臨市人數不多、厚粳開盤硬起五分、薄早二稻到旺销淡、價格見鬆、蘆尖·洋尖·杜尖·客尖四種各低一角、河下斛開二千石之譜、</p>
<p>閩帮暢辦客秈</p>
<h3>丨泉省兩帮胃口極濃丨</h3>
<p>昨日米市况、完全停頓、行家自已配客亦少、高西貢一號米只配八元三角半、陳西貢進户吃價只有七元九角半、市面呆疲、已達極點、須有大帮去化、方有轉機之望、但市上存底尚有六十多萬包、形勢終無佳况也、</p>
<p>昨日客秈市况、頗形活潑、因閩帮之泉州與省帮胃口均濃、省帮本有鉅大胃口、因避免别帮爭辦、曾一度停頓、昨日辦興突暢、與泉州厦門天津烟台各帮爭辦、市價疲而復振、計售開湖南機油米二千二百包、價八元九角半、八元八角、次至八元六角二分、又機紅米八百包、價八元至七元九角、江西機元一百八十三包、價九元半、又蕪湖機元、昨日續到高格貨一百四十七包、售開八十四包、價十元零七角半、多數爲福州辦去、北帮與泉州祇辦去機油各數百包云、</p>
<h3>標粉略呈俏勢</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、呈初平繼穩之象、以洋麥報價、祇坎麥小八分左右、美麥休息無市、開盤時、各月份均見平平、因買賣雙方、交易甚少、惟後因抛户甚少、人心似趨堅穩、結果較好五厘左右、迨至下午開盤、交易異常稀淡、空拍不少、因廠方大致觀望、無意民檔客帮則略有需要、因此市氣㣲呈俏勢、照此情形、後步當暫呈盤旋也、結果十一十二月份較前日好七厘半、一月份好一分半、二月份好七厘半、三四月份好一分云、</p>
<h3>期麥交淡價無上落</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各月份市面、仍見寂寞之態、遠期各月份、因多空交易、仍然稀少、進出不暢、價亦無上落、因籌碼甚薄、大有賣難買亦難之勢、至本月份因交割已近、數雖不多、惟現貨到期甚乏、人心尚穩、收盤結果、較幾日前、似好一二分云、</p>
<h3>芝加哥小麥轉疲</h3>

<p>糖市粗砂白市挺銷稀</p>
<h3>丨新靑糖亦見疲滯丨</h3>
<p>昨日糖市以標金一度到過七百七十兩、市勢轉升、公會劃盤如二十四號粗砂白普通貨劃十五兩零五分成交祇有數百包、高貨計十五兩二錢、殊少問津良以實銷仍未暢達故耳、十八號中砂喊十五兩一錢、二十號中砂喊十五十四錢、皆無做出八號荷赤新貨十一兩四錢、老貨十一兩二錢五分、九號荷赤新货十一兩六錢、老貨十一兩三錢五分、受手亦屬不多新靑糖如黃崮靑續開九兩二錢因貨平常、成交依然寥寥、後市仍看軟勢、建冰如五福白冰以成本增高貨主來電囑扳、但號方鍳於申銷未暢、加亦難能、故連日零星售出、仍是原盤云、</p>
<h3>南北貨津紅棗銷活市穩</h3>
<p>天津紅棗、近以來源無多、而申銷尚活、故市勢挺秀、昨由怡和公司定生輪運到一批、計二千餘包開出、如頭户十七兩至十四兩、二户十兩至九兩、三户八兩至七兩、惟據津函訊、地頭尚存有二萬包之譜、故後貨如不湧到、可望穩立云、</p>
<p>絲茶無錫白廠經續有運滬</p>
<h3>丨昨由滬寗貨車裝到七十四件丨</h3>
<p>無錫各絲廠、復工以來、絲產日增、而歐銷不起、各廠存絲充厚、茲以月底轉瞬卽屆、各廠商間有承抛各洋行十一月份期絲者、理宜依期交解、故現絲續有運滬、昨滬寗貨車由錫裝到白廠經七十四件云、</p>
<p>白絲頭綢銷益滯</p>
<h3>丨棉織品銷路暢達絹絲廠停工日增丨</h3>
<p>自新式絲綢盛行以來、白絲頭如長吐·短吐·繭衣·湯繭等綢門需要激增、用以織製綈葛等品、茲以冬令已屆、棉織品上市、新式絲綢銷數一落千丈、存貨山積、無人問訊白絲頭綢銷益滯、滬埠長吐繭衣等歐銷又無起色、輪出寥落、絲頭市面一時無轉機望云、</p>
<h3>兩湖紅茶慘跌</h3>
<p>漢口消息云、邇來漢市兩湖紅茶市面、殆呈一蹶不振之狀、英國銷路、旣受印度茶之廉價競銷影響、而英政府又復重徵華茶人口稅率、英銷幾於完全停滯、在漢辦茶之俄國恊助會、雖有相當口胃、但該行又係有組織的機關始終抱定非廉不購宗旨、因之兩湖紅茶市價、已由三四十兩、暴跌至十二三兩、華茶商所受痛苦、至爲鉅大</p>
<h3>疋頭麥爾登走勢活俏</h3>
<p>昨日呢羢交易、尚稱暢旺、麥爾登趨勢甚爲俏活、蓋自天津杭州大批辦去後、申地存貨見缺、市面步見進展、目下天氣轉寒、本街實銷已動、洋服裁縫舗需要驟殷元常顏色均俏、售價比上週好起數分銀子、昨寗豐大石江、已喊售一兩八錢七分五厘矣、</p>
<h3>油市柏油產新後的形勢</h3>
<p>丨初期產額未旺丨</p>
<p>丨補充交易尚繁丨</p>
<p>柏油新油、各產地均已登場、惟初出產之時、未見大旺、而需者均欲稍辦、以充底積、故交易頗不岑寂、本埠皂廠家、亦有辦過、聞價格在十五兩三四錢、送廠磅見、惟此價太覺低廉、故售者甚少、因漢市麻城油仍在十二兩七八錢、以此計算、殊難獲利、恐後交無人繼續出、至於燭淘銷場、仍屬清淡、雖因出新之際、爲淘家備底之時、然以往年而衡、亦有盛衰之别、乃連日漢函所詳、麻城油新貨續有見到、祇數未多、故未開盤、據大約與陳油不相上下、聞荆宜一帶年令暢豐、故將來出數或較前上兩年爲旺、且各產區匪患旣已敉平、商業雖一時不能卽復舊觀、然亦可得次第恢復、農民旣能安居、農產物亦得縱容收穫、面柏子總不若往年之無人採摘、任其謝落、預計產數、决可增加、惟浙省年令、互有豐欠、大約金華蘭溪一帶較歉、嘉興一帶較豐、故紹興各榨油坊、均在浙西方面採辦柏子、乃浙油之疲而復振、職是故耳、本埠行家存積薄甚、因銷場未旺、故不願多備、祇隨進隨出耳、</p>
<h3>煤炭廠用煤交易减少</h3>
<p>日來本埠絲廠大多停工、因而煤斤用度減少、市場烟煤統屑各貨交易、頓形減色、盤價又呈不穩、昨日售開之魯煤博山統、每噸祇九兩五錢、悅昇統十兩、　汪統七兩、中興屑十兩、</p>
<h3>五金馬口鐵美貨步俏</h3>
<p>萎靡多日之美馬口鐵、昨趨况頓形樂觀、標準因靑黃不替、高起數錢、計九十磅估十四兩七錢半、一百磅十五兩七錢半、二百磅三十兩、聞連日購者甚多、市况甚許樂觀也云、</p>

<h3>畸形崇拜</h3>
<p>— 天方</p>
<p>崇拜他體，不論是具體的行爲，或抽象的哲理，這原是一種向上的心理，但畸形的崇拜，却是一種病態，這病態，在我中國，丨不在東方民族間吧，充分地表現着，</p>
<p>所謂崇拜心，原是由感於外體而生的内心的反應，大要在於「見賢思齊」道一意羲上，但我們的民族眞是本安分，太知足了，多半是「見賢而不知思齊」，只重於「外察」而忽於「内省」，希望他人來演活劇，自已躱在旁邊瞧熱鬧，坐享其成，在思慮中間，只看到一他人」而把「我」的觀念忘了，所以造成了一種僥倖幻想的人生觀，糊裏湖塗的生活着，</p>
<p>舉例不在遠，我們且先從原始的信仰丨神說起吧，在西洋的神話傳說中的主角，都是健全的，美麗的，而在中國的神话傳說中的主人翁，不是像濟顚的瘋顚，便是像鐵拐李的拐脚，多是醜惡</p>
<p>孤哀子泣血稽　泣損首　　稽首　稽首不孝等不自殞滅禍延顯苫塊昏迷語無倫次叨在戚世鄕友聞誼該蒙矜恤哀此訃訃告同人　　親視含殮遵禮成服謹擇日害奠日領　　訃未周</p>
<p>的，不近人情的，講到治國的人材，那未，我們願有一個萬能的眞主在我們頭上，給我們欣賞贊嘆，讓他來統治一切，我們願叨他的福分，來安居樂業，我們從沒有做過四萬萬人大家起來做皇帝的夢，總之，我們願意有一個萬能的人來包辦一切，而不願意人人具有一技一能來分擔工作，這说上不自省不知思齊的緣故，但萬能的人，終不可得，所以夢想也終於夢想，</p>
<p>復次，談到體育，丨這篇文字，原因感到現在體育界的畸形發展而寫的，丨那末，我們只願意有一二李惠堂戴麟經邱飛海林寳華已足，丨我當然無菲薄諸君球藝的意思，丨而不想普逼的訓練民衆，現在體育的興味，還只推行到學校，而學校又只注重一二特出人才的造就，丨此等學隆在學校中非常優待丨而不注意一般水準的提高，在這廣大的羣衆中，加以培植，豈沒有一二李惠堂林寳華之流，然而是埋沒了，這實在與提倡體育的意義相差太遠，歸根說起來，也是中了畸形崇拜的毒，要知現在是集團化的時代　我們要打破　能思想　打破英雄主義，我們不　上　的　，　　　走沙石的路，我們要求一般　的　　不想一二的飛躍·一切都這樣，不止　體育，</p>

<h3>飢民謠</h3>
<p>— 孫籌成</p>
<p>昨晤竹民先生，出示渠所撰之「訊民謠」三首，捧誦一過，不禁涙下，爰特照錄以實本刋，希望本埠豐衣足食之同胞，閱後慨發慈悲，節衣縮食以救濟此無告之飢民，</p>
<p>大雪滿荒甸，鳥鳴何所戀，雄飛覔枝棲不定，雌飛覓食粒不見，村中老翁呼老伴，遣兒尋柴炊晨膳，箱中豆麥已無羨，還防官軍索米麵，</p>
<p>北風颶颺徹骨寒，草棚欹斜千百間，哀鴻嗷嗷無處訴，田莊咫尺何日還，屋雖燬兮田雖荒，還家尚有窖存糧，官軍養賊不肯戰，忍飢忍凍空惆悵，</p>
<p>鬻兒鬻不去，鬻女無人顧，亦非無人顧，官家嚴禁制，死塡溝壑飽豺狼，老者已矣少堪傷，吾儕何辜遭此殃，天下何事多戰塲，</p>

<h3>滅火藥水與禦火衣的製法</h3>
<p>— 顧學裘</p>
<p>都市居屋櫛次麟比比，一朝失愼，殃及百家，故偶遭火災，相隣之居屋，必危險萬分，因此家庭之中須有防火之設備，以免將來不時之需，滅火藥水與禦火衣二物，製造便利，有價值低廉，故介紹於后，家庭中可信而行之。</p>
<h3>滅火藥水</h3>
<p>原料··硼砂　一百二十分　無水炭酸鈉　二百分　苛性鈉　三百分　炭酸阿馬尼亞　四百分　清水　二百分</p>
<p>滅火藥水之製造極易，只消以各料入清水攪和，藏入玻璃瓶中，用軟木塞塞住瓶口，如遇火患，或連瓶投入火中而破碎之，或去塞，將液向火中灑去，火着澆水即滅，誠爲救火之第一妙品，家居宜貯藏多瓶以，行方便，</p>
<h3>禦火衣</h3>
<p>我們知道，衣服祇有禦雨而無禦火之功，尋常穿了雨衣，可以不怕雨水的侵襲，但是無論那件前服，遇到了火燄的時候，沒有不立即燃燒的，現在有一個方法，就是反尋常的衣料製造一種禦火的衣料，把牠做成衣服，穿在身上，即使在融融大火之中，出入可無焚身之虞子丨這個方法在我們的試騐室内，試騐過幾此，已得到相當的成績，故不敢自秘，介紹於讀者之前，</p>
<p>原料　尋常衣料，錫酸鈉（ＳodiumStannate）其濃度約三鎊溶入一加崙水中，硫酸錏（ＡmmonianＳulfate）濃度約一鎊半溶入一加倫水中</p>
<p>製法　將尋常之衣料，浸入錫酸鈉之溶液中，浸透後露乾，不可晒日光，再將其浸入硫酸錏之溶液中，浸透後露乾，再將衣料在水中洗之數次，然後晒乾即成，因此法製成之禦火衣，雖經過二十次的洗濯，其禦火的功效仍在，</p>
<p>解頣爲題</p>
<h3>全是假定</h3>
<p>— 文炳</p>
<p>有引丨近竟有一種報出起「假定」專刋來了，可見得那確是個很巧妙的標題。這年頭，無論是個人或社會，無論是國家或世界，都像大海中的船，遇了逆風似的不順暢；爲的是經濟恐慌之潮，由西洋盪到東洋，由東洋盪進我們的内河，於是社會在動，人在狂呌，在在題示這世間的缺陷，人生的苦痛·但，我們如把事實「假定」一下，那也就好了·這兒我所說的，也許頗有道理，也許全是胡謅瞎說，但「解頣」我想總會談得上，故以「解頣」爲題。</p>
<p>假定中國人把家族觀念化成民族意識，我想中華民族，决不會如此渙散，大家反民族榮辱丟在腦後。</p>
<p>假定中國人反壞的惡習，除去凈盡，而又刻意地學取外人的長處，我想决不會老被外人輕視··「中國人到底是中國！」</p>
<p>假定人能撇開「物慾」，而不孜於名利，我想他定能胸曠神怡，沒有煩悶。</p>
<p>假定女人不那樣裝嬌撤癡，顯出自已也同是社會上一個人，我想男子也决不敢隨意地把伊們蹂躙，或視爲玩物。</p>
<p>假定我的生活稍有保障，我也决不投靠賣文。</p>
<p>假定帝國主義不如此恣意侵略我國，我想我們的民族國家，决不會如此震撼，這般混亂。</p>
<p>假定我國自已爭氣，二十一年來好好地依照法制做去，而不萁荳相煎，我想外侮决不令那麽紛至沓來。</p>
<p>假定張學良死力抵抗，中央又不一味仰鼻息於國聯，我想東北决不會失之於前，更不會讓它一直失下去。</p>
<p>假定全國的軍隊都如十九路軍的奮勇，我想一二八滬變，我軍何至撤退，而國聯態度，也定會根本的轉變。</p>
<p>假定軍閥不那麽横征暴歛，我想草野小民也會比較的安定，土匪也不會那麽雲湧蠭起。</p>
<p>假定資本主義的經濟結構，沒有矛盾，「生產」能照應到「消費」，社會上沒有物質的浪費，我想全世界决不會這樣的經濟恐慌。</p>
<p>假定人類的資財不那樣資本化，貧富平均，大家有飯吃，我想社會上罪惡的事情，决不會那麽發生的多。</p>
<p>假定帝國主義稍自覺悟，而不窮凶極惡的掠奪弱小民族，我想人間也可減少一些紛擾丨弱小民族的呼聲，自决，反抗。</p>
<p>假定國聯不是分贓機關，秉公處奪國際問題，我想倭奴之强奪我東北，也得迅速拏出一個有效的制裁辦法。</p>
<p>這題目，簡直有話說不盡，爲了本刋的篇幅寳貴，只得用勁把它「拖住」．</p>
<h3>一個寡婦的結局</h3>
<p>— 允宗</p>
<p>根生娘娘自從她丈夫在那年到上海作工從三層樓上跌下來一命嗚呼之後，只有一個五歲兒子榮祥做她唯一的伴侣。她種着二三畝租田，勤工省用，娘囝倆也總算將就得過。</p>
<p>可是有一件事　　她傷心，就是每逢午夜夢回，總覺形單影隻，枕冷衾寒，感到孤寂的苦悶：尤其是碰著人家婚姻大喜，使她觸景生情，幾夜的不得安睡，「枕前涙共階前雨，隔個窗兒滴到明丨」</p>
<p>有時竟想嫁一個漂亮後生，去享受靑春的快樂，可是一念到兒子要做「拖油瓶」，使張家香火斷絕，兒子將來做不起人，又把再嫁的念頭打消了。</p>
<p>一年的夏天，娘娘廟上迎神賽會了，事前她特地買了一段花式洋布，呌三四里外的裁縫李金生做一身短衫褲。金生是個俊俏少年，横掠髮，渾臉兒，唇紅齒白，根生娘娘看見了，不知不覺的和他很親暱丨</p>
<p>一天傍晚，傾盆大雨，下個不停，加以狂風大起，傘也撑不住，金生在她家裏吃了晚飯，不能回家，得了她的允許，就宿在她家裏。啊丨天作之合丨</p>
<p>後來她覺得肚子逐漸高起來，她想到私生子的萬不可留，被人察破後的羞慚，不由得恐怖非常丨百方探得了打胎妙法，勇敢地試行，那知漏血過多，竟抛愛子而長逝了丨唉丨</p>
<h3>重樓隨筆</h3>
<p>— 彭年</p>
<p>（一）死人勿關</p>
<p>在短衣階級隊伍裏，很容易聽到死人勿關一句話；這名話看得到底，寓意非常充足，現在中國的軍閥，不是奉行死人勿關的信條嗎？張學良不抵抗主義，山東韓劉乘國難嚴重時期突起内訌，四川叔姪，鬩牆之爭，這不是不關人民死活的幹嗎？</p>
<p>（二）大廉價的把戲</p>
<p>上海眞可以大廉價，只要你肯把大廉價的招牌掛出：就是價目如故，貨反較劣，一般人終認爲機會，不可失之交臂。我昨天看見報上價目廉得羨慕，想去買點貨物，踏進該店門口，一看價目，一如其舊，了無價廉。而買主只是你搶我奪，爭先恐後，這眞使我莫名其妙，同時，佩服他們大廉價的把戲。</p>
<p>（三）人道主義</p>
<p>昨天在四馬不孝等不自殞路上碰見一位人道主義者，我問他甚麽呌做人道？他說：『不坐人力車的人，就是人道主義。』我想不錯，但看見他的旁邊，有一輛簇新的汽車等待他。於是我双問他；『人道主義，可以坐汽車嗎？』他說：『那有不可以呢！因爲汽車不用人力的。』我被他這樣一答，反正使我沒有話說，後來我想，汽車階級，就是人道主義。</p>
<p>（四）廣告魔力</p>
<p>××書店，出版諸書，素受世人冷眼，銷路不廣。新近登了一張觸目驚心的廣告，立見生效，昔日冷若空房今日門庭如市，經理先生笑容滿面，向顧客道歉不止，店員口中，只聽見『××書容待再版』，而顧客呢！互相爭定·大有恐後　　之概，廣告魔力，眞是偉大。</p>

<p>雛兒</p>
<p>— 一萍</p>
<h3>上海之秘密（二）</h3>
<p>氣候已轉入冬令，望着身上破舊的棉袍，想起這三年來的飄泊生涯。今歳自入秋大病之後，生活更形窘迫。老友徐君，我感謝他的盛意，昨夜有意無意的騙我上跳舞塲，他以爲在這溫存的空氣中，或者可以使我忘却近日的苦痛，但是給與我的影象太壞啊！</p>
<p>我們都不會跳舞，平日談話間，頗以沒有進跳舞塲爲遺憾。昨夜初次駕臨，在Ｂoy的卑視目光中，顯然我們是初進的鄕曲，飲着八毛錢一杯的咖啡，我覺得太不値得，徐君也非富有，我們何必踏進這天堂的地獄！這裏除了以色慾誘人之外，遠不及我們理想中的富於詩意。跳舞在中國，已爲性的賣買的工具。於是秘密之幕在這裏揭開，讀者們，我告訴你一幕喜劇的悲劇：</p>
<p>離我們不遠一盯上，一位商貴的夫人先我們在，她也像我們一樣，並不跳舞，暍着一杯綠色的液體，一雙媚人的秋波，從修長的睫毛中不時向每桌上播送，Ｂoy們却很殷勤的招呼她。後來我意識到她是在注意我們，我招呼徐君還是走罷。那Ｂoy正在這時候，換了一付笑臉過來向徐君耳語，說完話，向高貴夫人那邊以嘴示意。我下意識的瞧去，那夫人恰舉杯齊唇，㣲笑的的身我們點頭。</p>
<p>電燈換了綠光，慄動的音樂和着步伐向中央旋轉，徐君拉了我的手偷着出來，但是那夫人誤會了意思，已緊緊的跟在我們後面：踏下石級，她急趨幾步，拉開停着底汽車的門·很客氣的說：「請上去吧」。</p>
<p>我們不知所措的向前逃，似乎是「雛兒」兩個字，在汽車門砰的關上後送過來。</p>
<p>走完兩條馬路，脚步才和緩下來，我望着身上的破舊棉袍，苦笑着說：「進跳舞塲的代價！」</p>
<p>「雛兒」！徐君細味的吟着。</p>
<h3>石樓漫筆</h3>
<p>— 亢石</p>
<p>世有許多目女子爲禍水的人，偏偏會去接近女子，甚至拜倒石榴裙下，實行釀成禍水。</p>
<p>處在現代的社會，最富有人生哲學，祇要你能夠把每件事細細地推考，就會得到一切的一切丨人生哲學。</p>
<p>女子一個不得意，總是把『死』字放在嘴上，你們可以俯察許多的家庭，發生了一些口角，『死』字就可以從女子的嘴中聆到。</p>
<p>贍養費的名目不除掉，我们曉得女子還在依賴男子的時代，使得增高女子地位，提高女子職業的希望，不能儘量進展。</p>
<p>現代社會，有大多數人死了兒子，　戚得十分沉痛，反之；死了爺娘，却沒有多大悲傷，唉！我眞不　，這大槪是循環的表演吧！</p>
<p>冬天已經到了，一切的補品，又是一般大老官的緊要物，在這要；我們可以明白他們，因爲虚損的緣故，一至了冬天，非大補特補不可，這是俗諺所謂·『富貴多淫慾』的一個證例丨</p>
<p>大凡一件事的錯失，往往起於纖㣲·或者·造成於一霎那間·以致一錯再錯，所以立身非時刻謹愼不可丨</p>
<p>男女間的愛情，雖然歷時久遠，多麽的深厚，可是：有了一些小意見，或者不能諒解，竟參商於片刻，尤其是自由戀愛的男女，這種事情，每天總可在報上看到。</p>
<p>一個人的架子，是地位所造成，也是從一般小卒拍馬所養成，雙方一鼓一　蕩，乃成這種環境，誰都不能　脫。</p>

<p>說出來，一定會使人驚奇到萬分。這片子，根本不是什麽公司的出品：牠是南京國民政府中央黨部宣傳部攝成的「國難」。這還是黨國當局，第一次用影片作社會敎育的利器哪！</p>
<p>這片子是不含任何劇情的，只是類於新聞的戰事寫實。凡是抗日軍士，都是片中的演員：侵我的日軍，上至上將，下至小卒，都是片中的反派角色丨</p>
<p>在戰地極紊亂慘怖的沙塲，有聲是有些不可能。但是，雖然無聲，那種有生氣的戰鬥，也足以呌我們深深的認識了民族的靈魂：會感到極大的壓迫丨丨剌激丨</p>
<p>内容包括了：九一八的瀋陽夜襲：二十一年元旦錦州被奪；難民的入關，義勇軍血戰匝歲：一二八，閘北的焚燒：十九軍苦戰十週；到虹口白川被炸爲止。完全是當時當地所攝的眞情實景。不但是給繁華都市中，居民的一張敎育宣傳片：也是供給國際間，明瞭一切戰事眞像的參考好資料。</p>
<p>這張巨大的珍貴影片。其中不少是借力於外國人。由當時當地，中立的美國人，攝成了許多片段的，由中央當局購買了剪接而成的。（上海戰事，則係中央特派專員自攝）。</p>
<p>不過，租界當局，對於我們宣傳民族的片子，是向例排斥的；所以這麽一張片子，竟不能在租界上，任何影院放映。退一步的辦法，只能到租界勢力範圍外的福安大戲院去演了丨而且中央宣傳部，指定了低廉的票價，以求普遍民間。當然　不是爲營業投機的設想的。</p>
<p>上海戰事片，給我們看見，至少有十部了，東北的，却還是第一次。我以國民一份子的責任，請大家騰出些工夫來，去看一看這張破天荒的「國難」丨</p>

<h3>羅克「戲迷傳」</h3>
<p>— 寄病</p>
<p>從四川路新雅一個電影的集團出來跨進了光陸的大門去看那「美利堅一千多種的電影刋物同聲讚美」（廣告這樣告訴我）的「戲迷傳」｛</p>
<p>看羅克的電影是僅僅爲了一點浮面的笑而去的，我很承認這句話。你看他在銀幕上製造着種種詼諧，免不了跟着大家笑笑，但當四座的電燈發光，你决不會再去把那笑料重新廻味，你毫無思想的笑，你毫無留戀的忘去。</p>
<p>劇情約略如此，一個明星熱的靑年哈羅，應好蘭塢某影片公司之徵，前往試演，在攝影塲上，愛上了一個女明星曼麗。試演的結果不佳，但是當曼麗和她底男主角拍戲男主角舉槍欲射的時候，哈羅誤以爲眞，與之搏鬥，影片公司總理見哈羅表演甚佳，與之簽訂合同，而完成了他成爲明星的熱望。</p>
<p>故事是很簡單的，但是有了許多有趣的穿揷，一路演來，也就熱鬧非常，笑料滿佈着全劇，運用得頗爲得當，這在導演方面，一定很費過一點力，力爲吾們知道，一部滑稽片之拍攝，其難處不在笑料之搜集而在其運用。水戰是全劇的關鍵，羅克在這幾個塲面裏也特别賣力，然而最令人捧腹的却是誤穿了魔術家的服裝袖子裏滾出鷄蛋，胸膛裏飛出白鴿，衣袋裏放出許多小鼠把跳舞塲鬧得天翻地覆的幾幕。女主角康絲登克敏的化裝很好，她底平裝和西班牙裝是完全兩個人的樣子，表演也還不錯，只是水戰時稍爲軟弱些，不過這幾幕裏她也並不重要。</p>
<p>導演很聰明，開場以切肉器爲攝影機，以葱爲花，以烟斗作手槍，以冰箱作Ｃ;pset（小間），足顯得極有想像能力，而一個靑年的「明星熱」亦藉此而寫得淋漓盡致。攝影亦佳，惟對白太無力量。</p>
<p>爲「買笑」而去，你决不至於失望，若是目的不僅在此，那末省下你底一塊錢吧，因爲說得稍爲嚴格一些，「戲迷傳」裏除了幾塲攝影塲的背景可作我們參考之外，其餘悉屬胡鬧，這裏面，沒有一椿事是有發生在實際生活之内的可能性的。</p>
<p>隨便談談</p>
<h3>如是我解</h3>
<p>— 華之</p>
<p>丨答覆「一個有趣的問題」丨關於「明星」的稱謂，恰恰館主在本刋上提出了「一個有趣的問題」，此刻我就以自已的一點膚淺的見解，試答如下：</p>
<p>我以爲「明星」兩字，是不僅專指電影界的名角，同時也泛指一切藝術界的泰斗，所以還是藝術界的一個有趣的向題。那麽，我們究竟爲什麽却稱　爲「明星」而不名之曰「明月」，其理由是不外下列諸點：</p>
<p>（一）從實際方面考察起來，第一明星是很多的，明月却只一個，因此，以「」明星形容著名演員，比較確當。其次明星似有躍躍閃動的光景，不像明月樣平板而不生動，以此形容演員之出現於銀幕，亦甚相稱，此外，月有陰晴圓缺，星則隨時都有，正可暗喻演員之夜夜出映</p>
<p>（二）從象徵的會議方面考察起來，也瑚</p>
<p>有許多理由可述：第一，明星兩字暗示藝術的食糧之命意和含議。現代著名象徵派詩人，愛玲波（ＡllanＰoe）說過人的心靈中所渴求的藝術的仙果其對象除了花的螺旋，密密的樹叢，田野的波麥，東方高樹的砍伐，山坡的綠景，白雲的取散，隱隱的小河之閃閃，銀河的返照以外，最初　是最後的糧食即是天空中熠耀的星光和井底深處的星影。這裏完全吐露明星的神秘性，第二，明星兩字的語源，象徵着命軍。歐西的（Ｓtar），中國的星宿，都有福星和災星等，所以此字足以象徵演員之出沒升降的運命。第三，在夜影下，黑暗中，羣星亂飛，</p>

<h3>Main Points of Today's Newspaper</h3>
<p>Domestic: The Legislative Yuan passed the Commodity Inspection Law; the Jiaoji Railway held a board meeting yesterday to discuss the redemption plan; Song Ziwen and Luo Wengan denied direct Sino-Japanese negotiations to various envoys yesterday.</p>
<p>International: The League of Nations Administrative Council decided to transfer the Sino-Japanese case to the General Assembly; the US attitude on war debts has had a serious impact; the German cabinet is stillborn; the Japanese cabinet decided on the budget.</p>
<p>Shanghai: Various Shanghai organizations sent telegrams to comfort the delegation; Muslims also sent telegrams to the League of Nations, requesting them to preside over justice; the agreement on the cross-border road construction area has been negotiated; the bomber in the Hongkou Park bombing, Yoon Bong-gil, has been handed over to Japan.</p>
<h3>League of Nations Administrative Council Decides to Transfer the Sino-Japanese Dispute to the General Assembly</h3>
<p>The Special Committee of Nineteen is scheduled to convene next Monday.</p>
<p>The investigation team held its second meeting yesterday to consider the response.</p>
<h3>Chairman Éamon de Valera Delivers a Solemn Speech, Hoping that China and Japan Will Not Take Actions that Undermine the League of Nations</h3>
<p>From external sources, a telegram from our delegation in Geneva reported that the League of Nations Administrative Council continued its meeting at 3:30 PM on the 25th, with Lytton attending to express his views. The five representatives of the League of Nations investigation team held a meeting on the morning of the 25th, and decided on the principle of Lytton's speech. After Lytton's speech, if the Japanese representative no longer obstructs, the Sino-Japanese issue will be discussed by the fourteen member states of the Administrative Council once, and then the meeting minutes and Lytton's report will be sent to the Committee of Nineteen. The Administrative Council meeting, originally scheduled for two weeks, is expected to end this Saturday. If Representative Matsuoka of Japan still needs to speak after Lytton's report, then Representative Gu of our country will also request the opportunity to express his views, which may extend the meeting date to next Monday or Tuesday.</p>
<p>The League of Nations Administrative Council has been meeting for several days to discuss the Lytton Report. Originally, Lytton was scheduled to speak and respond to the opinions of both China and Japan on the report, but due to Matsuoka's opposition, the meeting on the 24th was supported by countries such as Britain and Spain, and it was decided that Lytton would respond after the meeting at 3:30 PM on the 25th. It is expected that Lytton's remarks will strongly defend the report, and he will reiterate that the "Manchukuo" cannot be recognized. Matsuoka may make another sophistical argument on this, so the continued meeting on the 26th is still difficult to conclude immediately, and the date for transferring it to the Committee of Nineteen may be extended to the beginning of next week. Before the transfer, the Administrative Council will make a resolution to accept the first eight chapters of the Lytton Report, while the ninth and tenth chapters, which are solutions, will be left to a special general assembly for discussion.</p>
<p>This morning, it was learned here that the League of Nations General Assembly may hold a special meeting on December 5 to consider the Sino-Japanese dispute. This news has not yet been verified, but the date seems very close, as a week's notice is required to convene the General Assembly. (Reuters, Geneva, 25th)</p>
<p>It is now generally decided in Geneva to convene the Special Committee of Nineteen on November 28 to consider the Sino-Japanese dispute. The Special Committee may convene the League of Nations General Assembly to meet on December 3. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>The Administrative Council meeting in Geneva this afternoon was postponed to next Monday because Japanese representative Matsuoka had to consult with his home government. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>There was talk in Geneva of the Lytton Commission meeting formally at the League of Nations Secretariat, but no formal meeting has yet been held. It is said that informal talks were held in a hotel today in an effort to reduce their response to the Administrative Council to the shortest possible form. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<h3>Situation of Yesterday's Meeting</h3>
<p>The Chairman Urges Both Sides to Seriously Consider</p>
<p>So That the Sino-Japanese Case Can Be Fundamentally Resolved</p>
<p>The International Administrative Council met at 4 PM this afternoon, first dealing with the report submitted to the Administrative Council on the dispute between the South American countries of Bolivia and Paraguay, and the border issue between Iraq and Syria, and then resumed discussion of the Sino-Japanese dispute. First, the Japanese opinion on the participation of the Lytton Commission members in the discussion was read. It was claimed that the work of the investigation team had ended when its report was delivered to the Administrative Council. Japan does not object to questions from the investigation team members, but does not recognize their qualifications to comment on the speeches made by the Chinese and Japanese representatives at the Administrative Council meeting. The opinion also stated the position taken by Matsuoka yesterday. Lord Lytton answered Chairman de Valera's question, saying that if the investigation team's report could help the Administrative Council, the members would be very happy. Apart from this, the members were unwilling to say anything more or add anything to their report. The chairman then asked the meeting if there were any questions. Czech representative Beneš rose and said that he felt the simplest way was to submit the entire matter to a special meeting of the League of Nations General Assembly, and he reserved the right to criticize at the General Assembly. The chairman then asked the meeting if the Administrative Council could wait for some time before submitting the case to a special general assembly. For practical consideration, it seemed that the Administrative Council should not have a general discussion. Submitting the case to the General Assembly for review would not hinder the opportunity for the directors of the Administrative Council to express their opinions on the report. What the Chinese and Japanese representatives said did not give people hope of quickly resolving this dispute. There seemed to be no degree of compromise between the two sides, which the Administrative Council could base on to express hopeful opinions. He hoped that the current views of China and Japan did not represent the final views of their governments, and hoped that both sides would not reject a solution that could be resolved once and for all. If the League of Nations mechanism is not allowed to work as much as possible, or is hindered by the non-cooperation of any party involved, it is a direct act of intolerable resistance to public opinion. The chairman finally urged both sides to give serious consideration to what they could do to help the League of Nations.</p>
<h3>De Valera and Matsuoka Argue Fiercely</h3>
<p>Geneva: After a verbal battle between Gu Weijun and Matsuoka this afternoon, Chairman de Valera, in response to a question from Matsuoka, said that in his opinion, the members of the Lytton Commission should attend the Administrative Council meeting and answer the questions that the Administrative Council wished to ask. Matsuoka asked whether this question and answer was limited to the scope of the report and the opinion. De Valera then explained that his proposal the night before was to find out whether what the members of the investigation team heard could make them willing to modify their report.</p>
<p>〓Japanese Representative Opposes Investigation Team Attending〓</p>
<p>Matsuoka continued, saying that if the Administrative Council and the investigation team were to begin questions and answers on the Manchurian issue, this matter would go beyond the scope of the investigation team's mission, and once this question and answer began, the discussion might last for a month, because he would reserve the right to question the investigation team members about events outside the report. De Valera replied that the only question the investigation team would state was whether the investigation team was still willing to adhere to its report, or whether it was willing to modify it. Matsuoka then said, "If the investigation team feels that there is no reason to change its report, then I will of course have to ask it why it is unwilling to modify it. This simple question may lead to a month of interrogation." Matsuoka's debate with Chairman de Valera on this point continued for a long time. Matsuoka always believed that the investigation team should not participate in the Administrative Council's discussion. De Valera then asked the opinion of the directors of the Administrative Council.</p>
<p>〓Czech and Spanish Representatives Support De Valera〓</p>
<p>Czech representative Beneš spoke first, saying that the chairman had made a fair explanation of the usual procedures. He fully agreed with the chairman that although the investigation team had completed its work, its existence had not yet been extinguished, so the Administrative Council had the right to ask it questions. Spanish representative Madariaga supported Beneš's view, saying that he saw no reason to oppose the investigation team expressing its views after hearing the debate. The investigation team had indeed written a report, but if requested, it could provide another report, so the investigation team was free to answer any questions. The investigation team still exists today, and it does not matter if the discussion is extended as a result.</p>
<p>〓Simon Cites Drummond's Precedent in Support〓</p>
<p>British Foreign Secretary Simon then rose to speak, beginning by citing precedent to support de Valera's decision, citing the matter of League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond, believing that there had long been this practice. Simon claimed that the members of the investigation team were not participating in this meeting as bystanders. The Administrative Council's invitation to them to attend clearly had a beneficial purpose. What is this purpose? It is nothing more than to give their support to what the Administrative Council is now discussing.</p>
<p>〓Matsuoka Yields and Allows a Written Reply〓</p>
<p>Matsuoka said that Drummond's precedent strengthened Japan's view even more. He did not explain the process in his report to the members of the investigation team, but in principle, he opposed the intervention of the members of the investigation team in the Administrative Council's proceedings. He asked the Administrative Council to allow him to present Japan's views in writing. De Valera agreed, but said that he could not oppose the investigation team meeting to consider whether they were willing to revise or add to their report. The Administrative Council adjourned at 5:55 PM and scheduled to resume discussion at 3:30 PM on Friday.</p>
<p>〓British Believe Japanese Opposition is Unreasonable〓</p>
<p>The view here among the British is that Japan's opposition to the Lytton Commission is based on misunderstanding. Judging from Matsuoka's attitude, it seems that he has the feeling that the investigation team is a servant of the Administrative Council, rather than a critic or master of the Administrative Council, and is afraid that the investigation team is in the position of a judge, and judges each point that only the Administrative Council can resolve. Simon's statement that the attendance of the investigation team is not for the sake of spectacle is highly valued by British observers. It is reasonable for the Administrative Council to use its personnel affairs. Public opinion here is gradually believing that the Sino-Japanese issue will soon be handled directly by the League of Nations General Assembly, but it may be formally transferred by the Special Committee of Nineteen. It is said that the Administrative Council will find it extremely difficult to deal with this matter, because the Administrative Council's resolution must be unanimously agreed. Therefore, the most practical way to implement it is to handle this matter in the League of Nations General Assembly. Matsuoka's statement that Japan is willing to be a faithful supporter of the League of Nations has aroused deep impression, because he showed sincere meaning when expressing his national feelings. British Foreign Secretary Simon may have to leave for London tomorrow night to discuss the points arising from the disarmament situation with British Prime Minister MacDonald, and will return to Geneva in a few days. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>〓Playing Petty Tricks is a Japanese Diplomatic Habit〓</p>
<p>Tokyo: According to a telegram from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Geneva, Matsuoka Yosuke's efforts to prevent Lytton from speaking were considered to be making trouble for no reason, with the aim of delaying the Administrative Council meeting. This is a common method used by the Japanese Diet. Europe and constitutional countries believe that Japan is playing petty tricks to avoid fair discussion. The Japanese Ministry of Internal Affairs telegraphed Representative Matsuoka to advise him not to lose the sympathy of various countries due to small matters. (China United Press, 25th)</p>
<h3>Song and Luo Deny Direct Negotiations to Various Envoys Yesterday</h3>
<p>Japanese Rumormongering is Commonplace</p>
<p>Nanjing: As the League of Nations Administrative Council has been holding meetings for days to discuss the Lytton Report, Japan has been spreading rumors that there is a possibility of direct negotiations between China and Japan. Acting President of the Executive Yuan Song Ziwen and Foreign Minister Luo Wengan met with foreign guests such as US Ambassador Johnson, French Envoy Veleton, German Envoy Dodd, Italian Envoy Ciano, and British Chargé d'Affaires 应标兰 at Song's private residence in Beijige on the morning of the 25th. When discussing this matter, Song formally stated that the theory of direct Sino-Japanese negotiations is absolutely untrue. Japan has spread rumors of direct negotiations every time the League of Nations holds a meeting, which is commonplace and not surprising. Now that the Sino-Japanese issue has entered the hands of the League of Nations, the League of Nations should quickly seek an appropriate solution and maintain the dignity of the League of Nations itself and the Covenant. (Central News Agency, 25th)</p>
<h3>Davis is Matsuoka's Only Strong Rival</h3>
<p>Italian Pessimism About the Future of the Manchurian Case</p>
<p>Rome: Italy expresses pessimism about the future of the League of Nations resolving the Manchurian issue. Former Italian representative to Geneva, Marinis, said that in his view, the League of Nations will still make lukewarm recommendations, and the issues that China and Japan cannot agree on will remain unresolved. The Gardino newspaper reported that if the parties involved were only China and Japan, this issue could be resolved by itself, but behind China, there is also the United States. Matsuoka's real rival in Geneva is not Yan Huiqing, but Davis. When Davis toured London, Paris, and Rome, he discussed not only the disarmament issue, but also Manchurian solutions that would benefit the United States. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<h3>Davis Responds to Matsuoka's Visit</h3>
<p>Clarifying America's Position on the Far East Question</p>
<p>Geneva: US Representative Davis went to the Metropole Hotel at 10:30 this morning to meet with Japanese Representative Matsuoka in response to Matsuoka's visit the day before. Afterwards, they discussed the overall situation in the Far East. He left at 11:15 AM. During this meeting, the two had a cordial conversation on the Monroe Doctrine in the Far East. Matsuoka argued that in order to establish peace in the Far East and further maintain world peace, there is no other way than the Monroe Doctrine in the Far East. The League of Nations' involvement in the Far East issue is the cause of the dispute. Davis also explained the US attitude towards the League of Nations' review of the Sino-Japanese dispute. As for the Monroe Doctrine in the Far East, no conclusion was reached. (Dentsu Telegram, 24th)</p>
<h3>German Foreign Minister Denies Favoring Japan</h3>
<p>Berlin: The German government issued a formal statement today, denying the claim in the Geneva Daily that German Foreign Minister Neurath stated that Germany must favor Japan for economic reasons in the Sino-Japanese dispute. It said that this is completely unfounded and purely a rumor. (National Telegram, 24th)</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Europe and the Americas Support the Delegation</h3>
<p>Geneva: The Chinese delegation in Geneva has received many telegrams from overseas Chinese in Europe, the Americas, and Southeast Asia supporting them. Overseas Chinese here are now collecting money to support the Northeastern Volunteers. (Central News Agency, 25th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Holds a Leaders' Meeting</h3>
<p>Instructing Matsuoka to Attend the Committee of Nineteen and Strive to Promote Direct Negotiations</p>
<p>Tokyo: According to a bulletin from the Japanese delegation in Geneva to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the League of Nations Council's transfer of the Sino-Japanese issue to the General Assembly, and the convening of the Committee of Nineteen in the near future, has almost been decided. The delegation has telegraphed for instructions on countermeasures. As a result of the discussion by the heads of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday afternoon:</p>
<p>(1) Although the Japanese government opposes convening a General Assembly or Committee of Nineteen in accordance with Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant on the Manchurian issue, if the Council adopts the convening of the General Assembly by majority vote as a procedural issue, it will not forcibly oppose it. Therefore, in the Council, it will only make a reservation of opposition. (2) In the Committee of Nineteen, it will abandon its previous attitude of denial, and Representative Matsuoka will act as an explainer to clearly explain Japan's position. (3) If the Committee of Nineteen reaches an understanding with Japan, the Japanese government will not hesitate to proceed according to the established policy. All opinions were unanimous, and this message was telegraphed to the Geneva delegation last night. (Dentsu News Agency, 25th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: According to a telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the important intentions of the major countries in Geneva are as follows: (1) The Japanese opinion should not be regarded as the final opinion. If the Japanese representative can be persuaded to a certain extent, or can be eased. (2) The deliberation of the Three-Man Council must be shortened, and the Committee of Nineteen or the Provisional General Assembly must be convened as soon as possible. If the Japanese representative can be persuaded by a majority, it will be more effective in easing the opinion.</p>
<p>However, the heads of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs hold the following views on this:</p>
<p>(1) Thoroughly make the major countries understand that the Japanese opinion is the final opinion and not a matter of bargaining. (2) Make the focus of discussion in the Council, the Committee of Nineteen, and the Provisional General Assembly focus on the current situation and future of "Manchukuo", without affecting past issues. (3) The final solution to the Manchurian issue is to strongly advocate that it can be directly negotiated between China and Japan. However, in this direct negotiation, related countries can only attend as observers, and can only speak on issues of common interest, and are in principle not allowed to speak. (4) For matters in mainland China that are negotiated in parallel with this direct negotiation, representatives of related countries (including Chinese and Japanese representatives) can be invited to an international conference. (Dentsu News Agency, 25th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Delegation Meets to Discuss League of Nations Countermeasures</h3>
<p>Deciding on a Policy to Prepare to Challenge the Investigation Team and Oppose the Cancellation of Recognition of the Puppet State</p>
<p>Geneva: The Japanese delegation met at the Metropole Hotel at 9:30 last night. Representatives Matsuoka, Nagaoka, and Sato, Ambassador Matsudaira, and other participants, as well as Deputy Director of the Secretariat Sugimura, gathered to discuss countermeasures against the Council until 2:00 this morning. As a result, the following policy was decided: (1) The Investigation Team has submitted its final report, and today, when Japan has submitted its opinion, to ask the Investigation Team whether there are any changes to the report is to trample on the Investigation Team's final report, insult the Japanese opinion, and further damage the dignity of the Council itself. If the Council continues to proceed according to this policy, Japan will fight back with the view that "the Investigation Team has completed its mission", with the main purpose of reservation. (2) If the atmosphere in the Council does not improve, Japan's countermeasures will continue to proceed according to the established policy. However, even if the Council completes its deliberations, if there are demands to cancel the recognition of "Manchukuo" and deny independence as a result of the actions of small countries, it will resolutely express its attitude of preparing for the worst.

<p>After the Central Government Reiterates the Ceasefire Order, Many Generals in Sichuan Tend Towards Peace</p>
<h3>Liu, Deng, and Tian Meet Again to Negotiate a Settlement; Second-Tier Generals Sun Zhen and Others Agree to a Ceasefire</h3>
<p>It is rumored that the Central Government will establish a Sichuan Post-War Consolidation Committee</p>
<h3>Liu Xiang Sets a Deadline to Capture Chengdu</h3>
<p>Hankou: After the Central Government's order to stop the Sichuan War arrived in Sichuan, the situation on the front line gradually eased. Liu Cunhou, Yang Sen, Li Jiayu, and Luo Zezhou all telegraphed Deng Xihou, tending towards peace, and sent representatives to Chengdu to negotiate. According to a telegram from Chengdu, Deng Xihou, Tian Songyao, and Liu Wenhui met for the second time on the afternoon of the 24th and held lengthy consultations. It is said that a telegram was issued, acknowledging that all past civil wars were manipulated by Liu Xiang, and that they would now restrain the ambitions of Chongqing and seek instructions from the Central Government for the post-war situation in Sichuan. (Special Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Hankou: It is widely rumored that the Central Government will establish a Sichuan Post-War Consolidation Committee, with Zhang Qun as the chairman, and two other senior officials and Sichuan generals as members. The full committee can be realized after the meeting. (Special Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Chengdu: Since Deng Xihou, commander of the 28th Army, issued a public telegram on the 19th requesting a cessation of hostilities, Liu Wenhui replied to Deng's telegram on the 24th, saying, "Having read the telegram, I feel pain and grief. In today's national crisis, civil war is the most shameful. Therefore, since the beginning of the Sichuan affair, Wenhui has followed the Central Government's orders and made every effort to show concessions, hoping to avoid it, and voluntarily gave up defensive positions to more than 20 counties, as a factual expression. Furthermore, I have always thought that I have been in charge of Sichuan's politics for several years, but my achievements have not been outstanding, and I have not been able to satisfy the hopes of all parties. I have also submitted a plan for governing Sichuan to the National Government, hoping to see it implemented. However, this sincere intention has not been understood, and the fraternal strife has been too urgent. I have been forced to defend myself, and the battles of Luzhou and Zigong and the provincial capital have recently resulted in many deaths and injuries, and the destruction of houses. My heart is torn, and my intestines are burning. It is indeed as you said, 'Governance has not yet been achieved, but the scourge of war is seen first.' If there is a sincere desire to seek governance, who would not be happy to follow along with humility? Moreover, gathering ideas is to broaden the benefits, and openness is especially valuable for transparency. Since we are all seeking the welfare of our hometown, there is no difficulty in calmly negotiating. Now that I have received your sincere mediation, everyone has responded to the call. Hui has always implemented the purpose of improving the Sichuan situation through peaceful means, and has ordered his troops to immediately cease military action. I also hope that all parties will express their sympathy, advocate unity, guide peace, and eliminate this atmosphere of war. The future of Sichuan depends on it." (Special Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Chengdu: Sichuan second-tier generals Sun Zhen and others responded to Deng Xihou's telegram, saying, "We have received the telegram from Commander Jin Gong, and his painstaking efforts to love peace and maintain the Sichuan situation are obvious. People are not made of wood or stone, and how can they not be moved? This time, all parties attempted to improve the Sichuan administration, but unfortunately, it evolved into war, bloodshed, and corpses, which is heartbreaking. We, Zhen and others, are among the ranks, and our hearts are tied to our hometown. We regret that construction has not been achieved, but destruction is seen first. This was not expected, but fortunately, the days to come can be pursued. Since Jin Gong has made a high-pitched call, and you and Gong are responding in unison, we, Zhen and others, will naturally follow in the footsteps of the generals and strive for the same goal. From now on, let us all cease hostilities, treat each other with sincerity, and we hope that all fellow soldiers will unanimously cease fighting and adhere to the proposals in the telegrams, and the proposals put forward in the telegram from Zigong, and promote their realization through political methods. Let the chariots of war be exchanged for a meeting of clothing, and let the atmosphere of war be eliminated and replaced by the light of the sun and moon. The future of Sichuan may be promising." (Special Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Losing Sovereignty and Humiliating the Country is the Diplomatic Policy. (Special Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Nanjing: A telegram from Chongqing said that Liu Wenhui's troops retreated towards Jiading, determined to temporarily defend Jiading, and Chengdu arranged a retreat route. On the one hand, they were still preparing to counterattack. The Allied forces of Pan Wenhua and others were ordered to follow and pursue. Also, according to Sichuan representative Xi, the Allied forces of Yang and Luo advanced to the west of Jingxian to cut off the connection between the provincial army, and gathered in Jiading. (Special Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Liu Xiang telegraphed Pan Wenhua, Wang Zhiyi, Tang Shizun, Mu Yingzhou, etc. on the 24th, ordering them to supervise their troops and advance westward in separate routes, aiming to capture Chengdu by the end of the month and complete unification. He gave many instructions on the offensive strategies of each route, and sent six aircraft and two warships to the front line to assist in the battle. (Central News Agency, 25th)</p>
<h3>Muto Formally Appointed as Japanese Ambassador to the Puppet State</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Muto, who has been in Manchukuo in the form of a dispatch, was formally appointed as the official ambassador to Manchuria following today's cabinet decision: Muto Nobuyoshi, specially appointed plenipotentiary ambassador, ordered to reside in Manchukuo. (Dentsu News Agency, 24th)</p>
<h3>A Large Part of Liu Zhennian's Division Transferred to Pucheng</h3>
<p>The Remainder Stationed in Longquan and Qingyuan in Zhejiang</p>

The details of the Japanese threats and demands have been announced to the League of Nations. The international community expresses great sympathy for our armed resistance.

The first batch consisted of over a hundred people, and the second batch consisted of thirty-eight people.

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Will Japan Withdraw from the League of Nations?</h3>
<p>— You Xuan</p>
<p>I. × × × ×</p>
<p>Diplomacy in Geneva has already reached the point of direct confrontation. Our country's representatives are exerting their perseverance to fight the aggressor. The righteous armies in Northern Manchuria are also relying on their flesh and blood to fight against airplanes and artillery with national indignation. If there is still "reason" and "justice" in the world, then the final victory will undoubtedly belong to us. However, the key to victory lies in how hard our people work. Consider the January 28 Incident. When the war was in full swing and our entire country was united to fight the enemy, the atmosphere of the League of Nations and world opinion turned to provide us with spiritual assistance. This shows that the saying "Heaven helps those who help themselves" is not empty talk. If we do not rely solely on the League of Nations but strive to defend ourselves, then it will not be difficult to find allies in the international community. The current international situation has changed slightly. Japan's monopoly of aggression has become more blatant. It is bound to become isolated in the international community. France, which was originally sympathetic to Japan, has now publicly stated that it is not prepared to recognize Manchukuo. Then Japan has lost its grip on controlling the League of Nations. It advocates that... The League of Nations is a European alliance and is a necessary mechanism for Europe.</p>
<p>It has no effect outside of Europe. And it confesses that "Japan's efforts to the League of Nations, 30 million in expenses, but what are the benefits obtained?" Its intention seems to be that if the League of Nations cannot help Japan to obtain the three northeastern provinces, then the League of Nations has lost its function. Alas! This kind of low-level, sensational agitation is enough to arouse temporary emotional impulses among the people of that country. However, are all countries in the world all anesthetized and forever fascinated by Japanese militarism?</p>
<p>Since the League of Nations resolution of thirteen votes to one vote last year, it has continued to act willfully, disregarding international integrity, trampling on the Non-Aggression Pact and the Nine-Power Treaty, and attacking our Northeast with its iron fist, destroying world peace. The "Open Door, Equal Opportunity" is just a diplomatic slogan on the lips of the Japanese. Therefore, in the administrative meeting on the 21st of this month, Japan lost the sympathy of various countries. Although the Japanese representative Matsuoka argued strongly, how could he completely reverse the facts? As a result, the mouthpiece of the Japanese clique, the foreign affairs authorities, issued a rumor of withdrawing from the League of Nations. The main reasons it holds are as follows.</p>
<p>II. × × × ×</p>
<p>"1. The League of Nations is based on the spirit of Wilson and the power of Clemenceau. However, the United States and Russia have not participated. In fact, it is only a European alliance. Since last autumn, the words of the League of Nations have almost completely exposed its lack of qualifications to speak on Far Eastern issues."</p>
<p>"2. Regarding the Manchurian issue, Japan has its own traditional national policy, which does not allow other countries to interfere. However, since last autumn, the reason for being annoyed by the empty discussions of the League of Nations is that it was confused by the words of the five major powers, the three major powers, and the first-class countries. It has been dealing with the unnecessary League of Nations, resulting in the present situation."</p>
<p>"3. The independence of Manchuria and the situation since last autumn have completely changed. Japan has long had grounds for requesting the League of Nations to withdraw its intervention in the Manchurian issue. Now, if the League of Nations is allowed to review again and succumb to the pressure of strongmen, Japan's policy toward 'Manchuria' will open the way for interference from the League of Nations."</p>
<p>"Therefore, at this time, Japan will no longer maintain a passive attitude. It will take action to fulfill the expectations of the people and implement withdrawal from the League of Nations... At the same time, it will move forward bravely to show its determination for peace in the Far East..."</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the hard-line advocacy of the Japanese military is also one aspect of the warlord politics. We also recall that Matsuoka Yosuke's trip to Geneva, via the Soviet Union, stayed in Moscow for more than a week, repeatedly contacting Soviet officials. What was the result? Outsiders rarely know. However, the Soviet diplomats, who are known for their political maneuvering, would not allow the Japanese warlord diplomats to play with them. However, the Japanese have a deep intention in this, and they are using this as a powerful tool to threaten Britain and the United States and intimidate France in order to obtain a favorable position on the Northeast issue in the League of Nations.</p>
<p>III. × × × ×</p>
<p>Then, will Japan really withdraw from the League of Nations? If we only make judgments based on diplomatic propaganda, then it is inevitable that it will be one-sided. Now let us try to clarify it with the remarks of the Japanese army authorities on the 21st of this month. "The League of Nations Investigation Committee does not recognize the restoration of the state before September 18 as satisfactory. Similarly, it also recognizes that the state of returning Manchuria to the state before Japan's recognition is impossible... then the countries recognize the existence of Manchuria as an accomplished fact..." And they advocate the special nature of this issue. Although they strongly reject the criticisms of various small countries, they do not seem as fierce as they did in attacking the report when it was released previously. Judging from this, even if the Japanese cliques are unwilling to fully accept the Lytton Report, they will not completely oppose it. If Japan really withdraws from the League of Nations, its domestic difficulties will inevitably be multiplied, and the diplomatic situation will also change suddenly. At this time, Japan's financial problems, the total amount of annual expenditures is more than 2,237 million yen, while the total amount of annual income is only 133 million yen, the total amount of shortfall is nearly 90 million yuan (yen). It is using public debt to fill the gap. This is really an abnormal state that has never existed since Japan opened its country. What is even more strange is that the military expenditure of the army and navy amounts to 82 million yuan (yen), and the annual expenditure for the aggression of the Northeast is still reserved for temporary additions, and it cannot be predicted. Then the Japanese militarists are afraid that without the outbreak of war, finance will be a fatal blow.</p>
<p>Although Japan is not as heavily burdened by German reparations, the fulfillment of foreign debts, only in terms of normal relations, the exchange losses suffered by 73 kinds of foreign debts up to July of this year are as follows.</p>
<p>Budget for 1932 Increase compared to last year</p>
<p>Foreign debt interest 118,820 thousand yen 43,427 thousand yen</p>
<p>Foreign debt repayment amount 62,630 thousand yen 52,347 thousand yen</p>
<p>Total 181,450 thousand yen 95,774 thousand yen</p>
<p>Only considering this, its loss is nearly 100 million yuan. If we consider the recent exchange rate, it will increase by more than double. If it withdraws from the League of Nations, Japan's international credit will inevitably decline further, and financial loopholes will inevitably be exposed. Even if it has 3 million soldiers, it is afraid that it will be unable to advance or retreat. Although the Japanese cliques are strong and violent, they may not take into account their own interests. Then the so-called withdrawal from the League of Nations is mostly to intimidate various countries externally and to stimulate its people internally. How can it necessarily use its country as a desperate gamble?</p>
<p>Our country, facing this powerful enemy, must examine its current situation and take advantage of the situation to rise up and take action to avenge our humiliation.</p>

<h3>Wang Zhengting Arrived in Beijing from Beiping Yesterday</h3>
<p>Board of Directors of the Jiaozhou Railway Holds Meeting</p>
<p>Nanjing: Former Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting arrived in Beijing by train at 8:00 AM on the 25th. In the afternoon, he convened the Board of Directors of the Jiaozhou-Jinan Railway to hold a meeting. He will travel to Shanghai in the coming days and come to Beijing to attend the Third Plenary Session when it opens. Central News Agency reporters asked Wang if it was true that when Japanese representative Matsuoka cunningly defended the Tanaka Memorial at the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting, saying that the Tanaka Memorial was fabricated, Wang Zhengting allowed effective methods to be used to stop the circulation of the Memorial in 1930. They went to Wang's residence to inquire about whether this was true. Wang replied, "When I was the Minister of Foreign Affairs, I personally saw the Memorial. At that time, the Japanese Minister Shigemitsu met with me and talked about this matter. I told him, 'I have personally seen the Tanaka Memorial. As for whether it is true or not, Japan should know it itself, and there is no need to ask me.'" As for stopping the circulation of the Memorial, I have never said anything like that, and the government has no reason to stop the circulation of publications. The reporter asked again whether the Tanaka Memorial was fabricated as Matsuoka said. Wang replied that the representative Yan answered Matsuoka, saying, "The best proof of the authenticity of this document is the current situation in Manchuria. If you compare the Tanaka Memorial with Japan's current policies, you can judge." I think it is the best answer. The reporter asked again about the trend of the League of Nations meeting. Wang said that the League of Nations will be able to maintain its resolutions in the past, but it may not be easy to implement them one by one. However, if Japan's violent actions cannot be restrained, then the League of Nations Covenant, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Non-Aggression Pact will all become waste paper. The world situation will not only return to the state before Europe, but also return to the barbaric era. At present, politicians in various countries are still seeking perfection for Japan, but world opinion has unanimously become the backing of our country. Wang believes that the failure of the Japanese-Soviet treaty is a natural result, saying that oil and water can never be mixed. Japan is now in a completely isolated position. Wang finally said that he is determined to attend the Third Plenary Session and will participate in the Foreign Affairs Committee while in Beijing. (25th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>Hoover's Administrative Report Advocates Punishment for Violators of the Kellogg-Briand Pact</p>
<h3>And Reaffirms the Policy of Not Recognizing Territory Acquired by Force</h3>
<p>▲National Press Agency, Washington, 24th: US President Hoover is expected to prepare his administrative report to Congress and budget recommendations, starting tomorrow. Sources close to the President predict that the administrative report will reiterate the US foreign policy of not recognizing territory acquired by force and will call for punishment for those who violate the Kellogg-Briand Pact. At the same time, it will declare that the United States still wishes to remain uninvolved with other countries' affairs. Regarding the war debt issue, it is expected to only summarize the statement released yesterday. On the domestic front, it will differ greatly from the previous three administrative reports. First, regarding the prohibition law, although Hoover is a proponent of prohibition, he will comply with public opinion and express support for slightly modifying the prohibition law and easing the ban on beer to increase tax revenue. In addition, it is reported that he will declare opposition to increasing taxes, opposition to a general sales tax, opposition to reducing war debts, and advocate expanding the home loan bank system. He will propose increasing tariffs on certain agricultural products and a few manufactured goods threatened by cheap labor overseas. As for government spending, he will advocate even stricter austerity measures.</p>
<h3>New Discoveries in the Medical World</h3>
<p>▲The Pathogenic Bacteria of Leprosy</p>
<p>▲National Press Agency, Salt Lake City, 24th: Dr. Tynes, Director of the Medical School at the University of Utah, and Professor of Bacteriology Dr. Austin announced today that they have isolated an organic microorganism believed to be the pathogenic bacteria of leprosy. Dr. Tynes has been researching this matter for many years and now plans to go to the leprosy hospital in Hawaii to continue his research. It is noted that in 1916, Dr. Duval, a leprosy expert from Louisiana, first announced to the American Medical Association his discovery of bacteria that he believed to be the pathogenic bacteria of leprosy. However, further research was needed to prove the correctness of his experiment. Subsequently, bacteriology experts across the United States began specialized research based on his discovery. What Dr. Tynes announced today is the most important discovery since 1916. It is also reported that Dr. Tynes discovered that leprosy and tuberculosis have a close relationship in animals. Whether the newly discovered organic microorganism is the starting point for both diseases will also be studied further.</p>
<h3>A Madman Stabs Six to Death</h3>

<h3>Statistics on the Increase in the Population of Soviet Russia</h3>
<p>An Average Annual Increase of Two to Three Million People</p>
<p>▲TASS, Moscow, 24th: According to official statistics here, the current total population of the Soviet Union is 163,166,000. In 1897, the population of Russia was 106,400,000. By 1914, it had increased to 139,300,000. In 1928, it further increased to 150,400,000. In 1931, it again increased to 160,400,000. The above statistics show that the trend of population increase has not stopped, with an average annual increase of approximately two to three million people. Comparatively, the increase in various minority ethnic republics is even more significant. In the Tatar Republic, there was an increase of 1.5% in 1910 and 2.3% in 1930. In Crimea, there was an increase of 1.0% in 1910 and 1.4% in 1930. Since 1926, the urban population has increased rapidly. There are currently forty-six cities in the Soviet Union with a population of over 100,000, compared to only thirty-one in 1926. There are currently sixty-six cities with a population of 50,000 to 100,000, compared to only sixty in 1926. The Izvestia newspaper pointed out that in the fifteen years since the founding of the Soviet Union, more than a hundred new cities have been built, with the larger ones surpassing the old provincial capitals. In Mangitogorsk, the current population is 140,000 and is expected to increase to 250,000 in the future. The entire city of Zaporozhye has a population of 150,000. The capital of Turkmenistan also has a population of 150,000. Near Stalingrad, four large cities are under construction. In the Kuznetsk coal region of Algeria, fifteen cities have been built, with Stalinsk being the largest, with a population of nearly 150,000. The construction of these new cities is based on the most precise plans.</p>

<h3>The United States' Attitude Towards War Debts Has Triggered a Strong Reaction in Various Countries</h3>
<p>The British Government Carefully Considers the US Reply</p>
<p>Paris Newspapers Criticize with Obvious Disappointment</p>
<h3>Will the Sino-Japanese Issue Also Be Affected?</h3>
<p>▲Reuters, Geneva, 24th: There is deep concern here that the United States' attitude towards war debts will have serious repercussions in Geneva, not only unfavorable to the disarmament issue but also unfavorable to the Sino-Japanese dispute and the World Economic Conference. The news from Washington has poured cold water on the trend in France to support the United States' position on disarmament and the Manchurian issue. Therefore, it is feared that some parties may exhibit fierce opposition. However, Britain's policy has always been independent and focused on achieving practical goals and may not be affected by the war debt issue. Therefore, as far as Britain is concerned, the war debt issue does not have an immediate relationship with disarmament and the Far East issue.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 24th: The US government's reply to the British application for deferral of the debt payment due on December 15 is currently under careful consideration in various relevant departments in London. It is reported that the US reply is very lengthy and expresses the US government's views based on the points mentioned in yesterday's White House statement. Political circles in London are currently maintaining strict silence on this issue. Various rumors speculating about the government's actions are not coming from responsible sources. When the House of Commons met this afternoon, Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain refused to make any comments on the issue. The US reply has not yet been submitted to the Cabinet for discussion.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 24th: Former Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer Horne stated emphatically in the House of Commons tonight that Britain should pay the US debt due on December 15, as Britain's finances have recently recovered remarkably, and failure to fulfill the debt would damage the overall structure of world credit. Horne advocated paying the debt with gold bars and temporarily canceling the debt repayment reserve fund, as a clear way to deal with the US debt. At the same time, Britain can still purchase its needs from other countries on a gold pound basis. Horne pointed out that the actions of the United States will delay the recovery of world prosperity. Horne also said that world trade uses the pound for more than half of its transactions, with Britain as the center. Britain's strength lies in this, so the government must be responsible for monetary matters and take a leading role. A majority of members of the House of Commons supported the government's view that Britain has good reason to apply for a deferral of the next war debt payment, but they also applauded Horne's statement that Britain should pay the debt and repay it in cash.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 24th: The entire war debt issue is, of course, being discussed by all parties. Australian Representative to the UK Bruce emphasized at the American Club Thanksgiving banquet today the responsibility of British and American authorities to eliminate all obstacles through mutual understanding. He said that the world is currently going through a dangerous period unprecedented in history. If we want to resolve its difficulties, we can only rely on complete understanding and cooperation between Britain and the United States, and the American people have an even greater opportunity and a greater responsibility. Although Britain has this aspiration, it does not have the same ability as the United States. Britain's efforts in manpower and finance during the war, and its generous treatment of debtor countries after the war, have exhausted its own strength. Britain's actions in maintaining its own financial position over the past eleven months have shown that Britain can no longer help others. Although Britain is wealthy, it is still a great power in the face of difficulties, unmatched by other countries. If we do not find a way to restore the economic system of the world to the prosperity of all countries within a short period, then this system will have no hope of continuing to exist. The serious event at present is only the issue of whether the war debt interest due on December 15 should be paid or deferred. The interest has already been deferred for fifteen months, but he believes that a further deferral of interest payment will have a good psychological impact and can promote the success of the World Economic Conference. The importance of this conference cannot be overstated. In conclusion, if this conference fails, how much will the obligations on war debts amount to? If this conference succeeds, then this problem can be easily solved.</p>
<p>▲Havas, Paris, 25th: The United States' negative reply to the demands of various debtor countries has been met with criticism in the newspapers, with obvious disappointment. The newspapers believe that the demands of the European countries are very justified, and the reasons stated by President Hoover are not sufficient to convince. Some newspapers deeply express dissatisfaction that Hoover has mixed the war debt issue with the disarmament issue, and seems to be using this method to put pressure on France, so that it will accept disarmament measures that are incompatible with national security. The newspapers repeatedly state that the firm attitude of the United States will cause a dangerous backlash to the world economy, and the result will be unfavorable to the United States, just as to European countries. However, most newspapers place much hope on the new President Roosevelt, saying that President Hoover's policies should not make Roosevelt responsible for them.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Washington, 24th: Regardless of how Britain phrases its next letter, some debtor countries must pay their debts on December 15, or default. It seems that members of Congress have reached a consensus on this resolution. They are also unwilling to agree to temporarily pay debts in foreign currency. As for the issue of establishing a committee to handle future debt payments, opinions have not yet been unified. President-elect Roosevelt opposes this proposal. He probably wants to have a free hand to use war debts as a tool for manipulation in disarmament and the World Economic Conference.</p>
<p>▲National Press Agency, London, 25th: Since the situation of war debts has become bleak, the pound has continued to fall today. At 11:05 AM, the British-American exchange rate fell to US$3.225, the lowest price since Britain abandoned the gold standard, only one and a half US cents higher than the lowest exchange rate on February 4, 1910. At the same time, gold prices have soared, opening at 127 shillings and 8 pence per ounce.</p>
<p>▲Havas, Riga, 25th: The government of the Republic of Latvia has requested the United States to postpone the payment of war debts due in December, totaling US$148,000. The country has also requested Britain to postpone the payment of two batches of debts due between July and December, each amounting to £37,500.</p>
<h3>Japanese Budget Proposal</h3>
<p>Cabinet Formally Decides</p>
<p>▲ Tokyo Dispatch from the Japan United Press on the 25th: The government cabinet convened at 10:30 AM today and formally decided on the budget for each ministry for the coming year as follows (unit: 1,000 yen): Expenditures: Regular section: 1,357,396. Temporary section: 881,929. Total: 2,239,325. Budget for each ministry: Imperial Household Expenses: 4,500; Ministry of Foreign Affairs: 26,390; Ministry of Home Affairs: 218,409; Ministry of Finance: 474,014; Ministry of the Army: 447,883; Ministry of the Navy: 372,606; Ministry of Justice: 34,480; Ministry of Education: 151,827; Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry: 117,656; Ministry of Commerce and Industry: 13,778; Ministry of Communications: 349,935; Ministry of Colonial Affairs: 27,834. Estimated revenue for the coming year's general account is as follows: Revenue: Regular section: 1,288,311. Temporary section: 951,014. Of which: Ordinary revenue: 54,611. Public bonds: 896,403. Total: 2,239,325. Types of public bonds are as follows: Telephone service bonds: 13,280; Earthquake reconstruction bonds: 18,783; Road bonds: 16,676; Telecommunications service bonds: 7,000.</p>
<p>Tokyo Dispatch from the Japan United Press, 25th: Finance Minister Takahashi delivered a speech at the Kansai Bankers' Association meeting held here today. The gist of his speech is as follows: Some in the world are advocating tax increases due to the revenue shortfall. However, there will be no tax increases during this period. Others worry about the future of the finances due to the issuance of huge amounts of public bonds. However, there are three reasons for issuing such large public bonds: (1) The economic recession at home and abroad has reduced tax revenues. (2) Expenses for the Manchurian Incident and related national defense costs have increased. (3) The so-called "situation relief" expenses. Once the financial world improves, the reduction in revenue can be restored to the state before 1928 in a few years, and the time to revise various taxes can be reached. The Manchurian Incident expenses and national defense costs are not permanent needs. The effect of such a large amount of money for "situation relief" expenses will be seen after three years. Today's large revenue shortfall is a temporary phenomenon. I believe these reasons will disappear. In a few years, the Japanese financial world will return to its original state. The fundamental reason for the current low exchange rate lies in the international political and economic unrest. Avoiding the outflow of capital from countries is an important issue in an era of currency fluctuations. The government has enacted and implemented a law to prevent capital flight. If it is not effective, the law will have to be changed.</p>
<p>▲ Tokyo Dispatch from the Electric Communication, 25th: The Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry held a social gathering at the Tokyo Kaikan yesterday. At the meeting, President Go Seinosuke criticized the government's budget for the coming year, discussing its imbalance and the insecurity of national finances. Minister of the Army Araki, who was present, rose to refute, saying that the speech just now seemed to treat the military as a headquarters for unproductive consumers. One must know that the domestic thought is fluctuating and uneasy, and the movement against capitalism is sweeping the country. In this extremely enthusiastic and ideological crisis, the state finances are merely a reflection of this crisis. To say that the responsibility lies with the government, or even solely with the military, is an insufficient understanding.</p>
<p>▲ Osaka Dispatch from Reuters, 25th: Governor of the Bank of Japan, Hijikata, gave a lecture at a bankers' meeting today, asking the public not to be pessimistic about the future of Japanese finances, but also not to be overly optimistic, as this would lead to speculative fervor. Hijikata also warned against excessive currency inflation, as a sharp rise in prices before the purchasing power of the masses increases would harm the people. Hijikata also advocated the rationalization of industry.</p>
<p>Hindenburg Obeys the Constitution, Refuses Hitler to Form a Dictatorial Cabinet</p>
<h3>Hopes Dashed for the Center Party to Form a Cabinet, German Political Situation Extremely Grave</h3>
<p>▲ Berlin Dispatch from Reuters, 24th: This afternoon, Hitler received a letter from President Hindenburg, politely rejecting his application to form a presidential cabinet. The letter stated that he could not use the power of the president to grant it to the leader of a single party, as such a cabinet would create a one-party dictatorship and intensify the tension among the German people. He would be violating his oath and conscience and could not bear this responsibility. Hitler now blames the president and his advisors for not treating him with sincerity. Goering, Speaker of the Reichstag, declared to journalists today that the president's actions clearly showed that he never intended to authorize Hitler.</p>
<p>▲ Berlin Dispatch from the National News Agency, 24th: After the German President rejected the proposal of the National Socialist Party's Hitler, he asked the leader of the Center Party, Kaas, to try to form a concentrated cabinet. Kaas is currently discussing with key members of his party whether to accept the president's commission. It is reported that he told the president that he would answer on Friday evening whether he would accept the commission. It is also reported that when the German President rejected Hitler's proposal, he expressed hope that Hitler would continue to cooperate with the government. If Hitler wanted to meet, he would be happy to meet and discuss political events. As for Hitler's proposal, it was accompanied by an explanation that he believed a parliamentary cabinet was not entirely impossible, but it could not be formed under the conditions set by the president.</p>
<p>▲ Berlin Dispatch from the National News Agency, 25th: The hope of the Center Party leader Kaas to form a national concentration cabinet is extremely slim. Therefore, it is generally believed that the restoration of a presidential cabinet is almost certain. Currently, what everyone is speculating about is whether the new prime minister will still be Papen or someone else. However, no matter who forms the cabinet at this time, the task will be very difficult, because the National Socialist Party and the Communist Party can form a majority party against the government. It is expected that the new government will soon fail in the parliament. Therefore, many people believe that a general election will be held again soon to break the majority position of the anti-government faction. If a general election is held again, the number of seats lost by the National Socialist Party will certainly exceed the number of seats gained by the Communist Party. If so, it will be easier to form a stable government. However, the business community is still eager to avoid another election campaign to prevent the domestic economic situation from being affected. As for the attitude of the National Socialist Party, it has been firmly decided not to participate in the national concentration cabinet.</p>
<p>▲ Berlin Dispatch from the National News Agency, 25th: Today's newspaper editorials, from the extreme left to the extreme right, all say that the German political situation is extremely serious and very difficult. Although the newspapers have different opinions on whether it is appropriate to organize a national concentration cabinet at this time, or to restore Papen's detached presidential cabinet, none of them can propose a way to establish a stable government. According to the current situation, even if Kaas can unite the Center, National Rights, and People's Parties, and the National Socialist Party insists on Hitler's request to form a cabinet, it is still doubtful whether they will be willing to cooperate with Kaas to occupy a majority of seats in the parliament.</p>
<p>Berlin Dispatch from the National News Agency, 25th: It was officially announced today that the new German parliament will be convened on December 6.</p>
<h3>British and German Foreign Ministers Negotiate Disarmament Conference Issues</h3>
<p>Resumption Date Depends on France's Attitude</p>
<p>▲ Geneva Dispatch from the National News Agency, 25th: British Foreign Secretary Simon and German Foreign Minister Neurath held a final conversation this morning before returning home. Both felt that the resumption date of the disarmament conference was still difficult to predict, and would largely depend on what kind of proposals France made to Germany in the coming week. Chairman Henderson is currently strongly urging all countries to be extremely patient.</p>
<h3>Russo-Polish Non-Aggression Treaty</h3>
<p>Can Be Ratified Next Week</p>
<p>▲ Warsaw Dispatch from the National News Agency, 24th: Polish newspapers have unanimously expressed regret over Romania's refusal to conclude a non-aggression treaty with Soviet Russia. However, they believe that Romania's tough attitude will not harm the harmony between Poland and Soviet Russia, and may even enhance the friendship between the two countries. It was also learned from semi-official sources that the non-aggression treaty between Poland and Soviet Russia and its accompanying documents, such as the arbitration agreement stipulating a four-person public panel, can be ratified at the Moscow conference next Wednesday.</p>

<h3>Japanese Army Plans to Deploy the Sixth Division to Northern Manchuria</h3>
<p>First Attack Ma Zhanshan's Army on the Qiqihar-Keshan Line, then Attack Su Bingwen's Army on the Harbin-Manzhouli Line</p>
<p>Black Dragon River Correspondent: For the sake of convenient command, Ma Zhanshan has set up a general headquarters in Nenjiang County. Most of the troops are concentrated on the Qiqihar-Keshan line. It is estimated that Deng Wenyi's army of about 20,000 men is stationed in Baiquan, and Li Haiqing's army of 15,000 men is between Keshan and Kedu. The two brigades that attacked Datong are in the Aolonggou area. Xu Zihe's army is between Taian Town and Laha Station. It is estimated that there are no less than 80,000 men of the Black Army on the Qiqihar-Keshan line. From the outskirts of Heilongjiang City to Ningnian stations, there is no place that is not occupied by righteous armies. Currently, the armies are preparing winter clothes, and their activities have been slightly quiet in recent days. Ma Zhanshan's plan is to start attacking Heihe before the New Year's Day after the armies' winter clothes are ready. Ammunition for the armies has recently been shipped in large quantities from a certain direction, and each soldier is quite well-supplied. Mergen has a bullet-making factory, which can handle the repair of small-scale military equipment. Each company can have three light machine guns, and the strength has been greatly supplemented compared to before. The "Great Pai Societies" established in each county are all under Ma's command. Except for a few counties such as Longsha, Mulan, Suihua, and Hulan, which are still controlled by the puppet regime, the remaining 30-odd counties in Heilongjiang Province are all under Ma Zhanshan's command. The twenty-odd counties of Bayan, Wangkui, Qingcheng, etc. in eastern Heilongjiang are currently garrisoned by Cai Hongyou, while Tangyuan, Luobei, etc. are defended by Xu Jingde. Therefore, the restoration of Heilongjiang is only in a corner of Longsha. Since this spring, the Japanese army has deployed six or seven thousand troops to Jilin and Heilongjiang. The Second Division, having suffered more than half of its losses, has been transferred to Southern Manchuria, the Murai Brigade has been withdrawn to Korea, and the Kamamura Brigade has been withdrawn to Rehe. Currently, the forces in the Jilin-Heilongjiang area are the Second Division's Hasegawa Brigade, stationed in Nai'an, the South Manchurian Railway Garrison stationed in Changchun, the Fourteenth Division's Matsuki Naoaki, scattered in Heilongjiang, the Hiraga Brigade on the Qiqihar-Keshan line, the Hiramatsu Brigade on the Hulan-Hailun line, and the newly arrived Cavalry Brigade in Laha Town. The Tenth Division's Hirose Battalion Nakamura Brigade is scattered in Harbin and on the Harbin-Changchun line, and another brigade is in the lower reaches of the Songhua River. The Itabashi Mixed Brigade is on the Harbin-Suihua line in Yimianpo and Hailin. The Tenth Division has suffered heavy casualties in several fierce battles with the righteous armies Ding Li, Gong Changhai, and Feng Zhanhai. Originally numbering 16,000, it now has only half that number. The Fourteenth Division's Matsuki Battalion has also lost more than half of its men, having been killed by Ma's army in several battles on the Hulan-Hailun Road this summer. It is estimated that the strength of the Japanese army's two divisions and one mixed brigade is currently less than 20,000 men, and they are scattered in various places, making them weak. When Muto Nobuyoshi first came as the plenipotentiary of the puppet state, he planned to concentrate his forces in Jilin, Changchun, Liaoning, Harbin, and Heilongjiang, abandon the towns, and incite the Chinese to kill each other, then take the opportunity to gather his forces and attack, in order to achieve twice the result with half the effort. However, it has recently been learned that this plan is not suitable for use, because where the Japanese army is not present, although the righteous armies occupy it, they only seek food and clothing and do not engage in other activities, and the soldiers and civilians live in peace with each other. Therefore, Muto does not dare to continue this policy, and plans to conquer by force. However, the matter of sending troops from Japan is currently impossible. The only hope at present is to eliminate the power of Tang Juwu in the eastern border area, and then transfer the Sixth Division north to reinforce them. Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, Koiso, went to Heihe by plane some days ago to convene a military meeting to plan everything. Recently, a part of the South Manchurian Railway Guard has been dispatched from the Siping-Taonan Road to Daan Town on the Taonan-Ang'angxi Road. When the Sixth Division arrives, it will target the Qiqihar-Keshan Road. The Matsuki Division will advance in two directions, one along the railway line and the other bypassing along the Nenjiang grassland, first wanting to attack Ma Zhanshan, then to deal with Su Bingwen and Zhang Dianjiu with all their strength. However, due to the pincer attack of the Japanese army, Tang Juwu has divided his troops into ten groups and scattered them in various places. If the Japanese army moves, they will still advance and recover the lost land. Therefore, the Sixth Division has not yet dared to move. Yesterday, Commander of the Tenth Division, Hirose Hisasuke, went to Changchun to attend the Japanese Kwantung Army military meeting, which was probably also discussing the plan of advance.

<h3>Japanese Army Plans to Attack Rehe</h3>
<p>▲ One Route Attacks Beipiao, One Route Takes Duhei Mayingzi</p>
<p>▲ The Number of Enemy Troops in Jinzhou Increases Suddenly, Intending to Take the Opportunity to Disturb the Border of Rehe</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondent: According to those who have newly arrived in Beiping from Jinzhou, the Japanese staff officer Gu Yuanbao, dispatched from Panxin to Jinzhou, plans to attack Rehe in two directions, one taking Duhei Mayingzi to solve Zhu Jiqing's forces, and using Chinese traitors to harass, and the other occupying Beipiao along the railway, and attacking Chaoyang from the west. Currently, in the Yixian area, vehicles are being requisitioned on a large scale, and civilian houses are being occupied, and there will be action. At noon on the 12th, a Japanese plane circled over Chaoyang for reconnaissance for more than ten minutes before heading east. The third son of the Prince of Heichengzi, Xi Zisheng, secretly went to Changchun to join the Japanese this spring, colluding with Huerha Wang Shouqi Wang and others in various banners of Inner Mongolia. In August, he colluded with many of his remnants in the Beizhen Fuxin area, using the excuse of recruiting cavalry to protect the banner, and secretly received assistance from the Japanese, preparing for a major riot. The bombing of Sanbaoyingzi last time was definitely guided by Xi Zisheng, taking advantage of the opportunity. At Jinjiatun Airport, there are thirteen combat reconnaissance aircraft, which are flying and performing there from time to time. There are more than fifteen Japanese railway guards at the station. At the Japanese army headquarters south of the station, there are fifty Japanese infantrymen with fifteen mortars. Within the enemy regimental headquarters of the Ji Shichang Hutong in Jinzhou, there are ninety infantrymen. South of the drum tower in the city, there is an enemy garrison headquarters, stationed with thirty to fifty Japanese soldiers. In and out of Jinzhou city, there are approximately three hundred enemies in total, with forty or so machine guns, mortars, and heavy artillery. On the 12th, the National Salvation Army attacked Jinzhou Station and Jinjiatun, making contact with more than one hundred Japanese soldiers. After two hours of fighting, they withdrew to their original defenses. The Japanese army committed terrible burning and killing in the Banjiata Xinmulinzi Weibashao area. The Japanese are using Chinese traitors Li Shoulin (Ershijiazi, Chaoyang) and Hong Bin (Baishangou) to provide food, clothing, and ammunition, and to collect bandits, intending to disturb the border of Rehe. The puppet state is currently implementing a forced conscription system in order to eliminate the various righteous armies, estimating four thousand men from first-class counties, three thousand men from second-class counties, and two thousand men from third-class counties. All expenses for conscripts, including monthly salaries and gold tickets, are raised by adding taxes to the land tax. On the 8th, two trains of Japanese soldiers arrived in Jin County from the east, estimated to be about three hundred infantrymen, all stationed in Jinjiatun barracks. Wang Delin's troops are in the area of the Middle East Railway's Harbin-Suihua line and the Jilin-Dunhua line. In late October, Zhao Yazhou's troops divided into two groups and besieged Qianjinzai. Because the enemy transferred a large number of reinforcements, the righteous armies retreated. The enemy massacred more than two thousand villagers near the coal mines. (22nd)</p>
<h3>Xu Yongchang Returns to Taiyuan from Wuhan</h3>
<p>▲ Xu Discusses the Results of Meeting with Chiang Kai-Shek, Which Are Satisfactory</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondent: The Chairman of the Shanxi Provincial Government, Xu Yongchang, was summoned by Chiang Kai-shek to Wuhan and then to Nanjing to discuss important official matters. It has been nearly a month since then. Now Mr. Xu has already left Wuhan on the 19th with his secretary Pu Chaoqian, heading north, arriving in Shijiazhuang on the evening of the 21st, and taking the Zhengtai early train back to Taiyuan this (22nd) morning at 7 o'clock. The Provincial Government received the news this morning and immediately notified the departments and bureaus to go to the station to welcome him. From 3:00 PM onwards, those who arrived at the station to make arrangements were a military band, more than thirty policemen, a company of soldiers, and more than ten military police, waiting to welcome him. The Director of Bandit Suppression, Yang Aiyuan, the co-director Sun Chu, the Garrison Commander Rong Honglu, the Military Police Commander Li Runfa, the Public Security Bureau Chief Wang Xifu, and the heads of the departments and bureaus also arrived on the platform to greet him. Around 4:00 PM, the train entered the station, and Mr. Xu got off the train with Pu Chaoqian, then took a car back to his private residence. According to a statement released by Mr. Xu, he had several meetings with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in Wuhan regarding the supplies for the Shanxi garrison, and he had also discussed Shanxi's party affairs, but the specific methods had not yet been decided. The current situation of the Central Government's bandit suppression is very good, and the government forces have repeatedly won victories, and it is estimated that it can be cleared up soon. Xu continued that this trip to Wuhan was very satisfactory. It is heard that after resting at his private residence, Mr. Xu went to the Pacification Commissioner's Office to visit Yan Xishan, reporting on the trip to Wuhan and the recent situation in Nanjing and Shanghai.

<h3>The 19th Route Army Advances into Northern Fujian</h3>
<p>The Provincial Capital Newspapers Resumed Publication on the 22nd</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondent: The two groups of Red Bandits, Zhu De and Lin Biao, who invaded northern Fujian, looted a large amount of grain and winter clothing, and then withdrew from Jianyang and Jiangle to Shaowu and Guangze, as previously reported. Now the bandits have withdrawn from Shaowu and Guangze to Jianning and Taining. As of the 18th, they have retreated from Jianning and Taining through Fengling Guankeng to Lichuan and Nanfeng in eastern Jiangxi. There are no major Red Bandit forces in northern Fujian. Only scattered local bandits are emerging and harassing intermittently. However, due to the limited military strength, the government forces are still concentrated in Jianyang and Jiangle and have not yet entered Shaowu and Guangze. For this reason, the Pacification Commissioner's Office specially transferred the 61st Division's Zhang Yan Battalion from Quanzhou and the 78th Division's Yun Yinglin Battalion from Zhangzhou, about 4,000 troops, to the province. The Yun Battalion is stationed in the eastern, western, and northern suburbs of Fuzhou, guarding the provincial capital. The Zhang Battalion is stationed in Yanping, so that the four battalions of Liu Heding's 56th Division: Liu Shangzhi, Gui Zhenyuan, Jiang Yan, and Zhou Zhibin, can track and pursue them. It is currently heard that the headquarters of the Liu Division will be moved from Yanping to Jianou soon, and the troops stationed in Yanping have been successively heading to Jian City. According to a telegram from the 20th, the troops on the Jianyang front have defeated the local bandits in Nakou and Jieshou, Shaowu, and are advancing into Shaowu territory. In addition, after the Zhang Yan Battalion was transferred to the province, there is only the Zhang Li Battalion in Quanzhou. The remnants of Chen Guo, together with the local bandits Zhang Xiongnan, Zhan Fangzhen, and Tu Youqing, totaling more than 2,000 men, are rampaging in the three counties of Anxi, Yongchun, and Nan'an, extorting money, intercepting goods, and are very rampant. The Pacification Commissioner's Office yesterday ordered the Supplemental Regiment of the 19th Route Army, Tan Qixiu, currently stationed in the Putian and Xianyou Counties, to enter Yongchun and Anxi to cooperate with the Zhang Li Battalion in suppressing them. The Second Brigade of the Provincial Defense Army, Xiao Shuxuan, currently stationed in Fuqing and Yongtai Counties, is taking over the defense of Putian and Xianyou.</p>
<p>The newspapers in the provincial capital were ordered by the Public Security Bureau to stop publication for three days because the "Seeking Truth Newspaper" published a news report that Zhang Yan's Battalion was stationed in Yanping, which was considered inappropriate. They unanimously declared a suspension of publication starting from the 18th as a form of resistance, as previously reported. On the 19th, Jiang Guangnai specially summoned representatives of the newspapers to speak at the Pacification Commissioner's Office, stating that during the bandit suppression period, the movement of troops was very important and should be kept secret. Once disclosed, the war would be greatly affected, and strict measures had to be taken. He persuaded the newspapers to resume publication immediately and not to misunderstand. The newspapers have decided to publish as usual on the 22nd, but will not publish any military news. The "Min Bao," run by the Japanese, is taking this opportunity to publish military news on a large scale for days, and even deliberately spreading rumors to attract readers' attention.

<h3>A Bird's-Eye View of the Guangxi Militia</h3>
<p>Nanning Correspondence: The Guangxi Militia has achieved remarkable results. Therefore, the process of its management and its transformations are worth reporting to the nation. A general account is provided below, as it is also of concern to those involved in militia affairs.</p>
<p>The Organization of the Militia: In the past, the Guangxi Militia lacked organization and training, and its strength was extremely weak. Around 1929 and 1930, due to turmoil within the provincial government, Li Zongren, the Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth Army Group, and Bai Chongxi, the Deputy Commander-in-Chief, felt that the province was still troubled by bandits and the populace was scattered. They knew that actively training the militia was essential for pacifying the region. Therefore, they dispatched personnel to supervise and train the militia in various counties, engaging in pacification work. Ultimately, the entire province was stabilized thanks to the efforts of the militia. In the autumn of 1930, the provincial government established the Guangxi Militia General Command in Nanning, with Bai Chongxi as the General Commander and Liang Hansong as the Deputy Commander. They immediately formulated the Provisional Regulations for the Organization of the Militia and, based on the previous administrative divisions, made adjustments to their jurisdictions, dividing them into twelve districts. Each district was headed by a Commander and a Deputy Commander to supervise the militia affairs of the various counties. Each county established a Militia Headquarters, with the County Magistrate serving concurrently as the Commander. The Deputy Commanders were to be elected by the County Council from three local individuals with renowned reputation and military knowledge, and their appointments were subject to approval by the General Command. As for the standing troops in each county, the number of troops was determined based on the local security situation and financial capacity, varying from one to three troops per county. The organizational system was as follows: under the General Command was the District Command, under the District Command was the County Headquarters, and under the County Headquarters were the standing troops. In January of this year, General Commander Bai considered the militia to be a part of the provincial administration and should be managed by the provincial government. After several meetings and discussions, the Guangxi Militia Regulations and the Organizational Regulations for the Provincial Government Militia Affairs Office were established. Subsequently, at the end of April, the Militia General Command was abolished, and all militia affairs were taken over by the provincial government starting from May 1st. Militia affairs were managed by the provincial government and were reorganized more thoroughly. The improved aspects are as follows: (1) Dividing the entire province into six militia districts (Nanning, Wuzhou, Baise, Longzhou, Guilin, Liuzhou). (2) Expanding the organization of the District Command. (3) Increasing the special task force of the District Command. (4) The expenses of the District Command, County Headquarters, special task force, standing troops, and trained reserve troops are all to be paid by the provincial treasury. (5) All excessive taxes and levies collected for the militia since 1930 are to be stopped to alleviate the burden on the people. (6) Personnel at all levels should be from the same county or neighboring counties as a principle. (7) The system of electing Deputy Commanders is abolished, and they are to be appointed by the government instead. (8) Reducing the standing troops and focusing on the reserve troops, with a plan to complete training in ten phases over five years. (9) Reserve militia members are to be responsible for defense and maintaining public order. (10) Militia members are to devote themselves to cultivation and development to boost production. (11) Providing supplementary education to the militia to equip them with basic civic knowledge. (12) Using the militia as the main force for suppressing bandits. The provincial government has been gradually implementing the above items. This is a general overview of the organizational changes of the Guangxi Militia.</p>
<p>▲ Militia Training: The Guangxi Militia is divided into three types: standing troops, reserve troops, and rear reserve troops. The standing troops are conscripted and trained from qualified young men within the county. The reserve troops are formed by militiamen who have completed their training in the standing troops and have been discharged. The rear reserve troops are composed of all conscriptable young men outside of the standing and reserve troops, and they are organized as much as possible. Regarding the organization, the standing troops are divided into three types: Type A, each troop has three platoons and nine squads, with one troop leader, three troop deputies, nine squad leaders, and eighty-one militiamen; Type B, each troop has two platoons and six squads, with one troop leader, one troop deputy, six squad leaders, and sixty-six militiamen; Type C, each troop has one troop leader, one troop deputy, four squad leaders, and forty-four militiamen. The organization of the reserve troops and rear reserve troops is the same as that of the standing troops, but the rear reserve troops are primarily organized as Type A. The conscription of militiamen for the standing troops is carried out by the County Militia Headquarters two months before the previous standing troops are discharged. Based on the total number of young men in the rear reserve troops reported by each district, the number of militiamen to be conscripted for the current period is appropriately allocated to each district, and the district heads and rear reserve troop leaders are responsible for sending the required number of conscripts on time. After receiving the conscription order, the district chiefs and rear reserve troop leaders should prioritize the conscription of those from households with relatively good livelihoods and more brothers from the rear reserve troops under their jurisdiction. Regarding training: (1) The training of the standing troops is supervised by the County Militia Commander and training officers, who instruct the troop leaders and deputies to implement the training according to the syllabuses and technical schedules issued by the provincial government. The District Command will also send personnel to inspect regularly and report to the provincial government. The training period was previously set at four months but is now set at six months. Upon completion of the training, they are immediately discharged. (2) Training of the reserve troops: After the discharge of the standing troops, the district teams and village chiefs will register the discharged militiamen in the district and form them into reserve troops. If there are not enough for a troop, they will be temporarily trained as a platoon or a squad. After the training of the teams, the County Militia Headquarters will select a date and suitable location each quarter to train for one week. During this training period, attention will also be paid to the methods of joint defense, national humiliation reminders, defense work, and guidance on land reclamation, road construction, and tree planting. (3) Training of the rear reserve troops is also conducted by the County Headquarters, which sends training officers and troop leaders and deputies to gather and train in phases. It is estimated that in the first half of this year, 444 teams of standing troops were trained, and the number of reserve troop training teams was equal to the standing troops. After the establishment of the Militia Affairs Office in July, the implementation focused on reducing the number of standing troops and paying attention to the training of the rear reserve troops in order to increase effectiveness with provincial funding. Therefore, only 76 teams of standing troops Type A, 112 teams of Type B, and 96 teams of Type C were formed, with a total of 15,960 militiamen. As for the training plan for the rear reserve troops, it is planned to organize all young men in the province, approximately 3 million, into rear reserve troops. Each team consists of 90 people, so over 33,000 teams should be formed. Twenty percent will be trained each year, which is over 6,600 teams. This period will train 3,300 teams. For every five teams, two training officers will be assigned, requiring over 600 training officers in total, and this is already underway.</p>
<p>▲ Personnel Training: There is a great need for talented people to train the militia, such as officers in the district and county headquarters, troop leaders and deputies in the standing troops, and training officers. Military specialists are needed. In addition to assigning graduates from the guard cadre training program held last year and transferring military officers, the provincial government still feels that there are not enough talented people to allocate. They are now continuing to train these militia personnel and have decided to assign high school students from the province (since high school students in the province receive military training) to carry out militia training work.</p>
<p>▲ Militia Funding: Previously, the funding for the Militia General Command and District Commands was provided by the provincial treasury. The salaries for the District special task force were mostly raised by the counties. The expenses for the County Headquarters and standing troops were entirely borne by the local authorities, resulting in increased taxes and levies in various counties, making it difficult for the people to bear. Since July of this year, after the Militia Affairs were taken over by the province, all regular expenses for the Provincial Militia Affairs Office, District Commands, County Headquarters, standing troops, and rear reserve troops are now provided by the provincial treasury. It is estimated that the annual expenditure for the Militia Affairs Office is over 55,900 yuan, over 298,100 yuan for the District Commands, over 378,000 yuan for the special task force, over 599,000 yuan for the County Headquarters, over 1,481,500 yuan for the standing troops, and 480,000 yuan for the rear reserve troops. Adding one-fourth of the provincial and district reserve funds, the total annual expenditure is approximately over 3.9 million yuan. However, the reserve funds for the counties are still retained from the militia funds prior to 1930 (those not increased due to militia affairs) or are to be raised separately. After the militia funding was changed to be provided by the province, all excessive taxes and levies in various localities were abolished, and the people were relieved of a heavy burden.</p>
<p>▲ Implementing Mass Education: Since Guangxi decided to actively train the militia and rear reserve troops, nearly ten thousand young men have been trained each year. The Education Department believes that these rear reserve troops are the elite of the province's population. If supplementary education can be provided during their training period, then after five years, all young men in the province will have basic civic knowledge, and there will be no illiterate people in the province. Mass education can be expected to be widespread. The Education Department has drafted measures for implementing supplementary education for the militia and rear reserve troops, which were submitted to the Provincial Government Committee for resolution and approval. Detailed rules for implementation are being drafted, funds are being raised, textbooks are being compiled and printed, and implementation is scheduled for the first semester of 1933.</p>
<p>▲ Militia Land Reclamation Work: The provincial government believes that the role of managing the militia is not only to pacify the region but also a basic method for organizing and training the masses. The militia should bear a great responsibility for developing agriculture. It was previously stipulated that the County Militia Headquarters should supervise the standing troops to engage in land reclamation work in addition to their training. Currently, each county militia has a militia forest or a militia farm. The land reclamation work of the Yongning County militia has been the most successful. The land reclamation work of the militia in other counties has also achieved considerable results. Recently, the provincial government has planned to have the County Headquarters select areas and conscript rear reserve troops in phases to engage in land reclamation. If this plan is implemented, the province's wasteland will be completely reclaimed in a few years, and the province's agriculture will develop day by day.</p>
<p>▲ The Pacification Strength of the Militia: Since Guangxi began managing the militia in 1930, the public security of the counties has been maintained by the militia. The militia has also contributed significantly to the work of suppressing bandits and communists. Recently, the capture of the communist leader Wei Baqun was due to the militia's interception, which exhausted Wei's forces and prevented him from escaping. Furthermore, the communist leader Lan Zhiren led over a thousand men in the Lingyun and Fengshan counties and was killed by the militia, and his remaining troops were completely annihilated. The bandit suppression achievements in other counties have also been remarkable. Therefore, most counties in the province currently do not need to station troops, and the local area is peaceful and bandits have disappeared. It can be seen that the strength of the militia is no less than that of the army.</p>
<p>Looking at the above situation, the Guangxi Militia is not only unmatched by militias elsewhere but also pioneers the use of the militia to promote political and construction endeavors. Therefore, it is worthy of recording.</p>

<h3>The Pacification of the Mongolian Banner by Zhangjia</h3>
<p>— Li Jianzhang</p>
<p>The Central Government appointed Zhangjia to pacify the Mongolian banner some time ago. However, the establishment has been delayed for several months because the organizational regulations of the Pacification Envoy Office have not been officially promulgated. Today's Central Daily News reports that "the organizational regulations of the Mongolian Banner Pacification Envoy Office were passed by the Executive Yuan's 77th meeting yesterday and will be promulgated soon. It is also said that Zhu Yuqiao, Zhang Xueliang, and others have repeatedly telegraphed Wutai Mountain to invite Zhangjia to Beijing to discuss important plans. Zhangjia is preparing to descend the mountain at the beginning of next month, go to Beijing to take office, establish the office, and start working. After that, he will depart to pacify the Mongolian Banner, in order to live up to the heavy trust placed in him by the National Government." Jianzhang believes that this matter is of great importance, so he will write an article to discuss it from his own perspective.</p>
<p>The Mongolian banners refer to the three banners of the Batu Setkiltu League, the twenty-three banners of the Chechen Khan League, the twenty banners of the Tushetu Khan League, the twenty-four banners of the Sain Noyan Khan League, the nineteen banners of the Zasagtu Khan League, the nineteen banners of the Sayin Zhiyahatu League, the eight banners of the Hulunbuir League, the five banners of the Tannu Uriankhai League, the ten banners of the Qing Setkiltu League, the ten banners of the Unen Zukhutu League, the one banner of the Ik Mingan, the two banners of the Eastern and Western Butha, the one banner of Alashan,</p>
<p>the one banner of Ajina, the twenty-one banners of the Khoshut League, the four banners of the Torghut League, the two banners of the Choros League, the one banner of the Hoit League, the one banner of the Khalkha League, the six banners of the Ulan Dabush League, the seven banners of the Ijas League, the one banner of the Western Tumed, the eight banners of the Chahar League, the ten banners of the Kelingol League, the thirteen banners of the Josutu League, the seven banners of the Jirim League, and the ten banners of the Jelemi League, totaling twenty leagues and 241 banners. They are distributed in parts or all of Outer Mongolia, Rehe, Chahar, Suiyuan, Ningxia, Qinghai, Gansu, Xinjiang, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, and other provinces. They have a large population and cannot be underestimated. However, since the revolution, officials have been preoccupied with internal strife and have not paid attention to border defense. In name, they are all under the banner of the Blue Sky with a White Sun, but in reality, it is each for themselves, and they do not interact with each other. The Mongols do not know the Central Government, and the Central Government forgets the Mongols. The separation between the two sides and the disappearance of affection, and the fact that most Mongols still follow the Qing system and honor the Qing titles, not knowing who rules the Central Plains, cannot be entirely blamed on the Mongols' lack of enlightenment. If this continues, then the united nation hoped for by the late Premier, that is, the entire Chinese nation, cannot be formed, and the country cannot be established on a rock-solid foundation.</p>
<p>Moreover, during the Tsarist era, Russia regarded Outer Mongolia as meat on its plate. Taking advantage of the revolution in the Central Plains, it incited the Living Buddha of Outer Mongolia to seize the opportunity to declare independence. In order to appease the situation, the Central Government signed the Sino-Russian-Mongolian Agreement in 1915, allowing it autonomy. Later, as the Russian chaos intensified, the Mongols could not bear the harassment. In 1919, they abolished their autonomy and returned power to the Central Government. Two years later, the White Party General Ungern-Sternberg, unable to achieve his goals in Russia, plotted to take Urga and captured the Living Buddha. Shortly thereafter, Soviet Russia sent the Red Army into Mongolia, driving out the White Party. In 1924, it again helped the Mongols declare independence and establish a communist Soviet Republic. At that time, the Red Army of Red Russia, although ostensibly withdrawing, still had real power in the hands of the Third International. Although this independence of Outer Mongolia was due to a small number of Tatar Mongols being anesthetized by the red poison and unknowingly poisoning themselves, the enlightened people of that country deeply knew that this independence was not beneficial to the entire Mongolian nation. Earlier, Yapon Dunsan and others upheld the late Premier's principles, organized the Kuomintang, protected the state religion, and advocated for national self-determination. Because the Mongol race is primarily the Ergene race, which they believe to be descendants of Genghis Khan, with a population of over three million, accounting for more than two-thirds of all Outer Mongols, Yapon Dunsan was a shining example in this banner. The remaining one million people belong to the Tatar race, which Soviet Russia relies on to promote communism and use as a tool to control Outer Mongolia. The difference in numbers is so vast, and the communism is not the automatic choice of the majority of Mongols. It is clear that the red government cannot be permanently established. However, Red Russia relied on the power of the Third International, erased everything, and willfully went its own way. It denigrated religion, recklessly promoted communism, and burned down the Great Temple of Urga, massacring ten thousand believers. The leader of the Kuomintang, Yapon Dunsan, was also killed because of this. As a result, although there were many people without a leader, it was temporarily difficult to achieve their goals. The communist elements were overjoyed and said, "We have no enemy!" Thus, they were unscrupulous and did whatever they wanted. They took advantage of their victory and had a tendency to expand beyond the six leagues and 111 banners of Outer Mongolia and engage in internal aggression. This is the crisis in the northern Mongolian banner, and also the general outline of the red disaster that is being suffered.</p>
<p>We turn our attention to the east. Last year, the violent Japanese invaded and occupied our three provinces, and the ten banners of the Jirim League in western Liaoning and the eight banners of the Hulunbuir League in western Heilongjiang have temporarily succumbed to the Japanese invaders and are no longer ours. In addition, Rehe is a crucial hub in the Northeast and the gateway to North China. Before the September 18th Incident, although its situation was not as important as Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, now that the three provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang have fallen into the hands of the enemy, the importance of Rehe is no longer comparable to the past. Moreover, from the enemy's perspective, if they gain Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang but do not plan for Rehe, it will eventually become a hidden danger. Once there is a conflict with Russia, if our country rises up to recover its lost territories, it will be attacked from both sides, putting us at a disadvantage militarily. Therefore, before the enemy gains Rehe, it will be like a thorn in their back, and they will not be able to fully enjoy the benefits of the three provinces. If they can combine Rehe and the three provinces into one region, they can not only secure the three provinces and avoid being threatened from both sides, but also cut off our path to recover our lost territories. Furthermore, they can turn around and threaten our Beijing and Tianjin, and then invade the Central Plains. Our Beijing and Tianjin are under the pressure of Rehe, the Shanhai Pass, and both land and sea, and will be unable to do anything, as if empty and unreal. If Beijing and Tianjin fall, then North China is in danger. If North China is in danger, then the entire country will no longer have peaceful days. Survival is in the hands of others, and a decision can be made without divination. That is why Japan's discussion of Manchuria and Mongolia, and the scope of the Mongolian part of the original Manchuria and Mongolia policy, which was limited to the Jirim League, has gradually expanded to the entire territory of Rehe. Now, although the previous sheep has been lost, the pen must be urgently repaired to prevent the violent invaders from entering the house and reaching the hall. However, the Mongols are ignorant, lack a sense of nation, and do not have a good relationship with the Central Government. It is easy for villains to take advantage of this. According to a Shenyang telegram from the Hualian News Agency on the 19th of this month, "Japanese rogue groups, under the secret orders of the Kwantung Army, are going to various places to incite and lure the idle Mongolian people living in the three northeastern provinces. Yesterday, they held a Mongolian conference in Sujiatun. The chairman was a Japanese rogue. The resolutions and declarations were official documents drafted by the Japanese military. The contents roughly stated, 'The independence of Manchuria is due to the self-determination of 30 million Chinese people. Otherwise, the 700,000 to 1 million Mongolian people will surely suffer extermination. We hope that the League of Nations will not blame Japan and will support the puppet Manchuria,' etc. The people who attended the meeting did not know what they were doing and only wanted to get some travel expenses. After the meeting, they dispersed like birds and beasts. The Japanese then sent a telegram to the League of Nations in the name of the Mongolian people, boasting that the Mongolian people also support 'Manchuria.'" The Japanese's painstaking efforts can be seen in this glimpse. At the same time, they are also gathering a large army to press on the border of Rehe and secretly dispatching spies to transmit military information. According to the latest news from the Guowen News Agency, "According to people from Rehe, Japanese secret agents are densely deployed within Rehe. Recently, six people were captured by the righteous army of Li Shiru, and they have all been detained but not shot. They have also dispatched a large number of women, under the guise of living abroad, to travel between Chifeng and Chaoyang to secretly communicate information. The Japanese military has also gathered a large force at the Chaoyang headquarters, building fortifications and guarding them strictly. Initially, there were only a thousand people, but in the past few days, they have doubled, totaling more than 2,000 people. According to the captured spies, this force is intended to invade Rehe next spring and disrupt Beijing and Tianjin. This is sufficient proof of the urgency of Rehe's defense."</p>
<p>The six leagues and 111 banners of Outer Mongolia have a population of 4.5 million and occupy over 700,000 square li. They have broken away from our country and become a vassal of Red Russia. The ten banners of the Jirim League in western Liaoning and the eight banners of the Hulunbuir League in western Heilongjiang have also temporarily succumbed to Japan. What remains is not even half of the original number of banners. In addition, the dregs under the protection of Red Russia intend to invade south, and the newly emerging Japanese military閥 is vigorously advancing west. It is feared that in a few years, these remaining less than half of the Mongolian compatriots will not be able to jointly carry the national flag of the Blue Sky with a White Sun. This is true of China's current situation. It is essential for the future of the country that the Mongolian Banner be pacified. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Fengxian</h3>
<p>▲ Folk Education Center Opens Exhibition of Local Cloth: The Folk Education Center in Nanqiao Township of this county originally scheduled the local cloth exhibition to last for three days. However, due to requests from all sides, it has been extended for seven days. Starting yesterday, the Shanghai Children's Propaganda Group was invited to Fengxian to screen the history of the War of Resistance Against Japan to enhance the festive atmosphere. There are over 6,700 items on display, a dazzling array that is truly a feast for the eyes. Among the various types of cloth, the "Sunset Glow," "Well-Field Auspicious Snow," "Double Bean Red Seeds," and "Saithe Bamboo Cloth Dragon Silk Yarn" collected by Yang Zhichao of Zhuangxing Township in the Eighth District are the most outstanding. Other items, such as the various types of Serge from the Third District, the Zhongshan Seven-Star Cloth from the Fourth District, and the Bamboo Fence Palindrome Cloth from the First District, are of excellent quality. Even imported goods cannot compete with them. The Zhuangxing button cloth presented by Wang Lanyan and Diao Qianbo is a famous product of the town a hundred years ago, and its antique charm is even more rare. Currently, in order to encourage production, the association has invited experts to give awards at the event to leave a memorial. At the same time, it has also been decided to open a local cloth store in Nanqiao Township to facilitate sales.</p>
<h3>Kunshan</h3>
<p>▲ Robbers Captured in Broad Daylight: Xu Yicun, a farmer from Wujia Weir in Zhangpu Township, and Chen Chunrong were sailing a boat full of rough rice to the town to sell. On the way, they suddenly encountered six robber boats with over thirty bandits on board, who blocked their path and boarded their boat to rob them. Xu and others shouted for help. Upon hearing the news, over a hundred farmers from the area quickly gathered with weapons and sailed to encircle and capture the robbers. Because they were outnumbered, the farmers captured twelve bandits and three robber boats. They were then sent to the Zhangpu Public Security Branch. After questioning by Chief Wang, because the case involved robbery in broad daylight, he wrote a document and sent the twelve bandits and the robber boats to the city yesterday, who were then transferred to the county government for legal processing.</p>
<h3>Taicang</h3>
<p>▲ Minor Dispute During Relief Distribution: The county's Disaster Relief Association distributed relief funds at the township offices in each district on the 21st. Huang Bingxun, the chief of Xijiao Township in the First District, caused complaints from the disaster victims due to uneven distribution. Huang denied the rumors and changed the distribution to late at night. Unexpectedly, in the chaotic and crowded atmosphere, a man named Ling Wenshu was severely injured in a fight. As a result, the crowd rose up to condemn him and detained Chief Huang. Five relief tickets belonging to deceased township residents were found in Huang's pocket on the spot. The crowd accused the township chief of corruption and dragged Huang to the Public Security Bureau to request a ruling.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>The Case of Chen Duxiu Still Requires Investigation: After the Ministry of Justice ordered the High Court to handle the case of Chen Duxiu and Peng Shuzhi, the High Court sent Prosecutor Zhu Jun to Beijing to investigate. Because the evidence was incomplete, the investigation and trial have not yet been completed. Prosecutor Zhu is now scheduled to go to Beijing again on the 28th to investigate. According to reports, the case will be transferred to the Criminal Division of the same court for public prosecution and trial according to law after the files are received and the investigation is completed.</p>
<p>▲ Suicide by Poisoning Due to Family Quarrel: Ge Shouyuan, residing at No. 471, Huqiu Main Street, committed suicide by swallowing opium at the Yuandong Hotel in the city after arguing with his wife. He was discovered yesterday (the 25th) and sent to Guangmin Hospital for treatment. Qian Genbao, residing at No. 147, Tianku Front, drank a large bowl of kerosene at 1:00 p.m. on the 25th due to family stimulation. His wife discovered this and called for a doctor to treat him. His life is in great danger.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>▲ The entire county is divided into districts for joint defense. The county government, recognizing the current winter defense period and the repeated occurrence of theft cases in urban and rural areas, urgently emphasizes the need for strict attention to local defense. Yesterday, it specially convened the heads of public security, waterway police, district defense corps, and chambers of commerce to hold a winter defense meeting. The following resolutions were made: ㈠ During the winter defense period, the entire county will be divided into six districts, each responsible for its own area. It is stipulated that the first joint defense district consists of the first and second districts, the second joint defense district consists of the third, thirteenth, and fourteenth districts, the third joint defense district consists of the fourth and seventeenth districts, the fourth joint defense district consists of the fifth, fifteenth, and sixteenth districts, the fifth joint defense district consists of the sixth, seventh, and eighth districts, and the sixth joint defense district consists of the ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth districts. Each joint defense district will organize its own joint defense district committee and report it to the county for record. (二) Implement household registration checks. Each joint defense district will conduct checks on makeshift shelters, boats, travelers, and workshops at any time and place. ㈢ During the winter defense period, the setting off of firecrackers is strictly prohibited. The county government will issue a public notice.</p>
<p>▲ Request to reduce telephone expenses in the four rural districts. During the county chief conference, Du Xizhen, chief of the eighth district, and others proposed that telephone charges in the four rural districts were higher than those of commercial companies, while the sound quality was unclear, not as clear as that of commercial companies. The burden on subscribers was unbearable. It was resolved that the county government should forward a request to the Construction Department to reduce charges. Yesterday, the county government forwarded the request with a statement of the facts.</p>
<p>▲ Resolution of the Wuxi-Chengjiang Automobile Dispute. Thirty-two small automobile companies in this county, including Huaxing, Fuji, and Rongtai, were forced to suspend operations, cutting off their livelihoods. They sent representatives Shi Qinglin, Shi Degao, Qian Meichun, and Zheng Xiamin to the provincial capital to petition the provincial party headquarters, provincial government, Construction Department, and Civil Affairs Department. The result was very satisfactory. The Construction Department's Directive No. 1093 was received the day before yesterday, stating, "Received and noted. It is necessary to restrict traffic on the northern section of the Wuxi-Chengjiang Road, which is under repair. According to the previous report, the magistrates of Wuxi and Jiangyin counties should be instructed to direct the heads of the construction bureaus of their respective counties to jointly formulate measures that take into account both engineering and transportation, and handle the matter impartially." At the same time, the county government received instructions from Director Dong of the Construction Office, ordering him to immediately supervise the Construction Bureau to handle the matter impartially. After receiving the order, County Magistrate Chen immediately instructed the Construction Bureau to consult with the Jiangyin Construction Bureau and handle the matter impartially. Director Xiao of the Construction Bureau, after receiving the order, took engineer Zhang Mingou by car to inspect the road work on the Wuxi-Chengjiang Road yesterday (the day before yesterday) afternoon and met with Yang Pinsun, Director of the Chengjiang Construction Bureau, to discuss solutions. Today (the 25th) morning, the Jiangyin County Government convened a business-government discussion meeting and resolved that, starting immediately, eight small cars would be allowed to operate first, with each car issued a flag by the Construction Bureau as proof. After the road repairs are completed, all cars will operate as usual. The long-standing dispute has now been resolved.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>▲ Grave robbery occurs in the western suburbs. The tomb of Tang Jun's family near Lushu Bridge in the western suburbs of Wuyi County was recently used to bury his daughter's coffin. Unexpectedly, it was coveted by thieves. On the night of the 23rd, the coffin inside the tomb was stolen and pried open, and all the gold jewelry was stolen. The daughter's corpse and clothing were left scattered on the ground. On the morning of the 24th, passersby discovered it and were taken to investigate by the nearby police precinct. The family was notified to collect the body and a report was made requesting the arrest of the perpetrators.</p>
<p>▲ Robbery and assault in Mengcheng. Sun Qiankai, a farmer in Dazhuangli Village, Mengcheng, the 19th district of Wuyi County, was suddenly robbed the day before yesterday. A robber stole an old-fashioned breech-loading gun and silver dollars. The victim, Sun Qiankai, was burned by the robbers and suffered injuries all over his body. On the 24th, he was carried to Wujin Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>▲ Reasons for the Increase in Salt Prices in Changyinsha. The price of salt in the Changyinsha district of Nantong is more than twice as high as that in the other seventeen districts. The county government submitted a request to the Transportation Office for a reduction to ensure uniform treatment with other districts in the county. The Transportation Office replied that Changyinsha had been designated as a special area by the Salt Affairs Administration, increasing the tax rate. Sales were combined for Huai and Zhejiang, without regional divisions, specifically to serve as a barrier for the Huai coast and a shield for the Zhejiang coast, to prevent encroachment on sales. Moreover, because the area is in Jiangnan, salt boats must cross the river, increasing transportation costs. The selling price is naturally higher than on the Tong coast. This is a general order, making it difficult to approve a reduction.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>The Defense Corps Arrests a Major Criminal. Lu Guanying, instructor of the first squad of the first district defense corps in Jintong Bridge, east of the city, led seven corps members on patrol the night before last (the 22nd) at around 10:00 PM. While patrolling, they spotted a figure ahead near Yong'an Bridge. Instructor Lu followed, and in front of Yangjia Village in Fangjia Pond, they saw a woman standing motionless in the light. Suddenly, she disappeared. The group suspected it was a ghost. They then saw a man in Yangjia Temple, looking flustered. They immediately pursued and apprehended him. He confessed his name as Meng Fanglin, a tailor. On the morning of December 31st of last year, he attempted robbery in the Chejing River area and killed a woman, who was stabbed four times in the face. He then fled to Shanghai to work as a laborer. He also had accomplices named Chen Linbao and Yang Hongchao. Subsequently, Chen and Yang were also arrested, and bullets were found in Meng's home. All were handed over to the first district corps on the 23rd and transferred to the county for legal proceedings.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Patriotic merchant sells property to help the righteous army. A merchant in Yuhang Street, Yuyao (who wishes to remain anonymous, hence his name is withheld), about 30 years old, has made a living selling cigarettes. After more than ten years of savings, he acquired fields and houses worth about 1,500 yuan. Recently, seeing reports of the Northeast Volunteer Army bravely defending the country in the freezing cold, he was deeply moved. A few days ago, he sold all his property for 1,500 yuan, using 500 yuan to start a small business and donating the remaining 1,000 yuan to the Northeast Volunteer Army. This gentleman came to Ningbo from Yuyao by train yesterday (the 23rd), entrusted to Mr. Weng, a railway employee, to introduce him to Ni Dezhao, an official of the Aid to the Righteous Army Savings Association, for forwarding to the Northeast. Can the actions of this patriotic merchant move the hearts of general treacherous merchants?</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Education Department Urges Payment of Arrears for One or Two Months</h3>
<p>丨Arrears Have Reached Four Months丨</p>
<p>▲ Letter to the Jiangsu Education Fund Management Office</p>
<p>Zhou Fohai, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, wrote to the Jiangsu Education Fund Management Office, stating, "It has been found that the education funds in our province have been suffering from a shortage of revenue in recent years, and have been on the verge of exhaustion. Last year, affected by the famine and national crisis, the panic reached its peak. The funds of various agencies have been in arrears for many months, and it is almost impossible to maintain operations. Your office and this department share the responsibility for education funds throughout the province. In this time of crisis, despite various efforts to raise funds, we are still in a situation of 'a strong Sima looking up at the roof' and ultimately feel that it is difficult to cook without rice. At the beginning of this year, in view of the drawbacks of over-budgeting, unrealistic revenue, and actual expenditures, we adhered to the principle of 'determining expenditures based on revenue' when preparing the budget, striving to tighten expenditures and temporarily postponing the distribution of some expenditures to allow for flexibility in revenue fluctuations. The year has now begun for many months, and the autumn harvest has arrived, fortunately with a good yield. However, due to accumulated deficits, it is difficult to expect immediate replenishment. Recently, various educational institutions have submitted reports one after another, stating that the accumulation of arrears has increased rather than decreased, requesting solutions for relief. It has been found that the funds for provincial schools have mostly been issued up to July, and the arrears have reached four months, making it difficult to maintain operations. At this time after the autumn harvest, tax revenues will gradually improve. Your office should make every effort to raise cash and issue one or two months of funds in the short term to alleviate the urgent situation. At the same time, it is hoped that you will make a comprehensive calculation and estimate which month the funds will be issued by the end of January in the Gregorian calendar, and make advance plans, hoping that the arrears will gradually decrease and the funds will gradually stabilize. As for the aspects of supervision, collection, and urging delivery, there are many difficulties, which this department has long been aware of. If there are any discussions in the future, we will still do our best to coordinate solutions. This letter is sent accordingly, hoping that you will investigate and handle it, and we hope to receive a reply."</p>
<h3>Shandong High School Students Go on Strike</h3>
<p>▲ Due to the Refusal to Exempt Them from the Graduation Examination</p>
<p>▲ Requesting Certificates of Completion to Prepare for Transferring to Other Schools</p>
<p>▲ The School's Meeting to Mediate Was Unsuccessful</p>
<p>Jinan Express News. Shandong High School, previously ordered by the Department of Education to prepare this year's winter vacation graduates for the graduation examination, aroused resentment among the students in the general studies program. The students pointed out that the school has had seven principals in the past three years, and all faculty and staff have also advanced and retreated accordingly. The students' studies have been greatly affected by the constant turnover. Moreover, when the Jin army harassed Shandong, the school was closed for several months. When the Northeast Incident occurred, students went to Beijing to petition, wasting more than a month. Due to these factors, the loss suffered in their studies was enormous, and the responsibility could not be borne by the students. If they rashly take a graduation examination that requires a certain level, they will feel great difficulty. Moreover, the decision to hold the examination was not heard of beforehand. Now, at a time when the timing is urgent, suddenly ordering them to make up for the abandoned courses will make them worry about not having enough time to prepare. Therefore, the students of both classes gathered and submitted a request to the Department of Education for changes to be made, and publicly elected ten representatives to go to the Department to petition, stating the difficulties of not being able to take the examination. Director He replied that this was an order from above, and all provinces have complied, so this province cannot resist. The students of the two classes repeatedly requested, but were not approved. Therefore, they all became passive, went on strike, and requested the school to issue certificates of completion to prepare to leave the school and seek further education elsewhere. Two weeks have passed, and the matter has not been resolved. The school authorities felt unable to cope with the consensus of the students. As it was inconvenient to maintain this stalemate, they convened a school affairs meeting on the afternoon of the 22nd and unanimously decided to persuade the striking students to resume classes as soon as possible and then seek other solutions. It is reported that the students are still adhering to their original proposal and will not resume classes until the goal of exempting them from the examination is achieved.</p>
<h3>Labor Education to Be Implemented in Shandong Province</h3>
<p>▲ The Department of Education Formulates Draft Detailed Rules for the Implementation of Labor Education</p>

Classes will also be held on Sundays as usual. For factories, companies, and stores that work more than 10 hours a day, teaching will be conducted during working hours. For those who work less than 10 hours, it will be conducted outside of working hours.</p>

<h3>Shanghai-Hong Kong Interport Football Match Today Regardless of Rain or Shine</h3>
<p>丨Starting at 3 PM at Yiyuan丨</p>
<p>Shanghai Team Emphasizes Defense Over Offense</p>
<p>Hong Kong Team Emphasizes Offense Over Defense</p>
<p>Situation is Even, Each Has Opportunities</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Hong Kong interport football match will be held this afternoon at 3:00 PM, rain or shine, at the Yiyuan Football Field on Albert Road. The interport football match has not been held in Shanghai for three years. The Hong Kong team was originally scheduled to come to Shanghai last winter, but it was cancelled due to the January 28th Incident. Today's match is to make up for the match that was not held last year. The various circumstances of today's battle are compiled and published as follows:</p>
<h3>Shanghai Lineup</h3>
<p>Zhou Xianyan, Li Ning, Stokes, Helei, Zha Xu, Xu Yahui, Chen Zhenhe, Tuina, Bouldon, Chen Jiaqiu, Kai Zhi</p>
<p>Reserves: Marseille (inside defender), Weiss and (center back), Fafanqie, Laudon, Huogensheng (forward)</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Lineup</h3>
<p>Roger, Ma Lun, Shi Dulanqi, Beilishi, Paiduo, Duncan Bardley, Sun Jinshun, Huo Wei, Huang Meishun, Zheng Shaokang</p>
<p>Reserves: Liu Mao (inside defender), Liang Rongzhao (midfielder), Baila Yan (forward)</p>
<p>▲ Referee: Balatuo, Linesmen: Ma Ji'er, Bo Tuo</p>
<h3>Observations on Victory and Defeat</h3>
<p>▲ Shanghai. On the surface, the Shanghai team is a very strong team, but it is a team that emphasizes defense over offense. The talent in the back line is undeniable, but among the forwards, there are some who are difficult to satisfy. Among the five, there are too few who are good at shooting. Bouldon is the right winger of the special team, and he is being used as a lieutenant general without a trial match. Tuina has also not participated in a trial match. The advantages and disadvantages need no further explanation. In short, Shanghai has more than enough defense but insufficient offense.</p>
<p>Hong Kong. The strength of the Hong Kong forwards is obvious at a glance. Both wings are good, and the three players in the middle are also capable of fighting. We have not seen the performance of the defenders, but according to team leader Mo, the Hong Kong defenders are not good. The Hong Kong team emphasizes offense over defense. Therefore, the prediction of victory and defeat is that the Hong Kong team is in an offensive position, while the Shanghai team is in a defensive position. The Hong Kong team seems to have the upper hand. However, with the strong defense of the Shanghai team, there may be opportunities for the forwards to attack. Therefore, the opportunities for both sides are equal. Pre-match predictions may all be dangerous.</p>
<h3>Brief History of Interport Matches</h3>
<p>The interport competition began in 1924, with the Hong Kong Telegraph donating an interport silver cup. Football teams from various ports can participate in the competition, but only one team is allowed each year. If only two ports join, the winner of the first match will win the championship for that year. If there is no winner, the match will be replayed. If three teams join, they must compete in a round robin, and the team with the most points wins. If the scores are the same, they must compete again to determine the winner. The number of players in the interport competition must not exceed 15, as a restriction. Since the existence of interport matches in the Far East, most have been between Shanghai and Hong Kong. In 1908, the Shanghai Western Union Football Club sent a team to Hong Kong to compete with the Hong Kong Football Club, losing 3-0. In 1913, the Hong Kong Football Club also sent a team to Shanghai, competing at the racecourse. The result was a 1-1 draw. Extra time was played, and the Shanghai team finally won. This was the first legal interport match. Due to the suspension for many years due to the European War, the Shanghai and Hong Kong Football Clubs only planned to resume in 1922. The Hong Kong Football Club invited the Shanghai Football Club to send a team. The Shanghai Football Club, despite the extremely difficult economic conditions, agreed resolutely and competed in the spring of 1923. The Shanghai team actually won 3-0, which was unexpected. The match in Shanghai in 1924 was the most exciting. The first match at the Western Concession Stadium ended in a 3-3 draw. The competition in the second match was even fiercer, and the strength was very even. However, at the end of the match, Shanghai won with a clever goal from left inside forward Ke Er (who represented the Tianjin team this year). The match in Hong Kong in 1905 was won by the Hong Kong team 3-1. The match at the Shanghai Baseball Stadium in 1926 was lost by the Hong Kong team 4-5, despite their excellent skills. Three of Shanghai's goals were penalty kicks. In 1927, Shanghai lost 4-0 in Hong Kong. In 1928, they won 7-0 at the Baseball Stadium. In 1929, Hong Kong won 3-0 against Shanghai. In 1930, Shanghai defeated Hong Kong 5-2. The match in 1931 was held in Hong Kong. Shanghai, in a dangerous situation of 1-3, was able to score three goals in a row and reverse the defeat into a victory with a score of 4-3. From 1908 to the present, the two sides have competed a total of eleven times, with Shanghai winning seven times, scoring 28 goals, and Hong Kong winning four times, scoring 23 goals.</p>

<h3>Competitive Hero vs. British-American Football Match Postponed</h3>
<p>The Chinese Football Association announced that the British-American vs. Competitive Hero match scheduled for tomorrow has been postponed.</p>
<p>Unprecedented Women's Basketball Battle: Liangjiang Defeats Southeast</p>
<h3>Result: 38 to 33</h3>
<p>〓 Both Teams Have Excellent Skills, No Clear Advantage 〓</p>
<p>〓 Southeast Fails Due to Last-Minute Panic 〓</p>
<h3>Group B Victory Belongs to Xiaguang and Liangjiang B</h3>
<p>The women's basketball battle between Liangjiang and Southeast, whose skills were equal and difficult to distinguish, ended with Southeast narrowly losing 33-38 due to a chaotic lineup in the last eight minutes. The situation throughout the 40 minutes was nail-biting, with scores constantly going back and forth, often at the same level. At the end of the third quarter, the score was still tied at 27-27. The outcome of the match depended entirely on the final quarter. As for the performance of both sides, both had reached their peak, wonderfully incomparable. It was a pity that Southeast lost due to last-minute panic. Seven or eight hundred spectators in the Chinese Basketball Hall cheered loudly. Chen Rongming, the forward of Liangjiang, was as skilled as a male player, with light movements, strong strength, and a good long shot, and was a key player for Liangjiang. Chen Baixue, the small and agile defender, had a tight defense, and her contribution was also indispensable. Southeast's front line was average, but due to the loss of general Liu Yixuan to the rear guard due to three personal fouls, there was no connection in the back, which was then exploited by Liangjiang to build the final victory. In short, both teams showed high-level artistry in their performance, and both the winner and loser were glorious.</p>
<h3>Southeast Strives for Priority</h3>
<p>At exactly 7:00 PM, the female players of both teams appeared in costume and began to warm up. At 7:30, referee Shu Hong blew the whistle to mobilize the players, and both sides lined up and positioned themselves to begin the battle. Yang Sen, the short and fat player from Liangjiang, opened the scoring, and the crowd cheered loudly. Southeast made every effort to attack with beautiful passes, and Sun Yuxiu returned a goal. Yang Sen of Liangjiang scored on a penalty, and Southeast's Zhang Zhejun scored twice, taking a 6-3 lead. The momentum was strong for a while, and the supporters cheered loudly. Liangjiang reorganized its lineup and, with clear and beautiful passes, Chen Rongming added a goal, and Yang Sen scored from a long shot, making it 8-6, surpassing Southeast. In the tense atmosphere, before long, Miss Pan (Yueying) from Southeast tied the score (8-8). The atmosphere became even more serious. Both sides did their best, calmly advancing. Southeast penetrated under the basket, and Liangjiang defended tightly. Pan Yueying was unable to move, so she threw the ball backwards over the basket and succeeded in one fell swoop, which was breathtaking. Zhang Zhejun then scored, again taking a 12-8 lead. Seeing the unfavorable situation, Liangjiang tried to gain the upper hand. Chen Rongming hit the rim. The timekeeper sounded the whistle, announcing the end of the first half of the match. According to the record, Southeast took a 12-10 lead.</p>
<h3>Liangjiang Strives to Create a Tie</h3>
<p>With another command, Southeast continued to take the lead, and the situation was very good. Liangjiang fought hard and did not show any weakness, but the score did not change. Both sides were heavily guarded and rarely scored. Miss Pan and Miss Zhang from Southeast each scored a free throw, and Yang Sen of Liangjiang scored, without losing out. However, Pan Yueying added another point for Southeast, and Zhang Zhejun threw in a score from the side, adding a total of three points, with the score stopping at 17. Liangjiang gradually expanded, attacking section by section. Chen Rongming scored only one point, and Pan Meng scored twice, making it 17-17, becoming the score for the first half. In this section, Chen Baixue of Liangjiang worked very hard, and Misses Shi and Huang were also brave and restrained, and meticulous. Chen Xueqin of Southeast was agile and good at stealing, and Liu Yixuan and Wang Zhixin were steady and reliable. Both sides scored very few points.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle Time for Both Sides</h3>
<p>After the break, the momentum became urgent and high again. Everyone fought hard. The female players from Jiangwan seized the initiative, and Misses Pan and Zhang scored three times in a row, taking a lucky six-point lead. Seeing the unfavorable situation, Liangjiang called a timeout to discuss and change personnel, and launched a major counterattack. The two Chens and one Pan jointly charged, with great energy, adding as many as nine points, reversing the situation to surpass with a score of 26-23. The supporters also changed their patronage because of this, and the sound became stronger, and the wonderful performance was also tied to this moment. Southeast was not urgent or impatient, and desperately fought. Miss Sun added four points, and Chen Rongming from the other side scored a penalty, with the third section ending and the score being 27-27. Seeing this situation, the victory or defeat of both sides was not determined by technology, but only by luck. Let's see the last scene.</p>
<h3>The Southeast Suffers a Tragic Defeat</h3>
<p>In the final quarter, a crucial moment of life or death, both sides redoubled their efforts. However, the Southeast team unfortunately lost a key player at this point, namely Ms. Liu Yixuan, who was removed from the game for committing her third personal foul. Taking advantage of this opportunity, Liangjiang's Chen Liangcai scored two points. Nevertheless, the Southeast team continued their efforts without showing any weakness. Miss Sun scored one point from a free throw, and Pan Yueying made a field goal, bringing the score to 30-29, with the Southeast leading by one point. At this juncture, with little time remaining, Chen Rongming of Liangjiang made a lucky long-range shot, which greatly boosted the morale of the Liangjiang team and dampened that of the Southeast team. At this point, the Southeast team had a free throw opportunity, and if they could have made the shot, their momentum might have been restored. However, Miss Zhang was overly cautious, and her heart wavered, causing her to miss the opportunity. From then on, Liangjiang advanced mightily, their vigor flourishing. Making successful shots from both close and long range, they scored repeatedly. The Southeast team's formation became increasingly flustered, and coupled with their eagerness to win, their control was lost instantly. The sound of a tragic defeat then rose with the referee's whistle. Liangjiang reversed the defeat and won with a score of 38-33, which can be considered fortunate.</p>

<h3>The French Concession Private School Association Requests Subsidies from the Municipal Council</h3>
<p>A Letter Was Sent Yesterday Requesting Implementation Starting Next Year</p>
<p>A Delegation of All Committee Members Will Petition on Monday</p>
<p>The French Concession Private Middle School Association is requesting subsidies from the French Municipal Council. It was originally scheduled for 9:00 AM on the 28th of this month, with one representative from each school setting off to petition the French Municipal Council. It has now been learned that the association has decided to change the plan due to the large number of representatives from each school. Instead, the entire Executive and Supervisory Committee will represent the association and go to petition. Yesterday, the association sent a letter to the French Municipal Council, requesting that it implement subsidies for schools within the concession starting in 1933.</p>
<p>Below is an excerpt from the original letter: To the French Municipal Council, Since the opening of Shanghai and the establishment of your council, more than eighty years have passed. Various undertakings within the concession have gradually developed. According to recent surveys, the number of Chinese immigrants has reached 462,342, of which 128,437 are school-age children. Your council's annual operating budget and other income total 6,921,732 taels, of which only 218,200 taels are used for education. This allocation seems inappropriate. Furthermore, of the 218,200 taels allocated to education, more than half is used for Western children (Western children's public schools receive 130,000 taels), who number only 2,737. Chinese people pay more than two-thirds of all tax revenue, but the education funds for Chinese children are only 18,200 taels, which is even more unfair. Therefore, we Chinese students often lament the lack of opportunities. The reason why our schools and others have raised funds to establish private primary and secondary schools is to provide relief for Chinese children who have lost their education and to fulfill the duties of citizens of China. However, private funding is ultimately limited, and the reason why the content of the schools cannot be enriched and the undertakings cannot be fully developed is due to economic constraints. Therefore, on November 5th, we convened private primary and secondary schools in the French Concession to discuss the development of education within the concession. After unanimous agreement among the schools present, we request that your council subsidize private primary and secondary schools within the concession with 20% of the total annual income starting in 1933 in order to develop Chinese education. In view of the principle of equal rights and obligations, we believe that your council will definitely grant our request. The purpose of the above is to satisfy the legitimate desires of the Chinese people. Therefore, we send this letter to you specifically, hoping that you will consider it and give us a prompt reply. We are eagerly awaiting your response. To the French Municipal Council.</p>

<h3>The Chinese Cooperative Society Re-elects Executive Committee Members</h3>
<p>The Chinese Cooperative Society is an organization dedicated to the study of cooperative mechanisms. Over the years, it has made tireless efforts to promote cooperative endeavors. It has also held numerous cooperative training courses and published thirty to forty cooperative monthly magazines and cooperative series of books. The society previously held its Third General Meeting of Members in Suzhou from October 8th to 10th to exchange members' opinions, clarify the direction of the society's work, and discuss fundamental solutions to the rural economic crisis. At the meeting, the Third Executive Committee members were re-elected. Due to the limited number of members in attendance, it was decided to elect seven committee members to ensure the election's universality. The Nomination Committee then nominated three times the number of Executive Committee members as candidates and held the election through correspondence. It is now learned that as of the 24th, a total of 142 ballots were received. The Second Executive Committee requested members He Youmei, Hou Zhe'an (replaced by Zhao Shusheng), and Hou Houpei to be the ballot counters. The results of the ballot count are as follows: Wang Shiying, Chen Guofu, Wang Zhixin, Chen Zhongming, Tang Qizi, Shou Miancheng, He Yushu, Hou Houpei, and Xu Shaodi were elected as Executive Committee members. Yu Jingtang, Tong Yumin, Wu Nong, Hou Zhe'an, and Zhang Kaizhi (Mrs. Xue Xianzhou) were elected as alternate Executive Committee members. It is heard that Mrs. Xue received the same number of votes as Zhang Kaizhi and a lottery will be used to decide the winner.</p>

<h3>Unanimous Uprising Against Japan at Home and Abroad</h3>
<p>Telegrams Were Sent to the League of Nations Yesterday Expressing Support</p>
<p>Shanghai Organizations Sent Telegrams of Condolence to the Delegation</p>
<p>Muslims Nationwide Requested Justice Be Upheld</p>
<p>As the Council of the League of Nations convened and the Sino-Japanese debate commenced, Representative Gu Weijun engaged in heated exchanges with Matsuoka. His fervor was greatly inspiring. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Banking Association, and the Shanghai Cotton Yarn Traders Association sent telegrams of condolence, dispatched by the International Problems Research Association. The text is recorded below: "To Representative Yan of China in Geneva, we commend your hard work and extend our deepest respect. Our associations have resolved to provide support and hereby send this telegram."</p>
<p>Muslims nationwide sent a telegram from Shanghai to Yan Huiqing, China's chief representative in Geneva, requesting that he convey to the chairman of the Council of the League of Nations a plea for justice in the Sino-Japanese incident. At the same time, Muslim representatives issued a statement denying Japanese fabrications. The original telegram was in French and has been translated into Chinese by Muslims. The text is as follows: "To General Representative Yan in Geneva and to the Chairman and all members of the Council of the League of Nations, we, the five hundred million Chinese Muslim community, are extremely indignant at the trampling of the three eastern provinces by the Japanese. We implore the representatives of all friendly nations to uphold justice and collectively impose sanctions against Japan. In the name of the most just and powerful sovereign, we will never recognize the independence of Manchuria and vow to recover the land of our country seized by the enemy. We are determined to uphold the principle of defending the country with our faith. Muslim brothers and sisters around the world express their courageous and resolute sympathy with the Chinese Muslims. We request that the representatives of all friendly nations announce this. Sincerely, the Preparatory Office of the All-China Muslim People's Association." Yesterday, Ma Xingdong, a local Muslim representative in Shanghai, issued a statement denying the false news fabricated by the Japanese United News Agency regarding the public opinion of Muslims. He stated that the total number of Muslims in the three eastern provinces is less than four million, so how could there be as many as five million in a corner of northern Manchuria? This is sufficient proof of its falsification. Mr. Ma said that, according to his personal knowledge, on average, there are twenty Muslims out of every hundred in the anti-Japanese volunteer army in northern Manchuria, which shows that their determination to resist Japan is the same as that of other religious believers in the country. The Muslims there will also never act inconsistently with the actions of Muslims in other parts of the country. When the League of Nations investigation team arrived in the Northeast, the Japanese openly staged plays and movies, etc., to be watched by the ignorant people of the Northeast. All those who attended had to sign their names in advance and were also given a bag of biscuits. Then, the puppet state used this signature book as a petition to the League of Nations investigation team. This is conclusive evidence of their fabrication of public opinion. Mr. Ma finally stated that the Japanese side's propaganda is entirely intended to provoke discord among the ethnic groups in our country. The government should strictly prohibit those who provoke ethnic opinions among Chinese and foreigners, and at the same time, it is hoped that people at home and abroad will not be exploited.</p>

<p>Discussion of Important Matters</p>
<p>Election of Officers</p>
<p>People from all walks of life in this city, in view of the loyalty and bravery of the Northeast Volunteer Army in resisting Japan, fighting bloody battles in the freezing snow, and the Japanese imperialists recently investigating and dispatching a large number of troops to besiege them, the Volunteer Army is suffering from hunger and cold, lacking guns and ammunition, and the situation is extremely critical, urgently needing large-scale assistance.

<h3>Li Yulin and Others Issue a Circular Telegram to Go Out of the Pass and Resist Japan</h3>
<p>A Circular Telegram from the Commander of the Republic of China People's National Salvation Army to the Whole Country (titles omitted): All are aware that it is the constant principle of the universe that heaven covers and earth supports, and the great righteousness of the Spring and Autumn Annals that there is an inner Xia and an outer Yi. Now our Northeast, a fertile land, is covered with bloody felt, and hundreds of millions of our compatriots are being brutally slaughtered. And the puppet Pu Yi, comparing himself to a child emperor, personally continues the legacy of Shi Jingtang. In this dog year and sheep month, the earth cracks and the sky collapses, and the ancestral spirits of Yan and Huang are hungry and fearful. In the past, Wu Rui used a single brigade from Lingzhi to pacify the armies of the seven states, and Tao Kan used the remaining people after the flooding of the Yangtze River to support a declining dynasty. Is there really no one in the great land of China today? Even with just three households, Qin could be overthrown, let alone with the masses. Striking the oars in the middle of the stream, righteousness fills the air. Seeking revenge for nine generations, sincerity penetrates the sun. The blood of Songjiang and Xupu is still warm, and the beacon fires of the Black Water and White Mountains are raging. This is the time to continue the struggle, to decide the outcome with ten attacks and ten resolutions. Yulin has spent half his life in the military, and is ashamed to end his days behind closed doors. Still healthy, he is willing to devote himself to the cause. Moreover, many of the Northeast Volunteer Army are old subordinates. Recently, letters and telegrams have been pouring in, urging him to share in the common crisis and declare the great righteousness together. And now that the green gauze curtain has been lifted, the flames of the enemy are rising again, sharpening their swords and preparing their horses, intending to use all their strength to wipe out the Volunteer Army, hoping to realize their long-cherished dream of dominating the mainland. This is still tolerable, but it cannot be for the country. With great righteousness before us, how can we allow ourselves to hesitate? Feeling the weight of camaraderie, we rise to action. Aware that the national lifeline is as thin as a thread, we raise the oars and set out. Therefore, we have gathered the heroes of the north and the strong men of Henan and Luoyang, more than 500,000 strong. We declare our oath to heaven with three oaths, and assume the post of Commander-in-Chief of the Republic of China People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army, vowing to share hardships and rely on each other in times of danger with the heroes of the Central Plains and the Northeast Volunteer Army, to jointly save the people from misery and restore the majesty of the Han officials. All my comrades, do not waver in your hearts. Our ancestors Yan and Huang are truly our witnesses. Commander-in-Chief of the Republic of China People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army, Li Yulin; Chief of Staff, Gan Yun; Commander of the First Army Corps, Xie Jun; Commander of the Second Army Corps, Li Guanjun; together with all officers and soldiers, respectfully salute.</p>

<h3>Central Committee Members in Shanghai to Go to Beijing to Attend the Third Plenary Session</h3>
<p>League of Nations Meeting and Urgent Diplomacy</p>
<p>Concentrate Efforts on Actively Resisting Japan</p>
<p>The Fourth Third Plenary Session has been scheduled to be held in Beijing on December 15. At this time of the League of Nations meeting and urgent diplomacy, the Central Committee members bear the important responsibility of the party and the country, and should gather in Beijing as soon as possible with the spirit of facing the national crisis together, to jointly discuss the great plan of saving the country. Therefore, the party headquarters of various provinces and cities have repeatedly telegraphed Mayor Wu, urging the Central Committee members in Shanghai to attend the plenary session. Yesterday, the Central News Agency reporter visited the Central Committee members in Shanghai to inquire about various matters concerning attending the Third Plenary Session. It is now known that there are a total of twenty-eight Central Committee members in Shanghai, who have gathered and discussed attending and preparing proposals four times, and decided to jointly go to Beijing to attend before the meeting, to jointly discuss the great plan of saving the country. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Central Committee Members in Shanghai: According to the Central News Agency reporter's investigation, there are a total of twenty-eight Central Committee members in Shanghai, including Wu Tiecheng, Sun Ke, Li Liejun, Xue Dubi, Li Jishen, Liu Luyin, Ma Chaojun, Yang Shukan, Cheng Qian, Zhang Dingfan, Chen Ce, Zhang Huichang, Sun Jingya, Bai Wenwei, Chen Jiagu, Xiong Kewu, Jiao Yitang, Fang Zhenwu, Qin Zhen, Gui Chongji, Deng Jiayan, Zhang Zhiben, He Shizhen, Xie Chi, Yang Hu, Wang Boqun, Liang Hancao, Liu Yazi, etc. They are all scheduled to go to Beijing to attend before the fifteenth of next month. ▲ Preparing Proposals: According to Li Liejun's words to the Central News Agency reporter yesterday, Sun Zhesheng and other Central Committee members in Shanghai have already held several meetings to discuss the issue of proposals for the Third Plenary Session, so as to have full contact. The opinions tend to be consistent, and they plan to jointly draft a proposal. The content of the proposal includes two points: ㈠ resisting foreign aggression ㈡ reforming internal affairs. These two points are the principles of the proposal, Li said, due to illness he could not sit for long, so he took out his letter to the Central Committee members to show the reporter,</p>
<p>▲ Letter to Central Committee Members: The letter from Central Committee member Li Liejun to the Central Committee members is roughly as follows: Political corruption and urgent foreign aggression make it impossible for the people of the whole country to use their intelligence to face the national crisis. This is the greatest crisis of our country. It has been ill for a long time and is in a situation of nine deaths and one life. The Kuomintang of China is holding the Third Plenary Session, acting on behalf of the national political power, and the responsibility is heavy, what is there to wait for? The number of Central Committee members attending has a huge impact. All those who are members should, of course, express their opinions based on their conscience. However, the Central Committee members, being all members of the Kuomintang, should, of course, have full contact before the meeting, so that their opinions tend to be consistent, and jointly make a general proposal, with a majority of signatures. And this proposal must take the rapid realization of national politics and active resistance to Japan and the recovery of lost land as the greatest concern. In this way, those who attend will be enthusiastic, and this meeting can be said to have results for the people of the country, and so on.</p>
<p>"...exerted efforts, and the cost of the strike reached more than ten thousand yuan," etc. The National Postal Workers' Union and postal workers' unions in various places believe that Chen's wording is extremely absurd and insulting to postal workers, and issue a solemn joint statement to refute it.</p>
<p>It is briefly stated that according to reports, Chen Fumu's telegram from Hong Kong contains words such as "assigning party members, exerting efforts, and the cost of the strike reached more than ten thousand yuan," insulting postal workers beyond description. It is found that in May, the national postal workers' general strike was entirely to seek the implementation of a plan to consolidate the postal foundation. This heart and this aspiration can be attested by heaven and earth. All the expenses of the strike have always been paid from the membership dues. The union's aspirations are firm, and its purpose is clear, and it will never be moved by bureaucratic politicians. Since the resumption of work, the struggle has been persistent, just like in the past, and it can naturally be credited to the society. Chen Fumu has abused his position and violated the law, and fled in fear of crime. What is the purpose of his sudden and outrageous words? It is really hateful. Fortunately, the facts of the union are all there. If the law has not been extinguished, Chen will never be allowed to cover up the eyes and ears of the world with one hand. This is a solemn statement from the National Postal Workers' Union and postal workers' unions across the country.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Gladly Use Domestically Produced Silk Fabrics</h3>
<p>Saying They Can Compete with Western Weaves</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce previously received a request from the Chinese New Rong Company in Vancouver, Canada, to purchase domestically produced silk fabrics. It later received a reply, highly praising them, saying that they can compete with Western weaves, and remitting funds to purchase domestically produced silk fabrics again. The original letter is recorded as follows: To the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, Greetings. Now, having read the letter, I am fully aware of everything. I have received the four pieces of silk satin from Heng Huiji Silk Store. Please do not mention it. However, goods sent to foreign countries must use the language of that country to create an invoice so that they can be declared for customs duties upon arrival. The goods received by our company were subject to tax guarantees because there was no invoice in English. I pray that you will create an invoice in English for the previously paid goods so that I can recover the deposit. I am now remitting Shanghai silver dollars two hundred yuan, and with the remaining funds from before, a total of more than two hundred yuan. I am now attaching several samples of seasonal silk satins of various styles. I pray that you will use this money to purchase them according to these styles. I believe that these styles must be sold in large quantities in various silk stores and do not need to be specially woven, lest special weaving delay the date. The winter solstice is approaching, so please make the purchase as soon as possible. If there are any new and beautiful styles that are welcomed by the hearts of the people, please accept your kind instructions. If the goods, after arrival, are made of high-quality domestic products that can indeed add color to the market, I will definitely continue to purchase them. The goods of the previous style can indeed compete with Western weaves, and so on. It is heard that the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce has already used the funds remitted by the overseas Chinese for the second time to purchase from the silk satin industry.</p>

<h3>Two American Youths Climb a High Peak in Xikang</h3>
<p>With a Chinese Man Named Yang Participating</p>
<p>Adventurous Mountaineering to Fulfill Their Ambition</p>
<p>And Obtain Plant Specimens</p>
<p>The Continental News reports that yesterday, it received a telegram sent from Xikang on October 1 stating that the two American youths, Moore and Busell, climbed Mount Minya Konka (translated) in the Yalong Mountains (translated) of Xikang on October 28. (According to the Kang language, Konka means snow, and Minya means big, which is suspected to be Daxue Mountain. This mountain range is located between the Dajinchuan and Yalong Rivers, and the original text Niarong Mountain is also similar in sound to Yalong (unknown whether it is)). The peak is 24,000 feet high, making it one of the highest peaks in the world. Moore is a member of the New York Explorers Club and the American Alpine Club and has climbed dangerous peaks in North and South America many times. Busell is also a mountaineering expert.

Yang and Moore departed from Shanghai in early August to arrange everything in Sichuan. Amundsen and Taun waited for the scientific instruments to arrive in Shanghai before continuing to Sichuan at the end of August. This telegram was sent by Yang. It is heard that climbing Mount Minya Konka is one of the team's ambitions. This mountain towers into the sky, and can be seen from hundreds of miles away in Xikang. The summit is covered in ice and snow all year round, making it a major obstacle for explorers and mountaineers. This time, they have reached the summit, which can be said to fulfill their ambition. In addition, collecting specimens of the big Aden tree and Xikang plants is also one of the team's goals.</p>

<h3>Shaanxi and Gansu Muslims Come to Shanghai</h3>
<p>To Telegraphically Request the Execution of the Beixin Case</p>
<p>Regarding the Beixin Bookstore insulting Islam, Muslims from Gansu and Shaanxi came to Shanghai yesterday, residing in various places, to handle this matter. There was also an official telegram to Beijing, the original text is as follows: To the Nanjing Central Party Department, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of the Interior, Muslims learned in Gansu that the Zhangxin Bookstore published content insulting Islam, claiming it to be a Gansu legend. The relationship between Han and Muslims is very good. Such insults by the bookstore are intentional provocations. The Muslim community is extremely indignant and has come to Shanghai together to prepare to present a petition, requesting that the bookstore be severely punished with internal rebellion. The Shanghai Islamic United Association, which was reported in Beijing, has been approved to seal up the bookstore and investigate all the criminals, deeply appreciating the government's fairness in protecting religion. Now there are obstacles in the middle, and the bookstore has not been sealed up. Muslims regard defending the country through religion, and will never be reconciled with the bookstore. For this reason, we urgently request to telegraph the Shanghai Municipal Government again to implement the sealing up of the bookstore in order to calm the hearts of the people. Wu Xiling, Bai Youwen, Fazhen, Ma Yuhua, Ma Degan, Ma Cunzhi, He Baizhen, Li Tianxi, Ding Youfu, Ding Youlu, Liu Yucun, Su Zizhen, Shen Hairu, Ding Shichang, etc., from Shaanxi and Gansu Muslims, respectfully salute from the Xiaotaoyuan Mosque in Shanghai. This telegram was sent out yesterday afternoon. It is heard that the Muslims in the Northwest are very angry about this case. There are many people who came to Shanghai this time, all devout religious and noble followers. They passed through Xuzhou, and there were news reporters who talked to them. It is also heard that the followers plan to go to places such as Egypt and India to investigate religious affairs and worship in Mecca before returning to Shanghai and Gansu.</p>

<p>Notifying All Sectors The committee sent letters to various organizations yesterday, stating: "Dear Sirs, Since the outbreak of the January 28th Songhu Incident, the members of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce Boy Scout Regiment (the 50th Regiment of the Chinese Boy Scouts), based on their duties, automatically rose up to organize stretcher rescue teams, etc., entering and exiting the battlefield, rushing through the rain of bullets, serving the rear, and striving to support the wounded and rescue the dying. With the spirit of loving youth, the country, the nation, and humanity, they always advanced and retreated together with the loyal and brave soldiers, demonstrating the enthusiasm of military-civilian cooperation and promoting the loyal, brave, and decisive nature of the Boy Scouts. The number of our soldiers and civilians who were rescued and survived is countless. Luo Yunxiang, Ying Wenda, Bao Zhengwu, and Mao Zhengxiang, the four Boy Scouts who sacrificed themselves to save others, died in the line of duty. The General Association of Chinese Boy Scouts believes that the four martyrs sacrificed their lives for the country, and their courage was extraordinary, breaking world records and creating national news. Without a grand memorial service, it would not be enough to comfort their loyal souls. Therefore, the Shanghai Municipal Boy Scout Council was specially ordered to hold a grand memorial service, and Zicheng and others were appointed to be responsible for the preparations. Now, it has been decided at the first preparatory meeting of our committee to hold a memorial service at 2:00 PM on December 11th (Sunday) inside the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce to express our condolences and commend their loyalty. If you would be kind enough to attend or generously provide elegiac couplets and eulogies, we would be extremely grateful. Please send any materials directly to our committee inside the Shanghai North Suzhou Road Municipal Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<p>National Products Manufacturers Enthusiastically Participate in the Mudu Market</p>
<h3>Sponsored by the National Products Traveling Propaganda Group</h3>
<p>Since the National Products Traveling Propaganda Group of Xiaoximen established another traveling film group and set off, it has been even more welcomed by the people in various places. Recently, in response to the invitation of Mudu, the chief town of Wu County, it organized a temporary national products market for two weeks. Since the preparation, those who have enthusiastically joined include: China Enamel Factory, Samsung Cotton Weaving Factory, Wuhe Weaving Factory, Tianchu MSG Factory, Huafu Hat Factory, Marie Stationery Factory, Yixin Toothbrush Factory, Zufuwu Sock Factory, China Chemical Industry Factory, Dafu Rubber Factory, Jisheng Industrial Cooperative, Shixinchang Hat Shop, Hongzhang Cloth Factory, World Store, and more than twenty other companies. In addition, there will be film propaganda. It is scheduled to gather and depart at the 28th, and the opening ceremony will be held on the first of next month.

<h3>National Products Association Collects Exhibition Goods on Behalf</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Products Factory Joint Association sent a letter to various factories yesterday, stating: "Dear Sirs, On the 22nd of this month, we received a letter from the office of the National Railway Production Goods Exhibition of the Ministry of Railways, stating that the office is organizing the National Railway Production Goods Exhibition and collecting various goods. Notices have been published in newspapers, and the Ministry has requested the provincial governments, municipal governments, social bureaus, industry bureaus, construction bureaus, etc., to widely collect goods and send them to the office to participate in the exhibition. It has been decided that this exhibition will be held in Shanghai this year and is scheduled to open in mid-December. It is feared that the participating parties are not fully aware of this, resulting in omissions. It is proposed that your association send personnel or find ways to notify various factories, companies, and shops, explaining that the exhibition organized by this office is held periodically every year in major commercial ports and major cities. It is not merely mobile propaganda, but allows merchants to directly understand production and sales locations, production and sales prices, and transportation methods and costs, so as to understand profit margins and provide opportunities for business development to merchants, which is closely related to both production and sales. Based on this idea, we strongly urge various merchants to advocate and persuade them to actively respond and achieve the effect of smooth sales of national products. As for the goods to be collected, please send them to the office before the opening date to avoid delays. In addition, the exhibits collected this time are divided into two types: gifts and deposits. If there are valuable products, they can also be deposited for exhibition. After the exhibition is over, they can be returned. Accordingly, we are sending thirty copies of the regulations and micro-collection methods and investigation forms to your association for review and handling." The association received this approval. It was found that Xu Bingxiang, the leader of the collection team of the Railway Ministry Exhibition Office, came to the association to discuss that the first exhibition will be held in Shanghai. Because the location has not yet been determined, all products of Shanghai national product manufacturers participating in the exhibition will be temporarily collected and forwarded by our association. The regulations, investigation forms, and collection methods are insufficient for distribution. Please inform us in advance when your factory submits the products, and we will send them immediately. Accordingly, we are writing to your factory for review and handling, and we eagerly await your response.</p>
<p>No Increase in Import Tax for Dutch East Indies</p>
<h3>Still 150 Guilders</h3>
<p>Rumors have spread that the Dutch East Indies has taken actions against the Chinese and increased taxes. Yesterday, a reporter met with a Chinese staff member of the Java Shipping Company on Sichuan Road, who said that he had not heard of any mistreatment of Chinese in the Dutch East Indies. However, regarding the tax increase, the company contacted the Dutch Consulate for inquiries after seeing the report, and the reply was that there was no such order and they had not heard of such a thing. He also said that most of the overseas Chinese who go to the Dutch East Indies take the company's ships, and the taxes paid are also collected by the company on its behalf, so he is sure that the import tax paid is still 150 guilders.</p>
<p>Jiujiang Chamber of Commerce Advocates Re-Levying Import Tax on Foreign Rice</p>
<h3>Decline in Agricultural Production Affects All Industries</h3>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce received a letter from the Jiujiang Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating: "Dear Sirs, We found that November 1st of this year was the date for our chamber to hold the annual meeting of member representatives from various industries. There were many proposals, including suggestions from the porcelain and rice industries. The decline in agricultural production has led to the decline of all industries. Please quickly find a way to treat the symptoms to avoid further deterioration. The general idea is that my country's agriculture has been on the verge of crisis in recent years, which is undeniable. The reasons are nothing more than two points: First, the influx of foreign rice, sold at low prices, hinders the sales of domestic agricultural products. Second, inland donations and taxes are too heavy, and transportation is difficult, hindering the development of rice merchants' business. Due to these two reasons, the rural economy is bankrupt, and the business of rice merchants is declining, making it impossible to recover, which in turn affects other industries. To reverse this crisis, it is necessary to implement protectionist trade policies and encourage the consumption of agricultural products. The advantages and disadvantages are obvious. We should urgently petition the central government to levy heavy taxes on imported foreign rice to resist it, and we should also petition the provincial government to continue to exempt Jiujiang rice from using passports, allow free loading, and avoid complications, so as to benefit transportation. After deliberation, the representatives of various industries believed that the reasons were justified and decided to pass the resolution. I think that my country has always been based on agriculture, and the decline of agricultural production means the country will be no more. To fundamentally eliminate the crisis, in addition to submitting a separate report, we should also write to your association to understand the reasons for the decline in domestic rice prices and the damage to agriculture, and forward the discussion to the central government to strictly implement the increase in import taxes on foreign rice, which may help to resist the crisis. This is our sincere hope." After receiving the letter, the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce has telegraphed the Executive Yuan and various ministries of the National Government, requesting the re-levying of import taxes on foreign rice to save the rural economy.</p>

<h3>Continued Trial of the Major Case of Malfeasance in Disaster Relief Yang Shucheng, Quan Shaowu, and Other Defendants All Arrived Contracts and Flour Have Been Clearly Examined</h3>
<p>丨Quan Shaowu Also Responded to the Seven Charges Against Him One by One丨</p>
<h3>Xu Shiying Publishes Opinions on the Prosecution Case</h3>
<p>The massive case of corruption in the relief efforts in northern Anhui has garnered increasing attention from all walks of life since its public trial began in the First Special District Court on the 21st of this month. Yesterday afternoon, during the continuation of the trial, even more people flocked to the court to listen, filling almost every available space. At 2:30 PM, the plaintiffs, representatives of the Anhui Association of Shanghai Li Zhenya, Lu Chewu, Hong Ding, Wang Zhu, and Hu Peiru, and the defendants, officials of the National Government Flood Relief Committee Yang Shucheng, Quan Shaowu, and Cha Liangzhao, as well as the plaintiffs' lawyers Li Shirui and Chen Zhongyin, and the defendants' lawyers Jiang Yiping and Zhang Xingyan, successively arrived at the court. Shortly after, the presiding judge Wu Tingqi and the court clerk ascended the bench. Lawyer Li stood up and stated that the circumstances of the case were unusually complex and difficult to understand at once. It would be best to summon the investigators who were sent to northern Anhui to testify first, which would make it easier to understand. The Anhui Association of Shanghai, after receiving the investigators' report, had sent a letter to the Flood Relief Committee inquiring about remedial measures. Subsequently, because the Flood Relief Committee's reply was irrelevant, they proceeded with the lawsuit, and so on. The three lawyers for the defendant, Cha Liangzhao, and others, unanimously opposed summoning the investigators to testify first, stating that the accusations made by the plaintiff should be examined one by one. The investigators' report could only be used as a reference.</p>
<p>Issue of Date of Taking Office Judge Wu asked the plaintiff Li Zhenya about the part of Yang Shucheng's indictment, which had not been fully examined in the previous hearing. The original complaint stated that Yang Shucheng took office as the transportation commissioner on January 15th, while Yang submitted a draft telegram proving that it was before January 24th and that he was not responsible for transportation. What was the actual situation? Li said that Yang had talked with the investigators and said that he took office on January 15th, which was recorded in the investigators' report. The dispute was only about a ten-day period, but Yang should be responsible outside of those ten days.</p>
<p>Misinformation About the Wheat Transportation Company Judge Wu asked Li about Yang Shucheng entrusting the Yixing Company to transport wheat. Li said that this was obtained from investigations with the Jinpu Railway Bureau and the transportation industry. Yang transported 3,000 tons of wheat from the Jinpu Railway to Bengbu starting on January 18th, entrusted to the Huafeng Company for transit. The complaint mistakenly stated Yixing. During the period before and after he took office as transportation commissioner, the relief wheat was not loaded or transported, which was a fact and could not be denied. Because he obstructed the transportation of relief wheat, many disaster victims in northern Anhui starved to death.</p>
<p>Reason for Not Suing Baker Judge Wu asked, since Yang Shucheng was assisting in handling transportation, there must be another person in charge. Why only blame the defendant? Li said that the transportation department was actually engaged in joint corruption. However, Yang could not evade responsibility by only suing him alone. Judge Wu said that the head of the transportation department, the American Baker, had said last time that Yang Shucheng had no right to obstruct the transportation of relief wheat. Li said that he originally wanted to sue Baker as well, but because he was a foreigner and not subject to the jurisdiction of our country's courts.</p>
<p>Process of Three Wheat Purchases The court then turned to questioning Yang Shucheng about purchasing wheat from the Flood Relief Committee. According to Yang, he purchased a total of three times. The first time was around February 20th of this year, for several thousand tons, at a price of 3.9 taels per ton, without a contract. The wheat was transported and stored in Bengbu by the Flood Relief Committee, so the delivery was in Bengbu. The second time was around March 20th, purchasing 900 tons, at a price of 3.7 taels, also without a contract. The third time was on March 22nd, purchasing 9,000 tons, at the same price as the second time. This time, there was a contract, signed by the Vice Chairman of the Flood Relief Committee, Xin Bo Sen, while Baker and Cha Liangzhao signed as witnesses. However, the wheat from the second and third times, although purchased in Pukou, was transported to Bengbu by the Flood Relief Committee for delivery, with full exemption of freight, and so on.</p>
<p>Reason for Selling Relief Wheat According to the defendant Cha Liangzhao, his and Baker's signatures did not bear any responsibility, only proving the matter. He also submitted a recent letter from Xin Bo Sen, stating that the Flood Relief Committee sold relief wheat because it urgently needed cash and had obtained permission from the US government. Xin's letter stated the details, which should be inspected. At this time, the plaintiff's lawyer presented three draft copies, stating that these were draft copies of the contract for the Flood Relief Committee selling wheat to Yang, obtained by the Anhui Association from the Flood Relief Committee. Examining the order of signatures on this contract, it was clear that Cha Liangzhao and Baker both bore responsibility. Yang Shucheng said that there was only one contract, so where did the other two contract drafts come from?</p>
<p>Only One Contract Confirmed Cha heard this and immediately defended, saying that there was indeed only one contract. The first and second sales of wheat did not have contracts, only recorded in a memorandum. Because of his position, he should sign the memorandum. This time, the Anhui Association copied the draft contract from the Flood Relief Committee and even copied the memorandum together, now mistakenly recognizing it as a contract, and so on. Lawyer Jiang Yiping added that the contract required signatures from both parties. The first and second copies did not have Yang Shucheng's signature, clearly showing that they were not contracts. Judge Wu then instructed Li Zhenya to verify the evidence. Regarding the wheat sale, it was the Flood Relief Committee's decision, and whether there was a loss or not was unrelated to other parties.</p>
<p>Involving the Entire Relief Committee Li replied that regarding this issue, before filing the lawsuit, he had carefully considered it. He deeply felt that the Flood Relief Committee should be responsible. However, the plaintiff did not want to expand the scope, so he did not accuse them one by one. Lawyer Jiang blamed Li for his careless remarks, as what Li said involved the entire Flood Relief Committee. The case has attracted domestic and foreign attention, and the plaintiff only filed a criminal self-accusation based on one investigative report. Criminal lawsuits should be based on direct evidence. The plaintiff must provide concrete proof and cannot be vague, making arbitrary accusations.</p>
<p>Investigation of Wheat Turned into Flour Judge Wu, among the charges against Yang, still had the accusation of turning wheat into flour, which had not yet been inquired about. He immediately inquired about the circumstances of the accusation. According to Yang, because the disaster victims in the Zhengyangguan area did not like wheat but needed flour, the Westerner stationed in Bengbu by the Flood Relief Committee exchanged wheat for flour at his Baoxing Flour Mill, with 80 kilograms of flour for every 100 kilograms of wheat. There was a letter from the Westerner to prove it. The plaintiff Li Zhenya refuted this, saying that at that time, the disaster victims were already filling their stomachs with tree bark and grass roots. Giving them wheat would be like giving them precious delicacies, and they would not be so greedy, rejecting wheat and needing flour. The letter presented by the defendant was from someone working in the same organization and was not credible. The plaintiff's lawyer presented a public letter from the Anhui Provincial Government regarding turning wheat into flour, saying that everything would be clear by looking at this.</p>
<p>Part of Quan Shaowu At this point in the hearing, the court announced that the charges against Yang Shucheng had been generally examined. Now it was necessary to question the charges against the second defendant, Quan Shaowu. Li Zhenya was ordered to state one by one the seven charges against Quan Shaowu, including stopping the release of relief grain and deducting relief funds. Then, Quan Shaowu was ordered to answer each charge one by one. Quan responded to the first charge, stopping the release of relief grain in Wuhe County, stating that the county had an incident of beating relief workers on May 24th and 25th. He was in Bengbu when he heard the news and sent a telegram. Although there were the words "temporary suspension," the relief was not actually stopped, and so on. Both sides made statements and presented evidence until 5:00 PM. The judge then announced that the court was adjourned and would continue the hearing on the afternoon of December 6th.</p>
<p>Xu Shiying Returned to Shanghai Yesterday Xu Jingren, Chairman of the National Government Relief Committee, had requested leave to return to his ancestral home in Qiupu to mourn his deceased father. Now, due to numerous official duties, he returned to Shanghai early. He arrived by boat at noon yesterday. After a brief rest, he went to the Relief Committee office in Renji Hall to review official documents. A reporter from the Huadong News Agency asked Xu about the truth of the case involving the Flood Relief Committee officials being involved in corruption. According to Xu, he did not know anything about the inside story after this matter occurred. The Anhui Association's accusation included his name as a standing committee member, but he had not heard about it beforehand. As a standing committee member of the Flood Relief Committee, if he knew that officials were engaged in corruption, he would naturally handle it according to administrative disciplinary measures or ask Chairman Song to investigate. There was no need to file an accusation with his name. The Flood Relief Committee operated in groups, and this matter belonged to the scope of the disaster area working group. Although he was a standing committee member, he only attended meetings a few times, so he did not know the contents of this matter and could not make presumptions about right and wrong. No matter how this case proceeds, he would not want to be involved. He has already published a statement in the newspaper that he did not participate in the named accusation, and the court will not ask him to testify. Xu will take the night train to Beijing tomorrow to attend the Three Provinces Righteous Relief Association, and then take the Jiangxin ship to Wuhan to meet Chiang.</p>
<p>Detective Team Interrogates Long Lin and Others, Confessing to Assassinating Important Figures</p>
<h3>Sent to the Third Section of the Public Security Bureau for Review</h3>
<p>Twenty-three men and women, including Long Lin, Tang Ming, and Ma Yijin, suspects in the case of throwing bombs at the residences of important figures of the Party and the State such as Song Ziwen, Wang Jingwei, and Wu Tiecheng in the French Concession, with the aim of assassination, have been successively apprehended by Chinese and foreign detectives of the Laozha Patrol Room of the Public Concession and handed over to the First Special District Court for interrogation. Because the case concerned plotting to assassinate important figures of the Party and the State, the court approved their transfer to the detectives of the Detective Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation. After interrogation by Team Leader Lu of the Detective Team, it was found that suspect Qin Wangsheng had fled back to his ancestral home in Wuxi. Detectives were immediately dispatched to Wuxi to cooperate with the police detectives of the county Public Security Bureau to arrest Qin at No. 47 Shiqian Street. After Lu questioned him in detail for more than ten days, he prepared a written confession with the confessions of each suspect, signed and fingerprinted by each suspect, and yesterday submitted it to the Third Section for review. It is reported that Long Lin and others have confessed to throwing bombs in front of the residences of various important figures and plotting assassinations.</p>
<h3>Yang Jingfang, Leader of the Kidnapping Case of a Wealthy Family in Chuansha</h3>
<p>Nickname: Black Skin A Mao</p>
<p>Transferred to the Water Police Station Yesterday</p>
<p>Cai Guisong, a wealthy resident of Caijia Road, Chuansha County, Pudong, was suddenly kidnapped by more than 20 kidnappers around 4:00 PM on October 12, 1928, and a huge ransom was demanded. After his family prepared the ransom and redeemed him, Cai died within a year. Detectives of the First District of the Jiangsu Water Police Provincial Public Security Team arrested four kidnappers in this case, Huang Juechu, Jiang Yangen, Wang Guocai, and Lin Akui, and handed them over to the Songhu Garrison Command for sentencing. During the interrogation, Huang and others confessed that the leaders of the case were two people from Chuansha, Yang Jingfang (also known as Yang Wei, also known as Little Yang) and a person nicknamed Black Skin A Mao. The Garrison Command obtained Yang's photo and issued arrest warrants No. 919 and No. 941, ordering their arrest. Xu Pucheng, Director of the First District of the Provincial Public Security Team, learned that Yang Jingfang was now opening the Dalu Construction Factory on Sichuan Road in Shanghai, and every morning he had to take his own car No. 8690 to the office of the Dalu Construction Factory at No. 47 Ningbo Road. He personally supervised Chief Detective Luo Daokun to come to Shanghai, contacted the Chief Inspector of the General Patrol Room, and requested assistance in the arrest. Chief Detective Lu Liankui, together with Chinese Detective Shen Tianbao and Zhou Honglin, arrested Yang at the address the day before yesterday. They found a licensed self-defense lotus pistol and six bullets on him, took them back to the patrol room for detention, and yesterday morning, transferred him to the First Criminal Tribunal of the First Special Court. Criminal Judge Qian Hongye ascended the bench for interrogation. Yang Jingfang hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend him. Lawyer Ru Baoyi of the patrol room stated that the Water Police Station requested the transfer. If they could provide substantial evidence that the defendant had committed a crime, the patrol room would not oppose it. Director Xu then filed the case, submitting the confessions of accomplice Wang Guocai and the arrest warrant from the Garrison Command to prove that the defendant Yang Jingfang was suspected of kidnapping for ransom and requested permission for the transfer. Yang Jingfang denied having committed kidnapping and claimed that in addition to opening the Dalu Construction Factory, he also served as a counselor for the Ministry of Finance, a counselor for the Water Police Headquarters, a counselor for the Independent Brigade of the 88th Division, and an inspector for the Jianghai Customs Supervisory Office. He was being framed. Lawyer Fan opposed the transfer. Lawyer Ru of the patrol room expressed the opinion that since the representative of the Water Police Station had provided substantial evidence proving that the defendant had committed a crime, the patrol room had no objection to the request for transfer. Judge Qian then ruled in court that Yang Jingfang should be allowed to be transferred.</p>

<p>Human Hearts Are Unpredictable</p>
<h3>Robber Soundly Sleeping in the Victim's Home</h3>
<p>The Liang Xuefu robbery case was initiated by the clan member Xue Wen. While the robbery was taking place, he was soundly sleeping. The robbers Xu Shuming, Xu Huaizhen, Wu Lianshengzi, Zhao Wenbao, Lu Lizhi, Dong Yonghong, Fei Shao, Liang Xuewen, and Xue Li, were all from Siyang Jiangbei. Around 1:00 AM on the 23rd of this month, they used weapons to rob the home of Liang Xuefu, a person from Yancheng, in a bungalow without a number on Yangshupu Road, escaping with jewelry and clothing worth 211 yuan. At that time, they also raped the 19-year-old girl Liang Xiaomei. The day before the case occurred, Chinese Detective Lu Gengsheng and Yang Peisheng of the Yulin Road Patrol Room, in cooperation with Chinese and foreign detectives, arrested them successively at No. 680 Yanshan Road, No. 34 Songpan Road, and No. 124 Longjiang Road, seizing a portion of the original stolen clothing and a chiming clock, along with the woman Chen Xu and the receiver of stolen goods Zhu Guorui, a total of twelve people, and took them into the patrol room for separate detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Tribunal of the First Special District Court. Lawyer Zhang Tianyin of the patrol room stated that the patrol room accused the first defendant Xu Shuming to the tenth defendant Chen Xu and other ten people of robbery, the eleventh defendant Zhu Guorui of receiving stolen goods, and the twelfth defendant Xu Deyou of being detained for investigation. The fourth defendant Zhao Wenbao and the sixth defendant Dong Yonghong were additionally charged with rape, and Xu Shuming, Xu Huaizhen, Wu Lianshengzi, Lu Lizhi, and Fei Shaoyu were additionally charged with assisting in rape. The victim Liang Xiaomei was examined by a doctor at Renji Hospital, who found that her hymen had been ruptured for a long time. Whether she was a virgin would be further investigated. Three pieces of the original stolen silk clothing were found at the home of the defendant Zhu Guorui, and ten pieces of former clothing were found at the home of the third defendant Xu Huaizhen. The woman Chen Xu was the already married daughter of the first defendant Xu Shuming. A chiming clock, the original stolen item, was found at her place. The girl Liang Xiaomei identified that she had been raped by Zhao Wenbao and Dong Yonghong in turns. The initiator of the robbery was the eighth defendant Liang Xuewen. Liang was a member of the victim's clan. He contacted the ninth defendant Wang Xueli, who invited the fifth defendant Lu Lizhi and others to carry out the robbery. When the incident happened, Liang Xuewen was still sleeping soundly in the victim's home. The circumstances of the case are complicated. Please postpone a detailed investigation and present the stolen goods for inspection. Judge Zhao Linyu reviewed the report and questioned each defendant slightly.</p>
<p>The court ordered that they be returned to detention separately for further questioning at a later date.</p>

<p>Ancient Collection of Books, Paintings, and Antiques Exhibition</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, a shooting occurred in Siwen Lane, Datong Road, Xinzha Road. The circumstances are as follows: Hao Mingnian, 39 years old, from Liyang, lived at No. 1013 Siwen Lane and worked as a fruit vendor. A couple named Cao lived in the front building at No. 1040. They usually purchased fruit from Hao on credit since they were acquaintances. Cao's name was Boqian, 30 years old, from Anhui. His wife, Zhang, was the same age as Cao. Yesterday, Cao's friend Wang Shaoxi, 24 years old, from Yangzhou, happened to come to Shanghai from Nanjing and visited Cao's residence. Hao also went to Cao's place to calculate the fruit bill. At the same time, there was also a Wu Xiu, 28 years old, from Shandong, present. So the four people met and chatted with each other. Cao's wife, Zhang, was also beside them. Not long after, two people suddenly came from downstairs, both wearing short clothes, went straight up the stairs, and rushed into Cao's room. Seeing five people chatting, they pulled out their pistols and fired at the five people, about ten shots, without asking for any reason. Seeing that all five were injured, they quickly turned around, went downstairs, and escaped. Neighbors nearby heard the gunfire and hurriedly reported it. A large number of detectives were dispatched to the scene and questioned the injured people, but to no avail. The Xinzha Fire Brigade was notified to send an ambulance to transport the injured people to Baolong Hospital for treatment. Wang Shaoxi was the most seriously injured, with a head injury, and died at 5:30 PM due to lack of treatment. The hospital reported it to the patrol room, which sent the body to the morgue for autopsy. The other four people, Hao Ming, suffered a left arm and mouth injury. The bullet was removed after arriving at the hospital. Cao Boqian suffered a left eye injury. His wife, Zhang, suffered a left arm injury. Wu Xiu suffered a mouth injury and a broken right leg, which was quite dangerous. After the incident, the patrol room paid great attention to the case and sent detectives to pursue and arrest the culprits for investigation. It is reported that a suspect was arrested that night.</p>
<h3>Illegal Recruitment Agency Busted on Qimei Road</h3>
<p>▲Thugs Illegally Recruiting Soldiers</p>
<p>▲Extorting and Robbing Without Doing Any Evil</p>
<p>▲Secret Police Searched and Found Symbols</p>
<p>▲Five Criminals were Pleasurably Smoking</p>
<p>Li Yaozong, the director of the third sub-station of the fifth district of the Public Security Bureau of Zhabei, recently received a confidential report claiming that thugs and local bullies in the Tangli Nine area of Qimei Road in the Shajing Port area were illegally establishing recruitment agencies and extorting money. Director Li secretly ordered the patrol officer Zhang Pengyi to lead armed police officers to secretly capture the criminals yesterday morning around 9:00 AM. When the police officers entered the premises, they saw five people gathered inside, enjoying smoke on their beds. The police officers immediately ordered them to stand up and searched them. Various types of symbols such as "Recruitment Office for Old Zhejiang Nationals of the National Revolutionary Army's Eighty-eighth Division," "Recruitment Office for Old Zhejiang Nationals of the National Revolutionary Army's Eighty-seventh Division," and "Fourth Regiment of the Tax Police of the Ministry of Finance" were found. The police officers brought the smoking paraphernalia and the five people back to the police station together. After strict interrogation, it was revealed that one person was Xia Genlin, 21 years old, from Shanghai, another was Yang Quansheng, 27 years old, a coppersmith, another was Zhu Zhen, in his teens, from Shanghai, currently serving as the recruitment administrator for the Eighty-seventh Division's Old Zhejiang Nationals, another was Chen Yaosheng, 29 years old, from Shanghai, currently serving as the clerk of the Recruitment Office for the Eighty-eighth Division's Old Zhejiang Nationals, and another was Xia Zhirun, a 26-year-old from Shanghai, living at Tangli Nine, Qimei Road, which was his residence. When questioned about other points, they stubbornly defended themselves and pushed the responsibility to each other. Director Li believed that the situation was serious. At the same time, he learned that there were accomplices hiding elsewhere, so he ordered that the people be temporarily detained and that their accomplices be arrested and dealt with together.</p>
<h3>Municipal Public Works Bureau Cracks Down on Dockyard Gangsters</h3>
<p>▲Stating that They Should Be Ignored</p>
<p>Since the Municipal Public Works Bureau took over the Hudong dockyards, it has been very strict in cracking down on dockyard gangsters, vagrants, and extortionists. Anyone who is caught engaging in this kind of activity and whose behavior is less serious will be turned over to the district office for detention, fines, and warnings. However, those who instigate and direct these activities and who repeatedly commit crimes will be sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for transfer to the Shanghai Vagrant Work and Training Center for education. Since then, the order of the dockyard has been temporarily stabilized. However, the gangsters are very resourceful. In addition to being resentful, they have created various rumors to threaten the bureau. A certain lawyer has stated that he will file a lawsuit against the responsible personnel for restricting freedom. The Public Works Bureau recently reported this situation to the Municipal Government for instructions. It is reported that the Municipal Government believes that the supervision of vagrants is a legitimate administrative punishment. The Public Works Bureau was instructed yesterday to ignore the lawyers. The original order is as follows: “Report acknowledged. According to Article 6 of the Administrative Enforcement Law, direct coercive measures can be taken against people to supervise them. At the same time, Article 7, Paragraph 5, stipulates that "other actions deemed necessary for rescue or harmful to public safety, which cannot be rescued or prevented without supervision, may be subject to direct coercive measures." Dockyard vagrants, extortion, and robbery are sufficient to obstruct travelers and disrupt public safety. The Bureau is preventing hazards by sending vagrants to the Work and Training Center for reformation and education. This kind of lawful disposition is appropriate. The lawyer's statements should be ignored. Know this and inform others.”</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Thoroughly Investigates Gambling Dens in Zhabei</h3>
<p>▲Actually Claiming They Mistook It for the Concession</p>
<p>▲Ordered to be Released on Bail for Detailed Interrogation and Punishment</p>
<p>Wen Hongen, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, previously received an order from the Municipal Government, stating that in the Zhabei area, some people were organizing large-scale gambling dens. Their surface name was a club or association, hoping to provide merchants with places for leisure and entertainment after work, and to establish contact and restore Zhabei after the war. In fact, there were various types of gambling such as Pai Gow, shaking stalls, and Fan-Tan. Director Wen went in person to capture them and brought them to the bureau for legal action. However, the gambling den at No. 757 foreign house on the boundary between the Chinese and French Concessions on North Sichuan Road in the territory of the First Sub-station of the Fifth District was the most grand in scale. Director Wen secretly ordered Jin Gong, the director of the Fifth District, to lead the police to capture Zheng San, Liang Ji, the tea room staff, and fourteen others. After being handed over to the bureau, Zheng Liang and others confessed that although the gambling den had been established, they initially mistook the land for the concession and did not expect it to be under the jurisdiction of the Chinese area, so they did not dare to open it. As for the gambling equipment captured, it was only for the company's own people to use for leisure and they did not dare to collect commissions. The case was reviewed by the Third Section and found to be an attempted gambling. They were released on bail after a small fine. This happened a month ago. Now, it is reported that the Municipal Government found that the gambling den at No. 757 North Sichuan Road was intentionally set up by a certain foreigner colluding with unscrupulous Chinese people, intending to undermine the municipal administration and find an excuse. The owner Zheng was a famous traitor. He had already admitted that he mistook it for the concession, so he had not yet opened it. However, based on his intentions and actions, he had already committed the crime of opening a gambling den and collecting commissions for profit. The Municipal Government had previously instructed the Municipal Public Security Bureau to release Zheng San and the other fourteen people who had been lightly fined and released on bail. They should be released on bail for a detailed investigation and punished to the full extent of the law to deter others in the future.</p>
<p>Flower Gambling Harms People</p>
<h3>Zhu Bingqing Commits Suicide After Accumulating a High Debt</h3>
<p>Zhu Bingqing of No. 202 Observatory Road, French Concession, 22 years old, was a vendor of incense. Recently, he had a fondness for flower gambling, which led to him accumulating a high debt. Ashamed, he conceived the idea of death and swallowed raw opium in secret. After being discovered, he was sent to Renji Hospital by car for treatment, but he died at around 4:00 AM yesterday. The body was transferred to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall to await the court's autopsy report.</p>
<p>A Young Woman Hangs Herself after Her Husband Has Been Gone for Three Years</p>
<h3>How Sad</h3>
<p>A local woman, surnamed Xu, whose maiden name was Xiang, was 22 years old. Her father-in-law, Xiang Dongsheng, ran a Xietai pig butchering business at No. 30 Yihua Lane, North Chengdu Road, where they both lived. Three years ago, she married her husband, Xiang Hualin. Unexpectedly, only two months after their marriage, her husband left home and never returned. To this day, there is no news of him. Although her family sent people out in all directions to search for him, they found nothing. She longed for her husband day and night, hoping he would return home soon so they could live as husband and wife. However, her hopes remained unfulfilled, so she lamented her misfortune and developed a desire to end her life. One day recently, taking advantage of the absence of others, she tied a blue cloth belt to a high point on the doorframe outside her bedroom and hanged herself. A neighbor, surnamed Dan, whose maiden name was Zhang, caught a glimpse of her and immediately called the business associates to cut her down. However, she had only a breath left. They immediately reported it to the Xinzha police station, who ordered Detective Ye Yushan to investigate. He then sent her to Guangren Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. She soon died, and her body was taken to the forensic examination center on Fielun Road. Yesterday morning, they reported to the First Special District Local Court, which appointed Prosecutor Guo Wei, along with forensic doctor Zhang Yan and clerk Wang Zuyi, to come to the center to examine the body in accordance with public procedures. According to Zhang, aged 47, she was about to prepare wine and dishes for her young son's wedding. Around 9 p.m. the other day, she went to their house to invite the boss of the butchering business to help slaughter pigs at her place. However, the boss was not at home, so she ran upstairs and saw the deceased hanging outside the door. She was extremely frightened and immediately called people to cut her down, and so on. Xiang Yao said that the deceased was her daughter-in-law. She was not present when she hanged herself. They usually got along very well with her. There was no other reason for this incident. Presumably, it was because her husband was nowhere to be found that she was so frustrated that she committed suicide. After hearing the statement, Guo concluded that the deceased, Xiang Xu, had indeed hanged herself before death. The body was handed over to Zhang, who signed a guarantee to take it back for burial.</p>
<h3>War Report of the National Salvation Army</h3>
<p>Zhu's Chief Commander Attacks Jinzhou. Zhan Tao, the front-line commander-in-chief of the Northeast National Salvation Allied Army, yesterday sent Adjutant Wang Fengqi from the front to Shanghai, carrying a letter from Yu Song, confidential secretary of the Chief Commander's Headquarters, to Zhou Xunyu and others, representatives of the headquarters stationed in Shanghai, reporting on the recent battle situation (the beginning omitted). Our army attacked Yizhou at 3 a.m. on the 19th of this month. The troops included those of Zhan Tao, Shi Lingge, Liu Liangshan, Meng Zhaoyan, Wang Yuanping, and others, totaling more than 5,000 men, with more than 3,000 rifles. The rest were armed with short guns, broadswords, hand grenades, and special forces. The enemy had more than 700 infantrymen, more than 10 machine guns, more than 10 mortars, direct-fire guns, and heavy artillery pieces, one armored train, and two tanks. The two sides fought fiercely for several hours. The southeast gates had been captured by Shi's forces under Zhan Tao's command. At 3 p.m., our army had to temporarily retreat to preserve its strength because the enemy reinforcements from Jinzhou were arriving in large numbers, five planes were bombing, and the enemy troops who had fled from Chaoyang Temple had also concentrated at the Yixi railway station and launched a counterattack with intense firepower. In this battle, each side suffered dozens of casualties. Wang Jingyou and Wang Jingming, the battalion commanders of our guard, were killed in action. The enemy's company commander was killed in action. The most dangerous situation was when Ji Gong (referring to Zhu Jiqing) led more than ten cavalrymen, including attendants, staff officers, and adjutants, to the western gate, where the firepower was most intense, to supervise the attack. If it were not for the effective command, the losses would have been significant. Currently, the headquarters is stationed in a village forty li away from Dama Factory. Today (the 26th), Chief of Staff Song Jiuling was ordered to lead the Cattle and Horse Association and the Ninth Division to attack Jinzhou. Both sides suffered casualties. All the wounded officers and soldiers are still suffering from hunger and cold, and there is a lack of medicine. The situation is dire. I hope you will work hard to publicize this so that our compatriots, seeing this situation, will surely not stand idly by. (The end omitted).</p>
<p>Adjutant Wang Returns North. Adjutant Wang Fengqi, who came to Shanghai from the headquarters, is Adjutant to Shi's forces. He personally experienced the attack on Yixian. He suffered seven injuries on his body. Except for the healed wounds on his legs and arms, his head and lower ribs are still covered with white cloth. It is heard that he will return to the front soon to continue killing the enemy. His bravery is truly admirable.</p>
<p>Shi's Forces Capture Yixian for the Third Time. Shi Lingge, commander of the Sixteenth Route Army, also sent a letter reporting on the battle situation (the beginning omitted). At 3 a.m. on October 19, I attacked the south gate of Yixian. We advanced and retreated three times, and blood flowed like a river. Our army suffered heavy casualties. We are currently concentrating in a certain village to reorganize the troops and prepare to continue attacking Yizhou and Jinzhou. I will report the battle situation in detail later. I am sending Adjutant Wang Fengqi to present everything in person. Please publicize all the circumstances as much as possible so that all compatriots across the country can rise up together to wipe out the strong enemy. Your brother, Shi Lingge.</p>

<h3>And Issues a General Letter Urging Payment of Theater Tickets</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Northeastern Volunteer Army Relief Association sent a letter to Cao Fengchun and Yang Yijie, representatives of the Fourth Route Army of the Liaoning Volunteer Army, stating that it had received a letter dated November 12, relaying that the soldiers at the front were without clothing to ward off the cold, and some were even freezing to death, requesting that cotton clothing be allocated from the donated items for relief. Accordingly, the cotton clothing currently stored by the association had already been allocated to other troops. They had separately purchased 227 sets of military uniforms and allocated another 120 sets from the continuously donated cotton clothing, totaling 347 sets, to be distributed to your righteous army. A corresponding letter is hereby sent, requesting you to check and prepare a receipt to receive them at the association and quickly transport them to the front for distribution.</p>
<p>The association also issued a general letter yesterday to all those who sponsored the theater performance and purchased tickets, stating that in order to raise funds to assist the Northeastern Volunteer Army, the association held a theater performance for two nights on the 20th and 21st of this month at the Tianchan Stage, with the enthusiastic support and generous purchase of tickets, for which we are deeply grateful. As funds are urgently needed and affairs must be concluded, we hereby send a special letter requesting you to submit the ticket funds. If you need us to collect them, please let us know so that we can comply with your wishes.</p>
<h3>All Sectors Provide Relief to the Northeastern Volunteer Army</h3>
<p>Temporary Relief Association. The former Shanghai Municipal Temporary Relief Association has now concluded its accounts, with a net surplus of 10,588 yuan. Yesterday, it allocated the entire amount to the Shanghai Northeastern Refugees Relief Association for transfer to the Northeastern Volunteer Army, and sent a letter to Mu Ouchu, director of the association, stating that the association was established during the January 28 Incident to provide relief to the 19th Route Army. The use of this money for resistance against Japan is still in line with the original purpose. The association will hand over the money to the West Branch of Zhejiang Industrial Bank for collection and issue a receipt to the former Shanghai Municipal Temporary Relief Association for safekeeping.</p>
<p>Postal Workers Union. The Municipal Postal Workers Union believes that the brave soldiers of the Northeastern Volunteer Army are fighting against the brutal Japanese in this icy and snowy region, enduring hunger and cold, and braving the elements, which is extremely pitiful. Yesterday, the union specially allocated 1,200 yuan and remitted it to the Beijing Postal Workers Union for transfer to General Zhu Ziqiao, requesting him to distribute it to the soldiers at the front line, and plans to continue raising funds and remitting them in succession.</p>
<p>Silk Industry Bank. The donation group branch of the Northeastern Refugees Relief Association received a letter from the Silk Industry Bank yesterday, stating that the brutal Japanese are invading our borders and three provinces have changed color. At this time of whistling north winds and mournful barbarian flutes, our Northeastern Volunteer Army is fighting in the icy and snowy fields to defend the nation's dignity and the country's survival. Their spirit of perseverance, determination, and willingness to die is truly enough to move heaven and earth and make the gods weep. All those with blood and qi cannot help but feel sympathy. The uprising of all sectors in this city to provide relief is well justified. The colleagues of our bank, being compatriots, looking upon the bloodshed of the Northeastern Volunteer Army on the mountains and rivers, and their vow to resist Japan to the death, cannot bear to sit idly by. Therefore, after the first bank affairs meeting, it was decided to deduct donations from the salaries of all employees every month, starting from this month, for a period of six months, etc. Now, the donations for this month are collected and sent herewith, totaling 70 yuan. Please check and forward them, and issue separate receipts.</p>
<p>Ningbo Association and others. The Northeastern Volunteer Army Relief Association received donations and relief goods yesterday, among which the following deserve special mention: (1) The entire student body of the private Huamin Elementary School in Xin Garden, East Shudeli, sent a letter stating that although they are young, their enthusiasm for saving the country is no less than that of their fathers and brothers. They are donating their snack money to the righteous army, totaling 20 yuan to date, and are offering it first. Currently, all the students in our school have initiated a monthly donation, with each person donating one copper coin per day. The school has more than one hundred students, so more than ten yuan can be obtained per month. (2) The Ningbo Association sent a letter to the association, requesting to send someone to count the items, including 154 sets of sanitary shirts and pants, totaling three packages, 56 silk cotton vests, 105 old military uniforms, totaling one package, a box of overshoes and running shoes, 110 red blankets, totaling ten packages.

<h3>Xing Zhigang and Others Request Exemption from Bicycle Tax</h3>
<p>Xing Zhigang, the fifth district chief of Shanghai County, together with the fourth district office, filed a public request to the county government yesterday, requesting that it be forwarded to the provincial department for exemption from bicycle tax in rural areas. The public presentation is for forwarding to the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department, requesting exemption from the collection of bicycle tax in remote rural areas to comply with the people's sentiments and demonstrate fairness. According to the investigation, in September of this year, the various district public security bureaus were ordered by the government to carry out bicycle registration and collect vehicle tax. At that time, the local people opposed it because the road construction had not been completed, and they came to the district to request exemption. The Fifth District had previously sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau, reporting the situation to your seat, but it was not approved. However, after reading the promulgated announcement, it stated that urban transportation in various counties is becoming more and more convenient, and the number of bicycles is gradually increasing, in order to seek a method of restraint and management, and this bicycle tax is set up, as if it is issued in prosperous areas, and cannot be compared with the邹区. However, our fourth and fifth districts cover an area of no more than 20 square li. The central part is separated by the 中心河镇 in Nanhui County, bordering the Huangpu River to the west, the Yangsi District of the Special Municipality to the north, and both the southeast sides are adjacent to the border of Nanhui County, forming a intertwined area. They only hold vehicle licenses from this county, and the small, intertwined area makes it difficult to cross the border. This is the first point. According to the investigation, this county has been collecting road construction acreage tax since the 18th year, at five points per mu. The fourth district has more than 32,000 mu of farmland, and the fifth district has more than 25,000 mu of farmland. The annual acreage tax has accumulated to a huge amount, but there has been no construction on road administration. Now, the Humin Road and Beihui Road in Puxi have been completed one after another, but our fourth and fifth districts are far away from the Pujiang River and have not received the same benefits. Under the same county administration, they pay the same annual road construction acreage tax, but the road administration is very different. The chief executives must have already understood this. If you want to collect vehicle tax, you should first complete the road administration. If the road administration is not completed, how can you add taxes? This is the second point. Looking at the perfect road administration in the British and French concessions of Shanghai, only the annual vehicle tax is three yuan. The vast area of Shanghai city is only two yuan per year. It can be seen that the more prosperous the city, the greater the cost of public use, and the heavier the vehicle tax. Now, the remote areas of our county have less road administration and traffic than the city, and they want to pay the annual vehicle tax, even including the license, which is 2.8 yuan, which is too indiscriminate. Moreover, our fourth and fifth districts have no road construction, and the scope is extremely narrow. There are only a few bicycles that pass through the countryside and difficult paths. The difficulty of driving is self-evident, and if you want to collect vehicle tax again, it will be higher than in the city, how can you show fairness and convince the people? The district chiefs and others, considering the public opinion, are unable to remain silent. They dare to appeal to the hanging judge, forwarding to the provincial department, and considering the actual situation, granting exemption, in order to comply with the people's sentiments and demonstrate fairness. This presentation was drafted by the fifth district office and jointly stated.</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Sends Letter to Public Works Bureau Requesting Widening of Bridges in Jiangwan District</h3>
<p>The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent a letter to the Municipal Public Works Bureau regarding the request to widen the bridges in the Jiangwan district, stating: We received a letter from the Jiangwan Office of several associations, stating that the streets in this district have already been widened after the war. However, the bridges have not been reconstructed, resulting in many defects where they connect with the streets. Recently, vehicles passing by have frequently overturned, causing alarming risks to life. We hereby submit this document to your association, requesting that you forward it to the Municipal Public Works Bureau, urging them to promptly dispatch workers to widen the important bridges in this district, such as Xianghua Bridge, Wan'an Bridge, and Niulangmiao Bridge, all of which are essential routes for pedestrians and vehicles, to facilitate traffic and ensure safety. The Chamber believes that the width of bridges should be appropriately proportional to the width of the streets to avoid danger. The request to prioritize the widening of important bridges in the district is for the sake of maintaining public safety. We hereby send this letter to your bureau for your consideration and action, expressing our sincere friendship.</p>

It opened on October 2nd of this year, employing Gu Bingyao and Qian Yangsheng as managers and Xing Shenzhi as a runner. After the business started, many depositors joined, adding deposits. However, Zhu and the other two soon withdrew all their share capital, causing the qian zhuang to be unable to pay due amounts. Several depositors, including Dunyu Cloth Shop, filed a complaint with the General Inspectorate, accusing the qian zhuang of fraudulent acquisition of wealth. Hua Detective Gao Zhen investigated and went to the qian zhuang to arrest the suspects, only to find that it was already deserted. He then arrested Xing Shenzhi in room 372 of the Dajiangnan Hotel and handed him over to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention, as reported in this newspaper. Now, Detective Gao has also arrested Zhu Ruixiang at Maofeng Ironworks. Due to his illness, he was sent to the Public Works Bureau Hospital for treatment. Yesterday was the date set for the trial. The detective's lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, stated that Zhu had not yet recovered and could not leave the hospital, requesting that the case be postponed. Zhu's lawyer requested permission for him to be released on bail for medical treatment. Judge Liu Yugui reported and ordered that the case be rescheduled. Zhu Ruixiang's request for bail was denied.</p>

<h3>The Destination of Life</h3>
<p>— Jing Ji</p>
<p>Try to think about the mystery of life. How can it be answered?</p>
<p>Life, the world: ants building nests, busy without end: but why?</p>
<p>Humans have a conscience: is there a soul? Could it be that so-called good and evil, merits and demerits, have no rewards or punishments!</p>
<p>You have to think: there is a recording machine. Your voice, appearance, smiles, all have ways to be preserved.</p>
<p>Think again: there is photography. Every action can leave a mark like in a mirror.</p>
<p>Then, I must ask: what about spiritual phenomena, superhuman activities?</p>
<p>Based on the concept of scientific progress, we can fully imagine that in the darkness, there is already a special device that fully records the merits, demerits, good, and evil of life!</p>
<p>You dare not do ugly things in front of the public. You do them secretly, or want to do them: you think no one can detect them. If there is a possibility of being detected, you will definitely be ashamed and dare not do them. Now that you clearly understand that there is a special device that specifically manages the issues of conscience, recording all your secret activities, thoughts, and ideas, everything: then, why don't you reflect on yourself, cultivate yourself, and move forward on the path of light?</p>
<p>What ten eyes see and ten hands point at: nothing is more hidden than the hidden, nothing is more obvious than the subtle: what is it if not the creator who cannot leave things? With this caution... Even if wrongdoing is extremely small, resolutely do not do it: dare not offend Heaven!</p>
<p>The great Greek philosopher first spoke of knowing oneself. Scholastic philosophy teaches people humility: broad learning, knowing "nothing"... Before the creator, confess and admit to oneself... "Before You, the most supreme, I prostrate myself in the midst of my nothingness!" Only then can one succeed as a great person!</p>
<p>If the world knew, I would be gone around the age of one hundred: what is the destination of my being me?</p>
<p>Who Sends War Robes</p>
<h3>| I Want to Ask You |</h3>
<p>— Cheng Luding</p>
<p>Outside Shanhaiguan, a deep, silent night. Shua shua, the sound of white poplars evades the sad horns: qi qi, wild ghosts cry among the yellow tombs: misty and dreamlike, the graves, the mounds, the desolate wilderness, the illusory, the dead, what is the oppressive darkness? It is death, it is the devil, also stretching out the hands of the giants! Partridges jump and nightingales whistle; villages, rivers, bamboo houses, farmland, the shattered mountains and rivers, will they never return? No, there are sparks of stars there, the fire of life is burning, and it is the fire that has erupted!</p>
<p>The pursuers of strength, the cleansers of blood, this group of them, the groaning times, the haggard China, is there such a group? But the sparks have already jumped into view, they are ringing the blood bell.</p>
<p>The moon, hazy, hangs in the sky. In the sky, there are tails of clouds, the eyes of stars. The wind blows, not chilling their courage, not cooling their blood. The reed grass is like a broken flute, the fallen leaves are like a broken zither. The wild geese are singing, even if it is a plaintive song of ancient love, can these move their fossil-like hearts?</p>
<p>The night is long, never entering a dream. The ground is covered with silver snow. Nerves and blood vessels have all sown the seeds of sacrifice. On their hearts is planted a great flag of resistance! Rumble, rumble, the cannon roars. Pa, pa, the gun cries. Purple smoke, red flowers, blood-like flames surround them. What does it matter to die? Glorious death, victorious death, has certainly created a sacred altar! But those who have not died are still fighting, which is also a ten-thousand-mile iron city of China. Drinking dew, swallowing snow, this is their life! Bathing in blood, holding back tears, this is their education! But now it is cold, strive to send war robes! This is also our responsibility! Then...who is sending war robes after all? I want to ask you all!</p>
<p>Suggestions for Banner Shoes</p>
<h3>| Block Leaky Cups, Combine Hygiene, and Suit Aesthetics |</h3>
<p>— Tao Zaidong</p>
<p>High-heeled leather shoes, priced from several yuan to dozens of yuan, are statistically exported at over one million yuan per month, so the annual leaky cup is over 12 million yuan, an astonishingly large number. Thus, there is a slogan of shouting down leather shoes. Since this trend has already formed, how can slogans bring them down? The plan is no better than replacing them with domestic goods. Therefore, there are suggestions for banner shoes.</p>
<p>Banner shoes and cheongsam were originally the attire of Manchu noblewomen. Now, the cheongsam is popular, but if one only wears the cheongsam but not the shoes, it is learning only half of it, is it not a pity! The beauty of banner shoes lies in the sole, which is flat on top and sharp on the bottom, making an oval or cup-shaped shape, with a height of one inch or so. The height is in the center of the foot, which is no different in function from the height in the heel.</p>
<p>The reason why women like high-heeled leather shoes is not because they like the leather, but because the high heels suit their love of beauty. The figure of a beauty should be tall, and high heels increase the height: the posture of a beauty should be steep, and high heels help the steepness: tall means slender, and steep means handsome, this is the advantage, which banner shoes also have. Its height is in the middle, and the sway is even more charming. When standing tall, when walking gracefully, Liang Shou's steps bend his waist, and Fei Yan's shape trembles like a flower: about to leave and suddenly close, seemingly going but returning, its beauty is in the spirit, which high heels cannot achieve. Look at the princess in the drama "Visiting the Mother," taken by famous actors such as Mei Lanfang, can it be said that it is not beautiful? Moreover, high heels sprain the heels and injure the toes, constricting the muscles and blood, which is extremely unhygienic, no different from bound foot shoes, but banner shoes do not have this problem, and not only this.</p>
<p>Brocade, embroidery, gold, and jade are accessories for beauties, like a famous general's horse and a knight's sword. However, the brilliance and solemnity of the whole body are limited to leather when it comes to the feet, instantly diminishing the color. If they are banner shoes, not only the shoes themselves can be innovated, but they can also be adorned with Dongzhu pearls and inlaid with diamonds, adding as many rare treasures as possible, which is the most beautiful and perfect. However, there is still progress. I have seen Manchu noblewomen hollow out the soles of their shoes, making them in the shape of Ruyi, eight knots, and petals, filling them with purple and white fragrant powder, so that their steps were imprinted on the ground carpets and felts, which can be called gorgeous traces. I have also seen small clocks embedded in the sole surface, looking down to check the time, which can now be improved to install wireless radios. I also remember Ms. Deling's diary of the Qing palace, that it was inconvenient to change to Manchu clothing at first, but after a long time it was comfortable, praising the beauty of the neck scarf and banner shoes, which has also been proven by someone.</p>
<p>In short, replacing leather shoes with banner shoes is hygienic, aesthetic, and restores profits and rights, all in one step. Do my sisters have any intention? In particular, I hope that famous women, socialites, and celebrities will lead by example and resolutely promote this, so that this proposal is not in vain. I, Zaidong, am sincerely happy and respectfully say, bowing my head to the point of death.</p>
<h3>Interesting Fragments from School</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>1.  Fragrant and Stinky Fighting in the Classroom</p>
<p>If there were a few more Misses in this classroom, you could smell enough of that cream smell in the first class of the morning. But when the third class began, each of their plump buttocks brought a cloud of toilet smell, and the classroom suddenly became a battle of fragrant and stinky smells, the kind of smell that would make you shout that you couldn't stand it.</p>
<p>2.  Always Getting the Cold Shoulder</p>
<p>Among the letters delivered by the postman to the gatekeeper, the girls are the most eager to quickly read them. Often some mischievous boys would gently lock them inside, and then they would be like spoiled orioles locked in golden cages, jumping and shouting, getting the cold shoulder before finally being released.</p>
<p>3.  Fair Thief</p>
<p>In our experimental elementary school, there is a stove with three pots, and all kinds of utensils are complete. Currently, we only need one pot, which is enough. Unexpectedly, one night, a thief dug a hole and stole a large pot, a small pot, and pot lids, leaving a complete large pot for us to boil water and wash our faces. He took what he needed, and I abandoned what I didn't need, which shows that he understands the principle of being a thief who "does school" and being a fair thief.</p>
<h3>Crystallization of Comedy</h3>
<p>— Zhuo Fuling</p>
<p>I once said... Comedy, comedy, talking about it is not easy, people think that what is unreasonable is comedy; making people laugh is also comedy. But that's not the case. What is called comedy must contain the ultimate truth in the absurdity, and it must be interesting and profound, so that it is deeply imprinted in people's minds and can never be forgotten, which is the best kind of comedy. Liu Chunshan is a famous comedic friend in Shanghai. His speech, although it seems like nonsense, is only enough to make people laugh; but if you savor its meaning, it is like chewing olives. Now, Mr. Liu cannot fully express his talent through speech and singing, so he is making a comedic film called "Chicken and Duck Couple," which is about 10,000 feet long. The content is not only enough to make people laugh, but also to make them spit out snacks and milk. The cast, in addition to Mr. Liu as the protagonist, includes Qian Wuliang, Ding Guai Guai, Zhao Xixi, Sheng Daidai, Lu Xixi, Lu Qiqi, Jiang Xiaoxiao, Bao Lele, etc., all the famous comedic talents in Shanghai are included.</p>
<p>Short Message: The semi-monthly magazine "Long Live" edited by Zhang Qiuchong has rich content and many famous works. The eighth issue is now published, and because the readers' championship meeting is announced, and more famous works have been added, the publication date has been slightly delayed. The main points of this issue include "Ten Thousand Miles of Rivers and Mountains," "Secrets of Being an Official," "Historical Records of Shanghai's Brothels," "Supermen and Non-Humans (Part Two)," "Random Flowers Falling," and dozens of other articles. None of them are masterpieces of elaborate structure. Anyone who subscribes directly before the end of November will still be charged at the preferential rate.</p>
<h3>The Crossroads of Death (25)</h3>
<p>— Fan Yan</p>
<p>7.  This Heart is Still Yours</p>
<p>The retreat of the ×× Road Army to the second line of defense has been confirmed. However, several lower-ranking officers remained in Shanghai for clandestine work. Liu A'gen of Cuiwei Village had gradually risen from the soldier Liu Gensheng and had become Liu Gengsheng, the deputy company commander, during the resistance against the Japanese soldiers. He was also assigned to clandestine work in Shanghai. One day, he went to the Southeast Hotel to find the company commander but didn't find him. As he was about to take the elevator down, he saw a woman standing at the elevator entrance. Normally, Shanghai women were just more stylishly dressed, with nothing else particularly noteworthy. Besides, at a hotel elevator entrance, countless stylishly dressed women came and went all day long. Liu Gengsheng, who had fought hand-to-hand with the world's most savage soldiers on the front lines, didn't pay much attention. He believed that looking at women too much would diminish his heroic spirit. Although his comrades in the same army liked to hang out with female comrades to alleviate their work fatigue, he was unwilling for a woman to gamble on the life and death of a soldier or for a soldier during "the Hun's extermination" to be bound and infatuated with a woman. Therefore, in these years of unstable movement from Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and then from Zhejiang to Jiangsu, he had long forgotten A'gu completely. Although he had not seen A'gu for many years, the darkness of A'gu's hands tanned like soy sauce by the sun, the whiteness of her naturally beautiful neck that she had no time to adorn, always existed and could be recalled at any time. The woman standing in front of him was certainly different from A'gu. No matter how quickly things changed, A'gu would never become like this. This was beyond doubt. What made him pause slightly was that the woman's eyes were fiercely fluid and possessed a certain power. Therefore, he was just waiting for the elevator in boredom, but the elevator still hadn't arrived.</p>
<p>The woman also became a little impatient. She reached out to press the elevator bell button on the iron railing, then retracted her hand. Casually, she brushed her forehead, pushing aside a little of the curled fringe covering her left forehead. The perm was curled "neither too tight nor too loose" by the electric iron. After her hand came down, it returned to its original position, covering her left forehead like an awkwardly drawn circle in ink. But this action stirred Liu Gengsheng's heartstrings, causing them to clang and jump. He pondered to himself, asking and answering:</p>
<p>"Eh! She also has a scar, also on her left forehead... There are people who look alike in the world. I heard Mr. Feng say in private school that Confucius and Yang Huo looked similar... No: they're not this similar. The more I look, the more she looks like her. Her eyebrows are much thinner, I can't tell anymore. But her eyes won't change, although they're more fluid than before... Ah! Do I really think it's A'gu? Why do I need to say 'than before!'..."</p>

<h3>The Financial and Gold Market Reaches a New Peak</h3>
<p>丨Seven Hundred and Seventy Taels, Three Mace丨</p>
<p>(Market Price Advances Urgently) The market yesterday was brisk. The morning market was flat, but the afternoon market became increasingly firm, frequently seeing new high prices. However, the trading range was mostly two taels. The overall market had a fluctuation of five taels and six mace. In the end, it rose three taels and eight mace compared to the previous day. The industry's sentiment leaned towards higher prices, and there were more buyers than sellers. Initially, the exchange rate fell by more than one cent. Although the big bars of the American Bank rose, they were not valued because there was no market for short-term transactions. The market opened high but then declined slightly due to more sellers. Later, because the exchange rate was expected to tighten next year and because foreign news reported that the United States denied using other countries' paper money and stocks to repay war debts, insisting on using US dollars, the market was stimulated. Buyers acted boldly, and the price rose sharply, nearly reaching seven hundred and seventy taels. Later, a new price of seventy taels and three mace was seen. The price then fell slightly, fluctuating by about one tael. Afterwards, it stood around sixty-nine taels. As for the December-to-January swap, the shorts aggressively offered and Fuchang accepted over five hundred bars, posting three taels and two mace. It is said that the Dalian and Guangdong gangs mostly completed their swaps. The detailed events of the entire day are as follows:</p>
<p>(Extremely Promising Morning Session) The January opening immediately rose one tael and five mace to seven hundred and sixty-six taels and six mace, followed by fluctuations of two or three mace. Then, Yuan Maoyong, Yuan Xiang, Yuan Chun, Hengyu, and Yuan Tai sold, and the bank traded January US dollars at 3.75, immediately depreciating the price by two taels to sixty-four taels and eight mace. Hengxing entered the market to buy, immediately adding several mace, reaching sixty-five taels and four or five mace at 9:30 AM. HSBC's listed price remained unchanged, but Hong Kong added 0.25. Yuan Maoyong, Yifeng, Yuan Zhaofeng, Chang Hengyu sold, causing the price to fall to four taels and seven mace. The current month's US dollars were traded at 0.25 by Citibank and British Bank, and 0.625 by Xiansheng, which involved currency arbitrage. However, the gold price remained flat, staying around five taels. Later, the December US dollars were traded at 0.25, and Bombay entered at 0.25, so the price was five taels and seven mace at 10:20 AM. Yuan Heng, Yuan Chun, Wupin, and Yuan Tai sold. Then, Mitsui released January US dollars at 3.75, bringing the price to four taels and eight mace after 10:30 AM. Afterwards, the price rose slightly by several mace. Around 10:00 AM, news suddenly spread that the United States would not allow currencies to be used to repay debts. Traders predicted that the exchange rate might fall again. Hongkang, Yong Yuanmao, Yuan Kangxiang, Hengyu, Hengxing, Fuyu, Futai, Hengchang, Yuan Zhaofeng, Changchun, Yuan Yongheng, and Yuan Chun competed to buy, especially as US dollars also strengthened. The Guangdong gang aggressively bought, with January at 0.25 and February at 0.3125. Therefore, the gold price rose steadily, surging five taels. However, the pullback was minimal, less than one tael, until 11:30 AM, when it reached sixty-nine taels and eight mace. Afterwards, the price fluctuated by one tael. It was said that Zhongfu released February US dollars at 3.75, and scattered bulls on the trading floor sold, causing the price to fall sharply by more than one tael. At 11:45 AM, the price was eight taels and five mace, then it rose by six or seven mace, reaching eight taels and nine mace at the noon close.</p>
<p>(New High Prices in the Afternoon Session) The afternoon session opened with a gain of about two, at sixty-nine taels and eight mace. According to foreign news, the former British Chancellor of the Exchequer mentioned American debt, and Britain had expressed its willingness to repay. Therefore, confidence immediately rose. The price then rose from nine taels and two mace to seventy taels and three mace. Dadecheng, Fuyu, Hengchangyong, Yuan Kangxiang, Yuan Tai, Dafengyong and others scrambled to buy. Afterwards, Citibank released December US dollars at 0.125, and Hongkangyong, Hengyu, Zhaofengchang, and Fuchang sold, causing the price to fall slightly to sixty-eight taels and seven mace. Bingxing and others bought, bringing the price to nine taels and a half. Later, from 2:30 PM to 3:00 PM, the price fell by one tael and seven or eight mace, because Zhifengyong, Zhaofengchang, Yifengyong, Dadecheng, and Hengyu sold. The wheat firm also released December US dollars at 0.125, and Korea released February at 0.25, bringing the price to sixty-seven taels and seven mace. Afterwards, there were fluctuations of several mace. Suddenly, at 4:00 PM, Hengxing, Bingxing, Yuanheng, and Yuan Maoyong bought, and Fuchang sought to settle January US dollars at 0.25 to 0.1875, but they couldn't find a counterparty. The gold price surged, reaching seventy taels at 4:15 PM. The Dalian gang and Yongde and others sold, but the volume wasn't smooth. The price was sixty-eight taels and nine mace at 4:20 PM, with fluctuations of five or six mace.

The maximum price for the day was seventy taels and three mace, and the minimum price was sixty-four taels and seven mace, a difference of five taels and six mace. The gross premium was thirteen taels.</p>
<p>(Official Price Reduced by Four Taels) The official price was still eight hundred and thirty-one taels, with the first quotation at sixty-five or sixty-six taels, then sixty-one taels. The noon closing was sixty-two taels, the afternoon sixty-one taels, and the closing price sixty-one taels, a decrease of four taels compared to the previous day. Transactions were recorded from seventy-six taels to sixty-nine taels, with the total margin call for the day at seventy-two taels.</p>

<p>Foreign Exchange: Sterling Flat, US Dollar Tight, US Debt Must Be Repaid in US Dollars</p>
<h3>Shanghai Market Strongly Stimulated</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silver market saw a rise in sterling, but there were no cables regarding the US dollar. However, the sterling-to-US dollar exchange rate has fallen rapidly for five days. Therefore, the trend of Shanghai drafts is unusually tight. HSBC's listed prices for sterling, US dollar, Indian rupee, and Pohe were unchanged. Hong Kong suddenly added 0.25, to seventy-seven taels. German and French currencies contracted slightly. Internal market calculations showed that sterling was initially firm but then weakened, stabilizing in the afternoon. The total contraction was 0.0625, with 100,000 pounds traded. The Dalian gang and silver companies sold, and many interbank transactions occurred. The US dollar was flat and then strengthened, especially tightening in the afternoon. The final result was a contraction of 0.125 compared to the previous day, and the gold price also rose by four taels. According to Reuters, news that US debt must be repaid in US dollars and that Britain was prepared to repay was sufficient to strongly stimulate the Shanghai market. Most Chinese gold firms and Guangdong gang Hengxing and Shengda were actively buying, engaging in arbitrage transactions. Bombay also cabled to purchase for December.

<h3>Yesterday's Financial Market Was Extremely Quiet</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market yesterday morning was already sluggish. However, in terms of sentiment, the remnants of the previous day still lingered, so the atmosphere was still firm. In reality, it was far from as robust as the previous few days. The market gradually softened in the afternoon, and the situation was quite quiet. Silver shipments were also very inactive.</p>
<p>(Margin Call Prices) The early morning "foreign margin" was 7 mace 1 fen and 4 li, which was 0.25 hao higher than the previous noon. The noon market suddenly fell 0.875 to 7 mace 1 fen 3 li 1 hao and 2.5 si, resulting in a decrease of 0.625 hao compared to the previous noon.

Copper coins remained at 398,000 wen, with 38,200 strings transacted, accounting for 9,600 taels of silver.</p>
<p>(Silver and Foreign Silver Inflow and Outflow) Silver shipments at banks yesterday were very weak. Chinese banks received 2.4 to 2.5 million in bills, foreign banks received 1.8 to 1.9 million in bills, special accounts received 1 million, and various goods, exchange taxes, and miscellaneous accounts received 7.7 to 7.8 million.

<h3>Stocks and Bonds Fluctuated</h3>
<p>丨Whole Six Rebounded by Eight or Nine Corners丨</p>
<p>丨Other Trends Extremely Chaotic丨</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 25th), the futures market of the Chinese Stock Exchange was generally good. The atmosphere was quite strong in both the morning and afternoon markets. Bond prices, on the other hand, were approaching delivery, and prices had risen quite high. Therefore, each price shifted based on the temporary supply and demand conditions of the market. Each board saw increases and decreases, which was quite chaotic. Large traders were watching, and most market transactions were swaps, without large new transactions. Among them, the "Whole Six" was the most robust due to strong market demand and rare selling, rising eight or nine corners compared to the previous day. "Demobilization" once saw active selling, decreasing about one yuan compared to the previous day, falling to about 55 yuan. However, the market turned firm again at the close. Others fluctuated, resulting in increases and decreases of only about three or four corners compared to the previous day. Judging from the closing trends, it seemed that market prices would not fall low for the time being. The total spot trading for the day was 25,000 yuan, with futures trading around 4.4 million yuan in the morning and over 3.6 million in the afternoon, totaling 8.06 million yuan.</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton Market: Morning Soft, Afternoon Recovered to Flat</p>
<h3>The Current Month's Cotton Soared by Half a Tael on the Last Day</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market was closed for Thanksgiving. Indian cotton initially followed the US cotton and weakened, then fell due to long positions being liquidated, and finally strengthened due to short positions being covered for profit. The standard yarn market was flat. The morning was slightly soft due to poor current sales and the decline in Indian cotton. In the afternoon, the market was slightly steady due to the urgent covering of short positions in standard cotton. The cotton market was also soft in the morning. In the afternoon, the current month's price soared by five mace due to the liquidation of short positions on the last day, and forward prices were also lifted by about a qian. Current yarn was still weak. Yunnan, Sichuan, Wuhu, Mibo, Inland, and other gangs collectively purchased over 300 bales. All gangs' purchase amounts and prices are listed in the price list below. The current cotton purchase amounts from various parties are attached below.</p>

<h3>Grain and Rice Market: Stable</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were over 40 origin gangs. Due to the rain, there were few customers. Early and late rice prices were slightly soft. Changxi North Japonica and Suzhou Tong gangs' prices were similar to the previous session. Bianyuan wine households were slightly active, with prices firmer by 0.10. Lu Yangjian rice was uneventful.</p>
<p>(Xinzha) Tomorrow, there will be 40-50 origin gangs in the West Road. Due to the continuous light rain, there were not many people in the market in the morning. Thick japonica rice opened 0.05 firmer, thin early double-crop rice arrived with weak sales, and prices loosened. Lu Jian, Yang Jian, Du Jian, and Ke Jian all fell by 0.10. He Xia's contribution opened at 2,000 piculs.</p>
<p>Min Gang Enthusiastically Buying Ke Xian Rice</p>
<h3>Quanzhou and Fujian Gangs Have a Strong Appetite</h3>
<p>Yesterday's rice market was completely stagnant. Even interdealer trades were rare. High Saigon No. 1 rice was only matched at 8.35 yuan. Chen Saigon's entry price was only 7.95 yuan. The market was so sluggish that it had reached an extreme. Only large gangs' purchases could turn the tide. However, the market had over 600,000 bags in inventory, so the situation would not improve.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Ke Xian rice market was quite active because Quanzhou and Fujian gangs had a strong appetite. Fujian gang originally had a huge appetite, but temporarily stopped to avoid competition from other gangs. Yesterday, buying interest suddenly surged, and they competed with Quanzhou, Xiamen, Tianjin, and Yantai gangs. The market price recovered after being weak. 2,200 bags of Hunan machine-processed oil rice were sold at 8.95 yuan, 8.80 yuan, and as low as 8.62 yuan. 800 bags of machine-processed red rice were sold at 8.00 yuan to 7.90 yuan. 183 bags of Jiangxi machine-processed Yuan rice were sold at 9.50 yuan. Furthermore, 147 bags of Wuhu machine-processed Yuan rice of high grade arrived yesterday, and 84 bags were sold at 10.75 yuan, mostly bought by Fuzhou. The Northern gang and Quanzhou only bought several hundred bags of machine-processed oil rice.</p>
<h3>Standard Flour Slightly Brisk</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market: After the morning opening, the market for each month showed an initial flat and then stable trend. The price of foreign wheat was only about eight fen lower than Kan wheat. US wheat was closed with no market. Each month was flat at the opening because there were very few transactions between buyers and sellers. However, because there were very few sellers, sentiment seemed to become firm. The final result was about 5 li better. When the afternoon session opened, trading was extremely quiet. There were many empty sales, because factories were generally watching. There was a slight need from the civilian file customers. Therefore, the market atmosphere was slightly brisk. Given this situation, the subsequent steps should be temporarily revolving. The final results for November-December were 7.5 li better than the previous day, January was 1.5 fen better, February was 7.5 li better, and March-April were 1 fen better.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures: Light Trading, No Price Change</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market: After the morning and afternoon openings, the market for each month remained quiet. Trading in the forward months was still scarce due to limited long-short transactions. Inflow and outflow were stagnant, and there was no price change. The amounts were very small, making it difficult to sell and difficult to buy. This month's delivery was approaching, and although the quantity was small, there was a shortage of spot goods upon maturity, so sentiment remained stable. The closing results were similar, and seemed to be 1-2 fen better compared to a few days ago.</p>
<h3>Chicago Wheat Turned Weak</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported: On Wednesday (the 23rd), Chicago wheat fell about 1 fen in each term due to poor foreign demand and the stock market crash. On the 22nd, 40 million bushels were traded. The market prices on the 23rd are listed below:</p>
<p>| Closing Price | Compared to Previous Day |</p>
<p>| ------------- | ------------------------ |</p>
<p>| December Future | 42.75       Down 1.00           |</p>
<p>| May Future      | 47.50       Down 1.00           |</p>
<p>| July Future     | 48.75       Down 0.875           |</p>
<p>Sugar Market: Raw Sand White Market Firm, Sales Scarce</p>
<h3>New Qing Sugar Also Appeared Sluggish</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market once reached 770 taels, and the market trend turned upward. The guild's listed prices, such as No. 24 raw sand white ordinary goods,成交 (were transacted) at 15 taels and 5 fen, but only several hundred bags. High-quality goods were listed at 15 taels and 2 qian, but few inquired, because actual sales were still not smooth. No. 18 medium sand called for 15 taels and 1 qian, and No. 20 medium sand called for 15 taels and 14 qian, but no transactions occurred. No. 8 Dutch red new goods called for 11 taels and 4 qian, and old goods 11 taels and 2.5 fen, but few were willing to purchase. No. 9 Dutch red new goods called for 11 taels and 6 qian, and old goods 11 taels and 3.5 fen, but purchases were also limited. New Qing sugar, such as Huanggu Qing, continued to open at 9 taels and 2 qian, but because the goods were ordinary, transactions were still rare. The later market was still expected to be soft. Jianbing, such as Wufu white ice, had increased costs, and the owner cabled requesting an adjustment, but the firm,鉴于 (in view of) sluggish sales, was unable to raise prices. Therefore, sporadic sales continued on the original price.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: Tianjin Red Dates Sold Well, Market Stable</h3>
<p>Tianjin red dates have recently had limited sources and active sales, so the market is firm. Yesterday, a batch of over 2,0</p>
<h3>丨Yesterday, 74 Pieces Were Loaded onto the Shanghai-Nanjing Truck丨</h3>
<p>Since the resumption of work by the silk factories in Wuxi, silk production has been increasing daily. However, sales to Europe have not improved, resulting in substantial silk inventories at the factories. As the end of the month is approaching rapidly, some merchants are undertaking to deliver silk for the November futures contracts to various foreign firms, and should deliver on schedule. Therefore, silk is continuously being transported to Shanghai. Yesterday, the Shanghai-Nanjing truck loaded 74 pieces of silk from the silk filature in Wuxi.</p>
<p>Sales of White Silk Heads and Satin are Increasingly Stagnant</p>
<h3>丨Cotton Textile Sales are Booming, While More Silk Filatures are Shutting Down丨</h3>
<p>Since the popularity of modern silk fabrics, the demand for white silk heads such as Changtu, Duantu, cocoon floss, and Tang cocoon has surged, used to weave crepe and other products. Now that winter has arrived and cotton textiles are on the market, sales of modern silk fabrics have plummeted, inventories are piling up, and no one is inquiring. Sales of white silk head satins are increasingly stagnant. Sales of Changtu cocoon floss and other products in Shanghai to Europe have not improved and exports are few. There is no hope for a turnaround in the silk head market for the time being.</p>
<h3>Two Lakes Black Tea Plummets</h3>
<p>According to news from Hankou, the market for black tea from the Two Lakes region in Hankou has almost completely collapsed recently. Sales to the UK have been affected by the low-priced competition from Indian tea, and the British government has reimposed heavy per capita taxes on Chinese tea. Sales to the UK have almost completely ceased. Although the Russian Association for Assisting Tea Production in Hankou has considerable demand, it is an organized body that adheres to a policy of buying only at low prices. As a result, the price of black tea from the Two Lakes region has plummeted from thirty or forty taels to twelve or thirteen taels, causing huge losses for Chinese tea merchants.</p>
<h3>Melton Broadcloth Piece Goods Show Lively Trend</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the broadcloth trade was fairly brisk, with Melton broadcloth showing a very lively trend. Since large quantities were purchased by Tianjin and Hangzhou, the Shanghai market has seen shortages, and the market has gradually improved. With the weather turning cold, actual sales in this street have started, and tailors of Western clothing have seen a sudden increase in demand. All popular colors are selling well, and prices are several fen of silver higher than last week. Yesterday, Ningfeng Dashijiang was selling for one tael, eight qian, seven fen and five li.</p>
<h3>Market Situation of Tung Oil after the New Oil Production</h3>
<p>丨Initial Production Volume Not Strong丨</p>
<p>丨Supplementary Transactions Still Frequent丨</p>
<p>New tung oil has appeared in various producing areas, but the initial output has not been very strong. Buyers are looking to purchase small amounts to build up inventories, so transactions are quite active. Soap factories in this port have also made purchases, with prices reportedly at fifteen taels and three or four qian, weighed at the factory. However, this price is considered too low, so few sellers are willing to sell. Since tung oil from Macheng in Hankou is still at twelve taels and seven or eight qian, it is difficult to make a profit at this price, and it is feared that no one will continue to sell later on. As for the candle making industry, the market remains sluggish. Although it is the time for candlemakers to stock up for the new production season, there are differences in prosperity compared to previous years. According to detailed letters from Hankou in recent days, new tung oil from Macheng has continued to arrive, but in small quantities, so trading has not yet started. It is estimated to be about the same price as old oil. It is reported that the harvest has been good in the Jingyi area, so future production may be stronger than in the past two years. Moreover, with the suppression of banditry in various producing areas, although commerce cannot immediately return to its former state, it can gradually recover. With farmers able to live in peace, agricultural products can also be harvested more freely. In general, the collection of tung seeds will not be as neglected as in previous years, when no one collected them and they were allowed to fall and rot. The expected production volume should increase. However, the harvest in Zhejiang Province varies from area to area. It is estimated that the areas around Jinhua and Lanxi are relatively poor, while the areas around Jiaxing are relatively rich. Therefore, oil pressing workshops in Shaoxing are sourcing tung seeds from western Zhejiang. This is why the tung oil industry in Zhejiang is recovering after a period of weakness. Merchants in this port have very small inventories, because the market is not strong, so they are unwilling to stock up heavily, and only buy and sell as needed.</p>
<h3>Coal Consumption at Coal Factories Decreases</h3>
<p>Recently, most of the silk factories in this port have shut down, resulting in a decrease in coal consumption. Trading in various types of coal, including market lump coal and slack, has decreased significantly, and prices are unstable. Yesterday, lump coal from Boshan in Shandong sold for only nine taels and five qian per ton, Yuesheng lump coal for ten taels, Wang lump coal for seven taels, and Zhongxing slack for ten taels.</p>
<h3>Hardware, Tinplate, and American Goods are Increasingly Popular</h3>
<p>After being sluggish for many days, the market for American tinplate suddenly became optimistic yesterday. Because the supply of standard tinplate is not keeping up with demand, prices have risen by several qian. 90-pound tinplate is estimated at fourteen taels and seven qian and a half, 100-pound tinplate at fifteen taels and seven qian and a half, and 200-pound tinplate at thirty taels. It is reported that there have been many buyers in recent days, and the market is expected to be very optimistic.</p>

<h3>Deformed Worship</h3>
<p>— Tianfang</p>
<p>Worshipping external entities, whether it be concrete actions or abstract philosophies, is originally an upward-striving mentality. However, deformed worship is a kind of morbid state. This morbid state, in my China, perhaps even among Eastern peoples, is fully manifested.</p>
<p>The so-called worshipping mind originally arises from an internal reaction to external entities. Broadly speaking, it lies in the idea of "seeing the virtuous and thinking of emulating them." However, our people are truly content with their lot, too easily satisfied. Most of them "see the virtuous but do not think of emulating them," focusing only on "external observation" while neglecting "internal reflection." They hope that others will perform the play, while they themselves hide on the sidelines watching the excitement, enjoying the fruits of others' labor. In their thoughts, they only see "others" and forget the concept of "self." Therefore, they create a fortunate and fantastical outlook on life, living in a muddled and confused manner.</p>
<p>Examples are not far off. Let us first start with the primitive belief—gods. In Western mythology and legends, the protagonists are all sound and beautiful. In Chinese mythology and legends, the protagonists are either madmen like Ji Dian or cripples like Tieguai Li, mostly ugly,</p>
<p>The orphaned son cries blood, bows his head until it breaks, bows his head, bows his head. The unfilial one and others have not died and instead extend the disaster to their deceased parents. Confused and incoherent, I dare to rely on relatives, friends, and those who hear of this friendship to show their compassion. I announce this in this obituary to my colleagues. I personally saw to the encoffining and followed the rites to don mourning clothes. I respectfully choose the day for the first memorial service.</p>
<p>The obituary is incomplete.</p>
<p>inhuman. When it comes to talents for governing the country, then, we wish to have an almighty true lord above us, for us to admire and praise, for him to rule everything. We wish to enjoy his blessings and live in peace and prosperity. We have never dreamed of 400 million people rising up to become emperors together. In short, we want an all-powerful person to handle everything, rather than everyone possessing a skill or ability to share the work. This is the reason for not reflecting on oneself and not knowing how to emulate others. However, an all-powerful person is ultimately unattainable, so dreams remain dreams in the end.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when it comes to sports—this piece of writing is prompted by the feeling of the deformed development of the sports world today—then, we only want one or two Li Huitang, Dai Linjing, Qiu Feihai, or Lin Baohua to be enough—I certainly do not mean to belittle the skills of you gentlemen—and do not want to universally train the populace. The interest in sports is still only promoted in schools, and schools only focus on cultivating one or two outstanding talents—these students receive very preferential treatment in schools—and do not pay attention to raising the general level. Among this vast population, if we cultivate them, wouldn't there be one or two figures like Li Huitang and Lin Baohua? However, they are buried. This is indeed too far from the meaning of promoting sports. In the final analysis, it is also poisoned by the deformed worship. We must know that now is the era of groups. We must break down the ability to think, break down heroism. We do not want to take the road of gravel, we demand the average not the leap of one or two. Everything is like this, not just sports.</p>

<h3>Famine Relief Ballad</h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>Yesterday, I met Mr. Zhumin, who showed me the three "Famine Relief Ballads" he had written. After reading them once, I couldn't help but shed tears. Therefore, I specially copied them to fill this publication, hoping that the well-fed compatriots in this city will, after reading them, generously show compassion and reduce their clothing and food to relieve these helpless famine victims.</p>
<p>The heavy snow fills the desolate fields, what do the birds love? The male flies to find branches, unable to settle, the female flies to find food, but finds no grain. The old man in the village calls his old partner, sending his son to find firewood to cook breakfast. There is no surplus of beans and wheat in the chest, and we must also guard against the government troops demanding rice and noodles.</p>
<p>The north wind howls, piercing to the bone, the grass sheds are slanted and broken in hundreds of places. The mournful wild geese cry out, with no place to plead, the fields are just a short distance away, when will we return? Although the house is destroyed and the fields are barren, there is still grain stored in the cellar when we return home. The government troops raise bandits and refuse to fight, enduring hunger and cold in vain, feeling sad.</p>
<p>Selling children, they cannot be sold, selling daughters, no one cares. It's not that no one cares, but the government strictly forbids it. They die filling ditches, feeding jackals and wolves. The old are gone, the young are pitiable. What crime have we committed to suffer this calamity? Why are there so many battlefields in the world?</p>

<h3>How to Make Fire Extinguishing Liquid and Fireproof Clothing</h3>
<p>— Gu Xueqiu</p>
<p>City residences are densely packed, like scales arranged next to each other. One careless moment can endanger hundreds of homes. Therefore, in case of fire, the neighboring residences are bound to be in extreme danger. Therefore, there must be fire prevention equipment in the home, to prepare for unforeseen needs. Fire extinguishing liquid and fireproof clothing are easy to manufacture and inexpensive, so I will introduce them below for families to trust and implement.</p>
<h3>Fire Extinguishing Liquid</h3>
<p>Raw Materials: Borax 120 parts, Anhydrous Sodium Carbonate 200 parts, Caustic Soda 300 parts, Ammonium Carbonate 400 parts, Clear Water 200 parts</p>
<p>The manufacture of fire extinguishing liquid is extremely easy. Just mix each material into clear water, store it in a glass bottle, and plug the bottle mouth with a cork. In case of fire, either throw the bottle into the fire to break it, or remove the cork and sprinkle the liquid into the fire. The fire will be extinguished immediately upon contact with water, truly a wonderful product for fire extinguishing. It is advisable to store multiple bottles at home for convenience.</p>
<h3>Fireproof Clothing</h3>
<p>We know that clothing only has the function of sheltering from rain and not from fire. Normally, wearing a raincoat can protect against the intrusion of rainwater. However, no matter what garment, when it encounters flames, it will immediately burn. Now, there is a method to manufacture a fireproof material from ordinary clothing material. Make it into clothing and wear it. Even when entering and exiting a raging fire, there is no danger of being burned. This method has been tested several times in our experimental room and has achieved considerable results. Therefore, I dare not keep it secret and introduce it to the readers.</p>
<p>Raw Materials: Ordinary clothing material, Sodium Stannate (Sodium Stannate) at a concentration of about 3 pounds dissolved in 1 gallon of water, Ammonium Sulfate (Ammonium Sulfate) at a concentration of about 1.5 pounds dissolved in 1 gallon of water</p>
<p>Manufacturing Method: Immerse the ordinary clothing material in the Sodium Stannate solution, soak it thoroughly, and then dry it in the shade, not in direct sunlight. Then, immerse it in the Ammonium Sulfate solution, soak it thoroughly, and then dry it in the shade. Then, wash the clothing material in water several times, and then dry it. The fireproof clothing made by this method will retain its fireproof effect even after twenty washes.</p>
<p>On the Theme of Amusement</p>
<h3>All Are Assumptions</h3>
<p>— Wenbing</p>
<p>It is said that recently a newspaper has started a "Hypothetical" special publication, which shows that it is indeed a very clever title. In this day and age, whether it is an individual or a society, whether it is a country or the world, it is like a ship in the sea, encountering unfavorable winds and not going smoothly; it is because the tide of economic panic has swept from the West to the East, and from the East into our inland rivers. Therefore, society is in motion, people are screaming wildly, everywhere indicating the defects of this world, the pain of life. But, if we "assume" the facts a bit, then it would be good. What I am saying here may be quite reasonable, or it may be all nonsense, but "amusement" I think it can still be talked about, so I use "amusement" as the title.</p>
<p>Assuming that the Chinese people transformed the concept of family into national consciousness, I think the Chinese nation would definitely not be so disunited, with everyone throwing national honor and disgrace behind their heads.</p>
<p>Assuming that the Chinese people reversed bad habits and eliminated them completely, and also deliberately learned the strengths of foreigners, I think we would definitely not be looked down upon by foreigners so often... "Chinese people are Chinese after all!"</p>
<p>Assuming that a person could put aside "material desires" and not be obsessed with fame and fortune, I think he would definitely be broad-minded and happy, without worries.</p>
<p>Assuming that women did not act so coy and coquettish, showing that they are also individuals in society, I think men would definitely not dare to trample on them at will, or regard them as playthings.</p>
<p>Assuming that my life had a little security, I would definitely not rely on selling articles.</p>
<p>Assuming that imperialism did not so wantonly invade our country, I think our nation-state would definitely not be so shaken, so chaotic.</p>
<p>Assuming that our country had strived for self-improvement and had properly followed the legal system for the past twenty-one years, instead of engaging in fratricidal strife, I think foreign insults would definitely not come so frequently.</p>
<p>Assuming that Zhang Xueliang had resisted with all his might, and the central government had not solely relied on the League of Nations, I think the Northeast would definitely not have been lost in the past, and it would not have been allowed to continue to be lost.</p>
<p>Assuming that all the troops in the country were as brave as the 19th Route Army, I think the January 28th Shanghai Incident would not have resulted in our army's retreat, and the attitude of the League of Nations would definitely have fundamentally changed.</p>
<p>Assuming that the warlords did not collect taxes so oppressively, I think the common people would also be relatively stable, and bandits would not arise so turbulently.</p>
<p>Assuming that the economic structure of capitalism did not have contradictions, and "production" could match "consumption," and there was no waste of materials in society, I think the world would definitely not have such an economic panic.</p>
<p>Assuming that human resources were not so capitalized, that wealth was evenly distributed, and that everyone had food to eat, I think the number of criminal events in society would definitely not occur so much.</p>
<p>Assuming that imperialism had a little self-awareness and did not ruthlessly plunder weak nations, I think the human world could also reduce some disturbances—the voices of weak nations, self-determination, and resistance.</p>
<p>Assuming that the League of Nations was not a spoils-sharing organization and handled international issues impartially, I think the Japanese devils' forceful seizure of our Northeast would also be quickly addressed with effective sanctions.</p>
<p>There is simply no end to what can be said on this topic. Because of the precious space in this publication, I have to use force to "drag it on."</p>
<h3>The Ending of a Widow</h3>
<p>— Yunzong</p>
<p>Ever since the root-producer’s mother’s husband fell from the third floor while working in Shanghai that year and died, only her five-year-old son Rongxiang was her sole companion. She farmed two or three mu of rented land, worked diligently and saved money, and the mother and son could barely make ends meet.</p>
<p>But there was one thing that made her sad: whenever she woke up in the middle of the night, she always felt alone, with a cold pillow and blanket, feeling the bitterness of loneliness: especially when she encountered joyous weddings, which stirred her feelings and made her unable to sleep for several nights, "Tears before the pillow mingle with the rain before the steps, dripping to the dawn across the window."</p>
<p>Sometimes she even thought of marrying a handsome young man to enjoy the happiness of youth, but when she thought of her son becoming a "burden," causing the Zhang family's incense to be cut off, and her son being unable to hold his head up in the future, she dismissed the idea of remarriage.</p>
<p>One summer, there was a welcoming god temple fair at the Niangniang Temple. Beforehand, she specially bought a piece of patterned foreign cloth and asked Li Jinsheng, a tailor three or four li away, to make a short shirt and pants. Jinsheng was a handsome young man with a swept-back hairstyle, a full face, red lips and white teeth. When the root-producer’s mother saw him, she became close to him without realizing it.</p>
<p>One evening, it was pouring rain, and it kept falling, with a strong wind blowing. The umbrella couldn't hold up. Jinsheng ate dinner at her house and couldn't go home. With her permission, he stayed at her house. Ah, a match made in heaven!</p>
<p>Later, she felt her stomach gradually getting bigger. She thought that an illegitimate child could never be kept, and she was extremely terrified by the shame of being found out. She desperately sought a wonderful method of abortion and bravely tried it. Who knew that she would lose too much blood and die, abandoning her beloved son. Alas!</p>
<h3>Jottings at the Upper Story</h3>
<p>— Pengnian</p>
<p>(1) Don't Mind the Dead</p>
<p>In the ranks of the lower classes, it is very easy to hear the sentence "Don't mind the dead." Looking at the bottom line, the meaning is very full. Aren't the warlords of China now practicing the creed of "Don't mind the dead"? Zhang Xueliang's non-resistance policy, Han Fuqu and Liu Xiang of Shandong starting internal strife during the serious national crisis, the dispute between uncles and nephews in Sichuan, aren't these examples of not caring about the life and death of the people?</p>
<p>(2) Bargain Tricks</p>
<p>Shanghai can really have bargains, as long as you are willing to put up the sign of "Bargain": even if the price is the same, but the goods are inferior, the general public will still think it is an opportunity that cannot be missed. Yesterday, I saw a newspaper ad with prices that I envied. I wanted to go buy some goods. Stepping into the store, I saw that the prices were as before, with no bargains at all. But the buyers were snatching and grabbing, fighting to be first. This really baffled me. At the same time, I admired their bargain tricks.</p>
<p>(3) Humanitarianism</p>
<p>Yesterday, on the Fourth Road, I met a humanitarian. I asked him what he called humanitarianism. He said: "People who don't ride rickshaws are humanitarians." I thought that was right, but I saw a brand new car waiting for him next to him. So I asked him again: "Can humanitarianism ride in a car?" He said: "Why can't I? Because cars don't use human power." I had nothing to say to him in response. Later, I thought, the car class is humanitarianism.</p>
<p>(4) Advertising Magic</p>
<p>The books published by ×× Bookstore have always been given the cold shoulder by the world and have not sold well. Recently, they published an eye-catching advertisement, and it immediately took effect. The place that was once as cold as an empty room is now as busy as a marketplace. The manager, with a smiling face, kept apologizing to customers. From the mouths of the employees, one could only hear "×× books will be reprinted soon." And the customers! They were fighting to get them, with a sense of fear of falling behind. The magic of advertising is truly great.</p>

<p>Chick</p>
<p>— Yiping</p>
<h3>The Secrets of Shanghai (2)</h3>
<p>The climate has turned to winter. Looking at the old cotton robe on my body, I thought of my wandering life for the past three years. This year, since falling seriously ill in the autumn, life has become even more difficult. I am grateful to my old friend Xu Jun for his kindness. Last night, he intentionally or unintentionally tricked me into going to a dance hall. He thought that in this warm atmosphere, it might make me forget the pain of recent days, but the image it gave me was too bad!</p>
<p>Neither of us know how to dance. Usually, in conversations, we have regretted not having entered a dance hall. Last night, we came for the first time. In the contemptuous eyes of the Boys, it was obvious that we were newcomers from the countryside. Drinking coffee that cost eighty cents a cup, I felt it was not worth it. Xu Jun is not wealthy either. Why did we have to step into this heaven-like hell! Apart from enticing people with lust, it is far less poetic than we imagined. Dancing in China has become a tool for buying and selling sex. So the curtain of secrets is unveiled here. Readers, I will tell you a comedy of tragedy:</p>
<p>Not far from us, a noble lady was there before us. Like us, she did not dance. Drinking a glass of green liquid, her charming eyes constantly broadcast to each table from her slender eyelashes. The Boys were very attentive to her. Later, I realized that she was paying attention to us. I greeted Xu Jun to leave. At this moment, the Boy changed his smiling face and came over to whisper to Xu Jun. After speaking, he gestured with his mouth towards the noble lady. Subconsciously, I looked over, and the lady just raised her glass to her lips and nodded to us with a slight smile.</p>
<p>The electric lights changed to green, and the pulsating music and footsteps revolved towards the center. Xu Jun pulled my hand and sneaked out, but the lady misunderstood the meaning and was closely following us behind. Stepping down the stone steps, she rushed forward a few steps, opened the door of a car that was parked, and said very politely: "Please get in."</p>
<p>We were at a loss for what to do and fled forward. It seemed that the words "chick" were sent over after the car door slammed shut.</p>
<p>After walking two blocks, our pace slowed down. I looked at the old cotton robe on my body and said with a bitter smile: "The price of entering a dance hall!"</p>
<p>"Chick"! Xu Jun savored the words.</p>
<h3>Stone House Jottings</h3>
<p>— Kang Shi</p>
<p>There are many people in the world who consider women to be sources of trouble, yet they insist on approaching women, even bowing down at their pomegranate skirts, practically inviting disaster.</p>
<p>Living in modern society, one finds the richest life philosophy. As long as you carefully examine every matter, you will gain everything – a philosophy of life.</p>
<p>When a woman is unhappy, she always says the word "death." You can observe in many families that during arguments, the word "death" can always be heard from the woman's mouth.</p>
<p>As long as alimony is not abolished, we know that women are still dependent on men, which hinders the hope of raising women's status and improving their professional opportunities from progressing as much as possible.</p>
<p>In modern society, many people are deeply saddened by the death of a son; conversely, they do not grieve much when their parents die. Alas! I truly do not understand. This is probably a recurring performance!</p>
<p>Winter has arrived, and all kinds of tonics are once again essential items for the great officials. Here, we can understand them, because due to their physical weakness, they must take strong tonics in winter. This is a testament to the common saying, "The rich are often licentious."</p>
<p>The failure of a matter often begins with trivial things, or is caused in a moment, leading to one mistake after another. Therefore, one must be cautious at all times in life.</p>
<p>Although the love between men and women may last for a long time and be very deep, it can be damaged by small disagreements or misunderstandings in an instant, especially for men and women in free love. Such things can be seen in the newspapers every day.</p>
<p>A person's arrogance is created by their status and cultivated by the flattery of subordinates. The mutual encouragement of both sides creates this environment, from which no one can escape.</p>

<p>Introduction to Domestic Films</p>
<h3>National Crisis</h3>
<p>— Yan Nan</p>
<p>I remember that one day, a reader suggested, "I hope to see a film about the Volunteer Army resisting Japan." Now, I have finally found one.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, it will surely surprise everyone. This film is not produced by any company; it is "National Crisis," produced by the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang government in Nanjing. This is the first time that the party-state authorities have used film as a tool for social education!</p>
<p>This film does not contain any plot; it is merely a factual newsreel of the war. All the anti-Japanese soldiers are actors in the film; the invading Japanese army, from generals to privates, are all villainous characters in the film.</p>
<p>In the chaotic and tragic battlefields, sound is somewhat impossible. However, even without sound, the lively battle is enough to let us deeply recognize the soul of the nation: we will feel great oppression and stimulation!</p>
<p>The content includes: the September 18th night attack in Shenyang; the capture of Jinzhou on New Year's Day of the 21st year of the Republic; refugees entering the customs; the Volunteer Army's bloody battle in Zhasui; the January 28th burning of Zhabei; the 19th Route Army's bitter fight for ten weeks; and the bombing of Shirakawa in Hongkou. It is entirely real footage taken at the time and place. It is not only an educational film for residents in prosperous cities but also a good reference material for the international community to understand the truth of all the wars.</p>
<p>This huge and precious film owes much to foreigners. Many segments were filmed by neutral Americans at the time and place and were purchased and edited by the central authorities. (The Shanghai war was filmed by a special commissioner dispatched by the central government).</p>
<p>However, the concession authorities have always rejected films that promote our nation; therefore, this film cannot be screened in any cinema in the concession. As a last resort, it can only be shown at the Fuan Grand Theatre outside the sphere of influence of the concession. Moreover, the Central Propaganda Department has set low ticket prices in order to reach the general public. Of course, it is not intended for business speculation.</p>
<p>We have seen at least ten films about the Shanghai war, but this is the first time we have seen one about the Northeast. As a responsible citizen, I urge everyone to take some time to see this unprecedented "National Crisis"!</p>
<h3>A Scene from "The Pomegranate Flower Caper"</h3>
<p>In the middle is the female lead, long-faced Edna May Oliver; on the left is Rochelle Hudson, and on the right is Helen Chandler. I think the supporting roles are more attractive, but Oliver is very qualified.</p>
<p>Film Reviews</p>
<h3>Roque's "Movie Fan"</h3>
<p>— Ji Bing</p>
<p>Coming out from a movie group at Xinya on Sichuan Road, I stepped into the Guanglu gate to see "Movie Fan," which "over a thousand American film magazines praised in unison" (as the advertisement told me).</p>
<p>I admit that seeing Roque's movies is merely for a bit of superficial laughter. You watch him create various humorous situations on the screen and can't help but laugh along with everyone. But when the lights in the theater come on, you will never revisit the jokes. You laugh without thinking, and you forget without regret.</p>
<p>The plot is roughly as follows: A young man named Harold, who is obsessed with movie stars, applies to a film company in Hollywood. On the set, he falls in love with a female star named Marie. The audition doesn't go well, but when Marie and her male lead are shooting a scene where the male lead is about to shoot, Harold mistakenly believes it is real and fights with him. The film company manager sees that Harold's performance is excellent and signs a contract with him, fulfilling his desire to become a star.</p>
<p>The story is very simple, but with many interesting insertions, it unfolds very lively. The whole play is full of laughs, and they are used quite appropriately. The director must have put a lot of effort into this. As we know, the difficulty in shooting a slapstick comedy lies not in collecting jokes but in using them. The water battle is the key to the whole play. Roque also worked especially hard in these scenes. However, the most hilarious scenes are when he mistakenly wears a magician's costume, and eggs roll out of his sleeves, a white dove flies out of his chest, and many small mice are released from his pockets, turning the dance floor upside down. The female lead, Constance Bennett, is well-dressed. Her plain clothes and Spanish costumes make her look like two completely different people. Her performance is also not bad, but she is slightly weak during the water battle. However, she is not very important in these scenes.</p>
<p>The director is very clever. The opening scene uses a meat slicer as a camera, scallions as flowers, a pipe as a pistol, and a refrigerator as a C;pset (small room), which shows great imagination. A young man's "star obsession" is also vividly portrayed. The photography is also good, but the dialogue is too weak.</p>
<p>If you go to "buy a laugh," you will not be disappointed. If your purpose is not just that, then save your dollar, because to put it a bit strictly, besides a few set backgrounds of shooting, the rest of "Movie Fan" is all nonsense. There is not a single thing in it that could possibly happen in real life.</p>

<h3>Thus I Explain</h3>
<p>— Hua Zhi</p>
<p>丨Answering "An Interesting Question"丨Regarding the term "star," Curator Qiaqia raised "An Interesting Question" in this journal. Now, I will try to answer it with my shallow understanding:</p>
<p>I think the word "star" does not only refer to famous actors in the film industry, but also generally refers to the giants of the entire art world, so it is still an interesting issue in the art world. Then, why do we call them "stars" instead of "bright moons"? The reasons are nothing more than the following:</p>
<p>(1) From a practical perspective, first of all, there are many stars, but only one bright moon. Therefore, it is more appropriate to describe famous actors as "stars." Secondly, stars seem to have a flickering light, unlike the bright moon, which is flat and lifeless. It is very fitting to use this to describe actors appearing on the screen. In addition, the moon has phases of waxing and waning, while stars are always present, which can subtly imply the nightly appearances of actors.</p>
<p>(2) From a symbolic perspective, there are also many reasons to be stated: first, the word "star" implies the meaning and connotation of the food of art. The modern famous symbolist poet, Allan Poe, said that the object of the artistic fairy fruit that the human spirit craves, in addition to the spiral of flowers, the dense thickets, the waves of wheat fields, the felling of eastern tall trees, the green scenery of hillsides, the dispersal of white clouds, the faint shimmering of small rivers, and the reflection of the Milky Way, the first and last food is the twinkling starlight in the sky and the reflection of stars in the depths of the well. This completely reveals the mysteriousness of stars. Second, the etymology of the word "star" symbolizes fate. Western "Star" and Chinese stars have auspicious and ominous stars, so this word is enough to symbolize the fate of actors rising and falling. Third, in the night shadow, in the darkness, groups of stars fly around wildly,</p>
