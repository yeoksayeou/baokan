<p>時評</p>
<h3>讀中國銀行二十年度報告（一）彬</h3>
<p>中國銀行向出有中行月刋一種。於我國内之經濟情勢與世界經濟之變動。月有報告。其數目字之統計與材料之搜羅不失爲研究經濟學之重要資料。最近復出刋二十年度報告。調查分析。頗爲周詳。至足博取社會之好譽。　　去年（一九三一）爲最足重視之一年。世界經濟凋敝之趨勢於去年愈以顯其深重。而在我國則内以洪水之泛濫。外以日本之侵凌在經濟界亦顯呈空前之突變。故一九三一年爲値得大書特書之一年。而中國銀行二十年度之報告。亦至少足以代表我金融界之意見。故亦有足以令吾人重視之價値。該報告大槪分爲三部。首爲中國銀行二十年度之營業報告。次爲二十年度國内外經濟政治變動之陳述。末爲對於如何求世界繁營復興貢獻其意見其統計與材料皆相當翔實。報告亦眉目淸明。獨是吾人於其觀察與其分析。及其對於挽救凋敝世界所貢獻之意見。則未敢苟同爰陳所見藉供探討報告中之第一部爲該行之營業報告。吾人茲不必提出若何之討論但檢查其存欵性質。則以十九年度爲例二十年度存欵户數與團體個人存欵之增加。爲顯然之事實。同時。其第二部中有二十年度上海地價又繼續增高全年成交數目達一萬三千萬兩之報告。於此可證去年底吾人在「一年來之經濟」一文中之都市澎脹與金融家特别致力於投機營業之分析尙無若何之錯誤。就都市之澎脹。即可反證農村之凋敝。就金融家之致力投機。即可反證我國實業之衰落。我國經濟界之畸形狀態。於此即顯示其一般。第二部爲陳述二十年度國内外經濟政治之變動。雖搜羅事實。極爲豐富。但其對於現實之體認與把握。及對於致此結果之根因之分析。則有如上文所言。吾人絶未敢苟同。</p>
<p>吾人認爲欲體認并分析一九三一年世界與中國經濟政治變動之現象。絶不能忽視資本主義經濟刻已步入第三期之一大前提。誠如該報告中所言。「在國外則市面銷沉。達於極點。生產過剩。失業激增。金融恐慌。岌岌有不可終日之勢。各國政府雖忙於救濟。而卒如大火燃燒。愈救愈烈。」然而何以致此。則自有其故。</p>
<p>資本主義進入第三期。其恐慌之所以異於戰後者。即戰後之恐慌。爲由於大戰時期鉅大之破壞。百業停頓。資本與生產。都感供不應求。而目前之恐慌。則由於澎脹過剩。益以生產之厲行合理化。更使都市日益澎脹。農村日益凋敝。產品堆積日多。資本與人之失業亦日益增鉅。貿易激减。於是而金融界之恐慌狂潮。遂一發而不可收拾。愈救而愈烈。此一理論上之綫索。吾人必先把握牢固。而後可以體認現實。把握現寳。否則吾人亦惟有戰慄於此恐慌狂潮之前。如開尼斯喟然發出「我們今日陷入無救的迷圍中。因爲我們在處理一架靈活的機器（資本主義的經濟機器）時。着着是迷誤了。這架機器的規律我們一點也不了解」之浩嘆耳</p>

<h3>中國銀行二十年度營業報告</h3>
<p>政治安定社會繁昌爲事　基</p>
<p>中國銀行成立今届第二十年、不特進步之　度、不能　　美銀行相　頏、抑且往往有進五步而退十步之感覺、甚至有欲進且止之困苦、廻憶中國銀行二十年　之歷史、在辦事人方面、雖時時兢兢　　　盡　戰、而每年所　報告之成績、實不敢謂堪副股　與社會之期望、同人等慚疚之餘、不能不有一言爲我股東及社會告者、銀行在國家社會中所占之地位、無異工廠中凡百機械之一　、　機械之　置、必須地盤堅　、方可　轉如意、銀行盛　或數雖繫乎辦事人之才能與信用、而其最重要之基礎、實在政治之安定、與社會之繁昌、今日以往、論政治則連年内戰、四分五　、輪社會則災害頻仍、匪亂遍地、政治無一年之安定、社會　頻於破產、而謂銀行能獨自滋長發榮、何異裝置機械於泥沙之上冀其行　不息安可得乎、民國二十年上半年、雖有寗粤分裂之爭、幸贛鄂剿匪尙能得手、北方各省年歲中熱、方謂下半年或可苟安、不意六月間長江各省水災大發、蔓延十餘省、九月間東北事變發生、抗日運動波及全國、此二者於社會經濟發生重大之影響、百業停滯商號倒閉、銀根奇緊、證券狂落、於是本行一年來所致力於發展國内外貿易輔助農工業之種種計劃、即受頓挫、且須頓平日所蓄積之實力、以資挹注、故此一年中、本行之工作、雖對於社會服務不無一二足述、然於營年獲利之成績、實無以告慰股東、要之内憂外患之來、由於政治不良所致、一般社會、同受政治不良之影響、吾中國銀行、亦豈能倖免哉、</p>
<p>民國二十年貸借對照表損</p>
<h3>益計算表改訂之說明</h3>
<p>貸借對照表之簡明與國際化</p>
<p>本行歷來貸借對照表之編製、未免　於傳統之　式、其科目次序、均嫌含混槪括、查貸借對照表之作用、在以一時間百千累萬之營業出入、用極簡單之形式、報告於股東、而同時能以極明瞭之内容、公開於社會、且得與其他國外銀行者相互比對以促成國際化之會計制度、故其科目之訂定、次序之排列、不特　使股東及顧客一覽而即明瞭、一行資產負債及損益之實况、更應使讀者持與其他國際銀行之科目程序、排比同觀、有易於參證比較之便利、庶幾銀行内容之虚實、辦事人員才能之長短、可盡量受股東與顧客之公判、而收競進之功、損益計算表、所以顯示營業之成籟、務使明瞭易曉、故亦略爲改訂、茲將本年度貸　對照表及損益計算表改訂之點、分别略述於左、</p>
<p>甲貸借對照表</p>
<p>（一）「未收股本」從前係列入　產類科目、今則依照普通習愼在負債類增改「已收股本」科目塡已收資本實數、</p>
<p>（二）「同業存欵」「同業放欵」以前歸入「活期存欵」「活期放欵」項下、惟因其性質　於活動故另列「同業存欵」「同業放欵」科目、使與其他存欵放欵、有所區别、</p>
<p>（三）貼現及買進期票、與其他放欵性質不同、應另立科目、</p>
<p>（四）期收期付、原非存欵放欵、而向來歸入「活期存欵」、「活期放欵」項下、未收及代收向來亦歸人存欵放欵項下、均不盡合理、今則增加「期收契約」「期付契約」「未收欵項」「代收欵項」等對方科目、分列資負兩方、</p>
<p>（五）「保證」及「保付」乃代表顧客之負債及銀行之擔保、今新添科目以期明瞭、</p>
<p>（六）　產負僓雙方各科目排列之次序、係參照國際慣例而定、在資產方面以各類資產變現之難易爲先後、易於雙現者置於先、在負債方面除資本公積金及盈餘滾存依照向例在先外、其他各類負債依其性質之活動與固定、而分先後活動者置於先、庶幾雙方對照易於判别、</p>
<p>已損益計算表</p>
<p>（一）「兌換損益」與「利息」合併、係依照歐洲各國通例、</p>
<p>（二）原有「雜損益」科目之内容、係包含手續費等項、故今改爲「手續費及其他」並依照各國慣例、將「有價證券損益」科目合併於此項科目之内、</p>
<p>（三）滙欵爲本行重要業務之一故特立「匯水」科目、</p>
<p>（四）本行發行數目較大、每年攤銷兌換券製造費爲數不小、故另立科目、</p>
<p>（五）原「有各項攞提」科目内之兌換券製造費一部份、旣已劃出另立科目、故將其餘營業用房產器具折舊一部份、亦另立科目、以符名實、並將原有「各項攤提」科目廢止之、</p>
<h3>中國銀行民國二十年度之營業</h3>
<p>存欵增加一萬六千餘户</p>
<p>放欵趨重工商業</p>
<p>有價證券核實給價</p>
<p>执劫國貨工業</p>
<p>努力華僑服務</p>
<p>便利國内滙兌</p>
<p>民國二十年上半年各地營業狀况、均見進步、良由時局暫時安定、市面資　活動、敵業務隨之增加、而本行自十九年來之　種革斬、已漸見社會良好之　響、若無下半年之長江水災東省事　、則民國二十年度之營業、　有　飛之進步、　雖有下半年之疾　　兩、而本行仍能屹　自立不受風濤之　　、此又本行二十年來、　抱之　　主　、所產生之信用及蓄　之實力、得以收效於盤根　節之日堪爲股東告者、茲縷述如左、</p>

<p>丙服務僑胞之關切、華僑欵爲構成中國經濟平衡之一要素、而一思僑胞之速涉重洋艱苦奮鬥以助祖國、爲銀行者宜如何爲僑胞謀滙兌手續之便利如何爲僑胞謀存放投資之安全如何使僑胞知有祖國之金融機關爲彼等關心服務、實爲吾中國銀行應盡之天職是以在美國荷屬南洋及新加坡均增添代理機關委託代收華僑滙欵、滙票上刋明中國銀行兌付、在香港廣州汕頭厦門上海等行指定招待專員、務使收欵便利、滙費減輕、凡遇回國僑胞有所詢問委託、均爲竭誠答復代辦、故辦理雖祗半載而成績已著、英國日本因本行已設有經理處、故橋胞益覺便利、唯望世界市面早日恢復、僑胞生計日見寬裕、俾本行爲僑胞服務之志願充量發揮、尤所深盼也、了調查工作之設計、自十七年改組爲國際滙兌銀行、與工商業之接觸尤密、商家信用及產業狀態之匯切認識、其需要日增、是以調查工作之設　、在國内雖未普遍注意、然實際上已成爲當先之急務、本年各國實業團來華視察、外國行家派遺代表來華諮詢、中外廠商委託調查出口行家、以及商品供求給應事項本行殷勤辦理、雖極繁忙、但此種工作、互助匪細、願中外商家繼續委託、中外貿易因而增進、而國際經濟由此媒介、更可日趨接近、</p>
<p>戊安定市面之援手、水災之後、證劵狂落、金融緊縮、東北事變發生、金融輪廓、局部斷折、復以外患迫于眉睫、人人藏現戒備、銀錢行號之力弱不勝者、紛紛擱淺受擠、銀拆洋厘愈抬愈高、羣疑金融風潮之不可苟免、本行鑒于情勢嚴重、一面竭力緊縮放欵保持實力、一面拆放同業緩和市面、幸終歲未見市面發生破綻、堪以爲幸耳、</p>

<p>二十年度本行各項營業稍見進步、原期各項準備不特可以益加充實、即盈餘亦可增加、奈以下半年市况、急轉直下、致辦事人之期望、適得其反、良用遺憾、所幸一切資產、均能核實結價、並能保持股東應得之官利而業務成績、亦能利溥于社會、此堪告慰于股東、當亦爲股東所爲樂聞者也、</p>
<h3>二十年度國内外經濟政治變</h3>
<p>動與國民經濟之損益</p>
<p>中國受國外影響損失三萬萬元</p>
<p>受國内影響損失十萬萬元</p>
<p>二十年度國内外事變之、影響之鉅可稱空前、在國外則市面銷沉、達于極點、生產過剩、失業激增、金融恐慌、岌岌有不可終日之勢、各國政府、雖忙於救濟、而卒如大火延燒、愈救僡烈、以致國與國之間以及人民與金融機關彼此之信用、根本動搖、提存取現、不可遏止、終至德國賠欵宣告停付、私債訂約展緩、英國成立混合内閣政府、嚴减預算、停止現金本位、在國内則五月間水災發生、被災區域達一百五十賖萬方里、匪患蔓延、不可戢止、九月十八日日軍侵奪東三省中國統治之政權、富源甲于全國之遼黑吉熱四省、陷於動搖、結果全國憤起反日、每年進出日最鉅之日本對華貿易、　然劇跌、凡此種直接　接影響於國民經濟、至重且鉅、而於國民富力之增損、更有重大之出入、茲再分别言之、</p>
<p>甲·世界經濟恐慌之現象、民國二十年度、全世界經濟狀况、承去年褻敗之後、不獨毫無轉機、抑且更趨惡化、一·失業人數　增、其在英德各國固不必言、即美國亦增至一千萬人、法國亦增至五萬四千人、二·物價跌落、英國之物價指數、由一九○三年百分之七七·八、跌落至百分之六四·九、「一九二七年爲一○○」美國由一九三○年百分之八七·一、跌落至百分之七一六、「一九二六年爲一○○」三·銀行　潮、波及全球、德國五大銀行中之二Ｄ字銀行先後有暫停付欵、及合併之舉動、法國有一重要銀行亦幾致停業、美國停閉銀行共有二千三百四十二家之多、存欵總額共計美金廿萬○○八百七十二萬九千元、四·農產過剩、美國棉花過剩約一千四五百萬包、小麥過剩三萬一千五百萬英斛、加拿大小麥一萬六千九百萬英斛、澳洲小麥過剩九千五百萬莫斛、　根庭小　　剩約一萬三千○○萬英斛、日本生絲剩十五萬六千包、</p>
<p>·出口之减少、以中　　銀之　、銀價跌落、物價降低宜可增加出口、乃以世界市　不　、需嬰减少、中國不能享得縣毫利益、去年出口、不特不免增加、　减少百分之零八、計减七百萬海　兩、</p>
<p>因·進口之增加銀價跌落、宜可抑止進口、乃以世界生產遏剩、物價之落、趨於　價、如棉花、小麥、米、烟葉、等等、進口價格甚至低於土產之價、於是廠家相率　進洋貨、故民國二十年以上四種　產品之進口、價値合計約三萬七千二百六十八萬　兩、較十九年多六千三百餘萬海關兩、約合九千四百五十餘萬元、其　至少四分之三、爲受世界物價之影響而增加者約　七千萬元、</p>
<p>丁·華僑匯欵之减少、華僑　欵、爲中國無形出口貿易之大宗、藉以彌補每年鉅額入超、其匯額之增减影響於全國之貸借甚大、乃自世界市面　敗、南洋各地、商業綢廠、失業衆多、於是英荷兩國政府設法限止華僑入口、又如新加坡第一次訂律限止華僑入口時、入口人數比照以前减少百分之三十、後又修改時、又减少百分之十五、荷　各島對於華僑進口人頭稅、每人本定徵收三十荷幣、嗣加至一百五十荷幣、以致華僑移至南洋者、日見减少、而回　者、　見加多、去年華僑匯入之欵、雖不能得正確數字、大約匯至香港約國幣四千萬元、廣州内地約二千萬元、汕頭約三千八百萬元、厦門五千二百萬元、上海及其他各地約三四千萬元、綜計約一萬八九千萬元、不逾二萬萬元之數、較之民國十九年至少減去五千萬元、</p>
<p>戊·金貲投資之虧損、中國金融機關、及有資產者、近年以來、因銀價漲落過鉅、於投資　乎安定之性質、不見合宜、故頗多購存外幣、及投資外幣公債、冘以英幣爲多、自英幣停止付現、價格跌落約百分之三十、中國方面之金幣投資以一千萬鎊計、雖不久可望恢復、照目前匯兌及債劵行市估計之亦有二三千萬兩之損失、此外華僑在國外之財產、若以銀幣計之、則更有鉅量之損失、</p>
<p>以上均屬於國外經濟之變動、而眅響及於中國者、其屬於國内者、不外水災匪患與東省事變三大端、</p>
<p>甲、水災之損害、去年水災之鉅、爲六十年乘所未見、區域遍二十餘省、災民達數千萬、其最烈者爲江浙湘鄂釐皖汴魯省、本行所調查之災情如左、</p>
<p>省别、被災田畝被災農户損失金額畝户元</p>
<p>湖北二七、五二三、０００、二、一二五、０００、一００、０００、０００安徽一三、九五０、０００二、一五五、０００四０、０００、０００江蘇六一、四三一、０００三、六二七、０００一００、０００、０００湖南一三、九五０、０００一、一００、０００一００、０００、０００河南三四、六九五、０００一、五八六、０００六０、０００、０００江西一四、二四八、０００一、０三五、０００一０、０００、０００山東三０、一三五、０００一、五五一、０００一０、０００、０００浙江一五、七三六、０００九三二、０００三０、０００、０００共計三一一、六六八、０００一四、０九一、０００四五０、０００、０００據國府統計局之調查、謂受災八省被淹田畝、共二萬五千五萬萬畝、損失產米額九萬萬斤、佔全國產額百分之二十四、小米高梁十四萬萬斤、佔全國產額百分之二十九、米以每斤四分計、棉花以每斤四錢計、小米高梁每斤以三分計、共須損失四萬五千七百萬元、其數目與本行調查不相下下、此僅爲有形之損失、益以身體健康、與社會道德之退化、其形之損失、又烏可以數量計、影響於吾民族前途之榮枯、何等重大、</p>
<p>乙·東北事變之損害、九月十八日東北事變發生以後、遼吉熱四省、均入戰事狀態、各業停滯、人民流離遷徙、内地糧產、無法運出、商號相繼倒閉、東北居民、直接間接所受之損失、不可勝計、而各省輸入東省之貨、因以　足不前、東省商號所欠内地各埠帳欵、不能如期償還、於津滬兩地金融、損害尤大、次則各地相繼封存日貨、此項日貨、或已在華商之手、或已押在各地錢莊、雖不能得一確實數目、大致不在一萬萬元以下、此一萬萬元資金之呆擱、亦受東北事變之所賜、茲再益以因事變而發生政治之糾紛、人心之恐慌、金融之緊縮、商務之衰敗、其有形無形之損害、更不可限量、</p>
<p>丙·匪患之損害、江西一省匪擾多年、民國二十年更由湖南躉延及於湖北、現不特贛省三分之二、成匪區、湖北十餘縣、亦受波及、此二千萬人民之損失、與夫生產之减少、及年耗五六千萬之剿匪經費、其數又總括在二萬萬以上、</p>
<p>綜各種損害以製中華民國之决算其數目之可驚足以震駭世界惟發生損害之由基於國内政治之變動者遠超出國外經濟之變動此則最可悲痛耳</p>
<h3>民國廿年度之國際貿易</h3>
<p>進口超過五萬萬兩</p>
<p>日本退居第二位</p>
<p>生銀進口减少貿易集中上海一埠</p>
<p>今後中國無購買力</p>
<p>一、進口超過五萬四千餘萬兩</p>
<p>民國二十年度世界不景氣之現象、較之十九年度、特不稍見和　、且益加甚、各國之對外貿易、無不减少、以二十年度與十九年度較、各國進出口貿易减少之百分率如左、</p>
<p>進口、出口</p>
<p>英國减一六、六减三一、九</p>
<p>日本减二○、○减二八、一</p>
<p>美國减三一、八减三六、九</p>
<p>德國减三五、三减一八、八</p>
<p>法國减一九、四减二九、○</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>國减三三、○减八、三</p>
<p>瑞士减一二、二减二三、五</p>
<p>加拿大减三七、七减三二、七</p>
<p>至於俄國、無工人央業及產業阻滯之現象、固不可與各國相提並論、但全世界不景氣炎影響、彼亦無可避免、考俄國五年計劃、一面使進出口之均衡、一面使出口數量之遞增、其前年以往之三年間、五榖及木材兩類之出口額、較諸昔日、增加至兩三倍之多、民國二十年即其五年中之第四年度、照原計劃、本年出口總數、應較第一年度、增加一倍、然而本年八個月間之出口總値、其數字已比上年减少百分之二十、同時入超且達二萬一千六百三十一萬盧布、即合英金二千一百萬磅矣、</p>
<p>返而考二十年度吾國之進出口貿易、則進口增百分之八、一、出口祇减少百分之○、八、純進口額爲一、四二七、五七四、○○○兩（海關兩下仿此）較之十九年度之一、三○九、七五五、○○○兩、增加一一七、八一九、○○○兩、純出口額爲八八七、四五○、０００兩、較十九年度之八九四、八四三、○○○兩、减少七、三九三、○○○兩、進出口貿易總額（金銀及貨幣不計在内）爲二、三一五、○二四、○○○兩、較之十九年度之二、二○四、五九九、○○○兩、總减少六九、○三○、○○○兩、</p>
<p>其中最可注意者、厥爲二十年度之進口超過出口竟較之十九年度增加百分之三○、價値達五萬四千餘萬兩、合洋達八萬一千餘萬兩之鉅、去年本行報告中因是年進口超過出口達四萬一千四百九十餘萬兩、認爲我國貿易史中所僅見不意今年竟扶搖直上、視此又增加一萬二千五百餘萬兩、查吾國自通商以來常處入超地位、自一八六八年至一九三一年前後六十三年間、僅有六年爲出超之年、自一八七七年以後、殆已不復再見出超、雖在歐戰期内、如民國八年前後、入超數目曾大見减少、迨戰後即又恢復、以民國元年至民國二十年間統計之、進口超過出口之總額共三十八萬一千五百餘萬兩、合洋五十七萬二千二百五十萬兩、而本年進口貨中、仍以農產品爲大宗、如棉花米麥麥粉烟草五宗、共値三萬八千四百餘萬兩、此類情形、於每年報告中、必大聲疾呼、有識者固不乏注意及此、而以國民經濟上有如是重大之病症、政府猶熟視無睹、毫無補救、故不能不三復斯言、</p>
<h3>二進口美居首位出口有日本居首位</h3>
<p>中國進口貿易中、各國所占之數量、向來日本居第一位、本年退居第二位、蓋自東北事變發生、全國各界、同聲憤激、各地商人之抵制日貨運動、雷厲風行、自九月以後、步步下降、十一月份之由日輸華貨價、僅及七月之三分之一、</p>

<p>中國國民嘗以數十年來、年年入超、未見困窮、視爲可聽其自然、在外國則早已或增加關稅、或限制匯兌、或限制消費、而吾國則除爲增加稅收而稍增稅率以外並水謀有所補救、但入超差額、　必有抵補、方得平衡、或恃無形之收入、或恃外資之輸入、至我國固有之無形收入專賴華僑滙欵、但以商業不振、本年匯欵、已見减少、倘一時市面不易恢復、銀價若再向上、則華僑匯欵當有减無增、又以中國政治不定、外國資本亦不見充裕、故投資於中國者亦不易加增、而内地秩序不寗、外國敎會之宣敎及旅客之遊行、更將减少是外資之輸入、亦不足恃、證以今年生銀輸入之大减、廿年度祗四千五百餘萬兩、較之十九年度不足一半、此即輸出少輸入多、無形收入减少、無抵品以易生銀之證明、中國國際貸借、如何平衡、雖經經濟學者之研求、尙未能得一正確數目、敢謂廿年度入超五萬四千餘萬兩、除以華僑欵抵補一萬四千餘萬兩、外國投資以及宣敎駐軍旅行等外資輸入、或占二萬萬兩外、此外二萬萬兩之差額、恐不外依賴進口洋行製造廠家及銀行之放帳信用、以爲挹注、設一切條件、不見改善、放帳信用、已達限度、則除减少進口以外、别無他道、國民當知、今日已逹此境界、若政府人民、不思减少洋貨之購用增加土貨之出口、或各友邦協力增購中國貨品、以易售其欲售之貨、恐今日以後、中國人民之購買力、必致一落千丈、而貿易之衰落、將至不可挽救矣、</p>
<h3>民國二十年度之農工業</h3>
<p>紗業不敵日本</p>
<p>國貨工業基礎不固</p>
<p>絲業不能與日本競爭</p>
<p>農產口進口二萬萬餘元</p>
<p>一工業</p>
<p>中國近年來國貨工業、已見萌芽、孳生甚速、主要者當首推紗業、而紗錠亦日有增加、但與世界之工業國相較、則尙百不得一、其尤可注意者、上海一隅、已成中國工業之中心、大小工廠約二千家、資本總額約三萬萬元、工人總計約二十五萬、本年因原料價低、成本減輕、復以抵制日貨關係、除絲業因日絲充斥、市價銳跌外、其餘各業上半年均見蓬勃氣象、較十九年度爲獲利、不意其後長江水災東北事變次第發生、銷路銳減、故全年總計不能有意外之盈餘、惟關於中國工業有一二不可忽視之點、略言之如下、</p>
<p>一、紗業之競爭中國人自辦之工業、首推紗業、而中日工業競爭最烈者、亦莫如紗業、去年本行調查、全國之中國紗廠所有錠子共爲二百三十三萬六千餘錠、在華日本紗廠錠子、約一百五十餘萬、然以日廠資本雄厚、技衛精良、組織完密、故雖如本年度抵制之激烈、工作時間之縮煜、而上海日廠之產量、反多於中國廠家、計上海華廠出紗五十六萬包、出布十四萬七千件、上海日廠出紗六十九萬七十包、出布二十一萬六　作　　中國全國計之、華　共出　一百四十五萬八千包、出布三十五萬七千件、日廠共出紗一百萬零零八千包、出布三十一萬五千件、由此觀之、中日相較、日廠之全體產量、出布幾相等、出紗則多於紗錠比例應得之產額、本年度華廠增加六萬餘錠、而日廠反增加十萬餘錠、</p>
<p>近來關稅增加、金價向上、進口細布價貴、紗廠本以出細紗爲獲利之源、華廠更應乘此時機、增加產量、乃上海華廠所有之細紗錠子、祗占總錠數之四成半、而日廠則占日錠總數之七成半、中國廠家、若欲改易細紗錠、又豈短時間所能舉辦、是以本年度雖有抵制之舉、而日貨之需要如故、加以日本紗成本、往往賣價低於國產、華北各省、但計價之高賤、不論貨之中外、故黄河以北、畿成日紗之銷售區域、長江下游以及華南各省、則倡用國貨、甚爲熱烈、日紗雖較難插足、而日本紗業在中國之占優勢、已成明顯之事實、中國廠家資本薄弱、組織散漫、技術不良、成本高貴、復以工潮迭見、而人民之自動抵制、未足深恃、則中國廠家之能否不爲日廠所壓倒、實可爲深憂、此則悉在中國實業界與人民之努力與否耳、</p>
<p>二、絲業之衰敗中國產絲之品質價格與數量、均不能與日絲競爭、論品質則繭種龐雜、機械陳舊、以致絲質高下不一、論數量則年雖產五萬餘包、而品質不齊、不美國大量生產之需要、論價、則繭價高昻、綶折奇大、拆息稅捐負担奇重、成本大於日絲十之二三、在普通年成已難與日絲競爭、乃本年歐美絲市、日益疲滯、絲價暴跌、前年年底廠絲尙在一千兩外、本年四五月間僅及九百餘兩、至年底降至八百兩、若以日絲價格合華絲價格祗等於六百兩左右、乃中國廠方成本均在千兩以外、虧耗太鉅、惟有觀望不售、結果各廠勢難支持、相率停閉、上海一百零七家絲廠、工作者僅二十餘家、無錫四十九家中工作均亦祗十餘家、其他蘇鎭杭嘉湖各廠十之八九者、已停閉、二十年度、江浙廠絲輪出數量較之十八年減五分之二、較十九年減五分之一、十八年輸出爲五萬四千　　、十　　　爲四萬二千　包本年度祗三萬二千餘包、廣東絲廠總數、減去百分之四十、出口總數僅四萬六千餘包、比十九年減去一萬四千餘包、比十八年減二萬包、</p>
<p>政府爲救濟起見、有絲業公債八百萬元之發行、然結果增加出口稅每包三十元、債券旣不能在市面流通、而於絲廠、復無所補救、而且增加出口之成本、可謂毫無計劃之救濟、</p>
<p>所可喜者、國人對於　種業漸知注意、此一年中江浙蠶種業之進步、蒸蒸日上、浙江蠶種產額增加一倍、江蘇在一倍以上、絲廠之中亦有數家改用多條繅絲、以提高均匀程度、期合美國之需要、然根本之道、仍在政府與人民切實合作於繭種之改良、絲廠機械全部之更換、必須有一大規模之統盤計劃、切實舉行、否則養蠶繅絲、勢將絶跡、即中國廠家所夢想之美國愛用華絲之機會、一旦實現、亦等於鏡花水月耳、</p>
<p>三、國貨工業基礎之薄弱三年以來、國貨工業、誠以關稅增加、價格跌落、人民漸知愛用國貨、大有振興氣象、二十年度各國貨工廠之營業數量、較之十九年度均有增加、茲將十九年度各種營業總値爲基數、將二十年度增加百分數列於左「十九年度爲一○○」</p>
<p>麫粉業一二○機器業一二五</p>
<p>染織業一二五洋傘業六○</p>
<p>油墨業三五○棉織業一二八</p>
<p>造紙業一二五絲織業一六○</p>
<p>橡膠業二○○針織業一○○</p>
<p>調味業一一二火柴業一二○</p>

<p>造漆業一二八化裝品業一二○</p>
<p>榨油業一○九毛織業八九</p>
<p>磚瓦業一四三</p>
<p>是以除一二業稍遜外、餘均進步、營業總値約增加四千萬元、若無水災與東北事變、則進步尙不止此、惟國貨工業、萌芽伊始、而一則資本均屬薄弱、二則原料大都來自國外、三則設備不完備之小廠增加、四則外國廠家之競爭、尤以日本在　　　　貨工　貨國貨工　　　　、　　　　市面衰敗銷路停滯、金價跌落、因此外貨充斥、國貨工業之基礎、隨時足以動搖、將來挽救之衛、固惟國民愛用國貨之自覺力是賴、而充實資本、改良技術、同業集中力量免除無謂競爭、工人團體明瞭增加生產、爲救國天職、誠意勞資合作、亦爲强固國貨工業基礎不可缺之要素也、</p>
<h3>二農業</h3>
<p>一米麥二十年春間多雨、夏季江河汎濫、農產大受損害、米產約减收二成三成之間、小麥約减收一成、二十年度洋米進口超過華米出口之數、計一○七十三萬六千擔、合銀六千○二十一萬四千兩「海關兩」小麥進口超過出口計二千二百十九萬八千擔、合銀八千一百七十餘萬兩、粉進口超過出口四百七十九萬餘担、合銀二千六百二十餘萬兩、以其總進口數與十九年度比較、則小麥增六倍以上、米減四成、麫粉減一成八、三項之進口總額、爲一萬八千六百四十餘萬兩、純進口額爲一萬六千八百十一萬四千餘兩、約占進口全體百分之十三、</p>
<p>查二十年度糧食進口總額中有小麥二百六十八萬担、麫粉四十三萬七千担、係爲國因賑濟中國水災賒借美麥美粉四十五萬噸之一部份、「訂自一九三四年起分三年償還」、此項數量可抵因災損失農產總量百分之九、然以内地運輸不便、耗費過鉅、展轉運卸、又多暗損、且價格係按超運日期結價、設運時麥價回漲、將來金價抬高、則我國虧累必甚、故向外國賒貸糧食以賑災、是否經濟、實屬疑問要之、平日水利廢弛、臨時補苴、復乏良策、謂非謀之不臧、豈可得乎、</p>
<p>二、棉花、據中華棉業統計會二十年十二月十五日統計報告、全國棉產額祗六百四十六萬担、較十九年度減少二百三十四萬担、同時紗廠紗錠增加、細紗原料、需用外棉、故二十年度輸入美印等棉四百五十八萬四千餘担、較之十九年度增加百分之三十一、合銀一萬六千五百九十八萬七千海關兩、土棉出口有一百十萬六千餘担、合銀三千零一萬餘兩、</p>
<p>三、茶葉、二十年度紅茶產額比十九年度減十分之一、綠茶減十分之三、產量減少、市價見漲、加以銀價低落、出口貨高、故茶商稍有沾潤、出口茶葉計七十萬零八千担、合銀三千三百零五萬九千兩、較之十九年度之二千六百二十八萬四千兩、增加約十分之三、</p>
<p>四、烟葉、烟葉已漸成主要農產之一、二十年度山東烟葉收成約五千五百萬磅、河南烟葉、品質不及山東、數量則過之、約六千萬磅、安徽門台子因雨水過多、數量品質、均不及十九年、收成約祗有一百五十餘萬磅、祗以美國烟草豐收、價格大賤、暢銷中國、故我國農民、未能售得善價、計自美國輸入中國烟草、共一百二十三萬五千担、較十九年增加三十餘萬担、合銀四千九百二</p>
<p>十六萬三千兩、</p>
<p>五、植物油、頭油花生油桐油爲吾國農產出口物</p>
<p>之主要商品、二十年度豆油出口約一百五十萬担、合銀一千六百餘萬兩、比十九年度約減十分之二、花生油出口約八十萬九千担、合銀一千二</p>
<p>百五十四萬餘兩、比十九年度約減十分之六、桐油出口八十萬九千担、合銀一千八百八十八萬兩、比十九年度約減十分之三、</p>
<p>中國以農業立國、而農產品進口如此之多、出口日見減少、豈因天時地利之不宜、人民勞力之不及、有以致此、實不外内戰匪患、人民無法耕種、運輸不便、苛捐雜稅、馴致此盈彼絀、盈考無法脫售、絀者反以購自國外爲廉、其原因又不得不歸咎于政治之不良耳、</p>
<h3>信用與現金之緊縮</h3>
<p>願國民一致排除一切不生產的信　　用之臌脹</p>
<p>節减不必要的消費</p>
<p>銀行對於生產事業之信用勿爲過　　度的緊縮</p>
<p>人民的積蓄勿爲不生產的藏儲</p>
<p>國際貸借差額之鉅、國民富力損害之廣、流動資產折耗之大、已如上述、而商業信用之基礎、不外資產與現金、金融商業市塲之信用貸借、雖數百萬萬、數千萬萬、而實際以現金結算者、祗占一小部分、十之八九以資產爲代表、是以資產設有一時普遍之損耗、則市塲之信用貸借、失其平衡、必有大部分之信用、或爲呆滯、或歸虧損、例如行家放於客家之帳面不能收回、行家勢不能償還其對於錢莊之欠欵、銀行即不能收回其對於錢莊之放欵、於是銀行不特不能將其可以收回之欠欵、重行貸放、且須收回其他放欵之一部分、以補不能收回部分之不足、錢莊之對於行家、行家之對於客家、亦復如是、是則固有信用之呆滯虧損、不論爲數若干、而全體市塲信用之緊縮、必至一倍或數倍之、</p>
<p>二十年度政府公債增發三萬八千萬元、全年公債成交總額三十七萬五千七百萬元、内計期貨交易値三十三萬四千一百萬元、現貨交易四萬一千六百萬元、期現交易之比例爲八與一之比、上半年劵價狂漲、下半年雖以時事關係、價格暴跌、然全年平均計算、較之十九年度仍漲四元四角六分、列數如左、</p>

<p>十九年、二十二種六五·一八一００·００</p>
<p>二十年二十七種六九·六四一０六·八四漲百分之七本年度自九月以後劵價日跌、愈趨愈下、今以年終價格、與十九年度、同時比較如後、</p>

<p>十二月份十八種七五·三七一００</p>
<p>二十年元</p>
<p>十二月份　　　　　０、四二六八·　　　　　　信用數量之緊縮、由此可見、</p>
<p>本年度上海地價又繼漲增高、全年成交數目連一萬三千萬兩、公債與地產劇烈臌脹之危險、去年報告中已痛切言之、不意本年度愈趨愈烈、發生穩種不自然之信用臌脹、蓋公債代表一種製造之信用、其所得資金、若不用於生產之途、徒增消費之臌脹、物價之　貴、地價代表一穩製造之人氣使多數中間人、抬高價値、促進交易、競取無生產性之利潤、造成虚僞之繁榮、均非增加眞實之資產、故一旦市面變動、其反動愈大、而影響於信用之收縮更烈、及信用收縮、於是人人收藏現金、而現金愈缺、二十年度杭州造幣廠、添鑄銀幣九千一百三十萬元、而上海市面之現洋存底祇加三千三百七十萬元、二十年底現洋存底爲一萬七千七百五十一萬元、二十年底中國生銀之純進口額有四千五百餘萬海關兩、而上海市面之現銀存底轉减一千八百萬兩、二十年底存底爲五千三百二十一萬三千兩、銀兩之於中國、純爲商業往來之媒介、此一千八百萬兩存底之减少、足以代表若干商業信用之收縮、是以銀拆奇高、二十年度九月以前銀拆最高爲二錢、最低爲無利拆借、至九月以後則最低爲八分、最高爲六錢、循是以往、信用愈縮、現金愈貴、現金愈缺、信用愈减、必致工商業成本愈重、物價愈落、購買分愈弱、工商業之衰敗愈甚、此乃世界市面消沉一定之因果、中國自亦不能免此影響、</p>
<p>所幸中國與世界各國、有一不同之點、世界各國均爲金本位國、一旦信用變動、現金缺乏、硬貨流出國外、動搖幣制基礎、政府勢須頒布現金本位停止之法令、中國爲銀本位國、雖有人民現金之儲藏、尙無國外現金之流出、然工商業之衰頽、社會經濟之崩潰、恐至全國人民十九窮困、我全國人民應當視爲根本之國難、竭力共圖挽救、挽救之道、不外全國上下排除一切不生產的信用之臌脹、節减一切不必要之消費、銀行對於生產事業之信用、勿爲過度之緊縮、人民對於辛勤所得之金錢、勿爲不生產之藏儲、此本行所不得不警告而切望於同胞者也、</p>
<h3>世界繁榮復興之道</h3>

        <h1>1932.03.20</h1>
<h3>Reading the China Bank's 20th Annual Report (1) Bin</h3>
<p>The Bank of China publishes a monthly publication. It reports on the domestic economic situation in China and global economic changes every month. Its statistical figures and material collection are important resources for economic research. Recently, it published its 20th annual report. The investigation and analysis are quite detailed and worthy of social praise.</p>
<p>Last year (1931) was a year of great importance. The global economic downturn intensified last year. In China, the floods and the Japanese invasion caused unprecedented changes in the economic sphere. Therefore, 1931 is a year worthy of special mention. The 20th annual report of the Bank of China can at least represent the views of our financial community. Therefore, it has value that warrants our attention. The report is roughly divided into three parts. The first is the business report of the Bank of China for the 20th year. The second is a statement of domestic and international economic and political changes in the 20th year. The last is to contribute opinions on how to seek world prosperity and recovery. The statistics and materials are quite detailed. The report is also clear and organized. However, we dare not agree with its observations, analysis, and opinions on saving the declining world. Therefore, we present our views for discussion. The first part of the report is the bank's business report. We do not need to offer any discussion here, but examining the nature of its deposits, using the 19th year as an example, the increase in the number of deposit accounts and the increase in deposits from groups and individuals in the 20th year are obvious facts. At the same time, in its second part, there is a report that Shanghai land prices continued to increase in the 20th year, with a total transaction volume of 130 million taels. This proves that our analysis of urban expansion and financiers' special efforts in speculative business in the article "One Year of Economy" at the end of last year was not entirely wrong. Urban expansion is evidence of rural decline. The focus of financiers on speculation is evidence of the decline of our industry. The abnormal state of China's economy is generally revealed here. The second part is a statement of domestic and international economic and political changes in the 20th year. Although the collection of facts is extremely rich, the perception and grasp of reality, and the analysis of the root causes of this result, are as mentioned above. We absolutely dare not agree.</p>
<p>We believe that to understand and analyze the economic and political changes in the world and China in 1931, we must not ignore the major premise that capitalist economics has entered the third stage. As the report states, "Abroad, the market is depressed to the extreme. Overproduction, increased unemployment, and financial panic threaten daily existence. Although governments are busy providing relief, it is like a fire burning, the more it is extinguished, the more fierce it becomes." However, there is a reason for this.</p>
<p>Capitalism has entered the third stage. The reason why its panic is different from that after the war is that the panic after the war was due to the huge destruction during the war. All industries were stagnant. Capital and production felt that supply could not meet demand. The current panic is due to excessive expansion. The strict rationalization of production has made cities more and more inflated and the countryside more and more depressed. The accumulation of products is increasing. The unemployment of capital and people is also increasing. Trade is drastically reduced. Therefore, the panic craze in the financial world cannot be contained once it is triggered, and the more it is rescued, the more fierce it becomes. We must firmly grasp this theoretical clue before we can understand and grasp the reality. Otherwise, we can only tremble before this panic craze, like Keynes sighing: "We are trapped in an unmanageable maze today because we are confused in handling a flexible machine (the capitalist economic machine). We don't understand the rules of this machine at all."</p>
<h3>League of Nations Investigation Team to Inspect War Zone</h3>
<p>Sino-Japanese Agreement on Methods</p>
<p>Investigation Team Expresses Views on the Shanghai Incident</p>
<p>Soong Tzu-wen Hosts Banquet Last Night</p>
<p>The League of Nations Investigation Team, the 500th to arrive in Shanghai yesterday, the team members were busy collecting materials on the Shanghai Incident and meeting with personnel from various countries. They did not go out all day and attended a banquet hosted by Finance Minister Soong Tzu-wen at eight o'clock in the evening. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Inspection of War Zone Methods</h3>
<p>Japanese Side Rejects Participation of Our Press</p>
<p>Limited to Five Chinese Escorts</p>
<p>The League of Nations Investigation Team is scheduled to inspect the war zone on the 21st. The detailed arrangements will be handled by Zhang Xianglin, Director of General Affairs of the Chinese Delegation, and Shiozaki Kansan, Secretary-General of the Japanese Delegation. The two sides agreed the day before yesterday that the number of Chinese escorts would be limited to nine. Hu Shuhua, President of Tongji University, and Wang Jingqi, President of Labor University, are also within the quota of nine. In addition, the Chinese press was to send one representative to participate. Unexpectedly, when Zhang Xianglin met with Shiozaki yesterday, the Japanese side suddenly overturned the previous agreement, stating that the number of Chinese escorts must be changed to a maximum of five, and must be limited to members of the labor group. Others will not be entertained. As for the press, no Japanese reporters will accompany them, so the Chinese press will naturally refuse, etc. Zhang had sent a letter to the Japanese Press Association, requesting them to send a representative to participate, but was temporarily notified to cancel. The five Chinese escorts who have been determined are Gu Weijun's representative and Zhang Xianglin.</p>

<p>As for the inspection procedure, at 9:00 a.m. on the 21st, they will depart from the Bund Cathay Hotel, first go to Zhabei, and then go to Jiangwan and other areas for inspection. As for Wusong, the Japanese side excused that there was not enough time. The final decision will be made by the investigation team itself. Also, the cars used by the investigation team will be prepared by the Chinese side. The Japanese side will have one officer per car to accompany and guide them. Other details are still being discussed by Zhang Xianglin and the Japanese side.</p>
<h3>Expression of the Investigation Team</h3>
<p>According to the mainland newspaper, the League of Nations Investigation Team stated yesterday that it will leave for Beijing around next Tuesday or Wednesday. It also stated that the team decided not to participate in any negotiations between China and Japan. This kind of participation is not within its scope of duties. If the negotiations are frustrated, the team can be requested to provide guidance, but this must be requested by both parties. If the war resumes after the team leaves Shanghai, Geneva can ask it to return to Shanghai. If there is no such request, it will not come again. As for the report of the team's investigation, it will be published after the trip is completed and submitted to the League of Nations General Assembly.</p>
<h3>Conversation with Sir Lytton</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Sir Lytton, the chief representative of the League of Nations Investigation Team, told reporters that since his arrival in Shanghai, he has not reported on the Shanghai Incident except for telegraphing Geneva to report his arrival. He now intends to send a detailed telegram to Geneva after inspecting the battlefield to conclude the investigation in Shanghai. As for the Sino-Japanese ceasefire conference, it has just begun. I believe there will be good news to report to you soon.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Peace Conference</h3>

<p>Another Meeting Tomorrow with Hopes for Signing</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of a ceasefire in Shanghai and the withdrawal of Japanese troops, representatives from China, Japan, and related countries held two formal meetings at the British Consulate yesterday. After four hours of negotiations, concrete methods were generally agreed upon. Chinese and Japanese representatives will hold another meeting tomorrow, Monday, with hopes for signing.</p>
<h3>Formal Meeting Process</h3>
<p>Representatives from China, Japan, and related countries have been drafting three basic principles for the ceasefire conference based on the resolution of the League of Nations Council on March 4th since Monday in the tea party of the British Minister's official residence. Due to instructions from the Japanese government, the Japanese Minister Shigemitsu Aoi notified the British Minister Lampson until the night before last, which was then forwarded to our side. The formal ceasefire conference was also delayed until yesterday before it was held at the British Consulate.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Negotiation Situation</h3>
<p>Representatives from China, Japan, and related countries held two meetings at the British Consulate yesterday. The first meeting was from 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., and the second meeting was from 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. Those present were Vice Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi, Japanese Minister Shigemitsu Aoi, British Minister Lampson, American Minister Johnson, French Minister Wilder, and Italian Chargé d'Affaires Ciano. No military representatives from any side participated. The meetings lasted for four hours. At the end of the meeting, British Minister Lampson personally escorted the representatives out, looking quite happy. When reporters from this newspaper met with the representatives separately after the meeting, they all said that the progress was good. French Minister Wilder felt a little unwell these days and left a few minutes early each time.</p>
<h3>Ceasefire and Troop Withdrawal Methods</h3>
<p>The methods for a ceasefire and the withdrawal of Japanese troops were generally agreed upon at the two meetings yesterday. The morning meeting was based on the three basic principles drafted on Monday, namely (1) Chinese troops will be stationed in their current positions pending future resolution; (2) Japanese troops will withdraw into the Public Concession and the roads outside the Concession in the Hongkou area, but some Japanese troops may temporarily be stationed in areas adjacent to the aforementioned locations; (3) A joint Sino-Japanese committee including neutral nationals will be organized to monitor the withdrawal of troops by both sides. At the morning meeting yesterday, these three articles were further understood. The afternoon meeting discussed the details, such as determining (1) the locations where Chinese troops are currently stationed; (2) the locations where Japanese troops will withdraw; (3) the powers of the joint committee.</p>
<h3>Troop Withdrawal Date Undecided</h3>
<p>Vice Minister Guo and Japanese Minister Shigemitsu Aoi telegraphed the Nanjing and Tokyo governments last night, respectively, requesting instructions. It is expected that the replies from both sides will arrive in Shanghai today. Therefore, it has been agreed to hold another meeting tomorrow, Monday. If there are no unexpected changes, it can be signed. At that time, military representatives from all sides will also participate. The designated Chinese military representatives are Commander-in-Chief Jiang Guangnai of the 19th Route Army and Garrison Commander Dai Ji of Songhu. The Japanese military representatives will be Commander Shirakawa of the Japanese Army and Commander Nomura of the Navy. The British, American, French, and Italian sides will be represented by the naval commanders stationed in Shanghai. The date of the Japanese troop withdrawal was not decided at yesterday's meeting. It will probably be decided at the final meeting attended by military representatives from all sides.</p>
<h3>Press Release from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued the following press release last night: The first Sino-Japanese peace and ceasefire conference was held twice today, at 10:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m., at the British Consulate General in Shanghai. Those present were the ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, the Italian Chargé d'Affaires, and Guo and Shigemitsu, six people. Military representatives from all sides have not yet attended. Both meetings discussed concrete methods for implementing the ceasefire and the withdrawal of Japanese troops, which have been generally drafted. The Nanjing government has been telegraphed for instructions. After the reply is received, all details will be announced. Questions regarding political issues and the so-called round table conference were not discussed today.</p>
<h3>Various Groups and National Salvation Associations Express Views on Peace Negotiations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Federation of National Salvation Associations issued a declaration regarding the peace negotiations: This peace negotiation is extremely welcome by the entire city's population. However, the peace process must first be based on the League of Nations resolution and free from the pressure of force before it can proceed. The peace plan must not hinder territorial integrity or political independence as basic principles. Those who use force to destroy our country's territorial administration must be subject to legitimate sanctions and bear corresponding compensation. Based on the above premise, this association makes the following two recognitions, and these recognitions stipulate the principles to be jointly observed: (1) If peace negotiations proceed while Japanese troops have not completely withdrawn from our country's territory and under the pressure of the Japanese army, it will violate the League of Nations resolution. (2) If the result of the peace negotiations causes any changes in the administrative content or form within our territory, or restricts the actions of our troops within our territory, it will destroy territorial integrity and political independence. (3) If the peace negotiations do not include sanctions for the abuse of force and compensation for public and private losses in the war zone, it will be contrary to the spirit of safeguarding territorial integrity and political independence. If any of these three occur, it will hinder the survival of our nation and the independence of our country. At the same time, it violates the League of Nations Covenant, the Washington Nine-Power Treaty, the Paris Peace Pact, and the resolutions of the League of Nations Administrative Council and General Assembly. The various groups affiliated with this federation absolutely oppose it. This declaration is hereby made, and we ask for your public review.</p>
<h3>Jiang Guangnai and Others Telegraph Use of Donations</h3>
<p>Used for Resistance and National Salvation</p>
<p>Announced at Appropriate Time</p>
<p>Guangnai and others telegraphed: All newspapers, for the public view of compatriots across the country: Our army is resisting Japan on the Shanghai coast, and we are grateful to patriotic compatriots at home and abroad who share our hatred of the enemy and enthusiastically provide assistance. Soldiers know benevolence when they are given cotton-padded jackets, and horses whip themselves faster. The reason why we have been able to hold our weapons and fight against the powerful enemy to this day is also due to the encouragement and inspiration of the blood and sweat of our compatriots. Our army has been serving the country for more than ten years, and what we have always been committed to is being practical and not wasting money. Moreover, every grain and every penny is entrusted to us by our compatriots for national salvation, and we must ensure that every grain and every penny is used for resistance and national salvation. Therefore, since the righteous donations were distributed, we have designated their use for the following items: compensation for wounded and dead soldiers, one; as a special activity fund for the entire army, two; to supplement the lack of military supplies, three. Based on this allocation, all receipts and expenditures are listed in the ledger and carefully preserved. Since the enemy has not been eliminated and we are still in a period of continuous combat, we should temporarily keep the general military situation confidential. When the time is appropriate, we will immediately announce it at home and abroad to show our credibility and to make the feelings of our compatriots who have ruined their families to relieve the country clear to the world. Our army's ambition to serve the country without deception is the same as pointing to the mountains and rivers. We respectfully place our words of testimony and express our gratitude. We cannot express our expectations and longing in this telegram. Jiang Guangnai, Cai Tingkai, and Dai Ji bow together.</p>

We beg you to treat each member with sincerity and let them contribute as much as possible. Gentlemen can accept advice, and ordinary people can entrust their lives. The conference period of five days is relatively short and should be extended. The conference venue should be changed to Nanjing for more convenience, which is the hope of the people.

<h3>Declaration of the Establishment of the Society for the Support of the Widows and Orphans of Fallen Soldiers Who Defended the Nation</h3>
<p>The Society for the Support of the Widows and Orphans of Fallen Soldiers Who Defended the Nation held its inaugural meeting yesterday (the 19th) at 4:00 PM. More than fifty people attended, including Xu Shiying, Wang Yiting, Pan Gongzhan, Zhu Ziqiao, and Du Yuesheng. Xu Shiying was publicly elected as chairman. The meeting proceeded as planned, including a three-minute silence to honor the fallen soldiers. The chairman first reported on: (1) the preparation process, and (2) the amount of fundraising. Immediately after that, the following resolutions were discussed and passed: (1) The name was determined to be the Society for the Support of the Widows and Orphans of Fallen Soldiers Who Defended the Nation; (2) Nineteen articles of the constitution were amended (omitted); (3) A declaration was issued; (4) A request was sent to the central government for filing; (5) Executive and supervisory committee members were elected. The meeting adjourned at 7:00 PM. Now, the declaration is presented as follows:</p>
<p>The principle of the Spring and Autumn Annals values those who die for the state. Whether seen in bright pronouncements or in exemplary decrees, all emphasize rewarding merit, honoring virtue, comforting the dead, and encouraging the living, so as to stimulate the spirit of the people and influence people's hearts. Unfortunately, on January 28th of this year, Japan, with its military force and brutality, invaded Shanghai. Since the Jiawu War, Japan has repeatedly invaded our country's territory, but how many people have profoundly understood the great righteousness of the nation and dared to resist the enemy with isolated troops? On September 18th of last year, Japan forcibly occupied Shenyang, and the land and people of the three northeastern provinces were all lost under the policy of non-resistance, leading to the occupation of the area east of Yuguan. On January 28th of this year, Japan intensified its ferocity, threatening our maritime borders. Our 19th Route Army, responsible for defending the territory in the Jinghu area, resolutely resisted the enemy, fighting for the nation's survival and for the existence of the nation's territory. For more than a month, they fought against bullets with their flesh and blood. The Fifth Army, known for its benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, courage, and dedication, also fought alongside the military police and volunteers, sacrificing themselves for the country. Their righteous reputation has spread far and wide, admired by all. Among the hundreds of battles, large and small, since the founding of the Republic of China, none can match the bravery of this battle, nor can any match the glory of this battle. The merit of this battle is, on a small scale, to defend a corner of the country's territory, and on a large scale, to fight for the nation's survival for ten thousand years. In private, it is to preserve the glorious name of the descendants of the Yellow Emperor. In public, it is to uphold justice for all the nations of the world. Not only is the spirit of fearless advance, disregard for personal safety, broken legs and pierced torsos, and one falling and another following, enough to shock heaven and earth and move ghosts and gods, but also the blood-soaked Chen Tao cries in grief for the unreturned sons and daughters, and the sacrificed Sui Tang asks where the orphans and widows are. Horses neigh in the wilderness, and the green flames connect with the eerie light. Flowers bloom on the battlefield, and white bones accumulate like mountains of corpses. Today, the brave men who sacrifice for the country on the battlefield, and the brave warriors who will continue to fight in the long-term resistance in the future, who does not have parents? Who does not have a family? Since the generals and soldiers who defended the nation have contributed their loyal hearts and righteous courage to our entire nation, our entire nation should contribute its heart, effort, and wealth to reward and honor them. This is why the members of this society are deeply saddened, and in addition to providing medical care for the wounded and rescuing the dying, they have initiated this Society for the Support of the Widows and Orphans of Fallen Soldiers Who Defended the Nation. Rewarding merit and honoring virtue are explicitly stipulated in national law, but caring for the elderly and nurturing orphans are the special responsibilities of society. The members of this society have limited abilities, and their hope for the support of fellow countrymen across the country is extremely sincere and great. Whether individuals or groups, all who are willing to assist with money or ability are welcomed by this society. Gathering together small contributions to make a large one, accomplishing this great undertaking depends on the elders, brothers, sisters, aunts, and sisters of the whole country. This declaration is hereby made.</p>
<h3>Wu Mai Released on Bail, Returned to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Jiangxi Provincial Association Cables for Formal Release</p>
<p>Wu Mai, the director of publicity for the National Lawyers Association, was arrested on the 12th of this month for going to the Municipal Public Security Bureau to request the release on bail of representatives of the arrested Middle School Joint Association, which led to a conflict with Wu Zhiquan, the third section chief. Subsequently, a secret central order was issued to escort Wu to Beijing. The Beijing-Shanghai Garrison Headquarters, because Wu was ill, ordered him to seek bail for recuperation outside. Wu then asked the Jiangxi Association in Beijing to provide bail the night before to secure his temporary release. Wu immediately set off back to Shanghai and arrived safely home in Shen yesterday evening. According to a reporter from the Wu Yu Xin Sheng News Agency, he left Shanghai at 2:00 AM on the 16th, was escorted to Beijing on the afternoon of the 17th to the private residence of Chen Mingshu, where he was treated quite well. Later, because his body was seriously injured from beatings, the Jiangxi Association in Beijing provided bail for his release. He regained his freedom last night and arrived in Shanghai tonight. After Wu arrived in Shanghai, many parties were still working hard for him, hoping that the authorities would formally release him. The Jiangxi Association in Shanghai yesterday cabled the Beijing-Shanghai Garrison Headquarters, requesting Wu's formal release. The cable read:</p>
<p>To Commander Jiang of the Nanjing Beijing-Shanghai Garrison Headquarters: News reports indicate that fellow townsman Wu Mai, a lawyer, was detained for a conflict with Section Chief Wu of the Public Security Bureau while trying to bail out students. Judging from the facts, at most, it was only obstruction of official duties. However, yesterday's newspaper suddenly stated that he was being escorted to your department and will be punished by military law. Upon hearing this news, we were shocked and bewildered. Upon investigation, Wu has always been righteous, courageous, anti-Japanese, and anti-communist. He was especially enthusiastic. During the recent bloody battle in Shanghai by the 19th Route Army, Wu ran around calling for support and encouraging the people. He provided much assistance. He also personally expressed his gratitude to Brigade Commander Weng Zhaoyuan when comforting the soldiers on the front lines. His straightforwardness is evident. However, he is quick-tempered, outspoken, and has offended powerful figures. He was indeed forced by righteous indignation and had absolutely no partisan political motives. This is what everyone in society knows and what our fellow townsmen are well aware of. The central government is now striving for freedom of speech. If military law is hastily applied to such a trivial matter, the severity of the punishment would be disproportionate and greatly violate the principle of guiding the people to save the country, chilling the hearts of patriots. We earnestly request that your department investigate the truth, consider the original circumstances, and promptly grant formal release. This would greatly encourage the people and not only Wu's individual and family would be forever grateful. We submit this truthful statement, hoping for your consideration. Jiangxi Association in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Commercial Press Refutes Japanese Residents' Sophistry</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury published the previous day contained sophistry from the chairman of the local Japanese Residents Association concerning the bombing of the Commercial Press, during a meeting with members of a Japanese Christian inspection group visiting Shanghai from Japan. Yesterday, according to a certain important staff member of the Press, the North-China Daily News had also published an essay during the Shanghai Incident on February 6th, which claimed that the textbooks published by the Commercial Press promoted anti-Japanese sentiments. The Press believed that this unfounded theory was easy to cause misunderstandings, so it sent a letter to the newspaper stating that the textbooks of the Press adopted diplomatic materials and only presented facts. There are many aspects of Chinese international relations that have historical value, and sometimes offending others is unavoidable when stating the truth, but it should not be considered to intentionally promote xenophobia. It also stated that the North-China Daily News, also a publisher, should deeply understand the difficulty of this. This letter was published in the February 13th issue of the North-China Daily News, showing that the foreign press can also understand this point. As for the Japanese claim that the Press was used as a bastion by Chinese troops, according to the staff member, this is also a reversal of cause and effect. Before the Japanese aircraft bombing, there were absolutely no troops or plainclothes soldiers at the main factory and affiliated organizations of the Press. The day after the war started, aircraft flew low around the factory and frequently dropped bombs. The guards stationed at the factory were not only unable to extinguish the fire, but also dared not stay. However, before leaving the factory, everyone said that no Chinese soldiers had entered. After the destruction, the troops on both sides repeatedly advanced and retreated, mutually using it as a bastion, which is also a possible fact. If the Japanese army had not intentionally destroyed this cultural institution in the first place, then the buildings and equipment of the Press in Zhabei, worth more than ten million, would not have been completely reduced to scorched earth.</p>
<h3>Winter Grain Tax Postponed for Another Two Months</h3>
<p>Notice from the Municipal Land Bureau</p>
<p>The Land Bureau issued a notice yesterday stating: "Regarding the matter of issuing another notice, according to the collection period for the Municipal Bureau's collection of the winter grain tax, reed tax, Jinshan auxiliary transport and garrison rent for the 20th year, the deadline was the 15th of February of this year. Unfortunately, the war broke out, traffic was disrupted, and payment was scarce. Permission was granted to extend the deadline for one month to March 15th. Now, it has been found that the extended period has also expired, and people are still not enthusiastically submitting payments. For the sake of extra consideration for the people, the Bureau has once again requested an extension of the collection period for two months. Order No. 640 of the Municipal Government states, 'It has been noted that the request has been approved to extend the deadline for another two months to show consideration. The notice should be publicized for everyone to be aware of.' Therefore, it is appropriate to issue another notice to inform all the people of the city that the deadline for the winter grain tax, reed tax, Jinshan auxiliary transport and garrison rent for the 20th year will be extended for two months from March 16th to May 15th. During the extended period, all must submit payments promptly, make receipts, and establish businesses, without delay. Be sure to do so. This notice."</p>
<h3>Various Groups Held a Meeting of Representatives Yesterday to Discuss Rent Reduction</h3>
<p>Since the tragic events in the city, Zhabei, Jiangwan, Wusong, and other areas have been reduced to rubble. Even in the so-called safe areas, many businesses have suspended operations to resist the enemy, resulting in an inability to afford rent. Various groups have proposed rent reductions.

<p>(2) A proposal on how the committee's expenses should be financed was discussed and resolved that the expenses would be temporarily advanced by the groups present at the meeting.</p>
<p>(3) A proposal on how to proceed with discussions on rent reduction methods was discussed and resolved to entrust the committee to review the situation in each district and formulate rent reduction methods.</p>
<p>(4) A proposal that the committee should issue a declaration was discussed and resolved to have Cao Zhishi and Sun Mingqi draft it.</p>
<p>(5) A proposal that the committee's rules and regulations should be drafted by designated personnel was resolved to have Wang Manyun, Yu Hualong, and Yuan Hongjun be responsible for drafting them.</p>

<h3>American Gunboat Arrives in Shanghai</h3>

He came to Shanghai on May 17th of last year and served as the commander of the French Defense Forces stationed in Shanghai. During the Zhabei Incident, Maguer maintained the security of the concession with great diligence.</p>
<h3>Japanese Censorship of News</h3>
<p>Leads to a Proliferation of Rumors</p>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports that, apart from the brief Reuters dispatch that the situation was still dangerous when parliament opened, little else has been heard about important news regarding the severe political situation in Japan that has been passed by the censor. Japan has always taken a strict approach to censoring news, but has recently intensified its efforts to prevent details of the political, economic and social crises, which may cause a general party uprising, from reaching foreign countries. News from Tokyo is now subject to censorship, leading to a proliferation of rumors in Shanghai. There are reports that a general strike has been implemented in Tokyo, but none of them have been confirmed. What is now known is that the Inukai Tsuyoshi cabinet is shaky and is trying to organize a supra-party government in order to temporarily curb the reactionary trend.</p>

<h3>Preliminary Estimates of Losses from the Shanghai Incident</h3>
<p>Since Shanghai was invaded by Japanese troops, the losses have been enormous. Accurate statistics are most needed. Wu Dajun, director of statistics of the Central Party Headquarters and acting director of the National Government's Bureau of Statistics, recently came to Shanghai to investigate various parties and will compile a complete set of statistics. The preliminary estimates of the losses from the Shanghai Incident within the Shanghai urban area are recorded below (compiled by the Central Statistical Office).</p>

However, the areas belonging to Jiading, Jinshan, Taicang, and other counties cannot be reported due to traffic disruptions and there are no old cases to refer to, so estimates cannot be made. Therefore, the investigation will take quite some time. First, preliminary estimates are made of the losses suffered within the area under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Municipal Government (including Zhabei, Wusong, Jiangwan, Zhenru, Yinxiang, Yinhang, Pengpu, and the Southern District, Special District, etc.). More accurate statistics will be made when the investigation is complete.

<h3>Barge Industry's Appeal Regarding the Sealing of Boats</h3>
<p>The Water Patrol Team of the Public Security Bureau, acting under orders, has been sealing boats for the transport of military pay and equipment for half a month. The barge industry is suffering greatly and has appealed to the authorities for understanding, but has not received a response. However, according to reliable information from the military authorities, there is currently no need and no orders have been given to seal more boats. Therefore, the barge industry in Pudong has sent a letter to the Pudong Fellow-Countrymen Association, explaining the various malpractices and requesting that it be forwarded to the Municipal Government for strict investigation and that this harsh measure be immediately revoked.</p>
<h3>Draft Budget for the Public Works Department This Year</h3>
<p>The Finance Committee of the Public Works Department of the Public Concession held a committee meeting on Friday afternoon. The Chief Accountant presented the final draft budget for 1932 and provided explanations, stating that in the 1931 fiscal year, there was a surplus of 251,000 taels in regular revenue and expenditure, slightly higher than the original budget of 313,000 taels. This was due to the efforts of various departments of the Public Works Department to economize on expenses, as well as the extended exchange rate in the second half of the year and adjustments between capital expenditures and municipal revenue. As for the 1932 budget (with the patrol fee still collected at 14%), the education fee is initially proposed at 1,384,000 taels, separately listed in the budget. The general budget totals 15,500,000 taels in expenditures. On the revenue side, after appropriately reducing the losses from the martial law period tax revenue and deducting the education expenses, it totals approximately 14,312,000 taels. To balance revenue and expenditure, it is necessary to allocate 1,250,000 taels from the general reserve fund (approximately equivalent to nine months of patrol fee revenue at 2%). After the allocation, there will be a surplus of approximately 11,000 taels. As for the special budget for investments, most of the large-scale construction projects are those that started last year, and the plan to redeem public bonds will continue to be implemented as before. In addition, 800,000 taels will be reserved for temporary emergency expenses. However, regarding revenue, it is still necessary to raise another 2,000,000 taels, either by issuing public bonds or by other means. The total amount of this budget is 18,914,000 taels, with a surplus of approximately 84,000 taels.</p>

<h3>Members Must Carry Representative Certificates</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent a letter to various trade associations stating that the Chamber will move back to its original address on North Suzhou Road from the Ningbo Fellow-Countrymen Association starting on the 20th of this month for business.

Later additions were Yang Baokang and Yu Qinxia, also ladies. The group initially planned to hold a tea dance to raise funds for the Northeast Volunteer Army. When the Shanghai Incident occurred, they shifted their spirit of assisting the Northeast Volunteer Army to assisting the soldiers at the ten front lines. Their work was divided into fundraising and service. A total of 3,278 yuan was raised. A special executive committee was formed to investigate the needs of the front lines and military hospitals. The soldiers in the injured soldier hospital set up by the orthopedic hospital were mostly seriously injured in the bones, and many needed to be fed at mealtimes. The caretakers in the hospital were insufficient. The group then sent several members in groups to serve in the hospital. In addition to rushing to make 300 sets of shirts and pants to send to the front lines and 200 sets of flannel shirts and pants to send to the injured soldier hospital, the group also made 305 silk floss vests for the Anti-Japanese Joint Association of professors from various universities in Shanghai. The rest of the funds were used to make bed sheets and tarpaulins for the wounded soldiers and to bring food for慰勞. This is only a part of the group's work. Currently, the group still has a surplus of funds (detailed receipts and expenditures can be found in yesterday's Shen Bao advertisement). The front lines are in dire need, and the group plans to continue its work.</p>

Mr. Yu's enthusiasm is truly commendable.</p>
<h3>Lianyi Charity Association Appeals for Help with Coffins</h3>
<p>To whom it may concern, since the sudden outbreak of the Shanghai war, corpses have littered the war zones of Zhabei, Wusong, and Datian. As spring warms, the stench of decay rises, and epidemics are feared. Various public welfare and charitable organizations in Shanghai, recognizing this, have jointly organized the Shanghai War Zone Temporary Burial Office to specifically handle burial and disinfection work, to appease the souls of the dead and prevent epidemics among the living. It has been decided to actively proceed. Our association is one of the charitable organizations, and in addition to doing our best to relieve refugees, we will do our utmost for burial matters. However, we believe that this is a major undertaking that requires the support of everyone to be successful. We hope that all directors, members, and people from all walks of life will take pity and generously contribute, whether it be coffins, planks, or silver coins, the more the better, and every little bit helps, to benefit the people and society. The merits will be immeasurable. If you can generously donate, we will be eternally grateful. We sincerely request your attention. Shanghai Lianyi Charity Association.</p>

<h3>Qiyuan Buddhist Association Expands Shelter</h3>
<p>The Qiyuan Buddhist Association Temporary Shelter for Refugee Women and Children, located across from the Sino-French School in the French Concession, has already sheltered over eight or nine hundred people.

The hygiene equipment is well-prepared, and the staff is working tirelessly day and night. The director of general affairs, surnamed Feng, has lost his voice due to his hard work, which shows his enthusiasm. However, the expenses are quite large, and it is deeply hoped that all sectors will donate silver dollars, cotton quilts, and food to provide relief. It would truly be a great merit.</p>

In addition to providing education and care, the association heard yesterday that thousands of refugees from Jiading and Taicang had fled to Qingpu Zhujieg, Wu Jiaqiao, and other places. This morning, the association dispatched a rescue team led by Ling Youguang and members Qi Nvyang, Zhou Lixuan, and others, a total of nine people, on a rented Hanshen small steamer and two tugboats to provide rescue. It is also heard that refugees from Kunyou, Shatou, and other places are continuously arriving, but because there are no small steamers, they have not yet been able to go. They plan to depart as soon as the Qingpu small steamer returns.</p>
<h3>Women from All Over Strive for Relief</h3>
<p>The National Association of the Chinese YWCA has received letters from the YWCAs in Tianjin, Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and other places in recent days, reporting that they are all working very hard for national disaster relief. For example, organizing "Patriotic Women's Ten-Person Groups," "Rescue Teams," and "Relief Associations." In particular, the work in Guangzhou is even more intense. Mrs. Huang Sao, Mrs. Zhong Rongguang, Ms. Luo Youjie, and others from the Guangzhou YWCA have contacted women from all walks of life and launched a "Guangzhou Women's Refugee Relief Association." Since its establishment, it has been enthusiastically supported by people from all walks of life and has achieved great results. The purpose of this association is specifically to collect relief clothing, food, and medicine, and many donations have been collected, totaling more than 19,000 items, large and small, like a mountain. The quantity is truly amazing. More than 230 packages have been transported to Shanghai and handed over to the National Disaster Relief Committee of the local YWCA for handling. It is heard that the association has delivered the relief items received to the Citizens' Maintenance Association for distribution.</p>
<h3>YMCA Strives to Rescue Refugees</h3>
<p>The Shanghai YMCA, since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, has temporarily suspended its regular affairs and devoted itself to relief work. Since January 29, it has opened its Sichuan Road location to shelter people in distress in the Zhabei area. The number of people sheltered has totaled more than 2,000. Most are Cantonese. It is cooperating with the Guangzhao Association to maintain this. After this part of the refugees moved away from the war zone, some returned home on their own, while those who had no home to return to were sent back to their hometowns. The association also realized that the war zone was vast, and there were many refugees, so the Sichuan Road location had limited space and could not accommodate enough. The association's schools also urgently needed to open, and there were various other inconveniences. Therefore, it specially rented the Central Research Institute across from the Zhaofeng Garden on Yuyuan Road as a war zone refugee shelter and cooperated with the Shanghai Citizens' Local Maintenance Association to provide rice and grain. Since it started on February 27, it has sheltered more than 7,000 refugees. Among them, 1,881 were sent back to their hometowns, 2,312 left the shelter on their own and returned home, 4 children died, 1 adult died, and 4 children were born. There are currently 1,764 refugees in the shelter. The association believes that although the war has temporarily stopped, it has not yet left the dangerous period, so relief work will continue. Recently, a new plan has been made. Since the refugees have no home to return to and their future lives are bleak, we should actively seek resettlement solutions for them. On the one hand, we will collect spring and summer clothes, and on the other hand, we will plan to raise funds to hold an interest-free loan program, so that refugees can borrow money to make a living. This is a fundamental relief method. The association is currently working on fundraising. If any enthusiastic people are willing to donate clothing, medicine, or money, please send it directly to the Shanghai YMCA at 201 Sichuan Road.</p>
<h3>Punishing Scoundrels Who Steal During the Disaster</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Local Court, through the Public Security Bureau, received more than 200 scoundrels from Zhabei arrested by the concession police for robbing the property of residents. The court judges, considering that these criminals were insane and that if they were not prosecuted, there would be no way to warn lawbreakers and maintain public order, invoked the articles of the criminal law for stealing during a disaster and sentenced all the bandits to prison terms of one to four years.</p>

<h3>Improvement of Extortion Tactics</h3>
<p>Previously only sending letters, now holding guns for face-to-face talks.</p>
<p>A nephew suggests gathering accomplices to extort his uncle.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, at the residence of Yang Yu-jin, number 15 Fuyou Lane, Fuyou Road, Section 2, an unexpected guest arrived. This person, wielding a pistol, barged into the house and threatened Yang, demanding a loan of 2,000 silver dollars. Yang negotiated the amount down to 400 or 500 dollars, which was accepted. It was agreed that someone would be sent with a letter at 11:30 AM the next day to collect the money, with no delays permitted. Yang immediately reported the incident to the police station of Section 2, requesting their presence during the money collection to make an arrest. Police Chief Li Fuyi and other officers were instructed by Station Chief Yi to discreetly surround Yang's residence and keep a close watch. As scheduled, a woman named Wu Liu Lan-ying arrived with a letter and was immediately apprehended. At the same time, a man named Gu Yao-fang, found loitering and observing near the alley entrance, was also arrested. Subsequently, another man named Zhang Zhi-liang, looking flustered, was apprehended. All were taken to the station for preliminary interrogation. Initially, the suspects denied the allegations. However, after handwriting analysis, significant suspicion fell upon Gu Yao-fang and others. Station Chief Yi conducted further questioning, during which Zhang Zhi-liang confessed that he was 25 years old, from Ningbo, and resided at number 173 West Zilaihuo Street in the French Concession. He used to work on ships but was currently unemployed. He was introduced to Li A-bing by a friend named Yang A-lu, and they became close. On the eighth day of this month, Zhang went with Li A-bing to the residence of Yang A-lu's mistress, where they discussed their financial difficulties. Yang A-lu suggested that they borrow money from his wealthy uncle, Yang Yu-jin. Zhang asked how to do it, and A-lu said that Li A-bing had many schemes and would figure something out. A-bing then said that he had a pistol and could use it to scare him into lending the money. After the discussion, they dispersed. On the ninth day, Zhang went to the Wuzhou Hotel, where A-bing said that he had already visited the Yang family, asking for a loan of 2,000 silver dollars. Yang only agreed to 400 or 500 dollars and arranged for A-bing's mistress, Liu Lan-ying, to collect the money the next day. Zhang was instructed to watch from behind, in case A-bing's mistress tried to run away with the money. Wu Liu Lan-ying confessed that she was from Yangzhou, 27 years old, and resided at number 13 Xincun Lane, Tangshan Road. She used to work in a cigarette factory but left on the nineteenth day of the twelfth lunar month after her child died. She met Li A-bing on the street and went with him to a hotel in the French Concession for one night. She ended up staying there for over twenty days. Later, they opened the Wuzhou Hotel, but were struggling financially and had to pawn their clothes to make ends meet. Zhang Zi-liang and Li A-bing were friends and saw each other often. There was also a tall friend, whose name she didn't know. They were all short on money and discussed borrowing money from a Yang family in Xinbeimen. On the ninth day of the lunar month, A-bing didn't return for a night. On the morning of the tenth day, he gave her a letter, instructing her to go to the Yang family in Xinbeimen to collect the money. She came with Gu Yao-fang, who was to keep watch outside. Li A-bing had a pistol, which he brought back to the hotel on the ninth day. Gu Yao-fang confessed that he was from Kunshan, 29 years old, and currently resided in the Tianchan Stage, where he sold newspapers. He met Li A-bing in January when A-bing came to his stall to read the newspaper. On the morning of the tenth day, A-bing came to him, asking him to accompany his mistress, Wu Liu Lan-ying, to borrow money from the Yang family in Xinbeimen. Gu was to keep watch outside and was paid four small silver coins. Station Chief Yi concluded the interrogation and, regarding the case as a conspiracy to extort, ordered the strict pursuit and arrest of Yang A-lu and Li A-bing. Wu Liu Lan-ying and the other two were sent to the bureau for further investigation and handling.</p>
<p>A Wang family in Taoyuanfang was robbed.</p>
<h3>Two Robbers and Three Guns Captured at the Scene</h3>
<p>Yesterday at 10:15 AM, at the residence of the Wang family, number 37 Taoyuanfang, Lafayette Road, four robbers suddenly appeared, each wielding a pistol. They threatened the occupants into silence and confined them all to one room. Then, they divided up to search the house thoroughly, leaving no corner unturned. They stole gold jewelry, silver dollars, and valuable fur coats, totaling over 2,000 silver dollars. Carrying the stolen goods, they fled in different directions. Three of the robbers fled east towards the intersection of Rue Cardinal Mercier. Coincidentally, patrol detectives from the French Concession police station were passing by and noticed the three men running frantically. They immediately ordered them to stop. As the detectives approached to search them, the three men broke into a run. The detectives gave chase and captured two of them on the spot, seizing a pistol and a Mauser pistol, along with a large amount of the stolen goods. The third robber escaped into a nearby residence. When the detectives followed him inside, the robber had already escaped through the back door and disappeared. According to residents of the house, when the robber ran in, he quickly threw something into the toilet before fleeing out the back door. The detectives immediately ordered the toilet to be emptied, revealing a loaded pistol. The two captured robbers were taken to the police station, awaiting transfer to the court for punishment.</p>

<h3>Complex Gold Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market was weak but firm, with complex conditions and a seemingly softening trend. In the morning, prices hovered around 670 taels. This was due to divergent trends in the silver market, with the British pound rising and the US dollar falling. Citibank's buying activity led to a lower opening. Trading activity among dealers varied greatly. While exchange rates were loose then stable, bank buying was not quiet. Furthermore, there was heavy buying on the trading floor, with rumors of a certain bank purchasing cash gold. Prices rose from below 670 taels to above 678 taels, eventually rising by more than two taels. However, market sentiment remained uncertain. In the afternoon, due to it being Saturday, there was no market as usual. The detailed account of the morning's trading is as follows: At 9:30 AM, the May contract opened down 1.80 yuan at 673.50 taels. The big silver bars rebounded, while the US dollar fell, so the gold market was not excessively influenced by profit or loss. Xianling and others kept their prices unchanged. Dalian Gang and Yuan Maoyong and others entered the market to buy, rebounding by one tael to 74.50 yuan. It then retreated to 72 yuan due to selling. However, the internal US dollar price was stable. Chen Fengyong and others sold to Huahai Bank the June contract at 32.875 yuan. Yuan Maoyuan and Hong Kangyong both entered the market, and prices jumped up by about four taels to 75.80 yuan. Afterwards, exchange rates seemed clumsy, with the April British gold trading at 75 and the US dollar at 33 yuan. In addition, Zhifengyong and retail investors were actively selling, leading to a sluggish trend and a sudden drop below 70 taels, to 68.80 yuan at 10:00 AM. There were fluctuations of two or more yuan in between. Later, a certain bank absorbed cash, and Qian Changxiang and others competed to buy, pushing the price back above 70 taels. At that time, the Shanghai price for the April US dollar was 32.875 yuan, so gold prices continued to rise by two or three taels, reaching 76 taels at 11:00 AM. At that time, retail investors were selling, bringing the price down to 74.30 yuan. Near 11:40 AM, Yu and others bought in, pushing the price up to 78.50 yuan. Soon after, two taels were shaved off, bringing the price down to 76.50 yuan. However, short-sellers and retail investors were covering their positions, because today (the 20th) is Sunday, so there is no market as usual, and positions must be squared. At noon, the market closed at 78 taels, up 2.70 yuan from the previous noon (it has risen for three consecutive days, totaling more than 14 taels). The highest price of the morning was 78.50 taels, and the lowest was 68.80 taels, a fluctuation of 9.70 taels. The announced price remained at 741 taels, and the pressed price was 70 taels to 63 taels, slightly less than the three taels pressed the previous day. The registered prices were 70 taels for March, 72 taels for April, 78 taels for May, and a premium of 71 taels. The bare bars were reduced by two taels compared to the spot price due to rollover considerations. According to trading floor statistics, Heng Xingyuan, Qian Zaogan, Hong Kangyong, Yuan Maoyuan, Taiyifeng, Yong Shenkang, and others were all buying. Yuan Maoyong, Heng Yufu, and Taiheng bought and then sold. Zhifengyong, Kaitai, and many retail investors were all selling. The arbitrageurs were said to be buying.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>A telegram from Tianjin says, "To the Shen Bao,</p>
<p>After reading the reports in the Zhenwen Daily and other newspapers in March that Ma Yuren's troops colluded with Japanese spies at the Liu River floating bridge, marked with red and green signs, allowing Japanese pirates to land, I am deeply astonished. I, Yuren, left the army years ago, and my subordinates have long been disbanded. I have been living quietly in Tianjin, uninvolved in national affairs. Moreover, with the national crisis at hand, I yearn for the whole country to unite and defend against the enemy with one heart and one mind, seeking to save the country. How could I bear to lead wolves into the house, acting madly and heartlessly? Although I am retired, my patriotic heart dares not lag behind others in resisting Japan and saving the nation. I hope that the editor-in-chief will correct and publish this, for which I am endlessly grateful. Ma Yuren."</p>

Its second article stipulates, "The Contracting Parties agree that the settlement or solution of all disputes or conflicts of whatever nature or of whatever origin they may be, which may arise among them, shall never be sought except by pacific means," declares that the aforementioned principles and provisions have a binding nature until the Council takes final steps to resolve the dispute before it. It also declares that the Members of the League cannot recognize any status, treaty, or agreement obtained by violating the League of Nations Covenant and the Paris Pact. Section 2: The General Assembly solemnly declares that any attempt by either party to seek a resolution to the Sino-Japanese dispute through the use of force is contrary to the spirit of the Covenant. Recalling the resolutions passed by the Council on September 30th and December 10th, 1931, which were agreed to by both parties, and recalling the resolution passed by the General Assembly itself on March 4th, 1932, regarding a genuine ceasefire and the withdrawal of Japanese troops, which was agreed to by both parties, it is aware that countries with special interests in the Shanghai International Settlement are fully cooperating for this purpose to maintain the security of the withdrawal area.

It is decided to organize a committee of nineteen members, with the President of the General Assembly as the Chairman of the committee, together with members of the Council other than the parties concerned, and representatives of other member states elected by secret ballot.

<h3>Xi Qia's Peace Negotiations with Ding Chao Fail</h3>
<p>(Harbin) On the 16th, the Japanese Xiang Kou Detachment and the National Salvation Army's Liu Zhenbang unit engaged in a fierce battle in Ningguta, resulting in heavy casualties on both sides.

<h3>Zhang Zhizhong Expresses Respect for League of Nations Treaties</h3>

The fact that it is unwilling to quickly abandon its policy of military aggression has long been anticipated by our government. Since our country is one of the signatory countries of the League of Nations Covenant, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Nine-Power Treaty, it should fulfill its responsibility to safeguard the above treaties. If the Japanese army dares to disregard the above treaties and the repeated resolutions of the League of Nations and attacks our army again, this army will follow the orders of Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek and the repeated declarations of the generals of the Nineteenth Route Army to resist to the end, even with the last soldier, to fulfill the responsibilities of a soldier. The government is confident that it has a firm grasp on long-term resistance, and will not allow Japan's ambitions to succeed. After speaking, he departed. (Special Dispatch, 19th)</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Japanese Warships Run Rampant on the Yangtze River</h3>
<p>Several Small Boats Sunk at Guazhou</p>
<p>Four Japanese Warships Sail Side by Side on the Zhenjiang River</p>
<p>Japanese warships are running rampant on the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, with a total of 34 ships, patrolling and mooring in sections. At night, they often use searchlights to shine around indiscriminately. Yesterday (16th) at 7:00 AM, three Japanese warships came from the upper reaches, less than twenty lengths apart from each other, and sailed eastward at full speed. The waves were as high as small mountains, and countless small boats along the river were overturned. When these warships passed Guazhou, three boats going downstream, one fishing boat, one firewood boat, were immediately sunk by the waves. A total of thirty or forty people fell into the water, and the water police dispatched boats to rescue a dozen people. The rest are missing. The automobile ferry terminal at Liugang in Jiangbei was also destroyed and could not be used. The Wangyue destroyer, which was originally stationed on the Zhenjiang River, also set sail and went east together (currently only one ship, the 熱海, is stationed in Zhenjiang), with four ships sailing side by side, the white waves turning the sky. It is unknown how many lives downstream merchant ships lost. The drowned corpses at Guazhou have been brought to Zhenjiang by Inspector Shi Gongze to collect coffins from the rescue bureau for burial. It has been found that Japanese warships are running rampant on our seas, causing losses to our people's lives and property. It is hoped that the government will quickly find a way to stop them.

<h3>Japanese Air Defense Movement is Frenzied</h3>
<p>Osaka Holds Joint Conference</p>
<p>Discussing Air Defense Equipment Funding</p>
<p>The Osaka Asahi Shimbun reports that, due to the Manchurian and Shanghai incidents, the voice for air defense movements in Osaka is quite enthusiastic. The Osaka Prefectural City Chamber of Commerce and Industry, in coordination with citizens, is urgently seeking to complete Osaka's air defense equipment. A joint conference was held at the Osaka Prefectural Office on the 11th to discuss funding and various specific plans. When the army holds a special grand exercise centered on Osaka this autumn, concrete decisions will be made. Various opinions advocate installing four sets of 7.5-inch anti-aircraft guns, searchlights, sound detectors, and observation devices, with each set estimated to cost 150,000 Japanese yen, totaling 600,000 yen. It has not yet been decided whether to modify 10-inch anti-aircraft guns, so a large sum of 1.5 million yen will be raised for large-scale air defense equipment. On the one hand, citizens will be trained to prepare for defense. Every summer, a lighting control exercise will be held once.</p>
<h3>Japanese Financial World is in Crisis</h3>
<p>Issuing 500 Million in Public Bonds This Year</p>
<p>Financing for Long-Term Projects All Stopped</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Manchurian Incident Was Very Costly</p>
<p>The Tokyo Jiji Shinpo reports that Finance Minister Takahashi, due to the impact of the Manchurian and Shanghai incidents on the financial world and financial blockage, is urgently seeking to establish financial and economic policies to ease the financial world. He plans to establish a financial investigation committee to examine the actual situation and handle the aftermath. However, the compilation of the budget for the 7th year has not yet been completed, so the Budget Bureau of the Ministry of Finance is urging the provinces to hurry up and compile the total amount of additional amounts and temporary expenditures in order to submit them for discussion at the provisional parliament. It is reported that the Ministry of Internal Affairs is adding about 80 million yuan, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry 50 million yuan, and the Ministry of Finance 10 million yuan, totaling about 150 million yuan. In addition, the current cabinet is advocating a five-year plan and wants to implement various projects, so the budget for the 7th year will be temporarily increased, I am afraid it will exceed 200 million yuan. The Ministry of Finance, which has no financial resources, has no other choice but to issue public bonds. The military public bonds for the coming year, which have already been consulted and decided by the Privy Council, total 70 million yuan, public bonds to fill the deficit of the 6th year 20 million yuan, public bonds to fill the deficit of the 7th year about 150 million yuan, retirement bonus public bonds about 15 million yuan, various special accounting public bonds about 150 million yuan, relief public bonds about 30 million yuan, other decided to issue about 455 million yuan, so the total must issue 500 million yuan of public bonds. Moreover, due to the relationship with the provinces, in order to cope with the financial resources for temporary expenses, it is also necessary to issue 200 million yuan. Such a huge amount of public bonds, I am afraid it cannot be held in fact. Therefore, except for the inevitable expenses to maintain the face of the government, all the rest are rejected.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Hochi Shimbun reports that, due to the impact of financial迫, various aspects are currently suffering major blows. Among them, the most notable is business financing, that is, the refinancing of corporate bonds is no longer possible. Banks also have restrictions on the turnover of short-term capital, so the financial circulation of long-term projects is completely closed. In addition, local finance has undergone drastic changes, and it is extremely difficult to repay maturing loans, so business operators have no choice but to temporarily borrow to maintain the status quo. However, it is difficult to predict the future trend of financial development, causing great obstacles to the industrial world. The Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun reports that, regarding the Shanghai Manchurian incident expenses and the Shanghai incident additional budget expenses, at the cabinet meeting on the 17th, the following amounts were decided to be submitted to the provisional parliament: 6.568 million for the army in the 6th year, 1.01 million for the navy, 1.44 million for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the 7th year, 30.97 million for the army, and 27.108 million for the navy, totaling 67.09 million yuan, plus an additional 354,000 yuan for the special accounting Kwantung Hall expenses, totaling 67.45 million yuan.</p>

<h3>20th Anniversary Business Report of the Bank of China</h3>
<p>Political Stability and Social Prosperity are the Foundation for Affairs</p>
<p>The Bank of China is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year. Not only has the degree of progress not been able to keep up with the 美 Bank, but it often feels like taking five steps forward and ten steps back, and even the hardship of wanting to move forward but stopping. Recalling the 20-year history of the Bank of China, although the people in charge have always been conscientious and尽战 in their work, the achievements reported each year are really not worthy of the expectations of shareholders and society. Besides our shame and guilt, we must have a word to tell our shareholders and society: The position of the bank in the country and society is no different from one of the many machines in the factory. The placement of the machine must be on solid ground before it can turn smoothly. The prosperity or number of banks depends on the ability and credit of the people in charge, but its most important foundation is actually in political stability and social prosperity. Today, in the past, when it comes to politics, there are years of civil war, four points and five, and when it comes to society, disasters are frequent, and bandits are everywhere. If politics is not stable for a year, and society is on the verge of bankruptcy, and it is said that banks can grow and prosper on their own, what is the difference between installing machines on sand and hoping that they will never stop? In the first half of the 20th year of the Republic of China, although there was a dispute between the Ning and Guangdong factions, fortunately, the suppression of bandits in Jiangxi and Hubei was successful, and the northern provinces were hot during the year, and it was said that the second half of the year might be able to survive. Unexpectedly, in June, the Yangtze River provinces suffered a major flood, spreading to more than ten provinces. In September, the Northeast Incident occurred, and the anti-Japanese movement spread across the country. These two incidents had a major impact on the social economy. All industries stagnated, businesses went bankrupt, the money market was extremely tight, and securities fell sharply. Therefore, the various plans that the bank had been working on for the past year to develop domestic and foreign trade and assist agriculture and industry were frustrated, and the accumulated strength must be used for investment. Therefore, during this year, although the bank's work has not been without a few noteworthy services to the society, it has not been able to report to the shareholders on the results of the annual profit. In general, the internal and external troubles are caused by poor politics. The general society is affected by poor politics. How can our Bank of China be spared?</p>
<p>Balance Sheet and Profit</p>
<h3>Explanation of Profit and Loss Statement Revision</h3>
<p>Simplification and Internationalization of the Balance Sheet</p>
<p>The preparation of this bank's balance sheet has traditionally been somewhat formalistic. The order of items has been rather vague and generalized. The purpose of a balance sheet is to report to shareholders, in an extremely simple form, the hundreds of thousands or millions of operating revenues and expenditures over a period of time, and at the same time, to be publicly disclosed to society with extremely clear content. Furthermore, it should be comparable with those of other foreign banks to promote an internationalized accounting system. Therefore, the determination of its items and the arrangement of their order should not only enable shareholders and customers to understand at a glance the actual situation of a bank's assets, liabilities, and profits and losses, but also allow readers to compare and view it side-by-side with the item order of other international banks, for ease of reference and comparison. In this way, the substance of a bank's content, and the strengths and weaknesses of its staff's abilities, can be fully subjected to the public judgment of shareholders and customers, and achieve the effect of competitive progress. The profit and loss statement is intended to display the achievements of operations, ensuring clarity and ease of understanding, so it has also been slightly revised. Now, the revised points of this year's balance sheet and profit and loss statement are briefly described separately below:</p>
<p>A. Balance Sheet</p>
<p>(1) "Unpaid Capital Stock" was previously listed as an asset item. Now, in accordance with common practice, a "Paid-up Capital Stock" item has been added to the liability category to fill in the actual amount of paid-up capital.</p>
<p>(2) "Due from Banks" and "Loans to Banks" were previously included under "Current Deposits" and "Current Loans." However, because of their nature, they are now listed separately as "Due from Banks" and "Loans to Banks" items, to distinguish them from other deposits and loans.</p>
<p>(3) Discounted bills and purchased term bills differ in nature from other loans and should be listed under a separate item.</p>
<p>(4) Accrued income and accrued expenses are not deposits or loans, but have historically been included under "Current Deposits" and "Current Loans." Uncollected and collected on behalf were also historically included under deposits and loans, which is not entirely reasonable. Now, counter items such as "Accrued Contracts," "Accrued Payments," "Uncollected Items," and "Items Collected on Behalf" have been added, listed separately on both the asset and liability sides.</p>
<p>(5) "Guarantees" and "Accepted Bills" represent the liabilities of customers and the guarantees of the bank. Now, new items have been added to clarify this.</p>
<p>(6) The order of arrangement of the various items on both the asset and liability sides is determined with reference to international practice. On the asset side, the ease of realization of various assets is prioritized, with those easily realized placed first. On the liability side, in addition to capital surplus and retained earnings being placed first as usual, other liabilities are prioritized based on the activity and stability of their nature, with more active ones placed first. This facilitates easy judgment through comparison of both sides.</p>
<p>B. Profit and Loss Statement</p>
<p>(1) "Exchange Gains and Losses" are merged with "Interest," in accordance with the common practice of European countries.</p>
<p>(2) The content of the original "Miscellaneous Gains and Losses" item included items such as handling fees, so it is now changed to "Handling Fees and Others." In accordance with international practice, the "Gains and Losses on Securities" item is merged into this item.</p>
<p>(3) Remittances are one of the bank's important businesses, so a separate "Remittance Income" item is established.</p>
<p>(4) The bank issues a relatively large number of banknotes, and the annual amortization of banknote manufacturing costs is not small, so a separate item is established.</p>
<p>(5) A portion of the banknote manufacturing costs in the original "Various Amortizations" item has already been separated and established as a separate item, so the remaining portion of depreciation of business properties and equipment is also established as a separate item to match the name with the reality, and the original "Various Amortizations" item is abolished.</p>
<h3>Bank of China's Operations in the 20th Year of the Republic of China</h3>
<p>Deposits Increased by More Than 16,000 Accounts</p>
<p>Loans Increasingly Focused on Industry and Commerce</p>
<p>Securities Valued at Verifiable Prices</p>
<p>Supporting National Goods Industry</p>
<p>Striving for Overseas Chinese Service</p>
<p>Facilitating Domestic Remittances</p>
<p>The business conditions in various locations during the first half of the 20th year of the Republic of China have all shown progress, thanks to the temporary stability of the situation and the active flow of market funds, which has increased the bank's business accordingly. The various reforms implemented by the bank since the 19th year have gradually shown positive effects in society. Without the Yangtze River floods and the Eastern Province Incident in the second half of the year, the bank's operations in the 20th year of the Republic of China would have made even greater progress. Although there were these two setbacks in the second half of the year, the bank was still able to stand firm and was not affected by the storms. This is due to the credit and accumulated strength generated by the consistent principles embraced by the bank over the past 20 years, which have proven effective in difficult times. This is something to be reported to the shareholders, and is detailed as follows:</p>
<p>Assets and Liabilities</p>
<p>Deposits</p>
<p>A. Total Deposits (1) Current Deposits: The balance of current deposits in the 19th year was 465,731,257.90 yuan. The balance of current and demand deposits in the 20th year was 243,560,184.05 yuan. Superficially, it appears to be a decrease of 222,171,073.85 yuan. This is because the balance sheet for this year has been revised, and interbank transactions and other items with fixed characteristics have been excluded, resulting in the aforementioned decrease. If the balance of current deposits in the 19th year is summarized according to the deposit categories of this year, it should be 240,559,128.01 yuan. In reality, there was an increase of 3,001,056.04 yuan. (2) Fixed Deposits: 69,721,895.98 yuan in the 19th year, and 174,242,663.61 yuan in the 20th year. Also due to different item classifications, if the balance of fixed deposits in the 19th year is classified according to this year's categories, it should be 160,109,266.60 yuan. In reality, there was only an increase of 14,133,397.01 yuan. (3) Due from Banks: In last year's balance sheet, it was included in general deposits, with a balance of 40,563,958.84 yuan. In the 20th year, it was 44,853,519.32 yuan, an actual increase of 4,289,560.48 yuan. The total increase for the above three deposit items is 21,424,043.53 yuan.</p>
<p>B. Number of Depositors The increase in the number of depositors in the 20th year is as follows: Number of accounts in the 19th year Number of accounts in the 20th year Increase Fixed Deposits 31,256 accounts 38,442 accounts 7,186 accounts Current and Demand Deposits 44,871 accounts 54,604 accounts 9,733 accounts C. Nature of Deposits The percentage comparison of the nature of deposits according to the type of depositor in the 20th year compared to the 19th year is as follows:</p>
<p>Nature 19th year 20th year</p>
<p>Government Deposits 9.89 8.25</p>
<p>Industrial and Commercial Deposits 54.23 33.29</p>
<p>Group and Personal</p>
<p>Deposits 35.88 58.46</p>
<p>The increase in the number of depositors and group and personal deposits is sufficient to prove the bank's credit and the effectiveness of its public service. The decrease in industrial and commercial deposits is evidence of the market decline and lack of industrial and commercial funds in the second half of the year.</p>
<p>Loans</p>
<p>(A) Total Loans (1) Current Loans and Overdrafts: The balance in the 19th year was 362,533,537.30 yuan, and in the 20th year it was 110,696,451.44 yuan. This is due to changes in the item classification, with fixed-nature loans being reclassified as fixed-term and discounted bills and interbank transactions being listed as separate items. The actual balance for the 19th year should have been 77,350,500.37 yuan, an increase of 33,345,951.07 yuan compared to the 20th year. (2) Fixed-Term Loans: The balance in the 19th year was 110,350,044.49 yuan, which did not include all fixed-nature loans. The actual balance should have been 217,864,296.44 yuan. The balance in the 20th year was 188,235,521.76 yuan, a decrease of 29,628,774.68 yuan. (3) Due from Banks: In the 19th year, it was included in general loans, with a balance of 54,361,376.57 yuan. In the 20th year, it was 49,915,599.04 yuan, a decrease of 4,445,777.53 yuan. (4) Discounted Bills and Purchased Term Bills (including import and export bills): 27,621,919.80 yuan in the 19th year, and 35,006,636.42 yuan in the 20th year, an increase of 7,384,716.62 yuan. Considering all the above loan items, the combined total was 377,198,093.18 yuan in the 19th year and 383,854,208.66 yuan in the 20th year, an increase of 6,656,115.48 yuan.</p>
<p>(B) Nature of Loans The percentage comparison of the nature of loans to various borrowers in the 19th and 20th years is as follows:</p>
<p>19th Year: Commerce 20.14, Industry 6.57, Public Utilities 7.94, Banks 16.92, Groups/Organizations 1.94, Individuals 48.93, Other 3.56</p>
<p>20th Year: Commerce 21.79, Industry 10.14, Public Utilities 1.08, Banks 15.02, Groups/Organizations 1.37, Individuals 47.19, Other 3.41</p>
<p>Based on the above situation, the following trends in the bank's business policy can be observed: (1) Increasing loans to industry and commerce to assist the development of productive enterprises. (2) Reducing loans to government agencies and individuals to expand the bank's public service effectiveness. (3) Reducing fixed-term loans and increasing current loans to increase the efficiency of capital turnover. (C) Securities The balance of securities in the 19th year was 65,085,113.84 yuan, and in the 20th year it was 72,024,497.88 yuan, an increase of 6,939,384.04 yuan. In the 20th year, the bank's securities investment accounted for only 8.5% of the total assets. The prices of Chinese and foreign securities plummeted this year. Although their final value will be restored as the market recovers and the principal and interest are repaid, the bank, in order to ensure the true value of assets, has to value them at market prices. Fortunately, the settlement price of the government bonds in the 19th year was very low, and the foreign debts were calculated at 80% of the market price. In addition, the pound sterling was discounted at 80% of the market rate, which was about the same as the market price this year. Although the domestic debts were calculated at 80% of the market price in the 19th year, the price drop at the end of the 20th year had exceeded 20%. The difference has been offset by the securities profit and loss fund withdrawn from various banks. The price shown on the books is the actual market price at the end of the year. At the same time, due to the excessive issuance of domestic debts in the 20th year and the unstable market price, the proportion of gold bonds was increased compared to silver bonds in order to stabilize the asset price. The percentage of gold and silver government bonds is listed below:</p>
<p>20th Year 19th Year</p>
<p>Silver Coin Bonds 55.3 62.5</p>
<p>Gold Coin Bonds 44.7 37.5</p>
<p>3 Business Operations</p>
<p>Assisting national industry and developing industry is also one of the bank's public service efforts. In the 20th year, loans to industry totaled 33,674,925 yuan, of which 31,200,7654 yuan was for loans to national goods factories. Among the loans to national goods factories by the Shanghai branch and branches in other cities, the Shanghai branch accounted for 89% of the industrial loans, and the branches in other cities accounted for 94% of the industrial loans. There are many types of national goods industries. The following shows the percentage of the bank's loan amount in the total amount of working capital used in the industry: (1) Cotton mills 47.9, Silk weaving mills 22.9 (2) Flour mills 22, Dyeing factories 34.5 (3) Silk mills 11.6, Oil mills 59.</p>
<p>B. Reform of Remittance Procedures: The bank's total remittance amount for the 19th year was 57,551,8375 yuan. It increased to 82,685,6294 yuan in the 20th year, an increase of 25,133,7919 yuan, a real increase of 44%. The progress in remittance in the 20th year can be attributed to the bank's efforts to facilitate remittance procedures and reduce remittance fees, which is sufficient to increase the flow of funds and assist the development of commerce, and is also closely related to the livelihood of the people.</p>
<p>C. Concern for Serving Overseas Chinese: Overseas Chinese remittances are an element that constitutes the economic balance of China, and considering the hard work and struggle of overseas Chinese to help the motherland, banks should consider how to facilitate remittance procedures for overseas Chinese, how to ensure the safety of deposits and investments for overseas Chinese, and how to make overseas Chinese aware that there are financial institutions in the motherland that care about and serve them. This is the inherent duty of our Bank of China. Therefore, agency institutions were added in the United States, the Dutch East Indies, and Singapore, and were entrusted to collect remittances from overseas Chinese. The drafts stated that the Bank of China would pay. Special receptionists were appointed in Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Shantou, Xiamen, and Shanghai to ensure convenient collection of funds and reduced remittance fees. For overseas Chinese returning to China, we sincerely answered and handled any inquiries and entrustments. Although it has only been handled for half a year, the results have been significant. Because the bank has established management offices in the United Kingdom and Japan, the overseas Chinese feel more convenient. We hope that the world market will recover soon and the livelihood of overseas Chinese will become more prosperous, so that the bank's ambition to serve overseas Chinese can be fully realized. D. Design of the Investigation Work: Since the reorganization into an international remittance bank in the 17th year, the contact with industry and commerce has become closer. The need for a thorough understanding of the credit and industrial status of merchants is increasing day by day. Therefore, although the establishment of investigation work has not been widely noticed in China, it has actually become an urgent matter. This year, industrial groups from various countries came to China for inspection, and foreign merchants sent representatives to China for consultation. The bank diligently handled the commissioning of investigations by Chinese and foreign manufacturers of export merchants, as well as the supply and demand of goods. Although extremely busy, this kind of work is very helpful. We hope that Chinese and foreign merchants will continue to commission, so that Chinese and foreign trade can be promoted, and international economy can be mediated closer.</p>
<p>E. Helping to Stabilize the Market: After the floods, securities prices plummeted, financial institutions tightened, and the Northeast Incident occurred. The financial outline was partially broken. In addition, foreign troubles were imminent, and everyone was hoarding cash. The weak silver shops and money houses were unable to withstand the situation and were stranded and squeezed one after another. The interbank lending rates continued to rise higher and higher. People were suspicious that a financial storm was inevitable. In view of the seriousness of the situation, the bank tried its best to tighten loans and maintain its strength on the one hand, and on the other hand, it released interbank loans to ease the market. Fortunately, no cracks were seen in the market throughout the year, which is fortunate.</p>
<h3>Three Profits and Losses</h3>
<p>The net profit for the 20th year was 1,837,427.44. After deducting 1/10 according to regulations, that is, 183,742.74, as public reserve, the regular interest of 7% was distributed to official and commercial shares, totaling 1,729,819.00, which was insufficient by 76,134.30 yuan, which was supplemented from the carryover from last year.</p>
<p>The bank's various business operations showed slight progress in the 20th year. It was originally expected that various reserves could not only be further enriched, but also that the surplus could be increased. Unfortunately, due to the sharp decline in market conditions in the second half of the year, the expectations of the office staff were counterproductive, which is a pity. Fortunately, all assets were able to be valued fairly, and the shareholders' official profits were maintained, and the business achievements were also beneficial to the society, which is something that can be reported to the shareholders and is also something that the shareholders will be happy to hear.</p>
<h3>Economic and Political Changes at Home and Abroad in the 20th Year and the Gains and Losses of the National Economy</h3>
<p>China Suffered a Loss of 300 Million Yuan Due to Foreign Influence</p>
<p>Suffered a Loss of 1 Billion Yuan Due to Domestic Influence</p>
<p>The impact of domestic and foreign events in the 20th year can be described as unprecedented. Abroad, the market declined to its extreme, overproduction and unemployment increased sharply, and the financial panic was in a precarious state. Although governments were busy with relief, the fire eventually spread, and the more they tried to save, the more intense it became, so that the credit between countries and between people and financial institutions was fundamentally shaken. Withdrawals and cash withdrawals could not be stopped. In the end, Germany announced the suspension of reparations payments, private debts were postponed by contract, and the United Kingdom formed a coalition cabinet government to severely reduce the budget and suspend the gold standard. Domestically, the floods occurred in May, with the affected area reaching more than 1.5 million square miles, and the banditry spread and could not be stopped. On September 18, the Japanese army invaded and seized the three northeastern provinces of China's ruling power, and the four provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe, which are rich in resources and ranked first in the country, were shaken. As a result, the whole country rose up against Japan, and the Sino-Japanese trade, which was the largest import and export country every year, plummeted suddenly. All of these directly and indirectly affected the national economy, and had a significant impact on the increase and decrease of national wealth. This will be discussed separately below.</p>
<p>A. The Phenomenon of the World Economic Panic. In the 20th year of the Republic of China, the global economic situation not only did not show any signs of improvement after the failure of last year, but also deteriorated further. 1. The number of unemployed people increased sharply. Not to mention in the United Kingdom and Germany, even the United States increased to 10 million people, and France increased to 540,000 people. 2. Prices fell. The price index in the United Kingdom fell from 77.8% in 1903 to 64.9% ("1927 as 100"). The United States fell from 87.1% in 1930 to 71.6% ("1926 as 100"). 3. Bank failures swept the globe. Two of Germany's five largest banks, the D-word banks, successively suspended payments and merged. A major bank in France also nearly went out of business. A total of 2,342 banks closed in the United States, with total deposits amounting to US$20,008,729,000. 4. Agricultural products were oversupplied. The United States had a surplus of approximately 14.5 million bales of cotton, 31.5 million bushels of wheat, Canada had 16.9 million bushels of wheat, Australia had a surplus of 95 million bushels of wheat, Argentina had a surplus of approximately 13 million bushels of wheat, and Japan had a surplus of 156,000 bales of raw silk.</p>
<p>5. The decrease in exports. According to common sense, the depreciation of the silver and the fall in prices should increase exports. However, due to the poor world market and the decrease in demand, China could not enjoy the slightest benefit. Exports last year not only did not increase, but also decreased by 0.08%, a decrease of 7 million customs taels.</p>
<p>6. The increase in imports. The depreciation of silver should have curbed imports. However, due to the global production surplus and the drop in prices, prices tended to be low, such as cotton, wheat, rice, and tobacco leaves. The import prices were even lower than the prices of local products. As a result, factories competed to import foreign goods. Therefore, the total value of the above four types of products imported in the 20th year of the Republic of China was approximately 37,268,000 customs taels, which was more than 63 million customs taels more than in the 19th year, equivalent to approximately 94.5 million yuan. At least three-quarters of this increase, approximately 70 million yuan, was due to the impact of world prices.</p>
<p>D. The decrease in overseas Chinese remittances. Overseas Chinese remittances are a major component of China's invisible export trade, which is used to offset the huge trade deficit every year. The increase or decrease of remittances has a great impact on the national loan and borrowing. However, since the collapse of the world market, the silk factories and factories in various parts of Nanyang have had many unemployed people. As a result, the British and Dutch governments have tried to limit the entry of overseas Chinese. For example, when Singapore first enacted laws to limit the entry of overseas Chinese, the number of entrants was reduced by 30% compared to before. When it was revised later, it was reduced by another 15%. The Dutch East Indies islands originally stipulated that a head tax of 30 Dutch guilders would be collected for each overseas Chinese entrant, which was later increased to 150 Dutch guilders, so that fewer and fewer overseas Chinese moved to Nanyang, and more and more returned home. Although the exact number of remittances from overseas Chinese last year cannot be obtained, it is estimated that approximately 40 million yuan was remitted to Hong Kong, approximately 20 million yuan to Guangzhou, approximately 38 million yuan to Shantou, 52 million yuan to Xiamen, and approximately 34 million yuan to Shanghai and other places, totaling approximately 189 million yuan, not exceeding 200 million yuan, which is at least 50 million yuan less than in the 19th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>E. Losses on Gold Investments: In recent years, financial institutions and those with assets in China have found it unsuitable to invest in stable assets due to the excessive fluctuations in the price of silver, so many have purchased and stored foreign currencies and invested in foreign currency bonds, mostly in British pounds. Since the British pound stopped cash payments, the price has fallen by about 30%. The gold investment on the Chinese side, calculated at 10 million pounds, although it is expected to recover soon, is estimated to have suffered a loss of 23 million taels based on current exchange rates and bond market prices. In addition, the property of overseas Chinese abroad, if calculated in silver, will suffer even greater losses.</p>
<p>The above are all changes in the foreign economy that have affected China. The domestic factors are nothing more than the three major factors: floods, bandits, and the Eastern Province Incident.</p>
<p>A. The Damage of the Flood. The magnitude of last year's floods was unprecedented in 60 years. The area covered more than 20 provinces, and the number of victims reached tens of millions. The worst were the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, Henan, and Shandong. The disaster situation investigated by the bank is as follows:</p>
<p>Province, Affected Farmland, Affected Farmers, Amount of Loss, Mu, Household, Yuan</p>
<p>Hubei, 27,523,000, 2,125,000, 100,000,000</p>
<p>Anhui, 13,950,000, 2,155,000, 40,000,000</p>
<p>Jiangsu, 61,431,000, 3,627,000, 100,000,000</p>
<p>Hunan, 13,950,000, 1,100,000, 100,000,000</p>
<p>Henan, 34,695,000, 1,586,000, 60,000,000</p>
<p>Jiangxi, 14,248,000, 1,035,000, 10,000,000</p>
<p>Shandong, 30,135,000, 1,551,000, 10,000,000</p>
<p>Zhejiang, 15,736,000, 932,000, 30,000,000</p>
<p>Total, 311,668,000, 14,091,000, 450,000,000</p>
<p>According to the survey by the National Government Statistics Bureau, the flooded farmland in the eight affected provinces totaled 255 million mu, and the amount of rice production lost was 900 million catties, accounting for 24% of the national production. Millet and sorghum were 140 million catties, accounting for 29% of the national production. Calculating rice at 4 cents per catty, cotton at 40 cents per catty, and millet and sorghum at 3 cents per catty, the total loss is 45.7 million yuan. The number is not much different from the bank's investigation. This is only the tangible loss. In addition to the decline in physical health and social morality, the intangible losses cannot be quantified, and the impact on the future prosperity of our nation is significant.</p>
<p>B. The Damage of the Northeast Incident: After the Northeast Incident occurred on September 18, the four provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Rehe entered a state of war. All industries stagnated, and people were displaced. The local grain production could not be transported out, and businesses closed down one after another. The direct and indirect losses suffered by the residents of the Northeast are immeasurable. The goods imported into the Northeast from various provinces could not move forward. The debts owed by businesses in the Northeast to various ports in the mainland could not be repaid on time, which caused great damage to the finances of Tianjin and Shanghai. Secondly, various places successively sealed up Japanese goods. These Japanese goods were either in the hands of Chinese merchants or pledged in various money shops. Although it is impossible to obtain an accurate number, it is generally not less than 100 million yuan. The stagnation of this 100 million yuan of funds is also due to the Northeast Incident. In addition to the political disputes, popular panic, financial tightening, and business decline caused by the incident, the tangible and intangible damages are even more immeasurable.</p>
<p>C. The Damage of Banditry: Banditry in Jiangxi Province has been going on for many years. In the 20th year of the Republic of China, it spread from Hunan to Hubei. At present, not only is two-thirds of Jiangxi Province a bandit area, but also more than a dozen counties in Hubei have been affected. The loss of these 20 million people, the reduction in production, and the 50 to 60 million yuan of bandit suppression funds spent annually total more than 200 million.</p>
<p>Summarizing various damages to make a final account of the Republic of China, the shocking number is enough to shock the world, but the basis for the occurrence of damages due to changes in domestic politics far exceeds changes in the foreign economy, which is the most tragic.</p>
<h3>International Trade in the 20th Year of the Republic</h3>
<p>Imports Exceed 500 Million Taels</p>
<p>Japan Recedes to Second Place</p>
<p>Silver Imports Decrease, Trade Concentrated in Shanghai</p>
<p>China's Purchasing Power in the Future</p>
<p>1.  Imports Exceed 540 Million Taels</p>
<p>The global economic downturn in the 20th year of the Republic was not only not alleviated compared to the 19th year, but intensified. The foreign trade of all countries decreased. Comparing the 20th year to the 19th year, the percentage decrease in import and export trade for various countries is as follows:</p>
<p>Imports　　　　Exports</p>
<p>United Kingdom　　　　-16.6　　　　-31.9</p>
<p>Japan　　　　　　　　-20.0　　　　-28.1</p>
<p>United States　　　　-31.8　　　　-36.9</p>
<p>Germany　　　　　　　-35.3　　　　-18.8</p>
<p>France　　　　　　　　-19.4　　　　-29.0</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>Netherlands　　　　　-33.0　　　　-8.3</p>
<p>Switzerland　　　　　-12.2　　　　-23.5</p>
<p>Canada　　　　　　　-37.7　　　　-32.7</p>
<p>As for Russia, the phenomenon of worker strikes, business and industrial stagnation did not exist, so it cannot be compared with other countries. However, it was also inevitably affected by the global economic downturn. Considering Russia's Five-Year Plan, on the one hand, it sought to balance imports and exports, and on the other hand, it aimed to increase the quantity of exports. In the three years prior, the export value of grains and timber alone increased two to threefold compared to the past. The 20th year of the Republic was the fourth year of its five-year plan. According to the original plan, the total export volume for this year should have increased by onefold compared to the first year. However, the total export value for the first eight months of this year was 20% less than the previous year. At the same time, the import surplus reached 216,310,000 rubles, equivalent to 21 million pounds sterling.</p>
<p>Conversely, considering China's import and export trade in the 20th year of the Republic, imports increased by 8.1%, while exports only decreased by 0.8%. The net import amount was 1,427,574,000 taels (the following Customs tael figures are similar), an increase of 117,819,000 taels compared to the 1,309,755,000 taels in the 19th year. The net export amount was 887,450,000 taels, a decrease of 7,393,000 taels compared to the 894,843,000 taels in the 19th year. The total import and export trade volume (excluding gold, silver, and currency) was 2,315,024,000 taels, a total decrease of 69,030,000 taels compared to the 2,204,599,000 taels in the 19th year.</p>
<p>The most noteworthy point is that the excess of imports over exports in the 20th year of the Republic increased by 30% compared to the 19th year, reaching a value of more than 540 million taels, equivalent to more than 810 million yuan. In last year's report, this publication, due to the excess of imports over exports reaching more than 414.9 million taels that year, considered it unprecedented in China's trade history. Unexpectedly, this year it skyrocketed, increasing by another 125 million taels. Since the opening of trade in China, it has often been in a position of import surplus. In the 63 years from 1868 to 1931, there were only six years of export surplus. Since 1877, export surpluses have hardly been seen again. Even during the European War, such as around the 8th year of the Republic, the amount of import surplus greatly decreased, but it resumed after the war. According to statistics from the 1st to the 20th year of the Republic, the total amount by which imports exceeded exports was more than 381.5 million taels, equivalent to 572.25 million yuan. In the import goods this year, agricultural products were still the majority, such as cotton, rice, wheat, wheat flour, and tobacco, with a total value of more than 384 million taels. Such situations must be loudly appealed to in each annual report. Informed individuals are certainly paying attention to this, but with such a major disease in the national economy, the government remains indifferent and takes no remedial measures. Therefore, it is necessary to reiterate this point repeatedly.</p>
<h3>2. The United States Ranks First in Imports, Japan Ranks First in Exports</h3>
<p>Among China's import trade, Japan has always held the first position in terms of quantity. This year, it receded to the second position. Since the occurrence of the Northeast Incident, all sectors of the country have been indignant, and the boycott of Japanese goods by merchants in various regions has been carried out vigorously. Since September, it has been decreasing step by step. In November, the value of goods shipped from Japan to China was only one-third of that in July.</p>

<p>December　　　10,091　　　　22,200　　　　19,903　　　　15,100</p>
<p>After the boycott of Japanese goods, the country turned to ordering cotton yarn, piece goods, and other basic raw materials from the United Kingdom and the United States. The United Kingdom suspended cash payments in gold pounds, and prices fell. The price of goods also fell, making them able to compete with Japan. As for India, because Indian cotton prices were more expensive than American cotton last year, imports decreased. The value of goods imported this year fell to 84 million taels, a decrease of 37% compared to the 19th year. Therefore, the United Kingdom advanced from fourth place to third place, the United States jumped to first place, India receded to fifth place, and German imports increased year by year, ranking fourth. The country of import and the value of the imported goods are shown below:</p>

<p>On the export side, since soybeans, miscellaneous grains from the Northeast, and cotton from Tianjin were mostly transported to Japan, and due to the drop in silver prices, the quantity of cotton yarn exported from China this year increased compared to last year. Therefore, Japan ranked first, followed by the United States, which mainly received raw silk, tung oil, and eggs. The United Kingdom, Russia, the Netherlands, and France had similar figures to the previous year.</p>

<h3>3. Cotton and Cotton Goods are the Most Imported Goods, Soybeans are the Most Exported Goods</h3>
<p>Among the imports in the 20th year, cotton was the largest, followed by cotton goods. Other important imported items included chemical products, metals and minerals, wheat, rice, sugar, oil, tobacco, paper, building materials, and various types of machinery. Among the exported domestic goods, soybeans ranked first, followed by raw silk. Cotton, eggs and egg products, tea, minerals, cotton yarn, silk fabrics, plant oil, peanuts, sesame, etc., were all important export items. Among the imported goods, the most significant increase compared to the 19th year was in cotton, with an increase of 33,721,000 taels. Wheat increased by 68,901,000 taels, tobacco increased by 22,150,000 taels, and wool fabrics increased by 24,068,000 taels. In addition, building materials, chemical products, paper, rayon, and machinery all increased. The goods that decreased were rice, with a decrease of 60,791,000 taels, and cotton fabrics, with a decrease of 20,801,000 taels. In addition, flour, seafood, metals, and minerals all slightly decreased. Among the exported goods, the most significant increase compared to the 19th year was in cotton, with an increase of 2,145,000 taels, cotton fabrics increased by 40,775,000 taels, cotton yarn increased by 18,739,000 taels, and soybeans increased by 22,102,000 taels. In addition, tea, silk fabrics, plant oil, and chemical products all increased. Among the goods that decreased, eggs decreased by 13,723,000 taels, and raw silk decreased by 8,498,000 taels, which were more significant, while there were no major differences in the rest.</p>
<h3>4. Gold and Silver Inflow and Outflow and Silver Prices</h3>
<p>Silver imports in the 20th year decreased significantly, with net imports of only 45.1 million taels. The import and export amounts for the past three years are as follows:</p>
<p>18th Year: 105.8 million Customs Taels</p>
<p>19th Year: 67 million Customs Taels</p>
<p>20th Year: 45.1 million Customs Taels</p>
<p>The detailed import and export figures are as follows:</p>
<p>Location　　　　Imports (Customs Taels)　　　　Exports</p>
<p>British India, Burma, Ceylon　　　　858,689　　　　2,658,446</p>
<p>Germany　　　　6,250　　　　3,554</p>
<p>United Kingdom　　　　9,274,554</p>
<p>Hong Kong　　　　37,777,482　　　　15,407,236</p>

<p>Japan, Korea　　　　1,937,625　　　　2,935,474</p>
<p>Dutch East Indies　　　　196,155</p>
<p>Singapore　　　　1,092,932</p>
<p>United States　　　　18,557,088　　　　1,092,932</p>
<p>Other　　　　1,607,118　　　　4,148,789</p>
<p>Total　　　　71,570,294　　　　26,444,764</p>
<p>The declared export of raw gold in the 20th year was 19,765,456 Customs Taels. Smuggled exports were approximately 15 million Customs Taels, accounting for about three-quarters of the import value of raw silver. Since the ban on gold exports, a price difference has emerged. This ban should be lifted as soon as possible. The output of raw silver in the 20th year was 196,100,000 ounces, a decrease of 50,700,000 ounces compared to the 19th year. Other sources were 59,500,000 ounces, a decrease of 12,000,000 ounces compared to the 19th year. The total supply was 255,600,000 ounces, a decrease of 62,700,000 ounces compared to the 19th year. On the consumption side, China used 59,000,000 ounces, India used 57,000,000 ounces, other countries used 30,600,000 ounces for coinage, and 55,000,000 ounces were used for art and crafts. The surplus was 53,000,000 ounces. Thus, although the supply of silver in the 20th year decreased by 62,700,000 ounces, consumption decreased by 64,000,000 ounces in China and 37,500,000 ounces in India, while only art and crafts increased by 2,000,000 ounces and coinage increased by 2,500,000 ounces. Therefore, the surplus increased by 30,300,000 ounces. The decrease in consumption far exceeded the decrease in production. The future of silver prices is difficult to stabilize. Although there was a rebound in the second half of the year, 20-30% was due to the fall in pound prices, and 70-80% was due to speculation, without any fundamental signs of stability. The International Chamber of Commerce resolved to convene a silver price conference, and economic and financial experts from various countries have put forward great theories on stabilizing silver prices, but no concrete plan has yet been seen. It is hoped that countries related to silver prices will continue to work hard to find a stabilization strategy, without neglecting the stability of silver prices due to the importance of general world problems.</p>
<h3>5. Comparison of Various Ports</h3>
<p>The total import and export value of each port in the 20th year, such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Kowloon, Jiaozhou, Hankou, Xiamen, Qinhuangdao, Jiangmen, and Yingkou, all increased compared to the 19th year. Dalian, Harbin, Andong, Yantai, Shantou, Fuzhou, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Mengzi, and Gongbei all decreased. The percentages occupied by each important port are as follows:</p>
<p>Percentage　　　　Percentage</p>
<p>Imports　　　　　　　　Exports</p>
<p>20th Year　　　　19th Year　　　　20th Year　　　　19th Year</p>
<p>Shanghai　　　　57.42　　　　51.18　　　　31.19　　　　34.94</p>
<p>Dalian　　　　7.92　　　　10.50　　　　23.17　　　　20.44</p>
<p>Tianjin　　　　7.53　　　　7.84　　　　10.02　　　　8.80</p>
<p>Guangzhou　　　　3.85　　　　3.85　　　　6.90　　　　6.75</p>
<p>Kowloon　　　　3.82　　　　2.67　　　　0.94　　　　1.96</p>
<p>Jiaozhou　　　　3.29　　　　3.52　　　　4.95　　　　4.73</p>
<p>Shantou　　　　2.28　　　　2.89　　　　1.56　　　　2.01</p>
<p>Hankou　　　　2.03　　　　2.01　　　　2.89　　　　2.08</p>
<p>Harbin　　　　1.08　　　　1.22　　　　5.14　　　　5.66</p>
<p>Andong　　　　0.97　　　　2.52　　　　3.16　　　　4.59</p>
<p>What is noteworthy in the table above is that the import value of Shanghai alone accounted for only 48.75% in the 18th year, increased to 51.18% in the 19th year, and further increased to 57.42% in the current year. The excess of imports over exports in Shanghai alone was more than 552 million taels, equivalent to the total import surplus of the country.</p>
<h3>6. How to Offset the Import Surplus Deficit in the Future</h3>
<p>For decades, the Chinese people have seen annual import surpluses without becoming impoverished and have regarded it as something that can be left to nature. In foreign countries, tariffs have long been increased, exchange controls have been implemented, or consumption has been restricted. However, in China, apart from slightly increasing tax rates to increase tax revenue, no remedial measures have been taken. However, the import surplus deficit must be offset in order to achieve balance, either by relying on intangible income or by relying on the inflow of foreign capital. China's inherent intangible income relies solely on remittances from overseas Chinese. However, due to the sluggishness of commerce, remittances have decreased this year. If the market is not easily restored in the short term and silver prices rise again, then remittances from overseas Chinese will likely decrease rather than increase. Furthermore, due to China's political instability, foreign capital is also not abundant, so investment in China is also not easy to increase. As domestic order is not stable, the missionary work of foreign churches and the travels of tourists will further decrease, so the inflow of foreign capital is also not reliable. This is evidenced by the significant decrease in silver imports this year, which were only more than 45 million taels in the 20th year, less than half of that in the 19th year. This is proof that there are fewer exports and more imports, a decrease in intangible income, and no offsets to exchange silver. How to balance China's international lending is still an issue that economic scholars have not been able to accurately determine. It can be boldly stated that the import surplus of more than 540 million taels in the 20th year, after offsetting more than 140 million taels with remittances from overseas Chinese and approximately 200 million taels from foreign investment and foreign capital inflows such as missionary work, military presence, and travel, the remaining deficit of 200 million taels is likely reliant on the lending and credit of importing foreign firms, manufacturers, and banks to fill the gap. If all conditions do not improve and lending and credit reach their limit, then there is no other way but to reduce imports. The people should know that today we have reached this point. If the government and the people do not consider reducing the purchase of foreign goods, increasing the export of domestic goods, or friendly countries cooperating to increase the purchase of Chinese goods to easily sell the goods they want to sell, then from today onwards, the purchasing power of the Chinese people will inevitably plummet, and the decline of trade will become irreversible.</p>
<h3>Agriculture and Industry in the 20th Year of the Republic</h3>
<p>The Yarn Industry Cannot Compete with Japan</p>
<p>The Foundation of National Industry is Not Solid</p>
<p>The Silk Industry Cannot Compete with Japan</p>
<p>Agricultural Products Import More Than 200 Million Yuan</p>
<p>1.  Industry</p>
<p>In recent years, China's domestic industries have begun to sprout and grow rapidly. The main one is the yarn industry, and the number of spindles is increasing day by day. However, compared with the industrial countries of the world, it is still far behind. What is particularly noteworthy is that Shanghai has become the center of Chinese industry, with approximately 2,000 factories, a total capital of approximately 300 million yuan, and a total of approximately 250,000 workers. This year, due to low raw material prices, reduced costs, and the boycott of Japanese goods, except for the silk industry, which suffered a sharp drop in market prices due to the influx of Japanese silk, all other industries saw a prosperous atmosphere in the first half of the year, making more profit than in the 19th year. Unexpectedly, the Yangtze River flood and the Northeast Incident occurred one after another, and sales plummeted. Therefore, the total profit for the year was not unexpectedly high. However, there are one or two points about Chinese industry that cannot be ignored, which are briefly stated below:</p>
<p>1.  Competition in the Yarn Industry: Among the industries run by the Chinese themselves, the yarn industry is the first, and the most intense competition between Chinese and Japanese industries is also in the yarn industry. According to our survey last year, the total number of spindles owned by Chinese yarn factories nationwide was 2,336,000, and the number of spindles in Japanese yarn factories in China was approximately 1,500,000. However, due to the strong capital, sophisticated technology, and complete organization of Japanese factories, even with such a fierce boycott this year and the shortening of working hours, the output of Japanese factories in Shanghai was greater than that of Chinese factories. Shanghai's Chinese factories produced 560,000 bales of yarn and 147,000 pieces of cloth, while Shanghai's Japanese factories produced 690,070 bales of yarn and 216,000 pieces of cloth. Counting the entire Chinese nation, Chinese factories produced a total of 1,458,000 bales of yarn and 357,000 pieces of cloth, while Japanese factories produced a total of 1,008,000 bales of yarn and 315,000 pieces of cloth. From this point of view, compared between Chinese and Japanese factories, the overall output of Japanese factories and cloth production are almost equal, and the yarn production is more than the production that should be obtained from the spindle ratio. Chinese factories increased by more than 60,000 spindles this year, while Japanese factories increased by more than 100,000 spindles.</p>
<p>Recently, with the increase in tariffs, the rise in gold prices, and the high price of imported fine cloth, yarn factories originally made profits from the production of fine yarn. Chinese factories should take</p>
<h3>Second Agricultural Affairs</h3>
<p>1.  Rice and Wheat: In the spring of the 20th year, there was excessive rainfall, and during the summer, rivers overflowed, causing significant damage to agricultural production. Rice production was reduced by approximately 20% to 30%, while wheat production decreased by about 10%. In the 20th year, the import of foreign rice exceeded the export of Chinese rice by 10,736,000 dan, amounting to 60,214,000 taels of silver (Customs taels). Wheat imports exceeded exports by 22,219,800 dan, amounting to over 81,700,000 taels of silver. Flour imports exceeded exports by over 4,790,000 dan, amounting to over 26,200,000 taels of silver. Comparing the total import volume with that of the 19th year, wheat increased by more than six times, rice decreased by 40%, and flour decreased by 18%. The total import value of these three items was over 186,400,000 taels, with a net import value of over 168,114,000 taels, accounting for approximately 13% of the total imports.</p>
<p>It is noted that among the total grain imports in the 20th year, 2,680,000 dan of wheat and 437,000 dan of flour were part of the 450,000 tons of American wheat and flour loaned to China for disaster relief. (It was stipulated that it be repaid in three years starting from 1934.) This amount could offset 9% of the total agricultural losses due to the disaster. However, due to inconvenient inland transportation, excessive costs, repeated handling, and significant concealed losses, and because prices were settled based on the shipping date, if wheat prices rose during transportation and the future price of gold increased, China would inevitably suffer significant losses. Therefore, whether it is economical to borrow food from foreign countries for disaster relief is truly questionable. In essence, due to the neglect of water conservancy on ordinary days and temporary patching up in times of emergency, coupled with a lack of effective measures, how can one say that the planning was not poor?</p>
<p>2.  Cotton: According to the statistical report of the China Cotton Industry Association on December 15th of the 20th year, the national cotton production was only 6,460,000 dan, a decrease of 2,340,000 dan compared to the 19th year. At the same time, the number of yarn spindles in yarn factories increased, and fine yarn raw materials required foreign cotton. Therefore, in the 20th year, over 4,584,400 dan of cotton was imported from countries like the United States and India, an increase of 31% compared to the 19th year, amounting to 165,987,000 Customs taels. The export of native cotton was over 1,106,000 dan, amounting to over 30,010,000 taels.</p>
<p>3.  Tea: In the 20th year, the production of black tea decreased by one-tenth compared to the 19th year, and green tea decreased by three-tenths. Due to the reduced production and rising market prices, coupled with the low silver price and high export prices, tea merchants experienced some profits. The export of tea amounted to 700,800 dan, amounting to 33,059,000 taels, an increase of approximately three-tenths compared to the 26,284,000 taels in the 19th year.</p>
<p>4.  Tobacco: Tobacco has gradually become one of the main agricultural products. In the 20th year, the Shandong tobacco harvest was approximately 55 million pounds. The quality of Henan tobacco was not as good as Shandong, but the quantity exceeded it, at approximately 60 million pounds. Due to excessive rainfall in Mentai Village, Anhui, both the quantity and quality were not as good as in the 19th year, with a harvest of only about 1.5 million pounds. However, due to the abundant harvest and very low prices of American tobacco, it sold well in China. Therefore, Chinese farmers were unable to sell at a good price. It is estimated that a total of 1,235,000 dan of tobacco was imported into China from the United States, an increase of over 300,000 dan compared to the 19th year, amounting to 49,216,300 taels.</p>
<p>5.  Vegetable Oil: Soybean oil, peanut oil, and tung oil are the main export commodities of our country's agricultural products. In the 20th year, soybean oil exports were approximately 1,500,000 dan, amounting to over 16,000,000 taels, a decrease of approximately two-tenths compared to the 19th year. Peanut oil exports were approximately 800,900 dan, amounting to over 12,540,000 taels, a decrease of approximately six-tenths compared to the 19th year. Tung oil exports were 800,900 dan, amounting to 18,880,000 taels, a decrease of approximately three-tenths compared to the 19th year.</p>
<p>China is a country based on agriculture, yet agricultural products are imported so heavily, and exports are decreasing day by day. Is this due to unfavorable weather conditions, insufficient labor by the people, or is there another reason for this? In reality, it is nothing more than internal wars and banditry, preventing people from farming, inconvenient transportation, and excessive taxes, leading to this surplus in one area and deficit in another. Those with a surplus are unable to sell it, while those with a deficit find it cheaper to buy from foreign countries. The reason for this must be attributed to poor governance.</p>
<h3>Contraction of Credit and Cash</h3>
<p>May the citizens unite to eliminate all unproductive credit inflation.</p>
<p>Reduce unnecessary consumption.</p>
<p>May banks not excessively tighten credit for productive enterprises.</p>
<p>May the people not hoard their savings unproductively.</p>
<p>The huge gap in international lending, the extensive damage to national wealth, and the large depreciation of liquid assets have been described above. The foundation of commercial credit lies in assets and cash. Although credit lending in financial and commercial markets amounts to millions or tens of millions, the actual cash settlements only account for a small portion. Eighty to ninety percent are represented by assets. Therefore, if there is a widespread loss of assets, the credit lending in the market will lose its balance, and a large portion of the credit will either become stagnant or result in losses. For example, if a merchant cannot recover the debts owed by a customer, the merchant will not be able to repay the debt owed to the money shop. The bank will not be able to recover the loans it has extended to the money shop. As a result, the bank will not only be unable to re-lend the debts that can be recovered, but will also have to recover a portion of other loans to compensate for the unrecoverable portion. The same applies to the money shop's relationship with the merchant and the merchant's relationship with the customer. Therefore, regardless of the amount of stagnant or lost credit, the contraction of overall market credit will inevitably be one or several times greater.</p>
<p>In the 20th year, the government increased the issuance of public bonds by 380 million yuan. The total transaction amount of public bonds throughout the year was 375.7 million yuan, including 334.1 million yuan in futures trading and 41.6 million yuan in spot trading. The ratio of futures trading to spot trading was eight to one. Although bond prices soared in the first half of the year and plummeted in the second half due to current events, the annual average, compared to the 19th year, still increased by 4.46 yuan, as shown in the following list:</p>
<p>Year, Type, Average Price Index, Increase/Decrease Percentage, Yuan</p>
<p>19th Year, 22 types, 65.18, 100.00</p>
<p>20th Year, 27 types, 69.64, 106.84, Increase of 7%</p>
<p>From September of this year, bond prices have been falling daily, becoming increasingly lower. Now, comparing the year-end prices with those of the 19th year at the same time:</p>
<p>19th Year, Yuan</p>
<p>December, 18 types, 75.37, 100</p>
<p>20th Year, Yuan</p>
<p>December, 0.42, 68. The contraction of credit volume is evident from this.</p>
<p>This year, Shanghai land prices continued to rise and increase. The total transaction amount for the year reached 130 million taels. The dangers of severe inflation in public bonds and real estate were vehemently discussed in last year's report. Unexpectedly, this year it has become even more intense, leading to an unnatural inflation of stable credit. Public bonds represent a type of manufactured credit. If the funds obtained are not used for production but only increase consumption inflation and high prices, land prices represent a stable manufacturing popularity, causing the majority of intermediaries to raise prices, promote transactions, and compete for unproductive profits, creating a false prosperity. None of this increases true assets. Therefore, once the market changes, the reaction is greater, and the impact on credit contraction is more severe. As credit contracts, everyone hoards cash, and cash becomes scarcer. In the 20th year, the Hangzhou Mint added 91.3 million yuan in silver coins, while the cash reserves in the Shanghai market only increased by 33.7 million yuan. At the end of the 20th year, the cash reserves were 177.51 million yuan. The net import volume of raw silver in China at the end of the 20th year was over 45 million Customs taels, while the cash reserves in the Shanghai market decreased by 18 million taels. At the end of the 20th year, the reserves were 53.213 million taels. Silver in China is purely a medium for commercial transactions. The reduction of these 18 million taels in reserves is sufficient to represent a contraction of some commercial credit. Therefore, silver interest rates are extraordinarily high. Before September of the 20th year, the highest silver interest rate was 20 per mille, and the lowest was no interest. After September, the lowest was 8 per mille, and the highest was 60 per mille. Continuing this trend, credit will contract further, cash will become more expensive, cash will become scarcer, and credit will decrease further, inevitably leading to higher industrial and commercial costs, lower prices, weaker purchasing power, and a greater decline in industry and commerce. This is a certain cause and effect of the global market downturn, and China cannot avoid this impact.</p>
<p>Fortunately, China has one difference from other countries in the world. All other countries in the world are on the gold standard. Once credit changes and cash is lacking, hard currency flows out of the country, shaking the foundation of the monetary system. The government must issue a law to suspend the cash standard. China is on the silver standard. Although people store cash, there is no outflow of cash abroad. However, the decline of industry and commerce and the collapse of the social economy may lead to widespread poverty among the people. The people of our country should regard this as a fundamental national crisis and work together to save it. The way to save it is nothing more than the entire nation, from top to bottom, eliminating all unproductive credit inflation, reducing all unnecessary consumption, banks not excessively tightening credit for productive enterprises, and the people not unproductively hoarding their hard-earned money. This is what this bank must warn and earnestly hope from its compatriots.</p>
<h3>The Way to World Prosperity and Restoration</h3>
<p>If the human psychology does not fundamentally change,</p>
<p>World peace, East Asian peace, and Chinese peace,</p>
<p>All cannot be achieved; world prosperity cannot be restored.</p>
<p>For several years, politicians, economists, and industrialists around the world have been scheming and researching various plans to save the declining world. However, the world market has become increasingly decadent. When the Sino-Japanese conflict arose, Japan, which was not involved in the vortex of the European war, experienced an even more severe commercial depression. China, content with its immature economic structure, also fell into this storm of recession. The economic decline of the world has reached its entirety, and the day of prosperity and restoration is becoming increasingly distant. There are different opinions on the root cause of the disease. Some say it is overproduction, some say it is tariff barriers, some say it is unequal cash distribution, and some say it is unresolved reparations issues. However, if production is restricted, farmers will reduce their income, workers will lose their jobs, and purchasing power will decrease even more. If tariff barriers are removed, countries will be even more afraid of their own inherent industries being overturned, leading to an increase in international lending imbalances. If creditor countries do not extract the cash they are owed, there are concerns that the debtor countries' weak strength and credit will make it impossible to recover the debts. If countries abandon German reparations, countries such as France and Belgium will have increased fears of Germany's resurgence. Even in the Eastern question, those who favor Japan say that the dispute arose because China was deeply closed and refused to give Japan an outlet for its surplus population and surplus production. Those who refute this say that Japan's development in China has never been satisfied with simply residing and doing business, but has gone further to seek territorial expansion. However, if China freely opens its doors, Japan will inevitably say that to ensure the safety of Japan's economic outlet in China, it must have a political and military advantage in China to prevent the threat of other powers. At the same time, if Japan truly abandons the concept of territorial aggression and focuses solely on the convenience of economic development, China must seek economic autonomy for the survival of its nation and cannot allow Japan's arbitrary development to hinder China's economic construction. However, how to maintain economic autonomy requires a solid defense first. Japan must remove all military equipment on Chinese territory to avoid disputes between the two countries that disrupt the economy and lead to further deterioration of the world market. Therefore, whether it is the world issue or the Eastern issue, the sources of the disease are intricate and cannot be solved by partial treatment. The fundamental solution lies in a thorough change in the human psychology. The progress of world science and materials can promote the common interests of countries. For example, the invention of radio and airplanes promotes the communication of international culture and knowledge and awakens the consciousness of small and weak countries to independence and equality. The development of mass production by machines makes the development of producing countries dependent on the prosperity of consuming countries. However, the national psychology of the world has not yet escaped the narrow and selfish national ideas of the 18th and 19th centuries. In short, the progress of human psychology has not kept pace with the progress of science and materials, resulting in the tragic situation of the world today. Even in Japan, the progress of materials in the past decade has relied on the development of foreign markets, but the national psychology still holds the ideas of "revere the emperor and expel the barbarians" from before the Meiji era, considering the national hegemony and the expansion of territory as the honor of the nation. This cannot coexist with the path of economic and peaceful development, and only sows the seeds of centuries of disaster in the Far East. Therefore, if the psychology of the people of Europe and America does not change, they cannot restore mutual trust. If the psychology of the Japanese people does not change, they cannot permanently end the Sino-Japanese dispute. If either of these two is not achieved, there is no way to restore world prosperity. Moreover, speaking of our Chinese people, with the rapid progress of world science, they still boast of their 4,000 years of culture, and with the fierce economic competition in the world, they still cling to the clichés of 400 million people, vast land, and abundant resources. If, from now on, we can unite from top to bottom, change our outdated psychology, use scientific methods, and promote mechanical construction, then not only can we improve the psychology of suspicion and arrogance within the country, the habit of focusing on words rather than deeds, and eliminate internal wars, but the ideas and actions of the people of other countries can also be approached and melted due to the relationship of international mutual assistance. All misunderstandings and conflicts can be resolved, and perhaps the Chinese people can also contribute to the peace of the Far East and the world. Therefore, we dare to assert that to restore the prosperity of the world, we must thoroughly change the psychology of mankind. We financial practitioners live in the prosperity of the world and are even more deeply connected to the peace of the East. Therefore, we cannot put it aside as a political issue.</p>
