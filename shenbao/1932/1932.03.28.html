<p>時評</p>
<h3>救亡與訓練靑年彬</h3>
<p>去年九一八東北禍變突發。進而演成爲今年一二八上海空前之慘禍。此一變局。實爲甲午以來第二次之大挫折。吾人於承受此一次大挫折之餘。當可知我國今仍百不如人。欲謀挽救危亡一切都應力自振刷。從新開頭。而於爲立國之本之敎育。則尤應順應當前情勢之要求。予以澈底之刷新。吾人認爲當前我人對於敎育之要求即當前我國敎育之目的。應爲㈠解放我民族。㈡解放個人。換言之。即對外抗禦外侮。對内澄清政治。以求我民族之獨立自由與我人民痛苦之解脱。</p>
<p>然而欲使敎育完成此一使命。達到此一目的。則對於青年必實施嚴格之訓練。矯正　日因循奢靡之惡習。導其入於刻苦奮鬥之正途。今請提出訓練</p>
<p>目標數點。藉供國人之商榷。</p>
<p>近年以來學風日替。靑年學生之驕恣奢靡。相習成風。飲食起居。極奢侈。一衣之費。可供農村一人一歲之温飽。一食之費。亦當平民一月之生活。其尤甚者。如舞塲之揮霍。以及種種娛樂塲所之靡費。則尤無可估計。但知消耗。而絲毫不知物力之艱難。男學生養成少爺。女學生皆爲小姐。國家多一學生。即無異多一消耗之漏巵。即留學生亦無有如日本德國學生之刻苦勤奮。此種驕奢淫佚之風氣實爲戕賊靑年斷送我國本之利斧。今後亟應嚴加矯正。最低限度。男生禁着西服。女生提倡布衣。養成其刻苦耐勞實踐奮鬥之精神。此最低限度之希望。如尙不能逹到。則吾人不能不承認敎育爲無用。此其一也。由於驕奢淫佚恶習之戕賊今日之靑年學生。大多意志薄弱。且無健全之身體。此頽唐與衰弱之靑年實予我民族前途以極大之威脅。故今後亟應着重訓練靑年。鍜練身體。養成健全之靑年以養成健全之民族。此其二也。國危至此。吾人今日但應以國家與民族之利益爲前提。尤應具有爲民族爲羣衆而犧牲之偉大精神。絶不容囿於個人之利害。但謀個人之福利。而此種爲民族爲羣衆而犧牲之偉大精神。决非一朝一夕所能養成。故今後亟應着力於斯點。潛移默化。朝夕薰陶。寝以養成此種民族精神。此其三也。今日政治之黑暗。類都知其由於官吏之貪污。然而若輩亦昔日之學生靑年也。故對於今日之學生。亟應養成其不苟取之人格。庶將來服務社會或爲國効力。不至再如今日之糟成一團。此其四也。外人今日之譏我者。類都謂我民族散漫如一盤散沙。毫無團結力。實則我民族之未能堅固團結。要亦爲無可諱言。夫惟團結不固。故致今日侮不能禦。國勢阽危。有若纍卵。今後若不發揮我民族之精神。堅固團結。則我民族之前途。殆眞不可測。然而欲求我民族之團結。則亟應以養成靑年學生集團生活之習慣爲起點。此其五也。</p>
<p>總之時至今日。我民族之一綫希望。全繫於正在訓練培植中之學生靑年欲得佳果。必種好因。願我敎育界諸君子重視其責任。愼毋一誤再誤也。</p>

<p>停戰會議於昨日休會、今晨十時將繼續會議、會議中最佔重要部份、厥爲徹兵程序、如此問題不得解决、則雖將協定第一第二兩項及附件文字議妥、停戰協定、總難成立、故今日會議、頗爲重要、届時正式會議、與小組會議、將同時舉行、正式會討諭協定第一第三兩項字面之修正、及其他問題、小組會則專議撤兵問題、如今晨小組會討諭得有結果、則下午將再繼續開正式會、根據小組會之結果、提出討論、如小組會無結果、則下午正式會停開、俟小組會討諭有結果時、再行開會、</p>
<h3>郭泰祺之談話各團體救國</h3>
<p>聯合會於昨日下午六時、推派代表殷芝齡殷汝　等、赴外部辦事處、面訽停戰會議情形、及應付方針、據郭次長稱、此次上海停戰會議、各友邦根據國聯决議案極力調解、經中日雙方外交代表分别請示政府、核准成立撤兵協定原則、而舉行正式會議、不料連日會議四五次、因日方堅持日兵只能退至獅子林楊行大塲及眞如等處、除證明連日所傳日方毫無撤兵之誠意外、可説毫無結果、我方對正式會議、雖有軍事代表戴司令等參加、但首席代表、仍由外交官充任、而日方首席代表、則換以軍人植田充任、對其外交公使會同各友邦所議之事前協定、不加注意、而提違背國聯决議案、及各友邦之撤兵地點、而使會議進行遲緩、殊爲憾事、故除將日提撤兵地點電逹政府請示、及報告顏代表轉國聯特委會外、今後是否照常進行、我方尙持保留態度、須候政府訓示而定、總之、此次上海停戰會議、由各友邦根據國聯决議案而調解、爲世界所注意、絕無秘密可言、我方對各友邦調解討論協定原則時、爲顧全進行起見、未　將討諭情形盡量公告、各方頗多誤會、但協定原則旣經决定、凡所討諭、應不離協定範圍及原則精神、隨時公告、俾明瞭其所以注意之上海停戰會議之進行、末後殷代表等告以日方連日在江灣與大塲　百畝間佈置鐵絲網並埋藏巨量地雷、及挖掘極長之戰壕、軍用品之輸送、極形忙碌、及其報載居留民在虹口倶樂部、集合示威、反對日軍撤兵、及請願設立中立區舉動、由日軍司令代表列席指導、與停戰會　日代表所提違反協定原則之撤兵地點、均係日方一貫的無誠意撤兵之表示、應請於會議時特别注意云、</p>
<h3>蔡廷錯之談話日日社云</h3>
<p>據新自蘇州來滬之某軍官語日日社記者云、在休養中之十九路軍軍長蔡廷　氏、對於中日撤兵會議、發表意見如下、我國尊重各友邦善意之勸告、出席停戰撤兵會議、原期日方能遵守三項原則之協定、早日撤兵、乃會議三日、日方毫無誠意、藉口多端、始終不肯退至原則第二項所定之地點、儼然以戰勝國侵佔領土自居、此豈我國所能忍受、本軍受命黨國、但知禦侮、不知其他、本人經將此意鄭重電告戴戟黄强二同志、對於日方撤兵、非照第二項原則、無諭如何、絕不承認、設不幸會議破裂、日方敢以暴力侵犯、本軍自當一秉平昔誓死衛國之精神、抵抗到底、言　不勝其激昂之槪、</p>
<h3>停戰中槍砲聲</h3>
<p>可證日方無誠意</p>
<p>華漕日兵向我開槍國民社云、昨（二十七）上午十時許、滬西曹家渡華漕一帶蘇州河北、所駐之日本軍隊、派出步哨、突向我蘇州河南所駐之税警團哨兵、隔河開槍轟擊、經我軍立即抵抗、相持至半小時之久始已、雙方尚無死傷、</p>
<p>嘉定西面砲聲甚烈昨有自嘉定逃滬者云、前夜約十一時許、忽聞西面砲聲甚烈、並雜以猛烈之機關槍聲、居民均從夢中驚起、旣覺砲聲愈趨愈近、乃完全乘夜逃出、繞道來滬、人数極衆、</p>
<p>太倉備受日機蹂躪太倉方面、昨有大批難民抵滬、現寓戰區難民收容所内、據難民陸常仙云、近日太倉尙無甚驚惶、惟城内已被飛機炸毁、在太倉附近之各鎭、亦多受日機之蹂躪、雙鳳·支塘·浮橋·沙溪·等鄕、尙屬安謐、惟運輸斷絕、糧食甚爲缺乏、浮橋鎭居民餓斃者頗多、各鎭迭請太倉縣長趙恩鉅、將歷年存儲之積榖振濟、趙縣長僅允每鎭索米、至多祇能得五十擔、且須分五次支取、至浮橋横涇各鄕、時有日兵登岸、擅取糧食、取得即去、并不多留、居民甚感痛苦云、</p>
<p>江灣日軍防禦工作日日社云、據確息、最近兩日中、日軍在江灣方面、積極佈置陣地、聞日劃該處爲第三道防線、自江灣香花橋以至屈家橋、廣生威士製革廠一帶、蜿蜒五里許、均掘有極鞏固之戰壕、前埋以地雷、後佈以鐵絲網、此項工程、均强拉民夫勒迫工作、現江灣方面、已斷絕通行、成爲神秘之區云、</p>
<p>追紀</p>
<h3>滬戰之第一夜</h3>
<p>今日適满二月</p>
<p>足爲信史一頁</p>
<p>兩月前之今日、閘北江灣吳淞等處、農耕於野、商趨於市、工勤於肆、弦歌之聲、聞於庠序、維子嬉於庭前、少婦妝於樓頭、熙熙攘攘、如登春臺、詎意即夜横禍遽降、不數日間、繁盛之區、化爲焦土、數十萬户、毁滅無餘、無老無幼、慘遭非命、屍骸旣殲、犬復噬之、修羅之塲、寗能過是、其幸而獲存者、漂泊無依、鰥寡孤獨、比比皆是、悠悠蒼天、此何人哉、爰將上海泰晤士報所纪一月二十八夜宼軍攻我閘北前準備之情形、補譯如次、藉作滬戰二週月之追念、其言且出於中立國人之口、足爲日人首先挑置信史之一頁、昔者普法戰後、法人繪普軍獲勝法軍慘敗情形於油書院、以爲暮鼓晨鐘之寄、卒以上下一心、發憤圖强、五十年後、摧强寇於疆塲、而有凡爾賽條約之簽訂、返失地於兩州、譯者不敏、竊師此意、亦願我國民毋忘滬戰之第一夜、而圖所以奮發自强也、</p>
<p>昨日（一月二十八日）午夜將近、日軍向閘北進攻、（注意）據日軍方面消息、夜十一時五十七分、日兵發第一彈、以回答華兵、（日人之言當然如是）日軍進攻迅速、卒出不意、故在上午（二十九日）十二時十五分之前、即有兩卡車、載所俘華兵、（譯者按此殆爲所拘之中國平民）馳至登陸隊司令部之庭前矣、夜中閘北邉界一帶、機關槍聲與來福槍聲、怒嗚不已、日軍第一大隊與第二大隊、已開始穿北四川路外之小街前進、槍聲一嗚、伏於各處牆隅之兵、齊起直撲華兵衛守之地點、隨手而下者數處、日兵之機關槍聲與歡呼聲相應和、日兵所擲之炸彈、炸力甚猛、四川路一帶之玻璃窗、受震多碎、遙想彼等所政繫之區域、受創必重、附近華人所蒙之損失、今猶無法估計之、</p>
<p>進攻之兩大隊、似皆以北車站爲其目的物、第三大隊亦在豫備進攻中、第一大隊由北四川路公立學校穿横街而進、與北寳山路商務印書館附近之華兵交鋒、另有若干人、在登陸隊司令部後與華兵接觸、第　大隊已在桃山咖啡館附近奥迪安影戲院後出四川路、兩大隊齊向鐵路方面進發、攻入上海市羲勇軍防守之地、（注意）</p>
<p>昨夜（二十八日）十一時三十分、日水手與海軍陸戰隊約一千名、鐵甲車八輛、機關槍兵無數、炸彈兵數隊、同離北四川路海軍登陸隊司令部、埋伏於昆連華界之各地點、準備攻入華境、以鮫島大尉指揮全軍、將近午夜、各隊沿北四川路絡繹而進、以　上刺刀五十人之小隊數隊、蹲伏租界邊線之屋隅、另以人數更少之數隊、潛入華境爲斥堠、鐵甲車分駐各地點、候令前發、醫務隊携舁牀藥囊、伺於左右、機關槍兵則在守候之各隊前列、作豫備放、　時北四川路之景象、儼如比國之佛蘭特、所不同者、各隊軍官皆佩金柄之刀耳、</p>
<p>日軍之欲佔據中國土地也、租界中之日僑、早已喧傅矣、（注意）故在各隊由登陸隊司令部出發以前、已有日平民數百人、集於其地、紛向兵士歡呼、司令部垣内將士雲集、成一大營、上海泰晤士報代表、曾竚立司令部側汽車間之屋頂、以觀日兵之集隊、舍該代表外、塲中無一西人焉、</p>

<p>本埠增刊隨便談談破裂！緩和！佛　　破裂！緩和！續有進展！談無結束！前途渺茫！重行調解！這是近日各報登載停戰會議情形，其標題大槪如此，　　就照一點來看，日本外交手段的厲害，與停戰會議之毫無誠意，已昭然若揭，本來戰則戰，停則停，用不着有什麽會議，停戰而有會議，根本上已是極大謬誤，此次上海戰事，原爲日方主動，我方本僅自衛，故此次撤兵與否，全在日本，無所用其會議也，若欲會議非俟日軍撤盡之後不可，　　國聯議决案有曰『第一點，聲明國聯不能承認或容許侵犯中國之領土完整，與政治主權，第二點，在武力壓迫下解决目前爭執爲不合法，』又國聯大會宣言曰『榷認遠東衝突，如在當事國一方兵力壓迫之下，以求解决，則爲違反國聯盟約精神，』　　若照國聯議决案及宣言簡單的解釋，任何國家，不許以武力奪取權利，亦任何國家，不許在兵力壓迫下以求解决，任何一國苟有此種舉動者，均爲違反國聯議决案精神，若照這様看來，在日軍未撤盡以前，任何會議均屬謬誤，　　當上海戰事發生之初，日方迭次宣言日本不要在滬權利，不要上海地盤，旣經如此，則日本欲停戰則停戰耳，欲撤兵則撤兵耳，何會議之有，并且近日日方，一面雖揚言撤兵，一面則積極進兵，撤兵少而進兵多，其意果何在耶，果有撤兵之誠意耶，故我謂　　撤兵會議是根本上之謬誤，日軍未曾撤盡以前不應開任何會議，　　如開此種會議决無好結果好希望，馮玉祥軼事少林　　馮煥章氏布衣氈帽，飲食粗糲，或者説這是他的矯揉造作，我也承認他是矯揉造作，但是他能夠矯揉造作，始終如一，就是他的好處，試問其他領袖要人，何爲不肯矯揉造作，編要從驕奢淫逸，縱欲敗度上走呢？近日國府任命他做内政部長，他三次辭呈，不願担任，因爲他對於政治經騐，自知缺乏，不肯硬　，就道一點，我也認爲他能自知之明，不像其他要人，明知自已斡不下去，偏要去硬幹，比較一下，豈不是差勝一籌麽？茲特將少林君所記馮玉祥軼事披露如左。　　馮煥章氏邇來奔走京滬，幹旋國事，人皆屬目，而其最引人注意之處，則爲其老農裝朿，藍布棉襖，棉大衣，布腰帶，氈帽，布鞋，布襪，不知者或謂其爲矯揉造作，以自詡特異。不知馮氏儉樸，乃爲其素性，不特其自奉如此，即其治軍行政，亦莫不本此出發。茲錄其數端如下，藉供讀者苶餘酒後之談助也。　　(一)軍中無階级：馮氏治軍時，設有人至其軍中参觀，則當詫異何以僅見士兵，不見官長。蓋軍中主自馮氏，下至士兵，均一律着自製棉布軍衣，軍帽，布鞋　，布襪，冬則加一棉大衣，絲毫無優劣之分。絕未見如南方軍官之華逹呢，毛嗶嘰，皮裏腿，長馬靴，西洋大衣，一見而知其爲官長也者。除由腰上皮帶可識别其爲官長或士兵，由胸前徽章可辨認其階級外，驟視之，蓋一無差别也。（二）白開水鹹菜請客；馮氏在洛陽時，嘗召集全體官佐至西宫大校塲聚餐，到者數百人。馮氏命排律成四方形，席地坐下。馮氏與其夫人李德全及總參謀長曹一浩森氏居中，亦坐地上·地多灰土，没股幾半尺。須臾馮氏謂；『你們都帶了糢么？』衆皆愕然，以爲旣係聚餐，何以要各人帶糢，但畏馮無敢問者，祇得齊聲答曰：『没有』『没有』，馮氏又謂衆曰；『大家回去拿糢再來』，一時數百人從灰土中掙扎起來，股上灰土纷纷墜下，但無人敢拍，以大家久已習於此種坐地集會，拍灰土乃馮氏所厲禁也。未幾衆復集，仍就原地坐下。當時馮氏衛兵已招來開水兩桶·鹹菜一籮·飯碗一筐。馮氏命各人將糢取出，自提飯碗一一散發，其夫人則提水壺隨後冲水，其總參謀長則散發每人鹹菜一塊。事完，馮氏自衣袋中取出糢數個與其夫人坐地分食，并各取鹹菜一塊，冲開水一碗佐食，其總參謀長亦如之。食畢，馮氏與人談諭軍中日常事故，於蜚諧中寓訓誡，使衆於歡笑中懷警惕，外如家人父子之歡聚一圑，實則森嚴之訓練即在其中也。（三）嚴禁烟酒嫖賭∶馮氏認爲烟酒嫖賭不特耗財，而且傷身廢事，故軍中懸爲厲禁。一次馮氏巡視某部，於痰盂中發現紙烟頭一個，即將該吸烟官員撤職拘禁，主管長官記過。又一次拘獲某營三連長及一副官聚义麻雀，當即召集全體軍官員佐訓話，將四人當塲槍斃，營長撤職監禁，圑長撤職，師旅長降級。其執法之嚴，蓋使人心膽戰慄，而無復敢冒險嘗試者也。（四）不准軍人坐事∶馮氏不准軍人坐黄包車，其意不徒爲節省金錢，亦且寓人道顴念。嘗有詩云∶『一人坐車一人拉，同是人類有牛馬；重重壓迫眞痛苦，惟盼仁者來救他。』觀此，可知馮氏平民思想之濃厚也。（五）隻身出巡∶馮氏出入，素無扈從。而其服裝特壞，又從不偑徽章，故非素識者，决不能辨認其爲總司令也，常一人至各部漫步觀察，如發現有何參差，即取小册記下時刻地址，初不追問其犯者爲誰。歸後即召該主管長官，問是否知其事。不知則令詳查具報，然後分别懲處，上自主官，下至犯者，無或能免。如所報核與事實不符，或不能查明犯者爲誰，則該主管長官且將受重罰也。（六）親近農民∶馮氏每至一處，日必令地方長官召三數農民入司令部談話，問猪問牛，歴數小時不倦。因是馮氏司令部前，常有短衣赤足，蓬首垢面之眞正農民出入其間，門衛前僅説一句『見總司令，』即可直入無阻也·</p>

        <h1>1932.03.28</h1>
<h3>Salvation and Training of Youth</h3>
<p>Last year, the September 18th Incident in the Northeast suddenly erupted, further evolving into the unprecedented January 28th Shanghai Incident this year. This change is indeed the second major setback since the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895. After enduring this major setback, we should realize that our country is still far behind others in every aspect. To save the nation from peril, we must make every effort to revitalize ourselves and start anew. In particular, education, which is fundamental to nation-building, should be thoroughly reformed to meet the demands of the current situation. We believe that our current demands for education, that is, the purpose of our country's education, should be: ㈠ to liberate our nation; ㈡ to liberate the individual. In other words, to resist foreign aggression externally and to rectify politics internally, in order to achieve the independence and freedom of our nation and the relief of our people from suffering.</p>
<p>However, in order for education to fulfill this mission and achieve this goal, strict training must be implemented for young people, to correct the long-standing bad habits of complacency and extravagance, and to guide them onto the right path of hard work and struggle. Now, let us propose several training</p>
<p>objectives for the consideration of the people of the country.</p>
<p>In recent years, the academic atmosphere has deteriorated daily, and the arrogance and extravagance of young students have become a common practice. Their food, clothing, and accommodation are extremely luxurious. The cost of one piece of clothing can provide warmth and sustenance for a person in the countryside for a year. The cost of one meal is equivalent to the monthly living expenses of an ordinary person. What is even worse is the extravagance in dance halls and the waste in various entertainment venues, which are beyond estimation. They only know how to consume and have no idea of the difficulty of obtaining resources. Male students are raised as young masters, and female students are all treated as young ladies. Adding one student to the country is no different from adding a leaky vessel of consumption. Even students studying abroad are not as hardworking and diligent as students in Japan and Germany. This kind of arrogant, extravagant, and dissolute atmosphere is indeed a sharp axe that harms young people and ruins the foundation of our country. In the future, we should strictly correct this. At the very least, male students should be prohibited from wearing Western suits, and female students should be encouraged to wear cloth clothing, cultivating their spirit of hard work, endurance, practice, and struggle. This is the minimum expectation. If this cannot be achieved, then we cannot but admit that education is useless. This is the first point. Due to the harm of arrogant, extravagant, and dissolute bad habits, most of today's young students have weak wills and unhealthy bodies. This decadent and weak youth poses a great threat to the future of our nation. Therefore, in the future, we should focus on training young people, strengthening their bodies, and cultivating healthy young people to cultivate a healthy nation. This is the second point. Our country is in such a crisis that we should now prioritize the interests of the country and the nation, and we should have the great spirit of sacrificing for the nation and the masses. We must never be confined to personal interests and only seek personal well-being. However, this great spirit of sacrificing for the nation and the masses cannot be cultivated overnight. Therefore, in the future, we should focus on this point, subtly influence, and constantly nurture them, gradually developing this national spirit. This is the third point. Today's political darkness is generally known to be due to the corruption of officials. However, those people were also students and young people in the past. Therefore, we should urgently cultivate the integrity of not taking ill-gotten gains in today's students, so that in the future, when they serve society or work for the country, they will not be as messed up as they are today. This is the fourth point. What foreigners criticize us for today is that our nation is scattered like a sheet of loose sand, with no unity. In fact, the failure of our nation to unite firmly is undeniable. Because the unity is not strong, we cannot resist insults and the country's situation is in danger, like a pile of eggs. If we do not promote the spirit of our nation and strengthen unity in the future, then the future of our nation is truly unpredictable. However, to seek the unity of our nation, we should start by cultivating the habit of group life for young students. This is the fifth point.</p>
<p>In short, at this moment, the only hope for our nation is tied to the students and young people who are being trained and cultivated. To get good fruit, you must plant good seeds. We hope that the gentlemen in the education field will value their responsibilities and be careful not to make mistakes again and again.</p>
<h3>Ceasefire Conference Adjourned Yesterday</h3>
<p>Meeting to Continue at 10 AM This Morning</p>
<p>Formal Sub-Committee to Meet Simultaneously</p>
<p>The ceasefire conference adjourned yesterday. It will continue at 10 AM this morning. The most important part of the conference is the procedure for troop withdrawal. If this issue is not resolved, even if the first and second articles of the agreement and the text of the annex are agreed upon, the ceasefire agreement will still be difficult to establish. Therefore, today's meeting is very important. At that time, the formal meeting and the sub-committee meeting will be held simultaneously. The formal meeting will discuss the revision of the wording of the first and third articles of the agreement, as well as other issues. The sub-committee will focus on the issue of troop withdrawal. If the sub-committee meeting this morning reaches a result, then the formal meeting will continue in the afternoon, and the discussion will be based on the result of the sub-committee meeting. If the sub-committee meeting has no result, then the formal meeting in the afternoon will be suspended until the sub-committee meeting has a result before it is reconvened.</p>
<h3>Guo Taiqi's Remarks: National Salvation of Various Organizations</h3>
<p>At 6 PM yesterday afternoon, the Joint Association dispatched representatives Yin Zhiling, Yin Ru, etc., to the Foreign Ministry Office to inquire about the situation of the ceasefire conference and the coping strategies. According to Deputy Minister Guo, at this Shanghai ceasefire conference, friendly countries are doing their best to mediate based on the resolutions of the League of Nations. After the diplomatic representatives of China and Japan separately requested instructions from their governments, they approved the principle of establishing a troop withdrawal agreement and held a formal meeting. Unexpectedly, after several meetings for four or five days, the Japanese side insisted that Japanese troops could only withdraw to places such as Shizilin, Yanghang Dachang, and Zhenru. In addition to proving that the Japanese side has no sincerity in withdrawing troops, it can be said that there is no result at all. Although military representatives such as Commander Dai participated in our formal meeting, the chief representative was still a diplomat. The chief representative of the Japanese side was replaced by the military officer Ueda. They did not pay attention to the prior agreement discussed by the diplomatic envoys and friendly countries, and put forward troop withdrawal locations that violated the resolutions of the League of Nations and friendly countries, which slowed down the progress of the meeting. It is a pity. Therefore, in addition to sending a telegram to the government to request instructions on the troop withdrawal locations proposed by the Japanese side, and reporting to Representative Yan to the Special Committee of the League of Nations, we are still holding a reserved attitude on whether to proceed as usual in the future, which will depend on the instructions of the government. In short, this Shanghai ceasefire conference is mediated by friendly countries based on the resolutions of the League of Nations and is attracting worldwide attention. There is absolutely no secret. In order to take care of the progress when our side discusses the principles of the agreement with friendly countries, we have not fully announced the discussion situation, and there are many misunderstandings. However, after the principles of the agreement have been determined, all discussions should not deviate from the scope of the agreement and the spirit of the principles, and should be announced at any time, so as to understand the progress of the Shanghai ceasefire conference that is attracting attention. Finally, Representative Yin and others informed that the Japanese side had been setting up barbed wire and burying a large number of landmines in the area between Jiangwan and Dachang, and digging extremely long trenches. The transportation of military supplies was extremely busy, and the news reported that residents gathered and demonstrated at the Hongkou Club, opposing the withdrawal of Japanese troops and petitioning to establish a neutral zone, which was guided by representatives of the Japanese military commanders attending the meeting. The troop withdrawal locations proposed by the Japanese representatives at the ceasefire conference, which violated the principles of the agreement, were all consistent expressions of the Japanese side's insincerity in withdrawing troops, and should be paid special attention to during the meeting.</p>
<h3>Cai Tingkai's Remarks: The Nichinichi Shimbun Reports</h3>
<p>According to a military officer who recently came to Shanghai from Suzhou, Cai Tingkai, commander of the 19th Route Army who is recuperating, expressed the following opinions on the Sino-Japanese troop withdrawal conference. Our country respects the well-intentioned advice of friendly countries and attends the ceasefire and troop withdrawal conference, originally hoping that the Japanese side could abide by the three principles of the agreement and withdraw troops as soon as possible. However, after three days of the conference, the Japanese side showed no sincerity, made various excuses, and refused to withdraw to the locations stipulated in the second principle, as if they were occupying territory as a victorious country. How can this be tolerated by our country? Our army is ordered by the party and the country, and only knows how to resist foreign aggression, and knows nothing else. I have solemnly telegraphed this intention to Comrades Dai Ji and Huang Qiang. Regarding the withdrawal of Japanese troops, unless it is in accordance with the second principle, no matter what, we will never recognize it. If the conference unfortunately breaks down and the Japanese side dares to invade by force, our army will naturally adhere to the spirit of defending the country with death as always and resist to the end. His words could not hide his agitation.</p>
<h3>Gunfire During Ceasefire</h3>
<p>Proves Japanese Insincerity</p>
<p>Japanese Troops in Huacao Open Fire: The Guomin News Agency reports that yesterday (27th) at about 10 AM, Japanese troops stationed north of the Suzhou River in the Huacao area of Caojiadu, west of Shanghai, sent out sentries who suddenly opened fire across the river at the sentries of the tax police regiment stationed south of the Suzhou River. Our troops immediately resisted and the confrontation lasted for half an hour before it ended. There were no casualties on either side.</p>
<p>Heavy Gunfire West of Jiading: Yesterday, a refugee who fled to Shanghai from Jiading said that at about 11 PM the night before, they suddenly heard heavy gunfire from the west, mixed with fierce machine gun fire. Residents were awakened from their dreams and, feeling that the gunfire was getting closer and closer, fled completely at night, taking a detour to Shanghai. The number of people was very large.</p>
<p>Taicang Suffers from Japanese Air Raids: Yesterday, a large number of refugees from Taicang arrived in Shanghai and are now living in the war zone refugee camp. According to refugee Lu Changxian, there has not been much panic in Taicang recently, but the city has been destroyed by planes. The towns near Taicang have also suffered from Japanese air raids. Shuangfeng, Zhitang, Fuqiao, Shaxi, and other villages are still peaceful, but transportation is cut off and food is very scarce. Many residents of Fuqiao Town have starved to death. The towns have repeatedly requested Taicang County Magistrate Zhao Enju to use the grain stored over the years for disaster relief. County Magistrate Zhao only agreed to provide rice to each town, with a maximum of only 50 dan, and it must be collected in five installments. In the villages of Fuqiao and Hengjing, Japanese soldiers occasionally land on the shore, take grain without permission, and leave without staying much, which makes the residents feel very painful.</p>
<p>Japanese Military Defensive Work in Jiangwan: The Nichinichi Shimbun reports that, according to reliable sources, in the past two days, the Japanese army has been actively setting up positions in the Jiangwan area. It is said that the Japanese have designated the area as the third line of defense. From Jiangwan Xianghuaqiao to Qujiaqiao and the Guang Sheng Wei Leather Factory area, winding for about five miles, extremely solid trenches have been dug, landmines have been buried in front, and barbed wire has been laid behind. This project is all done by forcing civilians to work. Now the Jiangwan area has been cut off and has become a mysterious area.</p>
<p>Remembrance</p>
<h3>The First Night of the Shanghai Battle</h3>
<p>Today Marks Two Months</p>
<p>A Page Worthy of Historical Record</p>
<p>Two months ago today, in Zhabei, Jiangwan, Wusong, and other places, farmers were cultivating in the fields, merchants were heading to the markets, workers were diligently working in their workshops, and the sounds of singing and music could be heard in the schools. Children were playing in the courtyards, and young women were putting on makeup in their rooms. The scene was bustling and prosperous, like ascending a spring terrace. Who would have thought that a sudden disaster would strike that very night? In just a few days, the prosperous areas were turned into scorched earth, hundreds of thousands of households were completely destroyed, and countless people, young and old, died tragically. The corpses were annihilated, and even the dogs devoured them. Could there be a more horrifying scene than this hellish place? Those who were fortunate enough to survive were displaced and helpless, with widows, widowers, and orphans everywhere. Oh, vast heavens, who is responsible for this? Therefore, I am supplementing the translation of the Shanghai Times' record of the preparations made by the enemy troops before attacking our Zhabei on the night of January 28th, as a commemoration of the two-month anniversary of the Shanghai Battle. These words come from the mouth of a neutral countryman and are worthy of being a page of reliable history recording the Japanese taking the initial steps to provoke the war. In the past, after the Franco-Prussian War, the French painted a picture depicting the French army's tragic defeat by the victorious Prussian army, as a reminder like the evening drum and morning bell. Eventually, with unity from top to bottom and determined efforts to become strong, they defeated the powerful enemy on the battlefield fifty years later and signed the Treaty of Versailles, returning the lost territories of the two states. This humble translator has secretly learned from this intention, and also hopes that our people will not forget the first night of the Shanghai Battle and strive to become strong.</p>
<p>Near midnight yesterday (January 28th), the Japanese army attacked Zhabei. (Note) According to the Japanese side, the first shot was fired by the Japanese troops at 11:57 PM in response to the Chinese troops. (The Japanese always say such things.) The Japanese army advanced quickly and unexpectedly, so before 12:15 AM on the morning of the 29th, there were two trucks carrying captured Chinese soldiers (translator's note: these were probably arrested Chinese civilians) to the courtyard of the landing force headquarters. During the night, the sounds of machine guns and rifles roared incessantly along the Zhabei border. The first and second battalions of the Japanese army had begun to advance through the small streets outside North Sichuan Road. As the gunfire sounded, the soldiers lurking in the corners of the walls rushed out and attacked the locations defended by the Chinese soldiers. Several places were captured with ease. The sound of Japanese machine guns and cheers echoed each other. The bombs thrown by the Japanese soldiers were very powerful, and many glass windows along Sichuan Road were shattered by the shock. It is imaginable that the areas they were attacking must have suffered heavy damage, and the losses suffered by the nearby Chinese people are still impossible to estimate.</p>
<p>Both attacking battalions seemed to have the North Railway Station as their objective. The third battalion was also preparing to attack. The first battalion advanced through the side streets from the public school on North Sichuan Road and clashed with the Chinese soldiers near the Commercial Press on North Baoshan Road. Several other people contacted the Chinese soldiers behind the landing force headquarters. The 　 battalion had exited Sichuan Road behind the Ottoman Theater near Taoshan Cafe, and both battalions advanced towards the railway, attacking the area defended by the Shanghai Volunteer Corps (note).</p>
<p>At 11:30 PM last night (January 28th), about 1,000 Japanese sailors and marines, eight armored vehicles, countless machine gunners, and several bomb squads left the naval landing force headquarters on North Sichuan Road and ambushed at various locations in the Chinese territory of Kunlian, preparing to attack the Chinese territory. Captain Samejima commanded the entire army. Near midnight, the teams advanced along North Sichuan Road in succession. Several squads of 　 with fifty men each squatted in the corners of the houses along the border of the concession, and several squads with even fewer people sneaked into the Chinese territory as scouts. Armored vehicles were stationed at various locations, waiting for orders to advance. The medical team carried stretchers and medicine bags, waiting on the left and right. The machine gunners were in the front row of each waiting team, preparing to fire. At that time, the scene on North Sichuan Road was like Flanders in Belgium. The only difference was that the officers of each team wore swords with gold handles.</p>
<p>The Japanese army's desire to occupy Chinese land had already been widely rumored among the Japanese residents in the concession (note). Therefore, before the teams departed from the landing force headquarters, hundreds of Japanese civilians had gathered there, cheering for the soldiers. Soldiers and generals gathered inside the headquarters, forming a large camp. The representative of the Shanghai Times once stood on the roof of the garage next to the headquarters to watch the Japanese soldiers gather. Apart from the representative, there was not a single Westerner in the venue.</p>
<p>At around 11 PM, the first assembled army, without sounding the horn, immediately filled the courtyard and the house. The sound of trucks rumbled on the road. Battalions of reinforcements, fully armed, flew in. In an instant, the garden was full of people. The machine gunners dragged their weapons and lined up in the center of the courtyard. Long lines of riflemen, mixed with grenade throwers, filed in. In the center of the square, there was a high platform, on which stood two naval staff officers, monitoring the assembly of the soldiers. The situation at this time was like a dream. Sailors poured out of the dark corners into the brightly lit square, the sound of their weapons rubbing together, their bayonets flashing, carrying dry rations and lightweight emergency equipment, the rifles all with bayonets fixed, carried across their backs, as were the machine gunners and those who carried the "man-eating" bullets. The officers paced among the soldiers, looking very relaxed (note). At that time, only the steel helmets were seen moving, and no sound was heard. Even the non-commissioned officers did not shout at the soldiers. Everyone knew their place and went to it (note). In less than fifteen minutes, each team was lined up and stood at attention, waiting for orders. Then the sound of the bugle came from the dark, and one of the officers on the platform spoke to the crowd, the words were very urgent and the voice was very strong. The Japanese translator beside me whispered to me that he was telling the soldiers to do their duty (note), not to do unnecessary killing unless it was urgent, and not to shoot unless they were tied up. (Translator's note: Since they are attacking, how can there be no shooting? In the Japanese officers' minds, the Chinese army in Zhabei would definitely retreat without a fight like the Northeast Army, so there was no need to shoot.) And wished everyone good luck. After speaking, the whole scene was silent. Then a team of Japanese photographers began to take flash photographs, and there were several loud explosion sounds, and the eyes of the crowd were temporarily blinded. Then another officer on the platform encouraged the crowd with a few words (note). Then the sound of the bugle sounded again, followed by the sound of artillery, which was the rapid entry of reinforcements from the Japanese warships moored in the Huangpu River. Once they were in position, four soldiers with bayonets fixed embraced a soldier holding the Rising Sun flag and walked into the bright spot. Then there was the sound of sharp orders and the sound of majestic leather shoes. The officers all drew their swords, and the two officers on the platform focused on the watch on their wrists (note). At that time, a dark corner suddenly burst into light, revealing several armored vehicles with soldiers standing on either side, the cars were orange-yellow, the small door of the orange-shaped dome was half-open, and a steel-helmeted head peered out from inside and outside. Suddenly, the sound of orders rang out, and the soldiers in the front row jumped onto the trucks. Soon the engine of the first truck started, and the rest of the trucks followed. But in an instant, the sound of the truck engines was drowned out by the shouts of the crowd outside the door. In less than fifteen minutes, the square was empty. There was a touching short scene, which I will try to record as follows: an old soldier with three A's on his sleeve suddenly stepped out of his team and ran along the wall under the car towards a young man. When he got close to him, he grabbed his hand and held it tightly. After a while, this short man in gray uniform ran back to his team, which had already set off. The young man turned 　 and left. These two were probably brothers (translator's note: these two must have been reluctant to leave because they did not know if they would see each other again after the battle. Alas, who does not have brothers, like hands and feet? Why do they have no compassion when slaughtering others?). When the last truck drove out of the square and the last team of sailors set off, the Times representative also left the place. At that time, a small group of Japanese civilians gathered outside the door, and it was not easy to squeeze out of the crowd. Whenever they saw a truck or armored vehicle passing by, they cheered. When the walking team passed by, they clapped and shouted wildly. The Japanese people in the nearby houses opened their windows to watch, and the voices of women shouting "Sayonara" (meaning goodbye) echoed the shouts of the men on the road. The sailors and marines all waved and laughed in response. Five minutes later, the trucks all arrived at their designated locations (note), and the soldiers jumped off the cars.</p>
<p>Following the soldiers into the quiet and dark area of Sichuan Road, groping and moving like snakes, as if to 　 to form a formation, not 　 holding their own lives in their hands, when advancing, they passed many teams kneeling and lying in the corners of the walls, they could only be seen when they were close, and they would trample on their bodies if they were not careful, because they were everywhere. Suddenly the gun and bayonet in the corner of the wall were 　 together, and an officer 　 up and asked in Japanese, the language was indistinguishable, and then a torch was lit and a white face was seen, and then he was restored, and this kind of lying soldiers was full of the area along the border of the Chinese territory, and no armored vehicles were seen, it was obvious that they had driven into the Chinese territory before the infantry, but no gunshots were heard, only silence, full of killing (note). The sound of issuing orders was not heard, and the weapons were not allowed to make any sound, the Japanese soldiers acted like black cats, extremely cautious, and wherever there were more teams stationed, there was a sentry in front, and several sentries had indeed sneaked into the Chinese territory at midnight, with their comrades following closely behind, with machine guns in the front row, with the muzzle of the gun facing outward (note).</p>
<p>The Times representative then took a car back, proceeding along Sichuan Road towards the center of the concession, and from time to time encountered small teams of Japanese soldiers, until the Suzhou River, these people were patrolling with guns, and their appearance was solemn, like the teams lurking along the Zhabei border (omitted below). Translator's note: On the 22nd of this month, Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshizawa said in a speech in the Diet that on January 28th, the Shanghai Public Concession's Board of Directors gathered to discuss and announced a temporary emergency state, and the troops of the major powers stationed in Shanghai all took on defense duties in various parts of the concession on that day in accordance with the jointly planned defense plan agreed upon in advance. The area that the Japanese army was in charge of was Zhabei. When the Japanese army was deploying in the Zhabei area, the Chinese shot at them, so the Japanese army was forced to take self-defense actions. However, the Board of Directors' resolution was to order the Japanese army to take charge of the defense of the Hongkou District, but even the western part of Hongkou did not belong to it. Now Yoshizawa actually said that the area that the Japanese army was in charge of was Zhabei, alas, is he deceiving people, or is he deceiving himself? If he said that he was deploying in Zhabei, why did he have to 　 night for it? As recorded in the Shanghai Times, the Japanese army was directly stealing it, and still wanted to use the word "self-defense" to cover up his mistakes, 寗 not different?</p>

<p>Shen Shuxia's opinion on the Association for the Support and Education of the Descendants of Martyrs Who Died Defending the Nation is that, in addition to providing support for the descendants of martyrs who died defending the nation, the association should also provide education and pay attention to practical skills in order to be useful.

<p>Since Director-General Raibaud took office, the Health Department of the French Concession Municipal Council has been actively providing medical care and medicine to poor residents, who are therefore very grateful. Last year, due to the large number of people suffering from dental diseases, a dental treatment room was specially established and experts were hired to provide treatment. Now that the number of residents is increasing, the previously scheduled dates of only three times a week are insufficient. The treatment time has been extended. It is reported that starting from April 1st, the dental treatment room will be open from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and from 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and from 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

<p>Crew Member on Icelandic Ship Sends Telegram Reporting They Are Safe</p>
<p>Family Members Receive Telegram of Comfort</p>
<p>The Shanghai-based newspaper "Zi Lin Bao" reports that the Dasing (transliterated) transport ship of the Andong Transport Company of this city was chartered to the Soviet Union last autumn to sail to the Kamchatka Peninsula. As it was about to return to Shanghai for the winter in early November, it was ordered to sail to the Aian Islands and the Shantalei Islands. On November 22, after arriving at Aian, it encountered severe sea ice and could not sail. After a month, an icebreaker arrived to tow the ship to Nagava. Later, food and coal ran out, and the crew was trapped in the Arctic Ocean, suffering from hunger and cold. Until recently, a wireless telegram was received from the shipowner stating that the weather was gradually improving and the ship was undamaged, but it still could not sail until mid-April. The crew's families are greatly comforted by this news.</p>
<p>Zhang Jinpei Danced All Night and Almost Kidnapped in the Early Morning</p>
<p>Carrying a Carload of Dancers</p>
<p>Kidnappers Jump Out on the Roadside</p>
<p>Musician Has Good Luck</p>
<p>Zhang Jinpei Has Good Fortune</p>
<p>Zhang Jinpei, a 20-year-old Shanghai native, lives at 92 Xinchang Lane, Wuxi Road, Public Concession. His ancestors made their fortune in real estate and are quite wealthy. He enjoys horse racing and associates with many wealthy playboys. Since the Shanghai Incident, he has been hiring singers and buying smiles, going in and out of dance halls, and has not diminished in the face of national crisis. Last Friday was Easter, and most dance halls were open until dawn to attract tourists. At 11:00 p.m. that night, Zhang and his friend Ye Xuechen went to the Datong Dance Hall on Yinghua Street for fun. They did not leave until 3:30 a.m. on the 26th. Before leaving, they used his own car, number 4814, to take the dancers Zhu Xiuying, Zhang Aizhen, Tang Jiumei, and Lin Buqing home. His friend Ye Xuechen also went in the same car. The car stopped on Yinghua Street, and as everyone was getting into the car, four kidnappers suddenly jumped out from the roadside, attempting to kidnap Zhang Jinpei. Two of them were holding pistols, forbidding the men and women in the car from making any noise. One of the kidnappers got into the driver's seat and drove the car towards Nanjing Road. At that time, a musician from the Datong Dance Hall, a Russian man, was hurriedly leaving with a violin case in his hand. Because the early morning wind was strong, he turned up his coat collar to cover his neck and slightly bent his waist as he staggered home. As he was walking to the intersection of Nanjing Road, car number 4814 suddenly drove up from behind. The kidnapper who was driving panicked and did not have time to brake, hitting the Russian man to the ground, injuring his head. The Russian man shouted loudly for the car to stop. Many of his companions came in a group and were shocked by the sight. They rushed forward, and with so many people and feet in disarray, there was a lot of noise. Because the Russians were speaking urgently, the kidnappers did not know what was happening and, fearing that the police would arrive, immediately abandoned the car and fled. Zhang Jinpei and the dancers were thus spared the ordeal of being kidnapped. Afterwards, the incident was reported to the Old Gate Police Station, which sent detectives to investigate.</p>
<p>Situation of Passenger and Freight Trains on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway resumed four express and slow passenger trains in each direction, the Shanghai South Railway Station has been extremely crowded with passengers getting on and off, several times more than on ordinary days. The passenger trains from Hangzhou are particularly crowded, with a total of no less than three to four thousand passengers arriving in Shanghai each day. About one thousand four to five hundred passengers travel from Shanghai to Hangzhou each day. The revenue from passenger tickets has increased significantly, but freight transport has suffered significant losses. Although one full freight train has resumed running between Zhapu and Shanghai, all other day and night trains, a total of six, as well as less-than-carload freight trains, are still suspended. Even after various transport companies requested the Railway Bureau to add less-than-carload freight trains, the request has not been approved. It is rumored that service may resume in early next month.</p>
<p>The Jinghu and Huhangyong Railway Police Department Moves to the South Railway Station to Work</p>
<p>The Jinghu and Huhangyong Railway Police Department had temporarily moved its offices to the Public Concession because the buildings in the North Railway Station area of the Jinghu Railway in Zhabei were mostly destroyed by Japanese aircraft. It has been a month since then. Yesterday, it was learned that the department has received orders from the Management Bureau to move to the South Railway Station of the Huhang Railway as a whole. It is said that the department has scheduled the move within the next few days.</p>
<p>Bansongyuan Opened Yesterday</p>
<p>Bansongyuan in South Shanghai, which had been closed to boycott Japanese goods and resist the invasion, reopened to sell tickets and resume business on March 26th, nearly two months later. It is said that there were quite a few visitors. Yesterday, Sunday, the crowds were even more congested. However, the shops in the garden, such as the advertising department of the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company and the teahouses and restaurants, were all open as usual. The remaining shops were still being rearranged and were quite busy.</p>
<p>Anhui People Oppose Adding a Surtax to Salt</p>
<p>The Anhui-Ningbo Shanghai Clan Association had previously opposed the Anhui Provincial Government's imposition of a surtax of 2.4 yuan per stone of edible salt, arguing that this illegal action had been carried out once last spring, but had been ordered to be abolished by the ministry due to the great opposition from the public. Now, Chen Tiaoyuan has taken advantage of the tense national crisis to restore the surtax. After the floods in Anhui, the people are poor and the wealth is exhausted, and it is impossible to implement the surtax. A telegram was sent to the National Government and the Ministry of Finance requesting that the original decision of last year be upheld and that Anhui Province be strictly ordered to abolish the surtax. Now that the surtax is being forcibly collected in the Anhui area, the association yesterday sent another telegram to the National Government and the Ministry of Finance, clearly ordering the abolition of the surtax to avoid incidents and resolve disputes.</p>
<p>Post Office Suspends Sending Packages and Money Orders to Xidun</p>
<p>According to news from the Shanghai Post Office, due to the current unstable situation and traffic congestion, all package and money order services to the Xidun Post Office have been temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>Rice Merchant Yao Zixi Dies</p>
<p>Yao Zixi, a rice industry elder, was diligent, thrifty, and enthusiastic about public welfare, and can be considered a model for the world. He was over 80 years old and still in good health. Recently, he passed away suddenly due to a minor illness on March 23rd. The rice industry has deeply regretted his passing. It is said that the funeral is scheduled for April 6th, and the family memorial service will be held on May 3rd.</p>
<p>Litigants in War Zones Should Report Their Addresses</p>
<p>The Shanghai Local Court has jurisdiction over six townships, including Zhabei, Pengpu, Yinhang, Jiangwan, Wusong, and Zhenru. During the recent war, people were displaced and their addresses were unknown. As a result, unresolved civil and criminal lawsuits from the past have been stalled and cannot be concluded. It is difficult to contact them. Therefore, the court issued a notice yesterday that litigants within the court's jurisdiction who have changed their addresses due to the war, or the addresses of related parties and witnesses, should submit a statement within ten days to facilitate litigation. At the same time, the court will publish a notice in the newspaper for everyone to be informed.</p>
<p>County Government Proclaims Abolition of Bad Qingming Customs</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government recently received a report from the first district of Minhang stating that, according to investigations, the custom of people visiting graves and worshiping ancestors during the Qingming Festival is a filial piety that should be observed by descendants. However, burning grass and paper money wastes useful money, which is not a way to save money. In addition, relatives and friends visit each other, and the expenses for eating and drinking are even more considerable. At a time when difficulties are becoming more urgent and people's livelihoods are declining, all citizens should abolish bad customs and advocate thrift. Such extravagance should not be allowed to exist and harm the people. After receiving the report, Strict Magistrate, in addition to issuing an order to all district chiefs and public security sub-bureau chiefs to follow the ban yesterday, also issued a proclamation to the people of the county to encourage each other to abolish the custom.</p>
<p>Yingchang Factory Suspends Production Due to Lack of Raw Materials</p>
<p>The Dachina Yingchang Match Factory in Lujiazui, Pudong, announced the suspension of production and laid off workers due to the impact of the Shanghai War. The reasons for the suspension of production were published in a previous report. Yesterday, labor and management representatives Wu Shijing and Xie Yutong, among others, stated the reasons for the suspension of production as follows: "Since the January 28th Shanghai Incident, the management decided to completely shut down the factory to avoid danger. The workers have had difficulty making a living and have been receiving 6 yuan for food each month, with female workers receiving half that amount, paid every half month. Because there is no resolution date for the war and raw materials are lacking, labor and management have reached a consensus on a long-term shutdown. The food allowance will be paid until the end of March and workers will be given an additional 12 yuan each, plus the 3 yuan for the second half of March, for a total of 15 yuan. Female workers will be given half that amount. The factory has more than 2,000 workers, and two-thirds have already been paid. One-third of the workers who live far away have not yet come to collect their payments. It is reported that the factory plans to close down in April and has informed everyone."</p>

<p>National Salvation United Association</p>
<h3>Two Conditions for Market Reopening</h3>
<p>Entertainment venues should have considerable improvements</p>
<p>All industries should contribute to military funding</p>
<p>The National Salvation United Association of various groups expressed its support for the reopening of the market, but with attached conditions. It sent a letter to the city chamber of commerce and other groups, offering the following suggestions: "Respectfully, this association previously resolved to go on strike to resist the enemy and notified your association. Before the Japanese troops withdraw from Shanghai, we should persevere to the end to show our determination to resist. However, the Japanese invaders are ambitious and have no sincerity in peaceful negotiations. The Shanghai issue cannot be resolved in a short time. We must have a complete plan for long-term resistance. Considering that the strike in this port has lasted for two months, the losses are huge. If this continues, it will have an impact on the national economy and people's livelihood. After deliberation by the council of this association, it was decided that the competent groups should consider the situation and reopen the market on a regular basis to maintain commerce. However, after the reopening of the market, the following indispensable requirements are as follows: (1) All entertainment venues should have been absolutely prohibited from operating during this period. Now, in order to take care of the livelihood of the workers, special accommodation is given, but all kinds of spoken drama, opera, Shanghai opera, and storytelling should be changed into costume lectures. Peking opera should not be performed except for tragic and exciting historical dramas. All kinds of dramas should be reduced as much as possible. The methods of reforming music should be discussed and handled by personnel from relevant institutions. Dance halls and dog racing venues should be absolutely prohibited. (2) The percentage ratio of tax donations for military funding in various industries in this city should be determined to show support for military affairs." These resolutions have been recorded. In addition to sending separate letters to the relevant groups, this letter is specifically sent for your reference. Sincerely, Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Shanghai Citizens' Federation, Shanghai Simalu Business Federation, Actors' Union, Shanghai National Salvation United Association, March 27th.</p>
<p>Real Estate Association</p>
<h3>Discussion of Rent Collection Issues Today</h3>
<p>The issue of post-war rent in this city has attracted much attention from all walks of life. More than seventy groups have gathered to form the Shanghai Citizens' Rent Reduction Movement Committee, and are soliciting opinions from various groups and citizens in order to formulate rent reduction requests and reduce the burden on citizens. The Real Estate Association has scheduled a meeting at 2 p.m. today at its office on Beijing Road to discuss measures for rent collection in the war zone and its vicinity.</p>
<h3>Rent Reduction Movement in Various Circles</h3>
<p>(West Shanghai) Citizens in West Shanghai held a meeting of representatives from various neighborhoods yesterday, with more than sixty representatives attending. Zhu Yan was elected chairman and Zhu Ran recorded the minutes. After deliberation by the whole body, it was resolved that: (1) Tenants should be notified to register with the association. (2) Subtenants and third tenants should be treated equally. (3) A petition should be submitted to the authorities, asking them to sympathize with the huge losses suffered by citizens and issue a clear order to reduce rents. (4) All group schools or private houses that have accommodated refugees or have been occupied by Japanese soldiers or have been destroyed by artillery fire or bombs should be exempt from rent. (5) A letter should be sent to the Real Estate Association to inform the landlords that tenants who are in arrears with rent during the war period should not be deliberately threatened or forced to move. (6) Chen Ruilin, Shen Yong, and Yang Changchi, lawyers, should be hired as legal advisors to handle rent disputes. (7) Zhu Yan, Zhu Ran, Wu Fulin, Wu Songquan, Shen Shuren, Qin Linsheng, Zhu Shaowu, Yu Zhirong, and other fifteen people should be elected as members to be responsible for issuing declarations, and No. 113 Xinkang Lane, Kangnuo Road, should be designated as the office.</p>
<p>Nine Acres of Land The Nine Acres of Land Tenants' Association in this city was established in the 15th year of the Republic of China. Now, due to the Japanese army's invasion of the Central Plains, all industries have stagnated, and the losses are immeasurable. Tenants in various alleys and lanes are really unable to bear the rent. Therefore, a declaration is issued, saying, "Since the violent Japanese disaster in China, half a year has passed. They have invaded our Eastern Provinces and trampled on our Shanghai. Wherever their iron hooves have gone, houses have been turned into ruins. Although the residents of our Nine Acres of Land have not been directly devastated, the indirect losses are enormous. At this time of national crisis, all industries have stagnated, violence is increasing, and peace is difficult to hope for. How can our residents bear the huge rent again? Therefore, it is resolved that before the war is over, we should ask the landlords to sympathize with the difficulties of the times and exempt all rent to relieve the people's plight. The responsibility of this association lies in taking the tenants' intentions as our own and doing our best to realize them. If there is anyone who violates this agreement, this association will do its best to deal with them. We hope that the landlords will uphold the spirit of riding the same boat and sacrifice a little of their current income to lighten the burden on the tenants. I believe that all the landlords are enlightened people and will definitely express their sympathy for this kind of unavoidable request. This is the declaration." It is also reported that the association is currently handling membership registration matters. If there are residents who have not joined the association, they can go to the association's office (No. 79 Luxiangyuan Road, Nine Acres of Land) to register and join the association.</p>
<p>National Salvation Society The National Salvation Society of the Republic of China sent a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce on the 27th of this month, proposing two measures for rent reduction: (1) Following the precedent of rent reduction by the Nanjing Chamber of Commerce, those who rented or increased rent from the 16th to the 18th year should receive an 80% discount, those after the 18th year should receive a 60% discount, and those before the 16th year should not be reduced. (2) The date of rent reduction should be calculated from the date of the Shanghai Incident (January 28th) until the date when the Shanghai Incident is resolved and the market recovers.</p>
<p>[National Crisis Period&gt;</p>
<h3>Repercussions of Landlord's Forced Eviction</h3>
<p>The houses in the East and West Huifang Lane area of Simalu have recently been forced to move out by the landlord, Chinese Sun Bosheng, who disregarded the difficulties of the current situation, on the pretext of renovation, which caused a backlash from all the tenants. Therefore, yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m., all the tenants held a meeting at the Simalu Business Federation to discuss the matter. Representatives from Xinqun Wang Hengtang, Zhong Huanxiang, Xin Dazhong Ye Shiqiao, Luming, Li Yousheng, Xin Dahua Huang Zijue, as well as Lao Dahua, Shangxian Hotel, Xin Zhongyang, Hengfeng Shou, Gu Qianhe, Mo Ji, Jin Wentang, Baixin, Qunxueshe, Wenhua, Xu Shengji, Qianchang, and other ten companies attended, and the Simalu Business Federation sent member Zhu Yadao to attend. After discussing countermeasures, Li Yousheng was elected chairman to report on the purpose of the meeting and the situation of the landlord's oppression. The following countermeasures were resolved: (1) The lane should organize a tenants' union to deal with the landlord's illegal oppression and consolidate the tenants' solidarity. (2) The landlord's lawyer Cai Rudong's order to move out within three days was unanimously rejected, and a letter was sent in reply. (3) It is extremely difficult to move during this national crisis period of commercial depression. All the tenants publicly requested lawyer Jiang Yiping to be their legal advisor to protect them according to law. (4) A declaration was issued on the landlord's unreasonable forced eviction and illegal oppression, requesting assistance from all walks of life. (5) Responsible members and tenants were appointed to bear all expenses. After the meeting, it was adjourned.</p>
<h3>Scout Battlefield Service Corps Arrives at the Front</h3>
<p>Seventy-six members of the fourth batch</p>
<p>According to various newspapers, the fourth batch of seventy-six members of the Shanghai Boy Scout Battlefield Service Corps arrived at the front on the 27th. The battlefield service boy scouts greeted them everywhere they passed. Wang Gang, the commander of the corps, also went to the front to direct the operations at any time. It is also learned that 156 boy scouts working at the front have arrived one after another. Director Tang and Secretary Zhou of the 囗囗 Office came to give instructions on the same day.</p>
<h3>Depressed Scene in West Shanghai</h3>
<p>The area of Caojiadu and Fanhangdu in West Shanghai is located south of the Suzhou River, separated from the Zhabei war zone by only one river. During the fierce fighting, stray bullets flew everywhere, and general businesses and residents moved away one after another. Although the construction of roads beyond the boundary was strictly prevented by Italian soldiers and police officers of the Sixth District, it did not affect them. However, all factories were shut down and businesses were closed. In addition, refugees from all over flocked here, resulting in extreme market depression. Although the war has stopped and a ceasefire conference is being held, although Chinese factories and factories in the area have resumed business and started work, the shops on the roads are still tightly closed. Even those who operate with both doors open are only a few food stores, just to meet the market. Moreover, refugees from Huangdu, Qingpu, Jiading, and other places continue to come every day, so the residents who have moved out dare not go home rashly, resulting in few pedestrians on the roads and an unusually cold atmosphere. In the evening, there are almost no pedestrians.</p>
<h3>Depressed Market in Hongkou</h3>
<p>Japanese persuasion to resume business is ineffective</p>
<p>There is no obstruction in Hongkou, but the market situation is still depressed. Only one or two out of ten shops have resumed business. The Japanese headquarters has posted notices everywhere, advising merchants and civilians to resume business, but Chinese merchants are afraid of harassment by Japanese soldiers and dare not operate as usual. Since yesterday, the Japanese headquarters has sent people to the Wusong Road and Qiujiang Road area to verbally advise merchants to open their businesses, but most of them ignored them.</p>
