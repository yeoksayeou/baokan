<h3>白魯寗發表宣言後</h3>
<h3>英法態度異趣</h3>
<p>洛桑會議</p>
<p>麥唐納認爲愈有召集必要</p>
<p>取銷賠欵</p>
<p>法人謂不贊宣布條約無效</p>
<p>▲路透社十日倫敦電德總理白魯寗所發德國不能繼續償付政治賠欵之宣言、已引起英乎麥唐納之答復、今晚英相發出一文、謂渠信有關係各國政府皆知歐洲之恢復、繫於艱難事實之應付、英政府之政策與意見、僅可在適當地點與時間宣佈之、但有可言者、觀於德國内部政治難題、與國際專家報告所披露之情形、吾人早料在洛桑賠欵會議中、德國必有如今日白魯寗所發者之宣言、今此宣言已於開會以前發表矣、賠欵大會乃愈有舉行之必要、蓋現狀乃國際恊定所產生者、應由國際會議處理之、不能置諸不問也云、英相見解、顯與巴黎政界所抱者不同、法人以爲德國担付賠欵之决議、已使洛桑會議成爲無益之舉、德總理之宣言、無異宣佈德國欲取銷楊格計晝與凡爾賽和約也、</p>
<p>▲路透社十一日倫敦電今日倫敦一般輿論對於德總理之重要宣言、認爲以外交手腕剖開凡爾賽和約之大作、如德不付賠欵、則法英皆將不能償付、美國財政糾紛勢必發生、說者謂苟若是、焉知非福、蓋執政者處此、將有抺除一切戰債與賠欵、而永免世界苦楚之機會矣、美國國會近曾通過議案、反對歐洲戰債之减少、但許多美人確贊同美國某重要銀行家所發歐洲債欵取銷、則貿昜必盛、美國所獲將遽遇其所失之見解、然取銷非美名也、今日英法報紙評論多數不喜據總理宣言之物質輿形式、英國金融時報稱、如賠欵全部結構必須摧毁、則非因德國在道德上有應予解放之理由、但因索取賠償之任何舉動、將使其債權者受害耳云、若德國果停付賠欵、則意國將無所失、亦無所得、故意政府對於白魯寗之宣言、尙未有表示、法國將每年喪失二千一百萬鎊、英國喪失一千一百萬鎊、英法兩國對於此點、意見大異、法人借輿德國之短期借欵、爲數甚微、以故爲賠欵應超過商債、而英國則謂商債應與賠欵處於同等地位、總之、如短期借欵之商債、在胡佛緩付時期終了前四個月即將滿期、如債權人必欲德國償付、則德國將陷於完全不能償付法國賠欵之地位、</p>
<p>▲國民十一日柏林電自德總理白魯寗對於賠欵問題發無力再繳宣言後、世界頓起反響、德政界遂現緊張之態、迨昨夜英相麥唐納作坦直宣言、認目前事態不能聽其自然、而白魯寗之宣言亦非全出意外、德政界始爲之大慰、現以法國某半官通訊社巴黎消息稱、法政府亦無向國際法庭陳訴意、如一部份報紙所主張者、又謂法内閣將於明日討論白魯寗宣言、但無論如何定將出席洛桑會議云云、因此德政界對於賠欵問題、國際解决希望業已復活、</p>

<h3>駐日美使辭職不確</h3>
<p>▲國民十一日東京電頃據美國駐日大使館、探得消息、美國駐日大使福白士并無辭職返國之意、外間所傅福氏擬請辭職一說、實毫無根據云、美大使館人員對於外傅福白士與本國國務院意見相左之謡言、亦竭力否認、惟福白士對於在東京之任務、確常認爲並非永久性、故亦甚願及時卸任返國、彼來此之前、曾加以深長之孝慮、後以盡力國家、不獲堅持、遂毅然赴任、彼能否於本年内退職返國、尙未可知、但必須俟目下嚴重之時局告一段落、始能成行也再則福白士與本國國務院主面意見素屬融洽、即對於中日問題亦抱同一之見解、故外間所云意見相左之說、不知何自而來者云、</p>

<h3>錦州撤防之眞相</h3>
<p>錦州撤防、關係重大、記者曾親赴秦皇島山海關各地、冷眼視察、及多方探索、所得情形、與外間傅述及各報記載、稍有出入、特摘要記之於下、</p>
<p>記者於二十九日到天津、津報多載前線之如何激戰、而一方則微聞東北主力軍已在撤退中、三十日晨急赴前方、路過塘沽、同車中有日軍之演習者、蓋天津日軍已逹三千人、不時四出演習、其目的則在防止我軍之戰事設備也、大連天津之海上交通、入冬以來、以塘沽爲口岸、日本增兵天津、須由塘沽藉火車運輸、所以天津塘沽間日兵往來、絡繹不絕、日軍向例、乘車只納半價而且記賬、不納現欵、聞日軍積欠北寗路運價已逹百餘萬元之鉅、過秦皇島車停時、見車站上有房屋一座、約有四間滿駐日兵、一日兵立於門前、係守衞性質門内並立三日兵、一則手握電話機、不斷的說話諒、係報告列車往來情况於其上峯也、秦皇島泊有日本軍艦四艘、其中一艘旋開往山海關、山海關原泊有日本軍盤三艘、航空母艦一艘、三十一日則又增加軍盤一艘、即自秦皇島開來者、山海關以辛丑條約關係、原駐有日本守備隊百人左右、近已增至二百餘人、該隊駐防地、電綱戰壕十分完備、且聞早挖有地道、現已通至何處、不得而知、山海關並有意大利及法國駐軍、惟人數不多、</p>
<p>山海關係獨立第九旅駐防、旅長爲何柱國、何係廣西人、畢業於日本士官學校、記者曾投剌往謁、嘗蒙接見、何對於日本侵略東北歷史、及東北重要問題、如鐵路商租權等、均瞭如指掌、詢以軍事計劃、則大聲歎息、謂軍人職在守土衞國、如日軍來犯、彼必誓死抵抗、惟若錦州不守、則山海關險與敵共、彼實不昜爲力、至必要時、惟有一死報國而已、</p>
<p>山海關距海岸僅數里、日本軍艦砲火、可直逹該地而有餘、臨海無山、抵禦海軍絕無方法、而且日方原駐有守備隊、加以航空母盤即泊此處、海陸空交相爲用、以少數兵力、（何旅共有萬人、而分駐蘆台榆</p>
<p>關問北寗鐵路沿線各地、）何能對抗、所以榆關早非我有、今之守與不守、無甚關係、誠難乎其爲何旅也、</p>
<p>山海關向爲東北之門戶、國人皆知其險要、然以山勢外延、欲入關則甚難、今則日軍自東而西險爲人據、山海關直無險可守、且不特山海關無險可守也、即山海關以西各地、亦復如是、蓋北寗鐵路依海岸而行、沿途又黨崇山峻嶺、爲之掩護、隨地在日軍艦砲火威脅之下、我將何以自存、所以錦州不守、平津胥在日人掌握之中、北寗路之建築、當年即絕未慮及國防計晝、加以辛丑條約允拆去大沽砲臺、及允外人在沿線各地屯駐軍隊、與運輸軍隊、鳴呼此可謂獨立國家耶我國軍事當局惟忙於内戰、忽視國防、竟至於是、山海關以東、綏中興城錦州諸地、左右皆山、爲日本海軍力所不及、不難固守、記者曾晤及錦州臨時省政府之官吏、據云錦州前之戰壕、早已竣工、所備之戰事材料、亦頗充足、扼要以守、至少可支持兩月按駐錦州一帶之軍隊除第十二旅十九旅二十旅外、尙有警備騎兵旅敎導隊便衣隊等、總計不下五萬人、縱溝帮子失守、大虎山亦不保、退而至二錦州、當可肉搏一時、萬一錦州亦失陷、而興城綏中、均有險可守、而且義勇軍已篇起東省内地、大可擾亂日軍後方、日軍縱萬能、决非二三月内所能消滅我軍、抵逹榆關、與其海軍聯絡一氣、何况當日軍發動侵錦之際、英美法已向日本警告、相持日久、國際形勢必更起變化、安見日軍之能操勝算哉、今則榆關以東、皆在日軍佔領之下、榆關以西又無險可守、不啻爲日軍防區、國人尙有要求政府以武力收復失地者、吾不知其將何由而入東省、如何運輸軍隊與軍器也、</p>
<p>據各通訊社所傅、似日軍攻擊錦州之際、我軍曾與之激戰、卒以力不能支而退、而以愚所聞、則與日軍相抗者、乃爲民國學生退伍軍人及［馬賊］混合組織之義勇軍、至東北正式軍隊、則固未餉日軍一彈、而係自動的撤退也、當日軍發動攻錦之際、報載榮臻由錦返平、默無一言、旋入恊和醫院就醫、其時張學良正與日本交涉、日方允到大凌河（錦州東一車站）爲止、東北車撤至關内、錦州省政府任其存在、蓋即無形中實現所謂中立區也、榮臻當即返錦、令各軍撤往關内、縣昌黎間第十二旅于二十九日先行撤退、繼之爲第二十旅與第十九旅、各旅均于三十一日撤至關内榮臻專車於一日下午抵灤當開始撤退之際、日軍主力尙在新民、旋即追踪而至、赿錦州而趨山海關、其泊渤海（山海關附近）之航空母艦、則送出飛機以迫山海關、而迎日軍之前進、錦州之東北邊防軍行署全部人員、均于三十一日離錦、而臨時省政府亦于以無形消滅、東北當局始終抱定不抵抗主義、吾不知其用心果安在也、（一月七日發于天津）</p>
<h3>北寗路之通車問題</h3>
<p>天津通信、北寗鐵路、自九一八日軍入寇後、關外各段、即迭受日軍之摧殘、路產破壞、員工傷亡、公私損失、難以數計、而内外員工仍抱日折不撓之精神、冒萬險、排萬難、克盡維持交通之責、國省機關在關外已被日軍掃蕩無餘、東北人民賴以與内地互通聲氣者、惟有一北寗鐵路耳、該路自事變以來、關外段客車、從未有停頓在一日以上者、故消息較爲靈通、其於交通上功績亦甚偉大、但自錦州我軍撤退後、所有關外幹路員工失其保障、感於日軍之威逼、不得不暫時避去、遂作有秩序之撤退、而大站仍留少數之重要職員駐守、不過因日本軍事行動關係、期前開去之客車四列、未得開回嗣以我軍業已全數退入關内、而日軍亦進至山海關外第一站萬家屯爲止、數日以來漸見平靜、路局方面急於謀通車恢復、遂派前駐瀋辦事處長胡純讚、率原有各段站員工、由山海關於一月五日東去、行至興城、晤該處日軍司令官、交涉通車辦法、該司令官聲稱、伊祇負軍事上責任、關於通車之事、須向現在奉天交通委員商量、（按</p>
<p>瀋陽原設有東北交通委員會、九一八後即移北平、現在之爲交通委員會、係由日人操縱下所指派之委員組織而成、委員長爲丁鑑修、）胡氏即將此結果報失天津總局、同時總局又接到該路運鑑處長英人史梯理自瀋陽來電、聲稱全路通車事已無問題、但據駐瀋日本領事表示、須與此處新政府商榷後方可施行、路局接到此二報告後、因此中有賣國之僞交通委員會從中作梗、全路通車日内恐不昜實現、而該路有中英公司借欵關係、故中英公司所派常川駐路之代表、即現任該路曾計處長英人唐森·恊同工務處長英人李治於一月八日由津去平、往晤英公使藍浦森、商酌解决通車問題、或將請示該議政府核辦、據最近可靠消息、現日人操縱下之僞交通委員欲仿照前例、將關外一段、改稱山奉路、（即由山海關至</p>
<p>奉天之謂）由該會管理、局長一職已派定闞鐸、闞氏前曾充膠濟鐵路局長、此說果成事實、北寗路之通車問題、當更不昜解决矣、（一月九日）</p>

<h3>曁南復前仇馬來再遭失敗</h3>
<p>▲二比零　　全局沉悶</p>
<p>▲下半局　　不分勝負</p>
<p>明日馬來戰英陸軍聯隊</p>
<p>馬來亞華僑足球隊、昨日以二比零再敗於曁南大學、於中華棒球塲、觀者三四千人、星期日劇戰東華之後、不無稍受影響也、馬來前度來滬、以三比○戰勝、曁南以二比○還敬、羣日曁南復仇、昨日局勢、完全盛於曁南、上半時陳鎭和丘東炎各中一球、下半時陳丘足傷出、馬來亦有傷者、於是局勢更趨沉悶矣、裁判蔣湘青、明日下午、馬來在原地再戰英陸軍聯合隊、</p>
<p>▲曁南陣線</p>
<p>陳部章　　顧尙勸　　江善敬　　梁樹棠　馮運佑　陳福忠符和萱　丘東炎　江宗綿　陳鎭和（下）　楊保森　温鼎新（下）梅洪實</p>
<p>▲馬來陣線</p>
<p>黄錦柏　　許錦堂·余焯厚　甘金祿　簡德耀　黄克厚劉金融　關信念　　謝金福　　鄧悅雲　夏海山</p>
<p>▲局勢沉悶</p>
<p>馬來始終屈服、前鋒得球之機會、難得之至、曁南上半時、時時圍攻馬來之門、下二時曁南二人將陳鎭和丘東災、相繼出、馬來乃得有進攻機會、最後雙方俱作無目的攻射、以丁戰局、</p>
<p>▲守門風頭</p>
<p>此種形勢之下、最出風頭當推球門、馬來守門黄錦柏、逆來順受、上撲下接、前衝後守、表演確有把握、備受觀者讚賞、稱之鐵門、當亦無愧、　　▲中線太弱</p>
<p>馬來之敗、天寒影響、活動力大减、而中衛線、太形軟弱、不容諱蔽、致使敵人得東西進逼、而中堅之不能接濟前方前、鋒之不一致行進、傅球無方向把握均影響實力之大病也、</p>
<p>▲曁南威逼</p>
<p>曁南操縱全局、得意之至、而中後陣線之更動、並未影響實力顧尙勸之後衞、穏健可取、馮運佑之中堅、亦曾屢次攻門、大有軋許色彩、馬來守門大張、以豐由屢攻無幾、否則當爲大勝之局其線　人俱甚稱職、</p>
<p>▲陳丘連進</p>
<p>佈陣爭球曁南即敢攻勢兵臨城下、一而再、惟以鐵門當前、屢攻不入、將十分鐘、梅洪賣在右方直進、將進右角、勾起傅中、陳鎭和將起攻門、馬來左衞許錦堂、見勢不佳鐵之出界、符和豐角球甚佳、陳鎭和順其來勢、在門左五碼地、平球向下猛射、球力過大、黄錦柏蹲下、接得而仍彈入門角、一比零先分勝負、再十分鐘、丘東災在離門十五碼、正中遼射、隔光耀目再度破關曁南上半時、即以此二比零告勝、</p>
<p>▲大將中傷</p>

<h3>軍閥的鏡子</h3>
<p>何君應欽新近演講中國國民革命到如今只算是打倒了軍閥，完成了革命的第一個階段。</p>
<p>我們要向何君問一問··</p>
<p>那幾個軍閥已打倒？</p>
<p>那幾個革閥復活了？</p>
<p>那幾個革命軍人變軍閥？</p>
<p>要想對這些問題給一個水落石出的答案必先說明軍閥是什麽。且讓我下一個定義吧！</p>
<p>［壓倒主人自作主，</p>
<p>揮霍兵餉如糞土·</p>
<p>强盜進門不抵抗，</p>
<p>主人趕賊他不許。］</p>
<p>這是一面檢騐軍閥的鏡子。每一個軍人只要拿這鏡子把自已的行動比一比便知道自已是不是軍閥？我們要知道國民革命與軍閥之消息長，只消拿這面鏡子對着全國的軍人照一照，便能一目了然。</p>
<h3>西施考眞</h3>
<p>— 一臧</p>
<p>予弟一超。前供職曁陽縣府。日前來滬。爲余談西施事頗詳。爰泚筆記之。以餉閲者。西施本名鄭旦。法名采蘋。史名夷光。西施其號也。父姓鄭。名洛。字赿民。母姓施。父爲曁陽縣城外若耶溪夢山山陽施家村施氏之贅婿。村在溪之西。故名日西施。村即苧蘿村也。因生長母家。故號日西施。溪即浣紗溪。以西施浣紗而命名。是溪今名日浣江。說者有誤鄭旦是東施之名。實則東施並無其人。係後世好事者所揑造。聞西施之貎。亦不甚美惟圓面紅色。不施脂粉。已同於衆人之粉飾。當十七歲時。浣紗若耶溪時。適范蠡爲赿王覓美人。見溪畔一女郎。窈窕秀弱。風致嫣然。蠡即隨至其家。得父母許。將獻越王。初西施尙不屑爲他國君王妾。旋因激於范蠡之勸始去。時越王報仇心切。告之日。子能爲孤報仇乎。孤自爲吳挫敗以來。苦心焦思。臥薪嘗膽。無計可施。今日非子不能爲吾雪恥重振福稷也。言訖。涙如泉湧。西施伏地泣日。倘有用妾之處。萬死不辭。望即獻妾於吳。妾若不報吳仇。寗死於萬刃之下。翌日。越王送至吳宫。吳王大悅。不視國事。迨至越王二十二年。一戰敗吳。西施即歸越至家。年已三十六。父已早亡。惟有母在。家仍貧困。後母卒。痛不欲生。將自盡於浣溪。未果。尋至錢塘江畔。乘隙投江而逝。時年五十有二。而世人有謂其不返故里。或謂其自盡浣溪。或謂爲吳人沈於江者。皆非也。降及漢代追封爲救國眞人。今其族人已遷蕭山。而舊址已燬滅無遺。惟考曁陽志中。載有明王季游苧蘿山時在石壁上題斗大浣溪二字。傅是王右軍筆。但亦　殘。不可辨識。至清末葉曁陽人陳蔚文醵資在遺跡之東。拓地十餘畝。建浣溪亭。亭旁又立西子廟。廟後有紅粉池。凡游人過此。莫不唏嘘感懐焉。</p>
<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>法蘭西需要麻雀法蘭西有好多地方都愛吃麻雀。認爲一種美味。正與我國蘇滬一帶以麻雀列入酒席一樣因此麻雀在法蘭西極爲需要。全國的麻雀幾乎都不能保全性命。幸而生生不息。常能飽他們口腹之慾。不道去年這年頭兒。不知怎樣流行了一種瘟病。將大半的麻雀都給瘟死了。於是法蘭西人食指雖動。都苦的没有麻雀可吃事有凑巧。匈牙利却偏偏麻雀極多。一般失業的人。便以捉麻雀爲生。捉到了麻雀。活活的運到法蘭西。就在那邊殺了出賣。據說他們捉麻雀的方法。是先用一種水槍將水射上去。使麻雀嚇呆了。然後把帽子或手帕掩捉。百無一失。捉得之後。零零碎碎的賣與當地野味店。每頭可得半便士。因爲法蘭西方面銷路極暢。所以大可維持匈牙利一部分的失業者的生活。</p>
<h3>小消息</h3>
<p>— 榮</p>
<p>老民黨沈佩貞女士。前因乳痛來滬。經濟困難。無法就醫。幸由粤南馮君担任醫費。在楊樹浦寗國路聖心醫院醫治數月。所費甚鉅。復經鄭毓秀律師資助欵項。卒以病入膏盲。於一月五日在院去世。無以爲殮。經滬紳王一亭君購材成殮。暫厝閘北湖州會館。連日由其内侄沈世雄向各方泣求資助。以便運柩回里。沈爲革命鉅子。如此收塲。甚可慨也。</p>
<h3>傷風</h3>
<p>— 秋水</p>
<p>在我們的心目中。認爲最輕小而最多的毛病。就是傷風。然而這在歐美各國。却剛剛相反。他們對於傷風一症。十分重視。一遇鼻塞作咳。必須就醫服藥。不敢疏忽。其理由就因爲傷風爲肺病之先兆。若非早治。必有後患之故。而醫學界對於傷風之治療方法。迄今尙無對症之藥。若不於初起時。趕緊治療。日後就不易斷根。因爲人們爲什麽澮傷風。傷風之病菌何在。久已爲歐美醫學家一個繁難的問題。</p>
<p>然據最近的消息。則謂傷風病菌。業已發現。發現爲何人。尙不可考。所可知者。即其病菌之體積。渺小異常。能自由出入於醫家所用最精密之濾水器。且爲顯微鏡所不易窺見者。</p>
<p>然萬能之科學家。並不因此而捨棄其工作。曾多方設法。取得此種病菌若干。加以詳密之試騐。試騐完畢之後。並以注射於猩猩及人體之中。以偵察其醖釀繁殖之現象。吾知不數年後。治療傷風。將有一對症之藥料。而戲園茶寮之中。亦將不復聞狂咳嘔痰之聲矣。科學之造福於人類。豈淺鮮哉。</p>
<p>傷風之爲害於人類康健。醫家類能道之。然此尙爲其直接的損害而已。人之因傷風而失康健。對於國家。對於社會。間接之損失尤大。數年前。有美國某社會學家。曾賽地考察。公布一全國工人因傷風而輟工之損失表。一年之内其工資損失額乃至二萬萬金鎊。殊駭人也。我國人其注意之。而今而後毋以傷風爲小疾。而諱言醫藥。</p>
<h3>故都聞見錄</h3>
<p>— 銖菴</p>
<p>▲玩具</p>
<p>故都東西兩寺廟會及東安市塲以至新春廠肆等處。最能吸引游人者。惟小兒現具。浮灘列肆。層見疊出。皆是物也。嘗見故宫有宋錢舜舉所繪貨擔圖。婦人牽引小兒。聚觀爭購。正是此景。欲研究民間風欲者。舍此無所之矣。約而舉之。有非他處所習見者數事焉。一日抖空鐘。燕京雜記所謂裁竹爲二短筒。中作小幹。連而不斷。實其兩頭。竅其中間。以繩繞其小幹。引兩端而抖擻之。聲如洪鐘。甚爲可聽也。工於此技者。能抛至半空。重復落下。而聲仍不絕。或兩手分張。引繩使直。而空鐘自左至右。飄忽往來。絕不著力。亦不墜地。號日仙人過橋。爲賣藝者一種技衞。市井小兒多習爲之。一日牛剌八。以玻璃作葫蘆形。口銜其管。遞爲呼吸。其底震蕩有聲。然稍不經意即昜破裂。新春敝肆多賣此物。一日揑江米人。以鐵絲爲胎。據糯米紛染諸彩色。爲戲劇中人物之象。大不逾二三寸。鬚眉劍戟。織悉畢肖。純以手成。不假他物。誠爲絕藝。北語燸米爲江米。故云。一日財神鞭。以糖漬山查果貫作長鞭。修至三四尺。亦以歲首貨之兒童。美其名日財神鞭。以悅婦稚。旣不可口。亦無可玩。一日彈弓。以堅木被牛革作弩。中貯泥彈。引而發之。可以斃鳥雀。殆即韓嫣金彈之遺製玩具者。類皆旗民。平日薄有才智而無恒業。乃出其餘技引申變化以爲　口之資。多有儇巧可喜。出人意表。嘗游市塲見以口令呼兩蟲相鬥者。初意其訓練之精若此。當售價不貲。迫而察之。始知其爲僞物。而以絕細之髮引之。暗藏其髮於袖中耳。玩具旣日新月異。索價復賤。生涯殊不惡。惜多不能持久。無由運售他處也。</p>
<h3>戎馬雙樓記（七）</h3>
<p>— 求幸福齊主人</p>
<p>第一回　絕代名倡索居懐美眷　異鄉學子浪跡締奇緣平日若是家居燕息。并也想到自身學問上的修養。曾聘請了兩三位敎育界中的名敎授。每天按鐘點上伊家來。敎伊讀書習字。連對外交際上所必需的英文英語。也在學著。伊小時候原在初等小學畢過業。字墨本有點小根柢。再憑伊那樣聰慧去精勤習練。進步就斐然可觀。中文是勉强能應付普通書札和瀏覽報紙。英文也琅琅上口。隨處賣弄。還有更有羡的。一筆黄山谷的大字。寫得挻拔奇秀。人人稱讚。幾乎成功一位女書家。祇是這些嘴邊和紙上本領。除了浪得虚名以外。仍於伊没有何種的益處。因爲伊本就很有名的。徒徒再加上一些風雅文明的榮銜。實際上却作不了用。旣未能憑這些皮毛上的玩藝。就做得出何種出人頭地的事業。便赿發變成個徒有其表的骨董。高不成低不就的擱淺在中間。幸而另有一椿。爲了附庸風雅。接近名流。得與各學府中一般青年優秀學子往來。伊就趁機會打好了個主意。欲在這些天眞純潔的學生裹面。慢慢物色一位德智體三育俱有根基的青年。實行伊向來所抱負的擇偶相夫的計晝。先用愛情去感化。繼以手段去訓練。再次則將金錢謀略來培植。料總可以親手製造成功一個有爲有守的好丈夫來。逹到伊終身莫大的期望。是這樣留心了些時。果然天從人願。就有一個資格很相符的學生。落在伊的手中。供伊試騐。這人姓安名玉田。祖居在外省處山林險阻民風强悍的地方。聚有族衆。建了一座赫赫有名的安家寨。他父親就是這安家寨的村長。在寨裹有一爿堅固寬大的住宅。和兩家商號。并擁有良田十餘頃。不愧爲地方上的富戶。安玉田是家裹一個獨子。很得父母的憐愛。所以他父母希望將他培植成學富資深的克家令子。自小兒就肯供給他到外地就學。爲著家鄉風氣閉塞。受不著良好高深的敎育。别要躭誤了他的學業。從高小以至高中。他都是在省城中著名的省校畢業的。上年因昇學問題。聽說只有北京的大學辦得最出名。才負笈北來。攷入一隻大學。專修法政一科。現今已是冠禮初成。二十一歲的壯男了。長成英資挺發。一表人才。有崢嶸的頭角。炯炯目光。挿鬚的雙眉。豐頣的面相。鮮潤的血色。寬廣的肩膊。一見而知是個剛强健壯的體質。歷來在學校中運動會塲上。久以十項全能出名。其餘各項學程。也無不造詣頗深。鮮落人後。可算是一名高材生。</p>

<h3>糧令　河下米市轉疲</h3>
<p>▲滬南　昨日來源約二十餘號、本城店銷因天晴、主顧稀少、去路頂貨還可、中關平淡、厚粳行情暫告平定薄稻到積稍有寜胃擯塞本街去路揀中段略辦、次色微細、滬洋尖積貨雖告零落、但受洋米價廉、市居平庸、</p>
<p>▲新閘　市情難以活動、各店號臨市者雖屬踴躍、售盤示見平穏且有看鬆之象、客尖裝到二車、成益振興二家續辦厚薄粳及洋埠尖去胃不健、價小角許、變陰元隨到隨銷、價與前盤和仿、昨由太古公司裝到小絞米六千包、開盤已降低二角、</p>
<h3>洋米期現均軟</h3>
<p>昨日洋米市况、又見疲落之象、因洋行續有抛意、而本街胃口已飽、本街現銷雖活潑、然有大批續到、貨主以年關在涵、大部分均主急脫、因此市價又小一二角、期貨新交昜停頓、回籠貨亦居軟象、統市開出小絞現米一千二百包、價九元半、一號西貢一千包、價十元零七角半云、</p>
<h3>麵粉近遠同俏</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份初仍平定、因洋麥報價小一二角左右、兼之國事愈不見佳、故人心甚寂、價與前週末相仿、惟本月份因傳福新之標準、除本月份外、以後抽貨、須照現粉加價、致客帮心思、大爲活動、遠期因此帶振、迨至下午開盤本月份仍因客帮之抽購氣勢甚佳遠期因廠抛不暢、外行買戶亦趁勢吸進、均見步俏、惟本月份適在舊歷年關、是否再生變動、尙難逆料也、結果本月份較前週漲一分七厘半、二三月份漲一分半、四五月份漲七厘半、六月份漲五厘云</p>
<h3>六月麥抛盛獨落</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份初見平疲、洋麥報價小去一二角、廠方亦多旁觀、本月份市面、曾一度小至三兩二錢九分遠期亦較小一二分不等、迨至下午開盤、本月份仍然盤處遠期因粉市轉昻人心稍振、較上午似好一二分、惟六月份因抛戶驟暢、突呈暴落、新麥如斯情形、實可注意也、結果本月份不動、二月份較好一分、三月份好二分、四五月份不動、六月份跌七分云、</p>

<h3>閘北貨　厦橘餅地價轉升</h3>
<p>厦門橘餅首批到貨曾兌十九兩、昨聞太古公司之濟南輸入口、又有運到據貨客函、息地價轉升近元、而此批貨色澤亦較紅潤、故市勢有轉緊之象、大約今日可以見樣、若貨品不惡、定有善價云、</p>
<h3>絲茶　海外絲電不轉</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊絲市、仍無轉機緣歲外市塲中日絲銷依然疲靜、絲電不轉、美莊仍思抑價補充廠經缺貨、而廠方虧本太巨、仍無承抛、昨祇信孚等進乾大經二十包、克昌進黄粗絲五包、價仍平疲云、</p>
<h3>高莊珍眉交昜旺盛</h3>
<p>昨日婺源屯溪兩路之高莊珍眉緣茶、英莊保昌洋行、大舉搜辦、恰和同孚等行、亦均有進胃、全市成交共運四百餘箱、惟售開市盤、抽芯貨自一百二十七兩至一百三十五兩、普通貨自一百零五兩至一百十兩、較前見跌三四十兩之鉅云、</p>
<h3>疋頭　川帮續辦嗶嘰華逹呢</h3>
<p>近來毛貨呢絨市勢依然清淡、價亦仍在下落中惟街銷零星、需要尙不弱駐滬川帮、前昨兩日仍有購去、成交貨大半什色華逹呢、格子華逹呢、及元鐵籃灰素嗶嘰等、其他毛貨呢絨、絕少問訊、故嗶嘰與維逹呢、爲目下市銷之最佳者、價亦比上月爲廉如寗豐之元常·藍灰華逹呢、上月份售三兩七錢半、昨由川帮成交、祇爲三兩五錢云、</p>
<h3>五金本廠釘行情趨軟</h3>
<p>本廠元釘、邇因出路甚鉅、所以新廠開出甚多、而行情一節、以此不能統一、最高倍司爲六兩二錢半、最低爲五兩八錢半、自連日市塲開出有二三千桶之多、綜觀後市恐行情一途、尙要再小云、</p>
<h3>新鉛絲貨少價挺</h3>
<p>新鉛絲交易、近來雖不見發展但底貨極少、人心良佳、故行情有節節　提升之勢、刻市每担估十二兩五錢（十六號至二十號）、至二十一號至二十五號、每担則開十八兩五錢、聞内河漢口諸帮購去年貨、有八九百担之多、以致市存更薄、行情有繼續高漲之勢、</p>
<h3>煤炭白煤走銷頗活</h3>
<p>近日外埠客帮之來滬採辦過年煤貨者、已有數起、故日來市塲上異常熱閙、各貨均有走動、尤以各種白煤塊·白煤屑走勢爲最佳、價亦稍俏、計昨市做開柳江白煤塊四百七十噸、價十六兩七錢半、又屑八十四噸價七兩、山西塊三百六十噸、價二十兩零七錢半、紅崎塊四百三十七噸、價二十二兩、又屑二百五十噸、價十一兩二錢半、長城塊一百十六噸價十七兩、膠州塊八十噸、價十四兩、復州屑一百四十五噸價十兩、</p>

<h3>公共租界研究預算不敷之彌補</h3>
<p>▲將以增加巡捕捐抵補</p>
<p>公共租界工部局以明年預算、雖於開支方面、痛加减削、仍難期出入相抵、擬即向稅納西人年會、提議增加巡捕捐二厘、由百分之十四增爲十六、估計約可增加歲入一百二十萬兩、此項提議、先經該局財政委員會根據會計處報告、詳細研究後、上次董事會議、業已加以縝密討論、當以關係重大、未即决定、現將留待華董提出詳細意見後、再予考慮、</p>
<p>據昨日工部情報處發表、略謂工部局董事會、刻正縝密研究財政地位、當去年九月間、會計處即預料本會計年度終了時、或將虧短六十萬兩、嗣將各處開支　加　節、而匯市亦見起色、日前財政委員會開會時、會計處長提出九個月收支册報、擊稱預料本年度虧短、已可减至二十萬兩以下、惟一九三二年度預算、不僅須彌補此項虧短、且較本年度尙須多籌二百三十萬兩、因一九三○年度有二百三十萬兩乃餘　人本年、而一九三二年度則無上年滾存、可資挹注、又一九三一年度、有積存米用之欵五十萬兩可以撥用、惟預計一九三二年度經常收入、亦可增加四十萬兩、現一九三二年度各處經費預算、甫經編竣、將來可以减刑至若何程度、此間尚難逆料、就目前所開、公共工程處經費與一九三一年度相若、但已將略帶投資性質之二十萬兩、移入特别開支項下、衞生處經費、比一九三一年度約增十五萬兩、關於敎育方面、刻正有敎育事業、應列在减政範圍以外之提議、而渠亦贊成、在此初期發展時、不宜加以不正當之限制、渠擬另編一預算、就目下業經通過原則之敎育計劃、倘按期進行、則一九三二年度應支經費若干、而今後數年間、將需經費若干、一一臚列以資通盤規劃、至就日前所垣計、則一九三二年度將以一百五十萬兩用諸敎育、其數額約等於巡捕捐二壓之收入、又關於一九三二年預算收支之均衡問題、會計處長聲稱、即令各處在可能範圍内、儘量减改、若巡捕捐仍照一分四厘微收、終難期歲出入之適合、工部局在上屆稅納西人年會時、即應請納稅人增稅、祇因有前述之一九三○年度滾　等鉅欵、可勉强彌補、故未提增稅之議、工部局金鎊付欵之匯價漲落、向爲均衡預算之重要份子、倘一九三二年度能逹二先令之匯率、則比一九三一年預算、約可節省一百十萬兩、但未來十二個月之匯價、勢　預料、故不得不於某種欵項、預計匯率　、略爲審愼、然即令工部局能設法獲得有利之匯率、而在目前環境之下、不增巡捕捐、終難均衡預算、會計處長又謂、查一九二七年曾以收支不敷、增加巡捕捐爲百分之十六、但目下各處經費、又增於前、如警務處經費指數、比之一九二七年、巳爲百分之一百十三、商團處百分之一百七十三、第因匯價可望見長、而重估地價、稅收亦增、故巡捕捐增爲百分之十六後、或可望歲出入之適合、且較諸西國各都市、百分十六之捐率、亦可得極低、又謂自去年九月財政委員會開會後、工部局即下令各處主任、在本年度餘數月間、尤其在編造一九三二年預算時、務必盡力减刑開支、現各處主任、均能就職權内能力所及、儘量减改、退深覺滿意云云、當時財政委員會將會計處　議　加討論後、即　定贊成增稅之議、但於趨定一九三二年度量後預算時、仍須將財政情形重加考慮一次、迨此案移至董事會議討論會計處長聲稱、即於增稅二厘後、增加收入一百二十萬兩、預計一九三二年預算、仍將虧短、須將各處開支加以减刑、並將經常特别兩預算間若干欵目、重加整理、始能　補、旋有某董事議、應將納稅人負扣能力、併加考慮、於是各董乃轉而討論各業財政情形、會計處長聲稱、苟欲維持各根本要政、必不能减刑預算所虧至二百萬兩之鉅、嗣有某董表示、以滬市之繁盛、徴巡捕捐百分之十六、尙非不宜、故渠主張預算即增照百分之十六捐率編製、同時並向市民詳細說明、不得不增稅原委、最後乃决定將此案、延至下次會議决定、此時先請華董再提出詳細意見云、</p>

<h3>日紗冒華商標</h3>
<p>▲改頭換面之狡計</p>
<p>▲榮宗敬派人破獲</p>
<p>自瀋陽事變、日本侵略東省陰謀暴露以來、國人激於義憤、對日經濟絕交運動、莫不攘臂奮呼、舉國一致、故日本在華貿昜、頗受重大打擊、而尤以紗業爲最甚、不料邇來滬上竟有無恥奸商、私自購進日紗、改頭換面、冒用中國有名紗廠商標、魚目混珠、以圖厚利、昨日午夜申新紗廠職員得眼線報告、在滬東查獲冒充該廠人鐘商標之日紗十五大包、茲將經過情形、探誌於后、</p>
<p>▲榮氏紗業　無鍚巨商榮宗敬君、爲我國麵粉界之巨擘、更執紗花業之牛耳、滬上最著名之申新紗廠、即榮君所手創、查申新先後成立共有九廠、除第三廠設於無鍚、第四廠分設漢口外、其餘第一·二·五·六·七·八·九·等七廠、均設本埠滬東一帶規模宏大、他廠罕與其匹、出品優良、信用早著、</p>
<p>查獲冒牌綿紗攝影</p>
<p>▲奸商冒牌　自九一八案暴發、對日經濟絕交後、日紗遂一落千丈、榮君更乘此良機、晝夜加工出貨、以應急需、不料兩星期前、榮君忽據報告、謂現有不肖奸商、私將日紗潛昜華紗商標、改頭換面、冒充申新二十支黄人鐘及四十二支藍人鐘等牌號、在市混售、請速嚴密偵查、以儆奸頑云云、</p>
<p>▲派人追踪　　榮君聞報、特加注意、當即密飭第五廠庶務主任胡慶昇、總稽查齊海田·等專事負責偵查、胡齊亟派出幹員多人、各處探訪、卒鮮效果、直至九日早晨、始有人密報前來、謂頃見昆明路附近發見日商海陸運輸公司運貨卞車、車上遺有紗跡、形跡甚爲可欵云云、胡齊二人、聞訊立即同乘汽車趕往、比至昆明路中叚、果瞥見該處停有海陸運輸公司一四二八及一六五一三號卞車、曁上海搬塲公司汽車（號碼租界九七二○號）各一輛、車上滿載日紗、並有小工多名、將紗搬運至一八四號新式平房内、</p>
<p>▲枯守得間　胡齊一見情形頗滋疑慮、且一八四號平房旣非貨棧、又非織廠、定有秘密行動無疑、胡齊遂密議分别進行、胡亟回廠報告、齊即留在昆明路、暗加監視、詎料兩人枯守兩日兩夜、直至昨日晨七時○五分、果見原有汽車兩輛、滿載棉紗而出、齊胡不動聲色、亦乘車在後尾追、直緊隨至閘北天同路狄思威路口、該處已入華界、爲公安局五區三分所轄境、</p>
<p>▲鳴警破案　當時殿後之卡車上、有人注意胡齊所乘之車、正欲設計逃竄時、胡齊巳先後下車、鳴警將兩車阻止、細察紗質、明係日紗二十支、豐年牌改換申新黄人鐘及日紗四十二支藍鳳牌、冒充申新四十二支藍人鐘、遂一併帶入五區三分所、隨經張所長細訊一過、據卡車之汽車夫供名王桂勲、寗波人、該項日紗係由日商豐田紗廠裝出、載至昆明路一八四號、改換牌號、今日係受日人森君之命、將上項僞紗、裝至狄思威路日人消毒所打包、然後運往外埠混售、至於上海本埠、祇有法租界福履理路華昌染織廠代銷此貨等語、</p>
<p>▲日人喪退　張所長正在預審之際、忽有日人山路、木村、三田、等率領大批日本浪人蜂擁到所、高聲呼嘯、形勢洶洶、張所長見勢不佳、恐釀意外、遂一面用詞向日人敷衍、一面急電總局請示、温局長聞訊、立派第二科外事股洪主任趕往交涉、洪抵五區之時、日浪人尙叢集該所大門、旋經洪主任嚴詞駁詰、日人理屈詞窮、毫無狡辯餘地、遂相率懊喪散去、洪主任亦亟回報局長、</p>
<p>▲移送法院　温局長據洪主任報告後、以雙方俱住公共租界、理應移解法院法辦乃命張所長先將兩車所載總數、檢點清澈、總計六十四大草包、一面由所知照哈爾濱捕房、將原物司機人等、一併解送特區第一法院楊院長着周庭長辦理、周庭長以本案有偵查必要、立將雙方送交楊樹浦捕房偵查、開車人王桂勲暫押候訊、申新職員胡齊兩人、命暫行回廠、靜候審理、</p>

<h3>上海是罪惡淵藪幸·</h3>
<p>八日本報本埠新聞欄中載有一則新聞，這新聞當是採訪自租界當局，統計去年一歲中，就公共租界一隅言：共發生謀殺重案三十三起，綁票案之報告捕房者，不下二十五起，盜竊小案，更難計數。總計全年刦奪偷竊之財物，竟值二百二十二萬五千之鉅。捕房所拘中外罪犯，全年逾一萬七千人，偵察罪案共逹一萬八千起。若以全埠併計，則更不止此數。這便是［上海是罪惡淵藪］的說明。　　誠然，上海是罪惡的淵藪，不僅上海，一切的都市都是魔窟，都是罪惡的製造廠。然而假如我們只舉上述的謀殺案，綁票案，盜竊小案，價值二百二十二萬五千的贜物，公共租界捕房所拘的一萬七千個中外罪犯，被偵察的一萬八千起罪案，以及合全埠併計，不止此數的數目等說明上海是罪惡的淵藪，很顯然的，這說明是［不公平］。</p>
<p>上述的這此罪案，如盜竊，如綁票，如殺人，當然，大都是下層社會的朋友幹的，但這裏我們要進一步的追問，一般的官吏又怎樣？［只准官家放火，不</p>
<p>准民家點燈］，這兩句俗話，已將政治的黑幕無情地戳破，那居尊養貴的，那巍巍乎儼然民上的，那一個不是日日在敲骨呼隨的榨取老百姓的血汗？那一個不是日日在直接地或間接地幹謀財害命的勾當，不過是手段巧妙一點罷了，不過是殺人不見血罷了，假如有人能將這一筆刦奪偷竊的贜物加以統計，這數目總得有［二百二十二萬五千的］幾百倍幾千倍多，魔鬼晝行，幽靈夜出，誰能說魔鬼是善於幽靈呢？不過是人們對於白晝横行的魔鬼，已經看慣，習慣的認爲［合法］罷了，上海的罪惡，便只是這些手段不高明的笨伯，在捕房裏吃官司的下層社會羣衆幹出來的嗎？</p>
<p>進一步說··竊盜刦奪爲什麽發生？自然是由於［飢寒交迫］，爲什麽會飢寒交迫？［朱門酒肉臭，路有凍死骨］，［富</p>
<p>人一席酒，窮人半年糧］，貪官奪去了窮人的衣食，却還說，你爲什麽曾飢寒呀！飢寒之極，窮人便不得不偷一點，搶一點，是欲藉以延長一旦一夕之殘喘，而他們却疾聲高呌··你不安分的暴徒呀，你罪大惡極的匪盜呀！我要問··</p>
<p>［人，有什麽權力能夠說··我是對的，你是不對］。</p>
<p>上海是罪惡之淵藪，豈獨上海？在目前，隨時隨地都在計劃着或實行着謀財害命的勾當·罪犯，舉目皆是贜物，舉目皆是，上海不過是罪惡世界的一角罷了。</p>

<h3>養生質之發明</h3>
<p>坊肆廣告，無論東西，無不喜以維太命Ｖｉｔａｍｉｎ相號召·維太命之譯義，爲養生質·其經實騐，足資應用者，現分甲乙丙丁四種！</p>
<p>食物中之養生質，彼此多寡不同·如牛乳富甲種養生質，雞蛋兼富甲丁兩種養生質，米穀之糠皮，含有乙種養生質·西餐中之菠菜，則兼備甲乙丙之三種養生質，鮮果以及洋薯·羊蘿蔔·獨富丙種養生質·番茄則富乙丙兩種養生質，其經外紫光線照過之牛乳，麪粉，俱富丁種養生質，此外新製西藥，亦有包含某種養生質者，然藉生物化學之試騐，經人工之發明，進而提取純粹結晶之養生質·或設一法以事大量製造，則固未之前聞，</p>

<p>至於缺乏甲種養生質而致身體不發育，缺乏丁種養生質而致發生軟骨病，尙祇限於兒童之一部分，非如缺乏丙種養生質者危害之鉅·其缺乏乙種養生質者，易罹脚氣病，則惟印度熱帶可遇之·且食米苟不多去糠皮，此質仍昜保留·仍遠不如缺乏鮮果素菜而致不得丙種養生質者之無辦法也·</p>

<h3>生活方法種種·杏·子</h3>
<p>在這裏，我不是爲有錢的人寫起居注，而是想描出一幅［生的凌遲］的畫圖㈠從大世界前面的一所平民醫院裏出來，剛走到馬路上，背後忽然有人作一聲怪呌·回頭一望，便有一個亂髮蓬蓬的頭，帶着一幅枯黄得像臘一樣的臉，用苦笑乞憐的眼光，迎上前來，向我打招呼。</p>
<p>［先生我本來是日本××學校的學生，東北事件發生，我便回國，不幸一到上海便生病，現在身邊一錢莫名，想回家又没有盤費·看先生也是讀書人，斯文一脈，當能憐我，不拘多少，請先生帮助我一點盤費罷。］</p>
<p>我摸摸身邊，僅剩有一隻角，而又要到很遠的地方去，便簡截的答覆他··［對不起，我身邊没有多錢］·</p>
<p>可是他並不因我的答覆而失望，還是一步一趨的追隨着我·</p>
<p>［先生，不拘多少，我遇着先生·總算三生有幸，只這一次，决不會有第二次，而且，也許我也有掦眉吐氣之一日，誰能就一個人的現在斷定他的將來呢？］</p>
<p>他的話很足以打動人的心，並不像一個專門［巡閲馬路］的朋友的談吐。我走到新世界，他還是跟在我底背後，我暗暗地想··［這傢伙要錢的决心和毅力倒不差。］</p>
<p>兌散僅有的一隻雙角，留下必需的電車費，其餘便都給了他，殷懃地送了我一條馬路，我眼望着他那蓬亂的頭漸漸爲人海所呑没，心裏很感覺得不安。過後半個月，在另一條馬路上，我的背後又發出一聲怪呌·回頭看，依然又是那個蓬亂的頭，那個黄臘的臉，可是當他看清楚了我之後，乞憐的眼光裏便頓時泛出失望的憂愁，隨手掏了幾個銅板給他，我笑說··［朋友三生石上註定了咱們有兩次見面之緣·］</p>

<p>第一回遭受失敗，有一個記者在報紙對他痛烈的非難，而齊伯林讀着這署名［埃克納］的一叚記事，確是非常恐怖。</p>
<p>第二回又遭失敗了，齊伯林很喪氣的恐怖的再拿起那新聞來讀，然而這一回却使他十分驚喜·，</p>
<p>［齊伯林大飛艇又是一次大失敗，但是他的失敗却展開了前途偉大的希望。我希望齊伯林伯爵能把握住不屈不撓的精神，能夠捲土重來。］</p>
<p>這充滿着好意和同情的文句，重新振作了他悲哀的心情。從此齊伯林便和這埃克納博士結緣了。昨天的敵人今日成爲同志，因此埃克納就繼承齊伯林的大志，而完成了周遊全世界的大航空事業了。</p>
<p>上海故事</p>
<h3>上海故事（六）周容</h3>
<p>×第一任駐滬英國領事道光二十三年（即公曆一八四三年十一月八日）英國駐滬領事官巴爾福大佐（即加皮</p>
<p>台拔爾匪亞ＣａｐｔａｉｎＧｅｏｒｇｅＢ</p>
<p>ａｌｆｏｕｒ）從廣州抵滬，彼曾爲印度砲隊官佐，樣樸鼎查保薦改任駐滬領事，翌日即拜該蘇松太道龔慕九，龔慕九亦赴麥多沙號汽船回拜·</p>
<p>英領抵滬的第一個要解决的問題，即是租借領事館的問題，在西門與東門之間租了一棟大屋，一共有五十二間房子，每年付房租四百元。</p>
<p>在南京條約訂立時，樸鼎查並未提及設立外人居留地的問題，這時候，巴爾福領事與蘇松太道才討論到這個問題。最初蘇松太道並不承認外人在上海有購買土地權，不過可以繼續永久租借土地，租借者須按年付租金。</p>
<p>當時上海的地價，每畝值銅錢十五千至三十五千，每千銅錢約合銀洋一元，後因外人購買地皮，遂漲至每畝值銅錢五十千至六十千。而地皮租價，不過每畝每年付租一千五百銅錢，約合官銀一兩。</p>
<p>×租界最初的範圍</p>
<p>最初設立租界原無一定的範圍：大抵東至黄浦江，南至洋涇浜，北至北京路，西界尙未確定。後來西界擴充至河南路，所包括的範圍，最初不過一百五十英畝而已（每英畝合中國畝六畝五分八厘强）。租界以内地勢很高，原來是一片耕地，其中溝渠縱横，且有墳墓，</p>
<p>當本地業主售地與外人的時候，求要外人保護墳墓，並得允許每年按時掃墓。　　租界設立數年之後，現在的四川路以西一帶仍屬鄉下。外灘一帶，從前原來是河岸上的一條船夫拉締所行的小路，潮漲的時候，有時被潮水所淹。</p>
<p>租界的範圍雖然劃定了，可是還有一件很大的困難不容外人挿足，即是許多業主不願出售他們的地皮，即算願意，索價極昻，就是在出售之後，時常藉故遷延不肯遷出原宅。因此，爲了遷居的緣居，當地的住戶和業主，受了外人不少的壓迫。（未完）</p>

<p>(Beiping) After the Daling River front line was breached by the Japanese army on the 2nd, the volunteer army and our cavalry regiment 41, infantry regiments 654, and part of 658, a total of more than 4,000 people, detoured through Nuanchitang Hongluo Mountain and concentrated on Jinxi, intending to prevent the Japanese army from entering Rehe. The Japanese sent numerous aircraft to bomb our Hongluo Mountain positions, and the Itida and Amano regiments were the main force, taking the road through Dayao Gou. On the evening of the 9th, they directly attacked the rear of our army and surrounded Jinxi. Our army fought desperately all night, killing one Japanese Colonel regiment commander, four lieutenant colonels, fifteen junior officers, and wounding many Japanese soldiers. One of their cavalry units was trapped in a chaotic mountain at night and was attacked by our volunteer army from all sides, resulting in heavy casualties. On the morning of the 10th, the Jinzhou Divisional Headquarters sent the main force of the division from Nü'er River to Dayao Gou for reinforcement, and more than ten aircraft went to Hongluo Mountain and Bijia Mountain yesterday afternoon to bomb continuously. Our casualties were several times greater than those of the Japanese army, but we still defended the dangerous terrain desperately, and by night we were still unable to respond to the surrounded Japanese army. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Beizhen was occupied by the Japanese army's Itida unit on the 9th. When the Japanese soldiers entered the city, they wantonly raped, burned, and killed innocent people, resulting in many tragic deaths. Zhang Shusheng's cavalry and the volunteer army retreated towards the border between Jinxi and Rehe. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The volunteer army east of Jinzhou has been resisting the Japanese army strongly in recent days. A certain Japanese army brigade commander has been killed. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Because of the United States' warning, Japan is somewhat apprehensive and has changed its invasion of Rehe to a slow advance. Furthermore, because our volunteer army still has 30,000 to 40,000 people scattered in various places, all of whom feel the pain of national and family destruction and are unwilling to retreat into the customs with the Northeast Army, they are determined to fight to the death. Their elusive movements are causing concern for the Japanese army. According to transportation circles, at 1:00 PM on the 10th, 400 to 500 of our volunteer army counterattacked Jinzhou. The Japanese army was caught off guard and suffered many casualties. Before long, the Japanese responded with artillery and machine guns, and our volunteer army retreated. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Shanhaiguan at 5:00 PM on the 10th stated that Zhang Shusheng's 3rd Cavalry Brigade, with three or four regiments, and the troops originally stationed in Liaozhong, Heishan, Tai'an, and Zhangwu, have now successively reached the Chaoyang Temple area south of Nanling on the Jinzhou-Chaoyang line. This area is the border between Liaoning and Rehe, not Chaoyang, and is under the responsibility of Brigade Commander Zhang Shusheng for reorganization. The main force of the Japanese army is still near Beizhen and Zhuanchengzi, and has repeatedly engaged in fierce battles with our volunteer army, but there is no sign of rapid advance. However, their air force sends aircraft to inspect and bomb the cities and towns near Jinzhou every day, so that the peasants in the villages with a little wealth have moved away to avoid the war. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) Today, the Kwantung Army Headquarters is very active, preparing to dispatch a large army to deal with the battles at Dagushan and Jinxi. In recent days, the Japanese army has suffered 21 deaths and 32 serious injuries in these two places. In the battle of Jinxi, one Japanese regimental commander, one cavalry lieutenant colonel, one cavalry captain, and one lieutenant were killed, and fifteen officers and soldiers were killed, and twenty were seriously injured. In the battle of Dagushan, one Japanese lieutenant and one captain-ranked medical officer were killed. Therefore, the Japanese army is preparing a large-scale attack on the local militias and volunteer army in these two places. Honjo has now ordered the 19th Division Commander Amano to deal with the Jinxi Volunteer Army. Yesterday, the Jinzhou air squadron and all troops had set off for the front line. Today, troops are being transferred from Shenyang to support Jinxi and Dagushan. It is reported that the 2,000-strong Jinxi Volunteer Army surrounded the Japanese cavalry starting on Saturday, and the battle of Dagushan also began on Saturday night. (11th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) News from Jinzhou: The 3rd Regiment of the 19th Division of the Japanese Army has moved to the Jinxi, Beipiao, and Beicheng areas to attack the volunteer army. Several other Japanese troops are advancing from Dagushan to the Xinlitun area to attack the volunteer army. A train of Japanese soldiers derailed yesterday at Lijia Wopu, which is located on the Datong Railway. The railway was destroyed by the volunteer army. Now the telephone and telegraph lines on the Datong line are all cut off. According to Japanese sources, the volunteer army fighting the Japanese army in various places is quite strong, with machine guns and sufficient ammunition. Currently, all Japanese aircraft in Shenyang have been ordered to go to the Jinzhou area to assist in the battle. News from Xinmin indicates that there is also a risk of the Japanese army being intercepted and attacked by the volunteer army there, and the Japanese army is on alert. The Japanese claim that since the Japanese army launched the suppression of bandits this time, volunteer armies have risen up to resist Japan in various places, and their momentum has become increasingly fierce. The Japanese army is exhausted from running around. (11th National Telegram) (Tokyo) According to news from Japanese newspapers here, preparations are underway for a large-scale bandit suppression operation by the South Manchurian Japanese Army. Currently, twelve troop trains are fired up and waiting to depart in Shenyang. Most foreign observers believe that clearing the banditry will take more than a year and cannot be achieved with the current troop strength, but the Japanese military authorities seem confident that they can complete the entire bandit suppression operation within three months without the need for reinforcements.

<p>Under Japanese instigation, Xi Qia urgently attacked Bin County.</p>
<p>Japanese cavalry artillery moved to Jilin.</p>
<p>Two aircraft dropped bombs in Bin County.</p>
<p>(Harbin) It has been determined that the troops under the command of the Jilin Provincial Government include Zhao Zhixiang's Brigade, Ding Chao's Brigade, Xing Zhanqing's Brigade, Su Dechen's Brigade, Chang Yaochen's Brigade, Li Du's Brigade, and Feng Zhanhai's Regiment. Those under the command of Xi Qia include two security brigades, Li Guilin's Brigade, Ji Xing's Brigade, and one railway guard regiment. Xi Qia's attack on Bin County was due to his fear of the recent successful provincial representative conference held in Binzhou, and because the Japanese side planned to eliminate the forces of the Jilin Provincial Government within a month, Xi Qia launched the attack. Two regiments of Japanese cavalry artillery returned to Jilin on the 9th from Liaoxi. One Japanese aircraft flew over Yushu County on the morning of the 9th for reconnaissance for one week.

<h3>東北義勇軍發表絕命宣言</h3>
<p>Northeast Volunteer Army Issues a Declaration of Determination</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Shanhaiguan at 10:00 PM on the 10th stated that the 6th, 7th, and 8th Brigades of the Volunteer Army in the Jinxi area, in the name of the Northeast People's Self-Defense Volunteer Army, and the lower-ranking officers of the Northeast Army's front line, jointly issued a declaration of determination on the 10th.</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>More than 120 people, including Xiong Fei and Li Decai, signed the declaration. The original document was sent to Yuguan by special messenger from Hongluo Mountain. It briefly stated that after the breakthrough of the Daling River front line, the people of western Liaoning suffered daily from the bombing of Japanese aircraft and the trampling of iron hooves. Even the ten days of Yangzhou and the three massacres of Jiading could not describe its cruelty. Our three major brigades, the 6th, 7th, and 8th of the Volunteer Army, have retreated with our Northeast infantry and cavalry units to the northern back of Hongluo Mountain. They are in a desperate situation with exhausted strength and depleted ammunition and food, but the Japanese army is still advancing inch by inch, step by step. Their intention is not to target the thousands of defeated troops, but to drive straight into Rehe, which is already very clear. Recently, after the recovery of Xinmin and Tieling, the Japanese army has deepened its determination to annihilate our Volunteer Army. Therefore, from 6:00 PM on the 9th to 6:00 PM today, our army has entered a period of hand-to-hand combat with the Japanese army in the chaotic mountains around Jinxi. The intensity of their artillery fire and the number of our casualties are several times greater than those in the battles of Dagushan and Laogou line, and the number of enemies killed is also unprecedented. Knowing that the Japanese army's reinforcements have now surrounded us, the Volunteer Army and our defeated troops will never abandon Jinzhou, as long as there is a glimmer of hope. We hope that the central government will quickly decide on a plan for peace or war, and that the leaders of the Guangdong faction will end their power struggles. If our 4,000 Northeast children, even if they all die in one or two days, will smile under the nine springs and have no regrets. (11th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>How Will the Three Leaders Act and How Will the Key Figures Remain Silent?</h3>
<p>In recent days, the national crisis has become increasingly urgent. After the Japanese army occupied Jinzhou, they continue to advance step by step. The provinces are trending towards division. The three leaders of the central government, Chiang, Wang, and Hu, are still shirking responsibility and unwilling to go to the capital. Other key figures are either traveling to persuade the three leaders to come, or claiming illness and resigning due to lack of solutions. During this extremely difficult and critical period, the central government is almost without anyone willing to take responsibility. Alas, what a heartbreaking scene this is!</p>
<p>With the nation in such dire straits, those who bear the responsibility of leading the central government should not be allowed to slacken in the slightest. Delaying for one more day means one more day of mistakes in national affairs. Shifting responsibility and making concessions for one more day means one more day of increasing national danger. Therefore, if the three leaders still have the determination to put aside past differences and jointly face the national crisis today, they should act swiftly and go to the capital without delay. They should not make excuses or act out of pique. If they are determined not to participate in politics anymore and no longer care about the nation's safety and survival, then they should make it clear to the people of the whole country so that the people no longer harbor extravagant hopes for the unity and concerted efforts of these key figures of the party and state to save the country, and seek other ways to unite and save the country. Other key figures should also assess themselves early on. If the three leaders continue not to go to the capital, can they bear the heavy responsibility? If they cannot, they should also let the people know and seek other ways to remedy the situation. They must not procrastinate any longer, delaying and concealing the situation for a long time. The most urgent issue today is that we dare not be tough on Japan, nor can we retreat immediately. If the central government intends to continue using diplomacy, someone must be responsible for the diplomatic means and policies. The United States has already issued a strong warning independently, and other countries have not yet reached a consensus. The League of Nations is still silently observing the situation and considering it carefully. This is the time for us to use diplomacy. Although the so-called paper tiger of the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact may not be enough to scare Japan, if the United States can act seriously and insist on its determination not to change its previous attitude, it may be possible to slightly reduce the arrogance of the Japanese. However, whether the United States can muster its courage and no longer be deceived by the Japanese also depends on our country's liaison and support. If the central government wants to rely on diplomacy, the timing cannot be delayed. But we hear of no activity whatsoever. What is the reason? The next most urgent issue is how to reverse the phenomenon of division in the provinces, how to remedy the financial crisis, and how to effectively carry out the suppression of bandits and disaster relief. These matters cannot be delayed and must be the responsibility of the central government. If we allow the key figures of the central government to continue to make concessions, the situation will become completely chaotic and the overall situation will become increasingly unmanageable. Can the three leaders shirk this responsibility by saying that it is not their concern? Can the other key figures shirk this responsibility because the three leaders are not responsible?</p>
<p>The three leaders and the key figures hold important positions in the party and state in the capital. Even if they leave the capital, they are still citizens and should bear the responsibility of saving the country today. The failure of national affairs to this point is attributed by commentators to the mistakes of the key figures of the party and state. Even if they are not trying to make amends today, they should at least fulfill their responsibility to the party and state out of conscience. Now, those who have left the capital act as if they can ignore everything as long as they do not return to the capital, and those in the capital act as if they can shirk responsibility because those who have left the capital do not return. But they do not know that this kind of shirking harms the overall situation of the country. Therefore, the people of the country today do not dare to ask for anything else, but only ask the key figures of the party and state to quickly indicate whether they can take responsibility or not. If they can take responsibility, they should quickly indicate how they will take responsibility. It is not what the people of the whole country want if they hold the title of responsible but do not have the substance of responsibility.</p>

<h3>Zhang Xueliang Receives Reporters from Beiping and Tianjin</h3>
<p>Reports on the Current Situation and Financial Status</p>
<p>Unwilling to Express Opinions on Foreign Affairs</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Xueliang received reporters from Beiping and Tianjin at 5:00 PM today and talked about: 1. The current situation. There are many rumors recently. I can responsibly say that it is not as bad as the rumors suggest and does not affect the overall situation. When the Japanese army took Jinzhou, the Northeast generals sent two telegrams expressing dissatisfaction with the central government. I do not agree with this. This should be blamed on our northern soldiers. There will never be a civil war. Even if we are confused to the extent of 160,000 points, we will not dare to do something wrong. I think that the country has suffered a major stimulus and should be unified. If it is not unified at this time, when will it be unified? 2. Foreign affairs. I have always obeyed the central government. I hope that the diplomatic incidents will not escalate and will be resolved as soon as possible. 3. Financial problems. The military pay for the various armies has been planned by the Northeast Political, Military, and Financial Committees. The military and political expenses in North China are insufficient by 2.5 million to 3 million per month. The various armies are paid 80% of their salaries in advance, and now they are discounted to 80%. Because the situation of each army is different, either the number of people is reduced or the money is reduced. The armies under the Northeast system all reduce the number of people without reducing the money. Each company used to have 210 people, but now it has been reduced to 90 people. Even so, it is still insufficient by 500,000 to 1 million. The central government's agreement on funds is related to the security of North China. I hope it can arrive on time. 4. My own problems. When Chiang resigned, I planned to resign at the same time. Some people said that my situation is different from Chiang's. For example, if the kitchen is on fire, we should first try to put it out. After a stage, we will talk about the second stage. As for the second stage, it is another question. 5. Wu Peifu has decided to come to Beiping. I have sent someone to welcome him. This is to respect the elders. I hope he will not interfere in practical matters. I have the same attitude towards other parties. At this time, the government should contact and unite with all parties. Then, in response to reporters' questions, he said that Wang Shuhan had declined the Central Committee's appointment, and I advised him to take office. The central government also repeatedly sent telegrams to urge him, but he is temporarily unable to go to Beijing due to illness. Mo Dehui sent a telegram saying that he had no official business to return to the country. I do not want to express my opinions on foreign affairs. (Special telegram on the 11th)</p>

<p>Important Foreign Telegrams</p>
<h3>After Briining's Declaration</h3>
<h3>British and French Attitudes Differ</h3>
<p>Lausanne Conference</p>
<p>MacDonald Believes a Summit is Even More Necessary</p>
<p>Cancellation of Reparations</p>
<p>French Claim They Do Not Support Declaring the Treaty Invalid</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 10th: The declaration by German Chancellor Briining that Germany cannot continue to pay political reparations has provoked a response from British Prime Minister MacDonald. The British Prime Minister issued a statement tonight, saying that he believes that the governments of the countries concerned all know that the recovery of Europe depends on facing the difficult facts. The British government's policy and opinions can only be announced at the appropriate place and time. But it can be said that, given the internal political difficulties in Germany and the situation disclosed in the report of international experts, we expected that Germany would make a declaration like the one made by Briining today at the Lausanne reparations conference. Now this declaration has been issued before the meeting. The reparations conference is even more necessary, because the current situation is produced by international coordination and should be dealt with by an international conference and cannot be ignored. The British Prime Minister's view is clearly different from that held by political circles in Paris. The French believe that Germany's decision to pay reparations has made the Lausanne conference a useless endeavor. The German Chancellor's declaration is tantamount to announcing that Germany wants to cancel the Young Plan and the Treaty of Versailles.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 11th: Today, general opinion in London regards the German Chancellor's important declaration as a major operation to dissect the Treaty of Versailles through diplomatic means. If Germany does not pay reparations, then both France and Britain will not be able to pay. Financial disputes in the United States will inevitably occur. Some say that if this is the case, it may be a blessing in disguise, because those in power will have the opportunity to erase all war debts and reparations and permanently eliminate the suffering of the world. The United States Congress recently passed a bill opposing the reduction of European war debts, but many Americans do agree with the view expressed by a major American banker that if European debts are cancelled, trade will flourish and the United States will quickly encounter what it has lost. However, cancellation is not a beautiful name. Today, most British and French newspapers do not like the material and formal opinions of the Prime Minister's declaration. The British Financial Times said that if the entire structure of reparations must be destroyed, it is not because Germany has a morally good reason to be liberated, but because any move to demand reparations will harm its creditors. If Germany stops paying reparations, Italy will lose nothing and gain nothing, so the Italian government has not expressed its views on Briining's declaration. France will lose £21 million a year and Britain will lose £11 million. Britain and France have very different views on this point. The number of short-term loans that the French borrow from Germany is very small, so they say that reparations should exceed commercial debts, while the British say that commercial debts should be on an equal footing with reparations. In short, the short-term commercial debts will expire four months before the end of the Hoover moratorium. If creditors insist that Germany pay, then Germany will be completely unable to pay reparations to France.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Berlin, 11th: Since German Chancellor Briining issued a declaration that he was unable to pay reparations, the world has reacted strongly, and German political circles have become tense. After British Prime Minister MacDonald made a frank declaration last night, recognizing that the current situation cannot be allowed to develop naturally and that Briining's declaration was not entirely unexpected, German political circles were greatly relieved. Now, according to a semi-official French news agency in Paris, the French government has no intention of appealing to the International Court of Justice, as some newspapers have advocated. It is also said that the French cabinet will discuss Briining's declaration tomorrow, but in any case, it will attend the Lausanne conference. Therefore, the hope for an international solution to the reparations issue in German political circles has been revived.</p>
<h3>The International Disarmament Conference to be Convened Soon</h3>

<h3>Mrs. Gandhi Detained</h3>

<h3>Unconfirmed Resignation of the American Ambassador to Japan</h3>
<p>▲ Tokyo dispatch, 11th day: According to sources at the American Embassy in Japan, Ambassador Forbes of the United States to Japan has no intention of resigning and returning home. The rumor that Mr. Forbes intends to resign is completely unfounded. Embassy staff also vehemently denied rumors that Mr. Forbes's views differed from those of the State Department in his home country. However, Mr. Forbes does believe that his mission in Tokyo is not permanent, and he very much hopes to resign and return home in due course. Before coming here, he gave the matter deep consideration, but in order to serve the country, he could not persist in his refusal and resolutely took office. Whether he can resign and return home this year is still unknown, but it must wait until the current serious situation has come to an end before it can happen. Furthermore, Mr. Forbes and the State Department have always had harmonious views, and they hold the same views on the Sino-Japanese issue. Therefore, it is not known where the rumors of differing opinions came from.</p>
<h3>Yamaoka Appointed Governor of Kwantung</h3>

<h3>End of Discussions at the Burma Round Table Conference</h3>
<p>▲ Havas London dispatch, 10th day: The Burma Round Table Conference, which opened ceremoniously on November 27th last year in the Upper House by the British Crown Prince, concluded its discussions yesterday. Prime Minister MacDonald will read a government statement at the final meeting on Tuesday, outlining the progress made and the basis for the future. Burma differs from India in history, geography, race, language, religion, customs, and social systems. Since British occupation, it has been under the jurisdiction of the Indian government. It was not until the Indian Round Table Conference in 1930 that, at the request of the Burmese representatives and based on the findings of Sir Simon's investigation, it was decided to separate India and Burma and convene the Burma Round Table Conference. Since the conference began, various constitutional issues have been discussed at length. Most other matters, especially the joint responsibility of cabinet members and the establishment of upper and lower houses, have been passed almost unanimously and a report has been produced. The United Kingdom still retains some reservations regarding finance, military affairs, and diplomacy. Some Burmese representatives are unwilling to separate from India before the main constitutional framework is clarified. The Burmese people may decide this issue through general elections within this month. Economically, India and Burma can be regarded as completely independent. Burma purchases cotton, coal, and tobacco from India, while India purchases grain, kerosene, and timber from Burma, and is its largest customer. Once the two countries are separated, they may adopt tariff protection policies. However, Indian coal is extremely important for Burma's survival, and Burmese grain is also essential for India. Therefore, in addition to financial agreements, India and Burma should also sign trade treaties, which is inevitable.</p>
<h3>British Labour Party Revitalizes</h3>
<p>Intends to Recruit One Million Members</p>
<p>▲ Reuters London dispatch, 11th day: The Labour Party has begun a large-scale membership recruitment campaign, aiming to add one million members.

<h3>Important News</h3>
<h3>Central Party Headquarters and National Government Memorial Week</h3>
<p>▲ At the Central Party Headquarters on the morning of the 11th, the Central Party Headquarters held the eighth weekly memorial service for the late Premier. Present were Central Committee members Ju Zheng, Chen Mingshu, Hong Luidong, Wang Qi, Zheng Zhanan, Li Zonghuang, Chu Minyi, Li Ciwen, Xiao Zhongzhen, Xiao Jishan, Xie Zuomin, Huang Fusheng, and staff Lai Bao, totaling more than 600 people. Ju Zheng presided over the meeting. After the salutations, Chen Mingshu reported, stating that many unfortunate events and changes in the political situation were caused by careless speech. This can be called a disease of the times. The central government has been established for more than ten days, but it has been silent and ineffective, failing to live up to the expectations of the people and comrades. Everyone can understand the content, environment, and responsibilities of the government by reading the speech of President Sun. Mr. Sun spoke very realistically, and the conclusion is to ask the leaders to unite. Without the leadership of the leaders, we are very empty, very scattered, and without strength to support this critical situation. The efforts of the brothers in the past few days have also been for this matter. I would like to briefly report on the past few days. Mr. Wang's illness is very troublesome. He had more than a dozen injections a week ago, and his diabetes decreased to about 110 degrees. Later, some comrades from Beijing came to Shanghai, and after talking for two or three hours in front of his sickbed, he fainted and his diabetes increased to 140 degrees. Therefore, he needs to be re-diagnosed and rested quietly. Mr. Wang is eager to come to Beijing. Although he is ill, it can be said that his heart has already arrived in Beijing. Regarding Mr. Hu, Shu had sent two or three telegrams and the members from Guangdong had also sent telegrams urging him to come to Beijing. Comrades Liu Ziyin and Wu Tiayun went to Hong Kong, and recently the Central Committee also sent Comrade Yu Youren to persuade him. Regarding Mr. Jiang, Shu also sent four telegrams urging him to return to Beijing. Many comrades have visited him one after another, but no reply has been received. The current diplomatic situation is serious, and it is a matter of national survival, relying entirely on the leadership of the leaders. Comrades Sun Zhesheng, Wu Tiecheng, Kong Yongzhi, and Li Junpei went to Fenghua today to urge Mr. Jiang to come forward. The center of a country is related to safety and danger, and the center should be established as soon as possible so that the party and government can be promoted. It is expected that the three leaders will return soon. Now that a great enemy is at hand, we must fight desperately, and all interests, rights, wrongs, and emotions are unnecessary. The unfortunate conflicts between comrades in the past should be resolved and we should embrace each other and cry. We also hope that all comrades will come to the central government and stand on the front line to save the people from disaster in order to solve the current problems. Looking at the current situation, it seems to have become a retreat from the revolution, gradually reaching the end of the road. If the center of the revolution cannot be united and allowed to sink, it will end silently. We must reverse the retreat and re-arouse it, otherwise there is no way to help. In case the three leaders do not come, or are late in coming, and the center is not established and the government is not stable, we cannot wait to die. No matter what, we must support ourselves and fight forward, fighting for the personality of the party and the country, and fighting for the life of the nation, regardless of success or failure, profit or loss, life or death. If we cannot revive the revolutionary spirit of the fourteenth and fifteenth years of the Republic of China, this retreat will not be reversed. Disaster is imminent, and we cannot wait. Everyone must cheer up and seek our way out. The meeting adjourned after the report.</p>
<p>▲ On the same morning, the National Government held the weekly memorial service for the late Premier. Present were Chairman Lin Sen, and ministers and officials of various departments Chen Mingshu, Zhu Peide, Ru Yuli, Chen Shaokuan, Wei Huai, Lu Chao, and others, as well as staff and guests, totaling more than 200 people. Chairman Lin Sen presided over the meeting, led the salutations, and then gave a speech [Wholeheartedness and Consistency from Beginning to End], the original words are as follows: [Today is Memorial Week, and we will talk about the Premier's teachings. Now, let's take the two sentences from the party song that was just sung, "Wholeheartedness and Consistency from Beginning to End," and read them. This party song was originally a school motto made by the Premier for the Whampoa Military Academy and used as a guideline for training armed comrades. The armed comrades who studied at that time were able to abide by this school motto and remain committed to it, so they later made many contributions to the party and the country when they went on the Northern Expedition. After the Northern Expedition was completed and the country was unified, the reason for this was that the comrades generally worked hard to follow this school motto. Today, I am bringing up these two sentences to talk about so that everyone can deeply understand the meaning of these eight characters. So-called "Wholeheartedness," is to ask everyone to concentrate on what they do, and at the same time, in addition to concentration, they must also have a persistent spirit, so after the sentence "Wholeheartedness," there is the sentence "Consistency from Beginning to End." Only by being able to be consistent from beginning to end can things be done successfully. We often hear a very common saying in society, that is, "Nothing is difficult in the world, but only fear of not being focused." It can be seen that difficult things are not to be feared, but lack of focus is what is to be feared. The Premier saw this, so he taught the comrades that whatever they do for the party and the country, they should do it with concentration and perseverance, and at the same time, they must continue to work hard to be consistent from beginning to end, so that there is hope of completion and hope of victory. According to what our sages said, there is also a saying, "A man without constancy cannot be a witch or a doctor." The ancients meant to regard witch doctors as small things that cannot be done because everything, whether big or small, has its difficulties. If you do not have perseverance and encounter difficulties, you will stop or abandon it, and you will inevitably become halfway, and naturally you will not be able to achieve the hope of success. Today, taking advantage of the opportunity of Memorial Week, I would like to specially bring up these eight characters and talk to you about them, hoping that everyone will often reflect on themselves, put them into practice, and make these two great teachings of the Premier show great achievements under the concerted efforts of all comrades.]</p>
<h3>The Truth About the Withdrawal of Defense from Jinzhou</h3>
<p>The withdrawal of defense from Jinzhou is of great importance. The reporter has personally visited Qinhuangdao, Shanhaiguan, and other places, observed with a cold eye, and explored in many ways. The information obtained is somewhat different from the outside reports and the records in various newspapers. A summary is recorded below:</p>
<p>The reporter arrived in Tianjin on the 29th. Tianjin newspapers mostly reported how fierce the fighting was on the front line, while on the other hand, there were rumors that the main force of the Northeast Army was already withdrawing. On the morning of the 30th, I rushed to the front. On the way through Tanggu, there were Japanese soldiers conducting exercises in the same car. The Japanese army in Tianjin has reached 3,000 people, and they are constantly carrying out exercises, the purpose of which is to prevent the deployment of our army's war equipment. Since the beginning of winter, the sea traffic between Dalian and Tianjin has used Tanggu as its port. The Japanese reinforcements to Tianjin must be transported by train from Tanggu. Therefore, Japanese soldiers travel back and forth between Tianjin and Tanggu in an endless stream. The Japanese army, as usual, only pays half the fare for the train and keeps an account, not paying in cash. It is said that the Japanese army owes the Beining Railway more than one million yuan in freight charges. When the train stopped at Qinhuangdao, I saw a building at the station with about four rooms full of Japanese soldiers. A Japanese soldier stood in front of the door, acting as a guard. Three Japanese soldiers stood inside the door. One held a telephone and constantly spoke, presumably reporting the train traffic situation to his superiors. Four Japanese warships were berthed at Qinhuangdao. One of them then sailed to Shanhaiguan. Shanhaiguan originally had three Japanese gunboats and one aircraft carrier berthed there. On the 31st, another gunboat was added, which came from Qinhuangdao. Shanhaiguan originally had about 100 Japanese garrison troops stationed there due to the Boxer Protocol, but this has recently been increased to more than 200 people. The area where the team is stationed has complete fortifications such as barbed wire and trenches, and it is said that tunnels were dug long ago, but it is not known where they now lead. Shanhaiguan also has Italian and French troops stationed there, but the number is not large.</p>
<p>Shanhaiguan is defended by the Independent 9th Brigade, whose commander is He Zhuguo. He is from Guangxi and graduated from the Japanese Military Academy. The reporter once sent a card to visit him and was received. He is very knowledgeable about the history of Japanese aggression in the Northeast and important issues in the Northeast, such as railway commercial lease rights. When asked about military plans, he sighed loudly, saying that the duty of soldiers is to defend the territory and the country. If the Japanese army invades, he will resist to the death, but if Jinzhou is not defended, Shanhaiguan will be in danger with the enemy, and he will really not be able to do anything. When necessary, he will only have to die to repay the country.</p>
<p>Shanhaiguan is only a few miles from the coast. The Japanese warships' artillery fire can reach the area directly with plenty to spare. There are no mountains along the coast, and there is no way to defend against the navy. Moreover, the Japanese side originally had garrison troops stationed there, and the aircraft carrier is berthed here, using the sea, land, and air forces together. With a small number of troops (He's brigade has a total of 10,000 people, but they are stationed in Lutai, Yuguan, and various places along the Beining Railway), how can he resist? Therefore, Yuguan has long been lost to us. Now there is no great significance in defending or not defending. It is truly difficult for He's brigade.</p>
<p>Shanhaiguan has always been the gateway to the Northeast, and the people of the country all know its importance. However, with the mountains extending outwards, it is very difficult to enter the pass. Now, the Japanese army has occupied the danger to the west from the east. Shanhaiguan has no danger to defend, and not only does Shanhaiguan have no danger to defend, but also all places west of Shanhaiguan are the same. The Beining Railway runs along the coast, and it is protected by towering mountains. Everywhere is under the threat of Japanese warships' artillery fire. How can we survive? Therefore, if Jinzhou is not defended, Tianjin will be in the hands of the Japanese. The construction of the Beining Road never considered national defense plans in those years. In addition, the Boxer Protocol allowed the demolition of the Dagu Forts and allowed foreigners to station troops and transport troops along the line. Alas, can this be called an independent country? The military authorities of our country are only busy with internal wars and neglect national defense, and it has come to this. To the east of Shanhaiguan, the lands of Suizhong, Xingcheng, and Jinzhou are surrounded by mountains, which are not within the reach of the Japanese navy, and it is not difficult to defend them. The reporter once met with officials of the temporary provincial government of Jinzhou. According to them, the trenches in Jinzhou were completed long ago, and the war materials prepared were also quite sufficient. If defended tightly, they can be supported for at least two months. According to the troops stationed in the Jinzhou area, in addition to the 12th, 19th, and 20th Brigades, there are also the gendarmerie cavalry brigade, training team, plainclothes team, etc., totaling no less than 50,000 people. Even if Goubangzi is lost and Dahu Mountain is not guaranteed, if they retreat to Jinzhou, they can fight hand-to-hand for a while. If Jinzhou also falls, Xingcheng and Suizhong have dangers to defend. Moreover, volunteer armies have already risen up in the interior of eastern provinces, which can greatly disturb the rear of the Japanese army. Even if the Japanese army is all-powerful, they will definitely not be able to eliminate our army within two or three months and reach Yuguan and link up with their navy. Moreover, when the Japanese army launched the invasion of Jinzhou, the United Kingdom, the United States, and France had warned Japan. If it lasts for a long time, the international situation will definitely change. How can the Japanese army be sure of winning? Now, everything east of Yuguan is under the occupation of the Japanese army, and there is no danger to defend west of Yuguan. It is like a Japanese defense zone. There are still people in the country who are demanding that the government recover the lost territory by force. I don't know how they will enter the eastern provinces, or how to transport troops and military equipment.</p>
<p>According to various news agencies, it seems that when the Japanese army attacked Jinzhou, our army fought fiercely with them, but eventually withdrew due to lack of strength. But according to what I have heard, those who fought against the Japanese army were volunteer armies composed of students, veterans, and [bandits] of the Republic of China. As for the official army of the Northeast, they did not fire a single shot at the Japanese army, but withdrew automatically. When the Japanese army launched the attack on Jinzhou, reports said that Rong Zhen returned to Ping from Jin, saying nothing, and then went to Xiehe Hospital for medical treatment. At that time, Zhang Xueliang was negotiating with Japan, and the Japanese side agreed to go as far as Da Linghe (a station east of Jinzhou). The Northeast army withdrew to within the customs, and the Jinzhou provincial government allowed it to exist, which is the so-called neutral zone realized in an invisible way. Rong Zhen then returned to Jin and ordered all the troops to withdraw to within the customs. The 12th Brigade, stationed between Changli County, first withdrew on the 29th, followed by the 20th Brigade and the 19th Brigade. All brigades withdrew to within the customs on the 31st. Rong Zhen's special train arrived in Luan County on the afternoon of the 1st. When the withdrawal began, the main force of the Japanese army was still in Xinmin, but they soon tracked them down, bypassed Jinzhou, and headed for Shanhaiguan. The aircraft carrier berthed in the Bohai Sea (near Shanhaiguan) sent out planes to force Shanhaiguan and welcome the advance of the Japanese army. All personnel of the Northeast Frontier Defense Army Headquarters in Jinzhou left Jinzhou on the 31st, and the temporary provincial government also disappeared invisibly. The Northeast authorities have always adhered to a policy of non-resistance. I don't know where their intentions lie. (Published in Tianjin on January 7)</p>
<h3>The Problem of Traffic on the Beining Railway</h3>
<p>Tianjin correspondence: The Beining Railway, since the Japanese army's invasion on September 18th, has been repeatedly devastated by the Japanese army in various sections outside the pass. The railway property has been destroyed, the employees have been injured and killed, and the losses of public and private property are incalculable. However, the internal and external employees still hold the spirit of perseverance, defying all dangers and overcoming all difficulties, and do their best to maintain traffic. The national and provincial institutions outside the pass have been swept away by the Japanese army. The only thing that the people of the Northeast rely on to communicate with the interior is the Beining Railway. Since the incident, the passenger train on the section outside the pass has never been stopped for more than a day, so the news is relatively well-informed, and its contribution to traffic is also very great. However, since the withdrawal of our army from Jinzhou, all employees on the trunk road outside the pass have lost their protection. Feeling the coercion of the Japanese army, they have to temporarily avoid it, so they made an orderly withdrawal, while retaining a small number of important staff stationed in the major stations. However, due to the Japanese military operations, the four passenger trains that left ahead of schedule were unable to return. Later, as our army had all withdrawn into the customs and the Japanese army had advanced to Wanjiatun, the first station outside Shanhaiguan, it gradually became peaceful in recent days. The Railway Bureau is eager to seek to resume traffic, so it sent Hu Chunzan, the former director of the Shenyang Office, and the original employees of each section and station, to go east from Shanhaiguan on January 5th. When they arrived in Xingcheng, they met the commander of the Japanese army stationed there and negotiated the traffic method. The commander said that he was only responsible for military affairs, and the matter of traffic had to be discussed with the current Fengtian Transportation Committee. (According to Shenyang originally set up the Northeast Transportation Committee, which was moved to Beiping after September 18th. The current Transportation Committee is an organization composed of committees appointed under the control of the Japanese. The chairman of the committee is Ding Jianxiu.) Mr. Hu reported this result to the Tianjin General Bureau. At the same time, the General Bureau also received a telegram from Shenyang from the Director of Transport and Jian of the road, an Englishman, saying that there was no problem with the traffic of the entire road, but according to the Japanese consul stationed in Shenyang, it must be discussed with the new government here before it can be implemented. After receiving these two reports, the Railway Bureau believes that since there is a traitorous pseudo-Transportation Committee in the middle, it is feared that the traffic on the entire road will not be easy to achieve in the near future. Since the road has a Sino-British company loan relationship, the representative of the Sino-British company stationed on the road, that is, the current English manager of the road's accounting office, in cooperation with the English chief of the engineering department, went to Ping from Tianjin on January 8 to meet with the British Minister, and to discuss the solution to the traffic problem, or to ask the government to examine it. According to recent reliable sources, the pseudo-Transportation Committee under the control of the current Japanese wants to imitate the previous example and rename the section outside the customs as the Shanfeng Road (that is, from Shanhaiguan to Fengtian) to be managed by the association. The position of director has been assigned to Kan Duo. Kan was the director of the Jiaoji Railway Bureau. If this saying becomes a reality, the problem of traffic on the Beining Road will be more difficult to solve. (January 9)</p>
<h3>Zhang Jinghui Publicly Takes Office as Chairman of Heilongjiang</h3>
<p>▲ Issued a Circular Telegram Stating That He Was Urged by the People of Heilongjiang</p>
<p>▲ All Organizations Imitate the Liaoning and Jilin Methods</p>
<p>▲ The Special Zone Garrison Team Will Be Expanded into a Brigade</p>
<p>Harbin correspondence: There are two things that happened here around the time of the New Year, which, because of strict security, have only now been learned. The records are as follows: ▲The Garrison Team's Mutiny Failed to Materialize The junior officers of the special zone garrison team newly recruited by Zhang Jinghui are mostly graduates of the new special zone police academy. Young and hot-blooded, their love of country is no less than others. However, since the team was established, the Harbin people have scolded it as a traitorous team. Anyone who passes by the team's station must tell each other, which the officers and soldiers heard and felt quite embarrassed. Guan Lu, the third company commander of the first battalion, and Wang Yue, the first company commander of the second battalion, thought of making achievements to get out of the situation. They secretly contacted the platoon leaders, intending to unite the officers and soldiers of the first and second battalions to raise the banner of the National Salvation Army and go to Hailun to join Ma Zhanshan. After a long period of brewing, by the end of last month, all officers and soldiers had been contacted and agreed. They also planned to coerce Lin Yuzhao, the director of education of the police academy, to be the leader in order to appeal. Three days before New Year's Eve, Lin was taken from his private residence. They planned to launch the mutiny late at night on New Year's Eve, first coercing the fourth battalion and the special battalion to act in unison, shelling the Japanese Consulate on Jilin Street in Nangang, and then using infantry to drive and kill the Japanese residents on Daoli and Daowai streets. Then they would break into the Qiulin department store, a large White Russian merchant, and each person would take a woolen blanket. They would then seize all the cars in the city, set off firecrackers, and parade through the streets for a week before heading to Hulan north of the river to gather and then go to see Ma Gushan to surrender. However, the day before the uprising, Lin Yuzhao suddenly claimed that his qualifications were far inferior to those of the chief captain Yu Bianwan, and he was willing to accompany two or three people to persuade Yu to be the leader. The platoon leaders did not notice and accompanied Lin to Yu's residence. Lin immediately told Yu the mutiny plan of the two teams. Yu immediately detained the few people who went, and then went to the first and second battalion stations overnight to convene the police officers for a speech, using the friendship of teachers and students (Yu was the director of education of the police academy). The platoon leaders, seeing that the opportunity had been revealed, agreed to stop the matter. Guan Lu and Wang Yue, who advocated the mutiny, were also replaced, and the matter ended. Now, most of the police officers in each team have been replaced to prevent another incident. According to reports, the entire temporary garrison team has more than 2,300 people. Except for the third battalion, which was sent to Heihe, about 1,800 people are in Harbin. Zhang Jinghui still feels that the troops are weak, and he has recently agreed with the Japanese to add five battalions, each with 500 people, divided into four companies, one company under the jurisdiction of three platoons, and attached special teams such as mortars, flat-fire guns, and machine guns. The plan is being prepared, and the guns have arrived in Heihe from Tao'ang Road due to the Eastern Railway's refusal to transport them. It will be established at the latest next month. It is said that after the newly added troops are formed, they will be organized into a brigade together with the previously recruited troops. It is said that Yu Jingtao, the current chief captain, will be the brigade commander.</p>
<p>▲ Zhang Jinghui's Circular Telegram on Taking Office Zhang Jinghui issued a circular telegram on the night of the 1st. The telegram was sent in code, and few people outside knew about it. The original text is said to be as follows: [Since the September 18th Incident in Heilongjiang, Chairman Ma Zhanshan has moved to Hailun, and no one is in charge of provincial administration. The people are panicked and public security is worrying. The representatives of Heilongjiang have repeatedly urged Jinghui to go to Harbin to preside over and temporarily maintain the status quo. Their words are sincere and urgent, and I cannot refuse. In addition to sending Deputy Police Chief Ying Shun to temporarily maintain public security in the provincial capital, I will formally take office as the Chairman of the Heilongjiang Provincial Government on the 1st of this month. All organizations will imitate the Provincial Governor's Office of Fengtian and the Chief Executive's Office of Jilin. Everything does not seek change, as long as the status quo is maintained. Jinghui, with his mediocre talents, has been entrusted with this important task, especially in this time of national and local turmoil. I am even more afraid of failing to live up to expectations. I hope that my fellow colleagues will give me corrections from time to time.] The telegram did not list titles at the end, only signed Zhang Jinghui. Around 12 o'clock that night, someone was sent to the telegraph office and ordered to send it urgently. Unexpectedly, at 1:00 a.m. on the 2nd, he suddenly ordered someone to take it back, saying that it would not be sent. Then, after 2:00 a.m., he sent the order to send it immediately. In addition to sending it to Xi Qia of Jilin and Jian Shi Yi of Liaoning, it was only sent to the various agencies in Harbin. It was not sent to the interior or to Ma Zhanshan's office. It is said that a few days ago, Japanese Army Commander Honjo Shigeru and Chief of Staff Itagaki came to Harbin to force Zhang to express his attitude. Zhang was forced to issue this telegram. At the same time, Ying Shun, Zhang's representative in Heilongjiang, was ordered to carry out the organization of the provincial government, first restoring the three departments of civil affairs, finance, and propaganda. Zhang may go to Heihe within a few days to hold an inauguration ceremony. (January 4)</p>
<h3>White Russian Disturbances Continue</h3>
<p>▲ Repeated Attacks on Police Stations</p>
<p>▲ Japanese Covertly Instigating</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: Following the White Russian rioters' incident, police in full uniform patrolled Central Avenue from 9 p.m. on the 4th, prohibiting pedestrians from entering each intersection. Around 10 p.m., all Russians except Chinese were barred from passing. At 10:30 p.m., over ten Russian rioters fired a volley at the Daoli Yangcaoshi police station, prompting the station to extinguish its lights and scatter them. At 11 p.m., the rioters moved to the First Precinct, firing at the Shaman Street police station and shattering its door lamp. The station responded with gunfire, and the rioters proceeded to the First Precinct's entrance, intending to shoot inside. The guard on duty noticed this and fired a volley, scattering the rioters. At 11:10 p.m., the Xidaqiao outpost of the Nangang Third Precinct was also besieged by over forty Russian rioters. The outpost returned fire, and after a ten-minute standoff, the rioters were driven back. One rioter was captured on the scene, found to possess a war knife and an Imperial Russian military flag. When questioned about his name, he remained silent. Security was tightened last night, with over a thousand members of the Provisional Garrison's First Battalion deployed. The situation gradually eased today, but it is anticipated that the rioters will launch planned attacks tonight. Officials have confirmed that the Japanese consulate is instigating this, paying each rioter twenty-five yuan in gold notes redeemable upon presentation. The Japanese consulate's scheme aims to: first, have the consular body claim that the Harbin authorities are unable to maintain order, necessitating international co-management and the deployment of Japanese troops to Harbin; second, target Wang Duanhua, the chief of the Special Police, specifically because he is associated with Zhang Xueliang and considered by the Japanese to be connected to the old Northeast regime, creating panic to protest to Zhang Jinghui and remove him from his position. The Russian-language newspaper run by the Japanese has been exaggerating news about police shootings in the past two days, claiming that several innocent White Russians were injured, with the intention of inciting animosity and pushing White Russians toward extremism. On the evening of the 4th, the Governor's Office held a special meeting regarding this matter, attended by Zhang Jinghui, Wang Ruihua, Ding Chao, and Xing Zhanqing, among others. Someone reported the Japanese conspiracy to Zhang, who became very angry and slammed the table, saying, "I have already accommodated the Japanese in everything, hoping that the region would not be ruined, only to earn the reputation of a traitor. What more dissatisfaction do the Japanese have? They must create a chaotic situation. If that's the case, then we must officially take action. Even if I sacrifice my old life, I will not regret it." Ding Chao was also quite angry, saying, "Since the White Russians are so unappreciative, fortunately, we still have two brigades of troops here. We might as well fight them." Subsequently, those who advocated for reconciliation advised Zhang to visit the Japanese consulate to inquire about the Japanese's true intentions and express our determination to maintain order. Zhang immediately went to the Japanese consulate that night, visited Oashi Chūichi, and had a lengthy discussion. The Japanese consul firmly denied instigating the White Russian riots, only promising to suppress the Russian-language newspaper to prevent the situation from escalating due to propaganda. After Zhang returned to his office, he informed the leaders, saying, "Let's wait and see for a day or two." On the night before last (the 3rd), when the Russian rioters attacked Xiaowen Street, they threw a hand grenade at the police. The rioters fled to Xin'anbu that night, where five were intercepted by the Fifth Special Police Precinct. They found a pistol, stolen from a precinct police officer. The names of these five are: Marcheinko Vitte, 19 years old; Nikowei Yevich, 31 years old; Magosiknow, 18 years old; Mage Bowaite, 27 years old. After being sent to the Investigation Bureau, they have not confessed. However, it was discovered that these five Russians had previously been imprisoned several times for theft and had just been released. On the police side, two have died, both garrison soldiers: Liu Jingrui and Sheng Fuduo. (January 5th)</p>
<h3>Continued Report on the Assassination Case in Fuzhou</h3>
<p>▲ The Provincial Government Completely Bans Anti-Japanese Movements</p>
<p>▲ And Provides a Solatium of 50,000 Yuan to the Deceased</p>
<p>▲ But Public Sentiment is Agitated and the Market Remains Tense</p>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: Regarding the assassination of the Japanese elementary school teacher Mito Sanuo and his wife in Fuzhou, although the provincial government has offered a reward of 10,000 yuan to capture the murderers, four days have passed without a breakthrough. According to observations from various sources, it is believed that the murderers were Japanese or Taiwanese, and the case is significantly related to romantic issues, having nothing to do with our side. However, three Japanese warships, including the "Ayashi," entered Mawei around 8 a.m. on the 7th, leading to widespread rumors that Japanese sailors would land and be stationed in the Cangqianshan and Fan Chuanpu areas on the south bank of the Taijiang River. Rumors spread, and public sentiment became agitated. Rice and foreign currency prices suddenly soared. Exchanging paper money for foreign currency required a premium of ten cents per yuan, and the price of white rice also jumped from 11.5 yuan to 12 yuan per shi (unit of measure). Therefore, on the afternoon of the 7th, the provincial government issued a proclamation, stating, in brief, that the government would take responsibility for handling recent diplomatic incidents, but rumors were rampant. During this period of martial law, spreading rumors was inexcusable. In addition to ordering military and police organs to strictly investigate and handle the matter, the proclamation was issued to inform all merchants and residents to live and work in peace, not to heed rumors lightly, and to avoid causing disturbances. This was of utmost importance. After the proclamation was issued, the market atmosphere remained tense because the military and police had not yet lifted martial law.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>Furthermore, on the afternoon of the 7th, Lin Zhiyuan, a member of the provincial government, toured the city and public places with the Japanese consul. The Japanese consul expressed satisfaction upon seeing that anti-Japanese slogans and publications had been completely covered with other advertisements, and that various anti-Japanese groups had also disbanded in compliance with orders. As the Mito Sanuo couple's murder case was unrelated to our side, the provincial authorities would provide a solatium of 50,000 yuan to resolve the matter. The Japanese consul had agreed to halt the landing of sailors, and the warships might leave within a few days. (January 8th)</p>
<h3>Han Fuju Takes Over National Tax Agencies</h3>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Han Fuju previously, due to the central government's arrears in paying the Third Route Army's salaries for several months, resulting in the inability of soldiers and officers to maintain their livelihoods, once ordered the takeover of Shandong's national tax agencies, such as the Salt Transportation Office, the Tobacco and Alcohol Stamp Tax Bureau, the Consolidated Tax Office, the Saltpeter Bureau, and the Lu Da Mining Tax Office, using central tax revenues to pay military expenses. Subsequently, Jiang Bocheng returned to Jinan from Beijing, indicating that the Third Route Army's expenses would still be the responsibility of Finance Minister Song Ziwen, who would be in charge of planning and allocating funds. Thereupon, Han again ordered the reversal of this decision, instructing all agencies to revert to their original status. Now, with Song's departure and the reorganization of the National Government, the Third Route Army's salaries are still not being allocated. Recently, the heads of national tax agencies in Shandong have become increasingly irresponsible. For example, Yuan Timing of the Salt Transportation Office has been in Beijing for over a month, and Xiang Jieren, the head of the Tobacco and Alcohol Stamp Tax Bureau, has also been traveling between Beijing and Jinan, effectively neglecting their duties. If this continues, tax revenues will be greatly affected. Today (the 9th), he specifically ordered Li Wuchen, the chief of the General Headquarters' Military Law Department, to serve as the Salt Transportation Commissioner, and Meng Zhaokong, the director of the Military Supplies Department, to serve as the head of the Tobacco and Alcohol Stamp Tax Bureau, taking over the two agencies again to facilitate reorganization. (Note: Li and Meng are the same individuals previously appointed to take over the Salt Transportation Office and the Tobacco and Alcohol Stamp Tax Bureau.) There is no news yet regarding the takeover of other national tax agencies. (January 9th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Provoke Again in Wuhu</h3>
<p>▲ Assaulting Boatmen, Sailors Landing</p>
<p>▲ Making Unreasonable Demands to the County Government</p>
<p>Wuhu Dispatch: Since news of Jinzhou's fall, the people of Wuhu have been heartbroken and doubly concerned about national salvation efforts. In addition to telegraphing the central government to declare its policy towards Japan, the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association yesterday sent a letter to the Wuhu Iron Blood Corps for National Salvation, urging them to go north immediately to kill the enemy and save the nation. A farewell meeting will be convened within days to boost morale, and a large banner has been specially made to be presented to the corps upon their departure, to embolden them. Chen Tiaoyuan, the chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government, has also telegraphed the National Government, requesting a swift determination of diplomatic strategy and expressing his willingness to lead the troops in Anhui and serve as a vanguard. However, the Japanese residents in Wuhu, seeing the progress of their country's aggression, are extremely arrogant and have been provoking us for days. Fortunately, our people have remained calm and patient and have not engaged with them. Unexpectedly, around 2 p.m. on the 9th, a Japanese man named Lin Zhengji changed into Chinese clothing, purchased a large amount of food, and hired a boat to transport it to the Japanese warship "Hirado" stationed in Wuhu. When the boatman, Sun Youcai, asked why he was impersonating a Chinese, the Japanese, being of a violent nature, suddenly struck Sun's head with an oar. The people on the river were outraged, but seeing that Sun's injuries were not life-threatening, they restrained themselves. Unexpectedly, the cunning Japanese, after boarding the "Hirado," fabricated a story and reported it to the ship's captain, who dispatched a large number of armed sailors to escort him ashore. He also fabricated a report to the Japanese Consul Shirasaki Hakuo. Without investigating the facts, the consul made unreasonable protests to the Wuhu County Government, demanding three points: 1) Strictly punish Sun Youcai; 2) Suppress the anti-Japanese movement; 3) Protect Japanese residents along the river. After receiving the protest, County Magistrate Yu Bohua not only refuted each point but also planned to lodge a serious protest, requesting the Japanese side to punish the culprit and apologize. It is unknown how this will be resolved. (9th)</p>
<h3>Trend Towards Resolution of Fengxian Incident</h3>
<p>Xuzhou Dispatch: Regarding the mutiny of the Third Cavalry Division stationed in Fengxian, Yu Huaizhong from the Jiangsu Provincial Party Headquarters, Han Shouqian from the Provincial Government, and Zhang Ruitang from the Pacification Commissioner's Office have successively arrived in Fengxian to investigate. The commissioners have now clarified the incident. It is said to have originated from the instigation and provocation of the grain department personnel. Most of the personnel in the grain department engaged in personal gain and corruption. Although County Magistrate Yang Liangyi dismissed them, the grain irregularities have not been completely resolved. The dismissed personnel, upon hearing the news that the Party Committee Dong YuJue and others were organizing a committee to investigate the accumulated malpractices of the grain department, feared that the accumulated malpractices would be exposed and the dismissed personnel would be held accountable. At a time when the local authorities were unable to cope with the Third Cavalry Division's supplies, the grain department personnel fabricated rumors that Dong YuJue and others were obstructing the supply, inciting military unrest, and colluding with the police force to take certain actions. The Third Cavalry Division had already been dissatisfied because the local authorities were unwilling to bear the burden of supplies. Consequently, some officers and soldiers were misled by them, and Zhang Zhankui did not investigate, resulting in a sudden disturbance, the capture and detention of Dong YuJue and others, and the removal of public funds and confiscation of firearms. Furthermore, the grain department personnel colluded with the soldiers of the division to burn all the grain records, in an attempt to destroy evidence. Thus, a serious situation was formed. People from all walks of life in Fengxian fled the area, accusing Commander Zhang of mutiny. Zhang, in turn, submitted a report to the Pacification Commissioner's Office, accusing Dong of being reactionary. In reality, Zhang was deceived by the schemes of others, and Dong and others were also unjustly tormented. After the commissioners completed their investigation, the gentry of Fengxian came forward to mediate, agreeing to two things: 1) All organs of Fengxian would send a telegram to restore the reputation of Commander Zhang, and bear the supplies designated by the Provincial Government; 2) Commander Zhang would release the detained personnel and return the confiscated firearms. With the mediation plan established, the commissioners left Fengxian separately to report back. Yesterday (the 9th), Yu Huaizhong, a member of the Provincial Party Headquarters, passed through Xuzhou southward. According to discussions, after the mediation of the gentry, the Fengxian incident may be resolved. (10th)</p>

<p>The Finance Bureau Strictly Urges the Conversion of Land Tax into Rice Tax: The land along the coast of this county is barren. Following the order of the provincial authorities to start collecting converted land tax into rice tax last year, the residents of the 15th district repeatedly requested a delay. The accumulated cases were substantial. After hearing that Jinshan and Fengxian, neighboring counties that had also been ordered to start collection, had been granted a delay, the residents of this district argued even more fiercely and even submitted a resolution for exemption at the fourth county administrative meeting. The county government, based on this, forwarded the request to the Finance Department. The order was received to still investigate and handle the matter according to the original plan and strictly urge the bureau to expedite the collection, without allowing any delays. After the Finance Bureau relayed this, it stated that the income from the conversion of land tax into rice tax had already been included in the budget, and any shortage would affect the designated expenditures. The order from the provincial authorities to expedite the transfer was urgent, so the bureau repeatedly persuaded the landowners to understand the situation and actively contribute, ensuring that the tax for this year and the past two years (years 18 and 19 of the Republic) was quickly paid into the treasury. If there were any further delays, the police would be ordered to arrest and escort them. If any local bullies were found obstructing, they would be severely punished. This notice was to inform all landowners.</p>
<p>The County Court President Transferred: Huang Liang, the president of the County Court, was transferred by order of the High Court to be promoted to judge of the High Court.

<p>Robbery and Arson by Bandits: Chen Qixiu's house in Tiandu Ham, the 15th map of the southern suburbs, was robbed and set on fire. Around 1 a.m. on the 10th, while they were sound asleep, five or six bandits suddenly entered through a window in the small north-facing house. The family members heard the sound of footsteps but dared not investigate. They were robbed of one shi (unit of measure) of unpolished rice and other clothing items before the bandits left through the main gate. Before leaving, they set fire to the north-facing house and the south-facing厢房 (xiāngfáng, side room of a traditional Chinese house) in the courtyard. Straw was also placed at the entrance of the south-facing 厢房 in preparation for spreading the fire. Fortunately, people were immediately called to put out the fire, preventing a disaster.</p>

On suspicion of colluding with bandits, he was detained and sent to the province by the district in conjunction with the police last June. After questioning by the Zhenjiang Provincial Security Office, he denied any involvement. At the same time, the Supervisory Office of the County Public Security Bureau also investigated the officer's daily activities as ordered and provided a guarantee.

A special order was issued to Yang, the head of this county's court, to draft a plan and budget for submission to the Ministry of Justice for review. Recently, President Lin has issued instructions from the ministry to prepare, and the head of this county's court has been instructed to prepare, with the aim of implementing the plan by March of this year at the latest.

<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>The Adjudication of the Mutiny Case of the Traitorous Merchants: The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association Representative Assembly previously decided on five measures regarding the mutiny case of the traitorous merchants. After the County Party Headquarters submitted them to the Provincial Party Headquarters for review, an order was received yesterday (the 10th) approving the case and instructing the county to comply. The measures decided upon are: 1) Because the mutiny case on October 18th was caused by Da Fengren's resistance to the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Movement, a fine of 10,000 silver dollars should be imposed on Da Fengren as a warning. The fine should be allocated to the Chamber of Commerce to cover the advanced payments; 2) From the 10,000 yuan fine imposed on Da Fengren, 9,000 yuan should be allocated as a solatium for the martyr Wu (with 1,000 yuan allocated to subsidize Wu's sister). Before Wu Wenshuang's son comes of age, only the interest can be taken, and the principal cannot be used. The remaining 1,000 yuan should be used for commemorative purposes; 3) Da Fengren is allowed to be unsealed (reopen for business). Whether Hu Ruilin instigated the mutiny case will be resolved through judicial means; 4) A letter should be sent to the County Government to execute Jin Xiangsheng, the main culprit, and to strictly arrest and bring Yu Yiqin and Jianghu Yong Zhu Yuanpei to justice.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>The Finance Bureau Sets a Deadline for Collecting the Busy Tax: The Jiangdu County Finance Bureau yesterday (the 9th) specially summoned the chief tax collectors of the 121 villages to urge the collection of the busy tax, setting a deadline of the end of the old lunar year to collect 150,000 yuan.

Today (the 10th), the chief secretaries have convened a general meeting and are discussing how to allocate the quotas to each village in order to report to the Finance Bureau.</p>
<p>The Chief of the Public Security Bureau Dismissed a Corrupt Patrol Officer: Ge Feng, the chief of the Public Security Bureau, dismissed Yi Da, a patrol officer at the Yongzhen Township Public Security Substation, for allegedly colluding with local bullies.

The chief of the Public Security Bureau deemed this to be replacing genuine opium with fake opium and dismissed him as a punishment, transferring him to the court for handling. Xu Jun, a special agent from the bureau, was appointed to replace him.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>The Fengxian Incident Transferred to the Military Department for Handling: After the Third Cavalry Division stationed in Fengxian had a mutiny, various institutions and legal bodies in the county dispatched representatives to the province and Beijing to appeal. Later, because the representatives Peng Shiheng and Dong Xueshan received a telegram from the county stating that the division commander Zhang Zhankui had asked people to mediate and requested a temporary halt to the appeal, the representatives did not go to Beijing and returned to the Provincial Government. They visited Chairman Gu, and He Haiqiao, the head of the Second Department in charge of the case, met with them, stating that the Provincial Government intended to mediate and reduce the scale of the incident, so Han Shouqian was sent to investigate and resolve the issue, but to no effect. Now, the entire case can be transferred to the Ministry of Military Affairs for handling. The representatives decided to stay in Zhenjiang and await a resolution. It is also reported that Zhang Zhankui, the division commander who caused the incident, will come to the province today to present his case to the authorities.</p>

<p>A Murder Case in the Western Countryside: Gao, the sister-in-law of Yue Shenggeng, a farmer in the western countryside, went to Qi Jia's house in Wantou Village the other night to collect membership fees but did not return overnight. The next morning, she was found dead in a nearby field with multiple knife wounds. The head of the village reported the case to the county for inspection.

<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>The Zhong Family Suffers from Fire: The family of Zhong Xueshu, a farmer from Zhongjiaxia in this county, was celebrating his son's wedding the other day when sparks from the firecrackers fell into the straw pile in the back house, causing a fire. Although they tried their best to put it out, it was ineffective, and the house was burned down. The house of his cousin, Zhong Xuechang, was also affected. A total of thirty to forty houses were burned down. Because the foundation of the Zhong family's house was very high, when the dike broke, the neighbors had entrusted their valuables to the Zhong family, and everything was burned. The estimated losses are around thirty to forty thousand yuan.</p>
<p>A Large Number of Refugees Sent Back: After the dike broke in this county, many refugees without shelter or food went to various counties to receive relief. Now that the relief centers in various counties are closing, the refugees are returning to Gaoyou. The Gaoyou Relief Association has set up a relief center in the Confucius Temple to accommodate them. As of today, more than five hundred people have been accommodated.</p>

<p>[P Feng Huanzhang Lectures at Provincial Shanghai Middle School &gt;</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Provincial Shanghai Middle School held a graduation ceremony for the spring class of the third grade in the auditorium of the junior high school department. Feng Huanrong was invited to give a lecture. Guests Jiang Wenyu, Ren Zhongmin, and others, as well as teachers and students of the school, totaling over a hundred people, attended. After the formal ceremony, the current principal of the school delivered the opening address, followed by Feng's lecture. The main points were as follows: (1) Stating that our country is now in extreme danger, and the land and property left to us by our ancestors are being occupied by powerful enemies. We, as descendants, cannot preserve them. This is shameful and disgraceful. (2) Although our enemy is strong, we cannot give up resisting him because of his power. We must strive for survival under oppression and must fight and resist our enemies. (3) Youth is the vitality of the country. If we want our country to become strong in the future and our people to be relieved of suffering, we must rely on the patriotic youth who are knowledgeable, ambitious, full of spirit and determination to unite and generate a true force for resisting Japan and saving the country. Only then will the country have hope. Subsequently, diplomas were issued, and guests Ren Zhongmin, teacher representative Shen Yizhen, and student representative Tang Dunye gave speeches successively.

<h3>Jinan Avenges Previous Defeat, Malaya Suffers Another Loss</h3>
<p>▲Two to Zero  Overall Dullness</p>
<p>▲Second Half  No Winner</p>
<p>Malaya Will Fight the British Army Team Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Malayan Overseas Chinese Football Team lost again to Jinan University yesterday by a score of two to zero at the China Baseball Field. Three to four thousand people watched. After the fierce battle against Donghua on Sunday, they were somewhat affected. When the Malayans came to Shanghai last time, they won 3-0. Jinan returned the favor with a 2-0 victory. The crowd hoped Jinan would avenge their previous defeat. Yesterday's situation was completely in favor of Jinan. In the first half, Chen Zhenhe and Qiu Dongyan each scored a goal. In the second half, Chen and Qiu were injured and left the field. There were also injuries on the Malayan side. As a result, the situation became even more dull. The referee was Jiang Xiangqing. Tomorrow afternoon, Malaya will play against the British Army United Team at the same location.</p>
<p>▲Jinan Lineup</p>
<p>Chen Buzhang, Gu Shangquan, Jiang Shanjing, Liang Shutang, Feng Yunyou, Chen Fuzhong, Fu Hexuan, Qiu Dongyan, Jiang Zongmian, Chen Zhenhe (out), Yang Baosen, Wen Dingxin (out), Mei Hongshi</p>
<p>▲Malaya Lineup</p>
<p>Huang Jinbai, Xu Jintang, Yu Zhuohou, Gan Jinlu, Jian Deyao, Huang Kehou, Liu Jinrong, Guan Xinnian, Xie Jinfu, Deng Yueyun, Xia Haishan</p>
<p>▲Dull Situation</p>
<p>Malaya remained subjugated throughout the game. The opportunities for the forwards to get the ball were extremely rare. In the first half, Jinan besieged the Malayan goal from time to time. In the second half, Jinan replaced Chen Zhenhe and Qiu Dongyan due to injuries, giving Malaya a chance to recover. Both sides made aimless attacks in the end, resulting in a dull game.</p>
<p>▲Goalkeeping Spotlight</p>
<p>In this situation, the goalkeeper was the most prominent player. Malayan goalkeeper Huang Jinbai, accepting his fate, pounced up and down, rushing forward and defending backward. His performance was indeed solid and was praised by the audience, who called him the "Iron Gate," which was well-deserved.</p>
<p>▲Weak Midfield</p>
<p>Malaya's defeat was influenced by the cold weather, which greatly reduced their activity. However, the weakness of the midfield line cannot be ignored, allowing the enemy to approach from both sides. The inability of the midfielders to support the forwards and the lack of coordination among the forwards, as well as the lack of direction in passing the ball, were all major problems that affected their strength.</p>
<p>▲Jinan's Pressure</p>
<p>Jinan controlled the entire game and was very pleased with themselves. The changes in the midfield and defense did not affect their strength. Gu Shangquan's defense was steady and reliable. Feng Yunyou's midfield also attacked the goal many times, showing great potential. The Malayan goalkeeper, Zhang, made many saves, but Jinan could have won by a wider margin if they had scored on more opportunities. All the Jinan players performed very well.</p>
<p>▲Chen and Qiu Score Consecutively</p>
<p>Jinan dared to attack as soon as they got the ball. They approached the city walls again and again, but were repeatedly blocked by the iron gate. Ten minutes into the game, Mei Hongmai advanced straight on the right side, approaching the right corner, and hooked the ball into the middle. Chen Zhenhe was about to attack the goal, but Malayan left-back Xu Jintang saw the situation was not good and cleared the ball out of bounds. Fu Hefeng's corner kick was excellent. Chen Zhenhe followed the momentum and shot a flat ball downward from five yards to the left of the goal. The ball was too powerful. Huang Jinbai squatted down, caught it, but still bounced into the corner of the goal, giving Jinan a 1-0 lead. Ten minutes later, Qiu Dongyan shot from fifteen yards away, right in the center, breaking through the goal again. Jinan won the first half with a score of 2-0.</p>
<p>▲Key Players Injured</p>
<p>The second half was similar, but five minutes into the game, Chen Zhenhe injured his leg and could not continue. Jiang Zongmian replaced him, which was not as effective. As a result, Malaya saw a chance to recover. Jinan proceeded cautiously. Then, Huang Jinbai repeatedly made dangerous saves, maintaining the original score. Almost half an hour later, Qiu Dongyan also injured his foot and left the field. Jinan did not replace him, continuing the game with ten players. Malaya also ended up playing with only ten players.</p>
<p>▲Battle Against the British Army</p>
<p>Tomorrow afternoon at 3:00 PM, Malaya will play against the Shanghai British Army United Team at the same location. The situation is different, and the Malayan athletes are still expected to work hard.</p>
<h3>West Qing Basketball Group A Championship Finals Tonight: John vs. Pirates</h3>
<p>▲Yesterday's Group B Finals: Morning Star Avenges Loss</p>
<p>▲Shanghai Middle School Loses to Nian Yi by 21 to 27</p>
<p>In the second final of the West Qing Basketball Group B Championship last night, Morning Star relied on its solid lineup and accurate shooting to defeat Shanghai Middle School Affiliated High School by a score of 27 to 21. Each team has won once, and the championship will depend on the third final tomorrow night. Also, Red Team defeated Jinan 38 to 36, and Xia Guang defeated Jiang Wan 37 to 31. Tonight is the Group A Championship final, John vs. Pirates. Pirates have won every game, and John has only unfortunately lost once to Mai Ling. Tonight's game will again fill the West Qing Gymnasium. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲Red Team Defeats Jinan The Red Team's skills are improving day by day, far beyond what they used to be, while Jinan has declined and lacks energy. In the first half, the Red Team was in full force and led 24 to 16. In the second half, Jinan's Huang Zhaolin tried to retaliate, but in the end, they lost to the Red Team by one point, with a score of 36 to 38.</p>
<p>▲Xia Guang Defeats Jiang Wan The situation in this game was similar to the previous one. Xia Guang's performance was average at first, but recently they have made the same progress as the Red Team, while Jiang Wan is in a similar situation as Jinan. In the first half, Xia Guang won 23 to 13. In the second half, Jiang Wan won 18 to 14, but Xia Guang still won overall, with a score of 37 to 31.</p>
<p>▲Morning Star Defeats Shanghai Middle School This was the second final of the Group B Championship. Shanghai Middle School won the previous game with a score of 31 to 24. The situation in last night's game was even more tense. Both sides were on high alert. In the first half, Shanghai Middle School led 13 to 5. Morning Star worked hard to catch up, making it 13 to 12. Morning Star was only one point behind. In the second half, Morning Star's morale suddenly surged, and they made great efforts, coupled with dense defense, making it impossible for the opponent to take advantage. Shanghai Middle School was seen circling around, unable to find a solution, while their defense was empty, and they were attacked by the opponent from time to time. In the end, Morning Star retaliated with a score of 37 to 21.</p>
<p>▲Morning Star Fouls Points ▲Shanghai Middle School Fouls Points</p>

<h3>A Mirror for Warlords</h3>
<p>Mr. He Yingqin recently stated in a speech that the Chinese National Revolution has only defeated the warlords and completed the first stage of the revolution.</p>
<p>We want to ask Mr. He:</p>
<p>Which warlords have been defeated?</p>
<p>Which warlords have been resurrected?</p>
<p>Which revolutionary soldiers have become warlords?</p>
<p>To give a clear answer to these questions, we must first explain what a warlord is. Let me give a definition:</p>
<p>[Overpowers the master and acts on his own,</p>
<p>Squanders military pay like dirt.</p>
<p>Resists not when robbers enter the house,</p>
<p>Forbids the master from chasing the thieves away.]</p>
<p>This is a mirror to examine warlords. Every soldier only needs to compare his actions with this mirror to know whether he is a warlord. If we want to know the truth about the National Revolution and warlords, we only need to hold this mirror up to the soldiers of the whole country and everything will be clear.</p>
<h3>The Truth About Xi Shi</h3>
<p>— Yi Zang</p>
<p>My younger brother, Yi Chao, previously worked at the Jiyang County government. He recently came to Shanghai and spoke to me in great detail about Xi Shi. So, I take up my pen to record it and offer it to the readers. Xi Shi's real name was Zheng Dan, her Dharma name was Cai Ping, and her historical name was Yi Guang. Xi Shi was her sobriquet. Her father's surname was Zheng, his name was Luo, and his courtesy name was Chi Min. Her mother's surname was Shi. Her father was a live-in son-in-law of the Shi family of Shijia Village, Mengshan Mountain Yang, outside Jiyang County. The village was west of the stream, hence the name Xi Shi (West Shi). The village is also known as Ningluo Village. Because she grew up in her mother's family, she was named Xi Shi. The stream is also known as Huansha Stream, named after Xi Shi washing silk there. This stream is now called Huanjiang River. Some mistakenly say that Zheng Dan is the name of Dong Shi, but in fact, Dong Shi never existed. It was fabricated by later enthusiasts. It is said that Xi Shi's appearance was not very beautiful, only a round face and red complexion. Without makeup, she was already the same as the powdered and adorned crowd. When she was seventeen, while washing silk in the Ruoye Stream, Fan Li happened to be looking for a beauty for the King of Yue. He saw a maiden by the stream, graceful and delicate, with a charming demeanor. Li followed her home and obtained her parents' permission to present her to the King of Yue. At first, Xi Shi did not want to be the concubine of a king from another country, but she was moved by Fan Li's persuasion and agreed to go. At that time, the King of Yue was eager for revenge. He told her, "Can you avenge me? Since I was defeated by Wu, I have been agonizing and thinking hard, enduring hardship and tasting gall. I have no plan to implement. Today, only you can avenge my humiliation and revitalize the ancestral shrines." After speaking, tears flowed like a spring. Xi Shi knelt down and wept, saying, "If there is any use for this concubine, I will not hesitate to die ten thousand times. I hope to offer this concubine to Wu immediately. If I do not avenge Yue's feud with Wu, I would rather die under ten thousand blades." The next day, the King of Yue sent her to the Wu palace. The King of Wu was delighted and neglected state affairs. When the King of Yue was in his twenty-second year, he defeated Wu in one battle. Xi Shi returned to Yue and went home. She was thirty-six years old. Her father had died early, and only her mother was alive. The family was still poor. After her mother died, she was grief-stricken and wanted to commit suicide in the Huanxi Stream, but she did not succeed. She then went to the Qiantang River and took the opportunity to throw herself into the river and died. She was fifty-two years old at the time. Some people say that she did not return to her hometown, or that she committed suicide in the Huanxi Stream, or that she was drowned in the river by the people of Wu, but all of these are incorrect. During the Han Dynasty, she was posthumously honored as a true patriot. Her descendants have now moved to Xiaoshan, and the old site has been destroyed without a trace. However, the Jiyang Zhi records that when Wang Ji of the Ming Dynasty visited Ningluo Mountain, he inscribed the two large characters "Huan Xi" on the stone wall. It is said to be the handwriting of Wang Youjun, but it is also incomplete and unrecognizable. In the late Qing Dynasty, Chen Weiwen, a native of Jiyang, raised funds to expand the land east of the ruins by more than ten acres and built the Huanxi Pavilion. Next to the pavilion is the Xizi Temple. Behind the temple is the Red Powder Pond. All visitors who pass by here cannot help but sigh with emotion.</p>
<h3>World Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>France Needs Sparrows: Many places in France love to eat sparrows, considering them a delicacy, just as sparrows are included in banquets in the Shanghai area of our country. Therefore, sparrows are extremely necessary in France. Almost all of the sparrows in the country cannot preserve their lives. Fortunately, they continue to breed, and often satiate their appetites. However, last year, for some reason, an epidemic spread, killing most of the sparrows. As a result, the French, although eager to eat, suffered from a lack of sparrows. Coincidentally, Hungary had an abundance of sparrows. The unemployed there made a living by catching sparrows. They transported the live sparrows to France, where they were killed and sold. It is said that their method of catching sparrows is to first use a water gun to spray water on them, startling them. Then, they use a hat or handkerchief to catch them, with almost no failures. After catching them, they sell them piecemeal to local game shops, earning half a penny per bird. Because the sales in France are very brisk, this greatly sustains the lives of some of the unemployed in Hungary.</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>— Rong</p>
<p>Madam Shen Peizhen, a veteran member of the Republican Party, came to Shanghai previously because of breast pain. She was in financial difficulty and could not afford medical treatment. Fortunately, Mr. Feng from southern Guangdong took on the medical expenses. She was treated at the Sacred Heart Hospital on Ningguo Road in Yangshupu for several months, which cost a great deal. Lawyer Zheng Yuxiu also provided financial assistance. However, her illness eventually became incurable, and she passed away in the hospital on January 5th. There were no funds for her funeral. Mr. Wang Yiting, a Shanghai gentleman, purchased a coffin and temporarily placed it in the Huzhou Guild Hall in Zhabei. Her nephew, Shen Shixiong, has been weeping and seeking assistance from all sides for several days in order to transport the coffin back to her hometown. Shen was a major figure in the revolution. Such an ending is truly regrettable.</p>
<h3>Colds</h3>
<p>— Qiushui</p>
<p>In our minds, the most minor and common ailment is the common cold. However, in Europe and America, it is quite the opposite. They attach great importance to colds. At the first sign of a stuffy nose or cough, they must seek medical attention and take medicine, daring not to be negligent. The reason is that a cold is a precursor to lung disease. If it is not treated early, there will be future troubles. However, the medical community has yet to find a specific cure for colds. If treatment is not started at the onset, it will be difficult to eradicate later. The reason why people catch colds and where the cold germs are located have long been difficult questions for European and American medical scientists.</p>
<p>However, according to recent news, cold germs have already been discovered. It is not yet known who made the discovery. What is known is that the size of the germ is extremely small, able to freely pass through the most sophisticated water filters used by doctors, and difficult to see even with a microscope.</p>
<p>However, omnipotent scientists do not abandon their work because of this. They have tried many methods to obtain some of these germs and conduct detailed experiments. After the experiments were completed, they injected them into chimpanzees and human bodies to observe the phenomenon of incubation and reproduction. I know that in a few years, there will be a specific medicine for treating colds, and the sound of violent coughing and spitting in theaters and teahouses will no longer be heard. How shallow is the blessing of science to mankind!</p>
<p>Doctors can describe the harm that colds do to human health. However, this is only its direct damage. The indirect losses to the country and society caused by people losing their health due to colds are even greater. A few years ago, an American sociologist conducted a field investigation and published a table of the losses caused by workers nationwide being absent from work due to colds. The loss of wages within a year was as high as 200 million pounds, which is shocking. Our people should pay attention to this. From now on, do not regard colds as minor illnesses and be reluctant to seek medical treatment.</p>
<h3>Records of Sights and Sounds in the Old Capital</h3>
<p>— Zhu An</p>
<p>▲Toys</p>
<p>In the old capital, the temple fairs in the eastern and western districts, the Dong'an Market, and the various shops during the New Year are most attractive to visitors, especially children's toys. Stalls are lined up, showing a variety of them. I once saw a painting by Qian Shunju of the Song Dynasty in the Forbidden City, depicting a hawker's cart. Women led children, gathering to watch and compete to buy. This is exactly the same scene. If you want to study folk customs, there is no better place to go. To summarize, there are several things that are not commonly seen elsewhere. One is the "Shaking Empty Bell." The "Yanjing Zaji" says that it is made by cutting bamboo into two short tubes, with a small shaft in the middle, connected but not broken. The two ends are solid, and the middle is hollowed out. A rope is wound around the small shaft, and the two ends are pulled to shake it, producing a sound like a huge bell, which is very pleasant to hear. Skilled artisans can throw it into the air, let it fall repeatedly, and the sound will not stop. Or they can spread their hands apart, pull the rope straight, and the empty bell will float back and forth from left to right, without any force and without falling to the ground. This is called "The Immortal Crossing the Bridge," which is a type of skill for street performers. Many children in the city learn it. Another is "Ox Spittle." It is made of glass in the shape of a gourd, and the tube is held in the mouth to breathe, causing a sound to vibrate from the bottom. However, it is easily broken if you are not careful. Many dilapidated shops sell this item during the New Year. Another is "Kneaded Rice Figurines." An iron wire is used as the frame, and various colors are dyed with glutinous rice flour to create figures from dramas, no more than two or three inches in size. The beards, eyebrows, swords, and halberds are all meticulously created. It is made purely by hand, without the use of other objects. It is truly a superb skill. In the northern dialect, glutinous rice is called "jiangmi," hence the name. Another is the "God of Wealth Whip." Candied hawthorn fruits are strung together to make a long whip, reaching three or four feet in length. It is also sold to children at the beginning of the year. It is beautifully named the "God of Wealth Whip" to please women and children. It is neither delicious nor playable. Another is the "Slingshot." Strong wood is covered with cowhide to make a crossbow, filled with mud pellets, and fired by pulling it. It can kill birds and sparrows, and is probably a legacy of Han Yan's golden pellets. Those who make toys are mostly Manchus. They have some talent and intelligence but no permanent occupation, so they use their skills to extend and transform them to make a living. Many of them are clever and delightful, exceeding expectations. I once saw someone in the market using verbal commands to have two insects fight each other. At first, I thought their training was so precise that the price would be high. Upon closer inspection, I realized that they were fake and were pulled by extremely fine hairs, which were hidden in the sleeves. Toys are becoming more and more novel, and the price is also getting cheaper. Making a living is not bad, but unfortunately, most people cannot last long and have no way to sell them elsewhere.</p>
<h3>The Story of War Horses and Double Towers (7)</h3>
<p>— Seeking Happiness Master Qi</p>
<p>Chapter One: A Peerless Courtesan Leads a Lonely Life Yearning for Her Beautiful Companion, An Overseas Student Wanders and Forges a Strange Romance</p>
<p>Usually, when she was at home relaxing, she also thought about improving her own knowledge. She hired two or three famous professors from the education field, who came to her house at fixed times every day to teach her reading and writing. Even the English that was necessary for foreign relations was being learned. She had originally graduated from elementary school when she was young, and had some basic literacy. With her intelligence and diligent practice, her progress was remarkable. She could barely handle ordinary letters and browse newspapers in Chinese, and she could also speak English fluently, showing it off everywhere. What was even more enviable was her writing of Huang Tingjian's large characters, which were strong, upright, and beautiful, praised by everyone. She almost became a female calligrapher. However, these talents in speech and writing, apart from gaining a false reputation, still did not benefit her in any way. Because she was already very famous, simply adding some refined and civilized titles would not be useful in practice. Since she could not rely on these superficial skills to achieve any outstanding career, she became an antique that was only beautiful on the outside, stuck in the middle, neither high nor low. Fortunately, there was another thing. In order to attach herself to elegance and approach celebrities, she had the opportunity to interact with outstanding young students from various schools. She took the opportunity to make a plan to slowly search among these innocent and pure students for a young man with a solid foundation in morality, intelligence, and physical fitness. She would implement her long-held plan of choosing a husband and assisting him. First, she would use love to influence him, then use methods to train him, and then use money and strategies to cultivate him. She believed that she could personally create a promising and well-behaved husband, achieving her lifelong expectation. She paid attention to this for some time, and sure enough, heaven answered her prayers. A student who met her qualifications fell into her hands for her to test. This person was named An Yutian, and his ancestral home was in a remote mountainous area with strong local customs. He had a large clan and built a famous Anjia Village. His father was the village chief of Anjia Village. He had a solid and spacious residence and two shops in the village, and owned more than ten hectares of fertile land. He was undoubtedly a wealthy household in the area. An Yutian was the only son in the family and was very much loved by his parents. Therefore, his parents hoped to cultivate him into a knowledgeable and accomplished son who could carry on the family business. Since he was a child, they were willing to send him to study in other places. Because the local customs were closed and he could not receive a good and advanced education, they did not want to delay his studies. From elementary school to high school, he graduated from famous provincial schools in the provincial capital. Last year, due to the issue of higher education, he heard that only Peking University was the most famous, so he came north to study and was admitted to a university, majoring in law and political science. Now, he was a mature young man of twenty-one years old. He was handsome, talented, and promising. He had a prominent demeanor, bright eyes, thick eyebrows, a full jaw, a fresh complexion, and broad shoulders. At first glance, he was known to have a strong and healthy physique. He had always been known for his all-around athletic ability at school sports meets. He was also deeply accomplished in all other courses and never fell behind. He could be considered a top student.</p>

<h3>Financial and Gold Markets Slightly Active</h3>
<p>▲Continued Slight Improvement, Three Taels and Zero Fen: Yesterday, the price of gold continued to rise, with occasional fluctuations. The overall high and low was more than eight taels. In the end, it rose by three taels and zero fen. This was because the February to March swap was imminent, and various parties were holding on. However, the sentiment of each exchange was different, and the atmosphere was still stable. The opening was high, and it immediately broke through the 700-tael mark. This was actually due to the silver market reporting a drop the previous day. Afterwards, Hengxing and other sellers were active, and things continued to decline. As for foreign exchange, after a sharp rise, it fell again, and had already fallen below 693 taels. However, various parties bought again, turning weakness into strength. The market was peaceful, with fluctuations of only one or two taels. In the end, it was calculated to be more than 96 taels, and the exchange rate also had no special honor or disgrace.</p>
<p>▲Frequent Changes in the Morning Market: It rose by six taels and one qian as soon as it opened in the morning, to 699 taels and five qian. Although the large bar was reduced by one-sixteenth the previous day, the forward price did not change. However, some people were wary of last Saturday's price, and American silver fell by one-quarter, and private telegrams also fell slightly by one-eighth. However, the market sentiment was upward, and Yuanda Yong and others were buying, so it rose again to 701 taels. However, Zhifeng Yong, Hengxing, Chunyuan Yong, Yuanmaoyong, etc., had already sold off. As for British gold, it could be settled at 125 in April, and American gold at 32.8125 yuan. Japanese banks were willing to come out, so it was lower by three or four taels, calculated at 97 taels and two qian. Tongrenchang and others were not enthusiastic about buying, and it immediately rose by two taels to 99 taels and two qian. When the British gold price was announced, it did not move, and it was 97 taels and two qian. Moreover, retail investors were selling off. Before long, it increased to eight taels and four qian. Later, British gold in February could be traded at 11 pence 1875. Also, American gold was 32 yuan, difficult to sell. On the trading floor, Hengxing, Fuyu, Dachencheng, and other hedging parties were not competing to sell, causing the price to suddenly fall downstream. At 10:15, it suddenly became 92 taels and five qian. In an instant, the bank absorbed American dollars at 3 yuan in April. Also, Zhifeng Yong, Chunyuan Yong, Yuanxing Yong, Tong Taichang, Dalian Gang, Yuanmaoyong, etc., successively entered, so the price suddenly turned upward. By noon, it was also rumored that the Indian exchange rate had fallen by a small amount. As a result, the market became more firm and actually rose to 98 taels and two qian. The noon closing was 98 taels, and it was suppressed again to more than seven taels, so goods closed at seven and a half taels. However, in a moment, it was raised to more than eight taels. The announced price was still 744 taels, with a premium of about 50 taels.</p>
<p>▲Transactions Not Very Active: Transactions on the counter were not very active. According to statistics, Tong Taichang, Yuanda Yong, Qian Changxiang, Yuanxing Yong, and Yuancheng Yong all bought. Dachencheng and Yuanmaoyong both sold more than they bought. Futaiheng, Taifengcheng, and Hongkang Yong all sold. Hengxing sold in order to hedge exchange rates. Yuantai, Chunyuan Yong, Fuyu, Meifeng Yong, and Dakang, etc., had unpredictable entries and exits. In the afternoon, Dachencheng, Hongkang Yong, Tong Taichang, and Huixiang, etc., all bought. Zhifeng Yong and Yuantai initially bought and then sold. Yuanda Yong, Hengxing, Yuanmaoyong, Futaiheng, Fuyu, etc., all sold. Speculators rarely entered or exited. The Guangdong gang sold more than a thousand bars, and the Dalian gang's entries and exits were no more than two or three hundred bars.</p>
<p>▲Gradual Return to Peace in the Afternoon Market: The market opened in the afternoon at 98 taels and five qian, then from eight taels to eight taels and eight qian. However, Yuanmaoyong and others sold, and it immediately dropped by one tael. At 2:45, it was 96 taels and seven qian. Before long, hedging parties and Hongkang Yong, etc., bought in, and the recent British gold was calculated at 1875, and the Guangdong gang's purchase of American dollars was calculated at 32.75 yuan, so at 3:00, it was 98 taels and seven qian. Unexpectedly, Hengxing sold off its hedges, and various retail accounts followed suit, so the price could not be sustained and gradually fell by four taels. At 3:45, it was 94 taels and seven qian. However, the number of bars on the trading floor was still very small. After entering, sellers stopped, and Tong Taichang, etc., slightly entered. At 4:00, it increased to 97 taels. Fuyu, Zhifeng Yongda, Dachencheng, etc., sold slightly, and it decreased by one tael. At 4:20, it was 95 taels and seven qian. The closing price at 4:30 was 96 taels and seven qian, an increase of three taels and three qian compared to last Saturday. Since last Friday, it has risen by more than 19 taels in total. After the closing, Hengxing still had sales, so it retreated to 96 taels 12 qian. According to the whole day, the maximum was 701 taels and the minimum was 692 taels and five qian, with a return of eight taels and five qian. Goods opened in the morning at nine and a half taels, closed at noon at seven and a half, and in the afternoon at eight and a half, with a closing price of six and a half taels. The announced price had a premium of about 46-47 taels. The book entry was 700 taels to 698 taels, with 700 taels of water added. In the afternoon, it was 699 taels. Red bars arrived continuously, but Yufeng Yong still bought them, with the price increasing by ten taels.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Without Major Gains or Losses</h3>
<p>▲Bank Transactions Also Ordinary</p>
<p>Yesterday, British and American silver markets both reported a drop, but the market was stable. The British and American exchange rates fell slightly again, with HSBC quoting only a slight drop of .25 in the Indian exchange rate and a slight increase of half a mark in the German exchange rate. All others had no increase or decrease. The internal British, American, and Indian exchange rates were firm and then weakened, becoming stable at noon and in the afternoon. As a result, compared to last Saturday, British gold had no difference, and American dollars decreased by .125, still due to the small exchange rate. However, the gold market rose slightly by more than three taels. There were no major domestic or international news, and bank transactions were also ordinary. British gold traded for about 560,000 pounds, and the gold gangs bought slightly. Japanese commercial banks still sold. American dollars were traded for 450,000 yuan.

As for the various situations of collection, settlement, and transactions, at the current year-end, it is also the customary general period for giving accounts to the east. There is no expansion to speak of. Naturally, major business will be reported.</p>
<p>▲Overnight Loan Rates: [Silver Loans] In the morning, the selling pressure eased slightly, and market sentiment improved slightly. As a result, the morning market was seven hao and a half higher than the previous day, at seven qian, one fen, and five li.

[Silver Discounts] The morning market was one qian, and the afternoon market was eight fen. The premium remained white. The bank list price was four fen.</p>

<h3>Fluctuating Securities and Bond Prices</h3>
<p>▲ Nien-Kuan Consolidated Salt Tax Recently Rose by More Than One Yuan</p>
<p>▲ Other Bonds Generally Continued to Decline, with Forward Prices Showing Greater Weakness</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market conditions for various bonds on the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange showed that only a few types of spot bonds were available, with sparse transactions. The futures market was generally not quiet, but major players remained cautious and most trading was done in small lots. The overall trend for various bonds was generally stable, with mixed movements and considerable confusion. As there were no new developments in the overall situation and the environment remained sluggish, there were no large-scale movements in and out of the market. Prices only shifted according to temporary supply and demand conditions. As a result, there was no consistent trend across various boards and prices, with a mixed bag of rises and falls compared to the previous weekend. Among them, the February 20th Customs Bond rose by one yuan and six jiao in January, the Consolidated Tax Bond rose by one yuan and two jiao in January, and the Salt Tax Bond rose by eight jiao in January. Other bonds generally continued to weaken, but apart from larger falls in forward contracts, the remaining fluctuations were minor. In addition, although the Disbandment Bonds spot price differed by as much as seven yuan and a half from last week, this was due to the draw for the winning numbers and not a substantial actual difference. Observing the shape of the bond market, it is very chaotic and its future trend will continue to depend on the development of uncertain circumstances. It is estimated that the total spot transactions for the day amounted to 16,000 yuan, futures transactions in the morning amounted to over 2.3 million, and transactions in the afternoon amounted to over 2.1 million, totaling 4,485,000 yuan, of which less than 600,000 yuan was for the February contract.</p>
<p>| Bond Type | Futures Contract | Previous | Opening | Closing | Change from Last Week | Volume |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|</p>

<h3>Stable Cotton Yarn Market</h3>
<p>The yarn market is extremely quiet with very few new developments. Due to the escalating Japanese invasion, public sentiment is depressed. Furthermore, with the settlement period approaching, trading in the market is particularly light, resembling a winding down. The situation is very bleak. With the actual currency showing a tight monetary policy despite appearances to the contrary, no trading firms are showing any signs of excitement.</p>
<p>▲ Recent Bids for Fine Yarn at 5-6 Jiao. The Pre-Market Opening Price is Flat, and Trading is Particularly Quiet.</p>
<p>No one is bidding for any of the months, with no price changes. In the afternoon, the price for the current month tightened, rising by 6 jiao. Middle month also rose by 2.5 jiao, while the far month remained flat. Total transactions for the day were 8,100 bales. It was found that Dafu sold 400 bales, Yukang sold 300 bales, and Tongyu sold 250 bales. Xincheng bought 400 bales, and Yichang bought 600 bales. The closing prices are listed on the left:</p>
<p>| Contract | Closing Price | Change | Open Interest | Contract | Closing Price | Change | Open Interest |</p>

Internal transactions accounted for 35 bales. Market conditions are flat.</p>
<h3>Listless Cotton Market</h3>
<p>The cotton market is unusually weak. As actual transactions are stagnant, factories intend to cut back, and the overseas cotton market is also flat. There is no great vitality. Therefore, sellers are very calm, but most buyers are holding tight because the base is too dry and remain unwilling to loosen their grip. The outlook is uncertain.</p>
<p>▲ Flat and Soft Han Standard. The Han Standard opened flat in the pre-market, with American cotton down 5 fen to 1 jiao in the near term, and flat in the long term. Market sentiment rose slightly in the afternoon, with each month up 5 fen to 1 jiao. Total transactions for the day were 38,200 dan. It was found that Tongyu sold 1,400 dan, Shenchang sold 1,600 dan, and Xinhua sold 800 dan. Gongtai bought 1,400 dan, Guanji bought 1,300 dan, Xincheng bought 1,300 dan, and Yuanda bought 1,600 dan.

<h3>Indian and British Cotton Industry Weekly News</h3>
<p>▲ Bombay Futures Market Closed</p>
<p>▲ Bombay</p>
<p>Although the futures market remained closed last week, the trend remained strong. Oomra cotton remained in short supply. Unless demand decreases, this price will continue to be maintained. Japan is purchasing American cotton to meet its needs. European manufacturers are also purchasing American cotton as a cheaper alternative to Indian cotton. In terms of spot goods, local manufacturers slightly increased their purchases to meet urgent needs. Purchases from Europe and the Far East have been cancelled. Therefore, the transportation to those regions has been completely cut off. The statistics for the past week are appended below (in thousands of bales):</p>
<p>|  | 1930 | 1931 |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| Shipped to Europe | 188 | 69 |</p>
<p>| Cumulative since September 1st | 973 | 400 |</p>
<p>| Shipped to China | 125 | 116 |</p>
<p>| Total receipts |  |  |</p>
<p>| Weekend inventory | 666 | 390 |</p>
<p>| Shipped to Japan | 437 | 186 |</p>
<p>| Cumulative since September 1st | 754 | 389 |</p>
<p>| Other regions | 7 | 18 |</p>
<p>| Total exports |  |  |</p>
<p>▲ Liverpool</p>
<p>Spot demand showed slight improvement last week. In terms of futures, the situation was very unstable due to the Lancashire issue and the Indian boycott movement. However, the trend remained strong. Sentiment was better due to hopes for the European economic situation. Egyptian cotton initially weakened due to unfavorable foreign conditions, but then turned firm.</p>
<h3>Grain Prices: River Below Rice Market Weakens</h3>
<p>▲ Shanghai South</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were approximately 20 suppliers. Due to the sunny weather, sales in the city were sparse. Outbound shipments of top-grade rice were acceptable, but shipments of medium-grade rice were lackluster. The price of thick japonica rice has temporarily stabilized. As for thin indica rice, accumulation slightly caused clogged taste buds. In this area, shipments of mid-grade rice were chosen slightly, while shipments of lower quality rice were minimal. Although shipments of Shanghai foreign-style premium rice have been dwindling, the market remains mediocre due to the cheap price of foreign rice.</p>
<p>▲ New Wharf</p>
<p>Market conditions are difficult to activate. Although the various shops near the market are enthusiastic, sales are showing stability and even signs of loosening. Two trucks of premium rice arrived, and Chengyi and Zhenxing continued to handle thick and thin japonica rice, as well as foreign-style premium rice from the port, but the taste was unhealthy. The price was slightly lower and subject to immediate sales. The price was comparable to previous settlements. Yesterday, Taikoo Sugar Company shipped 6,000 bags of small-grain rice. The opening price has been reduced by 2 jiao.</p>
<h3>Both Futures and Spot Prices for Foreign Rice are Soft</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market showed signs of weakness again. As foreign firms continued to express interest in selling, the local market was already saturated. Although spot sales in the local market were active, there was a continuous arrival of large quantities. As the Lunar New Year is approaching, most sellers were eager to unload their goods, causing the market price to fall by 1 or 2 jiao. New futures transactions have stopped, and returned goods are also showing weakness. The United Market opened with 1,200 bags of small-grain spot rice, priced at 9.5 yuan. One thousand bags of Saigon rice were priced at 10.075 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Active for Near and Distant Months</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the prices for each month were initially stable. Due to the price of foreign wheat falling by about 1 or 2 jiao, and the increasingly unfavorable domestic situation, market sentiment was very quiet, with prices similar to those of the previous weekend. However, due to rumors that Fuxin's standards, other than the current month, would require an increased price for withdrawals after the current month, the trading firms became very active, and forward prices rose accordingly. Until the afternoon opening, the current month continued to show strong purchasing momentum from trading firms, while forward prices rose as outside buyers took advantage of the factories' sluggish sales and absorbed supplies. Both months showed signs of activity. However, it is difficult to predict whether further changes will occur in the current month, which is approaching the Lunar New Year. As a result, the current month rose by 1 fen and 7.5 li compared to the previous week, February and March rose by 1.5 fen, April and May rose by 7.5 li, and June rose by 5 li.</p>
<h3>June Wheat Plunges Amid Heavy Selling</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the futures wheat market in the morning, each month initially showed flatness and weakness. The price of foreign wheat fell by 1 or 2 jiao, and the factories were mostly on the sidelines. The market for the current month once fell to 3 yuan, 2 jiao, and 9 fen, while forward prices also fell by 1 or 2 fen. Until the afternoon opening, the market for the current month remained stable, while forward prices improved by 1 or 2 fen compared to the morning as the flour market turned upward and market sentiment improved slightly. However, the June contract suddenly plunged due to a surge in selling. This situation with the new wheat is noteworthy. As a result, the current month was unchanged, February improved by 1 fen, March improved by 2 fen, April and May were unchanged, and June fell by 7 fen.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Refined Granulated and White Sugar Trade Quietly and Prices are Stable</h3>
<p>▲ Sharp Fall in Xinqing Sugar Opening Price</p>
<p>Yesterday, news from sugar production areas reported that the price of raw Cuban sugar was 1.1875, up 0.3125 from the previous report. The price of New York futures sugar for March was 1.09, up 1 fen, for May it was 1.14, up 2 fen, and for September it was 1.24, and for December it was 1.3, each up 1 fen. There was still no change in the current and forward prices of Java sugar. The buying interest in the Shanghai Sugar Association market remained quiet. Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse granulated white high-quality goods traded slightly at 9 taels and 7.5 qian. Regular goods were priced at 9 taels and 7 qian, but few inquired. Dutch red sugar No. 8 was 8 taels and 4 qian, Dutch fine white sugar was 11 taels and 6.5 qian, and medium granulated white sugar No. 20 was 9 taels and 6 qian. The market was also flat. Taikoo sugar B was 12 taels and 3 qian, with few buyers. HX was 11 taels and 8 qian, HM was 11 taels and 5 qian, and industrial sugar was 4 qian and 7.5 fen, with relatively active transactions and a firm market sentiment. The factory price of Yiyi goods B mark opened at 7 taels and 7.5 qian, with a few slightly sold. There were more than 20 packages of domestic Xinqing sugar opened for sale yesterday at 7 taels and 8.5 qian, and the market seemed to be declining.</p>
<h3>Zhabei Goods: Xiamen Candied Tangerines and Land Prices Rise</h3>
<p>The first batch of Xiamen candied tangerines arrived, trading at 19 taels. It was recently heard that the Jinan import port of Taikoo Company also had shipments arriving. According to letters from cargo customers, the local land price has increased by nearly one yuan, and the color of this batch of goods is also more reddish, so the market situation shows signs of tightening. Samples should be available today. If the goods are not bad, they should fetch a good price.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Overseas Silk Telegrams Unchanged</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market in the foreign trading houses in Shanghai remained unchanged. Overseas, the market for Sino-Japanese silk sales remained sluggish. Silk telegrams were unchanged. American firms were still considering suppressing prices to replenish their factory inventory, but the factories' losses were too large and they were still unwilling to sell. Yesterday, only Xinfu and others imported 20 bales of dry Daqing silk, and Kechang imported 5 bales of coarse yellow silk. Prices remained flat and weak.</p>
<h3>Vigorous Trading of Gao Zhuang Fine Eyebrow Tea</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Baochang Foreign Company of the English Firm vigorously searched for high-grade fine eyebrow tea from Wuyuan and Tunxi. Qiahe and Tongfu, etc., also had purchasing interest. The city traded over 400 boxes in total. However, the opening prices were quoted, with the core-extracted goods ranging from 127 to 135 taels, and ordinary goods ranging from 105 to 110 taels, a significant drop of 30 to 40 taels from before.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Sichuan Firms Continue to Purchase Serge and Gabardine</h3>
<p>The wool fabric market has remained quiet recently, and prices are still falling. However, retail sales are still somewhat strong. The Sichuan firms stationed in Shanghai still purchased some goods yesterday and today. The traded goods were mostly assorted gabardine, checkered gabardine, and plain iron-gray serge. Other wool fabrics were rarely inquired about, so serge and gabardine are currently the best-selling items, and prices are also lower than last month. For example, Ningfeng's yuan-colored blue-gray gabardine, which sold for 3 taels and 7.5 qian last month, was traded by Sichuan firms yesterday for only 3 taels and 5 qian.</p>
<h3>Metal Factory Nail Prices Trending Downward</h3>
<p>Local factory yuan nails have recently seen a very large outflow, so many new factories have opened. However, prices cannot be unified as a result. The highest price per bin is 6 taels and 2.5 qian, and the lowest is 5 taels and 8.5 qian. The market has opened with as many as two or three thousand bins in recent days. Looking at the future market, it is feared that prices will fall further.</p>
<h3>Short Supply and Rising Prices for New Wire</h3>
<p>Although transactions of new wire have not seen any development recently, the inventory is extremely low, and market sentiment is good. Therefore, prices have been rising steadily. The current market price is estimated at 12 taels and 5 qian per dan (numbers 16 to 20). As for numbers 21 to 25, the price is 18 taels and 5 qian per dan. It is said that the purchase of goods for the new year by inland firms from Hankou and other places has reached as much as 800 to 900 dan, resulting in even thinner inventories and a continued upward trend in prices.</p>
<h3>Coal: White Coal Sales are Quite Active</h3>
<p>Recently, there have been several groups of out-of-town firms coming to Shanghai to purchase coal for the New Year, so the market has been unusually lively in recent days. All goods have seen movement, especially various types of white coal lumps and white coal fines, which have been selling best and at slightly higher prices. Yesterday, the market opened with 470 tons of Liujiang white coal lumps, priced at 16 taels and 7.5 qian, and 84 tons of fines, priced at 7 taels. 360 tons of Shanxi lumps were priced at 20 taels and 7.5 qian, 437 tons of Hongqi lumps were priced at 22 taels, and 250 tons of fines were priced at 11 taels and 2.5 qian. 116 tons of Great Wall lumps were priced at 17 taels, 80 tons of Jiaozhou lumps were priced at 14 taels, and 145 tons of Fuzhou fines were priced at 10 taels.</p>

<h3>Zhang Ji and He Yingqin Went to Ningbo Yesterday to Meet Zhuang and Chiang</h3>
<p>▲ Important Meeting at Sun's Residence Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>▲ Yu Youren Scheduled to Go to Hong Kong Tomorrow</p>
<p>▲ Sun Ke Talks About Trying to Meet Wang</p>
<p>Sun Ke, the President of the Executive Yuan, originally planned to take a boat to Ningbo yesterday at 5 p.m. with Wu Tiecheng, Kong Xiangxi, Yang Shuzhuang, and others. Because Mr. Sun received a telegram yesterday morning from Chiang Kai-shek's elder brother, Xi Hou, from Ningbo, stating that Chiang was now recuperating in Yandang Mountain in southern Zhejiang, and the telegram could not be delivered, it was decided after discussions to ask He Yingqin and Zhang Ji to go first. After meeting with Chiang, they would inquire about his intentions and activities, and then Sun and others would decide whether to go or not. Zhang and He arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and took the Xinning-Shaolun boat to Ningbo at 5 p.m. to transfer to Fenghua to meet Chiang. As for Yu Youren, the President of the Control Yuan, he also arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning and is scheduled to go to Hong Kong tomorrow to urge Hu Hanmin to come to Nanjing. The details of each situation are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Yu and Zhang Arrived in Shanghai Together</p>
<p>Yu Youren, the President of the Control Yuan, Zhang Ji, the President of the Legislative Yuan, Li Wenfan, the Minister of the Interior, and Li Zongren, a member of the Central Committee, arrived in Shanghai together by night train from Nanjing at 8 a.m. yesterday. After returning to their residences for a short rest, Yu and others visited Sun Ke at Molier Road one after another.</p>
<p>▲ Important Meeting at Sun's Residence Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, after Sun Ke received a telegram from Chiang Kai-shek's brother from Ningbo, Yu Youren and Zhang Ji visited one after another around 10 a.m. Sun immediately sent telegrams inviting Feng Yuxiang, He Yingqin, Wu Tiecheng, Zou Lu, and Huang Hanliang to his residence for discussions. Chen Youren also attended the meeting. The issue of going to Ningbo to welcome Chiang was discussed. As Chiang's whereabouts and residence are currently uncertain, it would be necessary to search for and visit him after going to Ningbo, which would inevitably delay the timeline. The central government cannot be without someone in charge for a day. Therefore, everyone agreed that Sun and others should stay in Shanghai for the time being and first ask Zhang Ji and He Yingqin to go to Ningbo to meet Chiang immediately. After determining his intentions, Sun and others would decide whether to go or not. Sun Ke and others expressed their agreement at the time, and the decision was made. They then discussed financial and diplomatic issues and dispersed around 12 noon. (Photo taken by this newspaper of Zhang Ji and He Yingqin leaving for Ningbo yesterday)</p>
<p>▲ Zhang and He Head to Ningbo</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2:30 p.m., Zhang Ji and He Yingqin went to Sun's residence in the same car to say goodbye, and then went straight to the Ning-Shao Wharf at the 16th Pier to board the Xinning-Shaolun boat to Ningbo. The boat set sail at 5:10 p.m. yesterday and will arrive in Ningbo at 6 a.m. this morning. Then, they will transfer to a car and drive straight to Fenghua, which will only take one and a half hours. Therefore, it is expected that Zhang and He will arrive in Fenghua around 8 a.m. this morning. However, Chiang's current residence is unknown to everyone. After Zhang and He arrive in Fenghua, they still need to inquire, so it is unknown whether they will be able to meet Chiang within a day or two. However, Zhang Ji and He Yingqin stated before their departure that this trip would take no more than three days, after which they would return to Shanghai and then go to Fenghua with Sun and others to meet Chiang.</p>
<p>▲ Remarks Made on the Boat by a Reporter from the East China News Agency</p>
<p>Yesterday, I met Zhang Ji and He Yingqin on the Xinning-Shaolun boat. According to the two, they still need to find Mr. Chiang on this trip to Ningbo. President Sun and others must take on important central positions, so they will not go to Ningbo for the time being. After they meet Mr. Chiang, they will come to Shanghai and travel together. This is the more appropriate approach, so President Sun, Minister Chen, and others are staying in Shanghai temporarily. As for Mayor Wu, he has just taken office and has a lot of official duties, so he did not travel with them. These are the reasons, and there are no other issues. We believe that after meeting Mr. Chiang, Mr. Chiang will be able to follow public opinion and resume presiding over the central government's major plans. Furthermore, when Mr. Chiang stepped down in the past, he repeatedly stated that he would take responsibility and advance and retreat responsibly. In this time of national crisis, Mr. Chiang cannot be indifferent. Therefore, we believe that it is possible for Mr. Chiang to resume his difficult task. Zhang Ji also made a statement about the North China Political Council, saying that the external rumors were inaccurate. The so-called North China Political Council is a misunderstanding of the North China Political Affairs Council. When Zhang Hanqing was Deputy Commander, he had an organization called the Northeast Political Affairs Council, which included Pingjin, Chahar, Suiyuan, Rehe, Heilongjiang, and the three provinces of Northeast China. Now that Zhang has lost the eastern provinces, the name of the Northeast Political Affairs Council is inappropriate. Therefore, he plans to reorganize the North China Political Affairs Council to reduce the scope. This matter is still in preparation and has not been formally established. I also heard about it when I was in Peiping. The proposal for the Taiyuan branch also arose from this. Currently, this matter is still being submitted to the central government for instructions. If the central government does not approve it, then the council will naturally be terminated. The external rumors of a political branch are all false rumors. As a member of the Central Committee, would I do such a ridiculous thing? He Yingqin also said that in this time of national crisis, the entire nation is united in resisting Japan, and the patriotic enthusiasm of the people is commendable. However, in my opinion, we should first unify domestic affairs and reorganize finances. Without internal unity, we cannot face the outside world. Without economic solutions, there is no way to equip transportation construction and all national defense equipment. Therefore, at this time, although diplomacy is important, domestic affairs are even more pressing than diplomacy.</p>
<p>▲ Sun Ke Stated Yesterday</p>
<p>President of the Executive Yuan, Sun Ke, told reporters yesterday that various issues were discussed briefly at the meeting at his residence today. If Mr. Hu, Mr. Wang, and Mr. Chiang do not come to Nanjing, then the government's various plans cannot be implemented. I have now decided to stay in Shanghai temporarily and plan to find a way to meet Mr. Wang to urge him to overcome his illness and come to Nanjing to preside over the major plans.</p>
<p>▲ Yu Scheduled to Go to Hong Kong Tomorrow</p>
<p>After Yu Youren, the President of the Control Yuan, arrived in Shanghai yesterday in response to the Central Committee's appointment, he purchased three tickets for the Great Lai Company's ship, the President Jefferson, and will leave Shanghai tomorrow (the 13th) morning with Central Committee member Wang Luyi, Secretary Liu Kaizhong, and attendants to urge Hu Zhantang to overcome his illness and come to Nanjing.</p>
<p>▲ Wang's Recent Condition</p>
<p>Yesterday, reporters went to Noel Hospital to inquire about the condition of Mr. Wang Jingwei. According to Dr. Noel, Mr. Wang's illness will take at least six weeks to recover. He exerted himself slightly the day before yesterday, and the illness worsened again. The doctor believed that Wang's condition made it impossible for him to see guests, so he declined all visitors on his behalf. If Mr. Wang can rest peacefully and avoid worrying thoughts, he can regain his original health in six weeks, and there is no danger.</p>
<h3>Opposition to Seizure of National Taxes</h3>
<p>▲ National Credit Heavily Shaken, Where Shall People's Livelihood Rely?</p>
<p>Various organizations in this city were extremely indignant yesterday upon reading reports that Zhang Xueliang and the provinces of Shanxi, Fujian, and Guangdong were seizing national taxes designated for the principal and interest fund of public debt treasury bills. They sent numerous letters and telegrams expressing their strong opposition. The original texts are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ Bondholders</p>
<p>▲ Telegram to the National Government: Republic of China Domestic Public Debt Treasury Bill Holders Association telegraphed Chairman Lin and President Sun yesterday, saying: "To Chairman Lin of the Nanjing National Government and President Sun of the Executive Yuan: Now that Ning and Yue are unified and a new government is established, the people's expectations are focused on reforming internal affairs, establishing financial stability, resisting Japan with force, and recovering lost territories. Unexpectedly, Zhang Xueliang not only disobeyed the central government's orders by leading his troops into the customs, resulting in the fall of three provinces into the hands of the violent Japanese, but also does not regret his mistakes. Rumors are spreading that he is seizing national taxes, and the governments of Guangdong, Fujian, and Shandong are doing the same, undermining unity and violating laws. National principles and discipline still exist, how can we sit idly by? Moreover, national taxes have already been designated as the principal and interest fund for bonds. Under the current internal and external troubles, we are already worried about patching up a dilapidated house, and this seizure will only exacerbate the situation, making it even more strained. National credit is difficult to maintain, and where shall the people's livelihood rely? If this is not strictly corrected, imitators will emerge one after another. If Zhang Xueliang and others can disregard national laws and seize national taxes, then those who hold the source of taxes can also use their means of retaining them. What kind of country and what kind of government will this become? We earnestly request a swift halt to protect national credit and maintain the people's livelihood. We urgently submit this telegram and humbly ask for your consideration. Respectfully, the Republic of China Domestic Public Debt Treasury Bill Holders Association."</p>
<p>▲ Telegram to the Ministry of Finance: The association also telegraphed Minister Huang yesterday, saying: "To Minister Huang of the Nanjing Ministry of Finance: Previously, at the beginning of your honorable tenure, we telegraphed requesting the prompt convening of a national financial conference to address the urgent situation and a national economic conference to address the root causes. The reason we propose these two conferences is because we believe that legally, the extension of the payment of principal and interest on bonds, which was withdrawn by the proposer, is no longer an issue. However, in reality, whether the national taxes designated as the principal and interest fund for bonds are sufficient for payment due to various reasons is still a significant issue. We hope that cost reduction will be decided at the financial conference and revenue generation will be determined at the economic conference. However, recent news has spread that Zhang Xueliang intends to seize national taxes, disregarding national credit and the people's livelihood, and the governments of Guangdong, Fujian, and Shandong are doing the same. We fear that there will be more to follow. If national laws are disregarded in this way, what kind of government will this become? And the extreme consequences are that if Zhang Xueliang and others can disregard national laws and indirectly seize national tax sources, then if there are those who directly seize tax sources, the government will have no way to hold them accountable. We specifically telegram to request that you promptly present this to the government, rectify discipline, and stop the illegal seizure of national taxes by Zhang Xueliang and others to protect national credit and maintain the people's livelihood. We are exceedingly hopeful. Respectfully, the Republic of China Domestic Public Debt Treasury Bill Holders Association with seal."</p>
<p>▲ Telegram to Various Bank Associations: "To the Tianjin Bankers Association, Beiping Bankers Association, Guangzhou Bankers Association, Hankou Bankers Association, Hangzhou Bankers Association: Since the Republic of China, the government has issued a large number of public debt treasury bills, especially in the past four or five years. The interests of bondholders are deeply affected. If there are problems with the bond fund, national credit and the people's livelihood will be greatly impacted. Considering this, our association was established on December 21st of last year. Although the proposal to delay the payment of principal and interest has been withdrawn, there are reports of Guangdong, Fujian, Shandong, and Hebei provinces seizing national taxes. If this becomes a reality, the fund for repaying bonds will be short. We specifically telegram to request your association to unite with local bondholders, form an association, and actively advocate together so that national finances can gradually get on track, and national credit and the people's livelihood can both be relied upon. This is our sincere hope, and we look forward to your guidance. Respectfully, the Republic of China Domestic Public Debt Treasury Bill Holders Association with seal."</p>
<p>▲ Telegram to the Beiping Financial Committee: "To the Beiping Bankers Association for transfer to the Beiping Financial Committee: We have heard that the authorities, due to unpaid military and administrative expenses, intend to seize national taxes designated as the principal and interest fund for bonds. This concerns national credit and the people's livelihood and must not be allowed to happen. Otherwise, if finances lose their proper course, bond credit will immediately be shaken. We specifically telegram to request strong opposition and hope for a reply. Bondholders Association, No. 4 Shanghai Hong Kong Road, with seal."</p>
<p>▲ Letter to Banking and Money Trade Associations: The association sent separate letters yesterday to the Shanghai Bankers Association, the Shanghai Money Trade Association, and the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange and Securities Commodities Exchange, saying: "To the addressees: We trust that you have received our previous letter. It has now been reported that Zhang Xueliang and Shandong, Fujian, and Guangdong are all planning to seize national taxes designated as the principal and interest fund for bonds. If this becomes a reality, national credit and the people's livelihood would be unthinkable. Accordingly, we are writing to request that your association (exchange) promptly notify those related to bonds to join our association to strengthen our power and protect our legal rights. We sincerely value your friendship."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Special District Citizens' Federation telegraphed Minister Huang yesterday, saying: "To Minister Huang of the Nanjing Ministry of Finance: We were shocked to read in the newspapers that Zhang Xueliang and the provinces of Shandong, Fujian, and Guangdong are planning to seize national taxes.

This concerns the foundation of the country, and we specifically telegram to request that you find a way to stop it forcefully. Otherwise, the people will be forced to seek other ways to protect their credit. We urgently intrude upon your attention and humbly ask for your consideration.

<h3>The China Merchants Bureau Stoppage Crisis Completely Resolved Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Double Salary Paid as Usual, Ships Resume Sailing</p>
<p>▲ Commissioner Guo Telegraphed Resignation to the Capital Yesterday</p>
<p>After the entire crew of the China Merchants Bureau went on strike due to the issue of double salaries, the crisis was completely resolved last night through the mediation of Du Yuesheng, Yu Qiaqing, and others. Commissioner Guo Waifeng telegraphed the National Government to resign, and the bureau affairs are temporarily handled by Secretary Bao Gongfan. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Resolution Terms: At 10 p.m. the night before last, mediators Du Yuesheng, Yu Qiaqing, Li Zhengwu, Yang Zhixiong, and others mediated at Du's residence. Due to time constraints, negotiations continued at 5 p.m. yesterday. As a result, the China Merchants Bureau and the crew representatives agreed on four terms: (1) Double salary will be paid as usual (half a month's extra salary for January, and another half a month for March) based on the December payroll; (2) All bureau staff and crew members will be treated equally; (3) Crew members shall not be dismissed without reason; (4) If the bureau staff and workers' union and the five dock workers' union are recognized by the bureau, then the crew members' union should also be recognized.</p>
<p>▲ Crew Notice: The China Merchants Bureau crew members' petition group held a meeting at 38 Edward Road at 6 p.m. last night and decided to respect the mediators' opinions and issue an emergency notice to all crew members, saying: "To the addressees: The matter of our petition for double salary is currently being mediated by mediators Li Zhengwu, Du Yuesheng, Yu Qiaqing, Yang Zhixiong, and others and has been successfully resolved. The agreed terms are: (see above). The above terms have been recognized by both mediators. We respect the mediators' opinions and, in addition to expressing our acceptance, specifically notify all captains to contact the bureau and await orders to set sail without delay. This is an urgent notice."</p>
<p>▲ Resumption of Sailing Today: The China Merchants Bureau ships on the Yangtze River and at sea that were suspended due to the crew's demand for double year-end salaries, such as Jianghua, Jiang'an, Jiangtian, Emei, Xinming, Tonghua, Haiyan, Guangji, Taishun, Guangli, Jiangjing, Gongping, Yushun, Tunan, Taishun, and others, will completely resume sailing starting today.</p>
<p>▲ Commissioner Resigns: Commissioner of the China Merchants Bureau, Guo Waifeng, telegraphed the Chairman of the National Government yesterday, requesting approval to resign, saying: "To Chairman Lin of the National Government: This bureau has been suffering from exhaustion for a long time. The commissioner was ordered to reorganize it. Since arriving at the bureau, eight months have passed in an instant. The affairs are complex and difficult to sort out, and the finances are stretched and difficult to plan. During the military period, the ships were requisitioned for military use, and business was suspended, with a greater impact. The accumulated debts of past office holders are also considerable, and demands for payment are constantly coming, making it difficult to cope. Fortunately, the domestic military situation has ended, and the people are fiercely boycotting Japanese shipping, so we are planning to develop further, add ships, and open up routes. Unexpectedly, the crew suddenly requested to be paid a year-end double salary. Considering the situation of the bureau, the commissioner is trying to economize on all expenses, and this matter is not only unprecedented in the bureau but also rare in the industry, so it should be carefully considered and not easily allowed. However, the crew did not understand this and went on strike. The details have been telegraphed on a previous day. Over the past two days, I have tried to persuade them several times, but the commissioner's sincerity has not been trusted and has not been resolved. At this time of national crisis, all are united, and we are still worried about not being able to overcome the difficulties, but this has happened. I am deeply saddened and even more fearful. I am afraid that I will delay the bureau's affairs, so I dare to resign and respectfully request approval to vacate the post and appoint other capable people to take over, to meet the expectations of the public and avoid prolonged disruptions to transportation, benefiting both public and private interests. I am deeply grateful and respectfully submit this telegram, hoping for your approval and filled with apprehension. Respectfully, Commissioner Guo Waifeng, organizing the China Merchants Bureau."</p>
<h3>He Zhuguo Willing to Stay at Famous Pass to the End</h3>
<p>▲ Reply to Zhejiang National Crisis Association's Telegram</p>
<p>He Zhuguo, Brigade Commander of Shanhaiguan, replied to the Zhejiang National Crisis Relief Association, saying: "To the Zhejiang Provincial National Crisis Relief Association: I received your kind telegram. I am honored by your encouragement and filled with shame and trepidation. With responsibility on my shoulders, how can I allow distractions? Zhuguo is determined to stay at the famous pass to the end. Success or failure, gain or loss, are not my concerns. I only hope that my compatriots will rise up and urge the central government to extend this last shred of national strength and protect this last stronghold. I am holding back and enduring the pain, waiting for your hope. He Zhuguo with seal."</p>
<h3>Feng Yuxiang's Conversation</h3>
<p>▲ Denies News of Imminent Return North</p>
<p>Feng Yuxiang released the following statement yesterday: (Question) It has recently been heard that the National Defense Council will be established soon amid the current national defense crisis, and the central government has decided to invite you to serve as the chairman. Can you tell us the details? (Answer) I have not heard of it. (Question) Will you be going to Fenghua and Hong Kong recently? (Answer) If Mr. Hu and Mr. Chiang do not come north, then I will definitely go to Hong Kong and Ningbo, but the date has not yet been determined. (Question) What did you discuss at Mr. Sun's residence today (yesterday)? Did you discuss the matter of Mr. Sun and others going to Fenghua to urge Mr. Chiang to go to the capital? (Answer) Today (yesterday), I met with Mr. Sun and only discussed the difficult financial situation, not other matters. (Question) Is it true that you have plans to go north soon? (Answer) Not true. Finally, there is one more point: yesterday's newspaper reported that I sent a telegram to Mr. Lin Zichao, saying that I am recuperating in Shanghai and cannot go to the capital, etc. This is not true, and I did not send this telegram. I am afraid there is a misunderstanding, so I am making this additional statement."</p>
<h3>Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Director Mai Chaochu Took Office Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Oath Ceremony to Be Held on Another Day</p>
<p>Mr. Mai Chaochu, the new director of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, took office at the bureau yesterday and will hold an official oath ceremony on another day. He completed the handover in the morning and addressed all the staff in the afternoon with sincere encouragement. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ Handover Situation: At around 10 a.m. yesterday, Mr. Mai Chaochu, accompanied by Secretary Huang Shenzhi, Section Chief Mai Gongyun, and more than ten others, arrived at the bureau by car. He immediately sent Dong to take over the documents from the Registry. Mr. Mai took over the seals, funds, account books, and other items and issued two written orders, saying: [No public property within the bureau shall be moved out without authorization, this order.] [No staff member of this bureau shall leave his post without authorization, this order, Director Mai, etc.] Those who came to offer congratulations from all sides included Secretary-General Yu Hongjun of the Municipal Government, President Xu Fu of the Municipal Bank, and representatives from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, various industry unions, and various trade associations. Mr. Mai greeted them one by one.</p>
<p>▲ Staff Changes: The previous Secretary of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, Mi Xingru, Section Chief of the First Section, Sun Jianhou, Section Chief of the Second Section, Wu Huanru, Section Chief of the Third Section, Zhang Tinghao, and Section Chief of the Fourth Section, Feng Liutang, have all submitted their resignations. Yesterday, when Director Mai took over, except for Sun Jianhou, Section Chief of the First Section, who came to the bureau to handle the handover, the rest did not come to the bureau. Mr. Mai has appointed Mai Gongyun as the Section Chief of the First Section and Huang Shenzhi as the Secretary. For Wu Huanru, the Section Chief of the Second Section, Mr. Mai entrusted Huang Jitong, a member of the bureau's Grain Committee, to go to Wu's residence to personally persuade him to stay, and Wu has agreed, so he will continue to serve.</p>
<p>▲ Director's Address: At 3 p.m. yesterday, Director Mai convened all the staff and addressed them in the auditorium, saying: "I was ordered to be the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau this time, and it was done hastily. It is difficult to decide and announce specific new plans for the bureau's future at this time. However, I have always been practical in my work and do not advocate empty talk. The position of this bureau can be said to occupy an important position in this city. Matters such as agricultural, industrial, and commercial organizations, labor disputes, and poverty relief are all handled by this bureau. I believe that various disputes in society are mostly caused by inequality and dissatisfaction in economic life. This bureau has always handled labor disputes, and there are a great many of them. This is an example. I believe that these disputes should be dealt with fairly. As for poverty relief, there are beggars everywhere. This is an example of the prevalence of the poor. This is not only an eyesore but also enough to indicate the economic distress of society and the state of being on the verge of bankruptcy. Therefore, I believe that even if we do not talk about ambitious plans, even the problem of beggars must be solved quickly. All plans will be made after examining the situation of the bureau and the objective conditions of all aspects. However, I believe that the Social Affairs Bureau is a mechanism related to all sectors of society. The progress of the bureau's affairs and the development of social undertakings all depend on everyone's joint efforts. If everyone thinks that this bureau is a bureaucratic organization, then that is wrong. The personnel within the bureau are mostly people who have been working for many years and are rich in knowledge and experience. I will not easily change them," and so on.</p>
<p>▲ Staff's Response: After the Director's speech, Section Member Tian Heqing delivered a welcome speech on behalf of all the staff. "Today is the day that Director Mai takes office, and we are deeply gratified to have a new leader. Tracing back to when this bureau was the Bureau of Agriculture, Industry, and Commerce, former Director Pan was the first person to hold the post. Since the reorganization of the Social Affairs Bureau in August of the 17th year of the Republic, thanks to the hard work of former Director Pan, the construction projects have been able to proceed in an orderly manner to this day. The statistical work especially has a considerable position, and the daily mediation of labor disputes, the organization of agricultural, industrial, commercial, and charitable organizations also have a beginning. Social order is gradually stabilizing, and the estrangement between labor and capital is gradually disappearing. Recently, the implementation of the Factory Law, the promotion of weights and measures, the construction of the National Goods Exhibition Hall, and the overall planning of the people's livelihood issues are still in active progress. We have fulfilled our duty as civil servants and followed former Director Pan to achieve this result, and we are also proud of it. Now, former Director Pan has been working hard for four years and eagerly wants to retire, and his resignation has been approved. The Central Government has specially appointed Director Mai to lead this bureau. Director Mai is a revolutionary pioneer, and his achievements for the Party and the country in the past are well known, and his selflessness and fearless revolutionary spirit are especially admired by us. Recently, we listened to his speech, and he sincerely encouraged us with the word 'sincerity', so he will surely treat us with sincerity, and we will naturally follow Director Mai with sincerity and work hard for the Party, the country, and society. Hereby, I represent all the staff and extend a welcome."</p>

In addition to submitting a report and distributing it, I hereby issue this announcement for general knowledge. January 11, the 21st year of the Republic of China, Director Mai Chaochu."</p>
<p>▲ Mai's Brief Biography: Mai Chaochu, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, whose courtesy name is Zhongjie, is from Taishan, Guangdong. He is 35 years old this year. In the 7th year of the Republic of China, he graduated from the Department of Arts of Peking University.

The name is clear, but time and time again it goes wrong! Zhang Xueliang is muddled, failed to protect and lost Liaoning, insulting the land and people, creating crime that won't be forgotten, now there is no debate. Only you are believers of the leader of the party, more so than the others, and were revolutionary members, the low pillars of China. As we are invaded, unite and bear the burden, unify internal affairs, to defend together and build a complete country. The people are waiting with concern for the central committee to come, but after unification Jinzhou was lost! The conference of 9 provinces, and the defense league were a failure. If the central committee breaks and there is separation, the country will fail through the hands of those leading the Party. For the good of the people, please hurry to the central committee to defend China. In the event that this central committee falls, our unions will come together to form a voluntary army to defend our nation. Please take this matter to heart. Shanghai Water and Wood Industry Volunteer Army Committee Members Zhang Shifa, Sun Yuxuan, Shao Shunqing, Zhang Qiuquan, Li Ruiqing, etc. with seal."</p>
<h3>National Postal Workers' Congress Opens Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲Representatives from Fifteen Provinces Arrive, with Representatives from Six Provinces Still En Route</p>
<p>▲Preparatory Meeting Scheduled for This Morning, General Assembly to Follow This Afternoon</p>
<p>The National Postal Workers' Congress, initiated and convened by the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union, opened as scheduled yesterday at 10:00 AM at No. 9 Runde Lane, Fusheng Road, Zhabei. The ceremony was solemn. A presidium was elected on the spot, and a secretariat and a credentials committee were formed. After the ceremony, the credentials committee convened in the afternoon to review proposals. A preparatory meeting is scheduled for this morning, followed by the general assembly this afternoon. As of yesterday, representatives from fifteen provinces had arrived in Shanghai. The atmosphere was very dignified. The details are reported below:</p>
<p>▲Arriving Representatives Yesterday, the following representatives arrived in Shanghai successively: Kang Yong from Liaoning, Pin Zhengxuan from Hebei, Liang Shaodong from Henan, Quan Yunjie from Hubei, Zheng Yipeng from Jiangxi, Hu Mengquan from Shanxi, Huang Jinhai from Guangdong, Hu Xie from Hunan, Wang Yinglin from Jiangsu and Anhui, Jiang Jiade, Yang Bozhao, Qi Qie, Wang Shiying from Zhejiang, Kang Yong from Jilin (also representing Heilongjiang), Fu Dewei, Huang Jieming, Zhang Xiyang, Shi Yitang, and Huang Gongfu from Shanghai, totaling fifteen postal districts. Representatives from six provinces and regions—Guangxi, Xinjiang, Yunnan, Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu—have all telegraphed that they are en route and will arrive within days.</p>
<p>▲Opening Ceremony At 10:00 AM, all representatives gathered at the meeting place. Led by Fu Dewei, the ceremony proceeded as follows (Order of Ceremony for the First National Postal Workers' Congress): 1. All stand at attention and give the highest salute to the Party, the national flag, and the portrait of the late Premier. 2. Reverently read the Premier's will. 3. Observe three minutes of silence to mourn national difficulties. 4. The chairman delivers the opening address. 5. The preparatory committee of the National Postal Workers' General Union reports on the preparatory process. 6. Representatives from each district report on the work situation in their respective districts and the state of the labor movement in various regions. 7. Speeches. 8. Photograph. 9. End of ceremony.</p>
<p>▲Welcoming Representatives After the ceremony, Chairman Fu Dewei delivered a welcoming speech, saying: "World affairs change, trends surge. To undertake the work of ten thousand people is to establish a foundation for a hundred generations. Thus, we drive ourselves forward to create a bright future for the postal industry and strive for the welfare of workers. However, scope limited to one corner breeds narrow-mindedness, and those who are rigid hold only fragmented views. Application values adaptability, and those who speak trivially cannot escape petty criticism. Moreover, to act only when the time is right is to fear the folly of marking a boat to find a lost sword; one wave, one ripple, and the danger of bankruptcy looms. This is like hiding a sword in the city, where the light of the Dipper is close; or throwing jade into the water, where the colors of the rainbow have yet to fly. Though we have endured much hardship, we have not yet reached the highest level. It is fitting that we be like a bell waiting to be struck, or jade waiting to be polished. Then, offering robes and pushing up sleeves, we should humbly attach ourselves to the swift steed; gathering thoughts and broadening our minds, we shall step forward to mount the dragon. Visit my southern village, and come swiftly a thousand miles like Ji Kang. Act as my host in the east, and await Fan Shi's return for three years. The joy of unity surpasses that of flesh and blood, and the benefits of hardship equal those of siblings. May I dare to say that, standing near the water tower, we participate in the administration of the government, and with boundless aspirations, we contemplate the distant clouds and trees. This is precisely the reason why our association welcomes the representatives of the National Postal Workers' General Union with utmost sincerity. Let us not betray our long-held aspirations, and let us meet in this grand gathering. Regardless of whether you come from the south or the north, let us personally experience your great talents. May we together defend our territory and listen eagerly to your teachings. Being inquisitive leads to abundance, and specialized skills alone are insufficient. Taking goodness as our teacher, a broad scope is uniquely superior. From now on, let us rectify association affairs and encourage each other with economic writing; let us recover postal rights and teach me your profound plans. United in confronting external forces, let us uproot the unrighteous and overthrow the powerful. With many paths converging, let us pledge our loyalty and unveil the darkness. Ultimately, let us harmonize words and deeds and broadly implement teachings, rather than drifting like the wind and rain, enduring the perils of rugged paths. Let us emulate Guan Zhong and Bao Shuya in their cooperation and establish an extraordinary undertaking today. Let us meet like needle and mustard seed and pass on our reputation to future generations. Distinguishing between right and wrong will prevent deviant paths, and respecting authority will guard against frivolous conduct. With so many heroes present, who would cling to petty grievances and forget their comrades? At such a young age, everyone must set aside personal grudges and strive to be prepared for battle. With shared skills, good fortune will present harmony. May we, like ordinary silk and constant fabrics, receive the needle that mends the robes of emperors. If we can advance side by side, we can lend our strength to support the wheels of progress. We shall see the forging of a multitude of talents, and the refined craftsmanship will transform the old. It is rare to have like-minded comrades visit; I respectfully bow my hands and offer my congratulations for the new year." Then, representatives delivered responses and reported on the association affairs and labor movement situation in various regions. The ceremony then ended.</p>
<p>▲Review of Proposals The presidium was then formed, with Fu Dewei and two others (names temporarily omitted) as members. A secretariat and a credentials committee were also established. The secretariat consisted of six members, and the credentials committee was divided into four groups, each with six members (names temporarily omitted). The credentials committee immediately began reviewing proposals in the afternoon, preparing them for the preparatory meeting to be held this morning. After detailed sorting, the proposals will be submitted to the general assembly for discussion. The conference is still scheduled for five days, with the official general assembly starting this afternoon and continuing until the 15th. However, due to the large number of proposals from various districts, which may require lengthy discussions, the conference will be extended by one day to the 16th.</p>
<p>▲Collection of Congratulatory Telegrams 1. The Preparatory Committee of the All-China Postal Workers' General Union and the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union sent a telegram to the National Postal Workers' Congress yesterday, stating: "To the National Postal Workers' Congress: Congratulations on the opening of the congress, the creation of a new framework, the strict organization, and the collective wisdom of all. Our unions share the same origin and have long endured hardships together. We sincerely hope to eliminate regional barriers, forge close ties of solidarity, and lay a solid foundation for our postal service with one heart and one mind. We send this telegram to express our congratulations and wish you a boundless future. Sincerely, The Preparatory Committee of the All-China Postal Workers' General Union." 2. "To the National Postal Workers' Congress: The development of our postal service relies on organization. The great achievements of the General Union were created two years ago. Today's congress further consolidates this foundation. With one heart and one mind, we forge ahead together. We send this telegram to express our congratulations and wish you continuous progress. Sincerely, The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union."</p>
<h3>Public Concession Studies Ways to Make Up for Budget Shortfall</h3>
<p>▲Increase in Police Rates Considered</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession is considering increasing the police rates by 2% from 14% to 16% in order to offset a budget shortfall for next year, despite making painful cuts in expenditures. This increase is estimated to generate an additional revenue of 1.2 million taels. After the council's Finance Committee carefully studied the issue based on a report from the accounting department, the proposal was thoroughly discussed at the last board meeting. Due to the significant implications, a decision was not immediately made and will be further considered after receiving detailed opinions from the Chinese councilors.</p>
<p>According to a statement released yesterday by the council's Information Office, the council's board is carefully studying the financial situation. In September of last year, the accounting department predicted a deficit of 600,000 taels at the end of the current fiscal year. However, by cutting expenditures in various departments and with improvements in exchange rates, the accounting director reported at a recent meeting of the Finance Committee that the projected deficit for this year has been reduced to less than 200,000 taels. However, the 1932 budget must not only cover this deficit but also raise an additional 2.3 million taels compared to this year. This is because in 1930, 2.3 million taels were carried over from previous years, which will not be available for the 1932 budget. Additionally, in 1931, 500,000 taels from accumulated rice reserves could be allocated, while it is estimated that regular income for 1932 will increase by 400,000 taels. The budget for each department for 1932 has just been completed, and it is difficult to predict the extent to which further cuts can be made. As it stands, the Public Works Department's budget is similar to that of 1931, but 200,000 taels with investment characteristics have been moved to the special expenditure category. The budget for the Health Department is approximately 150,000 taels higher than in 1931. Regarding education, there is a proposal to exclude education from the scope of budget cuts, which I support. It is not appropriate to impose undue restrictions during this initial phase of development. I plan to prepare a separate budget that lists the expenses for the educational plan that has already been approved in principle, the expenses for 1932 if it proceeds as planned, and the expenses for the following years to facilitate comprehensive planning. Based on current estimates, 1.5 million taels will be used for education in 1932, which is approximately equal to the revenue from the 2% increase in police rates. Regarding the issue of balancing the 1932 budget, the accounting director stated that even if each department makes cuts to the greatest extent possible, it would be difficult to balance revenue and expenditure if the police rates remain at 1.4%. The council should have requested taxpayers to increase taxes at the last annual meeting of taxpayers, but due to the aforementioned substantial funds carried over from 1930, a tax increase was not proposed. Fluctuations in the exchange rate of the council's pound payments are an important factor in balancing the budget. If the exchange rate for 1932 can reach two shillings, it would save approximately 1.1 million taels compared to the 1931 budget. However, the exchange rate for the next twelve months is difficult to predict, so it is necessary to be somewhat cautious in estimating the exchange rate for certain items. However, even if the council can manage to obtain a favorable exchange rate, it will be difficult to balance the budget without increasing police rates under the current circumstances. The accounting director also stated that in 1927, police rates were increased to 16% due to a budget shortfall, but current expenditures in various departments have increased compared to before. For example, the expenditure index for the Police Department is 113% compared to 1927, and for the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, it is 173%. However, due to the expected increase in exchange rates and the increase in tax revenue from re-evaluating land prices, it is hoped that an increase in police rates to 16% may balance revenue and expenditure, and that the tax rate of 16% is still very low compared to other Western cities. Furthermore, since the Finance Committee meeting in September of last year, the council has ordered the heads of each department to make every effort to cut expenditures during the remaining months of this year, especially when preparing the 1932 budget. The heads of each department have been able to make cuts to the greatest extent possible within their authority, which is deeply satisfying. After discussing the accounting director's proposal, the Finance Committee agreed to the tax increase. However, the financial situation must be reconsidered when determining the 1932 budget. When this proposal was moved to the board meeting for discussion, the accounting director stated that even with the 2% tax increase, the additional revenue of 1.2 million taels is not enough, and further cuts must be made to the expenditures of each department and certain items between the regular and special budgets must be reorganized in order to make up for the shortfall. A director then suggested that the taxpayers' ability to pay should also be considered. The directors then turned to discuss the financial situation of various industries. The accounting director stated that it would not be possible to reduce the budget deficit by as much as 2 million taels while maintaining essential government functions. A director then stated that with Shanghai's prosperity, a police rate of 16% is not inappropriate. Therefore, he advocated that the budget should be prepared based on a 16% tax rate, while providing the citizens with a detailed explanation of the reasons for the tax increase. Finally, it was decided to postpone the decision on this proposal to the next meeting. In the meantime, the Chinese directors will be asked to provide detailed opinions.</p>

<h3>Upper Yangtze River Shipping Disasters Caused by Shallow Water</h3>
<p>▲Piton Near Kongling Shoal Sinks</p>
<p>▲Yibin Loses Control at Chenglingji</p>
<p>Several ships on the Yangtze River have recently had accidents due to shallow water. A summary follows:</p>
<p>▲British Ship The Piton, an Upper Yangtze River merchant ship managed by Butterfield &amp; Swire, loaded a large quantity of cotton yarn, 950 pieces, in Shanghai and set sail for Chongqing. While traveling through the Kongling Shoal section of the river, the water level dropped, and the ship mistakenly ran aground on a reef. The bottom of the ship became lodged on the reef. The shipowner attempted to free the ship from the shoal. At that time, the ship was reversed, and the bottom of the ship was split in two by the reef. River water rushed into the cabin, and the ship immediately sank. The cargo in the cabin sank with the ship. Passengers on board struggled to escape. Fortunately, civilian ships were traveling near Taohe. After the shipowner sent out a distress call, many came to help with the rescue. However, it is not yet clear if there were any deaths or injuries. The broken ship has already sunk into the river. According to yesterday's telegram, the ship is likely to sink and there is no hope of towing it. The losses of the cargo and the ship alone amounted to 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. The damage to passengers and crew is not included.</p>
<p>▲American Ship in Distress The Yibin, a Shanghai-Chongqing liner of the American Merchant Yangtze River Company, transported goods from Shanghai to Chongqing last week. When it arrived at a place 15 miles downstream of Chenglingji, named Taolingji on the river, it encountered low water on the Upper Yangtze River, and the ship became stranded on the sandbar. After the ship was in distress, the shipowner sent out a radio distress call and raised a distress flag. When the Shashi, an Yichang liner of the Taikoo Company, passed upstream, it saw that the Yibin was in distress and went to help. First, a small boat was lowered into the river and approached the Yibin to rescue the passengers in batches and transport them to Yichang to land. At the same time, the Yichang branch of the Merchant Yangtze River Company dispatched its Chunhao merchant ship to Taolingji to transfer the cargo on the Yibin. Unexpectedly, after the ship was stranded, it was hit by a strong wind, and the ship leaned to one side, posing a very dangerous situation. After receiving the news, the insurance company here dispatched personnel to investigate. According to a telegram received by the Shanghai office yesterday, there were still 85 pieces of cotton yarn on board that had not been unloaded, and there was a risk of bandits attacking and looting. The U.S. military ship stationed in Hankou has been requested to sail to protect it. The current survey shows that there is still hope of salvaging the ship, but the construction is quite large and will cost at least 30,000 taels of silver. The passengers have safely gone to Yichang, and there were no casualties.</p>

<h3>Japanese Yarn Falsely Marked with Chinese Merchant Labels</h3>
<p>▲A Cunning Plan to Change Appearances</p>
<p>▲Rong Zongjing Sends People to Investigate and Seize the Goods</p>
<p>Since the Mukden Incident, and the exposure of Japan's plot to invade the Eastern Provinces, the Chinese people have been motivated by righteous indignation to engage in an economic boycott of Japan. Everyone has been calling for action, and the whole country is united. As a result, Japanese trade in China has suffered a major blow, especially the yarn industry. Unexpectedly, recently in Shanghai, there have been shameless merchants who privately purchased Japanese yarn, changed its appearance, and falsely used the trademarks of famous Chinese yarn factories, passing off the bad for the good in order to make a large profit. Yesterday at midnight, employees of the Shen Xin Yarn Factory received a tip and seized 15 large packages of Japanese yarn in Pudong that were falsely marked with the factory's "Man Bell" trademark. The details of the incident are as follows:</p>
<p>▲Rong's Yarn Business: Mr. Rong Zongjing, a wealthy merchant from Wuxi, is a giant in the Chinese flour industry and also holds the reins of the yarn and cotton industry. The most famous Shen Xin Yarn Factory in Shanghai was founded by Mr. Rong. There are a total of nine Shen Xin factories established one after another. Except for the third factory located in Wuxi and the fourth factory located in Hankou, the remaining seven factories (numbers 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9) are all located in the Pudong area of Shanghai. Their scale is enormous, unmatched by other factories. Their products are of excellent quality and their reputation is well-established.</p>
<p>Photograph of the seized counterfeit cotton yarn</p>
<p>▲Dishonest Merchants Counterfeit Brands: Since the September 18th Incident and the subsequent economic boycott of Japan, Japanese yarn prices have plummeted. Mr. Rong took advantage of this opportunity to increase production day and night to meet the urgent demand. Unexpectedly, two weeks ago, Mr. Rong received a report that unscrupulous merchants were secretly replacing the trademarks on Japanese yarn with those of Chinese yarn factories, changing its appearance and falsely using the Shen Xin "20-count Yellow Man Bell" and "42-count Blue Man Bell" brands, selling them on the market. He was asked to immediately conduct a thorough investigation to deter such wrongdoing.</p>
<p>▲Dispatching Men to Track Down the Source: Upon hearing the report, Mr. Rong paid special attention and immediately secretly instructed Hu Qingsheng, the director of general affairs of the Fifth Factory, and Qi Haitian, the chief inspector, to be responsible for the investigation. Hu and Qi immediately dispatched several staff members to investigate in various places, but with little success. It wasn't until the morning of the 9th that a secret informant came forward, saying that he had recently seen trucks from the Japanese shipping company Rikuun Kaisha near Kunming Road. There were traces of yarn on the trucks, which looked suspicious. Hu and Qi immediately drove to the location. When they arrived at the middle section of Kunming Road, they saw trucks from Rikuun Kaisha (numbers 1428 and 16513) and a truck from the Shanghai Moving Company (number 9720 in the Concession) parked there. The trucks were loaded with Japanese yarn, and several workers were moving the yarn into a new-style bungalow at number 184.</p>
<p>▲Waiting Patiently to Seize the Opportunity: Hu and Qi became suspicious of the situation. Since the bungalow at number 184 was neither a warehouse nor a weaving factory, there was no doubt that there was some secret activity going on. Hu and Qi secretly discussed how to proceed. Hu returned to the factory to report, while Qi remained on Kunming Road to secretly monitor the situation. They waited patiently for two days and two nights. Finally, at 7:05 AM yesterday morning, they saw two trucks, fully loaded with cotton yarn, drive out. Hu and Qi remained calm and followed behind in a car. They followed the trucks all the way to the intersection of Tiantong Road and Disiwei Road in Zhabei, which is under the jurisdiction of the Fifth District, Third Precinct of the Public Security Bureau.</p>
<p>▲Calling the Police to Solve the Case: At that time, someone on the truck at the rear noticed the car that Hu and Qi were in and was about to try to escape. Hu and Qi got out of their car and signaled to the police to stop the two trucks. Upon closer inspection of the yarn, it was clearly Japanese "20-count Hoynen" brand yarn that had been relabeled as Shen Xin "Yellow Man Bell" and Japanese "42-count Blue Phoenix" brand yarn that had been falsely marked as Shen Xin "42-count Blue Man Bell." They were taken to the Fifth District, Third Precinct. After questioning by Chief Zhang, the driver of the truck, Wang Guixun, from Ningbo, confessed that the Japanese yarn was loaded from the Toyota Yarn Factory, transported to number 184 Kunming Road, and relabeled. Today, under the orders of a Japanese man named Mori, he was transporting the counterfeit yarn to the Japanese disinfection facility on Disiwei Road for packaging, and then transporting it to other ports for sale. As for Shanghai, the Huachang Dyeing and Weaving Factory on Fulili Road in the French Concession was acting as a consignment agent.</p>
<p>▲Japanese People Dejected and Leave: While Chief Zhang was conducting the preliminary hearing, Japanese people including Yamaji, Kimura, and Mita led a large group of Japanese ruffians to the police station, shouting loudly and behaving aggressively. Seeing the situation was not good, Chief Zhang feared that an accident would occur. He tried to appease the Japanese with words while urgently telegraphing the headquarters for instructions. When Director Wen heard the news, he immediately dispatched Director Hong of the Foreign Affairs Section of the Second Division to negotiate. When Hong arrived at the Fifth District, the Japanese ruffians were still gathered at the gate of the police station. After Hong sternly rebuked them, the Japanese were at a loss for words and had no room for argument. They left dejectedly. Director Hong also hurried back to report to Director Wen.</p>
<p>▲Transfer to the Court: After hearing Director Hong's report, Director Wen decided that since both parties resided in the International Settlement, the case should be transferred to the court for legal proceedings. He ordered Chief Zhang to first count the total number of packages on the two trucks, which was 64 large bales. He then notified the Harbin Police Station to send the original goods and the driver to the First Special District Court to be handled by Judge Zhou. Judge Zhou deemed it necessary to investigate the case and immediately sent both parties to the Yangshupu Police Station for investigation. The driver, Wang Guixun, was temporarily detained for questioning. The Shen Xin employees, Hu and Qi, were ordered to temporarily return to the factory and await the trial.</p>
<h3>Hu Yongchang Company Secretly Imports Large Quantities of Japanese Coal</h3>
<p>▲The Trade Association Voluntarily Reports the Offense</p>
<p>▲The Municipal Anti-Japanese Association Investigates, Determines the Facts, and Confiscates the Goods</p>
<p>According to the China News Agency, the Shanghai Coal Trade Association formed a Japanese goods inspection team after Japan invaded and occupied the Northeast. They have been working hard on inspection work. Recently, with the fall of Jinzhou and the increasingly precarious national situation, the association's work has become even more intense. At 9:00 AM yesterday (the 11th), inspectors from the association discovered a Japanese Mitsui coal ship near Hengfeng Bridge on the Suzhou Creek. After investigation, it was confirmed that it was purchased from the Japanese Mitsui Yoko by the Hu Yongchang Coal Company of Chihang Bridge, Xinza Road, with more than 200 tons of coal on board. The ship had just sailed from the new Mitsui Yoko warehouse in Pudong and had already unloaded 30 tons. The owner of the company, Hu Jifu, recklessly undermined the anti-Japanese goods movement and, under the pretext of the Concession's power, requested the Xinza Road Police Station to send officers to escort the Japanese coal ashore. The inspectors from the Coal Trade Association reported this to the inspection department of the Municipal Anti-Japanese Association, which dispatched personnel to intervene, detain the ship, and transport the remaining ten tons of Japanese coal to the Yitaixing West Warehouse on Guangfu Road in Zhabei. According to coal industry insiders, Hu Jifu, the owner of the Hu Yongchang Coal Company, usually sang high praises for patriotism and boycotting Japanese goods in the association, but secretly engaged in this despicable behavior. A request will be submitted to the Municipal Anti-Japanese Association for severe punishment to serve as a warning to those who undermine the patriotic movement.</p>
<h3>American Woman Crowley Imprisoned for Smuggling Opium</h3>
<p>▲First Opium Case Handled by the U.S. Court for China</p>
<p>According to the Great American Evening Post, American woman Crowley, who is known for importing ice cream to China for sale, was arrested at her residence in the French Concession at 8:30 PM on Saturday night by the U.S. Deputy Marshal, two assistants, and French Concession police officers. Because the case is serious, bail was set at US$10,000. The bail has not yet been paid, so she remains in custody. Crowley is charged with smuggling opium. The indictment was filed by U.S. Attorney Selette, who claims that Crowley, between August 11 and September 13 of last year, smuggled 55 tins of opium, each tin containing three to four ounces of opium, from Shanghai to an unspecified port in the Pacific Ocean aboard the U.S. Navy destroyer USS Chaumont. The case was discovered through the collaborative investigation efforts of U.S. authorities in Shanghai and the U.S. Department of Justice and Treasury personnel stationed on the Pacific coast. This is the first time in the history of the U.S. Court for China that an American has been charged with smuggling opium. U.S. Judge Pandy has subpoenaed witnesses from Germany, and the trial will begin as soon as they arrive in Shanghai. The details of the smuggling are still unknown. However, it is reported that there was an accomplice on board the USS Chaumont. It is worth noting that Crowley was charged with running a brothel in Harbin in 1923 and was fined US$500 by the U.S. Judge. In 1930, she was fined US$50 for assault.</p>
<h3>Merchants and Residents of Nanshi Petition for Tax Reduction</h3>
<p>▲Notification Slips Affixed with Tax Stamps</p>
<p>▲Heavy Burden and Trouble</p>
<p>More than one hundred merchants and residents in the area of Nanshi's Nine Mu Land recently contacted the Shanghai Precious Tax Bureau, arguing that the requirement for all shops to affix tax stamps to notification slips was an excessive burden and troublesome procedure. They pointed out that even a minor oversight in affixing the stamps would result in severe penalties, causing them considerable distress. Yesterday, they organized a group of more than one hundred merchants and residents and sent two representatives, Chen Huikang and Zhang Shengkang, to the Bureau at Xiaoximen to request an exemption. The Director of the Shanghai Precious Tax Bureau, Song Ziju, was not present at the time, so the representatives were received by a staff member named Yi Mingshang. The representatives stated their purpose and requested an exemption from the tax stamp requirement for notification slips to ease the burden on merchants and residents. However, Yi stated that the requirement to affix tax stamps to notification slips was stipulated by the national government's stamp tax law. He said that he had no authority to grant an exemption and that it would affect central regulations. He indicated that he could not be responsible for the merchants and residents' request. Negotiations continued for a long time, and by 1:00 PM, there was still no resolution. The merchants and residents then returned in an orderly manner.</p>
<h3>Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Opposes the Municipal Council's High Assessment of Rent</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce issued a declaration regarding the Public Concession Municipal Council's high assessment of rent and collection of general taxes: The Shanghai Municipal Council's method of collecting general taxes, except for self-occupied properties that require rent assessment, follows financial principles and uses the actual rent as the calculation standard. Recently, it has come up with an unconventional idea to inflate rents as a step towards increasing taxes. For example, actual rents of 84 taels per month are being assessed at 190 taels. In essence, this is no different from increasing the tax rate from 14% to over 28%. In the past, whenever the Municipal Council increased tax rates, this Association, acting in the interests of taxpayers, invariably expressed opposition. Even the extra two-percent tax that started in the autumn of 1927 was only cancelled last autumn after strenuous efforts. Since the Municipal Council realizes that a straightforward increase is difficult and a unified increase is inconvenient, it is resorting to a strategy of divide and conquer, using a sleight of hand. If we do not strenuously oppose this, allowing it to undermine the fundamental principles of finance and the established practice of the past sixty years, then in the future, the tax rate may remain unchanged, but inflating rents will be enough to satisfy its desire to extract more revenue. How can taxpayers bear this ever-increasing burden? We hereby issue this declaration for public awareness. January 11, 1932.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Interior Approves Temporary Suspension of Dance Hall Ban in Shanghai</h3>
<p>▲Requesting Municipal Government to Determine a Deadline</p>
<p>▲Municipal Government Instructs Public Security Bureau to Review and Reply</p>
<p>On October 20th, the Municipal Government received a communication from the Ministry of Interior regarding the Central Executive Committee's resolution to ban commercial dance halls nationwide to promote social morality. The Municipal Government was instructed to implement the ban in Shanghai. Subsequently, various dance halls in the city, both Chinese and foreign-owned, jointly submitted a petition requesting the Municipal Government to temporarily suspend the ban. The Municipal Government considered that the reasons presented by the dance halls were somewhat justifiable and forwarded the petition to the Ministry of Interior for review on December 19th. It has now been learned that the Municipal Government has recently received a reply from the Ministry of Interior stating that since Shanghai has special circumstances, the request for a temporary suspension of the ban should be approved. However, the Ministry requested the Shanghai Municipal Government to investigate the local situation, determine a deadline, and report back for record-keeping. Upon receiving the communication, the Municipal Government has instructed the Public Security Bureau to comply with the instructions, propose a deadline, and submit a report for review.</p>

Unexpectedly, she gave birth to two babies. The family thought they were twins and did not pay much attention. However, the mother's abdomen did not shrink and she was still in severe pain. The midwife examined her and found that there was still something in her womb and that the placenta had not yet come out. After the midwife applied her skills, another child was born.

<h3>The Path to Be Taken by the Youth National Salvation Movement Wang Le Yi</h3>
<p>Now Jinzhou has fallen, and the Eastern Provinces have been lost. What is the responsibility we bear, and what is the mission we hold? The soldiers advocate the suicidal policy of [non-resistance], which is of course not to be discussed. Even the current national patriotic movement of the youth is mostly going in the wrong direction. They all abandon their studies with a momentary impulsive passion, and run around shouting. If that is not enough, they follow it up with hunger strikes, suicides, or going to the front line to kill the enemy. However, the survival of a country is no more than the collection of three elements: intelligence, military strength, and financial resources. China has millions of soldiers, so it cannot be said that its military strength is not strong. It has vast and fertile land, so it cannot be said that its financial resources are not rich. However, why can't China dominate the world, and even dare not fight Japan, and is in danger of becoming a subjugated slave? This is because its intelligence is inferior to others. Youth is the life force of the nation, the lifeline of the country, and the spirit of society. Now, to make such a meaningless sacrifice, isn't it painful? Isn't it worrying? Some people say [The anti-Japanese work done by young people now is not a national salvation movement, but a national subjugation movement.] Whether this kind of bad evaluation is credible or not, let's ignore it for now, but let us ask ourselves, are we going in the wrong direction and recognizing the wrong goal? Students, please think carefully. Japan was originally a poor and weak country and an oppressed nation, but why is it now so strong and able to dominate the world? Because after the Meiji Restoration, it was able to painstakingly study science and education, and strive to reform social organization and national politics. During the Franco-Prussian War, France was defeated by Prussia, ceded land and paid reparations, and lost its rights and insulted the country. Wasn't it like Japan's treatment of China today? At that time, people from all walks of life in France ran around shouting, and were sad and indignant. However, General Joffre believed that the impulse of emotion and the venting of passion could not last long, and that it was not enough to talk about saving the country without working hard at school. So he decided to study hard and specialize in military knowledge and combat skills. When the European War came, he was indeed able to save France with a bang. During the European War, Germany was beaten to pieces by the countries of the world, and was almost unrecognizable. However, Germany did not perish in the end, and is now turning from weak to strong. Why is this? This is entirely due to the existence of its national soul 丨 academic 丨. Ibsen also told us, [If you want to dedicate yourself to society, it is not enough to succeed unless you cast yourself, this piece of material, into a sharp weapon.] What a far-sighted view this is! Without real and sufficient knowledge and talent, how can you lead the people to save the country and resist foreign insults? Dear young people, these are all good examples that tell us how to save the country fundamentally. Therefore, brothers feel that the path that our national salvation movement should take now, and the fundamental method, is to sit in the library and the laboratory earnestly and carefully to study, invent, manufacture, reform, and enrich the life force of our nation, the lifeline of the country, and the spirit of society. This kind of intellectual preparation of ours is the preparation of national strength. If the national strength is sound, are we still afraid that the national shame will not be avenged? However, young people, books can be read, but dead books cannot be read. During this period of national crisis, we must also step up military training, make physical preparations, and cultivate talents for maintaining public security in the rear. At the same time, we must also sincerely urge the government and earnestly publicize to the people, telling the people the truth about the rampant tyranny of Japan and the crisis of our current lives, and the extremely effective method of resurrection. Doing it so earnestly can wash away the shame of our nation and erase the stain on China. (B)</p>

<h3>Short Forum</h3>
<h3>Shanghai is a Den of Iniquity Fortunately</h3>
<p>The Japanese newspaper carried a piece of local news, which should have been interviewed from the concession authorities, counting in the past year, just in the Public Concession area, there were 33 major murder cases, no less than 25 kidnapping cases reported to the police, and small theft cases, even more difficult to count. In total, the property stolen throughout the year was worth as much as 2,225,000 yuan. The police detained over 17,000 Chinese and foreign criminals throughout the year, and investigated a total of 18,000 cases. If calculated with the whole city, the number would be even greater. This is the explanation of [Shanghai is a den of iniquity]. Indeed, Shanghai is a den of iniquity, not only Shanghai, all cities are dens of devils, all are factories for manufacturing sins. However, if we only cite the above-mentioned murder cases, kidnapping cases, small theft cases, 2,225,000 yuan worth of stolen goods, the 17,000 Chinese and foreign criminals detained by the Public Concession police, the 18,000 cases investigated, and the number which is no less than this when counted with the whole city etc. to explain Shanghai is a den of iniquity, it is very obvious that this explanation is [unfair].</p>
<p>The above-mentioned crimes, such as theft, such as kidnapping, such as murder, of course, are mostly done by friends from the lower classes of society, but here we want to further ask, what about the general officials? [Only officials are allowed to set fires, and common people are not allowed to light lamps], these two common sayings have ruthlessly exposed the black curtain of politics, which of those who are respected and pampered, and who are so upright and commanding the people, is not day and day extracting the blood and sweat of the common people by knocking on the bones and sucking the marrow? Which of them is not directly or indirectly committing acts of plotting wealth and killing lives, but only the means are a little more clever, but only killing people without seeing blood, if someone can add up the stolen goods of this robbery, the number would have to be hundreds or thousands of times more than [2,225,000 yuan], the devil travels in the day, the ghost goes out at night, who can say that the devil is more skilled than the ghost? It is just that people have become accustomed to the devil raging in broad daylight, and habitually think it is [legal], is the sin of Shanghai only done by these clumsy fools with low skills, the lower-class social masses who are eating lawsuits in the police station?</p>
<p>Further said… Why do thefts and robberies happen? Naturally it is due to [hunger and cold pressing], why do people suffer from hunger and cold? [Behind the vermilion gates, wine and meat rot, on the roads, there are frozen bones], [a rich man's feast of wine, a poor man's half-year's rations], corrupt officials have taken away the poor man's food and clothing, but they still say, why were you hungry and cold! At the extreme of hunger and cold, the poor have to steal a little, snatch a little, it is to extend the last gasp of once or twice, but they shout loudly... You restless thugs, you heinous bandits! I want to ask…</p>
<p>[What right does anyone have to say... I am right, you are wrong].</p>
<p>Shanghai is a den of iniquity, how is it only Shanghai? At present, the thing of plotting wealth and killing lives is being planned or practiced anytime and anywhere, criminals, are everywhere, stolen goods, are everywhere, Shanghai is just a corner of the world of sin.</p>
<h3>Canine Mass Literature</h3>
<h3>An [Ah San] Silk</h3>
<p>An [Ah San] stood at the crossroads. He had his head wrapped in cloth, was wearing a copper-buttoned uniform, and was holding a [mourning stick] in his hand, directing the traffic. Like other [Ah Sans]. He was a [bearded man]. Under his dark purple skin, he also had the blood vessels of ordinary humans, in which surged the loyalty, diligence, and even law-abidingness and public service of his profession, no different from other [Ah Sans]. He was almost a robot, his actions and even thoughts were mechanical. In his eyes, the people, things, and events he saw were more than anyone who was not a [patrolman], but what did he feel!</p>
<p>In the vast crowd, two of his compatriots walked over there, a man and a woman. The man was wearing high-quality gentleman's clothing, and was also a tall and extraordinary figure. Except for his complexion, he was indeed the image of a [British man]. The woman, however, was still dressed in the style of her homeland, light silk or satin wrapped around her head, body, and legs, making it impossible for us to tell whether it was a hat, a coat, or a skirt. However, she was very young and exquisite, with the usual willow eyebrows and almond eyes, a slender neck and a long waist, so that when we looked at her skin, we would call her a [black rose]. He and she walked hand in hand, gradually approaching the standing [Ah San]. He, [Ah San], suddenly froze, just like a machine that suddenly suffered an accident. The hand he raised holding the stick suddenly stopped moving up and down, his shoulders shrugged up, his chest stuck out, and he used all his energy on his two eyes, slowly turning his neck, watching the two compatriots approach his side 丨 walk past his front 丨. But in a moment, what he saw became two shadows from the back; one like a fat cow, a giant elephant, and the other like a dependent little bird, a fluttering butterfly. After another moment, the shadow from the back turned the corner and disappeared, and only then did he seem to have relieved himself of a major responsibility, exhaling a long, deep breath, while at the same time his chest collapsed, his shoulders lowered, his head lowered, his eyes looking at the ground, as if searching for something, so that he forgot to put down the stick in his hand, and could not hear the cars waiting behind him, honking incessantly.</p>
<p>Popular Science</p>
<h3>Invention of Vital Substances</h3>
<p>Advertisements in shops, whether Eastern or Western, all like to call themselves Vitamin. The translated meaning of Vitamin is Vital Substance. The ones that have been experimentally verified and are available for application are now divided into four types: A, B, C, and D!</p>
<p>The amount of vital substances in food varies. For example, milk is rich in Vitamin A, eggs are rich in both Vitamins A and D, and rice bran contains Vitamin B. Spinach in Western food contains Vitamins A, B, and C. Fresh fruits, potatoes, and radishes are rich in Vitamin C. Tomatoes are rich in Vitamins B and C. Milk and flour that have been irradiated with ultraviolet light are rich in Vitamin D. In addition, newly manufactured Western medicines also contain certain vital substances. However, by means of biochemical experiments, through artificial invention, to extract pure crystalline vital substances, or to set up a method for mass production, has not yet been heard of.</p>
<p>Recently, Professor Enler Cbelpin, a Swedish biochemical expert, has been experimenting with manufacturing new substances that are very rich in Vitamin A. Master Ottar Rygh, a university lecturer in Norway, has been developing Vitamin C. Mr. Adolf Windauss of Germany and Messrs. E.H. Reerib U隅 and A. Van Wijk of Philips Electric Factory in the Netherlands have extracted ergot bacteria parasitic between naked rye flowers, extracted ergot oil Ergesterine, and irradiated it with ultraviolet light to produce pure crystalline Vitamin D. However, the pure crystalline form of Vitamin B has not yet been announced by any inventor.</p>
<p>According to the 11th century and after, before the 15th century, Green Island in northeastern America had become a new state specially built by Norwegian expatriates. At that time, the grain and vegetables of Green Island all depended on the Norwegian king to send special ships to supply them continuously. After the 15th century, the contact between Norway and Green Island suddenly ceased. The Norwegians living on the island relied on fish and meat to fill their stomachs. Before several generations, they all died. This is enough to know that meat eaters often suffer from bleeding disorders due to the lack of Vitamin C, which leads to self-destruction of their lives.</p>
<p>As for the lack of Vitamin A leading to physical underdevelopment, and the lack of Vitamin D leading to the occurrence of rickets, it is only limited to a part of children, not as harmful as the lack of Vitamin C. Those who lack Vitamin B are prone to beriberi, which is only encountered in tropical India. And if the rice is not degermed too much, this substance is still easy to retain, and is still far less helpless than those who lack fresh fruits and vegetables and cannot obtain Vitamin C.</p>

<h3>All Kinds of Ways of Life Xing Zi</h3>
<p>Here, I am not writing a chronicle of life for the rich, but I want to depict a picture of [lingering death] 1) I came out of a civilian hospital in front of the Great World, and just when I got to the road, someone behind me suddenly made a strange cry. Looking back, there was a head with disheveled hair and a face as yellow and withered as wax, who stepped forward to greet me with a bitter and pleading look.</p>
<p>[Sir, I was originally a student at the ×× School in Japan. When the Northeast Incident happened, I returned to my country. Unfortunately, I fell ill as soon as I arrived in Shanghai. Now I don't have a penny on me, and I don't have the travel expenses to go home. Seeing that you are also a learned person, a gentleman, you should be able to pity me. No matter how much, please help me with a little travel expenses.]</p>
<p>I touched my body, and there was only one corner left, and I had to go to a very far place, so I simply replied to him... [I'm sorry, I don't have much money on me].</p>
<p>But he was not disappointed by my reply, and still followed me step by step.</p>
<p>[Sir, no matter how much, it's my good fortune to meet you. This is only once, there will never be a second time, and maybe I will have a day to raise my eyebrows and exhale. Who can judge a person's future based on his present?]</p>
<p>His words were very touching, and did not sound like the talk of a friend who specializes in [patrolling the road]. I walked to the New World, and he was still following behind me. I secretly thought... [This guy's determination and perseverance to get money is not bad].</p>
<p>I exchanged the only corner of double horns, left the necessary tram fare, and gave the rest to him. He diligently sent me a road, and I watched his disheveled head gradually being swallowed by the sea of people, and I felt very uneasy in my heart. Half a month later, on another road, a strange cry came from behind me again. Looking back, it was still the disheveled head and the yellow wax face, but when he saw me clearly, a disappointed sorrow suddenly emerged in his pleading eyes. He casually took out a few copper coins and gave them to him, and I said with a smile... [Friend, the three lives stone has destined us to have two meetings].</p>

<h3>The Aviation King, Eckener</h3>
<p>Count Zeppelin, when he initially planned to build the airship, the majority of the funding was willingly raised by enthusiastic citizens. However, as soon as it took flight, the engine broke down, and it had to land for repairs.</p>
<p>After the first failure, a reporter vehemently criticized him in the newspaper. Zeppelin, reading this article signed [Eckener], felt truly terrified.</p>
<p>After the second failure, Zeppelin, feeling disheartened and terrified, picked up the newspaper to read it again. However, this time, it surprised him greatly.</p>
<p>[The Zeppelin airship is another great failure, but its failure unfolds great hopes for the future. I hope Count Zeppelin can hold onto the spirit of perseverance and make a comeback.]</p>
<p>These sentences, filled with goodwill and sympathy, revived his sorrowful mood. From then on, Zeppelin became connected with Dr. Eckener. Yesterday's enemy became today's comrade. Therefore, Eckener inherited Zeppelin's ambition and completed the great aviation enterprise of circumnavigating the world.</p>
<p>Shanghai Stories</p>
<h3>Shanghai Stories (6) Zhou Rong</h3>
<p>× The First British Consul in Shanghai</p>
<p>In the twenty-third year of the Daoguang reign (i.e., November 8, 1843, Gregorian calendar), British Consul to Shanghai, Colonel Balfour (i.e., Captain George Balfour), arrived in Shanghai from Guangzhou. He had been an officer in the Indian artillery and was recommended by Pottinger to be reassigned as the Consul in Shanghai. The next day, he paid a visit to Gong Mu-jiu, the Daotai of Songjiang, Suzhou, and Taicang. Gong Mu-jiu also returned the visit on the Medusa steamship.</p>
<p>The first problem the British Consul faced upon arriving in Shanghai was renting a consulate. A large house with a total of fifty-two rooms was rented between the West Gate and the East Gate, with an annual rent of four hundred yuan.</p>
<p>When the Treaty of Nanjing was signed, Pottinger did not mention the establishment of foreign settlements. At this time, Consul Balfour and the Daotai of Songjiang, Suzhou, and Taicang discussed this issue. Initially, the Daotai did not recognize the right of foreigners to purchase land in Shanghai but allowed them to continue leasing land permanently, with lessees paying annual rent.</p>
<p>At that time, the land price in Shanghai was 15,000 to 35,000 copper coins per mu, with approximately one silver dollar equivalent to 1,000 copper coins. Later, due to foreigners purchasing land, the price rose to 50,000 to 60,000 copper coins per mu. However, the land rent was only 1,500 copper coins per mu per year, equivalent to about one tael of government silver.</p>
<p>× The Initial Scope of the Settlement</p>
<p>The initial establishment of the settlement did not have a fixed scope: generally, it extended east to the Huangpu River, south to the Yangjingbang Creek, north to Beijing Road, and the western boundary was yet to be determined. Later, the western boundary was expanded to Henan Road, and the included area was initially only 150 acres (each acre being equivalent to approximately 6.58 Chinese mu). The terrain within the settlement was high, originally a cultivated area with crisscrossing ditches and tombs.</p>
<p>When local landowners sold land to foreigners, they requested that foreigners protect the tombs and allow them to sweep the tombs on time each year. Several years after the establishment of the settlement, the area west of the current Sichuan Road was still countryside. The Bund area was originally a small path along the riverbank used by boatmen for hauling, which was sometimes submerged by the tide during high tide.</p>
<p>Although the scope of the settlement was defined, there was still a significant difficulty that foreigners could not overcome, which was that many landowners were unwilling to sell their land. Even if they were willing, they demanded exorbitant prices. Even after the sale, they often delayed their departure from their original homes with various excuses. Therefore, due to relocation, local residents and landowners were subjected to considerable pressure from foreigners. (To be continued)</p>
