<p>九三老人馬相伯語录　記</p>
<h3>烙鐵與水瘡，門牙與當兵。</h3>
<p>吾初到上海的時候，外國的科學祇是萌芽。吾可以説看牠發逹起來。奇得很，在這八十年來，科學的發逹　眞了不得。　　講到醫學，這八十年來突飛猛進，不可思議。那時，吾見到的外國醫生，所用的診斷方法非常幼稚。譬如治水泡瘡，用火燒紅了烙鐵，再用烙鐵來燙瘡頭，攻熱用寒，攻寒用熱，以毒攻毒，其方法的野蠻，和中國的走方郎中實在没有什麽分别。　　講到軍器，也是非常幼稚。吾還記得那時由徐匯公學的敎師領導，纔到停泊上海的外國兵艦上去參觀。那時，兵艦上的機械很簡單，什麽都没有，關於電的應用，那時完全没有。艦上的砲旣不能升降高低，也不能盤旋左右，更没有準頭，和中國的土砲實在没有多大分别。</p>
<p>那時候的步槍還是前膛的。像現在硬殻的子彈還没有。火藥還是用紙包的，必須用牙齒咬開了紙頭，才後擺在槍膛裹，用管子推了，才後放出。像這樣開槍，必須具備一副鋭利的牙齒。否則，手持搶還没有酸，牙骨就要格格作痛了。所以，好笑得很，那時，法國初行徵兵，少壯人民都怕當兵，很多人民就敲壞了門牙，藉此可以不當兵，因爲那時門牙若有損壞，就不配當兵了。</p>

<p>蘇俄是現代世界上一個嶄新的，最有希望的國家。如今他們全國的人民，都正在忙着一件工作，那就是完成具有國防意味的五年計劃。他們預備在五年之内，要一定造成許多鐵路，開成許多工廠，墾成許多荒地，辦成許多學校。因爲全國上下的切實努力（不是貼標語，喊口號的努力，）所以現在這個五年計劃，有許多是已經成功了，有許多是將近成功了，世界各國，無不讚羨。俄國的兒童，都是社會主義的小戰士，也極力帮助國家，從事建設。下面便是俄國兒童的小五年計劃。（一）要發現地質的石灰層和燐層，作爲肥料之用。（二）每個兒童，每年至少要收集二十公斤的舊物，如破布。繩索，羊毛，骨頭，金屬碎片等，供給工廠，當原料應用。（三）要製造無線電話的匣子和擴聲喇叭。務於五年之中，在全國農村安置七萬五千個無線電話匣子，每一個學校，都應該有一個擴聲喇叭的無線電話。（四）要在國家農塲的榖類中，選擇優良種子。（五）每個兒童，每年要至少收集兩噸肥田灰。（六）每個兒童，每年要擊殺十隻田鼠，清除一千立方米突有寄生蟲的土地，撲滅一棵樹上和十棵蔬菜上的害蟲，捕殺五隻大鼠與十隻小鼠。（七）每個兒童，每年要建造一所掠鳥房（捕捉害鳥，）兩所飼鳥房（保護益鳥。）五年之中，要在全國把掠鳥房增加到一百五十萬所，飼鳥房增加到一百萬所。（八）要在五年中，組織五千個兒童養鳥會，設立五千所合作的家禽塲（餵養鷄　鴨等，）建造五千所鷄塒。（九）每個兒童，每年要帮助一户農家，增加一對良好的產卵母雞。（十）每個兒童，要每年種十棵樹。五年之内，在全國成立一個有着七千五百萬棵樹木的兒童森林。（十）（一）每個兒童，要撲滅臭蟲，油蟲，蒼蠅，每年清掃十所房屋。（十）（二）要帮助成人，識字，五年之内，掃蕩全國的文言。　　唉！中國兒童的五年計劃在那裹？中國成人的五年計劃在那裹？中國政府的五年計劃在那裹？（却酬）</p>
<h3>廚斗</h3>
<p>— 陶在東</p>
<p>瘟生毫不客氣的説。滿漢酒席一桌。與其送近親。不如送遠鄰。近親饖而很。一掃光。遠鄰客氣些。飽也。與其送一家。不如送多家。一家獨吞。没回扣　多家均勢下。有漏銷。又可截曠也。青年大怒日。好好酒席。自已不會享用嗎。爲何胡説送近親送遠鄰。瘟生日。酒席呵。不過原則上通過。菜單之方案。正在起草。質言之。只有宣傳之酒席。並没有建設之酒席。老實説。山珍還在山中。海錯尚在海裹。現有材料。不過鷄鴨魚肉而已。青年色稍和曰。將就些。請廚子做呀·瘟生曰。説説易。做來難。最初廚子腐化。魚餧而肉敗。紹興豆腐哺胎蛋。臭而不可聞也。其次廚子惡化。怒髮冲冠的魚翅。酒色過度的鴨子。不能吃。此種惡化腐化份子。當然打倒。改聘專家。不分畛域。集中人才。誰知更壞。四川廚子主辣。樣樣辣椒辣得要命。粤廚主甜。無菜而不蜜　。甜也難受。北平廚子主張　食。饅頭燒餅紮</p>

<h3>大風堂上讀會碑（下）</h3>
<p>— 自在</p>
<p>久之。其友李文潔公瑞清號清道人者。方　書滬上。　餬口自活。爲書招君曰。家居碌碌。盍來與我共一旦之命乎。於是遂走主清道人。君於書與清道人同淵源。皆務復古。習秦漢篆隸。而後專藉六朝碑體。盡其態。清道人殁。君踵起。名益振。四方　重值求索不絶。歲所赢。輒推濟族戚交朋窮乏者。君事母極孝。終其身語及襁褓中母　侵陵禦侮保孤狀。未嘗不流涕。於清道人爲卜葬金陵牛首山。築祠置祀田。世尤高其風誼焉。在滬居僻巷。而賓友或門弟子常滿座。砋古貎白鬚。呴呴披肝膈絮語。故親附者衆。晚歲喜購其先名輩遺迹。餘興效作盡。崛奇出天授。一日。余過君。有自寫潑墨山水。裝池懸齋壁。雜清湘石濤諸幅間。余誤而并贊之。君掀髯狂笑曰。老夫區區戲墨。亦可亂眞邪。余即自承爲誤。又摇手曰。不得言誤也。其風趣詼詭類如此。君年躋七十。庚午七月四日病卒。所著有古氏問難十卷。春秋大事表二卷。歷代帝王年表兩卷。和陶詩兩卷。書　録文集各若干卷。曾王考諱某。王考諱記飲。才諱廣　。妣氏劉。旌表節孝。國史館立傳。配湯恭人。所出子曰摰。曰述。曰卓。女二。適譚適夏。繼配萬恭人。所出子憲珂。孫男　人。孫女四人。曾孫一人。是年九月歸葬於衡陽界脾峴塘衝。其孤摰走匡廬山居乞銘。余於君號生平最狎習者也。撰次事狀所未備。系以辭曰。亂驅一老投海裔。巧救飢腸厠　藝。初接黄冠騁聯轡。喪朋文采獨照世。飄髯蜃樓閲年歲。萬靈踴躍役運髯。立身本末根孝義。墨痕隱　思親淚。道存亡命缅高致。流風盪摩復誰嗣。魂合岳氣片石瘞。　補聲詩導肆志。醬　。呌人撑死。寗波廚子説。中菜不合潮流。阿拉第一春番菜好。蘇州廚娘。折衷派也。以礄音喊口號。中菜西吃。唱高調的廚子説。天廚天味香味種種莊嚴。意見不同。主張互異。主人方延賓客。排席簽。忽而大聲發於廚下。廚子鬭矣。但只見北派廚子拿趕　杖挺進。南派廚子抄鍋　作殊死戰。邊派廚子據水缸爲防禦。到底廚娘女流。率其毛丫頭。縮短戰線。爲有秩序之退却。打雜的趁勢打冷拳。管帳的乘機開花帳。當是時鍋翻甑仰。碗盞横飛。一塲惡戰。賓客從餓鬼道中來。都要竊嘗一臠。有一客竟耍無賴。强搶　包。實行倒竈。主人呌苦不迭。只好對客抗議説貴客須負責任。因從前大家説過保全廚房之完整也。</p>
<h3>戎馬雙樓記（六六）</h3>
<p>— 求幸福齋主人</p>
<p>第八回　無邊哀怨懺情中難期曠逹·極度聲歌行樂裹得覩威嚴不過他換衣服比梁笑雲化妝的工夫究簡易得多。在很迅速的換好之後。誠恐還有什麽不妥帖之處。特擺進去請梁笑雲這個新就職的專門敎師。先行過目審查一番。也畢竟伊是目光如炬。别有專長。隨便一看就指出他那雙皮鞋穿得不稱。要再換上一雙雙梁粉底緞鞋。和配上一雙白絲襪子。又命他換好鞋襪後就在書房裹好生陪伴那位毛手毛脚的毛副官。不管人家是幹什麽的。旣掛著軍界中上尉官的肩牌。又是五太太身邊的紅人。便當看他主人的面子。好好以客禮相待。千萬不要再像從前那般呆板板的不隨和。招這種小人不痛快。須知將來最要利用他們圖種種的便利。做官如同演戲。就是與他以哥弟相稱。也不爲吃虧啊。安玉田雖不甚願意。但不敢公然違抗。只好委屈著自已。勉强去和毛德順假扮嘴臉的敷衍一回。無奈極客氣的笑臉還好裝。那一套昧心兒瞎扯淡的鬼話。比做文章還難。總縐不出那許多來消磨這個很長的時間。好容易受了一大陣的窘。和盼到梁笑雲通體妝成。笑盈盈的走過來。卸了他一身重負。與毛德順拉拉扯扯的一同上車。因那毛德順讓德可嘉。自知分量。再三不肯到車廂裹與他們伉　並體同坐。一跳就跳到車前面汽車夫旁邊的寳座上。還是任他們二位偎依親密。如膠似漆。梁笑雲又乘便耳提面命。敎導安玉田等會兒見了葉大帥。不可心慌意亂。過於拘謹。應該放大了膽侃侃而談。多表現自已的幹練。老葉那種人是粗豪的性子。只喜歡别人言談爽快。而頂膩煩扭揑迂腐。你初次見面。總以立刻就能打動他的爲妙。安玉田想想這又是一個難題。眞不能説是有把握可以一定做好。更可見平日那樣自命不凡。實屬不知天高地厚。如今僅低首下心去做卑鄙無恥的勾當。就已黑漆一團摸不著半點門。比小學生還幼稚。那還算有什麽閲歷和能爲。從今跟伊走一步學一步。摸牆扶壁一般。遇事只試探著朝前辦。試到那裹算那裹。還不敢準説　樣全學得到家呢。</p>

<h3>閘北貨　蘭竹枝銷路呆滯</h3>

<h3>五金</h3>
<h3>紫銅巿價江河日下</h3>
<p>紫銅交易自停戰來`驟形寂寞`雖本街船廠家及客帮等俱有點綴`惟爲數寥寥`故對於巿情頗有難見榮辱之慨`最近幾日洋行方面緣六月底結賬期近`（六月底爲銀行半年結賬期）故對於客户未出之貨`莫不頻催`查紫銅一項`在滬之未出貨共有五六百噸之多`因金融上關係`洋行方面不得不忍痛出售`所以近日在巿上攬售之現貨`十分衆多`而標準前途莫不大受打擊`故近巿祇開三十七兩五錢`比上週跌一兩半`較週初則跌七錢半`但貨多求少`人心恐怖`所以來日行情　頗有江河日下之慨`</p>

<h3>敬告投稿諸君</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>本刊自改革以來，荷蒙諸君迭頒名著，無任欣　，惟以篇幅有限，致鉅著鴻文，未能盡最披露，殊爲抱疚，至本刊宗旨，業已兩次陳述於諸君之前，諒早已鑒及，蓋本刊宗旨，一方爲提倡小生活小工藝，故每天有科學常識一欄，用備熱心工藝者之參考，一方欲改良社會，力矯奢侈，力排虚僞，用將奇形發展的上海社會，盡情暴露其弱點，原是彰善殫惡之意，因上海爲文化的結晶，社會之模範，四方觀摹，羣相則效，故影響所及，不僅一隅，用再擬具標準數項，以供諸君之參考，（一）家庭生活　現在新舊家庭之衝突，旣無可諱言，（即大家庭與小家庭）這原是新舊思想消長之結果，故照現在的趨勢，大家庭制度，原無存在之可能，可否把舊家庭制度不良之處，從一枝一節中，描寫出來，（描寫的方法，决不要概括的寫出，要從一點一點寫出，即小見大，即微見著，方有佳文，以下諸項，亦是如此，）（一）學堂寫眞　學堂爲文化中心，關於國家前途，異常密切，而上海學堂，認眞辦理者，固屬甚多，而以營業爲目的者，原亦不在少數，影響所及，國運有關，不可不注意及之，故第一欲描寫學校的生業化，第二描寫撒爛污的敎員，第三描寫學生的貴族化，與浪漫生活，（一）生意經絡　中國商業的墮落，一方固由於製造的不能改善，而又一方面，則商人絶對不懂做生意經絡，無論何人，曾經一度到過上海者，（久處上海者不必説）咸知上海商人，架子很辣，不論公司商號，生意愈好，面孔愈板，與他交易，猶如尋仇，殊失做生意的本意，此其一也，又商人的面孔，亦看顧客程度而異其面目，如對汽車階級，一付面孔，對待平民階級，又一付面孔，對待摩登女子與對待鄕村老婦，又各有各的面孔，實非商人應取的態度，可否將他們一付勢利面孔與手段，活龍活現地寫出，（一）上海社會　上海社會，奢侈極矣，虚僞極矣，墮落極矣，現在的社會，不是沿襲滿清的惡習，便是摹仿歐美的皮毛，例如婚喪等事窮極奢侈不必説，即阿大的娘養了一個阿二，亦要發發帖子請請客，尋了二十四塊錢，二十三塊半着在身上，凡此種種不可殫述，諸君能於一事二事中攻破其弱點否，（一）性的追求　性的問題，未嘗不可以描寫，孟子曰食色性也，但是上海社會之中，男性有黨人（不是國民黨的黨）色彩者，本屬不少，而女性中，亦難保其必無，此亦不謂非事實也，不過要寫得高尚，寫得隱藏，寫得深刻，寫得實情，决不可寫得赤裸裸，要寫得如紅樓夢，不可寫得如肉蒲團，（一）社會黑幕　上海社會，黑幕重重，筆難盡述，即本刊中已揭載者，亦已不少，即如弄堂寫眞之類，其中確有很好的資料，自有登載之價值，但要寫得生動，不可泥滯，要寫得有趣，不可穢亵，以上幾點，務請諸君照此標準，源源惠稿，不勝盼企，惟上海社會，往往有許多奇怪的事，不能以常理測，不可以形跡拘，例如如此物質文明之上海巿中，偏有紅廟吳鑒光等，香火之盛，世所希見，此中情形，豈可理測，諸君如有發見此項情形，本刊亦所歡迎，僕之所陳不過舉其梗槪而已，若神而明之，惟視諸君觀點之如何及描寫之如何矣，臨頴不勝盼感之至，文藝</p>
<h3>時事雜詠</h3>
<p>— 陳葆仁</p>
<p>東風吹雨又清明，胡騎紛紛入漢城，怪底貔貅軍十萬，但將和議答昇平，　　大砲雷轟戰艦高，連營海上擁旌旄，後軍無繼輸全局，慘聽江聲吼怒濤，　　軋軋機聲動地來，吳淞回首有餘哀，海濱風木多餘燼，淚洒江頭話刦灰，　　戰血猶腥骨未寒，忍從坵礫話悲歡，沙蟲猿鶴憑誰拯，如畫江山不忍看，</p>

<h3>線外線與維他命D</h3>
<p>— 冰影</p>
<p>我見了六日本刊科學欄内濟君所寫的一篇維太命文字，極感謝他能夠把大衆所需要的，而且能夠實騐的科學常識介紹給我們，不過其中關於維太命D······在日光及太陽燈光中含得有一節學説，我覺得濟君太忽略了，恐怕現今的科學家，尚不能發明這樣神秘的事實呢？倘如讀者諸君不信，請看我把十七卷十二期的婦女雜誌内，關於維太命D的文字，老實地直摘下來，作一個印證罷。　　據科學家説，日光與維太命D有極大的關係。日光以及其他爲紫外線之源的光線，能夠防止或治療小兒軟骨病，其效幾與魚肝油相同，這原因是爲紫外線能在人體中製造出維太命D來的，　　有許多植物及動物丨即人也包括在内丨體内含有一種化學質，名曰Ergostoral這東西如被照射於紫外線之下，便變爲另一種的化學質，即就是維他命D，所以如把患軟骨病的小孩，照射於日光或紫外線之下，則體中Ergostoral便變爲維太命，與魚肝油所供給的，一般無二，大抵吾人只要能服食足量的鮮蛋，便儘夠供給足量的維太命D而不必另用人爲的方法，或精製的材料，</p>

<h3>祝由科</h3>
<p>— 你</p>
<p>爲了多受濕氣，兩腿有些麻木，走起來總覺有些不方便，所以便想請醫生給我醫一下，　　事出凑巧，剛走出門口，突然有人遞給我一張傳單，我以爲不是××黨的，便是郵政局的罷工宣言，一看之下，不，不，原來是三代祖傳的祝由科×××奉送各界醫病十天　　我最怕生病，因爲生病就得請敎醫生，西醫要强我打針，中醫一定要呌我吃苦水，所以不病倒也罷了，病起來好呌我痛哭流涕，　　如今謝天謝地，不打針，不吃苦水，又不用拿出高代價的掛號金，便可醫我的兩腿，這等便宜事，何樂而不爲？大好時機，不可失之交臂，換轉方向，開步就走，　　一條臭到不堪的衖堂，我經過了，其次我走進一間灰黑色的房子，　　一個長着半下巴黄鬚的[老夫子]把我的兩腿看了一看，隨後點着一股香，拿根鐵鍼，在香上燻了一會子，口中念念有詞，向着他面前用黄紙包的木頭剌去，[痛嗎？]他掉頭問，[······不，]我的腿連癢也不癢，何况痛？終於在幾秒鐘的遲疑後掉出這個回答來，　　[那末酸溜溜？阿覺着熱烘烘？]他那不純熟的國語，終於換了本地白，　　[······不，[　　[噢！勿對哉！勿痛勿酸，勿熱烘烘，勿好，勿好]一大堆[勿]字從他口中播散在空間，　　他又接着説下去[儂一定犯仔××星，兩隻脚要風癱，要是不給我三塊錫箔，將儂解解，此症一定難好，我地答（這裹）鞋（也）可以代買錫箔，]　　我不理他，　　醫病的手續完了，他給我兩粒丸藥，向我要去四隻八開，末了，在[吃完仔再來]聲中，把我送出他的[寳號]，</p>

<h3>記口琴隊的慰勞</h3>
<p>— 趙書卓</p>
<p>和熙的天氣把我們吹開上海了，我們口琴隊的同志，都充滿了快意，離開了鐵蹄下的上海，離開了黄金遮没了自然的上海，别了上海，上海别了，　　兩岸的緑翠映入眼簾，和愛的農夫耕着他的田地，可是他們没有詩人那樣的情緖，美麗的夏天來了，他們亦没有摩登青年的感想，應該怎樣陶醉這風光迷人的風裹，他們祇曉得這是應該耕種的時候就是了，　　船不息地進着，我們大家都談着，要把這小小的口琴吹昨敵兵回東京去，但這亦不過是我們大家吹吹而已，　　夕陽顯出最後的掙扎，河水吐出無限的愁波，黑夜臨來了，船不息地進着，我們隨便談着，的確，吳門的月亮是很幽淡，但亦引不起我們多大懷意，關鐘告訴我們，時候已是深夜二點了，船笛長吼了一聲，蘇州到了，　　來吧，朋友丨歌吧，朋友丨於是我們大家都歌着，要把這蒼老城裹的人歌醒，走入閶門，人們雖没有睡，但他們又何嘗是醒的呢？雀戰聲，歌女的　樂聲，······一切一切都是原來的蘇城，　　十六個鐘頭船上的蟄坐，亦實在使我們疲乏了，而且明天還要大吹，所以我們不得不早點休息了，　　我們都覺得很痛心，爲什麽我們不能在上海慰勞他們？他們亦很慙愧的，退出了上海，而且還受到上海民衆的慰勞，兩邊心裹飽受了無限悲痛，不過吸丨看丨彼此都很了解的，　　説到慰勞他們，我們眞不敢當，每到一個地方專車，專船，演奏之後，總是很好的飯菜，劉俠任同志説，前線的飯又粗糙又甜蜜，甜蜜是甜蜜，可是並不粗糙，當然這是特别爲我們的，説到慰勞呢，是他們慰勞我們，並不是我們慰勞他們，　　在一五六旅旅部，我們要求翁旅長與太倉得來的戰利品攝一影，他説這東西太小了，等我拿到×纔給你們攝照，　　二十七日到太倉慰勞，奏完之後，翁旅長送上船，每人都受了交通處送的一條毛巾，張勵旅長送的書，而且還受了不該受翁旅的一百元作爲川資，末了</p>
<p>的話呀！　　别了太倉，别了親愛的弟兄們，唉！上海會！快點吧，（却酬）</p>

<h3>50,000 Soldiers and Civilians</h3>
<h3>Public Memorial for Martyrs of the Shanghai-Songhu Battles</h3>
<p>A solemn and grand memorial service was held in Suzhou to commemorate the fallen soldiers. The chief officiant, Ju Zheng, delivered a eulogy and presented a wreath. Cai Tingkai and others were deeply saddened by the portraits of the fallen soldiers. A public announcement from the memorial service vowed to avenge the martyrs. During the Shanghai-Songhu battles, the soldiers of the 19th Route Army and the 5th Army fought valiantly for a month, with thousands sacrificing their lives. The government and the people remembered their loyalty and bravery. At 11:20 AM yesterday, a memorial service for the fallen soldiers of the Shanghai Anti-Japanese War was held at the Suzhou Public Stadium (also known as the Fifth Park). Representatives from the Central Government, the Nationalist Government, various military and political organizations, and civic groups attended, totaling over 50,000 soldiers and civilians. In the somber atmosphere of the rainy day, a solemn ceremony was held. Many participants were moved to tears. The details of the event are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Tight Security at the Venue</h3>
<p>Security throughout Suzhou yesterday was ensured through prior police meetings held by the 19th Route Army to discuss defense arrangements. A regiment of military police and several battalions of regular troops were deployed by the military headquarters to key locations inside and outside the city, with the most important areas being the Guangji Bridge entrance outside Changmen, the post office entrance, and the Changmen gate. Security was especially tight there. Mao Naigong, the head of the County Public Security Bureau, and Deng Wenjiong, the representative of the tax police, served as commanders of the venue that day. They personally led public security officers, bicycle patrol teams, and tax police to maintain order at the venue and its surroundings. Railway police were responsible for security at the train station. The entire city was on high alert, creating a serious and solemn atmosphere.</p>
<h3>List of Event Staff</h3>
<p>The list of personnel for the memorial service is as follows: Ju Zheng, Central Committee Member, served as the chief officiant. Kong Xiangxi served as the co-officiant. Other co-officiants included Duan Xipeng, representing Executive Yuan President Wang Jingwei, and Li Jishen, representing Military Affairs Commission Chairman Jiang Jieshi. The presidium consisted of Chen Mingshu, Jiang Guangding, Cai Tingkai, Zhang Zhizhong, and Dai Ji. Weng Zhaoyuan served as the overall commander of the venue, and Deng Wenjiong and Mao Naigong served as commanders. Attendees included Jiao Yitang and Ma Chaojun, representing the Legislative Yuan; Chen, representing the Ministry of Military Affairs; Ti, representing the Central Military Academy; Liu Zhi, Commander of the First Army; Lu Xu, Chief Advisor of the Jiangsu Provincial Security Department; Xia Douyin, Commander of the Wuhan Garrison; Xu Yanfei, representative; Chief of Staff Xuan Xianwu, representing the 88th Division; Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, and Zheng Chengqing, representing the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce; Wang Binyan, representing the Shanghai Defense Corps; Zhang Yi, representing Wuxian; Yang Dezhao, representing Chen Jitang; Zhang Xiaoshan, representing Fu Zuoyi; He Xiangning, Fang Juehui, Wang Qi, and Dai Huaisheng from the central government; and five representatives from India, including Qie Nansheng. There were hundreds of people in attendance. There were also representatives and guests from various schools, organizations, and institutions, along with approximately 50,000 soldiers at the venue.</p>
<h3>Scene at the Opening of the Ceremony</h3>
<p>The ceremony was originally scheduled to begin at 10:00 AM, but due to delays in preparations, it did not commence until 11:20 AM. After the military band sounded the bugle, over ten thousand representatives from various divisions and brigades immediately assembled and lined up in the venue in an orderly manner. Led by overall commander Weng Zhaoyuan, chief officiant Ju Zheng, co-officiants Kong Xiangxi and Li Jishen, and others took their seats. At that moment, the military fired nine salutes, evoking memories of the tragic Shanghai-Songhu battles. After the cannon fire, the China Alarm Bell Society rang alarm bells. The venue was completely silent, and the sound of the alarm bells was especially loud and moving. Then, everyone stood at attention, sang songs, the chief officiant presented wreaths, read the eulogy, and shouted slogans before dispersing. It was 12:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Ju Zheng's Eulogy</h3>
<p>When the master of ceremonies announced that the chief officiant would deliver a eulogy, Ju Zheng slowly stepped forward, took the wreath with both hands, and presented it before the memorial tablets. Then, he addressed the audience and said, "Today, brothers, I am here on behalf of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang to attend the memorial service for the fallen soldiers of the Shanghai-Songhu battles and offer my condolences. I would like to say a few words: (1) For thousands of years, the Chinese nation has been repeatedly subjected to foreign aggression. Now, with the Shanghai Anti-Japanese War, we have recalled the national spirit, so that no one dares to humiliate us again. (2) The people of the whole country have finally risen up together today. All kinds of organizations, groups, agriculture, industry, commerce, education, and soldiers must unite in spirit to eliminate national disasters and consolidate the foundation of the people. (3) From today onwards, the Chinese Kuomintang will consistently implement and promote the political platform and teachings left by Sun Yat-sen, so that the country will become more advanced and its international standing will be enhanced." After Ju Zheng finished his speech, Kong Xiangxi, representing the Nationalist Government, Duan Xipeng, representing the Executive Yuan, Chen, representing the Ministry of Military Affairs, Li Jishen, representing the Military Affairs Commission, and the participants in the ceremony, Jiang Guangding, Cai Tingkai, Zhang Zhizhong, Dai Ji, and others, offered their condolences, presented wreaths, read eulogies, and then departed. The full scene of the memorial service was photographed by Li Zunyong.</p>
<h3>Eulogy by the Chief Officiant</h3>
<p>The eulogy by the chief officiant Ju Zheng read: "On this 28th day of May in the 21st year of the Republic of China, I respectfully pay tribute to the spirits of the fallen soldiers of the Shanghai-Songhu battles, following in the footsteps of the elders, brothers, sisters, and all compatriots. I offer these words: Heaven has brought misfortune to China, and disasters never cease. The Japanese invaders are rampant, and the entire nation is united in hatred. To save this precarious situation, we rely on the brave soldiers. They die alongside the enemy, wishing to resolve the hidden worries of 400 million compatriots. Their bodies are wrapped in horse hides, and tears overflow across the land. Their heroic voices spread far and wide, and their righteousness endures. Alas, the world is turbulent, and some show servile faces and bent knees to the enemy. The heroic sacrifices of these soldiers will be admired by future generations for thousands of years."</p>
<h3>Female Students Singing a Dirge</h3>
<p>Female students from Suzhou Girls' Middle School sang a dirge to commemorate the fallen soldiers. The lyrics read: "Alas, our soldiers, the nation's martyrs, unparalleled in loyalty and bravery. Though their bodies are dead, their spirits live on, adding glory to the nation. Looking back at that time, they resisted with all their hearts, how tragic and heroic. Alas, the fallen men wrapped in horse hides are so mournful, so mournful. Shed blood and tears, offer sacrifices and incense, and present clear wine. May your spirits come and enjoy. May the heroic spirits intimidate the enemy and their battle records flow eternally in history."</p>
<h3>Cai Tingkai's Grief</h3>
<p>At 11:15 AM, Cai Tingkai slowly entered the venue. After ascending the altar, he went to pay respects before the portraits of the fallen soldiers. Then, he stood alongside his division and brigade commanders on the right side of the memorial platform. His face was filled with grief, and he remained silent, repeatedly looking back at the portraits of the fallen soldiers, as if praying silently. When the master of ceremonies announced the opening of the ceremony and the singing of the dirge, the entire venue fell silent, filled with mournful and touching sounds. At that moment, Cai Tingkai could no longer contain his sorrow, and tears streamed down his face. Zhang Li, the brigade commander of the 121st Brigade of the 61st Division, who was standing to Cai's right, also wept alongside Cai and wiped away his tears with a handkerchief. By the end of the ceremony, tears were falling profusely. The family members of the martyrs were especially grieved. At the same time, many civilians who attended the ceremony were also moved to tears.</p>
<h3>Wreaths and Funeral Couplets Everywhere</h3>
<p>The number of funeral couplets sent by various sectors was no less than tens of thousands. Therefore, from the park entrance outside the venue to various places inside the park surrounding the venue, were covered with couplets. There were also thousands of wreaths, everywhere on and below the altar. Among them, the one sent by the Transportation Department of the 19th Army was the most unique. It was made using an unexploded 50-pound bomb dropped by a Japanese aircraft and two Type 38 rifles from war trophies as support. There were silk wreaths, wax wreaths, and so on, everything was available. Weng Zhaoyuan directing on the memorial platform, photographed by Li Zunyong.</p>
<h3>Participants Leaving Suzhou</h3>
<p>Kong Xiangxi, representing the Nationalist Government, participated in the ceremony yesterday. At 2:05 PM, he returned to Shanghai by special train, arriving at around 4:00 PM. Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, and others were on the same train. It was also reported that Ju Zheng, Li Jishen, and others were scheduled to return to Nanjing that evening.</p>
<h3>Quick Sketch of the Venue</h3>
<p>The scenery of the May 30th Park was originally quite beautiful, with pavilions and terraces, small but complete. On that day, a high altar was erected in the center of the park. Memorial tablets were placed on the altar, and the offerings were all vegetarian dishes, prepared by the entire 121st Brigade and 120th Brigade of the 61st Division. The dishes were quite unique, arranged in colorful dishes, with warning sentences reflected in the dishes, such as "[Bringing Glory to the People]", "[Raiding the Three Islands]", "[Model Soldier]", "[Eternally Loyal]". Before the sacrificial table, a flower monument was built, and the words "Grave of Fallen Soldiers" were pasted with petals. Before the sacrificial platform, there was a large wreath with the words "[Dying for the Country]", which was jointly presented by various divisions, brigades, regiments, battalions, and companies of the 19th Route Army. In the center of the altar hung a huge horizontal cloth banner of Chiang Kai-shek, on which were written the words "[Serving the Party]". On the left and right were two vertical banners, with "[Resisting Violence and Defending Against Insults]" written on the right and "[Achieving Benevolence and Taking Righteousness]" written on the left. To the left of the sacrificial platform was the seat for representatives of the Ministry of Military Affairs, and to the right were the family members of the martyrs, representatives from all sectors, and the seats for journalists from Shanghai and Nanjing. To the right of the venue were the seats for soldiers, and to the left were the seats for guests and the China Harmonica Society.</p>
<h3>Eulogy by the Central Executive Committee</h3>
<p>Eulogy of the Central Executive Committee: "On this 28th day of May in the 21st year of the Republic of China, on the occasion of our memorial service for the fallen soldiers of the Shanghai Anti-Japanese War, the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang respectfully sends representatives to offer clear wine and various dishes to the spirits of the soldiers, saying: When our party celebrates the success of the revolution and unification, striving under the Three Principles of the People, laying the world in great harmony, how could we have foreseen the clouds rolling over the White Mountains and waves overturning the Huangpu River, the rampant actions of the invaders, suddenly igniting the smoke of war in half the country? Relying on our martyrs wielding the spear of Lu Yang, acting as pillars in the middle stream, achieving benevolence and going to righteousness, truly the glory of the nation. Alas, you martyrs, your extraordinary achievements and great deeds are admired throughout the universe. Looking at the brilliant blood, may your noble spirit last forever. Alas, enjoy the sacrifice."</p>
<h3>Eulogy by the National Government</h3>
<p>Eulogy of the National Government: "On this 28th day of May in the 21st year of the Republic of China, Kong Xiangxi, representative of the National Government, respectfully offers incense and flowers to the spirits of the fallen soldiers of the Shanghai Anti-Japanese War, saying: The wind in Wu Garden is mournful, and the clouds over Suzhou Terrace are bleak. Commemorating the heroic spirits, the whole world feels sorrow. The strong enemy invades, and the national defense shakes. Defending the country and protecting the homeland, our army is brave. Resolute and fearless, they frighten the enemy early on. Charging through the enemy's mines, giant cannons fly horizontally. Attacking and deciding ten times,斩将搴旗. Forgetting themselves for the country, fighting to the death with comrades, they only know to kill the enemy, not caring about returning. Generous and heroic, they promoted our national prestige. After a hundred battles, they were not tired. Blood stained the rivers, and war bones lay across the fields. Pressing forward one after another, their heroic hearts never wavered. Although they suffered the pain of carrying corpses, their spirit of benevolence shone brightly. Their names flow with their bodies, illuminating the sky and earth. How magnificent are the national martyrs! Their merits exist in the party and the country, glorifying our Chinese ancestors. The rivers and mountains are magnificent, and the stars and sun shine brightly. It is not personal praise, but the light of the nation. Smiling in the Nine Springs, their heroic names will be remembered for thousands of years. The country has rules, and people admire loyalty and bravery. Respectfully offering condolences, the sacrifices are fragrant and pure. Cutting paper to summon souls, we contain our sorrow and shed tears. Their names are painted in history, and their deeds are carved on monuments. For thousands of years, their heroic names will never be extinguished. Alas, enjoy the sacrifice."</p>
<h3>Open Letter to the People of the Nation</h3>
<p>An open letter from the memorial service for fallen soldiers of the Shanghai Anti-Japanese War to the people of the nation said: "It has been two months since our army withdrew from the front line of the Anti-Japanese War to the second line. The Shanghai Armistice Agreement has also been signed for a long time. However, the patriotic people of our Northeast are still struggling in a bitter fight with the strong enemy. Holding the memorial service for the fallen soldiers today, looking back at the past and thinking about the present, we deeply feel anger and pain. The Japanese imperialists have already seized our three northeastern provinces by force. They sent troops to Shanghai to threaten our country, suppress our Anti-Japanese Movement, declared that they would drive our army out of Shanghai within four hours, and launched an attack on us that night. In order to fulfill our duty as soldiers to defend the country, our army resolutely fought against them. Since the beginning of the war, the enemy has successively reinforced its troops, with no less than hundreds of thousands of people. They used new-style weapons such as tanks, airplanes, artillery, and warships, and used the Public Concession as a base to launch joint attacks on us from the sea, land, and air. Our army's strength was only half of theirs, and we had no new-style weapons. Under these disparate circumstances, we knew that exhaustion was inevitable. But our soldiers were not only not afraid, but even more heroic. They fought in the face of fierce enemy fire, sparing no effort to use their flesh and blood to fight for every inch of advancement and retreat. Therefore, they were able to persist for a month, making the invaders change commanders four times without achieving their goals. All our loyal and brave soldiers deeply understood that this was a war to seek liberation for the nation, and they bravely sacrificed their precious lives. The result of this great sacrifice, on the one hand, increased the risk of collapse for the enemy country, making the great powers recognize that the Chinese nation could not be arbitrarily slaughtered, and on the other hand, aroused the spirit of resistance of our entire nation, with far-reaching effects. Since the September 18th Incident, the people of the country have sought justice from the world's great powers and entrusted the League of Nations to uphold justice, but they have shouted themselves hoarse with little effect. The current world powers each have their own self-interest, and treating us as a colony is their consistent attitude. The existence of various unequal treaties can be seen as clear evidence. The so-called League of Nations is just a coordinating body for the great powers to divide the world market. The capitalist economic structure of the great powers has developed to the highest form丨丨imperialism丨丨external expansion is their inevitable action, and the resulting conflicts are inevitable. Our country is in the midst of this global industrial panic, and all the imperialists are struggling to save their own dying fate. We must not have illusions of assistance from the great powers. We must use their conflicts to seek self-salvation and self-defense. Moreover, the sages have said [not afraid of tyranny], [rather be a broken jade than a whole tile], this kind of tough and unyielding spirit is a necessary condition for the nation to fight for survival. We firmly believe that the freedom and equality of the Chinese nation can only be obtained through resistance. Because resistance explains the truth better than any moving appeal. The reason why our fallen soldiers broke their bodies without regret is the embodiment of this strong and unyielding spirit. The bloodstains of our martyrs are the road signs for our nation's progress. Since the  Incident, the people of our country have enthusiastically rotated soldiers and given our army full assistance. The enthusiastic situation has set an unprecedented record because our army is fighting for the liberation of the nation, which meets the demands of the people. Therefore, our army does not worry about shortages and is encouraged and willing to die for the country. Our army is grateful for this. From another point of view, this kind of enthusiastic assistance is the dawn of our nation's future. This national spirit is not an accidental impulse but has a long and profound source. In the difficult process of history, the will to survive of our nation has repeatedly shown its great power to sweep away the obstacles. We firmly believe that this spirit cannot be destroyed by airplanes and artillery, and we vow to fight the invaders to the end and will surely achieve the final victory. The reason why our fallen soldiers are broken into pieces without hesitation is to practice this belief. In this battle, we deeply feel the lack of new-style weapons and the significance of sacrifice. We believe that modern warfare is increasingly mechanized, and heroic hand-to-hand combat is a thing of the past. The mechanization of war preparedness is the result of social industrialization. Therefore, in order to compete for national survival, the development of industry is necessary to save the current crisis. But if we want to develop China's industry, will we follow the old path of capitalism or the non-capitalist road? This is indeed a serious and must be solved question. We and others are because of the significance of the sacrifice of the fallen soldiers.</p>

<p>One, but think of the fundamental issue of social transformation and hope that the people of the whole country will think deeply and determine the method of its solution. Today, Japanese imperialism is massacring our volunteer army in the Northeast, and is even further occupying Yuguan. The situation is more serious than in the past. The Anti-Japanese Movement does not allow for any delay, and the most important and effective method of the Anti-Japanese Movement is to resist goods. We sincerely hope that the people of the whole country will continue to make persistent efforts and stick to the end. We sincerely make a solemn and urgent request on the day of the memorial service for the fallen soldiers. The colleagues of this meeting mourn the death of our comrades and the danger of the country, vow to avenge the martyrs and realize their legacy. We shed tears and present words, hoping for your common judgement."</p>
<h3>Open Letter to Our Officers and Soldiers</h3>
<p>An open letter from the memorial service for fallen soldiers of the Shanghai Anti-Japanese War to our officers and soldiers said: "Since the January 28th Incident, our army has fought bitterly with the violent Japanese for a month. The brutality of Japanese imperialism and the heroic sacrifices of our comrades are all facts that we have personally experienced. Today, as we pay our respects to our comrades who have achieved benevolence, we cannot help but feel grief and anger. But let us wipe away our tears, endure the pain, and make a resolution to avenge them! This time, the violent Japanese, wielding their sharp weapons, directly invaded Shanghai. Our army, in order to fulfill our duty as soldiers to defend the country, resolutely fought against them. Our army's strength was already inferior to the enemy, and we lacked new-style equipment. Under these disparate circumstances, we were able to persist for a month, making the invaders change commanders four times without achieving their goals. This was due to the heroic spirit of sacrifice of our martyrs. Our martyrs deeply understood that this was a war to seek liberation for the nation, and they did not hesitate to break their bodies in order to fulfill their sacred duty. Their great and unyielding spirit will forever exist in the center of our nation and will be a model for us. As a result of the sacrifices of our many comrades, on the one hand, the internal crises of the enemy country increased, and the imperialists recognized that the Chinese nation could not be arbitrarily slaughtered, and on the other hand, the spirit of resistance of our entire nation was aroused, with far-reaching effects. We, who survived, should be more inspired to realize their legacy and restore our nation. This battle has won the universal support and assistance of the people of the country. Recalling the painful experiences of past internal strife is chilling. Internal strife that violates the will of the people is enough to bring about the tragic fate of national subjugation. The blood shed by our martyrs for the nation has shown us the right path of struggle. This is what we should never forget. Today, the atmosphere of aggression is growing in the Northeast, and the international situation is urgent. In order to seek liberation for the nation and avenge our ancestors, we should be more inspired, vow not to yield, and strive for final victory. The spirits of the martyrs will serve as our role model."</p>

<h3>The Future of the Round Table Conference</h3>
<p>— Remarks from a Certain Important Figure in the National Government</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain important figure in the National Government stated that the Japanese propaganda regarding the round table conference is purely for show. Although the Japanese side is eager to convene this conference, it will be difficult to proceed independently without China's consent to participate. Even countries such as Britain and the United States are unwilling to participate in any international conference related to China without China's consent. This is evident in the statements made by British Under-Secretary of State Eden on the 26th and the US State Department on the 27th. In terms of the round table conference itself, if the scope of discussion is limited to the Shanghai security issue, then there is absolutely no need to convene it. Shanghai's security was never an issue before January 28th. The problem arose entirely due to the Japanese military's atrocities. The responsibility should be borne by the Japanese side. Currently, Shanghai's security can be restored to its original state as soon as the Japanese troops completely withdraw. There is no need for discussion. As for the absurd proposals to change Shanghai's status and establish a so-called free city of Shanghai, they are purely one-sided propaganda. Not only are Britain and the United States, which respect the League of Nations Covenant and the Nine-Power Treaty, unwilling to discuss them, but the Japanese government would not openly propose them either. In short, we believe that if an international conference must be convened, it must be based on the spirit of the League of Nations Covenant, the League of Nations resolutions, and the Nine-Power Treaty, and the entire Sino-Japanese issue, including the entire Northeast Incident, must be discussed. Otherwise, the Chinese government will find it difficult to agree to participate. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Movement to Convene Round Table Conference</h3>
<p>Colluding with Certain Forces in Shanghai to Coerce China</p>
<p>Japan Advocates that the Scope of the Conference Not Involve the Manchurian Issue</p>
<p>Britain, the United States, France, and Italy Discuss and Consider the Time Not Ripe</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 28th - According to a dispatch from the Washington correspondent of the Daily Telegraph, Prime Minister MacDonald spoke with US Secretary of State Stimson via long-distance telephone across the Atlantic yesterday. The content concerned the Japanese proposal to convene a round table conference of the powers in Shanghai. This matter has been stalled due to the assassination of Inukai Tsuyoshi. It is said that Prime Minister MacDonald suddenly decided that this matter should be handled with caution. After the conversation between Stimson and MacDonald yesterday, it is said that it is considered that the time to convene this conference is not ripe.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 28th - After informal talks with the United States, Britain, France, and Italy, it was stated that the United States could participate in an international conference on Chinese affairs if China was invited to attend.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 27th - It was learned from the US State Department today that the diplomatic representatives of the United States, Britain, France, and Italy are currently engaged in informal talks to agree on a policy to deal with the Japanese proposal to convene a round table conference. However, it is said that this is still a preliminary contact, only inquiring about opinions and has not yet entered into a formal discussion period. All parties are now paying special attention to the scope of the conference. It is said that Japan intends to limit it to the Shanghai issue only, while other countries believe that the entire issue of Sino-Japanese relations, including Manchuria, should be put up for discussion.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 27th - It was further learned today that after contacting the diplomatic representatives of the United States, Britain, France, and Italy regarding the Japanese proposal to convene a round table conference, it was considered that the time for the conference was not yet ripe, but it was hoped that the tense situation between China and Japan could be sufficiently eased soon so that this conference could be guaranteed to succeed. At that time, the United States and Britain may be the first to accept the Japanese proposal.</p>
<p>World News Agency Translation: According to the Millard's Review, there is a strange point about the Shanghai Round Table Conference. According to the English version of the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun, Foreign Minister Yoshizawa invited the ambassadors of the United States, Britain, France, and Italy in Tokyo on the 13th of this month to propose holding an international round table conference on the Shanghai issue in Shanghai. If China refuses to hold it, then it will be held in Tokyo, and then the four countries involved will force the Nanjing government to accept the resolution of the conference. On the same day, Mr. Wu Dehai, chairman of the British Overseas Chinese Association in Shanghai, convened a board meeting of the association and proposed that the foreign chambers of commerce pass a resolution to support holding this round table conference. The next day (14th), Wu Dehai sent his [confidential] proposal to the chambers of commerce. The proposals of the Japanese Foreign Minister and Wu Dehai came on the same day. What a coincidence! Although it may be due to accidental coincidence, judging from various forms, there seems to be a cooperative relationship between them. In other words, Mr. Wu Dehai may have received a secret message from Tokyo (probably from British Ambassador Sir Miles Lampson) stating that the Japanese government has decided to invite the powers to participate in this conference and at the same time threaten China that if China does not agree to convene this conference, it will be held in Tokyo, and then [persuade] China to accept the results of the conference. Even more noteworthy, the sudden decision of the Japanese Army Ministry to withdraw all Japanese troops from Shanghai seems to have been made on May 12, which is one day before the joint proposal of Yoshizawa and Wu Dehai for the round table conference. The full truth of Japan's decision to attack Shanghai and its decision to withdraw troops is unknown, but judging from the official and unofficial reports published in the newspapers, there seems to be a kind of cooperation between the Japanese military authorities and certain interests in Shanghai. For example, in Wu Dehai's letter to the various chambers of commerce, he stated, "[Unless effective action is taken immediately, Shanghai may soon face the same problems that had to be dealt with before January 28]." Anyone who understands the situation in Shanghai for many months should know that the so-called Shanghai issues, such as the roads outside the concession, the Chinese garrison, and the provisional court, were no more urgent on January 28 than in the previous months or even years. Only the Japanese felt they were urgent. The Japanese felt they were urgent because the Chinese anti-Japanese movement had a great impact on Japan's occupation of Manchuria. Although the Japanese officially declared that their interference in Shanghai was for the sake of [protecting] Japanese residents, knowledgeable people know that its purpose is closely related to the Manchurian situation. What is not known is whether the Japanese military's decision to invade Shanghai had obtained the consent of certain powerful interests in Shanghai. When Japan decided to withdraw its troops, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs claimed, "[Japan is actually fighting for other countries in Shanghai and only earns the world's criticism]." This statement is worth pondering. Moreover, after the Shanghai war broke out, rumors spread in Shanghai that someone was secretly promoting international league support to establish a Shanghai free city. The Dongbao reported that the resolution sent to Geneva was signed by 29 people. This is also a sign of cooperation between the Japanese and certain Shanghai interests.</p>
<h3>Various Countries Pay Attention</h3>
<h3>Japanese Cabinet's Political Measures</h3>
<p>Diplomacy Towards China Will Become More Assertive Under Military Control, Russo-Japanese Conflict May Be Avoided ▲ Tokyo Dispatch, 28th, Far East News Agency: Since the formation of the Saito Cabinet, various countries and their respective societies have paid close attention. Far East and Japan experts in British official circles say, "The new Saito Cabinet is a cabinet that bridges the gap between Japanese national essence faction (fascists) and political party factions." In the future, it will inevitably adopt a more assertive policy on China issues than the purely Seiyukai cabinet. Compared with the powerful cabinets of Hiranuma and Ugaki, it will pay more attention to the trend of international situations. It is expected to adopt a slightly national socialist color on domestic affairs and economic issues. The selection of the new foreign minister and finance minister has become the focus of attention in British official circles. It is also said that although the new Saito cabinet is nominally an intermediate cabinet, the power within the cabinet is dominated by the military. Therefore, it is no different from a military government. American official circles say, "When Prime Minister Saito was the Governor-General of Korea, he implemented good colonial policies and demonstrated superb diplomatic skills at the Anglo-American-Japanese naval disarmament conference." Therefore, if he can handle the Manchuria issue, which urgently needs to be resolved in the future, with prudence, he will not disappoint various countries. German official circles are paying close attention to the appointments of the Army and Navy Ministers and the Foreign Minister in the new cabinet. However, no matter which faction's cabinet comes to power, the de facto "Manchukuo" is already in Japanese hands, and it is expected that there will be no major changes in the policy towards Manchuria. The new cabinet will do its utmost to avoid the crisis of conflict with Soviet Russia.</p>
<h3>Matsudaira's Remarks to Foreign Reporters</h3>
<p>Reuters, 28th, London: Japanese Ambassador to London, Matsudaira, told a certain European journalist that the fantasy of a Russo-Japanese war was created by overly sensitive pessimists. The interview was published today in the Manchester Guardian. The interviewer specifically asked the ambassador why Russia said that Japan was using a large army to protect a small number of Japanese residents, and whether Russia had accused Japan of supporting the White Russians. Why did Japan refuse to conclude a non-aggression pact with Russia? Matsudaira replied that the number of Japanese troops was not determined by the number of Japanese residents, but by the number of bandits. Everyone knows that the power of the White Russians and the revolution is weak, so how can they be relied upon for assistance? Moreover, Japan is now busy resolving the situation in northern Manchuria and does not seem to want to invade Russia and increase its difficulties. This kind of inaccurate speculation must have been caused by the speech given by Army Minister Araki in Osaka on April 22. At that time, the army warned the League of Nations and Soviet Russia not to interfere in the Manchuria incident and announced that Japan firmly opposed applying the Nine-Power Treaty to the Manchuria case. As for Japan's refusal to conclude a new treaty with Soviet Russia, this kind of new treaty is prone to misunderstanding. Since there is already the Kellogg-Briand Pact with the same purpose, why bother with another one? The interviewer then asked how the assassination of Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi had affected Japan's foreign policy, especially its policy towards Manchuria. The ambassador replied that it was not possible to make a definite judgment at the moment and predicted that there would be no major changes. He also said that there was at least no need to worry that military fascism would control Japan's foreign policy or tend towards aggression against Russia.</p>
<h3>Saionji Dissatisfied with the New Cabinet</h3>
<p>Tokyo Dispatch, 28th, Far East News Agency: Saionji left Tokyo for Okitsu at 1 p.m. today after the organization of the new cabinet was completed. However, Saionji is still not completely satisfied with the new cabinet because most of the well-known politicians in the country, such as Wakatsuki, the president of the Minseito Party, and Suzuki, the president of the Seiyukai Party, have not joined the cabinet.</p>
<h3>Uchida Will Return Home to Serve as Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>Dalian Dispatch, 28th, Far East News Agency: Saito made every effort to urge Uchida, the president of South Manchuria Railway, to serve as Foreign Minister in this cabinet. Uchida once declined, but Saito believed that Uchida had popularity in the military and was trusted by the elder statesman Saionji, so he repeatedly sent people to persuade him. It is said that Uchida plans to leave Manchuria for Tokyo on June 8, taking his family back to the country, and all his furniture will also be taken back. It is expected here that Uchida's position as Foreign Minister may be realized.</p>
<h3>Provisional Diet Session Schedule</h3>
<p>Both Political Parties Decide on Countermeasures ▲ Tokyo Dispatch, 28th, Electric News Agency: The agenda of the provisional Diet session was decided today as follows: (1) The Imperial Rescript for the opening ceremony will be published in the official gazette on May 30. (2) The opening ceremony will be held at 10 a.m. on June 2. (3) On the 2nd, the chairpersons of all committees and the chairpersons of each standing committee will be elected. (4) On the 3rd, the Prime Minister will give a policy speech, the Minister of Finance will give a speech on financial policy, and the Foreign Minister will give a speech on foreign policy. (5) The closing ceremony will be held on the 15th. ▲ Tokyo Dispatch, 28th, Japan Allied News: At the beginning of the meetings of the House of Peers and the House of Representatives, Prime Minister Saito will give a policy speech on the new cabinet. The content will focus on stabilizing people's hearts, implementing social policies, relieving rural and fishing villages, strengthening national defense, and controlling the national army. At the same time, he will declare an active policy towards Manchuria and the renewal of imperial diplomacy. As for financial and economic issues, Finance Minister Takahashi will give a speech on the established policy of the Seiyukai. In addition, regarding the management of exchange and the reform of tariffs, he will announce three major reform economic measures. The Seiyukai plans not to question the Minister of Finance's speech, but on the Prime Minister's policy speech, it plans to raise some questions from the Seiyukai's own standpoint. The Minseito Party has decided to avoid provocative questions, but on Finance Minister Takahashi's financial speech, it will raise questions from the standpoint of the Minseito Party's traditional policies. The final decision will be made by the floor leaders of both parties.</p>

<h3>World Monetary Conference</h3>
<p>— Britain and the United States Express Approval</p>
<p>Paris Dispatch, 28th, Reuters: The plan for the World Monetary Conference has been approved by Britain and the United States and is now underway in France.

<h3>Disarmament Naval Committee Passes</h3>
<h3>Experts' Vague Report</h3>
<p>No Substantial Decision on the Offensive and Defensive Nature of War Materiel ▲ London Dispatch, 27th, Reuters: The Naval Committee of the Disarmament Conference today passed the report of the Committee of Experts. The Committee of Experts recently discussed which war materials were most offensive, most easily destructive to national defense, or most dangerous to civilians. However, its report did not contain any resolutions and only listed the different views of various countries on battleships, aircraft carriers, and submarines. This report will be submitted to the General Affairs Committee, but the date of the General Affairs Committee meeting has not been set. According to a Geneva report, before the meeting, the government leaders of various European countries may first discuss with the US representative, Gibson, to seek agreement. For the sake of convenience, this discussion will be held a few days before the Lausanne Conference. The Aviation Committee also had a meeting today, but so far it has not been decided which air war materials are offensive in nature. The Belgian representative suggested that all aircraft that can drop bombs, or weigh more than 1,500 kilograms, or have engines with more than 550 horsepower, should be considered war materials of an offensive nature. ▲ Geneva Dispatch, 27th, Reuters: Belgian representative Brooke, chairman of the Aviation Committee of the Disarmament Conference, urged the Disarmament Conference to quickly decide which aerial war materials are offensive in nature and which are defensive in nature. The committee has discussed aerial war materials for a long time, but has not yet made a substantial decision on which war materials are offensive. Therefore, the chairman adjourned the meeting today and postponed it to Tuesday for resumption, so that the representatives could re-discuss this issue and submit a unanimous report to the General Affairs Committee of the Disarmament Conference. When adjourning the meeting, the chairman issued a warning to the representatives, saying, "Gentlemen, take responsibility and produce substantial results. If this vagueness continues, it will have a tragic impact on the general public."</p>
<h3>Germany Conducts Exercise</h3>
<h3>Defending Against Air Raids</h3>
<p>Wilhelmshaven Dispatch, 27th, Havas: An aerial aircraft attack exercise was held here recently. The residents were very interested in this matter. This exercise is to test how to defend against aerial attacks, and it also allows us to understand what to do in the unfortunate event of war. During the exercise, an alarm was first sounded. A long, sharp bell rang from the arsenal to warn the staff that enemy aircraft were 50 kilometers away and flying towards the city. Therefore, the defense team leader immediately issued an order to a special team. Soon, some people with tools in their hands and gas masks tied around their chests came forward, followed by nurses, firefighters, engineers, etc. At that time, work in the factory continued as usual. It was not until the second bell rang, reporting that the enemy aircraft had arrived, that work stopped. Therefore, all personnel rushed to the shelters to prevent the attack of enemy aircraft. The doors of the shelters were tightly closed and airtight. Some nurses wore rubber clothes to rescue those who arrived, and chemical drugs were sprayed around to slightly kill the effectiveness of the poison gas. Workers wearing gas masks used automatic air pumps to try to eliminate the poison gas so that it would not cause harm. On the command platform, there was a general map with lights that flashed on and off, reporting that aircraft had been fired at or that enemy aircraft had dropped bombs. The person in charge of the command platform used a telephone to transmit orders to deal with various situations as the situation changed. When the danger was at its highest, a siren sounded to warn the public. When the danger had passed, other signals were issued, and the exercise ended.</p>
<h3>Remaining US Warships in the Atlantic</h3>
<h3>Transferred to the Pacific to Participate in Maneuvers</h3>
<p>Washington Dispatch, 27th, National News Agency: Today, the US Navy Department ordered the remaining ships of the Atlantic Patrol Fleet that had completed their annual repairs to sail to the Pacific to join the maneuvers. These include the Marblehead, Gilchrist, Tattnall, DuPont, and the aircraft carrier Lexington. Not long ago, the US Navy Department ordered the Atlantic Patrol Fleet to remain in the Pacific temporarily after the maneuvers were completed. Now, the remaining ships are being transferred. This has aroused much speculation from the outside world.</p>
<h3>Romania Brews Cabinet Upheaval</h3>
<p>French Interference in Romanian Finances, National Socialist Party Seizes Opportunity to Act ▲ Bucharest Dispatch, 27th, National News Agency: The Romanian political situation is about to trigger a cabinet upheaval due to the report of French economic expert Rist. The French expert's report severely criticizes the impropriety of Romania's economic and financial policies, and the language is extremely direct. Today, the French Minister directly sent it to the Romanian Minister of Finance, which is slightly different from the usual procedures, indicating the French dissatisfaction with the current situation in Romania. Therefore, the political circles are quite shaken. It is predicted that the Romanian cabinet will resign within the next few days. However, there is also something particularly noteworthy: before this report was published this morning, the newly formed Romanian National Socialist Party issued a political program, demanding that Romania's financial policy be freed from French interference, the cancellation of all foreign debts, and the improvement of the national military organization so that it could resist communism.</p>
<h3>Berlin Communists Demonstrate Against Japan</h3>
<p>Berlin Dispatch, 28th, Havas: Last night, communists again held an anti-Japanese demonstration in front of the Japanese hotel and threw stones wrapped in leaflets through the windows.

<h3>He Jian Seals Off</h3>
<h3>Student Anti-Japanese Association</h3>
<p>Business Community Refuses Student Inspection of Goods ▲ He Jian Stops Student Actions ▲ Students Ultimately Completely Succumb Changsha Correspondence: The Hunan anti-Japanese organizations originally took the Hunan People's Anti-Japanese Association as the hub. In addition, student anti-Japanese associations, worker anti-Japanese associations, teacher and staff anti-Japanese associations, etc., were all under the command and supervision of the Hunan People's Anti-Japanese Association to carry out all work. The provincial party headquarters of the Kuomintang and the entire committee of the provincial government jointly formed the Supreme Cadre Meeting as the highest body for guiding the anti-Japanese movement. It can be seen that the anti-Japanese work in Hunan is centered on the party and government authorities. However, the Supreme Cadre conducted two general inspections of enemy goods. The first inspection was registration. All enemy goods were stamped with a stamp and charged a registration fee of 5%, but they were still allowed to be sold. The second inspection was a supplementary inspection. All enemy goods that were not registered in the previous inspection were required to pay the fee for registration and were fined 30,000 yuan, which was collected by the chamber of commerce as a punishment. Recently, the Student Anti-Japanese Association felt that it could not thoroughly eliminate enemy goods and decided to conduct a general door-to-door inspection on the 26th and 27th of this month. It planned to seal up all the enemy goods that had been registered and stamped and were not allowed to be sold again. All enemy goods that had not been stamped would be confiscated and burned. Five students formed a team, and 800 teams were organized, totaling 4,000 people. Starting at 8 a.m. on the 26th, they were mobilized to inspect the streets. The merchants in Changsha City heard the news in advance and requested the Supreme Cadre and the Hunan People's Anti-Japanese Association to order the students not to seal up the enemy goods that had been registered, stamped, and fined, because they were related to the capital. They should still be allowed to be sold. The enemy goods that had not been registered and stamped would be allowed to be confiscated by the students. The party and government authorities held a Supreme Cadre meeting on the 24th to discuss the matter. They believed that the merchants' request was justified and decided as follows: (1) Merchants are allowed to open up a separate area for their existing enemy goods this month. (2) The Hunan People's Anti-Japanese Association will formulate detailed inspection methods and preside over the handling of the matter after June 1 (without prior announcement of the date). (3) The enemy goods that have not been stamped will be confiscated. The enemy goods in the stamped area will still be allowed to be sold, but the People's Anti-Japanese Association will inspect the enemy goods in the area at any time and only allow them to be reduced. (4) The Student Anti-Japanese Association should accept orders from higher authorities and not act alone before the People's Anti-Japanese Association has formulated the general inspection method. He Jian also summoned the principals of public and private schools to the Department of Education at 3 p.m. on the 24th to give a lecture, ordering them to restrain the students from taking any out-of-line actions, otherwise, only the principals would be questioned. Unexpectedly, the Student Anti-Japanese Association did not accept the decision of the Supreme Cadre and insisted on carrying out the general inspection on the 26th. The merchants also held an emergency meeting to decide on several matters: (1) Organize 500 merchant self-defense teams, with 50 people in each team. Each person will carry a carrying pole or a wooden stick. The expenses will be borne by each industry. They will use force to prevent students from inspecting and strive for self-defense. (2) On the day the students go to the streets to inspect the goods, all businesses will go on strike. The merchant self-defense teams will be deployed in various districts to guard the entrances of the shops to prepare for conflict. (3) Report to the military and police agencies and request them to protect the merchants and stop the students from acting freely. By the 25th, the situation had gradually become tense. He Jian sent Liu Wonan, a member of the Changsha City Party Department, in the afternoon to summon the persons in charge of the student self-governing associations of various schools to persuade them to accept the methods set by the Supreme Cadre. However, the students were still determined not to comply. Therefore, 5,000 members of the merchant self-defense team decided to go to the streets for self-defense at dawn on the 26th. He Jian took decisive action and ordered Hu Da, the commander of the provincial capital garrison, and Peng Zhuo, the director of the provincial capital public security bureau, to immediately send troops and police to seal off the Student Anti-Japanese Association at 12 p.m. on the 25th. He also announced a temporary emergency curfew for three days, assigning troops to guard the entrances of various schools. On the 26th and 27th, students were prohibited from leaving the school. At the same time, an order was issued to the Department of Education to instruct the principals of various schools to strictly prohibit students from leaving the school to participate in the inspection of goods. The military and police agencies and the personnel of the Department of Education carried out the order that night, which was extremely busy all night long. By the morning of the 26th, the city was densely packed with military and police personnel, and military and police personnel were also stationed in various schools. The students were unable to go out, and the merchant self-defense team did not go to the streets after hearing the news. Therefore, no conflict occurred. Hu Da, the commander of the provincial capital garrison, and Peng Zhuo, the director of the public security bureau, sent letters to the principals of various schools regarding this case, and the Department of Education also sent orders to the principals of various schools. The original text is as follows: (1) Hu Peng's letter to the principals of various schools reads, "[In the case reported by Chairman and Commander-in-Chief He, the Student Anti-Japanese and National Salvation Association of this city has not complied with the orders of the Hunan People's Anti-Japanese and National Salvation Association and the resolution of the Supreme Cadre Meeting, and has organized 800 inspection teams, insisting on going to the city on the 26th to conduct a door-to-door general inspection, sealing up all the enemy goods that the merchants have paid for and registered, repeatedly guiding them to no avail, and the merchants are also prepared to resist for the sake of self-defense. Checking the anti-Japanese and national salvation is the common enthusiasm of the people of the country, but the actions should follow the rules and not pretend to be patriotic and secretly disrupt the reality. There are records of repeated orders from the Central Government, and the Student Anti-Japanese Association has no party discipline or law and order, and takes free action. If precautions are not taken in advance, once a major change occurs, who will be responsible? This department is responsible for maintaining public security, and it is required to strictly stop it immediately. If there is resistance or other out-of-line action, the Student Anti-Japanese and National Salvation Association will be sealed off and the main culprits will be arrested and punished to maintain law and order and ensure security. The handling of the matter should still be reported as necessary. This order, etc., is followed. Check the student anti-Japanese movement, which is a patriotic enthusiasm, but the actions must follow the right track to gain the people's belief. If you do not abide by the legal system, do not obey the instructions of the superiors, and act freely, it is a violation of the party discipline and law and order, which is not what intellectuals should do. This department is for the sake of cherishing young students. For the general inspection of enemy goods by students, we will guide and strictly stop them in accordance with the order. Your principal is responsible for education, and you will not be behind others in caring for students. Please ask your principal to stop all students from going to school tomorrow. If you allow students to go out, which leads to an accident, this department will have to ask your principal to take full responsibility for the sake of maintaining the public security of the entire city.]" (2) The order of the Department of Education to the principals of various schools reads, "[In the case reported by Chairman and Commander-in-Chief He, the Student Anti-Japanese and National Salvation Association of this city has not complied with the orders of the superiors and has taken free action, calling on all the students in the city to go to the city to conduct door-to-door inspections, pretending to be patriotic and secretly disrupting the reality, and has reached the point of disregarding party discipline and law and order. The Chairman and Commander-in-Chief, for the sake of maintaining public security, has ordered the Provincial Capital Garrison Command to seal it off together with the Public Security Bureau and declared a temporary curfew to curb the chaos. Students from various schools have a patriotic enthusiasm, and their actions should follow the right track. They should not echo the chaotic orders of the Student Anti-Japanese and National Salvation Association of this city. The principals of various schools are responsible for managing students and should immediately give strict instructions to prevent them from participating in illegal actions, which will violate the original intention of patriotism. In addition to sending it to various departments, the director of the department is ordered to immediately instruct the principals of the schools under his jurisdiction to strictly comply, without any slack. If students from a certain school participate in the above-mentioned out-of-line actions, the principal of the school will be held accountable, absolutely! This order, etc., should be strictly complied with by the principal of the school, and there should be no slackness.]" (May 26)</p>

<h3>Trade Associations Form Federation</h3>
<p>— Agency for Opposing Increased Business Tax</p>
<p>Chairmen, members, and standing committee members of various trade associations in Hangzhou held a joint meeting at the city chamber of commerce on the afternoon of the 27th, with more than 100 people attending. Xu Xinggong was elected as chairman. First, the chairman reported that the various industries had submitted petitions to the provincial government, the finance department, the industrial department of the executive yuan of the national government, and the finance department, requesting that the business tax rate in Zhejiang Province be maintained and the newly revised tax rate of 10 per mille be abolished. The passing situation was not approved. Then, the coping methods were discussed and decided. (1) The Federation of Trade Associations of Various Industries in Hangzhou City will be organized immediately. The chairmen and members of various trade associations will be ex-officio members, and standing committee members will be separately appointed. (2) This time, the provincial government has illegally revised the business tax rate, and merchants vow not to recognize it. Before the purpose of requesting cancellation is achieved, all shops in various industries will temporarily postpone the payment of business tax. If the tax bureau forcibly implements the matter, it must immediately report to the respective trade association and quickly report to the federation to jointly plan the final effective specific measures. (3) For the above measures, all industries must uniformly comply with them. Before receiving the notification from the federation, no industry may pay the business tax alone. (4) The above resolution will be published in the newspaper in the name of the Federation of Trade Associations of Various Industries in Hangzhou City, and the first committee meeting will be held on the 30th to elect standing committee members and the chairman to facilitate the process.

<p>Red Cross Asks to Waive Rent Zhou Xuewen, Director of the Songjiang Branch of the Red Cross Society of China, sent a telegram to Gu, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government: "Songjiang is located at the crossroads of the Shanghai-Hangzhou line. Since the year of Jiazi, wars and disasters have followed one after another, causing deep wounds and suffering, which have not yet recovered. Last winter, the Japanese soldiers invaded the territory, and the Shanghai-Songjiang war was fought. The social economy of Songjiang was panicked to the extreme. In addition, the collapse of the Songjiang Bank gave the people of Songjiang a great trauma. This time, the collection of rent, the public tried their best to pay for one month, the momentum has been equal to the mosquito negative, is really difficult to continue. Moreover, this time when collecting rent, because the rich families are mostly evacuated to avoid disaster, they can get away with it. The poor are charged on a household basis, and it is difficult to get a waiver. The uneven burden of the poor and the rich is even more dissatisfied by local people. It is now heard that Qingpu, Shanghai and neighboring counties have been exempted separately. In order to raise funds, I beg you to take care of the difficulties of the people, whether it is possible to collect the rent for the second month, and treat the neighboring counties equally, and exempt from collection, so as to leave a little vitality for the place, and you will not be able to do so. You can only re-verify and estimate the insufficient number of wealthy gentry households and make up for the corresponding rent amount, and give general exemptions to the general poor residents, so as to relieve the people and avoid the disadvantages of unevenness. In addition to sending it to the Department of Civil Affairs and the Department of Finance, this is submitted."</p>
<h3>Taicang</h3>
<p>Huchuan Bridge Robbery Injures People Robberies have been rampant in the four townships of the county recently, and robberies have occurred frequently. On the evening of the other day, the home of Yang Songting, a resident of the fourth village of the twelfth village near Huchuan Bridge, was suddenly attacked by more than ten robbers. Two robbers were carrying long guns and one robber was carrying a box cannon. Yang Songting was tied up with a rope and scorched with foreign candles on the abdomen and back to extort money. 2,500 yuan in cash was robbed. The case has been reported to the county for arrest.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>An Extraordinary Murder Case in Xin'an Township</p>
<p>In the 14th District (i.e., Xin'an Township), near Xu She Town, Tu 272, the villager Zhou Jinrong operated a small blacksmith shop in Shanghai. The business was doing fairly well, enough to cover expenses. His wife, née Xu, spent most of her time in Shanghai. Three days ago, she returned from Shanghai to Wuxi to manage silkworm matters and stayed at their home on Fei Xiang. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning, neighbors had already opened their doors to prepare breakfast, but the Xu residence's main door remained tightly closed. Around eight o'clock, the neighbors became suspicious and forced the door open. They found Mrs. Xu was not at home, so they went to their lower bank house to check. Suddenly, they found Mrs. Xu lying on the rice straw in her undergarments, her face pale. She was already dead. There was a knife-like wound on her left groin, but her abdomen was not stained with blood, which was highly suspicious. There were no other unusual signs near the body, and no blood on the rice straw, indicating the body had definitely been moved. The neighbors reported it to the nearby Tu Zheng, Xu Fu'an. After receiving the report, the Tu Zheng went to the scene for a brief inspection. Since the corpse's family was not at home, he immediately went to the city to report to the County Court Procuratorate and request them to send someone for an inquest. At five o'clock in the afternoon, after Judge Du held court, he ordered them to return and stated that he would lead the police to the village for an inquest at eight o'clock this morning to arrest the murderer and bring them to justice.</p>
<p>Solutions for Rescuing the Cocoon Market</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of rescuing the silkworm districts in Jiangsu Province, the directors of the various departments of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, along with He Yushu, the director of the Department of Industry, invited local authorities and representatives from the silver, money, silk, and cocoon industries to Wuxi to discuss rescue measures. It was decided to bake fresh cocoons for the farmers, with half of the baking costs subsidized by the provincial treasury and half by local fundraising. However, due to the provincial treasury's financial difficulties, the provincial government decided to allocate 500,000 yuan in抵借券 (loan-secured vouchers) to borrow cash from Shanghai banks to rescue the Jiangsu cocoon market. It has now been learned that the Departments of Finance and Industry have contacted Zhang Gongquan from the Shanghai banking community regarding this matter and have made considerable progress. The allocation of 抵借券 (loan-secured vouchers) should be based on the amount of cocoon production in each county. The voucher amounts should be negotiated by local authorities and chambers of commerce with local banks for cash loans, with 160,000 yuan allocated to Wuxi, 80,000 yuan to Wujin, 60,000 yuan to Liyang, 40,000 yuan to Jiangyin, 30,000 yuan to Yixing, 20,000 yuan to Wuxian, 20,000 yuan to Wujiang, 10,000 yuan to Danyang, and 80,000 yuan to other counties. In addition to dispatching Yi Tingjian and Liu Shichen from the Departments of Finance and Industry with vouchers to Wuxi for negotiations, simultaneous orders have been sent to all counties to comply and proceed.</p>

<p>County Magistrate Zhang of Wu ordered the detective team leaders Ni Gusheng and Xu Shaoyun to conduct a strict investigation and arrest regarding the robbery cases that occurred in the homes of Xu Tongheng and others in the northern townships. The team leaders learned that bandits were hiding at No. 9 Minsheng Lane, Malu, Wuxi, and went to arrest Sun Shuangda, Chen Jinhai, Zhou Jingen, Ni Ashun, Yan Afang, and four others. It is reported that they have confessed to the crime and will be sent to Changzhou for trial in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Rugao</h3>
<p>Bandits Arrive, Father Dies, Son Injured</p>
<p>At the home of a Zhou family in Shenjiazhai, Lugang District, Rugao, sixteen bandits broke in over the stars on the night before yesterday. When Zhou's son heard the noise, he got up, put on his clothes, and walked into the courtyard. A bandit immediately shouted at him to be quiet and demanded to know where the silver was hidden. The son said there was not a penny in the house. The bandit was furious and immediately fired a box gun at his chest. The bullet exited from under his shoulder, and blood flowed like a waterfall. Mr. Zhou was in the room and heard the gunshot, knowing something was wrong. He was about to go out and beg for mercy when the bandits had already traced him. Without asking why, they shot and killed him. At that time, his son immediately fled from the courtyard to the back. Unexpectedly, as soon as he reached the back door, another bandit with a wooden stick struck his head, breaking his skull. He ran in pain to report to the Benjiazhuang security team. By the time the team arrived, the bandits were long gone.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Poverty and Illness Combine, Tragic Suicide by Hanging</p>
<p>On the morning of the 23rd, a man was found hanging from a big tree at the end of Dameijia Lane in the old city. People gathered and identified him as Chen Jinian (43 years old), a grass shed dweller who used to be a rickshaw puller. Amidst the commotion, Chen's wife wailed from the shed, crying that she had five children, had been suffering from a diaphragmatic disease last year that would not heal, and had been starving all day this spring due to the famine. She had been thinking of committing suicide, but did not expect this tragic change. Nearby philanthropists have already collected donations for a coffin and burial.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>A Small Abductee Found in a Wheat Field</p>
<p>When the county government bailiff Wang Shiyan was returning to the city from official business in the countryside, he heard a child crying in a wheat field east of Shuanggou. He immediately went forward, picked up the child, and asked the nearby residents whose child it was. All the residents said they did not know. Officer Wang then took the child to the city, intending to send it to the county government for claiming. When he arrived outside the north gate, he was spotted by the child's father, Zhou Hongchan, who recognized him and claimed him from Officer Wang, saying that he had been kidnapped by bandits in February and the county government had a record of it. Officer Wang then sent him and the child to the county government. After the judge examined and clarified the matter, confirming that he was indeed Zhou's young son, he was allowed to take him home.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Robbery and Murder Case on Jiao Li Street</p>
<p>In a hut in Jiaxing East City, Jiao Li Street, behind the Minfeng Paper Mill, at the home of a Wenzhou resident named Zhang Shoufu, on the evening of the 24th around 8 p.m., four people wearing gray military uniforms and holding bayonets broke in, demanding money from Zhang and threatening him with knives. As a result, Shoufu was stabbed in the thigh, and Zhang's nine-year-old son, Zhiqin, was brutally strangled to death. 120 small洋 (foreign dollars) and two角 (cents) in 角票 (small denomination paper money) were robbed. On the 25th, military officials from Heyi went to the scene to investigate and inquire about the circumstances of the robbery. Li Mo'an, the commander of the 10th Division, in addition to ordering his troops to secretly arrest the bandits, also pitied Zhang's poverty and gave him 200 yuan in relief. On the morning of the 27th, Zhang Shoufu went to the city on business and passed the Pinghu ferry terminal, where he saw two soldiers who had committed the robbery in a teahouse. He went forward to arrest them but was pushed to the ground. The two soldiers escaped. Later, a adjutant from the 57th regiment of the 10th Division passed by and ordered the sentries of the 56th regiment of the 10th Division along the route to round up the soldiers, capturing one soldier. He was sent to the 10th Division Headquarters, where Li Tuanfu, Chief Adjutant, Wang Kan, and Military Judge Xu Zhenqiu jointly interrogated him. After the victim testified that he was indeed the perpetrator of the robbery, he was questioned for two hours. According to his confession, he was Liu Jintang, a sergeant platoon leader under the 口口团特務排 (special service platoon of an independent unit) (not a soldier of the 10th Division), who had visited Zhang's place once before. He consistently denied involvement in the robbery and murder, so the interrogation has not yet concluded.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Bandit Den Smashed on Xinma Road</p>
<p>Multiple bandits were hiding in small houses at No. 126 and No. 127 Xinma Road, Jiangbei, Ningbo. The detective team learned of this and sent six armed detectives to search the area at 2 p.m. yesterday. They arrested the landlord, Mao Xinliang, and eight male and female bandits, including Wang Zhangfa, on the spot, and seized two pistols, one wooden-holster pistol, and twelve bullets, taking them all back to the team for interrogation.</p>

<p>On the 26th, the Ministry of Education promulgated 13 articles of the Provisional Regulations for Joint Graduation Examinations for Primary and Secondary School Students by ministerial order.

<h3>Fisheries School to Move Back to Wusong</h3>
<p>The location of the Jiangsu Provincial Fisheries School is at the Baotaiwan Fort in Wusong. Since the outbreak of the war, the school principal, Mr. Feng Limin, in order to ensure the students' studies, has temporarily rented the Chunjiang Villa on Kangnaituo Road as a temporary school building. Now that the Japanese army has withdrawn, Principal Feng went to the school for inspection the other day. Apart from the loss of valuable instruments and objects and the total destruction of the student dormitory by bombing, the remaining losses were light. Now he is hiring workers to repair and renovate, and will move back to class at the beginning of next month.</p>
<p>11. I cannot hold a meeting without informing Zhang Huzi. It would only be fair to wake him up so that he can participate. However, if he volunteers himself to everyone, I must stand up and object. This will inevitably lead to displeasure on both sides and resentment. I am seeking welfare for the public, so I am not afraid of hard work or complaints. However, if I can reduce a bit of resentment, there will be less resistance, which is good for both myself and society. So how can I overcome this difficulty? ... I thought and thought, and decided to use a friendly attitude to openly and honestly advise him not to run for the position of teacher.</p>
<p>After making up my mind, I woke up Huzi and said, "[Please get up quickly, the representatives of the whole village are about to come to the temple to hold a meeting to discuss hiring a teacher. Your Yuer and Jiner are going to school, so you must attend the meeting. This time, we must hire someone who is extremely capable to be the teacher, so that good children like Yuer and Jiner can all become talents for the country. To be honest, your knowledge is a bit old and not very useful. My knowledge is far inferior to yours, so I cannot be a teacher either. It would be better to hire a teacher with both good character and learning, and we can all learn from him together. Then we may have a day when we can become teachers in the future. I think we should hire a chief advisor, and you and I can do our duty as his assistants and students at the same time. But to be an assistant or a student, you must quit smoking opium! Do you think my opinion is wrong?]"</p>
<p>"[What you said makes sense, but there are many teachers who smoke opium! My cousin is the director of discipline at a senior high school in the city, and isn't he an old addict? However, he smokes secretly, and I smoke openly. But I do want a famous teacher to teach Yuer and Jiner, and my eight-legged essays are a bit outdated now. So, I'll ask you to visit and find a good teacher. If the teacher you hire is not good, I will still be the teacher. Remember that!]" Zhang Huzi's easy abandonment of his ambitions made me overjoyed. As we talked about this, representatives from each household had already crowded into the main hall. The representatives were of all kinds, about a hundred people... Most were farmers, but there were also bricklayers, carpenters, stonemasons, tailors, and grocery store owners. There were also many old women, and a few families who could not come sent their children instead. Our groundbreaking village assembly opened in this way.</p>
<h3>18. Special District Education</h3>
<p>Shanghai has a total of 18 districts, one of which is called the Special District, commonly referred to as the Concession. Created from unequal treaties, the education in the Special District, i.e., the British and French Concessions, today refers mainly to the education directly run by foreigners in the Concessions. The British Concession Municipal Council runs four Chinese Public Schools: 1. Yucai Public School at No. 1 Shanhaiguan Road, 2. Chinese Public School at No. 63 Heskell Road, 3. Gezhi Public School at No. 77 Beihai Road, and 4. Nie Zhongcheng Public School at No. 42 Jingzhou Road. The above four public schools are directly appointed by the Education Department of the Municipal Council with foreigners as principals. The school level is primary and secondary school. Tuition is over 40 yuan per student. The curriculum is issued by the Municipal Council.</p>
<p>Since the Chinese directors of the Taxpayers' Association proposed a plan to improve Chinese education in the Concession on March 16, 1928, the Sino-Western Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council Education Committee was established on June 18, 1930. The Chinese members were Ou Yuanhuai, Liu Zhan'en, Yuan Ludeng, and Lin Kanghou. In the same year, the Municipal Council Education Department added a Chinese Education Department to oversee some Chinese education affairs. Chen Heqin, the former professor of child psychology at Southeast University, was hired as the director. Schools with Chinese principals gradually emerged. Before the war, there was the East District Elementary School at No. 48 Huishan Road, the North District Elementary School at No. 1 Cloninghan Road, the Girls' Middle School at No. 233 Maitelhers Road, and the West District Elementary School at No. 88 Avenui Road. The operating expenses for each school were over 20,000 yuan per year.</p>
<p>With the outbreak of the war, the Municipal Council's revenue decreased by nearly 30%. The public security defense of the Concession was in a state of disrepair, and the schools were also in a state of stagnation. It was delayed until February 29 before the schools began to charge fees for registration and classes began on March 1. However, the teachers and students of the East District Elementary School and Nie Zhongcheng Public School were not yet seen at that time. The curriculum and time of the schools that had opened were slightly changed. The Chinese Public School borrowed the Gezhi school building, and the North District Elementary School borrowed the West District Elementary School building. They taught separately in the morning and afternoon. On March 14, the schools held entrance exams to recruit new students. The salary for the principals of each elementary school was 120 yuan, plus 40 yuan for board and 18 yuan for savings. The salary for the head of teaching affairs with a university degree was 105 yuan, 15 yuan for board, and 15 yuan for savings. The salary for teachers with a university degree was 90 yuan, 15 yuan for board, and 15 yuan for savings. The salary for teachers who graduated from a secondary normal school was 70 yuan, 15 yuan for board, and 15 yuan for savings. The payments were made in full as before.</p>
<p>The Huade Elementary School was being prepared during the war and opened on April 1. The new school building is located at the old site of the Zhao Shang Public School on Huade Road. It is said that in the near future, another elementary school will be added. The Girls' Middle School originally planned to allocate 400,000 yuan for construction, but now it has been suspended. The school building issue for the next semester is being discussed and has not yet been decided. The construction fee for the West District Elementary School is 220,000 yuan, and the East District is 180,000 yuan, which has been approved by the Municipal Council and will soon be started. The East District and Nie Zhongcheng are now continuing their studies. The North District Elementary School safely returned to its original location on April 25, but the students, like startled birds, who returned were still as few as morning stars. The school holiday will be extended to July 15. During the extended period, there will only be classes in the morning. The situation of the Western schools is similar to the above, so I will not go into detail. The measures for subsidizing Chinese schools in the Concession have now been decided, and the implementation period will not be far away. The Municipal Council Education Committee held a meeting on April 1 to discuss the subsidy case for foreign schools, and the decision was as follows:</p>
<h3>List of Annual Subsidies for Foreign Schools from the Municipal Council</h3>
<p>School Nationality                                       Total Subsidy Amount</p>
<p>Japanese School                                       60,000 taels</p>
<p>German School                                           3,000 taels</p>
<p>Jewish School                                           2,500 taels</p>
<p>First Russian School                                       1,500 taels</p>
<p>Borpon Girls' School                                         500 taels</p>
<p>(Note) This case was approved by the Municipal Council Board of Directors on April 6.</p>
<p>The Qiaohu Japanese Elementary School on Arilly Road in North Sichuan Road, the Japanese Senior Elementary School in Shenjiawan, and the Japanese Girls' Primary and Secondary School on Schkoda Road were all occupied by their troops during the war as bases for the invasion of Shanghai. Many school buildings were also destroyed. After more than two months of delays, preparations have finally been completed, and classes started on April 5. However, most of the students have returned to their country. Less than a hundred students, wearing cherry blossom badges, shaved heads, carrying schoolbags, and wearing wooden clogs, entered the school gates of each school. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the Dongwen College has been garrisoned by enemy troops. Most of the schools have returned to their country, and the Chinese students have long since returned to their mothers' homes to seek refuge. Now they are preparing to reopen the school. The students in the highest grade are planning to be allowed to graduate early. It is said that these students will have special opportunities for promotion and wealth. The high position of translator in the Northeast rebel agency has long been vacant, waiting for their arrival.</p>
<p>The Aurora University, Xuhui Public School, Qiming Girls' High School, and Sino-French Public Vocational School in the French Concession also closed during the war and then reopened. Because there were not many students, the ceasefire agreement was signed on the 5th, and the students of each school gradually increased, showing a trend of returning to normal. The French Municipal Council recently appointed investigators to investigate private schools, conduct school hygiene, and it is also heard that they will also imitate the public concession to organize an education committee and add Chinese elementary schools in the district. The school buildings of the elementary schools added on Kangti Road and Sapei Road have been completed. Probably after the troops withdraw, they will beat gongs and drums to prepare for enrollment.</p>
<h3>Change of Principal at Merchant Marine School</h3>
<p>Since the Wusong Merchant Marine School was suspended in the spring of 1915, the alumni of the school have worked hard and planned for a fund to be restored in the summer of 1929, when the Ministry of Communications commissioned Yang Zhixiong as the principal. In the past three years, new factories have been built and the first class of students in the marine engineering department is still in the internship period. Various shipping companies have rushed to hire them, and the results are quite impressive. Recently, because Mr. Yang's duties are numerous and he has no time to take care of them, he went to Beijing to resign. He has now been replaced by Xia Sunpeng, appointed by the Ministry of Communications, who took over and started the school yesterday. Mr. Xia was originally the dean of the school when it was founded and also served as the acting principal. He is a senior member of the shipping industry. This time, he will surely bring benefits to the school.</p>

<h3>YMCA vs. Datong University Yesterday</h3>
<h3>Track and Field Meet Results</h3>
<p>▲Field Conditions Affect Performance, Still Good ▲YMCA Representatives Selected ▲Final Practice Scheduled for Wednesday</p>
<p>The first track and field meet after the Shanghai Incident, between the YMCA and Datong University, was held yesterday at the Datong University athletic field on Jiaozhou Road under overcast skies. A large crowd attended, mostly Datong University students, with some coming from afar. The event officials were made up of teachers and students from Jiangnan Physical Education School and Datong University, as well as staff from the YMCA's sports department. The results are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Overall Results</h3>
<p>Event　　　　　First Place　　Second Place　　Third Place　　　　　　Result</p>

<h3>YMCA Representatives Selected</h3>
<p>The above athletes will represent the YMCA at the Six Major Organizations' Athletic Meet next Saturday (June 4th). They are expected to attend the final practice session at the China Athletic Field at 4:00 PM on Wednesday (June 1st), where a meeting will also be held to discuss related matters.</p>
<h3>Field Conditions Affected Performance</h3>
<p>Yesterday's results did not seem particularly outstanding, but given the athletes' lack of recent practice, these results were not easily achieved. Moreover, the Datong University High School field is in poor condition, with a very loose track and many turns, which greatly affected the 200-meter and 400-meter races. The high jump and pole vault first-place winners did not complete their jumps due to the loose track. Wang Jihuai had a minor wrist injury in the discus and javelin events, so his throws were still satisfactory.</p>
<h3>Practice, Not Competition</h3>
<p>Yesterday's meet was entirely a practice session, so no scores were kept, and no winners were declared. Everyone is considered part of one family.</p>
<h3>Jiangnan Track and Field Team's Grand Plan</h3>
<h3>Expedition to Sichuan and Hubei Planned</h3>
<p>▲Performances Along the Yangtze ▲Promoting Sports in Central and Western China</p>
<p>Chinese track and field is thriving in the coastal provinces of South, North, and East China, but not in Central and Western China. It's not that Sichuan and Hubei lack talent, but rather that they lack training. The Jiangnan Track and Field Team in Shanghai is dedicated to track and field, sparing no effort. Last summer, they traveled north. This summer, they originally planned to turn south to compete in Hong Kong and Guangdong, but the situation in those two provinces suddenly became tense, creating obstacles for their southern journey. Therefore, they considered that track and field is in its infancy in Sichuan and Hubei. If they could travel there to perform as a model for promotion, it would greatly contribute to the development of sports in China in the future. Moreover, students from Sichuan and Hubei studying sports in Shanghai have earnestly requested their visit. Therefore, the team decided to travel west. They are currently planning everything, including financial matters. They plan to depart around late June with a small number of members, traveling west along the Yangtze River, performing in various locations along the river in Anhui and Jiangxi, then to Hankou, then Chongqing, with Chengdu as their final destination. We hope for the success of this grand endeavor.</p>

Details are as follows: ▲Personnel Dispatched: The Takeover Committee dispatched five special commissioners: Tao Xiaojie, Li Shengjun, Huo Shi, Liang Fuchu, and Liu Yumen, accompanied by Li Jing, the district chief of the 7th District of the Public Security Bureau, Yang Qianqing, the head of the 7th District 1st Precinct, Feng Ren, the head of the 7th District 2nd Precinct, and Wu Tingxun, Liao Chengzhang, and Dai Hongen, the heads of the 5th District 3rd, 4th, and 5th Precincts, leading five police squads, totaling approximately 150 people, to implement the restoration of administrative power in their respective jurisdictions and to deploy checkpoints. ▲Implementation: The special commissioners of the Takeover Committee and the heads of the 5th and 7th Districts of the Public Security Bureau, along with their personnel, gathered at the Joint Society around 8:00 AM yesterday morning and departed together, first going to the Zhabei Office of the Public Security Bureau on Gonghe Xin Road in Zhabei. At 8:30 AM, they led five police squads from there to implement the plan at various locations. Yang Qianqing and Feng Ren, the heads of the 7th District 1st and 2nd Precincts, led two police squads, approximately 60 people, to deploy checkpoints in the Wusong temporarily garrisoned area. Wu Tingxun, Liao Chengzhang, and Dai Hongen, the heads of the 5th District 3rd, 4th, and 5th Precincts, each led one police squad, totaling 90 people, to deploy checkpoints in the Yinhang and Yinxiang areas. By 5:00 PM, the operation was completely finished, and the process went smoothly. ▲Checkpoint Announcement: Checkpoints in Yinhang and Shenjiahang were fully established by 5:00 PM today (yesterday), restoring police authority. There is no longer any trace of Japanese troops in these two areas. Furthermore, the 4th District 2nd Precinct reported that most merchants and residents within its jurisdiction have returned and resumed business. They are supervising sanitation along the roads and increasing patrols daily. At the border with the concession, they are inspecting vehicles and pedestrians at key intersections to prevent troublemakers from taking advantage of the situation. ▲D District Not Yet Restored: Of the four temporarily garrisoned areas, only D District, i.e., the Zhabei temporarily garrisoned area, has not yet begun to be restored. The Japanese troops stationed in that area are entirely naval marines. Because the Japanese army and navy are separate, their withdrawals are unrelated. Therefore, the administrative power in that area has not yet begun to be restored. It is rumored that the Takeover Committee intends to begin the restoration of administrative power in that area after the complete withdrawal of the Japanese army, or after all takeover procedures related to the Japanese army have been properly handled. The estimated time for this is around the 2nd to 7th of next month. ▲Continued Takeovers Pending: Aside from the four temporarily garrisoned areas, the takeover of other locations has been largely completed. Remaining areas include: (1) the area under the jurisdiction of the 5th District 2nd Precinct, i.e., the eastern part of the Shajing River and the area around Hujia Muqiao; (2) locations where roads were built across the border in the eastern part of Songhu Road in Zhabei; (3) the Toyoda Cotton Mill in West Shanghai; (4) the Xujiahui Catholic School. The takeover period of the above four locations under the Japanese naval marines will be within the four weeks stipulated by the armistice agreement after the complete withdrawal of the Japanese army. ▲Taking Over the Factory: The Zhang Huabang railway factory of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau in Wusong will be thoroughly taken over at 8:00 AM today. The Chinese Takeover Committee will send Secretary Li Mu and Secretary Yin Tixin of the Public Security Bureau, and the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau will send engineer Mr. Texford. The Japanese side will send personnel from the military authorities to hand over the factory. ▲Taking Over Schools: Yesterday, the takeover of Yinxiang District, Yinhang District, and parts of Wusong, Jiangwan, and Zhabei included 22 municipal primary schools and 25 national and private universities, middle schools, and primary schools. The Municipal Education Bureau sent personnel to take over and inspect the schools. They found that the Municipal Lubin School had been destroyed, while the others suffered slight damage. The National Central Business College, Chizhi College, Art College, Shanghai Law College, and Nanyang Business School were completely destroyed. Most of the Women's School was burned. The buildings of Fudan University, Southeast Women's Physical Education School, and Yuqing Middle School still stand, but the interiors were damaged. Fudan University and Yucai Primary School were garrisoned by Japanese troops, who withdrew at 2:00 PM yesterday. ▲Areas Already Taken Over: Yesterday, the Takeover Committee announced a list of place names of areas that have been taken over:</p>

<h3>Garrison Alert in Longhua</h3>
<p>— The 2nd Company of Military Police Will Arrive in Shanghai Today</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, in view of the separate withdrawals of Japanese troops and the gradual restoration of order in various locations, the Shanghai Garrison Command received a telegram from the Ministry of Military Affairs yesterday, ordering the transfer of the 2nd Company of Military Police from Suzhou to Shanghai to guard the Longhua area. It is reported that the incoming troops are from the 6th Regiment and number over 200. They are expected to arrive in Longhua today.</p>
<h3>The Railway Bureau Yesterday</h3>
<h3>Took Over the Songhu Branch Line</h3>
<p>▲At Tiantong'an and Other Stations ▲Takeover Expected Soon</p>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau was notified by the Takeover Committee that they would take over the administrative power of the Japanese temporarily garrisoned areas in the middle section of the Songhu Branch Line yesterday. They were instructed to send personnel to take over the stations in Jiangwan, Gaojingmiao, and the Wusong Branch Line within that area. Chen Xinghan, the director of the Bureau, immediately dispatched Li Jingsheng and Wang Liansheng, the stationmasters of Jiangwan Station, Zhou Jinlong and Deng Yuhe, the stationmasters of Gaojingmiao Station, and Xue Xigen and Chen Yudai, the stationmasters of the Wusong Branch Line, led by Zhuang Qin and Zhang Xuetao, the takeover personnel of the Bureau. At 9:00 AM yesterday, they rode in two cars, driving directly to Jiangwan Station and disembarking. They left the two stationmasters of Jiangwan Station at the station, then proceeded to Gaojingmiao and Wusong Branch Line stations to take over in turn. Because they had contacted the Japanese side in advance, the Japanese troops had withdrawn in advance when they went to take over yesterday, and there were no difficulties. It is reported that the Tiantong'an, Yunzaobang, and Zhang Huabang stations will also be taken over within two or three days. At that time, after slightly repairing the tracks and bridges, traffic will be restored, and the period will not be far off.</p>
<h3>San You Factory</h3>
<h3>Japanese Troops Withdraw This Morning</h3>
<p>— The 4th Precinct of the 5th District Will Temporarily Borrow the Site for Office Use</p>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, the main factory of the San You Industrial Company in Yinxianggang has been occupied by Japanese troops for nearly four months. A reporter from the Dagong News Agency visited yesterday and learned that the Japanese troops in the factory have decided to withdraw this morning. The details are as follows: ▲Circumstances of the Occupation: The factory covers a wide area, with a public road running through the middle, with gates set up at both ends, which are usually opened and closed for pedestrians. After the Shanghai Incident, at the request of the manager of the Donghua Cotton Mill, the factory gave up the public road to facilitate the movement of Japanese troops, cutting the factory into two sections. The rear section was used for workers' dormitories and a sports field. Later, when the Japanese troops wanted to forcibly occupy the factory to garrison troops, the Shanghai Municipal Council intervened, and the rear section of the factory was temporarily allowed to be used by the Japanese troops to garrison troops. ▲Extent of the Damage: After the Japanese troops garrisoned the rear section of the factory, they used a large amount of electricity and water every day. The Japanese officers agreed to pay the factory 30 yuan per day in subsidies. As for the barracks built by the Japanese troops, they could not be demolished due to time constraints, so they would compensate the factory for the loss. ▲The Police Station Borrows the Site for Office Use: Liao Chengzhang, the head of the 4th Precinct of the 5th District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, whose original office was burned down by the Japanese troops, has temporarily borrowed the meeting place of the San You Industrial Company Workers' Union for temporary office use.</p>
<h3>Boy Scouts</h3>
<h3>Full Demobilization Today</h3>
<p>— Special Train Returns to Shanghai at 10:00 AM</p>
<p>The Battlefield Service Corps of the Shanghai Boy Scout Council sent a large number of Boy Scouts to work on the front lines after the change of defense lines of our army, which was highly commended by various sectors of the local community. After the end of the war, some of the Corps' personnel arrived in Shanghai a few days ago. It is now reported that the rear office of the Corps received a telegram from Suzhou yesterday, stating that all the Corps members remaining in Suzhou participated in the memorial service for the fallen soldiers in the Shanghai Anti-Japanese War and will return to Shanghai by special train from Suzhou this morning, arriving at the North Station at about 10:00 AM. In addition to all the Corps members remaining in Shanghai and representatives sent by various Boy Scout groups in Shanghai to welcome them, various groups in Shanghai have also sent representatives after hearing the news to welcome them at that time.</p>

<h3>Guangdong Groups</h3>
<h3>Telegraphed to Request Mediation of the Guangdong Situation</h3>
<p>The Guangzhou-Zhaoqing Public Association and the Guangdong Overseas Chinese Businessmen's Association sent a telegram to the key figures in Guangdong: Honorable Mr. Tang Shaochuan, Honorable Mr. Deng Zheru, Honorable Mr. Xiao Focheng, Honorable Mr. Chen Bonan, Honorable Mr. Zou Haibin, and Honorable Mr. Wu Tiyun of the Southwest Political Affairs Committee of Guangzhou, and forwarded to all members: Our Guangdong has been in turmoil for years, barely recovering, and the people are exhausted. Finally, there is some stability, but recently, the issue of reorganizing the naval and air forces has caused internal strife. The Shanghai newspapers widely report that General Bonan is advocating for a military solution, causing great concern in our homeland. Regardless of the fact that the country is facing foreign threats, brothers should not fight among themselves, and our homeland, which is recovering, should not suffer the disaster of war. It is heard that Mr. Hu Zhantang has been appointed to mediate, which is deeply hoped for by the Cantonese people in Shanghai. You, gentlemen, love your hometown and your country and should have the same sentiments. To resolve the issue, it is incumbent upon you to mediate and remedy the situation to stabilize Guangdong and calm the people. We ask for a reply.

<h3>The Confiscated Goods Investigation Committee</h3>
<h3>Took Stock of Confiscated Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>The Confiscated Goods Investigation Committee of the former Anti-Japanese Association, organized by the Municipal Government and various groups, began to take stock of the confiscated goods after its establishment. They completed the inventory of the confiscated goods in the East, West, and South warehouses of the Anti-Japanese Association a few days ago. However, for the important goods stored in various foreign warehouses, they were unable to proceed because the warehouse receipts had not been submitted. They ordered the Anti-Japanese Association to submit them quickly so that they could take stock. Although the North warehouse and the Wusong warehouse were destroyed by artillery fire due to the war, the Investigation Committee also decided to take stock.</p>

<h3>Yesterday</h3>
<h3>Shirakawa's Remains Returned to His Country</h3>
<p>— Many Japanese Residents Went to Hold the Funeral Rope</p>
<p>Shirakawa Yoshinori, the commander of the Japanese army, died of illness on the 26th. The Japanese government specially sent the Tatsuta warship to welcome his remains back to his country. The warship arrived in Shanghai yesterday to load the remains. The details are recorded as follows: ▲Warship Arrived in Shanghai: The Tatsuta warship, specially sent by the Japanese Navy Ministry, arrived in Wusong at 11:00 AM yesterday and immediately sailed into the Huangpu River, arriving directly at the Huishan Wharf in Yangshupu to dock. Two torpedo boats from the 15th Squadron of the Navy stationed in Shanghai were also waiting in the Huangpu River to escort the warship. ▲Remains Loaded onto the Ship: Shirakawa's remains were transported by gun carriage and arrived at the Huishan Wharf at noon. The headquarters and Japanese naval officers stationed in Shanghai went to hold the funeral rope. Chief of Staff Tashiro was also the escort commissioner, so he arrived at the wharf first to direct everything. Many Japanese residents held small flags and went to the wharf to attend the funeral. When the remains arrived at the wharf, mourning music was played loudly. ▲Heading to Japan: At 2:00 PM, Shirakawa's remains were loaded into the Tatsuta warship. With a blast of the whistle, the ship weighed anchor and sailed away from Wusong, heading directly back to Japan. Rear Admiral Nomura, the commander of the Japanese Navy stationed in Shanghai, first sent four torpedo boats from the 24th Squadron to lead the way, and then added two torpedo boats from the 15th Squadron to escort the Tatsuta warship.</p>
<h3>Yoon Bong-gil Was Sent to Japan Yesterday</h3>

<h3>The Vatican Road British Soldier Assault Case</h3>
<h3>The Municipal Government Protested Yesterday</h3>
<p>— Punish the British Soldiers Who Caused the Incident</p>
<p>— Retain the Right to Demand Compensation</p>
<p>— Expedite the Withdrawal of the Garrison at That Location</p>
<p>The Municipal Government protested to the British Consul-General in Shanghai yesterday regarding the case of a British soldier stabbing pedestrians on Vatican Road. The protest letter is recorded as follows: To the Honorable Sir, according to Yang Hongjun, a municipal commissioner of the French Concession in Shanghai, it is reported that after 7:00 PM on the 22nd of this month, three people, Chen Guiting, a rickshaw puller, and Zhu Guixin and Fu Shenghong, pedestrians, arrived at the railway bridge on Vatican Road, where they were prevented from passing by British soldiers stationed there. The three, Chen Guiting and others, had already turned back, but the British soldiers suddenly used bayonets to stab the three, causing serious injuries. Zhu Guixin was the most seriously injured and his life may be in danger. In response to this, it is found that the situation is now stable, and the concessions have long been lifted from martial law. The railway bridge on Vatican Road is located in the Chinese area and there is no need for British soldiers to be stationed there. Now that the rickshaw puller Chen Guiting and the pedestrians Zhu Guixin and others had already obeyed and turned back, the British soldiers still arbitrarily caused the incident, causing serious injuries to these people and endangering their lives, which is highly inappropriate. In view of the above, I hereby write to request that you instruct the military authorities to investigate the British soldiers who caused the incident and punish them, and expedite the withdrawal of the garrison at that location to facilitate traffic. The Municipal Government simultaneously declares that it reserves the right to demand compensation. I hope to receive a reply. This is addressed to Sir John Brenan, British Consul-General in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Missing Postman</h3>
<h3>Discovery of a Corpse by the Riverbank</h3>
<p>— Discovered in front of the Nisshin Wharf</p>
<p>— Hands and feet chopped off, a truly tragic sight</p>
<p>Chen Fangxiang and Su Koucai, two postmen from the Postal Branch at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Dithmarschen Road, disappeared simultaneously after the outbreak of the Shanghai Battle on January 29th of this year. Four months later, Chen's body was suddenly discovered yesterday by the riverbank at the Nisshin Company wharf in Hongkou. Details are recorded below: ▲ A Truly Tragic State Yesterday at 9:50 AM, Chinese Constable No. 55 and Western Constable Cortland of the Customs Water Police Station were patrolling the river near the Nisshin Company wharf in Hongkou when they suddenly discovered a corpse wearing a green uniform. The collar had the number 55. The face was already blurred, and both hands and feet were completely chopped off, a truly tragic sight. The body was not complete; actually, only the torso and head remained. The two constables determined that the deceased was wearing a postal uniform and immediately took the body back to the police station for disposal. ▲ Circumstances of the Disappearance The police station immediately dispatched detectives to investigate at the Postal Headquarters, learning that the deceased was named Chen Fangxiang, 27 or 28 years old, from Ningbo, residing at No. 4 Boting Lane, Wu Jiaqiao Road, Dadongmen. He was a postman at the Postal Branch at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Dithmarschen Road. On January 29th of this year, at 7:00 AM, Chen and four colleagues borrowed bicycles to go to the branch office to wait for the headquarters to send down the mail, preparing to distribute it. At that time, the war had already started the night before, and the area was close to the war zone, so the sound of gunfire was deafening. Chen and the others waited until 10:00 AM, but the headquarters had not sent the mail. Fearing danger after waiting for a long time, they stored their bicycles in the office, and the five went out and parted ways to go home. Unexpectedly, Chen and Su were suddenly arrested by the Japanese army. The remaining three, after many hardships, managed to return home and immediately informed Chen and Su's families, asking them to find ways to rescue them. Chen and Su's families were shocked and immediately reported to the Postal Headquarters, which sent personnel to negotiate with the Public Works Department and the Japanese military headquarters. However, the Japanese army claimed ignorance, and rescue efforts were unsuccessful for many days. Now, four months have passed, and the matter has faded. Unexpectedly, Chen's body suddenly floated to the surface. ▲ Handling the Aftermath After learning of the situation yesterday, the Postal Headquarters immediately notified the family to prepare for handling the funeral. The police station, as usual, transported the body to the South City Life Saving Bureau and reported it to the local court for an autopsy. It is reported that the court is scheduled to send personnel to examine the body tomorrow (Monday), so the body cannot be collected today.</p>
<h3>A Scene of Infighting Among Traitors</h3>
<p>— Quarrel Over Unequal Distribution of Booty, Facing Each Other with Guns</p>
<p>— All Large and Small Gambling Dens Temporarily Closed</p>
<p>Hu Lifu, Chang Yuqing, Wang Du, and other traitors, abandoned by the Chinese people, lurk under the protection of the Japanese, recklessly engaging in speculative and traitorous activities, monopolizing all illegal matters related to opium, gambling, and prostitution. Various newspapers have reported on this countless times, so there is no need to elaborate. Yesterday, a reporter happened to be somewhere and caught a glimpse of two young men talking about the activities of the traitors in Zhabei. Judging from their appearance, one of them seemed to be a second- or third-rate traitor. According to them, recently, as the Japanese army successively withdrew, the traitors suddenly lost their protection, like bereaved parents. They are still trying to make a final struggle. The day before yesterday, Hu Lifu and Wang Du suddenly had a disagreement over the unequal distribution of booty, leading to a sudden quarrel. After exchanging insults, the two actually took out their guns, intending to stage a tragicomedy of mutual slaughter. Fortunately, Chang Yuqing was present and did his best to mediate, offering earnest advice to Hu and Wang, saying, "We are now in a precarious situation, with death imminent. Instead of seeking self-preservation, you are still wielding weapons against each other, causing internal strife, which is truly not a blessing for our future." Thus, a play of infighting among traitors was not staged. However, since yesterday, all the large and small gambling dens protected by these people have been temporarily closed due to the internal strife. They will wait two or three days before establishing a strong, special organization to continue operating.</p>
<h3>Songhu Garrison Headquarters</h3>
<h3>Thorough Investigation of the East China Railway's Shanghai Office</h3>
<p>— Letter to Various Organizations of the National Salvation United Association Reporting the Progress</p>
<p>The Shanghai Organizations of the National Salvation United Association, because the puppet government dared to establish an office of the East China Railway in this city and even hung a puppet flag, previously sent a letter to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters requesting strict action. Yesterday, the association received a letter from the headquarters. The original text is recorded below: "Sirs, Regarding the case of handling the office of the Chinese Eastern Railway stationed in Shanghai, as requested in your previous letter, we ordered the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau to investigate and report back for verification and handling, and replied to you in a letter. Now, according to the report from the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, 'Having received the order to investigate the situation of the Chinese Eastern Railway office stationed in Shanghai, we immediately ordered the Supervisory Office to send personnel to the Third District to investigate and report back. Subsequently, we received a report stating that we immediately rushed to the Second District of Pudong to handle the matter together. According to Director Zhang, the wharf and warehouse of the East China Railway are located at Yangjiadu Wharf, under the jurisdiction of the First Precinct of the Third District. We ordered Inspector Zeng to accompany us, and Director Yang accompanied us to the wharf and warehouse of the East China Railway. According to Zhang Minkai, an officer of the warehouse, the office of the East China Railway stationed in Shanghai is indeed located at No. 5 Guangdong Road. The director is a Soviet, and the deputy director is Qian Jieceng. After the Japanese bandits invaded the East China Railway and seized it for the puppet government, Qian Jieceng resigned and fled. The puppet government then appointed Shao Peng to take over, but Shao Peng has not come to the office to take up his post. It is said that he has sent a letter to the municipal government declaring that he would not take office and become a puppet. Whether this is true or not cannot be verified. As for hanging the puppet flag and using the 'Datong First Year' era name on the donation records, there is no such thing. The flags displayed at this office have always been mainly railway flags, and other national flags have not been displayed,' etc. We have attached a business card and submitted a report with the above findings for your review." As this matter falls within the scope of our authority, in addition to reporting to the Executive Yuan, we are writing to reply to you and hope you will take note. Sincerely, Dai Ji, Commander of the Songhu Garrison, May 24."</p>
<h3>Jiangwan War Victims Association</h3>
<h3>Proposes Urgent Agricultural Relief</h3>
<p>Wu Xuen, the managing director of the Jiangwan War Victims United Association, is currently appointed by the municipal government as a member of the War Zone Rehabilitation Committee of this city. Yesterday, he proposed urgent agricultural relief and sent a letter to the association stating: "After the January 28th Shanghai Incident, the entire area of Jiangwan was the focus of the war. Since the enemy army ordered a general attack on February 20th, the towns and villages were bombed for ten days. According to the current registry, over 3,100 houses in the towns and villages were burned and bombed, and an estimated 1,300 households and over 4,400 houses in the villages were burned. There are more reports yet to be included. The remaining clothing, food, and utensils were also looted. Now that the various shelters in Shanghai have all been closed, the displaced victims, although they have no homes to return to, must return to their homeland as soon as possible. On the 19th of this month, I returned to Jiangwan to take over. In my hometown, I saw the blue sky and white sun flag again, but the victims blocked the road, weeping and complaining about having no clothes, no food, and no shelter. I wanted to help but lacked the strength, and I wanted to comfort them but had no words. I only remembered that the northern part of Jiangwan has always been an agricultural area, and this war has particularly affected the northern part. At this time of sowing, to ensure that farmers can produce with peace of mind, we must first ensure that they have clothing, food, and shelter. My limited view is that the disaster situation in Jiangwan is more serious than in Zhabei and Wusong. Zhabei and Wusong are both commercial and industrial areas. Once transportation is restored, the owners of the burned and bombed houses will be happy to rebuild, and investors will also be more enthusiastic. The past prosperity will be easily restored. In Jiangwan, except for the towns and villages, most of the rural farmers are poor. They have no way to obtain clothing and food, let alone build thatched huts to live in. If we do not provide urgent relief in advance, I fear that the old and weak will end up in ditches, and the strong will scatter in all directions. This would be contrary to the purpose of serving the fields. Based on the above reasons, I dare to represent the victims and request urgent relief in advance."</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Submits to the Bureau of Social Affairs</h3>
<h3>Digging Up Leases Should Be Prohibited for Post-War Rehabilitation</h3>
<p>— Original Tenants Have Priority in Negotiating for Shop Bases</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted a document to the Bureau of Social Affairs yesterday, requesting the issuance of a public notice to prohibit grabbing and digging up leases. The document stated: "This is to submit a request. On the 27th of this month, the Wusong Branch of our affiliated association sent a letter stating that the losses suffered by Songzhen this time are a huge catastrophe unprecedented in thousands of years. The prosperous towns have turned into rubble, and most of the houses owned by various businesses are leased. Now, in the aftermath of this impact, we are deeply concerned that disputes may arise due to grabbing and digging up leases. In view of this, the association held a meeting and unanimously decided that the original tenants should have priority in negotiating for the original shop bases, and should not be grabbed or dug up, so as to avoid the original tenants from having nowhere to operate. We have specially submitted this document to your esteemed association for review and record, and request that you forward it to the relevant authorities to issue a public notice to avoid disputes and benefit commercial transportation. This is our sincere hope.' Upon receipt, we have found that the destruction of houses by the Japanese invaders in Songzhen is not small, and the alleged grabbing and digging up of leases is within our expectations. However, for post-war rehabilitation, the first priority should be to vigorously plan for pacification so that the people can resume their businesses as soon as possible. If we allow them to grab and dig up leases, the disaster-stricken shops will have no businesses to resume, and will become more displaced. The request to issue a public notice by the competent authorities, stating that the original tenants should have priority in negotiating for the original shop bases, is a legitimate request. We hereby submit this document to your bureau for review and approval, and we believe it is in the public interest to handle it as requested."</p>

We deeply regret the destruction of peace and the extinction of humanity. We dare not hesitate and have established the Municipal and Local Maintenance Association. Furthermore, in order to correct the international view of the county and arouse the public's common situation, the Liaison Group was established to counter the other party's wanton slander and Gong Lun. The Liaison Group has made special efforts in disseminating accurate information at home and abroad, compiling various publications, investigating and collecting statistics on the local situation, and contacting and receiving Chinese and foreign personnel. All of these are detailed in the work report to inform the society and members. Furthermore, since the European War, the international situation has been complex, with intricate strategies far exceeding the state before 1914. The slightest movement affects the whole body, and it is closely related to world peace and China's future. Future changes are unpredictable. Therefore, the seriousness and necessity of our future work are ten or a hundred times greater than today. Without in-depth research, there is no possibility of responding to the environment. The Japan Association for Foreign Affairs, the British International Law Association (International Law Association, London), and the American Council on Foreign Relations (Council of Foreign Relations, N.Y.) all strive to use national diplomacy as a backing for government facilities, and public opinion regards it as a model. The effectiveness of its potential force is no less than that of the altar. We, the undersigned, in view of the above-mentioned needs, have organized the International Problems Research Association, gathering diplomatic experts and leaders from all walks of life to engage in this task, and continue the unfinished work of the Liaison Group of the Municipal and Local Maintenance Association. All international events and Chinese and foreign issues are within the scope of the Association's work and contribution. It may be the beginning of our country's national diplomacy. At the beginning of its establishment, we publish the work plan to the society, hoping that our fellow countrymen will come and join us." ▲ Work Plan The Association's work is divided into three categories: research, publication and lectures, and social activities.

<h3>Navigation Bureau's Fee Collection in Zhejiang</h3>
<h3>Appeal from the Coal and Stone Barge Association</h3>
<p>The Coal and Stone Barge Industry Association of this city telegraphed the Zhejiang Provincial Government yesterday: "To Chairman Lu of the Zhejiang Provincial Government in Hangzhou: We have received reports from members of our association that barges already registered with the Shanghai Municipal Council are being detained by the Navigation Bureau while passing through Hangzhou and forced to pay a large registration fee. We request that you telegraph the Zhejiang Provincial Government to provide relief. The Suzhou-Anhui office of the Navigation Bureau has been abolished, and the central government has not yet issued clear regulations on which agency is responsible for barge registration. Our association has telegraphed the Executive Yuan for review. Moreover, the barges of our association have already been measured and registered by the Shanghai Municipal Council and pay monthly boat donations. How can they be re-taxed, oppressing boat owners? This is not something that should happen under a democratic government. Before the central government issues clear regulations, we request that your government order the affiliated Navigation Bureau to refrain from re-taxing or arbitrarily detaining boats, hindering navigation, and harming the livelihoods of boat owners. We are in urgent need of your attention." Chairman Ruan Xuedao, Standing Committee Members Tang Jinshu, Yuan Genquan, Cao Yuyu, and Fan Deyu of the Shanghai Coal and Stone Barge Industry Association.</p>

<h3>All Iron Gates in the French Concession Open</h3>
<p>The French Concession authorities, in order to maintain the safety of the concession after the outbreak of war in northern Shanghai, closed the iron gates on the Min Guo Road area bordering the Chinese city and built defenses. Now that the situation has calmed down, the sandbags have been removed from the roads one after another, and all the iron gates on the border between the Chinese city and the French Concession have been opened since yesterday to facilitate pedestrian traffic and restore normal conditions.</p>
<h3>Municipal Bureau of Health</h3>
<h3>Announces Recent Situation of Disease Investigation and Prevention</h3>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Health stated that cholera patients were discovered as early as April 26th of this year, which is earlier than in recent years. It can be seen that this year, due to the Japanese invasion, there will be a severe epidemic. Therefore, investigation and prevention are being carried out with all efforts. According to the investigation, from April 26th, when the first cholera patient was discovered, to May 26th, a total of 65 people contracted cholera within one month. 30 of them lived in the International Settlement, 7 in the French Concession, and 28 within the jurisdiction of Shanghai. Most of the patients came from the areas along the Beixinjing, Caojiadu, Xiaoshadu, Suzhou River, and Pudong. None of these places have running water, and it is presumed that drinking raw water from the Suzhou River and Huangpu River is the main cause of cholera. It was also found that most of the patients were from the working class, which shows that the working class has more opportunities to drink raw water. Therefore, the bureau immediately issued public notices and guidance on key points of personal epidemic prevention, and vigorously promoted free vaccination. Since the start of vaccination on May 16th, more than 76,000 doses have been administered to citizens within ten days. The bureau is still making every effort to investigate and provide free vaccinations, and will continue to implement epidemic prevention work until mid-September.</p>

<h3>Passengers on the Qitai Wheel Tragically Killed by Bandits</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Jiangsu Company's Qitai Wheel was involved in an incident where a cook secretly brought passengers on board, was expelled by the shipowner, and resulted in the tragic killing of the passengers by bandits. After a detailed investigation by the reporter, the details are as follows: ▲ Cook Brings Passengers Passengers secretly boarding ships by being smuggled on board by crew members such as waiters are commonly referred to as "smuggling". The Jiangsu-Zhejiang Company's Qitai Wheel, which sailed from Chongqing to Shanghai this time, was at the Chenglingji River when the shipowner decided to check tickets himself, as Shanghai-Jiangsu vessels often had bandits mixed in as passengers in order to rob the passengers. During the ticket check, two passengers were found in the cabin without tickets. It was then found that two other passengers had not bought tickets and had disembarked in Chongqing. After questioning, it was found that they had been secretly brought on board by the ship's cook. The shipowner, surnamed Lai, was furious and forced the four passengers and the cook to go ashore immediately and not stay on the ship. ▲ Comprador Mediation Chenglingji is an area with the most bandits. The four passengers and the cook would inevitably be harmed by bandits if they went ashore. As they were in a stalemate, the ship's comprador, Gu Sizhong, acted as a mediator and persuaded the shipowner to allow the five to stay on board temporarily until they disembarked in Hankou, agreeing to pay a ticket price of two yuan per person. However, the shipowner firmly refused and immediately ordered a sampan to be launched, forcing the five to leave the ship and go ashore, which led to a tragic incident. ▲ Soldiers and Bandits Exchange Fire When the four passengers and the cook were forced onto the sampan to go ashore at Chenglingji, a large group of bandits happened to be there. Seeing the five people being rowed to shore, they suspected that the soldiers on the ship were making things difficult for the bandits. The bandits on the shore immediately opened fire on the Qitai Wheel. A platoon of U.S. Navy personnel stationed on the Qitai also returned fire with machine guns. A major battle broke out between the soldiers and bandits, and the five landed ashore amidst a hail of bullets. ▲ Four Passengers Die When the four passengers went ashore, they were caught in the crossfire. One passenger was immediately shot and killed by the bandits. The other three passengers suddenly went missing and have not been found since. They were obviously killed by the bandits. Only the cook managed to escape back to Yichang after many hardships and reported to the Sichuan Fellow Villagers Association, saying that the owner of the Qitai Wheel disregarded humanity by forcibly sending five people ashore in a bandit area, causing them to die unnaturally. He asked the Fellow Villagers Association to negotiate with the shipowner to avenge the wronged souls.</p>
<h3>More Details on the Shanghai-Jiangsu Vessel Accident</h3>
<p>▲ Emei Runs Aground The Shanghai-Jiangsu Shipping Company's Emei Wheel, which was sailing to Chongqing and departing from Yichang, ran aground on a hidden reef in the river near Jun County due to the navigator's carelessness. The bow of the Emei was breached, and the river water rushed into the bow compartment, causing the bow to sink and the stern to rise, which was quite dangerous. Fortunately, the shipowner urgently ordered the breach to be temporarily repaired, and then the accumulated water was pumped out, allowing the ship to float back to the surface. Yesterday, a telegram was received stating that the ship had left Fengdu and was heading to Chongqing. The damaged part of the ship needs to be greatly repaired. The goods damaged by water are being checked. ▲ More News from Yiling The Jiang-Zhe Company's Yiling Wheel lost at Yangdu Creek has been reported yesterday. I have also learned that the bank has continued to report that the number of fallen passengers who have proven death and lost is 16, and the crew members and sailors who were unable to escape at that time are about 7-8 people. The cause of the ship's accident was due to the surge in the turbulent stream, and the ship's body hit the dark reef, and the outside of the ship broke a large hole, so it sank in two minutes. A part of the taken passengers who grabbed the life-saving ring was rescued after falling into the water. There is now a U.S. warship there to help salvage the body. All the passengers who were killed in this accident were Chinese and there were no Westerners.</p>
<h3>Departmental Order for Anhui Finance Office to Release Egg Shipments</h3>

<h3>Thirty Plus Years of Marriage</h3>
<h3>Requesting Divorce from the Court</h3>
<p>The woman, Wang Jinshi, is 49 years old. In the 27th year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, she married Wang Zhenbiao, a man from Ningbo, who is now 54 years old. They have been married for over thirty years. Recently, Wang Jinshi filed a petition with the First Special District Court for mediation, claiming that her husband maliciously abandoned her and neglected her support. Yesterday, Judge Xiao Xiecai summoned both parties to court for mediation. According to Wang Jinshi, since the marriage until 1920, the defendant's behavior changed. He frequently subjected her to violent beatings. In 1922, the defendant, under the pretext of returning to his hometown to sweep the tombs, married Qian Shichang's sister, A'yu, at the Zhongxi Hotel on the north bank of the Jiangbei River in Ningbo. A month later, he brought her to Shanghai and lived in Taoyuanfang, Hongkou. At the time, she wanted to sue him for bigamy, but after mediation by fellow villagers Sun Peilan and Chen Liangyu, he provided a monthly allowance. However, starting in July 1924, the allowance was cut off. On April 20, 1925, A'yu ran away with their belongings. In May, the defendant returned home to live with her for less than a month before taking all her belongings and disappearing. At that time, she relied entirely on her own hands to make a living. In November 1926, the defendant, in a state of distress, returned with what he had taken. He asked fellow villagers Shen Xilong and Hu Liansheng to persuade her to live with him. Considering their marital bond, she moved to 336 Hongshunli, Gongping Road to live with him. In June 1930, Shen Xilong recommended him to work at the Longxi Restaurant at the intersection of Broadway and Nansun Road. However, after entering the restaurant, his income increased significantly, but his old habits gradually reappeared. He continued to frequent prostitutes and neglected his wife. In order to make a living, she took a job as a manager at the Shanghai Elementary School in the South City in July of last year to try to survive. After the war, the students dispersed and the job ceased. She had no way to make a living. Therefore, she requests the defendant to provide a monthly allowance of thirty yuan and deposit five thousand yuan in the bank for future use. She also requests that he pay off the debts incurred because of the defendant. The defendant, Wang Zhenbiao, did not appear in court and appointed lawyer Gu Hanli to represent him. He stated that the parties have been married for over thirty years. Last year, Wang Jinshi left without saying goodbye. Now that she has come to court requesting mediation, the defendant is very willing to have her return home and restore their marriage. As for the debts, he cannot be held liable based on unsubstantiated claims. However, Wang Jinshi insisted that the defendant must agree to repay the debts before she would agree to live with him. As a result, the mediation failed to reach an agreement. The court ordered a formal lawsuit to be filed.</p>
<h3>Thirteen-Year-Old Girl Attempts Suicide in River, Rescued</h3>
<p>— Grandmother Indulges Younger Brother</p>
<p>— Resentment Leads to Suicide Attempt</p>
<p>Su Shenwu, a police officer from the First Precinct of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, was patrolling the Huangpu Riverbank at Fengji Wharf in the South City at around 7:00 AM yesterday when he suddenly heard a "plop" in the water, and waves splashed. He rushed to investigate and found a woman had jumped into the river and was sinking. He immediately called out to nearby boatmen to rescue her. After pulling her out of the water, he realized the girl was only a little over ten years old and was very surprised. At that time, the girl had been in the water for some time, and the cold water had penetrated her skin, causing her to become disoriented. He tried to revive her and brought her back to the station. During the preliminary interrogation by the station chief, the girl stood upright before the desk. When asked her name and hometown, the girl said, "I want to die quickly now. Please don't ask me in detail." After repeated questioning, the girl asked for a blank sheet of paper and a pen. She took the pen and wrote her name, Wei Qinghua, 13 years old, from Suzhou. Her home is at 3 Yuqing Lane, Puyu West Road, outside the South Gate. Her writing was swift and her handwriting was neat and impressive. He asked her why she jumped into the river. The girl slowly explained, "I am studying at a certain elementary school outside the South Gate. My parents recently went back to their hometown to sweep the tombs. Only me and my two younger brothers, as well as my maternal grandmother, Xi Li, are guarding the house. Today, I had an argument with my younger brother over something. My grandmother actually helped my younger brother and scolded me unfairly. I was so angry that I couldn't calm down, so I jumped into the river to die." The station chief jokingly said, "Committing suicide is a serious offense." The girl did not hesitate and said directly, "If there is such a regulation, please punish me according to the regulations." He saw that she was young, with beautiful features, quick-witted, and truly talented. He kindly persuaded her for a long time before sending a police officer to escort her home and instructing her family to take good care of her.</p>

The police from the First Precinct arrested the suspected arsonist. Yesterday, they ordered Zhang Hongxun, the local bailiff of the Six Nations area, to report to the local court for an examination. Zhou Wende petitioned the court to waive the examination.</p>

<h3>Armed Robbery of Detective</h3>
<h3>Multiple Robberies Confessed by Gang</h3>
<p>— Gang Members Include Soldiers and a Groom</p>
<p>Jin Shiyu, a detective from the French Concession Police, was shot and killed on the night of the 6th of this month while checking pedestrians on Avenue Joffre. A stray bullet also killed pedestrian Qian Achun. After investigation, the police arrested eight men and women, including the robber Wang Ziqing, and confiscated a Mauser pistol and bullets. They were sent to the Second Special District Court. The police charged them with murder under Article 282 of the Criminal Code and robbery under Article 346. After interrogation and detention, it was found that the defendants were soldiers in the Third Battalion of the Suzhou Military Police and had committed three robberies in Shanghai, as reported previously. Yesterday was the date for the third hearing in this case. At 11 AM, Judge Li Changnian, accompanied by Clerk Wu Shan, continued the hearing in the First Criminal Court. The testimony of the first defendant, Wang Ziqing, was previously reported and will not be repeated here. According to the second defendant, Wang Yousheng, he had no knowledge of the robberies of the Yuan family on Rue Sainte-Marie and the Zhou family on Zilaihuo Street. On the night of May 2nd, he, Wang Ziqing, and the fugitives Wang Guozhong and Li Shigen went to a butcher shop on Avenue Petain to rob it. Afterwards, they split the loot in Room 69 of Yipinxian Restaurant. He received nine yuan. On May 6th, he and the above-mentioned individuals planned to rob the Zhenhe Sauce Shop on Rue Sainte-Marie, but they did not dare to proceed because they saw patrolmen patrolling. They turned back and encountered the detective. Wang Ziqing opened fire first to resist arrest. He also fired one shot, fleeing east to the intersection of Rue Kloc, where he fired another shot, injuring the pedestrian Qian Achun. Afterwards, he fled to the Lin'an Hotel, where he saw Zhou Wenkui already inside, and Li Shigen also arrived. Li took the gun. He was arrested at midnight. The gun was given to him by Wang Guozhong. Zhou Wenkui, also known as Wang Juesheng, confessed to robbing the Yuan family on Shunqing Lane, Rue Sainte-Marie, and the butcher shop on Avenue Petain. On the night of May 6th, the fugitive Li Shigen invited him to the Great World, where he met with the fugitive Wang Guozhong and invited Wang Yousheng and Wang Ziqing to rob the Zhenhe Sauce Shop on Rue Sainte-Marie, but they were unsuccessful. They returned to the intersection of Rue du Consulat, encountered a detective checking them, and Wang Ziqing opened fire to resist arrest. He took the opportunity to flee to the Lin'an Hotel in the British Concession. Soon, Wang Yousheng and Li Shigen also arrived. Li hid the gun, hiding it on the roof. He was arrested at midnight. Wang Shujing, Liu Biao, and Zheng Chang testified that they were soldiers in the Third Battalion of the Central Military Police in Suzhou and were acquainted with the arrested defendants. On April 26th, the fugitive Wang Guozhong and the defendant Wang Ziqing came to Suzhou, inciting them to bring weapons to Shanghai. After agreeing, they gave Wang Guozhong one Mauser gun each on April 28th to take to Shanghai. On April 30th, they moved to the home of their acquaintance, Fu Shunqing (No. 2 Lanfangli, Zhaojiabang Road). At noon on May 3rd, Wang Guozhong distributed ten dollars and three cents each, claiming it was robbed from the butcher shop on Avenue Petain. They were arrested on the night of May 6th and knew nothing about the resistance to arrest. Fu Shunqing testified that he worked as a groom in the Third Battalion of the Military Police in Suzhou. Because he had not been paid for several months and his life was difficult, on April 30th, he and his wife, Pan, were invited to Shanghai by a friend in the Public Security Bureau to find work. They lived at No. 2 Lanfangli, Zhaojiabang Road. He had known Wang Ziqing, Wang Yousheng, and others for a long time. On the night of May 2nd, the fugitives Wang Guozhong and Li Shigen initiated the robbery of the butcher shop on Avenue Petain, gathering Wang Ziqing, Wang Yousheng, Zhou Wenkui, and others. Afterwards, Wang Ziqing invited him to Room 69 of Yipinxian Restaurant, where Wang Guozhong gave him nine yuan. He was arrested on the night of May 6th and knew nothing else. Pan testified that she knew nothing about the robberies. Zhou Rihu, who was injured by the stray bullet, testified that he was walking out of the entrance of Daodel Lane that night when he suddenly heard a gunshot and was shot in his left knee. He went to Renji Hospital for treatment and was later transferred to Guangci Hospital by the police. Although he can walk, he has not fully recovered. The victims, Yuan Zhoushi, Zhou Qiushi, and Fan Limai, testified about the circumstances of the robberies, but could not remember the faces of the robbers. The hearing was adjourned. The court will investigate and appoint defense counsel for further hearings. The defendants remain in custody.</p>

<p>Ye Zhangshi, a local woman with the nickname "Female Tiger," who lives at No. 4, Lane 454, Rue Conty in the French Concession and runs a boiled water stall and works as a matchmaker, was previously jealous that her husband's younger sister, Ye Ali, was getting married. The aunt, Ye Wangshi, prepared a generous dowry for the younger sister. Zhangshi demanded three thousand yuan from the aunt but was refused. Holding a grudge, she sneaked into her aunt's room one night while she was asleep and bit her aunt's lower body. The next morning, she burned all of the younger sister's wedding clothes. The case was reported to the police, who detained Zhangshi and sent her to the Second Special District Court. After investigation, Zhangshi was convicted of injuring a collateral relative and destruction of property and was sentenced to one year and two months of imprisonment.

The appellant remains in custody awaiting instructions.</p>
<h3>Anti-Opium Association</h3>
<h3>Encouragement for Lu Diping</h3>
<p>— Setting a Good Example to Urge Other Provinces</p>
<p>The Chinese National Anti-Opium Association recently received a report from Chen Lingyun, the Director-General of the Zhejiang Provincial Anti-Opium Association, stating that he had recently conducted a secret investigation in Zhejiang Province regarding the brewing of public opium sales. According to the investigation, although there are some unruly elements, corrupt officials, and local merchants in Zhejiang Province secretly active and vigorously promoting public opium sales, the Provincial Chairman, Lu Diping, has always advocated strict opium prohibition and resisted public opinion. He has stated to Chen that as long as he is in charge of Zhejiang, he will not allow the implementation of public opium sales. Therefore, the Anti-Opium Association sent a letter yesterday to encourage him and to urge him to persist without懈, setting a good example for other provinces. The original letter is transcribed as follows: [Respected Sir, Yesterday, Mr. Chen Lingyun, the Director-General of the Zhejiang Provincial Anti-Opium Association, came to Shanghai and reported to the association. We have long admired your lofty ideals and extraordinary vision, and your determination to strictly prohibit opium. Rumors have spread that Zhejiang Province is also secretly brewing the implementation of public opium sales. This is likely due to the activities of some unscrupulous individuals seeking to profit from the spread of poison, which is certainly not your intention. We are delighted to hear of your noble spirit. We have observed that Zhejiang Province has consistently been a leader in opium prohibition among the provinces of our country. Last year, when the central government planned to implement public opium sales, the Zhejiang provincial party, government, and people unanimously vowed to fight to the death, and the oppressive policy was cancelled. Zhejiang Province deserves the most credit for this achievement. Now that you are in charge of Zhejiang, you are not only maintaining the good governance of your predecessors but also striving for even greater achievements. Recently, you worked with the Provincial Anti-Opium Association to secretly investigate and eradicate opium seedlings in Ninghai, and you severely punished the county magistrate in one case. We have also heard that Zhejiang Province will take further steps to ban opium, which demonstrates your sincerity in prohibiting opium and not just making empty promises. Our association aims to eliminate drugs. We respect and protect all virtuous and capable officials who are seriously committed to prohibiting opium. We hope that you will continue to implement benevolent policies consistently, setting a good example for other provinces, and leading the way in banning opium and eliminating the scourge of drugs. Not only will the members of our association admire you, but the thirty million people of Zhejiang Province will also sing your praises for generations to come. We respectfully submit this letter and await your instructions. ]</p>
<h3>Rice Purchases Must Be Registered with the Social Affairs Bureau</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent a letter to the chambers of commerce of 22 counties, including Taixing, Jintan, Xinghua, Gaoyou, Tongshan, Nantong, Jiancheng, Liuhe, Danyang, Rugao, and Haimen, stating: [Respected Sirs, In recent times, various counties in the northern Jiangsu region have been experiencing food shortages. The local chambers of commerce, based on the requests of grain merchants, have requested the county governments or local chambers of commerce to issue passports for purchasing foreign rice in Shanghai. This process has historically involved a letter from your chamber to our chamber requesting the Shanghai Customs to verify and release the rice, and this has been done accordingly. However, according to Article 3 of the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau's regulations for registering applications for rice exports, if the local government issuing the passport has not directly notified our bureau in advance, the applicant must provide supporting documents from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the Grain Guild, or a certified public accountant. Therefore, counties purchasing rice should, on the one hand, have the county government issuing the passport directly notify the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau. On the other hand, the local chamber of commerce should send a letter with the passport to our chamber, which will then forward it to the Jianghai Customs Supervision Office for verification and release. The letter must state that the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau has been notified by the county government for verification and registration. This will expedite the process of application and transportation. We are sending this letter for your information and compliance.]</p>
<h3>Wusong Wing On Textile Mill</h3>
<h3>Resuming Operations Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Wing On No. 2 Textile Mill in Wusong, located west of the Yunzaobang Creek, has been closed for four months since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, resulting in significant losses. The remaining cotton and other goods that could not be evacuated were looted. The factory buildings were also severely damaged by gunfire. Therefore, the factory began hiring workers to repair the damage as soon as the armistice talks began. Currently, a portion of the new factory has been repaired and is scheduled to resume operations tomorrow (the 30th). The Japanese-owned Huafeng Textile Mill has also been recruiting workers in the factory recently and is expected to resume operations soon.</p>

<h3>A Cattle Lawsuit</h3>
<p>— Partnership Sours Mid-Course</p>
<p>— Both Criminal Lawsuits Deemed Unfounded</p>
<p>Shi Qixiang hired a lawyer to file a criminal lawsuit against his fellow villagers, Jin Rongfu, Yan Jinfu, and Hu Qingyu, for fraud and embezzlement in the First Special District Court. The defendants also hired lawyer Lin Yingqing to countersue him for false accusation. The facts are as follows: Yan Jinfu and the plaintiff are fellow villagers and were previously acquainted because they both had beef stalls at the Hongkou small vegetable market. Shi frequently bought beef from Yan. On February 25th of this year, Shi suddenly went to Yan's house and said that beef prices had recently soared, making it profitable to buy and sell cattle in the interior. He suggested going to the interior to buy cattle and sell them. Yan declined because he had not been in the beef business for many years and had no cash on hand. However, Shi vigorously persuaded him, saying that he could find a way to raise capital from Jin Rongfu. Jin was formerly an accountant at the Delong Beef Store and could surely raise funds. Yan, unable to resist his persistent persuasion, went to Jin to plead. Jin then borrowed one thousand dollars from a Mr. Chu at the Far Eastern Hotel. Shi and the defendants then took a ship to the eastern township of Ningbo but could not find any cattle to purchase. They telegraphed Yuyao and learned that Hu Qingyu was a cattle dealer. They entrusted him with gathering seven head of cattle, priced at $492.80, and paid an additional $23 for commission and food. They prepared to ship the cattle to Shanghai on the Xin Jiangtian ship. However, Jin and Yan did not know the regulations for shipping cattle and repeatedly requested the customs to issue export permits for the cattle. They were refused because cattle exports were prohibited. After joint discussion, Hu Qingyu said that it was also possible to transport the cattle to Shanghai by land, which would take about six days, but three people would need to be sent to escort them, costing about fifty yuan. They decided to send the cattle back to Yuyao and transport them to Shanghai by land. Jin Rongfu paid fifty yuan in advance, and the rest would be paid in Shanghai. The three of them then left for Shanghai together. They paid seven hundred sixty-five dollars and twenty cents for the cattle and all expenses. Shi also borrowed seventy yuan from Jin Rongfu. Unexpectedly, Jin later received a letter from Hu Qingyu, dated March 6th, stating that the cattle had been stopped by soldiers and had been taken back to Yuyao, either for raising or for sale. He requested a meeting in Yao. (Shi hid this letter.) At that time, he invited Shi and Yan to discuss the matter. They originally intended for Shi to go, but Shi was unwilling to go because he had other matters. The defendants went themselves. However, after arriving in Yao, they were told that the cattle had been seized by the soldiers and that the cattle and escorts were still missing. They also said that they had inquired in Hangzhou and that if they paid a fine, the cattle could be released. In a state of panic, the defendants returned to Ningbo to raise funds and sent a letter to Shi, reporting the information and instructing him to bring three hundred yuan to Hangzhou. However, this was ultimately abandoned. Because the cattle could not be transported to Shanghai, Hu sold them, resulting in a significant loss of four hundred sixty-seven yuan. Each person should bear their share of the loss. However, Shi later refused to pay, and when they urged him to pay, he became angry and filed a lawsuit accusing them of fraud and embezzlement. The court investigated the case and found that the circumstances were complicated and that both criminal lawsuits were unfounded. Therefore, Judge Qiao Wanxuan ruled that Jin Rongfu and Yan Jinfu were not guilty. The related civil suit was transferred to the civil court for trial. The proceedings against Hu Qingyu were suspended. The counterclaim by the defendant Shi Qixiang was rejected as well as the related requests of the original plaintiff. This cattle lawsuit has thus come to a temporary end.</p>

<h3>Good News for Scrofula Sufferers</h3>
<p>Mr. Qian Songxia, a scrofula expert from Wuxi, has been researching scrofula treatments for many years and has developed a new method to cure scrofula. Those he has treated have invariably recovered. Recently, Mr. Qian came to Shanghai to benefit people and visited Mr. Ding Fubao, hoping to promote his skills. Mr. Ding, recognizing his ambition to help the world, has temporarily kept him. However, skeptical of his miraculous formula, Mr. Ding personally supervised Mr. Qian and conducted practical experiments. After treating several people in succession and seeing them all recover quickly, he began to believe that Mr. Qian's claims were not false. Therefore, he decided to allow Mr. Qian to practice at No. 204 Medhurst Road, inside the Medical Bookstore. It is also reported that his treatment method is quite simple, without the need for surgery or medicine, causing no pain, and the treatment period is very fast. It is truly good news for scrofula sufferers.</p>

<h3>Hot Iron and Water Sores, Front Teeth and Military Service.</h3>
<p>When I first arrived in Shanghai, Western science was only just budding. I can say that I watched it develop. It's amazing, the development of science in these eighty years has been truly remarkable. Speaking of medicine, these eighty years have seen a leap forward that is inconceivable. At that time, the diagnostic methods used by the foreign doctors I saw were very rudimentary. For example, to treat water blisters, they would heat a branding iron red hot and then use it to cauterize the sores. Attacking heat with cold, and cold with heat, using poison to fight poison, the barbarity of the method was really no different from that of Chinese itinerant doctors. Speaking of military weapons, they were also very rudimentary. I still remember when teachers from the Xuhui Public School led us to visit foreign warships docked in Shanghai. At that time, the machinery on the warships was very simple, there was nothing much, and the application of electricity was completely absent. The guns on the ships could neither be raised nor lowered, nor could they be rotated left or right, and they had no accuracy. They were really not much different from Chinese earth cannons.</p>
<p>At that time, rifles were still muzzle-loading. There were no hard-cased bullets like today. The gunpowder was still wrapped in paper, and you had to bite open the paper with your teeth before placing it in the barrel, pushing it in with a tube, and then firing. To fire a gun like this, you had to have a set of sharp teeth. Otherwise, before you even felt the soreness of holding the gun, your jawbone would be aching. So, it's funny, when France first introduced conscription, young people were afraid of military service. Many people knocked out their front teeth to avoid being drafted, because at that time, if your front teeth were damaged, you were not fit for military service.</p>
<h3>The Little Five-Year Plan for Russian Children</h3>
<p>— Chen Zhengfan</p>
<p>Soviet Russia is a brand new and most promising country in the modern world. Today, all of their people are busy with one task, which is to complete the Five-Year Plan, which has national defense implications. Within five years, they are planning to build a certain number of railways, open a certain number of factories, reclaim a certain number of wastelands, and establish a certain number of schools. Because of the genuine efforts of the entire nation (not efforts of pasting slogans and shouting slogans,) many aspects of this Five-Year Plan have already been successful, and many others are close to success. All the countries of the world are admiring them. Russian children are all small socialist soldiers, and they are also doing their best to help the country and engage in construction. The following is the Little Five-Year Plan for Russian children. (1) To discover geological layers of limestone and phosphorus for use as fertilizer. (2) Each child must collect at least 20 kilograms of old items each year, such as rags, ropes, wool, bones, metal scraps, etc., to supply factories for use as raw materials. (3) To manufacture wireless telephone boxes and loudspeakers. Within five years, 75,000 wireless telephone boxes should be installed in rural areas nationwide, and every school should have a loudspeaker wireless telephone. (4) To select excellent seeds from grains in the state farms. (5) Each child must collect at least two tons of field fertilizer ash each year. (6) Each child must kill at least ten field mice each year, clear 1,000 cubic meters of land infested with parasites, eradicate pests on one tree and ten vegetable plants, and kill five large rats and ten small rats. (7) Each child must build one bird-snaring house (to catch harmful birds) and two bird-feeding houses (to protect beneficial birds) each year. Within five years, the number of bird-snaring houses across the country must be increased to 1.5 million, and the number of bird-feeding houses to 1 million. (8) To organize 5,000 children's bird-raising associations and establish 5,000 cooperative poultry farms (raising chickens, ducks, etc.) and build 5,000 chicken coops within five years. (9) Each child must help one farming household increase one pair of good egg-laying hens each year. (10) Each child must plant ten trees each year. Within five years, a children's forest with 75 million trees should be established across the country. (11) Each child must exterminate bedbugs, oil bugs, and flies, and clean ten houses each year. (12) To help adults become literate, and to eliminate literary Chinese across the country within five years. Alas! Where is the Five-Year Plan for Chinese children? Where is the Five-Year Plan for Chinese adults? Where is the Five-Year Plan for the Chinese government? (Yet to be repaid)</p>
<h3>Kitchen Brawl</h3>
<p>— Tao Zaidong</p>
<p>Wensheng said impolitely. A full banquet of Manchu and Han dishes. It is better to send it to a distant neighbor than to a close relative. Close relatives are gluttonous and ruthless, wiping everything clean. Distant neighbors are more polite, even when full. It is better to send it to many families than to one. One family devours it all, with no kickbacks. Under the equilibrium of many families, there are leaks, and one can intercept it. Young man angrily said, A good banquet, can't you enjoy it yourself? Why talk nonsense about sending it to close relatives or distant neighbors? Wensheng said, A banquet, ah. It is only passed in principle. The menu proposal is still being drafted. In other words, it is only a banquet for propaganda, not a banquet for construction. To be honest, delicacies from the mountains are still in the mountains, and treasures from the sea are still in the sea. The existing materials are only chicken, duck, fish, and meat. Young man's expression softened a little and said, Make do with it. Please ask the chef to make it. Wensheng said, It is easy to say, but difficult to do. At first, the chef is corrupt. The fish is overfed and the meat is spoiled. Shaoxing fermented tofu and incubated eggs are foul and unbearable. Secondly, the chef becomes malicious. The shark fin with hair standing on end in anger, the duck with too much wine and lust, cannot be eaten. These corrupt and malicious elements should of course be overthrown. Experts are hired, without regard to faction, bringing together talents. Who knew it would be even worse. The Sichuan chef favors spiciness. Everything is terribly spicy. The Cantonese chef favors sweetness. There is no dish without honey. Sweetness is also hard to bear. The Beijing chef advocates eating. Steamed buns and sesame cakes are solid.</p>

<h3>Reading the Society Stele in Dafeng Hall (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Zizai</p>
<p>After a long time, his friend Li Wenjie, whose courtesy name was Ruiqing and who was known as Qingdaoren, was practicing calligraphy in Shanghai, barely making a living. He wrote a letter to Gu, inviting him to join him, saying, "Living at home is mundane, why not come and share a common fate with me?" Thus, Gu went to serve Qingdaoren. Gu's calligraphy shared the same origins as Qingdaoren's, both striving to revive antiquity, studying Qin and Han seal script, and then specializing in Six Dynasties steles, mastering their essence. After Qingdaoren passed away, Gu continued his work, and his reputation grew. People from all over the world valued his work and sought it out incessantly. Each year's earnings were used to help poor relatives, friends, and clan members. Gu was extremely filial to his mother, and throughout his life, whenever he spoke of his mother's protection and defense against bullying when he was an infant, he could not help but shed tears. He chose a burial site for Qingdaoren at Niushou Mountain in Jinling, built a shrine, and established sacrificial fields. People particularly admired his character. In Shanghai, he lived in a secluded alley, but his guests or disciples often filled his seat. He had an ancient face and a white beard, and he spoke earnestly and sincerely, so many people were drawn to him. In his later years, he enjoyed purchasing the remnants of his predecessors' works. In his spare time, he would imitate them to the best of his ability. One day, I visited him, and he had hung a self-painted ink landscape in his study, mixed among the works of Qingxiang, Shitao, and others. I mistakenly praised it alongside them. Gu stroked his beard and laughed heartily, saying, "Can this old man's humble ink play really fool you?" I immediately admitted my mistake. He waved his hand and said, "You must not say it's a mistake." His humor and eccentricity were like this. Gu passed away from illness on July 4th of the gengwu year [1930], at the age of seventy. His works include "Gu's Questions and Answers" in ten volumes, "Chronological Table of Major Events in the Spring and Autumn Period" in two volumes, "Chronological Table of Emperors of Past Dynasties" in two volumes, "Poems Harmonizing with Tao Yuanming" in two volumes, and various volumes of calligraphy records and literary collections. His late father's name was so-and-so, and his late grandfather's name was Ji-yin. His talent's name was Guangju. His late mother, Ms. Liu, was commended for her chastity and filial piety, and the National History Museum wrote her biography. He was married to the Gongren of the Tang family. They had sons named Zhi, Shu, and Zhuo, and two daughters, who married Tan and Xia. He was subsequently married to the Gongren of the Wan family. They had a son named Xianke. He had grandnephews and grandnieces. He was buried in Tangchong, Pihuantang, in Hengyang County in September of that year. His orphaned son Zhi went to Mount Kuanglu to request an epitaph. I was one of Gu's closest friends during his life. I have compiled details of his life that have not been mentioned and have written the following eulogy: Driven by chaos, an old man fled to a coastal exile. Skillfully saving his hungry stomach by selling his art. Initially, he joined the ranks of yellow-robed Daoists. After the death of his friend, his literary talent alone illuminated the world. His flowing beard saw the years pass in a mirage. Countless spirits surged to serve the old man. His moral character was rooted in filial piety. The ink traces conceal the tears of remembering his mother. The Way survives, and his life is revered for its high ideals. Whose posterity can inherit the lasting legacy of his influence? His soul merges with the Qi of the mountains, and a single stone marks his burial. The sound of poems guides the determination of his will. Seasoning. People shout, "I'm stuffed to death!" A Ningbo chef said, "Chinese cuisine is not in line with the trend. Our First Spring Western food is good." A Suzhou cook said. The eclectic school also shouts slogans with a cry. Chinese food is eaten in the Western style. The chef who sings high notes says, "The heavenly kitchen, the heavenly taste, the fragrance, and all kinds of solemnity." Opinions differ. The arguments are different. The host is about to entertain guests and arrange seats. Suddenly, a loud noise erupts from the kitchen. The chefs are fighting. But all you see is the Northern faction chef wielding a rolling pin and advancing. The Southern faction chef brandishes a wok as a last-ditch effort. The Border faction chef defends themselves with a water vat. In the end, the female cook, a woman, leads her little maids and shortens the front line for an orderly retreat. The odd-jobbers take advantage of the situation and throw sneak punches. The accountant takes the opportunity to inflate the bills. At that time, the pots and pans are overturned, the bowls and dishes fly horizontally. A fierce battle. Guests come from the hungry ghost path and want to taste a piece of meat. One guest even plays rogue, forcibly robbing the steamed buns, and implementing the collapse of the stove. The host cries out in pain and has to protest to the guests, saying that the honored guests must take responsibility, because everyone said before that the integrity of the kitchen must be preserved.</p>
<h3>Record of the Double Buildings Amidst War (66)</h3>
<p>— Master of the Seeking Happiness Studio</p>
<p>Chapter 8: Endless Grief in Repentance, Difficult to Achieve Optimism - Extreme Sounds and Songs for Pleasure, One Gets to See Authority</p>
<p>However, his changing clothes was much easier than Liang Xiaoyun's makeup. After changing very quickly, fearing that there might still be something inappropriate, he especially invited Liang Xiaoyun, the newly hired professional teacher, to come in and inspect it first. After all, she had piercing eyes and special expertise. After just one look, she pointed out that his leather shoes were not suitable and that he should change into a pair of silk shoes with Liang brand white soles and a pair of white silk socks. After he had changed his shoes and socks, she ordered him to stay in the study and accompany the hairy-handed Deputy Mao. No matter what he did, since he was wearing the shoulder boards of a captain in the military and was a favorite of the Fifth Madam, he should treat him with courtesy for the sake of his master. He should never be as rigid and uncooperative as before. He should not annoy such petty people. It should be known that it would be most important to use them to seek all kinds of conveniences in the future. Being an official is like acting. It would not be a loss to treat him as a brother. Although An Yutian was reluctant, he dared not openly disobey. He had no choice but to wrong himself and reluctantly put on a false face to appease Mao Deshun. Unfortunately, it was easy to fake a polite smile, but it was more difficult than writing an article to come up with a set of mindless nonsense to kill this long time. It was difficult to squeeze out so much to pass the time. He barely endured a great deal of embarrassment and waited for Liang Xiaoyun to finish her makeup and walk over with a smile. She relieved him of a heavy burden and pulled Mao Deshun into the car together. Because Mao Deshun was admirably modest and knew his place, he repeatedly refused to sit side-by-side with them in the carriage. He jumped to the seat next to the chauffeur at the front of the car. He still let the two of them nestle closely together, as if glued together. Liang Xiaoyun took the opportunity to give instructions and teach An Yutian that when he met Commander Ye later, he should not panic or be too restrained. He should be bold and talk freely and show off his competence. People like Old Ye have a rough nature. They only like people who are quick-witted and hate those who are coy and pedantic. When you meet him for the first time, it is best to impress him immediately. An Yutian thought that this was another difficult problem. He really could not say that he was confident that he could definitely do it well. It could be seen that his usual self-proclaimed extraordinary was really ignorant and arrogant. Now, he was only bowing his head and doing despicable and shameless things, and he was already completely lost and could not find the slightest clue. He was more naive than a primary school student. How could he be considered to have any experience or ability? From now on, he would follow her step by step, learning one step at a time, feeling his way along the wall. He would try to do things as he went along. He did not dare to say that he would learn everything perfectly.</p>

As for the silver market, it continued to decline, initially opening higher, exceeding 730 taels. However, news emerged that a large quantity of gold coins was being shipped from the United States to France, causing unease among investors. This made the market weak, almost as if a mountain was collapsing or the sea was overturning. Moreover, the differences between spot and forward prices became more pronounced, turning firm positions into deficits. The selling pressure in the market increased, with major players tending to sell, causing the price to plummet by more than ten taels. The downward trend was uncontrollable, eventually breaking through 720 taels. In the afternoon, due to Saturday's market closure and the chaotic situation throughout the week, large trades initially appeared to be bottoming out but then surged, briefly reaching 733.5 taels. Subsequently, the market entered a period of consolidation. However, due to the complexity of the news, dealers were indecisive. At the end of the week, a sudden surge occurred, turning from bullish to bearish, abruptly falling to 718.3 mace, primarily influenced by unfavorable news from the gold market. Over the six days, the fluctuations totaled 15.2 mace, with a net decrease of slightly less than one tael. Dealers like Qian Changxiang, Yifeng Yong, and the Dalian gang were mostly bullish, while short positions were mainly held by smaller players, including Yuan Mao Yong, Da De Cheng, and others. The trading volume among dealers slightly increased compared to the previous period, estimated at 19,000 contracts. A summary of yesterday's market conditions is recorded below.</p>
<p>▲ Opening Higher but a Significant Drop Midway: The July contract opened at 732.5 taels, up 6.1 mace, due to the further decline of large trades by one-eighth and silver prices by one-quarter. With the continuous drop in silver futures prices, it increased to 33 taels. Yuan Mao Yong, Heng Yu Yu He, and others were the first to enter the market, followed by Zhifeng Yong, Hong Kang Yong, Fu Chang, Yuan Heng, and others, who invested heavily, immediately devaluing by three taels. The August U.S. dollar settlement price was $0.875, and the September English gold price from Mumbai was 93.75 to 8 pence. At around 9:20 AM, it was 30 taels. When the English gold price was announced, the U.S. dollar price decreased by 1.25, reaching 31 taels. Suddenly, news circulated that Citibank had $100 million ounces of cash being shipped to France, causing turmoil in the market. Yuan Heng, Tong Tai Chang, Hong Kang Yong, Heng Yu, Yuan Tai, Wan Xing, and others rushed to sell, dropping 3-4 taels. Around 10:00 AM, it was 27.5 taels, with Heng Yu and arbitrageurs entering the market. Huabi and others absorbed the September U.S. dollar at $1.875, and Hua Shang Bank traded spot U.S. dollars at $0.625, pulling it up by more than one tael to 29.2 mace. Afterwards, selling intensified, with Fu Xing Yong, Da De Cheng, Fu Tai Heng, Yuan Heng, Xie Xing Yong, Fu Yu, Hong Kang Yong, and others unloading their positions, causing the price to drop by more than four taels. From 10:20 AM to 11:00 AM, the trading volume was just over one tael. As the exchange rate gradually eased, the September English gold traded at 8 pence, and the July price was 93.75, while the U.S. dollar July price was $0.875 to $31. At 11:00 AM, it was 24.5 taels, with the Daxia gang taking the opportunity to enter, adding 1.5 taels to 26 taels. Subsequently, the selling pressure increased. General major players, including Da De Cheng, Yuan Tai, Qian Chang Xiang, Fu Xing Yong, Ri Chang, Yuan Heng, Da Xing Yong, Fu Yu, Zhi Feng Yong, and speculators, vigorously sold off. The recent U.S. dollar settlement price was particularly weak at $0.8125, and selling the September contract to banks required $31.5, causing the gold price to plummet by eight taels, continuously declining with only a one-tael fluctuation. At the 12:00 PM close, it was 18.3 mace. Bing Xing, Yuan Mao Yong, and Yu He persistently sold, pushing the price down by another two mace to around 16 taels. Yifeng Yong and Shunli and others bought in, momentarily rebounding by two taels but remaining above 18 taels. The market situation was chaotic and difficult to predict, down 8.1 mace compared to the previous day (according to the listed price).</p>
<p>▲ Listed Price Suppressed by Eighty Taels: The highest price during the half-day was 33.5 taels, and the lowest was 18.3 mace, a difference of over 14.7 mace. The listed price was changed to 800 taels, suppressed by 70-80 taels. The book entry was 21-18 taels, with a water supplement of 21 taels. The red bar added 8.25 taels.</p>
<p>▲ Extremely Busy Trading: On the surface, selling dominated. However, Yuan Mao Yong, Shunli, Wan Xing, Yifeng Yong, and arbitrageurs all bought in. Tong Tai Chang, Zhi Feng Yong, Yuan Heng, Fu Chang, Heng Xing, Bing Xing, Yu He, Hong Kang Yong, Yuan Tai, Fu Yu, Yong Feng, Fu Tai Heng, Fu Xing Yong, Xie Xing Yong, and others all sold. Heng Yu, Da De Cheng, Qian Chang Xiang, Tong Chun, Yuan Chun, and Zai Shun were buying and selling rapidly, which was very busy. Speculators also unloaded. The Dalian gang bought over 1,800 contracts and sold over 700 contracts. The Guangdong gang sold a small amount.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Tight in the Morning, Loose in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>— Chinese Merchants Settle First, Then Dump</p>
<p>— Swap Rates Looser Further Out</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silver market continued to decline, and the exchange rate trended differently. The British and American exchange rates fell, then rebounded. By the time HSBC posted its rates, they had all dropped by half a point, with British gold down 0.125 (one shilling and seven and a half pence). The American exchange rate only dropped 0.125, or 30 yuan, due to the large exchange rate spread. Hong Kong did not change, remaining at 77.25 taels. The Indian exchange rate decreased by 0.075, and the French franc slightly decreased by 5 yuan. The German exchange rate only decreased by half a mark, and the Dutch exchange rate decreased by 0.025. The Singapore dollar, however, increased by one tael. These were the bank's transaction prices, tight in the morning and loose in the afternoon. This was mainly influenced by a Reuters report that Citibank was shipping a large number of gold coins to France, which led to concerns about the appreciation of British and American exchange rates. The gold market was also stimulated, breaking through 720 taels. By the afternoon closing, compared to the previous night, British gold was up 0.125 and American gold was up 0.25, almost completely reversing the morning trend. Banks actively traded, with approximately 100,000 pounds of British gold traded. Mumbai telegraphed forward sales, and HSBC sold in interbank transactions. Japanese banks bought. There were few transactions among dealers. Approximately 500,000-600,000 yuan of American gold was traded. Chinese merchants settled early and then dumped, with supply exceeding demand. There were some arbitrage trades, but the settlement price was suppressed by over 80 taels. The market closed in the afternoon because it was Saturday.</p>
<p>▲ British Exchange Rate: There was a difference of 0.125 in intraday trading. Early selling prices were approximately one shilling, seven and seven-eighths to eight pence. Buying prices were one shilling, seven and thirteen-sixteenths to eight and one-sixteenth pence. Maihang bought August at one shilling and thirteen-sixteenths (all Mumbai orders). Sumitomo bought September at one shilling and eight pence (all Mumbai orders). HSBC sold, and Zhengjin bought August at one shilling and thirteen-sixteenths. Zhejiang and Sumitomo traded September at one shilling and eight pence. HSBC and Zhongfa traded September at one shilling and eight pence. Taiwan and Korea traded at the same price. Huabi and Holland also traded at the same price. Guangdong and Zhejiang traded July at one shilling and thirteen-sixteenths. The afternoon closing selling price was one shilling and eight pence to one and one-eighth pence. The buying price was one shilling and eight and one-sixteenth to three-thirty-seconds pence. The swap rate difference was 0.125, remaining firmer in the near term and looser further out.</p>
<p>▲ American Exchange Rate: The intraday swing was 0.4375. Early morning selling prices were approximately 30.375 yuan for the current month, 30.4375 yuan for June, 30.0625 yuan for July, 30.75 yuan for August, and 30.9375 yuan for September. Buying prices were 0.125 higher for each month. Zhejiang and Maihang sold August at 30.875 yuan. Huabi sold 30.9375 yuan. They also bought September at 31.1875 yuan with Taiwan. Shanghai and Zhongfu traded spot contracts at 30.625 yuan. Maihang and Dongya bought June at 30.6875 yuan. Shanghai and Huabi traded July at 30.875 yuan. Hefeng and Zhengjin traded October at 31.3125 yuan. Mitsui bought September at 31.25 yuan. The afternoon closing selling prices were 30.8125 yuan for the current month, 30.875 yuan for June, 31 yuan for July, 31.1875 yuan for August, and 31.375 yuan for September. The buying prices were 30.9375 yuan for the current month and 31.5 yuan for September. The swap rate difference between May and June was 0.0625, 0.125 between June and July, and 0.1875 between July, August, and September, indicating an increasingly looser trend further out. The listed exchange rate was one yuan equals 3.3333 taels of silver.</p>

<h3>Constant Discovery of Copper Cash</h3>
<h3>Unprecedented Low Price</h3>
<p>— 6 Candareens, 9 Fens, 7 Lis</p>
<p>Market Overview: Yesterday's trading of silver coins in the market was slightly less active compared to the previous day. However, with the market price of silver coins continuing to decline, new unprecedented lows were repeatedly set. This frequent downward trend, without any end in sight, is feared to lead to a decline in the economy. However, there are no good solutions to stop it. The silver supply remained stable, while the settlement situation was sparse and not busy, as is customary on weekends. Subsidiary currencies generally declined as well, following the decrease in the price of silver coins.</p>
<p>▲ Prices of Coins: [Silver Coins] In the morning, silver coins reached an unprecedented low price of 6 candareens, 9 fens, 9 lis, 1 hao, 2 sis and 5 hus, which was 0.00375 lower than the previous record low (April 27). Unexpectedly, the afternoon market suddenly plummeted by more than 0.02 candareens, reaching only 6 candareens, 9 fens, and 7 lis, setting a new record low, which can be described as a drastic change in the market. [Silver Fractions] The morning and afternoon markets continued to trade at 0.07 candareens, without any premium or water, and the situation was similar to the previous day.</p>
<p>▲ Subsidiary Currency Market Conditions: The Jiangnan small silver coins have always had low trading volume and weak competition, so they were generally stable without much change. Yesterday, the price was slightly improved by 0.005 candareens to 0.0606 candareens, the same in both the morning and afternoon. The trading volume was 3,000 jiao in the morning and 1,500 jiao in the afternoon. Due to the sharp decline in silver coins, Guangdong small silver coins also followed suit, with the morning market at 0.059525 candareens and the afternoon market at 0.05935 candareens. The trading volume was 115,000 jiao in the morning and 40,000 jiao in the afternoon. The price of copper coins decreased by 1,000 wen to 420,000 wen, and the trading volume was 37,800 strings.</p>
<p>▲ Silver and Silver Coin Inflow and Outflow: [Silver] Yesterday, due to it being Saturday, banks closed early in the afternoon, and the settlement was simpler. Foreign banks settled over 2.1 million in bills, over 2 million in various foreign exchange and miscellaneous items, and withdrew 200,000. Chinese banks settled over 2.6 million in various items, over 4.5 million in various foreign exchange, tax, and miscellaneous items, over 3 million in current accounts, and withdrew 400,000. Money shops and silver guilds settled over 22 million in bills, over 3.8 million in premiums, over 1.1 million in remittances from various locations, and received 400,000-500,000 in cash. [Silver Coins] The exchange bill market saw 895,000 in the morning and 555,000 in the afternoon. Banknotes were 40,000 in the morning and 35,000 in the afternoon. The over-the-counter banknotes were 102,000 in the morning and 75,000 in the morning. 100,000 branch notes in the morning and 30,000 in the afternoon. Interbank trading was 800,000 in the morning and 500,000 in the afternoon. Silver coin remittances and settlements were over 1.5 million, banknote inflows and outflows were over 1.4 million. Money shops settled over 6.5 million in bills, over 2.1 million in premiums. The inflow and outflow of loans was over 1.8 million. Small money shops traded 400,000-500,000. The amount of remittances from customers was not detailed.</p>
<h3>Securities</h3>
<h3>Bond Prices Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>— Up About Half a Yuan Compared to Pre-Delivery</p>
<p>— Only One Type of Military Reduction Contract Opened for July</p>
<p>Yesterday (May 28), the Chinese Securities Exchange reopened. Although the July futures contract was opened for trading, only the military reduction contract saw trading of 5,000 yuan; other contracts saw no trading. Therefore, the futures market effectively only had the June contract trading. The turnover for the morning session was nearly 1 million yuan, and 800,000 yuan for the afternoon session, totaling 1.785 million yuan. Among them, salt tax contracts accounted for about 300,000 yuan, while others only accounted for 100,000-200,000 yuan. Spot trading was active, with a total turnover of 67,000 yuan. 20-coupon bonds accounted for 20,000 yuan, while others ranged from 5,000 to 10,000 yuan. In terms of changes in bond prices, although the market was relatively calm and large-scale transactions were rare, the bond market outlook was still good. Small investors continued to buy in, and demand was active, so prices consistently trended upwards. Among them, spot prices for domestic consolidated tax bonds rose by 1.135 yuan, and other bonds also increased by several jiao to 0.8-0.9 yuan. The overall market situation seemed to be favorable.</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Weekly Review</h3>
<p>— Report from American Eastern Silver Company</p>
<p>In the New York stock market this week, the first two days were marked by sluggishness and extremely weak trading activity. By Wednesday, bulls were eager to sell, leading to a significant increase in trading volume and a unanimous drop in prices. Thursday saw a slight pause, as economic news was quiet and the market cooled down again. Many traders turned to short-selling. The initial price drop on Tuesday was due to a decrease in railway freight and a dim outlook for the tobacco industry. The weakness of the railway industry further contributed to the price drop on Wednesday. The subsequent rebound on Thursday was due to the tax bill being submitted to Congress for discussion. On Friday, due to the reduction of dividends from various enterprises and the lack of progress on the implementation of the sales tax, the stock market plummeted again. The overall decline this week was unprecedented in recent weeks. One event of economic significance this week was President Hoover's efforts on the sales tax issue, including meeting with journalists, consulting with the UK, and lobbying in Congress. The sentiment in the market is still heavily influenced by news from Washington, and the future may become clearer. The Dow Jones index is attached below:</p>
<p>May 21, May 27</p>
<p>30 Industrials: 53.04, 47.47, Down 5.57</p>
<p>20 Railroads: 17.40, 15.37, Down 2.03</p>
<p>20 Utilities: 21.76, 19.04, Down 2.72</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<h3>Yarn Market Relatively Stable</h3>
<p>— Trading Volume Remains Dull</p>
<p>Actual sales of cotton yarn remain good, and the market sentiment is relatively stable. Because various parties previously purchased a large quantity, the amount of inventory in each factory is less than before. It is said that Shenxin Factory is already shipping and selling to various locations in large quantities, making spot goods in Shanghai increasingly tight. As a result, the yarn market is firmer, and investor sentiment is slightly optimistic. However, the silver supply is still difficult to return to its previous relaxed state, and the purchasing power of merchants is weak. Recently, purchases from South China continue unabated, but North China has long been occupied by Japanese yarn, and there is little hope for local yarn. The Yangtze River region feels increasingly depressed. It is found that except for the South, the sales volume in other regions is limited, and the widespread banditry in all directions makes it impossible to predict the future situation.</p>
<p>▲ Man-Made Bids Up by 7-8 Qian: The opening of the man-made bid market was supported by good demand for current yarn, resulting in more buyers in the market. Prices for various months rose by 0.05, 0.07, and 0.09 qian. In the afternoon, market sentiment remained firm, and prices for various months rose by another 0.01-0.02 qian, but trading volume remained low. It was found that Jifeng sold 400 bales, Dafeng 150 bales, Mingde 200 bales, Yichang 200 bales, Changji 350 bales, and Ruidai 250 bales. Rongxing bought 250 bales, Dachangcheng 600 bales, Changfeng 700 bales, Shenji 600 bales, and Xincheng 250 bales. The total trading volume for the day was 4,600 bales. The closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Man-Made Bids Closing Prices, Change, Inventory</p>
<p>September 15.52, Up 0.08, 22,600</p>
<p>July 15.47, Up 0.07, 15,250</p>
<p>October 15.54, Up 0.08, 25,550</p>
<p>August 15.51, Up 0.07, 21,700</p>
<p>Total 85,100</p>
<p>▲ Yarn Sales 1,300 Bales: The offloading of current yarn is still good. It was found that various parties bought a total of 1,300 bales for the day. 25 bales were traded among peers. The market was stable. Guangdong merchants bought 785 bales, inland merchants 60 bales, Shantou 220 bales, Nanyang 50 bales, Xiamen 23 bales, Yunnan 40 bales, North merchants 15 bales, Zhenjiang 10 bales, Xuzhou 30 bales, Nanjing 7 bales, and Sichuan 70 bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Without Much Rise or Fall</h3>
<p>The cotton market is calm and the trend is stable. There was no significant rise or fall throughout the day, and the fluctuations were minimal. The market was sluggish and inactive. However, the decline of foreign cotton has disappointed actual demand. Yet, general retail investors, due to the abnormal climate in the country and the rain in Hankou, are increasingly bullish, but business in the market remains rare. Judging from the overall trend, it is still in a stagnant state.</p>
<p>▲ Zheng Biao Deeply Implies a Calm and Stable Tone: The opening of the Zheng Biao market was uneventful. Due to the weakness of foreign cotton, prices fell by 0.05 yuan. The afternoon remained flat, with prices rising by 0.05 yuan in the far term. The total trading volume for the day was 6,400 dan. It was found that Meiji sold 400 dan, Yidai 300 dan, Yuandai 300 dan, Yongdai 300 dan, Tongfu 200 dan, and Mingde 300 dan. Changhe bought 600 dan, Senkang 400 dan, Changfeng 500 dan, and Xinheng 400 dan. The closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Closing Prices, Change, Inventory</p>
<p>October 32.65, Up 0.05, 61,200</p>
<p>July 32.25, Down 0.03, 41,100</p>
<p>Total 160,700</p>
<p>August 32.60, Up 0.05, 57,400</p>
<p>▲ Factory Demand Presents an Extreme Degree of Stagnation: The current cotton business has been cut off. Because the American and Indian cotton markets are declining, no one dares to try rashly. Therefore, demand remains as sluggish as ever.</p>
<h3>American Cotton Merchants Dump Forward Contracts</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market was calm, but it suddenly declined due to the weakness of Wall Street and the dumping of forward contracts by manufacturers. Futures fell by 0.07 to 0.10 pounds per point, and spot prices fell by 0.05 pounds per point. British cotton futures rose by 4-5 points, and spot prices rose by 4 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices did not change. Indian cotton was weak due to the liquidation of long positions, with Pingguoer down 2.25 rupees and Bailuoxi down 3.25 rupees. The original telegraph record is on the left (telegram from the 27th):</p>

<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<h3>New Cocoons from Chang'an Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Poor Quality Cocoons... Shanghai Silk Merchants Purchase Very Little</p>
<p>This year's spring silkworm production in the villages near Chang'an was severely affected by the weather, resulting in a drastic reduction in cocoon production. The total output was less than one-third of a normal year. Only one silk merchant from Shanghai, Mr. Tang, went to rent a shop to collect cocoons. Due to the poor quality of the cocoons, the amount purchased was very small, only about two to three hundred dan of new cocoons. They were transported to Shanghai yesterday and were estimated to weigh 312 jin after drying. They have now been sent to the factory for reeling to determine the size of the reeling loss.</p>
<h3>Foreign Tea Market: Black Tea Firm, Green Tea Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign market for Qihong and other black teas continued to be brisk. Jardine Matheson resumed operations, further strengthening investor sentiment. The top-quality tea from each plantation opened at 200 taels outside the Customs, and the market was very active. However, green tea remained quiet. Although Jardine Matheson, Yongxing, Yuan and others bought small quantities of needle and eyebrow green teas from local plantations, the selling price was already down by 5-6 taels compared to before. Moreover, the Zhenmei variety remained stagnant, and the top-quality bud tea from each plantation was even less sought after. Seeing this situation, Chinese tea merchants have already sent large telegrams to stop shipments from various locations in order to avoid losses.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Foreign Tea Merchants Association</h3>
<h3>Resolves to Suspend Child Tea for One Year</h3>
<p>The autumn black tea from Qifu arrived in Shanghai for sampling. Nearly 300 characters were created within five days, but the market has not yet opened. The future is very dangerous. The Shanghai Foreign Tea Merchants Association unanimously resolved on the 19th of this month to suspend the production of child tea for one year to provide relief. If any tea company ships child tea to Shanghai, the warehouses will not sell it and will confiscate the child tea for charitable purposes. If any tea warehouse privately displays child tea, it will be fined 2,000 taels of silver. Even after the fine is paid, the warehouse will still not be allowed to sell Qifu autumn child tea.</p>
<h3>Anhui Foreign Tea Tax</h3>
<h3>Handling According to the Precedent of the 19th Year [of the Republic]</h3>
<p>The tea tax from the Western-style tea firms belonging to Huizhou [present-day Anhui Province] is a significant source of revenue for Anhui Province. Since the abolition of the Likin Bureau and Regular Customs two years ago, the tea tax of each county is collected by the business tax authorities, with a fixed rate of 5% of the value. This year, the Anhui Provincial Government has specifically designated tea and wood as special tax items and has established special tea business tax bureaus in each county. The tax rate on boxed tea has been changed to 20% of the value. Huizhou tea merchants, feeling the burden is too heavy, have repeatedly telegraphed the Ministry of Finance requesting a reduction. The Ministry of Finance has now approved the tea merchants' request and ordered the Anhui Finance Department to consider reducing the tax. The tax bureaus in each county have received a telegram from the Wuhu General Bureau ordering that this year's tea tax will still be handled according to the precedent of the 19th year, with a tax of one yuan, one jiao, two fen, and five li per hundred jin. All procedures for removing the outer packaging and weighing the boxes will be as before. After receiving the order, each tax bureau has sent letters to the various tea trade associations to inform the tea merchants to comply.</p>
<h3>Grains</h3>
<h3>Rice Market Universally Trending Upward</h3>
<p>*   South Shanghai: Yesterday, the number of incoming shipments from various sources was about sixteen or seventeen. The outgoing traffic in the main street market felt more active before and after. The Suzhou and Tongzhou rice brokers were quoting two jiao higher. There were not many shipments of Nantong thin paddy rice. The Ningbo and Shaoxing rice dealers had a slight response, and the situation was tight. The price of "Lu Yang Jian" [a type of rice] for direct sale was slightly firmer. A small amount of early indica rice and white rice slightly increased the stock, about several hundred dan, with a firm opening price. In the morning and afternoon markets, about two thousand shi of "Pu Jiang Hu Jiao" [another type of rice] were traded.</p>
<p>▲ North Shanghai: Yesterday, the weather was intermittently cloudy and sunny. The number of incoming shipments from inland areas was less than twenty. The sales in various districts were quite brisk in the morning, but sluggish in the afternoon. The price of northern japonica rice rose another two jiao. The arrival of early and late indica rice was scarce, and the price gradually increased. The price of "Yang Lu Jian" rice was high due to its scarcity.</p>
<p>Converting Silver Dollars: The sales of grain stores were quite good, increasing by one or two jiao. Foreign rice from the Hansi region continued to sell. The main street market followed suit, leading to a further increase in price. Yesterday, the rice merchants' association decided to suspend the market for three days from the 30th of this month, and to resume operations as usual on June 2nd.</p>
<h3>Siamese Futures Rice</h3>
<h3>Newly Fixed at One Thousand Tons</h3>
<p>— Buyer Activity Very Strong, Prices Rising Universally</p>
<p>— Jiangxi Machine Rice Continues to Arrive in Port</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market was very active. Inland merchants had better business due to smooth transportation of goods. There were also inquiries from Nanjing and Jiangbei. The demand along the Yangtze River was also good, but due to flooding in the upper reaches, there were no large-scale sales. Most of the rice sold yesterday was loaded by inland merchants, followed by purchases from the main street market and small retailers. The total transaction volume was 20,000 bags of small finely milled rice, with the price ranging from eleven yuan for high-quality rice to ten yuan and eight jiao to ten yuan and fifty-eight fen for the main market rice. 1,500 bags of small finely milled old brown rice were sold at nine yuan and sixty-five fen. 1,000 bags of "Qieladi" brown rice were sold at ten yuan and six fen. 300 tons of small finely milled rice were repurchased at five taels and five fen to five taels and three fen, which was one jiao to five or six fen higher than the spot price of the previous market, and five fen higher for futures. However, foreign firms were still selling. Yesterday, a new transaction of 1,000 tons of Siamese rice for June was made at five taels and four qian, sold by Shunquanlong and purchased by merchants in the main street market. The price of "Ke Xian" [another type of rice] was also boosted by foreign rice. However, only a few hundred bags of Taizhou white rice remained on the market, and the quality was relatively poor. A total of 400 bags were sold at ten yuan and fifty-five fen to ten yuan and five jiao. It was still difficult for Jiangxi "Xian" rice to arrive in Shanghai, but "Yuan" rice continued to arrive in Shanghai. Yesterday, 500 bags were sold at fourteen yuan and seven jiao to fourteen yuan and a half. High-quality and low-quality rice lacked both arrival and sales.</p>
<h3>Spot Flour Only Packaged, Not Opened</h3>
<p>— Buyers and Sellers Both Watching</p>
<p>Yesterday, the spot flour market was unusually quiet. There were no transactions between buyers and sellers, so the entire market was only packaged and not opened. This was because new wheat was about to enter the market. Inland merchants were all tending to wait and see. Only Fuxin opened 2,000 bags of warship flour at two taels and four fen, which seemed slightly firmer than yesterday's market. According to general speculation, because this year's wheat crops are abundant, good weather is essential during the crucial harvest period to avoid any adverse impact.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods</h3>
<h3>After the Reopening of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway</h3>
<h3>Sales of Various Goods Slightly Improved</h3>
<p>Since the reopening of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, the sales of piece goods have improved compared to before. Customers from the Suzhou and Changzhou areas have come to Shanghai in droves. The wholesale business in the main street market has made considerable progress. Yesterday, bleached cloth was very active. "Ren Shi" [brand name] was at ten taels and two qian and a half, "Ren Xiang" at nine taels and five qian, "Hong Ji" at twelve taels and seven qian and a half, and "Xing Hua Cun" at ten taels and five qian. Poplin also had good momentum. The goods around three qian were almost completely sold out. "Xin Ji Feng Yun Ji Hui" has risen from three qian to three qian and two fen. Suoyang yarn is also gradually becoming active. "Tian Fu Tu Bai" was at thirteen taels, and "Tai He Tu Yuan" at twelve taels and five qian. The Shanghai printed cloth of the local factory was purchased by Ningbo and other inland merchants, with the price still at four taels and four qian to four taels and seven qian and a half. "Lun Chang" blue striped serge was exceptionally popular, requiring one qian and eight fen. However, deep-colored serge, Chonghua Zhigong cloth, and other products were relatively sluggish due to the unsuitable season. The newly produced "Xue Chi Bu" [Shame-Erasing Cloth], "Gai Liang Bu" [Improved Cloth], and "Guo Chi Bu" [National Shame Cloth] had very smooth sales in the main street market, with prices ranging from one qian and eight fen to two qian.</p>
<h3>Zhabei Goods - Sales of Orchid and Bamboo Branches are Sluggish</h3>
<p>— Further Decline Compared to Before</p>
<p>Recently, due to the unrest in Zhangzhou, shipments of orchid and bamboo branches have continued to arrive in Shanghai, although the quantity is not large. However, the Shanghai market is sluggish, and the demand is minimal. Even without continued arrivals, prices have already fallen. As a result, the market has become even more depressed. The highest-quality selected orchid and bamboo branches are currently offered at thirty-five or thirty-six taels, but there are sales but no buyers. Other lower-quality goods must be reduced in price accordingly. As for the inventory, it is not very large, but due to the stagnant sales, it is not easy to revive the market in the short term.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market - Raw Sugar and White Sugar Market Quiet and Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Sugar Market Association held a market session. Due to the weekend, the transactions were light and the market atmosphere was stable. The transaction price for Dutch No. 24 raw white sugar was thirteen taels and four qian, and Hong Kong goods were thirteen taels and three qian, with few shipments. No. 20 medium white sugar was at thirteen taels and one qian and a half, and finely ground white sugar was at thirteen taels and five qian, with scattered demand. Taikoo sugar was transported to Shanghai for sales due to lower market prices in Tianjin, Qingdao, and other places, causing the market to weaken and transactions to become more sluggish. Tianjin B-marked sugar was quoted at sixteen taels and three qian, with few buyers. Original CW-marked goods were at fifteen taels and nine qian, HM-marked goods at fourteen taels, and H-marked goods at twelve taels and two qian, with sluggish transactions. The market situation remained firm. Zhenxiang Sugar still had spot sales of Hong Kong raw white sugar, priced at thirteen taels and three qian, with stable interest from the trade. Local factory refined white sugar from Zhenji Factory continued to sell, priced at twelve taels and nine qian to thirteen taels and one qian, with the highest-quality sugar quoted at thirteen taels and five qian. A total of over a hundred bags were sold, with slight sales in the main street market, and the market situation was stable and uneventful.</p>
<h3>Metals</h3>
<h3>The Price of Copper Plummeted</h3>
<p>Since the cessation of hostilities, the copper market has become very quiet. Although shipyards and merchants from various regions in the main street market have made some purchases, the quantity is small. Therefore, there is a sense of difficulty in seeing any gains or losses in the market situation. In recent days, foreign firms have been frequently urging customers to take delivery of outstanding goods due to the approaching end of June settlement period (the end of June is the bank's semi-annual settlement period). It is found that there are a total of five or six hundred tons of copper that have not been delivered in Shanghai. Due to financial considerations, foreign firms have had to sell at a loss. Therefore, there are many spot goods being offered for sale in the market recently, and the standard prospects have been greatly affected. Therefore, the recent market is only offering thirty-seven taels and five qian, down one tael and a half from last week, and down seven qian and a half compared to the beginning of the week. However, with more goods than demand, people are fearful, so the future market is likely to plummet.</p>

<h3>Respectfully Informing Contributors</h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>Since the reform of this publication, we have been greatly honored to receive numerous masterpieces from you all. However, due to limited space, we have been unable to fully publish all the great works, which is deeply regrettable. The purpose of this publication has been stated twice before, and we trust that you are already aware of it. The purpose of this publication is, on the one hand, to promote simple living and small crafts, so we have a "Scientific Knowledge" column every day to provide references for those who are enthusiastic about crafts. On the other hand, we aim to improve society, vigorously correct extravagance, and reject hypocrisy, to fully expose the weaknesses of the strangely developing Shanghai society. The original intention is to promote good and criticize evil. Because Shanghai is the crystallization of culture and a model for society, others observe and imitate it, so the impact is not limited to one area. We will now present several standards for your reference:</p>
<p>(1) Family Life: The conflict between new and old families is undeniable (i.e., large families vs. small families). This is the result of the growth of new and old ideas. Therefore, given the current trend, the large family system has no possibility of survival. Can you describe the shortcomings of the old family system from a single branch or section? (The method of description should not be general, but should be written point by point, i.e., seeing the big from the small, the obvious from the subtle, to create a good article. The following items are the same.)</p>
<p>(2) School Portraits: Schools are cultural centers and are closely related to the future of the country. While there are many schools in Shanghai that are run seriously, there are also not a few that are run for profit. The impact is related to the national destiny and cannot be ignored. Therefore, the first thing to describe is the commercialization of schools, the second is to describe the slovenly teachers, and the third is to describe the aristocratic and romantic lives of students.</p>
<p>(3) Business Know-How: The decline of Chinese commerce is due, on the one hand, to the inability to improve manufacturing, and on the other hand, to the fact that merchants absolutely do not understand how to do business. Anyone who has been to Shanghai once (not to mention those who have lived in Shanghai for a long time) knows that Shanghai merchants are very arrogant. Regardless of whether it is a company or a shop, the better the business, the more stern the face. Dealing with them is like seeking revenge, which is completely contrary to the original intention of doing business. This is one aspect. Also, the merchant's face varies depending on the customer's status. They show one face to the car class, another face to the common people, and different faces to fashionable women and rural old women. This is not the attitude that a merchant should take. Can you vividly portray their snobbish faces and methods?</p>
<p>(4) Shanghai Society: Shanghai society is extremely extravagant, extremely hypocritical, and extremely degenerate. The current society is either following the bad habits of the Qing Dynasty or imitating the superficial aspects of Europe and America. For example, it is not necessary to talk about the extreme extravagance of weddings and funerals. Even if a "A da" [Shanghai dialect for older servant] gives birth to a "A er" [Shanghai dialect for younger servant], they have to send out invitations and invite guests. Having found twenty-four yuan, twenty-three and a half yuan is worn on the body. These kinds of things cannot be fully described. Can you break through their weaknesses in one or two incidents?</p>
<p>(5) The Pursuit of Sex: The issue of sex can certainly be described. Mencius said that food and sex are human nature. However, in Shanghai society, there are quite a few men with party (not the Kuomintang party) leanings, and it is difficult to guarantee that there are none among women. This is also undeniable. However, it must be written in a noble, hidden, profound, and realistic way. It must not be written in a naked way. It must be written like "Dream of the Red Chamber", not like "The Carnal Prayer Mat".</p>
<p>(6) Social Darkness: Shanghai society has many dark secrets that are difficult to describe in writing. Even those that have already been published in this publication are numerous, such as the "Lane Portraits". There is indeed good material in them, and it is worth publishing. However, it must be written vividly, not rigidly; it must be written interestingly, not obscenely.</p>
<p>Please follow these standards when sending in your contributions. We eagerly await them. However, there are often many strange things in Shanghai society that cannot be measured by common sense or constrained by appearances. For example, in such a materially civilized city of Shanghai, the incense of Red Temple Wu Jianguang and others is flourishing, which is rarely seen in the world. How can this situation be measured by reason? If you find this kind of situation, this publication also welcomes it. What I have presented is only a general outline. Whether you can understand it thoroughly depends on your point of view and your description. On the verge of writing, I am overwhelmed with anticipation.</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous Poems on Current Events</h3>
<p>— Chen Baoren</p>
<p>The east wind blows rain again at Qingming,</p>
<p>The barbaric cavalry rush into the Chinese city.</p>
<p>No wonder the valiant troops number a hundred thousand,</p>
<p>But use peace talks to answer the restoration of peace.</p>
<p>The cannons thunder, the warships tower high,</p>
<p>The fleet拥 [surrounds] pennants and flags on the sea.</p>
<p>The rear army failed to follow and lost the overall situation,</p>
<p>Tragically listening to the roar of the angry waves.</p>
<p>The creaking of machines moves the earth,</p>
<p>Looking back at Wusong with lingering sorrow.</p>
<p>The windbreak forests on the coast are mostly ashes,</p>
<p>Tears sprinkle on the riverbank, recounting the calamity of fire.</p>
<p>The blood of war is still bloody, the bones not yet cold,</p>
<p>How can one bear to speak of joy and sorrow from the mounds?</p>
<p>Who will save the sandworms, apes, and cranes?</p>
<p>One cannot bear to look at the picturesque Jiangshan.</p>

<h3>Offline Rays and Vitamin D</h3>
<p>— Bingying</p>
<p>I saw Mr. Ji's article on Vitamin Tai in the science column of the Japanese publication on the 6th, and I am very grateful that he was able to introduce the scientific knowledge that the public needs and can actually experiment with. However, I feel that Mr. Ji has overlooked the section on Vitamin D... containing sunlight and sunlamp light, and I am afraid that today's scientists cannot invent such a mysterious fact? If you readers do not believe it, please look at the text on Vitamin D in the twelfth issue of the seventeenth volume of Women's Magazine, which I have honestly extracted to make a proof.</p>
<p>According to scientists, sunlight and Vitamin D are closely related. Sunlight and other light sources of ultraviolet rays can prevent or treat rickets in children, and the effect is almost the same as cod liver oil. The reason is that ultraviolet rays can produce Vitamin D in the human body.</p>
<p>Many plants and animals (including humans) contain a chemical called Ergosterol. When exposed to ultraviolet rays, this substance turns into another chemical substance, which is Vitamin D. Therefore, if children with rickets are exposed to sunlight or ultraviolet rays, the Ergosterol in their bodies will turn into vitamins, which is no different from what cod liver oil provides. Generally, as long as we can eat enough fresh eggs, it is enough to supply enough Vitamin D without having to use artificial methods or refined materials.</p>

<h3>Incantations [Zhuyou Ke]</h3>
<p>— You</p>
<p>Because I was exposed to too much moisture, my legs were a bit numb, and I felt a bit inconvenient when walking, so I wanted to ask a doctor to treat me.</p>
<p>As luck would have it, as soon as I walked out the door, someone handed me a leaflet. I thought it was either from the ×× Party or the Postal Service's strike declaration. After looking at it, no, no, it turned out to be the third-generation ancestral Zhuyou Ke ××× offering free medical treatment to all sectors for ten days.</p>
<p>I am most afraid of getting sick, because getting sick means having to consult a doctor. Western doctors want to force me to get injections, and Chinese doctors must ask me to drink bitter medicine, so it is better not to get sick. When I get sick, it makes me want to cry.</p>
<p>Now, thank goodness, no injections, no bitter medicine, and no need to pay a high registration fee to treat my legs. Why not do such a cheap thing? A great opportunity, not to be missed. I turned around and started walking.</p>
<p>I passed through an unbearable, smelly alley. Next, I walked into a gray-black house.</p>
<p>An old man with a half-beard looked at my legs, then lit a stick of incense, took an iron needle, smoked it on the incense for a while, chanted words, and stabbed at the wooden head wrapped in yellow paper in front of him. "Does it hurt?" he turned his head and asked. "No," my legs didn't even itch, let alone hurt? Finally, after hesitating for a few seconds, I blurted out this answer.</p>
<p>"Then is it sour? Or does it feel hot?" His unskilled Mandarin finally switched to local dialect.</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Oh! Wrong! No pain, no sourness, no hotness, not good, not good!" A large number of "no" words spread from his mouth into the space.</p>
<p>He went on to say, "You must be offending a ×× star, your legs are going to be paralyzed. If you don't give me three pieces of tin foil to resolve it, this disease will be difficult to cure. I [地]答 [this place]鞋 [also] can buy tin foil for you."</p>
<p>I ignored him.</p>
<p>The medical procedure was over. He gave me two pills, asked me for four copper coins, and finally, in the sound of "Come again after eating them", sent me out of his "treasure shop".</p>

<h3>A Record of the Harmonica Team's慰劳 [Comfort Performance]</h3>
<p>— Zhao Shuzhuo</p>
<p>The warm weather blew us away from Shanghai. The comrades of our harmonica team were all filled with pleasure. Leaving Shanghai under the iron heel, leaving Shanghai where gold obscures nature, goodbye Shanghai, Shanghai goodbye.</p>
<p>The green on both sides of the river reflected in our eyes, and the loving farmers tilled their fields. But they do not have the same emotions as poets. The beautiful summer has come, but they also do not have the same feelings as modern youths. How should they revel in this charming scenery? They only know that this is the time to cultivate.</p>
<p>The ship moved forward non-stop. We all talked about blowing the enemy soldiers back to Tokyo with this small harmonica. But this was just us blowing around.</p>
<p>The setting sun showed its final struggle, and the river water spewed out endless sorrow. Night fell. The ship moved forward non-stop. We talked casually. Indeed, the moon of Wumen is very dim, but it does not arouse much of our nostalgia. The bell told us that it was already two o'clock in the morning. The ship's whistle sounded a long howl. Suzhou had arrived.</p>
<p>Come on, friends! Sing, friends! So we all sang, to wake up the people in this ancient city. Entering 閶門 [Changmen Gate], people were not asleep, but how could they be said to be awake? The sound of mahjong, the music of the singing girls,... everything was the original Suzhou.</p>
<p>Sixteen hours of hibernation on the ship really made us tired, and we had to play hard tomorrow, so we had to rest early.</p>
<p>We all felt very heartbroken. Why couldn't we comfort them in Shanghai? They were also very ashamed to have withdrawn from Shanghai, and even received comfort from the people of Shanghai. Both sides were filled with endless grief, but we understood each other very well.</p>
<p>Speaking of comforting them, we really didn't dare to. Every time we went to a place, we had special cars and special ships, and after the performance, there was always good food. Comrade Liu Xieren said that the food on the front line was both rough and sweet. Sweet it was, but not rough. Of course, this was especially for us. Speaking of comfort, they comforted us, not us comforting them.</p>
<p>In the brigade headquarters of the 156th Brigade, we asked Brigade Commander Weng to take a photo with the spoils of war from Taicang. He said that this thing was too small. Wait until I get a × before I let you take a photo.</p>
<p>On the 27th, we went to Taicang to comfort them. After the performance, Brigade Commander Weng sent us off on the ship. Everyone received a towel from the Transportation Department and a book from Brigade Commander Zhang Li. Moreover, we received one hundred yuan from Brigade Commander Weng, which we should not have received, as travel expenses. The end of the remarks!</p>
<p>Goodbye Taicang, goodbye dear brothers. Alas! The Shanghai 会 [Meeting]! Hurry up! (Thank You)</p>

<h3>Declaration of Valid Seal</h3>
<p>Previously, I, together with Gu Zhixiang, jointly contracted to construct the new Yituo of the Shanghai Arsenal Pharmaceutical Factory and to repair the old chestnut medicine factory's buildings. It was agreed between the two parties that I would be responsible for all incoming and outgoing funds. The square seal for receiving funds from the arsenal [文日顧志記圖書] was also kept by me. There are ledgers and bank transaction deposit books as proof of the handling. This has also been reported to the arsenal. Now that the project is completed and it is time to receive the third phase of funds, Gu Zhixiang suddenly published a statement on April 28th in the name of Gu Zhiji Construction Factory, stating that the aforementioned seal was lost due to the war and that any subsequent findings would be invalid, etc. This is extremely alarming and it is clear that there is another purpose. In addition to declaring to the accounting department of the arsenal that the seal remains valid, a special declaration is made as above. Yao Wenhuan 28th day of the 5th month of the 21st year</p>
