<h3 id="c1">德國巴本内閣辭職與歐洲政局又玄 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>一</p>
<p>德國軍備平等要求盛倡凡爾賽和約第五章應即撤消之議發生以來全歐震動世界視線又復集中於歐洲以爲軍備縮小會議一旦破裂則德法仇視問題在德國則以爲法國壓抑過甚在法國則惴惴於安全問題同時德國自身之經濟恐慌并未稍減且又加甚焉其工業生產指數如一九二八年爲一○○去年九月爲六六·四今年九月且低落至五一·三輸出貿易今年九月份比去年同期竟減少三萬萬九千一百萬馬克農產物品價格之撑持力原極堅强比之戰前竟低落百分之九而爲九一失業人數之激劇增加尤爲令人驚詫故其國内政局自白魯寗内閣以來即已脫離議會政治之通常原則而變爲一種變相的專制每以總統名義發佈緊急命令以處理國政因此希脫拉派應運而生其勢瀰漫德國全境在七月三十一大選之後終使白魯寗不能不去位</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>巴本一躍而持政柄復不得於國社黨故議會開院之初不能不立即解散議會圖另開新局以試德國國民之傾向究竟何如十一月六日大選結果各派所得議席大體如下</p>
<p>國家社會黨一九五　社會民主黨一二一</p>
<p>共產黨一○○　　　天主敎中央黨七○</p>
<p>德國國權黨（政府黨）五一　巴維亞中央黨一八</p>
<p>德國人民黨（政府黨）一一　德國農民黨六</p>
<p>基督敎社會黨五　（不滿五席者從略）</p>
<p>兩個政府與黨合計議席亦僅六十二在五百八十二頭議員中爲數不過百分之九而强如循議會政治正軌又有何法以繼續維持其政權且希特拉又已公開宣言决不加入巴本内閣社會民主黨亦不肯與之合作共產黨更無論矣則巴本氏捨再度解散議會而外决無維持其政權之可能也</p>
<p>至於國社黨此次選舉結果雖較七月三十一日大選失去三十五席但仍居第一黨地位然德國人民對國社黨已漸失其熱烈之同情而爲較理性之觀察希脫拉派僅以三分之一的議席亦無統制議會之可能其他黨派亦鮮有能與之誠意合作者至於外交問題如對法對英似均落於第二義蓋法國之對德也并非恐𢣷以中層分子爲基幹而暗中與金融資本家携手之希脫拉其所畏者乃德國國防力之擴張軍事實力之復興也故希脫拉征取政權之困難不在外交而在内政</p>
<p>其他社會黨以下均爲第二第三之勢力更無取得多數之可能且政綱互異路線不同欲成立聯合内閣亦殊難於長久矧第一黨之國社黨旣不能組閣則其他黨派必更加困難矣</p>
<p>總之德國目前政治情勢如欲依立憲政治之常軌取得議院之多數議席現有各派無論用任何方法均不可能即使再次以總統命令解散議會重新第三次選舉其結果雖各黨派不免有多少參差但根本上實難有巨大之異同也</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>至於對外問題之最主要者厥爲「軍備平等」在德國對此雖認爲十分重要爲其安全所必需尤爲德國解除凡爾賽和約束縳之主要關鍵故必努力奮爭否則即不參加軍縮會議將採取自由行動然目前德國經濟實力縱令取得軍備平等之權利擺脫賠欵之拘束當此世界經濟恐慌未知所屆之際英法美諸國且自審其國力不敢驟然爲軍備之擴張以重困於更難之境遇而德意志當大創之後値經濟疲弊之秋奈何能擴張其軍備耶其所爭持者僅在於圖軍事的解放耳乃法國之極不放心惟恐其「安全」不得保障於是民族間之仇恨乃愈濃厚歐洲之癌腫仍難消除</p>
<p>設使巴本内閣辭職而後希脫拉氏繼之而興其不能安定德國政局恢復目前之經濟頽勢消滅巨大之失業工人恐亦與白魯寗巴本之過去政蹟無多大區别矧國社黨所標榜之經濟的自給自足政策在今日世界中誠爲一時的寵兒叩之實際與夫一般趨向究不免爲一種離開實際之理想而德國政局一現制度之下縱使同心異體之巴本與希脫拉合而爲一亦不過暫時之局蓋對外對内均不能於短期間打開新局面而混沌之勢恐將不免於繼續推演也</p>

<p>極盡訾毁中國之能事</p>
<p>所言無非日人之老調</p>
<p>▲電通社十八日東京電日政府對李頓報告書之意見書其後修正點全部完畢正本已到日内瓦日本代表部並完畢提出國聯事務局之手續本日已由外務省發表意見書大要如下</p>
<p>緒論李頓報告書中爲日本所滿足者下列二點卽一承認中國分裂混亂爲無政府狀態之事實一承認中國排斥日貨受南京政府之獎勵贊助且爲用非法手段隨暴力而遂行之事實然人體於日本不利於中國有利的證佐之下而下斷案此由李頓委員會派遣之初卽抱一國軍隊侵略異領之先人爲主觀念又靠何　適當之方法以匡此之故得如此不合法之結論意者　委員等不懂華語滯在期間又短或爲其原因之一</p>
<p>第一章中國中國雖爲曾被統一之國家而有存在之事現在則不過一廣入地域之名稱而已然中國雖在不統一無政府狀態而歐美人對其爲國家而存在之觀念不能拔去領土不可侵之原則雖爲神聖然能適用無政府之無政府狀態的國家已早非國家矣統一中國之最後政府卽袁世凱之共和政府崩潰後中國已無政府存在國家存在亦同時停止華府會議承認中國有統一政府存在之協議此爲中國墮落之原因中國不過一個之希望理想而已絶非國家列國承認南京政府就其權威範圍所及而承認之而已滿洲自然不在其範圍之内卽李頓報告書亦不承認滿洲在南京政府指揮之下</p>
<p>第二章滿洲滿洲最初卽離中國本土而獨立存在自清朝成立雖一時合併清朝旣亡自然分離張家二代並未受中國本土何等拘束一九二八年張學良雖與南京政府有多少之聯絡况因張家二代之暴政獨立之機運自然於滿洲之民間釀成之</p>
<p>第三章九一八事變及後之軍事行動委員會雖承認鐵道爆破然誰實爲之並未言明又斷定日本軍之行動超越自衛範圍然假令日本當時　採緊急措置日本必從滿洲被逐而去委員之斷定偏重中國方面之說明而不知中日間之緊急事態係因從來中國方面繼續的攻擊態度進展之結果所致委員會對於此層漠然視之又謂轟炸錦州爲不當然日本之行動乃係海牙條約所承認之正當行動</p>
<p>第四章「新國家」報告書關於「新國家」似斷定爲日本軍所創造而對於日本政府及軍司令部曾嚴命日本卽個人的亦不許參加滿洲政治運動之事實則視若無覩報告書又斷定滿洲住民不願在日本支配之下然不能作爲希望恢復無政府狀態及南京政府支配下之解釋若滿洲住民希望張政權之恢復何以張政權被滿洲驅逐委員會斷定日本創造「滿洲國」是對此層未加　察報告書承認外國軍隊存在下之如斯結果然此限於外國軍隊有敵意時言之例如愛斯德尼亞革命係於美國海軍援助之下行之然亦卽時承認要之「滿洲國」爲滿洲人所支配卽中國人因能安定故亦希望歡迎之</p>
<p>第五章結論報告書中第九章第十章係案於以上誤謬之上之結論尤以因「滿洲新國家」之成立與調查委員會之調查當時事勢一變故其指示對於問題之解决已無一顧之價値根據上述理由確信中日紛爭之根本解决須列國正確認識中國與滿洲之現實而育成「滿洲國」始能保持遠東恒久之和平以及世界和平</p>
<p>按日政府此項意見書之大意不外一醜詆中國不成爲國家二認滿洲與中國本無關係三所謂新國家非日本所造成四指責國聯報告之認識不足凡此種種抹煞事實不顧公理之狂悖謬論日久早已盡量宣傳本報亦屢爲文駁之本無再與辯論之價値惟今日竟以此種極無理之狂悖謬論形之於政國聯之正式公文其痛詆我國之處非特不稍顧及國際間之禮貌且盡情揑飾無異無賴駡人口脗而絶不反顧自己之國内分擾不寗暗殺火併之事層見迭出寗稍賢於我國乃竟不顧一切肆言無忌若此正所謂是可忍孰不可忍能不更令我國人髮指乎至其結論謂欲維持遠東和平應承認滿洲與中國現在之事實則吾人敢問國聯國聯果能承認疔以廢棄盟約與九國公約非戰公約也則承認彼所謂現成之事實可也如其不能將有何理由以承認其事實耶明之國聯會員其熟思之</p>

<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>│矛盾和滑稽│</p>
<p>慈善和藹的老牧師，講着「博愛」和到「天國去」的道理；座上的衆男女，唱着讚美之歌，做着誠懇的祈禱，這一間禮拜堂裏，眞充滿着和平慈祥的空氣，愉快悅耳的歌讚。天國在那裏？天國便在這裏！和平神在那裏？和平神也在這裏！所以在星期日没事的當兒，我也常常到這堂裏來坐坐，求心靈上暫時的安慰，覩和平神，片刻的顯現。可是這禮拜堂，離開公園靶子場僅三里路，每逢禮拜虔誠的當兒，亦是日軍操練勤忙的時候。格登的機槍聲，劈拍劈拍的步槍聲，總是驚破全堂的空氣。堂裹頭一陣歌禱聲，堂外頭一陣槍砲聲，好像交響曲的奏着。不過這一闋歌曲，似乎太滑稽而又大矛盾了！把他們兩方對照着，一個是和藹的笑容，一個是猙獰的殺氣；那邊勸你歸天國，這邊送您到死鄕；此方是和平，大同，愷祥，仁慈的世界，彼方是恐怖，殘酷，死亡，絶滅的境域。而且再進一步說，堂裏的和平，外表是眞的，可是那老牧師，或是衆男女，一出了禮拜堂，安見不顯露着猙獰的面目殘酷的手段呢？足見和平的實現，那是很難能的。而日軍的槍砲，雖是操演，雖是練習，像一二八那天的把戲，隨時有實演的可能，足見戰爭的危險，是一觸即發的。</p>
<p>咳！和平，戰爭，這一闋交響曲，國内，國外，全世界，隨處隨時地奏着。你看列强不是拚命地擴充軍備麽？可是軍縮會議席上，你也提出限制飛機大砲；我也提出節省軍費。東鄰的日本，不是常喊着中日親善，共存共榮麽？可是東北的肥肉，他一口呑了下去：上海的閘北，又給他飛機大砲，搗亂一陣。此外的一切，又很多這種現象。和平與戰爭交響着，眞是滑稽！眞是矛盾！</p>

<p>— 閻重樓</p>
<p>│是罪惡的│</p>
<p>我前幾天曾經在本刋上談論過罪惡的『駡』，我現在再來談談罪惡的『諂』。</p>
<p>除過子路外，可以說没有一個人不是『聞過則怒聞譽則樂』的，本來人如有過則過，人如有譽則譽，偏是社會上有一種人，專門迎合世人的心理，你無譽他。要譽你，甚至你有過他也要譽你，這就是所謂的諂術。</p>
<p>工諂善媚的人，他可以用種種的諂術來諂媚你，以求達到他諂你的目的。在被諂的方面，因爲諂令智昏，就會不知不覺的墮入諂術中了！</p>
<p>『諂媚人的人，雖然已失去了高尙的！』諂媚人的人，雖然已失去了高尙的人格，但在他是可以利用施行諂術的結果來作威作福的！根據上論，我們更可得一個新發現，就是！『越是慣在人前誇張的人，越富有奴隸性。』</p>
<p>諂是罪惡的，諂是害人的，你如果要預防諂術，必須能履行『聞譽恐！聞過欣！』的兩項原則。</p>

<p>— 金不同</p>
<p>│吃飯之難在其次│</p>
<p>「天下無如吃飯難」吃飯問題，雖是天下之最難，但是現在已有車載斗量的經濟學家，社會學家，戴起了三千度的近光眼鏡，搖頭擺腦的研究，大致在不近將來，</p>
<p>或許可以研究出一個有飯大家吃的辦法，解除困難。所以我想將來天下最難的事情，一定不是吃飯，而要挨到租屋這一回事。</p>
<p>在下本來是獨　兒在上海謀生的。可是初到上海時，要找一處蔽蔽風雨的所在，委實不易，見了紅召租，敲門進去，十家倒有十一家是無眷不租。後來還是叨了一位老世叔的光，由他負了一百二十分的責，才租到了一間僅可容膝的斗室，做晚上安頓臭皮囊的公館。</p>
<p>不得了，一到夏季，悶熱倒還在其次，因爲注了防疫針，不怕發痧，可是上千的臭蟲，完全靠我供給糧食，有些負擔不了。於是决計遷地爲良。吃一次苦，學一次乖，這次遷居，决計把鄕下的夫人，同二位結晶品，帶了出來同居，靠靠牌頭，免碰無眷不租的釘子。</p>
<p>我帶了夫人公子，見了紅召租，敲門進去。二房東太太開口第一名便問幾個人，我說兩夫妻，二個孩子，一個女傭。二房東太太說，這房子裏没有小孩的，有了小孩太煩，不租。我又碰了個釘子，於是見了紅召租，先把耳朶貼在門縫上聽，聽到後來，給我聽到裏面有小孩哭聲的，忙敲門進去。二房東太太一見把頭搖個不止，連說，不租，不租，自己小孩，已吵得要命，再搬二個來，房子要吵坍啦。</p>
<p>拿破崙說：字典中無難字，假使他到上海來，一定也要說，「租房難。」</p>

<p>— 范烟橋</p>
<p>不過經歷得多了　光也厲害了，在藝術以外，有的條件要考究了。於是霓裳舞塲裏二十多個舞女，只有一個看上了慕良的正法眼藏，這人名呌蔣愛麗。</p>
<p>十一點鐘以後，舞客漸漸的多了，樂隊的吹奏也格外有力了，一對一對的繽纷錯雜，眞合着一句詩：「落花蝴蝶作團飛」了。愛麗是霓裳舞塲的一顆明星，自然忙得很，不容易給慕良捉住，慕良爲好把香檳酒去巴結伊，一瓶，兩瓶，在緊張的時候，一夜開半打也說不定的。後來他懂得决竅了，索性去得晏些，非到樂止，燈息，舞女們披了斗篷大衣，準備走出舞塲，他决不回去。這　有機會，和愛麗作短時間的密語，但是愛麗十分俏皮，無論如何，總是說：</p>
<p>「對不起，我頭痛得很，要緊去睡了，明天會罷」。不等他再說什麽話，飛了一個吻給他，鑽進那預先僱定的白牌汽車裏去，嗚嗚的遠而避之了。</p>
<p>慕良恍惚若有所失地還到租賃的公館裏時，他的夫人總是遽遽入夢了。直到第二天，日上三竿，慕良起身了，纔問他：「昨夜什麽時候還來的？又在那裏玩着」？慕良支吾着隨意扯了一個謊，便過去了。</p>
<p>一天，慕良還來得分外的早，夫人也驚異起來，說：「今夜没有約了」。</p>
<p>慕良没精打采的說：「唔」！</p>
<p>韓大少奶說：「今天無綫電報告，十九路軍退第二道防綫，蘇州要吃緊了」。慕良還只答一個「唔」，自己覺得太不關心國事了，勉强再說一聲：「眞的麽」？韓大少奶說：「怎麽不眞！我剛纔還聽見門外喊賣「申報號外」，也是這般說，不過還有一個好消息，快要講和了。」</p>
<p>最後的一句，纔有力鼓起慕良的精神來說：</p>
<p>「橫豎打不過的，不如早早的講和，否則在洛陽喊着長期抵抗。東南的精華快完結了」。難得今天他高興，自從避難到了上海以後，國事的批評，一天一天的減少，或者租界上的空氣，别具一種不可思議的魔力，使人們麻痺而頽廢的。</p>
<p>韓大少奶也興奮了不少。放下了手裏的絨繩背心和針，走得近他些，坐了下來，準備和他作長時間的談話了。說：</p>
<p>「謝天謝地，快些了結罷，住在這螺絲殼裏，乏味極了，走盡六尺地，成了我們蘇州城外的江北棚子了。」</p>

<p>— 佛</p>
<p>前日我在某處看大規模展覽會時，遇見了一位多年未見的老友，瞎談之下，他突名間問我道，你對於那一種人最怕，我答道，我怕的人很少，惟有一種人我是最怕的，</p>
<p>他又問我道，是那一種人，難道是强盜麽，我說不是，我無財產，怕他則甚，他又猜道，是綁匪麽，我說更是不對，我那裏有此資格，他又道，莫非攔路行刦殺猪　的幾位仁兄麽，我笑道，身上穿的蹩脚衣服，囊中時常「畢跌生司，」何怕之有，他有猜道，想必你最怕的是官了，我說我平生不作犯法的事，官又怕些甚麽，</p>
<p>朋友乃笑道，到底你怕的是什麽樣人，我道我最怕的是幾位厚兄，語曰「天下無難事，獨怕老面皮，」若老面皮的人，我是最怕的；假定我駡他帷薄不修，他宜捷爽快地答道，她本來是人盡夫也，我也靠此營生，假定我說他盜竊行爲，他毫不遲疑地答道，我本來犯案纍纍，這原是老吃老做，若遇着這樣的人，我最是頭痛，毫無辦法，</p>
<p>本來一圙社會，！一個良好的社會，！所以能維持其善良的狀態者，無非是道德，所謂「羞惡之心，人皆有之，是非之心，人皆有之，」而老面皮的人，把廉恥是非，完全打破，社會上的一點西洋鏡，被他拆盡，尙有何法可同他理喻呢，</p>
<p>友人點首稱是，乃從某展覽會話别而出，</p>

<h3 id="c210">染色物之要件 <a href="#c210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— 左企</p>
<p>染色物之優劣，大抵以不褪色與褪色爲標準。但所謂不褪色有兩種不同觀點：自普通購買者之觀點言，不褪色係指耐光與耐洗而言：自印染商與織物製造商之觀點言，所謂不褪色，涵義廣博多矣。除上述兩項條件外，染色物尤須能抵抗織造時所經過之種種手續，茲將染色物所應具之要件分述如左。</p>
<p>（一）耐光此點最關緊要，凡染色在日光之作用下逐漸消失其濃度與光澤者，即謂之褪色，反是謂之不褪色。惟現時已知之各種顏色中，無絶對能久耐日光之曝曬者，無論何種顏色皆必褪色，多少遲速不同耳。故所謂不褪色者，一相對的名詞也。</p>
<p>德人休爾茲（GustaveSchultz）曾將染料按耐光程度分爲若干類，以能耐光至三十日而不稍褪色者列爲第一等，在三日内即呈褪色至二十八日之末而完全失色者，列爲最末等。</p>
<p>（二）耐洗即能抵抗沸水或冷水及肥皂之作用也。關於此點，休爾茲將染料别爲五類，以在沸水中不脫色者爲第一類，在冷水中褪色者爲最末類。惟間有本身並不呈褪色而滲入隣近白色質料者，故吾人於辨别織物之耐洗與否，須注意二點：一，落水是否褪色；二，染色是否滲入隣近純白質料内。</p>
<p>（三）耐擦與白凈之布相擦，而其色不染於白布上者。</p>
<p>（四）耐蒸織物上之染色在蒸氣作用之下，須不呈絲毫减退之形迹。</p>
<p>（五）耐熨織物上之染色須能抵抗熨斗之熱力而不稍脫落。</p>
<p>（六）耐燻織物染色後須經漂白者，如毡毯等類，每用硫烟燻炙之法，故所用染料須能抵抗硫烟之作用而不稍變易。</p>
<p>按染料有酸性染料，鹽基性染料，硫化染料，直接染料，媒染染料等之别。性質旣不同，其對於各種作用之抵抗力或堅牢度，遂亦有異。其中以媒染染料所染之色最爲堅牢，對於日光，水洗，鹻類，摩擦，火熨斗等，均不變易，惜其染法較繁耳。</p>

<h3 id="c211">遺囑的爭執 <a href="#c211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>

<p>▲標點的重要</p>
<p>這件事並非是我杜造，是在一本國文讀本上看見的，很有趣味，也有一些文學性質，可爲茶餘酒後的談料，並非有意抄襲，拾人唾餘，</p>
<p>有富人張某，老而無子，祗生一女，贅某生於家：隔了好多年，那張某的小老婆，纔生了一個男兒，取名一飛，所以家人統統呌他阿一。</p>
<p>當一飛四歲的時候，張某病得十分沉重，我國習俗，贅壻有承繼之權，所以</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>小老婆深憂贅壻奪產，甚至泣下！乃趨告張某，張某乃書一遺囑給她，並且說：『不過要忍耐常久，纔可無憂！』一面又詔其女壻，謊說道：『阿一年幼不可靠，吾的產業，統統給你，不過必須養他母子！』也拿出了一張遺囑給他，唸道·</p>
<p>張一非吾子也家產盡予吾壻外人不得爭奪</p>
<p>等到張某死了，女壻遂獨擁遺產，把一飛當做隸僕看待，當然；一件事壓迫太過，反抗力一定愈强，所以一飛在壓迫之下，去告官伸理，訴請復產；女壻把張某的遺囑呈官，官閱之；與一飛所呈的遺囑相同，不過女壻的遺囑，没有標點。乃向張某的女壻說道：『你的婦翁，因爲一飛年稚，恐怕發生奪產，被你所害，所以把遺囑詭飛作非，並且不用標點，明明誑你，把這些遺產請你管理幾年吧！』一面又拿出一飛的遺囑唸道：</p>
<p>張一非，吾子也，家產盡予；吾壻外人，不得爭奪</p>
<p>官遂判張某的遺產，盡歸一飛。上面的一段事，是曉示没標點的弊端，所以近代倡行新式標點，好像是這個意思吧！</p>

<h3 id="c212">一個黃包車夫的自述 <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— 匡文炳</p>
<p>靠近我攤被包的右間壁，是一爿酒店，在閘北一塊荒凉地段，話雖是這麽說，可是來來往往的小車夫，黃包車夫，以及挑爛泥的短褲朋友，却還不少。酒店便全投靠他們，他們可眞是世之狂飲者，吃飯似乎次要，一斤白酒，兩開（杯）原梁，那是每個都能喝下的，喝醉了，臉袋通紅，腿上顯出一條條的青筋，那便是他們有力的時候了，於是便高歌長嘯，於是便忘却了世間的人面獸心，冷酷，殘暴，以及生活上的種種苦痛，一天我正在讀白樂天的賣炭翁至「可憐身上衣正單，心憂炭賤願天寒，」之句，撫卷長吟，竟被他們的吆喝聲澈腦地驚動了，於是我便步出門來，見有一個黃包車夫蹺足坐在酒店門口頭的方桌旁，醉態朦朧，近似得意，我無意地問：</p>
<p>「儂爲啥這麽開心？」這可打動了他的心絃，他口若懸河地向我訴說：</p>
<p>「這年頭，生意經眞弄弗靈，三十六行，行行走不通，十一年前，我本是海門×村鎭上一個木匠，一天兩角的工資，苦吃苦穿的捱過三年，積了一百元，娶好家主婆，那知從此命更舛了，剛剛十個月，伊就生下一個小奶，一個還不要緊，明朝伊的肚皮忽而絞痛，一息又生出一個那可不得了了，當時鎭上生意又清澹，三天没有兩天生活做，常時捱餓，後來幾個要好朋友，凑借二百元，自己開爿木作行，夥計偏撒爛汚，不到半年，便弄得關門大吉，急煞人，不知怎的忽想到上海來拉黃包車。</p>
<p>苦中光陰，度日如年，拉車畢竟也不是生活啊！</p>
<p>幸虧我有天成的一架强有力的骨骼，手臂鍊過斧頭，（用力伸出右手）拉起車來，倒還不覺得吃力，只有兩條腿呀，（手拍拍腿）眞吃弗消，起始拉三天，</p>
<p>腿固澈骨的酸痛了，連背脊也是酸溜溜地，躺下床去，半晌抽不轉氣，把腿伸直也不方端，彎起來更是脹痛，足足躺了一禮拜，才漸漸地復原了，於是再去拉，一直拉到現在，骨骼全僵化了，唉！簡直喪失了感覺，十一年了呵！</p>
<p>講到拉車的出息，眞是一年不如一年，拉的人只見增多，執照却有額限！不得過萬，租班車子要繳納一千租鈿，租界上的更弗得了！一塊四角大洋，從大清早六點鐘拉到半夜裏十念點鐘，算是交卸了一天的命運，把車子送回公司，餘下不到幾十個銅杯，塞進家主婆手裏，伊也就苦笑一歇。</p>
<p>要想生意靈，只有霎時間來一陣暴風暴雨，去年八月念七號那次大風雨，街心洪水及膝，我却在家裏拉痢，乾眼看人家賺煞快，隔壁的阿念，那天尋到九隻洋進賬，眞是好機會，可惜我錯過了！（用手椎胸）拉車子，肚皮不好吃得太飽，若是吃飽了，不但拉不動，而且跑得連肚皮也要痛，坐的人不管，總是脚踢嗤駡，十一年來我很少按時的吃過飽飯，總是在這塊買隻燒餅吃，那塊吃盌稀飯，或是喝半斤老白酒，或是呷兩開原梁，一家四口，兩個小奶，自己同家主婆，好在伊没有再生下第三個了！每月房租一塊半，是一間黑黝黝的擱樓，一天四百五十鈿米，今年算好，米價便宜，我們還可以四百五十鈿買白米吃，兩隻角子青菜豆腐，再加上酒鈿香烟，一個月起碼要十五隻洋才夠開銷，幸虧家主婆每日販菱買，還能賺幾百鈿墊補，不然，眞要苦得我開不得交呢。</p>
<p>這年頭，生意經眞弄弗靈，拉黃包車更不是生活，但有啥辦法好想！</p>
<p>這時他的醉態，似乎醒了，我也爲了生活的驅策，别了他，回到了自己的屋裏搖筆桿。</p>

<h3 id="c213">吃飯的藝術 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— 兆君</p>
<p>說起學生時代的生活，確是有意味，尤其是吃飯問題，平常上課儘有遲到早退，當學校做旅舍的少爺學生，可是飯鐘一響，便爭先恐後，猶恐不及，那種精神，除掉看賽球外却輕易不能看到的，倘使你後人一步，先到者早已下動員令，狼呑虎嚥，各顯本領，祗好對朝大碗嘆息而已，謙讓之風在飯堂裏是萬萬談不到的，所以爲吃飯問題，千奇古怪的把戲，社會上每天在演着，</p>
<p>在下寄宿校中，爲着吃飯，不知吃了多少虧，因此不得不研究對策，如何應付這種環境，茲將研究所得，不敢自秘，公布出來，</p>
<p>吃飯的藝術，換句話說便是吃菜的藝術，飯多菜少，把經濟學的供求定律講，菜就求過於供，自然菜是衆矢之的，政策是「準，忍，狠，」三字主義，</p>
<p>先談準，在吃飯的時候，應該準時到，萬不可遲到，所謂過時不候，坐失良機，坐下第一件事，先看準那幾樣菜好，菜的成份如何，譬如肉，瞧清楚那一塊瘦肥適中，質地好，分量大，切不可重量而忘質，擇了一塊骨頭，那郤大上其當了，所以在未下箸之先，要有準備，免得下箸無所適從，被人家眼快手快捷足先登，關於吃菜的先後也有關係，凡是塊頭的，如魚·肉·肉圓·等，應該先吃，因爲這類量不多，但是炒肉絲之類，决不會有人很細心底的檢出肉絲來吃，慢點也不妨，</p>
<p>再談忍，菜已到手，有的時候菜太熱，無論怎樣應該忍耐着，倘使不能忍耐，人家一塊一塊向嘴裏送，碗中肴無幾，你豈不損失麽？有時你占了便宜，多享些口福，人家未免面有慍色，或者譏你幾聲，祗可充耳不聞，忍耐爲尙，說到狠，除掉準和忍，還要狠，一塊又一塊，一匙多一匙，儘量的狠心，否則盤中物，自會席捲而去，你不聽是「天下無難事，只怕老面皮」麽，面皮不老，心不狠，自然休想討便宜，我想這準·忍·狠·三字主義，吃飯時多少有些帮助吧，</p>

<p>某縣局晨的上房裏，好像失火似地瀰漫着烟霧，電燈光都染成了昏黃；原來精美的銅牀上橫躺着夫婦二人，他倆兀自在噴雲吐霧，因此把全室都浴在氛圍中了。</p>
<p>他倆狂吸了好久，彷彿精神都已興奮，於是開了話箱，男人先說道：「唉，這兩天的案件，大槪是貧苦的　三居多，一點油水也没有！」這時女的剛吸好一筒烟，連忙喝了一口熱茶，只聽見骨碌一聲，才呼出一口長氣，但餘烟已不知去向了。她道：「啊，老爺何必煩惱！就像前天那件烟案，一件要抵幾件呢；怎能天天有那種的肥肉？」</p>
<p>門外適有彈指的聲息，然後便有一個侍役走進房來，埀手落肩地站在牀前，向男人報告道：「禀局長：外面有人來報告，說某里的王公館私吸鴉片；報告人立等局長派隊同去搜捕。」男人聽了，頓時露出笑容道：「你替我關照督察長去捉回來好了！」他一壁說着，一壁又裝上一筒烟，呼呼地吸起；侍役應了一聲，退出去了。</p>
<p>大約又過了半句鐘，侍役又進來了，說：「財政局長，建設局長和敎育局長同來拜訪。」男人道了一聲「請！」侍役出去將三位客人引着進來。男女同時起身，男的又迎上前道：「三位一道駕臨，倒也難得：有什麽貴幹嗎？」</p>
<p>「今天高興，特地來陪你打八圈！」</p>
<p>「好，歡迎！」</p>
<p>「·······」</p>
<p>「··············」</p>
<p>一陣不同音色的寒暄以後，就是骨牌在檯上跳舞的聲響了。女的還站在男的身旁，參觀他們的竹戰。</p>
<p>經過兩圈牌後，督察長回來了；他一進門來，就笑向男人道：「王公館的烟案已經人證開獲，還連帶地在附近捕捉了一件賭案和兩個私娼！」</p>
<p>「局長的生意眞好！」三位客人同聲地贊羨了。</p>
<p>大約在午夜兩點鐘的辰光，竹戰告終了；三位客人還未盡興，定要主人陪伴他們尋花。主人當然是一口應允，便同向花叢進發，還未抵到目的的地點，有許多倚門賣俏的遠遠看見，早嚇得退進去關起大門了。等他們前往敲門時，裏面抖抖的聲音在回答：「我們早不做生意了，請老爺們饒恕吧！」</p>
<p>「誰說來捉你們？老爺們來開心的！」門外的人這樣說。</p>
<p>又過了好一會，大門始慢慢地開了；幾位老爺笑嬉嬉地走進，才把門裏人的警魂喚了回来！</p>
<p>一片歌唱之聲，久不在空氣中波動；今夜總算逢了特赦，居然能響亮地透露出來。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Resignation of the German Papen Cabinet and the Intricacies of the European Political Situation <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>One</p>
<p>Since the rise of Germany's demand for arms equality and the proposal to abolish Chapter V of the Treaty of Versailles, Europe has been shaken and the world's attention has once again focused on Europe. It is believed that once the disarmament conference breaks down, the Franco-German animosity problem will arise. Germany believes that France's suppression is excessive, while France is apprehensive about its security. At the same time, Germany's own economic panic has not diminished slightly, but has intensified. Its industrial production index, such as 100 in 1928, 66.4 in September of last year, and even fell to 51.3 in September of this year. Exports in September of this year decreased by 391 million marks compared with the same period last year. The supporting power of agricultural product prices was originally extremely strong, but it has fallen by 9% compared with before the war to 91. The dramatic increase in the number of unemployed is even more astonishing. Therefore, since the Brüning cabinet, the domestic political situation has deviated from the usual principles of parliamentary politics and has become a disguised form of autocracy, issuing emergency decrees in the name of the president to deal with state affairs. As a result, the Hitler faction emerged, its power spreading throughout Germany. After the general election on July 31, Brüning was finally forced to step down.</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>Papen jumped up to hold the reins of power, but failed to gain support from the National Socialist Party. Therefore, at the beginning of the parliamentary session, he had to immediately dissolve the parliament and try to open a new situation to test the German people's tendencies. The results of the general election on November 6 showed that the seats won by each faction were roughly as follows:</p>
<p>National Socialist Party: 195 Social Democratic Party: 121</p>
<p>Communist Party: 100 Catholic Center Party: 70</p>
<p>German National People's Party (Government Party): 51 Bavarian People's Party: 18</p>
<p>German People's Party (Government Party): 11 German Farmers' Party: 6</p>
<p>Christian Social Party: 5 (Those with less than five seats are omitted)</p>
<p>The total number of seats held by the two government parties is only 62. In the 582 members of parliament, the number is no more than 9%. Even if they follow the correct path of parliamentary politics, what method can they use to continue to maintain their regime? Moreover, Hitler has already publicly declared that he will never join the Papen cabinet. The Social Democratic Party is also unwilling to cooperate with him, and the Communist Party is even more out of the question. Therefore, Papen has no possibility of maintaining his regime other than dissolving the parliament again.</p>
<p>As for the National Socialist Party, although the result of this election was a loss of 35 seats compared with the general election on July 31, it still occupies the position of the largest party. However, the German people have gradually lost their enthusiastic sympathy for the National Socialist Party and have adopted a more rational observation. The Hitler faction, with only one-third of the seats, also has no possibility of controlling the parliament. Other parties also have few who can sincerely cooperate with them. As for foreign policy issues, such as those with France and Britain, they seem to fall into the second category. France's attitude towards Germany is not fear of Hitler, who is based on middle-class elements and secretly colludes with financial capitalists, but fear of the expansion of Germany's national defense forces and the revival of its military strength. Therefore, the difficulty for Hitler to seize power lies not in foreign policy but in domestic affairs.</p>
<p>Other socialist parties and below are second and third forces, and there is no possibility of obtaining a majority. Moreover, their political programs are different and their routes are different, so it is difficult to establish a coalition cabinet for a long time. If the National Socialist Party, the largest party, cannot form a cabinet, then other parties will inevitably face greater difficulties.</p>
<p>In short, in the current political situation in Germany, it is impossible for any of the existing factions to obtain a majority of seats in the parliament in accordance with the usual rules of constitutional politics, no matter what method is used. Even if the parliament is dissolved again by presidential order and a third election is held, although the various parties will inevitably have some differences, there will be no fundamental differences.</p>
<p>Three</p>
<p>As for the most important foreign policy issue, it is "arms equality." Although Germany considers this to be very important and necessary for its security, it is also the main key for Germany to lift the constraints of the Treaty of Versailles. Therefore, it must strive hard, otherwise it will not participate in the disarmament conference and will take free action. However, given Germany's current economic strength, even if it obtains the right to arms equality and gets rid of the restrictions on reparations, in the midst of this global economic panic, it is unknown when it will end. Countries such as Britain, France, and the United States are also examining their own national strength and dare not suddenly expand their armaments to be burdened by even more difficult circumstances. How can Germany, after a major setback and at a time of economic exhaustion, expand its armaments? What it is arguing for is only to seek military liberation. France is extremely worried that its "security" will not be guaranteed. As a result, national hatred is becoming more intense and the cancer of Europe is still difficult to eliminate.</p>
<p>Assuming that the Papen cabinet resigns and Hitler succeeds it, his inability to stabilize Germany's political situation, restore the current economic decline, and eliminate the huge number of unemployed workers may not be much different from the past political achievements of Brüning and Papen. Moreover, the National Socialist Party's economic self-sufficiency policy is indeed a temporary favorite in today's world. However, when it comes to reality and the general trend, it is inevitably a kind of unrealistic ideal. Under the current system of German politics, even if Papen and Hitler, who are of the same mind but different bodies, unite into one, it will only be a temporary situation. After all, they cannot open up a new situation in the short term, both externally and internally, and the chaotic situation will probably continue to evolve.</p>

<p>(Hankou) The Yu army's attack on Luzhou has not succeeded and has suffered heavy losses. The Yang and Tian brigades defending Luzhou have already made contact with the Gao Ruming brigade. There is no fierce fighting on the front. Liu Xiang is increasing troops to attack Luzhou on one hand, and attacking Nei and Fu with all his strength on the other. The center of the war is gradually shifting. It is rumored from Yu that the Northern Alliance army has occupied Zizhou, but the provincial authorities stated that they had already abandoned the defense and that Deng's army had taken over the defense. Liu and Tian's troops in the provincial capital are still on alert, and there is no major conflict. Zhang Qun has discussed the end of the Sichuan war with Jiang several times and is said to be returning to Nanjing on the 19th (Special Dispatch on the 18th).</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to sources from the Sichuan army representatives stationed in Nanjing, they received an urgent telegram on the 18th that Liu Xiang's 21st Army had occupied the county towns of Zizhong and Neijiang on the afternoon of the 16th. Liu Wenhui's 24th Army troops are retreating towards Xuzhou in the southwest. However, the Luzhou troops are still holding on firmly. However, Zizhong and Neijiang are located between Luzhou and Chengdu, in the middle of the Tuo River. If this place is lost, the Yu army can advance southwest to attack the rear of Fushun and Luzhou.

The Yu army planes and warships jointly attacked Luzhou, destroying its fortifications. The people of Luzhou requested that the provincial army move outside the city to avoid bombing and damage to civilian houses. Deng Xihou accepted Liu Xiang's opinion and reorganized the Chen Hongwen and Chen Shunong divisions of the 24th Army and transferred them to Jianyang to avoid the Allied forces' advance route (Special Dispatch on the 18th).</p>
<p>(Chengdu) Liu Wenhui telegraphed on the 17th, saying to various newspapers: "In view of the above, I, Liu Wenhui, have deleted the telegram sent to the Chairman of the National Government, the Presidents of various Yuan, and Chiang Kai-shek in Hankou, which read (titles omitted). According to reports from Yang, Brigade Commander of Luzhou, Shang Zhou, Brigade Commander, and Zhong Yi, it has been reported that the enemy army has been bombarding Luzhou city for days with large forces, using sulfur bombs to burn down civilian houses. Today, from midnight to noon, in addition to the original six brigades, two more special forces regiments, five planes, and a warship, along with five merchant ships, escorted about sixty or seventy wooden boats, advancing fiercely on three fronts by water, land, and air, and dividing into dozens of teams to forcibly cross the river, advancing wave after wave, with countless dead and wounded. Our army, with one against ten, fought bravely and resisted, which was the first fierce battle since the start of the war in Luzhou. When the enemy forcibly crossed the river, our army calmly responded and waited until half of them landed before concentrating a large force to sweep them away. All the enemies who landed were either killed or captured, and none escaped. Two enemy ships and more than twenty wooden boats were overturned, and three enemy officers, including Wu Shoushan, the commander of the regiment, and Xu Shaoyan, the battalion commander, were killed, and more than a dozen enemy company and platoon commanders were captured. Thousands of enemy officers and soldiers were drowned, and more than 500 enemy rifles and more than a dozen machine guns were seized. As for the losses of our army, we will investigate and report separately. The most tragic thing is that the planes dropped bombs, causing flesh and blood to fly everywhere and houses to be reduced to ashes. The innocent people were killed and wounded, and the essence of the place was destroyed. The people look to the south with their necks craned, their hearts cut. According to Zhang, Brigade Commander Zhifang, the enemy facing the brigade last night used machine guns and mortars to continuously fire on various crossing points along the river, attempting to forcibly cross the river. Fortunately, our soldiers calmly responded and did not succeed. Today, they are still shooting at each other. In the afternoon, planes dropped nine bombs, causing great damage to the people and houses, and the cries of the people shook the sky, the situation was extremely tragic. It is also reported that the enemy who fought fiercely with our Huang regiment at Gaoshikan the day before yesterday had nine regiments, and more than 700 people had been killed or wounded. On the cold day, the brigade commander telegraphed that the enemy had used fierce artillery fire to cover the forced crossing of the river at all crossing points in our defense area at one o'clock this morning, especially at the east, south, and north gates of Fucheng. Our officers and soldiers bravely resisted and the enemy did not make any progress. However, more than 40 enemy shells fell in the city, killing and wounding more than a dozen ordinary people and destroying many civilian houses. A large number of enemies were killed and drowned by us. At 9:00 a.m., the enemy again forcibly crossed the river at Pipa Chang, but two fishing boats were sunk by our defending army. Fighting is still going on along the river. At 2:00 p.m., enemy planes came again to drop three bombs, and fires broke out in several places. The cries of the people shook the sky, the situation was extremely tragic," and so on. After several fierce battles, the enemy suffered heavy losses and failed to succeed. Luzhou and Fushun are still safe. Since yesterday afternoon, the situation at the front has become quiet. It is expected that the enemy will not easily give up, and the fighting will become more intense when reinforcements arrive. It is unexpected that Liu Xiang would act perversely and go to such extremes. His brutality is no different from that of foreign races towards our countrymen. I believe that Your Excellency will also deeply grieve and feel the same pain, and will not bear to sit idly by and watch Sichuan be ruined and exhausted. You must have a way to deal with it as soon as possible. Furthermore, there is no change in Zizhou. In Neijiang, the front at Beimuzhen, thirty miles from the city, is still shooting across the river. This is a respectful telegram. Liu Wenhui kowtows." (Special Dispatch on the 17th).</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to a telegram from Chongqing, Liu Xiang went to Shanghai on the 15th to inspect and returned to Yu on the 16th. Three brigades crossed the river at Hushi, and the Guo and Fan brigades of the Pan Division crossed the river at Datoucheng, defeating Liu Wenhui's Gao Brigade of reinforcements and breaking through the Tuo River defense line of the 24th Army (Special Dispatch on the 18th).</p>

<p>Announced by Commander-in-Chief Chiang at a Party and Government Meeting</p>
<p>(Hankou) Commander-in-Chief Chiang, in order to reorganize the political situation in Hubei, has formulated an eighteen-point outline for the reorganization of Hubei's political affairs. Among these points, some important policies are already underway, some are just beginning, and some are still in the planning stages. The outline was announced at a recent party and government meeting, and the full text is as follows: (1) Implement the system of Administrative Commissioners to ensure that they can fully exercise their powers. (2) Be cautious in selecting county magistrates and public security bureau chiefs. Their performance should be thoroughly assessed and guaranteed, and regulations on rewards and punishments should be strictly enforced. (3) The existing police forces and local self-defense security teams in each county should be strictly reorganized, their structures improved, their numbers verified, their funding sources determined, and their publicly or privately owned firearms should be secured. They should be thoroughly trained, with special emphasis on political common sense and martial arts. (4) After the reorganization of the security teams and other local self-defense groups in each county, the terms of service for able-bodied men in each county should be stipulated as regular, reserve, and backup, without dividing areas of jurisdiction. Internal administration will be guided by military orders. The Security Department will draft implementation plans and proceed in stages. The first phase of reorganization should be completed by March of the 22nd year [1933]. (5) Implement the household registration and Bao-Jia system in accordance with the relevant regulations, and complete the household registration within the prescribed time limit. In special circumstances where it is genuinely impossible to complete the registration on time, a request can be submitted for an extension, but the deadline must not exceed March of the 22nd year [1933]. The entire province must complete the registration uniformly, and a complete review of the entire province should be conducted from May to September of the same year. (6) Except for the budgets of the Hubei Provincial Government and the Hankou Municipal Government, which have already been approved, the revenue and expenditure of all local finances of all county governments and their subordinate agencies throughout the province should be compiled into formal budgets and submitted to the Department of Finance for approval and implementation. From February of next year [1933], all expenditures must be implemented in accordance with the budget. (7) The establishment of the Provincial Farmers' Bank and the credit cooperatives in each county should be preliminarily completed by March of the 22nd year [1933]. (8) The land survey is scheduled to be completed in five years, but the preliminary plan for the first year of the 22nd year [1933] should be specified as soon as possible. (9) All financial institutions should immediately implement an accounting system. (10) All levels of financial personnel must obtain guarantees, and the主管 authorities should supervise them at any time. If there are any cases of embezzlement or fraud, compensation should be pursued and legal punishments enforced. (11) The provincial highway construction plan will be drafted by the Department of Construction, and the road construction will be carried out in phases within one year. The first phase of work should be completed by March of the 22nd year [1933]. (12) Hubei's embankment and water conservancy projects should be transferred to the overall planning of the National Economic Council, and the Jianghan Engineering Bureau under the council should be held responsible for handling the projects, in order to save resources and prevent abuses. (13) In the counties of Hubei, especially in the areas affected by bandits, in addition to working hard to restore the rural areas in accordance with the Land Handling Regulations and the Rural Cooperative Regulations, appropriate areas should be selected to establish group farms to experiment with new farming and management methods. (14) In elementary and secondary education, students should be encouraged to develop a sense of national identity and cultivate a spirit of sacrifice for the country in all courses. (15) Elementary and junior high schools should actively train Boy Scouts. (16) Schools above the junior high level should emphasize military education and make students' lives militarized. (17) The Department of Education will formulate a one-year plan for the literacy movement for the common people, starting from Wuhan. (18) All levels of judicial organs should clear up backlog cases within a limited time. Civil and criminal lawsuits should be concluded within a maximum of one month in accordance with the established procedures, so as to avoid the people suffering from litigation.

<p>(1) The Guangzhou-Shaozhou and Wuchang-Zhuzhou sections of the Yuehan Railway have long been completed and opened to traffic. The Zhuzhou-Shaozhou section, which is currently under construction, is 435 kilometers long. In the area where Hunan and Guangdong provinces meet, it is necessary to pass through the highest mountain range, which is the watershed between the Yangtze River and the Pearl River. The route must pass through this area, and the construction is extremely difficult. The route of this section has been largely determined. As for the Shaozhou-Lechang section, which is about 50 kilometers long, the roadbed work has been largely completed. As long as the funds are allocated, the Shao-Le section can be opened to traffic first in a few months. The route north of Lechang can also be started. It is estimated that the construction cost of the entire Lechang-Zhuzhou section will be more than 70 million yuan. It has been decided to use two-thirds of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity as the construction fund for this project. The audit shows that the total amount is almost the same. However, this kind of fund is returned in installments every year until the 45th year of the Republic [1956] before it can be fully paid. In order to cope with the rapid completion of the Yuehan Railway, it is planned to consult with the board of directors managing the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity to borrow the future installments as a fund to issue public bonds. Detailed plans are currently being drafted and discussed.</p>
<p>(2) The Longhai Railway spans four provinces: Gansu, Shaanxi, Henan, and Jiangsu, and is 1,600 li long. It is an important artery for the development of the Northwest. The route built before the 16th year of the Republic [1927] was from Haizhou Dapu in Jiangsu to Lingbao in Hebei, about 825 kilometers long. Now, the 72-kilometer-long route west of Lingbao to Tongguan has been continuously built and completed, and traffic has started since December 18 of last year. The 130-kilometer-long section from Tongguan to Xi'an, of which 24 kilometers from Tongguan to Huayin, has also been largely completed. The eastern end of the railway was temporarily located at Haizhou Dapu. Now, because the Honghe estuary is silted up and the Dapu wharf has lost its effectiveness, the eastern end of the route has been extended to Shiyao on the opposite bank of the Xilian Island, and a temporary wharf is being built there to facilitate land and water transportation. This project is currently being tendered separately and should be completed in a few months.</p>
<p>(3) The Taitong Branch Line. The Shandong Zhongxing Coal Mining Company is a well-known coal mine in China. The Taitao Railway, a special railway built by the company from Taierzhuang to Zaozhuang near the mine, cannot fully transport coal from Zaozhuang to the Lincheng Station of the Jinpu Railway. Now that we are advocating the development of our country's coal production, we should try our best to find a way, so it is determined to build a railway from Taierzhuang to Tonghe Station of the Longhai Railway.</p>
<p>(4) The Capital Ferry. A special ferry ordered from England has been launched in England and will soon be shipped to China. All the machinery on the wharves has been ordered from abroad. The construction of the local platforms on both sides started in December of the 19th year [1930], and it is expected that traffic will be open in the summer of next year. In the future, the Shanghai-Pingpu through train will only take 47 or 48 hours to reach.</p>
<p>In addition, teams have been sent to survey the Yue-Dian, Xiang-Dian, Jing-Yue, and Qin-Yu lines, but due to the situation, only a section has been surveyed and not completed. The survey work for the Jing-Xiang and Bao-Ning lines has been completed long ago, and construction will start as soon as the funds are raised. (Special dispatch on the 18th)</p>

<p>Doctor Lu Wenzhao Discusses the Course of Treatment</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) It is not true that Chairman Lu has passed away. At 4 p.m. today, Lu walked to the Provincial Government and had dinner at the branch of Zhou's office in No. 31, You Sheng Jin Lane. (Special dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) Lu Wenzhao, director of the Department of Diagnosis and Treatment of the Shanghai Red Cross Hospital, made a statement tonight at 8 p.m. about the treatment of Chairman Lu, saying that he was summoned by Chairman Lu to Hangzhou for consultation and arrived in Hangzhou on the 7th and stayed at the Provincial Government. He diagnosed that Chairman Lu was suffering from a mild stroke, and the only nerves affected were the left internal and left tongue nerves. The left foot was slightly weak and difficult to walk, but his mind was clear and his speech was normal. His stomach was also strong. After taking medicine and resting, his condition improved day by day. In recent days, his pulse was 66 to 74, and his body temperature was 36.4 to 37 degrees. Everything was normal. Chairman Lu has a strong sense of responsibility. He personally reviewed all important documents and browsed all the newspapers in this port, as well as in Shanghai, Tianjin, Nanjing, Hankou, Hunan, and Jiangxi. Today, all the newspapers in Shanghai reported that Lu was unable to get up. Where did the rumors come from? It is very strange. I hereby reveal the current situation so that those who care about Chairman Lu can understand the truth. (Special dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) Lu Dai, Secretary-General of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, issued a telegram saying that all newspaper offices were shocked by the news of Chairman Lu's death in the Shanghai newspapers today. Chairman Lu previously suffered from cerebral congestion and was treated by Dr. Lu Wenzhao. His condition has improved day by day, and his diet is as usual. He needs about a few weeks of recuperation to fully recover. The rumors from the outside are all nonsense. (Special dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yesterday, the newspapers in Pingjin reported that Lu Dipin died of a stroke on the 16th.

<h3 id="e22">Steel Plant Contract Awaits Approval by the Legislative Yuan <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>The Plant Site Has Not Yet Been Determined</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Huang Jintao of the Mining Department of the Ministry of Industry said that the content of the steel plant contract will soon be submitted to the Executive Yuan for transfer to the Legislative Yuan for review and approval before it can be signed. It is expected that coal will be produced in one and a half years and steel will be produced in three years. However, the plant site has not yet been determined. From an economic point of view, the plant site should be located in Pukou, because the products can be directly loaded onto ships from the dock, which reduces the cost and can compete with foreign goods. If national defense is emphasized, the cost will be higher and it will not be able to compete with foreign goods. As a result, the plant we run ourselves is equivalent to not running it. Therefore, the plant site is very important and must be decided recently. The factory borrowed 10 million US dollars from the German company Xiwang. All the procedures of the contract have been negotiated. The internal organization of the steel plant is divided into nine departments: steelmaking, general affairs, technology, engineering, business, audit, and accounting. Each department is divided into two or three sections. The plant has one director, and each department and section has one director and section chief. The total number of workers is about 2,000. In order to prevent the director from abusing his power, the Ministry of Industry intends to make the audit and accounting departments independent and not subject to the director's control, and the ministry will directly supervise the accounts. The selection of the director and other personnel will also be submitted by the Ministry of Industry to the Central Government for appointment to show solemnity. (Special dispatch on the 18th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan has designated various committees to draft the criminal law. The general principles have been drafted.

<p>After the Resignation of the Papen Cabinet, Hindenburg Consults with Party Leaders on Forming a National Coalition Government, Hitler Insists on the National Socialist Party Forming the Cabinet</p>
<p>▲National Press Agency, Berlin, 17th - The German Papen Cabinet resigned to the President today. After accepting the resignation, the President ordered them to continue to handle political affairs as usual while he consulted with party leaders on whether to form a national coalition cabinet. He also instructed party leaders to stay in Beijing over the weekend to discuss the issue of a successor cabinet. Subsequently, the Presidential Palace announced that the President would meet with Center Party leader Kaas and National People's Party leader Hugenberg on Friday, and then meet with People's Party leader Tingeltai that evening. On Saturday, he would meet with National Socialist Party leader Hitler and Bavarian People's Party leader Scheffer for discussions.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Munich, 18th - According to Hitler's headquarters here, Hitler is unlikely to participate in President Hindenburg's consultations with party leaders on Saturday. He continues to insist on his previous declaration that the National Socialist Party must lead the government, otherwise he would prefer to stay out of it. He is preparing to gain full control at that time.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Berlin, 18th - President Hindenburg has been meeting with party leaders since this morning, but whether there are any new developments in the political situation is being kept secret. Whether the organization of a national unity government is possible depends on Hitler's meeting with the President tomorrow. If the National Socialist Party leader insists on obtaining the position of Chancellor, the hope of a national unity government will be dashed. At the same time, Hitler's close friends are advising him to accept important positions in the new cabinet that the President can offer. All newspapers believe that the new cabinet will not be very different from the old cabinet. The position of Minister of Defense will still belong to Schleicher, and Neurath will still be in charge of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>▲National Press Agency, Berlin, 17th - It is now believed that the success of a coalition cabinet depends on Hitler's attitude. However, Hitler is not yet willing to express his opinion, saying that he is preparing a written opinion to present to the President on Saturday. At this time, he can only declare that he opposes the Papen Cabinet's economic plan. Furthermore, the Social Democratic Party has already issued a letter with strong wording, declaring its refusal to discuss the issue of forming a talent-centered cabinet with the President. As for Berlin at this time, the people are calm, and it is rumored that the President has authorized Papen to continue to act indefinitely, so there should not be a period of chaos that traps the central government in a leaderless situation.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Reasons for Papen's Announcement of Resignation <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>When the Papen Cabinet resigned to the President, it issued a communique announcing the circumstances of its contacts with party leaders in recent days in an attempt to follow the President's wishes in organizing a coalition cabinet. It said that Papen had talked with various parties and hoped to form a cabinet with a very broad base. Unfortunately, there were no results. Although the National People's Party and the Bavarian People's Party welcomed any coalition cabinet as long as it could guide the country to resolve the current difficult situation, the Center Party indicated that under the leadership of the current cabinet leader, it may not be sufficiently strong to resolve the difficulties. The Social Democratic Party refused outright, and the National Socialist Party only agreed to continue negotiations in writing and would submit a memorandum opposing the current government's economic policy. It also said that the cabinet, given the difficulties of the situation, had been trying its best to seek the greatest welfare of the motherland since it accepted the important task entrusted by the President on July 1. Finally, it said that it has now returned its powers to the President. At this time of hardship, it cannot make any further personal plans, so the cabinet withdraws, allowing the President to freely gather the national strength in the position of national leader to solve the current crisis, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Confused Political Situation <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>▲Reuter, Berlin, 17th. The German political situation has become greatly turbulent. It is expected that the President will instruct the Minister of Defence, Schleicher, to form a cabinet. This could lead to a military dictatorship by Dikt. Before resigning, Papen received a letter from the National Socialist Party leader, Hitler, the contents of which have not been announced. However, it is rumored that Hitler is demanding to be appointed as Prime Minister as a condition for the National Socialist Party to join the government. President Hindenburg is said to strongly oppose this. President Kubon of the United States is also rumored to be a successor to the Prime Minister. However, Mr. Kubon may not be able to obtain more parliamentary support than Papen. If each party does not agree to form a national centralized or extra-party cabinet, the President may still instruct the current executive to continue. If so, the parliament will inevitably vote against it, and the question of how to avoid violating the constitution will arise. A National Socialist Party newspaper stated that Hitler is demanding the position of Prime Minister. Currently, a government that can occupy a majority in parliament must be formed by a combination of the National Socialist Party, the Centre Party, and the German National People's Party. However, the political views of these parties are fundamentally different. Observers of the political situation predict that Papen will become a dictator, but it is difficult to predict what will happen afterwards. Various sectors in Germany are very concerned about the current situation.</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, Berlin, 18th. The sudden resignation of the Papen cabinet has caused great shock, but the capital city appears to be very calm, and the national order has not been disturbed. According to various sources close to the President, the President has not yet made a decision on the candidate for the next Prime Minister. However, a powerful faction in the political circles believes that this position will be given to Hitler, with the agreement that the cabinet he organizes will be independent of the parliament but will still need the support of the parliament to resolve important issues. Other political observers say that no party leader has any hope of forming a cabinet at this time. It is expected that the President will entrust state affairs to someone with political experience and somewhat neutral. This kind of cabinet will recruit members from several political parties and be able to obtain the support of each party in the parliament when the time is right. Therefore, Dr. Barlach, who has been acting as a Prussian state affairs commissioner since July 20, special management commissioner Goerdeler, former Minister of Defence Dr. Geissler, former colonial governor Dr. Schnee (i.e., the German member of the League of Nations investigation team for the Sino-Japanese dispute), and current Minister of Defence General Schleicher have the highest voices. However, any such cabinet depends on the support of the National Socialist Party in the parliament. Otherwise, the National Socialist Party can propose a vote of no confidence at any time and obtain the support of the Communist Party to overturn it. The two parties occupy 296 seats in the 585-seat parliament. In short, the overall situation is very dangerous now, and the first decision is entirely in the hands of President Hindenburg.</p>

<p>Britain Agrees to Establish a Permanent Disarmament Committee</p>
<p>US Representative Willing to Continue Cooperation in Geneva</p>
<p>France Agrees to Fully Consider British Disarmament Proposals</p>
<p>▲Reuter, Geneva, 17th. British Foreign Secretary Simon stated in a speech to the main body of the Disarmament Conference today that Germany's request to reorganize its combat troops should be managed under a set of reorganization conditions and implemented in a way that does not contradict any arms limitations or reductions, and must not contain an increase in military aggression. The Foreign Secretary continued to say that the British government is deeply moved by President Hoover's proposals regarding the strength of the military and is prepared to accept them as the basis for discussion. The British government also accepts in principle the resolution passed by the Disarmament Conference on June 22 to establish a permanent disarmament committee, believing that the stipulation of effective supervision is essential for negotiating a disarmament convention. The Foreign Secretary also turned to Chairman Henderson and said, "We have reached a turning point in this conference. It is useless to engage in the details of the disarmament machinery without the spirit of peace. We are now working to consolidate international goodwill." The Italian representative strongly supported the disarmament proposals put forward by Foreign Secretary Simon, but said that if Germany is absent, these problems cannot be solved. US Representative Davis said that the Disarmament Conference has been meeting for ten months, and economic misfortunes are increasing. However, if there is a glimmer of hope for success, the US delegation is willing to continue working in Geneva. The French representative said that the British proposals will receive France's full consideration. The French representative reiterated the French policy previously stated by French Minister of War Peng Gu, and then briefly described France's disarmament plan.</p>
<p>▲Reuter, Tokyo, 18th. The Japanese political circles do not want to lightly comment on British Foreign Secretary Simon's disarmament speech before it is formally verified. However, the general impression is very good, especially for the Navy Department. According to a spokesman from the department, Simon's proposal on installing smaller artillery positions on battleships is in line with Japan's views. The spokesman also said that Japan advocates abolishing aircraft carriers but cannot agree to abolish submarines.</p>

<p>▲Reuter, Geneva, 17th. The League of Nations today issued a notification from Chinese representative Yan Huiqing, stating that according to reports from Hailar, the Japanese army's Matsuki Division, which had committed various atrocities during its operations in Shanghai, is now carrying out extremely cruel acts of rape, murder, and arson in northern Manchuria. On October 26, Japanese aircraft dropped bombs in Hailar, containing leaflets claiming that Zarantun, Boketu, Hailar, and Manchuria would be destroyed as flat ground using heavy artillery and bomber aircraft. It has been found that the above-mentioned locations are not within the war zone.</p>

<p>Small Countries' Anti-Japanese Movement Fierce</p>
<p>The Power of Major Countries Becomes More Important Daily</p>
<p>▲Den Tsushin, Geneva, 17th. The attitude of small countries towards the League of Nations General Assembly following the council meeting is noteworthy. Regarding the Manchuria issue, Spanish representative Madrid, who initially opposed Japan, recently began to advocate preventing the tyranny of major countries and began to cancel Japan's recognition of "Manchukuo" in order to implement a fierce movement of non-recognition of "Manchukuo." This is a reaction to the years of oppression of small countries by major countries, and South American countries all regard Spain as their motherland, so many small countries agree with Madrid's proposal. The only country among the small countries that has adopted a cautious attitude is Greece, and even Poland's attitude is very questionable. The power of major countries cannot be ignored. The biggest crisis of Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations may not require the efforts of small countries.</p>

<h3 id="e57">Japanese Government Publishes Opinion on the League of Nations <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Doing Its Utmost to Denigrate China</p>
<p>What Is Said Is Nothing More Than the Old Tune of the Japanese</p>
<p>▲Den Tsushin, Tokyo, 18th. The revised points of the Japanese government's opinion on the Lytton Report have been completely finalized. The original has arrived at the Japanese delegation in Geneva, and the procedures for submitting it to the League of Nations Secretariat have been completed. The outline of the opinion has been released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today, as follows:</p>
<p>Introduction: The Japanese are satisfied with the following two points in the Lytton Report: (1) It recognizes the fact that China is divided and chaotic and in a state of anarchy. (2) It recognizes that China's boycott of Japanese goods is encouraged and sponsored by the Nanjing government and is carried out by illegal means and violence. However, the judgment is made under evidence that is unfavorable to Japan and favorable to China. From the beginning of the dispatch of the Lytton Committee, it has held a priori subjective idea that the army of one country is invading foreign territory. What appropriate method is used to correct this, so that such an illegal conclusion can be obtained? The committee members may not understand Chinese and stayed for a short period of time, which may be one of the reasons.</p>
<p>Chapter 1: China. Although China is a country that was once unified and exists, it is now just a name for a vast region. However, although China is in a state of disunity and anarchy, Europeans and Americans cannot remove the concept of it existing as a country. The principle of territorial inviolability is sacred, but it can be applied to a country in a state of anarchy that is no longer a country. After the collapse of the last government that unified China, Yuan Shikai's republican government, China had no government existence, and the existence of the country also ceased at the same time. The agreement of the Washington Conference to recognize the existence of a unified government in China is the cause of China's decline. China is just a hope and an ideal, not a country at all. The countries only recognize the Nanjing government within the scope of its authority. Manchuria is naturally not within its scope. Even the Lytton Report does not recognize that Manchuria is under the command of the Nanjing government.</p>
<p>Chapter 2: Manchuria. Manchuria initially existed independently of the mainland of China. Although it was temporarily merged when the Qing Dynasty was established, it naturally separated after the Qing Dynasty died. The two generations of the Zhang family were not subject to any restraint from the mainland of China. In 1928, although Zhang Xueliang had some contact with the Nanjing government, the opportunity for independence naturally brewed among the people of Manchuria due to the tyranny of the two generations of the Zhang family.</p>
<p>Chapter 3: The September 18th Incident and Subsequent Military Actions. Although the committee recognizes the railway bombing, it does not say who did it. It also determines that the actions of the Japanese army exceeded the scope of self-defense. However, if Japan had taken emergency measures at that time, Japan would have been expelled from Manchuria. The committee's determination is biased towards China's explanation and does not know that the emergency situation between China and Japan is the result of the continuous aggressive attitude of China. The committee is indifferent to this level. It also says that the bombing of Jinzhou was inappropriate. Japan's actions were legitimate actions recognized by the Hague Convention.</p>
<p>Chapter 4: "New Country". The report seems to determine that the "new country" was created by the Japanese army, but it turns a blind eye to the fact that the Japanese government and military headquarters have strictly ordered that no Japanese, even individuals, are allowed to participate in the Manchurian political movement. The report also determines that the residents of Manchuria do not want to be under Japanese rule, but this cannot be interpreted as hoping to restore a state of anarchy and the rule of the Nanjing government. If the residents of Manchuria hope for the restoration of the Zhang regime, why was the Zhang regime expelled from Manchuria? The committee's determination that Japan created "Manchukuo" has not been carefully examined in this regard. The report recognizes that such a result exists under the presence of foreign troops, but this is limited to when foreign troops are hostile. For example, the Estonian revolution was carried out with the assistance of the US Navy, but it was immediately recognized. In short, "Manchukuo" is ruled by the Manchus, and even the Chinese welcome it because they can be stable.</p>
<p>Chapter 5: Conclusion. Chapters 9 and 10 of the report are based on the above-mentioned errors. In particular, the establishment of "Manchukuo" and the investigation by the investigation committee have changed the situation at that time, so the instructions have no value for solving the problem. Based on the above reasons, it is believed that the fundamental solution to the Sino-Japanese dispute requires the correct understanding of the reality of China and Manchuria by the countries and the nurturing of "Manchukuo" in order to maintain lasting peace in the Far East and world peace.</p>
<p>The gist of the Japanese government's opinion is nothing more than (1) slandering China as not being a country, (2) recognizing that Manchuria has no relationship with China, (3) the so-called new country was not created by Japan, and (4) accusing the League of Nations report of insufficient understanding. These kinds of absurd and irrational fallacies that ignore facts and disregard justice have long been extensively publicized, and this newspaper has repeatedly refuted them in articles, so there is no value in debating them again. However, today it is actually using this kind of extremely unreasonable and absurd fallacy to form the official documents of the League of Nations. The denunciation of our country not only does not slightly take into account international etiquette, but also uses fabrication to the fullest extent, no different from a rogue cursing. Instead of reflecting on its own internal disturbances and incessant assassinations and mergers, it boasts to be better than our country. It is so inconsiderate and unrestrained. This is what is called unbearable! How can it not make our people more outraged? As for its conclusion that the facts of Manchuria and China should be recognized to maintain peace in the Far East, we dare to ask the League of Nations: If the League of Nations can indeed abolish the Covenant and the Nine-Power Treaty and the Non-War Treaty, then it can recognize what it calls the current facts. If it cannot, what reason will it have to recognize its facts? League of Nations members, please think carefully.</p>

<p>Hoover Agreed to Meet at the White House Next Week by Phone</p>
<p>Hoover Will Also Convene Congressional Leaders to Discuss Together</p>
<p>Democratic Policy Based on the Principle of "One With One Take"</p>
<p>Reducing Tariffs as an Essential Plan for the International Economy to Recover</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, Albany, 17th. Roosevelt reported to President Hoover in person on the phone today that he was prepared to arrive in Beijing at 3:45 pm next Tuesday and go to the White House to meet him, and expressed his eagerness to cooperate. After Mr. Roosevelt decided to enter Beijing, he would publish a part of his foreign policy, believing that high tariffs and foreign debts were interrelated. If tariffs could be reduced together, trade could be promoted and the debtor countries could also have the strength to repay foreign debts. He believed that the international policy of the Democratic government should be based on "one with one take" to exchange benefits with other countries, believing that there are many interests that one country can exchange with another, and the result can at least limit the damage to its own interests. Unfortunately, everyone has ignored them now. Reducing tariffs is the first priority of this policy and an essential plan for the international economy to start on the road to recovery. If foreign countries can sell their goods, they can also buy goods and have the surplus to repay debts. He also said that he would convene a special meeting of Congress after taking office, at which time he would publish his entire policy.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Opposition in Parliament <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>▲National News Agency, Washington, 17th. Since Roosevelt accepted the invitation and scheduled to enter Beijing, neutral observers now believe that the two presidents will be able to agree with the leaders of the two parties on a plan that can be accepted by Congress. Hoover and Roosevelt will probably start discussing on Tuesday night, and if the two can agree on the war debt issue, they will convene congressional leaders the next day to propose suggestions for joint discussion. It is heard that Hoover has summoned three Republican leaders of the Senate Finance Committee, Smots, Watson, and Reed, to meet on Wednesday. At that time, three Republican leaders of the House Ways and Means Committee, Halle and others, will also participate, and their purpose is to solicit opinions from Congress on the extension of the suspension period and proposals, and on how to raise money to offset the debts due next month after the debtor countries suspend payments.</p>
<p>▲Reuter, Washington, 17th. House Democratic Leader Reni said today that any proposal to extend the repayment period of European war debts owed to the United States will not be easy to gain the support of the House. The general opinion of the House and its leaders can be seen. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Linoz also said that the House does not approve of any changes to the existing agreement. Another important figure in the Democratic Party, McFatty Light, also opposes modifying war debts, saying that President Hoover's deferred payment plan failed in the national vote and that he could not continue to follow this, so he does not want to propose another extension.</p>
<p>▲Reuter, Washington, 17th. Republican Congressman Sheridan declared today that if the major European countries do not pay the debts due to the United States in mid-December, he will submit a resolution ordering the announcement that each country is unable to repay the debt and has entered bankruptcy, so it cannot be responsible for international trade and diplomacy. It is said that if the countries do not fulfill their debts, Mr. Sheridan will ask the Hague World Court to make this declaration.</p>
<p>▲Reuter, Salt Lake City, 18th. Republican Senator Smuder expressed his opinion on the war debt issue today, saying that if any country fails to clear its debts in accordance with the debt repayment agreement, the United States may conclude a reorganization law with each debtor country, but it should also be based on its ability to pay. It is an attitude of wanting Europe to repay its debts.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Debts Due Must Be Paid <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>▲Reuter, Washington, 17th. The State Department notified the French and Belgian ambassadors that the US government is not yet prepared to reply to their governments' requests to extend the debt repayment period and modify war debts. There is also news from New York that the United States will insist that Europe pay the debts due in December. The New York Tribune reported that President Hoover had discussed with his advisors and heard that if Europe wants to consider modifying the debt repayment conditions, it should first pay the debt due in November. According to the opinion of Hoover's friends, if Roosevelt does not agree to restore the Debt Repayment Committee during the meeting at the White House tomorrow, Hoover will abandon the proposal to restore the committee.</p>
<p>Reuter, London, 17th. The war debt issue still seems to be shrouded in haze in various markets. The London Stock Exchange and various commodities exchanges have limited transactions and prices are difficult to maintain. British government bonds continued to close slightly lower than yesterday. German government bonds also fell due to the political turmoil caused by Papen's resignation. The trend on Wall Street is uncertain.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Indian Round Table Conference <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>▲Reuter, London, 17th. British Prime Minister MacDonald presided over the preparatory meeting of the Indian Round Table Conference in the Upper House today. The British Prime Minister spoke to welcome the representatives to return and hoped that this work would satisfy everyone, saying that the British government is willing to do everything it can to promote the success of this meeting without hesitation. Now that the representatives know each other's intentions, they will be able to resolve everything in a practical manner and complete their work leisurely before Christmas. He himself may not be able to attend the meeting often, but whenever the British government representatives feel it is necessary and put forward the government's practical opinions, these opinions can be regarded as his own and his cabinet members' opinions. Aga Khan, the representative of Indian Muslims, delivered a speech on behalf of all the Indian representatives, saying that the Indian representatives came to London with the desire for success. He hoped that a conclusion could be reached before Christmas to establish a suitable constitution that can satisfy the desire of the Indian people to govern together. Indian Affairs Minister Hall said that the purpose of this general meeting is to discuss issues that have not been fully studied and avoid repeating previous discussions. He hoped that this meeting could end around December 20 so that the government could consider the proposals, and the parliamentary joint committee could carry out its work as soon as possible during the next session of Congress.</p>

<p>Postponed Until the Next Cabinet Meeting to Decide</p>
<p>▲Den Tsushin, Tokyo, 18th. Today's regular cabinet meeting was held at the Prime Minister's official residence in Nagata-cho at 10:30 a.m. Prime Minister Saito and all cabinet members attended. After deliberating on the original draft of the Ministry of Finance's investigation of next year's budget, the overall estimates were generally decided. Among the revival requests of various ministries, such as the Ministry of Internal Affairs' port and river modification expenses, there are continuing expenses and extending to the fiscal year of Showa 10 and beyond, so the government intends to limit the budget for rescuing the current situation to the fiscal year of 9. Regarding this point, the financial authorities and related ministries will contact each other again, and the budget has not been formally decided. In addition, Foreign Minister Utida felt that the expenses of overseas ambassadors were insufficient due to the sharp fall in foreign exchange rates and hoped that Finance Minister Shangqiao would give appropriate consideration, and Finance Minister Takahashi also agreed to give consideration to it, so the meeting was adjourned at noon. Therefore, the cabinet meeting on the 22nd will formally decide on the entire outline of the budget, as follows (unit: 1,000 yen): Income: Ordinary Department 1,288,310, Temporary Department 949,650, Ordinary Revenue 53,250, Public Debt Revenue 896,400, Total 2,237,960. Expenditure: Ordinary Department 1,357,390, Temporary Department 880,570, Total 2,237,960.</p>
<p>▲Den Tsushin, Tokyo, 18th. Finance Minister Takahashi went to the official residence today to meet with Prime Minister Saito, where he expressed his belief in improving finances. Regarding the establishment of a financial investigation committee within the government, it was difficult to express approval immediately, saying that there was still room for careful consideration. The Prime Minister also agreed to study the proposal, so the cabinet meeting today suspended the inquiry on the proposal.</p>
<p>▲Den Tsushin, Tokyo, 18th. The Navy Ministry's budget for next year has been finalized, and its outline is as follows (unit: 1,000 yen): Total amount of ordinary expenses 178,822, Total amount of temporary expenses 93,783, Main items: Ordinary expenses: New warship construction expenses 15,195, Expenses for increasing the number of regular staff 290, Expenses for aviation squadron aviation weapons, etc. 15,594, Increase due to exchange rate fluctuations 6,138, Temporary expenses: Additional warship construction expenses 15,000, Maintenance expenses for each workshop 5,394, Expenses for warship modification 26,088, Expenses for weapon enrichment 21,710, Expenses for the preparation of military supplies 5,000, Expenses for major exercises 500, Manchurian Incident expenses 15,474, Increase due to exchange rate changes 6,565.</p>

<p>Instructs on Bandit Suppression Strategies</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The communist bandits Xu Xiangqian and He Long joined forces two months ago and roamed through Suixian, Fancheng, and Guanghua in northern Hubei, splitting into three routes to infiltrate Shaanxi. One route was blocked and forced to return, fleeing to the border of Henan. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, in order to completely eradicate the bandit menace, specially dispatched eight divisions led by Hu Zongnan, Liu Maoen, Liu Chunlin, Xiao Zhichu, Fan Shisheng, Li Mo'an, Li Sizhuo, and Liu Kan (formerly General Fu Sheng) to encircle and suppress them. He also ordered the Shaanxi army to block key points, aiming to completely eliminate the remaining bandits within the current month. The bandits, facing a life-or-death situation, engaged in fierce battles with the National Army along the way. The Xu bandits are currently in the Kangjiaping and Renling Mountains, west of Zhaojia Street and east of Manchuan Pass. The First Division of the National Army under Hu Zongnan has advanced to the line of Sanshidian, Leiyin Temple, Qiliyanz, and Tianpeng Mountain. A part of the Eleventh Route Army has advanced to the line of Mahui River, Dagukou, and Dang Mountain. The 44th Division under Xiao Zhichu has advanced to the line of Zhangjiazhuang and Majiawan. The 51st Division under Fan Shisheng has advanced from the west to Tumen Town and Xiaxiangkou Town. The Shaanxi army is guarding the vicinity of Manchuan Pass with one brigade, and another brigade has advanced south from Shanyang to Shiyao, having established contact with other armies to encircle the bandits. The area has been experiencing cold rainy and snowy weather for days, and the officers and soldiers, barefoot and in thin clothing, are eagerly pursuing and suppressing the bandits, enduring hardships. The bandits are now trapped in the center of the encirclement with no way to escape but still rely on their large number of over ten thousand (some say Xu and He have a total of forty thousand) with complete weaponry to attempt a breakout to the west. In the coming days, there will be more bloody battles between the soldiers and bandits. The bandits fleeing to Henan are He Long's fake Seventh and Eighth Divisions. The fake Eighth Division has fled to Shuanghe Town in the northwest of Tongbai County, and the fake Seventh Division has fled to Haozhai in the southeast of Fangcheng County. Ma Hongkui dispatched Ma Yingcai's brigade to suppress them, defeating the bandits separately. In the battle of Haozhai, the fake Seventh Division Commander Tan Su and two fake regimental commanders, Sun Lingzhong and Shen Rong, were killed on the spot. Over three hundred bandits were killed and countless wounded. The remaining bandits have fled to the Shitouzhai at the junction of Nanyang and Fangcheng, where Ma's brigade is in hot pursuit. Judging from the current bandit situation, it is easier to eliminate He's bandits in southern Henan, while Xu's bandits are trying to penetrate deep into central Shaanxi to cross the Wei River and flee north. If they succeed, the communist disaster will spread to the northwest. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is determined to eradicate the bandits completely. In order to understand the military situation on the front lines, he departed from Hankou by his private plane at 10:00 AM on the 17th to inspect the area of Laohekou. Zhang Jianmeng, captain of the Sixth Aviation Squadron, piloted a plane in advance. It was reported that he had arrived there at noon and immediately summoned He Chengjun and other generals to instruct them on strategies. He is expected to return to Hankou by the original plane on the 18th or 19th and then go to Jiangxi for inspection at a later date. Zhang Xueliang, who came to Hankou to meet Chiang, will return to Beiping after Chiang returns to Hankou. Zhang has come to Hankou twice recently. The first time was on the 10th of this month, arriving from Pingnan by air and staying in Hankou for three days, meeting Chiang twice. On the 13th, he went to Hangzhou for sightseeing. The second time he came to Hankou to meet Chiang once. Zhang stays at the Central Bank when not busy and often amuses himself with little Gaoerfu. (November 17th)</p>
<h3 id="e69">Bandit Activities Flare Up Again in Rizhao <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The bandit leaders Yu Gongfang, An Fengduo, Zheng Guohong, and Zheng Tianjiu in Rizhao gathered crowds to wreak havoc on the 15th of last month, killing, setting fires, and looting civilian self-defense firearms, almost spreading throughout the county. Subsequently, Zhan Shutang, commander of the 81st Division stationed in Yishui, led his troops to suppress them, and the bandit forces were defeated and fled into the mountains. Commander Zhan pursued them repeatedly, killing over two hundred bandits. All the important bandit leaders fled. Commander Zhan, in addition to offering rewards for their capture, also left a battalion of soldiers to be responsible for rural pacification. Commander Zhan himself then quickly returned to Yishui with his troops to prevent further incidents. Unexpectedly, after Commander Zhan returned to defend, the remnants of the bandits revived. Recently, they joined forces with local bandits in the western mountains, relying on the mountains and forests to kidnap and demand ransoms. The kidnapped women are kept as wives and not allowed to be redeemed. A daughter of the Ma family in the Naxiang Quanzi area was kidnapped a few days ago. The Ma family prepared 1,500 yuan, intending to redeem their daughter, but the bandits kept 500 yuan and returned the remaining 1,000 yuan, saying it was a bride price for taking her as a wife. A daughter of the Qin family in Xinzhuang was also kidnapped by the bandits and her whereabouts are still unknown. The total number of women kidnapped from other villages is no less than several dozen. The bandits secretly sent their associates to incite unemployed people to join them, and many have joined. On the 10th of this month, the bandits held a meeting at the Nanshan Temple in Shanyuhe, attended by over two thousand people. After the meeting, they split into groups to kidnap and loot, looting Dashetou Village, Gao Village, Jin Village, Ma Village, Dapo Village, Xinliu Village, and Houtushan Village, and kidnapping over forty men and women. Wang Jiajue's family in Wangjia Village, a village about a mile away from Jiacang Town, was also quite wealthy and was recently kidnapped and ransomed for 10,000 yuan, which has not yet been redeemed. It is reported that the bandits are still being commanded by An Fengduo and Zheng Tianjiu. Currently, the people of Rizhao cannot sleep peacefully. Those with assets have already fled, and only middle and lower-class families remain, unable to leave and subject to the bandits' control. If the authorities do not quickly suppress them, they may become a major problem. (November 16th)</p>

It was held in Shanghai the day before yesterday. The county magistrates and local representatives from Nan, Feng, and Shang counties attended, but Songjiang was absent.

The results of the exploration are as follows: ㈠ Because the magistrate of Songjiang County and its representatives submitted reasons for not attending, this meeting considers it difficult to formally discuss the matter for the time being. The Taiping Township part of the four-county boundary issue is the most important. Nan and Feng counties should first negotiate a solution and report it to this meeting, which will then convene another meeting. ㈡ Songjiang should still be invited to attend the next meeting.</p>

Since the abolition of the Chongguan customs revenue in the 18th year of the Republic (1929), they have relied on a monthly subsidy of 50,000 yuan from the central government to barely maintain. In recent months, the central government has not issued the subsidies as scheduled, and Beiping's finances are extremely difficult, resulting in teachers' salaries being in arrears for several months. The teachers are unable to make a living, so they have specially sent representatives to Nanjing to urge the issuance of subsidized funds, hoping that the central government will consider the tens of thousands of students in primary and secondary schools in Beiping and immediately allocate funds to maintain them.</p>

<p>▲ It is scheduled to continue the petition next Monday</p>
<p>The Joint Association of Private Primary and Secondary Schools in the French Concession petitioned the Taxpaying Chinese Association a few days ago to request subsidies from the French Municipal Council. The details have been published in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the association sent executive directors Ma Jiazhen, Hong Guang, and Mao Zhaorong to the residences of Du Yuesheng and Zhu Yan, the Chinese directors of the French Municipal Council, yesterday afternoon to petition. However, Du and Zhu were out, so there was no result. It has now been decided to continue the petition at 2:00 PM next Monday.</p>
<h3 id="e98">The Municipal School Implements Hygiene Work <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>▲ It will start next Monday</p>
<p>Li Ting'an, Director of the Municipal Health Bureau, and Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, discussed and decided on a method of proceeding, given the importance of school hygiene. Sun Jiaqi, Director of the School Hygiene Section of the Health Bureau, will begin work next Monday. A Central News Agency reporter interviewed Li Ting'an, Director of the Health Bureau, yesterday to inquire about the methods of carrying out school hygiene. According to Li, school hygiene is extremely important, and the learning ability of students will be greatly affected if it is not properly promoted. Although the school hygiene work in this city has been gradually expanded to 20 schools four years ago, it is still far from the number of schools in this city. This is due to funding issues that are still being planned and promoted. However, since the January 28th Incident, the bureau's funding has been tight, and many students have suspended classes, so the work has been temporarily suspended. The Education Bureau and schools in this city attach great importance to this cause, so the results of cooperation over the years have been quite good. This year, the Education Bureau has also stipulated that it is the annual Health Education Center, so after taking office, I believe that this cause can no longer be delayed and I am determined to resume and promote it. I have now discussed it with Director Pan of the Education Bureau and received his approval. It will be implemented in the near future, and it is planned to implement school hygiene in the municipal schools in the Nanshi, Zhabei, and Gaoqiao districts as the first phase, totaling 67 schools with approximately 20,000 students. The promotion method is that the school authorities are responsible for the central responsibility, and the Health Bureau will send specially trained personnel to plan and guide them to facilitate implementation. The technical aspects will also be handled by personnel sent by the Health Bureau. The work that should be done includes physical examinations, early treatment, and correction of physical defects, such as instilling hygiene knowledge and training to develop good hygiene habits, such as cleaning up the school environment to avoid harming the health of students, such as improving nutrition to avoid causing anemia or lung disease, such as using various methods to develop health levels and enhance learning ability. Sun Jiaqi, Director of the School Hygiene Section of this bureau, has been sent to Nanjing last week to investigate and is expected to return to Shanghai around Saturday of this week, and will start work next Monday. Li also said that it is rumored that the funding for this work is borne by the American oil king, etc. This is a rumor and is wrong. This bureau has not received any subsidies from the oil king. Only when the school hygiene and rural hygiene work in the Gaoqiao district were established in this city in the 18th year of the Republic of China, the International Health Society subsidized all the start-up costs and the first year's recurring expenses and half of the second year's recurring expenses. This was discussed and obtained by the former Director Hu. As for the nature of the International Health Society, it can also be said for you by the way that the society is allocated a large fund by the oil king to subsidize medical and health undertakings in various countries. If an application is made to the society for a subsidy of funds, it can be approved for a considerable subsidy after the society considers it appropriate. This situation is not limited to any country. Many medical or health undertakings in various countries have received their assistance. The restoration of school hygiene this time is all funded by the municipal government and is the responsibility of the Education and Health Bureaus, and there is no subsidy from the society.</p>

<p>│Three Games Starting at 5 PM Today│</p>
<p>In yesterday afternoon's first and second team games of the Chinese Women's Basketball Association, the Southeast team achieved a double victory. The second team won against Xiaguang with a score of 39-6, and the first team won against Jiangnan with a score of 54-15. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲Second Team: Starting at 5 PM, Southeast Second Team and Xiaguang began their contest. The Southeast team had well-coordinated and accurate shooting, with forwards Zhang Jian and Ms. Liao Zhuyuan being particularly valiant. The Xiaguang team also showed commendable fighting spirit, but their talent was unevenly distributed, leading to a sense of helplessness. Forward Zhuang Lingzhao also showed promise. In the first half, Southeast scored 16 points, and Xiaguang scored 3 points. Southeast won with a final score of 39-6.</p>

The back-and-forth action only saw the Jiangnan women exert their abilities, and the score difference widened rapidly. In the first quarter, Southeast scored 22 points, while Jiangnan only scored 5 points. Starting from the second quarter, Jiangnan tightened their defense and were more cautious, making the situation more tense. By the end of the first half, Southeast led with a score of 34-7.

<h3 id="e108">West Qing Basketball Game Last Night: Chizhi Achieves a Crushing Victory Over Yeshi <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>! 57-34 !</p>
<p>▲ Jiangwan Team Submits to Mailing</p>
<p>▲ Hujiang Affiliated Middle School Suffers a Miserable Defeat Against Rowing</p>
<p>│Six Games Tonight│</p>
<p>Yesterday was the second night of the West Qing Basketball League. In the two First Team games, Jiangwan lost to Mailing with a score of 21-40, while Chizhi defeated Yeshi with a score of 57-34. Both situations were one-sided, reducing the excitement. However, in the Second Team game between Hujiang Affiliated Middle School and Rowing, the competition was fierce and captivating. In the end, due to a tactical error, Hujiang lost by one point with a score of 40-39, a deeply regrettable outcome.</p>
<p>▲ Jiangwan Loses to Mailing: Jiangwan's defeat to Mailing was entirely due to their poor shooting accuracy and weak coordination. They often resorted to long-range shots, wasting effort and achieving nothing. Although Mailing initially held an advantage, they only gained two or three points, with the score at 10-6 and 12-9. However, when Brown replaced Maolai as the left forward, the situation changed dramatically. Brown scored three consecutive shots, resulting in a halftime score of 21-13, with Mailing leading by eight points. In the second half, Jiangwan showed little improvement, while Mailing, with Bieshepai as center, continued to score, surging ahead. Jiangwan only managed to score three field goals and two free throws in the second half.</p>
<p>▲Mailing Fouls and Scores ▲Jiangwan Fouls and Scores</p>
<p>Luo Ai (Right Forward): 2 fouls, 4 points. Wang Changyun (Right Forward): 0 fouls, 2 points.</p>
<p>Maolai (Left Forward): 1 foul, 4 points. Lin Bingwu (Right Forward): 0 fouls, 2 points.</p>
<p>Brown (Left Forward): 3 fouls, 12 points. Ma Canfeng (Left Forward): 0 fouls, 3 points.</p>
<p>Qin Bo (Center): 2 fouls, 7 points. Chen Puming (Left Forward): 0 fouls, 0 points.</p>
<p>Li Fu (Center): 0 fouls, 3 points. Zhang Jinxiang (Center): 3 fouls, 9 points.</p>
<p>Bieshepai (Guard): 0 fouls, 8 points. Xie Baochang (Center): 0 fouls, 0 points.</p>
<p>Halitai (Guard): 0 fouls, 2 points. Song Bihou (Guard): 2 fouls, 1 point.</p>

<p>Halftime: Mailing 21 points, Jiangwan 13 points.</p>
<p>Second Half: Mailing 19 points, Jiangwan 8 points.</p>
<p>▲Hujiang Loses by One Point: Although the game between Hujiang Affiliated Middle School and Rowing was a Second Team match, it was more exciting than the First Team game. Hujiang Middle School was the champion team of the previous Second Team league. Although most of their players had graduated to university, the new young players were still able to carry on the team's former glory. The three forwards cooperated well, with quick movements and accurate shooting, especially Chen Weimin. Initially, the team appeared flustered due to a lack of experience, and Rowing took the lead with a score of 5-0, then 7-2, and 22-8, creating a dominating atmosphere. However, Hujiang gradually regained their composure and skill, surpassing Rowing with a score of 13-11. They continued to score, winning the first half with a score of 25-14. In the second half, Hujiang continued their smooth performance, reaching a maximum score of 35-22. However, in the last five minutes, Zhang Zhaochang was substituted in. Zhang was a new player and had not faced such a large audience before. With two minutes remaining, Hujiang was still leading by eight points with a score of 39-31. Unexpectedly, disaster struck, and Rowing scored five consecutive goals, winning by one point, leaving the audience in disappointment. The hope for the championship suffered a blow, and they hoped that John could avenge them.</p>
<p>▲Rowing Fouls and Scores ▲Hujiang Fouls and Scores</p>
<p>Gao Tejin (Right Forward): 0 fouls, 9 points. Yu Xun'guang (Right Forward): 3 fouls, 4 points.</p>
<p>Haixueke (Left Forward): 2 fouls, 10 points. Zhang Zhaochang (Right Forward): 0 fouls, 0 points.</p>

<p>Total: 6 fouls, 40 points. Total: 4 fouls, 39 points.</p>
<p>First Half: Rowing 14 points, Hujiang 25 points.</p>
<p>Second Half: Rowing 26 points, Hujiang 14 points.</p>
<p>▲Chizhi Shows its Edge: Chizhi's victory over Yeshi was easy and lacked competition. Chizhi did not weaken due to Kong Guangyi's departure, and Guo Zhen was able to perform his duties well. However, their sole focus on offense often left the defense empty, which is not suitable against strong opponents. Yeshi, except for Zheng Zhifang, was unable to shoot, and their defense was loose, sometimes offering little resistance. Chizhi maintained the lead throughout the game, with the score always exceeding by ten points. The halftime score was 27-10, and the final score was 57-34.</p>
<p>▲Chizhi Fouls and Scores ▲Yeshi Fouls and Scores</p>

<p>│New Peak of 762 Taels│</p>
<p>▲Unprecedented Sharpness Discovered: Yesterday's market suddenly surged forward, showing a sharpness unseen for days, breaking through the 760 tael mark. There were slight fluctuations in the middle, but unexpectedly, the market rose and fell in the morning, and then almost soared in the afternoon. The overall market had a turnaround of nearly ten taels, ultimately surging by nine taels. The initial opening rose because the American bank reported a drop in the base rate, and even though the major rate rose, it was due to frequent exchange rate drops, leading to a bullish sentiment. The cash flows of various firms differed slightly, and the foreign exchange was firm for British currency and stable for American currency, resulting in slight fluctuations in the gold price. At noon, news suddenly spread from foreign sources that the American budget had a large shortage of reserves for next year, possibly leading to a reversal to the silver standard, causing a sudden downstream shift. The afternoon market saw an increase in remittances, and Hengyu helped Guangbang to cover their short positions, along with other speculators rushing to cover, causing the market price to surge straight up, reaching a new high of 62 taels. Finally, many parties took the opportunity to sell off, causing a slight decline to the 60 tael border, leading short sellers to be pessimistic. Even December contracts, which had been advanced by Daxing Yongxiang Fuchang by dozens of contracts, were posted at 7 taels. The full-day situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>▲The opening price was good, rising by four taels. The January contract opened by four taels at 755.3 taels (before the market opened, goods were transacted at 56 taels). It was then learned that the silver prices on the American Flower and Silver Exchange had both reported small (one-sixteenth) gains. Fuyu, Daxing, Yongzhaofeng, Chang Hengyu, Yuan Yongxiang, and others were the first to compete to buy, continuing to increase by one and a half taels to 56.8 taels. Huifeng then quoted December American dollars at 625, Huabi quoted January at 6875, Zhejiang quoted February at 875, and Yuanheng, Yifeng Qianchangxiang, Dadecheng, and others sold off at 9:10 AM for four taels and four cents. Hengxing came in to buy, raising the price by one tael at 9:30 AM to five taels and four cents. The HSBC posted rates, announcing that the British gold rate was up 125, while the American dollar rate remained unchanged. Intraday rates such as December American dollars were 625, January 8125 to 75, and the first order for February was 19.75, which could be closed. The Dalian Gang, Yuanheng Fuxing Yongyuan Xingyong Futai Heng, Hengyu Zhaofeng Chang, and others sold off, suppressing the price by two taels, only around five or six cents, and by 10:00 AM it was at three and a half taels. There were not many purchases until after 11:00 AM when Yongfeng Yifeng Yongyuantai Hengchang Yongyuan Mao Yong and others bought in, and Huabi bought December American dollars at 6875, causing the price to rise again by one tael. At 11:50 AM, news of unfavorable long positions came, and sentiment suddenly turned weak. Traders were suddenly bearish, and Yuanchun Yifeng Yongyuan Mao Yong Hengyu Zhifeng Yongyuan Heng and others dumped, causing the price to be unsupported, falling one or three taels. The market closed at 52.2 taels at noon, falling to just over one tael.</p>
<p>▲The afternoon market was extremely bullish, rising by eight taels and nine cents. The afternoon market opened at 52.4 taels, followed by two taels and two cents (however, trading was very limited). Later, Hengyu Yuanchun Richang Zhifeng Yong Hengxing and others bought in, causing the price to rise by two or three taels. Then, the exchange rate rose again, with November American dollars at 625 and February at 875. At 3:00 PM, Hengyu Fuyu and others' buying interest grew stronger. It was said that they were covering the short positions for Guangbang Hengxing, and Yifeng also covered a lot. Until 3:15 PM, it broke through 60 taels, reaching 60 taels and seven cents. However, Fuchang Yuanheng Qianchangxiang Dadecheng and others released their long positions, falling back by one tael to 59.7 taels. Around 4:00 PM, Yifeng Hengyu competed again, and the American dollar was particularly strong, with this month's contract only closing at 375, causing another rise of two taels. At 4:10 PM, it reached 62 taels. Unexpectedly, Zhaofeng Chang Yifeng Yong Hengchang Yong and others sold off, and since November American dollars came out at 4375, the market closed at 4:30 PM at 60 taels and two cents, continuing to rise by 8 taels and 9 cents compared to the previous evening. According to the daily quoted price, the highest was 62 taels and the lowest was 52.2 taels (according to the posted price), with a difference of 9 taels and 8 cents. The red strip was estimated to be added 16 taels.</p>
<p>▲The quoted price was slightly suppressed by nine taels. The quoted price was still estimated at 820 taels, with a squeeze of 65-6 taels. The midday close was 68 taels, the afternoon was 68 to 58 taels, and the final was 60 taels, a squeeze of nine taels less than the previous day. There were double closing prices, with the spot price at 59 taels this month, 58 taels next month, and 52 taels in January. The afternoon spot price was 67 taels this month, 66 taels next month, and 60 taels in January, with a supplementary water of 58 taels and 66 taels in the afternoon.</p>
<p>▲Short sellers rushed to cover, and long positions emerged. There was quite a lot of trading on the surface. Short sellers rushed to cover, and many long positions took the opportunity to emerge. Statistics show that Hengyu Zhifeng Yong bought 4-500 contracts, Yuan Mao Yong, Yuanmao, Hengxing, Yifeng Yong, Fuchang, Yuan Tai, and Shenkang all entered over 100 contracts, and Yongfeng, Fuyu, and Hengchang Yong all entered smoothly. Wanxing Yuanheng, Qianchangxiang, and Dadecheng all sold 3-400 contracts, and Futai Heng and Zhaofeng Chang all sold. In the afternoon, Hengyu entered over 4,000 contracts, Zhifeng Yong, Yongfeng, Yuanchun, Fuyu, Yuanxing Yong, Futai Heng, Bingxing, and Tianfeng Yong all entered. Wanxing, Shunli, Qianchangxiang, Yifeng Yong Zhaofeng Chang, Fuchang, Yuanheng, and Hengchang Yong all exited, Dadecheng, Yuanda, and Yuan Mao Yong were very busy, Dalian Gang sold a total of 1,6-700 long positions and bought over 200 contracts, Guangbang Hengxing entered 100 plus contracts and exited 100 plus contracts, and Hengyu entered 3,000 plus contracts on behalf, to cover previous short positions, and Yifeng entered over 1,000 contracts on its own.</p>
<h3 id="e116">American Exchange Rate is Uniquely Strong, While British Currency Continues to Weaken <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>│Trading is Mostly in American Currency, Less in British Currency│</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silver market diverged, with British currency rising and American currency falling, and the exchange rates repeatedly weakened. The exchange market in the city also went against the trend. The HSBC posted that the British gold rate rose by 125, while the American dollar rate remained unchanged. Indian rupees were cheap, and French and German currencies were expensive, while Hong Kong and Dutch currencies remained the same. The intraday British rate was loose and tight, mainly due to the frequent decline in the exchange rate.

Silver companies entered and exited before and after, and banks also conducted interbank trading. As a result, the price was reduced by 25 compared to the previous day. The trading details are recorded below:</p>

<h3 id="e118">Fluctuations in Foreign Silver <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign silver market appeared outwardly lower than the previous day, but in essence, it remained firm. This was because customer sales had not ceased. Although the supply was abundant, it was all being scraped together, and there would eventually be a day when resources were stretched thin. Fortunately, at present, banks could buy and sell as much as they wanted, so there were no other obstacles. If the banks only bought and did not sell, or only sold and did not buy, the strength or weakness of the market and the rise and fall of prices could be seen immediately.</p>
<p>▲ Decline in Silver Price, Continued Rise in Silver Discount (Foreign Silver) Yesterday morning, the price of silver suddenly decreased by a small amount, two and a half mills, to 7 taels, 1 fen, 1 mill, 7 hao, 5 li. The afternoon market continued to decrease by seven and a half mills to 7 taels, 1 fen, 1 mill. As a result, the total decrease in the price between the two markets was 1 mill compared to the previous day. (Silver Discount) The opening of both the morning and afternoon markets was 6%, which was 1% better than the previous day. The silver market situation remained unfavorable, so the addition of water to the head only amounted to 3 or 4 fen. The current tight situation was not easily alleviated for the time being.</p>
<p>▲ Sudden Rise in Guangdong Coins, Return of Copper Coins Yesterday, the price of small Jiangnan silver coins was 6 taels, 1 fen, 7 li in both the morning and afternoon markets, a decrease of half a mill compared to the previous day. The volume of transactions was 4,500 yuan in the morning market and 2,000 yuan in the afternoon market. The price of small Guangdong silver coins remained stable in the morning market, the same as the previous afternoon at 6 taels, 1 fen. In the afternoon market, the price suddenly increased by 3 mills to 6 taels, 1 fen, 3 li. The volume of transactions was 110,000 yuan in the morning market and 95,000 yuan in the afternoon market. The price of copper coins increased by 2,000 cash to 401,000 cash. The transaction volume was more than 32,400 strings of cash, with a total silver value of 8,100 taels.</p>
<p>▲ Silver and Foreign Exchange Transactions are Both Slow in Settlement (Silver Transactions) Yesterday, the settlement of silver transactions at banks was relatively sparse. Chinese merchants settled 2.3 to 2.4 million in bills, foreign merchants settled more than 1.8 million in bills, margin transactions amounted to more than 1.5 million, special transactions amounted to 1.7 to 1.8 million, telegraphic transfers amounted to more than 400,000, and various goods, exchange taxes, miscellaneous items amounted to more than 1.0 million.

<h3 id="e119">Securities and Bond Prices are Increasingly Stagnant <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>│Minimal Fluctuations, Quiet Market Conditions│</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market conditions for various bonds at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange showed that only two types of spot goods, demobilization and troop reduction, were traded, totaling 8,000 yuan. There was no trading for any other types. The futures market was also increasingly stagnant in price, which was quieter than before. The atmosphere of buyers and sellers in the market was greatly dampened. All bonds only had sporadic inflows and outflows. The total turnover was 3,175,000 yuan, including 692,000 for salt tax, and more than 4 to 500,000 each for customs tax, unified tax, demobilization, and troop reduction, which were very quiet. Customs revenue was completely absent, and financial transactions were even more scarce. As for the trend of various bonds, it was even more stagnant than before. The prices in the morning and afternoon markets only fluctuated by two or three corners, which was the earliest seen in recent weeks, and even the fluctuations from the previous day were subtle. This was probably because it was almost the end of the month, and the surrounding situation had not changed at all. The market only had sporadic carry trade transactions, and major investors were all watching and not moving. The market conditions were becoming increasingly quiet, and the supply and demand were becoming increasingly balanced. Compared with the previous day, there were gains and losses, but the losses were more numerous, and the amount was only one or two corners. Only financial futures fell by nine corners less than last week.</p>

<h3 id="e120">New York Stock Market Hovering All Day <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>A report from the Sin Fung foreign firm indicates that the New York stock market was in a hovering state on Thursday. Initially, the announcement of dividends for power bonds and stocks was unexpected, so although wheat fell sharply by nearly two cents, the market was still firm. The fluctuations in various stocks throughout the city were minimal. Before the market closed, there was a slight rebound. Bonds fell due to the resignation of German Chancellor Papen, but rebounded later due to the stability of President Hindenburg's position. Transactions were increasingly scarce due to the stagnant market. The total number of transactions for the day was 700,000 shares. In addition, the brokers' loans announced this week totaled $344,000,000, a decrease of $16,000,000 compared to the previous week. The interest rates for 60-day and 90-day loans remained at 0.5%. The Dow Jones index is listed below:</p>
<p>| Index | Closing Price | Change from Previous Day |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| 30 Industrial Stocks | 62.96 | Down 0.28 |</p>
<p>| 20 Railway Stocks | 27.79 | Down 0.47 |</p>

<h3 id="e121">Increasing Short Selling in Yarn and Cotton Markets <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market is trending downward step by step, mainly due to the stagnation of current yarn sales and the lack of improvement in the international situation, which has softened people's hearts. The surrounding environment is deteriorating, so short sellers are increasing day by day. It is found that the daily turnover of cotton yarn from various groups is only 400 to 500 bales. It is difficult to be optimistic about the yarn market under such circumstances. In short, financial exhaustion and commercial depression make it difficult for prices to stabilize.</p>
<p>▲ People's Standard Falls by Six, Seven, Eight, Nine Cents The opening of the People's Standard was due to a slight drop in American cotton and a very small amount of actual demand in the market. The prices on the trading floor were quite scattered for various months. After noon, it was heard that there was not much business, and the prices for various months fell by another four, six, seven, nine cents. A certain manufacturer opened a large number of positions, and the recipients hedged a large amount in the futures market. It was found that 1,700 bales of Suilong were sold, 1,100 bales of Tongyu, 1,400 bales of Yichang, 850 bales of Gengfeng, 1,150 bales of Changfeng, and 1,500 bales of Xincheng. 2,350 bales of Mingde were bought, 900 bales of Shenxin, 500 bales of Dafeng, and 750 bales of Tonghe. The closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>| Standard | Closing Price | Change | Account Balance |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| People's Standard |  | Down Nine | Four, Six, Nine, Five, Zero |</p>
<p>| November | 1396 | Down Five | Three, Zero, Three, Zero, Zero |</p>
<p>| December | 1405 | Seven, Five, Six, One | Zero, Zero, Four, One, Four, Three, Nine, Six, One, Two, Five, Zero, Zero |</p>
<p>| January | 1412 | Eight, Nine, Seven, Four | Zero, Zero |</p>
<p>| Total |  |  | Two, Six, Zero, Eight, One, Zero, Zero |</p>
<p>▲ Stagnation in Sales of Current Yarn, Further Decrease in Sales Prices There is a large stagnation in the sales of current yarn. It is found that the total amount of yarn bought by various groups throughout the day is 549 bales. The market price has fallen by 5 to 7.5 cents. The Shenxin factory has opened 5,500 bales of 20-count Caihua, Dragon Boat, People's Bell yarn. The amount of yarn bought by each group is listed below: 450 from Sichuan, 5 from Wuhu, 5 from Ningbo, 10 from Nanjing, 10 from Shantou, 15 from Anqing, 48 from the Mainland, 5 from Guangdong, 55 from the trade, 85 from Jiangxi, and 1 from other places.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Cotton Market Still Able to Stand Firm <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market is still stable because of the lack of arrivals from various regions and the difficulty in loosening prices in the producing areas. The shorts can only offset their positions. Therefore, although the yarn market is tired and sluggish, the cotton market can stand firm alone. However, American cotton is still hovering. Only the price of gold is gradually increasing, and people's hearts are becoming more and more nervous. However, the price of yarn is trending downward and gradually finding new lows. Businessmen feel very distressed, and foreign firms are more vigorously purchasing raw materials. Therefore, it is difficult to see the cotton market as tired at present.</p>
<p>▲ Zheng Standard Alone Shows Stability The opening of the Zheng Standard was due to the flatness and softness of American cotton, but there was a lack of new short sellers in the market. The rise and fall of various months totaled 5 points. The market atmosphere was still stable in the afternoon, with a drop of 1 cent. The total transaction volume for the day was 45,500 dans. It was found that 1,500 dans of Hengchang were sold, 1,500 dans of Gengfeng, 1,100 dans of Yichang, 1,300 dans of Xiesheng, and 1,200 dans of Yuanda. 3,400 dans of Xincheng were bought, 1,500 dans of Taixing, 1,400 dans of Mingde, 1,100 dans of Changfeng, and 1,000 dans of Suilong. The closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>| Standard | Closing Price | Change | Account Balance |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| Zheng Standard |  | Down 0 | Five, One, Five, Two, Zero, Zero |</p>
<p>| November | 3120 | Up 1 | Zero, One, Zero, Three, Six, Zero, Zero |</p>
<p>| December | Six, One, Five, Zero | Down Five | One, Seven, Seven, Seven, Zero, Zero |</p>
<p>| January | Three, One, Two, Five | Zero, Five, Two, Five, Zero, Zero, Zero |</p>
<p>| Total |  |  | Eight, Three, Three, Two, Zero, Zero |</p>
<p>▲ Large Movement in Current Cotton Mill Purchases The current cotton business is gradually moving, and the mill demand is relatively strong. The sources are 1,251 bales of Yao cotton and 1,957 bales of Tong cotton.</p>
<p>Tongzhou Cotton 31.25 Hengfeng Mill entered 3000 bales of spot goods sent to the factory Xiasha Cotton 32.00 Hengfeng Mill entered 500 pieces of spot goods sent to the factory Tongzhou Cotton 51.25 Puyi Mill entered 1500 bales of spot goods sent to the factory Tiezi Cotton 28.75 Chongxin Mill entered 100 bales of spot goods sent to the factory Shaanxi Cotton 31.25 Tongxing Mill entered 105 pieces of spot goods sent to the factory Shaanxi Cotton 50.75 Shenxin Mill entered 804 pieces of spot goods delivered to the warehouse Taicang Cotton 29.50 Shenxin Mill entered 500 bales of spot goods sent to the factory Huoji Cotton 29.25 Shenxin Mill entered 2000 bales of spot goods sent to the factory Beixin Jing 29.25 Shenxin Mill entered 1000 bales of spot goods sent to the factory Xinken Cotton 30.75 Shanghai Mill entered 200 bales of spot goods sent to the factory Xinken Cotton 30.50 Shanghai Mill entered 300 bales of spot goods sent to the factory Shandong American Cotton 33.80 Guangqin Mill entered 200 pieces of spot goods sent to Wuxi</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton traders watched the market with mediocrity. It is estimated that futures fell by 2 to 5 points. Spot goods remained unchanged. British cotton futures rose by 2 or 3 points, and spot goods rose by 7 points. Egyptian cotton spot goods rose by 2 points. Indian cotton was closed. The original telegram is recorded on the left.

<p>▲ Yesterday, the source of Xiang Road in South Shanghai was slightly less, and farmers were also affected. The reason is related to the silver situation. The business in this street is not good. The foreign Du Jian group slightly moved, and the price increased by a corner. The Su Tong group quoted a fixed price, but there was no demand for early and late rice, and the price decreased by a corner.</p>
<p>▲ Yesterday, about 20 ships from various groups arrived. Shops in urban and rural areas slightly responded. The top-quality regular rice from Changxi North maintained its position. The price of ordinary Zhongguan rice increased by two corners. The arrival and sales of thin rice were balanced, and the price continued to be stable. The Luzhou pointed rice market did not have any honor or disgrace.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Strong Arrivals and Sales of Customer Xian Rice <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>│Five Thousand Newly Arrived Bags, Three Thousand Bags Sold│</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market was completely stagnant, while customer xian rice had strong arrivals and sales. More than 5,000 bags of Hunan rice and a small amount of Jiangxi rice arrived at the port. Customer groups had a strong appetite, especially the Fuzhou group. The Beiyang group had good sales in the local area, and the river was about to be closed, so it was necessary to stockpile some before the river was closed to prepare for the sales of the New Year's Day. Therefore, the appetite was gradually improving. Under the smooth handling of the two major groups in the north and south, the market seemed to have the potential to rise step by step. However, because the existing stock of customer xian rice had not been sold, and new goods were arriving, a large number of subsequent batches were on the way and could arrive one after another. Therefore, although the market was active, the price was flat and soft. High-quality rice was still firmly standing. Tongjin was taken away by the Beiyang group. 750 bags of Huji red rice were priced at 8 yuan, 1 jiao to 7 yuan, 8 or 9 jiao, and 80 bags of Jiyuan rice were priced at 10 yuan, 4 jiao, 5 fen. The Fuzhou group took away 65 bags of Jiangxi Jiwan rice priced at 8 yuan, 6 jiao, 1,500 bags of Huji oil rice priced at 8 yuan, 9 jiao to 8 yuan, 8 jiao, 5 fen, and 50 bags of Jijing rice priced at 8 yuan, 3 jiao. 285 bags of Yun Jing rice were priced at 7 yuan, 1 jiao.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Consistent Decline in the Post-Market of Marked Flour <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the market for each month showed a trend of near stability and far decline. The international wheat price fell by about 3, 4, or 5 jiao. People inside and outside the industry were naturally unstable. The current month tended to be stable due to the relationship of spot goods. The poor situation of the distant months due to the slight selling of Fufeng and the continued surplus of the international wheat market can be seen from this. Therefore, each distant month fell by about 1 point. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, the near and distant months were uniformly soft. It was rumored that Fufeng had imported foreign wheat and that the futures for the current month could be settled with a surplus (it was also rumored that the price of Australian wheat was loose to 3 taels, 4 qian, 5 fen). Therefore, the current month was gradually sold out, and the general idea of squeezing shorts was too much, resulting in great weakness. The market price fell step by step. The distant months, such as January and February, once entered the 7 qian gate, and after observing, followed the 4 qian, 5 fen foreign wheat again. If there were to be transactions, the market would be afraid of further changes. As a result, the current month fell sharply by 2 fen, December fell by 4 fen, January fell by 2 fen, 7 li, 5 hao, February fell by 2 fen, 5 hao, and March and April fell by 1 fen, 7 li, 5 hao.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Uniform Trend of Decline in Futures Wheat <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>After the opening of futures wheat yesterday morning and afternoon, each month generally showed a flat and tired trend. The quotation for foreign wheat fell again by a huge 3, 4, or 5 jiao. The surplus of international wheat production had not yet been resolved, and the road to gradual loosening was nothing more than an attempt to dump it in China. This situation was a hidden danger for the future. Therefore, although transactions in each month were not smooth, people's hearts had largely loosened. Fortunately, there were few real chips in the market, otherwise it would be unbearable to imagine. As a result, the current month fell by 2 fen compared to the previous day, January fell by 1 fen, and there was no rise or fall in February.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Chicago Wheat Bulls Take Profits <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>A report from Sin Fung Foreign Firm states that Chicago wheat fell by 1.5 to 1.875 points for each period on Friday due to bull profit-taking. On the 16th, a total of 20 million bushels were traded. The market prices on the 17th are listed below:</p>
<p>| Month | Closing Price | Change from Previous Day |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| December | 42.125 | Down 1.875 |</p>

<h3 id="e129">New Chaoqing Sugar Already Opened in the Sugar Market <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>│Ordinary Goods Priced at 9 Taels 6 Qian│</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a slight stabilization with the continued upward trend of the marked gold. The guild's pricing for 24 coarse sand white was 14 taels, 9 qian, 2 fen, 5 li for high-quality goods and 14 taels, 8 qian, 2 fen, 5 li for ordinary goods. 20 medium sand white was 14 taels, 3 qian, and 18 medium sand white was 14 taels. Only sporadic transactions occurred. No. 10 Dutch red was划划划 out by Changxing, a famous firm, at 11 taels 6 qian. Shaobang Tong Anhao opened a batch of New Chaoqing, which was ordinary in color and body, priced at only 9 taels 6 qian, and the receivers were not enthusiastic. Other goods were dull due to the weak market and lacked transactions.</p>
<h3 id="e130">The Market Sentiment for Nanbei Goods, Quanzhou Longans, and Bubbled Longans is Downward <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The sales of Quanzhou large-bubbled longans have been sluggish recently, and very few of the branded goods have been opened, because the firms still have a lot of stock on hand and dare not be greedy for inventory. However, the firms are still watching because the cost of the goods is still a concern for the owners and they are unwilling to discount them. It is heard that the Funan and Huaping have imported in succession by sea from Quanzhou, and it is found that there are more than 2,000 boxes of bubbled longans being transported, so the market situation is even more tired. The goods that were at the top tier in the previous market were extremely strong, but now there is a gradual accumulation and the sales are also reduced. The market sentiment is downward.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Silk, Tea, Factory, and Warp Doors Have Smooth Sales <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>│Yesterday, 65 pieces of Yellow and White Factory Warps were Shipped to Hangzhou│</p>
<p>The silk weaving factories in Hangzhou are now weaving winter silk, and the consumption of factory warps is increasing day by day. The silk factories, in view of the tired trend in the market price of factory warps, have telegraphed Shanghai to take the opportunity to purchase them, so the current goods have been transacted daily and the silk warps transported to Hangzhou are not deserted. Yesterday, a certain transportation company also undertook the installation of 65 pieces of yellow and white factory warps purchased by various silk factories in Shanghai to Hangzhou.</p>
<h3 id="e132">There is Still No Turnaround in Silk Sales in Europe and America <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, there was still no turnaround in the silk market of foreign firms in this port. The raw silk factories in the overseas market were still lazy to enter the market, and the silk prices became more tired. The telegrams from Shanghai did not see any turnaround, so the market was depressed.</p>
<h3 id="e133">The Inventory of African Green Tea is Thin and Low <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>According to informed sources, the inventories of north and south Africa, which are major sellers of Zhenmei green tea of ​​gongse in my country, have recently been depleted. However, due to the poor harvest of various agricultural products such as rice and wheat in the road this year, the economy has declined, and the purchasing power has been reduced. British and French merchants who are currently operating on the road have the momentum to take advantage of the time to handle the waxing Zhenmei, but because the tea prices in Shanghai have fallen too quickly recently, they are deeply afraid of buying expensively, and they mostly hold a wait-and-see attitude. If the market stabilizes, the sales of Zhenmei in the future will have a major development.</p>
<h3 id="e134">The Prices of Piece Goods and Overcoat Naps are Inconsistent <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the sales of overcoat naps have developed day by day, and the sales of men's and women's colored Chinese and Western suits have continued. However, the selling prices are inconsistent, depending on how large the inventory is and how strong the demand is. Most of the Western-style overcoat naps are sold at about 10 taels, and the market is very strong. The sales of women's overcoat naps with fresh patterns are also smooth. The overcoat naps of Chinese-style clothing on the main road have fallen by half, half of which is due to the influence of riding breeches overcoats and half due to the Great Reduction in business due to the war in the Guan Dong north port, and the prices of goods have been falling step by step.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Coal and Stove Coal Transactions are Booming <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The weather has turned cold in recent days, and stoves are being launched on the market, so the coal market is also heating up for stove transactions. Yesterday, the city mostly opened with white coal, with a total of about 1,800 tons. Hongqi coal was the strongest, and the asking price was also good, and the price of each ton rose by 2 qian and a half. The market for Shanxi coal was also good, and the under-the-counter price rose by 5 fen. The number of transactions for smoke coal and domestic coal did not rise, and the most transactions for Fushun coal of Japanese coal, with a price of 10 taels, 5 qian per ton.</p>

<h3 id="e155">The Second Batch of Volunteer Army Aid Team Members Departed Last Night <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>▲To Bengbu to Join the Second Detachment, Heading Directly to the Battlefield. The second batch of the Northeast Volunteer Army Aid Team has completed all procedures and departed last night at 11:00 PM on the Shanghai-Nanjing overnight express train. They will first go to Bengbu to join with their Second Detachment, and then head directly from Bengbu to the battlefield to serve the anti-Japanese volunteer army. The location will be determined after the team leader, Fei Jian, goes to Peiping to meet with various anti-Japanese generals. The team also issued a declaration yesterday, stating:</p>
<p>▲List of Names of the Second Batch Departing Members: The list of members departing in the second batch is as follows: Huang Zhong, Wang Mengying, Huangfu Jun, Ji Huobin, Duan Jiamo, Xu Shida, Ye Keze, Liu Junpeng, Lu Dongshan, Chen Zhaohai, Wei Faliang, and 80 members of the Second Detachment in Bengbu, totaling 92 people. They are led by the team leader and Chen Ruchen of the Second Detachment, carrying over 30 large pieces of various supplies, departing from Shanghai at 11:00 PM last night.</p>
<p>▲All Sectors Enthusiastically Donate: Yesterday, colleagues from the Yong'an First Cotton Mill in this city donated 20 silver dollars and 40 bolts of flannel to the team, along with over a hundred yards of slightly damaged flannel and an accompanying letter. Furthermore, the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association from all sectors of Hangzhou specially sent 135 pieces of confiscated Japanese surgical medical equipment yesterday, dispatching Executive Committee member Zhang Wanli to bring them to Shanghai and hand them over to the team. Other donors are as follows: Zhou Zige donated 2 silver dollars, Chengji Gong Rice Shop donated 1 silver dollar, Yangsentai donated 2 silver dollars, Ruihecheng, Tianfeng, Lao Yonghe, Chun Hexiang, Zhentai, Yuankang, Qun Yushanfang, Hualun, Zhaotai, Dachang, Wansheng, Jusheng, Xintianxiang, Xiesui, Fengtai, Yixingchang, Puli, each donating 1 silver dollar. He Hongtai, Erlingxuan, Zhuang Shunxiang, Yuanda, Hengde, Wang Renmao, Taifeng, Kecheng, Xinkangxiang, Wang Xintai, Tianchangxiang, Yuxingxiang, Xiudetang, Hongmaochang, Qingchangxiang, Sanyi, Yufengheng, Li Chuji, each donating 5 jiao.</p>
<p>▲The Team Issued a Declaration: Since the September 18th Incident, the court and the public have been stirred, the whole country is seething, the black current is wailing, and the green mountains have changed color. Looking remotely at the broken rivers and mountains of the Northeast, and the tragic and humiliating scene of the 30 million people, those with blood and vigor should not be muddleheaded, and those with national hatred and a sense of responsibility should not abandon their duty. Therefore, hundreds of thousands of Northeast Volunteer Army soldiers have risen up one after another, able to maintain their position against the powerful enemy for over a year with the spirit of courage and perseverance. Enduring hardship and difficulty, falling forward and following each other, only due to the lack of firearms and economic constraints, our respectable and lovable Northeast vanguard cannot fight in peace. The colleagues and others, seeing this, have organized the Northeast Volunteer Army Aid Team, not shirking any difficulties or pain, to fulfill the duty of every citizen and do our national duty. In the past few months, we have received enthusiastic assistance from all sectors and enthusiastic participation from comrades. The first batch went through customs on the day before last month to carry out aid work, and the second batch will also depart tonight (the 18th), all proficient in medicine and skilled in first aid, led by the team leader Fei Jian to Bengbu to gather at the Tongren Hospital. The third batch is being actively prepared and will rush north as soon as the organization is ready. The colleagues and others have limited talent and ability, and are sincerely afraid that the effect will not be great. We hope that our countrymen will remember this critical moment of survival, the wise will give their wisdom, and the brave will exert their strength, to encourage the courage of the volunteer army to engage in long-term confrontation, and to share the hardships with the volunteer army, providing first aid for wounds. Furthermore, the weather has been severely cold recently, and the volunteer army is still enduring hatred and hunger, thrusting straight forward in the icy and snowy fields. With broken bones and torn flesh, how can anyone not be moved? We sincerely hope that compatriots from all walks of life will rise up to assist, donating quilts and cotton clothing, providing a continuous supply of medicines and medical supplies, and especially generously donating money and enthusiastically transporting it, so that the soldiers in front can fight with peace of mind. We also hope that famous figures in the country will provide guidance so that the colleagues and others have a clear direction. This is our sincere hope.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Chinese Business Tram Workers Strike Yesterday Morning <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>▲Security Team and Workers</p>
<p>▲Both Sides Injured</p>
<p>▲Mayor Wu's Opinion</p>
<p>Yesterday, a labor dispute and bombing incident occurred at the Chinese Business Electric Company. The details of the incident and Mayor Wu's statement are described below.</p>
<p>▲Details of the Incident: Yesterday morning, a dispute arose at the Chinese Business Electric Company due to the loss of the tram car key. The factory and the workers immediately had a disagreement. The police station of the Second District Public Security Bureau, upon receiving the report, dispatched officers to investigate in order to maintain traffic. While investigating, the workers suddenly surrounded the office and demanded an immediate response to their demands for a pay raise from the general manager. The situation was extremely dangerous. The Public Security Bureau, upon hearing the news, immediately dispatched a police squadron to suppress the situation, but the workers were too numerous to be suppressed. The Security Department also dispatched the Tenth Squad of the Third Company of the First Regiment to assist at the scene, and the district chief of the Second District and the security squad leader and others gave gentle persuasion. At the same time, the Bureau of Social Affairs, together with the Public Security Bureau and the Municipal Party Department, dispatched personnel to discuss mediation measures. It was decided to telegram the factory's general manager, Lu Bohong, to go to the Bureau of Social Affairs for talks. Lu was ordered to go immediately, but was blocked by the workers, and some workers pushed a tramcar to the entrance of the factory, seemingly with a purpose. At that time, the security squad leader, Wu Liang, fearing that an incident would occur, personally stepped forward to stop them. While dispersing the crowd, there was a sudden boom, and Captain Wu's legs were injured. Two security soldiers, one police officer from the Second District, and ten workers were slightly injured in their feet, except for one person who was injured in the face. Captain Wu was not yet aware of his own injuries at the time and ordered the soldiers he brought to gather outside the factory to maintain order. The regiment headquarters, upon hearing the news, immediately dispatched two senior military officers to send Captain Wu and the injured soldiers to the regiment's medical treatment. In order to clarify responsibility, they immediately inspected the soldiers' guns at the scene, and there were no signs of gunfire. The bullets carried by each soldier, 26 in each row, were also complete and intact. Soon, the municipal government heard the news and sent personnel to the scene to investigate and sent the injured workers to Renji Hospital for treatment. According to the doctor's report, the injured had their wounds bandaged separately, and X-rays were taken to determine that the wounds were caused by small pieces scattered into the skin, which did not appear to be gunshot wounds and were not very serious. Except for one person who should be hospitalized for treatment, the rest had already returned on their own. After the Public Security Bureau's detailed investigation, it can be proven that this loud boom that injured more than ten people was definitely not caused by gunfire. Furthermore, according to the doctor's examination, the wounds were small pieces of metal, which seemed to be from a bomb. It is said that the Public Security Bureau is still continuing to investigate the source of this object and the person who used it.</p>
<p>Another report says that after the incident, the municipal government immediately ordered the Public Security Bureau and the Security Department to dispatch police teams to the city's water and electricity companies to provide effective protection, and ordered the Public Utilities Bureau to dispatch personnel to take care of the situation to ensure that the city's water and electricity supply would not be affected.</p>
<p>▲Mayor's Statement: Yesterday, after the bombing incident at the Chinese Business Electric Company, reporters rushed to the municipal government to inquire about Mayor Wu's attitude towards the case. He said that labor strikes at the factory have occurred for years, and although the Party and government agencies have repeatedly mediated and dealt with them, the strikes have risen and fallen from time to time, and have never been resolved. Today, the factory suddenly lost the tram car key, and the workers suddenly announced a strike, surrounding the company's manager, gathering crowds to coerce and refusing to be suppressed by the police, and throwing bombs to injure people while the security team leader was persuading them. It seems that this is not a simple labor dispute. There must be bad elements among the workers deliberately disrupting local order and social tranquility, and inciting unrest from within. In order to protect public safety and maintain the law, I have no choice but to thoroughly investigate and strictly pursue the matter in order to deter future offenders. Therefore, in addition to ordering the Public Utilities Bureau and the Public Security Bureau to find ways to effectively protect the factory's water and power generation, I have also ordered the Bureau of Social Affairs and the Public Security Bureau to work with the Party Department to severely investigate the situation that caused the disaster today.</p>
<p>However, according to another report, the Chinese Business Electric Company's workers demanded improvements to their treatment conditions. After the Municipal Party Department reviewed the matter, the Bureau of Social Affairs was working to mediate the situation. Yesterday, the workers in the vehicle department claimed that all the tram keys had been stolen, so the trams on all routes could not leave the factory. The Party and government agencies immediately dispatched personnel to investigate, temporarily dispatched police to strictly guard the area, and advised the workers to find a way to hand over the spare keys to the workers. However, the workers refused to work because the issue of pay raises had not been resolved, and went on strike. At 3:00 PM, the Bureau of Social Affairs convened a meeting to question them and again advised the union to no avail. At that time, the company's manager, Lu Bohong, was surrounded by workers in the factory. The security team, upon hearing the news, went to rescue him, but the workers prevented them from entering. At 3:30 PM, a hand grenade was suddenly thrown from the crowd, followed by the sound of gunfire, resulting in the injury of one security team platoon leader, three soldiers, and eleven workers. Qi Bingyuan, car driver No. 19, was injured in both feet and face; Chen Hongfan, ticket seller No. 15, was injured in his left leg; Zhu Shunquan, ticket seller No. 76, was injured in his left wrist; Qin Jiarong, ticket seller No. 7, was injured in his right leg; Hu Hengqing, car driver No. 22, was injured in his right foot; Wang Asi, engine room worker, was injured in his right leg, with a bullet entering his face and exiting through his mouth; Zhang Jiashu, ticket seller No. 57, was injured in his left leg; Li Fugen, car driver No. 23, was injured in his left leg; Wang Xiyuan, ticket seller No. 89, was injured in his left foot, face, and chest; and Hu Shuangfu, ticket seller No. 78, was injured in his left hand; Zhu Kaifa was injured in his left foot and right face. The injured workers were all transported to Renji Hospital by ambulance from the West District Fire Brigade. It is said that Wang Asi, the engine room worker who was seriously injured, may be in danger of death.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Bomb and Pistol Attack at Maotai Store <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>▲Two Youths Appear Suddenly</p>
<p>▲Warning Letter Sent a Month Ago</p>
<p>▲Customers Terrified</p>
<p>▲Wang Zhengtao Hit in the Waist</p>
<p>At 9:45 PM last night, while the Maotai Woolen Goods Store at 310 Xinzha Road was crowded with customers, two youths suddenly appeared outside. One was tall and the other short, both around twenty years old, wearing gray cloth robes. They each threw a bomb towards the glass counter at the entrance of the store. Upon seeing this, the customers were terrified and scrambled towards the street to escape. However, the bombs did not explode upon landing. The two youths then drew pistols and each fired a shot at the long glass counter beside the store. One bullet hit the lower glass pane of the counter, and the other struck Wang Zhengtao from Zhenjiang, the store's accountant, who was standing by the counter, in the left waist, causing him to immediately fall to the ground. Upon hearing the gunshots, nearby businesses were thrown into panic. The two youths then fled amidst the chaos. When the nearby patrol officers arrived, they found Wang unconscious and immediately reported to the police station. A large number of detectives were dispatched and first transported the injured Wang Zhengtao to Baolong Hospital for treatment. It is reported that the bullet is still in his abdomen and his life is still in danger. Afterwards, they inspected the scene and recovered a bullet head under the long glass counter, along with the two unexploded bombs, and took them to the police station for investigation. According to the store's staff, they had not received any letters or warnings prior to the incident, except for a warning letter received a month ago. They also said that the goods sold had been inspected.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Ministry of Communications Orders Recall of China Merchants' Steam Navigation Company Shares <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>▲Zhu Jia-hua Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<p>Minister of Communications Zhu Jia-hua arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing at 8:00 AM yesterday. In addition to attending the meeting on the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund, he also met with acting President Song Ziwen and the directors and supervisors of the China Merchants' Steam Navigation Company. It is heard that the Ministry of Communications is already discussing the method for recalling shares. Further news regarding the China Merchants' Steam Navigation Company is detailed below.</p>
<p>▲Ministry of Communications Order: When reporters interviewed Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Communications yesterday to inquire about the method of recalling shares, Minister Zhu replied that the government's intention is that if shareholders are willing to hand over their shares to the government at the fixed price of fifty taels, the government will pay in cash; otherwise, they will not be forced. As for the date of the share recall and the entrusted organization, the Ministry has issued an order to the board of directors of the China Merchants' Steam Navigation Company. The reporter also obtained a copy of the Ministry of Communications' order, which is transcribed below: "Order: Regarding the matter of the China Merchants' Steam Navigation Company being nationalized, the National Government has issued a clear order. All shares should be submitted within a fixed period, from December 1, 1932 to December 28, 1933, to the Central Bank, which is entrusted to verify the shares and pay fifty taels of silver per share according to regulations. The detailed measures should be drafted and submitted to the board of directors for approval. This order."</p>
<p>▲Liu Hongsheng Speaks: A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency interviewed Liu Hongsheng, the general manager of the China Merchants' Steam Navigation Company, yesterday. According to his answers to the reporter's questions: (1) Minister Zhu came to Shanghai today, but I have not yet met him, so the follow-up matters of the company have not been discussed. (2) The implementation date for the share recall still needs to be approved by the Ministry of Communications. However, the measures reported in Nanjing in today's (18th) newspaper are not a formal draft decision. As far as I know, when the shares are recalled in the future, in addition to being recalled at the assessed price of fifty taels, if the shareholders do not want to sell, they will not be forced to sell, and it is hoped that they can be shareholders with the government. (3) Except for a letter of protest from the China Business Corporation on the day the four wharves were taken back, there has been no second letter. The company has not yet responded because the case has not been completely resolved.</p>
<p>▲Payment of Back Pay: Due to economic reasons during Li Guojie's tenure, the salaries of the China Merchants' Steam Navigation Company employees have only been paid for half a month since September, and no payment was made at all in October. It is learned that the new General Manager Liu Hongsheng has already notified the accounting department that all back pay will be paid together with this month's salary starting from the end of this month.</p>
<p>▲Appointment of Secretaries: Since the reorganization of the bureau, the staff of each department has been fully announced. Yesterday, seven secretaries were officially appointed to the secretariat, namely Xu Zhiyi, Chen Yinfu, and Wu Dongqing as secretaries, and Wang Jianxun, Cai Lisheng, Jiang Shan, and Qi Fuming as assistant secretaries.</p>
<p>▲News from the Li Residence: Since Li Guojie was detained, his wife has been running around to find ways to rescue him, hoping that Li can regain his freedom as soon as possible. The afternoon before yesterday, Mrs. Li went to the China Merchants' Steam Navigation Company to see General Manager Liu Hongsheng and asked him to find a way. Liu said that this was a government order and told her to see Song Ziwen, the acting President of the Executive Yuan. Mrs. Li then changed her route to the Song residence, but the outcome is still unknown.</p>
<p>▲Impeachment Proposal: Supervisor Li Menggeng discussed that Li Guojie's unauthorized pledge of company assets and loss of shipping administration, if not signed by Chen Fumu, may not be legally effective. Chen and others are suspected of colluding in fraud. The Supervisory Yuan has completed the review of the impeachment memorial and evidence and has sealed it and sent it to the President for review, and then requested the National Government to order the Committee on Disciplinary Punishment of Public Officials to punish them according to law.</p>
<p>▲Contract Losses: Gao Tingzi, Director of the Shipping Administration Department of the Ministry of Communications, discussed that there are many points in the contract for the pledge of funds by the China Merchants' Steam Navigation Company that result in the loss of sovereignty. The most important are: (1) Although the contract is for a period of twenty years, the China Merchants' Steam Navigation Company has been losing money every year. How can such a huge amount of money be repaid? It is simply turning a small debtor into a large debtor and permanently forfeiting all assets to foreigners. Other losses such as the actual receipt of 85% and the amount of subsidiary funds are not worth mentioning. (2) According to the rights of the creditor, the mortgaged property can be re-mortgaged to a third party. If it is stipulated that in twenty years, if it is re-mortgaged for several years, even up to a hundred years, the debtor has no right to intervene. (3) In addition to the four wharves, there are also large areas of land among the mortgaged properties. The Shanghai market is developing rapidly. During this period, the company can build houses on the land. When we raise funds to recover the property in the future, if the company demands tens of millions of dollars for the cost of building on the land, how will we deal with it in the future? It will inevitably be permanently occupied by others.</p>

<p>▲Canton-Hankow Railway Loan Has Significant Progress</p>
<p>▲But Cannot Be Announced, Meeting Continues Today</p>
<p>After the first meeting of the Finance Committee of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund Committee was convened the day before yesterday, the second meeting was held at 1 Jiujiang Road at 4:00 PM yesterday.

The meeting lasted for more than two hours and ended at 6:30 PM. It is heard that the Canton-Hankow Railway loan issue was still being discussed and significant progress has been made, but Chief Director Hang Xuanwu stated that the content of the discussion cannot be announced at present because the results of the discussion need to be submitted to the general meeting for formal decision. The general meeting has been approved to be held in Nanjing on December 3. The third meeting will continue at around 4:00 PM this afternoon at the Banking Association on Hong Kong Road. It is hoped that the entire case will be concluded at today's meeting, otherwise one or two more meetings will be held next week to discuss it.</p>

<p>▲Supporting the Northeastern Volunteer Army</p>
<p>▲Opposing the Lytton Report</p>
<p>Emergency Notice from the Preparatory Committee for the Joint Association of All Shanghai Students Supporting the Northeastern Volunteer Army and Opposing the Lytton Investigation Team Report: "With a heavy heart, we note that since the September 18th Incident, a year and a half has passed, and half of our territory has fallen into enemy hands. The banks of the Huangpu River have also suffered an unprecedented disaster. The government authorities only pay lip service to long-term resistance and have never taken any practical countermeasures. Past events are not being investigated. Now, as the cold wind blows, our brave Northeastern Volunteer Army, fighting for national liberation, is engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy, but the government authorities turn a blind eye. Now, the Lytton Investigation Team's report has been published to the world, and its content is clearly a declaration to divide China, which has long been understood by the people of the country. Although the report is of a recommendatory nature, the League of Nations will soon meet to pass it, and the report will soon become a reality. A great country will be at the mercy of others. In this critical situation, it is difficult to sit idly by and watch it fall. Therefore, the Preparatory Committee for the Joint Association of Shanghai Students Supporting the Northeastern Volunteer Army and Opposing the Lytton Report has been organized. All preparations have been completed, and an expanded preparatory meeting is specially convened, hoping that all large and small middle school groups and cultural groups in Shanghai will send representatives to participate in jointly planning the proceedings. We also invite honorary members of this association, Ms. Soong Ching-ling, Hu Yuzhi, Wu Mai, and Chen Binhe, and other gentlemen to attend and give speeches. Meeting location: Dataxia University on Zhongshan Road, November 20th at 9:00 AM. Preparatory Committee for the Joint Association of All Shanghai Students Supporting the Northeastern Volunteer Army and Opposing the Lytton Investigation Team Report."</p>

<p>to assign, transfer, or sublet the Leased Wharves to a third party, but the term shall not exceed the final expiry date stipulated in Article 1 of this lease. It may also sublet land not needed for the wharf business to a third party to establish a building construction agreement, the term of which shall also not exceed the final expiry date stipulated in this lease. In the event that the Lessee does not wish to comply with the provisions for continuation of this agreement on the expiry date of the twenty-year term, the Lessor shall accept the land lease and building construction agreement concluded by the Lessee with a third party which has not yet expired, and acknowledge all provisions of the agreement, continuing to comply with them until the expiry date of the agreement. 9.

All buildings, wharves, pontoons, and other structures adjacent to the east of the China Wharf, which were previously leased by the Ocean Shipping Wharf Company, are also within this property, as the location of the former Ocean Shipping Wharf Company was actually the eastern part of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company China Wharf property. Both parties further acknowledge and agree that the easternmost real estate and wharf warehouses, etc., of the above-mentioned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company China Wharf are also included in this lease.

Both parties agree that in the event that any part of the Leased Wharves is destroyed or damaged by storms, heavy rain, earthquakes, internal or external wars, and unavoidable natural disasters or man-made calamities, rendering the buildings unusable for the wharf business, the Lessee may, under such circumstances, suspend payment of the rent for the duration of the damage and during the reconstruction of the buildings. 13. The Lessee may have the riverbanks of the unrated Central and Northern Wharves rated according to the regulations of the Lingpu Engineering Bureau. The expenses required for the rating shall be separately recorded in the Lessor's arrears account. If the arrears are not repaid on time, the Lessee shall calculate interest at the usual annual rate of nine percent. Whenever the Lessor has funds to repay, the arrears shall be immediately deducted. 14. Both parties mutually acknowledge that from the date of signing the contract, any problems, disputes, or disagreements, and however they may arise, shall be immediately referred to two impartial persons. One impartial person shall be selected by the Lessor, and one shall be selected by the Lessee. If the two impartial persons cannot agree, the two impartial persons may jointly elect a chief impartial person. All must be judged in accordance with current American law. The result of the judgment, whether determined by the two impartial persons or by the chief impartial person, shall be acknowledged, obeyed, and willing to be implemented by both parties. If one party has notified the other party of the impartial person it has appointed, and the other party fails to appoint or refuses to appoint its due impartial person within ten days, then whatever the problem, dispute, or disagreement, the party that has already selected an impartial person may immediately submit it to the impartial person of that party for exclusive judgment. Both parties further acknowledge and agree that in all the above-mentioned circumstances, the result of the judgment of the impartial person appointed by that party shall be fully obeyed by that party and the other party, and the impartial person of that party shall be regarded as if appointed by agreement of both parties. 15.

Both parties agree that Party A shall pay Party B interest on this mortgage loan at an annual rate of 9%, calculated on the face value of the issued bonds. Each bond shall accrue interest from the date of sale. The interest payment period shall be every three months. Interest not paid when due shall also accrue compound interest at the usual annual rate of 9%. 4. Both parties mutually acknowledge and agree that the amount of discount and the amount of interest, whether profit or loss, between this mortgage loan and the sale and issuance of bonds are the responsibility of Party B and have nothing to do with Party A. 5.

The annual rent is set at 300,000 taels, payable in four installments per year, with each installment covering three months. The terms and provisions of the lease of the three wharves shall be stipulated in a separate contract. 7. In order to prepare for the payment of the interest on this mortgage loan and to annually raise funds to be deposited into the sinking fund account for the repayment of the bond loan, Party A designates the following income for the above-mentioned purposes: (A) The annual rent of the Central, Northern, and China Wharves leased to Party B; (B) The rent receivable for the various properties listed in Section 2, Item E, of Article 1 of this contract (It is noted that this rent cannot be collected at present and will have to wait until the end of this year, when Party A cancels the mortgage loan contract and the land lease building contract, etc., signed between the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the 久昌 Company, before it can be implemented); (C) 25% of the net profit of Party A in the shipping business shall be allocated each year; (D) Party B shall collect the wharf fees and warehouse rents, etc., that Party A should have on Jinliyuan and Yangjiadu on schedule. All additional expenses incurred by Party B in collecting these wharf fees and warehouse rents, etc., from Party A shall be borne by Party A. If practically needed, Party B may hire wharf and warehouse managers on its own, and the monthly salaries of these employees shall be borne by Party A. 8. All income under the above items shall be collected by Party B in its capacity. This income shall first be used to pay off the interest on this mortgage loan stipulated in this contract. If the rental income and all payments received are insufficient to pay off the interest on this mortgage loan stipulated in this contract, the interest that should have been paid but was not shall be recorded separately in Party A's arrears account as outstanding interest. The outstanding interest shall also accrue compound interest at the usual annual rate of 9%. If there is a surplus from the above-mentioned income items or if there are funds available from other sources, it shall be immediately credited to Party A's sinking fund account for repayment of the bonds to prepare for the payment of the principal of this mortgage loan sold and issued under this contract, and the interest due on this mortgage loan until the due date. Party B shall do its best to ensure that the funds in this income sinking fund account can be used to generate the maximum possible interest. The maximum interest earned must also be credited to the sinking fund account for repayment of the bond loan. The amount already credited to Party A's sinking fund account for repayment of the bond loan shall be managed entirely by Party B, but if Party A has a good plan to enable this sinking fund to generate a higher rate of interest, it may make a suggestion to Party B. 9. Party A acknowledges that during the term of this contract, it shall pay Party B a handling fee of 5% based on the amount of the above-mentioned income collected by Party B on its behalf, excluding the annual rent of the three wharves. All management and other services for the various houses or warehouses stated in Section 2, Item E, of Article 1 of this contract shall be borne by Party B. 10. Party A acknowledges that it shall pay Party B a commission of 2.5% calculated on the face value of the bonds issued under this contract. This commission shall be paid on the date of sale of each bond. 11. Party B agrees to completely separate the various receipts and payments accounts under this contract from Party B's own business accounts. 12. Party A acknowledges and agrees that none of the wharves, warehouses, and other real estate listed in this contract shall be mortgaged again, and guarantees to be responsible for handling all negotiations to eliminate any legal interference. If there have been negotiations for a second secured loan using the property as collateral, Party A shall be responsible for handling the matter clearly and shall not involve Party B. 13. Both parties understand and agree that in the event that Party A wishes to sell all or part of the above-mentioned properties during the term of this contract before this mortgage loan has been repaid, Party B shall have the right of first refusal to purchase all or part of the properties. Both parties agree that whether the sale is handled by Party A or by Party B, Party B shall be paid a normal commission of 2.5%. 14. In the event that Party A fails to repay the principal due on the date of maturity of this mortgage loan represented by the face value of the issued bonds and the interest payable on this mortgage loan according to the face value of the bonds, or the funds in Party A's sinking fund account for repayment of the bond loan are insufficient to repay all or part of the principal due on the date of maturity of the above-mentioned mortgage loan represented by the face value of the issued bonds and the interest payable on this mortgage loan according to the face value of the bonds, Party B shall have full power to dispose of or sell all or part of the properties listed in this contract by public auction or private negotiation to repay the principal and interest due. If it is still insufficient, Party A shall compensate by other means. If there is a surplus, Party B shall pay it to Party A after repaying the principal and interest due. 15. Party B acknowledges that once the principal, other payments, and commissions, etc., for the bonds issued under this contract have been fully repaid, all the real estate listed in this contract shall be re-transferred to Party A by Party B. 16. Both parties mutually acknowledge that from the date of signing this contract, any problems, disputes, or disagreements, and however they may arise, shall be immediately referred to two impartial persons. One impartial person shall be selected by Party A, and one shall be selected by Party B. If the two impartial persons cannot agree, the two impartial persons may jointly elect a chief impartial person. All must be judged in accordance with current American law. The result of the judgment, whether determined by the two impartial persons or by the chief impartial person, shall be acknowledged, obeyed, and willing to be implemented by both parties. If one party has notified the other party of the impartial person it has appointed, and the other party fails to appoint or refuses to appoint its due impartial person within ten days, then whatever the problem, dispute, or disagreement, the party that has already selected an impartial person may immediately submit it to the impartial person of that party for exclusive judgment. Both parties further acknowledge and agree that in all the above-mentioned circumstances, the result of the judgment of the impartial person appointed by that party shall be fully obeyed by that party and the other party, and the impartial person of that party shall be regarded as if appointed by agreement of both parties. 17.

<p>▲ National Coal Association Dispatches Personnel to Investigate</p>
<p>▲ Major Factories Can Adopt as Much as Possible</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese National Coal Production and Sales Joint Association was originally a national coal production and sales joint agency. After the outbreak of the September 18th Incident, the association, in response to the trend of the times, requested Executive Committee member Yu Shunqing to leave Shanghai and go to coal-producing areas in Shanxi, Shandong, Hebei, and other provinces to conduct on-site investigations. The trip took several months. Recently, he negotiated with the Hebei Jingxing Mining Bureau to promote the sale of coal produced by the mine to South China and abroad. According to Mr. Yu, the Jingxing coal is of pure quality and has sufficient heating power. Seven tons of this coal can be equivalent to ten tons of Fushun coal. After Mr. Yu returned to Shanghai, he is currently in contact with various parties. Major factories in the city can adopt as much as possible.</p>

<p>After the troops of Liu Zhennian were reassigned to eastern Zhejiang, the Shaoxing Native Association held an emergency meeting yesterday to discuss ways to prevent Liu's troops from coming to Zhejiang. It was decided to send telegrams to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Chairman of the Military Council, the Minister of Military and Political Affairs, and the Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, requesting them to observe public opinion and carefully consider alternative plans.

<h3 id="e165">A Strong Effort to Oppose Telephone Rate Hikes, Documents and Telegrams <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>▲ The Shanghai Municipal District Association and the Nanjing Road Business Community Association, in order to oppose telephone rate increases, sent a telegram to various ministries and institutes in the capital, Nanjing, addressed to the National Government of Nanjing, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Industry: This time, the Shanghai Telephone Company first obtained approval from the Engineering Bureau of the First Special District, and then the consent of the Board of Directors of the Second Special District, to increase residential telephone fees from 52 taels of silver to 65 taels, and business fees from 78 taels of silver to 105 taels, and to increase the charge per call from 5 fen (small coin) to 4 fen of silver, and to retroactively apply this from March 27th of this year. While we recognize that, in reality, the telephone company may inevitably obtain the approval of the authorities within the district through coercive and intimidating means such as disconnecting lines, and while we may not be able to achieve the goal of canceling the rate increase and its retroactive application, we will not abandon our interests, so that this unjust and barbaric method may be subjected to the judgment of world opinion. Telephones are a public utility. On the one hand, they obtain a patent; on the other hand, due to low usage fees, the business, because of the patent, consolidates its capital interests. It should therefore be lower than the general business. Checking this year's discount rate of the US Federal Reserve Bank is 2.5%, the Bank of England in the UK is 2%, and the interest rate on Chinese government bonds is 6%. The interest rates on the corporate bonds of the Shanghai Electric Power Company and the Shanghai Telephone Company are both 6%. We do not know for what reason the municipal authorities within the district approved the Shanghai Telephone Company's revenue to be 8%, plus another 2%, totaling 10%, thus increasing the burden on users. The Engineering Bureau, which first approved this method, has already failed in its responsibility to those it represents. Even if we concede that the current telephone fee increase is constrained by the contract signed between the Engineering Bureau and the Shanghai Telephone Company on August 5, 1930, the price increase must be in accordance with the report of Mr. An Mei. The contract does not stipulate that its basis can be the unreasonable 10% interest. Investigating the capital invested by the Shanghai Telephone Company and the total number of telephone lines and equipment it has prepared, there are tens of thousands of households, of which tens of thousands have been used. Assuming the latter is 30,000 households and the former is 100,000 households, then the capital used for the 70,000 unused telephone lines and equipment is due to the company's miscalculation and self-inflicted stagnation, which has nothing to do with the users. Why must the Engineering Bureau force the users to bear the interest on the capital that has been left idle due to the company's miscalculation? The most unfair thing this time is that the obligations of the telephone company under the contract are exempted and fulfilled as much as possible, and the rights are protected as much as possible, while the economic decline suffered by the taxpayers it represents after the Japanese disturbance in Shanghai is ignored. It is unwilling to exempt them from their forced obligations and protect their right to low usage fees. This is the dereliction of duty of the Director-General of the Engineering Bureau. The October 21st issue of the Engineering Bureau Gazette published a letter from Mr. Anson to Mr. Jones, the Director-General of the Public Concession, regarding his opinion on telephone rate increases. From the meaning of the third paragraph of Mr. Anson's letter, Mr. An has already realized that it is difficult to escape the judgment of public opinion, and admits that this opinion does not take into account the changes in the economic situation during this period. It also says that if he were to be asked to come to China again to investigate, he would definitely have another report. This is sufficient to show that Mr. An's previous report admitted that he could not take into account the interests of the majority of the public at present, which led to disputes. The Engineering Bureau should also eliminate its prejudices, be responsible for negotiating with the company to cancel the compensation for the new price, set a fair price, and obtain the consent of the users to implement it on a regular basis to eliminate disputes and achieve a peaceful solution. We earnestly request your department to immediately lodge a serious protest with the diplomatic missions to strive for a fair solution that takes into account the interests of both parties. We cannot express our prayers enough. The Shanghai Municipal District Association and the Nanjing Road Business Community Association respectfully request.</p>
<p>▲ The Nanjing Road Business Community Association and the First District Branch of the Citizens' Association, in order to strongly oppose the telephone rate increase, yesterday again submitted a document to the Municipal Government, stating: The Shanghai Telephone Company rashly stopped telephone service, and negotiations are becoming increasingly tense. Please quickly correct this to reduce the burden on the citizens and find ways to stop illegal actions and stabilize business affairs. The association previously reported that the Shanghai Telephone Company illegally increased rates and requested your government to quickly negotiate with the Engineering Bureau and telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to request a serious protest to the diplomatic missions. Later, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a telegram stating: "Your telegram has been received. If the Shanghai Concession's telephone rate increase is as stated in your telegram, then the company's measures are indeed inappropriate and should be corrected to reduce the burden on the citizens. The Shanghai Municipal Government has been instructed to investigate and handle the matter. A special reply from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been printed and distributed." However, the company still adheres to its fixed opinion on the rate increase and refuses to yield. It even intensifies its coercion by disconnecting lines and doing whatever it wants to achieve its goals. Moreover, it was reported that on November 13, more than 500 users were disconnected. All users in the city are indignant, and the incident is expanding and becoming increasingly tense. We sincerely fear that delays and a failure to stop this will not only increase the accidental losses of the citizens, but also lead to an unsustainable state of social unrest. The future is worrying. Therefore, we submit another document requesting your government to examine and approve it, quickly investigate and handle it in accordance with the deleted telegram, and stop the company's illegal actions for the public convenience.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Various Organizations Petition for Rent Reduction <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>▲ Document Addressed to Party and Government Organs</p>
<p>▲ The Hongkou Various Organizations Citizens' Association, the Hongkou Various District Branches, and the Yuanyang Road, Dongyouheng Road, Hanbury Road, East and West Huade Road, Broadway Road, Haining Road, North Jiangxi Road, Suzhou Road, North Shanxi Road, Jiaxing Road, Wuzhou Road, Zhoujiazui Road, Yuezhou Road, Tongzhou Road, Airange Road, Kenenghai Road, Yinxian Road, Yangshupu Road, and other Business Community Associations and other organizations yesterday specially convened a joint representative meeting. After the meeting, a document was submitted to the Municipal Government, stating: In order to reduce and exempt rent and relieve people's livelihood, we respectfully request your review and arbitration. The member stores at the end of North Jiangxi Road, such as Xinkai Road, Member Stores, Zida Changdahong Building, and other 50 households, jointly stated that Fanzhi was promoted to Rong Sheng Gengfu Sanli, which is the property of Xielong Real Estate Company. The houses were newly built and completed not long ago, and the road in that area was opened last year and has not yet been completed, resulting in a lack of pedestrian traffic in the market there. Moreover, the area was particularly dangerous during the January 28th Incident. The state after the war is comparable to the horror during the war. In such a harsh environment, the market is declining, and it is conceivable that the citizens who want to live there did not move in until September. Even today, the houses are empty and sparsely populated, extremely desolate, and the rent is high, and the small rents are as high as three months, which is an evil example of opening a rental house that violates the decrees of our government. Now, all the tenants are united in demanding a 30% rent reduction, the return of small rents, and the relief of the market. The rent price of a landlord renting out a house should be based on the situation, and it should not only seek profit and increase the burden on ordinary small businesses. The market in that area is declining, and the smoke and fire are sparse, which is indeed vastly different from other prosperous places. Rent reduction is a fair demand of the citizens to maintain people's livelihood and show compassion for business difficulties. It is reasonable to submit a document requesting a review and prompt arbitration to avoid disputes for the public convenience.</p>
<p>▲ Citizens' Association The Citizens' Association yesterday submitted a document to the Municipal Party Headquarters for the rent reduction movement, stating: Respectfully submitted, according to the letters from the 20 district branches of our association, since the rent reduction movement in our city has been going on for a long time, a satisfactory solution has not been seen. Although the Municipal Party Headquarters, etc., previously submitted a request to the National Government to send personnel to Shanghai to consider the situation and revise the rent exemption standards, several months have passed and it has not been implemented. Since the January 28th Incident occurred in our city, our industrial and commercial sectors have been completely destroyed, and the damage suffered is incalculable. Although the Municipal Government has announced rent exemption standards for areas such as Zhabei and Nanshi, the central area south of the Suzhou River has been ignored and no mention has been made of it. The bead is in arrears and the balance is not restored. Although the merchants in our central district were not directly ravaged by the violent bandits, the two-month strike and the stagnation of commerce have caused great losses in operating expenses, which cannot be overstated. Moreover, the central district is commercially prosperous and densely populated, and the demand for rent is greater than the supply, so the rent price is increasing day by day. Furthermore, the operation of wealthy merchants is monopolized, which makes the land price rise day by day and the rent more expensive. The rent alone accounts for more than half of the expenses of a store. Can it be said that the current demand for reduction and exemption is excessive? However, if this continues without a resolution, disputes will arise repeatedly, which is ultimately not a good strategy. In recent days, our association has been criticized and urged by members to resolve the issue, making it difficult for us to remain silent. Correspondingly, we have recorded the case and forwarded it to you, hoping that you will examine it, handle it, and avoid disputes while maintaining commerce, and give us a reply so that we can follow it. This is our prayer, and it is truly convenient for the Party to resolve the suffering of the tenants as soon as possible.</p>

<p>▲ Travel Expenses Issued by Creditors for Dismissal</p>
<p>Since the January 28th Incident, Tianbao Road Bao Da Silk Weaving Factory immediately announced the closure and liquidation of all workers. After the order was restored, it presented a request to the Party and government agencies for relief because the factory owner refused to meet and could not proceed. The labor union issued a warning to the factory owner in the newspaper. Recently, the factory leased out and started work, refusing to hire old workers. The Social Affairs Bureau specially convened the creditors of the Da Silk Factory, the representative of Liugongji, Lian Shoushan, and the factory owner of Dachangde, Cheng Wuting, yesterday, along with the seventh district silk weaving labor union Zheng Lili and Qing Han, to mediate. The mediation was recorded by the mediators Zhu Guilin and Wang Zuofang, and the two sides agreed to resolve the issue. After the Bao Da Silk Factory closed down, travel expenses totaling $180 were issued by the creditors of Liugongji to dismiss the workers.</p>

<p>▲ Working in Shifts at Specified Times</p>
<p>After the Tian Lun Silk Weaving Factory in Mingyuanfang, Huade Road, stopped the night shift the day before yesterday, the day and night shift workers competed for work, resulting in a conflict. The factory immediately announced a shutdown. The Social Affairs Bureau convened both labor and management at 10:00 AM yesterday for mediation. Fang Dehua of the Tian Lun Silk Weaving Factory and Wei Shouchang and Shao Hongqin of the fourth district silk weaving labor union were present. The meeting was chaired by Tan Peiyan of the Social Affairs Bureau. First, the labor and management representatives stated the process, and then they discussed and agreed to sign a reconciliation record: (1) The factory stipulates that work is for 16 hours in two shifts; (2) The wages remain the same at 3.6%; (3) Those who resume work for more than three days will be given a food allowance of $0.20 per person per day by the factory (this allowance will be stopped when the day and night shifts are resumed). As a result, all the workers entered the factory at the same time in the afternoon to work in shifts as usual.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Workers of Da China Welfare Rubber Shoe Factory Went on Strike Yesterday Morning <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>▲ Demanding Improved Treatment and Opposing the Dismissal of Representatives</p>
<p>▲ Party and Government Agencies Sent Personnel to Investigate Thoroughly and Find Ways to Mediate</p>
<p>The entire workforce of the Da China Welfare Rubber Shoe Factory in Xingjiazai Road, Zhabei, demanded improved treatment and opposed the factory's dismissal of worker representatives Zhu Caixing and others. They went on strike starting yesterday morning and went to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau to petition. At 3:00 PM, party and government agencies sent personnel to investigate thoroughly.</p>
<p>▲ Yesterday morning's strike. The factory was affected by the January 28th Incident and slightly reduced workers' wages to maintain the status quo when it resumed operations on April 1st of this year. On the 5th of this month, all workers demanded a restoration, which led to a strike. After the Wang Patrol Officer of the First Branch of the Fifth District persuaded them, they resumed work. The day before yesterday, factory director Yang Yongnian announced the dismissal of workers Zhu Caixing, Cai Geng, Li Rongchang, Qian Maotou, and other four people who had been absent from work without permission for more than three days, which aroused the workers' anger and led to a strike yesterday morning.</p>
<p>▲ Workers petition. After the factory's more than 400 male and female workers went on strike, they sent representatives from various departments to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition. The director of the Mediation Section, Wang Guangqing, met with them and ordered them to resume work immediately and wait for mediation. The Municipal Party Headquarters was met by Zhao Zhenhui of the Civil Training Section, who promised to work with the Social Affairs Bureau to find a way to mediate. At the same time, the First Branch of the Fifth District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau sent police officers to be stationed near the factory to prevent any disturbances.</p>
<p>▲ Party and government investigation. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau sent Tan Peiyan to investigate the truth at 3:00 PM yesterday in order to verify and handle the matter.</p>

<h3 id="e173">Municipal Government to Host Visit to the City Center Today <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>▲ The Municipal Government Building Imitates the Ancient Palace Style</p>
<p>▲ Expected to be Completed by May or June Next Year</p>
<p>Construction of the city center area of the Greater Shanghai Plan has been underway for a long time. Construction of the Municipal Government Building and road projects in the area are currently being accelerated. It is expected that all projects will be completed by the end of June next year, and the Municipal Government will move to the area to work to promote the revitalization of the area. As for the first and second land acquisitions in the area, the first was delayed due to the impact of the Shanghai War. Now that the construction in the area has returned to its original state, those who pay the acquisition fee are very enthusiastic. In order to make all sectors understand, the Municipal Government has set up an invitation to visit this afternoon. The following is an exploration of the construction projects and the land acquisition fee collection by the Land Bureau.</p>
<p>▲ Road Engineering The roads in the city center area, such as Sanmin Road and Wuquan Road, have long been completed. The remaining roads have been delayed due to the impact of the Shanghai War. Now, because the Municipal Government Building is scheduled to be completed by the end of May next year, the road construction is being rushed. The road surfaces have been opened and leveled. The second step of the project is paving the road surface, which is also being actively carried out.</p>
<p>▲ Municipal Government Building The Municipal Government Building is located in the center of the city center area. The project started on June 1 last year, and the foundation stone laying ceremony was held on July 7. The entire project was contracted by Zhu Senji for a total of 550,000 yuan. It was originally scheduled to be completed by the end of this year. After the start of construction, the work was very smooth. However, the Shanghai War broke out in January of this year, and the project was suspended. The project was resumed on July 1 of this year, with a total suspension of five months, which resulted in the failure to complete the entire project on time. The contractor negotiated with the Municipal Government and agreed to extend the deadline to May of the following year. According to the construction foreman, the work is now very tight, with about 400 workers. Therefore, it will be completed by the end of June at the latest. The one-month delay is actually due to the large scale of the project and unforeseen circumstances. As for the losses suffered during the five-month suspension, the amount is small, about eight or nine thousand yuan. The Municipal Government did not recognize it and could not be compensated for it, so it can only be recognized as a loss.</p>
<p>▲ Current Status of the Project The construction of the Municipal Government Building is purely imitative of the palace style of our country, with a height of four floors. The large auditorium is on the second floor, high and spacious, and can accommodate hundreds of people. In front is a platform connected by stone steps, which can be used to go up and down. The cement walls, floors, and stone steps of the entire building are roughly in place. Water pipes and water heating pipes have also been installed. The work to be done in the future will be whitewashing, painting, and laying marble floors. The roof is currently using water along the bottom and will be paved with green glazed tiles produced in Guangdong in the future. The roof ridge will be decorated with roof ornaments. The interior will be painted with colored lacquer. In the future, after completion, the building with carved beams will be extremely beautiful.</p>
<p>▲ Distribution of Rooms The allocation of the Municipal Government offices was decided when the Municipal Government drew up the plans. The center of the ground floor is the entrance hall with two stone stairs and two elevators on the left and right. The east room is the dining room, the west room is the printing office and the first department office. Another room behind the entrance hall is for storage. The walls are made of cement and are specially thickened. The center of the second floor is the auditorium, the east is the conference room, and the west is the library. The east of the third floor is the office of the fourth and fifth departments, the west is the office of the second and third departments, and the middle facing south is the mayor's office, and the north is the reception room, with a corridor in the middle. The roof of the middle room on the fourth floor is higher for the dormitory, and the two sides are lower for use as a vault and storage room. The roof beams are fully exposed to allow air circulation.</p>
<p>▲ Building for each Bureau After the completion of the Municipal Government Building, it must be moved to, and the subordinate bureaus will also be gathered in one place to avoid the labor of going back and forth. However, the municipal treasury is insufficient, and the building expenses for each bureau are not easy to raise for a while. Therefore, it is decided to build temporary offices for the time being. Bids will be solicited for construction within two weeks, and construction will begin on the same day to complete the Municipal Government Building at the same time.</p>
<p>▲ Urgent Payment of Acquisition Fees The land acquisition fees in the city center area have been repeatedly urged by the Municipal Government. The first and second land acquisition fees total about 2 million yuan, which are paid in two installments. The first installment of about 1.5 million yuan is scheduled to be paid by the end of this year, and the second installment of about 500,000 yuan is due by the end of February next year. According to reporters' investigation at the Land Bureau yesterday, those who paid the fee in recent days were quite enthusiastic and have already obtained more than half of the amount.</p>
<p>▲ Municipal Government Reception In order to make all sectors understand the recent situation of the construction in the area, the Municipal Government specially invited all sectors to visit this afternoon and ordered the Public Works Bureau to prepare vehicles for the public to ride in.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Illegal Closure of the Moye Daily in Taicang <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>▲ The District Court Opened a Collegial Panel Yesterday</p>
<p>▲ Zhu Tieying Elaborated on the Process</p>
<p>▲ The Magistrate of Taicang County Will Be Summoned for Interrogation</p>
<p>The editor of the Moye Daily in Taicang, Zhu Tieying, offended the director of the Bureau of Business Tax, Hu Jiacong, because of business tax matters. The magistrate of Taicang County, Zhao Enju, sentenced him to one year of imprisonment, a fine of 200 yuan, and the closure of the newspaper. Zhu believed that this judgment not only confused the legal system, but also only transmitted the order to the government by hand, without adding a public trial to determine the sentence. Moreover, what was stated was all the truth, which was considered illegal. Therefore, he filed an appeal to the Shanghai District Court. After being tried, the presiding judge Qian Chengjun, along with judges Shen Youqi and Guan Liting, opened a collegial panel in the first court at 11:00 AM yesterday to first hear the appellant for refusing to accept the one-year imprisonment and a fine of 200 yuan. He asked when the Moye Daily was established. The reply was September 1928. He asked when the Business Tax Bureau was established in Taicang. The reply was 1930. He asked whether the Business Tax Bureau was under the jurisdiction of the provincial government. The reply was yes. He asked who the director was. The reply was Hu Jiacong. He asked who the author of the manuscript published on newspaper No. 157 was. The reply was the reporter Shuang Fengqing, whose name was Shuang Feng. He asked whether the collection of southern goods stores and rice shops mentioned in the newspaper was in Shuangfeng. The reply was yes. Shuangfeng is under the jurisdiction of the Eighth District. He asked whether the area was a war zone. The reply was no. He asked whether the Tax Bureau went to the area to collect money. The reply was yes. Although the area was not a war zone, it was greatly affected. He asked why the report was published if it was not a war zone. The reply was that at the provincial government meeting on August 9, Shu Shifu, the director of the Department of Finance, proposed that those in the direct war zone be exempt from the business tax for the whole year and the autumn and winter seasons of the previous year, and those who were affected be exempt from the spring and summer seasons of this year. He asked when the report was published. The reply was the newspaper of August 19. He asked when they collected the tax. It was not published in the newspaper. The reply was before August 19. How did they ask for correction but did not correct it? The reply was that because it was a fact, it was not necessary to correct it according to the publication law. However, it was of course close to stealing a chicken to collect it again after the exemption. At this point, Zhang Jingcheng, a resident of Wuxing, testified as the director of the Jiading Office of the Taicang Business Tax Bureau. The head office was in Taicang. He asked whether the bureau had received an order from the provincial government exempting the business tax when collecting it before. The reply was no, until August 25, when it was received and submitted. He asked when the Department of Finance issued the document. The reply was unknown. He asked who went to Shuangfeng Town to collect the tax. The reply was Zhu Jinjiang and Hu Derong. He asked when it was. The reply was August 15. He asked what season the tax collected in Shuangfeng Town was for. The reply was spring. He asked whether there were any inappropriate places in the tax collection office. The reply was that there must be some discrepancies. He asked why Zhu Tieying was charged. The reply was that he destroyed our reputation, and we did not do anything close to stealing chickens. We reported to the Department of Finance in advance on the day of collection. He asked whether the spring tax was returned later. The reply was that it was returned in the autumn, from September 1 to 30. At this point, the lawyer declared that Zhao Enju, as the supervisor, had a great relationship with the business tax and should be summoned for questioning. At this point, the judge said that there were still many witnesses to be summoned for continued interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Li Chuanting, Comprador of Dingsheng, Escapes Danger <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>▲ Fire Consumes Bandit Lair, People Plead for Mercy</p>
<p>▲ Bandit Leader Surrenders, Discarding Twin Pistols</p>
<p>▲ Li Chuanting Falls Ill in Bandit Lair</p>
<p>▲ Many Hostages Rescued Simultaneously</p>
<p>Li Chuanting, comprador of the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Beiyang steamer "Dingsheng," was kidnapped by bandits in Tanggu for more than two months before finally being rescued recently. The matter was quite convoluted and truly worthy of record. The circumstances are investigated and noted as follows:</p>
<p>▲ North China Bandits Li Chuanting Kidnapped After Li Chuanting was kidnapped by bandits, the British Consul in Tianjin repeatedly requested the Tianjin authorities to rescue him, but there was no progress at first. Later, after purchasing information and investigating, it was discovered that Li was kidnapped by a major bandit group in North China and hidden in a fortress in Xin Village, more than forty miles from Tanggu. The area was the bandit lair, surrounded by fortifications that were difficult to attack. The bandit leader, named Liu Santaishi, was a young man with many followers and a large force. The surrounding villages were all under the control of the bandit. After Li was kidnapped, the government troops pursued him very closely, and he was unable to contact the hostage's family.</p>
<p>▲ Dispatching Troops to Suppress After the authorities obtained information, they immediately dispatched a regiment of troops to the bandit lair to suppress them. Unexpectedly, the bandit crowd came out to resist, and the bandit leader Liu Santaishi was able to fire guns with both hands, hitting the target every time. The government troops' attack failed to break through. Finally, they used the method of setting fire to burn down the bandit lair. This matter happened within the past week. The fire burned for many days, and the villages around the bandit lair were completely destroyed. The villagers in the same village suffered this disaster and knelt down to plead with the bandit leader.</p>
<p>▲ Bandit Leader Surrenders The villagers of the village went to Liu Santaishi to kneel and plead, saying that the entire fortress had been burned, which would cause too much damage. As a result, innocent people were implicated and too many were killed or injured, and they still could not escape. They requested that he not resist the government troops. The bandit leader, yielding to the request of the people, threw down his twin pistols and surrendered to the army, willing to be brought to justice and punished. Liu Santaishi was then captured. The army put out the fire and entered the village, arresting the bandit leader's brother and escorting them to Tianjin.</p>
<p>▲ Hostages Rescued A total of more than forty hostages were rescued from the bandit lair, including Li Chuanting. Most of the hostages were wealthy merchants and gentry. Li had become ill and was taken to Tianjin by the army. Upon receiving a telegram from Tianjin informing them that Li had been rescued by the government troops, his wife took a boat to Tianjin yesterday to welcome Li back to Shanghai for medical treatment in the hospital. They also reported the case to the British Consul, stating that the case had been solved. As for the bandit leader Liu Santaishi, according to the telegram, he was executed after arriving in Tianjin the day before yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Half a Card as Proof of Ransom <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>▲ Mistaking Detective for Client</p>
<p>▲ Tian Xinsong Highly Suspicious</p>
<p>Wang Youshan, a Chinese detective of the Shanghai Municipal Council Detective Branch, was walking near the intersection of Nanjing Road and Tibet Road at about 8:00 AM the day before yesterday when a man wearing a green cotton robe and a black vest stepped forward and asked Wang if his name was Li Jinshan. Wang, thinking that he came abruptly, casually replied that he was and asked the man what was the matter. The man immediately showed half a card printed with the name of Li Jinshan, saying that he had come to negotiate the ransom. Wang suspected his behavior and took him to the detective office for interrogation. According to the man's initial statement, his name was Tang Zhaonian, but then he suddenly said his name was Tian Xinsong, from Suzhou. He had opened a tailor shop at No. 5 Songbai Lane, Qiujiang Road, Zhabei. A few days ago, he returned to his village for some business and met a relative, Li Fengshan, who told him that his two sons, Li Qiaogen and Li Qiaosheng, were suddenly kidnapped by bandits in Linjia Lane, Yangcheng River on the tenth of last month. Later, he sent a letter demanding a ransom, with half a card as proof of the ransom negotiation, and asked someone to go to Room 12, Pingqiao Hotel, Avenue Edward VII, Shanghai to negotiate. Because my family lives in Shanghai, Li gave me the card and asked me to inquire at any time whether there was such a person as Li Jinshan. After I finished my business and returned to Shanghai, I went to Room 12 of the Pingqiao Hotel this morning to ask about Li Jinshan. According to the tea attendant, Li is now at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Tibet Road, so I went to that place and saw Wang and suspected that he was Li Jinshan, so I stepped forward to ask, etc. The head of the detective office verified the confession and found that Tian's words were hesitant and suspicious, so he ordered him to be detained. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special District Court. Wang Yaotang, a lawyer from the detective office, rose to state the case, saying that the detective office had not yet investigated the truth of the case, and whether Tian's confession was true, so he did not prosecute him and requested permission to detain him for investigation. He then submitted the half card as evidence. According to the previous complaint of Wang, the detective, Tian Xinsong confessed as above. Judge Wu Tingqi ordered Tian to be detained until the 30th of this month for further questioning.</p>

<h3 id="e181">Jin Shunxing Fishing Boat Sunk in Collision <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>▲ Eight Fishermen Killed</p>
<p>▲ Yu Shun Has Left Shanghai</p>
<p>▲ This Matter Still Needs Investigation</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Yu Shun" steamer came to Shanghai from Xiamen on the 12th of this month to unload cargo and passengers and was then sent to Yantai to load Liu Zhennian's troops and head to Wenzhou, Zhejiang. The steamer arrived in Shanghai just as the new and old managers of the company were changing over and did not stay long before leaving the port. The steamer was returning to Shanghai from Xiamen when, at 3:00 PM on the 11th, it was near the Putuo sea area when a "Jin Shunxing" fishing boat loaded with fresh fish was returning to Shenjiamen. The "Yu Shun" steamer was also traveling from south to north when it approached the fishing boat but did not sound its whistle. The "Jin Shunxing" boat failed to avoid it and was hit in the middle. The fishing boat was cut in two and immediately sank. The "Yu Shun" steamer immediately turned back to help rescue. There were four small sampans and fishermen Liu Guoquan, Lin Aman, Liu Anbang, Liu Ashi, Wu Yangmu, Wu Yangdan, Huang Tonghui, Wang Zhongsheng, and others, eight in total, who fell into the sea and drowned. The remaining 19 crew members were rescued by civilian ships (4 people), while the remaining 15 people climbed onto the "Yu Shun." The "Yu Shun" steamer's passengers saw these shipwrecked crew members and scrambled to donate money, raising more than 90 yuan. On the 12th, when the ship arrived in Shanghai, the "Yu Shun" steamer crew sent the 15 rescued people to the Quanzhang Association in Longhua Road, where Mr. Guo in the association took them in. The "Jin Shunxing" was a newly built fishing boat. A telegram has been sent to the boat owner asking them to come to Shanghai to negotiate with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. The bereaved family of the 8 deceased has requested compensation. The fellow villagers are requested to provide assistance. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has not yet received a detailed report from the "Yu Shun" steamer on this matter and has not yet expressed an opinion.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Taxpayers' Association Requests Restoration of Water Prices <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>▲ Letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council</p>
<p>The Taxpaying Chinese Residents' Association yesterday received a letter from the Dinghai Fellow Association forwarding a letter to the Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, saying that the Dinghai residents in Shanghai wrote that there are fellow villagers living in single-family houses at Nos. 2530 and 2531 Zhoujiazui Road. The rent for each house is 18 yuan per month, and there are five houses in total, with two houses occupied by laundry businesses. Before the installation of water meters, the water fee was 1 yuan and 25 cents per month for each house. After the installation of water meters, the water fee for the five houses was 76 yuan in just 28 days. The water fee has always been borne by the landlord. Now the landlord wants the tenants to install water meters themselves, but the tenants are mostly laborers and cannot afford to install them. Yesterday morning, the water company closed the water supply, causing the tenants to suddenly have no water and unable to live in peace. They requested that a solution be found to provide relief. Therefore, please forward the request for negotiation for the public good. It is noted that the water fee problem has been solved by the Council convening representatives from the water company, real estate association, and other parties to negotiate a win-win solution. Now the water company wants to solve the problem by cutting off the water, which may only increase the seriousness of the security problem and cause anxiety for the Director-General and the Association. Furthermore, the purpose of installing water meters to calculate water fees is to control waste, not to increase the water company's revenue, which is something that the Director-General attaches special importance to. Now, the water company has not achieved the purpose of controlling waste, and the so-called discount method has changed from 7.5% to an increase of one-third, which is about 10%. Isn't the installation of water meters for the purpose of increasing prices? In view of the above reasons, please ask the Council to quickly order the water company to restore the water supply to maintain the lives of the people. This letter is addressed to the Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council.</p>

<p>According to the Shanghai Times, the owner of the Russian fishing boat "Sakto," which arrived in Shanghai from Vladivostok on Sunday, reported to the Commercial Affairs Office of the China Eastern Railway in Shanghai that five teenagers mutinied on the boat 60 miles after it left Vladivostok, imprisoning him for two days without water or food. Later, during a storm, they forced him to hand over his pistol and ordered him to drive the boat. After safely navigating two major dangers, when they arrived in Shanghai, Mr. Ke took the opportunity to leave the boat and wandered blindly for two days before finding the China Eastern Railway Office to report everything. Coincidentally, Patrol Chief Wu Feide of the Water Police Station boarded the boat to inquire. A teenager admitted that the boat owner had shown a certificate, but his behavior was suspicious. After being notified by the China Eastern Railway Office, the boat was returned to the China Eastern Railway Office and the five teenagers were ordered to disembark. The boat is now guarded by the original boat owner, Mr. Ke, and a crew member, and efforts will be made to send it back to Vladivostok.</p>

<p>▲ Road Police Detain Mr. Li for Six Hours</p>
<p>Mr. Li Songquan, the manager of the well-known Shanghai taxi company, Lili Automobile Company, was suddenly detained by the road police at the North Station yesterday morning for six hours.

In order to provide meticulous service, Mr. Li personally took care of each train arrival. Yesterday morning, Mr. Li and road policeman Zhao had a disagreement over the arrangement of other companies' cars. Before they could say a few words, he was detained for six hours without reason. Although the senior officials of the Road Bureau tried their best to intercede for him, they were unable to release Mr. Li in the morning. Mr. Li was unhappy after the incident and has sought legal remedies.</p>

<p>▲ Silent After Meeting</p>
<p>▲ Water Police Provide Guidance</p>
<p>Ye Yinbao, 21 years old, from Sanbei, is a cigarette paper shopkeeper. He married a fellow villager, Tong Xinghua (18 years old), in April of this year. Ye lost his job due to the Shanghai war and planned to move his small family to his father Ye Shengzhang's home at No. 39 Anping Street in the city. However, Xinghua did not want to live with her in-laws and preferred to live alone with her sister in Xiangyanqiao, so the couple was often at odds. They once went to court but still reconciled. Yesterday, Ye went to Xiangyanqiao again to call his wife home. The two walked to the Waibaidu Bridge, but Xinghua said that she was tired and could not walk and asked to take a tram. Ye refused because he had no money with him. The two started arguing again. Ye became extremely angry and stood on the bridge, suddenly jumping into the Suzhou Creek to commit suicide. Xinghua was shocked and went to the Xinguang Wharf alone. Because her husband was dead, she had no face to go home and also jumped into the river to commit suicide. Fortunately, she was rescued by others and sent to the Central Police Station. However, Ye was rescued by the night watchman No. 6 shortly after entering the water and sent to the Customs Water Police Station. After changing his dry clothes, the Central Police Station telegraphed to inform them that Xinghua had been rescued after jumping into the river. The police station immediately sent someone to bring Xinghua back. The couple met silently at the Water Police Station. The police officers persuaded them and ordered detective Shen Changshan to summon Ye's father, Ye Shengzhang, to the case and take the two of them back.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Fictitious Money Shop Cheats Deposits <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Xing Shenzhi, from Jiangyin, recently colluded with Gu Bingyao and Qian Yangsheng to lease the premises at No. 28 Ruyili, Henan Road, and set up a fictitious Hongxing Money Shop. Xing acted as the street runner, while Gu and Qian served as the managers and deputy managers, touting for deposits all day long, boasting about how sufficient their capital was. Those who did not know the inside story came to them in droves, depositing cash into the shop, collecting checkbooks, and issuing checks. When the check holders went to them to cash the checks, Xing and the others had already defrauded a large sum of money and divided it up and escaped. The affected shops reported to the chief patrol station in charge and requested an investigation. It was not until around 1:00 AM yesterday that detective Gao Zhen discovered that Xing Shenzhi was hiding in Room 372 of the Dajiangnan Hotel on Fujian Road and immediately rushed to arrest him. Under questioning at the police station, he confessed that Gu Bingyao lived at No. 13 Tianbaoli, Xinjiang Road, Zhabei, and that he did not know Qian Yangsheng's whereabouts. When detective Gao went to Gu's home, Gu had already absconded after hearing the news. At 9:00 AM, Xing Shenzhi was sent to the First Special District Local Court. Judge Liu Yugui summoned him for questioning. The police station lawyer Qian Xunjiu said that the defendant had colluded with others to set up a fictitious money shop to defraud deposits. It has now been found that the Dunyu Cloth Shop at No. 188 Jiujiang Road had deposited 1,008 taels of silver, the Gengyu Silk Shop at No. 710 Jiu'anli, Fujian Road had deposited 800 taels of silver, the Defengchang at No. 70 Hongyufang, Zhengjia Wood Bridge had deposited 500 yuan in foreign currency, and the Lixing Foreign Firm at No. 2 Beijing Road had deposited 550 taels of silver. The Qinfeng Yarn Factory at No. 161 Rue Labrousse in the French Concession had deposited 619 taels of silver. In addition, there may be other victims who still need to be investigated. He requested a postponement of the hearing and a continued investigation. Staff members from Dunyu and other shops were sent to the court to state the circumstances of the fraud. Judge Liu then questioned the defendant and ordered him to be detained and the hearing postponed for further investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Yang Xixian Debt Case Criminal Prosecution Unfounded <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2 p.m., the Fifth Tribunal of the Special First District heard the case of Yang Xixian's debt dispute with Zhang Tinggui. The judge first asked Yang Xixian when he bought the American cotton from Meian Foreign Firm. Yang replied that he did not buy the American cotton from Meian, but from Zhang Tinggui personally. He had bought it several times, the last time being 100 bales, worth over 14,000 taels. At that time, three checks were issued, two expiring on October 18, and the date of the remaining one forgotten. Yang also stated that after buying the yarn factory from the Japanese in 1931, he added yarn spindles. Unexpectedly, the market has been sluggish recently, and the January 28th Incident last year further exacerbated the situation. Finally, the funds could not be turned over, leading to a mid-way setback. There was no intention to defraud and take property. Zhang Tinggui then appeared in court. The judge asked whether the American cotton was sold by Meian Foreign Firm. Zhang replied that it was sold personally, but the goods came from Meian. The judge further asked how the over 14,000 taels of debt would be handled. Yang replied that he was trying his best to find a way. The judge further asked why the bank did not honor the checks he issued. Yang replied that the bank heard that the factory's finances were very tight, so it returned them. Lawyer Li Zuyu, representing Yang, stood up and stated that Longmao was a limited company, and Yang was the manager. All the funds involved were advanced by the company, and the orders were placed by the company, not for personal business. Therefore, the criminal charge should not stand. The police lawyer stated that after the defendant bought the American cotton, he mortgaged it to the bank and transferred the funds for other uses. Therefore, the police believed that there was a crime of defrauding and taking property. Lawyer Li stated that the checks issued at ordinary times were honored by the bank. This time, the return of the checks was unexpected. Moreover, all the American cotton received was in the factory warehouse and had not been mortgaged to the bank. The judge asked Yang whether the factory was operating as usual when he bought the American cotton. Yang replied that the factory only announced its liquidation on November 6. The judge further asked whether there was any transaction with Zhongnan a few days before October 18. Yang replied that there was, and asked to check the account books. Lawyer Li then presented the account books. The judge asked whether the 100 bales of American cotton were mortgaged to Zhongnan. Yang replied that they were still in the factory's third warehouse for spinning. The judge said to the plaintiff that the defendant admitted to owing you money, but the check was returned due to credit issues. Lawyer Li stood up and said that the plaintiff did not understand the true situation beforehand, and heard that the factory owed a huge amount of money, so there seemed to be a suspicion of fraud. Now that the general situation is clear, could the court dismiss the criminal part? The police lawyer said that according to the report of the plaintiff Zhang Tinggui, the defendant mortgaged the goods to Zhongnan in October, and announced the liquidation in November. Therefore, the police believed that the defendant was suspected of fraud. Now that the lawsuit is in progress, the plaintiff and defendant can reconcile outside the court, so the private prosecution can be withdrawn, but the public prosecution cannot be withdrawn immediately. Lawyer Li stated that the factory's dealings with Zhongnan used up to 130,000 taels at most, and the last time the check was returned, only 22,000 taels were overdrawn. Therefore, the return of the check was unexpected by the defendant. If the police believe that the non-payment of the check is fraud, then all ordinary loans that are repaid with checks but not honored will be considered fraud, which seems to be too excessive in law. Finally, the judge announced that Yang Xixian was innocent of the criminal charge. If the police have any objections, they can file another lawsuit in the civil court, and then declared the court adjourned.</p>

<h3 id="e195">Recent News from the China Life Insurance Advancement Society <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>According to a report from the China Life Insurance Advancement Society on the life insurance business in the United States, according to the reports of various life insurance companies in the United States, in 1931, among the compensation paid due to the death of the insured, there were US$60.2 million, equivalent to 30 million yuan in Chinese currency. The insured (commonly known as policyholders) were about 97,800 people who died within one year of purchasing life insurance. Among them, 25,000 people died within three months of purchasing insurance, and more than 1,000 people died within one week of purchasing insurance. Several hundred people died after the insurance medical examination before receiving the insurance policy. However, because the insurance premium was paid in full when the application was signed on the spot to the life insurance company, the insurance policy took effect immediately. Even if the insurance policy has not been issued, the family can receive compensation. From this, we can know the impermanence of human life.</p>

<h3 id="e202">Symphony of Peace and War <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>│Contradiction and Ridicule│</p>
<p>The kind and amiable old pastor is preaching about "universal love" and going to "heaven"; the men and women in the seats are singing hymns and making sincere prayers. This church is truly filled with an atmosphere of peace and kindness, and pleasant and sweet singing. Where is heaven? Heaven is here! Where is the God of peace? The God of peace is also here! So on Sundays when I have nothing to do, I often come to this hall to sit, seeking temporary comfort in my soul, and witnessing the appearance of the God of peace for a moment. However, this church is only three miles away from the park's target range. Every time there is a pious service, it is also the time when the Japanese army is training diligently. The sound of Gedeng's machine guns and the crackling of rifles always break the air in the hall. Inside the hall is a burst of singing and prayer, and outside the hall is a burst of gunfire, as if a symphony is being played. However, this song seems too ridiculous and contradictory! Comparing the two sides, one is a kind smile and the other is a ferocious murderous aura; one side is persuading you to return to heaven, and the other is sending you to the land of death; this side is a world of peace, harmony, joy, kindness, and the other side is a realm of terror, cruelty, death, and annihilation. Moreover, further speaking, the peace in the hall is genuinely outward, but who can say that the old pastor or the men and women will not reveal their ferocious faces and cruel means once they leave the church? This shows that the realization of peace is very difficult. And the Japanese army's guns and cannons, although they are drills and exercises, like the tricks of January 28th, there is always the possibility of a real performance, which shows that the danger of war is imminent.</p>
<p>Alas! Peace, war, this symphony is played everywhere and at all times at home, abroad, and all over the world. Don't you see the great powers desperately expanding their armaments? But at the disarmament conference, you also propose to limit airplanes and cannons; I also propose to save military spending. Isn't Japan, our eastern neighbor, always shouting about Sino-Japanese friendship and co-existence and co-prosperity? But he swallowed the fat meat of the Northeast in one gulp: Shanghai's Zhabei was also messed up by his airplanes and cannons. In addition, there are many such phenomena. Peace and war are symphonizing, it's really ridiculous! It's really contradictory!</p>

<p>— Yan Chonglou</p>
<p>│Is Sinful│</p>
<p>I talked about the sin of "cursing" in this journal a few days ago, and now I will talk about the sin of "flattery."</p>
<p>Except for Zilu, it can be said that no one is not "angry when they hear criticism and happy when they hear praise." Originally, if a person has a fault, then they have a fault, and if a person has praise, then they have praise. However, there is a kind of person in society who specializes in catering to the psychology of the world. If you have no praise, he will praise you, and even if you have a fault, he will praise you. This is the so-called art of flattery.</p>
<p>People who are good at flattery and ingratiating themselves can use various flattering techniques to flatter you in order to achieve their purpose of flattering you. On the side being flattered, because flattery makes people lose their minds, they will unknowingly fall into the art of flattery!</p>
<p>"People who flatter others have lost their nobility!" People who flatter others, although they have lost their noble personality, they can use the results of their flattery to act like bullies! Based on the above discussion, we can get a new discovery, which is! "The more a person exaggerates in front of others, the more servile he is."</p>
<p>Flattery is sinful, flattery is harmful, and if you want to prevent flattery, you must be able to fulfill the two principles of "fearing when you hear praise! rejoicing when you hear criticism!"</p>
<h3 id="e204">The Difficulty of Renting a House in the World <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Butong</p>
<p>│The Difficulty of Eating Comes Second│</p>
<p>"There is nothing more difficult than eating in the world." Although the problem of eating is the most difficult in the world, there are now economists and sociologists who are loaded with truckloads, wearing three thousand-degree nearsighted glasses, shaking their heads and studying, and generally in the near future,</p>
<p>Perhaps they can come up with a way for everyone to have food to eat, to solve the difficulty. So I think the most difficult thing in the world in the future will definitely not be eating, but renting a house.</p>
<p>I was originally an only child who came to Shanghai to make a living. But when I first arrived in Shanghai, it was really difficult to find a place to shelter from the wind and rain. When I saw the red rental sign and knocked on the door, eleven out of ten houses refused to rent to those without family. Later, I still relied on the kindness of an old uncle, who took on one hundred and twenty points of responsibility, to rent a small room just enough to accommodate my stinky body as a mansion at night.</p>
<p>It was terrible. Once it came to summer, the stuffiness and heat were still secondary, because I had been injected with a preventive vaccine and was not afraid of getting a fever, but thousands of bedbugs completely relied on me to provide food, and I couldn't bear some of the burden. So I decided to move to a better place. Suffer once, learn once, this time I decided to bring my wife and two children from the countryside to live with me, relying on the signboard to avoid bumping into the nails of those who refuse to rent to those without family.</p>
<p>I brought my wife and sons, saw the red rental sign, and knocked on the door. The landlady of the second landlord opened her mouth and asked how many people there were. I said two couples, two children, and a maid. The landlady of the second landlord said that there were no children in this house, and it was too troublesome to have children, so she wouldn't rent. I bumped into another nail, so when I saw the red rental sign, I first stuck my ears to the crack in the door to listen. Later, I heard the sound of children crying inside, so I hurriedly knocked on the door. The landlady of the second landlord shook her head incessantly when she saw me, and said repeatedly, "I won't rent, I won't rent. My own children are already making a terrible noise. If I bring two more, the house will collapse."</p>
<p>Napoleon said: There are no difficult words in the dictionary. If he comes to Shanghai, he will definitely say, "Renting a house is difficult."</p>

<p>— Fan Yanqiao</p>
<p>However, after experiencing more, Guang Ye became more powerful, and in addition to art, there were some conditions to consider. So among the twenty-odd dancing girls in the Neon Dance Hall, only one caught Mu Liang's eye, and this person was called Jiang Aili.</p>
<p>After eleven o'clock, more and more dancers came, and the band played even more powerfully. Pairs of dancers were colorful and mixed, which really fit the poem: "Falling flowers and butterflies fly in groups." Aili is a star in the Neon Dance Hall, and naturally very busy. It is not easy for Mu Liang to catch her. Mu Liang had to use champagne to curry favor with her, one bottle, two bottles, and in tense times, it was not certain that he would open half a dozen a night. Later, he understood the trick, so he simply went later, and he would never go back until the music stopped, the lights went out, and the dancing girls put on their capes and coats, ready to walk out of the dance hall. This was the opportunity to have a short secret word with Aili, but Aili was very playful, and no matter what, she always said:</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, I have a bad headache, I have to go to sleep, see you tomorrow." Before he could say anything more, she flew a kiss to him, and got into the pre-hired white-brand car and drove away.</p>
<p>When Mu Liang returned to the rented mansion in a trance, his wife was always fast asleep. It was not until the next day, when the sun was high, that Mu Liang got up and asked him, "What time did you come back last night? Where were you playing again?" Mu Liang stammered and made up a lie at will, and it passed.</p>
<p>One day, Mu Liang came back extraordinarily early, and his wife was also surprised, and said, "You don't have an appointment tonight."</p>
<p>Mu Liang said listlessly, "Um"!</p>
<p>Han Dashao Nai said, "Today's radio report said that the 19th Route Army retreated to the second line of defense, and Suzhou is going to be tight." Mu Liang only answered "Um" again. He felt that he was too unconcerned about national affairs, and reluctantly said again, "Really?" Han Dashao Nai said, "How can it not be true! I just heard the "Shen Bao Extra" being sold outside the door, and it also said the same, but there is also good news, we are about to make peace."</p>
<p>The last sentence was enough to cheer up Mu Liang and say:</p>
<p>"Anyway, we can't beat them, it's better to make peace as soon as possible, otherwise we will be shouting for long-term resistance in Luoyang. The essence of the southeast is about to end." It was rare that he was happy today. Since he fled to Shanghai to avoid the war, the criticism of national affairs has decreased day by day, or the air in the concession has a kind of incredible magic that makes people numb and decadent.</p>
<p>Han Dashao Nai was also excited a lot. She put down the velvet rope vest and needles in her hand, walked closer to him, sat down, and prepared to have a long conversation with him. Said:</p>
<p>"Thank God, let's end it soon. Living in this spiral shell is extremely boring. Walking six feet away has become our Jiangbei shed outside Suzhou City."</p>

<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>The other day, while visiting a large-scale exhibition, I ran into an old friend I hadn't seen in years. During our idle chat, he suddenly asked me directly, "What type of person do you fear the most?" I replied, "There are very few people I fear, but there is one type I fear the most."</p>
<p>He then asked, "What type of person is that? Surely not a robber?" I said, "No, I have no wealth. Why would I fear them?" He guessed again, "A kidnapper?" I said, "Even less likely. I don't have the qualifications for that." He continued, "Could it be those heroic figures who rob on the road and slaughter pigs?" I laughed, "The shabby clothes I wear and the fact that my purse is often 'bust' – what's there to fear?" He then guessed, "Perhaps you fear officials the most?" I said, "I never do anything illegal in my life, so why should I fear officials?"</p>
<p>My friend then laughed and said, "So, what kind of person do you fear?" I said, "I fear those thick-skinned fellows the most. As the saying goes, 'Nothing is difficult in the world, except for a thick face.' I fear those with thick faces the most. Suppose I criticize them for their lack of virtue and chastity, they readily reply, 'She's already been with every man, and I make a living from it.' Suppose I point out their thieving behavior, they unhesitatingly reply, 'I've been committing crimes all my life; it's just my old habit.' If I encounter people like this, I get a headache and have no way to deal with them."</p>
<p>Originally, in a society, a good society, the reason it can maintain its virtuous state is nothing other than morality, the so-called "a sense of shame and a sense of right and wrong, everyone has it". But thick-skinned people completely shatter a sense of shame and a sense of right and wrong. The little magic lantern of society is torn apart by them. How can we reason with them?</p>
<p>My friend nodded in agreement and then we parted ways at the exhibition.</p>

<p>Slowly walking through desolate suburbs, lost in thought, I wander alone. The setting sun casts a dim light on the river village. Fallen leaves from the woods descend like rain. Cold waves roll in from the docking area. Wisps of smoke entwine with the returning geese. Scattered fishing lights mirror the sleeping gulls. Alas, everything is a scene of autumn. My eyes strain towards the distant sky, filled with endless melancholy.</p>

<p>Unable to sleep on a cold night, the lamp flickers dimly. The quilt feels cold, and I sense the heavy frost. In the stillness, I hear the sound of falling leaves.

<h3 id="e211">Essential Requirements for Dyes <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Zuo Qi</p>
<p>The quality of dyes is generally judged by whether they fade or not. However, there are two different viewpoints on what is meant by "not fading." From the perspective of ordinary buyers, "not fading" refers to being resistant to light and washing. From the perspective of dyers and textile manufacturers, "not fading" has a much broader meaning. In addition to the two conditions mentioned above, dyes must also be able to withstand the various procedures involved in weaving. The essential requirements for dyes are described in detail below.</p>
<p>(1) Light Resistance: This is the most important point. If the color gradually loses its intensity and luster under the action of sunlight, it is said to fade; otherwise, it is said to be non-fading. However, among all the colors known today, none can absolutely withstand prolonged exposure to sunlight. All colors will fade to some extent, only at different speeds. Therefore, "non-fading" is a relative term.</p>
<p>The German scholar Gustave Schultz has divided dyes into several categories according to their light resistance. Those that can withstand sunlight for up to 30 days without fading are classified as first-class. Those that fade within three days or completely lose their color by the end of 28 days are classified as the lowest class.</p>
<p>(2) Wash Resistance: This refers to the ability to resist the action of boiling water or cold water and soap. Regarding this point, Schultz divides dyes into five categories, with those that do not fade in boiling water being classified as first-class and those that fade in cold water being classified as the lowest class. However, there are cases where the dye itself does not fade but bleeds into nearby white materials. Therefore, when distinguishing whether a fabric is wash-resistant, we must pay attention to two points: first, whether the water becomes discolored; second, whether the dye bleeds into nearby pure white materials.</p>
<p>(3) Rub Resistance: The color does not transfer to a white cloth when rubbed against it.</p>
<p>(4) Steam Resistance: The dye on the fabric must not show any signs of weakening under the action of steam.</p>
<p>(5) Iron Resistance: The dye on the fabric must be able to withstand the heat of the iron without peeling off.</p>
<p>(6) Smoke Resistance: Fabrics that need to be bleached after dyeing, such as felt carpets, are often smoked with sulfur. Therefore, the dye used must be able to resist the action of sulfur without changing.</p>
<p>Dyes are classified into acid dyes, basic dyes, sulfide dyes, direct dyes, mordant dyes, etc. Since their properties are different, their resistance or fastness to various actions also varies. Among them, the color dyed with mordant dyes is the most fast and does not change easily when exposed to sunlight, water washing, alkalis, friction, or hot irons. It is a pity that the dyeing method is more complicated.</p>

<p>▲ Importance of Punctuation</p>
<p>This story is not something I fabricated. I saw it in a Chinese textbook. It is very interesting and has some literary merit, so it can be used as a topic of conversation after dinner. I have no intention of plagiarizing or picking up leftovers.</p>
<p>There was a wealthy man named Zhang who was old and had no sons, only a daughter. He married a man into his family. Many years later, Zhang's concubine gave birth to a son, named Yifei. So the family all called him A-Yi.</p>
<p>When Yifei was four years old, Zhang became very ill. According to Chinese customs, the son-in-law has the right to inherit the property. So,</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>the concubine was deeply worried that the son-in-law would seize the property, and even cried! So she approached Zhang. Zhang then wrote a will for her and said, "But you must be patient for a long time before you can be free from worry!" At the same time, he summoned his son-in-law and falsely said, "A-Yi is young and unreliable. All my property is given to you, but you must support him and his mother!" He also took out a will for him, and read:</p>
<p>Zhang Yifei not my son family property all give to my son-in-law outsiders may not contest</p>
<p>After Zhang died, the son-in-law took possession of the entire inheritance and treated Yifei as a servant. Of course, excessive oppression will inevitably lead to stronger resistance. So Yifei, under oppression, went to the authorities to seek justice and filed a lawsuit to recover the property. The son-in-law presented Zhang's will to the official, who read it and found that it was the same as the will presented by Yifei, except that the son-in-law's will had no punctuation. So he said to Zhang's son-in-law, "Your father-in-law, because Yifei was young, was afraid that he would seize the property and be harmed by you. So he deliberately made the will seem as if Yifei was not his son, and he did not use punctuation, clearly deceiving you to manage these properties for a few years!" He then took out Yifei's will and read:</p>
<p>Zhang Yifei, my son also, family property all give; my son-in-law, outsider, may not contest</p>
<p>The official then ruled that Zhang's property should all belong to Yifei. The above story is to show the disadvantages of not using punctuation. So it seems that the modern advocacy of new-style punctuation has this meaning!</p>

<h3 id="e213">The Autobiography of a Rickshaw Puller <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Kuang Wenbing</p>
<p>Next door to my stall selling bedsheets is a small hotel, located in a desolate area of Zhabei. Although that's how it is, there are still many coolies, rickshaw pullers, and short-trousered friends hauling mud who come and go. The hotel relies entirely on them. They are truly the world's heavy drinkers. Eating seems secondary. A catty of white liquor, two shots of unrefined wine, that's what each of them can drink down. When they get drunk, their faces turn red, and veins appear on their legs. That's when they're at their strongest. So they sing loudly, so they forget the hypocrisy, coldness, cruelty, and the various pains of life. One day, I was reading Bai Juyi's "The Charcoal Seller" until the line "Pitifully, the clothes on his body are thin, he worries about the low price of charcoal and wishes for colder weather," stroking the scroll and reciting at length, when their yelling completely startled me out of my thoughts. So I stepped out the door and saw a rickshaw puller sitting cross-legged at a square table at the hotel entrance, his drunken state hazy, almost triumphant. I unintentionally asked:</p>
<p>"Why are you so happy?" This touched his heartstrings, and he told me in a torrent of words:</p>
<p>"In this day and age, business is really not working out. Thirty-six trades, none of them are profitable. Eleven years ago, I was a carpenter in × village in Haimen. I earned two jiao a day, and I struggled to live frugally for three years, accumulating one hundred yuan, and married a good wife. Who knew that my fate would get even worse from then on? Just ten months later, she gave birth to a small child. One was not enough; the next day, her stomach suddenly cramped, and she gave birth to another one. That was terrible! At that time, business in the town was also slow. There weren't even two days of work in three days, and we were often hungry. Later, a few good friends pooled together two hundred yuan and started a carpentry shop ourselves. The workers were lazy and sloppy, and in less than half a year, the shop was forced to close. It was really worrying. I don't know why, but I suddenly thought of coming to Shanghai to pull a rickshaw.</p>
<p>Life in hardship, passing the days like years, pulling a rickshaw is not a life after all!</p>
<p>Fortunately, I have a naturally strong frame. My arms were trained with an axe (stretching out his right hand forcefully), so pulling a rickshaw doesn't feel too tiring. It's just these two legs (patting his legs) that can't take it. At first, after pulling for three days,</p>
<p>my legs ached to the bone, and even my back was sore. Lying on the bed, I couldn't catch my breath for a long time, and I couldn't stretch my legs straight, and bending them was even more painful. I lay in bed for a full week before gradually recovering. So I went back to pulling, and I've been pulling until now. My bones are all stiff! Alas! I've simply lost all feeling. Eleven years, ah!</p>
<p>Speaking of the income from pulling a rickshaw, it's really getting worse every year. The number of pullers is only increasing, but the licenses are limited! It can't exceed ten thousand. Renting a shift car costs one thousand yuan. Renting in the concession is even more unbearable! One dollar and forty cents, from six o'clock in the morning to ten o'clock at night, is considered handing over a day's fate. After returning the car to the company, there are less than a few dozen copper coins left. I put them in my wife's hand, and she just smiles bitterly for a while.</p>
<p>If you want business to be good, you only need a sudden burst of wind and rain. Last year, on August 27th, there was that big storm. The floodwater in the street reached my knees, but I was stuck at home with diarrhea, watching people earn money quickly with dry eyes. A'nian next door earned nine dollars that day. It was a great opportunity, but I missed it! (Pounding his chest with his hand). Pulling a rickshaw, it's not good to eat too much. If you eat too much, not only can you not pull, but also your stomach will hurt. The people sitting in the car don't care, they always kick and scold. In eleven years, I have rarely eaten a full meal on time. I always buy a sesame cake to eat here, or eat a bowl of porridge there, or drink half a catty of old white wine, or take two shots of unrefined wine. A family of four, two small children, myself and my wife. Fortunately, she didn't give birth to a third one! The monthly rent is one and a half dollars, for a dark and gloomy loft. Four hundred and fifty cash for rice a day. This year is good, the price of rice is cheap, and we can still buy white rice with four hundred and fifty cash. Two jiao for vegetables and tofu, plus wine and cigarettes, it costs at least fifteen dollars a month to make ends meet. Fortunately, my wife sells water caltrops every day and can earn a few hundred cash to make up for the shortfall. Otherwise, I'd really be too poor to make ends meet.</p>
<p>In this day and age, business is really not working out. Pulling a rickshaw is not a life. But what can I do!</p>
<p>At this time, his drunken state seemed to have subsided. I also, driven by the demands of life, said goodbye to him and returned to my own room to write.</p>

<h3 id="e214">The Art of Eating <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Jun</p>
<p>Speaking of student life, it is indeed meaningful, especially the issue of eating. Usually, you can be late or leave early for class, and some wealthy students treat the school as a hotel, but as soon as the dinner bell rings, they scramble to be the first, afraid of being left behind. That kind of spirit, except for watching a ball game, is not easily seen. If you are one step behind, those who arrive first have already issued a mobilization order, devouring food like wolves, each showing their skills, and you can only sigh at the empty bowl. The spirit of humility is absolutely impossible to find in the dining hall. Therefore, for the sake of eating, strange and bizarre tricks are played out in society every day.</p>
<p>I boarded at school, and for the sake of eating, I don't know how many losses I suffered. Therefore, I had to study countermeasures on how to deal with this kind of environment. Now, I dare not keep my research secret, and I am publishing it for everyone to see.</p>
<p>The art of eating, in other words, is the art of eating vegetables. There is a lot of rice and little vegetables. According to the law of supply and demand in economics, the demand for vegetables naturally exceeds the supply. The policy is the "accuracy, patience, ruthlessness" three-character doctrine.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about accuracy. When eating, you should arrive on time, never be late, the so-called "past due is not waiting," sitting and missing the opportunity. The first thing to do when you sit down is to see clearly which dishes are good and what the ingredients are. For example, for meat, see clearly which piece is moderately lean and fat, of good quality, and large in quantity. Never focus on quantity and forget quality, or you will choose a bone and then be greatly disappointed. Therefore, you must be prepared before picking up your chopsticks, so as not to have nothing to aim for and be outdone by those who are quick-eyed and fast-handed. There is also a relationship between the order in which you eat dishes. You should eat the larger pieces first, such as fish, meat, and meatballs, because there are not many of these. But for things like stir-fried shredded pork, no one will carefully pick out the shredded pork to eat, so it doesn't matter if you're a bit slower.</p>
<p>Let's talk about patience again. When the dish is in hand, sometimes the dish is too hot. You should be patient no matter what. If you can't be patient, people will send one piece after another to their mouths, and there will be very few dishes in the bowl. Wouldn't you lose out? Sometimes you take advantage and enjoy more delicious food. People can't help but show displeasure, or mock you a few times. You can just turn a deaf ear and remain patient. Speaking of ruthlessness, in addition to accuracy and patience, you must also be ruthless. One piece after another, one spoonful after another, be as ruthless as possible, otherwise the things in the plate will be swept away. Haven't you heard that "nothing is difficult in the world, only fearing a thick face"? If your face isn't thick and your heart isn't ruthless, you can forget about getting a good deal. I think this accuracy, patience, and ruthlessness three-character doctrine will be of some help when eating.</p>
<p>Short Story</p>
<h3 id="e215">The Narrow Definition of Law <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Cheng</p>
<p>The main room in a certain county bureau in the morning was filled with smoke, as if there was a fire. The electric light was dyed a dim yellow. A couple was lying on the exquisite brass bed, puffing out clouds of smoke, thus bathing the entire room in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>They smoked wildly for a long time, as if their spirits were aroused. Then they opened the talk box. The man spoke first, "Alas, the cases these past two days are mostly from poor and miserable people. There is no profit to be made!" At this time, the woman had just finished smoking a pipe and hurriedly drank a sip of hot tea. She made a gulping sound, and then exhaled a long breath, but the remaining smoke had disappeared. She said, "Ah, why should my lord bother himself! Like that opium case the day before yesterday, one case is worth several. How can we have that kind of fat meat every day?"</p>
<p>There was a finger-snapping sound outside the door. Then a servant walked into the room, standing in front of the bed with his hands at his sides, and reported to the man, "Reporting to the bureau chief: Someone outside reports that Wang Gongguan in a certain village is privately smoking opium. The reporter is waiting for the bureau chief to send a team to search and arrest them." The man smiled upon hearing this, and said, "Tell the chief inspector to catch them." As he spoke, he loaded another pipe and began to puff away. The servant responded and left.</p>
<p>After about half a cigarette time, the servant came in again and said, "The director of the Finance Bureau, the director of the Construction Bureau, and the director of the Education Bureau have come to visit." The man said "Please!" The servant went out and led the three guests in. The man and woman stood up at the same time. The man stepped forward and greeted them, "It's rare for the three of you to come together. What brings you here?"</p>
<p>"We're happy today, so we came to play eight rounds of mahjong with you!"</p>
<p>"Good, welcome!"</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>"...................."</p>
<p>After a round of greetings in different tones, the sound of dominoes dancing on the table could be heard. The woman was still standing by the man's side, watching their mahjong battle.</p>
<p>After two rounds of mahjong, the chief inspector returned. As soon as he entered the door, he smiled at the man and said, "The evidence in Wang Gongguan's opium case has already been secured, and we have also caught a gambling case and two private prostitutes in the vicinity!"</p>
<p>"The bureau chief's business is really good!" the three guests said in unison, praising him.</p>
<p>At about two o'clock in the morning, the mahjong game came to an end. The three guests were still not satisfied and insisted that the host accompany them to seek pleasure. The host, of course, readily agreed, and they set off together towards the pleasure quarters. Before they reached their destination, many prostitutes leaning against their doors saw them from afar and were so frightened that they retreated inside and closed their doors. When they went to knock on the door, a trembling voice inside answered, "We're not doing business anymore. Please spare us, lords!"</p>
<p>"Who said we're here to catch you? We're here to have fun!" the men outside said.</p>
<p>After a while, the door slowly opened. The lords walked in with smiles, finally restoring the frightened souls of the people inside!</p>
<p>The sound of singing, which had been absent from the air for a long time, was finally able to be revealed loudly tonight, as if it had received a special pardon.</p>
<p>Modern Psychology</p>
<h3 id="e216">A Glimpse of Road C <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Yi</p>
<p>The click-clack of leather shoes echoed in the B Hotel; then, with a "whoosh," a modern girl wearing a fox fur stole, a coat, and high heels flashed out from the closing spring door. Before she had taken a step away from the door, a group of rickshaw pullers, as if they knew what was coming, were already waiting outside. Seeing that it was a superior girl, they became even more eager to solicit her. "Where to?" they all asked at the same time, scrambling to ask. "To W Lane on Road A." "Come on..." "How much?" "Is 300 cash okay?" Then they said 250 cash, even 200 cash."</p>
<p>Ha! Rickshaws were also having a big price cut.</p>
<p>One made up their mind and walked a few steps reluctantly.</p>
<p>Hello, Mister... I can't even shout over the noise, the welcoming sounds of "come, come, come" were singing in unison, and some were even patting the cushions, almost snatching her with their hands. I had never encountered such attentive rickshaw pullers before. It must be that they are particularly polite to women.</p>
<p>"Come on, you say..." "He also says come..." The rest also chimed in, "Hey! Come here!" The noise was so loud that she, who had just emerged from a moment of sweet pleasure, was of course not very clear-headed at the moment. Her brain seemed very tired, and her alluring eyes didn't seem able to lift their lids. How could she stand the loud clamor! With a huff, she said crisply, "I don't want it!" If I were to completely translate his original words, this strange national language must be his new invention. It was truly funny to hear, and I was confused by him. He had already guessed her intentions. The modern psychology, again, slanted her eyes toward her, pointed her hand to the seat, and made a ugly face that was neither smiling nor crying. Before the strange and bizarre show was over, she had already jumped into the rickshaw, pointed her hand in the direction of ×, and sped off in a puff of smoke.</p>
<p>Oh! So that's how business is done.</p>
<p>I sighed to the general despair of the rickshaw pullers and said, "The snipe and clam fight, the fisherman benefits. You guys were able to do it, and I really admire it." However, the quarreling rickshaws didn't seem to understand what I meant, and didn't express anything. I was also disappointed. Alas!</p>
