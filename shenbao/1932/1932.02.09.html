<p>二十年來。我國無日不在兵戎擾攘的戰亂中。每一次戰爭的結果。都是以斑斑的碧血和纍纍的白骨。築成新的「英雄」與「梟傑」的「神武之寳座。」裝成新的「勝利之王冠。」換言之。即是「一將成名萬骨枯。」成功的是一二野心家。而犧牲的却是無量數迫於生活不得不以戰爭效死爲職業的勞苦大衆這種戰爭。正是斷送我們民族的腐爛劑。而這種犧牲。尤其只是爲個人作工具。毫無意義與價値。</p>
<p>自去年九一八禍變爆發以來。日本帝國主義者。直接以暴力脅迫我民族。屠殺我人民。其殘酷兇暴。直爲迫害全人類的惡魔。爲爭取我民族與國家的生存自由。並維護公理與正義。我民族之英勇戰士。如龍江苦戰暴軍之馬占山所部。最近之李杜丁超所部及東北各地之義勇軍。與此次上海奮死抗暴之十九路軍等。其苦戰其犧牲。乃眞具有重大之價値。足以動天地而泣鬼神。蓋此戰之意義。乃眞爲反日帝國主義之革命戰爭。而此戰之犧牲者。乃眞爲維護我民族與國家之英烈。在歷史上實具有永遠不可磨滅之偉大與榮光。　　我們對於此次偉大戰爭中爲維護我民族之生存而犧牲之英勇將士。固不應僅表示熱烈之同情與誠摯之欽崇而已。其尤重要者。爲對於烈士的家屬。應作積極有效的救濟與善後。</p>
<p>我們認爲政府對於此種工作。即應作整個具體的計劃。如撫卹烈士遺族。如開辦遺族學校（與南京現有之遺族學校意義不同）如劃定撫卹遺族固定基金。對於殘廢的戰士。籌設安善處所。或工廠。或固定撫卹基金。都屬刻不容緩至於我人民。也應節衣縮食。助成這種有意義的事業。　　必如此。才能使死難烈士的遺族。不至流離失所。必如此。才能使英勇的戰士。負荷其職責捨命衝向前陣。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Fierce Battles on the Zhabei Front: Intense Fighting Day and Night, One Enemy Plane and Four Japanese Soldiers Captured Yesterday (the 8th), the battles on the Zhabei front were intense throughout the day. The sounds of artillery roared without ceasing. From 8 a.m. yesterday, Japanese soldiers continued to fire from the Hongkou Garden, bombing Zhanghuabang and the Zhabei area. Our troops occasionally retaliated, but remained calm. The Japanese soldiers, unable to fathom our intentions, did not dare to advance a single step. Around noon, with the help of reinforcements, the Japanese soldiers again launched an offensive towards Zhabei. <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Bloody Battle on Xibaoxing Road: Around noon yesterday, more than a thousand Japanese soldiers suddenly attacked our army's positions on Keming Road and Xibaoxing Road (because there were five or six hundred Japanese soldiers here who were surrounded by our troops in the battle on the evening of the 6th and are currently under siege). Our troops immediately rose up to fight back. The Japanese soldiers first bombarded with field guns, followed by steel cannons and machine guns. They also used hand grenades, throwing them at our troops and taking the opportunity to charge. Seeing their fierce attack, our troops immediately ordered a full-scale defense and used mortars to block their charge. After about two hours of fierce fighting, the Japanese soldiers gradually felt unable to hold on. They regrouped and fought again after their reinforcements arrived. Our troops immediately feigned a retreat. The Japanese soldiers charged straight in. At this time, our troops had already ambushed soldiers near the telephone bureau and along both sides of the Songhu Road railway. Therefore, when the enemy soldiers approached the railway, our ambushing troops rose up and intercepted them. At the same time, the soldiers who had retreated earlier took advantage of the situation to counterattack. Thus, the Japanese soldiers were surrounded on all sides and cut off into four sections. Even if they wanted to retreat quickly, it was too late. More than seven hundred of them were killed by our troops, and some were surrounded. The rest fled towards Keming Road, escaping across the Henanbang Bridge. The Japanese soldiers later came to reinforce, but the overall situation was already lost. Around 5 p.m., the sounds of gunfire gradually subsided. Our troops firmly defended the line at the entrance of Xibaoxing Road.</p>
<p>Enemy Suffers Setback at Baziqiao: After the Japanese soldiers' three failed attacks on Baziqiao, around 9 a.m. yesterday, they again used field guns, steel cannons, and machine guns to shoot at our troops. We immediately retaliated with artillery, bravely engaging the enemy. The Japanese army used armored vehicles to charge, but they were first repelled by our troops with bombs. Almost all of our troops rose up to pursue them. The sounds of machine guns and hand grenades continued without ceasing. At that time, the situation of this charging and that retreating occurred repeatedly. More than four hundred Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded. Soon, Japanese reinforcements arrived, and they were able to temporarily hold their ground, but they had already approached the Tiantong'an Road area. Fighting continued until about 2 p.m. When the Japanese soldiers still couldn't hold on, they retreated towards North Sichuan Road around 3 p.m. At the same time, fearing that Chinese troops were hiding in civilian houses, the Japanese soldiers set fire to the Doulean Road area.</p>
<p>Enemy Plane Shot Down by Us: Around 2 p.m. yesterday, Japanese soldiers sent four more planes to Zhabei to scout our military situation. One of them flew towards Maigen Road's Sun Temple around 3 p.m., very close to the ground. As nearby residents were in a state of turmoil, it was hit by our troops with anti-aircraft guns. The plane immediately flipped over and crashed. Four Japanese soldiers on board were captured by our defending troops at that location.</p>
<p>Japanese Shells Hit the Concession: A Japanese shell hit the Zhuyi Tobacco Company at 716 Longji Lane, North Zhejiang Road, during lunch hour. The shell landed in the front courtyard, where stacks of cigarette boxes and packs were stored, but it did not explode. The police were notified, and a Chinese police officer picked it up. The caliber of the shell's head was about six inches in diameter, coated in paint, weighed about dozens of pounds, and had the number 208 on it, with a changed character on top. The company only suffered damage to a few glass windows. Another shell landed behind the Zhuyi Tobacco Company's building but did not explode. Since the residents of that building had already evacuated, it was not convenient to open the door and remove the shell for the time being. Yet another shell landed on the wall of the lavatory of the road's Huashang Hotel, creating a hole before falling to the ground. The police took it away. Furthermore, around 7 a.m. yesterday, two shells fell from the sky on the streets near Minhang Road and Wusong Road in Hongkou. One also landed near the residence of an Indian police officer in Hongkou. At 2 p.m., a huge shell fell on the roof of house number 519 Dengtuo Road, near Zhoujiazui Road, blowing up the roof. Fortunately, no one was injured. Around 4 p.m., the Japanese army retreated from the Hujiamuqiao and Hongzhen Wuhua Road area, with guns and cannons firing randomly. As a result, many stray bullets flew over the northern section of Gongping Road. Also, behind a certain house in Xihongqing Lane, Nichengqiao West, close to the riverbank, a huge shell, three inches long and as thick as a teacup, suddenly fell from the sky yesterday afternoon, shattering a section of old wood and rolling into the river. In addition, a huge shell landed on the open ground behind Xinjiag Garden around 7 a.m. yesterday, about four inches long, without causing any injuries. Furthermore, at 1:45 p.m. yesterday, a shell landed at number 160, the Shanghai Ice Factory at the intersection of Diswei Road and Tangen Road in Hongkou, immediately causing a fire. The fire brigade dispatched vehicles to put it out, and luckily it was quickly extinguished. In addition, a shell landed in Gaoyang Lane, Yangjiabang Road on the same road, setting fire to houses, which were also extinguished by the fire brigade.</p>
<p>Foreigners Praise Our Army: Two reporters from the Da Mei Evening News went to the front line of our army yesterday to observe. Upon their return, they wrote an article published in the newspaper, describing their impressions of our army. It began by praising our army, saying that they were polite to visitors, had strict discipline, were heroic in spirit, and were absolutely fearless of death. They continued by saying that from Zhenru to Longhua to Nanshi, they did not encounter a single soldier who was hostile to foreigners. Although Japanese planes were dropping bombs everywhere, the morale of the Chinese army was neither chaotic nor panicked. They only hoped to continue shooting down Japanese planes. Soldiers surrounded and watched the bomb craters on the ground as if they were invisible.</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting Last Night: Japanese Army Advances on Qiujiang Road, Repulsed by Us by Midnight. Last night, the Japanese soldiers on Xinmin Road in Zhabei suddenly attacked our army around 7 p.m. The Japanese artillery also moved its artillery positions to bombard that area. Our troops calmly fought back head-on. The Japanese soldiers repeatedly charged towards the railway station, but were repelled by our machine guns. Our troops then advanced and engaged in street fighting at the entrance of Fusheng Road for about 25 minutes. The sound of gunfire was as dense as a string of pearls. Stray Japanese bullets reached Haining Road. Before long, the Japanese soldiers were forced to retreat completely due to the pressure of our artillery fire, heading north of North Sichuan Road. However, the sound of artillery fire continued unabated until about 9 p.m. The Japanese soldiers then gathered their remaining forces and advanced on Dadeli, Chuangong Road, Guangdong Street, and Qiujiang Road. Our troops immediately fought back in those two locations. The sound of machine guns sweeping back and forth was continuous, interspersed with the sounds of Mauser pistols, mortars, and rifles, which were very clear. The standoff lasted until midnight, when the Japanese soldiers finally retreated, unable to hold on. Stray bullets reached the Shenjiawan Fire Brigade in Hongkou. However, the Japanese artillery fire continued unabated. Our troops also retaliated with artillery, but the sound of gunfire was sparse. In these two street battles, our troops suffered minimal casualties, while the Japanese soldiers suffered heavy losses.</p>
<p>Municipal Government Notice to Consuls of Various Countries: Japanese Army Uses Concessions as Base of Operations; Our Government Will Not Be Responsible for Any Damage to Foreign Lives and Property Thereafter.</p>
<p>To whom it may concern: Regarding the matter of the Concession authorities allowing or failing to prevent the Japanese army from using the Concession area as a base for attacking the Chinese army, this Mayor has lodged a serious protest with the Public Concession's Bureau of Works, and declared that all responsibility arising therefrom shall be borne by the Concession authorities. However, although the Concession authorities are well aware that the aforementioned actions of the Japanese army are sufficient to undermine the neutrality of the Concession and endanger the lives and property of our people, they have not yet taken any effective measures to stop them. This Mayor has no choice but to request your Consul-General and the Consuls-General of other countries to strictly order the Bureau of Works to immediately take effective measures to stop the aforementioned actions of the Japanese army. At the same time, it is solemnly declared that if our army, for the sake of self-defense, attacks the Japanese army using the Concession as a base of operations, our Government will not be responsible for any damage to the lives and property of foreign nationals. In addition to sending separate letters, this letter is sent accordingly for your reference.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>To the Consuls-General of all countries stationed in Shanghai.</p>
<p>One Japanese Warship Grounded and Damaged During the Great Battle of Wusong Yesterday: Using Merchant Ships for Cover, Keel Sunk in Mud and Sand. Because the Japanese army failed in the battle of Zhabei, the newly appointed naval commander, Mr. Nomura, came to Shanghai and changed his strategy. For days, he has been exhausting the full strength of his naval, land, and air forces to fiercely attack our Wusong fort, hoping to occupy it. After our troops calmly fought back, the Japanese army still could not succeed. Yesterday, the Japanese army launched another large-scale offensive in the Wusong area and was again defeated by our troops, and one Japanese warship was also grounded and damaged. The accurate news obtained by this reporter is recorded separately below.</p>
<p>British Ship Enters at Risk: The Shanghai-Ningbo liner Xin Beijing of the British Taikoo Company arrived in Shanghai from Ningbo yesterday. As it approached Wusong in the morning, fighting had already broken out. The ship was blocked by artillery fire and could not enter the Huangpu River. It anchored outside the fire line at the Wusong Estuary. By noon, the artillery fire on both sides had not stopped. The Xin Beijing then requested a British warship anchored at the Wusong Estuary to protect its passage. The British warship then raised a flag, notifying both sides to temporarily cease fire to allow the merchant ship to enter. Out of respect for humanity and concern for civilian lives, our fort first stopped firing. The Japanese warship, in view of the escort of the British warship, did not dare to fire either. This was around 11 a.m. The foreign ships, including Xin Beijing, which had been blocked at the Wusong Estuary, then risked sailing into the Huangpu River. Unexpectedly, as soon as the merchant ships entered, the Japanese warship resumed its heavy bombardment of our fort.</p>
<p>Japanese Warship Sneaks into Wusong: The Japanese warships outside the Wusong Estuary have been unable to attack our fort since being blocked by warships from the United Kingdom and the United States. The Japanese warship that attacked our fort yesterday was one that sailed from Shanghai. Therefore, the Japanese warships firing were all inside Wusong. Yesterday afternoon, when the ships including Xin Beijing sailed from outside Wusong into the Huangpu River, a Japanese warship anchored at Sanjia Water actually joined the ships and secretly sailed into Wusong. As it approached the fort, the Japanese warship fired several shots at our fort. Our side did not retaliate for fear of harming the merchant ships. The foreign crew members on the accompanying ships believed that the Japanese warship's act of using merchant ships as cover to secretly attack the fort was an extremely despicable tactic.</p>
<p>Enemy Warship Grounded and Damaged: According to personnel on the Xin Beijing, after the ship sailed into Wusong, fierce artillery fire broke out again on both sides. A Japanese warship fighting inside Wusong was nearly hit in the stern by a cannon shot from the fort. The Japanese warship hurriedly tried to escape, but was grounded on a shallow beach on the riverbank. Its keel sank into the sand and it could no longer move. This was witnessed by people on the Xin Beijing. The warship appeared to be damaged. After that warship was damaged and grounded, many other Japanese warships fled south in panic. Their destination is unknown.</p>
<p>Heavy Japanese Casualties: A friend from the shipping industry, Mr. Zhang, came to Shanghai from Wusong yesterday. He reported to this reporter what he had witnessed. He passed through the Yunzaobang area, where there was a wooden bridge that had been destroyed by our troops to stop the Japanese army from advancing. Yesterday, the Japanese army's construction team transported a large amount of wood to that location to build a pontoon bridge, intending to launch an attack. However, the Japanese soldiers building the bridge were all shot dead by our troops, and they no longer dared to continue building the bridge. At Zhanghuabang and Yunzaobang, our troops were entrenched in trenches. The attacking Japanese soldiers could not cross these trenches. Yesterday, many Japanese soldiers were shot dead by our troops with rifles and machine guns near the trenches.</p>
<p>Japanese Ships Requisitioned for Transport: The Shanghai Maru and Nagasaki Maru, two merchant ships belonging to the Japanese Post Office in this port, have been requisitioned by the Japanese authorities for military use. Because of their high speed, these two ships have been converted into transport ships, traveling daily between China and Japan. Yesterday, the Nagasaki Maru arrived in Shanghai again, bringing military supplies and provisions from the East and moored at the Huishan Wharf. In addition, the Changjiang ships of the Japanese Qing Company have also been converted for military use in recent days. The "Maru" character has been removed from the names of the ships to disguise them as Chinese ships. When the Yiyang Maru arrived yesterday, the "Maru" character was also removed. When traveling along the Yangtze River, Chinese citizens should pay attention.</p>
<p>Merchant Ships Did Not Depart Yesterday: Because of the renewed fighting at Wusong yesterday, Chinese and foreign merchant ships that were scheduled to sail to Ningbo temporarily suspended their departure to prevent danger. Other foreign ships to the Yangtze River and the northern and southern seas also suspended their voyages. Maritime traffic has been interrupted again.</p>
<p>Japanese Warship Traffic Report: Regarding Japanese warships traveling to and from Shanghai yesterday, it was found that one torpedo boat from the Second Fleet and one gunboat sailed in from Wusong and moored at the Mitsubishi Wharf. Also, one torpedo boat each from the Twenty-Sixth and Thirtieth Fleets sailed into the Huangpu River from Wusong at 12:15 p.m. and sailed out again at 2:50 p.m. Their destination is unknown. In the afternoon, there was also a Japanese military barge, fully loaded with Japanese soldiers, sailing to Wusong. Furthermore, the British destroyer HMS Thanet also sailed to Wusong yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>Feng Yuxiang, Li Jishen, and Zhu Peide Send Telegram to Sun Ke and Others: Request to Make the Greatest Determination to Seek Long-Term Resistance.</p>
<p>A telegram from Feng Yuxiang, Li Jishen, and Zhu Peide to the Shanghai-based Central Committee member Sun Ke and others reads: (The titles are omitted) "The violent Japanese have not only occupied the Northeast but also wreaked havoc in Shanghai. On the 30th of last month, Central Committee members convened an emergency meeting and unanimously decided to make the greatest determination to seek long-term resistance and immediately move the Central Government to Luoyang to prevent the violent Japanese from implementing their gunboat policy. At the same time, a central hub will be established in the Central Plains to coordinate all forces and unite the country to seek a final victory. In the winter, the Central Party Headquarters held its eleventh meeting in Luoyang. Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, and all affiliated agencies and officials will suspend their salaries during the national crisis and only receive living expenses. From specially appointed officials to employees, the highest amount will be no more than 80 yuan per month, and the lowest amount will be 35 yuan. Only with a spirit of hard work and a determination to persevere can we live up to the greatest significance of moving the office location. Regarding the policy toward Japan, military and diplomatic measures will be implemented simultaneously. Only with a determination and methods for active military resistance can diplomacy proceed. The soldiers of the 19th Route Army are demonstrating their loyalty and courage in fighting the enemy to the death, boosting morale at home and enhancing national prestige abroad. The Central Committee members are deeply gratified and are actively planning to ensure that they do not fall into a situation of being an isolated and unsupported army. In short, we are fighting for legitimate self-defense and should exhaust the strength of all armed comrades to be the vanguard of the nation. Even if there is only one bullet and one soldier left, we will not lightly surrender an inch of land to the enemy. This is the determination that we should have in resisting Japan and is also our only obligation. Yuxiang and others are in the military ranks and are members of the Central Committee. We participated in the final deliberations on this major decision and vow to devote our efforts to share the hardships. Our brothers are the center of the Party and the country, and the hope of the people rests on you. Except for those with special missions, it seems appropriate to accompany us to the new capital to overcome the difficulties and set an example for other comrades. This is the most urgent request at the moment. We respectfully submit this telegram, hoping that you will consider it. We are deeply grateful.</p>
<p>Feng Yuxiang, Li Jishen, Zhu Peide, Sun Ke, etc.</p>
<p>The 19th Route Army Is Fighting on Behalf of the Entire Nation, Deeply Appreciating All Kinds of Assistance from All Sectors.</p>
<p>The Shanghai office of the 19th Route Army held a reception for the press at the Cangzhou Hotel yesterday afternoon. More than 20 reporters from various newspapers and news agencies attended. Propaganda directors Wang Zhiyuan and Deng Ruiren reported that this battle with the violent Japanese was entirely an act of self-defense, fulfilling the responsibility of our soldiers to defend our territory. The 19th Route Army is fighting on behalf of the entire nation of the Republic of China, not representing any faction or system. We are grateful for the comfort and various material assistance provided by various public groups, which will inspire the soldiers at the front to work harder, sharpen their spirits, and strive to resist. On behalf of all the officers and soldiers of the 19th Route Army, we express our gratitude to all sectors. Representatives of the press then delivered a response. The reception ended at 3:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Song's Telegram Requests All Provinces to Stop Borrowing National Taxes and Remit All Funds to the Ministry on Schedule.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Song Ziwen sent a telegram to the military and political authorities of all provinces on the 7th, stating: "Most Urgent. Chairman Gu of Zhenjiang, Chairman He of Wuchang, Chairman He of Changsha, Chairman Lu of Hangzhou, Chairman Chen of Anqing, Chairman Xiong of Nanchang, Chairman Han of Jinan, Chairman Fang of Fuzhou, Chairman Liu of Kaifeng, and all provincial governments, Pacification Commissioners, Commanders-in-Chief, Army Commanders, Division Commanders, and Brigade Commanders, please be advised that during the tenure of former Minister Huang, military expenses were lacking, and the National Government had no choice but to order all provinces to provide military and political expenses locally and remit funds to the Central Government. However, since the outbreak of the war in Shanghai, the national situation has become as precarious as a pile of eggs. Ziwen has been ordered to take over the Ministry of Finance during this time of crisis. Although he knows that the financial situation is difficult and has reached a dead end, he cannot refuse to resign in the face of difficulties, considering that our armed comrades are fighting bravely to defend the country. Therefore, he immediately took office, followed our armed comrades to serve the country with his own life, and ordered all financial personnel during Ziwen's tenure to resume their duties to become familiar with the work and achieve effective control. He also telegraphed all provinces and armies to stop borrowing national taxes and, on the 20th of last month, requested that the National Government issue a clear order that all national tax revenues should be remitted to the Ministry on schedule and should not be intercepted by local troops or directly used to achieve comprehensive planning. The military expenses of the various armies are not concerned about the lack of uniformity. At this time of national crisis, we dare not refuse any sacrifice, but only work together with one heart and one mind to defend against the great difficulties. If the provinces and armies automatically withdraw funds from their places of residence, it will be unfair. This is not the principle of mutual assistance and common support among our armed comrades for the various friendly armies. It is even more insufficient to express the spirit of national unity. From this day forward, Ziwen ordered personnel from various national tax agencies to return to their posts. From this day forward, all revenues will be transferred to the Military Supply Department for collection after remittance to the Ministry, so that the department can have an average allocation for the various armies. It is concerned with consolidating the source of funds and hitting the fate of survival...I implore all provinces and our armed comrades to maintain this method to save the fate of our nation. I respectfully hope that you will understand."</p>
<p>Song Ziwen, Koutang.</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Writes to the Bureau of Works Requesting the Receipt of Japanese Military Defense, Refuting Improper Excuses for Japanese Responsibility</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce wrote to the Public Concession Bureau of Works yesterday, saying: "To Whom It May Concern: This time, the Japanese army has provoked incidents in Zhabei, using the Public Concession as a base of operations, which the Bureau has not stopped, leading to a tragic situation in Shanghai that has never occurred since the opening of trade. It is truly regrettable. The Public Concession is not exclusively controlled by one country, so its responsibilities are joint. Japan has the responsibility not to violate neutrality, and the various countries also have the responsibility not to sit idly by while it violates neutrality and fail to stop it. Previously, we saw the Bureau's reply to Mayor Wu, attributing the responsibility to Japan alone. This kind of argument cannot be agreed to in principle. What our association wants to discuss is that the roads built by the Bureau outside the Concession, such as Jiangwan Road, etc., have been requested for the Japanese army to gather in large numbers and set up command headquarters. Among them, the target range on that road is particularly high and can be used as an artillery position to prolong the war. The harm to Chinese and foreign businessmen is by no means insignificant. Our association believes that the international troops have now arrived one after another, with strong strength. The Bureau wants to maintain its long-standing dignity and position and recover the power trampled by the Japanese army, and this is the time. It should request that all the places where the Bureau builds roads outside the concession, such as Jiangwan Road and Diswei Road, be temporarily taken over by the international troops who have recently arrived in Shanghai to protect peace. This is the fundamental purpose of the various friendly countries sending troops to Shanghai."</p>
<p>Japanese Airplanes Fly in the Concession: The Bureau of Works Asks the Leading Consul to Prevent Our Army from Considering the Safety of the British and French Concessions.</p>
<p>The Chairman of the Bureau of Works, Mr. McKelvie, wrote to the American Consul General and Leading Consul, Mr. Cunningham, on the 6th of this month: "To Whom It May Concern: It is extremely dangerous for military aircraft and reconnaissance and training aircraft to fly in the sky above this Concession. During this period, not only does it cause panic among the general residents, but also the guns and shells attracted by the aircraft have fallen in large numbers in this Concession, where the population is dense and refugees are crowded. The lives and property of the residents are in great danger. In the event that bombs fall from the aircraft, or the aircraft carrying bombs crash due to damage, the consequences would be unimaginable. Japanese aircraft have been flying over the Concession frequently in the past week, and repeated representations have been made to the Japanese authorities, but they have not stopped. We hereby request your Consul General to make earnest representations to the Japanese and Chinese authorities again to avoid any actions that endanger the lives and property of the residents of the Concession."</p>
<p>The Chinese Air Force Commander has long ordered all pilots not to fly over the Public Concession and the French Concession and not to engage in combat with enemy aircraft in the skies of the two Concessions.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu's Speech at the Municipal Government Memorial Week</p>
<p>At 9 a.m. yesterday, the Municipal Government held a Memorial Week ceremony presided over by Mayor Wu. After the usual rites, Mayor Wu gave an important report to all employees. The record of his speech is as follows:</p>
<p>Last week, the United States initiated a joint communication to China and Japan by the United Kingdom, France, and Italy, with five proposed methods for reconciling the Sino-Japanese dispute. China has generally accepted them (i.e., requesting that the neutral zone be changed to a peace zone and neutral countries to third countries). However, Japan only agreed to the first, third, and fourth items and disagreed with the second and fifth items, which are the most important. Although the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Italy are trending towards making new protests to Japan, it can prove that Japan has no sincerity. Its desire to vigorously implement a policy of military expansion, regardless of destroying world peace, is clearly visible. Since the September 18th Incident last year, our National Government has brought this case to the League of Nations and the countries presiding over justice to maintain world peace and respect international covenants, non-war pacts, and the Washington Nine-Power Treaty to promote Japan's awareness. However, Japan has been dealing with the League of Nations with an evasive and stubborn attitude. On the one hand, it has continued to send heavy troops south along the Yangtze River, attempting to occupy Shanghai. However, since the 28th night of last month, the Japanese army, navy, and air force have continued to attack us. Relying on the loyalty and courage of the officers and soldiers of our 19th Route Army, who have resisted resolutely with a determination to die, they have been able to prevent the Japanese army from realizing its ambitions and have suffered the greatest setbacks. This is not only sufficient to demonstrate the inherent spirit of peace and struggle of our nation and open up a new opportunity for China's future, but it can also arouse the sympathy and attention of the world's great powers. The mediation of the four countries is only the beginning of sympathy and attention, and shame and self-improvement will all be based on this. Secondly, since the outbreak of the war in this city, the financial revenue of the municipal treasury has plummeted, even to the point where there may be no revenue at all. Therefore, the temporary municipal meeting on the 4th decided to suspend the original salaries of all employees from the mayor downwards and pay each person a living allowance of 50 yuan per month. Although the front line relies on the officers and soldiers to resist the enemy, consolidating the rear relies on the assistance of government agency personnel and people from all walks of life. This is our best opportunity to serve the country. Therefore, even though only the minimum living expenses are issued, I believe that all colleagues will be able to work harder and serve diligently to strengthen the determination of the soldiers on the front line to resist the enemy. Then, even though all colleagues are in the rear, there is not much difference from the front line. I hope that all my colleagues will work together to this end.</p>
<p>British and American Troops on Defense Duty: The Continental News reports that the 31st Regiment of the U.S. Infantry, currently stationed at the New World, will join the defense duties of the Public Concession on Tuesday morning. In recent days, its commander, Colonel Gasai, has repeatedly met with Major General Fleming, Chairman of the Public Concession Defense Committee, and Colonel Hoke, Commander of the U.S. Marine Corps. The former defense area of the British Scottish Fusiliers has now been assigned to the U.S. Army for deployment. The northern boundary is the Suzhou Creek, the southern boundary is the French Concession, the eastern boundary is Henan Road, and the western boundary is Mahuo Road and Meibaike Road. The Da Wan Bao reports that the Second Battalion of the 31st Regiment of the U.S. Infantry will take over defense at 2 p.m. on Tuesday. Its commander, Colonel Gasai, was led by Commander Dodd of the British Scottish Fusiliers to inspect the defense area on Monday morning. The left side of its defense area is currently defended by the U.S. Marine Corps, from Meibaike Road to Hague Road. The right side, east of Henan Road, is defended by the American Chamber of Commerce, the Portuguese Company, and the American Company. When the Scottish Fusiliers are relieved of their defense duties, they will remain in the camp as reserves, waiting for the arrival of the British Wettersham camp to replace them. Furthermore, officers and soldiers of the Scottish Argyle Sutherland Regiment, which recently arrived in Shanghai, inspected the defense area of the U.S. Marine Corps this morning (the 8th). It is reported that although the team is staying in camp as a reserve, it is preparing to deploy outposts along the American sentry line in the flour mill area near Meigen Road.</p>
<p>American Nationals Determined Not to Leave Shanghai, Believing There Is No Danger: The Continental News reports that the U.S. Consulate General in Shanghai reiterated yesterday that there is currently no danger to American nationals in Shanghai. Therefore, there is no need to order American nationals to leave the country in the foreseeable future. American nationals will live in Shanghai indefinitely, and there is no reason to panic.</p>
<p>Telecommunications Still Working Normally Amidst Intense Fighting: The International Radio Station, Zilin Bao reports that Mr. Hicklin, the representative of the American Radio Telegraph Company in China, claimed yesterday (the 7th) that although Zhenru was bombarded by Japanese aircraft, the International Radio Station was not damaged. It was still sending telegrams in the afternoon of the 7th. The management of the lines and power supply was occasionally damaged last week, but it has been repaired. During the repairs, temporary emergency generators were prepared, and they were able to cope with overseas telegrams very well. The Zhenru Radio Station and the ground have not been damaged at all. It is believed that both sides do not want to damage radio communications.</p>
<p>The Great Northern Telegraph: The Japanese army launched a large-scale attack on the Wusong Fort last night but failed to succeed. They then transported 30 truckloads of marines to Wusong, expecting to launch a more violent attack sooner or later. Yesterday, the Japanese army landed at Zhanghuabang and launched an offensive. Near that location, there is a telegraph station of the Great Northern Telegraph Company. The Shanghai landline is connected to the submarine cable to Hong Kong at that location. During the fierce fighting yesterday, the company's chief engineer, Mr. Kirkimo, and deputy engineer Mr. and Mrs. Anderson and staff remained in the station to protect this important communication line and the valuable materials stored there. The Great Northern Telegraph Company has prepared a small wheel moored in front of the station for Mr. Kirk and others to take in case of danger, but they are unwilling to leave their posts. During the last Wusong war, the submarine cables of the Great Eastern and Pacific Commercial Telegraph Company were interrupted due to the earthquake. Now, all overseas telegrams rely on the Great Northern Telegraph, so the loyalty and service of Mr. Kirk and others are invaluable.</p>
<p>Execution of a Han Traitor for Throwing Grenades: Announcement of Ma Genlin's Crimes.</p>
<p>On the 2nd of this month, a criminal named Ma Genlin was arrested in front of the Guangfu Temple in the city for throwing grenades and disrupting public order. Ma Genlin, from Wuxian County, 34 years old, was sent to the City Public Security Bureau by Yi Xuren, the director of the Second Sub-district of the First District, for interrogation. He confessed to the crime. It has been presented to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters and sentenced to death. The bureau, at 2 p.m. yesterday (the 8th), verified the identity of the criminal Ma Genlin, escorted him to the Chen Yingshi Memorial Tower on Fangbang Bridge in Ximen, and executed him by firing squad. A notice was posted on the tower, announcing Ma's crimes. The corpse was then coffined and buried by the Tongren Fuyuan Hall.</p>
<p>Ningbo Fellow Townsmen Propose Measures to Punish Traitors</p>
<p>Zhuang Gao, Xu Chengyi, Zhang Bosuo, Zhou Zhiheng, and 152 other fellow townsmen from Ningbo in Shanghai jointly sent a letter to the Ningbo Fellow Townsmen Association in Shanghai, outlining measures to punish traitors. The letter stated: "Since the violent Japanese invaded Shanghai, they have been destructive in every way. When the people bravely resisted, everyone was filled with indignation. At this time, when the 19th Route Army is bravely resisting, some fellow countrymen from Jiangbei have been induced by the Japanese with money to act as guides, throwing grenades to disrupt the rear. There is no greater example of being blinded by greed. Moreover, we have heard that some fellow townsmen from Ningbo have also been induced to participate. The Ningbo fellow townsmen in Shanghai account for one-third of all of Shanghai, and there may be both good and bad among them, but we must pay attention. Therefore, we offer our views for your consideration: (1) Send a letter to the Jiangbei Fellow Townsmen Association or Jiangbei leaders, asking them to find ways to stop it. (2) If there are indeed unscrupulous elements among the fellow townsmen who are being used by the Japanese, the association should conduct strict investigations and issue public warnings. (3) If there are such unscrupulous elements among the relatives and friends of the fellow townsmen, they should be persuaded. If they do not listen to advice, report them to the authorities or the association for disposal. (4) For those who report the actions of such unscrupulous elements to the association and have conclusive evidence, the association will award a reward at its discretion. (5) Once the actions of these unscrupulous elements have been verified, in addition to being sent to the authorities for investigation, their photos can be displayed to the public, and they can be expelled from their clans to serve as a warning to others. (6) If their relatives, siblings, and friends know about it and conceal it, they can be subject to the same punishment. The above articles should be dealt with urgently by the association together with the Jiangbei Fellow Townsmen Association." It is reported that after receiving the letter, the association has scheduled a meeting at 3 p.m. on the 9th of this month to discuss ways to stop it.</p>
<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Thoroughly Investigates the Private Transportation of Japanese Coal</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce discovered that the Inland River Merchants Steamship Bureau was purchasing Japanese coal from Mitsui &amp; Co. at the Suzhou Creek Wharf. They immediately dispatched personnel, along with Wang Wenzheng and Xie Baoxing, two staff members from the Coal Industry Association, to investigate. As expected, there was a barge belonging to Mitsui &amp; Co. moored in front of the bureau's wharf, with the Mitsui &amp; Co. logo on both sides of the stern. When Zhang Zhengpei, the comprador of the bureau, was repeatedly questioned, he finally said that the 43 tons of Japanese coal were indeed purchased by the bureau. Because the Municipal Chamber of Commerce had conclusive evidence of the private transportation of Japanese coal, it has reportedly sent a letter to the Coal Industry and Inland River Shipping Associations for thorough investigation and also sent a letter to the Inland River Merchants Steamship Bureau, urging it to dismiss and investigate the responsible personnel to appease public anger.</p>
<p>Friends and Relatives Can Inquire About Missing Persons at the Police Station</p>
<p>The Public Concession Bureau of Works Information Office announced that anyone with missing friends and relatives can inquire at Room 328 on the third floor of the Public Concession General Patrol Room.</p>
<p>Taxpayers' Association Writes to the Bureau of Works to Stop the Japanese Army from Torturing Chinese Citizens Extrajudicially</p>
<p>The Shanghai Concession Taxpayers' Association wrote to the Bureau of Works yesterday: "To Whom It May Concern: According to a letter from the manager of Dunxu Bank, at around 12:30 p.m. yesterday, while I was working with my colleagues in the bank, the Japanese army and plainclothes officers stationed at the corner of Tiantong Road and Zhaopu Road suddenly fired dozens of shots at our bank building, with bullets raining down. I didn't know the reason, so I led the staff to leave temporarily. I also learned that the reason for the Japanese army's shooting was because a clerk from the Hua Tea Company living on the fourth floor threw tea dregs on the heads of the Japanese. After the shooting stopped, I went back to the bank to relock the doors and warehouses and arranged for a resident manager to stay in the bank. At around 1:10 p.m., I led seven or eight staff members out through the side door, but was stopped by the Japanese army. After I negotiated with the plainclothes Japanese in English, they sent a Japanese junior officer to conduct a full body search of us for about</p>

<p>Guangdong Planes to Fly North Soon (Nanjing) Zhang Huichang telegraphed Huang Bingheng, stating that some of the Guangdong planes could be transferred to the north to assist in defense. Huang has replied with a welcome. The Guangdong planes will arrive north soon. (8th Dispatch) (Nanjing) He Yingqin used the 6th and 7th Aviation Squadrons to bravely resist the Japanese planes' attacks, fighting against overwhelming odds and shooting down Japanese planes. He telegraphed Huang Bingheng on the 6th, ordering a general commendation. (8th Central News Agency Dispatch) Japanese Military Plane Crash Near Nagoya (Tokyo) Today, two military planes crashed near Nagoya, completely destroying the aircraft. Three officers and one sergeant died. (8th Reuters Dispatch) Britain Remains Silent on Japan's Troop Dispatch Statement (London) Today, political circles have no comment on the Japanese government's statement. There is also no news on when the four powers will respond to Japan. (8th Reuters Dispatch) London The Japanese embassy has published the full text of the Japanese explanation for dispatching troops to Shanghai. (7th Havas Dispatch) Japan Declares No Infringement on British Interests (Tokyo) Because the London Times editorial mentioned Japan's intention to establish a puppet government in Shanghai, today the Foreign Ministry spokesman declared that Britain can rest assured. Japan has no political ambitions in mainland China. The Times' statement is completely unfounded. The claim that Japan is approaching the Chinese authorities to obtain special interests in the Yangtze River is also absurd.

(8th Dispatch) Amidst the Rampant Aggression of Japanese Troops, the Powers Extravagantly Discuss Disarmament The French Premier Explains the Disarmament Proposal, Saying That Even If a Country Is Invaded and Wins the War, It Still Cannot Forget (Geneva) At a time when the sound of gunfire is loud in a corner of Shanghai, and Chinese and Japanese troops are fighting without a declaration of war, the World's First Disarmament Conference was held in Geneva this morning at 10 o'clock. The British representative Simon claimed that Britain is in favor of completing the abolition of submarines, prohibiting the use of poison gas and chemicals, and reducing the number and tonnage of warships and the caliber of artillery. Simon also urged the Disarmament Conference to maintain the Washington Treaty and the London Naval Treaty, and said that Britain, in principle, supports the prohibition of certain calibers of artillery and the agreement on the number of standing armies that any country can maintain, in order to limit conscription. Simon said during his speech that while Geneva is discussing disarmament, armaments are being used in the Far East, bombs are being dropped from the sky, and troops are being mobilized. The spirit of the League of Nations Charter has been lost, which can be said to be extremely contradictory. However, I do not think that the situation in the Far East will make this meeting untimely. Rather, this fact shows that our work needs to be accelerated. The French representative Tardieu continued Simon's speech, saying that the French disarmament theory is based on the Treaty of Versailles and the League of Nations Charter. France has four conditions for reducing armaments: (1) security; (2) fulfillment of treaty obligations; (3) consideration of geographical location; (4) special circumstances. (8th National Dispatch) (Geneva) The Disarmament Conference now solely absorbs public attention, while the Manchurian and Shanghai incidents have almost been neglected. The French disarmament proposal is still being actively discussed as information by all parties. It is generally felt that this proposal needs to be greatly revised before it can be accepted by various countries. Therefore, the speeches of the British representative Simon and the French representative Tardieu tomorrow will be valued by all parties, especially the remarks of British Foreign Secretary Simon, because tomorrow's speeches may make people clearer and indicate the trend of the Disarmament Conference. (8th Reuters Dispatch) (Geneva) The French representative Tardieu explained the French proposal submitted last Friday at the Disarmament Conference today. He first said that today, a psychology of distrust permeates the earth, and the sound of war, which the world is tired of hearing, is resounding. The Disarmament Conference is being held at this time, and the importance of its responsibility can be imagined. What the world is suffering from today, in addition to the chaos of order, also includes the difficulties of banks, the panic of industry and commerce, and the economy. In short, thirteen years have passed since the establishment of the League of Nations Covenant, but we have not enjoyed its actual benefits at all. However, although the provisions of the League of Nations Covenant are to end the past, they also anticipate the future. For example, the Covenant stipulates that all treaty obligations should be strictly respected, and the most important thing is to maintain the territorial integrity and political independence of all member states so that they are not subject to external aggression. Therefore, all countries that signed the Covenant have a common obligation, which is to build peace and reduce armaments. However, since the implementation of the Covenant, we have repeatedly gathered for disarmament matters without any results. The people of the world can no longer tolerate this, and they have shouted loudly, saying that no matter what kind of promise, no matter how long or short, we only ask that it be effective and able to realize compulsory arbitration and conciliation procedures, and we will support it. Therefore, our current goal is only to build on the basis of the Covenant, and not to seek another foundation. It is not that we do not have the idea of ​​reducing armaments, but even if we have this idea and lack the power to implement it, those who are enthusiastic about this path will also be disheartened. Article 8 of the Covenant contains all public safety and arms limitation procedures, but the interpretations are different. Some people think that this is just a means of changing with the situation, while others think that Article 8 is a kind of lasting new power, which can be used to maintain peace and security and reduce armaments. Our thinking belongs to the latter. Among these two kinds of thinking, what to choose depends on the choices of each country. The spirit of the French proposal lies in this. France is prepared to make a treaty to unconditionally limit its armaments within a certain period, but if the League of Nations cannot be strengthened, peace will not be guaranteed for a day, because the League of Nations is the only power to prevent and punish war. All the French people are united behind their government, and the French farmers in particular want their land to be protected, because the tragedy of territorial invasion is something that the French people cannot forget even after winning the war. Tardieu's conclusion was particularly moving, generally saying that mankind has long yearned for peace. If disarmament fails, mankind's disappointment will be indescribable. Moreover, disarmament is the most obvious responsibility entrusted to us by the Covenant, and it can be fully realized. If we do not succeed in this, our career is equivalent to bankruptcy. The world we live in should endure sacrifices, and the unfinished ambitions of our predecessors should be continued by us.

<h3 id="e2">How to Properly Care for the Families of Martyrs <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>For the past twenty years, our nation has been in a state of war and turmoil almost daily. Each war has resulted in splatters of crimson blood and piles of white bones, building new "heroes" and "chieftains" onto the "throne of divine might," and adorning a new "crown of victory." In other words, it is "one general achieving fame upon ten thousand withered bones." The successful ones are a few ambitious individuals, while the sacrificed are countless common people forced by life to make dying for war their profession. This kind of war is the rotting agent of our nation, and this kind of sacrifice is especially just being used as a tool for individuals, with no meaning or value.</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident erupted last year, Japanese imperialists have directly coerced our nation with violence, slaughtering our people. Their cruelty and brutality are those of demons persecuting all of humanity. In order to strive for the survival and freedom of our nation and country, and to uphold justice and righteousness, the brave warriors of our nation, such as the troops of Ma Zhanshan who bitterly fought the tyrannical army in Longjiang, the recent troops of Li Du and Ding Chao, the volunteer armies in various parts of the Northeast, and the 19th Route Army who bravely resisted the violence in Shanghai this time, their bitter fighting and their sacrifices truly have great value, enough to move heaven and earth and make ghosts and spirits weep. For the meaning of this battle is truly a revolutionary war against Japanese imperialism, and the sacrifices of this battle are truly heroic martyrs who are defending our nation and country. In history, they possess greatness and glory that can never be erased. We should not only express warm sympathy and sincere admiration for the heroic soldiers who sacrificed themselves in this great war to defend the survival of our nation. What is especially important is that we should provide active and effective relief and aftercare for the families of the martyrs.</p>
<p>We believe that the government should make a comprehensive and concrete plan for this kind of work, such as providing compensation to the families of the martyrs, such as opening schools for the dependents of the martyrs (different in meaning from the existing schools for the dependents of the martyrs in Nanjing), such as allocating a fixed fund for compensating the families of the martyrs. For the disabled soldiers, setting up shelters, or factories, or a fixed compensation fund, are all matters that cannot be delayed. As for our people, we should also tighten our belts and contribute to this meaningful cause. Only in this way can the families of the deceased martyrs not be displaced. Only in this way can the brave soldiers bear their responsibilities and risk their lives to rush to the front lines.</p>

<p>Four enemy armored vehicles were destroyed in Wenzaobang, and an enemy military aircraft was shot down in Zhabei. The enemy's casualties in the two places were close to 2,000, which was the most intense battle since the start of the war. After the Japanese army changed its strategy, it poured all its strength of the navy, army, and air force to fiercely attack our Wusong. The general attack, after a day and night of fierce fighting the day before, had already been declared a failure. Yesterday morning at dawn, with its original forces and the addition of 6,000 infantry troops, it continued to order an attack on the front of our Wenzaobang, while at the same time dispatching a team to bypass Jijia Bridge, attempting to cross it secretly and cut off our retreat route. After our army bravely fought back, more than a thousand enemies were killed. The enemy on the front of Wenzaobang launched more than ten charges. Our army fought them in hand-to-hand combat, and the enemy suffered countless casualties. Now they are all surrounded by our army, and four of their armored vehicles have been destroyed. As for the Zhabei area, the area west of Baziqiao and Baoxing Road, the fighting was also extremely fierce. During the bloody battle on West Baoxing Road yesterday afternoon, our army feigned a retreat. After the enemy penetrated deep, the ambush troops rose up and killed more than seven hundred enemies. More than a dozen enemy planes were still dropping bombs in Wusong, Zhabei, and other places yesterday. At 3:00 PM, an enemy plane was shot down at the Sun Temple in Zhabei.

After a bloody battle of up to eight hours, the Japanese army suffered more than half casualties, suffered heavy losses, and finally could not support and retreated. Yesterday morning at dawn, the Japanese army continued to fiercely attack Wusong. In addition to the original forces, it also transferred most of the newly arrived infantry troops, about 6,000, to Wusong to fight. Both the navy and air force used cannons and heavy bombs, raining them down. On land, they relied on sharp weapons such as armored vehicles and tanks to charge more than ten times. However, our army waited at ease and was extremely calm, repelling them all. In a battle west of Zhujia浜, our army, with the arrival of reinforcements from Zhabei, attacked from both sides, killing more than a thousand enemies. The enemy was routed at the mere sight of our forces. Brave is our army, not ashamed to be good men of China. Now, the news of our army's victory in Wusong will be detailed below.</p>

<p>Report from our reporter stationed in Song</p>
<p>It is reported that the enemy used all its naval, land, and air forces to attack Wusong the day before yesterday. Our army fought bravely to resist, and the two sides fought fiercely for a day. The enemy was still unable to make progress. At around 9:00 PM the night before yesterday, more than 2,000 additional enemies arrived in Zhanghuabang to reinforce. At that time, the enemy forces had once occupied Wenzaobang Station, but were soon repelled by the cannons and machine guns架 set up on the roofs of the Yong'an and Huafeng yarn factories by our army. In this battle, the enemy suffered heavy casualties. Afterwards, although the enemy soldiers tried their best to attack, they were unable to make progress due to our army's fierce artillery fire. Therefore, at around 5:00 AM yesterday morning, the enemy dispatched about seven or eight hundred soldiers to detour through rural paths to Jijia Bridge (also known as Ruizhi Bridge), about three miles west of Wenzaobang (hoping to build a pontoon bridge there, secretly cross Wenzaobang and Sitang River, cut off our army's retreat route, and attack our army's flank. Unexpectedly, our army had been prepared for this. When the enemy was halfway across the river, our army immediately bravely took the lead and met them to attack. Countless enemy soldiers were killed and drowned by our army before they retreated in panic. Then, at around 10:00 AM, the enemy dispatched a large team to attack in that direction again. The two sides are now facing each other across the river.</p>

<p>The actual number of troops was more than 10,000. Just in terms of the troops attacking the corner of Wenzaobang, there were no less than 3,700 people.

Therefore, when continuing to attack Wusong yesterday, they made the most resolute decision and transferred most of the 6,000 newly arrived infantry troops from Japan to Wusong to fight. Their attack plan, in addition to warships and airplanes using heavy bombs and artillery fire, targeted the Wusong Pond, Wusong Fortress, Fortress Fortress, and Baoshan County City, constantly bombarding them, and also used 20,000 naval and land troops to attack us from the front, middle, rear, and both left and right flanks. According to British naval military experts, the Japanese army's battle yesterday used the dawn battle, with its front-line troops in Wenzaobang, the left wing deployed in Lujia宅, the right wing deployed in Jungong Road, and several guerrilla teams were also formed to coordinate. During the charge, the army was mostly guided by sharp weapons such as armored vehicles and tanks.</p>

<p>The Da Mei Evening News says today</p>
<p>(8th) (At dawn, the Japanese Marines, assisted by newly arrived infantry, launched a large-scale advance on Wenzaobang, hoping to capture the Wusong Fortress and Baoshan City. According to official Japanese sources at noon today, the Japanese army has reached Wenzaobang, but has been unable to advance due to the strong resistance of the Chinese army on the opposite bank. At present, the two sides are exchanging fire with machine guns and rifles, interspersed with the sound of field artillery and Japanese warships' artillery. This morning at 10:00, the spokesman for the Japanese Marines Headquarters on North Sichuan Road optimistically said that the Japanese commander expected to capture the fortress at noon, but in the afternoon, according to observers, the 19th Route Army held its position and was unstoppable, and the Japanese army made no progress. The Japanese army headquarters is now located in the factory on the Jinghu Road in the Wusong area, directing the battle on that road. At noon today, news also came out from the Japanese Consulate General that the Japanese army has not been able to launch a large-scale operation because the bridge over Wenzaobang has been broken and must wait for the pontoon bridge to be built before it can attack. It is heard that the fierce battle this morning caused many casualties on both sides. The Chinese army defended the advancing Japanese soldiers with rifles, machine guns, and hand grenades from the trenches, causing the Japanese soldiers to die in piles. Cargo trucks were sometimes used to carry corpses back to Yangshupu Road from the battlefield. As for the exact number, it could not be found out from the Japanese Marines Headquarters or the Japanese Consulate General. The Wusong Fortress, after five days of heavy bombardment, is still in the hands of the Chinese army at noon today. According to Chinese military sources, in this morning's battle, the disembarking Japanese reinforcements were severely wounded. The Chinese army ambushed in the trenches, waiting at ease, and was very confident. Since the start of the battle in the Wusong area, the Liping Road from Yangshupu to Wusong has been strictly guarded by Japanese sailors. No one is allowed to enter beyond the Pingliang Road intersecting Liping Road. There are wooden signs in Chinese and English at the intersection with the words "No Entry" written on them. Those who approach are chased away by Japanese sailors with guns.</p>
<h3 id="e13">The Battle of Jiangwan <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the enemy army transferred 4,000 infantry and marines to launch a fierce attack on Wusong from Jungong Road. After four failed charges, they were still in stalemate at Wenzaobang last night. The main force of the enemy army was concentrated in Zhanghuabang. Our army stationed in Jiangwan advanced with gags in their mouths last night, carrying out an encirclement of the Japanese army's rear. When the army reached the eastern section of Jiangwan Road, it encountered the enemy army, and immediately opened fire. When the reporter was drafting the manuscript, he heard that the two armies were still in fierce fighting.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Liuhhe Town Peaceful <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>In the Liuhhe area, due to the interruption of transportation after the firing in Wusong, the news was slow, resulting in rumors in Shanghai that the Japanese army had attacked Liuhhe. Yesterday, the reporter inquired from various parties. Yesterday afternoon, Mr. Xiang, a merchant from Liuhhe Town in this city, said that the recent rumors are not credible. Liuhhe Town is several miles away from the sea口, and since the September 18th Incident, heavy troops have been stationed there to defend the sea口, and the defense is strict. Moreover, there are natural barriers to defend there, and it is expected that the Japanese invaders will be defeated. He also said that we can rest easy.</p>
