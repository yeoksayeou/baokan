<h3 id="c1">如何安定川局　梓 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>本月一日順慶戰事發動以後。川亂局面。雖未見有如何之發展。而各方弭戰之進行。則較諸局中人之軍事行動。更爲緊張。此足見全國對於廢止内戰之努力也。吾人綜合各方之行動與言論。得安定川局之方案四種。（一）爲求維持發動前原狀者。如行政院之電令直接觸各方（劉文輝李家鈺羅澤洲）停止軍事行動。分勸劉湘鄧錫侯田頌堯楊森劉存厚從中調解。並準備派大員入川調停息爭是也。（二）爲欲重新分配川中軍人之利益以求息爭者。如所傳川軍師旅長百餘人提出治川綱要。主張打破防區制。財政公開等。及南京川軍各駐京代表之討論劃淸軍政職權。重行支配防地是也。（三）爲督促中央之嚴正處置者。如北方某報之主張［首須由中央各方面當軸與夫關係分子。自處超然地位。對川軍各派。一視同仁。以嚴正公道之態度。宣布辦法。飭二劉以次各將領遵辦。有不從者斷然處分之］是也。（四）爲主張民力制止者。如旅京川同鄉之提議喚起民衆爲有效制止是也。</p>
<p>吾人欲判定上述四種方案之效力。不得不略述川中羣雄角逐之實際情形。今日稱雄於四川一百二十九萬方里土地者。劉湘劉文輝田頌堯鄧錫侯楊森劉存厚。其數爲六。而羅澤洲李家鈺之徒不與焉。此六人者。劉文輝劉湘各擁衆十萬。田鄧各擁衆五萬。楊森劉存厚部卒亦自三萬以至萬人。川中土地雖廣。羣雄迫處。强者思吞有全省。弱者求因機取利。欲其不亂事本甚難。此次　端之開。表面爲羅李得劉湘援助。與劉文輝部爭防接觸。實則田鄧二人。大有關係。楊森劉存厚。亦非完全旁觀。此爲一般人所大致明瞭者。依此事實。則行政院之措。置其難有效昭然若揭。重新分配利益。其爲不易。尤無待言。督促政府之輿論。恐亦未必爲各將領所重視。希望民力之制裁。則二十一年來受四百六十七次戰爭痛苦之人民。亦斷乎一時無力負此重任。此川局安定問題之所以成爲今日無法籌議之難題。而在京川籍大員之所以不敢受入川調停之使命也。</p>
<p>民國以來。中央政府控制川局之計劃。第一次失敗於陳宦之統軍深入。第二次失敗於吳佩孚之利用楊森。而他省人之欲得川省者。自戴戡傷身以後。亦無人敢於一試。在此種環境之下川局安定問題。事實上暫時只能讓川人自負其責。［天下未亂蜀先亂。天下已定蜀後定。］全國政治若無辦法。空言定川。殊難收效。全國其他部分。若能先行安定。則夔門以内之安定。亦自易於着手。吾人非不希望川局之得有解决。特其解决不能先於各省。此今日努力於安定川局問題者。所應知也。</p>

<p>哈瓦斯社十六日莫斯科電　蘇聯政府公報［伊士凡斯太］今日於社論中、述及蘇聯與羅馬尼亞議訂之互不侵犯條約、經多時談判、因羅馬尼亞之阻撓政策、迄無所成、指羅國政府爲對和平怠工、據云、蘇聯値此遠東局勢嚴重之際、無時不以和平爲念、故以非常之鎭靜態度、推進其和平政策、使最兇狂之武力主義者、亦不得不暫時放棄其對於和平之游戲態度蘇聯已與芬闌·拉特維亞·波蘭及愛沙尼亞·接連簽訂不侵犯條約·因此種和平政策之成功、甚佳在反蘇聯勢力猖狂之法國、亦有於半推半就中、接受蘇聯和平提議之傾向、羅馬尼亞爲蘇聯隣國中唯一拒絕訂約之國家、該國當局雖因蘇聯和平政策之勝利、不能過分拒絕蘇聯對於訂約之提議、惟在一年來之交涉中、羅國曾以各種藉口、將接近成功之條約推翻、故目前蘇聯將期待羅馬尼亞確切之答復、即願與其他樂愛和平之東歐國家同樣、與蘇聯訂不侵犯條約、抑從國際内某種份子之願望、堅持其破壞和平之政策云、</p>
<p>塔斯社十六日莫斯科電　今日蘇聯報載外長李維諾夫關於締結俄羅不侵犯條約之談話、李氏首述談判之經過歷史、指羅馬尼亞曾二度派遣代表簽字於草約、而二度自己破壤之、故謂羅馬尼亞加確願與蘇聯締結不侵犯條約、而不圖從中達到他種間接目的者、則條約早可成立矣、李氏稱、羅馬尼亞之反覆行爲、顯示其國内外必有多種勢力在互鬥中、且羅馬尼亞究有締約之誠意與否、亦殊可疑因其負責之代表亦謂此種條約、對羅馬尼亞不甚需要也、羅馬尼亞代表於長時間討論成立之條欵、常臨時要求取去易以新條欵、其意顯然欲引起新爭點、延長談判式簽字之期、或竟破壞之、惟蘇聯對訂約之誠意、則始終如一、李氏對羅馬尼亞提議召集蘇聯邊境國家、訂一多方面之條約、認爲無用以爲蘇聯政府所欲訂立者、乃兩對方之條約、蓋事實已昭然者、凱洛格公約對中日兩簽字國之武力衝突、完全無力制止、故蘇聯對其本身與他國進行之鄭重條約、殊不欲使之變爲同樣外交上之游戲也云</p>
<p>國民社十五日羅京電　羅馬尼亞外長鐡士萊斯科回京以後、政局仍未能消弛緊張、且鐡氏與首相威達間、裂痕益深縱以國王喀羅爾力圖彌縫、曾無顯效、聞鐡氏仍反對與蘇俄締不侵犯條約、而威達則力持與莫斯科繼續直接談判、閣員中有數人贊助鐡氏主張、要求將向來唯法人馬首是從之外交政策加以改變、接近鐡氏者並謂法人最近更欲利用國聯借欵、加緊其施於羅國外交上之覊勒、不得不早謀自處云</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社十六日羅京電　本日慶祝國王壽誕、國家農民黨首領馬尼予、與總理威達及外長鐡土萊斯科會晤、威氏與鐡氏均完全堅持原來意見、故兩人之調和似已無望、内務部長米哈拉什前有贊成鐡氏意見之消息、說者深恐因此引起國家農民黨内部之分裂、此事目下似已避免、而威達氏地位在與蘇俄互不侵犯條約重行談判以前、已臻鞏固云又訊明日將有兩次談話、結局國王或親自參加、　　哈瓦斯社十六日莫斯科電　塔斯通信社曾爲羅馬尼亞與蘇聯商訂互不侵犯條約事、詢問外交委員李維諾夫意見、事後該社又接到官方發表文件、叙述兩國談判之經過、該文件言及里加爭執、謂互不侵犯條約中列入一欵、聲明兩國爭執之各種問題彼此不提、兩國政府對此種爭執問題仍各完全維持其見地羅馬尼亞代表堅不主張加入此欵、官方文件謂羅馬尼亞與蘇聯之間有爭執問題、乃世人所共知者、尤以柏沙拉比領土問題爲甚且於談判開始之前、羅馬尼亞即曾自行提出此項先决條件、以故羅馬尼亞反對列入此欵、殊無正當理由、羅馬尼亞方面曾提出各種不侵犯之方式、但此種方案解釋之結果、不啻使蘇聯間接承認柏沙拉比之佔領、故蘇聯對此種方案、明白拒絕、而另提他種方式、蘇聯所提之方式、則係明白表示該政府允許對於爭執之問題、無論如何不以暴力解决之、此種方式、不啻對羅馬尼亞完全担保蘇聯政府不致藉口柏沙拉比問題、而不遵守互不侵犯條約也官方文件又云、羅馬尼亞當局所求者、不在訂立互不侵犯條約、而在設法使蘇聯政府對柏沙拉比之佔領、加以間接承認或默認、此由討論　　　　見之云</p>

<p>（九）　程天放</p>
<p>專門職業學校招收高中畢業、而不能升入大學的學生、授以專門技能訓練、使成爲生產力很强的份子、因爲需要較完善設備的原故每一校只能偏於一科、如農業專門·工業專門·醫業專門之類、但是每一科中却應該斟酌社會的需要來分班、各班的工課和修業的期限都可以按照這一種職業的性質和學這種職業的人的志趣而定、譬如工業專門學校可以分土木工程、化學工程等等、但是儘管同樣學土木工程、甲的天資較高經濟情形又許他受較良久的訓練、那他就可以修業四年、畢業後可以做初級工程師或工程師助理、乙的天資較差、家境又不許他長期求學、他就可以進兩年畢業的班次、畢業後做工程師助手或監工員、同在一個學校、同在一科畢業、年限儘可有長短之不同、只要在證書上或載明修業年限和所學科目、社會上自然能夠分别他們的高低、不致發生錯誤、其他工程以至於農業商業醫藥等都是如此</p>
<p>專門職業學校性質和普通職業學校相同、應該絕對注重生產的技能、農業學校必須與農場打成一片工業學校必須與工場打成一片、商業學校必須與商店打成一片、醫藥學校必須與醫院藥房打成一片、有許多功課、都應該在農場、在工場、在醫院藥房研究、而不應該在敎室内研究、換句話講、必須以實物敎育去代替書本敎育、然後職業學校的學生畢業後學那一科的才眞正能夠做那一科的生產事業、據敎育部民國十九年度高等敎育統計、全國計有二十七個專科或專門學校、内中公立的二十一個私立的六個、除了法政藝術音樂鹽務警官稅務國學等外、其他含有生產敎育性質與我們所謂專門職業學校相等的、計有十三個、内中工業四農業醫藥各三、水產一商業一只商船一、這十三個學校總共只有一千二百四十四個學生、以這個數目來應全國的需要、照道理講是遠不夠的但是每年畢業的二三百學生、大多數是終日皇皇的在社會上找工作、一方面固然爲社會不安定、各種事業都不發展、另一方面則因爲專門職業學校的學生大部分所受的依然是重書本而不重實際的敎育、畢業後不能生產、這一點是改革專門學校所最應注意的</p>
<p>政府對於專門職業學校、應該定整個計劃、先看淸楚某一省需要某種人、然後去造就某種人、觀不需要的人就不必造、而造就出來的人則一定要適合社會的需要、例如江南各省正在大修公路、就應該設專門職業學造成公路工程師、淮河流域正在大興水利、就該設專門學校造成、水利工程師推而廣之、出磁器的地方應該辦磁業學校去研究改良磁器、出紙的地方可以辦紙業學校去種究改良紙張、專門職業學校只要能適合社會需要是愈多愈好的</p>
<p>現在要講到大學了、大學除師範大學政治大學應當單獨設置外、其餘可以合設也可以分設合設的則名爲大學其下分文·理·工·農·等科分設的則呌學院、如文科呌文學院理科呌理學院工科呌工學院、大學的性質和專門學校的性質根本不同、專門學校注重在技能的訓練而大學則應該注重學理的探討、問題的研究這一類的工作任何一個國家只有少數人能夠做、也只需要少數人去做、所以專門學校儘管可以多設、而大學則絕對注重質而不注重量、不必多設、一個設備完善辦理認眞能夠眞正養成人才的大學勝過十個簡陋膚淺、名不副實的大學、一個肯思想、肯研究、能夠領導社會向前進的大學畢業生勝過五十個無專長無能力、不能運用思想不能領導社會的大學畢業生、所以除了美國外、就是敎育程度極高的國家、如英德之類、國内大學的數目都是很少很少、而這幾個很少的大學却是國家集中全力在那裏辦的所以一切學術人才事業人才都可以在這裏面養成、美國的大學如果合Ｃollege和University都算在裏面、足有八百多所、數目令人可驚但是嚴格一點講起來、在這八百多大學當中、眞正辦理完善配稱做大學的、大槪未必出三十所以上、其餘的都只可以算做專門學校、美國有許多學者、對於本國大學名稱之濫、深致不滿例如弗勒斯雷Abrabam　Flesner在他所著［美英德大學］Universities，Ａmerican　English　German中就很坦白地批評美國大學的缺點、不但一般濫竽充數的大學爲他所攻擊、就是很著名的大學、如芝加哥哥倫比亞之類、他也指出許多不對的地方</p>
<p>很不幸的、中國近年來許多事倣效美國於是乎美國人大學以多爲貴的思想、無形中也深入中國人腦筋、於是乎國家也添辦大學、地方也添辦大學、私人也添辦大學、東也設大學、西也設大學、在大學全盛時期、專是上海一市、就有將近三十個大學報紙上滿載大學招生的廣告、眞是洋洋大觀、如果我們不求其實而求其名則上海市敎育程度之高、眞可以在全世界中首屈一指了、這裏面有些借辦大學來歛錢、的這種人固然是天良喪盡、罪不容誅、但是還有些人是的確拿出錢來辦大學的、這就是中了［大學以多爲貴］的套了、美國的大學雖則濫、然而人家一至少還有相當的設備、至少還認眞在那裏辦所以有許多學校雖則不應稱呌大學、至少還不失爲專門學校畢業出來的學生還可以覓相當的職業、至於中國、只要租幾間洋房、聘幾位敎員、招幾個學生、不論圖書儀器之有無、不問學生程度之高下、掛上招牌立刻就成最高學府、由這種樣的最高學府畢業出來的人、不但不配稱爲人才、連普通智識技能都很缺乏、在社會上自然成爲高等游民、引起社會種種不安現象、一方面害了個人一方面害了國家社會</p>

<p>學校裏的同事AB兩先生，各在市塲買了一個熱水瓶回來：牌子是同的，價格是同的，容量是同的，以及保溫二十四小時，也是同的；他們的意思，以爲：這兩個熱水瓶，是一同而無不同的了。</p>
<p>誰料，不然；到了規定的二十四小時以後，各把自己的熱水瓶試騐一下子，試騐的結果，竟是大不相同！Ａ先生瓶中的水，兀自蓬蓬地有熱氣；Ｂ先生瓶中的水，卻和冷水差不多了。</p>
<p>這個試騐的結果，當然引起ＡＢ兩先生的注意；在先，只道是瓶有好歹，一個傳熱，一個不傳熱；後來，再三討論，才覓得了一個答案：ＡＢ兩先生的熱水瓶都是不傳熱的，Ａ先生在二十四小時内，没有開過瓶的口，所以保留裏面的熱度；Ｂ先生急於要知道瓶水的熱度，在二十四小時内，曾把瓶口開過八九回，無怪裏面的熱度，漸漸的消耗了！</p>
<p>×先生在旁邊，喟然長歎道：</p>
<p>凡是口頭禪，當作如是觀。</p>
<p>ＡＢ兩先生請問其故，×先生道：</p>
<p>長期抵抗，不失尺土寸地，是政界的口頭禪。</p>
<p>愛國之心，未敢後人，從此不進仇貨，是商界的口頭禪。</p>
<p>臥薪嘗膽，還我河山，注重軍事訓練，誓復國仇，是學界的口頭襌。</p>
<p>枕戈待命，劍及屨及，任何犠牲，誓不屈服，是躱在關内的軍界的口頭禪。</p>
<p>多開一次口，多减一分熱；凡是口頭禪，當作如是觀。</p>
<p>政界，商界，學界，以及躱在關内的軍界，勸你們保留着熱水瓶中的溫度，不要時時開動這瓶口，把裏面的熱水變成了冷水。</p>

<p>希望是一個蕩婦·伊是放縱的，熱情的：伊的秀麗的容顏招致了無數人的眷戀和愛慕，伊的誘人的媚笑迷惑了四週的瘋狂的頂禮者：伊拿伊天賦的魔力控制的每個人的心，使每個人都願爲伊獻出全副的精力，甚或至於擲去了寳貴的生命，然而伊畢竟不是一個忠於愛情的婦人，伊没有貞操，没有固型的理智，没有單純的愛：伊的騙人的手腕是很高明的，再没有一個追逐伊的漢子能獲得最後的滿足。</p>
<p>我把一位外國文人的巧妙比喻演成上面的一叚話後，覺得文人的話終歸是寓意深奥，應用廣泛的，而在今日之中國，不正可以找出車載斗量的例子嗎？但同時我又覺得希望的掖引人向上的能力總是不可磨滅的，誰没有希望？那一件事業的成功不曾受過希望的鼓勵？然而在耽溺於希望裏的中國，希望卻眞成爲危險的蕩婦了。</p>
<p>顯然的，整個的中華民族現在是正浸於希望的夢一般的生活中哩丨政府當局希望國聯主持公道，希望美國維持九國公約的尊嚴，希望瀋陽事件會和濟南事件的結局一樣：一般人希望日本内部［自形崩潰，］希望日美大戰，日俄大戰，希望眞命天子出世，希望有劍仙或飛將軍自空而下，殺退矮兵數十萬，總之，民族的意識裏已經没有自覺和自信的成分存在了，命定的思緒據有了這老大的民族，每個人對於事實都缺少正面的認識，我們看了滬戰時，推背圖和燒餅歌一類書的暢銷，便可知道我們民族的生活是怎樣在希望的圈套中了。</p>
<p>耽於希望，便流於空想而不願想出切實的辦法：縱然有辦法也的缺少堅强的意去實行，這是民族自信心貧乏的表示，這是民族的病態的象徵，只這一點，便足夠亡中國而有餘了，所以我以爲中國的危險不在當前的國難，而在畸形的民族病態生活，但願每個人都能記着這位外國文人的話，一切的困難自然可以在剛果堅决的精神下消滅去！</p>

<p>丨勞資合作增加生產丨</p>
<p>本市國貨展覽大會，自在南市蓬萊市塲開幕以來，數日於茲矣。其宣傳方法，以及郵局在信件加蓋［勸用國貨］圖章等等，備形熱烈，頗足振瞶起聾，鼓舞人心。茲將會中觀感所得，拉雜誌之如左：</p>
<p>開幕之日，各界來賓及參觀者，竟達萬餘人之多。厥後數日，仍見踴躍。計參加之廠商二百餘家，陳列之商品四千餘件，琳瑯滿目，美不勝收，其中有多種物品，在品質上，價格上，均足與洋貨頡頏，具見年來國貨工業之突飛孟晋，更足證明國人對於土產，早有深切之注意。會中所列貨品，以日用品居多，次爲飲食品，再次爲敎育用品，俱能與外貨爭奇鬥勝。惟有多種重要舶來品，如新聞紙，人造絲，印刷所用之薄行紙，攝影所用之乾片，用具等，國貨中竟付闕如。即化學藥品，科學儀器，上等呢絨等等，亦不多覯。此雖半因我國科學程度，尙難與先進各國，並駕齊驅，而半亦由邇來國内時局多故，災禍遍地，經濟枯竭，資金艱澀，以及各廠頻演勞資糾紛等事實，致國貨工業前途，荆棘叢生。深望我國企業家，資本家，勞動界，値茲時艱，努力奮鬥：不因環境之險惡，而稍餒其氣，更須泯除成見，力謀合作。而在政府，對於一般新興工業，尤當盡其保護與獎勵之職責，俾國貨前途，或可光明燦爛歟！</p>
<p>會中陳列室，計分南北二所。位於北首者，爲第一陳列所，位於南首者，爲第二陳列所。各種國貨，多置玻璃櫉内，秩序井然。且其排列方式，蜿蜒曲折，頗含美化，使觀衆對於每種物品，均有欣賞之機會。第二陳列所中，最惹人注目，而爲觀衆驚嘆不置者，厥維新光化學工業社所產之燈塔牌藥沬滅火機。此機計分消防式，標準式，舟車式，輕便式四種，均用薄鋼板製造，中塗化合物，能使藥與該機，絕對不起化學作用。外部更塗新式噴漆，並裝克羅明蓋，鮮艶奪目。數星期前，曾在南市公開表演，備受各救火會及觀衆之讚美。是足爲國貨界放一異彩者也。</p>
<p>短訊張秋虫主編之萬歲雜誌，讀者咸謂能得［眞］［美］［善］三字眞諦。第六期已於十六日出版，除海鳴，春帆，恂子，卓呆，秋虫，之五長篇，及有連續性之［兩姊妹］，［海上靑樓沿革記，］［天花亂墜］，［近十年的上海］諸名作外，更有小蝶，半狂，逸雲，等傑作十餘篇，名貴異常。聞該社以擴充紀念，繼續徵求定户一萬人，在月底前訂閱全年，祇收五元云。</p>

<p>— 求幸福齋主</p>
<p>九一八的一夜，整個的瀋陽城×陽市，便都被日本軍隊輕輕巧巧的覇佔了去了。一家人，聽說外面大街小巷上，日本兵都在惡狠狠的隨便用槍上剌刀殺中國人，嚇得緊關起大門來，誰也不敢出去。佟一貞的叔叔，自也不能再去找高副官和李司令哨探坑害他姪女那件事是怎樣舉行了。而這一位司令一位副官兩個堂堂中國大軍人呢？對於有關身家性命的緊要消息是極其靈通的，早也聽得日本人要嚴厲膺懲舊政權，不能容他們耀武揚威的再活著：便也趁早脚底明白，忍痛扔下公館裏一些現成財產，脫下老虎皮一樣的軍衣，委屈著改扮個衣衫襤褸的苦力模樣，汽車也不敢再坐，只徒步逃到皇姑屯，坐北寗鐡路三等車，與一般難民一齊躱到山海關裏面去了。横豎到了平津，一樣可逍遥自在，更還許有更好的女人可玩，不必呆板板定要强占佟家的女學生作五姨太太，也自把佟一貞忘了個乾二凈，與忘掉東三省先人廬墓桑梓家鄉是一樣的輕鬆容易。</p>
<p>這就單便宜了佟一貞，無形中化險爲夷，把這一塲迫在眉睫的災禍消滅掉了。幷且伊和魯伯勤經過這一次患難中的堅固結合，彼此測量出對方愛情的眞正高度來，愛情的高度也隨之增加到了沸點，比從前還更爲契合無間了。</p>
<p>只是時事太不容樂觀，他俩的環境，也因而還是苦悶與惡劣。日本兵自强占了瀋陽與東北各地，徒造成一個極恐怖的世界。居民紛紛向關内逃徙，好一點的人家，幾乎搬得十室九空。那爲窮所累而搬不動的，只有關起大門來戰兢兢的坐在家裏等死。大街上是早已不敢行走了；小西邊門外的公園，駐滿了日本兵，萬泉河更似乎隔了個星球一般，沿途關卡重重，日本兵槍彈和剌刀下所犧牲的死尸纍纍，更没人敢冒險再去游賞。這一雙愛侶，在此時要繼續謀個朝夕的叙首，没有好地方可去；只好依舊訂些幽期密約，仍在衢衕中僻靜處所開個急促怱忙的露天會議。雖然佟家叔嬸已不大阻撓一貞的行動自由，而只是出乎善意的叮囑少要亂跑惹禍。</p>

<h3 id="e1">How to Stabilize the Sichuan Situation - Zi <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shunqing war on the first of this month, the situation in Sichuan, while not showing any significant developments, has seen more intense efforts to stop the war than the military actions of those directly involved. This demonstrates the nation's commitment to ending internal conflict. We have summarized four types of plans for stabilizing the Sichuan situation based on various actions and statements: (1) To maintain the status quo before the outbreak of hostilities, such as the Executive Yuan's telegram directly instructing various parties (Liu Wenhui, Li Jiayu, Luo Zezhou) to cease military action, persuading Liu Xiang, Deng Xihou, Tian Songyao, Yang Sen, and Liu Cunhou to mediate, and preparing to send high-ranking officials to Sichuan to mediate and end the conflict. (2) To redistribute the interests of military personnel in Sichuan to achieve peace, such as the reported proposal by over a hundred Sichuan army division and brigade commanders to outline a plan for governing Sichuan, advocating for the abolition of the defense zone system and financial transparency, and the discussions by representatives of Sichuan army units stationed in Nanjing to clarify military and administrative powers and redistribute defense areas. (3) To urge the central government to take firm action, as advocated by a certain northern newspaper, [stating that "the central government and related parties must first maintain a detached position and treat all factions of the Sichuan army equally, announcing measures with a fair and just attitude, ordering the Liu's and other generals to comply, and decisively punishing those who do not"]. (4) To advocate for civilian forces to stop the conflict, such as the proposal by fellow Sichuanese in Beijing to awaken the public to effectively stop the conflict.</p>
<p>To determine the effectiveness of the above four plans, we must briefly describe the actual situation of the Sichuan warlords' competition. Today, the ones who claim dominance over the 1.29 million square li of land in Sichuan are Liu Xiang, Liu Wenhui, Tian Songyao, Deng Xihou, Yang Sen, and Liu Cunhou, numbering six, excluding Luo Zezhou, Li Jiayu, and their followers. Among these six, Liu Wenhui and Liu Xiang each command 100,000 troops, Tian and Deng each command 50,000, and Yang Sen and Liu Cunhou's forces range from 30,000 to 10,000. Although Sichuan has vast land, the warlords are squeezed together. The strong seek to swallow the entire province, while the weak seek to take advantage of opportunities. Preventing chaos is inherently difficult. The beginning of this incident ostensibly involved Luo and Li receiving assistance from Liu Xiang in a defense dispute with Liu Wenhui's troops, but in reality, Tian and Deng were heavily involved. Yang Sen and Liu Cunhou were also not entirely bystanders. This is generally understood by most people. Based on these facts, the Executive Yuan's measures are clearly unlikely to be effective. The difficulty of redistributing benefits is also self-evident. The opinions urging the government are probably not valued by the generals. As for hoping for civilian sanctions, the people who have suffered from 467 wars in the past 21 years are definitely unable to shoulder this heavy responsibility for the time being. This is why the problem of stabilizing the Sichuan situation has become such an intractable issue today, and why high-ranking Sichuan officials in Beijing are unwilling to accept the mission of mediating in Sichuan.</p>
<p>Since the Republic of China, the central government's plans to control the Sichuan situation failed the first time when Chen Huan's army advanced deep into the province, and the second time when Wu Peifu used Yang Sen. After Dai Kan's demise, no outsiders dared to try to gain Sichuan. Under these circumstances, the issue of stabilizing the Sichuan situation can only be left to the people of Sichuan to bear the responsibility temporarily. [When the world is not in chaos, Shu is the first to be chaotic; when the world is settled, Shu is the last to be settled.] If the national politics has no solution, empty talk of stabilizing Sichuan is difficult to achieve. If the other parts of the country can be stabilized first, then the stabilization within the Kui Gate will be easier to start. We do hope that the Sichuan situation can be resolved, but its resolution cannot precede that of the other provinces. This is what those who are working to stabilize the Sichuan situation today should know.</p>
<p>Important Telegrams</p>
<h3 id="e2">Ma Zhanshan's Troops Attack Heihe from Six Directions <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Planes Bomb Hailar and Other Places</p>
<p>Volunteer Army Captures Shitouhezi and Anda</p>
<p>(Beiping) Ma Zhanshan has resolved to resist Japan, not only for the sake of Heilongjiang Province but also for the sake of the entire Northeast and the nation's reputation, putting personal life and death aside. The rumor that Ma sent representatives to raise funds is inaccurate. Ma has never raised funds from outside in his personal capacity. Ma Zhanshan reported on the 9th, arriving in Beiping, that his troops have launched a six-pronged attack. One route, led by Li Haiqing, has reached Qibuma. A second route, led by Deng Wen, has reached a place 18 li east of Bu Kui. A third route, led by Xu Hailing, has moved from Dahe Town to Sa Hazhai and Ning Lianzhai. A fourth route, led by Li Tiande and Li Yunju, is attacking Fenshan and Anzhen in the north. A fifth route, led by Cai Hongyou, is advancing from the Hu Hai Road. A sixth route, led by Shang Yanfang, has sent two regiments led by Zheng and Tian to attack Taian Town, which has been recovered. The current situation is excellent, and a final victory is determined. (17th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Ma Zhanshan telegraphed that the first route of the six-pronged attack on Heihe has reached Wuhu Ma, 18 li from the provincial capital. (17th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Su Bingwen telegraphed that Japanese aircraft squadrons bombed Hailar, Zhalantun, and areas along the Chinese Eastern Railway at noon on the 16th. The railway tracks between Hailar and Boketu were bombed in three places and have been repaired. (17th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese Army Attaché issued a statement tonight explaining the recent Japanese aircraft bombing of Hailar, claiming that Su Bingwen is detaining a Japanese passenger plane and refusing to return it despite various excuses, and that Su Bingwen appears to be trying to repair the plane for military use.

However, due to constant attacks by Liu Wenhui's troops, both places are in a state of war. In addition, the telegram from Division Commander Tang Shizun of Liu Xiang's army and others advocating for the reform of the Sichuan situation has not yet arrived in Beijing due to difficulty in transmission.

<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the Sichuan conflict, the Executive Yuan has telegraphed Liu and Li and Luo twice to stop military action, and telegraphed Tian Songyao, Deng Xihou, Yang Sen, and Liu Cunhou to try to mediate. The general situation of their replies is as follows: (1) Liu Wenhui replied, stating that he had obeyed the order to instruct the front-line troops to avoid military action as much as possible, and recounted the pressure exerted by various forces and his grievances, hoping that effective measures would be taken to stop it. (2) Liu Xiang telegraphed that after receiving the order, he would do his best to mediate. If Liu Wenhui exerts too much pressure, Li and Luo's troops will resist, making a conflict in the front lines difficult to avoid. However, he is still trying to mediate. (3) Li Qixiang and Luo Zezhou stated that after receiving the telegram, they would order their troops to stop military action and await instructions, and described the pressure exerted by Liu Wenhui's troops. (4) Liu Cunhou, Yang Sen, Deng Xihou, and Tian Songyao's telegrams were roughly the same, stating that they would do their best to mediate in order to eliminate the scourge of war.

At this time of external difficulties, no one should create misfortune and cause the central government to worry about the west. Recently, the generals issued a sixteen-point plan for governing Sichuan and advocated for a Suining conference, hoping it would be implemented. I believe that long-term stability should be sought, and methods should be planned. Using force before the methods are implemented would be like putting the cart before the horse.

Zezhou strictly ordered the brigade and regimental commanders to abandon Lie Mianxi and Zouma Chang and retreat to the Xiongjia Chang and Wangjia Zhai areas to maintain peace.

<p>(Nanjing) After returning to Nanjing, Foreign Minister Luo believed that it was necessary to convene another meeting of the Foreign Affairs Committee to further study the opinions on the report. As Central Committee member Wu Chao-shu came to Nanjing from Shanghai, Luo hosted a luncheon at the Guangdong Restaurant for Wu and the members of the Foreign Affairs Committee. At 3 PM, they went to the diplomatic residence to hold a meeting to discuss the matter. In addition to the members of the Foreign Affairs Committee in Nanjing, including Ju Zheng, Zhu Jiahua, Chen Gongbo, He Yingqin, Zhu Peide, Chen Guofu, and He Yaozu, Wu Chao-shu, as a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, was also invited to participate in the discussion. During the meeting, Luo first reported on the details of his consultation with Chiang in Wuhan, and the members shared their thoughts. The meeting ended at around 6 PM. It is reported that the members had largely agreed on their opinions, but further consultation with Wang was needed to finalize the details. Therefore, Luo decided to take the night train to Shanghai on the 18th to meet with President Wang. Wu Chao-shu crossed the river at 7 PM and went to Beiping by car with a certain lady.

There were rumors that three principles were decided upon and submitted to the Central Political Council, but attendees said that was not true. (18th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) In the past two days, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has repeatedly received telegrams from our delegation in Geneva, requesting instructions on opinions regarding the report and future directions. It was said that it was widely rumored in Geneva that China had many opponents of the report, creating a rather unfavorable impression, seemingly due to Japanese propaganda. Luo has replied by telegram that it is still under study and that the results will be reported soon. (17th Special Telegram)</p>

Rumors that the Central Committee would send someone to Shanghai to persuade Wang to cancel his departure are inaccurate. As for whether Committee Member Zeng Zhongming and Committee Member Chen Bijun will accompany Wang, he is still unaware. (17th Special Telegram) (Nanjing) Wu Chao-shu and his wife arrived in Nanjing by car from Shanghai on the morning of the 17th. Foreign Minister Luo, who has a long-standing friendship with Wu, personally welcomed them at the station. They first went to the diplomatic residence to rest. Luo and Wu had a long discussion. At around 6 PM in the afternoon, Wu and his wife crossed the river and went to Beiping by car. Wu answered reporters' questions as follows: (1) I have already expressed my opinions on the report in Shanghai and have no special opinions now, nor will I submit a written opinion to the Central Committee. (2) It is difficult to predict how the League of Nations conference will progress, but attention should be paid to the attitudes of Britain, France, and the United States. In short, for the Sino-Japanese issue, it is necessary to observe the international situation on the one hand, and use our own strength to implement our own demands on the other, in order to achieve satisfactory results. (3) The Japanese side's opinion on the report still uses the excuse that China is an unorganized and ungoverned country to wantonly attack and criticize. If the Chinese people do not unite and are keen on internal warfare, the consequences are unimaginable. (4) If the Republican Party wins the US election, its foreign policy will remain the same. If the Democratic Party wins, there will not be much change. It will likely be determined by Roosevelt and the views and attitudes of his diplomatic authorities. (5) I have not met Wang recently in Shanghai, so I am unaware of his departure. (6) The trip north is purely for travel purposes and has no other tasks. (17th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Foreign Affairs Committee held a secret meeting this afternoon at 4 PM to discuss the Lytton Report for two and a half hours. The results are unknown due to strict security.

<p>Four-Year Industrial Plan</p>
<p>Chen Gongbo Reports at the Central Memorial Week</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Gongbo spoke on the morning of the 17th at the Central Memorial Week about the Four-Year Industrial Plan, saying that the Ministry of Industry's plan centers on the Yangtze River. The Ministry initially intended to have twelve plans, and four have already been started: (1) Coal mines: The production near the Yangtze River is about 2.84 million tons. It is planned to divide it into twenty areas for mining, which can yield a profit of more than 33 million yuan per year. (3) Steel plant: A contract is currently being signed with the German Hope Company to issue 40 million yuan in public bonds to build a steel plant near the Yangtze River. Coal will be mined first at Leijiagou, which can be completed in about two years, with an annual surplus of 8.1 million yuan. (3) Sulfuric acid plant: Sulfuric acid can be used as fertilizer and for military purposes. It is planned to jointly operate it with the British and Germans, and it can be completed before June next year. Currently, a survey is being conducted in Hunan to determine the output of sulfur to supply the raw materials for this plant. (4) The Central Machinery Plant is nearing completion. The funds are paid by the British Boxer Indemnity. The location is at Caoxiexia in Xiaguan and will be completed within one year. Chen continued to say that the Ministry of Industry is currently facing two difficulties in implementing these plans: (1) Lack of survey funds. (2) Research materials rely entirely on books, which is extremely unreliable. He hoped that everyone would work hard and follow the plan so that the strength of future construction can be demonstrated. (17th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

At this time, someone telegraphed Shen Honglie, who, on the one hand, dispatched warships to land on the Yantai shore, and on the other hand, negotiated with the Japanese, shouldering the responsibility of protecting the foreign residents in Yantai, so that nothing happened. Because the Yantai municipal authority belonged to the provincial government, the political power has now been returned to the provincial government.

<p>Opposing the Suggested Sections</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Li Zongren expressed his views on the report on the 14th. He expressed satisfaction with the factual part of the report, but opposed the suggested sections, saying that according to the suggestions, the most that could happen is that Shandong would change from being exclusively occupied by Japan to being jointly managed by the League of Nations. Shandong would still not be ours. The country should not seek a hasty solution and adopt this incomplete approach. He also stated that China cannot rely on the League of Nations in any case. To recover lost territory, it can only rely on its own strength. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Claims the Russian Government Supplies Military Equipment to the Volunteer Army</p>
<p>(Harbin) The Japanese-run Harbin Times attacked Soviet Russia again today, stating that all units of the Volunteer Army west of Harbin carry Russian-made machine guns. Russian arms factories are all owned by the Russian government to prevent private sales. Therefore, the Russian government must be aware that the Volunteer Army has received these supplies. This action by Russia is simply a violation of international conventions and an interference in the affairs of other countries. It is therefore a clear indication of Soviet Russia's unfriendliness. However, the Russian Consul-General in Harbin denied the newspaper's report about Russian opposition to [Manchukuo] on the western section of the Chinese Eastern Railway to the Harbin Times reporter. (16th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e61">Serious Situation in the Far East: China, Soviet Russia's Promotion of Peace Policies <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Signing Non-Aggression Pacts with Neighboring Western Countries One After Another</p>
<p>Japan Has No Intention to Conclude a Treaty; Her Militaristic Ambitions are Evident</p>
<p>Romania's Attitude is Solely Dependent on France</p>
<p>Foreign Minister and Prime Minister Have Conflicting Policy Views</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Moscow, 16th – The Soviet government’s official gazette [Izvestia] stated in today's editorial that the Soviet Union and Romania's negotiations for a mutual non-aggression treaty have been unsuccessful after lengthy talks due to Romania's obstructionist policies, accusing the Romanian government of hindering peace efforts. It is reported that, given the serious situation in the Far East, the Soviet Union is constantly mindful of peace. Therefore, it promotes its peace policies with utmost calm, forcing even the most ardent militarists to temporarily abandon their playful attitude towards peace. The Soviet Union has successively signed non-aggression treaties with Finland, Latvia, Poland, and Estonia. The success of this peace policy is excellent. Even in France, where anti-Soviet forces are rampant, there is a tendency to accept the Soviet Union's peace proposals reluctantly. Romania is the only neighboring country of the Soviet Union that refuses to sign a treaty. Although the Romanian authorities cannot excessively reject the Soviet Union's proposal for a treaty due to the victory of the Soviet Union's peace policy, they have used various excuses to overturn the nearly successful treaty in the past year. Therefore, the Soviet Union is currently awaiting Romania's definitive response: whether it is willing to sign a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union like other peace-loving Eastern European countries or to persist in its policy of undermining peace according to the wishes of certain international elements.</p>
<p>TASS News Agency, Moscow, 16th – Today, Soviet newspapers published Foreign Minister Litvinov's remarks on the conclusion of the Russian-Romanian non-aggression treaty. Litvinov first recounted the historical process of the negotiations, pointing out that Romania had twice sent representatives to sign the draft treaty, only to undermine it herself twice. He stated that if Romania genuinely wished to conclude a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union and did not intend to achieve other indirect goals through it, the treaty could have been concluded long ago. Litvinov claimed that Romania's inconsistent behavior showed that there must be multiple forces fighting each other within and outside the country, and it was doubtful whether Romania had the sincerity to conclude the treaty, as its responsible representative also stated that such a treaty was not very necessary for Romania. The Romanian representatives often temporarily requested the removal of clauses established after lengthy discussions and replaced them with new clauses, clearly intending to create new disputes, prolong the signing period, or even sabotage the treaty. However, the Soviet Union's sincerity in concluding the treaty has remained consistent. Litvinov considered Romania's proposal to convene countries bordering the Soviet Union to conclude a multilateral treaty useless, believing that the Soviet government wanted to conclude bilateral treaties. As the facts have clearly shown, the Kellogg-Briand Pact was completely powerless to prevent the military conflict between China and Japan, both signatory countries. Therefore, the Soviet Union does not want its solemn treaties with other countries to become the same kind of diplomatic game.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Rome, 15th – Since the return of Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu to the capital, the political situation has not eased its tension, and the rift between Titulescu and Prime Minister Vaida has deepened. Even King Carol's efforts to mediate have had little apparent effect. It is reported that Titulescu still opposes concluding a non-aggression treaty with Soviet Russia, while Vaida insists on continuing direct negotiations with Moscow. Several cabinet members support Titulescu's position, demanding a change in the diplomatic policy that has always followed France's lead. Those close to Titulescu also claim that France recently intends to use League of Nations loans to intensify its control over Romania's diplomacy, making it necessary to plan for self-preservation early.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Rome, 16th – Today, during the celebration of the King's birthday, National Peasant Party leader Maniu met with Prime Minister Vaida and Foreign Minister Titulescu. Vaida and Titulescu both completely adhered to their original opinions, so reconciliation between the two seems hopeless. There were previous reports that Interior Minister Mihalache supported Titulescu's views, and there are fears that this would cause a split within the National Peasant Party. This matter seems to have been avoided for the time being, and Vaida's position has been consolidated before the renegotiation of the mutual non-aggression treaty with Soviet Russia. There will be two talks tomorrow, and the King may personally participate in the conclusion. Havas News Agency, Moscow, 16th – TASS News Agency inquired with Foreign Affairs Commissioner Litvinov regarding the Romanian-Soviet negotiations for a mutual non-aggression treaty. Subsequently, the agency received an officially released document describing the course of the negotiations between the two countries. The document mentioned the Riga dispute, stating that a clause was included in the mutual non-aggression treaty declaring that the two countries would not raise various issues of dispute with each other, and the two governments would fully maintain their views on these disputed issues. The Romanian representative firmly opposed including this clause. The official document stated that it is well known that there are disputes between Romania and the Soviet Union, especially the issue of Bessarabia. Moreover, before the start of the negotiations, Romania had already put forward this prerequisite itself. Therefore, there is no legitimate reason for Romania to oppose including this clause. The Romanian side has proposed various forms of non-aggression, but the result of interpreting these plans would be tantamount to the Soviet Union indirectly recognizing the occupation of Bessarabia. Therefore, the Soviet Union clearly rejected these plans and proposed other methods. The method proposed by the Soviet Union clearly indicated that the government allows that disputes would not be resolved by force. This method is tantamount to a complete guarantee to Romania that the Soviet government would not use the Bessarabian issue as an excuse to not abide by the mutual non-aggression treaty. The official document also stated that what the Romanian authorities seek is not to conclude a mutual non-aggression treaty, but to find a way to make the Soviet government indirectly recognize or tacitly approve the occupation of Bessarabia. This can be seen from the discussion.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 17th – The Russian government has proposed the conclusion of a Japanese-Russian non-aggression treaty as an exchange condition for recognizing "Manchukuo." The Japanese government has not yet taken a clear stance on whether to conclude a non-aggression treaty. However, the great powers are paying close attention to Japanese-Russian relations. The Japanese government has divided opinions on the Japanese-Russian non-aggression treaty, with some arguing that Japan is in a diplomatically isolated position due to the Manchurian problem. Therefore, it should approach Russia and conclude a non-aggression treaty to prevent the intrusion of communist ideology and promote economic cooperation between Japan and Russia. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that Japan and Russia are both signatories to the non-war treaty, so there is no need to conclude a non-aggression treaty immediately. Moreover, it believes that those who think that concluding a non-aggression treaty can prevent communist propaganda do not understand the position of the Third International. Therefore, Russia, which is incompatible with Japan's national polity, is a useless associate and must be watched. As for Japan's diplomatic isolation, there is no need to panic, as the countries seem to gradually understand Japan's actions. Therefore, there is no need to change the diplomatic policy, which is a rebuttal to the previous argument.</p>

<p>The Democratic Party is Confident of Victory</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 16th – With the presidential election approaching, the Democratic Party predicts that its presidential candidate, Roosevelt, will receive the support of ten million voters and believes that if there are no unexpected changes in the next three weeks, the number of votes in the upcoming primary election will be even higher. This prediction is based on the results of the Literary Digest's straw poll and the Democratic Party's shift in public opinion in Maine. It is reported that the party will focus its efforts on states that appear to be reliable, while leaving less reliable areas to the discretion of local party leaders.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, London, 17th – According to news from Washington, if Democratic presidential candidate Roosevelt wins the next election, President Hoover plans to first appoint Roosevelt as Secretary of State, and then resign along with Vice President Curtis.

<p>Reason Cannot Match Emotion</p>
<p>The Military Forces the Finance Minister to Implement Tax Increases</p>
<p>The Saito Cabinet's Crisis Lies in the Budget</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 17th – The estimated expenses of the budget proposal for the next fiscal year submitted by the various government ministries are said to total 2.4 billion Japanese yen, an increase of approximately 600 million yen compared to the unprecedentedly large budget proposal of 1928-29, and an increase of approximately 800 million yen compared to the average budget proposal of the previous ten years. The Ministry of Finance will, of course, advocate for efforts to economize, but it is believed that the maximum amount that the Ministry of Finance can allow is far from the minimum amount that the ministries deem impossible to reduce, which may cause a serious cabinet crisis. The expenses for the Manchurian war are already huge, and the so-called supplementary expenses of the army and navy are also very large. Therefore, the budget expenses set by the army and navy total more than 1 billion yen. The future dispute will likely lie in these national defense expenses. Although Finance Minister Takahashi has changed Inoue's policy of frugality and not issuing bonds, there is still a shortfall of over 1.3 billion yen in balancing the budget proposal. It is feared that Takahashi may not be able to allow the issuance of this huge debt to make up for it. Moreover, Takahashi is still opposed to increasing direct taxes. It is reported that Army Minister Araki strongly advocates increasing inheritance tax and income tax to raise this amount. If the rumors are true, then the military and Takahashi's supporters will clash greatly. According to many people's speculation, if this happens, the military seems likely to win. As a certain Japanese celebrity stated, in today's Japanese politics, reason often cannot match emotion. If Araki wins, Takahashi will likely be forced to resign, and the cabinet will collapse along with him. The resulting turmoil may be even more serious than after the assassination of Inukai Tsuyoshi.</p>

<p>Japan's Opinions Diverge</p>
<p>The Military Advocates Separate Control of Manchuria</p>
<p>The Colonial Ministry Proposes Joint Control of the Three Colonies</p>
<p>Hua Lian News Agency, Tokyo, 17th – Regarding the issue of economic control between Japan and Manchuria in the Japanese plan, the Japanese government's opinions are divided and still unable to agree. The goal is annexation, but the various parties have slightly different opinions on the method of annexation. The military and the South Manchuria Railway Company argue that the control between Japan and Manchuria should not include Korea, Taiwan, or Karafuto. If they are included together, it would be the same as Korea and Taiwan becoming colonies, making it inconvenient to argue with other countries. This would not only lose the sympathy of other countries, but also be too large in scale and be under the jurisdiction of the Colonial Ministry, preventing the military from obtaining real power. However, the Colonial Ministry advocates that the three colonies of Korea, Taiwan, and Karafuto must be included together to achieve the goal of annexation. If this plan is not accepted by the military, another committee will be organized to control the three colonies, recruiting directors of various ministries and departments, high-ranking colonial officials, and financial magnates as members under the jurisdiction of the Colonial Ministry. Regarding this plan, due to the many divergent opinions from various parties, the final decision will likely be made after the puppet representative Xie Jieshi enters Beijing.</p>

<h3 id="e72">Future Tale of Japanese-American Naval War <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Since the Manchurian and Shanghai incidents, Japan's apprehension towards the United States has increased day by day. On one hand, it seeks to ease international tensions, and on the other, to carry out its policy of aggression in mainland Asia, it is actively preparing for war against Russia and the United States. So-called air defense drills, naval exercises, attempts to smooth things over with various countries, and dispatching representatives are all being arranged with a sense of urgency. In particular, the younger officers in that country, who disregard international public opinion and advocate resolving issues through force, continue to spare no effort. Consequently, in the past few months, no fewer than thirty or forty books regarding [Japanese-American War], [Japanese-Russian War], [War between Japan and England and America], [Future Wars in the Pacific], etc., have been openly published, fully revealing the ambitions of warmongers. The United States, due to various reasons, remains taciturn despite Japan's intimidation. However, the confrontation between the two countries is deepening, and the future eruption of calamity is to be expected. Herewith is a translated summary of the [Future Tale of the Pacific War] as published by the Tokyo Kokumin Shimbun and the [Naval War in the Pacific] as published by the Tokyo Yorozu Choho, to allow readers to understand Japan's preparations for war against the United States. It is not difficult to infer the attitudes that England, Russia, France, Italy, and other countries will adopt after war breaks out between Japan and the United States. – Translator's Note</p>
<p>The Pacific Ocean has never suffered the scourge of war since ancient times. Whether it can maintain its peace in the future is difficult to predict. However, judging from today's international situation, it is feared that it will be difficult to avoid a tragic tragedy. Why is that? Because we (Japan) are being labeled with the ignominious name of aggressor by the United States, and diplomatic relations between the two countries are almost like swords drawn and bows strung, with the potential to explode at any moment. If our country were to go to war with the outside world, it would have to bet its national fortune on coping with them. In addition, our nation's awareness must be prepared for a do-or-die gamble to determine the rise and fall of our national fortune. However, we are confident that the final outcome of this war will not be defeat, because our country's military defense capabilities are already more than sufficient. Although we are not a war-loving people, if we encounter a situation where we want to avoid it but cannot (i.e., when our national policy and diplomatic methods fail to achieve their goals, or when the enthusiasm among the people boils over), then the only final means is to resort to war. If war were to break out, it is feared that more than one country would be our enemy. Japan's military equipment is primarily focused on defense, and a defensive attitude should be adopted to counter enemy countries. Looking at Japan's geography, from the Kuril Islands in the north to Taiwan in the south, with various islands dotted in between, we can draw a battle line and prepare submarines and aircraft to engage in a final decisive battle with the world's powerful nations. This time, unlike the European War, we will not rely entirely on the army as the main force, causing the war to drag on for six or seven years. Because our war with the United States will be a purely naval war, and the outcome of a naval battle can be decided in a short time. The concern is, if war breaks out between Japan and the United States, and England joins the United States against Japan, can Japan's naval battles be victorious? Here is a brief description of the naval strengths of the three countries, England, the United States, and Japan, and the conditions of the Pacific war defenses.</p>
<p>(I) The Existing Strengths of the Three Countries: England, the United States, and Japan. The first requirement for war is the spirit of the people and excellent soldiers. The strength of will to fight and the use of sophisticated weapons are particularly important. Since the Washington and London conferences, Japan's construction of warships has been limited. The naval strengths of England, the United States, and Japan are listed below:</p>
<p>Capital Ships	Cruisers	Submarines	Aircraft Carriers</p>
<p>Japan	Ten	Thirty-eight	Eighty	Five</p>
<p>398,084 tons	290,900 tons	80,095 tons	87,000 tons</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>United States	Seventeen	Thirty-two	One Hundred Twenty-Two	Seven</p>
<p>520,038 tons	320,034 tons	120,096 tons</p>
<p>England	Eighteen	Fifty-three	Sixty-four	Eight</p>
<p>550,059 tons	337,000 tons	60,012 tons	120,077 tons</p>
<p>(II) The Prediction of War in the Pacific: It is easy to imagine how fierce the war in the Pacific will be. The United States' entire fleet of 1.5 million tons is now concentrated at the San Pedro naval port on the Pacific coast. Its capital ships, such as the West Virginia, are equipped with eight 40cm cannons, and there are also huge coastal guns on the coast, arranged facing west. The aircraft hangars of the Saratoga and Lexington are fully stocked with elite air forces, and everything is presided over by the famous Admiral General Chief of Naval Operations Bullard. As soon as the order is given, they will advance to Hawaii. The Hawaiian Islands are only 3,500 nautical miles from Yokosuka Naval Port. They will use Pearl Harbor as their center and advance westward. At the same time, the fortress of Ma'a Island in the South Pacific and the air force bases in the north, such as Dutch Harbor and other important ports in the Aleutian Islands, will echo each other from afar with the main force in Honolulu, either as their wings or as their waiting ports, operational bases, and supply depots for military supplies. Locations such as San Francisco, Hawaii, the Ogasawara Islands, the Ryukyu Islands, China, and the Philippines must be connected into a line. However, for operational reasons, they will avoid the Ryukyu Islands and the Ogasawara Islands, and focus on Hawaii, Guam, and the Philippines. Guam Island has a strong radio station and is an important relay point for the United States to the Philippines. However, the defense of Guam Island is inferior to that of Hawaii. Yokosuka is 1,000 nautical miles from Guam, and Hawaii is 3,300 nautical miles from Guam. Due to geographical relations, before the arrival of the American fleet, a part of the Japanese fleet can easily capture Guam. Manila in the Philippines is also equipped with fortresses and a standing air force of 1,800 aircraft, including no fewer than 400 fighters, reconnaissance planes, and heavy bombers, as well as one airship. The operational range of its best aircraft is 25,000 kilometers, which will pose a major threat to the skies over the Orient. In peacetime, in order to ensure the safety of commercial routes, the American Oriental Fleet, based in Manila, which is 1,500 nautical miles from Yokosuka, will take a encirclement formation, linking Alaska, the Aleutian Islands, Hawaii, Guam, and the Philippines once war breaks out. May I ask how the defense of the Orient is? Although the Kuril Islands in the north are sufficient to counter Alaska and the Aleutian Islands, and the submarine fleet in the Ogasawara Islands can resist the fleet dispatched from Hawaii, the Ryukyu Islands and the Magong Fortress line in Taiwan in the south are not optimistic for defense naval operations. Moreover, the British Far East Fleet, with the 10,000-ton Kent-class cruiser as its main force, will hold the world's maritime rights with the large fortresses of Hong Kong and Singapore and defend Hong Kong with all its might. On one hand, it will guard the throat between the Orient and India and Europe. The so-called Singapore Fortress and the Australian fleet under its jurisdiction will also participate in the war. Can the Japanese Navy support it at that time? Although our army defeated enemy ships in the Russo-Japanese War, today, with the invention of new weapons and the change of strategy, the air force, which assists naval battles, will be very fierce. How this combat capability will determine the victory or defeat of both sides. According to recent information, the United States has three of the latest aircraft carriers, and Japan has four. Our [Akagi] can compete with the American [Saratoga] and [Lexington]. Comparing their performance, the [Akagi] is 26,900 tons, has a speed of 28 knots, is equipped with 14 high-angle guns and 12 secondary guns, and carries 50 aircraft. The [Saratoga] is 33,000 tons, has a speed of 33 knots, is equipped with 8 primary guns and 12 secondary guns, and carries 83 aircraft. The two ships can bombard each other at a distance of 30,000 meters. However, the Japanese Navy's unique first-class destroyers are the world's unparalleled elite. At present, there are twelve first-class cruisers, such as the large Kako and Furutaka, followed by the Kongo, Hiei, Kirishima, Haruna, Fuso, Yamashiro, Ise, Hyuga, Nagato, and Mutsu battleships, sixty-eight first-class destroyers, and eight that will be completed, including twenty large ones. Considering the combat power, it is not inferior to that of England and the United States.</p>
<p>(III) The Great Naval Battle in the Western Pacific: If Japan and the United States go to war, the American fleet, gathered along the coast of California, will be connected from bow to stern, reaching 250 ships, and will begin to advance westward. They will use the destroyer squadron and patrol ships as the front line, with reconnaissance cruiser squadrons protecting both sides. The flagships West Virginia, Colorado, Maryland, and the 10,000-ton Augusta-class large cruisers, submarine tenders, long-range submarine squadrons, mine warfare squadrons, and other special service ships and super-large aircraft carriers will advance to the base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. From Hawaii, they will move westward to meet the enemy. It is expected that the war will be divided into two phases. The first phase of the operation will be the seizure of enemy bases and the active deployment of submarine cruiser squadrons, belonging to a surprise attack. In the battles to capture the two fortresses of Manila and Guam, the war will be very fierce. At that time, Guam, with its relatively inferior defense capabilities, will be occupied by the Japanese army. Manila, with its substantial air force, Far Eastern Fleet, and natural terrain, and equipped with 16-inch cannons, will resist the Japanese army's attack with all its might. However, with Japan's elite fleet, the American Navy will adopt a defensive posture. However, our army, based on the principle of quick battles and quick decisions, will engage in a large battle between the two main fleets. In this way, Manila can be occupied in less than ten days, and then we can advance to the Hawaiian base. Thus, a great naval battle will occur on the western Pacific coast. When our side receives a warning that the American fleet has left Hawaii, the flagship Mutsu, which is waiting in the Ogasawara Islands, 囗囗, 囗囗, etc., will begin to move out. At this time, wooden sailing ships from the Nelson era will be sunk in succession after being shelled by our artillery. After the mine warfare squadron's fierce attack, we will achieve a great victory. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Has telegraphed the military authorities with the inspection results.</p>
<p>Whether he returns to Beijing depends on when he receives a telegram from the authorities.</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Li Yue and Fan Yuhuang, special commissioners dispatched by the Military and Political Department to inspect Jiaodong, after arriving in Jinan, immediately went to Yexian and Laiyang to conduct inspections. Except for Li Yue, who had already returned to Beijing to report to the Military and Political Department about the meeting with Liu Zhennian's representative, Li Henghua, Fan Yuhuang, who went to Laiyang for inspection, also returned to Jinan by the third Jiaoji train from Jiaoxian at 10:30 last night (the 14th). He stayed at the Jiaoji Hotel. Zhang Shouqian, a senator of the provincial government, also returned to Jinan on the same train as Fan. After resting briefly at the Jiaoji Hotel, Fan went to the Jinan Central Bank to meet Jiang Bocheng to report on the inspection in Laiyang and telegraphed the Military and Political Department and the Military Commission. At ten o'clock this morning, Han hosted a banquet for Fan at the West Flower Hall of the provincial government and invited various dignitaries to accompany him. Fan is now waiting for a telegram from the Military and Political Department to determine the date of his return to Beijing. According to Fan, who spoke to visitors at the Jiaoji Hotel today, the situation in Laiyang is very good. The two sides are more than ten li apart, and the outposts are at Shuigoutou, which is more than fifty li away from Laiyang City. There are many plainclothes troops of Liu's army there, constantly harassing the Third Route Army. The front of the Third Route Army is now the self-defense army organized by the masses in Jiaodong, which often clashes with Liu's plainclothes troops. As for the Third Route Army troops, there have been no clashes with Liu's army. He first went to Gu Xian and then to Shuigoutou, where he stayed for a day. He returned to Pingdu that day and arrived in Jiaoxian from Pingdu the next day. He then returned to Jinan on the third Jiaoji train from Jiaoxian. He will telegraph the Military and Political Department with the details of his inspection in Laiyang. Whether he goes to Beijing or stays in Jinan will be decided after the military headquarters replies to Jinan by telegram. He has reported the details of his inspection in Laiyang to Chief of General Staff Jiang. The Jiaodong issue will probably be resolved. (October 15th)</p>
<h3 id="e74">Jinan District Court <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Hearing of Zheng Jicheng's Case</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The provincial government, acting on the order of the Executive Yuan, transferred Zheng Jicheng, the assassin of Zhang Zongchang, who caused a sensation in the north and south, from the Military Law Office of the Third Route Headquarters on the 24th of last month to the Shandong Higher Court. The Higher Court sent it to the Jinan District Court. After repeated interrogations by prosecutors Zhu Weiran and Zhu Fengxiang of the District Prosecutor's Office, Zheng Jicheng was publicly prosecuted on the 7th of this month for the crime of premeditated murder. The detailed circumstances have been described in previous letters. At 9:30 this morning (the 15th), the trial was held publicly in the Criminal Division 1 of the Jinan District Court. The judges Li Hongye, Li Guixin, and Zhou Peiji, the clerk Zhang Piji, the prosecutor Zhu Weiran, the defendant Zheng Jicheng, and Zheng's lawyers Zhou Qingen, Sun Baifu, and Li Yunsheng all arrived on time. Zheng was wearing a gray woolen jacket, blue riding pants, formal woolen multi-layered shoes, with short hair, and looked energetic and smiling. He did not appear tired or exhausted. Bi Shizhen, the patrol chief of the Southwest Township Public Security Bureau, and police officer Cao Yuke, who were present at the time, also testified in court. The gallery was extremely crowded. Hu Xu, the president of the District Court, and most of the court's staff were also present to observe. After the court session began, the judges took their seats and first questioned Zheng Jicheng. They asked Zheng Jicheng's name, age, hometown, occupation, and whether he had committed any crimes before. Zheng replied, "I am Zheng Jicheng, 40 years old, from Licheng, residing at No. 7 Bianzhi Alley. I am currently the director of the Licheng Charity Association and am a person of honor. I have never committed a crime before." They asked how many siblings he had. He replied, "There are four brothers in my branch. My eldest brother has passed away. My second brother and younger brother both work on the Yanwei Road." They asked who Zheng Jinsheng was to him. He replied, "He is my uncle, that is, my adoptive father. I was only a few years old when I was adopted. At that time, my uncle had no children. Later, he had a son in his old age." At this point, the judge asked prosecutor Zhu Weiran what his opinion was on the case. Zhu stood up and said that the main points of his opinion were detailed in the indictment. The judge then asked Zheng Jicheng if he had seen the indictment and if he had anything to say about the prosecutor charging him and Chen Fengshan with conspiring to kill Zhang Zongchang and punishing him according to Article 284 of the Criminal Code, which deals with more serious offenses. Zheng replied, "Killing Zhang Zongchang was to avenge my father's death, and I, as a revolutionary, was removing obstacles for the revolution." They asked if he had shot Liu Huaizhou and Liu Qingxun. He replied, "There were no two Lius when I killed Zhang, and I have never known the two Lius. I have no hatred with them, so how could I kill them?" They asked, "Why did you kill Zhang Zongchang and what were the circumstances at the time?" Zheng replied, "I have already said that killing Zhang Zongchang was to avenge my father, eliminate harm for the people, and remove obstacles for the revolution." They asked, "What day was it?" He replied, "September 3rd." They asked, "Where did you go from?" He replied, "I am the director of the Charity Association. I must go there every lunar 3rd and 6th. It happened to be the 3rd day of the eighth lunar month. I went from home to the association and returned at three o'clock. On the road, I heard people talking about Zhang Zongchang harming Shandong and causing the May 3rd Massacre. It would be better if he died in Shandong to relieve the people's hatred." At that time, I could not help but be moved. When I got home, friends left at one thirty. I ate because I had a stomach illness. Usually, I drink a glass of medicinal wine before meals. After that glass, I thought about the passersby and wanted to kill Zhang. I had a vendetta to avenge my father, so I should kill him even more. At that time, I was on fire and could not eat. I only ate a bowl of rice and told my family that I was going to the train station to send off a friend surnamed Li. I went to Shi You-san's house (Zhang lived in Shi's house) to call and ask if Zhang had left. I didn't get through, so I went to the station with Chen Fengshan by car. When I arrived at the station's west gate cave, Chen Fengshan first shot me and told me that I wanted to kill Zhang to avenge my father and that he was not allowed to fire randomly. I then entered the station, and Chen followed me. When I arrived at the second platform, Zhang Zongchang was already grabbing the car door to see off guests. More than ten people seeing Zhang off under the car were all unfamiliar to me. They all wished Zhang a safe journey. I then took out my gun and shot Zhang. One shot missed. When I was changing the bullet, Zhang shouted "Not good!" and ran into the car. I followed and fired the second shot, which also missed. I changed the bullet again. Zhang ran to the east car door and wanted to get off. I fired the third shot, which still missed. I changed the bullet again. Zhang ran down the car. I chased him down and tripped over iron wire on the second platform. I got up and chased him. When Zhang ran to the north shore of the third platform, I had returned to the south shore and fired the fourth shot, knocking Zhang down under the platform. Because I didn't know if he was dead or not, I went down and shot him in the head twice. Seeing that he was dead, I shouted that I was avenging my father and surrendered to the law enforcement team." They asked, "When was your father, Zheng Jinsheng, killed by Zhang?" He replied, "November 14th, the 16th year." They asked, "How did he die?" He replied, "He was tricked and killed. At that time, my father was the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Eighth Route Army of the Northern Expedition, and Liu Zhenhua was the Commander-in-Chief, stationed in Caoxian. Division Commander Jiang Mingyu colluded with Zhang and falsely claimed that Zhang wanted to raise the flag of the Blue Sky with a White Sun. My father believed it to be true, was tricked to Jinan, and was brutally murdered. Later, a secret order was issued to arrest me in Tianjin. I escaped to Japan." They asked, "When did you know that Zhang was coming to Jinan?" He replied, "It was on the 2nd of the newspaper. I don't know which day he came. He came and lived in Shi's house. On the morning of the 3rd, I went to the Charity Association at eleven o'clock. I took a car, but the car broke down halfway. I walked back. I didn't bring a gun when I went to the association. I don't remember if Chen Fengshan followed me. I returned to Bianzhi Alley at three o'clock. I don't remember if Chen Fengshan was at my house at that time because I didn't pay attention. I went to the backyard to accompany guests for dinner. If I hadn't heard people say it on the road, I wouldn't have known that Zhang was leaving today. At one o'clock, I called Shi's house, but I didn't get through. I said I was sending a friend surnamed Li to the train, not that Zhang Zongchang's luggage was already on the train. They must have misheard." (To be continued)</p>

<p>Detailed Account of the Bizarre Shooting and Tragedy in the West City: No. 30 Fulangzhong Alley in the west city is a well-known institution for manufacturing poison pills. Its scale can be called a giant in Suzhou, and the number of victims is unknown. Unexpectedly, at nine o'clock on the sixteenth night, the sound of knocking on the door was heard from outside. Thinking that the police were coming to search, the person in charge led the others to climb onto the roof and tried to escape to Ye Haimen's house at No. 17 Xiangjiaham. At that time, Ye and his daughter were about to go to bed when they suddenly heard the sound of lead skin on the balcony. They looked through the window and vaguely saw two figures and were greatly frightened. They shouted for catching thieves wildly. The servant Tian San also used a foreign iron dustpan to knock around. Hearing the sound, the neighbors mistakenly thought it was a fire and reported to the West District Fifth Section Fire Brigade by telephone. The firefighters gathered and set off, carrying the fire truck through Tonghefang, Jinjinqiao Alley, and turned to Shengjiaham. At this time, the knockers were scattered at both ends of Fulangzhong Alley and Xiaofennong Alley. The two people on the roof had entered Ye's house and politely asked for help and accommodation. The sound of catching thieves and the sound of fire alarms were rising and chaotic. The firefighters also gathered at the scene, but they did not see any fire. They only heard someone shouting "Fire!" in the crowd and temporarily took refuge in the Sheng's tailor shop in Xiaofennong. Before long, gunshots were heard. The bullets flew from behind, five shots in a row, causing a great tragedy. It was reported that one firefighter from the Fifth Section of the West District, Chen Huasheng, died on the spot, and six people were injured. After the incident, Chief of the Public Security Bureau Mao Naigong, Inspector Zhang Nanchun, Director of the Second Branch Pan Renxian, and the competent officials of the fifth Precinct of the Second Branch, Tour Official Fang Ziqing, guerrillas, county police team, the bandits water police three areas, the detective team and other officials in charge, arrived one after another, inspecting separately. Two half-exploded bullets were found on the wall of No. 19 Shengjiaham at the entrance of Xiaofennong Alley. While they were investigating, a person escaped from the door without a house number between No. 33 and No. 34 Fulangzhong Alley (the side door of the poison pill manufacturing institution) and ran straight to the home of Dr. Gu Yunruo in the opposite Zhaoming Alley. Chief Mao ordered the police to arrest him. He claimed to be named Guo Xianglin. Chief Mao also sent police to search the poison pill institution. Two opium pipes and a large number of poison pills and poison pill seals were confiscated. The seals were printed with the words "Yishang Shanghai Zhongyuan Pharmaceutical Company Sealed". Because there were too many poison pills, police were dispatched to monitor and guard them. Another person named Ye Yi was found upstairs and was taken to the fifth Precinct of the Second Branch together with Guo Xianglin. On the morning of the 17th, they were transferred to the Second Branch and then to the Public Security Bureau. Xu Fu, who was staying at the Guangmin Hospital for treatment, died at 7:30 on the morning of the 17th due to his injuries. The District Court dispatched Prosecutor Qian and coroner to inspect the body at 3:00 p.m. on the same day. The Public Security Bureau is currently investigating the origin of the shooting.</p>

<p>Major Fire on Xiaodongmen Heng Street: At 7:30 p.m. on the 14th of this month, a fire broke out suddenly at Yixingsheng Paper Store on Heng Street outside Xiaodongmen. Electricity and telephone wires were burned, and the fire was so bright that it was like daylight. The cause of the fire was said to be electrical, or it was said that the store caused the fire by burning paper offerings and accidentally dropped sparks. The streets there were narrow. When the firefighters arrived at the scene, the streets had been burned and they could not get water, which caused the fire to spread to the neighbors on the left and right and also to the Huayuanham shops in Nanmen. Fortunately, the Central District Fire Brigade detoured to Huayuanham to put out the fire, and it gradually subsided. It is reported that the burned shops were: Miaoxingsheng Fish Shop, Yixingsheng Paper Store, Sanshanzhen Meat Shop, Tongsheng Native Goods Shop, Donglai Candle Shop, Shi Yongtai Silver Shop, Wanmaotong Oil Shop, Hongmao Hotel on Heng Street, and Yangshunxing Water Mill Shop and Zhang Tongxing Fresh Meat Shop on Huayuanham. Other shops, such as Hexing Wine Shop, Lu Gongji Fish Shop, and Shenyu Cigarette Shop, were spared from being burned because firefighters tore down those shops. Among them, only Tongsheng and Yixingsheng Paper Store had fire insurance, and the rest had no compensation at all. It is estimated that more than twenty houses were destroyed, about one hundred and several rooms, and the loss was about 200,000 gold. Tongsheng's loss was the greatest. Wang Genda, the owner of Yixingsheng store, was ill in bed. The fire burned the mosquito net before he escaped naked, and the skin on his lower body was burned. His wife was also slightly injured. He was sent to the hospital for treatment. It is said that Wang's life is worrying, and one of the firefighters fell from the roof and was seriously injured.</p>

<p>All Silk Factories Resumed Work Yesterday</p>
<p>The general strike of silk factories throughout Wuxi County has now come to an end. All factories resumed work uniformly today (the 17th). Yesterday afternoon, the three provincial committee members, He Yushu, Li Mingyang, and Zhang Gongren, convened a meeting with labor representatives at the Railway Hotel. Approximately forty people attended, including the nine executive committee members of the Silk Factory Industry Association, one male and one female worker representative each, and representatives from various factories. County Magistrate Chen also attended. First, County Magistrate Chen explained the purpose of the meeting. Following him, the three provincial committee members, He, Li, and Zhang, gave instructions successively. The main idea was that silk is China's only major export commodity. Recently, due to the dumping of Japanese silk abroad, the market has been heavily pressured, leading to a downturn. During this time of national crisis, it is imperative to strive for unity between labor and capital to revive the silk market and resist the Japanese encroachment and dumping, which is already a challenge. Now, a labor strike has occurred, and the dispute remains unresolved. This is tantamount to pushing the silk industry into a dead end and giving the Japanese an opportunity to develop. Therefore, the provincial government is deeply distressed and attaches great importance to this issue, so we were dispatched to mediate. The provincial government's main focus for resolving this labor dispute is to resume work first and then mediate. If anyone deliberately disobeys or stirs up trouble, they will be dealt with according to military law. Regarding the labor's demands, we will, within a possible range, take into account the interests of both labor and capital and arbitrate fairly. If there is indeed undue oppression by the capital side that the labor cannot tolerate, the capital side will be strictly ordered to improve. However, the fact that the silk market is depressed and that the factories are on the verge of collapse must also be taken into account at the same time, and so on. The meeting adjourned at around 3 p.m., and then a meeting was convened with the capital side. At 6:30 p.m., He, Li, and Zhang reconvened the military and police to discuss matters such as protecting the resumption of work and organizing patrol teams to set out on patrols. That evening, the three committee members, He, Li, and Zhang, immediately summoned both labor and capital to discuss the fair compromise, telegraphed the county government for instructions, and sent a letter to the county party headquarters ordering the announcement to both parties for their information. Any actions that disrupt public order are strictly prohibited. The compromise stipulated: 1. Working hours: Work begins at 5:45 a.m. and ends at 6:15 p.m. daily. 2. Bonuses: For those who work a full ten days each month, a bonus of one day's work is awarded. For those who work a full sixteen days, a bonus of two days' work is awarded. If work is stopped for half a day, half a day's work is deducted. If work is stopped for one day, one day's work is deducted, and so on. 3. Wages: A. For those on a monthly salary system: 43 cents. B. For those on a point system: The minimum wage shall not be less than 33 cents. 4. All factories must comply with the above three items without exception. 5. For the time being, the above-mentioned method will be implemented. During the effective period of the agreement, if the price of mid-grade silk rises to 850 taels, the original agreement should be restored. At the same time, all executive committee members of the Silk Factory Industry Association immediately notified all workers of the above-mentioned method, instructing them to work with peace of mind and strictly observe order. This morning at 4:30 a.m., the executive committee members set out separately to persuade and guide the female workers to work. The three committee members, He, Li, and Zhang, considering that the labor strike had been settled and their mission had been completed, planned to visit the People's Education Institute today, attend the County Chamber of Commerce's meeting on people's food, and then leave Wuxi to return to their towns.</p>

<p>Ancient Artifacts Discovered Due to Riverbank Collapse</p>
<p>Nijia Bridge in the eastern countryside of Yangzhou County is located along the Yangtze River. Since the floods occurred last year, collapses and landslides have been frequently observed, especially recently. Local residents are startled several times a night and have moved away in groups. Several days ago, another collapse occurred with a loud crash, submerging dozens of acres. In the sunken area, an ancient coffin was discovered. A resident, Huang, gathered people to exhume the bones. While opening the coffin, five ancient bricks were unearthed from the loess pile. On the left side was the inscription "Yongchang, Year Nine." On the upper right corner were the two characters "Wang Shi" in ancient seal script. Although eroded and damaged, they were still recognizable. According to historical records, Yongchang was the reign title of Emperor Yuan of Jin. These bricks must be from the Jin Dynasty. After obtaining the bricks, Huang ordered further digging into the spring, where dozens of ancient copper coins were found with strange and profound inscriptions, making it impossible to identify the dynasty to which they belonged. Also found were jade figures, bracelets, mud bricks, and earthen jars, all with extremely ancient and rich colors, which are delightful.</p>
<p>Reduction or Exemption of Grain Tax in Western Farmlands</p>
<p>The crops in the western mountainous areas of this county have been sparse since the summer due to scarce rainfall, and the ditches and ponds are dried up, making irrigation impossible, resulting in withering and barrenness. The villagers have reported the disaster one after another. Previously, County Magistrate Yang, accompanied by Tao Zeji, the director of the first section of the Finance Bureau, went to the 9th and 10th districts to conduct on-site inspections. The areas most severely affected are the eight villages of Chenjiaji, Xiejiaji, Yijuji, Liujiaji, Ganquanshan, Dingguji, Dayiji, and Hangjiaji in the 9th district, and the two villages of Leitang and Beishanying in the 10th district. The three villages of Gongdaoqiao Yangshou, Fangjiaji, etc. in the 9th district, and the eight villages of Yugaotang Bridge, Da Hao Village, Da Yi Village, Liangjiaxiang, Nianqiao Village, Huangjue Bridge, Northern Temple, Kongjia Bridge etc. in the 10th district are less affected. It has now been stipulated that the affected paddy fields in these two districts will have a reduction of 65% in the silver and rice tax, while the mountain paddy fields will have a reduction of 70% in the silver and rice tax, and the mountain fields will be completely exempt. Although the autumn crops in the remaining districts 2, 4, 7, and 8 have been bountiful, many farmers did not plant wheat due to the previous year's flood, and the villagers requested exemption from upper rush work. County Magistrate Yang has now decided to combine this with the autumn survey according to the disaster survey regulations, and during the lower rush work, the silver and rice tax to be paid will be reduced by 60% out of 100%, and the reed tax will be treated the same. According to statistics, the reduction percentage for the transport rice fields is 22% out of 100%, and the reed tax is 6% out of 100%. As for the military colonies of Yangzhou and Zhenjiang, most of the fields are scattered everywhere and the soil is barren. Only after careful consideration, the military colonies in Yangzhou and Zhenjiang will have a general reduction of 25% in Jiangdu, a general reduction of 70% in Ganquan, and the Zhenjiang military colonies will have a general reduction of 30% in Jiangdu. A comparative table has been drafted and submitted to the three departments of the Provincial Government, Civil Affairs, Finance, and Industry, for review and approval.</p>

<h3 id="e82">A Humble Proposal for Reforming Chinese School Education <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>(9) Cheng Tianfang</p>
<p>Vocational schools should enroll high school graduates who cannot enter universities and provide them with specialized skills training to make them highly productive individuals. Because they require more complete equipment, each school can only focus on one subject, such as agriculture, industry, or medicine. However, each subject should be divided into classes according to the needs of society. The curriculum and duration of study for each class can be determined according to the nature of the profession and the interests of the students. For example, an industrial vocational school can be divided into civil engineering, chemical engineering, etc. However, even if they are studying the same civil engineering, if A has higher aptitude and his economic situation allows him to receive longer training, then he can study for four years and graduate as a junior engineer or engineer assistant. If B has lower aptitude and his family does not allow him to study for a long time, he can enter a two-year graduation class and graduate as an engineer assistant or foreman. Although they are in the same school and graduate in the same subject, the length of study can be different. As long as the certificate specifies the duration of study and the subjects studied, society will naturally be able to distinguish their levels and there will be no mistakes. The same applies to other engineering fields, as well as agriculture, commerce, and medicine.</p>
<p>The nature of vocational schools is the same as that of ordinary vocational schools, and they should absolutely focus on production skills. Agricultural schools must be integrated with farms, industrial schools must be integrated with factories, commercial schools must be integrated with stores, and medical schools must be integrated with hospitals and pharmacies. Many courses should be studied on farms, in factories, and in hospitals and pharmacies, rather than in classrooms. In other words, practical education must replace textbook education. Only then can vocational school students truly be able to engage in the production business of the subject they studied after graduation. According to the Ministry of Education's Higher Education Statistics for the 19th year of the Republic of China, there are 27 specialized schools in the country, including 21 public and 6 private. Apart from law, politics, art, music, salt administration, police, taxation, and Sinology, there are 13 others that have a production education nature equivalent to what we call vocational schools, including 4 in industry, 3 each in agriculture and medicine, 1 in fisheries, 1 in commerce, and 1 in merchant marine. These 13 schools have a total of only 1,244 students. Judging from this number, it is far from enough to meet the needs of the country. However, most of the two or three hundred students who graduate each year are anxiously looking for work in society all day long. On the one hand, it is because society is unstable and various businesses are not developing. On the other hand, it is because most vocational school students still receive an education that emphasizes textbooks rather than practice, and they cannot produce after graduation. This is the point that should be paid the most attention to in reforming vocational schools.</p>
<p>The government should formulate a comprehensive plan for vocational schools. First, it should clearly see which province needs which type of people, and then train that type of people. There is no need to train people who are not needed, and the people who are trained must meet the needs of society. For example, the provinces south of the Yangtze River are currently building highways on a large scale, so specialized vocational schools should be established to train highway engineers. The Huai River Basin is vigorously developing water conservancy, so specialized schools should be established to train water conservancy engineers. By analogy, places that produce porcelain should run porcelain schools to study and improve porcelain, and places that produce paper can run paper schools to study and improve paper. The more vocational schools there are that can meet the needs of society, the better.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about universities. Apart from normal universities and political science universities, which should be established separately, the rest can be established jointly or separately. Those that are established jointly are called universities, and they are divided into arts, sciences, engineering, agriculture, etc. Those that are established separately are called colleges, such as the College of Arts, the College of Science, and the College of Engineering. The nature of universities is fundamentally different from the nature of vocational schools. Vocational schools focus on skills training, while universities should focus on the exploration of academic theories and the research of problems. Only a few people in any country can do this kind of work, and only a few people need to do it. Therefore, vocational schools can be established in large numbers, while universities absolutely emphasize quality over quantity and do not need to be established in large numbers. A well-equipped university that is run conscientiously and can truly cultivate talent is better than ten simple, superficial, and unworthy universities. A university graduate who is willing to think, willing to research, and able to lead society forward is better than fifty university graduates who have no expertise, no ability, cannot use their thinking, and cannot lead society. Therefore, apart from the United States, even in countries with extremely high levels of education, such as England and Germany, the number of universities in the country is very, very small. However, these few universities are where the country concentrates its efforts, so all academic talents and business talents can be cultivated there. If we include both colleges and universities in the United States, there are more than 800, which is a shocking number. However, strictly speaking, among these 800 universities, the number that are truly well-run and worthy of being called universities is probably no more than 30. The rest can only be regarded as vocational schools. Many scholars in the United States are deeply dissatisfied with the abuse of the name of universities in their own country. For example, Abraham Flexner in his book "Universities: American, English, German" frankly criticized the shortcomings of American universities. Not only did he attack the general universities that are just filling numbers, but he also pointed out many problems with even very famous universities, such as Chicago and Columbia.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in recent years, China has imitated the United States in many things. As a result, the American idea that universities are valued for their quantity has unconsciously penetrated the minds of Chinese people. Therefore, the country has added universities, the localities have added universities, and private individuals have added universities. Universities are established in the east and universities are established in the west. During the peak period of universities, there were nearly 30 universities in Shanghai alone. Newspapers were full of advertisements for university enrollment, which was a grand sight. If we only pursue the name without pursuing the reality, then the level of education in Shanghai can truly be ranked first in the world. Some people in this use the pretext of running a university to raise money, and these people are undoubtedly conscience-stricken and guilty of unforgivable crimes. However, there are also some people who are indeed taking out money to run universities, and this is because they have fallen into the trap of "universities are valued for their quantity." Although American universities are rampant, at least they still have considerable equipment and are at least running them seriously. Therefore, many schools, although they should not be called universities, are at least still vocational schools, and the students who graduate from them can still find considerable jobs. As for China, as long as you rent a few foreign houses, hire a few teachers, and recruit a few students, regardless of whether there are books and instruments, and regardless of the level of students, you can hang up a signboard and immediately become an institution of higher learning. People who graduate from this kind of institution of higher learning are not only not worthy of being called talents, but they also lack ordinary knowledge and skills. They naturally become high-level idlers in society, causing various social unrest phenomena, harming individuals on the one hand and harming the country and society on the other.</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Education Department, according to the report submitted by the Nantong County Education Bureau, stated that the county's Farmers' Education Center has worked hard to promote livelihood education over the years, carefully teaching farmers new methods of scientific weaving and dyeing, and promoting the improvement of Nantong homespun cloth, which has achieved remarkable results in a practical and realistic manner. The various types of cloth woven are finely organized, and the new patterns are comparable to foreign goods and are widely sold, which greatly benefits the farmers' livelihoods.

<p>Since the former Director of the Education Department, Cheng, appointed Xu Zejun to return to his hometown to head education in Xuyi, he has worked hard to reorganize it. However, due to rampant bandits, combined with floods and droughts, the economy is in a state of collapse. Director Xu has strived to support it and has not stopped teaching. Various educational undertakings have also been progressing gradually. Unexpectedly, a small number of people have fabricated accusations and filed complaints. After repeated impartial investigations by the two county magistrates, Jiang and Wang, they have reported back to the Education Department for cancellation. Recently, blank letterhead left by the former director was used, and Director Xu's name was forged, to resign to the Education Department. Director Xu has telegraphed the Education Department to investigate the matter thoroughly. Various institutions such as the county government and the education association have submitted reports to the Education Department, requesting that the false submission be sent to the county for thorough investigation and punishment. It is heard that Director Xu is still performing his duties as usual, continuing to guide famous school education, and is planning to establish a public education center, increase the number of public schools, and collect documents to preserve antiquities.</p>

<p>Mr. Li Bojun served in the Shanghai Municipal Education sector for nearly ten years, serving as the principal of the Municipal Yangzheng and An Elementary Schools. He planned the construction of school buildings, organized school affairs, and his achievements were well known. Unfortunately, this summer, while planning to expand the An Elementary School and contacting charitable organizations to rent the remaining houses of the Qiliu Public Office, he contracted typhoid fever due to traveling back and forth under the scorching sun, and unfortunately passed away before fulfilling his long-cherished aspirations.

<p>New Basketball Techniques (13) (Not Allowed) Original by Claire Burcky (Reprinted) Translated Jointly by Zhang Guodong and Qian Yiqin. Whenever a ball is thrown out of bounds near the basket, the attacking team can easily gain possession. Therefore, the defending team must be especially vigilant. Without skillful throwing and passing, good opportunities are often missed, leading to regret. Now, the American basketball coach Ward Lambert has used the quick advance and straight-throw shot method to instruct the Purdue Team, and it has been very effective. Now, the diagram is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Number 1 holds the ball and stands outside the baseline under the basket. Numbers 2 and 4 stand on either side of the free throw circle, facing the basket. Number 3 stands about one yard behind the center of the two. Then, Numbers 2 and 4 run towards the corners to lure away their defenders. At the same time, Number 3 runs forward to receive the pass from Number 1 and shoot.</p>

<p>The Situation is Stable, Resulting in a Good 2.2 Taels. Yesterday, the situation in the gold market was still stable, with little change. The price rose slightly. Throughout the day, only 2.6 taels changed hands. The demand from various firms was not high. Compared to last Saturday, the price rose by 2.2 taels. As for the silver market, the London exchange was stable and the US exchange dropped in yesterday's telegrams. The exchange rate rose slightly, while silver declined, so the opening price was high. It then rose to the 730 tael mark. However, there seemed to be many sellers. The foreign exchange market was mediocre and then turned downstream. The fluctuation was only about one or two taels in the middle of the day. The future market was slightly better. There were still about 5,000 contracts of November expiring in December that had not been settled. Yesterday, they were mutually settled by Da Feng, Heng Heng Xing, Yuan, etc., and the premium was 2.9 taels. Then, because many parties wanted to raise the price, they were unwilling to sell, causing the price to increase to 3.45 taels. However, short sellers could not easily respond. By now, there were more than 21,000 contracts of December terms. The central bank continued to purchase more than 400 contracts of spot gold. It was transmitted through Tai Kang Run Ying, Heng Run Chang Yong, etc. The price was 729.5 to 728.7 taels. The situation of yesterday's market is recorded below:</p>
<p>The Opening is Also Good, 2.2 Taels. The December opening price was 728.8 taels, an increase of 2.2 taels. Because it was Monday, there was no news from the silver market. However, the previous day's telegram from the American bank showed a small increase of one-eighth, and a small increase of one-sixteenth privately. Large volumes showed that people's hearts were trending upward. Da De Cheng, Zhao Feng Chang, Heng Yu Zhi Feng, Yong Yuan Mao Yong, etc. continued to buy, continuing to increase the price by 1 tael.</p>
<p>Anda absorbed $625 of May US dollars, which was 30 taels. However, Heng Yu, Da De Cheng, Fu Yu, Yuan Da Yong, Yong Feng, etc. successively dumped their holdings.

At 9:30, HSBC's listed price remained unchanged. The domestic market was flat. January US dollars were priced at 6.875. Holland issued 375 this month, then it was 8 taels and 3 cents. Later, because Mitsui, etc. absorbed $625 of January US dollars, people's hearts seemed good. Because Heng Yu Yuan Xing Yong Fu Feng Heng Yuan Tai Lai bought, Qian Chang Xiang sold 105 contracts of spot gold to the central bank, which was immediately used to offset December contracts, so the price returned to 8 or 9 cents, 29 taels and 2 cents around 10 o'clock. After a while, Yuan Mao Yong Yi Feng Yong Heng Xing, etc. sold. Because HSBC sold $4375 of October US dollars to Mei Feng, the price fell back by 1 tael. At 10:30, it was 28 taels and 1 cent. Afterwards, Tian Feng Yong Yuan Tai, etc. bought and pulled the price up by 4 or 5 cents, to 28 taels and 6 cents. After 10:45, there were slight ups and downs of 3 or 4 cents.

In one hour, there was only a return of one or two cents. Later, Yuan Mao Yong, Da De Cheng, Yi Yu, and small accounts all sold, causing the price to fall back by 7 or 8 cents.

<p>丨Bank Buying and Selling Appetites Wane丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silver market's atmosphere did not fluctuate much, but it was slightly higher than the white loan situation of the previous afternoon. It is feared that there will be no clear prospects. After the huge surge in the offshore interest rate, the market was generally stable in the previous two days, but yesterday afternoon it actually fell, with a difference of more than two li. The reason for this is that the banks' appetite for buying and selling has waned, and the situation has suddenly weakened. Therefore, the market atmosphere is far less strong than last week.</p>
<p>Interest Rate Prices: [Offshore Interest Rate] The interest rate fell in the early market, calculated as 7 qian, 0 li, 7 hao, 1 si, and 2 hu and a half, a decrease of 6 hao, 2 si, and a half compared to the previous afternoon's market. The afternoon market fell another 1 li, 2 hao, and a half, to 7 qian, 0 li, 5 hao, 8 si, and 7 hu and a half, resulting in a drop of 2 li, 1 hao, and 2 hu and a half compared to the previous morning's market. [Silver Discount] The early and afternoon markets were both 4 fen, which was much better than the white loan in the previous afternoon's market. The addition of premium and water was calculated at 1 qian and 12 fen. The silver market situation was slightly better.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market: The Jiangnan small foreign coin suddenly rose by 5 li in the early market, calculated as 6 qian and 2 fen. The afternoon market improved by 1 li, calculated as 6 qian, 2 fen, and 1 li. The transaction volume was 12,000 jiao in the early market and 7,500 jiao in the afternoon market. The Guangdong small foreign coin was the same in the early and afternoon markets at 5 qian, 9 fen, 8 li, and 7 hao and a half, a slight improvement of 2 hao and a half compared to the previous afternoon's market. The transaction volume was 145,000 jiao in the early market and 45,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins remained at 423,000 wen, with a transaction volume of more than 51,000 wen.</p>
<p>Silver Dollar Inflow and Outflow: [Silver Funds] Because it was Monday yesterday, the bank's receipts and disbursements were relatively numerous.

<h3 id="e102">Securities and Bond Market Extremely Desolate <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday (17th), the situation in the various bond markets of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was that although various spot markets opened, each only had 1,000 yuan, totaling only 5,000 yuan. The futures market was also extremely desolate. The atmosphere was cold from beginning to end, indicating that the market was extremely quiet. It is estimated that the transaction volume in the morning was 1 million and 620,000 yuan in the afternoon, totaling only 1.62 million yuan. Except for the Unified Salt Tax 20 Customs, each accounted for about 300,000 yuan, while the rest were very quiet. The 96 Financials continued to have no market. As for the trend of the prices of various bonds, the situation in various regions was very dull, and there was no slight change in the flaws in the bond market. The atmosphere became increasingly quiet, new transactions were rare, and the market was mostly for small-scale swap transactions. The demand and supply situation was very flat, and the price fluctuations were very slight. As a result, it was slightly lower than last week, only about 1 or 2 jiao. The current situation in the bond market is becoming increasingly dull.</p>

<p>Xin Feng Foreign Company reported that on Saturday of last week (15th), the New York stock market was very strong because the public predicted that the number of freight cars would gradually increase. According to the report, the number of freight cars this week was 625,655, an increase of 3,560 compared to last week, which was not as good as expected, so the price fell back. The half-day transaction volume was 593,510 shares. Overall, the stock market may enter a fluctuating state within the day. The stock price must be supported by the progress of industry and commerce. The recent improvements were originally common phenomena in the months of September and October. The fundamental industries have not yet shown significant improvement, so it is still questionable whether the economy has truly recovered. On the other hand, the current stock price has fallen by 20 pounds from the peak in September. Without unexpected developments, it may not plummet again. The Dow Jones Index for the 15th is listed on the left:</p>

<p>丨Spot Sales Increase to 4,180 Bales丨</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn Market Trends Strong. The rising wind is fierce. Because of the continuous decline in recent days, sellers have put great pressure on the market, causing those who have made profits to close their positions. At the same time, customer purchases have become more active, especially in the southern ports. As a result, people's hearts have been greatly shaken, and the market has suddenly turned upward. However, Shen Xin Factory is still slightly selling off. In short, the base has become dry and small. Outsiders are generally absorbing and preparing for a long time, so it is difficult to predict the future situation.</p>
<p>The Man-made Bid is Raised by More Than 2 Taels. The man-made bid opened in the morning with a slight decline in American cotton. However, buyers in the market were generally making profits, and the market atmosphere suddenly tightened. Each month rose by 4, 6, 75 cents. In the afternoon, it was heard that customer sales were smooth, and the market atmosphere was very brisk. The near month rose by 1 tael, 5 or 6 cents. The distant month rose by 5 cents. The total transaction volume for the day was 43,500 bales. It was found that Mingde sold 1,750 bales, Yi Chang sold 5,250 bales, Tong He sold 850 bales, and Xin Cheng sold 650 bales. Da Feng bought 1,950 bales, He Shen bought 1,200 bales, Zong Long bought 1,050 bales, Chang Feng bought 3,100 bales, and Chang Chu bought 950 bales. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>Active Spot Purchases in Southern Ports. The spot yarn disposal has suddenly improved. The Guangdong gangs have bought the most. The statistics for the day show that the various gangs bought a total of 4,179 bales. The market rose by 1 or 2 taels. The purchase amount for each party is listed below:</p>

<p>The Cotton Market Was Still Weak in the Morning. Because Shen Xin Factory vigorously sold more than 30,000 dan in the two-month period of December and January, the market was overwhelmed by it. However, general retail investors tended to buy. Yong An Factory was still quietly buying the October quota. It can be seen that both the bulls and bears are manufacturers, and the competition is fierce. However, yarn sales are gradually becoming active. Some manufacturers have a slight intention to purchase raw materials. There may be a great change in the future of the cotton market.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Retail Investors Tend to Buy. The Zheng Biao market opened in the morning with American cotton flat and weak. However, there were few sellers in the market. The price rose by 5 points in the near month. The price fell in the far month due to Shen Xin's sell-off. In the afternoon, the price was boosted by the yarn market. Each month rose by 1.35 cents. The total transaction volume for the day was 103,100 dan. It was found that Xin Cheng sold 29,900 dan, Ji Feng sold 3,800 dan, Ming Hua sold 1,800 dan, and Ming De sold 2,200 dan. Yi Chang bought 8,700 dan, Sui Jiang bought 4,000 dan, Geng Feng bought 3,100 dan, Yi Feng bought 2,100 dan, and Da Feng bought 2,700 dan. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>The Demand for Raw Cotton from Factories Has Also Improved. Spot cotton sales have gradually become active. Due to the improvement in yarn sales, each factory has the intention to purchase. The sources are calculated as Yao Cotton 1,791 bales and Tong Cotton 1,150 bales. The sales disc is listed below:</p>
<p>Tongzhou Cotton 32.00 Su Lun entered 1,500 bales. Spot goods sent to Suzhou.</p>

<p>Because the arrival of new cotton was not overwhelming last week, and the market price was low, there was not much hedging. Export activity was relatively strong in Japan. The sales of Pilar were all shipments to the Far East and Europe, but Europe especially liked to buy Ping Geer. The arrival of old cotton exceeded the same period last year, so the spot market was quite uneasy when the new goods were about to arrive. The cotton harvest was generally satisfactory. Pilar and Sula areas benefited from rain, and the rest of the areas still needed rain. The statistics for last week are attached below (unit: thousands of bales):</p>

<p>丨West Road Rice Boats Detained En Route丨</p>
<p>Hu Nan: Yesterday, the source from West Road was very scarce because the rice boats were detained in the Tangkou area, so the price of each commodity rose sharply by 4 or 5 jiao.</p>
<p>Xin Zha: Yesterday, about 30 boats from West Road arrived on the Suzhou River bank. The street's transactions were not very light. Changshu, Kunshan, Jiangyin, etc. all newly raised 2 jiao. Bai Ge Yao and Qu Township rushed to purchase, so the price rose. Xu Yang and Du Jian were sold as soon as they arrived, and the market price was fixed. The situation of old and broken rice was improved.</p>

<p>丨Market Optimistic After Rice Ships are Blocked丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market initially showed a slight downward trend. However, due to the decrease in rice shipments arriving from the interior southern market and reports of ships being looted en route, forcing them to divert elsewhere, the market sentiment in this area turned optimistic. The rice market quickly became active. The small-batch rice trade, which had been sluggish for a long time, saw a transaction of over 1,000 bags yesterday. Saigon rice also opened with over 500 bags. Although prices have not yet risen, there is an expected upward trend. The opening price for first-grade Saigon rice was $9.175 to $9.05, and small-batch rice was $7.70 to $7.35. Several hundred bags of small-batch rice were taken by the northern merchants, while the rest were mainly purchased by local merchants. Recently, the arrival and stock of Xiangxian rice have been low, but a small amount of Xiangyuan rice has arrived. A small amount of Xiangxian rice is also expected to arrive this month. Yesterday, 50 bags of newly arrived Hunan rice were offered at $11.30, which is nearly a dollar less than at the beginning of last month.</p>

<p>Yesterday's starch market saw recent inactivity from factories. Both existing and new starch were being handled by outside merchants. The market was initially weak but later improved. The forward market remained soft due to small wheat reports from overseas and factories seeking to offload stock. Furthermore, Australian white wheat, which was sold at 3.83 taels the day before yesterday, fell to 3.775 taels yesterday, a decrease of 0.045 taels. Foreign firms still intended to lower prices for sales. As a result, March was down 0.0075 taels, January and February were each down 0.005 taels, December and October remained unchanged, and November rose by 0.0025 taels.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Wheat Futures Show Downward Trend <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat market, foreign wheat was reported down 0.02 or 0.03 taels. Existing foreign wheat was also being peddled, making the situation even more sluggish. In the afternoon, there was empty space. Compared to last week's market, the trend remained downward. Additionally, foreign wheat prices might need to decrease due to the declining exchange rate. Therefore, market sentiment turned downward, and short selling continued. At closing, this month was down 0.01 taels, next month was down 0.02 taels, December was down 0.03 taels, January was down 0.03 taels, and February and March were each down 0.03 taels. Factories remained greedy for existing wheat. 2,700 bags were offered yesterday, with Yao wheat at 3.4 taels, Liuhe wheat at 3.33 taels, Shaoxing wheat at 3.37 taels, and Guandian Jiangbei wheat at 3.33 taels.</p>

<p>According to a report from Sin Fung Foreign Firm, Chicago wheat fell $0.0075 to $0.01 per pound last Saturday (the 15th) due to poor export demand and profit-taking by bulls. Transactions on the 14th totaled 30 million bushels. The market prices on the 15th are listed below:</p>

<p>December Futures, 48.250, Down 1.00</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw little fluctuation in the Dutch exchange rate. The trend in the association's pricing was stable. Twenty-fourth grade raw white sugar was priced at 14.875 taels, and high-grade sugar was priced at 14.95 taels, similar to before. Eighteenth-grade medium white sugar was priced at 14 taels due to a shortage of twentieth-grade medium white sugar. The Dutch red market was tight. The stock of Qing grade sugar was less than a thousand. High-grade sugar was priced at 9.67 taels. The local factory's ice flower Qing sugar was still priced at 12.2 taels. Although there were no transactions, the price trend was very strong. The Five Blessings White Crystal Sugar from the Dalai Company had very firm prices. It was said that it would not be sold for less than 10.07 or 10.08 taels because there were no shipments expected in the near future and stocks were low. Therefore, the seller was demanding higher prices.</p>

<p>Although there have been many recent arrivals of dried longan, top-grade large-sized longan only accounts for less than 20%. Supply cannot meet demand, and there is a shortage. Yesterday, the quoted prices for genuine large-sized longan saw a slight increase, and trading firms reported that the shortage of high-grade goods and the small profit margins led to a decision at a public meeting yesterday to increase the price of top-grade longan by 2 taels, while the prices for other grades remained unchanged. Due to ample stock, the quoted prices for medium and low-grade longan have decreased.</p>

<p>丨Market Price Increases丨</p>
<p>Recently, due to unrest in Sichuan, the supply of wood ear fungus has been blocked. Therefore, the previously weak market has turned firm and stable. Large-sized secondary ear fungus, which had previously fallen below 90 taels, has now risen to 93 or 94 taels. Local brand ear fungus is at 51 or 52 taels. The price of miscellaneous ear fungus had fallen to as low as 46 taels. At its weakest point, some in the industry expected it to fall to 44 taels. The current market price has risen to 47 or 48 taels to 49 taels. Sales among Fujian merchants are still good, and scattered transactions are also considerable. If sales volumes continue to improve, the market may continue to tighten.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the silk market in Shanghai was calm. Telegrams regarding future silk prices sent to New York and Lyon by Chinese silk merchants last week are expected to arrive in Shanghai in the next few days. Both Chinese and foreign parties remain firm in their positions. Yesterday, Gong An imported 20 packages of Tianlong brand top-grade, 13-15 filature Shanghai white silk at 675 taels. Xinfu imported 20 packages of SF brand top-grade, 13-15 filature Shanghai white silk at 670 taels. Kaili imported 30 packages of top-grade, 13-15 filature Sichuan yellow silk at 485 taels.</p>

<p>The filature silk produced in Xun (Nanxun) and Zhen (Zhenze) is highly sought after in Europe and America. Chinese silk exports rely heavily on Xun and Zhen filature silk. Since the new silk came on the market, the filature silk reeled in Xun and Zhen has begun shipping to Shanghai due to diminishing Shanghai stocks. Yesterday, a total of 120 pieces of raw and re-reeled silk were transported by small river boats and flower-decorated carts and were collected by silk merchants at silk warehouses.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Wuyuan Zhenmei Tea Slightly Active <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Less than 20% of the Wuyuan northern route Gongse Zhenmei tea has been sold since the new tea came on the market. This sluggish sales performance is unprecedented in recent years. Yesterday, British firms Jinlong, Baochang, and Tongfu began purchasing Zhenmei tea from this route due to the arrival of telegrams from Africa. However, sales volumes are small, and the market price has decreased by 30 to 40 taels, making it difficult for the market to improve. Sales of Tunxi hand-rolled and famous Zhenmei tea have also become slightly more active. There have been scattered transactions of Gongxi needle tea and other varieties, but the selling prices have all decreased compared to before. Only Shucha tea saw stronger demand from British firms Tongfu and others, while stocks were low, causing the market price to rise slightly.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Metals, Hardware and Green Lead Sales are Strong <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the hardware market was very active due to strong purchasing interest from the Qingdao merchants. Merchants from Yantai, Tianjin, and the Yangtze River area were mainly purchasing assorted goods. There were few large transactions. The most shipped goods were Malou iron sheets, steel pipes, Xin Yang galvanized iron, and shear steel. Black iron sheets, triangular iron, and green lead also saw some sales. Prices for most goods remained stable, except for Malou iron, which rose by 0.01 taels to 10.035 taels for 90 pounds, 12 taels for 100 pounds, and 20.08 taels for 200 pounds. Arrivals have been scarce recently, and overseas prices are also high. Therefore, if business conditions improve, local prices will naturally only increase and not decrease.</p>

<p>Since the price of Kailuan lump coal dropped, various parties have been actively purchasing it. The previous stock of tens of thousands of tons has been sold out. As of yesterday, the Five Companies had no stock available for sale. The good sales performance is unprecedented. It is now learned that two large ships carrying new goods, totaling over 10,000 tons, will arrive in the next few days, which should prevent any shortages.</p>

<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>Two colleagues, Mr. A and Mr. B, each bought a thermos from the market: the brand was the same, the price was the same, the capacity was the same, and the 24-hour insulation claim was also the same. They thought these two thermoses were identical in every way.</p>
<p>Who knew, it wasn't so. After the specified 24 hours, they each tested their own thermos, and the results were very different. The water in Mr. A's thermos was still steaming, while the water in Mr. B's thermos was almost as cold as water.</p>
<p>The result of this test naturally attracted the attention of Mr. A and Mr. B. At first, they thought it was just that one thermos was good and the other was bad, one conducting heat and the other not. Later, after repeated discussions, they found an answer: both Mr. A and Mr. B's thermoses did not conduct heat, Mr. A did not open the thermos's mouth within 24 hours, so it retained the heat inside. Mr. B was eager to know the temperature of the water in the thermos, and had opened the thermos's mouth eight or nine times within 24 hours, so it's no wonder that the heat inside gradually dissipated.</p>
<p>Mr. × sighed and said from the side:</p>
<p>Treat all catchphrases like this.</p>
<p>Mr. A and Mr. B asked the reason, Mr. × said:</p>
<p>Long-term resistance, not losing an inch of land, is a catchphrase in the political world.</p>
<p>A patriotic heart, not daring to fall behind, henceforth not buying enemy goods, is a catchphrase in the business world.</p>
<p>Sleeping on brushwood and tasting gall, returning my rivers and mountains, focusing on military training, vowing to avenge the country's shame, is a catchphrase in the academic world.</p>
<p>Pillowing on spears and awaiting orders, acting swiftly, any sacrifice, vowing not to submit, is a catchphrase in the military world hiding within the passes.</p>
<p>Opening your mouth once reduces the heat by one point; treat all catchphrases like this.</p>
<p>Political world, business world, academic world, and the military world hiding within the passes, I advise you to preserve the temperature in your thermos, do not open the thermos mouth frequently, turning the hot water inside into cold water.</p>

<p>丨Enough is Enough丨</p>
<p>Hope is a harlot, she is indulgent and passionate. Her beautiful face attracts the love and admiration of countless people. Her alluring smile bewitches the crazy worshippers around her. She uses her innate magic to control everyone's heart, making everyone willing to devote all their energy to her, even throwing away their precious lives. However, she is not a woman faithful to love after all. She has no chastity, no fixed rationality, no pure love. Her deceptive tricks are very clever, and no man who chases her can obtain final satisfaction.</p>
<p>After I turned a foreign writer's clever metaphor into the paragraph above, I feel that the writer's words are ultimately profound and widely applicable, and in today's China, can't we find countless examples? But at the same time, I also feel that hope's ability to guide people upwards is always indelible. Who doesn't have hope? What career success has not been encouraged by hope? However, in China, which is addicted to hope, hope has truly become a dangerous harlot.</p>
<p>Obviously, the entire Chinese nation is now immersed in a dream-like life of hope. The government authorities hope that the League of Nations will uphold justice, hope that the United States will maintain the dignity of the Nine-Power Treaty, and hope that the Shenyang Incident will have the same outcome as the Jinan Incident. Ordinary people hope that Japan will [collapse on its own,] hope for a Japanese-American war, a Japanese-Russian war, hope that a true Son of Heaven will be born, hope that a sword immortal or flying general will descend from the sky and kill hundreds of thousands of Japanese soldiers. In short, there is no longer any element of self-awareness and self-confidence in the national consciousness. Fated thoughts have occupied this large nation. Everyone lacks a positive understanding of the facts. When we saw the best-selling of books like Tui Bei Tu and Shao Bing Ge during the Shanghai war, we can know how our nation's life is trapped in the circle of hope.</p>
<p>Indulging in hope leads to fantasy and unwillingness to think of practical solutions. Even if there are solutions, there is a lack of strong will to implement them. This is a sign of the nation's lack of self-confidence. This is a symbol of the nation's morbid state. This alone is enough to destroy China. Therefore, I believe that China's danger lies not in the current national crisis, but in the deformed national morbid life. I hope everyone can remember the words of this foreign writer, and all difficulties can naturally be eliminated under a firm and resolute spirit.</p>

<p>丨Labor-Capital Cooperation Increases Production丨</p>
<p>The National Products Exhibition in this city has been open for several days at the Penglai Market in Nanshi. Its publicity methods, as well as the post office's stamping of the [Encourage the Use of National Products] stamp on letters, are all very enthusiastic, enough to awaken the deaf and inspire people. Here are some of my observations from the exhibition:</p>
<p>On the opening day, the number of guests and visitors from all walks of life reached more than 10,000. In the days that followed, it was still crowded. It is estimated that more than 200 manufacturers participated, displaying more than 4,000 commodities, a dazzling array of beautiful things. Among them, there are many kinds of goods that are equal to foreign goods in terms of quality and price, showing the rapid development of national industry in recent years, and proving that the Chinese people have long paid close attention to local products. Most of the goods listed in the exhibition were daily necessities, followed by food and beverages, and then educational supplies, all of which were able to compete with foreign goods. However, many important imported goods, such as newsprint, rayon, thin paper used for printing, dry plates used for photography, and utensils, were missing from domestic products. Chemical products, scientific instruments, high-quality woolen fabrics, etc., were also not common. This is partly because our country's scientific level is still difficult to catch up with advanced countries, and partly because the domestic situation has been turbulent, disasters have spread everywhere, the economy has been exhausted, funds have been difficult, and labor-capital disputes have frequently occurred in various factories, resulting in national industry facing thorns. It is hoped that our country's entrepreneurs, capitalists, and the labor world will work hard in this difficult time: not to be discouraged by the dangerous environment, but to eliminate prejudices and strive for cooperation. As for the government, it should fulfill its responsibility to protect and encourage new industries, so that the future of national products may be bright and splendid!</p>
<p>The exhibition hall is divided into two parts, north and south. The one located in the north is the first exhibition hall, and the one located in the south is the second exhibition hall. Various national products are mostly placed in glass cabinets, in an orderly manner. Moreover, the arrangement is winding and winding, which contains a lot of beautification, so that the audience has the opportunity to appreciate each item. In the second exhibition hall, the most eye-catching and amazing thing for the audience is the Lighthouse brand foam fire extinguisher produced by the Xin Guang Chemical Industry Company. This machine is divided into four types: fire-fighting type, standard type, boat and car type, and portable type, all of which are made of thin steel plate, and the compound is applied in the middle to ensure that the medicine and the machine do not have chemical reactions. The exterior is also coated with new-style paint and equipped with chromium covers, which are bright and eye-catching. A few weeks ago, it was publicly performed in Nanshi and was praised by various fire brigades and audiences. This is enough to add a different color to the national product world.</p>
<p>It is said that Mr. Zhang Qiuchong, the editor of the short-message magazine Wansui, readers say that he can get the true meaning of the three words [True] [Beauty] [Good]. The sixth issue has been published on the 16th. In addition to the five long articles by Haiming, Chunfan, Xunzi, Zhuo Dai, and Qiuchong, and the continuous [Two Sisters], [Evolution of Shanghai Brothels], [Nonsense], and [Shanghai in the Last Ten Years] and other famous works, there are more than ten masterpieces by Xiaodie, Ban Kuang, and Yiyun, which are exceptionally valuable. It is heard that the company is continuing to solicit 10,000 subscribers to commemorate the expansion, and subscribing to the whole year before the end of the month will only cost five yuan.</p>

<p>— Seeking Happiness Studio Owner</p>
<p>On the night of September 18th, the entire city of Shenyang, ×yang City, was easily occupied by the Japanese army. The family heard that Japanese soldiers were killing Chinese people on the streets and alleys outside with guns and bayonets, so they closed the doors tightly, and no one dared to go out. Tong Yizhen's uncle could no longer look for Deputy Commander Gao and Commander Li to scout out how the conspiracy to harm his niece was going to be carried out. As for these two commanders and one deputy commander, two dignified Chinese military men, they were extremely well-informed about important news concerning their lives. They had already heard that the Japanese were going to severely punish the old regime and would not allow them to live in power again, so they quickly took to their heels and abandoned some of the ready-made property in the official residence, took off the tiger-skin military uniform, and disguised themselves as miserable coolies. They dared not take cars anymore, so they walked to Huanggu Village, took a third-class car on the Beining Railway, and hid inside Shanhaiguan with the general refugees. Anyway, they could still live a carefree life in Tianjin, and there might even be better women to play with. There was no need to stubbornly occupy Tong's female student as their fifth concubine, and they easily and easily forgot about Tong Yizhen, just as they forgot about their ancestors' tombs, mulberry and elm home in the three northeastern provinces.</p>
<p>This was to Tong Yizhen's advantage, and she was able to turn danger into safety and eliminate the imminent disaster. Moreover, through this difficult and solid union, she and Lu Boqin measured the true height of each other's love, and the height of their love also increased to the boiling point, becoming even more harmonious than before.</p>
<p>It's just that the current situation is too pessimistic, and their environment is still depressing and bad. Since the Japanese army occupied Shenyang and other parts of the Northeast, it has created a very terrifying world. Residents flocked to the pass, and almost nine out of ten well-off families moved away. Those who were burdened by poverty and could not move could only close their doors and sit at home trembling and waiting for death. They no longer dared to walk on the streets. The park outside Xiaoxibianmen was full of Japanese soldiers, and the Wanquan River seemed to be separated by a planet. There were checkpoints along the way, and the corpses of those killed by Japanese soldiers' guns and bayonets were piled up, so no one dared to risk going there to visit. At this time, it was difficult for this pair of lovers to continue to seek a place to meet in the morning and evening. They had no good place to go, so they had to continue to make secret appointments and still hold a hasty open-air meeting in a quiet place in the lane. Although Tong's uncle and aunt no longer hindered Yizhen's freedom of action, they only urged her out of kindness not to run around and cause trouble.</p>

<h3 id="e125">Provisional Municipal Council <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Councilors Inaugurated Yesterday</p>
<p>Chu Minyi Represents the Central Government to Supervise the Oath</p>
<p>First Consultation Meeting Held Immediately</p>
<p>Previously, the Municipal Government, in accordance with the provisions of the Municipal Organization Law, should have established a Municipal Council. However, the autonomous elections were still in progress, and all of the city's reconstruction projects urgently needed to be carried out. The public opinion organ was extremely urgent. Therefore, Mayor Wu and Central Committee Member Chu Minyi jointly proposed to the Central Standing Committee to establish a Provisional Municipal Council to meet the current needs, which was subsequently approved. Organizational regulations were promulgated, and the mayor recommended to the Executive Yuan to appoint Yu Qiaqing and nineteen others as councilors. These matters have been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. Now, the Provisional Municipal Council was officially established yesterday morning at the Foreign Affairs Building in Fenglin Bridge. The grand occasion of its establishment ceremony is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Venue Arrangement: The Foreign Affairs Building was specially decorated with two arches of pine and cypress and colored decorations, erected high at the outer entrance and the main entrance of the office. Two plaques were hung horizontally, adorned with phrases,</p>
<p>one saying [Spirit of Democracy] and the other saying [Promote Public Opinion]. At the entrance of the office, signing tables were set up on both sides. The room on the left was for receiving guests. Upstairs was the grand auditorium, with a portrait of Sun Yat-sen hanging in the middle, with the Kuomintang and national flags crossed on either side. On both sides of the podium were Chinese and Western recording desks. More than two hundred seats were arranged in a circular shape. The seats on the left were for the councilors, and the seats on the right were for guests from the municipal government and various agencies. The remaining seats were for guests. The venue was decorated with balloons, creating a very solemn and beautiful atmosphere. When the guests arrived, Mayor Wu Tiecheng led the municipal government staff to warmly receive them. The Municipal Public Security Bureau dispatched police to maintain order at the venue. The Municipal Public Security Bureau music band played music at the venue.</p>
<p>Guests Attending: Yesterday morning at nine o'clock, in front of the Foreign Affairs Building in Fenglin Bridge, there was heavy traffic. Guests and councilors arrived one after another. Among them were Central Committee Member Chu Minyi, the oath supervisor sent by the Central Government and the Executive Yuan; Pan Gongzhan, representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters; representatives from the Garrison Headquarters, Jianghai Customs, the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Second Special District Local Court, the China Merchants Bureau Supervisory Office, the Bank Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and the Municipal Guoshu (National Martial Arts) Museum; and Mayor Wu of the Municipal Government, Secretary-General Yu, heads of various bureaus, various staff members, and chiefs of various districts of the Public Security Bureau, totaling no fewer than four or five hundred people.</p>
<p>Councilors Attending: Fourteen councilors attended, including Wang Yiting, Shi Zuicai, Du Yuesheng, Wu Jingxiong, Wu Yugan, Chen Guangfu, Qin Runqing, and Liu Zhanen. Five councilors were absent: Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, Li Ming, Chen Bingqian, and Qian Xinzhi. Li Ming went to Nanyang on business, Qian Xinzhi was ill, and Chen Bingqian was busy with affairs. Wang Xiaolai and Wang Yansong were summoned to Wuhan by Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. Yesterday, the two sent a telegram to the council, requesting Yu Qiaqing and Qin Runqing to represent them. The telegram read: "To the Shanghai Municipal Government, transferred to the gentlemen of the Municipal Council, Xiaolai was summoned to Hankou and has not been able to fly back to attend the council inauguration. Please Elder Yu Qiao represent. Please Brother Qin Runqing represent. Xiaolai and Song respectfully kowtow."</p>
<p>Proceedings of the Meeting: At ten o'clock in the morning, the meeting was convened with the ringing of a bell. First, the Municipal Council elected Yu Qiaqing as the temporary chairman. The ceremony was as follows: (1) Music; (2) Chairman takes his seat, oath supervisor takes his seat; (4) Councilors take their seats; (5) Guests take their seats; (6) Sing the Kuomintang song; (7) Bow three times to the Kuomintang flag and the portrait of Sun Yat-sen; (8) Chairman respectfully reads Sun Yat-sen's will; (9) Silent tribute; (10) Chairman delivers the opening address; (11) Councilors take the oath; (12) Oath supervisor delivers an instruction speech; (13) Representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters delivers a speech; (14) Mayor delivers a speech; (15) Guests deliver speeches; (16) Councilors deliver a response speech; (17) Music; (18) Ceremony concludes.</p>
<p>Chairman's Address: Chairman Yu Qiaqing's speech briefly stated: "Today is the day of the inauguration of the Provisional Municipal Council. We are honored to have a representative from the Central Government to supervise the oath, and representatives from various agencies and organizations to participate in the ceremony. We are deeply honored. We hope to receive much guidance in the future. Our city is in a prime location and its situation is different from other provinces and cities. Shanghai is not only a commercial center and a diplomatic center, but also a center of world opinion. Considering the development process of Shanghai, the initial revenue was less than 300,000 taels. In the era of Lu Yongxiang, it was only 700,000. After the establishment of the Municipal Government, due to the rectification and planning of successive mayors, the Municipal treasury revenue has been nearly 10 million. Although some were destroyed by the war this spring, it is still the leading city in the country. We are recommended by the mayor and will do our best to assist the mayor to make all the construction of this city more perfect, comparable to major cities in Europe and the United States."</p>
<p>Oath Supervisor's Address: Chu Minyi's oath supervision speech briefly stated: "Mayor, councilors, guests, today the councilors of the Shanghai Provisional Municipal Council are holding an oath-taking ceremony. I represent the Central Government and the Executive Yuan to supervise the oath, and I feel exceptionally honored and very happy. Shanghai is a major international trading port, and its international reputation is at stake. Its importance surpasses that of all other parts of the country. Unfortunately, since the January 28 Incident, the Jiangwan and Zhabei areas have been completely destroyed by artillery fire. It is extremely painful to mention. In the era of former Mayor Zhang Yuejun, there was already a plan for a Greater Shanghai. Since Mayor Wu took office, he has been working hard to continue the process and will see it implemented in stages. Therefore, I discussed with Mayor Wu and proposed to the Central Government to establish the Shanghai Provisional Municipal Council. The councilors are all outstanding talents of the time and are appointed by the Municipal Government. This is because Shanghai's position is so important and construction is urgent and cannot be delayed. Therefore, it is impossible to manage without collective efforts. Today, the Provisional Municipal Council has been established, and the councilors have taken office. I sincerely hope that they will work hard to serve and directly seek happiness for the citizens of the entire city, and indirectly benefit the country. In the future, after the Greater Shanghai plan is realized, I will celebrate with you all."</p>
<p>Representative's Speech: Pan Gongzhan, representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, gave a speech, briefly stating: "I represent the Municipal Party Headquarters to offer a few words. First, all municipal councilors are leaders from all walks of life in this city. Today, they have accepted the invitation of the mayor and the Central Government to take the oath of office here, and they must be very clear about their duties. According to the provisions of the Municipal Organization Law, each city should have a Municipal Council. However, the formal Municipal Council must be produced by election. The Provisional Municipal Council is recommended by the mayor and appointed by the Executive Yuan. Although the name and method of production are different, their powers are the same. The Municipal Party Headquarters believes that the so-called party governance is only a means of the transitional period. The ultimate goal is of course not democratic governance, but to achieve democratic governance from party governance, we must go through various procedures step by step. The Provisional Municipal Council can be said to be the public opinion organ of the transitional period before the formal Municipal Council is produced. As for the powers, they are exactly the same. I sincerely hope that all councilors will exercise the special powers given to them and represent the citizens to contribute suggestions that are beneficial to the citizens to the Municipal Government. Second, some people say that the so-called public opinion organ should be produced by election. Now, the Provisional Municipal Council is established because of the government's appointment. Can it represent public opinion? According to the Municipal Party Headquarters, the so-called public opinion refers to the entire, non-class-based, and clear public opinion, not the meaning of a specific elector. The original intention of the election is nothing more than to trust their personality and knowledge, and they can represent public opinion. This time, the Municipal Government also trusts your knowledge and morality and can represent public opinion, so it is appointed as a councilor. Therefore, its role is no different from that of an elected person. Third, we can trust that you can be competent for this task when we look at your past careers, knowledge, experience, morality, and deeply admire Mayor Wu's vision in selecting and appointing people. At the same time, among you, there are people from the banking industry, industrialists, scholars, journalists, lawyers, accountants, and other self-employed people. Not only do you have the ability and experience, but you are all local leaders who are trusted. Mayor Wu has actually recruited all of you. Therefore, the mayor's selection of councilors can be said to be meticulous. This Provisional Municipal Council will surely represent the entire public opinion. I believe that if the method of voting is used to elect people, it may not be possible to recruit leaders from all walks of life in one place. Furthermore, in recent years, there have been many malpractices in the election system. Since you are invited, your integrity is incomparable to those who are elected through sports elections. I would like to represent the Municipal Party Headquarters to wish you a bright future."</p>
<p>Mayor's Address: "Oath Supervisor, councilors, guests, fellow citizens of Shanghai, the three million citizens have been eagerly hoping for the early establishment of a public opinion organ, so that the reconstruction of Shanghai can be realized as soon as possible and the happiness of the three million citizens can be sought. The Municipal Government colleagues follow the three million citizens and also hope that the public opinion organ can be realized as soon as possible, so that the various policies of this city can be consulted and there can be a guideline. Today, it can actually be realized. This is not only a happy thing for the Municipal Government colleagues, but also a happy thing for the citizens of the entire city. Since the January 28 Incident, most of the construction projects in Shanghai have been destroyed, suffering unprecedented losses. If we want to restore the old appearance and build a more prosperous situation than before, it will not be possible without the concerted efforts of the citizens and the government. As for what method we should use to show that all the citizens and the Municipal Government are working together, only the method of the Municipal Council can express this spirit and convey public opinion. However, the formal Municipal Council must have considerable procedures and a considerable period of time before it can be established. The suffering of the citizens of Shanghai after the war and the urgency of the reconstruction project cannot be delayed until the establishment of this formal Municipal Council. Therefore, for emergency purposes, there is a proposal to the Central Government to establish a Provisional Municipal Council. However, we respect the Provisional Municipal Council as much as the formal Municipal Council. We hope that the councilors will work together with one heart and one mind to assist the Municipal Government colleagues, relieve the people's suffering, and meet the needs of the citizens. I would like to express my sincere respect to the councilors on the day of the establishment of the Provisional Municipal Council."</p>
<p>Guest Speech: Lin Kanghou, representative of the guests, gave a speech: "The establishment of the Provisional Municipal Council today fully demonstrates the cooperation between the Municipal Government and the citizens. From now on, all public opinions can be conveyed by this council to the Municipal Government. I would like to represent the citizens to congratulate Mayor Wu and the councilors on the successful cooperation and the early realization of Greater Shanghai, and the early elimination of the suffering of the citizens. At the same time, I would like to quote a few sentences from the Four Books as a contribution. The Four Books say, 'Those who produce are many, those who consume are few, those who work are quick, and those who use are thrifty, then wealth will always be sufficient.' I deeply feel that if we want to make the city prosperous, the first thing we must do is to make everyone have a job. The so-called 'those who produce are many' is right. The excessive taxes and miscellaneous levies on the people should be reduced as much as possible. This is the so-called 'those who consume are few' is right. 'Those who work are quick, and those who use are thrifty' means that finance should be based on income and expenditure. The result of the economic panic in European and American countries is to abandon the policy of basing expenditure on income and instead create a system of basing expenditure on income, which leads to financial difficulties and heavy taxes on the people. This is not the way to govern. I hope that the Municipal Council will follow this principle in the future and cooperate with the Municipal Government at any time. Even if there are things that want to increase the burden on the people, please make it public so that the citizens know the ins and outs of the municipal administration. If everything can be made public, so as to achieve the effect of cooperation between the government and the people, then the future will be really reliable."</p>
<p>Councilor's Response: The Municipal Councilors' representative responded, "I have just heard the instructions from the oath supervisor, the mayor, and the guests. We are very admirable and will definitely encourage ourselves in the future to cooperate with the mayor to achieve the completion of the construction of Greater Shanghai. On behalf of all the councilors, I would like to thank you all."</p>
<p>Holding a Consultation Meeting: After the Municipal Councilors finished their response, the ceremony was completed in the melodious sound of music, followed by refreshments and photography. After the photography, all the councilors gathered in the conference room on the left side of the Foreign Affairs Building to convene the first consultation meeting. It was decided to convene a formal meeting next week to elect the speaker, etc.</p>

<p>Financial Minister Song Ziwen, in view of the severe drop in rice prices and the impending bankruptcy of the rural economy, was eager to find ways to provide relief. He convened a Civil Food Conference in Beijing on the fifth of this month. The proceedings of the meeting and Song's speech have been reported in the previous newspaper. Now, because the issue of grain storage still needs to be thoroughly discussed with the Shanghai financial community, he sent Yuan Timing, Director of the Taxation Department, and Shen Shuyu, Director of the Customs Administration, to Shanghai to invite leaders from the Silver and Money Industries Association and local associations to a luncheon at the Bank Club at No. 4 Hong Kong Road at 12:00 noon on the 17th. During the meeting, Director Yuan reported on the progress of the Civil Food Conference and hoped that the financial community would notify their respective branch offices to maximize loans secured by grain in order to provide relief. Shi Liangcai, Zhang Gongquan, Qin Runqing, Chen Jianan, and others spoke in succession, unanimously expressing their agreement with the loan matter and raising several points such as organizing a civil food regulating agency, implementing a grain storage policy, and reducing domestic grain freight and taxes to facilitate circulation, which coincided with the Civil Food Conference's proposal. Yuan responded to each point and expressed his sincere acceptance. The host and guests parted on good terms. After the meeting, it was heard that Yuan and Shen went to Qiqi Road to report to Minister Song in detail.</p>

<p>Telegraphing National Party Headquarters</p>
<p>Leading Subordinate Merchant Groups to Organize Collectively</p>
<p>Lanzhou and Jiangba Chambers of Commerce Telegraph to Participate</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Municipal League of Nations Covenant Support Committee has been working tirelessly. In addition to sending representatives to Zhejiang Province and various ports along the Longhai Railway to negotiate the organization of branch associations, in order to actively proceed, it has telegraphed party headquarters across the country, requesting them to lead subordinate merchant groups to organize branch associations collectively to strengthen unity. The association yesterday also received telegrams from the Lanzhou Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Anhui Jiangba Chamber of Commerce, agreeing with its propositions and participating in the organization. The association's telegram is recorded as follows: "To the party headquarters of all provinces, cities, and counties, sincerely regretting that since the September 18 Incident, when the violent Japanese occupied the Northeast, and the January 28 attack on Shanghai, disregarding international faith, disrupting world peace, and stubbornly acting willfully and invading, they have recently been conducting puppet organizations and rejecting third-party mediation. Such vicious and sinister actions cannot be included in the ranks of international faith. However, the covenant is sacred, and so is the individual. How can the country allow it to be destroyed? We are saddened by the loss of our country's territory and fear the destruction of the covenant. Therefore, the guilds and associations of various industries in Shanghai have organized the League of Nations Covenant Support Committee, based on the principle of freedom of trade for merchants, adopting the economic blockade method of Article 16 of the covenant, vowing to sever all economic relations with Japan, which is destroying the covenant. However, this matter is of great importance and depends on collective efforts. If the whole country can unite as one, it can also achieve the final success. In addition to telegraphing all chambers of commerce and industry associations across the country to unanimously advocate and sending personnel to organize branch associations in various places, we hereby telegraph your department again, requesting you to lead subordinate merchant groups to organize and recommend representatives to participate in our association to strengthen unity. The future of the party and the country is deeply dependent on it. The telegram is urgent, and we await your clear instructions. Attached is the telegram from the Lanzhou Municipal Chamber of Commerce: "To the Shanghai League of Nations Covenant Support Committee, we have just received Mr. Jiang's telegram. We respectfully acknowledge that your association is actively working hard, based on the principle of freedom of trade, adhering to the merchants' principle of self-determination, to support the League of Nations. The ultimate goal will definitely be achieved. Although our association is located in a remote area, we have enthusiasm. In addition to agreeing, we have telegraphed to join. Lanzhou Municipal Chamber of Commerce kowtows."</p>

<h3 id="e129">Communist Leader Chen Duxiu and Others Arrested <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Broken After Two Days and Nights of Searching</p>
<p>Chen and Eleven Others All Sent to the Public Security Bureau</p>
<p>Among the Communists, there is a so-called Trotskyist faction, which organized the Youth League Committee in Shanghai, electing five committee members to handle party affairs. Chen Duxiu is the leader of this group, giving instructions and commands. The party members all follow his lead. The committee stipulated that a standing meeting should be held once a week. Recently, Chen, due to his weak health, has been represented by Xie Shaoshan in every meeting and guidance work. The authorities, considering that the party is engaged in the exclusive dissemination of communist propaganda and that Du Xiu has long been wanted by the government, strictly ordered the police to secretly investigate and arrest them to curb the chaos. Recently, the Municipal Public Security Bureau discovered that Chen and important members of the party were hiding in various places in the Public Concession and the French Concession. The Bureau Chief Wen Hongen consulted the First Special District Local Court and issued search warrants and arrest warrants, dispatching detectives from the political department of the General Inspectorate and Chinese and Western detectives from the Jiaxing Road Police Station to start operations at 2:30 PM on the 15th (last Saturday). After two days and nights, until the night of the 16th, all the famous figures of the party were captured. The seized communist propaganda documents and books were too numerous to be counted. It can be said to be the first major case since the purge of the Communists. The destruction of various agencies and the interrogation situation are described below:</p>
<p>Five People Arrested in Chunyangli: At 2:30 PM last Saturday, Chinese and Western detectives, with court search warrants and arrest warrants, first went to No. 210 Chunyangli, Dongyouheng Road, and arrested five people: Xie Shaoshan (22 years old) from Guangdong, Wang Zhaoqun (27 years old) from Anhui, Zhang Cinan (34 years old) from Hunan, Pu Yifan (28 years old) from Anhui, and Wang Wu (35 years old) from Hebei. 106 documents and 34 kinds of Russian communist books were seized and taken back to the Jiaxing Road Police Station for detention. Among these five people, Zhang Cinan's original name was Peng Shuzhi, and it was heard that Xie Shaoshan's other name was Xie Depei.</p>
<p>Chen Duxiu's Appearance: After the search in Chunyangli, they went to No. 11 Yongjili, Yuezhou Road, to search. Chen Duxiu was alone in the room. The detectives immediately arrested him and seized many communist documents in Chinese, Japanese, and Russian in his room. Chen was also taken to the police station. Chen is from Anhui, 54 years old this year. He is very thin due to illness, with a slight beard on his lips and slightly gray hair. He was wearing a light blue serge long gown and a light yellow felt hat. After being detained in the police station, the head of the police inquired about his illness and sent a detective to the Public Works Department hospital. The doctor diagnosed that his illness was not very serious and that he could be interrogated.</p>
<p>Searching Pu's Residence: After Pu Yifan, Secretary-General and Translator of China Merchants Avoiding Secrets, was arrested in Chunyangli, the police station found out that he lived at No. 222 Gaofuli, Avenue Notre Dame, French Concession. The detectives rushed to the French police station to request assistance and went to Pu's home with the French detectives to search. More than 30 kinds of communist documents were found and taken back to the police station.</p>
<p>Western Police Jumping Out of Windows to Chase: At 11:00 PM on the 15th, Chinese and Western detectives secretly went to No. 1044 Siwenli, Xinzha Grand Avenue, to ambush the remaining party members. A Guangxi person, Liang Youguang, was arrested. Two others jumped out of the window of their room to escape. A Western policeman from a certain house also jumped out of the window to chase and eventually caught Wang Xiaochun (30 years old) from Anhui. The other person escaped without a trace. 28 documents were seized in the room and Liang and Wang were taken back to the police station for strict detention.</p>
<p>Continuing the Search the Next Day: Police station detectives continued to work the next day from morning to evening. First, they went to No. 335 Yeguangli, Tangshan Road, and arrested Wang Ziping and He Afang, two people from Wenzhou. 78 kinds of Russian documents were seized. Then, they went to No. 22 Jianyeli, Fuxuli Road, French Concession, and arrested Wang Jiantang, a person from Shandong. 10 documents and books and a piece of carbon paper were seized. The paper had only been used once, and the handwriting was still recognizable, all of which were communist propaganda words. Then, they went to No. 532 Xiudeli, Baker Road, to search. The person living in the house had already fled after hearing the news, leaving a note in the room. The words written were to notify the party members that the agency in a certain place had been destroyed and not to go there again. In addition, eight documents were also seized. There were also three places where the gangs had been: No. 284 Avenue Joffre, No. 3 Shanjili, East Jiaxing Road, and a certain number of Baker Road No. 394 Lane. When they went to search, they had all escaped in advance and left nothing behind. Therefore, there was nothing to be found in these three places.</p>
<p>Indictment of Defendants: Yesterday morning, the police station escorted Chen Duxiu and the other eleven people who had been arrested one after another to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. Various documents and books were also transported to the court by car. Judge Zhao Zhengcheng then took the seat in the First Tribunal to propose the case. In order to make it easier for the court to understand the case, the police station attached numbers to the chests of each defendant. For example, Chen Duxiu was No. 6 when he was arrested, so he was attached with the number 6 as the sixth defendant. Because Chen was ill, he was allowed to sit. The police station lawyer Li Zhishan described the process of solving the case and said that the indictment was based on Article 2, Paragraph 2 of the Emergency Law on Punishing Acts Endangering the Republic of China and Article 6 of the same law.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Defendant Chen Duxiu had been punished by the former French Concession police twice in the French Concession in the 11th and 13th years of the Republic of China for propagating Bolshevism, with a fine of 100 yuan for the first time and 400 yuan for the second time. Wang Zhaoqun had been punished in the 18th year for a case. Wang Wu had also been arrested and sent to the Garrison Headquarters for interrogation in a communist case. Now, it is still necessary to investigate and request a change of date.</p>
<p>Public Security Bureau Requests Transfer: The representative of the Municipal Public Security Bureau went to court and said, "Chen Duxiu, one of the defendants in this case, is an important criminal wanted by the government. Whether the police station prosecutes this person or not, they must be allowed to be transferred to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation and handling, because all the major cases he committed were in the mainland and he lived in the concession, relying on it as a talisman. Xie Shaoshan is also requested to be transferred to the bureau for interrogation and then sent back to your court, and it is requested to prohibit spectators from attending." The police station lawyer declared that they did not object to the temporary transfer of Xie Shaoshan to the bureau for interrogation.</p>
<p>Secret Interrogation of Defendants: Judge Zhao, considering that the confessions of the defendants were extremely important in this case and could not be leaked, immediately announced a ban on spectators and ordered all the defendants to be taken to the waiting room for separate interrogation. It was not over by noon, so he ordered Xie Shaoshan to be handed over to the Public Security Bureau personnel to take away first.</p>
<p>The Police Station Withdraws the Prosecution: At 2:00 PM, Judge Zhao opened the First Tribunal again to continue the separate interrogation. First, Li Zhishan of the police station declared that, after investigation, it had been found that some of the defendants had not committed all the crimes in the concession. For the convenience of investigation and interrogation, the police station requested permission to withdraw the prosecution. The police station did not object to the transfer of all defendants as requested by the Municipal Public Security Bureau.</p>
<p>Public Security Bureau Requests Transfer: The lawyer representing the Public Security Bureau solemnly declared again that many of the defendants had been wanted by the government. Now that the police station has requested to withdraw the prosecution, they should be transferred to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation and handling in accordance with the agreement. Judge Zhao then interrogated each of the defendants who had not been interrogated one by one. It was exactly 4:30, so he temporarily retired from the court.</p>
<p>Ruling Granting Transfer: At 5:00, Criminal Tribunal President Yu Hua, Judge Zhao Zhengcheng, and Guo Huaipu, together with the prosecutor, convened a conference court. After the police station lawyer and the Public Security Bureau lawyer sequentially stated the course of events, the prosecutor then stood up and argued that since the police station had withdrawn the prosecution, the Public Security Bureau should take them away in accordance with the agreement. President Yu declared that Chen Duxiu and the other eleven people would be handed over to the personnel from the Municipal Public Security Bureau to take away for interrogation and handling.</p>
<p>Defendants Express Opinions: The defendants stood up and protested after hearing the ruling. Wang Xiaochun, Pu Yifan, and Liang Youguang spoke the most. Chen Duxiu only spoke a few words, but it can be said to be concise and comprehensive. What they argued was all legal issues, expressing their unwillingness to have the case transferred to the Public Security Bureau. President Yu earnestly instructed that this transfer procedure was handled in accordance with the agreement, and even if an appeal was made, it could not stop the execution of this ruling. The defendants continued to argue, speaking one after another, which took a long time. The court thought that it was a waste of time and effort, and it was difficult to expect them to understand. Therefore, when the clock struck six, the court was adjourned, and the personnel from the Public Security Bureau escorted the defendants, along with the seized documents and books, into cars and took them to the bureau for interrogation and handling.</p>

<p>Korean Party Members in Shanghai Plot</p>
<p>The New Voice Society reports that the righteous armies outside the customs have been very active recently. The Korean Independence Party in this city, considering the organization of Sino-Korean joint forces in the three eastern provinces, and to permanently maintain the Sino-Korean joint anti-Japanese work, held a special meeting to discuss assistance. They are actively engaged in various activities in Shanghai. The detailed information obtained is as follows:</p>
<p>Yesterday Evening's Meeting: Key members of the party convened an emergency meeting at a certain location last night, attended by many relevant personnel from various parties. During the meeting, they discussed methods to assist the Sino-Korean Allied Forces. The following four points were resolved: (1) Organize a special task force, divided into general teams, sub-teams, and small teams. Party members who are familiar with the situation in the Northeast will be added to the organization and dispatched after temporary training to various locations in Manchuria to disrupt the enemy's rear. (2) Dispatch several important cadres to various parts of Korea to publicize the atrocities of the Japanese army, to unite important personnel from all parties to promote a full-scale Korean anti-Japanese revolution, and to seek the independence of Korea. (3) Find ways to provide military expenses to the Sino-Korean Allied Forces, which will be planned by the cadres in Shanghai. (4) Send telegrams to the frontline soldiers to express condolences and encourage them to strive to fight a decisive battle with the brutal Japanese.</p>
<p>Frontline Telegram: The Independence Party received a war telegram from the Sino-Korean Allied Forces Office in Korea the night before last, which stated (the above is omitted): Tang Juwu's troops, commander of the Liaodong Righteous Army, and Li Qingchen's Korean Independence Army, jointly formed the Sino-Korean Anti-Japanese Allied Army, and fought fiercely for days against the Hattori Brigade dispatched urgently from the Korean side, and the Omura Battalion of the Japanese Kwantung Army. The enemy army dispatched troops from Jilin, South Manchuria, and the Yalu River in three directions to encircle the Allied Forces. Li Lingran, the commander-in-chief of the first route of the Allied Forces, broke through the encirclement and fought a bloody battle with the Japanese army's Hattori. The enemy army was defeated and the Hattori Brigade completely collapsed. The enemy army's encirclement plan thus failed.</p>

<p>The China United News Agency's Local News: Yan Bowen's letter to the China United News Agency reads: "To the China United News Agency, which forwards to all Chinese and foreign newspapers: We have received a telegram from Li Siru, the commander of our army's military committee and the commander of the second route, Li Haifeng, forwarded from Yuguan, which reads: [Shanghai urgently forwards to Brother Yan Bowen, the representative of the Rehe National Anti-Japanese Salvation Army stationed in Shanghai: Since we received the order from Chairman He and Deputy Chairman Zhang to lead our troops towards Yixian by different routes, we have been in intense contact with the enemy in the vicinity of Majiatai, Liulongtai, Jiushaoguokou, Beiyingzi, and Beipiao for several days. Fortunately, our army's morale is very high. In the battle of Majiatai, over two hundred enemies were killed. In the battle of Liulongtai, over one hundred enemies were killed. In Jiushaoguokou and Beiyingzi, over three hundred enemies were killed. One armored car and a large number of military supplies were captured. According to statistics, we lost five battalion and company commanders and over one hundred soldiers. One regimental commander and over thirty soldiers were wounded. We are currently contacting friendly troops in Jinxi to launch a general attack on Yixian. However, the enemy has recently used the Ishimoto Incident to try to communicate with our army, but has been strictly rejected. We are deeply concerned that rumors from afar are inaccurate, or that our army's actions are misunderstood. Therefore, this telegram is sent to be published immediately. The rest will be reported later. Li Siru, Li Haifeng, etc., respectfully kowtow.]" It is appropriate to forward this and hope that it will be published to promote public friendship. Yan Bowen, the representative of the Rehe National Anti-Japanese Salvation Army stationed in Shanghai, respectfully kowtows.</p>

It is heard that the Liaoning General Command has been established in Beiping, which was established by Mr. Zhu Ziqiao of the Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang Support Association together with the Northeast People's Anti-Japanese Salvation Association. Currently, military affairs and finance are valued for unity, and you can ask for help when you pass through Beiping. It is expected that they will be happy to assist.

It was mailed to Shanghai yesterday and properly handed over to the Northeast Support Association. The teachers and students of the school are truly the most patriotic.</p>

Whenever there is disaster relief in various parts of the country, he always donates a large amount, saving countless lives. Recently, he donated to the Northeast disaster victims, which were taken by Central Committee members Zhu Qiqing and General Zhu Qinglan for distribution, and achieved even better results. Many disaster victims who took the medicine were able to survive. Now that the medicine is said to be used up, Zhu and others telegraphed Mr. Hu in Hong Kong yesterday to request expedited delivery.

<p>Woman on the Verge of Death</p>
<p>Two Children Also Seriously Injured</p>
<p>After the January 28th Incident, a large number of cannons and bombs were left in the fields and streams in the northern suburbs of Shanghai, especially around Wusong Township. Ignorant villagers are often harmed. Yang, a local resident of Liujiazhai, west of Wusong Township, whose son, Xing Sheng, is 18 years old, went with his nephew, Gen Da (7 years old, to a nearby stream for a cold bath in mid-June of this summer. Not long after entering the water, they discovered a heavy object at the bottom of the bank, an 80-pound bomb. They carried it home and placed it indoors for four months. His mother, Gu, caught a glimpse of the heavy copper on both ends of the bomb, which was very valuable, and had long been coveting it. At 7:00 a.m. yesterday, she and her son, Xing Sheng, and nephew, Gen Da, held iron axes and struck at both ends of the bomb. Before long, there was a loud bang, and the bomb exploded. Gu was injured in her limbs, and her life could not be saved. She is on the verge of death. Xing Sheng was injured in his abdomen, and his fingers were completely destroyed. Only Gen Da was slightly injured. They were sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment by car.</p>

<p>Reporting the Begging for Aid</p>
<p>Since coming to Shanghai to beg for aid from the rear as a representative of the Fourth Route of the Liaoning Yitong Army, Yang Yijie has been in Shanghai for several decades and has repeatedly sent letters to the Volunteer Army Support Association to provide assistance. He also personally went to the association to request it. Later, the support association felt that the matter was important and did not want to provide assistance until a detailed investigation was made. A few days ago, Geng Jizhou, the commander-in-chief of the Fourth Route of the Liaoning Righteous Army, sent Cao Fengchun and Zhang Zhitian, two staff officers of the department, to Shanghai with a letter to the Volunteer Army Support Association to prove that Representative Yang was indeed dispatched by the department and hoped to provide assistance as soon as possible. After receiving the letter, the support association submitted it to the board meeting on (15) Saturday for discussion. It was decided to first telegraph Generals Zhu Ziqiao and Zhu Jiqing in the Northeast to inquire about the situation of the department. Yesterday afternoon, Representative Yang and staff officer Cao Fengchun went to the support association to inquire about the details. Yang Youren, the clerk of the association, received them and replied that the reply from the Northeast would arrive soon. After receiving the reply, another meeting will be convened to discuss the solution. Also, yesterday Representative Yang sent Representative Zhang Zhitian north first to report the begging for aid. It is heard that the representative set off last night.</p>

<p>Yesterday's Memorial Service for Zhang Jinlong Zhang Jinlong, a squad leader of the Shanghai South District Defense Corps in this city, bravely went out to defend against the Japanese during the Anti-Japanese War, overworked himself, and died. Mr. Ma Xiangbo, Dai Ji, and others initiated a memorial meeting, which has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, a memorial service was held at the headquarters of the Eighth Team, presided over by Vice Minister Zhao Jinqing. More than 200 guests attended, including Qu Wenliu, Chairman Zhang Bingxin, Yu Baoqing, and Zhu Shaoyi. At the ceremony, Huang Ruisheng, chairman of the association, reported the purpose, and Feng Runsheng, the team leader, announced Zhang Jinlong's deeds and respectfully read the memorial text. In addition, Vice Minister Zhao delivered a speech, saying that after the Northeast Incident, Zhang Jinlong joined the Defense Corps to do his best for the country. Those who cherish their lives would not do that. Therefore, his loyalty and courage are admirable, and his talent is naturally useful to the country. His death is very regrettable. Then, Chief Director Qu Wenliu delivered a speech, saying, "What is the reason for our memorial service for Mr. Zhang? Mr. Zhang died in the rear defense. When the whole country is fighting desperately against Japan, there is only the distinction of pointing the gun outwards. How can there be a reason for attacking the rear when the front line is fighting? This is a strange phenomenon that does not exist in other countries in the world. Therefore, Mr. Zhang's death in the rear is not worth it. We mourn Mr. Zhang and should sigh for the country." Finally, Zhu Shaoyi, Zhang Bingxin, Gu Zhujun, and others successively gave speeches. The meeting adjourned after 7 p.m.</p>

<p>Lida Academy Farm Opens Chicken Farming Practice Class Lida Academy in Jiangwan, this city, has been promoting production education for many years. It has established a farm in Jiangwan and a rural education department in Chaitang, Nanxiang, both of which have achieved remarkable results. This year, when the violent Japanese invaded, all the products and equipment of the academy's farm and all the production bases of the rural education department were almost completely destroyed. However, more than 2,000 fine breeding chickens raised on the farm were fortunately moved out by a quarter under the rain of bullets and transported to Wuxi, Jiaxing, and other places to be preserved. After the Japanese invaders withdrew, the academy worked hard to restore the farm, which is now焕然一新. Although the original chicken farm area has been slightly reduced due to the reduction in the number of chickens, there are still more than 500 fine breeding chickens that can be developed. At present, all parties feel that it is necessary to study, improve, and promote the chicken farming industry, and many people have requested to practice at the farm. In response to the needs of the situation, the farm has decided to open a chicken farming practice class to enable those interested in chicken farming to conduct practical research on the farm, which will surely greatly benefit the future rural economy.</p>

<p>Jiangsu Province Fresh Pig Industry Representatives Jointly Telegraph to Stop Forcible Collection of Taxes The Joint Association of Fresh Pig Industry Representatives in Jiangsu Province received an urgent letter from merchants in Xingang, Jiangbei yesterday, reporting that the Jingxing Business Tax Bureau sent police to forcibly collect taxes, and that if they did not pay, the ships and goods would be detained, causing public outrage. The association immediately telegraphed the Jingjiang County Chamber of Commerce to request the county government to stop it. The original telegram is as follows: Jingjiang County Chamber of Commerce, the Jingxing Business Tax Bureau sent police to forcibly collect pig taxes in Xingang. We are trying our best to argue with the superiors on this matter. Before it is resolved, please transfer the county to stop it to avoid accidents. Jiangsu Province Fresh Pig Industry Joint Association respectfully. At the same time, representatives from Jingjiang telegraphed the Pig Industry Association of the county, reporting the insistence on opposing the situation and suspending transportation to wait for a solution.</p>
<p>Hongkou Nanlu Request to Exempt Municipal Donations Unsuccessful Taxpayers Association Sends Letter to Public Works Bureau Yesterday The letter stated: In response to your letter of October 4, since the 28th, the authorities of the concession, in view of the difficulties of the people in the area, have reduced and exempted the spring municipal donations to regulate people's livelihoods. The law is very good. Our factory is located in the eastern district, adjacent to the trenches. The degree of disaster is deeper than other places. At that time, the rent problem had not been resolved, and there was no corresponding standard, so we temporarily paid one month of spring municipal donations to fulfill our tax obligations. Now that the rent dispute has been resolved and two months have been waived, we believe that the collection of municipal donations is purely based on rent. By analogy, the Public Works Bureau should also waive three months on this basis. Moreover, there is a precedent in Nanlufang, dozens of steps away from our factory. Therefore, we send this letter to your association and ask for your assistance, and hope that you will send a letter to the Public Works Bureau, requesting them to return the overcharged one month of spring municipal donations to alleviate the people's difficulties. After investigation, the Public Works Bureau of the Public Concession exempted the municipal donations in the Hongkou area for a maximum of three months and a minimum of one and a half months. The decision was made after careful consideration and negotiation. The original intention was to save the market, and there is no causal relationship between the exemption of rent or not. Moreover, the budget of the Public Works Bureau has a certain amount. This time, the general exemption of the municipal donations in the Hongkou area is a huge amount. Our association once asked for more exemption, but the answer was that reducing the burden of taxpayers in the Hongkou area would inevitably increase the burden of other taxpayers, which is very unfair. Our association cannot be biased towards taxpayers, so we also agree with this statement. There is another thing that can be told, that is, the owner, for the sake of rent exemption, once asked the Public Works Bureau to exempt land donations, but it was not approved. This situation should not be ignored. The above is the reason for the letter, and the attachments are enclosed for your reference.</p>
<p>Fuxing Zhabei Loan ▲Negotiations Have Been Substantially Concluded The Shanghai Municipal Government has decided to raise 5 million yuan to revitalize Zhabei in order to carry out the project.

<p>Yangzhengli Tenant Self-Government Association General Meeting The Yangzhengli Tenant Self-Government Association on Tangshan Road, Hongkou, held a general meeting of members yesterday at Ducaigong School. All tenants enthusiastically participated and said that the houses in the neighborhood were the estate of the late Ye Chengzhong of Shanghai. Since the buildings were built until last year, the monthly rent for each house was only about seven yuan. The newly set rent for each house is thirty-eight yuan. Although the tenants in the neighborhood have repeatedly sent representatives to request a reduction in rent, the negotiations have been going back and forth for several months with no result. The tenants had to unite as one. Yesterday, a special general meeting of members was held, with Chen Jiufeng elected as chairman and Yu Hanqiao as recorder. After the ritual, the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting (omitted). (1) Resolution on the minimum rent reduction. (Resolved) The standard is three months of rent exemption and a 30% rent reduction. (2) How should we proceed if the landlord has no sincerity in mediation? (Resolved) The association will immediately hire a legal advisor to handle the matter. (3) Petition the court for a considerable reduction to alleviate the people's difficulties. (Resolved) Permission is granted to petition the court immediately. (4) How should we express ourselves to all tenants? (Resolved) Permission is granted to distribute a declaration immediately to consolidate unity. (5) Nominate candidates for the executive committee. Chen Jiufeng, Chen Jiaofang, Zhuang Rongzhou, Zhang Liyang, He Baogen, Zhang Lishi, and Zhang Congxin were elected as members of the executive committee for this term.</p>

<p>Shao Yunpeng and Others Sue for Inheritance of Maternal Grandfather's Estate The judge earnestly persuaded both parties to reconcile After Sheng Zeheng, et al., analyzed the estate of their mother, Madam Zhuang, according to shares, Shao Yunpeng, et al., the nephews, filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Court, alleging that they had forged a will and swallowed up the share of Madam Zhuang's estate that their mother should have received, and hired a lawyer. Initially, Judge Wu heard the case. Later, the plaintiff applied for recusal. In the afternoon, Judge Shen came to the Third Court to continue the trial. Only Shao Yunpeng, Yunzhi, and Yunqi, three plaintiffs, were present. Shao Yunjun, Yunlin, and Yunxiang were not present. Among the defendants, Sheng Pan臣 was in Dalian, Sheng Guan因 went to Japan due to her husband's illness, and Sheng Fang抱 was ill and did not come. The remaining Sheng Zeheng, 蘋臣, Yu Chang, Yu You, Ai　, and Jing　were present. Shao Yueru claimed that she was from Yuyao, Zhejiang Province, and that the plaintiffs were her children. Although she knew about the case, she could not stop it. Judge Shen asked if 10,000 yuan had been sent after the Sheng family discovered the will. Shao replied that he did not know about this. Judge Shen then persuaded him, saying, "You and the Sheng family are relatives, and the plaintiffs are also your children. You might as well persuade them to avoid prolonged litigation." Shao Yueru replied that it was because he did not see the defendants, and then he earnestly persuaded both plaintiffs and defendants, saying that today both parties were not present and the defendants had filed a counterclaim, so both parties were in the same position and could not start the debate until everyone was present. However, several people were either studying abroad or doing business in Dalian and could not be present. Then this case would be delayed indefinitely and would never be concluded. Both parties are respectable merchants and relatives. It is better to find a way to mediate outside and make concessions to each other. Do not go to extremes to avoid endless litigation. Otherwise, at the next hearing, if any defendant is unable to be present, the trial proceedings will have to be suspended so that the debate can begin. The lawyers for both parties also expressed their agreement after hearing the judge's instructions. The witness Zhuang Fengying testified about the situation at the time when Madam Zhuang orally dictated the will and Shen Yiqing recorded and transcribed it. Judge Shen instructed that the case be adjourned for two weeks and ordered to try to reconcile outside.</p>
<p>Dance Hostess Dispute Qian Baoying Bullyies Others Wang Yingying is Brutally Beaten Qian Baoying, a dance hostess at the Jiuxing Dance Hall at 41 Edward Road, has been working there for more than a year. She has an affair with Bu Bao, the No. 2 waiter in the bar of the dance hall, nicknamed A'san. Therefore, Baoying is fearless and often bullies other dance hostesses, especially towards the one nicknamed "Little Guangdong," whom she dislikes. Three days ago, Wang Yingying, a girl from Zhujing, 17 years old, entered the dance hall as a dance hostess. Baoying saw that she was a newcomer and did not greet her. So, every night she made excuses to scold Yingying. One night before last, at around 11 p.m., Yingying, in order to win affection, got up and danced with Baoying. At the same time, Little Guangdong was also dancing with a guest. Inadvertently, Little Guangdong's heel touched Baoying's leather shoes. Baoying thought it was intentional, so after the music stopped, she questioned Little Guangdong aggressively. The two began to quarrel. At that time, Yingying was on the side and apologized and tried to mediate for Little Guangdong. Unexpectedly, Qian Baoying thought that Yingying was helping Little Guangdong, and turned around and cursed at Yingying. Therefore, Yingying also retorted. Baoying became angry out of embarrassment and grabbed Yingying to beat her. The two started to fight. At that time, the dance guests felt sorry for Yingying and asked the waiter A'san to temporarily take Baoying out. Unexpectedly, A'san locked both of them in a separate room and helped Baoying push Yingying to the ground. Baoying used her leather shoe heel to stomp hard on Yingying's chest. A'san also punched Yingying's waist fiercely. Therefore, Yingying fainted immediately. The dance hall owner, Andersan (transliteration), saw that he had caused trouble and quickly sent Wang Yingying to the Baolong Hospital on Baker Road for treatment. At the same time, Qian Baoying secretly ran away and asked for leave starting yesterday. Wang Yingying is still lying in bed No. 105 in Baolong Hospital, unable to speak. Her whole body is covered in bruises, and it is said that the injuries are not minor.</p>

<p>Concubine Fears Cohabiting with Legal Wife Commits Suicide by Poisoning Chen Yichang, also known as Ding, a Cantonese man, 31 years old this year, is married. He used to be the director of the Guangzhou Post Office and is now a clerk in the Second Section (Foreign Affairs Section) of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, living in the front building of No. 3, Fanshili, Haining Road. Chen met Wu Ailian (19 years old this year), a divorced young woman from the same hometown, last year and fell in love. They have been cohabiting until now, for almost a year. Recently, a month ago, he rented a pavilion room at No. 56, Hongyufang, Caishi Street, French Concession, and lived there separately. Recently, due to economic difficulties, he was unable to take care of the expenses of the two residences. He wanted Wu to move to Haining Road and cohabit with the legal wife. However, Chen's legal wife was暴戾in nature and had cursed at Wu several times, so Wu feared her like a tiger. She considered that once they cohabited, she would be abused, so she had a short view and directly absorbed electricity to commit suicide.

<p>Actively Assist the Northeast Volunteer Army</p>
<p>Two Thousand Yuan Remitted by the Bank of China</p>
<p>The colleagues of the Salt Affairs Auditing Office of the Ministry of Finance, with their patriotic enthusiasm, have always been second to none. Previously, during the 19th Route Army's anti-Japanese operations in Shanghai, the colleagues of the general and branch offices generously donated funds totaling more than two thousand yuan. Now, the colleagues of the general office, considering that the Northeast has been lost for a year, and our thirty million compatriots are being trampled upon by foreign invaders, living in dire straits and suffering the pain of national subjugation, are fortunate that the loyal and brave volunteer army of the three provinces is shedding blood on the battlefield, making continuous efforts to cause the brutal Japanese warlords to flee in panic and suffer heavy losses. The glorious battle achievements are frequently seen in the newspapers. It is said that the volunteer army is short of weapons, clothing, medical supplies, and other necessities, and is in a very difficult situation. Without assistance, how can they survive? Considering that every citizen is responsible for the rise and fall of the nation, and the anti-Japanese war in the Northeast cannot achieve success in a short period, the best way to donate funds is to make monthly subscriptions for long-term assistance. Currently, two thousand yuan has been raised and sent to the Bank of China for remittance. In the future, monthly payments of approximately the same amount will be made. Various auditing branch offices are also initiating similar efforts. Other organizations, groups, and merchants are said to be responding to the call with sympathy.</p>

<p>Tianci Towed into Wusong</p>
<p>Passengers and Cargo All Safe</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Chongming-Ningbo-Zhoushan ferry, the Yongzhou, departed from Nanmengang Port in Chongming at 7:00 yesterday morning. After passing Qixiao and other places in Zhen, it arrived at the Sanchashui sea area outside Wusongkou at around 11:00. Suddenly, in the engine room, a screw on the engine's starter was broken and fell off due to the force of the waves, causing the entire machine to malfunction and stop automatically. After the incident, the chief engineer immediately reported to the shipowner, who dropped anchor at the site. At that time, the Tianci, a ship on the same route from Shanghai to Chongming, was returning. The shipowner immediately pulled the whistle and waved the flag. After the Tianci saw this, it sailed closer to the Yongzhou. The Yongzhou shipowner explained the damaged machinery and asked the Tianci to tow it back to Shanghai. The Tianci shipowner agreed and immediately towed the Yongzhou with a cable. When towing into Wusongkou, the Jiuru tugboat, which was returning from towing oil tankers in Baozhen, saw the Yongzhou being towed by the Tianci and voluntarily offered to tow it to Shanghai. Therefore, the Yongzhou was towed into Wusongkou by the Jiuru tugboat, while the Tianci turned around and headed to Chongming. The Yongzhou arrived in Shanghai at around 3:00 and docked at Pier No. 9 in the South City. Passengers and cargo were all safe. It was originally scheduled to depart for Chongming today, but due to machinery repairs, one voyage has been temporarily suspended and is expected to resume as usual the day after tomorrow.</p>

<p>The Pu Zhao River in Western Shanghai has not been dredged for many years. The silt is shallow and dirty, affecting irrigation, transportation, and residents' drinking water. Ma Xiangbo and others jointly submitted a request to the municipal government to plan dredging. More than a month has passed, and no instructions have been received. The public is eagerly waiting, like clouds and rain.

<p>Groundbreaking Ceremony Held Yesterday</p>
<p>Wang Shouting Personally Nailed the First Rivet</p>
<p>The Navy Department's two newly built ships, Funing and Suining (formerly planned to be named Anning and Baoning), held a keel-laying ceremony at 9:00 AM yesterday. Navy Minister Chen Shaokuan, due to official duties in Beijing, specially telegraphed Torpedo Commander Wang Shouting to represent him in nailing the first rivet. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Attendees: In addition to Torpedo Guerrilla Commander Wang Shouting, those who attended yesterday included Deputy Minister of the Ministry, Chief Supervisor Li Shijia, Deputy Director of the Shipbuilding Plant Chen Zaofan, Guard Battalion Commander Ye Baoqi, Jiangzhen Captain Chen Shaoji, Accounting Section Chief Pan Yingzhou, Bookkeeping Section Chief Chen Zhushen, Machinery Department Chief Zeng Yijing, Supervisors Zeng Guosheng, Huang Yiyan, Shipbuilding Section Director Ye Zaifu, and more than 200 soldiers from the Navy Guard Battalion Jiangzhen Chu with the two ships.</p>
<p>Keel-Laying Situation: Minister Chen, due to official duties in Beijing, specially telegraphed Commander Wang Shouting to represent him in nailing the first rivet. At 9:20, Mr. Tu used force to nail the first rivet that had been burned onto the keel of the Funing ship. It took about five minutes to complete. Then he went to the keel of the Suining ship, where Mr. Wang nailed the first rivet in the same way. The ceremony was completed at 9:30, and Mr. Wang and others dispersed.</p>
<p>Telegram Report: After the keel-laying was completed, the Deputy Director of the Shipbuilding Plant, Chen Zaofan, telegraphed Minister Chen, stating, "To Minister Chen: The keels of the Funing and Suining were laid at 9:00 AM this month, and Commander Wang of the Torpedo Team nailed the first rivet.

<p>Mr. Zeng's Remarks: After the keel-laying, according to Supervisor Zeng Guosheng, who spoke to the Huadong News Agency reporter, the two ships are equivalent to the Jiangning and Haining ships and are specially used for attacking and suppressing river and sea bandits. They are 128 feet long, 20 feet wide, 7 feet draft, 10 nautical miles per hour, 180 tons displacement, and the cost, including armament, is about 250,000 yuan per ship. They are scheduled to be launched in February next year.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Wu Zhongxin Represents the Disaster Situation in Anhui <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>A Wasteland with Boundary Markers Removed, Difficult to Restore</p>
<p>Provincial Government's Financial Resources Exhausted, Unable to Share with Disaster Areas</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Ping, the representative sent by Anhui Provincial Government Chairman Wu Zhongxin to beg for disaster relief, told reporters yesterday that the counties of Liu'an, Yingshan, Tingqiu, and Huoshan in Anhui have fallen into the hands of the Red Bandits for quite some time. Many people have assimilated with the bandits. If relief is not sought urgently, it will be difficult to avoid the old and weak filling the ditches and the strong taking risks. The consequences are unimaginable. The four counties have now become a wasteland, barren and without a grain of harvest. The boundaries of the sea are indistinguishable, and the boundary markers have been removed, making it difficult to reorganize. Recovery is more difficult than last year's flood, and the severity is more than tenfold. Moreover, outside the four counties, in the areas affected by the bandits, there are also Tongcheng, Shucheng, Yingshang, Shou County, Hefei, Susong, Taihu, and Lujiang counties. Although not all of them have been disturbed, the disaster situation is quite serious. For example, the magistrate of Tongcheng County has been taken away by the bandits and is rumored to have been killed. As for the provincial government, its own administrative expenses are still difficult to maintain. Since the reorganization and establishment of the new provincial government five or six months ago, salaries have only been issued for one and a half months, so there is absolutely no surplus to share with the disaster areas. After the representatives came to Shanghai, they contacted various parties. The Anhui Fellow Villagers Association has promised to do its best to find a solution. The Shanghai Provisional Relief Association for Henan and Anhui Disaster Areas held a meeting once yesterday to discuss fundraising methods. The Engineering Department of the National Economic Commission, formerly the Chief Engineer Xi Mingjiu of the Engineering and Relief Department of the National Government's Disaster Relief Association, also promised to find ways to provide engineering relief in the disaster area. However, the survivors are exposed to the elements, with empty stomachs and shivering in the cold wind, and the number of starving people is increasing day by day. This situation is unbearable to describe. I hope that kind-hearted people from all walks of life will show compassion and save our helpless compatriots as soon as possible. On behalf of the provincial government and the disaster victims, I bow and report with sincerity.</p>
