<h3>航空與國防誠</h3>
<p>自新式利器坦克車發明潛水艇出世言國防者殆無不盛稱海陸軍之威力但自近三十年來飛機發明并應用於軍事上而後國防之重心乃不在陸地不在海上面在空中（無航空即無國防）在今日巳爲世界所公認美國空軍密吉爾將軍有言（空軍襲撃）國要害時陸軍之干涉與海軍之阻止皆非空軍所畏忌能與之周旋者亦惟空軍而巳）吾人細味密氏之言即可以覘知空軍關係國防之重大不僅此也空軍之威力尤足以變更戰略制敵機先迅速决定勝負之全局蓋在空氣之中旣不能掘戰壕而其他連網於輕氣球及設置高射砲種種之設備亦僅爲消極之防禦戰機一發擁有龐大之空軍力量者即可飛向敵人之要害一繋而决定勝負之機海軍與陸軍都不易爲力此則空軍充分發揮其威力之時也故曰（空軍襲撃一國要害時能與之周旋者亦惟空軍）故曰（無航空即無國防）</p>
<p>夫然故今日列强對於空軍之擴張與航空工業之發展無不竭盡其全力美英法意諸强之飛　邁進固無論矣即以日本而言其空軍實力雖量不如美質不如英但其於航空事業之推進則至爲努力舉國若狂尤其自九一八以後全國公私飛行機製造廠都晝夜開工製造國民對於航空事業之捐助極爲踴躍所謂自製（愛國機）與（報國機）之捐輸巳達數十架其他聽音機高射砲照空燈之捐助爲數尤多同時更大聲疾呼喚起被國人民建設空中防禦以保護其唯一工業中心之大坂其標語有曰（大坂如受敵機襲撃即爲日本之生死關頭）他如少年航空兵之嚴格訓練民間航空事業之提　倡無不竭盡其全力總之目前日本舉國上下對於空防之努力蓋巳達到白熱化之程度</p>
<p>世界各國之航空事業旣日益突躍猛進而對於空防尤集中全力不稍疎懈反觀我國則民間航空事業固不必言即所謂空軍亦尙處於萌芽時代散在若干省之少數航空機旣實力分散無統一之指揮而機之來源則更皆購自外國以言防空設備則不僅各省城市即首部重地及各要港堡壘亦毫無布置以言航空敎育亦僅有留學歸國之少數人材及初辦之一二學校以此與世界列强相較其程度殆不止於雲霄與泥壤吾人苟一默念（無航空即無國防）之言應立即爲之不寒而慄</p>
<p>在今年一二八滬戰中我軍隊與人民所遭受日本飛機之荼毒至爲顯而易見而目前東北各地之義勇軍於日本飛機之襲撃與轟炸亦至感應付之困難假使我國能有相當之空軍軍力則即不言進攻至少亦足以牽掣敵機而減少其爲害之能力就此又可證明密吉爾將軍（空軍襲撃一國要害時能與之周旋者亦惟空軍而巳）之言爲實確當</p>
<p>以故吾人認爲我國目前於空軍之擴張與航空工業之提倡實屬刻不容緩首應以舉國一致之努力注意於航空工業之發展籌集資本羅至外國專家設廠自製定擬計劃作有步驟之推進并加緊訓練航空之人材同時民間航空事業之組織亦應盡力提倡而全國空軍之指揮與民間航空事業之發展尤須絶對一致呼應蓋苟無統一之指揮與組織即令一縣有一飛機其效力亦實等於無竭盡舉國之全力望世界列强之後塵而急起直追目前巳爲最緊要之時機必如是而後我國土可不致有敵機炸爲焦土之虞而後我民族之生存可以維持於永久</p>

<p>敬氏、天行會推荐頭山滿爲會長、由秀三担任實務、以國士館長柴田篤次郎爲扶助員、係擁有明大·拓大·國士館等各大學學生之國家主義之右翼團體、且得玄洋社之扶助、而與小櫻會相提携、頭山秀三係受父滿之薰陶、爲有膽力有作爲之靑年、而非爲脅嚇等事之人物、秀三之關係似專在思想方面、又搜查昭和房屋三樓天行會本部及八幡俱樂部住宅之警官與檢事一行、曾搜獲三支手槍與多數重要書類、</p>

<h3>松岡訪俄要人負有兩重任務</h3>
<p>一方勸誘承認僞組織</p>
<p>一方探詢對國聯態度</p>
<p>蘇聯提訂約條件</p>
<p>非日本所能接受</p>
<p>國民社四日東京電松岡洋右在莫斯科遍訪俄要人、雖自稱僅係友誼與非正式之談話、而日本各大報連接近政府各報在内、莫不期望此舉能獲鉅大結果、據報紙紀載其訪問俄要人之主要目的、除接洽不侵犯條約外、大致尙有兩種、一爲向蘇俄解釋日本與（滿洲國之關係、消除俄人之疑忌、二爲探測俄政府被邀參加國聯行政院會議討論李頓報告時之態度、先加以疏通、此外再於消釋俄人疑忌之後、乘間以合作開發滿洲爲餌、勸蘇俄承認僞組織、按加拉罕前在駐華大使任内駐節北平時、即與松岡洋右相識、兩人旣有舊誼、此次不難暢所欲言、故日人對於松岡在俄談話期望頗奢云、</p>
<p>國民社四日莫斯科電據可靠方面傳出、蘇俄外副委員加拉罕曾向日本出席國聯低表松岡洋右表示、願見日俄不侵犯條約早日簽訂、並聞加拉罕對於此約雖表示同情態度、但提出若干提議、有非松岡所能完全接受者、當初兩人預期談話三十分鐘、嗣乃延長至兩小時而别、並訂明日繼續晤商、松岡與加拉罕晤談後、復訪外交委員李維諾夫、談話内容未悉、但亦近一小時方别、料所商主要問題、當在不侵犯條約、</p>

<h3>法軍縮新計劃</h3>
<p>統一國際徵兵制度</p>
<p>軍備平等樹立基礎</p>

<p>哈瓦斯四日日内瓦電軍縮會議休息室中、一般議論均以彭古陳述法國計畫、純就技術上立言、而避去一切政治上及感情上之見地、故甚表贊同、彭古之説明注重法國計畫精神上之綱要、并謂法國政府於草擬此項計畫時、曾有外國人員襄助、此層更使人發生極好印象、英美兩國代表團、由今日起、對法國代表之態度表示贊同、其故以彭古一再聲明法國計畫、大抵爲歐洲大陸各國而設、其他各國加入與否、可聽其便、至少在互相援助及劃一軍制兩節、當作如是看法、歐洲各國代表團大半暫取緘默態度、意大利代表不願發表意見、德國代表不報未能出席惟休息室中仍有德國人士、對於彭古之陳述並無不利之意見、法國計畫之勇邁性質、頗爲德國人士所驚異、吾人由此可抱絶大希望、一俟法國計畫用書面提出之後、則軍縮會議目下之僵局、即可打破、軍縮會議主席團本日下午計論比國代表布爾幹之報告時、亦發生一重大事件頗値吾人之注意、即關於國際監察軍備委員會就地搜查一層、不惟法國波蘭及荷蘭予以贊助、即英國亦表同情、惟英國提出一種保留、即此項搜查辦法、當任其成爲常設性也、可見以後如有某一國家控告、或經軍縮常任委員會之决定、即可舉行搜查一層、英國業已承認、此種讓步、於軍縮前途關係極大、固不待贅言也、</p>
<h3>巴本播音演説無意放棄政權</h3>

<h3>國聯特會與日美戰爭（續）</h3>
<p>（日本海軍少佐石丸藤太著·本報譯）</p>
<p>委任統治領土問題日本若退出國聯、則南洋羣島之委任統治領土將如何、（？）是否可以之爲原因、引起戰爭、（？）此中詳情、當俟别篇、茲但一述余之結論、蓋就法理上言、此種委任統治地域、當解爲不屬國聯而屬於日英美法意五大國、然在國際政治、常以政治上考慮爲必要、法律上之考慮、反覺無甚力量、故日本雖倚賴法理論爲後盾、反對收回該地域、但一經外國反對、尤其是美國出而反對、結局即成爲實力問題、對此問題、纒繞不休、即有引起戰爭之可能性、</p>
<p>然非謂日本退出國聯後、即因此一問題而引起戰爭也、此一問題、不過於國聯、美國對日本之險惡空氣、更作火上添油之勢、蓋必與後文所述第二段第三段之對日壓迫策、互相凑合、然後成爲促進戰爭之補助機關也、</p>
<p>中國之對日報復據上所述、此次國聯特會之直接結果、似無引起戰爭之虞、唯吾人所當戒心者、轉在國聯特會開會後、國聯形勢之變化、假使中國方面、允許日本直接交涉、且於直接交涉之際、表示大讓步之態度、又使美國一變其從來之反日東洋政策而爲親日政策、則戰爭可以不起、何幸如之、若其不然、而中國斷行對日報復、美國亦依然繼續今日之態度、則以其他大事件不突發爲限、一九三五年前後、戰爭必將乘時而起、</p>
<p>此次國聯特會之結果、所謂對日本情形最惡之時、即中國拒絶直接交涉、或雖允許交涉、絲毫不肯讓步時也、當此之際、直接交涉、旣經終於破裂、於是中國對於日本、遂决定出於報復手段、</p>
<p>例如用大規模之攪亂滿洲政策、及大排塲之對日經濟絶交、此皆報復手段之甚酷烈者、前者使日本别無他法、祗有出中國、占領其北平天津等要地、且繼續占領之、令中國不敢再萌攪亂滿洲之意思、於是問題一變而更加重大、將蹈上海事件覆轍、致來列國之干涉、夫當上海事件爭執最劇烈時、列國神經尖鋭化至何等程度、我日本人當猶記億不忘、若復第二第三之上海事件接踵而起、與第一之平津占領、前後相映、是日本軍在中國本部遂占領許多重要地點矣、列國豈能坐視不理、於是世界大戰爭序幕、大有即日揭開之勢、</p>
<p>我國一部分論者、嘗謂中國懲於上海事件、不敢再行造成第二上海事件、自貽伊戚、雖然、自中國方面言之、若能使列國捲入中日戰爭中、中國即可假手外人、撃退日本、故一部分人之樂觀論、至此巳價値全失不足取也、</p>
<p>九國條約國會議及四國條約國會議此次國聯特會、對於日本、或竟不用何等制裁手段、或雖用國聯規約上之制裁、及胡佛式制裁、而不見功效、則美國當繼續其今日之對日政策、講求第二段之日本壓迫策、尤其在中國取報復手段極東形勢益趨惡化之附、冷靜之美國輿論、亦將變爲熱烈、勢必援助其政府之第二段對日壓追策、此時美國政府方始得有出於積極態度之機會、</p>
<p>所謂第二段壓迫日本政策、當不出下列二種、㈠召集關於中國之九國條約會議、㈡召集關於太平洋之四國條約會議是也、原美國召集之本旨、在於藉此會議、固結英美法之結束、合力以抑制日本、然遇有召集此種會議之提案、日本儘可毅然拒絶參加、不待言也、蓋由法理上解釋之、據九國條約第七條及四國條約第二條、締約國所得爲者、祇有通知、交涉、收到美國通知之國、初不負有同意美國措置之義務、以此之故、我國雖將所收通知束之高閣、亦絶無遠反條約之嫌也、</p>
<p>日本拒絶參加、會議之召集、勢將終於不成立、其結果徒使美日關係益趨惡化、而引起戰爭之危險、即潜伏其中矣、</p>
<p>一九三五年之軍縮會議四國條約九國條約之締約國會議、召集通知、旣遭拒絶、美國之唯一救濟方法、止有坐待一九三五年之軍縮會議而巳、</p>
<p>依華盛頓及倫敦海軍條約所規定之海軍限制及太平洋防備限制、至一九三六年年末而失效、其作成新軍縮條約以代此等條約之會議、應於一九三五年内召集、吾想美國必將利用此項會議、對於日本、試行最後壓迫、海軍軍備縮减、固在提議之列、即滿洲問題、亦必特别提出、請求淸算、届時美國將提出何等軍縮案、觀近日提出國聯之胡佛軍縮案、已可得其大槪、此軍縮案、因爲重在反對英日兩國、是以在國聯中、未能成立、但現在英國已經表示妥協態度、一九三五年之軍縮會議、此胡佛軍縮案即當爲會議中第一重要議題、而此軍縮案之主眼、在於將日本之河軍力完全加以封鎖、</p>
<p>關於滿洲問題、美國當援日本在山東及西伯利亞先例以前述胡佛式制裁法爲護符、要求日本交還滿洲於中國、或將日本在滿洲之權益、與以最少限度之限制、</p>

<p>接特載</p>
<p>日本旣明知美國含有此種魂膽、或將一九三五年之軍縮會議一併拒絶參加、亦未可定、若果如此則美國一面揚言日本拒絶參加和平會議、一面因華盛頓及倫敦條約至一九三六年年末而廢異、｜依條約規定、在二年前之一九三四年即應通告廢棄、｜遂直向大規模擴張海軍、並盡力完成菲律濱關島諸防備方面、猛進突飛、於是日美之關係、忽倒轉至華盛頓會議以前形勢、而戰爭之開幕、乃一刻迫近一刻矣、届時英國亦迫得無法、止好追隨美國、捲入日美戰爭漩渦中、其結果或將惹起第二次世界大戰、是此次全武行大打出手、實以滿洲事變開塲、中間搬演日英美太平洋戰爭、而以第二次世界大戰收塲、誠一齣戰爭連銷劇、其光景之悲壯慘烈、將有千百倍於滿洲上海者、又豈始禍人夢想所及哉、</p>
<p>夫形勢之日趨惡化、我旣洞燭於幾先而無論如何設法、除退還滿洲外、終不能避免戰禍、則時日之遲延、於日本徒增不利、不待言也、且就海軍力之比率上言、就經濟之狀態上言、日本皆以速戰爲有利、則與其遲至一九三六年以後、坐待人來攻我、何如即於一九三六年以前、先發制人之爲愈乎、此吾所以有欲事戰爭愈早愈妙之放論也、</p>
<p>日本應取之塗徑此次國聯特會、對付日本、若取最險惡之塗徑、則日本當以不辭一戰之决心、勇往直前、貫澈我最初目的、</p>
<p>反之、現勢若能於我比較有利、則日本亦須大改換其政策、示全世界以和平愛好之至誠、方不失爲賢明之謀國舉動、他如主張軍國主義、一任軍人不安本分、妄欲左右國家政策、則無論情事如何、國家終必受其災禍、難保不演出德意志第二之慘劇、不可不再三自省也、</p>
<p>日本今正立於關係重大之和戰歧路、斷不可拘泥於區區局部之見、與夫傳統之攘夷思想、而當着眼於世界大勢、以料理國政、庶幾博得最後勝利、是又吾所切望於我政府與我國民者也、</p>
<p>要聞</p>
<h3>日本對北滿深感棘手</h3>
<p>無法應付蘇炳文軍</p>
<p>北平特訊、昨接哈爾濱友人所發二十八日函云、日本之於東北三省、滿以爲水到渠成、只要日本軍隊一到、又有幾個漢奸作内應、那是不成問題的、要圓就圓、要扁就扁、任隨　如何佈置就得了、何况牠自以爲對南滿巳經有二十多年的經營、不光是有軍事勢力足以控制一切、即經濟的力量、也都掌握在日本人手裏、并且多半是在日本政府及軍部指導之下、其兼併東北三省、當然有莫大的便利、殊不知九一八之後、　的兼併政策、到現今實騐了一年、玩過多少把戲、從治安維持會到傀儡政府、經過了幾多的御用工具、現在甚至一般日本浪人、親自出馬到傀儡國做官、可是一般的情形、依然不曾變好、而且没有變好的希望、連最低限度的治安、也不能維持、南滿路從前算最安全而管理最良好的一條鐵路、現在幾乎没有人敢坐、即使有不得巳事故、而乘車的人、也必十　戒備、因爲沿路一帶、每天甚至於每點鐘、保不定有一個地方會出亂子、｜刦車開仗、從前日本報紙和當地官廳、對這種事情、非常注意、每月都有統計、鐵路不通或誤點、都是緊急事件、現在差不多見慣不驚了、日本官廳、也爲了顔面關係、禁止各報登載關於交通隔斷的消息、不過一般人還是非常注意這件事、對日本人的惡感、也一天比一天加深、從前本有許多人不滿於張氏政權、確有親日色彩的、現在都覺着從前的錯誤、民族感情的火燄、重復燃燒起來、所以許多在傀儡國裏的軍隊、都各懷異志、日本軍隊仍舊把他們放在前線、用機關槍在後面督隊、可是反正的依然是天天有、東北廣漠的原野、何處不是馳騙的塲所、</p>
<p>在南滿方面交通比較便利、日本人運輸方便、援兵的調集很容易、所以大股的義勇軍、很不容易站得住、可是在北部就不同了、特别是這一次蘇炳文和張殿九兩軍的反正、最爲有趣、到現在一個多月了、日本軍隊在哈爾濱以至齊齊哈爾一帶的有姬路第十師團全部約二萬人、還有其他各特種部隊、日軍人數在長春以北的有三萬以上、但不敢去攻撃蘇氏所部的（救國義勇軍、）</p>
<p>牠不敢去攻撃的原因、據日本人自己説、是因爲海拉爾滿洲里一帶、有兩百多日本軍被囚、有三百餘日本婦孺在那邊被拘、如果日軍一旦進攻、則這幾百人將生命不保、所以牠們要先救出被拘囚的人纔用兵、其實不用兵的原故、第一是日本軍隊本身、對於這種爲軍閥圖功的戰爭、巳經厭倦了、第二東北地方實在太廣大、少數的兵力、很難於防守、如果徵調多數的軍隊、花消莫大的軍費、所得還是無幾、第三中東路有蘇聯的關係、如果沿中東路用兵、在日本此時正對蘇聯聯歡的時候、惹起意外的糾紛、很不値得、何况蘇聯的遠東　司令官是主戰的、日本豈能無所顧忌、所以日本對於中東路西段的義軍、只好天天講和平、并且還邀請蘇聯領事帮忙救濟被拘日人、日軍最前線在甘南、到現在并不見有向西推進的模樣、牠對於蘇氏的要求是、</p>
<p>㈠即時中止反滿抗日的態度、</p>
<p>㈡撤退沿鐵路部隊、即行退歸原防、不妨碍通車、</p>
<p>㈢任蘇炳文爲呼倫貝爾警備司令、</p>
<p>㈣補給蘇軍軍費二十萬元、</p>
<p>㈤立即無條件釋放被拘禁之日本人、</p>
<p>不料蘇氏絶不爲動、仍然積極整備、由張殿九副司令任前鋒、并在海拉爾組織政府、其軍隊最前綫朱家坎碾子山一帶、築壕備戰、且扣留日軍偵察飛機兩架及駕駛機師渡邊少佐等五名、日本在龍江及哈爾濱的軍政當局十分着急、曾派過兩架爆炸機一架戰鬥機去實行威嚇、但都没有歸隊、據説是都被撃落了、十月二十七日夜間、曾有義軍五百夜襲龍江、戰至天曉、因衆寡不敵退去、義軍非常神秘、所以日方對我們在哈的中國人、特别是關内的人戒備得厲害、怕我們響應義軍、</p>

<h3>硬地網球賽形勢漸趨緊張</h3>
<p>林寳華江道章鄭兆佳昨均勝</p>
<p>今日余田光梁德光單打複賽</p>
<p>法商總會之硬地網球賽、華人參列其問者、如林寳華與梅德摩之男女混合、江道章鄭兆佳之男子雙打、及余田光孫麟方梁德光之男子單打（江氏原亦參加之一、後即放棄）昨日林江鄭三氏均有比賽、結果咸告勝利、今日下午二時半余田光對梁德光之男子單打複賽、大可一觀、茲將各方形勢錄後、</p>
<h3>男子雙打賽</h3>
<p>是項賽中、計有八組昨日江道章鄭兆佳各以絶妙技藝、大敗敵方哥爾梅專特、結果六比二六比一、不日即與史密斯史魁亞决賽、昨日同時卡那凡洛塔佛斯初以兩個六比二勝胡氏昆仲、繼以七比九·六比三·三比六比數、被巴倫芝梅咸斯撃敗、各方實力比較之下江鄭可穏得錦標、</p>
<h3>男子單打賽</h3>
<p>參加者十二人、江道章其一、嗣爲鼓勵新手計、開塲棄權於孫麟方手中、孫氏蓋亦有希望之一人也、其餘若余田光·梁德光等、均裝備前進、今日下午二時半、二氏舉行複賽、另一方面、孫麟方與巴倫芝對峙於複賽綫上他日孫氏苟勝、將成爲我華人爭奪首席之局面矣、</p>
<h3>男女混合賽</h3>
<p>是項參加者六對、昨日方始開賽、林寳華與梅德摩即以六比零·六比二勝羅夫人與冷士林傑、今日卡那凡洛、與考拉沙小姐出塲、將來决賽、恐係上述二隊、而後者希望較大、其餘四對、實力稍遜、中途必遭失敗、</p>
<h3>海軍實力忽强東華若戰得勝</h3>
<p>結果三與零之比</p>
<p>上半時各無建樹</p>
<p>西聯足球會中之英海軍實力、强强弱弱、不可意料、昨日平庸無能者、今日或一變而爲强有力之球隊矣、蓋軍隊不時調防、而球隊之實力、亦時有變更、證之往年、彰彰明矣、卽如今年之海軍、亦一無能之輩、曾以零比十一敗於曁南、但昨日與東華戰於棒球場之海軍、赫然一强有力之隊伍矣、乃由新近來滬之康脱與凱脱兩隊合併出場者、康脱艦隊、曩以二比一撃敗全盛時代之樂華、今雖實力稍减、仍屬勁旅、故昨戰中上半時竟各無所得、下半時中、東華費盡九牛二虎之力、始連中三元、而得最後勝利、一般球迷、咸以爲昨戰必無新彩、到場者僅寥寥三千餘人、目覩塵戰情形、却又無不驚歎、茲錄其激戰經過情形如下、</p>
<p>陳洪光三度失機</p>
<p>銀备一鳴、三軍</p>
<p>列陣、東華位南、乘風姨助威、向北大舉撻伐、李義臣闖入重圍、陳萬兩騎、左右輔弼、亨許攔擋不得、乞援於土佛兒、球始出險、馮運佑忠勇過人、輸送得當、萬象華傳中一脚、陳洪光迎用頭攻、可惜越横柱而成野球、龍雷開球不遠、吳幼良中途截得、傳與虞添、亨包兩敵將衝出開球線、内部空虚、義臣小萬銜枚急走、至射球區域、抛送與洪光、再度頭攻、後成野球、未二分、陳洪光單槍匹馬、衝人敵人腹地、馮運佑獲球、遙對適門射掃、洪光趕上加油、球如水時之大　、竟三過其門而不入、</p>
<p>李義巨首下敵城</p>
<p>英軍在驚濤駭浪　中討生活、至十餘分鐘、幸未陷陣、乃大舉反攻、數度撲我陣地、李寗勞苦功隊、關洵安當仁不讓、致敵無法入我腹地、休息之後、英軍以風勢轉順、進攻巳見勇鋭、時時登堂入室、借前鋒無矯健脚頭、致屢成功虧一簣、激戰至十五分後、屠開元呐喊興兵、馮運佑接濟于後、陳家球帶球盤過亨許、遠交小萬、土佛兒遞來一步、球巳傳中、李義臣在龍雷類上、頂球入　、紀錄始開、</p>
<p>萬象華又奏奇功</p>
<p>敵雖失去一城、</p>
<p>氣熖愈見囂張、屈魯與葛利英尤稱猛勇、環鐵門而攻者、五六次、皆未能得手、未幾、李寗在内衛綫踢出一球、屠開元趕卽傳與洪光、三傳兩遞、球爲萬象華所得、勢如奔馬、台佛抵死糾纒不得、三開亦陸續失守、小萬旣入無人之境、乃急舉足叩門、龍雷拘救無方、球又由左上角進門、淸晰鋭急、殊爲美妙、</p>
<p>佛蘭母誤會失機</p>
<p>東華兩球旣得、　光芒萬丈、得心庶手、所向無前、亨許雖勇、究有人老力衰之感、上半時應付尙無差誤、下半時乃見時露窘態加以兩城失去、士無鬭志、内衛綫尤見混亂、無何、陳虞添孤軍深入、至相當地點、短交家球、佛蘭母不知何故、呆若木鷄、見球不救、遂爲李義臣又建一功、是球彈佛蘭母之之背部入門、守門曾仆地拘救而未及、戰未已時、戰雲慘淡胡笳聲起、東華又奏凱歌、</p>
<p>東華隊</p>
<p>屠開元　萬象華</p>
<p>李寗　　　　陳决光</p>
<p>周賢言　　　　馮運佑　李義臣</p>
<p>關洵安　　　　陳家球</p>

<p>字林報云、往日舊税則所定尋常商品之税率甚輕、故尋常商品私運者爲數有限自新税則實施後、於是不納税之商品、可獲厚利而組織完備之私運機關、遂紛紛成立、私運貨物不復限於玉石鴉片嗎啡軍械及貴重奢侈品卽普通日用品亦可藉私運而獲利甚巨矣至私運機關皆按貨價收費人多樂就之、故所入亦殊豐厚、近兩年來若輩極爲活動其私運之普通商品、爲數絶巨、惟目下尙不能估計其確數、邇來上海海關搜查之商店、多半爲首飾店與鐘錶店、此項物品易於藏匿多置於旅客之行李中或由旅客藏諸身上亦有暗藏笨重之貨物中者、設計絶巧、不易偵破、而郵件包裏亦便私運小件物品、香港大連今均爲自由口岸、且逼近中國各口岸、故私運者遂利用其地而設總部於該二處、今日中國之私運機關、泰半爲華人經營、然外人亦有營此業者據字林報香港訪員傳來消息、廣州與香港間邇來私運極盛、且有藉政界中人爲護符者、南華沿海其他各口岸、亦與香港聯絡私運爲數甚巨、海關對付此種私運、現巳加緊防杜、雖比諸歐美防範制席尙未可謂完備然已獲得奇異結果海關曾爲此特造巡輪多艘有已落成調用者、有尙在製造中者、本年六月八日曾由梅樂和夫人舉行一新巡輪下水禮、現其内部早已裝置完竣、上月初曾在吳淞口外試駛、速度頗快、尙有一同型之姊妺船、刻在江南造船所建造將竣預料本月内亦可試車接收至新巡輪中關員對於使用槍械等、均受嚴格訓練、以增效能最近據巡查北洋之某新巡輪報告、天津烟台等埠、糖之私運以查緝嚴密業已歛跡市上所售糖價已照平常價格不復如數月前之反低於批價矣、海關當道旣已添造巡船加緊防範逆料私運之風當可漸戢税收亦可增旺、查目下歐洲國家其税務經費往往因緝私而激增例如德國竟將總税收百分之三十、用於緝私經費、中國海關緝私經費之百分率現尙無法算定、但比諸德國恐尙不及其十分之一耳</p>

<p>國聞社云、我國絲綢、年來受各國關税加重及日絲綢競銷影響、幾至一蹶不振、國外貿易、全告呆滯、記者昨晤最近返國之越南僑胞某某兩君、探得華絲綢在越受創情形、誌之如下、</p>
<h3>關税增加驚人</h3>
<p>代表云、在民國　　十九年、中法未訂新約之前、我國運往之絲綢茶磁器等、因與法貨尙無鉅大抵觸、尙能享受一種特别税、其時越南華貨、尙可暢銷、迨新約初訂、華僑深覺此後華貨運越、或受相當打撃、雖曾數次電呈我外部注意新約内容、未幾我政府實行公布、而法方則並無公布、竟至尙未批准、遷延至今、已兩年有五月、查該項新約、批明五年爲期期滿或須重行修改、而此兩年五月期中、旅越僑胞如於無約國民然、華貨入越、亦遭無約國之徵收、由特别税（即最低税）而降至平等税、再加照原税二三倍至八九倍以至十數倍、此項關税之增加、實足驚人、</p>
<h3>日絲綢受惠税</h3>
<p>華貨至此、以運　　貨浩大、關税苛徵、不得不絶跡於越南、同時替代華貨、則日貨、是按日法於本年五月間、成立一種新約、曩時華貨在越享受最惠税之各貨、日本則隨而受之、於是市上日貨、觸目皆是、僑胞目撃心傷、然以身處異域、無能爲也、</p>
<h3>亟謀補救辦法</h3>
<p>祖國年來、内遭　　内戰及共匪之蹂躪、外受各帝國主義及强鄰壓迫與凌虐、全國經濟、已處破産地位、商業停頓、社會不寗、欲謀補救、在朝中央要人、須彌除私見、團結對外、除謀國内同胞安居樂業外、旅外之僑胞、亦應顧及、實業界之出品、須精益求精、對外貿易、更須注意國際商業信義萬不可將就從事、以劣貨運往國外、以失信用於外、要知旅外僑胞、亟歡迎國貨暢銷異域也云云、</p>
<h3>絲織業將集議</h3>
<p>本埠絲織業各　　領袖、因鑒於絲織物在外銷路、遭各國關税苛徵、遂致一落千丈、國計民生、深爲堪虞、兼以越南南圻中華商會代表返國請願、尤覺事之迫急聞日内卽將集議討論辦法、以資救濟、</p>

<p>九三老人馬相伯語錄</p>
<h3>商店和私塾家庭和工藝</h3>
<p>— 景記</p>
<p>相老人談··從前的商店是私塾·家庭婦女習工藝的　　幾時太陽落山了·路上少行人·門上少主顧·便關店門··有一問商店便有一補習私塾。管賬先生是老師··小徒弟都是學生··敎課是學珠算習書法。差不多·一般情形都是如此！管賬先生因爲是小徒弟們的義務老師··因此小徒弟們升做店員時，他的位置愈顯得崇高了！好的店員·知恩報本·當然不會忘記·他所受的商業上必需知識·旣是管賬先生授的·所以對於老師也就常保持相當的敬意。這麽一來，一間商店，都很融治·不更易經營和發展嗎？｜不知道·現在世風又變成怎樣了？</p>
<p>記得光緒三十年·我到日本，看見他們補習學問的風氣。在普通學校講格物幾何課時·有了不少歲數很大的·或許是學生的父兄輩，站在敎室外的兩廊·對那口講指畫的敎師們·側耳點頭·諦聽出神··這種好學的情形、參觀的我至今還有印象的！</p>
<p>談到家庭·以前婦女都學手工。有人告訴我，一件女袍現在要好幾塊錢手工錢，拿給縫衣舖去做！我聽到、覺得該如此！爲什麽伊們自己不會做呢？活該伊們呌太貴了！從前家庭老輩，有老太太活到七八十歲，還督促家中婦女做女紅··雖然家用很彀，還製些綿衣送給窮苦人穿着呢！現什世風又不同了！</p>
<p>自然，提到這此事，相老人是很有感慨的！</p>
<h3>老與新</h3>
<p>— 碧</p>
<p>｜老牌子新出品｜</p>
<p>在這年頭兒，甚麽事都要　個新。例如穿衣服，長袍短褂，不時行了，新派朋以，須得穿上一身西裝。兩裝已足表示新派了，可是説起西裝的樣子，又必做一九三三年式的，以表示新派到未來。以一例百，舉一反三，不買東西則巳，要買，非揀最新式的，就算落伍，不能算是時代的人。</p>
<p>但是車情足往往矛盾得厲害。越是要買世上最近製造的新式東西，却偏要跑進老店去買比方一式兩家商舖，一家是始創於同治元年的，一家是民國二十一年開的，發售的東，一樣的來路，同治元年的，一定比了民國二十一年的來得生意好。説來説去，總不外同治元年的，沾了一塊牌子的光。</p>
<p>姑蘇老陸稿薦，飯店弄老正興館，這是何等響亮的老牌子。七世八世祖傳儒醫老甚麽家，始創於同治年間的老醫院，往往是應診不暇。不論是吃的用的，倘使店裏的招待員説，（這是最老的老牌，）那必定能受人歡迎。但是假使在（最老的老牌之下，再加上一個最新的出品·）那必定益發的受人歡迎。因爲在這年　兒，就祇有一塊牌子是老的好，説到貨品，那就愈新愈妙。</p>
<p>本報在報界中，可算是第一塊老牌子。内地人不拘看甚麽報，一槪呌做申報，從這上面，　就可以表示本報資格之老。但是老就値錢在牌子上，内容賣一個（新）。本報雖是老牌子老到了頂，内容却新到了頭。就是本談，雖也是一塊老牌子，内容却日新月異。</p>
<h3>資本戰的一幕</h3>
<p>— 天方</p>
<p>就紅的包，綠的包，高高地疊着。大的，小的，糖妙栗子的　子滿街陳列着。留聲機，鑼鼓，木炭的氣味，振耳的呌賣，當你走過每條　路時，你可以看到還有時間性的商業的資本戰的一幕。不錯，在這大變動的時代，一切的一切，都失去了故常。你盾大减價的廣告，貼得像夏天的臭蟲一樣多，多得使人討厭。滿街的西藥聲，吹打得像發了狂，人的臉是沉默着，錢與血一樣的凝滯，社會是像病牛，朝着没落的途中走。一切的人們，只期待着，期待着新生從崩濃中誕生。</p>
<h3>畸形愛的成功</h3>
<p>— 柯定倉</p>
<p>並不是一椿奇聞｜</p>
<p>我早已聽見表弟李樹成説過，他們｜杭州｜ＸＸ校裏有一位同學·在他的言動方面，十分顯露了女性的表示，可是伊自己，却始終不肯承認是女性。</p>
<p>杭州呌姑娘們，是代以（大靑娘）三個字的，於是ＸＸ校的同學們，都爲伊取了這個（大靑娘）的雅號。伊每聽到這樣稱呼的時候，常常扭着頸兒，撅着小嘴，表示着模棱兩可的情態。這樣，不是證即不同學們的描擬是對的嗎？</p>
<p>樹成還説，和伊同房間住的，有四個年總彷佛的同學。和伊碰頭的，却巧是伊的同鄉｜紹興人。所以他們兩個人比較地來得親熱，在晚上其他二人都睡熟了··他們倆却還興趣委濃的談着笑着。有一次其他二人中的一個，鑒於他們倆每晚這樣，他裝作假睡，暗地裏偵察他們，事情太巧了正在這晚，破露丁他們倆的秘密，而且還明白地知道伊是一位生理畸形者。第二天由那人的傳佈，全校風雨滿城了··雖然不在他們倆面前説穿。</p>
<p>後來，就放了年假，今年春季開學的時候，他們倆都没有來。</p>
<p>ＸＸ　　ＸＸ　　ＸＸ</p>
<p>最近，樹成給我一封信是這樣説，·····以前和你説的畸形者和對方，居然在今年初夏結婚了。校裏有些同學在月前接到他們倆和結晶品的合影伊越覺得媚了··結晶品是男性，面貎和伊差不多。這樣看來，生理畸形者，也有結婚的可能。</p>
<h3>邱大哥的新騙術</h3>
<p>— 碧君</p>
<p>｜上海黑幕之一｜</p>
<p>綺麗的上海，五花八門，無奇不有就是騙術，也鈎心鬥角，日異月新··且有以此爲職業攫取金錢，匿居旅邸，宿柳眠花，肆情揮霍的鬼蜮人們。</p>
<p>最近有邱某其人者，年約二十三四，面孔黝黑，身材瘦小，口嵌金齒，戴着南洋華僑亞洲步行團團長的頭銜，穿着童子軍裝，或獵裝，持捐簿遍向各公司，商店，洋行，機關，募欵··托辭新由雲南回來，有該地人士題名錄爲證，打算再到西藏，靑海，印度去，并印有電影隊信箋，以便探險尋幽，到處攝影云云，聽者每以靑年壯志，冒險步行，深爲嘉許；故慷慨解囊的，大有其人；此項騙子，類能操簡單英語，是以歐美人士，間亦墜其殼中。認捐以後，每倩人題簽簿中，以資憑證，如遇國貨廠家，實業商店，預備到南洋地主，傾銷出品，而若無門徑的人們，伊則鼓其如簧之舌；輒云可代介紹，先取貨樣，作爲推廣等語、如無敵牌化裝品，一心牌牙刷，陳嘉庚，施德之等品，皆纍纍捆載而去··到手以後，隨即出賣，換取金錢，徜徉於各大旅館，尋芳買笑，度其荒唐生活。</p>
<p>在下已碰過數次騙人的技倆，依樣葫蘆，戚友談起，亦復雷同。有一天晚上，偶爾驅車過神州旅舍，忽聽黄包車夫，呌苦爭鈔，乘客舉手批頰的聲浪··其勢汹汹，定睛一看，乘客非别，乃是步行的邱大哥｜從車夫口中知道，他是從小花園拖來的，唉！如此距離，怕勞玉趾，未知他萬水千山，怎麽步行呢？據説伊閒嘗趁坐汽車，或御汽車艇，挾妓蕩漾黄浦江中；整日優遊，從未越出洋場一步，所謂雲南各地，人士題名錄者，細察其字跡，多出一手，鬭書木戳，亦多贋品。</p>
<p>現在東北難民，呼籲無門，義軍抗日，拼命血戰，金錢接濟，急如星火；何能容此　賊招搖撞騙？深盼社會人士，加以防範，勿爲無謂之犧牲。</p>

<h3>死之岔道（六）</h3>
<p>— 范烟橋</p>
<p>不久，愛姑受了四因的同化作用，和韓大少奶的指導，一樣一的轉變了：第一，把又笨又大又粗陋的髮髮，改成又小又玲瓏又光亮的一個：第二，把上衣的長度，減短三分之二，身裁減小了五分之一，質科也從靑布改爲白竹布：連襪，鞋，都換了以前的模樣，因此便像一塊璞玉，經過玉工的琢磨，頓然神光煥發，證明（人靠衣裝）的老話，是有意味的。</p>
<p>韓大少奶向大少爺説：（慕良，你瞧我的本領如何？愛姑到這裏不到一個月己脫胎换。）骨了。）</p>
<p>慕良狠興奮地説：（愛姑生成是可造之才，要是别的毛了丫頭，儘管裝扮，也没有用的。）　　韓大少奶從鏡台抽屉裏，拿出一瓶雪花粉來説：（倘然再把這東西給伊常常的塗，包管更要討人歡喜些。）</p>
<p>慕良笑説；（討誰的歡喜？）</p>
<p>·韓大少奶把食指向慕良的額上一點説：（討你的歡喜啊。）</p>
<p>幕良乾笑了幾聲。韓大奶隨手在懸空的電鈴上捺了一下，不多時，愛姑進來了，慕良從頭至脚再仔細的看了幾遍，尤其注目到伊圓圓的臉兒上，和飽滿而妙有含蓄，耐人尋味的胸次。他再還頭去瞧他的夫人，覺得他的夫人，已没有了處女美，深信女子的黄金時代，只有從發育完全到嫁之前夕的一個時期。見韓大少奶把雪花粉賞給了伊，伊接了，嫣然的一笑，靦覥附了一聲，無意中把眼波傾注到慕良的身上。慕良的眼波是好久没有移動了，兩下碰個正着。愛姑不能再鎭定了，一扭身就走，低下了頭，大概兩頰上色飛上了紅雲了。慕良感慨地説：（要是伊再受你一番薫陶，把伊在巴黎的香霧襄惚一個浴，怕不是一個（丫王）。　　韓大少奶聽了，自然狠得意，隔一回低低的説：（怕把你風魔了）</p>
<p>慕良仍舊乾笑了幾聲。好久没有對話支開了留聲機，聽幾張小調的唱片，這一個黄昏消磨了。</p>

<h3>上週美棉套賣漸减</h3>
<p>紐約四日電告一週棉市狀况云、本週原棉市場中之同業需求、包括國内及日本等外國在内、似足以吸收每日所有之套賣、查但買胃限於價格之低落、市價乃稍低、政治之不靖、限制一般貿易、顯有靜待發展之趨勢紐約與利物浦間、聞有因英幣匯價變化而起之若干公斷、利物浦方面在此或巳稍有買進、蓋以孟却斯德前途有更大之樂觀、而蘭開夏棉業工潮又有及早解决之希望也、最初四次開於十月底棉産地位之私人報告、平均爲一千一百五十三萬九千包、查上月同時平均估計爲一千一百二十七萬九千包、現棉基礎價格堅穏、内地售出比較無多、</p>

<h3>糧食標粉在劇烈變化中</h3>
<p>昨日粉市上午關盤後、各月份曾見鉅大之變化、初開時因洋麥報價回漲三四角左右、某廠亦從之抬價故開拍後、較前日回漲二三分、惟二盤後、因福阜兩廠一致楊出、且澳麥兜售、仍不見絶、自三兩五錢半至三兩五錢、隨時可以成交故市場空氣、恍如不　之舟任受打撃、自此之後、又步步狂落較開價跌二三四分不等、迨至下午開盤市面慘落情形、又甚於上午、因多數之多頭、以根本關係不能再擯、遂一致大斬、形勢之慘惡、爲自有交易所以來之第一次、如十二月份低至一兩六錢八分半、一月份至一兩六錢六分、二月份至一兩六錢六分半、三月份至一兩六錢八分、四月份至一兩六錢九分、均爲最低之新紀錄、旋聞花紗帮大戸收進、有意抬價、漸見回振、四盤以後交易見淸局面見定、至就世界農産之過剩、如生産者硬抬現貨、不使普遍流通、殆將自絶機也、結果本月份前日反好一分七厘半、十二月份小五厘、一月份小二厘半、二月份小五厘三四份小七厘半云、</p>
<h3>麥價期跌現平</h3>
<p>昨日期麥上下午開盤後、各月份均見不振之象、以洋麥報價雖好二三四角、但國外環境、依然不佳、且不久之將來、國外過剩、將移於中國、此種情形在漫無限制暢定洋麥之下、决須實演、所以人心惶惑交易雖不暢、市面則一致低落、此項趨勢如洋麥續定、恐尙須再疲耳、結果本月份及十二月份各跌三分、一二月份跌五分、三月份跌四分、四月份不動現麥市面略有做開價巳轉平、開高郵麥三兩二錢半、瑤灣麥三兩三錢二分賽應麥三兩二錢六分、共開四百餘担云</p>
<h3>芝加哥小麥回堅</h3>
<p>新豐洋行報告、週五（四日）芝加哥小麥、因紐約股市堅挺、及空戸補進、各期皆漲一·三七五分、又三日成交共三千萬蒲歇爾茲將四日行市列左</p>

<h3>絲茶廠經電報發出二百餘包</h3>
<p>本埠洋莊絲市、因海外絲價奇小、電轉寥落、絲銷疲滯已久、昨因匯市轉平、歐美各莊雖分向華絲商討發電報、而紐約廠經又跌四五十兩、Ｂ級價祗扯四百七八十兩、乾利達昌等共計發出絲電二百餘包、須俟下星期一·二電轉、方有把握實銷不動、昨祗信孚進川黄廠經十八包、又中和進八繭灰經三十包、</p>
<h3>抽芯珍眉法銷續暢</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊茶市、來路莊之抽芯珍眉綠茶、去路繼續暢達、英莊錦隆天祥等行、均因摩洛哥來電需求、搜買不遺餘力、市盤亦較前略爲堅挺、貢熙綠茶、俄國恊𦔳會仍未開秤、惟白頭莊裕隆洋行、進意依然濃厚、此外大帮中拆出之針眉鳳眉秀眉等花色、法莊亦略有去路、惟祁門紅茶、依然無人問及云、</p>
<h3>煤炭復州煤屑加税</h3>
<p>自僞國侵佔東北海關後、凡有東北來貨、槪須完納進口税、復州煤屑、因係奉天産、故財部令海關亦須照章納税、日昨本埠某公司裝來新貨一千五百噸、卽已完納但成本因之加重、昨日市場呌開盤子、每噸繠引起五錢云、</p>
<h3>糖市粗砂白走場呆木</h3>
<p>昨糖市以標金復見低落公會劃盤趨勢極爲疲軟二十四號粗砂白呌盤仍爲十四兩九錢機磨細砂白十四兩九錢但結果一無成交、已呈呆頓之局、二十號十八號中砂白及八九十號荷赤均乏上落日前太古公司濟南輪運到之土産二白糖一百三十包、昨已由建帮號家如數開出、價爲十三兩八錢、據聞客意須十四兩外、因有申市本廠貨軋脚故難達到云、</p>
<h3>南北貨龍口粉市價倒懸</h3>
<p>｜申銷呆滯｜</p>
<p>龍口線粉干、近以各方銷路呆滯、行盤轉跌二三錢、客貨亦無開出查前盤不上十九兩、現在各行走　淡溥、均乏進意、故行客雙方、絶無成交而地價高於申市、尤難合划、後市須俟銷方活動、方有總好希望、昨頭牌龍粉行售十九兩、烟台粉十六兩半、市勢疲軟云、</p>
<h3>油市新陳交替時之白桐油市</h3>
<p>白桐油出新己届、洋莊仍在若接若離、而襄古桐到漢時有所聞、致漢市依然以盤旋輾轉之狀態、遷延其時日、市面之不能發展、祇有維持現狀已可斷言、惟浙江方面各産地榨坊止亟亟於從事開始製造新貨工作、而市塲上望廉之空氣、非常後厘、據查各産桐子收價、則成本極　　合之上海　每擔二十二　稍零、故前日有抗州行家在申售開、冬至復解貨、期油六七百担、價格二十三元四六角之間、而現貨則二十四元二四角、乃據熱悉産地情形者報告、對於售開之價格、已屬低廉、若再跌價、則産地有成本關係、恐非所願也、本埠號家因鑒於銷塲不十分暢旺、所以亦不過於貪取、惟較漢桐似尙稍廉、故將來進貨、當注重於浙桐矣、</p>
<h3>五金昨開出三千餘担</h3>
<p>昨日五金市情、鬧靜互見、如英鋼板·新洋元·馬口織·新鉛絲等均有鉅大交易、聞成交總數達三千餘担之多、致各市行情均有扶搖直上之槪、英鋼板二厘半每担又估八兩二錢半、五厘六兩、七厘半五兩七錢半、比之前市莫不步步高升、而其採辦之較遲緩者、莫不有抱隅之嘆也、查購戸係靑島·天津長江各帮爲最踴躍、此外不遇問津而已、至於其他花色、若銅類·點錫·靑銅·三角鐵·路皮·新鐵絲等、均滯遲不動、是以市象前途、不免有寂莫之景象也、</p>
<h3>竹節鋼條加價一兩</h3>
<p>竹節鋼條、新近以市貨不多、出口鋭增、行情紛紛提加、計每噸統花色估六十七兩、比前提·加一兩、而本街空意亦正在發展、是以後途行情尙看再漲也、</p>

<h3>識相</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>夜闌人靜。於深巷狹路中。突聞。（識相些）。三字。没有一個不是口呆目定。毛骨悚然。識相的就把身邊袁頭等物摸出。雙手奉送。假定不識相。不免就要使你不好看。</p>
<p>識相二字。就是（見機行事）（看風把拕）之意。觀此名詞之風。行即可以知二字效力的偉大。我友趙塌公有言曰。走路要看紅綠燈。做人要學某某人。就是識相的意思。這事可以幹。去幹。這事不可以幹。就不幹此是識相。這人可以交。去交。這人不可以交。就不交。此是識相。這人可與談。去談。這人不可與談就不談。此亦是識相。</p>
<p>甲派得勢。我馬上調過頭來去和附甲派。這是識相。某乙得勢。我馬上改變面目。去交好某乙。這也是識相。識二字。看似容易。其實甚難。弄得不得法。識相就要變成不識相。十九路軍第五軍抵抗暴日。看似不識相。然而衆望所歸。便是識相。北方將領完全不抵抗。看似識相。然而爲國人所吐棄。便是不識相。</p>
<p>我更把古人兩件事來説。</p>
<p>戰國時。孟嘗君旣廢。諸客皆去。後復召之。孟嘗君太息曰文常好客。遇客無所敢失。客見文廢皆背去。如復見文者必唾其面。此亦是客之識相而不識相之一例也。</p>
<p>又王播少孤貧。嘗客揚州木蘭院。隨僧齋食。僧厭之。乃齋罷而後繋鐘播至已飯矣。後二紀。播鎭是邦。向題字。已碧紗幕其上。播作詩云。（上堂已了各西東。慚愧闍黎飯後鐘。二十年來塵撲面。如今始得碧紗籠。一此亦是和尙識相。而不識相的一例也。</p>
<p>古人所以有（馬屁拍在馬脚上）之語。孟嘗君客可謂識相矣。然而結果弄得不識相。和尙是最識相的。然而有時也要弄差。可知識相二字。談何容易。倘能處處識相。事事識相。方是全才。</p>

<h3>幾種化妝用品</h3>
<p>— 沈爾明</p>
<p>下列幾種化妝用品，摘錄於萬有文庫，因鑒於本刋讀者衆多，故介紹於下，以資普及，</p>
<p>香粉</p>
<p>香粉之主要原料昔爲鉛粉，然鉛粉有毒，久用必令面色灰敗而無血色，故今多改用锌白（即　化鋅）矣，下列兩種均爲上等白粉，</p>
<p>㈠氧化鋅五百公分，沉澱磚酸鈣三公斤，滑石粉五百公分，澱粉一公斤，茉莉香精三十公分，玫瑰香精三十公分橙花香精三十公分，麝香精七，五公分，將上列四種粉，研至極細，用極密之篩篩過，而後拌和，緩緩滴入香精，隨加隨　，不可過速，</p>
<p>㈡小麥澱粉七百公分，氧化鋅五百公分，滑石精四百公分，桂花香精十公分，玫瑰香精五公分，先將粉研細篩過混和，再加香料，</p>
<p>胭脂</p>
<p>玫瑰胭脂水，爲洋紅三十五公分，硇精水六十公分，玫瑰香精七十公分，玫瑰水二公升，先將洋紅研碎，盛於瓶中，加硇精水屢加振盪，置數日後加玫瑰香精及玫瑰水，更加振盪，置八日取上部淸液即得，</p>
<p>胭脂膏，爲洋紅三十公分，阿拉伯樹膠粉五十公分，滑石粉六百公分，或加玫瑰油適量，將上列各物置鉢中混和研之，略加水少許，調爲厚糊即成，</p>
<p>香乳Ｅmulion</p>
<p>普通香乳爲白色液體，不含游離鹼質，用以擦面，能使皮膚潔白柔嫩光潤，較胰皂爲優，</p>
<p>甘油香乳爲甘油二百五十公分，杏仁油四百公分，鯨蠟一百公分，白蠟三十二公分（夏天加倍），玫瑰水三百五十公分，玫瑰油四公分，將白蠟及鯨蠟在磁皿中熔融，徐加杏仁油及含甘油之玫瑰水，後加玫油即成，</p>
<p>雀斑香乳　爲樟腦五十公分，氣化錏二十公分，昇汞十公分，蛋白一百公分，玫瑰水一公斤，先將樟腦溶於少量酒精中，次將氧化錏昇汞及蛋白，分溶於水，徐徐混和攪　，得白色沉澱或乳狀，此爲治雀斑頗著效，惟有毒不可入口</p>
<p>脱毛劑depilatory</p>
<p>脱毛劑乃用以除去鬍鬚，胸毛等之藥，大槪爲鈣，鋇等之硫化物，脱毛劑之陳舊者效力減少，故須用新製者，脱毛劑能傷皮膚·用時應須謹愼·</p>
<p>㈠爲硫化鋇三公分，澱粉一公分，水適量，調成糊狀，塗布於布膚上，毛髮脱落後以水洗去，</p>
<p>㈡爲酒精十二公分，膠棉三十五公分，碘○·七公分，松節油一·五公分，蓖麻子油二公分，配合後厚塗皮膚上。　　㈢爲生石灰粉八公分，碳酸　一公分，硫化鉀一公分，以適量之水調和塗布，</p>
<p>染髮劑</p>
<p>醋酸鉛染髮水爲醋酸鉛三公分，一硫硫酸鈉十二公分，甘油三十公分，純酒精三十公分，蒸餾水四百公分·先將醋酸鉛與一硫硫酸鈉分别溶於少量水中，次加一硫硫酸　溶液於酒精，甘油，及水之混合液中不絶攪拌，復次注入醋酸鉛溶液·貯於藍色瓶中，經一日後取其澄液，每日刷頭髮一次，能漸漸轉黑，惟不可常用，因鉛質有毒也，</p>
<p>金髮水即二氧化氮溶液，有漂白力，能將頭髮漂成金黄色，初用時須用稀薄液，並須先以胰皂水將髮洗凈·再以淸水洗去胰皂然後塗之，</p>
<p>高錳酸鉀水爲高錳酸鉀一百五十公分，蒸餾水二公升，此乃褐色染髮劑，並可供染鬚之用·</p>
<p>手用品</p>
<p>手用化妝品，即用以塗手，使皮膚潔白及磨指甲使光滑者，</p>
<p>潤手脂爲含水羊毛脂三十公分，甘油二十公分，硼砂十公分，玉樹神油二公分，苦杏仁油一公分，將上列各物充分混和，塗手上，</p>
<p>磨指甲粉爲氧化鋅一百公分，滑石粉一百公分，澱粉五十公分，洋紅一公分，成爲三氧化錫之細末二公斤，香檸檬油十公分，薫衣草油十公分，洋紅二十公分，混和即成，</p>
<p>塗指甲水爲石蠟二公分，石油醚六十公分，令石蠟溶於石油醚中，再用朱草紅染爲桃紅色即成，用時用毛刷蘸之，塗於指甲上，</p>
<h3>爸爸媽媽息爭吧</h3>
<p>改良社會討論會</p>
<h3>改良家庭問題的結論</h3>
<p>— 慈民</p>
<p>改良家庭問題，雖有允宗，明星，卓雲，文炳諸君，先後在本刋發表意見，但因他們的立論，都只看到了問題的</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>一面，未能顧及全體，以致該問題延宕迄今，尙没有獲得適當的解决，殊屬憾事。</p>
<p>在他們共同承認（家庭制度的不良）這個大前提之下所發表的各别的議論中，很顯明的，我們可以爬梳出兩個異趨的頭：</p>
<p>一，家庭是社會的構成分子，社會如此腐敗，家庭制度的不良，實爲厲階。所以改良家庭，是改良社會的初步工作。這種由小及大的説法，是允宗與卓雲二君的主張。</p>
<p>二，家庭不能脱離社會制度而單獨存在，家庭制度的不良，實道源於社會經濟政治制度的不良。所以改良家庭，須先改良社會政治經濟的組織。這種由大及小的説法，是明星與文炳二君的主張，</p>
<p>第一種見解，只抓住了不良的家庭制度，能給予社會以不良影響這一點，而把産生這種家庭制度的社會基礎，完全忽視：第二種見解，却又倒過來，只説明了不良的家庭制度所由産生的社會組織，而把不良的家庭制度，給予社會以不良的影響這一點，完全抺殺。</p>
<p>所以我説他們都只看到了問題的一面，未能顧及全體。我認爲：家庭制度的確定，完全依存於社會組織，如對建的社會組織，便産生了聚族而居的大家庭制度，資本主義的社會組織，便産生了一夫一妻的小家庭制度，目前我國三不像的社會組織，便引起了小家庭與大　　　道的　　，道都　　一没約事實，决非允宗，卓雲的主張，所能打倒。但家庭　度的産　　雖茶於下曆的社會組織，衝家庭制度確定以後，牠必然的，也能給予牠自身所由産出的社會政治經濟制度以許多影響，這種例子，巳很多委很多，無待贅嘗。　　，文炳二君竟輕輕　　，也很不應該。</p>
<p>茲緣合二者的相互關係，列表如下：</p>
<p>上曆層家庭制度｜下層社會組織</p>
<p>是故我們要澈底改良家庭，必有待於社會組織之改良，在改良社會組織的途中，無論如何也擯不掉家庭所給予的影響。</p>

<p>（老三）被他的妻子喊醒了，也聽見鈴····的是電話·慌忙起來，忿恨的説；這時候啥人打來的斷命電話，拖着鞋走出去接。喂喂，你啥人呀。</p>
<p>（老二）喂，你阿是老三嗎？我是老二。</p>
<p>（老三）是的。你是老二嗎？喂喂，這時候你打電話來有啥事體呀。</p>
<p>（老二）喂喂，我來告知你，老大咋夜死了，請你趕快過來。</p>
<p>（老三）老大什的死了，喂喂，他患了什麽病，那有死得這樣的快呢？</p>
<p>（老二）喂，他没有患着什麽病，他是服毒自殺的。</p>
<p>（老三）唉｜·他受了何種剌激而自殺呢？</p>
<p>（老二）喂，昨夜一點多鐘的時候，我正好睡覺了，他的家裏遣人來喊我去，我問他啥事體來呌我去呢？他説：老大服毒了。這時候發着毒性，呌我快去設法。我聽了他這一句話，我冒着寒侵的風，立刻跑到他家裏，他在床上喊着好痛呀，好痛呀，不住的喊着。我問他，大哥，你爲什麽這樣的呢？問了他好幾遍，他開着眼看了我幾眼，流出來絡繹不絶的眼涙對我説｜唉｜老二呀，我做人不來了，説了句又不説了。我屢次的又間他，他説｜我在ＸＸ賭公司裏·輸去了好幾千塊錢·這幾千塊錢·還是店裏的莊票，我私自出了張莊票　　　　　　　我一時的糊塗，現在　過　巳經來不及了一　想來想去一，還是自殺痛快些·我死之後·把這幾個小孩子，請你和老三，安排他，照顧他。説到後來聲音喁喁的，聽不大淸楚了。這時我把救他的問題忘記了，趕快喊了黄包車、送他到醫院裏，經醫生灌了藥水·我問了醫生·他的毒可有救星嗎？醫生説他服毒已多，恐難起生，果然未到三個鐘頭，他啊唷的喊了一聲，竟死了。喂喂，你趕快過來呀。</p>
<p>（電話）　斷。</p>
<p>（老三）唉｜唉｜大哥呀，我屢次的呌你不要去賭，你反愈賭愈大了，現在這樣的棄了我們，呌我痛心不痛心嗎？</p>
<p>（老三的妻子）喂，你聽了這多時候的電話，啥人打來的呀。（老三）老二來通知我，説老大死了。</p>
<p>（老三的妻子）啊，我前兩天在馬路上碰見他的，他還笑着招呼了我幾句，什麽好好的爲死呢？害了什麽病死的呢？</p>
<p>（老三）唉，他是自殺死的，因爲賭去幾千塊錢，現在這樣的慘死，可憐不可憐嗎？</p>
<p>（老三的妻子）賭是最厲害的没有了，輸去了錢，這是不用説，而他的性命也輸去了，我常常的吩咐你，無論啥賭，不可去賭·小·費耗時日，大·傾家蕩産，現在分明了。他呌你快去，你還呆呆的立着嗎？</p>
<p>（老三）聽他妻子一話，忽忽的　　穿了衣走出去了。</p>
<p>只重衣衫不重人</p>
<h3>線春袍子</h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>近來我做了一件線春袍子。因爲在這（只重衣衫不重人）的社會中，我認爲一件値錢的衣裳對於我確有極大的帮助。</p>
<p>爲了衣裳的蹩脚，我曾受了許多人的奚落。當我有一次因事去ＸＸ館的時候，我膽大的走進電梯，我向那司機人説：</p>
<p>（三層樓。）</p>
<p>可是那司機人却向我週身打量一次，忿忿的説：</p>
<p>（什麽？三層樓也要坐電梯？到五層樓去｜）</p>
<p>在這聲吆喝之下我便一直升到五層樓，没有話説，只得從五層高樓再一步步的走下來。哎！我畢竟没有寛大的胸懷，我深深的嘆了一口氣。</p>
<p>從此我便苦心積慮的留了幾元錢，居然買了一件價値十二元的線春袍料。從大馬路回來，我感覺十二分的高興，我想：（現在我可闊起來了。）晚飯時，妻問我道；</p>
<p>（那末拿什麽料子做夾底呢？）</p>
<p>（啊！對了，還要夾底的。）我恍然大悟了。</p>
<p>但是那裏有錢呢？這眞使我爲難了。這樣我得向人去借貸，然而誰都没有在箱　　　待機會了，直到五　以前才僥倖　友人虚借到　元，買了夾底而且還預備了裁　工錢</p>
<p>昨天我穿了這件新夾袍走上ＸＸ　，坐着電梯到了三層樓復返身半着下來，司機的只是笑嘻嘻的不説一句話。我猜得準他一定在忖：</p>
<p>（啊！這是新的線春袍子。）</p>
<p>於是我感覺勝利了。</p>
<p>可是今天不幸得很，不懂事的小孩子却好端端的在我身上撒上一股尿，這對我是多麽重大的損失啊！於是眼見孩子的屁股給妻打得通紅，接上豆大的眼涙從她長長的睫毛中落下。</p>
<p>當然，我得小心的拿到洗衣作去洗滌，花了兩毛錢洗熨乾凈，可是那褪色了的痕跡却始終顯眼的留在着。哎｜十多元錢的線春夾袍｜·····也許是我命該如此吧｜</p>
<p>家庭問題</p>
<h3>勇敢的娘子軍</h3>
<p>— 霍人</p>
<p>今晨六點多鐘的時機，我從寗紹碼頭，接了一個鄉間的朝凌辦來。回爲没啥行李，也不雇車，談談説説，與沙的走着。走對中華路的一條街裏，國着許多人，望屋内觀看。不知看啥事體。我也走了近去。只聽見打碗碟的聲，　了一會。換了拍桌敲椅聲，從人叢中看進去，巳經打得落花流水了，還是一個女人打着，馬着，你這爛腐婊子，妖怪，把你迷了兩三夜，瞞着我做得好事，今早也洩漏了你的淫污機　。</p>
<p>駡了一陣，怒氣冲天的，把一個四十多歲的男子，鈕着他的胸襟出來了：口裏説着，快與我到家裏去，一邊駡，一邊押着男子走了。看這男子忍了頭，諒必是很怕老婆的。</p>
<p>屋裏：有二十左右的一個女子，這個女子，果然後　　·　係驚慌　床，　　　昨夜的風流：　的頭髮，　的　　，尙在鮮明，口裏也駡着脆的：。···聲音，　　······。</p>
<p>了聲旁人，知這個女子，是一個男子的小老婆。</p>
<p>他的大老婆。因爲男子數夜不到家裏安，努力的探聽着，在此地借了房子，辦了一個小老婆，聽着這個消息，大　了醋心，起早的來取被窠，果然被他取着了。説好去了·我與明友也走開了。</p>
<p>唉｜···，現在内裏外　，國難當頭，臥薪嘗胆的時候。可嘆···一般有錢的同胞，還醉在小老婆的懷裏作樂。唉｜唉！他的國，那裏來的國雖｜那裏在臥薪嘗胆的時候呢！</p>
<p>希望討小老婆的大老婆，努力的去操練娘子軍，作河東獅吼的奮鬥吧</p>

<h3>影劇作風的變遷</h3>
<p>— 榮克</p>
<p>電影劇界，最近發生了一個變遷，盛行一時的社會愛情和劇盜格局等影片，不久將成時代的陳跡，從前神怪堂皇的（十誠）（萬王之王）（戰地駕花）和（賓漢）之類的無聲影片上的劇本，又將應時而起了。</p>
<p>社會愛情和劇盜格鬥的事情，爲日常生活所司空見愼，電影上，把地們重複演映，不免使一般觀衆，日久生厭，觀衆心理上嗜好古時有聲有色的浪漫的豪俠的，歷史劇本，以長劍博取美人的芳心，比　用機關槍掃射，有意思得多，至少，這是大導演家西度地密爾的觀念。</p>
<p>地密爾根這個觀念，導演一本偉大的新片，呌做ＴheＳigooftheＣross他的眼睛，充滿着創作這本巨片的狂熱，對人説，（我相信人們看慣現在流行的影片，要討厭了，我將忘却現在和我們耳聞目睹的聲色，而描寫幾千年前羅馬光榮的史寳，你看了ＴheＳignoftheＣross的時候，你不僅對羅馬得着了一瞥，你會像親眼着到尼樂皇時代的羅馬一樣，在這本新片裏，尼樂時代的羅馬，一事一物，無不完完全全的，確確實實的，在你的眼前，一幕一幕的展開，其中有未經人們描寫過的最美麗的戀愛故事，因爲最有光彩的寳石，没有適當的背影，就成了死物，我所以把馬格斯同美茜亞的戀愛故事，描寫在影片上從未産生過的富麗堂皇的背景上。）</p>
<p>地密爾對人暢談的房間裏，散置着影片上用的無數佈景，堆積着的巨大書本，證明他創造這新片的參考工作，聽到地密爾口講指劃的人，不能不給他熱烈的人格和堅强的主張感動，在他滔滔不絶的口述中，人們好像又看見那羅馬都市的偉大景物，到了尼樂在皇宮裏，還有鬥獸塲血染的泥土上，人們又看見耶穌敎徒殉道者的肉體，在給餓獅的利爪斯裂，以供羅馬人的娛樂。</p>
<p>羅馬的光榮，强盛，殘暴，和奸詐，都給肉眼看到了，這此特點將來攝入了ＴheＳignoftheＣross、成爲一部恐怖而美麗的偉大劇本。</p>

<h3>可愛的他</h3>
<p>— 素以</p>
<p>改譯巴黎學生艶史蘭心大戲院正在映演的巴黎學生艶史原名ＪlestＣharlhant直譯爲（可愛的他），是一夠從法國的歌舞劇脱化出來的聲影。　　以情節而論，劇中所描寫的巴黎大學生的生活全復有照映出來。拉丁區Ｏualtierlatin特殊的風光，聖米瑟大街ＢoulevardＳtＭiche種種奇形怪狀，大學生的浪漫生活都没有描寫出來，大考中筆試和口試的作弊都不盡合理。</p>
<p>若言穿挿，則有輕歌與妙舞，男主角亨利加拉ＨenryＧarat本是歌舞劇的戲子出身，和全球聞名的希佛來有異曲同工之妙，女主角勒馬尼愛兒Ｌemmouniere本是巴黎一家歌舞劇塲的演員，所以兩人搭配，還不算勉强。其餘所有角色都是巴黎著名歌舞劇塲ＦolieＢere的舞男與舞女。一幕一幕的穿挿，活像巴黎盛行的短幕連串底歌舞劇。所以簡單一句話，這齣戲是以歌劇改變爲聲影吧了。</p>
<p>這齣戲中的設計有幾處値得贊美的；一點是荒蕩的大學生在大考的隔夜，夢中所見書桌上墨水瓶裏跳出來的安琪兒，羅馬法敎本裏滾出來的許多仙女，在書桌上大兜圈子；一點是一對情侶在大學院庭的許多名人石像下，談心，石像的頭都會眉飛色舞，唱起歌來；還有一點是壁上油畫的畫中人也會揮扇歌唱。這些並没有什麽大道理，然而妙在想入非非</p>

<h3>狩獵片的勃興</h3>
<p>— 燕南</p>
<p>電影是時代所産生的藝術，所以牠得跟着時代走，以前的大套偵探片，言情片，理倫片，以及戰事愛情片，武俠片等等，都一一落伍了，即一二年前的歌舞片，勢力也衰微了，一九三二起，所需要的是刺激，是恐怖和緊張，於是狩獵片，受到了優越的地位，</p>
<p>這一個潮流的興盛，不過一年吧，我們看一看，從人獸奇觀起，以至於猿虎記，菲洲小人國，人猿泰山，奇獸記，冰國大觀，那一片不是有呌座的絶大魄力？所以預料，此後必定更有這類的影片大量産生出來，</p>
<p>首倡攝中國狩獵片的，是黄奇溠，他本來是辦電影刋物的先進者，現任事藝聯公司，預計將成六張此種巨片，本刋前此，巳一再介紹，那末我們再看一看别的公司，</p>
<p>時代影片公司，是新組織，也許有許多人不知道吧？奇怪得很，第一片的攝製，就走上了時代的路，呌（到蠻野去），是朱血花導演的，主演的是著名舞星，李麗女士，據説不久出版，也許會赶在藝聯公司之先呢</p>
<p>還有（荒島野人記），比時代公司，攝得更早此，是快活林公司出品，由徐素貞和唐雪倩合演，我們固然知道，徐唐二女士是中國武俠片的著名人物，然而快活林公司，却很耳生，而且這片中，還有一隻和琳丁丁，明哥，一樣的好狗，呌茄莉，這也是國片創舉啊，</p>
<p>好消息來了，她的第一張有聲片（樂園之鳥）巳經到了上海了，她英語中，帶了她的土音，這是我們不會覺得討厭的，因爲希佛萊，不是帶法國口音嗎？但是我們覺得比純粹英國更可愛呢：　　這片是雷電華出品，名導演金維多的佳作，男主角是佐義麥克里亞，片巳到申了，許多人一定在盼望着，但是這是不幸的，影院老間們，知道這是熱門貨，大家在努力爭租，所以到現在還没正式解决，不知結果是那家走紅運的影院得勝利！</p>
<p>不過，决不致於再遲綖多少日了｜我們不久就可以在銀幕上看見這西班牙女郎了｜而且她還説了話了呢｜</p>

<h3>島葛拉斯的本事</h3>
<p>— 不敏</p>
<p>島葛拉斯范朋克的本、究竟不差、有的人這麽説、你看美國落杉磯開世界亞林匹克大會時、别的自命不凡的明星、到了亞林匹克村、高視闊步、東張西望、但是外國選手都不理睬他們、他們覺得索然無趣的去了、可是范朋克一來、情形就不同了、大家都喊着（這不是島葛拉斯麽：）於是大家就園攏起來、拿出他們的日記本子、請他簽名、留作紀念、這是都麽榮譽呀、因爲這些世界各國選手、都在影片中看見過范朋克的劍法拳法、跳躍如飛的本領、今日一朝見面、豈能不認識呢、可是前幾天范朋克到了上海、他向人説過一段故事、他説有一天、美國高爾夫球國手瓊斯在好萊塢打球、看衆無千無萬、范朋克他自已亦去打球、不久無千無萬的觀衆、看瓊斯、來看范朋克了、弄得瓊斯怪難爲情的、這段事情是島葛拉斯逢人即道、頗引以爲榮的、可是島葛拉斯在上海連打高爾夫數天、連戰連北、可見島葛拉斯雖到處轟動、實有他轟動人的本領、不必一定在武藝上或運動上勝人一籌也、</p>

<h3>評可愛的仇敵</h3>
<p>— 李陵</p>
<p>可愛的仇敵，是多麽動人的Thema、我被這題目，誘引了，很興奮地到中央戲院，我很想知道這個故事，同時也想瞻仰瞻仰程步高先生的新作。　　我是從來不顧意看國産影片的，這並不是我蔑視國産影片，不過我覺得費錢，消耗了時間精神，實在不能換得點甚麽來，換句話説，我是不需要看國産影片，然而這一次，我竟出乎意料之外，獲得相當的滿足了，我很愉快的，離開戲院，很愉快的跑回家裏，很愉快的起了一種感覺，我覺得中國的電影事業，一天一天的進步了，這是多麽可喜可慰啊。</p>
<p>我現在將我所見得到及想得到的都寫在下面。</p>
<p>可愛的仇敵的劇本，并没有多人意義，大約作者的心，不過欲暴露現代靑年男女的求愛狂，同時告訴我們友誼是怎樣誠摯而已。</p>
<p>劇的構成，就是一個平凡故長，很明顯地是，現代學生生活的縮影，對社會，對現時代的靑年，似乎還不夠力量然而劇的體材，很新頴，雖然缺乏藝術上的價値，但是同目前我國電影劇本比較起來，也算是鳳毛麟角了。</p>
<p>程步高的作品，從前也看過一本（落霞孤鶩，）但没有得到一點好的印象，（可愛的仇敵，）可以説是程步高先生的空前鉅作，全片中使我佩服的地方，就是處處不沉悶，而且有很多地方，都可以顯露演的才能，如趙有成與徐源祿搶像片的一幕，及徐源祿畢業後在趙有成的空床上，默想時的攝影角度等，都可以看到導演的技巧，然而這片並不是全璧，有幾處地方是欠理的，現在舉兩個最明顯的例。</p>
<p>一·徐源祿偷錶後，怎麽連自已親手掛起來的繩，都忘記解下，那有這般大意的人？</p>
<p>二·趙有成被看更的打了一棍，從墻上跌下來，拚命逃走，并没有同看更人糾纒過怎麽後來重映的時候，明明又是另外一幕？其餘還有許多徵少的缺陷，不過，在目前中國電影界，處處須受物質縛束，我們是應該原諒的。</p>
<p>其次要説演員了，演員中最好的，要算龔稼農，演來十分織細，無絲毫勉强的地方。　　鄭小秋的徐源祿，雖然活潑可愛，但有些地方，仍覺未足，表情太差，</p>
<p>梁賽珍王徵信都不像學生，或者兩位，都不適宜扮演這種角色吧。</p>
<p>其餘的演員，都没有好處，亦不覺得怎樣特别壞，綜之，此劇可以算是國産影片比較好的一部。十一月二日草於靖廬</p>

<h3>自有中國的標準美</h3>
<p>— 陳大悲</p>
<p>初學寫字的人免不了描紅字。以前的中國影片無非是買了美國人的紅字格來描描而已。現在我們要快抛棄了描紅格，去找我們最相宜的字帖來臨，我們的字帖在那裏呢？哈！這正合着（遠在天邊，近在眼前）的一句老話，我們的字帖是用不着到外面去買的，要研究銀幕上的表演藝術，凡是人類存在的地方，到處都是我們可以臨　的字帖，在你的自修室裏，在你的家庭裏，在你的親戚朋友家裏，在電車裏，在火車裏，在馬路上，在大街小巷裏，那一處没有你可以臨慕的字帖？　　你的目標是甚麽呢？不是要表演嗎？表演的秘密就在反映社會和社會和　現人生。社會上所有的一切顯露的大事，以至於一切隠微的細故，那一件不是値　得我們去悉心研究，刻苦揣摹的好資料？</p>
<p>卓别麟，李琳吉舒，吉寗　，諸人的表演藝術，都是由他們自己的環境裏琢磨修練出來的。他們並不是像我們從前一樣，由各人互相模彷而得來的。我們要把由我們自己環境裏琢磨修練出來的藝術，表演到銀幕上去，讓他們知道我們中國人並不全是一些縮頭縮臘，彎腰曲背，拖髮辦，穿馬啼袖的東方怪物，同時我們也可以讓我們國人看一看，不必垂眉，凹眼，高鼻，鬈髮，我們自有我們東方的，中國的標準美。這就是我們現在急須實現的獨創時期中最重要的工作。</p>

<h3>Aviation and National Defense Sincerity</h3>
<p>Since the invention of new-style weapons such as tanks and the advent of submarines, discussions of national defense have invariably emphasized the power of armies and navies. However, since the invention of airplanes in the last thirty years and their application to military affairs, the focus of national defense has shifted from land and sea to the air. (Without aviation, there is no national defense.) This is now a universally recognized truth in the world. American Air Force General Mitchell once said, "(In an air raid) when attacking a nation's key points, neither the army's intervention nor the navy's obstruction is feared by the air force. Only the air force can contend with it." When we carefully consider General Mitchell's words, we can perceive the great importance of the air force to national defense. Moreover, the power of the air force is sufficient to change strategies, preempt the enemy, and quickly determine the overall outcome of victory or defeat. Because in the air, one cannot dig trenches, and other devices connected to blimps and the installation of various anti-aircraft guns are only passive defenses. Once a battle opportunity arises, the one possessing a vast air force can fly to the enemy's key points and decide the outcome in one fell swoop. Neither the navy nor the army can easily exert their strength. This is when the air force fully demonstrates its power. Therefore, it is said that "(In an air raid attacking a nation's key points, only the air force can contend with it.)" Hence, it is said that "(Without aviation, there is no national defense.)"</p>
<p>Therefore, today, all the great powers are doing their utmost to expand their air forces and develop the aviation industry. The progress of the air forces of the major powers such as the United States, Britain, France, and Italy is self-evident. Even Japan, whose air force strength is less than that of the United States in quantity and less than that of Britain in quality, is making the utmost effort to promote the aviation industry, to a fever pitch throughout the country. Especially since the September 18th Incident, all public and private aircraft manufacturing factories in the country have been working day and night to manufacture aircraft. The donations from the people for the aviation industry are extremely enthusiastic. The donations for domestically produced "(patriotic planes)" and "(nation-serving planes)" have reached dozens of aircraft. The number of donations for other listening devices, anti-aircraft guns, and searchlights is even greater. At the same time, they are loudly calling for the people to build air defenses to protect Osaka, their sole industrial center. Their slogan says, "(If Osaka is attacked by enemy planes, it will be a matter of life and death for Japan.)" Furthermore, the strict training of juvenile aviation soldiers and the promotion of civilian aviation are all being done with utmost effort. In short, Japan's efforts for air defense have reached a white-hot level nationwide.</p>
<p>While the aviation industries of various countries in the world are making rapid progress, they are focusing all their efforts on air defense without the slightest negligence. In contrast, in our country, not to mention the civilian aviation industry, even the so-called air force is still in its infancy. The few aircraft scattered in several provinces are fragmented in strength and lack unified command. Moreover, the source of the aircraft is all purchased from foreign countries. In terms of air defense equipment, not only are various provincial cities, but also the important capital and key ports and fortresses completely unequipped. In terms of aviation education, there are only a few talented people who have returned from studying abroad and one or two newly established schools. Compared with the great powers of the world, the difference is far greater than that between the clouds and the mud. If we quietly contemplate the words "(Without aviation, there is no national defense)," we should immediately tremble with fear.</p>
<p>During the January 28th Shanghai Incident this year, the damage suffered by our troops and people from Japanese aircraft was extremely evident. Currently, the volunteer forces in various parts of the Northeast are also finding it very difficult to cope with the attacks and bombings by Japanese aircraft. If our country had a considerable air force, even if it could not launch an offensive, it would at least be able to contain the enemy aircraft and reduce their ability to cause harm. This once again proves the accuracy of General Mitchell's words, "(In an air raid attacking a nation's key points, only the air force can contend with it.)"</p>
<p>Therefore, we believe that it is absolutely urgent for our country to expand its air force and promote the aviation industry. First, we should focus on the development of the aviation industry with the united efforts of the whole country, raise capital, recruit foreign experts, establish factories for domestic production, formulate plans for step-by-step advancement, and intensify the training of aviation personnel. At the same time, the organization of civilian aviation should also be vigorously promoted. The command of the national air force and the development of civilian aviation must be absolutely unified and coordinated. Because without unified command and organization, even if a county has one airplane, its effectiveness is virtually nil. Exerting the utmost effort of the entire country to catch up with the great powers of the world is now the most crucial time. Only in this way can our country avoid the danger of being reduced to scorched earth by enemy planes, and only then can the survival of our nation be maintained forever.</p>

<h3>### Li Haiqing's Army Attacks Ang'angxi, Volunteer Army Besieges Anda and Laha Stations</h3>
<p>The South Manchurian Railway Station in Siping Street Was Burned Down by Volunteer Army</p>
<p>The General Headquarters of the National Salvation Army in Beiping Hailar telegraphed to Beiping, stating that Li Haiqing's army attacked the Ang'angxi station on the night of the 3rd, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. The Qiqiang light railway was destroyed by the volunteer army, and the troops have approached the provincial capital with great momentum. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>### Pu's Troops Are Advancing Towards Yangtun</h3>
<p>Military news from the Beiping Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang People's Support Association: We have just received a telegram from Su Bingwen in Hailar on the 2nd, stating that Deputy Commander Pu's troops engaged in fierce battles with the enemy on the eastern front on the 29th, killing many enemy soldiers. On the western front, more than 60 enemy cavalry were encircled by our forces and completely annihilated, capturing 56 foreign horses, 60 Mauser rifles, 1 machine gun, and over 1,000 rounds of ammunition. Currently, Pu's troops are working hard to advance towards Yangtun. The enemy in Fularji has been attacked by our forces twice, resulting in the death of one major, five or six lieutenants, and over 300 soldiers. The Japanese side, seeing the bravery of our army's attacks, is extremely fearful and demoralized. They are now uniting to besiege, and they will be annihilated soon. As for all the propaganda from the Japanese side, it is all fabricated. To avoid confusion, please clarify the rumors, etc. This is specially reported. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>### Volunteer Army Active in the Suburbs of Changchun</h3>
<p>A person from Changchun in Beiping reported that all officials in various organizations have both a regular and a deputy, with the regular being Japanese and the deputy being Chinese, to monitor them. Any slight carelessness will result in imprisonment and execution. The people are subjected to harsh treatment by the Japanese, which is unbearable. Therefore, the people are thinking of the desert. The volunteer army is active in the suburbs of Changchun, attacking the city from time to time. Gunfire is often heard, and officials and civilians inside and outside the city are quite panicked. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>### Volunteer Army Besieges Anda Again</h3>

<h3>### Tang Juwu Convenes Military Conference</h3>
<p>Tang Juwu's troops in Beiping are now concentrated in the counties of Jin Chuan, Meng Jiang, An Tu, Chang Bai, and Fu Song. Tang convened a military conference in Jin Chuan on the 27th of last month. Senior officers of each army rushed to attend.

<h3>### National Salvation Army Captures Dongfeng and Other Places</h3>

<h3>### Volunteer Army Blockades Food Supplies in Eastern Border Area</h3>
<p>Tang Juwu's unit of the National Salvation Army and the volunteer armies of Huanren and other counties in the areas of Shanhaiguan, Tonghua, Linjiang, Fusong, and Antu blockaded food supplies in more than a dozen eastern counties after the autumn harvest, prohibiting exports, distributing and storing supplies locally in preparation for a protracted confrontation with the Japanese army, taking the opportunity to attack Shenyang, and receiving financial assistance and sympathy from local residents. Because the area they occupy is surrounded by mountains, the Japanese army, despite concentrating forces and launching several attacks, has met with stubborn resistance, suffering losses in vain and making no progress. Aerial bombardments have had little effect because the area has many natural shelters. Tanks and heavy artillery cannot be used. Therefore, the banner of the Blue Sky and White Sun is still planted everywhere in the eastern border area. Currently, it is widely rumored among the Japanese in Shenyang that many volunteers have surrendered, but this is not the case. The Japanese army, struggling to find a solution to the volunteer army problem, is attempting to use propaganda to sever the volunteer army's support and cause the people to lose sympathy. It is heard that the Japanese army is planning to use a portion of its forces to advance along the Yalu River towards Tonghua, Linjiang, and other counties, attempting a coordinated attack. The National Salvation Army is also prepared. (5th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>### Liu Xiang's Army Pushes Towards the Border of Luzhou</h3>
<p>Liu Wenhui Telegraphed the National Government to Stop Liu Xiang's Troops from Advancing. Representatives of Various Sichuan Armies Stationed in Hankou Met with Zhang Qun to Discuss. Liu Xiang in Hankou returned to Yongchuan from Dazu to inspect, and issued another general attack order. The vanguard has approached the border of Luzhou, and a major war is imminent. Liu will still go to the front to supervise the battle if necessary and set a deadline for capturing it. The agreement between Liu Wenhui and Deng Tian has become a reality, and the Sichuan situation will be difficult to predict. According to Qiu Jia, Luzhou-Chuan will be occupied soon. Qiu denied that Deng Tian had reached a compromise with Liu Wenhui. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Liu Wenhui of Chengdu telegraphed the National Government and Chairman Chiang on the 3rd, saying that Liu Xiang, the commander of the Liu Army, had launched the Sichuan war, instructing Li Jiayu and Luo Zezhou, etc., to invade eastward. He had repeatedly telegraphed and reported, and had been repeatedly ordered by the central government to defend the original defenses. The decrees were clear, and they should be strictly followed. He believed that even if Xiang and others were extremely arrogant, they would not dare to deliberately violate the central government's orders, go against public opinion, and commit serious crimes. Therefore, he adopted the policy of calming people and putting an end to trouble, and following the instruction to defend the territory, he kept his arms down and hid his strength, showing that he could endure any grievance as long as he did not bring shame to his homeland. In the past ten days, he ceded Shunqing, then Suining and Tongnan, then Jiangjin and Yongchuan, and then Dazu, Anle, Yuechi, Lezhi, and Hejiang counties. The frontline generals, angered by his excessive concessions, were willing to die for the country, but he urged them to move westward, hoping to assist in implementing the order to avoid conflict. However, Xiang and others sharpened their teeth and pressed forward step by step, instructing their troops to actively attack his garrisons in Luzhou, Longchang, and other counties. He ordered the frontline generals not to engage in combat, but to withdraw as appropriate, showing that he had no intention of competing in the civil war. However, at this time, there was no more room for concession, and it was difficult to force his generals to stretch their necks and wait to be slaughtered. The reason why Xiang and others attacked him was simply that he was expected to be a destroyer of the so-called sixteen articles of the Sichuan governance plan privately drafted by them. Since he had been in charge of provincial administration, he had been sitting and listening to the separation of power and the freedom of division, so that political affairs could not be developed and the people were suffering even more. He felt guilty and had no time to boast of flashy words to decorate himself. Now, if there is a supreme plan to reform and save the situation, he would dare not follow it with sincerity. However, Xiang and others had premeditated plans and did not inform him, and then immediately used it as an excuse to attack. It is clear even to children that they are not sincerely seeking governance, but using it as an excuse to start a war. If Xiang and others are truly remorseful, he believes that the most important thing to consider is why the Sichuan situation has been mired in the mud for years. Is it because a few opportunists each harbored ambitions to carry out separation, and then each carried out tyranny to prolong their lust? Only by taking the splitting of land and seizing power as the cause can we get the result of the people being scattered and the government being lazy. Once the conscience is aroused and the plan is changed, who would not be as good as me in doing good? The great road is easy to find. There is no need to use it exclusively, and branches and knots arise. In his humble opinion, it is now necessary to take the law as the basis, promote the realization of civil rule, and first of all return the military and political powers of Sichuan Province to the central government, waiting for disposal, sweeping away the root of the disaster for twenty years. Secondly, the reorganization plan has been promulgated by the central government long ago, and each should follow the actual number of reorganizations, all reorganized and directly under the central government, eliminating local characteristics. Thirdly, the chairman of the provincial government, the central government also has a resolution to rely on, and should be reorganized by the central government in the future. Once the three are set, the evil habits of the defense area can be permanently eliminated. Whether it is Chengdu, Chongqing, Wanxian, or Kuixian, all can be directly under the central government, and the troops should not be garrisoned as before. It seems that the military and civilian affairs each have their own responsibilities, so that the finances of the province are all open, the budget is discussed and decided, and the overall plan is unified and supported. There is no competition for each other, and there is no worry that A is fat and B is thin. The suffering of the people can be eliminated, and the burden will naturally be reduced in the future. In addition to the provincial government, a three-member council for military affairs, political affairs, and construction should be specially formed. The central government should appoint leaders of various armies, elders of various circles, and famous scholars from abroad to discuss and implement plans under the supervision of the central government and the people, and after being examined by the central government. Once the foundation is established, the details will be revealed. The main points of the reform of political affairs will be clearly displayed like the sun and the stars. In short, the Sichuan disaster has been going on for a long time, and the disaster has been deeply rooted. The desire for governance has long been hoped for by the public. The method of governance does not need to be specialized, but the concern is that the military officials are evil and protect their faults, and the extreme tolerance and tolerance lead to the accumulation of habits and mutual governance, which is more and more intensified, and few can extricate themselves. Those who know the situation are sighing together. Now that the green meeting is mature, who dares to generate it from outside? It should be requested that the central government seize this opportunity, make a decisive decision, and immediately strictly order Xiang and others to stop the advance of the western expedition. On the one hand, it is also requested that a special commissioner be sent to Sichuan to convene a special committee to investigate the above-mentioned matters and jointly formulate the implementation procedures and wait for approval and implementation. In this way, the war atmosphere will be resolved, the Sichuan disaster will be permanently alleviated, and the central government's grand plan to stabilize the southwest to stabilize the country will be achieved. The opportunity is urgent, and I look forward to your judgment. I am waiting for orders with reverence. Liu Wenhui, Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Government, knocked on Jiang Yin and other words, respectfully requesting a unified claim for justice and promoting peace, Liu Wenhui knocked on the emblem seal (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>News from the Dadao Society in Nanjing reported that Liu Wenhui ceded Shunqing to Tian's troops and Anshan to Deng's troops. Recently, the troops of the 21st Army have advanced to the two counties, and Tian and Deng are quite dissatisfied.

There is a one-touch trigger situation. 4) The two warships of the Chongqing side, Bayu and Yangtze River, led by Commander Jiang Kui, arrived in the vicinity of Zhuzhou County to cover the army.

<p>Deng Xihou of Tianshui in Beiping yielded Suining to Yang Sen. Yang expressed his willingness to cooperate with Deng and withdrew the troops from Penglai Town. Liu Xiang's plan to attack Luzhou was exhausted, and because Yang Sen's attitude changed suddenly, it was not implemented. The air of peace in the Luzhou-Yongchuan area is gradually thickening. Liu Xiang ordered a large number of machinery and ammunition in Shanghai, which could not be transported to Chongqing. Liu returned to Chongqing on the 2nd to arrange rear military affairs. Liu Cunhou united the second-level generals and telegraphed a ceasefire. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Laiyang and Yexian Can Be Relieved by the 11th</h3>
<p>Liu Zhennian's Troops Will Be Transferred to Eastern Hubei</p>
<p>Han Fuju of Jinan said that because the navy only arrived in Yantai on the 6th to take over the defense, the Yantai troops must arrive in Yexian before the Yexian troops can withdraw. Otherwise, the Yantai troops cannot pass. Therefore, Laiyang and Yexian must be relieved and withdrawn by the 11th or 12th. It is impossible to withdraw completely before the 8th. After the withdrawal, the provincial administrative personnel will not move, and the committee monitoring the withdrawal of troops will guarantee safety. Xiong Bin is the monitor of Liu's withdrawal, and he has been telegraphed to Liu yesterday. He will go to Yexian after receiving a reply, probably after the 10th. Division Commander Zhan Shutang came to Jinan to report on the situation of suppressing the Communists in Rizhao and Zhucheng.

<h3>House of Anti-Reactionary Leader Toyama Mitsuru Raided</h3>
<p>Shiba-yama Principal Confesses Inside Story of Tenko-kai Organization</p>
<p>Toyama Mitsuru's Son Arrested in Connection with the Inukai Assassination Case</p>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Reuters) - Police raided the home of anti-reactionary leader Toyama Mitsuru and one of his organizations this morning, discovering a major conspiracy. Several people have been arrested, including Toyama Mitsuru's third son, Toyama Hidezo. Toyama Mitsuru has great influence and is highly respected by ardent patriots, so the authorities have not dared to infringe upon him lightly.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Denstu) - The Metropolitan Police Department, in conjunction with the Procuratorate, has been unusually tense for several days due to the autumn grand maneuvers. At 5:30 AM on the 5th, Inspector Yoshioka and seven subordinates in steel armor arrested Toyama Hidezo (age 26), the leader of the Tenko-kai, Toyama Mitsuru's third son, in Asagaya, Suginami Ward, and seized numerous related documents. Meanwhile, five squads of police officers formed by the Procuratorate, together with a squad from the Metropolitan Police Department, searched Toyama Mitsuru's residence in Shibuya. The other four squads searched the residences of those involved and arrested those involved. The reason is that members of the Tenko-kai demanded that Yoshigoro Akanuma, the central figure in the gas suspicion, prepare election expenses for candidates of the Tenko-kai in the February election, threatening and extorting several thousand yen. The incident is very complicated. Shiba-yama Principal of the May 15th Incident gave six pistols to those involved, confessing that they were supplied by Hidezo, which is why the police are active. Due to his involvement in the May 15th Incident, he will be forcibly imprisoned soon on charges of murder and violation of gun and gunpowder control. Among those accused is Yoshioka Makoto, well-known as the former captain of the Waseda University cheering squad. The Tenko-kai recommends Toyama Mitsuru as its chairman, with Hidezo in charge of practical affairs, and Shibata Tokujiro, the president of Kokushikan University, as a supporter. It is a nationalistic right-wing group with students from various universities such as Meiji University, Takushoku University, and Kokushikan University, and it is supported by the Genyosha and works with the Ko Sakura Society. Toyama Hidezo, influenced by his father Mitsuru, is a young man of courage and accomplishment, not the type to engage in intimidation. Hidezo's involvement seems to be only in the ideological aspect. Police officers and prosecutors who searched the Tenko-kai headquarters on the third floor of the Showa House and the residences of the Yawata Club seized three pistols and numerous important documents.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Reuters) - After raiding Toyama Mitsuru's Tenko-kai this morning and arresting Toyama Mitsuru's third son and three other members, six members of the Independent Youth Association were also arrested. It is said that these six people are involved in a plot to destroy the Tokyo Electric Power Company and plunge the city into darkness and to assassinate certain important figures. It is now believed that the two organizations are cooperating on this plot. However, the detention of Toyama Mitsuru's comrades is clearly still related to the extortion case.</p>
<h3>Lytton Will Speak to Members of Parliament on the Political Situation in China</h3>
<p>London, 5th (Reuters) - Lord Lytton will speak to the Conservative Party Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Commons on November 9th. The committee's China Subcommittee will be chaired by Earl Winterton on that day. It is heard that members of Parliament familiar with Far Eastern affairs are paying close attention to the section of the Lytton Report that states that the political instability of China is the root of all troubles. It is expected that Lord Lytton's speech will focus on this point.</p>
<h3>Matsuoka Visits Russian Dignitaries with Twofold Mission</h3>
<p>One Side Attempts to Persuade Recognition of Puppet Organization</p>
<p>One Side Inquires About Attitude Towards League of Nations</p>
<p>Soviet Union Proposes Treaty Terms</p>
<p>Not Acceptable to Japan</p>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Kokumin) - Although Yosuke Matsuoka's extensive visits to Russian dignitaries in Moscow are said to be merely friendly and informal talks, all major Japanese newspapers, including those close to the government, are hoping that this move will yield significant results. According to newspaper reports, the main objectives of his visit to Russian dignitaries, in addition to negotiating a non-aggression treaty, are roughly two: one is to explain the relationship between Japan and Manchuria to the Soviet Union and dispel Russian suspicions; the other is to gauge the Russian government's attitude when invited to participate in the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting to discuss the Lytton Report and to communicate with them in advance. In addition, after dispelling Russian suspicions, he will seize the opportunity to use the cooperation in the development of Manchuria as bait to persuade the Soviet Union to recognize the puppet organization. It is said that when Karakhan was stationed in Beijing as the Ambassador to China, he knew Yosuke Matsuoka. Since the two have old friendships, it will not be difficult to speak freely this time, so the Japanese have high hopes for Matsuoka's talks in Russia.</p>
<p>Moscow, 4th (Kokumin) - According to reliable sources, Soviet Deputy Foreign Commissar Karakhan told Yosuke Matsuoka, the Japanese representative to the League of Nations, that he hoped to see the early signing of a Japanese-Russian non-aggression treaty. It is also heard that Karakhan expressed sympathy for this treaty but made some proposals that Matsuoka could not fully accept. Initially, the two expected to talk for 30 minutes, but it was extended to two hours before they parted and agreed to continue the meeting tomorrow. After meeting with Karakhan, Matsuoka visited Foreign Commissar Litvinov. The content of the talks is unknown, but they also lasted nearly an hour. It is expected that the main issue discussed was the non-aggression treaty.</p>
<h3>Gandhi Plans to Fast Again If the Treatment of Untouchables Is Not Improved</h3>
<p>List of British Representatives for the Round Table Conference Released</p>
<p>Bombay, 5th (Reuters) - Gandhi has again declared that he will fast if caste Hindus do not fulfill their promises to improve the treatment of lower castes. He will fast starting January 1st if the famous Guruvayur Temple is not opened to lower castes starting in the new year. This temple is the sacred site of the orthodox Hindu sect, and the temple board may not easily agree. Therefore, Gandhi's second fast seems inevitable.</p>
<h3>French Arms Reduction Plan</h3>
<p>Unifying International Conscription System</p>
<p>Establishing the Basis for Equality in Armaments</p>
<p>Paul-Boncour's Remarks Gain Widespread Sympathy</p>
<p>Havas, Geneva, 4th - In the lounges of the Disarmament Conference, general discussion focuses on Paul-Boncour's presentation of the French plan, which is purely technical and avoids all political and emotional viewpoints. This approach is widely appreciated. Paul-Boncour's explanation emphasized the essential outlines of the French plan, stating that foreign personnel assisted in drafting it. This revelation made a particularly favorable impression. From today, the British and American delegations have expressed support for the French representative's stance. This is because Paul-Boncour repeatedly stated that the French plan is primarily intended for European continental nations, with other nations free to join or not. At the very least, the mutual assistance and uniform military system aspects should be viewed in this light. Most European delegations are temporarily silent, with the Italian representative declining to comment. Although the German representative was unable to attend, German individuals in the lounges expressed no negative opinions regarding Paul-Boncour's presentation. The boldness of the French plan has surprised German figures. This gives us great hope that once the French plan is formally submitted in writing, the current deadlock at the Disarmament Conference can be broken. A significant event also occurred during the Disarmament Conference Bureau's afternoon discussion of the Belgian representative Bourquin's report, namely, the issue of on-site inspections by the International Arms Inspection Committee. Not only did France, Poland, and the Netherlands support this, but Britain also expressed sympathy. However, Britain introduced a reservation, namely, that this inspection method should be made permanent. This means that if a country makes an accusation or the Standing Disarmament Committee decides to conduct an inspection, Britain has already acknowledged this, a concession of great significance for the future of disarmament, needless to say.</p>
<h3>Papen's Radio Address: No Intention to Relinquish Power</h3>
<p>Urges Voters to Vote for Government Party</p>
<p>Vehemently Attacks the National Socialist Party</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 4th - Chancellor Papen made an urgent appeal to voters via radio tonight, urging them to vote for Hugenberg's faction, which supports the cabinet, and not to vote for parties opposed to the government. Papen explicitly discussed the relationship between the cabinet and the nationalist faction, which is a first. Another point worthy of our attention is that while Papen strongly attacked the National Socialist Party in his speech, his wording was still cautious, leaving room for future negotiations with the National Socialist Party. Papen concluded by stating that the government would continue to carry out its duties with a firm attitude.</p>

<h3>Berlin Traffic Still Paralyzed</h3>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 4th - Although the arbitration body issued a ruling on the strike issue last night, nine buses resumed operation today. Eight of these were blocked and destroyed by striking workers. Members of the National Socialist Party and the Communist Party are both assisting the strike. The tram strike has once again caused serious disruption. Last night, in some areas, such as the Schöneberg district, the public joined forces with demonstrators, and the disturbances took on the character of riots. A small number of passengers on the trams were forced to disembark by the public, and some drivers were also mistreated. In several places, the public even erected barriers on the streets and damaged the streets, making it impossible for vehicles to pass.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 5th - Although the police authorities are actively trying to restore various types of transportation in Berlin, the strike continued as before this morning. After the bloody riots last night, fewer than a thousand people volunteered to work as volunteers this morning. Although the company tried to restore services on the most important routes, it only led to clashes between the police and the strikers. However, the police were able to stop the strikers' resistance, so trams filled with passengers were traveling on the main streets.</p>
<h3>Minister of the Army's Bold Words</h3>
<p>Japan Will Not Perish Due to Poverty</p>
<p>Like Climbing a Steep Slope: Not Advancing Is Retreating</p>
<p>Next Year's Budget Deficit: 700 Million</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 5th - Minister of the Army Araki told people after yesterday's cabinet meeting regarding the budget issue, "The world believes that the Army's new request for military equipment improvement funds is intended to rescue small and medium-sized businesses. This is a big mistake. The Army has considered the comprehensive national defense, national strength, and financial resources and believes that this is indispensable. It has not considered rescuing small and medium-sized businesses. If we give way, all the efforts to date will be wasted, just as we are about to fall short. We should not be stingy with 500 million or 1 billion. Japan is like a strong young man, demanding working capital. When working, it is natural to sweat and toil, and even suffer minor injuries. However, it can recover within a few years. Japan will definitely not perish. It is like climbing a steep slope. We are only sweating. If we stop suddenly, we will retreat instead of advancing. Once we think of this, the problem will immediately be resolved."</p>
<p>China United Press, Tokyo, 5th - The Japanese budget proposal has been distributed to various ministries today. The ministries expressed dissatisfaction upon receiving the assessment documents. The Army and Navy are the most dissatisfied and immediately convened meetings of their respective bureau chiefs to discuss how to respond. It is said that Minister of the Army Araki is the most indignant, saying that it is essential to demand full approval. It is reported that the amount of money that the provinces are requesting to be restored is at least 270 million yen or more. If this is the case, the deficit for 1933 will be over 1.05 billion yen, excluding other special expenses.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 5th - The Finance Minister has drafted the budget proposal for the next fiscal year, with expenditures totaling 2,110,000,000 yen and revenues totaling 1,330,000,000 yen, leaving a shortfall of 780,000,000 yen, which will be covered by issuing public bonds. The expenditure items include a new budget of 600,000,000 yen and a regular budget of 1,510,000,000 yen. The new budget includes 320,000,000 yen for the Army and Navy's new requests and 160,000,000 yen for emergency relief programs.</p>
<h3>Kanazawa Brigade Reduced to Ashes</h3>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Kanazawa, 5th - At 7:00 PM yesterday, a fire broke out in the kitchen of the 3rd Company of the 7th Infantry Regiment of the 9th Division in Kanazawa. Fanned by strong winds, the barracks of the 3rd Company were completely burned down in an instant. The fire spread to the barracks of the 6th and 7th Companies, which were also quickly consumed. The barracks of the 1st and 2nd Companies were also affected. The fire was still burning this morning. The headquarters of the 7th Division and the headquarters of the regimental district were nearby, and the Kanazawa City Hall and the Ishikawa Prefectural Office were not far away, posing a considerable danger. Fortunately, the fire brigade and the youth corps cooperated in extinguishing the fire, and the fire gradually subsided. The regiment is currently conducting maneuvers, and most of its members have been dispatched to the Toyama area, with only a few remaining behind.</p>
<h3>Italy Sends New Warship to Shanghai</h3>

<h3>No Progress in US Wheat Loan Negotiations</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 4th - There has been no progress in recent days in negotiations for China to purchase 15 million bushels of American wheat on credit.

If the loan is not established, the plan to purchase wheat will likely be abandoned.</p>
<h3>English Monk, Chao Kong, Not Free from Worldly Desires</h3>
<p>Served as an Enemy Spy During the European War</p>
<p>Recently Arrested in Germany for Fraud</p>
<p>Havas, Colombo, 4th - The notorious spy, Trebitsch Lincoln (i.e., the monk Chao Kong), was recently arrested here. Lincoln is one of the most extraordinary figures in the European War and its aftermath. He is intelligent, proficient in several languages, and was a member of the British House of Commons during the European War while simultaneously working as a spy for Germany. In 1916, General Kitchener, the British Secretary of War, was entrusted with an important mission and boarded a ship to Russia. The ship was torpedoed and sunk by a German submarine shortly after it set sail. It is said that Lincoln was involved in this incident. After the end of the European War, Lincoln was expelled from the country by the British and Allied authorities and fled to Germany. Most of the events in Germany involved Lincoln. In recent years, Lincoln disappeared to China and became a monk at the Jing'an Temple in Shanghai, taking the Dharma name Chao Kong. Within a year of entering the temple, he became the abbot. Lincoln also seems to have been involved in recent political events in the Far East. This summer, Lincoln traveled from China to Germany, claiming to be preaching Buddhist principles but in fact carrying out some mysterious political plan. A few weeks ago, Lincoln traveled from Germany to Belgium and was immediately expelled by the authorities. A certain Dutch company is currently accusing Lincoln of defrauding the company of 5,000 marks. The police arrested him yesterday when he came here to give a lecture. Although Lincoln is in Europe, he still wears monk's robes and calls himself a "divine man," but plainclothes police in most countries are closely monitoring his movements.</p>

<h3>The League of Nations Special Conference and the Japanese-American War (Continued)</h3>
<p>(Written by Japanese Navy Lieutenant Commander Tōta Ishimaru, translated by this newspaper)</p>
<p>Mandated Territory Issue</p>
<p>If Japan withdraws from the League of Nations, what will happen to the mandated territories in the South Pacific? Could this be a cause of war? Further details will be provided in a separate article. Here, I will only state my conclusion: legally speaking, these mandated territories should be interpreted as not belonging to the League of Nations but to the five major powers of Japan, Britain, the United States, France, and Italy. However, in international politics, political considerations are often necessary, and legal considerations have little power. Therefore, although Japan relies on legal theories as a backing to oppose the return of these territories, if foreign countries oppose it, especially if the United States opposes it, the outcome will become a matter of strength. Unresolved disputes over this issue could lead to war.</p>
<p>However, this does not mean that Japan will withdraw from the League of Nations and then war will be triggered by this issue alone. This issue will only further fuel the already dangerous atmosphere towards Japan in the League of Nations and the United States. It must be combined with the anti-Japanese pressure policies mentioned in the second and third sections below to become a supplementary mechanism to promote war.</p>
<p>China's Retaliation Against Japan</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the direct results of this League of Nations Special Conference do not seem to pose a risk of triggering war. However, what we should be wary of is the change in the League of Nations situation after the League of Nations Special Conference is held. If the Chinese side allows Japan to negotiate directly and shows a willingness to make major concessions during direct negotiations, and if the United States changes its anti-Japanese Eastern policy and adopts a pro-Japanese policy, then war can be avoided. What good fortune that would be! If not, and China resolutely retaliates against Japan, and the United States continues its current attitude, then, unless other major events suddenly erupt, war will break out around 1935.</p>
<p>The worst-case scenario for Japan resulting from this League of Nations Special Conference is when China refuses direct negotiations, or even if negotiations are allowed, China is unwilling to make any concessions. At this time, direct negotiations have ended in failure, and China has decided to resort to retaliatory measures against Japan.</p>
<p>For example, using large-scale policies to disrupt Manchuria and a large-scale economic boycott of Japan are all extremely severe retaliatory measures. The former will leave Japan with no other option but to send troops into China, occupy key locations such as Peiping and Tianjin, and continue to occupy them so that China will not dare to have any further intention of disrupting Manchuria. Then the problem will transform and become even more serious, repeating the Shanghai Incident, leading to the intervention of other countries. When the Shanghai Incident was at its most intense, how acutely sensitive were the nerves of various countries? We Japanese should still remember it clearly. If second and third Shanghai Incidents follow one after another, corresponding to the first occupation of Peiping and Tianjin, with the Japanese army occupying many important locations in mainland China, can other countries sit idly by? Then the prelude to a world war will be about to begin immediately.</p>
<p>Some commentators in our country have said that China, having learned its lesson from the Shanghai Incident, will not dare to create a second Shanghai Incident and bring trouble on itself. However, from China's perspective, if it can involve various countries in the Sino-Japanese war, China can use foreign hands to repel Japan. Therefore, the optimistic theory of some people has lost its value and is not worth taking.</p>
<p>Nine-Power Treaty Conference and Four-Power Treaty Conference</p>
<p>If this League of Nations Special Conference does not use any sanctions against Japan, or if it uses sanctions based on the League of Nations Covenant and Hoover-style sanctions but they are ineffective, then the United States will continue its current policy toward Japan and seek the second stage of its anti-Japanese pressure policy. Especially if China takes retaliatory measures and the situation in the Far East becomes increasingly bad, calm American public opinion will also become heated, and it will inevitably support its government's second stage of anti-Japanese pressure policy. At this time, the US government will finally have the opportunity to take a proactive stance.</p>
<p>The so-called second stage of policies to pressure Japan will not go beyond the following two: (1) convening a Nine-Power Treaty Conference on China, and (2) convening a Four-Power Treaty Conference on the Pacific. The original intention of the United States in convening these conferences was to use these conferences to solidify the bond between Britain, the United States, and France and to jointly restrain Japan. However, if there is a proposal to convene such a conference, Japan can resolutely refuse to participate, needless to say. Because, from a legal perspective, according to Article 7 of the Nine-Power Treaty and Article 2 of the Four-Power Treaty, the contracting countries can only notify and negotiate. Countries that receive a notice from the United States are not obligated to agree to the US measures. For this reason, even if our country puts the received notice on the shelf, it will not violate the treaty at all.</p>
<p>If Japan refuses to participate, the convening of the conference will ultimately fail. The result will only make US-Japan relations increasingly worse, and the danger of war will lurk within it.</p>
<p>The 1935 Disarmament Conference</p>
<p>If the convening notices for the Four-Power Treaty and Nine-Power Treaty conferences are rejected, the only recourse for the United States is to wait for the 1935 Disarmament Conference.</p>
<p>The naval limitations and Pacific defense limitations stipulated by the Washington and London Naval Treaties will expire at the end of 1936. The conference to create a new disarmament treaty to replace these treaties should be convened in 1935. I believe that the United States will use this conference to try to exert final pressure on Japan. Naval arms reduction is certainly on the agenda, but the Manchurian issue will also be specifically raised and a settlement requested. What kind of disarmament proposal the United States will put forward at that time can be roughly gleaned from the Hoover disarmament proposal recently submitted to the League of Nations. This disarmament proposal was not established in the League of Nations because it focused on opposing Britain and Japan. However, now that Britain has expressed a willingness to compromise, this Hoover disarmament proposal will be the most important topic at the 1935 Disarmament Conference, and the main focus of this disarmament proposal is to completely block Japan's naval power.</p>
<p>Regarding the Manchurian issue, the United States will cite Japan's precedents in Shandong and Siberia and use the aforementioned Hoover-style sanctions as a shield to demand that Japan return Manchuria to China or impose minimal restrictions on Japan's interests in Manchuria.</p>
<h2>Page 9</h2>
<p>Continued from Special Article</p>
<p>Since Japan already knows that the United States harbors such intentions, it is not impossible for Japan to refuse to participate in the 1935 Disarmament Conference altogether. If this is the case, the United States, on the one hand, will declare that Japan has refused to participate in a peace conference, and on the other hand, since the Washington and London Treaties will expire at the end of 1936, - according to the treaty provisions, the notice of abandonment should be given two years earlier in 1934 - it will directly move towards a large-scale expansion of its navy and do its best to complete the preparations for the Philippines and Guam, making rapid progress. Then the relationship between Japan and the United States will suddenly revert to the situation before the Washington Conference, and the opening of the war will be approaching moment by moment. At that time, Britain will also be forced to follow the United States and be drawn into the vortex of the Japanese-American war. The result may trigger a Second World War. This whole armed conflict will start with the Manchurian Incident, the Pacific War between Japan, Britain, and the United States will be staged in the middle, and the Second World War will be the finale. It is truly a war chain drama. The tragedy and horror of the scene will be a hundred or a thousand times greater than that of Manchuria and Shanghai. How could the original instigator have dreamed of this?</p>
<p>Since I have already seen the worsening of the situation and no matter what methods are used, except for returning Manchuria, war cannot be avoided, then delaying the time will only increase the disadvantage for Japan, needless to say. Moreover, in terms of the ratio of naval power and the state of the economy, Japan is better off fighting a quick war. Then, rather than waiting until after 1936 and waiting for others to attack me, wouldn't it be better to strike first before 1936? This is why I have the outrageous argument that the sooner the war starts, the better.</p>
<p>The Path Japan Should Take</p>
<p>If this League of Nations Special Conference takes the most dangerous path in dealing with Japan, then Japan should move forward courageously with the determination to fight a war and fulfill its original purpose.</p>
<p>Conversely, if the current situation is relatively favorable to us, then Japan must also greatly change its policy and show the world the utmost sincerity of peace-loving. Only then will it not lose its position as a wise nation-builder. Other things, such as advocating militarism and allowing soldiers to be restless and presumptuously try to influence national policy, will ultimately bring disaster to the country, no matter what the circumstances. It is difficult to guarantee that the tragedy of Germany will not be repeated. We must repeatedly reflect on this.</p>
<p>Japan is now standing at a crucial fork in the road between war and peace. It must not be constrained by narrow local views and traditional xenophobic ideas. It must focus on the general trend of the world to manage national affairs, so as to win the final victory. This is also what I earnestly hope for from our government and our people.</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Japan Feels Northern Manchuria is Tricky</h3>
<p>Unable to Cope with Su Bingwen's Army</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from Beiping: Yesterday, I received a letter dated the 28th from a friend in Harbin, stating that Japan believed that the Northeast Three Provinces would be theirs without much effort. They thought that as long as the Japanese army arrived and there were a few Chinese traitors to act as internal collaborators, there would be no problem. They could shape it however they wanted and arrange it as they pleased. Moreover, they considered that they had been operating in Southern Manchuria for over twenty years, and not only did they have military power to control everything, but they also controlled the economic power, mostly under the guidance of the Japanese government and military. Therefore, they assumed that annexing the Northeast Three Provinces would be very convenient. However, after the September 18th Incident, the annexation policy has been tested for a year, with many tricks played, from the Public Security Maintenance Association to the puppet government, and through many tools used by Japan. Now, even ordinary Japanese adventurers are personally taking office in the puppet state, but the general situation has not improved, and there is no hope of improvement. Even the minimum level of security cannot be maintained. The South Manchuria Railway, which used to be the safest and best-managed railway, is now almost avoided by everyone. Even those who must travel by train are extremely cautious, because along the route, there is a disturbance almost every day or even every hour. Robberies and battles were once things that Japanese newspapers and local authorities paid close attention to, with monthly statistics. Railway disruptions or delays were considered emergencies. Now, people are almost used to it. Japanese authorities, for the sake of appearances, have banned newspapers from publishing news about traffic disruptions, but the general public still pays close attention to this matter, and the resentment towards the Japanese is deepening day by day. Many people who were previously dissatisfied with the Zhang regime and had pro-Japanese sentiments now realize their past mistakes, and the flames of national sentiment are reigniting. Therefore, many troops in the puppet state have different intentions. The Japanese army still places them on the front lines, using machine guns to supervise them from behind, but defections still happen every day. The vast wilderness of the Northeast provides ample space for such activities.</p>
<p>In Southern Manchuria, transportation is relatively convenient, making it easy for the Japanese to transport supplies and mobilize reinforcements. Therefore, large-scale volunteer armies cannot easily gain a foothold. However, the situation is different in the north, especially with the recent uprisings of Su Bingwen and Zhang Dianjiu's armies, which are most interesting. For over a month now, the Japanese army in the area from Harbin to Qiqihar includes the entire Himeji 10th Division, approximately 20,000 troops, along with other special units. The total number of Japanese troops north of Changchun exceeds 30,000, but they dare not attack Su's forces (the National Salvation Volunteer Army).</p>
<p>The reason why they dare not attack, according to the Japanese themselves, is that over two hundred Japanese soldiers are imprisoned in the Hailar-Manzhouli area, and over three hundred Japanese women and children are being held there. If the Japanese army launches an attack, these hundreds of people will lose their lives. Therefore, they must first rescue the detained people before using force. In reality, the reasons for not using force are: first, the Japanese army itself is already tired of fighting for the merit of warlords; second, the Northeast region is too vast, and a small number of troops cannot easily defend it. If a large number of troops are mobilized, it would cost a huge amount of military expenses with little gain; third, the Chinese Eastern Railway has relations with the Soviet Union, and using force along the Chinese Eastern Railway would provoke unexpected disputes at a time when Japan is seeking to maintain good relations with the Soviet Union. Moreover, the commander of the Soviet Far East Army is pro-war, so how can Japan not be concerned? Therefore, Japan can only talk about peace with the volunteer army in the western section of the Chinese Eastern Railway and even invite the Soviet consul to help rescue the detained Japanese. The front line of the Japanese army is in Gannan, and there is no sign of advancing westward. Their demands on Su are:</p>
<p>1.  Immediately cease the anti-Manchu and anti-Japanese attitude.</p>
<p>2.  Withdraw the troops along the railway and return to the original defense, without hindering traffic.</p>
<p>3.  Appoint Su Bingwen as the commander of the Hulunbuir Garrison.</p>
<p>4.  Supply the Su army with military expenses of 200,000 yuan.</p>
<p>5.  Immediately and unconditionally release the detained Japanese.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Su did not budge and continued to actively prepare, with Deputy Commander Zhang Dianjiu as the vanguard. They also established a government in Hailar, and their front-line troops, in the Zhu Jiakan-Nianzishan area, built trenches to prepare for battle. They also detained two Japanese reconnaissance planes and five crew members, including Major Watanabe. The Japanese military and political authorities in Longjiang and Harbin are very anxious and have sent two bombers and one fighter plane to carry out intimidation, but none of them have returned. It is said that they were all shot down. On the night of October 27, about 500 volunteer soldiers launched a night attack on Longjiang, fighting until dawn, and then retreated due to being outnumbered. The volunteer army is very mysterious, so the Japanese are very wary of the Chinese in Harbin, especially those from inland, fearing that we will respond to the volunteer army.</p>
<h3>Sudden Changes in Sichuan Situation</h3>
<p>Liu Wenhui and Deng Xihou Establish New Understanding</p>
<p>Chengdu Conference to Negotiate Ceasefire Terms</p>
<p>Liu Xiang Goes to the Front, Dividing into Three Routes to Attack Luzhou and Neijiang</p>
<p>Correspondent from Hankou: The internal war in Sichuan Province, caused by the rivalry between Liu Wenhui and Liu Xiang for supremacy, has been fueled by neutral generals who are adding fuel to the fire in order to reap the benefits. For the past month, in addition to the clashes between the two armies, there have been alliances to overthrow Liu (Wenhui), proposals to break up defense zones, the initiation of the Suining Conference, and the implementation of armed mediation. All kinds of strategies and intrigues can be described as extremely volatile. Until recently, the inside story of this false alliance has gradually been revealed, and the Sichuan situation has suddenly changed. At the beginning of the conflict between the two Lius, Liu Wenhui's strength was superior to Liu Xiang's. Liu Xiang sent representatives everywhere to win over Deng Xihou, Tian Songyao, Liu Cunhou, and Yang Sen, advocating the theory of an alliance to help himself. Deng, Tian, Liu, and Yang, knowing there were benefits to be gained, readily agreed. However, when the war broke out, the only troops engaged in combat were the direct subordinates of the two Lius, Luo Zezhou and Li Jiayu, while Deng, Tian, Liu, and Yang remained on the sidelines. Liu Xiang, now in a predicament, had to fully attack, wanting to resolve the 24th Army in one fell swoop, and then slowly deal with Deng, Tian, Liu, and Yang. Although he still outwardly promoted the alliance, in reality, they were already at odds. Liu Wenhui saw through his intention and tried his best to befriend Deng and Tian, promising to cede Ziyang and Jianyang counties to Deng and Tian's troops for defense. Deng and Tian, both from the Baoding Military Academy, had always been allies, and many of their subordinates, division and brigade commanders, were also graduates of Baoding. They had an inseparable relationship. Although Liu, Deng, and Tian had recent disagreements, they were not deep-seated enemies. Once the misunderstanding was cleared, they could resolve their grievances and become friends. Therefore, after receiving Ziyang and Jianyang, Deng and Tian's attitude changed immediately. They have now established a new understanding with Liu Wenhui and negotiated ceasefire terms, calling for the Chengdu Conference. Yang Sen, secluded in a corner, having already sent troops, wanted to get a share of the pie to increase his defense area, so he is also brewing to join. Liu Cunhou, the oldest of all the generals, had both Lius as his subordinates. Liu Wenhui is willing to divide the land among Deng, Tian, and Yang, and would certainly not leave out this old man. In this situation, Liu Xiang, who sees himself as the leader of the alliance, has been forced into isolation. However, although Liu Xiang knows the situation is precarious, he is not willing to submit. In recent days, he has continuously mobilized his troops, dividing them into three routes to advance towards Luzhou and Neijiang. On the third day, he went to the Yonglu front to慰劳his troops and encourage a fierce attack. At the same time, he has also been vigorously publicizing victories to boost his prestige. Yesterday, on the third day, another telegram of victory arrived in Hankou, disclosed below: 1. The enemy in Longchang retreated in large numbers towards Neijiang on the afternoon of the Eastern day, and a small number retreated towards Niu Fu Du. Our army is in pursuit. 2. Our army's units of Yang, Li, Luo, and Zeng arrived in Anyue on the 31st to await orders. 3. Deng's unit telegraphed that they have received Chen Shuhong's unit, but Chen Hongwen's unit needs to wait a little longer due to environmental reasons before they can return. 4. Deng led a part of his troops out of Ziyang and Jianyang to receive Chen Hongwen's troops and to block the enemy's retreat. General Tian will lead the majority of his troops to help Deng open the eastern route to complete the second phase of operations. 5. Taking Ziyang and Luzhou is just around the corner. 6. Although the enemy's fortifications in Da'anfang have several layers, they are very weak. We heard from the locals that our artillery will definitely hit the target. It is said that when the enemy retreated, our迫擊砲 hit their headquarters, killing and wounding over twenty people. This caused panic throughout the entire line, and they fled in droves. 7. Xu Jianxiu's旅 in Jiangjin has now taken in one regiment. After the loss of the north shore, Mu's troops抄 their rear twice. The enemy soldiers abandoned their guns and hid near Jin City. Our army seized many guns, so Xu's旅 only has one regiment left. 8. The enemy is most afraid of airplanes. One bomb was dropped on Wanshou Palace in Luxian, where a company was stationed, injuring dozens of people. 9. The enemy's morale is low, their combat power is weak, and they are afraid of the air and naval artillery. 10. According to the telephone call from Guo and Fan's two brigades, the enemy mostly fled to Neijiang, and a part retreated to Niu Fu Du. The gentry of Longchang requested our army to enter the city, etc. On the night of the 31st, Wang's troops used broadswords to charge and made a silent night attack on Lin Yungen's troops. They charged into Baohua, killing many people. Lin fled in panic, and his headquarters lost everything. 11. Yang's旅 in Hejiang was attacked by our army's Ba Yu and Yangtze River warships and Liao's旅 and Mu's南 shore detachment. The enemy abandoned the city and collapsed. We immediately occupied Hejiang. 12. According to the telegram from Yang, Luo, and Li in the north, the armies分道 attacked Anyue from Suining and occupied Anyue at 3 PM on the 31st. Special delivery. Liu Xiang bows and seals. It is heard that Chairman Chiang has repeatedly ordered a ceasefire and peaceful resolution of the Sichuan incident. Dai Chuanxian and Zhang Qun, two members of the Central Committee who are responsible for resolving the Sichuan situation, arrived in Hankou on the 4th by the Minquan warship and Jihe merchant ship, respectively. They will mainly use Premier Sun Yat-sen's telegram to Sichuan military generals in 1922 urging them to stop fighting and兴实业, as well as the decree issued by the National Government in 1928, as the standard for resolution. Once they meet with Chiang and discuss it, a decision can be made. (November 4)</p>
<h3>Dai Chuanxian and Zhang Qun Arrive in Hankou</h3>
<p>Correspondent from Hankou: Dai Chuanxian arrived in Hankou at 4 PM on the afternoon of the 4th, taking the Minquan warship from Nanjing, accompanied by his wife and secretary Chen Tianxi. At the same time, Zhang Qun also arrived from Nanjing by the Jihe轮. Both men have a major mission to resolve the Sichuan matter. Reporters visited them separately. According to Zhang, the resolution of the Sichuan issue can still apply to the various articles stipulated in the 1928 National Government decree. He is here to visit Chiang and discuss the implementation plan. He will stay in Hankou for about seven or eight days and then return to Nanjing. A trip to Sichuan is temporarily difficult, and so on. Dai's remarks were more detailed, roughly as follows: Question: What is your mission in Hankou? Answer: I have not seen Mr. Chiang for a long time. This time, I am going to Luoyang, so I am detouring to Hankou to visit. There is no special mission. I am not responsible for any special political responsibility today. Question: What is the mission to Luoyang? Answer: The government is now in Luoyang. Although most of the government affairs are handled in Nanjing, it is only a liaison office in Nanjing. This time, the chairman is returning to Luoyang and invited me to go with him. Several projects are urgently needed to be taken care of and it's essential that I go in person. Question: When will the Third Plenary Session be held? What are your opinions? Answer: The Central Committee has decided that the Third Plenary Session will be held in early December. The Standing Committee is responsible for all preparatory work. I have no special proposals, but after the closing of the National Assembly, the Japanese invasion occurred, and the implementation of the Provisional Constitution was hindered. The focus of this plenary meeting should be on national defense and the implementation of the Provisional Constitution, which is very obvious. Question: What are your opinions on the Sichuan matter? Answer: My opinion on the Sichuan issue was reported at the Central Memorial Week this week. The fundamental solution should follow Premier Sun's telegram to Sichuan military generals in September 1922, urging them to stop fighting and兴实业. The short-term solution should follow the articles stipulated in the decree of the National Government on November 7, 1928. As for the relationship between the people, I can only hope that the people of Sichuan will be completely aware and start anew. As for the past rights and wrongs, they are forgiven. The future rights and wrongs should be based on the above-mentioned Premier's遗训 and government 朋令. Then it can be hoped that everyone will join in the renovation. Question: What are your opinions on foreign affairs? Answer: All current observations are concentrated on the report of the investigation team. I am completely in agreement with Mr. Wang's opinions expressed when he went abroad on this point. There are no special insights. Question: What will be the future work of the Examination Yuan? Answer: The construction of the examination system cannot be achieved in a short time. What is needed is for the entire government to have the determination to establish the examination and selection system. Then, one achievement can be made at a time. The first foundation lies in銓叙, especially requiring that administrative heads with power in the central and local governments all have the same understanding and the same determination. It cannot be achieved by the power of the Examination Yuan alone. As for the establishment of the system, all official regulations related to銓叙 must be thoroughly organized. Regarding考选, the academic system and examination system should be comprehensively planned in the future, and then a good system can be established. Whether I am in charge of the government or resting in my hometown, I will definitely devote my efforts to research and contribute to what I can, so as to completely complete the overall structure of the national examination and銓叙 system within one or two years. Question: How long will you be staying in Hankou? Will you go to Changsha? Answer: Not yet determined. But there are no special circumstances. I will probably turn north in a day or three.

<h3>Navy Regularly Goes to Yantai to Take Over Defense</h3>
<p>Correspondent from Jinan: After the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs issued a formal order to resolve the Jiaodong dispute in winter, Han Fuqu yesterday telegraphed the generals in the front line to prepare to withdraw the defense, after the navy arrived in Yantai and Longkou to take over the defense. The provincial army will begin to withdraw, except for a small number of troops stationed in Pingdu and Changyi, and a small number of民團 stationed in Muping and Rongcheng. The remaining troops will return to their original defense and wait for Liu Zhennian's troops to leave Shandong. As for the supervisory members sent by the central government, in addition to Jiang Bocheng in Jinan, Gao Lingbai is in Qingdao and has not returned. He is scheduled to return to Jinan at 7:00 AM on the 4th. Xiong Bin will also arrive in Jinan at 6:10 PM tomorrow (4th). This afternoon, I visited Jiang Bocheng at the Central Bank and asked about the withdrawal of defense. Jiang said that Gao Lingbai will return to Jinan soon, and after a brief contact, he will return to Qingdao and go to Yantai with the navy to supervise the exchange of defense and the deployment of Liu's troops. Xiong Zemin (Bin) will also arrive in Jinan tomorrow and go to Yexian to supervise the 20th Division. I am stationed in Jinan to supervise the 3rd Route Army. I have always trusted the 3rd Route Army, and I think the 3rd Route Army will not deceive me. However, the navy is scheduled to go to Yantai from Qingdao on the 5th to take over the defense and will arrive on the 6th to take over the defense. The 3rd Route Army will start withdrawing from Yantai in about 7 days. The military department ordered that the withdrawal of defense be completed before the 8th. It is feared that the time will not be enough, and the deadline may be extended by a few days. It is also unknown. After the withdrawal of troops is completed, Liu Zhennian will be transferred out of Shandong. As for where Liu's troops will be transferred to and which troops will be used to fill the defense of Jiaodong, it has not yet been determined. It is heard that Gao Lingbai has agreed with Shen Honglie in Qingdao and decided to send the镇海舰載陸戰隊 to Yantai on the morning of the 5th. Gao will also go with the warship.</p>
<p>Yantai and Longkou, the provincial army is about to withdraw the defense, and the navy will temporarily maintain治安. After Liu Zhennian's troops arrive, they will be reorganized slightly, and they will wait for the central government's order to be transferred away from Shandong via Yantai and Longkou. It is heard that the provincial government received a telegram from various organizations in Yantai yesterday opposing Liu's troops passing through Yantai to leave Shandong. The telegram is as follows: (Chairman Han Jun鉴, it is reported that Liu's troops will be transferred via Yantai and Longkou. It is found that most of Liu's division is concentrated in Yexian and Laiyang counties, which are not far from the port, and cars can directly通胶济铁路. Land and water deployment are convenient. Since the central government is determined to transfer Liu's troops, it should order Liu's troops to temporarily驻 Yexian and Laiyang areas, concentrate and wait for orders, and limit the time to leave Shandong. There is nowhere unsuitable to go. But it is heard that the authorities are still considering the location and date of Liu's deployment at length, and first delineate the two districts of Yantai and Longkou as Liu's troops' retreat route. In Longkou, it is close to Yexian and Laiyang, which is still excusable. If Yantai is in a remote location on the eastern border, there is no reason for Liu's troops to detour there for any deployment. Moreover, Liu's troops' return to Yantai is not limited in time, and the name is to调离 Shandong province, but in reality, they are temporarily stationed in the original defense. It is to put the wishes of one person over the interests of the people. How can the government bear to do this? It is even more concerning that Yantai Port is a mixed place of Chinese and foreigners and is only separated from Lushun and Dalian by a strip of water. The enemy is watching for an opportunity to move. If Liu's troops' deployment is improper, causing major disputes, who will be responsible? I implore you to resolutely preside over the situation and quickly ask the central government to announce the location and date of Liu's deployment and directly order Liu's troops to leave the country via Yexian and Laiyang, so as to avoid disputes. The local area will be very fortunate. Yantai's various organizations and 150,000 people叩) (November 3)</p>

<h3>The Power of the Red Bandits in Henan, Hubei, and Anhui is Eliminated</h3>
<p>Correspondent from Hankou: The forces of the Red Bandits Xu Xiangqian, He Long, and Kong Hechong, after the National Army's general suppression, have been defeated in succession for several months. Now, the forces of He and Kong have gradually decreased. Xu's bandits are still in Xichuan. A few days ago, they窜 to Jingziguan, attempting to enter Shaanxi, but were blocked and returned to Xichuan. They are currently being surrounded and suppressed by the armies in northern Hubei and southern Henan. He Chengjun has also ordered Generalissimo Chiang to be stationed in Laohekou to command everything. He will go to Xichuan to supervise the army in a few days, and the remaining bandits can be wiped out. Before the general suppression, the Red Bandits attacked cities and seized land, and their勢 was extremely rampant. How long has it been before they have collapsed? Since the suppression of bandits, there has never been such a rapid success, which is also unexpected by the Red Bandits. The period from the猖獗 of the Red Bandits to their覆没 can be divided into five stages: 1. The period of全盛 of the Red Bandits: This was before May of this year. The area where Xu's bandits were盘踞 was the border of the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, east to the counties of Liuan, Shucheng, and 舒山 of Anhui, south to Guangji County of Hubei, southwest close to the county towns of Macheng and Huangpi, west to Huayuan, Xiaohexi, Guangshui, Wushengkai, Jigongshan, and Liulin,迫近 the Pinghan Railway, north to Guangshan County of Henan,逼近 the county towns of Huangchuan and Gushi. Huang'an, Luotian, Yingshan, Shangcheng, and Guangshan were all估据, and the seven or eight tenths of their entire territories were occupied. The counties of Huoqiu, Huoshan, and Macheng accounted for the seven or eight tenths. The counties of Guangji and Huangpi accounted for the two or three tenths. Jinjiazai and Xinji were the main bandit nests, and Huang'an, Hekou, and Xuanhuadian were the secondary bandit nests. Shangcheng and Yingshan were all the main forces. This force was the most充 and occupied the most land. The area where He's bandits were盘踞 was the counties of central Hubei, east along Tianmen, Yuekou, to the village of Zhurushan and Yong'an埠 of Hanyang, to the vicinity of Xindi, south to Yuezhou, west to Jiangling, Haoxue, Zifusi, to Jingmen, along the曰口 of Zhongxiang County, north to Jingshan. It is estimated that Qianjiang County was completely occupied, most of the counties of Jingshan, Tianmen, Mianyang, and Jianli were occupied, and a small part of the counties of Jiangling, Zhongxiang, Jingmen, and Hanyang were occupied. On one side, it approached Wuhan, and on the other side, it雄视 Yuezhou. The襄河南北 was even more within its勢力范围. The main bandit nests were Qianjiang, Honghu, and Bailuhu, and the secondary bandit nests were Zhuhe and Fengkou. This force was also 充, but the land it occupied did not leave Hubei. The area where Kong's bandits were盘踞 was the border of southern Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi, east to Paishi, south to Hunan and Jiangxi, west to Tongshan, and north to Wang Sanxi口. Yangxin County and a part of Tongshan Dazhi were completely occupied, and Longgang and Yanxia were important bandit nests, and Sanxikou was an important gateway. This force was slightly weaker and occupied less land. The three forces stood鼎足,互通聲氣. Not only were the three towns of Wuhan威脅, but also the traffic on the Pinghan and Jinpu lines and the two rivers of Changjiang and Xianghe were in danger of being destroyed at any time. This was the極盛 period of the Red Bandits. 2. The period of漸衰 of the Red Bandits: This was after May. The National Army had already begun the general suppression, and some of the lost land in central and eastern Hubei had been recovered, and the勢 of the bandits was gradually declining. However, the land occupied was still not small. It is estimated that Xu's bandits occupied the northeast to Huoqiu County, east to Liuan and Huoshan, southeast to Taihu and Qichun Liugonghe, Qishui Tuanbo, Huanggang Shahe to Macheng County, west along Zhongguan驿, Song埠, Wang Huangpi to Yanzigang, due west along Jigongshan, Wusheng Pass, Xiaohexi, and Xiyanggang, still与 the Pinghan Railway. It is estimated that the four counties of Yingshan, Luotian, Shangcheng, and Huang'an were all occupied. A part of the counties of Liuan, Huoshan, Huoqiu,潜山, Taihu, Susong, Guangji, Qichun, Qishui, Macheng, Huanggang, Huangpi, Xiaogan, Guangshan, and Luoshan were occupied. He's bandits occupied the area in the east, north, and south, which was roughly the same as before. West to Zhang Jinhe in Jiangling, Qianjiang County was completely occupied. Kong's bandits occupied the same area without change. At this time, it was the beginning of the National Army's進剿, and the situation in southern Hubei was quite沉寂. 3. The period of重創 of the Red Bandits: This was in June, July, and August. Xu's main force was repeatedly撃渎 and suffered heavy losses. Bandit nests such as Xinji and Huang'an had been abandoned. The occupied land extended from Taizimiao in Huoshan County in the east to Xiangtanhe in潜山County in the southwest, from Jinjiapu in Yingshan County, Xijiapu in Luotian County, to Shuangliushu and Shawo in Guangshan County in the west, and from Magang and Zhang柏岭 in Gushi to Kaishunjie in Huoqiu and Dushan镇 in Liuan in the north. Compared with the first two periods, it was far from相侔. The area occupied by He's bandits recovered seven or eight tenths during this period. The bandits were only divided into two forces, one据 Shigumiao集 in Jingmen County, one据 the Honghu Lake at the border of Jianli and Mianyang. There were a few scattered bandits据 Zhang Jinhe. It was already四分五裂 and not forming an army. At this time, the area occupied by Kong's bandits was shrunk from Sanxikou in the north, Pai Tang市 in the east, and Hengshitan in the west compared to the previous period. 4. The period of流窜 of the Red Bandits: This was in September and October. Xu's bandit nests were all lost, and they窜 to Huangle Village in Huoshan County. He's bandits窜 to Nanzhang County, and Kong's bandits窜 to Wanzai County. Important bandit nests, such as Jinjiazai, Honghu, Longgang, and Yanxia, were all recovered by the National Army. The Red Bandits had no base to speak of. Only a few scattered bandits出没 in Shawo in Guangshan, Xiadian in Huangpi, Hekou in Huang'an, Tuochuan埠 in Jianli, Zhang Jinhe in Jiangling, and Yinzu and Dafan in Dazhi. 5. The period of消灭 of the Red Bandits: This was in October. Xu and He's two forces流窜 and joined forces in Chengjiahe, Xiangyang, and were in a狼狈不堪. The destruction was in sight. The scattered bandits in Huangpi in eastern Hubei, Tongshan in southern Hubei, and潜山 in western Anhui can also be殲滅. In summary, the three Red Bandits of Xu, He, and Kong, He and Kong's勢力 have been completely散. Xu's bandits still存 several thousand people and are surrounded in Zhichuan. There are no signs of large Red Bandits in Hubei Province. (November 3)</p>
<h3>Suppression of Communists to Shift Focus to Borders of Jiangxi, Zhejiang and Fujian</h3>
<p>After remnants of Zhu De and Mao Zedong's bandit forces infiltrated Northern Fujian</p>
<p>They colluded with bandit gangs led by Fang Zhimin and Shao Shiping in Northeastern Jiangxi</p>
<p>Recapturing bandit lairs in Southern Jiangxi will not be a problem</p>
<p>The most difficult issues are post-conflict management and self-defense</p>
<p>Nanchang dispatch: Zhu De, Mao Zedong, and Peng Dehuai failed in their northern invasion of Yihuang and Le'an, and after fleeing back to Ningdu and Xingguo, Guo Bingsheng, the commander of their so-called Second Division, surrendered to the National Revolutionary Army. The National Revolutionary Army jointly blockaded the communist areas and their so-called Soviet areas, such as Xunwu, Huichang, Ruijin, Yudu, Xingguo, Shicheng, Guangchang in Southeastern Jiangxi, and Yongfeng, Jishui, Ji'an, Le'an and other southern areas. For years, these places had been drained of resources, and it was difficult to sustain the communist presence there. Therefore, Zhu De and Mao Zedong convened a so-called Central Conference in Ningdu, where the following decisions were made: 1) To greatly reduce and reorganize the Red Army; 2) Before Chiang Kai-shek and his main forces arrive in Jiangxi, to launch a large-scale invasion of Northern Fujian to find supplies and establish new bases to break the economic blockade. After this decision, Zhu De and Xiang Ying, in the name of the puppet Military Commission, reduced the original five army corps to three. Lin Biao was the commander of the so-called First Army Corps, commanding the Second and Fourth Armies. Peng Dehuai commanded the so-called Third Army Corps, commanding the Fifth and Seventh Armies. Luo Binghui commanded the so-called Fifth Army Corps (some say Dong Zhentang held the position of commander, but the original commander was Ji Zhendong, a traitor under Sun Lianzhong, who has been confirmed to have been killed), commanding the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Armies. All other units that were not full-fledged armies were reorganized into independent regiments and independent divisions. Luo Binghui's so-called Twenty-second Army remained directly under Zhu De's command. After the reorganization of the bandit army, funds were lacking. The official rations for the Red Army were 13 cents per day, while miscellaneous troops, such as independent divisions and guerrillas, received 6 cents per day. In reality, they were owed for months, and even a few copper coins for daily vegetables could not be paid. With nothing left to rob or search, the communist bandits were forced to urgently infiltrate Fujian. Before mid-last month, Zhu De and Mao Zedong concentrated their main forces in the Shicheng, Ninghua, and Guangchang areas, and invaded Northern Fujian in three routes. The central route, led by Lin Biao, directly invaded Jianning and Jiangle. The right route, led by Luo Binghui, attacked Ningdu and Shaowu. The left route, led by Peng Dehuai and Sheng Daiyuan, attacked Lichuan (which has since been recovered) and Guangze. The so-called headquarters of the Third Army Corps was stationed in Kangdeng, at the border of Lichuan, Nanfeng, Guangchang, Jianning, and Taining. Their mission was to protect the Jiangxi border to defend against attacks from the National Revolutionary Army in Nancheng and Nanfeng, with no intention of occupying Lichuan for long. Therefore, the so-called Fifth and Third Armies, and the Twenty-first Division, after plundering Lichuan dry, withdrew, intending to lure the National Revolutionary Army into the communist area of Guangchang for battle. At that time, Li Yunjie, Mao Bingwen, and Pang Kexiang had strong fortifications near the Fujian border in Nancheng and Nanfeng, adopting only a defensive posture and not pursuing the bandits. According to recent news from the front, the communist bandits, realizing that it was difficult to survive in isolation, mostly reorganized into smaller units. For example, Kuang Jixun merged with He Duan, and Kong Helong merged with the so-called Eighth Army in Western Jiangxi. Lin Biao and Luo Binghui, after occupying Jianning and Taining, actively expanded northward through Jiangle, Shaowu, and Guangze, hoping to join forces with Fang Zhimin and Shao Shiping on the border of Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Anhui, concentrating their forces to expand the communist area and consolidate the Jiangxi-Zhejiang-Fujian border front. After being besieged by the five divisions of Zhou Jinyuan, Wang Jinwen, Zhao Guantao, Li Yunhan, and Ruan Zhaochang, Fang Zhimin and Shao Shiping's original bandit lairs, such as Geyuan and Jufang, were completely destroyed. The so-called organs and all equipment were swept away, and the Soviet areas on both sides of the Xin River were blockaded by Jiangxi and Zhejiang, with no way in or out. They could not plunder food from the nearby guerrilla areas, so they had to find another way out. Therefore, the gang recently left Shao Shiping to guard the rear, while Fang Zhimin led the so-called Tenth Army, independent divisions, guard divisions, and others, totaling several thousand people, back into Chong'an, Jianyang, and Guangze from Guangfeng and Qianshan to join Luo Binghui's forces in Taining and Shaowu. According to captured bandits, the two gangs have already colluded. Zhu De and Mao Zedong even sent a wireless radio to Fang Zhimin and Shao Shiping as a tool for military communication. At present, the communist bandit front starts from the Jiangxi-Fujian border, passing through Xunwu, Huichang, Ruijin, Shicheng, Guangchang, Lichuan, and Western Fujian, bordering the above-mentioned counties in Jiangxi, and connecting Shanghang, Wuping, Changting, Ninghua, Jianning, Taining, Shaowu, and Guangze in the north, and extending north to Chong'an, Pucheng, Qianshan, Guangfeng, Shangrao, and Dexing on the border of Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Anhui, forming a long snake. The center of the communist bandit activity is in Jianning, where Zhu De and Mao Zedong are stationed to command. With the changes in the communist bandit situation as described above, the focus of suppressing communists has shifted from the border of Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Fujian to the border of Jiangxi, Fujian, and Zhejiang. According to military sources, Chiang Kai-shek, with the communist threat in Henan, Hubei, and Anhui already cleared, urgently needs to suppress Zhu De, Mao Zedong, Fang Zhimin, and Kong Helong's forces. He has decided to come to Jiangxi to command the campaign in person after ten days. Some of the additional troops he is sending to Jiangxi have already arrived. The supply depots of the three provinces have been established, and Yu Feipeng will come to Jiangxi within days to direct military transportation. These are all preludes to a large-scale campaign. As for the plans and arrangements for suppressing the communists, due to the need for secrecy, details will be omitted for now. According to those who escaped from Xingguo, the communist rear (Southern Jiangxi) is extremely empty. Escapees were inspected by child and female sentries, with no regular Red Army soldiers present. Production in the communist area has ceased, almost like an undeveloped deserted island or an uninhabited barren mountain. All the old and weak will starve to death. The communist bandits regard this as a bloodless and lifeless corpse. Our army can completely recover Southern Jiangxi with just one or two divisions. However, after the recovery, the troops will have no supplies, the people will not be able to defend themselves, and returning refugees will not be able to survive. Post-conflict management and self-defense are a major problem and the most difficult aspect. (November 4)</p>
<h3>The Situation of Bandits in Northern Fujian is Severe</h3>
<p>The Pacification Commissioner's Office is Actively Planning Suppression</p>
<p>Fuzhou dispatch: It is heard that before this communist bandit invasion of Northern Fujian, the bandits convened a meeting in Ruijin and formed a general labor union, electing the bandit leader Lin Biao as the puppet chairman. Fearing encirclement by the large anti-bandit force in Jiangxi and the anti-bandit forces in Guangdong and Fujian, they decided to have the bandit leader Peng Dehuai lead bandits in Huichang to harass Jiangxi, to prevent being attacked from the rear. Meanwhile, bandit leaders Zhu De and Lin Biao led their forces to infiltrate Fujian, planning to join forces with Fang Zhimin and Shao Shiping's gangs in Chong'an and Pucheng, and then split up to infiltrate the Zhejiang border, forming a base on the border of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Fujian. Therefore, after Zhu De and Lin Biao led Luo Binghui and other gangs into Jianning and Taining, they moved horizontally into Shaowu, and then split into two routes from Shaowu. One route, supervised by Zhu De, spied on Jianyang from Masha, so that they could contact Fang Zhimin and Shao Shiping's gangs in Chong'an and Pucheng to enter the Zhejiang border. The other route, supervised by Lin Biao and Luo Binghui, spied on Jiangle from Shaowu, intending to enter Shunchang Yangkou to plunder silver and goods to replenish the army. Yangkou is a major town upstream, where the commercial essence of Yanping, Jianning, Shaowu, and Tingzhou converges, so it is coveted by the bandits. Now, Zhu De's gang arrived at Tabu (50 li from Jianyang) from Masha on October 24. After fierce fighting with the Zhou Brigade and Hu Regiment of the garrison for two hours, Hu retreated to Fengle Town between Jianyang and Jian'ou due to being outnumbered. The bandits then occupied Jianyang City on the 25th. After the bandits entered Jianyang, on the 27th, they sent bandits to spy on Huangyang, and another group of bandits went north to join forces with Fang Zhimin and Shao Shiping's gangs, intending to enter Zhejiang. As for Lin Biao's bandit force, they looted the wealth of merchants and wealthy people in Shaowu, and seized large quantities of grain from various villages. They also sent bandits to spy on Jiangle. On the 28th, according to news from refugees fleeing Yangkou to the province, Jiangle was also occupied by the bandits on the 26th. Therefore, the defense of Shunchang is very strained. Liu's division telegraphed yesterday that defenses have been strengthened in Yangkou, Jian'ou, Nanping, and other places. The suburbs of Yanping are also rushing to build defensive fortifications. All the troops of the division stationed on the south bank of the Min River (Hongshan and above Shuikouwankou area) were transferred to Yanping yesterday to assist in defense. The defenses in various places are quite solid. After the Fuzhou Pacification Commissioner's Office received the telegram from the military authorities in Northern Fujian about the bandit situation, it has been responding with telegrams for days, giving instructions to plan the encirclement and suppression. Yesterday, the office also sent a special commissioner to Yanping and Jianning to inspect the defenses in order to be thorough. Meanwhile, the office ordered the Chen Wei Yuan's Third Provincial Brigade, which had set out for the province, to rush to garrison the Minqing area. If necessary, they would be sent from Minqing to Yanping to assist Liu's division in defense. The brigade arrived in the Da Xiao Ruo area on the 27th. Lin Bingzhou's Second Brigade of the Marine Corps also received orders from the Pacification Commissioner's Office to move from Funing to the Gutian area. The entire First Brigade of the Marine Corps was also transferred to the Changle area. All began to move yesterday. As for the Zhejiang army led by Dai Yue, which came to Fujian to assist in the suppression, it has received a telegram from He Yingqin, ordering them to move to the Fujian border. At present, to prevent the bandits from fleeing north into Zhejiang, they have begun to suppress them on the border of Fujian and Zhejiang. Zhao Guantao's division has also entered Fujian and joined forces with the garrison in Chong'an to encircle and suppress Fang Zhimin's forces, killing more than ten bandits on the spot and capturing more than one hundred rifles, cutting off the bandit's communication lines. From now on, the armies of the three provinces will join forces to suppress the bandits, and it should not be difficult to eliminate them. (October 29)</p>
<p>Another dispatch: Zhu De and Lin Biao led the so-called First and Third Army Corps from Eastern Jiangxi to invade Northern Fujian, successively capturing Jianning, Taining, Shaowu, and Guangze, and threatening Jiangle and Jianyang. The situation upstream is suddenly tense. Liu Heding, commander of the Fifty-sixth Division, has decided to defend Jian'ou and Shunchang with all his strength to secure Yanping. The front line of Jian'ou is in Fengle Village, at the junction of Jian'ou and Jianyang, defended by Zhou Zhimin's brigade. However, Zhou's troops suffered considerable losses in the battles of Taining and Shaowu and are awaiting replenishment. Therefore, one regiment of Ma Hongxing's troops has been added to assist them. The front line of Shunchang is in Gaotan Town, at the junction of Shunchang and Jiangle, defended by Gui Zhenyuan's brigade. Liu Heding himself went to the front in Jian'ou from Yanping a few days ago to supervise the troops and engaged in a fierce battle with the bandits in Huangyang, forcing Lin Biao's forces to retreat. The bandit forces have retreated slightly. The bandit's original plan was to have Lin Biao stationed in Taining, directing the attack on Jianyang and Jiangle, while Zhu De was stationed in Jianning, directing the attack on Guihua and Qingliu, with two routes advancing simultaneously, attempting to contain the National Revolutionary Army's advance. Now, because the National Revolutionary Army's Wang Jinwen and Mao Hongwen's divisions in Jiangxi province are advancing on Qianshan and Lichuan, approaching the Fujian border, Lin Biao, Zhu De, and other bandits fear that their rear will be cut off, and Zhu De has urgently led the so-called First Army Corps back to Guangchang and Shicheng on the Jiangxi border from Jianning and Ninghua, intending to resist. Therefore, the newly formed First Division under Lu Xingbang, stationed in Yong'an and Shaxian, immediately sent troops to take over the defense of Guihua and Qingliu. Lin Biao's forces in Taining and Shaowu were greatly affected and dared not advance further. Liu Heding telegraphed yesterday, stating that the defense of the entire line has been completed, and once the Jiangxi army enters Fujian, a large-scale counterattack can be launched to achieve a pincer attack. However, most of the refugees from Jianning, Taining, Shaowu, Guangze, and Jiangle are still gathered in Yanping Yangkou, and a small number are taking boats to the province, staying in the guild halls of their respective counties. Yesterday, the Northern Fujian Hometown Relief Association petitioned the Pacification Commissioner's Office and the Provincial Government, requesting that shelters be set up in Yangkou, Yanping, and Fuzhou to accommodate them and allocate funds for relief to avoid displacement.

<h3>Lin Yizhong Reports on His Trip to Siam</h3>
<p>Guangzhou dispatch: Lin Yizhong, Director of the Civil Affairs Department of Guangdong Province, departed from Hong Kong for Siam on September 19 with Xiao Focheng to congratulate the Siamese People's Party on its success. They arrived in Bangkok on the 28th. Xiao Focheng had made prior arrangements, so all entry inspection procedures were waived. After arriving in Siam, they paid visits to the President of the Senate, Yemanu, the leader of the People's Party, Cheng Paliet, the Commander-in-Chief of the National Army, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and others. They also visited Bangkok's police agencies, prisons, palaces, hospitals, schools, and Buddhist temples. After the visit, they left Siam for Singapore on the 12th of last month and returned to Guangdong by boat. However, Xiao Focheng remained in Siam, with no news of his return. On the 31st, Lin reported on his inspection of Siam during the memorial week of the Southwest Executive Department's Political Affairs Committee. Excerpts are recorded as follows: Since the revolution in Siam, the royal family only has the power to issue decrees, and state affairs are decided by the Senate. The senior administrative agencies include the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Justice, the General Staff, and the National Army Headquarters. The country is divided into nine provinces and one capital city. Provinces have governors, and cities have mayors and a police commissioner, all under the Ministry of Interior. Provinces are divided into prefectures, prefectures are divided into counties, and counties are divided into townships, with ten households per village, ten villages per township, and ten or more townships per county. The administration and police of the capital city are separate, each with its own department. Provincial police administration is under administrative control. The military system adopts conscription, and men are required to serve three years of military service upon reaching the age of eighteen. Public security is the responsibility of the police, and the National Army is responsible for national defense. There are about 2 million overseas Chinese in Siam, most of whom are engaged in business. Among the overseas Chinese, the largest number are from Chaozhou and Guangzhou, followed by people from Hainan and Fujian. People from Guangzhou are in the minority. The largest overseas Chinese business is the rice industry, followed by lumber mills. The rest are coolies, farmers, or land reclaimers. China and Siam do not have a treaty, and although overseas Chinese in Siam do not have consular protection, they are not treated harshly because of similarities in skin color and race. Overseas Chinese only need to pay an entry tax of 40 yuan per person to enter Siam. Overseas Chinese in Siam can freely operate businesses and buy and sell land, but gatherings and associations for political patriotic activities are strictly prohibited. Twenty years ago, Siam had no overseas Chinese schools, and overseas Chinese children mostly attended Siamese schools, where they were assimilated and had weak patriotic ideas. After the establishment of overseas Chinese schools, the children of overseas Chinese were able to recognize Chinese characters and learn about the concept of the motherland. Currently, there are only 12 overseas Chinese primary schools in Bangkok, so many overseas Chinese are still illiterate. Overseas Chinese are all in the industrial and commercial sectors and do not have a clear understanding of the politics of their motherland, relying only on local Chinese newspapers for information. Although there are four Chinese newspaper offices in the area, they each have their own backgrounds and it is difficult to get accurate news from China. However, although overseas Chinese sometimes misunderstand the politics of their motherland, their concern remains strong. During the Shanghai Incident, they donated 5-600,000 yuan to support the anti-Japanese national salvation effort. Their only hope is that their motherland will no longer have civil wars and will concentrate the nation's strength to resist foreign aggression. (November 1)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province Establishes Publication Review Committee</h3>
<p>Jointly organized by party and government agencies</p>
<p>Regulations on Review of Publications Have Been Promulgated</p>

<h3>Profound Dissertation after the Investigation of Northeastern China by Westerners (Continued)</h3>
<p>2.  Harbin and Changchun Area: Due to this year's floods and the activities of the Volunteer Army, the supply of food is extremely difficult. The eastern and western sections of the Chinese Eastern Railway cannot be used for transportation because the two sections of the railway are almost completely under the control of the Volunteer Army. Therefore, the value of various foods is extremely high, and postal communication is often interrupted. For example, letters from Shenyang to Harbin sometimes take ten days. Yagi, the Japanese advisor in the Harbin Police Department, has reorganized the police personnel in Harbin, but the result has only allowed the opportunity for riots in the port to expand. The newly appointed police do not restrict rioters, so the citizens of the entire port are in a state of panic. The Soviet employees of the Chinese Eastern Railway were previously slacking off, but now they are working completely according to Japanese wishes. In Changchun City (Yamatodaei), important streets have evicted local residents from their residences because the puppet government needs 700 houses for the residence of puppet government officials. Since August, construction work has been expanded in Changchun and Kuanchengzi, and workers have been ordered to work day and night. There is also a feeling of a lack of stone needed for construction. In Harbin, Changchun, Shenyang, etc., people who work against the puppet government are often arrested, but this has not improved the situation. In Shenyang, four suspects were arrested for plotting to harm Saitō (October 6), one of whom was a White Russian immigrant, Aniseff. Leaflets in Chinese denouncing the puppet government and expelling the Japanese are often found in the above-mentioned areas.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education of the Manchukuo puppet government has been in arrears with the salaries of teachers in various schools since the beginning of this year. The teachers' salaries for January were paid in three installments: 20% was paid in February, 30% in March, and 50% in April. The salaries for February were paid in two installments: 50% was paid in May and 50% in June. The salaries for March were only paid 50% at the end of July, and it was announced that the remaining 50% would be suspended. After that, 50% of the teachers' salaries for April were paid in August. According to information received, all personnel in the Ministry of Education of Manchukuo are actively carrying out anti-Japanese and anti-Manchu work, providing assistance to the Chinese Volunteer Army. The teachers in various schools are also voluntarily donating part of their salaries to the anti-Japanese movement and carrying out extensive anti-Japanese propaganda among the students in the schools. This kind of action is supported by teachers. In short, all civil servants in the Manchukuo puppet government are expanding their anti-Japanese and anti-Manchu thoughts. They consider their duties in the "New Country" to be like being in a period of captivity. The Japanese advisors in "Manchukuo" have already been aware of this will of the civil servants, but there is no way to improve the situation, because there are very few people who cooperate with Japan, and in order to fill the number of positions in the puppet government, it is necessary to use people with anti-Japanese thoughts. The Japanese poor who have lived in Manchuria for a long time all deny that their position in Manchuria can be consolidated. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Important News Two</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang Port Plan</h3>
<p>Due to changes in the canal transport route, the opening of the Jinpu Railway, and the increasing siltation of sandbars in the river, Zhenjiang's commerce and industry have been declining. After the provincial government moved to Zhenjiang, the authorities, in order to develop industry and commerce and promote the prosperity of the port, proposed building a new port at Xiangshan. The Construction Department is now actively working to make it a reality. It is heard that the latest plan is to make river management the foundation for building a new port. If the river does not follow the right course, it is difficult to guarantee that the newly built port will not repeat past mistakes. In order to get to the root of the problem, it is planned to start by correcting the waterways upstream and downstream of Zhenjiang. The north and south waterways of Shiyezhou and the Zhengrunzhou waterway must be improved first, and the surface of the island must be raised. The Liuyu area on the north bank will be subject to bank protection and construction projects. Then, Zhengrunzhou, with an area of 15,000 mu, will be converted into a commercial port. The construction plan for the Xiangshan New Port is divided into public wharf and commercial area. The wharf will have four lighters to accommodate river ships. There is a canal located south of the warehouses, 920 meters long, for small boats and sailboats to dock. There is a boat pond located in the eastern part of the area, 400 meters long, connected to the canal and the Yangtze River, for civilian boats to dock temporarily in case of wind and also for repairing boats and sailboats. There are spacious warehouses to meet the needs of cargo storage. The commercial area is located west of the boat pond and south of the canal, with a total area of more than 12,000 acres together with the public wharf area. It is connected to the city and West Gate Street by three trunk lines. The railway is particularly important. It is planned to build a branch line from the Zhenjiang South Gate Station of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, crossing the canal and reaching the wharf directly, so that the waterway and railway can be connected, making the transportation of goods and the traffic of merchants more convenient. In addition, the roads will be paved with crushed stone, with widths divided into five grades, the widest being 24 meters and the narrowest being 10 meters, divided into three major trunk lines, so that the new and old urban areas can be connected everywhere.</p>

<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>The Embezzlement of the Accountant of the Charity Hall is Exposed</p>
<p>Tongren Nursery and Yuying Hall in Xinmiaoqian, in the city</p>
<p>The Tongren Nursery and Yuying Hall, established by the Qin and Hua families, have a long history. The Tongren Hall has more than a thousand acres of farmland, and the collected rent is allocated for charity purposes. Hua Zhongyuan, the accountant of the two halls, has been in charge since he took office in the 16th year of the Republic of China, monopolizing power and keeping the accounts secret and not making them public. Recently, the board of directors found that Hua Zhongyuan had inflated expenses and embezzled a total of 15,000 yuan. Therefore, the board of directors immediately issued a notice to suspend his duties, and the accounting affairs were temporarily handled by Ding Ruichu, while the accounts were being cleared. Since his suspension, Hua has been hiding in his residence at No. 1 Jinshifang Lane nearby and could not be found. Hua has instead sent a letter to a director of the board of directors, repeatedly asking Hua to seek three conditions. First, the embezzlement part will not be investigated in depth. Second, the receipts have been lost and will not be reissued. Third, the accounts can only be secretly viewed by certain two people and must not be announced to the outside world. After receiving the letter, the association submitted a request to the county court yesterday, requesting an order to bring Hua Zhongyuan to court to pursue the recovery of the embezzled funds, and a joint submission from a public group and people from all walks of life to the competent authority, requesting that Hua Zhongyuan be punished as he deserves and ordered to hand over the embezzled funds in full within a limited time.</p>
<h3>Planned Widening of Sanxia Tang Street</h3>
<p>Widening of Sanxia Tang Street</p>
<p>The case of widening Sanxia Tang Street has been repeatedly handled by the former Construction Bureau Director Yao Dixin, who sent personnel to measure and draw diagrams. Ultimately, due to the opposition of a few local residents, the project was delayed and not implemented. After Director Xiao of the Construction Bureau took office, he convened relevant representatives for a meeting and followed the Construction Department's approval to set the street standard at eight meters. This includes six meters for the carriageway, one meter on each side for sidewalks, and engineering works for road surfaces, ditches, and bridges, which are currently under design. However, the construction funding is currently unavailable, which is deeply concerning. Director Xiao will submit a detailed report on the fundraising situation to the Construction Department, along with a complete plan of Sanxia Tang Street, requesting instructions. Director Dong, after reviewing the report, stated that the primary questions are whether the street is a direct north-south thoroughfare, whether there is a need to gradually reduce the width, and whether the required construction funds can be raised. Yesterday, he specifically ordered Magistrate Chen to supervise Director Xiao of the Construction Bureau to devise a proper plan and submit it to a meeting for discussion and approval. After receiving the order, Magistrate Chen immediately instructed Director Xiao of the Construction Bureau to comply.</p>

<p>The Truth Comes Out in the Rural Teachers' Slogan Case</p>
<p>The Sixth District Security Corps arrested students for posting reactionary slogans by students from the Provincial Huangdu Rural Normal School. Initially, opinions varied.

<p>Letter to the Editor</p>
<h3>Letter from Jiang Yannong of Taicang</h3>
<p>To the esteemed editor of Shen Bao:</p>
<p>I am writing to you today because I read in the Taicang News section of your newspaper's second local communication page on November 1st of this year, that the opium public sale is about to be implemented, involving my contract. I was very shocked to read this. I have always stayed at home and never heard of any local affairs, and opium poisoning, all of our Chinese people, are deeply hated. Recently, newspapers have repeatedly reported that the government has repeatedly stated that there is no such public sale policy. Where can I contract? It is clear that this news is entirely a catch-all and purely fictitious. I am writing to you specifically to correct this and to avoid confusion. I hope you will do so. Sincerely, Jiang Yannong.</p>

<h3>Hard Court Tennis Tournament Momentum Gradually Intensifying</h3>
<p>Lin Baohua, Jiang Daozhang, and Zheng Zhaojia All Won Yesterday</p>
<p>Yu Tianguang and Liang Deguang Singles Semifinals Today</p>
<p>In the French Chamber of Commerce's hard court tennis tournament, the Chinese participants include Lin Baohua and Medmore in mixed doubles, Jiang Daozhang and Zheng Zhaojia in men's doubles, and Yu Tianguang, Sun Linfang, and Liang Deguang in men's singles (Jiang also originally participated, but later withdrew). Lin, Jiang, and Zheng all had matches yesterday, and all were victorious. Today at 2:30 PM, the men's singles semifinal between Yu Tianguang and Liang Deguang is well worth watching. Here is a record of the situation in each category:</p>
<h3>Men's Doubles Tournament</h3>
<p>There are eight pairs in this event. Yesterday, Jiang Daozhang and Zheng Zhaojia defeated their opponents, Gormet and Plante, with superb skills, with a score of 6-2, 6-1. They will soon play Smith and Squire in the finals. At the same time yesterday, Canavan and Lothar initially won against the Hu brothers with two sets of 6-2, but were then defeated by Balanchi and Meihams with a score of 7-9, 6-3, 3-6. Comparing the strengths of all parties, Jiang and Zheng can steadily win the championship.</p>
<h3>Men's Singles Tournament</h3>
<p>There are twelve participants, including Jiang Daozhang. Later, in order to encourage novices, he forfeited the opening match to Sun Linfang. Sun is also one of the hopefuls. The others, such as Yu Tianguang and Liang Deguang, are all preparing to move forward. This afternoon at 2:30 PM, the two will hold the semifinals. On the other hand, Sun Linfang and Balanchi will face off in the semifinal line. If Sun wins another day, it will become a situation where our Chinese are competing for the top spot.</p>
<h3>Mixed Doubles Tournament</h3>
<p>There are six pairs participating in this event. Yesterday was the first day of the competition. Lin Baohua and Medmore defeated Mrs. Luo and Leng Shilinjie with a score of 6-0, 6-2. Today, Canavan and Miss Kolasha will play. In the future, the finals will probably be between the above two teams, with the latter having a greater chance. The other four pairs are slightly weaker and will inevitably fail midway.</p>
<h3>Navy's Strength Suddenly Increases; Donghua Barely Wins</h3>
<p>Result: 3 to 0</p>
<p>No Achievements in the First Half</p>
<p>In the Western League Football Association, the strength of the British Navy is unpredictable. Those who were mediocre and incompetent yesterday may transform into a strong and powerful team today. This is because the troops are transferred from time to time, and the strength of the team also changes from time to time. This has been clearly proven in previous years. Even the Navy this year was incompetent, having lost to Jinan 0-11. However, the Navy that played against Donghua at the baseball field yesterday was a strong and powerful team. It was a combined team of Conto and Kaituo, who had recently come to Shanghai. The Conto fleet defeated the Lehua in its heyday with a score of 2-1. Although its strength has slightly decreased, it is still a strong team. Therefore, neither side scored in the first half of yesterday's match. In the second half, Donghua spared no effort to score three consecutive goals and win the final victory. Generally, football fans thought that yesterday's match would be uninteresting, and only a few thousand people came to the scene. However, those who witnessed the battle were all amazed. Here is a record of the fierce battle:</p>
<p>Chen Hongguang Misses Three Times</p>
<p>With the sound of the horn, the three armies</p>
<p>lined up. Donghua was in the south, with the wind helping, and launched a major attack on the north. Li Yichen broke through the encirclement, with Chen Wanliang on both sides. Henry could not stop them and asked Du Foyer for help, and the ball was cleared out of danger. Feng Yunyou was loyal and courageous, and his passing was appropriate. Wan Xianghua crossed the ball, and Chen Hongguang used his head to attack, but unfortunately it went over the crossbar and became a wild ball. Long Lei did not kick the ball far, and Wu Youliang intercepted it midway and passed it to Yu Tian. Henry and two enemy generals rushed out of the kickoff line, and the inside was empty. Yichen and Xiaowan marched quickly to the shooting area and threw the ball to Hongguang, who headed the ball again, but it became a wild ball. In less than two minutes, Chen Hongguang rushed into the enemy's territory alone. Feng Yunyou got the ball and shot at the gate from afar. Hongguang caught up and accelerated, but the ball passed by the gate three times without entering.</p>
<p>Li Yiju First Captures Enemy City</p>
<p>The British army struggled in the stormy waves</p>
<p>for more than ten minutes and was fortunate not to fall into the trap. They then launched a major counterattack and attacked our position several times. Li Ning worked hard, and Guan Xun'an did not give way, preventing the enemy from entering our territory. After the break, the British army took advantage of the favorable wind and their attack became brave and sharp, often entering our area. However, because the forward did not have agile feet, they repeatedly failed to succeed. After a fierce battle for fifteen minutes, Tu Kaiyuan shouted and mobilized the troops, and Feng Yunyou provided support from behind. Chen Jiaqiu dribbled the ball past Henry and passed it far to Xiaowan. Du Foyer stepped forward, but the ball had already been crossed. Li Yichen headed the ball into the goal on the Long Lei line, and the score was opened.</p>
<p>Wan Xianghua Makes Another Miraculous Contribution</p>
<p>Although the enemy lost a city,</p>
<p>their momentum became more arrogant. Qu Lu and Ge Liying were especially brave, attacking the iron gate five or six times, but all failed. Before long, Li Ning kicked a ball out of the inner guard line, and Tu Kaiyuan quickly passed it to Hongguang. After three passes, the ball was obtained by Wan Xianghua, who was as fast as a galloping horse. Taifo tried his best to entangle him but could not. Sankai also lost ground one after another. Xiaowan entered the no-man's land and hurriedly raised his foot to knock on the door. Long Lei could not stop him, and the ball entered the goal from the upper left corner, clear and sharp, which was very wonderful.</p>
<p>Fulan Mu Misunderstands and Misses an Opportunity</p>
<p>After Donghua scored two goals,</p>
<p>they were radiant and handy, and invincible. Although Henry was brave, he was old and weak. He could still cope with the first half without any errors, but in the second half, he was embarrassed. In addition, with two cities lost, the soldiers had no will to fight, and the inner guard line was especially chaotic. Before long, Chen Yutian went deep alone and passed the ball to Jiaqiu at a suitable spot. For some reason, Fulan Mu was stunned and did not save the ball. Li Yichen scored another goal. The ball bounced off Fulan Mu's back and entered the goal. The goalkeeper fell to the ground to save it, but it was too late. Before the battle was over, the war clouds were gloomy and the sound of the horn rose. Donghua sang another triumphant song.</p>

<h3>Middle School Tennis Championship: Fudan Shizhong Wins</h3>
<p>Defeats Hujiang 2-0</p>
<p>The 4th Shanghai Middle School Tennis League has been underway for several days since the start of the championship. The winners of the final were Hujiang Affiliated Middle School and Fudan Shizhong. The two schools held the final at the China Tennis Court at 3 PM yesterday. Both sides had young players and new talents, so the battle was quite exciting. After a fierce battle of more than an hour, Fudan Shizhong won both singles matches and defeated Hujiang 2-0, winning the championship. Hujiang, which had held the championship for three years, was shaken today, and the brilliant championship trophy was moved from Yangshupu to Jiangwan Road, which is a new change in the history of middle school tennis. After the match, Ms. Zhao Shaonan was invited to present the awards. Here are the results of the two singles matches and the overall match results:</p>
<p>(1) Liang Deguang (Fudan Shizhong) 6-1, 6-0 Wu Guoxiang (Hujiang)</p>
<p>(2) Ma Canzhou (Fudan Shizhong) 6-0, 6-0 Tang Zhihuai (Hujiang)</p>

<h3>Five Years of Memories</h3>
<p>In terms of the team... Hujiang is the best</p>
<p>Talking about individuals... talents emerge in large numbers</p>
<p>The Shanghai Middle School Sports Association was established in the winter of the 16th year of the Republic of China (1927) and has a history of five years. It has held four tennis leagues, and with the advocacy and encouragement of various schools, it has cultivated many young tennis talents, who are active in the tennis world. For example, Yu Tianguang and He Shengting were small heroes who won the championship for Hujiang in those years. Over the years, Mr. Yu has leapt to become one of the top figures in Shanghai. In addition, Qian Yaobin of Guanghua once fought to the death with Yu Tianguang many times in middle school. Mr. Qian's skills are also one of the best in Shanghai today. Others, such as Deng You of Guanghua and Xie Quanhe of Jinan, all came from here and are now the main players in the university tennis competition. Since the opening of this year's league, another comet has been discovered, namely Liang Deguang of Fudan Shizhong, who is young and highly skilled and is appreciated by general connoisseurs. Even the veteran Wang Qulin has praised him as a rising star with great potential. In terms of the team, Hujiang has won the championship for three consecutive years. In terms of individuals, talents have emerged from all sides. At the end of the tennis competition, I have written this in a haphazard manner to commemorate the event. (Qian)</p>
<h3>All Countries Are Secretly Striving for the International Race Walking</h3>
<p>To Be Held on December 4th</p>
<p>Cheng Yize Donates Prizes</p>
<p>The International Race Walking, which is actively underway, will be held on Sunday, December 4th. The route will be the same as in previous years, with the finish line still in front of the grandstand of the Racecourse. This competition has attracted attention early on. Athletes from all countries are secretly striving hard. Chinese talents are emerging in large numbers and are doing their best to maintain their previous glory. Britain has ten people in training, including many outstanding people. There are six people in the French training camp, one of whom has recently achieved excellent times. There is currently no news from Ireland, but if their captain, Fenton, directs appropriately, the team's results should also be considerable. Russia is still making a lot of noise. The most surprising thing is that Italy also has eight people in hard training. It is also heard that Japan will also participate in the competition. This year, many parties have donated prizes. Mr. Cheng Yize, who is enthusiastic about sports, will continue to provide his support.</p>
<h3>John's Affiliated Middle School Wins Charity Basketball Group B Championship</h3>
<p>Women's Championship Belongs to Southeast Women's Physical Education</p>
<p>The charity basketball tournament, which had no clear beginning or end, was fortunately concluded last night. The Group B championship belonged to John's Affiliated Middle School, and the women's championship was won by Southeast Women's Physical Education School. This competition has exposed the shortcomings of Shanghai sports enthusiasts and athletes that have not been vented for many years, and has reignited the ashes, which cannot but be a pity. The negligence of those in charge is the reason for creating this bad situation. It cannot be completely blamed on the team. Now that the competition is finally over, the handling of the ticket proceeds will depend on the good deeds of the so-called (Economic Committee). Here is the record of last night's match:</p>
<h3>John's Wins Group B Championship</h3>
<p>In the Group B championship final, John's Affiliated Middle School played against Jiangnan, with clear and rapid performances. John's had pure coordination and accurate shooting. Jiangnan was also accomplished, but scored few points due to inaccurate shooting. As a result, John's won 28-8 and won the championship. In the first half, John's scored 15 points and Jiangnan only scored 2 points. The referee was Lu Xiangqian.</p>

<h3>Southeast Wins Women's Championship</h3>
<p>The two teams that won the right to the women's group final were Dongnan and Jiangnan. The championship was held at 7 PM last night. As a result, Dongnan won by a large margin of 47-6 and won the championship. Jiangnan only scored two points in the first quarter by You Fusheng, and then Feng Wanbi scored four points until the fourth quarter. The Dongnan forwards were quite brave, but they had the disadvantage of being selfish and unwilling to pass. Miss Pan Yueying scored 29 points alone, which was not easy. The guards were also commendable. Feng Wanbi was more outstanding in Jiangnan. The results are as follows: Referee Zhou Jiaqi</p>

<h3>Municipal Government Telegraphs the Executive Yuan to Stop Extending Loans for American Wheat</h3>
<p>Grain Prices Plunge, Efforts Underway to Provide Relief</p>
<p>Dumping of American Wheat Severely Damages the Economy</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government yesterday telegraphed the Executive Yuan on behalf of the Nanjing Executive Yuan: "Respectfully, according to a report from the Bureau of Social Affairs, concerning a petition. Based on a report from the Grain Committee, also concerning a petition. At the 37th regular meeting of the Committee, a temporary motion was made regarding the disastrous fall in grain prices, requesting that the Central Government refrain from further borrowing American wheat to avoid harming the agricultural economy. The motion resolved to present a report requesting a halt to the reported plan of the Central Government to borrow American wheat, etc. An investigation reveals that, according to various newspapers, the matter involves discussions between a US advisor to the Ministry of Finance and the Shanghai representative of the US Finance Corporation for Rehabilitation regarding the amount of the extended loan and the methods of transportation to China. The total amount of the extended loan is approximately 450,000 tons, valued at US$12 million, equivalent to CN¥50 million. If this is true, the impact on the domestic rural economy will be significant. Moreover, this year's harvest in various regions is relatively abundant, and grain prices have plummeted. The Central Government is striving to implement relief measures. If a large amount of American wheat is transported to China for sale, domestic grain prices will inevitably fall further, reaching a point beyond recovery. The rural economy will be on the verge of irreversible destruction, and the farmers, who account for 80% of the national population, will face bankruptcy. The Committee feels deeply concerned and cannot remain silent. Therefore, we respectfully submit the resolved motion to Your Excellency, requesting your prompt review and a telegraph to the Central Government to halt the proposed extension of the American wheat loan, etc. Accordingly, an investigation of the minutes of the 37th meeting of the Committee shows that the report has already been submitted for review and filing. Based on the report, in addition to instructions, we respectfully submit a report for your review, which is deemed to be in the public interest, etc. Accordingly, an investigation reveals that this year's harvest in various regions is relatively abundant, and grain prices have plummeted. Efforts are currently underway to provide relief, which is already a challenge. If, as reported, American wheat is further loaned, transported to China, and dumped, domestic grain prices will inevitably fall further, significantly impacting the domestic agricultural economy. Therefore, careful consideration is essential. Based on the report, in addition to instructions, we respectfully submit a telegraph for your review and guidance. Wu Tiecheng, Mayor of Shanghai, bowing, seal."</p>
<h3>Li Du Telegraphs War Situation</h3>
<p>Self-Defense Army Occupies Fujin</p>
<p>Liu Piguang, the Shanghai representative of General Li Du, received a telegram yesterday from Li regarding the war situation at the front. The translated original telegram recorded by the Riri (Daily News) is as follows: (Omitted above) 1. Li Xiaotong, the commander-in-chief of the Yilan region, led the Lu Yongcai and Chen Zongdai brigades to inflict a major defeat on the enemy forces at the Battle of Tulong Mountain. The small detachment stationed in Fujin showed signs of activity, fearing that our troops would pursue and advance on Jiamusi and Yilan, etc., to create a remote diversion. The Wang Ruishu regiment of our Lu Yongcai brigade, on October 21st, circled behind the enemy forces in Fujin, launching a fierce surprise attack. The enemy forces responded with full force, engaging in fierce combat for four days and nights. The enemy forces were unable to withstand the attack and retreated along the river. On the dawn of October 26th, Fujin was occupied by our troops. In this battle, 38 enemy soldiers were killed, and an uncalculated number were wounded. We also captured one heavy machine gun and several dozen rifles. Our side also suffered casualties. After a brief period of reorganization, we plan to join forces with our troops currently moving along the river to advance on Jiamusi, Yilan, etc. 2. The Songhua River area has been severely disturbed by enemy and puppet troops. Compounding this, the recent floods have made life unbearable for our people. The Japanese army has recently used large sums of money to bribe puppet officials and unscrupulous merchants to purchase large quantities of grain at high prices from various locations along the river, transporting it to Harbin and then transferring it elsewhere. After suffering from war and disaster, agricultural production in various areas along the river is only one or two out of ten. Farmers, due to livelihood concerns, have no choice but to sell as much as possible. Under these circumstances, even without war or natural disasters next year, the seeds for the people will become a problem. Our troops face increasing difficulties. This policy of the Japanese army can be described as extremely vicious. 3. From the beginning of the invasion of Northeast China, the Japanese army has actively implemented armed immigration, but immigration is only a name, and the reality is the concealment of troops. According to our recent investigations, Japanese immigrants in the Jiamusi area are freely occupying our people's land or expelling our good people from the country under the pretext of reactionary or other crimes, and then transferring their land to Japanese immigrants. After obtaining large amounts of land, these Japanese immigrants either hire Korean laborers to cultivate the land or force our people to work. They are completely engaged in military affairs. This situation is clearly a disguised form of troop increase and armed robbery, but they call it immigration, which is too much of a self-deception. (Omitted below)</p>
<h3>Li Du and Ding Chao's Representative, Su Chun, Makes a Statement</h3>
<p>Li's Directly Controlled National Defense Army Totals 50,000 Men</p>
<p>Tenaciously Defending Twelve Counties, Fighting a Desperate Battle Against the Enemy</p>
<p>Generals Li Du and Ding Chao recently sent a representative, Su Chun, south to report to the Central Government on the anti-Japanese situation of the Jilin Self-Defense Army. He arrived in Shanghai yesterday from Beijing and immediately reported to various circles in the city and various mass organizations to express gratitude for their assistance and to discuss all matters. The Riri (Daily News) reporter met with Mr. Su yesterday, and he provided a detailed account of the situation in Jilin. The following is a record: The Northeast Incident has passed for over a year. In Jilin, Generals Li and Ding rose up to resist the Japanese, and the righteous armies responded. The Japanese invaders were exhausted from running around. They only guarded the railway lines and important cities, relying on their sophisticated equipment and powerful firepower to simultaneously attack and defend, waiting for us to be trapped and put to death. If we do not receive sufficient assistance, it will be difficult to maintain a long-term and unwearying resistance against the enemy. On behalf of Generals Li and Ding, I disguised myself and came south to report the recent situation of the Jilin army to all circles in Shanghai, representing all the soldiers and expressing our sincere gratitude for the enthusiasm of the Shanghai circles in their past assistance. We also request continued supplies to strengthen our forces, so that we can fight a desperate battle against the bandits. Deputy Commander Li is currently stationed in Muleng Lishuzhen, commanding military operations at the front. Chairman Ding is stationed in Boli, touring various counties and managing the entire administration. As for all the troops within the scope of the Self-Defense Army, excluding the units led by Feng Zhanhai and others who are operating as guerrillas in various locations, Li's directly controlled units consist of nine fully equipped mixed brigades of the National Defense Army, totaling approximately 50,000 men, distributed in various locations at the front. In addition, 20 security regiments, totaling approximately 30,000 men, are organized in various counties in the rear. They are all equipped with weapons, but ammunition is lacking. In the twelve counties defended by Ding and Li, the area is over 3,000 li in circumference. Within this area, the Blue Sky with a White Sun national flag is displayed everywhere, the people continue to work as usual, schools are still open, and postal communications are unimpeded. Li has also specially dispatched a cavalry regiment to patrol and suppress bandits, so the local security is very good. Chickens and dogs are not alarmed. This is truly the only intact area in the Northeast. However, due to the inconvenience of foreign trade, there is a great lack of materials. Li has a strong force, and his subordinates are strictly disciplined. Cooperation between officials and the people is very harmonious. If the government and the compatriots throughout the country can provide them with sufficient assistance, they will be able to resist the enemy for a long time. The weather in the Northeast is quite cold, and it is now covered with ice and snow. If the Songhua River freezes solid, the Japanese fleet will become ineffective, and we will be able to break through the enemy in Yilan. At the same time, we have a liaison plan with Chairman Ma and Commander Su. When the two sides meet, Jilin and Heilongjiang can be united into one, and the recovery of northern Manchuria is truly a matter of time. Currently, Li Xiaotong, the deputy chief of staff of the headquarters, is serving as the commander-in-chief of the Yilan area and has crossed Fujin and Huachuan, approaching Yilan. The enemy and insurgents in Yilan will soon be wiped out. In the past, the Japanese army built a very strong motor road from Dunhua to Ning'an, originally intending to use this road to utilize tanks and armored vehicles, but it has now been seized by the forces of Ma Xianzhang, the commander-in-chief of the road, and Liu Wankui, the deputy commander. The Japanese troops stationed in various locations in Jilin only dare to operate along the railway and dare not leave the vicinity. Currently, with the exception of a few cities that are fiercely occupied by the Japanese army, the remaining towns and cities are all within the sphere of influence of the Self-Defense Army. Even the few bandits scattered in various counties in western Jilin have anti-Japanese hearts and cooperate with the government troops. That bandits can do this is also very admirable. As for the Big Sword Society, they are all organized by the brave people, and the tens of thousands of troops trained by Xing Zhanqing and Yang Yaojun are especially elite. Li plans to expand the organization and training, so that every citizen of Jilin will be a staunch anti-Japanese element, so as to resist the Japanese for a long time without fatigue. Currently, there is a small-scale ordnance factory in the rear of our army, manufacturing landmines, hand grenades, bombs, etc. As for the bullets used for rifles, because there is no copper shell machine, we can only collect discarded bullet shells and carry out the procedure of loading medicine by hand, so the results are not as good as the manufacture of hand grenades, etc. Wherever I passed, the soldiers were stationed in trenches or underground tunnels, suffering greatly, but without complaint. These are soldiers fighting for the survival of the nation, which is truly admirable and fills me with infinite emotion. I previously went to various places in the Northeast to investigate and felt that within the scope of Li and Ding, military and government affairs were in order, and the people did not feel pain, so they also joined the work. I was quite moved by the sincerity of Generals Li and Ding towards their subordinates, and the subordinates all obeyed orders and did their duty. Therefore, the Japanese army's forces have not been able to reach the twelve counties in eastern Jilin. On September 20th, I was ordered to enter the pass to report, but because I walked over 1,600 li, the arrival was relatively late. I have previously held military and political positions in various places in Jiangsu and Anhui. This year, in February, I was indignant at the Japanese pirates' endless aggression and had a responsibility to save the country, so I asked for leave to go out of the pass and join the Self-Defense Army, hoping to do my best.</p>
<h3>Temporary Martial Law Tomorrow</h3>
<p>November 7th is the 15th anniversary of the establishment of the Soviet government in Russia. Wen Hongsi, the director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, received reports beforehand that the Communist Party in the city would take action. In order to strictly prevent this, he ordered the police stations in each district, the police brigade, and the detective units to strengthen precautions in advance. At that time, all units would be dispatched, and temporary martial law would be declared. He also discussed joint defense measures with the police departments of the Public Concession and the French Concession. At that time, temporary martial law would be declared throughout the city, and meetings and parades would be prohibited.</p>
<h3>Over 100 Public Associations in the City Request Punishment of Customs Officials</h3>
<p>Over one hundred trade associations in the city believe that the Jianghai Customs has exceeded its authority and harassed businesses. They previously sent representatives to Beijing to petition, which was reported in various newspapers. It has now been heard that the various trade associations believe that Robert Ford, the Customs Commissioner, and George Wright, the Deputy Customs Commissioner, of the Maritime Customs, have used their own personal intentions to exceed their authority and harass businesses. Tang Haian, the Superintendent of Huai Customs, has sat idly by while businesses were harassed and has failed to correct the situation, neglecting his duties. At a meeting of the chairmen of the various trade associations a few days ago, it was resolved to jointly file a complaint with the National Government's Executive Yuan, Control Yuan, and Ministry of Finance, requesting that Customs Commissioner Robert Ford, Deputy Customs Commissioner George Wright, and Customs Superintendent Tang Haian be dismissed from their posts and handed over for disciplinary action to appease public anger. The original petition states: "We, the undersigned, petition concerning the matter of Jianghai Customs searching for smuggled goods and tax evasion, which has recently exceeded its scope and intruded into shops, causing widespread harassment. Representatives from various industries have been jointly dispatched to the relevant departments in the capital to petition on this matter. Although there are no complete tariff laws and regulations to study the scope of the Customs' authority to search for tax evasion, a rough outline can be obtained by examining various sources. For the purpose of suppressing smuggling, the Customs has specially established several patrol boats for the use of Customs police. This demonstrates that the execution of duties is limited to the Customs ports under its jurisdiction. This is sufficient proof. Among the national agencies that handle tax collection and are similar to the Customs, there were formerly Likin stations and regular customs, and now there are Unified Tax Bureaus in various districts. Likin stations and regular customs only inspected ships or merchants, not shops. Unified Tax Bureaus only inspect goods leaving factories and not retailers. This is because their powers are limited. Even with regard to the Customs itself, it has been seventy or eighty years since customs were established for trade. Could it be that the commissioners who served in the past completely disregarded tax collection, or that the importers of the past were completely unable to engage in profiteering? However, for seventy or eighty years, there has never been a case of searching shops, because the customs officials at that time were still able to adhere to the limits of authority granted to them by laws and regulations, and they were still able to fulfill their duties of searching goods upon entry into the port, rarely engaging in favoritism. Therefore, there was no need to exceed the scope and disturb shops. Therefore, if the Customs claims that there has been a recent increase in tax evasion, it can only blame the dereliction of duty of its subordinates and urgently think of ways to rectify the situation. It cannot use this as an excuse to exceed the scope. Goods entering the hands of shops have already separated from the importer and entered the retail merchant, and under current law, they only have the obligation to pay business tax. The authority to inspect them already belongs to the Business Tax Bureau. Recently, Sir Frederick Maze, the Inspector General of Customs, in view of the criticisms of public opinion, has misrepresented that searching shops is also practiced in various countries in the East and West, and is not an innovation of Jianghai Customs. These few words are sufficient to prove that the search of shops by Jianghai Customs not only lacks a legal basis, but also has not obtained the permission of the competent department. Therefore, he misrepresents the practice in various countries in the East and West in order to conceal his shortcomings. The power of officials is granted by the state and cannot be created by the officials themselves. If it is considered that this precedent should be adopted, it can only contribute opinions for the competent department to adopt. It cannot be implemented arbitrarily based on one's own personal intentions. The Customs is an agency that implements laws and regulations, not an agency that creates laws and regulations. Based on the above arguments, Customs Commissioner Robert Ford and Deputy Customs Commissioner George Wright of Jianghai Customs have acted illegally and exceeded their authority in handling this matter, and according to administrative regulations, there is reason for them to be subject to disciplinary action. As for the handling of tax collection matters in various trading ports, according to Article 7 of the Regulations for Employing Foreigners to Assist in Customs Affairs in the Third Year of Tongzhi, it is stated that "All public affairs should be managed by the Superintendent." However, the Customs Superintendent has sat idly by while they acted illegally and exceeded their authority. Although merchants have repeatedly appealed, he has not said a word of correction, which is also a neglect of duty. Therefore, we jointly request that your Yuan and Departments deliver them for disciplinary action to warn those in positions of authority, which is truly in the public interest.

<h3>Customs Building Ships to Suppress Smuggling</h3>
<p>Due to Rampant Smuggling and Tax Evasion</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News states that the tax rate on ordinary commodities under the old tariff regulations was very low, so the number of smugglers of ordinary commodities was limited. After the implementation of the new tariff regulations, smugglers of goods that did not pay taxes could obtain huge profits, and well-organized smuggling organizations were established one after another. Smuggled goods were no longer limited to jade, opium, morphine, military equipment, and valuable luxury goods. Even ordinary daily necessities could obtain huge profits through smuggling. Smuggling organizations charge fees according to the value of the goods, and many people are happy to use them, so their income is also very abundant. In the past two years, these people have been extremely active, and the number of ordinary commodities they smuggle is extremely large, but it is currently impossible to estimate the exact number. Recently, the shops searched by the Shanghai Customs have mostly been jewelry stores and watch stores. These items are easy to hide and are often placed in passengers' luggage or hidden on their persons. Some are also hidden in bulky goods, with ingenious designs that are not easy to detect. Mail parcels are also convenient for smuggling small items. Hong Kong and Dalian are now free ports and are close to various ports in China, so smugglers have used these places to establish headquarters. Today, most of the smuggling organizations in China are operated by Chinese, but some foreigners are also engaged in this business. According to news from the Hong Kong correspondent of the North-China Daily News, smuggling between Guangzhou and Hong Kong has been extremely rampant recently, and some even use political figures as protectors. Other ports along the South China coast are also connected to Hong Kong for smuggling, and the number is very large. The Customs is currently stepping up its prevention of this type of smuggling. Although it cannot be said to be as complete as the prevention system in Europe and America, it has already achieved remarkable results. The Customs has specially built many patrol boats for this purpose, some of which have been completed and put into use, and some are still under construction. On June 8th of this year, Mrs. Maze held a launching ceremony for a new patrol boat. Its interior has long been completely installed, and it was test-driven outside Wusongkou at the beginning of last month, and its speed is quite fast. There is also a sister ship of the same type, which is being built at the Jiangnan Shipyard and is about to be completed. It is expected that it will also be able to test-drive and be received this month. The customs officers on the new patrol boats have received strict training in the use of firearms, etc., to increase their effectiveness. According to a recent report from a new patrol boat inspecting the northern seas, the smuggling of sugar in Tianjin, Yantai, and other ports has been curbed due to strict inspections, and the price of sugar sold on the market has returned to normal prices and is no longer as low as the wholesale price as it was a few months ago. Now that the customs authorities have added patrol boats and stepped up prevention, it is expected that the trend of smuggling can be gradually suppressed and tax revenue can also be increased. At present, the tax expenses of European countries often increase sharply due to anti-smuggling measures. For example, Germany spends 30% of its total tax revenue on anti-smuggling expenses. The percentage of China's Customs' anti-smuggling expenses cannot be determined at present, but it is probably less than one-tenth of that of Germany.</p>

<h3>The Righteous Army Support Association Sends Representatives to Guangdong to Appeal</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Northeast Righteous Volunteer Army Support Association recently sent Wang Zhisheng, a director of the association, to Guangdong to appeal to the Southwest Executive Department and the Guangdong People's National Salvation Association to support the Northeast Righteous Army. Mr. Wang left Shanghai yesterday on the French mail ship Philippe, carrying the following original letter: "Dear Sirs, the Northeast Righteous Army has been fighting for the country and fighting bloody battles for a year. Internally, blood and ammunition are insufficient, and externally, relief is lacking. The situation is extremely difficult. Our association is using our meager strength to respond to the Righteous Army's call for support from home and abroad. In the past six months, although we have successively provided relief to the Righteous Army in Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang with the proceeds from donations, totaling approximately 200,000 yuan, the amount is not much and still feels like a drop in the bucket. Guangdong and Guangxi are the source of the revolution, and the unwavering anti-Japanese and national salvation sentiments are a model for the whole country. Your department leads the Southwest, and all the people look up to it. You will definitely be happy to provide support to the anti-Japanese lone army in the remote frontier. Now that Mr. Wang Zhisheng, the director of our association, is coming to Guangdong, we specially entrust him to pay his respects to your esteemed position and present our earnest requests, hoping that you will kindly consider and provide continued assistance to increase the combat capability of the 500,000 men in the Northeast. The recovery of lost territory in the future will depend on your great achievements. Looking up to the sky, we are overwhelmed with anticipation. We hereby respectfully convey our wishes, hoping that you will take them into consideration, etc. (The letter to the National Salvation Association is the same).</p>
<h3>Elementary School Students Enthusiastically Relieve the Northeast</h3>
<p>He Huifen Saves Pocket Money to Contribute Monthly</p>
<p>Zou Siyi is Willing to Save on Food Expenses</p>
<p>Since the Northeast Compatriot Relief Association launched the monthly donation campaign, all walks of life have expressed sympathy, as reported in previous newspapers. The other day, Mr. He Huifen sent a letter to Mr. Wang Xiaofan, the director of the donation group of the association, saying, "We elementary school students do not have the ability to kill the enemy, so we have to save our pocket money. Starting in November, we will donate ten yuan per month to fulfill our obligations as young citizens." Yesterday, Mr. Zou Siyi, a student at the Bide Elementary School, also sent a letter to the association, saying, "I see that resisting the enemy is worthy of everyone's admiration. We in the rear should do our best to help, so as to achieve the goal of recovering lost territory. Now I am requesting my parents to save twenty yuan per month from the family's food expenses to充作 monthly donations. Starting from November, I will send it to the bank for collection on the first of each month. I hope everyone will join in donating." The two elementary school students mentioned above are worthy of respect for expressing sympathy for the association and for the advice of students from various schools.</p>

<h3>Mayor Wu Held a Banquet Last Night for Various Sectors to Discuss Relief for the Three Provinces Disaster Area</h3>
<p>Nine people, including Wen Lanting, were elected</p>
<p>to establish a Preparatory Office for the Disaster Area Inspection Group</p>
<p>The three provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Hubei have suffered from communist bandit disasters for several years. At the beginning of June this year, the central government, adhering to the principle of pacifying the interior before resisting foreign aggression, ordered a general suppression. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek also went to Hubei Province to supervise the campaign, and military victories were achieved one after another, with the disaster areas gradually being recovered. However, the people were displaced, and the fields and homes were in ruins. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, recognizing that the disaster had already occurred and that famine was a cause for concern, telegraphed Wang Xiaolai, a leader of the Shanghai business community, to Xunyang to discuss the matter, resulting in the organization of the Shanghai Temporary Relief Association for the Henan, Anhui, and Hubei Disaster Areas. Mayor Wu, Zhang Gongquan, and leaders from various sectors were invited to serve as members of the association. In order to plan all the implementation measures, Mayor Wu and others hosted a banquet at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce at 7:00 PM yesterday, inviting over a hundred representatives from various sectors and organizations. During the banquet, representatives from the three provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Hubei reported on the disaster situation in their respective provinces, and nine people, including Wen Lanting and Liu Zhanen, were elected to establish a Preparatory Office for the Three Provinces Disaster Area Inspection Group, so that people from all walks of life could join in to inspect the real situation. The details are listed below:</p>
<h3>Relief Declaration</h3>
<p>A declaration from the Shanghai Temporary Relief Association for the Henan, Anhui, and Hubei Disaster Areas reads: Alas, our people have suffered from banditry for a long time. South of the Yellow River and north of the Yangtze River, cities and towns have been reduced to ruins, ancestral graves have been destroyed, the old and weak have been slaughtered, women have been driven away and humiliated, property has been completely plundered, livelihoods have been gradually cut off, and people and animals have been completely wiped out. Woe is me! Who did this? Who caused this? To make the tens of thousands of poor people in our several-thousand-mile disaster areas in three provinces displaced, destitute, and suffering to such an extreme? The ferocity of the disaster is so severe that, looking back to ancient times and surveying the world, there has never been a disaster as widespread and cruel as the current situation in the disaster-stricken areas of Henan, Anhui, and Hubei. Recently, Chief Military Commissioner Chiang, with his resolute spirit, has been engaged in the work of suppression for several months, and has gradually recovered Shangcheng, Guangshan, and Gushi in Henan, Yingshan, Huoqiu, Liu'an, and Huoshan in Anhui, and Huang'an, Macheng, Luotian, Mianyang, and Jianli in Hubei, which can also be said to have been difficult. However, with thousands of miles of devastation and millions of displaced people, who will pacify them? Who will comfort them? Although this is the responsibility of the authorities, it is also something that benevolent gentlemen cannot bear to sit idly by. Telegrams are sent from all directions, and reports come from all sides. Saving lives and alleviating suffering is a duty that cannot be shirked. This is why we have organized the Temporary Relief Association for the Henan, Anhui, and Hubei Disaster Areas. Everyone wants to do good. Who is not like us? To pull people out of fire and water and put them on a bed of comfort, who can we rely on if not our fathers, elders, siblings, aunts, and sisters at home and abroad? This declaration is respectfully submitted for your consideration.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu's Report</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu, representing the Temporary Relief Association for the Henan, Anhui, and Hubei Disaster Areas, gave the first report, saying: Today, our association is hosting this banquet for all representatives to seek relief for the disaster victims in the three provinces. Since the September 18th Incident in Shenyang last year, the public has been stirred up and focused on diplomatic issues, while neglecting internal problems, resulting in a failure to concentrate our strength to cope with this unprecedentedly serious situation. This situation is a combination of foreign troubles (i.e., the Northeast problem) and internal worries (i.e., the communist bandit problem). The people in the disaster areas of Henan, Anhui, and Hubei were either incited by poor politics or seduced by the communist bandits' propaganda (robbing the rich to help the poor) a few years ago, not realizing that they were opening the door to thieves. However, wherever the communist bandits went, they concentrated cash and food, forcing many people to flee to avoid starvation. As a result, the communist bandits' power expanded. This summer's general suppression has confined the communist bandits to a corner, so they are now engaged in looting. Therefore, the recovered areas are now a scorched earth. The fundamental task of restoring the disaster areas and eliminating the power of the communist bandits is to appease the displaced people and prevent the civilians who have been deceived by the communist bandits from being misled by their propaganda again. The significance of this relief is even greater. I hope that everyone will be generous and donate generously.</p>
<h3>Reports on the Disaster Situations</h3>
<p>After Mayor Wu's report, he</p>
<p>invited Sun Chunzhai and other representatives to report on the disaster situation in the three provinces. Sun Chunzhai said that the disaster-stricken areas in Anhui Province include Liu'an, Huoqiu, Huoshan, and Yingshan counties. The tragic situation there is beyond our imagination. Recently, there has been the organization of the "Bare Egg Society" in various places, which gathers villagers in one village to rob food from neighboring villages. When the food is exhausted, the villagers of that village go to other villages to rob food. After several such rounds, they can gather tens of thousands of people. The suffering can be imagined. Li Zizhong reported that the disaster-stricken areas in Henan Province include Shangcheng, Guangshan, Gushi, Luoshan, Xinyang, Xixian, and Huangchuan, with Huangchuan and Shangcheng being the most severely affected. When the communist bandits were entrenched, they concentrated property and forced the people to flee for food. Now that the communist bandits have been suppressed and are fleeing, although Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has ordered the pacification, the people's property has been plundered, and the fields and homes are in ruins. Even if they return, they have no clothes or food and cannot cultivate the land. Therefore, many go to Hankou to beg. Liu Zhanen reported on the disaster situation in Hubei Province, saying that although only Huang'an, Macheng, Luotian, Mianyang, and Jianli are considered disaster-stricken areas in Hubei Province, the impact on areas outside these five is also very significant. The tragedy is even worse than that of the Songhu area after the January 28th Incident, but because of the distance, the true situation is not clear. I hope that the gentry and scholars in Shanghai will not stand idly by, thinking that it has nothing to do with them. The commerce in Shanghai depends on the interior for sales. If the people in the interior cannot recover, they will have no purchasing power, and Shanghai will also be affected. We hope to raise one million this time for relief and distribution. Please donate generously.</p>
<h3>Organizing an Inspection Group</h3>
<p>After the representatives of the three provinces reported,</p>
<p>the discussion turned to the progress of fundraising and inspection of disaster areas, but because many committee members were not present, a decision on fundraising methods could not be made. As for the organization of the inspection group, the entire meeting agreed to nominate Wang Yansong, Wang Laixiao, Wen Lanting, Zhao Jinqing, Liu Zhanen, Huang Hanzhi, Ye Yuhu, Yu Xiji, and Pan Gongzhan as members of the preparatory committee. The committee will be located at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. In the future, any organizations or journalists in Shanghai who wish to understand the truth of the situation there can contact the preparatory committee and join them.</p>
<h3>Chiang's Telegram Requesting Inspection</h3>
<p>General Commander Chiang requested the various circles in Shanghai to organize an inspection group to inspect the recovered areas of Henan, Anhui, and Hubei: The Shanghai Temporary Relief Association for the Henan, Anhui, and Hubei Disaster Areas (omission) has received the telegram with respect. The communist bandit areas recovered in Henan, Anhui, and Hubei have been in a state of decline for a long time, and the disaster situation is severe. I am deeply grateful for your compassion and concern for the remaining people, and for your organization of a temporary relief association to prepare for the urgent relief of farmers and workers in the disaster areas. I admire your benevolent reputation. I hope that you will organize a group as soon as possible to inspect the disaster areas, design a detailed plan, and start implementation. I also urge you to actively raise relief funds. Once a certain amount has been collected, please inform the headquarters by telegram so that we can consider the disaster situation and allocate the funds. This is a special reply. I respectfully hope that you will take note of it. Chiang Kai-shek, seal.</p>
<h3>Chiang's Telegram Appealing for Relief</h3>
<p>General Commander Chiang telegraphed, appealing for relief for the areas affected by the bandits in Henan, Anhui, and Hubei: The Relief Committee of the National Government, charitable organizations, leaders, universities, and newspapers are all informed. I, Chiang Kai-shek, am ordered to be stationed in Hankou to suppress the Red bandits. Fortunately, the military and government, both high and low, are of one mind and work together to overcome obstacles and gradually eliminate the bandits. However, in the recovered areas, everything has been plundered. There is no house that has not been burned, no tree that has not been felled, no chickens or dogs left, and no cattle spared. According to reports from front-line generals in the past half-month, places such as Shangcheng, Guangshan, and Gushi in Henan, Liu'an, Huoqiu, Huoshan, and Yingshan in Anhui, and Huang'an, Macheng, Luotian, Mianyang, and Jianli in Hubei are all remote areas, desolate and devoid of smoke. Only the sound of weeping can be heard. Thousands or even tens of thousands of people are kneeling before the army, emaciated and haggard, lying on the side of the road. After reading these reports, I was heartbroken. I have already telegraphed the governments of the three provinces to expedite the relief and send personnel to provide assistance. I have also promulgated measures to reduce or exempt land taxes in the bandit suppression areas for compliance, in order to provide stability. However, the recovered areas have been in a state of decline for a long time, and the disaster is deep. There are many people waiting for relief, and the areas in need of relief are extensive. The relief funds are limited, and the relief is minimal. Winter is coming soon, and it is unbearable to imagine death from freezing and starvation. I deeply believe that when hunger and cold reach the body, even a loving mother cannot protect her child. Since ancient times, famine has been the source of great chaos, and after great chaos is pacified, it is followed by famine. These are mutually causal. If we do not properly plan for the aftermath, local stability and the restoration of order will never be possible. Therefore, I hope that people's organizations, charitable institutions, and wealthy households will do their best to collect large sums of money for relief, and report the amount collected to the headquarters for verification and allocation. You should know that in this time of disasters, to save oneself, one must first save others. If the country is not peaceful, how can the family be protected? You should also know that saving people is not just a matter of compassion, but also a matter of duty. You should actively donate to give the survivors hope of rebirth, to share joys and sorrows equally, and to give society a chance to recover. The misfortunes, blessings, safety, and danger are shared by the people of the whole country. Furthermore, since the outbreak of the war, not only has the turmoil been more severe than in the past, but also frugality has been less than in the past. The cities are becoming more and more extravagant, and the suffering of the countryside is deepening. If this trend continues, even without foreign troubles, we will not be able to avoid ruin. I also hope that leaders of all schools and organizations, as well as women's circles, will organize inspection groups to visit the disaster areas in batches to understand the truth and seek relief. The headquarters will pay attention to protection and provide convenience during their inspection trips. The whole country should be aware of this tragedy and promote simplicity and frugality, eliminate extravagance, restore the countryside, and promote the sale of agricultural products, which is the common goal and path for our people to follow. I hope you will give it careful consideration. Chiang Kai-shek, 30th secret.</p>
<h3>Feng Yuxiang Telegraphed Luo to Refute Rumors</h3>
<p>Hua Dong News Agency reports that since Feng Yuxiang left Mount Tai and went to Zhangjiakou, rumors have spread like wildfire. Feng Yuxiang telegraphed Luo Wen’gan, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, some time ago to refute the rumors. The telegram was released yesterday by Feng’s representative stationed in Shanghai, as follows: Urgent! Minister Luo Junren, Nanjing, greetings. Secret political matter. I have received your telegram with respect. Regarding the third item, which states that the Japanese side is spreading rumors that I, Feng Yuxiang, am joining forces with Han Fuju and Wu Peifu to support Duan Qirui and Zhang Zuolin in order to remove Tang Shengzhi and restore the monarchy, it is ridiculous. Since I have been recuperating, I have had very little news other than reading. Moreover, my history and thoughts are well known to you. In the past, I denounced the restoration of the monarchy, drove away Puyi, overthrew the warlords, and opposed dictatorship. How could I today make the mistake of supporting Duan Qirui and restoring the monarchy? As for the second item, regarding the infighting between Lu Zhonglin and others, and the banditry of the communists, I am not in power and cannot answer on their behalf. Please ask those who hold military power today to be responsible for the turmoil. Furthermore, in the second chapter of the Lytton Report, when describing the revolutionary events in the capital, there is a phrase that Feng Yuxiang betrayed his superior. I think you will remember it. If it is said that I, together with Sun Yat-sen, jointly attacked the election bribery and drove out the remnants of the imperial system, it is a betrayal of my superior, then all revolutionaries are suspected of betrayal, and how can the National Government, which was produced by the National Revolution, justify itself? This matter is extremely relevant to the National Government's international standing. I hope you can refute it. This is a special reply. Your brother, Feng Yuxiang, respectfully.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications Instructs the Directorate General of Posts to Restore Postal Remittances and Parcels in Bandit Areas</h3>
<p>The Directorate General of Posts received instructions from the Ministry of Communications yesterday, stating that the Secretariat of the General Headquarters for the Suppression of Bandits in the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui had issued a letter from Zeng Zhaoming requesting that the post office be instructed to immediately find ways to restore postal remittances and parcels in the recovered bandit areas. The original letter from Zeng Zhaoming was also attached to the Ministry. After reviewing the letter, it is clear that the matters described in the letter are essential for rescuing the victims. It is known that the disaster areas have just been recovered, and the remnants may not have been completely cleared. The overall environment is less favorable than normal. A sudden decision to restore postal areas and parcels will inevitably cause various difficulties for the post office. However, the postal service is a state-run enterprise, focusing on convenience for the public, and the matter is related to the relief of disaster areas. Efforts should be made to fulfill the responsibilities. The letter from Zeng Zhaoming is hereby copied and sent to the Directorate General of Posts for compliance and re-instruction to promptly consider and restore the service as soon as possible, and report the handling situation for review. This order.</p>

The customers who visited the shop and the various departments of the commercial center on the second floor were extremely crowded, which was rare in Shanghai. The Ningbo Industrial Bank also established a savings department and a gift certificate department in the commercial center, which was especially convenient for ladies and gentlemen from all walks of life. The various national products on display were all products of famous factories, colorful and dazzling. The silks and satins and leather goods were exquisite in color and pattern. Because of their low price and high quality, they were purchased by all sectors with pleasure.

<h3>The Sales Volume of the Shen Bao Monthly Magazine Has Increased Sharply</h3>
<p>Ong Zhaoyuan's Memoirs of the Songhu Blood Battle Will Be Published as a Separate Volume</p>
<p>The Shen Bao Monthly Magazine, launched by the Shen Bao in July this year to commemorate its 60th anniversary, has been extremely well received by all sectors since its publication. Not long after publication, the first and second issues were sold out. After the reprint of the book in the middle of this month, it will also be sold out in less than two weeks. Because of the busy workload, the monthly magazine originally did not intend to print a third edition. However, the sales volume has recently increased sharply, and eight or nine out of ten subscribers have requested to subscribe from the first issue. Therefore, the magazine had no choice but to prepare to reprint the third edition of the first and second issues, and add prints of the second edition of the third and fourth issues to meet the needs of this year's commemorative subscribers. The fifth issue is still in printing, and the number of copies has been increased to avoid the trouble of reprinting in the future. In addition, Ong Zhaoyuan's Memoirs of the Songhu Blood Battle, which has been serialized in the magazine since the third issue, will be completed in the sixth issue. The separate volume will be published in early January next year as the first title in the Shen Bao Monthly Magazine series, and there will be a special price offer, which will be announced soon.</p>

<h3>200,000 Shanghai Residents Go to Sanbei to Watch the Fair</h3>
<p>High Platforms and Pavilions Are Renowned Far and Wide</p>
<p>Costing 2 Million Yuan</p>
<p>The Sanbei High Platforms and Pavilions Fair has not been held for 29 years. This year, the village is preparing for three days of competition, costing 1 million yuan. Today is the first day. Including yesterday, at least 200,000 men and women from Shanghai have gone to Ningbo to watch the fair. Even from Wuhan and other places, a large number of tourists have gone to watch. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Ship Crowds</h3>
<p>This Sanbei High Platforms and Pavilions Fair is the third time it has been held after the competition. There are fifteen platforms and pavilions, each 36 feet high, carried by 120 people, performing various dramas, and there are also stilts, flesh-body lanterns, etc. Since the preparation, it has been rumored far and wide. In the last ten days, Shanghai residents who have gone to watch, the Shanghai-Ningbo passenger ships Xinjing Tian, Xin Beijing, Xin Ning Shao, Hongxing, and Ningxing have been fully loaded every day. There is no room for latecomers. Including yesterday, more than 200,000 people have gone to Ningbo and transferred to Sanbei to watch the fair. Even from Wuhan, a large number of tourists have taken the Yangtze River ship to Shanghai and then transferred to the Ningbo ship to Sanbei to watch the fair.</p>
<h3>Inland River Blockage</h3>
<p>According to Ningbo ship crew members, since</p>
<p>the 3rd of this month, the river channel of the Cibei inland river has been blocked by civilian boats and rafts. Within this fair period, it will take at least two weeks to restore traffic. The freight transport in various places has also been suspended. The sedan chairs from Yejiashan to Dongbutou have been fully hired. The Sanbei houses have been raised to ten yuan per room for three days. The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway has also increased trains to transport viewers.</p>
<h3>Telegraph to Shanghai to Welcome Du</h3>
<p>Shen Yushan, the head of the Sanbei</p>
<p>family who is organizing the High Platforms and Pavilions Fair, telegraphed Yu Qiaqing, Du Yuesheng, and others in Shanghai yesterday, saying that the fair is well-organized, and he fears that there are rumors from afar, so he hopes not to believe them lightly. You are respected by the villagers, and they sincerely ask you to come and stop, and your viewing is very important. Therefore, I especially send a telegram for you to come, and please indicate the itinerary so that I can respectfully welcome you. Shen Yushan.</p>
<h3>Huge Spending</h3>
<p>When the High Platforms and Pavilions are on the move, the area occupied is very large, so the houses are demolished and the road is paved in advance before it can be held. The three-day fair costs millions of yuan, and the various travel expenses of people from all over the world are also more than one million yuan. The Zhejiang Provincial Government has specially dispatched two companies of soldiers to Cixi to suppress the area through which the fair passes. Lu Siyi, director of the Cixi Public Security Bureau, also led the entire police force and the self-defense regiment to Sanbei to protect it.</p>
<h3>Silk Fabric Identification Is Actively Underway</h3>
<p>Buyers of Silk Can Check the Certificate at the End of Every Four Bolts</p>
<p>The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, in view of the recent mixed quality of silk fabrics and the difficulty in distinguishing them, in order to promote pure silk fabrics made in China, save merchants' ethics, and facilitate the recognition of the public, began to identify silk fabrics on the 11th of this month. Silk factories such as Jinyun have already requested identification, totaling more than a thousand bolts. Miao Zhongxiu, director of the Silk Inspection Department of the bureau, and Guo Limao, a technician, and other technicians went to the Dachang Refining Factory to stamp the silk fabrics to be identified with a certificate stamp at one end of the silk fabrics. In the future, if buyers of silk fabrics want to purchase pure silk fabrics made in China, they can check the certificate at the end of each bolt to identify them, so as not to be fooled. The bureau also received a letter from the Meiyi Dyeing and Finishing Factory yesterday, stating that the factory refines about 30,000 bolts of silk every month and requesting the bureau to send personnel to the factory to identify silk fabrics. The letter has been approved and handed over to the Silk Inspection Department for consideration.</p>
<h3>The Silk Industry Will Hold a Meeting to Discuss Relief for Foreign Trade</h3>
<p>Vietnamese Guests Talk About the Situation of Chinese Silk Being Hit Hard</p>
<p>The National News Agency reports that Chinese silk has been hit hard by increased tariffs in various countries and competition from Japanese silk in recent years, and foreign trade has been completely stagnant. A reporter interviewed two Vietnamese overseas Chinese who recently returned to China and learned about the situation of Chinese silk in Vietnam, as follows:</p>
<h3>Alarming Increase in Customs Duties</h3>
<p>A representative said that before the Sino-French New Treaty was signed in the 19th year of the Republic of China, silk, tea, porcelain and other goods transported from our country enjoyed a special tariff because they did not have a significant conflict with French goods. At that time, Chinese goods in Vietnam could be sold smoothly. After the initial signing of the New Treaty, overseas Chinese deeply felt that the transportation of Chinese goods to Vietnam would be greatly affected. Although they had repeatedly telegraphed to our Ministry of Foreign Affairs to pay attention to the content of the New Treaty, our government soon announced its implementation, while the French side did not make any announcement and has not yet approved it, which has been delayed for two years and five months. According to the New Treaty, it is stipulated that the term is five years and it may need to be revised. During these two years and five months, overseas Chinese in Vietnam are treated like citizens of countries without treaties. Chinese goods entering Vietnam are also subject to the collection of tariffs as countries without treaties, from special tariffs (i.e., the lowest tariffs) to equal tariffs, plus two or three times to eight or nine times to even ten times the original tax. This increase in customs duties is truly alarming.</p>
<h3>Japanese Silk Benefits from Tax</h3>
<p>As a result, Chinese goods have to disappear from Vietnam because of the huge transportation costs and high tariffs. At the same time, Japanese goods replace Chinese goods. According to a new treaty established between Japan and France in May of this year, the goods that Chinese goods previously enjoyed the most-favored-nation treatment in Vietnam are now also enjoyed by Japan. As a result, Japanese goods are everywhere in the market. Overseas Chinese are heartbroken, but they can't do anything because they are in a foreign country.</p>
<h3>Urgent Need to Seek Remedies</h3>
<p>In recent years, the motherland has suffered from internal wars and the devastation of the communists, as well as the oppression and abuse of imperialist powers and strong neighbors. The national economy is already in a state of bankruptcy, commerce is stagnant, and society is restless. To seek remedies, the key figures in the central government must eliminate selfish opinions and unite to face foreign countries. In addition to seeking a peaceful and prosperous life for fellow countrymen at home, overseas Chinese should also be taken care of. The products of the industrial sector must be refined and improved. In foreign trade, we must pay attention to international commercial integrity and must not be careless, transporting inferior goods to foreign countries and losing credibility abroad. It is important to know that overseas Chinese urgently welcome the smooth sale of Chinese goods in foreign countries.</p>
<h3>Silk Weaving Industry to Hold Discussions</h3>
<p>The leaders of the silk weaving industry in this city, in view of the fact that the export sales of silk fabrics have plummeted due to the high tariffs imposed by various countries, have deeply worried about the national economy and the people's livelihood. In addition, the representative of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Cochinchina, Vietnam, returned to the country to petition, which made them feel that the matter was urgent. It is heard that discussions will be held soon to discuss solutions for relief.</p>
<h3>Yang Jianping Resigns as Director of the Savings and Remittance Bureau</h3>
<p>Yang Jianping, Director of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, telegraphed Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Communications yesterday, stating that he was submitting his resignation for review. I was appointed to this position in January of this year, and it has been nine months since then. With my humble talents, I have been mistakenly entrusted with important tasks. My rope is short and the well is deep, and I am in constant danger of failing. In addition, at the beginning of my appointment, I encountered the Shanghai Incident, which made it difficult to carry out the bureau's affairs. Furthermore, the postal panic in May had some impact on the savings and remittance business. I still racked my brains to try to develop it. Even during the market downturn, the amount of savings and remittances still increased. Now that the situation has stabilized and the market has gradually stabilized, the bureau's business urgently needs to be expanded. With my exhausted mind and energy, I am deeply afraid that I will not be able to cope with this important task. Rather than causing mistakes in the future, I would rather relinquish my responsibilities today. After thinking again and again, I can only submit my resignation to make way for the talented. All reasons for resignation are hereby submitted in writing for your approval. I respectfully request your approval and humbly ask you to appoint capable and virtuous individuals to take over as soon as possible. I am truly grateful.</p>

<h3>Telegrams Concerning the Rice License Tax in Anhui</h3>
<p>Wu Zhongxin replied to the Anhui groups: To the gentlemen of Anhui who are abroad, as reported by Shanghai newspapers, Zhongxin has governed Anhui for several months. All kinds of harsh and detailed taxes in the past, such as the special business tax, have been abolished one after another. Only the rice license tax has been designated by the central government as a special fund for road construction and is collected by a separate committee. In addition, the total budget of the province is more than 16 million yuan. After two rounds of reduction, it is now only more than 9 million yuan. The new budget will be implemented on November 1st of this year. I am afraid that the gentlemen are abroad and do not know all the details, or that the transmission is inaccurate. I hereby telegraph to inform you. Wu Zhongxin bows and sings.</p>
<p>The Anhui Association in Beijing opposed the rice license tax express mail telegram (titles omitted): Everyone, Recently, I read in the newspaper that the Anhui Provincial Government has suddenly restored the Food Administration Bureau of Chen Tiaoyuan's era, created a rice license tax in disguise of likin, and announced Li Yunqi, Lu Zhongnong, Yu Youquan, and others as members, and also directors of the rice license tax bureaus in Wuhu, Bengbu, Dashengguan, and other places. In addition, bureaus were established in Dashengguan, Xuanbu, Chenjiaqian, Wuyi, Tangyi, Jieshou, Jihua County, Wuhu, Bengbu, Anqing, Datong, Meihe, Huayang, Jiangba, Mingguang, Suxian, Linhuaiguan, and other places, and more than 30 people, including Yu Xianggu, Shu Tiexiang, Du Dongjiao, and Wang Lantian, were appointed as directors and inspectors. Such a large group of corrupt people is distributed throughout the north and south of Anhui Province. The harm they will cause is probably even worse than floods and fierce beasts. According to the published rules, a tax of 6 jiao is levied on each dan of rice exported by sailboat, 4 jiao by wheel transport, and 3 jiao on miscellaneous grains. The tax is several times higher than the previous likin. After years of natural disasters and banditry in Anhui, the people are almost all destitute, with starving corpses everywhere and wailing sounds filling the wilderness. The rural economy has indeed gone bankrupt. This year, except for the drought-stricken areas, there may be some rice and grain that can be exported, hoping to use it to regulate the social economy and seek the recovery of agriculture and commerce. However, the provincial authorities are bent on fulfilling their personal plans, colluding with shameless provincial officials, wantonly plundering, and without any scruples. They can absorb the blood and sweat of the common people, even if they wail and cry, they can turn a deaf ear. All of you are from Anhui. I don't know why you are so cruel. Moreover, when Chen Tiaoyuan established this tax last year, it was opposed by merchants throughout Anhui, and the Supervisory Yuan also filed an impeachment on the grounds that it conflicted with the central government's order to abolish likin. The Yuan and Ministry repeatedly ordered it to be abolished. How can we now violate the law and disobey public opinion, and revive this harsh policy that harms the people and the country in Anhui? As long as we have a breath left, we swear that we cannot recognize it. We hope that all our fellow Anhui compatriots will rise up together, resolutely resist, and demand that the provincial government abolish this chaotic order as soon as possible to relieve the people's suffering and maintain the law. If the provincial authorities are blinded by profit and cannot be persuaded, then our 30 million Anhui people must be of one mind, unite together, and support the rice merchants, resolutely refuse to pay this illegal tax, and at the same time organize the people's strength, and take immediate action in their respective locations to stop the establishment of this illegal bureau. If there are corrupt officials who disregard integrity, violate the public opinion of the entire Anhui Province, and rely on their authority to forcibly collect taxes, they are abandoning themselves to the people of Anhui. Then our compatriots in each of these places should make the greatest determination and impose strict sanctions. The members of this association vow to use all their strength as a backing for our oppressed compatriots. On the verge of sending this telegram, I am filled with emotion and do not know what to say. Anhui Association in Beijing bows.</p>
<h3>Zha Liangzhao Comes South to Clarify Right and Wrong</h3>
<p>Came to Shanghai to File a Lawsuit for the Anhui North Relief Affairs</p>
<p>The Anhui Association previously filed a lawsuit against the relief personnel in the Shanghai First Special District Court, listing Zha Liangzhao, a member of the Flood Relief Association, as the fourth defendant. Two court sessions have now been held. When Zha was sued, he was in Beiping and was suffering from hemorrhoids. Upon hearing the news, he telegraphed lawyer Zhang Xingyan to appear in court on his behalf. Zha has now come to Shanghai on the night before last (the 4th) specifically for this case, and his hemorrhoids have not fully recovered. Yesterday morning, he first went to the office of the Flood Relief Association to arrange a date to meet with Chairman Song of the association to report everything, and plans to ask a lawyer to urge the court to resume the trial as soon as possible in order to clarify the right and wrong, so as not to affect the progress of the relief efforts. The following is a record of Zha's conversation and his telegrams with Xu Shiying.</p>
<h3>Zha's Statement</h3>
<p>The Anhui North relief dispute began in the spring with a small number of Anhui North gentry attacking Quan Shaowu, the special commissioner of the relief affairs, and culminated in the recent lawsuit filed by the Anhui Association in Shanghai, Xu Shiying, and others in the Shanghai First Special District Local Court. In the meantime, right and wrong have been reversed, confusing social perceptions. Therefore, the truth of the matter must be made clear to the world, so that people's hearts can be rectified and relief affairs can be maintained. Since serving on the National Government Flood Relief Committee for a year, I have been diligent and selfless, and I am confident that I have not been selfish or violated the law. This time I came south, first for the sake of the personal credit and reputation of the relief personnel, and also for the honor of the entire National Government Flood Relief Committee and the credibility of various relief organizations in society. Second, I want to uphold justice, pay attention to the truth of the matter, and the court's judgment. After the right and wrong have been proven, I will protect those who are right and straight, and sanction those who are wrong and crooked, so that those who faithfully serve the society can bravely take on responsibilities, and those who reverse right and wrong and deceive society can disappear. The actions of the Anhui Association in Shanghai this time disregard the truth, and do not ask about the authority and responsibilities of the Flood Relief Committee. I believe it is the work of a small number of people. However, it is difficult to speculate on their intentions. Is it being fooled and deceived, or is it deliberately fabricating facts to damage personal reputation and the future of relief efforts? This layer is currently being investigated. Now I personally hope that the court will make a ruling on the right and wrong as soon as possible, so that the society can understand the truth and uphold justice, he said.</p>
<h3>Telegrams</h3>
<p>(1) Zha telegraphed Xu Shiying: Xu Jingren, member of the National Government Flood Relief Committee in Qiupu, I have hemorrhoids and underwent surgery in Tianjin. I have just been discharged from the hospital and came to Beiping. I read in various newspapers that the Anhui Association in Shanghai, led by you, filed a lawsuit in the Shanghai First Court for Anhui North relief affairs. I am also one of the defendants. After reading it, I am half-believing and half-doubting. Moreover, the allegations in the lawsuit do not match the facts. However, the matter concerns national relief and personal reputation, and the truth should be thoroughly investigated. I think you are a veteran of the country and a major person in charge of the relief association, so you should not follow the rumors and catch shadows. I am not yet convenient to express myself lightly. However, I would like to ask you to telegraph your intentions for leading the lawsuit. Zha Liangzhao bows. (2) Zha telegraphed the National Government Flood Relief Committee: Chairman Song of the Shanghai National Government Flood Relief Committee, I have just learned that Xu Shiying and others have filed a lawsuit in the Shanghai First Court for the Anhui North relief dispute, and have implicated Liangzhao, seriously defaming our association. Please listen to me carefully. I am filled with emotion. I have served the society, cherished my reputation, and valued it more than my life. The details of my handling of the Anhui North relief affairs are on file. If there are illegal facts as alleged, I will certainly bind myself to confess my guilt and apologize to the people of the country. Moreover, the plaintiffs first disregarded the facts and arbitrarily framed them. Second, they did not ask about the authority and responsibilities of our association and weaved charges against individuals. The spread of this matter is quite confusing, but it is even more important to the association's employment and the future of relief efforts. The truth should be thoroughly investigated. Please advocate for a thorough investigation to clarify the right and wrong. Furthermore, I am suffering from hemorrhoids and underwent surgery. I will come south to take care of the matter and explain everything as soon as I recover. I will first telegraph to inform you. Zha Liangzhao bows. (3) Xu Shiying replied to Zha's telegram: Brother Zha Mianzhong, I have respectfully received your telegram. The Anhui relief lawsuit took place in August. At that time, I was on leave to visit my father's illness in my hometown and did not hear about it. I returned to Shanghai on September 9th and learned that the association had followed the usual practice of listing the standing committee member's name as the first. I immediately stated my reasons to the association and asked lawyer Li Shirui to withdraw the case from the court on the 10th. I have recently received a telegram from Shanghai stating that the association has also published a correction in the newspaper. I am one of the members of the National Government Relief Committee and should be responsible for both merits and demerits. How can I file a lawsuit in my personal capacity? My duties and personality are at stake, and I will never do this. I specially reply to offer my condolences and gratitude. Your brother, Ying, bows. (4) Zha telegraphed Xu Shiying again: Xu Jingren, Qiupu, I have received your telegram. The Anhui relief lawsuit has reversed right and wrong, confused public opinion, and damaged personal reputation greatly. It has had even more impact on the future of relief efforts. You are from Anhui and are in charge of national relief efforts. You have a thorough understanding of the truth. Rather than showing that you are sharing the merits and demerits, you should rather uphold justice to rectify people's hearts and maintain your reputation. I hope you will make a wise decision. Zha Liangzhao bows.</p>

<h3>Change of Location for the Two Railway Passenger Stations</h3>
<p>Land Acquisition Reduced by Over 700 Mu</p>
<p>The new location for the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railway passenger terminal was surveyed by the Ministry of Railways near Zhenru. After the Ministry of Interior Affairs announced the land requisition, the residents within the designated area repeatedly petitioned for a reduction in the acquisition area due to its excessive size. The Ministry of Railways, in an effort to improve the layout and after further consideration, ultimately decided to slightly modify the original plan. All land south of the railway, originally intended for acquisition, was reduced by 198 meters from the railway side, resulting in a reduction of approximately 1,400 mu of land. Additionally, a piece of land west of Zhongshan Road and north of Jiaotong Road, approximately 700 mu in area, was purchased for the construction of various train depots and transfer tracks. This resulted in a net reduction of approximately 700 mu compared to the previously designated area. A request has been submitted to the Ministry of Interior Affairs for a re-announcement, ordering the administrations of the two railways to comply with the drawn boundaries within the acquisition area and to erect boundary markers for identification. A letter has also been sent to the Shanghai Municipal Government to announce the acquisition and to assist the Land Department of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways Construction Committee in handling all acquisition procedures.</p>

<h3>Qi Rengxi Appeals Zhang Meili Case</h3>
<p>Qi Rengxi, formerly of the Guanhai Evening News and a native of Fujian, had an affair with his wife's younger sister, Zhang Meili, and cohabitated. They have now had seven children. Last winter, they developed animosity towards each other. Qi filed a lawsuit in the Second Special Court's Civil Division to end the relationship with Zhang. At the same time, Zhang filed a criminal self-accusation against Qi for offenses against public morals, and the two counter-sued each other. When the criminal lawsuits ended after two trials, Meili was defeated. She then continued with the civil suit. Zhang also filed a civil counterclaim, requesting that Qi be ordered to pay 140,000 yuan for the living and educational expenses of the children. It was then judged that both parties were allowed to end the relationship, and Qi was ordered to pay 500 yuan per month for the children's living and educational expenses. All of this has been reported in previous issues. It is now known that Qi Rengxi has expressed dissatisfaction with the original ruling regarding the payment of expenses. He believes that the children can be taken back for rearing and does not want to pay the expenses. He has presented reasons and hired a lawyer to submit a petition to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, filing an appeal. The High Court, based on the petition, summoned both parties to the court the day before yesterday, where Judge Zhao Zhenhai opened the third civil court for trial. First, the appellant, Qi Rengxi, stated his reasons for dissatisfaction and requested that the original judgment be revoked and a new judgment be issued. The respondent, Zhang Meili, stated that if the appellant can abide by the original judgment and pay the expenses on a monthly basis, then the children can move between the two parties in the future, etc. The court then instructed the two parties to go outside to reconcile and rescheduled the hearing.</p>

<h3>Record of Gao Weicai Seducing and Abducting a Female Worker</h3>
<p>Met on the Road and Forcibly Taken Home</p>
<p>Sentenced to Eight Months Imprisonment After Trial</p>
<p>Ding Xiuying, a woman from Yangzhou, is 28 years old, petite and exquisite. She has been working as a female worker in the fine yarn room of the Shenxin No. 7 Yarn Factory in Yangshupu. She lives at No. 35, Taopeng Road, Eight Li Lane. Her mother, Mrs. Chen, is 36 years old and widowed. She cherishes her daughter like a pearl. On the morning of November 25th, around 5:00 AM, Xiuying carried her work clothes and lunch basket to the factory for work. While passing through Pingliang Road, she met Gao Weicai, a fellow villager aged 20. He had known her for a long time and desired to marry her. When he met her on the road, he stepped forward, grabbed her hand, and snatched her work clothes and lunch basket. He used the excuse of going to Nanjing Road to play and dragged her onto the No. 8 tram. They transferred to a public bus at the Bund and went to Caojiadu Yidingpan Road. He pulled her to his home at No. 129 Ziyou Lane and locked her in the bedroom. He teased her in every possible way. At this point, Xiuying had no way to escape. It was as if she had entered a cage. No matter how she called for help, no one responded. She could only let him do as he pleased. She was raped, and her virtue was tarnished. The next day, she planned to return home, but she was not familiar with the road and had no money in her pocket. She was isolated and lost. Thinking of returning home, she was also afraid of her mother's blame. She was truly in a dilemma. After living there for five days, Gao's cousin, Huichang, secretly went to the home of Xiuying's mother, Ding Chen, and said, "Your daughter Xiuying has been taken care of. At least thirty yuan to go abroad can be used to find her." Mrs. Chen knew that this was what these people had done. She took the opportunity to go out and report to the Yulin Road Police Station, which sent Detective Ruan Taibin to arrest Gao Huichang and take him to the police station. After questioning, they learned the whereabouts of Miss Ding and rushed to Gao's house. They brought Xiuying out and she was taken back by her mother. Gao Huichang was sent to the First Special District Court to await sentencing. The day before yesterday afternoon, Hua Tan Ruan Taibin, who was handling this case, continued to apprehend Gao Weicai. Yesterday morning, Judge Shen Bingrong presided over the interrogation at the Third Criminal Court. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, detailed the previous situation and stated that Gao Huichang, the defendant's brother, was only an accomplice and had nothing to do with the abduction, so he did not propose him as a witness. Then, Miss Ding Xiuying and her mother, Mrs. Chen, explained the previous situation. They questioned the defendant's confession that in May of this year, he lived at No. 44 Linqing Road, and the plaintiffs, mother and daughter, also lived there. He said that he and the plaintiffs, mother and daughter, also lived there, and that he was very familiar with them. Xiuying's grandmother allowed him to marry her, and he had asked friends to act as matchmakers. The rest of his confession was evasive, saying that he and Xiuying met on the No. 8 tram that morning, and she was willing to follow him home as his wife, etc. When Xiuying heard this, she was greatly displeased and scolded him. Judge Shen instructed the police lawyer, Zhang, to argue. He then sentenced Gao Zhaocai to six months imprisonment in court as a warning.</p>
<h3>Wang Ao-xi Case Extended for Further Trial</h3>
<p>The Police Department Has Not Yet Officially Prosecuted</p>
<p>Wang Ao-xi from Sichuan came to Shanghai last autumn and founded the "New Continent Daily." He often made provocative remarks, hoping to sow discord among various parties. The authorities sealed the newspaper and issued an arrest warrant. However, Wang remained oblivious and, together with Jiao Dao-song, a current member of the Military Affairs Commission, organized the "Power Society." Nanjing, considering their activities to be subversive, sent special agents to Shanghai to cooperate with detectives from the Public Concession Police to arrest Wang and Jiao at the China Hotel. Various manuscripts were seized from Wang, and they were handed over to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court for interrogation and detention pending further investigation. This has already been reported in this paper. This case was originally a request for assistance from the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau. The bureau had previously sent personnel to the Second Branch Court to request extradition, but the police lawyer stated that the "New Continent Daily" case occurred in the concession. Therefore, the police were still considering whether to prosecute Wang et al., and the extradition issue was temporarily shelved. Yesterday morning was the date for the continued trial. However, after considering the matter, the police still have not reached any conclusions as to whether or not to prosecute. A decision will be made after the verdict in the "New Continent Daily" case is announced. It is said that the verdict will be announced within days. Therefore, the police lawyer Li Zhi-shan specifically requested a one-week extension yesterday, while the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau still sent a legal advisor, lawyer Zhan Ji-feng, to the court to request extradition. Wang Ao-xi has retained lawyer Jiang Yi-ping to represent him in his defense. Judge Yu approved the police's request and ordered Wang et al. to be returned to custody. Therefore, whether this case will be extradited to the Public Security Bureau or handled by the Concession Court will not be known until the next hearing.</p>

<h3>Case of Car Accident on Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway</h3>
<p>Village Girl Injured in Collision</p>
<p>Driver Who Caused Accident Still Not Identified</p>
<p>Quan-zhen, the 13-year-old daughter of Gu Bing-gen, a resident of Fanwang Village, Seventh District, Fengxian County, Pudong, was walking past the Shagou Bridge on the afternoon of the 16th of last month when she was hit by a car with Public Concession license plate No. 11663 and Shanghai Municipal Government license plate No. 9150, which was speeding from Hangzhou to Shanghai. She suffered fatal injuries and died. The car did not stop after the accident but sped to Shanghai. The local villagers recorded the license plate number and reported it to the authorities, who sent personnel to investigate. It was found that the car belonged to the Fada Car Company on Xiafei Road in the French Concession. Yao Guangzhao, the local security chief, accompanied by witnesses, came to Shanghai and went directly to the Fada Car Company to identify the driver as Zhang Siwu. He reported this to the Fengxian County Government, which transferred the document to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau and reported it to the police department of the French Concession to send detectives to investigate. They found that there was no such person as Zhang Siwu at the Fada Car Company. The person they identified was Yan Miaojin. Yan was immediately taken to the police station and sent to the Second Criminal Court of the Second Special Court yesterday. After questioning by Judge Zhang Chao-zuo, the police lawyer first stated the case, followed by the family of the deceased complaining about the circumstances of the collision and requesting permission to transfer the defendant to the inland authorities for trial. Yan Miaojin confessed that he was indeed Yan Miaojin, not Zhang Siwu. He worked as a coppersmith at the Fada Car Company, not as a driver. Moreover, after checking the car company, there was no car that went to Hangzhou on the 16th of last month. He requested a clear investigation. Lin Rongliu, the manager of the Fada Car Company, also stated that the company did not have a car that was on a business trip on the 16th of last month and had records to prove it, requesting verification. Furthermore, the company did not have a person named Zhang Siwu. Yao Guangzhao, the local security chief of Fengxian County, also stated that after the accident, he accompanied witnesses to the defendant's car company to identify the defendant as the driver who caused the accident. At that time, when asked his name, he replied that his surname was Zhang and invited them to talk in the relief room. Later, Lu Xianglin, the dispatcher of the car company, sent people several times to mediate, but the matter was not settled. Zhou Bo-ang, the lawyer representing the plaintiff, stated that when the security chief and others went to the car company to inquire, the defendant admitted that his surname was Zhang, so Zhang Siwu was prosecuted. In short, there was witness testimony proving that the driver was indeed the defendant, who should be held responsible. The defendant was defended by lawyer Du Jimei, who stated that the plaintiff's claim was against Zhang Siwu, but the defendant was now Yan Miaojin, which was an error in the subject of the lawsuit. Moreover, the Fada Car Company's business trip records proved that there was no car that went to Hangzhou on that day. He requested that the case be dismissed. Judge Zhang announced the end of the debate and ruled that the defendant in this case was not Zhang Siwu and could not be extradited. The lawyer representing the plaintiff rose and stated that his client requested to file an appeal. The judge granted the request and ordered Yan to be released on bail.</p>
<h3>Theater Performance at Minhang Orphanage Causes Disaster</h3>
<p>Collapse of Stage Kills and Injures People</p>
<p>The Minhang Guangci Hospital, which is also an orphanage, hired the entire crew of the Shanghai Tianchan Stage to perform a theatrical performance at the hospital on the afternoon of the day before yesterday to raise funds. A very high stage was built. Ten thousand people came to watch the performance. The performance lasted until 11:00 PM when the stage collapsed due to the large crowd and the lack of sturdy construction. The audience all fell, and people were crushed by people, and were oppressed by wooden boards, etc. More than ten people were injured on the spot, and all were seriously injured. Among them, water policeman Li Xiaolong was crushed on the head and died immediately. The remaining seriously injured were sent to Shanghai Qu Zhiyou Hospital. Yesterday, the County Public Security Bureau reported to the local court, which immediately sent prosecutors to the scene to examine Li Xiaolong's injury to the back of the head and determined that he died as a result of his injuries. They ordered his family to collect the body. It is heard that three more of the injured died yesterday, but the deaths have not been reported to the hospital for verification.</p>
<h3>News from Various Native-Place Associations</h3>
<p>The Huizhou Native-Place Association in Shanghai sent a fast mail telegram stating: The Huizhou-Yang Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong forwarded to various legal entities and the entire citizenry of Huiyang: Upon reading the Yangri telegram, we were shocked to learn that the County Magistrate of Huiyang, in the name of raising government funds, was in fact scheming to collect money by force. Hearing this from afar, we share the same indignation. Huiyang County has suffered repeated wars and countless disasters. There are scars everywhere, and refugees are on the roads. The people are starving, and there are corpses in the fields. As a County Magistrate, one should care about the people's suffering, pacify and gather the laborers, implement conservation policies, and cultivate local vitality. However, he abandons this and puts the cart before the horse, establishing nominal functions and planning to collect a field tax from the county's money and grain items, amounting to as much as three yuan per mu, stripping the last thread from the poor and poisoning the entire county. If the County Council had not opposed it earlier and the Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong had not appealed later, how could the descendants of Huiyang have survived? Collecting field tax is a harmful and oppressive policy, unheard of not only in this province but also rare in the entire country. If the County Magistrate recognizes the overall situation and governs the people, he should practice austerity on the existing government funds, recruit talented people to assist in the affairs, and increase administrative efficiency. If he truly benefits the people and achieves outstanding results, then the people will naturally be willing to contribute. How can he have such a thought of draining the pond to catch all the fish after a situation filled with holes. It is heartbreaking! The members of our association, living in Shanghai, are spiritually connected to Ehuling. We respect and fulfill our obligation and respond to the call. We hope that the gentlemen of the County Council will strictly supervise, and that fellow villagers at home and abroad will rise up to resist, prevent corruption, and benefit our hometown. The telegram is full of sincerity, and we cannot express our utmost wishes. Shanghai Huizhou Native-Place Association bowed to the East,</p>

<h3>Record of the Diamond Sutra Dharma Assembly</h3>
<p>Old Lay Buddhist Jiang Wei-nong of the Shengxin Lianshe at No. 712 Ci Hui Li, the intersection of Seymour Road and Weihaiwei Road, gives lectures on the Diamond Sutra every Tuesday and Friday evening at 7:30 PM. He has been lecturing several times. People come from all directions to listen, and it is quite popular. Jiang Gong is versed in all kinds of learning, and is familiar with hundreds of schools of thought, but returns to the inner classics. He has extensively studied various sects and integrated his mind with Prajna. In this lecture, he can capture the strengths of various theories, integrate them, and use clear words and allegories to open up the meaning of the scriptures. He often says that Prajna clarifies the true emptiness, so as to break the world's greed and attachment, which is truly a good medicine for saving the times. It is no less than a dose of Qingliang powder. But the true emptiness is inseparable from the wonderful existence, and it is by no means a pessimistic withdrawal from the world. And when the truth is clear, the direction is correct. From the body to the use, the cure can be expected. Westerners often come to our country to lecture on Buddhism. How can we not seek to enlighten ourselves? Moreover, the first thing in Buddhism is to understand the truth. If one can understand the principle, then it is easier for those who recite the Buddha to gain strength. Then Prajna Pure Land is really not two things. The audience thinks that Jiang Gong's appearance is stern, his words are eloquent, like counting treasures, deeply manifested, and they are all happy and admiring. And his atmosphere is full, and his learning is deep. Every time he is seen laughing and relaxed after leaving the lecture, he is truly one who can empty his heart and has a deep inner compassion.</p>

<h3>Correspondence</h3>
<p>To the esteemed editor-in-chief of the Shen Bao:</p>
<p>Regarding the article published in the Shen Bao on October 27th concerning the invention of "Maddi Tea" by the Zideng Research Institute, which stated that "drinking tea damages the brain and harms the stomach, causing hair loss and wrinkles," these are all unfounded claims. It should be known that our country's foreign trade relies heavily on silk and tea as major export products, which are vital to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Throughout history, neither Chinese nor foreign scholars have ever argued that Chinese tea is harmful to the human body. The Zideng Research Institute, however, dares to make such arbitrary pronouncements in the newspapers, causing outrage among thousands of tea industry colleagues in Shanghai. Many members of our association originally intended to negotiate directly with the institute, but were persuaded to disperse by our chairman, Wang Yinting, after repeated劝导. We believe that while the institute's invention is welcome news for the nation, it should not boast about itself by attacking others. Therefore, our association has submitted a report to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting an investigation and correction to prevent further propaganda detrimental to domestic products. Otherwise, the institute should be held responsible for any disputes that may arise. We request that this letter be published in the "Correspondence" column to appease public anger. We are deeply grateful.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Shanghai Tea Trade Association</p>
<p>November 5th</p>
<p>To the esteemed editor-in-chief:</p>
<p>I aspire to dedicate myself to the cause of national salvation. However, I was distressed to read a correction notice in the "Correspondence" column of both the Shen Bao and Xin Shen Bao a few days ago (the 2nd) bearing my name, Zhang Jie. It is regrettable that I am a native of Shangyu, Zhejiang, and my name since childhood has been Zhang Jie, and I have never changed it since entering society. This Mr. Zhang Jie is indeed a case of the same name. This is detrimental to my future prospects and related to my association duties, therefore I implore you to grant me a correction and wish the chief writer of Shen Bao good health.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Zhang Jie</p>
<p>November 4th, Special Delivery</p>
<h3>Judge Feetham's Report on the Shanghai International Settlement, Volume 4 (14)</h3>
<p>11. Concerning the remuneration of auditors, it should be determined by the Board of Directors, so that when the two taxpayers' meetings each elect an auditor, the remuneration of the two auditors can be uniform. The Board of Directors should decide and announce the amount of remuneration before holding the election.</p>
<p>B. Security of Tenure</p>
<p>12. Whether auditors should be elected annually or every few years is a question. Auditors should not be changed frequently. Setting a term of several years would help ensure their independence when performing their duties. Therefore, I suggest that the term of auditors should not be less than three years, and it should be stipulated that the annual remuneration during the term should not be different (Note 6).</p>
<p>C. Powers of the Auditors</p>
<p>13. To enable auditors to faithfully perform their duties, they must have the right to obtain all relevant information. The city's regulations sometimes stipulate that if there are violations of the law, expenditures made without prior approval from the Municipal Council, or losses due to negligence or improper actions, the auditors may order the relevant council members or officials to compensate for the losses and may sue the respective members to recover the funds. If such powers are exercised, auditors should also have the power to summon witnesses, administer oaths, and interrogate them in accordance with customary practice. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Quotations from the Nonagenarian Ma Xiangbo</p>
<h3>Shops, Private Schools, Families, and Handicrafts</h3>
<p>— Jing Ji</p>
<p>The old man Xiang recalled... In the past, shops served as private schools, and women in families practiced handicrafts. When the sun set, there were fewer pedestrians on the road and fewer customers at the door, so the shop would close. Every shop offered a supplementary private school. The accountant was the teacher, and the young apprentices were the students. The curriculum involved learning abacus calculations and calligraphy. This was generally the case! Because the accountant was the voluntary teacher of the young apprentices, his position became even more respected when the apprentices became shop assistants! Good shop assistants, knowing gratitude, would naturally not forget the essential commercial knowledge they received from the accountant, thus maintaining considerable respect for their teacher. In this way, wouldn't a shop be harmonious, stable, and able to develop? I wonder what the current customs are like?</p>
<p>I remember in 1904, when I went to Japan, I saw their enthusiasm for supplementary learning. In ordinary schools, during physics and geometry classes, many older people, perhaps the students' fathers or elder brothers, stood in the corridors outside the classroom, listening intently to the teachers who were lecturing and gesturing. This eagerness to learn left a lasting impression on me!</p>
<p>Speaking of families, women used to learn handicrafts. Someone told me that a woman's robe now costs several dollars in labor to have made at a tailor shop! When I heard this, I thought it was right! Why can't they make it themselves? They deserve to complain about the high cost! In the past, the older generation in families, grandmothers who lived to be seventy or eighty years old, still supervised the women in the household to do needlework. Even if the family was well-off, they would still make cotton-padded clothes to give to the poor! Now, the customs are different!</p>
<p>Naturally, the old man Xiang felt a lot of emotion when talking about this!</p>
<h3>Old and New</h3>
<p>— Bi</p>
<p>| Old Brand, New Product |</p>
<p>In this day and age, everything must be new. For example, when it comes to clothing, long robes and jackets are no longer fashionable. Modern friends must wear a Western suit. Just wearing a suit is enough to show that you're modern, but when it comes to the style of the suit, it must be a 1933 model to show that you're modern to the future. Taking one example as a hundred, drawing inferences from one case, if you're not buying anything, then that's it, but if you're buying, you must choose the newest style, otherwise you'll be outdated and not considered a person of the times.</p>
<p>But the situation is often fiercely contradictory. The more you want to buy the newest, most recently manufactured items, the more you insist on going to old stores. For example, if there are two stores selling the same items from the same source, one founded in the first year of the Tongzhi reign (1862) and the other opened in the twenty-first year of the Republic (1932), the store founded in the Tongzhi era will definitely have better business than the one opened in 1932. In the end, it all comes down to the Tongzhi-era store benefiting from the reputation of its brand.</p>
<p>The old Lu Gaojian restaurant in Suzhou and the old Zhengxing Restaurant in the restaurant district are such well-known old brands. The old family physicians who have been Confucian doctors for seven or eight generations, and the old hospitals founded in the Tongzhi era, are often overwhelmed with patients. Whether it's food or goods, if the store's staff says, "This is the oldest of old brands," it will definitely be welcomed. But if a "newest product" is added under the "oldest of old brands," it will definitely be even more popular. Because in this era, only the brand is good for being old. When it comes to goods, the newer, the better.</p>
<p>Our newspaper can be considered the oldest brand in the newspaper industry. No matter what newspaper people in the interior read, they all call it the Shen Bao. From this, one can see the seniority of our newspaper. But the value of being old lies in the brand. The content is selling a "new" product. Although our newspaper is as old as it gets, the content is cutting-edge new. Even this "Free Talk" column, though it's an old brand, its content changes daily.</p>
<h3>A Scene from the Capital War</h3>
<p>— Tianfang</p>
<p>Piles of red packages, green packages, big ones, small ones, sugared chestnuts displayed all over the streets. Gramophones, gongs and drums, the smell of charcoal, deafening calls for sales... As you walk through every alley, you can see a scene from the time-sensitive commercial capital war. Indeed, in this era of great change, everything has lost its constancy. You see "huge discount" advertisements pasted as thickly as bedbugs in summer, so many that they're annoying. The sounds of Western medicine fill the streets, blowing wildly like they've gone mad. People's faces are silent, money is as stagnant as blood, and society is like a sick ox, heading towards decline. Everyone is just waiting, waiting for new life to be born from the collapse.</p>
<h3>The Success of a Deformed Love</h3>
<p>— Ke Dingcang</p>
<p>It's Not a Strange Story</p>
<p>I had already heard my cousin Li Shucheng say that there was a classmate at their school (Hangzhou) who displayed very feminine behavior in his speech and actions, but he always refused to admit that he was a woman.</p>
<p>In Hangzhou, girls are referred to as "Big Green Ladies," so the classmates at XX School gave him this nickname. Whenever he heard this name, he would often twist his neck and pout, showing an ambiguous expression. Doesn't this prove that the classmates' imitation was correct?</p>
<p>Shucheng also said that he shared a room with four classmates who were about the same age. Coincidentally, the one who got along best with him was his fellow villager from Shaoxing. So they were closer to each other, and the two of them would still be talking and laughing with great interest late into the night, after the other two had fallen asleep. One time, one of the other two, seeing them like this every night, pretended to be asleep and secretly observed them. By chance, that very night, he uncovered their secret and clearly learned that he was a physically deformed person. The next day, the news spread by that person like wildfire throughout the school, though no one said anything about it to their faces.</p>
<p>Later, the winter break started, and when school reopened this spring, neither of them came back.</p>
<p>XX XX XX</p>
<p>Recently, Shucheng sent me a letter saying, "The deformed person and his partner that I told you about before actually got married this early summer. Some classmates at school received a photo of the two of them with their offspring a month ago. He looks even more charming, and the offspring is male, looking almost exactly like him. From this, it seems that physically deformed people also have the possibility of marriage."</p>
<h3>Brother Qiu's New Scam</h3>
<p>— Bi Jun</p>
<p>| One of Shanghai's Dark Secrets |</p>
<p>The beautiful Shanghai is full of variety, and nothing is too strange to find. Even scams involve cunning schemes and are constantly evolving. Some people even make this their profession, seizing money, hiding in hotels, indulging in prostitution, and spending lavishly.</p>
<p>Recently, there is a person named Qiu, around twenty-three or four years old, with a dark complexion, a thin body, gold teeth, and wearing the title of leader of the Nanyang Chinese Overseas Asian Walking Group, dressed in Boy Scout uniform or hunting clothes, carrying a donation book and soliciting donations from various companies, stores, foreign firms, and organizations. He claims to have just returned from Yunnan, with a list of local people as proof, and plans to go to Tibet, Qinghai, and India, and has printed stationery for a film crew to explore and take photos everywhere. Listeners often admire his youthful ambition and adventurous walking, so many are generous in donating. This scammer can speak simple English, so Europeans and Americans are also sometimes fooled. After receiving a donation, he asks someone to sign the book as proof. If he meets a domestic goods factory or a business shop that is preparing to sell products to Nanyang landlords but has no way to do so, he uses his eloquent tongue, saying that he can introduce them, and first takes samples as a promotion, etc. Products such as Wudi brand cosmetics, Yixin brand toothbrushes, Chen Jiageng's products, and Shi Dezhi's products are all taken away in large quantities. Once he gets them, he immediately sells them, exchanges them for money, and wanders in major hotels, seeking pleasure and spending his absurd life.</p>
<p>I have encountered several scams of this kind, all the same trick. When talking to relatives and friends, they also said the same thing. One night, I happened to be driving past the Shenzhou Hostel when I suddenly heard a rickshaw puller shouting in pain and arguing over the fare, with the sound of a passenger raising his hand to slap him. The momentum was fierce. Taking a closer look, the passenger was none other than Brother Qiu who was walking. I learned from the rickshaw puller that he had come from the Small Garden. Alas! Such a distance, afraid to trouble your jade feet, I wonder how he walks tens of thousands of miles? It is said that he often takes cars or motorboats, and goes to the Huangpu River with prostitutes to enjoy himself. He spends the whole day leisurely, never leaving the foreign concessions. As for the so-called list of people in Yunnan and other places, if you look closely at the handwriting, most of it is done by one person, and the seals are also mostly counterfeits.</p>
<p>Now, the Northeastern refugees are crying out for help, and the righteous army is fighting desperately against the Japanese. Financial assistance is urgently needed. How can we tolerate this thief swindling people? I sincerely hope that people in society will be vigilant and not make unnecessary sacrifices.</p>

<h3>Crossroads of Death (6)</h3>
<p>— Fan Yanqiao</p>
<p>Soon, Aigu was assimilated by Siyin and guided by Han's young mistress, and she changed bit by bit: first, she changed her clumsy, large, and rough hair into a small, exquisite, and shiny style; second, she shortened the length of her upper garment by two-thirds, reduced her figure by one-fifth, and changed the material from blue cloth to white bamboo cloth. Even her socks and shoes were changed to look different from before, so she looked like an uncut jade that had been polished by a jade worker, suddenly shining brightly, proving that the old saying "clothes make the man" has meaning.</p>
<p>Han's young mistress said to the young master: "Muliang, look at my skills! Aigu has been here for less than a month and has already undergone a transformation."</p>
<p>Muliang said excitedly: "Aigu is born to be a promising talent. If it were any other vulgar girl, no matter how much you dressed her up, it would be useless."</p>
<p>Han's young mistress took out a bottle of snow powder from the drawer of the dressing table and said: "If you let her apply this stuff often, I guarantee she will be even more pleasing."</p>
<p>Muliang laughed and said: "Pleasing to whom?"</p>
<p>Han's young mistress pointed her index finger at Muliang's forehead and said: "Pleasing to you."</p>
<p>Muliang gave a few dry laughs. Han's young mistress casually pressed the electric bell hanging in the air. After a short time, Aigu came in. Muliang carefully looked at her from head to toe again, especially paying attention to her round face, and her full and subtly restrained chest, which was thought-provoking. He then turned his head to look at his wife and felt that his wife no longer had the beauty of a virgin, and he firmly believed that the golden age of a woman was only a period from full development to the eve of marriage. Seeing that Han's young mistress had given her the snow powder, she took it, smiled sweetly, and bashfully said a word, inadvertently pouring her eyes on Muliang. Muliang's eyes had not moved for a long time, and they met. Aigu could no longer calm down, turned around and left, lowered her head, probably her cheeks were flushed with red clouds. Muliang said with emotion: "If she is further enlightened by you and bathed in the fragrance of Paris, I am afraid she will be a 'queen of maids'."</p>
<p>Han's young mistress was naturally very proud when she heard this, and after a while, she said in a low voice: "I'm afraid you'll be enchanted."</p>
<p>Muliang still gave a few dry laughs. After a long time without speaking, he turned on the gramophone and listened to a few records of folk tunes, and this evening passed.</p>

<h3>Gold Standard Slightly Declines</h3>
<p>Without Major Twists and Turns Yesterday, the market was slightly lower, but the trend was still good, without any major twists and turns. From morning to noon, the difference was only four and a half taels. The opening was low, but the long-term continued to rise, and the silver price was close to a large increase, which was also affected by the strong European market. Although the exchange rate was quoted half a cent higher, the domestic market was not loose, and the bank's appetite was still strong. Therefore, the various firms hedged and sold US dollars, and then recovered the strips. It was also rumored that the Central Bank continued to purchase spot goods, so the market price rose from low to high. However, the Guangbang suddenly and aggressively sold one thousand several hundred bars. Fortunately, the exchange rate was stable, so the gold price did not fall too much. In the end, it stood at seven hundred and forty-five taels. Compared with yesterday, it only fell back two taels. It is reported that Taikang Run sold 210 bars of cash to the Central Bank at a price of 44 taels and 5 qian. It is also rumored that 420 bars were traded. The market will be closed on Saturday, and the situation this week is complicated. It was originally intended to be a deficit, but since the beginning of the week, it has seen 759 taels and 1 qian, and then the situation has been unpredictable. In short, the foreign news is divergent, and the silver market is very different from the local exchange rate. By the end of the week, the price fell to 742 taels, which is 7.5 taels lower than last Saturday. The difference between high and low in these six days is 17.1 taels. The situation of yesterday's market is recorded below.</p>
<p>Slightly Down 1.9 Taels The opening price for December morning was 743.5 taels, a drop of 3.3 taels. (Before the opening, the black market was shouting around 5 or 6 taels to 4 taels). Then it was learned that the private electricity silver price had not increased or decreased, and the US cotton had already increased by more than ten pounds. There were several qian up and down, but Hengyu, Qianchangxiang, Daxingyong and Dalianbang came to add about one tael, for 44 taels and 4 qian. Then Yuan Mao Yong, Zhi Feng Yong, Hong Kang Yong, Bing Xing, Heng Yu, etc. sold out, and HSBC sold 11,000 American dollars in November, and the bank's buying price in January was 0625, so the price immediately dropped by more than two taels. Dadecheng also sold off, and at 9:10 it was 42 taels. Soon after, Huabi absorbed 9,375 American dollars in December and 30 yuan in January. Qianchangxiang, Yuanheng, Yuankang, Xiangzhaofeng, Changyuantai, etc. bought in, and it was rumored that the Central Bank opened to buy 105 bars of spot goods, so it returned more than two taels. At 9:30, it was 4 taels and a half. At this time, Hengxing came out and entered again, but not many. HSBC listed the exchange rates for both England and the United States, each increasing by 1.25, but the domestic market was not strong, so the market price could still stand. Then, a small number of retailers on the table sold out, and then fell to 3 taels and 6 qian. Since then, the exchange rates of various firms have been erratic, and the price has also fluctuated by one tael. Until after 10 o'clock, it was at 44 taels, 3 and 4 qian. It was heard that the Central Bank had absorbed 105 bars of spot goods again, and Qianchangxiang, Yingfeng, Hengfu, Yu, Hengyu, Yuanheng, Dadecheng, etc. came to compete for purchase, and because the US dollar bank's appetite was strong, December 9375, February 125, January 30 yuan, so at 11 o'clock, it was 5 taels and 5 qian. Not long after, Tongtai, Changfu, Taiheng, Yifeng, Yongyuan, Maoyong, etc. sold out, falling to 4 taels and 6 qian. Soon after, Dadecheng worked hard to drag in, and Daxingyong, Hengyu, Dafengyong and Hedging also competed to buy. It was also rumored that the Central Bank traded 420 bars of spot goods with US dollars, so the price was raised by two taels. After 11 o'clock, it was 46 taels and a half. In an instant, Yifeng, Hengxing, etc. went to the market and sold 5 or 6 hundred bars, losing one tael immediately. Soon after, it added 4 or 5 qian, because the entrants were not silent, but Zhifengyong Hengyu also sold, and Hengxing sold continuously, so at 11:50, it was 4 taels and 7 qian. However, the Bank of America in December continued to absorb a total of 875, which should be pulled to 5 taels and 6 qian. By noon, it was 44 taels and 9 qian, and it continued to rise to 46 taels, so the goods were raised by 6 qian, a drop of 1.9 taels compared to the day before (according to the posted price). According to half a day, the maximum was 6 taels and a half, the minimum was 2 taels, and the fluctuation was 4 taels and a half. The bare bars added 11 taels.</p>
<p>The Revealed Price is Slightly Suppressed by One Taels The revealed price was 814 taels with US dollars up 1.25, which is about 70 taels, 678 taels at noon, and 69 taels at the end, one tael less than the previous day. The account was 47 taels to 45 taels, and the water supplement was 46 taels.</p>

<h3>Securities and Bond Market Increasingly Desolate</h3>
<p>|Price Slightly Declining, Trend Increasingly Stagnant|</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 5th), the situation in various bond markets at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange showed that several markets were still opening. Total transactions amounted to 22,300 yuan, including over 6,000 yuan each for the Reorganization Bonds of 19 and the Salt Tax bonds. Other transactions were minimal. The futures market was even more desolate, with sluggish trading throughout the day and sparse activity between various boards. Many monthly futures contracts did not open fully. It is estimated that total transactions in the morning and afternoon markets were only about 900,000 yuan, totaling 1,790,000 yuan. This included 300,000 to 400,000 yuan each for the Unified Salt Tax bonds and Reorganization Bonds, 170,000 to 180,000 yuan for the Customs Bonds of 20, and only several tens of thousands of yuan for others. The market sentiment was one of cautious observation, and the bond market atmosphere was extremely dull. Large investors remained inactive, and even small investors were less active than before. As a result, the trend became increasingly stagnant, with morning and afternoon markets still hovering around 10 to 20 cents, a slight decline compared to the previous day, amounting to about 20 cents. The market situation has returned to a state of quiescence.</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Soars</h3>
<p>A report from the New Feng Foreign Firm stated that on Friday (the 4th), the New York Stock Exchange saw very firm prices for various stocks. This was due to Chicago wheat rising by two cents and grain prices soaring. Bonds also turned from weak to strong, and sentiment was good, leading to significant gains. Union Carbide rose by four dollars, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph by three dollars and 87.5 cents, and Union Pacific Railroad by two dollars and 25 cents. The total volume of trading for the day was one million shares. It was observed that the support line had not been broken, so there might be a significant rebound after the election next week. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price    Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks    61.53    Up 2.25</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks    26.45    Up 1.75</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn Market Rebound After a Sharp Drop</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market, after a sharp drop, saw some profit-takers covering their short positions, and American cotton also rebounded. This led to a shift in sentiment and a slight increase in market prices, but the overall situation remained weak due to the difficulty in easing credit. Major investors were still keen on short selling. There was occasional procurement of local yarn, but the future situation lacked certainty. Apart from a certain country's yarn rising by 11 yuan,</p>
<p>There are Scattered Short Coverings in Manbiao. The opening of the Manbiao market was slightly tight due to the rebound in cotton prices, leading to short coverings. Each month rose by 5, 6, and 8 cents. The afternoon opening was still flat, and the two or three boards were slightly firm, with each month rising again by 1, 2, 4, and 5 cents. The total volume of transactions for the day was 26,500 bales. It was noted that Gengfeng sold 1,200 bales, Renfeng 850 bales, Dachang 920 bales, and Tongfeng 1,400 bales.

<h3>Sudden Rally in the Cotton Market</h3>
<p>The cotton market suddenly rallied, as profit-takers took the opportunity to cover their short positions after a sharp drop. At the same time, American cotton also trended upward, further tightening market conditions. However, major sellers remained unusually calm and maintained their intention to sell on any rallies. The demand for spot cotton in the market remained sluggish, but a certain country's cotton prices soared by 23 yuan. The future of the cotton market still depends on the movements of American cotton.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao's Profitable Bulls Covering Short Positions   The opening of the Zheng Biao market saw scattered retail short coverings due to the rise in American cotton prices, with each month rebounding by 3-4 cents. The afternoon opening was flat, with the two or three boards rising again by 0.5-1 cent. The total volume of transactions for the day was 69,500 dan. It was noted that Mingde sold 2,500 dan, Rongxing 2,600 dan, Xiesheng 2,100 dan, Renfeng 1,900 dan, and Yifeng 1,300 dan. Shenji bought 2,500 dan, Changfeng 2,800 dan, Changhe 2,300 dan, and Gengfeng 2,000 dan. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>Demand for Raw Cotton is Very Quiet   The demand for spot cotton is quite quiet, and the supply is also limited. It is estimated that there were 731 bales of Yao cotton and 1,200 bales of Tong cotton.</p>
<p>Beixinjing 28.50, Shenxin Factory purchased 500 bales for delivery to the factory.</p>
<h3>Active Buying of American Cotton</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton saw active buying due to strong short covering by Wall Street investors, and the market situation was firm and lively. Futures rose by 13-17 points, and spot prices rose by 10 points. British cotton futures rose by 6-7 points, while spot prices fell by 3 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 2 points. Indian cotton market was closed. The original telegram is recorded on the left (4th Telegram): American Cotton, Compared to Previous Day, Equivalent Shanghai Standard, British Cotton, Compared to Previous Day, Equivalent Shanghai Standard</p>

<h3>Private Estimates of American Cotton All Increased</h3>
<p>A New York telegram on the 4th reported that the Foxdick Bureau's estimate for the current season's new cotton production is 11,175,000 bales, an increase of 336,000 bales compared to the previous estimate (October 5th). The amount of cotton ginned is 8,700,000 bales. The average estimate from brokers on the New York Cotton Exchange is 11,410,000 bales, an increase of 425,000 bales compared to the previous estimate.</p>
<h3>Hedging Sales of American Cotton Decreased Last Week</h3>
<p>A New York telegram on the 4th reported on the cotton market situation for the week, stating that the industry demand in the raw cotton market this week, including domestic and foreign countries such as Japan, seemed sufficient to absorb all daily hedging sales. However, buying interest was limited to lower prices, and market prices were slightly lower. Political instability restricted general trade, and there was a clear trend of waiting to see how things would develop. There were some arbitrage activities between New York and Liverpool due to changes in the British pound exchange rate. Liverpool may have bought in slightly in anticipation of greater optimism in Manchester and hopes for an early resolution to the Lancashire cotton industry labor dispute. The average of the initial four private reports on cotton-producing areas at the end of October was 11,539,000 bales, compared to the average estimate of 11,279,000 bales at the same time last month. Spot cotton basis prices were stable, and there were relatively few sales in the interior.</p>

<h3>Dramatic Fluctuations in the Grain and Flour Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the close of the flour market in the morning, there were significant changes in the prices of various months. At the initial opening, the price of foreign wheat rebounded by about 30-40 cents, and a certain factory also raised its price accordingly. Therefore, after the opening of the auction, the price rebounded by 2-3 cents compared to the previous day. However, after the second board, both Fufu and Fulong factories dumped their products, and the offering of Australian wheat continued unabated. Transactions could be made at any time from 3.55 taels to 3.5 taels. The market atmosphere was like a boat without a rudder, subject to blows. After that, the price fell sharply step by step, falling by 2-4 cents compared to the opening price. When the afternoon market opened, the situation was even worse than in the morning. Because most of the bulls could no longer hold on due to fundamental reasons, they all cut their losses. The severity of the situation was the first time since the establishment of the exchange. For example, December fell to a low of 1.685 taels, January to 1.66 taels, February to 1.665 taels, March to 1.68 taels, and April to 1.69 taels, all new record lows. It was then rumored that major players in the cotton yarn industry were buying in, intending to raise prices, and there was a gradual rebound. After the fourth board, transactions became clearer, and the situation stabilized. As for the oversupply of global agricultural products, if producers forcibly raise spot prices and prevent widespread circulation, they will almost isolate themselves. As a result, the current month was better by 1.75 cents compared to the previous day, December was slightly better by 5 cents, January by 2.5 cents, February by 5 cents, and March and April by 7.5 cents.</p>
<h3>Wheat Prices: Futures Down, Spot Flat</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning and afternoon, there were signs of weakness in the prices of various months. Although the price of foreign wheat was better by 20-40 cents, the external environment remained unfavorable. Furthermore, in the near future, the oversupply of foreign countries will shift to China. This situation will inevitably play out under the unrestricted flow of foreign wheat. Therefore, people were panicked. Although transactions were not smooth, the market unanimously declined. If foreign wheat continues to be priced low, the market is likely to weaken further. As a result, the current month and December each fell by 3 cents, January and February fell by 5 cents, March fell by 4 cents, and April remained unchanged. The spot wheat market slightly improved, and the opening price turned flat. The opening prices were 3.25 taels for Gaoyou wheat, 3.32 taels for Yaowan wheat, and 3.26 taels for Saiying wheat, with a total of over 400 dan.</p>
<h3>Chicago Wheat Rebounds Firmly</h3>
<p>A report from the New Feng Foreign Firm stated that on Friday (the 4th), Chicago wheat rose by 1.375 cents for each term due to the strength of the New York stock market and short covering. Also, the total transaction volume on the 3rd was 30 million bushels. The firm listed the market prices of the 4th below:</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>December 43.625 Up 1.375</p>
<p>May 47.250 Up 1.375</p>
<p>July 49.875 Up 1.375</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Factories Sent Over 200 Bales Via Telegram</h3>
<p>The silk market in this port, managed by foreign firms, has seen limited telegram transactions due to the unusually low silk prices overseas. Silk sales have been sluggish for a long time. Yesterday, due to the stabilization of the exchange rate, European and American firms discussed sending telegrams to Chinese silk merchants. However, the price of Grade B silk fell by another 40-50 taels, with the price only reaching 470-480 taels. Ganlida, Dachang, and others sent out silk telegrams for over 200 bales in total. It is necessary to wait for the telegrams of Monday and Tuesday next week for a firm grasp on the actual sales. Yesterday, only Xinfu imported 18 bales of Sichuan yellow factory silk, and Zhonghe imported 30 bales of eight-cocoon gray silk.</p>
<h3>Popularity of Hand-Picked Chunmee Green Tea Sales Continues in France</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market in this port, managed by foreign firms, continued to see strong sales of hand-picked Chunmee green tea from various sources. British firms such as Jinlong and Tianxiang were searching and buying with all their might due to demand from Morocco. The market prices were also slightly firmer than before. The Russian Cooperative Society still did not open for Gongxi green tea. However, Yulong Foreign Firm from Baitou continued to show strong interest. In addition, French firms also bought some of the needle, phoenix, and excellent quality grades from large merchants. However, no one asked about Keemun black tea.</p>
<h3>Coal: Fuzhou Coal Dust Subject to Additional Tax</h3>
<p>Since the puppet state occupied the Northeast Customs, all goods coming from the Northeast must pay import duties. Since Fuzhou coal dust is produced in Fengtian, the Ministry of Finance has ordered the Customs to also levy taxes according to regulations. Yesterday, a certain company in this port shipped 1,500 tons of new goods, which have already been taxed. However, the cost has increased as a result. Yesterday, when the market opened, the price was raised by 5 cents per ton.</p>
<h3>The Sugar Market's Coarse Granulated White Sugar Sees Stagnant Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a very weak trend due to the repeated decline in bidding prices. The quoted price for No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar remained at 14.9 taels, and the price for machine-ground fine granulated white sugar was also 14.9 taels, but there were no transactions, resulting in a stagnant situation. The prices for No. 20 and No. 18 medium granulated white sugar and No. 8, 9, and 10 Dutch red sugar also remained unchanged. Yesterday, 130 bags of locally produced Grade 2 white sugar, which were transported by the Taikoo Company's Jinan ship, were fully released by the Jianbang firm at a price of 13.8 taels. It is said that the buyer's desired price is above 14 taels, but it is difficult to achieve because of the competition from the local factory's products in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Longkou Vermicelli Market Prices Are Inverted</h3>
<p>|Sluggish Sales in Shanghai|</p>
<p>Recently, the sales of Longkou vermicelli have been sluggish, and the market prices have fallen by 2-3 cents. There have been no deliveries of goods. The previous price was less than 19 taels, and now various dealers are reluctant to buy. Therefore, there have been no transactions between the dealers and customers. It is especially difficult to make a profit because the local price is higher than the price in Shanghai. The future market must wait for the sales to become active before there is any hope of improvement. Yesterday, the top brand Long vermicelli was sold at 19 taels, and Yantai vermicelli at 16.5 taels. The market situation is weak.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: White Tung Oil Market at the Time of Old and New Transition</h3>
<p>The new white tung oil season has arrived, but foreign firms are still showing a cautious approach. There are rumors about the arrival of Xianggu tung oil in Wuhan, causing the Wuhan market to linger in a state of fluctuation. It can be said with certainty that the market cannot develop and can only maintain the current situation. However, the factories in various producing areas in Zhejiang are urgently engaged in the work of starting to manufacture new goods, and the market is filled with an atmosphere of hoping for lower prices. According to investigations, the purchase price of tung seeds in various producing areas means that the cost of Shanghai combined is slightly above 22 taels per dan. Therefore, a Hangzhou dealer opened sales in Shanghai a few days ago, selling 600-700 dan of futures oil for December delivery at prices between 23.46 yuan, while the spot price was 24.24 yuan. According to reports from those familiar with the conditions in the producing areas, the price of the futures sales was already low. If the price falls further, the cost concerns in the producing areas may prevent it. Local firms in this port, because they are aware that the sales market is not very active, are not being too greedy. However, they seem to be slightly cheaper than Wuhan tung oil. Therefore, future purchases should focus on Zhejiang tung oil.</p>
<h3>Metals: Over 3,000 Dan Opened Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the metal market situation saw both activity and quietness. There were significant transactions in English steel plates, new foreign silver dollars, tinplate, and new lead wire. It is said that the total number of transactions reached over 3,000 dan, causing the prices in various markets to rise sharply. English steel plates were priced at 8.25 taels per dan for 0.02-inch thickness, 6 taels for 0.05-inch thickness, and 5.75 taels for 0.075-inch thickness, all rising step by step compared to the previous market prices. Those who were slower to procure were all sighing with regret. It was found that the most active buyers were from Qingdao, Tianjin, and the Yangtze River areas. Apart from these, others did not inquire. As for other varieties, such as copper, tin, bronze, angle iron, railway skin, and new iron wire, they were all stagnant and motionless. Therefore, the future of the market is inevitably bleak.</p>
<h3>Ribbed Steel Bars Increase in Price by One Tael</h3>
<p>Recently, the price of ribbed steel bars has increased due to the limited supply in the market and a sharp increase in exports. It is estimated that the price for all varieties is 67 taels per ton, an increase of one tael compared to the previous price. There is also a growing short interest in the market, so the future price trend is expected to rise further.</p>

<p>Speech</p>
<h3>Knowing What's What</h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>The night is late and people are quiet. Suddenly, in a deep alley, a narrow road, you hear the words, "Know what's what." There is not one person who isn't dumbfounded, their hair standing on end. Those who know what's what will take out the Yuan heads (money) and other items they have on them and offer them up with both hands. If you don't know what's what, you'll be made to regret it.</p>
<p>The words "knowing what's what" mean "to act according to circumstances" or "to read the wind." Observing the popularity of this term, one can understand the greatness of its effect. My friend Zhao Tagong has said, "When walking, pay attention to traffic lights; when living, learn from so-and-so." This is the meaning of knowing what's what. If something can be done, do it. If something cannot be done, don't do it—this is knowing what's what. If someone can be befriended, befriend them. If someone cannot be befriended, don't befriend them—this is knowing what's what. If someone can be talked to, talk to them. If someone cannot be talked to, don't talk to them—this too is knowing what's what.</p>
<p>When Group A gains power, I immediately turn around and align myself with Group A—this is knowing what's what. When Person B gains power, I immediately change my face and befriend Person B—this too is knowing what's what. The two words "knowing" seem easy, but are actually very difficult. If you do it improperly, knowing what's what will turn into not knowing what's what. The 19th Route Army's 5th Army resisting the violent Japanese seems like not knowing what's what, but because it's what the people desire, it is knowing what's what. The northern generals completely not resisting seems like knowing what's what, but because they are abandoned by the people, it is not knowing what's what.</p>
<p>I will further illustrate with two historical examples.</p>
<p>During the Warring States period, after Lord Mengchang was deposed, all his guests left. Later, he summoned them again. Lord Mengchang sighed and said, "I always treated my guests well, and never dared to neglect them. Now, seeing me deposed, they all turned their backs on me. If they were to see me again, they would surely spit in my face." This is an example of guests knowing and not knowing what's what.</p>
<p>Also, Wang Bo was orphaned and poor when he was young. He once stayed at the Magnolia Temple in Yangzhou and ate with the monks. The monks grew tired of him, so they would ring the bell after the meal was finished. Wang Bo would arrive only after they had already eaten. Twenty years later, Wang Bo was stationed in the same area. When he went to inscribe characters, he saw that the inscription was covered with a green gauze curtain. Wang Bo wrote a poem: "The sermon is over, and everyone has gone their separate ways. I am ashamed of the monk's bell after the meal. For twenty years, dust has covered my face. Only now do I have this green gauze covering." This too is an example of the monks knowing and not knowing what's what.</p>
<p>Hence the ancient saying, "Kissing the horse's rear instead of its head." Lord Mengchang's guests may have thought they knew what's what, but in the end, they did not. The monks were the most knowledgeable, but sometimes they too made mistakes. It's evident that knowing what's what is no easy matter. If one can know what's what in all places and in all matters, then one is truly talented.</p>

<h3>Gazing South at the Elms and Descendants</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>Dance academies rise in droves on the sea coast, all imitating foreign customs. A friend invited me to watch a dance, but I declined due to illness. To describe its nature, I compose this song. Alas, the entire nation is frenzied. With such a celestial demon singing across the river, why must a merchant's daughter's lament come from within? How can it be stopped?</p>
<p>Celestial demon dance, tapping rhythmically as if in response, drunk butterflies flying together in embraces, a startling goose step, each glance captivating, dissolving all sorrows of past and present,</p>

<h3>Several Types of Cosmetics</h3>
<p>— Shen Erming</p>
<p>The following are several types of cosmetics, excerpted from the *Universal Library*. Considering the large readership of this publication, they are introduced below for general knowledge.</p>
<p>Face Powder</p>
<p>The main raw material for face powder used to be lead carbonate. However, lead carbonate is poisonous, and prolonged use will inevitably make the complexion ashen and bloodless. Therefore, zinc white (i.e., zinc oxide) is now mostly used instead. The following two types are both top-grade white powders:</p>
<p>㈠ Five hundred cubic centimeters of zinc oxide, three kilograms of precipitated calcium carbonate, five hundred cubic centimeters of talcum powder, one kilogram of starch, thirty cubic centimeters of jasmine essence, thirty cubic centimeters of rose essence, thirty cubic centimeters of orange blossom essence, and 7.5 cubic centimeters of musk essence. Grind the above four types of powder until extremely fine, sieve through a very fine sieve, and then mix. Slowly drip in the essences, adding and stirring simultaneously, not too quickly.</p>
<p>㈡ Seven hundred cubic centimeters of wheat starch, five hundred cubic centimeters of zinc oxide, four hundred cubic centimeters of talcum essence, ten cubic centimeters of sweet-osmanthus essence, and five cubic centimeters of rose essence. First, grind the powder finely, sieve, and mix, then add the fragrances.</p>
<p>Rouge</p>
<p>Rose Rouge Solution: Thirty-five cubic centimeters of fuchsine, sixty cubic centimeters of ammonium chloride solution, seventy cubic centimeters of rose essence, and two liters of rose water. First, grind the fuchsine into small pieces, put it in a bottle, add ammonium chloride solution, and shake repeatedly. After leaving it for several days, add rose essence and rose water, and shake even more. After eight days, take the clear liquid from the top, and you're done.</p>
<p>Rouge Paste: Thirty cubic centimeters of fuchsine, fifty cubic centimeters of powdered gum arabic, six hundred cubic centimeters of talcum powder, or an appropriate amount of rose oil. Place the above ingredients in a bowl, mix, and grind them. Add a small amount of water and mix into a thick paste.</p>
<p>Emulsion</p>
<p>Ordinary emulsion is a white liquid that does not contain free alkali. When used to wipe the face, it can make the skin clean, white, soft, and smooth, which is superior to pancreatic soap.</p>
<p>Glycerin Emulsion: Two hundred and fifty cubic centimeters of glycerin, four hundred cubic centimeters of almond oil, one hundred cubic centimeters of spermaceti, thirty-two cubic centimeters of beeswax (double the amount in summer), three hundred and fifty cubic centimeters of rose water, and four cubic centimeters of rose oil. Melt the beeswax and spermaceti in a porcelain dish, slowly add almond oil and rose water containing glycerin, and then add rose oil.</p>
<p>Freckle Emulsion: Fifty cubic centimeters of camphor, twenty cubic centimeters of ammonium oxide, ten cubic centimeters of mercuric chloride, one hundred cubic centimeters of egg white, and one kilogram of rose water. First, dissolve the camphor in a small amount of alcohol, then dissolve the ammonium oxide, mercuric chloride, and egg white separately in water. Slowly mix and stir, resulting in a white precipitate or emulsion. This is quite effective in treating freckles, but it is poisonous and should not be ingested.</p>
<p>Depilatory</p>
<p>Depilatories are medicines used to remove beards, chest hair, etc. They are generally sulfides of calcium, barium, etc. The effectiveness of old depilatories decreases, so newly prepared ones must be used. Depilatories can damage the skin, so caution should be exercised when using them.</p>
<p>㈠ Three cubic centimeters of barium sulfide, one cubic centimeter of starch, and an appropriate amount of water. Mix into a paste, apply to the skin, and wash off with water after the hair falls out.</p>
<p>㈡ Twelve cubic centimeters of alcohol, thirty-five cubic centimeters of collodion, 0.7 cubic centimeters of iodine, 1.5 cubic centimeters of turpentine, and two cubic centimeters of castor oil. Mix and apply thickly to the skin. ㈢ Eight cubic centimeters of quicklime powder, one cubic centimeter of carbonic acid , and one cubic centimeter of potassium sulfide. Mix with an appropriate amount of water and apply.</p>
<p>Hair Dye</p>
<p>Lead Acetate Hair Dye Solution: Three cubic centimeters of lead acetate, twelve cubic centimeters of sodium thiosulfate, thirty cubic centimeters of glycerin, thirty cubic centimeters of pure alcohol, and four hundred cubic centimeters of distilled water. First, dissolve the lead acetate and sodium thiosulfate separately in a small amount of water. Then, add the sodium thiosulfate solution to the mixture of alcohol, glycerin, and water, stirring constantly. Next, pour in the lead acetate solution. Store in a blue bottle. After one day, take the clear liquid and brush it on the hair once a day to gradually turn it black. However, it should not be used frequently, as lead is poisonous.</p>
<p>Gold Hair Solution: This is a nitrogen dioxide solution, which has bleaching power and can bleach hair into a golden yellow color. When using it for the first time, use a diluted solution and first wash the hair with pancreatic soap water. Then, wash off the pancreatic soap with clean water before applying it.</p>
<p>Potassium Permanganate Solution: One hundred and fifty cubic centimeters of potassium permanganate and two liters of distilled water. This is a brown hair dye and can also be used to dye the beard.</p>
<p>Hand Products</p>
<p>Hand cosmetics are used to apply to the hands to make the skin white and to polish the nails to make them smooth.</p>
<p>Hand Cream: Thirty cubic centimeters of hydrous lanolin, twenty cubic centimeters of glycerin, ten cubic centimeters of borax, two cubic centimeters of Yu Shu Shen Oil, and one cubic centimeter of bitter almond oil. Mix the above ingredients thoroughly and apply to the hands.</p>
<p>Nail Polishing Powder: One hundred cubic centimeters of zinc oxide, one hundred cubic centimeters of talcum powder, fifty cubic centimeters of starch, one cubic centimeter of fuchsine, two kilograms of finely powdered stannic oxide, ten cubic centimeters of bergamot oil, ten cubic centimeters of lavender oil, and twenty cubic centimeters of fuchsine. Mix.</p>
<p>Nail Polish: Two cubic centimeters of paraffin wax and sixty cubic centimeters of petroleum ether. Dissolve the paraffin wax in petroleum ether, then dye it peach-red with alkanet root. When using, dip a brush in it and apply it to the nails.</p>
<h3>Parents, Stop Arguing</h3>
<p>Society Improvement Discussion Group</p>
<h3>Conclusions on Improving Family Problems</h3>
<p>— Cimin</p>
<p>Although Messrs. Yun Zong, Ming Xing, Zhuo Yun, and Wen Bing have successively expressed their opinions in this publication regarding the issue of improving the family, their arguments have only considered one aspect of the problem, failing to take the whole into account. As a result, the issue has been delayed until now without a proper solution, which is truly regrettable.</p>
<p>Within their respective arguments, all premised on a shared agreement regarding the inadequacy of the family system, we can clearly discern two divergent tendencies:</p>
<p>1. The family is a constituent element of society, and the corruption of society is rooted in the inadequacy of the family system. Therefore, improving the family is the initial step in improving society. This "small to large" argument is advocated by Messrs. Yun Zong and Zhuo Yun.</p>
<p>2. The family cannot exist independently of the social system. The inadequacy of the family system stems from the inadequacy of the social, economic, and political systems. Therefore, improving the family requires first improving the organization of society's politics and economy. This "large to small" argument is advocated by Messrs. Ming Xing and Wen Bing.</p>
<p>The first viewpoint only grasps the point that an inadequate family system can exert a negative influence on society, completely ignoring the social foundation that produces this family system. The second viewpoint, on the other hand, does the reverse, only explaining the social organization from which an inadequate family system arises, completely erasing the point that the inadequate family system exerts a negative influence on society.</p>
<p>That is why I say that they have only seen one aspect of the problem, failing to take the whole into account. I believe that the establishment of a family system is entirely dependent on the social organization. For example, a feudal social organization produces a large family system of clustered clans, and a capitalist social organization produces a small family system of monogamous couples. The current "neither fish nor fowl" social organization in our country has given rise to a mix of small families and large families. . . [illegible text] . . . It is definitely not what Yun Zong and Zhuo Yun advocate. However, although the production of the family system depends on the lower-level social organization, once the family system is established, it inevitably can and does exert many influences on the social, political, and economic systems from which it originates. There are already many such examples. It is also inappropriate that Messrs. Wen Bing dismiss this lightly.</p>
<p>Here, I list the mutual relationship between the two as follows:</p>
<p>Upper Level: Family System | Lower Level: Social Organization</p>
<p>Therefore, if we want to thoroughly improve the family, we must wait for the improvement of the social organization. In the process of improving the social organization, we cannot get rid of the influence given by the family.</p>
<p>This is my humble opinion. I hope the editor and readers will further instruct me!</p>
<p>Short Story</p>
<h3>The Harm of Gambling</h3>
<p>— Yixin</p>
<p>A Scene of Sorrow in a Telephone</p>
<p>Characters:</p>
<p>The Eldest Brother (Suicide Attempt - Not on Stage), The Second Brother, The Third Brother, The Third Brother's Wife</p>
<p>Object: Telephone</p>
<p>Location: This City</p>
<p>Time: 4:00 AM</p>
<p>Scene opens with the Third Brother and his wife sound asleep in bed. The Second Brother calls.</p>
<p>(Telephone) Ring... ring... ring...</p>
<p>(The Third Brother's Wife) The ringing sound reaches her ears, and she wakes up, saying: "Who would be calling at this hour?" (Calling her husband) "Hey, the phone's ringing! Get up and answer it quickly!"</p>
<p>(The Third Brother) Woken up by his wife, also hears the ringing of the telephone. He gets up in a fluster, saying resentfully: "Who's calling at this ungodly hour?" He shuffles out in his slippers to answer it. "Hello, hello, who is this?"</p>
<p>(The Second Brother) "Hello, is this the Third Brother? It's me, the Second Brother."</p>
<p>(The Third Brother) "Yes, it's me. Is that you, Second Brother? Hello, hello, what's the matter that you're calling at this hour?"</p>
<p>(The Second Brother) "Hello, hello, I'm calling to tell you that the Eldest Brother died last night. Please come over quickly."</p>
<p>(The Third Brother) "The Eldest Brother is dead? Hello, hello, what disease did he have? How could he die so quickly?"</p>
<p>(The Second Brother) "Hello, he didn't have any disease. He committed suicide by taking poison."</p>
<p>(The Third Brother) "Ah! What kind of stimulation did he suffer that he committed suicide?"</p>
<p>(The Second Brother) "Hello, around a little past one o'clock last night, I was sound asleep when someone from his house came to call me. I asked him why he was calling me? He said: 'The Eldest Brother has taken poison.' He was already suffering from the poison and told me to quickly come and find a way. When I heard that, I braved the chilling wind and immediately ran to his house. He was in bed shouting in pain, 'It hurts so much! It hurts so much!' I asked him, 'Big Brother, why did you do this?' I asked him several times. He opened his eyes and looked at me a few times, tears streaming down his face, and said to me: 'Ah! Second Brother, I can't go on living.' After saying that, he stopped talking. I asked him repeatedly again. He said: 'I lost several thousand dollars in the XX gambling company. This several thousand dollars was still from the shop's promissory notes. I privately issued a promissory note ... [illegible text] ...I was momentarily confused, now it's too late... After thinking it over and over, suicide is easier. After I die, please arrange for you and the Third Brother to take care of those children and look after them.' As he spoke, his voice grew softer and softer, and it was hard to hear clearly. At that moment, I forgot about the question of saving him, and quickly called a rickshaw and sent him to the hospital. After the doctor gave him a stomach pumping, I asked the doctor if there was any hope of saving him from the poison. The doctor said that he had taken too much poison and that it would be difficult to save him. Sure enough, before three hours had passed, he shouted 'Ah!' and died. Hello, hello, come over quickly!"</p>
<p>(Telephone) Cuts off.</p>
<p>(The Third Brother) "Ah! Ah! Big Brother, I repeatedly told you not to gamble, but you gambled more and more. Now you've abandoned us like this, how can I not be heartbroken?"</p>
<p>(The Third Brother's Wife) "Hey, who was calling on the phone for so long?" (The Third Brother) "The Second Brother called to tell me that the Eldest Brother died."</p>
<p>(The Third Brother's Wife) "Ah, I ran into him on the street a couple of days ago, and he even greeted me with a smile. Why would he die for no reason? What disease did he die from?"</p>
<p>(The Third Brother) "Ah, he committed suicide because he lost several thousand dollars gambling. Isn't it pitiful that he died so tragically?"</p>
<p>(The Third Brother's Wife) "Gambling is the most terrible thing. Losing money goes without saying, but he even lost his life. I've always told you, no matter what kind of gambling, you can't gamble. Small gambling wastes time, large gambling leads to ruin. Now it's clear. He's telling you to go quickly, why are you still standing there dumbly?"</p>
<p>(The Third Brother) Hearing his wife's words, he hurriedly put on his clothes and went out.</p>
<p>Valuing Clothes Over People</p>
<h3>A Silk Pongee Robe</h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>Recently, I made myself a silk pongee robe. Because in this society where "clothes are valued over people," I believe that a valuable garment can be of great help to me.</p>
<p>Because of my poor clothing, I have been ridiculed by many people. Once, when I went to the XX Hall on business, I boldly entered the elevator and said to the operator:</p>
<p>"Third floor."</p>
<p>But the operator looked me up and down and said angrily:</p>
<p>"What? You want to take the elevator to the third floor? Go to the fifth floor!"</p>
<p>Under this shout, I went all the way up to the fifth floor. Without saying a word, I had to walk down step by step from the fifth floor. Alas! After all, I don't have a generous mind. I sighed deeply.</p>
<p>From then on, I worked hard to save a few dollars and actually bought a piece of silk pongee material worth twelve dollars. Coming back from the main street, I felt extremely happy. I thought: "Now I can get rich." At dinner, my wife asked me:</p>
<p>"Then what material will we use for the lining?"</p>
<p>"Ah! That's right, it still needs a lining." I suddenly realized.</p>
<p>But where would the money come from? This really made things difficult for me. So I had to borrow from others, but no one had any money on hand. [illegible text] Finally, I was fortunate enough to borrow one yuan from a friend and bought the lining and also prepared the tailor's wages.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I wore this new lined robe and walked onto XX Street. I took the elevator to the third floor and then walked down halfway. The driver just smiled without saying a word. I guessed that he must be thinking:</p>
<p>"Ah! This is a new silk pongee robe."</p>
<p>So I felt victorious.</p>
<p>But today, unfortunately, an ignorant child unexpectedly peed on me. This is such a big loss for me! So I saw the child's bottom being beaten red by my wife, and large tears fell from her long eyelashes.</p>
<p>Of course, I had to carefully take it to the laundry to be washed. It cost me two dimes to wash and iron it clean, but the faded traces remained conspicuously. Alas! A silk pongee lined robe worth more than ten dollars! ... Maybe this is my fate!</p>
<p>Family Problems</p>
<h3>Brave Women's Army</h3>
<p>— Huoren</p>
<p>This morning at six o'clock, I picked up a country gentleman from the Ning Shao Wharf. Because I didn't have any luggage, I didn't hire a car. Talking and chatting, I walked along the sandy road. When I walked to a street on Zhonghua Road, I saw many people looking into a house. I didn't know what they were looking at. I also walked closer. I only heard the sound of breaking bowls and plates. After a while, it changed to the sound of slapping tables and knocking chairs. Looking into the crowd, they were already fighting fiercely. It was a woman who was beating and scolding, "You rotten slut! You demon! I was charmed by you for two or three nights, you've been hiding your dirty deeds from me. This morning, your lewd tricks were revealed!"</p>
<p>After scolding for a while, she angrily grabbed a man in his forties by the chest and dragged him out, saying, "Come with me to home!" She scolded as she escorted the man away. Seeing the man enduring it with his head down, he must be very afraid of his wife.</p>
<p>Inside the house, there was a woman of about twenty years old. This woman was indeed very beautiful. [illegible text] yesterday's romantic affair: disheveled hair, [illegible text], still fresh, also scolded with a crisp voice: ... [illegible text] ...</p>
<p>From the bystanders, I learned that this woman was the man's concubine.</p>
<p>His wife, because the man had not been home for several nights, tried hard to find out. She rented a house in this place and kept a concubine. Hearing this news, the wife was overcome with jealousy. She came early in the morning to seize the bedding and was indeed able to catch them. After they left, my friend and I also left.</p>
<p>Alas! ... Now, internally and externally, the country is in a crisis, a time to "sleep on brushwood and taste gall." It is pitiful ... that the wealthy compatriots are still indulging in pleasure in the arms of their concubines. Alas! Alas! How can there be a country for them? Where is there a time for "sleeping on brushwood and tasting gall"?</p>
<p>I hope that the wives of men who take concubines will work hard to train a women's army and strive to be a "He Dong Lion's Roar"!</p>

<h3>Changes in Film and Drama Style</h3>
<p>— Rongke</p>
<p>Recently, a change has occurred in the film and drama industry. Social love and gangster fight films that were once popular will soon become relics of the past. The scripts of the former divine and majestic silent films such as *The Ten Commandments*, *The King of Kings*, *The Battle of Flowers*, and *Ben-Hur* will rise again in response to the times.</p>
<p>Social love and gangster fights are common in everyday life. Repeating them in movies will inevitably make the general audience tired of them over time. Audiences psychologically prefer romantic and heroic historical dramas with sound and color from ancient times. Winning the heart of a beautiful woman with a long sword is much more interesting than sweeping with a machine gun. At least, this is the idea of ​​the great director Cecil B. DeMille.</p>
<p>With this idea, DeMille directed a great new film called *The Sign of the Cross*. His eyes are full of enthusiasm for creating this epic film. He told people, "I believe people are tired of watching the popular films and will be disgusted. I will forget the sounds and colors that we see and hear now and describe the glorious history of Rome thousands of years ago. When you watch *The Sign of the Cross*, you will not only get a glimpse of Rome, but you will feel like you are seeing Rome during the reign of Emperor Nero with your own eyes. In this new film, everything in Rome during the Nero era will be completely and truly unfolded before your eyes, scene by scene. Among them is the most beautiful love story that has never been described before. Because the most brilliant gem becomes a dead thing without a proper background, I describe the love story of Marcus and Mercia against the most magnificent background ever created in a film."</p>
<p>DeMille was talking in a room scattered with countless sets used in the film. The huge books piled up prove his research work in creating this new film. People who hear DeMille speak and point cannot help but be moved by his passionate personality and strong ideas. In his eloquent account, people seem to see the great sights of the Roman city again. When Nero is in the palace, and in the arena, on the blood-stained soil, people see the bodies of Christian martyrs being torn apart by the claws of hungry lions to provide entertainment for the Romans.</p>
<p>The glory, strength, brutality, and treachery of Rome are all seen with the naked eye. These characteristics will be captured in *The Sign of the Cross* in the future and become a terrible and beautiful epic script.</p>
<h3>Miss Li Youci, Female Normal School Graduate, Excels in Swimming and Dancing</h3>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>The Charming One</h3>
<p>— Suyi</p>
<p>*Le Chaland* by Parisian students is currently being screened at the Lanxin Grand Theater. *Le Chaland* directly translates to (The Charming One). It is a sound film evolved from a French musical. In terms of plot, the life of Parisian university students described in the play is not fully reflected. The unique scenery of the Latin Quarter (Quartier Latin), the various oddities of Boulevard Saint-Michel (Boulevard St Miche), and the romantic life of university students have not been depicted. Cheating on written and oral exams in major exams is also not entirely reasonable.</p>
<p>In terms of insertion, there are light songs and wonderful dances. The male protagonist, Henry Garat, was originally from a musical theater and has something in common with the world-renowned Chevalier. The female protagonist, Lemmouniere, was originally an actress in a Parisian musical theater (Folie Bere), so the pairing is not too far-fetched. All other roles are dancers from the famous Parisian musical theater (Folie Bere). Scene after scene is inserted, like a series of short-act musicals popular in Paris. So, in simple words, this play is a sound film changed from an opera.</p>
<p>There are several commendable designs in this play: One point is the angels that jump out of the ink bottles on the desks and the many fairies that roll out of the Roman law books that the dissipated university students see in their dreams the night before the exam, circling around on the desk; one point is that a couple is talking under the statues of many celebrities in the university courtyard, and the heads of the statues will dance and sing; and one point is that the people in the paintings on the wall will also wave fans and sing. These don't have any great principles, but the beauty lies in thinking about the unthinkable.</p>

<p>She is not someone who cannot speak! Of course, she will not remain silent in sound films for long!</p>
<p>Introduction to Domestic Films</p>
<h3>The Rise of Hunting Films</h3>
<p>— Yannan</p>
<p>Film is an art produced by the times, so it must follow the times. The old detective films, romance films, ethical films, war and love films, martial arts films, etc., have all fallen behind. Even the song and dance films of one or two years ago have declined. From 1932, what is needed is stimulation, terror, and tension. As a result, hunting films have received a superior position.</p>
<p>This trend has only been popular for a year. Let's take a look, from *Human Beasts* to *Ape Tiger*, *African Little People*, *Tarzan the Ape Man*, *Strange Beasts*, and *Ice Country Spectacle*, which one does not have the great power to be called a hit? Therefore, it is predicted that there will definitely be more of these films produced in large quantities in the future.</p>
<p>The first to advocate shooting Chinese hunting films was Huang Qizha. He was originally an innovator in running film magazines and is now working at Yilian Company. He plans to make six of these epic films. This publication has repeatedly introduced them before, so let's take a look at other companies.</p>
<p>The Times Film Company is a new organization, and perhaps many people don't know about it? Strangely enough, the production of the first film took the path of the times. Called *Going to the Wilderness*, it is directed by Zhu Xuehua and stars the famous dancing star Ms. Li Li. It is said that it will be published soon, and may be ahead of Yilian Company.</p>
<p>There is also *The Story of the Wild Man on the Desert Island*, which was filmed earlier than the Times Company. It is produced by the Happy Forest Company and stars Xu Suzhen and Tang Xueqian. We certainly know that Ms. Xu and Tang are famous figures in Chinese martial arts films. However, the Happy Forest Company is quite unfamiliar. Moreover, there is also a good dog in this film, called Qie Li, just like Rin Tin Tin and Ming Ge. This is also a domestic film innovation.</p>
<p>Good news is coming! Her first sound film *Paradise Bird* has arrived in Shanghai! Her English carries her native accent, which we won't find annoying. Because Chevalier, doesn't he have a French accent? But we find it more lovely than pure English. This film is produced by RKO and is a masterpiece by the famous director King Vidor. The male protagonist is Zoey McRea. The film has arrived in Shanghai, and many people must be looking forward to it. But this is unfortunate. The old theater owners know that this is a hot commodity, and everyone is working hard to compete for rental, so it has not been officially resolved until now. I don't know which lucky theater will win!</p>
<p>However, it won't be delayed for many more days. We will soon be able to see this Spanish girl on the screen! And she also spoke!</p>

<h3>A Discussion on the Trend of Soviet Films in the Last Fifteen Years (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Shi Yi</p>
<p>｜Based on the Opinions of Harry Alan Potamkin｜</p>
<p>The Soviet film, judging by the increasing strength of its progress, can be inferred to become a new realistic and brilliant aspect of Soviet culture. Such an observation may seem like an exaggerated assumption, but I can justify it with a borrowed idiom, (ideological rearmament).</p>
<p>What role should Soviet films occupy? The answer to this question aligns with the evolution of Soviet society. In the initial fourteen years of the Soviet Union, the various necessary and pressing social relationships have now been dissolved into new opportunities and destroyed by the successful establishment of the social system. The steel framework of social structure has already been erected. What is currently needed is to build human diversity upon it. The importance of film in this endeavor is as significant as its importance in the foundation of society because this significance involves rearming the Soviet people with a more precise intellectual arsenal. We can also say that this is the general direction of filmmaking.</p>
<h3>Douglas's Skills</h3>
<p>— Bu Min</p>
<p>Douglas Fairbanks's skills are indeed impressive. Some people say, look, when Los Angeles, USA, held the World Olympic Games, other self-proclaimed stars came to the Olympic Village, strutting around and looking around, but foreign athletes ignored them, and they left feeling bored. But when Fairbanks came, the situation was different. Everyone shouted, "Isn't that Douglas?" So everyone gathered around, took out their diaries, and asked him to sign them as a souvenir. What an honor this is! Because these athletes from all over the world have seen Fairbanks's swordsmanship, boxing, and flying leaps in films. How could they not recognize him upon meeting him today? But a few days ago, when Fairbanks arrived in Shanghai, he told people a story. He said that one day, the American golf champion Jones was playing golf in Hollywood, with countless spectators. Fairbanks himself also went to play golf. Soon, the countless spectators were watching Jones and Fairbanks. Jones felt quite embarrassed. Douglas tells this story to everyone, taking great pride in it. However, Douglas has played golf in Shanghai for several days, losing every match. It is evident that although Douglas creates a sensation everywhere, he truly has the ability to create sensations, and doesn't necessarily need to be superior in martial arts or sports.</p>

<p>Reader's Opinions</p>
<h3>Review of "Adorable Enemies"</h3>
<p>— Li Ling</p>
<p>"Adorable Enemies" is such a moving theme. I was drawn by this title and excitedly went to the Central Theater. I wanted to know the story and also admire Mr. Cheng Bugao's new work. I never bother watching domestic films. It's not that I despise domestic films, but I feel it's a waste of money, time, and energy, and you really can't get anything out of it. In other words, I don't need to watch domestic films. However, this time, I unexpectedly gained considerable satisfaction. I left the theater happily, ran home happily, and felt a kind of feeling happily. I felt that China's film industry is progressing day by day. How gratifying and comforting this is!</p>
<p>I will now write down what I have seen and thought.</p>
<p>The script of "Adorable Enemies" does not have much meaning. Perhaps the author's intention was only to expose the pursuit of love by modern young men and women, while also telling us how sincere friendship can be.</p>
<p>The structure of the play is an ordinary and lengthy story, and it is clearly a microcosm of modern student life. It does not seem to have enough power for society or the youth of today. However, the subject matter of the play is very novel. Although it lacks artistic value, it can be considered a rare gem compared to the current Chinese film scripts.</p>
<p>I had seen one of Cheng Bugao's works before, (Falling Rosy Clouds and a Lonely Wild Duck), but I didn't get any good impression. (Adorable Enemies) can be said to be Mr. Cheng Bugao's unprecedented masterpiece. What I admire most in the whole film is that it is not dull anywhere, and there are many places where the acting talent can be revealed, such as the scene where Zhao Youcheng and Xu Yuanlu snatch the photograph, and the shooting angle when Xu Yuanlu silently thinks on Zhao Youcheng's empty bed after graduation. One can see the director's skills. However, this film is not perfect. There are several places that are unreasonable. Now I will give two of the most obvious examples.</p>
<p>1. After Xu Yuanlu stole the watch, how could he even forget to untie the rope that he had hung up himself? How could anyone be so careless?</p>
<p>2. Zhao Youcheng was hit by the watchman and fell from the wall, desperately fleeing without getting entangled with the watchman. Why was there clearly another scene during the re-release? There are many other minor flaws, but in the current Chinese film industry, where everything is subject to material constraints, we should forgive them.</p>
<p>Next, I want to talk about the actors. The best actor is Gong Jianong, who acts very meticulously without the slightest forcedness. Although Zheng Xiaoqiu's Xu Yuanlu is lively and lovely, some places still feel insufficient, and the expressions are too poor.</p>
<p>Liang Saizhen and Wang Zhengxin don't look like students, or perhaps the two are not suitable for playing this kind of role.</p>
<p>The rest of the actors are neither good nor particularly bad. In summary, this play can be considered one of the better domestic films. Written in Jinglu on November 2nd.</p>
<h3>Legs Became Feet</h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>"Million Dollar Legs", when released in Japan, was called "Million Dollar Feet" because the Japanese film censors are a group of very upright and unyielding people, and anything related to limbs is generally prohibited, especially legs worth a million dollars.</p>

<h3>China's Own Standard of Beauty</h3>
<p>— Chen Dabei</p>
<p>Beginners in calligraphy inevitably trace red characters. In the past, Chinese films were nothing more than buying American red character templates and tracing them. Now we must quickly abandon the red character templates and find the most suitable calligraphy models to imitate. Where are our calligraphy models? Ha! This fits perfectly with the old saying (Far away at the horizon, but close at hand). We don't need to buy our calligraphy models from the outside. To study the art of performance on the screen, everywhere that humans exist is a calligraphy model we can imitate. In your study, in your home, in the homes of your relatives and friends, on the tram, on the train, on the road, in the streets and alleys, where isn't there a calligraphy model you can admire? What is your goal? Isn't it to perform? The secret of performance lies in reflecting society and revealing life. All the major events revealed in society, and even all the subtle details, which one is not a good source of information worth us studying carefully and imitating diligently?</p>
<p>The performance art of Charlie Chaplin, Lillian Gish, and Jannings were all honed and refined from their own environments. They did not come from imitating each other like we did in the past. We must perform the art that we have honed and refined from our own environments on the screen, so that they know that we Chinese are not all shrinking, hunched, queue-wearing, hoof-sleeved oriental monsters. At the same time, we can also let our compatriots see that we don't need drooping eyebrows, sunken eyes, high noses, or curly hair. We have our own oriental, Chinese standard of beauty. This is the most important work in the creative period that we urgently need to realize now.</p>
