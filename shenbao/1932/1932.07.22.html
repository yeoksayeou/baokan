<p>時評</p>
<h3>研究西北開發西北</h3>
<p>猶憶去歲此時。吾人曾多次爲評。呼籲國人急起研究東北。乃不兩月禍變即作。黑山白水。遂以變易其顏色。事纔隔歲。國是日非。山河破碎。敵騎縱横。引領北顧。誠令人黯然不知涙泗之何從。</p>
<p>由於東北之瀹亡。益足以證明我國邊疆問題之嚴重。東北在日人肘腋之下。今已儼然樹立傀儡式之政權。在失地尙未收復之前。吾人雖欲研究。亦不可復得。抑且熱河方面。今已警報頻傳。危機四伏。陰象環生。是則誰又敢斷言</p>
<p>明年此際。西北邊疆。不至爆發與去年九一八同樣之慘變。懲過去之失。爲亡羊補牢之計。吾人今又敢呼籲國人急起研究西北。更進而亟謀開發西北。吾人今茲所稱之。西北。實指陜西寗夏綏遠甘肅新疆青海等而言此環繞我西北邊疆之。廣漠平原。謂爲我國家之屏藩可。謂爲我國家天然之寳藏亦可。然而在强隣窺伺煽動之下。外蒙旣已獨立。西藏亦已離貳。其他各地如青海寗夏新疆諸省。又以種種風俗習慣之不同。與内地人民。更絶少接觸。交通阻滞。情勢日隔。國家民族之觀念。在彼地或極淡薄。甚且依附强鄰。以求庇護。一旦有警。則禍且一發而不可收拾。是則此拱衛我國家之屏藩。實早已不撤而撤矣。至言富源。則雖土質肥美。宜於耕種。森林畜牧。亦復相宜。工業上主要之原料。如鐵煤石油等礦埋藏量。皆極爲豐富。祈連阿爾泰葉爾病　等地之金產。亦爲世界所知名。但此天然之財富。則亦以無人開發。一任其長埋地下。寳藏盈野。不知所取。肥沃原野。半淪廢墟。則此所謂寳藏者。在吾人亦殆已若有若無。我擁寳藏而不知所用。則自足以啓强鄰之窺伺。邊圉不固。屏藩盡撤。旦有警。則雖欲如東北禍變之夕發。而翌晨警報即傳遍全國。亦不可得。何也。西北交通阻滞。情勢隔離。且遠不若東北之交通便利情報迅速也。</p>
<p>近歲以來。開發西北之呼聲甚嚣塵上。赴西北作實地之考察者。亦曾有西北科學考察團及西陲學術考察團。邇近復有多數有志之士。組設專門研究西北問題之團體。隴海路局且將特别招待實地考察西北之志士。吾人切盼此一工作。能由呼聲而得以踐實進行。吾人更切盼國人懲於過去東北之失。羣策羣力。共起推進。以固我疆圉。闢我富源。</p>

<p>左派勢力重大打擊</p>
<p>柏林市仍處包圍狀態中</p>
<p>中央聲明僅屬緊急處置</p>
<p>▲路透二十一日柏林電　巴本之（巨棒）政策、已在普魯士邦完全收效、此後之可一路順利、似無疑義、蓋巴氏在陸軍與警務中有許多心腹、代彼免職之觖望份子也、再巴氏深知來比錫最高法院之判詞、數星期内不致發表、且大約將利於聯邦政府、反對黨今已無權無勇、工聯領袖現命羣衆努力於七月三十一日大選中博取勝利、今尙有一可能的發展、爲共產黨或有被認爲不合法之虞、該黨黨員共有五百萬人、今晨該黨之紅旗報未出版、該報</p>
<p>館經警察搜查、發見一種擬在街中散播煽動人心之傳單後、已遭封閉、巴本現不以大選爲慮、渠覺無一致黨可在國會中佔絶對大多數、今巨頭如白朗與塞佛林均已去職、較小之官員亦正在芟除中、而受國家社會黨熱烈之贊助、希特勒之徒黨因目下該黨幾可控制普魯士邦、而不必待選民之付託、故皆大爲歡忭、</p>
<p>▲國民二十日柏林電　德總統下令造成普魯士邦狄克推多政府後、今夜繼續辦理除舊布新工作、舊閣各閣員悉被擯斥、聞聯邦政府將派聯邦行政委員以代各部總長、舊内長薛佛林於今日傍晚受威迫後、業已屈服、未受逮捕、新任行政委員白拉克將於明日接收普邦内務部、普警察總監格雷率斯基·副總監懷愛士·與警察指揮官海曼斯堡均拒絶解職、被捕後、拘於摩西弼陸軍監獄官長拘留室、但聯邦所派官長接收完畢後、旋即釋放、</p>
<p>▲國民社二十日柏林電　此次德國聯邦政府突然委任普魯士行政委員、說者以爲總理马巴本對於國家社會黨與國權黨之屈服、蓋社會民主黨等各派份子利用國社黨在普議會之弱點、欲乘議會無法推選新總理之僵局、暫以代理内閣保留政權、冀在國會選舉時可居優勢地位、較易挽回頽勢、而國社黨與國權黨等右派份子、亦因此亟欲於選舉前推倒代理内閣、兩院領袖曾迭指普當道無力綏靖境内之政治紛擾堅請聯邦政府採取較强硬手腕、加以干涉、而聨邦政府邇來亦鑒於普境政潮日烈各地種突不絶、知非釜底抽薪、將癥結所在加以解决、難免益形擴大因此遂不顧憲法之拘束、出以非常手段、惟此舉雖係一時之應急處置、而在德國政治史上實爲一九一九年頒布共和憲法以後第　大事、含有兩層重要意味、第一·聯邦政府向來無直接指揮警察之權、今將九萬普警察置於聯邦政府指揮之下、第二·德意志自一八七一年組織聯邦以來、各邦在行政上向保留其主權、俾士麥欲集中權力於中央、而時機未成熟、迨一九一九年頒布共各憲法、雖曾增加中央權力、而大部份行政權仍在各邦政府之手、聯邦内務總長僅能用間接方法、如藉財政等壓迫不受命之列邦政府、今則聯邦政府已操有普魯土之行政權、對於向來行政制度之原則上、不啻起一根本變化、雖聯邦政府鄭重聲明、此次不過應急處置、仍不變向來制度、但旣開此先例、一旦左派份子重握聯邦政府政權後、不難援例以完成其统一國家集權中央之大計劃、故此舉實有深長意味也、</p>
<p>▲國民社二十日柏林電　聯邦政府代表今晚接見外報訪員、解釋政府對普魯士之態度、謂柏林與白蘭豋堡之宣布包圍狀態、並非爲維持該二地治安之一種策略僅擬建設一執行部、俾聯邦政府得在普魯士實行某種計劃、一俟普魯士高級官員願服從聯邦委員會之命令、則包圍狀態即擬中止、聯邦政府希望在七月三十一日之前能中止之、縱或不能、大選仍將於是日舉行、該發言人竭力否認緊急命令中關於電報電話郵件之規定、乃圖檢查各項新聞、末謂俟普魯士議會依法定多數舉出總理、則普魯士大局即可認爲恢復常狀云、</p>
<p>▲國民社二十一日柏林電　今晨柏林情日之事變、恐民間亦將不知已在宣佈包圍狀態（即緊急情形與戒嚴微殊）之中也街市中安堵如平日、不見兵士蹝跡、各政黨亦咸取審愼態度、免滋事羰、國家社會黨總部星期二已先得訊、曾命挺進隊忽去街衢避免衝突、蓋就大體言之、柏林人民已能迅速在新狀態中安居樂業、昨日左派所發生之震驚、其退減之速、更出於預料以外。今日即左派報紙論調亦顯見緩和、大有暫守緘默趨向。右派報紙當然歡忭、視此爲肅清工作之第一聲、惟昨夜之柏林雖爲自巴本政府成立以來最安靖之夕、第在南效带、曾有共產黨二百人企圖傾覆一電車及一公共汽車、會緊急隊驅至、得免肇禍、現握柏林市警</p>
<p>權之第三軍區司令倫將軍今日晤新聞記者、將仍守僅用警察平靖紛擾之舊計劃、非至萬不得已、不調軍隊、並否認宣告包圍狀態之舉、侵犯普邦憲法權利、今日包工會領袖已電召來京、惟共黨雖鼓噪總罷工、聞工會領袖不贊成此舉、已勸各會員安心照常工作、社會民生黨今日亦在總部開會討論應付辦法、聞總理巴本明日將以普魯士行政委員長資格、召集各新委員會議、討論保護人民免受共黨滋閙之方法、現信將採取最嚴厲手段對付共黨云、</p>
<p>▲國民社二十一日柏林電　今晨十時柏林已回復常狀、國家社會黨與共產黨之巷戰、爲此次德總統斷然處置之直接原因、今國社黨目的旣達、已不復滋生事端、共黨則警察頗感應付之不易、迄今晨十時止、已逮捕九十餘人、控以散發傳單煽動柏林與白蘭登堡工人總罷工之罪、此外復查抄此間共產黨總部、暫派警察把守、屋内印刷機亦被没收、故共黨之紅旗報今日下午已不能出版、</p>

<h3>日齋藤内閣下的農村救濟策懷仁</h3>
<p>東京通信</p>
<p>犬養内閣崩潰、齋藤軍閥内閣代之以興、軍人們都來自田間、他們要擁護的利益、不消說是農村中父老們的利益、而非當年政黨内閣時代所把握着的工商業中心主義、因此齋藤於組閣之初、對内第一件的標榜、就是（農村救濟策）、以皮還皮、以骨還骨、本來是一種極自然的結果</p>
<p>齋藤組閣後不久、第六十二次臨時議會開幕、這次議會遺下了許多關於農村救濟的决議案、政府方面跟着開了幾次五省聯席會議、討論議會决議案的内容、同時由各省擬具各種具體方案、準備開始實行、但這些具體方案、對於奄奄一息的日本農村、是否能有（起死回生）之效、目前吾人尙不敢妄加斷語、但在此世界經濟百孔千瘡之際、說日本農村即能因救濟策而景氣重來、又似乎是一個疑問、以下、很率直的介紹一些關於日本農村救濟策的具體方案、</p>
<p>一農林省方面</p>
<p>（Ａ）低資償還延期、從明治四十三年到昭和七年五月止、自大藏省預金部融通的普通資金决定額、共計三億四千三百七十三萬五千三百五十元、從大正十二年到昭和七年五月止、自大藏省預金部通融的特别資金决定額、共計五億六千七百六十三萬八千五百元、兩資金合計九億一千萬元、但實際融通的僅七億元左右、歷年來已歸還三億元、目前大約尙殘存四億元、而其中八千萬元之清償期爲本年九月末日、農林省方面、打算先把本年的應償數額、延期三年或五年、以後再按年分還、</p>
<p>（Ｂ）五億元之融資、融通五億元的低利資金、做各種開墾、耕地整理、用排水幹線工事、漁港修築、築磯及林道開發等事業、此項低利資金是長期的、同時政府還給以相當之利息、</p>
<p>（Ｃ）料穀统制最近農林省新設一米穀部、着手料穀之調查研究、（調查費十萬元、已列入本年度追加預算而通過於議會、）以期調節内地米·臺灣米·及外米之需給、而由國家管理統制、</p>
<p>（Ｄ）產繭统制政府買入目前之存絲、同時統制未來的生產、统制蠶種、調節產額、一方更縮小桑園面積、把現在荒蕪着的桑園、改植小麥、對於產繭方面、將利用乾繭倉庫以維持其價格、且澈底整理各地絲行、	統制其販賣、　　（Ｅ）肥料统制農林省原擬實行肥料監督制、以除去不正肥料分配之弊、後以預算關係而中輟、將來打算把肥料統制歸入米穀部辦理、</p>
<p>（Ｆ）國營大開墾據農林省的調查、今日在日本的五百町步以上之集團未開墾地、大約有四十萬町步左右、分十一地區、由國家經營開墾、</p>
<h3>二、内務省方面</h3>
<p>（Ａ）土木事業計劃、内務省準備於三年間、繼續爲三億五千萬元之土木事業、（一）道路改良、一千五百里五億五千萬元、（二）小河川改修二百六十河川、一億二千萬元、（三）地方港灣、二百港灣八千萬元、第一年之事業費爲一億三千萬元○分、</p>
<p>町村事業、五千八百萬元、平均分配於全國一萬二千個町村、這町村事業費的四分之三（四千三百萬元、）由國庫負担、其餘之千四百萬元、由町村負担、但可通融以極長期的無利息之資金、再町村事業之勞力費、占總事業費的百分之五十、</p>
<p>國直轄及府縣事業七千二百萬元、勞力費占總事業費的百分之四十、</p>
<p>（Ｂ）其他之計劃（一）政府於可能範圍内、應交付地方農村六年度低資融通七千四百五十萬圓、七年度低資融通二千七百萬圓、使窮迫之農村得有財政之援助、（二）對於低資之償還、應規定期間、其間暫緩付欵、（三）活用罹災救助金、使流入於農村、（四）府縣負擔之中小學敎員之恩給、應由國庫負擔、（五）减輕地方稅、使農民稍舒負擔、同時應改正納稅制度、允許現物納稅、（六）速使鑛產稅之一部、委讓於地方、（七）有雜種財產之町村、如遇歲入困難時、應由國家支付以（交付金）、</p>
<h3>三、大藏省（財政部）方面</h3>
<p>大藏省預全部的各種貸付資金中、本年的應債還額是八千八百萬圓、其中農業關係貸付金是四千萬圓、照目前的情勢論、已非承認償還延期不可、至处延期結果所生的資金不足、由預金部認募的二億圓公債中、劃出一部分、轉嫁於日本銀行以塡補之、</p>
<h3>四、鐵道省方面</h3>
<p>鐵道省因振興地方農村起見、預備提早完成鐵道的建設、據三土鐵相的計劃、打算每年增發公債一千萬圓、於昭和七八九三年中、完成日本國有鐵道網、日本農村救濟策的具體方案、大槪是如此而已、至其结果如何、祇得一年或兩年後的事實了、</p>
<h3>東北民衆痛苦情形</h3>

<h3>炎夏雜感二一枝譚</h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>荷花怕風不怕日，風來時，總是東躱西閃·，見了赤日炎炎，却是獨立不倚的抵抗着。</p>
<p>仰面朝天的荷葉，宛似害着消渴症的司馬相如，要向上帝乞取金莖露一杯。</p>
<p>寒暑表在九十度以上，我們藝術的思想，小說的意與，都化做了淋淋漓漓的汗，一陣一陣的淌個不休。</p>
<p>知了！知了！他是暴日底下的呐喊者！熱度愈高，他的呐喊聲愈急·，可是得了一些凉風，他的呐喊聲便低了！</p>
<p>知了！知了！又似蟲世界開的暑期學校·，暑期一過，讀書聲便戞然而止了。</p>
<p>高高的踞着悲翠無臺，守候池中荷花開放的，是誰？便是釘住在荷葉上面的蜻蜓。</p>
<p>赤化了半天雲霧，天上也建設着蘇維埃政府，往來的官吏，都張着火繖而行。</p>
<p>佛家言··内想大火，久之覺然，内想大水，久之覺寒。心理上的　暑法，只須在方寸間築起着清凉之府··任憑赤日當空，我只算是油然作雲，沛然下雨·，那麽，自有一陣無形無聲的充分甘霖，熄滅了我們心頭焦灼的火。</p>
<h3>英士紀念堂内之兩大紀念物</h3>

<p>被拘時之木凳紀念堂對面特闢一室。中置兩尺高五尺長一尺五寸寛之木凳一隻。上貼白紙。書（革命之基）四大字。并附註曰。（曩攻製造局。我先烈陳公英士。率領志士。爲民前鋒。雖被困此凳一宵。卒獲勝利。滬市賴以光復。驅除胡虜還我山河。實基於是凳。謹弁數語。以誌紀念。）蓋辛亥武漢起義後。英士先生擬在南京響應。因鐵良張勳負嵎。無從下手。乃回上海部署進行。九月十三日進攻製造局時。該局駐守軍隊一部分已表示贊成革命。一部分猶表示反對。依舊抵抗。英士先狂不忍漢人白相殘殺。願徒手進局向反抗之軍隊開導。詎料抵局後。果爲駐軍拘留。以鐵索將其鎖於是凳。計一宵。各同志在外聞之。努力猛攻。將局攻破。始光復上海。遂公舉陳君爲滬軍都督。并將此凳携出。加以保存。</p>
<p>遇害時之血衣凳旁有玻璃櫉一。内懸鼻烟呢夾袍。曁玄色花緞馬褂各一。下置夾襖及短衫褲等三件。細視之。衣上血跡甚多　。蓋此即民國五年五月十八日。英士先生在上海法租界薩坡賽路十四號。被人狙擊時所穿之服也。當時反對帝制。英士先生以屢次失敗。經費困難。匿居是屋。袁世凱懸重賞。募人暗殺。駐滬袁探知英士先生近况甚窘。遂由許國霖程子安等。假設鴻豐煤鑛公司。勾通民黨叛徒李海秋。謂該公司有鑛地。擬向日人押欵。如英士先生能介紹。則所押之欵。十分之四可充革命經費。英士先生信以爲眞。承認介紹。約定是日在寓簽字。李海秋等抵寓後。託言忘带合同底稿。出門往取。暴徒即於是時拔槍向英士先生頭部射擊。腦部連中數槍。登時氣絶。所流之血。均在衣上。殁後故珍藏以留紀念。是日由肇和兵艦發難時之海軍陸戰隊正司令楊虎在是室招待。向來賓詳述當時情况。故來賓中對於此一隻木凳。五件血衣咸具無窮之感慨也。</p>
<h3>熱情的衝動</h3>
<p>— 錢台生</p>
<p>近來看東北義勇軍後援會所收到的募捐欵項數目，和上海及各地人士對（東北沉淪）的冷淡，不得不使我們痛心！上海的日軍，果然猶堅持未去，遙望東北健兒天天在血水裏打滾，一定更可以猜想，正和日軍進攻閘北，江灣，廟行諸役，一樣的用大口徑的鋼砲在轟炸，一樣的用戰鬥機轟炸機在空中對熱血的健兒猛烈投擲！</p>
<p>烽火起處，也正是一個人心未死的民族，對近代的武器作了無數次血肉的火迸！</p>
<p>這爭鬥的意義，也便是民族性崛起的反抗。</p>
<p>我們可以以過去九一八事變，看看全中國那時是多麽熱情，多麽可愛的壯烈的表示呵，那時民衆的熱度是不是已達到了白熱化？馬占山的高吭一呼抵抗，喚起了多少熱情呢？從來没有爲祖國流過眼涙的人，也流出了眼涙！同時且看，全國幾乎陷入一種沸騰狀態，電匯，郵匯，募捐，幾乎表現了（中國有辦法）</p>
<p>的積極表示，在這種民族熱情底下，你應該不會相信那時暫時的衝動竟會一縷烟化爲烏有？</p>
<p>一二八事變發生了，大砲的聲音和軋軋飛機的聲音，驚心動魄地展開在我們眼前，於是又是各地總動員，募捐，小姐少奶奶做絲綿背心，女學生上前線作看護，男學生掮上了槍隨軍對敵。中國有望了，當然囉，因爲誰都覺醒了，那大砲的聲音，也不得不使你醒醒呀！但停戰恊定一簽字，我們天天看見日軍一船一船裝回去，於是心頭放下來了，因爲上海和吳淞砲台還是我們的。</p>
<p>東北呢？還正在烽烟連天死屍狼藉，繼續正在受着近代武器的蹂躪呀！</p>
<p>眞的！我們便把我們的東北和三千萬的同胞都忘記了！</p>
<h3>兩段雋妙的軼事</h3>
<p>— 黄人</p>
<p>蕭伯訥在俄難斯英國大戲劇家蕭伯訥ＢｅｒｎａｒｄＳｈａｗ最近曾作俄羅斯之遊。有一天他正沿著伏爾加河Ｖｏｌｇａ散步。忽然遇著一個美貎的小女郎在弄著沙頑。他就立住了脚和伊攀談起來。那小女郎一見了這白鬚子的老伯伯很爲歡喜。便撒下了沙。伴他一同在河邊散步。伊的小手兒給他攙著。一面走。一面談著瑣瑣屑屑的事情。蕭老先生心花怒放。樂而忘倦。末後那小女郎向他告别。說是時候不早。要回家去了。他欣然的說道。（吾愛再見。要是你的母親問起你在那裏時。你對伊說剛和喬治蕭伯訥一同在伏爾加河邊散步。他老人家的意思是以爲他的鼎鼎大名。無論到那裏。總是婦孺皆知的。但那小女郎却不知道。也學著他的神情。微笑著鞠躬道。（你老人家回去時。你家裏的人倘問起你在那裏時。你對他們說剛和嘉德玲娜福杜洛維克一同在伏爾加河邊散步。）</p>
<p>帝王是懒蟲最近英國國會中提起一個有關恩餉的問題。就記起一筆歷年最久的恩餉來。這恩餉是當年英王却爾士二世ＣｈａｒｌｅｓＩＩ賜與潘恩特來Ｐｅｎｄｅｒｅｌｌ家的。至今還是由散處美國與澳洲的潘恩特來後裔照領。不過該欵並不由英國國庫真接支出。而由王室委託人就收入的田租項下撥付的。這恩餉的來源。却有一段有趣的故事包含在内。當華瑟斯德Ｗｏｒｅｓｔｅｒ一戰中。却爾士王一敗涂地。革命首領ＣｒｏｍＷｅｌｌ的部隊到處搜尋。定欲得之而甘心。却爾士王躱藏在潘恩特來家的鮑司可培屋ＢｏｓｅｃｏｂｅｌＨｏｕｓｅ中。有一在兵隊突然來搜。王正閒坐在廚房裏看烹調。危險萬分。執而有一位女太太</p>
<p>很有急智。立時走到王的面前。拍的打了</p>
<p>他一下耳刮子。將伊抱著的嬰孩塞在他的臂間。一面怒駡道。（你這懶蟲。快抱著孩子。待我領他們去搜查。）兵士們那裏會疑到這懶蟲就是帝王。隨意搜了一會。就告罪而去。却爾士王因此脫險。以後就年年賜與他們一筆恩餉。一直沿襲下來。以至於今。</p>
<h3>藝術的技巧</h3>
<p>— 倪貽德</p>
<p>在新聞紙上，時常可以看到我們的政治家，軍人，偉人們，在從政之餘，或失意下野之後，有習字作畫的消息。然而那些人，我懷疑他們是根本不了解藝術的。他們不過是藉此自命風雅或更含有其他的目的而已。對於陳樹人先生我最初也有這樣的懷疑，但看了他這次的展覽會後，才證明了我最初對於陳先生</p>
<p>的懷疑完全是錯誤了。</p>
<p>何以故？這是我從陳先生的畫面上看出了他對於技巧確有深的修養的原故。</p>
<p>現在一般人對於繪畫上技巧的問題實在誤解得厲害。我在這裏想略略的解釋一下。一般人的所謂技巧，便是指能夠把物象的表面描寫得维妙維肖，或者把前人的作品模仿得維妙維肖的一種手段。但單是有這樣技巧，只能說是死的技巧，是完全和作家的精神遊離，不過是手的工作而已。所謂眞的技巧者、應以十分藝術地表現藝術家的精神生活爲條件。美學者Ｌａｌｏ說，藝術的本質是一種技巧。但這種技巧决不是和精神生活遊離的，那是以十分藝術的地表現藝術家的精神生活爲使命，而不使生命枯死的具體的創作。所以技巧者，可說是以更現實的精神使精神表現出來的物質的制約。</p>
<p>有人說，藝術應當忘却了技巧。但是這忘却的技巧，是死的技巧，有生命的技巧不是我們所最熱望的嗎？一切的藝術，不是都用了全力在否定死的技巧而探求着獨自的有生命的技巧嗎？所以眞的藝術家、他的一生都是在這技巧不斷地探求。最初從一般的基本的技巧的修得，而漸次脫離出來，探求着獨自的技巧！無技巧的技巧了。就像泥池中的運花，她吸取了一切的養分，而開出純潔鮮艶的花來的一樣。這樣的技巧，是和作家的精神合成一起的，他的技巧到達的地方，作家的精神生活也隨之表現出來了。</p>
<p>陳樹人先生就是具有這樣的眞的技巧的一位藝術家。他所使用的線條是那樣的優秀而潇灑，正是他的高潔的人格的象徵。而他的色彩之鮮艶而冷靜，正表現了南國人的明快的Ｄｅｌｉｃａｔｅ的感覺。他的Ｍａｔｉｖｅ都是從自然中取來的，然而他不爲自然的外形所拘束，也不過意作奇怪的Ｄｅｆｏｒａｔｉｏｎ只是自然的地依了自已的感覺表現出來，而在那裏便流出豐富的微妙的詩意！這便是陳先生的繪畫上最能感人的地方　　陳先生的繪畫上的技巧達到了這樣的獨自之境，我們可以說就是從自然的觀照而來的。晚近的國畫已走到了不通的末路，這是誰都首肯的事。要求國畫的出路，我以爲只有捨棄前人作品的因襲與模倣，而到自然中探求新的途徑。所謂到自然中去探求，並不是說要去模倣自然，照樣地去描寫自然，乃是指從自然中去一感得）而言，換言之，便是從自然中去發現自我，表現自我。可惜現在一般的國畫家，都没有覺悟到這一層。而政治家革命家的陳樹人先生，却在勇敢地實行了。他在自然的觀照中，發現了獨自的搆圖，獨自的線條，獨自的色彩，獨自的詩意了。這些，都是此外任何人所能表現出來的。</p>

<p>人標跌後即漲人標前市開盤、市氣尙平、以外棉稍跌、後以二三盤聞粤帮購辦興旺、人心又振、各月均漲三·四·五·六錢、成交一萬五千二百包、午後以天氣奇熱、逈異往昔、已自上日起暫停午後營業、祇做前市半天、至八月二日止、又查賣出永昌八百五十包、益昶六百包、裕大五百五十包、大昌成四百五十包、森康四百五十包、買進長豐九百五十包、恊生五百包、永大四百包、仁豐四百包、賡豐四百五十包、吉豐四百包、茲將人標收盤價、分别如下、</p>

<h3>棉花徘徊不前</h3>
<p>棉市平庸而無特色、形勢平靜、因本棉底貨日枯、人心挺莠、買氣堅穏、實需較活、各廠雖無大量進意、然零碎需要尙不斷絶、惟賣方大户、視美棉呈盤旋之局、抛賣之心似濃、故壓力尙重、前途如何、仍依美棉爲伸縮也、</p>

<h3>糧食河米市穏定</h3>
<p>周浦新粳不日抵滬</p>
<p>滬南昨日各路來船約計十餘號、而浦存無幾、城鄉店銷日見清淡、因洋米棧積豐厚、昨有社會局派員調查、實數共有一百廿五萬、人心平靜常錫北粳及蘇同帮到銷二平、市無升沉、早晚稻貨缺、開盤稍漲五分、蘆洋尖到銷兩稀、形亦带起、</p>
<p>新閘昨米市西路來源有限、因于時異常炎熱、買方態度清淡、崑山溧陽米開盤降低一尺、常帮頂貨祇有零碎斛脚、形勢堅穏、早薄稻及洋杜尖等貨、　無榮辱據周浦來訊、浦東新粳一二天内亦可抵滬、</p>
<h3>中次小絞跌小三五分</h3>
<p>昨日洋米市况、較形起色、因寗波帮胃口仍香、昨日又得天津帮試辦小絞五百包、本街内地散户均有問津、故高貨略挺、中次各檔以天熱防壞、貨主求售甚力、市價未能轉機、低次者反見疲小三五分、乃與高小絞轉形挺勢者適成反趨、結果全市成交新小絞二千多包、價九元二角至九元、中次八元九角半至八元八角、陳小絞四千包、價八元七角半、係甬帮獨帮辦去、新小絞除津辦外、尙有鎭江内地本街等去化、本街又辦紅小絞二百包、價七元九角一分云、</p>
<h3>粉市絶少新交易</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份大致呈平定之象、以洋麥報價互有出入、市塲賣買沉寂、新交易實少活動、以廠方擯住、不肯暢抛、北路客帮、因時局關係、標凖均無心思、遇有銷活之時、卽批購現貨、所以市面停寂、甚覺不可思議也、（聞津帮曾辦成現貨價爲一兩九錢二分半數尙未詳）、結果本月份較前日小五厘、八九月份小二厘半、十月份好二厘半、十一月份未動、十二月份好二厘半云、</p>
<h3>本月麥浮多已有出檔</h3>
<p>糧交停拍午後市面</p>
<p>昨日期麥上午開盤後、各月份呈近疲遠平之象、本月份前雖有軋空之舉、惟目下多數空户、一無動靜、大致已預備交貨、大多户亦未出、雙方擯住、惟一般浮多則反逐有出檔、致市氣反見</p>
<p>不振、較前日又小三分、八月份亦小一分、餘無上落、至下午市面、經上午臨時决定、因天熱關係、停止開拍、自本日起至八月十四日爲止、現麥市况、尙見平穏、廠胃亦尙活絡、開直塘支塘麥二兩九錢六分、次至八錢半、蓬萊麥二兩七錢三分、次至六錢八分、嘉定麥二兩七錢六分、陸家浜麥二兩八錢半、次至八錢二分、太倉來二兩七錢半、計開二千五百包云、</p>
<p>[P糖市粗砂白市趨沉寂</p>
<p>太古糖交易活躍</p>
<p>昨日糖市公會市塲劃盤、交易清淡、人氣則穏、荷糖二十四號粗砂白價仍十四兩四錢、普通貨十四兩三錢、八號荷赤油袋貨劃十兩○四錢、買氣殊靜、市見平定、太古糖進出雖見活躍、但以各處去胃未暢、故交易額殊甚零星、Ｂ嘜十六兩三錢、ＣＷ嘜十五兩八錢、烟台來ＣＸ嘜十五兩五錢半、ＤＹ嘜十五兩五錢、ＨＸ嘜十五兩三錢半ＨＭ嘜十四兩九錢、Ｈ嘜十二兩六錢、ＰＸ嘜十一兩二錢、比前日市價雖少變更、第市形頗爲活躍、殊具打破不景氣之趨勢云、</p>
<h3>南北貨新糯米枝首批到申</h3>
<p>開八十一兩八</p>
<p>廣東所產糯米枝、甘芳適口、去年因失收乏到、但查今庚收成尙佳、首批貨昨已到申、當由南市號家邀集各行於午後開盤、共計僅十件、身色俱佳、旋以八十一兩八錢成盤、如後多到、或可看鬆云、</p>
<h3>絲茶黄白廠經銷清價疲</h3>
<p>本埠洋莊絲市幾趨停滞、黄白廠經衹英印等莊稍有零星補空交易、綢門銷胃亦趨疲靜、昨祇怡和進月兎牌十三至十五條份滬白廠經十包、價五百六十兩、美亞進中身Ｂ級十八至二十二條份滬白廠經五包價四百八十兩、安利進鐵機十三至十五條份川黄廠經五包、價五百四十兩、三星進小車十三至十五條份川黄廠經三包、價四百二十兩</p>
<h3>針眉綠茶歐銷續暢</h3>
<p>昨日婺源屯溪等路之針眉綠茶、各歐莊進意濃厚、交易旺盛、到貨極少停留、貢熙一項、婺源最高莊貨、頗形俏手、昨由瑞昌洋行、買進義芳永牌、價開一百三十兩、爲近年以來未有之高價、低莊玉山温州等路貨、去路亦頗活潑、惟中莊貨因俄莊觀望抑價市面尙在停頓中、其餘珍眉珠茶大帮等項、均有活動之趨勢云、</p>
<p>[P煤炭天熱煤銷清淡&gt;</p>
<p>日來天氣酷熱、煤斤需用銳减、每日市塲人數到者亦稀、故煤斤交易、甚覺清淡、昨日全市成交各貨、統計不滿二千噸、貨價均呈疲勢、如松浦煙煤塊每噸售九兩進關、祇售八兩七錢半、神田元山等塊、亦各跌落三四錢云、</p>

<p>陳致朱函朱查陳三代表、與陳濟棠會晤後、陳除以口頭向朱等解釋粤變經過外、並以書面作鄭重之報告、原函長千餘言、業見港報、茲再擇述其大意如下、（一）上海廢戰同盟會、迭電籲請息爭、其所以未能作復者、實因整理海空軍、係東南致會之决議、令一集團章執行者、旣非個人之舉、尤非陸海空軍之舉、故無須以個人名義答復、（二）空軍自設總司令部後、内部轉覺不如往日團結、財政不公開、軍需處長等侵佔公欵、迫不得已、議决改隸、（三）海軍總部經費浩大、平時消耗、無異戰時、令其勦匪等、輒遭拒絶、偷運鴉片私鹽等營私舞弊、則尤無所不爲、政會自不得不撤底整理云、</p>
<h3>二十年度本市財政槪况</h3>
<p>不敷約一百餘萬元</p>
<p>本市自受戰事影響、政府收入銳減、雖曰竭力緊縮、而收入相抵、猶有不敷、昨據財政局秘書陳輝棣發表本市二十年度財政槪况如下、</p>
<p>收入支出槪况查本市二十年度收入槪算、據各機關所列、計總數爲七百餘萬元、除於收入總數内提出黨務費債務費恊助費等共約二百餘萬元外、總計支配於各機關經常費之需者、僅五百餘萬元、以百分比支配、計市府佔百分之四五財政佔百分之六·六、衛生佔百分之五、公用佔百分之六·六、土地佔百分之七·四公安佔百分之二七·六、敎育佔百分之二一·七、工務佔百分之一五·八、社會佔百分之四·八惟因支出槪算、中央核准已遲、未及實施仍依照十九年度舊預算支付、但因事實上業務進展情形、業經陸續核准追加者、爲數不少、與新預算亦復相近、現在廿年度甫經終了、市庫各項收支賬目、尚未結束清楚、所有實收實支分析細數、尙難明瞭、但全年度收入約數、爲八百餘萬元、支出約數爲九百餘萬元、再連轉賬各欵在内、市庫向係統收統支、相衡不敷約一百餘萬元、該項不敷之數、須轉入下年度彌補、查本市稅收銳减之原因、完全以一二八事變發生、市府雖屢行緊縮政策、各項經費、極度節約、而特别支出與售後費用、則因之激增、　　應付、　費簡章云、</p>
<p>又該營業稅徵收處周副處長發表營業稅情形如下、</p>
<p>營業稅之情形本市營業稅、自去年七月一日委托本市商會轉請各業公會辦理以來、一般商人、尙能遵章辦理、但本市商店中其未加入同業公會者、尚屬多數、市商會對於該項未加入同業公會之商店徵收營業稅、似多困難、現在本市商會赴京請願代表王延松、已向中央請求令飭各商店應一律加入同業公會、此事如能辦到、於商界本身之團結上、固有橋大關係、而於本市徵收營業稅、亦可便利多多矣、至於上年徵收情形、在夏秋二季、徵收成績尚佳、</p>
<p>冬春兩季、因本市受戰事影響、已由財政局轉知市商會一律豁免、本市營業稅徵收數量、照去年調查所得情形、如完全收齊、每　可有二三十萬之多、而外人方面、尙不在内、黴收外人營業稅問題、茲專體夫、須俟市府向各領交涉妥當、方可開始徵收、</p>

<h3>市商會電請鐵道部减晋煤運費</h3>
<p>否則國煤永不昭蘇</p>
<p>市商會昨電鐵道部、請减晋煤運費、免致激成事變、而利國煤推銷、原文云、南京鐵道部鈞鑒、本月二日、接山西大同晋北礦務局山西大同煤業公司保晋分公司聯合函稱、晋化煤藏宏富、煤質優良、歷經運銷海外、及滬漢閩港各大商埠工廠輪船、無不極端稱道、認爲最上燃料、不幸地居遷陸、距最近海口、竟有六百公里之遙、而平綏路局、復忽視鐵路國營之本旨、對於獎勵國產煤觔、扶助出口貿易等事、未肯加以注意、祇圖加增本路收大、致晋煤運費之高昂、呈冠絶全國之奇態、民國十九年、部頒之晋煤運輸專價、每公噸每公里七厘三二、亦僅能借以推銷、煤觔並無大利、然在二十年春、竟並此而亦呈部取消之、現在每噸煤觔、由口泉運往豐台、計路程四百公</p>
<p>里、運費幾至六元、轉裝塘沽、雖蒙北寗路局稍予核减、亦尚需再加約一元七角、卽晋北之煤出口、每噸需運費約七元七角、其他雜費尙不與也、而敵煤如撫順煤之在津沽、九州煤之在淞滬、售價亦不過八九元、卽將煤無償奉送、亦有不能競爭之勢、於是晋煤之輸出、日趨衰落、晋民之生計、亦因大受影響、近自滬變以後、市塲更形蕭條、折本銷售、且難脫手、日煤乘機活動、恃其國家之調劑、雄厚之資本、敏捷之運輸、横加壓迫、故晋煤前途、除將平綏運費徹底减輕外、殊覺暗淡、近聞膠濟路爲救濟山東國煤起見、允將運費减輕以外、並允各礦煤觔、先記報運赴海口、等煤觔售出後、再行核收運費、此誠不失爲抵制日煤救濟國煤之有效辦法、晋煤之急待援救、前曾辱承貴會聲援、代向各方請命、今更迫切、務懇體念國艱、培植國本、轉呈　部令飭平綏北寗兩路、將晋煤運價確實减低、以便與敵煤競售、借杜漏巵、並准援用膠濟辦法、以利商艱、不勝盼禱之至等語、查晋煤自上年五月間增加運費、成本加重、推銷爲難、歷經屬會請求仍照舊章辦理、未邀批准、現自滬變平定以後、撫順九州之煤、風騰雲集、一致向我市塲傾銷、國煤以成本過重、力難抗爭、銷路一落千丈、致近有淄博各礦、發生停工之事、現在路局方面、已有徇礦商請求减費四成允意、以資救濟、晋省煤產豐旺、惟因運費奇昂、採銷每爲所扼、際茲國難時期、外煤侵略不已、不將國煤運費减輕、使之開拓銷路、則淄博礦變已爲前車之鑒、而晋省亦恐蹈覆　之懼、將使國内煤業、永無昭蘇之望、據函前情、理合電呈鈞部鑒核、俯准將平綏·北寗·兩路晋煤運費、切實减低、俾塞漏巵、而安民生、無任迫切待命之至、上海市商會叩號、</p>
<h3>蘇五屬之鹽稅</h3>
<p>鹽爲人生日用所必需之品、就舊有之統計言之、每人日食三錢、年食七斤、（此說源於管子、雖古今度置衡不同、然可知其約數、）無閒男女老幼、銷耗幾於相等、我國自春秋齊有官山賦海之說、漢有桓寛鹽鐵之論、鹽遂占中國國家歲計上之重要部分、歷朝以來、代有興革、然於征榷原則、始終相沿、特稅額高下、征收方法、因時改變而已、惟相習以降、鹽權雖屬諸國家、承辦厥賴於商户、且其中科目極細、另有系統、故幾爲一般人士所不願研究、即每有加稅、間接出之商民、直接出之食户、而以平均率分配之、第斤所加有限、食户購鹽又絶少大批存儲者、故仍復不加注意、不知鹽稅於國家財政上關係固鉅、而個人日用必需、尤有切身之利害、此遭兩淮蘇浙長蘆等處、增加鹽稅、尅日實行、本報尤以蘇五屬之稅率、於江南淞滬之食户、大有關係、特先加調查、并就訊於鹽政專家、歷歷披露、俾食户有所覽焉、</p>
<p>世人往往以鹽爲私人之專業、此說似是而實非也、鹽之切於日用、同於茶米絲帛、何以其他同具課稅不屬專業、而鹽獨屬之、蓋國家立法之意、以鹽之需用、尤勝於粟米絲茶、不特爲飲食調味之需、且爲衛生營養之用、惟其益形普遍、則不得不益持愼重、且課稅之數量至鉅、關係乎國計者至大、故不得不列以爲國家之事業、以今日之學說言之、正或國家資本主義之濫觴乎、</p>
<p>惟鹽權雖屬之國家、而國家勢難自爲經營、且行鹽爲商業性質之行爲、即由國家經營、官辦事業、未必能著成效、故相習以降、國家遂以營業屬之商家、厲行盬督、别設鹽政官廳、以别於行政官廳、其對於鹽務之注意、亦可謂至矣盡矣、</p>
<p>鹽爲人生必需之品、無論都市窮鄉、均不能不妥爲支配、使免於淡食、然而商家承辦、多以博得利益爲前提、惟產鹽之區、全國又祇有若干處所、勢非如茶米粟帛之隨地可致、故倘不加以限制、專其責任、則商家必且徒就利藪、匯集於都市、窮鄉僻壤、居民旣少、運輸維艱、其又誰願致之、故國家勢又不能不指定若干人、嚴其保證、督其承銷、確定其營業區域、限制其營業額數、俾盈虧可以互濟、（按一省有都會·有鄉村·商人負此責任、即須全部顧到、都會獲得盈餘、邊遠區域、容或少有虧折、以資調劑、）行銷可以普遍、此若干人者、格於功令、萬無諉避責任之可能、而衡以權利義務相平等之原則言之、責任旣不能避免、盈餘亦自屬其報酬、後人以爲專商之說所由來也、</p>
<p>以中國幅員之大、而產鹽旺盛、不過沿海諸區、腹地如四川、甘肅山西河南湖北、雖亦間有出品、然均供不敷求、即此沿海產鹽之區、亦以滷質成分之不同、成本遂有高下之别、若國家聽其自由行銷、則成本輕者勢必占取優勢、成本高者、必且無人過問、如此、則不特成本輕者、亦固不足敷全國之用、而成本較昂之區、仰食於製鹽之工人以百十萬計、又必發生失業之虞、故國家爲調節供求起見、又爲畫定行鹽區域、使某處所產者、行銷某處、庶免運商採辦儘擇廉價、引起糾紛、此即引岸制度之由來也、</p>
<p>鹽旣爲國内之重要物品、又從而課其捐稅、且稅額往往高出於成本、因之私運私售者、得獲倍蓰之利、而販私者、自日益以多、政府固一面嚴辦緝私、爲治標之計、以杜絶無稅鹽之運售、然貪利者、且或　不畏法、固非徒緝私所能奏效、則爲治本之計、於捐稅亦不能不分等級、如產鹽附近地點、及私鹽所易至之區域、捐稅特廉、庶使私鹽難獲厚利、販者或可歛跡、至遙遠之區、關津重疊、巡緝易嚴、則捐稅較重、以裕國課、惟鹽爲人生所必需、而每年每人又不過七八斤、則捐稅雖苛、負擔亦正有限、此國家立法之至意、蓋普徵於人民、聚少以爲多、亦未始非計政之一道耳、</p>
<p>因行鹽而有區域、因杜私而别捐稅、然毘鄰之地、輕稅重稅、所緣以爲界者、一山一河之隔、傾銷鄰私、自又不免、故鹽稅輕重、又於其行鹽毘鄰之處、而分别平衡之焉、全國產額最多者、莫過淮鹽、行鹽之區域、亦最廣、爲湘鄂皖贛四省、謂之四岸、其稅率亦最高、因之鄰私四岸者亦較多、今茲加稅、不及四岸、蓋以此也、至蘇五屬之行銷、幾及於工南全部、然以距離產鹽區域之遠近不同、敵私之程度各異、故其稅率亦分數等、</p>
<p>（一）腹地、（即私銷不易至、又非隣淮之區故稅率較重、）如蘇錫上南川等七處、</p>
<p>（二）邊地、（即隣近淮銷、淮鹽易於侵入之區、故稅率略輕、）如常州鎭江等、</p>
<p>（三）特别區、（即淮鹽與浙鹽並銷之區、故淮浙同稅、）如常陰沙、</p>
<p>（四）减地、（即私鹽所易至之區、特爲减價敵私者、）如上南川之减地、寳山結一結九兩圖、啓東及上海租界浦東等地、惟减地之稅率、仍少有等次、</p>
<p>至於稅率定額、腹地初爲毎擔正稅兩元五角、巡緝費每擔七角、（按巡緝本由商辦、迨稽核所成立、併入行政、於是加征七角、巡緝由稽核所辦理、）所謂三元二角區是也、惟民十六後、曾　　稅軍事費二元五角、又地方整理善後用費一元、敎育及慈善用費一角、最近又加鎊虧三角、故實際每擔所付之正附稅、合爲七元角、在鹽政方面之立塲觀之、地方整理敎育善舉、不在國稅之列、故此次財部加稅表、列爲六元、此爲蘇五屬稅率之最重者、故此次未爲增加、</p>
<p>邊地正稅、視腹地减五角、合每擔二元、加巡緝費七角、爲二元七角、即此次增稅表所謂二元七角區是也、其餘負擔與腹地一律實繳正附稅、每擔六元六角、此次加稅、每擔一角、</p>
<p>减地在前清本屬無稅之地、光緒末年、始徵輕稅、謂爲减地正稅、初爲每担一元後加五角、其他附稅巡緝、一律减半、惟常陰沙則以淮浙並銷之故、視减地之稅重、視腹地之稅輕、又微有不同、即以减地論、啓東最輕、上南川寳山結、結九圖、又視上海租界浦東爲略輕、所高下者固不多、而其定稅率之輕重、蓋完全以敵私爲標準、此次常金沙加一元四角五分、啓東加一元、上南川寳山結一結九圖加一元三角、上海租界浦東分加一元四角五分、一元二角五分、兩等、</p>
<p>综合觀之、蘇五屬行鹽區域、除地方附加外、曩最高者每担六元、最低者一元九角、加稅後、最高者仍爲六元、最低者二元九角、而租界則自三元零五分、三元二角五分、而加至四元二角、四元五角、差額較前爲略少、蓋亦均稅辦法之初步也、</p>
<p>鹽旣不能無稅、稅又不能不分等率、欲圖整理、援用均稅之原則、固亦不失爲過渡中之一辦法、惟是鹽政向有成語、曰（高價招私、）（减稅敝私、）今之均稅、旣非减重稅之鹽、而係加輕稅之鹽、則標本兼舉、一面高價、一面應亟圖敵私之方法、庶有濟乎、</p>
<p>敵私無過於巡緝、巡緝今歸稽核所經理、名曰稅警、微聞此次整理鹽政、一方分加鹽稅、一方力節開支、所省擬至三分之一、然稅警如亦照减三分之一、其力量必　薄弱、私銷自必更因鹽價之高、可多獲利而大盛、其結果鹽稅雖高、鹽價雖貴、然以私運充斥之競爭、恐其所得總數、未心能有增益、即國庫未必能多收入、故加稅應與緝私同時積極辦理、方收成效、其理至明、深願關心鹽政者、一注意之、庶不至於虚負此舉也、</p>

<p>匝句以還、廢兩改元之聲、甚　塵上、崇論宏　之批露報端者、不一而足、對於此一原則、大抵異口同聲、表示贊成、惟間有顧慮辦法之是否適當、時機之是否成熟、而請求從長考量者、經與對於廢兩改元問題、原則上無不贊同、惟環觀國家政治問題複維、社會經濟情形之衰弱、在在有研究之價値、老慮之餘地、一旦若貿然施行、後患何堪設想、况此項廢兩改元之說、提倡已久十餘年來、迭經金融界之建議、著名學者之鼓吹、迄未實現、其中癥結、不言可喻、經熊曾於本月十九日、在申報夾件欄内、發表平議一則、詳加論述、始終認爲此項問題、應有愼重之討論、精密之考慮也、乃最近馬寅初博士之大文出、吾人方以爲得當世經濟學泰斗如博士者之一言、必有以啟迪羣衆、予廢兩改元前途莫大之助力、乃拜讀全文、悉置辦法與時機於不問、惟斷斷於資難錢莊、斥爲不顧大局、爰不揣固　、本質疑間難之發、略述實見、惟博士有以敎正焉、博士謂、（改元之動機、事有凑巧、一方鑒於歷來幣制之大紛亂、一方鑒於洋厘暴跌云云、又謂、一洋厘旣一再跌落、於是握有成色較高之銀元者、不如溶之爲銀、云云、又謂、（今能溶去其一部分雜色銀元、反可漸趨一致）、云云、綜其大旨、無非認洋厘跌價、良幣溶毁、爲廢兩改元之好機會、此實近於市　投機之思想、考厘價之所以跌落、乃由於目下銀幣所具實値、與面値相差過鉅之故、慨自通商以來、全國日常用品、幾盡仰給外國、而一切貨物、皆以銀兩爲定價標準、近因城市金融停滞、内地經濟枯竭、所有各行、平時用種種方法、推行各地之紙幣、重復集中滬埠、或償還貨欵、或購辦貨物、勢不得不以元易兩、乃以硬幣成色低次與軟幣數量充斥之結果、遂演成今日厘價暴落之現象、然則改元步驟、當然應以統一軟硬幣爲前提、必先設定良好成色之硬幣、一而謀軟幣發行之集中準備之充實、而後始可以言改、庶物價不致因紙幣劣幣之充斥而狂漲、社會經濟與平民生計、不致因物價之狂漲而受嚴重之影響、且博士文中、已承認近來所溶化者、爲成色較高之幣、所存留者、乃成色低次之幣、然則此項存留之次幣、豈足以當代替銀兩標凖之任、果如所言、則上海以及全國、不將成爲次幣本位耶、此種投機式之改元辦法、是豈賢明政府所欲採納、而著名經濟學者所認爲合理者乎、此應請指敎者一、　　博士推論洋厘暴洛之原因、不外（一）農村經濟衰落、（二）都市資金集中、（三）金融委節失常、（四）城市工商業衰落、（五）現金鉅額貯藏、（六）内地匪禍頻仍、而對於目下大宗新幣實値之僅及六錢八分五、置而不問、輕重未免倒置、要知上列六項原因、皆受政治方面影響所致、政治果上軌道、財政果有辦法、則上述六因、皆可使之消滅、幣制自可進而統一、夫廢兩改元、僅屬幣制上一部分問題、時機一到、人民且自動實施之不暇、决不待政府之督促、今博士舍本逐末、豈以爲廢兩改元成功之後、上述六因、皆可迎刃而解歟、此應請博士指敎者二、</p>
<p>各地銀兩、平色龐雜、隨寺而異、其爲統一幣制之障碍、誠難爲諱、特吾人所知、目下各行發行之紙幣、亦皆限於地域、不能流通全國、如上海之紙幣、不能携至漢口兌現、天津之紙幣、不能携到廣州使用、疆域各分、有如秦越、更有邊遠省分、如晉鈔、粤鈔·滇鈔·奉鈔·之濫發無度、不可收拾者、所在皆是、其爲統一幣制之障碍、寗輸銀兩、此發行制度之亟應先事整頓、彰彰明甚、若不此之務、而先着手廢兩改元、試問改元之後、是否能將上項障碍、一掃而盡、博士謂、孰先孰後、誰能下此斷語）、是何異但責建築師造屋、不責其爲先固基礎之謀乎、此應請指敎者三、</p>
<p>關於鑄造銀幣問題、在政府因無謀利之心、但處目前政治環境、能否使各省格守毋違、誰亦不能爲此下斷、卽使滬廠有工商界從旁監督、可不受京方政治勢力波及、其如各省造幣機器猶多存在何、且監督獨立公開等名詞、早已成爲　人工具、否則以二五基金保管委員會條例之嚴密、何以國債基金、猶有變更之事、此應請指敎者四、</p>
<p>又博士每論及廢兩改元、必集矢於錢莊、幾以錢</p>
<p>莊爲中便此舉之惟一罪人、此次並提出下列三項事實、認爲錢莊反對之原因、（一）一毫二忽半之利益、（二）同業存放、（三）銀行票據交換所成立、顧吾人遍考考業諸君迭次發表意見、並未有反對改元之說、惟見其請求先行統一造幣權、整頓發行制度、收回領判權、限制外國銀行吸收存欵、發行紙幣、並以平漢之前車爲誡、物價變化影響平民生計爲慮、是其所見者亦甚遠大、在今日政治狀况之下、似未可以𣏌憂目之、蓋發行銀行已</p>
<p>往之歷史、確有貽人口實之處、今後情形、尙須視政府監督能力如何而定、若謂懲前毖後、不致再蹈覆轍、則停兌一舉、固已數見不鮮、若謂現時舉行制度、决無他虞、則曩者平漢未停兌前、何嘗不以十足凖備爲號召、故邇來規定四六準備制之是否合理、（查發行凖備四六制、衆所共曉、而博士原文、謂現時發行凖備係七成現金三成保證、不知何據、）六成現金之是否確實、公開檢查辦法之是否適當、與夫怱促廢兩改元之後、如何使市面上卽時有相當成色之硬幣、可以應用、如何使發行紙幣者充實其凖備、其以曾經整理之債券、作四成保證準備者、如何保障其益臻鞏固、凡此種種、確應於廢兩改元以前深長計議、未可遽責錢業之鰓鰓過慮、再就博士堤出之三項原因而論、其第一項之一二五問題、連日已由錢業中人聲明爲業外人不明眞相之談、不値一晒、無待贅論、其第二項同業存放問題、實際與錢業亦殊無切庸利害之可言、緣同業存放、原預備銀行隨時提取、其存欵時間性之暫、較普通往來存欵、殆尤過之、且錢業亦非家家收受此類存欵、彼絶對不收此類存欵者、尙居多數、又况存放及收受與否、全以銀行與錢莊雙方之同意爲凖、銀行不願存放、錢業固不能强求、錢業不願收受、銀行亦豈能存放、如果銀行自願存放於錢莊、卽改元之後、何嘗不可辦理、且查目下此項下放、其中銀元數量、佔額爲巨、更可見存放固不限於銀兩、至謂錢莊有銀帳無洋帳之說、徵諸上述情形、尤屬無稽、按錢業已有百數十年之歷史、銀行業之發達、始於民國、若謂錢業必持銀行存放爲生、則未有銀行之前、錢業如何生存、此爲識者所知、可毋庸詞費、至其第三項所指票據交換所一事、錢業尤無反對之理、蓋票據交換所、本應合上海華洋金體銀錢業而組織、果有良好辦法、初不待廢兩改元之後、而始實現、在未产曾廢兩之前、未嘗不可組織、其所以遲遲未能成立者、仍在於銀行業内部組織之各個不同、例如一休假耳、甲行則停三天、乙行二天、丙行一天、工行照常營業、皇皇廣告、時見報上、卽此一端、從可推想、設使銀行業果能統一、而交換所能組織成立、則錢業自亦可以加入、根據上述三項事實、皆與廢兩改元問題、涉不相涉、錢業决不至因此而表示反對、意者博士别有用意、故爲此說　衆聽耶、此應請指數者五、</p>
<p>又博士謂、（錢業以銀兩一旦廢除、籌碼將感缺乏、爲反對理由、實屬毫無意識、云云、並以兩碗水合併爲一、其量始終、不變爲喻、查錢業並未反對廢兩改元、備如上述、其顧慮籌碼缺乏者、正恐硬的不敷、將以不充實之軟的代之、致經濟組織爲之崩潰耳、祇須保障硬的成色準備確、軟的凖備十足、其疑自釋、鑒之二碗水合併爲一、雖其量可相等、而水之質地容有不同、事先未經化騐、安可貿然合併、致飲者不適其口、以博士之明、所見寗不及此、此應請指敎者六、</p>
<p>要之銀兩之應廢除、殆已成爲天經地義、不特此也、卽現行銀幣、銀角·銅元·之應改革、亦已公認爲急要之圖、惟改革必須有澈底辦法、未可草率從事、或枝枝節節而出之、苟有澈底辦法、隨時皆可實行、固不必問釐價之跌與不跌也、</p>
<p>博士學識文章、萬流景仰、一言一動、皆是爲國人楷式、故吾人深願博士對此問題、更爲進一步之研究、對於銀錢之内容、更爲進一步之認識一面對政治環境、社會現狀、平民生計、更爲詳細之考察、庶學理事實、雙方兼顧、然後發爲文章、必大有助於全國經濟組織之改善、似遠勝於爲一部人求出路爲得計、經熊本習法學、對於經濟原理、素少心得、惟根據學理及事實方面、有不得不言者、故敢在未施行之前、不惜費詞詳論、以供社會之研究、冀得良好之結果、質之博士以爲如何、</p>

<h3>人造的紅色顏料</h3>
<p>— 存櫻樓</p>
<p>我們普通研究化學，常會發見以數種絶不相同的化學原料，祇須在一種相當的定量下施以化合作用，立刻會變成另外一種物質，如輕二養爲水，綠化納爲鹽，此種神秘莫测的現象，實在是我們喜歡從事化學工藝者最感興趣的事，例如關於一般顏料，我國國畫上所用的紅顏色一項，大都取之於天然的質料，像朱紅色是用硃砂製成的，胭脂紅色是用紅藍花或蘇木製成的，赭紅色是用赤鐵鑛製成的，但是如調合不很得法，其色素往往不能十分正確，惟有用化學原料配合製成的顏料，只要把幾種原料的質量配合得當，那是比較天然的顏料要正確而鮮明得多咧。</p>
<p>紅顏色的種類很多，聽說最近德國化學染色技師已發見紅色有百數十種之多，不過普通所謂紅色，大槪可以分爲深紅色，大紅色，和赭紅色三種，其他如桃紅橙紅粉綘紅等等，大	多可以摻入他種色料調合而成，所以本篇所述，擬即就以上三種先行介紹於讀者。</p>
<p>（一）深紅色深紅色的配合原料是亞琉酸蘇達ＳｏｄｉｕｍＳｕｌｐｈｉｔｅ二份，鹽化銻ＨｙｄｒｏｃｈｌｏｒｉｃＡｎｔｉｍｅｎｙ三份，調合的方法是把亞琉酸蘇達和盬化銻分别放置在瓷器内，用清水把二物溶解成爲液體，然後把二種溶液混合在一處，亞琉酸蘇達與鹽化銻立刻發生一種化合作用，變成深紅色的質料，而漸漸下沉於器皿的底部，等到紅質完全沉下時，可以把上面的水倒去，再用清水攪洗一二次，使其雜質浮起，到那時候就把含有雜質的水除去，把沉澱在下的紅色質料倒在紙上使餘液濾清，再放在太陽光下把他矖乾，就成功深紅色的顏料，可供應用了。</p>
<p>（二）大紅色大紅色就是朱紅色，他的配合原料是苛性鉀ＣａｕｓｔｉｃＰｏｔａｓｓｉｕｍ八份，硫磺花ＦｌｏｗｅｒｓｏｆＳｕｌｐｈｕｒ三份，汞Ｍｅｒｃｕｒｙ一份半，調合的方法是先把硫磺花（即硫磺之結晶粉末）研成極細的粉，放在篩裏面把粗粒篩去，然後把細末放在瓷器内，拿汞來把他調合在一處，再用方法把他磨研攪和，成爲一種（飽和溶液），這時候硫磺花與汞即化合而成黑色的質料，等了一回再把苛性鉀溶化在水内合成液體，復把此液倒在瓷器内與硫磺花和汞調合，倒在鍋子裏用文火把他漸漸燒熱，熱度大槪相當於華氏寒暑表百度左右，約數分鐘就變成大紅色的顏料，鮮明無比，不過在燒時要注决熱度不可太高，否則恐將變成暗黑的絳紅色。</p>
<p>（三）赭紅以赭紅色即赤黄色，他的配合的原料是鹽酸ＨｙｄｒｏｃｈｌｏｒｉｃＡｃｉｄ四份，在硫化銻ＡｎｔｉｍｏｎｙＴｒｉｓｕｌｐｈｉｄｅ七份，調合的方法是先把鹽酸和一點清水，放在鍋子裏用文火漸漸的把他燒熱，燒的時間可在一小時左右，然後把三硫化銻倒在鍋子裏使他和鹽酸調合在一起，等到鹽酸和三硫化銻完全混合後，再把他放在氣爐上蒸煑，大槪不到三小時便成功赭紅色的顏料了，關於三硫化銻，普通都拿綠化銻溶解在酸類中，再把硫化輕氣通入即成，還有用自然產生的輝安鑛（即銻硫鑛）Ｓｔｉｂｎｉｔｅ的，其效能完全相同。</p>
<p>學堂寫眞</p>
<h3>發薪</h3>
<p>— 韻</p>
<p>首都Ｔ大學的發薪，待遇有兩種·，一是高級敎員派校役送到，一是低級敎職員發通知任其自取。一般低級敎職員如助敎助理，推而至於庶務會計連茶房齋夫一起在内，人數總有二三百號。會計處起初爲一所辦公室式佈置，後來不知怎的，變了銀行辦事化，兩間房裏擺長櫃台正迎窗口，領薪水的人好比到銀行取欵，郵政局送信。</p>
<p>一時間這銀行辦理處化的會計處擠了三四層人，其中自然是有齋夫有茶房，有助理和跟班娘姨式的助敎先生，這大約是欠薪有三月之久，一般被窮所驅使的助敎助理，雖然夾在齋夫一夥拿錢而卑鄙先生的人格·，但到現在他由學生而先生，已經顧不到這一層，也擠在這一夥來領薪了。好似待賑的飢民，眉眼裏已經藏不了急迫而使不露之於外。</p>
<p>原來發薪的消息是在三天前，已有露出，這消息是由一位Ａ科助理走漏出來，Ａ科助理原是小學敎師，因得Ｎ敎授的信任，提拔到這裏，薪水由三十而八十，平時對會計處連絡很好，所以會計處的發薪消息，能由他傳出，許多的窮敎授，起碼貨的講師和跟班娘姨式的助敎，因此一點也都願意聯絡他。他因銀洋專電價而增高地位，同時敎授的（讀書價）不由的低下來了。</p>
<p>這天校中是停課第三日，终日埋頭或挾書亂跑的敎員先生們，此時一變而爲無聊，乏味，掃興，附近小館不好意思再到，連夫子廟聽大鼓，也屬萬不可能，附校的左右兜圈子，圈子已直厭，無聊之極，祗有心中的希望，希望最近期内發薪。</p>
<p>果然希望到，恩光北至，喜氣南來。眞個發薪了！所以這銀行化的會計處，一時間擠了這三四層人。</p>
<p>Ｌ敎授，從小就由官費留學養尊處優慣的，談到錢的一字，總不免覺得有一點卑俗化。然而他這時像三點鐘後等最後消息的編輯先生一樣的着急，到了薪水消息方才由Ｔ助理走漏出來的時候，他也再不能耐，就托Ｌ竟自就向會計處領取。因爲，門口的上海銀行四點鐘要關門，遲一點就來不及匯到家子婆的平袋中。</p>
<p>Ｗ講師Ｌ助敎Ｙ助敎一夥七八個人，都隨Ｔ助理急急忙忙的到會計處來。會計處的生意好，會計主任　　　經理架子十足。幸虧Ｔ和他有點交情，隨時發下。不然照規矩，要拿個牌子，先做號數代表的人類，取銷你的敎員資格。　　一會兒Ｌ敎授Ｎ敎師Ｗ助敎｀｀｀｀｀｀七八個人到了附近小館子裏，老閶笑逐顏開，Ｔ助敎望他嘆一口冷氣，暗暗道，這算是唯一的安慰。</p>
<p>性的問題</p>
<h3>肉的回憶</h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>友人吳君四塊錢買一個Ｋｉｓｓ口涎流到背上。這一個笑話，我老早便聽了無數遍了。今天我偶然的遇着他，我特意的請敎了這一笑話的來源。以下便是他所要告訴我的·，</p>
<p>（朋友，你知道而且你該懂得·，一個青年男子當他的妻不在身邊的時候，尤其是那桃花滿樹的氣節，他要制止自已，完全不使之犯罪，那恐怕是十分困難的吧？老實說·，我生理上需要性的調劑，恕我不能再有努力支持的能力，何况在這私有制度之下，連女人也是商品的時候，然而因爲缺乏錢的原因，我還能由桃花時節一直支持到姑娘少婦們僅以輕紗蔽體極力使我們男人瘋狂的夏天。　　一個奇熱的晚上，我有意讓我自已消磨在電影院的電風扇的吹拂之下，那銀幕上的接吻擁抱使我沉醉於幻想中。你知道，前後左右都是一對一對的情人包圍着，她們在髮鬚撕磨的輕言細語，同時我也模糊認出了在我貼近的身旁有一個外國女郎·，她敝着胸懷，露着手臂，｀｀｀｀｀於是我暈迷，我繚亂，我爲這一切的誘惑所懾服了。然而銀幕上仍是緊緊地吮着嘴唇，情人們仍在切切的往還耳語。</p>
<p>其後我覺着那外國女郎在一寸一寸的移近我坐來，我懂得這個意思，於是我也膽大的貼近她坐去，當然她没有拒絶我的意思，以致於使我更加壯膽了。我覺着了她的體温，我也聞着了她的肉香。朋友，你一定懂得這時的我是如何的興奮了。我的心在狂跳，	我的血在奔騰。加之那女人有意的幾次向我微笑，而且吐着紙烟向我臉上噴來。這時魔鬼攫住了我的心靈，居然使我勇敢的握着她的手了。｀｀｀｀｀當然，我不顧一切，我只知道她是女人，她是我所需要的女人、其餘一切誰還管得著呢？</p>
<p>不	久，我們便挽著手走出了電影院，她隈依在我的胸前。在向她家駛去的汽車中，她緊執著我的手用著熱情的調子然而是不純熟的英語對我說··</p>
<p>（Ｙｏｕ　ｌｏｖｅ　ｍｅｐ）</p>
<p>（Ｙｅｓｗ，Ｉｌｏｖｅ　ｙｏｕｌ　ｍｙ　ｄｅａｒｌ）　　於是她突然的欠起身來抱著我的頭頸狂吻，熱情的，長時間的，吻著，吮著，簡直換不過氣來。因爲當時我是仰著的原故，她的口涎也是我的口涎由我的嘴角流到血頰，再由面頰一直流到背上。）</p>
<p>（啊！）我不禁嘻笑著說··（好熱烈的Ｋｉｓｓ啊！）</p>
<p>其後我的友人吳君又接著說··（不過以後我知道了她是賣淫婦，一個白色俄婦，理智告訴我，我决不能將高價購買梅毒，於是我留下四塊錢，决然的離開了她的庽所。然而，朋友！她的温唇，她的手臂直到現在還留在我的記憶中哩）。</p>
<p>空有专理</p>
<h3>溺愛的結果</h3>
<p>— 一萍</p>
<p>Ｍ在我們校裏有交際家之名，身上穿着很講究的西裝··臉袋兒生得也漂亮，校裏的無論什麽聚會，Ｍ像藥料裏甘草一樣不可缺少，就因爲他交際的手腕，我們變次談話，就成莫逆。</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>他家裏只母子兩人，Ｍ還在他母親四十多歲時養的、當然晚年得子，喜歡異常，父親死後，他母親更溺愛他，因爲父親在營業上賺過巨欵，母子的生活，舒適得很。</p>
<p>有時星期日，約幾個朋友到家裏去，總飯菜，點心應酬得很周到，Ｍ母親的心理，怕Ｍ放假日出去遊玩，被歹朋友带壞了他，能到他家裏玩玩胡琴，甚至打幾圈麻將，不勝歡迎之至。</p>
<p>Ｍ的交際手腕畢竟不弱，畢業後不多時，社會上已有他的小小聲名，報張上，什麽會，大有非他不歡之槪，我呢，爲了生活問題，自鑽營出路，我們的交遊遂疏，後來想託他一點事，我到玩胡琴的故居Ｍ已鳳去樓空，據新主人說，Ｍ因故居不敷應用，另覓新居，也是凑巧歸途在某邨里口遇着Ｍ的母親和我相背的方向呆望，本來很康健的老人家，已蒼老不堪，滿首銀髮飄飄，我呌了聲伯母，她似乎一驚，然後免强笑着說（張先生），好入不見了，遇着我們阿進（Ｍ的乳名）嗎？她並邀入一所新宅，裏面裝飾比從前講究藲，僕人送過茶後，她告訴我·，（Ｍ自畢業後，终日遊蕩，晚上至早也要十句鐘歸來，我每天總在門口望他幾回，問問他不是某要人，便是某聞人請客，前天還有有個女子來找他，張先生你可以勸勸他嗎？你們從前是好朋友啊，）我看她行止語氣已愛子成疾，胡亂安慰她幾句。</p>
<p>不滿一個月，接到Ｍ的一張敬請觀禮的紅帖，一個名交際家手婚禮，當然羣賢畢至，舊同學到的也不少，Ｍ的母親更喜氣洋洋，招等賓客，這一天，哄哄閙閙，直到午夜三時。</p>
<p>於是Ｍ的名聲更大，由交際家一躍而爲海上聞人。</p>
<p>當我第二次去訪他的時候，他的老母已重病在床，見了我好像要招呼而若已開不出口，病榻旁除幾個女僕外，Ｍ的舅父掛着兩行清涙對我說（家姊辛苦了一世，對於阿進怎樣寳貝，你們朋友總曉得的，可是他結婚以後，就搬出去，現在老太太將死，還没有找到他｀｀｀｀｀）Ｍ的舅父已泣不成聲。</p>
<p>一個男僕氣急敗壞的跌進來，（老｀｀｀爺，到新公館去，阿福說和少奶奶赴某科長的茶無會去，我再探了某科長的　住址，趕去那門房說剛剛和科長，太太，一同兜風去了，）</p>
<p>老太太忽然慘呌一聲駕返瑤池。</p>
<p>（名交際家的太夫人逝世，這消息恐怕又將震動上海··將來開吊，了喪，死後風光更盛極一時吧？）我在路上這樣想。</p>

<h3>Studying the Development of the Northwest</h3>
<p>I still remember this time last year. We made multiple commentaries, urging our countrymen to urgently study the Northeast. Within two months, disaster struck. The black mountains and white waters changed their color. Only a year has passed, and the country is becoming more hopeless by the day. The land is fragmented, and enemy cavalry roam freely. Looking north, one cannot help but feel saddened and unsure where to direct one's tears.</p>
<p>The ruin of the Northeast further proves the seriousness of our country's border problems. The Northeast is now under the thumb of the Japanese, and a puppet regime has been firmly established. Before the lost territory is recovered, we cannot study it even if we wanted to. Moreover, there are frequent warnings and looming crises in the Rehe area. Shadowy signs are everywhere. Who dares to say that this time next year, the Northwest border will not experience a tragic event similar to the September 18th Incident of last year? Learning from past mistakes and taking measures to prevent further losses, we now dare to urge our countrymen to urgently study the Northwest and, more importantly, to plan for its development. The Northwest we are referring to now specifically includes Shaanxi, Ningxia, Suiyuan, Gansu, Xinjiang, and Qinghai. This vast plain surrounding our Northwest border can be considered a national bulwark or a natural treasure trove. However, under the watchful eyes and incitement of powerful neighbors, Outer Mongolia has already become independent, and Tibet has also seceded. Other regions such as Qinghai, Ningxia, and Xinjiang provinces have little contact with the people of the interior due to different customs and habits. Transportation is hindered, and the situation deteriorates daily. The concept of national and ethnic identity may be very weak in these areas, and they may even rely on powerful neighbors for protection. Once an emergency occurs, the disaster will be irreversible. This bulwark that protects our country has already been dismantled, even though it has not been physically removed. As for resources, the soil is fertile and suitable for cultivation. Forests and animal husbandry are also suitable. The main raw materials for industry, such as iron, coal, and oil, are extremely abundant. The gold production in areas such as Qilian, Altai, and Yerkent is also world-renowned. However, these natural riches remain undeveloped, buried underground. Treasures fill the fields, but no one knows how to extract them. Fertile fields are half-ruined. This so-called treasure trove is as good as non-existent to us. If we possess treasures but do not know how to use them, we will inevitably attract the covetousness of powerful neighbors. The borders are not secure, the bulwark is completely dismantled, and if an emergency occurs, we will not be able to spread the news throughout the country as quickly as we did during the Northeast disaster. Why? Because transportation in the Northwest is hindered, the situation is isolated, and it is far less convenient and the information is far slower than in the Northeast.</p>
<p>In recent years, the call to develop the Northwest has been growing louder. Those who have gone to the Northwest for on-site inspections include the Northwest Scientific Expedition and the Western Border Academic Expedition. Recently, many ambitious individuals have established organizations dedicated to studying Northwest issues. The Longhai Railway Bureau will also specially invite those with aspirations to conduct on-site inspections of the Northwest. We sincerely hope that this work can move from mere talk to practical action. We further hope that our countrymen will learn from the past losses in the Northeast, pool their wisdom and efforts, and work together to promote development, so as to strengthen our borders and open up our resources.</p>
<p>National News</p>
<h3>Central Government Urges Zhang Xueliang to Aid Rehe</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan's meeting decides to telegraph Tang Yulin to resist.</p>
<p>In diplomacy, plans to protest to Japan and appeal to the League of Nations</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to reports received from a certain source, Chaoyang has fallen. It is heard that the Central Government urgently telegraphed Zhang Xueliang to swiftly dispatch capable troops to rescue the Central Government, providing support to the best of its ability. However, Zhang has not yet responded to this telegram. (21st dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Xueliang in Beiping and Tang Yulin in Chengde both sent telegrams reporting the events of Chaoyang on the 20th. Foreign diplomatic corps also received a telegram from Beiping about Chaoyang. The government telegraphed the Chinese representative to the League of Nations to report to member states and telegraphed Jiang Zuobao to lodge a protest. As for the rumors of returning to the capital for a military meeting, they are denied. Li Jishen may have to go to Beiping first. (21st dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Xueliang sent successive telegrams to the Executive Yuan, Military Council, and General Staff Headquarters on the morning of the 21st, relaying Tang Yulin's reports on the Japanese army's reconnaissance of Rehe. Chengde is currently peaceful. The situation near Beipiao and Chaoyang has deteriorated. Please provide instructions. Wang Jingwei invited Li Jishen, He Yingqin, Zhu Peide, and others again this evening to discuss countermeasures and telegraphed Chiang Kai-shek for consultation. (21st)</p>
<h3>Executive Yuan Held Talk Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) On the 19th, the Japanese army sent planes to Chaoyang to drop bombs, injuring more than 30 of our compatriots and more than 20 horses. The Executive Yuan received a telegram from the Beiping Pacification Headquarters on the morning of the 20th reporting the incident. Premier Wang, in order to plan for resistance, specially summoned Foreign Minister Luo Wengan, General Staff Zhu Peide, and Military Deputy Chen Yi to the No. 1 official residence of the Ministry of Railways in the afternoon to discuss the matter. However, military plans were not discussed because He Yingqin had not returned from Shanghai. After He returned to Nanjing on the 21st, Wang immediately summoned him to the Yuan at 9 o'clock, asking about the progress of bandit suppression in the three provinces and informing him of the results of the previous day's discussions. At 9:30, Luo Wengan was summoned to the Yuan again to hold a talk. In addition to Wang, Luo, and He, Executive Yuan Secretary-General Chu Minyi also participated. Regarding military matters, it was decided to urgently telegraph Chairman Tang Yulin of Rehe to resist and telegraph the Military Council to immediately order Director Zhang Xueliang of the Beiping Pacification Headquarters to send a large army to assist Tang in preparing for resistance. Regarding diplomatic matters, it was decided to: (1) lodge a protest with Japan; (2) inform the League of Nations of the recent invasion of Rehe by the violent Japanese. Other policies were also discussed. (21st dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) During the temporary meeting of the Executive Yuan the day before yesterday, a certain minister angrily said, "If we continue to embrace the policy of non-resistance, we should all resign at the same time." On the evening of the 21st, Wang's banquet also discussed this matter. It is heard that it was decided at the meeting that, in addition to telegraphing Zhang to actively resist, a detailed telegram would also be sent to the League of Nations' investigation team, requesting Gu Weijun to forward it. The development of this matter depends on the receipt of Zhang's reply before a concrete decision can be made. (21st dispatch)</p>
<h3>Peace in Beiping, Tianjin, Rehe, and Yu</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Beiping Pacification Headquarters' Beijing Office received a reply telegram from Bao Wenwei, stating that Beiping, Tianjin, Rehe, and Yu are peaceful and that external rumors are not credible. Furthermore, according to the office, Zhang Xueliang reported the Chaoyang incident in a telegram of more than a thousand words to the Executive Yuan, as reported in today's newspapers. The office has not yet received this telegram, so the rumors about Chaoyang cannot be confirmed.</p>
<p>(21st dispatch)</p>
<h3>Zhang Xueliang Has Not Expressed His Position</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) It is heard that Wang Jingwei sent a detailed telegram to Chiang Kai-shek, seeking his opinion. It is heard that Zhang sent three telegrams over the past two days reporting on the situation in Rehe, all of which were based on Tang Yulin's reports and requesting instructions from the Central Government. Zhang himself did not express any position. (21st dispatch)</p>
<h3>Tang Yulin Sends People to Chaoyang</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Seeing that the Northeast Army was prepared, the Japanese army attacking Rehe feared suffering casualties in vain and giving the investigation team a bad impression. The Rehe representative in Shenyang requested the Japanese army to stop military action, and the Japanese army headquarters agreed. Tang then sent Shao Zifeng, the president of the Beipiao Chamber of Commerce, to Chaoyang Temple on the 20th to contact Captain Harada. The situation is temporarily easing. (21st dispatch)</p>
<h3>Initial Circumstances of the Japanese Army's Invasion of Rehe</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to a certain source, the Japanese army in Jinzhou, under the pretext of the so-called "Ishimoto Incident," launched an attack on Rehe. According to reports received by the government, there is no such person as Ishimoto. It is evident that this is purely a false accusation by the Japanese to use as a pretext for launching an attack, just like the Nakamura Incident and the September 18th Incident. The situation at that time was as follows: At 1:00 PM on the 17th, a train from Beipiao to Jinzhou was intercepted by bandits south of Nanling. Our side led a team to suppress the bandits. When they arrived south of Chaoyang Temple, they saw a Japanese armored vehicle rushing into Chaoyang Temple. Commander Zhang of our side went forward to question them. However, the Japanese army, without asking any questions, immediately opened fire on our troops. Our army then retaliated and resisted. According to another report, the Japanese army, under the pretext that a Japanese person had been kidnapped by bandits, forcibly entered Rehe. Commander Zhang of our side telegraphed to stop them, but it was ineffective. They opened fire at 1:00 PM on the 21st and resisted for two hours. Commander Zhang was hit by a bullet in the leg and continued to resist in Nanling. According to another report, on the morning of the 18th, Commander Zhang was still north of Chaoyang Temple, confronting the Japanese army. A Japanese plane flew from Beipiao over Chaoyang Temple, flying very low and carrying bombs. It flew back after about thirty to forty minutes. According to a telegram from Director Zhang in Beiping, he has already telegraphed the front to make thorough preparations and make every effort to resist. (21st dispatch)</p>
<h3>Military Staff College Will Draft Another Plan</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain authority in the Military Staff College stated that since the September 18th Incident, the college had drafted a plan to resist Japan and submitted it to the National Government for adoption. Afterwards, it also contributed to the plan to suppress bandits, as suppressing bandits is also a way to resist Japan. If we cannot pacify the interior, how can we resist foreign aggression? Now that the Japanese army is attacking Rehe again, the details are not yet known. If they are truly implementing their consistent policy of aggression, we must make every effort to resist in order to preserve the survival of our country and nation and to protect the integrity of our territory. Matters have come to this point, and the fate of the nation is at stake. We should no longer delay and should respond with national unity in order to seek a way out. The college has paid special attention to this matter and will draft another plan for resistance for adoption. (21st dispatch)</p>
<h3>Zhu Jiqing Discusses the Ishimoto Incident</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhu Jiqing stated that it was expected that the Japanese army in Jinzhou would send planes to bomb Chaoyang. However, it is still unknown whether the Ishimoto incident occurred. They are now using it as a pretext to attack Rehe. Their intention is simply to carry out intimidation tactics to force Rehe to submit. As for how the incident will escalate, I dare not make a judgment. (21st dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to a certain important figure from Rehe in Tianjin, we do not know whether there is such a person as Ishimoto or whether the disappearance actually occurred. We can only rely on the Japanese's one-sided propaganda, and there is no way to verify it. Even if there is such a person and he is disguised as a Chinese person and enters a bandit-ridden area without requesting protection beforehand, he is to blame for any accidents that occur. The local military police cannot be held responsible. (21st dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army's Invasion of Rehe is a Probe</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese army's current invasion of Rehe is intended to probe our attitude and the international situation. After attacking Chaoyang on the 18th, we maintained calm, and all countries were shocked. Their cunning plan ultimately failed. The Rehe border has been quite peaceful for the past two days. The Japanese army in the Yixian area has not taken any active actions. The situation is gradually easing. (21st dispatch)</p>
<h3>He Zhuguo Arrived in Beiping Yesterday to Meet Zhang</h3>
<p>(Beiping) He Zhuguo arrived in Beiping this morning to meet Zhang and report on the defense of Yuguan. (21st dispatch)</p>
<h3>Most of the Japanese Army is Concentrated in Yixian</h3>
<p>(Beiping) A person from Rehe stated that most of the Japanese army is concentrated in Yixian. Several soldiers went to Beipiao the day before yesterday and wanted to set up a inspection post. They were told that bandits were everywhere and left. The Japanese will not be able to complete their ambition to invade and occupy the Northeast without Rehe. The route from Chao to Chengde is more than 900 li. If they enter Rehe, they must attack through Beipiao or Kailu. The terrain there is dangerous, and there are elite troops defending it. The people of Rehe are strong and brave, and even women can kill enemies. Therefore, the Japanese dare not advance lightly. (21st dispatch)</p>
<h3>No Unusual Movements of Japanese Troops Between Jin and Yu</h3>
<p>(Shanhaiguan) There are no abnormal movements of Japanese troops on the Jin-Yu line of the puppet railway. The garrison is still one regiment. Yuguan is very peaceful, and the people are also at peace. (21st dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Plane Crashes Due to Wind and Rain</h3>
<p>(Shanhaiguan) On the 19th, a Japanese plane from Jinzhou flew to Suizhong on the northeastern border for reconnaissance. It crashed and was damaged due to a storm and heavy rain. (21st dispatch)</p>
<h3>Only a Small Number of Japanese Troops on the Jin-Chao Line</h3>
<p>(Shanhaiguan) According to a certain source, the Japanese army on the Jin-Chao line is not very strong and is not taking any active actions. (21st dispatch)</p>
<h3>Reports of Battles in Beiping Newspapers</h3>
<p>(Beiping) This morning, the Chinese newspapers here reported in detail on the Chaoyang battle situation, stating that on July 17, 300 Japanese soldiers in two armored trains traveled from Yixian to a location near Chaoyang. After disembarking, without any prior warning, they suddenly attacked the Chaoyang Temple, where a battalion of Rehe soldiers was stationed. The Chinese soldiers were stationed here to suppress bandits. After being attacked, they resisted valiantly and repelled the Japanese soldiers. On the morning of the 18th, six Japanese planes flew over Chaoyang. Other planes arrived twenty miles from Chaoyang Temple in the afternoon and dropped thirty bombs, damaging twenty-seven of them. They then strafed the entire city with machine guns. This morning, the Chinese newspapers unanimously condemned the actions of the Japanese and urged the Chinese army to do its best to resist the Japanese army's invasion of Rehe. The Tianjin Ta Kung Pao stated that the Japanese army's invasion of Rehe was the beginning of the third stage of Japan's blatant war to occupy China. The Beiping newspapers stated that the Japanese newspapers all said that the Ishimoto case was the second Nakamura case, which proves that Japan has long harbored the ambition to seize Rehe.

<h3>British Newspaper Comments on the Rehe War</h3>
<p>(London) The London Times today published an editorial commenting on the Manchurian dispute and first focused on the Rehe war, saying that Tokyo believes this will not lead to a wide-ranging war, while Beiping claims that the Japanese, under the pretext of rescuing Ishimoto, have invaded the province. The Times acknowledges that the Japanese authorities are eager to restore security, but states that creating a new country administered by Japan, whose people are all foreigners and unfriendly, is a very difficult task. It is thought that Japanese soldiers must have foreseen this when they started. Tokyo's decision to separate Manchuria from China will present a very serious and difficult issue to the League of Nations General Assembly in September. Proper governance of Manchuria is indeed related to Japanese interests, and the Japanese should also have a full share in the development of Manchuria's economic resources, but the people of Manchuria have even greater rights to decide the form of their government, so this matter should be properly discussed with them now.

<h3>Huang Shao-xiong's Statement on the Truth of the Mackay Contract</h3>
<p>Publishing the Letter from Former Minister of Communications Chen Mingshu</p>
<p>Wang Chongzhi's Reckless Attacks Violate Discipline</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Huang Shao-xiong, because the Director of the International Telegraph Administration, Wang Chongzhi, has distorted the facts and recklessly attacked the Ministry of Communications' signing of the reporting contract and equipment purchase contract with Mackay Company, deeming it a violation of discipline, has specially published the entire background of this case and Chen Mingshu's reply to Huang to clarify the truth. The gist of Chen's letter to Huang is that the Ministry of Communications' signing of the reporting contract and telephone contract with the American Mackay Company has been carefully considered by the responsible personnel multiple times. A special declaration will be made on the legal issues, with the company fully responsible. These contracts do not involve any loss of rights and can prevent the malpractice of American joint-venture companies obtaining patents. Therefore, they were signed. The previous telegram to Division Chief Li Fanyi and Director of the International Telegraph Administration Wang Chongzhi were all supporters of this case. If they believe there are disadvantages and no benefits, they can terminate the signing at any time. Mingshu has absolutely no preconceptions. Unexpectedly, in the days since, Wang Chongzhi has wantonly propagated in various Chinese and foreign newspapers that these contracts are humiliating and detrimental to national sovereignty, and has made many slanderous remarks, focusing his attacks on Vice Minister Chen Fumu. He has used unfinished and unannounced matters within the Ministry to criticize and defame his superior. Even if these contracts are to be terminated, the slander has already become a great insult. I cannot allow my brother Fumu to suffer this insult and use my departed position to remove this responsibility. Therefore, I am making the original explanation to hope that you will examine whether these contracts have any shortcomings or disadvantages to determine whether or not to perform them, and to warn Wang Chongzhi. Furthermore, this reporting contract is to resist the patent of a certain company and also against the…</p>
<p>Because of the reporting contract, it is actually beneficial to our side. Why is it said to be humiliating and detrimental to national sovereignty? Huang also stated that the intention of signing the Mackay contract was, first, to prevent the patent of a joint-venture company, and second, to deal with the joint-venture company's unauthorized communication with the puppet organizations in the Northeast. It was found that the contract signed between the former Special Committee and the joint-venture company allowed all wireless telegrams sent to the United States, except for those with designated routes, to be sent through the joint-venture company's lines, originally intended to prevent monopoly. However, since the Northeast Incident, the Foreign Ministry has consistently declared its non-recognition of the puppet organizations, but the company has continued to communicate with the puppet organizations. Therefore, the Ministry of Communications resolutely signed another contract with Mackay to counter it. As for whether the joint-venture company will raise objections to this, it is a matter for the future, and it cannot be judged at this time that we will definitely be in a losing position. The current policy is to abolish unequal treaties. If this contract restricts our reporting services, it should be corrected as soon as possible and should not lose national dignity because of this. As for whether or not to purchase telephone equipment, it should be determined based on the needs of the country and, in particular, whether the Ministry's finances can bear the price. Currently, the Ministry is empty and feels unable to pay. Therefore, I intend to consider the purchase of equipment in terms of both needs and finances before proceeding. (21st)</p>

<h3>Papen's (Big Stick) Policy Succeeds</h3>
<p>The German Federal Government Controls the Police Power of Prussia</p>
<p>Fundamental Changes in the Administrative System Throughout History</p>
<p>All Former Prussian Officials Dismissed</p>
<p>Major Blow to Left-Wing Forces</p>
<p>Berlin Remains Under Siege</p>
<p>Central Government Declares Only Emergency Measures</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Berlin, 21st Dispatch Papen's (Big Stick) policy has fully succeeded in Prussia. There seems to be no doubt that it will go smoothly from now on, because Papen has many confidants in the army and police, replacing those disappointed elements who were dismissed by him. Furthermore, Papen knows that the verdict of the Supreme Court in Leipzig will not be issued for several weeks and will likely favor the Federal Government. The opposition parties now have no power or courage. Union leaders are now instructing the masses to strive for victory in the July 31st election. There is still one possible development: the Communist Party may be considered illegal. The party has a total of five million members. This morning, the party's Red Flag newspaper was not published. The newspaper</p>
<p>The police searched the museum and found a kind of leaflet intended to spread and incite people in the streets, which was then sealed up. Papen is not worried about the election now. He feels that no unified party can occupy an absolute majority in the parliament. Now giants such as Blanc and Severing have been removed from office, and smaller officials are also being purged, which is warmly supported by the National Socialist Party. Hitler's followers are all overjoyed because the party can now control Prussia without waiting for the voters' entrustment.</p>
<p>▲ National, Berlin, 20th Dispatch After the German President ordered the creation of a Prussian dictatorship, he continued to handle the work of removing the old and establishing the new tonight. All members of the old cabinet were dismissed. It is heard that the Federal Government will send Federal Administrative Commissioners to replace the heads of the various departments. The former Minister of the Interior, Schefferlin, after being coerced this evening, has already yielded and was not arrested. The newly appointed Administrative Commissioner, Black, will take over the Prussian Ministry of Interior tomorrow. The Chief of Police of Prussia, Glei-Shesky, the Deputy Chief of Police, Huai Aisi, and the Police Commander, Heimansburg, all refused to resign. After being arrested, they were detained in the Chief Officer's detention room of the Mosebiluk Army Prison. However, after the officials sent by the Federation completed the takeover, they were immediately released.</p>
<p>▲ National, Berlin, 20th Dispatch Regarding the German Federal Government's sudden appointment of Prussian Administrative Commissioners this time, some say that it is the Prime Minister, Baben, bowing to the National Socialist Party and the National Power Party. The various factions such as the Social Democratic Party took advantage of the weakness of the National Socialist Party in the Prussian Parliament and wanted to take advantage of the parliamentary deadlock where a new Prime Minister could not be elected to temporarily retain political power with a proxy cabinet, hoping to be in a superior position during the parliamentary elections and easier to recover their decline. The right-wing factions such as the National Socialist Party and the National Power Party also urgently wanted to overthrow the proxy cabinet before the election. The leaders of the two houses have repeatedly pointed out that Prussia is unable to quell the political turmoil within its borders and firmly requested the Federal Government to take stronger measures to intervene. The Federal Government has also recently seen the increasing political unrest in Prussia and the constant incidents in various places, and knows that unless the problem is radically resolved, it will inevitably expand. Therefore, it did not care about the constraints of the Constitution and used extraordinary means. Although this move is only a temporary emergency measure, it is actually the first major event in German political history since the promulgation of the Republican Constitution in 1919, containing two important meanings: First, the Federal Government has never had the direct power to command the police. Now, it has placed 90,000 Prussian police under the command of the Federal Government. Second, since the organization of the Federation in Germany in 1871, each state has retained its sovereignty in administration. Bismarck wanted to concentrate power in the center, but the time was not ripe. Although the Republic Constitution promulgated in 1919 increased the power of the center, most of the administrative power was still in the hands of the state governments. The Federal Minister of Interior could only use indirect methods, such as using finance to oppress the rebellious state governments. Now, the Federal Government has taken control of Prussia's administrative power. This is nothing short of a fundamental change in the principle of the administrative system throughout history. Although the Federal Government solemnly declared that this is only an emergency measure and will not change the system that has always been in place, having set this precedent, once the left-wing elements regain control of the Federal Government's political power, it will not be difficult to use this example to complete its great plan of unifying the country and centralizing power. Therefore, this move has profound implications.</p>
<p>▲ National, Berlin, 20th Dispatch Representatives of the Federal Government met with foreign reporters tonight to explain the government's attitude towards Prussia, saying that the announcement of the siege state in Berlin and Brandenburg was not a strategy to maintain治安 (public order) in these two places, but only to build an executive department so that the Federal Government could implement certain plans in Prussia. Once the senior Prussian officials are willing to obey the orders of the Federal Committee, the siege state will be suspended. The Federal Government hopes to suspend it before July 31st. Even if it cannot, the election will still be held on that day. The spokesperson tried his best to deny that the provisions of the emergency order regarding telegrams, telephones, and mail were intended to inspect various news items, and finally said that once the Prussian Parliament elects a Prime Minister in accordance with the legal majority, the overall situation in Prussia can be considered to have returned to normal.</p>
<p>▲ National, Berlin, 21st Dispatch The events in Berlin this morning made the people afraid that they would not even know that they were already in a declared siege state (i.e., an emergency situation, slightly different from martial law). The streets are as peaceful as usual, with no trace of soldiers. All political parties have also adopted a cautious attitude to avoid causing trouble. The headquarters of the National Socialist Party received the news on Tuesday and ordered the stormtroopers to avoid conflicts in the streets. Generally speaking, the people of Berlin have been able to quickly settle down in the new state. The shock that occurred to the left-wing yesterday receded faster than expected. Even the left-wing newspapers' rhetoric today shows a clear moderation, with a tendency to remain silent for the time being. Right-wing newspapers are of course joyful, regarding this as the first sound of cleansing work. However, although last night was the most peaceful evening in Berlin since the establishment of the Papen government, in the southern suburbs, 200 communists attempted to overturn a tram and a bus. The emergency team drove them away, avoiding a disaster. General Lun, commander of the Third Military District, who now holds the police power in Berlin, met with reporters today, saying that he will still adhere to the old plan of using only the police to quell disturbances, and will not mobilize troops unless absolutely necessary. He also denied that the declaration of the siege state infringed on the constitutional rights of Prussia. Today, union leaders have been summoned to Berlin by telegram. Although the Communist Party is clamoring for a general strike, it is heard that union leaders do not support this move and have advised their members to work as usual with peace of mind. The Social People's Party also held a meeting at its headquarters today to discuss response measures. It is heard that Prime Minister Papen will convene a new committee meeting tomorrow in his capacity as the Prussian Administrative Commissioner to discuss ways to protect the people from being harassed by the Communist Party. It is now believed that the most severe measures will be taken to deal with the Communist Party.</p>
<p>▲ National, Berlin, 21st Dispatch Berlin has returned to normal at 10:00 AM this morning. The street fights between the National Socialist Party and the Communist Party were the direct cause of the German President's decisive action this time. Now that the National Socialist Party has achieved its goal, it has stopped causing trouble. The police feel it is not easy to deal with the Communist Party. As of 10:00 AM this morning, more than 90 people have been arrested and charged with distributing leaflets inciting the workers of Berlin and Brandenburg to a general strike. In addition, the Communist Party's headquarters here was searched, and police were temporarily stationed there. The printing presses inside were also confiscated, so the Communist Party's Red Flag newspaper could not be published this afternoon.</p>
<h3>Draft Resolution on Disarmament Presented to the General Commission</h3>
<p>Czechoslovak Foreign Minister Elaborates Fully</p>
<p>Achievements of Five Months of Meetings Thus</p>
<p>No Concrete Regulations on Cannon Caliber Still</p>
<p>Political Issues Left for Future Discussion</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Geneva, 20th. Czechoslovak Foreign Minister Beneš today presented to the General Commission of the Disarmament Conference a report he had drafted after close collaboration and extensive discussions with representatives of the United States, Britain, France, and Italy. Before presenting it, Beneš explained that the report summarized the results achieved so far by the Disarmament Conference and also provided a plan for future deliberations. However, political issues such as security and equality would have to be left for future discussion. The report adopted the form of a resolution and declared in its preamble that the Disarmament Conference had agreed to substantially reduce existing land, sea, and air armaments, with the primary aim of reducing offensive weapons, in accordance with President Hoover's proposal. It then stated in the text that agreement had been reached on several points during the conference, and therefore it was decided to incorporate several concrete disarmament plans into the final convention. However, these plans would not hinder further and more far-reaching agreements in the future. Next, it listed various plans, such as prohibiting aerial bombardment of civilians, limiting the number of military aircraft, managing and supervising commercial aviation, limiting the tonnage of tanks and the caliber of cannons, and abolishing all chemical and bacteriological warfare. The report concluded by recommending the extension of the current suspension of the arms race until March 1 of next year, with the hope that the Disarmament Conference would then enter its second phase.</p>
<p>▲ Reuter, Geneva, 20th. The General Commission of the Disarmament Conference reconvened at 5:00 PM today. Before 5:00 PM, the gallery was already packed with people, but everyone was discussing the news from Berlin and Rome. The meeting officially began at 5:30 PM. Chairman Henderson rose to speak, and the entire hall listened attentively. Henderson explained the origins of the proposal and then invited the chief rapporteur, Czechoslovak Foreign Minister Beneš, to speak. Beneš gave a full explanation of the draft resolution, saying that it now melted the will of all parties and adopted a kind of reconciliation method. It was only with the spirit of common sacrifice that such a result could be achieved. The resolution incorporated the following important principles: (1) qualitative disarmament; (2) protection of ordinary people and properties with artistic and historical value; (3) consideration of advances in military technology; (4) implementation of inspection by a permanent committee to avoid another arms race. Beneš said that it was the first time that countries had bound each other with treaties on armaments issues. The work of the Disarmament Conference would not be completely over after this but would only be temporarily suspended for four months. The presidium and various specialized committees should continue to work. The presidium should draft resolutions on aerial bombardment, chemical warfare, and inspection issues. The presidium should stipulate the maximum caliber of artillery and the tonnage of armored vehicles. The presidium should prepare concrete decisions on issues such as military personnel, defense expenditure, arms trade and manufacturing, naval armaments, and violations of regulations on chemical weapons and aerial bombardment. The presidium should convene a general assembly, which should be no later than January 19, 1933. In addition to this, the resolution reserved for the General Assembly the freedom of action on politically sensitive security issues, as well as issues of equality. The resolution also stipulated that the arms truce agreement should be extended every four months, starting from November 1, 1932. Beneš also said that some of the new results obtained were the first stage of a new international law, which he was very satisfied with. The Disarmament Conference had been meeting for five months, and now a concrete result had been achieved. This showed that humanity's dream of hard work and sincere hope was moving in this direction. After Beneš finished speaking, Henderson thanked him and asked each delegation to speak briefly, saying that there was no need for a general discussion, and that if necessary, the General Assembly would meet on Thursday evening to conclude. US Representative Gibson requested to speak. Soviet Representative Litvinov called out: (Your representative has spoken a lot in the past six months. Today, we should make a decision, and not just talk empty words.) Gibson said that this resolution was the basis for moving forward again, so he represented the United States in supporting this resolution. The General Commission was scheduled to continue the discussion at 3:00 PM tomorrow.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Geneva, 20th. The German chief delegate to the Disarmament Conference, Nadolny, visited French Premier Herriot today and delivered Germany's proposed amendments to the Beneš resolution, demanding recognition of Germany's request for equal treatment in disarmament. The amendments were also distributed to representatives of various countries by the German delegation.</p>
<h3>Saito Cabinet Conflicts with the Privy Council</h3>
<p>Over the Status of Judicial Officials</p>
<p>Pan-Fascist Party Instigating Behind the Scenes</p>
<p>▲ China United Press, Tokyo, 21st. The Saito Cabinet is facing criticism from the Privy Council over the status of judicial officials. Justice Minister Oyama was unable to answer, and Saito answered instead, resulting in emotional conflict between the Saito Cabinet and the Privy Council. It is rumored that Hiranuma and others from the State Society are instigating behind the scenes, intending to overthrow the current cabinet and promote the realization of a fascist cabinet.</p>
<h3>Polish Intellectuals Support the Anti-War Congress</h3>
<p>Declaration Denounces Japanese Ambitions</p>
<p>▲ News Agency, Warsaw, 20th. Many representatives from Polish literary, scientific, and other groups have issued a declaration supporting the International Anti-War Congress convened by the famous French writer Barbusse, which will soon open in Geneva. The declaration stated that only fourteen years have passed since the last World War, and the world is already seeing a new danger of mass slaughter. The shelling in the East has completely erased the rhetoric of pacifists in the League of Nations. The mad competition for armaments by European countries, created by Japanese imperialists, with France's participation, to deal with the so-called Manchuria (independence) state against the Soviet Union, all show that the rulers of the capitalist world are full of hatred and unease caused by the existence of anti-capitalist countries. This situation is a clear signal of an approaching new war, and the main target of the new war is to oppose the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Outgoing Italian Foreign Minister Grandi to be Ambassador to the U.S.</h3>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Rome, 20th. The resignation of Italian Foreign Minister Grandi and the reorganization of the Italian cabinet have long been anticipated by informed sources. It was only because Italy wanted to maintain the consistency of its policy in the League of Nations conference, the Disarmament Conference, and the Lausanne Conference that the implementation was delayed until now. It is rumored that after leaving the Foreign Ministry, Grandi will take office as the ambassador to the United States. When Grandi visited the United States some time ago and met with the US President and Secretary of State to discuss Italian-American issues, he left a very good impression on important figures in the US government, so it is expected that the Americans will welcome Grandi's mission to their country.</p>

<h3>American Veterans Demonstrate Again in Front of the White House</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 20th. Today, another 200 veterans' representatives demonstrated in front of the White House, but the police ordered them to disperse, and they quietly left. Only a few lingered and were arrested by the police. The leader of the California team, Robertson, said that unless there is a timely method of providing food for the veterans, he will send them to the thoroughfares as living advertisements of poverty, and will also make them stand outside large hotels, so that the general rich can understand the true plight of more than 500 hungry people.</p>
<h3>The Late French Foreign Minister Briand Was Honest Throughout His Life</h3>
<p>Estate Worth Only Three Thousand Four Hundred Yuan</p>
<p>Paris News. The late French Foreign Minister Briand was a great statesman of his time, who worked hard for peace and devoted himself to his duties. He was respected by the world. According to the latest investigation, his entire estate consisted of only 200 yuan found in his home and 3,200 yuan in bank deposits. In addition, he had a garden in Cauchelaire, which was his real estate. This garden was purchased in recent years after he received the Nobel Peace Prize. According to his will, this estate will be distributed to his sister and nephew. (World News Agency)</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Rural Relief Measures under the Japanese Saito Cabinet</h3>
<p>Tokyo Communication</p>
<p>When the Inukai Cabinet collapsed and the Saito military cabinet took its place, the soldiers, who came from the fields, naturally wanted to protect the interests of the elders in the countryside, rather than the industrial and commercial centralism that the political party cabinets of the past had grasped. Therefore, at the beginning of his cabinet formation, Saito's first domestic slogan was (rural relief measures). Returning skin for skin, bone for bone, was a very natural result.</p>
<p>Shortly after Saito formed his cabinet, the 62nd Extraordinary Session of Parliament opened. This session of Parliament left behind many resolutions on rural relief. The government then held several joint meetings of five ministries to discuss the content of the parliamentary resolutions. At the same time, various ministries formulated various concrete plans to prepare for implementation. However, whether these concrete plans can have a (resurrection) effect on the dying Japanese countryside, we dare not make a rash judgment at present. However, at a time when the world economy is full of holes and wounds, it seems questionable whether the Japanese countryside can regain its prosperity through relief measures. The following is a straightforward introduction to some of the concrete plans for Japanese rural relief measures.</p>
<p>I. Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry</p>
<p>(A) Postponement of low-interest repayment. From the 43rd year of the Meiji era to May of the 7th year of the Showa era, the total amount of ordinary funds decided by the Ministry of Finance's Deposit Bureau was 343,735,350 yuan. From the 12th year of the Taisho era to May of the 7th year of the Showa era, the total amount of special funds decided by the Ministry of Finance's Deposit Bureau was 567,638,500 yuan. The total amount of the two funds was 910 million yuan, but the actual amount lent was only about 700 million yuan. 300 million yuan has been repaid over the years. At present, about 400 million yuan remains, of which 80 million yuan is due for repayment at the end of September this year. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry plans to postpone the repayment of this year's amount for three or five years, and then repay it annually.</p>
<p>(B) 500 million yuan of financing. Providing 500 million yuan of low-interest funds for various reclamation, arable land consolidation, water drainage main line projects, fishing port construction, breakwater and forest road development projects. This low-interest fund is long-term, and the government also gives a considerable amount of interest.</p>
<p>(C) Grain control. Recently, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry established a new Rice Department, which began to investigate and study grain (investigation fee of 100,000 yuan, which has been included in this year's supplementary budget and passed by Parliament) in order to regulate the supply and demand of domestic rice, Taiwan rice, and foreign rice, and manage and control it by the state.</p>
<p>(D) Cocoon control. The government will buy the current stock of silk and control future production at the same time. Control silkworm eggs, regulate production, and further reduce the area of mulberry fields. The current barren mulberry fields will be replanted with wheat. For cocoon production, dry cocoon warehouses will be used to maintain prices, and silk companies in various places will be thoroughly reorganized to control their sales. (E) Fertilizer control. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry originally planned to implement a fertilizer supervision system to eliminate the malpractice of unfair fertilizer distribution, but it was suspended due to budget constraints. In the future, it plans to include fertilizer control in the Rice Department.</p>
<p>(F) National large-scale reclamation. According to the investigation by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, there are about 400,000 cho of uncultivated land in Japan today, with more than 500 cho per group. They are divided into 11 regions and are operated by the state.</p>
<h3>II. Ministry of Interior Affairs</h3>
<p>(A) Civil engineering project plan. The Ministry of Interior Affairs is preparing to continue civil engineering projects of 350 million yuan in three years. (1) Road improvement, 1,500 ri 550 million yuan. (2) Small river improvement, 260 rivers, 120 million yuan. (3) Local ports, 200 ports, 80 million yuan. The first year's project cost is 130 million yuan.</p>
<p>Village and town projects, 58 million yuan, evenly distributed to 12,000 villages and towns across the country. Three-quarters (43 million yuan) of this village and town project cost is borne by the national treasury, and the remaining 14 million yuan is borne by the villages and towns, but it can be financed with extremely long-term, interest-free funds. The labor cost of village and town projects accounts for 50% of the total project cost.</p>
<p>National direct and prefectural projects, 72 million yuan, and the labor cost accounts for 40% of the total project cost.</p>
<p>(B) Other plans. (1) The government should, within the scope of possibility, provide low-interest financing of 74.5 million yuan to local rural areas in the 6th fiscal year, and 27 million yuan in the 7th fiscal year, so that impoverished rural areas can have financial assistance. (2) For the repayment of low-interest, a period should be stipulated, during which the payment should be temporarily suspended. (3) Activate disaster relief funds to flow into rural areas. (4) The national treasury should bear the prefectural and county burdens of the middle and primary school teachers' gratuities. (5) Reduce local taxes to ease the burden on farmers, and at the same time, the tax system should be reformed to allow payment in kind. (6) Expedite the transfer of a portion of mineral production taxes to local areas. (7) Villages and towns with miscellaneous properties should be paid (grants) by the state when they encounter revenue difficulties.</p>
<h3>III. Ministry of Finance (Finance Department)</h3>
<p>The total debt repayment amount of various loan funds of the Ministry of Finance's Deposit Department this year is 88 million yuan, of which agricultural-related loan funds are 40 million yuan. According to the current situation, it is no longer possible to recognize the postponement of repayment. The resulting shortage of funds due to the postponement will be made up by allocating a portion of the 200 million yuan of public bonds raised by the Deposit Department to the Bank of Japan to fill the gap.</p>
<h3>IV. Ministry of Railways</h3>
<p>In order to promote the local rural areas, the Ministry of Railways is preparing to complete the construction of railways earlier. According to the plan of Railway Minister Mitsuchi, he intends to issue 10 million yuan of public bonds every year to complete the Japanese national railway network in the 7th, 8th, and 9th years of Showa. The concrete plans for the Japanese rural relief measures are roughly like this. As for the results, we can only know the facts one or two years later.</p>
<h3>The Painful Situation of the People in the Northeast</h3>
<p>Reading Newspapers from Within the Pass Leads to Arrest</p>
<p>Qingdao Communication. Someone who has just returned to Qingdao from Heilongjiang Province talked about the latest situation in the Northeast, saying that the people in the Northeast are extremely saddened and indignant because of the unreasonable oppression by the Japanese. Therefore, wherever the righteous army goes, they are greeted with food and drink. The people of the Eastern Provinces have been threatened by bandits for years, and all middle-class and above families have guns and ammunition for self-defense. Now they are using the means of defending against bandits to defend against the Japanese. In the past, during March and April, the ice in various places had not yet melted, and the wilderness was boundless, with no place to hide. Therefore, the volunteers did not dare to launch a large-scale offensive. Now that the green gauze curtain has risen, those with guns among the people have taken the opportunity to organize volunteer armies and resist the Japanese. Therefore, volunteer armies are everywhere in various places. Although the volunteer armies have guns, they are extremely short of ammunition. Therefore, every battle is fought with flesh and blood against the enemy's artillery fire, and many die under the rain of bullets. The only hope of the volunteer armies at present is to hope that the government will carry out the actual recovery of the Northeast. The volunteer armies are determined to be the vanguard for this. However, there is also a part of the people who point out that the government has no determination to recover the Northeast, and resentment arises from disappointment. As for news, newspapers in various places have been closed by the Japanese. The news published by those that have not been closed is all one-sided propaganda by the Japanese. Even the news broadcast by the central radio station is interfered with by the Japanese in order to make it impossible to receive. The inspection of newspapers from various places within the Pass sent to the Eastern Provinces is particularly strict. Civilians occasionally obtain one or two copies, which they cherish as treasures. Some even rent the newspaper to others to read, charging five jiao of ocean for every hour read, and the readers still compete for it without complaining about the high price. However, if the Japanese find out, they will arrest the reader and put him in jail. The compatriots in the Northeast are not even allowed to enjoy the freedom of reading newspapers. Schools above the middle level have all been closed, and troops are stationed in the schools, turning them into barracks. The books stored in the schools have all been burned by the Japanese. Although the elementary schools are still open, all the courses must be stipulated by the Japanese in order to implement their education of national subjugation. Transportation is even more controlled by the Japanese. All the ships and trains in various places have been detained by the Japanese for the purpose of transporting troops. Also, several days before the investigation team arrived in Changchun, the Japanese suddenly replaced all the messengers of important organs, as well as the staff and tea servers in the hotels prepared for the investigation team, with Japanese people. After the investigation, it was learned that the Japanese were afraid that the Chinese would reveal the truth about the Northeast to the investigation team, so they took precautions. (July 18)</p>
<h3>The League of Nations Investigation Team Passes Through Qingdao and Jinan on Their Way North</h3>
<p>Representative Gu Prepares to Accompany Them</p>
<p>Jinan Communication. The League of Nations investigation team, led by Lytton, having exchanged views with Japanese Foreign Minister Uchida in Japan, left Japan on the Chichibu Maru on the 15th of this month. They arrived in Qingdao at noon on the 19th. That night, they boarded the train with Representative Gu and others who had come to Qingdao to welcome them at 6:33 PM and left Qingdao westward. On the morning of the 20th, they passed through Jinan and went to Zhangzhuang to take a plane to Ping. The following is a record of the situation.</p>
<p>Situation upon arrival in Qingdao. The League of Nations investigation team, led by Chairman Lytton, arrived in Qingdao from Japan at noon on the 19th. Those who welcomed them in our country included Representative Gu, Qingdao Mayor Shen Honglie, Jiaoji Railway Chairman Ge Guangting, and more than 100 heads of various agencies. Because the Chichibu Maru was very large and could not dock, the welcoming personnel boarded the Jupiter small steamer specially prepared by the Port Administration Bureau to meet them away from the dock. When the committee members of the investigation team were invited to transfer to the Jupiter steamer to disembark, Lytton's illness was quite severe, and he could not walk. He was supported by several people to board the small steamer. When he arrived on shore, he was still supported by several people onto a car and went straight to the mayor's official residence to rest. Because of his illness, Lytton did not meet with the reporters. Most of the other members of the committee were also unwilling to express their opinions. Shen Honglie and Ge Guangting set up a banquet for the committee members of the investigation team and Secretary-General Haas at the mayor's official residence. Lytton rested in bed and could not participate. It was happily dismissed at 3:00 PM. At 3:30 PM, Representative Gu met with the reporters of the Heping Daily at the mayor's official residence and made a speech, which was similar to the one he made in Tianjin and Jinan. Next, the Secretary-General of the investigation team, Haas, spoke to the reporters, saying that the investigation team had met with Japanese Foreign Minister Uchida and others in Japan to exchange opinions. It was originally agreed that the results would not be published in newspapers, but the local Japanese newspapers had many records, and their content was mostly inconsistent with the facts and mostly had propaganda effect. The investigation team absolutely did not recognize them. In short, no matter what Japan's attitude is, the investigation team's position will never change, and it will still report to the League of Nations with the same impartial attitude as before and with facts. At 6:00 PM, the investigation team went by car from the mayor's official residence to the station. They boarded the special train of Beining Road at 6:33 PM and left Qingdao westward. However, because Lytton was seriously ill, he used an ambulance to send him from the mayor's official residence to the station. He was still supported by several people onto the train. Representative Gu went west in the same train with Lytton and others. Shen Honglie, Ge Guangting, and more than 100 officials from various agencies went to the station to see them off.</p>
<p>Situation upon passing through Jinan. The investigation team's special train left Qingdao on the evening of the 19th. It was originally scheduled to arrive in Jinan at 5:35 AM on the 20th, but the Jiaoji railway locomotive was too slow and did not arrive until 7:23 AM. Provincial government representative Construction Director Zhang Honglie and Jinan Mayor Wen Chenglie welcomed and received them at the station. Public Security Bureau Director Wang Kaiyu also went to the station to direct the security team to protect them. British Consul Yang Zhuozhi and Japanese Consul Nishida also went to the station to welcome them. After the train stopped, Zhang and Wen boarded the train to see Gu Weijun first. Gu immediately discussed the itinerary with the investigation team. It was decided that Lytton, the French representative, and Gu Weijun would take a plane to Ping, and assistant Zheng Liqing would accompany them. The remaining members of the committee and Secretary-General Haas would continue to take the train north. Zhang Xueliang sent a plane to pick up Lytton, which arrived in Jinan at 6:30 PM on the 19th. It included two technicians, as well as Zhang's advisors Earlo and Tanner, League of Nations Secretary Filder, and Zhang's attending physician Zuo Ji. The plane was a new Ford. When the investigation team's special train arrived at the station, the old Ford plane also rushed from Ping. Then Lytton was helped out of the car by people, onto a stretcher, with a sick face, but still in good spirits. Zhang Honglie, on behalf of Provincial Chairman Han Fuju, expressed his condolences. Lytton expressed his gratitude. Then he was carried out of the station onto a car, and went with Gu Weijun, the French representative, and Zheng Liqing to Zhangzhuang Airport. It was planned that Gu and Lytton would take the new Ford plane, and the French representative and Zheng Liqing would take the old Ford plane. As for the investigation team's special train, it passed the track at 8:05 AM and went to Tianjin-Pukou Station. The reporter interviewed the Secretary-General of the group, Haas, on the train, asking what he thought of the investigation team's strong attitude towards Japan this time. Haas replied that this time he went to Japan and met with the key government officials. It was not convenient to publish the matters discussed at the moment. The scenery in Japan was very good and the place was peaceful. There was nothing else to think about. As for the Japanese newspapers reporting that their attitude was very strong, it may be the claim of a part of their people, and what their government expressed was not so strong. The reporter asked what he thought of Japan's recognition of the puppet state of Manchuria. (Answer) Nothing much, this level has not been studied very much. (Question) Has the report been started? (Answer) It had been started before going to Japan, and it is in progress. However, most of it must be compiled in Peiping to get results. (Question) How is Lytton's health? (Answer) He has been ill in Japan, and he has suffered from the wind and waves on the boat, but in the past two days, he has felt much better. Although he needs a long period of recuperation, he has decided to instruct his work as soon as possible after arriving in Ping because the preparation of the report is of great importance in order to expedite the success. Haas also said that because of Lytton's illness, he only wired Director Zhang in Beiping yesterday morning to ask him to send a plane to pick him up. The time was very short, but they were able to make it in time. He was very grateful for Director Zhang's enthusiasm. At 8:45 AM, the train went north, with the Japanese representative Yoshida traveling with them. (20th)</p>
<h3>Yuebei Bandits Retreat from Xinfeng</h3>
<p>Bandit Army Suffers Heavy Losses, Over Several Thousand Killed or Wounded</p>
<p>Central Army under Chen Cheng Arrives at Dayu</p>
<p>Xiang Hanping Heads to Beijiang to Assume Post of Commander-in-Chief</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Since the bandit troops from Jiangxi attacked Xiong Yu, fierce battles with the Guangdong army have raged near Nanxiong for three days and nights. Guangdong rapidly reinforced its troops and dispatched over twenty aircraft to provide continuous support. Eventually, the communist bandits were repelled and suffered heavy losses. It has been found that the most effective unit of the Guangdong army in the Nanxiong area was the Independent Second Brigade under Chen Zhang. On the 11th and 12th, Lin Biao's bandit troops attacked Meiling, behind Dayu, engaging in fierce fighting for a day and night with the First Regiment of Chen Zhang's brigade, led by Du Fengfei, and the regiments led by Peng Linsheng of the First Division and Zhao Lian of the Training Corps. Simultaneously, the Fourth Division of the Second Army, under Zhang Meixin, returning from Xinfeng, encountered bandit ambushes along the way. At Daxiaowo Jiudushui, they were cut off by the bandits and fought for a day and night before reaching Datang, thirty li from Xiongjing. At Datang, they were again confronted by five or six thousand bandits, engaging in a standoff for a day and night. By the morning of the 13th, Lai Jinhui's bandit troops intensified their siege of Datang. The Eleventh Regiment of Zhang's division, under Wu Jianxiong, was trapped, but the Twelfth Regiment, under Luo Jinying, came to their rescue and repelled the bandits. Lai's bandit forces retreated in disarray towards Zhoujinbao. According to air force reports, the number of bandits attacking Nanxiong this time was no less than seventy or eighty thousand, who moved by night and hid by day. After capturing Xinfeng, they cut off all roads to Nanxiong and Dayu, surrounding them in layers, displaying extreme ferocity. Fortunately, the air force detected their main force on the Nanxiong road and deployed twenty regiments of troops and over twenty aircraft to bomb the bandits. The bandits also fought desperately, resulting in a stalemate lasting three days and nights, with over several thousand casualties. Finally, on the afternoon of the 13th, realizing they could not succeed, the bandits began to flee northeast back towards Xinfeng. After the retreat, the Fifth Division of the Second Army, under Zhang Da, stationed in Xiongcheng, and the Second Regiment of the Training Division, under Liang Gongfu, conducted search-and-pursuit operations on the morning of the 14th, supported by several aircraft. The Guangdong army pursued them to the vicinity of Shuikouxu, where they suddenly encountered an ambush by the remaining bandits. The fighting lasted for several hours. By this time, the main force of the bandits, numbering fifty or sixty thousand, had already retreated back to Xinfeng. The bandits at Shuikou were merely a rearguard to cover the retreat of the main force. Therefore, the battle lasted only a short time before the bandits continued to retreat to Dayu and Xintian, about sixty li from Nanxiong. By the 15th, Zhang Da's division and Liang's regiment had advanced and occupied Shuikouxu. However, although the bandits had retreated, their movements remained unpredictable. The Guangdong army is currently proceeding cautiously, awaiting intelligence on the actual situation of the bandits before launching a deep pursuit. Therefore, after the 15th, the border warfare has temporarily subsided. As for the Fourth Division of the Second Army, which broke through from Xinfeng, they were ambushed along the way and fought without food for three days and nights. By the time they reached Nanxiong, they were surrounded by fierce bandits, leaving the entire division exhausted. The division commander, Zhang Meixin, returned to the province from the front lines on the 14th to recover from his injuries. He arrived in Guangzhou at 6:00 PM and immediately met with Chen Jitang to report on the course of the battle, before entering the Ersha Island Sanatorium to recuperate from his injuries. It is also reported that the regimental commanders under Zhang's command, Wu Jianxiong, Kong Kequan, and Jiang Wu, sustained minor injuries while repeatedly breaking through the encirclement. The Fourteenth Division, under Zhou Zhirou, and the Fifty-second Division, under Li Ming, of the Central Army under Chen Cheng in Jiangxi Province, have moved south from Wan'an and Suichuan to jointly encircle the bandits with the Guangdong army. According to yesterday's telegrams, the two divisions of the Central Army have arrived near Dayu and are consulting with the Guangdong army on coordination. The Guangdong army is currently transferring troops north from the province in preparation for pursuing and suppressing the Jiangxi bandits. Recently, two regiments of the newly formed supplementary brigade of the Nineteenth Route Army in Guangdong have also been ordered to move north to support the rear.

<h3>Yellow River Water Levels Surge</h3>
<p>▲But Spring Repairs Were Extremely Solid, So There Is No Need to Worry</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: The Yellow River in this province has seen surging water levels for days. Existing dangers have been reported as urgent due to the rains, and new dangers are emerging one after another. The ninth and tenth sections of the dyke at Li Shengcun in the upper reaches have collapsed severely. In the lower reaches, a new danger has emerged at Bianzhuang, where the collapse has reached the base of the dyke. Over seventy committee members responsible for defense and sub-defense have all arrived at the construction sites today (20th) to supervise. Large quantities of sacks, ropes, stakes, etc., are being rushed to</p>
<p>transport up and down the river to dangerous areas via red boats and civilian boats. The water channel at Zhukou in the upper reaches is also gradually approaching the base of the dyke. Zhang Lianjia, director of the River Affairs Bureau, went to Luokou yesterday (19th) to inspect and only returned at 8:00 PM. The water level at Luokou reached 29.34 meters, only one decimeter less than the highest water level last year. Zhang plans to go to the upper reaches again within the next few days for inspection. It is reported that the water level is only one meter away. Zhang plans to go to the upper reaches again within the next few days for inspection. It is reported that the cause of the water surge is due to the melting of the Kangzang snow mountains and heavy rains in Shanxi. Fortunately, this</p>
<p>year's spring repairs were extremely solid. Even if the water is as high as last year, there is absolutely no danger. (20th)</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province Business Tax Meeting</h3>
<p>▲Decision to Rectify Tax Collection Methods</p>
<p>Hangzhou Dispatch: After officials and merchants discussed and decided on a method for increasing the business tax rate in Zhejiang Province, the annual revenue can be increased to 2.2 million yuan. In order to prevent the concealment and reduction of tax revenue, the Finance Department specially convened a meeting of business tax bureau directors from the nine districts of the province yesterday (20th) and decided on the following measures: (1) Regarding the issue of wholesale and retail sales, if goods are directly sold to consumers or transported in bulk to other provinces for sale, those who receive these goods are not small businesses within the province liable for retail business tax and cannot be treated as wholesale sales. Retail tax must be levied uniformly, without any leniency that could hinder tax revenue. Shops engaged in wholesale business should be clearly separated and separate accounts should be established. (2) Regarding tax exemptions, the original regulations state that businesses with an operating income of less than 1,000 yuan and a capital of less than 500 yuan are exempt from tax. Merchants must not underreport their income to arbitrarily evade taxes. All collection agencies should pay special attention and not allow any concealment. (3) Businesses that have been missed or have not been taxed should be re-examined separately and ordered to pay the arrears. (4) All industries that have already been assessed for tax payment should be thoroughly investigated and verified if they have not fully reported their income. (5) Regarding penalties, concealment, loopholes, and tricks should be eliminated, and penalties should be strictly enforced, with 50% of the fine awarded to the informant and 25% retained by the bureau as a reward. This should be widely publicized. (6) For delinquent businesses, the regulations must be enforced without any hesitation that may affect revenue collection. (July 21st)</p>
<h3>Zeng Guangxiang Reorganizes the Politics and Infrastructure of the Ping-Sui Railway</h3>
<p>▲Replacing Railroad Ties and Repairing Vehicles</p>
<p>▲Strict Reward and Punishment for Staff and Employees</p>
<p>Beiping Dispatch: The Ping-Sui Railway Administration has been repeatedly affected by wars over the past few years, leading to a sharp decline in revenue and a severe shortage of funds. Despite the importance of the railway to Northwest transportation, it has been unable to carry out many needed reorganization tasks due to financial constraints. Since taking office, Director Zeng Guangxiang has recruited talent and actively reorganized the administration. Recently, in light of the poor business performance and in order to maintain revenue and reorganize the infrastructure, he has made every effort to replace the rotten railroad ties and has also supervised and urged employees to fully repair the damaged vehicles and locomotives. He has also recovered rolling stock that had been seized by various military forces, eliminating any shortage of vehicles. He has also strived for thoroughness and perfection in terms of hygiene and safety equipment on the trains, and passengers have praised the convenience. As a result, business has improved dramatically and revenue has increased several times over. Zeng has strongly advocated for transparency in financial matters and has been strict and fair in rewarding and punishing staff and employees. He has used the monthly surplus of the Railway Administration to progressively make up for back wages, and employees have been able to live comfortably and securely, serving with loyalty. The administration's infrastructure has been improving day by day. In order to understand the lives of workers and improve their conditions, Zeng personally visits and inspects outside stations during his spare time. Recognizing the hard work of the workers, he offers them encouragement. He also places great importance on the education of workers' children and has established numerous "Binglun" primary schools in various sections to enroll the children of railway workers as much as possible, aiming to promote universal education. As a result, the employees of the entire railway are extremely grateful. Recently, they jointly launched a project to create a plaque bearing the inscription "Eternal Gratitude for Kindness" and several silver tripods, banners, and umbrellas, and sent dozens of representatives with a band to the residence of Zeng in Dongtangzi Hutong, Dongcheng, to hang the plaque in his home to commemorate him.</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>▲Opening of the Epidemic Hospital Since the beginning of summer in this port,</p>
<p>due to the heat and humidity, epidemics have been spreading, and many people are being infected. If not treated early, death can occur within hours. According to doctors, the current epidemic of cholera is even more virulent. Even after being treated with saline solution, some cases suddenly turn into symptoms resembling typhoid fever, making them impossible to save. The sheer number of deaths has overwhelmed the local undertakers, and coffin shops are also reporting shortages. Therefore, at the last county government meeting, it was decided to organize an epidemic hospital. Through the efforts of the preparatory committee, the Xiaobei Temple site was selected, and Zhang Shaoxiu and Zhang Zhongji were appointed as chief physicians. After ten days of preparation, the hospital was officially established today (21st), with complete and well-arranged facilities. The opening ceremony was held at 10:00 AM, with county magistrate's clerk Li Yangxian representing the county magistrate and presiding over the meeting. Among the guest speakers were Shen Benqian, director of the People's Education Center, Shen Jing, director of the Public Security Bureau, and Tong Xuewen, president of the Red Branch Society. After the ceremony, photographs were taken and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>▲Money Theft Case Cracked, Stolen Goods Recovered The Qian family of Aijiaqiao in the north gate returned from Shanghai last month where they had sought refuge. That night, they were victims of a major theft, losing cash, jewelry, valuable leather clothing, and other items worth a considerable amount. After repeated investigations by the Public Security Bureau, no leads were found. The day before yesterday, the Inspectorate received a report that Zhang Guiting, who lived in Tianchuang Lane, was highly suspected. The director of the Inspectorate, Zhang Zhiying, and inspector Yang Shijie went to investigate secretly and found over seventy pieces of the Qian family's stolen goods, including pawn tickets, at Zhang's residence. Zhang Guiting, his wife Zhang Fan, and He Sun were arrested and taken to the county Public Security Bureau for preliminary investigation along with the stolen goods. They claimed that his wife had found the items in the Maqi Temple area and denied the theft. The county Public Security Bureau has prepared a document to transfer Zhang Guiting and the stolen goods to the county court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>▲Prisoners Riot Due to Extreme Heat Recently, the weather has been extremely hot and epidemics have been rampant. In the past week, twenty to thirty people have died from epidemics in the urban and rural areas of Suzhou every day. The most severe cases result in death within half an hour. The epidemic hospitals are also overcrowded. The inmates at the Wuxian County Local Court Detention Center rioted yesterday due to the extreme heat. Director Yao led the medical staff into the detention center to suppress the riot, which was eventually quelled.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>▲Provincial Order to Dissolve the Disaster Relief Association The four rural areas of this county have suffered frequent natural and man-made disasters, resulting in extremely severe famine. Mournful cries can be heard throughout the countryside, and the rural economy has completely collapsed. Various groups and organizations in the county, recognizing this situation, organized a temporary disaster relief association. In the month since its establishment, they have been working tirelessly to raise funds. However, their application to the provincial authorities to retain special funds for local construction for use in disaster relief has not been approved. Therefore, Cai Tiping, Chen Zhanru, Gu Binsheng, and Gao Jiansi (represented by Xue Mingjian) were sent as representatives to the provincial capital on the 19th, carrying important petition materials, to petition the authorities. When they arrived at the provincial capital, County Magistrate Chen had already been summoned to be there. Cai and the others went to the provincial government and various departments to petition on the morning of the 20th, and were received by Chairman Gu, who promised to respond at 7:00 PM that evening. The representatives returned to the provincial government at 7:00 PM that evening and were again received by Chairman Gu. After some discussion, Gu said that the handling of the disaster relief association had been handed over to County Magistrate Chen and that they could contact County Magistrate Chen directly. The representatives then went to see County Magistrate Chen, who presented them with a directive from the provincial government instructing the county magistrate to clearly inform the disaster relief association that it must be dissolved within three days</p>
<p>and that if it did not comply, it would be subject to appropriate sanctions.</p>
<p>After reading the directive, the representatives looked at each other in dismay. Realizing that the attitude of the provincial government was such, there was no point in staying in the capital, so they returned to Wuxi separately that evening.</p>
<p>▲Petition to Recover Back Pay for Teachers The primary school teachers of this county have asked the education authorities to use cash to pay the four-tenths of the owed wages, because the vouchers issued are rejected. This matter was resolved at the third meeting of representatives of the county Education Association to seriously negotiate with the Education Bureau. Yesterday, all the representatives went to the Education Bureau to make demands. Director Chen Renshou came out to meet them and said that it had been decided and could not be changed. He then personally took all the representatives to the county government to request a solution. Because County Magistrate Chen had returned to his hometown, Secretary Liao met with them. The Education Association representatives testified that the vouchers issued could only be used to offset the 1931 land tax, but the deadline for paying the 1931 land price tax had long passed, and primary school teachers did not owe land tax, so it was impossible to offset the tax with these vouchers. Secretary Liao also had no solution and returned to the association to discuss four measures: (1) Send a letter to the county government describing the difficulties of the primary schools and requesting that the four-tenths of the owed wages be paid in cash instead of vouchers, because the vouchers are like waste paper and should be urgently collected and the cash collected for repayment. (2) Publish a notice in the newspaper in the name of the conference, informing all school principals and teachers in the county to reject the vouchers. (3) Telegraph the director of the Bureau to come to Wuxi immediately to take office and raise funds to repay the four-tenths of the outstanding expenses. (4) If the authorities do not have a satisfactory solution for the four-tenths of the outstanding education expenses, convene a general meeting of all members in each district to decide on the final solution. It is not known whether the education administration authorities can find a solution.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>▲Provincial Order Approves Reopening The Jiangyin Kebao was sealed by the county Party headquarters on June 28th after it sent a letter to the county magistrate and Public Security Bureau. The newspaper's manager, Zhao Jieshou, repeatedly appealed to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Provincial Government, the Central Party Headquarters, and the Provincial Party Headquarters, arguing that Wang Xianzhai and others falsely accused Liang Yi of harming the life of good doctor Jiang Benli, which was reported by the Jiangyin Evening News. How could it be transplanted? In the case of Qing Yang and Ren Yulin accusing Minnu Wang Yaliang, the plaintiffs mostly conceal their names. The Provincial Party Headquarters, in addition to ordering the County Executive Committee to immediately correct this, also sent a letter to the Provincial Government ordering the Jiangyin County Government to approve the reopening of Kebao. The newspaper is preparing to resume publication.</p>
<h3>Fanyang</h3>
<p>▲Robberies and Injuries in the Northeast Countryside More than ten robbers suddenly came to the home of farmer Xue Xiaofu in Jiegou Village, Dongxiang, broke down the door, and looted everything, causing a loss of about several hundred yuan. Also, on the night before, thirty to forty robbers suddenly came to the home of farmer Wang Dezhai in Qian Sizhuang Village, Beixiang, speaking in the local dialect and each carrying sharp weapons. They stormed through the door, ransacked the house, and stabbed Wang's wife with a knife. Neighbors secretly reported the incident to the Eighth Branch of the Public Security Bureau and the police team stationed nearby, who divided into teams to hunt down the robbers. They captured three robbers, Huang Heshang, Huang Qing, and Wu Desheng, on the way, and they have been sent to the county for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>▲Fourth Prison Handles Amnesty The Nantong Fourth Prison has been ordered to handle the amnesty. There are currently over 380 male and female prisoners in the entire prison. Warden Sun Xiong is currently reviewing the cases, and it is estimated that over fifty people meet the requirements for amnesty. A list has been prepared and submitted to the Ministry of Justice for review. Once approval is received, they will be released or have their sentences reduced accordingly.</p>
<p>▲Labor-Management Summer Work Meeting Recently, the weather has been hot, and workers and factory owners in Tong County have been negotiating vacation issues. In order to avoid disputes, the county government specially convened representatives from both labor and management on the 20th to resolve summer work issues. It was decided that both day and night shifts would be reduced by three hours. If the temperature reaches 95 degrees, work will be suspended for half a day, and wages will be paid at 75%. Coastal Salt Tax Increase The deputy salt transport commissioner of Lianghuai, Hu Xingchi, telegraphed the county magistrates of Nantong Rugao and Hai'an, stating that from the 20th, the salt tax in Nantong will be increased by 50 cents per dan and 5 li per jin. Rugao's tax will be increased by 25 cents per dan and 2.5 li per jin. The coastal tax will be increased by 75 cents per dan and 7.5 hao per jin. In the special addition district, Changsha, the tax will be increased by 1.4 yuan per dan and 1.4 li per jin.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>County Magistrate Yang Argues in Court Jiangdu County Magistrate Yang Zhuomao previously received a secret report that Wang Ganju, manager of the Shaobo Dalian Transportation Company, was suspected of collaborating with the enemy. He immediately secretly ordered police platoon leader Yang Juansheng to arrest him. Although there was no external evidence, a set of smoking paraphernalia was found. Wang was escorted to the city, intending to transfer him to the court. At that time, due to the lack of funds for repairing the embankment in 感洲, a fine of 600 yuan was imposed. Wang was dissatisfied with the fine and filed a complaint with the High Court, which designated the Jiangdu Local Branch Court to handle the case. Yang did not attend the first investigative hearing held by the procuratorate. At the second investigative hearing yesterday, the plaintiff and defendant were present on time and were questioned separately for two hours. As a result, the prosecutor stated that County Magistrate Yang's restriction on Wang's residence was based on Article 80 of the Criminal Procedure Law, and that the plaintiff Wang Ganju was indeed suspected of smoking opium, and ordered him to provide a deposit of 100 yuan, with both personal and surety bonds.</p>
<p>Arrested for Forging Official Documents and Attempting Fraud Wang Chao Gui, who lived in Xinqiao West in the city, colluded with Bao Liren, Lan Weizhi, and others to forge official documents from the military and police inspection office, intending to extort money from a certain second young lady in a nearby nunnery on a smoking case. The matter was discovered by the investigation team of the county police team, who arrested Wang Bao and Lan one after another last night (20th) and seized the forged official documents and seals. All were taken to the county for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Conflict Between Town and Garrison Police in Tanghui Town Wang Xuede, a garrison policeman in the Tanghui Town District Garrison Basic Team, hired a vehicle to go to the city for medical treatment yesterday afternoon due to acute dysentery. The District Garrison Chief Wang telegraphed the town's Public Security Bureau to request accommodation, but Director Lin of the Public Security Bureau refused to accommodate him. The gardener argued with the Public Security Bureau that the illness was critical and that there was no time to delay. Director Lin ordered the police to fire a warning shot. The District Garrison Chief arrived after hearing the news and ordered the gardener to go back to avoid escalating the situation. At that time, the residents of the town suddenly heard gunshots and suspected that there was a bandit alarm, causing great panic. The town's voluntary security group, organized by the business community, also suspected a bandit alarm and all armed themselves for defense and questioned the Public Security Bureau about the origin of the gunshots. The response was that it was an accidental fire. The masses were greatly angered by this. Although local figures mediated a settlement, it has not yet been resolved.</p>
<p>Two Children Tragically Killed by Explosion Pan Fumen, a farmer from Xianju County, living in Dingxiaobang, Tangkou, Pinghu near the eastern city wall of Jiaxing, had three children: an eldest daughter, 16 years old; a son, 15 years old named Guan Sheng; and a younger daughter, 9 years old named Ruihua. On the afternoon of the 20th, Ruihua picked up a hand grenade that had been left behind by the army during its previous passage in the Zhang bushes near the countryside. The children did not know what it was and brought it back to play with. Due to carelessness, it fell to the ground. With a loud explosion, the grenade exploded, and the second daughter and son were tragically killed, with their intestines flowing out and blood and flesh splattered everywhere. The eldest daughter was also nearby and seriously injured. She was rushed to the Evangelical Hospital in the city for treatment. Because the Pan family was extremely poor, the bodies of the two children had not been coffined on the morning of the 21st. The villagers raised money to buy coffins for them.</p>
<h3>Pinghu</h3>
<p>Another Road Robbery in the City Wang, who lived near the South Gate, had previously been robbed of silver by bandits on the road. The case remains unsolved. Yesterday, Gu Zhizheng, the owner of the Zhang Xiaoquan scissors shop, was walking with his wife on Shijie Street when they were suddenly surrounded by several people who stuffed a bag of excrement into their mouths. Taking advantage of the chaos, they snatched thirty yuan in cash and nineteen yuan in silver before fleeing in a crowd. Gu tried his best to catch up and captured one of them, who was handed over to the police. The suspect, named Liu Shunlong, confessed without hesitation and also implicated several accomplices. They have been sent to the county for investigation.</p>
<p>Boat Owner's Embezzlement Case Solved Jin Liu and Jin Ming, brothers who owned a rowboat that traveled between Pinghu and Fengjing, had been delivering goods for merchants in both places. Last month, they suddenly became unscrupulous and embezzled a large sum of money before fleeing without a trace. The victimized stores appointed a representative, Zhu Shousheng, to file a complaint with the county government. The county government immediately consulted the Ship Management Office to find out the shop guarantors of the boat and ordered them to find the original people involved in the case. A few days ago, the suspect Jin Liu was arrested in Xiaoshan and extradited to this county for questioning and detention.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Shop Assistant Commits Suicide After Quarrel Chen Qixiang, the owner of the Hengshengyuan paper shop in Caishiqiao, Hangzhou, was from Zhuji. Shop assistants Cao Peigen and Weng Yiwei were also from the same hometown. On the 19th, Cao and Weng had a quarrel for some reason, and Chen mediated it. Peigen then went out and returned to the shop at noon. After lunch, he rested upstairs. But when dinner time came, he still hadn't come downstairs. Chen went to call him and saw that Peigen's face had changed greatly. He realized that he had taken poison. He was rushed to the hospital for treatment, but it was discovered that he had swallowed opium. A telegram was sent to his hometown to ask his family to come to Hangzhou. He died at twelve o'clock that night. In his luggage, there was a suicide note addressed to his mother, which briefly stated that he had been insulted and decided to die. The Hangzhou Local Court was reported to conduct an examination. His brother, Pei Xin, also arrived and requested that an examination be waived.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Joint Military and Police Suppression of Bandits in Two Counties Xie Pingfan, director of the Yuyao County Public Security Bureau, has been paying close attention to local security since the robbery at Song Yizhang's home in Nancheng, the county seat. He has secretly deployed detectives to investigate the bandits' tracks. Later, it was reported that the area near Kantun in the north countryside was where the bandits were hiding. However, that area is adjacent to Cixi County, and it would be difficult to achieve results without a joint suppression. Therefore, he sent personnel to discuss joint suppression methods with the Cixi County authorities. Yesterday, the director personally led over sixty people, including military police and security groups, and joined forces with the director of the Cixi County Public Security Bureau, Lü Siyi, and advanced towards Kantun in separate directions. As a result, five bandits, Li Yaoquan, Gao Songting, Wang Ah Quan, Hu Shisheng, and Shi Weichuan, were captured alive. The bandit leader Hu Liyuan was injured but managed to escape.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing</h3>
<p>Inmates Escape from Detention Center At 6:00 PM on the 19th, a large number of inmates at the Shaoxing Local Branch Court Detention Center took advantage of the opportunity to be released from their cells and escaped. The inmates broke their shackles and used them as weapons to break through the doors and flee towards Yahu. The director of the detention center, Wang Xingli, was out at the time. A prison guard urgently reported the incident to the Public Security Bureau, which dispatched patrol teams to pursue them in separate directions. Three bandits, Sun A Ming, a kidnapper; Tong A Si, a robber; and Zhao A Lai, were captured. Eight escapees remained: suspects Dong A Ming, Shi A Rong, Xu Shui Lin, Pan Jing Chao, and Wang A You, all suspected of robbery; Wang Ji Lai, guilty of assault; Qian Feng Sheng, guilty of abduction; and Wu Chang Qing, guilty of theft.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Education Department Orders that Each Grade in Primary School Should Have 50 Students</h3>
<p>In the future, the diligence and laziness in running a school and the quality of its performance</p>
<p>Will be measured by the number of students</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education instructs that each primary school grade should have a full quota of fifty students. The popularization of compulsory education is a key policy for promoting political tutelage and rescuing the country from decline. Its significance and importance should be known to everyone. The department's responsibility is to address the fact that less than 20% of school-age children in the province are enrolled in school, and it is constantly concerned about how to provide educational opportunities for out-of-school children. However, funding is the lifeblood of any undertaking, and in a time when education funds in various counties are extremely tight, it is not appropriate to talk expansively about expanding operations. However, since the popularization of compulsory education is an urgent priority, we cannot abandon it altogether due to insufficient funding. We should seek alternative ways to implement popularization in the midst of extreme financial difficulties. According to recent surveys and statistics, there are approximately 13,756 primary school grades in the province, and less than 10% of them meet the department's standard of 50 students per grade. On average, there are less than 40 students per grade. If we were to meet the department's standard, we could accommodate up to 140,000 more children. Although this is still a small number compared to the total number of out-of-school children, it does not require a significant increase in funding and can allow more than 140,000 children to attend school, which is a different method of popularizing compulsory education under the current circumstances. The Ministry of Education has already issued regulations for the implementation of short-term compulsory education, and the department has also promulgated measures to improve private primary schools, regulations for the management of private schools, and simple rules for the improvement and prohibition of private schools. All of these are considerations for the current stage of seeking popularization. Now, in order to further improve, the content of each established grade should be enriched. It is specially ordered that the county magistrates, together with the directors of education bureaus, should comply with this. All established primary school grades should have a full quota of 50 students, unless the classrooms are demonstrably too small and other regulations are in place. Those that do not meet the quota must make every effort to recruit enough students. County supervisors and education committee members should conduct a serious investigation of the actual number of students in each grade in accordance with the regulations. If the quota is not met, they should supervise the principals to make every effort to rectify the situation. If the environment is unfavorable and it is impossible to meet the quota, they should consider relocating or closing the school. In the future, when provincial supervisors go out to inspect, the number of students will be the standard for judging the diligence in running a school and the quality of its performance. When county supervisors and education committee members conduct investigations, they should be impartial and register the actual situation. If any act of favoritism or false reporting is discovered, severe punishment will be imposed without leniency. This measure by the department is to strive for the popularization of compulsory education at a time when funds are not very abundant and operations cannot be expanded. The county magistrates, together with the directors of education bureaus, should understand the department's intention and diligently implement it, and carefully inform the principals and teachers of the primary schools. Principals and teachers of primary schools in various counties should strive to improve their teaching methods in order to gain the trust of the general public, so that the number of enrolled children can meet the quota. You are also instructed to inform them of this. This order is hereby issued.</p>

<p>Newly Established Schools are Only Allowed to Enroll First-Year Students</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau instructs private secondary schools in the city: It has come to the bureau's attention that some private secondary schools in the city, when enrolling students or changing their original organization, have failed to comply with regulations, which has led to problems. The bureau has repeatedly issued circulars to various schools in accordance with the Ministry of Education's regulations on private schools. As the academic year comes to an end and schools are enrolling students, it is feared that laxity may develop over time. Therefore, the previous order is reiterated. It has been found that the Ministry of Education's Instruction No. 205 roughly states, "(In order to reorganize private schools, the Ministry has repeatedly ordered the suspension or closure of schools that have been found to be poorly managed or in violation of laws and regulations. The methods of disposition should be clearly stipulated in order to facilitate compliance. (3) Newly established schools are only allowed to enroll first-year students in order to prevent abuse.)" The above-mentioned enrollment restrictions for newly established schools have been repeatedly announced by the bureau. However, it has recently been found that some newly established schools arbitrarily enroll second and third-year students, which not only violates the Ministry's regulations but also leads to disputes, which is inappropriate. Furthermore, Article 2 of the Regulations on Private Schools states, "(If a private school intends to change or discontinue operations, it must obtain permission from the competent educational administrative authority.)" However, it has recently been found that some secondary schools in the city arbitrarily establish or discontinue operations without prior approval, which makes it difficult to assess. This is also inappropriate. In the future, all private secondary schools in the city, whether newly established schools enrolling new students or existing schools changing their organization, must strictly comply with the regulations and proceed in an orderly manner. If anyone fails to comply with the regulations, the bureau will take action to ban them. Therefore, the previous order is hereby reiterated. All schools under your jurisdiction must comply with this order without fail.</p>

It was initially designated for the Zhuanqiao Farmers' Education Center to issue a receipt and jointly keep it with the social education institutions.

Other facilities are also being actively established. In addition, the attached primary school has been operating for seven years, and the number of students has been increasing year by year. The school has been relocated three times and expanded repeatedly, but it is still felt that the students are crowded and there are often similar corners. Now that the middle school has moved into a new school, the old site has been completely handed over to the primary school. As a result, the school buildings are spacious. Teachers have been hired and grades have been added, and facilities have been increased. Therefore, the spirit and form of the two schools will have a new look in the next session.</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous Feelings in the Hot Summer II One Branch Talk</h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>The lotus flower fears the wind but not the sun. When the wind comes, it always dodges east and flashes west. When it sees the scorching sun, it resists independently.</p>
<p>The lotus leaf facing the sky is like Sima Xiangru, suffering from diabetes, begging God for a cup of golden dew.</p>
<p>With the thermometer above ninety degrees, our artistic thoughts, the meaning of novels, all turn into dripping sweat, flowing non-stop in waves.</p>
<p>Cicada! Cicada! He is the proclaimer under the scorching sun! The higher the temperature, the more urgent his proclamation becomes. But when he gets some cool wind, his proclamation becomes lower!</p>
<p>Cicada! Cicada! It is like the summer school opened by the insect world. Once summer is over, the sound of reading stops abruptly.</p>
<p>Who is it that sits high on the emerald green platform, waiting for the lotus flowers in the pond to bloom? It is the dragonfly pinned to the lotus leaf.</p>
<p>Reddening half the sky, the Soviet government is also being built in the sky, and the officials who come and go are walking with fiery umbrellas.</p>
<p>Buddhists say...if you imagine a great fire within, you will soon feel hot; if you imagine a great water within, you will soon feel cold. The psychological method of escaping the heat is simply to build a mansion of coolness in your mind...no matter how scorching the sun is in the sky, I only think of myself as a cloud rising and a rain falling. Then, there will be an invisible and silent abundance of sweet rain to extinguish the scorching fire in our hearts.</p>
<h3>The Two Major Memorials in the Ying Shi Memorial Hall</h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>The Chen Ying Shi Memorial Hall, initiated by the Lake Society and others, has been completed. The opening ceremony was held the other day. The general situation was reported in the newspapers the next day. However, the two major memorials collected in the hall were not mentioned. Therefore, I will specifically record them as follows:</p>
<p>The Wooden Stool from the Time of Detention: A special room has been opened opposite the Memorial Hall. In the center is a wooden stool that is two feet high, five feet long, and one and a half feet wide. A piece of white paper is pasted on it with the four characters "(Foundation of the Revolution)" written on it. It also includes a note that says: "(When attacking the Shanghai Arsenal, our martyr Chen Ying Shi led patriots as the vanguard of the people. Although he was trapped on this stool for one night, he finally won the victory. Shanghai was able to be restored, and the Manchus were driven out to return our country. It was based on this stool. I respectfully write a few words to commemorate it.)" It is said that after the Wuchang Uprising of 1911, Mr. Ying Shi planned to respond in Nanjing. However, because Tie Liang and Zhang Xun were trapped, there was no way to start. He returned to Shanghai to deploy and proceed. When attacking the Shanghai Arsenal on September 13, a part of the troops stationed in the Arsenal had expressed their support for the revolution, and a part still expressed their opposition, still resisting. Ying Shi was unwilling to see Han people killing each other and was willing to enter the Arsenal empty-handed to enlighten the resisting troops. Unexpectedly, after arriving at the Arsenal, he was detained by the garrison and locked to this stool with iron chains for one night. His comrades outside heard about this and worked hard to attack, breaking through the Arsenal and restoring Shanghai. Therefore, Chen was publicly elected as the Governor of Shanghai, and this stool was taken out and preserved.</p>
<p>The Blood-Stained Clothes from the Time of His Murder: There is a glass cabinet next to the stool. Inside are a snuff tweed jacket and a black satin mandarin jacket. Underneath are three pieces of cotton-padded jackets and short shirts and pants. Upon closer inspection, there are many blood stains on the clothes. It is said that this is the clothing worn by Mr. Ying Shi when he was assassinated at No. 14 Sapo Sai Road in the French Concession of Shanghai on May 18, 1916. At that time, he was against the imperial system. Mr. Ying Shi had failed several times and was facing financial difficulties. He hid in this house. Yuan Shikai offered a large reward to recruit people to assassinate him. Yuan's spies stationed in Shanghai learned about Mr. Ying Shi's recent situation and, through Xu Guolin, Cheng Zian, and others, established the Hongfeng Coal Mine Company and colluded with the Kuomintang traitor Li Haiqiu, saying that the company had a mine and planned to pawn it to the Japanese. If Mr. Ying Shi could introduce it, then 40% of the pawned money could be used for revolutionary expenses. Mr. Ying Shi believed it to be true and agreed to make the introduction. It was agreed to sign the contract at his residence on that day. After Li Haiqiu and others arrived at the residence, they claimed that they had forgotten to bring the original draft of the contract and went out to get it. At this time, the thugs drew their guns and shot Mr. Ying Shi in the head. He was shot several times in the head and died instantly. All the blood that flowed out was on his clothes. After his death, they were treasured to leave a memorial. On that day, Yang Hu, the commander of the Marine Corps who launched the attack from the Zhahe warship, greeted the guests in this room and described the situation at that time in detail. Therefore, the guests all had endless feelings about this wooden stool and the five pieces of blood-stained clothes.</p>
<h3>Impassioned Impulse</h3>
<p>— Qian Taisheng</p>
<p>Recently, looking at the amount of donations received by the Northeast Volunteer Army Relief Association and the indifference of people in Shanghai and other places towards the (Northeast's downfall), we cannot help but feel heartbroken! The Japanese troops in Shanghai are indeed stubbornly refusing to leave, and gazing afar at the valiant warriors in the Northeast rolling in blood every day, one can certainly imagine that they are using large-caliber cannons to bombard, just like when the Japanese troops attacked Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Miaohang, and that they are relentlessly dropping bombs from fighter planes and bombers onto the valiant warriors filled with fervor!</p>
<p>Where the flames of war rise, it is precisely a nation whose heart has not died, making countless bloody surges against modern weapons!</p>
<p>The meaning of this struggle is precisely the resistance of a rising national spirit.</p>
<p>We can look back at the September 18th Incident to see how passionate, how lovely, and how magnificent all of China's expressions were at that time. Hadn't the fervor of the people reached a white-hot state then? How much enthusiasm did Ma Zhanshan's high-pitched call to resist arouse? People who had never shed tears for their country before shed tears! At the same time, almost the entire country was in a state of boiling; telegraphic transfers, postal transfers, and donations almost showed the positive expression of "(China has a solution)". Under this national fervor, shouldn't you not have believed that the temporary impulse would vanish into thin air like a wisp of smoke?</p>
<p>The January 28th Incident occurred, and the sounds of cannons and the creaking of airplanes unfolded before our eyes in a heart-stirring manner. Thus, there was another general mobilization across the country, donations, young ladies and wives making silk wadded vests, female students going to the front lines as nurses, and male students shouldering guns to join the army to fight the enemy. China had hope, of course, because everyone was awakened, and the sound of those cannons could not but wake you up! But once the ceasefire agreement was signed, we saw Japanese troops being loaded back onto ships, one after another, and then our hearts were relieved because Shanghai and the Wusong Forts were still ours.</p>
<p>What about the Northeast? It is still amidst the flames of war, with corpses lying everywhere, and continuing to suffer the ravages of modern weapons!</p>
<p>Truly! We have forgotten our Northeast and the 30 million compatriots there!</p>
<h3>Two Amusing Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Huang Ren</p>
<p>Bernard Shaw's Russian Tour: Recently, Bernard Shaw, the great British playwright, made a trip to Russia. One day, he was walking along the Volga River when he suddenly encountered a beautiful little girl playing with sand. He stopped and started chatting with her. The little girl was delighted to see this white-bearded old gentleman. She dropped the sand and accompanied him on a stroll along the river. Her little hand held his, and they talked about trivial matters as they walked. Old Mr. Shaw's heart blossomed, and he was so happy that he forgot his weariness. Eventually, the little girl bid him farewell, saying that it was getting late and she had to go home. He gladly said, "Goodbye, my dear. If your mother asks where you were, tell her that you were just walking along the Volga River with George Bernard Shaw." The old gentleman thought that his famous name would be known to everyone, even women and children, wherever he went. But the little girl didn't know, and mimicking his expression, she smiled and bowed, saying, "When you get home, if your family asks where you were, tell them that you were just walking along the Volga River with Catherine Fedorovna."</p>
<p>Kings are Lazybones: Recently, a question regarding royal grants was raised in the British Parliament, bringing to mind one of the oldest such grants. This grant was originally bestowed by King Charles II upon the Penderel family. To this day, it is still received by the descendants of the Penderel family, who are scattered in America and Australia. However, the funds are not directly disbursed from the British treasury but are paid by the royal trustees from the collected land rent. The origin of this grant has an interesting story behind it. During the Battle of Worcester, King Charles was utterly defeated. The troops of Cromwell, the leader of the revolution, searched everywhere, determined to capture him. King Charles hid in the Boscobel House, belonging to the Penderel family. Once, soldiers suddenly came to search. The King was sitting idly in the kitchen, watching the cooking, in a very dangerous situation. However, one of the ladies had great resourcefulness. She immediately walked up to the King and slapped him in the face, shoving the baby she was holding into his arms, and angrily scolded, "You lazybones, quickly hold the child, and I will lead them to search!" The soldiers would not have suspected that this lazybones was the King. After searching casually for a while, they apologized and left. King Charles thus escaped danger, and he granted them a royal pension every year, which has been followed ever since, up to the present day.</p>
<h3>Artistic Technique</h3>
<p>— Ni Yide</p>
<p>In newspapers, we often see news about our politicians, soldiers, and great men practicing calligraphy and painting after they retire from politics or fall from grace. However, I suspect that they fundamentally do not understand art. They are merely using this to claim elegance for themselves or even for other purposes. I initially had similar suspicions about Mr. Chen Shuren, but after seeing his recent exhibition, I realized that my initial suspicions about Mr. Chen were completely wrong.</p>
<p>Why is that? It is because I saw from Mr. Chen's paintings that he indeed has a deep cultivation of technique.</p>
<p>Currently, people generally misunderstand the issue of technique in painting to a serious extent. I would like to briefly explain it here. The so-called technique by ordinary people refers to a means of being able to vividly depict the surface of objects or to vividly imitate the works of predecessors. But simply having such technique can only be said to be dead technique, which is completely separated from the spirit of the artist and is merely the work of the hands. The so-called true technique should be conditional on artistically expressing the spiritual life of the artist to a great extent. The aesthetician Lalo said that the essence of art is a technique. But this technique is definitely not separated from spiritual life, but has the mission of artistically expressing the spiritual life of the artist to a great extent without allowing life to wither, that is concrete creation. Therefore, technique can be said to be a material constraint that makes the spirit express itself in a more realistic way.</p>
<p>Some people say that art should forget technique. But the forgotten technique is dead technique. Isn't the technique with life what we most eagerly desire? Isn't all art using all its strength to negate dead technique and explore its own living technique? Therefore, the true artist spends his life constantly exploring this technique. First, he masters general basic techniques, and then gradually breaks away from them, exploring his own unique technique! A technique without technique. Like the lotus flower in the mud pool, it absorbs all the nutrients and blooms a pure and bright flower. Such a technique is united with the spirit of the artist, and wherever his technique reaches, the spiritual life of the artist is expressed.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Shuren is an artist with such true technique. The lines he uses are so excellent and unrestrained, and are precisely a symbol of his noble personality. And the colors he uses are so bright and calm, precisely expressing the bright and delicate feeling of the southern people. His motives are all taken from nature, but he is not constrained by the external forms of nature, nor does he deliberately make strange deformations, but expresses himself naturally according to his own feelings, and there flows out a rich and subtle poetic meaning! This is the most touching aspect of Mr. Chen's paintings.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen's artistic technique has reached such a unique state, which we can say comes from the observation of nature. In recent times, traditional Chinese painting has reached an impenetrable dead end, which everyone agrees on. To seek a way out for traditional Chinese painting, I think the only way is to abandon the inheritance and imitation of the works of predecessors and explore new paths in nature. The so-called exploring in nature does not mean imitating nature, depicting nature in the same way, but refers to gaining a sense from nature, in other words, discovering oneself and expressing oneself from nature. Unfortunately, most traditional Chinese painters today have not realized this. But Mr. Chen Shuren, the politician and revolutionary, is bravely putting it into practice. In the observation of nature, he has discovered his own unique composition, his own unique lines, his own unique colors, and his own unique poetic meaning. All of these are things that no one else can express.</p>
<p>Introduction: (1) Zhang Junshuren. Skilled in painting. After arriving in Shanghai, those who seek his paintings are constantly lining up.

<h3>Casual Talk from the Di Xiang Zhai Studio</h3>
<p>— Gan Yi</p>
<p>Lin Shaonian</p>
<p>After the Republic, there were those who retreated and hid themselves, and those who hid themselves and advanced. Those who hid themselves and advanced need not be discussed. Among those who retreated and hid themselves, there was one person. His name was Lin Shaonian, courtesy name Zanyu, from Min County, Fujian Province. He was a Jinshi in the Tongzhi Jiaxu year of the Qing Dynasty. He entered the Hanlin Academy and served as a supervising censor in Guangxi. He was renowned in the censorate. He was appointed as the prefect of Zhaotong Prefecture in Yunnan. The area was remote and the position was poor, and many people dissuaded him from going. Shaonian said, "The state establishes officials to govern the people. Since we have become officials, we cannot hastily abandon this and take up other careers. Why ask about the distance, the prosperity or poverty? I will go." So he left. After arriving at his post, he made an agreement with the people to promote benefits and eliminate abuses. After more than a year, he impeached corrupt officials and unscrupulous gentry, and punished cunning clerks and stupid servants. He said, "If these four are not eliminated, the people will not be able to live." For a time, public opinion turned to him. The high officials assessed his performance, and Shaonian was ranked first. He was transferred to the leading prefecture. At that time, Song Fan served as the Governor-General of Yunnan, and Huang Huaisen served as the Governor. They were negligent in governing. Shaonian believed that if the administration of officials was not good, then everything would be ruined. This was the responsibility of the border officials, and those who guarded the territory could not shirk their blame. He should seek a way to reform. Song and Huang pretended to agree but did not really think so. He was eventually rejected for his bluntness. He requested to be formally appointed, and then he was promoted to the Yinan Circuit, but he did not take office. He successively served as the acting financial and judicial commissioners. He was promoted to the Guizhou Surveillance Commissioner, then to the Yunnan Provincial Administration Commissioner, and then transferred to Shanxi. He was promoted to the Governor of Yunnan. He was about to enter the capital for an audience, and when he returned, he was the Governor-General. It had only been more than four years since he became a defender. Shaonian knew everything about Yunnan. In the past, the officials were not highly respected and were not trusted by their superiors. Now that he held a border post, he could do as he wished.

<h3>Financial Standard Gold Fluctuates Greatly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of gold rose sharply, with sellers fighting back vigorously, but it remained within 750 taels throughout the day. The total high and low prices differed by 7 taels, seemingly doubling. Afterwards, it rose again by a few cents. Although the silver market remained unchanged at the beginning of the low opening, the private telegrams' impact was that it violated Rehe afterwards, with two or three tael twists. The exchange within the field was divergent. Because foreign exchange was flat for British and loose for American, those who headed were always throwing out American gold. By noon, the trend was weary, and the market suddenly turned high. In reality, it was because of the fine exchange rate. Although fellow companies threw vigorously, the bank had a good appetite and people's hearts were firm. Especially since the gold bars were running low, and the short-sellers were struggling, the market was reviving. Finally, it almost reached 750 taels. In August, Heng Xing had once dropped from the morning, but posted two taels, etc. Now, the situation of the whole day is recorded as follows.</p>
<p>The silver market opened low in the morning from the early opening of the September price, and fell a little by one tael six qian, which was 747 taels and 5 qian. Big bars and silver prices were as before. Only the private telegrams rose by 16 3/3 cents, and the exchange rate increased again and again. Furthermore, Zhifengyong and foreign merchants, such as Qiaozhifu, sold. Subsequently, it fell to 44 taels and a half. Afterwards, Tongchun, Yifengyong, Tongtaichang, Hengyu, Hengxing, and Yifeng and other firms followed and entered. Also, each bank had absorbed US dollars in August, the price was 875, 30 yuan in September. Furthermore, the banks did British gold recently at 18, so the gold price jumped over three taels. At 9:30, the British gold opening was unchanged, and the US dollar increased by 125, so the exchange rate was greatly squeezed. The price even rose to 47 taels and 8 qian, while the disk only had a few cents to one tael zero. Afterwards, Yuanmaoyong, Hongli, Hongxing, Hengchangyong and Hengxing, etc., came to sell. As for the exchange rates, they were flat. Zhengjin issued British gold at 181875 in October, and Anda bought US dollars at 9375 in August. Therefore, at 9:50, it retreated to 44 taels and 2 qian. Afterwards, there was a fluctuation of one tael or more, but Yuanxingyong, Yifengyong, and Dayufengyong continued to hedge, and the price returned to over two taels, reaching 46 taels and 8 qian at 10:45. Again, with the exchange market loosening, US dollars in August should be sold to the banks for 30 yuan, July for 875, and November even for 375. The British gold can be settled at 0625 in July. Also, because Tongtaichang, Zhifengyong, Wupin, Yuankangxiang, Yuanmaoyong, etc. sold vigorously, it finally reached 42 taels and 5 qian by 11:30. Then it was pulled up by more than one tael, as retail investors covered their shorts, and it became 4 taels and 1 qian. By the closing of the afternoon market, it was 43 taels and 8 qian, and Wupin selling suppressed it again to 3 taels 3 or 4 qian.</p>
<p>Many buyers turned sharply upwards. The initial opening of the afternoon market was 43 taels, followed by a rise from 3 taels and a half to 2 taels and 8 qian. There were not many transactions. Afterwards, it gradually rose because Zhifengyong, Yuanxingyong, Yifeng, Yifengyong, etc., entered strongly. Furthermore, with the improvement of the US dollar, the initial settlement of August was 30 yuan, and then the bank absorbed 30 yuan. Also, the silver companies had a strong desire to buy. In August, it was only 9375, so it rose by two or three taels. At 3 o'clock, it was only 45 taels and 4 qian. After a short while, it was slightly less, about 7 or 8 cents, which was 4 taels and 6 qian. Soon after, it soared. Yuanxingyong, Yifengyong, also hedge-returned for Dayufengyong, and Yuanmaoyong, Richang, Kaitai, Zhifengyong, Yuantai, Futaiheng, etc., scrambled to buy, and US dollars for 30 yuan in September could be sold, and 0625 in October. At 3:45, it was 48 yuan and 3 qian. However, Tongtaichang's selling intention was still strong, and it retreated to 7 taels and 4 qian. Finally, Zhifengyong, Hengyu, Hongxing, Hengxing, Fuyu, etc., continued to enter vigorously. The general short-sellers were greatly disappointed, and the Mitsui absorbed 1875 in November with US dollars, and the silver companies' appetite was not fresh, calculating the purchase from 1875 to 125 in November, and the price soared again by more than 2 taels. By the closing of the market at 4 o'clock, it was 49 taels and a half, slightly higher than the previous day by 4 cents. It had already exceeded the highest point of the previous market, making it unpredictable. After the closing of the market, it rose again to 50 taels. According to the full-day maximum of 49 taels and a half, the minimum of 42 taels and a half, there was a fluctuation of 7 taels (in terms of listed prices). The red bars increased by 9 taels and a half.</p>
<p>Large fluctuations, with double closing prices revealed. The US dollar was listed high at 125, so it was 817 taels, counting 70 taels. It went up to 74 taels, and in the afternoon, it was 73 or 4 taels to 67 taels, which was 4 taels less than the day before yesterday. The accounting had already been done twice (double closing price), 47 taels in the morning, 44 taels, 53 taels in the afternoon, 50 taels, 44 taels for water replenishment, and 50 taels in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Foreign merchant Qiao Shifu resisted selling, and transactions on the table were not fresh. According to statistics, Yuanxingyong, Yifengyong, and Dayufengyong bought over 2,000 bars. Hengyu, Dadecheng, Tongtaichang, Yifeng, and Tongchun, Yuandayong all bought in. Shunli, Zhifengyong, Richang, Yuantai, Yuanmaoyong, and Futaiheng all sold out. Hengxing first bought and then sold. The rest were complex. In the afternoon, Zhifengyong, Yuanxingyong, Yifengyong, Xiexingyong, Yifeng, Yuantai, Hongxing, Futaiheng, Kaitai, and Hengyu all bought in, occasionally to cover the short positions from earlier in the day. Tongtaichang, Hengchangyong, Wupin and general sporadic bulls all sold out. It was heard that Yufengyong was hedging and selling US dollars, and Qiao Shifu was resisting selling, and Mr. Wu also sold in the morning. The overall Dalian gang's ins and outs were not prosperous, while the Guangdong gang, such as Hengxing, sold five or six hundred bars and bought in over a hundred. Yifeng bought in around 1,000 bars.</p>
<h3>Exchange Market British Flat and American Loose</h3>
<p>Hedging transactions are extremely active</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silver market was mediocre, and the exchange rate has risen for three consecutive days, but the numbers are limited. Almost the listing of foreign exchange in this port, with US dollars increasing by 125, a total of 29 yuan and 375 cents, French francs increasing by 2 yuan, German exchange increasing by 25, and the rest such as British gold are still calculated at 1 shilling and 7 3/4 pence, and Indian and Singapore ports, etc., are all unchanged. As for the internal disk of the banks, it was initially loose and then firm, with some circling in between. Because the gold market turned from weakness to firmness, it then trended sharply. In the end, compared to the previous afternoon, the British gold was flat and the US dollar rose slightly by 0.0625. Chinese merchants' transactions were extremely heated. Only 100,000 pounds of British gold were traded, with considerable swaps, and the gold industry had slight inflows and outflows. Foreign merchants settled in, and Mumbai sold out. About one million US dollars were transacted throughout the day, with gold firms such as Shoufengyong vigorously selling out, and then swapping to gold bars, because the swap price was still worthwhile. The settlement price included 70 taels outside, and the banks had a strong desire to buy. Although they frequently sold, they accommodated as much as possible. Also, Citibank always accepted deliveries, so the market seemed slightly firm and profitable. The opening prices are recorded below.</p>
<p>The British exchange internal disk had a difference of 125 throughout the day. In the morning, the selling price was 1 shilling and 8 pence to 125, and the buying price was 0625 to 1875.

Also, the London exchange rate to New York was three dollars and fifty-six and a half cents.</p>
<h3>The Process of Money Market Decline and Interest Rate Increase</h3>
<p>The market atmosphere was very selling yesterday morning, and the banks again made large-scale sales, and the market atmosphere suddenly turned to a major decline. However, looking at the current foreign exchange trend, there is no prosperity to speak of. The process of yesterday's market certainly had unexpected factors. According to people in the industry, the credit crunch caused the money market to soften. Although the statement is roughly similar, it is certainly not so great. After careful interviews, it was learned that this was caused by the bulls escaping.</p>
<p>The foreign money fell sharply and the silver interest rate rose sharply: (Foreign interest rate) Due to a large number of sellers in the early market, the interest rate fell sharply by one and a half cents to 6 cents 9 fen 3 cents. The noon market fell again by 6 hao 2 hu and a half to 6 cents 9 fen 2 cents 3 hao 2 hu and a half. As a result, the total drop between the two markets was more than two cents. (Silver interest rate) 1 cent 2 fen in the early market, and 1 cent 1 fen in the noon market, which was slightly less than the previous day by 5 fen. The bank's listing was 5 fen, and the scratch head plus water was 1 cent 89 fen.</p>
<p>Jiangnan small foreign currency plummeted by 9 cents: The Jiangnan small foreign currency suddenly plummeted. The early market fell by a small 4 cents, which was 6 cents and 5 cents. The noon market fell by another 5 cents, which was 6 cents zero. The total drop between the two markets was as much as 9 cents. The transaction was 5,000 jiao in the early market and 2,000 jiao in the noon market. Guangdong small foreign currency also fell by 1 cent and a half in the early market, which was 5 cents 8 fen 9 cents. The noon market improved by half a cent, which was 5 cents 8 fen 9 cents and a half. The transaction was 105,000 jiao in the early market and 40,000 jiao in the noon market. Copper coins shrank by 500 wen to 424,000 wen. The transaction was over 39,000 strings.</p>
<p>The receipt and delivery of silver notes was slightly more complicated: Yesterday, the bank's receipt and delivery seemed slightly better than the previous day. Chinese merchants' receipt and delivery of notes was 1.34 million, and foreign merchants' receipt and delivery of notes was 2.45 million. Mortgage transactions were 1.1 million. The receipt and delivery of various goods, exchange taxes, and miscellaneous items was 9.3 million. Special items were 1.5 million. Telegraphic transfer items were 900,000. Warehousing was 1.3 million. Money shops and silver public orders received and delivered over 27 million. Silver scratch head items received and delivered over 4.7 million. Various road exchange items were 700,000. Cash delivery was over 1 million.</p>
<p>Foreign currency transactions were strong in the morning and weak in the afternoon: In the early market, exchange notes amounted to 1.045 million, which was better than the previous day by a factor of one. The noon market decreased to only 595,000. Paper money was 75,000 in the early market and 40,000 in the noon market. Off-market paper money was 145,000 in the early market and 65,000 in the noon market. Check transactions were 20,000. Bank buying and selling inflows and outflows were 900,000 in the early market and 500,000 in the noon market. Money shop foreign public orders received and delivered over 5.1 million, foreign scratch head items received and delivered over 2.1 million. Foreign currency borrowing inflows and outflows were over 1.9 million. Small money shop transactions were 600,000 to 700,000.</p>
<h3>Securities and Bond Market Under Heavy Pressure</h3>
<p>Reorganization Bonds Plummet by More Than Two Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 21st), at the China Merchants Securities Exchange, morning trading volume for spot goods remained sparse. Only Reorganization bonds were traded for 2,000 yuan, the 1919 Customs Bonds for 1,000 yuan, and no other transactions occurred. Futures trading, however, saw significant changes, with a considerable drop compared to the previous day. The market was active, with buyer and seller interest even stronger than before. Opening trading reached approximately 4 million yuan, and the second session reached 3 million yuan, totaling 6,935,000 yuan. Among these, Salt Tax Reorganization bonds each reached over 1.3 million yuan, and the 1920 Consolidated Tax bonds also reached approximately 1.1 million yuan each. The remaining categories each totaled 500,000 to 600,000 yuan, except for the Disbandment bonds, which only reached over 200,000 yuan, and the Consolidated Customs Tax bonds, which only reached 70,000 to 80,000 yuan each. As for price fluctuations of the various bonds, due to the unfavorable situation and the market's weak confidence, selling was extremely active. However, aside from short sellers covering their profits, there was very little new investment. As a result, supply and demand were drastically unbalanced, and the prices of all bonds plummeted sharply upon opening, then became chaotic and entered a swirling state. Ultimately, Reorganization bonds continued to fall by more than two yuan, while others fell by approximately one yuan to one yuan, six or seven jiao. Looking at the bond market's situation, it is still difficult to be optimistic and will depend on the diplomatic situation for a turnaround.</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Rebounds</h3>
<p>The New York Stock Exchange opened quietly on Wednesday, but after various positive news spread, buyers rushed in, and short sellers quickly covered their positions. Consequently, the market advanced significantly in one day. The rapid increase in railway stocks was unprecedented in recent weeks. After several industrial companies released their June operating reports on the same day, the actual results were not as bad as expected. Moreover, railway companies disclosed that they would enjoy equal opportunities to overcome the economic crisis. Therefore, railway stocks remained strong throughout Wednesday, significantly impacting sentiment. Based on recent market conditions, the stock market is expected to gradually improve in the coming days. The Dow Jones Index for Wednesday is attached below:</p>
<p>| Date | July 19th | July 20th | Change |</p>

<h3>Yarn, Raw Cotton, and Cloth Gradually Improving</h3>
<p>Summer Yarn Trading Suspended in Afternoon</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market is advancing towards higher prices because foreign cotton is also showing signs of stabilization. Moreover, the Hua Nan area is actively seeking spot yarn, and the factory's July and August goods have been almost entirely absorbed. They are also eagerly purchasing yarn for October, causing the factory's inventory to dwindle daily and greatly boosting confidence. Sellers are gradually considering covering their positions, making the market increasingly tight. Some observers believe that the Japanese bombing of Chaoyang and the emergency in Rehe may lead to further sales of local yarn. Therefore, the situation is especially strong. However, apart from the southern region, other areas remain inactive. Generally speaking, there are currently too many retail investors, and the actual demand needs to pick up. There is still potential for price increases, but the overseas yarn market remains calm.</p>
<p>People's Standard (Ren Biao) Rises After Falling</p>
<p>The People's Standard (Ren Biao) market opened flat, with foreign cotton slightly lower. Later, news of strong buying from the Guangdong region boosted confidence again, and prices for all months rose by three, four, five, or six qian. 15,200 bales were traded. Due to the exceptionally hot weather, which is different from the past, the afternoon session has been temporarily suspended since the day before yesterday, with only half-day morning sessions until August 2nd. Furthermore, 850 bales of Yongchang, 600 bales of Yichang, 550 bales of Yuda, 450 bales of Dachangcheng, and 450 bales of Senkang were sold. 950 bales of Changfeng, 500 bales of Xiesheng, 400 bales of Yongda, 400 bales of Renfeng, 450 bales of Gengfeng, and 400 bales of Jifeng were bought. The closing prices for the People's Standard are listed separately below:</p>
<p>| Standard (Ren Biao) | Closing (Rise/Fall) | Inventory (Bales) |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| 10 (October) | 1468 (Up 4) | 77,550 |</p>
<p>| 7 (July) | 1453 (Up 6) | 10,950 |</p>
<p>| 11 (November) | 1469 (Up 5) | 80,650 |</p>
<p>| 8 (August) | 1464 (Up 3) | 34,900 |</p>
<p>| 11 (November) | 1470 (Up 5) | 50,200 |</p>
<p>| 9 (September) | 1467 (Up 3) | 58,600 |</p>
<p>| **Total** |  | **312,900** |</p>
<p>Guangdong Merchants are the Strongest Buyers of Yarn</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are quite strong, and shipments to the southern ports are healthy. A total of 7,300 bales of both forward and spot goods were purchased by various merchants throughout the day, with prices rising by five qian to one liang. The previous day, various merchants purchased 2,700 bales. The breakdown of bales purchased by each merchant is listed below:</p>
<p>| Merchant | Bales |</p>
<p>|---|---|</p>
<p>| Guangdong | 5,460 |</p>
<p>| Jiangxi | 50 |</p>
<p>| Changsha | 300 |</p>
<p>| Inland | 200 |</p>
<p>| Yunnan | 100 |</p>
<p>| Sichuan | 620 |</p>
<p>| Shantou | 250 |</p>
<p>| Fellow Traders | 160 |</p>
<h3>Cotton Loiters Without Advancing</h3>
<p>The cotton market is mediocre and lacks distinct features, with a calm situation. Due to the depletion of local cotton inventory, confidence is strong, and actual demand is relatively active. Although factories do not have large-scale buying intentions, small-scale needs are constantly being met. However, major sellers are focused on the stabilization of American cotton and seem eager to sell, so pressure remains high. The future depends on the fluctuations of American cotton.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard (Zheng Biao) Lacks Buyers</p>
<p>The Zheng Standard (Zheng Biao) market opened weaker due to another drop in American cotton, leading to soft sentiment and a slight decrease in buyers. Gold prices fell, and prices for all months also fell by five fen to one qian five fen. 28,700 dan were traded. 1,600 dan of Jifeng, 4,600 dan of Dafeng, and 1,600 dan of Shenchang were sold. 2,100 dan of Xiesheng, 1,300 dan of Changhe, 800 dan of Dachang, 800 dan of Yiyu, 1,100 dan of Changfeng, 800 dan of Tongfu, and 700 dan of Yicheng were bought. The closing prices for the Zheng Standard are listed separately below:</p>
<p>| Zheng Standard (Zheng Biao) | Closing (Rise/Fall) | Inventory (Dan) |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| 11 (November) | 3085 (Down 15) | 183,900 |</p>
<p>| 7 (July) | 3065 (Up 5) | 36,000 |</p>
<p>| 12 (December) | 3085 (Down 15) | 342,400 |</p>
<p>| 8 (August) | 3095 (Down 10) | 98,300 |</p>
<p>| **Total** |  | **626,100** |</p>
<p>| 10 (October) | 3080 (Down 20) | 165,500 |</p>
<p>Small Turnaround in Spot Sales</p>
<p>Spot cotton trading is relatively active, and factories have a slight appetite for purchases. The sources of supply include 32 bales of Yao cotton. The selling prices are listed below:</p>
<p>| Cotton Type | Price | Buyer | Remarks |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| Tianjin American Cotton | 32.50 | Dacheng Jin | 143 pieces (Sent to Changzhou) |</p>
<p>|  | 31.60 |  | 107 pieces (Sent to Changzhou) |</p>
<p>| Lingbao Cotton (Warehouse Delivery) | 33.10 |  | 100 pieces (Sent to Changzhou) |</p>
<p>| Zhengzhou Cotton | 30.90 | Su Lun Jin | 200 pieces (Sent to Suzhou) |</p>
<p>| Shaanxi Cotton | 3.035 |  | 103 pieces (Sent to Suzhou) |</p>
<h3>American Cotton Trends Soft Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton weakened due to favorable harvest conditions and poor news from Liverpool, with fewer buyers. Futures fell by eight to eleven points, and spot prices fell by five points. English cotton futures rose and fell by one point, and spot prices rose by five points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by fifteen points. Indian cotton initially rose with American cotton but then softened due to large-scale speculative selling and profit-taking by long positions. Pingguoer rose by 1.5 rupees, Aomula rose by 1.75 rupees, and Bairoxi remained unchanged. The original telegraph records are on the left (telegraph from the 20th):</p>

<h3>Grain and River Rice Market Steady</h3>
<p>Zhoupu New Indica Rice Arrives in Shanghai Soon</p>
<p>Yesterday, about a dozen boats arrived in southern Shanghai, but there was little inventory left in the ports. Retail sales in urban and rural stores have been slowing down. Because there is a large amount of foreign rice stored, the Social Affairs Bureau sent personnel to investigate yesterday. The actual amount is 1.25 million (units), so public sentiment is steady. Changshu and Xibei indica rice and the Sutong merchants' rice are arriving and selling at a moderate pace, with no price fluctuations. There is a shortage of early and late indica rice, and opening prices rose slightly by five fen. There are few shipments of Luyang fine rice, and prices are also rising.</p>
<p>At Xinzha yesterday, the supply to the rice market on the west road was limited. Because the weather is extremely hot, buyers are adopting a cautious attitude. The opening prices of Kunshan and Liyang rice were lowered by one chi. There are only scattered lots of Chang merchants' top-grade goods, and the situation is steady. Early thin indica rice and foreign Dujian rice are lacking. According to news from Zhoupu, the new indica rice from Pudong will arrive in Shanghai within one or two days.</p>
<h3>Middle and Lower Grades of Foreign Rice Flour Drop Slightly by Three to Five Fen</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market was somewhat improved, as Ningbo merchants still had a strong appetite. Tianjin merchants also bought 500 bags of fine rice flour as a trial. Local inland retailers were also inquiring about it, so the higher-grade goods were slightly stronger. The owners of the middle and lower grades were eager to sell due to concerns about spoilage in the hot weather, so market prices could not turn around. The lower grades fell slightly by three to five fen, in contrast to the rising trend of the higher-grade fine rice flour. As a result, over 2,000 bags of new fine rice flour were traded throughout the city, priced at 9.20 to 9.00 yuan. Middle and lower grades were priced at 8.95 to 8.80 yuan. 4,000 bags of old fine rice flour were priced at 8.75 yuan, and they were all purchased by Ningbo merchants. In addition to the Tianjin merchants, the new fine rice flour was also purchased by Zhenjiang, inland, and local merchants. 200 bags of red fine rice flour were also purchased by local merchants, priced at 7.91 yuan.</p>
<h3>Very Few New Transactions in the Flour Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, prices for all months were generally stable. Because there were discrepancies in foreign wheat quotations, the market was quiet, and there were few new transactions. Because factories were holding back and unwilling to sell freely, merchants from the north had no interest in benchmarks due to the situation. When there was a sale, they would buy spot goods, so the market was stagnant, which was quite puzzling (it was heard that Tianjin merchants had made a deal for spot goods priced at one liang, nine qian, and two and a half fen, but the details are not yet known). As a result, the price for the current month was slightly down five li from the previous day, August and September were down two and a half li, October was up two and a half li, November was unchanged, and December was up two and a half li.</p>
<h3>Many Short Positions in This Month's Wheat Contracts Have Already Been Closed</h3>
<p>Grain Exchange Suspends Afternoon Trading</p>
<p>After the futures wheat market opened yesterday morning, prices for all months showed a trend of near-term weakness and far-term stability. Although there was a short squeeze in the current month, most short positions are inactive and are generally prepared for delivery. Most large holders have also not exited, so both sides are holding back. However, more short positions among general floating traders are gradually being closed, causing the market to weaken. It was also down three fen from the previous day, August was also down one fen, and the rest were unchanged. The afternoon session was suspended due to the hot weather, as decided in the morning, from today until August 14. The spot wheat market remains stable, and factory demand is active. The opening price for Zhizhang and Tang wheat was two liang, nine qian, and six fen, secondary to eight qian and five fen. Penglai wheat was two liang, seven qian, and three fen, secondary to six qian and eight fen. Jiading wheat was two liang, seven qian, and six fen. Lujiabang wheat was two liang, eight qian, and five fen, secondary to eight qian and two fen. Taicang arrivals totaled 2,500 bags.</p>
<p>[P Sugar Market Crude and White Sugar Markets Become Quiet</p>
<p>Taikoo Sugar Trading Active</p>
<p>Yesterday, trading at the Sugar Market Association was sluggish, but sentiment was steady. Dutch 24 crude white sugar remained at 14 liang and 4 qian, and ordinary goods were at 14 liang and 3 qian. Dutch 8 red oil bag goods were priced at 10 liang and 4 qian, but buying interest was very quiet, and the market was stable. Although Taikoo sugar trading was active, sales were limited because demand in various places was not smooth, so transaction volumes were very scattered. B mark was at 16 liang and 3 qian, CW mark was at 15 liang and 8 qian, Yantai CX mark was at 15 liang and 5 qian and a half, DY mark was at 15 liang and 5 qian, HX mark was at 15 liang and 3 qian and a half, HM mark was at 14 liang and 9 qian, H mark was at 12 liang and 6 qian, and PX mark was at 11 liang and 2 qian. Although there were few price changes from the previous day, the market was quite active, showing a trend of breaking the sluggishness.</p>
<h3>Dried Goods, New Glutinous Rice Branches Arrive in Shanghai for the First Time</h3>
<p>Opening at 81 Liang and 8 Qian</p>
<p>Glutinous rice branches produced in Guangdong are sweet and palatable. Due to crop failures last year, there were few arrivals, but this year's harvest is good. The first batch of goods arrived in Shanghai yesterday, and South City dealers invited various merchants to open trading in the afternoon. There were only ten pieces, and the quality was good. They were sold at 81 liang and 8 qian. If more arrive later, prices may ease.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Yellow and White Factory-Reeled Silk Sales Slow, Prices Weaken</h3>
<p>The local foreign silk market is almost stagnant. Only the English and Indian merchants have some scattered transactions to cover short positions. Cloth merchants' sales have also slowed down. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson bought ten bales of Yue Tu brand (13-15 denier) Shanghai white factory-reeled silk at 560 liang. Asia Merchant bought five bales of medium B grade (18-22 denier) Shanghai white factory-reeled silk at 480 liang. Anli bought five bales of Tie Ji brand (13-15 denier) Sichuan yellow factory-reeled silk at 540 liang. Samsung bought three bales of Xiao Che brand (13-15 denier) Sichuan yellow factory-reeled silk at 420 liang.</p>
<h3>Needle and Eyebrow Green Tea Sales to Europe Continue to be Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday, various European merchants showed strong interest in needle and eyebrow green tea from Wuyuan and Tunxi, and trading was brisk. Arrivals were quickly snapped up. Gongxi, the highest-grade tea from Wuyuan, was particularly popular. Yesterday, Ruichang Foreign Firm bought Yifang Yong brand at a price of 130 liang, the highest price in recent years. Lower-grade goods from Yushan and Wenzhou were also selling well. However, mid-grade goods are stagnant as Russian merchants are watching and pushing down prices. Other items such as Zhenmei Pearl Tea and Dabang are showing signs of activity.</p>
<p>[P Coal Hot Weather Causes Sluggish Coal Sales</p>
<p>Due to the recent hot weather, the demand for coal has decreased sharply. Few people are attending the market each day, so coal trading is very sluggish. Yesterday, the total sales of various goods throughout the city were less than 2,000 tons, and coal prices were generally weak. Songpu bituminous coal blocks sold for nine liang before customs per ton but only eight liang and seven qian and a half after customs. Shen Tian and Yuanshan blocks also fell by three or four qian.</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>Zeng Zhongming Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Central Government Decides to Delay Resistance Against Japan</p>
<p>Zeng Seeks Opinions from Various Important Figures</p>
<p>The Japanese army has launched a large-scale invasion of Rehe, and the war clouds over North China are intensifying. The central government, recognizing the gravity of the situation and the need to gather diverse opinions, sent Tie Daohui Zhongming to Shanghai on the night before last to solicit views from various parties. Zeng arrived at the port at 8:00 AM yesterday and immediately visited Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo and former Minister of Communications Chen Mingshu, holding discussions throughout the day. He then returned to the capital by overnight train to report on his findings. A reporter from the Hua Dong News Agency interviewed Zeng yesterday. According to Zeng, upon receiving reports of the Japanese army's large-scale invasion of Rehe, the central government immediately convened an emergency meeting of key figures in the capital. It was resolved that the Japanese army's barbaric and unreasonable actions could not be tolerated any longer, as further appeasement would lead to further Japanese aggression and a critical situation in North China. Therefore, it was decided to order the Pacification Commissioner of Beiping to resist immediately and to provide swift assistance to Rehe. The central government also resolved to respond with all its strength. Zeng stated that his trip had no specific mission but was merely to engage in brief consultations with key figures remaining in Shanghai. He was scheduled to return to the capital tonight (i.e., last night). When asked about rumors that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek was returning to the capital from Wuhan due to the emergency in North China, and that President Wang Jingwei was traveling to Beiping, Zeng stated that Chairman Chiang was in Wuhan directing the suppression of bandits and had no plans to return to the capital. President Wang was in the capital overseeing government affairs and saw no need to travel to Beiping in the face of the current diplomatic emergency.</p>
<h3>Chen and Kong Postpone Their Overseas Trips</h3>
<p>Former Minister of Communications Chen Mingshu, who had been resting in Shanghai since resigning from his position, had intended to take this opportunity to visit various places in Southeast Asia, Europe, and the Americas to study the political and social conditions of different countries. He had also planned to depart on the President Jackson on the 23rd of this month, and his ticket had already been booked. However, it has been learned that Chen's trip, which required passing through various colonies in Southeast Asia, necessitated obtaining visas with signatures from the respective countries' authorities, a process that was extremely complicated. Furthermore, the American documents had not yet arrived. According to a telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs received by Chen yesterday, there would be a delay of at least four or five days before the trip could proceed. Chen's luggage is already packed, and he is awaiting the arrival of his passport before departing. He will be accompanied by three secretaries. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency has also learned that Chen's overseas inspection trip has been postponed not only due to passport issues but also due to a potential reluctance to leave the country altogether. The reason for this is the sudden escalation of the situation in Rehe in recent days. The Japanese invaders are not only attempting to seize Rehe by force but are also eyeing Beiping and Tianjin. Therefore, the central government has resolved to prepare for active resistance. Yesterday, President Wang Jingwei sent a personal letter, delivered by Minister of Railways Zeng Zhongming, to Chen. Zeng Zhongming, upon arriving in Shanghai yesterday morning, visited Chen at 10:30 AM, accompanied by Madam Wang (Chen Bijun) and Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo, and engaged in lengthy discussions. It is said that President Wang urged Chen not to travel abroad for the time being, given the increasingly serious situation in Northeast China and the escalating national crisis. He also invited Chen to travel to the capital within days to discuss countermeasures. It is reported that Chen himself is angered by the Japanese's relentless encroachment and has decided to cancel his overseas trip. It is possible that he will travel to the capital within days.</p>
<p>Kong Xiangxi, the special envoy for investigating industry in Europe and America, originally planned to depart today but has postponed his trip to the 25th due to unresolved matters in Shanghai. He will travel to Europe and America on the Dollar Steamship Lines' President Madison. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, former Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Zhengting and former Vice Minister of Industry Zhao Jinqing hosted a tea party at Chen Bingqian's residence at 6 Seymour Road to bid farewell to Kong. They invited key figures from China and abroad to attend, including Wu Tiecheng, Zheng Hongnian, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Xu Ji, Lin Kanghou, Chen Shiguang, Merlo, Okazaki, Yan Shenyu, Rong Zongjing, Wang Jingqi, Chen Zeqing, and over a hundred others. The hosts, Wang and Zhao, greeted the guests separately. The event concluded around 6:00 PM. The Shanghai Local Association also hosted a farewell banquet at its headquarters on Jingan Temple Road yesterday afternoon at 6:30 PM, attended by Shi Liangcai, Du Yuesheng, and others. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves until around 8:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Various Organizations and Patriotic Associations Wire Urge Pingzhang to Send Troops</h3>
<p>The Joint Association of Various Organizations and Patriotic Associations wired Zhang Xueliang yesterday, stating: "To Director Zhang Hanqing of Beiping, The brutal Japanese have already occupied the Northeast and will inevitably attempt to seize Rehe and overlook Beiping and Tianjin to fulfill their plot to dismember China. With your wisdom and insight, you must have deeply considered and prepared for this. But why is it that signals of alarm from beyond the Great Wall are spreading, yet you still hesitate to advance your troops and remain in observation? The key to military strategy lies in seizing the initiative. Hesitation leads to defeat. Hopefully, you will select brave troops and eliminate the ruthless enemy, deciding the fate of the nation in one fell swoop and determining your personal merits and demerits for eternity. The advantages and disadvantages are crystal clear. If reservations arise and the same mistakes are repeated, there will soon be a day when it is too late to regret. The decision rests with you. This urgent telegram conveys our utmost anxiety for the nation."</p>
<h3>Urgent Telegram from the Postal Workers' Union</h3>
<p>Japanese Troops Invade Rehe, Expedite the Decision of Major Plans</p>
<p>The National Postal Workers' Union wired the Central Government yesterday, stating: "To Chairman Lin Sen of the National Government, President Wang Jingwei of the Executive Yuan, and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the Military Affairs Commission, The severity of the Japanese invasion of China, which concerns the life and death of China, is not merely a localized Sino-Japanese dispute involving the loss of rights and the humiliation of the nation. From the September 18th Incident in Shenyang to the Battle of Shanghai, and up to the establishment of the puppet state, its venomous flames have grown increasingly fierce and insatiable, acting recklessly and without limit. Recently, it has disregarded all international norms, sending troops to invade Rehe and bombing Chaoyang, intending to invade within the Great Wall in order to realize its dream of a continental policy. At a time when bandits and external aggressors are rising together, Your Government should engage in comprehensive planning. The so-called long-term resistance must not be empty talk. Rehe is a key hub for our internal defense. It is not only related to national rights and territory, which we must fight for, but also a strategically important obstacle for the survival of the Chinese nation in military terms. It is critical to the success or failure of long-term resistance in the future. To protect our territory, we should immediately send troops to defend it. To engage in long-term resistance, we should actively defend ourselves as a key to recovering lost territory in the Northeast in the future and to lay the foundation for [ blank ] long-term resistance. Your Government's officials surely have [ blank ] aspirations and will not wait for the [ blank ] of this Union. As the general group of postal workers across the country, we are anxious day and night about rescuing the nation and averting danger. Now, as foreign aggression encroaches, we dare not refrain from respectfully presenting our views to the authorities, urging you to expedite the decision of major plans and not be hindered by difficulties again. Act decisively without delay. We await your orders with utmost anticipation. Sincerely, The National Postal Workers' Union of Shanghai."</p>
<h3>Blocking the Northeast Customs, Awaiting Song's Decision in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The issue of blocking the Northeast Customs is now becoming increasingly tense. The final warning issued by Chief Tidesurveyor Maze to the Japanese embassy has been over a week ago. The Japanese government, considering the international situation and feeling unable to cope with the uncontrolled Japanese warlords occupying Manchuria, has not yet issued a reply. According to sources from the customs authorities yesterday, our reporter learned that the issue of blocking all Northeast Customs is now awaiting the final decision of Finance Minister Song Ziwen in Shanghai. The blockade is inevitable. Minister Song is expected to arrive in Shanghai today or tomorrow.</p>
<h3>The National Salvation Federation Issued a Declaration of Unity Yesterday</h3>
<p>Urging the Government to Recover Lost Territory in the Northeast</p>
<p>Implementing Total Mobilization to Fight for Final Victory</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Beiping and other groups' National Salvation Federation has been actively preparing for the establishment of a National Federation of National Salvation Groups, it has gradually been completed. The federation has also set up a preparatory office at No. 89 Ren'an Lane, Guling Road. Yesterday, the federation specially issued a preparatory declaration of unity, addressed to the National Salvation Associations, Chambers of Commerce, Labor Unions, Educational Associations, Lawyers' Associations, and newspaper offices of all provinces and cities, as well as the National Salvation Federation groups at No. 11 Hongluochang, Xisipailou, Beiping, the National Salvation Federation groups at Li's residence, No. 14 Road, British Concession, Tianjin, and the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of all circles in the capital Nanjing, and for public review by all groups. In recent years, China has been subjected to political and economic oppression by imperialist powers, falling into a semi-colonial position, almost to the point of complete collapse. The main reason for this is the lack of a spirit of national unity, which has led to the worsening of foreign aggression. Japan has been vigorously pursuing its traditional policy of aggression against China, engaging in Manchuria for decades. The September 18th Incident of last year was by no means accidental. The local military authorities abandoned the three northeastern provinces with non-resistance, and the central government has had no definitive</p>
<p>plan from the beginning to recover them. The people of the country were filled with grief and anger, rising up in a national salvation movement. The day the 19th Route Army shed blood in Shanghai was the time when the spirit of the Chinese nation was ignited. If the country has people who can practice the so-called belief of spiritual unity, uniting from top to bottom, and gathering the will of the people to form a stronghold, then even if the violent Japan is strong, what can it do to us? However, the government attempted a temporary local appeasement, not hesitating to sacrifice rights and humiliate the country, signing the Shanghai Truce Agreement, allowing the puppet state to be completed, with empty talk and deception. Customs and postal services have been successively seized. To this day, Rehe is in a state of emergency, and Peiping and Tianjin are in danger. If this continues, the country will no longer be a country. Our association gathers representatives from people's groups in various provinces and cities, based on the long-cherished wish of resisting Japan and saving the country, seeking the overall unity of the nation, urging the government to recover the lost territory in the Northeast by force, implementing national mobilization, and striving for final victory. This heart and this ambition, we are willing to share with compatriots across the country. This is our declaration, the Preparatory Committee of the National Federation of National Salvation Groups bows.</p>
<h3>Zhu Qinglan and Others Return to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The People Are Determined to Abolish War, This Trip Was Very Satisfactory</p>
<p>Chen Jitang Gave a Solemn Report on the Course of the Guangdong Incident</p>
<p>The representatives of the Great Alliance for the Abolition of Internal Wars, Zhu Qinglan, Zha Liangzhao,</p>
<p>and Chen Liting, went to Guangdong to appeal for peace. Although the authorities treated it indifferently, the people of Hong Kong, Guangdong, and Macau warmly welcomed them. They also invited Zhu and others to discuss ways to rescue the Northeast on several occasions. Now, Zhu and others returned to Shanghai on the President Hoover yesterday afternoon and gave important talks to news agency reporters, and Chen Jitang gave a written report on the course of the Guangdong Incident. The details are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Joint Talk The three representatives, Zhu, Cha, and Chen, issued a joint talk as follows: The people and others were entrusted by the preparatory committee of the Great Alliance for the Abolition of Internal Wars to go south for a total of thirteen days. In addition to the six days of travel, they stayed in Guangdong and Macau for a total of seven days. Everywhere they went, they received a warm welcome. The people called them peace envoys, and their desire for peace can be imagined. Seeing this kind of expression of the people's spirit, we are even more convinced that the abolition of internal wars is a national salvation movement that arises in response to the times and cannot be delayed. The country must work hard to do it, and its effectiveness is indescribable. This time, in various places, in addition to contacting a small number of important people, we especially emphasize discussion with commercial, industrial, and social groups, and we can all be open and honest, recognizing that internal unity and external resistance are the urgent tasks of today, and are willing to sacrifice everything and participate with strength. This is in terms of the people. The government officials, on the other hand, have slightly different views. The so-called benevolent see benevolence, and the wise see wisdom. There is no shortage of people who enthusiastically approve, such as Li Zongren and Cai Tingkai, who have made practical expressions. But those who take a bystander and skeptical attitude are also unavoidable. Mr. Xiao Focheng openly asked what the two words "internal war" mean, and whether unity and unity are for national salvation or for selling out the country. Others are afraid that the movement to abolish internal wars has other effects, or is specifically for the recent Guangdong incident. All these misunderstandings are caused by the distance and isolation and different environments. Once explained, they will be completely resolved. Finally, Commander Chen Jitang also made a written explanation, detailing the course of the Guangdong incident, the content of which is mostly unknown to us, and the people of the country should be happy to refer to it. In short, we believe that this trip is satisfactory. Both government officials and the people are aware of the abolition of internal wars. If all parties can be open and honest and treat each other with sincerity, then eliminating internal disputes is not difficult to achieve. The people, of course, hope very much, and whether government officials can be consistent depends on the people's ability to urge.</p>
<p>Chen's Letter to Zhu After Zhu, Cha, and Chen met with Chen Jitang, Chen, in addition to explaining the course of the Guangdong incident to Zhu and others orally, also gave a solemn report in writing. The original letter was more than a thousand words long and has been seen in the Hong Kong newspapers. Now, we will select and describe its main points as follows: (1) The Shanghai Alliance for the Abolition of War has repeatedly telegraphed to appeal for the cessation of war. The reason why it has not been able to reply is that the reorganization of the navy and air force is a decision of the Southeast Political Council. The executor of the order of a group is not an individual act, let alone an act of the army, navy, and air force, so there is no need to reply in the name of an individual. (2) Since the establishment of the Air Force Headquarters, the internal unity has become worse than before. The finances are not transparent, and the chief of the military supplies department and others embezzle public funds. It is inevitable to decide to change the affiliation. (3) The Navy Headquarters has huge expenses, and peacetime consumption is no different from wartime. When ordered to suppress bandits, they often refuse, and they do everything possible to smuggle opium and private salt for personal gain. The political council has no choice but to thoroughly reorganize it, he said.</p>
<h3>Overview of the City's Finances in the 20th Year</h3>
<p>Deficit of Approximately One Million Yuan</p>
<p>Since the city has been affected by the war, government revenue has fallen sharply. Although it is said that we have tried our best to tighten our belts, there is still a deficit in offsetting revenue and expenditure. According to Chen Huidi, secretary of the Finance Bureau, the overview of the city's finances in the 20th year is as follows:</p>
<p>Overview of Income and Expenditure According to the estimates of various agencies, the total income of the city in the 20th year is more than 7 million yuan. After deducting party affairs expenses, debt expenses, assistance expenses, etc., totaling approximately 2 million yuan from the total income, only more than 5 million yuan is available for the current expenses of various agencies. Distributed by percentage, the municipal government accounts for 45%, finance accounts for 6.6%, health accounts for 5%, public utilities account for 6.6%, land accounts for 7.4%, public security accounts for 27.6%, education accounts for 21.7%, public works accounts for 15.8%, and society accounts for 4.8%. However, because the central government's approval of the expenditure estimates was delayed, they were not implemented and were still paid according to the old budget of the 19th year. However, due to the actual development of the business, many additional approvals have been granted one after another, which is similar to the new budget. Now that the 20th year has just ended, the city treasury's income and expenditure accounts have not yet been closed. All the actual income and expenditure analysis details are still difficult to understand. However, the total annual income is approximately 8 million yuan, and the total expenditure is approximately 9 million yuan. Including the transfer accounts, the city treasury has always had a unified income and expenditure system, and there is a deficit of approximately 1 million yuan. This deficit must be transferred to the next year to make up for it. The reason for the sharp decline in tax revenue in this city is entirely due to the occurrence of the January 28th Incident. Although the municipal government has repeatedly implemented austerity policies and drastically reduced various expenses, special expenses and after-sales expenses have increased sharply as a result. To deal with, cost-effective regulations, etc.</p>
<p>In addition, Zhou, the deputy director of the Business Tax Collection Office, announced the situation of the business tax as follows:</p>
<p>The Situation of Business Tax Since July 1st of last year, when the collection of business tax in this city was entrusted to the city's Chamber of Commerce to transfer to the public associations of various industries, most merchants have been able to comply with the regulations. However, most of the shops in this city have not joined the same industry association. It seems to be more difficult for the city's Chamber of Commerce to collect business tax from shops that have not joined the same industry association. Now, Wang Yansong, the representative of the city's Chamber of Commerce who went to Beijing to petition, has requested the central government to order all shops to join the same industry association. If this matter can be done, it will have a great relationship on the unity of the business community itself, and it will also greatly facilitate the collection of business tax in this city. As for the collection situation last year, the collection performance was good in the summer and autumn seasons.</p>
<p>In the winter and spring seasons, because this city was affected by the war, the Finance Bureau has notified the City Chamber of Commerce to exempt all business tax. According to the survey results last year, the amount of business tax collected in this city, if fully collected, can be as much as two or three hundred thousand per month. Foreigners are not included. The problem of collecting foreign business tax, now specializing in the body, must wait until the city government negotiates properly with the various leaders before it can begin to collect.</p>
<h3>Chinese Workers in British Merchant Jardine Matheson's Factories Go on Strike</h3>
<p>Resumed Work in the Afternoon After Persuasion by Party and Government Agencies</p>
<p>All Chinese workers in British merchant Jardine Matheson's Old Dock, including the Hefeng Machinery Factory, went on strike in protest of hiring new workers. The Pudong Factory (Xiangsheng) joined in the morning yesterday, and the situation was serious. Party and government agencies sent personnel to persuade them, and they fully resumed work last night. The details of each situation are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Cause of the Strike The labor and management of Jardine Matheson's Old Dock, including the Jardine Matheson Shipyard on Broadway Road, the Dongjiadu Dock, the Pudong Xiangsheng Iron Factory, and the Yangjing Hefeng Machinery Factory, signed a contract. Recently, the foreman of the Hefeng Factory's cold work department contracted the construction of a ship to Zhu Jinfa, the foreman of the Jiangnan Shipyard. The foreman hired new workers to work, which caused panic among the old workers in the cold work department, who believed that the contract was broken. They negotiated with foreman Zhu Jinfa a few days ago, and a conflict occurred. The police officers of the Third District and Second Branch stopped it and detained the leaders for questioning at the police station, and then released them.</p>

<p>Successive Strikes All workers in the Yangjing Hefeng Machinery Factory went on strike together the day before yesterday (20th), which caused the work of various departments to be completely stopped. All workers in the Old Dock on Broadway Road, the Pudong Factory, and the Dongjiadu Dock gathered to help. The Pudong Factory (Xiangsheng) took the lead in going on strike yesterday morning. The two docks on Dongjiadu and Broadway Road are preparing everything. The Shipbuilding Industry Union in the Fifth District is deeply afraid of the expansion of the strike, and yesterday morning sent Director Zhang Linhua and others to the City Party Department and the Social Bureau to request a quick settlement.</p>
<p>Party and Government Mediation The City Party Department yesterday morning at 10:00, specially sent Yu Zhongbiao, together with Zhu Guilin and Zhu Jintao of the City Social Bureau, to the Jardine Matheson Factory on Broadway Road to persuade all workers to resume work immediately. The labor-management dispute will be waited for the party and government agencies to mediate according to law, and together with the union Zhang Linhua and others, discuss the solution with the general foreman Peng Si (translation). The general foreman stated that he would fully comply with the labor-management contract. As a result, the cold work department of the Hefeng Factory will use the bidding method for the subsequent contracting of each ship.</p>
<p>Resumed Work in the Afternoon The representatives of the party and government agencies, together with the representatives of the Shipbuilding Industry Union in the Fifth District, went to the Pudong Factory at 12:00 yesterday morning to report the negotiation process to the workers and persuaded them to resume work immediately. All the workers accepted the persuasion. At 1:00 p.m., all the Chinese workers in the Pudong Xiangsheng Factory and the Yangjing Hefeng Machinery Factory resumed work.</p>
<h3>Soldiers of the 19th Route Army Detained and Humiliated by the Japanese Army</h3>
<p>Deceived After Buying Tickets Barehanded</p>
<p>Beaten and Detained</p>
<p>Liang Guangxin, a first-class soldier of the Special Service Battalion of the 78th Division of the 19th Route Army, and Fang Da, a second-class soldier of the Second Company of the Third Regiment of the 155th Brigade, took a bus to the Osaka Pier at 4:30 p.m. the day before yesterday to buy boat tickets, preparing to go to Fujian. Unexpectedly, they were beaten and detained by the Japanese marines stationed at the pier. It is reported that after hearing the news, the municipal government sent personnel to investigate the details yesterday, preparing to lodge a serious protest.</p>
<h3>Workers of the China Industrial Factory Petitioned Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Social Bureau Will Hold the Third Mediation This Afternoon Since the labor-management dispute occurred in the China Industrial Factory on Bailinan Road in this city, the party and government authorities have mediated twice, but the results have not been achieved because the opinions of both parties are too far apart. Yesterday morning, they gathered the workers of the silk and satin receiving and dispatching departments to petition the Municipal Government and the Social Bureau, and convened a meeting in the evening. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Reasons for Petition The workers of the factory originally planned that the factory should issue three months' salary calculated at 12 hours of work per day, about 150 yuan, to each person when handling the dismissal procedures. After party and government mediation, it was stipulated that each person should be issued one month's salary calculated at 8 hours of work per day, about 50 yuan. Before the dismissal procedures are handled, the factory should provide food expenses of 3 corners per person, but the factory has always been unable to bear it and has delayed in fulfilling it. Therefore, on the afternoon of the 19th, the City Party Department and the Social and Public Security Bureaus sent personnel to the factory to summon the chairman of the board, Xie Peide, to persuade him to issue food expenses, but Xie still refused to accept it. The workers believed that the factory had no sincerity in solving the problem. In addition to submitting a document to the municipal government requesting a solution, they went to the municipal government at 10:00 yesterday morning to request relief.</p>
<p>Petition Situation At 10:00 yesterday morning, more than 300 workers from the silk and satin receiving and dispatching departments of the China Industrial Factory gathered in front of the Municipal Government at Fenglin Bridge, and sent representatives Wang Songsheng and Chen Binghui to petition the Municipal Government. Zhang Shiwu, a staff member of the Municipal Government, met with them. After Zhang's staff member explained to the representatives that the submitted documents had been ordered to be handled by the Social Bureau, the representatives went to the Social Bureau to ask for instructions. Wang Xianqing, the director of the mediation section of the bureau, met them. Wang told the representatives that due to procedural reasons, the labor and management parties must be summoned for the second mediation tomorrow (that is, today) afternoon. The representatives informed the workers that all the workers were still waiting for a reply at the Municipal Government, so they returned to report to the workers. The workers believed that this matter should be resolved urgently and should ask the Municipal Government to express concrete measures again. The Municipal Government sent Wang Shaoqi to the grass in front of the Municipal Government to explain in detail to all the workers and expressed their willingness to consider it. All the workers were satisfied and dispersed. It is also learned that the workers of the factory convened a meeting again at 9:00 last night to discuss the election of representatives to go to the Social Bureau to participate in the mediation tomorrow (that is, today), and the attitude that the workers should hold during the mediation.</p>
<h3>Jin Wensi Will Go to Peiping Tomorrow</h3>
<p>To Assist Gu Weijun in Completing the League of Nations Investigation Team's Report</p>
<p>Said That the Rehe Incident Was a Pre-arranged Plan by the Japanese</p>
<p>Jin Wensi, the representative of the Chinese delegation to the League of Nations Investigation Team, came to Shanghai for recuperation after returning from the Northeast with Gu Weijun last time. Now that the League of Nations Investigation Team, including Lytton and others, has arrived in China from Japan, our country urgently needs to finish all the reporting documents as soon as possible. Therefore, Gu Weijun urgently telegraphed from Peiping a few days ago, urging Jin to go north to help him complete this work. After receiving the telegram, Jin purchased boat tickets from the Taikoo Company yesterday and is scheduled to depart for Peiping on the Shuntian tomorrow. His wife will also accompany him. It is heard that Jin's return to Shanghai will be after the Investigation Team leaves the country. Yesterday, Jin talked about the Rehe Incident with a reporter from the Far East News Agency who visited him. According to Jin, the violent Japan's plan to invade Rehe, when we were in the Northeast, we heard this atmosphere. Therefore, the so-called Ishimoto Incident is just a pre-arranged arrangement to make an excuse to cover the eyes and ears of the world. However, Rehe is the barrier of Peiping and Tianjin. If Rehe is lost, North China will be in danger. The Japanese will take an inch and advance a foot, and it will be easy to take our entire country as if taking something out of a pocket. The future danger is difficult to imagine. As for what attitude the Investigation Team will take on this, because the report has not yet been obtained, it is not convenient to speculate. The previous rumor that the Investigation Team advocated convening an international conference to solve the Sino-Japanese problem is not accurate. I (Jin called himself) believe that from now on, the Chinese people must not rely on others without seeking their own salvation. I have heard that the Peiping and Tianjin authorities and the Rehe provincial authorities are prepared, and I think they will not repeat the same mistakes. I also hope that the public will pay attention quickly and be the backing of the government with strength.</p>

<h3>Counter-Revolutionary Case Was Sent to the Garrison Headquarters Yesterday</h3>
<p>Eighty-Eight People Were Taken Away in Three Trucks</p>
<p>Ninety-three men and women who were meeting at the Republican Grand Theater on Robert Shen Road in West Shanghai on the 17th of this month were arrested by the City Public Security Bureau and sent to the Third Section for preliminary trial the day before yesterday. Among them, there were nine students from China Public School. Cai Zimin, the chairman of the school's board of directors, sent a letter to the Director of the Public Security Bureau, Wen Yinxing, asking whether the arrested students were suspected of being counter-revolutionary and whether they could be released on bail. Director Wen said that the case was of great importance and he had no right to deal with it. In addition to releasing Zheng Fuzhen, the owner of the Republican Grand Theater, and five other teahouse staff members of the theater on bail, the remaining eighty-eight people were escorted by the bureau with documents and loaded into three trucks together to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters yesterday (July 21) afternoon to be tried according to law.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai-Peiping Seaplane Route That Is Being Actively Prepared</h3>
<p>Can Be Realized Approximately Within the Year</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications is actively preparing for the Shanghai-Peiping seaplane route in response to the needs of the people. It has ordered China Aviation Corporation to be responsible for the preparation. According to a gentleman from the company yesterday, the Ministry of Communications, in view of the fact that the Jinpu Railway and sea voyages take a lot of time, specially prepared the Shanghai-Peiping seaplane route to facilitate travel. The route is temporarily scheduled to reach Shanghai via Qingdao and Haizhou. The route is about 1,800 miles long and is being actively carried out. As for the date of the test flight, it has not yet been determined and can be realized approximately within the year.</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Telegram to the Ministry of Railways Requesting Reduction in Shanxi Coal Freight Rates</h3>
<p>Otherwise, National Coal Will Never Recover</p>
<p>Yesterday, the City Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Railways, requesting a reduction in Shanxi coal freight rates to avoid triggering incidents and to benefit the sales of national coal. The original text reads: "To the esteemed Ministry of Railways in Nanjing, on the 2nd of this month, we received a joint letter from the Shanxi Datong Jinbei Mining Bureau and the Shanxi Datong Coal Industry Company's Baojin Branch, stating that Shanxi coal reserves are abundant, and the coal quality is excellent. After being transported and sold overseas, as well as to major commercial ports, factories, and ships in Shanghai, Hankou, Fujian, and Hong Kong, it has been highly praised as the best fuel. Unfortunately, due to its inland location, it is 600 kilometers away from the nearest seaport. The PingSui Railway Bureau disregards the fundamental principle of state-owned railways and has not paid attention to encouraging domestic coal production or supporting export trade, only focusing on increasing its own revenue. This has resulted in extremely high freight rates for Shanxi coal, presenting a unique situation nationwide. In 1930, the special price for Shanxi coal transportation issued by the Ministry, 7.32 cents per ton per kilometer, could only be used for sales, and there was no significant profit for the coal industry. However, in the spring of 1931, even this was canceled by the Ministry. Currently, the freight cost for each ton of coal transported from Kouquan to Fengtai, a distance of 400 kilometers, is almost six yuan. Although the BeiNing Railway Bureau has slightly reduced the cost for transshipment in Tanggu, it still requires an additional 1.70 yuan. Therefore, the export freight cost for coal from northern Shanxi is approximately 7.70 yuan per ton, not including other miscellaneous expenses. Enemy coal, such as Fushun coal in Tianjin and Qinzhou coal in Shanghai, sells for only eight or nine yuan. Even if coal were given away for free, it would not be competitive. As a result, the export of Shanxi coal has been declining, and the livelihoods of the people of Shanxi have been greatly affected. Since the Shanghai Incident, the market has become even more sluggish, and sales at a loss are difficult. Japanese coal takes advantage of the situation, relying on national regulation, strong capital, and rapid transportation to exert pressure. Therefore, the future of Shanxi coal seems bleak unless the freight rates of the PingSui Railway are thoroughly reduced. Recently, we heard that the JiaoJi Railway, in order to rescue Shandong's national coal, has agreed to reduce freight rates and allow each mine to report the amount of coal to be transported to the seaport first, and then collect the freight after the coal is sold. This is indeed an effective way to resist Japanese coal and save national coal. The urgent need for assistance for Shanxi coal has previously been graciously supported by your association, which has appealed to all parties on our behalf. Now, it is even more urgent. We earnestly request that you consider the national difficulties, cultivate the national foundation, and forward this to the Ministry, ordering the PingSui and BeiNing Railways to substantially reduce the freight rates for Shanxi coal to compete with enemy coal, thereby preventing losses and allowing the JiaoJi method to be adopted to benefit businesses. We are filled with anticipation."</p>
<p>"Upon investigation, the freight rates for Shanxi coal were increased in May of last year, increasing costs and making sales difficult. We have repeatedly requested through affiliated associations to continue handling matters according to the old rules, but our requests have not been approved. Now, since the Shanghai Incident has been quelled, coal from Fushun and Kyushu has gathered like clouds and flocks, all aiming to dump their products in our city market. National coal, due to excessive costs, finds it difficult to compete, and sales have plummeted, leading to the closure of various mines in Zibo. Currently, the railway authorities have agreed to reduce freight rates by 40% at the request of mine owners to provide relief. Shanxi Province has abundant coal production, but sales are often hampered by exorbitant freight rates. At this time of national crisis, foreign coal continues to invade. If the freight rates for national coal are not reduced to allow it to expand sales, the Zibo mine closures will serve as a warning, and Shanxi Province may also face the same fate, causing the domestic coal industry to never recover. Based on the information in the letter above, it is appropriate to telegraph your Ministry for review and approval, and to approve the substantial reduction of freight rates for Shanxi coal on the PingSui and BeiNing Railways to prevent losses, stabilize people's livelihood, and await orders with utmost urgency." Signed, Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<h3>Salt Tax in the Five Districts of Jiangsu</h3>
<p>Salt is an essential commodity for daily life. According to old statistics, each person consumes three qian per day, or seven jin per year (this saying originates from Guanzi, although the measurement units of ancient and modern times are different, it can still be used as an approximate figure). Regardless of gender, age, or social class, the consumption is almost equal. Since the Spring and Autumn Period, when Qi had the saying of "official mountains and seas," and the Han Dynasty had Huan Kuan's "Discourse on Salt and Iron," salt has occupied an important part of China's national annual budget. Throughout the dynasties, there have been reforms, but the principle of taxation has always been followed. Only the amount of tax and the methods of collection have changed with the times. However, as customs have developed, although the salt monopoly belongs to the state, its management relies on merchants. Moreover, the categories within it are extremely detailed and have their own system, so it is generally not something that people are willing to study. Even if there is an increase in taxes, it is indirectly paid by merchants and directly paid by salt consumers, and it is distributed at an average rate. The increase per jin is limited, and salt consumers rarely store large quantities, so they still do not pay much attention. They do not know that the salt tax has a significant relationship with the national treasury, and the daily necessities of individuals have a vital interest in it. This is why the increase in salt tax in areas such as Lianghuai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Changlu, which is being implemented soon, and especially the tax rate in the five districts of Jiangsu, is of great importance to salt consumers in Jiangnan and Shanghai. Therefore, we have conducted a preliminary investigation and consulted salt administration experts, revealing the details one by one so that salt consumers can understand them.</p>
<p>People often think of salt as a private profession. This statement seems true but is not. The importance of salt for daily use is the same as that of tea, rice, silk, and cloth. Why are other items that are also taxed not considered professions, but salt is? The intention of national legislation is that the need for salt is even greater than that for rice, silk, and tea. It is not only needed for seasoning food but also for health and nutrition. Because its benefits are more widespread, it must be treated with more caution. Moreover, the amount of tax is very large, which has a great impact on the national economy. Therefore, it must be listed as a national undertaking. In today's academic terms, it may be the beginning of national capitalism.</p>
<p>Although the salt monopoly belongs to the state, it is difficult for the state to manage it on its own. Moreover, the sale of salt is a commercial activity. Even if it is operated by the state as a government-run enterprise, it may not be effective. Therefore, as customs have developed, the state has entrusted the business to merchants, strictly enforcing the Salt Inspectorate and establishing separate salt administration offices to distinguish them from administrative offices. Their attention to salt affairs can be described as complete.</p>
<p>Salt is an essential commodity for human life. Whether in urban or rural areas, it must be properly distributed to avoid bland food. However, merchants take on the business with the premise of making profits. However, there are only a few areas in the country that produce salt. It is not like tea, rice, or cloth, which can be obtained anywhere. Therefore, if there are no restrictions and responsibilities, merchants will only gather in cities to seek profits. In remote rural areas, the population is small, and transportation is difficult, so who would be willing to deliver it? Therefore, the state must designate a certain number of people, strictly guarantee them, supervise their sales, determine their business area, and limit their business volume so that profits and losses can be mutually compensated (i.e., a province has urban and rural areas, and merchants must take care of everything. Cities can earn profits, while remote areas may have some losses to adjust), and sales can be universal. These people, restricted by the law, have no possibility of shirking their responsibilities. Based on the principle of equal rights and obligations, since responsibilities cannot be avoided, profits are also their reward. This is the origin of the so-called "special merchant" in later generations.</p>
<p>China is a large country, but only coastal areas are abundant in salt production. Inland areas such as Sichuan, Gansu, Shanxi, Henan, and Hubei also have some production, but it is not enough to meet the demand. Even in these coastal salt-producing areas, due to the different components of the brine, the cost varies. If the state allows free sales, those with lower costs will inevitably take advantage, and no one will care about those with higher costs. In this way, not only will those with lower costs not be enough to supply the entire country, but also the workers who rely on salt production in areas with higher costs will face unemployment. Therefore, in order to regulate supply and demand, the state has also delineated salt sales areas, so that products from certain places are sold in certain places, so as to avoid merchants choosing cheap prices and causing disputes. This is the origin of the "permit system."</p>
<p>Salt is an important commodity in the country, and taxes are levied on it. Moreover, the tax amount is often higher than the cost, so those who smuggle and sell privately can obtain multiple times the profit. As a result, the number of smugglers is increasing day by day. The government is strictly cracking down on smuggling as a temporary measure to prevent the transportation and sale of untaxed salt. However, those who are greedy for profit may not be afraid of the law, so it is not enough to simply crack down on smuggling. Therefore, as a fundamental solution, the taxes must also be graded. For example, in areas near salt production and areas where smuggled salt is easy to reach, the taxes are particularly low, so that smuggled salt is difficult to obtain high profits, and smugglers may be able to hide. In remote areas, customs checkpoints are heavy, and patrols are easy to be strict, so the taxes are heavier to increase national taxes. However, salt is a necessity of life, and each person consumes only seven or eight jin per year, so even if the taxes are harsh, the burden is limited. This is the ultimate intention of national legislation, to collect from the people universally, gather small amounts to make a large amount, and it is not the beginning of a fiscal path.</p>
<p>Due to the sale of salt, there are regions; due to the prevention of smuggling, taxes are different. However, in neighboring areas, light taxes and heavy taxes are divided by a mountain or a river, and dumping to neighboring private individuals is inevitable. Therefore, the level of salt tax is also balanced in the neighboring areas where salt is sold. The largest production in the country is Huai salt, and the sales area is also the widest, covering the four provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi, called the four banks. The tax rate is also the highest, so there are more private individuals near the four banks. The current tax increase does not include the four banks, probably because of this. The sales in the five districts of Jiangsu cover almost all of Jiangnan, but because the distance from the salt-producing area is different, and the degree of private invasion varies, the tax rates are also divided into several grades.</p>
<p>(1) Hinterland (i.e., areas where private sales are not easy to reach and are not adjacent to Huai, so the tax rate is relatively high), such as seven places including Su, Xi, Shang, Nan, and Chuan.</p>
<p>(2) Border areas (i.e., areas adjacent to Huai sales, where Huai salt is easy to invade, so the tax rate is slightly lower), such as Changzhou and Zhenjiang.</p>
<p>(3) Special areas (i.e., areas where Huai salt and Zhejiang salt are sold together, so the Huai and Zhejiang taxes are the same), such as Changyinsha.</p>
<p>(4) Reduced areas (i.e., areas where smuggled salt is easy to reach, and special price reductions are made to combat smuggling), such as the reduced areas of Shangnan and Chuan, Baoshan Jieyi Jiejijiu Liangtu, Qidong, and the Shanghai Concession and Pudong. However, the tax rates in the reduced areas still have some grades.</p>
<p>As for the tax rate quota, the hinterland was initially two yuan and five jiao for the regular tax per dan, and seven jiao for the patrol fee (the patrol was originally run by merchants, but when the Audit Office was established, it was incorporated into the administration, so seven jiao were added, and the patrol was run by the Audit Office), which is the so-called three yuan and two jiao area. However, after the 16th year of the Republic of China, two yuan and five jiao were levied for military expenses, one yuan for local reorganization and post-war expenses, one jiao for education and charity expenses, and recently, three jiao were added for the pound loss. Therefore, the actual total regular and additional tax paid per dan is seven yuan and one jiao. From the perspective of the salt administration, local reorganization, education, and charitable undertakings are not included in the national tax, so the tax increase form of the Ministry of Finance lists it as six yuan. This is the highest tax rate in the five districts of Jiangsu, so it has not been increased this time.</p>
<p>The regular tax in the border area is five jiao less than that in the hinterland, totaling two yuan per dan, plus a patrol fee of seven jiao, which is two yuan and seven jiao, which is the so-called two yuan and seven jiao area in the current tax increase form. The remaining burdens are the same as those in the hinterland, and the actual regular and additional taxes paid are six yuan and six jiao per dan. This time, the tax increase is one jiao per dan.</p>
<p>Reduced land was originally a tax-free area in the Qing Dynasty. At the end of the Guangxu reign, a light tax was levied, called the reduced land regular tax. It was initially one yuan per dan, then five jiao were added. Other additional taxes and patrols were all halved. However, Changyinsha has a heavier tax than the reduced land and a lighter tax than the hinterland because of the joint sale of Huai and Zhejiang. Even with the reduced land, Qidong is the lightest, and Shangnan Chuan Baoshan Jieyi Jiejijiu Liangtu is slightly lighter than the Shanghai Concession and Pudong. The difference in height is not much, and the determination of the tax rate is completely based on combating smuggling. This time, Changjinsha increased by one yuan and four jiao and five fen, Qidong increased by one yuan, Shangnan Chuan Baoshan Jieyi Jiejijiu Liangtu increased by one yuan and three jiao, and the Shanghai Concession and Pudong increased by one yuan and four jiao and five fen, and one yuan and two jiao and five fen, respectively.</p>
<p>Overall, the salt sales area in the five districts of Jiangsu, in addition to local surcharges, used to be six yuan per dan at the highest and one yuan and nine jiao at the lowest. After the tax increase, the highest is still six yuan, and the lowest is two yuan and nine jiao. The concession has increased from three yuan and five fen and three yuan and two jiao and five fen to four yuan and two jiao and four yuan and five jiao, respectively. The difference is slightly less than before, which is also the initial step of the uniform tax method.</p>
<p>Since salt cannot be without tax, and tax cannot be without different rates, if we want to reorganize and use the principle of uniform tax, it may be a good method in the transition. However, there is a saying in salt administration, "high price attracts private individuals," and "tax reduction hides private individuals." The current uniform tax is not to reduce the tax on heavy tax salt, but to increase the tax on light tax salt. Therefore, it is necessary to take both the symptoms and root causes into account, and while having high prices, we should also urgently seek methods to combat private individuals, which may be helpful.</p>
<p>Nothing is better than patrolling to combat private individuals. The patrol is now managed by the Audit Office, called the tax police. It is rumored that this reorganization of salt administration will increase salt tax on one hand and reduce expenses on the other, with the savings expected to reach one-third. However, if the tax police are also reduced by one-third, their strength will inevitably be weakened, and private sales will inevitably become more prosperous due to the high price of salt and the possibility of making more profits. As a result, although the salt tax is high and the salt price is expensive, with the competition of private transport, it is feared that the total amount obtained may not be increased, and the national treasury may not be able to increase its income. Therefore, tax increases should be actively carried out at the same time as cracking down on smuggling to achieve results. The principle is clear, and we sincerely hope that those who care about salt administration will pay attention to it so as not to waste this move.</p>

<h3>Alarming Moral Decay: A Strange Play Involving Humans and Dogs</h3>
<p>Secret Performances in Hotels</p>
<p>Only Six Yuan per Show</p>
<p>Chen Xinzai Deserves to be Killed for Profit</p>
<p>Four Ignorant Girls are Pitiable</p>
<p>In recent years, the moral decay and loss of shame in Shanghai have become increasingly serious. Rape and seduction occur every day, but it can still be said to be interaction between people. Unexpectedly, now it is getting worse, and a strange play involving bestiality has occurred. The performers are girls whose milk teeth have not yet fallen out. Therefore, this kind of incident not only harms morality but also harms humanity. Therefore, the secrets are summarized as follows, and we hope that the local authorities will take immediate action to ban it.</p>
<p>Since the tide of sexual desire has swept the sea, the hotels in the concessions have become training grounds for studying sexual intercourse. Whether it is actual sexual intercourse, sexual intercourse on the screen, or various other sexual intercourse that people have not seen, only hotels can see the whole picture. Recently, someone has trained mature male husband and girl sexual postures. At dusk, they take dogs and children to major hotels. Those who want to watch their skills are charged six yuan per night. In general, curious people and shameless people are willing to spend a lot of money to watch this secret play. Those who engage in this illegal business have tripled their profits. As a result, there are more and more imitators. Chen Xinzai, a performer who was once famous throughout Shanghai for ringing the bell twice a day at the Sanyun Building Amusement Park of Yong'an Company, is now also engaged in this side business. Chen is from Henan and is 45 years old. He lives at No. 12 Hongfu Road, Xin Zha Road. His wife, Ms. Lu, is the same age as him. They also have four daughters, Shuanglin, who is 11 years old, Guilin, who is 8 years old, the third daughter, Genlin, and the young Caiyun, who are all only 5 years old. In addition, there is Liu Xinsan, a Tianjin native who sings duets and drums. Chen left him living in his home. During the day, he taught the daughters to learn opera. At night, Chen and his wife put the four daughters in a room, let them sleep on the same bed, and then put a very tame black male dog on the bed to practice sexual intercourse with the daughters. Over time, the relationship between the girls and the dog became closer and closer. Chen and others believed that they were well-trained</p>
<h3>Wu Jingxiong and Ma Yinchu Discuss the Abolition of Taels and Adoption of Yuan</h3>
<p>Since [the incident at] Zaju [Bridge], the call for abolishing taels and adopting yuan has been very loud, and many insightful arguments have been published in newspapers. On this principle, most voices are in agreement, expressing their support. However, some are concerned about whether the methods are appropriate and whether the timing is right, requesting careful consideration. They agree in principle with the abolition of taels and adoption of yuan, but considering the complexity of national political issues and the decline of the social economy, there is value in research and room for consideration. If implemented rashly, the consequences would be unimaginable. Moreover, the idea of abolishing taels and adopting yuan has been advocated for over a decade, with suggestions from the financial sector and promotion by renowned scholars, yet it has not been realized. The crux of the matter is self-evident. Jingxiong once published an article in the supplementary section of Shen Bao on the 19th of this month, discussing it in detail, consistently believing that this issue should be discussed carefully and considered meticulously. Recently, Dr. Ma Yinchu's article was published. We thought that the words of an economic giant like Dr. Ma would enlighten the public and greatly help the future of abolishing taels and adopting yuan. However, after reading the entire article, he ignored the methods and timing, only criticizing money shops for disregarding the overall situation. Therefore, I venture to express my doubts and present my views, hoping that Dr. Ma can correct me. Dr. Ma said, "The motivation for adopting yuan is a coincidence. On the one hand, it is due to the great chaos in the currency system in the past, and on the other hand, it is due to the sharp fall in foreign silver taels," and also said, "Since foreign silver taels have repeatedly fallen, those who hold silver dollars with higher silver content might as well melt them into silver," and also said, "Now, melting away some of the silver dollars with mixed colors can gradually lead to consistency." In summary, his main idea is that the depreciation of foreign silver taels and the melting of good coins are good opportunities for abolishing taels and adopting yuan. This is actually close to the thinking of market speculation. The reason for the fall in the price of silver taels is that the actual value of silver coins is too different from their face value. Since the opening of trade, almost all daily necessities in the country have depended on foreign countries, and all goods are priced in silver taels. Recently, due to the stagnation of urban finance and the exhaustion of the inland economy, all industries have used various methods to promote paper money in various places, repeatedly concentrating it in Shanghai, either to repay debts or to purchase goods. It is inevitable to exchange yuan for taels. As a result of the low silver content of hard currency and the proliferation of soft currency, the phenomenon of the sharp fall in the price of silver taels has developed today. Therefore, the step of adopting yuan should naturally take the unification of hard and soft currency as a prerequisite. We must first set up hard currency with good silver content, and then seek to centralize the issuance of soft currency and enrich its reserves. Only then can we talk about adopting yuan, so that prices will not rise sharply due to the proliferation of paper money and inferior coins, and the social economy and the livelihood of ordinary people will not be seriously affected by the sharp rise in prices. Moreover, Dr. Ma has already admitted in his article that the coins melted recently are those with higher silver content, and the coins left are those with low silver content. Then, can these remaining inferior coins be enough to take on the responsibility of replacing the silver tael standard? If it is as he said, then Shanghai and the whole country will not become a base for inferior coins? This kind of speculative method of adopting yuan, is it what the wise government wants to adopt, and what renowned economists consider reasonable? This is the first point that should be asked for guidance. Dr. Ma's deduction of the reasons for the sharp fall in foreign silver taels is nothing more than (1) the decline of the rural economy, (2) the concentration of urban funds, (3) the failure of financial committees, (4) the decline of urban industry and commerce, (5) the huge amount of cash storage, (6) the frequent occurrence of banditry in the interior, but he ignores the fact that the actual value of the current large amount of new coins is only 68.5%, which puts the cart before the horse. We must know that the above six reasons are all caused by political factors. If politics is on the right track and finance is well managed, then the above six reasons can all be eliminated, and the currency system can be unified. Abolishing taels and adopting yuan is only a part of the currency system problem. When the time comes, the people will automatically implement it without waiting for the government's supervision. Now Dr. Ma is putting the cart before the horse, does he think that after the abolition of taels and the adoption of yuan is successful, the above six reasons can all be solved easily? This is the second point that should be asked for guidance from Dr. Ma.</p>
<p>The silver taels in various places are of mixed quality and vary from place to place, which is indeed an obstacle to the unification of the currency system. But what we know is that the paper money issued by various banks is also limited to the region and cannot circulate throughout the country. For example, paper money in Shanghai cannot be taken to Hankou for exchange, and paper money in Tianjin cannot be taken to Guangzhou for use. The territories are divided like Qin and Yue. Moreover, in remote provinces, the excessive issuance of Jin banknotes, Yue banknotes, Dian banknotes, and Feng banknotes is out of control everywhere. These are all obstacles to the unification of the currency system, no less than silver taels. The issuance system should be rectified first. This is obvious. If this is not done first, and we start abolishing taels and adopting yuan, can the above obstacles be swept away after the yuan is adopted? Dr. Ma said, "Who can make a judgment on what comes first and what comes later?" Is this any different from only asking the architect to build a house, without asking him to make plans to solidify the foundation first? This is the third point that should be asked for guidance.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of minting silver coins, because the government has no intention of making profits, but in the current political environment, can it make the provinces abide by the rules? No one can make a judgment on this. Even if the Shanghai factory has the supervision of the business community, it can not be affected by the political forces of the capital, but how about the fact that there are still many minting machines in various provinces? Moreover, terms such as supervision, independence, and openness have long become tools for deceiving people. Otherwise, with the strict regulations of the "25 Fund Management Committee Regulations," why is it that the national debt fund still has changes? This is the fourth point that should be asked for guidance.</p>
<p>Also, Dr. Ma always focuses on money shops whenever he discusses the abolition of taels and adoption of yuan, almost regarding money shops as the only sinners who hinder this move. This time, he also put forward the following three facts, believing that the reason for money shops' opposition is (1) a profit of 1.25%, (2) interbank deposits, (3) the establishment of a bank clearing house. However, we have examined the opinions expressed by the gentlemen of the money industry and have not seen any opposition to the adoption of yuan. We only see their request to first unify the minting power, rectify the issuance system, take back the judgment power, restrict foreign banks from absorbing deposits and issuing paper money, and take the Ping-Han Railway as a warning, and worry about the impact of price changes on the livelihood of ordinary people. Their views are also very far-reaching. Under the current political situation, it seems that we cannot view them with disdain. The past history of issuing banks has indeed left room for criticism. The future situation still depends on the government's supervision ability. If we say that we will learn from the past and will not repeat the same mistakes, then the suspension of cash payment has been seen many times. If we say that the current implementation system will have no other worries, then before the Ping-Han Railway suspended cash payment, it also called for full preparation. Therefore, whether the current regulation of the 46 preparation system is reasonable (after checking, the 46 system for issuing preparation is well known to everyone, but Dr. Ma's original text said that the current issuance preparation is 70% cash and 30% guarantee, I don't know what the basis is), whether the 60% cash is real, whether the public inspection method is appropriate, and how to make the market immediately have hard currency of considerable silver content that can be used after the hasty abolition of taels and adoption of yuan, how to make those who issue paper money enrich their reserves, and how to protect the increasingly consolidated 40% of the bonds that have been reorganized as a guarantee preparation. All of these should be discussed in depth before the abolition of taels and adoption of yuan, and it is not appropriate to blame the money industry for being overly cautious. Then, let's discuss the three reasons put forward by Dr. Ma. The first item of 1.25% has been declared by people in the money industry as talk that outsiders do not understand the truth, and is not worth mentioning, so there is no need to repeat it. The second item of interbank deposit problem actually has nothing to do with the interests of the money industry. The interbank deposit is originally prepared for the bank to withdraw at any time. The temporary nature of the deposit time is even more than ordinary current deposits. Moreover, not every money industry accepts this kind of deposit. Most of those who absolutely do not accept this kind of deposit still account for the majority. Moreover, whether to deposit and accept depends entirely on the agreement between the bank and the money industry. The bank is unwilling to deposit, and the money industry cannot force it. The money industry is unwilling to accept, and can the bank deposit it? If the bank voluntarily deposits in the money industry, even after the adoption of yuan, why can't it be handled? Moreover, after checking the current deposit, the amount of silver dollars accounts for a huge amount, which shows that the deposit is not limited to silver taels. As for the saying that money industry has silver accounts but no foreign accounts, it is even more unfounded based on the above situation. The money industry has a history of hundreds of years, and the development of the banking industry began in the Republic of China. If it is said that the money industry must rely on bank deposits to survive, how did the money industry survive before there were banks? This is known to those who know, and there is no need to waste words. As for the third item referring to the clearing house, the money industry has no reason to object to it. The clearing house should be organized by the Shanghai Chinese and foreign financial, silver, and money industries. If there is a good method, it does not need to be realized after the abolition of taels and adoption of yuan. It can be organized before the abolition of taels. The reason why it has not been established for a long time is still due to the different internal organizations of the banking industry. For example, for a holiday, Bank A stops for three days, Bank B for two days, Bank C for one day, and Industrial Bank is open as usual. The Huanghuang advertisement is often seen in the newspaper. From this point alone, we can imagine that if the banking industry can be unified and the clearing house can be organized and established, then the money industry can also join. Based on the above three facts, none of them are related to the abolition of taels and adoption of yuan. The money industry will never express its opposition because of this. Does Dr. Ma have other intentions, so he made this statement to deceive the public? This is the fifth point that should be asked for guidance.</p>
<p>Also, Dr. Ma said, "The money industry believes that once silver taels are abolished, the chips will feel lack, which is a reason for opposition, which is completely unconscious," and used the analogy of combining two bowls of water into one, and the amount remains unchanged from beginning to end. After checking, the money industry has not opposed the abolition of taels and adoption of yuan, as mentioned above. Those who worry about the lack of chips are afraid that the hard chips are insufficient and will be replaced by unfulfilled soft chips, causing the economic organization to collapse. As long as it is guaranteed that the hard chips have solid silver content and the soft chips have sufficient reserves, their doubts will be dispelled. Considering that when two bowls of water are combined into one, although the amount may be equal, the quality of the water may be different. Without prior chemical testing, how can they be rashly combined, causing the drinker to feel uncomfortable? With Dr. Ma's intelligence, how can he not see this? This is the sixth point that should be asked for guidance.</p>
<p>In short, the abolition of silver taels has almost become a natural law. Not only that, but the reform of the current silver coins, silver dimes, and copper coins has also been recognized as an urgent task. However, reform must have a thorough method, and it cannot be done hastily or piecemeal. If there is a thorough method, it can be implemented at any time, and there is no need to ask whether the price of silver taels is falling or not.</p>
<p>Dr. Ma's knowledge and articles are admired by all. Every word and every move is a model for the people of the country. Therefore, we sincerely hope that Dr. Ma will conduct further research on this issue, have a further understanding of the content of silver and money, and conduct a more detailed investigation of the political environment, social situation, and the livelihood of ordinary people. Only then can we combine theory with practice and take both sides into consideration. Then, when he publishes articles, it will greatly help the improvement of the national economic organization, which is far better than finding a way out for some people. Jingxiong studied law and has little knowledge of economic principles. However, based on academic theory and factual aspects, there are things that must be said. Therefore, before it is implemented, I dare to spare no words to discuss in detail for the research of the society, hoping to get good results. What does Dr. Ma think?</p>
<h3>The Chinese Ratepayers' Association Sends a Letter to the Public Works Bureau Requesting Attention to Fire Prevention Equipment</h3>
<p>The Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession sent a letter to the Director of the Public Works Bureau yesterday, saying, "Dear Sir, we have received a letter from the United Business Association of North Fujian Road, Shanghai, saying that the members near the north end of the Old Zhabei Bridge, in view of the carelessness of the Tongtai Chang Tobacco Paper Shop after 12:00 pm on July 11, the fire truck arrived relatively late, resulting in the burning of two neighboring houses. They are suddenly alarmed by the fire and want to seek a proper way to install equipment. They plan to ask our association to request the fire department to install a warning light directly connected to the fire station at the bridgehead for emergency needs and to ensure the safety of residents. Based on this, we found that North Fujian Road is narrow and the city houses are densely packed. In this hot weather, extra attention should be paid to fire prevention equipment. We hereby send a letter to your bureau, requesting the Public Works Bureau's fire department to approve its request to ensure the safety of citizens, etc. We have approved this. After checking, the association's statement is indeed beneficial to the public. We should send a letter to your bureau to handle it and pay attention to fire prevention."</p>
<h3>The All-Zhejiang Association Advocates Thrift and Seeks Members</h3>
<p>The Shanghai All-Zhejiang Association is organized by Zhejiang people living outside the province and in the province, with the main purpose of seeking the welfare of fellow villagers and connecting hometown friendships. It has been established for more than ten years and has organized many beneficial hometown undertakings. For example, in the All-Zhejiang drought in 1929, the association organized the All-Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association, raised huge funds, and provided relief to the entire province. Now, the association believes that social extravagance has reached its extreme, and the economy of rural and urban areas is gradually collapsing. It especially advocates a thrift movement, such as not giving gifts of more than one yuan, setting a banquet limit of no more than eight yuan per table, and never using foreign goods, etc., to save this decadent trend of extravagance and luxury, and wants to promote frugality among Zhejiang people first. For the sake of practical implementation, it specially seeks members to jointly advocate. The seeking method is divided into two types of organization: special and ordinary. The special team is composed of Lu Jianquan, Qian Xinzhi, Yu Qiaqing, Sheng Ziqiao, Zhuang Songfu, Li Fuxun, Qin Runqing, Zhu Jiejie, Chen Qinshi, Zhang Yongchuan, Chen Jishi, Jin Runquan, Chuan Xiaoan, Zhang Xiaolin, etc., for a total of sixty-six teams. The ordinary team is composed of Chu Minyi, Fang Jiaobo, Gao Zibai, Yao Yongbai, Zhou Peiqian, Wang Fuchuan, Yu Yefeng, Shen Tianxin, Wang Xiangquan, Huang Shenfu, Lou Tongsun, Xiao Jiankang, Xu Dafu, Gu Shuming, etc., for a total of two hundred and fifty-seven teams. The chief captain is Mr. Chu Huiseng, and the deputy chief captain is Yin Zhufu, Wang Xiaolai, etc. The scope of solicitation covers the eleven prefectures of Zhejiang Province and Zhejiang people living outside the province and abroad. The soliciting score is based on 100,000 yuan as the standard. It is heard that the proceeds from this solicitation will be used to build a meeting place. The solicitation period is three months, with one announcement each month. The solicitation started on July 1. All Zhejiang people are requested to join as soon as possible to consolidate unity.</p>
<h3>Request to Postpone the Auction of Huang Chujiu's Leased Land and Building Portion</h3>
<p>Accountants Wu Zheng and Pan Zhaobang, liquidators of the Gongfa Company, jointly submitted a report to the Second Special District Court, stating, "The report is to comply with the order to temporarily dispose of the leased land and building portion under Huang Chujiu's real estate regarding the recent claims of the Riyue Bank and the Quan Shijie Deposit Amusement Department, and to prepare a written opinion, and to apply for postponement of the auction of the leased land and building portion in order to reconvene a meeting of creditor representatives for overall discussion and to protect creditors' rights. The Gongfa Company was organized by Huang Chujiu and others. Later, Huang Chujiu owed a huge amount of about 200,000 yuan, which led to the inability to repay the debts of the depositors of the Riyue Bank and the Quan Shijie Deposit Amusement Department, which are affiliated to the Gongfa Company. The bank closed the day after Huang Chujiu's death. Therefore, the creditors of the Riyue Bank and the Quan Shijie Deposit Amusement Department filed a lawsuit with the former French concession (at that time, the shareholders and instigators of the Gongfa Company all avoided coming forward to handle it. After repeated trials by the former French concession, the reporters were assigned to handle the liquidation matters. Immediately, it was carried out according to law. In addition to pursuing debts from the debtors of the Gongfa Company, and in accordance with the resolution of the creditor representatives, the property was approved by the former French concession to be realized successively to amortize the creditors of the Gongfa Company, with a total of 20%. All the handling process was reported to the former French concession and your court successively on record. Also, the largest of the Gongfa Company's debtors is Huang Chujiu. Therefore, the Gongfa Company's creditors are also Huang Chujiu's creditors. Because Huang Chujiu owed money, if the full amount is recovered, the loss suffered by the Gongfa Company's creditors is only 30%. However, Huang Chujiu's heirs had no cash to repay the debt, so they submitted all the inheritance to the former French concession for disposal. In order to take into account the interests of both creditors and debtors, the former French concession ordered the reporters and Huang Chujiu's family representatives on March 30 to examine what should be sold and what should be kept, and to make proper plans and report to Hou Duo. After the reporters drafted the plan, they first convened a meeting of Gongfa Company creditors to report, and then jointly reported with Huang's representative, Lawyer Tan Yigong. The auction of Huang's real estate was carried out through this procedure. Recently, we received letters from various creditor representatives, putting forward new claims that the real estate part has mortgage relationship. If the price of the auction is not enough to offset the mortgage, who will bear this loss? Also, the item of leased land and building has excellent interest. For the sake of creditors' interests, it is considered better to temporarily retain it. After the creditor representatives and the original liquidators make a proper plan, they will report to your court for accounting, so as to minimize the loss of creditors. The reporters believe that the claim has a great relationship with both creditors and debtors of the Gongfa Company and is worthy of research. However, this kind of discussion cannot show the advantages and disadvantages without first conducting a detailed investigation of the current value of each pledgee of Huang's real estate and making an overall calculation. The investigation is very complicated. Therefore, at the last court session on July 6, the reporters did not fully investigate, and they could not attend the court due to business and illness to make detailed statements. Therefore, they applied for an extension. Although the investigation work is not complete at present, the approximate number can be budgeted. Now we will compile a budget table separately for (1) the simultaneous sale of the leased land and building part and the self-owned real estate, and (2) the retained income of the leased land and building part and the repayment of Gongfa's common debt for comparison. The result is that Huang Chujiu's self-owned real estate and leased land and building part, if realized at one time according to the current method, the balance will not exceed 160,000 yuan in national currency, which is used to amortize the Gongfa debt and is less than 5%. If the self-owned real estate is realized first, and the retained income of the leased land and building part, then during the continued lease period, as long as there are no unexpected changes in the Shanghai market, about 940,000 yuan in national currency can be accumulated to amortize the Gongfa debt, which is about 25%. Together with the previous 20%, it is 45%. If other debts can be recovered, it may be able to make up 50%. The two budgets are very different. For the benefit of creditor law, it seems appropriate to reconvene the creditor representatives to discuss in detail. Otherwise, since there are creditors who claim this, and the difference in the number is so huge, if you are not careful, there will be no regrets. The so-called loss of a millimeter is a thousand miles away. Who can bear this responsibility? Therefore, after learning about its report, they immediately reported it. Now we will restate the situation and reasons in detail, and compile two budget tables for your review. I respectfully request that the auction of the leased land and building part under Huang Chujiu's real estate in Xinghualou area, Wenquan Bath area, and Shengmuyuan Road be temporarily postponed. In the meantime, the reporters will convene a meeting of creditor representatives to discuss in detail in order to protect creditors' rights. This is a virtue. Sincerely report to the Shanghai Second Special District District Court, joint reporters Wu Zheng and Pan Zhaobang, chief accountants of the Gongfa Company Liquidation Assembly.</p>
<h3>Strict Quarantine for All Ships Entering Port</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the President Hoover arrived at the port and the inspection was even stricter</p>
<p>Recently, due to the prevalence of epidemics in Japan and Hong Kong, the Jianghai Customs specially dispatched doctors to board foreign ships for inspection when they entered the port. If there are any symptoms of the epidemic, they will be prohibited from landing to avoid infection. Yesterday, when the President Hoover of the Dollar Steamship Company arrived in Shanghai, the inspection was even stricter and lasted for three hours before it was completed. It is heard that strict inspections will be carried out for all foreign ships entering the port in the future.</p>
<h3>Wusong District Distributes Relief Rice and Clothing</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Red Cross and the Wusong Municipal Office distributed relief rice and clothing at No. 11 Dongsheng Road yesterday. The police of the 7th Public Security District were dispatched to protect the poor households in the four townships who went to receive relief. They were quite crowded. The affected farmers totaled more than 160 villages. More than 300 stones of relief rice were distributed. Each extremely poor household could get 2.5 dou, and at least 1 dou. Each household could receive one piece of clothing. A total of more than 1,100 pieces were distributed. It is heard that the town area will have to wait until next week to distribute it again.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau Announces Exemption of Pig Industry Surtax</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau issued an announcement yesterday for the exemption of the pig industry surtax, saying, "In the case of the pig industry surtax held by the former municipal agency in this city, its name and nature seem to be inconsistent with the current tax system. In order to clarify the source of tax and show consideration for merchants and people, the bureau has presented a directive No. 1876 to the municipal government to exempt it from collection. In addition to ordering the South Shanghai Tax Collection Office to stop collecting this pig industry surtax from this month, it is announced to the public. This is the announcement."</p>
<h3>Dock Workers in This City Request Speedy Implementation of the 28 System</h3>
<p>The central government sent personnel to consult with the party and government authorities in this city</p>
<p>All the docks along the Huangpu River in this city have always been contracted by the contractor, and then the contractor hires workers to load and unload goods for customers. The workers had previously requested the central government to find ways to improve their situation because of the hard work and meager treatment. In 1928, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce issued the "28 System" method, that is, the contractor takes 20% and the workers take 80%. However, the contractor has not implemented this method, while the workers are eagerly looking forward to it. The Central People's Training and Guidance Committee and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce ordered Wang Diwen and Zhang Tiejun to come to Shanghai the other day to investigate the reasons why it could not be implemented in conjunction with the party and government authorities in this city. After Wang and Zhang came to Shanghai, they have contacted the party and government authorities in this city several times. Yesterday, they also convened an informal meeting at the Municipal Party Department. Those who attended the meeting included Wang Manyun, Section Chief of the Municipal Party Department, Chen Kecheng, Secretary of the Municipal Government, Wang Geng, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Wang Diwen, Representative of the Central People's Training Committee, and Zhang Tiejun, Representative of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and several contractor representatives were invited to attend. After all parties exchanged opinions, it was believed that the situation was complex. It was decided that the central representatives would collect the opinions of all parties and report them to the association and the ministry separately, and then discuss and decide.</p>
<h3>Mr. Gaoqiao's Restaurant Business Appeal</h3>
<p>Xu Chunsheng and others request assistance from the fellow villagers association</p>
<p>Every weekend and holiday, many foreigners go to the Gaoqiao Dongtan Beach in Pudong to swim. Therefore, local residents Xu Chunsheng, Fan Xiutang, and others opened two restaurants to provide rest and refreshment for foreigners. Recently, the Public Utilities Bureau ordered them to close and demolish the buildings. It is now heard that Xu and others have requested legal assistance from the fellow villagers association. The text reads: "Presenting this case because the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau abused its power, violated the law, and demolished houses. We earnestly request assistance to maintain our livelihoods. We members have been engaged in commerce in Zhabei, Shanghai. Since the January 28th Shanghai Incident, the goods and property in our shops were destroyed by artillery fire. We were displaced and our livelihoods were precarious. Later, with the assistance of relatives and friends, we built a thatched shed on the Donghai Beach in Gaoqiao, Pudong, and opened a seaside refreshment room to earn a meager profit to support our families. From April to June, during the plum rain season, business was quite bleak. After June, business slightly improved. However, the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, seeing the potential for profit, became covetous and disregarded the livelihoods of the merchants. They used the excuse that our shop was unsanitary, ordered us to close down, and took over the business themselves. Upon investigation, we members use only fine quality items for all our drinks and have never sold any unsanitary food to our customers. Therefore, in the past two months, no customers have developed any illnesses. This proves that we members have not sold any food that endangers health. We do not know what the Public Utilities Bureau based its claims on. It is clearly oppressing merchants and coveting the bureau's own interests. The intention to seize our business is obvious. Moreover, freedom of business is enshrined in the law. We members have registered our restaurant business with the Public Security Bureau and obtained a business license from the Health Bureau. The procedures are complete. How can it be said that we are violating the law? Yet, we have suffered this illegal oppression. How can we accept this? We have already appealed to the Municipal Government, requesting an order to stop this and alleviate the merchants' difficulties. Unexpectedly, before the Municipal Government issued its instructions, the Public Utilities Bureau, on the twelfth of this month, led more than thirty armed police officers and dared to demolish the thatched sheds built by us members and destroy our belongings. This kind of abuse of power and extreme oppression is something that even the autocratic government of the past would not dare to do. Under this clear blue sky, the Public Utilities Bureau, under the jurisdiction of the Municipal Government, has resolutely done it. This is fundamentally contrary to the late Premier's principle of 'Everyone having food to eat' in the People's Livelihood. We members have suffered this cruelty and have no recourse. We have always admired your committee for protecting fellow villagers with meticulous care. Therefore, we venture to implore you to provide strong assistance and request the Municipal Government to stop the Public Utilities Bureau from abusing its power, compensate for damages, and maintain our livelihoods. We are endlessly grateful. Respectfully presented to the Supervisory Committee of the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association. Presenters: Members Xu Chunsheng, Shen Guanliu, Fan Xiuqi, Xin Zhuling."</p>
<h3>Beset by Internal and External Troubles, Qian Weiliang Drowned Himself in the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>His wife was fortunately rescued</p>
<p>A situation deserving of the utmost sympathy</p>
<p>Qian Weiliang, a 20-year-old Catholic from Hsia Shih, Zhejiang, worked as a clerk at the Xian Tai Insurance Company. He lived with his parents at No. 135 Xixinqiao Street, Lingyundao Yuanziziyuan, in the French Concession. In October of last year, he met a singing girl from Jiangyin named Qian Shuying (21 years old) while she was working in a game parlor. They fell in love and he paid to redeem her and married her. Their love was very deep. However, the woman's temperament was very violent. Weiliang's father, Bo Ying (48 years old), and mother were both addicted to opium. His father had recently lost his job and was unemployed. The elderly couple relied on Weiliang to support them. Weiliang only earned 40 yuan a month. After providing his parents with opium and paying the monthly rent of 15 yuan, there was little left. The family of four lived in hardship, leading to frequent quarrels between the young couple. In Shuying's opinion, if her husband did not provide for his in-laws' "black rice" (opium), then the family's "white rice" (plain rice) could be shared among more people. However, Weiliang was by nature weak and kind. He dared not separate from his parents nor did he want to hurt his beloved wife. As a result, he felt the pressure of money externally and was blamed by his beloved wife internally. He was constantly depressed and had nowhere to turn for help. On the 20th, at noon, Weiliang returned home from work for lunch. After another quarrel with his wife over a trivial matter, they both conceived the idea of suicide. At 2:30 PM, the couple went out together, holding hands, and headed to the Bund to drown themselves in the Huangpu River. When they reached the French Company Wharf, Shuying jumped into the river first, followed by Weiliang. When Shuying jumped, she was spotted by a boatman who rushed to save her, and she was fortunate to survive. When Weiliang jumped, the boatman was unable to save him in time, and he drowned. After rescuing Shuying, the boatman called the police and reported the situation. The police took Shuying to the police station. After questioning by the police chief, Shuying was sent home by detectives. Upon hearing the news, the family hired a boat to search for the body without success. They then hired a water ghost to search. At 6:30 PM, the body was finally found and pulled up. The police sent the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch autopsy station. Yesterday morning, the Second Special Court was notified and appointed Prosecutor Wu Xiaoshu to come to the station to examine the body. According to the statement of the deceased's father, Qian Boying, his son had a quarrel with his daughter-in-law, and they went out together. He did not expect them to drown themselves in the river. He now wished to claim the body for burial. Qian Shuying stated that she and her husband agreed to drown themselves in the river. She jumped first and was rescued. She was mentally confused and did not know how her husband jumped or when his body was recovered. She was incoherent during the statement, and her eyes were vacant. Prosecutor Wu verified the statement and declared that Qian Weiliang indeed died by drowning himself in the river. The body was handed over to his father, Qian Boying, to claim for burial.</p>
<h3>Wife Sues for Divorce, Husband Weeps Bitterly in Court</h3>
<p>The judge advised them to understand each other</p>
<p>Instructed lawyers to negotiate a settlement out of court</p>
<p>Guo Limao, from Taizhou County, Zhejiang, graduated from Rowan Textile University in the United States and is currently an engineer at the Shanghai Jinyun Silk Weaving Factory. On January 19, 1930, he married Huang Baoqin (30 years old), the eighth daughter of Huang Jizhi, the owner of the Hua Chun Weaving Factory and chairman of the Asia Commercial Company. Initially, they were harmonious, but recently, a rift developed in their relationship. Huang Baoqin hired lawyer Jiang Yiping to sue the First Special Court for divorce from Guo, and demanded that he be ordered to pay 26,800 yuan in maintenance and other expenses. The main points of her lawsuit were as follows: "The plaintiff married the defendant, but shortly after the marriage, she was often abused. Initially, she tolerated it because they were husband and wife. However, the defendant took advantage of her easiness and became more and more severe. He arbitrarily deducted her monthly maintenance expenses and then, without reason, demanded and forced her to divorce. Whenever she reasoned with him, he would become violent. On May 28th of this year, at 2:00 AM, after a minor quarrel, he drove the plaintiff out of the gate. The area (Huayuanfang, Jin Shenfu Road) is very remote, and the defendant was heartless enough to refuse to let her in, leaving the plaintiff to wander on the road. His malicious abandonment, which caused the plaintiff to suffer unbearable treatment, is extremely obvious. In order to ensure her future safety and mental well-being, the plaintiff has no choice but to sue for divorce. Considering the defendant's financial situation and the plaintiff's status, she requests the court to order him to pay 20,000 yuan in maintenance, 900 yuan to reimburse her for monthly household expenses, 900 yuan for wedding gifts, 2,500 yuan for clothing, 1,500 yuan for furniture, and 1,000 yuan for silverware." Yesterday morning, Judge Yang Peng summoned them to the Ninth Civil Court. Guo Limao hired lawyer Da Yaoxian as his defense attorney. First, Huang Baoqin recounted the events of the night of May 28th, saying, "When I returned home, I turned on the lights, but the defendant forced me to turn them off, which led to a dispute. He then drove me out." She also described various malicious acts by the defendant. Defendant Guo Limao stated, "On the night of May 28th, at 2:00 AM, the plaintiff returned home. I was already asleep. She turned on the lights, and because I had to get up at 5:00 AM to go to work, I asked her to turn off the lights and go to sleep. Unexpectedly, she became angry and left. The next morning, I learned that she had gone to her mother's house. I went to my father-in-law's office to persuade her to return home, but my father-in-law was extremely angry and I had no opportunity to speak. I then wrote a letter to her, but the plaintiff filed a lawsuit. However, I have always treated the plaintiff well. Although she returns home late every night, I do not blame her." While speaking, he wept bitterly. Then, lawyer Da stated, "The defendant's treatment of the plaintiff can be described as loving. The defendant allowed the plaintiff to control all of his private savings in the bank. The defendant's monthly income is only a little over 100 yuan, but his expenses sometimes exceed four times that amount, as the accounts show. Furthermore, the defendant's life insurance policy names the plaintiff as the beneficiary. The defendant originally lived on Hed Road, but moved to Huayuanfang, where seven of the plaintiff's relatives live, because the plaintiff was lonely. He also asked his elderly mother to live elsewhere to avoid family discord. This shows the defendant's feelings for the plaintiff." He then presented the account books and insurance policy as evidence. Lawyer Jiang Yiping then presented witness Xu Zhicheng, saying that he could prove that the defendant had previously proposed a divorce. The court then summoned Xu to the stand. Xu testified, "I am the defendant's teacher and a relative of the plaintiff. At the end of last year, they had a quarrel, and the plaintiff invited me to come over. The defendant used English to express his desire for a divorce. I asked him what the reason was, and he said that she was not well-behaved because she often returned home late at night. I rebuked him for this." Judge Yang then declared to the plaintiff, "Quarrels between husband and wife are common. One cannot resort to extremes over trivial matters. I observe that the defendant is still honest and kind. Although he has made some mistakes, you should both understand and appreciate each other, and remember your past affection. You should be calm and not act impulsively. Therefore, this court believes that a settlement is the best course of action. Both parties should make concessions and reconcile. If the two parties find it inconvenient to negotiate, they can invite relatives and friends to mediate. If a reconciliation is impossible, then this court will handle the case according to the law." He also instructed the lawyers to advise their clients to reconcile. He adjourned the hearing to allow time for reconciliation.</p>
<h3>Abusing a Maidservant, A Charge is Laid</h3>
<p>Zhao Linbao, a young master of a money shop, about 30 years old, became acquainted with a prostitute named Lao Liu (approximately 26 or 27 years old) in the northern part of the city last year, with whom he had an affair. They felt as if they had known each other for a long time, so they rented a house together and took her as a concubine. However, Lao Liu was addicted to opium, lying on the couch day and night. On the 18th of last month, they moved to an upstairs room at No. 5 Sanchengfang, Meibaik Road. A few days later, with the introduction of an old woman, they spent 135 yuan to buy a maidservant named Ying, who was only nine years old, to do chores. They even made her wait on them attentively at night, fetching water and tea, leaving her no time to rest. If she was slightly negligent, Zhao Wenbao would beat her with a laundry stick, leaving her covered in bruises. Fearing that she would cry out loudly for help, they would shove a bamboo ruler down her throat, tie her hands and feet with ropes, and use lit opium sticks to stab her buttocks and thighs. Finally, they would deprive her of food, resorting to the most brutal acts. Lao Liu's brother, unable to bear the sight of this cruelty, secretly took Xiu Ying back to their hometown to be cared for in June. Lao Liu found out about this and brought Xiu Ying back. Because her brother sympathized with Xiu Ying, she hated him even more and abused Xiu Ying day and night, becoming increasingly severe. Later, someone reported this to the police, who sent a doctor to examine the injuries. The police took Lao Liu into custody and filed criminal charges against her with the court, which is scheduled to be heard this morning.</p>
<h3>Five-Year-Old Girl Falls into River and Scalded to Death</h3>
<p>Chen Dafa, a boatman from Gaoyou, moored his boat in front of the Yangshupu Electric Company on the afternoon of the previous day. His five-year-old daughter, Luo Zhengzi, was playing on the stern of the boat when she accidentally fell into the river. The pier there happened to be where the electric company's hot water pump discharged water, so the water in the river was extremely hot. The child essentially fell into a pool of boiling water and was scalded to death instantly. The body only floated up yesterday, with the skin peeling off all over and the abdomen ruptured, a gruesome sight. The water police station sent Detective Hu Changqing to take the body to the South Bund Lifesaving Bureau and report it to the local court for examination. Chen then petitioned the court for exemption from examination.</p>
<h3>French Soldier Shoots Western Police Officer in the Leg</h3>

The people in the bar were unable to resolve the situation and called the police. Western police officer Bial, along with a Chinese police officer, went to the bar. As soon as they entered the bar, the Western police officer was shot in the leg. The two French soldiers were arrested and immediately handed over to the military authorities for trial. Two pistols were seized at the bar at the time. The injured Western police officer is currently at Guangci Hospital (now Ruijin Hospital). His injuries are reportedly not serious, and he will be discharged soon.</p>
<h3>Arsenal Donates Books</h3>
<p>A total of more than 600 types</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Arsenal was ordered to move to Hangzhou, the Shanghai factory has ceased operations and is awaiting reorganization. It is now learned that the arsenal's library has accumulated many books on physics, chemistry, and other subjects. As it is inconvenient to move them to Hangzhou, the arsenal has specially donated these books, totaling more than 600 types, to the library of the First District Party Headquarters. They were delivered yesterday, and the library (located at Meijialong, Nanshi) has sent a letter of thanks. The books will be made available for loan for public viewing from 8:00 AM to 11:00 AM and from 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM daily.</p>
<h3>Electrocuted While Ironing Clothes</h3>

<p>A maidservant from Changshu, nearly 50 years old, who worked for the Zhang Xiurong family at No. 68 Anlan Road in Nanshi, was ironing clothes upstairs yesterday afternoon, as usual. She then went downstairs to continue ironing. Unexpectedly, the electric iron suddenly short-circuited, and she was electrocuted. She instantly became numb and fell to the ground, with the electric iron pressing against her chest. She screamed for help. The chauffeur of the residence heard the alarm and rushed to rescue her, but was almost electrocuted. The owner quickly turned off the power, but she was already unconscious. She was immediately taken to the hospital by car, but died soon after due to severe burns.</p>
<h3>Avenue Edward VII Vegetable Market Relocates</h3>
<p>The old-fashioned wooden vegetable market at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII (now Yan'an East Road) and Chengdu Road in the Western District has been in existence for many years and is very low and narrow. Since the January 28th Incident this spring, the number of residents in the area has increased sharply, and the road in front of the vegetable market is narrow. Accidents involving trams are common. The Municipal Council's Municipal Affairs Department, considering that the purpose of the vegetable market is to facilitate residents, now believes that the current location is insufficient and that it is necessary to choose a new location. Therefore, in the spring, they selected a vacant lot nearby, located in the western section of Shanhaiguan Road, Chengdu Road, and began construction of a new three-story reinforced concrete vegetable market. The location is spacious, and the stall area is one-third larger than the old vegetable market on Avenue Edward VII. The arrangement is as follows: the lower floor is dedicated to selling fish, meat, and fresh goods, and the middle floor is dedicated to selling vegetarian food and agricultural vegetables. The construction has been completed and moved in yesterday (the 21st).</p>

<h3>Declaration by the Four District Unions of the Wharf General Labor Union</h3>
<p>The declaration of the First District Union of the Shanghai Municipal Wharf General Labor Union states: "Since the restoration of this union, we have been actively working to liberate our fellow workers. Our wharf workers occupy an important position among all classes. Loading and unloading are all done by our workers. They directly facilitate transportation and indirectly benefit traffic. Although we dare not say that we have made a great contribution to society, we have at least played a part. Given the heavy responsibility and arduous work of our wharf workers, they should receive appropriate compensation so that they can work with peace of mind. However, in reality, the daily income of our wharf workers is barely enough to support themselves, let alone their families. This kind of hardship is not fully understood by outsiders. Previously, the central government, mindful of the suffering of our wharf workers, promulgated six principles, which we hoped would lead to a solution. Unexpectedly, the other party, due to various obstacles, has failed to implement them effectively. At this time when the union is working to improve the lives of our workers, we hope that the contractors will dispel their past prejudices and cooperate sincerely so that labor and capital can cooperate and disputes can be permanently eliminated. The future of the wharf labor movement will then be bright. This declaration is made."</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor, In the "Local News" section of your newspaper on the 17th of this month, there was a news item titled "Wenchu Salt Affairs Improvement Association to Hold Meeting Tomorrow," which stated that merchants were borrowing Yao salt for transportation, overcharging for sure, and that the Yongjia Party Department had filed a lawsuit with the court, and Wang Yongshan had fled to Hangzhou to escape punishment, etc. This is not in accordance with the facts. Our merchants have not overcharged for salt. Wang Yongshan has returned to Wen after completing his public duties. Since there are no criminal issues, there is no question of escape. We are deeply concerned that inaccurate rumors may cause misunderstandings. Therefore, we are writing to request that you publish a correction. Sincerely, Wenchu Salt Tax Transportation and Sales Office in Shanghai, July 21st.</p>

<h3>Notice of Intention to Organize a Society for the Discussion of Social Improvement</h3>
<p>More than half a year has passed since the reorganization of this publication. Our original aim was to improve society and promote handicrafts. We are deeply grateful for the numerous contributions of excellent articles from all of you. However, due to limited space and an excess of submissions, we regret that we have been unable to publish all the excellent articles.</p>
<p>As the Book of Changes says, "When things reach an extreme, they change. Change leads to progress, and progress leads to permanence." For the past half-year, this publication has primarily focused on negatively attacking darkness and combating evil. We have been thorough in our efforts, but if we continue to adhere to established methods and publish too many articles of this nature, both the authors and the readers may grow weary. It is like eating; if you eat the same dish every day, even the most delicious delicacies will lose their appeal. Therefore, we now intend to take a more proactive approach to provide a fresh perspective.</p>
<p>Generally, this publication mainly carries exposes of social dark sides, vivid descriptions of schools, and family problems, etc., which all represent a negative total assault, engaging in a melee with society. However, we have published little regarding how to improve or design society. We now intend to organize a Society for the Discussion of Social Improvement to solicit suggestions for improvement. We earnestly hope that you will continue to contribute your excellent articles.</p>
<p>Teahouses are often called "small courthouses" because people can freely express their opinions on political and social affairs without fear of reprisal. During the Spring and Autumn period, people in Zheng gathered in rural schools to discuss the merits and demerits of the government, which also represents freedom of speech. This publication, following this spirit, aims to make a positive contribution to society and improve its welfare. This is the purpose of organizing this society.</p>
<p>Appendix: Articles of Association of the Society for the Discussion of Social Improvement</p>
<p>Article 1: All contributors to this publication shall be members of this society.</p>
<p>Article 2: All members of this society shall have the right to make suggestions to the society and request discussions.</p>
<p>Article 3: After a member submits a suggestion to the society, if the society determines that it has value for discussion, it will publish the original text and invite collective discussion.</p>
<p>Article 4: If the proposal is approved or modified and approved by a majority, the society will publish the resolution in this publication.</p>
<p>Article 5: The discussion texts of each member may also be published in this publication, but only those with value are limited to publication.</p>
<p>Article 6: The scope of discussion for this society shall include social improvement, family improvement, marriage system improvement, personal life improvement, etc.</p>
<p>Article 7: Once a proposal is resolved, all members are requested to work hard to implement it in order to achieve the goal of improvement.</p>
<p>Article 8: These articles of association may be amended at any time if there are any improprieties.</p>
<p>Please indicate "Suggesting [something]" or "Discussing [something]" on the envelope when submitting your contributions. Contributions published in this publication will still be compensated according to the usual rates.</p>

<h3>Man-Made Red Pigments</h3>
<p>— Cunyinglou</p>
<p>In our ordinary chemical studies, we often discover that several completely different chemical raw materials, when combined in a certain quantitative ratio, can immediately transform into another substance. For example, light oxygen combines to form water, and chlorinated sodium becomes salt. This mysterious phenomenon is what makes us interested in engaging in chemical crafts. Regarding general pigments, for example, the red color used in Chinese paintings is mostly derived from natural materials. Vermilion red is made from cinnabar, crimson red is made from safflower or sappanwood, and ocher red is made from red iron ore. However, if the mixing is not done properly, the pigment may not be completely accurate. However, pigments made from chemical raw materials can be more accurate and vivid than natural pigments, as long as the mass ratio of several raw materials is appropriate.</p>
<p>There are many types of red pigments. I heard that German chemical dyeing technicians have recently discovered more than one hundred types of red. However, the ordinary so-called red can be roughly divided into crimson, scarlet, and ocher red. Other colors such as pink, orange-red, and magenta can mostly be made by mixing in other pigments. Therefore, this article intends to first introduce the above three types to readers.</p>
<p>(1) Crimson: The raw materials for crimson are two parts of sodium sulfite and three parts of hydrochloric antimony. The mixing method is to place the sodium sulfite and hydrochloric antimony separately in porcelain containers and dissolve the two substances into liquids with clean water. Then, mix the two solutions together. Sodium sulfite and hydrochloric antimony immediately undergo a chemical reaction, transforming into a crimson substance that gradually settles to the bottom of the container. When the red substance has completely settled, pour off the water on top, and then stir and wash with clean water once or twice to allow the impurities to float. At that time, remove the water containing impurities, pour the red substance settled below onto paper to filter the remaining liquid, and then put it in the sunlight to dry. Crimson pigment that can be applied is ready.</p>
<p>(2) Scarlet: Scarlet is also known as vermilion. The raw materials are eight parts of caustic potash, three parts of flowers of sulfur, and one and a half parts of mercury. The mixing method is to first grind the flowers of sulfur (i.e., crystalline powder of sulfur) into extremely fine powder, place it in a sieve to remove the coarse particles, and then place the fine powder in a porcelain container. Take mercury and mix it together, and then use a method to grind and stir it into a (saturated solution). At this time, the flowers of sulfur and mercury will combine to form a black substance. After a while, dissolve the caustic potash in water to form a liquid, and then pour this liquid into a porcelain container to mix with the flowers of sulfur and mercury. Pour it into a pot and gradually heat it over a low flame. The temperature is roughly equivalent to about 100 degrees Fahrenheit. After about a few minutes, it will turn into a scarlet pigment, which is extremely vivid. However, when burning, it is important to note that the heat should not be too high, otherwise it may turn into a dark maroon red.</p>
<p>(3) Ocher Red: Ocher red is also known as reddish-yellow. The raw materials are four parts of hydrochloric acid and seven parts of antimony trisulfide. The mixing method is to first place hydrochloric acid and a little clean water in a pot and gradually heat it over a low flame. The burning time can be about one hour. Then, pour the antimony trisulfide into the pot to mix it with the hydrochloric acid. After the hydrochloric acid and antimony trisulfide are completely mixed, place it on a gas stove to steam and cook. In about three hours, ocher red pigment will be ready. Regarding antimony trisulfide, ordinary greening antimony is dissolved in acids, and then light sulfide gas is passed in to form it. There is also naturally produced stibnite (i.e., antimony sulfide ore), and its efficacy is completely the same.</p>
<p>School Scenes</p>
<h3>Payday</h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>The salary distribution at the Capital T University is handled in two ways: senior faculty members have their salaries delivered by school staff, while junior faculty and staff members are notified to collect their salaries themselves. The general junior faculty and staff members, such as teaching assistants and assistants, as well as the general affairs clerks, accountants, tea servers, and custodians, number two or three hundred in total. Initially, the accounting office was arranged like a typical office, but later, for some reason, it was transformed into a bank office. Long counters were placed in two rooms facing the windows, making people collecting their salaries feel like they were withdrawing money from a bank or receiving mail at the post office.</p>
<p>For a while, this bank-like accounting office was crowded with three or four layers of people, including custodians, tea servers, assistants, and the kind of teaching assistant who fawned over others like a maidservant. This was probably because salaries had been in arrears for three months. Driven by poverty, the teaching assistants and assistants, even though they felt demeaned to be collecting money with custodians, had become teachers from students and could no longer care about such distinctions. They squeezed into the crowd to collect their salaries like starving people waiting for relief, unable to conceal their urgency.</p>
<p>News of the salary distribution had leaked three days prior, originating from an assistant in the A Department. The A Department assistant had been an elementary school teacher and was promoted to this position due to the trust of Professor N, with his salary increasing from thirty to eighty. He had always had good connections with the accounting office, so news of salary distribution from the accounting office could be spread by him. Many poor professors, at least part-time lecturers, and teaching assistants who acted like maidservants were willing to associate with him because of this. He had increased his status due to the expensive telegraphic transfer fee, while the "book value" of professors inevitably decreased.</p>
<p>On this day, the school was closed for the third day. The faculty members who were usually buried in their work or running around with books had become bored, listless, and disappointed. They were embarrassed to go to the small restaurants nearby, and listening to storytelling at the Confucius Temple was also impossible. They had circled around the affiliated school and were tired of it. They were extremely bored and could only hope for salary distribution in the near future.</p>
<p>Sure enough, their hopes were fulfilled. Grace came from the north, and joy came from the south. Salaries were actually being distributed! Therefore, this bank-like accounting office was crowded with these three or four layers of people for a while.</p>
<p>Professor L, who had been accustomed to living in comfort and luxury since studying abroad on government funds, always felt that the word "money" was a bit vulgar. However, at this time, he was as anxious as an editor waiting for the latest news after three o'clock. When news of the salary distribution was leaked by Assistant T, he could no longer bear it and asked L to collect it from the accounting office himself. Because the Shanghai Bank at the entrance would close at four o'clock, and he would be too late to remit it to his wife's wallet.</p>
<p>Lecturer W, Teaching Assistant L, Teaching Assistant Y, and a group of seven or eight people hurriedly followed Assistant T to the accounting office. The accounting office had a lot of business, and the accounting director had the full air of a manager. Fortunately, T had some personal connection with him, so they were able to get paid quickly. Otherwise, according to the rules, they would have to take a number, first be a number-representing human, and then have your teaching qualification canceled. After a while, Professor L, Teacher N, Teaching Assistant W, and seven or eight people arrived at a small restaurant nearby. Old Wang smiled broadly, and Teaching Assistant T sighed inwardly, thinking that this was the only consolation.</p>
<p>Sexual Issues</p>
<h3>Memories of Flesh</h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>My friend Mr. Wu spent four dollars to buy a kiss, and saliva flowed down his back. I have heard this joke countless times. Today, I accidentally met him, and I specifically asked about the origin of this joke. The following is what he told me:</p>
<p>(Friend, you know, and you should understand, when a young man's wife is not by his side, especially during the season when peach blossoms are in full bloom, it is probably very difficult for him to restrain himself and not commit any wrongdoing, right? To be honest, I need sexual adjustment in my physiology. Forgive me for not being able to put more effort into supporting myself. What's more, under this private ownership system, even women are commodities. However, due to lack of money, I was able to support myself from the peach blossom season until the summer when girls and young women only cover their bodies with light gauze, trying their best to drive us men crazy. One particularly hot evening, I intentionally let myself while away in the breeze of the movie theater's electric fans. The kissing and embracing on the screen intoxicated me in fantasy. You know, there were couples all around me, whispering sweet nothings while their hair and beards rubbed together. At the same time, I vaguely recognized that there was a foreign girl close to me. She was wearing an open chest, revealing her arms, ________. So I felt dizzy, I was confused, and I was intimidated by all these temptations. However, on the screen, lips were still being sucked tightly, and lovers were still whispering intimately. Afterward, I felt that the foreign girl was moving closer to me inch by inch. I understood what this meant, so I boldly sat closer to her. Of course, she did not reject me, which made me even bolder. I felt her body temperature, and I smelled the scent of her flesh. Friend, you must understand how excited I was at this time. My heart was beating wildly, and my blood was rushing. In addition, the woman intentionally smiled at me several times and blew cigarette smoke in my face. At this moment, the devil grabbed my soul, and actually made me bravely hold her hand. ________ Of course, I disregarded everything. I only knew that she was a woman, she was the woman I needed, and who cared about anything else? Not long after, we walked out of the movie theater hand in hand, and she leaned against my chest. In the car driving to her home, she held my hand tightly and said to me in a passionate but clumsy English tone: (You love me?) (Yes, I love you, my dear!) So she suddenly leaned forward, hugged my head, and kissed me wildly, passionately, for a long time, kissing and sucking so hard that I could barely breathe. Because I was lying on my back at the time, her saliva and my saliva flowed from the corners of my mouth to my cheeks, and then from my cheeks all the way down to my back.)</p>
<p>(Ah!) I couldn't help but laugh and say, (What a passionate kiss!) Afterwards, my friend Mr. Wu continued: (But later I found out that she was a prostitute, a white Russian woman. Reason told me that I must not buy syphilis at a high price, so I left four dollars and resolutely left her residence. However, friend! Her warm lips and her arms are still in my memory to this day).</p>
<p>Idle Special Theory</p>
<h3>The Result of Spoiling</h3>
<p>— Yiping</p>
<p>M has a reputation as a socialite in our school. He wears very elegant suits, and he has a beautiful face. Whether it's a school gathering, M is as indispensable as licorice in medicine. Because of his social skills, our casual conversations turned into a deep friendship.</p>
<p>There were only mother and son in his family. M was born when his mother was in her forties. Of course, she was extremely happy to have a son late in life. After his father died, his mother spoiled him even more. Because his father had made a fortune in business, the lives of the mother and son were very comfortable.</p>
<p>Sometimes on Sundays, he would invite a few friends to his house, and his mother would provide elaborate meals and refreshments. His mother's psychology was that she was afraid that M would go out to play on his days off and be led astray by bad friends. She was more than happy for him to play the huqin or even play a few rounds of mahjong at his house.</p>
<p>M's social skills were indeed not weak. Not long after graduating, he had a small reputation in society. He was indispensable to all kinds of meetings and events reported in newspapers. As for me, I was busy seeking a way out for a living, so our relationship became distant. Later, when I wanted to ask him for a favor, I went to his old residence where he played the huqin, but M had already moved out. According to the new owner, M had moved to a new residence because the old residence was insufficient for his needs. It was also a coincidence that I encountered M's mother at the entrance of a certain village on my way home. She was staring blankly in the opposite direction. The old woman, who was originally very healthy, was now haggard and her head was full of silver hair. I called out "Auntie," and she seemed startled. Then, forcing a smile, she said, "Mr. Zhang, it's been a long time. Have you run into our A Jin (M's nickname)?" She also invited me into a new residence, which was more elaborate than before. After the servant served tea, she told me, "Since graduating, M has been wandering around all day, returning no earlier than ten o'clock in the evening. I always wait for him at the door several times a day, asking if he has been invited to a banquet by some important person or celebrity. The other day, there was even a woman looking for him. Mr. Zhang, can you advise him? You used to be good friends." I saw that her behavior and tone of voice showed that she loved her son to the point of sickness. I comforted her with a few random words.</p>
<p>Less than a month later, I received a red invitation card from M, inviting me to his wedding. As the wedding of a famous socialite, of course, all the worthies and sages would be present. Many old classmates also came. M's mother was even more beaming with joy, welcoming guests. This day, it was noisy and boisterous until 3:00 AM.</p>
<p>Thus, M's reputation became even greater, transforming from a socialite to a well-known figure in Shanghai.</p>
<p>When I went to visit him for the second time, his old mother was already seriously ill in bed. When she saw me, it seemed like she wanted to greet me but could not open her mouth. Besides a few female servants by the bedside, M's uncle, with tears streaming down his face, said to me, "My sister has worked hard all her life, and you friends all know how much she treasures A Jin. But after he got married, he moved out. Now the old lady is about to die, and he still hasn't been found _______." M's uncle was already sobbing uncontrollably.</p>
<p>A male servant rushed in in a fit of panic, "(Old___sir, I went to the new mansion, and A Fu said that he and the young mistress had gone to a tea party with some section chief. I further explored the address of some section chief's house and hurried over. The doorman there said that they had just gone for a drive with the section chief and his wife)."</p>
<p>The old lady suddenly cried out tragically and returned to the ethereal realm.</p>
<p>(The death of the mother of a famous socialite, this news will probably shock Shanghai again _______ The funeral will be held in the future, and the posthumous glory will be even more prosperous for a time?) I thought this way on the road.</p>
