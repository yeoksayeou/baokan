<h3>吳城戰事漸趨穩定　修河兩軍對峙華佔優勢</h3>
<p>激戰多日日屍盈千華軍入有力陣地</p>
<p>日機狂炸被擊落一架餘均負創逸去</p>
<p>常德　軍事機關接南昌電告、大隊日機、分批在修水一帶竟日輪流轟炸、掩護日兵作戰、南潯路戰事、華日兩方現在修水之三公渡對峙中、情況非常激烈、華方迄佔優勢、（二十三日電）</p>
<p>（重慶）此間負責方面聲稱、日方顯欲進展南昌、現分兵六路向南昌推進、以主力部隊進攻永修區域、戰事現由鄱陽湖東岸之都昌、擴展至西岸之吳城、並經永修·虬津·箬溪·及武寗一帶、繼續向西擴展、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>（南昌）廿一日、日機數度飛修河南岸轟炸、華高射部隊予以猛烈射擊、當有日機一架、中彈起火、立時墮落華陣地前、餘機亦多受創、狼狽逃逸、（廿三日電）</p>
<p>（香港）據悉、贛北局勢緊張、永修西岸、虬津附近、日軍廿日發砲終日、至晚日軍分數處渡修水、現正與華軍激戰、獅山一帶、情況不明、修河上游之武寗東北上灘頭、羅盤山華軍、轉移陣地、日軍西達至大腦尖、灰家山之綫、（廿三日下午就時專電）</p>
<p>（漢口）華軍對於偷渡修水之日軍、正力加壓阻、聞雙方在修水迤南之自魯橋及行水龍相持中、其戰綫已延長至二十公里、聞華軍方面正在永修迤南之安壟橋設置砲兵陣地、并將竄至安義之一批日軍流動部隊加以殲滅、聞在安石至萬家埠公路上、華方集有大兵、足以阻壓日軍之進展、而南昌迤北一帶、華方集有重兵尤多、又關於武寗一路之日軍、已慘遭敗績、其被華軍消滅者不下六百五十人、而修水江面、日軍亦有屍身千餘具、漂流其中、蓋均在強渡時所犧牲、（二十三日快訊社電）</p>

<p>（重慶）贛北日軍進攻南昌之野心益顯、二十一日以第六第一〇六兩師團計二萬人爲主力、卿全力分數路向修河畔之武寗猛犯、雙方遂展開空前血戰、華軍拼死力拒、日軍迄晚毫無進展、仍在武寗郊外陳莊一帶對峙中、二十一日晨、華軍指揮羅卓英將軍親自騎馬至前綫督戰、援軍復大批開到、故贛北前方華軍士氣大旺、於當日卽開始反攻、與日軍展開白刃戰、同時並有華軍一部偷渡修河、包抄日軍後方砲兵陣地、經一度激戰、日池田部隊卽告不支、被擊斃七百餘、殘部日軍皆紛紛棄械而逃、華軍遂截獲大砲三十二尊、奈因無法携行、乃置炸藥將其全部破壞、待日大軍趕到、華軍皆已安返陣地矣、（二十三日快訊社電）</p>
<p>（香港）日方在此間雖宣傳謂已在南潯路上、有所進展、并有佔領安義之說、惟依華方消息、則日軍尚被阻於深家埠、該埠係在永修迤西二十二公里之處、日軍對於深家埠之軍略地位、似頗加以重視、日來屢以坦克車向該處進攻、均不得逞、惟有若干之步兵流動部隊、已竄入安龍橋及下馬源等地、但經華軍發覺後、當卽加以殲滅、日軍以陸地方面、華軍抵抗甚力、無法進展、乃謀以空軍打開血路、故連日以來、派有八十餘架之飛機、在華軍後方輒肆轟炸、（二十三日快訊社電）</p>

<p>興集　虞鄉民衆年在十八至三十歲者、日軍已開始徵調、附近居民逃避一空、解縣日軍近揚稱將封鎖中條山各要口、並聲言於週內斷絕平陸·芮城間交通、同蒲路現修至解縣西部斜村、路基修至東西胡村、聞擬延長至虞鄉、所需道木、迫僞保安隊四出砍伐、並向解西各村、強索道木四千根（二十三日電）</p>

<p>舉世憂惶恐懼於戰禍之將至者，已非朝夕；危機四伏，人懷茍安，但願多方審慎，俾免一觸卽發。詎知數日之前，德意志元首希特勒氏竟攫捷克斯拉夫而縊之。此何如事？慕尼黑保障捷克殘境之墨瀋未乾，國社黨宗奉種族主義之標揭宛在；自英法乃至於蘇美，豈不憤然作態，以爲一之爲甚，是可忍耶；於是正直忠厚之倫，爲日耳曼族將遭惡報而惜，更爲整個人羣將遭刧運而悲；蓋實逼處此，僉以爲觸及導火綫矣，瞬即爆發耳，獨希特勒氏處之夷然，且絕不暇逸，再接再厲，復以哀的美敦，向立陶宛國，索米美爾區；一索即得。此所以答復國際之呶呶者，曰，我行我素，事實若此也；此所以告慰舉世之惴惴者，日，我置米美爾於卍旗之下，不費一彈，不流滴血，天下本無事也。</p>
<p>經年以來，世道人心劇變：國境更張，輿圖變色；强懦異趨，聲勢消長；國際喪其遵循之常軌，人類喪其共通之信仰。論者輒指摘德義日之敝屣道義，毀棄條的，倒行逆施，食言背信；馴致秩序蕩然，禍患相尋。夫溯本窮源，咎屬罪魁，責在禍首，德義日自應負其全責，日本允無所逃於天下後世之責難。雖然，嚴格論之，彼玩法亂紀之可誅，顧枉法苟安者可恕耶？日本蹂躪遼寗，九國公的之簽字者安在？義大利用兵阿比西尼亞，國際聯盟之制裁安在？德意志覬覦蘇台德區，國際聯盟固未置一辭，顧與捷克締盟之法蘇安在？西班牙內戰，明知助亂者三軍並用，而封鎖邊界焉。禁運軍火焉，儼然守法衛道之國家焉。及乎日本關閉門，義大利不撒志願兵，德意志割捷克而更併奧地利；各國於其諾言不復踐行當然之責任，於其簽字之條的，不復顧及神聖之義務；於是一再演變而如今茲。於是言之：凡敝屣道義，毀棄條的，倒行逆施，食言背信，若德義日之出之以積極行動者，洵爲人類文明之罪人；而藐視責任，放棄義務，若英法諸國者，亦以其消極而對於國際喪失常軌，人類喪失信仰，負有嚴重之罪戾。果報不爽，有直披其頰者；是在明於責德義日，而昧於自責者，可以廢然知返，而奮然有所作爲歟？</p>
<p>當今之世，德義日爲侵略國家，或深惡而痛絕之，或戒懼而防範之；此一致之心理，一致之態度也。披彼逆鱗，迎頭痛擊之者，惟有中華民國。若對於德義日，限止其擴展，抗拒其侵略，則衆望屬之於英法。英法迄今無甚作爲，然國家之有遭受德義日侵略之可能者，罔不以獲英法之靑睞爲重；是事勢使然，亦情理應爾也。於是英矜持，自以爲負天下之重任；美國同情，亦以英法乃民治砥柱而視爲聲援之對象焉。詎知慨然允許北歐以保障，而挪威報之以冷酷之辭；折然草擬集體之宣言，而波蘭絕之以孤立之說；是則可見毀滅國際常軌，搖撼人羣共信者，德義日固屬咎無可辭，顧已形成普遍之毀滅與搖撼，雖英法未能獨善焉。人類之不免於浩刧，此非端倪也歟？</p>
<p>據二十日挪威電訉；挪威於獲悉英國方面表示願予北歐諸國以保障之後；挪威衆議院長韓勃勒應之日，我人旣未求保障，亦不希望任何一國或數國，以任何形式，保障我國之安全；又謂余於國際保障安全之諾言，素不置信云。又據二十一日倫敦電訉：英國所擬集體安全宣言，法俄兩國無問題，但波蘭拒不參加；謂與法國有成的，與羅馬尼亞可隨時接洽；窺其眞意，乃因宣言未必可恃，徒以開罪德國，是在不取云。夫保障安全，聯名宣言，謂非針對惡劣現實之大手筆歟？挪威波蘭二國，復非不足禦暴自衛，有待强援之弱小歟？顧乃出此態度，可知國際共守之常軌，人類共通之信仰，盪然無存；必須重行建立，始得重見效騐。德義日不足責，要在英法諸國，自此踐行責任，肩負義務；國際情勢庶有澄淸之望。彼希特勒悍然不顧一切而恣肆者，謂非覷破英法徒言不行之故哉！</p>

<h3>波蘭處境困難　共同宣言一時尙難發表</h3>
<p>法書面我們答復英國無保留參加</p>
<p>蘇聯態度亦在模棱兩可之中</p>
<p>（倫敦）法國外長龐萊頃於本日午後、在下議院與張伯倫首相哈里法克斯外相會談一小時半、英國外務部决官賈德幹、中歐司司長史特朗、法國大使考賓、龐萊外長機要秘書勃萊西諸人皆均在座、據此間負責人士宣稱、關於東歐洲集體安全制組織問題、龐萊外長曾以書面答案、面交張伯倫首相、聲明法國對於英國所提出之共同宣言書草案、無保留的加以接受、似此英法兩國除保有軍事互助義務而外、其在西歐方面、一俟荷蘭比利時或瑞士國遭受侵略時、亦且有自動加以援助之義務、此外、英法兩國政府並曾向羅馬尼亞國提供切實保證、聲明該國若果遭受攻擊、英法兩國决不坐視、今後若能與蘇聯波蘭兩國發表共同宣言、其在東歐洲方面、又須接受範圍較大之的束矣、據一般人所知、波蘭對於英國所提建議、雖已表示謝絕、但英國駐波大使凱納爵士、仍當於明日與波蘭政府接洽、勸其改變初衷、特恐波蘭對於羅馬尼亞國、不願接受切實的約束、而在政治軍事上、因蘇聯之故、接受何項約束、亦且猶豫不决耳、關於此層、該國外長柏克上校、下月前來倫敦與英國當局進行談話後、或當有所决定、亦未可必、至以蘇聯提議召集國際會議而論、英法兩國原曾一度反對、據聞茲又擬加以接受云、（二十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）關於東歐洲集體安全制組織問題、英國政府自向法國、波蘭、蘇聯三國提出共同宣言書草案之後、波蘭政府業已拒不參加、法國則無保留的表示贊同、頃據此間蘇聯人士宜稱、該國政府雖迄未提出正式答案、預料定必樂於加入、或當要求採用較爲堅决之詞語、並爲參加各國規定較爲切實之的束、亦未可必、特蘇聯即使提出此項要求、亦不以之作爲先决條件云、按英國政府所提草案、內容聞極簡單、略謂愛好和平各國務當團結一致、一俟遇有緊急情事、危及歐洲和平時、應立即互相諮詢、以便「决定抵抗侵略步驟」云、（二十二日哈瓦斯）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英國主張由英法薛波四國發表共同宣言書、聲明對德國將來之任何專斷行動、擬一致對付一節、蘇聯或波蘭政府迄今尙未答覆、據此間聲稱、此項宣言書星期一始經卓定、故關係各國政府之覆文、連同修正文、數日之內、殊難全到、倫敦充分惑覺波蘭所處之地位與他國不同、故料波政府或將提出異議、稍緩、關係各國得暇商定實際的詳則後、則或將使此初步計劃、更含具體方式、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）此間觀察家咸認波蘭處境困難、四周被圍之不安情緒、隨米美爾之命運而加甚、今若參加不利於德國之宣言、則定引起不愉快之後果、衆信德國所以尊重波蘭在但澤與波格明之地位者、徒因波蘭不密切參加仇視德國之政策耳、（二十二日路透電）</p>
<p>華沙　英大使康那德爵士今日謁波蘭外長柏克、衆似曾討論英國所主發表反對侵略宣言之計畫、（二十二日路透電）</p>
<p>華沙　官塲潑表一文、聲明波蘭認波羅的海區域與波蘭直接利益有關係、此間人士解釋稱、此爲波蘭對德之暗示、即波蘭將認德國勢力在立陶宛擴充、而至米美爾之外、則與波蘭利益衝突是也（二十三日路透）</p>
<p>（倫敦）關於東歐洲集體安全制組織問題、現有兩種辦法、（一）由英法蘇三國先行發表共同宜言、然後邀請其他各關係國加入、（二）短時期內在倫敦或在巴黎召集國際會議、關於此層、英國政府當於明日有所决定、緣自波蘭拒不加入之後、蘇聯政府、旣延未提出正式答案、巴爾幹半島各國、非俟英國接受更較切實的約束、似亦不願公開表明立塲、因而英國政府亦不能不將召集國際會議之議從新加以考慮也、惟是蘇聯政府若能於明日提出答案、無保留贊成英國原來計劃、則英國政府仍主由英法蘇三國發表共同宜言、然後經由外交途徑邀請其他各國加入（廿二日哈瓦斯）</p>
<p>（倫敦）此間金融界人士頃宜稱、德國兼併捷克國波希米亞與摩拉維亞兩省之後、英國政府已就東歐洲集體安全制組織問題、與各關係國政府交換意見、俾克聯合一致抵抗侵略、同時决與德國進行經濟戰爭、允以在巴爾幹半島爲甚、大抵英國首當向羅馬尼亞國有所努力、並派遺商業考察團前往該國、爲英國出口貨推廣銷路、遇有必要時、或用津貼方式、援助本國出口商人、此外、英國在南斯拉夫希臘兩國、向僅維持原有經濟地位、未償與德國競爭、今後亦常翻然變計、而以全力與之角逐、其在南美洲方面、亦當如此、消息靈通人士並謂、德國貨物輸入英國時、或常徵收附加稅、正未可必云、（二十二日哈瓦斯）</p>
<h3>張伯倫演說　對德尙留餘地</h3>
<p>（倫敦）首相張伯倫今日在下院陳述國際大局、謂政府業已表明、德政府最近行動、已引起德國是否將不以不斷的努力、企圖統治全歐甚至更甚於此之問題、如德國確抱此意志、則英政府覺當聲明者、前車可鑒、此種企圖必引起實愛目由之英國與其他各國之有效的抵抗、最近發展之結果與共他政府會商之情形、渠今尙不能發表、繼日、余所願聲明者、德國如以合理的努力、擴張其輸出貿易、英政府殊不欲梗阻其進行、英政府且不欲使歐洲各國、對彼等內部行政方式具不同之主義者、成對壘之局、吾人所唯一關切之主題、厥爲吾人不能聽令獨立之國家受人壓迫、及受武力之威脅、而不得不放棄彼等之獨立、首相結語曰、如有人希圖實行此種手續、則吾人决以權力所能行使之各種方法抗拒之云、（二十三日路透電）</p>

<p>義國職業團體議會開幕</p>
<p>（倫敦）下星期日墨索里尼演說時、將吾提出殖民地耍求、倫敦對此紛起猜測、數方面以爲、今非作此要求之時、惟路透訪員自消息靈通方面探悉、墨氏必宜布義國之要求、而將以堅决平稱之言詞出之、惟衆認墨氏爲深明現實者、當不致向法提出類於哀的美敦書之要求、或使其要求、具有排除互商解决可能性之方式、聞法國某某方面今切欲與墨氏討論各事、外間關於賣兩政府間文書之人物、已頗多謠言、是可證兩政府正謀從事談判也、（二十三日路透電）</p>

<h3>一週戰况</h3>
<p>（重慶）軍事委員會發言人談本週（三月十六至二十二日）戰况云、本週南北各綫均無大規模戰事、日軍殆已氣衰力竭、從事補充調整、企圖再犯、以掙扎其垂死之生命、然在我全軍將士、蹈隙乘虛、消耗敵軍之情勢下、敵軍受創極深、頗有特爲報道之價値、就全般戰局言之、的如後述、</p>
<p>廣東方面　近來敵軍調動頻繁、純係虛張聲勢、一面於粵漢增城從化各綫、加緊構築防禦工事、於海南島海口秀英各處趕修砲台、文昌·定安各處開闢飛機倉庫機塲、爲空軍根據地之建築、有困守久踞模樣、至於零星戰鬥、我敵兩軍、先後於順德·大良·神岡·定安·文昌·瓊山各地曾發生激戰、瓊山之役、敵元田大佐陣亡、敵機亦迭飛大邱·黎洞·英德等地濫施轟炸、盲目投彈、我損失甚微、現各路敵軍均在我絕對控制之下、</p>
<p>贛北方面　進犯廬山敵軍、迭經我軍予以重創、已平靜多日、前日上午、敵兵一部藉飛機六架掩護、復向好漢坡方面蠢動、圖進犯牯嶺、經我守軍猛力迎擊、斃敵百餘、我砲兵發射準確、擊傷敵機二架、敵狼狽敗潰、都昌戰事仍甚激烈、自我反攻克復縣城、十六日續克大磯山、並擊破由城南登陸之敵後、敵勢大挫、另一部敵軍四五百、於德安東南吳城鎭湖面對岸葉家留登陸、圖進窺吳城、以相呼應、經我猛烈砲擊、敵傷亡甚多、修水北岸之敵、自十七日下午向我觀音閣·狗子嶺發砲十餘發、多屬催淚毒彈、入夜更以步兵四五百、分向山下杜馬村·覜音閣·陳村附近渡河、有進犯涂家埠趨勢、經我奮勇迎擊、激戰極烈、雙方傷亡均重、現仍對戰中、</p>
<p>山西方面　晋凍困踞浮山之敵千餘、日來經我不斷襲擊、傷亡甚多、一部已西竄、殘留城內之敵五百餘、十七日下午我軍復分路乘勢圍攻、激戰數小時、斃敵三百餘名、殘敵不支、向臨汾逃竄、當晚七時、將縣城克復、晋南安邑·霍縣·臨晋各地、我敵迭有激戰、十九日午、圍攻臨晋之際、該處偽皇協軍蘇超羣部千名、器械齊備、於我軍迫近敵陣時、乘機全體反正、敵前後受攻、斃傷四百餘名、已蹶不振、尙縣自十一日經我克復後、十九日敵復傾巢反攻、砲火極烈、我軍以决死之心、與敵鏖戰竟日、雙方陣地出入數次、同時另一部我軍並乘敵力分散、突襲靜樂、於城北地區、殲敵三百餘名、現靜樂仍在我圍攻中、</p>
<p>河南方面　盤踞安陽·水治鎭之敵軍、附砲數門、十九日午由山本隊長率領、向我進犯、經我駐軍督同地方團隊抵抗、激戰三小時、斃敵二百餘、山本亦同時授首、殘敵不支、紛紛潰竄、現已直迫水冶、溫縣敵軍、十六十七兩日曾迭向我鞏縣南河渡·氾水溝·氾水村及車站砲擊、經我軍發砲還擊、將敵制壓、我另一部勁旅並在河北岸繞襲敵軍之背、敵死傷甚重、殘部紛向武涉·沁陽方面潰竄、中牟西北三仆寨、敵一部十九日午向來同塞進犯、激戰五小時、敵不支回竄、我乘勝追抵櫟橋、將守敵百餘殲滅、當克復該地、二十日晨敵由開封調來大批援軍、猛烈反攻、並大放毒氣、我軍以陣地被燬、乃撒回來同寨、與敵鏖戰、傍晚敵勢如潮而至、因衆寡懸殊、我遂暫時退出該寨、刻正積極佈置新陣地、增援反攻、</p>
<p>鄂中方面　自鍾祥淪陷以來、敵軍卽積極修築漢宜京鍾兩路、並趕染洋梓「鍾祥北十公里」一帶工事、從事固守、故週來該方面戰况沉寂、惟多實灣敵軍連日不斷向對岸砲擊、經我發砲還擊、竟射中敵火藥庫、敵損失奇重、另多實灣束南泗港渡口之敵、曾於十六七八三日間、在襄河西岸之張家塲·紅廟·王家廠·數度企圖登陸、經我軍痛擊、斃敵極衆、卒不獲逞、現各該地已無敵蹤、我敵兩軍、仍隔河砲戰、成膠着狀態、敵軍固襄河柬岸之企圖、在我軍四方八面襲攻情况之下决難實現</p>

<h3>菲當局苛待華僑</h3>
<p>對入境者施行週身檢查</p>
<p>任意携取旅客所帶物品</p>
<p>菲律賓通訊、菲律賓羣島是太平洋中許多島嶼聯合而成的、原屬美國、爲美國在遠東方面的海空軍根據地、自從美國國會通過菲島獨立案後、在名義上菲律賓也是世界上獨立國家之一、華僑在菲島的大都以營商和做工爲業、人數很可觀、多從我國福建省移去、所以閩南語言、在菲律賓幾可和菲語抗衡、普徧通行、美國頒布移民律後、菲律賓也有限制華工的禁令、然而對於來菲律賓旅行和小住的人們、並不甚虐待、菲島獨立之後、菲人對待華人、就大不相同了、茲將最近記者遊菲所受到的待遇和感想、漫錄數則、使讀者知道僑胞在外所受痛苦之一斑、</p>
<p>檢查甚嚴</p>
<p>海進菲港、海關衛生局就派人登輪檢查身體、兩臂的牛痘、防疫注射的證書、兩目的砂眼、乃至全身各部、加以檢視、設若發現有了疾病的象徵、那就要禁居在所謂「水厝」的水牢裏、候船驅逐出境、身體表面各部檢視許可后、還要檢大便、倘若一時無從大便、檢騐吏便用橡皮管灌藥水、強迫取糞、三四等旅客、經衛生局許可、仍須監禁在船上二十四小時、方能登陸、</p>
<p>迫印指紋</p>
<p>登陸後、行李不能隨身自帶、須由海關提去檢騐、並卽須向移民局報到、先將出口證、（返國時所請的證書）換取居留證、換取手續、極爲麻煩、先須拍正側兩面的照像、親身送到移民局、局方就根據新律、領證人須當面將十指指紋、印在各種紙張三十餘處之多、局方如果對於你的手續、還沒有研究清楚的話、居留證還得靜候兩三星期、方能領出、不過印指紋的辦法、是專對待中國人的、記得當時曾用英語向之質問、雖然對於懂英語的人、手續上稍爲便當一些、然而虐待的方法、還是一致的、</p>
<p>種種需索</p>
<p>居留證發給後、方能向海關提取行李、不論大小、皆須經關員澈底檢查、檢查的立義、名爲檢查漏稅和違禁品、其實却是檢點查明行李箱篋中有所可取的物件否、好在他們的慾望不高、物無分大小、品無分粗細、得便卽拿去充作自己的東西、有一人取之不足、及二連三的人來伸手需索、毫不避忌、記者購備送親友的江西磁器佛像等物、固然被他們取去、卽備自用的餅乾水菓等物、莫不被上下人等、需索一空、如果行囊不豐、不能滿其所欲時、至少亦得美人一支香烟、否則多方留難、令人困苦不已、</p>
<h3>日軍南侵已呈頹勢　華軍準備總反攻</h3>
<p>吳余韋鄧分任總指揮</p>
<p>香港通訊、中國抗戰轉變至第二期後、五閱月來、各區戰塲仍無大變動、惟各戰區軍隊之補充訓練、人士之配合調整、政治工作之擴大活動、均較以前爲積極、至於新空軍之秘密增強、機械化部隊之精密組織、交通運輸之規劃改善、均具有相當之成績、足以鞏固長期抗戰之陣綫、但目前全面所採之策略、爲軍事取守、政治取攻、此即最高領袖所謂政治重於軍事、後方重於前方之旨也、日前桂林召開西南軍事會議、亦本此旨、已決定各種計劃、而降東南西北各綫</p>
<p>大家調整</p>
<p>準備至某種程度、然後舉行全面總反攻、關於東綫之惠潮梅方面、以吳總司令奇偉任前敵總指揮、北綫之粵路北段、以余總司令漢謀任前敵總指揮、南綫之高雷欽廉方面、以韋軍長雲淞任前敵總指揮夏總司令威、則兼任策劃西南兩綫、蓋西南兩綫爲日軍進窺廣西必經之道路、故桂林會議之後、特別注重、所有桂省訓練完成之</p>
<p>精銳部隊</p>
<p>已盡量東下、配備於西南兩路第一綫之前面、其第二綫至第三綫、亦層層布置得力軍隊、最近中央復加派機械化部隊五師調到桂柳一帶、可見桂粵邊之國防、其實力已異常充足、某高級軍事長官曾語人云、在三四個月之前、廣州棄守後、倘日軍速向西江上游推進、則西綫或將縮短至某處、現在則不然、蓋現在各路戰綫之兵力、較前</p>
<p>加強十倍</p>
<p>且於堅壁清野四個字、亦切實辦到、不再後退寸步、就令日軍頃全力進犯、再深入一步、必更危險一步也、吾人又反觀日軍方面、於四五個月來、共前綫哨止於三水上游之橄崗·木棉·角尾·一帶、與華軍隔河對峙、不過千餘公尺、雖屢次增兵、旅進旅退、卒未敢越河推進半步、東綫則止於石龍·博羅·蘇村·正果、北綫止於花縣·新街及從化神崗一帶、對於廣州外衛綫、似較兩月前更爲縮小、可見其兵力不敷分配、</p>
<p>南路方面</p>
<p>自佔領南海島後、其艦隊雖不時出沒於雷州半島海岸及北海洋面、而其目的亦不外裝模作態、以封鎖我海岸綫而已、因此判斷、日軍尚無能力深入廣西、可斷言也、西南戰事在僵化中、某外交方面曾謂、日方對華策略、未誘華方屈服謀和之陰謀仍然未變、而以全副精神、武裝海南全島、配合外交手腕、</p>
<p>威脅英法</p>
<p>以消弭英法支持中國抗戰之力量、促成謀和之詭計、故對於華南方面之軍事、暫採守勢、不願長驅深入、作重大的消耗與犧牲、日方基此策略、於是在華南佔領區域內、祗圖保守據點、扶植僞組織、掠奪華南富庶之物資、供彼之給養、以維持殘喘久延之局勢、粵方各路戰綫之陷入停頓狀態、亦原因於此也、</p>
<h3>梁寒操談　中國戰術進步</h3>
<p>日本則日趨退步</p>
<p>桂林通訊、西南行營政治部梁主任寒操、自六日來桂林後、忙着出席整補會議和政工會議、最近會議已經結束、昨晚、記者得着機會會見了梁主任、梁主任年月四十、精神和體格都顯得十分壯健、記者問他對於此次整補政工會的印象怎樣、梁主任的回答是、此次會議有很大的收穫、席間滿溢團結和洽的氣氛、對於過去工作的檢討以及今後工作計劃都有正確的批判和詳盡的討論、關於第二期抗議的政治實施、梁主任發表精闢的意見、並且對抗戰表示十分樂觀、他講日本是退步的戰爭而我國是進步的戰爭、這在各方面都表現着、日軍費與兵力的小號已超過他預算無限、國內經濟已到崩潰的懸崖、日兵對於本國的經濟穩固的失却信仰、足見國內經濟情形的一般、就國際上說、民主國英美都給我貸款、蘇聯亦予我切實幫助、以及舉世給我國的同情和援助、都足使日本國際地位日趨孤立、講到今後西南政治工作、梁主任對此已有整個計劃、現在正待開始訓練大批失業失學青年、到軍隊裏去、加緊軍隊政治工作、一邊孤立士兵作戰、一邊擴充軍隊、總之、抗戰已入第二階段、我國新的力量在長成、而日本泥足已陷入不可拔的深潭了</p>

<h3>金融　北幫轉買爲賣　現金價突又下降</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市況、突然重復趨疲、蓋港幫買意轉淡、及北幫反進爲出之故、當天情勢則先疲後堅、全視供求多寡爲轉移、初因證券幫大量拋塞、且某銀樓吸購不力、傾向下游、一度最低曾退達二千〇六十八元、但不久因金號暨某銀號及某掮客等均趁低價、爭先購買、致復衝出二千〇七十元關外、後以供求轉稀、漸呈盤旋局勢、結果軋跌九元五角、各方人心尚平、交易不旺、約六百餘兩、銀樓飾金亦先跌後回、終則軋小一元、海關金暨中英純金等均無變更、</p>
<h3>烚赤跌九元半</h3>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開因人心重復稍疲、且證券幫賣意頗濃、故其時進者大都觀望、遂由二千〇八十五六元、直喊低至七十五元、方見做開、首由金號賣予某銀樓五十兩、二千〇七十五元爲開盤價、較上日做低十一元、開後某銀樓又吸進證券幫五十兩、七十三元、繼之證券幫又賣予某銀號五十兩、價七十元、再售予金號五十兩、六十八元、此後證券幫已止售旁觀、故遂反動向上、金號進銀樓幫五十兩、七十五元、繼某錢兌業忽來吐售、賣予同業五十兩、七十八元、又售予某銀號五十兩、價七十七元、後另一錢兌業亦跟踪拋塞、賣予某掮客五十兩、價七十六元、及銀樓幫五十兩、價七十四元、其時錢兌業又售予銀樓幫五十兩、價七十二元、因聞美匯爲狀略軟、故價遂重向上升、錢兌業進銀樓幫五十兩、七十六元爲午收價、午後市況轉呆、價亦穩定、而成交則寥落、僅金號吸進錢兌業五十兩、七十六元、後又購進錢兌業五十兩、七十六元五角、此後買方喊七十八元、但售者須七十九元方肯供給、雙方直擯持至四時仍未做開、故晚收價仍作二千〇七十六元五角、結果較之前收軋跌九元五角、全天十元差度、現金號之本牌金售出價二千〇八十五元、收進二千〇七十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、</p>
<h3>首飾金小一元</h3>
<p>銀樓首飾金、每兩兌出初均未更、迨至十時因烚赤潛勢復疲、故亦掛小二元、後至正午因烚赤形勢稍堅、故亦回大一元、結果大同行改懸二百十一元、新同行爲二百〇九元、收進二百〇三元、</p>
<h3>英純金未更動</h3>
<p>廿二日倫敦金、英純金每盎司未更、仍未七鎊八先令五辦士、致中央銀行之中國先進收買價亦仍屬一千二百十一元六角、掛牌海關金亦未更改、計二元三角九分四厘、上海標準標金價亦仍計一千二百〇六元九角、</p>
<h3>英美金票獨升</h3>
<p>昨日英純金未動、英美匯兌回降零六二五、本埠外匯、洋行結款稍盛、港電與銀行供給不弱、潛勢穩定、惟英美互　復緊、故英匯平而美匯微弱、烚赤開盤、驟形虛弱、散戶趁高拋塞、獲利了結、雖客幫納胃甚暢、一度回漲、終以求不敵供、復趨下落、下午人心恍惚、交易驟稀、投機無隙可乘、勢趨盤旋、外幣因匯票穩定、烚赤人心恍惚、交易甚少、僅英美金票稍有需求、微趨上升、其他各幫、但無榮辱、公會交易無做開、昨日市價、僅英金票升五分、美金票升一分、其他各幣俱無更動、</p>
<h3>大條續降印銀疲軟</h3>
<p>二十二日倫敦電、投機家賣出、印度照掛牌買進、市面平、收盤后市況繼平、大條銀近遠期續縮〇六二五、紐約銀電、美銀價依舊呆定、又孟買銀電、印銀復疲、現貨縮六安那、三月降五安那、四月跌四安那、</p>
<h3>貼現率無軒輊</h3>
<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率、每千元仍呆站五十元〇二角半之間、最低爲五十元、後又站五十元〇二角半、與前日價無軒輊、</p>
<h3>英匯穩定美匯緊</h3>
<p>匯市昨以洋行雖扒、但以港電仍來吐售、且外商銀行供塞亦殷、致爲狀頗穩、而美匯則因英美匯兌略帶疲軟、加以賣方供意淡薄、故稍趨軟化、當日仍鮮變動、成交亦清、至港匯則續趨鬆賤、乃錢兌業力塞之故、</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近遠須縮〇六二五、紐約銀價仍平、倫敦生金亦無升降、匯兌英對美·對法·對滬均無更動、美對英跌〇六二五、對法降一二五、對滬未更、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開賣價、英匯八辦士二八一二五、美匯十八元一八七五、較之前收均平、開後洋行結款雖繁、但因港電續來吐售、且外銀行供意亦濃、致乏變化、洋行結進港電麥加利某行英匯八辦士二八一二五、滙豐掛牌揭曉勿動、及白銀平衡稅揭曉續降半分、計徵百分之四·五〇、此後洋行又購結華比某行美匯十六元一八七五、繼之華行互做美匯十六元一五六二五、爲狀略軟、故近午時、錢兌業忽力塞港匯、故形勢趨鬆、賣予洋行港匯由五十五元三七五、長至半元、迨午收銀行賣價、英匯八辦士二八一二五、美匯十六元一五六二五、</p>
<p>後市頗形沉寂、價亦甚鮮變化、祗外行荷蘭與洋行相繼結進滙豐華比英匯八辦士二八一二五、兼又購結某行美匯十六元一五六二五、後華行互做港匯五十五元半、爲狀甚平、迨晚收銀行賣價英匯八辦士二八一二五、美匯十六元一五六二五、結果較之前收、英平美緊〇三一二五、港匯則續長二五、茲將一天做開交易錄後、</p>

<h3>春煤何爲而漲</h3>
<p>— 培本</p>
<p>花香人媚、春回大地、在往年呢、媒市到了春令、紅盤一開、交易漸清、貨價也回鬆了、不料今年、時值非常、新正以來、烟白煤塊、交易雖未見旺盛、而貨價卻冉冉上昇、有漲無跌、高起兩三元盤子、這種情形、不但外行的如蒙鼓中、就是同業中亦以爲事出意外、莫測高深、</p>
<p>可是種因還在去年秋間、本埠各煤行工廠、鑒於國產煤礦、交通不便、來源受阻、英商開平煤礦、雖有大量出產、但出於某方特殊勢力之下、來貨不繼、難以依靠、預料下冬煤斤、勢將缺乏、非借助洋煤不可、故紛紛向外洋印度澳洲等處、大批定購、各洋行以有利可圖、先後設立「煤炭部」、代客預定、四處兜售、於是乎、不論外行同業、以爲生財有道、奇貨可居、爭先恐後、唯虞不及、以致去冬進口額打破空前紀錄、數月間洋煤輸入達二十萬餘噸、同時、開平煤也有大批湧到、供給用戶、結果呢、是貨多銷衰、推動不易、而陰曆年底、卽待結束、於是一般銀根較緊者、不得不忍痛削價、急求脫出、故除了一般捷足先登者、因成本較輕、尚能稍獲蠅利、其餘均因匯兌緊縮、水腳飛漲、大多虧本、本埠某煤行因定澳洲煤、損折竟達十餘萬、大上大落、槪可想見、於是、各煤行遭此打擊、賠本貼息、均引起前車之鑒、對於外洋定煤、咸感消極、故近月來到貨稀少、實基於斯、</p>
<p>直待新春開盤、雖因烟煤存積漸稀、供不敷求、但銷數不旺、尚守穩勢、自最近因開平暗俏、售品處發客、加起四元盤子、因之其他各貨、一致提高、呈現畸形之漲價、至於火爐白煤、時屆春天、本已落令、但因邇來到源不廣、加之同業手中、均有未出棧單、故目前尚呈堅硬、一俟大批湧到、盤價即將回鬆、自可預卜也、</p>
<h3>證券　證券抬不起頭　遠東股票亦如是　都爲了歐局險惡</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日情形已有抬頭不起之象、因前日抬價過高、致起回旋、檯面形式似頗軟弱、一般人對於浙江情勢惡劣、市況乃現恍惚、昨日經過、市價初高後低、午後則爲低而後高、結果則全部行市絲毫未有上落、買賣雙方之陣綫、則信豐永始終買進、德孚天生同德仁昌等號亦有進胃、賣方則大豐及同康號　日多頭出籠、餘則午前衛四號及二十號以及聯和號均有賣出、午後則中一及五號亦有出脫、故市價幾次抬拉終未能高起、收盤時多方雖欲拉抬、但已爲羣空所包圍、故樂觀成份又居少數、結果行市與前日完全相同、絕無漲跌之可言、亦云巧矣、成交總數約計六七十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>

<p>股票交易、成交華商電氣八十餘股、價爲五元四角、正在議價、大約市價又略趨高云、</p>
<p>倫敦中國外幣債券本月二十二日（星期三）掛牌行市、尚見平定、僅廣九鐵路公債繼跌版本鎊、價爲二十鎊、其餘均無變動、英倫實貨供給、計英金善後公債俄發有印債票二十鎊、售價四十六鎊半、又湖廣鐵路公債德發有印票二十鎊、售價二十鎊半、照市抬二鎊半、</p>
<p>倫敦英商遠東各公司股票本月二十二日（星期三）掛牌行市、因歐局復緊、又見跌落、麥加利銀行股微跌二先令六便士、價爲八鎊十先令、滙豐銀行英倫註册股跌落一鎊半、香港註册股跌落半鎊、市價均爲八十三鎊半、開平煤礦股跌落九便士、價爲十六先令九便士、餘無變動、</p>
<h3>糖市　粗砂白成交寥寥</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢平軟、交易寥寥、公會劃盤、二四粗砂白轉口貨十六元五角七分半、祗成交一百包、現貨及太古糖均呌原價、未成交、國糖略有開出惠州白八十餘包、價廿三元一角、普通黃崗青三四十包、十四元九角、綿赤數十包、十五元二三角、</p>
<p>昨由香港運來糖七百二十包、又自汕頭來五百包、</p>
<h3>海味　溫開洋去路不弱　汕金鈎久無到貨</h3>
<p>溫州開洋、近來本街去路不弱、而津幫又復動辦、趨勢堅俏、昨日號盤開出爲六十一元五角、比前漲起四元、</p>
<p>汕頭金鈎尾、久無到貨、查此間底積已稀、且身份亦乾、刻市挺進、五碼其價爲九十二元、</p>
<h3>藥材　薏米來源不繼　都爲運輸困難</h3>
<p>薏米（即米仁）產自江北、近以該區不靖、運輸困難、致來源斷絕、乃目前已入銷令、而行貨存積又復單薄、查前市每担售五十元、今日有高呌六十元者、勢頗堅挺、</p>
<h3>紗花　銀行塌貨出籠　雙馬紗挫跌二元餘　津幫採購粗紗尚暢</h3>
<p>上日大跌之紗市、昨因浙東局勢和緩、人心較爲安定、市面轉趨回蘇之象、溫州幫對於四二支雙股綫復來辦貨、滬甬航運照常通行、不過納胃殊淺、於是買方又復活動、但華南方面需要較滯、買去甚少、惟北方津幫採辦粗紗頗暢、人心帶挺一步、但囤戶大陸銀行在四百元外購進之二十支雙馬紗約有數千包之鉅、監獄環境不良、業已開始斬結、市盤因之昂中帶軟、午後開盤長泰代大陸銀行復來出檔、據說有四百餘包、做開幾十包、價僅爲三百八十六元至六元半、比前市要跌二元、一元七角半至二元二角半、</p>
<p>現紗情形、晨初開盤、因寗波方面仍極穩定、滬甬航綫並未阻斷、海口雖經砲轟、並無妨礙、人心重振、市氣虛風消釋、開價加五角、二十支雙馬現紗價爲三百八十七元、同行成交幾十包、不過客需勿動、繼以買戶活躍、步步做高、最後二十支雙馬紗價爲三百八十八元二角、棧單亦做至七元、午後開盤市氣忽然轉變、大陸銀行突來出籠、約有數百包、售價跌二元、然吃客不多、一般掮客羣爭、形狀紊亂、大都胡調性質、始成交幾十包、價爲三百八十六元、少頃做到六元半、除此批交易外、其他絕無生意、同業均呆望而不動手、查全日各幫買去統計一千九百零五包、行情大致與上日相仿、惟三二支天女跌五元、廠方由新裕廠開出十支雙地球六十包、價爲二百九十二元、今日出口棉紗有一千一百十件運汕頭、九十件運香港、茲將各幫口買去之數量列左、</p>
<p>同行一、〇八〇　寗波　五　溫州三〇</p>
<p>內地　八〇　雲南一五五　香港　五</p>
<p>（天津）五三五　江西　五</p>
<p>厦門　五　統計一·九　五</p>
<p>日紗市情依然平淡無奇、稍帶軟化之象、因實需不旺、惟一般大戶仍在多頭地位也、二十支水月現貨價爲三百三十九元至四十元、二十支藍鳳現紗價爲三百三十元至二十九元、與上日無甚進出、</p>
<h3>印棉未能尅日到滬　美棉交易轉呈活躍</h3>
<p>火機高峯到七十二元二角</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市頗感疲乏、華盛頓方面對於存棉之處置、仍無確切消息、昨日因華爾街之拋出及多頭了結、又跌六七磅音、印度連同預測跌半羅比餘、埃及跌二十餘磅音、今晨電訊歐洲形勢轉定、預測今日海外棉市或有一致回好之可能也、昨日匯兌較鬆、折合法幣、棉價俱跌、計美棉及印棉每担跌六角、印棉跌三角、埃及棉跌一元二角、</p>
<p>滬市外棉交易、今日又轉靜寂、良以紗價未能轉好故也、印棉因水腳奇少、運貨困難、各廠前訂之貨、均未能尅日運到、故日來對於印棉殊少問津、然美棉交易轉呈活躍之狀、惟因貸款棉之未能即日放出、購棉殊不能隨意採辦、故交易數額未見龐大、昨日祗有鴻章進美棉五百包、當時言明、此棉需於五月中旬抵滬、未悉屆時能運抵上海否、茲將昨日外棉價格分錄於後、</p>
<p>原料　類別　送廠連稅</p>

<p>本棉生意略形起色、成交較旺、但筆數雖繁、然查核其擔腳殊弱也、實以價格太高、廠方買胃未健、購貨者、實無辦法、採取其顏色白亮、攙和印棉之需用也、近以外棉價格下降、中外各廠目標移注在印美棉花上、着手進行、昨火機花又現新高峯、爲七十二元二角、再漲二角半、其餘價格與上日無甚軒輊、浙棉到二千八百包、蘇北通州花僅抵滬六十包、茲將現棉成交之額量並市盤列左</p>

<h3>糧食　麵粉競銷　本街批價亦低五分</h3>
<p>南洋客盤仍見參差</p>
<p>本麥買賣不易接近</p>
<p>粉市現貨、續趨不振、查本街方面、因客盤降低後、亦擬減低結價、廠方乃自動修削五分、以期競銷、故昨日起、本街批價改爲四元六角、至客幫售價、則因推銷華北起見、特別暗盤犧牲、槪非正式市面、雖業中人亦不能詳悉其底蘊、昨據廠方消息、連日粉價已無形中帶混亂狀態、聞昨日本街零批交易約近萬包、二號粉售價爲四元六角、而南洋幫尚有四元六角五分之價者、市面參差、可見一斑、在此洋粉傾銷聲中、確非競爭、不足推銷、蓋現期洋粉本街交易、已迭見開展、零躉均有成交、期貨四元三四角、現貨四元六角左右、聞建源公司拋開花旗粉路貨五千包、價四元三角二分、該貨於下星期初即可運到、遠期洋粉暫乏成交、今日有粉五百包運汕頭、</p>
<p>麥市交易、亦在停頓中、惟近日零星小票、略有抵埠、如蘇崑一帶及江北等處、偶有數十包至二三百包運到、執貨者以產價高昂、一味扳持、而廠方吃盤、約六元八角、貨方喊價竟達七元三四角、致雙方不易接近、市面沉寂如故、</p>
<h3>粳米後市稍活　洋客秈俱小角許</h3>
<p>杜米來源、河下共到七號、車運包子三四千包、早市人心尚懈、本街店胃鮮有進去、市況續疲、厚薄粳價小去一二角、晚市囤戶稍有動辦、漸見活絡、遂呈平定之象、杜洋尖埠尖亦貶角許、變元因有洋糯應市、人心浮殊、都抱少進主義、市面亦落二角左右、但聞洋糯抵埠祗三百餘包、是殆人心激蕩所致耳、陰元本屬少貨、故能立定、</p>
<p>客秈昨有行囤續脫、晨間開價已被抑低二角、旋有新囤與本街零戶趁小收買、市面始得由疲轉定、但行情終見較小角外、南京頂秈開十三元、納胃尚懈、大市南京蕪秈僅開十二元七八角不等、統市成交數亦減至二千四五百包、</p>
<p>洋米西貢一號仍祗零星交易、惟十七元　角之價、已受本客步落所影響、昨貨之討價十七元一角、而進戶祗還十七元云、</p>
<h3>油餅　生豆油　少振作氣象</h3>
<p>豆油市況、雖因連市堅穩、但本市人心尚少振作、行情欲升反跌、出於本月份大連油到頭約計一萬七八千桶、故塲面上活動籌碼寬舒、且銷額亦稀、致瀉勢　衰、昨計成交連歧油五十件、價二十元原盤、豐年油四月份一百桶、三十一元五角、現大連油二百桶、三十二元零五分至三十一元八角、三四天成交二二百桶、三十一元九角半、三月下三百桶、三十一元八角九角、四月份六百桶、三十一元七角半及九角、花生油已由天津運抵三千餘聽、人心雖定、但市價仍無重大影響、昨計做開膠州油十件、二十九元三角、比前市跌二角、聽裝油成交青島油五十聽、三十八元八角、天津油四百聽、三十八元、</p>
<p>昨由天津運來豆子四千二百七十包、又豆子二百包運汕頭、又一百九十包運香港、</p>
<h3>疋頭　國布多銷粵幫去　天津竟以日貨爲多</h3>
<p>國布客幫銷路、昨以粵幫最爲生色、本街門市生意銷況極佳、浙東形勢仍緊張、各方深具戒心、購胃銳減、昨溫甬幫仍裝出細布粗布府綢漂布洋紗等貨三百餘件、粵幫採辦飛美人·美人魚·爵祿·新生路各牌色布色斜二百餘箱、條素府綢漂布條漂布等貨近百箱、白貨粗布細布細斜二百餘包、本街染廠進色斜坯布二百餘件、而府綢條子漂布坯布、亦各有躉頭成交、各貨市盤仍趨堅定、色斜及紗素府綢坯布、市上現貨頗見匱乏、春夏令貨、本街門市交易突旺、中上檔漂布條素府綢最爲熱門、各漂煉廠工作緊張、出品緩慢、現貨軋缺、坯布擱置殊豐、</p>
<p>東布白貨、因津幫續辦細布細斜五六百件、本街染色斜紋去胃亦佳、連細布成交七百餘件、故售盤堅定、龍頭細斜、且以現貨緊俏、提升每疋一角、售開爲十一元九角、東棉洋行繼續收進藍雙魚細布五幅細斜二百餘包、市勢益挺、</p>
<p>進出口、廿三日天津運來疋頭七十六件、運往寗波疋頭七百三十五件、廿四日運往香港疋頭三百七十五件、運往汕頭三百十五件、</p>
<h3>絲茶　滬絲漸感棘手</h3>
<p>昨日海外絲市、漲跌互見、橫濱現貨跌二〇元、遠期跌二十二元、里昂日絲上海絲各漲一法郎、紐約日絲八三及七五勻度各漲一分、但交易所近期、祗開原盤、遠期則下跌三分、又粗條紋絲則下降五分續許、</p>
<p>上海絲市、依然清淡、洋行吃價距達五〇元之上、用門則無心進出、蓋邇來因外絲市價漲跌倐忽、本埠人心不無動搖、況橫濱又傳出日圓貶值之可能、及本埠今春收　問題尚無可靠之辦法、是以絲市愈陷靜境、</p>
<p>今日有絲頭三十一件、運往意國、昨日由寗波運來茶葉二十八件、</p>
<h3>南北貨　杏仁　行盤高翔</h3>
<p>甜杏仁、亦爲某方統制關係、申市轉緊、且到存俱薄、尤足助長漲風、昨行盤如白玉扁已達二百元、亦有呌二百餘元者、龍王扁售一百七十元至一百六十元、苦杏仁漲勢稍殺、蓋爲升度過驟所致、</p>
<p>前日自威海衛運來升仁九百包</p>
<h3>百合片現貨少</h3>
<p>百合片近以港幫需辦孔亟、而此間現貨軋缺、致市勢步緊、如前售二十一二元之貨、刻有客貨數十件、已高呌二十八元（現鈔）、似猶未肯完全脫手、查產區底積總額不過三百件、且目前暫難運滬、故尚看續昂、</p>
<h3>紙張　錫箔減低售盤</h3>
<p>錫箔自農曆新年以來、消化已淡、而滬存旣充、產地又復一再搬運來申、市面早難支持、惟在箔商堅撐之下、售價尚無猛落、近被紹幫產商在滬貶值推銷、原　勢難維持、日前箔商因掃墓節將近、爲求本外埠暢銷起見、隨將零整售價、一律削減、</p>
<p>前日由寗波運來土紙五千五百件、</p>
<h3>煤炭　溫炭存底充盈</h3>
<p>本市燃料不虞匱乏</p>
<p>溫炭一週以來、大批湧到、達三萬餘擔、致推銷爲難盤價連日猛挫、交易竟告停滯、惟自浙東形勢轉緊、市勢突俏、升起一兩角碼子、計開大簍青炭每擔四元五角、竹炭三元二角、聞同業成交頗旺、但因底貨充溢、本市燃料、不虞缺乏、</p>
<h3>進出口　進口貨姚花占多</h3>
<p>昨日進口貨物、計有由汕頭運來窰貨六千七百八十件、又有土紙七千八百件、係由寗波來滬、</p>
<p>今日又由寗波裝來姚花一萬零六百餘件、棉紗二百件、又烟葉四十餘件、土紙一千二百五十件、裝意輪今晨即可進口、</p>

<h3>偷渡富春江日軍即將全部殲滅</h3>
<p>日軍目的在威脅南昌</p>
<p>登陸後卽遭駐軍痛擊</p>
<p>餘姚縣長電蕭紹安謐</p>
<p>浙東形勢緊張之後、偷渡富春江日軍將殲滅、日艦擾亂沿海各地雖有所企圖、中國軍事當局已調派大軍增防、蕭紹甬溫電告地方安謐、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>偷渡日軍行將殲滅</p>
<p>小股日軍偷渡富春江對岸、登陸後、已遭駐軍猛烈痛擊、登陸日軍行將完全殲滅、聞日軍之偷渡富春江、企圖佔據浙贛鐵路之臨浦車站、再沿鐵路綫進窺諸暨金華、登陸之日軍約一百餘名、在江岸沙灘上即爲大隊駐軍、及自衛團痛擊、第十集團軍劉總司令、已派大軍馳往增防、日軍企圖決難得逞、</p>
<p>蕭紹等處電告安謐</p>
<p>紹興旅滬七縣同鄉會、昨日上午十二時、接餘姚縣長二十二日下午十二時四十分拍出之電云、敬電悉、蕭紹安謐、縣長林養叩」、同時航商昨接溫州寗波之電告、均謂浙東寗波溫州安謐如常、新聲社記者昨向紹興旅滬同鄉會探悉、蕭山縣屬之聞家堰、雖日軍一再企圖偷渡登陸、進攻浙東、均遭駐軍擊退、浙東各縣、均有長途電話通達、如果聞家堰形勢緊張、則餘姚縣長決不致電告安謐、</p>
<p>鎭海要塞安然無恙</p>
<p>棠魯輪於前日由甬抵滬、據某外人旅客談、日艦一艘、運輸艦一艘、驅逐艦三艘、現集中於鎭海口外之瀝港洋面、於星期一下午、突向鎭海要塞發砲轟擊、曾有多彈落要塞附近、守軍方面、亦發砲予以還擊、惟日艦發砲、漫無目的、要塞安然無恙、現寗波防守司令已命令疏散居民、當該輪駛經定海時、見有日艦多艘遊弋該處、</p>
<p>浙東軍團約百萬人</p>
<p>又談浙東金華爲重要之軍事根據地、日軍對浙東方面直接有所行動、即間接威脅南昌、蓋日軍久懷向南昌進攻、然迄今未有若何進展、而所付代價、已不可勝計、如進攻南昌、必須先攻浙東、現華軍在浙東北沿岸一帶、亦有嚴密防衛、軍隊人數、亦增至五十萬人、以及另外組織戰事便衣隊以上、總共約有一百萬人、防務甚爲鞏固、治安可無問題、</p>
<p>甬商存貨着手疏散</p>
<p>寗波防守司令對於寗波方面海岸交通、因商業上極占重要、現如予完全封鎖、影響殊鉅、萬一必要、對水面封鎖、仍可隨時立即施行、並悉溫州寗波商會當局、業已發出命令、通知各商人、所有存在上述地點之貨物、應即運往內地、以爲戰事之非常準備、外國航商之船隻、決照常派輪行駛、</p>
<p>外商繼續浙東航運</p>
<p>昨向各外商輪船公司探悉、英·美·德·葡·等航商、決定在浙東派輪照常行駛、今由滬裝往浙東之貨物、雖受時局影響而銳減、但來貨極擁擠、昨日由溫抵滬之輪船、爲華美公司之棠魯輪、定明日再行駛溫、昨日由滬駛寗波者、爲華美公司之棠賽輪、至於正德公司之山泰輪、昨已決定改今日下午四時駛甬、明日由滬駛溫者、爲海福·海龍·兩輪、</p>
<h3>本市各界自動組織　國民精神總動員會</h3>

<h3>日軍進攻魯匯遭阻截　閘港再度被焚</h3>
<p>全鎭恢復舊觀已非易事</p>
<p>昨晨日軍又往把守碼頭</p>
<p>浦東南匯縣屬沿浦邊只閘港鎭、前日被日軍登陸、縱火焚燒、亘數小時、全鎭化爲灰燼、二次遭受</p>
<p>空前浩刦</p>
<p>難民男女老幼千餘人、無家可歸、流亡四鄉、淒慘萬狀、按該鎭曾於去歲遭日艦大砲之一炬、經若干時候、災民陸續來歸、改搭草房、迄今亦有二百餘間、</p>
<p>恢復舊觀</p>
<p>且該鎭係南匯水道出入唯一沿浦要口、遂成畸形發達狀態、經此大火、全鎭夷成平地、再欲回復往日繁盛、已非易事、先是前日（二十二日）上海十時、由閔行方面駛來日汽艇七艘、滿載日兵六七十名、由浦中小型</p>
<p>兵艦掩護</p>
<p>強制登陸、先將浦邊所泊空米船三十餘艘扣封、不准駛開、並將碼頭上正當平民三人逮捕、繼即向鎭上搜索、但無遊擊隊行踪、在圖東進、</p>
<p>搜索魯匯</p>
<p>鎭、（按魯匯爲日兵所佔、因被遊擊隊困擾、已退回新塲、故魯匯已經克復、）詎日軍離閘港鎭、一三里、即被遊擊隊范根才部攔截迎擊、展開激戰、達一小時許、日軍受重創敗退回鎭是時鎭民已</p>
<p>逃亡一空</p>
<p>偶有年老者、亦寥寥無幾日軍乃分投縱火、全鎭草房、霎時被大火籠罩、濃煙高沖空際、異常慘烈、孤島中之高樓上、亦能隱約望見、嗣遊擊隊迫近、日兵始於午後一時、退登汽艇逸去、被捕三人、亦被帶走、生死不明、</p>
<p>該鎭火焰</p>
<p>焚燒至前日傍晚、始行熄滅、遊擊隊衝至鎭上、因市房全燬、無掩蔽物可守、仍退駐鄉間、至昨日（二十三）清晨、日軍十餘名、又乘汽艇由兵艦掩護上岸、在閘港浦邊碼頭上把守、浦中則泊有</p>
<p>小型兵艦</p>
<p>四艘、載有日兵之汽艇十餘艘、往來閘港·杜家行·王家渡·新龍華·一帶浦面、隨路搜查民船、形勢仍頗嚴重、惟被扣封之空米船三十餘艘、已於昨晨釋放、</p>

<h3>日方在南市　續運銅鐵</h3>

<p>收復羅店</p>
<p>寶山遊擊隊總指揮、前晚（廿二日）率隊由×××出發、包抄日軍、因時值深夜、且該地日軍、係新從杭州方面調來之水　　備隊、不明地理、驚慌失措、聞　亂竄、當被樊部殲滅半數以上、生擒達十餘名之多、　奪　輕重彈藥甚夥、樊於獲勝後、除酌留一部份勇士鎮守羅店外、仍率隊退回原處、</p>

<h3>滬工人　生活指數</h3>
<p>房租漲勢最勁</p>
<p>食物雜項較次</p>

<p>食品大部上漲</p>
<p>本月米價回漲、粳米較上月漲半元以上、秈米及糯米漲一元左右、時值國歷年初、廢歷年底、需要較殷、且氣候轉寒、來貨見稀、又以稅捐過重、並日方統制遊擊區米產、大批裝運出口、米價因之踊貴、麵粉存底不充、原料缺乏、市盤喊高、豬牛大批到滬、肉價稍見回跌、雞以廢歷年終將屆、需要較殷、售價日趨上游、豆油到稀銷活、價亦回漲、食鹽價格統制之後、呈高步之勢、本類指數、爲一二二、六〇、較上月升百分之三、二八、</p>
<p>房租繼續上升</p>
<p>房租一項、雖有變動、惟一年之中、鮮有一再增減者、故其變動、遠不如物價上下之頻繁、房租調查、向例每年舉辦一次、惟自二十六年八月戰起、滬市房租、上漲至速且鉅、故改爲年查二次、本年第一次、在一月舉行、平房較二十七年下半年又漲百分之五、八六、東洋式樓房漲百分之五、一九、石庫門樓房漲百分之〇、四一、本月指數爲三一五、〇八、較上月升百分之四·四八、</p>
<p>水電房捐均加</p>
<p>戰事初起、滬上居民、紛紛離滬埠者、日以萬計、其中以富有者及中下階級爲多、蓋工人階級、與各方關係甚多、且傢具不多、茍有川資、匆匆即行、無所用其躊躇、迨滬戰告終、又復紛紛歸來、或先分庽親朋家中、四出覓屋、然租界房屋有限、房價已騰貴矣、又查工人居處、時有異動、依據本月調查、遷移家庭、計佔所查價數百分之二十、際此內地人民不斷來滬之時、屋少人多、供不應去、在勢房租有增無減、何處能覓廉價居處、普通里坊中三層樓房一幢、價數有多至十家以上、人數在五十左右者、頂費往往須一二千元之鉅、然在房客、猶只求有屋、不問租費頂費、乘機抬價、勢所必然、至於工人、大半向二房東三房東租屋、負擔尤重、設大房東加租、二三房東非但不起而反對、反表歡迎、蓋彼有所籍口、鉅額增加、又如水電房捐、俱各增收、亦爲籍口加租之理由、然房價所增、實遠過於水電房捐增收之數、</p>
<p>衣着燃料平平</p>
<p>粗布細布漂布、市盤堅挺、條格布·花標布·綫呢·絨布及襪、售價下降、本類各品、跌多於漲、指數下降百分之二、五二、至於燃料各品中、劈柴之消費最殷、本月到貨稀少、門市售價略昂、溫州炭來源仍稀、價趨上升、煤球價稍挫落、指數盤旋於二三五左右、惟雜項售價與上月相仿、無甚榮辱、黃酒價格上漲較巨、本月指數爲一七〇、一六、較上月高百分之一、五三、</p>

<p>國醫與食養痧子特刊小兒「發痧子」之症情變化及食養程序  陳存仁　　入春以來，小兒痧疹盛行，近時上海住屋缺少，每一小宅，恒有數十老幼聚居，以致此症傳染甚速，邇來天時失常，寒熱不時，痧疹病勢，尤易蔓延，本刋近得痧疹稿件極多，特行選錄數篇，編爲「痧子特刋」，此稿爲余舊稿改作，一併刋出。　　痧子將發未發時期　　小兒發熱三五日不退，眼淚瀅瀅，泛泛欲噁，時作咳嗽，疲倦無神，此時易發痧子，如在口內兩旁頰肉處見淡紅帶微微白色晶點者，卽係發痧子之確實預兆，二三日內必見痧點。此時小兒卽宜素食，食物愈少愈好，略吃飯滯粥湯已可，至多吃少許素菜，如黃芽菜白菜豆腐之類，糖食冷食均忌。　　痧疹將發未發製劑，常以開水代飲，易發者極簡單輕快，不易者雖服藥得宜，亦未最煩惱最困難時期，如飲冷品或涼性食物，易使症勢惡化。　　痧子發透時期　　痧疹見點之際，最好之飲料，爲荸薺煎湯，以湯充茶，早夕授飲，利小便，凈血毒，化痰透疹，最最佳妙，此時往往不欲進食，小菜固不必備，情形良好者，痧點旺盛，神色自若，欲進食時，仍以薄粥爲宜，佐膳小菜，限定海蜇皮荸薺片二種，海蜇雖硬，入口遇胃中鹼液，立卽消化，其功能化痰，荸薺則能化痰消食。　　痧子透齊之後　　痧疹以發至鼻部足部滿佈爲「透齊」，痧子在未透齊之前，所吃皆透散發熱之藥，室中氣候，求其溫暖，唯一大患，卽恐遇冷退回，但一到「透齊」之後，則悉反其常，吃藥漸趨清理，冷性食品，在所不忌，而且透齊之後，須進涼性飲料，其次序如左：　　痧疹透齊第一日，仍以荸薺煮茶，或用新鮮荸薺梗（藥店有曝乾出售，名爲通天草，約銅元數枚可購。）煎水亦好：第二日則用荸薺與蘆根二兩同煎飲：待至第三日起，荸薺十根，蘆根二兩，茅根二紮同煎飲湯。　　佐膳小菜：（一）清鹽拌豆腐，（二）拌豆腐衣，（三）拌平湖飯滯，（四）海蜇皮，四種輪流更換。　　此時吃粥爲限，可吃米燒粥，最初三天粥要薄，四天后加厚。牛乳亦不宜，麵包餅乾糖食均須少吃。　　水果有三種可吃，橘子開胃，生梨凈肺。紅皮甘蔗清痧毒，頗爲有益。　　痧疹之後，往往有痧毒，故宜多吃茅根茶及紅皮甘蔗露，（紅皮甘蔗係廣東產，皮紫色，肉白色，長約四五尺。）廣東竹節煎茶，（廣東雜貨店有售，）不妨吃十天至十五天左右。　　痧後癆之防止　　痧疹之後，肺部受熱逼灼，往往咳嗽，早晚不休，此時最宜留心，淡行人露琵琶葉露可吃，；另須延醫服藥，因而數小兒成爲痧後癆者，十人之七，皆痧毒入肺久咳傷肺故也。　　「痧後癆」其餘十中之三，爲痧後胃火旺盛，痧子退後，異常要吃，不吃卽吵，肝火亦盛，動卽哭鬧，父母因小兒病后，往往隨兒之意，聽其多吃，其實此時爲痧後癆開端，往往愈吃愈瘦，皮乾光枯黃，吵鬧不休，見物要吃，屢吃不易，約過二十天後，有時小便，如米疳水，痧癆卽成，故遇此現象，當訪醫服藥，始能防患于未然，一面吃紅皮甘蔗露，以清痧毒，並吃炒焦使君子。（藥店出售，去壳，炒熟，如花生米，每日吃七八粒，以防疳積生蟲。）痧子之防護  丁濟華　　兒科中最普遍之病症，要算痧痘兩科，痘症自種牛痘法發明後，已屬少見，惟痧子一症，尚無法防杜。近來上海居民突增，又逢痧疹流行，難民所中小兒，傳染殆遍。因痧子而傷亡者，較承平時亦增數倍。痧子本屬常事，來勢雖有順有逆，只要處理得當，絕少危害，其所以不能救治者，大都不明防護之故。茲將痧子之症狀及防護方法分述如下：　　小兒出痧子未見點時，極似輕微之傷風症，如食慾不振，手足時冷時熱，遊戲無勁，睡後間有寒熱，過七八日，病設不退，寒熱反見增高，兩眼淚水瀅瀅，咳嗽嘔吐，或者下痢，此時須檢查其口頰內粘膜，及下臼齒部有無斑點：如有紅點，中有珠形白色圓點者，即爲發痧子之的症。　　痧子見點時，先見於兩耳，繼則現於面部，胸際，以及四肢，約三日佈齊。初見之點，點形甚小，佈齊後，則星羅棋佈，大小不一，但痧點雖不整齊，在不整齊中恒有健全之皮膚，若痧點糢糢糊糊，望之但見紅光一片者此非正痧，急須延醫診視，痧點佈齊後，三日則回，鮮紅之點，漸變爲火熖色，各種病象，亦相繼而退，此乃最順痧點。設痧點透而不齊，面部過少，寒熱似退非退，咳嗽煩悶，大便溏泄不止，此即爲逆痧，須加倍當心，以期轉逆爲順。　　第一，寒暖要當心。痧子喜溫而惡寒，得溫則透，受寒則陷。例如出痧時，面部感受風冷，面部即不透出，手足露風亦然；若全身受寒，則痧子欲透不能，於是氣急，鼻煽，手足抽搐，內陷之險立至。故痧子見點後，須睡有帳簾之床，衣着被褥務求溫暖，待痧點透齊回盡後，方可露風。但所謂溫暖，亦有限度，不能過熱，若將病孩重重後覆，熱水袋湯婆子四面圍繞，病孩得熱，痧點固易透出，設汗出過多，陽氣外泄，痧後　於復元，往往釀成痧癆。再若病孩變熱，後汗不出，渾身　熱，驚風之禍頃刻而現。普通驚風，尚能救治，痧子而見驚風，溫藥旣不可用，涼藥又不可施，誠最爲棘手矣。　　第二，飲食皆當心。痧子忌葷油，人人皆知，違者於病時固屬不利，且病后必須口臭。至於素食亦要留神，普通病症，大都不禁醬瓜大豆蔡等物，而痧症則不能入腹；因痧症十九兼患咳嗽，多食　品，肺中風熱不能透達，日後恐成慢性肺病，故在出痧期中，最好吃淡粥。病孩怕吃淡粥，稍加糖屑亦可。惟不能多，多則恐寒熱增高。　　第三，不可通大便。痧子初發時，形如傷風，已如上述，病家不察，往往爲普通風寒食積，不問情由，先用瀉藥一瀉；把穩者則用皮硝一消，以豈知痧子宜透不宜下，一瀉之後，病勢雖不見增加，痧子不能透出難免多所遷延矣。若已見痧點，仍用瀉藥，病孩體弱者痧子即易隱沒，手指發冷，變成慢驚。故病家之稍具醫藥常識者，對此亦須愼重將事焉　　第四，普通單方之應用。痧子所用之單方如茅根湯，荸薺湯，芫荽菜，皆簡而易用，用之得當，亦等於湯藥。茲略爲說明之：痧子透出甚順，但寒熱高，口渴煩躁者，可用茅根二札，去心煎湯飲之。痧子透出後，咳嗽頗劇，大便閉結者，可用連皮荸薺十餘枚，煎湯飲之，荸薺亦可吃。若大便溏薄者不能服。痧子相繼透出，或有不透之處，則用芫荽菜五六兩，置於面盆內，以滾水沖之，浸五分鐘後，用毛巾置於芫荽菜湯內，取出絞乾，乘熱按於不透之處，稍冷即換，但亦不能過熱，恐燙傷病孩皮膚；而芫荽菜亦不能置於爐上煎熬，一經煎熬，則藥性消失矣。　　以上數則雖似十分淺易，然於痧子一症，皆極有關係，凡有小兒患痧症者，能照此方法防護，定可逆者化順，順者益安也。小兒痧子盛行　飲食最宜注意（下）  尤學周　　痧子自初發以致透齊，其消化力受痧毒之影響，漸次減削，故胃口亦漸劣，甚至不欲進食；待痧子回後，食慾自起，故無用憂懼，更不必強爲加餐。其能食者，胃口已大減，祗宜以薄粥與服，或用荳腐漿及稀薄之藕粉，以免傷及胃腸。　　痧子透齊以後，病兒頗形衰頹，有終日鼾臥而不醒者，不可頻頻呼喚，以驚醒之！蓋能鼾臥者，可得充分之休養，體力增強，康健易於恢復。亦不必固守成例，於進食時間，因服食而喚醒之，強爲加餐，所收之效果，未必勝於鼾臥也。　　患者之熱度，與痧子之透發，背道而馳，痧子漸透，熱漸退，及透齊，熱亦消散。熱之與渴，則成爲正比例，微熱則微渴，大熱則大渴，如痧子透齊，尚作渴者，熱未退盡之證，可以茅根煎湯與服，或仍用荸薺湯服之。橘子汁溫服，旣可解渴，又可防止痧後發生牙疳便血等疾患，亦計之得者。　　痧子初起作咳，乃咽喉或氣管受其影響而發生，茍不劇烈亦不必調治，實際上亦無使之靜止不咳，待痧子透齊，炎證漸消，咳嗆可以自止。如透齊而咳不減，或口腔發炎而流涎水者，可使含鹽湯藕節，蓋食鹽有消炎解毒之功能，而藕節所含之鞣酸，又具收斂之作用，以之治療口腔咽喉之炎證，甚微微適宜。——如藕節不易得，可用清鹽橄欖代之，亦頗有效。　　痧子旣回，諸證亦隨之消滅，病孩之食慾，反見增進，對於飲食一項，更宜注意，蓋食慾雖增，消化力未必強大，飲食過多，反致戕賊其生機；故此時亦宜節其食量，且由薄粥漸進胃濃粥，吃飯及一切堅硬之食物，仍須嚴禁，待消化力恢復常態，此種禁令，始可解除。粥菜普通常用醬瓜大頭菜等，然宜吐去其渣，否則有碍消化，不弱於粥中拌以肉湯菜湯爲佳。　　疳積爲小兒之一種特異病症，肢瘦腹大，能食而不生肌肉，青筋綻露，啼聲如鴉，斷乳以後，最易發生，痧後亦多患之。皆因家長不知節約其飲食，任情恣意，致消化不良而轉成。如痧後小兒飲食無度，宜加以限制，以防引起泄瀉或轉成疳積。其已發生疳積狀態者，可用雞內金，白扁豆，炙蟾皮，枳實，檳榔等服之。　　病孩受痧毒之侵擾，其經過難安全，而體力則大見衰頹，痧回以後，可徐圖恢復其體力，然亦僅能用滋養方法，在日常飲食上注意，且不可驟用大補之品。日常飲食物之合於滋養條件者，如豆腐漿，牛乳，肉湯，雞汁等，滋養料旣豐富，又易消化，更便於置辦採用，實爲最佳之品。　　痧後落屑，皮膚作癢，以不潔之指甲掻之，往往傳染瘡疥等皮膚病；若早食魚腥蝦蟹，皮膚易於作癢。　魚蝦之類，不易消化，又易引起胃腸病，故宜少食，能禁止勿食尤佳。痧後攝護法  缶鳴　　痧子之患者，以小兒爲最多，其過程，自始至終，以十二日爲正常。病后由於體內之需要，食慾每較平時增加，不予相當節制，則有停滯積食之患，如胃口呆頓，脘腹飽滿，即其現象；宜予焦鍋巴湯飲之，有因停滯而患泄瀉者，則欲以焦查炭焦薏仁湯。　　痧子後常有餘毒未清，變症叢生，致如牙床出血，此爲走馬牙疳之初步；可急以馬奶之處，可以活蘆根煎濃汁飲之。此症如延而不治，則有落齒穿頰，危及生命之險，患者愼之。　　痧子後如大便旬餘未通者，此或大腸有熱，可多以蔬菜佐膳，或以蜂蜜一匙，加麻油數滴，開水沖飲；以得大便爲度。　　痧子後常有項頸結核，腫起疼痛，此即所謂痧毒，餘毒未盡，凝結而成。故初起時，應以海蜇皮荸薺同煎湯飲之，或可消散無形，若失此不治，則成膿破潰，殊費麻煩矣。食養識小錄青龍白虎湯  許錦濤　　橄欖能清內蘊之風火，蘿蔔可化外來之燥熱，喉症初起時，以此二物煎湯服之，即可收效。在喉症盛行之際，常人亦宜時服，庶幾臟腑清和，非惟喉症不起，即其他疾病亦不易感染矣。蕉根救走黃  宋明　　疔瘡走黃，本屬不治之症，但據武林已故名醫毛世洪先生遺方謂：如係誤食豬肉而致走黃者，可急取芭蕉根搗汁飲之，尚能挽救。</p>

<p>自由談浙東的戰事  茂烈　　這幾天，請諑紛紜，浙東一片乾淨土，似乎終究要不免沾染到腥羶了。浙東人民，不論是住在那裏或旅居在別地的，尤其是在上海的，當然要因之而皇皇不安，便是全國各地的人民，我想也一定很關心着吧。　　可是，我以爲不論浙東的前途有什麽變化，我們關心是應該的，不安却是不需要的。我希望浙東的同胞，都能鎮靜以處之，聽從我們當局的指揮，來積極從事抗戰的工作。　　當鄂中和蘇北的戰事初起時，似乎我們的敵人也大吹大擂，鬆動過人們的耳目。當時我就斷定他們似乎無所成就，不過是一些無聊舉動而已。現在，不是事實告訴我們，敵人除了略略佔有幾點或幾綫，聊爲點綴以外，其他便一無所得麼？不是不但一無所得，並且頗有所失麼？那末以此例彼，即使敵人果然要有事於浙東，其結果的貧乏，也是可想而知的。　　照我看，敵人現在開始騷擾浙東，不外乎下列兩個原因：一，和騷擾鄂中與蘇北一樣，並無全盤計劃，或巨大目的，不過向世界以及其國人告訴說，他們，尤其是軍閥，仍在進行戰事，並不停止攻擊，藉此來維持他們的威信，報銷他們的耗費。二，則與由南潯綫進攻南昌者，遙爲呼應，以收夾擊之效。第一個原因，當然毫無價值，不足介意，而第二個原因，按目前的情況看來，似乎也只是變相的第一個原因之列，那末幫助進攻南昌，還不是無聊的極致，簡直虛張聲勢而已！　　我說這話，並沒有一些僥倖之心，故意說敵人不會進攻浙東，來安慰浙東的同胞；我是誠意要說，即使敵人實行進攻，儘可處之泰然，敵人所得，充其量也不過如鄂中與蘇北一樣而已。我相信浙東同胞，素有臥薪嘗胆的遺風，將來即使受到意料中的痛苦，也會不以爲然，最後與敵人以致命的打擊。　　總之，記好，現在是全面抗戰，誰也不應存茍免的心思。敵人送上門來，正好，立刻就起來消滅他們！在宋莊  李喬　　——徐州突圍回憶記　　從禹王山撤退下來，到了宋莊，我們便在宋莊一連休息了兩天。　　宋莊離台兒莊約有三十餘里，離宿羊山車站不遠。這裏疏疏落落的又十多間北方人特有的高粱桿蓋的草屋，但房裏滿給從火綫上逃來的難民擁塞着。屋外那清幽平坦的地面上，給一株株高大的綠樹交織着，就像一個清涼無比的公園似的，我們夜裏裹着一床灰毡便睡在這個樹蔭下，睡着兩隻想睡而不忍睡的眼睛，望着那從樹隙裏透進來的月亮的清輝，心裏感到一種像在嚼着什麽甜蜜的糖似的詩意。　　天一亮，敵機三三兩兩的便飛來頭頂上盤旋着，牠能偵查得到什麽呢？有時，這些蠢笨的敵機，便盲目的在遠遠的一些村莊裏投下炸彈來，聽着那嗡嚨嗡嚨好像打雷似的聲音，我們不由得好笑了起來：　　「操你媽的，××的老百姓那裏想得到他們的血汗錢，是給這末騙了來炸在我們的田地上！——好，看你能有多少炸的？」　　砲聲不斷的遠遠的傳了來，好似一陣陣雷聲。天晴得像一片蔚藍的海水似的，田野裏的那一片綠油油的麥子，在溫暖的太陽光的撫摸下，靜靜的在躺着。有一兩個「知了」躱上樹梢上，拼命的在呌着，衝破了中午的寂靜。　　在禹王山上苦戰了二十多天，沒有得休息過的弟兄們，白天老愛伏在樹蔭下打着盹。鄉村裏是靜靜的，一個人也不見，就只有那刺目的強烈的陽光，寂寞地照在打麥塲上，麥子上，……　　嗡嚨！嗡嚨！一律排砲聲又響了起來。從樹蔭下忙爬了起來，向砲聲響處看了一看，前面依然是山，樹，村莊，田野，麥子，一點戰爭的情形也看不見。但在那一片碧綠的田野裏，黑鬱鬱的一大長串的人，像螞蟻似的正向着宋莊洶湧的流了過來………　　「老鄉，你們到那裏去？」望着走上前來，臉上籠着一臉的驚惶，趕着一匹馱着行李婦人孩子的驢車，頭上流滿了汗的男子，像看見了自家的什麽親戚似的，我們忍不住同情的在問。　　「不曉得！」那男子停住了驢車，淒苦的望着我們，似乎感到有些茫然。　　「不曉得，你們到那裏去呢？呵，——」　　我們對他們的那渺茫的不可知的前途嘆了一口氣，眼光剛轉到那無盡的後來的人身上，那男子便在那匹負着重累的瘦驢子身上加了一鞭，那驢子沒命的拖着車，飛起了一片黃灰，便向走遠了的人的後面趕去了。　　人，不斷的，狼狽的走了來，又向着東面的田野裏走了去。每個人都揹着一團僅有的財產——行李，有的揹背一細高粱桿，手裏牽着一個不肯向前走，老是那末吱吱的呌着的小豬。狗吐着舌頭留戀的跟着主人。十七八歲的大姑娘，用一些黑烟把一個健康的紅紅的臉抹得那末怪醜惡的，頭上包着一塊破布頭，身上穿着一件寬大的破舊衣服，看那樣子就好像有四五十歲似的。老頭子含着兩滴眼淚，蹣蹣跚跚的擠在人的洪流裏。兩隻嬌嫩的小腳已經走不得路了的孩子跟在背上負着重負的母親的後面，求救的嚎哭着；但誰能救他呢？　　望着這羣走不完的流離失所的同胞，雖然一個多月來的戰塲生活把心鍜鍊得那末堅硬的了，我這時也忍不住流下眼淚來！　　呵，誰使得我們這些同胞無家可歸呢？還能用什麽報答他呢？全中國人民，在血泊中站起來！  戴蒼奇必登  耿之　　開宗明義章第一：登者，登報也。　　天下事到了一「走」，本來已可「了之」，然而猶有登報這一會事焉，不能了，於是乎我再來談「必登」。　　謹按那些「必到」，「必言」與「必走者」，無非有一個「必登」在他的心裏作梗。早上起來，一打開報紙，翻到本埠新聞，某種集會紀事裏面，看見出席者某某某，某某某，諸大名人之中，有自己的尊姓大名在焉，心中快樂，自然有如登仙；或者再看見演說者與發表意見者之內，更有他的雅篆台甫，這一樂，又更上一層樓了；至於新聞記者末了將筆一掉，略謂某氏「因有要公，不及終會（或終席）而去，極爲可惜云云」，這所謂的某氏，有不距躍三百，曲踴三百，認爲「初出茅廬第一功」者，幾希！　　爲了有這種必登的心理作梗，於是惟恐其不登，或果然發覺其不登，就不免動動腦筋，另向辦法：「招待」新聞記者，在報上發表「來件」，諸如此類，就成了必有的點綴。至於自己編一種雜誌，或出版一本書，然後自己做成新聞，送登報紙，對人大吹特吹，將自己大捧特捧，其熱烈之情，頗像白濁醫生的廣告，如果包醫不靈，甘願雷殛火焚，天誅地滅，這樣的「必登」，更是「司空見慣渾閒事」，不足爲奇　　說到登廣告，果然就有直接去登廣告費，蓋廣告亦報紙也。今請言廣告之必登。　　登廣告自然最簡便，只要出得起廣告費，就可以要怎樣登便怎樣登，不像其他的登，還要其他的條件，或者甚至要求神拜佛，打躬作揖，向人陪着小心。　　登廣告亦有道焉，登得得法，就能收到牠的妙用，登得不得法，非徒無益，而又害之。現在我們當然應該談談有益的。　　在出版雜誌或書籍的廣告上，用輝煌大字，注出編者是誰，著者是誰，是最普通的廣告。有一位編某種週刋的先生曾對我說過，每星期爲某週刋登廣告一次，看見自己的名字閃耀在報紙上，實不勝其舒泰，蝕本費工夫，都是願意的。　　用名人介紹，要別人鳴謝，也是最普通的廣告。關於這一類，以書畫名家爲多，而醫卜星象之流，更會利用。　　不大普通的，則有這幾種：一，從事可登廣告的事業者，取名與大人物挨兄弟，例如「蔣介×」，「陳其×」，「宋子×」等；二，直接與某名人同姓名，並且同職業，例如開醫院，由得別人去纏不清，弄不明，以收魚目混珠之效；三，反其道而行之，聲明我與某風流事，或某不名譽事件的主角，雖同姓名，我並非其人，而措辭則不妨俏皮，稍示其與有榮焉；……　　廣告的宣傳，自然不及新聞的宣傳力來得大，所以能登新聞的，當然要登新聞，而廣告次之。然而慨夫報紙收入，全仗廣告而來，廣告的勢力，就足以左右新聞而有餘，所以善登者，如果袋裏的確麥克麥克，還是以先登廣告爲最要，有必登之心者，不可不知。　　「必登」到此，似乎已經可以結束了，然而仔細想想，却還漏去極重要的一項，不能不再添上幾筆，以成「蛇足」。　　大家都知道，蕭君伯納是一個大文豪，而他所以成名的原故，就是爲了他懂得另一種必登的訣巧。那不是別的，就是罵人而被人罵。罵人固好，被人罵尤好。人不來罵，則不妨故意招惹之；人來罵，當然更加系索敝賦，週旋到底。罵來罵去，不妨罵得刻毒，惡辣，刁鑽挖掐，其雅稱總是筆戰。一戰再戰，報上有名，書上有名，雜誌上有名，於是乎堂哉皇哉，萬古流名！　　「三代之上，惟恐好名；三代之下，惟恐不好名，」必登必登，無非名心爲累，庸何傷！守望  丁冬　　我守望，　　在哨岡；　　山風從四面吹來，　　拂槍口作異響。　　草叢內有蛇與松鼠在搏鬥，　　昆蟲也發出鳴聲的淒涼。　　然而這一些於我心有何怦悸，　　兩眼只是凝神地望着前方。　　兩眼直視凝神地望着前方，　　起伏的峯巒映在天邊，　　頭頂有明星在閃耀，　　背後有弟兄在跟隨；　　天光處有黑影在移動，　　我立即將子彈裝進槍膛。　　敵人在向我們偷襲，　　黑物一羣羣越過峯巒。　　近了，近了，　　這一羣貪婪的豺狼，　　我閃在樹叢的深處，　　守候着豺狼的前行。　　守候着豺狼的前行，　　「噝……」我殺死了敵人的尖兵。　　黑夜誰知道我們人數的多少，　　我乃向天空放一排槍。　　弟兄們聞槍聲趕上，　　一個個敵兵竄逐慌忙，　　經過了殊死的搏鬥，　　敵人一個也不曾越過哨岡。　　天明時我的兩手，我的衣服　　有鮮紅血跡斑斑；　　第二夜，　　我又守望，在哨岡！中篇小說烽火中  周燕　　十三　光榮的死　　蔡和豐回到了楓林鎮，把陳鎮長願意做內綫，裏應外合的收復合浦鎮，掃蕩×軍和獨眼李匪均的意思，對葉團長說了一遍。葉團長起初還不敢相信他，恐怕這是陳鎮長的一種詭計，想把他的軍隊誘到了合浦鎮去，一網打盡，好向×方獻工。可是蔡和豐一力擔保說，陳鎮長的出任僞「維持會」會長，確是出於被迫，他又把陳鎮長的女兒秀月，因爲不肯嫁×方的宣撫班長，上弔死去的事，告訴了葉團長，並且說：陳鎮長現在恨×方刺骨，決不會再有什麽三心兩意。　　葉團長聽說秀月上弔死了，心裏很覺難過。他還記得從前楊岳梁到他家來向葉老先生提親，以及自己用「匈奴未滅何以爲家」的話拒絕的事，覺得「我雖不殺伯仁，伯仁由我而死」，至少秀月的死，他自己應負一半責任，假使當初自己肯允婚，那麼今日一定不會發生這樣的悲劇。同時，他派出去打聽的人又回來報告說，陳鎮長正忙着在辦喜事，於是他也就相信陳鎮長的答應做內綫，確實出自眞誠的了。　　還有一件使葉團長相信陳鎮長的誠意的事，就是他從前在合浦鎮時所下令統制的船隻，當初因爲撤退得忽促，來不及令牠們全數退出，這時那些船戶們已都接到了陳鎮長的秘密通知，紛紛乘×方不備的當兒，離開了合浦鎮，先後搖到距楓林鎮不願的太湖畔停泊。船戶中的頭腦，並且來晋見葉團長，表示牠們都不願意在×僞的統治下過活，情願爲國效勞，載葉團長的軍隊過湖，由西向東的夾擊合浦鎮。　　葉團長大喜過望，隨即開始來着手反攻的佈置，調全軍最精銳的趙德勝那一大隊担任右翼，搭乘船隻渡湖到合浦鎮去，在反攻戰事發動時，從西門乘其不備的攻入。又命梁團附率一大隊兩中隊担任左翼，從合浦鎮東面進攻。這一隊裏又附以朱參謀率領的一中隊兩縱隊，先和梁團附所率的部隊合併行動，俟到達目的地後，再從鄉僻小路抄到合浦鎮後面去埋伏，一面襲擊由合浦鎮潰退下來的×僞軍，一面隔斷合浦鎮和茗溪鎮的聯絡。又留下一大堆來防守楓林鎮，自率其餘的部隊担任中路，由北而南的向合浦鎮進攻。　（一四一）健康知識問病規則　　本刋爲謀大衆福利起見，特約國內外各科著名醫師，分答各科疾病，來信請附足回信郵資，並詳述姓名，住址，病源，病狀，逕寄北京路一五六號二樓七號健康知識編輯部可也夫婦知識  美國醫學博士姚崇培　性病專科醫生詹念曾合著　　（診所）北京路四川路口中國信託公司二樓　　（時間）上午十時至下午六時星期日休息腎虧男子的一年之計　　也是終生大計　　邵康節先生說：『一日之計在於晨，一年之計在春』。這就是說無論事情的大小遠近，都應得再事先有一個打算，所謂『凡事預則立，不預則廢』。這眞是至理名言。邵先生又說：『一生之計在於勤』，這句話那更有道理，我們做事除有計劃之外，更須要能努力以赴，才有成就。勤，就是努力的意思。不過，努力，必須要以身體健康爲根據，有了健康的身體，思想自然豐富，經歷自然充足……不特在事業或學術上可以作繼續不斷的努力，雖有困難之來，用堅毅沉着的精神克服之，這樣，何往而不利，何事不可成。就是家庭生活的夫婦間，雄健的體魄可以吸引妻子的愛情，生育着活潑的子女，組織着快樂的家庭，當此鳥語花香的春天，工作之暇朝良晨，花園戲院，同來同往，朝歡暮樂，笑語盈盈，這是多麼的幸福！可是男子如果於早年犯有自瀆與遺精，或婚後荒淫縱慾與憂勞斵傷之故，爆發着腎虧無能，精力渙散，久婚不育，神經衰弱，發育不全等症。則不特在事業與學術上，因不能耐勞克苦，將徒見其年齡雖增，而一事無成，潦倒終生。就是在夫婦生活上，亦如何能盡人道，慰藉其妻；開創職業，負担家累。因此，他的妻子，不是受累終生，喪盡幸福，就是另尋出路，別謀良圖。在今日社會上，因夫之虧弱無能，妻憂怨自殺，或與人私通私奔，或公然訴請離婚者，豈不是常有所聞！此種男子在前者爲罪大惡極，在後者乃淪於人生慘境！腎虧之危機爲何似！　　腎虧症之特效療法，據世界名醫及余經騐，均公認服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」爲最佳，因此劑於服後即可生精補腎，健腦活血，滋養神經，若能繼續服用，上述各種各症，均可於短期內完全痊愈。並可收延年益壽返老還童之效。惟有遺精者，須兼服「希米脫氏固精片」以固景觀，制止遺洩，則收效尤速！患者若能親來本診所就專家醫師診斷後，施用電療，注射，手術等科學療法，更可保證治愈。健美乳峯美爲女性幸福的基礎  美國醫學博士姚崇培　　凡是女性，都有這麼兩大企求：一是在處女時，希望似含苞待放的鮮花一樣美麗，能夠到處香噴噴，甜蜜蜜，被人稱讚一聲：「這位姑娘多麼美」，結果嫁得一位好丈夫；一是出嫁以後，希望丈夫的性情，能夠像留蘭香一般的又甜，又軟，又香，親親熱熱，過着快樂日子，生幾個活潑伶俐的小天使，在着身邊跳跳躍躍，並且希望小天使長命百歲，而自己和丈夫白首偕老。　　這樣的企求，雖然人所共有，但據法國婦科專家威泥基與美國生理學家康德林等的論斷，認爲女性而欲獲得此種幸福，第一必須使身體有充分的發育，而尤其必須是乳峯高聳，因爲乳峯能夠愈高而愈有彈性，不僅可以把她丰腴的臀部，與婀娜的腰身，充分襯托出來，構成最神秘的曲腺，使人陶醉愛慕之外，同時更因自身卵巢機能的健全，新陳代謝作用的旺盛，性情無不溫良柔順，肌肉無不晶瑩潔白，面色更無不紅潤而嫵媚，以這樣的健美女性，追求的人必多，揀一個好女壻還成什麽問題，其次再從生育上講，因爲身體發育的完美，月經自然準確，夫婦間情感濃厚，獲孕自然更有把握，不惟此也。同時更因她們乳汁的濃厚，所生的子女，亦必健康而活潑，可是過去如果患有月經不調，白帶，貧血等症，則卵巢機能即受其摧殘，呈衰弱狀態，乳部以及其他的女性特徵美完全喪失，成爲乳癟顏醜之女子，此種女子，不特不爲男子所喜，且類多患有宮冷不娠等症，身世飄零，其命運必悲慘之至！惟一補救辦法，據中外醫師一致公認，祗有服卵巢製劑女用「生殖素」最爲對症而特效，蓋此劑配製精良，服後一日夜間即能培補卵巢機能，旺盛新陳代謝作用，倘繼續服用，不僅可將上述各症根治全愈，並可使乳峯高聳，面泛桃花，增加健美。遺精之弊害和特效療法  性病專科醫師詹念曾　　自瀆是青年人常有的惡習，這是誰都知道的。但自瀆之後究竟有些什麽弊害，誰都知道嗎？恐怕知道的人一定很少。恐怕知道的人一定很少。如果知道的人多的話，那末，爲什麽還有百分之九十以上的青年犯着自瀆呢？你要知道自瀆是一種枯燥而機械的洩慾作用，不特無端喪失貴重的生殖腺液，並因自瀆時一種不自然的刺激和自瀆後的追悔等原因，對於腦，脊髓，性三大神經的損傷亦極大。所以凡有自瀆的青年十之八九必有遺精症。遺精一起，那體內的精液更無限制的向體外遺洩，這是一個多麼危險的景象。如果不加以速即治愈，必至精枯血竭，爆發着腦力衰弱，健忘失眠，思想萎頓，如稍一思索，即覺頭脹腦痛，眼前金華撩亂，耳中如鳴笙簧，…這就是腦神經衰弱的緣故，稍一操勞，即覺腰酸背痛，肢體疲憊，幾乎有動彈不得之慨，這就是脊髓神經衰弱的緣故。至於滑精漏精，腎虧無能，精力渙散…等症象，那更是性神經衰弱的表現。此外因遺精過頻，新陳代謝作用減退，發育機能停滯，致身材低矮，局部短小如指，精液的生產不及，精液中精蟲稀少或竟至全無者，此種青年不特因健康之喪失，事業與學術，毫無寸進，或全歸失敗；就是在婚後的夫婦生活上，亦必不能爲妻滿足，演出家庭間之種種悲劇，或子女無出，貽終生大撼，同時此種青年的壽命亦必短促異常，不未老先衰即早年妖殤，其危險爲何似！　　遺精症的特效療法，在今日只有服「希米脫氏固精片」爲對症可靠。因此藥於服後即能鞏固精關，鎮靜神經，遺精可以當夜治愈。惟因遺精已引起上述症象者，須兼服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」以培補腦腎，增益精血，滋養神經，若繼續服用，必可於短期內完全康復白濁論壇  淋病專科戴德醫師撰　　診所　北京路四川路轉角　　義務送診僅收號金四角白濁全治的决定　　白濁果以尿液完全透明，或毫無淋系與浮游物，即認爲斷根乎？抑使用尿液以顯微鏡檢查時，不發見膿球而以爲治愈乎？是亦不盡然也。因爲從有經騐，有見識之醫家診察之，必不以尿液清澈，及尿液中不見膿球爲已可放心之根治。原來曾經淋菌蹂躪之淋病患者，其淋菌多潛伏於組織之深部，恒攝取營養而生存，並且繼續實行其繁殖工作，因爲在某一時期，粘膜上有相當時期之免疫性，所以此時潛伏之淋菌，不敢逞暴，在外表上觀之，好似已經完全斷根。可是此種粘膜上所保持之免疫性的能力，亦自有其限度，一經過此種限度，換言之，此種免疫性消失後，潛伏之淋菌，重行恢復其原有之凶暴性，所以病況較以前更深一層，於治療上亦更覺棘手，此爲每個淋病患者，不可不主意之事。　　要根本識破此種僞性的假愈，不單用尿液作顯微鏡檢查，必用攝護腺按摩法，將具漓出之液體，用培養法試騐之，往往可以發見病菌。有時用尿的培養試騐亦可，不過此種檢查的方法，必須嚴密，所以無經騐與手術生疎之醫家，往往不能勝任。如已經發見淋菌時，即用德國濾淋平流電療法，以導子插入尿道，俾潛處組織深部之淋菌，亦可撲滅，並用後尿道注入法，與靜脈注射療法，使淋菌絕對無立足之地，如此繼續治療至多三四星期，可以完全根治。凡是屢次再發之白濁，應用此法保證斷根。　　診時：上午九時至六時止　　科目　兼治梅毒。橫痃。下疳。及無痛苦新法割除包皮。</p>

<p>春秋「現實」與「理想」  戈兒　　自從德國把捷克吞併後，倫敦的政界人士就張伯倫首相在伯明罕城所發表之演說加以評論：「認爲首相在此次事變中所獲得之教訓，業已充分人士，因此即當以「現實主義的政策，」代替「理想主義的政策」云。　　一看到「理想主義」這幾個字眼兒，在我的腦際中不自覺地想起了俄國一位偉大的政治諷刺作家S.薩爾蒂柯夫作的一篇諷刺作品，呌作「理想主義者的鯉魚」的來了。雖然這篇作品與我現在所想起的張伯倫首相的以「現實主義的政策」代替「理想主義的政策，」是有點格格不入，然而S.薩爾蒂柯夫對沒有把「現實」作基礎的「理想主義者」加以諷嘲的一點，倒是非常的確當。　　在「理想主義者的鯉魚」中，原來鯉魚是固執着「一個人單靠着眞理就可以活在世上」的；可是「懷疑主義者的刺魚」呢，却不然，他以爲「如果沒有一點兒機巧，是活不下去的。」兩個兒的意見旣然這樣不同，於是大家一碰頭就爭論起來的事就免不掉了。　　魚類中雖然有吃掉鯉魚的一種「梭魚」存在，可是鯉魚却始終相信「和平的，不流血的成功，」刺魚以爲這是「有點兒自己安慰自己」，鯉魚却不以爲然，他說：「我是要等的，我準可以得着牠。」牠者即「眞理」也。鯉魚認爲這「眞理」是有一天會「和平的不流血」的普及於全魚類的。鯉魚還以爲生活里面。「善」演着最重要的作用，而「惡呢，只有……只有由於誤會的時候才被容許。」對於梭魚要「吃他」，他認爲梭魚沒有這樣的「權利」，梭魚要吃他，必須要梭魚說明「理由」，鯉魚就理直氣壯的說：「我是定規要對他（梭魚）說明的，我要告訴他全部眞理，我要用眞理教他流上七次的汗。」　　鯉魚這種的說法，有一天，給梭魚聽到了，梭魚就「召見」他，鯉魚一看見梭魚那種「和藹可親的樣子」。就斷定人們告訴梭魚那種話全是「毀謗」的了，雖然梭魚的嘴巴是「一直裂到耳朵邊」，表明「吃的胃口」是相當的大，於是鯉魚就把他的「全部的眞理」向梭魚去宣述了，他告訴梭魚說：「魚類應當彼此相親相愛，他們應有『人人爲我，我爲人人』的精神，那才是眞正的和協完成的時候」。他又對梭魚說：「可敬的老伯！你老人家沒有不經審判就使我受到這種可怕的懲罰的呀！」說這話，因爲梭魚問到要吃鯉魚的時候，他認爲梭魚要吃他，必須「先經審判」。鯉魚這樣話，越說越把梭魚激怒起來了，他認爲鯉魚是「社會主義者」、這正跟現在的希特勒說羅斯福是「社會主義者」是一個樣兒的，因此梭魚就要吃鯉魚了，鯉魚大恐，就呌道：「你可知道德是什麽？在你和你的隣人的關係上，道德給你些什麽責任？」這話因爲他發急，所以只說是「你知道道德是什麽？」話未完，鯉魚已被梭魚吃了！　　鯉魚的「理想主義」因爲沒有把「梭魚」放在眼中，所以結局自己傷失了生命。所以張伯倫欲以「現實主義的政策」代替「理想主義的政策」，我認爲也得把「侵略陣綫放在眼中才好，要不然，準也會蹈S.薩爾蒂柯夫的「理想主義者的鯉魚」的命運了呢！現在是事急矣！「貢格廷」觀後感  白華　　“Gunga　Din”　　雷電華公司出品　南京大戲院映　　關於吉百齡先生，慚愧得很，實在我知道得少到不能再少了，即是他的原著Barrack　Room　Bollads和銀幕上的「貢格廷」有無出入之處，或是錯異到如何程度，也是一無所知；不過就從所看到的「貢格廷」來猜測一下，這位大詩人的「詩意」，已經完全從他的作品中透露出來了。　　「貢格廷」告訴我們：『印度境內，有宗教團體曰「吐葛」，膜拜血神「卡利」。教民均嗜殺好鬥，悍勇蠻橫，殺人越貨，出沒無常。駐軍及土人，往往遭其屠殺。』如這樣野蠻的民族，在大詩人的目光中自然是認爲「不列顛武士」的死敵了。於是在他筆底下的「貢格廷」，也展開了像「擊鼓聲動」那樣的一個故事，而那個薩菩的小土人現在是呌作「貢格廷」了。使人更「感動」的，是這位貢格廷不但引路，服役而且是「殺身成仁」。銀幕上映到貢格廷被刺以後，蘇格蘭的音樂聲也不先不後浩浩蕩蕩整隊　來，同時這野蠻民族已在要道埋伏士兵，準備等候着廝殺；我們的貢格廷看到了這千鈞一髮的危機，他是竭着「最後一滴血」爬到塔尖上去，吹出了警告的軍號，…這樣的故事，這樣的塲面，怎不呌忍不是感動得下淚呢。我自然不能例外，也被他「感動」了一下；不過我同時也看到了另外感動的一面：　　吉伯齡先生果然把這野蠻民族寫得野蠻得很，「殺人越貨，出沒無常」，如卡雷葛倫和貢格廷到土人廟宇盜金的時候，他們親眼目睹「祭師登壇說法，煽惑土人肆意屠殺以媚神」，那祭師的面目，更是可怕異常。但是在祭師被綁上塔定，蘇格蘭軍隊來攻的時候，他是那樣地喊着：「不能爲了我的聲明，危害到一族的生死」！而且更堅決地給予他的士兵們一個有力的表示，他自己跳到滿儲着毒蛇的池子裏自盡了。——這殺身的祭師却眞的感動我了，他祗是被塗上了野蠻的彩色，實際並不是那樣可怕的野蠻民族，而同樣是有血，有肉，剛過，正義的民族呢。　　至於「貢格廷」的演出，我們不能否認是比「擊鼓聲動」更可愛，這倒並不是因爲「貢格廷」有許多刺激，緊張的大塲面，相反的，在最後廝殺的大塲面上，是並不處理得怎樣好的，有幾個畫面的編織，簡直使人看不清楚「文明」和「野蠻」之分，祗是亂哄哄的大塲面而已。所謂比「擊鼓聲動」可愛者，可以分作以下幾點：（一）導演者喬治史蒂文斯對於卡雷葛倫，維克多麥克勞倫，及小范朋克這三個人物個性格把握底強固：如卡雷葛倫是一個掘金的幻想者，維克多麥克勞倫是個爲兵士而兵士的粗漢，小范朋克是一個想期滿離開軍隊，和愛人結婚底多情的傻瓜。對於這三個不同性格人物，導演者處把他們勾劃得非常鮮明；（二）對於這三個人物底友誼聯系：如駐軍第二次出發到坦托拉波去，小范朋克因將結婚，大佐派希金波丹替代的時候，卡雷葛倫和維克多麥克勞倫設計用藥酒使希金波丹生病，小范朋克被迫入隊，及至卡雷葛倫被執土入廟，小范朋克役期已滿，愛人親來迎接，但是聽到卡雷葛倫被執的消息，他不顧一切地走了，那是寫得非常有力而生動的；（三）全片充滿着風趣的情調：這雖然是由於這三個不同性格的人物所決定的，但如第一次道坦托拉波和土人激戰；卡雷葛倫和維克多麥克勞倫的設計使希金波丹飲酒；小范朋克被迫入隊；卡雷葛倫聽了貢格廷聽了貢格廷的講述，飲酒飲酒后和維克多麥克勞倫的爭辯…等等許多戲，處理得那樣風趣無比，當然，也得歸功於導演的；（四）貢格廷這人物的處理，導演著也是非常謹慎的。（因爲這是詩人的靈魂啊！）　　演員：卡雷葛倫，維克多麥克勞倫和小范朋克都很好，尤其是小范朋克這角色的容易討好，給人的印象更深刻。瓊芳泰妮出塲不多，却很嫵媚可愛。飾貢格廷的賽傑飛，他決定能使吉伯齡先生瞑目的。　　我對於「貢格廷」的觀後感，大槪如此，其餘祗得等着「專家」來寫「論文」了。織襪的女工  許由　　租織襪機還要出「運動費」　　縫襪頭每打工資祗有四分　　在事業的飢餓聲中，丈夫的失業，令妻子不得不前去尋找出路：織襪子便是一班女子所競爭的目標。假如是某一個廠家有一架織襪機是空着，立刻就有許多工人想搶到它來維持自己的生活。至於工錢的多少，工作的勞苦，全都不管，只要能做一天工作，使全家不會整天的餓肚皮，就已經很好了。　　在商業資本家剝削下的勞働婦女，她們的生活，當時十分淒慘；資本家是不肯虧本的，他們想盡了種種巧妙的方法，來塡補自己因戰事而受的損失；用着各種的剝削方法，來塞滿自己的腰包，因此首先就大大地減少了工人的工資，並延長她們的工作時間。　　她們在極小心的工作下，偶一不留神，那織襪機筒裏的鋼針，往往會斷掉，所以老闆要怪她們做事不當心，或是有意弄斷的，故此要照價賠償：如襪子做壞了一隻，所以在發工錢的時候，因爲要扣除賠針，賠襪的錢，當當只能拿到七八成的工錢。　　這些貧窮的勞動婦女，要得到一架織襪機，不是一件容易的事，她們一定要哀求苦懇的請一種面子的人去說，或暗中塞了些「運動費」，方才能得到一架機器來織襪；當她們得到了一架織襪機後，她們是何等的小心和勤懇地織着。　　老闆秤了一定分量的紗，發給一個勞動婦女，規定她每日至少要織成一打半的細襪，或者兩打半的粗襪，倘若她不能織道所規定的襪子，或織得不好，那末老闆一定會扳着面孔責罰她，甚至因此收回她的洋襪機；所以那些勞動婦女，爲着生活，不得不拼了性命，整天毫不休息的織着；當她們織成襪子後，立刻交給老闆，那織襪老闆，再把已織成的襪子，分給許多貧家小姑娘，去縫襪頭和貼商標的工作。　　這許多織襪婦女，每天至少能織成細襪一打半到兩打，每打工資按其成績優劣而有二角到三角五分的分別，粗襪每天能織成三打或四打，每打工資由一角二分到二角：縫襪頭每天能縫兩打到三打，每打的工資，受出來眞是經人；縫成一打襪子所換得的代價，祗有四分錢。　　在資本家的無理的榨取之下，「孤島」勞動的婦女們，呻吟着目前的恐慌，何年何月才是她們解放之日？何處才是她們的安樂之鄉？雨過天青  包天笑　　第六回　誇人瑞一苗挺三秀　叙友情二士會羣英　　人家因此問她：葉醫師眞能深諳避孕之方嗎？要生育，便生育；要不生育，便不生育。她只是微笑不答。其實照近來醫理日漸進步而論，這個主，似乎男女兩方，自己可以做的。何況男女兩方都是醫學家呢？即使要生育，便生育，稍爲難些。那個要不生育，便不生育，却一定是可以做得到了。有人說：葉醫師眞也未必能做得動主，只不過自誇罷了。然而這四歲的小妹妹生了以後，沒有生過，這是眞的。除了劉葉兩位醫師以外，還有一位，是育嬰院的幼稚園主任，童海嬰女士，也是住在老章醫師那裏的。這位童小姐，年紀還輕，只有二十歲，她是在幼稚師範學校裏畢業的，章醫師特請她來當主任。因爲這個育嬰院，有許多嬰孩，極爲幼小。有僅僅幾個月的，有不滿一年的，有未及三四年的。但到了四歲的時候，就要進幼稚園了。唱歌，遊戲，吃飯，穿衣，都要有人引導照顧。到晚上由各保姆去伴他們安睡，白天便到幼稚園來。這位童海嬰小姐，對於這班小弟弟，小妹妹，極有耐心。因爲這也是各人性之所近，有許多人是喜歡小孩子的，有許多人是不喜歡小孩子的，有許多人對於小孩子非常燙貼的，有許多人對於小孩子極其粗暴的。童小姐却從無疾言遽色，而且循循善誘，所以章醫師覺得最爲適當了。除了這幾位以外，其餘有好多人，雖不住在章醫師那裏，却因爲這幾位住在那裏，所以也常來常往，顯見得熱鬧起來了。現在又來了何家小姐，這老章醫師宅子裏，更覺得笑語聲喧。不過他們因爲朝晨起身得很早，夜裏也睡得很早，到十點鐘光景，大家都熄燈安睡了。明天早晨，六點鐘便起身，不過到了冬天，六點鐘天還沒亮，她們都在七點鐘。但她們八小時睡眠，是實行了。工作的時間，便不止八小時，沒有法子，只好把休憇的時間，勻出來了。好在他們還有七日一來復，每逢星期，可以休憇一天。大槪復興的中國，工作時間，要比別國多一些了。（六八）</p>

<h3>Wu City Battle Gradually Stabilizing, River Repair, Two Armies Confronting, Chinese Dominance</h3>
<p>Fierce Battle for Many Days, Japanese Corpses Pile Up by the Thousands, Chinese Army Enters Strong Position</p>
<p>Japanese Planes Bombard Frantically, One Shot Down, Remainder Flee Wounded</p>
<p>(Changde) Military authorities received a telegram from Nanchang stating that large groups of Japanese planes took turns bombarding the Xiushui area all day long in batches, covering Japanese troops in battle. In the Nanchang-Xunyang Road battle, the Chinese and Japanese sides are now confronting each other at the San Gong Ferry on the Xiushui River. The situation is extremely fierce, and the Chinese side still holds the advantage. (Telegram of the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Sources here claim that the Japanese clearly intend to advance on Nanchang and are now dividing their forces into six routes to advance on Nanchang. The main force is attacking the Yongxiu area, and the battle has now expanded from Duchang on the east bank of Poyang Lake to Wucheng on the west bank, and continues to expand westward through Yongxiu, Qiujin, Ruoxi, and Wuning. (Reuters telegram of the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) On the 21st, Japanese planes bombed the south bank of the Xiushui River several times. The Chinese anti-aircraft units gave them fierce fire. One Japanese plane was hit, caught fire, and immediately fell in front of the Chinese position. Many of the remaining planes were also damaged and fled in a sorry state. (Telegram of the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) It is reported that the situation in northern Jiangxi is tense. On the west bank of Yongxiu, near Qiujin, the Japanese army shelled all day on the 20th. In the evening, the Japanese army crossed the Xiushui River in several places and is now engaged in fierce fighting with the Chinese army. The situation in the Shishi Mountain area is unclear. The Chinese army at Shangtantou and Luopan Mountain in the northeast of Wuning in the upper reaches of the Xiushui River has shifted its position, and the Japanese army has reached the line of Danaojian and Huijiashan in the west. (Special dispatch from Jishi on the afternoon of the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The Chinese army is exerting pressure to stop the Japanese army from crossing the Xiushui River. It is reported that the two sides are holding each other in Ziluqiao and Xingshuilong south of Xiushui. The battle line has been extended to 20 kilometers. It is reported that the Chinese army is setting up artillery positions at Anlongqiao south of Yongxiu, and is annihilating a group of Japanese mobile units that have sneaked into Anyi. It is reported that the Chinese side has gathered a large number of troops on the Anshi-Wanjiafu highway, enough to block the Japanese army's advance, and there are even more heavy troops gathered in the area north of Nanchang. Also, the Japanese army on the Wuning road has suffered a disastrous defeat. No fewer than 650 of them have been annihilated by the Chinese army, and there are more than 1,000 Japanese corpses floating in the Xiushui River, all sacrificed during the forced crossing. (Express News Agency telegram of the 23rd)</p>
<p>Guilin About 20,000 Japanese troops with more than ten tanks invaded the Ruoxi Daqiaohe area in two routes: one route advanced westward from Daqiaohe and the other attacked westward along the Ruoxi Highway. (Telegram of the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The Japanese army's ambition to attack Nanchang in northern Jiangxi is becoming more and more obvious. On the 21st, the 6th and 106th Divisions, totaling 20,000 men, were used as the main force, and they attacked Wuning on the bank of the Xiushui River in several routes with all their strength. The two sides then launched an unprecedented bloody battle. The Chinese army resisted desperately, and the Japanese army made no progress until late at night, and was still confronting each other in the Chenzhuang area outside Wuning. On the morning of the 21st, General Luo Zhuoying, commander of the Chinese army, personally rode to the front line to supervise the battle. Reinforcements also arrived in large numbers, so the morale of the Chinese army in the front of northern Jiangxi was greatly boosted. On the same day, they began a counterattack and launched a bayonet charge with the Japanese army. At the same time, a part of the Chinese army secretly crossed the Xiushui River and outflanked the Japanese artillery position. After a fierce battle, the Japanese Ikeda unit was defeated and more than 700 were killed. The remnants of the Japanese army abandoned their weapons and fled. The Chinese army then intercepted 32 artillery pieces, but because they could not be carried, they placed explosives and destroyed them all. When the Japanese army arrived, the Chinese army had safely returned to its position. (Express News Agency telegram of the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Although the Japanese side here is promoting that it has made progress on the Nanchang-Xunyang Road and has occupied Anyi, according to Chinese sources, the Japanese army is still being blocked at Shenjiabu. The port is located 22 kilometers west of Yongxiu. The Japanese army seems to attach great importance to the military strategic position of Shenjiabu. It has repeatedly attacked the place with tanks, but has failed. Only some mobile infantry units have sneaked into Anlongqiao and Xiamayuan and other places, but after being discovered by the Chinese army, they were immediately annihilated. The Japanese army, seeing that the Chinese army's resistance on the land was strong and unable to make progress, tried to open a bloody path with the air force. Therefore, in recent days, it has sent more than 80 planes to bomb the rear of the Chinese army. (Express News Agency telegram of the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) The battle in Wucheng is gradually stabilizing. Since the morning of the 18th, two small Japanese ships and thirty or forty motorboats sailed from Xingzi and shelled Wucheng more than 500 times. Most of the houses in the city were destroyed. At noon, more than 200 Japanese troops attempted to land on Yejiuzhou, and fierce artillery battles broke out between the two sides. One small Japanese warship and three or four motorboats were sunk by the Chinese army, and the Japanese flames were slightly diminished. On the morning of the 19th, five or six hundred Japanese troops changed their landing site to Linggongzhou in the northwest of Wucheng, and then fled south to Hexilong. After half a day of fierce fighting, a part of Hexilong was occupied by the Japanese army. In the afternoon of the same day, the Chinese army counterattacked and recovered Hexilong. On the morning of the 20th, the Japanese army changed its landing site to the area of Longtoushan Songmenshan (about 20 li northeast of Wucheng). The area protruded into the lake, and the Chinese defenders fought hard until noon and moved to a new position. The Japanese army continued to invade Jishan, and the fighting was very fierce. At about 3 p.m., the Chinese side abandoned Jishan. On the morning of the same day, under the cover of Japanese planes and fierce artillery fire and poison gas, the Japanese army once again landed at Wanjun Temple west of Hexilong. Two or three hundred Japanese troops also landed and have been annihilated by the Chinese army. (Telegram of the 22nd)</p>

Knowing that the Chinese oil was prepared, they fled east. Yesterday afternoon, four more Japanese warships fired more than 100 shells at the coast of Zhenhai. After being counterattacked by the Chinese army, one large Japanese warship was severely damaged and the Japanese warships fled. Also, one large warship and two small warships arrived near Damenshan, Yuhuan yesterday. Four Japanese planes took off from the warship and scouted the Taiwan-Wen area.

<h3>Jinhekou, Gujiao and Other Places Recaptured Successively</h3>
<p>Xingji At the beginning of this month, Japanese troops from Taiyuan, Xinxian, Qingyuan and other places gathered 7,000 troops and divided into areas west of Taiyuan. After fierce fighting for ten days, 400 Japanese troops were killed, one was captured, and dozens of machine guns were seized. He Kou, Gu Jiao, Guan Kou, Bai Hu and other places were recaptured successively. Now the Japanese army only occupies Wang Fengzhen. After two night attacks by the Chinese army, they are trapped in the town and dare not go out. The Japanese army that retreated from Gujiao to Wufeng Mountain is currently being surrounded and annihilated by the Chinese army. (Telegram of the 23rd)</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang Believes That He Can Conduct An Indefinite Protracted War of Resistance Against Japan</h3>
<p>Japan Attempts to Organize the Import of Military Supplies into China</p>
<p>But There is Still a Sufficient Supply of Munitions Coming in Steadily</p>
<p>(Washington) Washington diplomatic sources today, based on recent secret reports from the Chinese mainland, declared that China's unity has increased, and Chairman Chiang can conduct an indefinite protracted war against Japan. In recent weeks, although the situation in Europe has been extremely tense, the opportunity for China to extend its organized war of resistance against Japan has not been affected. Although the Japanese side has tried various methods to prevent the import of military supplies into the Chinese mainland, China still has a sufficient supply of military supplies coming in steadily. The Soviet Union also has a large number of munitions being shipped to China. Foreign observers in China are very impressed with the war of resistance of the Eighth Route Army. The Eighth Route Army, which has been trained in guerrilla warfare, will continue to be an obstacle to the Japanese army in China. According to diplomatic sources, after the fall of Guangzhou, more central troops were sent to southern China than expected. The news that the Japanese army has increased its garrison on the Soviet-Russian border does not attract the special attention of officials, because the "alarms" on the border have always calmed down in an instant. Officials believe that a serious dispute is expected to occur in Europe, and their eyes are focused on the development of the situation in Europe, while the actions of the Japanese army on the Soviet border are less likely to attract attention.

<h3>Saying That Foreign Minister Wang Resigned is a Rumor Made by the Japanese</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) A certain foreign reporter, claiming that the Japanese side declared that Foreign Minister Wang had resigned and went to Hong Kong, and said that the reason for the resignation was a disagreement with the central government, went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to inquire about the truth. It happened that Foreign Minister Wang was in the ministry and was received and said that this was purely a rumor made by the Japanese and not worth laughing at. The Japanese claimed last December that I had gone to Hanoi, and now they say that I have resigned and gone to Hong Kong. In fact, since I came to Chongqing from Wuhan at the end of July last year, I have not left Chongqing a single step. The Japanese rumors can be self-defeating. As for my handling of foreign affairs, it is entirely based on the central government's policies, and at the same time, I deeply believe that the central bank's policies are the only way to resist Japan and build the country. What the Japanese said that I disagree with the central government and have resigned is all fabricated, deceiving others and deceiving oneself. (Telegram of the 22nd)</p>

<h3>The Question of British and French Credibility</h3>
<p>The world is consumed with anxiety and fear that war is imminent, a situation that has persisted for quite some time. Crisis lurks at every turn, and people cling to the hope of maintaining the status quo, wishing for all parties to act with caution to prevent a spark from igniting the powder keg. Yet, just a few days ago, the German leader, Herr Hitler, seized Czechoslovakia and strangled it. What sort of action is this? The ink from the Munich agreement guaranteeing the remaining territory of Czechoslovakia is not yet dry, and the National Socialist Party's banner of racial supremacy remains aloft. Can England, France, and even the Soviet Union and the United States not react in anger, considering this latest outrage an unbearable offense? Thus, those who are upright and conscientious lament the impending retribution to befall the German people, and grieve even more for the calamity that threatens all of humanity. Driven to this point, everyone believes that the fuse has been lit and that an explosion is imminent. But Hitler remains unperturbed, and without a moment's rest, he presses on, again demanding from Lithuania, with an air of gentle persuasion, the Memel region. He obtains it with a single demand. This is his response to the international clamor, declaring, "I will do as I please, and the facts speak for themselves." This is his reassurance to the world's anxiety, saying, "I have placed Memel under the swastika without firing a shot or spilling a drop of blood; there is no cause for alarm."</p>
<p>Over the past year, the state of the world and the hearts of men have undergone dramatic changes. Borders have shifted, maps have changed color, the strong and the weak have parted ways, and influence has waxed and waned. International relations have lost their established order, and humanity has lost its shared faith. Commentators often point to Germany, Italy, and Japan as discarding morality, violating treaties, acting perversely, and breaking promises, leading to the collapse of order and the recurrence of calamities. However, when tracing back to the root and source of the problem, when assigning blame to the ringleaders and holding them responsible, Germany, Italy, and Japan must bear the full responsibility, and Japan cannot escape the condemnation of future generations. However, strictly speaking, while their punishable violation of the rules is clear, can those who condone and enable it be excused? Japan trampled on Liaoning, but where were the signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty? Italy used force against Abyssinia, but where were the sanctions of the League of Nations? Germany coveted the Sudetenland, but the League of Nations remained silent, and where were France and the Soviet Union, who had treaties with Czechoslovakia? During the Spanish Civil War, it was obvious that foreign powers were assisting the rebellion with their armies, yet they blockaded the borders and prohibited the export of weapons, posing as law-abiding and righteous nations. Then, Japan closed the door in Manchuria, Italy refused to withdraw its volunteer soldiers, and Germany annexed Czechoslovakia and Austria. All nations failed to fulfill their promised and inherent responsibilities, and disregarded the sanctity of their treaty obligations. Thus, events have unfolded repeatedly to the present day. Therefore, it can be said that those who actively discard morality, violate treaties, act perversely, and break promises, such as Germany, Italy, and Japan, are truly criminals against human civilization. But the countries of England and France, by their neglect of responsibility and abandonment of duty, are also seriously guilty of passively causing the loss of international order and the loss of faith among humanity. Retribution is inevitable, and some will be slapped in the face directly. Is it possible that those who are clear in condemning Germany, Italy, and Japan, but blind to their own failings, can abandon their apathy and act decisively?</p>
<p>In today's world, Germany, Italy, and Japan are seen as aggressor nations, either deeply hated and loathed, or regarded with caution and guarded against. This is a common sentiment, a common attitude. The only nation to defy them, to strike at their vulnerable spots, is the Republic of China. If there is any hope of limiting the expansion and resisting the aggression of Germany, Italy, and Japan, it lies with England and France. England and France have so far done little, but any nation that might be subjected to aggression by Germany, Italy, and Japan places great importance on gaining the favor of England and France. This is dictated by the circumstances, and is also a matter of course. England then acts with self-restraint, considering itself to bear a heavy responsibility to the world. The United States sympathizes, and regards England and France as the pillars of democracy, seeing them as objects of support. However, England readily offered guarantees to the Nordic countries, only to be met with a cold response from Norway. It drafted a collective declaration, only to be rejected by Poland's insistence on isolation. This shows that while Germany, Italy, and Japan are undeniably to blame for destroying international norms and shaking the common faith of humanity, a widespread destruction and shaking have already taken place, and even England and France cannot remain unscathed. Is this not the beginning of a great calamity for mankind?</p>
<p>According to a Norwegian dispatch from the 20th, after Norway learned that Britain had expressed its willingness to guarantee the safety of the Nordic countries, the Speaker of the Norwegian Parliament, Hambro, responded by saying, "We have neither sought guarantees nor do we hope that any one country or several countries will guarantee the security of our country in any form." He also said that he had never believed in promises of international security. According to a London dispatch from the 21st, France and Russia had no problem with the collective security declaration drafted by Britain, but Poland refused to participate, saying that it had already reached agreements with France and could contact Romania at any time. Its true intention was that the declaration was not reliable and would only offend Germany, which was unacceptable. Are security guarantees and joint declarations not major undertakings aimed at addressing an unfavorable reality? Are Norway and Poland not weak and small countries that lack the ability to defend themselves and rely on strong support? Given this attitude, it is clear that the common rules of international conduct and the shared faith of mankind have been completely lost, and must be re-established before they can be effective again. Germany, Italy, and Japan should not be blamed; the key lies in England and France fulfilling their responsibilities and shouldering their obligations from now on. Only then can there be hope for clarifying the international situation. Is it not because Hitler has seen through the empty words and inaction of England and France that he acts so recklessly and disregards everything?</p>
<h3>Central Executive Committee Resolution: Outline for "March 29th" Propaganda</h3>
<p>Carry on the revolutionary spirit of the martyrs, fulfilling their legacy of nation-building.</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The Fifth Session of the Central Executive Committee on March 1st resolved the memorial propaganda outline for the "March 29th" Huanghuagang Seventy-Two Martyrs as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Significance of "March 29th"</p>
<p>(1) The "March 29th" Huanghuagang Uprising was the prelude to the revolution. Due to this uprising, it shook both domestically and internationally, and actually stirred up a nationwide revolutionary upsurge of the people to overthrow the Manchu Qing autocratic government.</p>
<p>(2) The loyalty, courage, and sacrifice of the "March 29th" Seventy-Two Martyrs were the inspiration of revolutionary personality and the practical consciousness of the Three Principles of the People.</p>
<p>(3) The revolutionary martyrs of "March 29th" exhausted their efforts to overthrow the corrupt Manchu Qing autocratic government and establish a republic based on the Three Principles of the People.</p>
<p>(4) The "March 29th" uprising proved that overseas Chinese had a significant contribution and role in the construction movement of the new China, and also proved that only with a great spirit can material be used to establish a great cause.</p>
<p>(B) The Course of "March 29th"</p>
<p>The "March 29th" Huanghuagang Uprising was a follow-up to the failed uprising of the Guangdong New Army two years before the founding of the Republic of China. The location of the uprising was in Guangzhou, and the general headquarters for planning the uprising was set up in Hong Kong. Huang Xing served as the commander-in-chief, and Xie Liangmu raised tens of thousands of shields in funding from overseas Chinese in Nanyang. At the time of the uprising, Huang Xing led more than a hundred comrades to attack the Governor-General's Office. Later, due to the Guangdong Governor-General Zhang Mingqi dispatching troops to encircle and suppress them, they failed quickly. Later, the Guangdong Governor-General implemented even more terror policies, and Party members and civilians with their hair cut off were arrested and killed in large numbers. However, the more severe the oppression, the more violent the resistance. The doctrine had already penetrated the hearts of the people, and the revolutionary trend could not be stopped in the end. Therefore, there was the follow-up of the Wuchang Uprising on October 10th to carry forward the unfinished legacy of the martyrs and establish the foundation of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>(C) Current tasks to commemorate "March 29th"</p>
<p>(1) To inherit the indomitable and heroic spirit of struggle of the revolutionary martyrs of "March 29th", firmly believe in the "inevitable victory of the War of Resistance, and the inevitable success of nation-building, without seeking momentary ease, without fearing difficulties, and resisting until the end. All agencies and groups nationwide must deeply publicize the spirit of sacrifice of the Seventy-Two Martyrs of Huanghuagang and the martyrs to all officers and soldiers nationwide, and to the people across the country, implement the General Mobilization of the National Spirit, so that everyone deeply recognizes the final victory, and so that the whole country understands "Compromise in the middle is destruction," firmly establish a common faith, and encourage their participation in the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>(2) The revolutionary martyrs' correct understanding, great sacrifice, created the Republic of China. Currently, the enemy not only wants to destroy our country but also wants to destroy our race. At this time, to commemorate the martyrs, everyone should actively enlist in the army, rise up to participate in the War of Resistance, drive out the enemy, and recover lost territories.</p>
<p>(3) The revolutionary martyrs' strategy, in this uprising to overthrow the Qing Dynasty, utilized the Qing government's internal contradictions, penetrated into various places, and won over the Qing government's troops. Now that we are fighting against the Japanese invaders, we should also intensify propaganda against the enemy puppets, mobilize them to go behind enemy lines, win over the puppet troops, and disintegrate the enemy.</p>
<p>(4) One of the great recognitions of the revolutionary martyrs was to advocate the equality and mutual assistance of all ethnic groups in the country. Currently, our sacred War of Resistance is not only a war of resistance for the whole people, but also a war of resistance for the unity of all ethnic groups in the country. This is to intensify the awakening of ethnic minorities in the country and strengthen the unity of ethnic minorities in the country to respond to the enemy's conspiracy to divide.</p>
<p>(5) The revolutionary martyrs carried out continuous propaganda and organization movements among overseas Chinese, and obtained great assistance from overseas Chinese. This valuable experience makes us absolutely unable to forget the position of overseas Chinese in the War of Resistance. In fact, overseas Chinese have contributed a lot of strength since the War of Resistance. We should also continue to strengthen our work for overseas compatriots, especially to make the most use of overseas Chinese capital to carry out the construction of the national defense economy.</p>
<p>(D) Our slogans are:</p>
<p>(1) Commemorate "March 29th" to inherit the spirit of sacrifice of the revolutionary martyrs.</p>
<p>(2) Commemorate "March 29th" to fulfill the legacy of nation-building of the revolutionary martyrs.</p>
<p>(3) Support the National Government and obey the Supreme Leader.</p>
<p>(4) Implement the Three Principles of the People.</p>
<p>(5) Commemorate "March 29th" to implement general spiritual mobilization.</p>
<p>(6) Commemorate "March 29th" to strengthen domestic unity.</p>
<p>(7) Commemorate "March 29th" to mobilize overseas Chinese capital.</p>
<p>(8) Commemorate "March 29th" to resist until the end.</p>
<p>(9) Commemorate "March 29th" to disintegrate the Japanese army.</p>
<p>(10) Commemorate "March 29th" to win over the puppet army.</p>
<p>(11) Commemorate "March 29th" to actively enlist in the army.</p>
<p>(12) Commemorate "March 29th" to work hard in the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>(13) The spirit of the revolutionary martyrs is immortal.</p>
<p>(14) Down with Japanese imperialism.</p>
<p>(15) Long live the Republic of China.</p>
<p>(16) Long live the Chinese Kuomintang.</p>
<p>(17) Long live the Leader. (Dispatch from the 22nd)</p>

<h3>The Puppet Envoys of Beiping Leave for Japan Today</h3>
<p>Request the Japanese Government to Control the Economy of North China</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to the minutes of the "Provisional Government" released today, the economic envoys visiting Japan will leave here for Japan on the 22nd. In general terms, their mission is almost entirely to request the Japanese government to control the entire economy of North China. The trade issues they plan to discuss with the Japanese side include: (1) customs tariff issues regarding rayon, semi-silk, semi-wool, electrical machinery, locomotives, agricultural machinery, and marine fertilizers; (2) the standards for assessing tariffs. According to the minutes, their hope is to restore the ad valorem export tariffs, while the tariffs on various goods must be the same as those implemented in "Manchukuo," such as duty-free wool, and reduced tariffs on coal and charcoal. In addition, all goods that are not produced in North China but are unique to South China will be exempted or reduced in import tariffs. As for the import tariffs on wheat flour, they will be increased to encourage production. Furthermore, the customs gold unit system will be abolished and replaced by the banknotes of the "Preparation Bank." In addition, the issues to be discussed with the Japanese side include: (1) import tariffs on daily necessities for the general public in North China, such as various machines, fertilizers, hats, shirts, spices, soda, medicines, etc.; (2) how to promote trade between Japan and China, such as the export of wool, cotton, iron salt, etc., and the import of manufactured goods and medicines. The minutes also stated that they hope the Japanese can control the export trade of third-country people, and after expanding the Tanggu-Zhanhai ports, they hope that Japanese ships can see a significant increase, and the import of Japanese goods can also see a significant increase. They also requested that the Japanese side send more technical supervisors to assist Chinese factories in researching and exploring new markets for industrial cooperation. They also hope that the Japanese can invest heavily to increase the production of cotton, wheat, tobacco, rice, livestock, etc., and develop mineral resources.</p>

<h3>Japanese Prisoners of War Zhongshan Bao and Others Participate in Frugality and Offerings</h3>
<p>And Published an Essay Describing the Significance of the Offerings</p>
<p>(Xi'an) This decision on the frugality offering movement, all walks of life actively participate, the situation is very enthusiastic. The prisoners in the prisoner-of-war camp heard about it and were very moved. After the prisoners Zhongshan Bao and others voluntarily requested, they were allowed to fast and participate in the offering to express their condolences. It is estimated that Zhongshan Bao's five-day fasting cost one yuan, and Mori Shitakuro, Tanaka Teruko (Korean female prisoner), and others' two-day fasting cost a total of two yuan and eight cents. The total is three yuan and eight cents. Zhongshan Bao also wrote an article on frugality offerings, describing the great significance of the offering, as follows: According to the director, dear Chinese comrades, are all implementing frugality offerings. After I heard about it, I immediately asked the director to save my food expenses to defeat the Japanese warlords and plutocrats who disturb East Asia and continue the war of aggression. I was allowed. I am now implementing the following well-known words: During the European War, the French people, in the face of the urgent situation, worked in the rear and did national salvation work. For the sake of the country, even if it fell into poverty, there was no dissatisfaction. The whole body was frugal and diligent in their duties. In addition, in the countryside, there is the following budget for the harvest of agricultural products. For example, in the harvest of wheat (four bales), in addition to various national taxes, agricultural taxes, fertilizer costs, and food, from the remaining (one bale), frugal offerings, and then use barley or oats as food to maintain family life, until the victory of the Great War, true peace, and the comfort and happiness of the people are achieved. I am willing to be a sacrifice for the comfort and happiness of the Chinese and Japanese people and the peace of East Asia, and strive to defeat the imperialist warlords and plutocrats. This is my oath to my dear Chinese compatriots. The victory of the Chinese army is achieved through hard work. I think that the country's concerted efforts and frugal offerings are more important than anything else. Therefore, for frugal offerings, from now on, we must intensify our efforts to encourage and implement them. This is what I silently pray for and request in front of my Chinese compatriots. March of the 28th year of the Republic of China, respectfully written by Zhongshan Bao. (Dispatch from the 22nd)</p>

<h3>The National Government Officially Orders Preferential Treatment for Jiang Baili</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The National Government ordered on the 22nd: Jiang Fangzhen, a consultant of the Military Affairs Commission and acting president of the Army University, has a profound understanding of military strategy and has written extensively.

<h3>General Cheng Qian Was Never Injured</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The Japanese side claimed that when Japanese planes bombed Lanzhou on February 23, General Cheng Qian, the commander-in-chief of the Chinese Northwest Army, was injured and died of his injuries on Tuesday. It is said here that this is purely unfounded. According to responsible sources speaking to Reuters reporters, General Cheng Qian was not in Lanzhou on February 23, and Cheng was never injured in this battle. It is generally believed here that the origin of this statement is that when Japanese planes bombed Xi'an earlier this month, several bombs fell directly into Cheng's air-raid shelter, and the door of the shelter was bombed. After clearing the rubble, Cheng was able to leave the shelter. Due to the lack of air in the shelter, he felt slightly unwell, but was not injured. He soon returned to his office to work.

<h3>Hitler Arrives in Memel, Says Old Grievances Have Been Avenged, Germany and Lithuania Sign Transfer Agreement, Berlin Observes "Spring Movement" Completed</h3>
<p>Memel. Führer Hitler arrived off the port here this morning at 10:00 aboard the battleship "Deutschland", and immediately transferred to a destroyer to enter the port. When he landed, German troops were heavily guarded, and he was immediately greeted by Heinrich Himmler, head of the German political police, Interior Minister Frick, and Dr. Neumann, the leader of the German ethnic group in the Memel Autonomous Region. The Führer is scheduled to deliver a speech in the city center at 1:00 p.m. The entire city is flying the German flag to celebrate, and more than 30 German aircraft are circling over the city. (Havas dispatch from the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Members of the German mechanized police force and the National Socialist Party's security guards successively entered the Memel area last night. Interior Minister Frick arrived in the area this morning with many National Socialist Party leaders, and Neumann, the leader of the German ethnic group in the area, immediately went to welcome them and hold a handover ceremony. Frick and Neumann then stood side by side in a car and gave the National Socialist Party salute to the public. Following that, German army troops carrying artillery and anti-aircraft guns arrived. Residents of the Memel area generally cheered enthusiastically. Members of the National Socialist Party engineering corps, youth corps, and military bands then entered. The cruiser "Deutschland", with a squadron escorting Führer Hitler, also arrived outside the port of Memel. (Havas dispatch from the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Führer Hitler and Dr. Neumann, leader of the German ethnic group in the Memel area, recently delivered speeches to the local people in the city center of Memel, which were broadcast by the local radio station. Dr. Neumann said that the Memel area was opened up by Germans 700 years ago, and now it is fortunate that Führer Hitler has brought it back into German territory. Führer Hitler then replied, expressing his gratitude to the local people for not forgetting their motherland, and said that you were previously abandoned by the dim-witted German authorities, and now you have returned to your motherland. Our country has now decided to control its own destiny with its own strength. Although this is not welcomed by other countries, it is still ignored. The new Germany now has a population of 80 million, and you must be prepared to share its joys and sorrows. Based on our 20 years of experience, we know very well how the world treats us. The damage we have suffered in the past has now been started to be compensated, and the main part will be completed. (Havas dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Regarding the Memel Autonomous Region issue, the Lithuanian delegation, led by the country's Foreign Minister Ubšys, arrived here this afternoon at 4:30 in two planes, and was greeted by German Deputy Foreign Minister Weizsäcker and Director of Protocol Döenpe. After the delegation disembarked, they immediately went to the Foreign Ministry to hold talks with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, and then signed a treaty. The main points are: (1) Lithuania will return the Memel area to Germany; (2) Lithuanian troops and police will withdraw immediately; (3) The area will be opened as a free port for Lithuania's use; (4) Both parties agree to avoid the use of force and do not allow third countries to use violence against one of the signatory countries. (Havas dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Berlin) There is now a growing impression in political circles here that Germany's "spring movement" has now been completed. A Reuters correspondent learned that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and other important figures are now planning to rest temporarily until Hitler's birthday on April 20. Hitler is departing from the port of Swinemünde tonight aboard the German cruiser "Deutschland" to Memel. The reason for deciding to go by sea is to avoid setting foot on German lost territory, such as the Polish Corridor. (Reuters dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<h3>British Newspapers Reappear, French Newspapers Say There Will Be Endless Troubles</h3>
<p>(London) British newspapers attach great importance to Germany's annexation of Memel, saying that Hitler made a solemn promise last September not to make any more territorial demands in Europe. Now he has repeatedly broken his promises and Memel has finally been occupied. Although its method of annexation did not destroy Lithuania's sovereignty, and differed from that applied to Czechoslovakia, it did not ease the seriously tense situation. (Reuters dispatch from the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) The return of the Memel area to Germany has recently been commented on by various newspapers, which all said that German Führer Hitler's eastward plan is gradually being realized. The right-wing Paris Echo said, "After Germany annexes Memel, the encirclement of Poland is completed, the path to advance to the Soviet Union is opened up, and National Socialist Germany and Soviet Russia will soon be connected, which is a new situation in 20 years. From then on, sooner or later, the two countries, representing two races, two doctrines, and two concepts, will have a head-on conflict, which is only a matter of time, but the European political situation may be completely changed because of this." The right-wing Petit Journal said, "Memel's return to Germany is following the historical path and promoting the traditional eastward policy, because Germany has always had two paths for expansion, one progressing from the southeast Danube River and the other progressing to the northeast Baltic Sea." The right-wing Figaro said, "Germany is continuing to advance into Eastern Europe and has occupied new strongholds on the Baltic coast, which is enough to directly threaten Poland." The right-wing Temps said, "While England and France are working hard to establish a collective security system, Führer Hitler has replied." The moderate-wing Ordre said, "Germany's move will certainly be justified by upholding justice and fairness." The communist L'Humanité said, "If we look at the map of Europe and compare the position of Czechoslovakia after the Munich Agreement with the position of Poland after the return of the Memel area to Germany, we will find that Czechoslovakia constituted a protruding point at that time, which Germany could not tolerate. Now Poland has once again constituted a protruding point, which Germany is also unwilling to tolerate." (Havas dispatch from the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Romania and Hungary Ease Tensions</h3>
<p>Reserve Forces May Be Demobilized</p>
<p>Bucharest - According to sources in government circles here, Germany is attempting to ease tensions along the Hungarian-Romanian border. It is reported that Germany is applying pressure on Hungary to reduce the number of its troops on alert. If Hungary does so, Romania will follow suit. (Reuter, 23rd)</p>
<p>Romania - Prime Minister Armand Călinescu, in a recent statement to the press, said that the government's call-up of several classes of reservists was a precautionary measure. These troops have not been deployed near the border, nor will they be sent there. It is hoped that in ten days or half a month, the international situation will ease and they will be demobilized. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Belgium, Switzerland and the Netherlands Uneasy; Most Gold Shipped to London and New York</h3>
<p>(London) - Newspapers here recently reported that a Belgian plane carrying a large quantity of gold arrived here yesterday. More shipments are expected to arrive in the coming days. This is due to the Belgian authorities' desire to move the country's cash reserves to a safe location. The financial section of the Min Sheng Daily also reported that Switzerland and the Netherlands have also shipped most of their national reserves to London and New York for storage. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<h3>British Home Secretary Hoare Explains German Threat to Lithuania</h3>
<p>(London) - British Home Secretary Hoare, representing Prime Minister Chamberlain, explained today the circumstances of Germany's annexation of Memel. He said that Lithuanian Foreign Minister Urbšys, while in Berlin, received a demand that Lithuania cede Memel to Germany immediately. If Lithuania refused or sought help from elsewhere, Germany would take military action. If Lithuania accepted the demand, Germany would make no further demands. (Laughter in the audience.) This was tantamount to an ultimatum. It is reported that Lithuania has yielded. Since the demand was made, the Lithuanian government has not contacted the British government. Labour leader Henderson asked Hoare to note that Britain was a signatory to the 1924 Memel Convention and asked whether the British government intended to protest or take other action. Hoare replied that Prime Minister Chamberlain intended to make a more detailed statement and asked for patience. (Reuter, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Japan Holds Five-Minister Conference to Discuss New Diplomacy</h3>
<p>Arita Very Busy Again</p>
<p>Togo Meets Russian Foreign Minister Again</p>
<p>(Tokyo) - Well-informed sources here claim that the Japanese government may soon decide on a new diplomatic policy to cope with the situation created by Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia. The main topic of discussion at the five-minister conference held last night at Prime Minister Hiranuma's official residence was this issue. The five-minister conference lasted for four hours, adjourning at 12:30 AM. Attendees included Prime Minister Hiranuma, Foreign Minister Arita, Finance Minister Ishiwata, Army Minister Itagaki, and Navy Minister Yonai. It is reported that the conference will continue in the coming days, at which time Japan's new foreign policy will be formally decided.

After meeting with Harada, Arita held a secret discussion with Army Minister Itagaki. On Tuesday, Arita again met with Prime Minister Hiranuma to exchange views on diplomatic affairs, a conversation that lasted for an hour. This was followed by last night's five-minister conference. Arita has been active every day since Sunday. (Reuter, 23rd)</p>

The Italian Music Association, recently formed by Japanese musicians and singers studying music in Italy, is scheduled to hold a "Night of Italy" concert at the Hibiya Public Hall in Tokyo on April 2 to celebrate the establishment of the Italian-Japanese Cultural Agreement. Dr. Ishimoto, who gave a lecture at the University of Rome in Italy, hopes that a genuine Italian opera will be imported to Japan as a "direct result" of the cultural agreement. (Reuter, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Moscow) - Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Togo today held his twentieth meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov regarding the fisheries issue. According to sources here, the Japanese side still believes that a final resolution can be reached. It is reported that Togo told Litvinov he would participate in the fishing ground auction to be held in Vladivostok on April 3. The nature of the guarantees Togo requested is not yet known. (Reuter, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Moscow) - Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Togo visited Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov today and told foreign reporters that the Japanese government is willing to participate in the second fishing ground auction to be held in Vladivostok on April 3, but the Soviet Union must provide certain unspecified guarantees. It is understood that the Soviet Foreign Minister received the Japanese Ambassador and discussed the fisheries issue for 90 minutes, but there were no developments. At the first fishing ground auction held in Vladivostok on March 15, 293 fishing grounds were prepared for sale, but only four were sold. Of these, 255 had previously belonged to the Japanese side. The Japanese side did not send representatives to the previous auction. After the first auction, Japan protested to the Soviet Union against the unilateral auction of fishing grounds.

<h3>US Takes a Watchful Attitude Toward the European Situation</h3>
<p>Waiting for a Coalition of Democratic Nations</p>
<p>Revising the Neutrality Act</p>
<p>(Washington) - US political figures anticipated the return of the Memel Autonomous Region to Germany several days ago and were not surprised by the news. It is said that Führer Hitler will continue his usual tactics, and that after the Memel region, other areas may be sacrificed. Given this situation, the United States must revise the current Neutrality Act to help democratic nations. However, there is no need to rush the revision. Many commentators on the European situation say that the responsibility for restoring international security lies with Britain and France. The Christian Science Monitor said that today's United States in relation to Europe can be compared to Britain's position in relation to the European continent before 1914. Learning from the past, the US government should express its position as soon as possible. While public opinion is extremely hostile to dictatorships, there are widely divergent views on what role the United States should actually play. Broadly speaking, the current policy of the US government is to wait for Britain and other countries threatened by aggression to form a united front, while working to implement revisions to the current Neutrality Act. Only when the international situation takes a sudden turn for the worse and requires immediate action will the United States change its wait-and-see policy. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Washington) - The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has decided today to consider the new Neutrality Act amendment proposed by the committee chairman Pittman. (Associated Press, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Washington) - Regarding the Air Force expansion plan, the amendment recently passed by the Senate, which proposes spending $358,000,000 to build 3,532 military aircraft, bringing the total to 6,000, differs from the House of Representatives-passed bill, which also aims to increase the total to 6,000 aircraft (the original House bill proposed spending $300,000,000 to build 3,032 aircraft). Therefore, a joint conference will be held to discuss the matter and decide to use the Senate amendment as the basis. The two houses will then vote on it separately. Once the President signs it, it will become law. In addition, the Senate unanimously approved an additional appropriation of $116,539,287 to purchase urgently needed military equipment and strengthen the defenses of the Panama Canal. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>(New York) - Assistant Secretary of State Sayre gave a radio address to the nation tonight, stating, "The events that have taken place in Europe in the past week have proven that the situation the United States must deal with is whether democracy and civilization can continue to exist in the face of this totalitarian tide. Examining the beliefs of the German authorities, it seems they believe that promoting economic nationalism is enough to improve the living standards of their people, which is a fallacy." In short, if all-powerful nations follow their lead, and all notions of faith and moral principles, as well as international treaties, are no longer respected, which democratic nation can feel secure? Sooner or later, they will have to resort to force to resist aggression and curb brutality. (Havas, 22nd)</p>

<p>Upon recently reading in your newspaper that the German ships "Bremen" and "Europa," which sail the Atlantic route (Germany to the United States route), would be affected by the American boycott movement and suspended, we were deeply alarmed.

<h3>Poland in a Difficult Situation; Joint Declaration Difficult to Issue for the Time Being</h3>
<p>France's Written Reply to Us States Unreserved Participation Without Reservations</p>
<p>Soviet Attitude Also Ambiguous</p>
<p>(London) - French Foreign Minister Bonnet met with Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax for an hour and a half in the House of Commons this afternoon. Cadogan, a senior official from the British Foreign Office, Strang, the head of the Central European Division, Corbin, the French Ambassador, and Bréart de Boisanger, Bonnet's private secretary, were all present. According to responsible sources here, Foreign Minister Bonnet presented Prime Minister Chamberlain with a written answer regarding the issue of a collective security system in Eastern Europe, stating that France accepted the British draft joint declaration without reservations. Thus, in addition to maintaining mutual military assistance obligations, Britain and France will also have an obligation to automatically assist the Netherlands, Belgium, or Switzerland if they are attacked in Western Europe. In addition, the British and French governments have also provided Romania with concrete assurances that they will not stand idly by if the country is attacked. In the future, if a joint declaration can be issued with the Soviet Union and Poland, there will be a larger scope of restrictions in Eastern Europe. It is generally understood that although Poland has rejected the British proposal, British Ambassador Sir Kennard will still contact the Polish government tomorrow to persuade them to change their initial decision. It is particularly feared that Poland is unwilling to accept concrete restrictions on Romania, and is also hesitant to accept any restrictions in political or military terms due to the Soviet Union. Regarding this matter, Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck may make a decision after coming to London next month to hold talks with the British authorities, but this is not certain. As for the Soviet proposal to convene an international conference, Britain and France originally opposed it, but it is reported that they now intend to accept it. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) - Regarding the issue of a collective security system in Eastern Europe, after the British government proposed a draft joint declaration to France, Poland, and the Soviet Union, the Polish government refused to participate, while France expressed its approval without reservations. Soviet sources here claim that although the Soviet government has not yet submitted a formal answer, it is expected that it will be happy to join, and may request the adoption of more resolute language and stipulate more concrete restrictions for participating countries, but it is not certain. However, even if the Soviet Union makes this request, it will not make it a precondition. The British draft, it is understood, is extremely simple, stating that peace-loving countries must unite and immediately consult each other in the event of an emergency that endangers peace in Europe in order to "decide on steps to resist aggression." (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) - As for the British proposal for a joint declaration by Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and Poland, stating that they intend to deal with any future arbitrary actions by Germany in a united manner, the Soviet or Polish governments have not yet responded. It is claimed here that this declaration was only finalized on Monday, so the replies from the governments concerned, along with amendments, are unlikely to arrive in full within a few days. London is fully aware that Poland's position is different from other countries, so it expects the Polish government to raise objections. If a little delay allows the countries concerned time to agree on practical details, it may make this initial plan more concrete. (Reuter, 23rd)</p>
<p>(London) - Observers here generally believe that Poland's situation is difficult, and the sense of insecurity surrounding it has increased with the fate of Memel. If it now participates in a declaration unfavorable to Germany, it will certainly cause unpleasant consequences. It is believed that Germany respects Poland's position in Danzig and Pomerania solely because Poland does not closely participate in policies hostile to Germany. (Reuter, 22nd)</p>
<p>Warsaw - British Ambassador Sir Kennard visited Polish Foreign Minister Beck today. It seems that they discussed the British-proposed plan to issue a declaration against aggression. (Reuter, 22nd)</p>
<p>Warsaw - An official statement declares that Poland recognizes that the Baltic Sea region is related to Poland's direct interests. Sources here interpret this as a hint from Poland to Germany, namely that Poland will consider Germany's expansion of influence in Lithuania beyond Memel to be in conflict with Poland's interests. (Reuter, 23rd)</p>
<p>(London) - Regarding the issue of a collective security system in Eastern Europe, there are now two options: (1) Britain, France, and the Soviet Union issue a joint declaration first, and then invite other related countries to join; (2) Convene an international conference in London or Paris in the short term. Regarding this, the British government will make a decision tomorrow. Since Poland has refused to join, the Soviet government has delayed submitting a formal answer, and the Balkan countries seem unwilling to openly express their position unless Britain accepts more concrete restrictions, the British government has no choice but to reconsider the idea of convening an international conference. However, if the Soviet government can submit an answer tomorrow, unconditionally endorsing the original British plan, then the British government will still advocate that Britain, France, and the Soviet Union issue a joint declaration first, and then invite other countries to join through diplomatic channels. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) - Financial circles here recently stated that after Germany annexed the Bohemian and Moravian provinces of Czechoslovakia, the British government exchanged views with the governments concerned on the issue of a collective security system in Eastern Europe, so as to unite and resist aggression, and also decided to wage economic war against Germany, especially in the Balkans. In general, Britain should first make efforts towards Romania and send a commercial delegation to the country to promote the sale of British exports. If necessary, it may subsidize British exporters. In addition, Britain has only maintained its original economic position in Yugoslavia and Greece and has not competed with Germany. In the future, it will often change its strategy and compete with Germany with all its might. It will also do so in South America. Well-informed sources also said that German goods imported into Britain may be subject to additional tariffs, which is not impossible. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Chamberlain's Speech Still Leaves Room for Maneuver Regarding Germany</h3>
<p>(London) - Prime Minister Chamberlain stated the international situation in the House of Commons today, saying that the government has made it clear that the German government's recent actions have raised the question of whether Germany will, through constant effort, attempt to dominate all of Europe, or even more than that. If Germany does hold this intention, the British government feels it is important to declare that, as the past has shown, such an attempt will inevitably provoke effective resistance from freedom-loving Britain and other countries. He cannot disclose the results of recent developments and consultations with other governments now. He wishes to state that the British government does not want to obstruct Germany's efforts to expand its export trade through reasonable means. The British government also does not want to see the countries of Europe, with their differing ideologies regarding their internal administrative methods, form opposing camps. The only issue we are concerned about is that we cannot allow independent nations to be oppressed or threatened by force, and be forced to give up their independence. The Prime Minister concluded by saying that if anyone seeks to implement such procedures, we will resist them with all the means at our disposal. (Reuter, 23rd)</p>
<h3>British Parliament Welcomes French President</h3>
<p>A Historic First in British History</p>
<p>(London) - Members of both the House of Lords and the House of Commons welcomed French President Lebrun at 11:00 AM today. The British Parliament's welcoming of a foreign head of state is a historic first in British history. President Lebrun's visit is most important for this reason. When President Lebrun and his wife arrived at the Parliament, the crowd was overwhelming. The Speaker of the House of Lords, Lord Hailsham, the Speaker of the House of Commons, FitzRoy, and all members of Parliament were at the entrance to greet them. The band played the national anthems of France and Britain. Lord Hailsham then delivered a welcome speech on behalf of the House of Lords, saying, "The British Parliament is closely linked to British history. It is most fitting to welcome Your Excellency the President here. Your Excellency's visit to our country shows that our two countries are closely related. Our House is deeply honored." Speaker FitzRoy then delivered a welcome speech on behalf of the House of Commons, saying, "Many naval officers from your country visited our House in 1905 when the Entente Cordiale was established between Britain and France. Now, in this time of great events, Your Excellency is visiting our country as the head of the French Republic, that is, as the head of Britain's friendly nation and ally. All members of our House are deeply honored, and we sincerely welcome Your Excellency, just as Your Excellency sincerely invited our country. I am deeply aware that our two countries are prepared to work together to safeguard justice, freedom, and progress." Finally, President Lebrun delivered a reply, first expressing his gratitude to the Speakers of both Houses and all members of Parliament, saying, "The good relations between our two countries are due to the same ideas and common interests. Our two countries have worked together through both periods of peace and turmoil, and as a result, our relations have become increasingly advanced and have formed the traditional policy of our two countries. I am very pleased to be able to take this opportunity to solemnly reaffirm this." At that point, President Lebrun and his entourage slowly toured both Houses, had some light refreshments, and then left amidst cheers. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>(London) - French President Lebrun and his wife have been very busy with social engagements in recent days. Shops along the route they have taken have been flying the French flag to show their welcome. Even the poor have hung paper French flags in their windows. The enthusiasm of the public's welcome is evident. President Lebrun and his wife attended a reception hosted by the London County Council this afternoon. In the evening, the French Embassy hosted a banquet in honor of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, with guests including Queen Mary, Duke of Gloucester, Duke of Kent, Prime Minister Chamberlain, and more than 100 others. The seats were arranged in a horseshoe shape. King George VI wore the uniform of the Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Air Force, and Queen Elizabeth wore a white dress with the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor on her chest. They sat on either side of President Lebrun, while the President's wife sat to George VI's right. During the meal, the orchestra played various famous pieces to entertain the guests. Although no speeches were made, the atmosphere was very harmonious. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Brewing Negotiations Between France and Italy</h3>
<p>Speculation Surrounds Mussolini's Speech</p>
<p>Opening of the Italian Corporation Council</p>
<p>(London) There is much speculation in London that Mussolini will make colonial demands in his speech next Sunday. Some believe that now is not the time to make such demands. However, a Reuters reporter learned from well-informed sources that Mussolini will definitely declare Italy's demands, and will express them in resolute language. However, it is generally believed that Mussolini is a man of realism and will not make demands to France similar to the Austrian ultimatum, or make his demands in a way that would preclude the possibility of mutual consultation and resolution. It is rumored that certain French quarters are now eager to discuss matters with Mussolini. There have been many rumors about people acting as intermediaries between the two governments, which proves that the two governments are planning to engage in negotiations. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) Legal Adviser to the French Embassy in Italy, Mr. Lagatel, is an old friend of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. After returning to Beijing from Rome yesterday, it is widely rumored that he brought back proposals from the Italian government. Italy is willing to conduct negotiations with France to adjust relations between the two sides. Well-informed sources here have said that Lagatel did not bring back any proposals, and the rumors are not accurate. Although Lagatel is not a diplomat, former French Ambassador to Italy, Juvénal, represented France in the Four-Power Pact negotiations in 1933, and former Ambassador to Italy, Saint-Quentin, also contributed to the negotiations between France and Italy in 1935. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Rome) The opening ceremony of the Fascist Corporation Council (the legislative body that replaces the Chamber of Deputies) is scheduled to be held tomorrow. King Vittorio Emanuele III will preside over the ceremony in person and read out a decree. The 682 members will also take an oath together. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Fascist Corporation Council held its opening ceremony this morning. King Vittorio Emanuele III presided over the ceremony in person and read out a decree, first describing Italy's conquest of Abyssinia and the establishment of the Italian Empire. He then said, "The former League of Nations imposed sanctions on our country, and our country had no choice but to completely change its foreign policy. (Since October 1936, our government has established the closest cooperation with Germany in politics and economics. The Rome-Berlin Axis was announced at that time. This axis is vital to the survival of the two countries. With the establishment of the Anti-Comintern Pact, the cooperation between Germany and Italy has been extended to Japan, Hungary, and "Manchukuo"). As for our country's relations with other countries, our country signed an agreement with the United Kingdom on April 16 last year, thereby establishing a good foundation for lasting friendship. We also maintain friendly relations with Albania, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Poland, and Switzerland. (As for France, our government notified the country on December 17 last year to declare the abolition of the 1935 Franco-Italian Agreement and explained the various pending issues that temporarily separate the two sides). As for Spain, our volunteers fighting in that country are extremely brave and have made great contributions. From now on, we must cooperate with each other to the greatest possible extent. (In short, although our country does not believe that peace can last forever, it still hopes to maintain it as much as possible). One point must be stated: the pace of our country's military expansion cannot lag behind others. As for the financial situation of our country, although there have been difficulties in the past, thanks to the patriotic enthusiasm of the people, they have been overcome. (We must know that maintaining economic independence is a necessary condition for maintaining political independence. Therefore, our country must strive to get rid of foreign constraints in the economy)." Finally, the King concluded by saying, "I have great faith in the fate of our country and am willing to encourage it with the people." (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Rome) Political figures here are very interested in the decree read by King Vittorio Emanuele III at the Fascist Corporation Council today. They all say that the King did not specifically mention the differences between France and Italy, probably wanting to resolve the various pending issues through diplomatic channels. In addition, Prime Minister Mussolini is scheduled to deliver a speech on the 26th of this month. People generally believe that the Prime Minister will use moderate language because he does not want to create complications in the international community. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) The decree read by King Vittorio Emanuele III of Italy at the Fascist Corporation Council today has been commented on by well-informed sources here. The so-called notification of December 17 last year, which King Vittorio Emanuele III mentioned, is the notification declaring the abolition of the 1935 Franco-Italian Agreement. Foreign Minister Bonnet replied to it in a speech in the Chamber of Deputies on January 26 this year, and refuted the legal arguments adopted by Italy. According to the Italian government, the implementation of the 1935 Franco-Italian Agreement was conditional on the conclusion of a supplementary agreement between the two countries on the legal status of Italian residents in Tunisia. Since this supplementary agreement was not negotiated and concluded, and the approval procedures were not carried out as usual, the Italian government declared the abolition of the above agreement, which is fully justified in law. In addition, the Italian notification also stated that in order to improve relations between France and Italy, it is necessary to discuss the various pending issues anew. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>Bucharest, Romania The economic negotiations between Romania and Germany have been completed, and a supplementary trade agreement will be signed this afternoon. Foreign Minister Gafencu will issue a statement to the press afterwards to explain the content of the agreement. It is heard that this agreement does not contain any special measures, and Romania will still have full freedom in politics and economics in the future. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Economic Negotiations Between Germany and Romania - Once Interrupted, Suddenly Completed</h3>
<p>Romania's Freedom Unaffected</p>
<p>France and Romania to Conduct Negotiations</p>
<p>Bucharest, Romania The economic negotiations between Romania and Germany once reached a deadlock yesterday. Walter, a member of the German Ministry of Economic Affairs, was even said to be returning to his country. Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu held talks with German Minister Fabricius and Walter himself this afternoon for a long time. Economic experts from both sides also held meetings afterwards, which did not end until late at night. The situation was reportedly smooth, and a supplementary trade agreement is expected to be signed soon. Germany will also pressure Hungary to withdraw its military measures on the Romanian border. Regarding this, well-informed sources in Romania said that the Hungarian army has almost been fully mobilized. Romania has only increased the number of protection troops on the border. The Hungarian army must withdraw from the border before Romania can do the same. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Regarding the economic negotiations between Germany and Romania, the German Ministry of Economic Affairs sent senior official Walter to the Romanian capital to preside over the matter. It is learned that disputes have occurred several times regarding the sale of Romanian oil to Germany. Germany demanded that Romania sell 50% of its annual oil production to Germany. Romania, however, felt that such a large amount of oil was almost equal to the total amount of Romanian exports to Germany and considered it inconvenient to do so. After several compromises, the two sides reached a compromise plan the day before yesterday and scheduled to sign a supplementary trade agreement this afternoon. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Berlin) German Minister of Economic Affairs Funk gave a speech to members of the National Socialist Party in the town of Sensofen yesterday. He mentioned that some foreigners, due to recent events in Central Europe, have once again launched propaganda to put economic pressure on Germany. He strongly stated that no matter what the foreign views are, the political and economic power of a large country with 90 million people in Central Europe cannot be completely ignored by them and will inevitably have serious repercussions. The political aspect of Greater Germany has already achieved great success, and the economic aspect should also move forward in the same way. (Haitong, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) Well-informed sources recently announced that France and Romania will continue to conduct commercial negotiations here in the short term. Several Romanian experts will come here in the next few days to prepare everything. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>Hungary The commercial treaty between Hungary and Romania will expire at the end of this month. Representatives from both sides recently initialed an agreement here to extend the effective period of the current treaty until June 30 this year, and will conduct formal negotiations in June to sign a new commercial treaty. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<h3>A Week of War Situation</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission spoke about the war situation this week (March 16 to 22), saying that there were no large-scale battles on the northern and southern fronts this week. The Japanese army seems to be exhausted and is engaged in replenishment and adjustment, attempting to invade again in order to struggle for their dying lives. However, under the circumstances that our entire army is taking advantage of the gaps and consuming the enemy, the enemy has suffered extremely heavy damage, which is worth reporting. In terms of the overall war situation, it is as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong Front In recent times, the Japanese army has been frequently mobilized, which is purely a bluff. On the one hand, they are stepping up the construction of defensive works on the Yuehan, Zengcheng, and Conghua lines. They are rushing to repair gun emplacements in Haikou and Xiuying on Hainan Island, and are opening up aircraft warehouses and airports in Wenchang and Ding'an as bases for the air force, showing a look of being trapped and occupying for a long time. As for sporadic battles, our and the enemy's armies have successively engaged in fierce battles in Shunde, Daliang, Shengang, Ding'an, Wenchang, Qiongshan and other places. In the Battle of Qiongshan, the Japanese Colonel Motoda was killed in battle. Enemy planes also flew repeatedly to Daqiu, Lidong, Yingde, and other places to carry out indiscriminate bombing and blind bombing. Our losses were very small. At present, the enemy forces on all fronts are under our absolute control.</p>
<p>Northern Jiangxi Front The enemy army that invaded Lushan has been severely damaged by our army and has been quiet for many days. On the morning of the day before yesterday, a part of the enemy soldiers, under the cover of six airplanes, moved again toward the Good Man Slope, attempting to invade Guling. They were fiercely resisted by our defending troops, and more than 100 enemies were killed. Our artillery fired accurately and damaged two enemy planes. The enemy was defeated in embarrassment. The battle in Duchang is still very fierce. After our counterattack and recovery of the county seat, we continued to capture Dashishan on the 16th, and defeated the enemy who landed from the south of the city. The enemy's momentum was greatly frustrated. Another enemy force of 400 to 500 landed at Yejialiu on the opposite shore of the lake in Wucheng Town, southeast of Dean, attempting to spy on Wucheng in order to echo each other. They were subjected to our fierce artillery fire, and the enemy suffered heavy casualties. The enemy on the north bank of Xiushui fired more than a dozen shells at our Guanyinge and Gouziling from the afternoon of the 17th, most of which were tear gas shells. At night, more than 400 to 500 infantrymen crossed the river in the direction of Duma Village, Guanyinge, and Chen Village near the foot of the mountain, with a tendency to invade Tujiapu. After our valiant resistance, the battle was extremely fierce, and both sides suffered heavy casualties. They are still fighting.</p>
<p>Shanxi Front More than 1,000 enemies entrenched in Fushan, Jinxi, have suffered heavy casualties due to our continuous attacks in recent days. Some of them have fled west. More than 500 enemies remained in the city. On the afternoon of the 17th, our army launched a multi-pronged siege, and after several hours of fierce fighting, more than 300 enemies were killed. The remnants of the enemy could not hold out and fled to Linfen. At 7 p.m. that night, the county town was recovered. In An邑, Huoxian, Linjin, and other places in southern Jinxi, our and the enemy had repeated fierce battles. At noon on the 19th, during the siege of Linjin, Su Chaoqun's 1,000-man unit of the puppet imperial collaboration army, fully equipped with weapons, took the opportunity to revolt when our army approached the enemy's阵地. The enemy was attacked from the front and rear, killing and wounding more than 400 people, and has collapsed. Since the 11th, Shangxian has been recovered by our army. On the 19th, the enemy launched a counterattack. The artillery fire was extremely fierce. Our army fought desperately with the enemy all day long. The front lines of both sides went in and out several times. At the same time, another part of our army took advantage of the enemy's dispersed force and raided Jingle, annihilating more than 300 enemies in the northern area of the city. Jingle is still under our siege.</p>
<p>Henan Front The enemy army entrenched in Anyang and Shuizhi Town, attached to several cannons, led by Captain Yamamoto on the afternoon of the 19th, invaded us. They were resisted by our garrison and local teams. After three hours of fierce fighting, more than 200 enemies were killed, and Yamamoto was also killed at the same time. The remnants of the enemy could not hold out and fled in panic, and have now approached Shuizhi. On the 16th and 17th, the enemy army in Wenxian repeatedly bombarded Nanhedu, Fanshuigou, Fanshuicun, and the railway station in Gongxian. Our army fired back and suppressed the enemy. Another elite force of our army also attacked the enemy's rear on the north bank of the river. The enemy suffered heavy casualties, and the remnants fled in panic in the direction of Wushe and Qinyang. On the afternoon of the 19th, a part of the enemy invaded Laidongzhai in Zhongmu Northwest. After five hours of fierce fighting, the enemy was unable to hold out and fled. Our army took advantage of the victory and chased them to Liqiao, annihilating more than 100 defending enemies and recovering the area. On the morning of the 20th, the enemy dispatched a large number of reinforcements from Kaifeng to launch a fierce counterattack and released a large amount of poison gas. Because our army's陣地 was destroyed, we withdrew from Laidongzhai and fought fiercely with the enemy. In the evening, the enemy came like a tide. Because of the disparity in numbers, we temporarily withdrew from the寨. We are now actively deploying new front lines and reinforcements to counterattack.</p>
<p>Central Hubei Front Since the fall of Zhongxiang, the enemy army has been actively building the Hanyi, Jingzhong, and other roads, and is rushing to dye Yangzi "ten kilometers north of Zhongxiang" in order to engage in defense. Therefore, the war situation in this area has been quiet for the past week. However, the enemy army in Duoshi Bay has been constantly bombarding the opposite bank for days. Our army fired back and hit the enemy's powder magazine, causing heavy losses to the enemy. Another enemy at the Siduan Port crossing in Duoshi Bay tried to land on the west bank of the Xiang River in Zhangjia, Hongmiao, Wangjia, and other places on the 16th, 17th, and 18th. Our army severely attacked and killed a large number of enemies, and ultimately failed to succeed. At present, there are no enemy traces in these areas. Our and the enemy's armies are still engaged in artillery battles across the river, forming a stalemate. The enemy's attempt to solidify the eastern bank of the Xiang River will be difficult to achieve under the circumstances that our army is attacking from all sides.</p>
<p>Other Fronts Our army in Anhui Province has been attacking the enemy in Xiangshan for days. Our and the enemy's artillery fire is fierce, and the enemy's陣地 has been completely destroyed. An estimated 300 enemies have been killed. Another part of our army recovered Wangjiang County on the 16th, annihilating countless enemies. West of Xuzhou in Jiangsu Province, our army engaged in a fierce battle with more than 1,000 enemies at Huangkou Railway Station on the 19th, killing more than 200 enemies. The enemy fled in embarrassment to the Zhengjiazhuang area of Shanghui Town in Zhenjiang. More than 2,500 enemies surrounded us in eight directions. The defending soldiers resisted in separate directions, killing many enemies. The enemy was severely wounded and retreated. Through these several battles, the enemy's so-called sweeping plan has been completely shattered, and our army's strategy of turning the enemy's rear into the front seems to be successful in the not-too-distant future.

<h3>The Philippine Authorities Treat Overseas Chinese Harshly</h3>
<p>Conducting Full-Body Examinations on Those Entering the Country</p>
<p>Arbitrarily Taking Items Brought by Travelers</p>
<p>Philippine Correspondence, The Philippine Islands are made up of many islands in the Pacific Ocean. They originally belonged to the United States and were the United States' naval and air force base in the Far East. Since the United States Congress passed the Philippine Independence Act, the Philippines is nominally one of the independent countries in the world. Most of the overseas Chinese in the Philippines are engaged in business and labor. The number is considerable, mostly from Fujian Province in our country. Therefore, the Minnan language is almost comparable to the Filipino language in the Philippines and is widely spoken. After the United States promulgated the Immigration Law, the Philippines also had a ban on restricting Chinese workers. However, people who come to the Philippines for travel and short stays are not treated very badly. After the independence of the Philippine Islands, the Filipinos' treatment of the Chinese is very different. Here are a few notes on the treatment and feelings that the reporter has recently experienced in the Philippines, so that readers can know one aspect of the suffering of overseas Chinese abroad.</p>
<p>Very Strict Inspection</p>
<p>When entering the port of the Philippines, the Customs and Health Bureau sends people to board the ship to examine the body, the smallpox vaccination on both arms, the certificate of preventive injection, the trachoma of both eyes, and even all parts of the body. If any signs of disease are found, they will be imprisoned in the so-called "water house" water prison and expelled from the country by boat. After the examination of various parts of the body surface is approved, the stool must also be checked. If it is impossible to defecate temporarily, the examiners use a rubber tube to irrigate medicine and force the removal of feces. Passengers of the third and fourth classes must still be imprisoned on the ship for 24 hours after being approved by the Health Bureau before they can land.</p>
<p>Forced Fingerprinting</p>
<p>After landing, luggage cannot be carried with you and must be taken by customs for inspection, and you must immediately report to the Immigration Bureau. First, the export certificate (the certificate requested when returning home) is exchanged for a residence permit. The exchange procedure is extremely troublesome. First, you must take photos of the front and side faces and send them to the Immigration Bureau in person. The bureau will then, according to the new law, require the certificate holder to print fingerprints of all ten fingers on more than 30 pieces of various papers in person. If the bureau has not yet studied your procedures clearly, you will have to wait quietly for two or three weeks before you can receive your residence permit. However, the method of fingerprinting is specifically for Chinese people. I remember asking them in English at the time. Although the procedures are slightly easier for those who understand English, the method of abuse is still the same.</p>
<p>Various Demands</p>
<p>After the residence permit is issued, you can pick up your luggage from the customs. Regardless of size, it must be thoroughly inspected by customs officers. The purpose of the inspection is to check for tax evasion and contraband, but in fact, it is to check and find out whether there are any items in the luggage that can be taken for themselves. Fortunately, their desires are not high. No matter the size of the item or the fineness of the product, they take it for themselves whenever they have the opportunity. If one person is not enough, two or three people come to reach out for it without any scruples. The Jiangxi porcelain Buddha statues and other items that the reporter bought to send to relatives and friends were certainly taken away by them, and even the biscuits and fruits that were prepared for personal use were all taken away by people up and down. If the luggage is not plentiful and cannot satisfy their desires, at least they must get a cigarette, otherwise, they will make things difficult in every possible way, making people miserable.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Army's Southern Invasion Has Shown a Trend of Decline - The Chinese Army Prepares for a General Counter-offensive</h3>
<p>Wu, Yu, Wei, and Deng Appointed as Commanders-in-Chief</p>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence, After China's resistance to Japan turned to the second phase, there have been no major changes in the war zones in various regions for five months. However, the replenishment and training of troops in various war zones, the coordination and adjustment of personnel, and the expanded activities of political work are more active than before. As for the secret strengthening of the new air force, the precise organization of mechanized units, and the planning and improvement of transportation, there have been considerable achievements, which are enough to consolidate the front line of long-term resistance. However, the current overall strategy is to take the defense in the military and the offense in politics. This is what the supreme leader calls the importance of politics over military affairs and the importance of the rear over the front. The Southwest Military Conference held in Guilin the other day also followed this principle and has decided on various plans, and will descend on the east, south, west, and north lines.</p>
<p>Everyone Adjusts</p>
<p>Prepare to a certain extent, and then launch a full-scale general counter-offensive. Regarding the Huizhou-Chaozhou-Meizhou area on the eastern front, Commander-in-Chief Wu Qiwu is appointed as the commander-in-chief of the forward. Yu Hanmou, commander-in-chief of the northern section of the Guangdong Road on the northern front, is appointed as the commander-in-chief of the forward. Wei Yunsong, commander of the southern line of Gaozhou-Leizhou-Qinzhou-Lianzhou, is appointed as the commander-in-chief of the forward, while Commander-in-Chief Xia Wei is also in charge of planning the southwest lines. The southwest lines are the roads that the Japanese army must pass through to spy on Guangxi. Therefore, after the Guilin Conference, special attention was paid to all the elite troops that had completed training in Guangxi Province.</p>
<p>Elite Troops</p>
<p>Have been sent to the east as much as possible and deployed in the forefront of the first line of the southwest routes. Its second to third lines are also layered with well-arranged troops. Recently, the Central Government has also added the Fifth Mechanized Division to Guiliu, which shows that the national defense on the border between Guangdong and Guangxi is actually extremely sufficient. A senior military officer once said to people that before three or four months ago, after the abandonment of Guangzhou, if the Japanese army quickly advanced to the upper reaches of the West River, the western line might be shortened to a certain point. Now it is not the case, because the strength of the troops on each front line is stronger than before.</p>
<p>Strengthened Tenfold</p>
<p>And the four words "strengthen the walls and clear the fields" have also been implemented, and will not retreat a single step. Even if the Japanese army launches a full-scale invasion, taking another step deeper will be even more dangerous. We also look back at the Japanese army. In the past four or five months, the forward outposts have been stationed in the Gan崗, Mumian, and Jiaowei areas in the upper reaches of Sanshui, facing the Chinese army across the river, only more than 1,000 meters apart. Although they have repeatedly increased their troops, advancing and retreating, they have not dared to cross the river to advance half a step. The eastern line stops at Shilong, Boluo, Sucun, and Zhengguo, and the northern line stops at Huaxian, Xinjie, and Conghua Shangang. The outer defense line of Guangzhou seems to be smaller than two months ago, which shows that its troops are not enough to be allocated.</p>
<p>Southern Route</p>
<p>Since the occupation of Nanhai Island, its fleet has appeared from time to time on the coast of the Leizhou Peninsula and the northern ocean surface, and its purpose is nothing more than to pretend to seal off our coastline. Therefore, it is judged that the Japanese army still has no ability to penetrate into Guangxi. The southwestern war is in a stalemate. A diplomat once said that the Japanese side's strategy towards China has not changed the conspiracy to induce the Chinese side to submit and seek peace, but to arm the entire island of Hainan with all their energy, coupled with diplomatic means,</p>
<p>Threaten England and France</p>
<p>In order to eliminate the power of England and France to support China's resistance to Japan and promote the conspiracy to seek peace, the military in South China is temporarily adopting a defensive posture, unwilling to drive deep and make major consumption and sacrifices. Based on this strategy, the Japanese side only intends to protect its strongholds in the occupied areas of South China, support puppet organizations, and plunder the wealthy materials of South China for their own supply in order to maintain the situation of lingering on. The stagnation of the war lines in various routes in Guangdong is also due to this.</p>
<h3>Liang Han-ts'ao on China's Tactical Progress</h3>
<p>Japan, on the Other Hand, Is Increasingly Declining</p>
<p>Guilin Correspondence: Director Liang Han-ts'ao of the Political Department of the Southwest Headquarters, since arriving in Guilin on the 6th, has been busy attending reorganization and political work conferences. Recently, the conferences have concluded, and last night, this reporter had the opportunity to meet Director Liang. Director Liang, in his forties, appears very energetic and robust. This reporter asked him about his impressions of the reorganization and political work conference. Director Liang replied that the conference was very fruitful. The atmosphere was filled with unity and harmony. There was accurate criticism and detailed discussion of past work and future work plans. Regarding the political implementation of the second phase of the resistance, Director Liang expressed insightful opinions and expressed great optimism about the war of resistance. He said that Japan's war is one of decline, while China's war is one of progress. This is evident in all aspects. The consumption of Japanese military expenses and manpower has exceeded his budget infinitely, and the domestic economy has reached the brink of collapse. Japanese soldiers have lost faith in the stability of their own country's economy, which shows the general state of the domestic economy. Internationally speaking, democratic countries such as Britain and the United States are giving us loans, and the Soviet Union is also giving us practical help, as well as the sympathy and assistance of the world to our country, all of which are enough to make Japan's international status increasingly isolated. Speaking of the future political work in the Southwest, Director Liang already has a complete plan for this. He is now preparing to train a large number of unemployed and out-of-school youths to go to the army to intensify the political work of the army, while isolating soldiers from combat, and expanding the army. In short, the war of resistance has entered the second stage, and China's new strength is growing, while Japan's clay feet have fallen into an irrecoverable abyss.</p>

<p>Passing of Proposals on Frontier Education and Overseas Chinese Education</p>
<p>The resolution on the principle of frontier education was passed as a proposal for improving frontier education. However, the following points must be changed: (1) Frontier education should take the integration of the cultures of all parts of the Greater Chinese nation and promote their development as a fixed guideline.

<p>Today, Wu Dingxin, Wang Maozu, Guo Weibai, Zhou Shang, Li Zheng, Luo Jialun, and twenty-two others made a temporary motion, "Accepting President Chiang's address at this conference as the highest guiding principle for our country's education in the future." The resolution was passed. The text of the original proposal is as follows:</p>
<p>"At the third plenary session of this conference, President Chiang personally delivered an address, with great foresight and meticulous details. The points he indicated are indeed the golden rule for education at present. This conference unanimously accepts it as the highest guiding principle for our country's education in the future, and strives to promote and implement its implementation plan. Please ask the Ministry of Education to formulate and issue circulars for implementation. Is this appropriate? Please decide by public vote."</p>

<h3>International Cup and Scorto Cup Two Champions to Play Charity Match</h3>
<p>The Most Difficult Thing Is Negotiating the Venue</p>
<p>Will Be the Most Exciting Performance of the Season</p>
<p>Recently, the Portuguese football team, which won the International Cup, initiated a charity match between this year's International Cup champion Portuguese team and the Scorto Cup champion Lido team for the sake of more charitable provincial gatherings, with the proceeds used for charity. After that, it will follow the "Macklin Engineering Cup" and hold a regular match between the two national cup champions every year. It is reported that if the Shanghai English-language Damei Evening News can mature this matter, it is willing to donate a huge silver shield as a souvenir for the winning team, which they will keep for one year. Currently, Mr. Sossos, the manager of the Portuguese team, has expressed his intention to Lido, and both parties have agreed. The venue is intended to be the Yiyuan Garden, but the venue is now closed, and efforts are being made to find a solution. However, it is not known whether it will be possible. As for the date of the match, it will be held in the shortest possible time as soon as the venue is determined. According to both sides' strength, they are strong and can be called the second most difficult in the Chinese and Western football teams. If this matter can be completed, it will not only help the refugees and football fans, but also add a different color to the football world.</p>
<h3>Western Union Football Cup Matches End Lido Wins Junior Cup</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a 5-1 Thrashing of the Survey Team</p>
<p>The final of the Western Union Junior Cup football match, Lido vs. British Army Survey Team, was held at Jiaozhou Park at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. No less than 3,000 spectators watched the match, and the atmosphere was very enthusiastic. Lido's victory over the Survey Team after winning the Scorto Cup was expected. Therefore, Zheng Tongyu and Yun Feng were sent to the battle. Zheng's performance was good, while Yun was relatively weak. The Survey Team knew that they would be defeated, so they were determined to fight to the death. Sure enough, they scored a goal first, but it was only a flash in the pan. In the first half, the Survey Team was behind 1-2. In the second half, Lido controlled the overall situation and scored three more goals. As a result, Lido defeated the Survey Team 5-1 and won the championship. After the match, Mr. Hu Xiansheng, a member of the league's appeals committee, supported the award, and Lido team captain Li Yichen received it. The Junior Cup, which was held by Bei Xitong in the previous year, returned to the hands of the Chinese team, and all the cup matches in this year also came to an end. The lineups of both sides in yesterday's match are as follows:</p>
<p>Lido</p>
<p>Zheng Tongyu, Li Yichen, Zhang Lingen, Yun Feng, Tan Fuzhen, Meng Yiliang, Cao Qiuting, Sun Jinshun, Wang Kehou, Xu Wenkui, Zhang Mingsheng</p>
<p>Survey Team</p>
<p>Evans, Brown, Haemilin, Dixon, Simpson, Chetmanns, Ferguson, Wea, Cliveley, Fermisth, Harwest</p>
<p>Survey Team Opens the Record</p>
<p>Lido played against the wind first and failed to penetrate deeply. Zhang Mingsheng entered from the right and hooked Xu Wenkui, who shot out of bounds. The Survey Team's Harwest took the opportunity to attack. Li Yichen blocked and slipped. Meng Yiliang touched it into a corner kick. Ha's kick was very good. Zheng Tongyu jumped out and saved it. The iron leg headed it out obliquely. Harwest swept it again and was caught. Cao Qiuting then attacked twice, but failed to score. After 15 minutes, Fermisth high-pitched the ball towards the goal. The ball drifted downwind. Zheng Tongyu's save was unstable and slipped into the net. The Survey Team took the lead by one goal. Before long, Xu Wenkui scored a shot from Sun Jinshun's pass, but it was offside and abandoned. Lido launched another siege and had many good opportunities, but all were missed. At 23 minutes, Zhang Mingsheng passed to Sun Iron Leg, who passed it to the left. Cao Qiuting rushed up and shot quickly, and the ball bounced in from the crossbar, tying the score at 1-1. At this point, Lido's offensive was even stronger, and the Survey Team was difficult to resist. Finally, at 41 minutes, Haemilin committed a foul for pulling someone, and was penalized a 12-yard penalty, which was executed by Sun Jinshun. The iron leg started, and the goal was scored in response. The first half ended, with Lido leading 2-1.</p>
<p>Lido Wins the Championship</p>
<p>After the break, Sun Jinshun and Wang Kehou exchanged positions, which was even more successful. Lido tilted its troops to attack, and the ball often hovered in the Survey Team's hinterland. Iron Leg got Xu Wenkui's help to shoot, but was blocked by Evans into a corner kick. Zhang Mingsheng's opening was ineffective. Cao Qiuting crossed from the left, Wang Kehou jumped up and missed. Iron Leg was about to shoot, but Simpson had returned to save it, and it became a corner kick. Cao Qiuting's opening was blocked again. After 12 minutes, Sun Iron Leg scored a low sweep from Qiuting's hook at the 12-yard mark. Then, Xu Wenkui's shot was caught. Iron Leg shot twice, but both bounced back from the enemy general. Seeing the opportunity, Harwist secretly crossed the warehouse. After Li Yichen blocked it, he entered Fermith's feet. Fei Mengkou, Zheng Tongyu fell to the ground with a扑, picked it up and threw it away, which was very dangerous. After 22 minutes, Xu Wenkui scored a goal at the 20-yard mark, making it 4-1. Then Harwist kicked a free kick. Tan Fuzhen missed a foot, Zheng Tongyu扑空, Zhang Lingen补进钩出, but it had passed the white line, the referee did not notice, and Lido was spared. After that, Iron Leg had a wonderful shot, but it hit the post. Finally, half a minute before the end, Xu Wenkui scored another goal at the 25-yard mark. The silver whistle sounded long, and Lido won 5-1.</p>
<h3>Tonight, Western Youth Volleyball at Paramount</h3>

Huang Jiajun, a former famous player from the Fudan Volleyball Team, also arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong last Sunday to help Paramount. Huang has represented this city and Guangdong in the National Games, and has also appeared in the Hongyi Cup. His ball skills have reached the realm of perfection.

<h3>Zhang Zhihong Wins Championship in Jingwu Cup Table Tennis Sixth Group</h3>
<p>Feng Qingxun's Efforts Failed</p>
<p>In the Jingwu Cup All-Shanghai Individual Table Tennis Tournament, the elimination round of the sixth group was held yesterday. Because the talents in this group were average, the battle was extremely tense. Cui Chengqiu, the sixth in the previous session, seemed to have become unfamiliar with his ball skills and was unfortunately defeated by Feng Qingxun, the champion of the Qianye Cup individual tournament. In the semi-finals, Feng used his steady counter-draw to defeat Liu Longzhou, a veteran of Siming, and won the right to the finals. Zhang Zhihong, the seeded staff member of this group, entered the first and second rounds with hard battles. Feng was able to cheer up, but in the three games, he could win but did not win, so his efforts failed. Alas. As a result, Zhang finally relied on his experience to win the championship of this group. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>Feng Qingxun won Cui Chengqiu 3-0, Liu Longzhou won Ni Chunbing 3-0.</p>
<p>Feng Qingxun won Liu Longzhou 3-2.</p>
<p>Zhang Zhihong won He Ming 3-1, Li Shanglu won Mao Delin 3-1.</p>
<p>Zhang Zhihong won Li Shanglu 3-0.</p>
<p>Zhang Zhihong won Feng Qingxun 3-1.</p>

<h3>Finance: Northern Gang Turns from Buying to Selling, Spot Prices Suddenly Fall Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot market situation of 烚赤 (shā chì - a type of gold) was suddenly weak again. This was due to the weakening buying interest of the Hong Kong Gang and the Northern Gang turning from buying to selling. The situation on the day was weak first and then strong, and the entire situation was shifted by supply and demand. At first, due to the large amount of selling by the securities gangs and the weak buying force of a certain silver house, it tended to go downstream. The lowest price once fell to 2,068 yuan. However, soon after, gold shops, a certain bank, and a certain broker all took advantage of the low price and rushed to buy, causing the price to rush out of the 2,070 yuan mark. Later, as supply and demand became scarce, the situation gradually stabilized. As a result, the price fell by 9.5 yuan. People were still calm, and transactions were not active, about 600 taels. The price of silver jewelry also fell first and then rebounded, and finally rose by a small 1 yuan. The price of customs gold and Sino-British pure gold did not change.</p>
<h3>烚赤 Falls by 9.5 Yuan</h3>
<p>From the morning, each bar (ten taels), the initial opening was due to people's slightly weaker sentiment and the securities gangs' selling intentions were strong, so most of the people at that time were waiting and watching. As a result, the price was shouted down from 2,085-6 yuan to 75 yuan, before it was opened. First, a gold shop sold 50 taels to a certain silver house, with the opening price of 2,075 yuan, which was 11 yuan lower than the previous day. After the opening, a certain silver house absorbed 50 taels from the securities gang, 73 yuan. Then, the securities gang sold 50 taels to a certain bank, with a price of 70 yuan, and then sold 50 taels to a gold shop, 68 yuan. After this, the securities gangs stopped selling and watched, so it moved upward. A gold shop bought 50 taels from a silver house gang, 75 yuan. Then, a certain money exchange industry suddenly came to sell, selling 50 taels to the same industry, 78 yuan, and then selling 50 taels to a certain bank, with a price of 77 yuan. Later, another money exchange industry followed suit and sold 50 taels to a certain broker, with a price of 76 yuan, and 50 taels to a silver house gang, with a price of 74 yuan. At that time, the money exchange industry also sold 50 taels to the silver house gang, with a price of 72 yuan. It was heard that the US exchange rate was slightly weak, so the price rose again. The money exchange industry bought 50 taels from the silver house gang, with the closing price of 76 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, the market situation turned dull, and the price was also stable, and the transaction was very sparse. Only the gold shop absorbed 50 taels from the money exchange industry, 76 yuan, and then bought 50 taels from the money exchange industry, 76.5 yuan. After this, the buyer shouted 78 yuan, but the seller had to supply 79 yuan. The two sides held on until 4 o'clock and did not open, so the closing price in the evening was still 2,076.5 yuan. As a result, the price fell by 9.5 yuan compared to the previous closing. The difference for the day was 10 yuan. The selling price of the current brand gold of the cash shop was 2,085 yuan, and the purchase price was 2,070 yuan. The current standard gold is about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold.</p>
<h3>Jewelry Gold Down 1 Yuan</h3>
<p>The initial selling price of silver jewelry in silver houses did not change. At 10 o'clock, due to the potential weakness of 烚赤, the price was also lowered by a small 2 yuan. Later, at noon, due to the slightly stronger situation of 烚赤, the price also rose by 1 yuan. As a result, Datonghang changed to 211 yuan, Xintonghang was 209 yuan, and the purchase price was 203 yuan.</p>
<h3>British Pure Gold Unchanged</h3>
<p>On the 22nd, the price of British pure gold in London did not change, remaining at 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 5 pence per ounce, so the China Advanced Purchase Price of the Central Bank also remained at 1,211.6 yuan. The listed customs gold also did not change, calculated at 2 yuan, 3 cents, 9 and 4 mils. The Shanghai standard gold price was also calculated at 1,206.9 yuan.</p>
<h3>英美金票獨升</h3>
<p>Yesterday, unalloyed British gold remained unchanged. The British-American exchange rate fell back to 0.0625. Foreign exchange in this port and settlements by foreign firms were slightly more prosperous. Supply from Hong Kong Electricity and banks was not weak, suggesting latent stability. However, due to the tightness between Britain and America, the British exchange rate was flat while the American exchange rate was slightly weak. During the opening of transactions involving silver bullion, there was a sudden appearance of weakness. Retail investors took advantage of the high prices to sell and lock in profits. Although customer assistance was very smooth, with a temporary rebound, the demand could not match the supply, thus trending downward again. In the afternoon, people were distracted and transactions suddenly became scarce, with no opportunities for speculation, and the trend was sideways. Due to the stability of exchange rates, sentiment regarding silver bullion was distracted and transactions were very few. Only British and American gold notes experienced some demand, trending slightly upward. Other currencies showed no gains or losses. There were no transactions on the exchange. Yesterday’s market prices showed only a five-point increase in British gold notes and a one-point increase in American gold notes. All other currencies remained unchanged.</p>

<h3>英匯穩定美匯緊</h3>
<p>Yesterday’s exchange market was fairly stable because although foreign firms bought, Hong Kong Electric continued to sell, and foreign banks also supplied actively. The American exchange rate softened slightly due to the slight weakness in the British-American exchange rate and the sellers' reluctance to supply. There was little change on the day, and transactions were also light. The Hong Kong exchange rate continued to trend cheaper due to the efforts of money exchangers to sell.</p>
<p>At the start of the morning, London silver bars for spot and forward deliveries were shrinking by 0.0625. New York silver prices remained flat, and London gold also showed no change. There were no changes in the exchange rates of British, French, and Shanghai currencies. The US dollar fell by 0.0625 against the British pound, dropped by 0.125 against the French franc, and remained unchanged against the Shanghai currency. The central government's listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's opening selling prices were 8.28125 for the British exchange rate and $18.1875 for the American exchange rate, both flat compared to the previous closing. After opening, although foreign firms settled frequently, the Hong Kong Electric continued to sell, and foreign banks supplied heavily, resulting in a lack of changes. Foreign firms settled with Hong Kong Electric, and Mercantile Bank’s British exchange rate was 8.28125. HSBC's listed price remained unchanged, and the silver balancing tax was further reduced by half a cent, calculated at 4.50%. Afterwards, foreign firms purchased the American exchange rate from Banque Belge pour l'Etranger at $16.1875, followed by Chinese banks trading the American exchange rate at $16.15625, showing a slight softening. Near noon, money exchangers suddenly aggressively sold Hong Kong currency, causing the situation to loosen. Hong Kong currency was sold to foreign firms, rising from $55.375 to half a dollar. At the noon close, the bank's selling prices were 8.28125 for the British exchange rate and $16.15625 for the American exchange rate.</p>

<p>Industrial and Commercial Discussions</p>
<h3>Why is Spring Coal Rising?</h3>
<p>— Pei Ben</p>
<p>Fragrant flowers and charming people, spring returns to the earth. In previous years, the coal market, upon reaching springtime, would open with a red banner, transactions would gradually clear, and coal prices would also return to relaxation. Unexpectedly, this year, the times are extraordinary. Since the new year, the transactions of bituminous and anthracite coal have not been particularly prosperous, but the prices have been rising steadily, with no falls, rising by two or three dollars. This situation is not only a mystery to outsiders but also seen as unexpected and unfathomable even among industry insiders.</p>
<p>However, the cause lies in the autumn of last year. The coal firms and factories in this port, considering the inconvenient transportation and obstructed supply of domestic coal mines, realized that although the British Kailan Mining Administration had a large output, the supply was intermittent and unreliable due to a certain special force. They anticipated that the coal supply would be lacking in the coming winter and that foreign coal would be necessary. Therefore, they flocked to foreign countries such as India and Australia to make large purchases. Foreign firms, seeing the potential for profit, established "coal departments" one after another to pre-order on behalf of customers and peddled everywhere. As a result, regardless of outsiders or industry insiders, they believed that there was a way to make money and that rare goods were available, scrambling to be first, fearing to be late. This led to an unprecedented import volume last winter. In a few months, more than 200,000 tons of foreign coal were imported. At the same time, a large amount of Kailan coal also poured in to supply users. As a result, the goods were abundant, sales declined, and promotion was difficult. As the end of the lunar year approached, and the general financial conditions tightened, some had to painfully cut prices to quickly sell out. Therefore, except for those who were quick to act and had lower costs, who were still able to gain small profits, most others suffered losses due to tight exchange rates and soaring water transportation costs. It is said that a certain coal firm in this port lost more than 100,000 dollars due to ordering Australian coal. The magnitude of the swings can be imagined. Consequently, the coal firms, having suffered these blows, learned from the past and felt negative about ordering foreign coal. This is why the arrival of goods has been scarce in recent months.</p>
<p>It was not until the opening of the new year that, although the accumulation of bituminous coal had gradually thinned and the supply was insufficient to meet the demand, sales were not strong, and they maintained a stable trend. Recently, due to the clandestine sales of Kailan coal, the sales office charged an additional four dollars, causing other goods to increase uniformly, presenting an abnormal price increase. As for stove anthracite, the season has passed, but because the source is not wide and the industry also has unreleased storage documents in hand, it is still strong. Once a large number of goods arrive, the price will return to relaxation, which can be predicted.</p>
<h3>Securities: Securities Unable to Lift Their Heads, Same for Far East Stocks, All Because of the Perilous European Situation</h3>
<p>Yesterday's off-market securities trading showed signs of being unable to lift its head, due to the high price increases the previous day, resulting in a reversal. The surface appearance seemed quite weak, and the generally poor situation in Zhejiang caused market sentiment to appear confused. Yesterday's process saw prices initially high and then low, and then low and then high in the afternoon, but the overall market price did not rise or fall at all. The buying and selling sides' lines remained as such: Xinfeng Yongshou consistently bought, while Defu Tiansheng Tongde Renchang and other firms also had intake. The selling side saw Dafeng and Tongkang and other firms release long positions, while Weisi No. 4 and No. 20, as well as Lianhe, sold in the morning. Zhongyi No. 1 and No. 5 also sold in the afternoon, so the market price ultimately failed to rise despite repeated attempts to raise it. Although the bulls tried to pull the market up at the close, they were surrounded by bears, so the number of optimists was small. As a result, the market price was exactly the same as the previous day, with absolutely no rise or fall, which is also quite coincidental. The total turnover was estimated at around six or seven hundred thousand dollars. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category Highest Lowest Closing Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>Unified A 5770 5730 5745 No change</p>
<p>Unified B 5180 5145 5150 Ditto</p>
<p>Unified C 5140 5100 5115 Ditto</p>
<p>Unified D 5030 4980 4990 Ditto</p>
<p>Unified E 5040 499 — 5015 Ditto</p>
<p>96 660 — 660 Ditto</p>
<p>In stock trading, about 80 shares of China General Edison changed hands at a price of $5.40, which is currently under negotiation. It is said that the market price is slightly trending higher.</p>
<p>London's listed prices for Chinese foreign currency bonds on the 22nd of this month (Wednesday) were still stable. Only the Guangdong-Kowloon Railway bonds continued to fall by one pound, with a price of 20 pounds. All others remained unchanged. The actual supply of British goods included 20 pounds of British gold indemnity bonds for the restoration of Russia, with a selling price of 46 and a half pounds, and 20 pounds of German-issued Hukuang Railway bonds, with a selling price of 20 and a half pounds, an increase of 2.5 pounds compared to the market.</p>
<p>London's listed prices for British Far East company stocks on the 22nd of this month (Wednesday) fell again due to the renewed tightening of the European situation. Mercantile Bank shares fell slightly by two shillings and six pence, with a price of eight pounds and ten shillings. HSBC's British-registered shares fell by one and a half pounds, and Hong Kong-registered shares fell by half a pound, with both market prices at 83 and a half pounds. Kailan Mining shares fell by nine pence, with a price of sixteen shillings and nine pence. All others remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Few Transactions of Coarse Granulated White Sugar</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market tended to be flat and soft, with few transactions. The Exchange's assigned price for coarse granulated white sugar for re-export was $16.575, with only 100 bags changing hands. The current prices for spot and Taikoo sugar were maintained, with no transactions. A little domestic sugar was released, with more than 80 bags of Huizhou white sugar at $23.10, 30-40 bags of ordinary Huanggang Qing sugar at $14.90, and dozens of bags of cotton red sugar at $15.2-3.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 720 bags of sugar were transported from Hong Kong, and 500 bags came from Shantou.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Wenzhou Dried Shrimp Not Weak, Shantou Golden Hook Has Been Out of Stock for a Long Time</h3>
<p>Recently, the outflow of Wenzhou dried shrimp from this street has been not weak, and the Tianjin group has resumed operations, with a firm trend. Yesterday's list price opened at $61.50, up $4 from before.</p>
<p>Shantou golden hook shrimp has been out of stock for a long time. It has been found that the base here is scarce, and the quality is also dry. The current market is advancing, and the price is $92 for five units.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials: Supply of Job's Tears Interrupted, All Because of Difficult Transportation</h3>
<p>Job's tears (i.e. rice kernels) are produced in Jiangbei. Recently, due to the unrest in the area, transportation is difficult, resulting in the interruption of the supply. The goods in stock have also dwindled. The previous market price was $50 per picul, and today some are calling for $60, with a fairly strong trend.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Banks Dump Goods, Double Horse Yarn Plunges by More Than $2, Tianjin Purchases of Coarse Yarn Are Still Smooth</h3>
<p>Yesterday's yarn market, which had fallen sharply the previous day, turned to a recovery due to the easing situation in eastern Zhejiang and more stable sentiment. Wenzhou merchants resumed buying of 42-count double-strand yarn, and Shanghai-Ningbo shipping continued to operate normally, but the demand was very shallow. As a result, buyers resumed activity, but the demand from South China was relatively sluggish, and very little was purchased. However, the Tianjin merchants from the north purchased coarse yarn quite smoothly, and sentiment was supported. However, the hoarders' Continental Bank had purchased a large amount of 20-count Double Horse yarn, totaling several thousand bales, at over $400. Due to the poor prison environment, they have already begun to sell at a loss. As a result, the market price was soft. In the afternoon, Changtai represented Continental Bank and again released files, reportedly about 400 bales, with a price of only $386 to $386.5, down $2.00, $1.75 to $2.25 from the previous market.</p>
<p>The current yarn situation: At the opening of the morning market, because Ningbo was still very stable, the Shanghai-Ningbo route was not blocked, and Haikou was bombed without affecting it, sentiment was revived, and the air of nervousness dissipated. The opening price increased by $0.50, and the current price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was $387. Several dozen bales were transacted among peers. However, customer demand was inactive. Subsequently, buyers became active, gradually increasing the price. Finally, the price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was $388.20, and warehouse receipts were also made to $7. In the afternoon, the market atmosphere suddenly changed, and Continental Bank suddenly released goods, about several hundred bales, with the selling price falling by $2. However, there were not many customers, and the brokers fought, with a chaotic state, mostly speculative in nature. Only a few dozen bales were transacted at the price of $386, and shortly afterwards it reached $386.5. Apart from this batch of transactions, there was no other business. The industry was static and did not act. It has been found that the total number of purchases from all groups for the day was 1,905 bales. The market was generally similar to the previous day, but 32-count Tiannv yarn fell by $5. The factory released 60 bales of 10-count Double Globe yarn from the Xinyu factory, with a price of $292. Today, 1,110 pieces of cotton yarn were exported to Shantou, and 90 pieces were exported to Hong Kong. The quantity purchased by each group is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Peers 1,080 Ningbo 5 Wenzhou 30</p>
<p>Mainland 80 Yunnan 155 Hong Kong 5</p>
<p>(Tianjin) 535 Jiangxi 5</p>
<p>Xiamen 5 Total 1,905</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market was still plain and unremarkable, with a slightly softened appearance, because actual demand was not strong, but the major players were still in a bullish position. The spot price of 20-count Shuiyue yarn was $339 to $340, and the current price of 20-count Lanfeng yarn was $329 to $330, with little change from the previous day.</p>
<h3>Indian Cotton Fails to Arrive in Shanghai on Schedule, American Cotton Transactions Become Active</h3>
<p>Firewood Machine Cotton Reaches Peak of $72.20</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton Market Prices: The New York cotton market felt quite tired. Washington still has no definite news regarding the disposal of stored cotton. Yesterday, due to the sell-off in Wall Street and the closure of long positions, it fell another six or seven points. Indian cotton, including forecasts, fell by more than half a rupee, and Egyptian cotton fell by more than twenty points. This morning's telegrams said that the European situation has stabilized, and it is expected that overseas cotton markets may have a consistent rebound today. Yesterday, exchange rates were looser, converted to legal currency, and cotton prices all fell. It is estimated that American and Indian cotton fell by $0.60 per picul, Indian cotton fell by $0.30, and Egyptian cotton fell by $1.20.</p>
<p>The Shanghai market for foreign cotton transactions became quiet again today, due to the failure of yarn prices to improve. Due to the extremely low water transportation costs and the difficulty in transporting goods, the goods previously ordered by various factories could not be transported on schedule. Therefore, there has been little interest in Indian cotton recently. However, the transactions of American cotton have become active, but due to the inability to release the loan cotton immediately, the purchase of cotton cannot be carried out at will, so the transaction volume has not been large. Yesterday, only Hongzhang imported 500 bales of American cotton, and it was stated at the time that this cotton needs to arrive in Shanghai in mid-May. It is not known whether it can be transported to Shanghai at that time. The prices of foreign cotton yesterday are listed below:</p>
<p>Raw Material Category Delivered to Factory Including Tax</p>
<p>60-count Egyptian Cotton Premium $106.65</p>
<p>Also Also Medium $103.65</p>
<p>80-count Also Premium $130.05</p>
<p>Also Also Medium $29.90</p>
<p>20-count American Mitterlin $83.90</p>
<p>Also Also Low Grade $70.85</p>
<p>32-count Also $92.60</p>
<p>Also Also Low Grade $81.75</p>
<p>42-count Also $94.40</p>
<p>Also Also Low Grade $82.65</p>
<p>Also South American Brazilian Cotton Premium $88.20</p>
<p>Also Also Medium $84.90</p>
<p>Also Also Low Grade $75.80</p>
<p>10-count Indian Pingguoer $61.80</p>
<p>16-count Indian Omura $64.40</p>
<p>20-count Also $72.15</p>
<p>24-count Indian Bairoch $79.50</p>
<p>32-count American Xint $84.65</p>
<p>32/42-count American Pengapur $89.10</p>
<p>The domestic cotton business has slightly improved, with more active transactions, but although the number of transactions is high, the volume is weak. It is because the price is too high, and the factories' buying interest is not strong. Buyers really have no choice but to adopt the need to mix in Indian cotton, which is bright in color. Recently, with the decline in foreign cotton prices, Chinese and foreign factories have shifted their focus to Indian and American cotton and are starting to proceed. Yesterday, firewood machine cotton reached a new high of $72.20, up another $0.25. The remaining prices were not much different from the previous day. 2,800 bales of Zhejiang cotton arrived, and only 60 bales of Nantong cotton from northern Jiangsu arrived in Shanghai. The current cotton transaction volume and market list are listed on the left:</p>
<p>Xiasha Cotton $77.50 Sanyi purchased 128 bales Exchange Warehouse Delivery</p>
<p>Firewood Machine Cotton $71.50 Xiehe purchased 140 bales Cash Also</p>
<p>Changyinsha Packaged $78.00 Peers purchased 102 bales Tax-Free Also</p>
<p>American Packaged $85.00 Also 97 pieces Exchange Also</p>
<p>Firewood Machine Cotton $72.25 Also 120 bales Cash Also</p>
<p>Yaoyi $67.00 Xinhe Factory purchased 1,000 bales Exchange Factory Delivery</p>
<p>Second-Grade White Cotton $71.00 Yuda purchased 320 bales Also Warehouse Delivery</p>
<p>Firewood Machine Packaged $77.00 Peers purchased 102 bales Exchange Also</p>
<h3>Grains: Flour Competitively Sold, Wholesale Prices on this Street Also $0.05 Lower</h3>
<p>Nanyang Buyer Demand Still Uneven</p>
<p>Wheat Trading Not Easy to Approach</p>
<p>The spot market for flour continues to be sluggish. It was found that the factory intends to reduce the settlement price by $0.05 in order to compete for sales, because the buyer's price has been reduced. Therefore, starting yesterday, the wholesale price on this street was changed to $4.60. As for the price for buyers, it is a special confidential sacrifice in order to promote sales in North China, and it is not the official market price. Even those in the industry cannot know the details. According to factory news yesterday, the flour price has been in a chaotic state these days. It is heard that yesterday's retail sales in this street were nearly 10,000 bags, and the selling price of No. 2 flour was $4.60, while Nanyang still has a price of $4.65. The market price varies, which is evident. Under the dumping of foreign flour, it is really not enough to promote sales without competition. It is said that Jianyuan Company sold 5,000 bags of Citibank flour in transit, priced at $4.32. This batch of goods will be transported in early next week. There are currently few transactions for distant foreign flour. 500 bags of flour were transported to Shantou today.</p>
<p>Wheat trading is also at a standstill, but in recent days, there have been sporadic small shipments, such as dozens to two or three hundred bags transported from Suku and Jiangbei. Those holding the goods are holding on to prices of seven dollars and three to four cents because the production price is high, while the factory's purchase price is about six dollars and eight cents, resulting in both sides not being able to approach each other easily, and the market is as silent as ever.</p>
<h3>Japonica Rice Market Slightly More Active, Foreign Clients All Low Balling</h3>
<p>The source of Durham rice, the total arrival at the river is the 7th, and the car transports 3,000 to 4,000 bags of the cargo, The morning market sentiment is still relaxed, and few stores on this street have gone in, and the market continues to be sluggish. The price of thick and thin japonica has decreased by one or two cents. In the late market, the hoarders are slightly active, gradually becoming active, and then presenting a stable image. The price of Du Yang Jian and Bu Jian also depreciated a few cents, and the price change was due to the entry of foreign glutinous rice into the market. People's hearts are fluctuating, and they all hold a little bit of entry, and the market also fell by about 2 cents. However, it is said that only 300 bags of foreign glutinous rice have arrived. It is probably caused by emotional agitation. Yin Yuan belongs to a small amount of goods, so it can be fixed.</p>
<p>As for the Kexian, the current stock continues to be sold, and the opening price in the morning has been lowered by 2 cents. Then, new stocks and scattered households on this street took the opportunity to buy in small amounts, and the market began to turn from fatigue to stability, but the market is ultimately more than a small corner. The top Xian of Nanjing opened at 13 yuan, the appetite is still relaxed, and the total number of Nanjing Wuxian transactions in the big market has also been reduced to 2,400 to 500 bags.</p>
<p>Sai Kung No. 1 foreign rice is still only traded in small quantities. However, the price of $17 and some cents has been affected by the gradual decline of local buyers. Yesterday's asking price for the goods was 17 yuan and 1 cent, and the purchasers only returned 17 yuan.</p>
<h3>Oil Cake: Raw Soybean Oil Shows Little Sign of Improvement</h3>
<p>Although the soybean oil market has been stable for several consecutive markets, the sentiment in this city has shown little sign of improvement, and the market wants to rise but has fallen instead, due to the fact that the estimated arrival of Dalian oil in this month is about 17,000 to 18,000 barrels. Therefore, the amount of active chips on the market is wide and loose, and the sales volume is also rare, which leads to a sluggish decline. Yesterday, it was estimated that 50 pieces of Dalian and Qi oil were sold, with a price of 20 yuan for the original board, and 100 barrels of Fengnian oil in April were sold for 31 yuan and 5 cents. Now, 200 barrels of Dalian oil are sold for 32 yuan and 5 cents to 31 yuan and 8 cents, and 200 barrels are sold for 31 yuan and 9 cents and a half in three or four days, and 300 barrels are sold for 31 yuan and 8 and 9 cents in March, and 600 barrels are sold for 31 yuan and 7 and a half and 9 cents in April. Three thousand tins of peanut oil have been transported from Tianjin, and although people's hearts are stable, the market price has not had a significant impact. Yesterday, it was estimated that 10 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were sold, at 29 yuan and 3 cents, down 2 cents from the previous market. The price of canned oil was 50 tins of Qingdao oil, at 38 yuan and 8 cents, and 400 tins of Tianjin oil, at 38 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 4,270 bags of soybeans were transported from Tianjin, and 200 bags of soybeans were transported to Shantou, and 190 bags were transported to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: National Cloth Sold Mostly to Guangdong Buyers, Tianjin Mostly Used Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>The sales of national cloth to buyer groups yesterday was most impressive to Guangdong. The sales in the stores on this street were excellent. The situation in eastern Zhejiang is still tense, and all parties are deeply guarded, and the buying appetite has decreased sharply. Yesterday, Wenzhou and Ningbo groups still shipped out more than 300 pieces of fine cloth, coarse cloth, fusible yarn, bleached cloth, and foreign yarn, and the Guangdong group purchased more than 200 boxes of Feimeiren, Meirenyu, Juelu, and Xinshenglu brand colored cloth and colored twill, and nearly 100 boxes of plain fusibles, bleached cloth, striped bleached cloth, and etc., and nearly 200 bags of white goods, coarse cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill, etc. The dyeing factory on this street imported more than 200 pieces of colored twill raw cloth, and each had a wholesale transaction in fusible cloth, striped bleached cloth, and raw cloth. The market plate for each cargo is still trending firm. There is a shortage of spot goods in the market for colored twill and yarn plain fusibles and raw cloth. The spring and summer goods are very popular in the stores on this street, and medium and high-end bleached cloth and striped plain fusibles are the most popular. The work of each bleaching and refining factory is tense, and the output is slow, and there is a shortage of spot goods, and the raw cloth is abundant.</p>
<p>Because Tianjin merchants continued to purchase five to six hundred pieces of fine cloth and fine twill, and the outflow of dyed twill on this street was also good, the white goods in Dong cloth were sold firmly, and the faucet fine twill was increased by one corner per piece due to the tight supply of spot goods, and sold for eleven yuan and nine corners. Dongmian Yangxing continued to collect 200 bags of blue double fish fine cloth and five-width fine twill, and the market situation became more stable.</p>
<p>Imports and Exports: Seventy-six pieces of piece goods were transported from Tianjin on the 23rd, and seven hundred and thirty-five pieces of piece goods were transported to Ningbo. On the 24th, three hundred and seventy-five pieces of piece goods were transported to Hong Kong, and three hundred and fifteen pieces were transported to Shantou.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Shanghai Silk Gradually Feels Thorny</h3>
<p>Yesterday's overseas silk market saw a mix of rises and falls. Yokohama spot prices fell by 20 yuan, and forward prices fell by 22 yuan. Lyon Japanese silk and Shanghai silk each rose by one franc, and New York Japanese silk 83 and 75 degrees each rose by one cent. However, the Exchange recently opened at the original price, and the distant prices fell by 3 cents, and the coarse striped silk fell by 5 cents.</p>
<p>The Shanghai silk market is still quiet. Foreign firms' purchase prices are more than 50 yuan away, and users have no intention to enter or exit, because the overseas silk market price has risen and fallen rapidly recently, and the local people's hearts are wavering. Moreover, Yokohama has also rumored the possibility of a devaluation of the Japanese yen, and there is no reliable way to solve the problem of this spring's purchase in this port, so the silk market is becoming more and more tranquil.</p>
<p>Today, 31 pieces of silk ends were transported to Italy, and 28 pieces of tea leaves were transported from Ningbo yesterday.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: Almonds—The Market Soars High</h3>
<p>Sweet almonds are also related to the control of a certain party, and the Shen City is tightening, and the arrival and inventory are thin, which is enough to help the price increase. The market price for Baiyu Bian has reached 200 yuan yesterday, and some are calling for more than 200 yuan. Longwang Bian is sold for 170 yuan to 160 yuan. The rising trend of bitter almonds has been slightly reduced, probably because the increase was too rapid.</p>
<p>Nine hundred bags of Shengren were transported from Weihaiwei the day before yesterday.</p>
<h3>Scarce Lily Bulb Slices</h3>
<p>Lily bulb slices have recently seen a rise in price due to urgent demand from Hong Kong and a shortage of available stock in this area. Previously sold for 21 to 22 yuan, some customers with dozens of units are now asking for as high as 28 yuan (cash), and still seem reluctant to sell completely. It's understood that the total base stock in the producing area is no more than 300 units, and it's currently difficult to transport them to Shanghai, so the price is expected to continue rising.</p>
<h3>Paper - Tin Foil Prices Reduced</h3>
<p>Since the Lunar New Year, sales of tin foil have been sluggish. With ample stock in Shanghai and repeated shipments arriving from the production areas, the market has struggled to maintain prices. However, with strong support from tin foil merchants, prices have not fallen sharply. Recently, manufacturers from Shaoxing have been discounting their products in Shanghai, making it difficult to maintain the original prices. Recently, with the Qingming Festival approaching, tin foil merchants, in order to boost sales both locally and in other regions, have uniformly reduced both retail and wholesale prices.</p>
<p>5,500 units of native paper arrived from Ningbo the day before yesterday.</p>
<h3>Coal - Abundant Supply of Soft Coal</h3>
<p>No shortage of fuel in this city</p>
<p>Over the past week, large quantities of soft coal, amounting to over 30,000 loads, have flooded the market, making sales difficult and causing prices to plummet for several days, eventually halting trade. However, as the situation in eastern Zhejiang became tense, the market suddenly perked up, with prices rising by one or two "jiao." Large basket green coal is now priced at four yuan and five "jiao" per load, and bamboo charcoal at three yuan and two "jiao." It is said that trading among industry peers is quite active. However, due to abundant stocks, there is no fear of a fuel shortage in this city.</p>
<h3>Imports and Exports - Yao Flowers Dominate Imports</h3>
<p>Yesterday's imports included 6,780 units of kiln goods shipped from Shantou, and 7,800 units of native paper from Ningbo.</p>
<p>Today, another shipment arrived from Ningbo, including over 10,600 units of Yao flowers, 200 units of cotton yarn, over 40 units of tobacco leaves, and 1,250 units of native paper, which is expected to be imported this morning via an Italian vessel.</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Stealing Across the Fuchun River About to be Completely Annihilated</h3>
<p>Japanese Objective to Threaten Nanchang</p>
<p>Encountered a Fierce Attack from Garrison Troops Immediately After Landing</p>
<p>Yao County Magistrate Cables Xiao and Shao for Peace</p>
<p>Following the tense situation in eastern Zhejiang, Japanese troops stealing across the Fuchun River are about to be annihilated. Although Japanese warships are causing disturbances along the coast, Chinese military authorities have dispatched large reinforcements to defend the area. Xiao, Shao, Yong, and Wen have cabled to assure local peace. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Stealing Across About to be Annihilated</p>
<p>A small contingent of Japanese troops stole across the Fuchun River and, after landing, were met with a fierce attack from the garrison troops. The landing Japanese troops are about to be completely annihilated. It is understood that the Japanese troops' attempt to steal across the Fuchun River aimed to occupy the Linpu station on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, and then advance along the railway line to Zhuji and Jinhua. The landing Japanese troops, numbering about a hundred, were immediately met with a fierce attack by a large contingent of garrison troops and local defense forces on the riverbank. General Commander Liu of the Tenth Army Group has dispatched large reinforcements to defend the area. The Japanese troops' attempt will definitely not succeed.</p>
<p>Xiao, Shao, and Other Places Cable Assurance of Peace</p>
<p>The Shaoxing Seven Counties Association in Shanghai received a cable yesterday morning at 12:00 pm from the Yao County Magistrate, sent at 12:40 pm on the 22nd, stating: "Cable received, Xiao and Shao are at peace. County Magistrate Lin Yang Koutou." At the same time, shipping merchants received cables from Wenzhou and Ningbo, all stating that Ningbo and Wenzhou in eastern Zhejiang are at peace as usual. A reporter from the New Voice Agency learned from the Shaoxing Association in Shanghai that although Japanese troops have repeatedly attempted to steal across the river and land at Wenjia Weir in Xiaoshan County in order to attack eastern Zhejiang, they have all been repelled by the garrison troops. All counties in eastern Zhejiang have long-distance telephone access. If the situation at Wenjia Weir were tense, the Yao County Magistrate would definitely not cable assurance of peace.</p>
<p>Zhenhai Fortress Safe and Sound</p>
<p>The Tanglu ship arrived in Shanghai from Yong the day before yesterday. According to a certain foreign passenger, one Japanese warship, one transport ship, and three destroyers are currently concentrated in the waters off Ligang outside Zhenhai. On Monday afternoon, they suddenly bombarded the Zhenhai fortress, with multiple shells landing near the fortress. The defending troops also returned fire. However, the Japanese warships fired indiscriminately, and the fortress is safe and sound. The Ningbo Defense Commander has ordered the evacuation of residents. When the ship passed Dinghai, it saw several Japanese warships patrolling the area.</p>
<p>Eastern Zhejiang Army Corps Numbering Approximately One Million</p>
<p>It was also mentioned that Jinhua in eastern Zhejiang is an important military base. The Japanese troops' direct actions against eastern Zhejiang indirectly threaten Nanchang. The Japanese troops have long intended to attack Nanchang, but have made no progress to date, and the price they have paid is incalculable. To attack Nanchang, they must first attack eastern Zhejiang. Currently, the Chinese army has a tight defense along the northeastern coast of Zhejiang, with the number of troops increased to 500,000, plus an additional organized commando unit, totaling approximately one million men. The defense is very solid, and there is no concern for security.</p>
<p>Ningbo Merchants Starting to Disperse Stockpiles</p>
<p>The Ningbo Defense Commander believes that coastal transportation to Ningbo is extremely important for commerce. If it were completely blockaded, the impact would be enormous. If necessary, a surface blockade can still be implemented immediately at any time. It is also learned that the Wenzhou and Ningbo chambers of commerce have issued orders, notifying all merchants that all goods stored in the above locations should be transported inland as a precautionary measure for war. Foreign shipping companies have decided to continue to operate their ships as usual.</p>
<p>Foreign Merchants Continue Eastern Zhejiang Shipping</p>
<p>Yesterday, inquiries were made with various foreign shipping companies. British, American, German, Portuguese, and other shipping companies have decided to continue to operate their ships as usual in eastern Zhejiang. Although the goods shipped from Shanghai to eastern Zhejiang have decreased sharply due to the current situation, there is a severe backlog of incoming goods. The Tanglu ship of the China-America Company arrived in Shanghai from Wen yesterday, and is scheduled to sail to Wen again tomorrow. The Tangsai ship of the China-America Company sailed from Shanghai to Ningbo yesterday. As for the Shantai ship of the Zhengde Company, it has been decided to change its departure time to 4:00 pm today. The Haifu and Hailong ships are scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Wen tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Various Circles in This City Voluntarily Organize the National Spiritual Mobilization Association</h3>
<p>Electing Seven Standing Committee Members to Preside Over Association Affairs</p>
<p>Divisional Organization About to Begin</p>
<p>Since Chairman Chiang announced the implementation of the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline and Implementation Measures on the anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death, the nation has been greatly excited, especially the leaders of various circles in this city, who are deeply moved. They have decided to contact each other in accordance with the organizational outline and organizational rules promulgated by the Municipal Party Headquarters, and voluntarily initiated the organization of the various circles of the National Spiritual Mobilization Association. After many days of preparation, it was officially established yesterday. Dozens of representatives from various circles attended, with the situation being extremely enthusiastic. They swore an oath on the spot and unanimously upheld the National Covenant, elected seven standing committee members to preside over association affairs, and resolved to issue a declaration. The association for divisional organization will also begin to proceed.</p>
<h3>Zhengzhou American Church Property Bombed Three Times by Japanese Aircraft</h3>
<p>Five Patients Killed in Hospital Bombing</p>
<p>Two Hundred Refugees Killed in Shelter</p>
<p>Blatantly Disregarding American Flags</p>
<p>The Continental News reports: Yesterday (21st), it was learned from the Southern Baptist Convention Shanghai Headquarters that the American hospital operated by the Convention in Zhengzhou was hit by bombs during three air raids at the end of the week. It is said that five patients were killed in the hospital, and the shelter run by the Convention was also bombed, killing approximately 200 refugees. During the air raid on Friday, the hospital was directly hit by a skilled Japanese</p>
<p>Pilot.</p>
<p>The property suffered significant damage during the third air raid on Saturday, but no more patients died. According to confirmed information, Shanghai only received the simplest report. However, according to the local church authorities, the hospital and other properties of the church are marked with multiple large, brightly colored American flags. The closest</p>
<p>Chinese Military Facility</p>
<p>To the hospital etc. at the time of the most recent visit by Shanghai personnel was approximately half a mile away. According to Zhengzhou telegrams, the 200 refugees died in continuous air raids on Friday. Given the densely populated state of the city, it is feared that many civilians outside the shelter have also perished. It is believed here that there are currently six Americans in the Zhengzhou hospital, including four women. It is noted that the Southern Baptist Convention's property in Shanghai has already suffered</p>
<p>Significant Losses</p>
<p>Due to Japanese air raids. In addition, the Convention's hospital in Guilin was also set on fire by incendiary bombs, and a hospital in Chaozhou, southern China, was also destroyed. Church properties in Shandong have also been attacked several times. Church buildings in Jinan were hit by bombs and suffered significant damage. Yesterday, it was learned that after receiving a detailed report of the Zhengzhou air raid, the church authorities will file a strong protest with the Japanese through the American authorities.</p>
<h3>Steady Supply of Rice to Shanghai, Rice Prices Continue to Fall</h3>
<p>Following the rice industry groups' efforts to stabilize prices and ensure a steady supply, rice prices in Shanghai have returned to normal in recent days. Moreover, due to clearing weather and convenient land and water transportation, rice stocks from the production areas are being continuously shipped to Shanghai. At the same time, spring has arrived, the weather is getting warmer, and some rice stocks cannot be stored for long. Owners are eager to sell, and rice shops are reducing their intake, so market prices continue to fall. The rice industry groups' price evaluation committee is actively investigating rice stocks and constantly monitoring market transactions. The Soybean and Rice Industry Market Management Committee is also strictly enforcing price limits and cracking down on private transactions to prevent manipulation.</p>
<h3>Commander of French Garrison Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to the North China Daily News, Colonel Granier, who succeeded Colonel Berthelot as commander of the French garrison in Shanghai, arrived in port yesterday (22nd) afternoon on a French mail steamer. Colonel Berthelot, French Consul General Baudézet, and many officers from the French naval and land garrisons, the French Concession Police Department, and the fire brigade were at the Bund in the French Concession to welcome him. Two detachments of French soldiers and French police were lined up along the wharf. As the new commander reviewed them, the police band played music. After the review, he was introduced to the officers present before they dispersed. Colonel Granier arrived here from Vietnam and will soon visit the commanders of the various garrisons, the Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and the Consular Body. Colonel Berthelot is scheduled to return to his country in mid-April to take office.</p>
<h3>Over a Hundred Silk Factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Forcibly Occupied by Puppet Organization</h3>
<p>Arbitrarily Appraising the Assets of Each Factory</p>
<p>Plotting to Compel Shareholding Relationships</p>
<p>The silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang have always been prosperous. After the war, more than a hundred large and small silk factories fell into enemy hands, with property losses amounting to tens of millions of yuan. Until recently, all the silk factories were forcibly occupied by the "Reformed" puppet organization, which seized them for its own benefit. However, it is still vigorously enticing the factories to join in cooperation, and promising to appraise the assets of each factory. The puppet "Finance" and "Industry" departments will separately issue a type of stock, marking the appraised amount, and notify the factories to come and collect it. Its purpose is to force the factories into a shareholding relationship, indirectly placing them under the control of the puppet organization. However, the factories are deeply aware of the greater cause and have seen through the puppet organization's conspiracy long ago. They have unanimously expressed their willingness to sacrifice to the end and refuse to submit and collude with the enemy.</p>
<h3>Puppet Police Invade Concession, Municipal Council Files Protest</h3>
<p>Protest Lodged with Senior Consul</p>
<p>Stating It is Enough to Incite Terrorist Acts</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Information Office announced that Chinese personnel belonging to the Japanese Military Police are stationed at the Waibaidu Bridge, Sichuan Road Bridge, and Zhaopulu Bridge. The Director-General of the Municipal Council has lodged a protest with the Senior Consul regarding this matter. Also, during a recent gathering in Hongkou Park, the "Shanghai Special Municipal Government" police performed their duties there. The Director-General has requested the consul country to take note of this fact, as Hongkou Park is the property of the Municipal Council. The Director-General is concerned that any Chinese people in uniform or carrying weapons, other than the personnel of the Municipal Council's Police Department, may take actions within the Public Concession that are sufficient to incite the terrorist acts that the Municipal Council is eager to prevent from occurring within the Concession. These actions are inconsistent with the rules and all previous conventions.</p>
<h3>Tea - Domestic Sales Not Prohibited</h3>
<p>The Tea Industry Association of this city previously suffered heavy losses due to the large quantities of tea being blocked in Yong and Ou. After sending a telegram to the Construction Department of the Zhejiang Provincial Government to release the tea, they have now received a reply stating that domestic tea sales are currently not prohibited by customs. This is to inform you to check and notify accordingly.</p>

<p>Celebrating Ma Shou's Broadcast to Raise Funds</p>
<p>The Preparatory Committee for Celebrating Mr. Ma Xiangbo's Centennial Birthday sent a letter to the Citizens' Arts and Entertainment Broadcasting Committee yesterday stating that the Committee has decided to choose a date before the birthday to broadcast from various radio stations to raise funds for the gift of birthday bowls and commemorative medals, and has formulated a method: a donation of four yuan will receive a pair of birthday bowls, a donation of two yuan will receive a commemorative medal, and so on for larger donations. The income will be allocated to the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association as a fund for refugee relief, to emulate the old gentleman's spirit of caring for the people as if they were his own wounds in times of difficulty. The gentlemen of your committee are enthusiastic about public welfare, and we hereby specially request you to host the broadcast.</p>
<p>Training Refugees in Production Skills</p>
<p>The Shanghai International Relief Committee held a craft group meeting yesterday, chaired by Mr. Li Guiyong. There was considerable discussion about the issue of refugee production. It was resolved to allocate funds to open a laundry factory and a wireless training class. The class will be headed by Mr. Zheng Wenhan, secretary-general of the craft group, and taught by Mr. Zhang Heliu. The teaching materials will focus on wireless transmission and reception, supplemented by wireless principles, knowledge of equipment for radio operators, and repair skills. To emphasize practical training, teachers will lead students to visit radio stations, wireless machinery, and repair companies at any time, in order to cultivate outstanding talents and meet the needs of society.</p>
<p>Notifying All Schools to Complete Procedures</p>
<p>The Fundraising Committee of the Education Group of the Shanghai Citizens' Relief Association issued a notice to all schools yesterday regarding the fundraising for refugee production education funds, stating: This notice concerns the fundraising campaign for refugee production education funds organized by our association, which ended on March 10th, as previously announced. As it has been some time since then, there are still a few schools that have not yet cleared their payments, which is greatly hindering our association's statistical work. Therefore, we are issuing this notice again, urging all schools that have not yet completed the procedures to make payments to the various Shanghai banks before the 27th of this month to clear the procedures. This is specially notified.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops' Attack on Luhui Intercepted, Zhagang Burned Again</h3>
<p>It Will Not Be Easy to Restore the Old Appearance of the Entire Town</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Went to Guard the Wharf Again Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Zhagang Town, located along the Pu River in Nanhui County, Pudong, was landed on and set on fire by Japanese troops the day before yesterday, burning for several hours and turning the entire town into ashes. The town has suffered</p>
<p>Unprecedented Disaster For the Second Time.</p>
<p>More than a thousand male and female refugees, old and young, have been left homeless and wandering in the surrounding countryside, in a state of utter misery. The town was previously destroyed by Japanese warships last year, and after some time, the victims gradually returned and built grass huts, of which there are now more than two hundred.</p>
<p>Restoring the Old Appearance</p>
<p>Moreover, the town is the only important entrance and exit along the Pu River in Nanhui, and has thus become abnormally developed. After this great fire, the entire town has been leveled, and it will not be easy to restore its former prosperity. Previously, the day before yesterday (22nd) at 10:00 am, seven Japanese motorboats sailed from Minhang, loaded with 60 to 70 Japanese soldiers, and were escorted by a small</p>
<p>Warship To Land</p>
<p>The Japanese troops forcibly landed and first seized more than 30 empty rice boats parked along the riverbank, preventing them from sailing away. They also arrested three ordinary civilians on the wharf, and then searched the town, but found no traces of guerrillas. They then attempted to advance eastward</p>
<p>Searching for Luhui</p>
<p>Town (Luhui was occupied by Japanese troops but was forced to retreat to Xinchang due to harassment by guerrillas. Luhui has therefore been recovered.) Unexpectedly, when the Japanese troops were three li away from Zhagang Town, they were intercepted and attacked by Fan Gencai's guerrilla unit, leading to a fierce battle that lasted for more than an hour. The Japanese troops suffered heavy casualties and retreated back to the town. By this time, the townspeople had</p>
<p>Fled Completely.</p>
<p>Even the elderly were few and far between. The Japanese troops then set fire to the town, and the entire town of grass huts was instantly engulfed in flames, with thick smoke rising high into the sky, a truly tragic scene. It could even be faintly seen from the high-rise buildings on the isolated island. Subsequently, as the guerrillas approached, the Japanese soldiers began to retreat and board the motorboats at 1:00 pm, escaping. The three arrested civilians were also taken away, and their fate is unknown.</p>
<p>The Town's Flames</p>
<p>Burned until dusk the day before yesterday before being extinguished. The guerrillas rushed into the town, but because all the buildings had been destroyed, there were no fortifications to defend, so they retreated back to the countryside. Yesterday (23rd) morning, more than ten Japanese soldiers took motorboats escorted by warships and landed on the Zhagang riverbank wharf to guard it.</p>
<p>Small Warships</p>
<p>Four were anchored in the river, and more than ten motorboats carrying Japanese soldiers were shuttling along the Pu River area around Zhagang, Dujiagang, Wangjiadu, and Xinlonghua, searching civilian boats. The situation is still quite serious. However, the more than 30 empty rice boats that had been seized were released yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Protests Traffic Regulations, Japanese Side Studying Diplomatic Procedures</h3>
<p>Stating Based on Municipal Council Regulations</p>
<p>Due to Unsatisfactory Traffic in the Northern District</p>
<p>According to the Continental News, the Japanese Naval Landing Forces announced additional traffic regulations in Hongkou and Yangshupu. Yesterday (21st), it was learned that the Municipal Council considered this to be an illegal act and had sent a protest letter to the Japanese authorities. A spokesman for the Japanese Embassy claimed last night when receiving reporters from various newspapers that the Japanese authorities were currently "studying" the Municipal Council's diplomatic procedures. He also claimed that the regulations were based on the traffic regulations of the Municipal Council's Police Department, with some additions, given that the traffic in the Northern District was definitely unsatisfactory, hence this measure was taken to implement effective traffic management. When asked if the Japanese authorities had requested the Municipal Council to implement these regulations, the spokesman replied that they had requested the Municipal Council to publicize the regulations. One reporter asked if the official in charge of the Municipal Council's Traffic Department was specially trained at the London Metropolitan Police Service, and if the drafter of the Japanese regulations was also specially trained, as some of the regulations seemed to have unclear implications. The spokesman replied that the drafter of the Japanese regulations had considerable experience in traffic management and had conducted special studies of the situation in the area of implementation before formulating these rules.</p>
<h3>Japanese Side Continues to Transport Copper and Iron in Nanshi</h3>
<p>A Total of Five Trucks Transported to Hongkou</p>
<p>Since the fall of Shanghai, the Japanese troops have transported the machinery from factories in the city that had not been moved out to Hongkou to set up their own factories. At the same time, due to the huge consumption of military supplies, domestic raw materials have become scarce, so they are scavenging damaged and discarded copper and iron to transport them to the country for use as raw materials for manufacturing military supplies. Yesterday morning from 9:00 am to 11:00 am, the Japanese troops hired five transport trucks, loaded two trucks of small machinery and three trucks of scrap copper and iron in Nanshi, and all drove to Hongkou to wait for shipment to Japan by sea.</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Advance on Xisu by Land and Water, Chinese Troops Under Deng Break Through</h3>
<p>Reported Guerrillas Recovered Luodian</p>
<p>Puppet Police Station in Nanshi Attacked</p>
<p>According to people from Wuxi, approximately two hundred Japanese troops stationed in the cities of Wuxi and Suzhou, fully armed and carrying four light machine guns and one steel cannon, set out in separate routes the day before yesterday (21st) towards the intersection of Xisu. One route advanced along the small road of Mudu River, and the other set out from Wangting Railway Station by land, attacking the stationed Chinese troops with a pincer movement by land and water. At that time, the Chinese troops were in a precarious situation and were almost completely surrounded. Subsequently, the Dadao Team of Deng Benyin's troops served as the vanguard, and the remaining soldiers, with a determination to die, vowed to fight the Japanese troops to the end to repay their debt. Therefore, they fought fiercely, and the two sides fought to the death. As a result, the Chinese troops managed to break through. The Dadao Team captured a considerable number of Japanese troops under heavy fire, and the Chinese troops also sacrificed forty to fifty soldiers.</p>
<p>Recovery of Luodian</p>
<p>The commander of the Baoshan guerrillas, the night before last (22nd), led his team from ××× to encircle the Japanese troops. As it was late at night, and the Japanese troops in the area were newly transferred from Hangzhou, they were unfamiliar with the terrain and panicked. It is said that they fled in disorder, and the Fan unit annihilated more than half of them, capturing more than ten alive,</p>
<p>And seized a lot of light and heavy ammunition. After winning the victory, Fan left a portion of warriors to guard Luodian and led the team back to their original location.</p>
<p>Night Raid on Zhuqiao</p>
<p>The commander of the South River and Three Counties guerrillas, Ding Xueshan, on the morning of the day before yesterday (21st), during the quiet and peaceful hours of the night, unexpectedly attacked the Japanese military base in Zhuqiao. He surrounded the Japanese troops from all sides, selected another team of warriors to break into the Japanese camp, engaging in hand-to-hand combat and fighting to the death for two hours. The Japanese troops were unable to withstand the attack and collapsed, and Ding led his team to pursue them, intercepting a Japanese transport vehicle in the middle, capturing three Japanese soldiers alive, and returning in triumph.</p>
<p>Puppet Police Attacked</p>
<p>Last night (22nd), the sound of gunfire was very dense, and could be clearly heard on the border of the French Concession. After investigation, it was learned that guerrillas attacked the Nanshi puppet police station, killing or wounding more than ten puppet police officers. It is said that Wang Zhizhang, the puppet police chief, was also injured. When the Japanese guard troops heard the alarm and rushed to the scene, the guerrillas had already fled. The Japanese soldiers then searched nearby residents, but found nothing.</p>
<h3>Detailed Interrogation</h3>
<p>It was necessary that by the summer of the twenty-sixth year of the Republic, it was ruled to overturn the original verdict and send the case back to the Third Branch of the High Court for a new trial. After one hearing, the matter was adjourned for another trial. It is now learned that the Third Branch of the High Court, due to the fact that the informants in the case, Zhao Guangfu and Zhang Tinggui, were assigned to serve on the battlefield after the "August 13th" battle while in the Beixinjing Prison and have since disappeared, the case cannot proceed and the trial has been suspended. It was reported to the Ministry of Judicial Administration and the Supreme Court for verification the day before yesterday. Yesterday, a reporter suddenly heard at a friend's banquet that of the two informants in the case, Zhao Guangfu and Zhang Tinggui, Zhang Tinggui is indeed missing, but Zhao Guangfu was recently arrested in the Public Concession for robbery and sentenced to seven years in prison by the First Special District Court. However, he has changed his name, but the French police have discovered this and will bring Zhao to justice in the near future to continue the interrogation. The above information was stated by a friend with certainty, but whether it is true or not will become clear in the near future. As for another instigator, Wang Xinggao from Funing, his case was also sent back by the Supreme Court to the Third Branch of the High Court for retrial. At that time, Wang paid 20,000 yuan for bail, but the Third Branch of the High Court repeatedly failed to locate him and confiscated the bail money. It is recently rumored that Wang has become a traitor and was killed by guerrillas in Jiangbei. However, according to the reporter's investigation, Wang Xinggao is currently indeed in the Tonghai Qi area of Beisha, forming four guerrilla teams under the command of Zhang Nengren and Ding Jutang.</p>
<p>Poisoning Policy</p>
<p>Invasion of Concessions</p>
<p>Many Cases Cracked in Recent Days</p>
<p>The French Concession Police Department has been actively dispatching detectives to clear out drug dens within the concession in recent days. It is now learned that three more drug dens have been cracked in the area yesterday and the day before: (1) No. 17, Lane 918, Xiafei Road, where 200 packs of morphine were seized, each pack worth five yuan, totaling 1,000 yuan, and one Korean and seven Chinese, including Zhu Liangtian and Huang Muquan, were arrested; (2) No. 7, Huanlong Lane, Huanlong Road, where one Korean female drug dealer was arrested and over 200 packs of five-yuan morphine were seized; (3) No. 23, Guanhua Lane, Lafayett Road, where two Korean women were arrested and over 300 packs of morphine were seized. The Chinese criminals will be handed over to the court for investigation, while the Korean male and female criminals will be sent to the Japanese Consulate for punishment.</p>
<p>Impersonating Narcotics Bureau Personnel</p>
<p>Intimidating People for Money</p>
<p>Arrested by Detectives on the Spot</p>
<p>Two Accomplices on the Run, Strict Investigation Underway</p>
<p>The Public Concession Police Authority has always strictly prohibited opium and drugs. In addition to investigations by officers from various police stations, a specialized Narcotics Bureau has been established to handle matters related to banning smoking and drugs. Recently, some individuals have been taking advantage of the opportunity to impersonate detectives and extort money from residents possessing smoking paraphernalia. Because the victims have also violated the law, they dare not report to the police. As a result, these people have become even bolder and extort money arbitrarily.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 7:30 PM, Wu Peinian, a Henan native (also known as Wu Peiran, a detective from the Central Private Detective Agency that has been sealed by the court), along with Wu Yongsheng and Cha Quansheng, suddenly went to the home of Ye Xiaosan at No. 8, Songyang Lane, Xiamen Road, claiming to be personnel from the Narcotics Bureau of the Police Department. They said that they had received a tip-off that Ye's family had opium. They then took out two forged informant letters with the attached note instructing detectives to investigate and report back, as well as a detective license (issued by the Central Detective Agency) as proof. Ye Xiaosan, unaware that Wu and others were impersonating police detectives, was greatly alarmed because his aunt had smoking paraphernalia. He immediately took out 25 yuan in legal tender and handed it over to Wu Yongsheng, asking to be spared arrest. At this moment, a detective from the Narcotics Bureau, Li Shugui, happened to pass by and inquired about the situation. Wu claimed to be the detective chief, Ye Yuxi, from the Narcotics Bureau. However, the detective Su knew Detective Ye and realized that Wu was an imposter. He grabbed Wu Peinian, while the others, Wu Yongsheng and Cha Quansheng, seeing that things were going badly, immediately seized the opportunity to escape. Detective Li reported the incident and, together with Detective Shen Tianbao from the Zhabei Police Station, rushed to the scene, arrested Wu Peinian, and confiscated the two forged informant letters and the detective license. However, the 25 yuan in stolen money had already been taken by Wu Yongsheng and could not be recovered.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, Wu was handed over to the First Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Judge Feng Shide opened the court for interrogation. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi stated the case and filed charges of impersonating public officials and extortion under Articles 158 and 346 of the Criminal Code. He stated that there must be many similar cases, but they have not been cracked because the victims are afraid to report to the police. The defendants must have committed the same crimes in more cases than just this one. The Police Department needs to investigate the defendant's crimes and apprehend the accomplices who are on the run. Therefore, he requested that the case be adjourned for further interrogation after the hearing and that the two letters and the detective license confiscated from the defendant be presented to the court for inspection. Ye Xiaosan then recounted the ordeal of being intimidated and extorted, stating that his aunt was old and had become ill and bedridden due to the fright she received yesterday and could not come to court to testify. Judge Feng questioned the defendant Wu Peinian and then ordered him to be remanded in custody for further interrogation at a later date.</p>
<p>Life Bookstore Branch in Wanxian Bombed</p>
<p>Generous Compensation for Deceased Employees</p>
<p>During the war of resistance, the Life Bookstore dispatched capable employees to operate branches in the front lines, rear areas, and guerrilla zones, reaching more than 40 locations. They were always the last to retreat from the front lines, always the first to set up charity sales in the rear areas, and worked hard to promote culture and strengthen resistance in the guerrilla zones by giving up copyright profits. Most of the bookstore's cadres were young people who were passionate about cultural and educational work, valued their duties, and strictly observed discipline. On February 4th, enemy planes bombed Wanxian, and the Life Bookstore branch in Wanxian was completely destroyed. Employee He Zhongwu died with the store. The cultural circles of Wanxian expressed deep sympathy and condolences, and over 100 students volunteered to participate in the excavation. The bookstore's general management area, considering that Mr. He died on duty, decided to provide 200 yuan for funeral expenses and extend condolences to his family, in accordance with the regulations. In addition, it was decided that his family would continue to receive Mr. He's original salary on a monthly basis for a period of 20 years, until January of the 46th year of the Republic. Colleagues also planned to hold a memorial service for Mr. He, provide financial assistance to his family, and provide permanent care for his children. This generous compensation and concern for the families of the deceased is sufficient to encourage the bookstore's more than 200 employees to work hard, be dedicated to their duties, and not fear danger. It can serve as a model for the business community.</p>
<p>Theft of Hats is Rampant</p>
<p>Large Numbers of Thieves Arrested</p>
<p>Prosecuted for Theft, Possession of Stolen Goods, and Drug Use</p>
<p>Police Detectives Wei Wenzhi and others from the French Concession recently cracked a gang specializing in robbing copper pots and felt hats on Pingjili Road. They arrested 16 robbers: Dong Shichang, Wang A'er, Yu Decai, Zhou Jisheng, Hua Nanqiang, Zhang Fengcheng, Lin Xiaogou, Liu Hanming, Yu Caigui, Bian Yousheng, Li Qinghe, Zhang Jinsheng, Zhang Gensheng, Wang Haisheng, Wu Xiaomao, and He Houcai. They confiscated paraphernalia for smoking heroin, two boxes of stolen British brand cigarettes (100 small packs), and ten cans of Canned Flower brand cigarettes. They also arrested two receivers of stolen goods, Chen Xiqiang and Gu Kunyuan, and recovered 22 stolen felt hats. They were sent to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday afternoon, Chief Judge Liao of the First Criminal Division heard the case. Yao Zhaodi, a lawyer for the French Concession Administrative Authority, filed charges of robbery, drug use, theft, and receiving stolen goods. Among the defendants, Wang Haisheng, Wu Xiaomao, He Houcai, and Li Jisheng confessed to robbing hats, two admitted to stealing cigarettes, and the rest admitted to using drugs. Chen and Gu admitted to receiving stolen goods. The court verified the confessions and adjourned the case for further investigation. The defendants remain in custody.</p>
<p>Casino Bloodshed</p>
<p>Gao Binggen Forced Collection of Gambling Debts</p>
<p>Wang Shouzhang Opened Fire</p>
<p>Wang Shouzhang, a former detective from the Baoshan County Public Security Bureau, has a long history of criminal activity and has been wanted by the concessions many times. Recently, he colluded with Japanese and puppet thugs to open a casino in Yongyuanbang, Huxi, profiting from the rake. Because of his violent behavior, he accumulated many enemies. The other night, he was provoked by Gao Binggen, a Suzhou native, who was forcing him to collect gambling debts in the casino. Enraged, Wang drew a pistol and fired six shots at Gao, hitting him in the waist and arm. Gao was seriously injured and fell to the ground. Seeing that he had caused trouble, Wang seized the opportunity to escape. The police have learned that the main culprit, Wang Shouzhang, has a history of outstanding cases, so they have strictly ordered his arrest for investigation and prosecution.</p>

<p>Patriot Lu Shunlin Died</p>
<p>Yesterday morning (the 22nd) at around 9 AM, patriots from the Shanghai Youth Anti-Japanese and Eliminate Traitors Iron Blood Army engaged in a shootout while arresting bandits, resulting in the death of patriot Lu Shunlin. The facts are as follows: Since the establishment of the Shanghai Youth Anti-Japanese and Eliminate Traitors Iron Blood Army, it has been effective in maintaining local order. The local people are grateful for the peace. Recently, the Intelligence Department learned that some lawless elements were using the name of guerrilla forces to call rice shops such as Yuanshengchang, Dingtai, and Hengyigong in Caojiadu, demanding to borrow 25,000 yuan, threatening to take forceful measures against the rice shops if they refused. After learning of this, the department dispatched personnel day and night to investigate. It was discovered that this was the work of a group of Jiangbei rogues hiding in a shed near the Xue residence. Yesterday morning at around 9 AM, led by Team Leader Gao Tao Yun, a large number of members went to search the area. Unexpectedly, they were discovered and the rogues opened fire first, resulting in the death of team member Lu Shunlin. The bandits all managed to escape. Patriot Lu Shunlin was taken away by the Red Cross ambulance. It is said that he died before reaching the hospital due to injuries to vital organs. Local merchants were saddened to hear that Patriot Lu died for the public good.</p>
<p>Tourist Fell to Death in Amusement Park</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3:30 PM, an unidentified man, approximately 40 years old, wearing a herringbone overcoat, a Western-style short jacket, a felt hat, and black leather shoes, fell from the roof of an amusement park in the French Concession and died. He broke both legs and his left arm. The park's inspector notified the cashier, who reported the incident to the French Concession Police Department. Detectives went to investigate and transported the body to the Tongren Fuyuan morgue for an autopsy. The family was notified. It will be reported to the Second Special District Court today for officials to examine the body. The deceased's face suggested that he had been ill for some time.</p>
<p>Jeweler's Inheritance Lawsuit Undergoing Mediation</p>
<p>Zhang Ou, the elderly mother of the late wealthy Shanghai jeweler Zhang Bingxin, hired lawyers Ge Zhiqin and Sun Deji to represent her in the Second Special District Criminal Court, accusing her son's concubines, Zhang Qin and Zhang Dai, and his adopted grandson, Hao Qiu, of colluding to steal a leather suitcase containing sealed inheritance property, jewelry, jade, and real estate, and of abandoning their elders. They also filed a civil lawsuit seeking the return of the suitcase. The defendants also hired lawyers to defend themselves, denying the theft and abandonment, claiming that the property was divided according to the shares. Judge Miao Qingbang held several hearings to investigate the evidence and adjourned the case. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, another hearing was held. Both sides arrived with their lawyers. The defendant presented photos of the family division agreement. When the court passed them to the plaintiff's lawyer, the defendant Zhang Qin accused her aunt Zhang Ou in court of making false accusations and damaging her reputation. The court stopped her and explained the importance of respect and seniority. At this point, the plaintiff's lawyer stated that a Mr. Gu was willing to mediate the case and requested an adjournment. The court stated that the civil lawsuit could be settled out of court, but the criminal part must still be tried according to law. The case involves family members. The court hopes that they can reconcile. They are all one family in the future. Why be so confrontational? It is better for both sides to make concessions and reconcile. The case was adjourned for further hearing on April 1.</p>
<p>Paint Factory Fire Kills Three</p>

<p>Step-Mother Sues for Living Expenses</p>
<p>Yu Zuoting Testifies in Court</p>
<p>Maintenance Should be Paid by the Administrator</p>
<p>The Debate Concluded, Judgment on the 27th</p>
<p>Li Xu, a Suzhou woman residing at No. 16, Lane 341, Maitershast Road, Huxi, previously hired lawyer Kong Zhaozhang to represent her in the Second Special District Civil Court, filing a lawsuit against Li Zuhuai, Li Zumei, and Li Zukai, the sons of her late husband Li Beiping, and Li Yao, the legal representative of Zumei and Zukai (residing at No. 102, Xiafei Lane, Xiafei Road), seeking payment of living expenses. The complaint stated that in the seventh year of the Republic, Li Beiping (a native of Yong) took the plaintiff as his concubine. Li Beiping died in the autumn of the twenty-third year of the Republic. In addition to houses and land, he left 611,600 yuan in cash, all managed by Yao alone. The plaintiff received 250 yuan per month for living expenses. In the twenty-sixth year of the Republic, when the estate was divided with the testimony of group leader Li Yongsheng and relative Yu Zuoting, the plaintiff was given 10,000 yuan in cash, and 2,200 yuan per year was allocated from the ancestral property for her living expenses. The ancestral property was managed in rotation by the three sons Zuhuai, Zumei, and Zukai. However, Zumei and Zukai were young and managed by their mother Yao. The eldest son Zuhuai agreed to provide the plaintiff's living expenses from the ancestral property, but Yao, the mother of Zumei and Zukai, deliberately made things difficult, and the living expenses for the twenty-seventh year have not been paid. She requested that the defendants be ordered to pay the living expenses. Judge Wu Xiaoke held a hearing, and the defendants appeared in court with their lawyers. The hearing was adjourned, and Yu Zuoting was summoned to testify at a later date. The details have been reported in the previous issue. Yesterday, another hearing was held. The parties were still represented by their lawyers. Witness Yu Zuoting testified that he had participated in the Li family's division of property and signed the contract. At that time, in addition to giving the plaintiff 10,000 yuan, he would provide her with 2,200 yuan per year for living expenses from the ancestral property until the plaintiff came of age. The ancestral property was managed by the three sons in rotation. The administrator was responsible for paying the living expenses. The defendant's reason was that most of the ancestral property was in the occupied area, and it was impossible to collect income, so it was impossible to pay. The court verified the testimony, ruled that the case was clear, ordered a debate, and announced the conclusion, setting the judgment for the 27th.</p>

<p>To the Editor</p>
<p>I am writing in response to the news item published in your newspaper on the 15th of this month regarding the accusation of Liu Yingcen by his two nephews. The facts are completely inconsistent and seriously affect my reputation. My two nephews are now aware of their mistake and have published apologies to me in the Shen Bao on the 19th and the Xinwen Bao on the 20th. The facts of the false accusation are now clear. The original story is that I have an older sister who married Shen Jinwen from Yangzhou. My brother-in-law passed away in the third year of the Republic, and my older sister passed away in the winter of the eleventh year of illness, leaving behind one daughter and three sons. The eldest daughter, Kui Di, married a rice merchant surnamed Zhou. After the death of her parents, she was responsible for taking care of all of their belongings. The eldest son, Jiezi, studied classics and worked in Jiangbei Pincha Town. Juezi was raised by me, and the third son, Yizi, lived with his aunt (my younger sister). Later, Kui Di and her husband became addicted to opium and used up their own rice shop and the family belongings in their care. Jiezi also lost his job due to misappropriating accounts. Juezi studied in a clothing store in Rugao and unfortunately passed away last year due to illness. Yizi's original profession was Chinese medicine, but he liked to wander and could not settle down. When he had no place to go, he would live with me. Recently, he was introduced to a job by his cousin Liu Yanxiang. After Jiezi lost his job, he repeatedly asked me for loans. Recently, he even wanted more and demanded assistance. I gave him 10 yuan in legal tender and asked him to sign a receipt so that he would not pester me again. Who knew that Jiezi would become angry and resentful and collude with his brother to falsely accuse me of seizing their mother's property. Now, after discussion in court and mediation by relatives and friends, and in order to appease the people and out of consideration for the feelings between siblings, I gave my two nephews travel expenses to return to their hometown, as requested by the mediators. My two nephews have also repented and published an apology to me in the newspaper. I respectfully request that the facts of the letter be published to clarify the truth, correct public opinion, and protect my reputation. I am deeply grateful. Sincerely, Liu Yingcen, March 23.</p>
<p>To the Editor, On the afternoon of the 18th of this month at 4 PM, a patient named Shen Yougen, suffering from inguinal lymphadenitis, came to our hospital and was admitted to the general ward. At 4 AM the next morning, he was arrested by the police for theft. Your newspaper published a report on the 21st with only the words "Darui Hospital," causing some of my friends to mistakenly believe that it was a hospital employee. Therefore, I am reporting the facts in the hopes that you will publish them in the letter column to avoid misunderstandings. Sincerely, the Administration Office of Darui Hospital, March 23.</p>

<p>National Medicine and Dietary Therapy Special Issue on Measles</p>
<p>Infantile "Measles" Conditions and Dietary Procedures by Chen Cunren</p>
<p>Since the beginning of spring, measles has been prevalent among children. Recently, Shanghai has suffered a shortage of housing, with dozens of elderly and young people living in each small house, resulting in rapid transmission of the disease. Lately, the weather has been abnormal, with cold and heat occurring irregularly, making it even easier for measles to spread. This publication has recently received many manuscripts on measles, so we have specially selected several articles and compiled them into a "Measles Special Issue." This article is a revised version of my old manuscript and is published together.</p>
<p>The Period Before Measles Breaks Out</p>
<p>If a child has a fever that does not subside for three to five days, with teary eyes, nausea, occasional coughing, fatigue, and listlessness, they are likely to develop measles. If light red spots with slightly white crystalline dots are seen on the inner cheek muscles, it is a sure sign of measles. Measles spots will appear within two to three days. At this time, the child should eat a vegetarian diet, the less food the better. A little rice and thin soup is sufficient, with only a small amount of vegetarian dishes such as Chinese cabbage, cabbage, and tofu. Sugary and cold foods should be avoided.</p>
<p>Formulas for Use Before Measles Breaks Out, Often Drunk in Place of Water, Easy Cases are Simple and Light, Difficult Cases, Although the Medication is Appropriate, Are Still the Most Annoying and Difficult Times, Such as Drinking Cold Products or Cooling Foods, Easy to Make the Symptoms Worse.</p>
<p>The Period When Measles Breaks Out</p>
<p>The best drink to have when measles spots appear is water boiled with water chestnuts. Drinking it as tea in the morning and evening helps with urination, purifies the blood, clears phlegm, and promotes the eruption of measles. This is the best remedy. At this time, the child may not want to eat. Vegetable dishes are not necessary. If the condition is good, the measles spots are strong, and the child looks well, a thin porridge is still suitable when the child wants to eat. Side dishes are limited to jellyfish skin and water chestnut slices. Although jellyfish is hard, it is immediately digested when it meets alkaline liquid in the stomach, and its function is to clear phlegm. Water chestnuts can clear phlegm and aid digestion.</p>
<p>After Measles Breaks Out Completely</p>
<p>Measles is considered "completely erupted" when it spreads to the nose and feet. Before measles is completely erupted, all that is eaten are medicines that promote eruption and relieve fever. The temperature in the room should be kept warm. The biggest concern is the possibility of the measles receding due to cold. However, once it is "completely erupted," everything is reversed. The use of medication gradually shifts to clearing, and cooling foods are no longer restricted. Moreover, cooling drinks should be consumed after the measles is completely erupted. The order is as follows:</p>
<p>On the first day after measles is completely erupted, continue to boil water chestnuts to make tea or use fresh water chestnut stalks (sold dried in pharmacies, called 通天草, about a few copper coins can buy it) to boil water. This is also good. On the second day, boil two taels of water chestnuts and reed root together for drinking. From the third day onward, boil ten water chestnuts, two taels of reed root, and two bundles of imperata root together for drinking.</p>
<p>Side Dishes: (1) Clear salt mixed with tofu, (2) Mixed tofu skin, (3) Mixed Pinghu rice cake, (4) Jellyfish skin, rotate among the four.</p>
<p>At this time, limit the child to porridge. Rice water porridge can be eaten. The porridge should be thin for the first three days and thicker after four days. Milk is also not suitable, and bread, biscuits, and sugary foods should be eaten in small quantities.</p>
<p>Three kinds of fruits can be eaten: oranges can stimulate the appetite, pears can cleanse the lungs, and red sugarcane can clear measles toxins and is very beneficial.</p>
<p>After measles, there are often measles toxins, so it is advisable to eat more imperata root tea and red sugarcane juice (red sugarcane is produced in Guangdong, with purple skin and white flesh, about four to five feet long) and Guangdong bamboo knot tea (sold in Guangdong grocery stores), for about ten to fifteen days.</p>
<p>Prevention of Post-Measles Tuberculosis</p>
<p>After measles, the lungs are often heated and burned, resulting in coughs that do not stop in the morning and evening. At this time, it is best to be careful. Light apricot kernel dew and loquat leaf dew can be eaten. In addition, a doctor should be consulted for medication. Seven out of ten children develop post-measles</p>
<h3>Shanghai Workers' Cost of Living Index</h3>
<p>Rent Increases the Most</p>
<p>Food and Miscellaneous Items Secondary</p>
<p>The China Branch of the International Labour Office has released the Shanghai workers' cost of living index for January of the 28th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1939], which is 159.32, an increase of 2.83 percent compared to December of the previous year, a decrease of 4.49 percent compared to January of the previous year, and still an increase of 45.48 percent compared to the pre-war July index of 109.51. This month, among the various categories, 25 items saw an increase compared to the previous month, 19 items saw a decrease, and 14 items remained the same. Except for clothing, all other categories showed an increase. The most significant increase was in rent, followed by food, and then miscellaneous items. Fuel remained similar to the previous month, with only a 0.07 percent increase. Clothing, on the other hand, decreased by 2.52 percent compared to the previous month. The fluctuations in each category are summarized below:</p>
<p>Most Food Items Increase</p>
<p>This month, rice prices rebounded, with japonica rice increasing by more than half a yuan compared to the previous month, and indica rice and glutinous rice increasing by about one yuan. It was the beginning of the Gregorian calendar year and the end of the Lunar calendar year, resulting in higher demand. Additionally, the weather turned colder, leading to a decrease in supply. Furthermore, heavy taxes and the Japanese control of rice production in guerrilla areas, with large shipments exported, caused rice prices to rise sharply. Flour stocks were insufficient, and raw materials were lacking, pushing market prices higher. Large quantities of pork and beef arrived in Shanghai, causing meat prices to fall slightly. With the Lunar New Year approaching, the demand for chicken was high, and prices continued to rise. Soybean oil was in short supply and selling well, causing prices to rebound. After price controls were implemented on salt, prices trended upwards. The index for this category is 122.60, an increase of 3.28 percent compared to the previous month.</p>
<p>Rent Continues to Rise</p>
<p>Although there are changes in rent, it is rare for increases or decreases to occur repeatedly within a year. Therefore, its fluctuations are not as frequent as those of commodity prices. Rent surveys are typically conducted once a year. However, since the start of the war in August of the 26th year [1937], Shanghai rents have risen rapidly and significantly, so the survey was changed to twice a year. The first survey this year, conducted in January, showed that bungalows increased by another 5.86 percent compared to the second half of the 27th year [1938], Western-style houses increased by 5.19 percent, and shikumen houses increased by 0.41 percent. The index for this month is 315.08, an increase of 4.48 percent compared to the previous month.</p>
<p>Water, Electricity, and Housing Taxes All Increase</p>
<p>At the beginning of the war, Shanghai residents left the city in droves, numbering in the tens of thousands daily, mainly the wealthy and lower-middle classes. The working class had numerous connections and few belongings. If they had travel funds, they left quickly without hesitation. When the Shanghai war ended, they returned one after another, initially staying with relatives and friends and then searching for housing. However, the number of houses in the concessions was limited, and rents had already soared. According to this month's survey, there were frequent changes in workers' residences, with moving families accounting for 20 percent of the surveyed figures. With people from the mainland constantly arriving in Shanghai, there were few houses and many people, leading to an imbalance in supply and demand. Rent was bound to increase. Where could cheap housing be found? A three-story building in an ordinary neighborhood could house more than ten families, with around fifty people. The key money often amounted to one or two thousand yuan. However, tenants only sought housing, regardless of rent or key money. It was inevitable that landlords would take the opportunity to raise prices. As for workers, most rented from second or third landlords, adding to their burden. If the main landlord increased the rent, the second and third landlords would not only not object but would welcome it, as they had an excuse to increase the rent substantially. Moreover, increases in water, electricity, and housing taxes were also used as reasons to raise rent. However, the increase in rent far exceeded the increase in water, electricity, and housing taxes.</p>
<p>Clothing and Fuel Remain Stable</p>
<p>Coarse cloth, fine cloth, and bleached cloth remained firm in the market. Striped cloth, patterned cloth, woolen cloth, flannel, and socks saw a decrease in price. In this category, decreases outnumbered increases, and the index fell by 2.52 percent. Among fuel items, firewood was the most consumed. This month, the supply was scarce, and retail prices rose slightly. The supply of Wenzhou charcoal remained scarce, and prices trended upwards. Coal briquette prices fell slightly. The index hovered around 235. The prices of miscellaneous items were similar to the previous month, with little change. Yellow wine prices increased significantly. The index for this month is 170.16, an increase of 1.53 percent compared to the previous month.</p>

<h3>Children's Day: Children's Groups to Tour Gardens for Free</h3>
<p>At the Same Time, Major Hospitals and Sanatoriums</p>
<p>Will Provide Free Examinations and Treatment for Children</p>
<p>This year, April 4th is the 8th Children's Day in our country. According to news from the Children's Day Preparatory Committee, the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Shanghai International Settlement has informed the Shanghai Office of the China Philanthropic Association that all gardens within the Public Settlement (such as Zhaofeng Garden, Dahua Garden, Jiaozhou Road Garden, and others, including Huishan Garden, Hongkou Garden, and the Bund Garden) will be open on Children's Day. Children's groups from the city can visit in groups. However, for every twenty children visiting, there must be at least one adult to accompany them to take care of everything. As for when to visit, how many people will visit, and which garden to visit, each children's group must immediately report to the Shanghai Office of the China Child Welfare Association, which will report to the Municipal Council to handle the issuing of permits. It is reported that the office has decided to report to the Municipal Council on March 28th. It is hoped that all children's tour groups will complete the reporting procedures before the 28th, otherwise they will lose the right to visit. According to news from the Children's Day Preparatory Committee, major hospitals and sanatoriums in the city, such as Baolong Hospital, Renhe Hospital, Tongde Hospital, Tongren Hospital, Dahua Hospital, Sanmin Hospital, China Hospital, Shanghai Hospital, Shanghai Chinese Medicine Hospital, Shanghai Women and Children's Hospital, Huilv Sanatorium, Sino-Western Sanatorium, Minzhong Sanatorium, Pingmin Sanatorium, Xiehe Sanatorium, China Model Ophthalmology Hospital, Datong Dental Hospital, Children's Dental Hospital, China Dental Protection Institute, Shanghai Dental Clinic, China Red Cross Third Hospital, China Medical Association Health Experimental Zone, etc., have decided to provide free medical treatment for children on this Children's Day. Some hospitals have expressed their willingness to provide medicines (including injections, internal medicine, external medicine), free X-rays, free vaccinations, various preventive injections, free physical examinations for children, tooth cleaning, and children's health lectures. Other well-known hospitals and sanatoriums are still sending notices. All detailed lists and procedures will be officially published in the newspapers on April 3rd. Please pay attention to children and parents in the city. Various charitable organizations will also visit orphaned children in various shelters on Children's Day. Child relief organizations such as the Orphan Education Institute will hold commemorative meetings separately.</p>

<h3>Postal Service Suspends Sending Scattered Packages to Eastern Zhejiang Yesterday</h3>
<p>Small Parcels</p>
<p>Still Operating as Usual</p>
<p>Because of traffic obstruction and transportation difficulties between Shanghai and Zhejiang, and parcels piled up like mountains going to various counties in eastern Zhejiang, the Shanghai Postal Administration stopped receiving large parcels the day before yesterday (the 22nd). Except for Wenzhou and Ningbo, the rest of the individual parcels have also been stopped. In addition, two announcements were made, (1) Due to transportation difficulties, all parcels sent to or transferred through Yin County and Yongjia should be temporarily suspended from acceptance, but individual parcels sent to the main ports of Yin County and Yongjia can still be accepted as usual. (2) From now on, large parcels sent to Yin County and Yongjia, and their transshipments, will be suspended from acceptance.</p>
<h3>Parcels Sent to Zhili and Shandong Must Have Permits Attached</h3>

<h3>Electricity Users Terminating Service: Additional Tax Rates Determined Separately</h3>
<p>Those Terminating in April of This Year</p>
<p>Calculated at 32.5 Percent</p>
<p>The Shanghai Power Company has already increased the price of electricity used by factories and the cost of electricity for household lighting in the concessions. However, some ordinary users have applied to terminate their electricity use due to the high cost of electricity. Whether the temporary surcharge to be added should be added as well has been agreed upon by Hua Gengde, Secretary and Treasurer of the company, and the Director of Finance of the Shanghai Municipal Council. For ordinary users terminating their electricity use within April 1939, the temporary surcharge to be added to their bill will be 32.5 percent. A notice has now been issued.</p>
<h3>Sale of the Broadway Mansions: Terms Agreed</h3>
<p>Japanese Merchants Have Not Paid Yet</p>
<p>The Mainland News reports that yesterday (the 21st) it was learned that regarding the sale of the Broadway Mansions on the Suzhou Creek, although the original British owner and a Japanese business group had agreed on the terms some time ago, the sale is still on hold because the Japanese buyers have not paid the purchase price. Regarding the news published in the Japanese Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun, which stated that "the long-rumored sale" will be implemented next Saturday and Sunday, the reporter inquired about this matter yesterday and learned the above news. According to the Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun, British Commercial Broadcasting Company has sold the building to the Japanese Shanghai Real Estate Company for 5.1 million yuan. The building was built in 1932 and completed three years later. If it were to be built at the current price, it would cost more than twice the price demanded by the British company.</p>
<h3>Sharp Decrease in Labor-Management Disputes in Shanghai During the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>Labor and Management Uphold the Spirit of Cooperation and Mutual Understanding</p>
<p>Labor Administration Institutions Have Tended to Stall</p>
<p>Shanghai is the industrial center of China. The government had established an arbitration committee and a mediation committee to handle labor-management disputes in accordance with the Law on the Handling of Labor-Management Disputes. After the National Army withdrew from Shanghai, Shanghai's labor administration institutions tended to stall, and the handling of labor-management dispute events was left to the Special District Local Court. At the same time, the Industrial Section of the Public Settlement Engineering Bureau also engaged in mediation. However, after the war, Shanghai's industrial districts were reduced to ashes. During the War of Resistance, both labor and management in the concessions accepted the government's advice and worked hard to increase production and reduce unnecessary disputes, upholding the spirit of labor-management cooperation. Therefore, labor-management disputes after the war were greatly reduced. For example, starting in September, there were no disputes in October and November, and two disputes in December. The number of disputes in 1938 was greatly reduced compared to before the war. However, due to the lack of formal mediation and arbitration organizations, even very small disputes easily escalated. Disputes after the war were mostly about reducing wages, strikes, reducing working hours, closures, and requests to restore wages or dismiss workers, etc., and workers rarely requested wage increases. At the beginning of these disputes, labor and management first negotiated directly, and when they could not reach an agreement and could not resolve the matter, they requested the intervention of the concession authorities. Only a few applied to the Special District Court.</p>
<h3>Citizens' Associations in Various Districts Request Dispersal of Bus and Tram Stops</h3>
<p>Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road Area</p>
<p>Concentrated Stations Hinder Traffic</p>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation, 15th, 18th, 27th, 31st, 32nd, 34th, 35th, 36th, 37th and other district branch associations, yesterday jointly sent a letter to the Municipal Federation saying: “We are writing to inform you that our members have repeatedly stated that the area around Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road is the center of the Public Settlement, and pedestrian traffic has always been extremely congested. Moreover, due to the sharp increase in residents within the boundary, the degree of congestion is even worse today. Not only does it hinder traffic, but it is also easy for unfortunate incidents to occur. In the past, petty thieves took the opportunity to commit crimes, which was commonplace. Future dangers are even more unpredictable. The reason is that tram stops are too concentrated, which is the main cause. At the intersection of Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road, there are tram stops for routes 1, 2, 7, etc. on the east and west sides, and tram stops for routes 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, etc. on the north and south sides. A few steps to the east is a bus stop. With so many vehicles and passengers getting on and off, it is extremely crowded. The ease with which accidents can occur is to be expected. In order to maintain law and order and improve the appearance of the city, it is necessary to relocate the tram stops there. Our members suggest that the tram stop on the east side of that location should be moved slightly westward, and that the bus stop for buses traveling from west to east should be located to the east of Sanyang South Goods Store, and also slightly moved to the west, separately located west of Nanjing Road and Guangxi Road, dispersing the passengers getting on and off the trams and buses, so that the traffic at the busy intersection will not be blocked, and law and order will be easier to maintain. We are sending this letter to your association and ask you to forward it to the Municipal Council and the tram company and the bus company for negotiation in order to implement it." After checking the above-mentioned points, the association deems that this is indeed the most effective way to disperse pedestrians. The parking places for public vehicles should not be close to overly busy crossroads. Currently, most bus stops are leaving the traffic intersections and being set up separately, and the westward relocation of the tram stop at the west end of Yu Qiaqing Road is clear evidence of this. Because it concerns the safety of citizens, we are hereby sending this letter and asking you to quickly forward it to the Municipal Council and the tram company and the bus company for separate consultation and implementation. It would be beneficial to the public.</p>
<h3>Documents That Have Been Omitted to Be Stamped Should Still Be Punished According to Regulations</h3>
<p>Chambers of Commerce in Various Places Request Exemption from Penalties</p>
<p>Because It Concerns Tax Revenue, It Is Difficult to Comply</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance has stated that it has recently received requests from chambers of commerce in various places because various industries have requested exemptions from penalties for documents that have been omitted to be stamped, given the newly revised stamp tax penalties. The ministry believes that because this concerns tax revenue and affects laws and regulations, it is difficult to exempt penalties and has ordered compliance.</p>
<h3>Federation of Women's Organizations Holds Anti-Spitting Campaign</h3>
<p>Publicity Week Begins on the 26th of This Month</p>
<p>Obtained Support and Cooperation from the Authorities of Both Settlements</p>
<p>The Shanghai Federation of Women's Organizations believes that spitting everywhere easily transmits diseases and affects public health. This bad habit should be effectively corrected. It has initiated an "Anti-Spitting Campaign," led by Mrs. Ba Yuehan, Chairman of the Public Welfare Committee of the association, and preparations have been very active in recent days. In order to expand publicity, it has been decided to hold "Anti-Spitting Campaign Publicity Week" from the 26th of this month to April 1st. At that time, members of the association will carry various publicity materials and go to schools and public places to give health lectures. This matter has received the support and cooperation of the authorities of both settlements and the Chinese Education Department. The association has also specially made a "Health is Happiness" badge for people and children participating in the campaign to wear. The association's slogans are listed below: "Spitting everywhere will transmit diseases," "Exercise more, bathe often, be healthy, and have less phlegm," "Spit phlegm where it should be, either in a spittoon or in a handkerchief," etc.</p>
<h3>British Flagship HMS Bee Retires</h3>
<p>Purchased by the Original Designer</p>
<p>Who Is Still Dismantling It</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reports that the British Yangtze River Fleet's former flagship HMS Bee has retired after 24 years of service and has been put up for sale. Yesterday morning (the 21st), it made its last voyage, towed by a tugboat from Yangshupu Shipyard to Ha Wan (transliteration) Shipyard in Pudong to be dismantled. Mr. Ha Wan, who purchased the ship, participated in the design when the British Yarrow Company built the ship in 1914. It is also an interesting event that he is now dismantling it.</p>
<h3>Seventh Lottery Ticket Relief Fund Meeting to Be Held Today</h3>
<p>Totaling 51,900 Yuan</p>
<p>The French Concession Charity Lottery for Refugee Relief sold a total of 34,600 tickets in the seventh period, totaling 173,000 yuan. It is planned to use 30% of this as relief funds for Chinese and foreign charitable organizations, totaling 51,900 yuan. The Lottery Relief Fund Distribution Committee has recently scheduled a committee meeting to be held at 3:00 pm today at the Guangdong Road office to allocate the funds. It is reported that 90% will be allocated to Chinese charitable organizations for relief funds, and 10% will be allocated to Western charitable organizations for relief funds. The eighth period is scheduled to be drawn at Yiyuan on April 5th. Sales in this city and other cities are quite smooth, which shows the deep concern of all sectors for the refugee problem.</p>
<h3>Passports via Vietnam Can Also Be Signed in Shanghai</h3>
<p>China Travel Service Handling</p>
<p>Those traveling from Shanghai to the southwest inland via Haiphong, Vietnam, must apply for a passport in Xi'an. The Consular Visa Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong, in view of the increasing number of Chinese citizens traveling to Kunming via Vietnam, agreed to issue passports, but applicants must have a reputable guarantor in Hong Kong, and must have three 4-inch photos and 9 Hong Kong dollars. After three days, they can obtain a passport, which must be approved by the French Consul in Hong Kong before they can purchase a ticket and depart. However, those traveling from this city often feel difficult about the formalities of obtaining a visa because they are unfamiliar with the people and places in Hong Kong. It is now known that the China Travel Service in this city can handle the application for customers and apply directly to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Chongqing. In addition to the 4-inch photos, the passport fee is 8 yuan, but it takes time to travel back and forth, so it can only be obtained after three weeks. After the traveler obtains the passport, it must still be approved by the French Consul in Shanghai before they can purchase a ticket and depart. Currently, the only transportation lines from this city to various places in the southwest are Zhejiang East and Haiphong, so more and more people are detouring through Haiphong. After the implementation of these handling procedures, everyone says that it is much more convenient.</p>

<h3>Zhao Guangfu, the Murderer of Tang Jiapeng, Imprisoned for Theft</h3>
<p>Sentenced to Seven Years in the First Special Court</p>
<p>The Second Special Court Will Still Transfer Him for Trial</p>
<p>Wang Xinggao Is a Guerrilla in Northern Jiangsu</p>
<p>Yesterday's newspapers reported that Gu Zhuxuan, the owner of the Tianchan Stage in Yancheng, who was accused of being an instigator because he was accused of murder of Tang Jiapeng, Zhao Guangfu and Zhang Tinggui, was arrested by the French police on September 10, 1935. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison in the first instance by the Second Special District Court. Gu refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the Higher Third Branch Court.</p>
<h3>Results of the Trial</h3>
<p>He was declared not guilty on June 26, 1937, and was released on bail with a guarantee of 15,000 yuan. However, the French police also expressed dissatisfaction with the second instance verdict and filed a complaint with the Procuratorate of the Higher Third Branch Court to apply for an appeal to the Supreme Court on its behalf. The Supreme Court then reviewed the entire case file and considered that there was further</p>
