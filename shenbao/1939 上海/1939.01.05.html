<p>（東京）新閣員人選之最近預測、為外相有田、內相木戶、藏相石渡、陸相板垣、海相米內、法相鹽野、文相荒木、拓相八田、遞信鐵道農工厚生各省大臣職將分配興各重要政客、民政黨魁町田與政友黨魁前田等皆將入閣、（五日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）今晚九時四十二分、樞密院長平沼奉召入宮、受命組閣、查平沼騏一郎男爵、年七十三、供職樞密院已歷十載、曾任西園寺內閣之司法决官、一九三三年任司一法大臣、近年每决閣潮發生時，平沼輒有繼任首相之呼聲、日皇接近衛辭呈後、卽召見內大臣揚淺倉平、徵求其對於首相繼任人物之意見、湯淺請往見元老西國寺、而後奏復、遂於午後乘火車赴沿津、晚九時可回京覆命、據朝日新聞預測、平沼如奉命組閣、則近衛將任樞密院長兼不管部閣員職、原有閣員留職者、為陸相板垣、海相米內、外相有田、厚生相木戶、退職者為藏相池田、內相末决、農相有馬、遞信相永井、鐵道相中島、惟文相荒木、拓相八田、去留未定、平沼組閣將請民政與政友兩黨加入、大的前任「滿洲國」政府樞密參議員田邊將任閣員或內閣秘書長、新年假期後，證券市塲今晨復開、因近衛辭職、價格暴落、今晨近衛入宮時、內閣秘書長風見章卽正式宣布內閣辭職消息、近衛則於辭職後發表一文、略謂、一九三七年六月、渠甫就相職、中國事件卽吿發作、此後日臻嚴重、致國內外發生復雜局勢、今中國事件已入一新階段、而為日政府必須專致其力以造成新秩序、俾維持束亞垂人和平之時期、渠認在新內閣下製定新方針、以增進國人信任、乃屬必要、至於日政府對於中國事件之不可動搖的根本政策、則業已製定、而為日皇所核准、渠深懼才力不能勝任，現已呈遞內閣辭職書云、（四日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）此間陸海軍方面為應付在華之危機、必須建立集權政府、而近衛內閣卽在此稱海陸軍壓力之下、已决定於今日全體辭職矣、消息靈通方面對於此事、認為並非意外、日本國內同情法西斯派老如內相末决等、均準備解散國會、而將國內各政黨混合為一、使成為一單純之集權統治、據此間觀察家稱、近衛內閣此决辭職、適値日本麗史上最危急之秋、因日本在華與第三國之關係日趨惡化、允以與英美兩國為最、預料對外關係、難見好轉、除外交關係外、尙有多數嚴重問題、須待新政府解决、（四日美聯電）</p>
<h3>中國抗議戰意志堅決　不受日政潮影響　近衛汪精衛秘密談判失敗　日本下放局將益受軍閥操縱</h3>
<p>（重慶）華方發言人今日在招待新聞記者時聲稱、日內閣之辭職、無異公然承認過去十八個月中在華戰爭之失敗、而更在躁份子之佔優勢、亦可由此見之、蓋彼等以為、必須將日本全國置諸完全戰爭基礎之上、以便繼續作戰也、其對華之根本政策、殆無變更、不寗唯是、且將加强其軍事行動、在外交方面、大的日本將更作鞏固反共集團之企圖、而對於第三國權利、則將更無顧忌、就中國而言、日本內閣之變更、無甚影響、因中國已完全準備繼績抗戰也、日本旣為新激烈份子所把持、則日本崩潰之期、因之而愈近云、（四日路透電）</p>
<p>（重慶）據此間華人方面意見、日首相近衛之辭職有下列原因、（一）近衛十二月二十二日所發表之言論、未能產生其預料之結果、故引咎辭職、（二）日本各政黨為各黨本身存在起見、奮鬥甚力、據一般人預料、右翼份子將支配日本新聞、以增强對華戰爭、而關閉和議門戶、據聞、近衛與在精衛秘密談判之結果、乃於十二月二十二日、發表媾和言論、滿擬中國因在精衛之慫恿、而發生響應、縱汪不能獲得政府之完全同意、然逆料中政府定可因此發生嚴重裂痕、而促成和解之途徑、不意汪精衛之嘗試、孤立無援、薄弱無力、而中政府旣採行迅速餒峻之處置、全國復一致擁護蔣委員長繼續抗戰、近衛與在之和平運動、遂完全失敗、反而引起嚴重之讉責、同時各政黨合併為一之提議、將使政友與民政兩黨完全消滅、雖此兩黨在過去數年中、曾對軍人放棄一切、惟當其生存受威脅時、亦不能作最後之奮鬥、今後日本新閣、定將具有十足的法西斯色彩、而以軍閥操其全權、（四日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）朝日新聞謂、近衛辭職之主因、乃組織統一政黨運動及實施全國總動員計劃之失敗所致、去年九月宇垣外相提出辭呈後、近衛卽已决定辭職、惟終為環境所迫、繼續任職、及至首相所深切注意之統一政黨運動及施行全國總動員法案失敗後、乃决定求去、惟日本對華政策、决不因內閣改組而變更、反之、其對華政策將較前允為積極云、（四日電）</p>
<p>（東京）日日新聞謂、平沼素來信仰國家主義、如在承平之際、當自由主義澎湃之時、若出而組閣、各界必為之震動、現日本係在戰時、經濟統制業已增强、故若干方面認為、新閣對於日本之經濟機構、不致有劇烈之更改（四日電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）日本近衛內閣總辭職事、頃由此間各觀察家加以評論云、中日兩國戰事、旣已因而愈難結束、日美兩國對立形勢、亦且因而加甚、一般人原皆相信、中日戰事正向妥協之途前進、近衛前於去年十二月二十二日所宣佈之對華政策、雖由法國方面嚴詞加以批評、認為無可接受、但是月二十九日、汪精衛向中國軍事委員長蔣介石上將發出主和通電之後、此間又復認為中國領袖若干入、願與日本進行和議、同時幷認為日本因國內困難甚多之故、其對於中國政府亦當出以妥協態度、詎知適得其反、東京方面强硬份子、深恐中日兩國成立妥協、爰乃迫使近衛內閣傾覆、中國方面對於汪精衛主和通電、又復一致加以譴責、準此而論、日本閣潮自必無裨於遠東和平、反之、該國在遠東方面所抱野心、定必愈益擴大、至以美國而論、該國政府旣已明白宣佈、對於近衛樹立東亞新秩序之議、絕難加以接受、其對於日本之反對態度、自必日趨强硬、該國總統羅斯福卽當在短時期之內、向國會提出咨文、說明外交政策、其內容如何、允為法國各觀察家所注重」云、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（柏林）日本近衛內閣辭職消息傳至此間之後、德國政界人士大為驚異、良以近衛內閣不能持久、雖屬意料中事、初不料其瓦解如此之速也、此間各報因接獲消息、為時已晏、未及加以評論、惟有半官機關德意志通信社、曾就日本政局情形、發出詳細消息、此在一般人則謂、近衛辭職之後、繼其後任者、當係樞密院議長平沼其人、俾有以加緊集中全國力量、而將「日本偉大計劃、付諸實施、」此外、德國負責人士、均以極端保留態度出之、僅謂、近衛曾於辭職後發表談話、力言日本必須組成新內閣、推行新政策、俾克恢復國民信心云、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>美產被炸案　日方尙圖推諉　外務省答復美抗議　謂無標誌不負其責</h3>
<p>（東京）日外務省對於美國牒文所言美人在華產業被炸事、聲明不負責任、其理由為該被炸之美方產業並無正式之標誌、是以在空中不能判明美方產業、日方牒文復謂、有數處被擊毀之美人產業、係在合法的軍事目的物附近、故日政府不負日機師誤炸上述產業之責任、總之、日方之牒文、係拒負美國在華產業十三决被日機轟炸之責任、此牒文係答復美國於十二月廿九日所提出之抗議、此間觀察家相信、美日關係卽將達到嚴重階段、（四日美聯電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>日本內閣總辭職</h3>
<p>日本近衛內閣辭職的消息，在本年初間方略有所聞，却不料日昨一月四日近衛召開本年度第一决閣議的時候，便巳决定內閣總辭職，並隨即奏請日皇批准。在中國正値替「近衛和平」作應聲蟲的在精衛，被全國人民嚴厲申斥的時候，而其所秉承的「近衛和平」機構，却也於同時沒落，這眞是特別値得我們注意的。</p>
<p>近衛自前年六月組閣以後，便隨即對華發生戰爭：日本軍閥便用大規模的軍事進攻手段，想一舉而滅亡中國，而近衛却常放出巧妙的「和平」論調，用政治的陰謀手段，在國際上作一張一弛的恣勢，來掩護他們侵略的形迹。他自然是日本戰時內閣之有力支柱，但是現在這根支柱為甚麼自己要倒下去呢？照近衛自己所宣稱，內閣辭職理由，是因為「目前事變己入新事態，而達到應傾注全力建設新秩序的時期，而現內閣恐不能勝任」，所以非辭職不可。這話當然是一種冠冕的託詞，究竟內部眞相如何，我們也不難向各方面去推測。</p>
<p>第一，我們可以斷言近衛內閣的無法支持，是由於內部法西斯軍閥勢力的壓迫。日本軍閥對華十八個月戰爭的結果，弄得民窮財盡，而軍事上猶毫無辦法，自然只有更瘋在的要發展他們的威力。這裹便需要更多的軍事費用，和更大的軍事統制權力；然而前者對於日本金融財政的恐慌，勢將無法避免，而後者對於日本一切人民的生活和所有公私社團的活動，勢必受軍部更嚴厲的干涉；便是日本各政黨的本身，也非儘量受法西斯軍閥的支配不可，那麼近衛內閣本身又怎能應付這新的局勢呢？所以報載閣潮原因，與深具法西斯傾向的內相末决所主張的「政治全國動員」有關，足見日本軍閥因對華戰事焦躁的結果，己首先引起國內政治上的新變化了。</p>
<p>其决，在國際形勢方面，對於日本逐漸不利的情形，也日益顯著，這也足以使近衛向來與日本軍閥所玩弄的「雙簧政策」，以後會沒有人理會。最近英美對華的大宗貸欵，以及各國盛倡的對日經濟制裁，都不啻明示日本在國際上，已引起極深刻的反響；而日昨美國對於日本的新牒文，更絕不承認近衛所宣稱的所謂「新局勢」與「新秩序」。這種外交上的壓力，一天天的明白表現，自然也足令近衛內閣感覺得無法支持下去，打開外交上的新局面。便就中國方面來說，近衛的拿手好戲，是想勾結中國的動搖份子，拿「和平」來作幌子，作為包着糖衣的毒藥，企圖不戰而降服中國；可惜在精衛的呼應和平宣言，並沒有發生百齡機廣吿中所稱「意想不到的效力」，反而因他這種動搖份子的淸除，更加强了中國抗戰的力量。這不僅是在精衛的陰謀失敗，也就是近衛的政治陰謀失敗，近衛在國際外交上所表現的成績是這樣，不辭職，又怎能替日本法西斯展開新局面呢？</p>
<p>在日本海陸軍人方面的意見，像近衛這樣無力的內閣，旣然不能應付戰時的需耍，此後自然希望能夠成立更有力量的集權政府，以便日本軍閥為所欲為的硬幹下去；所以繼任的內閣如果不是軍閥的運用工具，便難免遭同樣的命運。然而儘管迎合軍人意旨，而毫不顧及日本財政經濟的命脈，則日本財政經濟上的悲慘命運，定必不旋踵而降臨。這只要看近來日本一般企業的停閉和失業勞工的增加，便已露示朕兆；無怪乎日本內閣辭職的消息方露布，日本證券交易所的各種市價都大跌落，其對於戰爭前途悲觀的感覺，在這裏顯示無餘了。日本政局的變化旣是這樣，很可以增加中國無限的抗戰勇氣，因為大家可以知道此後連近衛式的和平幻夢，也已隨着近衛的沒落而沒落；而日本法西斯氣焰的高漲，勢必加緊對華進攻，以求孤注一擲，中國只須堅靭抗戰下去，最後的勝利更加是日益接近了！</p>

<h3>法租界納稅華人會簡史</h3>
<p>— 黍甘</p>
<p>法租界納稅華人會成立於民國十六年春間，組織的動機，是為了反對法租界增加房捐，和要求增加華董與市民參政權。所定宗旨，卽為發達租界內的自治及謀公共利益與平等待過。</p>
<p>法租界公董局之有華董，實始於民國三年（一九一四）四月八日中法兩國關於法租界界外馬路恊定第四條之規定；當時首任華董者：一為向任同仁輔元堂堂董的吳馨；二為華商電氣公司總理陸伯鴻。就職後，設華董辦事處於愛多亞路三洋涇橋附近，每月由江蘇財政應撥付辦公費的三百兩。嗣後因蘇省財政支絀，前項經費停滯多時，辦公處也就停止。民國八年（一九一九）吳氏出缺，遺缺由保安堂董事陸文農繼任。陸氏於民國十五年（一九二六）出缺，未及遞補。到了民國十六年，界內納稅同胞，認為公董局華董祇有二席，而且槪由法總領事聘任，雖則華董已盡了相當的責任，然而席决過少，究欠公允；因此便展開要求增加華董的運動。當時適値國民革命軍抵滬，國際形勢大為變動；法租界當局顧及民氣，於是自動頒布公董局新章程，並增加華委員為三席，首任華委是朱炎之，吳宗濂，魏廷榮三人。但這不能動搖一般納稅同胞要求增加的信念，相反的，却啟發他們組織的意識，明瞭唯有有組織的行動，纔能發生偉大的力量，纔能達到要求的目的。於是便召集創立會，公舉黃金榮，張嘯林，朼月笙為法租界納稅華人會籌備主任，設籌備處於華格臬路八仙坊。恰巧那時（十六年七月），公共租界工部局擬將房捐百分之十四增至百分之十六，法公董局踵公共租界之後，也準備將一二房捐增至一四，（按二租界徵收房捐及其他興革事項，向取同一步驟，惟民國十年二租界當局均擬將房捐由一二增至一四，經法租界商業聯合會去函婉商，當由法總領事弗禮德氏審核公董局財政狀况後，卽行自動免加，此二租界房捐額不同之由來。）籌備會便以反對增加房捐的口號，來增强它號召的力量。理由是；該年度公董局預算，收支相抵，不敷甚微，無增加房捐的必要。經過幾决會議反對，法公董局方面自知加捐不徵市民團體的同意，似乎不大妥善；於是挽請杜月笙出任調解，以免案情擴大。經杜月笙幾度往返磋商，結果雙方商定暫加六個月，以補公董局該年度預算之不足；六個月後，仍照前額百分之十二微收。所以十六年秋冬兩季所有法公董局已經印就的一四房捐票，都臨時加蓋「暫收六個月」字，以為標誌。（按此案至翌年再度交涉，始减去一釐，卽今法公董局所收之百分之十三制。）</p>
<p>法租界納稅華人會在反對加捐一案結果後，便成立臨時理事會。由各團體代表選舉臨時理事二十七人組織之。至民國十八年一月，第一屆改選，計投票市民八百餘人，選舉市民代表二十一人，團體代表二十四人，舉行代表大會，選舉執行委員，龔靜岩，徐采丞，瞿振華，董克昌等十五人，候補袁履登，方椒伯等四人，監察委員黃金榮，杜月笙，金廷蓀三人，候補魯廷建，謝强公，並選舉張嘯林為主席委員。</p>
<p>民國十八年七月，華董吳宗廉，張嘯林，相繼辭職，卽由代表大會選舉杜月笙，張嘯林二委員為出席法公董局華董。至於要求增加華董一案，直至民國十九年十月二十三日，方纔獲得法總領事的答復；允設華董五席，及特別委員九人。該會經於同年十一月八日召集代表大會選舉張嘯林，杜月笙，朱炎之，魏廷榮，陸伯鴻等為一九三〇年華董，張驥先，金廷蓀，龔靜岩等九入為華委。此為華董完全改由民選之始</p>
<p>民國二十年七月第二屆改選，參加的選民，較第一决為多，執監委員大都連任，不過主席委員選由杜月笙繼任。</p>
<p>民國二十一年杜月笙辭去華董兼職，專理會務，其兼職由齊雲靑繼任。</p>
<p>民國二十二年十二月第三屆改選，參加的選民，較前更多。執監委員額亦見增加。執行委員為杜月笙，龔靜岩，金立人，瞿振華，毛雲，董克昌，王德言等十九人，候補為薛福基，顧文生等七人，監察委員為黃金榮，張嘯林，金廷蓀，諸文綺，戴春風等五人，候補為邵寶興，魯廷建，等三人，執行委員會第一决會議復選杜月笙為主席。</p>
<p>民國二十二年十二月，改選張嘯林，陸伯鴻，朱炎之，齊雲靑，吳凱聲為一九三四年華董，張嘯先、金廷蓀，龔靜岩，等九人為華委。</p>
<p>民國二十三年十二月改選，張嘯林，陸伯鴻，朱炎之，齊雲靑，張驥先，為一九三五年華董。</p>
<p>民國二十四年十二月第四屆改選，參加的選民，計有三千七百餘人，選出市民代表為杜月笙等二十一人；團體代表則由第二特區市民聯合會等選出瞿振華等二十四人，卽於十二月二十五日在中匯大樓舉行代表大會，選舉杜月笙，金廷蓀，董克昌，毛雲，瞿振華等十九人為執行委員，朱文德，張翔雲七人為候補，黃金榮，張嘯林，諸文綺等五人為監委，邵賓興等三人為補侯。並選舉杜月笙為主席，金廷蓀為副主席。至於一九三六年華董，則選由張嘯林，陸伯鴻，錢新之，齊雲靑，張驥先等擔任。華委則選由祖興讓，張法堯，董克昌等九人擔任。一九三七年華董因戰事未改選，今年（一九三八年）因華董陸伯鴻出缺，選由祖興讓繼任，祖氏華委缺則改由簣延芳氏繼任。至執堅委員，人事上雖有變動，因碍於法令，迄今遝未改選。</p>

<h3>米業市塲開市　米價平穩　行客交易增加　內地來貨亦旺</h3>
<p>本市米業市塲、於新年休業三天後、昨日假滿開市、米價平穩、各帮行客交易劇增、內地運滬米糧亦旺、日方與遊擊區各縣之偽組織龍斷糧食後、偷稅出口、每週的有四五萬包、各情如次、</p>

<p>交易增加　來源亦旺</p>
<p>在新年三天例假中、行客交易停頓、米號業方面、所進之貨、供給市民食糧、門市存底已屬减少、故昨日市塲、開市後、行客帮交易劇增、計成交數達一萬二三千包、（均係棧貨）至於內地來源亦頗旺、因海關休假期間停止辦公、自去年底到滬米糧、裝置輸上、於昨晨開關後、始行卸岸、</p>
<p>日商偷運　米糧甚鉅</p>
<p>日本因國內經濟枯竭、苛稅重疊、人民負担加重、是以日方急欲謀我資源、以資彌補在游擊區於日軍勢力所及各地、由日商與偽組織出面積極壟斷糧食、在鄉間極盡搜括、並壓低市價、農民痛苦萬分、經濟比較寬裕之農村、均存儲稻毅、不願碾白出售、藉以抵制、惟日方利用奸商、代為收購者、仍無處無之、探悉每週中由內地裝運來滬之米糧、在虹口偷運出口數的四五萬包、即華商私有之米糧、以軍事為託詞、先將查對、而事後則一錢不化携儎以去、</p>

<p>異常緊張</p>
<p>鎭海外海水警局聞訊、電令海門石浦、調撥水警三中隊、每隊四十八名、的共一百四十餘名、於本年一月二日、乘某輪抵定、因不能靠泊碼頭、折回竹山門、乃為游擊隊趕到該處、勒令二中隊繳械、餘一中隊、見勢不佳、立卽逃入原輸、由該輪開赴海門、將該水警一中隊卸上後、再開赴寗波、此事實之經過也、查定海</p>
<p>水警隊部</p>
<p>向置有無錢電報、便與外間互通消息、此時亦為游擊隊所控制、無法通電、致旅滬同鄉眞相不明、、大起驚恐、又數日前、靈禾鄉有土匪一百餘入、發生大刦案、居民損失甚鉅、因該鄉離城甚近、外間遂謠傳十匪佔據縣城、允屬小確、定海縣長陳穎心、</p>
<p>電小辭職</p>
<p>、業已照准、由陳保舉縣黨部特派員林世澤繼任、省方亦已照准、有某姓因謀縣長不得、心中不無憤懣、此决事變、有人疑其從中煽惑、傳說如是、確否未敢信也、現城內衜頭、秩序均已恢復、定海旅滬同鄉，昨均接有復電、人心為之大安、</p>

<p>英文大美晚報云、今日（四日）侵晨、華人四名循惇信路飛奔、不顧巡捕之喝令停止、遂成為巡邏巡捕之射擊目標、計向嫌疑犯放四槍、但顯無效用、經過如下、靜安寺捕房巡捕一小隊、沿惇信路而行、的在侵優三時許、聞道旁某處槍聲一響、數秒鐘後、見華人四名紛紛逃弁、巡捕乃喝令停步，並執槍備射、但該華人四名突避入橫弄中、行動迅速、巡捕急向之開放四槍、但四人巳在黑暗中失其所在、該區道路上大批巡捕與白俄商團、整夜巡邏、除匪徒以外、彼等另遇一種危險、蓋昨晚極司非爾路五角塲附近、巡捕一名被汽車撞倒、腦部受震動也、</p>
<p>盜匪襲擊　巡邏警車</p>

<p>滬市各銀行營業方針、自從戰事發生後、即力採穩健辦法、對於各種放款、頗為謹愼、且戰後滬市人口增加、貨物求過於供、工廠日夜開工趕製、造成畸形發展現象、市面頓吿活潑、故戰前戰後所放出之款、為能如期收回、本屆各銀行營業方針、亦决本過去鞏固本身地位、扶助工商各業發展、利用資金、協助政府開發西南、以增富源、</p>
<p>各業準備　辦總結束</p>
<p>滬市工商各業年終總結束期、素以錢業為依歸、而錢業總結束期、向例為農曆大除夕、本年大除夕、為二月十八日、錢業巳决定是日辦理總結賬、工商各業亦以距離大結束期已近、均擬未雨綢繆、積極推廣營業、各地游擊區以當地生產已瀕絕境、均紛向滬上採辦貨物、故各業營業、殊為繁興、本屆大結束、决能安然渡過也、</p>

<p>寓居周家牌路普愛坊八十四號之揚州人徐方富、在電燈公司為銅匠家道小康、與遠房族弟徐方慶同居一室、近渠賭博輸負、遂起不良之心向河間路申新六廠之同事江北人居毓湖·劉順良·王阿三·陳德良·袁九林等、商議搶刦其族兄徐方當家之財物　上月三十下午九時許、若輩</p>

<h3>金融　烚赤衝出二千元關　比封關前漲十一元　籌碼枯短價易上騰</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗槃市况、雖値新年例假、然各方人心因鑒英純金再度暴漲致乃重復向榮、港帮購金心亦益加濃厚、不惜貴價收買、且本市存金經港帮及天津帮等竭力搜購、故流通籌碼巳形枯竭、因之價格重復騰踊、據非正式價巳衝出二千元大關、聞某錢兌業收進新同行數十兩、價一千九百九十三元、（因成色稍遜、故而作低數元）、後又進客戶三十兩、價二千元、另一錢兌業代港帮搜購百餘兩、價二千元及零零二三元、均由同業及本地帮供給、</p>
<p>飾金掛二〇二元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金因在假期內、未見隨長、仍懸原價、大同行掛二白零二元、新同行二百元、（收進的一百九十四五元、）</p>
<p>純金再漲五便士</p>
<p>又三日倫教電、英純金因受英滙暴縮影響、故漲風益熾、每盎斯又昂五辦士、巳升達七鎊十先令半辦士、（較假前共計五辦士、）</p>
<h3>倫敦大條　空前暴漲　印銀繼續高昂</h3>
<p>三日倫敦電、有人補空、供給有限、然進者尙覺知足、市平收盤後、市面甚形恍惚、近期帶軟、照掛牌價低一八七五　做過交易、遠期平而帶軟、大條銀近期暴漲一辦土〇六二五、達二十一辦士一二五、遠期亦狂昇半辦土、為二十辦士一二五、紐的電、美銀價依然有行無市、叉孟買電、印銀市况挺俏、現貨又漲三安那、近遠期亦績昇二安那、</p>
<h3>紗花預測今日　紗價當有好面　棉花亦難看鬆</h3>
<p>昨據某紗商消息、浙東方面、仔活動之象、但紗商在此封關中、皆不願貿然脫售、須俟今日開市觀測大勢後、再作營業計書、因此未能妥協、照上情形今日市價當有好面也、並聞前日巳有棉紗七十件運天津、四十件運烟台、昨日尙有五件運廈門、二百四十件運汕頭、五件這海口、四件運北海、一百十件運海防、又棉花市面、在上年年尾、各廠均停頓、市情呆滯、但據多數同業意見、開關後市面亦難看鬆、蓋某方把持允甚、蘇北棉價頗低、緬絨均在五十元關內然外運一層、手績旣蔴煩、且困難異常、所有之苛相雜稅、名目甚多、種類不一、過境稅咧、通行證咧、特別派司稅咧、出口稅咧、換言之目的都係削錢便了、據云每担抵滬、增合十五六元之　、農民商人、處此環境之下莫不呌苦連天矣、故申地通花售價在六十四五元之問、咋有姚花巨量報進口、約計一萬幾千包、後批尙有數千包在途、與市面不生問題都係以前拋費貨到紛紛抵解廠額云、又由新港運來棉花一百八十件、出口亦有六十件運杳港、</p>
<h3>國外消耗激增　印棉創五月來之新高價</h3>
<p>外棉市價、紐的棉市開盤先因交易消淡、略跌三五磅、後據統計報吿、假期內布匹交易盛旺、人心一振、同時因金價堅定經紀商、同業及出口商均有大額交易、結果收盤時、較假前反張六七磅音、印棉近日來因國外對印棉之消耗激增、加之前會有謠傳印政府將於去年减少田畝之議、故各同業及出口商進胃甚為踴躍棉價因之連漲多日、已達五月以來之最高價、此實堪我國人所注意也、埃及棉價萎靡異常、昨日父跌六七磅音、昨日為銀行例假、滙兌無市，故現貨行市祇能缺如、</p>
<p>本市外棉交易、因大部紗廠、昨日仍為假期、故交易靜寂、唯各日商棉行、巳全部開始辦公、昨日英商綸昌印染廠會向福家及美安二洋行訂購下級長殲維之美棉一千包、付款辦法為現鈔即裝、因銀行封關、故所購者為金價、每磅的九分半、折合法幣加稅合送廠價的八十四元、</p>
<h3>糧食　常錫糙米　到九元半　滬市昨又見帶緊　米麥雜糧有出口</h3>
<p>昨日國米來源、袛到河下貨八九艘、軍輪包子一二千包、本街及囤戶去路已不若前朝之活絡、惟因聞常錫等地經日商壟斷後、糙價竟頃至九元四五角、合滬市須在十二元五六角、以致售方心思殊堅、板持甚力市面又見帶緊、厚薄粳價悉增幾分、惟羊尖去路獨廣、猶佾一角、杜羊尖亦頗穩健、陰元仍以缺貨挺秀、變元亦緊、今日有米一千三百包運厦門、</p>
<p>前日有麺粉二千九百包運大津、今日又有一千包運厦門、又三千五百包遝汕頭、</p>
<p>又昨有麥三百七十包自新巷來、</p>
<p>今日又有麩皮三千包、豆子一百二十包運厦門、又豆子一百五十包運汕頭、</p>
<h3>客秈整批交易　須待今明决定</h3>
<p>昨客秈到頭略有、消化已淡、緣前日本街暢辦本客各秈後、納胃均已轉懈、而囤戶客帮與日商交易統未發動、因此全日袛零戶成交三四百包、其整票交易雖有接洽、尙須决定於今明日、售開行情略比前市步砌數分、惟形勢旋即轉平、</p>
<h3>糖市　轉口粗白升五分</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢巳舍穩定、公會劃盤、現貨二四荷粗白本棧貨二十四元四角半，無上落、惟轉口貨升五分、以十六元二角半成交、太古車白浦西現貨仍二十四元、浦東貨呌升一角、國糖平定、潮靑續開千餘包、黃崗靑為十二元、次十一元八角至七六五角、上綿赤二百數十包、十四元八角至六七角、海南赤百餘包、貨較高價為十一元、建帮開出刁靑二百餘包、十一元一角、决之十元零九角、興赤百十餘包、十四元七角至十四元三角雜路决白數十包十八元一角</p>
<h3>南北貨　粵港兩帮　動辦湘蓮</h3>
<p>湘蓮因連日粵港兩帮均有動辦、市勢至緊、前呌一百二十元、茲巳成盤、本街交易亦甚活潑、故行方主守者較多、昨市復呌一百二十二元、較决者一百八十元、</p>
<p>今日有生仁一千九百五十包</p>
<p>海味　冬天魚翅銷路旺</p>
<p>魚翅依通常習慣、歲尾年頭、銷路自較平時為旺、最近各檔花色俱有售出、其價計呂宋王每担八百元至一千元、統白六百兀至七百元、頂沙七百元至九百元、大二三沙乏貨、四沙二百五十元至三百元、堆翅五百八十元棉裙四百元至五百五十元、上靑皮刀近亦斷檔烏勾一百七十元至二百八十元、烏皮一百元至二百元、烏羊四十元至一百元、</p>
<h3>進出口　滬甬間貨物　來去均頗客觀</h3>

<h3>金融之部　經濟資料　民廿七年份上海金融統計圖表　（本報每週商情總結之總結）</h3>
<p>進入二十七年時，上海不幸已遭淪陷。幸經民心之鎭定，興各界慘淡之維持，上海整個社會經濟，得免擾亂。金融方面，尤爲穩定。辦報復刋以來，每週皆有商情總結之刋載。茲為便利各方參考計，特補成一年來之總結，並繪曲綫圍，傳讀者一覩瞭然共趙勢之變遷。幸各界注意之。</p>
<p>票據</p>
<p>銀行滙票承兌所成立後，票據顯日見發達，戰事開始以來，票據流通之减少，决非票據信用之不　，主因乃在銀錢各界之收縮信用。</p>
<p>金利</p>
<p>幣制改革以來，滬上金融界已漸進於低金利時代，當局復恊助低金利政策之推進，以謀國民經濟建設運動之開始，惟自八一三戰事以來，銀錢旣在收縮信用，政府當局復力行通貨收縮，雖然，上海息市之迄未暴漲，足見金融市塲穩定之一斑。</p>
<p>內債</p>
<p>中日開戰後、交易所早已奉令停業、故去歲八一三以後之債券、已無合法市塲、下表所列、係暗市價、暗盤之出現、據云由投資者調達資金所引起、繼爲投機者利用，今則藉黑市以便維持債市、此係以毒攻毒之謂歟、觀夫進來各月債市之回昇、雖受抗戰前途光明之刺激、然有人從中維持、亦無可否認之事實、</p>
<p>（註）二十七年八月起皆係曙盤價、單位國幣元、　各債總平均指數、係以十足價為基準、</p>
<p>金市</p>
<p>上海金價變動，受英金之影響，固不待言，惟滬金漲勢遠較英金爲烈，無疑係受資金外逃之刺激，此種趨勢，於廿七年四月後更爲明顯，入秋英金暴漲，滬金之漲勢，乃益發不可收拾</p>
<p>（註）廿六年八月前係標金價，同年九月係標準金價，十月至廿七年四月係銀行收買現貨價，以後係現金暗盤收盤價，（標金每條重市平十兩，合漕平八兩半强）　倫教每盎司合便士數，係全月平均價。</p>
<p>匯外</p>
<p>八一三戰事發生後牛年間，我國外匯，始終屹然不動，惟自日方在華北手創「聯銀」發行偽券，我國為防止外滙被掉走計，乃實施統制，並漸進而管理對外貿易，喪心病在者竟乘機進出黑市，甘為人利用，是以即起滙市慘跌風潮，下表三月後即便黑市價，至中央銀行之掛牌及其對核准者之供給，則仍按法定滙率計算，從未或動。</p>
<p>（註）二十七年三月起，根據外滙黑市收盤價平均，單位，英滙國幣一元合便　，餘係國幣百元合美元，馬克，法郎，港元，日圓數，圖中之實綫，自木年三月後係暗盤，虛綫則係中央銀行掛牌價。</p>

<h3>自由和野蠻的分野</h3>
<p>— 白櫻</p>
<p>據一個日本的軍人誇口說，以中日兩國的兵士相比較，日本兵的知識水準要遠比中國兵為高·於是一位「銃後」文人馬上就來做文章，斷定中國是文化低的野蠻國，並引證了一位名人的話，說自古名將不出於野蠻人之間，而是出於文化人之間的。</p>
<p>接着為表示他「文人」的「公正」態度起見，又說我們不能以否定野性的強健性，而證明文明人的強處·因為古代歷史上有不少文明的國家，曾受過野蠻人的征服或威脅。如古代具有高度文明的波斯，常受野蠻人的侵略。中國中原文化地帶的常受夷狄侵擾，甚至被幾度征服，而且因此斷定無產階級的企圖「征服」資產階級，也不外出於文化水準較低的野性勝利的妄想。</p>
<p>但野蠻和文明交戰的最後勝利，必然仍歸於文明，就連這位「銃後」文人也承認了的。據說古代斯巴達和雅典的搏鬥，就是最好的例子。因斯巴達的武力雖強盛一時，結果斯巴達究竟滅亡了，而雅典的文明，則至今日尚垂存於世。</p>
<p>若說今日的日本是「文明」的雅典，而中國乃是「野蠻」的斯巴達，不曉得這位「文人」有沒有勇氣承認？他提起筆來時雖想打別人的耳光，可是卻每一次都打在自家的巴掌上！</p>
<p>侵略是野蠻的行為，連希脫勒和莫索里尼都這樣說。我們的「銃後」文人，即是柏林－羅馬軸心的支持者，自然也不敢有所創新。其實一條早為舉世公認的真理，那怕你怎樣的狡猾，也是不便否認的。但侵略者的野心，決不會僅僅因為有這樣的真理存在，便停止他的侵略的行動。於是便只好張冠李戴掉個槍花，硬說侵略者是被侵略者，而被侵略者倒是侵略者。這樣顛倒是非的戰略雖是乏極的戰略，但畢竟因為是「野蠻」的關係，再也想不出「文明」的戰略。</p>
<p>到今日還來爭論中日兩國誰是侵略者，簡直是白癡說鬼話。聚世界文明國於一堂的國際聯盟，早已為我們判定了誰是侵略者，全世界的與論也早一致把侵略者的真面目揭露無遺。可是因為「野蠻」的武器尚在侵略者的手裏，所以是非的定理雖分，我們卻還得以自己的血和肉來證實這定理的為真理。</p>
<p>就常識觀的知識言，也許日本兵士的軍事技術知識要比中國強些，這是因為日本有着這種軍事技術設備，如果中國也有這種高度技術設備，那麼中國士兵的此方面知識，決不會輸於日本。至於就真理觀的知識言，則日本兵士的「文化性」，在南京暴行及他處暴行上，表現得最明白不過了。再看一看Amelets　Veapa　的一個日本間諜（現在「譯報」刊載中），更可曉得日本軍人口中的「文化性」和野蠻人的「獸性」究竟有幾多區別。</p>
<p>名將出於文化人間，是不錯的，如現在中國的最高統帥及其僚屬，就是一例。至於日本在中日戰事十六個月來統帥迭調，（現在又在大調動）足見他們的手忙腳亂，所謂「名將」的醜態，業已暴露無遺。像士肥原那樣的陰謀家，就是日本「名將」的典型-殘忍，橫暴，食狠，缺乏理性，這一切的一切就是日本軍人的智性！</p>
<p>一個民族的文明和野蠻的分野，是決定在一民族的正義觀感及其實踐。對於此次中日戰爭的文明和野蠻的分野，也同樣適用這一解釋，一切的歪曲和掩飾決逃不過真理的照妖鏡。</p>
<h3>飛</h3>
<p>— 季涵</p>
<p>這里不是街，也不算弄堂，更比不上馬路，二座草棚中間的一條泥路，那末，就呌做泥路吧。</p>
<p>這里的住戶，是沒有什麼老爺，太太，小姐，少爺等稱呼的；但新近來了一個人們都呌他為先生的人。他姓鮑，從小三子，小六子，小字上排列起來，於是就呌做小鮑先生。</p>
<p>小鮑先生年齡不過二十幾歲，白晳的臉龐，高高的鼻子，一頭禿了頂朝後梳的頭髪，穿着長袍子，走起路來挺神氣的；但對人卻挺和氣。</p>
<p>在平時，像小鮑先生那樣人物，會在草棚裏出現，該算是奇　了，現在呢，誰都以為他是從戰區裏逃出來暫時住住，亦誰都知道他遲早總要像島兒般飛去的。</p>
<p>但在尚未飛去之前，他總坐在草棚門前讀「新聞」報紙，尤其是好天氣日子的早晨。</p>
<p>「啊，小鮑先生認得字的？」</p>
<p>「呸，不識字怎麼會看報紙呢！」</p>
<p>被槍白的人，紅着臉走了開去。</p>
<p>小鮑先生聽得發笑起來，眼光移到「呸」人家的那個，向他點點頭：</p>
<p>「早！」</p>
<p>「呀，呀，小鮑先生，你早呀！」</p>
<p>「你呌什麼？」</p>
<p>「我的名兒呌榮貴。」兩手搓揑得像煞沒處安放。「我的媽媽呌我小貴兒。」</p>
<p>「哈，哈，好極，好極！」</p>
<p>這一笑，引得小貴兒樂了起來，走近身，也向報紙上瞧呀瞧的。小鮑先生知道他是在瞧着黑人牙膏廣告上的那個黑人，對小貴兒望望，除了焦黃的牙齒不算，臉龐兒倒活像。</p>
<p>「貴兒哥，今年幾歲？」</p>
<p>「十九啦！」</p>
<p>「讀過書？」</p>
<p>搖搖頭。</p>
<p>小鮑先生也知道這一句是多問的。</p>
<p>「一向住在這里嗎？」</p>
<p>「不，去年住在閘北的。」</p>
<p>「家里有幾個人？」</p>
<p>「爸爸，媽媽，我，三個；從前還有個姊姊，後來……」眼圈兒一紅，說不下去。</p>
<p>「後來！怎樣呢？」</p>
<p>「後來在閘北被××……」遲疑一下，「被××殺死了！」說明，透着一臉的憤怒。</p>
<p>小鮑先生心理明白，也不追問下去，把話兒岔開了，同他談些不關緊要的事情，和報上的新聞；一直等到他的媽媽呌他了，方才走開。</p>
<p>從那天起，小貴兒和小鮑先生成了朋友啦，無事的時候，總在一塊兒談着。一般同小貴兒不相上下的小夥兒，都一窩蜂聚攏來，小鮑先生照樣的談着，問着。</p>
<p>早晨和傍晚，這條泥路上，就有成堆的人，在聽小鮑先生的講話：報上的新聞，和他自己的意見，凡是與××有關的消息，他總有聲有色的說着。無疑的，一顆顆堅韌的小心兒，都漸漸的溫暖起來，沸熱起來。</p>
<p>終於在一個黑暗的晚上，小鮑先生認為時機成熟的時候，他就悄悄的帶了十數的熱烈的小戰士，難開了這狹窄的泥路，飛向他們遼闊的征途，做那偉大的工作去了。</p>
<h3>關於「嘉定屠城記」　－明末民眾抗清的報告文學－</h3>
<p>— 楊寬正</p>
<p>「嘉定屠城記」這書，原名「東塘日剳」，也稱「嘉定乙酉紀略」，是一部紀載描寫明朝末年嘉定民眾怎樣的抗戰的！作者朱子素先生，是親歷其境的，他所記的當然是很親切的事實。當明朝末年，吳三桂引清兵南下，漢奸都相繼投誠，及揚州既破，民眾還困守抗戰的，有江陰崑山嘉定松江及金山衛。揚州和嘉定江陰的抗戰，最是熱烈悲壯，而遭屠殺也最厲害，所謂嘉定三屠，揚州十日，當時還有這樣的口頭禪，說是「苦莫苦於嘉定，慘莫慘於江陰！」當時慘痛的情況，是可想而見的！</p>
<p>「東塘日剳」是當時的實錄，是第一流的民族意識的報告文學，作者朱子素先生字九初，補邑庠生，甲申需次禮部，棄去不就，隱居教授，當然是一氣節之士，他還編輯有歷代遺民錄，吳　文獻哀貞錄等，都是富於民族意識的，那朱先生這部描寫嘉定民眾抗戰的作品，當然也富於民族意識的。據我所知，現在這書的刊本有六：</p>
<p>荊駝逸史本</p>
<p>明季稗史本</p>
<p>紀載彙編本</p>
<p>申報館鉛印本</p>
<p>中國內亂外禍叢書本</p>
<p>嘉慶甲子惠塘朱春生抄</p>
<p>稿本</p>
<p>朱春生抄稿本署原名「東塘日剳」，前有朱九初節略，後有甲子正月二十三日夜朱春生跋，今藏嘉定周承忠氏，曾一度鉛印行世，原本在前上海市博物館所開的上海文獻展覽會中會陳列過。把這本和以前的刊本比較，知道以前的刊本都已經清朝人的　改，失掉了本來的面目！而這抄稿本卻是朱子素先生的原稿。</p>
<p>這抄稿本稱民眾的『義兵』為『我軍』，稱『清兵』為『北兵』，凡清廷新封的新貴，也一律不冠『清』而稱『北』。而許多刊本都稱『大清』『清兵』，又稱『豫王』為『大清統軍元帥』，當然不是有民族意識的朱子素先生的手筆。這抄稿本批評當時嘉定的縣令，說縣令錢默『意不在官，人無法紀，』而刊本都刪了！證以嘉定蘇瀜所著『惕齋見聞錄』，也說：</p>
<p>『嘉定新令則南選浙江嘉善之錢不識也，名默，與前曹令同榜進士，在席成為通家子弟，年少以英異聞，及為政事，專尚　削，民多怨　！』</p>
<p>當時縣令錢默，的確是一個剝削民眾的公子哥兒，但是刊本把他的罪狀刪削了，把他的罪惡隱藏了！</p>
<p>這抄稿本稱當時有個呌蔣若來的，真是個忠節之士，說『北兵入南都，若來遁歸，自殺其妻子，入海依義陽王，』他殺了妻子後逃遁入海，是多麼有氣節！而刊本卻稱若來為『市井無賴，以　力遭逢　遺，官至都督，聞維揚陷，棄職回逃，』將若來竟是一個瀆職的無賴了！這抄稿本稱若來『視庫存銅銃數十，使人　之以行，遂由徐家行入海，』他把嘉定所存的重兵器携走，免得資敵，這是撤退時最必要的！而刊本卻又這麼一改，說若來『　　　，僅存銅錢數十千，　之行，過徐家行大掠，寸縷無遺，貧民哭聲震天。』蔣若來竟是個土匪了！清朝人改　的本領，真夠巧妙，把「銅銃數十」改成銅錢數十千，把「遂由徐家行入海」改成「過徐家行大掠」，這樣改還不夠說得壞，於是再添上了『寸縷無遺，貧民哭聲震天』二句！</p>
<p>還有，當外岡婁塘的義兵，和梁得勝大戰時，義兵打了一次大勝仗，在這抄稿本上，描寫得很詳細很活現－－</p>
<p>『惟時我軍幾潰，而外岡婁塘兵接戰甚力，念三都素稱盜藪，其人輕捷敢戰，斬殺最多，漏下數刻，各鄉兵蜂攏而集，競舉燒（梁）得勝船。（李）成棟自下維揚金陵毘陵京口諸處所獲精金美珠，名劍寶刀無數，悉付一炬，其未及燬者，盡為鄉兵掠去，船中多載婦女，被焚甚慘，其中有一女最美麗，呼曰：「我翰林官女，家在揚州，被據至此，幸救我！」鄉兵皆曰：「可躍入水」！女哭曰：「我足被銷不得脫！」語未竟，烈火燒其身矣！烟燄蔽大，红光耀十餘里，天明始熄，得勝夜東奔，狼狽得達。』</p>
<p>這時義兵的襲擊火攻，是多麼神勇！外岡一帶，至今民情還很強悍，平時的匪盜，等到大時代的到來，挺身出而為義勇的豪傑，古今是一轍的！而已經給清人改竄過的刊本，只是寥寥的幾句，說：『天明數得勝兵首級共八十四顆，得勝餘眾東奔，狼狽得達。』</p>
<p>明末清初這類民族意識的作品，經清朝人胡亂改竄，搬弄黑白的地方，真不知有幾許，這「嘉定屠城記」，也是一例。</p>

<h3>新年與新衣</h3>
<p>— 張鎭山</p>
<p>時序的推進，就像是一輛行駛的列車，迅速地又把新年載送到了；在喜悅與歡樂中迎着新年，看着一切事物都在作新的准展，勃然的內心眞有不可言喻的愉快，與奮，欣幸，得意！奔波終年的生活追求者又將以娛樂去洗刷終年的勞頓與疲困，而同時，私生活上也就必然的要作起新的表現了。</p>
<p>無論是什麼階層的人物，在新年裹最顯明的動態就是換新衣，即使是窮措大，耶使是寒酸的小子，也必須換穿一身比較整潔的衣服，這在表面上以自大的口吻說，似乎未免有些俗氣，其實，新年穿新衣除了作應景的點綴外，還隱含着許多深刻的意識，它有：一元復始，萬象更新的表現，有增加喜悅和愉快的象徵，有鼓勵人民作新的努力和進展的力量，有調劑苦悶精神的優點。</p>
<p>所以，新年裹穿新衣，不獨是上海，不獨是中國，並且，全世界上任何一個民族都有這種風俗和習慣，這好像是天賦的一種知覺和行動，到了這個時候不愛修飾的人也自然的會修飾起來。經濟最富裕的富翁，太太，小姐，少爺，就穿着簇嶄全新的高貴衣服，其决的也會穿較次的新衣，更次的也有比較價賤的新衣，質料的劃分雖然是以經濟環境為背景，但其意義則是相同的。</p>
<h3>豆腐和豆腐漿</h3>
<p>— 雙溪一葉</p>
<p>『說起冬天，忽然想到豆腐。是一「小洋鍋」（鋁鍋）白煮豆腐，熱騰騰的。水滾着，像好些魚眼睛。一小塊一小塊豆腐養在裏面，嫩而滑，彷彿反穿白狐大衣。———父親說晚上冷，吃了大家暖和些。我們都歡喜這種白水豆腐。……』</p>
<p>上面這一段話是文學研究者朱自淸先生在他的那篇題名呌做「冬天」裹告訴我們的。</p>
<p>豆腐！豆腐！世人都歡喜吃豆腐，而不知道豆腐之所以爲豆腐。</p>
<p>據一位食物營養研究者說，這種做豆腐的荳，含有蛋白質的成分最多，而且其他各種人身所需要的營養素，亦復包含不少。可見要各種條件俱備的食物，在豆腐中可以取之不竭。如果用更現代些的術語來講，那未維他命ABC………以至於X或N（雖然有的尙未發明）都有成分包容在內，實為補品中的『跑龍套』也！別的補品光有維他命C而沒有A，或允有A而缺乏B；掛一漏萬，比比皆是，與豆腐不可同日而語。吾則朱自淸吃豆腐也何必寫豆腐。惟其要寫；大概『良有以也』也。</p>
<p>豆腐的『忘年交』，便是豆腐漿。論閱歷，當然豆腐比較老練，論素質，那又不能不先輪到豆腐漿。</p>
<p>豆腐有老有嫩，而豆腐則嫩到再無可嫩的流動體了。可說尙未出「釜」（？）閣的小家碧玉，宜人之處，益人的生活力，大概不是三言兩語所可詳</p>
<p>至於價格的低廉，進用起來的便當，消化的容易，尤其餘事。實為大衆冬令無上補品</p>
<h3>送禮的故事</h3>
<p>— 書</p>
<p>說起送禮，眞是難題！往往有人出了很貴的代價，自己認為非常滿意的名貴東盡它的　惠黎庶的。雖然吃豆腐也並不要用牙齒，但比之豆漿總得耍多搬一些唇舌。所以豆腐宜於當餐，而豆腐漿則適於小吃——點心。</p>
<p>點心中含有這樣富於營養素的滋補品，實在少見。它的功效。。旣可以潤肺淸血，又可以健脾養胃；牛奶色的面孔人人都愛；凝脂一般的皮膚，誰不艷羨；這些都從豆腐漿裹吃出來的。豆腐西施，豈徒然哉西，誰知結果是，受的人連正眼兒也不覷它一覷，豈非怪事？舉一個例吧：從前滬寗鐵路車務總管英人克蘭埃氏，是愛吸雪茄烟的。一條滬寗路上，什麼東西不需要？什麼東西不由客商承包着？一到新年時節，又那一家客商不為自己下一年的營業打算，而不去奉承他——送一分厚厚的冬至禮？友人孫君，是包的黃沙和碎石，起初年年買了很高貴的雪茄烟去送給克氏，他總哈哈地笑納了，或者說一聲「謝你」。有一决禮送得晏了些，克氏恰不在家，一個僕役正在把一箱一箱的雪茄烟打開來。孫君從丟在一旁的烟箱上，一望而知，都是些很名貴的來路貨，自己買來的牌子也有在內。「為什末把它們倒在簍子中去呢？」，他懷疑極了，問那個僕役，原來正都是人家送來的冬至禮呀。因為克氏自己不愛吸，所以都把來浸在水缸中，預備去做培壅花樹的肥料用。他吏奇怪了，只得再請敎那僕役，才知克氏吸的雪茄烟，上海只有一家洋行經理着，也只有極少數的幾位有名人物去吸它；你若不說明是買了送給他們這幾位吸的呢，你就休想買得到。孫君得到了這意想不到的消息，忙把一團興致帶去的禮物拿了就走，親自到仁記洋行去，申說了來意，這一决果然給他達到了目的，就連夜趕到克氏家中送給克氏，克氏一見送他的正是心愛的東西，馬上笑逐顏開地伸出手來，同他緊緊地握着，還不斷地說：一謝謝你！」「謝謝你的美意！」孫君這一樂，眞是非同小可。從此一帆風順，直到克氏去職，他承包的黃沙碎石，始終不曾受到什麼意外，都是這小小一箱雪茄烟的功勞！</p>

<h3>一星期經濟菜單</h3>
<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>慚愧得很！在這歲聿更新的季節，沒有甚麼好菜貢獻與謮者諸君。雞，我所欲也：鴨，亦我所欲也；可是翻遍了我的菜單，竟像寶貝一般找尋不到，為來為去，就為的經濟而已。這幾天翻閱本報，己可見到菜館中所登全生電鍋的廣吿，未免食指大動：然而在家常菜中來一下子，又不合經濟條件；何况家裏有電鍋的，恐怕也不多吧。現在為了聊以殺饞起見，我們來一個十景小火鍋，將牛肉片，洋葱絲，雞雜或鴨雜，線粉，豆腐，塔菜或菠菜等，加醬油猪油紅燒透熟，便盛在洋鐵小鍋子裹，擱在小風爐上邊燙邊吃，比了吃全生更為入味，便是日本式的「斯蓋阿蓋」也比不上呢。謮者諸君要是胃口不好，何妨一嘗試之。</p>

<h3>成都在衣食住行</h3>
<p>— 徐爾音</p>
<p>衣在廣東和廣西，我們所看到的都是短裝，長衫難得有人着；但是在成都，我們所看到的都是長衫，穿短裝是稀有的，恰巧相反。成都還通行馬褂，而且不但中老人才用，年靑人也省不了，我的一個同學，過去在上海時西裝呢帽，回到成都四年，就輕綢袍，黑馬褂，頭戴瓜皮小帽子了。公務人員自然是着中山裝的，但因為大半公務人員都有點弓背形，胸部永遠挺不出來，所以穿着中山裝還是打不起精神。學生，自然是一律的灰色芝蔴布學生裝，但四川的學生時常進茶店，打開項頸上的扣子，把皮帶按在茶几上，像心縱意地坐不像坐睡不像睡般倒在竹椅子裹，這樣子可比長杉馬褂的遺少更不上眼。</p>
<p>女人的衣服則和各處一樣，從古代起到歐化，都可以看到。</p>
<p>在街上，特別引起初來者的注目的是喇嘛們，暗紅色的長袍。普通回族的衣，跟他們的食住行一樣，是完全跟我們相同的。</p>
<p>食　說起成都的食這一門來，眞是一紙難盡。川菜是有名的，不用說；更使人念念不忘的却是要到了成都才能嘗到的許多小吃。</p>
<p>到成都的第一晚我就被我的同學邀進一家小吃店，招牌上寫着「吳抄手」，我心裹想，大概由出色的姓吳的厨司得名的吧，一聽同學呌「抄手兩份」，才知道抄手是一種食品，問同學，原來抄手者，餛飩也，廣東店裏的雲吞是也。除了吳抄手，還有矮子抄手葉得貴，都是乾净的，但是小小的門面，却都是刻客滿；自然名不虛傳，小小的一碗管敎你討添。那味道是說不出的。總之，跟成都所有的小吃有幾個共同的好處：價廉是其一，物美是其二，吃不飽是其三。</p>
<p>荔枝巷的水餃子可惜一定要加大量的「紅一，不會吃辣的吃起來，美味就讓辣味趕走了</p>
<p>蒸餃子一客十隻，只可抵有處的一隻至兩隻，全部放在嘴裹，也不嫌多。頓湯圓和廿四春，湯圓之佳，無出其右。</p>
<p>總而言之，成都是一個古色古香的頹廢的城市，成都有的是不傷脾胃的「頹廢的點心」，如周作人先生所說，惜乎周先生竟不想到北平之外還有這樣一個好地方。</p>
<p>住　自然，成都也有貧民窟，那是在城外和遠處。</p>
<p>在城內，截然不同，歐化的是春熙路商業塲上的商店，古風，存的則是少城這一邊的住宅區的大中小公館。</p>
<p>公館無論大中小，第一，門斗一定很像樣，第二門口一定懸一盞紅燈，第三，在頭門與二門之間一定坐一個白髮的門頭。這門頭也許是半身不遂的。也許是雙目失明的，而且十個有九個愛打瞌睡，所以進出的人是不致於每决都受阻擋的，據說，這僅僅是為了耍使「公館像偭公館了」。</p>
<p>進得二門，你可以看見一兩株枯樹，三四枝細竹，五六盆菊花，於是，一個寬大的客堂，一個死氣沉况的院子。</p>
<p>成都人的住，大概和他們的行一樣，也是保持着十足的官僚氣的。</p>
<p>行　成都人少出門。成都九里三分，他們說他們自己就在這九里三分內打一生團團。一出牛市口便變成了不得了，到上海也呌留學，在省府裹就可以領到留學費。留學回來無不爭聘，在外面學了些什麼在所不問。</p>
<p>但成都人還是不愛行動。他們拾不得安安逸逸閒閒散散的成都。</p>
<p>成者人走在街上，大半是沒有什麼事的，也許是剛從茶店裏出來，也許是要到什麼「得意樓」「顧和園」「不如歸」去品茗。他們總是走得非常之慢，所以，連人力車也只好慢慢的走，因為人行道和馬路除了有要人經過的時候是不分的，馬路中央一樣有悠然的散步者。</p>
<p>成都汽車少，人力車多而賤幾可為全國冠，有馬有騾有諸公車，有轎，有滑竿，有木船，有木炭公路車，蜀道不難，難在缺少現代交通工具而巳，但也還行得。</p>

<p>游藝界</p>
<h3>百戲略說</h3>
<p>— 粒民</p>
<p>江湖　技，種類頗多，或用器，或用畜，總稱百戲，一稱雜劇，考其起源，由夾巳久，後漢書有日罷魚龍蔓衍白戲；唐書稱寶歷二年九月觀白戲於宣和殿，三日而罷；則白戲之名，漢巳有之。意者賣技獻藝，至漢而完備，故貴為天子，常加觀賞，惟後世梨園旣盛，此種百戲，日趨沒落，且習之者多草野莽夫，不登大雅，故不為世人所重視矣。</p>
<p>百戲之用器表演者，古有扛鼎尋橦吞刀履火等；今所流行者，則有頂　三上吊走繩索呑劍吃鐵蛋搶刀門等大套戲法，常能吸引觀衆。頂　三上吊走繩索，多係女子表演。吞劍吃鐵蛋搶刀門，多係男子表演；世人所稱二套半數法者，即指此男子表演之技術也。大概女子表演，以矯捷為其特長，而男子表演，則以運氣為其特長。</p>
<p>至於用畜表演，可分猴戲馬戲兩種，猴戲起源最早，禮樂記擾雜子女注擾獼猴也，霄舞者如　猴戲也，蓋弄猴為戲，春秋時巳有之。弄猴者敎猴動作，導以鑼鼓，使之戴帽穿衣騎羊推車抬轎等以娛人。馬戲起源亦古，鹽鐵論有馬戲鬥虎語；三國志甄皇后傳汪，后年八歲，外有立騎馬戲者，家人皆上閣視之，后獨不行；可知馬戲演變，歷時甚久。馬戲較猴戲為繁複而精采，或以身下馬，以手攀鞍而上者，謂之廳馬。或手握定鐙袴，以從後鞦往來，謂之跳馬。或以身離鞍，屆右脚，掛馬騌，左脚在鐙右手把騌，謂之獻鞍，或擲脚着地，倒拖順馬而走，俯拾地下物，復跳上馬者，謂之拖馬。此種技術，與西洋馬戲班之表演者，大同小異。</p>
<p>表演百戲者，賣技各地，常佐以猴戲馬戲而成一班，藉以點綴。彼輩多籍隸鹽早，每年正月十六日，必於鹽城縣西之古基寺，（離城六十里）集會三日，北達魯南，南至浙西，賣技者威來集會，船舶雲集，無慮數百，期滿散歸，因之古基寺附近晨家，多以賣技為副業也。古基寺乃一小村落耳，周的百餘家，賣技之家，當子女五六歲時，即敎以各種技術，如跟飛脚翻筋斗等，及長則依其性別，進授其他技術，亦有撫育養子女，而敎以技術，及長則恃以為生矣。</p>
<p>表演百戲者，不為世所重視，與西洋海京伯馬戲班之聞名全球者，似不可同日語矣。閒嘗加以論列，深以吾國白戲營業之衰微，的有數因：一日資本薄弱，若輩往往導具破舊，氣魄狹小，不圖改進。二曰技術陳舊，大多秉其師承，出而獻技，絕不謀研究改良，更無　用科學上技術者。三曰覽座方法之有待改進也，觀衆納資入門之後，主其事者，又一再向人索錢，致予人以不良之印象。平心論之，此種白戲，乃最適合我國農村民衆之娛樂口味；蓋廣塲之上，圍地十畝，鳴鑼以戲技，輕而易舉，不若都市劇塲之需若干建築費也。願世之關心民衆娛樂者，起而謀改進之道也可。</p>
<h3>一個劃時代的劇人　古寒女士訪問記</h3>
<p>— 鐵流</p>
<p>「古寒小姐一向在上海的嗎？」我問。</p>
<p>「上海也和我有過不少時間的認識，這决，我到上海還不久呢。」她國語很淸脆。</p>
<p>「女士過去在那兒？」</p>
<p>「過去我眞的可算是一個人生的旅行者。」她微笑着，不說下去，我露着希冀聽下去的神情，她便繼續着：「南京，北平，福建，成都，連雲港，和江南江北等處，最近，不比從前那般的方便了，我也做了困居孤島的一人。」</p>
<p>「女士見聞旣多，人生經騐</p>
<p>酷冷的季節中，上海話劇界也冰凍般的沉寂。異軍突起的紅星劇團，第一個節目上演「在歡之夜」。演員的名單中，不少是很生疏的。這一個新的組織，我們當然很希望有新人才的發現。飾縣長女兒那個要角的，是古寒小姐。這名字太生疏了，經友人介紹相見之下，生疏的名字，給予我一個深刻的印象。</p>
<p>當然豐富，參加劇運，表演人生，是最合於劇運的需要的。請問女士，過去研究什麼的？可會在什麼地方上演過話劇？</p>
<p>「慚愧得很，雖然跑了不少的地方，可是一無所長。我最愛好音樂，我會在專科學校攻習過，當我畢業了師範之後。在連雲港曾經盤大的演出過歌劇：話劇也曾嘗試過好幾决。</p>
<p>她是很富有東方趣味的一位姑娘，談吐舉止顯然的大方而沒有一絲兒習氣；她又微笑着說：「人生應該嚴肅些，一般的所謂「摩登」，似乎太缺少置善美的人生目的了。」</p>
<p>「聽說吳村導演認為女士是千百人中最能表情的一個，怎麼女士不想上上銀幕？」</p>
<p>「好說！我那兒有這才能，好的多着呢！辛酸苦辣的人生味兒，給我許多深刻印象而巳！」女士有些感觸了。</p>
<p>「女士演出在歡之夜這個劇，有什麼感想嗎？」</p>
<p>「我能有什麼感想！太見重了！不過一個人總要認淸自己的立塲。這多够哲學趣味的答語，古塞小姐眞好像一棵幽靜的水仙，亭亭直立的荷花。</p>
<p>一女士喜歡起那一類的角色？」我問。　「我想都得要嘗試，可是胡調而無意識的，我最討厭他。</p>
<p>「女士現在演的角色怎樣？」我又問。</p>
<p>「不怎樣。多動作的比較難演些，往往不容易討好，道就是說，一般觀衆易於忽略過去，識者當然不在此例。」她很莊嚴地。</p>
<p>「女士累了！女士用嚴肅的立塲來努力，是藝術界不可多得的收穫。」</p>
<p>在「再見」聲中，留下了富有經騐而活潑大方的印象。</p>
<p>（銅圖：古寒女士）</p>
<h3>談談無線電話劇　（續）</h3>
<p>— 陳大悲</p>
<p>不錯無線電話劇的聽衆自甘退處於瞎子的地位，猶之乎從前默片時代的觀衆自甘退處於聾子的地位一樣地無聊。但是有許多愛聽某一種地方戲的上海朋友們曾經吿訴我說：他們先從收音機裹聽到那種戲的時候，因為方言熟諳的關係，覺得美不堪言；及至看到同樣一班演員在大會串的舞台上表演出來，方纔發覺他們原來是一羣俗不可耐醜不堪言的「流氓」，於是乎連他們的播音都不頗意去收聽了。</p>
<p>是的，我們從聽覺裹引起的想像的美一定比我們從視覺裹激起的現象的美耍美到萬倍。筆者在六年前組織過一個無綫電話劇團體，呌做「上海觀音劇社。」在那個社裹有一位天津小姐嗓音是非常的圓潤和秀麗，聲調是非常的富有情感和力量。她的力量能够吊出同伴們的眼淚，引得大家抽抽噎噎地哭一個沒有完。她又是那樣地聰敏，能够把從未寓目過的新劇本讀得每一句每一字都充分地能表現出編劇者所希望她表現的情緒來，引得無數聽衆不由自主地寫信來誇獎她的表演藝術。甚至於有許多色情在的靑年竟在投情書，要求和她會一次面。她讀完了道些無聊的信之後總是向火爐或是字簍裹一投，從來沒有寫過回信的。但是有一天晚上，她在電台播昔完畢之後，無端地大哭起來。經我再四追問之後，她纔給我看一封具名的情書，的定她第二天上午十點鐘在法國公園晤談，倘再失望他立刻就要去跳黃浦。她失却了主意，要我簪她解决這個「救人一命勝造七級浮屠」的問題·這一回我却勸她去了。去了回來之後，她叉大哭不止。原來她的美的成份完全在她的穎悟和聲調上，而她的姿態和面貌巳能使那位投情書的靑年對她不發一言，向她深深鞠了一躬，揚長而去，大的他是再也捨不得去跳黃浦了。　（完）</p>
<p>無綫電話劇的特長就在這一點，能够引出你理想中的最高標準的美——就是崔鶯鶯和林黛玉……那樣的美——任何明星或是大王所扮不出來的美</p>
<p>關於無綫電話劇的編製，表演，配音等種種問題緩日再談。</p>
<h3>「職婦劇團」將演「女子公寓」</h3>
<p>上海中國職業婦女俱樂部，爲上海各職業婦女所組織，自開辦以來，成續斐然，各項娛樂部門，更形活躍。話劇組且於最近發展成為「職婦劇團，」並於日前參加徵寡難民給養之四團體聯合公演三天，好評潮湧，口碑載道。現該劇團定於本月十五日（星期日）假座寗波旅滬同鄉會日夜公演四慕劇「女子公寓，」該劇導演吳湄在劇運上有悠久之歷史，凡稍稍留心製運者，無不知之，此决本其心得，出任導演，勝任愉快，自不待言也。</p>
<h3>過年的笑話</h3>
<p>從前封建時代的官塲中人，最喜歡聽吉祥話，尤其是在除夕的夜裹，同元旦的早晨，更注意這事。某公館裹用着一個下人，名呌高升，這人極頑皮不過，常常把老爺氣得要死；但是官塲的規矩非到年底不能辭人，眼看除夕將近，主人决意明年不再用他了。誰知到了除夕這大，上下人等都忙的個不亦樂乎，及至敬罷神後，巳經磕過送歲頭啦，主人忽然想起耍辭高升這事，升兒是個機靈鬼，一瞧眼色不對，沒等主人開口，他先跑到老爺跟前，打了一個扞兒，問道「老爺明年還要高升吾」？老爺一想，說這小子眞可惡，剛辭過歲，到了新年這一邊，頭一句話怎能說明年老爺不要高陞呢，連忙笑嘻嘻的答道：「老爺要高陞，要高陞」。高升背過臉來，對着他的同伴道：「我高升又幹一年」。　（慕雲）</p>
<h3>故都宮闈棃園秘史　（六）（五）</h3>

<h3>Japan Feels Increasingly Uneasy Domestically - Konoe Cabinet Suddenly Collapses - Fascist Leader Hiranuma Kiichirō Organizes New Cabinet - Stock Exchange Prices Plummet After New Year Opening</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Konoe convened a cabinet meeting at 10:30 this morning. After the meeting, he entered the Imperial Palace at 11:30 to submit the cabinet's resignation to the Emperor. Chief Cabinet Secretary Akira Kazami also formally announced the news. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Hiranuma, having been ordered to form a cabinet, requested a period of consideration and then left the palace to begin the task. He appointed Tanabe as Chief Cabinet Secretary and invited Kazuo Ishiwata, a senior official from the Ministry of Finance, to serve as Minister of Finance. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The latest predictions for new cabinet members are: Arita as Foreign Minister, Kido as Home Minister, Ishiwata as Finance Minister, Itagaki as Army Minister, Yonai as Navy Minister, Shiono as Justice Minister, Araki as Education Minister, and Hatta as Colonial Affairs Minister. The ministerial posts for Communications, Railways, Agriculture, Commerce, and Industry, and Welfare will be distributed among important politicians. Seiyukai party leader Machida and Minseitō party leader Maeda, among others, are expected to join the cabinet. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) At 9:42 PM tonight, Privy Council President Hiranuma was summoned to the Imperial Palace and ordered to form a cabinet. Baron Hiranuma Kiichirō, age 73, has served on the Privy Council for ten years. He previously served as a judicial official in the Saionji Cabinet and as Minister of Justice in 1933. In recent years, whenever there has been talk of a change in government, Hiranuma has been mentioned as a possible successor to the prime ministership. After the Emperor accepted Konoe's resignation, he summoned Minister of the Imperial Household Yasakira Taira to seek his opinion on potential successors. Yasakira requested to consult with elder statesman Saionji before reporting back. He then took a train to Yanatsu and is expected to return to Kyoto tonight at 9:00 PM to report. According to predictions from the Asahi Shimbun, if Hiranuma is ordered to form a cabinet, Konoe will become President of the Privy Council and a Minister without Portfolio. Incumbent cabinet members expected to remain are Army Minister Itagaki, Navy Minister Yonai, Foreign Minister Arita, and Welfare Minister Kido. Those expected to resign are Finance Minister Ikeda, Home Minister (undecided), Agriculture Minister Arima, Communications Minister Nagai, and Railways Minister Nakajima. The positions of Education Minister Araki and Colonial Affairs Minister Hatta are uncertain. Hiranuma's cabinet will invite the Minseitō and Seiyukai parties to join. Former Privy Councilor of the "Manchukuo" government, Tanabe, will become a cabinet member or Chief Cabinet Secretary. After the New Year holiday, the stock market reopened this morning. Due to Konoe's resignation, prices plummeted. When Konoe entered the Imperial Palace this morning, Chief Cabinet Secretary Kazami officially announced the cabinet's resignation. Konoe then released a statement after his resignation, stating that in June 1937, when he first took office, the China Incident broke out and has since become increasingly serious, leading to a complex situation both domestically and internationally. Now that the China Incident has entered a new phase, it is time for the Japanese government to focus its efforts on creating a new order to maintain peace in East Asia. He believes that it is necessary for the new cabinet to formulate new policies to increase public trust. As for the Japanese government's unshakable fundamental policy on the China Incident, it has already been established and approved by the Emperor. He fears that his abilities are not up to the task and has therefore submitted his cabinet's resignation. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The army and navy here believe that in order to cope with the crisis in China, it is necessary to establish a centralized government. The Konoe Cabinet, under pressure from the army and navy, has decided to resign en masse today. Well-informed sources believe that this is not unexpected. Fascist sympathizers within Japan, such as the undecided Home Minister, are prepared to dissolve the Diet and merge all domestic political parties into one to create a simple, centralized rule. According to observers here, Konoe Cabinet's decision to resign comes at Japan's most critical juncture in history, as Japan's relationship with China and third countries continues to deteriorate, especially with the United Kingdom and the United States. External relations are not expected to improve. In addition to diplomatic relations, there are many serious problems that need to be resolved by the new government. (Associated Press, 4th)</p>
<h3>China's Determination to Resist Remains Strong, Unaffected by Japanese Political Turmoil - Konoe and Wang Jingwei's Secret Negotiations Fail - Japanese Domination Will Be Increasingly Controlled by Warlords</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) A Chinese spokesperson stated today at a press conference that the resignation of the Japanese cabinet is tantamount to a public admission of the failure of the war in China over the past eighteen months, and that it also shows the dominance of radicals who believe that Japan must place the entire nation on a full war footing in order to continue fighting. Their fundamental policy towards China will hardly change. On the contrary, they will intensify their military operations. In terms of diplomacy, Japan will make further attempts to consolidate an anti-communist bloc and will have even less regard for the rights of third countries. As far as China is concerned, the change in the Japanese cabinet will have little impact, as China is fully prepared to continue its resistance. Since Japan is being controlled by new radicals, the day of Japan's collapse is drawing closer. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources here, Prime Minister Konoe's resignation was due to the following reasons: (1) Konoe's speech on December 22 failed to produce the results he expected, so he resigned to take responsibility. (2) Japanese political parties fought hard for their own existence. It is generally expected that right-wing elements will dominate the Japanese press to intensify the war against China and close the door to peace talks. It is rumored that Konoe, as a result of secret negotiations with Wang Jingwei, issued a peace speech on December 22, hoping that China would respond under Wang Jingwei's instigation. Even if Wang Jingwei could not obtain the full agreement of the government, it was anticipated that the Chinese government could be seriously divided, thereby promoting the path to reconciliation. Unexpectedly, Wang Jingwei's attempt was isolated and weak, and the Chinese government adopted swift and resolute measures. The whole country unanimously supported Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to continue the war of resistance. Konoe and Wang Jingwei's peace movement completely failed, leading to serious condemnation. At the same time, the proposal to merge all political parties into one would completely eliminate the Seiyukai and Minseitō parties. Although these two parties have given up everything to the military in the past few years, they cannot make a final struggle when their survival is threatened. In the future, the new Japanese cabinet will definitely have full fascist characteristics, and all its powers will be controlled by warlords. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Asahi Shimbun stated that the main reason for Konoe's resignation was the failure of the movement to organize a unified political party and implement the national mobilization plan. After Foreign Minister Ugaki submitted his resignation last September, Konoe had already decided to resign, but was ultimately forced by circumstances to continue in office. When the movement to unify political parties and implement the National General Mobilization Law, to which the Prime Minister paid close attention, failed, he decided to leave. However, Japan's policy towards China will not change due to the cabinet reshuffle. On the contrary, its policy towards China will be more active than before. (Dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Nichi-Nichi Shimbun stated that Hiranuma has always believed in nationalism. If he were to form a cabinet during a time of peace and the rise of liberalism, all sectors would be shocked. Now that Japan is at war and economic controls have been strengthened, some believe that the new cabinet will not make drastic changes to Japan's economic structure. (Dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The resignation of the Japanese Konoe Cabinet has been commented on by observers here as follows: The war between China and Japan has become more difficult to end, and the confrontational situation between the United States and Japan has intensified. People generally believed that the Sino-Japanese war was moving towards compromise. Konoe's China policy announced on December 22 last year, although severely criticized by the French side as unacceptable, after Wang Jingwei sent a telegram to General Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Chinese Military Commission, on the 29th of that month, it was believed here that some Chinese leaders were willing to conduct peace negotiations with Japan. At the same time, it was also believed that Japan, due to many domestic difficulties, should adopt a compromising attitude towards the Chinese government. Unexpectedly, strong hardliners in Tokyo, fearing that China and Japan would reach a compromise, forced the Konoe Cabinet to collapse. The Chinese side unanimously condemned Wang Jingwei's peace telegram. Based on this, the Japanese cabinet reshuffle will certainly not help peace in the Far East. On the contrary, the country's ambitions in the Far East will definitely expand further. As for the United States, the government has clearly stated that it can hardly accept Konoe's proposal to establish a new order in East Asia. Its opposition to Japan will inevitably become stronger. U.S. President Roosevelt will soon submit a message to Congress explaining foreign policy, and its content is of great concern to French observers. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The news of the resignation of the Japanese Konoe Cabinet caused great surprise among German political circles here. Although it was expected that the Konoe Cabinet would not last long, it was unexpected that it would collapse so quickly. As the news was received late, most newspapers did not have time to comment. However, the semi-official German News Agency issued detailed news on the situation of the Japanese political situation. It is generally believed that after Konoe's resignation, his successor will be Privy Council President Hiranuma, in order to strengthen the concentration of national strength and implement "Japan's great plan." In addition, German officials have expressed their views with extreme reservation, only stating that Konoe made a statement after his resignation, emphasizing that Japan must form a new cabinet and implement new policies in order to restore national confidence. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Property Bombing Case - Japan Still Trying to Evade Responsibility - Ministry of Foreign Affairs Responds to U.S. Protest, Saying No Responsibility for Lack of Markings</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement regarding the U.S. note on the bombing of American properties in China, declaring that it is not responsible. The reason given is that the American properties that were bombed did not have formal markings, so it was impossible to identify them as American properties from the air. The Japanese note further stated that several American properties that were destroyed were near legitimate military objectives, so the Japanese government is not responsible for the erroneous bombing of the aforementioned properties by Japanese pilots. In short, the Japanese note refuses to take responsibility for the bombing of thirteen American properties in China by Japanese aircraft. This note is a response to the protest submitted by the United States on December 29. Observers here believe that U.S.-Japan relations are about to reach a critical stage. (Associated Press, 4th)</p>

It is expected that a meeting will be convened within a few days to enhance the connection between leaders in the southwest. The main topic is the connection and unification of economic relations in the southwest. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The chairmen of Guizhou and Sichuan provinces will soon meet with government leaders here. Wu Dingchang, the chairman of Guizhou Province, has arrived in Chongqing from Guiyang. Wang Jixu, the chairman of Sichuan Province, is expected to fly here from Chengdu on Friday. (Reuters, 4th)</p>

It will be used exclusively for the development of rich resources in the southwest provinces. It will be officially announced after the fund guarantee is determined and approved by the State Council. (Express News Agency, 4th)</p>
<h3>All Parties Still Hope He Awakens - Final Advice to Wang - Central Government is Lenient and Has Not Issued an Arrest Warrant - Turning Back is the Right Path, Do Not Leave Behind National Disgrace - It is Internally Determined that Sun Lian Will Succeed as Vice President - No Arrests of Political Prisoners in Chongqing</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Fallen Dispatch: A certain important person said that the central government has not immediately issued an arrest warrant for Wang Jingwei, which is a sign of leniency. Many people who have a deep personal friendship with Wang are still performing their duties as usual and are expressing anger at Wang's actions. They hope that he will go to Europe to rest and recover, to seek forgiveness from the people. Many people, including so-and-so, have sent telegrams to Wang in their personal capacities, offering final advice, hoping that he will no longer act recklessly and bring shame to the nation. The generals have sent telegrams in support of the central government's handling of Wang. It is internally determined that Sun Ke will be the Vice President. (Special Dispatch, 5th, 1:00 AM)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Shao Lizi said that the central government will have further expressions regarding Wang Jingwei, depending on how he acts in the future. The central government's handling of Wang's case is strict and lenient. There are many friends of Wang in the central government who are still performing their duties as usual. (Special Dispatch, 4th, 6:00 PM)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) It is rumored that Wang Jingwei is very frustrated about being expelled from the party. He is now trying to ease the atmosphere of opposition and plans to sacrifice a certain Chen and a certain Lin, and have Gu Mengyu issue a public statement. I believe that the telegram on the 29th was Wang's original intention, but it was actually Chen and Lin who acted on their own authority. Wang will issue a second statement, the content of which will still express support for peace. (Special Dispatch, 4th, 11:00 PM)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Senators staying in Hong Kong are very angry at Wang Jingwei's actions. Zhang Yi said that he plans to invite the senators to hold a meeting once a week to exchange opinions. The third Senate meeting was originally scheduled to be held in Chongqing this month, but now that the Speaker has left, the central government is considering a successor. The meeting may be postponed to February. (Special Dispatch, 4th, 11:00 PM)</p>
<p>(Changsha) All sectors in Hunan were extremely indignant upon hearing the news of Wang's advocacy of peace. They convened a meeting on the 4th to plan a rally to support the war of resistance and punish Wang for his treachery. (Dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>Kunming: Since the Wang case occurred, public sentiment has been outraged. The Yunnan Provincial Steering Committee, the Anti-Japanese Association, and other organizations sent telegrams to Chairman Chiang on the 4th, expressing their respects and supporting the central government's resolution to remove Wang from the party and dismiss him from his post. (Dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Where is Wang Jingwei? Various rumors are circulating here, but it seems that the report received by the Japanese side from Hanoi is more credible. The report stated that Wang and five others are currently in the suburbs of Hanoi. Because Wang has been expelled from the party by the Central Executive Committee, he is not convenient to have any contact with the Chinese Consulate General in Hanoi. It is rumored that Zhou Fohai is also with Wang in Hanoi. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to reliable sources, the National Government considers the Wang Jingwei incident to be over. In the event that Wang begins negotiations with Japan, the National Government will punish Wang and his followers. There are currently no plans to make further statements. The rumor that 200 of Wang's followers were arrested in Chongqing is completely unfounded and has been refuted by the authorities. (Haitong Dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to late news from Hanoi received by related parties, Wang Jingwei was still in a hospital in Hanoi as of the evening of the 2nd of this month. Du Yuesheng, Qian Xinzhi, Wang Xiaolai and others have flown to Hanoi from Kunming on a special plane, but the purpose is unknown. However, according to general speculation, Du and others are going there to persuade Wang Jingwei to abandon his "peace" intentions and continue to support the central government. (Express News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to foreign sources, Wang Jingwei held a meeting with Itagaki and senior Japanese military officers here yesterday to discuss the reorganization of the puppet organizations in Peiping and Nanjing. It is rumored that Wang will take office as the puppet "President", Wu Peifu will serve as the puppet "Chairman of the Military Commission", and Jin Yunpeng will serve as the puppet "Prime Minister". In recent days, there has been a lot of communication between Peiping and Wang. (Express News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to predictions from Chinese sources here, the position of Vice President of the Kuomintang, which Wang Jingwei left vacant after his escape, may remain vacant. According to the original proposal passed by the National Kuomintang Temporary Congress in Hankou last year, only Chairman Chiang Kai-shek was elected as President, and there was no mention of a Vice President. Later, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek personally recommended Wang Jingwei, and he was then elected to the position. However, there were many who opposed it at the time. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) A Chinese spokesperson, in response to questions from reporters at a press conference, stated that no political prisoners had been arrested in the past week. He also stated that if female reporters wanted to meet with any important leaders, the government was willing to arrange for them to meet. When reporters asked if political prisoners had been arrested elsewhere, the spokesperson replied that only Japan had done so. He also said that the government had not received any telegrams from Wang Jingwei himself since he left Chongqing. (Reuters, 4th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Resignation of the Japanese Cabinet</h3>
<p>The news of the resignation of the Japanese Konoe Cabinet was slightly heard at the beginning of this year, but unexpectedly, when Konoe convened the first cabinet meeting of this year on January 4th yesterday, he had already decided on the total resignation of the cabinet and immediately asked the Japanese Emperor for approval. In China, when Wang Jingwei, who was acting as an echo of "Konoe's Peace," was severely reprimanded by the people of the whole country, his "Konoe's Peace" mechanism collapsed at the same time. This is particularly worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>Since Konoe formed his cabinet in June of the year before last, the war against China immediately broke out. The Japanese warlords used large-scale military offensive means to try to destroy China in one fell swoop, while Konoe often released clever "peace" arguments, using political conspiracies to cover up their aggressive traces with a gesture of relaxation in the international arena. He was naturally a powerful pillar of the Japanese wartime cabinet, but why is this pillar now collapsing itself? According to Konoe's own declaration, the reason for the cabinet's resignation is that "the current incident has entered a new situation and reached a period where all efforts should be devoted to building a new order, and the current cabinet is afraid that it will not be able to cope," so it is necessary to resign. This statement is of course a respectable excuse, but it is not difficult for us to speculate on the internal truth from various aspects.</p>
<p>First, we can assert that the inability of the Konoe Cabinet to sustain itself is due to the pressure of internal fascist warlord forces. As a result of the eighteen-month war against China by the Japanese warlords, the people have been impoverished and their wealth exhausted, and there is still no solution to the military situation. Naturally, they can only increase their power even more frantically. This requires more military spending and greater military control power. However, the former will inevitably lead to a panic in Japanese finance, while the latter will inevitably subject the lives of all Japanese people and the activities of all public and private organizations to stricter intervention by the military. Even the Japanese political parties themselves must be dominated by fascist warlords as much as possible. So how can the Konoe Cabinet itself cope with this new situation? Therefore, reports that the cause of the cabinet upheaval is related to the "political national mobilization" advocated by Interior Minister Makida, who has a deep fascist tendency, shows that the Japanese warlords' anxiety over the war against China has first caused a new change in domestic politics.</p>
<p>Second, in terms of the international situation, the increasingly unfavorable situation for Japan has become increasingly evident, which is also enough to make Konoe's "double reed policy," which he has always played with the Japanese warlords, go unheeded in the future. Recently, the large loans from Britain and the United States to China, as well as the economic sanctions against Japan advocated by various countries, all clearly indicate that Japan has caused a very deep reaction in the international community. Moreover, yesterday's new note from the United States to Japan does not recognize Konoe's so-called "new situation" and "new order." This kind of diplomatic pressure is becoming more and more obvious every day, which is naturally enough for the Konoe Cabinet to feel unable to sustain itself and open up a new situation in diplomacy. As far as China is concerned, Konoe's forte is to collude with the wavering elements in China, using "peace" as a cover, as a sugar-coated poison, in an attempt to subdue China without a fight. Unfortunately, Wang Jingwei's call for a peace declaration did not have the "unexpected effect" claimed in the Bai Ling Machine advertisement. On the contrary, the elimination of these wavering elements has further strengthened China's strength in the war of resistance. This is not only a failure of Wang Jingwei's conspiracy, but also a failure of Konoe's political conspiracy. Konoe's performance in international diplomacy is like this. If he does not resign, how can he develop a new situation for Japanese fascism?</p>
<p>In the opinion of the Japanese army and navy, since a weak cabinet like Konoe's cannot cope with the needs of wartime, they naturally hope that a more powerful centralized government can be established in the future, so that the Japanese warlords can do whatever they want. Therefore, the successor cabinet will be doomed to the same fate if it is not a tool of the warlords. However, despite catering to the wishes of the military and disregarding the lifeline of Japan's finances and economy, the tragic fate of Japan's finances and economy will surely come without delay. This can be seen from the recent closures of Japanese enterprises and the increase in unemployed workers, which have already revealed signs. No wonder the news of the resignation of the Japanese cabinet has just been released, and the prices of various stocks on the Japanese stock exchange have fallen sharply. The pessimistic feeling about the future of the war is fully revealed here. The changes in the Japanese political situation are like this, which can greatly increase China's infinite courage in the war of resistance, because everyone can know that even the peace dreams of the Konoe type have also fallen with Konoe's demise. The rise of Japanese fascist arrogance is bound to intensify the attack on China in order to make a final gamble. As long as China perseveres in its resistance, the final victory will be closer and closer!</p>
<h3>Voices from the Highest Academic Institution in England: Oxford University Deans and Professors Send Telegram, Respect Chiang Kai-shek and His Wife, Believe Leadership in the National Resistance Will Accomplish Great Undertakings, The Difference Between Chinese Civilization and Japanese Barbarism is Vast</h3>
<p>(London) Several deans and professors from various colleges of Oxford University recently jointly telegraphed General Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission of China, saying, "Your Excellency leads your nation's heroic resistance against aggression by those who invade your country and are enemies of your freedom. The deans and professors of our colleges express their utmost respect. Your Excellency and the people of your country are enduring hardships and striving hard, thus accomplishing extraordinary achievements, which are enough to be recorded in history and will not be forgotten by humankind for a long time. In the past, our nation was ignorant and had doubts about the true meaning of Chinese civilization and culture. Today, witnessing the barbaric hatred and narrow-minded nationalism of the Japanese side, which China still treats with a respectful attitude and self-restraint, there is no doubt as to which side represents civilization. Previously, when Your Excellency decided to abandon the city of Hankou, millions of civilians abandoned their homes and followed the resistance army westward. Your Excellency, as the leader of the nation, approved of this. Such a tragic act is something that other countries would not dare to do. Upon hearing this, we were shocked, but considering our traditional spirit and the events experienced by Nanjing and hundreds of other cities in your country, there was no other way to go. We believe that all democratic countries will one day be able to assist your country with a firm and unyielding attitude. The heroic spirit of your nation, even in the enemy country, cannot but elicit admiration in accordance with traditional spirit. Once that day arrives, Your Excellency will surely lead a unified country and prove that your nation is rich in talent and resilience. Even the sincerity of the British nation can be clearly demonstrated. We now express our respect to Your Excellency and Madame Chiang, who share joys and sorrows with you," (Havas News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<p>Oxford: Several deans and professors of Oxford University sent a letter to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and his wife, Madame Soong Mei-ling, who share his hardships, and to the Chinese people, expressing admiration and sympathy. The letter stated, "The Chinese people are now bravely resisting aggression, and Your Excellency is personally leading the fight against those who are trampling on their freedom. We deeply admire this. Your Excellency and the people are able to strengthen themselves unceasingly and, with a spirit of courage and perseverance, build achievements that are incredible. This is a great undertaking worthy of being recorded in history and never forgotten by mankind. We, on the one hand, are taught by the barbaric evil intentions held by those who worship petty nationalism, and on the other hand, are influenced by the noble self-restraint shown by the spirit of the Chinese people resisting Japan. There is no doubt in whose hands the torch of civilization is held." It continued, "We hope that one day in the future, the democrats of the world will stand firmly on your side, and the courage of your people will even win due recognition from the enemy, which they will be forced to give in accordance with their own traditional customs. If that day comes, then Your Excellency will be the leader of a united nation and will be able to prove the innate vitality of your people. Moreover, it will prove the sincerity of the British people, which is what we deeply hope for." The letter was signed by the deans of various colleges of Oxford University and professors of international law, Greek, German philosophy, modern history, economics, moral theology, American history, Chinese philosophy and religion. There are also some important officials who are currently not at the school, but would undoubtedly have signed if they were at the school. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<h3>Canada and the Philippines Forbid the Shipment of Military Supplies to Japan, The Situation in the British Far East Becomes More Uneasy, Considering Strong Measures to Deal with Japan</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Tokyo Dispatch: The Director of the East Asia Information Bureau of Japan and Inada of the Army General Staff Headquarters received information that the governments of the Philippines and Canada suddenly secretly ordered various munitions factories to stop selling munitions to Japan from now on. Starting in 1939, all Japanese orders will be rejected, and Japanese munitions purchasing agents will be notified that the government's move is actually the result of persuasion by prominent figures in both the United Kingdom and the United States, along with people in the Philippines, to the government. (3rd)</p>
<p>(London) The news that Japan plans to implement a three-year plan to create a new situation in the Far East has caused extreme anxiety among people in London. Banking and exporting circles are determined to put pressure on Prime Minister Chamberlain to wake up quickly, lest it be too late. Leland, a prominent figure in British business, published a letter in this morning's London Times, strongly stating that China is a good market for the United Kingdom, with the greatest potential for development, and that the United Kingdom must not allow Japan to leave it for its own use. The United Kingdom has invested no less than 300 million pounds in China, which is more than the total investment of all other countries (including Japan). In the past, British goods accounted for 12% of China's total imports, but in the first ten months of 1938, they only accounted for 8%. The author also cited Taiwan and Korea as examples. Since the above two places were annexed by the Japanese Empire, British trade has fallen to 1%. The trade situation in "Manchukuo" has also evolved similarly. If Japan can realize its plan in the future, it will not only monopolize the trade in the five provinces of North China, but even the trade in Central China. The Daily Telegraph takes the same attitude. The Sino-Japanese-Manchu Group's damage to the interests of Western powers has reached a degree that the powers cannot tolerate. Even German stores have been unable to gain a foothold in Manchuria, and American and British gasoline companies have been hit even harder since "Manchukuo" implemented oil controls. An examination of the current situation of British investment shows that China has the largest amount of foreign investment after Argentina. Therefore, the United Kingdom's economic interests in China are even greater than those of the United States. As for Japan, if the East Asian Economic Group achieves its wishes, it can obtain raw materials from China at will, and the benefits are self-evident. (Haitong, 4th)</p>
<p>(London) The Yorkshire Post (known as the organ of former Foreign Secretary Eden) recently reported that the British Cabinet ministers will discuss countermeasures to the policies implemented by Japan in China before the parliament reconvenes on the 31st of this month. At that time, they may adopt a tougher attitude to deal with Japan's discrimination against British trade. All actions taken by the British side will be in line with the attitude of the United States. (Havas, 4th)</p>

<h3>Chinese Troops Counterattack Southwest of Sanshui, Heavy Casualties Among Japanese Troops at Taiping Market</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) In recent days, both the Cantonese and Japanese sides have had little activity due to Wang Jingwei's departure and hopes of promoting peace.

Until the afternoon of the 4th, the Japanese army's offensive weakened due to heavy losses. After dusk, the battle situation calmed down slightly. On the 4th, the Japanese army in Qiujin continuously used fierce artillery fire to bombard the Chinese army's south bank of Zhanggongdu, Tonganling, and the highway area, firing more than 800 rounds, seemingly to cover the attacking units of the Japanese army on the north bank of Zhanggongdu. At the time of dispatch, clear artillery fire could still be heard. (4th)</p>

<h3>U.S. Navy Department Submits Document to Congress: Establishment of Thirty Military Bases; Existing Bases on the Philippine Islands to be Maintained; President Roosevelt Proposes Revision of Neutrality Law</h3>
<p>(Washington) The Navy Department recently submitted a memorandum to the 76th Congress requesting the immediate construction of thirty aviation bases and submarine destroyer/mine-laying ship bases on various U.S. possessions.  Admiral Hepburn, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, also submitted a report to Congress advocating the establishment of an impregnable naval base on Guam in the Pacific (the Washington Treaty of 1922 stipulated that Guam could not be fortified).  The island is the closest U.S. territory to Japan.  When the U.S. Navy withdraws from the Philippine Islands in the future, Guam should become the forward-most U.S. naval base in the Pacific. Its scale should be as large as possible to accommodate a large portion of the U.S. fleet and facilitate the defense of the Hawaiian Islands and the U.S. Pacific coast. In addition, Admiral Hepburn proposed strengthening defenses along the Atlantic coast, the Pacific coast, and the central Pacific.  The main points are as follows: (1) The aviation base at Hampton Roads, Virginia, on the Atlantic coast should be strengthened, and aviation bases should be added at Narragansett Bay, New England; the southeastern coast of Florida; Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; San Juan, Puerto Rico; and St. Thomas, Virgin Islands. (2) The base at San Diego on the Pacific coast should be strengthened, and the base at Alameda Bay should be maintained. At the same time, essential bases should be added at three locations on the Alaskan Peninsula: Sitka Island, and Kodiak Island. (3) The base at Pearl Harbor in the Hawaiian Islands in the central Pacific should be strengthened, while existing bases in the Philippine Islands should be maintained within the limits of not hindering current U.S. foreign policy. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Washington) After the opening of the 76th U.S. Congress today, President Roosevelt is reportedly scheduled to submit a message on the 4th of this month, stating that the Neutrality Law in its current form is unfair, and under certain circumstances, it facilitates aggressor nations and must be thoroughly revised. In addition, the President will submit the 1939-40 budget to Congress on the 5th of this month, and a message on national defense within the next week. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt, while speaking today with Acting Secretary of State Welles and Justice Department officials, is reported to have raised for discussion the question of how to penalize American merchants who violate the Neutrality Law by privately smuggling arms for export. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Washington) The 76th U.S. Congress convened today, and conservatives from both the Republican and Democratic parties will likely unite to oppose President Roosevelt's New Deal. After the adjournment of the 75th Congress, the government's attitude toward totalitarian countries hardened. It is unknown whether Congress agrees with this government policy.  Asking Congress to vote to approve vast national defense expenditures is likely to encounter considerable backlash. President Roosevelt's message to Congress is ready and he is expected to personally deliver it to Congress tomorrow, but he will present the construction of national defense to Congress within the next week.  Although the amount of funding the President proposes for the Army and Navy is still unknown, it is estimated to be between $1,300,000,000 and $1,500,000,000; only with this amount can 12,000 military aircraft and two 45,000-ton battleships be built, and the personnel and equipment of the Army and Air Force be enhanced. Although the preliminary meeting of Congress today seemed harmonious on the surface, signs of political warfare are evident everywhere, as many of the proposals registered by the important committees of the two houses are highly contentious. Conservative Democrats are now mostly gathered around Vice President Garner, whose prestige has greatly increased in the last two months. The intention of conservative Democrats is to revise President Roosevelt's New Deal in the next two years and to nominate a conservative figure as a presidential candidate at the 1940 Democratic National Convention. As for the President's position in Congress, it has been greatly strengthened as many strong supporters of the New Deal have been elected, such as Senator Barkley, who has been elected Senate Majority Leader, and Congressman Bankhead, who has been re-elected Speaker of the House. (AP, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Washington) The 76th U.S. Congress opened at noon today.  The chambers of both the Senate and the House were crowded.  New and returning members were introduced to each other. The thirty-five newly elected senators were immediately sworn in before the President of the Senate, Vice President Garner. The representatives must wait until Speaker of the House Bankhead is elected for reelection before they can be sworn in.  Today Congress only held the opening ceremony; apart from the routine announcement of the opening of the session, no resolutions were discussed.  The atmosphere in the chamber was extremely harmonious, but it is widely understood among most members that heated debates will inevitably arise when the Neutrality Law, national defense, and unemployment relief issues are discussed in the future. The party distribution in the 76th Congress is as follows: Senate: 69 Democrats, 23 Republicans, 1 Progressive, 1 Independent, and 2 Farmer-Labor; House of Representatives: 261 Democrats, 169 Republicans, 2 Progressives, 1 Farmer-Labor, and 1 American Labor. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Washington) The 76th U.S. Congress convened yesterday, with national defense and public relief being the two most pressing issues. It is generally expected that President Roosevelt and Vice President Garner will compete for control of the Democratic Party, in what most newspapers openly declare is a "struggle for supremacy." Garner represents the conservative wing of the Democratic Party and intends to revise parts of the New Deal, generally reorganize its procedures, and limit its continued implementation. President Roosevelt, on the other hand, will strive to maintain his freedom within the party and ensure the nomination of a progressive candidate for president in 1940. It is said that Roosevelt is handling the relief issue quite swiftly, simply notifying Congress that if it does not vote to approve funding for the Works Progress Administration, 3 million people will be unemployed by February 7. Currently, Republicans and conservative Democrats are advocating for cuts to relief spending and the return of administrative power to the states to prevent unemployment from being politically manipulated. However, government officials say they believe that opposition politicians will act cautiously and vote to approve the necessary funds when faced with the responsibility of deciding whether to continue or interrupt the funds upon which millions of people depend for their livelihoods. It is anticipated that President Roosevelt's message to Congress today will use strong language to reiterate his opposition to the advancement of authoritarianism and urge the United States to declare its leadership of the democratic front in the Americas, even if it means maintaining it on a larger scale. Bankhead was re-elected Speaker yesterday by a vote of 250 to 167. Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, predicted yesterday that this Congress will undertake a complete review of legislation that could affect U.S. relations with other countries. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<h3>Pittman's Speech: A Prelude to a Hardline Policy: The U.S. Will Take All Possible Measures to Deal with Treaty Violations and Aggression by Various Countries</h3>
<p>(Washington) Following Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, issuing a statement the other day advocating the prohibition of Japanese goods being imported into the United States and the transportation of American goods to Japan, well-informed sources here recently declared that the U.S. government has practically decided to use every means short of war, including breaking off diplomatic relations, to resist any country that violates existing treaties, engages in military aggression, or incites unrest in other countries in the hope of changing the current international situation. This opinion was expressed by Pittman. In addition, Pittman said that even if Japan were to declare war on the United States in the future, it would not have a major impact on the United States. This statement also applies to Germany. Some say that if the United States takes overly harsh measures against totalitarian countries, it may provoke war. However, judging from Pittman's statement, it can be seen that members of the U.S. government are prepared to refute this argument and will continue to propagate the idea that the American people are clear about the strength of the United States and its geographical advantages, and in reality, there is no need to worry about any war crisis. The responsibility of the United States is to maintain the fundamental principles of democracy and the international order with the greatest perseverance. It seems that President Roosevelt has decided to continue to psychologically mobilize the entire nation to resist totalitarian countries. Public opinion largely supports this move by the President. In the case of the Sino-Japanese conflict, American public opinion generally supports providing loans to China. Regarding the Spanish issue, American sympathy for the Nationalist government is decreasing day by day. Even American Catholics, who previously supported the Nationalists, are now divided in their opinions. Conversely, there is a growing number of people advocating providing food to the Republican government of Spain and even lifting the arms embargo on the Republican government. Not only that, but one of the key points of the U.S. naval expansion plan is to strengthen the defenses of Guam in the Pacific, which shows the government's intention to ensure that both the continental U.S. and its distant territories are prepared for any eventuality. Once Pittman's proposed measures are implemented, even if Japan attacks the United States, it will be able to resist. As for how Congress will react to this firm policy, it is currently difficult to say. Although the number of isolationists is not very large, they still retain considerable influence. There may be debates when Congress discusses the amendment of the Neutrality Law in the future, because the amendment of the Neutrality Law is truly a touchstone of whether the United States can implement a new foreign policy.

After the inspection, the Prime Minister drove to the French Club to attend a reception. Godia, Vice President of the Tunisian Consultative Council and French member, gave a speech saying that the French in Tunisia were unanimously determined to firmly reject unreasonable demands from foreign countries. Chenik, the leader of the Tunisian members, followed with a speech stating that the Tunisian natives were entirely loyal to France and that there were similarities between France's democratic ideals and the Muslims' ideals of freedom and equality. He expressed outrage at certain demands that sought to treat them with outdated colonial attitudes. (Havas, 3rd)</p>

(AP, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Rome) After returning to his post, U.S. Ambassador Phillips met with Prime Minister Mussolini today and held discussions. Although responsible officials here are keeping the details absolutely secret, well-informed sources know that the two sides discussed the attacks on the United States and President Roosevelt by Italian newspapers recently, especially during the 8th Pan-American Conference. Observers here say that the evolution of U.S.-Italian relations is the same as that of U.S.-German relations, in a word, deteriorating. (Havas, 3rd)</p>

<h3>Germany and Italy Plan to Win Over Yugoslavia: The Leaders of the Three Countries Will Meet</h3>
<p>Budapest, Hungary Yugoslav Prime Minister Stojadinović, German Aviation Minister General Göring, and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano are all scheduled to meet with Hungarian officials for a hunt in Ballina on the 19th of this month. This event is highly valued by the general public, who say that Yugoslavia's attitude towards the Berlin-Rome axis will be discussed at that time. Political figures here also commented that this may be the starting point for a reorganization of politics and economy in Southeastern Europe. The results of talks among the leaders of the respective countries will definitely have an impact on relations between Romania and Yugoslavia. The intention of Germany and Italy is to prompt Yugoslavia to distance itself from Romania, withdraw from the Balkan Entente, and even support Germany and Italy in the Balkan Peninsula. In short, the goal of Foreign Minister Ciano and General Göring is to win over Yugoslavia so that it adopts benevolent neutrality toward the German-Italian Axis or cooperates with it in good faith.

<h3>Mussolini's Rural Life</h3>
<p>Milan Prime Minister Mussolini is currently living in a villa in the countryside of Caminate. Since the heavy snow in Romagna has not stopped for days, Mussolini took his youngest son, Romano, to go skiing. Although Mussolini lives in the countryside, he still receives officials from Rome and handles official business as usual every day. He gets up very early, exercises, and then goes for a walk in various villages, often talking to farmers and workers tirelessly. The general rural population admires him and calls him a "very big child." (Haitong, 4th)</p>

<h3>The Experiences of the Red Army Led by Xiang Ying Participating in the War of Resistance Against Japan (Continued): Most of the New Fourth Army Operates on Both Sides of the Yangtze River; Has Now Recaptured Tongcheng, Shucheng, and Chaoxian</h3>
<p>The base of the New Fourth Route Army is in Anhui, and most of its operations are on both sides of the Yangtze River in that province. A part of the army is active in Jurong and Jintan in the Nanjing area. The main base of Anhui supplies it with munitions. The New Fourth Route Army is not like the Eighth Route Army, without its own government. It is commanded by the Third War Area Headquarters and supplied with munitions. Its area of activity is roughly semi-circular, extending from the Nanjing area to 200 miles to the east and as far as Lu'an to the west. Its supply base is within 80 miles on both sides of the Yangtze River. Four-tenths of the army's forces are on the north bank, which is more suitable for guerrilla warfare because there are many steep mountains and forests, making it easy to retreat and to ambush. There are also many large villages, with ample food supply, and mass mobilization is more widespread. Therefore, when Japanese trucks enter the area, villagers prepare to help attack. According to the army, last summer they overturned and destroyed as many as 60 Japanese trucks. In the New Fourth Route Army's area of operations on the north bank of the Yangtze River, there are two highways that the Japanese used to attack Hankou last summer. The mountain range is between the two routes, so the area is also suitable for guerrilla warfare. According to the New Fourth Route Army, the highway from Hefei to Hanshan is now impassable, and the highway from Hefei to the south is often damaged. When the Japanese army advanced along the Hefei-Huangmei highway last year, even though the New Fourth Route Army was not yet fully organized, it fully utilized the terrain to cut off the Japanese rear supply lines, destroy highways, and destroy bridges. At that time, the Japanese army had no spare strength and no intention of fighting guerrillas in the rear, so their advance was delayed. According to the army, when the Japanese army attacked Wuhan, they destroyed 150 Japanese trucks on the highway to Huangmei. Today, the New Fourth Route Army has recaptured Tongcheng, Shucheng, and Chaoxian. So far, the main Japanese bases on the north bank are Hanshan and Anqing. The south bank is not as suitable for guerrilla warfare as the north bank, because there are many plains, rivers and streams crisscross, the Japanese can use small motorboats, the river surface is eight feet higher than the ground, the levees are easy to breach, causing floods, and there are few forests near the mountains along the river. Because the New Fourth Route Army puts the people first, they not only do not breach the levees to trap the Japanese army, but also prevent the Japanese army from doing so to the best of their ability. As in other guerrilla areas, the Japanese army in the area only occupies the main transportation lines and large cities, while most of the area is still under Chinese control. It is claimed that, except for Jiangning County south of Nanjing, all other counties have government-appointed county magistrates. So far, the Japanese army in the area does not dare to advance, but instead concentrates its forces to protect the transportation lines. The terrain behind the New Fourth Route Army's operations on the south bank gradually rises, eventually reaching the Yellow Mountains, which are 1,400 meters above sea level. The area has beautiful scenery, a mild climate, and rice, wheat, and tea as its main products. Since the terrain is suitable for guerrilla warfare and the products are abundant, the New Fourth Route Army in the area can be expected to make a new record in its history.</p>
<h3>Rugao: River Bandits Rampant; Passengers of the Ruihe Robbed; Losses Exceed 70,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Rugao Correspondence: Rugao is adjacent to the river and the sea, with an extremely long coastline. Since its fall, the riverbanks have been frequently shelled by Japanese warships, making it impossible for guerrillas to deploy defenses. However, land routes are strictly inspected, so banditry on the shore is rare. But in the river, bandits appear and disappear at will, day and night. At the end of last month, two rowing boats leaving the county were consecutively robbed by bandits, carrying pigs worth more than 5,000 yuan, which have not yet been returned. On the morning of the 31st, the Ruihe ship sailed from Shanghai to Changyinsha, with about 30 Rugao passengers on board, some coming to Shanghai to sell goods, others to settle accounts before the New Year. After disembarking, they transferred to iron barges, which were towed by small steamers to various ports in Rugao. That day, due to a missed schedule and strong winds, the passengers could not bear the cold. Coincidentally, a rowing boat approached the iron barge, and they all eagerly disembarked. The boat sailed west with its sails up, heading towards Dongjie Port, when suddenly it dropped anchor, demanding rowing fees. After a long while, it proceeded west again. At this time, another boat had already raced ahead to the west from Dongjie Port. As the rowing boat approached that boat, seven or eight bandits jumped into the rowing boat, brandishing guns and shouting threats, driving the passengers into the bandit boat and carrying away their goods. After searching each passenger and confiscating their money and belongings, they drove them back into the rowing boat. Before leaving, they pointed their guns at the passengers and shouted loudly, "We are from Xinshenggang (Japanese-occupied territory)!" They then pointed at the boatman and said, "This boatman is not a good person and should be shot immediately!" Then they roared away. The passengers were all deathly pale. Among them, a cotton merchant named Mr. Li had 17,000 yuan confiscated, which was hidden in an orange basket, the entire basket being taken away. A ham merchant had 15,000 yuan confiscated. The total loss for the entire boat was more than 70,000 yuan. The passengers were distraught, weeping, and almost wanted to throw themselves into the river. After the bandit boat left, the rowing boat raised its sails and headed north. When it approached Xiaoligang (Tongjing), another bandit boat suddenly appeared, shining a searchlight. The passengers, like startled birds, quickly docked at the Xiaoligang beach and fled through the sand. As they came ashore, the rowing boat was deemed suspicious, so they reported it to the troops stationed at the port, who apprehended and interrogated them. According to their confession, they admitted to being accomplices in the robbery. The chief of the Qiao detachment, considering the boat's involvement in the robbery of passengers to be extremely unlawful, ordered them to be shot as a warning. Now, all passengers traveling to and from the area are filled with fear and vigilance due to the rampant banditry, lamenting the difficulty of travel.</p>
<h3>The Jiangnan People's Self-Defense Corps Actively Deploys to Recover Lost Territory, Mobilizing the Military and Civilians for Cooperation, and Elucidating the Meaning of Warfare</h3>
<p>Zhenjiang Correspondence: Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, civilian armed forces have also been extensively developed. The "Never Be Slaves People's Self-Defense Corps" is also active. The Jiangnan United Corps Command of the corps is currently actively deploying to recover lost territory, and it is heard that their first goal is to recover Guangde, Changxing, and Yixing, as capturing these three places would allow them to control Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces. The Command is also mobilizing the military and civilians for cooperation, promoting both broad and narrow senses of warfare, and has issued various propaganda materials to ensure that the people thoroughly understand. Excerpts from the propaganda materials are as follows: (I) The Name of War: If the name is not correct, words are not smooth; if words are not smooth, things cannot be accomplished. Therefore, a gentleman must be able to speak, and what he says must be practicable. This is why Confucius told Zilu that if he had to correct something, he would start with the name when Wei Zhe seized the country and resisted his father. Applying this principle, no matter what, correcting the name is the most important and the first thing to do, especially in a war that concerns the nation's honor. Tang exiled Jie, and Wu attacked Zhou to save the people. Emperor Gao of Han rose in revolt to drive out the tyrannical Qin. Zhuge Liang attacked Wei to restore the Han Dynasty. Li Yuan replaced the Sui Dynasty, following the will of Heaven and the people. Emperor Taizu of Ming transferred the mandate of the Yuan Dynasty, and Sun Yat-sen overthrew the Qing Dynasty, embodying nationalism. Washington broke away from Britain to seek independence, unable to endure British oppression. The North and South American Civil War lasted for decades because Lincoln wanted to liberate black slaves. All of these were justified, and they were able to seize the initiative with their righteous cause. What about the Japanese invaders? They seized our Northeast Provinces on September 18th, disturbed our Shanghai on January 28th, launched a surprise attack on Lugouqiao on July 7th, and then massively invaded Shanghai on August 13th. All of these were unprovoked attacks. The reason they didn't declare war is that their cause is unjust. Now, try to ask anyone for a legitimate reason for their war, and I dare say that no one can provide an answer on their behalf. However, our country is different. The Japanese invaders' rape and slaughter of our people are meant to insult our national dignity. We use war to preserve it. The Japanese invaders' threats and enticements of our people are meant to undermine our national dignity. We use war to protect it. The Japanese invaders' enslavement policies toward our people are meant to destroy our national dignity. We use war to build a strong guarantee of our national dignity, so that the two words "national dignity" will shine for all eternity, as bright as the sun and stars, lasting as long as heaven and earth. With a correct name and smooth words, how can the cunning and cruel Japanese invaders succeed?</p>
<p>(II) Broad and Narrow Warfare: As the saying goes, "A military can be unused for a hundred years, but it cannot be unprepared for a single day." Being prepared means not forgetting war. Not forgetting war requires preparing for war, and then we can talk about war. However, preparation can be tangible or intangible, and war can be tangible or intangible. Tangible preparation is how we prepare against others, while intangible preparation can make others relax their guard and forget about preparing against us. Tangible warfare cannot guarantee victory even with fierce fighting, while intangible warfare can subdue others without fighting. This is the distinction between broad and narrow senses of warfare. What is the narrow sense? It is tangible preparation and tangible warfare. What is the broad sense? It is intangible preparation and intangible warfare.</p>
<p>King Zhao Ling of Zhao changed to Hu clothing and learned horsemanship and archery, so the Xiongnu dared not spy on Zhao's borders. This is preparation that belongs to the tangible. Goujian spent ten years accumulating resources and ten years training his people, eventually defeating Wu. This is preparation that belongs to the intangible. Zhou Yu defeated Cao Cao at the Red Cliffs, and Xie An defeated Fu Jian at the Fei River. This is warfare that belongs to the tangible. Tao Kan practiced labor by moving bricks, and Liu Kun danced with the crowing of the rooster. Although these are not related to warfare, the spirit of warfare is revealed in the intangible. Moreover, since ancient times in our country, peasants have also practiced archery and horsemanship. The feudal lords did not abandon hunting in the meadows, which is the same as Westerners holding horse races, boat races, and ball games, all to promote a martial spirit and prepare for the selection of future defenders of the country. We should not wait until the war has already begun before starting training. Alas, the broad sense of warfare is indeed more necessary than the narrow sense of warfare. The Japanese invaders are relying on the full force of their sea, land, and air power to invade our country. This clearly belongs to the scope of narrow warfare, but they do not know that they devoted themselves to the broad sense of warfare decades ago before daring to launch a large-scale invasion against our country. Economic aggression, cultural aggression, and the establishment of special agent organizations throughout the provinces of North China all started with the four words "broad warfare." Alas, how terrifying! Therefore, our country must mobilize the entire nation to engage in a universal movement of broad warfare in order to contend with the Japanese invaders. Gandhi spun yarn, wove cloth, dried salt, and even fasted in order to achieve India's independence. Piłsudski restored Poland by teaching piano. These are all excellent models of broad warfare, which our people should urgently emulate. If we can learn their spirit and train the entire nation into soldiers, even if the Japanese invaders are strong, it will not be difficult to devise a plan to annihilate them in jest. Alas, how can we have a home if the Xiongnu are not destroyed? This life-and-death moment is only for the final struggle. May our people not neglect it!</p>
<p>(III) The Meaning of Broad Warfare: The meaning of broad warfare has been outlined in the previous "Broad and Narrow Warfare," but the importance of engaging in broad warfare is actually ten times or a hundred times greater than that of narrow warfare. Therefore, I will supplement it as follows. The meaning and importance of broad warfare, the theories of which are scattered throughout the classics and commentaries, are most detailed in the Book of Mencius. Mencius said to King Hui of Liang, "If Your Majesty implements benevolent governance for the people, reduces punishments and taxes, encourages deep plowing and weeding, and allows the strong to use their leisure time to cultivate filial piety, brotherly respect, loyalty, and trustworthiness, entering to serve their fathers and elder brothers, and going out to serve their superiors, you can enable them to use sticks to beat Qin and Chu's strong armor and sharp weapons." He also said, "To secure the people, do not rely on the boundaries of the territory; to fortify the country, do not rely on the dangers of mountains and streams; to awe the world, do not rely on the benefits of weapons and armor. Those who gain the Dao have much help; those who lose the Dao have little help. To the extreme of having little help, even relatives will betray them. To the extreme of having much help, the world will submit to them. Using what the world submits to attack those whom relatives betray, therefore, a gentleman may not fight, but if he fights, he will surely win." Although Mencius did not explicitly define the term "broad warfare," his theory has exhaustively elucidated the meaning and importance of the four words "broad warfare." Mencius argued that to achieve military victory, one must first focus on the people's army. What is the people's army? It is education and politics. Seeking victory in military affairs is like digging a well when thirsty, while starting with education and politics is like preparing mugwort beforehand when treating a disease. Looking back over the millennia and across the nine continents, none can escape the scope of Mencius's theory. Yue's defeat of Wu and Germany's victory over France were both based on education and politics. The current large-scale invasion by the Japanese also stems from their decades of diligent governance throughout the country before daring to recklessly attempt it. Airplanes and cannons are merely the tools of their narrow warfare. Duke Huan of Qi united the feudal lords nine times without using military chariots, and Duke Wen of Jin showed good faith when attacking Yuan and demonstrated ritual during a grand hunting, achieving hegemony after one battle. All of these were preparations made before war, and that is how they achieved such results. However, I believe that even when two countries face each other in battle, one cannot rely solely on strong armor and sharp weapons to defeat a powerful enemy. Zhizhiwu originally declined to serve as a war minister but ultimately relied on persuasion to repel the tyrannical Qin. Zheng Xuangao, as a merchant, feigned a welcome to the troops and relieved the national crisis. Similarly, Sun Bin used deception to avenge himself, Zhuge Liang used the Empty City Stratagem to repel the enemy, Zhang Zifang replaced flags, and Tan Daokai sang while measuring sand. As the saying goes, "Application lies in the heart," and it is up to the commander to be divine and enlightened. Furthermore, to gain the hearts of the military, one must first gain the hearts of the people. If one gains the hearts of the people and uses them well, one can achieve the effect of the entire nation being soldiers. If one does not use them well, one will immediately face the danger of being in the same boat with the enemy. The people are like water, which can carry a boat or overturn it. The common people can be deceived but cannot be truly deceived. Here, I will discuss the importance of broad warfare in detail and briefly add my own opinions.</p>
<h3>After the Fall of Guangzhou: Observations Along the Guangdong-Guangxi Route (I): Refugees Overcrowded, Many Dead and Injured; All Counties and Towns Bombed</h3>
<p>Wuzhou Correspondence: When Guangzhou was unfortunately lost under the defense of Yu Hanmou, Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth Route Army, on October 21st, as the lifeblood of Guangzhou was hanging by a thread, your correspondent decided to leave the city, cross the river from Huangsha to escape danger, and walk westwards by land. Passing through Shunde, Panyu, Nanhai, Sanshui, Gaoming, and Gaoyao, I then went up the West River into Guangxi. Along the way, either due to vehicle congestion or temporarily staying in various market towns and villages, I inquired about the situation in various places. Therefore, it took me more than twenty days to reach the border of Guangxi. I will now record the observations and situations along the way as follows:</p>
<p>Guangzhou unfortunately fell on October 21st, under the defense of Yu Hanmou, Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth Route Army. That night, as the lifeblood of Guangzhou was in imminent danger, your correspondent decided to leave the city, crossed the river from Huangsha to Fangcun. When I arrived at the Huangsha wharf, I saw crowds of citizens, young and old, carrying their belongings, packed together and vying to cross. The sounds of shouting and crying merged into one. Shops were also scrambling to move goods out of the city, either crossing to Shiwetang, going to Fangcun, or moving to Henan. Cars, trucks, and rickshaws filled the roads, leaving pedestrians with almost no room to turn around. In the midst of the clamor and congestion, an air raid alarm suddenly sounded, and all the lights in the city went out. The refugees were even more frightened and in a more desperate state. The elderly, weak, men, women, and children who were pushed into the water or suffocated to death along the coast were found everywhere. I hired a small sampan for five yuan and crossed from Huangsha to Fangcun. When I landed, it was already past 9:00 PM. Looking towards the Huangsha Railway Station on the north bank, I saw dark shadows moving about. A moment later, the sound of machine guns erupted near the station, as dense as firecrackers, lasting for a full twenty minutes before stopping. At that time, several locomotives were firing up in the station, waiting for orders. Large numbers of troops were gathered before and after the station, and military supplies and heavy weapons were piled up like mountains, presumably waiting to board the trains and retreat north along the Guangdong Railway. That night, the order in Guangzhou had already fallen into a state of chaos. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>A Brief History of the French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association</h3>
<p>— Shugan</p>
<p>The French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association was established in the spring of the 16th year of the Republic of China (1927). The motive for its organization was to oppose the increase in house taxes in the French Concession and to demand an increase in Chinese directors and the political participation of citizens. The stated purpose was to develop autonomy within the concession, seek public benefits, and advocate for equal treatment.</p>
<p>The presence of Chinese directors on the French Concession Municipal Council actually began with Article 4 of the agreement between China and France regarding the extraterritorial roads of the French Concession on April 8, 3rd year of the Republic of China (1914). At that time, the first Chinese directors were Wu Xin, the director of the Tongren Fuyuan Hall, and Lu Bohong, the general manager of the Huashang Electric Company. After taking office, they established a Chinese Directors Office near the Sanyangjing Bridge on Avenue Edward VII, with 300 taels of office expenses to be allocated monthly by the Jiangsu Finance Department. Later, due to the financial difficulties of Jiangsu Province, the aforementioned funding was suspended for a long time, and the office also ceased operations. In the 8th year of the Republic of China (1919), Wu's position became vacant, and the vacancy was filled by Lu Wennong, director of the Bao'an Hall. Lu's position became vacant in the 15th year of the Republic of China (1926), and was not filled. In the 16th year of the Republic of China, the taxpayers in the concession believed that the Municipal Council only had two Chinese directors, and they were all appointed by the French Consul General. Although the Chinese directors had fulfilled their due responsibilities, the number of seats was too few and lacked fairness. Therefore, they launched a movement to demand an increase in Chinese directors. At that time, the National Revolutionary Army arrived in Shanghai, and the international situation changed greatly. The French Concession authorities, taking into account the people's sentiment, automatically promulgated a new charter for the Municipal Council and increased the number of Chinese members to three. The first Chinese members were Zhu Yanzhi, Wu Zonglian, and Wei Tingrong. However, this did not shake the belief of the general taxpayers in demanding an increase. On the contrary, it inspired their awareness of organization, making them understand that only organized action could generate great power and achieve the desired goals. Therefore, they convened an inaugural meeting and publicly elected Huang Jinrong, Zhang Xiaolin, and Du Yuesheng as the preparatory directors of the French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association, and established a preparatory office at Eight Immortals Lane on Rue Wagner. Coincidentally, at that time (July of the 16th year), the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement planned to increase the house tax from 14% to 16%. The French Municipal Council followed suit and also prepared to increase the first and second house taxes to 14% (Note: The two concessions have always taken the same steps in collecting house taxes and other reforms. However, in the 10th year of the Republic of China, the authorities of the two concessions both planned to increase the house tax from 12% to 14%. After the Shanghai Commercial Federation of the French Concession sent a letter to politely discuss the matter, the French Consul General Mr. Fletchers reviewed the financial situation of the Municipal Council and then automatically waived the increase. This is the origin of the difference in house tax rates between the two concessions). The preparatory committee used the slogan of opposing the increase in house taxes to enhance its appeal. The reason given was that the Municipal Council's budget for that year had a very slight deficit, and there was no need to increase the house tax. After several resolutions opposing the increase, the French Municipal Council realized that it was not appropriate to increase the tax without the consent of the citizen groups. Therefore, they asked Du Yuesheng to mediate to avoid escalating the situation. After Du Yuesheng's repeated consultations, the two sides agreed to temporarily increase the tax for six months to make up for the Municipal Council's budget deficit for that year. After six months, the original rate of 12% would be resumed. Therefore, all the 14% house tax bills that had already been printed by the French Municipal Council in the autumn and winter of the 16th year were temporarily stamped with the words "Temporarily collected for six months" to serve as a marker. (Note: This case was renegotiated the following year, and the rate was reduced by one percent, which is the current 13% rate collected by the French Municipal Council.)</p>
<p>After the French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association resolved the case of opposing the tax increase, it established a temporary council. It was organized by twenty-seven temporary council members elected by representatives of various organizations. In January of the 18th year of the Republic of China, the first re-election was held. More than 800 voting citizens elected twenty-one citizen representatives and twenty-four organization representatives. The representatives held a general meeting and elected fifteen executive committee members, including Gong Jingyan, Xu Caicheng, Qu Zhenhua, and Dong Kechang, and four alternates, including Yuan Ludeng and Fang Jiaobo. The supervisory committee consisted of Huang Jinrong, Du Yuesheng, and Jin Tingsun, with Lu Tingjian and Xie Qianggong as alternates. Zhang Xiaolin was elected as the chairman of the committee.</p>
<p>In July of the 18th year of the Republic of China, Chinese directors Wu Zonglian and Zhang Xiaolin resigned successively. The general meeting of representatives elected Du Yuesheng and Zhang Xiaolin as Chinese directors to the French Municipal Council. As for the case of demanding an increase in Chinese directors, it was not until October 23rd of the 19th year of the Republic of China that the French Consul General responded, agreeing to establish five Chinese director seats and nine special committee members. On November 8th of the same year, the association convened a general meeting of representatives and elected Zhang Xiaolin, Du Yuesheng, Zhu Yanzhi, Wei Tingrong, and Lu Bohong as Chinese directors for 1930, and Zhang Jixian, Jin Tingsun, and Gong Jingyan as nine Chinese committee members. This was the beginning of Chinese directors being completely elected by the people.</p>
<p>In July of the 20th year of the Republic of China, the second re-election was held. The number of participating voters was greater than the first election. Most of the executive and supervisory committee members were re-elected, but Du Yuesheng was elected as the chairman of the committee.</p>
<p>In the 21st year of the Republic of China, Du Yuesheng resigned from his concurrent position as Chinese director to focus on association affairs, and his concurrent position was succeeded by Qi Yunqing.</p>
<p>In December of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, the third re-election was held. The number of participating voters was even greater. The number of executive and supervisory committee members was also increased. The executive committee members were Du Yuesheng, Gong Jingyan, Jin Liren, Qu Zhenhua, Mao Yun, Dong Kechang, Wang Deyan, etc., nineteen people, with Xue Fuji, Gu Wensheng, etc., seven people as alternates. The supervisory committee members were Huang Jinrong, Zhang Xiaolin, Jin Tingsun, Zhu Wenqi, Dai Chunfeng, etc., five people, with Shao Baoxing, Lu Tingjian, etc., three people as alternates. The first resolution meeting of the executive committee re-elected Du Yuesheng as chairman.</p>
<p>In December of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, Zhang Xiaolin, Lu Bohong, Zhu Yanzhi, Qi Yunqing, and Wu Kaisheng were re-elected as Chinese directors for 1934, and Zhang Xiaoxian, Jin Tingsun, Gong Jingyan, etc., nine people, were re-elected as Chinese committee members.</p>
<p>In December of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, Zhang Xiaolin, Lu Bohong, Zhu Yanzhi, Qi Yunqing, and Zhang Jixian were re-elected as Chinese directors for 1935.</p>
<p>In December of the 24th year of the Republic of China, the fourth re-election was held. More than 3,700 voters participated, electing citizen representatives such as Du Yuesheng, twenty-one people; organization representatives were elected by the Second Special District Citizens' Federation, etc., such as Qu Zhenhua, twenty-four people. A general meeting of representatives was held at the Zhonghui Building on December 25th, electing Du Yuesheng, Jin Tingsun, Dong Kechang, Mao Yun, Qu Zhenhua, etc., nineteen people as executive committee members, and Zhu Wende, Zhang Xiangyun, seven people as alternates. Huang Jinrong, Zhang Xiaolin, Zhu Wenqi, etc., five people as supervisory committee members, and Shao Binxing, etc., three people as alternates. Du Yuesheng was elected as chairman, and Jin Tingsun as vice-chairman. As for the 1936 Chinese directors, they were Zhang Xiaolin, Lu Bohong, Qian Xinzhi, Qi Yunqing, and Zhang Jixian. The Chinese committee members were Zu Xingrang, Zhang Fayao, Dong Kechang, etc., nine people. In 1937, the Chinese directors were not re-elected due to the war. This year (1938), due to the vacancy of Chinese director Lu Bohong, Zu Xingrang was elected to succeed him, and Zu's vacancy on the Chinese committee was filled by Gui Yanfang. Although there have been personnel changes in the executive committee, due to legal restrictions, it has not been re-elected to this day.</p>
<p>The above is a brief history of the French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association. The general situation of the organization and the work situation over the years are not within the scope of this article, so they will not be elaborated on.</p>
<h3>American Global Wireless Electric Company Has a National Government License; Japanese Protest Based on Two Key Points; The Company Believes Supervision Is Unnecessary</h3>
<p>According to the English Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury, the Japanese authorities lodged a protest with the American Consul General in Shanghai regarding the telegrams sent by a certain American wireless electric company. This matter was also mentioned at a press conference held by the Japanese side yesterday (3rd). It was learned that in the past few days, a certain American wireless electric company had sent telegrams from China without being inspected. At the press conference held at the Broadway Mansions last night, the Japanese side informed reporters that the Global Wireless Electric Company, operated by Americans at 51 Guangdong Road, had been sending commercial telegrams. The Japanese authorities had lodged a protest with the American Consul General in Shanghai. It is understood that the Japanese protest is based on two key points: first, the Global Wireless Electric Company's business license was obtained from Chongqing; second, the company sent telegrams "without the supervision of the Japanese authorities." This morning (4th), a person from Global Wireless Electric Company told reporters that the company engaged in such communication business with the permission of the National Government. Therefore, it has been working with the National Government for many years. It has obtained a license from the National Government to send commercial telegrams. According to international communication rules and regulations, only the National Government in China has the right to issue licenses. It also stated that Global Wireless Electric Company is an independent company opened and operated by Americans. According to the rules and regulations of the US Federal Communications Commission, it has obtained its proper license to engage in communication between the US and China. Therefore, Global Wireless Electric Company does not need to be "supervised." At the same time, it was learned that the protest lodged by the Japanese authorities with the American Consul General in Shanghai has been forwarded to Washington for consideration.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Opens; Rice Prices Stable; Transactions Increase; Supply from Inland Also Strong</h3>
<p>After the New Year holiday of three days, the rice market in this city reopened yesterday. Rice prices were stable, transactions between rice shops and customers increased sharply, and the supply of rice from inland areas was also strong. After Japanese merchants and the puppet organizations in various counties in the guerrilla areas monopolized food, they evaded taxes and exported it. There were 40,000 to 50,000 bags per week. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Market Opens; Rice Prices Stable</p>
<p>The Bean and Rice Market at 515 Fuzhou Road, closed on December 31st last year. Due to the New Year, it was also closed for three days as usual. Yesterday (4th), it reopened as usual. From 9:00 AM to 11:45 AM when the market closed, except for the slight increase in the price of thin rice and Ke Xian due to increased demand, the prices of early and late new japonica rice remained the same as at the end of last year. Therefore, the market sentiment was extremely stable.</p>
<p>Transactions Increase; Supply Also Strong</p>
<p>During the three-day New Year holiday, transactions between rice shops and customers stopped. The rice shops used the rice they had in stock to supply the citizens, and their inventory had been reduced. Therefore, after the market opened yesterday, transactions between rice shops and customers increased sharply, with a total transaction volume of 12,000 to 13,000 bags (all warehouse goods). The supply from inland areas was also quite strong. Because the customs office was closed during the holiday, the rice shipped to Shanghai since the end of last year was loaded on ships and began to be unloaded yesterday morning after the customs office opened.</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants Smuggle Large Amounts of Rice</p>
<p>Due to the economic depletion in Japan, heavy taxes, and the increased burden on the people, the Japanese are eager to seek our resources to make up for their losses. In the guerrilla areas within the reach of the Japanese military, Japanese merchants and puppet organizations actively monopolize food. They collect rice in the countryside as much as possible and depress the market price. The farmers are suffering greatly. Farmers in more economically prosperous rural areas store rice and are unwilling to mill it and sell it in order to resist. However, Japanese merchants use collaborators to purchase rice on their behalf everywhere. It is learned that 40,000 to 50,000 bags of rice are shipped from inland areas to Shanghai every week, smuggled out through Hongkou. That is, the rice owned by Chinese merchants is checked under the pretext of military affairs, and then carried away without paying a penny.</p>
<h3>Disposition Method for Smuggling Prohibited Goods for Export: Direct Assistance to the Enemy Verified, Life Imprisonment or Death Penalty</h3>
<p>To control the transportation and sale of goods, increase exports, and prevent aiding the enemy, the government, in cooperation with the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, has adjusted the export of goods in various regions. It is learned that the authorities, to prevent the smuggling of prohibited goods for export, have specifically instructed the provincial governments and customs bureaus to implement the following disposition methods if any are discovered: (1) For those transported from the date of the local competent authority's public announcement, the original owner shall be ordered to retrieve the goods and submit a pledge not to smuggle them again; (2) For those transported after the date of the announcement, in addition to confiscating the goods, a fine of up to one thousand yuan may be imposed; (3) If direct sale to the enemy is verified, a sentence of life imprisonment or death penalty shall be imposed; (4) The confiscation of goods and the imposition of fines shall be executed by the local competent authority after submission to and approval by the higher competent authority.</p>
<h3>Telegram Received Yesterday by People in Shanghai: Dinghai's Order Restored, Misunderstanding Between Guerrilla Force and Water Police, Not Pirates Landing, Public Peace of Mind</h3>
<p>On December 25th of last year, a guerrilla force of 317 people arrived in Dinghai from Chuansha, Jiangsu, on civilian boats. The county government, considering that the team had come from afar across the sea to preserve the country, treated them with utmost courtesy and selected a public place in the city as the team's garrison location. For five or six days, they lived in peace. Unexpectedly, on the 31st, a misunderstanding suddenly occurred with the original water police in Dinghai. The headquarters of the water police team stationed in Xidao was surrounded by the guerrilla force, and both sides exchanged gunfire with live ammunition, creating an</p>
<p>unusually tense</p>
<p>situation.</p>
<p>Upon hearing the news, the Zhenhai Overseas Water Police Bureau telegraphed Haimen and Shibu, dispatching three squadrons of water police, each with forty-eight men, totaling more than one hundred and forty men. On January 2nd of this year, they arrived in Dinghai on a certain ship. Because they could not dock at the pier, they returned to Zhushanmen. The guerrilla force rushed to that place and ordered two squadrons to surrender their weapons. One remaining squadron, seeing the unfavorable situation, immediately fled back to the original ship, which sailed to Haimen, disembarked the one squadron of water police, and then sailed to Ningbo. This is the factual account of what happened. Investigation reveals that the Dinghai</p>
<p>Water Police Headquarters</p>
<p>had a wireless telegraph, allowing them to communicate with the outside world. At this time, it was also controlled by the guerrilla force, making it impossible to send telegrams, resulting in confusion among fellow villagers in Shanghai regarding the truth, causing great alarm. Several days ago, a bandit gang of over one hundred people raided Linghe Township, causing significant losses to the residents. Because the township is very close to the city, there were rumors outside that bandits had occupied the county seat, which is indeed a minor certainty. Chen Yingxin, the magistrate of Dinghai County,</p>
<p>telegraphed his resignation</p>
<p>and it has already been approved. Lin Shize, a special commissioner of the county party headquarters recommended by Chen, has succeeded him, and the provincial authorities have also approved. Someone with a certain surname, unable to obtain the position of county magistrate, harbored resentment in his heart. Regarding this incident, some suspect that he incited it from within. These are just rumors, and we dare not believe them. Now, the order in the city and streets has been restored. The fellow villagers of Dinghai in Shanghai received reply telegrams yesterday, bringing great peace of mind.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Ningbo Joint Transportation: Haimen Promulgates Inspection Measures, Jinhua-Ningbo Opens Joint Transportation Service</h3>
<p>After Zhejiang East promulgated navigation measures and re-registered ships, Haimen promulgated measures for inspecting ships. Before direct Shanghai-Ningbo voyages are approved, Haimen will serve as the center for organizing joint transportation of passengers and goods. Jinhua-Ningbo will open joint transportation service starting from the 15th. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai-Ningbo Joint Transportation: Taizhou as the Center</p>
<p>The Meida vessel of the Portuguese company Melly &amp; Co., operating on the Taizhou-Shibu-Dinghai-Ningbo line, and the Haifu vessel of the German company Reiwa Yoko, operating on the Shanghai-Taizhou line, are jointly operating Shanghai-Ningbo transportation, with Taizhou (i.e., Haimen) as the center. The joint transportation of goods has already been implemented at the end of last month, and the joint transportation of passengers is currently under discussion. The American company Wah Mei &amp; Co. has now decided that the Tangsai vessel operating on the Taizhou-Shibu-Dinghai-Ningbo line and the Tangbei vessel operating on the Shanghai-Taizhou line will jointly operate transportation, also with Taizhou as the center, dividing into passenger and cargo services. Preparations are complete and it is expected to be implemented starting today. The Tangbei is scheduled to depart from Shanghai to Taizhou this morning. For passengers who purchase Shanghai-Ningbo joint tickets, the company will handle the loading and unloading of luggage free of charge. The loading and unloading of goods will also be handled in the same way.</p>
<p>Regarding the Shanghai-Ningbo Direct Voyage Issue</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of direct Shanghai-Ningbo voyages, according to news from the shipping industry yesterday, various fellow villagers' associations in Zhejiang East and shipping companies operating in Zhejiang East all hope that the authorities will approve it as soon as possible to facilitate travel and smooth cargo transportation. However, it has not yet been approved by the authorities. Whether it will be approved in the future is currently uncertain. However, the approval of direct voyages for cargo ships is more promising than for passenger ships. As for the temporary special permission for the Moufu vessel to sail from Shanghai to Wenzhou and then from Wenzhou to Ningbo to load goods, it is temporary and not permanent. That vessel is scheduled to depart from Shanghai for Wenzhou and then to Ningbo for the second time today. Now, before the authorities approve it, shipping merchants have decided to comply with the order to suspend direct Shanghai-Ningbo voyages.</p>
<p>Four Vessels Temporarily Stop at Wanding, Dinghai</p>
<p>The foreign vessels Shantai, Hana, Haifu, Tangbei, and Gaodeng, which operate on the Shanghai-Taizhou line and also call at Wanding and Dinghai, have been ordered to stop calling at Wanding and Dinghai, and now use Haimen or Shibu as their final destinations. The vessels are currently rushing to complete re-registration procedures. According to news from the shipping industry yesterday, the Tenth Army Group Commander has allowed the above vessels to call at Wanding and Dinghai again. After the approval document is delivered to the Ningbo City Defense Commander, they can resume operations. Currently, the foreign vessels operating in Dinghai are the Tianbao, Libao, and Tangsai and Meida on the Yongding line. A total of four vessels temporarily suspended operations due to the incident in Dinghai. They will resume operations after order in Dinghai is restored.</p>
<p>Haimen Formulates Inspection Measures</p>
<p>The Haimen Port Inspection Joint Implementation Measures: (1) These measures were jointly discussed and formulated by the Haimen Martial Law Inspection Office, Taizhou Goods Import and Export Inspection Office, Third District Anti-Smuggling Office, Cigarette Management Office, Consolidated Tax Inspection Office, Linhai Japanese Goods Inspection Team, and other agencies. (2) Before each ship enters or exits the port, the inspectors dispatched by each agency must gather in front of the Martial Law Inspection Office and go together for inspection. However, agencies unrelated to the duties may not send inspectors. (3) When inspectors implement inspections, they must bring the badges or armbands of their respective agencies or other inspection tools for identification. (4) After the inspectors arrive at the port, they will be divided into two groups, one group to board the ship to inspect people and goods, and one group to inspect luggage on the shore. Each group will implement inspections according to the inspection rules of their original agency. (5) After the boarding inspectors have completed their tasks, they must all disembark at the same time and must not loiter privately, except in cases of special circumstances. (6) If the inspectors find any contraband, tax-evading smuggled goods, or Japanese goods, they must detain the people and goods together, register them at the Martial Law Inspection Office, and then take them back to their respective competent agencies for handling according to the law. (7) These measures will be implemented from today. If there are any omissions, a joint meeting may be convened at any time to revise them.</p>
<p>Ningbo Jinhua Joint Transport Service</p>
<p>For the convenience of travel, the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Bureau is organizing direct transport service between Jinhua and Hengzhang (15 kilometers from Ningbo). Wu Yanqing, the acting manager of the Yin-Feng Long-Distance Bus Company, has reached an agreement with the province. The Provincial Highway Bureau and the Yin-Feng Bus Company will jointly operate the service. To ensure the energy of the drivers and the safety along the way, the direct transport service will be changed to joint transport service, with Changle in Sheng County as the exchange point. It is reported that it will be implemented starting from the 15th of this month.</p>
<h3>Former French Commander-in-Chief in China, General Destrac, Returns to France, Military Officers Stationed in Shanghai Host Farewell Banquet</h3>
<p>According to the French Shanghai Daily, General Destrac, the former Commander-in-Chief of the French Defense Forces in China, will return to his country tomorrow (the 5th) on the French postal ship "Nadette." It is reported that last night (the 3rd), French military officers stationed in Shanghai held a farewell party to send him off.</p>
<h3>How to Pay Business Income Tax: Results of Research by Banking Association, Three Proposed Methods for Reference</h3>
<p>The business income tax of each bank is required to be reported and paid within three months after the annual settlement. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, each bank has been affected by the war and suffered losses in the war zone, which have not yet been fully determined, resulting in many failures to complete the procedures as scheduled. The government, noting that most banks have not paid overdue taxes, has instructed the industry association to inform each bank to complete the reporting and payment procedures as soon as possible. The association, considering the actual difficulties of each bank, sent letters to each bank to solicit opinions, collected actual situations, and entrusted the practical research association of the Banking Society to discuss it in order to obtain an appropriate method for the industry to consider and adopt. After a multi-decision meeting, the research has yielded results, and the letter has been sent to the association for reference. The research results are as follows:</p>
<p>After multi-decision discussion by the practical research association of the case, it is believed that each bank suffered significant losses last year due to the war. The exact amount of property losses in a part of the war zone cannot be investigated. Therefore, the difficulty in preparing the final accounts is understandable. From the perspective of the banks, if they can wait until the war is over and the exact amount of losses is determined before reporting and paying taxes, it is still reasonable. However, some banks have already prepared final accounts and are ready to report and pay taxes. Therefore, they should report and pay taxes immediately. The results of the research show that the current situation of each bank is not entirely the same, so the methods adopted are naturally difficult to unify. Currently, each bank's preparation of final accounts is divided into those that have been prepared and those that have not been prepared. For those that have been prepared, the net profit exceeds 5% of the actual capital and those that do not exceed it. If the net profit exceeds 5% of the actual capital, the business income tax to be paid is also less than the already deducted income tax on public debt interest, and there is no need to pay. Therefore, in fact, it is difficult for each industry to take a unified approach. Several methods are proposed: (1) According to Article 168 of the Company Law, the annual final accounts must be approved by the shareholders' meeting. However, Article 2 of the Provisional Measures for Maintaining Profit-Making Legal Persons during Extraordinary Periods, promulgated on April 23 of this year, stipulates that the convening of shareholders' meetings and the re-election of supervisors of profit-making legal persons in or near the war zone may be postponed. Therefore, all banks that have prepared final accounts but have not yet been approved by the shareholders' meeting may postpone the reporting of total income tax on the grounds that they have not been approved by the shareholders' meeting. (2) For those whose final accounts for the 26th year have been completed and approved by the shareholders' meeting, if the percentage of their net profit to the actual capital is less than 5%, according to Article 3 of the Provisional Regulations on Income Tax, they should be exempt from paying business income tax. Furthermore, according to Article 15 of the First Category Collection Instructions, even if the net profit exceeds 5% of the actual capital, the tax payable can be offset against the previously deducted income tax on public debt interest. In fact, it may not be necessary to pay again. However, according to Article 19 of the First Category Income Tax Collection Instructions, it is still necessary to fill in a form and submit it for review. (3) For those whose final accounts for the 26th year have been prepared, but the exact amount of losses in the war zone has not yet been determined, resulting in inaccurate final accounts, the method is A. Wait until the losses in the war zone are determined before reporting and paying taxes. The exact amount of losses last year has not yet been determined, so the prepared final accounts cannot be accurate. If this is used as the tax standard, it is unfair. Therefore, after the situation is stabilized and the investigation is accurate, the tax will be verified and paid. B. Report and pay according to the provisional net profit. After the actual amount of losses is determined, complete the procedures for tax refund or supplementary tax payment. (1) Regarding the loss of property, although the loss of property in the war zone cannot be determined, the income tax may be temporarily reported and paid according to the net profit calculated according to the estimated amount. After the actual amount is determined, complete the procedures for tax refund or supplementary tax payment. (2) Regarding the elimination of bad debts, last year was affected by the war, so the bad debt provisions made can be regarded as actual losses in calculating net profit.</p>

<h3>Government Actively Assists, Inland Industry Advances Vigorously, New Methods Used to Mine Coal in Southwest, Foundation for Chemical Industry Also Being Laid</h3>
<p>In order to promote the industrial construction of various provinces in the interior, meet the needs of the people's livelihood, and support the long-term resistance war, the National Government has actively implemented the predetermined plan for more than a year, and has achieved remarkable results. Regarding iron production, a large-scale iron and steel plant has been planned and established under the leadership of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, preparing for mass production. The factory's construction is scheduled to be completed this autumn. In addition, the Ministry of Economic Affairs is assisting several private companies to engage in production. The coal production in the southwestern provinces is very rich, but the mining mostly adheres to the old methods, resulting in very low output. Now, new equipment has been added separately to mine with new methods, and it is expected to be successful in a short period of time, and the fuel supply can be enriched. Chemical industries, such as acid production, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, ammonia, etc., are also planned, and the Yongli Company, which has experience in handling this type of industry, is invited to assist in the handling, in order to lay the foundation for the chemical industry. Hydropower undertakings are also being promoted. We also actively assist the silk and paper industries to increase production. As for private factories, they are now being assisted in relocating to the interior one after another, and some of them have begun to resume production at the designated locations. With government encouragement, cotton production has greatly increased.</p>
<h3>Central Government Cooperates with HSBC to Stabilize Exchange Rate in Open Market, Although Transactions Have Increased Compared to the Past, Exchange Rate Fluctuations Are Minimal, Open Market Price No Longer Accurate Market Price</h3>
<p>The open market exchange rate in Shanghai (i.e., the black market) has increased sharply since the implementation of the import permit system. The reason for this is that some merchants have no way to apply for foreign exchange from the Central Bank, and general speculators take the opportunity to manipulate it. The current open market price is 40% lower than the legal price. However, today's Shanghai has lost its position as the national financial center. In addition, under special circumstances, its open market price is no longer an accurate market price. Since the Central Bank cooperated with HSBC to be responsible for stabilization, the exchange rate fluctuations have been minimal. Recently, since the success of the Sino-British and Sino-American loans, the exchange rate has turned for the better. The open market exchange rates for the past few months are recorded as follows: (1) British exchange rate: April, highest one shilling one penny five six two five, lowest one shilling zero three one two five; May, highest one shilling zero nine three seven five, lowest ten pence three seven five; June, highest ten pence three seven five, lowest eight pence; July, highest nine pence zero one five six two five, lowest eight pence three seven five; August, highest eight pence five six two five, lowest seven pence eight seven five; September, highest eight pence eight one two five, lowest eight pence half; October, highest eight pence half, lowest eight pence. (2) US exchange rate: April, highest 28.25 yuan, lowest 25.5 yuan; May, highest 26.875 yuan, lowest 21.475 yuan; June, highest 21.375 yuan, lowest 16.5625 yuan; July, highest 18.5 yuan, lowest 17.125 yuan; August, highest 17.375 yuan, lowest 16.125 yuan; September, highest 18 yuan, lowest 17 yuan; October, highest 17.125 yuan, lowest 15.78125 yuan.</p>
<h3>Relief Expenses for Refugees Actively Soliciting Donations, Soy Sauce Industry Assists in Soliciting Donations, Association Adds Solicitation Committee Members</h3>
<p>In order to assist in soliciting donations for refugee relief expenses, the soy sauce industry in this city has hired Fan Dongsheng, Lu Junyue, Yu Hongwen, Zhang Yunyuan, Zhang Jiasheng, Hu Benxin, Chen Jiefu, Yu Rupin, Shen Weiya, Zhang Zhaokang, Chen Zhenlin, Shen Jiaxing, Hu Shiqing, Tang Qingxiang, Shen Zhaokang, Ye Dechang, and sixteen others as solicitation committee members. After organizing the solicitation committee, they held a meeting yesterday to discuss the implementation methods. Fang Jiaobo, the director of the association's solicitation committee, attended and the following resolutions were made: (1) Elect Fan Dongsheng as the chairman of the committee, Zhang Jiefu, Zhang Jiasheng, and Hu Benxin as standing committee members. (2) The fundraising method will be based on the number of sales of urns, with an increase of 50 cents in national currency for each group, to be used as funds for refugee relief. (3) The association will formulate forms and notify all industries to fill in the numbers, with the sales amount for December of last year as the standard. (4) It is scheduled to be implemented on January 16th, and the association will publish a public announcement in the newspaper.</p>
<p>Relief Association Adds Committee Members</p>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association has now added the following solicitation committee members: Xie Xigui, Zhang Shide, Hu Gengpei, and Li Zifeng from the glasses industry; Jin Shanxin, Dong Zixing, Zhou Linxiang, Mao Wenrong, Hu Qaqin, and Zhuang Zhihe from the watch industry.</p>
<p>Fifteen Solicitation Teams Hold Meeting Record</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the 15th Solicitation Team of the Citizens' Group held a joint meeting of deputy team leaders and all executive committee members of the 31st Sub-Association at the meeting place of the 31st Sub-Association of Citizens. Zheng Fangbo, Fei Liangheng, Yu Yaoqing, Tang Linsheng, Li Jiafu, Chen Zaiyang, and over twenty others were present. Song Shixiang, the team leader, was elected as the temporary chairman to discuss refugee relief and promotion of solicitation methods. The following resolutions were made: (1) Distribute announcements to stores and households on this road, asking them to donate as they see fit. (2) This team should obtain donation forms from the solicitation committee of the citizens' group for filling out to various stores and households. The team does not handle the collection of funds. (3) The team leader and deputy team leaders, and all executive committee members of this association will set off in batches to solicit donations from door to door. (4) If there are enthusiastic gentlemen on this road who are willing to join this team, please send a letter to this sub-association, which will be welcome, or please introduce them through various deputy team leaders and executive committee members. (5) Song Shixiang introduced Li Wencai of No. 3 Wanxiang Lane on this road as the deputy team leader of this team.</p>
<p>Solicitation Achievements Published in Booklet for Credibility</p>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association Citizens' Group Solicitation Committee has been soliciting donations for refugees by broadcasting, which has been enthusiastically participated in by caring people from all walks of life, achieving good results. In order to show credibility, the association is compiling a crediting record for distribution to all walks of life to promote benevolent virtues. The paper and printing costs required for this crediting record have been donated by Dong Hefu, a kind person from Mao Fu Foreign Firm, through Zhou Bangjun, a standing committee member of the association. Dong Zhuomao, a kind person from Huifeng Paper Store, has donated the printing. The association has sent letters to thank both benefactors.</p>
<p>Wuxi Benefactor Participates in Adoption</p>
<p>The Citizens' Group Solicitation Committee's campaign to solicit donations for the adoption of refugees has been enthusiastically participated in by caring people from all walks of life in this city. Du Meibao, a kind person from Daoghang Lane in Wuxi, learned of this adoption campaign from the newspaper and generously adopted a refugee for half a year. Yesterday, he sent the adoption fee of 12 yuan through the post office. The association has sent a reply to thank Mr. Du for his enthusiastic support for the city's relief work, even though he is in another city.</p>
<p>Saving Meal Expenses to Adopt Refugees</p>
<p>The organization of the Pujiji Meal Association in this city is entirely charitable. The organizers are Chen Shaozhang and others. They hold a meal gathering once a month. The association, in view of the fact that refugees are victims of the country and suffer from their lives, has been allocating funds to charitable organizations every month from the meal expenses to cover relief expenses for a long time. Now, the association has determined that the Citizens' Group's advocacy of the refugee adoption campaign is a very practical and sustainable method. It has specifically decided to adopt 50 refugees per month starting from January of this year, saving 100 yuan in national currency from the meal expenses each month to be used as the living expenses for 50 refugees. The funds for January have been sent to the Citizens' Group for receipt. Their enthusiasm is admirable. It has been found that there are many meal gathering organizations in this city. If they can consistently save money and assist refugees as the association does, they will be able to achieve significant relief effects.</p>
<h3>Petty Thieves Rampant in Western Shanghai, Concession's Strict Precautions, Authorities Determined to Maintain Security, Strict Suppression of Traitors Hidden</h3>
<p>The Public Concession authorities, in order to rectify security and protect the safety of residents in the western Shanghai concession area due to rampant smoking dens, gambling, and bandits in the road construction area, have set up barbed wire obstacles at the key entrances and exits of the area to cut off traffic and strictly prevent them. Unexpectedly, the patrol car of the Jing'an Temple Police Station was shot at by thugs in the dark while patrolling Dunxin Road the other night. The police authorities considered the matter serious. In addition to stepping up precautions, since yesterday, they have added several large teams of armed detectives to patrol in shifts day and night. On the one hand, they have also secretly deployed detectives around the smoking dens and gambling tables. Anyone with suspicious behavior will be detained and searched. They are also afraid that unscrupulous traitors will hide in these areas or privately hide contraband. Therefore, all the houses inhabited by the people of Western Shanghai will also be investigated when necessary to ensure the safety of the concession. Therefore, the situation in Western Shanghai for the past two months has been extremely tense. Armed patrols are endless, which has never been seen before.</p>
<p>Gunfire Sounds, Four People Run Away</p>
<p>The English Great Beauty Evening News reported that this morning (the 4th), four Chinese men ran along Dunxin Road, ignoring the patrol officers' order to stop, thus becoming the target of the patrolling patrol officers. A total of four shots were fired at the suspects, but they were obviously ineffective. The details are as follows: A squad of patrol officers from the Jing'an Temple Police Station was walking along Dunxin Road. At about 3:00 AM, they heard a gunshot from somewhere on the roadside. A few seconds later, they saw four Chinese men running away. The patrol officers ordered them to stop and prepared to shoot. However, the four Chinese men suddenly hid in a side alley and moved quickly. The patrol officers quickly fired four shots at them, but the four men had disappeared into the darkness. A large number of patrol officers and White Russian merchants patrolled the roads in the area all night. In addition to the bandits, they encountered another danger. Last night, near the five-corner square on Jessfield Road, a patrol officer was knocked down by a car and suffered a concussion.</p>
<p>Bandits Attack Patrol Police Car</p>
<p>The night before last at 9:30 PM, a patrol police car of the Public Concession on Dunxin Road was suddenly attacked by bandits. The detectives in the car immediately returned fire. In the case where the bandits began to flee, it is now learned that the Central Police Station has arrested one wounded bandit. After questioning and confession yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM, the police took the arrested bandit to the Tiandesen Wine Shop at No. 420 Fahua East Town (the house is a temporary wooden house), where they arrested four men and three women, totaling seven people. Later, it was learned that the bandits had three pistols, which they sank in the Fahua River. The detectives then searched and recovered one pistol and confiscated an iron bar in the house. Together with the arrested criminals, they were taken to the Central Police Station for interrogation. However, two pistols have not yet been recovered. It is planned to order people to fish them out again today.</p>
<h3>Silver and Money Trades: Resumption of Business Today, Variously Shaped Development in All Sectors, Banks All Profitable</h3>
<p>Member banks and money shops of the Shanghai Silver and Money Trades Association, having completed their New Year's holiday, are all scheduled to resume business today. The Shanghai market is developing in a unique way, bank settlements are showing profits, and the business policy for this year is determined to be based on consolidating one's own foundation and supporting the development of various industries. All industrial and commercial sectors are preparing for the annual general closing. The details of each situation are recorded below.</p>
<p>Banks and Money Shops Resume Business Today</p>
<p>Member banks of the Bankers Association, the Joint Reserve Committee of Voice Banks, the Bankers' Acceptance House, the Clearing House, as well as member money shops of the Occupational Association, the Money Trade Reserve, the Money Trade Market, and various financial markets such as cash, public bonds, miscellaneous grains, cotton yarn, cloth, foreign exchange, and discounting, all took a four-day holiday for the New Year. This period has now ended, and it is scheduled to uniformly enter the market today, conduct business as usual, and resume office work.</p>
<p>Year-End Settlements All Profitable</p>
<p>Various banks are handling the final settlements for the year 1938. A portion of these settlements were completed before New Year's Eve, while another portion was rushed to completion during the holiday. The results all show considerable profits. The figures for the past two or three years have been reported to the Bankers Association for compilation and publication. This year, due to the war, and the fact that most government and commercial banks, such as the head offices of the Bank of Communications, have relocated inland, with Shanghai only being a branch, the profit figures for each bank this year are not yet determined for public release.</p>
<p>Business Policy Strives for Stability</p>
<p>The business policy of various banks in Shanghai has been to adopt a prudent approach since the outbreak of the war. They have been quite cautious with various loans. Moreover, the population of Shanghai has increased after the war, the demand for goods exceeds supply, and factories are operating day and night to rush production, creating a uniquely developed phenomenon. The market has suddenly become active, so the funds released before and after the war can be recovered as scheduled. The business policy of each bank this year is also determined to be based on consolidating its own position, supporting the development of industrial and commercial sectors, utilizing funds, and assisting the government in developing the southwest, to increase wealth.</p>
<p>Various Sectors Prepare for General Closing</p>
<p>The period for the year-end general closing of various industrial and commercial sectors in Shanghai has always relied on the money trade. The general closing period for the money trade has traditionally been Lunar New Year's Eve. This year, Lunar New Year's Eve is February 18th. The money trade has decided to conduct its general closing on this day. Various industrial and commercial sectors are also preparing for this by planning ahead, actively promoting business, and because the local production in various guerrilla areas is on the verge of collapse, they are all flocking to Shanghai to purchase goods. Therefore, the business of various sectors is particularly prosperous. This year's general closing is determined to be able to be passed safely.</p>
<h3>West District Car Robbery Case Cracked, Thirteen Criminals Captured</h3>
<p>Public Concession police, yesterday, together with Japanese military police, searched villages and towns in the western district of Shanghai. As a result, several bandits who robbed a foreigner's car a few days ago were all captured. The arrested include ten men and three women. Several pistols were also seized, one of which belonged to a Municipal Council police officer and was robbed in recent weeks. During the search, the police surrounded the newly built houses along the Suzhou River. The bandits attempted to escape, and the police fired automatic rifles and machine guns, but there were no casualties.</p>
<h3>Hundreds of Dock Workers Request Relief, Renji Hall Unable to Accommodate, Relief Association Trying to Find a Solution</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, cargo transportation in Shanghai has declined. Nantong and Guangzhou have fallen, and Ningbo and Dinghai have restricted the entry of ships, making it even more difficult for a group of workers who rely on cargo packages at the docks for a living. Apart from barely managing to eat, their clothes are tattered. Even in the severe cold weather, they still wear summer clothes and sleep on the streets and alleys at night, as well as in small barges along the river. Since the beginning of winter, several people have been frozen to death in the Bund area every day. Yesterday morning at 10 a.m., hundreds of dock workers, with a signed petition, gathered at the entrance of Renji Hall and elected five representatives to enter and request relief. The reception department of Renji Hall received them, but due to financial difficulties, they were unable to accommodate them. The representatives then went to the Refugee Relief Association, requesting to be received by the person in charge of the association. They were promised that they would try to find a solution. They then withdrew and informed the workers to disperse.</p>
<h3>Ding Xisan Inspects Defense of Various Counties, Provincial Government Restores Administrative Institutions, Appoints County Magistrates and Assigns Commissioners</h3>
<p>Previously, the Japanese army invaded Pudong and, after more than ten days of resistance by the Chinese mobile troops, suffered heavy losses. As a result, they returned empty-handed. Therefore, there are now very few traces of the Japanese army in various places in Fengxian and Nanhui. However, Ding Xisan, the commander of the 8th Detachment of the Loyal Patriotic Salvation Army, believes that the current expansion and distribution of his subordinates along the</p>
<p>Jiangsu and Zhejiang Coasts</p>
<p>as well as the Fengxian, Nanhui, Songhu area, after this battle, should be reorganized and improved to facilitate offense and defense. He recently inspected various places, including Tinglin, Zhangyan, Songyin, Yexie in the west, and Lujiahui, Hangtou, Li灶, Xinchang in the east, Zhapu, Hujiaqiao, Qingcun Port, Nanhui, Zhuanqiao, and Wujiaxiang along the Pu River in the suburbs of Shanghai in the south, spanning six or seven counties. He has redeployed the troops in various places and requested instructions from his superiors to determine new offensive and defensive strategies for future opportune offensives. As for</p>
<p>Nearby Counties</p>
<p>the Jiangsu Provincial Government has now restored administrative institutions, appointed county magistrates, with Cai Renxi as the county magistrate of Shanghai County and concurrently the Administrative Inspector Commissioner, Li Leng as the county magistrate of Songjiang, Ruan Kaiji for Fengxian, Yu Taosheng for Nanhui, Tang Yaoyu for Chuansha, and Bao Buchao as the commissioner separately established for Pudong. Evidenced by the above situation, the suburbs are almost entirely under the control of the Chinese army.</p>
<h3>Professor Kang Huandong's Steadfast Aspirations</h3>
<p>Professor Kang Huandong is a veteran of the Chinese judicial community. Several years ago, he left his official career and came to Shanghai to teach at China Public School, Great China University, Fudan University, Political Science College, Law School, and other schools. He often used moral integrity and aspirations as his teachings and was highly respected by students. He is currently still teaching at the Law School and Great China University. A clarification notice from the professor was suddenly seen in the newspaper a few days ago. Yesterday, his friends specially visited Kang to inquire about this matter. The professor sincerely told them, "I have served in the political arena for decades, and there are countless colleagues and old friends. At this time of turmoil, it is inevitable that some acquaintances are listed as 'new nobles'. Some short-sighted people, not examining the reality, only see my old friends among the 'new nobles' and mistakenly believe that I can also change my aspirations. This kind of pointless speculation arises from this. They do not know that I read the Spring and Autumn Annals in my youth and deeply understand the great principles. Therefore, in addition to teaching, I often cite the personalities of those who in ancient times were loyal to the people to inspire students' integrity in this time of national crisis. This can be asked of all the students I teach. Now, I am frail and ill and cannot actively serve to save the nation from danger, which is already a matter of regret. How can I do things that are harmful to the nation? I tell you now, even if I lose my job in the future and fall into poverty, I would rather die of hunger and cold than change my original aspirations." The professor's tone was passionate and his demeanor was serious. The reporter paid his respects and left.</p>

<h3>Iron Factory Owner Extortion Case, Criminals Awaiting Detailed Investigation, Criminals Confess Iron Factory Owner Sells Iron to the Enemy, Confession Made Regarding Huang Jisheng Case</h3>
<p>Zhu Zhongsheng, a 35-year-old man from Chuansha, residing at 312 Rue Latreille in the French Concession, recently impersonated a guerrilla commander and sent a letter to Room 531 of the Zhonghui Building in the French Concession, extorting 20,000 yuan from Huang Peng (currently residing in Henry Lane, formerly operating an iron factory in Nanshi). The two parties met at Room 104 of the Weida Hotel on Avenue Joffre. As a result of the negotiations, it was resolved with 5,000 yuan. Public bond tickets worth 1,000 yuan were used for payment. Now Zhu's father sent a letter to 358 Rue Fulu, to Huang Jisheng's home</p>
<p>Plotting to Extort a Large Sum</p>
<p>Unsuccessfully. This was discovered by the French Police Department, which dispatched detectives at 2 p.m. on December 30th of last year. First, Bao Chongzhen, a man from Pudong, was arrested in Room 15 of the Dalai Hotel on Rue Gascogne, and a 1,000 yuan public bond ticket was found. Then, the main culprit Zhu Zhongsheng and related persons Zhou Junmei (30 years old, from Jiading), Zhang Yaozhong (21 years old, from Pudong), Zhang Guojun (28 years old, from Pudong), Zhang Amao (30 years old, from Pudong), Zhang Fengxiang (32 years old, from Pudong), etc. were successively arrested, and</p>
<p>Handguns Seized</p>
<p>One handgun, two hand grenades, and drafts of threatening letters, stationery symbols, etc. in a large leather suitcase were taken back to the police station for investigation. The details have been briefly reported in the newspaper. Yesterday, the police station escorted the defendants and others to the First Special District Court's Criminal Division 1, where Judge Zhang Minsheng interrogated them. According to the attorney Gu Shouxi, representing the French Concession administrative authorities, the police department needs to conduct a detailed investigation of the case of the defendants' intimidation and extortion, and requested that the defendants be detained and the case investigated at a later date.</p>
<p>Request to Hear the Case</p>
<p>Following this, detectives reported the process of solving the case. When Zhu Zhongsheng was questioned, he confessed that because Huang Peng was a big traitor and sold steel to the enemy for profit, he extorted 5,000 yuan from him. Although he went to Huang Jisheng three times to threaten him and attached two bullets to the letter, asking him for 50,000 yuan, he gave up because he found no evidence that Huang was a traitor. Bao Chongzhen confessed that Zhu Zhongsheng owed him 200 yuan, and now he used the 1,000 yuan public bond ticket as compensation, and he did not know that it was obtained through intimidation and</p>
<p>Extorted Funds</p>
<p>The people did not participate in the intimidation. Zhang Yaozhong confessed that he worked for Zhu Zhongsheng, and the threatening letter was written by Zhou Junmei, but it was just to warn them. When questioned, Zhou admitted to writing the letter. Zhang Amao, Zhang Fengxiang, Zhang Guojun, etc. confessed that they were friends with Zhu and went to visit him that day. They did not know about the extortion. Judge Zhang verified the confession and ruled that the hearing would be postponed to January 18. The defendants were taken back into custody.</p>
<h3>French Concession Public Works Department Awards Medals to Garrison Troops in Recognition of Their Continued Labor During the War</h3>
<p>The French Concession Public Works Department of this port awarded 58 medals to the French troops stationed in Shanghai for their outstanding work during the war. In addition to their commander, Beletti, receiving a gold medal, the remaining 29 people received silver medals and 28 people received bronze medals.</p>
<h3>Six Puppets Compete to Be Town Head</h3>
<p>In the Pudong area along the Pu River, the puppet "municipal government" is cooperating with the Japanese Marine Corps to promote a puppet "autonomous system" in an attempt to deceive the public. They have established puppet "town offices" in various towns and are looking for small puppets to fill the role of puppet "town head." It is learned that in Changzhan Town, there are now six traitors competing for the position of puppet "town head." (1) Fan Futang, the puppet "Self-Praising Corps Commander"; (2) Yao Jinxiang, the puppet "Self-Defense Corps Deputy Commander"; (3) Chen Zhusheng, formerly a Baochang; (4) Ma Yigen, a translator for the 5th Battalion of the Japanese Navy, who used to be a tailor in Japan; (5) Chuan Azhu, also a translator for the 5th Battalion of the Japanese Navy, who came from the same background as Ma; (6) Gu Liangsi, who opened the Gu Liangji Shrewd Hospital in Shiba Jian, and is also the puppet "Maintenance Association Chairman" of Shiba Jian. Among these six people, the first three are backed by the 3rd Battalion of the Navy, and the last three are protected by the 5th Battalion of the Japanese Navy. They are all doing their best to compete, hosting banquets in turn, inviting Japanese and puppet officials to feast. Because the forces of both sides are equal, it has not yet been possible to produce a result. The outcome of who will win is unknown. The outside world is paying close attention to this ridiculous farce.</p>

<h3>Private Counterfeit Cigarette Manufacturing Operation Cracked on Wuding Road, Internal False Walls and Fake Doors, Layers of Secret Chambers, Confiscated Counterfeit Cigarettes and Accomplices</h3>
<p>The Public Concession Police Department suddenly received a confidential report on the morning of the first day of the new year that someone had secretly set up a cigarette manufacturing operation inside No. 921 Wuding Road, Maigen Road, imitating the products of the British American Tobacco Company, requesting to crack the case. After receiving the report, the Police Department immediately ordered the Central Police Station to dispatch a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives to secretly arrest them at the address. The layout of the operation was extremely elaborate, mysterious, and unpredictable. Entering it was like entering a maze. Fortunately, the detectives were quick and agile, and they were able to explore their way in. They saw false walls and fake doors everywhere in the rooms. After searching for a while, they finally managed to enter the machine room, where more than ten workers were working diligently beside the machines. They were immediately arrested. Then, they ordered the workers to lead them into the storeroom and office, where they found several molds of counterfeit Da Ying, Pin Hai, and Lao Dao brand cigarette boxes, 100,000 counterfeit cigarettes that had been rolled, as well as countless tobacco, advertisements, flyers, etc. They were then moved out one by one, and the cigarette-making machines were dismantled. Together with the 13 suspects captured, they were taken back to the police station. After a brief interrogation, they were temporarily detained, awaiting escort to the court for investigation. A search is underway for the main culprit to thoroughly investigate the inside story.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in Tonghai Makes Moves, Fierce Fighting for Days, Nearly 100 Japanese Soldiers Killed or Wounded</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a gentleman came to Shanghai from Haimen, talked about the guerrilla warfare situation in Tonghai, and I quickly recorded it to inform the fellow villagers in Shanghai. (1) Recently, the Japanese army in Tonghai launched attacks in multiple directions, claiming to clear the countryside, and using the newly completed South Trunk Road as a key route for troop movement, riding in cars, armored vehicles, trucks, and horses, carrying new-style weapons, and rushing around all day long to create a false show of strength. One route advanced along Guanyin Mountain and Sanxu Town, another route attacked Xiting Jinsha from Kan Jia'an, and another route attacked from Ba Chang and Luhongzha. On the Haimen side, one route has already occupied the county seat, and another route attacked Sijiaba in Nantong County. County Magistrate Peng led his elite troops to intercept them separately. After several days of fierce fighting, Yuxi, Jiangzao Port, Sanxu Town, Xiting, Dongshe, and Erjia Town have been recovered. Jinsha was once recovered, but is now recaptured by the enemy. The southern Xiaohai Town and Chuan Port Town are also stationed with enemy troops, and residents are fleeing to the surrounding countryside. (2) The Japanese army harassing Sijiaba is said to be taking a shortcut to attack Jiulong Town. Peng's troops are now joining forces with allied troops to guard Qian to the west of Sijiaba and jointly encircle the enemy in Dongling. At the same time, they are starting to destroy the South Trunk Road. According to intelligence, in the continuous battles, more than 20 Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded in Sijiaba. There are more than 40 wounded being transported from Yuxi Jinsha to Tangzha, including three squad leaders. The Japanese army in Tangzha held a meeting to mourn them. Our army also suffered considerable losses. (3) The new County Magistrate of Haimen, Sun Xinfu, has not yet taken office. People from Haimen in Shanghai are hoping that Sun will be able to refresh the county administration, unify command, and recover the Japanese army's strongholds in Sanchang City as soon as possible, so that the order of the whole county can be gradually restored.</p>

<h3>Transportation Company Owner Accused of Fraudulently Obtaining Money, Falsely Reporting Quantity of Transported Machines, Fraudulently Obtaining Freight Charges, Imprisonment for Three Months</h3>
<p>Meiheng Textile Co., Ltd., located at 207 Tianjin Road, has its main factory in Wuxi. Since the outbreak of the war and the westward movement of the National Army, Wuxi has fallen. All the machines in the factory were not moved out in time. On December 12th of last year, Xu Juchang, a representative of Meiheng Factory, wanted to find a way to transport the machines out of the Wuxi factory, so he consulted with Sun Jianshi, the owner of Haima Transportation Company, located at 14th Museum Road, who was from Wuxi.</p>
<p>Entrusting Transportation</p>
<p>At that time, it was agreed that the freight for each dan of machine would be 3 yuan, 8 jiao, and an advance payment of 4,250 yuan would be made. Until December 30th of last year, Sun Jianshi of Haima Transportation Company notified Meiheng Textile Company that all the machines that had been transported out were 3,400 dans, totaling 12,920 yuan. In addition to the advance payment received, 8,670 yuan was still owed. At that time, Xu Xuechang, a representative of Meiheng, paid 8,000 yuan, and the remaining 670 yuan was waived, as a settlement. However, after Meiheng found that only 2,523 dans of machines had been transported out, a shortage of 877 dans, Sun Jianshi had</p>
<p>Falsely Reported Numbers</p>
<p>Fraudulently obtained more than 2,000 yuan. After repeated negotiations, they were unsuccessful. Xu Xuechang then hired two lawyers, Qian Zheng and Yao Junyu, to report to the General Police Department, which ordered Chinese detectives Kang Zengxiang and Zhou Zhenxing to arrest Sun Jianshi and search Sun's bedroom, Room 30, Lianyuan Inn, 666 Hankou Road, and seize 1,600 yuan in legal tender. All were taken back to the police station for detention. This morning, they were escorted to the Criminal Court 4 of the First Special District Court. The police station lawyers Zhang Shizhu and Jiang Baolian, in accordance with Article 339 of the Criminal Law,</p>
<p>Fraudulently Obtained Money</p>
<p>filed charges, and stated the above situation and requested an investigation. Subsequently, the plaintiff's attorneys, Qian Zheng and Yao Junyu, rose to state that the case had already been settled out of court, so they requested leniency for the defendant. When questioned, the defendant Sun Jianshi confessed, "I transported the machines of Meiheng, and in total, it was many trips back and forth from Wuxi to Shanghai. The first two trips were all weighed, but the third trip was due to</p>
<p>Special Circumstances</p>
<p>in Wuxi, and in a hurry, they were loaded onto a large transport ship to Shanghai, and together with the staff of Meiheng, the weight was slightly skipped. However, because the cost of this trip was greater than the previous two, I asked the plaintiff to increase the freight. Unexpectedly, he reported it to the police station, and I was arrested. I really had no intention of deliberately falsely reporting the quantity to defraud the freight." Judge Fang verified the confession and sentenced Xu Xuechang to fraud, imprisonment for three months, allowed to be released on bail of 500 yuan, and the confiscated legal tender was returned to the plaintiff for collection.</p>
<p>Ge Mingsheng was found by a patrol officer and summoned an ambulance to the Shanghai East Hospital for treatment. At noon that day, the victim Xu Fangfu returned home and only then learned that he had been robbed. Not knowing that it was his cousin Xu Fangqing who had released the dragon, he had to report to the Yangshupu Police Station based on the intelligence. The Chinese detectives Jin Wanrong, Liu Changgen, and Lu Yisheng investigated and learned that the inner thread of the case was his cousin Xu Fangqing, who at noon yesterday</p>
<p>Arrested His Cousin First</p>
<p>confessed his accomplices, Ju Yuhu, Liu Shunliang, Wang Asan, Chen Deliang, Yuan Jiulin, and others. They secretly went to the Shenxin No. 6 Factory on Hejian Road, arrested them all, and took them to the police station for detention. This morning, they were escorted to the Criminal Court 3 of the First Special District Court. The police station lawyer Zhang Tianyin elaborated on the details of the case, and learned that Ge Mingsheng, one of the robbers, was seriously injured in the hospital and his life was in danger. He requested a postponement. Judge Jiang Shuzi questioned the defendants and ordered them to be taken back into custody and re-examined at a later date.</p>
<h3>Italian Ship Searched, Gold Bars Found, Passengers Not Detained</h3>

<h3>Dispute over Shortage of Coal Balls Leads to Fatal Case, Old Steward Dies Tragically from Mistakenly Taking Injury Medicine</h3>
<p>Chen Fuyuan, a 31-year-old man from Yuyao, was an old steward in a certain coal shop on Parker Road. The day before yesterday afternoon, he was ordered by the shop to deliver a load of coal balls to No. 9, Hongan Lane, Haining Road. At that time, the female owner of the house saw that the coal balls in the load seemed different, so she questioned him and weighed them. Sure enough, there was a shortage. As a result, a dispute arose between the two parties, and neither would give way. The male owner of the house came out and reprimanded Chen. Chen did not respond, which led to a mutual fight. In the end, they were dispersed by others. In the evening, Chen suddenly felt pain in his waist, fearing that he had been beaten. The shop owner bought him a dose of injury medicine and told him to take it and sleep. Unexpectedly, after midnight, his condition suddenly worsened and he was in great pain. His shop friends saw that his complexion had changed and feared the worst, so they quickly sent him to the hospital for treatment. Unexpectedly, he died in the hospital due to mistakenly taking the injury medicine, and there was no way to save him. The hospital reported the case to the police station, and the body was sent to the morgue for examination.</p>
<h3>Police News: Robbery</h3>
<p>At around 7:15 PM yesterday, four robbers suddenly broke into the residence of a Mr. [Surname] at No. 3533 Hart Road. The robbers tricked their way into opening the front door. Two of the robbers, armed with guns, entered the house first and threatened the men and women inside, forbidding them from making any noise. They then forced them to hand over the keys to their chests and proceeded to ransack the place. After about half an hour, they let out a whoop and fled. Upon inspecting the losses, it was discovered that the robbers had stolen a significant amount of clothing, cash, and jewelry. A detailed list of the stolen items was immediately submitted to the local police station, requesting them to investigate and apprehend the culprits.</p>
<p>House Collapse</p>
<p>At around 2:20 PM yesterday, the residence of a Mr. Cao, a native of Jiangbei, located at No. 15, Alley 322, Yangzhou Road, Yangshupu, in the eastern part of Shanghai, collapsed due to years of disrepair. As the north wind howled fiercely, the house, unable to withstand the onslaught, suddenly gave way with a loud crash that startled the neighborhood. An urgent report was made to the police station, who then notified the fire brigade. A rescue vehicle was dispatched to the scene, and efforts were made to sift through the debris. As a result, the body of a man, approximately 40 years old, who had been crushed to death by the collapsed house, was pulled out. It was believed that he was a resident of the house, but due to the mangled state of the body, it was difficult to identify him. The body was first sent to the hospital for cleaning before being transferred to the coroner's office, pending examination by the court.</p>
<p>Fire Alert</p>
<p>At around 3:00 AM yesterday, a fire broke out at the Zhu Qinchang [Shop Name] at No. 12 Rue du Consulat in the French Concession. Due to negligence, paper materials caught fire and burned rapidly. The fire brigade was dispatched to the scene and extinguished the fire after three hours of continuous spraying. The police are currently investigating the cause of the fire.</p>

<h3>Dr. Yu Nai'an Discusses Reasons for Smallpox Epidemic</h3>
<p>Recently, smallpox has been prevalent in this city, with many infants being infected. Even adults who have been vaccinated once or twice are experiencing recurrences this year. According to Dr. Yu Nai'an, a Shanghai specialist in measles and smallpox (clinic address: No. 1, Lane 2, Liuxian Village, Route Magy, south of the Sino-French School), the severity of the smallpox epidemic this year is rare in the past 30 years. The reasons are that the population of Shanghai has increased, and residents in the interior delay vaccinating their infants. Often, they procrastinate and do not vaccinate until the age of two or three. With the onset of winter and the abnormal weather, the epidemic has spread more widely. It is hoped that residents of this city will pay attention. Whether adults or children, all should be vaccinated once to prevent the disease.</p>

<h3>Gambling Losses, Gang Robbery of Clan Brother, Carrying Loot and Fleeing Encounter Another Gang of Thieves, All Thieves Apprehended and Held for Investigation</h3>
<p>Xu Fangfu, a native of Yangzhou residing at No. 84 Puai Fang, Zhoujiapai Road, is a coppersmith at the Electric Light Company and has a modest family income. He lives in the same room with his distant cousin, Xu Fangqing. Recently, Xu Fangqing lost money gambling and developed bad intentions. He discussed robbing his clan brother Xu Fangfu's property with his colleagues from the Shenxin Sixth Factory on Hejian Road, Jiangbei natives Ju Yuhu, Liu Shunliang, Wang Asan, Chen Deliang, Yuan Jiulin, and others. Around 9:00 PM on the afternoon of the 30th of last month, these people hid two sharp knives in their sleeves and went to attempt the robbery. When they arrived, the gate was closed, and they knocked but no one opened it. Suddenly, a patrolman came from afar, and the group panicked and fled in succession. Around 5:00 AM the next morning, they brought flashlights and went again. They rushed in through the back door. Xu Fangfu had already gone to work at the Electric Light Factory. Ju Yuhu took out a sharp knife and threatened Xu's wife, Wang, forbidding her from making a sound. They robbed a clothing chest and rushed out the door. While traveling near Funing Road on Lan Road, they encountered another gang of five thieves who blocked their path and forced them to open the chest to check what was inside. At first, Ju Yuhu and the others were afraid because the other group had handguns and they could not resist. Then, they saw that there were no firearms, so they took out sharp knives and stabbed Ge Shengming, who was examining the clothes inside the chest, in the buttocks. Chen Deliang also took out a sharp knife and slashed Ge's left chest, causing a serious wound. Ge fell to the ground, dying. The other four members of Ge's gang were shocked and took the opportunity to escape. Ju Yuhu and the other five people carried the clothing chest to the home of their friend Liu Yujing at No. 135 Danyang Road, opened the chest, took out 185 French dollars, and divided the spoils with Xu Fang and dispersed. Later, the injured</p>

<h3>Finance: Shanghai Gold Breaks Through $2,000 Mark, Up $11 Before Closure, Shortage of Chips, Price Easy to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai gold cash market, though due to the New Year holiday, the sentiment of all parties became prosperous again due to the sharp rise in British pure gold. The Hong Kong gang's desire to buy gold is also increasing, and they are buying at high prices. Moreover, the city's gold reserves have been exhausted by the Hong Kong gang and Tianjin gang, so the circulating chips have become scarce, and the price has repeatedly risen. According to unofficial prices, it has broken through the $2,000 mark. It is said that a certain money exchange business received dozens of taels from new colleagues at a price of $1,993 (because the color was slightly inferior, it was reduced by several yuan), and then received 30 taels from a customer at a price of $2,000. Another money exchange business searched for more than 100 taels for the Hong Kong gang at prices of $2,000 and $2,003, which were all supplied by colleagues and local gangs.</p>
<p>Ornamental Gold Hangs at $202</p>
<p>Jewelry gold in jewelry stores has not increased during the holidays, and the original price is still suspended. Da Tong Hang hangs at $202, Xin Tong Hang $200 (received at $194-5)</p>
<p>Pure Gold Rises Another 5 Pence</p>
<p>Also, the London electricity on the 3rd, British pure gold has been affected by the sharp contraction of the British exchange rate, so the rising wind is increasing, and each ounce has increased by 5 pence, reaching 7 pounds and 10 and a half pence (a total of 5 pence compared to before the holiday)</p>
<h3>London Silver Bars, Unprecedented Surge, Indian Silver Continues to be High</h3>
<p>London electricity on the 3rd, some people covered their positions, the supply was limited, but the entrants felt satisfied. After the market closed, the market was very trance. The recent period was soft, the listed price was 1.875 lower than the price. The forward period was flat and soft. Silver bars recently soared by 1.0625, reaching 21.125. The forward period also rose by half a pence, to 20.125. New York, the price of American silver is still in short supply, and the Mongbai electricity, the Indian silver market is quite buoyant, and the spot price has risen by 3 anna, and the near and far futures have also risen by 2 anna.</p>
<h3>Yarn Flower Prediction Today, Yarn Price Should Have a Good Side, Cotton is also Difficult to See Loose</h3>
<p>According to a certain yarn merchant's news yesterday, there is an image of Zhejiang East activity, but yarn merchants are unwilling to sell rashly in this closure, and they must wait for the market to open today to observe the general trend before making a business plan. Therefore, a compromise could not be reached. According to the above situation, today's market price should have a good side. I also heard that 70 pieces of cotton yarn were transported to Tianjin, 40 pieces were transported to Yantai, and 5 pieces were transported to Xiamen, 240 pieces were transported to Shantou, 5 pieces were transported to Haikou, and 4 pieces were transported to Beihai. 110 pieces were transported to Haiphong. Also, the cotton market, at the end of last year, all factories were at a standstill, and the market was sluggish, but according to the opinions of most colleagues, the market will be difficult to loosen after the opening. The control of a certain party is very allowed. The price of Su North cotton is quite low, and Myanmar wool is all within the 50 yuan mark. However, the outer transport layer has a troublesome process and is extremely difficult. There are many kinds of miscellaneous taxes, with many items and different categories. There are transit taxes, passes, special taxi taxes, export taxes, in other words, the purpose is to cut money easily. It is said that each burden is added to Shanghai, adding up to fifteen or sixteen yuan, and farmers and merchants are crying incessantly in this environment. Therefore, the selling price of Shendi Tonghua is between sixty-four and five yuan. Yesterday, a large amount of Yaohua was reported to be imported, estimated at more than 10,000 bags, and several thousand bags are still on the way. There is no problem with the market, and all the previous discarded goods have been delivered to the factory in succession. Also, 180 pieces of cotton were transported from Xingang, and 60 pieces were exported to Japan.</p>
<h3>Overseas Consumption Soars: Indian Cotton Reaches New High Since May</h3>
<p>Foreign cotton prices: New York cotton market opened with a slight drop of three to five points due to sluggish trading. Later, according to statistical reports, cloth transactions were booming during the holidays, boosting confidence. Simultaneously, due to firm gold prices, brokers, firms, and exporters engaged in large transactions, resulting in a closing price that rose six to seven points higher than before the holiday. In recent days, Indian cotton prices have been rising continuously for many days due to a surge in overseas consumption of Indian cotton, coupled with previous rumors that the Indian government would reduce acreage last year. Consequently, various firms and exporters have been actively purchasing, pushing cotton prices to their highest level since May. This is truly worthy of our countrymen's attention. Egyptian cotton prices are exceptionally weak, falling another six to seven points yesterday. Yesterday was a bank holiday, so there were no exchange rates, and thus no spot market prices.</p>
<p>Local foreign cotton trading was quiet yesterday as most yarn mills were still on holiday. However, all Japanese cotton firms have already resumed operations. Yesterday, the British-owned Lun Chang Dyeing Factory ordered 1,000 bales of lower-grade long-staple American cotton from Fu Jia and Mei An foreign firms, with payment terms of immediate cash upon loading. Due to the bank closures, the purchase was based on gold prices, at 9.5 cents per pound, equivalent to 84 yuan per unit including tax and delivery to the factory.</p>
<h3>Grains: Changshu Coarse Rice Reaches 9.5 Yuan; Shanghai Market Shows Tightening Again; Rice, Wheat, and Grains Are Exported</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the source of domestic rice was limited to eight or nine boats of goods from Hexia and one or two thousand packages of military rations. The outlets on this street and in storage yards are not as active as before. However, it is said that after Japanese companies monopolized Changshu and other places, the price of coarse rice unexpectedly soared to 9.45 yuan, equivalent to 12.56 yuan in the Shanghai market. As a result, sellers are very firm and holding on tightly, and the market is showing signs of tightening again. The prices of both thick and thin粳 rice have increased slightly, but only Yangjian rice has a wide distribution, still fetching a premium of one角. Du Yangjian rice is also quite stable, and Yin Yuan rice remains strong due to shortages, while Bian Yuan rice is also tight. Today, 1,300 packages of rice will be shipped to Xiamen.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, 2,900 packages of flour were shipped to Dalian, and today another 1,000 packages will be shipped to Xiamen and 3,500 packages to Shantou.</p>
<p>Also, yesterday, 370 packages of wheat came from Xinxiang.</p>
<p>Today, another 3,000 packages of bran and 120 packages of beans will be shipped to Xiamen, and 150 packages of beans to Shantou.</p>
<h3>Whole Lot Transactions of Hakka Xian Rice: Decision Awaited Today and Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there was a slight arrival of Hakka Xian rice, but digestion was weak. After the street had smoothly handled Hakka and local Xian rice the previous days, their appetite had turned sluggish, and Hakka gangs and Japanese merchants had not yet initiated transactions. Therefore, only three to four hundred packages were traded in small quantities throughout the day. Although there were negotiations for whole lot transactions, a decision is still required today or tomorrow. The opening quotations were slightly higher than the previous market, but the situation quickly stabilized.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Re-exported Raw White Sugar Rises by 5 Fen</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trended towards stability. The guild set the price for spot 24 Dutch raw white sugar at 24.45 yuan per unit for goods in the warehouse, with no change. However, re-exported goods rose by 5 fen, with transactions at 16.25 yuan. Taikoo refined white sugar spot goods in Puxi remained at 24 yuan, while goods in Pudong were quoted up by 1角. Domestic sugar was stable. More than a thousand packages of Chaoqing sugar continued to be offered, with Huanggangqing at 12 yuan, and the next grade at 11.80 to 11.75 yuan. Several hundred packages of Shangmian red sugar were sold at 14.80 to 14.67 yuan, and over a hundred packages of Hainan red sugar fetched a higher price of 11 yuan. Jianbang offered over two hundred packages of Diaoqing sugar at 11.1 yuan, which settled at 10.09 yuan. One hundred and ten packages of Xing red sugar were sold at 14.7 to 14.3 yuan, and dozens of packages of miscellaneous white sugar were sold for 18.1 yuan.</p>
<h3>Dried and Fresh Produce: Guangdong and Hong Kong Gangs Actively Purchase Hunan Lotus Seeds</h3>
<p>Hunan lotus seeds are in tight supply because both the Guangdong and Hong Kong gangs have been actively purchasing them in recent days. The market is very tight, and the previous quote of 120 yuan has been settled. Transactions on this street are also very active, so there are more merchants holding on to their goods. Yesterday, the market was re-quoted at 122 yuan, compared to the settled price of 180 yuan.</p>
<p>Today, there are 1,950 packages of raw peanuts.</p>
<p>Seafood: Winter Shark Fins Sell Well</p>
<p>Shark fins, according to usual practice, sell better at the end of the year. Recently, various grades have been sold, with prices ranging from 800 to 1,000 yuan per担 for Luzon King, 600 to 700 yuan for Tongbai, 700 to 900 yuan for Ding Sha, large and small Ersha are in short supply, 250 to 300 yuan for Sisha, 580 yuan for Duichi, 400 to 550 yuan for Mianqun, and Shangqing Pidai has also recently been out of stock, with Wugou at 170 to 280 yuan, Wupi at 100 to 200 yuan, and Wuyang at 40 to 100 yuan.</p>
<h3>Imports and Exports: Cargo Traffic Between Shanghai and Ningbo Is Quite Substantial</h3>
<p>Since the opening of Ningbo, outgoing cargo from this city has been exceptionally congested. A large batch of sugar, piece goods, cotton yarn, and soybean oil has already been shipped. This morning, a German ship going to Ningbo carried more than 2,000 packages of sugar, more than 1,800 pieces of piece goods, and more than 700 pieces of cotton yarn. Incoming goods are also plentiful. Yesterday morning, a foreign merchant shipped more than 14,740 of cotton from Ningbo, a substantial amount. It is said that there is still a large batch waiting to be loaded in Ningbo. Also, the day before yesterday (the 3rd), a foreign merchant shipped more than 5,280 pieces of 儿子 from Wenzhou.</p>

<h3>Finance Section: Economic Data: Shanghai Financial Statistics Chart for 1938 (Summary of This Newspaper's Weekly Business Summary)</h3>
<p>Entering 1938, Shanghai had unfortunately fallen. Fortunately, through the calming of public sentiment and the arduous efforts of all sectors, Shanghai's overall social economy was spared from disruption. The financial aspect was particularly stable. Since the resumption of newspaper publication, a weekly business summary has been published. To facilitate reference for all parties, we have specially compiled a summary of the past year and drawn a curve chart to allow readers to clearly understand the changes in general trends. We hope all sectors will pay attention.</p>
<p>Negotiable Instruments</p>
<p>After the establishment of the bank draft acceptance center, negotiable instruments clearly developed. Since the beginning of the war, the reduction in the circulation of negotiable instruments is definitely not due to a lack of creditworthiness. The main reason is the contraction of credit by the banking and financial sectors.</p>
<p>Interest Rates</p>
<p>Since the currency reform, the financial circles in Shanghai have gradually entered an era of low-interest rates. The authorities have also assisted in promoting the low-interest rate policy to promote the start of the national economic construction movement. However, since the August 13th Incident, banking and finance have been contracting credit, and the government authorities have been vigorously implementing currency contraction. Although the Shanghai interest rate market has not skyrocketed, it is enough to show a glimpse of the stability of the financial market.</p>
<p>Domestic Debt</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the stock exchange was ordered to suspend operations. Therefore, bonds after August 13th last year no longer had a legitimate market. The table below lists the shadow market prices. The emergence of the shadow market is said to have been caused by investors raising funds, which was then exploited by speculators. Now, the black market is used to maintain the bond market. Is this using poison to fight poison? Observing the rebound in the bond market in recent months, although stimulated by the bright prospects of the War of Resistance, the fact that someone is maintaining it cannot be denied.</p>
<p>(Note) All figures from August 1938 are Dawn Market prices, unit: National Currency Yuan. The total average index of each bond is based on the full price.</p>
<p>Gold Market</p>
<p>The fluctuation of gold prices in Shanghai is undoubtedly affected by the price of British gold. However, the rise in Shanghai gold is far more intense than that of British gold, which is undoubtedly stimulated by the outflow of funds. This trend became more obvious after April 1938. In autumn, British gold skyrocketed, and the rise in Shanghai gold became even more out of control.</p>
<p>(Note) Before August 1937, it was the price of Standard Gold. In September of the same year, it was the price of Standard Gold. From October to April 1938, it was the bank's purchase price of spot goods. After that, it was the closing price of the cash shadow market (Standard Gold per bar weighs ten Shanghai taels, equivalent to slightly more than eight and a half Treasury taels). The number of pence per ounce in London is the average price for the whole month.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>For half a year after the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, China's foreign exchange remained stable. However, since the Japanese side created the "Federated Reserve Bank" and issued counterfeit banknotes in North China, China implemented controls to prevent foreign exchange from being lost, and gradually progressed to managing foreign trade. Those who lost their conscience took the opportunity to enter and exit the black market and were willing to be used by others, which is why the foreign exchange market plummeted. The table below shows the black market prices after March. The central bank's listing and its supply to those who are approved are still calculated according to the legal exchange rate and have never changed.</p>
<p>(Note) From March 1938, based on the average closing price of the foreign exchange black market, unit: One British pound equals National Currency Yuan; the rest are National Currency hundred yuan equals the number of US dollars, marks, francs, Hong Kong dollars, and Japanese yen. The solid line in the chart is the shadow market price after March of this year, and the dashed line is the central bank's listed price.</p>

<h3>A Discussion on Calligraphy in Primary and Secondary Schools</h3>
<p>— Huang Ruozhou</p>
<p>The writing of every language has two forms, printing and handwriting. Our country's handwriting generally uses the regular script. However, the so-called regular script, although simpler than the original ancient script, seal script, and official script, is still not simple enough. Recently, whether it is the writing of literati, the notes of scholars, the accounting of merchants, or all kinds of applied documents of the masses, they generally use cursive script, simplifying various methods as handwriting, which can increase efficiency by three times. This shows that our country's handwriting style is no longer sufficient for regular script application.</p>
<p>Our country's writing has evolved from Guzhou to Small Seal Script, from Official Script to Cursive, Standard, and Running Script. The traces of its evolution are clearly visible. One type of cursive script, called Modern Cursive, mostly uses turning movements to replace the complicated strokes of regular script, and the brushstrokes are rounded and linked, which is quite suitable for writing. However, the current cursive script, running script, and simplified script have no standards, and both writers and readers feel inconvenienced because identification is difficult and many errors occur.</p>
<p>According to the curriculum standards promulgated by the Ministry, the intermediate grade of primary school should be familiar with the commonly used running and cursive simplified characters, and the senior grade should practice writing these characters. However, due to the lack of copying models and the lack of teaching methods, no one has complied with them, so that scholars need to copy and pick up things from east to west in the future, and develop today's neither donkey nor horse characters. If we follow the old ways and spread errors, we will not know where to end. This is the crisis of our country's writing. Recently, the Ministry of Education has seen that the local culture is gradually declining and has issued an order to primary and secondary schools across the country to focus on practicing calligraphy. Primary school graduates should be able to write regular script and commonly used semi-cursive script, and junior and senior high schools should focus on regular script and running cursive script, all mainly written with a brush. I believe that the regular script is common throughout the country and is always unanimous, and there is often no objection, but the running and cursive script has never had a style. All the running and cursive script calligraphy books of past dynasties have no fixed method, and often one character has several methods, and one method has several uses, making learning even more difficult. Therefore, it is suitable for appreciation, but it is not suitable for practical use. With this in mind, the reporter has selected a common book to supplement the deficiencies of regular script and use it as a handwriting style for standardization and facilitating circulation. The selected characters are the more common, recognizable, and easy-to-write characters in cursive, running, and simplified scripts. There is absolutely no reform of the characters, creating new styles from oneself. The author adheres to the principle of narrating but not creating, and there is no conflict with the inherent culture and the customary habits, so it is extremely convenient and easy to carry out. In this way, calligraphy in primary and secondary schools takes regular script as the foundation and running cursive script as the application, so that learning has a foundation, and the purpose of universal application is achieved, and the right track of learning calligraphy can be followed. Because there has been no method for teaching running cursive script, beginners feel it is difficult to get started. The reporter does not mind seeking details and has deeply researched and systematically reorganized cursive, running, and simplified calligraphy, so that scholars can understand the way. The compilation is generally based on regular script as the outline and is classified according to the Ci Yuan radicals. There are also characters that are easy to write but not easy to recognize, have a long history of circulation, and are widely used and indelible, such as "寿" (longevity), "者" (person), "尔" (you), etc. A separate character root is compiled, still based on the stroke number of the regular character as the determinant sequence. Under each radical and character root, the methods of forming the top, left, middle, right, and bottom are listed to achieve the effect of learning one thing and understanding three. However, this is a major matter, and I hope that the people of Hongda in the sea will further teach it, which would be fortunate.</p>

<h3>West Youth Basketball League: Ineffective Chase in the Second Half: Moore Loses to Hwa Lien; Chih Chih Also Loses to Mai Ling Hung; Tonight Paramount Plays Xu Fang</h3>
<p>There were originally three matches in the West Youth Basketball League last night, but the first match between Zhen Dan and Mai Ling Jin was postponed for some reason, so only two matches were played. The match between Mai Ling Hung and Chih Chih took place first. Mai Ling Hung's momentum was strong, and Chih Chih was also well-organized, but ultimately, because Mai Ling's players were tall and strong, Chih Chih was 18 to 24 behind by six points in the first half. In the second half, Chih Chih tried hard to catch up, but because Mai Ling Hung's defense was tight, Chih Chih lost to Mai Ling Hung 38 to 47. In the final game, Hwa Lien played Moore. Hwa Lien's momentum was very high in the first half. After Sun Huipei opened the scoring, they were leading by a long way with 8 to 1 and 10 to 4. At the end of the first half, Hwa Lien was 15 and Moore was 7 points. After switching sides and fighting again, Moore's Ling Peng was very active. After 13 to 20, Xuan Hegao and Ling Peng scored three consecutive goals, chasing to 19 to 20, only one point behind. However, the good times did not last long. Hwa Lien's Shen Yugong and Sun Huipei's penalty shots were consecutive and accurate. Although Moore's Yu Tianqing pulled back a goal, it was still a drop in the bucket. When the whistle sounded, Hwa Lien defeated Moore 33 to 23.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Holds Sino-Western Charity Track and Field Meet; South China Athletic Association Wins Both Men's and Women's Championships</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong Correspondence) The Sino-Western charity track and field meet, held to aid refugees, took place on the 24th and 25th of this month (that is, last Christmas) at the South China Athletic Association's stadium in Causeway Bay. Over 140 participants, representing various Chinese and Western organizations and individual athletes, competed in over 20 events. It was the grandest track and field meet on Hong Kong Island. Ticket sales totaled over HK$470. The South China Athletic Association swept both the men's and women's championships. The men's runner-up was Pui Ching Middle School, and the women's runner-up was Guangzhou University. While the track event results were not particularly outstanding, Tyler of the Hong Kong Police Force broke the Chinese national record in the discus throw, with a distance of 38.41 meters (the previous Chinese national record was 37.85 meters), adding considerable excitement to the event. In addition to track and field, there was also a gymnastic performance by the Overseas Chinese Middle School, which was well-received.</p>
<p>School Overview</p>
<h3>Zhengxing Girls' Middle School</h3>
<p>The private Zhengxing Girls' Middle School, founded in the autumn of the twelfth year of the Republic, has now been in existence for five years. There have been several changes in personnel. In the twenty-third year, it was renamed Zhengxing Vocational Girls' Middle School. In July of the same year, the word "Vocational" was removed, and its registration was approved. The school was initially located on Seymour Road, near Jing'an Temple Road, and later moved to Avenue Lafayette, near Route Cardinal Mercier. In March of the twenty-fifth year, it moved to 162 Avenue Foch. The initial chairman of the board was Shen Junru, who was later succeeded by Chu [omitted character]. The principals have been Huang Daping from the twenty-second year to February of the twenty-fifth year, and Shen Junru from March of the twenty-fifth year to the twenty-seventh year. After August 13th, the renowned lawyer Shi Youfu took over. The student body has grown from over one hundred to over four hundred and thirty students, and the number of classes has expanded from six to eleven. After five years of effort, the school has now taken on a preliminary scale. The internal organization is currently divided into three departments: Secretariat, Instruction, and General Affairs. Each department has a director. Guo Xiuyan serves as both Secretary and Director of Instruction, Xu Jinan as Deputy Director of Instruction, and Shen Yue as Director of General Affairs. The curriculum for junior high school is undivided. For senior high school it is divided into General and Commercial. Teachers include Zhu Tianfan, Ze Sheng, Qian Boxian, and Zhu Shumei for Chinese Language; Wang Gong'an, Wang Dexun, Chen Liangyi, and Yang Zhongyun for Mathematics and Science; Lü Jingmei and Lu Zhuang for English; Huang Jueren and Chen Fengzhu for Social Sciences; Fan Beisan and Wang Shanzhang for Natural Sciences; and Gu Pinyu and Wang Rui for Commercial subjects. The internal facilities have been gradually added and improved over the years, and have not been affected by the war, so they can be described as substantial. Furthermore, in view of the heavy burden on parents during the national crisis, the tuition and miscellaneous fees charged are particularly low, and there are free tuition quotas for each grade, so there are also a disproportionately large number of students from impoverished families studying at the school. An affiliated elementary school is attached. It currently has over five hundred students. The middle and elementary schools together have over forty faculty and staff members, and over one thousand students.</p>

<h3>The Division Between Civilization and Barbarism</h3>
<p>— Bai Ying</p>
<p>According to the boasting of a Japanese soldier, the level of knowledge of Japanese soldiers is far higher than that of Chinese soldiers. As a result, a "rear area" writer immediately wrote an article, asserting that China is a barbaric country with a low level of culture, and citing the words of a famous person, saying that great generals have never come from among barbarians, but from among cultured people.</p>
<p>Then, in order to show his "writer's" "impartial" attitude, he also said that we cannot deny the strength of wildness and prove the strengths of civilized people. Because in ancient history, there were many civilized countries that were conquered or threatened by barbarians. For example, ancient Persia, with a high level of civilization, was often invaded by barbarians. The Central Plains cultural area of China was often disturbed by Yi and Di tribes, and even conquered several times. Moreover, he concluded that the attempt of the proletariat to "conquer" the bourgeoisie is nothing more than the delusion of a victory of wildness with a lower cultural level.</p>
<p>However, the final victory in the battle between barbarism and civilization will inevitably still belong to civilization, even this "rear area" writer admitted. It is said that the struggle between ancient Sparta and Athens is the best example. Because although Sparta's military strength was strong for a time, Sparta ultimately perished, while the civilization of Athens still survives in the world today.</p>
<p>If today's Japan is the "civilized" Athens, and China is the "barbaric" Sparta, I don't know if this "writer" has the courage to admit it? Although he wanted to slap others in the face when he picked up his pen, he ended up slapping himself in the face every time!</p>
<p>Aggression is a barbaric act, even Hitler and Mussolini said so. Our "rear area" writer, as a supporter of the Berlin-Rome axis, naturally does not dare to innovate. In fact, a truth that has long been universally recognized cannot be denied no matter how cunning you are. However, the ambitions of aggressors will never stop their acts of aggression simply because such a truth exists. Therefore, one has no choice but to misattribute and switch the rifles around, insisting that the aggressor is the aggressed and that the aggressed is the aggressor. Although this strategy of reversing right and wrong is extremely weak, because it is "barbaric," they can no longer think of a "civilized" strategy.</p>
<p>To still be arguing today about who is the aggressor between China and Japan is simply an idiot talking nonsense. The League of Nations, gathering civilized countries from around the world, has already determined for us who the aggressor is, and world opinion has long unanimously exposed the true face of the aggressor. However, because "barbaric" weapons are still in the hands of the aggressor, although the theorem of right and wrong is clear, we still have to prove the truth of this theorem with our own blood and flesh.</p>
<p>From the perspective of common sense knowledge, perhaps the military technical knowledge of Japanese soldiers is stronger than that of Chinese soldiers. This is because Japan has this military technical equipment. If China also had this high level of technical equipment, then the knowledge of Chinese soldiers in this area would certainly not be inferior to that of Japan. As for the knowledge from the perspective of truth, the "cultural" nature of Japanese soldiers is most clearly demonstrated in the Nanjing Massacre and other atrocities. Taking another look at one of Amelets Veapa's Japanese spies (now published in "Translation Report"), one can better understand how much difference there is between the "cultural nature" in the mouths of Japanese soldiers and the "bestiality" of barbarians.</p>
<p>Great generals come from among cultured people, which is correct, as exemplified by China's supreme commander and his subordinates. As for Japan, the frequent changes of commanders in the sixteen months of the Sino-Japanese War (and now another major reshuffle) show their fluster, and the ugliness of the so-called "great generals" has been completely exposed. A schemer like Doihara is the epitome of a Japanese "great general"—cruel, tyrannical, ruthless, lacking in reason. All of this is the intellect of Japanese soldiers!</p>
<p>The division between civilization and barbarism of a nation is determined by the nation's sense of justice and its practice. This explanation also applies to the division between civilization and barbarism in the Sino-Japanese War. All distortions and cover-ups will not escape the demon-revealing mirror of truth.</p>
<h3>Flight</h3>
<p>— Ji Han</p>
<p>This place is not a street, nor is it considered a lane, and it's even less of a road. It's just a mud path between two shacks, so let's call it a mud path.</p>
<p>The residents here don't use terms like "master," "madam," "miss," or "young master." But recently, someone new came, and everyone calls him "Mr." His surname is Bao. Counting from Little Sanzi, Little Liuzi, and so on, they call him Little Bao Mr.</p>
<p>Little Bao Mr. is only in his twenties, with a fair face, a high nose, and a receding hairline combed back. He wears a long gown and walks with a dignified air, but he is very kind to people.</p>
<p>Normally, for someone like Little Bao Mr. to appear in a shack would be quite a miracle. Now, everyone assumes he escaped from the war zone and is staying temporarily. Everyone knows he will eventually fly away like a bird.</p>
<p>But before he flies away, he always sits in front of the shack reading the "News" newspaper, especially on good weather mornings.</p>
<p>"Ah, Little Bao Mr. knows how to read?"</p>
<p>"Tch, how could he read the newspaper if he didn't know how to read!"</p>
<p>The person who was scolded walked away with a red face.</p>
<p>Little Bao Mr. laughed when he heard it, his eyes shifting to the one who said "Tch" to the other, nodding at him:</p>
<p>"Good morning!"</p>
<p>"Oh, oh, Little Bao Mr., good morning to you!"</p>
<p>"What's your name?"</p>
<p>"My name is Ronggui." He wrung his hands as if he didn't know where to put them. "My mom calls me Little Guier."</p>
<p>"Haha, great, great!"</p>
<p>This laugh made Little Guier happy, and he moved closer, also peering at the newspaper. Little Bao Mr. knew he was looking at the black man in the Darkie toothpaste advertisement. Looking at Little Guier, apart from his yellow teeth, his face did resemble him.</p>
<p>"Guier brother, how old are you this year?"</p>
<p>"Nineteen!"</p>
<p>"Have you studied?"</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>Little Bao Mr. knew this question was unnecessary.</p>
<p>"Have you always lived here?"</p>
<p>"No, last year I lived in Zhabei."</p>
<p>"How many people are in your family?"</p>
<p>"Dad, Mom, me, three. I used to have an older sister, but later..." His eyes reddened, and he couldn't continue.</p>
<p>"Later! What happened?"</p>
<p>"Later in Zhabei she was ××..." He hesitated, "was ×× killed!" He explained, with an angry look on his face.</p>
<p>Little Bao Mr. understood and didn't pursue it, changing the subject and talking to him about unimportant things and the news in the newspaper. He waited until his mother called him before he left.</p>
<p>From that day on, Little Guier and Little Bao Mr. became friends, always chatting when they had nothing to do. Other young men, not much different from Little Guier, all flocked around, and Little Bao Mr. talked and asked questions as usual.</p>
<p>In the morning and evening, there would be crowds of people on this mud path, listening to Little Bao Mr.'s talk: the news in the newspaper, and his own opinions. Whenever there were news related to ××, he always talked about it vividly. Undoubtedly, the hearts of these resilient young men were gradually warming up and becoming inflamed.</p>
<p>Finally, on a dark night, when Little Bao Mr. believed the time was ripe, he quietly led more than a dozen enthusiastic young soldiers, leaving this narrow mud path, and flying to their vast journey, to do that great work.</p>

<p>— Yang Kuanzheng</p>
<p>The book "A Record of the Massacre in Jiading," originally named "Dongtang Diary," also known as "Jia Ding Yi You Ji Lue," is a book that records and describes how the people of Jiading resisted during the late Ming Dynasty! The author, Mr. Zhu Zisu, personally experienced it, and what he recorded is of course a very personal fact. At the end of the Ming Dynasty, Wu Sangui led the Qing troops south, and Han traitors surrendered one after another. After Yangzhou was broken, the people who were still defending and resisting were Jiayin, Kunshan, Jiading, Songjiang, and Jinshanwei. The resistance in Yangzhou, Jiading and Jiangyin was the most enthusiastic and tragic, and the massacres were the most severe. There was even such a popular saying at the time as "Suffering is worse than Jiading, and tragedy is worse than Jiangyin!" The tragic situation at that time can be imagined!</p>
<p>"Dongtang Diary" is a real record of the time, and is a first-class reportage of national consciousness. The author, Mr. Zhu Zisu, named Jiu Chu, was a student of the Yi Xiang. He abandoned the post of the Ministry of Rites in Jiashen, and retired to teach. He was of course a man of integrity. He also compiled Records of the Remaining People of the Past Dynasties, and Sad and Loyal Records of Wu Lue, etc., which are all rich in national consciousness. Mr. Zhu's work depicting the resistance of the people of Jiading is of course also rich in national consciousness. As far as I know, there are currently six publications of this book:</p>
<p>Jingtuo Yishi Edition</p>
<p>Mingji Baishi Edition</p>
<p>Record Compilation Edition</p>
<p>Shenbao Hall Lithographic Edition</p>
<p>China's Internal Disorder and External Calamity Series Edition</p>
<p>Jiaqing Jiazi Huitang Zhu Chunsheng Manuscript Copy</p>
<p>The Zhu Chunsheng manuscript copy is signed with the original name "Dongtang Diary," with a brief introduction by Zhu Jiuchu in the front and a postscript by Zhu Chunsheng on the 23rd night of the first month of Jiazi at the back. It is now in the collection of Zhou Chengzhong of Jiading, and was once printed and distributed. The original was displayed at the Shanghai Literature Exhibition held at the former Shanghai Museum. Comparing this version with the previous publications, it is known that the previous publications have been altered by people of the Qing Dynasty, and have lost their original appearance! But this manuscript copy is Mr. Zhu Zisu's original manuscript.</p>
<p>This manuscript copy calls the people's "righteous army" "our army," and the "Qing soldiers" "northern soldiers." All the newly appointed dignitaries of the Qing court are also referred to as "northern" without the prefix "Qing." However, many publications call them "Great Qing" "Qing soldiers," and also call "Prince Yu" "Grand Marshal of the Qing Troops," which is of course not the work of Mr. Zhu Zisu, who had a national consciousness. This manuscript copy criticizes the then magistrate of Jiading, saying that Magistrate Qian Mo "was not interested in his official position, and the people had no laws and disciplines," but the publications have deleted this! As evidence, "Tizhai Jianwen Lu" by Su Rong of Jiading also says:</p>
<p>"The new magistrate of Jiading is Qian Mo from Jiashan, Zhejiang, who was selected from the south. His name is Mo, and he was a Jinshi in the same list as the former magistrate Cao. In the court, he became a family disciple. He was known for his youth and his reputation, and when he was in politics, he was dedicated to abolishing [illegible], and the people were mostly resentful!"</p>
<p>At that time, the magistrate Qian Mo was indeed a playboy who exploited the people, but the publications deleted his crimes and hid his sins!</p>
<p>This manuscript copy says that there was a man named Jiang Ruolai at that time, who was truly a loyal and virtuous man, saying, "When the northern soldiers entered Nandou, Ruolai escaped and returned, killed his wife and children, and went to the sea to rely on King Yiyang." How virtuous it was for him to kill his wife and children and escape into the sea! However, the publications call Ruolai "a rascal in the market, who met by chance with [illegible] strength, and was promoted to Dudou. When he heard that Weiyang had fallen, he abandoned his post and fled back," turning Ruolai into a derelict rascal! This manuscript copy says that Ruolai "looked at the dozens of copper cannons in the warehouse, and had people carry them with him as he left, and then entered the sea through the Xu family line." He carried away the heavy weapons stored in Jiading to avoid aiding the enemy. This was the most necessary thing to do during the retreat! But the publications changed it again, saying that Ruolai "[illegible], leaving only tens of thousands of copper coins, [illegible] as he left, he plundered the Xu family line, leaving nothing behind, and the cries of the poor people shook the sky." Jiang Ruolai became a bandit! The Qing people's ability to change [illegible] is really clever, changing "dozens of copper cannons" into tens of thousands of copper coins, and changing "then entered the sea through the Xu family line" into "plundered the Xu family line." It was not enough to say it so badly, so they added the sentences "leaving nothing behind, and the cries of the poor people shook the sky!"</p>
<p>Also, when the righteous soldiers of Waigang Loutang fought a great battle with Liang Desheng, and the righteous soldiers won a great victory, this manuscript copy described it in great detail and vividly—</p>
<p>"At that time, our army was on the verge of collapse, but the Waigang Loutang soldiers engaged in fierce fighting. Niansandu has always been known as a den of thieves, and its people are quick and courageous. They killed the most, and after a few hours, the village soldiers gathered together, competing to burn (Liang) Desheng's ship. (Li) Chengdong took the fine gold and beautiful pearls, famous swords and precious knives that he had obtained from Weiyang, Jinling, Biling, and Jingkou, and put them all to the torch. Those that had not been destroyed were all plundered by the village soldiers. The ship was full of women, who were burned very miserably. Among them, there was a very beautiful woman who called out: "I am the daughter of a Hanlin official, and my home is in Yangzhou. I was taken here by force. Please save me!" The village soldiers all said, "You can jump into the water!" The woman cried and said, "My feet are chained and I can't escape!" Before she could finish speaking, the raging fire burned her body! The smoke and flames covered the sky, and the red light shone for more than ten miles. It did not extinguish until dawn. Desheng fled east in the night, barely managing to arrive."</p>
<p>How brave and resourceful was the ambush and fire attack of the righteous soldiers at this time! The customs of the people in the Waigang area are still very strong today. The bandits in peacetime will stand up and become heroes of righteousness when the great era comes. This is the same in ancient and modern times! The publications that had been altered by the Qing people only had a few words, saying: "At dawn, several of Desheng's soldiers' heads were counted, totaling eighty-four. The rest of Desheng's troops fled east, barely managing to arrive."</p>
<p>In the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, the Qing people wantonly altered this type of work that displayed the national consciousness, playing around with black and white. This "Record of the Massacre in Jiading" is another example.</p>
<p>(Note) The "Jiading County Yiyou Chronicles" in "Painful History" published by the Commercial Press in the first and second years of the Republic of China was based on Zhu Chunsheng's manuscript copy. "Painful History" is now out of print. I and my friends have been searching for two or three years. Two months ago, Zhao Jingshen found it in Laiqingge. It is now included in the "Biography of Jiading Righteous People" published by the World Book Bureau to spread it widely. Editor</p>

<h3>A Traveler on a Journey</h3>
<p>— Ai Ding</p>
<p>The last glow of the setting sun,</p>
<p>Sinks on the treetops of the forest.</p>
<p>The traveler eagerly hopes:</p>
<p>That the sunlight does not fall.</p>
<p>He still has to travel a stretch of the road.</p>
<p>The horizon drowns out the setting sun,</p>
<p>And the golden light of the gossamer is also withdrawn.</p>
<p>He still moves forward,</p>
<p>Wanting to drag back the sunlight's illumination,</p>
<p>To let him travel another section.</p>
<p>Groping forward in the twilight,</p>
<p>Thorns break his feet.</p>
<p>Reeds sting his hand,</p>
<p>Go, go,</p>
<p>Not afraid of difficulty, only of doing.</p>
<p>Across the river flickers a bright lamp,</p>
<p>Surrounded by a warm countryside.</p>
<p>He wants to get over there,</p>
<p>Although in front of him is a river,</p>
<p>And behind him is a mountain!</p>

<h3>New Year and New Clothes</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhenshan</p>
<p>The progression of time is like a running train, quickly carrying the New Year once again. Welcoming the New Year with joy and happiness, and watching everything prepare for a fresh start, the surging inner self has an indescribable feeling of pleasure, excitement, good fortune, and pride! Those who have been striving and toiling all year round will use entertainment to wash away the year's fatigue and exhaustion, and at the same time, they will inevitably make new expressions in their private lives.</p>
<p>No matter what class of people they are, the most obvious activity in the New Year is changing into new clothes. Even if they are poor scholars, or shabby young men, they must change into a relatively clean outfit. Speaking in a boastful tone on the surface seems somewhat vulgar, but in fact, wearing new clothes in the New Year not only serves as a festive embellishment, but also implies many profound meanings: it represents a fresh start and the renewal of all things, it symbolizes increasing joy and happiness, it has the power to encourage people to make new efforts and progress, and it has the advantage of regulating a depressed spirit.</p>
<p>Therefore, wearing new clothes in the New Year is not unique to Shanghai, not unique to China, and in fact, every nation in the world has this custom and habit. It seems to be an innate sense and action. At this time, even those who don't like to dress up will naturally dress up. The wealthiest millionaires, wives, misses, and young masters wear brand-new, noble clothes. The less wealthy will wear slightly lower-quality new clothes, and the even less wealthy will wear cheaper new clothes. Although the division of materials is based on economic environment, the meaning is the same.</p>
<h3>Tofu and Tofu Milk</h3>
<p>— Shuangxi Yiye</p>
<p>"Speaking of winter, I suddenly thought of tofu. It's a 'small saucepan' (aluminum pot) of boiled tofu, steaming hot. The water is boiling, like many fish eyes. Small pieces of tofu are kept inside, tender and slippery, as if wearing a white fox fur coat inside out. --- Father said it was cold at night, and eating it would warm everyone up. We all liked this plain boiled tofu..."</p>
<p>The above passage is what the literary researcher Mr. Zhu Ziqing tells us in his essay titled "Winter."</p>
<p>Tofu! Tofu! People all over the world like to eat tofu, but they don't know why tofu is tofu.</p>
<p>According to a food nutrition researcher, the soybeans used to make tofu contain the most protein, and also contain many other nutrients needed by the human body. It can be seen that all the conditions for a food to be complete can be obtained from tofu. If we use more modern terms, then vitamins A, B, C... all the way to X or N (although some have not yet been discovered) are all contained in it. It is truly a "background player" among tonics! Other tonics only have vitamin C but not A, or only have A but lack B; there are many omissions, which are not comparable to tofu. Why must Zhu Ziqing write about tofu when he eats tofu? It's because he has to write it; there is probably a good reason.</p>
<p>Tofu's "friend for life" is tofu milk. In terms of experience, tofu is of course more experienced, but in terms of quality, tofu milk must be considered first.</p>
<p>Tofu can be old or tender, while tofu milk is a flowing body that is so tender that it cannot be any tenderer. It can be said that it is a small family jade who has not yet left the "pot" [?]. Its pleasantness and its ability to benefit people's vitality cannot be described in a few words.</p>
<p>As for its low price, the convenience of using it, and the ease of digestion, these are especially the case. It is truly the supreme tonic for the public in winter.</p>
<h3>The Story of Gift-Giving</h3>
<p>— Books</p>
<p>Speaking of gift-giving, it's truly a difficult problem! Often, someone spends a great deal of money, thinking they've found an extremely satisfactory and precious item, but the result is that the recipient doesn't even glance at it with proper eyes, isn't that strange? Let me give you an example: In the past, Mr. Kraner, a British man who was the Chief Traffic Superintendent of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, loved to smoke cigars. What wasn't needed along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway? What wasn't contracted out to merchants? When the New Year season arrived, which merchant wouldn't plan for their business in the coming year by flattering him—presenting a generous winter solstice gift? My friend, Mr. Sun, contracted for yellow sand and gravel. At first, every year he bought very expensive cigars to give to Mr. Kraner, who would always laugh and accept them, perhaps saying "Thank you." Once, when the gift was delivered a little late, Mr. Kraner happened not to be home. A servant was in the process of opening boxes of cigars. From the cigar boxes discarded to the side, Mr. Sun knew at a glance that they were all very precious imports, and his own brand was among them. "Why are they being thrown into baskets?" he wondered, and asked the servant. It turned out they were all winter solstice gifts from other people. Because Mr. Kraner didn't like smoking them himself, he soaked them in a water tank, preparing to use them as fertilizer for the flowers and trees. He was even more puzzled and had to ask the servant again. Only then did he learn that the cigars Mr. Kraner smoked were managed by only one foreign firm in Shanghai, and only a very small number of famous people smoked them. If you didn't specify that you were buying them as a gift for one of these smokers, you couldn't possibly buy them. Mr. Sun received this unexpected news, quickly took the gift he had brought with great enthusiasm and left. He went personally to the Renji Foreign Firm, explained his intention, and indeed, he achieved his goal this time. He rushed to Mr. Kraner's house that very night to give them to him. When Mr. Kraner saw that he was being given exactly what he loved, he immediately smiled brightly, extended his hand, and shook it tightly, repeatedly saying, "Thank you! Thank you for your kindness!" Mr. Sun's joy was truly extraordinary. From then on, everything went smoothly. Until Mr. Kraner left his post, his contract for yellow sand and gravel never suffered any unexpected problems, all thanks to this small box of cigars!</p>
<p>The thread in the young lady's hand, the clothes on the healthy son.</p>
<p>Corrigendum: In the article "Face Painting in Peking Opera," published on January 2nd, there was a slight error in the text. In the fourteenth line, the word "後 (hou, back)" in "...片子往後貼一些 (the hairpieces should be pasted a bit back)..." should be "前 (qian, front)." Also, the following was omitted: "...反之，瘦的臉就可以把這些兩鬢的片子貼後一些 (conversely, for thin faces, these hairpieces on the temples can be pasted further back)...." We hereby correct this.</p>
<h3>A Weekly Economical Menu</h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>I'm very ashamed! In this season of renewal, I have no good dishes to offer to my dear readers. Chicken is what I desire; duck is also what I desire; but after flipping through my menu, I can't seem to find them as if they were treasures. Again and again, it's all for the sake of economy. I've been reading this newspaper these past few days and have seen the advertisements for the Quansheng electric cooker in restaurants, which can't help but make my appetite stir. However, including it in home-style cooking is not economically feasible; moreover, probably not many homes have an electric cooker. Now, to satisfy our cravings, let's make a Ten-Ingredient Small Hot Pot. Take beef slices, shredded onions, chicken or duck gizzards, vermicelli, tofu, and tatsoi or spinach, etc., add soy sauce and lard, braise until thoroughly cooked, then put them in a small tin pot and place it on a small stove to heat and eat. It's even more flavorful than eating Quansheng, and even the Japanese-style "Sukiyaki" can't compare. If you, dear readers, have a poor appetite, why not give it a try?</p>

<h3>Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation in Chengdu</h3>
<p>— Xu Eryin</p>
<p>In Guangdong and Guangxi, all we see is short clothing, it's rare for anyone to wear long robes; but in Chengdu, all we see are long robes, it's rare to wear short clothing, the exact opposite. Chengdu also has a fashion for mandarin jackets, and not only older and middle-aged people wear them, but young people can't do without them either. One of my classmates used to wear suits and hats in Shanghai, but after returning to Chengdu for four years, he wears silk robes, black mandarin jackets, and a melon-shaped skullcap. Civil servants naturally wear Zhongshan suits, but because most civil servants are somewhat hunchbacked, and can never puff out their chests, they still can't look energetic wearing Zhongshan suits. Students naturally all wear gray ramie student uniforms, but students in Sichuan often go to teahouses, open the buttons on their necks, put their belts on the tea table, and recline in bamboo chairs as if they're sitting but not sitting, sleeping but not sleeping. In this way, they are even less presentable than the remnants of the long-robe and mandarin-jacket era.</p>
<p>Women's clothing, however, is the same as everywhere else, you can see everything from ancient times to Westernized styles.</p>
<p>On the street, what especially attracts the attention of newcomers are the lamas, in their dark red robes. The clothing of ordinary Hui people is exactly the same as ours, as are their food, housing, and transportation.</p>
<p>Food Speaking of the food of Chengdu, it's truly inexhaustible. Sichuan cuisine is famous, needless to say; but what's even more unforgettable are the many snacks that can only be tasted in Chengdu.</p>
<p>On my first night in Chengdu, I was invited by my classmates to a snack shop with "Wu Chaoshou" written on the sign. I thought to myself, it's probably named after an outstanding chef named Wu. I heard my classmates call out "Two orders of chaoshou," and only then did I realize that chaoshou is a type of food. I asked my classmates, and they told me that chaoshou is wonton, the same as wonton in Cantonese restaurants. Besides Wu Chaoshou, there's also Dwarf Chaoshou Ye Degui, both are clean, but their small storefronts are always packed. Naturally, their reputations are well-deserved, a small bowl is enough to make you ask for more. The taste is indescribable. In short, all the snacks in Chengdu have several common advantages: one is that they're cheap, two is that they're delicious, and three is that they don't fill you up.</p>
<p>The dumplings in Lychee Lane unfortunately must have a large amount of "red oil" added, if you can't eat spicy food, the deliciousness will be driven away by the spiciness.</p>
<p>An order of steamed dumplings has ten, only equivalent to one or two elsewhere, not too many to put all in your mouth. The glutinous rice balls and 24 Spring are the best of their kind.</p>
<p>In short, Chengdu is an antique and decadent city, Chengdu has "decadent snacks" that don't harm the spleen and stomach, as Mr. Zhou Zuoren said. It's a pity that Mr. Zhou didn't realize there's such a good place outside of Beijing.</p>
<p>Housing Naturally, Chengdu also has slums, which are outside the city and far away.</p>
<p>Inside the city, it's completely different. Westernized are the shops on Chunxi Road commercial field, those with ancient styles are the mansions in the residential area of Shao City.</p>
<p>Whether large, medium, or small, mansions always have, first, a very presentable gatehouse, second, a red lantern hanging at the entrance, and third, a white-haired gatekeeper sitting between the outer and inner gates. This gatekeeper may be half-paralyzed, or may be blind in both eyes, and nine out of ten love to doze off, so people entering and exiting are not blocked every time. It is said that this is merely to "make the mansion look like a mansion."</p>
<p>Entering the inner gate, you can see one or two withered trees, three or four slender bamboos, five or six pots of chrysanthemums, then, a spacious living room, a lifeless courtyard.</p>
<p>The way people live in Chengdu is probably the same as their transportation, maintaining a full official style.</p>
<p>Transportation People in Chengdu rarely go out. Chengdu is nine and three-tenths of a mile square, they say they live their whole lives within these nine and three-tenths of a mile. Going out beyond Niushi Kou is a big deal, going to Shanghai is called studying abroad, and they can receive overseas study expenses in the provincial government. After returning from studying abroad, they all compete for jobs, whatever they learned outside is not questioned.</p>
<p>But people in Chengdu still don't like to move. They can't bear to leave the comfortable, leisurely Chengdu.</p>
<p>People in Chengdu walk on the street, mostly without anything to do, maybe they just came out of a teahouse, maybe they're going to some "De Yi Lou," "Gu He Yuan," "Bu Ru Gui" to sip tea. They always walk very slowly, so even rickshaws can only go slowly, because the sidewalk and the road are not separate, except when important people are passing through, and the middle of the road also has leisurely strollers.</p>
<p>There are few cars in Chengdu, and many rickshaws, which are cheap, almost the most in the country. There are horses, mules, public vehicles, sedan chairs, bamboo carriers, wooden boats, and wood-fueled road vehicles. The roads of Shu are not difficult, the difficulty lies in the lack of modern means of transportation, but it's still passable.</p>

<p>Arts and Entertainment</p>
<h3>A Brief Discussion of Acrobatics</h3>
<p>— Limei</p>
<p>"Jianghu" skills, there are many kinds, using either tools or animals, generally called acrobatics, also called mixed plays. Examining its origins, it has been around for a long time. The History of the Later Han Dynasty mentions stopping fish-dragon acrobatics; the History of the Tang Dynasty states that in September of the second year of the Baoli era, acrobatics were viewed at the Xuanhe Hall for three days and then stopped. So the name "acrobatics" existed in the Han Dynasty. The idea is that selling skills and presenting art became complete by the Han Dynasty, so even the emperor often enjoyed watching them. However, as the pear garden became more prosperous in later generations, this type of acrobatics gradually declined, and those who practiced it were mostly common and rude people, not worthy of elegance, so they were not valued by the world.</p>
<p>For those performing acrobatics with tools, in ancient times there were lifting tripods, walking on beams, swallowing knives, and treading on fire, etc.; what is popular today are large sets of magic tricks such as juggling bowls, hanging upside down, walking on ropes, swallowing swords, and eating iron balls, which often attract audiences. Juggling bowls, hanging upside down, and walking on ropes are mostly performed by women. Swallowing swords, eating iron balls, and catching knives with the gate are mostly performed by men. What the world calls "two and a half sets of magic" refers to the skills performed by these men. Generally, women's performances are characterized by agility, while men's performances are characterized by the control of vital energy.</p>
<p>As for performances using animals, they can be divided into monkey shows and horse shows. Monkey shows originated earliest, the Book of Rites and Music Records mentions that "disturbing the children" refers to monkeys, and that dancing refers to monkey shows. It turns out that playing monkeys for entertainment existed as early as the Spring and Autumn period. Monkey handlers teach monkeys to perform actions, guiding them with gongs and drums, making them wear hats, clothes, ride sheep, push carts, carry sedan chairs, etc., to entertain people. Horse shows also have ancient origins, the Discourses on Salt and Iron mentions horse shows fighting tigers; the Biography of Empress Zhen in the Records of the Three Kingdoms states that when the Empress was eight years old, there were people performing horse shows outside, and the family all went to the attic to watch, but the Empress alone did not go; it can be seen that the evolution of horse shows has a long history. Horse shows are more complex and elaborate than monkey shows, some dismount, grab the saddle with their hands and go up, which is called tingma (listening horse). Others hold the stirrups firmly and swing back and forth from behind, which is called tiaoma (jumping horse). Others leave the saddle, extend their right foot, hang on the horse's tail, put their left foot in the stirrup and hold the tail with their right hand, which is called xian'an (presenting the saddle). Others throw their feet to the ground, drag the horse backwards, pick up objects from the ground, and then jump back on the horse, which is called tuoma (dragging horse). These kinds of skills are very similar to the performances of Western circus troupes.</p>
<p>Performers of acrobatics sell their skills everywhere, often supplementing with monkey shows and horse shows to form a troupe, using them to decorate. These people mostly belong to the salt registration, and every year on the sixteenth day of the first month, they must gather at the ancient Ji Temple in the west of Yancheng County (sixty li from the city) for three days. Performers come to gather from as far north as Dalu and as far south as western Zhejiang, and the number of boats gathered is countless, at least several hundred. When the period is over, they scatter and return, so many families near the ancient Ji Temple also use acrobatics as a side business. The ancient Ji Temple is just a small village, with only over a hundred families in the surrounding area. When the children of acrobatic families are five or six years old, they are taught various skills, such as following flying feet and doing somersaults, etc., and when they grow up, they are taught other skills according to their gender. There are also those who raise adopted children and teach them skills, and when they grow up, they rely on them for a living.</p>
<p>Performers of acrobatics are not valued by the world, unlike the world-renowned Western circus troupes. I have tried to discuss this, and I deeply believe that there are several reasons for the decline of acrobatics in our country: first, weak capital, these people often use old and broken equipment, have narrow ambitions, and do not plan to improve. Second, outdated technology, mostly following their teachers, going out to perform, never thinking about research and improvement, and even less about using scientific technology. Third, the viewing methods need to be improved, after the audience pays to enter, the person in charge repeatedly asks for money, giving people a bad impression. Objectively speaking, this kind of acrobatics is most suitable for the entertainment tastes of our country's rural people; it is easy to hold a performance in a ten-acre field, sounding gongs, unlike city theaters which require a certain amount of construction costs. I hope that those who care about the entertainment of the masses will rise up and seek ways to improve it.</p>
<h3>A Groundbreaking Theatre Person: An Interview with Ms. Gu Han</h3>
<p>— Tieli</p>
<p>"Has Miss Gu Han always been in Shanghai?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Shanghai and I have known each other for quite some time, but this time, I haven't been in Shanghai for long." Her Mandarin was very crisp.</p>
<p>"Where has the lady been in the past?"</p>
<p>"In the past, I could really be considered a traveler of life." She smiled slightly, and didn't continue. Seeing that I was hoping to hear more, she continued, "Nanjing, Beijing, Fujian, Chengdu, Lianyungang, and places in Jiangnan and Jiangbei. Recently, it's not as convenient as before, and I've become one of those confined to a lone island."</p>
<p>"Since the lady has seen so much and has such rich life experience, participating in theatre and performing life is most suitable for the needs of the theatre movement. May I ask, what did the lady study in the past? Has she ever performed plays anywhere?"</p>
<p>"I'm very ashamed, although I've traveled to many places, I have no special skills. I love music the most, and I studied it in a specialized school. After I graduated from teacher's college, I performed operas on a large scale in Lianyungang. I've also tried several plays."</p>
<p>She is a girl with a very Eastern charm, her speech and manner are obviously generous and without a trace of affectation; she smiled again and said: "Life should be more serious, the so-called "modern" seems to lack the purpose of a good and beautiful life."</p>
<p>"I heard that Director Wu Cun believes that the lady is the most expressive out of hundreds and thousands of people. Why doesn't the lady want to be on the silver screen?"</p>
<p>"You're too kind! Where would I have such talent? There are many better ones! The bitter and spicy tastes of life have given me many deep impressions!" The lady was somewhat touched.</p>
<p>"What are the lady's thoughts on performing in the play 'Night of Joy'?"</p>
<p>"What thoughts could I have! You're overestimating me! But a person must always recognize their own position." This is a very philosophical answer. Miss Gu seems like a quiet daffodil, a lotus flower standing tall.</p>
<p>"What kind of roles does a lady like to play?" I asked. "I think I have to try them all, but I hate those who are absurd and unconscious."</p>
<p>"What kind of role is the lady playing now?" I asked again.</p>
<p>"Not so much. Those with more action are more difficult to play, and they are often not easy to please, that is to say, they are generally easily overlooked by the audience, but those who know the truth are not included." She said very solemnly.</p>
<p>"The lady is tired! The lady's efforts with a serious stance are a rare gain in the art world."</p>
<p>In the sound of "goodbye," I was left with an impression that was both rich in experience and lively and generous.</p>

<h3>Talking About Radio Plays (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Chen Dabei</p>
<p>It is true that the audience of radio plays willingly relegated themselves to the position of the blind, just as the audience of silent films in the past willingly relegated themselves to the position of the deaf. But many Shanghai friends who love to listen to a certain kind of local opera have told me that when they first heard that kind of opera on the radio, because they were familiar with the dialect, they found it indescribably beautiful; but when they saw the same group of actors performing on a stage at a grand gathering, they realized that they were a group of vulgar and unsightly "hooligans," and so they were not very willing to listen to their broadcasts anymore.</p>
<p>Yes, the beauty of the imagination that we evoke from hearing is a million times more beautiful than the beauty of the phenomena that we arouse from sight. Six years ago, I organized a radio drama group called the "Shanghai Guanyin Drama Society." In that society, there was a Tianjin lady whose voice was very round and beautiful, and whose tone was very rich in emotion and power. Her power was able to draw tears from her companions, causing everyone to sob and cry without end. She was also so smart that she could read new scripts that she had never seen before, and express every sentence and every word fully, expressing the emotions that the playwright hoped she would express, causing countless listeners to involuntarily write letters to praise her performance art. There were even many lustful youths who sent love letters, asking to meet her once. After she finished reading those boring letters, she always threw them into the stove or the letter basket, and never wrote back. But one night, after she finished broadcasting at the radio station, she suddenly burst into tears. After I repeatedly asked her, she showed me a signed love letter, which stipulated that she would meet at ten o'clock the next morning in the French Park, and if she disappointed him, he would immediately jump into the Huangpu River. She lost her mind and asked me to help her solve the problem of "saving a life is better than building a seven-story pagoda." This time, I persuaded her to go. After she went and came back, she cried even more. It turned out that the beautiful part of her was entirely in her intelligence and voice, but her posture and appearance were enough to make the youth who sent the love letter not say a word to her, bow deeply to her, and walk away. It is likely that he would no longer be willing to jump into the Huangpu River. (End)</p>
<p>The special feature of radio plays lies in this point, it can bring out the highest standard of beauty in your ideal - the beauty of Cui Yingying and Lin Daiyu... the beauty that no star or king can play</p>
<p>More on the production, performance, dubbing and other issues related to radio plays will be discussed later.</p>
<h3>"Working Women's Drama Troupe" to Perform "Women's Apartment"</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Professional Women's Club is organized by professional women in Shanghai. Since its opening, it has achieved remarkable results, and various entertainment departments have become more active. The drama group has recently developed into the "Working Women's Drama Troupe," and recently participated in the three-day joint performance of four groups raising funds for destitute refugees, receiving rave reviews and high praise. The troupe is now scheduled to perform the four-act play "Women's Apartment" on the fifteenth of this month (Sunday) at the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association, day and night. The director, Wu Mei, has a long history in the theatre movement, and everyone who pays attention to the production movement knows her. This time, she is using her experience to take on the role of director, and she is sure to be happy and competent, needless to say.</p>
<h3>New Year's Jokes</h3>
<p>In the feudal bureaucracy of the past, people loved to hear auspicious words, especially on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day. A servant named Gao Sheng worked at a certain mansion. This man was extremely mischievous, often making the master so angry that he wanted to die; but according to the rules of the bureaucracy, he could not fire anyone until the end of the year. Seeing that New Year's Eve was approaching, the master decided not to use him next year. Who knew that on the big day of New Year's Eve, everyone, high and low, was busy, and by the time they had finished worshiping the gods, they had already kowtowed to welcome the New Year. The master suddenly remembered that he wanted to fire Gao Sheng. Gao Sheng was a clever ghost, and as soon as he saw that the situation was not right, he ran to the master before the master could open his mouth, gave him a salute, and asked, "Master, will you still get promoted next year?" The master thought, this kid is really hateful, just after saying goodbye to the old year, on the side of the New Year, how can he say that the master will not be promoted next year, and quickly replied with a smile: "The master wants to get promoted, wants to get promoted." Gao Sheng turned his face away and said to his companions: "I, Gao Sheng, will work for another year." (Mu Yun)</p>
<h3>Secret History of the Imperial Court and Pear Garden in the Old Capital (6) (5)</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Once, someone said that a hobbyist sang opera and didn't understand "qi kou" (that is, taking a breath when singing), and often after three or two sentences, he would be exhausted and hoarse, and was booed off the stage. One day, he suddenly visited a brilliant teacher, and asked, "Is there any secret to taking a breath when singing?" His teacher replied, "Of course there is, but you have to remember clearly where to take a small breath and when to take a big breath, and that's it." He asked with difficulty, "I'll have to ask the teacher to teach me this." His teacher then recited the erhu interlude and asked him to sing Hong Yang Dong. "For the country..." Four sentences in Erhuang. As soon as he finished singing the three words "for the country," his teacher stared at him with two big eyes, as if shouting a command, and said, "Small breath!" Then he sang "that he can," and as soon as he finished singing the word "he," the teacher shouted again, "Half breath!" Then he sang "half a day of leisure," and the teacher shouted again, "Big breath!" He seemed to feel much less effort. Because his memory was not good, he was afraid of mixing up the places for the three kinds of breaths, so when the teacher shouted the command, he also recited it. Who knew that this had become his habit, and when he went on stage to sing opera again, as soon as he came on stage and sang "for the country," he also shouted, "Small breath!" After that, he kept shouting "half breath" and "big breath." At this time, the erhu player, the drummer, and those who watched the show were all confused and said that his singing method was neither in the style of the Zhang school nor the Tan school, and that it was probably the Yang school (insiders often call outsiders yangmao).</p>
<p>Also, one time, an old actor was singing "Dingjun Mountain," but the one playing Yan Yan had a lisp, and when Zhang He asked him to report his name, he pronounced Yan Yan as "Grandpa." When Huang Zhong heard this, he couldn't hold it in anymore, and he laughed so hard that he couldn't straighten up. Yan Yan quickly ran forward and pulled him, saying, "Get up and take an arrow!" Huang Zhong continued to lie on the stage laughing, saying, "Good grandson, grandpa really can't get up."</p>
