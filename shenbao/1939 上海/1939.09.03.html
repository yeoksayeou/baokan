<p>柏林　波蘭駐德大使李潑斯基、今晨離開此間、其他館員並未離去、（二日哈兀斯電）</p>
<h3>張伯倫對德警告　英國已準備一切　決履行保障義務　希特勒倘仍執迷不悟　戎首應由彼一人負之</h3>
<p>倫敦昨夜英相張伯倫在下院發表其爲人亟所盼望之言論、其最重要點爲宣布英法已照會德國如對波蘭而施之各種侵略行爲不卽停止、而波蘭境內之德軍不即撤退、則英法將以其所有武力、爲波蘭後援、如德國對此警吿之答復不能滿意、則駐德英大使將下旗返國、而吾人將以貫澈到底之決心、作吾人本來亟願避免之戰鬥云、首相又稱、義相墨索里尼努力斡旋和平、殊堪欽佩、此决慘刦之造成、希特勒實負全責、希氏毫不猶豫、爲饜滿其無意識之野心起見、陷世界於戰禍、英國對於德國人民無所怨懟、德國人民之唯一過失、在容許其自己受納粹政府之支配耳云、</p>
<p>下院人極擁擠、幾無虛席、旁聽席亦然、當首相與工黨領袖格林武入塲時、歡呼聲大作、首相旋卽起立致詞、全院肅然聽之、</p>
<p>首相劈頭卽曰、余於今夜不擬多言、茲已屆實行而非空言之時、十八個月前、余曾　祝使英國接受戰爭的可怖仲裁之責任、不加諸余肩、目前余恐余將不能避此責任矣、但關於余責任所在之情勢、未有明顯甚於今日者、余已用種種方法、使德政府明瞭苟必再訴諸武力如前所爲、則吾人唯有決計以武力反抗之耳、今一切文件旣已公布、吾人將聽取歷史之裁判、吾人自知此决慘刦之責任、唯一人負之、（衆歡呼）蓋希特勒不恤陷世界於慘禍、以期饜滿其無意識之野心（眾歡呼）云、</p>
<p>首相繼謂下院在進行談判時未要求政府發表情報、此種忍耐殊可感謝、今與德政府往來文件概予公布、觀此可知英國目的在促成在平等地位上德波間關於其爭點之討論、而成就保障波蘭獨立面獲國際擔保之解決、八月三十日發出之公文、載有一段可表明如德政府果稍有和平解決之意、則最後衝突、不難避免、英政府在此文中、完全承認立即發動討論之需要、並亦承認希特勒所抱兩國軍隊彼此對峙相距甚近之隱憂、故主張雙方應擔任在談判時期中、不得作軍事行動、英政府自信如德政府予以此種擔任、則英政府能向波蘭覓得同樣擔任、八月三十一日波蘭政府即予答復、謂準備在相互基礎上給予保設、在談判進行時、波蘭軍隊不侵犯德國邊界、惟德政府對此建議迄無答復、吾則今晨戰事何致發生云、</p>
<p>首相繼言及德方在侵犯波蘭前所發出之廣播內、有德收府在此種還境中、認其所提議者已遭拒絕一語、首相謂德政府之提議、並未由德國送交波蘭、德政府於八月二十九日尙謂擬繕具可爲彼等所接受之提議、以期解決爭點、如屬可能、將提交英政府以待波蘭談判者之蒞臨、吾人久待德方此項提議、而駐德英大使亦力促德外長里賓特　甫邀波蘭大使來見、俾授以德方提議轉致波蘭政府、乃德外長竟出言不遜、謂渠決不邀波蘭大使來見、但若波蘭大使自請相見、則情形不同云、觀此情形、似德國認波蘭爲不是、因其對於絕不知其內容之提議未與德國進行談判也、星期三夜德外長取出一長文、以德語高聲快讀之、英大使當然向之索一副本、但德外長答稱、波蘭代表未於夜半行抵柏林、故已嫌過晚矣云、以致德國提議之副本、吾人卒未得之、直至昨夜、始從柏林廣播中聞其內容、德國之所謂談判者、直謂波蘭代表一經要求、即當行抵柏林、而領取必須整個接受的耍求、其實適常途徑、在吾人觀之、爲此項提案應早已提交波蘭、許以考慮時間、而容其發表德方提議是吾破壞德國前所聲明尊重的重要利益之意見、波蘭大使咋夜會晤里賓特羅甫、吿以波蘭願依平等基礎從事談判、德國覆稱、德軍已於今日黎明越過邊界、嗣聞已轟炸各鎮矣、處此情勢中、僅有一種途徑可供吾人由之、（衆歡呼）駐德之英法大使今均奉命以下述公文送交德政府矣、</p>
<p>「今晨德總理向德國陸軍所發之宣言、明白表示彼將攻擊波蘭、英法政府頃接情報、表示德軍已越過波蘭邊界、現正從事進攻、英法政府處此情勢中、覺德政府之行動、巳造成下列狀態、即一種威脅波蘭獨立之對波蘭的武力侵略行爲是、英法政府爲完成其所給予波蘭之担保起見、不得不出而援助之、爰特奉吿閣下、苟非德政府予敝政府以滿意之保證、聲明德政府將中止對波蘭之侵略行動、準備立即由波蘭境內撤退其軍隊、敝政府將不作猶豫、履行其義務、」</p>
<p>首相續告下院曰、「茍德政府對此最後警告之答覆、不能使吾人滿意、則英大使已奉命向德政府領取其護照矣、余並非以為德政府似不致如此也、果如此、則吾人一切已有準備矣、」首相於是宜布英政府所取之一切防務準備業已公布、又曰「此際吾人必多回憶一九一四年、並以吾人現時地位與彼時相較、吾人今决究處何地位乎、則答曰、海陸空三軍均枕戈待命、各方面局勢之有利與可安心、遠勝一九一四年、今所見最可滿意之主要事件、厥爲募兵無庸作一般的呼籲、如二十五年前古靑納勳爵所發呼籲然」首相至是乃述及前途曰、「吾人現遭遇艱鉅之任務、允其因吾人會獲往時之經騐、故今次亟當儘力依有條不紊公正經濟的基礎、組織吾人之人力、故政府已即提出達此目的之法制、今將在下院提出議案、該案爲實事求是計、無殊擴張軍訓法、凡年在十八至四十一歲間之壯丁應盡服軍役、對於工業所需之人力、將設法使之免予微抽、」首相於是聲明墨索里尼在最近數日危機中、亦竭其所能、以謀和平解決、渠與政府均感滿意、（衆歡呼）</p>
<p>首相之結語曰、「今吾人唯有咬緊牙關、加入吾人所嘗竭力圖免之戰鬥、而具貫澈目的之決心、吾人將抱純潔之良心、且獲自治領與不列顚帝國之援助、全世界大部份之道德上的許可而加入戰鬥、德國人民苟非　聽自身受納粹政府之統治、則吾人與若輩並無齟齬、納粹政府長此存在、而進行其兩年來一貫之手段、則歐洲將無和平之可言、吾人決定此種手段必須終止、吾人若能因此戰鬥而在世界中重樹信義之規則、、並屏棄武力、則吾人縱有犧牲、亦極値得爲之也、」（二日路透電）</p>
<h3>法總理盼希特勒　理智克制暴力　否則不恤用武力相與周旋　德國所提保證無價值可言</h3>
<p>巴黎　衆議院頃於本日午後復會、由議長赫禮歐主席、內閣總理達拉第常即發表演說、略謂、「各國因欲維護和平有所努力、突由德國予以打消、該國所提各項建議、據云已由波蘭國政府加以拒絕、此乃謊言、實則此項建議、波蘭國迄無所知、吾人所重視者、厥乃德國元有希特勒行爲如何、其言論如何、在所不計、至以波蘭國而論、一九二一年以還、即已成爲吾國之同盟國、彼此所接受之的束、且屢决加以充實、吾國與英國已與該國簽訂互助條的、絕無予以放棄之意、亦不忍友邦被人滅亡、希特勒元首對於該國之行爲、實乃獨裁者企圖獨霸世界之又一步驟、吾國實逼處此、無論國家榮譽或國家生存攸關之利益、均已爲所涉及、余敢向法國民族曁全世界各國民族提出問題曰、「德國對於前奧國前捷克國暨波蘭國所提供之保證、旣已食言而肥、其對於吾國亞爾薩斯羅蘭兩省所提供之保證、叉復有何價値、吾法國人對於德國人並無仇恨之念、（各議員皆歡呼）但亦深知法國已在危急之秋、咸願克盡厥職、爲法國生存而戰、反之、吾國當局倘欲出以冒險舉動而實行總動員、則全國人民決不應命、時至此日、吾人職責所在、厥乃制止暴力舉動、苟能以和平手段達到目的、固屬佳事、侵略國若已喪失理智、則雖訴諸武力亦所不辭、議員諸公乎、發號施令權在法國、至是達拉第總理對於義國政府欲以和平手段替代暴力所作之高尙努力表示敬意云、「該國政府進行調解若果賡續不已、吾人即準備加以贊助、」達拉第總理旋又宜讀勒勃倫總統咨文、其詞略謂、「中歐洲業已發生戰事德國在仍可進行談判之時、突然向波蘭國進攻、英法兩國竭力弭戰、卒無效果、德波兩國民族對於全世界良知之呼聲、倘仍不能予以聆取、則戰爭必無已時、至以法國而論、決當履行一切的束、（各議員皆歡呼　（吾人務當精誠團結法國萬歲」云、在塲諸人咸皆歡呼若狂、歷久始已、（一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>誰是戎首？　希特勒復羅斯福指斥波蘭　波政府聲明德國突然開釁</h3>
<p>華盛頓　羅斯福總統會於上月廿五廿六兩日連電德國元首希特勒呼籲和平、該國代辦湯麥遜頃以希特勒元首名義、以覆文送達赫爾國務卿、但其措詞係由該代辦出面、內稱、「鄙人奉政府命令、請求貴國務卿轉陳貴國大總統、敝國元首對於上月廿五廿六日兩電、極爲欽佩、敝國元首對於德波兩國爭議、原曾竭盡全力、以覓致友好解决方案、甚至在最後一分鐘、尙接受英國政府之調處、無如波蘭態度、異常崛强、所有種種努力、均已宣告失敗矣云、」（一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>華沙　政府頃發表公報稱、駐德大使李潑斯基於昨日三十一日）晚間訪晤德國外交部長里賓特洛浦、進行談話、幷告以波蘭政府業已接受英國居問調處之議、無如德國政府竟以類似袞的美敦書之方式、用無綫電宣佈其十六項建議、「此項要求自非任何政府所接受、抑且德國提出此項建議之用意、厥在搆成開始敵對行動之口實、此於該國提出建議數小時後、即行出兵相犯一舉、可以見之、抑波蘭政府前會一再聲明、對於但澤市問題、曁德波兩國邦交問題、均隨時準備依照調處方式、覓致解决、可見目下事變責任、應由德國負之、」至外傳波蘭軍隊會經侵犯德國邊境、絕非事實云、（一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>歐局紛擾與義大利</h3>
<p>昨論德國向波蘭開火後之國際大概情形，及所予遠東曁中國抗戰之影響。今日請以義大利爲中心，續論歐局。論歐局之前，請先述有關中國之新聞二則，此在大局動盪中不遑申論而極可玩味者也。（一）蘇聯新任駐華大使巴納樞金氏到重慶已閱相當時日，各方秘而未宣；及前日即九月一日，忽以晋謁主席，投遞國書聞。其致辭中有二語：一曰蘇聯援華抗戰，並非虛言；一日就職以發展並加强中蘇兩國之合作爲己任。大使到任，照例致辭；致辭照例以輯睦邦交爲言；更有以本地風光爲點綴者，如來中國則稱述抗戰之英勇也，同情也；若此决新任蘇聯大使所云云，非泛泛如恒例也。（二）英國新任駐美大使西恩勛爵纔遞國書，其使命當然在英美間；顧乃隔昨對新聞記者發表談話，不曰英美間如何，而日英國遠東政策仍以九國公的爲原則，又日二十五年來情勢大變，，當年有英日同盟，而今有九國公的云。以英國之駐美大使初决發表談話而坦白談遠東政策，應非偶然也。惟此二端，讀者其更得安心靜觀歐局演變矣乎！</p>
<p>論歐局，請先體認現階段之事實；謂現階段，惟有迄記者握管時所得消息爲依據；則有要點四焉：（一）德軍對波，數路進攻；察其軍略，殆以政治目的爲標準，故其主力逼波蘭走廊。（二）英法兩國駐德大使對於德國外長里賓特洛浦氏所致變相之哀的美敦，德國方面既未接受，亦未拒絕；（外傳拒絕之說，未經公報證實）故英法兩大使之請簽護照而下旗歸國，亦當有待。（三）美國總統羅斯福氏對於德軍攻波，尙未認爲戰爭狀態已成立：故爲修正中立法而有待召集之國會，亦未決行。然於各方所不分皂白而稱德波爲敵對行動者，羅斯福總統則稱爲德軍侵波，即此一字之貶，具見美國態度嚴正。美國駐德大使威爾遜氏休假返國，日前猶傳即將回任，而昨日忽爾辭職，即經批准；美國政府不但聲稱威爾遜氏調任國務院要職，且謂遺缺是吾另行選任，尙未決定云；此其意義，表示嫉惡不啻也。此外足證美國同情英美者正多。（四）義大利聲明不作軍事發動。今後之歐局，或有種種意想中之開展，或有種種不可思議之演變，而上述四點殆將爲重要之酵母，讀者値得多多注意者也。</p>
<p>關於義大利事，可謂最近演變中之別開生面者。倘若德波事擴爲歐戰，擴爲世界戰，則義大利必陷漩渦之中，是不待論；若不大延擴，則義大利近頃之作風，隱然形成最近將來收拾歐局中之要角，行且爲世人所刮目相看者也。讀者必憶及在第一决世界大戰時，義大利嘗背棄其友邦德奧而加入英法集團；今後之事，當然不容以歷史紀錄，作「默書式」之推論。</p>
<p>五六日前，本報論歐洲事，於德義兩國最近態度行動之若即若離，指陳之爲「在外交最後序慕中必別有其妙用；」近兩日，妙用始著。德義在國際，相呼應，相表裏，其事蹟不勝舉；及自反共公的進而締結軍事盟的，兩國關係確臻共甘苦共生死之化境。攷其最大之目標，對英法也。今德國有事於波蘭，英法爲踐的而奮起，是應爲德義最見交情之關頭，亦表演赴湯蹈火，最嚴重之共同節目也；詎知德元首於英法血脈債張之際，波蘭砲火連天之時，悠然謝義國日，不勞援助；義政府亦國際宣告日，義國不入漩渦，不作軍事發動云。此豈德藐義，義背德？此豈兩國瀕於仳離，軍的竟如具文？日不然，蓋有妙用者也。所以暗示英法不必踐的援波者一，所以穩定左袒波蘭之土耳其羅馬尼亞諸國者二，所以見德國志在但澤與波蘭走廊而別無野心者三，所以旁證德義軸心不欲破壞全歐和平者四，所以自保國力亦即所以保全軸心力量者五，所以使歐洲各國儀之感覺大難臨頭者，緣是而相率期望縮小範圍，倖免於難者六，使反軸心各國在軍略上因義國之不發動而幾於無法展開陣綫者七，使德國後方獲有寬暢之空間者八。夫孰甘戰爭？德義兩國當局蓋覷破一切而籌之熟矣，經里賓特洛浦與齊亞諾二氏之促膝而談，遂圖案而成此妙局！德國每一大舉，輒示人以神出鬼沒，獨對義大利無秘密；蘇德締交訂的，英法日本皆在彀中，而德國獨告義大利，是其近例；德國此决無意於受英調解而與波談判，具有用兵決心，是亦義大利所熟知；然於德國開火之前夕，義大利吿法國日願事斡旋，使法國啼笑皆非而無以拒之。此實軸心行動之又一端，猶爲涉訟而先行存案，妙用在方來者也。其事不足訓、但得因此而使歐局短縮其紛擾慘痛之時間空間，則又所不必厚非者矣。</p>

<h3>莫洛托夫外交報告德蘇訂約經過</h3>
<p>（續昨）余今繼續討論蘇德不侵犯公的、蘇聯與德國締結此項公的、最初決定、係在英法蘇軍事談判、因上述不能尅服之爭執而陷於僵局之後、吾人因談判經過、表明互助公的之締結、已屬無望、乃不得不探覓其他保障和平及消滅德蘇戰爭危機之可能方法、英法政府苟不願計及此點、彼等儘可自由、吾人之責任、則爲考慮蘇聯民衆及蘇維埃社會主義聯邦之利益、（持久鼓掌）允其因吾人探信蘇聯之利益、乃與各國民衆之基本利益相符、（鼓掌）「此猶爲問題之一方面、此外蘇德兩國苟欲成立互不侵犯公的、必須德國在其外交政策上、改採與蘇聯敦睦邦交之態度、此第二條件成立後、亦即吾人明知德國政府確願改變外交政策、從而改進對蘇邦交之後、兩國互不侵犯公的成立基礎、方始奠定、「人人共知六年以來、即自國社黨秉政之後、德蘇政治關係、歷在緊張狀態之中、人人亦知雖兩國立塲及政治體系不同、蘇聯政府仍會努力羅持對德國之正常商業及政治關係、諸君周知近年來此類關係中曾發生各種獨立事件、現在不必再加詳述、余必須指出者、爲數月前吾黨十八屆代表大會中關於吾外交政策之說明、</p>
<p>斯達林當時連及吾人外交政策方面之任務時、曾闡明吾國對各國之態度如下、第一、繼續和平政策及與一切國家增强事務上之關係、第二、隨時審愼、母使吾國被善於利用他人火中取粟之挑撥戰爭家引入衝突、」（興奮）如此、斯達林早已宣言蘇聯力主與一切國家增强事務關係、同時、斯達林更警吿吾人、毋受專爲本身利益、力圖使吾國與他國發生衝突之挑撥戰爭家利用、斯達林並曾暴露英法美等國報紙關於德國佔領蘇聯烏克蘭「計劃之喧嘩之眞相、其言曰、「此可疑的喧嘩之目的、似在挑撥蘇聯反對德國、毒化空氣而無理由與德國啟釁、斯達林於此、已將努力挑撥德蘇衝突之西歐政治家之陰謀、澈底揭發、但吾人必須承認即在吾國亦有短視之人、彼等被過度簡單之反法西斯宣傳所中、竟忘記敵人之此種挑撥、斯達林慮及此　、當時即曾提及德蘇成立善鄰關係之可能、</p>
<p>現在吾人可知德國在大體上、業經正確理解斯達林之上述宣言、從而引申實際的結論、（大笑）蘇德互不侵犯公的之締結、說明斯達林之歷史的預見、業已完全證實、本年春季、德政府即向吾國建議重開商務信用談判、不久此談判即經重開、雙方互作讓步後兩國乃成立協定、而於八月十九日簽宇、德蘇兩國簽定此種協定、此非初决、但此恊定、不但與一九三五年之協定不同、即與過去一切協定、甚至吾國與英法或任何國家所締任何經濟協定比較、亦屬有利、其有利點乃在信用之期限長達七年、以及使吾國有機會定購多量必須之設備品、蘇聯方面、亦願以多餘之原料品一定額量售與德國、供共工業之用、此與吾國利益亦屬相符、如此有利的經濟協定、吾人安能拒絕、豈爲獻媚於彼、不願蘇聯與他國成立有利經濟協定之徒乎、且此協定、不但適合吾國之經濟及國防利益、亦與吾黨上八屆大會所通過、斯達林關於「增强對一切國家事務關係係」之需要之宣言相符、及至德政府並表示更願改進政治關係之後、蘇聯政府亦自無理由拒絕、因此、乃發生成立互不侵犯公約之問題、目前各方面所起之聲浪、適足證明彼等不理解現正開始之改進蘇德政治關係之　簡單的理山、例如有人以天亂之態度問曰、蘇聯何能同意與法西斯型國家改進政治關係、但彼等忘却此非吾人對他國國內政體之問題、而係兩國外交關係之問題、彼等忘却吾入之主張爲不干涉他國內政同時亦不許他國干涉吾國內政（未完）</p>
<h3>蘇聯更調駐德大使</h3>
<p>莫斯科　蘇聯政府頃任命希克伐爾齊夫爲駐德大使、聞希克伐爾齊夫日內即將前往柏林履新、原任駐德大使梅勒夫洛調回、另有任用、（二日海通電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　政府某一極可靠官員、根據倫敦及巴黎方而機密消息、向美聯社記者聲稱、英法二國以一百萬分之一機會將於今日對德宣戰、倘正式宣戰、羅斯福總統定將召集國會特別會義、其日期大的爲星期一日、（二日美聯電）</p>
<h3>英政府宣布對德交涉經過</h3>
<p>倫敦　英國在八月底竭力設法挽救局勢之情形、已詳見今日此間所發表之白皮書、內載倫敦與拍林間最近所交換之文件、英國於八月廿八日致德國之復文中、會建議波德直接討論、並得波蘭之許可、通知德國、謂波蘭已準備立即與德國從事直接之討論、德國當於翌日（二十九日）將書面答復、交於英國駐德大使漢特森、內容措詞、除對於引起此决危機之各種事實作牽强附會之聲辯外、更要求波蘭派遣全權代表一人、於八月三十日到達柏林、英方之第二决答復、係於八月三十日午夜遞交德外長里賓特羅甫、德方對此、即發表一種冗長之文件作爲答復、此項文件、顯然即爲德國所發表之十六點計劃是、當英大使漢特森要求德國發表此項提案之原文時、德外長答以因波蘭專使未能於午夜趕到柏林、現時已覺過遲矣、波蘭獲聆上述之各種發展情形後、會於八月三十日下午通知英國、謂波方將授權其駐柏林大使李比斯基、宣布波蘭已接受英國所主張進行談判之提議、德外長直至八月卅一日傍晚、始接見波蘭大使、會晤之後、德方即用無綫電廣播其提案、波蘭大使欲立即與華沙方面成立接觸、但因波德間一切交通均被德國所封鎖、遂致不果云、英方此决所發表之來往函電、首爲八月廿六日英相張伯倫以英政府名義、致希特勒之函件、函內先述英國已開始採取之防範辦法、並稱、據英政府之意、因德方屢有軍事行動之傳聞、且因柏林方面有若干人士以爲德蘇協定之宣布、可表示英國代表波蘭出而干預之舉、已不復再能實現、故認爲實有採取各項防範步驟之必要、德所國鑄之錯誤、當莫過於此、蓋德蘇協定之性質不論如何、決不能更改英國對於波蘭所負之義務、英政府已屢决明白聲明決心予以履行也、英相又鄭重聲言、英政府不願他人對於其態度發生誤會、並援引其八月廿四日在下院之言論、謂萬一事變發生、英國已決心立即使用其所有之武力起而周旋云、首相末稱、余對於英國所處之地位、已有十分明白之表示、余深信英德兩國如不幸而發生戰事、則將爲世界莫大之災難、余敢斷言兩國之人民皆不願其如此也、余以爲波德兩國間之問題、如雙方能恢復信任、開誠布公互相討諭、則決無不能和平解決之理由也、吾人已隨時準備造成一種環境、俾使此項談判得能進行、並可同時討論影響未來國際關係之較廣泛問題、與芙德兩國有關之各事亦包括在內云、</p>
<p>希特勒於八月二十三日答復英國、謂德國有某數項切實利益不能放棄、惟此項利益、並不超出德國以前歷史所規定之限制、並係出於重大之經濟需要云、關於但澤及波蘭走廊問題、希氏則以波蘭對於一百五十萬德人所施行之恐怖行爲、歸咎於英國之向波蘭担保、希氏末稱、必須負凡爾賽和的責任之各國改變其精神、然後英德關係始有改善之可能云、</p>
<p>希氏又於八月二十五日與英大使漢特森晤面時、談及英外相哈立法克斯及英相張伯倫八月二十四日在國會中之演說、謂英方所發德國擬克服全世界之說、殊爲可哂、希氏並稱、渠已準備並決定於德波問題解決之後、再與英方接洽一種更偉大及更廣博之條件云、</p>
<p>英國當於八月二十八日答復希特勒八月二十三日及二十五日之來文及談括、指出希氏所提關於英德兩國關係之建議、係屬最普通之形式、但波德問題如能獲得和平之處理、則英政府已準備予以接受而加討論、今後之第二步辦法、應由德波舉行直接談判、並謂英方現已獲得波蘭之切實保證、表示巳準備依保陣波蘭重大利益、並由國際担保而獲得解決之基礎、與德國進行討論、波德問題之公正解決、或可開闢世界和平之途徑云、</p>
<p>希特勒於八月二十九日將復文面交漢特森大使、內容係申訴波蘭之種種軍事行動、及波蘭對於但澤自由市之許多侵略行爲、並謂波蘭境內之德人、備受波蘭之虐待、德國容忍已歷數月、今已不得不採取必要之手段、以保護德國之利益矣、德國現已不復相信德波間之糾紛、可由直接談判而解決、惟英國旣有此提議、德國亦願加以嘗。試云、</p>
<p>英方所發表之函電中、更有八月三十日英政府致駐德大使漢特森之電文數通、大意係謂、英國雖重視目前事勢之緊急、係認德國所提波蘭專使必須於午夜到達柏林之要求爲毫無理由、最後一電內、英國建議德國應按照外交常例、於提案準備就緒之後、邀請波蘭大使前來、交其轉達華沙云、</p>

<p>兒童周刊怎樣節省課業用品？  奮飛　　——一個重嬰的建議——　　二十八年度上學期已開始了！諸位又耍天天上學讀書，關於你們的課業用品，我以爲必須要節省，因爲你們應該知道，在這個「米珠薪桂」的時候，生活上一切的消費，都要節省，金錢是你們父兄血汗所換的代價，如何可以隨便浪費呢？允其在孤島上讀書的小朋友，更要切實履行，父兄師長也必須時時注意，每一個小朋友是吾有浪費課業用品的事實，若有；趕快指導他們，或加以相當懲戒，同學之間，也要互相勸導，互相監視。　　我時常看見小朋友們，有許多浪費課業用品的事實，現在不妨寫在下面：（一）在空閒的時候，往往把鉛筆用小刀來削，並且削得鉛筆頭很長很尖，所以在要用的當兒，一個不留神，便將鉛筆頭弄斷，斷了再削，削了又斷，因此，一枝鉛筆用不到幾天便完了，那末，勢必再要去買。（二）一本作文簿，因爲在做的時候，起先沒有用草稿，所以一頁一頁添註塗改，自己看上去也不行，於是不得不撕去，重新把它謄出來，如果每做一次作文都是這樣，一本簿子如何會經用呢？（三）寫字用的墨筆，因爲在用好的時候，沒有洗去墨汁，於是筆頭膠得硬硼硼了，要寫是不可能了，有些小孩子，竟把筆頭在硯台上瞎捺，筆頭便脫落，要寫字，便必須再買一枝新筆了！（四）磨墨的時候，不肯揑正了麼，隨便一磨，不知不覺地傾斜了，像一隻小脚，等到越磨越斜以後，那粒剩下的墨長能再麼了，勢必棄掉。（五）抄書的洋簿，有許多不用心的小孩子，因爲抄的時候，弄了許多字，於是又要撕去重寫，並且還有用橡皮來擦，擦破了紙頭，也是撕去，更有人，因爲瞎塗沒有紙頭，便撕下作無意識的塗寫。……　　以上五點，不過是一些普通而易犯的毛病，諸位請想想吧！你們有沒有以上各個習慣？若有，趕快改過，吾則，你們浪費太大了！父兄担仟學費，已經負担很重了！允其在非常國難中，每一個小同胞，必須實行節的。你們再吃另食嗎？你們再會浪費課業用品嗎？你們再會粗心而遺失課業用品嗎？你們把節省下來的錢，肯儲蓄起來嗎？你們肯聽同學或師長的勸導嗎？我在想，你們一定會接受我的建議，對於這一學期的課業用品，必須加以節省才好。小朋友的失踪問題  秋郎　　前幾天本報連刊男孩姚玉山，馬韻軒，失踪的廣告數天，廣吿上並刊姚之全身半身照片，姚的廣吿內說：「前晨上午三時，有××公學同學馬韻軒，來寓敲開後門，的同姚玉山出走，姚年祇十四歲，隨帶洋三十餘元，及望遠鏡西裝等而去」云云；因知姚馬是同學，這私自出走的主因，雖難斷定，但年幼無知，被人謊騙誘惑，或意志薄弱，不顧利害，任性孤行，兩者是不出其一的。　　按姚玉山年僅十四歲，馬韻軒又年未成丁，都是童稚的小朋友，推測他們半夜出走，不留片字與家庭，又帶去望遠鏡等件，似因鑒於國難深重！不忍坐視，憤而同往前方去，那末他們的志願，殊堪欽佩的！　　在此國難嚴重之秋，憂國志士，拔劍砍地，長嘯呼天，奮臂興起，投筆從戎的，固是不乏其人，但年未成丁的小朋友，究屬思想學識幼稚，能力單薄，執戈衛國，尙非其時，仍以用功研求學術，將來儲爲國用，才是上策。　　可是事又不然，再看那兩則廣吿叉說：「對家庭縱有不滿之處，儘可相商」，和「彼年幼無能，釋之返家，俾得骨肉團聚」等語，則父似一個負氣出走，一個受騙被拘，情形較爲複雜，非局外人所得而知，祇可認爲兒童們的畸形事件，是深可慨嘆的了！　　總之，嗣後還請各家長父兄，和學校的師長，對於子弟（指家庭）學生（指學校）們，除教育方面外，更宜注意他們平日的行動，隨時愛威兼施的加以管束，更不許他們在午夜私自開門進出，以免出事之後，追悔無及啊。下車後  白正　　—明兒避難記之三十一二—　　一輛飛快的汽車直駛到了明兒的目的地。熱鬧的氣氛眾住了整個的車站，煩囂的聲音封住了明兒的那張久被車聲佔據了的耳殼　　「你們來了嗎？我們已等待了好一會兒」。一陣熟悉的女人聲音從他們一羣人的背後傳遞過來。不錯，那是張師母的喊聲。原來張先生的一家是搭第一班車來的，因爲他們對於這條路程是往常來慣的，所以呌他一家先來，可以照顧搭第二班車來的陌生客。獨個兒的伊，留在這裏等待他們。　　「張先生到那裹去了？其他的弟弟妹妹呢」？他們一羣人向着伊走去，張師母也迎着走來。明兒母親眼見伊一個人在車站裏，很奇怪的問着伊。　　「辛苦了！到過塘行裏去歇一歇，再說吧。行李已交給車站上的人，呌他們送到過塘行，不用我們費心了」。張師母向着他們說着，似乎忘了明兒母親的問話。　　明兒覺得嘴裏是十二分的枯澀，好幾小時沒有喝水了，而頭腦裏被軋軋的車聲和一路的顚頓也打攪得七葷八素；四周的景物在他眼前團團的打轉，脚裏也軟得站不住。　　他們每一個人都覺得很疲之便隨着張師母離開了車站，拐了一個灣，就到了過塘行裹。那過塘行比了杭州的那一爿當然是小得多了，但還算淸潔，行裏堆滿了一包包的貨物，一陣陣的霉濕氣時時傳到他們的鼻中，明兒也無可奈何的忍受着。　　「今晚我們是躭擱在這裏。明天一淸早便趕路，早飯只好在路上吃了。從這裏到我的家鄕還有二十多里的山路，沒有船也沒有車子，只有轎子，不然祇好走了，幸虧路還不算十分長，張先生，他今天先趧到家裏去了，因爲家裹人還沒有知道我們帶着這一大羣的貴客回來，他預先去關照他們一聲史預備我們到了那裏的住和吃的問題」。張師母滔滔不絕的很客氣的說着。　　「眞是費你們的心，張先生幹事又十分仔細，眞使我們感激萬分。明大的二十里山路容易不容易走」？明兒母親接口問着。　　我們走慣的，一些也不覺得什麼。那一路的風景，不會使你們失望的，似乎是在遊假山，這更可滅除了我們不少的疲勞，倒霉了脚，而飽了限福」。張師母很有風趣，而又很欣悅的說着。伊是回家鄉，不是逃難，怪不得要快樂了。明兒呷了一口茶，又香又甜，嘴裏頓時潤滑了，頭腦裏便隨着舒適而恢復了常態。　　那晚，明兒陲在一間狹小房裏的地板上。變了一個環境，他無論怎樣合不上眼，而霉濕氣又不時的刺進他的鼻子裏，眞難受。「我們離別了故鄉快半年了，逃東逃西，沒有一定的處所，用掉了無數的金錢。飽嘗了不少的苦楚，而這樣一天無聊的度去，只有消費沒有生產、　　我們怎樣的」？明兒的腦海裹浮起了這一個感觸。他更想起了可愛的家鄉，眼珠不禁的從他眼角裏淌下來。「不過我們終有一天在凱歌聲中重回故鄉，那時不知要怎樣的快樂哩」。明兒又樂觀起來了。中國的聖地（下）  壽清　　大成殿北面有」座聖蹟殿，裏面有許多石碑，碑面上刻着孔子週遊列國的事蹟。　　打聖蹟殿折向東走，經過了一重矮小的紅牆，到了孔子的家廟。相傳這便是孔子生時的作家；那裏有一堵名呌「魯璧」的圍牆，在孔子死後，魯國有一個君王要蓋宮殿，想把這堵壁拆去，忽然天空中發出音樂和讀書之聲，他們知道是孔子顯靈，便不敢拆了，一直保存到現在。這當然只是傳說，不大可靠的；不過，由此足見吾國古人是怎樣地崇拜孔子了。　　出了家廟，又到前面的文賢閣去玩了一回，於是走到曲阜城北的孔子墓去。那兒圍着一堵很大的城牆，牆內植滿各種樹木。據說，這些樹木是在孔子死後，他的許多弟子從各處帶來種的。長得很是茂盛。所以那裏又稱做「孔林」。　　我們從曲阜北門，走過一條很長的「孔林神道」，便到了孔林的大門。進去，經過了一座洙水橋，和一座享殿，再往前走，便到了孔子的墓前，那裏堅着一塊石碑，上面刻着「大成至聖文宣王之墓」幾個金字。　　墓旁有三間殿屋，前面也堅着一塊石碑，碑上刻着「子貢廬墓處」幾個字。子貢是孔子的一個好弟子，他在孔子死後，曾在這孔子的墓旁，搭了一間茅屋，守了三年的喪。　　遊完孔林，天色已經不早了。我們便回到車站，趁了火車回到了徐州府。　　現在，我們這聖地的景况，怎樣了？曾不曾又到侵略者的汚辱？摧殘？實在令人繫念！汗  楊立齋　　夏是熱的，熱得個個人要嚷着『熱呀！熱呀！』別說在火傘般的太陽底下遊戲，就是坐在沒有太陽曬到的屋子裹看報，還受不住熱的侵凌，「汗」在汗毛孔裏直冒的冒出來，淋濕了全身。　　也許小朋友要問：天熱爲什麼要出汗？汗究竟是什麼？汗的百分之九十九以上是水；此外還有少量的鹽。脂肪尿素等，懸浮着或溶解在水中，所以汗是鹹的且具特臭。待水分蒸發以後，皮膚上往往有白色的結晶物遺留着，這便是汗液中不能蒸發的鹽質。　　汗，是從血液中排泄出來的一種廢物，但是有調節體溫的功用。因爲水分在蒸發時，要吸收多量的熱；汗液蒸發，體熱也跟着散去。所以在夏季天熱時，或運動之後，體溫贈高，發汗，使多散熱就也增加，以保持攝氏三十七度的體溫。　　扇子，所以有驅熱生凉的功效，也就是因為牠能鼓勵空氣，促進汗液的蒸發。當我們汗流浹背的時候，扇子一揮，便覺遍體凉爽，汗兒消失，就是這個道理。畜生道中（十六）  心青　　諾克斯休息了一會，重把彭其啣了起來，雖見幾個人一面吶喊，一面跑過來，它也不做理會，自管把彭其啣到柳樹下的毛爾格去，和兩頭死一頭死貓一隻舊帽子放在一起，完了它的手續。於是搖擺着身體，抖去了滿身的水，便回家用早膳去了。　　後來有人在柳樹下發見了彭其，便把他送回家去。只爲他在水中浸得太久了，飽受了風寒，就害起病來，病了好久，方始慢慢地恢復了健康。他曾把當時飛升月球到畜生道去的惰形說給大家聽，可是大家都不相信，當做是一段神話。他們以爲彭其一定是坐在柳樹上，偶不小心而跌到水中去的；至於月球啊，畜生道啊，不過是病中熱度增加，由神經錯亂而幻想出來的。　　彭其在漸漸復元的時期間，還是躺在牀上，不能起身，每天陪伴他的，只有他的父母親，和兩位小妹妹。這兩位小姑娘心腸很軟，最愛畜類，和從前的彭其是絕對相反的。他們原也知道哥哥的脾氣，却沒有法兒安慰他，使他快樂，只索把伊們所愛好的，來設法引起哥哥的興趣。伊們在這一間小小病室中，裝點些花啊，草啊，水族啊，小動物啊，倒像是一個畜生道的小小模型。彭其自從在畜生道中受了那偌大的教訓以後，脾氣早就改變過來了。他見兩位小妹妹愛水族，他也愛水族，每天往往親自把紅蟲喂給它們吃；並且把他身邊最後的一個小銀元送給女下人，呌伊早晨上樓來時，脚下要特別留心一些，因爲有一天淸早，有一尾熟帶魚跳出水槽，跳到了樓梯上去，那女下人恰恰走上樓來，偶不小心，竟把它生生的踏死了。</p>

<p>游藝界希特勒與影星們  亦思　　讀了本刊華志君所作關於「波蘭女明星不做希持勒愛人」一文後，憶及當年希氏與女明星們幾段頗饒興趣之「戀史」，特記述如下：　　與瑪琳黛德麗－一九三三年，德政府曾命令僑居國外的電影明星和技術家全部歸國，在祖國拍片，「共爲德意志文化建設而努力」。　　爲了恐怕有人對於這條令忽視而不遵守，希特勒進一步嚴重地警吿：「凡是不遵守這個命令的，非特要被認爲不忠於祖國，而且將被宣判爲文化叛徒」。　　在好萊塢的瑪琳黛德麗，便是接奉這個命令而回的女朋星之一，她是德國女優中負有國際聲譽最隆的一個。在她回國的第二天，希特勒便特派專使，前往訪謁，傳述他底一番愛護之厚意，對她說：「德意志張臂歡迎你，而且已爲你備下了一個特殊的地位與優渥的崇敬」。希特勒的意思是願意任命她爲「德意志電影總裁」。但是，瑪琳的回答只是一聲淡淡的謝謝」，從第三天起，希氏每天派人向黛德麗致送鮮花，但不到兩個月的某一天，「送花專使」忽將花退給希氏，原來在上一天晚上，黛德麗已經啟程回好萊塢了！　　與黃柳霜·黃柳霜漫游歐洲大陸的時候，曾經受到各國觀衆的熱烈歡迎，可是希特勒却不許她在德國舞台上登台，爲了她底鼻子太低，而且身上沒有「雅里安人的血統」。但是黃柳霜非常幽默，她以一星期的時間請醫生替她改造鼻子，把它造得高了一些，然後叉在報上徵求向雅里安人借血，兩樣事情都辦好之後，她便在柏林一家著名舞塲里演劇。報紙上於黃柳霜上面加着「高鼻子的，有雅里安血統的」頭銜，柏林當局果然沒有取締她，而那家舞塲也賣了幾晚的滿座。　　與麗芬絲坦－麗芬絲坦今年三十歲，是一個鐵匠的女兒。一九二三年時她開始在慕尼克的一家舞塲里作歌女，不久之後，便轉入了電影界。　　希特勒喜歡她的銀幕藝術，以私人名義僱用了她，她底職務是「指導希特勒拍照姿勢」，據說，麗芬在希特勒處享受了任何女人所沒有享受過的權利，她在指導攝影之外，還指導他滑冰，傳說他倆有過通宵滑冰的紀錄。法國某報會載希特勒陷入了麗芬情網，並且說，麗芬曾經這樣批評希特勒：「在戰塲上，他也許是一位英雄，在情塲上，他僅僅是一個孩子」，那張報紙便從此不許在德國境內銷售。高占非留渝　白楊將軍獨返滬  慧　　（重慶通訊）旅居新都的白楊高占非，自接到上海新華公司張善琨匯去的千元法幣後，不禁心爲之動，擬即離渝返滬，但當地的朋友，均不滿他倆就此返滬，所以，對他倆譏諷頗力，並且有人在暗地責駡他倆爲無血性之流，以致高白兩人意態頓時消極，返滬行期祇得暫緩了。不過，他倆旣接受了張善琨匯去的路費而叉中止其行，那倒不知要如何去交代呢！　　最近，「中電」因底片來源困難，攝片工作已無形停頓，所以，高白兩人目前並無戲拍，現在他倆正雙雙同居於南濃度夏，本來，他倆以爲「中電」旣無戲拍，况且合同又將期滿，正可在此時返滬另謀發展，但又怎會聊到遭友人的物議！　　現在，聽說中國電影製片廠，頗有意羅致老高，因爲「中製」拍片工作刻仍在積極進行，演員人材頗爲需要，而對老高印象亦佳。但是老高的意思，須白楊一起加入，而「中製」方面對白楊則並不需要，以致事成擱淺。現在，高白兩人在重慶已覺得左右兩難了。不過，據接近他倆的友人看來，結果，老高或許會加入「中製」的，因爲他返滬本來是有着人事上的困難的。　　而白楊在重慶根本並無其他去處，况且人家對她的印象並不甚好，所以，她將單獨的返滬，另謀發展，倘使他倆是眞的這樣做，那麼這一雙同居已久的「愛侶」，一旦突吿分離，在內心上的痛苦自然不言而喩的。　　今日因廣吿擁擠，「梨園外紀」再停一天，請讀者原諒。（編者）遠東影院公司的第一聲　大華大戲院落成有日　　以嶄新的姿態……映頭輪的鉅片　　隣近卡德路的靜安寺路上，聳立着一座曠廢已久古堡式的影院，要是你不健忘的話，大概不會忘記這就是夏令配克影戲院。它在過去的影院史上，佔着極重要的一頁，有聲電影發軔的那一年，第一個介紹到東方上海來的，就是這位元老夏令配克。現在這座含有歷史性的電影院基地，經過一番脫胎換骨的手術，重在這動盪大時代中，肩荷起電影的重大使命，它的替身就是正在興建中的大華大戲院，英文名稱據說是Roxy　Theatre。　　大華大戲院的籌建計劃，發動遠在半年以前。發起人都是中美兩國在商界負有聲望的人經過多决縝密的集議後，組成美商遠東影院公司，推定富有影院經騐的人來負責一切。他們的願望是：要在人口密集的上海市，建造一座最合乎大衆理想的電影院，無論聲音光綫座位上，都要超過當代任何的影院，同時奢望着要造成最崇高的地位，使得每一個觀衆身心上都領受到娛樂的眞意義，而認爲不枉費這娛樂代價。所以，他們在建築與設計上，都不惜工本的刻意求工，費用的浩大着實驚人咧。　　全部建築工程由華蓋建築事務所主持，大上海及金城大戲院是他最好的樣品。技術顧問是名傾一時的鴻達建築師，光陸國泰平安三戲院都是他個人有名的建築物。以二位赫赫有名建築師的頭腦，設計的盡善盡美是無疑的事實。聽說無論鉅細工程，兩位建築師都是虛心下氣孜孜研討，以雙方滿意爲最後標的，辦事精神的謹嚴不苟，是値得欽佩的。　　座位約有一千二百，親定每一隻座位的間隙，都有充裕的容膝地位。面型的設計，眞够得上偉麗兩個形容詞，它是兩位建築師筆底下的合力傑作，也許遠東第一家有這樣的構築。左面就是面型的繪圖，的略可以窺出它美麗宏偉到何等地步。　　大華大戲院放映影片是那一家影片公司的出品？的確是極大的啞謎，也是大衆議論紛紜的焦點。吿訴你，大華所映的影片，有一家是獅頭商標名震全球米高梅公司頭輪鉅片。你便可想見對於影片的選擇是怎樣的精密。開幕日期大致是十一月內吧！</p>

<p>星期增刋現代人物希特勒的秘訣  未生　　克敵要訣　　　希特勒自奪得德國政權以來，收回塞爾，併吞奧大利，滅亡捷克，氣燄高張不可一世！最近又藉口但澤和波蘭走廊問題，調兵遣將，公然挑釁，使歐洲和平沒法維持，數千百萬人民的生殺之權，居然操在他一人之手！　　究竟希特勒有什麽超人的本領，或出寄制勝的秘訣？據法國某作家的見解，希特勒的秘訣，拆穿了，亦很平常。一言以蔽之，他知道要打倒一個敵人，應該克服他的抵抗力量；而所謂抵抗力量，含有兩個不可分的原素：第一是他作戰的能耐，第二是發揮這種能耐的決心。　　攻心為上　　假使敵人的戰圖力極薄弱，而抗戰精神却很激昂，希特勒必先多方設法，運用其挑撥離間的手腕，威迫利誘的方法，使敵人的抗戰精神消沉下來；然後才可以不發一彈，將其征服。至於那些戰鬭力異常雄厚的假想敵人，希特勒更不敢輕易應付。他得加倍勞力緩和他們的反抗情緒，搖動他們的作戰決心。中國兵法所說的「用兵之道，攻心爲上，攻城爲下，」這種大道理，希特勒不但懂得，而且頗能實際應用。　　就拿他滅亡捷克的故事來說：在慕尼黑協定簽訂以前，捷克自以爲可以依賴外援，高枕無憂；縱使希特勒廿爲戒首，實行侵略，捷克亦不過在開戰幾個月內深蒙痛苦，而最後勝利則當然是有把握的。不料到了去年九月，英法變心，德匈波等國却同時壓迫，那才使捷克完全絕望，忍痛訂結了「城下之盟！」本來亡人國者，大抵先行擊破其兵力，使其無法繼續作軍事的抵抗，再則佔領其土地，使其不能有整理殘師，再圖一逞的根據，最後消滅其抗戰精神，使其永無反身之日。到那時戰爭的勝利，纔是持久的勝利。可是希特勒滅亡捷克的程序，郤正相反：他第一步把捷克的作戰決心根本摧毀後，第二步强佔她的領土，最後才解決她的軍隊。　　宣傳作用　　在「我的奮」一書中，希特勒迭决提到上次的世界大戰，可是他燸健的筆鋒不會描寫到戰塲上「伏屍百萬流血千里」等等的慘狀，亦不曾歌頌那些「披堅執銳衝鋒陷陣」的勇士。「我的奮圖」中，有兩章述及上决大戰的事蹟，一章的標題是「戰時宣傳，另一章是「德國革命。」據他的判斷，當時協的國的宣傳技術遠較德國爲優，而德國國內心懷貳志的少數民族，以及易於受人煽動的種極人物，又都是協的國宣傳員和間諜活動的最好目標。所以希特勒希望建設一個純粹的日耳曼民族的國家，同時痛恨着猶太人，社會主義者，和天主教徒等。他爲防止外國宣傳「毒」流入國境起見，竭力蒙蔽其國民的耳目。所以現在德國人對於世界情况，比較一九一八年時，還要隔膜，還要糊塗。　　三種方法　　希特勒從德國過去的經騐中，得到深刻的教訓。他想要對付英法應該「即以其人之道，反治其人之身。」第一，他所策動的對外宣傳非常澈底。在他歷决的演說辭中，沒有一决不反復陳訴德國有恢復其旣失權利的道義上的理由。無論對於塞爾也好，奧大利也好，捷克也好，但澤和波蘭也好，德國所以要提出要求，實在是有其不可吾認的權利。爲什麼整片的德國土地要被波蘭走廊割裂爲二？這是不是公道？是不是合理？英法等國寗願犧牲數百萬生靈以維持這種不公道不合理的局面，是不是甘心和德國作對？英法等國果然肯尊重德國權利而把但澤和走廊問題解決，德國決不會再有任何的要求了。歐洲永久和平的基礎可以從此奠定，英法何苦崛强到底，因小而失大呢？　　第一，希特勒在創迭任何「奇蹟」的前夕，必先調動大軍，耀武揚威，同時其公私宣傳機關又必盡力鋪張德國軍備的强大，以便懾服他的敵人。　　第三，希特勒無時無刻不想掀起其假想敵國的內亂。朋知英法二國內政修明，無懈可擊，此事難以奏效，而仍在竭力慫恿阿爾薩斯的自治運動和愛爾蘭的獨立。此外國社黨的間諜入員又深入各國內部，向在野黨領袖分頭運動，希望引起政潮，擾亂輿論。　　最近德波二國巳實行開火，希特勒事前何嘗不想再來一個慕尼黑協定？只要張伯倫達拉第之流再蹈去年的覆轍，態度一軟化，但澤波蘭便將步蘇台德捷克的後塵，希特勒則可如願以償了。　　和戰關鍵　　但澤和走廊的本身價値還不算什麼，可怕的是，到那時，目前英法的與國如希臘羅馬尼亞土耳其等都不能不對英法失望而投入希特勒懷抱中去。最後，英法之間亦勢非互相齟齬而分裂，因分裂而孤立；因孤立而易於各個擊破：希特勒建設「第三大德雄志帝國的迷夢便可實現了。」　　所謂希特勒克敵制勝的秘訣，不過如此。戰地一角蘇南重地的　張渚  庸　　從綿延的天目山脈出安徽一境，再越過高峻的銅官山，地勢就遂漸平坦，形成一個大盆地，站在山坡上往下看，有一條遼闊的河流自萬山深處，蜿蜒的越過京杭國道，出羣山叢中，向北一直通到宜興溧陽，以至於江南各縣城，在河南的兩岸，重重疊疊的堆砌着無數的房屋，恰在三面環山的一個中心點，這就是我在這裏勾留二個月的張渚鎭。　　水陸交通樞紐　　握着水陸交通樞紐的張渚，戰前是蘇浙皖邊數一數二的大鐘，人烟稠密商業繁盛，可以抵得上三等縣的縣城。抗戰開始，淞滬不守，江南各地次第淪陷，所僅餘的這一塊乾淨土，遂成爲流浪老的集合地，市面益形熱鬧，酒菜館旅館生意興隆，百貨業應接不暇，街道上說得着摩肩繼踵，熙攘往來，一切都呈着畸形的發展。橫貫鎭旁的京杭國道和通廣德的支路，雖然是因爲戰事關係而破壞了，但是一切輸出和輸入的貨物，仍可利用河道和原有的大路運送，所以張渚依舊不失爲一個商品集散地。　　形勢非常險要　　因為背山面湖（隔湖）形勢非常險要，而且是江蘇通皖南浙西的惟一孔道，在軍事上遂佔着極重要的地位，一面是握住了皖浙門戶的鎖鑰，一面還可以控制無錫常州，隨時予京滬綫以威脅，所以日軍在攻陷宜興之後，乘着銳氣一鼓而下張渚。但是張渚的地形於他太不利了，高低起伏的山嶺，到處是叢密深艷的竹園，非但坦克車失其效用，就是飛機也看不出什麽目標，無法施展其威力。日軍到了裹面，茫無頭緒，僅僅逗留了十九日，再也立足不住，一直退到滆湖以北，方才站住脚頭。現在自張渚向北以至滆湖南岸，東起太湖，西迄高淳，這一條弧形陣綫，始終在華軍的掌握之中。　　爭銅官山趣事　　關於當時爭奪銅官山陣地時，曾有這樣有趣的事；「華軍因工事全被日軍砲火損毀，被迫退出陣地，日軍進據華軍陣地之後，還沒有來得及更換旗幟，三架漆着紅太陽微的重轟炸機已經隆隆的飛來，駕駛員一眼看見山頭上飄揚着靑天白日旗，不管三七二十一，一連下了十幾個炸彈，於山崩地裂，血肉橫飛中，幾百個日軍被犧牲了。在這樣混亂的狀態中，華軍遂乘機猛烈反攻，等到日軍司令部得到正確情報，再派兩只巨型的輪送機裝載着大批糧食，飛到銅官山的上空，麪包，餅干，蛋糕，牛肉，像雨點般的落下，而那時躱在壕溝裏的，却正是華方英勇的將士們了！」　　人民生活安定　　張渚雖然地處前綫，砲聲時常可以聽到，有時雙方激戰，還可聞得淸晰的機槍聲，而商人却照常營業，農民照常耕種，並沒有一些驚慌的態度，這原因是洞悉日人無力進攻，所以在緊張中仍保持着鎮靜。　　這裹的教育，並不因戰事而停頓，晨間晚上，可以見到莘莘學子，挾着書包，很快樂的入學，回家。壯丁也加緊調練，每天拂曉，操塲上「一二三—四一的口號，響徹雲霄，救亡歌曲，深人民間，就是騎在牛背上的收童嘴裹也會哼出：「向前走，別退後，生死已到最後關……」的激昂而雄壯的一類歌曲。　　保甲組織得異常嚴密，彈藥前輸，傷兵後送，一切都辦得井井有條一。四月初旬，各界聯合實施國民精神總動員宣傳週，同時舉行國民公的宣誓，黨員宣誓，晚間並舉行盛大火炬遊行，軍民參加者逾數千人，悲壯熱烈，得木會有。　　現在的張渚，已成爲江南的中心了，也就是異日華軍收復東南失地的根據地啊！值得注意  郎飄然作經濟常識外匯統制  馮克昌　　外匯統制，即一國政府爲調整其國際收支，而干涉外匯，或就本國對外國之公私收支，加以適當之管理是也。嚴格之外匯統制，凡公私機關及人民收付外幣，概須經由政府特定之機關，集中處理；其統制方式，不外一方按法定價格或强制方式，收集全國所有外幣收入，一方規定於公私機關或人民需要支付外幣時，均須經特定機關加以審核，凡經核准者，均按法價供給，吾則不予供給。　　外幣收付　　按一國收入外幣之來源，不外六種：（一）出口貿易應得之代價，（二）原來保有之外幣或外幣證券，（三）海外僑民與航輪之業務收入及其他投資收入，（四）原有之外幣存款及其他債權之收回，（五）外人在國內之消費，（六）運送現金銀等。凡此諸端，在嚴格的外匯統制之下，均在應行集中之列。至於一國所需支付之外幣，其屬於正當需要者，的有五項：（一）進口貿易應付之代價，（二）其他原有外幣債務之償付，（三）駐外官員與留學生及人民赴海外旅行之費用，（四）外僑匯寄家用，（五）外商保險費及運費等。除此以外，則大多屬於資金逃避一流，即所謂不正當之需要。再在上列正當需要之中，亦尙有緩急輕重之分。凡不正當需要及非急需之外幣支付，在嚴格的外匯統制之下，均須加以限制。惟外幣收人之集中，與外幣支付之限制，其範圍既如此之廣，事實上自難免疏漏，結果乃有外匯「暗市」之成立。　　購買限制　　中國自實行新貨幣政策以來，對於外匯向取無限制買賣政策，即在「八一三」戰事發生之初，亦未嘗有何變更。直至去年三月中旬，華北成立僞「聯合準備銀行，」發行無準備不兌現鈔票，企圖掉換法幣，套取外匯，中國政府以爲倘不加以限制，法幣外匯基金，大有被其侵蝕之虞，乃開始實行限制外匯之購取：首先頒佈「購買外匯請核辦法，」規定需要購買外匯者，須先依法申請，經中央銀行核定後，按法價購取，嗣又逐漸强化，規定非必需品進口，不予供給外匯，其他私人匯款，亦定有嚴格限制辦法。至本年七月二日，又明令禁止非必需品之進口。至七月三日，更另頒「進口商品申請購買外匯規則，」廢止前頒「購買外匯請核辦法，」規定購買外匯須向一外匯審核委員會」申請，經核准者，繳山中國或交通銀行按法價售結，但申請人須繳納按法價與中交兩行外匯掛脾價格差額之平衡費。以上辦法，於調整國際收支，頗其實效，惜僅能行於內地，而握全國金融樞紐之上海則以環境特殊，未能實行耳。　　取締出口　　關於集中外幣收人一事，現已實行統制出口外匯。此項統制辦法，始於去年四月下旬，當經先後頒行「商人運貨出口及結售外匯辦法，」與「郵政包裹結售外匯辦法，」規定貨物出口，必須先將售貨應得外匯，按法價結售於中國或交通銀行，取得外匯承購證明書及關單，方可得運輸機關之承運及海關之放行，惜此辦法亦僅能行於內地，至上海出口商人所得外匯，均向高價之暗市出售，政府無法干涉，故上海一埠，中國政府事實上祇有供給進口外匯之義務，而無收入出口外匯之權利；其惟一對策，即爲减少核給進口外匯之數額，但此又適爲形成上海外匯暗市日趨活躍之因素。由於上海外匯暗市之日形擴大，影響所及，使內地出口貨因按法價結匯之故，不能與上海直接出口之貨物相競銷，中國政府爲鼓勵內地土產之出口，對於內地出口商乃訂有種種保障及補償辦法。最近於七月二日更正式頒佈「出口貨物結匯領取匯價差額辦法，」規定出口商於按法價結售外匯於中交兩行後，並得憑結匯證件，向結匯銀行領取法價與該行掛脾價格之差額。按中交兩行掛牌匯價，略長於上海暗市而短於法價，足使內地出口商减少出口之困難，此實鼓勵內地土產出口，滋生外匯收入之有效的辦法也。</p>

<p>名人軼事敝屣尊榮的溫莎公爵夫婦　　遷居巴黎新廈賽似神仙眷屬　　溫莎公爵，爲愛情而不恤犧牲王位，敝屣粵榮，世人至今傳爲美談。公爵自與辛博森夫人結褐以來，琴瑟和諧，恩愛逾恒，每恤春秋佳日，輒相偕作郊遊，登山玩水，探幽攬勝，其生活之安閒，心境之恬靜，與夫精神上之愉快，非當今身膺行政重任者流，所能夢想！公爵夫婦，誠神仙眷屬不啻也。頃悉公爵賢伉儷，業於二月間遷入巴黎新居，地點在蘇嘉路上二十四號，　近博愛河　，其崇閎壯麗，固不逮皇宮內苑，但公爵夫婦視之，却無異於仙府玉闕。再則實際上該宅寬廣雄偉，四週景物淸幽，作爲公爵夫婦起居之所，固頗適宜，該宅興建於一九二九年，爲路易十六世式，內計起居室二十問，浴室六間，一切新式設備齊全；此外並有餘屋多問，足供公爵秘書三人，私人偵探兩人，汽車司機二人，暨其餘婢僕九人居住之用。此宅並非公爵自有之產，但已訂有兩年租的。宅中餐廳，係於三月間佈置竣事，其餘各室，則遲至六月間始全部佈置就緒。此時天氣漸熱，公爵夫婦已預備離此他適，作這暑之計矣。六月十九日爲公爵夫人四十三歲生辰，後四日則爲公爵四十五歲華誕，於舉行雙慶以後，遂即前往愛勒班城。該處有溫泉一，據云泉水有療治風濕之功，夫人者番前往，或就浴焉。　　溫莎公爵蓄有愛犬三頭，殊靈馴，解人意，深得主人歡。惟其中一頭名喚「狄都」者，在不久以前，不幸爲一街車輾折一腿，雖經救治　不死，然讀腿無衛，已成殘廢。公爵夫婦每一撫視，即痛惜不置。　　新宅二樓，除廚房與伙食房外，陶薩脫與戈韋爾兩偵探之辦公室，亦設於是。三樓則爲公爵夫婦之寢室起坐室，以及富麗矞皇之客廳與宴會室。客廳內最引人注意者，厥爲其父母所賜圓形之黃金匣，匯面鍋有「給予太子愛德華」字樣神仙眷屬—公爵夫婦近影公爵呼籲和平　　－以平民資格上書義王－　　巴黎近訊：溫莎公爵，頃以平民資格，親自上書於義大利國王愛麥虞限三世，籲請運用其偉大力量，挽救歐洲戰禍，俾免生靈塗炭。原書略云：「陛下爲余所最敬佩者，昔年余曾爲一戰士追隨左右而戰，爲此余現僅以一平民之資格籲請陛下，運用旋乾轉坤之力量，以挽救此顯已迫在眉睫之慘禍」。攝生常識我之人生觀  丁福保　　吾人以境遇不同，閱歷各異，而其人生觀亦各不同。如近世少年子弟，席豐履醉生夢死，終日沈溺於遊戲晏樂之中，此不足以言人生觀。又有朝夕忙迫，刻無睱晷，仰事俯育，皆成問題，終年昏昏沈沈，爲衣食所困者，亦不足以言人生觀。又有衣食充足，作事毫無目的，無榮無辱，虛度一生，迨一棺附身，萬事都已，若是者亦不足以言人生觀。又有以謀殖財產爲人生觀者，其生時往往積財至數千百萬，迨死後則骨肉嫌猜，內江外潰，不數年間，消歸鳥有，此以積財爲人生觀之錯誤也，又有一種官迷，以做官爲人生第一職業者，詔媚百狀，自損人格。又有一種饕餮之徒，以口腹之慾爲人生第一受用者，其結果則往往引起高血壓，腎臟炎，血管變硬，早老等症，此等皆錯誤其人生觀者也。　　吾以佛氏最眞確最高尙之人生觀略述之：第一，對於一切衆生，皆作平等觀，不可有貧富貴賤寃親高下等意見存於胸中。第二，我爲救濟一切衆生，而受此身，故終身當盡力救濟社會，鞠躬縱瘁，死而後已。第三，對於已被救濟之一切衆生，不可有望報之心。凡此三端，即佛氏之所謂發菩提心也。張子西銘日：「民吾同胞，物吾與也。」又曰：「凡天下疲癃殘疾，惸獨鰥寡，皆吾兄弟之顚連而無吿者也。」亦即此旨也。本此目的而行，不可中道而廢，即積極之人生觀也。若消極之人生觀，則不足以語此。樂天養性謂壽  丁惠康　　須求精神愉快與滿足　　美滿之幸福，健康之體格，高年之生命，爲人人所希望，而精神之和平愉快與滿足，實爲達到此三者之重要基礎。一般人之心理，以爲精神之和平愉快滿足，與其個人環境大有關係，實則亦不盡然。往往有豐衣足食之人，反不能如簞食瓢飲者之多得滿足與安慰，蓋此種和平愉快滿足之精神，初不由於環境之造成，而在吾人自己之身心中，皆可注意而得之。茲略述如下：　　（一）能克制自己之情感，常保平和之情緒，即不致有趨於極端狀態之時。　　（二）平日常懷一可能之目的，而不作過奢之希望，以擾亂平靜之精神。　　（三）一日之生活，即以此一日爲惟一之目的，而專心以赴之，未來之成就，即基於此。　　（四）胸中常存博愛互助諸念，人之於我，無論愛憎絕不樂擾於心中。　　（五）人生有家庭之幸福，有交友之樂趣，有自然之流連，有琴書之欣賞，皆足發生愉快之情愫，此愉快之情愫，即爲精神和平生命健康之要素，是在吾人好自求之耳。　　從事一高尙之精神事業，如讀書習字，研究有興味之科學等，皆能使身心有所寄託，而常覺個中特有之樂趣，以愉快其精神。酷刑  郎飄然作奇聞奇事丈夫也可能買賣　　在現今男性的社會中，妻子的賣買，並不是一件稀罕的事。但是有時適得其反，丈夫也可以賣買。　　印度南部有幾處地方，女人的人口數遠過男人，因此男人便成爲珍貴的物品了，女人要想買得一個家世淸白的新郎，至少得付五百至一千盧比的身價，如果新郎人品出衆，身價就高得驚人，——有時竟須破費新娘一萬盧比之多！現今這些地方的女人，也日漸歐化，所以受過西洋教育的男人，比較容易找到顧主，身價也可以抬高，據說一個留學英國的大學學士，身價是一千盧比，如果獲得了博士學位，便可以增至二千盧比。　　不但在東方，丈夫可以賣買，便是在西方，也有不少這樣的奇事。不久以前，紐的有一個愛爾蘭人，定價三百鎊，登報出售，徵求女主顧。據說他的原配夫人，息了思鄕病，要隻身回到愛爾蘭去。他無法籌措他夫人的旅費，所以只得把自己出賣了！　　還有一個美國靑年更是異想天開，擬定了一個別緻的徵婚計劃。他要發行六十張獎券，每張售美金五十元，凡在三十二歲以下的姑娘或寡婦，都可以購買，中獎的女人，不但可以獲得道位年少郎君做丈夫，還可以得到從發售獎券而得到的三千元現金。識小録　　印度多蛇，的每七分鐘內，有爲蛇嚼死者一人。　　駝峯內積聚之脂肪，即爲駱駝所貯藏之食料。假令工作過度，或食未能飽，駝峯輒漸趨平塌。　　世人之平均壽命，迄今仍以紐絲綸爲最高，該處男子之平均年齡爲六十五歲，女子則爲六十八歲。　　美國人每年每人所食，平均爲牛肉六十二磅，糖一百〇二磅，麵粉一百七十七磅，山薯一百八十磅，牛奶九百十八磅。　　飛行最速之鳥類，每秒鐘撲翅的七十五决，翱翔時，每秒鐘的撲翅四十决。　　食物中所含有之乙種維他命，每因過分烹煮而消失。編者的話　　本刋經過短時期的籌備，終於和讀者相見了。今日雖與讀者初决相見，不過讀者也可以從這一期中，窺測本刊的一點面目。本刋雖篇幅有限，可是取材的範圍却是無所不包，上至宇宙之大，下至塵埃之微，部可在討論之列。這樣使讀者可以從這刋物中獲得各項精神的食糧。講到這點，編者又必須聲明，本刊是以大衆爲對象，故一切說理務求淺近，材料務求通俗，要使大衆讀者不但能得到、些知識，並且可以同時得到一些精神上的調劑。本刊爲達到這種目的起見，希望各界讀者多多指教，並源源供給稿件。因爲一個刊物，需要讀者的熱。督促，和作家的努力贊助，才有生氣，才有特色，希望各界讀者和作家，從今天起，能和本刊合作。婦女與家庭蔡元培夫人周養浩女士—對婦女講話　　蔡元培先生是德高望重的老教育家，是學術界唯一的領袖：談起蔡元先生，誰不肅然起敬。蔡先生的夫人周峻女士，賢能溫厚，可說是新女性的典型。在這裏，不妨先介紹蔡夫人的學歷：她早歲就讀於上海愛國女學，鎭江承志女學及啟明女墊，出校後任神州女學，安慶省立女師敎員，並在張菊生家裏任西席，服務教育，前後十餘年，民國十二年與蔡先生結婚後赴歐度蜜月，先到比國，入國立美術學院，後升巴黎美專，另就名畫家專習洋畫，她從小喜歡美術，自經名師指導，藝乃精進，最後到德國進漢堡大學，專研「民族學」，回國後便主持家政，不再出任教務。她說並非不願效勞，實在家政太繁，無暇兼顧罷了。　　蔡夫人對婦女問題，有三點切要的意見：第一提高學識，第二戒除奢華；第三勤勞耐苦。她說這三點雖似老生常談，實有顚撲不破的至理。一個女人，須先有學識，遇任何機會，方可勝任愉快，吾則即使要想和男子爭平權，提高自己的地位，也是徒勞無功的。譬如以前瑞典有位女子榮仟教育部長，法國近年亦曾有三位女閣員，其中我所知道的有一位是居禮夫人之女，她們都是學術淵博的女子，纔能造成卓越的地位，决不是僥倖心所能妄想的。愛奢華，慕虛榮，是女子最易犯的弊病，允其是生長在都市的，耳濡目染名利觀念較深，最不易解脫浮華的習氣。要知道浮華，虛榮，都不是好事情，自來都市社會，爲了它不知發生多少罪惡，釀成若干慘痛！希望女同胞意志要堅强，切勿墮入深坑。至於勤勞爲人類之美德，小則减輕男子的負担，增進家庭的幸福；大則有利於社會大衆，爲國家建設的助力，我覺得農村女子最能勞動，即以蘇州天平山而言，女子在農忙之餘，或者刺繡，或者推車抬轎，自告奮勇，一部分男子反而提着鳥籠，上茶館，飽食無事，那種情形，實非例外，各地農村，男女大概同樣勞動的。　　看過「一夜風流」鉅片，誰都稱賞手法的明快，情調的極鬆與風格的熟練。道部派拉蒙鉅片「半夜風流」，就有異曲同工之妙。主演的人物，多是有名明星，女主角克勞黛考爾白，她的俏皮與嬌憨的演技，在銀幕上已獲得廣大的觀衆。男主角就是主演「芝加哥大火記」「樂府滄桑」的唐阿曼契。的翰巴里穆亞曼麗阿絲德屈居重要配角，巴里穆亞新夫人伊蘭蓓麗，也在這部滑稽喜劇中，第一决漏臉。全片演出，充滿着幽默的　圍氣，另外紹介一種新式舞步，名字呌做“HaConga”，脫胎於古巴的土風舞，調子非常熱，將來在舞塲中，定能風行一時。上面是「半夜風流」的中題歌，音調和美，十分動聽。並由中華口琴會王慶隆君將口琴譜符號編入。該片公映日期及戲院屆時本報游藝界當有公告。科學人生醫學上的新發現　利用顯微鏡辦別病症　　巴黎法國醫學院頃宜稱，關於醫學上的辨症術，經瑞士著名化學師潘斐佛博士繼續不斷的研究，茲已有一饒有價値之新發現。按潘博士潑現的新方法，係從病人手指上取血一滴，和以氯化銅，即可變成結晶體。如係尋常無病之人，則此結晶的血液，在顯微鏡下之形狀輒爲平行綫。至於病人之血液，則每因病症之不同而各異其形狀，即如結核症之結晶血液，係「瑪拉太」空心十字架形，毒瘤症爲义角形，羊癎病爲扇子形，糖尿病則微作球形。業經千百决之試騐，絲毫不爽。故利用此法而探病人之症候，可以瞭若指掌云。</p>

<h3>Joint Anglo-French Ultimatum to Germany: Demanding a Halt to Military Aggression and Guaranteeing the Withdrawal of German Troops from Polish Territory, Otherwise Recalling Ambassadors and Implementing Aid to Poland</h3>
<p>London - British Prime Minister Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons that the British and French governments have notified Germany that if the German government is not prepared to halt all acts of aggression against Poland and provide a satisfactory guarantee for the withdrawal of German troops from Polish territory, then the two countries will, without hesitation, fulfill their commitment to aid Poland. (Reuters dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>London - The British Ambassador to Germany, Sir Nevile Henderson, visited German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop this evening, demanding a halt to the acts of aggression and ordering troops to withdraw from Polish territory. He stated that if this were not done, Britain would have no choice but to fulfill its obligations and aid Poland, and requested that the German government issue him a passport so that he could immediately return to his country. (Havas dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Paris - The French Ambassador to Germany, Robert Coulondre, visited German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop at 10 p.m. last night, demanding an immediate cessation of aggression and ordering the withdrawal of German troops from Poland. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop immediately replied that Germany was not responsible for the aggression and that he would forward the ambassador's statements to Führer Hitler for review. (Havas dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>London - Reuters diplomatic correspondent learned that as of 11 a.m. today, the British government had not yet received a response from Germany to the ultimatum that the British Ambassador to Germany, Sir Nevile Henderson, delivered to the German government yesterday. (Reuters dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>Berlin - Well-informed sources here claim that after the British and French ambassadors to Germany presented their notes to the German government last night, Germany will submit a reply in letter form today. (Haitong dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>London - After the British and French ambassadors to Germany visited German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, demanding an immediate cessation of aggression and ordering the withdrawal of German troops from Poland, no formal answer has been received as of noon today. There is also no official news on how Germany will respond. According to private sources, Foreign Minister Ribbentrop has already presented the matter to Führer Hitler for review and told the British and French ambassadors that Poland had repeatedly and resolutely violated the German border, and that the aggressor was Poland, not Germany. Political figures here consider this to be absurd, arguing instead that Germany clearly intended to invade and had provoked Poland. This can be seen from all the measures taken by the country in recent days and from the simultaneous attack by German troops on Poland in three locations. In short, if Germany does not provide a definite answer to Britain and France, the British government is determined to fulfill its accepted obligation and come to the aid of Poland. This has been repeatedly emphasized by Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax. (Havas dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Polish Government Announces Martial Law Nationwide, Military Leaders Take Control, Polish Ambassador to Germany Leaves Berlin</h3>
<p>Warsaw - The government has just declared martial law nationwide. President Mościcki has also appointed General Smigly-Rydz, Inspector General of the Armed Forces, as Commander-in-Chief of the Army, authorizing him to succeed as president in the event of a presidential vacancy. (Havas dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>Warsaw - After the Polish government declared a state of war yesterday, it placed national administrative power in the hands of the military. The Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Army, Smigly-Rydz, and senior military officers now hold supreme military and political power. In addition, it is reported that the Polish government has provided Lithuania with guarantees respecting the country's neutrality. (Haitong dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>Berlin - The Polish Ambassador to Germany, Lipski, left here this morning. Other embassy staff have not left. (Havas dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Chamberlain Warns Germany: Britain is Fully Prepared, Determined to Fulfill Guarantee Obligations, Should Hitler Remain Obstinate, He Alone Will Bear the Responsibility for the War</h3>
<p>London - Last night, British Prime Minister Chamberlain made his highly anticipated speech in the House of Commons. The most important point was his announcement that Britain and France had notified Germany that if it did not immediately cease all acts of aggression against Poland and withdraw its troops from Polish territory, then Britain and France would support Poland with all their might. If Germany's response to this warning is not satisfactory, the British Ambassador to Germany will lower the flag and return home, and we will fight with the determination to see it through to the end in a battle that we originally wished to avoid. The Prime Minister also said that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's efforts to mediate peace were admirable, but Hitler bears full responsibility for creating this catastrophe. Hitler did not hesitate to plunge the world into war in order to satisfy his unconscious ambitions. Britain has no complaints against the German people. The only fault of the German people is that they allowed themselves to be dominated by the Nazi government.</p>
<p>The House of Commons was extremely crowded, with almost no empty seats, and the public galleries were also full. When the Prime Minister and Labour Party leader Greenwood entered the chamber, there was great applause. The Prime Minister then rose to speak, and the entire chamber listened in silence.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister began by saying, "I do not intend to say much tonight. This is now a time for action, not empty words. Eighteen months ago, I had hoped that the responsibility for subjecting Britain to the terrible arbitration of war would not fall on my shoulders. Now, I fear that I will not be able to avoid this responsibility. But the circumstances regarding where my responsibility lies have never been clearer than today. I have made it clear to the German government in every way that if it must resort to force again as it has done before, then we have no choice but to resist with force. Now that all the documents have been published, we will await the judgment of history. We know that one person alone bears the responsibility for this catastrophe (applause). That is Hitler, who does not hesitate to plunge the world into disaster in order to satisfy his unconscious ambitions (applause)."</p>
<p>The Prime Minister continued that the House of Commons had not asked the government to publish information during the negotiations, and this patience was appreciated. Now, the correspondence with the German government has been published in its entirety. From this, it can be seen that Britain's aim was to promote discussions between Germany and Poland on an equal footing regarding their disputes, and to achieve a solution that would guarantee Poland's independence and be internationally guaranteed. The communique issued on August 30 contained a passage that made clear that if the German government had any intention of a peaceful resolution, then the final conflict could easily have been avoided. In this communique, the British government fully acknowledged the need to initiate discussions immediately and also recognized Hitler's concern that the two countries' troops were standing close to each other. Therefore, it argued that both sides should undertake to refrain from military action during the negotiation period. The British government was confident that if the German government gave this undertaking, the British government could obtain the same undertaking from Poland. On August 31, the Polish government replied that it was prepared to provide security on a reciprocal basis, and that Polish troops would not violate the German border during the negotiations. However, the German government did not respond to this proposal. Otherwise, why did the war break out this morning?</p>
<p>The Prime Minister went on to say that in the broadcast issued by the German side before the invasion of Poland, there was a statement that the German government, in this environment, considered its proposal to have been rejected. The Prime Minister said that the German government's proposal was not sent to Poland by Germany. On August 29, the German government still said that it intended to draw up a proposal acceptable to them in order to resolve the dispute and, if possible, submit it to the British government to await the arrival of Polish negotiators. We waited a long time for the German proposal, and the British Ambassador to Germany also strongly urged German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop to invite the Polish Ambassador to come and receive the German proposal to forward it to the Polish government. However, the German Foreign Minister spoke rudely, saying that he would never invite the Polish Ambassador to come, but that if the Polish Ambassador requested a meeting on his own initiative, the situation would be different. Seeing this situation, it seems that Germany considers Poland to be at fault because it did not negotiate with Germany on a proposal whose contents it knew nothing about. On Wednesday night, the German Foreign Minister took out a long document and read it aloud in German. The British Ambassador naturally asked for a copy, but the German Foreign Minister replied that the Polish representative had not arrived in Berlin by midnight, so it was too late. As a result, we did not receive a copy of the German proposal until last night, when we heard its contents from a broadcast in Berlin. Germany's so-called negotiators said that the Polish representative should arrive in Berlin immediately upon request and receive demands that must be accepted in their entirety. In fact, the proper course, in our view, was for this proposal to have been submitted to Poland long ago, allowing it time to consider it and allowing it to express its opinion that the German proposal was undermining the important interests of Germany that it had previously stated it respected. The Polish Ambassador met with Ribbentrop last night and told him that Poland was willing to engage in negotiations on an equal footing. Germany replied that German troops had crossed the border at dawn today and were said to have bombed various towns. In this situation, there is only one course of action available to us (applause). The British and French Ambassadors to Germany have now been ordered to send the following communication to the German government:</p>
<p>"The German Chancellor's declaration to the German Army this morning makes it clear that he will attack Poland. The British and French governments have just received information indicating that German troops have crossed the Polish border and are now engaged in an offensive. In this situation, the British and French governments feel that the German government's actions have created the following state of affairs, namely, an act of armed aggression against Poland that threatens Poland's independence. In order to fulfill the guarantees given to Poland, the British and French governments have no choice but to come to its aid. We hereby inform Your Excellency that unless the German government gives our government a satisfactory guarantee, stating that the German government will cease its acts of aggression against Poland and prepare to immediately withdraw its troops from Polish territory, our government will not hesitate to fulfill its obligations."</p>
<p>The Prime Minister continued to tell the House of Commons, "If the German government's response to this final warning is not satisfactory, then the British Ambassador has been ordered to obtain his passport from the German government. I do not think that the German government will not do so. If so, then we are all prepared." The Prime Minister then announced that all the defensive preparations taken by the British government have been published, and added, "At this moment, we must recall 1914 and compare our current position with that time. Where do we stand now? The answer is that the army, navy, and air force are all ready for battle. The situation in all aspects is more favorable and reassuring than in 1914. The most gratifying and important event seen today is that there is no need for a general appeal for conscription, such as the appeal made by Lord Kitchener twenty-five years ago." The Prime Minister then spoke of the future, saying, "We are now facing a difficult task. We will be able to draw on our past experience, so we must now do our best to organize our manpower on a systematic, just, and economical basis. Therefore, the government has immediately proposed legislation to achieve this goal. A bill will be introduced in the House of Commons that, for the sake of realism, will expand the Military Training Act, requiring all able-bodied men between the ages of 18 and 41 to serve in the military. Measures will be taken to exempt the manpower required by industry from conscription." The Prime Minister then stated that Mussolini had also done his best in the recent crisis to seek a peaceful solution. He and the government were satisfied (applause).</p>
<p>The Prime Minister concluded, "Now, we have no choice but to grit our teeth and join the battle that we have tried so hard to avoid, and with the determination to achieve our goals. We will join the battle with a clear conscience and with the aid of the Dominions and the British Empire, and with the moral approval of most of the world. We have no quarrel with the German people unless they allow themselves to be ruled by the Nazi government. As long as the Nazi government continues to exist and continues its consistent methods of the past two years, there will be no peace in Europe. We have decided that these methods must end. If we can use this battle to re-establish the rules of trust in the world and eliminate force, then even if we make sacrifices, it will be worth it." (Reuters dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<h3>French Premier Hopes Hitler Restrains Violence with Reason, Otherwise He Will Not Hesitate to Use Force to Confront It; Guarantees Provided by Germany Have No Value</h3>
<p>Paris - The Chamber of Deputies reconvened this afternoon, chaired by Speaker Herriot. Prime Minister Daladier immediately gave a speech, stating briefly, "The efforts of various countries to maintain peace were suddenly dashed by Germany. The various proposals put forward by that country, it is said, have been rejected by the government of Poland. This is a lie. In fact, Poland knows nothing about this proposal. What we value is how the German leader Hitler acts, not what he says. As for Poland, it has been an ally of our country since 1921, and the obligations we have accepted have been repeatedly strengthened. Our country and Britain have signed a mutual assistance treaty with that country, and we have no intention of abandoning it, nor can we bear to see our friendly country destroyed. The actions of Führer Hitler towards that country are another step by a dictator attempting to dominate the world. Our country is forced into this situation. Both national honor and the vital interests of national survival are involved. I dare to ask the French nation and the nations of the world, 'Since Germany has broken its promises to Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland, what value do its guarantees to our provinces of Alsace and Lorraine have?' We French people have no hatred for the German people (all members cheered), but we are also well aware that France is in a critical autumn and are willing to do our best to fight for France's survival. On the other hand, if our authorities want to take adventurous actions and implement general mobilization, the people of the whole country will never obey. At this time, our duty lies in stopping violent actions. It would be good if we could achieve this goal by peaceful means, but if the aggressor has lost his mind, then we will not hesitate to resort to force. Members of Parliament, the power to issue orders lies with France." At this point, Prime Minister Daladier expressed his respect for the noble efforts made by the Italian government to replace violence with peaceful means, saying, "If that government continues its mediation, we are prepared to support it." Prime Minister Daladier then read out President Lebrun's message, which stated briefly, "War has already broken out in Central Europe. Germany suddenly attacked Poland while negotiations were still possible. Britain and France have made every effort to stop the war, but to no avail. If the German and Polish nations still cannot listen to the call of conscience of the world, then the war will never end. As for France, it must fulfill all its obligations (all members cheered). We must unite in good faith. Long live France!" All those present cheered wildly for a long time. (Havas dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3>Who is the Culprit? Hitler Rebuts Roosevelt's Accusation Against Poland; Polish Government Declares Germany Suddenly Started the War</h3>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt telegraphed German Führer Hitler on the 25th and 26th of last month, calling for peace. The German Chargé d'Affaires, Thomsen, recently delivered a reply in the name of Führer Hitler to Secretary of State Hull. However, the wording was made by the Chargé d'Affaires himself. It said, "I have been ordered by my government to request Your Excellency to convey to Your Excellency the President that my country's leader greatly admires the two telegrams of the 25th and 26th of last month. My country's leader has made every effort to seek a friendly solution to the dispute between Germany and Poland. Even at the last minute, he accepted the mediation of the British government. Unfortunately, Poland's attitude was extremely stubborn, and all efforts have been declared a failure." (Havas dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Warsaw - The government has just issued a communique stating that Ambassador Lipski visited German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop on the evening of yesterday, the 31st, for talks and informed him that the Polish government had accepted the British offer of mediation. However, the German government announced its sixteen proposals by radio in a manner similar to the Ems Dispatch. "These demands are not acceptable to any government, and the intention of Germany in putting forward these proposals was to create an excuse to begin hostilities. This can be seen from the fact that it sent troops to invade only a few hours after putting forward the proposals. The Polish government has repeatedly stated that it is always prepared to seek a solution to the Danzig issue and the relations between Germany and Poland through mediation. It can be seen that the responsibility for the current events should be borne by Germany." As for the rumors that Polish troops had invaded the German border, they are absolutely untrue.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>European Turmoil and Italy</h3>
<p>Yesterday's discussion covered the general international situation following Germany's attack on Poland, as well as the impact on the Far East and China's War of Resistance. Today, we will focus on Italy and continue our discussion of the European situation. Before discussing the European situation, let us first mention two news items related to China, which are worth pondering despite the disruption of the overall situation. (1) The new Soviet Ambassador to China, Mr. Panyushkin, has been in Chongqing for quite some time, but various parties have kept it a secret. However, on the previous day, September 1st, it was suddenly reported that he had visited the Chairman and presented his credentials. In his speech, he made two statements: one, that Soviet aid to China's War of Resistance was not empty talk; and two, that he would take it as his responsibility to develop and strengthen cooperation between China and the Soviet Union upon taking office. Ambassadors usually make speeches upon arrival, and these speeches usually focus on fostering good relations between countries. Some even embellish them with local scenery. For example, if they come to China, they will praise the heroism and sympathy of the War of Resistance. However, the words of the new Soviet Ambassador are not as general as the usual practice. (2) The new British Ambassador to the United States, Lord Lothian, just presented his credentials. His mission is naturally between Britain and the United States. However, he gave a speech to reporters the day before yesterday, not saying anything about how things would be between Britain and the United States, but rather stating that British Far Eastern policy still adheres to the Nine-Power Treaty and that the situation has changed greatly in the past twenty-five years, and that while there was once an Anglo-Japanese alliance, there is now the Nine-Power Treaty. It should be no accident that the British Ambassador to the United States frankly discussed Far Eastern policy in his first public speech. Considering these two points, readers can be more at ease to quietly observe the evolution of the European situation!</p>
<p>When discussing the European situation, let us first recognize the facts at the current stage. By "current stage," we mean relying solely on the information obtained by the reporter at the time of writing. There are four main points: (1) German troops are attacking Poland from multiple directions. Judging from their military strategy, it seems to be based on political objectives. Therefore, their main force is approaching the Polish Corridor. (2) The German side has neither accepted nor rejected the modified Ems Dispatch that the British and French ambassadors to Germany presented to German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. (The rumors of rejection have not been confirmed by official announcements.) Therefore, the requests of the two ambassadors to sign their passports and return home should be pending. (3) US President Roosevelt has not yet recognized that a state of war has been established due to the German attack on Poland. Therefore, the Congress that needs to be convened to amend the Neutrality Act has not yet made a decision. However, while various parties indiscriminately refer to the German-Polish situation as "hostile actions," President Roosevelt refers to it as the "German invasion of Poland." This single word of criticism demonstrates the serious attitude of the United States. US Ambassador to Germany Wilson, who was on vacation in the United States, was previously rumored to be returning to his post soon, but suddenly resigned yesterday and was immediately approved. The US government not only stated that Wilson was being transferred to an important position in the State Department, but also said that it would select a new replacement and had not yet made a decision. The meaning of this is to express abhorrence. In addition, there is ample evidence that the United States sympathizes with Britain and America. (4) Italy has declared that it will not initiate military action. The future European situation may have various imagined developments or various unimaginable evolutions, but the four points mentioned above will likely be important catalysts, and readers should pay close attention to them.</p>
<p>Regarding the Italian situation, it can be said to be a new development in the recent evolution. If the German-Polish issue escalates into a European war or a world war, then Italy will inevitably be caught in the whirlpool, which goes without saying. If it does not greatly escalate, then Italy's recent actions are vaguely forming an important role in cleaning up the European situation in the near future, and it will soon be viewed with new respect by the world. Readers must remember that during the First World War, Italy betrayed its allies Germany and Austria and joined the British and French group. Of course, future events should not be inferred from historical records in a "memorization" style.</p>
<p>Five or six days ago, this newspaper discussed European affairs and pointed out the ambiguous attitudes and actions of Germany and Italy as "there must be a special purpose in the final scene of diplomacy." In the past two days, the special purpose has begun to emerge. Germany and Italy have corresponded and supported each other in international affairs, and their deeds are countless. As they advanced from the Anti-Comintern Pact to the conclusion of a military alliance, the relations between the two countries truly reached a point of sharing weal and woe. Considering its greatest goal, it is directed towards Britain and France. Now that Germany has a conflict with Poland, and Britain and France are rising up to fulfill their obligations, it is the moment when Germany and Italy should show the most affection and perform the most serious joint program of going through fire and water together. However, the German leader, at the moment when the blood debts of Britain and France are strained and the artillery fire in Poland is continuous, leisurely thanked Italy, saying that it would not bother with aid. The Italian government also declared internationally that Italy would not enter the whirlpool and would not initiate military action. Is this Germany despising Italy, or Italy betraying Germany? Is it that the two countries are on the verge of breaking up, and the military alliance is just a formality? Not so. There is a special purpose. (1) It implies to Britain and France that they do not have to fulfill their obligation to aid Poland. (2) It stabilizes the pro-Polish countries such as Turkey and Romania. (3) It shows that Germany's ambition lies in Danzig and the Polish Corridor and has no other ambitions. (4) It proves that the German-Italian axis does not want to destroy all-European peace. (5) It protects national strength, which is also to preserve the strength of the axis. (6) It makes European countries feel that a great disaster is imminent, so they all hope to reduce the scope of the disaster and avoid it. (7) It makes it nearly impossible for the anti-axis countries to deploy their lines militarily due to Italy's non-mobilization. (8) It allows Germany to have ample space behind it. Who likes war? The authorities of Germany and Italy have seen through everything and planned it thoroughly. After Ribbentrop and Ciano talked intimately, they designed this brilliant situation! Every major move by Germany shows people its unpredictable nature. It has no secrets from Italy. For example, when the Soviet Union and Germany concluded a treaty, Britain, France, and Japan were all in the dark, but Germany only told Italy. It is also well known to Italy that Germany has no intention of accepting British mediation and negotiating with Poland and has a determination to use force. However, on the eve of Germany's attack, Italy told France that it was willing to mediate, making France laugh and cry and unable to refuse. This is another aspect of the Axis' actions, like filing a case in advance before litigation. Its brilliance lies in the future. While the matter is not worth teaching, if it can shorten the time and space of European turmoil and suffering, then it is not necessary to criticize it harshly.</p>
<h3>Germany's Actions Regarding the Polish Situation Should Not Be Considered a Formal War: Statement from Authoritative Figures in Berlin; Polish Troops Bravely Resist Aggression; Fighting Still Limited to Border Areas</h3>
<p>Berlin: Authoritative figures here solemnly stated today that the military actions taken by German forces yesterday in response to Polish military attacks should not currently be considered a formal war, but rather actions triggered by Polish attacks. (2nd, Huitong Telegraph)</p>
<p>Warsaw: According to reliable sources here, the current fighting between German and Polish forces is still limited to the border areas, with no major changes. Semi-official sources state that German forces in the Malawa area have been repelled by Polish forces. Simultaneously, powerful German forces in the Deutz-Kalk area have also been intercepted by Polish forces and have made no progress. However, Polish forces attacking Danzig have made significant progress. Furthermore, a large Polish force is currently launching a determined offensive towards Silesia, southeast of East Prussia. There has been no progress in the German offensive against the Polish Corridor. Gdynia Harbor was bombed by the German Navy throughout the day yesterday, and casualties are expected to be very heavy. At 4:40 PM yesterday, German bombers came here for the seventh air raid. The Polish side responded with intense anti-aircraft fire, and Polish fighter planes also took to the air to engage, causing the German planes to leave without dropping their bombs. (2nd, Associated Press)</p>
<p>London: Polish sources in London recently stated that German forces have not broken through the Polish defense line at any point. A spokesperson stated that the Polish front line remains at the border and has not changed. (2nd, Reuters)</p>
<p>Warsaw: Fierce fighting is currently taking place within the Polish Upper Silesia province. Tank vehicles from both German and Polish armies are participating. One German armored train has been destroyed by Polish artillery, and one German aircraft has also been shot down. All the crew members have been captured. Many German soldiers have been captured in various locations along the front line. In the Danzig area, German forces attacked the Polish garrison in Westerplatte but were heavily damaged and retreated. In addition, many Polish towns and cities have been damaged as a result of German aircraft bombing. Gdynia harbor has been bombed. In total, German aircraft losses today amounted to sixteen, while the Polish side lost only two. (1st, Havas)</p>
<p>Warsaw: Officials here announced that German forces attacking Murawa on the road from East Prussia to Warsaw and Gdynia, and attacking the famous scenic spot of Zakopane from Slovakia, have all been defeated by Polish forces. German forces have begun large-scale attacks on various towns in the Polish Corridor. Polish forces captured a German armored train near Danzig and shot down seven German aircraft at Krakow and Gdynia. German bombers attempted to fly to Warsaw but were driven back. A refugee train near Sierpc was bombed, causing heavy casualties. Enemy air raids at the beginning of the war were unsuccessful. (2nd, Reuters)</p>
<p>The Hague: According to a Warsaw telegram received by the Polish Telegraph Agency, German aircraft have conducted 94 air raids on Polish towns and cities by this morning, resulting in 130 deaths, of which only 12 were soldiers, and the rest were mostly women and children. Many people were seriously injured. A hospital in Wieluń was hit by a bomb, causing a large fire. (2nd, Reuters)</p>
<p>Bombing</p>
<p>London: Residents of Warsaw witnessed a heart-stopping air battle over the city center again yesterday afternoon. Anti-aircraft fire was intense, and all kinds of air defense measures were used. According to Polish authorities, two German bombers were shot down in the battle. A Jewish refugee children's hospital was hit by a bomb and destroyed. (2nd, Reuters)</p>
<p>London: Polish sources here recently announced that the news of German aircraft flying to Warsaw twice to bomb has been confirmed. The first time was at dawn today. When the German planes attacked for the second time, the Polish government dispatched many fighter planes to intercept them. They encountered German bombers 20 kilometers from Warsaw, and an air battle immediately broke out. Many German aircraft were shot down, and the German aircraft then turned back, failing to reach Warsaw. In addition, the German army's attempts to break through the Polish army's defense line were all frustrated. The Polish position is actually at the border and remains unmoved. (1st, Havas)</p>
<p>Warsaw: Since the German army began its offensive along the entire Polish border yesterday, there has been no major progress so far. What is noteworthy is that German aircraft are bombing undefended cities, causing many casualties among innocent civilians. The Polish Army General Staff recently issued its first war report, stating, "Germany invaded our country without a formal declaration of war yesterday morning. German aircraft also bombed 15 of our cities and one railway tunnel. A train in Grotno, which was evacuating civilians, was also bombed, causing many casualties. All the churches in the city of Bydgoszcz were destroyed by bombing." (2nd, Havas)</p>
<p>London: According to the Polish Embassy here this morning, Polish cities were suddenly bombed yesterday, completely unexpectedly. Residents were unaware that the war had already broken out. According to news received from London, the German army's attack on the Polish army base in Westerplatte, Danzig, was repelled by the Polish army. According to an official from the Polish Embassy, the Polish army's heavy artillery positions put Danzig within their range, with some of them mounted on mountains outside Gdynia. The Polish government is currently broadcasting mobilization orders and evacuation orders via radio. (2nd, Reuters)</p>
<p>German War Report</p>
<p>Berlin: The first war report was issued here, stating that military operations in Silesia, Pomerania, and East Prussia have achieved the expected victories. German forces have advanced to the highlands of Katowice in the Upper Silesia region of Poland, and German forces starting from East Prussia are currently fighting within Polish territory. The German Air Force has bombed several Polish airfields and has gained air superiority. German warships also occupy some positions in the port of Danzig, and the port of Gdynia has also been bombed by German aircraft. (2nd, Reuters)</p>
<p>Berlin: The German Air Force has destroyed the Polish Kantowitz airfield. According to an army announcement, the National Socialist stormtroopers have broken through the southern Polish defense line and advanced from Neumarkt to Sega. Conflicts have also occurred on the front line of the Polish Corridor. German forces stationed in East Prussia have been fighting in Polish territory. After establishing a strong base in Marienswerder, the German army set off for Kantowitz. In addition to the Kantowitz airfield, more than 20 Polish bases have been destroyed by the German army. The military announcement denied bombing civilians and undefended cities. The announcement also declared that the German army, navy, and air force are advancing rapidly together and are approaching Kantowitz, Gleiwitz, and other industrial centers. The German ship "Schleswig-Holstein" in the Bay of Danzig has occupied the Polish armory. Westerplatte is under fire, and Gdynia has been bombed. The first official news broadcast stated, "The German army has been ordered to stop 'Polish atrocities.' The German army began its counterattack after receiving the order." The German news agency reported that Polish forces opened fire at the Berlin train station, but there was no damage. (2nd, Reuters)</p>
<p>Berlin: The High Command of the German Armed Forces announced at noon today, "German troops continued to advance on all fronts yesterday afternoon and continued to progress this morning, overcoming the Jablonka Pass. The Air Force dispatched planes to bomb Polish airfields, destroying many enemy aircraft." (2nd, Huitong Telegraph)</p>
<h3>Peace Movement Resurges; Italian Foreign Minister Meets with Envoys from Various Countries; France Expresses Acceptance of Italian Mediation; Britain Welcomes Italy's Decision Not to Participate in the War</h3>
<p>Rome: Foreign Minister Ciano recently met separately with envoys from various countries, including British Ambassador Sir Percy Loraine, French Ambassador François Poncet, American Ambassador William Phillips, Polish Ambassador Władysław Grzybowski, and German Ambassador Hans Georg von Mackensen. (2nd, Havas)</p>
<p>Paris: Officials recently announced that the Italian government had yesterday proposed to the French and other governments a way to resolve the current European dispute. After consideration, the French government has submitted a positive response to Italy. (1st, Havas)</p>
<p>Paris: The French government announced last night that it has accepted Italy's proposal in principle to convene a five-power conference to resolve the German-Polish problem. France's future actions will depend on the outcome of the Anglo-French demand that German troops withdraw from Polish territory. (2nd, Associated Press)</p>
<p>London: The Times' Rome correspondent recently reported that since German leader Adolf Hitler has telegraphed Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini, asking him not to provide military assistance, the Italian cabinet has also decided to avoid getting involved in the war vortex. There is much commentary here, and many believe that Italy's move is almost a declaration that regardless of whether Britain and France take hostile action against Germany, Italy should maintain neutrality. Or perhaps the Italian cabinet made this decision after understanding the positions of Britain and France, so that the country will not collude with Germany as long as it is not attacked by the democratic countries (diplomatic circles here believe that the democratic countries will never attack Italy), but some also believe that Italy has not completely abandoned its axis policy. The decision taken is intended to leave room for maneuver. However, the general public believes that Italy's current attention is focused on Albania and Abyssinia, completing military preparations as soon as possible, and then observing the situation. In short, whatever the explanation for the decision taken by the Italian cabinet yesterday, it is deeply welcomed by the general public here. (2nd, Havas)</p>

<h3>President Roosevelt Scheduled to Deliver a Speech Today; America Will Not Be Drawn into the War Vortex; Outcome of European Situation Will Be Clear in a Few Days</h3>
<p>Washington: President Roosevelt told reporters this morning, "I not only sincerely hope that the United States can avoid being drawn into the European war vortex, but I also believe that we can stay out of it. The government will also make every effort to avoid being drawn into the vortex." The President also announced the resignation of Wilson, the US Ambassador to Germany. Some political circles see this as an indication that the United States intends to sever diplomatic relations with Germany. Secretary of State Hull was also present when the President met with journalists. One person's attitude was serious. The President pointed out that the current situation is the most serious in history. The President convened Army Secretary Woodring, Acting Navy Secretary Edison, Army Chief of Staff Johnson, and Army Chief of Staff Stark last night, and senior officials of the Treasury Department also met until dawn before dispersing. (2nd, Associated Press)</p>
<p>Washington: President Roosevelt recently told the press that the evolution of the European situation will be clear in the next few days, and the US position at that time should also be determined. He hopes that public opinion will use common sense, remain calm, and help him cope with the current situation. When publishing news, newspapers must strive to be accurate and based on what has been confirmed by the White House, the State Department, or various departments, so that public opinion will not be misled or cause unnecessary panic. In short, at a time when civilization is under threat, we need cooperation from all walks of life to enlighten public opinion. As far as American action is concerned, I intend to wait for the European situation to be completely clarified before convening a special session of Congress and amending the current Neutrality Act to ensure complete security. In short, for the sake of American interests at this moment, it is best to remain silent and watch the situation. I hope that the newspapers will understand this meaning, and be cautious when publishing. A reporter asked whether the United States could avoid being drawn into the war vortex. The President replied that he not only hoped so, but also believed that it would not be difficult. The government will devote all its efforts to this in the future. The President also said that Wilson, the US Ambassador to Germany, has not returned to his post since returning to the country this spring and has recently submitted his resignation. The government has decided to approve it and transfer him to an important position in the State Department. As for the vacancy of the Ambassador to Germany, it has not yet been decided whether to replace him. It is also rumored that Secretary of State Hull has ordered all domestic ships to return to domestic ports. This statement is not accurate, which shows that there are many rumors outside, and newspapers should be cautious when publishing them. In addition, when the German President mentioned the hostile actions between Germany and Poland, he used the word "invasion" of Poland by the German army. All observers paid close attention to this point. (1st, Havas)</p>
<p>Washington: Political circles here now believe that the opportunity to amend the current Neutrality Act as soon as possible to help the democratic countries fight has greatly increased. They are currently discussing electing President Roosevelt for a third consecutive term to prevent the United States from being drawn into the war. It is too early to say that the neutral sentiment has changed, but clear movements have indeed shown signs. All parties now clearly express sympathy for the democratic countries, so sooner or later it will lead to political action. The determination not to send American troops to the European war has never been as strong as it is today, but the public feels that it can provide great assistance to the democratic countries within the scope of the Neutrality Act. The Roosevelt government is determined to ask Congress to approve this move and is determined to succeed. (2nd, Reuters)</p>
<p>Washington: It is widely rumored here that if the European war breaks out, President Roosevelt will request a special session of Congress to allocate 10 billion US dollars for military preparations. Government officials refuse to discuss whether this is possible. (2nd, Associated Press)</p>
<p>Washington: President Roosevelt's secretary, Early, recently announced that the President did not sleep all night last night due to the tense European situation. Tonight, he ordered the State Department personnel that if a major incident occurs, they should get up and work even late at night, and then return to the White House to rest. In addition, President Roosevelt is scheduled to deliver a radio speech at 9 pm on the 3rd of this month, which will be broadcast to European countries by the three major American radio stations. This speech will contain instructive content and explain the position taken by the American government. (1st, Havas)</p>
<h3>America Calls for No Bombing of Civilians; Five Countries Respond with Approval</h3>
<p>Washington: Secretary of State Hull announced that Britain and France have agreed to President Roosevelt's call not to bomb civilians. The British reply stated that bombing is limited to military targets, which is Britain's fixed policy, but requires the enemy to also carefully comply. (2nd, Reuters)</p>
<p>Washington: Polish Ambassador Potocki submitted a reply to Secretary of State Hull this evening, which stated, "The Polish government received President Roosevelt's telegram. His benevolent words are beneficial and deeply appreciated. The principles on which this move is based are deeply supported by our government. Our highest military authorities have already ordered the Air Force to act accordingly based on these principles. Unfortunately, our territory has been invaded by German troops without cause since this morning, and the Air Force of that country has repeatedly bombed us. In this way, the order issued by our highest military authorities based on humanitarian considerations must be conditional on the other party also being able to effectively comply." (1st, Havas)</p>
<p>Washington: After President Roosevelt telegraphed the governments of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Poland, urging them not to use aircraft to bomb undefended cities, British Ambassador Lord Lothian delivered a reply from his government to the President, which stated, "We greatly admire your Excellency's appeal, advocating that aircraft not be used to bomb innocent civilians in undefended cities. The government has already established a policy that it will avoid using this method of warfare when forced to be drawn into the war in the future, but on the condition that the enemy can also adhere to the same restrictions." In addition, Italian Ambassador Suvich orally submitted a response to President Roosevelt, saying that the Italian Cabinet meeting had decided in the afternoon to stay out of the war. Therefore, the Italian government believes that President Roosevelt's appeal is not relevant to that country. According to the President's issuance of this telegram, the governments of Poland and Britain and France have replied in favor, and the Italian reply has been as mentioned above. Only the German government has not yet submitted an answer. (1st, Havas)</p>
<p>Berlin: US President Roosevelt appealed to all countries that may participate in the war, requesting them to publicly declare that they would never use the Air Force to bomb the people and undefended cities. Hitler has replied by telegram, which has been delivered by the US Chargé d'affaires, and the full text is as follows: Your Excellency's advocacy of respecting humanitarianism and not bombing non-military objects coincides with my views. Therefore, I unconditionally express my support, requesting all countries to jointly and publicly declare that, in addition to what I have repeatedly stated in my speech to Congress, I have today ordered the Air Force to limit itself to military objectives, but on the condition that the other party also complies with the same principles.

<h3>Molotov's Diplomatic Report on the Process of the German-Soviet Pact</h3>
<p>(Continued from yesterday) I will now continue to discuss the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact. The initial decision to conclude this pact between the Soviet Union and Germany was made after the Anglo-French-Soviet military negotiations reached a stalemate due to the aforementioned insurmountable disputes. We, because the negotiation process showed that the conclusion of a mutual assistance pact was hopeless, had to explore other possible ways to safeguard peace and eliminate the crisis of German-Soviet war. If the British and French governments are unwilling to consider this, they are free to do so. Our responsibility is to consider the interests of the Soviet people and the Soviet Socialist Federal Republic (sustained applause), allowing it to be because we explore the interests of the Soviet Union, which are in line with the fundamental interests of the peoples of all countries (applause). "This is still one aspect of the issue. In addition, if the Soviet Union and Germany want to establish a non-aggression pact, Germany must adopt an attitude of good neighborliness with the Soviet Union in its foreign policy. After the establishment of this second condition, that is, after we know that the German government is indeed willing to change its foreign policy, thereby improving relations with the Soviet Union, the foundation for the establishment of a non-aggression pact between the two countries will be laid. "Everyone knows that for six years, since the National Socialist Party took power, German-Soviet political relations have been in a state of tension. Everyone also knows that although the two countries have different positions and political systems, the Soviet government will still strive to maintain normal commercial and political relations with Germany. All of you are aware of the various independent events that have occurred in these types of relations in recent years, which do not need to be detailed again now. What I must point out is the explanation of our foreign policy in the 18th Congress of our Party a few months ago.</p>
<p>When Stalin mentioned the tasks of our foreign policy, he explained our country's attitude towards all countries as follows: First, continue the policy of peace and strengthen business relations with all countries; second, be cautious at all times and prevent our country from being introduced into conflicts by warmongers who are good at exploiting others' troubles." (Excitement) In this way, Stalin had already declared that the Soviet Union advocated strengthening business relations with all countries. At the same time, Stalin warned us not to be exploited by warmongers who were trying to cause conflicts between our country and other countries for their own interests. Stalin also exposed the truth about the "plans of the German occupation of Soviet Ukraine" in the newspapers of Britain, France, and the United States, saying, "The purpose of this suspicious clamor seems to be to provoke the Soviet Union against Germany, poisoning the air and unreasonably provoking Germany." Here, Stalin thoroughly exposed the conspiracy of Western European politicians who were trying to provoke German-Soviet conflict. But we must admit that even in our country, there are short-sighted people who are caught up in overly simple anti-fascist propaganda and forget this provocation by the enemy. Stalin, taking this into account, mentioned the possibility of establishing good neighborly relations between Germany and the Soviet Union at that time.</p>
<p>Now we know that Germany has, on the whole, correctly understood Stalin's aforementioned declaration, thereby drawing practical conclusions (laughter). The conclusion of the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact shows that Stalin's historical foresight has been fully confirmed. In the spring of this year, the German government suggested to our country that it reopen negotiations on commercial credit. Soon these negotiations were reopened. After the two sides made concessions to each other, the two countries reached an agreement and signed it on August 19. The signing of this agreement between Germany and the Soviet Union was not a preliminary decision. But this agreement is not only different from the agreement of 1935, but it is also more favorable compared with all past agreements, even any economic agreements concluded between our country and Britain, France, or any country. The advantage is that the credit period is as long as seven years and that it gives our country the opportunity to order a large amount of necessary equipment. The Soviet side is also willing to sell a certain amount of surplus raw materials to Germany for its industry. This is also in line with our country's interests. How can we reject such a favorable economic agreement? Is it to curry favor with those who do not want the Soviet Union to establish favorable economic agreements with other countries? Moreover, this agreement is not only suitable for our country's economic and national defense interests, but also in line with Stalin's declaration on the need to "strengthen business relations with all countries," which was passed by the 18th Congress of our Party. When the German government expressed its willingness to improve political relations, the Soviet government had no reason to refuse. Therefore, the issue of establishing a non-aggression pact arose. The current uproar from all sides is enough to prove that they do not understand the simple rationale for the improvement of German-Soviet political relations that is now beginning. For example, some people ask in a confused manner, how can the Soviet Union agree to improve political relations with a fascist-type country? But they forget that this is not our issue of the internal political system of other countries, but the issue of diplomatic relations between the two countries. They forget that our advocacy is non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, and at the same time, we do not allow other countries to interfere in our internal affairs (to be continued)</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Replaces its Ambassador to Germany</h3>
<p>Moscow: The Soviet government has recently appointed Shkvartsev as the Ambassador to Germany. It is said that Shkvartsev will go to Berlin soon to take office. The former Ambassador to Germany, Merekalov, has been transferred back for other assignments. (2nd, Huitong Telegraph)</p>
<p>Washington: A very reliable government official told the Associated Press reporter, based on confidential information from London and Paris, that there is a one in a million chance that Britain and France will declare war on Germany today. If war is formally declared, President Roosevelt will definitely convene a special session of Congress, the most likely date being Sunday. (2nd, Associated Press)</p>
<h3>British Government Announces Details of Negotiations with Germany</h3>
<p>London - A detailed account of Britain's efforts to avert the crisis at the end of August is provided in the White Paper published here today. It contains the recent exchange of documents between London and Berlin. In its reply to Germany on August 28, Britain suggested direct discussions between Poland and Germany, with Poland's permission. Germany was notified that Poland was prepared to enter into direct discussions with Germany immediately. Germany was expected to deliver a written response the following day (August 29) to the British Ambassador in Germany, Henderson. The wording of the response, besides making far-fetched claims about the various facts that led to this crisis, demanded that Poland send a plenipotentiary to Berlin by August 30. The second British response was delivered to the German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop at midnight on August 30. The German side then issued a lengthy document in reply, which was apparently the sixteen-point plan published by Germany. When British Ambassador Henderson requested the original text of this proposal from the German Foreign Minister, he was told that because the Polish envoy had failed to arrive in Berlin by midnight, it was now too late. After hearing about these developments, Poland informed Britain on the afternoon of August 30 that it would authorize its ambassador in Berlin, Lipski, to announce that Poland accepted Britain's proposal for negotiations. The German Foreign Minister did not receive the Polish ambassador until the evening of August 31. After the meeting, the German side broadcast its proposal over the radio. The Polish ambassador wanted to establish contact with Warsaw immediately, but all traffic between Poland and Germany had been blocked by Germany, so he was unable to do so. The British publication of the correspondence begins with a letter from British Prime Minister Chamberlain to Hitler on August 26, on behalf of the British government. The letter first outlines the precautionary measures Britain had begun to take and states that, in the British government's view, because of repeated rumors of German military action, and because some in Berlin believed that the announcement of the German-Soviet pact might indicate that Britain's intervention on behalf of Poland was no longer possible, it was necessary to take precautionary steps. Nothing could be more wrong. Whatever the nature of the German-Soviet pact, it could not change Britain's obligations to Poland, which the British government had repeatedly and clearly stated its determination to fulfill. The Prime Minister solemnly declared that the British government did not want others to misunderstand its attitude, and he cited his remarks in the House of Commons on August 24, stating that in the event of an incident, Britain was determined to immediately use all its forces to intervene. The Prime Minister concluded by saying, "I have made a very clear statement of the position in which Britain stands. I firmly believe that if war were to break out between Britain and Germany, it would be a great disaster for the world. I dare say that the peoples of both countries do not wish it to be so. I believe that the problem between Poland and Germany, if both sides can restore trust and discuss openly and honestly with each other, there is no reason why it cannot be resolved peacefully. We are ready at any time to create an environment so that these negotiations can proceed, and at the same time, we can discuss broader issues affecting future international relations, including all matters relating to Britain and Germany."</p>
<p>Hitler replied to Britain on August 23, stating that Germany had certain real interests that it could not abandon, but that these interests did not exceed the limits prescribed by Germany's previous history and were based on significant economic needs. Regarding the issue of Danzig and the Polish Corridor, Hitler blamed Britain's guarantee to Poland for the acts of terror perpetrated by Poland against 1.5 million Germans. Hitler concluded by saying that the countries that must bear the responsibility for the Treaty of Versailles must change their spirit, and then relations between Britain and Germany could improve.</p>
<p>When Hitler met with British Ambassador Henderson on August 25, he also spoke about the speeches made by British Foreign Secretary Halifax and British Prime Minister Chamberlain in Parliament on August 24. He said that the British claim that Germany intended to conquer the world was ridiculous. Hitler also said that he was prepared and determined to contact the British side again with greater and broader conditions after the German-Polish issue was resolved.</p>
<p>Britain replied to Hitler's letters and conversations of August 23 and 25 on August 28, pointing out that the suggestions made by Hitler regarding the relationship between Britain and Germany were of the most common form, but that if the Polish-German issue could be resolved peacefully, the British government was prepared to accept and discuss it. The next step should be direct negotiations between Germany and Poland, and that Britain had now obtained a firm guarantee from Poland, expressing that it was prepared to engage in discussions with Germany based on protecting Poland's major interests and achieving a solution through international guarantees. A fair resolution of the Polish-German issue could open the path to world peace.</p>
<p>Hitler handed the reply to Ambassador Henderson on August 29, stating the various military actions of Poland, and the many acts of aggression by Poland against the Free City of Danzig, and stating that the Germans within Poland were being subjected to Polish abuse. Germany had tolerated this for months, and now had no choice but to take necessary measures to protect Germany's interests. Germany no longer believed that the dispute between Germany and Poland could be resolved through direct negotiations, but since Britain had made this proposal, Germany was willing to give it a try.</p>
<p>Among the correspondence released by the British side were several telegrams from the British government to Ambassador Henderson in Germany, stating that while Britain attached importance to the urgency of the current situation, it considered Germany's demand that a Polish envoy must arrive in Berlin by midnight to be unreasonable. In the final telegram, Britain suggested that Germany should follow diplomatic custom, and after the proposal was ready, invite the Polish ambassador to come and deliver it to Warsaw.</p>
<p>The British side then delivered a reply to Hitler's note of August 29 to the German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop at midnight on August 30, stating that Britain would give full consideration to the conditions proposed by Germany for the resolution of the Polish issue, and believed that it was necessary to begin this discussion quickly, and further advocated a temporary maintenance of the status quo for Danzig.</p>
<p>The final piece of correspondence released was a note from the German government to the British ambassador, stating that the Polish plenipotentiary had not yet arrived, causing Germany to wait for two days, and listing the German sixteen-point plan. (Reuters telegram from the 2nd)</p>

<p>Oslo, Norway - The government has recently issued an order to mobilize a batch of reserve soldiers to strengthen the army's strength, so that it can defend the country's neutral status when necessary. In addition, naval reservists have also received mobilization orders, and the strength of the coastal patrol fleet has also been supplemented. (Havas telegram from the 1st)</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden - The cabinet held a meeting this afternoon and decided to step up the adoption of defensive measures.

<p>Rio de Janeiro, Brazil - Brazilian Foreign Minister Aranha declared that the Brazilian government is paying close attention to the crisis in Europe and predicts that peace can be preserved. Brazil hopes that not only Brazil will remain neutral, but that all of the Americas will remain neutral. Aranha asked the people of the country to remain calm and not to act rashly. (Haitong telegram from the 2nd)</p>
<p>Geneva - Since France guaranteed to respect Swiss neutrality, people here believe that all rumors about Switzerland being threatened by war have lost their effect. The Swiss Federal Council has repeatedly stated in recent days that if anyone disrespects Switzerland's neutrality, Switzerland will respond with force. After the general mobilization order issued yesterday is fully implemented, Switzerland will have a standing army of 450,000 men to defend its borders. Yesterday, thousands of soldiers said goodbye to their parents, wives, or lovers and left with high spirits. It is expected that all borders will be closed by late at night. As of last night, the government had not yet notified the people to prepare for evacuation. (Haitong telegram from the 2nd)</p>
<p>Warsaw - General Smigly-Rydz, Commander-in-Chief of the Army, recently issued a proclamation to the army, saying, "Soldiers of the Polish nation, our country's long-standing enemy invaded and attacked the borders of the Polish Republic on September 1. The time has come for us to fulfill our responsibilities. All our soldiers should fight for the survival and future of Poland. Every step the enemy takes must be paid for with a large amount of blood. What our country advocates is just and righteous, and it is also what God advocates. All soldiers should trust in it, and fulfill their duties with the greatest sacrifice, and preserve their honor. No matter how long the war lasts, our country and its allies will surely win the final victory. The Polish Republic has been attacked by Germany, and this is a fact that is of the utmost importance, and the number of figures cannot diminish it. Germany has already invaded our territory, and has also sent planes from afar to bomb at will, which should be recognized by everyone. Our country did not know anything about the sixteen proposals made by Germany, until the German radio station broadcast the full text on the evening of August 31. This kind of demand is forcing our country to abandon its life, and it is definitely not something our country can accept. Germany also knows this, and that is why it immediately resorts to coercion. As for the bombing of our country's cities by German planes, the intention is to threaten the civilians, but it has no effect. The people will never panic, and they will come out of the shelters during the bombing to watch the aerial combat, and applaud to encourage our country's pilots to bravely shoot down the invading country's planes. The people's morale is extremely high, and this can be seen from this. (Havas telegram from the 2nd)</p>
<p>The stock market will open on schedule on Monday. Except for foreign exchange and Liverpool wheat, all other markets will be closed today. (Reuters telegram from the 2nd)</p>
<p>Paris - The French government's general mobilization order was posted at 6 pm last night, stipulating that midnight yesterday was the time for 6 million people to continue enlisting. The mobilization order brought the total number of French armed forces to 8 million. (Associated Press telegram from the 2nd)</p>
<p>Paris - Although the situation is extremely serious after the outbreak of hostilities between Germany and Poland, the scene in Paris has not changed in reality, which makes people more excited about the greatness of Paris. However, there are more people wearing uniforms on the streets than usual, and the guard teams in front of various departments and agencies have presented a wartime scene. More generally speaking, the citizens are as calm as ever, and passers-by mostly stand on the street to watch the mobilization bulletin. Various transportation engineers have been reduced, so citizens are competing to hire business cars to replace them. The stations are very crowded, but because the railway authorities handle it properly, the order is in good order, and passengers do not have the pain of waiting for a long time and not being able to get on the bus. Everything in daily life is as usual. The citizens not only have no anxiety or disappointment, but also have a firm attitude and are extremely calm. What is most noteworthy is the long kiss when the conscripts leave to bid farewell to their wives, children or lovers at the station. (Havas telegram from the 1st)</p>

<h3>Chinese Army Sweeps Away Japanese Troops Around Changzhi, Recovers North Bao Dian Town in Changzi, Over 100 Japanese Soldiers Killed</h3>
<p>Luoyang - The battle around Changzhi is becoming increasingly fierce. After days of fierce attacks by the Chinese army, the Japanese troops are extremely panicked. In addition to thoroughly sweeping away the scattered units of the Japanese army around Changzhi, the Chinese army has also changed its strategy, concentrating its forces to launch fierce attacks on the Kou Kou area. Changzi and Changzhi were originally in a mutually supportive position. The Japanese army has recently been actively building roads to seek contact and to relieve the siege of Changzhi. The six to seven hundred Japanese troops in Nanhetou Village, south of Changzi, along with three or four cannons, advanced on the Chinese army on the 29th, but were bravely repelled by the Chinese army, and took the opportunity to attack the Japanese army in victory. On that day, Shibei Bo (west of Changzi) was recovered. On the 30th, it had advanced to the Changzhang Village · Peijiazhuang area and launched a fierce attack on the Japanese army. In addition, the Chinese army × unit attacked the Kou army in Baodian (north of Changzi) again on the 29th. The Japanese army stubbornly resisted, but after a fierce charge and a half-day battle by the Chinese army, more than 100 Japanese soldiers were killed. By the evening, the Japanese army was defeated and Baodian Town was recovered. The remnants fled eastward. Baodian Town is an important stronghold north of Changzi, connecting the traffic between Changzi and Tunliu. Now that it has been captured by the Chinese army, Changzi has lost its barrier, and it should be recovered in the short term. And Changzhi, the isolated city, is in an increasingly difficult situation, and the Chinese army will have new progress in the coming days. (Telegram from the 1st)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Guangzhou Heavily Guarded</h3>
<p>Guangzhou - Japanese soldiers with loaded rifles and bayonets inspected all pedestrians on Sha Ji Road yesterday, preventing entry and exit from the side roads. This restriction lasted from 1 pm to 3 pm. The curfew implemented in the early morning was not lifted until 7:15 pm. It is said that the Japanese army took this action because many bandits have recently been found on Sunan Island (translation) across the river from this city. (Reuters telegram from the 2nd)</p>
<h3>Ling County, Puppet Troops Mutiny</h3>
<p>Xi'an - Military news, the puppet security team in Ling County, northern Shandong, with over 100 men and guns each, recently mutinied because they were unwilling to be oppressed by the Japanese army. After repeated negotiations and support, on the night of the 16th, the Chinese army sent a team to monitor the stronghold and cut off traffic. At the same time, they led the team into the city. The puppet troops, led by Zhang Wenzeng, mutinied en masse and captured the puppet regiment commander Fan Shujian, the puppet finance section chief Rong Jianting, the puppet team leaders Chen Yushan, Du Huaide, Wang Xixian, the puppet quartermaster Yao Yuxiu, the puppet patrol officer Men Ziqing, the puppet police chief Su Xiufeng, and a total of 15 soldiers. Only the puppet county magistrate escaped alone. That night, more than a dozen puppet troops stationed in Sunlujia (5 li east of Ling County) mutinied, with more than 30 guns.

<h3>Remains of Japanese Plane Found at Tongxingchang</h3>
<p>Chongqing - It has been learned that the tail of a Japanese plane was found in Tongxingchang, north of Ciqikou. The local Baojia head has reported it to the superiors, and people have been sent to transport it to Chongqing. According to the air battle on the 28th of last month, the Chinese Air Force chased a Japanese plane over the northwestern suburbs of Chongqing, and one plane was shot down, but it could not be found for a while. The location where the plane tail was found is consistent with the location of the air battle that day, so it is judged that the plane tail may be part of the wreckage of the Japanese plane shot down by the Chinese army that day. (Telegram from the 2nd)</p>
<h3>Even if a Major War Breaks Out in Europe, the Source of Chinese Military Fire Will Never Be Exhausted, Chongqing Officials Are Mostly Optimistic</h3>
<p>Chongqing - The intellectuals and officials here have a lot of speculation about the European war, and they are willing to pay attention to its impact on the Far East. However, the general view of officials is mostly optimistic, because China has accumulated a large amount of foreign military fire and military supplies so far, which is enough for a very long period of application. At the same time, foreign military fire and various military supplies are still coming in steadily. The Chinese side believes that even if a major war breaks out, German military fire can still come to China via the Northwest Railway, because China produces tungsten, and Germany needs tungsten to manufacture military fire, so it cannot but exchange military fire for China's tungsten sand. In the past, Germany and Japan had a anti-communist public, but in order to obtain China's tungsten sand and other raw materials, they still had to conclude a barter agreement with China. Now, the anti-communist public has become waste paper. In order to obtain the tungsten sand necessary for manufacturing military fire, Germany must continue to export military fire to China. However, the supply of military fire and military supplies from European countries to Japan will stop from now on, because all countries must use it for their own purposes. As for the diplomatic aspect, China's position is stronger than Japan's. On the eve of the outbreak of the European war, Japan lost all its friendly countries, but China not only maintained its old friendly countries, but also gained new friendly countries. For example, in the past ten days, the relationship between China and Germany has greatly increased, which can greatly help each other. According to Chinese dignitaries, it is expected that Japan will soon seek peace with China, and at this time China will put forward 21 conditions to Japan. However, as far as the general public is concerned, the Chinese are indeed sympathetic to Poland. (Associated Press telegram from the 2nd)</p>
<h3>Chongqing People Pay Attention to European War News</h3>
<p>Chongqing - The news of the German-Polish war was shocking. Chinese and foreign residents flocked to radio receivers to listen to the latest broadcasts from London, Berlin, and other places. European news is now the focus of attention for everyone, even causing the Sino-Japanese War to quietly take a decisive position. Last night, all Chinese newspapers printed extra editions, announcing European war news. The political circles did not want to make comments on this incident. A Reuters reporter sought opinions from all parties. Most Chinese expressed sympathy for Britain and Poland. Although all Chinese circles criticized Hitler's policy of aggression, they expressed great affection for the people of the General State. It is said that the National Government will announce a public policy on the European War in the coming days. Reuters has learned that if the European War officially breaks out, the National Government seems to announce its support for Britain. (Reuters telegram from the 2nd)</p>
<h3>Mongolian Border War is Fierce, Soviet-Mongolian Allied Forces Issue Battle Report: Japanese "Manchukuo" Troops Completely Eliminated in Mongolian Territory</h3>
<p>Moscow - The command of the Mongolian People's Republic's Soviet-Mongolian Allied Forces recently issued the following communique: From August 5 to 17, only small teams of sentries from the Soviet-Mongolian forces and the Japanese "Manchukuo" forces encountered each other in the area east of the Khalkhin Gol. The Japanese air force repeatedly attempted to cross into Mongolian territory, but were repelled by the Soviet-Mongolian air force. 31 Japanese planes were shot down, while the Soviet-Mongolian side lost only 7. On August 17, after gathering a large number of reinforcements, the Japanese "Manchukuo" army began to advance towards the Soviet-Mongolian army's front line on the east bank of the Khalkhin Gol, 6 kilometers from the river, attempting to occupy several important heights. These attacks were repelled by the Soviet-Mongolian army until the 19th. The Japanese "Manchukuo" army was finally forced to retreat to its original line and adopt a defensive posture. From August 20, the Soviet-Mongolian army, with air force cover, launched a major offensive on the entire front line on the east bank of the Khalkhin Gol. As a result, from August 21 to 28, the Japanese "Manchukuo" army was completely surrounded on both wings. After inflicting great losses on them in manpower and equipment, they began to eliminate them. Although small teams of remnants of the Japanese "Manchukuo" army attempted to counterattack, they were all crushed by the Soviet-Mongolian army. By the night of August 28 and 29, these remaining Japanese "Manchukuo" troops entrenched in the territory of the Mongolian People's Republic had been completely eliminated. The Soviet-Mongolian army thus advanced completely to the national border and established a strong front line. As a result of this major elimination, the Japanese "Manchukuo" army suffered extremely heavy losses. 294 soldiers of the 14th National Infantry of the "Manchukuo" First Mixed Brigade automatically surrendered with their weapons, led by their officers. The spoils captured by the Soviet-Mongolian army included 5 155mm caliber guns, 7 150mm guns, 12 105mm guns, 3 122mm guns, 50 75mm guns, 67 37mm guns, a total of 144 guns, 67 heavy machine guns, 98 light machine guns, 26 mortars, 9,000 rifles, 12,000 rounds of various calibers, 8 tanks, 8 armored vehicles, 14 tractors, 68 trucks, and 10 passenger cars. The Japanese air force tried to help the surrounded troops with a desperate fight, but the results were extremely tragic. Between August 20 and 27, a total of 164 planes were shot down by the Soviet-Mongolian air force, including 123 fighters, 36 bombers, and 5 multi-seat command planes. At the same time, the Soviet-Mongolian air force lost only 16 planes. On August 28, another 11 Japanese planes were shot down, with no Soviet-Mongolian losses. On the 29th, 8 Japanese planes were shot down, and the Soviet-Mongolian air force lost one plane. On the 30th, 21 Japanese planes were shot down, and the Soviet-Mongolian losses were only one plane.

<p>Nuomonhan - The Japanese troops are now preparing to launch a major offensive against the Soviet army. There were continuous fierce battles between the Japanese and Soviet armies today. This is only six miles away from the Japanese front line. If you look far with binoculars, you can see the Japanese planes flying in the anti-aircraft fire line. In addition, the Japanese artillery near here sometimes bombards the Soviet positions. When the reporter came here from Hailar, he saw hundreds of Japanese military trucks on the way, rushing forward, full of Japanese soldiers and anti-aircraft guns, heavy artillery, kerosene, and other military supplies. Yesterday, Soviet planes were exceptionally active, so the Japanese trucks had to stop on the way and wait for the arrival of dusk. At that time, it was no more than 50 miles away from the Japanese front line. Last night, the moon was bright and the wind was clear, which was suitable for aircraft to conduct night reconnaissance, so the Japanese trucks accelerated forward between midnight yesterday. (Soviet planes were still quite active at midnight.) Now the reporter is living in a Japanese military tent, and there are four wounded soldiers outside the tent being treated by doctors. Yesterday, the reporter saw 30 trucks, full of lightly wounded Japanese soldiers, rushing towards Hailar. Most of the trucks used by the Japanese army are American products.

<h3>Tianjin's Four Chinese Nationals Still Not Extradited</h3>
<p>Tianjin: According to news received here today, Japanese and puppet officials today visited the British consulate to discuss the extradition of the four Chinese nationals. The British consul stated that he was acting under instructions from the British government and that the four Chinese nationals could not be extradited at this time. It is reported that British Consul Jameson had previously informed the Japanese and puppet authorities that he had received the four Chinese nationals, but Judge Jones of the British Supreme Court in Shanghai, in response to requests from various circles for habeas corpus, had agreed to conduct a second inquiry into the reasons for the detention of the four Chinese nationals and had scheduled a hearing for November. He has now telegraphed the British authorities in Tianjin to inquire about the reasons. However, according to a Japanese military spokesman, the Japanese side's concern is not the four Chinese nationals but the silver in the British Concession in Tianjin.

<h3>Toshio Shiratori Recalled to Japan</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Japanese Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Abe today ordered the recall of Japanese Ambassador to Italy, Toshio Shiratori. It is said that his successor will be formally appointed soon. According to political circles, Shiratori's recall is due to poor health and he intends to return home for recuperation. However, many foreigners believe that Shiratori was a staunch advocate of Japan joining the German-Italian military alliance. Since the formation of the new cabinet, there has been a significant change in Japan's foreign policy, so there is no other way but to recall Shiratori. It is also said that Shiratori was extremely disappointed with the establishment of the Soviet-German military alliance. It is further reported that the Japanese Ambassador to Germany, General Oshima, has also requested permission to resign and cede his position to someone more capable, citing his poor health as the reason. However, the Foreign Ministry has urged him to stay, believing that in the current situation, Japan needs a capable observer to monitor the European situation at all times.

The commercial treaty concluded between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the Republic of China will provide closer assistance to future economic and cultural cooperation beneficial to the peoples of both countries. In the current extremely tense international situation, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics' policy of loving peace and providing friendly assistance to invaded nations is inseparable. The Chinese people and their government are well aware that the assistance provided by the Soviet Union in their heroic struggle for national freedom and independence is not mere lip service but a reality. My task is to develop and consolidate the cooperative friendship between the two great countries. I firmly believe that Your Great Excellency, Chairman, and the government of the Republic of China will provide the necessary assistance in the performance of my duties and maintain my representation of the government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. I respectfully ask Your Great Excellency, Chairman, to accept the ardent hope that the Chinese people will achieve complete victory in their struggle for national freedom, and at the same time, I respectfully ask Your Great Excellency, Chairman, to accept the ardent hope that Your Great Excellency, Chairman, will enjoy good health in order to carry out the great and arduous national cause.</p>
<p>Chairman Lin's Reply</p>
<p>Your Excellency, Ambassador, today I am very pleased to accept your credentials as the Plenipotentiary Representative of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to the Republic of China. The Republic of China and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics are the largest contiguous countries in the world, and the friendship between the two peoples is natural and sincere. The recent signing of the commercial treaty has further enhanced the inherent amity between the two countries. Your Excellency's arrival in this country with the mission of developing and consolidating the cooperation between the two countries based on this friendship will undoubtedly deepen the relationship between the two countries and be mutually beneficial. The Republic of China is resisting armed aggression with the full strength of its people in order to maintain its freedom and independence. In this difficult and sacred struggle, we have not only received the boundless sympathy of your country, but also your effective assistance. This sympathy and assistance are sufficient proof of the consistent anti-aggression policy of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The Chinese government and people are therefore increasingly confident that our struggle will achieve a glorious victory. I am extremely grateful for the ardent hope expressed by Your Excellency, Ambassador. The people of the Republic of China will also be deeply moved by this expression. I wish to inform Your Excellency, Ambassador, that the government of the Republic of China will do its utmost to provide Your Excellency with all necessary conveniences and assistance during your term of office, so that Your Excellency may accomplish the important mission entrusted to you.

<h3>Invading Japanese Troops in Guangdong Attempt to Attack Huiyang, Already Contained; Chinese Troops Strike Directly at Dongguan County Seat</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Dispatch: Invading Japanese troops in Guangdong, numbering about ten thousand, are approaching the East River, intending to use all their strength to open up the coastal route in the eastern region, so that the area from Huiyang to Chao-Shan will be completely within the Japanese army's sphere of influence. From a military perspective, this will eliminate the regret of having various port strongholds isolated; politically, it will provide a foothold to control Guangzhou after the Japanese troops withdraw from Guangzhou in the future when the puppet regime in Guangzhou is established. The Japanese army's plan to invade Huiyang is divided into three routes, with the main force taking the route along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway at Pinghu Station, turning into the Hui-Zhang Highway. Although Pinghu has been seized by the Japanese army using all their artillery and cavalry, the Chinese army is holding the Shima exit of the Hui-Zhang Highway, relying on the mountains on both sides to block the Japanese army's advance, and is using fresh troops to assist the regiment in firmly defending the road to ensure the safety between Huiyang and Bo Luo. On the 19th, more than 3,000 Japanese troops once attacked Shima. The guerrilla team of the 4th Column of the Chinese army, together with the 8th Regiment of the Security Corps, met the enemy head-on. On that day, the two sides fought fiercely. Although the Japanese army used aircraft and artillery to cover the advance of their troops, the Chinese army's position had natural defenses and was not destroyed by Japanese aircraft. On the 20th, the Chinese army regiments led by Yuan Hua Zhao, Zhang Yu, and Ye Tieliang launched a counterattack against the Japanese army with high morale, killing many Japanese troops from morning to noon. The Japanese army transferred troops from Shenzhen to provide reinforcements, and the two sides were still in stalemate until the evening of the 20th. As for the Japanese army that slanted out of Longgang, it initially planned to join forces with the Japanese marines landing at Ao Tou to flank the southwest of Huiyang. However, the Japanese troops in Danshui were driven back to their ships by the local regiment. The Japanese troops who rushed out of the Zhenlong Highway from Longgang were intercepted by fresh Chinese troops on the 19th. At the same time, the 3rd Guerrilla Column of Danshui also joined forces with the Chinese army to launch a counterattack. The Japanese army, which had already occupied Longgang, could not hold on and retreated to Henggang in disarray. Therefore, on the 20th, the Chinese army in the Zhangmutou area took the opportunity to launch a counterattack, and the Japanese army on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway line was busy reinforcing. When the Japanese army invaded Huiyang in different directions on the 19th, they sent a team of puppet troops on civilian boats to go up the East River to Bo Luo to contain the Chinese army defending Huiyang and Bo Luo. On the 19th, when they sailed to the vicinity of Ma Sisu Village, they were intercepted by the Chinese army and the militia, and could not advance. On the 20th, because the Japanese troops in Zhangmutou could not penetrate deeply, the puppet troops who came out to disturb the area by waterway did not dare to move forward easily.</p>
<p>In order to break the Japanese army's plot to invade Huiyang, the Chinese army is also using many teams of militia and guerrillas to deal with the situation in different directions and to attack deep into the Japanese army's rear. The 3rd Battalion of the 4th Guerrilla Column, led by Liu Fayu, launched a surprise attack from near Zhongtang on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway on the 18th, striking directly at the Dongguan County seat. At that time, the Japanese and puppet troops in Shilong and Dongguan City had been mostly transferred to Shenzhen Pinghu and to disturb the south bank of the East River, so their strength was weak. The guerrillas of the Liu Battalion advanced sharply along the way and approached Dongguan County seat on the 19th, bombing and destroying the Japanese army's artillery fortresses outside the city. The Japanese and puppet troops did not dare to fight back. Later, the Japanese troops in the Taiping area heard the news and sent 600 troops to provide reinforcements. The Liu Battalion then retreated to the outskirts of Dongguan City, controlling the Japanese army. This battle has had a significant impact on the Japanese army's operations in the Shenzhen area.</p>
<h3>Chinese Troops in Tongshan Break Through Jiawang Coal Mine, Kill 67 Japanese Soldiers, Capture 85 Puppet Police</h3>
<p>Xuzhou Dispatch: The Jiawang Coal Mine Company northeast of Xuzhou was raided and destroyed by Hu Lide, the commander of the 3rd Standing Battalion, sent by Guo Jie Xuan, the magistrate of Tongshan County, in early August. More than 80 puppet police guarding the mine were eliminated, and the Jia-Liu Railway was destroyed, derailing a Japanese military train. After receiving the report, Deputy Commander Zhi Honghan immediately issued an order of commendation. Guo Changxuan's report briefly stated that the puppet police of the Jiawang Coal Mine Company had defected and blown up the mine shaft. This was done by Hu Lide, the commander of the 3rd Battalion of the county, and others, who captured 32 puppet police and 53 who surrendered after two attacks on the old kiln, a total of 85. They are now being moved to and are planned to be incorporated into the standing team for training. The situation in Jiawang Liuquan is chaotic. Because the Jiawang was attacked, the Jia-Liu Railway was also destroyed, causing considerable losses to the Japanese side, which sent cavalry, infantry, and tanks to conduct a strict search, resulting in a chaotic situation there. The telegram also stated that on the morning of July 30, Hu Battalion Commander led and technical team members were responsible for destroying a section of the Jia-Liu Railway, overturning a west-bound coal train. The No. 9 locomotive was also blown up. After a fierce attack by the Chinese side, a total of 67 Japanese soldiers were killed. When the Japanese army used tanks to provide reinforcements, the Chinese army temporarily avoided them. At midnight on the 31st, they destroyed several miles of the Jia-Liu Road, causing great fear to the Japanese side. On the night of August 2, more than 200 Chinese soldiers attacked the Jiawang Kiln, offering a reward of 200 yuan to recruit a 50-member suicide squad to charge forward, killing more than 10 Japanese soldiers and capturing more than 30 puppet police, obtaining 42 rifles, and so on.</p>
<h3>Near Xietang in Suzhou, Chinese Troops Defeat Puppet Police, Puppet Captain Barely Escapes</h3>
<p>Suzhou Dispatch: The entire team of the 2nd General Team of Puppet Jiangsu Provincial Police is composed of beggars and bandits. However, these puppet police are difficult to tame and often carry their inferior firearms to the villages and towns near the city to engage in looting. On the 25th of last month, the commander of the puppet police team, Ma Heng, accompanied by the Japanese instructor, Zhouzhao Mizuta, led a team of 80 soldiers, riding a steamer, to Xietang Town outside Fengmen Gate for inspection. After the inspection, they took the original boat back to Suzhou. However, when they reached Jinji Lake (the second of the Seven Great Lakes of Wu County), they were surrounded by Chinese troops and a fierce battle broke out. In less than half an hour, the Chinese troops had killed more than half of the puppet police. The remaining puppet police accelerated their horsepower and fled towards Suzhou City. The Chinese troops did not pursue them. After Ma and others fled back to Suzhou City, they urgently reported to the puppet provincial government and the Japanese military authorities. After receiving the report, the Japanese army sent a large number of Japanese and puppet troops, but the Chinese troops had already gone elsewhere.</p>
<h3>After the Fall of Dinghai, Thugs Seize the Opportunity for Profit, Captured and Beaten to Death by Villagers</h3>
<p>Dinghai Dispatch: Yang, a clerk of Yancang Township, and a certain team leader, seized the opportunity to loot in the countryside after the fall of Dinghai. They also falsely claimed to collect conscription donations, coercing each Bao to donate 20 yuan, so the general villagers were very angry. A few nights ago, Yang and the team leader were passing by Dun Tou Wang when local residents heard the news and formed a team, carrying sticks and hoes on their backs, captured the two men, beat them to death on the spot, and threw their bodies into the sea. For a time, the people were overjoyed.</p>
<h3>Miao Bin Ambushed, But Not Hit</h3>
<p>Xuzhou Dispatch: Miao Bin, former Director of the Soviet People's Affairs Department, a native of Wuxi, is now the Director of the Guidance Department of the Puppet Xinmin Association in Beiping. The other day, when the Xuzhou Da Min Association Guidance Department was established, Miao took a plane to Xu. When he got off the plane, someone threw a bomb to assassinate him among a group of puppet officials who were welcoming him, causing great chaos for a while. Miao was fortunately not hit, but was greatly frightened. Afterwards, the Xuzhou Japanese military headquarters believed that there were anti-Japanese factions among the welcoming personnel, so they have closely monitored everyone.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Market Experiences Drastic Fluctuations in Foreign Exchange Due to the Impact of the European War; Both British and American Exchange Rates Lengthen; The Legal Tender Becomes More Stable; Prices of Foreign Goods Soar; Transactions Are Chaotic.</p>
<p>After a long period of maneuvering, the German army suddenly launched military operations against Poland in one day. The Shanghai industrial, commercial, and financial sectors were affected by the news of the outbreak of the European War, and the market felt a considerable impact. However, due to the US President's statement, "He can ensure that the United States does not get involved in the European War vortex," the scope of the European War in this port is difficult to predict at this time. However, due to the clear indication of the United States' ability, there should be no sudden and major changes in the Shanghai market. The exchange market is now trending to ease, and gold prices are falling, which is increasingly beneficial to the foundation of China's legal tender. Those in various industries who own European goods are taking a wait-and-see attitude due to the firmness of the people's minds and are not planning to exchange goods. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Black Market Exchange Rates Ease, Legal Tender Prices Stabilize</p>
<p>The Shanghai black market began to ease yesterday. The foreign exchange listing of the British HSBC Bank remained unchanged, but the actual market rate was 4 shillings and a half for British exchange and 7.75 yuan for American exchange. General speculators in the market are flocking to the market, and there is a trend of supply exceeding demand. During the European War in the Republic of China, the British exchange rate reached 9 shillings. Therefore, the public believes that foreign exchange will become increasingly loose, and the United States is making every effort to avoid being involved in the vortex. Therefore, the US exchange rate and the British exchange rate have parted ways. The legal foreign exchange rates announced by the Central Bank every day remain stable as always: (1) 1 shilling and 2 and a half pence for British exchange; (2) 30 US dollars for American exchange.</p>
<p>Gold Securities Plunge in the Gray Market</p>
<p>Due to the outbreak of the European War, people were panicked in the gold and securities gray market, rumors arose, and prices fell sharply. (1) The closing price of gold was 3,575 yuan at noon, and 3,525 yuan in the afternoon, a sharp drop of more than 500 yuan compared to the previous day. The price listed in silver houses has dropped to 350 yuan. (2) The closing price of unified national bonds yesterday afternoon was 557.2 yuan for Type A, down 1.2 yuan; 45.05 yuan for Type B, down 9.5 fen; 43.05 yuan for Type C, down 1.05 yuan; 41.9 yuan for Type D, down 1 yuan; 42.65 yuan for Type E, down 1 yuan.</p>
<p>High Prices of Foreign Goods Have an Impact</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from the import and export sector yesterday: (1) The Shanghai market has already felt the impact of imported foreign goods.顏料·五金·機器。呢絨。疋頭。洋雜貨等, because those who own the goods are all waiting and seeing, and do not intend to sell the goods, while those who own the assets are hoarding for profit, causing the prices of foreign goods to soar, and the market transactions are chaotic. Among them,顏料·五金·洋針等 are particularly serious. It is said that some German orders have been cancelled due to the war. (2) The export of local goods, except for the United States and the Soviet Union, etc., which are still normal and unaffected, the French side has already telegraphed Shanghai to stop the silk business. Therefore, the price of silk has plummeted, and the Shanghai market has no market and the transaction is almost at a standstill. As of now, the export of tung oil, bristles, tea, and minerals to the United Kingdom and the United States has not been affected.</p>
<p>China's Finance Will Become More Beneficial</p>
<p>Regarding China's entire financial system, it is expected to remain stable as always. The easing of the black market foreign exchange rate will increase the value of the legal tender, so it is increasingly beneficial to China's legal tender. As for the drastic changes in the Shanghai financial market, it is entirely caused by speculators and has nothing to do with China's entire financial system. The Chinese government will still supply legal foreign exchange for the import of legitimate goods as much as possible, and the export of local goods will still be able to receive the difference in foreign exchange fees. China's legal tender reserves are still abundant and are the highest in the world. Moreover, 90% of the reserves stored abroad are in the United States, so there will definitely not be any problems.</p>
<p>British Destroyer Leaves Shanghai Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>According to the English-language Great American Evening Post, the British destroyer Duncan left the British naval pontoon in the Huangpu River at 10:30 this morning (the 2nd) and sailed down the river very quickly, which surprised the onlookers on the Bund. Its destination is unknown.</p>
<p>Three German Ships Stop in Kobe</p>
<p>According to the English-language Great American Evening Post, the mystery of the missing German ships Xianghuostu, Aierpi, and Kemolan No. 3 has now been solved. It is said that all three ships are afraid of Kobe. Since there is a threat of war between Germany and Britain and France, the German ships have not kept to their original route in the past few days and have not sailed near the ports of Britain. The news that three or more German ships are now avoiding in Japan is quite surprising.</p>
<p>According to reports, the Xianghuostu left Shanghai on August 21. After arriving in Manila, it sailed to Singapore, but suddenly returned to Manila. It is said that 20 passengers would rather not reach their destination and disembark in Manila. It is now reported that the Xianghuostu has arrived in Kobe yesterday (the 1st), and most of the other passengers are still on board. Mr. Ke Tou, the Norwegian Minister to China and Japan, took the ship from Shanghai to start and was a passenger. It is said that the Kemolan had not arrived in Manila by the due date a few days ago. The ship apparently did not sail to that place and sailed directly to Kobe. Italian ships are also avoiding sailing to British ports. The Italian ship Kangtiebikano, which had 150 passengers bound for India, did not dock in Mumbai and is expected to sail directly to Masoya. In addition, the Italian ship Ruliangaisha was scheduled to load passengers in Shanghai for Europe. After docking at the Gonghexiang Wharf for several days, it moved to the Texaco oil depot in Pudong on the Huangpu River yesterday afternoon to refuel. The ship will leave Shanghai soon. It is impossible to know for sure this morning, but the public believes that a team of ten Italian naval and marine corps soldiers has boarded the ship.</p>
<p>French Mail Ship Changxing Sails as Usual</p>
<p>Due to the tense situation in Europe, the various foreign merchant ships in the port have been prepared for a long time, but there was no action yesterday. The French mail ship Qinlabao, which was originally scheduled to stay in Saigon, is expected to enter the port at 8:00 AM today and dock at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou. Passengers will transfer to small boats and land at the Customs Wharf at 10:00 AM. The ship will also transport 11,000 bags of foreign rice from Saigon. After the cargo is unloaded, it will still sail to Japan according to the original schedule at 8:00 AM tomorrow morning (the 4th) and return to Shanghai on the 11th of this month. The Queen of Japan, a Changxing company, went to Hong Kong and Little Luzon in the middle of last month and is now on its way back. It is scheduled to arrive today (the 3rd) at 3:00 PM and dock at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou. Passengers will take small boats and land at the Customs Wharf at 4:30 PM. The large ship is scheduled to leave the anchor at 8:30 AM tomorrow morning (the 4th) and return to Canada via Japan and Honolulu. The boat for passengers will depart from the Customs Wharf at 11:00 PM tonight. The company's Queen of Asia left Vancouver on the 19th of last month and came to Shanghai via Japan. It is scheduled to enter the port at 3:30 PM tomorrow (the 4th) and dock at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou. Passengers will take a small fireboat and land at the Customs Wharf at 5:00 PM. The large ship will leave the port early at 11:00 PM on the same day (the 4th) and go to Hong Kong and Little Luzon. The boat for passengers will depart from the Customs Wharf at 9:30 PM on the 4th.</p>
<p>Efforts to Dredge the Export of Local Goods</p>
<p>The Chinese government is deeply concerned that the outbreak of the European War will affect the export of Chinese local goods. Therefore, the Trade Commission is making every effort to ensure that the export of major local goods is not affected by the European War. In the past, the export of local goods was concentrated in Hong Kong. Now, new export routes have been opened up. Attention has been paid to countries such as the United States and the Soviet Union, because the government has signed contracts with the United States and the Soviet Union to exchange goods. However, so far, except for the silk business in France, which has been affected, the export of other local goods has not been significantly affected.</p>
<p>Japanese Residents Take Action</p>
<p>According to the Zilin Daily, at a reception for journalists held by the Japanese side yesterday, someone asked what action the Japanese authorities had ordered Japanese civilians in any part of the Far East to take in the event of the outbreak of the European War. A spokesman for the Japanese ambassador replied, "Not yet." He did not know whether any orders would be issued.</p>
<p>Hitler's Moves after the German Invasion of Shanghai: German Merchants Rush to Withdraw Goods from Warehouses; Lilihua and Far East Ships Await Orders in Zhenhai</p>
<p>As Germany and Poland have begun military action, German merchants in this port have become uneasy. Defu Foreign Company specifically notified the Shanghai Xiyanliao Industry Association yesterday, asking them to inform their counterparts to clear out the warehouse receipts that have been issued to avoid accidents and not to be responsible. The original letter is translated as follows: "Please clear out the warehouse receipts issued by our company immediately. We are not responsible for any accidents." After receiving the letter, the association has notified its members and customers to be aware.</p>
<p>German Ships Await Orders in Zhenhai</p>
<p>As the conflict between Germany and Poland has surfaced, the Shipping Department of Lilihua Foreign Company and the Far East Company in this city has not received any instructions from the German leadership regarding the actions of the Moufu, Haifu, and Hanna ships as of yesterday. All three ships are anchored outside the mouth of Zhenhai, waiting to unload their cargo. The unloading must be carried out in order, and it is not easy to return to Shanghai for a while. Future changes are currently unpredictable.</p>
<p>Shipping is Unobstructed</p>
<p>The German Pinglun and Enderlund of the Italian Zhongyi Company and the Shililun of the Yihua Foreign Company and the Yingzhou Lun of Taikoo Company still normally operate the Shanghai Ningbo line, so passenger and freight transportation can be unobstructed. At present, because the Ningbo authorities are evacuating the population, the export of women and children has not been prohibited. At the same time, because the cost of living in Shanghai is so high, it is not easy to stay, so passengers coming to Shanghai from Ningbo and going to Ningbo from Shanghai are quite busy.</p>
<p>Polish Ambassador Wei Duntao Returns Home Today</p>
<p>Wei Duntao, the Polish ambassador to China, has been in Shanghai for 20 years since taking office in 1919. After Mr. Wei took office in China, he signed the Sino-Polish Friendship Treaty with the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, making every effort to promote Sino-Polish relations. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the National Government moved west. Although Mr. Wei was old and sick, and Wang, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the National Government, repeatedly sent telegrams urging him to go west, he never got his wish. Recently, the situation in Europe has become tense, and the Polish government has concentrated diplomatic talents. Therefore, it specifically summoned Mr. Wei to return home. The position of ambassador to China has been filled by Mr. Baster, who was newly appointed by the Polish government as chargé d'affaires. Before Mr. Ba arrives, it will be temporarily taken over by Consul General Bao Huomoreisi. Mr. Wei has decided to take the Queen of Japan of Changxing Company from Shanghai at 6:00 AM today. Sino-Western friends in the sea and staff of the embassy have arrived at the port this morning to welcome him.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance Encourages Savings Deposits, and the Income Tax Handling Fee Continues to be Refunded</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance sent a true telegram to the Shanghai Banking and Money Industry Association, saying: "I have read the Shanghai Banking and Money Industry Association's case regarding the special approval of a 10% handling fee refund to depositors for income tax on deposit interest. The original deadline was June 30 of this year. However, during this extraordinary period, in order to encourage savings and strengthen finance, and out of consideration for hardship, this case will be allowed to continue to be implemented before the end of the war. In addition to reporting to the Executive Yuan and submitting it to the National Government for filing and issuing orders, you are required to inform your counterparts to comply and deduct the tax in a practical manner."</p>
<p>Finance Minister Kong Speaks Out About the Collection of Counterfeit Currency by Customs: Violation of Government Laws is Absolutely Intolerable; Counterfeit Currency Cannot be Exchanged for Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>(ReChongqing on the 2nd) Regarding the counterfeit order issued by the counterfeit supervisor of the Jianghai Customs, ordering the customs to collect and use the counterfeit banknotes of the "Huaxing Bank" from September 1, which undermines the customs gold system, the Central News Agency reporter went to visit President Kong of the Executive Yuan to inquire about the content. The answer was roughly as follows: "The personnel of the Shanghai Customs all belong to the Chinese government. If they betray their trust and accept counterfeit orders from institutions other than legitimate organs of the National Government, I cannot believe it. If the customs implements this counterfeit order or other counterfeit orders, not only will the customs rights enjoyed by friendly governments and people be greatly infringed, but the development of the entire Shanghai commerce will also be affected. This is very obvious." President Kong also said, "Regarding this matter, the government has telegraphed the General Tax Office to instruct the customs commissioners of each customs to pay all customs import duties in legal currency according to the exchange rate quoted by the Central Bank. Any measures that violate the law are absolutely not tolerated by the government."</p>
<p>After the Jianghai Customs was Forced to Accept "Huaxing Coupons," the Tax Collection Office of the Bank of China Was Forcibly Occupied; Tax Collectors Withdrew and Were Temporarily Transferred to the Shanghai Branch, Awaiting Instructions from the Head Office; Trade Between Various Countries and China Has Been Repelled; The Exchange Rate Announced by the "Supervisory Office" is a Tax Increase in Disguise; The Details Are as Follows:</p>
<p>Tax Collectors Temporarily Transferred to the Shanghai Branch</p>
<p>After the tax collection office of the Central Bank Jianghai Customs was forcibly occupied by Japanese personnel sent by the Yokohama Zhengjin Bank, the tax collectors of the Bank of China were forced to withdraw. After the director of the tax collection office, Mr. Shen, asked the director of the Shanghai branch, all the personnel of the tax collection office were temporarily transferred to work in the Shanghai branch, and the situation of being forced to withdraw was reported to the Chongqing head office. Now they are waiting for instructions from the head office. However, the bank has always refused to accept "Huaxing Coupons," and the legal tender price of customs gold is still announced as usual. On the 2nd, one yuan of customs gold was converted into 2.58 yuan of legal tender, which is calculated based on London pure gold.</p>
<p>After the Forcible Occupation, the Exchange Rate is Announced</p>
<p>After the Yokohama Zhengjin Bank forcibly occupied the tax collection office of the Central Bank Jianghai Customs, the "Jianghai Customs Supervisory Office" announced the exchange rate of customs gold converted into "Huaxing Coupons" from the 1st. The exchange rate announced on the 2nd was 2.564 yuan of "Huaxing Coupons" for one yuan of customs gold, and 1.55 yuan of legal tender for one yuan of "Huaxing Coupons." If taxes are paid in legal tender, it is 3.975 yuan of legal tender for one yuan of customs gold. However, the customs gold mentioned by the "Supervisory Office" is only nominally in name and is not calculated based on the London pure gold market. The foreign exchange price of "Huaxing Coupons" is assumed to be 6 pence in British currency.</p>
<p>Foreign Commerce Will Inevitably Suffer</p>
<p>According to the Continental Daily, the Yokohama Zhengjin Bank sent 33 Japanese employees to the tax collection office of the Central Bank Jianghai Customs yesterday (the 1st) to implement the new regulations on collecting customs duties and all taxes in Huaxing currency, and announced that Huaxing currency is converted into 1.55 yuan of national currency. A reporter recently asked an important businessman about this matter. According to him, "Foreign commerce in Shanghai will inevitably suffer. Since no one can predict what the conversion rate will be tomorrow, merchants cannot determine how much their foreign goods will cost when they actually arrive."</p>
<p>The Final Result is to Squeeze Shanghai Out</p>
<p>Before the implementation of this regulation, foreign merchants here could estimate the value of their imported goods in legal tender with the help of the customs gold unit system. Under the current arrangement, the legal tender is arbitrarily determined by the puppet bank and the Japanese side every day. There will inevitably be unrest among foreign merchants in this port. However, this is still the smallest of the disasters of the new customs regulations. The final result is that foreign commerce is squeezed out of Shanghai.</p>
<p>It is Difficult to Obtain Foreign Exchange by Forcibly Using Counterfeit Currency</p>
<p>Since the devaluation of the legal tender, foreign commerce in Shanghai and other places has suffered losses. However, merchants can still obtain unlimited foreign exchange in the market, and some can even obtain foreign exchange at the exchange rate of the Chinese government. If Huaxing currency is once in general circulation, merchants will not be able to obtain foreign exchange without the written permission of the Japanese government. Huaxing currency has hardly reached the status of being called "currency."</p>
<p>A Proposal Once Advocated Was Rejected</p>
<p>The counterfeit bank has only issued 2 million yuan worth of banknotes so far, which is far from enough for Shanghai to circulate. Those who are not in general circulation are not called "currency." The current amount of legal tender in circulation in Shanghai is 60 million yuan. Now, because the customs revenue has been drastically reduced, the Japanese side has taken this action. In July, the Japanese authorities once proposed to implement new regulations, but it was immediately rejected by the Tokyo financial community, because they were still afraid that foreign commerce would be severely hit by this plan and take retaliatory measures.</p>
<p>Customs Revenue Will Not Improve</p>
<p>In the first half of this year, the revenue of the Jianghai Customs was 72 million yuan, which was deposited in the Yokohama Zhengjin Bank. At that time, the average value of the legal tender was 6 pence, and the Japanese side obtained about 2.5 million pounds in British currency. Now that the legal tender has devalued and foreign trade has also declined, the customs revenue in the second half of the year will naturally decrease. Observers believe that the total customs revenue in the second half of the year will not exceed 48 million yuan. According to the current exchange rate, the Japanese side will receive 750,000 pounds in British currency. However, by collecting customs duties and other taxes in Huaxing currency, the Japanese side will increase its income from customs by at least 55% in the next few months this year.</p>
<p>Counterfeit Currency Cannot be Exchanged for Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>As for the Japanese claim that Huaxing currency is pegged to 6 pence in British currency and can be used to purchase foreign exchange, it is all a deception of the public. The Japanese side sets the exchange rate and uses Huaxing currency to exchange for legal tender. In addition, there are only 2 million yuan of Huaxing currency in circulation. Even if all of it is obtained, the amount of foreign exchange that can be purchased is limited.</p>
<p>German Consul General Returns to Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<p>German Consul General Fei Shier returned to Shanghai yesterday.</p>
<p>The Propaganda Department of the Central Committee Sent Zhu Xinggong a Funeral Gift of 1,000 Yuan and Requested the Central Committee to Issue an Order of Commendation</p>
<p>(Chongqing, 1st) Zhu Songlu, pen name Xinggong, editor of the supplement "Night Light" of the Shanghai Great American Evening Post, was assassinated by thugs in Shanghai on August 30. The Propaganda Department of the Central Committee believes that Mr. Zhu has been the editor of the Great American Supplement for many years and has made every effort to promote the war of resistance. His assassination is deeply regretted. In addition to sending a telegram of condolences to Mr. Zhu's family and remitting a funeral gift of 1,000 yuan, it will also request the Central Committee to issue an order of commendation to comfort his heroic spirit.</p>
<p>Four Chinese in the Tianjin Peace Case Believe They Have Not Yet Been Handed Over; All Matters Related to this Case Will Be Decided at the Hearing; The British Military Commander Must Send a Representative to Shanghai</p>
<p>According to the English-language Great American Evening Post, the Shanghai Ellis Law Office, which is acting for four Chinese terrorist suspects detained by the British authorities in Tianjin, believes this morning (the 2nd) that the four suspects have not yet been handed over to the Japanese authorities in North China. According to a lawyer at the law office, he has telegraphed Tianjin, but a telegram is required from the Tianjin representative reporting that the four men have been handed over. Judge Jones has issued a summons to the British authorities in Tianjin who detained the four men. All matters related to this case will be decided at the hearing on the summons on September 11. At that time, it will be ruled whether the writ of habeas corpus applies to non-British people detained by the British side.</p>
<p>The British Consulate Has Also Telegraphed Tianjin to Inquire</p>
<p>In addition, according to news, the British Embassy in this port telegraphed the British Consulate in Tianjin urgently on the 31st of last month to inquire about the truth about the transfer of four Chinese suspects in the Tianjin assassination case. As of the 1st, there was still no reply. The British Embassy is quite concerned about this and telegraphed the British Consulate in Dajin again at 3:30 PM on the 1st to make a second determination and request a prompt reply on the action in this case.</p>
<p>Sir Mossa is Scheduled to Hear the Case</p>
<p>However, the public believes that the British Concession authorities in Tianjin have not yet implemented the extradition in accordance with the British government's order for the four prisoners they are detaining. As for their fate, it is unknown. According to Judge Jones, who is handling the case, the Tianjin British Concession authorities have not accepted the case for handling. Therefore, the British military commander in Tianjin, Luo Lei, must be summoned to court to testify. If Commander Luo cannot attend the court, he must send a legal representative to come here. The summons will be debated here on the 11th of this month. The hearer will be Judge Mossa, who has just returned to Shanghai from Japan to avoid the summer heat.</p>
<p>Yesterday at around 8:00 PM, a Japanese No. 14 iron barge, fully loaded with heavy quantities of transported goods, cursed and sailed to the vicinity of Yangshupu. Due to the excessive load, it could not support it and suddenly sank into the Huangpu River. The Japanese side is still salvaging it.</p>

<p>Japanese Navy Vows to Blockade Meizhou Port in Southern Fujian</p>
<p>Notification to All Countries' Ships to Leave by the 6th</p>
<p>(Shanghai News on the 2nd) The Japanese Navy authorities have decided to blockade the waters around Meizhou Port in the southernmost part of Fujian Province. The Japanese Consul General in Shanghai notified the diplomatic representatives and customs authorities of various countries on the morning of the 3rd that the Japanese Navy will blockade Meizhou Port in Fujian Province on the morning of September 6. The area is near the line close to Xiaozhaishan and Luoges (transliteration) near Meizhou Port and near the line connecting Laowan (transliteration) and Xiaote (transliteration). All countries' ships are hoped to leave this area before the 6th.</p>
<p>The National Government Massively Reserves Military Grain and Food for Wartime</p>
<p>Restricting the Brewing of Major Food Grains for Accumulation; Shanghai Merchants Massively Purchase Rice from the Interior, Raising Prices</p>
<p>The National Government is extremely concerned about the military and civilian food supply during wartime. Since the promulgation of the Food Adjustment Measures during the Emergency Period, all provinces, cities, and counties have successively established food transportation and sales agencies to preside over food chain sales and adjustment matters. Food associations have been universally established in areas close to the war zone and in important areas in the interior. The production of rice, wheat, and miscellaneous grains in various provinces in the interior, such as Sichuan, Yunnan, Hunan, and Guangxi, has greatly increased after the government encouraged food production. It is now known that this year's food supply can be said to be a bumper harvest due to favorable weather conditions and improved planting methods. In order to prevent the improper consumption of food, the government has again ordered the local authorities of various provinces to restrict the brewing of major food grains for large-scale Jiao Lei preparation to meet the needs of the long-term war of resistance. The hoarding and manipulation by dishonest people and the smuggling and external transportation are strictly prohibited to stabilize market prices.</p>
<p>Reasons for the High Prices in Northern Jiangsu</p>
<p>Taizhou, Taixing, and Rugao and other places in northern Jiangsu have had a bumper harvest of early rice this year, and the price is also surprisingly cheap. Therefore, rice merchants from all over the country have flocked to these places to purchase in large quantities, causing the local selling price to rise by several yuan from 13 yuan. In addition, the cost of shipping to Shanghai, including taxes and transportation costs along the way, has also risen by several yuan from 18 yuan. Therefore, customers who have already handled the business have also sold it at a good price locally, resulting in stagnation of goods transported to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Rice Shops in Shanghai Gradually Strengthen Their Appetite</p>
<p>Yesterday, there was not much rice arriving in Shanghai. The holders of goods believed that the time was ripe and sold more than 10,000 bags in the market. At the same time, the appetite of the rice shops was very strong. Although retail sales were scarce, the inventory was very thin, so they all bought the rice. In total, more than 9,000 bags were traded. The price of each stall in the morning market rose by one yuan, and the price of the late market rose by 5 to 7 jiao.</p>
<p>Rice Boats Detained in Pudong Are Released</p>
<p>On the day before yesterday, 15 rice boats transporting rice to Shanghai from Southern Huangpu, totaling 3,750 bags, were detained by the Japanese army on Dongchang Road. On the 31st, two more boats were detained, totaling about 4,000 bags. The Japanese text plans to force the sale of the rice in the occupied area. After many negotiations by rice merchants, all of them were released until today, but their losses have been considerable.</p>
<p>The Interest Rates of Pawnshops are Not Uniform</p>
<p>In the past, the interest rate of pawnshops in this city was mostly 1.8%, and the maturity period was 18 months. Before the war, due to the low price of goods, there was a considerable loss after the pawned goods matured and were not redeemed due to changes in style. Therefore, a movement was launched to shorten the pawn period to one year, but it failed due to the recovery of commodity prices and the different opinions of the industry. After the war, commodity prices soared. Except for pawnshops in the war zone, pawnshops in the concession mostly made profits, because only gold and silver jewelry in the pawned goods were considerable. Other clothing, copper, tin, and other full goods were also quite profitable. Therefore, it is unreasonable for pawnshops to increase interest rates at this time. However, the industry finally implemented a unified interest rate of 2% from September 1. However, the situation of pawnshops in the concession is very complicated. Not only do the new and old members of the industry have their own doors, with differences in status, but there are also potential pawnshops. Therefore, in practice, the interest charged by pawnshops in the concession from September 1 is still not uniform. For example, the interest charged for pawn loans can even reach 30 to 40%. The maturity of the pawned goods is even more chaotic. Some are 18 months, some are 12 months, and some are even 6 months or even several months. This is indeed an obstacle to the livelihood of the poor.</p>
<p>Commodity Prices Soar and Food Rations Double; Disaster Relief is Needed Urgently</p>
<p>The Industry Group of the Refugee Relief Association notified the industry associations yesterday that the cost of food rations for refugees in this city has increased several times due to soaring commodity prices. The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association feels the seriousness of the situation and visited the Dutch authorities. After convening a meeting, it was resolved that all disaster relief activities held by all sectors of society should be increased or continued. It is the duty of our people to bear the burden of relieving refugees and is also the most serious problem in society. In this difficult situation, our business colleagues should take the lead in supporting this charity. In addition to distributing letters, all disaster relief activities held by your association that have not set a deadline at the beginning of the event are urgently hoped to continue to be collected. Those who have set a deadline are requested to consider the suffering of the refugees and the hidden worries of society and must continue to hold the event without interruption.</p>
<p>The Citizens Group of the Double Refugee Relief Association released the fundraising statistics as of the end of August as follows:</p>
<p>Donation Statistics: Donations received totaled 254,997.277 yuan, 15,724 yuan collected by the association on behalf, and 50,000 yuan receivable and uncollected, totaling 320,721.277 yuan in fundraising donations.</p>
<p>Sponsorship Statistics: 12,490 households participated in the sponsorship, totaling 16,369 people.</p>
<p>The North China Flood May Give Priority to Emergency Relief</p>
<p>The China Foreign Relief Society is in charge of actively carrying out relief for the North China flood. The first batch of protective medicines will be boxed up in the near future and sent directly to Tianjin. After contacting Honorary President Sun Zhongying, who reported by telegram from Tianjin, it has been decided to hold a board of directors meeting on the 5th of this month (Tuesday) to determine a specific relief plan and engage in work. Or the association will allocate some funds to handle emergency relief first, and then solicit donations from all sectors of society, both Chinese and foreign. It is deeply hoped that all sectors will donate soil, bandits, or medicines and enthusiastically support the effort. It is also heard that the Tianjin Zhongyuan Company and the Zhongyuan Bank have automatically organized the Zhongyuan Company Disaster Relief Association to prepare steamed buns, medicines, and drinks, and load them on two large ships every day to distribute them to the disaster areas. In the past two days, they have assisted more than 5,000 disaster victims.</p>
<p>Chinese Police in the Public Concession Hope for Subsidies</p>
<p>With the Follow-up Call, Yu Qiaqing Requested to Make a Proposal on His Behalf</p>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, Mr. Yu Qiaqing, a Chinese director of the Public Concession Board, is enthusiastic about public undertakings in the concession. For example, his efforts to purchase foreign rice to maintain the people's food supply have been supported by all sectors of society. The Chinese police under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Public Concession Patrol Room number in the thousands. Their wages are mostly between 30 and 40 yuan, and some are only more than 20 yuan. During this period of soaring cost of living, rice costs more than 30 yuan per stone, and other necessities such as water, electricity, rent, firewood, and coal are all high. It is very difficult to maintain a family of several people with this. It is recently heard that the Chinese police in various patrol rooms have submitted letters to Mr. Yu, asking him to advocate for justice and ask the authorities to provide appropriate subsidies to maintain their livelihood. Mr. Yu expressed his deep sympathy and is said to be preparing to propose to the Board to increase the subsidies for Chinese police.</p>
<p>Cholera is Prevalent</p>
<p>Seventeen Patients in Four Days</p>
<p>The weather in this port is extremely cool in the heat of summer. After entering autumn, it suddenly becomes hot. Except for the temperature that dropped briefly after the hurricane passed a few days ago, the average temperature is above 90 degrees. Therefore, the health effects caused by this abnormal climate are very large. True cholera has spread from sporadic to epidemic. According to the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital, in addition to the 16 cases that had been reported to the Industry Bureau for chemical laboratory testing and confirmed to be true cholera, 17 new cases have been discovered in</p>

<p>Weekly Supplement Modern Figures Hitler's Secret Wei Sheng</p>
<h3>Key to Victory</h3>
<p>Since Hitler seized power in Germany, he has recovered the Saar, annexed Austria, and destroyed Czechoslovakia, his arrogance soaring and unmatched! Recently, he has again used the issue of Danzig and the Polish Corridor as an excuse to deploy troops and openly provoke, making it impossible to maintain peace in Europe. The power of life and death of millions of people is actually in his hands!</p>
<p>What extraordinary abilities or secret to victory does Hitler possess? According to the views of a certain French writer, Hitler's secret, when revealed, is very ordinary. In a nutshell, he knows that to defeat an enemy, one must overcome their resistance. And this so-called resistance contains two inseparable elements: first, their ability to fight; second, their determination to exert this ability.</p>
<p>Winning Hearts is Paramount</p>
<p>If the enemy's fighting power is extremely weak but their spirit of resistance is very high, Hitler will first try every means to use his tricks of sowing discord and his methods of coercion and inducement to weaken the enemy's spirit of resistance; then, he can conquer them without firing a shot. As for those hypothetical enemies with extraordinarily strong fighting power, Hitler dare not easily deal with them. He must redouble his efforts to ease their rebellious emotions and shake their determination to fight. The great principle in Chinese military strategy, "The best way to use troops is to attack the mind, next is to attack cities," Hitler not only understands but also is quite capable of applying in practice.</p>
<p>Take his destruction of Czechoslovakia as an example. Before the Munich Agreement was signed, Czechoslovakia believed it could rely on foreign aid and sit back and relax. Even if Hitler carried out aggression as a villain, Czechoslovakia would only suffer deeply within a few months of the start of the war, and ultimate victory would certainly be assured. Unexpectedly, in September of last year, Britain and France changed their minds, while Germany, Hungary, Poland, and other countries exerted pressure at the same time, which completely despaired Czechoslovakia and forced it to painfully conclude the "Treaty of Surrender!" Originally, those who destroy a country generally first defeat its military force, making it impossible to continue military resistance, then occupy its land, making it impossible to reorganize the remnants of its army and attempt a comeback, and finally eliminate its spirit of resistance, making it impossible to rise again. Only then is the victory of the war a lasting victory. However, Hitler's procedure for destroying Czechoslovakia was exactly the opposite: he first fundamentally destroyed Czechoslovakia's determination to fight, then forcibly occupied its territory, and finally resolved its army.</p>
<p>The Role of Propaganda</p>
<p>In his book "Mein Kampf," Hitler repeatedly mentioned the last World War, but his vigorous pen did not describe the tragic scenes of "millions of corpses lying and blood flowing for thousands of miles" on the battlefield, nor did he praise those brave warriors who "wore strong armor and charged into battle." In "Mein Kampf," two chapters recount the events of the last war, one titled "Wartime Propaganda" and the other "German Revolution." According to his judgment, the Allied countries' propaganda techniques at the time were far superior to those of Germany, and the disloyal minorities within Germany and the radical figures who were easily incited were the best targets for Allied propagandists and spies. Therefore, Hitler hoped to build a purely Germanic nation and hated Jews, socialists, and Catholics. In order to prevent foreign propaganda "poison" from flowing into the country, he tried his best to deceive the eyes and ears of his people. Therefore, Germans now know less and are more confused about the world situation than they were in 1918.</p>
<p>Three Methods</p>
<p>Hitler learned profound lessons from Germany's past experiences. He wanted to deal with Britain and France by "using their own methods against them." First, the external propaganda he launched was very thorough. In his speeches, there was not one that did not repeatedly state that Germany had a moral reason to restore its lost rights. Whether it was the Saar, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Danzig, or Poland, Germany's demands were based on undeniable rights. Why should a whole piece of German land be divided by the Polish Corridor? Is this fair? Is this reasonable? Are Britain and France willing to sacrifice millions of lives to maintain this unfair and unreasonable situation? Are they willing to oppose Germany? If Britain and France are willing to respect Germany's rights and resolve the issue of Danzig and the Corridor, Germany will never have any further demands. The foundation for permanent peace in Europe can be laid from now on. Why should Britain and France stubbornly resist to the end, losing big because of small things?</p>
<p>First, on the eve of creating any "miracle," Hitler will first mobilize a large army and flaunt his military power, while his public and private propaganda organs must do their best to exaggerate the strength of Germany's military preparations in order to subdue his enemies.</p>
<p>Third, Hitler is always thinking about inciting internal strife in his hypothetical enemy countries. Knowing that the domestic affairs of Britain and France are well-governed and flawless, making it difficult to succeed, he is still doing his best to encourage the autonomy movement in Alsace and the independence of Ireland. In addition, Nazi spies have penetrated into the interior of various countries, separately lobbying opposition leaders, hoping to cause political turmoil and disrupt public opinion.</p>
<p>Recently, Germany and Poland have started firing, why didn't Hitler want to have another Munich Agreement beforehand? As long as the likes of Chamberlain and Daladier repeat last year's mistakes, and soften their attitude, Danzig and Poland will follow in the footsteps of the Sudetenland and Czechoslovakia, and Hitler will get his wish.</p>
<p>The Key to War and Peace</p>
<p>The intrinsic value of Danzig and the Corridor is not that important. What is frightening is that at that time, Britain and France's current allies, such as Greece, Romania, and Turkey, will have no choice but to be disappointed with Britain and France and throw themselves into Hitler's arms. Finally, Britain and France will inevitably quarrel with each other and split, become isolated because of the split, and be easily defeated one by one because of the isolation. Hitler's dream of building a "Third Great German Empire" can then be realized.</p>
<p>The so-called secret to Hitler's victory is nothing more than this. A Corner of the Battlefield An Important Area in Southern Jiangsu Zhangzhu Yong</p>
<p>Starting from the continuous Tianmu Mountains, after crossing the high Tongguan Mountain, the terrain gradually becomes flat, forming a large basin. Standing on the hillside and looking down, there is a vast river that meanders from the depths of the mountains, crosses the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway, emerges from the mountains, and leads north all the way to Yixing and Liyang, and even to the county towns of various counties in the south of the Yangtze River. On both banks of the river, countless houses are piled up on top of each other, right in the center of three mountains, this is the town of Zhangzhu where I stayed for two months.</p>
<p>A Hub of Land and Water Transportation</p>
<p>Holding the hub of land and water transportation, Zhangzhu was one of the largest towns in the border area of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui before the war. The population was dense and commerce was prosperous, comparable to a third-class county town. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, Shanghai fell, and various places south of the Yangtze River fell one after another. This only remaining piece of clean land became a gathering place for refugees. The market became more lively, restaurants and hotels flourished, the department store industry was overwhelmed, and the streets were crowded with people, presenting a deformed development. Although the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway and the branch road to Guangde, which run through the town, were damaged due to the war, all import and export goods can still be transported using waterways and the original roads, so Zhangzhu still remains a distribution center for goods.</p>
<p>The Situation is Extremely Dangerous</p>
<p>Because of its backing on mountains and facing a lake (across the lake), the situation is extremely dangerous, and it is the only route from Jiangsu to southern Anhui and western Zhejiang, it occupies an extremely important position militarily. On the one hand, it holds the key to the gateway of Anhui and Zhejiang, and on the other hand, it can control Wuxi and Changzhou, threatening the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway at any time. Therefore, after capturing Yixing, the Japanese army took advantage of the momentum and went down to Zhangzhu. However, Zhangzhu's terrain was too unfavorable for them. The undulating mountains and dense bamboo gardens everywhere not only made tanks ineffective, but even airplanes could not see any targets and could not exert their power. The Japanese army was clueless when it got inside, and only stayed for nineteen days before losing their footing and retreating all the way to the north of Gehu Lake, where they finally gained a foothold. Now, from Zhangzhu to the north to the southern bank of Gehu Lake, east to Taihu Lake and west to Gaochun, this arc-shaped front line is always under the control of the Chinese army.</p>
<p>Interesting Stories About the Battle for Tongguan Mountain</p>
<p>Regarding the battle for the Tongguan Mountain position at that time, there was such an interesting story: "Because all the Chinese army's fortifications were destroyed by Japanese artillery fire, they were forced to withdraw from the position. After the Japanese army occupied the Chinese army's position, they had not had time to change the flag when three heavy bombers painted with the Rising Sun emblem flew in with a roar. The pilot saw the flag of the Blue Sky with a White Sun fluttering on the hilltop, and regardless of the consequences, dropped a dozen bombs in a row. Amid the collapse of mountains and the scattering of flesh and blood, hundreds of Japanese soldiers were sacrificed. In such a chaotic state, the Chinese army took the opportunity to launch a fierce counterattack. When the Japanese headquarters received accurate information, they sent two giant transport planes loaded with a large amount of food, flying to the sky above Tongguan Mountain. Bread, biscuits, cakes, and beef fell like raindrops, while those hiding in the trenches were precisely the brave Chinese soldiers!"</p>
<p>People's Lives are Stable</p>
<p>Although Zhangzhu is located on the front line, the sound of artillery fire can often be heard. Sometimes when both sides are in fierce battle, the sound of machine guns can be heard clearly. However, merchants operate as usual and farmers farm as usual, without any panic. This is because they know that the Japanese have no power to attack, so they maintain calmness in the midst of tension.</p>
<p>Education here does not stop because of the war. In the morning and evening, one can see many students carrying schoolbags, happily going to school and going home. The able-bodied men are also stepping up training. Every dawn, the slogans of "One, two, three—four, one" on the training ground resonate through the sky. Songs for saving the country have penetrated the people's hearts, and even the cowherds riding on the backs of cows can hum the kind of impassioned and heroic songs: "Go forward, don't retreat, life and death have reached the final stage..."</p>
<p>The Baojia system is organized extremely strictly, with ammunition transported to the front and wounded soldiers sent to the rear. Everything is handled in an orderly manner. In early April, all sectors jointly implemented the National Spiritual Mobilization Propaganda Week, and at the same time held a national oath-taking ceremony. Party members took oaths, and a grand torch parade was held in the evening, with more than thousands of soldiers and civilians participating. The atmosphere was tragic and enthusiastic, which is worth remembering.</p>
<p>The current Zhangzhu has become the center of the south of the Yangtze River, and it is also the base for the Chinese army to recover the lost territories in the southeast in the future! Worth noting Lang Piaoran writes Economic Common Sense Foreign Exchange Control Feng Kechang</p>
<p>Foreign exchange control refers to the intervention of a government in foreign exchange in order to adjust its international balance of payments, or the appropriate management of a country's public and private receipts and expenditures to foreign countries. Under strict foreign exchange control, all foreign currency receipts and payments by public and private institutions and individuals must be handled centrally through specific government agencies. The control method is nothing more than collecting all foreign currency income nationwide at a statutory price or by compulsory means, and stipulating that when public and private institutions or individuals need to pay foreign currency, they must be reviewed by specific agencies. Those approved will be supplied at the legal price, otherwise, they will not be supplied.</p>
<p>Foreign Currency Receipts and Payments</p>
<p>The sources of a country's foreign currency income are no more than six types: (1) the price receivable for export trade; (2) foreign currency or foreign currency securities originally held; (3) business income from overseas Chinese and shipping, and other investment income; (4) recovery of existing foreign currency deposits and other claims; (5) consumption by foreigners in the country; (6) transportation of cash, silver, etc. Under strict foreign exchange control, all of these are in the list of items to be centrally managed. As for the foreign currency that a country needs to pay, the legitimate needs are five items: (1) the price payable for import trade; (2) repayment of other existing foreign currency debts; (3) expenses for foreign officials and students and people traveling overseas; (4) remittances of foreign residents for household use; (5) foreign merchants' insurance premiums and freight, etc. Other than these, most of them belong to the category of capital flight, the so-called illegitimate needs. Furthermore, among the above-mentioned legitimate needs, there are still priorities and degrees of importance. All illegitimate needs and non-urgent foreign currency payments must be restricted under strict foreign exchange control. However, since the scope of centralizing foreign currency income and restricting foreign currency payments is so broad, it is naturally inevitable that there will be loopholes, resulting in the establishment of a foreign exchange "black market."</p>
<p>Purchase Restrictions</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the new currency policy in China, there has been a policy of unrestricted buying and selling of foreign exchange, which has not changed even at the beginning of the "August 13th" war. It was not until mid-March of last year, when the pseudo "United Reserve Bank" was established in North China and issued unprepared and non-convertible banknotes in an attempt to exchange legal currency and obtain foreign exchange, that the Chinese government believed that if restrictions were not imposed, the foreign exchange fund of the legal currency would be at risk of being eroded. Therefore, it began to implement restrictions on the purchase of foreign exchange: first, it promulgated the "Measures for Requesting Approval for Purchasing Foreign Exchange," stipulating that those who need to purchase foreign exchange must first apply according to law, and purchase it at the legal price after being approved by the Central Bank, and then gradually strengthen it, stipulating that foreign exchange will not be provided for the import of non-essential goods, and other private remittances are also subject to strict restrictions. On July 2nd of this year, it was explicitly prohibited to import non-essential goods. On July 3rd, the "Rules for Applying to Purchase Foreign Exchange for Imported Goods" were promulgated, abolishing the previously promulgated "Measures for Requesting Approval for Purchasing Foreign Exchange," stipulating that the purchase of foreign exchange must be applied for to a "Foreign Exchange Examination Committee," and those approved must be settled with the Bank of China or the Bank of Communications at the legal price, but the applicant must pay a balancing fee equal to the difference between the legal price and the exchange rate quoted by the two banks. The above measures are quite effective in adjusting the international balance of payments, but unfortunately, they can only be implemented in the inland areas, while Shanghai, which holds the financial hub of the country, cannot implement them due to its special environment.</p>
<p>Cracking Down on Exports</p>
<p>Regarding the centralization of foreign currency income, control of export foreign exchange has now been implemented. This control method began in late April of last year, when the "Measures for Merchants to Export Goods and Settle and Sell Foreign Exchange" and the "Measures for Postal Parcels to Settle and Sell Foreign Exchange" were promulgated successively, stipulating that for goods to be exported, the foreign exchange to be obtained from the sale of goods must first be settled and sold to the Bank of China or the Bank of Communications at the legal price, and the transportation agency and customs can only accept and release the goods upon obtaining a foreign exchange purchase certificate and customs documents. Unfortunately, this method can only be implemented in the inland areas, and the foreign exchange obtained by Shanghai export merchants is sold on the high-priced black market. The government cannot intervene. Therefore, in Shanghai, the Chinese government in fact only has the obligation to supply foreign exchange for imports, but has no right to collect foreign exchange for exports. The only countermeasure is to reduce the amount of foreign exchange approved for imports, but this is precisely the factor that makes the Shanghai foreign exchange black market increasingly active. Due to the increasing expansion of the Shanghai foreign exchange black market, the inland export goods cannot compete with the goods directly exported from Shanghai due to the settlement of foreign exchange at the legal price. In order to encourage the export of inland native products, the Chinese government has formulated various guarantee and compensation measures for inland exporters. Recently, on July 2nd, the "Measures for Settling Foreign Exchange and Receiving Exchange Rate Differences for Exported Goods" were officially promulgated, stipulating that after the exporter settles and sells foreign exchange to the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications at the legal price, they can also receive the difference between the legal price and the exchange rate quoted by the settling bank based on the foreign exchange settlement certificate. The exchange rate quoted by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications is slightly higher than the Shanghai black market and lower than the legal price, which is sufficient to reduce the difficulty of exporting for inland exporters. This is indeed an effective method to encourage the export of inland native products and generate foreign exchange income.</p>

<p>Anecdotes of Celebrities The Duke and Duchess of Windsor's Disdain for Honors</p>
<p>Moving to a New Mansion in Paris, A Couple Resembling Immortals</p>
<p>The Duke of Windsor, who sacrificed the throne for love and disdained honors, is still talked about as a beautiful story to this day. Since the Duke married Mrs. Simpson, their marriage has been harmonious and their love has been enduring. Every time the weather is good, they go on outings together, climbing mountains, playing in the water, exploring secluded places, and enjoying the scenery. Their life of leisure, their peaceful state of mind, and their spiritual joy are something that those who hold important administrative positions today cannot dream of! The Duke and Duchess are truly a couple resembling immortals. It is recently learned that the Duke and Duchess moved into their new residence in Paris in February. The address is No. 24 Sujia Road, near the River of Charity. Although it is not as grand and magnificent as the palace gardens, the Duke and Duchess regard it as no different from an immortal mansion. Furthermore, the residence is actually spacious and magnificent, and the surrounding scenery is quiet and suitable as the Duke and Duchess's residence. The residence was built in 1929 in the style of Louis XVI, with twenty living rooms and six bathrooms, all equipped with the latest facilities. In addition, there are many extra rooms, enough for the Duke's three secretaries, two private detectives, two chauffeurs, and nine other servants to live in. The residence is not the Duke's own property, but a two-year lease has been signed. The dining room of the residence was decorated in March, and the rest of the rooms were not fully decorated until June. At this time, the weather is getting hot, and the Duke and Duchess are preparing to leave here for other suitable places for summer vacation. June 19th is the Duchess's 43rd birthday, and four days later is the Duke's 45th birthday. After holding a double celebration, they will go to Aileban City. There is a hot spring there, which is said to have the effect of curing rheumatism. The Duchess is going there, perhaps to bathe in it.</p>
<p>The Duke of Windsor has three pet dogs, which are very intelligent, docile, and understanding, and are deeply loved by their owner. However, one of them, named "Dido," unfortunately had its leg broken by a streetcar not long ago. Although it was treated and did not die, its leg was useless and it has become disabled. The Duke and Duchess feel sorry for it every time they look at it.</p>
<p>On the second floor of the new residence, in addition to the kitchen and the dining room, the offices of the two detectives, Tao Satte and Ge Weir, are also located. The third floor is the Duke and Duchess's bedroom, sitting room, and the magnificent living room and banquet hall. The most eye-catching thing in the living room is the circular gold box given by his parents, with the words "To Prince Edward" on the surface. A Photo of the Duke and Duchess Recently Duke Appeals for Peace</p>
<p>-Writes to the Italian King as a Commoner-</p>
<p>Paris News: The Duke of Windsor recently wrote to King Emmanuel III of Italy in his capacity as a commoner, appealing to him to use his great power to save Europe from war and avoid the suffering of the people. The original letter read: "Your Majesty, you are the one I most admire. I was once a soldier fighting by your side. Therefore, I now appeal to you in my capacity as a commoner to use your power to turn the tide and save this imminent disaster." Health Knowledge My View of Life Ding Fubao</p>
<p>Because people have different circumstances and different experiences, their views on life are also different. For example, modern young people who live a life of luxury and dissipation, indulging in games and banquets all day long, are not worthy of talking about their views on life. There are also those who are busy and rushed from morning to night, with no time to spare, supporting their parents and raising their children, all of which become problems. They are confused all year round and trapped by food and clothing, and they are also not worthy of talking about their views on life. There are also those who have enough food and clothing, do nothing with no purpose, without honor or disgrace, and spend their lives in vain. When a coffin is attached to them, everything is over. Such people are also not worthy of talking about their views on life. There are also those who take accumulating wealth as their view of life. When they are alive, they often accumulate wealth to millions or billions, but after their death, their children and grandchildren suspect each other, and their families collapse from within and without. In a few years, they will be gone with the wind. This is the mistake of taking accumulating wealth as a view of life. There is also a kind of official obsessed who takes being an official as the first profession in life, flattering and pleasing in every possible way, and damaging their personality. There is also a kind of gluttonous person who takes the desire of the mouth as the first enjoyment in life. As a result, they often suffer from high blood pressure, nephritis, hardening of the blood vessels, premature aging, and other diseases. These people are all making mistakes in their views on life.</p>
<p>I will briefly describe the most true and noble view of life of the Buddhist school: First, treat all living beings equally and do not have any ideas of poverty, wealth, nobility, lowliness, injustice, kinship, highness, or inferiority in your heart. Second, I have received this body in order to save all living beings, so I should devote myself to saving society throughout my life, exhausting myself and dying. Third, do not expect any reward from all the living beings who have been saved. These three points are what the Buddhist school calls developing Bodhicitta. Zhang Zixi Ming said: "People are my compatriots, and things are my companions." He also said: "All the disabled, sick, lonely, and widowed in the world are my brothers and sisters who are suffering and have no one to tell." This is also the same meaning. Proceed according to this purpose and do not give up halfway, which is an active view of life. A passive view of life is not enough to talk about this. Happy and Contented Nurturing of Character for Longevity Ding Huikang</p>
<p>One Must Seek Spiritual Pleasure and Satisfaction</p>
<p>Perfect happiness, a healthy physique, and a long life are what everyone hopes for, and spiritual peace, pleasure, and satisfaction are the important foundations for achieving these three. The general public's psychology is that spiritual peace, pleasure, and satisfaction are greatly related to their personal environment, but this is not entirely true. Often, people who have plenty of food and clothing cannot obtain as much satisfaction and comfort as those who have only simple meals and drinks. This kind of peaceful, pleasant, and satisfying spirit does not originate from the creation of the environment, but can be obtained by paying attention to it in our own minds and bodies. I will briefly describe it as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Be able to restrain one's emotions and always maintain a peaceful mood, so that one will not tend to extremes.</p>
<p>(2) Usually, have a possible goal in mind and do not make extravagant hopes to disturb the peaceful spirit.</p>
<p>(3) Live each day as if this day is the only purpose and concentrate on it. The achievements of the future are based on this.</p>
<p>(4) Always have thoughts of universal love and mutual assistance in your heart. Whether people love or hate me, never disturb my heart.</p>
<p>(5) Life has the happiness of family, the joy of making friends, the fascination with nature, and the appreciation of music and books, all of which can generate pleasant emotions. These pleasant emotions are the elements of spiritual peace, life, and health, and we should seek them ourselves.</p>
<p>Engaging in a noble spiritual career, such as reading books, practicing calligraphy, and studying interesting sciences, can all enable the body and mind to have something to rely on, and often feel the unique pleasure in it, so as to delight the spirit. Torture Lang Piaoran writes Strange News and Events Husbands Can Also Be Bought and Sold</p>
<p>In today's male society, the buying and selling of wives is not a rare thing. But sometimes it is the other way around, and husbands can also be bought and sold.</p>
<p>In some places in southern India, the number of women far exceeds the number of men, so men have become valuable commodities. A woman who wants to buy a bridegroom with a good family background must pay at least 500 to 1,000 rupees. If the bridegroom is of outstanding character, the price is surprisingly high - sometimes it costs the bride as much as 10,000 rupees! Nowadays, women in these places are also becoming increasingly Westernized, so men who have received Western education are more likely to find employers, and the price can also be raised. It is said that a bachelor's degree from a university studying in England is worth 1,000 rupees, and if he obtains a doctorate, it can be increased to 2,000 rupees.</p>
<p>Not only in the East can husbands be bought and sold, but also in the West, there are many such strange things. Not long ago, an Irishman in New York posted an advertisement for sale at a price of 300 pounds, seeking female customers. It is said that his original wife, suffering from homesickness, wanted to return to Ireland alone. He could not raise the travel expenses for his wife, so he had to sell himself!</p>
<p>There is also an American youth who came up with a unique marriage proposal plan. He wanted to issue sixty lottery tickets, each selling for 50 US dollars. Any girl or widow under the age of 32 could purchase them. The winning woman could not only get a young man as her husband, but also get 3,000 US dollars in cash from the sale of lottery tickets.

<p>Mr. Cai Yuanpei is a highly respected veteran educator and the sole leader of the academic world. Everyone respects Mr. Cai. Mr. Cai's wife, Ms. Zhou Jun, is virtuous, capable, gentle, and can be said to be a typical new woman. Here, it is worth introducing Mrs. Cai's education: She studied at the Shanghai Patriotic Girls' School, the Zhenjiang Chengzhi Girls' School, and the Qiming Girls' School in her early years. After graduating, she served as a teacher at the Shenzhou Girls' School and the Anqing Provincial Women's Normal School, and also served as a private tutor at Zhang Jusheng's home, serving education for more than ten years. In the twelfth year of the Republic of China, she went to Europe with Mr. Cai for their honeymoon. First, she went to Belgium and entered the National Academy of Fine Arts, and then went to the Paris Academy of Fine Arts. She also studied Western painting under a famous painter. She had loved art since she was a child, and with the guidance of famous teachers, her skills improved greatly. Finally, she went to the University of Hamburg in Germany to specialize in "Ethnology." After returning to China, she took charge of household affairs and no longer took up teaching positions. She said that it was not that she did not want to serve, but that household affairs were too complicated to take care of.</p>
<p>Mrs. Cai has three key opinions on women's issues: First, improve their knowledge; second, get rid of extravagance; and third, be diligent and endure hardship. She said that although these three points seem to be old sayings, they are actually unbreakable truths. A woman must first have knowledge, and can be competent for any opportunity. Otherwise, even if she wants to fight for equal rights with men and improve her position, it will be in vain. For example, Sweden once had a woman who was the Minister of Education, and France has also had three female cabinet members in recent years. One of them that I know is the daughter of Madam Curie. They are all women with extensive academic knowledge, which is why they have been able to achieve outstanding positions. It is definitely not something that can be hoped for by chance. Loving luxury and admiring vanity are the most common faults of women, especially those who grow up in cities. They are influenced by fame and fortune and find it most difficult to get rid of the habit of frivolity. You must know that frivolity and vanity are not good things. Since ancient times, in urban society, countless evils have occurred and numerous tragedies have been caused because of them! I hope that female compatriots will be strong in will and not fall into a deep pit. As for diligence, it is a virtue of mankind. On a small scale, it can reduce the burden on men and increase the happiness of the family; on a large scale, it can be beneficial to the general public in society and contribute to national construction. I think rural women are the most able to work. Taking Suzhou Tianping Mountain as an example, women engage in embroidery or push carts during the slack season. A portion of men carry birdcages and go to tea houses, being well-fed and doing nothing. That kind of situation is not exceptional. In rural areas everywhere, men and women probably work equally.</p>
<p>Having seen the blockbuster "One Night of Passion," everyone praised the briskness of the technique, the extreme relaxation of the mood, and the skill of the style. The blockbuster "Midnight Passion" from Paramount has the same effect. The starring characters are all famous stars. The female lead, Claudette Colbert, has gained a large audience on the screen for her playful and charming acting skills. The male lead is Don Ameche, who starred in "The Chicago Fire" and "Musical Moments from Chopint." John Barrymore and Mary Astor occupy important supporting roles. Barrymore's new wife, Elaine Barrie, also makes her first appearance in this comedy. The whole performance is full of humor. A new style of dance is also introduced, called "HaConga," which evolved from a Cuban folk dance. The tune is very hot and will definitely be popular in dance halls in the future. The above is the theme song of "Midnight Passion," which has a beautiful and very pleasant melody. Mr. Wang Qinglong of the China Harmonica Association has compiled the harmonica notation. The date of the film's release and the theater will be announced in the entertainment section of this newspaper at that time. Science and Life New Medical Discoveries Using Microscopes to Identify Diseases</p>
<p>The French Academy of Medicine in Paris recently announced that regarding the technique of medical diagnosis, Swiss famous chemist Dr. Pan Pfeifer has been conducting continuous research, and now there is a new discovery of great value. According to the new method proposed by Dr. Pan, take a drop of blood from the patient's finger and add copper chloride to turn it into a crystalline form. If it is an ordinary healthy person, the shape of this crystalline blood under the microscope is always parallel lines. As for the patient's blood, its shape varies depending on the disease. For example, the crystalline blood of tuberculosis is in the shape of a "Malta" hollow cross, tumor disease is in the shape of a right angle, epilepsy is in the shape of a fan, and diabetes is slightly spherical. It has been tested thousands of times and is accurate. Therefore, using this method to explore the patient's symptoms can be as clear as one's palm.</p>

<h3>Robber Cup International Doubles: China Gains Final Spot; Straight Sets Victory Over Britain Yesterday; Japan Defeats US, Also Gains Final Spot</h3>
<p>As a result of yesterday's semi-finals in the Robber Cup International Tennis Doubles Tournament, the Chinese and Japanese teams secured their places in the final, which will be held next week to determine the champion. China eliminated Britain in straight sets, while Japan also defeated the United States in straight sets. The scores are as follows:</p>
<p>The China-Britain match was completely one-sided, lasting only forty minutes. The difference in strength was vast, and Bond was unable to resist at all. Lin Shihua's wonderful shots came one after another. Bennawi was old and not as good as before. In the last game, Lin Shu won four "aces." After the game, because the Japanese players had not arrived, the four players performed another set, which Wang Lin won 6-2. Based on today's performance, there is no doubt that China will be the champion. Japan and the United States continued to fight. Japan's victory was completely unexpected. The Japanese players concentrated their attacks on Squia, who made numerous mistakes, resulting in a miserable defeat. Naizhi was better than Chai Ne in steadiness and could be relied upon, attacking entirely with low, sliced balls, preventing Cash from volleying. The overhead smash was also excellent, but Chai Ne made many mistakes and will not be a match for the Chinese team. In the first set, the US took the lead at 5-4, but Japan won 7-5. In the second set, the US took the lead at 6-5 but lost three consecutive games to Japan. In the third set, the US trailed 1-5 and chased back three consecutive games, but ultimately failed.</p>

Zheng Yiquan and Guo Bingkun received assistance from Mai Bingyao and led 11-5. Then they tied the score at 17-17. The third game was a matter of life and death for both sides. Fang Gang took the lead, and Fudan followed closely. When they changed sides, they were four points behind. The competition became even more intense after that. Fudan surpassed several times, but at 6-6, 7-7, Tan Yongzhan misjudged the decision and caught the ball, losing a good opportunity and losing a point.
