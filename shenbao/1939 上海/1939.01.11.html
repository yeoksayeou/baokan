<p>社評</p>
<h3>張伯倫氏進行之綏靖</h3>
<p>英國首相張伯倫氏與外相哈里法克斯氏，旣於昨日聯袂首途、離英倫而經法京巴黎，小作勾留，與法總理達拉第氏傾談之後，遄赴義京羅馬，與義首相墨索里尼作良晤。此行乃張伯倫氏於去歲兩度飛德，與德元首希特勒氏躬親折衝，締立慕尼黑協定後之預定計畫。其最高願望乃在斡旋英法德義四國，以綏靖歐洲大局；將於足爲綏靖障碍之一切問題，竭奔走跋涉之勞，求排難解紛之道；老翁壯舉，有足多也。</p>
<p>山窮水盡疑無路，柳暗花明又一邨，此是何等快意之境界，我人竭誠藤祝張伯倫氏之竟入佳境。顧以目前情况言之，歐洲大局，乃如治絲而益棼，頗疑綏靖之無路。當張伯倫氏預定聘義之日，捷克斯拉夫纔上和平祭壇而作神聖犧牲，烽火於以銷歇，局勢驟見緩弛；推張伯倫氏之意，以爲驚魂甫定，喘息稍蘇，祗須把握時機，便得調停矛盾，大難已過，黎明可期。乃二三月來，英國雖於西班牙事假作痴聾，承認英義協定之發生效力，以示惠義國；法國雖對德意志消釋宿讐，發爲法德共同宣言，以示信德國；然隨捷克斯拉夫犧牲之後者，波蘭，匈加利，烏克蘭諸問題，接踵而趨於尖銳；德國對於殖民地問題，始終表示不甘放棄；而義國朝野，復公然覬覦菲洲法領；法國則斷然聲明决不割讓寸土，且謝絕張伯倫氏爲法義問領土問題之調人。此外懸案新爭旣不勝舉，而更與國際種種爭議相應而生者，有各國各竭其資力而制爲空前龐大之軍費預算焉。劍拔弩張，引滿待發，似乎非有偉大之斷送，即有慘痛之戰爭者；張伯倫氏預定聘義之日。歐　固非顯然日趨艱難若今日之甚者也。</p>
<p>國際聘問，不容出爾反爾；夫旣成的於二月之前，張伯倫氏於是乎行矣。我人無自而知旅途中之張伯倫氏，是何情緒？明知爲山窮水盡而聊盡人事歟？悠然於柳暗花明而智珠在握歟？將曉之以國際競擴軍備之利害，示之以英法不再讓步之决心，以冀對方之心廻意轉而捐棄其攘奪之意念歟？抑行囊之中，別具神聖犧牲如捷克斯拉夫者，以暫時饜足義國所謂合理而又正當之欲求歟？舉不可知也。</p>
<p>世界和平不可分，張伯倫氏之歐洲綏靖政策亦不可分；：是以張伯倫氏之政策，必於全盤豁然貫通之日，始有功效，抑且有無上之價値；不然，或恊於柏林巴黎而挫於羅馬，或諧於巴黎羅馬而躓於柏林，或英法德義各如所願，而與其他國家相柄鑿，則任何星火，仍可燎原，而卒歸於全盤失敗。惟其如此，張伯倫氏此行之成敗，將予整個世界以嚴重影響，而世界各方之禱祝此君此行乃得意外之圓滿，自屬必然。不幸而不如舉世所屬望，則不但此行爲徒勞，不但爲張伯倫氏政策之不行，且可以反證以四國路綫綏靖歐局之無望。繼四國綏靖路綫無望之後者，當爲歐洲綏靖政策之根本改弦易轍；即不再適用委曲求全，妥協苟安之外交，而待事實證明今日之趾高氣揚者爲虛張聲勢歟？今日之劍拔弩張者確爲人類文明之逆轉而以生死相搏之前夕歟？我人厚望張伯倫氏不虛此行，願根本懷疑於委曲之不足以求全，四國之不足以綏靖歐局，僅僅綏靖歐局之不足以保障人類文明；蓋必擴綏靖之範圍爲一大環，至少於英法德義四國之外，西聯美國，北合蘇俄，東顧中華，而後有長治久安之可期也！</p>

<p>（羅馬）　値茲英首相張伯倫外相哈里法克斯聘問義國之前夕、此　有經騐的觀察家均宣稱、餵索里尼首相與張伯倫首相進行談話時、似當就菲洲問題、在法理上經濟上提出各項要求、共在領土上則僅要求兼併東菲洲法屬索謀里蘭併直布底港在內、而不牽涉都尼西亞或科西嘉島、俾英義兩國協定所保障之地中海領土現狀得以保持、並當援引「慕尼黑協定精神」、力言義國各項要求「公允而又正當」、必須予以滿足而後、地中海始有恢復穩定局勢之可能、此外、並當敦促張伯倫首相在法義兩國之間從事調處、而將義國對法各項要求與西班牙問題打成一片、並以承認西國國民軍爲交戰團體、作爲撤退義國志願兵之交換條件、至其他純屬英義兩國問題、例如東菲洲英義兩國屬地劃界問題。英義兩國商務問題、亦當乘機提出討論、主瞥方面甚至預言談話結果、英義兩國或當締結商務協定、亦屬可能云、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　此間政界消息靈通人士頃宜稱、英義兩國各閣員日內進行談話時、西班牙內戰宜由慕尼黑恊定各簽字國即英法德義四國出面調處問題、或當提付討論、西班牙中止內戰旣爲綏靖歐洲時局先决條件之一、英義兩國當局以此爲談話主題、自屬意料中事加之西國內戰當事雙方、均欲在談話開始之前、佔有堅强形勢以爲發言地步、此可於國民軍在加泰隆自治邦前綫進攻、政府軍在西部埃斯脫拉瑪杜省前綫進攻見之、據傳西國內戰當事雙方、均當派遣非正式觀察員前往羅馬、注視談話進行情形、國民軍政府方面聞常遣派駐英代表亞爾巴公爵、共和政府方面擬派何人、尙無所聞知、墨索里尼首相或當向張伯倫首相表示願將義國志願兵撤退，而在其他方面獲有利益、以爲交換條件、果爾則西國共和政府內閣總理奈格林、關於第三國調處內戰所提出之首要條件、即外國志願兵悉數退出一項條件、即可予以滿足、至國民軍政府態度如何、雖不可知、但調處之事、若能見諸事實、定必由英法德義四國聯合出之、則有可斷言云、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>上海特輯　上海之金融市塲（續昨）</h3>
<p>— 張一凡</p>
<p>（六）外滙統制與黑市塲活動本年三月初實施之外匯統制，在我國幣制史上，應繼改革幣史後値得大書特書之事。作者於本報經濟專刋及其他報章雜誌，先後巳發表拙著多决，可供參考。耍之：一切外滙需要，皆須向由中央銀行申請，而由中央銀行核准，凡經核准者，該行即按一先令二便士半法定率如數供給。是以向國處定貨，亦需先經核准；洋貨之進口，凡無核准證明書者即不得起貨。此不特爲節省外滙以供軍用，抑且具有保護民族產業及提倡儉撲與節的之風。至於出口方面，所生之外滙，皆需結售與中央銀行，由該行給以證書，乃得起運。吾則海關與路局，皆得以攔截，禁止其輸出。同時爲保護出口商之利益計，出口上之運輸，保險，以及在外市塲上出售時所受之損失，皆由國家給以補償及特殊優待。此不僅在促進輸出貿易，顯然亦大可增進國內之生產。凡我國民，殊應予以切實之合作與遵守。唯如是，始得保障吾人之財富，並藉此而獲得長足之發展。</p>
<p>不幸上海處於淪陷區內，加以外商銀行又以本國之商業利益爲前提。當我國實施外匯申核制度時，即拒絕合作，從而被人利用，積極推行其破壞法幣之工作，喪心病在之徒，竟復乘機活動，爭購外匯，逃亡其資金；甚至賣空買空，大事投機。於是外滙黑市上法幣大起跌風，竟造成積重難返之勢，有如下表：外滙，乃受中央暗中授意，恐未必確實。不過爲投機者所製造之空氣耳。</p>
<p>且自白銀協定繼續生效，中美，中英借款成立；加以日方各界自覺現行破壞法幣之工作，僅能影響中國之對外貿易，並不能搖撼全中國人民對於法幣之信心，故反有主張利用法幣，以貫澈其統治中國淪陷區內經濟活動者。加以中國對於法幣發行，始終愼重其事。决不稍事膨脹。而民間則始終窖藏法幣，視同現金；對於僞貨劣幣，拒不接受。雖在淫威下被迫使用者，亦僅左手來而右手出。是以外滙暗市上之變動，受損失者不過是投機者及進口商人，在國內價値，則並未稍起若何作用·至於今日國內物價之高漲，則由於商品本身之供需失調故耳。</p>
<p>（七）證券市塲之復活與資金公債市塲，原亦爲投機者活動塲所·在實施統一公債制度前，月份成交數，每年合計，常達四五百萬元。自收換舊公債，改發統一新公債，將過去參差不齊之各項債價，統一於甲乙丙丁戊五種，而由政府無形中加以駕馭。於是債市即不復如前之暴漲暴落，投機者驟失其掀風作浪之憑藉。故如二十五年全年成交數，巳一落而爲二百十餘萬元，惟自二十六年初夏，上海各交易所引出在烈投機風潮時，債市亦不免受其波及。故該年一月至七月的成交數，合計即達二百餘萬元之多。滬戰旣起，交易所停業，但爲時不久，現貨交易即在暗中進行。此種交易，雖屬非法；但在上海金融市塲之特殊機構裹，尙有其情有可原之處。</p>
<p>蓋上海銀錢業，各以公債爲變相之現金準備。非特視爲一種證劵投資，同時亦視爲調節資金貸借之一種方法。游資多時購儲公債，缺時即售之市塲。證券交易所之停市在銀錢業方面，不啻驟失一周轉資金之公開市塲。故戰爭初起後之暗中實行現貨賣買，或由於調遣資金上所必要。</p>
<p>唯有一事令人不解者，當時之此種暗盤價，聞有較戰前價跌去三十元之多者。持劵者何故不向銀錢業之聯合準備組織，甚至貼放委員會要求抵押信用？而甘於作賤出售其債券？可知此種交易，未必盡屬現貨，換言之：未必純屬周旋資金之意味在。唯其如是，故當初之交易額，爲數至屬微細。</p>
<p>自上海淪陷，國法效力無形降低，加以受外匯黑交易之刺激，公債投機者，始公然露其頭角。本年三四月間，即有所謂「茗談會」之組織（參看拙著「上海證券市塲之今昔」不日將於本報發表）。實行非法交易。</p>
<p>此種非法交易之存在，直接上足以影饗公債信用；間接上足以動搖各銀行之準備價値。故華商證券交易所曾要求復業。政府雖不許可，但對該所企圖以半公開市塲消滅前項「茗談會」之非法行爲，似亦予以諒解。因前項交易，純由投機者組織，故其行動，頗具危險性；易使債信受惡劣之打擊。如半公開市塲出現，而許原有證券經紀商經營賣買，則較易統制。於債信之維持，亦較容易。故該項市塲開始活動以來，各債市價即開始回堅，而今允烈。雖迭受戰局變化，亦得一一渡過各關。雖然，離戰前公佈之最低價則尙甚鉅。是以多方均不甘上塲，每日僅有散戶進出耳。</p>
<p>自外匯慘跌以後，歐美各國輸華之物價大漲。此不啻將在華之市塲，自行奉送於日本·蓋日本在淪陷區內，出入自由，且可拒納各稅；歐美貨物之成本原較日貨貴，又加匯價之飛漲而益貴。雖能利用誓不再購仇貨之華人心理，得以稍稍活動；在匯價激漲之時，究難與百貨作自由競爭。故當法幣猛烈跌價後，歐美商人即大悟前非。不得不出而爲自己之利益，維持法幣之滙價。我國對於暗市之活動，固可置之不理。因不特對外貿易之反可獲利，且財政在外支付，自有外匯基金可用，並不因暗市匯率之影響而稍受損失。抑且如實行維持，不啻助長外匯投機，則在先又何必實施外滙統制。故外界所傳匯豐與香港之拋售</p>

<p>緊急信號</p>
<p>英艦鷗號收得信號、立即馳往、該地在吳淞口上游四十哩、首次發無錢電信號時爲午後四時、旋海盜向漢和開槍射擊、欲迫其改向江邊行駛、至四時五十分、英艦駛抵漢和輪附近、但盜船已</p>

<h3>今日北站的貨運　路員稅吏重要剝榨　運費分等別有用心</h3>
<p>— 夏畦</p>
<p>自從淪陷了的京滬，滬杭兩條鐵道，侵略者在軍運之餘，允許搭客和運貨以後，斷垣殘壁，死寂了的北火車站，又有一點子熱鬧了。</p>
<p>過去，替這個大都市—上海，負起貨物吸進吐出重任的，在鐵路方面，有麥根路車站。北站。日暉港車站。和南站，現在，南站是完全被封鎖着，麥根路車站，雖然很早就傳說不久要開放，但是至今還沒有實現，日暉港車站因爲佔有在黃浦江邊的便利，有一點貨物在卸車，但是沒有東西起運，原因是，到現在還沒有得到允許，除此只有北火車站了。現在只有北站，是比較的忙碌和熱鬧，它有貨物裝出去，亦有東西運進來。</p>
<p>裝到北站來的貨物，卸車情形，一般的說來，是和過去沒有多大異樣，只是卸下來的貨物，沒有棧房堆，只好堆在露天空地上，還有侵略者曾經用作駡我中國沒有組織的一種藉口，認爲最不合理的稅收—釐金，取銷以後，好幾年不見了的收稅員，現在在侵略者的槍刺上，一批簇新的人物，又站了起來，向每一件貨物伸手要錢。</p>
<p>貨物起運時的情形，是絕不像過去那樣的簡單和順利，如果有貨物要運出去，必先要前幾天去登記，管理登記的人允許你登記以後，就給你一張像豆腐干一樣大小的「貨位證一，上面寫明允許你把貨物車到北站來的日期，到了那個指定的日期，你才可以把貨物車去。但是，事前還要拿了這張「貨位證」，到管理貨位的人那裹去，要他指派一個位置，這時候如果你光是拿一張貨位證一去，是不會得到位置的，必須要附去五元或十元法幣，才能如願以償。管理貨位的人允許了你位置以後，就在這張「貨位證」上，註明貨位的號碼，這樣才算手續完備，你可把你的貨物，帶到指派的貨位上去安放，要是沒有得到管理貨位人的許可，這一張登記時所發的一貨位證一，是等於廢紙，不要說沒有位置給你堆放，就是守車塲柵門的兵七，亦不會讓你帶着貨物通過。—北站在八一三以前，就因爲棧房太少，常常有許多待運的貨物，堆放在露天，或是棧房外的馬路上，戰後，這稀少的棧房，毀的毀了，剩下來的，又大半不肯公開堆放貨物，所以你雖然化了幾塊錢去買得來的貨位，亦僅僅是露天一塊空地罷了。</p>
<p>貨物堆放在貨位上以後，再去要求派車子裝，這亦須要化上二三十元莫明其妙的錢，吾則即使擱上幾天，亦不會派到車子，而華人辦的轉運公司，又不能直接去要求派車子，非得要轉託日籍述輸公司，最低限度，亦得雇用幾個□□人，這當然又得化上許多寃枉錢。還有，裝出法的貨物，須要有「採辦證」，而大多數華人所辦的轉運公司，都無從領得，只得臨時每一車出二三十元，向別人轉買。</p>
<p>運費的計算，過去是很詳細的分爲六等，現在只的略的改分做三等，但是，不滿整車是不分等級的：</p>
<p>絹。綢緞。雜貨。等是一等運價。</p>
<p>人迭絹。綿紗。洋布。土布。蛋。乾繭。麵粉。洋燭。香烟。砂糖。煤。鐵……是二等運價。</p>
<p>棉花。小麥。黃豆。米。鹽……是三等運價。</p>
<p>照上面的分法，我們很明顯的看得出他的作用，運費最便宜的所謂第三等貨物，完全是中國的大宗出產，而是侵略者最迫切需要的東西。</p>
<p>運費現在從上海到杭州，二等價整車，每噸日幣二元五角五分，到南京三元六角，無錫二元六角，蘇州二元二角，嘉興二元三角五分，松江二元三角，外加裝車力，卸車力等雜費四種，每種每噸一角六分，共六角叫分。還有，通運株式會社不論遠近，整車每噸要加收九角，不滿整車，每担要加收五角。所謂通運株式會社，是鐵路方面的貨運經理人，所有全綫貨運人員的任用，以及開支，全都由他負責。</p>
<p>所有兩路裝貨的車輛，在華軍西退的時候，都帶了去，現在所用的，是從別處運來的小車子，每輛十五噸，照十三噸收運費。</p>
<p>因爲車輛的少，因爲車輛的小，所造成的不敷分配，因爲華人所開設的轉運公司，不能够直接去耍求派車子，因爲某些人的目的，是在發橫財，所以，正像各處地方一樣，造成了許許多多敲榨剝削的情形。車站裏邊的「職員」，是拿每天貨物的多少，車輛的多少，來决定他特別費的價目，而許多某國籍的運輸公司或個人，靠着他天賦便利派得的車子，不去裝自己的貨，——或者根本沒有貨裝，——用高價象出頂房子一樣的，把它轉讓給倒霉的中國人。</p>
<p>現在，運到北站來的貨物，或是從北站運出去的貨物，都要付原價百分之五的稅，由偽「上海市政」派人駐在那裏收取。那批收稅的小醜，除了敲榨，原本楚什麽都不懂，所以在估價的時候，往往任意亂佔，你要和他講理，理在那地方根本就講不通，不過這樣子並不是就算他們「忠於職守」。事情常常是這樣的、譬如你有一批貨，他要估你三千元的原價，捐一百五十元，講定後，他寫了五十元的捐票，收你五十塊錢，另外的，他只告訴你在某某地方接洽，那地方常是白渡橋南的大飯店或是旅館裹。有時，說不定竟是妓院，你到晚上八。九點鐘去，本來還要付他一百塊錢，但是因爲道是入私囊的關係，所以可以打個對折，只要付他五十塊錢就够了。</p>
<p>你在那地方了錢，如果你要明白他們的錢到那裹去的，只要在那地方四面看一看，就可知道，抽大煙，賭錢，喝酒，玩女人，什麼都全套，收稅的小醜和鐵路上的□籍職員，完全一樣，他們不但刮了錢去自己胡調，有時還耍拉了許多轉運公司的職員一同去，鬧到天亮，使人在物質方面特別付去之外，在精神方面，亦要特別付出一筆。</p>
<p>因爲北站不再死寂了，所以扎江路上打壞了的屋子，亦有人去租界，這一代的房屋，現在算被沒收了，所以租界的時候，是要向「日本居留民團」去租，房租每日大約十幾塊錢，但是他交給你的，只是一間破屋子，並不修好，是要你自己去修，因此，有人租了一間屋子，修一修倒化掉了四·五百元，這種租房的情形，亦真是前所少有。</p>
<p>現在北站的貨運，比較上是相當的忙碌，同時，某種人的口袋，以及飯店。旋館。妓院。煙。賭。酒。亦跟在一起忙碌，而另一方面，亦正是勞工們血和汗的加速底奔流。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>同情</h3>
<p>— 阿</p>
<p>「同情」，這是一個挺好聽的名詞。</p>
<p>但是「同情」，在這一個世紀中，却該從一般的字典中，刪節掉。因「同情」的刪節掉，「博愛」，「人道」，「互助」等名詞，似乎也沒有任其在字典之中，再佔據一行地位的必要。——不過「互助」一字，在屠殺人類的强盜字典中，或許有時還得應用一下子。但是，這絕對不是可與「同情」等發生關係的「互助的原來的意義。</p>
<p>從歷史上看來，解衣推食的故事，是很多的。雖然這些故事之是吾具有眞實性，無從懸斷，但把這些故事流傳着，以培養後代人的「同情心，究竟也還未始不於世道」人心，略有裨益。</p>
<p>然而以事實而論，這些故事的流傳，對於世道人心的裨益，也是微渺得不足道。如火如荼的同情於在死亡綫上掙扎的難民，固極可佩，然而出售難民食糧的舞弊案，在報上，已被露了不止一二件了。這樣「喪心病在」的行爲，殊足爲「同情」一哭。</p>
<p>近來，更常見那些「慈善家」們，坐了汽車，上第一流的菜館去，討論着救濟難民一的「義舉」。而在酒酣耳然之時，討論未畢之際，更常有人招幾個條子來侑酒，或是招幾個嚮導來陪陪，以助餘興。而更有些紳士們，竟也居然會得詳詢着這些墮落女子的身世，而爲之勉强地表示着唏噓，噬嘆，以示其富有同情心。——雖然他們的吃喝玩耍，「無疑地是自「掏腰包」，然而即以此吃喝玩耍之資，移助難民，似乎並無不合呀，然而大人先生所不爲也。</p>
<p>商界提倡着百一提成運動，然而每一商店的小職員，却常在裁員」的恐怖氣氛中掙扎。「失了業，倒有人救濟，這話並非幽默，多少帶着若干嚴肅。不過在事實上，也不盡然。從搶皮夾，要求吃宮司」的事件看來，雖然失業，雖然不能生活，若沒有悲慘故事的演出，要找尋、同情也是不易。</p>
<p>娛樂捐的數字，龐大得殊足驚人，在表面上看來，上海人的「娛樂不忘難民」的精神，是値得頌揚的了。然而在這大時代中，還是那麽的醉生夢死，小之何以表示同情於難民，大之，何以表示同情於國家與民族？每月上海人對於救濟事業，對於國家，對於找尋娛樂與刺激的獻金之數字，似乎應列表而表示其統計，測騐上海人的同情心，究竟是寄託於難民，國家，還是自私的享樂。</p>
<p>一盌飯運動，是現代世界人類所表示的最偉大的同情心，然而一方面推行一盌飯運動，一方面却以大量的軍火售給侵略者，以供屠戮他們所同情的人們。這種同情，未免消極得有些滑稽了。</p>
<p>從前有十位富翁，瞧着流離失所的女孩子們可憐，於是基於人類的同情，而一一領到了家來，供以衣食。結果，這些女孩予都成了這位富翁的姨太太。現代的所謂「同情」，一博愛一，最低的限度，總有百分之若干，是以這一個故事爲典型的，雖然其性質與方式，或是互異的。</p>
<p>因此「同情」等名詞，在現代的字典中，是應　節掉的。最低的限度也應變更其原有的界說，而使之趨於現實化。</p>
<h3>磨刀</h3>
<p>— 無衣</p>
<p>夜是冷寂的，淪陷了的故鄉的夜更冷寂得像死去了的一樣。我咬緊了牙關忍住了偷爬過窗隙的西北風傳來的寒氣，靜靜兒抱着奶婆爲我預備的破被絮喘息着。</p>
<p>在黑暗裹，我聽到了風嘯鬼泣合成的凄長的節拍，我看到的是起沒在西村瓦礫堆裏的燐火。一萬個恐怖侵襲着我，我恍然感到自己踏進了鬼蜮的世界。眞是鬼蜮的世界呀！</p>
<p>「霍，霍，沙……」一個怨抑的聲音淸晰地從蹲在西村梢的黑獸——燒剩的空茅屋內傳來。</p>
<p>「有鬼！我驚異地喊了，縮身在破棉絮裹去。</p>
<p>「不是鬼，」奶婆說，不過近來這些空屋子裏，常常要發出這種聲音。村上小伙仔都於上决赤老兵來時殺傷的殺傷；逃走的逃走了，老的們也沒有個敢近前去看個究竟！</p>
<p>我由恐懼而疑問，由疑問而思索，而開始追求着一個合理的解决，爲了村人的安全。於是我先是在沉靜中假裝了睡熟，再趁奶婆打起了盹囈時，閃身從板門中挨出。</p>
<p>經過了醉步一樣的躑躅，跨過了瓦礫和殘骸，在麻神木慮中我給凛冽的風吹呆到那座茅屋外三十步光景的地方了。這裏，我的耳鼓給一種鏗鏘的聲音興奮着，那聲音已經由沙霍而變成響亮，我發覺那是全屋磨擦的聲音。</p>
<p>「站住，」有人在我面前喝令。</p>
<p>待我的雙目在電光燈的閃照下浮過一陣昏花，我纔勉强鎮定起來認辨，巳經指在我胸口一支手槍和那拿槍的漢子。</p>
<p>「呀！做夢，你不是東林哥麼？幾時回來的？」那漢子突然放下槍執搖着我的手說。</p>
<p>「唔，西村金哥，你還…」</p>
<p>我認出了他是西村金哥，可是西村早給赤老兵燒了，金哥也一晌失踪了，也有人疑心他已經死的。不過現在立在我面前的不是他是誰？他又幹麽擎着手槍守在夜的路上。</p>
<p>「東林哥，不必疑慮，我是阿金，我還活着。敵人雖燒了我的家，就可惜他未及宰了我年靑的生命，留給我洗滌生命史上血債的機會。」</p>
<p>他興奮　噎了一口長氣，繼續說：</p>
<p>「近來我已不再爲家的毀滅而悲哀，我已經從之叩獲得了更寶貴　財產，那就是背上的一柄大刀和這管手槍。我相信牠們將爲我開墾出生命上的寶藏——心頭的一把火焰。」</p>
<p>他一面說，一面伸出手熱烈地拍着我的肩胛。</p>
<p>「我相信你，我完全相信你。」我感動而赧然的說。</p>
<p>接着金哥又告訴我，那村梢沒人住的那座凶屋，如今是他們小隊的宿舍了。不是宿舍，是團體工作的塲所，日間，他們到大隊部和有敵人駐紮的鎭上刺探消息，夜裹就來這兒聚集和休息。不過爲了縝密起見，行動方面還是暫時保守着秘密。</p>
<p>金哥拉着我要我去他們的辦公室或休息所的那座茅屋裹看看。自然，沒有切實工作經騐的我是很願意去，何况年靑人之間的友愛吸引着我。</p>
<p>當我們走進那茅屋子，在微弱飄嫋的燭光下，我看到一張一張閃光着的臉，他們都在敵人的獸行中受過了最大的苦難，使他們更愉快而滿意着他們目前熱烈的工作。</p>
<p>他們共是十來個人，大多撩起凸出肌肉的臂膀，在磨着大刀。「磨宰鬼的大刀呀！」我好比剛從一個夢裹淸醒過來。</p>
<p>看情形金哥是這小隊的隊長，他略略把我介紹之後，有兩個漢子跑上來和我握緊了手，那都是西村的幼時伙伴，曾在S鎭初中畢業的，如今我們又在一綫上做伙伴了。「鏘鏘鏘，」磨大刀的聲音又在小的一間茅屋內起了共鳴。音響是高亮的，從主人勉强按抑下有力地迸出。</p>
<p>「那兒來的這許多刀？」大都是從先死者的身上解下，也有民衆捐助給大隊的。至於少數不够分配的槍械，那却是敵人呈獻的勞力酬報。」</p>
<p>於是我明白他們行動秘密的原因了：原來爲了大刀的安全，咱國家的漢奸也的確多得驚人的，無怪他們耍格外縝密了。暫時他們這一隊放下擴大組織的原因也許就在這裹。</p>
<p>「我也幫你們磨則個。」我也提了把刀蹲向一塊磨石旁去，這時回味起的是小時磨草刀的心情。</p>
<p>「鏘鏘鏘，」屋內的磨刀聲更饗亮了，我們合成的一道聲響吞沒了屋外怒吼着的西風。</p>
<p>這樣，我在熱情的快感中消磨了回鄕的一晚，回味起來，喉間有千百種甜密和溫馨。於是我恍然覺到故鄕還是永遠在春天裏，在春的氣息裹滋長；雖然這滋長是新生，和從前的舊老的生命的苟延是有着天大的不同了。</p>
<h3>我愛火光</h3>
<p>— 羅昔</p>
<p>我愛野火會在黑夜里燃放起萬丈光芒，它能照明；誰是眞正的人類，誰是人面的豺狼！</p>
<p>火雖會焚燬繁華的城市，火雖會焚燬秀麗的山莊；但這是新與舊的交替，並不是永久的災荒！</p>
<p>到處也會跑來吃人的豺狼，到處也會冲起野火的光芒；誰也沒有地方可以逃避，可以躲藏！</p>
<p>火地上，萬萬千千被壓迫的兒女們已對着冲天的火光齊聲歌唱；</p>
<p>「只有抵抗，才有解放！我們的意志就是堅强的哨崗；我們的拳頭就是旡比的刀槍！」</p>
<p>向着兇野的豺狼，萬萬千千的人們已匯成一片滔天的巨浪。他們會把豺狼壓下尸骨堆成的山嶂，他們會把渣滓浸入熱血流成的江洋；在野火消熄以後，他們更會在膏染着血與肉的大地上，建起更繁華的城市；造起更秀麗的山莊！</p>
<p>是的，我愛火光！</p>
<h3>半條油炸檜</h3>
<p>— 雨林</p>
<p>在兇狠野蠻的敵人的槍，拳，棒，威脅監視之下，過着楚四的餘生。死活只在他們一念之轉，懇求是反要鞭撻的。身體已够疲乏了，所以迫着把險惡，親情，妻愛，希望，都一起暫時拋割，陲一覺再說。但大腦却不能允許你休息，一幕幕的往事，又在重複地表演了。</p>
<p>呀！學校關門了，老友，老師，　去內地了，幾個雜誌又以戰事的關係而停刊了，只有十多塊錢了，怎麽辦？我眼望着妻子含悲，兩兒還在旁邊分着一包三十文的油氽黃豆吃。妻子忍着苦，含着笑，拍拍袋，向前說，「環有什麼用？兌了吧！金子很貴，今天聽說一百五十四元，比一比，還可以賺着一半多哩！」</p>
<p>月底來到，環之什七付了房租；强集資料的稿子是大半打回票了，妻子說我們去做難民吧！橫豎李家張家都在，怕什麽難爲情，持久的方法，還是這樣好。唉！我心里想；怕難爲情又有什麼辦法呢！承好友的介紹，實現了妻子的勸告。又遭着飛來的用途，錢是化得差不多了。</p>
<p>黃豆飯，石屑很多，大兒略知事，沒菜祇少吃些，小兒哭不下嚥，妻子不得已掏出一分錢來，去買一條油炸檜，貯其半，備晚食，切其半，成小塊，和以醬油，泡以開水，揀飯中之豆，一匙羹，一粒豆，餵着小兒，說，「爸爸過幾天領到了稿費，買半斤油氽黃豆，你和哥哥又可以吃一個禮拜了。」吃罷，殘羹數匙，妻對我說：「爾諒未飽，可再進些，羹若有異味也。」</p>
<p>妻授我飯，和羹而食，油花「檜」屑，確有異芳！終以不忍獨進，剩二匙餽妻，妻不肯，二人嬉戲，目相視，稍久淚各潸然下，餘食不能下咽了！</p>
<p>驚覺，淚霑敗絮，頸疼痛，很自懊悔地想說：「悲何益？徙傷身！」轉輾入睡了。</p>
<p>環境在滬西交通大學，難民是一萬五千餘人，飯因爲新釜未到，煮不成；不得已儘量地收買大餅，五百多個工人，聽我分付，去發大餅給靴胞；一百多位職員，集總辦公廳，在我支配下，分工合作。</p>
<p>吃飯的時候來到，我向大家說；「對不起得很，新釜沒買到，飯煮不成，所長說每人吃一碗麵，發一根油條。」</p>
<p>大家吃麵咬油條，我說麵巳很好吃，油條似乎不必了，我於是留着油條，交工人帶給妻子。</p>
<p>夜深，公畢，返妻室，妻子問我已吾晚食，我說已吃過了，妻子說：「我們大餅已吃過了，方才的油條，我備着你回來吃大餅用，所以留着一半，給你吃呢。油條過夜不好吃，分着吃了吧！」</p>
<p>於是，半根油條，各人一半，因爲飽，不大要吃，妻子又說：「此刻白白地空吃了，想那時黃豆飯沒有菜過的苦惱是够心酸的！」</p>
<p>夢又醒，咬嘴里沒有油條，未得飯者已三日，腹中飢，想油條，更難熬。</p>
<h3>盲者歌</h3>
<p>— 沙龍</p>
<p>誰曾欣賞我五指在絃上撥挑哀怨之音，</p>
<p>更有誰欣賞哀怨之音後賜我同情？</p>
<p>世界就是這末冷酷，</p>
<p>我那里去尋找我底慰藉，</p>
<p>來撫摩我創傷的心靈？</p>
<p>誰又有口能道破我坎坷的平生？</p>
<p>誰又有心能理解我難言的衷情？</p>
<p>似寒鴉棲息深冬的枯枝，</p>
<p>東西南北，我全失去了依憑！</p>
<p>盲者活在人間最不幸，</p>
<p>難道爲了盲，死去不成！</p>
<p>不，我將無休止地撥挑琴之絃，</p>
<p>爲人開不幸的傾訴不平。</p>

<h3>紗花　形勢似疾風暴雨　棉紗橫漲猛落　晨初金融界收進人心鼎沸　此後因浮多了結跌風驟起</h3>
<p>紗市連騰五日、昨則轉呈猛進疾退之狀、開盤漲勢依然猛烈、金融界照市拖進二十支雙馬一百包、巳穿出大關、價爲四百零二元、二十支特金城一轟到四百零八元、此時市塲人心鼎沸、詎料漲風太在、客帮畏縮不前、反動陡起、因一般浮戶獲利者、視漲勢已戢、急來出檔、市盤頓變、跌風驟起、盤盤下降、二十支雙馬做到三百九十一元收　、比開市價跌去十二元之巨、查此種回落亦在意料之中、殊不爲奇、蓋以自紅盤開始以來、二十支雙馬以昨日之頂高價、與上年歲暮市價相較、已經在漲達四十四元、回挫二十元亦不能說多、蓋亦連朝飛漲之結果也、昨日市塲情形、晨初開盤、市氣承上日之餘風、日某銀行又來買進、即見大漲、開價均加七·八元之巨、繼以實需因價高略滯、同時多頭出籠、突然下墜、但收市復、稍形回上、就大勢論之、仍依實際消化爲進退也、查上午成交統計一千零二十五包、同行中佔一半光景、結果售價二十支雙馬價比上日跌三元、雙地球跌一元、特金城乎、天女跌二元、十六支·十支尙稱平平、廠方未有動靜、至出口貨今有三百叫十件、運往汕頭、又五件運香港、茲將各帮買去之額量錄下、</p>

<p>汕頭　一三〇　雲南一一〇</p>
<p>四川　三〇　寗波　五</p>
<p>合計一、〇二五</p>
<p>日紗市塲、開槃受華紗暴騰影響、隨之上漲三四元不等、旋以華紗回挫、亦追踪下降、結果二十支水月現貨價始做三百十七元半、收盤價爲三百十三元、二十支藍鳳現紗價爲三百十四元半、復做三百十元、</p>
<h3>火機花高峯層出不窮　六十七元匯劃行情　外棉交易尙稱熱鬧</h3>
<p>本棉生意、轉趨　寂、細絨棉需要愈形寥落、良以外棉換算價非但不漲、反見疲弱、昨美印棉市依然暗澹無神、日廠辦意甚懈、實以購辦外棉、售價旣廉、額子又可龐大、所以最近幾日、中日各廠購訂外棉之額、與時俱進、三二支細紗原料、成交猶如鳳毛麟角、至於華廠採納外棉心意極不願、無奈處此環境之下、非購買補救、亦</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐的市因華盛頓消息捉摸不定、各業均抱觀望態度、昨又因證券價跌、國外棉商之賣出及多頭了結、價格頗呈疲乏之象、結果美棉又漲十二磅音、印度速同預測無甚軒輊、埃及棉猛跌四十餘磅音、昨日滙兌平平、折合法幣美棉巴西棉及印棉每擔俱跌六七角埃及棉每擔暴跌三元餘本市外棉交易、雖仍熱鬧、然不若前日之盛、昨日火機花售價六十七元、折合現鈔的六十四元、印棉平果兒品質均較火機爲優、將來尙有每擔五角許之水脚回扣可以找還、此種印棉、市上巳有大量做開、合送廠價祗六十一二元耳、故火機及姚花之前途、殊爲黑暗　通州美種之處境、則更爲困難，茲將昨日成交件額及現貨於後、</p>

<h3>金融　中西爭相結外滙　英美匯兌已見回跌　美金較英更為軟化</h3>
<p>滙市昨以美孚油洋行暨紗花帮等爭先扒結、兼銀行賣意淸淡、致局勢稍轉緊縮、唯軋過則美較英允軟、乃英鎊漲率已起回跌所致、港電先扒後塞、沙遜及錢兌業則有賣意、當日尙無特變、成交頗不寂寞</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條及紐約價均不動、倫敦生金又跌二辦士、匯兌英對美小三釐八、對法降二十五生　、對滬平平、美對英縮一分、對法降二五、對滬大一分、中央掛牌各滙呆定如故、銀行早開現貨賣價英滙八辦士四八四三七五、美滙十六元半、較前收英平、美緊〇三一二五、開後因港電扒結、英金八辦士四六八七五、一時引起扒風、銀行均無供力、致　勢步軟、滙豐掛牌及白銀平衡稅揭曉均勿動、此後洋行及英美烟公司結款突湧、兼銀行報價不肯廉賣、故市况益緊、英金八辦士四三七五、美金十六元四〇六二五、午刻成交稀少、僅錢兌業迭拋港匯不已、故爲狀稍平、港匯硬至五十七元一二五、午收英金八辦士四六八七五、美金爲十六元四六八七五、（某行六元半有售意）、</p>
<p>後市初以紗花帮曁洋行等爭先吸收、且銀行賣胃仍淡、致情勢復又步緊、英金八辦士四六八七五、一度難結、軟至爲銀行互做價、後因港電及西商沙遜等賣興驟轉殷濃、並以銀行亦吸胃不佳、而供况漸旺、更因錢兌業又來吐出港滙、於是過程乃形牛定、港滙又曾硬至五十七元一二五、旋即回平至五十七元、晚收銀行賣價英滙八辦士四六八七五、美滙十六元四六八七五、與午收同、結果比前收英緊〇一五六二五美軟〇六二五、茲將一天做開交易錄後、</p>
<h3>客帮大量搜購下　烚赤背純金回漲</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、變動範圍日益狹窄、全天僅有四元差度、惟中途某錢兌業曾代客帮大量神購、幸銀樓帮供意尙佳、致鮮變化、然價終因外滙帶軟、致稍趨堅、交易晨初尙旺、後因多呈觀望態度、遂轉淸淡、</p>
<h3>現金轉漲四元</h3>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開因某錢兌業進意頗濃、故晨開即拾高至一千九百八十八元、乃某錢兌業進金號百兩、此後銀樓帮售意亦强、以致遂告下挫、銀樓帮售予某錢兌業五十兩、價八十六元、（聞大致均代華南客帮）未幾金號吐後忽來復進五十兩、價八十五元、均由銀樓帮供給、其間外滙略軟、因之重復上昇、銀樓帮售予錢兌業五十兩、價八十六元、金號又來復進銀樓帮五十兩、價八十六元五角及錢兌業五十兩、價八十七兀、最後錢兌業售予銀樓帮五十兩、價八十八元、爲午收價、午後外滙呆定逾恒、因之市勢閒散、故做開成交亦寥落無幾、首由金號售予錢兌業五十兩、價八十八元、後銀樓帮售予金號一十兩、價八十九元、此後供求毫無、迨至四時仍無做開、故晚收價仍作一千九百八十九元、較上日軋漲四元、現金號之本脾金售出價一千九百九十五元、收進一千九百八十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、</p>
<h3>飾金回上一元</h3>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出初均未更迨至正午、因烚赤堅穩、故一致掛大一元、大同行老慶雲等懸二百〇二元、新同行縣二百元、收進一百九十四兀、</p>
<h3>純金跌勢漸緩</h3>
<p>九日倫敦電、英純金跌勢已緩、蓋因英滙强後復疲所致、每盎斯續跌二辦士、退達七鎊八先令七辦士半、中央銀行之中國純金（即現金）收買價亦退達一千二百十三元三角、掛牌海關金亦續跌五釐、計二元三角九分六釐、上海標準標金價亦續降一元三角、計一千二百〇八元六角、</p>
<h3>需求仍推日金票</h3>
<p>昨日英純金續跌二辦士、英美滙兌、回降一分、外滙供給未旺、需要稍股、趨勢微弱、烚赤搜購甚殷、散戶出籠尙暢、過程穩定、市勢微俏、外幣略有軒輊、日金票需要旺盛、市價高騰、公會交易稀少、僅勤泰出惠通進美金票二百元、又出鴻昌進美金票五百元、昨日市價、英金鎊降二角、英金票降一分、美金票升二分三厘、香港票升三厘、坎拿大票升二分、斐律濱票升二分、德金票降一角、日金票升二分五厘、朝鮮票升一分、其他各幣、俱未更動、</p>
<h3>貼現再低一角半</h3>
<p>昨滙劃票據貼現率、漸歸穩定、大致徘徊於三十元關口、午收二十八元七角半、下午呆站原價、比前日最後價又低二角半云、</p>
<h3>大條轉平印銀回長</h3>
<p>九日倫敦電、銀市平靜、鮮少變遷、交易有限、收盤後仍極乎穩、大條銀近遠期均無更動、紐的銀電、美銀價依舊有行無市、又孟買銀電、印銀市况挺俏、現貨回長三安那、近期回昇一安那、遠期則猛漲九安那、</p>
<h3>海味　建菇獻新</h3>
<p>首水福建香菇、前日運到二十餘件、身份尙佳隨即開出，其價爲二百十元、後批貨聞不日將續到、</p>
<h3>潮金鈎巿勢復振</h3>
<p>潮汕甲子金鈎、前批到貨、業已銷罄、聞最近到過二十餘件、色澤鮮豔、尙稱適銷、經已售開、其價爲九十五元、比前市漲起十元、據產地消息、本年出數較少、成本加昂、故市勢穩定、</p>
<h3>糖巿　建冰將至</h3>
<p>咋糖市趨勢平穩、公會劃盤二四粗砂白本梭貨二十四元五角無上落、轉口貨小二分半、以十六元二角半劃出、太古車白亦略軟、現貨出嘜爲二十三元九角、國糖潮帮所到新潮靑、因成本較高、不合申銷、或將轉甬出售、上綿赤續有開出、價爲十五元一角半至一角、决之十四元七八角、建帮次白開十八元三角、上白二十二元半、建建冰久無運到、茲據鼓嶼客函詢及價格大的已有出品、不久或將運滬云、</p>
<h3>南北貨　湖蓮續到　喊高十元未成交</h3>
<p>潮蓮前以軋缺、行盤曾達三十元、旋即告斷、昨據行方息、已有轉到一批、因來本較高、而運費加昂、貨主心思未肯即脫、野呌四十元、大的三十五元或可成交云、</p>
<h3>糧食　日商大舉辦常錫米後　六萬包由滸浦出口　滬米來源不勝隱憂</h3>
<p>日來國米來源雖夥、然內地常錫等區近聞日高大事搜求、數達十餘萬包、昨已由人和輪裝運六萬包、從滸浦出口、此種情形，若長此下去恐與滬埠糧食來源、自必發生影響、昨抵埠河下貨祗六七艘、車輪包子萬餘包、銷塲轉懈、本街旣鮮活動、囤戶並且乘勢湧出、故形勢初頗混沌，後則疲軟、結果厚粳小去數分至一角、薄稻亦難立足、跟疲數分、杜洋尖埠尖悉帶軟、變元價盤高昂·囤戶推出、銷塲反呆、價落一角、</p>
<h3>粉銷開展　麥價穩定</h3>
<p>粉昨現粉市仍穩定、惟客銷巳較前微活、北洋帮秦皇島及天津帮散戶零星去化不弱、南洋帮汕間等處進胃亦見生色、統市交易、仍以二號粉爲大宗、三號以下各粉、目下存底寥寥、各廠均鮮供給、故成交亦無形停頓、綜計售開車船牌及天竹漁等粉共四萬包左右、除本街零批的有八九千包外、其餘均由南北兩帮各半辦去、各貨行情、一致穩定、現粉今有二千包運往汕頭、</p>
<p>麥昨市亦轉穩定、查來源方面、新到江北浦鎭及楊州貨數批、惟額數依然有限、究緣蘇北一帶、自蘇省政府禁止出口以來、到貨頗有阻礙、即其他游擊區域、運輸亦感困難、故到貨不易湧旺、貨主售意頗堅、而廠方則嫌價昂、是以進胃銳减、統市僅開六千包之數、由福新阜豐兩廠各半辦去、最高價仍爲六元七角、市面已見平站、現小麥昨有新港來二千六百包、</p>
<h3>客秈回跌洋米平原包存貨仍開十三元</h3>
<p>客秈連日巿價盤砌後、車輪兩路來源均見加增、昨滸浦運來一千二百包、視爲奇貨可居之南京特高秈亦有辦運到滬、市面立轉軟弱、蕪湖秈存底本充、連日絡繹抵埠之浮貨、均求急脫、咋大市貨乃創小四五分至近角云、</p>
<p>洋米</p>

<h3>死</h3>
<p>— 賡</p>
<p>死，最痛苦，也最難得。因此，一般人對於死的觀念，有的是咒咀，有的是讚笑。</p>
<p>死最痛苦，是客觀的，「生人作死別，恨恨那可論，」換句話說：祇有生者纔會感到死的痛苦。死最難得，是主觀的，人人都怕死，而你能够拋棄一切，勇於趨死，便爲難得。所以死有輕於鴻毛，有重如泰山。不當死而死，不必死而死，則輕於鴻毛；當死纔死，必死敢死，則重如泰山。前者的死，因爲死的不得其所，不獨不能換取社會的同情，相反的，因爲他留給一個不良的印象，還嬰遭着社會的唾駡。後者的死，因爲他死得其所，給人家的是一個忠貞節烈的，足爲後死者效法的故事，所以値得歌頌。</p>
<p>在道抗戰的洪流中，死的故事也太多啦！前方的將士，爲了民族，爲了國家，爲了正義，整千整萬的死在戰神之前，他們是中華民國的死士，是正義公理的先導。他們這種壯烈犧牲的偉績，視死如歸的精神，歷史是不會不鄭重記述的；這且按下不說。在淪陷區也多着引頸就義的故事和陳屍街衢的醜聞；這許多的死，非但有輕重之別，而且有順逆之分。</p>
<p>據本報的泰縣通訊：鎭江敎育家會任丹徒縣勸學所所長，鎭江縣敎育局長之徐師竹，鎭江大港鄉人，道德文章，夙爲鄕黨及社會人士所推崇，近因其胞侄徐某在該鄉附逆，力勸脫離不從，認爲奇恥大辱，竟於日前在新洲地方，投江殉國，世之甘心作漢奸者，應當愧死，聞徐某得悉乃叔投江殉國之訊，頗有悔意云。</p>
<p>徐師竹爲了胞侄附逆，勸止無效，而投江殉國，不僅明恥，亦且明志；道種行爲，當然感人至深，彌堪崇敬！然而，他的死，固然有相當的價値，但他以這種死諫的方法企圖換取他那不肖胞侄悔意，是尙有討論的餘地。</p>
<p>漢奸是沒有靈魂的，他們不曉得什麽呌做廉恥，什麽呌做氣節，我們對於這班衣冠禽獸，民族罪人，唯一的辦法便是「殺無赦」，勸阻規諫，是無用的；徐師竹先生旣然有死的勇氣，在「力勸脫離不從」的敎訓下，對於他那不肖胞侄，倘然不能加之以白刃，置之於死地，爲國家除一敗類，爲天地間爭一點正氣，儘可以發動廣泛的除奸運動，促醒一般淪陷區同胞的覺悟，如果因此而招致死的後果，那麽死得更有價値，更爲難得了。</p>
<p>所以，我們認爲：我們要有死的勇氣，同時要有索取死的代價的死志。</p>
<h3>重慶的報紙</h3>
<p>— 管豹</p>
<p>重慶—中國目前的首都，他報紙發行的數量，是遠超在各地之上。就以戰前擁有三百萬人口的上海，所發行的報紙，也不過十大種，但是現在的重慶，到共有十二種之多。</p>
<p>這十二種報紙，大半是從滬寗津漢被迫撤退而去的，因爲戰綫轉移的緣故。</p>
<p>這許多報紙，當然各有旨趣，仕是對於擁護中央政府，贊助蔣委員長的對日抗戰，却是一貫相同的。</p>
<p>中央日報是國民黨的喉舌，也是現在抗戰時期中的唯一導報，自南京淪陷以後，這張報紙就移在長沙出版，去年九月間冉從長沙遷往重慶，於九月十五日第一次發刊；它在長沙，不過留個分館而巳。大公報是最有權威的一張報紙，一向是居列中國四大報紙之一，先在天津，後在上海，現在除了香港出版之外，它又在去年十二月一日在重慶出版了。此外還有漢口移來的掃蕩報和本地出版的西南日報，雖然它們誕生異地，但是可稱爲兄弟報紙，因爲它們和政府中的「黃埔系一都通聲氣：前者對於詳盡的軍事報告是很有名望的，後者都知道是隸屬於委員長總部之下的，對於西南各省的經濟建設，最加注意。當局曾有兩决想把這兩張報紙合併起來，結果沒有成功。</p>
<p>時事新報和新民報也都是撤退的報紙，時事新報原在滬上出版，在去年之初，就移重慶發行，現在背後主持的人是財政部長孔祥熙。新民報是從南京移去的報紙，由國民黨的一位委員所主持的，南京失守，它是最先移往重慶出版。</p>
<p>新華日報是中國共產黨的機關報紙，它載蘇俄通訊機關塔斯社的消息特多，此外對於民衆運動的宏論和通訊也刊載很不少。每天塔斯社的消息總要佔據半頁的篇幅，社評都依據了共產黨的政體立論，由負賣人輪流撰稿。這張報紙最先在去年一月發行於漢口，到武漢撒退之前，剛才搬移到重慶</p>
<p>有人會聯想到重慶的本地報紙或許不能和撤退來的報紙互相競爭罷？這實在是不確的。本地的報紙共有六種：國民公報，新蜀報，濟川公報，西南日報，大江日報，和商務日報。最先的兩種報紙，還是比撤退來的幾種比較普遍化，因爲他們的讀者都是一批對新聞有興趣的民衆，並不是涉有政治關係的人員。</p>
<p>濟川公報是四川省政府的半官報紙，商務日報是本地商會所發行的，大江日報是和省政府的人員有關係的。</p>
<p>重慶各種報紙的銷路，據可靠方面調查，估計如下：</p>
<p>中央日報（五千份）日日新報（六千份）大公報（七千份）新華日報（六千份）國民公報（六千份）新民報（八千份）新蜀報（七千份）掃蕩報（六千份）西南日報（二千份）濟川公報（五百份）商務日報（五百份）大江日報（五百份）</p>
<p>因爲印刷機器的缺乏，所有重慶的報紙，都限制發行一大張，計分四面，大小一律。惟有新民報是例外，因爲它是一種小型的報紙。</p>
<p>這是很希奇的，所有當地各報的編製，都採取英國式，就是第一面並不刊載任何社評或新聞等文字。但是共產黨的新華日報却是例外，它在第一面就刋載兩項評論；新民報却是依據美國式的編製，它的第</p>
<h3>上海的酒吧間</h3>
<p>— 張鎭山</p>
<p>每天，當夜慕展開了以後，那些充滿了濃厚神秘性和刺激性的酒吧間，就在都市裹的幸福羣角逐着夜生活的動態中開始活躍起來。鉅大的霓虹彩色電炬字，在街頭閃爍，在門首炫耀，像少女的媚笑，又像孩童的跳躍，輔佐着玻璃門內揚溢出來的酒香和爵士樂調，給予孤獨路人一種麻痺理智的引誘，使他們投向那醺醉，淫逸，頹廢的園子裹，去給孤獨苦悶的靈魂染上一層在樂的艷色。</p>
<p>在「八一三」之前，「神秘之街」的北四川路和百老滙路，那蓬勃地繫盛過這種酒與女人雙重刺激的消費塲合，然而現在，他們都由陰暗的「地獄」移殖到了快樂的「天堂」，以致霞飛路上，愛多亞路上，朱葆三路上，都加厚了原有的旖旎風光，消褪了從前的蕭條與冷落；每一所屋子裏都坐滿了生活在樂園裹的天之驕子，滿坑滿谷的，像海浪似的波動！爲了換取生命養料而出賣靈魂的女人也嘻開了嘴媚笑，那麽妖冶地安慰一羣羣餓虎似的孤獨者，任他人摟抱，旋舞，戲弄，以帶着苦痛笑樂去陪伴模糊醉態的爛水手，她們的確是間接繁榮酒間的偉人。</p>
<p>所以，每一家酒吧間都具備了樂師與舞女，至少也得僱用幾個如花似玉的女侍，使得那些遠波重洋的異族醉漢，能够得到一點色情的溫存。祗要一面完全是給廣告佔據的。至於就印刷而言，用彩色的僅有新華日報一家。</p>
<p>重慶居民大的有五十萬至七十萬人左右，事實上並不需要這許多報紙。在各種不同的報紙中，重複的新聞報道，徒然是耗費人力和物力。</p>
<p>直到現在，重慶還不見有一張英文版的報紙。這種報紙，實在是很需要的，因爲重慶的外僑已經增加了許多。最近有將漢口的一張外報栘來復刊的傳說，假使這成事實，可使旅渝的外僑，也能讀報而明瞭當前的消息了。</p>
<p>袋內有錢鈔，儘可傲慢地摟住她們把杯同飲，膠着嘴唇甜吻，或者，瘋在地戲狎。</p>
<p>還有一種西人夫妻合開的小酒吧間，也有這種景象出現，丈夫漫酒，老婆就伴客笑舞，在封建氣味尙未完全清除，女子們尙未脫離片面貞操束縛的勢利社會裏，也許有人看了這種狀態要搖頭嘆息，然而他們却像是站在時代的尖端，都有慷慨忍談的風度，雖然是爲了要掙脫生活的練鎖底緊縛。</p>
<p>假使你躊躇於那些酒吧間門前，探首於「Bar　Coffee」。」的霓虹電炬字下，聽着那溫柔的曲調，嗅着那芬郁的酒香，看着女人們的嫵媚浪笑，醉漢們的熱情奔放中，金錢與肉交換的戲狎，以及一切難以寫述的安閑和逸樂的旋動，都會使你不能自由主宰着自己，把握不住理智，而被眼前的現實所陶醉，把一顆純潔的心沉迷在美麗的遐想中，毅然地踏進那種漩渦，去尋求刺激的趣味哩</p>
<p>不過，假使你是一個黃種人，而舉止又欠老練的話，說不定是會得到他們的奚落，因爲她們每天接觸的盡是一些穿大褲管的海上英雄——水兵。那些金元王國的豪客，無生活費些負担的鰥夫，鈔票都是一捲捲的在那裏交換着灑與女人，像播散種子似的，整條的朱葆三路上幾乎盡是他們栽培出來的繁榮！所以，一般老闆，舞特殊的歡迎他們，異樣的親近他們同，服侍他們，奉承他們！如果我們用一句嚴正而頑皮的說法去形容，那麼，他們和她們正是羣製造國際貿易入超的好現象底能手呵！</p>
<h3>十六舖水菓之市</h3>
<p>— 雨山</p>
<p>在法租界黃浦灘路向南閒逛，踱到盡頭的界電車的總站，通南市的耍道，一種擾攘喧譁呌囂煩鬧絡繹擁擠的情形，終日如此。戰後，鐵門關閉，交通斷絕，好似陰陽界隔；向南望過去，只見頹垣殘壁，一片瓦礫，荒凉冷落的景象，眞像死一樣的沉寂，不禁頓興無限的悽悲。</p>
<p>從福建路（不是石路）起向南直到鐵門止，這短短的一段中，一家家都是水菓地貨行，中間夾着幾家鹹魚行。戰前，水菓地貨行都開設在南市東門路和裹馬路一帶，這裏不過有三四家老行。現在，南市的行家，一齊搬到這裹，除沿着電車站一帶外；魚行街的兩旁，是有二十多家搬來的。已成水菓業的中心地點了。</p>
<p>各行家的營業，分專售和兼售兩種：專售者以專營水菓或地貨爲業，兼售者以兼做水菓地貨兩項，更或兼營北貨爲業。現在年關將近，水菓業以廣橘，福橘，汕頭蜜橘，花旗蜜橘，靑果（橄欖），香蕉，甘蔗爲大宗；地貨業以嘐菜，老　，花生，冬笋爲大宗；北貨只限栗子，胡桃，炎子爲大宗。他們都是代客批發，躉宗出售，不做零賣的。是全市水菓地貨業的總發行所。戰前，還向外埠批發，現在已經很少。</p>
<p>每天早上五點鐘起到十點鐘止，是上市的時候；差不多全市的水水菓店的夥計，攤頭的小販，遊　塲裏和碼頭上的小販，都爭先恐後的光來批買。各行家門口，塞滿了人，只見人頭攢動，夥友們手忙脚亂，把一箱箱的橘子，一拖拖的甘蔗，一袋袋的膠菜……在紛擾的呌喊中做着交易；馬路上更有許許多車輛，載着貨物走了的，有停着候客裝貨的，一種熱鬧情形，眞難形容。</p>
<p>魚行，原來也是在這裹生意鼎盛，最最發達。戰前，因魚市塲的創立，這裹的魚行，一概奉令遷移，頓告冷落。戰後，各行叉逐漸在這裹開行，恢復營業，所以每天的早上，各菜塲的魚販，又都來這裹批買，熱鬧情况，和水菓商不相上下，堪稱伯仲。</p>
<h3>雨過天青　第一回　獨臂翁組織自由村　雙胞女禮瞻先烈墓</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>這兩位何小妲的父親，是中國一位國際貿易商人，在新嘉坡各地都有他的產業。他現在帮助政府，經營進出口貿易，在從前稱之爲華僑，但在此刻，却是常常往來於國外國內。因爲現在歐洲美洲與中國的交通，極爲便捷了。這一次，何家兩位小姐，爲什麼來訪問朱愛人呢？原來她們的父親，是中央政府國際貿易委員會的一位重要人物，奉了政府的命令，敎他到首都來。而且他在上海，還有許多公事私事，也得料理一下。兩位小姐聽得父親要到這裏來，她們也想一同來。因爲一則她們自歸國以來，很想到國內幾個通都大邑去游歷一番，可以長些識見。她們原不是靠着職業，方可以餬口的，但是她們的志向，以爲凡爲國民，無論男女，都應該有一個職業。她們回國以後，尙未就事，現在很想先到國內各處去看看，開開眼界，然後選擇一種職樂，那是最好的事。二則呢，她們趁此可以來望望她們的好朋友朱愛人。因爲她們回國以來，雖常通信，通信終不及見面的親暱。朱愛人常常寫信請她們來，她們也常寫信請朱愛人去。但是朱愛人是沒有功夫去的，因爲她翳院裹不能跑開，還是請何家兩位小姐來，所以何家兩位小姐，現在眞個來了。她父親聽說她們要同行，也甚爲高興，這時香港到上海，是每日有兩班飛機開行的，便派人到中國旅行社，向中國航空公司的港滬班定了三個座位，飛到上海來了。在上海勾留了的有一個星期，他們住在上海一座最大的旅館裹。道旅館也有三十餘層，要算上海　房子中最高的了。上海仍舊是個繁華富麗之區，一切主權，雖然都歸中國，可是萬國商人，都麕集在此，還是一個商貨吐納的大口岸，中國是個戰後新興的國家，建設事業，都仰仗歐美各國人士帮忙。有的是關於技術的，有的是關於資本的，他們都願意到東方來。因爲東方的第一個大國的中華民國，是個資源最富，人民最多，而又是蘊蓄最深厚的大寶藏國。（一○）</p>

<h3>藏孫佐臣遺琴紀</h3>
<p>— 蘇少卿</p>
<p>前見本刊載「若其」君「孫佐臣遺琴」及「徐慕雲」君「御騙之實」兩篇文字後，不禁悲感交　焉！絕代琴手孫佐臣氏，既於前年窮困以死，而其二子一女亦相繼夭亡，孫氏之琴法從此絕響，空有遺琴，藏之予手，每於風晨雨夕，撫琴懷人，能不悲予！今述此琴之狀貌及得此琴之經歷，以告天下之知音者。</p>
<p>孫佐臣貌異常人。性亦特怪，晚年流寓上海，頗為潦倒，予稍稍供給之，因每夕相見，彼奏琴，予放歌，如是者半年。一日，予與佐臣同為清客彩唱者操琴，（北站票房在湖社彩唱沈君洪羊洞張君罵曹）佐臣之奏琴也，俟臺上將開唱時，始定弦，音兩捩，音調即準，百不失一，彼成習慣，亦以自豪，他人不能效也。其時　衡引子已畢，佐臣從琴囊中持琴出，大驚失色，乃事前不檢，蛇皮破裂，（俗名跳井，竹馬陷中，再換蛇皮可也。）勢不成音，幸予携佳琴，（友人錢君所贈）急出而授之，予琴在其手，亦異凡品，佐臣因此德予，笑而謂予曰：『君琴固佳，然我之琴，曾隨我五十餘年，目有二大奇遇：一者，光緒帝曾取入內宮，求大太監始得復還，一乾，日本人某欲以千金易之，我不願也。雖然，此琴今日之跳井，如人忽大病失音，即令是大英雄，一時便成無用，吾已七十五歲，老矣，他日必以此琴奉贈。』予固欲得其琴有日矣，聞之甚喜閱三月，佐臣病不能興，予往慰之，佐臣取琴於璧，令予持去。予曰：遲遲，不急，又閱旬餘。佐臣死，葬後十餘日，其子名五者，持一物來，即此琴也。且云：其父遺言，必贈蘇某，於是此琴遂藏吾漏室，佐臣一諾千金，非奇人歟？</p>
<p>此琴竹桿，通長律尺（營造尺八寸一分為律尺一尺）一尺六寸四分，第一竹節距筒面一寸六分，（第一竹節，與筒面距離之長短，有關出音之良否）「聰明孔」長八分，寬二分，比其他胡琴開孔較小，（「聰明孔」者竹桿在筒中之部分，開一長方孔也，此孔之大小長短，關係琴音甚大，增減毫忽，音之好壞　焉。孫佐臣言：彼有羅漢竹佳琴，嫌音猶不亮，彼自行作主，將「聰明孔」放長一分許，琴音暗啞，彼因此不食者數日，不懌者月餘，後尋專家補之，始回響，已不如前。此琴「聰明孔」特小，故其音凝聚而況雄。）筒子長三寸四分，後面圓徑為一寸三分強，前面　皮處圓徑為一寸二分，筒子前小而後大，且前面非正圓，乃橢圓形，皆呈怪特之狀，與餘琴大異。</p>
<p>此琴週身為松香末所積聚，若古銅之青綠斑　，其手澤常動處，則紅紫光潤，又若　砂斑也。</p>
<p>此琴如老驥，遇伯樂執策，則長嘯一聲，能致千里，又如劣馬，省濫竽者玩之，無不蹶　，滾下鞍橋，蓋不惟不響，且令人不能成調，不能成音焉，異哉！吾自視吾技，在伯樂與濫宇者之間，有時心快善，則援琴而鼓，雖不能追踪孫陳（陳彥衡氏）而古調獨彈，亦沾沾自喜，人生貴自適耳，何必求人知耶！</p>
<p>此琴須用剛二弦，粗老弦，又須用盡入木三分之力，始出沉雄渾厚之音，柔弦弱指，反為琴魂所笑。自此琴到吾手，每換蛇皮，必請呂順昌之「小紹興」作之，彼見之必曰「此孫氏之琴也，蓋有識之者矣。或云，此琴這壽，蓋有八十餘年，乃孫氏之師「　三」之遺物也，吾得此琴，豈不自幸耶</p>
<p>嗚呼，西洋大音樂家之遺琴，全世界爭寶之，價值每數萬鎊，今孫氏亦中國不世出之大音樂家也，其遺琴不幸落吾手，孫氏窮困一生，其琴亦不克自現，撫之追者，愴然淚下，吾為此文，使世人知孫氏及其琴之大略，供千載之憑弔焉耳！</p>
<h3>顧無為三訪範雪朋　—范稱又向綠寶辭班—</h3>
<p>— 雄湯</p>
<p>范雪朋從銀幕跳到舞台上，在綠寶　場演話劇，旋因患肺病而輟演，家居休養，綠寶當局，曾經「三顧茅廬」，敦請她照常獻勢，在「約法三章」之下，雪朋於除夕晚上，重行在綠寶登台了，當時協定　三原則是　增加車馬費六十元，　後台特　憇息室，　在病體未完全復原前，得隨時告假或輟演，此事本刊曾有詳細記載。</p>
<p>范雪朋的病，至今還沒有完全痊愈，後台憇息的桌子上，擺滿着盛装藥丸的玻璃瓶玻璃盃。好像離形的醫院一般，日夜兩工　，是很夠累的，扶病登場，終非久計，遂援用三章約法中的一章，向綠寶辭職。而綠寶當局，又因為她登台以後，除添　座位外，依然是場場客滿，那裏肯把這位「女財神」輕易放走，當然是熱烈挽留，並且答應把她所演的一部份戲減輕，衹消她出台演一二場戲就好了，日戲不一定要每天登台，每星期逢三六日登台也可以。但是綠寶劇場的「范派」老看客，正因為她在新劇「眼兒媚」裏的戲很少，都不約而同　寫信要求，在下一本新劇「母親的秘密」裏要多上幾場，弄得綠寶當局，左右為難，而范雪朋的辭意，又是那麼堅決，聽說演到十五日為止了，究竟蟬聯與否，刻下猶在磋商之中。</p>
<p>由范雪朋的堅決辭班，又牽涉到顧無為身上，顧無為這一次從香港到上海，除了為己卯新年打路以外，還有一個新計劃，是綱　海上電影界話劇界人材到香港去演話劇，七八年前，他在上海接辦過齊天舞台（即今共舞台原址）演「啼笑因緣」新劇，人材方面，就是採取的「影劇混合制」，居然很　賣銅鈿，後來開碼頭到南京漢口天津北平，還很掙一筆錢哩。這次他打算把八年前辦法，重仃表演一下，所以帶了她夫人盧翠蘭同來，分頭接洽，成績如何，局外人不得而知，因鑒於「啼笑因緣」裏范雪朋的關秀姑一角很有號召力，前後曾到綠寶後台和慎成里范雪朋的寓所三度接洽，現在顧無為夫婦雖已重返香島，但是和范雪朋的口頭協定，還在「未完」之局哩。看將起來，范雪朋的向綠寶辭班，多少有點關係罷！</p>
<h3>顧傳玠的販馬記</h3>
<p>— 希同</p>
<p>渴望數月的顧傳玠的「販馬記」，終於給我盼望到了。這真是個「實現的夢」！（按此　顧仲　新譯之劇名，有類高爾基「她的情人，」這就是七日晚上光華大學在青年會所舉行的慈善會的表演。</p>
<p>傳玠是仙　社的名小主，他與　傳茗的「販馬記」寫狀全　有　開公司的唱片。傳玠早就息影歌場，改名志成，就讀光華　中，後來升入金陵大學農科畢業。最近聽說在師承中學任教。此次勉應光華同學之邀，破例一唱真是難得的機會</p>
<p>我個人對於販馬記特別感到興趣，說來寒傖　又可笑，原來我生平只在去年學過販馬記寫狀一星期，居然也上台試演，此外別無所能；因未響排，於是在抱哭之時，紗帽翅碰着了桂枝的頭面，鏗然有聲；將寫狀時，近視眼徧覓毛筆不可得，久之，見有一小木棍，粗如糖盧甘蔗，心想也許就是所謂毛筆，便糊塗地提了起來，差幸沒有弄錯，蓋從來未見過如許大之筆也！</p>
<p>看過傳玠的販馬記以後，劉郎不敢再顯糕字，謹將我所見到的「寫狀」　的優點寫在下面：</p>
<p>唱到「對下官，說一個，詳和細」時，拉桂枝袖而起，姿勢甚美，法以兩手手指微提桂枝左袖而搖曳之，步履節奏相和。</p>
<p>聽桂枝允許不哭以後，便笑了起來；接着桂枝哭了，便立刻藏起笑容，口兒張開，作出失望和驚訝的神情，此普通　加上了一句「她又哭起來了」要好得多。感情遽愛，此所謂無言之美歟？</p>
<p>說「我想一個人，得了兩樣病」時，他角必草草而過；傳玠則作思索狀，揣奪情理，低聲而言，然後方說出「這一定是假的」，也細膩得好。</p>
<p>聽桂枝唱到「只得當堂畫招承」，時傳玠連說三四聲「完了，」非常著急，突然發現桂枝跪在地上，連忙扶起；又在說「秋後處決」時，也是三四聲而突然發現桂枝暈倒，連忙去救；都做得很自然，他人只說一聲，不及傳玠之透澈矣。</p>
<p>讀狀至「因姦不從」　而搖頭，「秋後就要——」而手顫，神情逼真。</p>
<p>究竟傳玠是讀書人，書生，演書生，正是本色當行。全般地看來，歌聲柔和，舉止溫文，毫無一點火氣，真是使人佩服！</p>
<h3>崑旦張傳芳之剌虎</h3>
<p>— 范逸鳳</p>
<p>崑劇傳習所子弟張傳芳，習旦背用功，能戲不少，近數數演剌殺旦『費宮人剌虎，』亦有心人也。是劇多少含些刺激性，所以最近仙霓社每貼必客滿，其呌　力殊不尋常。登場傳芳飾費貞娥，衣宮裝——見照片——，『端正好』蘊君　，含國恨……一折，先把滿腹冤　宣洩無遺。直到自承公主，李闖思梁指而忽頭昏腦脹，以之賜腹裝寶一虎，貞娥已有必死之決心，唱『滾繡球』俺切著齒，點綘臀，搵著淚，施脂粉……一折，一字一淚，使觀眾如入真境。過後與一虎交拜天地送入洞房，一虎已　醉，貞娥唱『叨叨令』銀　上……一折，描寫忍辱含垢的痛苦，接下唱『脫布衫』『小菜梁州』兩段『除下了……』已動既不能殺　賊，亦當殺一虎，於是演者脫去宮裝，換上黑褶子，手持鋼匕，唱『快活三』鋼刀上……一折，顯出一副愧煞　眉的豪氣，但是自恐懦怯，再唱『朝天子』恁道　……一折，一步緊一步，場面上已發是極　緊張，最後便掄髪觔斗跌撲種種邊式，連績演出，一面刺虎，一面唱『一任他碎骨粉身，一任他揚灰碾塵，啊呀費貞娥吓，可惜你大才，啊呀！小用了。』這表示沒有荊死闖賊為可惜，而結果自經死。傳芳演來，出色當行，嘆觀止矣。</p>
<h3>故都宮闈秘史（七）（一）</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>落馬湖的地主姓馬</p>
<p>這般坐享祖上餘蔭的子孫們，行為雖比李佩略勝一籌，然而私設公堂，魚肉　民，強姦民女的事兒，直到民國以來，還是未嘗　改。徐州人一提到馬家圩子，依然拿牠當作「溪皇荘」一樣的看待，他們圩子裏　窩藏着許多竿子頭兒（竿子頭即土匪頭）自己養着一般唱戲的，就呌做馬家班子，那種作福作威的樣子，着實使人側目。不想十五年北伐，將軍閥的勢力打倒，同時又打倒士豪劣紳，遂經黨　工作人員把他們一切的罪案，檢舉到首都持別法庭裏，這才把他們逮捕到南京，押了一年有餘，後來　着特赦，才放了出來。雖是稍為　迹，　而那種惡霸士豪的性子，仍舊不曾改掉，現在聽說又去當了漢奸，借着敵人的勢力，欺壓邳宿兩縣的鄉民，所以清初時猴兒　佩的餘毒，依然存在落馬湖的地主馬姓族人們裏。</p>
<p>車皋公擅換容術</p>
<p>皮黃劇裏以「昭　」的唱工最為繁　，因為不但是一個人的獨腳戲，沒大有休息的工夫，並且胡琴忽高忽低，時而西皮，時而二黃，連唱數段二黃之後，再唱西皮二六及搖板，來回個的　倒蹬，（倒蹬　翻來覆去意）要是嗓子差一些的，唱到後來就得開豁。況且二黃裏從無快板之說，獨然這　戲裏，三更五更後的「心中有事難合眼」一雞鳴犬吠五更天一兩段抉一眼二黃，共有二十多句，皆須一氣呵成，雖名為一眼二黃，（即原板）實則毫無下鼓楗子的地方。唱時只有用板　着尺寸，半點透氣的空隙全都沒有。有時候三個字全唱在一板上，倘若遇着一位大舌頭，或者口齒不甚清楚的角兒，那準得像吃拔絲山藥燙了舌頭一樣，浄打嘟嚕啦。</p>
<p>張傳芳戲裝</p>
<p>來函　逕啟者，關於「藝華放棄金素琴」事，（中略）當時電影界知者甚多。鄙人投稿貴刊，自問絕無他意，深恐發生悮會，特此鄭重聲明，匆布即上　編輯先生　辛士謹啟</p>

<h3>Chinese Army in Western Shanxi Counterattacks with Irresistible Force; Recovered Pujin, Daning, and Xiangning; Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Convened a Military Conference in Northern Shaanxi; Discussing Major Plans with Southwest Leaders for Two Days</h3>
<p>(Xi'an) Military News: A unit of the Chinese army under Commander Du, on the evening of the 8th, charged into Jixian city, engaging in fierce street fighting with the Japanese army. Subsequently, another unit of the Chinese army occupied all the nearby hilltops. The Japanese army, unable to withstand the attack, fled in disarray towards Xiangning overnight. The Chinese army then recovered Jixian county and has dispatched additional troops to pursue the enemy towards Xiangning. Also, the Japanese army in Daning, after being fiercely attacked by a certain unit of the Chinese army, completely fled on the afternoon of the 7th. The Chinese army recovered the county on the same day. (Dispatch of the 10th)</p>
<p>Heyang: According to a telephone call from the front lines, the Chinese army in western Shanxi has been counterattacking the Japanese army for days, advancing with irresistible force and winning every battle. Following the recovery of Jixian and Da Ning, the counties of Puxian and Xiangning have also been successively recovered. The remaining Japanese troops are fleeing backwards, and the Chinese army is currently pursuing them in victory. (Dispatch of the 10th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Chairman Chiang Kai-shek continued to hold meetings with southwest leaders yesterday and today. Economic matters remained the main focus. The chairman of Sichuan Province will visit Kong Xiangxi, the president of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, tomorrow to report on the political and financial situation. (Dispatch of the 10th from Huitong News Agency)</p>

(Special Dispatch of the 10th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) A spokesperson for the Chinese army recently declared to reporters that the Chongqing headquarters originally planned to move to Chengdu. However, due to the need for convenient communication with the Military Affairs Commission in Chongqing, this plan has been abandoned. Zhang Qun, the director of the headquarters, will be transferred to another position. General Bai Chongxi has been appointed as the commander-in-chief of the Southwest Theater headquarters, and General Cheng Qian has been appointed as the commander-in-chief of the Northwest Theater headquarters.

<h3>Chinese Army Once Charged into Shilong City</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to military news from Guangdong Province, after the Chinese army in eastern Guangdong recovered Zengcheng, it advanced in two directions: one attacking Shitan, and the other attacking Shilong on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway. The Japanese army, due to its weak forces, was unable to hold its ground and retreated towards Guangzhou. It is widely expected that the Chinese army will soon recover both locations. The unit of the Chinese army under Zhang Ruigui once charged into Shilong on the evening of the 8th of this month, engaging in fierce street fighting with the Japanese army and killing many Japanese soldiers. However, after Japanese reinforcements arrived, the Chinese army withdrew from the city. (Express News Agency Dispatch of the 10th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Currently, the fighting in Guangdong Province is most intense in the Xijiang area. The Japanese army near Sanshui launched a fierce attack westward in two directions under the cover of heavy artillery fire: one attacking Jinli, and the other attacking Houli in the northeast of Zhaoqing. The Japanese army attacking Jinli was met with fierce resistance from the Chinese defending forces and local militias, suffering heavy casualties and retreating in disarray. In the Houli area, fierce fighting is still ongoing. Shilong and Dongguan in eastern Guangdong are currently under siege by the Chinese army. It is reported that a unit of Zhang Fakui's troops, recently moving south from northern Guangdong, has arrived near Shilong and is currently attacking Shilong in conjunction with other friendly forces. More than 700 soldiers of the Japanese army under Hasegawa arrived in Shilong yesterday as reinforcements. (Express News Agency Dispatch of the 10th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Reports regarding the situation in South China are inconsistent here, and some are contradictory. Some claim that the Chinese army has indeed recovered Zengcheng and Shilong, while others say that the Chinese army did attack the above-mentioned two cities but later withdrew. Official statements have not clarified which is true. According to reports, the Japanese army near Hekou attempted to cross the Xijiang River in a surprise attack but was repelled by the Chinese army. Subsequently, 30 Japanese aircraft came out to wreak havoc, bombing Chinese army positions and causing heavy losses. (Dispatch of the 10th from Huitong News Agency)</p>

<p>Zhanggongdu: A certain unit of the Chinese guerrillas destroyed roadbeds in five locations and burned five bridges along the Wangjiashan area of the Ruiwu Road on the 9th, cutting off more than a hundred electric poles. Another guerrilla unit attacked the Japanese army in Xiaoao. The Japanese army was gathering at the time, and the Chinese army took advantage of their unpreparedness, hiding in the mountain hollows and opening fire with machine guns and throwing hand grenades. The Japanese army suffered extremely heavy casualties. Just as they were about to descend the mountain to annihilate the enemy, more than 300 Japanese reinforcements suddenly arrived from Henggang and shelled the Chinese army. The Chinese army, realizing that its objective of a surprise attack had been achieved, quickly transferred. In this battle, more than 100 Japanese soldiers were killed, but due to the rapid movement, the number of captured items was relatively small. (Dispatch of the 10th)</p>

<h3>Guerrilla Forces in North China Are As Active As Ever</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) News from Tianjin: Recent Japanese propaganda claims that there are no traces of guerrilla forces within thirty miles of the railways in North China, which is a complete deception of the world.

<h3>No Changes in the Battle Situation on the Border Between Hunan and Hubei</h3>
<p>Pingjiang: The battle situation in the Hunan-Hubei border area is calm and unchanged. The Japanese army, fearing attacks from the Chinese guerrilla forces, has been patrolling the circular road from Wulipai in Yueyang to Taolin with several tanks every day in order to create a false impression. Currently, the Yamazaki, Ota, and Nakamura units, totaling more than a thousand soldiers, are stationed in Taolin and its southwest Tuoba Wujiang area. The Nishimura Regiment's infantry, cavalry, and artillery, totaling two thousand soldiers, are stationed in Yueyang and its suburbs. (Dispatch of the 9th)</p>

<p>Changsha: The battle situation in northern Hunan remains largely unchanged. The Chinese army is still facing off against the Japanese army along a line starting from the shore of Dongting Lake in the west, passing through the north bank of the Xinqiang River, and extending to the Jiuling Mountains. According to news received here from foreign sources in Hankou, one division of the 3rd Division of the Japanese army, which was originally stationed in Wuhan, began to move south on the 7th of this month, apparently to reinforce the Yueyang area. According to general observation, the Japanese army may soon use all its strength to invade south along the Yuehan Railway from Yueyang. On the Xiang-E Highway, due to the overlapping peaks and ridges of the Jiuling Mountains and the dangerous terrain, they will take a feint attack to contain the Chinese army's forces. A large amount of the track on the northern section of the Yuehan Railway was destroyed when the Chinese army withdrew to the south. The two bridges in Puqi and Nanjingang were even thoroughly destroyed by the Chinese army, which is a huge project and difficult to repair in the short term. Therefore, there has been no direct traffic between Wuchang and Yueyang. At present, Chinese guerrilla forces are still active behind the Japanese army, preventing the Japanese army from rushing to invade south. A certain mobile unit of the Chinese army once charged into Linxiang Station on the evening of the 8th of this month, fighting fiercely with the Japanese army until dawn the next day before withdrawing. In this battle, the Japanese army suffered at least 300 casualties, while the Chinese army only lost one company commander and 37 soldiers. (Express News Agency Dispatch of the 10th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Rumor: Wang Jingwei Leaves Hanoi, Fears Assassination and Escapes in Disguise; Accompanied by a Servant, His Whereabouts Are Unknown</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to Japanese reports, Wang Jingwei lived near Hanoi and suddenly disappeared last night. It is said that Wang was afraid of being assassinated and disguised himself as a small merchant, escaping together with two confidante servants in disguise. His whereabouts are unknown. (Dispatch of the 10th from Huitong News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today, the newspapers here criticized Wang Jingwei's open letter to Chongqing, agreeing to pay attention to the opportunity for a ceasefire mentioned in the letter, because the aid from Britain, the United States, and France is now gradually being realized, but it can only benefit China's negotiations and is not enough to affect the results of the war, so that we can achieve the final victory by military means. The newspapers all advocated adopting a wait-and-see policy. The National News said that what kind of real influence Wang Jingwei's letter has, it will only be seen after two months. As for the peace conditions proposed by Wang, Japan cannot accept them as the basis for negotiations. With regard to respecting China's sovereignty and territory, and concluding a public economic cooperation agreement to prevent communism, an agreement can be reached, but it is absolutely impossible for the entire Japanese army to withdraw from China quickly. Japanese soldiers in China are unwilling to leave the mainland until true peace and order have been established. (Dispatch of the 10th from Reuters)</p>

<h3>Chamberlain's Policy of Appeasement</h3>
<p>British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax set off together yesterday, leaving England and passing through Paris, the French capital, for a short stay to talk with French Prime Minister Daladier, and then went quickly to Rome, the Italian capital, to have a good meeting with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. This trip is Chamberlain's planned follow-up after twice flying to Germany last year to personally negotiate with German leader Hitler and conclude the Munich Agreement. His greatest wish is to mediate between the four countries of England, France, Germany, and Italy to appease the overall situation in Europe; he will do his best to travel and toil for all the problems that hinder appeasement, seeking ways to overcome difficulties and resolve disputes; the old man's great undertaking is commendable.</p>
<p>When you have exhausted the mountains and rivers and suspect there is no road, the shade of willows and the brilliance of flowers reveal another village; what a joyful realm this is, we sincerely wish Chamberlain success in entering this ideal state. However, judging from the current situation, the overall situation in Europe is becoming more and more chaotic like trying to sort silk; one may suspect that there is no way to appease it. When Chamberlain scheduled his visit to Italy, Czechoslovakia had just ascended the altar of peace and made a sacred sacrifice, the flames of war were extinguished, and the situation suddenly eased; Chamberlain believed that the shock had just subsided, and after catching his breath for a while, all that was needed was to seize the opportunity to mediate the contradictions. With the great disaster over, dawn could be expected. However, in the past two or three months, although Britain feigned deafness to the Spanish affair, acknowledging the validity of the Anglo-Italian Agreement to show favor to Italy; although France dispelled old hatred with Germany, issuing a joint Franco-German declaration to show trust in Germany; the problems of Poland, Hungary, and Ukraine that followed Czechoslovakia's sacrifice became increasingly acute; Germany has always expressed its unwillingness to give up the issue of colonies; and Italy has openly coveted French territories in Africa; France has resolutely stated that it will never cede an inch of territory, and declined Chamberlain's mediation of the Franco-Italian territorial issue. In addition, new disputes and old cases are too numerous to mention, and what corresponds to the various international disputes that arise is that each country exhausts its resources to create an unprecedentedly large military budget. Swords are drawn and bows are strung, ready to be fired, it seems that either there will be a great sacrifice, or there will be a tragic war; the situation when Chamberlain scheduled his visit to Italy was not as obviously becoming more difficult as it is today.</p>
<p>International visits do not allow one to go back on one's word; since the plan was made two months ago, Chamberlain must go. We have no way of knowing the mood of Chamberlain on his journey; is he aware of the exhausted mountains and rivers and just trying his best? Or is he relaxed amidst the shade of willows and the brilliance of flowers, and holding the pearl of wisdom? Will he make them aware of the advantages and disadvantages of international competition to expand armaments, showing them the determination of Britain and France not to make any more concessions, hoping that the other party will change their minds and abandon their intention of seizing and plundering? Or does he have another sacred sacrifice like Czechoslovakia in his luggage, to temporarily satisfy Italy's so-called reasonable and legitimate desires? All of these things cannot be known.</p>
<p>World peace is indivisible, and Chamberlain's European appeasement policy is also indivisible; therefore, Chamberlain's policy will only be effective and have supreme value on the day when the entire situation is clearly understood; otherwise, it may be harmonious in Berlin and Paris but frustrated in Rome, or harmonious in Paris and Rome but stumbling in Berlin, or England, France, Germany, and Italy may each get what they want, but clash with other countries, then any spark can still start a prairie fire, and ultimately lead to complete failure. Because of this, the success or failure of Chamberlain's trip will have a serious impact on the entire world, and it is inevitable that all parts of the world will pray that this gentleman's trip will be unexpectedly successful. If unfortunately it does not meet the expectations of the world, then not only will this trip be in vain, not only will Chamberlain's policy fail, but it can also prove that there is no hope for appeasing the European situation through the four-country route. What follows the hopelessness of the four-country appeasement route will be a fundamental change in the European appeasement policy; that is, no longer applying the diplomacy of seeking complete security through compromise and living in a state of temporary peace, but waiting for facts to prove whether today's arrogance is a bluff, or whether today's drawn swords and strung bows are indeed the eve of a reversal of human civilization and a fight to the death? We deeply hope that Chamberlain's trip will not be in vain, and we fundamentally doubt that compromise is not enough to seek complete security, that the four countries are not enough to appease the European situation, and that merely appeasing the European situation is not enough to protect human civilization; the scope of appeasement must be expanded into a large circle, at least outside the four countries of England, France, Germany, and Italy, uniting with the United States in the west, uniting with Soviet Russia in the north, and paying attention to China in the east, and then there can be hope for long-term peace and stability!</p>
<h3>Britain and the United States Decide to Take Further Action to Provide Economic Aid to China; Maintaining the Chinese Currency Will Benefit Commerce in China; American Congressman Advocates Cutting Off Trade Relations with Japan</h3>
<p>(London) Reuters diplomatic correspondent learns that London cabinet members have been discussing the Japanese attitude toward closing the door to China for a long time, and the British and American governments have exchanged views in considerable detail. According to observers, the United Kingdom and the United States have each reached the same decision based on the same facts, so some similar actions can be expected to be taken. Although the claim of helping the Chinese currency has not been confirmed, it is undeniable that maintaining the Chinese currency does benefit foreign businessmen in China. Therefore, people here are deeply dissatisfied with the actions of the government under the wings of the Japanese to issue counterfeit money and disrupt the national currency.

<h3>Diplomatic and Domestic Difficulties Are Numerous; Japan Is Beset with Crises; The Economy Is Exhausted and the People Are Resentful; It Is Feared That Hiranuma Will Also Be Powerless</h3>
<p>Moscow According to Soviet public opinion, the main reason for the cabinet shake-up in Japan this time is the failure of the Konoe Cabinet's policy toward China. The prolongation of the war in China has led Japan to be isolated internationally and to have a disconnected economy domestically. In particular, the finances are on the verge of collapse, and anti-war sentiment in Japan has been growing. Serious divisions have also occurred within its ruling class. The main factor causing this situation is the continued mobilization of military spending. The formal expenditure of Japan's national budget for 1939-40 is 3.69 billion yen, while the special expenses for the war against China requested by the army and navy amount to 6 billion, which is an even larger amount. Where will this huge expenditure come from? This has now become a very serious problem. Tax revenue cannot meet the needs of the warlords. In recent years, Japanese consumption has plummeted, and most industrial sectors have greatly reduced production due to a lack of raw materials, so all national tax revenues cannot be collected as expected. Issuing national debt is also becoming increasingly difficult, because large financial capitalists are unwilling to sacrifice profits. At the same time, the industrial and commercial sectors have suffered huge losses due to being controlled by the government in accordance with the National General Mobilization Law, and they are also resentful. Thus, on the one hand, they are forced by the demands of the warlords, and on the other hand, they are opposed by the financial groups. Konoe had no choice but to leave. The current Hiranuma cabinet will naturally continue the war against China, expand general aggression in East Asia and the Pacific, further fascistize the country, and at the same time tighten the suppression of the domestic anti-war movement. However, all the unsolvable problems that caused the collapse of the Konoe cabinet still exist. Hiranuma is not a superhuman, so he is powerless to deal with them. (Dispatch of the 9th from TASS)</p>

After completing his official duties in the city, he went to Hong Kong. At that time, the war in South China broke out, and he was ordered to stay temporarily to take charge of refugee relief. He went to Macau, Zhongshan, Shenzhen, Shatoujiao, and other places to personally offer condolences and inspections, announced the Central government's kindness, and urged progress. Overseas Chinese in various places were extremely enthusiastic in their support, and the Hong Kong government and international figures showed sympathy and cooperation, which is greatly appreciated. Now that the deployment is roughly set, he is flying to Chongqing to report to Chairman Lin and the central authorities and to request instructions. He stated that our highest leader's speech refuting Konoe's statement deeply inspired Chinese and foreigners in Hong Kong, and he deeply believes that our country will continue to persevere and fight to achieve the goal of resisting aggression.

<h3>The Soviet Union Rushes to Build Highways to Xinjiang's Huiyuan</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The ancient "Silk Road" was the necessary route for trade between India, Persia, and China. At that time, camel caravans traveled from Tashkent, Samarkand, and Bukhara (all in Uzbekistan, Soviet Union) to Kulja (now Huiyuan in Xinjiang Province). It was abandoned after the Soviet revolution in 1917. Now, to facilitate transportation, it has been decided to repair it. Construction of the highway within the Soviet Union began in early 1937. The section from Almaty (formerly Verny) to Bissega has been completed and will be extended to Malvono village (75 kilometers from Almaty) within this year. (Havas, Tokyo, 10th)</p>

He arrived in Rangoon on December 29th, taking 17 days and traveling a total of 2,100 miles. There were no serious delays or tire punctures along the way. This was the first private car to travel the new highway. Johnson told visiting reporters that the entire highway was surveyed and built by local workers, without using any road construction machinery. (Reuters, Tokyo, 10th)</p>

<h3>The Flames of Autocratic Nations Are Raging; British Prime Minister Sets Off for Rome; Reveals that France and Britain Will Hold Talks in Paris First; The Key to European Security Hinges on Italy's Attitude</h3>
<p>(London) Many British cabinet members gathered at the Prime Minister's residence on Downing Street to send off Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax. In the hour before the Prime Minister left his residence, calls came from many places to wish him success in his trip to Rome. Chamberlain, carrying his world-famous umbrella in his left hand, walked to the corridor. His wife came out to say goodbye. As the Prime Minister's car passed the government offices, the crowd cheered three times and shouted, "Good luck!" Several hundred people gathered at Victoria Station to watch the Prime Minister and others depart. Before departing, the Prime Minister did not make any statements. As the crowd waved their handkerchiefs to see him off, some unemployed people carried a black empty coffin to the station, with the words "Comfort the unemployed, but not Mussolini" written on the coffin. These protesters wanted to carry the coffin onto the platform, but they were stopped by the police. (Reuters, London, 10th)</p>
<p>(London) British Prime Minister Chamberlain has left England for Rome to visit Mussolini. Chamberlain's policy of trying to ease the flames of the dictators and resolve the European crisis has now entered a critical stage. Chamberlain's decision to go to Italy is his fourth visit to a dictatorial country in the last three days. If Mussolini insists on continuing to interfere in the Spanish Civil War and implementing the Anglo-Italian Agreement, Chamberlain's policy towards the dictatorial countries will inevitably become stronger. Since the Munich Conference, Chamberlain has gradually lost his patience because the dictators have shown no reward for his policy of appeasement. Chamberlain has made it clear in public speeches that it is now time for dictators to contribute to peace. Observers are convinced that if Hitler and Mussolini still show no intention of peace, Chamberlain may be forced to abandon the policy of appeasement. Therefore, Chamberlain's meeting with Mussolini is the focus of the European diplomatic situation. (Associated Press, London, 10th)</p>
<p>(Paris) British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax passed through here on their way to Rome. This afternoon, they will hold symbolic talks with Prime Minister Daladier and Foreign Minister Bonnet to show that both sides have a consistent attitude towards Italy. In other words, France will not make any concessions to the territorial demands that Italy may make. After the British cabinet members arrive in Rome, they can notify Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. This is what the British cabinet members can "mediate," but they must not take a step further and come forward to mediate. As for the Spanish issue, France will still adhere to the resolutions passed by the Non-Intervention Committee on the Spanish Civil War. It will only recognize the Nationalists as a belligerent group after all foreign volunteers have been withdrawn. All of this is well known to London. Especially since Prime Minister Daladier's tour of Corsica and Tunisia has been warmly welcomed, it is necessary to reaffirm the good understanding between Britain and France before the authorities of Britain and Italy begin talks. These talks, in practical terms, are a contact between the axis of totalitarianism and the axis of democracy. If Italy provokes a war for the demands it has made, Germany will certainly assist it when necessary, and the understanding between Britain and France must be used to deal with it. (Havas, London, 10th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Responsible sources here recently announced that the British government has formally notified Italy that if Italian Prime Minister Mussolini involves the dispute between France and Italy during the talks between the British and American cabinet members in the coming days, Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax will refuse to act as mediators and will advise the Italian Prime Minister to directly launch an initiative towards France in order to restore normal relations. It is understood that after exchanging views through diplomatic channels, the governments of Britain and France have reached a complete consensus. Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax will reiterate this when they come to Paris for a Foreign Ministry tea party tomorrow. In short, the British government has fully endorsed France's views on Italy's various demands. The main points of this view are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Foreign Minister Bonnet stated to the Chamber of Deputies on December 19th of last year that France would never cede an inch of land to Italy. Later, when Prime Minister Daladier toured North African territories, he gave a speech stating, "We cannot tolerate any destruction of France's territorial integrity, whether by direct or indirect means." (2) The French port of Djibouti in East Africa is a major base for France's shipping lanes to the Far East. Any demand involving the territorial sovereignty of the port will be refused consideration. (3) France is prepared to cooperate with Italy in the operation of the railway line from Djibouti to the capital of Abyssinia. France previously transferred 20 percent, or 2,500 shares, of the railway's stock to the Italian government to demonstrate a spirit of compromise. (4) Regarding the management of the Suez Canal, France holds as many as 800,000 shares of the canal's stock, giving it a dominant position on the canal's board of directors. (The canal's board of directors is currently composed of 19 French directors, 10 British directors, 2 Egyptian directors, and 1 Dutch director.) Furthermore, the concession for the canal will expire in 1968, at which time the Egyptian government will take it back and manage it independently. Italy's request to participate in the canal's management is actually related to Egypt's own interests. (5) Tunisia belongs to France, which was freely decided by the unanimous decision of the local residents. Prime Minister Daladier's tour of North Africa demonstrated that the local residents unanimously expressed their loyalty to France. (6) The Franco-Italian Agreement of 1935, although unilaterally declared invalid by Italy, is still considered valid by France. (7) According to this agreement, France and Italy should continue negotiations to agree on various annexes to resolve various outstanding issues between the two countries. The former French chargé d'affaires in Italy, B longtai'er, began negotiations with the Italian authorities in early last year, but they were interrupted shortly thereafter. France is now prepared to reopen negotiations with Italy in accordance with this agreement. (Havas, London, 9th)</p>
<h3>The Anglo-Italian Talks in Rome Are of an Exploratory Nature; The Spanish Issue and Franco-Italian Disputes Will Be the Main Topics of Discussion Between the Two Countries' Authorities</h3>
<p>(London) A Reuters diplomatic correspondent said that the gist of the Rome talks is more exploratory than negotiation. The British Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary's visit to Rome is without preconceived notions, a formal agenda, or any indication from the Italian side as to what Mussolini wants to discuss. It is generally speculated that the talks will involve the Spanish War and Franco-Italian relations. Regarding Franco-Italian relations, London and Paris now have a clear understanding that there will be no British mediation, as this is purely a matter for the French and Italian governments to resolve. Although the improvement of the atmosphere between France and Italy is welcomed by Britain, it is not something that Britain can interfere with. The French government has recently stated in a very clear manner that it does not want British mediation. It is heard that Britain and France have a complete understanding on this matter. As for the situation in Spain, the British and others will explain that Britain attaches great importance to the fulfillment of Italy's promise to respect Spain's integrity. The issue of granting belligerent rights to the Spanish combatants cannot arise until the plan for the withdrawal of foreign volunteers proposed by the Non-Intervention Committee has been fully implemented. In addition to the above two matters, the refugee and economic issues may also be discussed, but the general trend will depend on what issues Mussolini wants to raise. It is hoped that the British and others will not bring back a fixed solution, as this is not the original intention of the British Prime Minister's trip, but to personally find out the trend of Italy's axis policy in the coming months. (Reuters, London, 10th)</p>
<p>(Rome) On the eve of the visit of British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax to Italy, experienced observers here stated that when Prime Minister Mussolini holds talks with Prime Minister Chamberlain, he should raise various demands regarding African issues, both legally and economically. In terms of territory, he should only demand the annexation of French Somaliland in East Africa, including the port of Djibouti, without involving Tunisia or Corsica, so that the status quo of the Mediterranean territory guaranteed by the Anglo-Italian Agreement can be maintained. He should also cite the "spirit of the Munich Agreement" and emphasize that Italy's various demands are "fair and just" and must be met before the Mediterranean can restore a stable situation. In addition, he should urge Prime Minister Chamberlain to mediate between France and Italy, link Italy's various demands on France with the Spanish issue, and make the recognition of the Spanish Nationalist Army as a belligerent group a condition for the withdrawal of Italian volunteers. As for other issues purely between Britain and Italy, such as the border demarcation between the British and Italian territories in East Africa and Anglo-Italian trade issues, they should also be raised for discussion at this opportunity. Some even predict that as a result of the talks, Britain and Italy may conclude a trade agreement. (Havas, London, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) Well-informed sources in political circles here recently stated that during the talks between the British and Italian cabinet members in the coming days, the issue of the Spanish Civil War being mediated by the signatory countries of the Munich Agreement, namely Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, may be raised for discussion. The cessation of the Spanish Civil War is one of the prerequisites for appeasing the European situation, and it is to be expected that the British and Italian authorities will take this as the theme of the talks. In addition, both sides of the Spanish Civil War want to occupy a strong position before the talks begin, as can be seen from the Nationalists' offensive on the Catalonia front and the government forces' offensive on the Extremadura front in the west. It is rumored that both sides of the Spanish Civil War will send informal observers to Rome to monitor the progress of the talks. The Nationalist government is said to be sending the Duke of Alba, its representative in Britain, while it is not yet known who the Republican government intends to send. Prime Minister Mussolini may express to Prime Minister Chamberlain his willingness to withdraw Italian volunteers in exchange for gains in other areas. If so, then the primary condition put forward by Spanish Republican Prime Minister Negrín regarding the mediation of the civil war by a third country, namely the complete withdrawal of foreign volunteers, can be met. Although the attitude of the Nationalist government is unknown, it can be asserted that if mediation is to become a reality, it must be jointly carried out by Britain, France, Germany, and Italy.

<h3>Germany's Eastern Advance Meets Resistance: Germany Uses Colonies as Bait to Divert Poland's Attention</h3>
<p>(Paris) Diplomatic circles originally thought that Germany intended to resolve the Central European issue first and was unwilling to immediately and practically support Italy's "wave of anger." However, because its efforts to expand its influence to Hungary, Romania, Poland, and even Czechoslovakia have encountered difficulties, its large-scale "Eastern Advance" movement has slowed down as a result, and there is a possibility of changing its attitude. Thus, the colonial issue has once again become a current issue. Italy's "skirmishes" against France have also become an issue of common interest for Germany and Italy. German leader Hitler, in his talks with Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck yesterday, used the acquisition of compensation for the colonial issue as bait, hoping to divert Poland's attention from the Ukrainian issue. It is directly beneficial for Germany to raise the colonial issue to alleviate the resistance it encounters in Eastern Europe. Italy's demands can be used to test the extent of future resistance, so why not take advantage of it? Conversely, it is no coincidence that Mussolini urged the meeting between Hitler and Colonel Beck, as Mussolini probably intended to link the colonial issue with Italy's territorial desires in the Mediterranean. (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) After Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck recently came to Berchtesgaden, Germany, and held talks with German leader Hitler, well-informed sources in political circles here have confirmed that the talks focused primarily on the Mediterranean issue. Hitler reportedly reassured Foreign Minister Beck regarding the Ukrainian issue, urging him not to worry and emphasizing that Germany and Poland have common interests on the colonial issue. (Havas dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Warsaw) Official circles have recently issued a statement saying that after Foreign Minister Beck's recent talks with German leader Hitler, it is now known that external reports regarding Germany's intentions towards Eastern Europe are "exaggerated." The non-aggression pact signed between Germany and Poland in 1934 has not been weakened and has been confirmed by these talks. Observers here have commented that Hitler's guarantee to Foreign Minister Beck regarding the Ukrainian issue is evident in the official statement. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>Southern Offensive: Government Forces Win Major Victory, Occupying 700 Li in Four Days; Rebels Reinforce from Morocco</h3>
<p>Spain: Government forces on the Estremadura front in southern Spain have launched an offensive for five days. After adopting a strategic encirclement of the Benalúa mining area, the Nationalist forces have withdrawn from the south of the area and are resisting in the Montemolín area. Yesterday evening, government forces attacked Nationalist positions in the Doloso Mountains, inflicting heavy casualties. The fighting continued until 10 p.m. last night. Nationalist planes strafed government reinforcements arriving by train. In total, government forces have occupied 700 kilometers in the past four days since launching their offensive on this front. (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Barcelona: According to Spanish government sources, the left wing of the government forces on the Estremadura front has occupied Azuaga, which is ten miles from the highway between Seville and Burgos, and is advancing towards Villalba de los Barros and Llerena. At the same time, the right wing has occupied Mount Rubialos and the road to Castuera. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Gibraltar: According to news received here, Spanish Nationalist forces and militias have hastily withdrawn from La Línea, Algeciras, and Tarifa to Seville in order to reinforce the Estremadura front. As for the Nationalist reinforcements being transferred from Morocco to the mainland, this has not yet been confirmed. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Barcelona: It has been two weeks since the Nationalist forces launched their offensive on the Catalonia front. Their only significant achievement has been the occupation of Borjas Blancas and Alzas Secas, which control key transportation routes and are crucial to the government forces' northern defenses. From a military strategy point of view, this is very important. However, the Nationalist forces were supposed to occupy these places within the first week of the offensive, but they only captured them in the second week. As a result, the government forces were able to deploy calmly in the rear, and the strategic value of the fall of these places was reduced. Government officials also said that the victories achieved by the Nationalist forces in the past week were not decisive. Although they made progress on the front, the heavy losses in personnel and ammunition offset the gains. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3>France Decides to Strengthen Naval Shipbuilding to Protect Mediterranean Trade and Maintain Advantage over Germany and Italy</h3>
<p>(Paris) Naval Minister Campinchi recently gave a speech to a right-wing hardline newspaper, stating that France must step up the construction of warships in order to maintain its current advantage over Germany and Italy. France currently has a total tonnage of 500,000 tons, Italy has 450,000 tons, and Germany has 170,000 tons. In terms of tonnage under construction, France has 120,000 tons, Italy has 150,000 tons, and Germany has 250,000 tons. If France does not intensify its efforts, it will no longer have an advantage in the Mediterranean by 1944. The enemy could seize France's North African territories with a single move, and at that time, no matter how strong France's land and air forces were, they would be unable to stop it. We have learned a lesson from the Spanish Civil War and the Far East War, and we deeply understand that if we want to guarantee freedom of navigation in the Mediterranean and the security of French Indochina, we must maintain a strong navy. Therefore, the government has decided to start construction on two battleships, one cruiser, seven submarines, and various auxiliary ships (with a total tonnage of 24,000 tons) this year. In addition, coastal defenses have been strengthened and long prepared for any eventuality. (Havas dispatch, 9th)</p>

<h3>Polish Consulate in Czechoslovakia Pelted with Stones; Ukrainians Responsible; Poland Protests to Czechoslovakia</h3>
<p>Warsaw: According to the Polish Official Gazette, recently, due to the border conflict in Czechoslovakia, a group of demonstrators from the Carpathian Ruthenian military organization "Sich" threw bricks and stones at the Polish Consulate in Sughiz, destroying most of the windows. Local gendarmes did not intervene, citing the reason that the consulate had long been abandoned and no injuries would occur. The Polish chargé d'affaires has now lodged a formal protest with the Czech authorities, demanding a satisfactory response from both the Czech central government and the Ukrainian autonomous government. It is reported that the Polish chargé d'affaires reiterated that a full response must be given in order to be considered satisfactory. (Haitong dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Prague: Regarding the attack on the Polish Consulate in Sughiz, the Polish chargé d'affaires has lodged a protest with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

<h3>Romanian Iron Guard Plots to Assassinate King; Conspiracy Discovered</h3>
<p>(Paris) "Le Figaro" has recently reprinted news released by the diplomatic correspondent of the "London Daily Telegraph," claiming that London has received news proving that King Carol II of Romania was assassinated three or four days ago. Although the details are unknown, the assassin seems to be a member of the fascist Iron Guard (which has long been ordered to be disbanded). King Carol II was originally scheduled to meet with Prince Paul, the first regent of Yugoslavia, in Outer Transylvania before the 24th, but was postponed until yesterday, for this reason. (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Romanian Capital: Rumors that King Carol II was assassinated three or four days ago have been solemnly denied by officials here. After the fascist Iron Guard leader Codreanu was shot and killed by military police while trying to escape in late November last year, his followers received foreign aid and attempted to incite unrest. The police authorities have taken measures to prevent this and have arrested several people. (Combined dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3>Britain Deals with Pakistan Situation; War Office Announces Suppression Plan</h3>
<p>(London) The War Office has developed details of the truth about Palestine and practical plans to deal with the current situation there, in order to put an end to the activities of hostile figures and groups who engage in deceptive propaganda and fabricate news of atrocities committed by British troops in Palestine. The document states that the total number of actively rebellious traitors in all of Palestine is only between 1,000 and 1,500, divided into several small teams, who avoid contact with the military and mix with peaceful civilians, making them indistinguishable. The main leaders are Abdul Muhammad, who calls himself Commander-in-Chief, and Raik, both of whom are causing trouble in Samaria. The two men are constantly at odds, repeatedly declaring or openly breaking off relations and fighting each other. Now, the regiments without actual main leaders, with smaller leaders, are almost independent, each with its own agenda, even hostile to each other. Therefore, there is no permanent armed force for the military to suppress, and there is no central organization that can be destroyed to disintegrate the rebellion. In addition, an Arab group that opposes the rebellion has emerged, seeking to retaliate against those who support terrorist acts, further complicating the situation. The greatest difficulty faced by the military authorities is distinguishing between good and bad and identifying individuals. Sometimes, information is obtained about the names of a large number of rebels, but it is not easy to identify them. Therefore, it is necessary to search villages. The search method is to deploy troops or aircraft to set up a cordon in the area and prohibit residents from crossing it. Since this procedure is well-known, anyone who tries to cross the cordon can be determined to be trying to avoid the military. Some who crossed the cordon were attacked during the search. Propagandists claim that British soldiers massacred prisoners, which is largely due to this. Once the cordon is set up, the men in the village are gathered to identify each person. Those who are hiding are searched by house. Weapons and other contraband are occasionally found as a result. However, the authorities have strictly prohibited the military from looting and arbitrary destruction. Propagandists claim that British troops demolished entire batches of innocent Arab homes, which is completely unfounded. British troops only demolish designated houses for urgent reasons, and each village, regardless of whether it sympathizes with terrorism, generally harbors rebels. In recent months, anyone suspected of informing the government has been killed, so each village has been coerced by a small number of residents. As for the cities, the main rebels are either more educated upper-class figures or lower-class terrorist thugs. The former are forced by the fear of being harmed and only make recommendations, not issue orders. These people are mostly bishops and groups associated with the Church. The roundup of famous rebels involves many difficult procedures, as it is unavoidable that good and bad are mixed together. However, in the current situation, there is no other way. Regarding the search for weapons and ammunition, the authorities have warned residents not to hide items in unventilated places to avoid unnecessary losses. Women are not disturbed at all, and are only searched when female police officers are present. Mosques are never searched, except at the invitation of those responsible for their safekeeping and the village head. When searching, a military officer accompanies the search and directs it. Critics strongly criticize collective punishment, but they do not know that the Arab people of Palestine fully recognize and understand the principle of collective responsibility for crimes committed in an area. Collective punishment is actually the only way to force the majority of good and threatened residents to know that if they do not assist in maintaining order, the harm they suffer will ultimately be greater than the threat of obedience. Collective punishment is currently divided into two types: collective fines, which are not a military plan but are determined by civil servants, but are currently the responsibility of the mountain military commander; and collective demolition of houses, but this method is only applied after repeated warnings and must be approved by the General Headquarters before being implemented. This method is used to punish those who severely disrupt traffic, which is often seen. This measure is intended for the village people, but it clearly establishes the responsibility of the village. The document concludes by expressing regret for the need for military plans to restore order, but states that there is no other way. It also says that anyone who knows the truth about Palestine and understands the absolute necessity of ending the terrorist movement will not be misled by hostile propaganda.

<h3>Roosevelt to Submit Major National Defense Plan to Congress; Joint Meeting of House and Senate Armed Services Committees; Ambassadors to Britain and France Report on European Situation</h3>
<p>(Washington) Responsible sources have declared that President Roosevelt will soon submit a national defense message to Congress, in which the air force portion proposes an appropriation of $360,000,000 to build airplanes for the army, increasing the total number of first-line airplanes to 5,600, and $41,261,000 to build 900 airplanes for the navy, thus increasing the total number of airplanes for the army and navy to 10,000. To avoid disagreements among the Democratic Party during the discussion of national defense issues, President Roosevelt has reportedly decided to shelve the discussion. The army authorities also believe that after the first-line aircraft are increased to 5,600, they will be prepared for any eventuality. (Havas dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, the U.S. Ambassadors to Britain and France will attend a joint meeting of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees to support President Roosevelt's national defense program. Kennedy and Bullitt will present their observations on the European situation and submit documents recording the political and military situation in Europe after the Munich Conference at the committee meeting. It is reported that they will agree with President Roosevelt's plan to fully arm the United States to prevent foreign erosion of the Western Hemisphere. Currently, both Campbell and Burritt are on leave. Yesterday, the two met with Roosevelt and Acting Secretary of State Welles. Their meeting with President Roosevelt is particularly significant, as it comes at a time when Roosevelt is about to complete his special message on U.S. defense. According to plan, Roosevelt will submit his national defense message to Congress this week. It is unprecedented in American diplomatic history for U.S. ambassadors to foreign countries to attend committee meetings. According to custom, they should prepare reports on foreign events and submit them to the congressional committee. It is reported that the president will detail his entire program in his national defense message to Congress and specifically point out the purpose of the "$500 million" "mysterious" national defense fund. According to him, he has requested Congress to allocate these funds. Senior government officials expect that the majority of this fund will be used to develop the air force, so that the U.S. air force can be on an equal footing with any other country in the world (except Germany). (Associated Press dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The great new U.S. national defense plan has prompted army and navy officers to tighten their regulations on controlling military secrets. New rules to protect forts, warships, and military aircraft have been implemented. Foreign personnel outside aircraft manufacturing plants are subject to stricter surveillance. It is expected that Congress will approve funds to prevent espionage. According to military sources, cartographers and photographers who have not been officially approved will not be allowed to approach army garrisons, naval ships, and aircraft locations. These regulations are now being finalized. Foreign personnel serving in government supply agencies who are currently being dismissed or transferred due to suspicion have been investigated in detail by those responsible for various government executive agencies since 1926, and it has been found that a small number of employees do not yet have certificates of citizenship. The case of the capture of three spies in New York has drawn criticism from President Roosevelt, who believes that the currently allocated funds are not sufficient for the army and navy intelligence agencies and the Department of Justice to prevent espionage.

<h3>American Arms Dealers Voluntarily Stop Shipping Arms to Japan; Hull Appeals for Justice; Effective Since Last Autumn</h3>
<p>(Washington) According to news revealed here today, the "voluntary" ban on the transportation of military aircraft and bombs to Japan, encouraged by the U.S. Department of State, has been in effect since July 1, 1938. Also, according to news from the arms department, the "voluntary arms embargo exporters today issued a letter saying that Secretary of State Hull had made a strong appeal to American aircraft and arms exporters, saying that it was "the most important violation" of morality for the government to sell arms and trample on civilians. Although the Secretary of State did not specifically mention Japan, an arms embargo to Spain was already in effect. In addition, only China is currently at war with Japan, so it is not difficult to understand which country Hull was referring to. The association also said that all American companies unanimously agreed with the points stated in the Secretary of State's letter. According to Hull's letter, the State Department could only apologize for not being able to issue export licenses to exporters who transported arms to destroy civilians. According to Hull's letter, which began after Japan purchased millions of dollars worth of aircraft in the first six months of 1938, it was sent to major U.S. manufacturers. The arms department's report praised the State Department's export license system, but its shortcoming was that arms transported to third countries were still being transferred to Spain. As for the exception of shipping aircraft and bombs to Japan without the State Department's approval, the report did not specify, but said that if manufacturers could do as the State Department intended, Japan's purchase of American aircraft and bombs would be greatly hindered. Observers also said that with regard to the amendment of the Neutrality Act, the State Department may further use the experience of the past six months of private voluntary arms export bans to retaliate economically against aggressor countries.

<p>(Washington) According to the annual report of the National Munitions Control Board, Secretary of State Hull's appeal to American aircraft manufacturers not to supply aircraft or bombs to countries whose air forces have been criticized for bombing civilians has been fully effective in preventing the U.S. from supplying Japan with aircraft and bombs. Hull issued a call for voluntary cooperation from aircraft manufacturers on July 1 last year. Since then, the number of American aircraft shipped to Japan has been very small. In the previous six months, the total value of American aircraft shipped to Japan reached nearly $9 million. According to the annual report, all aircraft manufacturers except one agreed to cooperate with government policy. In 1938, the largest purchaser of American arms was the United Kingdom, totaling $29,611,000, mostly for military and non-military aircraft. Other purchasers of American arms included the Dutch East Indies, totaling $10 million; Japan, $9,241,000; China, $9,180,000; Argentina, $7,219,000; France, $6,446,000; and Canada, $3,171,000.

<h3>Patriotic Movement of Overseas Chinese in San Francisco: Banning War Materials from Being Shipped to Japan Receives Sympathy from the American People</h3>
<p>A special airmail dispatch from San Francisco on December 22nd, published by the Continental Daily News, states that there are 20,000 overseas Chinese households in San Francisco's Chinatown. The effect of their firing the first shot in the Sino-Japanese War last week may extend to the entire world, namely the prohibition by various nations of shipping war materials to Japan. The beginning of this sudden incident was when the local Chinese and sympathetic Americans placed pickets around the Greek tramp steamer "Spero," loaded with 2,500 tons of scrap iron and about to sail to Japan. This decision to demonstrate would have been dismissed as a local matter and dispersed if American dockworkers had refused to cooperate with the pickets. However, in fact, they assisted the pickets on December 16th, almost leading to a crisis. California's acting Governor, Peterson, representing California Governor Olson, addressed the pickets and expressed sympathy for the Chinese people. His speech briefly stated: "Public opinion and newspapers have been criticizing the transportation of war materials to Japan. Forward-thinking individuals have expressed support for democracy and opposition to aggressor nations... You have now taken action on this matter... Congress will soon convene, and the California legislature will also convene. Pressure must be applied to the legislators, and Mr. Havana, Mr. Wheelk, Mr. Toran, and all other legislators must be told that they must demand that Congress pass a law prohibiting ships from sailing to aggressor nations and declare Japan as an aggressor." Following him, Mr. Schmidt, Vice President of the Pacific Maritime Association, spoke on behalf of the International Longshoremen's Association and the Warehouse Workers Union, briefly stating: "We cannot ask any self-respecting person to disperse these Chinese people and load scrap iron that will be used to slaughter their compatriots... I have suggested to Mr. Ross of the Waterfront Employers Association that the entire matter should be discussed in a citywide meeting. He said it would be of no use. The attitude of the dockworkers immediately transformed what was initially a local matter into a major international event. American newspapers and radio stations have paid extraordinary attention to the issue of prohibiting transportation. Telegrams praising the Sino-American pickets have been sent to San Francisco from all over the world. At the same time, hundreds of American citizens have expressed their opposition to President Roosevelt and Acting Secretary of State Welles regarding the permission to transport war materials to Japan and have urged an immediate ban on such transportation. However, the Waterfront Employers Association, representing Pacific Coast ship owners, has not cooperated with the pickets. Mr. Ross issued an ultimatum to the pickets and American dockworkers on December 19th, demanding that the pickets disband and the allied workers resume work. According to Mr. Ross, he personally sympathizes with China completely, but on commercial principles, this trade cannot be stopped." That evening, the dockworkers held a meeting. Representatives of the Chinese pickets, such as Mr. Feng, Chairman of the American Chinese War Relief Association, and Peng Leshan (transliteration), the Chinese representative to the Second World Youth Congress, appealed to the allied workers to act in unison with them. A vote was immediately held, with 100% in favor. At the same time, through the efforts of the dockworkers, the Committee of Industrial Organizations also passed a resolution to convene a coast-wide conference of all labor, industrial, civic, and religious groups to study and assist in the embargo of war materials to Japan. On December 20th, the United Chinese Association, which was in charge of the picket operation, held an emergency meeting and resolved to remove the picket line. At that time, the "Spero" and the British ship "Buckingham" were already docked in the harbor. Mr. Feng declared the end of the picket line, stating that, "Today, we are withdrawing the demonstration from the San Francisco waterfront. We believe that this decision to place the picket line will uphold a great purpose, which is to have a peaceful but extremely powerful attitude. Newspapers across the country have recorded the achievements of our efforts. We have received telegrams from nationally renowned figures, large organizations, churches, and prominent citizens, praising our aims, guaranteeing to provide assistance, and protesting to President Roosevelt and other government officials in Washington. The result of the action we initiated here is expected to prohibit the transportation of war materials from the United States to Japan and to aid the democratic ideals of China in its fight. We now know that the vast majority of true Americans genuinely sympathize with us."</p>
<h3>Movement to Amend the U.S. Chinese Exclusion Act Gains Strong Public Support, but Opinions in Congress Remain Divided</h3>
<p>(Washington) Regarding the issue of amending the current Chinese Exclusion Act, observers generally believe that if Congress strongly resists and is unwilling to accept the amendment, the President will declare that the United States is not in danger of being drawn into the Spanish Civil War, and the Chinese Exclusion Act is no longer applicable to Spain. According to congressional figures and domestic public opinion, the amendment of the Chinese Exclusion Act is currently being hotly debated. Several members of Congress have also introduced motions in the House of Representatives, the contents of which are mostly contradictory. For example, the motions proposed by Faditz (Democrat) and Mar (Republican) call for the repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act, while Ludlow (Democrat) and Constone (Republican) call for the implementation of a military embargo on belligerent countries, even prohibiting the export of military supplies in peacetime. With such divergent opinions in Congress, public opinion is also divided. Various cultural organizations, religious groups, and medical associations are holding joint meetings here, advocating for the lifting of the arms embargo on Spain and recommending representatives to visit Acting Secretary of State Welles to declare that the current arms embargo is unfair. The Catholic Committee, however, opposes the lifting of this ban. However, with the support of a large part of public opinion, the government is encouraging the amendment movement in various ways, determined to implement its original proposal. Whether this matter can be realized in practice will be revealed once the Foreign Affairs Committees of the Senate and House of Representatives meet to discuss it. (Havas dispatch on the 9th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Senator Borah Opposes Sanctions: Would Rather Wage War Against Aggressor Nations Than Let Women and Children Freeze and Starve</h3>
<p>(Washington) Today, Senator Borah vehemently criticized the proposal that the United States should impose sanctions on aggressor nations. He said that he would rather the United States engage in war than let its women and children freeze and starve. He also said that sanctions are the fuse of war. "I would only support sanctions in a situation where I am willing to participate in the war myself. I do not consider this kind of action to be a peace movement." (Associated Press dispatch on the 10th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Council Against War Attacks Government Policy Out of Cowardice, Fearing Being Drawn into War</h3>
<p>(Washington) Today, the Council Against War attacked the government's plan to extend its naval bases in the Pacific, including expansion to Guam. In its weekly statement on foreign policy, the council stated that Herbert Bain's recent suggestion to expand the U.S. naval base to the Far East is tantamount to indicating that the United States is responsible for the defense of the Philippines, even after the Philippines has declared its independence. The council expressed attacks on President Roosevelt's new foreign policy, including increasing bases in the Pacific, amending the Chinese Exclusion Act, and plans to impose economic sanctions on aggressor nations. It also said that the most important of Rear Admiral Bain's suggestions last week was the construction of a naval base in Guam. The council specifically pointed out that Guam is 3,337 miles from Hawaii, located in the center of Japan's various dependencies, and situated on the route to the Philippines. If it is converted into a naval base, it will be sufficient to cancel the independent defense of the Philippines. The danger of this action is extremely obvious, because it has extended the area of our naval activity further away from our coast. Moreover, defending Guam carries the risk of being drawn into the vortex of war. On the other hand, it indicates that the Navy at least hopes that the United States will bear the burden of defending the Philippines at some point in the future. As for the cost of completing this new plan, it is not yet known, but naval experts estimate that it will require at least $200,000,000 to put Guam in a state of defense. According to Habun's report, fifteen of the forty-one bases urgently need to be completed immediately, including ten in the Pacific region. The more the United States focuses on the Pacific region, the more it will inevitably find itself in competition with Japan in the Far East. The council believes that we should try to avoid any action that could draw the United States into war, especially since establishing a strong base in Guam is bound to provoke strong opposition from Japan. As for the President's message to Congress, the first special proposal is the national defense plan. The government believes that American public opinion is ready to accept a large-scale expansion of the army and navy. However, if recent congressional or public opinion expresses support, the proposals for amending the Chinese Exclusion Act and imposing economic sanctions can be approached immediately. Regarding international conferences, the council believes that unless democratic countries can stop the actions of Japan, Germany, and Italy, no development is expected. Regarding the U.S. policy on the Spanish Civil War, the council said that the proposal to embargo arms is generally opposed. (Associated Press dispatch on the 9th)</p>
<h3>Achievements of the Pan-American Conference: Hull Returns Home and Gives a Speech</h3>
<p>(New York) Secretary of State Hull has returned here from the capital of Peru and has now arrived here. He immediately gave a speech on the achievements of the Eighth Pan-American Conference, briefly stating, "The principles passed by the Pan-American Conference are based on justice and freedom and set a precedent for international conduct, which is an indispensable foundation for establishing peaceful and friendly relations among countries around the world. There are three main achievements of the conference: (1) The resolution of the American republics to reduce tariff barriers and promote international trade; (2) The declaration of "Continental Solidarity of the Americas"; (3) The declaration of various "American Principles". Among them, the second is considered important. I firmly believe that these achievements will retain genuine and lasting value, and their importance will become increasingly clear in the future." Secretary of State Hull then said that the trade policies promoted by various totalitarian countries "are sufficient to weaken the position of the production sector, restrict the markets of various countries in the world, and use them under certain circumstances to expand political influence and strive to achieve control." This is incompatible with the free trade system accepted by the Pan-American Conference. Some parties have accused the United States of planning to conclude political or military alliance treaties with Latin American countries, which is not true. "What the United States hopes for is that the American republics will strengthen cooperative relations within the world's standing and within the Pan-American mechanism, so as to build peace, achieve economic well-being, and promote human rights. This hope has now been fully realized." (Havas dispatch on the 9th)</p>

<h3>A Prisoner of War Working with the New Fourth Army (Continued from Yesterday)</h3>
<p>—Yan Su, sent from Southern Anhui</p>
<p>(Question) How were you captured? (Answer) Two months later, I took a train from Shanghai to Nanjing, stayed in the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum for two days, and was then assigned to Zhenjiang. From Zhenjiang, I transported military supplies to Danyang. On the way, in a place called "Moling," we encountered the guerrillas of the New Fourth Army. At that time, there were more than fifty of us (Japanese soldiers). I don't know how many guerrillas there were. The battle lasted less than ten minutes. I was injured and fainted on the ground. Later, I was awakened by the sound of the horn calling for retreat. (Later, I learned that this was the sound of the New Fourth Army's horn.) Soon after, I was caught by the Chinese people and handed over to the New Fourth Army. (Question) What was your inner feeling when you were captured? (Answer) When I was captured, my eyes had been slightly injured. I thought there was no hope of survival because the officers told us that Chinese soldiers would kill Japanese prisoners. But after arriving here for three days and talking to a New Fourth Army comrade who understood Japanese, I realized that the actual situation was not like that. I have been here for three months, and I have been treated very well by the New Fourth Army. In addition to a very comfortable material life, they also give us books to read (Chinese books and progressive novels in Japanese), work to do (teaching soldiers Japanese, Japanese slogans, and making propaganda materials in Japanese), and the right to come and go freely (meaning the freedom to go out on the street to play - reporter). Therefore, my spiritual life is also very pleasant. (Question) If the New Fourth Army released you and sent you back to your country now, would you be willing? If so, what do you plan to do when you return to your country? (Answer) I am willing to return to my country. I will return to my country to unite with my friends to promote socialist and anti-war ideas. But that is probably impossible because if the Japanese military authorities know that I have returned to my country, they will definitely kill me. (Question) What is the situation in Japan now? What is the relationship between the people and the government? (Answer) Generally speaking, the Japanese people have recently become increasingly impoverished due to soaring prices and have a very unfavorable impression of the government. They have gradually begun to oppose it (mostly workers and the toiling masses). However, because of feudal traditions and superstition, most of them still inexplicably respect the Emperor. (Question) What are the most common diseases you see among Japanese soldiers in China? (Answer) Cholera, frostbite, and malaria are the most common. Cholera in summer, frostbite in winter, and malaria are year-round. (Question) What do you think is the future and outcome of the Sino-Japanese War? (Answer) The Sino-Japanese War will be a protracted war, that is certain. According to my estimation, it will take at least five years. The outcome of the war is that China will be able to achieve final victory, that is also certain. Because as the war drags on, Japan's manpower and material resources will increase, and at the same time, the anti-war forces of the people (including the Communist Party) will inevitably unite to overthrow the Japanese warlords. At that time, the Japanese central authorities, because they have no connection with the Japanese people in peacetime, will inevitably fall. (Question) What do you plan to do after the end of the Sino-Japanese War? (Answer) After the end of the Sino-Japanese War, I want to return to Japan, unite with my friends to discuss and promote the impressions and things I have learned here. (Question) How has your life been here for the past three months? (Answer) At first, I was not used to the food here, and there were some things I didn't dare to eat because I was afraid there would be problems. Now, I am not only used to it, but I also believe in it and am very satisfied with it. Therefore, I very much hope to help China defeat the Japanese warlords as a reward. (Question) Did anyone see you off when you left Japan? (Answer) Yes, the military authorities mobilized the people to send me off. (Question) Do you miss your family now? (Answer) At first, I missed them very much, but now it's a little better because the New Fourth Army has helped me communicate with my family. (Question) Do you have a lover? (Answer) Yes, she is still studying in Tokyo. (Question) How is she now? Do you miss her? (Answer) I don't know now. When she saw me off, she cried for me. Of course, I miss her very much. I am now asking the New Fourth Army authorities to find a way to communicate with her. If they can find a way to bring her to China, that is what I most hope for.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Singapore Eager to Register, Exceeding 160,000 People</h3>
<p>(Singapore) Overseas Chinese in Singapore, in accordance with the Chinese Foreign Ministry's regulations on registering overseas Chinese and registering as Chinese citizens, have now reached more than 160,000 people. According to official statements, this decision to register is not a plan for the Chinese government to implement conscription among overseas Chinese. Although the British government regards Chinese born in the Straits Settlements as British citizens, the Chinese government recognizes them as Chinese citizens and is also eligible to register. As far as the Chinese government is concerned, all Chinese, regardless of where they reside, are Chinese citizens, and they are subject to Chinese law when they return to China (Reuters dispatch on the 10th).</p>

<h3>The New Fourth Route Army Focuses on Work Among the People, Receiving Assistance Everywhere in Combat; The Political Department Vigorously Organizes the People</h3>
<p>Continued communication from Belden, a special correspondent for the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post, from the headquarters of the New Fourth Route Army south of Wuhu: The New Fourth Route Army focuses on work among the people. The leaders of the army believe that the guarantee of victory in war depends not only on military strength but also on the masses. According to the officers of the army, the victory of guerrilla warfare is indispensable to the assistance of the people. Because guerrilla forces have inferior weapons, they must know the enemy's situation before each battle. It is not easy for soldiers unfamiliar with the area to obtain this detailed information, but it can be obtained from the people who are familiar with the local terrain and situation. If the troops want to cross the river and do not know where to cross it, the organized people can tell the troops where there are small paths or roads to pass through. The activity of guerrilla warfare is valued for its speed. The location of the army must be kept secret, and spies must be eradicated. This kind of work depends entirely on the people. The people can assist the wounded to the rear and return to their homes to recuperate them because there are no hospitals in the countryside. During the battle, the people can also shout to cheer or fire behind the enemy, making the enemy panic and unaware of how many troops there are on the other side. All of this is only from a military point of view, so the New Fourth Route Army believes that work among the people is very important. The New Fourth Route Army has five goals: (1) Mobilize the people to assist the army, guide the way, and report the enemy's situation; (2) Encourage the people to cooperate with the army and fight behind the enemy; (3) Arm the local people to fight independently; (4) Encourage the people to expose traitors and maintain local order; (5) Encourage the people not to supply the enemy with necessities, food, and information. The New Fourth Route Army aims to gain the trust of the people, conduct propaganda work among the people, establish people's organizations, organize the people, establish armed teams, and provide them with military training in order to achieve its goals. Because China has historically despised soldiers, it is not easy to gain the faith of the people at first. However, if the soldiers are instructed to care for the people, the people will gradually care for the soldiers and trust the army. According to the army, they do not force conscription, nor do they force farmers to serve, so they have won the trust of the people. According to Deputy Director of the Political Department Tang Shihui (transliteration), when the New Fourth Route Army first arrived at a town near Jinhua, the people locked their doors and some fled the town. However, the army did not disturb their order, stationed troops outside the town, and sang songs. Then, they sent several unarmed officers into the town to tell the people that they were the New Fourth Route Army and told the people the rules of the army. But the people did not believe them. Then, several old people came out of the town and saw that they were polite and gradually believed them. Finally, they invited the army into the town. When the army left the town, the people held a grand farewell party and lit firecrackers to send them off. After the New Fourth Route Army won the trust of the people, they tried to educate the people, telling them how barbaric the Japanese army was, why the New Fourth Route Army was fighting the Japanese army, and why the people should give assistance. They also told the people that we must fight against fascism and countries in the world that do not love peace. We are fighting Japan for independence and fighting fascism for world peace. This kind of work is all carried out through propaganda, such as through the people's newspapers, street speeches, tea parties, singing, acting, painting, photography, and communications. The newspaper called "Save the Nation" is published every ten days, but now it has new equipment and hopes to change it to a three-day publication. The army also holds army-people get-togethers, performing entertainment and speeches. Each part of the army also holds tea parties. For example, the officers of the general staff recently held this meeting, buying sugar, vegetables, and other things for three yuan and inviting a representative from each household in the town where the staff lived to participate. During the banquet, the guests were asked to tell the army's shortcomings. Whenever the New Fourth Route Army arrives in a town, the political department will gather the children of the people, sing loudly, and explain the meaning of the lyrics. Therefore, wherever I go, I hear children singing songs learned from the New Fourth Route Army. Before the army performs a play, it must post advertisements. The people are attracted to go to the theater, but the plays performed are slightly different from the plays watched by the soldiers. The plays watched by the soldiers all reflect the war, but the plays watched by the people focus on the people's assistance to the army, eliminating traitors, engaging in espionage, and destroying highways. This kind of play is deeply loved by the people. The New Fourth Route Army attempts to organize the people and first conducts propaganda work so that the people can know what their responsibilities are. When the propaganda work is completed, two hundred young men and women from the political department are dispatched to mobilize and organize the people to assist in organizing anti-Japanese united associations, such as the Women's Anti-Japanese United Association and the Businessmen's Anti-Japanese United Association. Organizing a united association is easy, but it is not easy to make the association provide real service during the war. The Anti-Japanese Farmers United Association near the general headquarters is an organization automatically organized by farmers. Its slogans are: (1) Assist the government and the New Fourth Route Army in fighting Japan; (2) Guarantee the lives of farmers; (3) Increase agricultural income; (4) Farmers unite and cooperate with each other; (5) If there are disputes, the association will resolve them; (6) Promote education. The New Fourth Route Army has established night schools to teach singing and reading newspapers, and has opened short-term training courses near the front lines to train the masses, explain the theory of protracted war, and the national revival program set by the National Government. Each class is one month long, but the New Fourth Route Army also wants the people to fight, not only to assist the army in combat, but also for the people to fight independently. Therefore, they urge the people to organize guerrilla forces. The teams that have been organized in the past will unanimously fight against the Japanese army. They should always be prepared to cultivate the land, and in wartime, they will fight the enemy. These armed teams are usually organized in units of one guarantee (bao), with each bao having one thousand people. On average, eighty people have hunting rifles, broadswords, or spears. If a small number of Japanese troops come, they will be united to drive them away. If the enemy comes in large numbers, each team will try its best to resist, so that the families can leave safely. It is said that before this kind of team was organized, three or four Japanese troops could come and seize women at will, but today, the Japanese army does not dare to come without forming a large team.

<h3>Hua Army in Southern Shandong Recovers Tancheng; Remnants of Japanese Army Flee to Linyi; Setting up Fake Cannons to Create False Impression; No Trace of Japanese Troops in Rizhao and Juxian</h3>
<p>Xuzhou Dispatch: Recently received a report from southern Shandong that the Japanese troops who invaded the southern part of Taiwei Road were the Yekan unit that fled from Linyi. It consisted of only about 500 infantry soldiers, accompanied by more than 20 armored vehicles, including more than ten cargo trucks, and equipped with a considerable number of small cannons. However, due to the small number of troops, there were not enough to distribute, so many fully armed rubber mannequins were loaded onto the armored vehicles. At night, fearing attacks from guerrillas, they would drive the armored vehicles back to Tancheng County and deflate the rubber mannequins. This back-and-forth operation shows how they were creating a false impression. Therefore, after the Japanese troops invaded east from Matou, Tancheng, to the west bank of Mao Cao River and the town of Chongxing, they feared guerrilla attacks and were unable to advance further. When the vigorous reinforcements from the Donghai detachment of the Chinese army arrived, they were met with a head-on attack. The enemy's forces were routed, and Yekan led his troops to flee to Linyi. A vigorous reinforcement unit of the Chinese army also tracked and advanced. Mao Cao River and Chongxing Town were still garrisoned by the Jiangsu-Shandong guerrillas. Furthermore, the army, well-known for its success in killing enemies, also arrived in large numbers. From then on, the defense of the Jiangsu-Shandong border area became even more secure. Currently, the guerrilla forces are continuing to track and pursue the enemy on one side, while on the other side, Chen Guan Jin, the commander of the Tancheng regular brigade, has led his troops to garrison Tancheng, issuing announcements to reassure the people. The market in Matou has returned to its former state. The Tancheng County government office was damaged in many places by Japanese artillery fire, but it has now been largely repaired. County Magistrate Liang of Tancheng led his subordinates to return to the old county seat on December 11th to resume work as usual and issued announcements to reassure the people. Residents who had sought refuge in the surrounding villages have returned to the city one after another. The streets in the city have also been completely cleaned, and order has been fully restored. It is reported that when the Japanese army occupied Tancheng, they originally planned to invade eastward, but were blocked by the Yi and Shu rivers. In addition, armed civilians in various villages took the opportunity to attack from time to time. The Japanese army had a total of no more than a thousand men, more than ten cannons, and thirty to forty armored vehicles. In addition, the Chinese army rushed to the scene and launched a head-on attack, so the Japanese army did not dare to go deep. It is also learned that there is currently no trace of Japanese troops in the territories of Rizhao and Juxian counties. However, there are four to five hundred puppet troops of Liu Guitang's unit in Zhucheng, and more than a thousand puppet troops of Zhang Buyun's unit and others north of Zhucheng, arbitrarily causing trouble in various villages. The army and the route army are deploying defenses south of Zhucheng. As for the Japanese troops in Linyi, there are only about fifty men who are holed up in the city all day long, not daring to venture out into the countryside, fearing guerrilla attacks. Not long ago, two Japanese transport vehicles, one carrying military supplies such as ammunition, and the other carrying more than twenty Japanese soldiers, intended to go to Fei County. However, as soon as they left the west gate of Linyi City about two or three miles, they were attacked by nine guerrilla heroes ambushing on both sides of the road. They first threw hand grenades, completely destroying the two vehicles and rendering them immobile. Then, they took advantage of the situation to shoot and stab more than twenty Japanese soldiers to death, annihilating them all. Upon hearing the news, the remaining Japanese troops in Linyi had to keep the city gates half-open and half-closed, unlike before when they were wide open. They also set up fake cannons and rubber mannequins (dressed in yellow military uniforms) on the city towers to create a false impression.</p>
<h3>Shengsi Islands: Japanese Army Considers Them in the Bag; Japanese and Korean Rogues Commit Large-Scale Arson and Robbery; Bandits Also Take the Opportunity to Harass</h3>
<p>Chongming Dispatch: The Shengsi Islands, isolated from the sea outside Chongming, have been considered in the Japanese army's grasp since the August 13th Shanghai Battle. Large numbers of huge Japanese warships pass through here. Many of the sailors on the Japanese warships are from Dinghai. In the villages where Japanese soldiers arrive, they commit arson, murder, rape, and all sorts of evils. Pigs, sheep, chickens, and ducks are all captured. There are thousands of families on the island, mainly engaged in fishing and farming. There are also commercial markets and shops, but they are not very large. There are the most fish businesses. The Japanese force the fishermen to sell their catches to New Shanghai (the Japanese call Yangshupu New Shanghai). The residents are most afraid of three-ply boats. On the boats are Japanese rogues and Koreans, dressed in rags, with beards all over their faces. They plunder people's property and will not let anything go. When they see Chinese people, they grab their necks and throw them forcefully, taking it as a joke. Recently, there have been slightly fewer Japanese, but the sea bandits Xu Baolong, Wang Yagen, and others are also extremely rampant. The bandit gang is very large. They have collected abandoned weapons from the Chinese army and are disturbing the people by rallying crowds to cause trouble. Goods in stores are often robbed, not to mention money. Gunshots are heard day and night, causing fear. Torture and coercion are unspeakable. Therefore, when fish businesses on the island sell fish to Shanghai, they generally use remittances to avoid carrying cash, lest they be robbed along the way.</p>

<h3>Special Shanghai Edition: Shanghai's Financial Market (Continued from Yesterday)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yifan</p>
<p>(6) Foreign Exchange Control and Black Market Activities: The foreign exchange control implemented in early March of this year should be recorded as a major event in the history of our country's monetary system, following the reform of the currency system. The author has published many articles on this topic in this newspaper's economic section and other newspapers and magazines, which can be consulted for reference. In short, all foreign exchange needs must be applied for through the Central Bank and approved by the Central Bank. For those who have been approved, the bank will supply the full amount at the legal rate of one shilling and two and a half pence. Therefore, when ordering goods from abroad, it is necessary to obtain approval first; imported foreign goods cannot be released without an approval certificate. This is not only to save foreign exchange for military use but also to protect national industries and promote thrift and frugality. As for exports, all foreign exchange generated must be sold to the Central Bank, which will issue a certificate, and then the goods can be shipped. Otherwise, the customs and railway bureaus can intercept and prohibit their export. At the same time, to protect the interests of exporters, the state will provide compensation and special treatment for transportation, insurance, and losses incurred when selling in foreign markets. This not only promotes export trade but also greatly increases domestic production. All our citizens should give it practical cooperation and comply with it. Only in this way can we protect our wealth and achieve long-term development.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Shanghai is located in an occupied area, and foreign banks prioritize their own commercial interests. When our country implemented the foreign exchange declaration system, they refused to cooperate and were thus exploited, actively promoting their work to undermine the legal currency. Traitors even took the opportunity to speculate on foreign exchange and flee with their funds; they even engaged in short-selling and large-scale speculation. As a result, the legal currency experienced a sharp decline in the foreign exchange black market, creating a situation that was difficult to reverse, as shown in the following table: foreign exchange, was secretly authorized by the Central Bank, which may not be accurate. However, it is just an atmosphere created by speculators.</p>
<p>Moreover, since the silver agreement continued to be in effect and Sino-US and Sino-British loans were established; in addition, various circles in Japan realized that the current work of undermining the legal currency can only affect China's foreign trade and cannot shake the confidence of the Chinese people in the legal currency. Therefore, there are those who advocate using the legal currency to implement their economic activities in the occupied areas of China. In addition, China has always been cautious about the issuance of legal currency and never inflates it slightly. The people have always hoarded legal currency, treating it as cash; they refuse to accept counterfeit and inferior currencies. Even those who are forced to use it under coercion only use it with the left hand and then pass it out with the right hand. Therefore, the changes in the foreign exchange black market only cause losses to speculators and importers. Its domestic value has not changed slightly. As for the current rise in domestic prices, it is due to the imbalance between the supply and demand of the goods themselves.</p>
<p>(7) The Revival of the Securities Market and the Government Bonds Market: Originally, it was also a place for speculators to operate. Before the implementation of the unified government bond system, the monthly turnover often reached four to five million yuan per year. Since the exchange of old government bonds and the issuance of unified new government bonds unified the past disparate bond prices into five types: A, B, C, D, and E, and the government invisibly manipulated them, the bond market no longer experienced the sharp rises and falls as before, and speculators suddenly lost their means of stirring up trouble. Therefore, the total turnover for the entire year of 1936 fell sharply to more than two million yuan. However, since the Shanghai stock exchanges sparked a fierce speculative frenzy in the early summer of 1937, the bond market was inevitably affected. Therefore, the total turnover from January to July of that year reached more than two million yuan. After the outbreak of the Shanghai Battle, the stock exchanges closed, but it was not long before spot trading began to take place in secret. Although this kind of trading is illegal, it still has its understandable reasons in the special organization of the Shanghai financial market.</p>
<p>The Shanghai banking industry regards government bonds as a variable cash reserve. It is not only regarded as a kind of securities investment, but also as a method to adjust the lending of funds. When there is a lot of floating capital, government bonds are purchased and stored, and when there is a shortage, they are sold on the market. The suspension of the stock exchange means that the banking industry suddenly lost a public market for circulating funds. Therefore, the secret implementation of spot transactions after the outbreak of the war was necessary for the deployment of funds.</p>
<p>However, one thing is puzzling: at that time, it was said that the black market price was more than 30 yuan lower than the price before the war. Why didn't the bondholders apply for mortgage credit from the joint reserve organization of the banking industry or even the discounting committee, and were willing to sell their bonds at a discount? It can be seen that this kind of transaction is not entirely spot, in other words: it is not purely for the purpose of circulating funds. Because of this, the initial trading volume was very small.</p>
<p>Since Shanghai fell, the effectiveness of national law has been reduced invisibly. Stimulated by the black market transaction of foreign exchange, government bond speculators began to show their faces publicly. In March and April of this year, there was an organization called the "Mingtan Association" (see the author's "Past and Present of the Shanghai Securities Market," which will be published in this newspaper soon) that carried out illegal transactions.</p>
<p>The existence of this illegal transaction directly affects the credit of government bonds; indirectly, it shakes the reserve value of various banks. Therefore, the Chinese Securities Exchange once requested to resume business. Although the government did not allow it, it seemed to understand the exchange's attempt to eliminate the illegal behavior of the aforementioned "Mingtan Association" in a semi-public market. Because the aforementioned transaction is purely organized by speculators, its actions are quite dangerous; it is easy to cause the bond credit to be severely hit. If a semi-public market appears and original securities brokers are allowed to operate trading, it will be easier to control. It is also easier to maintain bond credit. Therefore, since the market started its activities, the prices of various bond markets have begun to recover and are now Yun Lie. Although it has been repeatedly affected by changes in the war situation, it has been able to overcome each difficulty. However, it is still far from the lowest price announced before the war. Therefore, many parties are unwilling to enter the market, and only retail investors enter and exit every day.</p>
<p>Since the sharp fall in foreign exchange, the prices of goods imported from Europe and the United States have soared. This is tantamount to offering the market in China to Japan. Japan has free access to the occupied areas and can refuse to pay various taxes; the cost of goods from Europe and the United States is originally more expensive than Japanese goods, and it is even more expensive due to the soaring exchange rate. Although it can use the psychology of the Chinese people who vow not to buy enemy goods to be slightly active; when the exchange rate soars sharply, it is difficult to freely compete with department stores. Therefore, after the legal currency fell sharply, European and American merchants realized their mistakes and had to come forward to maintain the exchange rate of the legal currency for their own benefit. Our country can ignore the activities of the black market. Because not only can foreign trade profit from it, but the finance has foreign exchange funds available for external payments, and it is not slightly affected by the influence of the black market exchange rate. Moreover, if maintenance is implemented, it is tantamount to promoting foreign exchange speculation, so why implement foreign exchange control in the first place? Therefore, the sale of HSBC and Hong Kong transmitted by the outside world.</p>
<h3>Benevolent Deeds of American People: Large Quantities of Relief Goods Shipped to Shanghai; Including American Wheat, Medicines, and Baby Food; Ship Owner of the "S.S. Sachuest" Donates Free Shipping</h3>
<p>The American people, sympathizing with China's resistance against aggression and based on human nature, were concerned about the Chinese people who were displaced due to foreign aggression. They raised relief funds and purchased American wheat, medicines, and other goods to ship to China. These American relief goods arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 9th). The details are as follows:</p>
<p>American Ship Loaded: Arrived in Shanghai the Night Before Last</p>
<p>These goods include 3,360,000 pounds of broken wheat, packed into 24,000 bags, entrusted to the American Red Cross for handling and shipped to China on the American ship "S.S. Sachuest." The ship departed from New York in late October last year and arrived in Hong Kong on the 4th of this month. In Hong Kong, 8,000 bags were unloaded and handed over to the Chinese Red Cross for relief to refugees in southern China. The remaining 16,000 bags were loaded and brought to Shanghai, arriving at the Huasheng Wharf in Hongkou at 5 pm on the 9th, preparing for unloading.</p>
<p>Christmas Gifts: Relief for Refugee Children</p>
<p>At the same time, in addition to this American wheat, the relief goods transported by this ship also include many "Christmas gifts" donated by major American commercial firms to relieve Chinese refugee children. Among them, there are several tons of canned beef, milk, milk powder, biscuits, etc., as well as quinine and surgical medicines, etc., which are used for relief to infants and refugees.</p>
<p>Ship Owner Generously: Waives Freight</p>
<p>As for the "S.S. Sachuest" ship, it is a new ship leased by the American Weili Han Shipping Company from the American tax. This is the first time the ship has come to Shanghai, and it will operate on the newly established route of the Weili Han Shipping Company in this port. This time, the shipowner generously waived the freight for the relief goods and voluntarily shipped them from the United States to China. All parties are grateful for the benevolent act of the shipowner. It is reported that the ship will stay in Shanghai for three days and will leave Shanghai tomorrow or the day after tomorrow to open the port.</p>
<p>Reported in Western Newspapers: The Course of Shipping to Shanghai</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reported that the American cargo ship "Sachuest," carrying the first batch of wheat donated by the United States to Chinese civilians who suffered during the war, arrived in Shanghai last night (the 9th). The wheat was harvested in the United States last year and amounted to 1,600 tons. It was handed over by the US Department of Agriculture to the American Red Cross and then to the Shanghai International Red Cross Committee. It will be unloaded from the ship and transferred to barges this afternoon. According to President Roosevelt's resolution with his cabinet to donate some of the US surplus wheat to war refugees in China and Spain, the wheat was transported here. The wheat donated to Spain will be given to civilians in both the government and nationalist areas, while in China, it will be distributed to areas in need, regardless of which party's labor is in control. In addition to wheat, canned meat, milk, baby food, and essential surgical medicines were also brought by the "S.S. Sachuest" and entrusted to the Red Cross Committee in this port. It is said that these items were purchased with funds donated by American schoolchildren and charitable organizations. The "S.S. Sachuest" departed from New York, passing through the Panama Canal, Manila, and Hong Kong to reach here. It passed Yangshupu at 4:50 pm yesterday and docked at the Gonghexiang Wharf. The Shanghai agency for the ship is the Weili Han Company. The company is responsible for the loading and unloading of the wheat in this port, and the ship was dispatched by the US Maritime Commission.</p>
<h3>Hua Army Secretly Crosses the Qiantang River; Troops Head to Pinghu; Highway Bridges Diligently Demolished; Japan Attempts to Reinforce Hangzhou Troops</h3>
<p>Kuai Xun News Agency, this port dispatch: According to well-informed sources from the Haiyan compatriots in Shanghai, since Haiyan was recaptured by the regular troops of the Hua army, the Japanese army in Hangzhou and Jiaxing has been under threat. The situation in the Hangzhou, Haiyan, and Pinghu areas is very tense, and a fierce battle is about to unfold in the eastern theater. In recent days, news from Hangzhou indicates that the Hua army in Zhejiang Province is preparing a large-scale counterattack on Hangzhou. At the same time, the Japanese army on the eastern section of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway has been decreasing day by day. A large number of troops have been transferred west along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, and it is believed that they are heading to the Hangzhou area, seemingly in an attempt to strengthen their forces in that area. As for the secret river-crossing troops of the Hua army, a large number of them have also headed to the Pinghu area. All the highways in the area have been demolished by the Hua army, leading the local people, not only destroying all the bridges but also demolishing the road surface. Therefore, the Japanese army is currently only relying on railway transportation. In addition, the Jiaxing Japanese army has increased its troops by more than a thousand, and the Chang'an Japanese army has largely been transferred to Haining, in order to defend against the Hua army's pincer attack from Haiyan and Pinghu. Therefore, the Chinese side generally believes that the counterattack on the eastern front has begun, and the Hua army will definitely be able to gain an advantage.</p>
<h3>British and American Defense Forces Form Patrol Teams; Maintain Security in West Shanghai; Diligently Patrol Within Their Respective Garrison Areas; American Army Holds Gas Defense Drill Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The Public Concession authorities, in order to rectify the security in West Shanghai, have been paying attention to prevention and defense for days, and are very vigilant. The British and American defense forces stationed in Shanghai have also organized patrol teams to assist. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>British and American Defense Forces: Form Patrol Teams</p>
<p>The British and American defense forces stationed in Shanghai, considering that discipline is lax and illegal cases are emerging in the area along the border of the Kunsu Concession Road, have organized several small patrol teams, each with five people, starting from the date of the decision to close the counterfeit "Police Branch" on the Daxi Road, to assist the police force in guarding the Concession. Each team is on duty in shifts within their respective garrison areas. When necessary, they also conduct strict inspections of pedestrians and vehicles coming and going. The patrol is very serious, and the residents of West Shanghai feel safe.</p>
<p>American Army Holds: Gas Defense Drill</p>
<p>The American defense forces stationed in Shanghai held a gas defense drill in the Haifang Road area of West Shanghai at 8 am yesterday. More than 400 people participated in the drill, each wearing gas masks and various application equipment. The actions were very rapid and the results were excellent. During the drill, the surrounding traffic was completely cut off, and the American army deployed defenses separately. The drill was not completed until after 10 am, and the team was withdrawn to the camp. The traffic in the area was then restored to its original state.</p>
<h3>Moufu Ship Returns to Shanghai Today; Sails to Ningbo to Load Goods; Anna Ship Also Specifically Approved to Sail to Ningbo; Direct Shanghai-Ningbo Release Still Under Negotiation</h3>
<p>The German Lihe Shipping Company's Moufu ship, with the approval of the Tenth Army Group Headquarters, was allowed to sail from Shanghai to Wenzhou and then to Ningbo to load goods. It was also allowed to return to Shanghai for direct release, but for a limited period of three times. Since the ship was approved, it quickly continued sailing to Ningbo to load silk cocoons. It returned to Shanghai yesterday from Ningbo for direct release and will arrive in port this morning. The three-time period has expired. However, the company believes that there are still many silk cocoons in Ningbo, so it applied to the Zhejiang Provincial Military Authorities for permission to continue sailing. It is now known that it has been approved to continue sailing once. Therefore, after the ship arrives in Shanghai to unload today, it will definitely sail to Wenzhou and then to Ningbo tomorrow. It is also learned that the Anna ship has also been approved and is scheduled to sail from Ou to Ningbo today or tomorrow.</p>
<p>Weili Han Ship: Opens Shanghai-Ningbo Route</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reported that the American Weili Han Shipping Company will send a ship to Ningbo on Saturday (the 14th) to start shipping services between Shanghai and Ningbo. The other three ships will also start sailing shortly after the first ship leaves. According to the company, it recently obtained a license from the Chinese government to send four ships to the ports of Zhejiang Province. Yesterday (the 9th), personnel from the company said that they would temporarily dispatch rented ships to sail.</p>

<p>The Yin County Party, government, military, and police agencies held a joint meeting on January 3rd, attended by Guo Chiping, Yu Jimin, Xu Zhen, Chen Defa, Chen Baolin, Zhong Zhihan, Wu Zemin, etc., chaired by Yu Jimin. Regarding the Yin County Party Department's letter to the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce requesting that restrictions be added to the water fees and passenger tickets of various ships, and the Ning Shao Shipping Company's telegram stating the reasons for the increase in Shanghai-Ningbo ship water fees and tickets, and requesting permission for direct Shanghai-Ningbo release to reduce expenses in both cases, they were discussed together. It was decided to hand them over to the County Government and the County Party Department to discuss detailed methods with the Chamber of Commerce and the Ship Association Report Customs Association. It is heard that the principle of direct Shanghai-Ningbo shipping has been approved by the previous shipping conference.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Dinghai Interrupted: Dinghai-Ningbo as Usual</p>
<p>The Shan Tai, Hana of German Far East, Haifu of German Lihe, Gaodeng of German Lulin, and Tangbei of American Huamei, etc., five ships of the Lanshang Zhengde Company, which operate the Shanghai-Taiwan line and also serve Wan Dinghai, have been ordered to temporarily suspend serving Wan Dinghai and have not yet resumed sailing. Now the Taiwan-Ningbo line's Tangsai of Huamei Company, and the Taiwan-Ningbo line's Meida of Meili Company, have also been ordered to stop serving Wan Dinghai. Therefore, the sailing of Taiwan-Dinghai and Shanghai-Dinghai has been completely interrupted. However, the sailing between Ningbo and Dinghai, the reporter of Xin Sheng News Agency obtained definite news from the shipping industry yesterday, that the German Far East Company's Tianbao and the Portuguese Zhengde Company's Libao still sail as usual. Therefore, the sailing between Yong Dinghai is as usual. The one that was hit by the shell was a building of the Bilian Hospital. The flames were caused by the star and affected the hospital property of the church. Although the hospital has been completely destroyed, the hospital staff were still able to rescue most of the equipment.</p>

<h3>Boy Scout Fiftieth Regiment Member: Cang Chengquan Sacrifices Life in the Line of Duty; Escorting Medicines to Guiyang; Dies from Malaria</h3>
<p>Cang Chengquan, a member of the Boy Scout Fiftieth Regiment in this city, was a seventh-term member, from Minhou, Fujian, 23 years old, and worked at the Chunsheng Sporting Goods Company. He was very enthusiastic during normal regiment training. After the outbreak of the August 12th war, the Fiftieth Regiment responded to the invitation of the Chinese Red Cross to provide first aid and transportation services. Cang Jun swore to participate and never slackened. He was accustomed to entering and leaving the battlefield in Shanghai. In addition, he gave blood to the injured Chen Xingsun, a member of the same regiment, showing both bravery and righteousness, and was deeply admired and respected. When the National Army moved west, Cang Jun continued to follow the regiment to work in the war zone, traveling thousands of miles through Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Guizhou, without complaining of fatigue. Previously, he learned that his mother had died, and although he was extremely saddened, he did not return home for the funeral in order to serve the country. Recently, he was ordered to escort a vehicle of medicines to Guizhou and was attacked by malaria. A swelling appeared on his chest, and after medical treatment, he died on the 31st of last month at the Central Hospital in Guiyang. In addition to sending personnel to handle the aftermath, the regiment has also reported to the General Red Cross Association for record-keeping through the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, which is in charge. A telegram was sent to the regimental headquarters, expressing the extreme respect for Cang Jun, who sacrificed his life in the line of duty, and expressing the hope that the funeral matters would be handled carefully.</p>
<h3>Guilin American Hospital Internally Destroyed by Fire; Japanese Planes Drop Incendiary Bombs, Neighboring Houses Catch Fire and Are Affected</h3>
<p>Continental Daily reports that the Guilin American Southern Baptist Hospital was severely damaged by fire internally on December 30th when Japanese planes flew over the city and dropped incendiary bombs. Yesterday (9th), the hospital's Shanghai office confirmed this to reporters. However, there were no inpatients in the hospital at the time because the Japanese planes had previously indiscriminately bombed Guilin, forcing patients to evacuate the city. It is uncertain whether the hospital was directly hit by bombs. When the foreign staff returned to the hospital, the sides of the buildings were completely burned, making it impossible to determine where the fire started. However, it is believed that "Today is the sixth redemption of principal for the 25th Year of the Republic Reconstruction Public Bonds. The lottery method uses the last three digits of the bond number. Now, I will briefly report the details of the aforementioned public bonds to everyone. The Reconstruction Public Bonds were issued in February of the 25th year of the Republic with a fixed amount of 340 million national currency. This is the sixth redemption of principal, drawing five bonds, each worth 340,000 yuan, for a total principal redemption of 1.7 million yuan. The principal and matured interest of the winning bonds will be paid starting February 28th of the 28th year of the Republic, through the Central Bank of various regions and its designated Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Central Trust Bureau. Now, please have the supervisors inspect the drawn bonds and the register of bonds to be drawn to carry out the lottery." Immediately afterwards, the lottery will begin. The winning numbers are recorded as follows: "090," "298," "663," "787," "901." Starting today, the National Debt Fund Management Committee will issue a public announcement so that everyone is aware.</p>

<h3>The Fake "City Government" Levies Land Tax, Implementing a Policy of Arbitrary Taxes and Levies; Fake Tax Collection Offices Established in Various Districts, Forcing Farmers to Register and Pay</h3>
<p>The fake "City Government," due to financial difficulties and the inability to make up for deficits, had no choice but to resort to arbitrary taxes and levies on the general impoverished and helpless people. In addition to forcibly seizing 1,000 mu of farmland in the Gaoqiao area of Pudong a few days ago, yesterday they issued a "proclamation" to collect "land tax," and have established "tax collection offices" in Zhoupu, Jiangwan, Yinhang, and Fengxian in Pudong, forcing farmers to register and pay within a time limit. The fake "Mayor" initially claimed to be working for the "welfare of the people" as a facade, but this move is completely counterproductive. His mask of harming the country and the people has been exposed, and the people are filled with resentment, which is evident in their expressions.</p>

<h3>Thrifty Relief Association Circular, Striving to Collect Funds; Generated 40,000 in Donations in April; Develop a Style of Perseverance</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Thrifty Relief Association sent a circular to various collection banks, firms, companies, and newspapers yesterday, requesting them to continue their efforts in collecting funds to relieve refugees and cultivate thrift. The original circular is recorded below:</p>
<p>Issuing a Notice</p>
<p>"We are writing to inform you that since our association advocated thrifty relief, we have received your assistance in collecting funds, and all sectors have responded enthusiastically. In the past four months, we have received 40,000 in donations. If we calculate that 2 yuan is needed per month to provide for a refugee, then 40,000 yuan can support 20,000 refugees. These 40,000 yuan have all come from all sectors saving on clothing, food, reducing expenses, and hobbies. From the perspective of the donors themselves, they have cultivated the virtue of thrift. From the perspective of the refugees who benefit, it is truly benevolence and mutual assistance. In summary, its significance is not only charitable but also educational. However, the reason why we have achieved this success is largely due to the hard work and support of your colleagues, which our association will never forget. However, disaster relief still requires continued efforts, and thrift must be maintained for a long time to form a trend and not be abandoned halfway. Therefore, we specially request that your office continue to assist us as before. All collections will be handled as before. All funds voluntarily paid for thrifty relief, designated for thrifty relief, will be issued with official receipts from our association and reported to the association at any time. In this way, refugees will be blessed, and society will benefit. Not only will our association be grateful."</p>
<p>Collecting Agencies</p>
<p>In addition to all newspapers in the city uniformly collecting donations, the names of other firms, companies, and banks that collect thrifty relief are as follows: Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Jin Cheng Bank, Zhong Nan Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank and its branches, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, China Farmers Bank, China National Products Bank, China General Chamber of Commerce Bank, Salt Industry Bank, China Industrial Bank, Continental Bank, China Reclamation Bank, Shanghai Bank and its branches, Guohua Bank, Zhongfu Bank, Xinhua Bank and its branches, Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, Juyu Cheng Bank, Siming Bank, China Commercial Savings Bank, Donglai Bank, East Asia Bank, Wing Hang Bank, Overseas Chinese Bank, Jiangsu Bank, China Agricultural and Industrial Bank, Zhongxing Bank, Jiangsu Farmers Bank, Zhonghui Bank, Silk Industry Bank, Hengli Bank, China Enterprise Bank, China National Encouragement Industry Bank, Shanghai Women's Commercial Savings Bank, Zhejiang Local Bank, Sichuan Meifeng Bank, Yongda Bank, Pudong Bank, Zhizhong Bank, Guangdong Bank, Zhengming Commercial Bank, Zhonghe Bank, China Trust Company, Shanghai Trust Company, Tongyi Trust Company, Zhongyi Trust Company, Fukang Money Shop, Tongrun Money Shop, Fuyuan Money Shop.</p>
<h3>Zhang Weishan and Others Promote "One Yuan Debt Repayment"; Chinese Employees of Jardine Matheson Also Enthusiastically Contribute</h3>
<p>Local magnates Zhang Weishan, Liu Junqing, Song Shouqing, and others believe that with the country in dire straits, all Chinese people should love their country and therefore promote the "One Yuan Contribution for Debt Repayment" to fulfill their civic duty. Currently, they have collected 2 yuan each from Zhang Weishan, Song Shouqing, Liu Junqing, and Li Yilian, and 1 yuan each from Li Hongsheng, Zhuang Ruheng, Liu Chunshu, Zhang Jinfu, Ma Anxiang, Liu Zhisheng, Jin Guanya, Yu Xianglin, Huang Yufu, Wang Yongjun, Wang Rulin, Xie Wanfang, and Mu Qinglan, totaling 21 yuan in national currency, which will be transferred by this newspaper to the Central Bank for remittance to Chongqing. Furthermore, Chinese employees of the British Jardine Matheson also enthusiastically contributed, raising a total of 281 yuan in national currency, which has been handed over by a representative of the real estate department of the company to the Central Bank for remittance to Chongqing. As this movement begins, accumulating sand into a tower and gathering fur into a robe, the number of contributions to the country will be even more impressive. Their enthusiasm and grand undertaking are truly admirable.</p>
<h3>Wang Yiting Memorial Service; Hometown Associations Join in Succession</h3>
<p>Various groups in the city, such as the Hu She, are preparing for the memorial service for elder Wang Yiting, which is scheduled to be held at 2:00 PM on the 15th of this month in the auditorium of the association on Guizhou Road. This has been reported in this newspaper. The latest developments are recorded below:</p>
<p>Participating Groups</p>
<p>In addition to the six groups that initiated the event, such as the Hu She, which have been reported in this newspaper, it is now known that the Wuxing County Chamber of Commerce, the Wuxing Branch of the Chinese Red Cross, the Wuxing Money Industry Guild, the Wuxing Crepe Vegetable Trade Association, the Wuxing Silk Weaving Industry Guild, the Wuxing Machine Weaving Industry Guild, the Wuxing Branch of the World Red Swastika Society, the Wuxing Branch of the Chinese Relief of Women and Children Association, the Wuxing Co-assistance Benevolent Society, the Wuxing Orphanage, the Huzhou-Jiaxing-Suzhou-Jiading Long-distance Bus Company, the Wuxing Electric Company, and twelve other groups have successively joined the event.</p>
<p>Issuing a Notice</p>
<p>The preparatory office of the memorial service has recently printed a notice and distributed it to various fellow villagers. The notice is excerpted as follows: "We are writing to inform you that Elder Wang Yiting, whose formal name is Zhen and who is also known as Bailong Shanren, lived in Wuxing, Zhejiang. When the Taiping Rebellion broke out, Mr. Wang followed his father to seek refuge in Zhoupu Town, which belonged to Shanghai County. He loved to read from a young age and dabbled in classics and history. However, his family was poor and unable to provide for his studies. At the age of sixteen, he was admitted to the Guangfangyan Institute of the Shanghai Manufacturing Bureau. He reviewed the old and learned the new, earning praise from the public. Soon after, he abandoned his studies and entered business, which was not his ambition. After his annual income became abundant, he devoted himself to painting. Initially, Mr. Wang's maternal grandfather, Jiang Ziweng, was famous for his paintings. His wife, Madam Zhao, once showed Mr. Wang the paintings she had collected and said, 'These are the works of your maternal grandfather.' Mr. Wang was delighted and spared no effort in studying and imitating them. He also spent time with Hu Gongshou, Pu Zuoying, Ren Bonian, Wu Cangshuo, and Reverend Xugu, and his artistic skills improved, and his reputation grew. At that time, the Qing government was corrupt, and the Shanghai gentry conspired to self-govern, recommending Mr. Wang as the Director of the Shanghai General Engineering Bureau, the President of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, and the President of the Shanghai County Chamber of Commerce. Local people were happy to associate with him, but Mr. Wang focused on industry, such as yarn, cloth, silk, matches, flour, ships, banks, water and electricity, and highways. He was regarded as a leader in all industries. When the revolutionary army rose up, Song Yufu, Chen Yingshi, Yu Youren, and others conspired to restore Shanghai, using Mr. Wang's strength to raise 910,000 gold to help with military expenses. When President Sun established the provisional government, Mr. Wang served as the Minister of Agriculture and Commerce and concurrently as the Minister of Transportation, but he soon resigned because of his ambitions. Mr. Wang was charitable by nature and devoted to his fellow villagers. In the late Qing Dynasty, he initiated the Huzhou Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association. The following year, he built the Huzhou Guild Hall with an affiliated convalescent villa. The year after that, he established the Huzhou Shanghai Public School. After the tenth year of the Republic, the Lang people founded the Hu She, and Mr. Wang strongly supported its establishment. Other organizations, such as the Wuxing Orphanage and the Women and Children Relief Association, all relied on Mr. Wang's planning. There was no limit to the welfare of his hometown. After the age of fifty, he lamented that the national crisis was becoming increasingly serious, and natural and man-made disasters were coming one after another. He made a grand vow to devote himself to charitable causes and convert to Buddhism to enjoy his later years. Therefore, he did good deeds regardless of size, and he rescued disasters regardless of territory. He cared for the elderly, cared for orphans, relieved poverty, and helped the suffering. He would act if he heard of it, and he would follow if he saw good. Although he was tired, he did not refuse. During the January 28th Incident, the war spread, and Mr. Wang was engaged in relief work day and night, and his physical and mental health deteriorated day by day. Mr. Wang has three sons and two daughters, all of whom persuaded him to recuperate elsewhere. Mr. Wang then lived in seclusion in another port. Unexpectedly, he passed away less than a year after leaving Shanghai and less than a day after returning to Shanghai. On the day of his death, the villagers reported the situation to the authorities, who issued a clear commendation. The memorial service for our fellow villager will be held at 2:00 PM on January 15th in the auditorium of the Hu She. All of our fellow villagers are requested to attend at that time to express our condolences together. If you would like to send a eulogy, please send it to the Hu She in advance for the memorial service preparatory office. We will be deeply grateful."</p>
<h3>Remittance Discount Unprecedentedly Low; Decision to Change the Issuance of Cash for the Redemption of Unified Public Bonds</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of the remittance bill system in Shanghai after the war, it has led to the trend of remittance discounts. Because it became increasingly severe, it led to the manipulation of speculators. The Silver and Money Industry Association once gathered to strictly restrict the withdrawal of remittances to maintain the normal state of finance, and the trend of discounts naturally disappeared. Later, due to practical difficulties, it was difficult to eliminate. Between August and September of this year, the remittance discount was manipulated by speculators, and the discount rate was as high as 70 yuan. Fortunately, it was leveled by the four banks and the bill exchange, and it fell back to about 50 yuan. Recently, due to the success of the Sino-US and Sino-British loans, and the financial stability of the year-long War of Resistance, the government changed the payment of cash for the redemption of unified public bonds, and the prices of bonds in the securities market soared, creating a new record after the war. General speculative trading of public bonds can be paid by remittance. Therefore, remittances have fallen again and again, and yesterday it has fallen to 28.5 yuan. As for the redemption and payment of interest on the five types of unified public bonds A, B, C, D, and E, it has been scheduled for the 31st of this month to be paid by the Central Bank and its entrusted Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Central Trust Bureau.</p>
<h3>German Engineer Goes to Chongming, Beaten by Japanese Thugs; Refuses to Accept the Property of the Yitai Foreign Firm; Has Reported to the German Consul General for Serious Negotiations</h3>
<p>The Modern News Agency reports that the Fuan Yarn Factory in Chongming was originally founded by Chinese businessmen, with complete scale and business. Since the outbreak of the war and the fall of Chongming Island, the factory has been shut down, and the factory site has been completely seized by the Japanese. They have repeatedly threatened and lured the factory to cooperate and restore operations, but without success. However, all the property of the factory was sold to the Yitai Foreign Firm in this port for US$140,000 before the war. Last week, in order to organize the factory's contents and prepare for startup, the Yitai Foreign Firm specially commissioned the general manager of the firm, a German engineer named Ackpoer, to take a boat to Chongming Island to take over the property. Unexpectedly, the Japanese refused and sent a large number of thugs to surround the house where Ackpoer was staying, and beat him severely. All kinds of documents, evidence, and passports that he had brought with him were looted and torn up. After Ackpoer was seriously injured, he was driven off the island. It is learned that Ackpoer has now returned to Shanghai in a mess. He has reported to the German Consulate in Shanghai, requesting serious negotiations. It is heard that the German Consulate considers this case to be serious and cannot be ignored. It is now investigating in detail in order to take effective measures.</p>
<h3>Consular Corps Prevents European Refugees from Coming to Shanghai; Relies on Gathering in Shanghai after Being Taken Back; Discusses Future Actions</h3>
<p>The English-language Great American Evening Post reports that several consuls of the Shanghai Consular Corps have decided to take action to prevent European political refugees from flocking into the two concessions, so that the entire Consular Corps will thoroughly study the refugee situation in this port. The Italian Consul General in Shanghai, Nilong, is currently on vacation in Japan. It is heard that after Nilong returns to Shanghai, when the first decision meeting of the Consular Corps is held, the issue of Jewish refugees will be discussed. It is said that there are currently no passport regulations implemented for immigrants or travelers coming to Shanghai. The Public Works Department has done everything it can to notify the Consular Corps and Jewish organizations in Shanghai and overseas of the problems encountered by the extremely poor refugees in Shanghai. Therefore, the Consular Corps has received a letter from the Public Works Department on the issue of Jewish refugees and will wait for Nilong to return to Shanghai before the consuls hold a general discussion to determine their actions.</p>

<h3>Discovery of the Coffin of Murdered Refugee Zhang Boyuan: The Exhumation Process Was Tortuous and Bizarre; The Burial Site Reveals Major Suspicions; The Criminal's Accomplices Are Numerous and Extremely Cunning; The Autopsy Report Has Not Yet Been Delivered</h3>
<p>Shen Zhiguang, the director of the Huazhen No. 42 Refugee Camp, which belongs to the Pudong Building Branch of the Shanghai Charity Organizations Federation, and the staff members Song Meixi, Cao Linsen, Cai Zuying, Zhao Weilian, etc., were arrested by Liu Shaokui, the chief Chinese detective of the Public Concession Police Headquarters, and detective Song Bingzheng, etc., for embezzling and selling refugees' food rations and for beating refugee Zhang Boyuan to death. They were interrogated and detained at the Special No. 1 Court. Later, the court and the police authorities, in order to ascertain the truth of the facts, decided to exhume the coffin for examination. On the 6th of this month, detectives Liu and Song went to the Puan Temporary Coffin Repository on Columbia Road. During the exhumation, the suspicious case of a black coffin turning into a white coffin and a male corpse being replaced by a female corpse occurred. The details have been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that Zhang Boyuan's coffin has been found by the Puan</p>
<p>Coffin Repository</p>
<p>and sent to the police station. The Special No. 1 Court appointed Prosecutor Song Genshan to examine it the day before yesterday. Because the external appearance could not be examined, it was specially ordered that forensic doctors Wei Ligong and Zhang Yan perform an autopsy. At 2:30 p.m. yesterday, Judge Feng Shide continued the trial of this case in the Criminal Court. The police lawyer Ru Baoyi stated that the</p>
<p>Forensic Report</p>
<p>had not yet been delivered, and the police could not know the details. However, regarding the change in the color of the coffin, the detectives in charge of the case reported to the court that although the defendants are still detained and cannot take any action, it proves that their accomplices are numerous and their evil influence is great. He requested the court to interrogate them. Detective Song Bingzheng then stated that according to the regulations of the Puan Coffin Repository, all coffins stored by bereaved families are buried, with a wooden sign hung on the coffin, stating the deceased's name, age, and place of origin.</p>
<p>After burial in the soil</p>
<p>another wooden sign is erected on the ground, stating who the buried coffin belongs to, so that there should be no mistakes when the family members come to claim it in the future. On the 6th of this month, I, together with representatives from the Charity Federation Branch and the Refugee Relief Association, as well as Zhang Boyuan's son Zhang Aiyi, went to exhume the coffin. Zhang Aiyi pointed out his father's burial site. The wooden sign on the ground did indeed state Zhang Boyuan, but after digging the soil, the sign on the coffin was Shen Huiyuan, 40 years old, from Shandong, and the coffin was white, not black. It was clearly</p>
<p>not Zhang Boyuan's</p>
<p>coffin without a doubt. Later, the staff of the repository pointed to a black coffin four or five coffins away from this coffin, saying that it was Zhang's coffin. However, the name on the wooden sign in front of the coffin was Xu Zhu's, and the coffin was also smaller than Zhang's coffin. Therefore, we ordered them to investigate and find it quickly. The coffin was sent to the police station the day before yesterday and identified by Zhang Aiyi as correct. Our investigation revealed that the location where the coffin was exhumed was more than ten coffins away from Zhang's original coffin location. We notified the</p>
<p>Director of Puan Repository</p>
<p>Zhang Deyu to come to the police station, but he has not yet arrived. This is the situation. Zhang Aiyi then stated that his late father's coffin was deposited at the Puan Coffin Repository on December 5th of last year. On the 8th, when I went to pay the insurance policy, the staff of the repository dug up the soil at my father's burial site and showed it to me. The coffin was correct, and the wooden signs on the coffin and outside the soil both had my father's name. However, when I went with the detectives on the 6th of this month, the wooden sign at the original location still had my father's name, but the coffin had been replaced by someone else's. Where Zhang's coffin was</p>
<p>found from then on</p>
<p>was unknown. The court then ordered the police to conduct a thorough investigation of this point to clarify the truth. After questioning the defendants in detail, it was already late in the evening. The court, believing that further investigation was necessary, announced a postponement of the trial and ordered the defendants to be returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Fourteen Local Silk Merchants Accused of Damaging Reputation by Publishing Slander Against the Zhenze Silk Industry Association; Both Lawyers Request Postponement of the Trial</h3>
<p>Shi Wenqing, Xu Ziwei, Sun Xuchu, etc., who have been engaged in the silk industry in Zhenze, Wujiang County, recently hired lawyer Chen Tingrui to file a complaint in the Criminal Court of the First Special Court, accusing Cheng Xingshu of Hengmao Silk Shop on Qipu Road, Tu Junru, Gong Baixin of Zhenda Silk Shop in Qianji Lane on Tianjin Road, Lu Songshan of Zhengfeng Silk Shop, Jiang Shaoqing and Shi Yangxian of Yongxing Silk Shop at No. 105 Wufu Lane on Tianjin Road, as well as Zhang Qingshi, Zhang Heqing, Dong Shuomin, Xu Tingqi, Wen Youzhang, Wu Ruiming, Zhu Rulin, Zhou Ziqing, and others, of spreading text to</p>
<p>damage their reputation.</p>
<p>The facts of the prosecution are that the establishment of the Zhenze Silk Industry Association was formed under special circumstances and was not initiated by anyone. However, on December 25th of last year, the defendants used the names of their represented or managed Yutong, Xieji, Zhencheng, Yuxing, Yilixiang, Zhengfeng, Zhentai, Fengji, and other firms to publish a large advertisement with large-character headlines in the Shen Bao and Wen Hui Bao, slandering the plaintiffs. The facts stated therein were</p>
<p>completely fabricated.</p>
<p>The Zhenze Silk Industry Association was organized when the industry was forced to do so. The plaintiffs' firms were also subject to the environment and paid fees. They were not people who took advantage of the opportunity to initiate and preside over the association. Now, the defendants claim that it was organized by the plaintiffs, and that Sun Xuchu was appointed as the chairman, Xu Ziwei as the head of the Shanghai office, and Shi Wenqing as the leader, and that they forced the industry to pay fees, which is completely fabricated. In August of this year, the industry transported silk</p>
<p>to Shanghai and it was detained.</p>
<p>A fee of 200 yuan per bale was paid to retrieve it. The plaintiffs' firms were all victims. Now, the defendants claim that the plaintiffs forced the industry to pay 200 yuan per bale in advance, which is also fabricated. Regarding the previously robbed silk, plaintiffs Shi Wenqing and Xu Ziwei did not say, "Unless you redeem it from us, there is no hope." The firms of plaintiffs Shi Wenqing and Xu Ziwei were all victims in the unredeemed portion. Now, the defendants claim that "Shi Wenqing and Xu Ziwei bought it at the lowest price and sold it at a high price, reaping huge profits in one transfer, harming the industry in the occupied area to the tune of 200,000 yuan. They live in the concession, enjoying a peaceful life and escaping the law," etc. The facts they point out are all fabricated, and the text they spread is extremely slanderous, enough to damage the reputation of the plaintiffs. In summary, the plaintiffs are all normal businessmen and believe they have a considerable position in the business world. However, the defendants are jealous of their peers and have other intentions, so they do not hesitate to fabricate facts and</p>
<p>slander them wantonly.</p>
<p>Therefore, they filed a lawsuit, requesting that they be punished according to the law and that the judgment be published in the newspaper to warn against illegal activities, etc. Yesterday morning, the Special Court summoned them. Because it was late, the plaintiff's lawyer Chen Tingrui and the defendant's representative, lawyer Qiu Hanping, agreed to request a postponement. Judge Zhong approved the postponement to the 17th for further hearing.</p>
<h3>Jardine Matheson's Hanwa Steamer Attacked by Pirates; British Warship Rushes to the Rescue Upon Receiving Distress Signal; Pirates Flee; People and Ships Are Safe</h3>
<p>According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury," Jardine Matheson's Hanwa steamer was attacked by pirates in the Yangtze River last night (the 9th). However, the captain of the ship sailed forward bravely amidst machine gun fire. The radio operator lay in the cabin and sent out an emergency call. Within fifty minutes, the British warship HMS Gannet arrived. But the pirates, seeing the warship arrive, fled into the darkness. The details are as follows: The Hanwa steamer was sailing from the towns near Jiangyin Shuizha back to Shanghai, towing</p>
<p>two tugboats.</p>
<p>At that time, there was also a Japanese tugboat towing a barge ahead of the Hanwa steamer. While navigating against the tide, the captain of the ship saw four sampans approaching the Japanese ship. The Japanese ship immediately released the towline, abandoning the barge and sailing away on its own. But the sampans turned and sailed, apparently because the pirates thought the British ship was carrying more valuable cargo, or they intended to rob the British ship first and then the Japanese ship's tugboat, so they sailed towards the Hanwa steamer. The captain of the ship, protected by steel plates, continued to sail bravely forward and called the radio operator to send</p>
<p>an emergency signal.</p>
<p>The British warship HMS Gannet received the signal and immediately rushed to the scene. The location was forty miles upstream from the Wusongkou. The first radio signal was sent at 4:00 p.m. Soon, the pirates opened fire on the Hanwa, trying to force it to sail towards the riverbank. At 4:50 p.m., the British warship arrived near the Hanwa, but the pirate ships had already</p>
<p>fled into the darkness.</p>
<p>No one was injured on the Hanwa steamer or the tugboats. Only one passenger later pointed to a hole in his hat and demanded compensation from Jardine Matheson for the "loss." Although it could not be confirmed that the hole was caused by a bullet, the company still compensated him two yuan and stated that it would not set a precedent.</p>
<h3>Jing'an Bathhouse Accountant Falsely Reports Robbery to Cover Embezzled Funds; Admits to the Crime Without Hesitation During Yesterday's Trial</h3>
<p>Yang Zhibiao, a native of Yuyao, 41 years old, was the accountant of the Jing'an Bathhouse at No. 3 Lane 71, West Jing'an Temple Road, Shanghai. Recently, because he had embezzled funds from the store and could not make up for it, he came up with a strange idea. On the afternoon of the 8th, at around 9:00 p.m., he used a knife to puncture the trousers of his right leg, slightly injuring the skin and flesh. Then, he reported to the French police station that he had been stopped by robbers on West Zilaihuo Street, who had robbed him of more than 420 yuan in cash and stabbed him in the right leg. He requested an investigation and arrest. The police chief approved his request and sent a detective to investigate West Zilaihuo Street, but no robbery had occurred. The detective repeatedly questioned Yang about the circumstances of the robbery. Yang stammered and finally revealed that he had embezzled funds from the store and made up a false report of robbery to cover up the truth. The detective reported to the police chief, who detained Yang. Yesterday afternoon, he was escorted to the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. The lawyer representing the police department, Lu, stated the case, saying that the defendant had embezzled funds from the accounting room due to business misappropriation and had made up a false report of robbery. He requested a postponement for further investigation and another trial. The defendant hired lawyer Xue Lisheng to defend him. Tang Yi, the owner of the Jing'an Bathhouse, also came to the court and stated the circumstances of the defendant's embezzlement of funds. Judge Miao Qingbang questioned the defendant, who admitted without hesitation that he had falsely reported the robbery. The court ordered a postponement to the 19th for further investigation and another trial. The defendant was taken into custody.</p>
<h3>Russian Man, Drunk, Breaks into Someone's Home; Detained at Police Station, Screams and Shouts; Sentenced to Seven Days of Detention by the Court</h3>
<p>Russian man Amik Shiloshi, 27 years old, lives at No. 332 Pushi Road. The day before yesterday, he was drunk due to excessive drinking. At around 8:00 p.m., he suddenly broke into the home of Wu Chen, a woman at No. 9 Ciqing Lane, Jiujiang Road. Without asking why, he took off his upper garment and lay down on her bed. Wu and others ordered him to leave, but A refused. Wu had no choice but to notify the Laozha Police Station by phone. Chinese detective Yang Chengcai and Western police officer Lin rushed to the scene and detained the Russian man at the police station, temporarily detaining him in the detention room. Unexpectedly, A became highly intoxicated and screamed and shouted in the detention room at around 9:00 p.m., and broke the door of the room with his fists and feet. Chinese and Western police officers then imprisoned him. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Fourth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Zhang Shizhu prosecuted him for destruction of property under Article 354 of the Criminal Code. Judge Zhong Qing questioned A, who also admitted that he was drunk. The court sentenced Amik Shiloshi to seven days of detention. If he wanted to pay a fine, he could do so at the rate of one yuan per day.</p>

<h3>Freight Transport at the North Station Today: Railway Staff and Tax Officials Engage in Serious Extortion; Unequal Freight Rates Have Ulterior Motives</h3>
<p>—Xia Qi</p>
<p>Since the occupied Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways allowed passengers and freight transport in addition to military transport, the North Railway Station, once a scene of broken walls and deathly silence, has become a little more lively.</p>
<p>In the past, the railway stations responsible for the important task of importing and exporting goods for the metropolis of Shanghai were the Mackenzie Road Station, the North Station, the Rihui Port Station, and the South Station. Now, the South Station is completely closed. Although there were rumors that the Mackenzie Road Station would be opened soon, it has not yet happened. The Rihui Port Station has some goods unloaded because of its convenient location on the Huangpu River, but nothing is being shipped out because it has not yet been permitted. Only the North Railway Station is relatively busy and lively. It has goods being shipped out and goods being shipped in.</p>
<p>The unloading of goods arriving at the North Station is generally not much different from the past, except that the unloaded goods have no warehouses to be stored in and must be piled up in the open air. Moreover, after the abolition of the "likin" tax, which the invaders once used as an excuse to criticize China for lacking organization and considered the most unreasonable tax, the tax collectors, who had been absent for several years, have now reappeared under the bayonets of the invaders, reaching out to demand money for every item.</p>
<p>The process of shipping goods out is by no means as simple and smooth as it used to be. If you want to ship goods out, you must first register several days in advance. After the person in charge of registration allows you to register, they will give you a "freight space certificate" the size of a bean curd, which specifies the date on which you are allowed to bring the goods to the North Station. You can only bring the goods there on the specified date. However, before that, you must take this "freight space certificate" to the person in charge of freight space and ask him to assign a space. At this time, if you only take a "freight space certificate," you will not get a space. You must attach five or ten yuan in legal tender to get what you want. After the person in charge of freight space allows you a space, they will write the number of the freight space on this "freight space certificate." Only then is the procedure complete, and you can take your goods to the assigned freight space to place them. If you do not get the permission of the person in charge of freight space, this "freight space certificate" issued at the time of registration is equal to waste paper. Not only will there be no space for you to pile up, but even the soldiers guarding the gate of the yard will not let you pass with the goods. - Before August 13th, the North Station often had many goods waiting to be transported piled up in the open air or on the roads outside the warehouse because there were too few warehouses. After the war, the few remaining warehouses were either destroyed or mostly unwilling to publicly store goods. Therefore, even if you spend a few dollars to buy a freight space, it is only an open space.</p>
<p>After the goods are piled up in the freight space, you have to request a car to load them. This also requires spending twenty or thirty yuan of inexplicable money. Otherwise, even if you leave them for a few days, no car will be assigned. The transfer companies run by Chinese people cannot directly request a car. They have to entrust it to a Japanese transportation company, or at least hire some Japanese people, which of course requires spending a lot of unjust money. Also, goods for export must have a "procurement permit," which most Chinese-run transfer companies have no way to obtain. They have to temporarily buy one from others for twenty or thirty yuan per car.</p>
<p>In the past, freight rates were divided into six levels in great detail. Now, they have been slightly changed to three levels. However, less-than-truckload shipments are not graded:</p>
<p>Silk, satin, general merchandise, etc. are first-class freight rates.</p>
<p>Rayon, cotton yarn, foreign cloth, native cloth, eggs, dried cocoons, flour, foreign candles, cigarettes, sugar, coal, iron... are second-class freight rates.</p>
<p>Cotton, wheat, soybeans, rice, salt... are third-class freight rates.</p>
<p>According to the above classification, we can clearly see its effect. The so-called third-class goods, which have the cheapest freight rates, are entirely China's major products and the things that the invaders most urgently need.</p>
<p>The current freight rate from Shanghai to Hangzhou for a second-class truckload is 2.55 Japanese yen per ton, to Nanjing 3.60 yen, Wuxi 2.60 yen, Suzhou 2.20 yen, Jiaxing 2.35 yen, Songjiang 2.30 yen, plus various fees for loading and unloading, etc., at 0.16 yen per ton for each type, totaling 0.64 yen. Also, the Tongyun Kabushiki Kaisha charges an additional 0.90 yen per ton for truckload shipments, regardless of distance, and 0.50 yen per load for less-than-truckload shipments. The so-called Tongyun Kabushiki Kaisha is the freight manager for the railway. It is responsible for the appointment and expenses of all freight personnel on the entire line.</p>
<p>All the vehicles loading goods on both lines were taken away when the Chinese army retreated to the west. The vehicles currently in use are small cars transported from other places, each with a capacity of 15 tons, but freight is charged based on 13 tons.</p>
<p>Because of the shortage of vehicles, because of the small size of the vehicles, there is an insufficient allocation. Because the transfer companies opened by Chinese people cannot directly request a car, because the purpose of some people is to make a fortune, there are many situations of extortion and exploitation, just like in other places. The "staff" in the station determine the price of their special fees based on the amount of goods and the number of vehicles each day. Many transportation companies or individuals of a certain nationality, relying on their natural convenience in obtaining vehicles, do not load their own goods - or have no goods to load at all - and transfer them to unfortunate Chinese people at a high price, just like subletting a house.</p>
<p>Currently, goods arriving at or departing from the North Station are subject to a 5% tax on the original price, which is collected by people sent by the puppet "Shanghai Municipality" stationed there. The clowns collecting taxes know nothing but extortion. Therefore, when estimating the price, they often arbitrarily inflate it. You cannot reason with them, as reason simply does not work there. However, this does not mean that they are "loyal to their duties." The situation is often like this: for example, if you have a batch of goods, they will estimate the original price at 3,000 yuan and the tax at 150 yuan. After agreeing, they will write a donation ticket for 50 yuan, collect 50 yuan from you, and tell you to contact someone in a certain place, which is often the Great Hotel or a hotel south of the Baidu Bridge. Sometimes, it may even be a brothel. If you go there at 8:00 or 9:00 in the evening, you would originally have to pay him 100 yuan, but because the money is going into his own pocket, he may offer a discount and only ask for 50 yuan.</p>
<p>If you want to know where their money goes, just look around in that place and you can see that they are smoking opium, gambling, drinking, and playing with women, everything is complete. The tax-collecting clowns and the Japanese staff on the railway are exactly the same. Not only do they embezzle the money for their own indulgence, but sometimes they even pull many employees of the transfer companies along with them, making noise until dawn, causing people to pay not only extra in terms of material things but also in terms of mental things.</p>
<p>Because the North Station is no longer dead, the houses damaged on Zhabei Road are also being rented out. The houses in this area are now considered confiscated, so during the concession period, you have to rent them from the "Japanese Resident Corps." The rent is about ten yuan or more per day, but what they give you is just a broken house that they do not repair. You have to repair it yourself. Therefore, someone rented a house and spent four or five hundred yuan repairing it. This kind of renting situation is truly rare.</p>
<p>The freight transport at the North Station is now relatively busy. At the same time, the pockets of certain people, as well as hotels, restaurants, brothels, opium dens, gambling houses, and liquor stores, are also busy. On the other hand, it is also the accelerated flow of the blood and sweat of the laborers.</p>
<h3>Woman Commits Adultery; Husband Requests Divorce; Jurisdiction Issue Resolved; Debate Concluded; Judgment Pending</h3>
<p>Zheng Yanling, 29 years old, a native of Ningbo and owner of Weishun Knitting Factory at No. 1 Shunchang Lane, Wangzhi Road, French Concession, married Zhao Lianying, a woman from the same hometown, who is the same age as Zheng. They have a daughter. The relationship was initially harmonious, but later Zheng discovered that Zhao was committing adultery with someone and wrote a letter of repentance without further investigation. However, in May of last year, Zhao again committed adultery with Cui Xiangshun, a peddler in the factory, and often went out on the pretext of meeting in a hotel. On October 12th, Zheng found a love letter from Cui to Zhao, reported it to the French police station, and Zhao was escorted to the Second Special Court, where she was prosecuted according to law. After the trial, Zhao was sentenced to</p>
<p>four months in prison.</p>
<p>Zhao refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the Third Branch Court. The appeal was rejected. She was allowed to commute the sentence to a fine of three yuan per day, and after being released on bail, she hired a lawyer to file a complaint in the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, accusing her husband Zheng Yanling of embezzling deposits, etc. The trial was not concluded. Details of these cases have been reported in previous newspapers. Now, Zheng Yanling, represented by lawyer Qian Zheng, filed a divorce lawsuit against Zhao Lianying (currently residing at the Hua'an Knitting Factory at No. 4, Lane 59, Huacheng Road) in the Civil Court of the First Special Court.</p>
<p>Divorce lawsuit.</p>
<p>Upon receiving the complaint, the court heard the case in Civil Court 7 yesterday morning, with Judge Li Liang presiding. The plaintiff and his representative, lawyer Qian Zheng, appeared in court and stated that the defendant had repeatedly committed adultery with others. After reporting to the police station, the defendant was escorted to the court for interrogation and sentenced to imprisonment. For the sake of the peace and safety of the family, the plaintiff filed a lawsuit according to law, requesting the court to grant a divorce. The defendant hired a lawyer to respond, requesting the court to reject the plaintiff's lawsuit and raising a jurisdiction issue, stating that the plaintiff's permanent address was in Ningbo and that Shanghai was only a temporary residence. It was argued that divorce cases should be</p>
<p>under the jurisdiction of the man's permanent residence.</p>
<p>The plaintiff claimed that although he was a native of Ningbo, he grew up in Shanghai and engaged in business, and did not often go to Ningbo. Regarding the facts of the case, our lawyer is still seeking clarification. Today, after being entrusted with the case, we only raised the point of requesting rejection and jurisdiction. After reviewing the situation, the court ordered the plaintiff's lawyer to present his arguments and then declared the debate concluded, setting the 14th for the verdict and adjourning the court.</p>
<h3>Gambling and Racketeering; Two Months of Imprisonment at Home; Gamblers Fined Ten Yuan Each</h3>
<p>Huang Yufu, a Chinese detective at the Yulin Road Police Station, learned at 2:30 p.m. the day before yesterday that someone was gathering to gamble and racketeer at No. 16, Lane 522, Huade Road, so he, along with a Western detective, rushed to arrest them. At that time, the room was full of gamblers, shouting and cheering excitedly, gambling in a so-called mahjong room. The detectives then began to arrest the owner, Xu Chunfang, Wu Mao'nan, and the gamblers Zai Jinsheng, Xiang Jinsheng, Feng A'jin, Yu A'rong, Chen Gende, Gong Shengcai, Wang A'man, Xu Yousheng, Jiang Shunde, Yu Guiquan, Wang A'zha, and others, totaling 36 people, along with the gambling paraphernalia and gambling money. They were taken to the police station and escorted to the Fourth Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Zhang Shizhu prosecuted them for gathering to gamble under Articles 266 and 268 of the Criminal Code. After questioning by Judge Zhong Qing, Xu Chunfang and Wu Mao'nan were each sentenced to two months of imprisonment. If they wanted to commute the sentence to a fine, they could do so at the rate of two yuan per day. The remaining 34 gamblers were each fined ten yuan. The gambling paraphernalia and gambling money were all confiscated as per the list.</p>

<h3>Russian Women's Nurse Accuses Credit Bank of Fraud, Defendant Denies Embezzlement and Counterclaims False Accusation, Case Not a Criminal Matter, Court Orders Review</h3>
<p>A Russian woman, A-bo-huo-ting-si-ka-ya (transliteration), residing at No. 7, Lane 51, Ge-xi-lu Road, represented by Russian lawyers Shu Sheng-min (transliteration) and Ai-pu-shi-tai-yin (transliteration), filed a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court. The complaint accuses Russians Mu-fu-wo-xi-bo-fu (transliteration, residing at No. 46, Lane 380, Gao-en Road), A-a-bi-te-luo-fu (transliteration, employed at the Asian Trust Company, No. 303, Mai-er-xi-ai Road), and Russian lawyer Si-yi-kuo Liu-si-min Chen-kuo (transliteration, residing at No. 2, Lane 373, Ya-er-pei Road) of fraud and embezzlement, requesting legal action.</p>
<p>The complaint states that the plaintiff obtained Certificate No. 868 issued on July 23, 1938, by the Liquidation Office of the Harbin Credit Bank, stating that she had deposited 2,256 yuan and 3 jiao in national currency until the bank's liquidation, and has only recovered 112 yuan, 3 jiao, and 1 fen to date. The plaintiff, a nurse, accumulated these savings through hard work and deposited them in the bank because of assurances from the first and second defendants that the bank was American and reputable, so she had no doubts. Only when the bank declared bankruptcy did she realize that it was not an American company, but an ordinary partnership, and the owners were the first and second defendants and the now-departed Ke-li-gai-er (transliteration), who opened the bank without any capital, using the credibility of a foreign flag for the purpose of committing crimes.</p>
<p>The plaintiff recently learned that the first and second defendants colluded with the lawyer who was the liquidator of the Shanghai branch of the Credit Bank, the third defendant, to obtain a large amount of funds that were illegally transferred from the Harbin bank to the Shanghai branch, disregarding the promise made by the third defendant to remit any remaining funds to Harbin after settling the Shanghai branch's debts, for distribution to Harbin depositors. The plaintiff believes that the defendants' actions constitute fraud, embezzlement, and professional embezzlement under Articles 339, 335, and 336, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the court, based on the complaint, held a hearing presided over by Judge Liao. The plaintiff and her lawyers appeared and testified to the previous circumstances. The first and second defendants, along with their defense lawyer Shen Di-guo-fu (transliteration), appeared and denied fraud and embezzlement, claiming that they were also victims as depositors and filed a counterclaim for false accusation. The third defendant stated that he was appointed as the liquidator of the Shanghai branch of the Credit Bank and the liquidation was not yet completed and denied collusion and embezzlement.</p>
<p>After reviewing the evidence, the court determined that the case involved civil matters and did not fall within the scope of criminal law, and ordered a review of the matter.</p>
<h3>Fire on Hankou Road</h3>
<p>At around 1:00 AM yesterday, a fire suddenly broke out at No. 660, Da Xin Tai Cotton Shop, behind the Great World Theater on Hankou Road in the International Settlement, spreading to No. 662, San Tai Paper Shop, next door. The cause of the fire was said to be carelessness in cooking. Smoke and flames quickly filled the air, and the light soared into the sky. After receiving the report, the fire brigade rushed to the scene and extinguished the fire after more than an hour. In addition to the complete destruction of the No. 660 cotton shop and the San Tai Paper Shop, the remaining buildings suffered slight water damage. Traffic in the surrounding areas, such as Guizhou Road and Guangxi Road intersection, was cut off, and only returned to normal after an hour.

<h3>Lu Lu-chen, Head of the Puppet Tax Bureau in Songjiang, Arrested</h3>
<p>When Zhang Shou-zhi, the puppet "county magistrate" of Songjiang, first took office, he appointed his confidants such as Lu Lu-chen to establish puppet "tax bureaus" in Desheng Port and other places, extorting huge amounts of taxes from merchants transporting goods. For several months, rumors circulated that Lu and others were making a fortune, which led to internal disputes. Zhang took the opportunity to transfer Lu to the puppet "county government" to serve as a "section chief," which caused Lu to harbor resentment. Taking advantage of the opportunity when Zhu Mou went to the puppet "provincial government" to attack Zhang Shou-zhi, Lu colluded with Zhu to completely expose Zhang's misdeeds. Lu, due to other matters, was uneasy in his position and fled to Shanghai, residing at the Chen Family Beach in the Xiaocai Court on Avenue Edward VII in the Public Concession, at the home of his relatives. After receiving a report, the General Patrol Room of the Public Concession sent Chinese and Western detectives to search Lu's hideout before dawn and arrested Lu Lu-chen, who was temporarily detained pending investigation.</p>
<h3>Zhang Hui-fang is Safe</h3>
<p>Zhang Hui-fang, the commander of the People's Self-Defense Corps Guerrilla in the Chuansha border area of Pudong, has one of the strongest forces among the Chuansha guerrilla units.

When the Japanese army advanced in force last month, his subordinates Yang Mei-ting and other major teams were once dispersed, but within a few days, they restored their original strongholds. Their actions are unpredictable, and the Japanese side hates them to the bone. Recently, Zhang took a boat to Shanghai on official business. Rumors suddenly spread that Zhang was shot and assassinated by thugs. According to news from Chuansha yesterday, the report of Zhang's assassination is not accurate. Zhang has safely returned to the defense area and was not discovered or injured during his journey.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Sympathy</h3>
<p>— A</p>
<p>"Sympathy" is a good-sounding noun.</p>
<p>However, in this century, "sympathy" should be deleted from the general dictionary. Because with the deletion of "sympathy," words such as "altruism," "humanity," and "mutual assistance" also seem to have no need to occupy a line in the dictionary. -- However, the word "mutual assistance" may sometimes have to be applied in the dictionary of murderers who slaughter humanity. But this is definitely not the "original meaning of mutual assistance" that can be related to "sympathy," etc.</p>
<p>From a historical point of view, there are many stories of giving clothing and food to the needy. Although it is impossible to determine the authenticity of these stories, passing them on to cultivate the "sympathy" of future generations is still slightly beneficial to the world and people's hearts.</p>
<p>However, in fact, the benefit of the dissemination of these stories to the world and people's hearts is also too small to mention. Ardent sympathy for refugees struggling on the line of death is certainly admirable, but the corruption case of selling refugee food has been exposed more than once or twice in the newspapers. Such "conscienceless" behavior is enough to make "sympathy" cry.</p>
<p>Recently, it is even more common to see those "philanthropists" sitting in cars and going to first-class restaurants to discuss the "righteous act" of rescuing refugees. And when the wine is drunk and the ears are hot, before the discussion is over, there are often people who recruit a few girls to drink, or recruit a few escorts to accompany them, to help the fun. And some gentlemen will actually inquire in detail about the life experiences of these fallen women, and reluctantly express sighing and sighing to show that they are full of sympathy. -- Although their eating, drinking, and playing are "undoubtedly out of their own pockets," it seems appropriate to transfer the funds for this eating, drinking, and playing to help the refugees, but the adults and gentlemen will not do it.</p>
<p>The business community promotes the one-hundredth-of-one promotion movement, but every small employee of every store is often struggling in the atmosphere of the terror of "layoffs." "If you lose your job, someone will save you." This is not humor, but somewhat serious. However, in fact, it is not entirely the case. Judging from the incidents of snatching wallets and demanding to eat Kung Si, although unemployed and unable to live, it is not easy to find sympathy without the performance of a tragic story.</p>
<p>The amount of the entertainment donation is surprisingly large. On the surface, the spirit of Shanghai people who "do not forget the refugees in entertainment" is worthy of praise. However, in this great era, they are still so drunk and dreamy. How can they show sympathy for the refugees on a small scale, and how can they show sympathy for the country and the nation on a large scale? The number of dedications that Shanghai people give to relief efforts, to the country, and to finding entertainment and stimulation each month should be listed and expressed statistically to test whether Shanghai people's sympathy is placed in refugees, the country, or selfish enjoyment.</p>
<p>The one-bowl-of-rice movement is the greatest expression of sympathy shown by mankind in the modern world, but on the one hand, the one-bowl-of-rice movement is promoted, and on the other hand, a large amount of military fire is sold to the aggressors to slaughter the people they sympathize with. This kind of sympathy is a bit ridiculously passive.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, there were ten rich men who saw the displaced girls as pitiful, so, based on human sympathy, they took them to their homes one by one to provide them with food and clothing. As a result, these girls all became the rich man's concubines. The modern so-called "sympathy," "altruism," at the lowest limit, there are always a few percent that are typical of this story, although their nature and method may be different.</p>
<p>Therefore, nouns such as "sympathy" should be deleted from the modern dictionary. At the very least, its original definition should be changed to make it more realistic.</p>
<h3>Sharpening the Knife</h3>
<p>— Wu Yi</p>
<p>The night is desolate, and the night in a fallen homeland is even more desolate, as if it were dead. I gritted my teeth, enduring the chill from the northwest wind that crept through the window cracks, quietly holding the tattered quilt prepared for me by the nanny and panting.</p>
<p>In the darkness, I heard the long, mournful rhythm of the howling wind and ghostly cries. I saw the will-o'-the-wisps rising and falling among the rubble of the West Village. Ten thousand terrors assailed me. I vaguely felt as if I had stepped into a world of demons. It truly was a world of demons!</p>
<p>"Hu, hu, sha..." A resentful voice clearly came from the black beast squatting on the edge of West Village—the burnt-out empty thatched hut.</p>
<p>"There's a ghost!" I cried out in surprise, shrinking into the tattered cotton quilt.</p>
<p>"It's not a ghost," the nanny said, "but lately, these empty houses often make this kind of sound. The young men in the village were either killed or wounded when the Red Soldiers came; those who could escape have escaped. None of the old ones dare to go near to see what's going on!"</p>
<p>My fear turned to doubt, doubt to contemplation, and I began to seek a reasonable solution for the safety of the villagers. So, I first pretended to be fast asleep in silence, and then, while the nanny was dozing off and mumbling in her sleep, I slipped out through the wooden door.</p>
<p>After staggering drunkenly, stepping over rubble and debris, I was blown stiff by the piercing wind among the hemp stalks about thirty paces from that thatched hut. Here, my eardrums were excited by a clangorous sound, which had changed from 'sha-hu' to a clear ring. I realized it was the sound of sharpening a weapon.</p>
<p>"Stop!" someone shouted in front of me.</p>
<p>After my eyes were blurred by the flashing of an electric light, I managed to regain my composure and recognize the man pointing a pistol at my chest.</p>
<p>"Ah! Donglin, is that you? When did you come back?" The man suddenly lowered his gun, grabbed my hand, and shook it.</p>
<p>"Um, Jin of West Village, are you still..."</p>
<p>I recognized him as Jin of West Village, but West Village had been burned by the Red Soldiers, and Jin had disappeared long ago. Some people suspected he was dead. But wasn't it him standing in front of me now? And why was he holding a pistol, guarding the road at night?</p>
<p>"Donglin, don't be alarmed, it's me, A Jin, I'm still alive. Although the enemy burned my home, they didn't manage to kill my young life, leaving me the opportunity to wash away the blood debts in my life history."</p>
<p>He took a long, excited breath and continued,</p>
<p>"Lately, I no longer grieve over the destruction of my home. From it, I have gained a more precious treasure, and that is a broadsword on my back and this pistol. I believe they will carve out a treasure in my life—a flame in my heart."</p>
<p>As he spoke, he reached out and patted my shoulder warmly.</p>
<p>"I believe you, I completely believe you," I said, moved and ashamed.</p>
<p>Then, Jin told me that the ominous house on the edge of the village, which no one lived in, was now the dormitory for their squad. Not a dormitory, but a place for group work. During the day, they went to the brigade headquarters and the town where the enemy was stationed to gather information, and at night, they gathered and rested here. However, for the sake of prudence, their actions were still being kept secret for the time being.</p>
<p>Jin pulled me to go and see the thatched hut that was their office or resting place. Naturally, lacking practical work experience, I was very willing to go, especially as the friendship between young people attracted me.</p>
<p>When we walked into that thatched hut, under the faint, flickering candlelight, I saw faces shining one by one. They had all suffered the greatest hardships in the enemy's brutality, making them even more happy and satisfied with their current passionate work.</p>
<p>There were about ten of them in total, most of them rolling up their sleeves to reveal bulging muscles, sharpening their broadswords. "Sharpening the broadswords to kill the devils!" I felt as if I had just woken up from a dream.</p>
<p>It seemed that Jin was the leader of this squad. After he briefly introduced me, two men ran up and shook my hand tightly. They were childhood companions from West Village, who had graduated from the S Town junior high school. Now, we were partners on the same front. "Clang, clang, clang," the sound of sharpening broadswords resonated again in the small thatched hut. The sound was loud and clear, bursting forth powerfully from the owners who were barely suppressing it.</p>
<p>"Where did all these knives come from?" Most of them were taken from the bodies of those who had died earlier, and some were donated to the brigade by the people. As for the few firearms that were not enough to distribute, they were the rewards that the enemy presented for our hard work."</p>
<p>Then I understood the reason for their secret actions: it turned out that for the sake of the safety of the broadswords, there were indeed a shocking number of traitors in our country, no wonder they had to be extra cautious. Perhaps the reason why this team was temporarily putting off expanding its organization was right here.</p>
<p>"I'll help you sharpen one too." I also picked up a knife and squatted down next to a whetstone, and what I recalled was the feeling of sharpening grass knives as a child.</p>
<p>"Clang, clang, clang," the sound of sharpening knives in the house became louder, our combined sound drowning out the howling west wind outside.</p>
<p>In this way, I spent a night back in my hometown in a rush of enthusiasm. Looking back, there were a thousand kinds of sweetness and warmth in my throat. Then I suddenly realized that my hometown was still always in spring, growing in the breath of spring; although this growth was new, it was vastly different from the old, lingering life of the past.</p>
<h3>I Love the Firelight</h3>
<p>— Luo Xi</p>
<p>I love how the wildfire can unleash ten thousand feet of light in the darkness, it can illuminate; who is the real human, who is the jackal in human form!</p>
<p>Although fire can burn down prosperous cities, although fire can burn down beautiful mountain villages; but this is the alternation of the new and the old, not a permanent disaster!</p>
<p>Man-eating jackals will run everywhere, and the light of wildfires will surge everywhere; no one has a place to escape, to hide!</p>
<p>On the burned ground, millions upon millions of oppressed children are singing in unison facing the soaring firelight;</p>
<p>"Only resistance, then liberation! Our will is a strong outpost; our fists are unparalleled knives and guns!"</p>
<p>Towards the ferocious jackals, millions upon millions of people have merged into a monstrous wave. They will crush the jackals beneath a mountain of bones, they will soak the dregs into an ocean formed of hot blood; after the wildfire subsides, they will build more prosperous cities on the land stained with blood and flesh; create more beautiful mountain villages!</p>
<p>Yes, I love the firelight!</p>
<h3>Half a Fried Dough Stick</h3>
<p>— Yu Lin</p>
<p>Living the remaining days of Chu under the threats and surveillance of the fierce and barbaric enemy's guns, fists, and clubs. Life and death depend on their whim; pleading only invites a beating. The body is already exhausted, so forced to temporarily abandon danger, family affection, spousal love, and hope all together, and take a nap. But the brain cannot allow you to rest, scene after scene of past events are being replayed.</p>
<p>Ah! The school is closed, old friends, teachers, have gone inland, and several magazines have been suspended due to the war, and there are only a little over ten dollars left, what to do? I watched my wife with tears in her eyes, and our two children were still sharing a bag of thirty-wen fried soybeans to eat. My wife endured the pain, smiled through her tears, patted her pocket, and said forward, "What's the use of keeping the ring? Exchange it! Gold is very expensive, today I heard it's one hundred and fifty-four yuan, compare it, and you can still earn more than half!"</p>
<p>The end of the month came, the ring paid seventeen of the rent; the manuscript of forcibly collected information was mostly returned, and my wife said let's become refugees! Anyway, the Li family and the Zhang family are there, what's there to be embarrassed about, the long-term method is still this good. Alas! I thought in my heart; what can be done if you're afraid of embarrassment! With the introduction of a good friend, my wife's advice was realized. Again encountering unexpected uses, the money is almost spent.</p>
<p>Soybean rice, with a lot of gravel, the older child is slightly aware, with no vegetables, only eats a little less, the younger child cries and can't swallow, the wife has no choice but to take out a fen, to buy a fried dough stick, store half of it, for the evening meal, cut half of it, into small pieces, mixed with soy sauce, soaked in boiled water, pick out the beans from the rice, one spoonful, one bean, feeding the younger child, saying, "Dad will get paid a few days later, buy half a catty of fried soybeans, you and your brother can eat for another week." After eating, a few spoonfuls of leftover food, the wife said to me: "Er Liang is not full, you can have some more, the soup may have a strange taste too."</p>
<p>The wife gave me the rice, and ate it with the soup, the oil flower "dough stick" crumbs, indeed have a different aroma! In the end, unable to bear to eat it alone, left two spoonfuls to feed the wife, the wife refused, the two played around, looked at each other, after a while tears each fell, the remaining food could not be swallowed!</p>
<p>Waking up in surprise, tears soaking the tattered quilt, neck hurting, regretting very much thinking to say: "What's the benefit of sadness? Only harms the body!" Turning over and over to fall asleep.</p>
<p>The environment is at Jiaotong University in West Shanghai, the refugees are more than fifteen thousand people, the rice cannot be cooked because the new pot has not arrived; having no choice but to buy as many pancakes as possible, five hundred workers, listen to my instructions, to distribute the pancakes to the brethren; one hundred staff, gather at the general office, under my control, cooperate and divide the work.</p>
<p>The time to eat has come, I said to everyone; "I'm very sorry, the new pot has not been bought, the rice cannot be cooked, the director said each person eats a bowl of noodles, and gets a fried dough stick."</p>
<p>Everyone ate noodles and bit into the fried dough stick, I said the noodles are already very delicious, the fried dough stick seems unnecessary, so I kept the fried dough stick, and gave it to a worker to take to my wife.</p>
<p>Late at night, after finishing the official business, returning to the wife's room, the wife asked me if I had eaten the evening meal, I said I had already eaten, the wife said: "We have already eaten the pancakes, the fried dough stick just now, I prepared it for you to eat with the pancakes when you came back, so I left half of it for you to eat. Fried dough sticks don't taste good overnight, let's share it!"</p>
<p>So, half a fried dough stick, half for each person, because full, not wanting to eat much, the wife also said: "Eating it like this for nothing now, thinking about the past troubles of having no vegetables to go with the soybean rice is sad enough!"</p>
<p>The dream woke up again, biting in the mouth there was no fried dough stick, not having had rice for three days, belly hungry, thinking of fried dough stick, even harder to endure.</p>
<h3>Ballad of the Blind Man</h3>
<p>— Sha Long</p>
<p>Who has ever appreciated my fingers plucking mournful sounds on the strings,</p>
<p>And who has ever appreciated my mournful sounds and granted me compassion?</p>
<p>The world is so cruel,</p>
<p>Where can I find my comfort,</p>
<p>To caress my wounded soul?</p>
<p>Who has a mouth to tell of my bumpy life?</p>
<p>Who has a heart to understand my unspoken feelings?</p>
<p>Like a crow perched on a withered branch in the depths of winter,</p>
<p>East, west, south, north, I have lost all reliance!</p>
<p>A blind man living in the world is the most unfortunate,</p>
<p>Just because I am blind, I can’t die!</p>
<p>No, I will pluck the strings of the instrument endlessly,</p>
<p>To pour out injustice for the unfortunate.</p>

<h3>Securities and Government Bonds Experienced Two Fluctuations; Few New Transactions; Limited Changes in Foreign Debt</h3>
<p>The unofficial market for securities experienced significant fluctuations yesterday, with market prices changing by as much as one yuan in either direction in an instant. This is unusual given the narrow scope of the spot market. Although prices generally declined from their highs, careful observation reveals no connection to the broader environment, with fluctuations driven entirely by speculative activity. Sellers were primarily long positions exiting the market, while buyers were short positions covering their positions. New transaction volume was limited, with more buying than selling. Given the current environment of controlled gold, abundant speculative capital, and increasingly concrete calls for international sanctions, government bonds enjoy excellent protection, and their future prices are therefore likely to rise. These temporary fluctuations are insignificant. Demand from small investors was strongest at the opening of the morning session, with Class A bonds reaching a new high of $63.60. Other bonds also stood at their previous day's peak. Following sales of the 11th and Xie Da bonds, long positions temporarily withdrew, and prices fell by six or seven cents. The 11th bonds then resumed buying. The Lian He bonds and small investors traded frequently, and prices rose again, nearly matching the morning's high. Later, the Tong Kang bonds and small investors sold at the high, and prices fell again. Class C and Class E bonds experienced the greatest price differences. Trading was active and lively, and the future appears promising. In the end, Class A bonds rose by 1.5 cents, while other bonds rose by 0.1 to 0.3 cents. Total transaction volume was approximately one million yuan. A summary table is provided below:</p>
<p>| Bond Type | High     | Low     | Closing    | Change from Previous Day |</p>
<p>| --------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | ------------------------ |</p>
<p>| Class A  | $63.60  | $63.30  | $63.50  | Up $0.15                 |</p>
<p>| Class B  | $56.80  | $56.10  | $56.20  | Down $0.10               |</p>
<p>| Class C  | $55.35  | $54.30  | $54.50  | Up $0.20                 |</p>
<p>| Class D  | $54.10  | $53.50  | $54.50  | Up $0.20                 |</p>
<p>| Class E  | $54.30  | $53.40  | $53.40  | Up $0.30                 |</p>
<p>| 96 Bonds | $7.15   | $7.00   | $7.00   | Up $0.10                 |</p>
<p>There were no transactions in stock market. Buyers of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange shares were offering 26 yuan, but there were still no sellers on the market.</p>
<p>London Chinese Foreign Debt: The listed prices on the 9th of this month (Monday) changed very little. Only the Hukwang Railway bond, without the German-issued coupon, rose one pound to 24 pounds. In addition, the Crisp bond fell half a pound to 36.5 pounds. Both returned to their prices from the previous week. In yesterday's market, the Longhai Railway bond was traded, with a transaction price of 13 pounds, which was one pound lower than the market. In addition, 2,500 pounds of the Sino-French US dollar bond with the coupon was transacted (i.e., US$10,000) at a price of 77 pounds, which was one pound higher than the market. The supply of physical bonds was limited to the railway bonds, including 2,000 pounds of the non-winning tickets of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway bond, priced at 25 pounds, and 1,000 pounds of the winning tickets, priced at 24.5 pounds, which was one pound and half a pound higher than the market. In addition, 2,500 pounds of the Hukwang Railway bond without the German-issued coupon was priced at 25 pounds, which was one pound higher than the market. In addition, 2,500 pounds of the winning tickets was priced at 23 pounds and 15 shillings, which was slightly lower than the market by five shillings. The market price of the British Gold Rehabilitation Bond was 40 pounds for the German-issued coupon and 48 pounds for the German-issued coupon. However, buyers were offering 48 pounds and 5 shillings to purchase it.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: A Tempestuous Situation; Cotton Yarn Experiences Sharp Rises and Falls; Early Morning, the Financial Community Collected and People's Hearts Were Boisterous; Afterwards, Due to Speculators Closing Positions, a Decline Began Suddenly</h3>
<p>After rising for five consecutive days, the yarn market suddenly exhibited a pattern of rapid advances and retreats yesterday. The market opened with strong gains, and the financial community dragged in 100 bales of Double Horse 20s cotton yarn at 402 yuan per piece, breaking through the big mark. Special Golden City 20s cotton yarn shot to 408 yuan. At this time, the market was full of excitement. Unexpectedly, due to the excessive price increase, buyers were hesitant, and a reaction began to occur. As general speculators who had profited saw that the rising trend had weakened, they rushed to release their positions, and the market suddenly changed, with a decline beginning suddenly. Prices fell across the board. Double Horse 20s closed at 391 yuan, a fall of 12 yuan compared to the opening price. This decline was within expectations and was not surprising. Since the market opened on a positive note, Double Horse 20s cotton yarn, compared to the year-end price last year, had already risen by 44 yuan. A decline of 20 yuan cannot be said to be too much, as it is the result of consecutive days of rapid gains. The morning market saw a continuation of the previous day's momentum, with a certain bank again buying, leading to a sharp rise. Opening prices were increased by as much as 7 or 8 yuan. Subsequently, demand from actual users was slightly sluggish due to the high prices, and at the same time, long positions exited the market, resulting in a sudden decline. However, the market recovered slightly at the close. Generally speaking, advances and retreats depend on actual consumption. The total trading volume in the morning was 1,025 bales, with fellow traders accounting for about half of the volume. The closing price of Double Horse 20s cotton yarn fell by 3 yuan compared to the previous day, Double Globe fell by 1 yuan, Special Golden City and Heavenly Girl fell by 2 yuan, while 16s and 10s cotton yarn remained relatively flat. Factories remained quiet. Exports totaled 310 pieces, which were shipped to Shantou, and 5 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong. The volume purchased by each group is recorded below:</p>
<p>| Group         | Volume | Group     | Volume |</p>
<p>| ------------- | ------ | --------- | ------ |</p>
<p>| Fellow Traders | 655    | Wenzhou  | 105    |</p>
<p>| Shantou       | 130    | Yunnan    | 110    |</p>
<p>| Sichuan      | 30     | Ningbo    | 5      |</p>
<p>| Total         | 1,025  |          |        |</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market was affected by the sharp rise in Chinese yarn, and prices rose by 3 to 4 yuan. However, as Chinese yarn retreated, Japanese yarn also tracked the decline. The closing price of Mizuyoshi 20s spot was 313 yuan, the initial traded price was 317.5 yuan. The current yarn price for Blue Phoenix 20s was 314.5 yuan, and then re-traded at 310 yuan.</p>
<h3>High Prices for "Ignition Flower" Cotton Appear Endlessly; 67 Yuan Exchange Rate; Foreign Cotton Transactions Remain Lively</h3>
<p>The cotton business has turned quieter, and the demand for fine cotton has become increasingly scarce. The translated price of foreign cotton has not only failed to rise but has weakened. The American and Indian cotton markets remained dull yesterday, and Japanese factories were very reluctant to purchase. It is because the purchase price of foreign cotton is low, and the quota can be large. Therefore, in recent days, the amount of foreign cotton ordered by Chinese and Japanese factories has been increasing day by day. The transaction of raw materials for 32-count fine yarn is as rare as a phoenix feather. As for the Chinese factories' willingness to adopt foreign cotton is extremely unwilling, but in this environment, it is also necessary to purchase and remedy.</p>
<p>The foreign cotton market, the New York market, due to the uncertainty of Washington news, all industries are holding a wait-and-see attitude. Yesterday, due to the fall in securities prices, the selling of foreign cotton merchants and the closing of long positions, the price showed a tired phase. As a result, the price of American cotton rose by 12 pounds of sound, and the Indian cotton was predicted to be not much different. Egyptian cotton fell sharply by more than 40 pounds of sound. Yesterday's exchange rate was flat, and the legal currency of American cotton, Brazilian cotton, and Indian cotton all fell by six or seven cents per load, while Egyptian cotton fell sharply by more than three yuan per load. Although foreign cotton transactions in this city are still lively, they are not as prosperous as the previous days. Yesterday, the selling price of "Ignition Flower" cotton was 67 yuan, equivalent to 64 yuan in cash. The quality of Indian cotton Pingguoer is better than "Ignition Flower," and there is a water foot rebate of about 50 cents per load that can be returned in the future. This kind of Indian cotton has been traded in large quantities on the market, and the cost to the factory is only 61 or 2 yuan. Therefore, the future of "Ignition Flower" and Yao Flower is very bleak. The situation of Tongzhou American cotton is even more difficult. The amount of transactions and the current goods are listed below:</p>
<p>The British-owned Jardine Matheson, Yixie, Yangshupu, and Three Factories opened a total of only 600 bales of 32-count Samsung, 20-count Shepherd, 20-count Samsung, and 6-count Rouge Tiger yarns. The quantity is very fresh, and all will be cleared in the first month.</p>
<p>There is no way but to resist the white-bagged flower in a certain sphere of influence with no appropriate method of resistance, the selling price continued to grow increasing, recent "Ignition Flower" cotton new highs need to be taken over by most of the Chinese factories, and the trading house absorption is also not bad, and the source from Subei has been called not thin, and the Tongzhou flower cotton had 1,789 bales, no opened price has been heard, and the Fu Nian Tuo Port came with 229 pieces, and Bei Sha came with 40 pieces. Yesterday's exported cotton was 140 pieces transported to Hong Kong. The current transaction quantity of cotton and the market conditions are listed on the left.</p>
<h3>Finance: Chinese and Westerners Compete to Settle Foreign Exchange; British and American Exchange Rates Have Shown a Decline; The US Dollar is Softer than the British</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market yesterday saw the Mobil Oil company, foreign firm and yarn and cotton merchants competing to settle their accounts, coupled with a light selling attitude from banks, causing the situation to tighten slightly. However, after settling, the US dollar was softer than the British pound, which was due to a decline in the British pound's appreciation rate. Hong Kong telegrams were settled after an initial surge, while Sassoon and the money exchange industry had selling intentions. There were no special changes on the day, and transactions were quite lively.</p>
<p>In the early morning, the London major and New York prices were unchanged, the London raw gold also fell by 2 bits, the exchange rate of British pound to US dollar was small 3 li 8, to French franc was down 25 cents, and to Shanghai was flat; US dollar to British pound was reduced by 1 point, to French franc down 25 cents, to Shanghai up 1 cent. The central listing of various foreign exchange were stagnant as before. Banks opened early, the spot selling price for British exchange was 8 bits 484375, and the US exchange was 16 and a half yuan, compared to the previous close, the British was flat and the US was tight 03125. After opening, due to Hong Kong telegram settling, the British gold was 8 bits 46875, which caused a settling wind, and the banks were unable to supply, causing the situation to soften. The HSBC listed price and the silver balance tax announcement did not move. Thereafter, foreign firms and British and American tobacco companies suddenly surged in settling payments, and the banks were unwilling to sell cheaply, so the market situation became tighter. The British gold was 8 bits 4375, and the US dollar was 16 yuan 40625. At noon, there were few transactions, only the money exchange industry repeatedly threw Hong Kong exchange without end, so the situation was slightly flat, the Hong Kong exchange hardened to 57 yuan 125. The noon closing price for British gold was 8 bits 46875, and the US dollar was 16 yuan 46875, (a certain bank had selling intention at 6 and a half yuan).</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the yarn and cotton merchants and foreign firms continued to absorb, and the bank's selling appetite remained light, causing the situation to tighten again. The British gold was 8 bits 46875, and it was once difficult to settle, softening to the interbank price. Later, because Hong Kong telegrams and Western merchant Sassoon and others suddenly turned eager to sell, and because the bank's absorption appetite was not good, the supply situation gradually became prosperous, and the money exchange industry came to spit out Hong Kong exchange again, so the process became cow-like, and the Hong Kong exchange once again hardened to 57 yuan 125, and then returned to 57 yuan. The evening closing selling price for British exchange was 8 bits 46875, and the US dollar was 16 yuan 46875, which was the same as the noon closing price. As a result, compared to the previous close, the British was tight 015625 and the US was soft 0625. The day's trading is recorded below.</p>
<h3>With a Large Number of Guest Merchants Searching for Purchases, Refined Bare Gold Rises Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash refined bare unofficial market conditions, the range of change is increasingly narrow, with only a four-yuan difference throughout the day, but in the middle, a certain money exchange industry once bought a large number of gods on behalf of the guest merchants. Fortunately, the silver building help's supply intention was still good, resulting in fresh changes, but the price ultimately became slightly stronger due to the softening of foreign exchange. Transactions were still prosperous in the early morning, but later, most showed a wait-and-see attitude, and then turned weak.</p>
<h3>Cash Transfers to Rise Four Yuan</h3>
<p>Since the early morning, each bar (ten taels), the initial opening due to a certain money exchange industry's intention to enter was quite strong, so the morning opening was immediately picked up to 1,988 yuan, and then a certain money exchange industry entered gold number one hundred taels, since then the silver building help's selling intention was also strong, resulting in a downturn, the silver building help sold to a certain money exchange industry fifty taels, price eighty-six yuan, (I heard that most of it was on behalf of the South China guest merchants) not long after the gold number vomited, suddenly came to re-enter fifty taels, price eighty-five yuan, all supplied by the silver building help, during which foreign exchange was slightly soft, so it repeated rising, the silver building help sold to the money exchange industry fifty taels, price eighty-six yuan, the gold number also came to re-enter the silver building help fifty taels, price eighty-six yuan five corners, and the money exchange industry fifty taels, price eighty-seven yuan, and finally the money exchange industry sold to the silver building help fifty taels, price eighty-eight yuan, for the noon closing price, in the afternoon the foreign exchange was stagnant and constant, so the market situation was idle, so few opened transactions were made, and until four o'clock there were still no trades, so the evening closing price was still made at 1,989 yuan, which was four yuan higher than the previous day, the cash number's own brand gold selling price was 1,995 yuan, and the receiving price was 1,980 yuan, and the current marked gold was about fifty yuan lower than the listed gold.</p>
<h3>Ornament Gold Returns to Rise One Yuan</h3>
<p>The silver building's jewelry gold was initially not changed for each ounce until noon, due to the firmness of the refined, so the consensus was to hang a big yuan, Da Tong Hang, Lao Qingyun, and others hung 202 yuan, Xin Tong Hang county 200 yuan, and the receiving was 194 yuan.</p>
<h3>Gold Price Decline Gradually Slows</h3>
<p>London, 9th - The decline in the price of English pure gold has slowed, mainly due to the strengthening and subsequent weakening of the English exchange rate. The price continued to fall by two pence per ounce, reaching £7, 8 shillings, 7 and a half pence. The central bank's buying price for Chinese pure gold (i.e., cash) also fell to 1,213 yuan and 3 jiao. The customs gold price also continued to fall by 5 li, totaling 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 6 li. The Shanghai standard gold price also continued to decrease by 1 yuan and 3 jiao, totaling 1,208 yuan and 6 jiao.</p>
<h3>Demand Still Drives Japanese Gold Note Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of English pure gold continued to fall by two pence. The exchange rate between British and American currencies fell back by one cent. The supply of foreign exchange was not strong, demand was slightly weak, and the trend was weak. There was considerable eagerness to acquire silver ingots.

Secondary white sugar from the Jian gang was priced at 18 yuan and 3 jiao, and top-grade white sugar at 22 yuan and a half. Jian Jian rock sugar has not arrived for a long time. According to inquiries from Gulangyu customers, large-sized rock sugar has already been produced and may be shipped to Shanghai soon.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods - Lake Lotus Arrives Continuously - Asking Price Increased by 10 Yuan, No Transaction</h3>
<p>Previously, due to the shortage of Chaozhou lotus seeds, the market price had reached 30 yuan, but it quickly sold out. Yesterday, according to market sources, a new batch has arrived. Due to higher costs and increased freight charges, the cargo owners were reluctant to sell immediately, asking for 40 yuan. It is said that a deal might be possible at 35 yuan.</p>
<h3>Grain - Japanese Merchants Massively Purchase Changshu Rice - 60,000 Bags Exported from Hupu - Shanghai Rice Source Causes Concern</h3>
<p>Although the source of national rice has been abundant recently, it has been heard that Japanese are actively purchasing in areas such as Changshu and Wuxi in the interior, reaching over 100,000 bags. Yesterday, 60,000 bags were loaded onto the Renhe ship and exported from Hupu. If this situation continues, it will inevitably affect the source of grain for Shanghai. Yesterday, only six or seven ships of Hetian goods arrived in port, with over 10,000 bags of chelun baozi. Sales slowed down, and the local market was inactive. Stockpilers took the opportunity to flood the market, so the situation was initially chaotic and then weakened. As a result, thick japonica rice decreased by several fen to one jiao, and thin indica rice also struggled to maintain its position, following the decline by several fen. Duyang Jian and Bu Jian all showed softness, with the original price being high. Stockpilers released their holdings, but sales were sluggish, and the price fell by one jiao.</p>
<h3>Flour Sales Begin - Wheat Price Stabilizes</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot flour market remained stable, but retail sales were slightly more active than before. Retail sales of Beiyang gang Qinhuangdao and Tianjin gang were not weak. Purchases from areas such as Shantou in the Nanyang gang also showed vitality. In the overall market, No. 2 flour was still the most traded. The current inventory of No. 3 and lower grades of flour is scarce, and factories are not supplying them, so transactions have also stagnated. In total, about 40,000 bags of Che Chuan brand, Tianzhu, and Yu flour were sold. Apart from the 8,000 to 9,000 bags for local retail sales, the rest was handled equally by the North and South gangs. The prices of all goods were consistently stable. Today, 2,000 bags of spot flour will be shipped to Shantou.</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market also turned stable. Regarding the source, several batches of new Jiangbei Puzhen and Yangzhou goods arrived, but the quantity was still limited. Since the Jiangsu provincial government banned exports from the Subei area, the arrival of goods has been hindered. Even in other guerrilla areas, transportation is difficult, so it is not easy for goods to flood the market. Cargo owners were quite firm on their selling prices, but factories disliked the high prices, so purchases were sharply reduced. Only 6,000 bags were sold in the overall market, handled equally by Fuxin and Fufeng factories. The highest price remained at 6 yuan and 7 jiao, and the market has stabilized. Yesterday, 2,600 bags of spot wheat arrived from Xingang.</p>
<h3>Ke Xian Rice Falls Back, Foreign Rice Remains Stable, Yuan Bao Stock Still Priced at 13 Yuan</h3>
<p>After several days of market price increases for Ke Xian rice, the source from Che Chuan has increased. Yesterday, 1,200 bags were shipped from Hupu, and even the special high-grade Nanjing Xian rice, considered a rare commodity, was transported to Shanghai, and the market immediately turned weak. The Wuhu Xian inventory was originally sufficient, and the floating goods arriving in port continuously sought to be sold urgently. Yesterday, the overall market price dropped by a small amount, from four to five fen to nearly a jiao.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice</p>
<p>The local market sales were slightly more active, with a few hundred bags of Saigon rice being traded at around 14 yuan and 5 fen. The price, including fees and commissions, for delivery was still around 14 yuan and 3 jiao. This price is not significantly different from the selling price a month ago. As the inventory of foreign rice is low and arrivals are scarce, cargo owners are unwilling to depreciate and sell at a loss again, so they firmly maintain the original price and do not follow the same trend as the local Ke Xian rice. As for the Yuan Bao stock stored in the concession, 300 bags were traded yesterday, still at the original price of 13 yuan, but the bags were full weight, with each bag weighing 185 jin.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods - Sichuan and Yunnan Sales Active - Colored Cloth Supply Falls Short of Demand - Singapore and Siam Purchase Actively - Eastern Cloth Sales Slow, White Cloth Prices Soften</h3>
<p>National Cloth</p>
<p>The market has been rising too rapidly in recent days, causing instability in people's minds. Yesterday, the yarn market fell back, and sellers suddenly increased, causing great confusion in the market, with differences as large as two or three jiao. The selling prices of most colored cloth and printed goods were similar to the previous day. The coarse cloth market has been the most stable recently. The prices of other cloths have already risen. The prices of fine cloth and fine twill have risen by about one yuan compared to the end of last month, while the prices of most coarse cloths remain at the original prices. Yesterday, the goods of Yih Ho were slightly tight, and there were still transactions at the original prices. Hand-sewn goods increased by five fen to one jiao. The local and Ning Shao Wen gangs purchased over 300 packages. Fine cloth and fine twill were priced too high, and the customer gangs gradually purchased cheap goods, which needed to be digested. Dyed cloth was cheaper than white cloth, so the customer gangs chose to purchase cheaper goods, and new transactions were quite sporadic. The supply of colored cloth was still short of demand. There were also large orders for white cloth from Chinese factories. The Shantou gang purchased dyed cloths such as Guang Xie, Se Xie, Blue Cloth, and Standard Cloth, totaling 300 boxes. The Chongqing gang had not purchased for a long time. Now that transportation in Sichuan and Yunnan is fast and convenient, they added purchases of colored cloth, colored Xie, bleached cloth, and bleached Xie, totaling over 2,000 pieces. The Kunming and Chengdu purchases also began, with continued purchases of colored cloth, colored Xie, bleached cloth, and printed goods, totaling over 3,000 pieces. White cloth, fine cloth, fine Xie, and fine twill were also continuously shipped out. The Gan gang transported goods from Ou, including fine cloth, bleached cloth, striped Xie, and fine Xie, totaling over 50 pieces. For foreign countries, Singapore purchased 50 to 60 boxes of Lun Chang printed cloth, bleached cloth, and colored cloth from various factories.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth</p>
<p>Yesterday, actual sales slowed down, and the price of white cloth suddenly softened. Fine cloth and fine twill uniformly fell. Fine cloth was severely affected by the dumping of goods by fellow merchants in the market, with prices falling by about one jiao and a half per piece. However, the market prices remained firm and did not loosen, so no one inquired about them. The trading volume of spot goods outside the market was less than 1,000 pieces, all of which were transferred to local merchants and colored cloth shops for dyeing and sales. The prices of coarse cloth were relatively firm, with 13.5-pound Niutou selling for 11 yuan and 2 and a half jiao per piece. The customer sales of Four Gentlemen Serge and Zhigong were still strong, and the market prices slightly increased, opening at 3 jiao and 9 fen per yard, an increase of 5 li compared to last week.</p>
<p>Exports</p>
<p>The cloth exports today totaled 225 pieces, shipped to Shantou, and another five pieces were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea - Japan Dumps Chinese Silk in France Again - Causing Local Factories Not to Insist - Instead Hoping Silk Market Falls to Lower Cocoon Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign silk markets, as reported by Japanese and American newspapers, continued to fall, with only Lyon Shanghai Silk A grade and Guangdong silk showing a slight increase. Therefore, the market in this port was quiet for the American market and there were slight inquiries for the French market. Market forecasts suggest there may be further declines, so manufacturers' price holdings have loosened. It is heard that Bai Factory 78 points has entered the 1,290 yuan level, and the RR character is sold for 1,250 yuan, which is considered a good price. According to industry insiders, the New York market is reacting due to excessive inventory, and the French market has discovered that the Japanese are dumping Chinese silk, so manufacturers in Shanghai are afraid to insist again. At the same time, the price of cocoons in this port has risen too sharply, with native species priced at 220-230 yuan. Therefore, most silk manufacturers hope that silk prices will fall to suppress the cocoon market, so the silk market may continue to decline. Yesterday, twenty-five pieces of silk were shipped to Haiphong. Sichuan angelica has demand in various places, and there are many channels to Shantou and Hong Kong. Recently, the bottom inventory here has become thin, and news from Sichuan says that this year's production is not high. The previous market price was 450 yuan per dan, and now it is tightly priced at 500 yuan. If the subsequent goods do not follow, the upward trend is imaginable.</p>
<h3>Coal - Yuanshan Bituminous Coal - Price Reduction Sales</h3>
<p>Although a large batch of bituminous coal has arrived in port recently to meet the market demand, due to high costs, sellers are unwilling to depreciate and sell at a loss, resulting in few transactions. On the contrary, Zhongjue goods are cheaper and have more active sales. Recently, a certain foreign firm has obtained Yuanshan coal, stored it in Pudong warehouses, and entrusted a certain firm to manage and sell it at reduced prices. The overall coal price is only 33 yuan per ton, and coal dust is 30 yuan. Loading from the warehouse and barging are extra.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Continues to Register Students Above Specialized School Level - Those Who Pass the Review Can Study at Designated Schools</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Communication) The Ministry of Education has already issued travel expenses to the first batch of students above the specialized school level in the war zone who have passed the registration and allocated them to various schools to study. However, as the war zone has expanded compared to before, there are still many young people out of school. The second batch of registration has recently begun. All those who go to register should submit supporting documents. After passing the review, they can receive travel expenses and go to designated schools to study.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education - Recent Educational Administrative Measures (Continued) - Compiling Educational Expenditure Budgets and Inspecting Schools in Various Counties - Promoting Education in Guerrilla Areas and Restoring Free Education</h3>
<p>(4) Approving the Educational Expenditure Budget for Northern Jiangsu. Before the start of the 27th year, the war in Northern Jiangsu was tense. The compilation of the educational expenditure budget and administrative plan for this year in various counties was not carried out according to the plan. Later, as the war situation improved, it was ordered to be carried out. Since the year had already begun, the budget was yet to be established, and the plan should be confirmed. After urging subordinates to speed up the review, all educational expenditure budgets and administrative plans for the period from July to December of the 27th year in various counties in Northern Jiangsu have been successively approved and amended, and orders have been issued to comply with them.</p>
<p>(5) Formulating Standards for Compiling Educational Expenditure Budgets for Various Counties</p>
<p>The accounting year, as ordered, will start with the calendar year from January of the 28th year, and the 18th year will begin in the blink of an eye. Standards for compiling educational expenditure budgets for various counties urgently need to be formulated and promulgated. After consulting with the Department of Finance, and according to the general situation of educational expenditure income in various counties in Northern Jiangsu, the "Points to Note for Various Counties in Compiling the Educational Expenditure Budget for the 28th Year" were formulated and promulgated to various counties, ordering them to compile and submit the educational expenditure budget for the 28th year within the time limit for approval and implementation by the provincial department.</p>
<p>(6) Promoting Educational Undertakings in Various Counties in Guerrilla Areas</p>
<p>The county governments in the guerrilla areas have been established one after another, and local education urgently needs to be reorganized and restored to maintain public morale and cultivate the strength to resist Japan and build the country. In consideration of the actual situation in various counties, three types of plans were formulated: "Jiangsu Province's Plan for Reorganizing Education in Fallen Counties," "Jiangsu Province's Provisional Measures for Restoring Primary Schools at All Levels in Fallen Counties," and "Jiangsu Province's Provisional Measures for Establishing Private Schools in Townships in Fallen Counties," as the guideline for promoting educational undertakings in fallen counties. Efforts should be made to restore local educational administrative institutions in fallen counties, and schools at all levels should be able to continue classes. If schools cannot be fully restored for a while due to funding reasons, and in places where it is not convenient to establish schools openly, private schools are specially allowed to be established to secretly implement education for resisting Japan and building the country. This plan and measures have been approved by the provincial government committee and ordered to be implemented.</p>
<p>(7) Reorganizing Public and Private Schools in the Province That Have Resumed Classes on Their Own</p>
<p>There are many provincial secondary schools and private secondary schools that have been registered and have moved to Shanghai or other locations to resume classes on their own after the outbreak of the war. There are also many private secondary schools from other provinces and cities that have moved to various counties in this province to resume classes, as well as newly established private secondary schools. For the sake of unified management, the Department of Education has specially formulated "Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education's Provisional Measures for Managing Provincial Secondary Schools That Have Resumed Classes on Their Own" and "Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education's Provisional Measures for Managing Wartime Private Secondary Schools," which were submitted to the Provincial Government's Council for approval and reported to the Ministry of Education for record. These measures have been communicated to the provincial schools and private secondary schools that have resumed classes for compliance.</p>
<p>(8) Planning to Restore Free Education in Various Counties</p>
<p>Promoting compulsory education is the most important basic work for various counties during the period of resistance against Japan. The compulsory classes in various counties in Jiangsu Province were inevitably slightly affected because the central government stopped subsidizing funds. The Department of Education has specially drafted the "Jiangsu Province's Measures for Restoring Compulsory Education in Various Counties in the 28th Year," which was submitted to the Provincial Government Committee for approval, and requested the Ministry of Education to continue to allocate funds for subsidies, so that free education in this province can be promoted as usual and eliminate illiteracy throughout the province. The Department of Education is also conducting a detailed investigation of the situation of promoting free education in the 24th, 25th, and 26th years in various counties, the number of compulsory classes set up each year, the provincial funding of county-raised funds, and the monthly subsidies.</p>
<p>(9) Enriching the Scientific Equipment of Various Secondary Schools</p>
<p>The temporary middle schools and normal schools established by the Department of Education have very simple equipment due to funding reasons. In order to enrich the content of each school and facilitate teaching, the original provincial school custodians are ordered to prepare a list of books, instruments, chemical supplies, and sports equipment in the school and report it to the Department of Education, which will then allocate them to various provincial temporary secondary schools for application.</p>
<p>(10) Urging Primary and Secondary Schools to Implement Wartime Curriculum</p>
<p>The Department of Education, at this time of resisting Japan and building the country, urges provincial schools and primary and secondary schools in various counties to actively promote wartime education and cultivate the strength to resist Japan and build the country. In addition to formulating the "General Rules for the Organization of Subject Teaching Material Research Associations in Jiangsu Provincial Secondary Schools" and issuing them to provincial secondary schools for compliance and active research, and collecting subject teaching materials for resisting Japan and building the country for submission to the Department for review and adoption, it also issued the "Implementation Measures for Wartime Special Education in Primary and Secondary Schools" to primary and secondary schools in various counties for reference and implementation, and to earnestly promote education for resisting Japan and building the country.</p>
<p>(11) Clearing Provincial and County Educational Expenditure Assets</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education issued an order to promulgate a method for clearing educational deposits in provinces and cities in the war zone, ordering the establishment of a clearing committee to clear the deposits of educational institutions in the war zone. "Two Types of Measures for Clearing Educational Expenditure Assets in Jiangsu Province at the Provincial and County Levels" and "Budget of the Clearing Committee for Educational Expenditure Assets in Jiangsu Province at the Provincial and County Levels" were drafted, which were approved by the Provincial Government Committee and submitted to the Ministry of Education for record. According to these measures, in addition to establishing a clearing committee at the Huaiyin Department of Education, offices will also be set up in Shanghai and Chongqing to facilitate clearing nearby.</p>
<p>(12) Reorganizing Educational Laws and Regulations in this Province</p>
<p>Educational laws and regulations in Jiangsu Province have not been reorganized for many years. The editorial office was specially dispatched to collect various educational laws and regulations promulgated in Jiangsu Province in the past, and to reorganize those that are currently applicable. It also collected various wartime laws and regulations newly promulgated by the Ministry of Education and compiled them together with the new laws and regulations promulgated by the Department of Education. This work has now been completed, and after it is printed, it will be distributed to the competent personnel of educational institutions throughout the province for compliance and implementation.</p>
<h3>School Overview: Zhi Zhong Girls' Middle School</h3>
<p>Zhi Zhong Girls' Middle School was founded in the spring of five years ago. At that time, although there were many girls' middle schools in the western part of Shanghai, there were very few schools that were well-managed and excellent in both management and education, except for a few established by churches and foreigners. Ms. Chen Naiwen, who had long served in various universities and famous girls' middle schools in Shanghai, saw that the right to girls' education had long been manipulated by foreigners, so she invested in founding a girls' middle school on Avenue Edward VII and Seymour Road, named Zhi Zhong Girls' Middle School. The name Zhi Zhong means that everyone can manage their own inner self and achieve the effect of being beautiful on the outside and wise on the inside. After one year, the results were remarkable, and the Municipal Education Bureau specially approved the registration. Since then, the number of students has increased day by day, and the original school site was insufficient, so it was moved to the current address at No. 186 Nanyang Road. This place has the advantage of a garden and is quiet in the midst of the bustling city, making it an ideal place for both studying and resting.</p>
<p>The school is divided into junior and senior high school departments. The senior high school is further divided into business and general subjects, with a total of nine grades and more than 200 students. The faculty members, such as Jiang Zaihua, Zhang Zhongying, Yang Zhenou, Chen Qiuyi, Xia Jinhui, Bao Guanying, Qian Zhaolong, Wang Jialing, Zhu Baoyuan, Wu Shusheng, Yang Mingde, and Li Ruihua, are all scholars with rich knowledge and extensive experience. Therefore, graduates from each session can directly enter famous universities such as Soochow, Yuling, and Shanghai Baptist University. The students studying at the school are also diligent and conscientious because the school values strict education and to avoid being forced to withdraw from school for failing three subjects.</p>
<p>Student extracurricular activities are mostly focused on literature and art. There are the Zhong Sheng Monthly Society and the Shen Sheng Drama Society. The "Artist" and "Peerless Sister", which won the approval of most audiences at the Lyceum Theatre before, were performed by the society. Their literary and artistic cultivation is not accidental.</p>
<p>The school has always valued practicality and does not engage in ostentation. Therefore, although the school has been around for five years, people in the community may not know about it, because the school is buried in hard work and has no time to promote itself extensively. This reporter learned about its past and present situation as above through a detailed conversation with the principal of the school.</p>

<h3>New Six Table Tennis Hualian Won Yesterday; Youbang You Raised a Protest, Claiming the Referee Made a Mistake</h3>

<h3>Huang Bochang Wins Far East Wrestling Championship</h3>
<p>(Singapore Correspondent) Chinese wrestling champion Huang Bochang performed in Shanghai a few years ago and defeated the famous Indian general. Last year, he sailed to various parts of Southeast Asia and was invincible. Recently, Huang competed here with Singapore's strong general Jia Daxing for the Far East Championship. The two sides fought fiercely. Although Huang was repeatedly pressured, he finally relied on his skillful technique to defeat the enemy general and win the final victory, winning the Far East Wrestling Championship. More than 2,000 overseas Chinese cheered and rejoiced.</p>
<h3>Washington Basketball Team Passed Through Shanghai Yesterday on Their Way to the Philippines; May Perform in Shanghai on Their Return to the United States</h3>
<p>The Washington University basketball team, which has been widely publicized, led by captain Kenyon, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning on the Asia Queen from Japan. The team did not stay in Japan, so their arrival in Shanghai was earlier than expected. Due to the sudden change in the ship's schedule, they toured various places in the city for a week and then took the original ship to Manila in the Philippines at 1:00 PM. It is a pity that the team could not try their skills in this city. However, it is said that the team may give a demonstration game in this city on their way back to the United States from Manila.</p>

<h3>Death</h3>
<p>— Geng</p>
<p>Death is the most painful and the most difficult to attain. Therefore, people generally have concepts of death that are either curses or praises.</p>
<p>Death is most painful, which is objective. "Living people parting from the dead is a hatred that cannot be discussed." In other words, only the living can feel the pain of death. Death is most difficult to attain, which is subjective. Everyone is afraid of death, but if you can abandon everything and bravely rush to death, it is difficult to attain. Therefore, death can be lighter than a feather or heavier than Mount Tai. To die when one should not die, or to die when it is not necessary to die, is lighter than a feather; to die when one should die, or to dare to die when one must die, is heavier than Mount Tai. The former's death, because the death is not in the right place, not only cannot gain the sympathy of society, but on the contrary, because it leaves a bad impression, it will also be唾罵ed by society. The latter's death, because he died in the right place, gives people a loyal and chaste story that can be emulated by those who die later, so it is worthy of praise.</p>
<p>In the torrent of resistance against Japan, there are too many stories of death! The soldiers in the front, for the nation, for the country, for justice, died in the thousands and tens of thousands before the god of war. They are the death warriors of the Republic of China and the pioneers of justice and reason. History will not fail to solemnly record their heroic achievements of sacrifice and their spirit of regarding death as home; this will be put aside for now. In the occupied areas, there are also many stories of willing self-sacrifice and scandals of corpses lying in the streets; these many deaths not only have differences in lightness and weight, but also have differences in obedience and resistance.</p>
<p>According to a correspondent from Taixian in this newspaper, Zhenjiang educator Hui Ren was the director of the Dantu County Encouragement of Learning Institute, and Xu Shizhu was the director of the Zhenjiang County Education Bureau. He was from Dagang Township in Zhenjiang and was praised by the township party and society for his morality and writing. Recently, because his nephew Xu X joined the enemy in the township, he strongly advised him to leave, but he refused. Considering it a great shame and humiliation, he committed suicide by throwing himself into the river in Xinzhou a few days ago to serve his country. Those who are willing to be traitors should be ashamed to death. It is said that Xu X felt quite remorseful after hearing the news of his uncle's suicide by throwing himself into the river.</p>
<p>Xu Shizhu committed suicide by throwing himself into the river because his nephew joined the enemy and he was unable to stop him. This not only showed his sense of shame but also showed his ambition. This behavior is certainly deeply moving and worthy of admiration! However, although his death has considerable value, his attempt to use this method of remonstration to exchange for his unfilial nephew's remorse is still open to discussion.</p>
<p>Traitors have no soul. They do not know what is called integrity or moral courage. Our only way to deal with this group of beasts in human clothing and criminals of the nation is to "kill without mercy." It is useless to advise or remonstrate. Since Mr. Xu Shizhu had the courage to die, under the lesson of "strongly advising him to leave but he refused," if he could not use a white blade to kill his unfilial nephew and eliminate a degenerate for the country, and strive for a little righteousness between heaven and earth, he could launch a broad anti-traitor movement and awaken the consciousness of the compatriots in the occupied areas. If this resulted in death, then death would be more valuable and more difficult to attain.</p>
<p>Therefore, we believe that we must have the courage to die, and at the same time, we must have the ambition to demand the price of death.</p>
<h3>Chongqing's Newspapers</h3>
<p>— Guan Bao</p>
<p>Chongqing—China's current capital, the number of newspapers issued there far exceeds that in other places. Even Shanghai, which had a population of three million before the war, only issued ten kinds of newspapers, but now Chongqing has as many as twelve kinds.</p>
<p>Most of these twelve kinds of newspapers were forced to withdraw from Shanghai, Nanjing, Tianjin, and Hankou because of the shift in the front line.</p>
<p>These many newspapers certainly have their own interests, but they are consistently the same in supporting the central government and supporting Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's war of resistance against Japan.</p>
<p>The Central Daily News is the mouthpiece of the Kuomintang and the only guiding newspaper in the current period of resistance. After the fall of Nanjing, the newspaper moved to Changsha for publication. In September of last year, it moved from Changsha to Chongqing and was first published on September 15th; it only left a branch office in Changsha. The Ta Kung Pao is the most authoritative newspaper and has always been one of China's four major newspapers. It was first in Tianjin, then in Shanghai, and now, in addition to being published in Hong Kong, it was also published in Chongqing on December 1st of last year. In addition, there is the Sao Dang Bao, which moved from Hankou, and the Southwest Daily, which is published locally. Although they were born in different places, they can be called brother newspapers because they are all in the same voice as the "Whampoa system" in the government: the former is famous for its detailed military reports, and the latter is known to be affiliated with the Commander-in-Chief's headquarters and pays the most attention to the economic construction of the southwestern provinces. The authorities once had two decisions to merge these two newspapers, but the result was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>The Shi Shi Xin Bao and the Xin Min Bao are also newspapers that withdrew. The Shi Shi Xin Bao was originally published in Shanghai and moved to Chongqing for publication at the beginning of last year. The person behind it now is Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi. The Xin Min Bao is a newspaper that moved from Nanjing and is run by a member of the Kuomintang. After the fall of Nanjing, it was the first to move to Chongqing for publication.</p>
<p>The Xinhua Daily is the organ of the Chinese Communist Party. It publishes many messages from the Soviet Russian news agency TASS, as well as many comments and reports on the mass movement. Every day, TASS's messages take up half a page, and the editorials are based on the communist political system and are written by those in charge on a rotational basis. The newspaper was first published in Hankou in January of last year and moved to Chongqing just before the withdrawal from Wuhan.</p>
<p>Some people may think that the local newspapers in Chongqing may not be able to compete with the newspapers that have withdrawn? This is really inaccurate. There are six local newspapers: the National Public Newspaper, the New Sichuan Newspaper, the Jichuan Public Newspaper, the Southwest Daily, the Dajiang Daily, and the Commercial Daily. The first two newspapers are still more popular than the several newspapers that have withdrawn, because their readers are a group of people who are interested in news and are not involved in political relations.</p>
<p>The Jichuan Public Newspaper is the semi-official newspaper of the Sichuan Provincial Government, the Commercial Daily is issued by the local Chamber of Commerce, and the Dajiang Daily is related to the personnel of the Provincial Government.</p>
<p>The sales of various newspapers in Chongqing, according to reliable sources, are estimated as follows:</p>
<p>Central Daily News (5,000 copies) Riri Xinbao (6,000 copies) Ta Kung Pao (7,000 copies) Xinhua Daily (6,000 copies) National Public Newspaper (6,000 copies) Xin Min Bao (8,000 copies) New Sichuan Newspaper (7,000 copies) Sao Dang Bao (6,000 copies) Southwest Daily (2,000 copies) Jichuan Public Newspaper (500 copies) Commercial Daily (500 copies) Dajiang Daily (500 copies)</p>
<p>Due to the lack of printing equipment, all newspapers in Chongqing are limited to issuing one large sheet, divided into four pages, all of the same size. Only the Xin Min Bao is an exception, because it is a small newspaper.</p>
<p>It is very strange that all local newspapers adopt the British style of editing, that is, the first page does not contain any editorials or news. However, the Xinhua Daily of the Communist Party is an exception, it publishes two commentaries on the first page; the Xin Min Bao is based on the American style of editing, and its first</p>
<h3>Shanghai's Bars</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhenshan</p>
<p>Every day, when the night falls, those bars filled with a strong sense of mystery and excitement begin to become active in the competition for nightlife in the happy corners of the city. Huge neon colored electric torch characters twinkle on the street and glitter at the door, like the charming smiles of girls and the leaping of children, complementing the aroma of wine and the tune of jazz music that overflow from the glass door, giving the lonely passers-by an inducement to numb their minds, making them throw themselves into that drunken, lewd, and decadent garden, and dyeing a layer of joyful color on the lonely and depressed souls.</p>
<p>Before the "August 13th" Incident, North Sichuan Road and Broadway Road in the "Mysterious Street" were thriving places for this kind of consumption that combines the double stimulation of alcohol and women. However, now, they have all been transplanted from the dark "hell" to the happy "heaven," so that Avenue Joffre, Avenue Edward VII, and Zhu Bao San Road have thickened their original alluring scenery and faded their former desolation and coldness; every house is filled with the darlings of heaven living in paradise, filling every nook and cranny like waves! The women who sell their souls in exchange for life's sustenance also grin and smile coquettishly, so charmingly comforting groups of lonely people like hungry tigers, letting others hug, dance, and tease them, accompanying the blurred drunken sailors with laughter and joy that carries pain. They are indeed great people who indirectly prosper the bars.</p>
<p>Therefore, every bar is equipped with musicians and dancers, or at least employs a few beautiful waitresses, so that those alien drunkards from distant oceans can get a little erotic tenderness. As long as one side is completely occupied by advertisements. As for printing, only the Xinhua Daily uses color.</p>
<p>Chongqing has a population of about 500,000 to 700,000, which does not actually require so many newspapers. The overlapping news reports in various newspapers are simply a waste of manpower and resources.</p>
<p>Until now, there is still no English-language newspaper in Chongqing. This kind of newspaper is really needed, because the number of foreigners in Chongqing has increased a lot. Recently, there has been a rumor that a foreign newspaper in Hankou will be moved to resume publication. If this comes true, it will enable foreigners traveling in Chongqing to also read the newspapers and understand the current news.</p>
<p>If you have money in your pocket, you can arrogantly hug them, drink from the same cup, kiss their lips sweetly, or crazily tease them on the ground.</p>
<p>There are also small bars run jointly by Western couples, and this kind of scene also appears. The husband pours wine, and the wife dances with the guests, smiling. In a pretentious society where feudalism has not been completely eliminated and women have not completely escaped the bondage of one-sided chastity, some people may shake their heads and sigh when they see this kind of situation. However, they seem to be standing at the forefront of the times and have a generous and forbearing attitude, even though they are trying to break free from the shackles of life.</p>
<p>If you hesitate in front of those bars, poke your head under the neon electric torch characters of "Bar Coffee," listen to the gentle tunes, smell the fragrant aroma of wine, and watch the women's charming and frivolous smiles, the drunkards' passionate enthusiasm, the teasing of money and flesh exchanging, and all the indescribable ease and pleasure swirling around, you will not be able to freely control yourself, grasp your reason, and be intoxicated by the reality in front of you, immersing a pure heart in beautiful reveries, and resolutely stepping into that vortex to seek the fun of excitement.</p>
<p>However, if you are a yellow person and your demeanor is not sophisticated, you may be ridiculed by them, because they come into contact with maritime heroes - sailors - every day. Those tycoons of the gold dollar kingdom, widowers without the burden of living expenses, exchange wads of banknotes for wine and women like they are scattering seeds, cultivating the prosperity of almost the entire Zhu Bao San Road! Therefore, the general bosses and dance halls especially welcome them, treat them with extraordinary closeness, serve them, and flatter them! If we use a solemn and naughty statement to describe them, then they and she are a group of skilled craftsmen who create good phenomena in international trade deficits!</p>
<h3>The Fruit Market of the Sixteenth Dock</h3>
<p>— Yushan</p>
<p>Strolling south along the Bund Road in the French Concession, one reaches the terminus of the Concession tramway. The thoroughfare leading to the South City presents a scene of constant commotion, clamor, shouting, and bustling crowds, day after day. After the war, the iron gates were closed, cutting off traffic, as if separated by the boundary between life and death. Looking south, one saw only dilapidated walls, a stretch of rubble, a desolate and cold scene, truly like the silence of death, inevitably stirring endless sorrow.</p>
<p>From Fujian Road (not Shilu) south to the iron gates, this short stretch is lined with fruit and produce stores, interspersed with a few salted fish shops. Before the war, the fruit and produce businesses were mostly located in the Dongmen Road and Guoma Road area of the South City, with only three or four long-established businesses here. Now, the South City businesses have all moved here, clustering along the tramway station area. More than twenty have relocated along both sides of Yuhang Street, making it the central location for the fruit and produce trade.</p>
<p>The businesses are divided into two types: specialized and combined. Specialized businesses focus on fruits or produce, while combined businesses handle both fruits and produce, or even add northern goods to their offerings. As the end of the year approaches, the fruit business focuses on Guang oranges, Fu oranges, Shantou honey oranges, American honey oranges, green olives, bananas, and sugarcane. The produce business concentrates on mustard greens, old ginger, peanuts, and winter bamboo shoots. Northern goods are limited to chestnuts, walnuts, and dried longans. They all serve as wholesale distributors for customers, selling in bulk and not retail. They are the general distribution center for the city's fruit and produce trade. Before the war, they also wholesaled to other cities, but that is now rare.</p>
<p>From five to ten o'clock every morning is the market time. Nearly all the clerks of the city's fruit stores, small vendors, and peddlers in amusement parks and wharves rush to buy wholesale. The doorways of each business are packed with people, a sea of heads moving about. Clerks are frantically busy, trading boxes of oranges, bundles of sugarcane, bags of mustard greens amid the noisy shouting. On the roads, numerous vehicles are carrying goods away, while others are parked waiting to load, creating a bustling scene that is truly hard to describe.</p>
<p>Yuhang Street was also a place of thriving business and the most prosperous place for fish merchants. Before the war, due to the establishment of the fish market, the fish merchants here were ordered to relocate, resulting in a sudden decline. After the war, various businesses gradually reopened here, resuming operations. Therefore, every morning, fishmongers from various markets come here to buy wholesale. The bustling scene is comparable to that of the fruit merchants, truly worthy of being called equals.</p>
<h3>Rain Over Azure Sky, Chapter 1: The One-Armed Old Man Organizes a Free Village, Twin Daughters Reverently Visit the Martyrs' Tomb</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>The fathers of these two Miss He Xiaoda are an international trader from China who has businesses in Singapore and other regions. He is currently helping the government manage import and export trade. In the past, he was called a Huaqiao (Overseas Chinese), but currently, he constantly travels between overseas and mainland China. Because the transportation between Europe, America, and China is extremely convenient now. This time, why are the two Miss Hes visiting Zhu Airen? It turns out that their father is an important figure in the International Trade Commission of the Central Government, and he received an order from the government to come to the capital. Furthermore, he also has many public and private matters to handle in Shanghai. The two Miss Hes heard that their father was coming here, and they also wanted to come along. Firstly, since returning to the country, they have wanted to travel to several major cities in China to broaden their knowledge. They are not reliant on a profession to make a living, but their aspiration is that every citizen, male or female, should have a profession. Since returning to the country, they have not yet taken a job, and now they want to see various places in the country first, broaden their horizons, and then choose a profession, which would be the best thing. Secondly, they can take this opportunity to visit their good friend Zhu Airen. Although they communicate often since returning to the country, letters are not as intimate as meeting in person. Zhu Airen often writes letters inviting them to come, and they also often write letters inviting Zhu Airen to go. But Zhu Airen does not have the time to go, because she cannot leave the infirmary. Therefore, she asks the two Miss Hes to come, so the two Miss Hes are now truly here. Their father was very happy to hear that they wanted to come along. At this time, there are two flights departing from Hong Kong to Shanghai every day. So, he sent someone to the China Travel Service to book three seats on the Hong Kong-Shanghai flight of the China National Aviation Corporation and flew to Shanghai. They stayed in Shanghai for a week, living in one of the largest hotels in Shanghai. The hotel also has over thirty floors, which is considered the tallest building in Shanghai. Shanghai is still a prosperous and luxurious area. Although all sovereignty belongs to China, merchants from all over the world gather here, and it is still a large port for the exchange of goods. China is a newly emerging country after the war, and construction projects all rely on the help of people from Europe and America. Some are related to technology, and some are related to capital. They are all willing to come to the East. Because the first major country in the East, the Republic of China, is a country with the richest resources, the largest population, and the deepest reserves. (10)</p>

<h3>A Record of the Surviving Qin of Sun Zuochen</h3>
<p>— Su Shaoqing</p>
<p>Having seen the two articles in this publication, "Sun Zuochen's Surviving Qin" by Mr. Ruoqi and "The Reality of Being Deceived by Xu Muyun" by Mr. Xu Muyun, I could not help but feel a mix of sadness and emotion! The peerless qin player, Sun Zuochen, died in poverty the year before last, and his two sons and one daughter also died one after another. Sun's qin skills have since been silenced. There is only a surviving qin, which I keep in my possession. Every morning and evening, I play the qin and remember the person. How can I not be sad! Now, I will describe the appearance of this qin and the experience of obtaining it, to inform the music lovers of the world.</p>
<p>Sun Zuochen had an unusual appearance. His personality was also particularly strange. In his later years, he lived in Shanghai, quite destitute. I provided him with some assistance. Therefore, we met every evening. He played the qin, and I sang. This went on for half a year. One day, Zuochen and I played the qin together for a Qingke Cairen (a type of performing artist) who was singing in the theater. (The Beizhan Piaofang (theatrical troupe) was performing in the Cairen style at the Lake Society. Shen Junhong was singing "Hongyang Cave" and Zhang Jun was singing "Maca Cao.") When Zuochen played the qin, he would adjust the strings when the performer was about to start singing on stage. With two twists of the strings, the pitch would be accurate, without fail. He had made it a habit and was proud of it. Others could not imitate it. At that time, the Yinzi (prelude) was finished. Zuochen took the qin out of the qin bag and was shocked and lost his color. It turned out that he had not checked it beforehand, and the snakeskin was broken. (This is commonly called "jumping into the well," "trapped in a bamboo horse trap." Replacing the snakeskin is possible.) It was impossible to make sound. Fortunately, I had a good qin with me (a gift from my friend, Mr. Qian), and I quickly took it out and gave it to him. The qin in his hand was also extraordinary. Zuochen was therefore grateful to me. He smiled and said to me, "Your qin is indeed good, but my qin has been with me for more than fifty years. It has had two great adventures: First, the Guangxu Emperor took it into the inner palace. It was only through begging the chief eunuch that I was able to get it back. Second, a certain Japanese person wanted to exchange it for a thousand taels of gold, but I was unwilling. Although this qin has jumped into the well today, like a person suddenly suffering a serious illness and losing his voice, even if he is a great hero, he becomes useless for the time being. I am already seventy-five years old and old. One day I will definitely give this qin to you as a gift." I had wanted to get his qin for a long time, and I was very happy to hear this. Three months later, Zuochen was sick and could not get up. I went to comfort him. Zuochen took the qin from the wall and asked me to take it away. I said, "Later, later, there is no hurry." After another ten days or so, Zuochen died. More than ten days after the funeral, his son, named Wu, brought an object, which was this qin. And he said, "His father left a will, definitely to give it to a certain Su." Therefore, this qin was stored in my leaky room. Zuochen kept his promise, wasn't he an extraordinary person?</p>
<p>This qin has a bamboo pole that is one Chi, six Cun, and four Fen in length (the Yingzao Chi, or builder's foot, is divided into ten Cun, and each Cun is divided into ten Fen, so 8.1 Cun equals 1 Chi). The distance from the first bamboo joint to the drum surface is one Cun and six Fen. (The length of the distance between the first bamboo joint and the drum surface is related to the quality of the sound.) The "smart hole" is eight Fen long and two Fen wide, smaller than the holes on other huqins. (The "smart hole" is a rectangular hole opened in the part of the bamboo pole that is inside the drum. The size and length of this hole are very important to the sound of the qin. Any increase or decrease, even slightly, affects the quality of the sound. Sun Zuochen said: He had a good qin made of Luohan bamboo, but he thought the sound was still not bright enough. He took it upon himself to lengthen the "smart hole" by about one Fen. The sound of the qin became dark and dull. Because of this, he did not eat for several days and was unhappy for more than a month. Later, he found an expert to fix it, and the sound returned, but it was not as good as before. The "smart hole" of this qin is particularly small, so its sound is concentrated and heroic.) The drum is three Cun and four Fen long. The diameter of the round back is slightly more than one Cun and three Fen, and the diameter of the round front, where the snakeskin is, is one Cun and two Fen. The drum is smaller in the front and larger in the back, and the front is not a perfect circle, but an ellipse, all presenting a strange and unique shape, very different from other qins.</p>
<p>The whole body of this qin is covered with a buildup of rosin, like the green and coppery stains of ancient bronze. Where it is frequently touched, it is red and purple and lustrous, like cinnabar stains.</p>
<p>This qin is like an old steed. When it meets a Bole (a legendary judge of horses) who holds the reins, it will let out a long roar and be able to travel a thousand miles. It is also like a bad horse. When played by an incompetent musician, it will invariably stumble and fall off the saddle. It not only doesn't sound, but also makes it impossible to make a tune or a sound. How strange! I consider my skills to be between those of Bole and an incompetent musician. Sometimes, when I am happy, I pick up the qin and play it. Although I cannot follow in the footsteps of Sun and Chen (Chen Yanheng), I play ancient tunes alone and am content with myself. Life is about being happy. Why seek recognition from others?</p>
<p>This qin requires the use of hard erhu strings, thick old strings, and the use of force that penetrates deep into the wood to produce a deep, sonorous sound. Gentle strings and weak fingers will be laughed at by the soul of the qin. Since this qin came into my possession, every time I replace the snakeskin, I must ask "Little Shaoxing" of Lü Shunchang to do it. When he sees it, he will definitely say, "This is Sun's qin." It is known by those who know it. Some say that this qin is about eighty years old and is the legacy of Sun's teacher, "Cha San." Am I not lucky to have obtained this qin?</p>
<p>Alas, the surviving qin of a great Western musician is treasured by the whole world, worth tens of thousands of pounds. Now, Sun is also a great musician of China who is unsurpassed. Unfortunately, his surviving qin has fallen into my hands. Sun was poor all his life, and his qin could not show itself. When I play it and think of him, I burst into tears. I write this article to let the world know about Sun and his qin, for a thousand years of remembrance!</p>
<h3>Gu Wuwei Visits Fan Xuepeng Three Times - Fan Claims to Resign Again from Green Treasure -</h3>
<p>— Xiong Tang</p>
<p>Fan Xuepeng jumped from the silver screen to the stage, performing plays at the Green Treasure Theater, and then stopped performing due to lung disease and rested at home. The Green Treasure authorities once "visited her thatched cottage three times," earnestly inviting her to continue her performance. Under the "Three Laws Agreement," Xuepeng returned to the Green Treasure stage on New Year's Eve. At that time, the three agreed principles were: 1. Increase transportation fees by sixty yuan. 2. Provide a special resting room backstage. 3. Before the illness is completely recovered, she can ask for leave or stop performing at any time. This publication has detailed records of this matter.</p>
<p>Fan Xuepeng's illness has not yet fully recovered. The table in the backstage resting room is full of glass bottles and glasses containing pills. It is like a separated hospital. Working day and night is very tiring. Relying on her illness to perform on stage is not a long-term plan. Therefore, she used one of the clauses in the Three Laws Agreement to resign from Green Treasure. However, the Green Treasure authorities, because the theater is still full after she went on stage, are naturally reluctant to let go of this "goddess of wealth" easily. Of course, they warmly retained her and agreed to reduce some of the plays she performed, only asking her to perform one or two plays. The day shows do not necessarily have to be on stage every day, but can be on stage every Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday. However, the old "Fan School" audience of the Green Treasure Theater are writing letters at the same time, because she has very few plays in the new play "Eyer Mei", requesting to add more plays in the next new play "Mother's Secret", making the Green Treasure authorities in a dilemma. Fan Xuepeng's intention to resign is so firm, and it is said that it will be performed until the 15th. Whether to continue to serve in the position is still under negotiation.</p>
<p>Fan Xuepeng's firm resignation also involves Gu Wuwei. Gu Wuwei came to Shanghai from Hong Kong this time, in addition to paving the way for the Yi Mao New Year, there is also a new plan, which is to recruit talents from the Shanghai film and drama circles to Hong Kong to perform dramas. Seven or eight years ago, he took over the Qitian stage (the original site of the current Gong Stage) in Shanghai and performed the new play "Tixiao Yinyuan". In terms of talent, he adopted the "film and drama hybrid system", which was very profitable. Later, he opened docks in Nanjing, Hankou, Tianjin and Beiping, which also made a lot of money. This time, he plans to repeat the method he used eight years ago, so he brought his wife Lu Cuilan to contact separately. Outsiders do not know how the results are. Considering that Fan Xuepeng's Guan Xiugu in "Tixiao Yinyuan" was very popular, he has contacted Fan Xuepeng's residence in the Green Treasure backstage and Shenchengli three times. Although Gu Wuwei and his wife have returned to Xiangdao, the verbal agreement with Fan Xuepeng is still in an "unfinished" situation. Looking at it, Fan Xuepeng's resignation from Green Treasure has something to do with it!</p>
<h3>Gu Zhuanjie's The Tale of Selling a Horse</h3>
<p>— Xitong</p>
<p>Gu Zhuanjie's "The Tale of Selling a Horse", which I have been looking forward to for months, has finally arrived. This is truly a "dream come true"! (Note: This play, newly translated by Gu Zhongqiu, is similar to Gorky's "Her Lover.") This is the charity performance held by Guanghua University at the YMCA on the evening of the seventh.</p>
<p>Zhuanjie is a famous young actor of the Xian Ni Society. His "The Tale of Selling a Horse" and the complete scripts written by Yu Zhuanming have company recordings. Zhuanjie has long retired from singing and changed his name to Zhicheng, studying at Guanghua Middle School, and later graduated from the Department of Agriculture of Jinling University. Recently, I heard that he is teaching at Shicheng Middle School. This special invitation by Guanghua classmates to sing is truly a rare opportunity.</p>
<p>I personally feel particularly interested in "The Tale of Selling a Horse". It is funny and laughable to say it, but I only learned the script of "The Tale of Selling a Horse" for a week last year, and I even went on stage to try it out. I have no other skills. Because there was no rehearsal, when I was crying, the gauze hat wings touched Guizhi's headgear and made a clanging sound. When writing the script, I couldn't find a pen because of my nearsightedness. After a long time, I saw a small wooden stick, as thick as a sugarcane, and I thought it might be the so-called pen, so I picked it up confusedly. Fortunately, I didn't make a mistake, because I had never seen such a big pen before!</p>
<p>After watching Zhuanjie's "The Tale of Selling a Horse", Liu Lang dare not show off his poor skills anymore. I would like to write down the advantages of the "writing script" that I saw:</p>
<p>When singing "Say to the official, speak in detail," he pulled Guizhi's sleeve and stood up, the posture was very beautiful. He used both hands to slightly lift Guizhi's left sleeve and sway it, and the steps and rhythms were in harmony.</p>
<p>After listening to Guizhi's permission not to cry, he smiled. Then Guizhi cried, and he immediately hid his smile, opened his mouth, and made a disappointed and surprised expression. This is much better than the ordinary actor adding a sentence "She cried again." The emotions changed drastically, is this the so-called beauty of silence?</p>
<p>When saying "I think a person has two kinds of diseases," he would definitely rush through this part; Zhuanjie made a thoughtful look, pondering the situation, speaking in a low voice, and then saying "This must be false", which is also delicately good.</p>
<p>Listening to Guizhi singing "I have to draw up a confession in court", Zhuanjie said "It's over" three or four times, very anxiously, and suddenly found Guizhi kneeling on the ground, and hurriedly helped her up. When saying "Execution in autumn", he also said it three or four times and suddenly found Guizhi fainting, and hurriedly went to save her. They were all done very naturally. Others only say it once, not as thorough as Zhuanjie.</p>
<p>While reading the script to "Because of disobedience in adultery" and shaking his head, "Autumn will be..." and his hands trembled, the expression was realistic.</p>
<p>After all, Zhuanjie is a scholar. A scholar plays a scholar. It is his true colors. From the overall perspective, the singing voice is gentle, the demeanor is gentle, and there is no anger at all, which is truly admirable!</p>
<h3>Kun Actress Zhang Chuanfang's Assassination of the Tiger</h3>
<p>— Fan Yifeng</p>
<p>Zhang Chuanfang, a disciple of the Kunqu Opera Training Institute, is dedicated to learning female roles. She is skilled in many plays. Recently, she has frequently performed the assassination play "Fei Gongren Assassinating the Tiger," and she is a person with a heart. This play has some stimulating elements, so the Xian Ni Society has been full every time it has been posted recently, and its appeal is unusual. On stage, Chuanfang plays Fei Zhen'e, wearing palace attire - see photo - singing "Duān Zhèng Hǎo" (a musical tune). She embodies the anger of the state... In one scene, she vents all her grievances. Until she admits that she is a princess, Li Chuang uses his finger to point to the treasure tiger given to her by Si Liang (another traitor) and suddenly feels dizzy, and Zhen'e has the determination to die. Singing "Gǔn Xiù Qiú" (another musical tune), I grit my teeth, apply rouge to my hips, wipe away my tears, apply powder... In one scene, every word is a tear, making the audience feel as if they are in a real situation. Afterwards, she exchanges vows with the tiger and sends him to the bridal chamber. The tiger is already drunk. Zhen'e sings "Dāo Dāo Lìng" (another musical tune). On the silver hairpin... In one scene, she describes the pain of enduring humiliation. Then, singing "Tuō Bù Shān" (another musical tune) and "Xiǎo Cài Liáng Zhōu" (another musical tune), "Take off..." Since I cannot kill the traitor, I should kill a tiger. So the performer takes off her palace attire, puts on a black coat, and holds a steel dagger in her hand, singing "Kuài Huó Sān" (another musical tune). On the steel knife... In one scene, she shows a heroic spirit that shames the eyebrows. But fearing that she will be timid, she sings "Cháo Tiān Zǐ" (another musical tune) and so on... In one scene, she takes one step after another, and the scene is extremely tense. Finally, she performs various stunts such as hair twirling, somersaults, and falls in succession, while stabbing the tiger and singing "Let him be shattered to pieces, let him be crushed into dust, ah Fei Zhen'e, what a pity for your great talent, ah! It's wasted." This indicates that it is a pity that she did not die to kill the traitor, and as a result, she died herself. Chuanfang's performance is outstanding and appropriate, and it is wonderful to watch!</p>
<h3>Secret History of the Imperial Palace of the Former Capital (7) (1)</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>The Landlord of Luoma Lake is named Ma</p>
<p>These descendants who enjoy the inheritance of their ancestors, although their behavior is slightly better than Li Pei, the practice of setting up private courts, bullying the people, and raping women continued unchanged until the Republic of China. When people in Xuzhou mention the Ma Family Village, they still treat it like the "Xi Huang Zhuang" (a notorious landlord family). They harbor many gang leaders in their village and raise their own opera troupe, called the Ma Family Troupe. Their manner of doing whatever they please is truly repulsive. Unexpectedly, the Northern Expedition in the fifteenth year overthrew the power of the warlords, and at the same time overthrew the local tyrants and evil gentry. Therefore, Party workers reported all their crimes to the Special Court of the Capital. Only then were they arrested in Nanjing and detained for more than a year. Later, they were released due to a special amnesty. Although they were slightly restrained, their nature as bullies and evil gentry remained unchanged. Now it is said that they have become traitors, using the power of the enemy to oppress the villagers of Pi and Su counties. Therefore, the remnant poison of the monkey Li Pei in the early Qing Dynasty still exists in the Ma family clan of Luoma Lake.</p>
<p>Che Gao Gong excels in the art of changing faces</p>
<p>In Peking opera, the singing of "Zhaoguan" is the most complicated, because it is not only a one-man show, with little time to rest, but also the huqin (Chinese violin) goes up and down, sometimes Xipi, sometimes Erhuang, after singing several Erhuang sections, then singing Xipi Erliu and Yaoban, back and forth. If the voice is a little bit worse, you have to open your mouth to sing it through to the end. Moreover, there is no fast tempo in Erhuang, but in this play, the two segments of "Having something on my mind, hard to close my eyes" and "The rooster crows and the dog barks, it's five o'clock" after the third watch and the fifth watch, have more than twenty sentences in total, all of which must be completed in one breath. Although it is called a "glance of Erhuang" (meaning the original tempo), there is no place to drop the drum mallet at all. When singing, you can only use the board to measure the rhythm, with no space to breathe at all. Sometimes three words are sung on one board. If you encounter a person with a big tongue or someone who doesn't speak clearly, then they will definitely stutter like they burned their tongue eating pulled silk yam.</p>

<p>Letter received: Regarding "Yi Hua giving up Jin Suqin", (omitted) many people in the film industry knew about it at the time. I submitted a manuscript to your publication, and I have no other intention. I am deeply afraid of misunderstandings, so I hereby solemnly declare. Yours sincerely, Editor, Xin Shi</p>
