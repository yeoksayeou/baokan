<p>社評</p>
<h3>英國對遠東能否中立？</h3>
<p>英日兩國間的東京談判，預料在明日，即十五日，便可開始。英國方面，至今主張這决談判以有關天津的地方事件爲範圍。日本方面，要求「英國確定在中國戰事中，嚴守中立」，爲進行談判其他一切問題的先決條件。這幾點，無從證明其必然；且想像談判的前途，或妥協，或破裂，或無結果，或發展至預定以外的境界，種種可能，眞是不一而足；然歸納倫敦東京兩地最近的消息，所傳要旨，不外乎此。</p>
<p>關於東京談判，本報已經屢次加以評述；到目前爲止，我們自覺往日所論不謬，亦即不再有申論必要。今天祗就所謂「中立」，請以最中立的見地，檢討日本所要求的先決條件，英國是吾亦有接受的餘地。</p>
<p>所謂中立，祇有在法西斯聖經中別具妙諦；假定日本所要求英國的中立，以法西斯聖經爲範疇，則惟有一笑置之，不値得論列；何況根據法西斯精神，英國在遠東祇有延頸就戮，以『尊重和平』的資格，根本沒有嚴守中立的資格。故今日日本還要求英國嚴守中立，則所謂中立的意義，非依法西斯妙諦，却從一般解釋。</p>
<p>從一般解釋中立，以國際所公認的國際法原則爲標準。依國際法，必先有國與國經過正式宣戰的手續而交戰，於是確定爲戰爭的主體；與主體相對稱的，即係所謂中立。遠東戰爭，已經兩年，但主動用兵的日本，至今多所顧慮而不敢宣戰；故一面避免了交戰國在國際法的責任，一面享受了非交戰國在國際的正常權利；同時，當然不成其爲戰時國際法上的交戰主體。然則所謂嚴守中立，何從說起？在英國，更沒有表示中立的理由與必要。</p>
<p>國際聯盟沒有解散，英國沒有退出國聯；不必說英國在國聯組織中負有異常的責任，即以英國爲國聯的普通會員國而論，英國亦有遵從國聯盟的及一切決議案的義務。國聯對於中日戰事，旣判斷了曲在日本，又稱日本爲侵略國，且屢决決議會員國應儘所可能援助中國。凡此種種鐵案，說明了日本不但對中國作戰，并且對整個國聯以及國聯會員國彼此對立。因此之故，英國對於中日戰事，不容許表示中立；亦即沒有聲稱保持中立的權利。</p>
<p>在上述國際法與國際聯盟之外，再從實際利害上研究中立：大凡對於國外的戰爭狀態嚴守中立，意義在乎採取中立的方式，衛護本國的利益。換言之：倘若戰爭與本國利益無關，則守中立；倘若中立而仍得衛護本國利益，則守中立；倘若利害有關，衛護無術，但得恢復利益於戰爭之後，則守中立；倘若戰爭影饗及於利益而決心放棄利益，則守中立。凡此各種情況，無一適合於中日戰事中的英國，故英國不能守中立。倘若英國此際聲明嚴守中立，則中日交戰的雙方之中，旣無一方對英國負有代打仗的義務，即不問最後誰勝誰敗，都沒有將中立的英國原有利益交還英國的義務；故聲明中立，完全等於聲明放棄利益，完全等於聲明退出遠東。權利與義務，相依爲命，盡若干義務則享若干權利，有若干權利則負若干義務；這是公道，這是眞理。對侵略加以幾分限制，則必保得幾分安全。對艱難困苦的抗戰者，饗以冷酷的中立，則抗戰之後，痛定思痛，必報之以更冷酷的感情。對抗戰者始終十分熱情，十分援助，則抗戰者必始終十分感念其友誼，十分尊重其權利。這全是公道，全是眞理！</p>
<p>英國在東京談判之中，是吾接受日本所要求的嚴守中立，英國朝野必能善自盤算，而不待他人曉舌；但我們從旁觀察，深信英國決不接受此項要求。至於所謂日本以此爲先決條件，尚非日本負責當局的正式聲明，故亦不必視爲萬分確定。萬一雙方對此一點，相持不下，則我們以爲決非長此僵持，決非沒有下文的談判破裂；遷延又遷延，別成境界。</p>

<h3>英法政府發出新訓令　答覆蘇聯要求三點　談判中當可解除若干困難</h3>
<p>（倫敦）關於英法蘇聯三國現行談判情形、英國內閣於今日舉行會議、當卽核准新訓令、日內卽可電達駐蘇聯大使西慈爵士、俾得與蘇聯外交人民委員長莫洛托夫賡續進行談話、同時不國政府亦將以新訓令電達駐蘇聯大使那齊雅、按蘇聯外交人民委員長莫洛托夫、最近所提出之要求、厥有下開三項、（一）「間接侵略」界說問題、（二）在正式簽訂互助協定之前、先行成立軍事協定、（三）蘇聯必俟波蘭與土耳其兩國向該國提供保障之後、始能對瑞士荷蘭兩國予以保障、英法兩國政府之新訓令卽係答復以上三點、內容如何、未經發表、但其大要已由哈里法克斯外相面吿蘇聯大使邁斯基、此間政界人士均謂英法兩國自談判開始以還、卽已表示妥協精神、蘇聯政府倘願賡續進行談判、自應表示同樣精神云、（十二日哈瓦斯電)</p>

<p>（倫敦）關於莫斯科三國談判、倫敦各報論調多表示黯淡、惟「泰晤士報」獨抱樂觀、該報申稱、莫斯科談判現時已逹决定階段、若干爭執之點、均已解决、其癥結在保證波羅的海各國一事亦經獲得同意、卽德國倘欲攫取波羅的海各國一致、蘇聯感受威脅、抵抗侵略、則英法允以援助是也、該報以爲波羅的海各國、雖已申明抵抗外國侵略之决心、甚而對此項保證提出抗議、但此種保證、不致影響三國協定、因所謂保證波羅的海各國一事、根本係英法蘇三國間義務關係、於波羅的海各國本身之是否接受、初無若何重要影饗云、（十三日海通社電）</p>

<h3>義國特利哀斯脫港　特許德國利用　德國得設航空根據地　並建立海軍造船廠等　蒂羅爾省禁止外僑居留</h3>

<p>（巴黎）英法政界觀察、義政府此决在蒂羅爾驅逐外人出境舉動、顯示羅馬柏林軸心將採取進一步軍事行動、權威方而認爲該項舉動即德國在鐵利斯蒂設海軍根據地之先聲、查該處原係奧國在亞得利亞海之海軍根據地、據非正式報告、義方已允予德國在鐵利斯蒂特別權利、但主權則仍屬義方、換言之德國已可直接進人亞得利亞及地中海、（十三日美聯社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）關於義國政府勒令蒂羅爾省外僑出境事、英國大使館曾向義國外交部有所探詢、但其理由何在、迄未明瞭、據聞義國地方當局係奉內務部之令行事、並非驅逐出境、而爲禁止居留、凡屬外國遊客須於四十八小時內離境、而下居已久之各國僑民、則予以各種便利、惟於財產如何補償、及禁止居留期限之久暫、現尚無法獲悉、此間某某方面以爲、義國蒂羅爾省對於日耳曼人之撇退辦法、實施頗多困難、義國當局殆不願外僑獲見此種情形云、（十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）據今日此間發表之公報、義大利此决驅逐南蒂羅爾地方外僑出境之行動、係因接獲秘密警察關於波爾柴諾省內某數西歐各國人士之報告、故此舉實屬政洽及軍事上之理由、英法等國外交代表之來赤旗宮訪問、僅係探詢情形、並非提出抗議、即或有之、必將予以拒絕云、（十二日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）義國政府勒令各國僑民退出蒂羅爾省事、頃由共產黨機關報人道報加以評論、略謂、「德國意欲佔據勃倫納山隘、其調動軍隊運輸軍械之事、已爲外僑所見、德義兩國當局爰乃遷怒於彼輩、查德國已於六月間遺派陸軍兩師、開入義國、一爲機械化師、現駐義國里維拉省與法國邊界相距匪遙、一爲步兵師、業已調至北菲洲義屬里比亞殖民地、此外、尚有大隊士兵、均携有殖民地裝備而集中於輿地利省、菌斯勃魯克與格拉茲兩城、行當經由勃倫納山隘、開入義國、轉赴里比亞殖民地」云、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）義國政府聞已决定將「巴黎午報」暨「巴黎晚報」駐羅馬訪員狄伏驅逐出境、法國政府爰擬將「義大利日報」駐巴黎訪員波末驅逐出境、以資報復、按波末所發電報、往往具有激烈反法性質（十三日哈瓦斯）</p>

<h3>統一公債到期本息　在重慶貼現付款　準由中交農四行貼現　上海及各埠分六期付清</h3>
<p>財政部通吿今後關稅償債辦洗後、對統一公債七月底到期之本息、被迫暫行停止償付、惟爲維持債信起見、准由中·中·交·農·四行辦理貼現、歸重慶中中交三行辦理、上海以及各埠分六期付淸、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>關稅被截被迫停付</p>
<p>政府對於償付債務、向來按期履行、允以海關担保各款、從未愆期、自淪陷區域海關稅收爲日刦奪之後、仍由政府轉商中央銀行透支墊付、至去年底截止、已墊付積至一萬七千五百萬元、及至今年一月十五日、乃採取正當之措置、對總稅務司呈請照舊透支還債之辦法、不得已不再予以通融、如果嗣後稅收照舊解交總稅務司時、自當仍即同時照舊撥付各債賠款基金、</p>
<p>轉商四行貼現付款</p>
<p>款基金、財政部見、對七月底到期之統一公債本息、轉商中中交農叫銀行、予以貼現付款、今四行已允發給「貼現憑證」、仍由中央銀行重慶總行及其委託之中國交通兩銀行憑「貼現憑證」在重慶十足付款、上海以及各埠則分六期付淸、每期爲一個月、與上决之統一公債第六决之重慶付軟辦法、完全相同、惟以前財政部所發給之「准匯憑證」、今已改爲四行所發給之「貼現憑證」、</p>
<p>準定月底重慶償付</p>
<p>新聲社向中央銀行上海分行詢問、對於統一公債之付款辦法、雖至昨晚截止、尙未奉到正式部令、但認爲由中中交農四行貼現付款、似係事實、至於七月底到期之本息、統一甲種爲七百八十五萬二千五百元、乙種爲五百七十一萬五千元、丙種爲一千一百九十八萬五千元、丁種爲二千零四十萬零五千元、戊種爲九百六十四萬六千元、總共付款五千六百六十萬零三千五百元、</p>
<p>證劵暗市猛烈回漲</p>
<p>上海證券暗市開拍、統一各債猛漲至烈、收盤甲種五十九元一角、漲一元二角半、乙種四十九元八角、漲九角、丙種四十八元三角、漲一元零五分、丁種四十七元六角、漲八角、戊種四十七元八角五分、漲一元一角、同時市塲因聞財政部已定付款辦洗、所以人心已安、預料今日開盤、續有漲勢、至於上海分六期付款、是吾付現鈔、抑係匯劃、須俟財政部之正式命令今明日抵滬後、方能明瞭、</p>
<p>復興八底金長抽籤</p>
<p>民國二十五年復興公債第七决還本付息、依照條例規定、爲八月三十一日、共付本息一千一百六十九萬六千元、已於七月十日由國債基金管理委員會抽出還本籤支、至於本息償付辦法、昨據新聲社記者向銀行界探悉、雖未奉財政部命令、但聞財部亦已定有辦法、叉民國十七年金融長期公債第十二决還本抽籤、已定九月十日舉行、計抽二十二支、還本四十萬零七千八百十二元五角、</p>
<h3>海關浮碼頭　靠輸辦法　郵船接客小輪限制停靠時間</h3>
<p>江海關港務長特貝克、昨致各輪船公司函云、茲爲免除海關碼頭各浮碼頭（外灘浮碼頭第九·十·十一號）之船隻擁擠、及增進羣衆登岸便利起見、特曾同南埠有關係之市政機關、訂立施行辦法如左、</p>
<p>各種小輪分類停靠　　一、第九號浮碼頭、專供海軍給隻、及進口郵船接客小輪停靠之用、二、第十號·第十一號·浮碼頭、專供下開各項船隻及工人之用、甲、載客小輪之裝載出口旅客至各郵船者、乙、非營業性質之各種輪渡、往來於外灘及各碼頭工廠公用機關等處者、丙、各碼頭工廠及其他實業機關之工人、上船及下船者、</p>
<p>特雇小輪停靠時間</p>
<p>再非沿靠第十號及十一號浮碼頭之船隻、須遵守下列各條規則、除眞正接客小輪、如斯各特第一號·曼麗馬勒·格茲拉夫引平·大來·以及其他特別租雇、用以裝卸各輪船旅客之小輪外、其餘載客小輪、沿靠該兩號浮碼頭之時間、以足敷上下旅客應用之必需時間爲限、不許超過、並不得停留於該兩浮碼頭之傍、等候載客、（其有按規定之時間表行駛者、於駛抵浮碼頭後與載客離岸前、其間每須躭擱若干時、當其完卸旅客後、須立即駛離浮碼頭、開往浦東陸家嘴停泊等候、待至重行裝客離岸時、再行駛往浮碼頭、裝載搭客、）</p>
<p>接客小輸遵守規則　　二、正眞接客小輸、（第一條內列舉之各小輪）應遵守之規則如下下甲、各小輪裝載出口旅客至郵船者、沿靠浮碼頭、祇准於其時間表內規定駛離浮碼頭時之前牛小時爲限、乙、各小輪在郵船停沿本口時、裝載搭客、往來於外灘及郵船之間、沿靠浮碼頭之時間、不得逾十分鐘、以上規定各項辦法、各船隻如有遠反情事、當取消其使用碼頭之權利、或由港務當局予以罰金之處分、</p>

<p>天津海關、認上海爲有霍亂傳染病疫港、駛津船隻、均須停大沽口外、聽候檢騐後進口、</p>
<h3>英對日在閩行動　將予强硬答覆　堅持英人有留局及出入全力　生命財產須由日方負責任</h3>
<p>字林報云、日本及川海軍中將、昨（十二日）經日總領事三浦而致文此間領事團、謂日方定七月十五日起、對閩省之泉州·銅山·與詔安·開始軍事行動、要求第三國一切船隻、包括軍艦在內、駛離三埠、因是日將於入口處安置障碍物、並請該三地之第三國僑民撤退、頃悉、英當局將予答覆、堅持英國人民留居及出入此等地點之權利、並將堅持英人生命財產及利益之任何損壞、須由日方負其責任、</p>
<h3>浦東偽軍反正　暴風雨中游擊隊乘勢推進　逼近大團南滙不足一公里</h3>
<p>侵入南匯大團等之日軍、喘息方定、不料游擊隊得浦南正規軍四十五旅之援助、與伏在近郊之部隊、同時反攻、丁錫山于陶生谷守信三部已聯合行動、據聞已在奉賢境獲取大勝、並由民團在泥城等處、抵阻日軍、同時「和平救國軍」亦已反正、而對江閔行滬閔路上僞警五十餘名、與關港徐新舟殘部改編之「護民軍」、亦於前日聯合攻擊閔行日軍根據地、此外高橋「北區自衛國」中、有一巾隊竟將該「團」僅有之重機關槍一挺、輕機關槍二挺、手提機槍一支、自動步槍一支、新式步槍十餘支、一併携出、於前晚由高行越上川路而至楊家鎭、宣佈獨立、並將陳少亭之「自衛團」歸併、聲勢陡漲、凡此種種、俱爲預有計劃的行動、日方變生肘腋、疲於奔命、前日大風雨、日軍陣地、均處逆風、失去威力、故所謂「掃蕩軍隊」均已阻滯不進、大團與南城、游擊隊乘勢進佔、近郊相距、不足一公里、</p>
<p>日軍猛犯大團激戰</p>
<p>華方爲統一指揮浦東忠義救國軍成爲勁旅起見、將何行健調回、另委靑年軍人徐志道氏爲特派員、負資整理指揮、徐氏業於上月底蒞浦、從事整理、日方認徐氏蒞浦、有大不利、故爲先發制人計、以南橋僞警反正、抽調千餘人、携輕重兵器、於四日晨起、猛犯浦東各地、徐氏亦率隊防堵、於是引起今决之大血戰、四日晨四時、日軍自周浦新塲、抽調所有兵力的六百人、携輕重機槍、山砲小鋼砲各二門、汽艇七艘、直犯大團鎭、當由顧繼明大隊長率領一小部份、在距離大團六里地方之閔家店、與良園一帶抵抗、一時砲聲隆隆、激戰至烈、至是晨八時止、</p>
<p>南城大團被炸情形</p>
<p>日軍於是役傷亡約三十餘人、顧隊死一傷一、日軍至此、頓呈不支之勢、即調轟炸機四架、輪流轟炸大團、全鎭一片焦土、救國軍化整爲零、散處各地、大團遂爲日軍佔據、下午日軍四架、飛往南匯城、投彈五十餘枚、城內民房、被毀甚多、民衆被炸傷亡達四十餘人、守城之忠義救國軍、乃在城郊附近抵抗、終以日機猛炸、南城亦淪陷、</p>
<p>大團收復旋復淪陷</p>
<p>五日下午、忠義救國軍即派有力部隊、反攻大團、日軍因四面被包圍、雙方接觸不多時、日軍即全部向南四面潰竄、大團途爲救國軍收復、迨至六日早晨、日複調來五百人增授、再行猛攻大團、雙方激戰數小時、終以日軍砲火猛烈、大團再吿失守、六日全日、浦東各地籠罩於日機偵察與轟炸之中、但忠義救國軍仍不斷乘隙襲日軍駐地、</p>
<p>戰事南移尙未展開</p>
<p>七日一時起、日軍數百、向黃家路攻擊、當由徐承德大隊長、率領部隊還擊、徐爲東北人、軍事學識、富有經騐、戰至七時、日軍死亡達廿四名、該項屍首、於倉忙之際、日軍均未及舁去、徐隊毫無傷亡、是役日軍、並遺棄步槍十餘枝、晨八時、日方復派機三架、飛往該處助戰、徐爲避免轟炸起見、即行退駐某地、俟機再謀襲擊、同時另一部息義救國軍、則現正在奉賢方面活動、故近日浦東戰事、已漸移至該處、但尙未正式展開劇戰、</p>

<h3>颶風在南京附近消滅　航運作吿恢復　又有新飆風迫近台灣　襲滬與否現不能預測</h3>

<p>英文大美晚報云、颶風昨日（十二日）在距滬四十哩處經過後、今日（十二日）侵晨起、本市陽光普照、洪水已退、聞台灣四週刻有另一颶風、航運專家以爲該颶風似亦將朝此方向而來、或適將於週杪抵達此間、航運恢復前日本市　遇飆風襲擊、航運完全停頓、昨晨雖颶風驚報解除、天氣晴朗、航運均吿恢復、進出口亦照常、故太古順天輪。怡和怡生輪。日輪大吉丸。靑鳥丸（昨誤大連丸）、昨晨已相繼進口、中日聯絡班上海丸。太古成都輪。意郵船康脫羅素號、昨日照常出口、前日因颶風拖曳上岸之舢舨、昨晨已一律下水、渣華新輪芝楂連加號、准今日下午叫時出口、聞意郵船康脫羅素號、此决由滬、回抵威尼斯後、即須准照海關規定、入塢修理、內郁加以髹漆、停駛一班、該公司即調派南菲綫之郵船Giulio　Cesare號、代替行駛歐亞航綫一决、下月二日自威尼斯起程來華之康脫凡特號、即改該輪來華、的八月二十八日抵滬、至康脫凡特號須移後一班、改於八月三十日自威尼斯起椗、</p>

<h3>準備檢委推定　匯劃證決緩發　行莊領用匯劃準備實施檢查　領用數額及擔保品分別公吿　錢庫參加票據交換辦法</h3>
<p>銀錢業同業滙劃凖備檢查委員會、業經各團體及四行推定、（一）上海市商會爲常務委員徐寄廎、（二）銀行業公會爲代理主席吳蘊齋、（三）錢業公會爲前任主席秦潤卿、（四）洋商銀行公會爲會長何伯司根、（五）中中交農叫行合推中央銀行業務局副局長胡梅庵、該委員會依照檢查規則、將實施檢查、並將領用數額及擔保品種類數額、分別公吿、以昭大信、</p>
<p>滙劃證書無需發行</p>
<p>各行莊領用新滙劃後、至於匯劃證、依目前情形、似無需發行、因現在市面上通用匯劃、仍以各行莊支銀行凖備會之支票互相收付、而錢業準備庫亦以委託代理交換方式、參加銀行票據交換所、票據淸算旣已集中一處、更無需匯劃證之發行、所以銀行準備會對匯劃證决暫緩發行矣、關於滙劃證之式樣、以及發行規則、現均已經銀行準備會擬定、如果將來需要時、仍予發行、</p>
<p>新滙劃制度之說明</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向銀行界探悉、各行莊所存凖備會庫之二千二百萬元匯劃頭寸、既經放出法幣、各行莊對顧客所支付之滙劃款項、勢必以擔保品向銀準會領用、例如甲銀行當日滙劃票據軋收三十萬元、乙銀行軋付七十萬元、在甲銀行即將該款存入銀準會作爲交換存款、在乙銀行則需提供値評價百分之七十財產、申請領用滙劃、此即所謂新滙劃也、</p>
<p>錢庫參加交換辦法</p>

<h3>夫婦間的心性是息息相關的</h3>
<p>我們嚴格的說起來，一對恩愛的夫婦，不能算是兩個人，而實是一個整體；因為他倆心理生理上息息相通的關係，實在太密切了。在夫婦間的日常生活中，對方的言語，行動，習慣。甚至速蘊藏在內心中的感懷與思想，均足以給對方以深刻的影響。至在夫婦主要關係的性行為中，因為內分泌腺素的交換，心性的溝通，他倆更如聯合着的一個人，簡直無分你我。明瞭了這一點，我們可以相信房中教妻，將勝過於母親對女兒的再三鞭斥，枕邊一席話，可以使浪子回心轉意，愛情的引力，真是何等的偉大！</p>
<p>家有賢妻，夫不遭橫禍，因為他的心，經愛妻溫柔而甜蜜的融化，一變粗暴為精細了。因此萬事可以消災降福，到處順利·不過，也有一些蠻不講理的丈夫，時常埋怨他賢慧的妻子缺少熱情，而不知這都是他自己弄成這個樣子的。一個發育不全或患有早洩陽萎的丈夫，他的慾念雖或和常人一樣的急切，甚至身虧慾旺，較常人更易衝動；但在愛的生活中，每屢次的虛偽地欺騙着愛妻，妻的熱情經屢次的不滿足後，於是逐漸的也就冷淡下來了。因為生理上的打擊，而發生種種病態者亦是很多的。所以夫婦有一方健全，决不能使他倆生活有益，甚至反有種種弊害；必須雙方均能健全，那才像魚之得水，有說不盡的歡暢融洽！</p>
<p>男子身體是本該健全無缺的，何為而有病態？這據醫學上的論斷，大都為早年犯有自　遺精或婚後的荒淫縱慾把生殖腺液消耗太多，那就新陳代謝减退，發育停滯，腦，脊髓，性三大神經衰弱，於是上述症象即不一而足。至於補救之道·據科學的醫學指示及余經騐，均以服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」最為對症特效。因此劑於服後一日夜間即能生精補賢，滋養神經，助長發育。上述症象即可根本痊愈·惟有遺精者須兼服「希米脫氏固精片」，以制止遺洩，則標本兼治，收效尤速！這是最近的事實。有嘉興人王一民君，年三十五歲，二十歲許有自凟遺精，二十五歲結婚，婚後即有早洩症，因此，夫婦愛情淡薄，雖曾有一女，但不久殀折，頃者不但早洩，間有遺精，幾至完全不能勃起，此物之小猶如田螺，並且精力疲乏，時有腰酸背痛，頭昏腦脹，年未四旬，而已老態龍鍾了，余即投於大量之「生殖素」及「希米脫氏固精片」治之（此項良藥中西五洲等大藥房均售）一星期後遺洩卽止，未及一月，卽面見紅潤，精力充沛，夫婦間愛情勝如新婚矣！</p>
<h3>遺精在伏天的對症療法</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>夏不藏精，秋必病瘟！</p>
<p>秋瘟之可怕，這是誰都知道的。所以夏令的攝生，有萬分重要。第一須注意食物的清潔，所謂「病從口入」。萬一吃了帶有病菌的東西，那就疫痢隨之，非常危險！第二須節慾保養，夫婦間的房事應减少，更不宜有自凟遺精，如果遺精不止，則精液的流失過多，身體的抵抗力减弱，那在此夏季，不特易染疫痢，並且因新陳代謝的减退，發育作用的停滯，以及腦，春髓，性各部神經的衰弱之故，那更頭昏腦脹，健忘失眠，虛汗盜汗，腰酸背痛，滑精漏精，早洩陽萎，發育不全等症象接踵而來，此種青年，在此暑熱的夏天，簡直是奄奄一息，茍延殘喘而已，一至秋後，秋瘟流行，小者耗費時間與經濟，大者一病嗚呼，亦是常事！所以患有遺精者，在此夏天是切不可放任的。訪求最對症而特效的療法，實為急切而刻不容緩之圖，據世界名醫之千萬病案及余多年經騐，均以服「希米脫氏固精片」，確為最對症而特效。因此藥於服後一日夜間即能鞏固精關，鎮靜神經，使夜得安眠，减少夢幻和盜汗，則遺精可於當夜立止。如已有上述症象者，須兼服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」，以培補腦賢，增益精血，滋養神經，能繼續服用，必可於短期內根治上述各症，長服更能使身體益臻健康，患者若親來本診所施用電療注射等法，則收效尤速！</p>

<h3>乳峯是幸福的主宰者</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>杏靨桃腮正華年，</p>
<p>丰乳肥臀極態妍，</p>
<p>夫壻多情兒活潑，</p>
<p>逍遙快樂似神仙。</p>
<p>世界上最幸福的女性，自然要算體格壯健，身段婀娜，乳峯高聳，臀部　腴的健美女郎了。她們一方面因為自己的姿態生得漂亮，所以無論跑到親戚家里，朋友所在，以及交際場中，受着人人的讚揚與尊敬，佔到許多便宜與快慰。而一方面回到家里以後，丈夫又是含笑相迎，待她十分多情，活潑的子女，更　衣跳躍，呼母索食。家庭里充滿着熙熙融融的喜氣，而她更是笑口常開，快樂無旣。這不是世界上的活神仙嗎？不但此也。而且此種女性，因自身的生殖腺卵巢機能健全，新陳代謝作用旺盛之故，所以芳齡雖然漸增，而她艷麗的面容，與　娜的姿態，依然還是俊俏動人，昔人所謂『駐顏有術』，在我們醫學上言之，其實就是總綰全部腺器的生殖強盛的人，自然可以不老不衰，青春長駐。生殖腺萎弱的人，在女性方面最顯著者。便是乳房萎　，臀部瘦削，肌肉枯槁，性感淡薄，此等女性，不但因姿態的醜陋，不為人所重視。即在夫婦之間的性生活上，尤易引起丈夫的憎惡心，結果其命運必非常悲慘！欲謀補救，祇有信賴科學，據世界婦科名醫康德林，及法國美容專家威泥基博士等臨症實騐結果。均公認以服卵巢製劑女用『生殖素』最為對症而特效。蓋以劑係由雄壯動物的生殖腺卵巢精華製成，故服後一日夜間即可培補卵巢機能，旺盛新陳代謝作用，調整月經，暖　止帶，如繼續服用，不特能使萎　的乳峯，在短期內立顯高聳，同時且能促進姙娠機能，增加血素，紅潤面頰，化醜陋為嬌艷。</p>

<h3>電療在治淋上之新價值</h3>
<p>在近十年來，淋病療法上，確有飛躍之進展，而理學療法方面，尤有長足之進展。以理學療法中之電療而言，始則採用波長，繼而發見長波電療，在某種塲所，尚不能發揮其殺菌之特長。於是更進而研究改良而發明短波，在應用與殺菌的效率上，誠非長波所及。但在某種塲所，仍有缺點，而長波則仍有優點之存在。故長短波電療於淋病治療法上，如輪相輔，不可偏廢，但兩者之缺陷甚多，不可備舉。因此對於電器械之本身上，經一般學者不倦地精進研究，益見進歩。以現在一般醫家所用之電療而言，多失之陳舊，殊不足合吾人理想上殺菌之效力。因之一般淨猾淺識之流，一概抹殺，未免太過。因現在確已發明最合吾人理想之電療——濾淋平流電療法。</p>
<p>濾淋平流電療，是德國電療界中最新之發明。其透射與殺菌力，恰到好處。無過與不及之弊。能將急慢性淋病淋部之淋菌，加以澈底之掃盪。故歐美各大花柳病院，無不有濾淋平流電療機之設備。自濾淋平流電療發明而後，電療在淋病的治療上已有新的估價，余十數年來之經騐，在電療中要以濾淋電療爲第一。如能詳察病情，而輔用對症療法，如攝護腺炎之輔用按摩，關節炎之輔用希氏血淸，自能限期根治。因濾淋電療既能殺菌而濾淸淋毒，而血淸又能撲滅血液中之淋菌也。</p>

<h3>金融　外匯期貨供過於求　沙遜雖結終見鬆動掉期買賣數額頗巨</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市況、匯豐掛牌、悉無變動、英美匯暗市、現貨仍見呆定、毫無生動、交易則非常清稀、紙洋行界略有結款、顧外行供塞殷切、故結果未有變動、而期貨七月、雖西商沙遁力扒先令、兼日銀行與華商紗花帮先後吸收美滙、但因外行賣意亦佳、允以美進更濃、再則華行亦曾來了結美匯、致結局遂呈英平美略帶硬之象、此乃受英美匯兌上漲之故、而八月份期貨、雖沙遜亦來頻吸、及華商紗花帮稍有購納、然以外商銀行拋出頗多、且華行會來吐售、是以結果略見鬆硬、回復上日原價、叉七八月份掉期交易、某行會貼予富商套利者、美金四三七五、的合月息（除佣）三分五釐之譜、但此乃爲有鉅額頭寸者、若在少數則祗肯貼出三七五、全日期貨交易尙旺、至港滙買賣相埒、終則無變化、</p>
<p>交易期貨居多</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近期長一八七五、遠期升一二五、紐的銀價未更、倫敦生金亦無上落、匯兌英對美大三釐、對滬昂一二五、對法仍平、美對英漲〇六二五、對滬勿動、對法大〇六二五、中央掛牌各匯如舊、（已停止中請）銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金六辦士五六二五、美滙十二元七八一二五、較之前收、均無榮辱，開後洋行首來扒結滙豐現貨英金六辦士五六二五、兼叉結進美行現貨美滙十二元七八一二五、市况極形平靜、迨滙豐掛脾揭曉、悉無變化、白銀平衡稅揭曉依然免徵，此後因外商銀行界對於期貨賣意愈濃、互相競塞不已、雖西商沙遜與日銀行等咸起扒結、但不爲所動、致市勢略鬆、計滙豐賣予西商沙遜本月份英金六辦士四六八七五、及八月份英金六辦士二五、繼而某行亦塞予沙遜八月份美滙十二元二一八七五、時有利與荷蘭亦相繼吐予日行正金本月份美滙十二六二五、將近午刻、曾有鉅額掉期買賣、計某行塞出本月而套進八月、貼予富商套利者美金四三七五、的合月息（除佣）三分五釐强、然對一般少數套利者、某行紙肯貼予美金三七五、約合月息（除佣）仍爲三分光景、其時英行滙豐再塞予沙遜八月份英金爲六辦士二六五六二五、後美行大通賣予洋行現貨港匯價仍四十四元一二五、爲狀乏變、延至午收、銀行現貨賣價、英美匯均與晨開無異、本月份英金六辦士四六八七五、美滙十二元六二五、八月份英金六辦士二五、美滙十二元一八七五、</p>

<h3>買風籠罩下　金價邁步前進　二千六百元收盤交易祇四百餘兩</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、續前邁進不已高達二千六百元收盤、蓋港帮納胃良好、加以散户多頭興趣濃厚、監視嚴密、雖銀樓帮與證券帮相繼塞出、無如頭寸供不敷求、致結果又續漲八元且中途一無迥逆、市象簡爽、交易平淡、全日紙四百餘兩、銀樓飾金掛大一元、海關金與中英純金等呆定如故、</p>
<p>烚赤再好入元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開因港方客帮叉委託某銀樓代爲吸購、市勢堅穩、開市即做高一元、首由某銀樓吸進錢兌業五十兩、價二千五百九十三元、繼又進同業五十兩、價九十四元、俄相同價錢兌業亦吸收銀樓帮五十兩、後又抬高一元、某金號進某銀號五十兩、價爲九十五元、時一度沉寂十一點後、港帮複來吸收、且某錢兌業亦有納胃、瞬息於買風籠罩下　竟抬高四元、某金號獲利復吐予某銀樓五十兩、及證劵帮塞予某錢兌業五十兩、價均九十九元、午刻又升一元、某銀號復進證券帮五十兩、六百元爲午收價、午後市勢平靜、雖某銀樓再起吸收、無如同業等供意尙佳、致乏變化、計某銀樓吸進錢兌業二十兩、及同業五十兩、價均六百元、此後買賣均懷觀望、市况亦平、延至三時未見做開、故晚收價仍作二千六百元、結果較隔昨又漲八元、查巳連漲四天、共計二十三元、全天七元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價二千六百零五元、收進二千五百九十五元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、據詢鮮少做開、</p>
<p>飾金掛大一元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初均未更、迨至十時五十分、因烚赤又步高八元、致亦掛大一元、計大同行改懸二百六十三元、新同行爲二百六十一元、收進二百五十五元、</p>
<p>純金呆定如故</p>
<p>十二日倫敦電、英純金每盎斯仍呆定於七鎊八先令六辦士、致中央銀行之各行市價、亦呆而不動、計中國現金收買價爲一千二百十二元三角、掛牌海關金爲二元三角九分六厘、上海標準標金價爲一千二百零七元六角、</p>
<h3>外幣市價　昂於匯票</h3>
<p>昨日英純金未動、英美滙兌升一二五、本埠外滙、洋行結款甚殷、外銀行供給暢達、市價穩定未更、給赤開盤、客戶需要甚殷、市價爲二千五百九十三元、嗣人心堅俏、購者紛紛、現金號供給未暢、市價緩步上漲、頗少回旋餘地、午收爲二千六百元、下午交易趨稀、供求勢均、市價堅定未更、結果較上日續漲八元、外幣英美金鎊、供給未暢、且烚赤堅挺、市價俱趨上升、英美金票、交易頗盛、外幣市價較滙票昂貴、可見大富購買外滙、小富購買外幣、外幣供給終未暢、英金票平、美金票徵升、香港票法郎票荷蘭票等、需要俱殷、上升雖微、頗堅挺有力、難有回風、日金票供給較暢、市况稍弱、晚市爲九角九分六厘、朝鮮票需要殷、晚市爲八角八分五厘、公會交易未盛、鎭興出長泰進美金票三百元、又出福和祥進美金票二百元、又出永豐進美金票二百元、叉出勤泰進美金票三百元、昨日市價、英金鎊升一角、美金鎊升一角五分、美金票升一分、香港票升二厘、法郎票升五毫、新加坡票升二分、荷蘭票升一分、安南票坎拿大票斐律濱票各升二分、德金票升三分、僅英金票羅比票義大利票等未更、</p>
<h3>貼現略升</h3>
<p>昨滙劃票據貼現率、略見上升、每千元上午做高至九十四元、午後始稍回下至九十三元半、比前日升起一元半、錢業公會拆息未更、早午兩市均一角八分云、</p>
<h3>大條續長　印銀再縮</h3>
<p>十一日倫敦電、銀市印度續來吸納、投機家進出不一、供者較少、市面平穩、收盤後仍平、印度照掛牌價復來羅購、但出者大致均無供意、大條銀近期續長一八七五、遠期亦續升一二五、紐的銀電、美現貨未更、叉孟買銀電、市况穩中帶疲、現貨跌三安那、七月縮五安那、八月降七安那、成交單祇百張云、</p>
<h3>紗花　粗紗銷路復起　港滇兩帮辦去一千餘包　新廠出品依然無人問津</h3>
<p>紗市續見上升、漲勢迂緩前進、良以實需又複起色、華南滇帮粗紗納胃暢爽、港帮收買廿支雙馬特金城、十二支·二三支金雞大發等紗、的計七百六十五包、連雲南帮買去共計一千一百二十包、有此巨量現貨成交、人心常然安穩一步、市氣爲昂、至於新創紗廠之出品、客帮旣缺需要、而情况冷落不堪、竟乏人問津、售價與熱門貨之距離依然很遠、單就申新二·九·廠之出品天女·雙馬、現已貴賤相差殊夥、二十支雙馬現貨價爲四百八十四元、二十支天女僅售四百七十元、拔開十四元、查汕頭未失守之前、天女價高過七八元、可想市價之升降、根據消費之多寡關鍵爲重大也、</p>
<p>現紗情形晨初開盤、市情鑒定、因廣東幫代廣西帮採辦、雲南帮亦有吃胃、市價旣穩且定、開價加二元、二十支雙馬外棧價爲四百八十二元、棧單價爲四百七十五元、中途均在安靜中、稍有一二元之進出、迨至收盤、再好二元、二十支雙馬外棧價爲四百八十四元、棧單價爲四百七十六元半至七元、查半日成交統計一千七百四十五包、行情二十支雙馬漲三元半、牧羊漲三元、十支粗紗亦堅定、廠方由崇信廠開出十支大發一百八十包、價爲四百零二元、叉十支特大發三十包、價爲四百零五元、又二十三支大發七十五包、價爲四百二十元、棉紗出口今日有一百三十五件運烟臺、三百四十五件運天津、茲將各帮口買去之額分列如左、香港　七六五　雲南　三五五內地　二〇　同行　六〇五統計　一、七四五</p>
<p>日紗市面稍有回好、因連朝下降之故、略見反動但實需依然靜寂、二十支月琴現貨價爲三百八十六·七元光景云、</p>
<h3>南通新棉　狀況甚佳　本埠交易杜絕</h3>
<p>新棉情形、茲據由南通抵滬者譚及該處新棉作情况、目前正在發芽之際、觀測生產狀况、尙稱不弱、較去年爲繁茂、不過時期尙早、以後氣候有無變化、殊鮮把握也東台一帶鹽墾中花苗美盛而蕃殖、將來如得天氣順遂、雨水調勻、豐收必在意料之中也、該處當地之陳花價値、亦至廉宜、細絨棉紡二十支紗以上之原料、僅售五十元外、尙係（司馬秤）、不過頗不易輸運外出、且某方禁止出口、更見雷厲風行、至鄕問存貨未斷、然受游擊隊統制、不准離境、亦無法運出耳、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市昨日又呈疲乏之狀、開盤先因海外賣出、及多頭了結、跌一至七磅音、農部定於明日召見美國各大棉商、共同作棉花津貼之精密及最後之檢討、因之各同業對棉市暫抱觀望態度、昨日印度連同預測跌一羅比、埃及跌十餘磅音、</p>
<p>本棉交易杜絕、廠號全無做開、大概受金融緊急之故、至於蘇北來源、受颶風侵襲影響、輪船停止行駛、故碼頭上仍無到貨抵滬云、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日前暫無展開可能、除非銀行鬆動接受押款、俾使金融略可鬆動、如此則雖無大量交易、則亦可略有小額之零星交易矣、</p>
<h3>絲茶　海外絲價漲　上海絲無正市</h3>
<p>國外絲市、昨美日同告回升、橫濱現貨開出一二二〇元、漲二十七元、達期一一四四元漲二十元、紐的近期漲三分半、遠期漲二分半、現貨日絲各漲四分、上海絲售原盤、沉靜已久之絲市似又轉向活躍、</p>
<p>本埠絲市、外銷日有零星擋頭、上海廠絲則幾久無進出、目下買賣多屬錫絲、輯里絲六個號子售價一、二〇〇元、無榮辱可言、邇來亦無大批成交、蓋目下上海絲商咸無敢拋遠期貨、現貨交易銀根又緊、故絲交未能十分暢達也、印莊絲近甚靜、絲價疲軟、反之內地土絲價並不甚廉、且出運因難勒索亦巨、成本亦難壓低、在外銷市價未趨上游時、絲交自展開也、</p>
<h3>南北貨　新金針菜　隨到隨銷</h3>
<p>新徐州菜續到數十包、尙在報提中、但各帮聞訊、均有去胃、故已預售一空、行盤仍爲叫十元、趨勢挺立、預料後市非有大批到來、不易轉鬆、</p>

<h3>證券　忽因孔氏談話　公積突然興奮</h3>

<h3>柴霍夫逝世三十五周年</h3>
<p>— 歐之譯</p>
<p>安東·巴夫洛維赤·柴霍夫一八六〇年一月二十九日生於湯崗洛格。在一八八〇年他便開始文學事業。同時並在地方醫學和民衆學校方面努力。柴霍夫的文學技巧不斷的臻於完善，名聲迅速的傳揚開來。九十年代他已經是歐洲聞名的小說家了。一九〇〇年，他和托爾斯泰及科羅林果齊名，被當選爲名譽學術家。一九〇二年，他爲表示抗議沙皇不批准高爾基的當選，示威地把這稱號拒絕了。一九〇四年七月十五日，在沉重而長久的疾病之後，這個偉大的藝人不幸逝世了。</p>
<p>在最初的幽默小說裏，柴霍夫便已經以庸俗的熱情的舉發者底姿態出現簷。高爾基說：「在他之前，沒有一個人能這樣無情而忠實地描寫出人們在市儈底昏暗的日常生活。」隨着歲月，隨着創作的發展，柴霍夫愈加深刻的揭發了八九十年代俄國生活底吾定的方面。</p>
<p>知識份子底思想的空虛和沒有根據，人民主義世界觀底破產，市儈底耀武揚威，貴族底敗落和資產階級的興起，改良農村社會的矛盾，官憲底昏庸和橫暴的壓迫！這便是柴霍夫的題材。</p>
<p>專制把俄羅斯驅逐到四面碰壁的絕境。起初，柴霍夫看不見這絕境底出路。但，漸漸地，他對於改造生活底實現性鞏固起來。他說。「假使每一個人在他自己底一塊土地上做他所能够做的一切，那末我們底大地是多麼美好啊。」</p>
<p>晚年，他更加明白，只有反對社會罪惡的勇敢的鬥爭，才能够改變生活。</p>
<p>柴霍夫最所喜愛的文學形式是短篇小說。同時他也創造了許多非凡的戲劇作品（「海鷗」，「萬尼亞舅舅」，「三姊妹」，「櫻桃園」等），這些劇作，他稱之爲「抒情的喜劇」。</p>
<p>柴霍夫底創作在俄國和世界文學的發展中，展開了新的一頁。托爾斯泰說，柴霍夫是一個藝術家，決不能拿他和以前的俄國作家相比：「柴霍夫有他自己印象主義者的形式。看上去，這個人似乎毫無選擇地在抹着顏色，……走遠去，看一看，在總的方面，便得到了一個奇怪的印象。原來在你底面前却是一張明朗的，無可非議的圖畫。」</p>
<p>柴霍夫寫作方法底影響，對於俄國，歐洲，美洲底作家都非常之大。柴霍夫是一個方式美的作家，據高爾基說，他是難於被人模仿的：「文學底未來的歷史家論到俄國語言的發展，必定說，這語言是普希金，杜格湼夫和柴霍夫創造的」。（譯自蘇聯文學歷）</p>
<h3>花店及信</h3>
<p>— 劉蘭</p>
<p>一個下午，和朋友走進了花店。我茫然了，如誤入陌生的街道。什麽樣的花是茉莉？是丁香？紫的？白的？Forget-me-not多悅耳的名字呵，是那一朶呢？朋友自顧自的挑選着，終於揀中了一籃紅玫瑰，說是預備送給一位將結婚的友人。</p>
<p>詩人愛用玫瑰花來象徵愛情，但，對於肯思索的人，這說法恰是不祥的預示。美麗的花不是最易謝落嗎？從落英裹我們會體味出遭遇的可哀的。幹嗎要在靑春的心上罩上一層陰影呢？</p>
<p>走了出來，我說：「這花還算逗人歡喜」。朋友說：「非常可愛」。一隻如柴的枯手伸在我們跟前，一張菜色的臉喃喃地訴說着，討要足够買個大餅的錢。多殘酷的諷刺呵！「活在這城市裏，有一天，人會變瘋的。」我說。「對於人生的陰影面該有正視的勇氣，憤慨的背後，需要抗爭來支持。不然，再漂亮的激憤言語也是空的」。朋友爲我解釋，</p>
<p>隔一天，寄來封信：</p>
<p>「那東紅玫瑰的鮮艷的顏色，引起我對牠的同情。可是，當我記起，郝祇是些被折下的花朵，早就失去了生命和自由，我又開始厭惡牠起來。夢想着叢生在野地裏的花，牠們才是幸福的，不是關閉在暖室裏，把冬天點綴成春天；却在一個流浪者的心上，輕輕地抹上一絲希望和溫暖」。這幾句話說得很動人。</p>
<p>誰願意做暖室裏的花朶呢？風暴正緊，適者才能生存。享受與自由之間，該有所抉擇。但，得先把眼光看到遠方呵！可憐的近視眼患者！不，我要說活該。</p>

<h3>談往（下）</h3>
<p>— 可山</p>
<p>遺史曰：……已寫推舉狀革，但空姓名未塡，衆皆議未敢發，左司員外郎宋齊愈自外至，問時雍舉誰？時雍曰：「金人令吳开來密諭，意舉張邦昌，」今已寫下文字，未塡姓名，齊愈因記金人先有文字云：「請舉軍前南官」。謂是張邦昌無疑矣，乃取筆書張邦昌三字將示，時雍日：「是」。又示衆議官，皆無語。乃於寫下文字，填寫張邦昌姓名，別寫申狀，分無付與吳开莫儔，齊文字出城而去」。</p>
<p>這幾段對當時推選的情形，寫得非常生動，使我們回憶到已國初年建威將軍陸建章包圍國會，強迫選舉袁世凱爲大總統的情形來。於是，太宰張邦昌要做皇帝了。</p>
<p>遺史：「是日早，文武，百僚，僧道，軍民等會於尙幣令廳煎，時吿報軍前，奉冊寳人門，金人遺五十餘人素騎數百從之，邦禺自尙書省慟哭上馬，自西府門佯爲昏債欲仆，立馬少蘇，複號泣。午時導引至宜德門外閥門下馬，入幕决，又慟哭。有金人曾太師下五十餘人，持御衣紅傘來設於幕决，邦昌更帝服，少頃出步至御街褥位，望金國拜舞，跪受冊賣文冊日：「無德而王，故天命假於我手，當仁不讓，知歷數在於爾躬，咨兩張邦昌即皇帝位，國號「大楚，」都金陵。邦昌御紅織，還次訖，金人揖邦昌上馬出門，百官導引如儀，……於御牀西側別置一椅，坐受官員等賀訖，文武合班，張乃起立，間門傳旨云：「勿拜！」時雍等復奏，傳指揮云：「木爲生靈，非敢竊位，如不聽從，即當歸避」。時雍率百官遽拜，張急回身，面東拱手以立。</p>
<p>張邦昌的慟哭，昏　，欲仆，號泣，都是應有的做作，但在跪受冊寳文的時候，似乎很安靜：會編又引別錄說：</p>
<p>邦昌價立，呼拜迎引，皆金人爲之，初拜，幫昌爲禮，一金人提其領，謂京城人曰：「看此一官家，一似前來底」。邦昌入內，金人皆辭出，有衛士曰：「平日見伶官做雜劇，每假裝官人；今日張太宰却裝假官家」。</p>
<p>還有百官推戴張邦昌做皇帝的時候，照例得有一張勸進表，那表是軍器少監王紹打的稿子，會編說：</p>
<p>王紹表先敘大金皇帝云：「道合三光，功高九有，德淳允元，智將幾於處帝，第民伐罪，義實過於周王。」去敘邦昌云：「惟大蒙宰相公，職探天人，學貫今古，內外之聲久著，天人之意允乳，應大國褒崇之禮，希前王至盛之功，可治國事，以主斯民。</p>
<p>這樣的文章也很妙，可見一劇秦美新魏受禪表那些文章，已不能專美於前了，但不知今後還有比這更好的文章沒有？</p>

<h3>紅鬼子瓦西卡</h3>
<p>— 高爾基著　狄周譯</p>
<p>「哭是不會哭的！……麗達邊笑邊答。</p>
<p>『老板娘，把道些爛汚貨趕開去……她們來這裏來……幹麽！』</p>
<p>『你怕嗎？」麗達俯身向他，問道。</p>
<p>『下去，大家都給下樓去！……』鴇母命令着。</p>
<p>她們跑下去了；但是她們一邊走，一邊各自回過頭來不吉利似的望了望他的臉。但是麗達靜靜的說：</p>
<p>「走吧！」</p>
<p>阿玖斯尼亞還舉起拳威脅他說：</p>
<p>『啊！惡魔！這下怎樣——可不是磨了角嗎？……活該，活該！……』</p>
<p>她的大膽呌大家非常吃驚。</p>
<p>在樓下她們全陷在放蕩的喜悅，復仇的歡喜，和未曾嘗過的猛烈的愉快的旋渦中了。在歡簷的她們，大聲駡着瓦西卡，連鴇母也爲她們狂亂的氣氛吃驚起來，而受了她們的感染。</p>
<p>鴇母也很歡喜看到瓦西卡這種遭遇。她也很討厭他，因爲他在她面前不像一個使用人，（簡直像長官對屬僚，像主人對下手人那樣的手段對付她。）但她知道如果沒有他，她便吃不住妓女們。她小。的把自己的感情和瓦西卡說明。</p>
<p>醫生來了，紮上了紗布，開了藥方，臨走時還丟下一句說：最好還是讓瓦西卡進醫院。</p>
<p>『喂，大家怎麽樣？不去慰問慰問我們的寳貝病人麽？』麗逮勇敢的呌。</p>
<p>於是她們笑着喊着一起走上去。瓦西卡正閉着眼躺着，聽見聲音便眼也不張一張的說：</p>
<p>『們又來了麼？……』</p>
<p>『現在我們是來慰問你的唷，瓦西卡·米諾內支……』</p>
<p>『誰愛你們這些慰問？』</p>
<p>『記得嗎？從前你是怎樣對待我們呀！……』（八）</p>

<p>上海中國職業婦女俱樂部徵募夏令難胞衛生經費主辦物品義賣特刋</p>
<p>— 徐寄廎題</p>
<h3>發刊詞</h3>
<p>抗戰以後，在有錢出錢，有力出力的口號下，全國民衆曾以萬分熱烈的情緒，獻納了他們的財和力，盡着國民應盡的義務。不過，「年來各地同胞，因受戰事的破壞與影響，以致傷亡殘廢，流離失所，啼飢號寒，失父傷母的不知凡幾。」而「這種殘酷浩刧，久已引起國際友邦人士的同情，不斷給予寶貴的援助。那末，誼屬同胞的吾人，自應作更進一步的援助了。</p>
<p>但是因了「過去滬地人士，關懷全國被難的同胞慷慨解囊，節約捐款的確是很多，但因我們逼處孤島，收入有限，長期的現金捐騐，總感有些不易，同時由於代收手續上之繁難，以致不能普及於大衆，為着使得每一樂於捐輸的義士仁人，盡他的所有和可能，從捐贈或買進的物品當中，都能完成「　惠難胞的善舉起見。」於是，在五月底，我們决定舉辦物品慈善義賣會，準備把有錢出錢，有物出物，有力出力三個口號，在「義賣」中合在一起。</p>
<p>「義賣」在上海尚屬創舉，而本部仝人又皆力薄能　，所以籌辦數月，始見眉目，這是不能不歸功於本會各位贊助人的時時給予同人以熱切的鼓勵，及各公司商行的踴躍捐贈二點上的。本會義費所得，本來是須備捐作難胞一般用途，上月下旬，上海難民救濟協會為　募難胞夏令衛生經費，函請各社會團體組織勸募委員會，開始　募，我們因鑒於上海難胞人數並未减少，而夏令中叢居一處，最易發生疫　，對於社會的影響亦大，所以決定將此次義賣所得全部捐作難胞夏令衛生經費，這是應該附帶提及的，</p>
<p>在「義賣」即將開始的前數日，承本會各位贊助人賜予我們邇字，又承婦女界先進賜予我們文字，使本刋增加生氣不少，這是應該特別提出致謝的。</p>
<h3>職婦慈善義賣會感言</h3>
<p>— 黃定慧</p>
<p>職業婦女俱樂部係上海有名的婦女團體，集飽受高深教育，服務社會，各種職業部門的業餘姊妹于一堂，聯絡感懷，發揚互助，努力進修，與銀錢業聯誼會，華聯同樂會等，性質相仿，同樣的表現著國結進取的精神，一週年來的工作成績，會務的蒸蒸日上，殊足令人欣佩。</p>
<p>正當此炎熱的夏令，關懷著留離顛沛，虎口逃生，茍全性命于收容所中的難胞們，在憂傷悲憤之餘，再加以不十分充分之營養，身體抵抗力自然减少，時疫以及各種疾病易于傳染與　生，職業婦女俱樂部姊妹們，想盡一點風雨同舟的互濟責任，特發起物品慈善義賣會。徵求仁人善士，曁各大公司，廠商。慨捐物品，售價所得，除開支及少數捐助者抽回部份成本外，掃數捐助上海難民救濟協會，指定作難胞夏令衛生經費之用，職業婦女俱樂部姊妹們，見義勇為，博得各方面有力的贊助，籌備月餘，歷盡種種困難與阻碍，卒因慈善物品義賣乃正義善舉，獲底於成，但職婦諸姊妹辦事的熱忱，百折不撓，任勞任怨的犧牲奮鬥精神尤屬難能可貴。</p>
<p>先哲有言：惻隱之心，人皆有之，又云：人之好善，誰不如我，謹代災黎籲請社會賢達，閨閣名媛，聯袂　臨，共襄善舉，慷慨解囊，踴躍選購，惠而不費。節省我們一切暑季娛樂　冷飲消費，購買我們夏令一切必需用品，金錢旣不虛糜，更得助人自助的功德，又何樂而不為，為善最樂，願上海的諸姊妹，記取職婦諸姊妹的努力，急起直進，共盡同袍責任，</p>
<p>近來有時頗聽到一般人持反對救濟難胞的怪論調，他們的理由是：二年來的救濟工作，增長難胞的倚賴心理與茍且倫安的懶惰行為。不錯，難胞中難免不有良莠不齊，但絕對大多數是良善的，而且能忍受一切痛苦，不甘出賣靈魂作亡國奴，有高尚氣節的同胞，大批的他們正在努力學習一種技藝，大批的兒童正在受國難教育，我想稍有熱情的人士，都不忍袖手旁觀的，况且衆擎易舉，拿上海現時畸形的繁華，無節制的浪費而論，只需略加點綴，難胞便受惠無涯，况且時局未　，亦不應為德不卒，使他們再度流離失所，我們只有努力改善救濟事業，使　棲在各收容所中的難胞，學成各種技能，將來可以資獻他們的人力，來參與中華民國復興的建國責任，只有積極的改善，決無消極的取消，質之社會名達，以為何如？</p>
<h3>物品慈善義賣會籌備經過</h3>
<p>香港和廣州各地等小販們的義賣救難運動，上海八萬多難民的苦况，先後地激動了我們每一顆心。我們感到：救難該是我們上海居民最低限度的責任。照目前的情形看，單靠「節約救難」來救濟上海的，這力量還不够得很，一定要更廣泛地動員各界的人力，物力，財力，才能解決這問題。于是，在五月底，本會本着救難的熱誠，就發起舉行這物品慈善義賣會，想憑着許多會員的力量，廣大地推動滬上的工商廠號和熱心人士，來完成一個大規模的物品慈善義賣和義買。</p>
<p>于是我們就成立了一個籌備委員會，經這籌委會決定了物品慈善義賣的辦法：站在有物出物，有力出力，有錢出錢的立塲上，徵集各工商廠號或私人的物品，於規定的日期和地點，舉行公賣。為了使所有的物品有把握的成交，我們特於公賣前發售代價券，（券分五角，一元，五元，十元，五十元，一百元六種）至公賣時，買者可憑代價券十足兌貨。當然，現款購貨是更加歡迎的，義賣會全部收支，特請財務委員李文杰，李鴻壽等先生負責審核後，悉數救助難胞。</p>
<p>首先呌我們興奮的，就是當我們剛把義賣會的緣起，簡章等籌備妥後，就得到虞洽卿，林康侯，徐寄　等十五位先生的贊助，這使我們工作的進行，又順利了許多。</p>
<p>事情是愈快愈好，跟着六月的開始，每個會員都在『為義賣犧牲一切』的口號下，加速地活動起來了，徵募的人，每天帶着笑臉，走向各工廠，商號和各親戚朋友，為難民請命；生產的人一針一針不住手的把他們的汗和熱情交織在生產品上；其他保管和宣傳的人，也都盡力的工作着。一個準備在七月初舉行的義賣會，到六月底已籌備得差不多了。</p>
<p>但為什麼在六月底的申報上，又忽然出現了義賣會延期的消息呢？事情是這樣的：在六月底一次義賣宣傳的平劇播音席上很榮幸地來了兩位本會的贊助人。林　侯和袁履登先生，當他們也參加播送了幾曲平劇之後，他們還報告了一些關于勸募難民夏令衛生經費的話這些謠感動了我們，我們覺得難民夏令衛生經費的確是目前難民經費中最迫切的一項，于是，由鄉數人的提議，我們決定把這次義賣所得，指定撥充難民夏令衛生經費，這樣，我們一方面為了與上海難民救濟協會勸募衛生經費委員會取得合作，一方面更擴大籌備，所以，才把七月初的義賣延遲到了七月中旬。這一點是該向各界表示遺據的！</p>
<p>這次義賣所生產和徵募得的物品，我們約略地把它們歸納了九類：文具出版，藥品化裝，日用品，玩具，衣着，古董書畫，生產品，伙食，雜類。</p>
<p>最後，我們應特別致　的，那就是我們這次的義賣會，假如能有很好的成果的話，這功勞是該屬於本會的贊助人和參加這次議賣的各工商號的。因為在籌備的進行中，除了各贊助人不時地給我們幫助之外，各工商號參加的踴耀也是重要的幫助，目前單就大小，工商號參加的數量說，巴有近六十家之多，並且每一家所捐助的物品都是不抽回成本的！</p>
<p>義賣會已於今晨（十四日）在靜安寺路美國婦女俱樂部開幕了，因為籌備的急促，仝人能力的薄弱，缺陷是意料中的事，希望各界不吝賜教！</p>
<h3>從演「女子公寓」到義賣</h3>
<p>— 三石</p>
<p>我的認識「戲婦」，是着了她們的「女子公寓」後，是那樣認真的辦事，那樣認真的演出。</p>
<p>我的進一步認識「職婦」，是聽到了她們的籌備這一次，義賣為什麼？「女子公寓」，在我看來是她們的精神宣言，而這次議賣是她們的實踐。</p>
<p>而同時，又在我看來，從「女子公寓」到義賣，還不單單是宣言與實踐，而是代表著她們精神的不斷激進和她們的魄力。</p>
<p>為什麼？「女子公寓」說過「要代女子造一個理想的生活環境」，這次她們把這句話的意義擴大了，她門是從為婦女謀利益到為全民謀利益了，她們是折緊了目前上海急需　的一件工作，————來為難民請命了演「女子公寓」是她們一個團體在幹，這一次可把範團擴大。與各界通力合作來舉辦這義舉了。</p>
<p>「職婦」前面的路是什麼，她們已代自己揀定了，是從為婦女本身謀利益到為難胞謀利益。</p>
<p>這條路是偉大的也是光明的！</p>

<h3>夏令兒童健康園</h3>
<p>— （西蒙）</p>
<p>設備方面相當完善</p>
<p>收費太貴不能普遍</p>
<p>私立上海中學等四校所主辦的上海夏令兒童健　　，已於日前正式開幕，園地在成都路靜安寺路轉角私上中巨　，去年曾辦過一次，所以今年是第二屆了。</p>
<p>據說私上中主辦兒童健康園的主旨，在利用兩個月的假期，給兒童純良的空氣，充分的日光，滋養的食品，　以變換其兒童久處而習慣的環境，並調節其休息與活動，恢復其身心的健康。</p>
<p>除了每天上幾小時的課以外，就完全注重在課外的活動，在設備方面：運動有秋千滑梯，搖馬，軒輊板，攀登架，砂塲，溜冰塲，小球塲，籃球塲，健身房等；休息有茅亭，藤棚，樹蔭，凉傘，兒童坐椅，午睡室等；娛樂有音樂室，無綫電播音機電影塲等；衛生有　洗室，噴水浴池，砂濾器，晒水器，排水器，以及預防疾疫等；教育有圖畫空，兒童圖書館，兒童園藝塲，新聞板，教育板，及揭示板等；其他如禮堂，作業室，臥室，病室，餐室等，莫不應有盡有，設備是可算完善的了。</p>
<p>入　的兒童，所繳的費用是四十元，包括膳宿，營養物品，書籍，及理髪，洗衣等。自三歲以上，到十五歲以下的兒童，都可報名入營，額定二百名，自七月八日起到八月十七日止，一共是四十天。開幕的一天，入　的兒童已有一百五十多人了。按照年齡，分為幼童班，兒童班，少年班三組。所有的兒童，男女都有，祇是男孩比較多。服裝方面，男的齊是黃短褲，白短衫，女的西式便裝。床上所用的綫毯，草　，枕頭，也都由各兒童帶去。</p>
<p>在私上中的大厦裹，臥室是相當齊整而清潔。中午的時節，一般兒童都在屋子裹面讀書，看報，睡眠，休息。早上和傍晚，在操塲上面從事各種運動，游戲。這樣的生活，當然是有紀律的。健康　方面，除了有教導主任，保育主任，事務員等處理一切　務之外，更聘請著名中小學教師擔任教學指導，醫生及看護若干，日夜駐　，擔任保育工作，如督促衛生，診斷疾病等。</p>
<p>為了使都市兒童在兩個月暑假之中，轉換一個環境，增進健康，所以須要開辦兒童健康　，我們當然未可厚非。不過我覺得成都路靜安寺路轉角這樣一個環境，够不上算清幽，空氣未必新鮮，樹木花草壓根兒可算沒有，是不適於辦健康　的。加着入　着費每人四十元，平均每天一元，在一般的人看來，是相當高貴，尤其是在今日的情狀之下，中等以下的人家，決不有力量把兒女送進健康　去。那麼所謂健康的環境下，也祇有有錢人家的子弟才享受得到。這兩點便是美中的不足。</p>
<p>記得「八一三」之前，每年的暑天，由市社會局會同教育界及衛生機關合辦兒童夏令營。大前年，在吳淞同濟附中，前年在江灣高鏡廟嶺南中學，我都曾去參觀過。那些地方，才够得上算清幽哩。綠樹成蔭，空氣非常新鮮，四周盡是田野，孩子們過四十天的野外生活，當然可以增進健康。記得前年我到高鏡廟去參觀夏令營時，蘆溝橋事件早已發生，上海的空氣非常緊張，不到一星期，夏令營裹的男女兒童，就逃難到租界。相隔兩年，而今嶺南中學的校舍，已全毀於火，使人不勝今昔之感呀！</p>
<p>過往，夏令營的經費，一部分由各機關捐助，而每人祇十五元的入營費；就是十五元，在普通的人們看來，也嫌太貴，不能使自己的兒女入營。而今上海的教育當局已遠離了上海，由私人來辦夏令健康　之類，收費比以前高貴，是必然的。去年好像不止一個，還有兒童健康營，可是今年這健康營是停辦了，可見這都市中究竟沒有多少兒童能入健康之　啊！</p>
<h3>出力</h3>
<p>— 景宋</p>
<p>看到六月二十七大美晚報的「職婦物品慈善義賣特刋」，它號召我們「別逃避這有力出力，有錢出錢，有物出物的最低限度的責任。」它告訴我們最方便的義買，來幫助救濟事業。不錯，「愛人就是愛己，救難亦即救國。」而且那特刋也已經給我們知道：這　釀了半年的物品慈善義賣，為什麼經過這許多周折，到如今　能就緒。因為她們主持的各位太要好了，她們看到過去學生界，美術界，以及海關同人，和最近唐愛梅女士主辦的女子手工業展賣，都曾個別舉行過，但是還沒有大規模地聯合起來，使得這一運動的成績更好，意義更大，各方面都能够參加。</p>
<p>費了更大的力，於是在「職婦」義賣播音的時候，「益友社」和「華聯同樂會」等首先起來合力提倡，更得海上十多位熱心慈善事業的處洽卿先生等的贊助，和各界人士的熱烈指導，參加，這一運動，已經顯示出集體的力量了。</p>
<p>我們贊美「職婦」同人的熱忱，更萬分擁護她們「犧牲一切為義賣」的精神，和她們的口號：「為義賣而死」的毅力。以這種精神，這種毅力，來顯示我上海民衆救難的堅決意志，誰能不被感動的呢？我相信：香港義賣開始時，不過由一兩個小販偶然發動，就能够立刻蔓延到整個市塲，各商店，以至轟動全港。而我們上海，無疑地可能超越香港的成績。因為「職婦」的長久進行合法手續，艱難努力，籌備妥善，以及各界各名流，團體，商店，和兩租界當局的厚意贊助之下，一定會使這一義賣結出美滿的果實的。</p>
<p>慚愧是我自己，祇能從旁喊兩聲助助興，俗語說：「打鼓助興。」那就算是敲邊鼓罷，沒有力也算「出力」了。</p>
<p>比我力量大千百倍的多得很，比我熱心的也隨在都是。聽到各工商廠號的幫助，踴躍，如永安公司，商務，世界，開明各書店，各國貨公司，各藥房的紛紛捐助物品，真够興奮。「人之欲善。誰不如我」呢？我們不但希望捐物參加，還企盼陸續在各商店上也發起義賣，使這一運動更普遍，更不防後來者居上。先發起的也好，後參加的也好，分　舉行，聯合辦理，都一樣的好。我們祇計成果，不論花開先後。我們雖要收穫，但對先期辛勤的人們更覺感謝！大家是這樣的同心合力，不分彼此，就在這一次義賣看到萬衆一心，團結的力！</p>
<p>讓我們統一在「犧牲一切為義賣」的精神之下！以「為義賣而死」的毅力，來一致參加這一運動，舉起我們的手，齊一我們的步伐罷。</p>
<h3>女彈詞人物誌</h3>
<p>— 沈宥</p>
<p>馬如飛與女彈詞（下）</p>
<p>「陰盛陽　」和「方秋　魄」這兩開篇，是充分地反映了當時蘇州女彈詞的全貌，和女彈詞的中心人物。這些人物，最有名的是陸綉卿，方秋　，潘　雲等。就中以陸綉卿為最得時譽。她有「才」，有「貌」，有「　」，而且時常「出入常州吳縣兩衙門」，並「到處皆知」。如飛未刋稿中，還有「一張告示」開篇，寫的就是官吏們對陸綉卿着魔的情形：</p>
<p>一張告示貼姑蘇　女擋的書塲頃刻無　徐淑貞似笑還非笑　人緣到處有張羅　不住蘇州不在乎　陸綉卿三字招人愛　一曲琵琶一曲歌　引着官員着了魔　堂局六洋為正數　轉局三吊大青蚨　此番是滿載而歸返家途　汪雪卿喜把洋烟吃　好像夢里的西施差不多　方秋蟾會打蘇州白　常熟聲音半句無　沈　梅盡可為煤灼　曾與休寗朝奉去做老婆　居彩雲最愛輕年紀　勾引家中去碰和　暗中小旦常來往　朱春林兄弟見　羅　害他濃粉打扮去哭情哥　清官救命王菩蕯　喜煞那晴彈瞎唱的瞎婆婆　險些兒削髪去做瞎尼姑</p>
<p>無論如飛的嘲笑是否真實，但可以稱為最大遺憾的，是如飛對這些女彈詞的藝術，盡無隻字的批評。據這開篇說，陸綉卿是在蘇州　女彈詞後，飽載而歸。其實，這消息是不大可靠的，她實是跑到上海來了。所以「清　類鈔」里說：</p>
<p>咸豐時，有陸秀卿者，吳人也。避難至滬。貌為絕色，藝為絕技，人爭招致之。一曲八金。姍姍來遲，飄飄去　，名重一時。</p>
<p>此「陸秀卿」當即是如飛所說的「陸綉卿」。由這一綫索，可以推測而知道，女彈詞是起於常熟，初盛於蘇，被禁而後發展到滬，也逐漸的由「盲女」發展到「非盲女」。當女彈詞初起的時候，各方面是頗多反對者，當時的彈詞　　馬如飛就是一個，他不惜以四隻開篇來加以攻擊。然也就有賴於如飛的這一回攻擊，使我們　能得到如許重要的關於女彈詞的史科，得以了解上海女彈詞　起的前因，女彈詞從常熟到達上海的蘇州一段僑　的過程。陸綉卿來上海以後，彈唱　漸至有書塲。最初的塲子，大約就是王　之所謂「城內土地堂」。（本節完）（七）</p>
<h3>獨脚大盜</h3>
<p>— （燕華）</p>
<p>“Code　of　the　Secret　Service”</p>
<p>華納公司出品　大光明戲院映</p>
<p>勞納李根過去演過些新聞記者角色的影片，到最近，他却又在從事擔任所謂美國特務隊員的角色了。這一類影片，在形式上，可以說是過去西部影片和現在已不很時　的GIMAN影片的混血兒。</p>
<p>西部影片與GIMAN影片雖然已成過去，但那種搏鬥槍擊，與一種窒息的氣氛，却為觀衆所愛好的。</p>
<p>「獨脚大盜」便是這兩種影片珠混血兒。雖然整個影片，導演加了好多危險緊張，但因為故事寫得太單純，沒有伏綫，使整個影片失去了戲劇的氣味，因此，即使有搏鬥，槍擊等諸塲面，而它的緊張情緒，却不能連貫起來。因此，整個影片，也顯得　散而不够緊凑。</p>
<p>勞納李　的演技及表演的身手是還可取的，但沒有較好的故事，對於一個演員，實在是一個莫大的損失。</p>
<h3>聖俠拯美</h3>
<p>— （如華）</p>
<p>“The　Saint　Strikes　Back”</p>
<p>雷電華公司出品　大上海戲院映</p>
<p>「聖俠」這一個人物的出現，正和中國舊小說上的「俠客」一樣，他憑着矯捷的身軀，和他的武藝，專門路見不平，找刀相助，而自己却隱姓埋名，彷彿這個世界不屑他一顧似的。這世界果然充滿了黑暗，但是憑藉着這樣一個理想中的人物來「威風」一下，其實祇是「自我陶醉」吧了。</p>
<p>不過在許多「聖俠」的電影中，他往往揭破了那些假裝正經的人物的面具，使人們看清楚，包藏在他的燕尾服里面的是怎樣一付骨骼，這不能不說是劇作者的苦心所在。像「聖俠拯美」中的布立克律師，他就是匪徒華爾曼的化身。</p>
<p>本片的幾個驚險才蝗面，都不能處理得好，又因為綫索太多，導演者不能儘量描寫聖俠的機智。</p>
<p>飾「聖俠」的喬治山德士也沒有魯　斯海華（前任聖俠）的　着和機警。</p>

<h3>尚和玉的劇藝談</h3>
<p>— 張古愚</p>
<p>前幾天徐慕雲君的「梨園外紀」裹，把尚和玉談得非常起勁，不過徐君所談的都是屬於過去，至於尚老道（和玉）近年的一切一切，古愚曉得多一些，現在約略的談一談。</p>
<p>未談本題以前，我先來談些尚和玉與楊小樓長短的地方，尚氏寶坻人，為人穩重，不輕言笑，每遇坤角，必低頭合目，故人多以尚老道稱之。尚氏對於武生必習之穩準狠三字經，有絕頂功夫，是小樓不及也。惟小樓之聲容並茂，尚以蒼老之扮相，啞瘖嗓音，難免相形見絀。「麒麟閣」·「金錢豹」·「安天會」·「戰宛城」·「連環套」等劇，小樓優於老尚。其「麒麟閣」身上之好看，「金錢豹」白口之驚人，「安天會」身手之靈巧，「戰宛城」神氣之佳妙，「連環套」對口之清越，老尚不克臻此。但老尚之「拿高登」·「鐵龍山」之氣魄，「四平山」「惜猩猩」之精神，以及此四戲中拘臉之精細，小樓生前曾自嘆勿如。小樓老生戲是比尚為佳，老尚武凈戲（「葭萌關」張飛「戰宛城」典韋最出名）為小樓所折服。</p>
<p>尚氏年高於楊氏，楊在台上之精神，反遠不及尚，楊氏神氣之佳，真是世無其匹，尚氏工力之深，實為今後無人也</p>
<p>客歲僕與友人一度擬組新光，曾托津友面約尚氏，尚曰「一切條件可以不談，因為我真想再到一到上海，不過須以不搭洋船為先提。」毛病就出在他老人家不願搭洋船，目的人物吹了，新光之局，亦無形中冰消瓦解。</p>
<p>尚氏近年生活異常清苦，不過此老能安貧，小樓新故時，尚曾重整旗鼓！出演平津，聲勢頗盛，但不久即不為人　，上座慘淡，幾乎不能維持。但其雄心初不以和寡而磨滅，我友陳君，曾於尚氏出演天津中國大戲院時，訪尚於後台，尚氏曾謂「我們唱戲的，能够唱，應該多侍候你們先生幾年，唱不動了沒法」。</p>
<p>尚徒頗多，南方有楊瑞亭·林樹森（楊林且為尚之義子）天津有韓長寶·朱小義·張德發·婁廷玉·侯永奎·丁秉春，北平有一小武生黃元慶·楊瑞亭晚年的氣魄，確有暗合尚氏處，惟精神則相去太遠，林樹森學得頂多，同時也學得頂不像。韓長寶一切都好，尤其脚底下，可惜台風不足，神氣不現，久流江湖，兼染野氣。朱小義早年很好，因不知自愛，半途而廢，今且不知所止。張德發是武凈，去年一度出演本市天蟾舞台，「火燒余洪」是其佳奏。有尚氏之勇悍，而乏尚氏之穩練，兼且失之粗鹵，婁廷玉追隨尚氏最久，惜非良材，不足傅乃師衣鉢，今任天津小科班稽古社社長，侯永奎是崑　出身，身上武功都好，可惜眼上無神，嘴上乏勁，「五人義」「挑滑車」「鐵龍山」除白口多高湯口味外，（唱崑　多高湯人）頗多似尚氏處。且嗓子甚冲，此則優於乃師矣。此子事尚甚敬，尚亦頗愛其肯努力，丁秉春是武丑，乃掛名徒弟子也。至黃元慶是富連成小學生，武工甚佳，長靠擅長，惜其人始終不見長高，將來最多成一個韓長寶第二而已。尚徒自以侯永奎較有希望，此盛麟·楊盛春，左影為尚氏去年出演天津時由十日戲劇社攝影記者所特攝者。</p>
<h3>尚和玉之鐵龍山起全覇姿勢</h3>
<p>藝人漫筆</p>
<h3>壞人的話（中）</h3>
<p>— 王獻齋</p>
<p>（一）壞人做不得</p>
<p>我的從影史，始於民十一年。起先在明星「孤兒救祖記」中演一位名呌陸守敬的反派角色，是我認為頗具「經騐」而自請演這「壞人」的；　成後居然喜出望外，頗多溢美之譽；從此以後，便即無片不演「壞人」。每個導演人旣以為是「拿手好戲」，要我這般做法，我亦正中下懷，就最喜歡給那壞人來作活出醜的種種描　。</p>
<p>壞人這類角色，上自貪官　盜賊，流氓等諸般醜類，我都污吏，土豪劣紳，下至狡僕，　曾演過，而又演得很多。演出成績如何，那是另一問題。但於每個角色派定以後，我是都曾下過很多「實習」工夫的；如「啼笑因緣」中之沈三絃，到北平拍外景時，天橋那裹許多小茶館中，就去混過不少時候，而又結識了一位這類的朋友。「永遠的微笑」中飾一無賴酒鬼，那些下級酒店，亦是日常的去處，有幾次更一杯又一杯地，險些兒真的失了知覺。有些人的主張，演戲應該適合賞的個性，這話當然很對。可是像我站在演員立塲上的鄙見　，則又殊不盡然。以為一個演員的演技該是屬於多方面的上中下各級人物要能全部演好，才算是真正的成就；否則這不是人演戲而簡直就是戲演人了。關於這一點上，我雖離題尚遠，未能做到，而自己的心坎裹，却就從沒有放棄這樣一個奢望。</p>
<p>舞台上「曹操逼宮」中之華歆一角、以前常有大吃甘蔗橘子皮的危險；在激起觀衆反感的熱情衝動時是不免如此的。銀幕上常演「壞人」，也就有此類似的遭遇。我在上海跑在馬路上給人發現了，受及指指點點的咒罵那是「家常便飯」。前幾年在北平拍外景，也常有人「寃逢狹路」，對面大罵「媽特皮！壞蛋。」甚且汹汹然至有和我為難的神情；遇到了這些腦經簡單的「熱心朋友」，自己只能點頭賠笑臉，脚底明白，溜去完事；要如真和他們一般認真，顯見是會白吃眼前虧的</p>
<p>戰後到四川去度着一年多的流浪生活，我這「壞人」亦多處處碰壁，有苦難言。更可笑的是以前有一次打官司的事，對方當庭指出：「但看在銀幕上萬惡無道的表演，就可證明他决不是好人！」作為反證，更覺啼笑皆非，氣得無話可說</p>
<p>同樣當一個電影演員，反派角色在這一點上，是比較吃虧得多了。因此，我有這麼一個感覺：做人就該做一個好人，否則便係自絕人羣，結果是會「此路不通」，决無善果的。</p>
<h3>安秀麗丹當選性感明星</h3>
<p>— 新影</p>
<p>—報人筆人一致推薦—</p>
<p>一個身段生得很高；喉音帶沙，不能算十分美麗的得撒州姑娘，她那眩人的紅頭髪，而今帶上一個性感明星的王冕。她的名字就是安秀麗丹。本來好萊塢所公認的性感明星是琴哈羅，現在這頂帽子，却不加猶預的移到安秀麗丹的頭上了。這次安秀麗丹的獲選性感明星，是由於一般的明星，包括在敵對的影片公司中拍戲的明星，製片人，電影工作技術人員，脚本寫作者，理髪師，設計者，報紙及雜誌作家的一致公認，一致推薦。</p>
<p>安秀麗丹為什麼而獲得此榮譽呢？主要的原因，就在她走起路來，再沒有人會走得比她有樣。她面上時常帶著笑容。她的曲綫，她的沙沙之音，她的坦白，她的善於交際，會使一個非常剛強的人也被她誘服而拜到石榴裙下。她是一個很有生氣的女性，她參加美女競賽獲得優勝而後，打得撒州來到好萊塢。她是很直率的，承認自己被選為性感明星。</p>
<p>據安秀麗丹向人表示，她自己也不相信她時常有着性感的表現。她反對一般人所說性感是一種天賦，而後天不能造成的。任何人都可做到的。所謂性感，是綜合了美貌和個性，尤其重要的是健美，自然還得帶些幽默。安秀麗丹以為性感是一個人有着使人歡喜的質素，要知道人們怎樣才歡喜你，不要見人怕。使人想像到你在縛住他。</p>
<p>第二種重要質素，是在能够自覺。一個女人自己過分怕羞，會使別人也怕羞起來，結果不會有人和她拆趣。怕羞的結果會養成憑鈍。有時自覺的女人，偶然會想到男子的自覺要十倍於女子。最後安秀麗丹又指出成為性感女人的幾種秘訣：（一）不要因為一個男人同你出去玩了一次，不約定第二次出遊的日期而感到不快，因為你不一定可使每個人歡喜你。（二）另一面，他約定你第二次何日出遊，也不必過分的表示快樂。（三）一個男人，在不快時，你在他的面前，再不要狂笑。（四）不要忘記所有的男人，會想到女人綺麗得過分是危險的。（五）你不要以為靠自己單獨的力量，能成性感，主要的是在能誘服人而把握住人。（六）最後，一個女人，再不要去和男人討論性感問題。</p>

<h3>梨園外紀</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>徐碧雲觸犯梨園白虎之忌</p>
<p>山東人倒底性情忠厚，孟四爺囚見碧雲一時不能　演，恐怕他閑出病來，遂又暗中拿出一筆鉅款，教他同他們大爺（蘭園）合辦前外中和戲院，起先由別的角兒唱大軸，營業尚稱不　，足够敷衍開銷，後來為時稍久，他以為社會上或已把他以往的劣蹟忌記，遂竟大着膽子自掛頭牌，自唱大軸，那知營業反倒一落千丈，大不如前。有人說北平人自從他罰過苦力後，全都不齒其為人，所以大家就相率不願聽他的戲了。但據梨園行的迷信家講起，則又說「因為三隻白虎相冲，才把徐老四給冲　靈啦。所謂三隻白虎者，（一）中和園是故都惟一的白虎臺，（戲臺向西，南，北，三方者皆利，如東城之吉祥園係向西，前外門框胡同之同樂係向南，前外鮮魚口之華樂係向北，全城各園戲臺之向東者僅祇中和一家。因其房主為花兒匠薛某，本屬外行，且又性情拗執，故方有些特殊之白虎臺建起。梨園中入恒謂左青龍，右白虎，青龍主吉，白虎主兇，臺上之下塲門為青龍，上塲門曰白虎。當初老譚在世，迷信極深，每值堂會，或在某　第一日打砲，恒貼演「定軍山」劇，因他戲主角例由上塲門出塲，是劇則獨從下塲門上，所謂從青龍不從白虎也。其後叔岩富英亦仿而行之，由此可見梨園行是很忌諱白虎的了。）（二）碧雲的琴師喇嘛（趙繼羹）是白虎琴。（右手握琴，左手拉弓。）　碧雲自己有個小白虎的外號。（也有說他是屬虎的）本來一個白虎臺就足以嚇退許多名角不敢在中和演唱，何况主角同琴師又全是白虎呢。—（五九）—</p>

        <h1>1939.07.14</h1>
<h3>Large Numbers of Chinese Troops Gather Around Guangzhou; Chinese Forces Fiercely Attack Shilong and Taipingchang; Intense Fighting Also in Dongguan; More Than Thirty Japanese Motorboats Invade the West River, Hit Mines, Suffer Damage, and Retreat in Disarray; Chinese Forces in Northern Hunan Achieve Surprise Victory, Repelling Japanese Troops Harassing Junshan</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Foreign Dispatch: Intense fighting occurred along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway line last week. Chinese forces achieved two decisive victories. Currently, Chinese forces are fiercely attacking Shilong, and fierce fighting is ongoing. Taipingchang and Dongguan are also experiencing intense fighting. Along the Zhongshan border, Chinese forces are bravely resisting, inflicting heavy losses on the Japanese. The Japanese suffered excessive casualties and have completely withdrawn. Near Jiangmen, Chinese and Japanese forces are also engaged in intense fighting. Dieshi, west of Shiqi, briefly fell, but Chinese forces counterattacked and drove the Japanese back onto their ships. (13th Dispatch) (Guangzhou) This area acknowledges that a large number of Chinese troops are within thirty miles of Guangzhou. According to Japanese sources, Chinese forces are now concentrated in Zengcheng, Sihui, Conghua, Fogang, and Dongguan, under the command of Li Hanshun. It is also reported that 100,000 troops under General Bai Chongxi are preparing to attack Guangzhou from western Guangdong and eastern Guangxi. Zhang Fakui's Iron Army is also scattered along the upper reaches of the Beijiang River. Furthermore, Wu Qiwu's troops are gathering in the Dongjiang area. Undoubtedly, there are also armed Chinese soldiers within Guangzhou city, although they are labeled as bandits. In reality, they will rise up and conduct guerrilla warfare at any opportunity. According to foreign travelers, the areas occupied by the Japanese are rife with so-called bandits, while the areas under Chinese control remain peaceful and stable. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>Sihui: Although the number of Japanese troops in Jiangmen and Xinhui has slightly increased recently, they have consistently failed to break through. The Jiangmen and Xinhui area is still surrounded by Chinese forces. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Wengyuan: At 5:00 PM on the 11th, a unit of Japanese infantry and cavalry, numbering over 500, from Taipingchang, Conghua, harassed Yinxi Cave. Chinese forces intercepted them from multiple directions, engaging in fierce fighting until 1:00 AM on the 12th. The Japanese forces, unable to withstand the pressure, retreated in disarray along their original route, leaving behind dozens of bodies. Chinese forces seized a large quantity of military supplies. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Zhaoqing: At 11:00 PM on the 11th, a certain Chinese unit launched an attack on the Gualicun area of Jiangmen, engaging in a prolonged battle with the Japanese forces. The Japanese forces, unable to withstand the pressure, retreated in disarray. Chinese forces set fire to the nearby bridges and then withdrew to their original defenses. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Zhaoqing: On the 11th, the Japanese forces repeatedly attempted to invade Zhongshan and Pishi. Chinese defenders, together with local defense teams, jointly blocked and repelled the attacks. The defeated Japanese forces shifted their attacks to the Da Wusha, Zhuzhou, and Maxu areas of Xinhui. Chinese forces resisted with determination, repeatedly inflicting blows on the Japanese forces. The Japanese forces then repeatedly reinforced their troops, using superior firepower to fiercely push towards the Chinese forces. Maxu and Zhuzhou had no defenses to speak of, and were eventually captured. After occupying Maxu and Zhuzhou, the Japanese forces immediately began constructing fortifications, attempting to occupy them for a long period, in order to threaten Zhongshan and Pishi across the sea. They also dispatched motorboats to the Modaomen sea area, intending to clear the Chinese blockade. Chinese defenders are currently closely monitoring the situation. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Wengyuan: On the 11th, over a thousand Japanese troops from Qingkouling, Huaxian, engaged Chinese forces in fierce fighting in the Longhe area. By dusk, the Japanese forces, due to extremely heavy casualties, retreated in disarray along their original route. A small unit of several dozen Japanese troops was surrounded by Chinese forces. During the encirclement, four Japanese aircraft circled overhead, participating in the battle and covering the Japanese troops' breakout. On the morning of the 12th, over two hundred Japanese troops from Longkouling, intending to retaliate, advanced towards Pingshan and were intercepted by Chinese strike forces. (12th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Chongqing) Judging from the Japanese military's activities along the southwestern coastal areas of Guangdong, the Japanese seem to have the intention of encroaching on Beihai and Yangjiang. It is reported that the number of Japanese troops on Nanpeng Island (transliteration) and Weizhou Island has greatly increased. The number of Japanese warships patrolling the sea area in this area is also more frequent than before. It is reported that 600 Japanese troops have landed on Nanpeng Island and are constructing barracks large enough to house 3,000 troops, as well as installing artillery positions and barbed wire machine gun emplacements. It is also reported that the commander in charge of attacking Yangjiang or Beihai is Rear Admiral Kondo, who captured Shantou. (Associated Press, 13th)</p>

This unit attacked the Japanese forces in Beigang, Zhongfang, in two directions at dawn on the 12th, engaging in fierce fighting for half a day, killing over 400 Japanese soldiers and seizing many spoils of war. Furthermore, Junshan in Dongting Lake was recaptured by Chinese forces. The Japanese forces repeatedly dispatched motorboats to counterattack, causing one corner of the mountain to fall again. On the 8th, Chinese forces sent a team to clear the area, completely eliminating the Japanese forces. Junshan is currently under Chinese control. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Liuhuang: In recent days, the Japanese forces have repeatedly dispatched several transport ships to Shantou with reinforcements. Currently, the streets of Shantou are covered with slogans such as "Oppose England, Support Japan" and "Sino-Japanese 'Friendship', Oppose Communism," which are strikingly visible and ironically juxtaposed with the advertisements for opium dens and gambling houses.

<h3>British Newspapers Urge Civilized Nations to Swiftly Sanction Warlike Nations, Ban Imports of Certain Goods, and Fully Change Trade Routes</h3>
<p>(London) The News Chronicle here recently commented on the Sino-Japanese war, saying that it is regrettable that civilized nations have fully expressed sympathy for the Chinese nation's struggle against Japan's attempts at control, but have also allowed Japan to continue its aggression. This is a heartbreaking matter, both morally and materially. Since Japan is an aggressive country that disrespects the civilized world and has endangered the interests of all civilized countries around the world, if it wins the war and subjugates a corner of the Far East, aggressive militarism will inevitably intensify. The interests of Britain, the United States, and France lie in Japan's failure. Anyone who dares to say otherwise is truly insane. Civilized nations must immediately do two things: first, ban the import of certain goods from Japan, which can be ordered from other countries, even if the price is slightly higher. Second, make every effort to change trade routes. Half of the countries in the world are engaged in warlike activities. Those countries that hope for peace must find new paths and trade with friendly nations to ensure their own safety. (Havas Agency, 13th)</p>
<h3>Guerrilla Warfare in Henan, Hubei, and Anhui Again Achieves Victory</h3>
<p>Fancheng: Guerrilla warfare in Henan, Hubei, and Anhui has recently achieved new victories. (1) Six hundred Japanese soldiers attacked Sanfu Temple, Guangshui, on the 7th. Chinese soldiers and civilians jointly resisted, killing over 170 Japanese soldiers and seizing over 30 rifles, 11 horses, and many other military supplies. (2) Over 200 Japanese soldiers attacked Zhutangdian, Xinyang, on the 6th, encountering Chinese soldiers and civilians. Chinese soldiers feigned defeat. The Japanese soldiers, not suspecting a trap, went down to the river to bathe. Chinese soldiers then surrounded the Japanese soldiers, killing over 140 of them. Subsequently, over 700 Japanese soldiers were reinforced from Youhe, releasing toxic gas to retaliate. At that time, the Chinese soldiers and civilians had already completed their mission of attrition and had moved elsewhere. (3) At Kuzhukou and Da Guling, Huangmei, on the 5th, Chinese soldiers lured over 100 Japanese soldiers into the mountains and surrounded them, killing over 30 Japanese soldiers. (4) At Daqiaotou, Anqing, over 300 Japanese soldiers were ambushed in Ganlu Temple and Xiao'an Mountain on the 8th, killing over 60 Japanese soldiers.

Near the Xiama Ling area of Wanjiafu, one bridge was destroyed, nine Japanese road guard sentries were killed, and eight rifles were captured. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Ye Jianying Discusses Chinese Strategy</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) General Ye Jianying gave a speech to the newspapers yesterday, advocating that China's regular army should quickly establish the closest possible cooperation with the guerrillas. Ye pointed out that in the first year of the war, Japan advanced 1,800 kilometers with 20 divisions, while in the second year, Japan advanced only 300 kilometers with 31 divisions and 13 cavalry brigades. This proves that due to the difficulties of Japan's internal politics and economy, and the increased fighting power of the Chinese forces, the Japanese military's combat capability has gradually decreased. The reason why the Japanese military is unable to advance further is due to the activities of Chinese guerrillas behind the Japanese lines. This proves that the Chinese regular army should be closely linked with the guerrillas, launching simultaneous attacks on all fronts and in the Japanese-occupied areas, and coordinating with each other. It is believed that while the Japanese military is currently conducting large-scale "mopping-up" operations against guerrillas behind the lines, the regular army should attack the Japanese front lines to ease the Japanese military's oppression of the guerrillas. At the same time, the guerrillas should disrupt the Japanese rear transportation to help the regular army's actions. (Haitong News Agency, 13th)</p>
<h3>Chongqing Exercises Night Air Raid Defense</h3>

No air raid sirens were sounded during the exercise, and residents went about their business as usual. However, the authorities warned residents that if there is an air raid siren during the exercise, it is an indication that Japanese aircraft are flying towards Chongqing, and residents should immediately take refuge in air raid shelters.

<h3>West China Committee Allocates American Donations to Relieve Chinese Refugees; Cholera Isolation Hospital to be Established in Chongqing; Refugee Camps with Cooperative Farms to be Built</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) For the purpose of relieving Chinese refugees, Americans have launched a China Relief Society through the churches. Its purpose is to raise US$5 million in the United States to be used to relieve Chinese refugees. The main sponsor is US President Roosevelt, and other sponsors include the United American Church Relief, the United American Church Association, the North American Church Assembly, and other organizations.

<h3>British Military Attaché Spear to be Tried by Special Japanese Court; Members of British Parliament Repeatedly Question; Craig Continues Efforts to Secure Release</h3>
<p>(Beiping) In the case of British Military Attaché Colonel Spear's arrest by the Japanese authorities in Zhangjiakou in May, the Japanese side has established a special court and has agreed to conduct a trial. This news means that the case has been transferred to the special court for hearing, but the date of the trial has not yet been determined. The Commander of the British Forces in China, Major General Grasset, has been staying in Beiping. He has not taken any action or met with any Japanese officials regarding the Spear case. He returned to Tianjin yesterday morning and departed for Weihaiwei on the British warship HMS Falmouth in the afternoon. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>(London) British Foreign Secretary Butler stated in response to questioning in the House of Commons today that British Ambassador to Japan Craig is continuing his efforts to secure the release of British Military Attaché Colonel Spear. Labor MP Henderson asked whether the detention of a British military attaché, who enjoys recognized diplomatic privileges, by the Japanese army in Zhangjiakou is not entirely contrary to recognized procedures. Butler replied that in general, he thought so. Labor MP Benn then asked whether Colonel Spear will be handed over to a military court. Butler replied that a Japanese spokesperson had made this statement. The British government has instructed Craig to immediately ascertain whether this statement represents the views of the Japanese government. Labor MP Grenfell asked why Britain cannot detain Japanese representatives in this case. Liberal MP Sinclair asked whether the British government has proposed diplomatic talks with Japan regarding the threat of Colonel Spear's transfer to a military court. Butler replied that he thought it best to first ascertain whether the Japanese spokesperson's statement is endorsed by the Japanese government. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>(London) It is generally believed here that the Anglo-Japanese negotiations on the Tianjin incident will begin in Tokyo as scheduled on the 15th of this month. Although the Japanese side is willing to expand the scope of the negotiations, the British government is determined to limit the discussion to various local issues in Tianjin. Regarding the fate of Lieutenant Colonel Spear, the army attaché of the British Embassy in China, no news has been received. Some quarters believe that although Japanese Foreign Minister Arita has agreed to personally handle the matter, the Japanese government may use Lieutenant Colonel Spear as a "hostage" to influence the Anglo-Japanese negotiations.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Can Britain Remain Neutral in the Far East?</h3>
<p>The Anglo-Japanese negotiations in Tokyo are expected to begin tomorrow, the 15th. Britain, to date, has maintained that these negotiations should be limited to the local issues concerning Tianjin. Japan demands that "Britain confirm its strict neutrality in the Chinese war" as a prerequisite for conducting negotiations on all other issues. There is no way to prove that these statements are inevitable; furthermore, imagining the future of the negotiations, whether they result in compromise, breakdown, inconclusiveness, or development beyond the intended scope, the possibilities are truly endless; however, summarizing recent news from both London and Tokyo, the main points conveyed are nothing more than these.</p>
<p>This newspaper has repeatedly commented on the Tokyo negotiations; to date, we believe that our previous discussions have been accurate, and there is no need to elaborate further. Today, we will only discuss the so-called "neutrality" and, from the most neutral point of view, examine whether Japan's requested prerequisite has room for acceptance by Britain.</p>
<p>The so-called neutrality only has unique insights in the fascist bible; assuming that the neutrality that Japan requires of Britain is based on the fascist bible, then it can only be dismissed with a laugh and is not worthy of discussion; furthermore, according to the fascist spirit, Britain in the Far East can only stretch its neck and be slaughtered, and with the qualification of "respecting peace," it has no qualification to strictly adhere to neutrality. Therefore, if Japan still requires Britain to strictly adhere to neutrality today, then the meaning of the so-called neutrality is not based on the fascist mantra, but rather on general interpretation.</p>
<p>From a general interpretation of neutrality, the standard is the international legal principles recognized by the international community. According to international law, there must first be a formal declaration of war between countries before hostilities begin, and thus the subject of the war is determined; in contrast to the subject is the so-called neutrality. The Far East war has already lasted for two years, but Japan, which took the initiative to use force, is still hesitant and dare not declare war; thus, on the one hand, it avoids the responsibility of a belligerent country in international law, and on the other hand, it enjoys the normal rights of a non-belligerent country in the international community; at the same time, of course, it does not become the subject of belligerence in wartime international law. So, where does the so-called strict neutrality come from? In Britain, there is even less reason or necessity to express neutrality.</p>
<p>The League of Nations has not been dissolved, and Britain has not withdrawn from the League of Nations; not to mention that Britain bears an unusual responsibility in the League of Nations organization, even if Britain is an ordinary member state of the League of Nations, it also has an obligation to comply with the League's regulations and all resolutions. The League of Nations has already judged that Japan is at fault in the Sino-Japanese war, and has called Japan an aggressor, and has repeatedly resolved that member states should assist China as much as possible. All of these ironclad cases illustrate that Japan is not only at war with China, but also in opposition to the entire League of Nations and its member states. Therefore, Britain is not allowed to express neutrality in the Sino-Japanese war; that is, it does not have the right to claim neutrality.</p>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned international law and the League of Nations, let us further study neutrality from the perspective of practical interests: Generally speaking, strictly adhering to neutrality in a foreign state of war means adopting a neutral approach to protect one's own national interests. In other words, if the war is unrelated to one's own national interests, then maintain neutrality; if one can still protect one's own national interests while maintaining neutrality, then maintain neutrality; if interests are involved and there is no way to protect them, but one can restore interests after the war, then maintain neutrality; if the war affects interests and one is determined to abandon interests, then maintain neutrality. None of these situations are suitable for Britain in the Sino-Japanese war, so Britain cannot maintain neutrality. If Britain declares strict neutrality at this time, then among the two sides engaged in the Sino-Japanese war, neither side has an obligation to fight for Britain, and regardless of who wins or loses in the end, there is no obligation to return Britain's original interests to a neutral Britain; therefore, declaring neutrality is completely equivalent to declaring the abandonment of interests, and completely equivalent to declaring withdrawal from the Far East. Rights and obligations are interdependent; to fulfill certain obligations is to enjoy certain rights, and to have certain rights is to bear certain obligations; this is justice, this is truth. To impose some restrictions on aggression is to ensure some security. To offer cold neutrality to those who are struggling through difficult and arduous resistance, then after the resistance, when the pain subsides, they will surely repay it with even colder feelings. To be consistently enthusiastic and supportive of those who are resisting aggression, then the resisters will surely be grateful for their friendship and will fully respect their rights. All of this is justice, all of this is truth!</p>
<p>Whether Britain accepts Japan's requested strict neutrality in the Tokyo negotiations, the British government and public will be able to calculate well, and we do not need to persuade them; but from our observation, we firmly believe that Britain will never accept this request. As for the so-called Japanese claim that this is a prerequisite, it is not yet a formal statement from the Japanese authorities, so it should not be regarded as completely certain. In the unlikely event that the two sides are deadlocked on this point, we believe that it is by no means a long-term stalemate, and that the breakdown of the negotiations will not be the end of the story; there will be delays and more delays, leading to a different situation.</p>
<h3>Manchuria-Mongolia Border: War Escalates Again; Soviet Forces Shell the East Bank of the Khalkhin River; Japanese Forces Continuously Reinforcing the Front</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a Japanese newspaper report, war has broken out again on the Manchuria-Mongolia border. Two hundred Soviet-Mongolian tanks, supported by a large number of transport teams and covered by artillery fire, attempted to cross the Khalkhin River but were repelled. In aerial combat, eleven Soviet-Mongolian aircraft were shot down. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>Manchuria-Mongolia Front: Japanese suicide squads are attacking the remnants of Mongolian troops entrenched outside the Manchurian border. This marks the near-end stage of the conflict in this area. Artillery battles are still ongoing, with the Japanese attempting to destroy Soviet artillery positions. Simultaneously, Soviet and Mongolian forces are using machine guns and rifles to sweep the east bank of the Khalkhin River, making it difficult for the Japanese to establish a front along the Soviet-controlled area. A reporter, observing the Soviet artillery bombardment last night, noted that their shells landed with remarkable accuracy in the front lines and rear areas. A high-ranking Japanese officer stated regarding yesterday's developments that the conflict in this area is now coming to an end, and it is expected that 150 remnants of the Outer Mongolian forces will surrender today. The reporter, returning to Hailar in the same vehicle as wounded Inner Mongolian soldiers, learned that they were injured in combat west of Mount Haruna (transliteration) on Sunday. Since then, that area has not been attacked by the Soviets. Thirty-five miles from Hailar, along the road to General's Temple, the reporter saw several bomb craters, clearly the result of Soviet attacks at least two days prior. This represents the closest point to Hailar reached by Soviet aircraft. (Reuters Special Correspondent, 13th)</p>
<p>Hailar: A reporter recently inspected the front lines at Nomonhan for three days and toured various strongholds between Hailar and Nomonhan for a week, covering a total distance of 500 miles. Based on observations along the way, it is evident that the Kwantung Army's preparations are quite adequate and appropriate, and the situation is very tense. However, the Japanese have demonstrated the strength of their army and air force in the conflict. (Associated Press Special Correspondent Morris, 13th)</p>
<p>Hailar: Over three days, I inspected the various Japanese bases within 500 miles from Hailar to Nomonhan and witnessed the Kwantung Army's full preparation for the border conflict. Regarding Nomonhan specifically, the Japanese military strength, whether on land or in the air, is superior to that of the Soviets. As a result, the Soviet-Mongolian forces were decisively driven out of the area twice within six weeks. This may cause the Soviets to temporarily cease their provocations, but it is also a fact that the Japanese are currently unwilling to advance further. I have spoken with Japanese officers, soldiers, and airmen, as well as captured Soviet soldiers. I feel that the training, armaments, and morale of the Japanese army appear to be superior to those of the Soviet forces sent to the Nomonhan area. However, the Japanese claim that as many as 400 Soviet aircraft have been shot down by Japanese aircraft in the Nomonhan area, while the Japanese losses are only twelve, is not evident in my observations. At the same time, although the Japanese claim that there are no traces of Soviet troops on the east bank of the Khalkhin River, Japanese reinforcements and military supplies are still continuously being sent to the front lines of the Khalkhin River. Even as I and other foreign reporters returned to Hailar, Japanese heavy artillery was still being transported to the front. From this, it is evident that the Japanese are fully prepared for the Soviet attempt to retake Nomonhan. (Associated Press Special Correspondent Morris, 13th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to news from Chinese sources today, the Suiyuan Mongolian Political Affairs Committee is currently discussing what measures to take to cope with the emergency situation caused by the conflict between Outer Mongolia and the Japanese army. At the same time, more than 300 organizations in the city today also petitioned the government to explicitly commend the Mongolian people's heroic spirit of repeatedly defeating strong enemies. The petitions from various organizations mostly stated that the Mongolian people's war of resistance against Japan is of utmost significance. (13th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) When I traveled here by train from Hailar yesterday, I saw ten hospital cars filled with wounded soldiers. Although the number of Japanese casualties in this conflict is impossible to ascertain, at the Hailar train station, there were hundreds of urns containing the cremated ashes of fallen officers and soldiers, all waiting to be transported away. The outside of these urns was protected by wooden boxes, and hemp ropes were tied around the necks of the urns. My train also carried several urns, escorted by several soldiers. At each stop, local Japanese officials and Japanese community groups came to the station to pay their respects. (Associated Press Special Correspondent Morris, 13th)</p>
<h3>Northern Route慰問団 Presents Banner to Chiang Ting-wen; Over 5,000 People Participate; Situation Extremely Solemn and Enthusiastic</h3>
<p>(Xi'an) At 5:30 PM on the 12th, the Northern Route慰問団, in front of over 5,000 military and civilian representatives from the city at Xi'an's Xincheng Square, held a flag presentation ceremony to General Chiang Ting-wen, Commander-in-Chief of the 第口 War Zone, and all his officers and soldiers. The situation was extremely solemn and enthusiastic. Zhang Ji, the head of the 慰問団, presented the silk banner inscribed with the four characters "軍威大振" (Greatly Enhance Military Power), personally written by Chairman Lin, to Commander Chiang. At the same time, he presented the group's慰問金,慰勞品, and慰問 letters to the soldiers at the front line of the war zone, which represented the nation's compatriots. Then He Zhonghan, the head of the Northern Route, delivered a speech, saying that the soldiers of the war zone were fighting bloody battles in the front line, protecting the country, and fighting not only for the independence and equality of the Chinese nation, but also for the peace of the world. The banner inscribed with "軍威大振" by Chairman Lin was a sincere wish from the whole country to all the soldiers, and the large number of慰問 letters written by people from all over the country were also enough to express the high expectations of the whole people. He hoped that the soldiers at the front could bring out the spirit of Chairman Lin's inscription, greatly enhance their military power, and repel the Japanese army. Afterwards, Chiang delivered a reply, his tone extremely humble and inspiring. In addition to expressing his sincere gratitude, he declared in a very firm tone that all the soldiers of the war zone would (live for the Chinese nation, die for the Chinese nation), hoping that the delegation would convey this message to the officials and people in the rear.

<h3>Gulangyu Case to Continue Negotiations</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to Japanese sources, the reason for the failure of the negotiations between the Japanese side and the Gulangyu Municipal Council was entirely due to British interference. The land regulations are currently ineffective in the current environment, but the British side is determined to maintain the status quo and has also referred the Japanese side's requests, which are considered extremely reasonable, such as the appointment of a Japanese person to the position of Chief Inspector, to the Municipal Council Board of Directors next year for resolution. It is heard that Japanese Consul Uta Goro will continue negotiations with the Municipal Council in the hope of reaching a solution. (Associated Press, 13th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to Japanese sources, the Gulangyu Public Concession Municipal Council has rejected the Japanese demands for the appointment of a Japanese Chief Inspector and the employment of Japanese police to investigate Chinese "terrorists." These demands were made several weeks ago after Japanese forces landed, claiming that the Public Concession was a base for anti-Japanese movements. Subsequently, the Japanese restricted traffic between Gulangyu and the mainland, severely affecting the food supply within the Concession. (Reuters, 13th)</p>

<p>(Chongqing) The Economic Ministry's Central Industrial Experiment Institute recently sent staff to Zigong to study and improve salt production techniques and conduct experiments on extracting iodine and bromine from brine. In view of the fact that it is now the height of summer and epidemics are prevalent in various regions, and that the supply of medical-grade pure salt used for saline injections has been cut off from foreign sources, the Institute is using local materials and scientific methods to produce physiological saline. The purity and efficacy are very similar to that of foreign products. It is now being manufactured in large quantities and sold at low prices to meet the current urgent needs. In addition, the Institute has successfully produced pure sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, and ammonia and other chemical reagents upon external request, and has a large number of standardized products available for sale to various agencies and schools for industrial and chemical analysis.

<h3>British and French Governments Issue New Instructions; Reply to Three Soviet Demands; Some Difficulties May Be Resolved During Negotiations</h3>
<p>(London) Regarding the ongoing negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, the British Cabinet held a meeting today and immediately approved new instructions, which will be telegraphed to Sir Seeds, the British ambassador to the Soviet Union, within the day, so that he can continue talks with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. At the same time, the French government will also telegraph new instructions to its ambassador to the Soviet Union, Nagia. According to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's recent demands, there are three items: (1) The definition of "indirect aggression"; (2) The establishment of a military agreement prior to the formal signing of a mutual assistance pact; (3) The Soviet Union will only provide guarantees to Switzerland and the Netherlands after Poland and Turkey provide guarantees to the Soviet Union. The new instructions from the British and French governments are to respond to the above three points. The content has not been released, but its general outline has been told to Soviet Ambassador Maisky by Foreign Secretary Halifax. Political figures here believe that Britain and France have shown a spirit of compromise since the start of the negotiations, and if the Soviet government is willing to continue the negotiations, it should also show the same spirit. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<p>(London) It is heard that the British government sent new instructions to Ambassador Seeds in Moscow tonight. It is widely believed that the British and French representatives in the Soviet Union will hold another meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov in the coming days, and some existing difficulties may be resolved. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to sources close to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, France is unlikely to send military generals to Moscow temporarily to make contact with the Soviet authorities, as France believes that military talks can only be conducted after diplomatic negotiations have ended. Diplomatic sources confirm that the French government yesterday afternoon sent instructions to its ambassador to the Soviet Union, Nagia, ordering him to work with British Ambassador Seeds and special envoy Strang to continue negotiations with the Soviet authorities. (Haitong, 13th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the Moscow tripartite negotiations, the views of London newspapers mostly express dim prospects, but only The Times is optimistic. The newspaper stated that the Moscow negotiations have now reached a decisive stage, and several points of contention have been resolved. The crux of the matter, guaranteeing the Baltic states, has also been agreed upon, that is, if Germany attempts to seize the Baltic states, threatening the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union resists aggression, then Britain and France will agree to provide assistance. The newspaper believes that although the Baltic states have declared their determination to resist foreign aggression and have even protested against this guarantee, this guarantee will not affect the tripartite agreement, because the so-called guarantee of the Baltic states is fundamentally a matter of obligation between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, and the acceptance of the Baltic states themselves is not of any significant impact. (Haitong News Agency, 13th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to news published in today's evening newspaper, high-ranking French military officers will be ordered to go to Moscow immediately to have contact with the Soviet Chief of Staff. Although this statement has not been confirmed by official sources, political circles believe it to be true. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>(London) The negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union have been delayed and unresolved. When the House of Commons met yesterday, many members raised questions about this. When British Prime Minister Chamberlain walked into the House of Commons, opposition members spoke out before he could sit down. Members who supported the government remained silent to avoid making the cabinet ministers feel uneasy. A Labour Party member said, "The negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union have lasted for three and a half months. When the negotiations began, the Soviet Union seemed enthusiastic about concluding an agreement. The British government should now publish each proposal and counter-proposal, noting their dates, so that the public can judge who should be responsible for delaying the negotiations." British Prime Minister Chamberlain refused to approve this proposal, believing that it would not help the future of the negotiations. (Haitong News Agency, 13th)</p>
<h3>Italy Grants Germany Access to Trieste; Germany Permitted to Establish Air Bases and Naval Shipyards; Tyrol Province Prohibits Foreign Residents</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Echo de Paris newspaper recently published a shocking telegram from a correspondent in Zurich, Switzerland, stating that the Italian government has ceded the Port of Trieste (which belonged to the Austro-Hungarian Empire before the European War and was ceded to Italy after the war) to Germany for a period of ten years. The German authorities have also been granted permission to build wharves, docks, several naval shipyards, and an air base in the port. Large-scale construction projects are currently underway in the port, which is indeed the case. In the past, goods produced by Austria were mostly transported to the port for export via the "Vienna-Trieste Railway," so the economic status of the port was completely dependent on trade with the former Austria. Since the annexation of Austria by Germany, all goods produced in Austria have been rerouted for export through the German port of Hamburg, and the Port of Trieste has lost more than 1.3 million tons of cargo, suffering a huge blow. Now that Germany has obtained the port, it will become a Mediterranean country. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>(Paris) British and French political circles observed that the Italian government's move to expel foreigners from Tyrol Province shows that the Rome-Berlin Axis will take further military action. Authorities believe that this move is a prelude to Germany's establishment of a naval base in Trieste. This place was originally Austria's naval base in the Adriatic Sea. According to unofficial reports, Italy has granted Germany special rights in Trieste, but sovereignty still belongs to Italy. In other words, Germany can directly enter the Adriatic and Mediterranean Seas. (Associated Press, 13th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the Italian government's order for foreigners to leave Tyrol Province, the British Embassy has inquired with the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but the reason for this is still unclear. It is rumored that the Italian local authorities are acting on orders from the Ministry of the Interior, not expelling foreigners, but prohibiting residence. Foreign tourists must leave the country within 48 hours, and foreign nationals who have resided for a long time will be provided with various conveniences. However, it is currently impossible to ascertain how property will be compensated and how long the residence ban will last. Some sources here believe that it is difficult for the Italian Tyrol Province to implement measures to repel Germans. The Italian authorities are probably unwilling for foreigners to witness this situation. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<p>(Rome) According to a communiqué published here today, the Italian decision to expel foreigners from South Tyrol was made due to reports received by the secret police regarding certain Western European citizens in Bolzano Province. Therefore, this action is based on political and military reasons. The visits of diplomatic representatives from Britain, France, and other countries to the Palazzo Chigi were merely to inquire about the situation, not to protest, and if they did, they would be rejected. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Italian government's order for foreigners to leave Tyrol Province was recently commented on by the Communist Party's organ, L'Humanité, which stated, "Germany intends to occupy the Brenner Pass. Its troop movements and arms shipments have been seen by foreigners. The German and Italian authorities are therefore angered by them. Germany sent two army divisions in June to Italy, one being a mechanized division, now stationed not far from the French border in the Italian Riviera Province, and the other being an infantry division, which has been transferred to the Italian colony of Libya in North Africa. In addition, large numbers of soldiers, all carrying colonial equipment, have been concentrated in the cities of Innsbruck and Graz, and will pass through the Brenner Pass into Italy and then to the Libyan colony." (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Italian government is rumored to have decided to expel the Rome correspondents of Le Petit Parisien and Paris-Soir, Devaux. The French government is planning to retaliate by expelling the Paris correspondent of Il Giornale d'Italia, Bomel. The telegrams sent by Bomel often have a fiercely anti-French nature. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<h3>Britain Concludes Agreements with Greece and Romania; Extends Large Loans Separately</h3>
<p>(London) Britain and Greece have recently concluded an agreement. Based on this agreement, the British Overseas Trade Department will guarantee £2 million for Greece to purchase its needed goods from Britain. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>(London) An official statement was issued today regarding the British-Romanian agreement, stating that the British Board of Trade will guarantee the principal and interest of a Romanian government bond of £5.5 million at 5% annual interest, to be repaid within 20 years. This agreement contains provisions for Romania to purchase £75,000 worth of cotton yarn, wool yarn, and wool from British commercial organizations through regular commercial channels, and to facilitate trade and payment. The two countries will establish a consultation committee to consider the difficulties arising from this agreement. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<h3>German Commercial Delegation Sent to the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>(Berlin) According to a Berlin dispatch from the Figaro newspaper, the rumor that Germany is sending a commercial delegation to the Soviet Union has been confirmed. A delegation of German heavy industry representatives will depart within half a month. Business circles in Berlin say that Germany is willing to grant the Soviet Union commercial credit of over 75 million pounds for a period of two years. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) According to news from here today, Germany will soon begin negotiations with the Soviet Union. Dr. Wooltatt, the German Minister of Economic Affairs, is expected to go to Moscow in two or three weeks to negotiate a credit trade of 600 million U.S. dollars with the Soviet Union. Germany hopes that the Soviet Union will supply oil, ore, and timber. (Haitong Telegraph, 13th)</p>
<h3>Two Leaders of the Danzig Nazi Party Go to Germany for Instructions; German Armaments Smuggled into the City at Night; Polish Newspaper Discusses Ways to Resolve the Danzig Issue</h3>
<p>Danzig: The two leaders of the Nazi Party in Danzig, Forster and Zeisske, have both temporarily left Danzig, and things here have become more relaxed. Forster went to Bavaria, while Zeisske is in Berlin discussing future steps with the authorities and receiving instructions. Armaments are still being shipped to the Schichau Shipyard at night, and four Dutch-made ships are being formed into the core of a navy to deceive people. Two or three similar ships are being converted into possible mine-laying ships. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: Today, the "Polish Daily" published an article discussing the resolution of the Danzig issue through negotiations. The article stated, "If Germany agrees to abolish the League of Nations High Commissioner in Danzig, Poland will not object, because after the abolition of the League of Nations High Commissioner in Danzig, Poland's interests in Danzig will not be restricted. Poland is very willing to assist in improving transportation between Germany and East Prussia, but this expression by Poland does not mean giving up sovereignty over Pomerania. If Germany intends to negotiate, Poland is unwilling to make suggestions to Berlin first; Germany must first make the first move." (Haitong Telegraph, 13th)</p>
<p>Danzig: The Brazilian Chargé d'Affaires to Poland, Barbossa, and the Brazilian Consul in Gdynia, Cabral, were taken to the police station for questioning while taking photos in the street today. The Brazilian Chargé d'Affaires and Consul immediately produced their identity cards, proving their status as diplomats and consuls. The police station authorities immediately apologized to them, saying that junior police officers had to be very serious because the international situation was very tense, and therefore errors occurred. They hoped for forgiveness. (Haitong Telegraph, 13th)</p>
<p>Katowice: The German Drama Association in Teschen has recently been ordered to disband by Poland, and its property has been confiscated. The association's building is valued at 150,000 marks and has now been converted into a Polish theater company. (Haitong Telegraph Agency, 13th)</p>
<h3>German Army Organizes New Army</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Here, according to the regulations promulgated by General Brauchitsch, Commander-in-Chief of the German Army, a new army called the "Assault Detachment" has been organized. This unit will be combined with all cavalry and armored units, including tank regiments, anti-tank gun units, mechanized units, motorcycle units, cavalry, and bicycle units. (Reuters, 13th)</p>

<p>San Sebastián, Spain: Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, accompanied by Spanish Interior Minister Suñer, arrived here by plane from the port of Barcelona this afternoon for a close conversation with General Franco, which lasted for two hours. No communiqué was issued afterward, and the manuscript will be submitted to various newspapers tomorrow. Foreign Minister Ciano then attended a banquet hosted by Spanish Foreign Minister Jordana in the evening, and is scheduled to take a Spanish cruiser to the port of Santander at one o'clock midnight to preside over the inauguration ceremony of the Italian War Memorial there tomorrow.

<h3>British Reserve Fleet Participates in Exercises; British Prime Minister Announces in the House of Commons</h3>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons today that the government has decided to convene 12,000 retired naval officers, reservists, and pensioners on July 31 to participate in the fleet and air force exercises in August and September. In order to obtain the fullest benefit from these exercises and improve the efficiency of the fleet, arrangements are being made for the ships currently in reserve to participate in the exercises. The ships of the Home Fleet will be assigned to the Reserve Fleet. The King has agreed to review the Reserve Fleet in Weymouth on August 9. After the review, the ships will be prepared for exercises. It is expected that these large-scale exercises will last until the third week of September, and the reservists will be free to return home in late September. When asked how many warships the King will review in Weymouth, the Prime Minister replied that the ships vary in size, the larger ones being battleships and the smaller ones being corvettes, totaling 150 ships. It is reported that the government's decision to convene 12,000 naval reservists is a natural consequence of the naval authorities' recent decision to bring the annual naval holiday forward by one month. It is said that the warships ordered to participate in the exercises in the Reserve Fleet include one battleship and one aircraft carrier each, four squadrons of cruisers, each with four ships, one mine-laying ship, one destroyer, one supply ship each, four cruiser flagships and submarines each, and several other warships, totaling more than 130 ships.

<h3>British Air Force Prepares to Fly to France Again; More Aircraft; 1,000 People to Participate</h3>
<p>(London) More British bombers than before will fly to France in the middle of next week. The exact number of aircraft has not yet been determined, but according to a Reuters report today quoting an official from the Ministry of Aviation, more people will participate in this flight than in the previous one. It is estimated that about 1,000 aviators will join this exercise, including 300 pilots, who will make non-stop flights, but may not fly beyond the southern border of France. Their non-stop voyage may be longer than the previous 1,200 miles. At the same time, France is also making arrangements to send bombers to London in the near future. The first flight will be during the day. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The British newspapers' claim that British bombers have the ability to fly to Poland has aroused the anger of German newspapers. Most newspapers publish this news with headlines such as "Encirclement from the Sky" and "Threat to the Towns of the Axis Powers," and emphasize that British aircraft cannot fly to Poland without passing through the Nordic countries. If they pass through the Nordic countries, they will violate the neutrality of the Nordic countries. The Evening News claimed that the new British training flights are another proof of Britain's determination to launch a war. It also stated that anyone who flaunts bombers in the skies of European countries must understand the serious entanglements that may be caused. Another newspaper stated that if British aircraft can fly from London to the European continent, then aircraft from other countries can also fly from the European continent to London.

<h3>British Chief of General Staff Flies to Paris to Lead British Guards in National Day Celebration</h3>

<h3>British Response to Pittman's Arms Embargo Against Japan; British and French Parliamentarians Discuss Far East Situation, Advocate Increased Aid to China and Sanctions Against Japan</h3>
<p>(London) Last night, according to a British government spokesman, if the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives pass the Pittman Act on arms embargo against Japan, the British government will implement sanctions because Japan has violated British interests in China. It was also said that the British side is willing to follow the U.S.'s lead in prohibiting the transportation of guns, ammunition, and military raw materials to any country that destroys the Nine-Power Treaty. If this matter is realized in the future, the effect of the Pittman Act will be even more significant. The British government is paying close attention to the actions of the U.S. Congress. It is reported that the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee is scheduled to discuss the bill today in order to send it to the Senate for reconsideration. Yesterday, the British Parliament lounge was mostly filled with discussions on the joint British-U.S. action against Japan. According to various parliamentarians, this move should be a prelude to stopping Japan from infringing on the interests of third countries, and an effective way to strike at the Japanese army. At the same time, anti-Japanese sentiment in official circles here has been rising due to Japan's persecution of British officials and property in China. Lord Cecil made a speech attacking Japan at a reception for French parliamentarians yesterday, and advocated that the British and French governments should immediately recall their ambassadors to Japan. A British Conservative Party parliamentarian then spoke, saying that the British and French authorities should continue to lend large sums of money to China so that the China-Vietnam and China-Burma highways can be completed as soon as possible. At the same time, they should do their best to help General Chiang Kai-shek's army. The reception yesterday was private, and was chaired by Sir Lytton, the former leader of the League of Nations Investigation Commission. Former French Colonial Minister Moud declared on the spot that the time for joint action against Japan has now matured, and in order to achieve the purpose of sanctions, economic action must be taken. Major General Spears, the former head of the British military delegation to France (1917-1920), hosted a banquet for French parliamentarians last night, at which important parliamentarians from Britain and France again advocated sanctions. As for the British-Japanese negotiations, which were originally scheduled to be held in Tokyo starting tomorrow, their future is quite bleak. Anti-British movements in Japan and the Japanese-occupied areas are now accelerating, so officials here believe that the tense situation between Britain and Japan will inevitably worsen as a result. At present, government authorities here believe that Japan's arrest of Lieutenant Colonel Spears is a clear violation of diplomatic precedents among civilized countries, and its ultimate goal seems to be to coerce the British representatives at the Tokyo conference. (Associated Press, 12th)</p>
<p>(London) Representatives of various parties from the British House of Lords and House of Commons met with representatives of the French Parliament in the House of Lords today to discuss the Far East situation for an hour and a half. A statement was issued at the end of the meeting, stating that the British and French parliaments expressed great sympathy for the suffering of the Chinese people, and expressed great admiration for their heroic spirit of resistance. According to unofficial sources, the purpose of this meeting was to discuss ways to solve the existing major problems in the Far East. The most important of the possible remedies proposed in the event of continued Japanese aggression were: (1) Providing more war equipment to China; (2) Implementing economic boycotts against Japan, paying particular attention to Japanese silk. It is heard that some French representatives claimed that if the United Kingdom, France, and the United States all rejected Japanese silk, this economic blow to Japan could make Japan reconsider its position and methods.

<h3>Wireless Radio Transmission and Reception of Images; Germany Plans Mass Production</h3>
<p>(Berlin) German Minister of Posts and Communications Ohnesorge met with a reporter from the "People's Observer" this morning and stated that Germany's wireless radio image transmission and reception machine is currently undergoing large-scale manufacturing, and it is expected to be sold at the lowest price at that time. The receiver will also be displayed at the German wireless radio exhibition at the end of July for people to visit. Technical experts are currently studying which materials to use to manufacture the receiver in order to reduce costs so that ordinary families have the economic power to purchase it.

<h3>U.S. Amendment to Neutrality Act; Roosevelt Will Take Action; Discussed Ways to Facilitate with Hull Yesterday; Will Submit Special Message to Congress</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt is reportedly planning to submit a message to Congress or make a radio address to the nation regarding the Neutrality Act issue. He discussed it with Secretary of State Hull at the White House today, but Secretary of State Hull declined to announce his methods to the outside world. At the same time, newspapers have been criticizing the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's decision to postpone the Neutrality Act until the next session of Congress, with some saying that the Senate is psychologically encouraging the Nazi Party. The Baltimore Sun published a cartoon depicting the Senate waving a flag to encourage Hitler and Mussolini to advance. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Government officials indicated last night that President Roosevelt intends to send a special message to Congress, requesting Congress to amend the Neutrality Act during this session. Although the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted 12 to 11 yesterday to postpone the Neutrality Act until the next session of Congress, the President has decided to resolve the Neutrality Act issue before this session adjourns. Secretary of State Hull met with the President yesterday to discuss the Neutrality Act situation. Hull and the President did not criticize the decisions made during the meeting. The White House claimed that the President has used all possible methods to resubmit the Neutrality Act, but did not indicate whether a definite plan has been drafted. Administrative leaders are attempting to persuade Democratic Senators Gilde and George to withdraw their opposition to the Bloom Act. They are members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and strongly opposed the Bloom Act in the vote on Wednesday. Hull plans to meet with the two in person today. (Associated Press, 13th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Regarding the amendment to the Neutrality Act, the White House is studying various methods with Democratic leaders in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, hoping to resubmit this issue for discussion and allow the government's views to be implemented. It is heard that the following three methods are the most important: (1) Requesting the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to reconsider its resolution (The Foreign Relations Committee resolved yesterday to postpone the amendment to the Neutrality Act until the next session of Congress); (2) Submitting a new bill directly to the Senate to abolish the current Neutrality Act in its entirety; (3) Submitting a bill advocating sanctions against countries that violate the Kellogg-Briand Pact. This level is currently only applicable to Japan, but if a war breaks out in Europe in the future, it will also be a precedent. It has not yet been decided which of the above methods to adopt. According to political figures, the dispute between Congress and the President is a matter of people and has domestic political implications. No matter how the government tries, it will inevitably fail. President Roosevelt once stated that the cooperation between the United Kingdom and France to maintain peace seems to have been effective at this time. If the dictatorial countries misunderstand the attitude of the U.S. Congress, thinking that the majority of U.S. public opinion supports isolationism, then its influence will be enough to increase the risk of war. Therefore, it is necessary to find ways to avoid this. Diplomatic circles also believe that although the European situation has temporarily eased, a crisis will inevitably occur again in the coming months. The outcome of this depends largely on psychological factors. Therefore, the U.S. attitude should not allow the dictatorial countries to have any misunderstanding. The current Neutrality Act contains provisions on arms embargoes, which are not sufficient to protect U.S. commerce and the lives of U.S. citizens in wartime. President Roosevelt does not want Congress to adjourn without completing the amendment, but most people who support the amendment believe that given Congress's attitude, it would be futile to try to resolve the Neutrality Act issue, and it would be better to directly enlighten public opinion. If a European war suddenly breaks out before the Neutrality Act issue is resolved, Congress can still be convened temporarily. In short, public opinion knows that the nature of the Neutrality Act issue is extremely important, but it has been delayed due to differences in domestic political views, and it is already feeling anxious. Editorial comments from various newspapers generally believe that Congress should not adjourn without making any decisions at this critical juncture. (Havas Telegraph, 12th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Aircraft Carrier Suddenly Explodes</h3>
<p>The 20,000-ton U.S. aircraft carrier "Langley" in Norfolk, Virginia, suddenly exploded today, and a fire broke out immediately, causing significant damage to the engine. After three hours of intense rescue, it was extinguished. Several sailors have been injured as a result. The cause of the explosion is currently unknown and is being thoroughly investigated by the authorities. (Havas Telegraph, 13th)</p>
<h3>Italy States its Attitude Towards the Franco-Turkish Agreement; Italian Government Sends Note to France</h3>
<p>(Rome) The Italian government sent a note to the French government on the 10th of this month regarding the cession of Alexandretta and Hatay, expressing Italy's attitude. It is said that the Italian government learned from newspapers about the agreement signed between France and Turkey on June 23, and hereby states Italy's attitude towards the agreement. Italy was not consulted during the discussion of the agreement, nor was Italy's consent sought before the signing. Italy believes that the agreement is contrary to the spirit of the League of Nations' mandate and conflicts with the wishes of the people in the mandated territory. Italy will take a reserved attitude towards the agreement and dare not agree with it. (Haitong News Agency, 13th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Cabinet Approves Policy for Negotiations with Britain; Demands that Britain Abandon Past Policies; Arita to Meet with Craigie Tomorrow</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Cabinet's special meeting today has approved the fundamental policies to be adopted in the British-Japanese conference. Foreign Minister Arita immediately went to Hayama to report the Cabinet's decision to the Emperor. The policies approved by the Cabinet include the following points: (1) Requesting Britain to abandon its pro-Chiang, anti-Japanese policy that caused the Tianjin incident; (2) Requesting Britain to show its sincerity through political and economic cooperation with Japan and maintaining peace in the British concession in Tianjin. Today, various streets in Tokyo are plastered with leaflets encouraging Arita to adopt a proactive attitude, two of which say "Punch Britain in the Nose" and "Overthrow the British Devil Behind Chiang Kai-shek." (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Cabinet held a special meeting here at 9:00 am this morning, and had not yet concluded by 10:30 am. The purpose of this meeting was to allow Cabinet members to exchange views on the government's policies, that is, the plans that must be adopted and the attitudes that should be held in the British-Japanese conference. Cabinet members will make a final decision on these points, and then Foreign Minister Arita will submit this resolution to the Cabinet Advisory Committee and seek consensus. Only then will he go to Hayama to report to the Emperor. It is expected that Arita and British Ambassador Craigie will begin talks on Saturday morning, but the Asahi Shimbun strongly stated that if Arita and Craigie cannot resolve the "fundamental issues," the so-called "meeting on local incidents" will not be held. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<h3>British House of Lords Considers Foreign Trade Issues; Lord Davies Pains Over Consequences of Japanese Dumping; Lord Templemore Defends the Government</h3>
<p>(London) When the House of Lords met today, Liberal Party member Lord Davies proposed a motion advocating that all industries necessary for wartime should be operated domestically as much as possible for application, and to enable people to obtain work. At the same time, Lord Davies also called the government's attention to foreign goods, allowing the import of canned food from Japan, and further discussed the policies implemented by Japan against the commerce of various countries within China, saying, "We must now admit that the entire issue of international trade is closely related to the issue of national defense. If European and American countries allow China's independence to be destroyed, then the trade of these countries with China will inevitably be reduced to zero and be monopolized by Japan. The signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty have guaranteed China's open door. Unfortunately, this door has been tightly closed by Japan. Not many days ago, we heard that we are planning to purchase canned salmon from Japan worth 1.7 million pounds, which is extremely contradictory." Lord Davies then briefly described the quantity and value of Japanese goods purchased by Britain in the past few years, and said, "The Japanese fishing industry is extremely prosperous, has never participated in international fishing conferences, and secretly catches salmon in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of North America. For this reason, Japan is able to dump salmon on the British market and compete with Canadian salmon exporters. In addition, Japanese exporters also print the letters "CAN" on the cans, intending to make people mistakenly believe that they are Canadian products. Please take various steps to prevent this and encourage the import of Canadian salmon." Lord Templemore then responded on behalf of the government, saying that if Britain prohibits the transportation of raw materials for the manufacture of armaments to a certain country, it will at least cause retaliatory measures in the economic field, and the hope for peace will become even more渺茫. If we want to divide the world into two camps, not allowing each other to maintain normal trade relations, then war will inevitably break out. As for the salmon consumed annually in our country, the average is 2,250,000 boxes (48 pounds per box), of which only 1,250,000 boxes come from Canada, so it is impossible to completely replace Japan with Canadian products overnight."

<h3>Restrictions on Jewish Immigration to Palestine</h3>
<p>(London) Regarding the issue of Jewish immigration to Palestine, Colonial Secretary MacDonald declared in the House of Commons that the British government originally planned to allow 75,000 Jews to immigrate to Palestine over the next five years to help solve the problem of resettlement of Central European Jews. However, in recent months, the number of Jews illegally immigrating to Palestine has been increasing, and their intention seems to be to make the proper immigration regulations ineffective. The impact has been sufficient to threaten our predetermined resettlement procedures. For this reason, I have instructed the High Commissioner of Palestine to prohibit Jews from entering Palestine from October 1 of this year to March 31 of next year. After the expiration, we will restore the original method, depending on the situation of illegal Jewish immigration at that time. (Havas Telegraph, 12th)</p>

<p>Before the War of Resistance, the number of students in specialized schools and above generally increased or decreased with the number of schools. In the first year of the Republic of China, there were a total of 115 specialized schools and above nationwide, with a total of 40,144 students. Compared to the 37,566 students in specialized schools and above nationwide in the 19th year of the Republic, this was an increase of 2,578 people. Compared to the 44,167 students in specialized schools and above nationwide in the 20th year of the Republic, the difference was only 4,053 people. Compared to the 41,922 students in the 25th year of the Republic, the difference was only 1,708 people. Starting from the second year of the Republic, universities were gradually established, while specialized schools gradually closed or stopped enrolling students. Therefore, in the second year of the Republic, the number of students in specialized schools and above decreased to 38,373. By the fourth year, it had decreased to 25,242. From the fourth to the fifth year, the number of specialized schools and above decreased from 104 to 86. The number of students also sharply decreased to 17,241 in the fifth year. This was because some specialized schools closed in that year. From the sixth to the fourteenth year, there was no complete survey of the number of students enrolled. However, the number of graduates was 1,155 in the sixth year and 2,272 in the thirteenth year, suggesting an annual increase in the number of students enrolled. The surveys between the fourteenth and seventeenth years were also incomplete. However, the number of schools decreased from 108 to 74, and the number of students decreased from 36,321 to 25,198. This was because some specialized schools were closed again in those years or reorganized into universities. After the establishment of the National Government and the start of political tutelage, university education gradually developed. In the first year of the Republic, there were only four public and private universities. By the seventeenth year, there were 49 public and private universities, an increase of more than twelve times compared to the first year. In the seventeenth year, the number of students was 25,198. By the twentieth year, it had reached 44,167, one of the years with the highest number of students in history. Among these 44,167 students, those in literature, law, education, and commerce accounted for 32,940, while those in science, agriculture, engineering, and medicine accounted for only 11,227. Based on the consistent policy of the central government, the Ministry of Education, in order to cultivate talent for national construction during the constitutional period, emphasized practical sciences. It issued a clear order to promote the teaching of practical subjects such as science, agriculture, engineering, and medicine. It strictly inspected literature and law departments, merging or stopping enrollment, or closing them down in stages. The funds saved from stopping enrollment in literature and law were used to establish or improve science, agriculture, engineering, and medicine departments. Therefore, in the twenty-first year, the number of students decreased to 42,710, a decrease of 1,457 compared to the twentieth year. At that time, the number of students in science, agriculture, engineering, and medicine was 12,007, an increase of 780 compared to the 11,227 in the twentieth year. Among them, the number of engineering students increased the most, with 4,439 in the twenty-first year, an increase of 355 compared to the 4,084 in the twentieth year. The number of students in literature, law, and education was 30,007, a decrease of 2,870 compared to the twentieth year. Among them, the number of law students decreased the most, with 14,523 in the twenty-first year, a decrease of 1,964 compared to the 16,487 in the twentieth year. The number of commerce students still showed an increasing trend, with 2,867 in the twenty-first year, an increase of 711 compared to the 2,156 in the twentieth year. Starting from the twenty-second year, the Ministry of Education issued a clear order to regulate and restrict the enrollment methods of literature and law departments in various universities. Therefore, in the twenty-second year, the number of students in science, agriculture, engineering, and medicine increased to 14,133, while the number of students in literature, law, education, and commerce decreased to 28,787. By the twenty-fifth year, the number of science, agriculture, engineering, and medicine students had increased to 18,457, while the number of literature, law, education, and commerce students had decreased to 23,152. In the twenty-fifth year, the total number of students was 41,922, still 2,245 less than the 44,167 students in the twentieth year. However, the number of students in science, engineering, agriculture, and medicine had increased by 7,232 compared to the twentieth year, while the number of students in literature, law, education, and commerce had decreased by 7,788 compared to the twentieth year. The increase in students in science, agriculture, engineering, and medicine was fastest in engineering. From the twentieth to the twenty-fifth year, the number of students in literature, law, education, and commerce decreased from 16,487 to 8,252, a decrease of 8,235, almost half. However, the number of commerce students still increased from 2,156 to 3,292, an increase of 1,136. This was because schools in the past enrolled the most law students, often exceeding the number stipulated in the regulations. The difference in the number of commerce students was still small. Therefore, after the implementation of the regulations, the number of law students sharply decreased. Another reason was that many specialized schools above law and politics were closed or stopped enrolling students annually. Therefore, since the twentieth year, the number of science, engineering, agriculture, and medicine students has shown a trend of increasing year by year, while the number of literature, law, education, and commerce students has gradually decreased.</p>

<h3>Second Act of the Private Shanghai Cup Basketball Tournament: Blue White and Qianghua Win Big: Pengbi and Tianxing Suffer Miserable Defeats: Liangxi to Play Tiger Team Today</h3>
<p>After the storm, the weather is especially cool. Yesterday was the second act of the Private Shanghai Middle School Cup Basketball League. The morning games were postponed due to site cleanup. The afternoon games were held as usual. In the two Group A games, the strength difference was too great, and both became one-sided. Blue White vs. Pengbi took the lead, with Wang Jien as the referee. Blue White is the incarnation of Guoguang. Although Wang Nanqun and Bao Songyuan have joined other teams, the main players Li Zude, Chen Bangzhen, Zhang Jinxuan, and Chen Hongqi are still strong when they play together. Pengbi's Zhou Junwu, Yu Jinxiang, Li Feiyun, and Dai Changling were absent, and only Wang Shoufang and Zhang Wenyuan supported the remaining team. In the first half, 26 to 13, Pengbi was half behind. As a result, 61 to 23, Blue White won a big victory. Qianghua vs. Tianxing, Tianxing's coordination was loose, and the shooting was inaccurate. Only Qianghua's Xu Wenkui and Zhang Shaoqing kept shooting and scoring, as if they were in an uninhabited area. In the first half, 36 to 17, Qianghua led remotely. After the half, Tianxing tried hard to cheer up, and the battle became slightly tense. Qianghua had victory in hand and did not overdo it. Therefore, in the second half, Qianghua scored 19, and Tianxing scored 16, a difference of only three points. In summary, 55 to 33, Tianxing suffered a miserable defeat. There were also three Group B games, Yun team, Daxia, and Qunfeng successively won.</p>

Since the customs revenue in the occupied areas was seized by the Japanese, the government has transferred the matter to the Central Bank for overdraft payments. By the end of last year, the accumulated overdraft had reached 175 million yuan. On January 15th of this year, the government took appropriate measures and rejected the General Administration of Customs' request for continued overdrafts to repay debts. If the tax revenue is still handed over to the General Administration of Customs in the future, the funds for debt compensation will be allocated as before.</p>
<p>Negotiating with Four Banks for Discount Payment</p>
<p>Regarding the funds for debt repayment, the Ministry of Finance, considering the principal and interest of the unified public bonds due at the end of July, negotiated with the Bank of China, Communications Bank, Agricultural Bank of China, and Farmers Bank for discount payment. The four banks have now agreed to issue "discount vouchers", which will still be handled by the Chongqing Head Office of the Central Bank and its entrusted Bank of China and Communications Bank, paying the full amount in Chongqing based on the "discount vouchers". Shanghai and other ports will be paid in six installments, each installment being one month, which is completely the same as the Chongqing payment method for the sixth installment of the unified public bonds previously decided. However, the "permit for remittance voucher" previously issued by the Ministry of Finance has now been changed to the "discount voucher" issued by the four banks.</p>
<p>Approved for Payment in Chongqing at the End of the Month</p>
<p>The Xinsheng News Agency inquired with the Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank about the payment method for the unified public bonds. Although the deadline was last night, no official order has been received yet. However, it is believed that the discount payment by the Bank of China, Communications Bank, Agricultural Bank of China, and Farmers Bank is a fact. As for the principal and interest due at the end of July, the unified Category A is 7,852,500 yuan, Category B is 5,715,000 yuan, Category C is 11,985,000 yuan, Category D is 20,040,500 yuan, Category E is 9,646,000 yuan, totaling 56,660,350 yuan.</p>
<p>Securities Surge in Black Market</p>
<p>The Shanghai securities black market opened, and the unified bonds of all categories surged sharply. At the close of trading, Category A was 59.10 yuan, up 1.25 yuan; Category B was 49.80 yuan, up 0.90 yuan; Category C was 48.30 yuan, up 1.05 yuan; Category D was 47.60 yuan, up 0.80 yuan; Category E was 47.85 yuan, up 1.10 yuan. At the same time, the market was reassured by the news that the Ministry of Finance had decided on a payment method, and it is expected that there will be continued gains when the market opens today. As for whether Shanghai will pay in six installments in cash or by remittance, it will not be clear until the official order from the Ministry of Finance arrives in Shanghai tomorrow.</p>
<p>Drawing of the Eighth Installment of the Fuxing Public Bond</p>
<p>The seventh installment of principal and interest repayment of the 25th Year of the Republic of China Fuxing Public Bond, in accordance with regulations, is on August 31st, totaling 11,696,000 yuan for principal and interest. The principal repayment lottery was drawn by the National Debt Fund Management Committee on July 10th. As for the method of principal and interest repayment, according to the Xinsheng News Agency reporter's inquiry with the banking community yesterday, although no order from the Ministry of Finance has been received, it is heard that the Ministry of Finance has also decided on a method. Furthermore, the twelfth installment of principal repayment lottery for the 17th Year of the Republic of China Financial Long-Term Public Bond has been scheduled for September 10th, with 22 winning tickets to be drawn, repaying 400,781.25 yuan.</p>
<h3>Customs Floating Docks, Mooring Regulations, Passenger Ship Small Launches Restricted in Mooring Time</h3>
<p>Port Director Tebeck of the Jianghai Customs sent a letter to all shipping companies yesterday, stating that in order to avoid congestion of ships at the customs docks (Bund Floating Docks No. 9, 10, and 11) and to facilitate the public's access to shore, special implementation measures have been established in consultation with the relevant municipal authorities in the South Bund, as follows:</p>
<p>Classification of Various Small Launches for Mooring: 1. Floating Dock No. 9 is exclusively for naval vessels and small launches carrying passengers from incoming mail ships. 2. Floating Docks No. 10 and No. 11 are exclusively for the following vessels and workers: A. Passenger launches carrying departing passengers to various mail ships. B. Various non-commercial ferries traveling between the Bund and various docks, factories, public institutions, etc. C. Workers from various docks, factories, and other industrial institutions boarding and disembarking ships.</p>
<p>Restricted Mooring Time for Chartered Small Launches</p>
<p>Furthermore, ships mooring alongside Floating Docks No. 10 and No. 11 must comply with the following regulations: Except for genuine passenger launches, such as Scott No. 1, Manley Maller, Gezlav Yinping, Da Lai, and other specially chartered launches used to load and unload passengers from various ships, the mooring time for other passenger launches alongside these two floating docks is limited to the necessary time for passengers to board and disembark, and may not be exceeded, nor may they remain alongside the two floating docks waiting for passengers. (Those operating according to a fixed timetable must delay for a certain period between arriving at the floating dock and passengers disembarking, and before loading passengers and leaving the shore. After unloading passengers, they must immediately leave the floating dock and sail to Lujiazui in Pudong to wait. When it is time to load passengers and leave the shore again, they will sail to the floating dock again to load passengers.)</p>
<p>Passenger Launches Must Comply with Regulations: 2. Genuine passenger launches (the launches listed in Article 1) must comply with the following regulations: A. Launches carrying departing passengers to mail ships are only allowed to moor alongside the floating dock for half an hour before the departure time specified in their timetable. B. When mail ships are moored at this port, launches carrying passengers between the Bund and the mail ships are not allowed to moor alongside the floating dock for more than ten minutes. If any ships violate the above regulations, their right to use the dock will be revoked, or they will be fined by the port authorities.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Customs Recognizes Shanghai as an Epidemic Port, Ships to Tianjin Must Stop at Dagu Port and Be Inspected Before Entering</h3>
<p>Tianjin Customs recognizes Shanghai as a port with cholera epidemic. Ships heading to Tianjin must stop outside Dagu Port and be inspected before entering.</p>
<h3>Britain Will Respond Firmly to Japan's Actions in Fujian, Insisting on the Right of Britons to Stay and Enter, Japan Must Be Responsible for the Safety of Life and Property</h3>
<p>The Zi Lin Bao reported that Japanese Vice Admiral Okawa sent a message to the consular corps here yesterday (12th) through Japanese Consul General Miura, stating that Japan will begin military operations in Quanzhou, Tongshan, and Zhaoan in Fujian Province from July 15th, demanding that all ships of third countries, including warships, leave the three ports, because Japan will install obstacles at the entrances, and requesting that expatriates of third countries withdraw from the three places. It is learned that the British authorities will respond, insisting on the right of British people to reside in and enter these places, and will insist that Japan be responsible for any damage to the life, property, and interests of Britons.</p>
<h3>Pudong Puppet Troops Revolt, Guerrillas Take Advantage of the Storm to Advance, Approaching Datuan and Nanhui Within One Kilometer</h3>
<p>The Japanese troops who invaded Datuan and other places in Nanhui had barely caught their breath when the guerrillas, with the assistance of the 45th Brigade of the regular Pudong army and the troops lying in ambush in the suburbs, launched a counterattack at the same time. The three units of Ding Xishan, Yu Taosheng, and Guoshou have joined forces and are said to have won a great victory in Fengxian County. At the same time, the people's militia is resisting the Japanese troops in Nicheng and other places. At the same time, the "Peace Salvation Army" has also revolted, and more than 50 puppet policemen on the Jiangminhang-Hummin Road and the "People's Protection Army" reorganized from the remnants of Guan Gang and Xu Xinzhou also jointly attacked the Japanese military base in Minhang the day before. In addition, in the "North District Self-Defense Force" in Gaoqiao, one squad actually took out the "regiment's" only heavy machine gun, two light machine guns, one submachine gun, one automatic rifle, and more than ten new-style rifles, and announced its independence the night before, passing through Shangchuan Road from Gaoxing to Yangjia Town, and merging with Chen Shaoting's "Self-Defense Corps", its momentum has skyrocketed. All of these are pre-planned actions. The Japanese are suffering from internal troubles and are exhausted. The day before, during the heavy rain, the Japanese army's positions were all facing headwinds and lost their power. Therefore, the so-called "mopping-up troops" have been blocked and unable to advance. Datuan and Nancheng have been occupied by guerrillas, and the distance between the suburbs is less than one kilometer.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Fiercely Attack Datuan, Heavy Fighting</p>
<p>In order to unify the command of the Pudong Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army to become a strong force, He Xingjian was transferred back, and young military officer Xu Zhidao was appointed as a special commissioner, responsible for reorganization and command. Xu arrived in Pudong at the end of last month and began the reorganization. The Japanese believed that Xu's arrival in Pudong was greatly unfavorable, so in order to preemptively strike, taking advantage of the revolt of the puppet police in Nanqiao, they transferred more than a thousand people, carrying light and heavy weapons, and attacked various places in Pudong in the morning of the 4th. Xu also led his troops to defend, thus triggering the great bloody battle. At 4:00 a.m. on the 4th, the Japanese army transferred 600 people, all their forces, from Zhoupu Xinchang, carrying light and heavy machine guns, mountain guns, and small steel guns, two of each, and seven motorboats, and directly attacked Datuan Town. Gu Jimin, the captain of the brigade, led a small part to resist in the Minjia Shop and Liangyuan areas, six miles away from Datuan. For a time, artillery fire roared and the fighting was fierce, until 8:00 a.m.</p>
<p>Bombing of Nancheng and Datuan</p>
<p>The Japanese army suffered about 30 casualties in this battle, while Gu's team suffered one dead and one wounded. At this point, the Japanese army showed signs of collapse and immediately dispatched four bombers to bombard Datuan in turn. The entire town was scorched earth. The National Salvation Army dispersed and stationed in various places. Datuan was occupied by the Japanese army. In the afternoon, four Japanese planes flew to Nanhui City and dropped more than 50 bombs. Many civilian houses in the city were destroyed, and more than 40 people were killed or injured. The loyal and righteous National Salvation Army defending the city resisted in the suburbs. However, due to the fierce bombing by Japanese aircraft, Nancheng also fell.</p>
<p>Datuan Recaptured and Then Relost</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 5th, the loyal and righteous National Salvation Army dispatched powerful troops to counterattack Datuan. Because the Japanese army was surrounded on all sides, the Japanese army completely collapsed in all directions after a short contact with the two sides. Datuan was recaptured by the National Salvation Army. On the morning of the 6th, the Japanese army redeployed 500 reinforcements and launched another fierce attack on Datuan. After several hours of fierce fighting, Datuan was lost again due to the fierce artillery fire of the Japanese army. All day on the 6th, various places in Pudong were shrouded in Japanese reconnaissance and bombing, but the loyal and righteous National Salvation Army continued to take advantage of the opportunity to attack the Japanese army's驻地.</p>
<p>The War Moves South but Has Not Yet Begun</p>
<p>From 1:00 p.m. on the 7th, hundreds of Japanese troops attacked Huangjia Road. Xu Chengde, the captain of the brigade, led his troops to fight back. Xu was from the Northeast and had rich military knowledge and experience. By 7:00 p.m., 24 Japanese soldiers had been killed. In a hurry, the Japanese army did not have time to carry away all the corpses. Xu's team suffered no casualties. In this battle, the Japanese army also abandoned more than ten rifles. At 8:00 a.m., the Japanese side sent three planes to fly to the area to help fight. In order to avoid bombing, Xu retreated to a certain place to wait for an opportunity to attack again. At the same time, another unit of the Righteous National Salvation Army is now active in Fengxian. Therefore, the recent war in Pudong has gradually shifted to that area, but a fierce battle has not yet officially begun.</p>
<h3>Chinese Professional Women's Charity Bazaar, Held at the American Women's Club, Madame Xu Dan Cuts the Ribbon for the Opening</h3>

Madame Xu Dan of France will be invited to cut the ribbon for the opening ceremony tomorrow morning. The dates are the 14th and 15th, and the time is from 9:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. each day.</p>
<h3>Today is French National Day, Russian Arrested Officer Killed by Japanese Sentries Awarded, Parade Held, French Concession Police on Alert as Usual</h3>
<p>Today is the 150th anniversary of the French Democratic Republic Revolution. The French Embassy, French Consulate, French Municipal Council, French Police, and French commercial factories such as the Sino-French Bank will all be closed today for the usual celebrations. In front of the various police stations in the French Concession, such as the Dalz鳴鐘麥蘭 Police Station, the Songshan Road Police Station, and the Lujiawan Police Station, artisans have been instructed to place wooden boards with RF (meaning the French Democratic Republic) on them, with countless tricolored light bulbs installed. The French national flags are crossed at the entrance and decorated with pine and cypress. The French Embassy and Consulate are also decorated in this way. Although the recent typhoon in Shanghai caused some damage, it has been repaired yesterday morning. French commercial trams will also fly flags to celebrate the occasion. Tonight, they will be brightly lit. At 7:30 this morning, French Ambassador Gosseme and French Consul General Baudaize held a flag-raising ceremony in the French Garden and reviewed the French Army, Navy, Volunteers, and French Police. The French police authorities promoted meritorious personnel as usual. French Consul Baudaize will personally award medals to the family of the Russian prisoner of war, Gutuo, who was killed by a Japanese sentry in Xujiahui on the evening of the 27th of last month, in order to encourage others. In the evening, French Ambassador Gosseme hosted a banquet at the French Club on Huanlong Road for guests and naval and military officers in Shanghai. It is reported that the British Ambassador, British and American Consuls, and the captains of foreign ships in the Huangpu River will all go to the French Club to congratulate them. After the banquet, there will be music and dancing to entertain the guests. The Central Police Station in Lujiawan will also host leaders from all walks of life at 7:00 p.m. tonight. The police department has strengthened its vigilance as usual in order to prevent unscrupulous elements from taking the opportunity to cause trouble, in order to ensure safety.

<h3>Typhoon Disappears Near Nanjing, Shipping Announced to Resume, New Cyclone Approaching Taiwan, Whether it Will Hit Shanghai Cannot Be Predicted</h3>
<p>The typhoon that occurred in the Ryukyu Islands in the Pacific Ocean fiercely hit Shanghai the day before yesterday. After landing south of Shanghai that afternoon, according to the 犬文台煎 at 6:00 p.m. the last report on the whereabouts of the typhoon was that it had reached 31 degrees 50 minutes north latitude and 119 degrees east longitude, heading northwest, and the wind force was gradually weakening. According to the Observatory's news this morning, the typhoon is still lingering near Nanjing, not yet out of the Yellow Sea, and is about to disappear. Therefore, the Observatory no longer pays attention to it. It is found that the typhoon has landed in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and because the wind force has been reduced, its impact is not as serious as the damage caused by the typhoon in Shanghai. The Jianghai Customs removed the black ball from the roof of the building yesterday morning, and the import and export building is processing customs clearance as usual, indicating that navigation has officially resumed. Since 9:30 a.m. yesterday, the weather has also turned sunny, with strong winds blowing on the Bund and cool weather. As for the various sailboats in the Huangpu River, they all sailed back to their original locations from the shelter in Lujiazui yesterday morning. At 5:00 p.m. last night, according to the report from the Xujiahui Observatory, a new typhoon broke out near Luzon Island and is now at 23 degrees north latitude and 122 degrees east longitude, approaching Taiwan Island. Because it is in a state of stagnation, its future trend is still unclear. According to the Datong News Agency reporter, the typhoon occurred on the 11th of 木月 and is currently far away from Shanghai.</p>
<p>The English-language Da Mei Evening News reported that after the typhoon passed 40 miles from Shanghai yesterday (the 12th), the city was sunny starting early this morning (the 12th), and the floods have receded. It is reported that there is another typhoon around Taiwan, and shipping experts believe that the typhoon also seems to be heading in this direction and may arrive here at the end of the week. Shipping resumes before the city was hit by the typhoon, and shipping was completely suspended. Although the typhoon warning was lifted yesterday morning and the weather was clear, shipping has resumed, and import and export are as usual. Therefore, the Taikoo Shuntian Wheel. Jardine Eison Wheel. Japanese ship Daikichi Maru. Qingniao Maru (mistakenly Dalian Maru yesterday) have successively imported this morning. The Sino-Japanese Liaison Class Shanghai Maru. Taikoo Chengdu Wheel. Italian mail ship Conteloso sailed as usual yesterday. The sampans that were dragged ashore by the typhoon the day before yesterday were all launched yesterday morning. The Java Shinrin Zhizhalianka is scheduled to export at 4:00 p.m. today. It is reported that after the Italian mail ship Conteloso returns to Venice from Shanghai, it must be repaired in accordance with customs regulations, painted inside, and suspended for one voyage. The company immediately dispatched the mail ship Giulio Cesare from the South African line to replace the voyage on the Eurasia route. The Contelfante, which departs from Venice on August 2nd next month, will be changed to that ship to come to China, arriving in Shanghai on August 28th. As for the Contelfante, it must be postponed by one voyage and changed to anchor from Venice on August 30th.</p>
<h3>British Consulate Warns British Expatriates Not to Go to Qingdao for Summer, Violent Anti-British Riots in the Area, Proving that Japan Cannot Maintain Order</h3>
<p>The Continental News reported that the British Consulate in Shanghai issued a warning yesterday (the 12th), advising British expatriates not to go to Qingdao for summer vacation for the time being, and notified all pod-merchant shipping companies and travel agencies carrying passengers to Qingdao, because the Japanese instigated violent anti-British riots in Qingdao one day last week, and throwing stones and attacking the British consulate made it difficult for the British to stay in Qingdao. This will be blocked. Yesterday, the manager of the passenger department of a major shipping company in the city claimed that hundreds of British and American expatriates had booked tickets to Qingdao and would be leaving in the near future. Qingdao has always been a summer resort for most expatriates in Shanghai. It is generally believed that Japan is attracting trade for Japanese merchants in Qingdao, and maintaining peace during the summer is also a goal. However, it is now proved that Japan cannot maintain order, which makes expatriates in Shanghai suspicious and hesitate.</p>
<h3>Preparing for Inspection and Appointing Committee, Remittance Certificates Decided to be Postponed, Bank Merchants to Collect Remittance Reserve and Implement Inspection, The Amount Collected and Collateral Publicly Announced Separately, Money Houses Participate in Bill Exchange Method</h3>
<p>The Bank and Money Industry Association Remittance Preparation Inspection Committee has been appointed by various groups and the four banks: (1) Xu Jixi, Standing Committee Member of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce; (2) Wu Yunzhai, Acting Chairman of the Banking Association; (3) Qin Runqing, Former Chairman of the Money Industry Association; (4) He Bosigen, Chairman of the Foreign Merchants Banking Association; (5) Hu Meian, Deputy Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, jointly recommended by the Bank of China, Communications Bank, Agricultural Bank of China, and Farmers Bank. The Committee will implement the inspection in accordance with the inspection rules, and will publicly announce the amount collected and the type and amount of collateral separately in order to show great credit.</p>
<p>Remittance Certificates Do Not Need to Be Issued</p>
<p>After the banks and merchants collect the new remittance, it seems that there is no need to issue remittance certificates based on the current situation. Because the general remittance currently used in the market is still the mutual receipt and payment of checks from the bank's branch bank preparation association, and the money industry reserve also participates in the bank's bill exchange by entrusting an agent for exchange. Bill clearing has been concentrated in one place, and there is no need for the issuance of remittance certificates. Therefore, the bank preparation association has decided to postpone the issuance of remittance certificates for the time being. The style of the remittance certificate and the issuance rules have now been formulated by the bank preparation association. If necessary in the future, they will still be issued.</p>
<p>Explanation of the New Remittance System</p>
<p>The Xinsheng News Agency reporter inquired with the banking community yesterday and learned that after the 22 million yuan of remittance funds stored in the preparation association by various banks and merchants have been released in legal tender, the banks and merchants will inevitably apply to the bank preparation association for the remittance amount paid to customers by providing collateral. For example, if Bank A collects 300,000 yuan of remittance bills on the same day, and Bank B pays 700,000 yuan, Bank A will deposit the amount into the bank preparation association as an exchange deposit, while Bank B needs to provide property worth 70% of the assessed value to apply for the remittance amount. This is the so-called new remittance.</p>
<p>Money House Participates in Exchange Method</p>
<p>The money house participates in the bill exchange method by entrusting an agent for exchange: (1) The member money houses' income from the exchange bank of the association and the association's own payment bills shall be deposited into the money house, and deposited into the association by the money house (that is, each house directly uses the association's deposit pair number sheet in the name of the money house to deposit into the association). Except for the association's own payment bills and other payment bills of the trustee bank entrusted by the association for exchange, all shall be submitted by the association for exchange on its behalf. (2) The exchange banks and trustee exchange banks' income from the payment bills of the member money houses shall be submitted by each bank to the association for exchange in the exchange. In the trustee exchange bank, each bank shall deposit the association by using a deposit pair number sheet. The money house's payment bills exchanged back by the association at the exchange, together with the money house's payment bills deposited into the association by the trustee bank, shall be sent to the money house, and forwarded to each money house by the money house. (3) The procedures for the money house to participate in the exchange shall be handled in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing item, and shall be handled in accordance with the association's bill exchange method for agent member banks. (4) Bills between money houses and fellow money houses</p>
<p>Member Dishonored Check Receipt and Payment Method</p>
<p>The method for receiving and paying member dishonored checks is as follows: (1) If a bank rejects a bill submitted by a money house, the bank shall send it to the association with a deposit pair number sheet, and the association shall directly return it to the original submitting money house. (2) If a money house rejects a bill submitted by a bank, the money house shall send it to the association with a deposit pair number sheet of the association in the name of the money house, and the association shall directly return it to the original submitting bank. (3) Other procedures for dishonored checks shall still be handled in accordance with the provisions of the association's letter on bills.</p>
<h3>National Government Efforts: Promoting Health Programs – 25 Highway Health Stations Established; Aim to Establish Over a Thousand in Remote Areas</h3>
<p>A mainland report states that the central government has launched an ambitious health program with remarkably good results, encouraging provincial governments to adopt similar measures to improve the general health of the population. This news comes from American missionary Dr. Blanc, who engaged in medical work in Wuhu in the early stages of the war. He then traveled inland for seven months before returning to Shanghai. Dr. Blanc traversed ten thousand miles in western China, visiting almost all the key cities from Yan'an in the north to Guilin in the south, studying medical institutions for the relief of soldiers and civilians. Dr. Blanc departed from Shanghai in early December last year as a representative of the church's medical department to serve in western China, achieving remarkable results. When he left Chongqing last month, he had already been promoted to oversee the new program for various groups engaged in medical relief work in "Free" China. The central government, under the personal direction of Yan Fuqing, has established highway health stations, deeply benefiting the people of the two therapeutic areas. This program has just passed the experimental stage and is expected to extend to the most remote areas, adding a thousand health stations. Encouraged by the progress of this national program, provincial governments have begun their own public health movements. Sichuan Province was the first to follow, allocating 300,000 yuan in the spring to start the movement. Even in remote Yan'an, the same program has begun. Health stations are currently active in many parts of the province, staffed by competent medical personnel and qualified nurses. Regarding general medical relief in the interior, Dr. Blanc stated that everything is proceeding satisfactorily. Drug supplies are continuously being transported, although there is still a shortage. The strength of medical talent has been enhanced by the arrival of a large number of Chinese and foreign doctors. Dr. Blanc praised the Red Cross under the guidance of Dr. Lin, saying that Dr. Lin and his staff not only perform arduous work but also train personnel to engage in frontline rescue work. Their headquarters were formerly in Changsha, but after the great fire in Changsha last October, they moved to Guiyang, the capital of Guizhou Province. Among those who recently joined the medical service in the interior were twenty-five Jewish refugees from Germany introduced by the Chinese Medical Association. According to Dr. Blanc's information, the work of these immigrants is quite good. Other foreign volunteer medical personnel, about twenty-five men and women, are mostly Americans. A week ago, several European doctors arrived in Hong Kong and went to the interior to participate in the work. A lack of adequate transportation is a major obstacle to the work of medical relief groups. However, despite this obstacle, there is no alarming shortage of medical supplies at the remote health stations. In the past few months, the Red Cross and other groups have experimented with British Collindale gas trucks, which are characterized by their ability to use charcoal or coal to save gasoline consumption. The general health of the population is good, but after Chongqing was repeatedly bombed in May, there were many outbreaks of cholera. The government launched mass vaccinations to prevent the spread of the disease. The largest medical station in China is located in Chengdu, in the buildings of West China University, which houses three major medical schools. Dr. Blanc, the president of the Wuhu Church Hospital, came to Shanghai this time and will go to Wuhu.</p>

<h3>Preparations Committee Discusses Reducing Rickshaw Problem – Number of Vehicles Not Reduced Temporarily, but Soliciting Passengers Must Be Strictly Prohibited</h3>
<p>At a meeting of the Municipal Council Preparations Committee on the 4th of this month, the issue of how to deal with large numbers of empty rickshaws traveling on busy roads and soliciting passengers, thereby obstructing traffic, was raised for discussion. According to the Commissioner of Police and the Director of the Rickshaw Management Office, the need for rickshaws is currently greater than in previous years, so the number of vehicles cannot be reduced temporarily. However, this issue may be considered again in six months. The Police Department has already formulated measures to prohibit empty rickshaws from parking at road intersections and soliciting passengers at bus stops, obstructing traffic. The members of the Preparations Committee all agreed that the Police Department has already implemented these prohibitions and that they should be effective. It was immediately resolved that the number of rickshaws should not be reduced. This motion has been approved by the Municipal Council at its regular meeting on the 12th of this month.</p>
<h3>Dismissed Telegraph Employee Commits Fraud by Using Former Name – Foreigner Discovers and Reports Arrest, Awaiting Investigation and Trial</h3>
<p>After the August 13th Incident of the War of Resistance against Japan, the employees of the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau of the Ministry of Communications organized a relief organization to solicit donations from the outside world for relief purposes, to maintain the livelihoods of the families of deceased telegraph employees. The organization was not dissolved until last winter, but the unused donation books, seals, and other items were not destroyed. As a result, Lu Zhicheng, a Ningbo native, and Lu Qingquan, a local, both dismissed telegraph employees, were able to use them to engage in fraud and deception under the original name, dividing the money they obtained. The afternoon before yesterday, the two Lus again held a donation book signed "Respectfully presented by the colleagues of the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau of the Ministry of Communications" and went to No. 51 Racecourse Road, in the Racecourse Building, to solicit donations from a foreigner named Turner. Turner, a senior official of the Municipal Council currently serving in the Old Zha Police Station, examined the donation notice presented by the two Lus and made some inquiries. He then called the Telegraph Bureau, which confirmed that both Lus had been dismissed long ago, contradicting the two men's claim that they were still working as telegraph employees. Therefore, he reported to the Chengdu Road Police Station, which dispatched detectives to arrest the two Lus. It was later confirmed that the relief organization had indeed been canceled and that the actions of the two Lus were clearly fraudulent. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special District Court, where the police lawyer Qian Xunjiu explained the case. However, the amount of money the two men had defrauded and the number of victims were still under investigation. Therefore, he requested that they be detained. Judge Dai interrogated Lu Zhicheng and Lu Qingquan and ordered them to be detained pending investigation and trial.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province Strengthens Military Service Organization – Party, Government, and Military Discuss Cooperation Methods – Zhejiang Western War Situation Will Unfold Smoothly</h3>
<p>Recently, Zhejiang provincial political and military representatives held an important joint meeting in a certain area of western Zhejiang. The War Zone Party and Government Committee of the Military Commission, the Provincial Party Department, the Provincial Government, and the Commissioners' Offices of various districts all sent representatives to participate. Forty-eight proposals were submitted to the conference and were reviewed in detail. The conference's contents have not yet been officially released. However, it is generally believed that after this meeting, the cooperative relations between the Party, government, and military will become closer, the strength of the war of resistance will become stronger, and the war situation in western Zhejiang will soon unfold smoothly. Furthermore, the Zhejiang provincial county militia standing teams, which were formerly under the jurisdiction of the Social Training Headquarters, could not effectively connect with the military service organizations, resulting in many difficulties in organization and adjustment. With the approval of the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs, the county militia will be uniformly transferred to the military service sections. As for the rumor that the Social Training Headquarters will be abolished, it is not yet true.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Customs Prohibits Import of Goods – Implements Prohibition of Transit – Measures to Prohibit Imports Cannot Be Complied With – Only Prohibition of Transit Can Block Loopholes</h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance issued measures to prohibit the import of goods during extraordinary times, the Inspector General of Customs ordered all customs offices to comply. Yesterday, a reporter from the New Voice Agency inquired with Customs and learned that the Jianghai Customs Office, due to its location having fallen, the interception of tax revenue, and the forced change of staff, had not complied with the previous measures for settling foreign exchange from the export of local goods. Therefore, the prohibition of laundering was not implemented either. However, all customs offices in the Southwest have complied.

<p>Qiu Ru, a Ningbo native residing at No. 7 Datong Road (age 29), between May 3rd and July 4th, falsely used the names of Japanese airline companies and import/export merchants to defraud three banks, Xiangkang on Sichuan Road, Wanfeng on Minhang Road, and Yongtai on Broadway, into exchanging legal tender for Japanese yen. He then transported the money to empty houses at No. 89 Fuzhou Road, No. 75 Xihua Road, and No. 8 Peng Road, where he threatened the bank clerks and apprentices with a pistol, robbing them of 10,540 yuan in legal tender before fleeing. The case was discovered and he was arrested by the Hongkou Police and brought to the First Special Court for trial and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Shan Richeng of the Third Criminal Court conducted a trial. The police lawyer Li Zhishan stated that no other cases had been found during the adjournment and requested that he be severely punished for robbery. Questioned by the judge, the defendant confessed that he was confused at the time and resorted to this desperate measure, and that all the stolen money had been lost in the gambling dens of Rongsheng Company in western Shanghai, begging for leniency. Judge Huang sentenced Qiu Ru to six years in prison as a warning.</p>
<h3>The Case of the "Romantic Swindler" Jiang Jianqiu – Reversal of Closing Arguments and Resumption of Hearing – Crowded Gallery at Yesterday's Renewed Trial – Court Orders Mao Jianqiu and Others to Appear for Confrontation</h3>
<p>As reported by the agency, Jiang Jianqiu, a Jiangxi native and a notorious "romantic swindler" whose case has recently caused a sensation, committed numerous crimes, using fraudulent means to seduce wealthy concubines, actresses, and prostitutes, and stealing their property after luring them to hotel rooms. He was arrested by detectives from the Public Concession Police and brought to the First Special Court for prosecution according to the law. After the trial, Jiang was convicted of both fraud and theft and sentenced to a combined five years in prison. Subsequently, the French Police discovered that Jiang had also committed similar crimes within the concession and sent detectives to re-arrest him and bring him to the Second Special Court for trial. During the court hearing, in addition to confessing to seducing the wealthy concubines Zhou Jinxiang and Li Didi, and female escorts and prostitutes, he also implicated Mao Jianqiu, a pillar of the Gongwutai Kun opera troupe, as well as Yu Guifen, a Kun opera actress formerly of the Tianyunlou at Wing On Company and recently married, and Yao Yuchan (aka Green Peony), an actress formerly performing at the Tianchan Theater, claiming that they had also had romantic relationships with him and that he had given them jewelry and cash. After Judge Qiu concluded the hearing, the date for the verdict was set for yesterday morning. People in Shanghai wanted to see the romantic swindler's demeanor, so the gallery of the Eighth Court was already full before 8:00 AM. After Judge Qiu took the seat in the Eighth Criminal Court, he ordered Jiang to be brought forward and announced that the case still required the summoning of witnesses for confrontation, reversing the closing arguments and resuming the hearing. Jiang Jianqiu continued to confess as before. The court repeatedly questioned him as to whether he was maliciously slandering or unnecessarily damaging the reputations of the actresses Mao Jianqiu, Yu Guifen, and Yao Yuchan. However, Jiang insisted that the facts were true and pointed out that he and Mao had secretly exchanged jewelry at the YMCA in early April, that he had known Yu Guifen in Nanjing in earlier years, and that the jewelry he had given her this time, which he had borrowed from her when he booked a room with her, was also of her own free will. After reviewing the statements, the court ruled that the victims Mao Jianqiu and others must be summoned to court for confrontation. The case was adjourned to the 20th of this month for further hearing, and the defendant was returned to custody.</p>

<p>Zhu Jingci, a Tongzhou native, age 47, who formerly worked at the Dasheng Textile Factory, came to Shanghai as a refugee and rented the fourth floor of No. 5, Lane 198, Rue Luban, for 55 yuan per month, paying two months' rent in advance and moving in on the 14th of last month. However, within a few days, Wu Xiquan (age 30, an Yixing native and lawyer in Shanghai), the second landlord of the premises, forced him to move out, saying he wanted to take it back for his own use. Zhu refused to move because the lease term had not expired, and the two parties repeatedly argued. On the night of the 4th of this month, the two parties fought due to an argument, resulting in Zhu being assaulted. After the incident, the French Concession Police received a report and ordered an investigation. The police concluded that Wu Xiquan had committed an act of bodily harm, so they filed a public prosecution against Wu in the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court according to the law. Judge Qiu Huan-ying had previously conducted a trial, but the court adjourned and scheduled a new hearing because the defendant Wu Xiquan had not appeared. Yesterday, Judge Qiu held another hearing in the Eighth Criminal Court. The defendant Wu Xiquan turned himself in and stated that he had not assaulted the victim. However, the victim Zhu Jingci insisted that the defendant Wu Xiquan had used force. After reviewing the statements, the court ordered a closing argument to be made and announced the end of the hearing, with the verdict set for July 20th.</p>

<h3>Inheritance Dispute Among Poppy Paste Shop Owner’s Adopted Sons Leads to Murder – Three Adopted Sons Arrested – Eldest Adopted Son Allegedly Pushed and Killed Fan Zhenhua – Defendant Denies Pushing, Investigation Ongoing</h3>
<p>The late Fan Jiwu, a Huzhou native who made his fortune selling poppy paste, had three wives and concubines: his first wife, Gao; his second wife, Yao; and his third wife, Shen. He had assets of over 300,000 yuan. Initially, he had no children of his own, so he adopted six sons: Siyu (the eldest), Siyuan, Simao, Sili, Sihong, and Sizhang. Later, Yao gave birth to a son named Sihan (now deceased), and Shen gave birth to a son named Sibin. This large family all lived at No. 23 Yufu Lane, Rue Bel. Recently, the brothers had disagreements over the inheritance, and they often asked their mother to divide the property. However, their mother refused because Jiwu had left a will stating that the brothers could only divide the property twenty years after his death. Although the brothers repeatedly requested their mother, they were unsuccessful. At around 11:00 PM on the 3rd of this month, Sili, Sihong, and Sizhang again requested their mother, but she refused. As a result, Gao suddenly left home the next day and her whereabouts are unknown. Until around 11:00 AM on the 6th, Sili and others discussed with Siyu how to find their mother, claiming that he must know something. However, Siyu replied that he did not know. At 7:30 PM, the three men again demanded their mother from their eldest brother. For some unknown reason, Siyu was shocked and vomited blood. He was sent to Guangci Hospital, but he died. His wife, Guo, reported the matter to the police, who relayed it to the Prosecutor's Office of the Second Special Court to open the coffin for an autopsy. Prosecutor Wang and forensic doctor Jiang opened the coffin at the Fuyuantang and determined that the deceased had died from a shock. The details of the situation have already been reported in this newspaper. Therefore, the police ordered detectives to arrest Sili, Sihong, and Sizhang and investigate. Yesterday, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court for trial by Judge Liao. Police lawyer Yuan Jiahuang stated that the defendants were arrested for manslaughter and that the investigation was not yet complete, requesting an adjournment. According to the defendants, they denied arguing with or pushing their eldest brother, and claimed that the deceased had been suffering from lung disease for ten years and that they had to stand more than ten feet away from him when talking to him because they were afraid of catching his lung disease, so there was no way they could have pushed him. The defendants also hired lawyer Wang Liwu to appear in court and defend them. The court determined that the investigation was not yet complete and adjourned the trial to July 22nd.</p>
<h3>Smuggler Li Yongkuan’s Case Concluded – Sentencing Set for the Morning of the 19th</h3>
<p>Li Yongkuan, Li Jiazhou, and Li Bihua, a family of salt smugglers from Anhui, formed a bandit gang after the National Army withdrew westward in the previous year. Under the false name of a guerrilla team, they set fires, killed, looted, and kidnapped women, in the area of Xihutang Ruanxiang in Songjiang County. They forced them into marriage with Jiazhou and Bihua. Because Lin resisted, Jiazhou shot and killed Lin's mother and buried her body in a pit. They also sold Lin's house to the local tyrant Lu Baoren. In April of this year, after being disarmed by the regular army's 61st Division, the Lis came to Shanghai and hid at No. 11 Zhongxing New Village, Cigu Road, Xujiahui. They confined the two women, Lin and She, preventing them from moving freely. It was not until January 10th of this year that the two women managed to escape and report to the Our Lady's Holy Mother's Hospital. The French police arrested the Li father and sons successively and found items looted from the Lin and She families, such as leather clothing and jewelry. After verifying the facts, they were brought to the Second Special Court and prosecuted for robbery and murder. Because the incident occurred in the interior, a request was submitted to the Supreme Court to designate the Second Special Court to handle the case. Judge Liao repeatedly opened the court for investigation and trial. The three defendants were detained in the prison with shackles. The details of the case have been reported in this newspaper several times. The court opened again at 9:00 AM yesterday. Judge Liao, together with Prosecutor Wang Ren, ordered the three defendants to be brought to court for a brief interrogation. As the facts were clear, they ordered the closing arguments to be made. First, the prosecutor stated his opinion, and then the lawyer of the French Concession authorities made his arguments, stating in substance that the defendants were guilty of robbery and murder, the facts were clear, and that they should be sentenced according to the law. Next, the defendants' defense lawyers, Xuan Zhendong and Lan Xuzhang, made their arguments, which lasted for one hour. The court announced the end of the trial and set the sentencing for the morning of the 19th. The defendants were returned to the prison to await trial.</p>

<h3>The State of Mind Between Couples is Closely Related</h3>
<p>Strictly speaking, a loving couple cannot be considered two people, but rather a single entity, because the psychological and physiological connection between them is so close. In the daily life of a couple, the other's words, actions, habits, and even the feelings and thoughts hidden within their hearts are enough to have a profound impact on the other. Especially in the sexual act, which is the main relationship between husband and wife, because of the exchange of endocrine hormones and the communication of minds, they are even more like a united person, with almost no distinction between you and me. Understanding this, we can believe that teaching a wife in the bedroom is better than the repeated scolding of a daughter by her mother, a word at the bedside can make a prodigal son repent, and the power of love is truly great!</p>
<p>A husband with a virtuous wife will not suffer misfortune, because his heart has been gently and sweetly melted by his loving wife, turning roughness into refinement. Therefore, everything can dispel disasters and bring blessings, and things go smoothly everywhere. However, there are also some unreasonable husbands who often complain that their virtuous wives lack passion, not knowing that they themselves have caused this. A husband with incomplete development or premature ejaculation, even if his desires are as urgent as those of a normal person, or even more easily aroused due to physical deficiency, repeatedly deceives his loving wife in the life of love. After repeated dissatisfaction, the wife's passion gradually cools down. There are also many cases where various pathological conditions occur due to physiological shocks. Therefore, one party being healthy cannot make their lives beneficial, and may even have various drawbacks; both parties must be healthy to be like a fish in water, with indescribable joy and harmony!</p>
<p>A man's body should be healthy and complete, so why does it become diseased? According to medical judgment, this is mostly due to early masturbation, nocturnal emissions, or post-marital debauchery and excessive indulgence, which consumes too much of the reproductive gland fluid. This leads to a decline in metabolism, stunted development, and weakening of the brain, spinal cord, and sexual nerves, resulting in the above-mentioned symptoms. As for the remedy, according to scientific medical instructions and my experience, taking the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Reprogenin" is the most effective treatment. This drug can produce sperm and nourish the kidneys, nourish the nerves, and promote development within one day and night after taking it. The above-mentioned symptoms can be completely cured. However, those with nocturnal emissions must also take "Hemitol Spermatoblock Pills" to stop the leakage, which treats both the symptoms and the root cause, and the effect is even faster! This is a recent case. Wang Yimin from Jiaxing, 35 years old, had masturbation and nocturnal emissions around the age of 20, and married at the age of 25. After marriage, he had premature ejaculation, which weakened the love between husband and wife. Although they had a daughter, she soon died young. Now, not only does he have premature ejaculation, but he also has occasional nocturnal emissions, almost to the point of complete erectile dysfunction. His penis is as small as a snail, and he is also exhausted, often with lower back pain, dizziness, and a bloated brain. He is not yet forty years old, but he is already old and frail. I gave him a large dose of "Reprogenin" and "Hemitol Spermatoblock Pills" to treat him (this good medicine is sold in major Chinese and Western drugstores in the five continents). The nocturnal emissions stopped after a week, and in less than a month, his face was rosy, his energy was abundant, and the love between husband and wife was better than when they were newlyweds!</p>
<h3>Treatment for Nocturnal Emission in the Dog Days of Summer</h3>
<p>— Zhan Nianceng, Specialist in Venereal Diseases</p>
<p>If you don't store essence in summer, you will definitely get sick in autumn!</p>
<p>Everyone knows how terrible autumn plague is. Therefore, summer health care is extremely important. First, you must pay attention to the cleanliness of food, as the saying goes, "Disease enters through the mouth." If you eat something with germs, you will get dysentery, which is very dangerous! Second, you must restrain your desires and take care of yourself. Marital relations should be reduced, and there should be no masturbation or nocturnal emissions. If nocturnal emissions do not stop, too much sperm will be lost, and the body's resistance will weaken. In this summer, not only are you prone to dysentery, but also due to the decline in metabolism, the stagnation of development, and the weakness of the brain, spinal cord, and sexual nerves, symptoms such as dizziness, headache, forgetfulness, insomnia, night sweats, back pain, spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, erectile dysfunction, and incomplete development will follow. This kind of young man is simply dying and barely surviving in this hot summer. Once autumn comes and autumn plague spreads, minor cases will waste time and money, while major cases will often result in death! Therefore, those who suffer from nocturnal emissions must not be ignored in this summer. Finding the most effective treatment is an urgent and imperative task. According to the millions of case studies of world-renowned doctors and my many years of experience, taking "Hemitol Spermatoblock Pills" is indeed the most effective treatment. This drug can strengthen the sperm gate and calm the nerves within one day and night after taking it, allowing you to sleep peacefully at night, reducing dreams and night sweats, and stopping nocturnal emissions that night. If you already have the above-mentioned symptoms, you must also take the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Reprogenin" to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase sperm and blood, and nourish the nerves. Continuous use can definitely cure the above-mentioned symptoms completely in a short period of time, and long-term use can make the body even healthier. If patients come to this clinic for electrotherapy and injections, the effect will be even faster!</p>
<p>Beauty and Health</p>
<h3>Breasts are the Master of Happiness</h3>
<p>— Yao Chongpei, American Doctor of Medicine</p>
<p>Apricot cheeks and peach face in prime,</p>
<p>Full breasts and plump hips, extremely beautiful,</p>
<p>Husband and wife are affectionate, and children are lively,</p>
<p>Happy and carefree like immortals.</p>
<p>The happiest women in the world are naturally the healthy and beautiful women with strong physique, slender figure, high breasts, and plump buttocks. On the one hand, because they are born with beautiful figures, they receive praise and respect from everyone, whether they go to relatives' homes, friends' places, or social occasions, and they get many advantages and pleasures. On the other hand, when they return home, their husbands greet them with smiles and treat them with great affection, and their lively children jump and dance, calling for their mothers to feed them. The family is filled with a harmonious atmosphere of joy, and she is always smiling and happy. Isn't this a living immortal in the world? Not only that, but also because this type of woman has healthy reproductive glands and ovaries, and vigorous metabolism, so even though her age is gradually increasing, her beautiful face and slender figure are still beautiful and moving. What the ancients called "the art of preserving youth" is, in our medical terms, actually the fact that those who have strong reproductive systems, which govern all glands, can naturally not age and stay young forever. The most obvious manifestation of weakened reproductive glands in women is the atrophy of the breasts, the thinness of the buttocks, the dryness of the muscles, and the lack of sexual desire. This type of woman is not only not valued because of the ugliness of her figure, but also easily causes the husband's disgust in the sexual life between husband and wife, and as a result, her fate will be very tragic! To seek remedy, you can only rely on science. According to the clinical experiments of world-renowned gynecologist Kang Delin and French beauty expert Dr. Weiningji, it is generally recognized that taking the ovarian preparation for women, "Reprogenin," is the most effective treatment. This drug is made from the essence of the reproductive glands and ovaries of strong animals, so it can nourish the ovarian function, boost metabolism, regulate menstruation, warm the uterus, and stop leukorrhea within one day and night after taking it. If you continue to take it, it will not only make the atrophied breasts stand tall in a short period of time, but also promote pregnancy function, increase blood count, make the cheeks rosy, and transform ugliness into beauty.</p>

<h3>The New Value of Electrotherapy in Treating Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>In the past decade, there has been indeed rapid progress in the treatment of gonorrhea, and there has been significant progress in physical therapy. Taking electrotherapy in physical therapy as an example, long waves were initially used, and then it was discovered that long-wave electrotherapy could not exert its sterilization characteristics in certain situations. As a result, shorter waves were further researched, improved, and invented. In terms of application and sterilization efficiency, it is truly not as effective as long waves. However, it still has shortcomings in certain situations, while long waves still have advantages. Therefore, long-wave and short-wave electrotherapy complement each other in the treatment of gonorrhea and cannot be abandoned. However, there are many shortcomings of both, which cannot all be listed. Therefore, the electrical equipment itself has been constantly researched and improved by scholars, and more progress has been made. Generally speaking, the electrotherapy used by most physicians today is outdated and cannot meet the ideal sterilization effect. As a result, shallow-minded people generally dismiss it, which is too much. Because the most ideal electrotherapy – filtration and laminar flow electrotherapy – has now been invented.</p>
<p>Filtration and laminar flow electrotherapy is the latest invention in the German electrotherapy industry. Its penetration and sterilization power are just right, without the disadvantages of being excessive or insufficient. It can completely eliminate gonococci in the lymph nodes of acute and chronic gonorrhea. Therefore, major venereal disease hospitals in Europe and the United States all have filtration and laminar flow electrotherapy equipment. Since the invention of filtration and laminar flow electrotherapy, electrotherapy has a new valuation in the treatment of gonorrhea. In my decades of experience, filtration electrotherapy is the best in electrotherapy. If the condition can be examined in detail and supplemented with symptomatic treatment, such as massage for prostatitis and Hiss's serum for arthritis, it can be completely cured within a limited time. Because filtration electrotherapy can sterilize and filter the gonococcal toxin, and serum can eliminate gonococci in the blood.</p>

<h3>Finance: Supply of Foreign Exchange Futures Exceeds Demand; Although Sassoon Concludes, Easing is Seen; Swap Transactions are Quite Large</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market: HSBC's quotes remained unchanged. The spot market for British and American exchange was still stagnant and lifeless. Transactions were very sparse. Paper foreign exchange firms slightly settled accounts. Given the eager supply of foreign exchange firms, the settlement did not change. However, for July futures, although the Western firm Sassoon vigorously bought forward, and the Japanese bank and the Chinese yarn and cloth group successively absorbed US dollars, the foreign exchange firms were also willing to sell, and the inflow of US dollars was even stronger. Furthermore, Chinese banks also came to settle US dollars, so the result showed that the pound was flat and the US dollar was slightly firm. This was due to the rise in British and American exchange rates. For August futures, although Sassoon also frequently absorbed them, and the Chinese yarn and cloth group slightly purchased them, foreign banks sold a lot, and Chinese banks also came to sell, so the result was slightly loose and firm, returning to the original price of the previous day. Furthermore, for July and August swap transactions, a certain bank gave wealthy arbitrageurs US$0.4375, which corresponded to a monthly interest rate (excluding commission) of about 3.5%. However, this was for those with a large position. For a small number of people, they were only willing to give US$0.375. The trading volume of full-date futures was still strong. The buying and selling of Hong Kong dollars were equal, and there was no change in the end.</p>
<p>Most Transactions are Futures</p>
<p>In the early morning, the London telegraphs showed the near-term up by 1.875 and the far-term up by 1.25. The New York silver price did not change. The London gold price also did not rise or fall. The exchange rate of the pound against the US dollar rose by 0.03, against Shanghai rose by 0.125, and against France remained flat. The US dollar rose by 0.0625 against the pound, did not move against Shanghai, and rose by 0.0625 against France. The central government's quotes for various currencies remained the same (applications have been suspended). The bank's opening spot selling prices in the morning were British gold at 6/5.5625 and US dollars at 12.78125 yuan, with no change from the previous close. After opening, foreign exchange firms first came to settle HSBC's spot British gold at 6/5.5625, and then settled the American bank's spot US dollars at 12.78125 yuan. The market situation was extremely calm. When HSBC's quotes were announced, there was no change. The silver balance tax was announced to remain exempt. After that, the foreign bank sector's willingness to sell futures became stronger and stronger, and they competed to sell endlessly. Although Western firms such as Sassoon and the Japanese bank all began to settle, they were unmoved, so the market trend was slightly loose. HSBC sold the Western firm Sassoon British gold for this month at 6/5.46875 and August British gold at 6/5.25. Then, a certain bank also sold Sassoon August US dollars at 12.21875. At that time, Lihe and Holland also successively sold the Japanese bank's main US dollars for this month at 12.625. Near noon, there were large swap transactions. A certain bank sold out this month and bought in August, giving wealthy arbitrageurs US$0.4375, which corresponded to a strong monthly interest rate (excluding commission) of 3.5%. However, for general small arbitrageurs, a certain bank only gave US$0.375, which corresponded to a monthly interest rate (excluding commission) of still about 3%. At that time, the British bank HSBC again sold Sassoon August British gold at 6/5.265625. Later, the American bank Chase sold the foreign exchange firm's spot Hong Kong dollar price still at 44.125 yuan, and the situation was uneventful. Extended to the noon closing, the bank's spot selling prices were the same as the morning opening for both British and American exchange. The selling prices for this month were British gold at 6/5.46875 and US dollars at 12.625, and for August they were British gold at 6/5.25 and US dollars at 12.1875.</p>
<p>The Market was Silent in the Afternoon</p>
<p>The market situation was silent in the afternoon, with little change. Only the Chinese bank came to settle the July and August US dollar futures. It sold the Chinese yarn and cloth group this month's US dollars at 12.625 yuan and August US dollars at 12.1875 yuan. After entering, there was also no news of Hong Kong dollar transactions, but the foreign exchange firm's selling price was still 44.125 yuan. Extended to the evening closing, the bank's spot selling prices were British gold at 6/5.5625 and US dollars at 12.78125. The selling prices for this month were British gold at 6/5.46875 and US dollars at 12.625, and for August they were British gold at 6/5.25 and US dollars at 12.1875. As a result, compared to the previous day, there was no difference in the spot prices of British and American exchange. This month, the British was flat and the American was slightly firm by 0.03125. In August, the British was slightly loose by 0.015625 and the American was slightly cheaper by 0.03125. The Hong Kong dollar was settled at the last price, so there was no rise or fall. The record of the day's transactions is listed below.</p>

<h3>Engulfed by Buying, Gold Price Advances Steadily; Closing Transaction at $2,600 with Only Over 400 Taels Traded</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot "heated red" (烚赤, likely a term for spot gold) market continued its upward trend, closing as high as $2,600. This was due to good demand from Hong Kong buyers, coupled with strong bullish interest from retail investors and close monitoring. Although bullion dealers and securities firms sold off successively, the supply could not meet the demand, resulting in another increase of $8. There were no reversals during the day, and the market appeared straightforward. The total paper gold traded was over 400 taels. Gold ornaments at bullion shops were listed at a premium of one dollar. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained stagnant as before.</p>
<p>Heated Red Further Enters the Dollar Range</p>
<p>From the morning, each bar (ten taels) initially rose due to Hong Kong client commissions to a certain bullion shop to purchase. The market was stable, and the opening price immediately rose by one dollar. A certain bullion shop first bought 50 taels from a money exchange business at a price of $2,593. Subsequently, it bought another 50 taels from a fellow firm at a price of $94. Similarly, a money exchange business also absorbed 50 taels from bullion dealers at the same price. Later, the price was raised by another dollar. A certain gold firm bought 50 taels from a certain bullion shop at a price of $95. After a period of calm, after 11 o'clock, Hong Kong buyers came again to absorb, and a certain money exchange business also had demand. Engulfed in buying, the price soared by $4. A certain gold firm, having profited, sold 50 taels back to a certain bullion shop, and a securities firm sold 50 taels to a certain money exchange business, both at a price of $99. At noon, it rose another dollar. A certain bullion shop then bought 50 taels from a securities firm. $600 was the closing price for the morning session. The market was calm in the afternoon. Although a certain bullion shop rose again to absorb, fellow firms etc. had good supply intentions, resulting in a lack of changes. A certain bullion shop bought 20 taels from a money exchange business and 50 taels from a fellow firm, both at a price of $600. After this, both buyers and sellers were hesitant, and the market was flat. As it did not open until three o'clock, the closing price remained at $2,600. As a result, it rose another $8 compared to the previous day. It has risen for four consecutive days, a total of $23. The daily range was $7. The selling price of the current gold at the cash shop was $2,605, and the buying price was $2,595. The current benchmark gold was listed at $50 lower than the posted gold price. According to inquiries, there were few transactions.</p>
<p>Gold Ornaments Listed at a Premium of One Dollar</p>
<p>The selling price of gold ornaments at bullion shops did not change initially. However, at 10:50, as the "heated red" rose another $8, the price was also listed at a premium of one dollar. Da Tong Hang changed its listing to $263, and Xin Tong Hang to $261, with a buying price of $255.</p>
<p>Pure Gold Remained Stagnant as Before</p>
<p>According to a London dispatch on the 12th, British pure gold remained stagnant at seven pounds, eight shillings, and six pence per ounce. As a result, the market prices of various central banks also remained unchanged. The buying price of Chinese cash gold was $1,212.3, the listed price of Customs gold was $2.396, and the Shanghai standard benchmark gold price was $1,207.6.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Rates Higher Than Drafts</h3>
<p>Yesterday, British pure gold did not move, and British-American exchange rates rose by 125. Foreign exchange in this port was in high demand for settlement by foreign firms. The supply from foreign banks was smooth, and the market price was stable and unchanged. At the opening of "heated red," customer demand was very high, and the market price was $2,593. Subsequently, confidence was strong, and buyers flocked in. The supply from cash shops was not smooth, and the market price rose slowly, with little room for reversal. The noon closing price was $2,600. Trading became sparse in the afternoon, with supply and demand in equilibrium, and the market price was firm and unchanged. As a result, it rose another $8 compared to the previous day. The supply of British and American gold pounds in foreign currency was not smooth, and with "heated red" remaining firm, market prices all trended upwards. The trading of British and American gold notes was quite active. Foreign currency market prices were more expensive than drafts, indicating that the wealthy bought foreign exchange, and the less wealthy bought foreign currency. The supply of foreign currency was ultimately not smooth. British gold notes were flat, and American gold notes rose slightly. Hong Kong notes, French franc notes, and Dutch guilder notes were all in high demand. Although the increases were slight, they were quite firm and strong, and there was little chance of reversal. The supply of Japanese yen notes was smoother, and the market was slightly weaker, with a late-night price of $0.996. Korean notes were in high demand, with a late-night price of $0.885. Trading by the association was not active. Zhenxing sold American gold notes for $300 to Changtai, and also sold American gold notes for $200 to Fuhexiang, and also sold American gold notes for $200 to Yongfeng, and sold American gold notes for $300 to Qintai. Yesterday's market prices: British gold pounds rose by $0.10, American gold pounds rose by $0.15, American gold notes rose by $0.01, Hong Kong notes rose by $0.002, French franc notes rose by $0.005, Singapore notes rose by $0.02, Dutch guilder notes rose by $0.01, Annam notes, Canadian notes, and Philippine notes each rose by $0.02, German gold notes rose by $0.03. Only British gold notes, rupee notes, and Italian lira notes etc. remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Discount Rate Rose Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for drafts and bills of exchange rose slightly. The morning high was $94 per thousand, and in the afternoon, it fell back slightly to $93.5, an increase of $1.5 compared to the previous day. The interest rate for interbank lending by the Money Industry Association remained unchanged, at $0.18 for both morning and afternoon markets.</p>
<h3>Large Silver Bars Continue to Rise; Indian Silver Further Contracts</h3>
<p>According to a London dispatch on the 11th, the silver market continued to be absorbed by India. Speculators entered and exited differently, and the supply was relatively small. The market was stable, and it remained flat after the close. India continued to purchase at the listed price, but most sellers had no intention to supply. The recent price of large silver bars continued to rise by 1875, and the forward price also continued to rise by 125. According to a New York silver dispatch, the American spot price remained unchanged. According to a Mumbai silver dispatch, the market was stable with a hint of fatigue. The spot price fell by three annas, the July price contracted by five annas, and the August price dropped by seven annas. Only one hundred contracts were traded.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Sales of Coarse Yarn Recover; Hong Kong and Yunnan Buyers Purchase Over a Thousand Bales; New Factory Products Remain Unsold</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to rise, with the increase progressing slowly. This was because actual demand had recovered. Coarse yarn from the South China and Yunnan buyers was selling well. Hong Kong buyers purchased 20-count Double Horse, Te Jin Cheng, 12-count, 23-count Golden Chicken, and Da Fa yarns, totaling 765 bales. Together with the Yunnan buyers, a total of 1,120 bales were purchased. With this large volume of spot transactions, confidence was naturally stable, and the market sentiment was bullish. As for the products of newly established yarn factories, buyers lacked demand, and the situation was bleak and dismal, with no one inquiring. The price difference with popular goods remained very large. Just taking the products of Shenxin Nos. 2 and 9 factories, such as "Tian Nu" (天女, Celestial Woman) and "Shuang Ma" (雙馬, Double Horse) as an example, the price difference was now very large. The spot price of 20-count Double Horse was $484, while 20-count Celestial Woman only sold for $470, a difference of $14. Before Shantou was lost, the price of Celestial Woman was $7 or $8 higher, showing that the rise and fall of market prices depends heavily on the volume of consumption.</p>
<p>The yarn situation: At the opening of the morning session, the market was stable, as Guangdong buyers purchased on behalf of Guangxi buyers, and Yunnan buyers also had demand. The market price was stable and fixed, and the opening price was raised by $2. The ex-godown price of 20-count Double Horse was $482, and the warehouse receipt price was $475. There was a little back and forth of 1 or 2 dollars, while everything else was calm. By the close, it had risen another $2. The ex-godown price of 20-count Double Horse was $484, and the warehouse receipt price was $476.5 to $477. According to the half-day transaction statistics, 1,745 bales were traded. The prices of 20-count Double Horse rose by $3.50, Shepherd rose by $3, and 10-count coarse yarn was also firm. The factory, Chongxin Factory, offered 180 bales of 10-count Da Fa at a price of $402, 30 bales of 10-count Te Da Fa at a price of $405, and 75 bales of 23-count Da Fa at a price of $420. 135 pieces of cotton yarn were exported to Yantai today, and 345 pieces were exported to Tianjin. The amount purchased by each group is listed below: Hong Kong 765, Yunnan 355, Mainland 20, Fellow firms 605. Total 1,745.</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market recovered slightly, due to continuous declines in the past few days, and rebounded slightly, but actual demand remained sluggish. The spot price of 20-count Yueqin was around $386.7.</p>
<h3>Nantong New Cotton: Conditions Excellent; Local Transactions Prevented</h3>
<p>New cotton situation: According to a person arriving in Shanghai from Nantong, the conditions of new cotton production there are currently in the stage of sprouting. Observing the production situation, it is not weak, and more prosperous than last year. However, it is still early, and there is little certainty about future climate changes. In the Dongtai area, the cotton seedlings planted in salt reclamation areas are beautiful and reproducing well. If the weather is favorable in the future, with sufficient rainfall, a bumper harvest is expected. The value of old cotton produced locally is also very cheap. The raw material for 20-count or higher fine velvet cotton yarn only sells for $50, and that is in sima catties (司馬秤). However, it is not easy to transport it out, and a certain party prohibits exports, which is even more vigorously enforced. Although inventory at the village level is not exhausted, it is controlled by guerrillas and is not allowed to leave the territory, so it cannot be transported out.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton market price: The New York cotton market was weak again yesterday. At the opening, the price fell 1 to 7 points due to overseas selling and long liquidation. The Ministry of Agriculture is scheduled to meet with major American cotton merchants tomorrow to conduct a detailed and final review of cotton subsidies. As a result, various peers are temporarily taking a wait-and-see attitude towards the cotton market. Yesterday, the forecast for India fell by one rupee, and Egypt fell by more than ten points.</p>
<p>Local cotton transactions are prevented; factory numbers do not transact at all. This is likely due to the financial emergency. As for the source from northern Jiangsu, it is affected by the hurricane, and ships have stopped sailing, so there is still no arrival of goods in Shanghai at the docks.</p>
<p>The possibility of foreign cotton transactions in Shanghai cannot be started for the time being, unless the banks relax and accept collateral so that the finance can be released. As such, even without large amount transactions, there can be some small-volume retail transactions.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Overseas Silk Prices Rise; Shanghai Silk Has No Formal Market</h3>
<p>Overseas silk market: Yesterday, the US and Japan both reported rebounds. The opening spot price in Yokohama was $1,220, up $27, and the forward price was $1,144, up $20. The recent price in New York rose by 3.5 points, and the forward price rose by 2.5 points. Spot Japanese silk rose by 4 points. Shanghai silk was sold from the original plate. The silk market, which had been quiet for a long time, seemed to be turning active again.</p>
<p>Local silk market: Exports had scattered blocks daily, but Shanghai factory silk had hardly any ins and outs for a long time. Currently, most of the transactions were of tin silk. The selling price of silk from Jili six house was $1,200, with no praise or criticism. Recently, there have been no large transactions, because Shanghai silk merchants do not dare to sell forward goods, and cash transactions are tight, so silk transactions cannot be very smooth. The seal factory silk has been very quiet recently, and the price of silk is weak. On the contrary, the price of local native silk is not very cheap, and transportation is difficult, and extortion is huge, and the cost is difficult to reduce. When the export market price is not trending upstream, silk transactions are naturally not started.</p>
<h3>Dried and Preserved Goods: New Daylily Flowers are Sold Upon Arrival</h3>
<p>Several dozen packages of new Xuzhou vegetables continue to arrive, and are still being reported for withdrawal. However, various groups have a demand upon hearing the news, so it has been pre-sold. The market price remains at ten dollars, and the trend is stable. It is expected that it will not be easy to ease unless a large number of arrivals come to the market.</p>

<h3>Piece Goods: Hoarders Try to Sell Off Inventory; Eastern Piece Goods Plunge, Factory Cloth Follows the Fall</h3>
<p>National Cloth</p>
<p>Yesterday, local buyers showed weak demand, and people's hearts were not encouraged. Those holding goods showed anxiety and mostly inclined to sell. Hoarders were at a loss, Eastern piece goods fell sharply first, and the domestic cloth market also gradually increased its decline. The price of white cloth, coarse cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill fell by $0.05 to $0.25 per piece. Although the factory prices of bleached and dyed cloth, thread wool, and serge remained firm, low prices for spot goods emerged one after another. Sales to various routes were small transactions. With the tightening situation in Beihai, southern Cantonese buyers reduced their willingness to purchase sharply. Transactions included over one thousand pieces of colored cloth and colored twill. The Yunnan route was safe, and the transaction were more active. Moreover, postal packages will also be restored, so the pre-ordered goods are gradually being dredged, and additions are few. Transactions included over one hundred scattered pieces of fine cloth, fine twill, colored cloth, colored twill, and printed cloth. Shops and wholesale shops on this street have sufficient inventory, and are also trying to sell off inventory. Various popular and short-supply goods are still being added to the market for sale. Transactions included 40-50 pieces of white cloth, coarse cloth, and coarse twill. There were over one thousand pieces of foreign yarn, linen yarn, and poplin. They are watching the autumn and winter goods with intent. The Yantai buyers of the northern route purchased 20 to 30 bales of Dasheng and Jardine Matheson 16-pound coarse cloth. Tianjin buyers are still only managing fixed amounts.</p>
<p>Eastern Piece Goods</p>
<p>Yesterday, the decline of white goods resumed. Due to the quiet sales in the market, fellow dealers were willing to sell loosely, and the market gradually felt unsupported. The price of fine cloth and fine twill gradually trended downward, continuing to fall by $0.10 to $0.25 per piece. The calling price for 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was $13.35, and baby fine twill was willing to be soft, only selling for $12.55.</p>
<p>On the 14th, 215 pieces of piece goods and 10 pieces of wool were shipped to Yantai.</p>
<h3>Securities: Public Accumulation Suddenly Excited Due to Kong's Speech</h3>
<p>The securities grey market reversed sharply yesterday, and the market sentiment and people's hearts showed a turnaround trend. Due to three consecutive days of decline, it triggered short covering and temporary buying. Minister Kong's speech, although still the familiar air of peace, was like a ray of dawn in the dark valley, and there was a reason for the sudden turn in market prices. In general, people subtly speculate that the British-Japanese negotiations in Japan will touch on the Sino-Japanese issue. This is a matter of opinion, and everyone has their own views. Market prices are dominated by this psychological aspect, and seem to have temporarily put aside the issue of principal and interest. The market situation may gradually trend upwards. Due to the strengthening of the off-market the day before, the opening price was up several corners. Category C opened at $8, and the market sentiment suddenly strengthened. Xieda and No. 35 both turned to buy, and Tongkang, Dingkang, Hengfu, and Maoxin were also absorbed. The market situation gradually trended higher. The seller No. 20 sold Category B, and Renchang sold Category E. Lianyuan, Lianhe, and Xingyuan all sold Category C. The rest were scattered transactions. As a result, market prices unanimously rebounded by $0.80-0.90 to $1.25. The total transaction volume was approximately $600,000. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category | Highest | Lowest | Closing | Compared to the previous day</p>
<p>---|---|---|---|---</p>
<p>Unified A | 59.10 | 58.90 | 59.10 | Up 1.25</p>
<p>Unified B | 50.00 | 49.70 | 49.80 | Up 0.90</p>
<p>Unified C | 48.26 | 47.95 | 48.30 | Up 1.05</p>
<p>Unified D | 47.60 | 47.30 | 47.60 | Up 0.80</p>
<p>Unified E | 47.90 | 47.70 | 47.85 | Up 1.10</p>
<p>In stock trading, 50 shares of the Yarn and Cloth Exchange were traded at a price of $37.</p>

<p>Rice: The sales market is still stagnant, but there is not much spot goods on the market, so the market is flat and tired.</p>
<p>Ke Xian: The source has continued. More than 2,000 packages arrived yesterday. After the Hangzhou gang and others were active the day before, yesterday they were loading and storing the answer, so trading was stagnant again. However, various households in Muji Street were obstructed by wind and rain on the frying day, so they added to the market yesterday. Therefore, there were still about 2,000 packages of transactions, but due to sufficient warehouse storage, line hoarders were planning to sell the goods in time. High-end prices were pressed down by 2 cents, and the mid-range goods were discounted by 2 or 3 cents. There was a break-in price of 15 yuan, and the high goods only opened at 10 yuan.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Soybean Cake Hoarded Goods Enter the Market; Oil Market Is Quite Mediocre</h3>
<p>Oil market: On the previous day (12th), due to a hurricane hitting Shanghai, the market for miscellaneous grain oil cakes was located on the Pujiang bank. The storm on the Edward Road section was even more fierce, so that only 20 or 30 people operated in the area. As a result, the formal market was virtually suspended. In the morning, three batches of soybean oil were opened, namely Jiaozhou oil at $33.90, Qingjie oil at $34.30, and Yinqi oil at $30.80. Although the rain stopped and the wind subsided in yesterday's market, there was no interest in trading in the market. The overall trend of peanut oil was mediocre. The opening price for Jiaozhou oil was $34.45, and the transaction was not interesting. The price of peanut oil was in line. 30 barrels of oil that arrived from Kobe yesterday were priced at $47.80, a slight increase of $0.30 from the 11th market.</p>
<p>Soybean cake: Sources continued, and sales were slow. However, the selling was excessive, causing the market to turn down by 6 points under the hoarders' urgent disposal. It is estimated that 2,000 pieces of Dalian Yuanji cake were opened at a price of $3.15 to $3.13, and 3,000 pieces of miscellaneous brand cakes were priced at $3.13 to $3.11.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: White and Red Sugar Market Trend Loose; Full Upper Ice Opening Price Is Higher</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market, according to London News, recent coarse white fell more, 8-month fell $0.03, to $7.06, 12-month fell $0.75, to $6.0225, March of next year fell $0.01, to $6.0275, Dutch News, 8 months fell $8.06, September October fell $8.03, Hong Kong electricity to Shen bao fare was HKD10.40, the municipal association drew the disk, spot 24 Coarse White was stable, the local dock was $29.08, the foreign dock was $0.06, transit cargo was slightly reduced $0.01 to $21.04, Taikoo Car White was slightly up and down, West Dock B mark was $31.03, CW Mark was $31, CX Mark was $30.08, DY Mark was $30.03, HX Mark was $30, H Mark car red was still $20.02 in cash, Dutch red fell $0.05 or $0.06, the current price was $22.04, the transit price was $16.50, the original Mian white and No. 1 ice were both at the original price. Only 60 packages of Guotang's Zu Shang ice were priced at $30.075.</p>
<h3>Grains: Reduced Production; Flour Factory Prices Are Difficult to Relax; New Wheat Arrives on the Market, Prices Fall, and Grain Merchants Also Order a Ship of Foreign Wheat</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday's spot flour trading was slightly active compared to the previous period. Retail sales on this street showed greed, and mainland buyers also inquired slightly. This was because the wind and rain of the previous day caused the demand to turn strong. The transaction was approximately 10,000 bags. Sales to customers were as flat as usual. Although there were scattered decorations in Qingdao, Weihaiwei, and other places in Beiyang, the amount was only 1,000-2,000 bags and 2,000-3,000 bags of transactions. South sales were even more deserted due to the situation. However, the factory's attitude was that production has gradually decreased, and the selling price was not too accommodating. Therefore, No. 2 flour still required $4.65 in cash, and insisted on not relaxing. The supply of back-loaded goods in the market was also low, and the situation was slightly tighter than before. However, it is still difficult to develop the market prospects for the time being.</p>
<p>Wheat: The source of new wheat has gradually surged. In addition to the continuous transport on the Shanghai-Ningbo Road, Hankou wheat has also arrived in Shanghai, amounting to about 3,000 bags. Just when the market was falling, it temporarily did not show samples for sale. It is heard that the current production prices have become relaxed. On the Hua factory's side, it also paid attention to purchasing foreign wheat. New arrivals and inventories were both sufficient. It is heard that grain merchants have also newly ordered a ship of Australian wheat, estimated at 9,000 tons, at a price of $8.30, equivalent to only $6.67 per 100 catties in the market scale. Therefore, the impact on the future of local wheat is huge. The market yesterday still lacked giao. Japanese plants also handled the purchase of 500 bundles of Nanjing wheat at a price of only $6.05, at the previous disk fork secret Xiaochiba.</p>
<h3>Japonica Rice Is Still Weak; Ke Xian Transactions Are Still Strong</h3>

<h3>Thirty-Fifth Anniversary of Chekhov's Death</h3>
<p>— Translated by Ou Zhi</p>
<p>Anton Pavlovich Chekhov was born in Taganrog on January 29, 1860. He began his literary career in 1880, while also working in local medicine and public schools. Chekhov's literary skills continuously improved, and his reputation spread rapidly. By the 1890s, he was a well-known novelist in Europe. In 1900, he was elected as an honorary academician, alongside Tolstoy and Korolenko. In 1902, he protested Tsar's refusal to approve Gorky's election by demonstratively rejecting this title. On July 15, 1904, after a severe and prolonged illness, this great artist sadly passed away.</p>
<p>In his early humorous novels, Chekhov already appeared as an exposer of vulgar enthusiasm. Gorky said, "Before him, no one could describe the dull daily life of the petty bourgeoisie so ruthlessly and faithfully." As time passed and his writing developed, Chekhov increasingly exposed the bleak aspects of Russian life in the 1880s and 1890s.</p>
<p>The intellectual emptiness and unfounded ideas of intellectuals, the bankruptcy of Populist worldview, the swaggering of the petty bourgeoisie, the decline of the aristocracy and the rise of the bourgeoisie, the contradictions of reforming rural society, the incompetence of officials and the tyrannical oppression! These were Chekhov's themes.</p>
<p>Autocracy drove Russia into a dead end. Initially, Chekhov did not see a way out of this predicament. However, gradually, his belief in the possibility of transforming life strengthened. He said, "If everyone does what they can on their own piece of land, how beautiful our earth would be."</p>
<p>In his later years, he understood more clearly that only a courageous struggle against social evils could change life.</p>
<p>Chekhov's favorite literary form was the short story. At the same time, he also created many extraordinary plays ("The Seagull," "Uncle Vanya," "Three Sisters," "The Cherry Orchard," etc.), which he called "lyrical comedies."</p>
<p>Chekhov's work opened a new chapter in the development of Russian and world literature. Tolstoy said that Chekhov was an artist who could not be compared to previous Russian writers: "Chekhov has his own Impressionist style. It seems that this person is applying colors randomly... Step away and take a look, and you get a strange impression overall. It turns out that you have a clear and undeniable picture in front of you."</p>
<p>Chekhov's writing style had a great influence on writers in Russia, Europe, and America. Chekhov was a writer of aesthetic beauty. According to Gorky, he was difficult to imitate: "Future historians of literature, when discussing the development of the Russian language, will certainly say that this language was created by Pushkin, Turgenev, and Chekhov." (Translated from Soviet Literary History)</p>
<h3>Flower Shop and Letter</h3>
<p>— Liu Lan</p>
<p>One afternoon, I walked into a flower shop with a friend. I felt lost, as if I had wandered into an unfamiliar street. What kind of flower is jasmine? Is it lilac? Purple? White? Forget-me-not, what a pleasant name, which one is it? My friend chose a basket of red roses on her own, saying she was going to give it to a friend who was getting married.</p>
<p>Poets like to use roses to symbolize love, but for thoughtful people, this saying is an ominous prediction. Aren't beautiful flowers the easiest to wither? From the fallen petals, we can taste the sorrow of encounters. Why cast a shadow on a youthful heart?</p>
<p>Coming out, I said, "These flowers are quite pleasing." My friend said, "Very lovely." A withered, skeletal hand stretched out in front of us, a pale face murmuring, asking for enough money to buy a pancake. What cruel irony! "Living in this city, one day, people will go crazy," I said. "We should have the courage to face the dark side of life, and behind indignation, we need struggle to support it. Otherwise, even the most beautiful passionate words are empty." My friend explained to me.</p>
<p>The next day, a letter arrived:</p>
<p>"The bright color of the red roses aroused my sympathy for them. However, when I remember that they are just cut flowers that have already lost their life and freedom, I begin to hate them. I dream of flowers growing in the wild, they are happy, not confined in greenhouses, decorating winter as spring; but gently painting a trace of hope and warmth on the heart of a wanderer." These words are very touching.</p>
<p>Who wants to be a flower in a greenhouse? The storm is tightening, and only the fittest can survive. There should be a choice between enjoyment and freedom. But, we must first see the distance! Poor myopic patients! No, I want to say they deserve it.</p>

<h3>Talking About the Past (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Ke Shan</p>
<p>The Unofficial History says: "...The recommendation form had already been written, but the name was left blank. Everyone discussed and dared not issue it. Song Qiyu, the Assistant Secretary of the Left, arrived from outside and asked who Shi Yong was recommending. Shi Yong said, "The Jin people ordered Wu Kai to secretly instruct us to recommend Zhang Bangchang." The text has already been written, but the name has not been filled in. Qiyu then recalled that the Jin people had previously written a text saying: 'Please recommend the Southern Official at the front line.' He believed it was undoubtedly Zhang Bangchang, so he took a pen and wrote the three characters Zhang Bangchang and showed them. Shi Yong said, "Yes." He also showed them to the officials who were deliberating, but none of them spoke. Then he filled in Zhang Bangchang's name on the written text and wrote a separate petition, giving it to Wu Kai and Mo Chou, and Qi's text left the city."</p>
<p>These paragraphs vividly describe the situation of the election at that time, reminding us of the situation when Lu Jianzhang, the General of Mighty Army, surrounded the Congress in the early years of the Republic and forced the election of Yuan Shikai as President. Thus, Grand Chancellor Zhang Bangchang was to become Emperor.</p>
<p>Unofficial History: "That day early, civil and military officials, monks, Taoists, soldiers and civilians gathered at the Hall of Shangbi to prepare for the ceremony. At that time, it was reported to the front line that the person carrying the imperial decree and seal had entered the city. The Jin people sent more than fifty people with several hundred plain-clothed horsemen to follow. Bangchang wailed loudly from the Ministry of Ceremonies as he got on his horse, pretending to be dazed and about to fall from the West Gate. He stood on the horse for a short while, regaining consciousness, and wept again. The Jin people's Grand Tutor Zeng led more than fifty people, carrying imperial robes and a red umbrella, to set up in the tent. Bangchang changed into imperial clothing and shortly thereafter stepped out and walked to the mat outside Yide Gate, kneeling and bowing toward the Jin state to receive the decree and seal. The decree read: "Without virtue, I become king, so Heaven's mandate is entrusted to my hand. I shall not yield to benevolence, knowing that the succession lies in your person." Therefore, Zhang Bangchang is enthroned as Emperor, the nation is called 'Great Chu,' and the capital is Jinling. Bangchang wore red brocade, returned to his seat, and the Jin people bowed to Bangchang, who mounted his horse and left the gate, with the officials guiding him as before... A separate chair was placed on the west side of the imperial bed, and he sat to receive congratulations from officials, etc. When the civil and military officials were all in line, Zhang then stood up and conveyed the decree through the gate, saying: "Wood is a living thing, I dare not steal the throne. If you do not obey, then I should withdraw." Shi Yong led the officials to bow hurriedly, and Zhang quickly turned around, facing east and standing with his hands clasped."</p>
<p>Zhang Bangchang's wailing, dizziness, attempts to fall, and weeping were all expected acts, but he seemed very calm when he knelt to receive the decree and seal. Another record cited by the Compilation says:</p>
<p>"Bangchang stood, calling for bows and guides, all done by the Jin people. The first time he bowed, a Jin person grabbed his collar and said to the people of the capital, 'Look at this official, he looks just like the one who came before.'" Bangchang entered the palace, and the Jin people all excused themselves. A guard said, "In the past, we saw actors perform in variety shows, always pretending to be officials; today, Grand Chancellor Zhang is pretending to be a real official."</p>
<p>Also, when the officials supported Zhang Bangchang to become emperor, there must be a petition of urging him to proceed as usual, the draft of which was written by Wang Shao, the Junior Supervisor of Military Equipment. The Compilation says:</p>
<p>"Wang Shao's petition first described the Emperor of Great Jin, saying, 'His principles align with the three luminaries, his merits tower over the nine realms, his virtue is pure and abundant, his wisdom is close to the Dao of the Emperor, he punishes crimes for the people, and his righteousness surpasses King Zhou.'" Then it described Bangchang, saying, "Only the great Chancellor, deeply understands the ways of Heaven and man, his learning penetrates ancient and modern times, his reputation is long-standing both inside and outside, the will of Heaven and man is in harmony, worthy of the respect and praise of great nations, hoping for the most magnificent achievements of previous kings, he can govern the country and rule the people."</p>
<p>Such an article is also wonderful, showing that those articles of Qin Meixin, Wei's abdication, and other articles can no longer claim to be unique, but I don't know if there will be even better articles in the future?</p>

<h3>Red Devil Vasika</h3>
<p>— By Gorky, translated by Di Zhou</p>
<p>"Crying won't do any good!..." Lida answered with a laugh.</p>
<p>"Madam, get those nasty goods out of here... What are they doing here!?"</p>
<p>"Are you scared?" Lida leaned down and asked him.</p>
<p>"Get out, everyone get downstairs!..." the madam ordered.</p>
<p>They ran downstairs; but as they went, they each turned back to look at his face with an ominous gaze. But Lida said quietly:</p>
<p>"Go!"</p>
<p>Ajiusniya even raised her fist to threaten him, saying:</p>
<p>"Ah! Devil! What now—not so sharp now, are you?... Serves you right, serves you right!..."</p>
<p>Her boldness surprised everyone.</p>
<p>Downstairs, they were all immersed in a vortex of dissolute joy, vengeful happiness, and intense pleasure they had never experienced before. Amidst their jubilations, they loudly cursed Vasika, and even the madam was startled by their frantic atmosphere and infected by them.</p>
<p>The madam was also pleased to see Vasika in such a predicament. She also disliked him, because he didn't treat her like an employee in front of her (he treated her almost like an officer to a subordinate, like a master to an assistant). But she knew that without him, she couldn't control the prostitutes. She vaguely explained her feelings to Vasika.</p>
<p>The doctor came, applied gauze, wrote a prescription, and left, adding that it would be best to let Vasika go to the hospital.</p>
<p>"Hey, how is everyone? Aren't you going to visit our precious patient?" Lida bravely called out.</p>
<p>So they laughed and shouted as they went upstairs together. Vasika was lying with his eyes closed. Hearing the sound, he didn't even open them as he said:</p>
<p>"You're here again?... "</p>
<p>"Now we're here to comfort you, Vasika Minonezh..."</p>
<p>"Who wants your comfort?"</p>
<p>"Remember how you used to treat us!..." (Eight)</p>

<p>Shanghai Chinese Professional Women's Club Fundraising for Summer Relief of Refugees through Charity Sale of Goods Special Issue</p>
<p>— Inscribed by Xu Jiqing</p>
<h3>Inaugural Message</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, under the slogan of "those with money give money, those with strength give strength," the national masses have offered their wealth and strength with great enthusiasm, fulfilling their national duties. However, "in recent years, compatriots in various regions have suffered from the destruction and impact of the war, resulting in countless casualties, disabilities, displacement, hunger, and cold, and the loss of parents." And "this cruel catastrophe has long aroused the sympathy of international friends, who have continuously provided valuable assistance. Therefore, we, as compatriots, should provide further assistance."</p>
<p>However, because "in the past, people in Shanghai were concerned about the suffering compatriots across the country and generously donated money and saved funds, but because we are in an isolated island, our income is limited, and long-term cash donations are always somewhat difficult. At the same time, due to the difficulty of the collection procedures, it could not be popularized among the public. In order to allow every righteous and benevolent person who is happy to donate to do their best, and to complete the good deed of helping the refugees through the donation or purchase of goods." Therefore, at the end of May, we decided to hold a charity sale of goods, preparing to combine the three slogans of "those with money give money, those with goods give goods, those with strength give strength" in the "charity sale."</p>
<p>"Charity sale" is still a pioneering effort in Shanghai, and all members of our club are weak and incompetent, so it took several months to prepare, which is due to the constant encouragement from the club's sponsors and the enthusiastic donations from various companies and merchants. The proceeds from the club's charity sale were originally intended to be donated for general refugee use. In the latter half of last month, the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association asked various social organizations to form a fundraising committee for summer health expenses for refugees. Because we believe that the number of refugees in Shanghai has not decreased, and living together in the summer is most likely to cause epidemics, which has a great impact on society, we decided to donate all the proceeds from this charity sale to the summer health expenses for refugees. This should be mentioned in passing.</p>
<p>In the days before the "charity sale" was about to begin, we received words from the club's sponsors and writings from leading women, which added a lot of vitality to this publication. This should be specially thanked.</p>
<h3>Thoughts on the Charity Sale of Goods by Professional Women</h3>
<p>— Huang Dinghui</p>
<p>The Professional Women's Club is a well-known women's organization in Shanghai, bringing together sisters from various professions who have received advanced education and serve the community. They connect emotionally, promote mutual assistance, and strive for further education, similar in nature to the Silver Money Industry Association and the China United Entertainment Association, all demonstrating the spirit of national unity and progress. Their work achievements and the growing success of their activities over the past year are admirable.</p>
<p>In this hot summer, concerned about the refugees who are displaced, fleeing from danger, and barely surviving in the shelters, in addition to sadness and anger, their physical resistance is naturally reduced due to insufficient nutrition, and epidemics and various diseases are easily transmitted and spread. The sisters of the Professional Women's Club want to fulfill their responsibility of mutual assistance in times of crisis, so they launched a charity sale of goods. They solicited donations of goods from benevolent people, major companies, and manufacturers. The proceeds from the sale, after deducting expenses and a small portion of the costs withdrawn by donors, are entirely donated to the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, designated for summer health expenses for refugees. The sisters of the Professional Women's Club have acted bravely and won strong support from all sides. After months of preparation, they have overcome various difficulties and obstacles. The charity sale of goods is a righteous and good deed, and it has been successful. However, the enthusiasm, perseverance, and selfless dedication of the sisters of the Professional Women's Club are particularly commendable.</p>
<p>As the sage said: "The heart of compassion, everyone has it." And also said: "Who is not as good as me in loving goodness." On behalf of the disaster victims, I urge social leaders and prominent women to come together, participate in this good deed, donate generously, purchase enthusiastically, and benefit without spending much. Save our summer entertainment and cold drink expenses, buy all our summer necessities, and not only will money not be wasted, but we will also gain the merit of helping ourselves and others. Why not do it? It is most joyful to do good. I hope the sisters in Shanghai will remember the efforts of the sisters of the Professional Women's Club, rise up and move forward, and fulfill our shared responsibility as compatriots.</p>
<p>Recently, I have sometimes heard strange arguments against rescuing refugees. Their reasons are: Two years of relief work have increased the refugees' dependence and lazy behavior of living in temporary peace. It is true that refugees are not all good, but the vast majority are kind, and can endure all kinds of suffering, and are unwilling to sell their souls to be slaves of a conquered nation, and are compatriots with noble integrity. Many of them are working hard to learn a skill, and many children are receiving education in the midst of national crisis. I think anyone with passion would not bear to stand idly by. Moreover, many hands make light work. Looking at Shanghai's current abnormal prosperity and unrestrained waste, with just a little effort, the refugees will benefit immensely. Furthermore, as the situation is not yet clear, we should not fail to carry out our efforts to the end and cause them to be displaced again. We can only strive to improve the relief work, so that the refugees living in various shelters can learn various skills and contribute their labor in the future to participate in the reconstruction of the Republic of China. There is only active improvement, and no passive cancellation. I ask social leaders what they think?</p>
<h3>The Process of Preparing for the Charity Sale of Goods</h3>
<p>The charity sales and disaster relief movements of peddlers in Hong Kong and Guangzhou, and the plight of more than 80,000 refugees in Shanghai, have successively stirred the hearts of each of us. We feel that disaster relief should be the minimum responsibility of Shanghai residents. Judging from the current situation, relying solely on "saving and disaster relief" to rescue Shanghai is not enough. It is necessary to more extensively mobilize the manpower, resources, and financial resources of all sectors of society to solve this problem. Therefore, at the end of May, the association, based on the enthusiasm for disaster relief, launched this charity sale of goods, hoping to rely on the strength of many members to extensively promote the industrial, commercial, and factory numbers and enthusiastic people in Shanghai to complete a large-scale charity sale of goods and charity purchase.</p>
<p>Thus, we established a preparatory committee, which decided on the method of the charity sale of goods: standing on the position of "those with goods contribute goods, those with strength contribute strength, those with money contribute money," collect goods from various industrial, commercial, and factory numbers or individuals, and hold public sales on the specified dates and locations. In order to ensure that all goods are sold, we issued prepaid vouchers before the public sale (vouchers are divided into six types: five cents, one yuan, five yuan, ten yuan, fifty yuan, and one hundred yuan). At the time of the public sale, buyers can exchange vouchers for goods at face value. Of course, cash purchases are even more welcome. All income and expenses of the charity sale will be reviewed by the financial committee members Li Wenjie, Li Hongshou, and others, and then used to help the refugees.</p>
<p>What excited us first was that as soon as we prepared the origin and outline of the charity sale, we received sponsorship from fifteen gentlemen including Yu Qiaqing, Lin Kanghou, and Xu Jixiao, which made our work smoother.</p>
<p>The sooner the better. Following the beginning of June, each member, under the slogan of "sacrificing everything for the charity sale," accelerated their activities. The recruiters went to various factories, merchants, and relatives and friends with smiling faces every day to appeal for the refugees; those who produced items weaved their sweat and enthusiasm into the products stitch by stitch non-stop; and those in charge of storage and publicity also worked hard. A charity sale that was planned to be held in early July had been almost prepared by the end of June.</p>
<p>But why did the news of the postponement of the charity sale suddenly appear in the Shen Bao at the end of June? The matter is like this: At a Ping opera broadcast for charity sale publicity at the end of June, we were honored to have two sponsors of our association, Mr. Lin Kanghou and Mr. Yuan Ludeng. After they also participated in broadcasting several Ping opera songs, they also reported some words about raising summer health funds for refugees. These rumors moved us. We felt that the refugee summer health fund was indeed the most urgent item in the current refugee fund. Therefore, at the suggestion of a few people, we decided to allocate the proceeds from this charity sale to the refugee summer health fund. In this way, we cooperated with the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Fundraising Committee for Health Funds, and expanded preparations, so we postponed the charity sale from early July to mid-July. This should be expressed as regrettable to all sectors of society!</p>
<p>We roughly categorized the items produced and collected in this charity sale into nine categories: stationery publishing, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, daily necessities, toys, clothing, antiques and calligraphy, produce, meals, and miscellaneous.</p>
<p>Finally, what we should express special gratitude for is that if this charity sale can have good results, the credit should belong to the sponsors of this association and the various industrial and commercial firms participating in this sale. Because in the process of preparation, in addition to the sponsors constantly helping us, the enthusiastic participation of various industrial and commercial firms is also an important help. Currently, judging from the number of large and small industrial and commercial firms participating, there are nearly sixty firms, and the items donated by each firm are not withdrawing costs!</p>
<p>The charity sale opened this morning (the 14th) at the American Women's Club on Jing'an Temple Road. Because of the urgency of the preparation and the weakness of all members, defects are expected. I hope all sectors will not hesitate to give advice!</p>
<h3>From Performing "Women's Apartment" to Charity Sale</h3>
<p>— San Shi</p>
<p>My understanding of "Theatrical Women" came after watching their "Women's Apartment," they work so seriously and perform so seriously.</p>
<p>My further understanding of "Professional Women" came from hearing about their preparations for this charity sale. Why? In my opinion, "Women's Apartment" is their spiritual declaration, and this charity sale is their practice.</p>
<p>At the same time, in my opinion, from "Women's Apartment" to the charity sale, it is not just a declaration and practice, but represents their continuous radical spirit and their courage.</p>
<p>Why? "Women's Apartment" said "to create an ideal living environment for women," and this time they expanded the meaning of this sentence. They are moving from seeking benefits for women to seeking benefits for all people. They have chosen a job that Shanghai urgently needs to do now - to appeal for refugees. Performing "Women's Apartment" was done by a group of them, but this time the scope has been expanded. They are working with all sectors to hold this charity event.</p>
<p>What is the road ahead for "Professional Women"? They have chosen it for themselves, from seeking benefits for women themselves to seeking benefits for refugees.</p>
<p>This road is great and bright!</p>

<h3>Summer Children's Health Camp</h3>
<p>— (Simon)</p>
<p>The facilities are quite comprehensive.</p>
<p>Fees are too expensive and not universal.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Summer Children's Health Camp, organized by four schools including Shanghai Private High School, officially opened a few days ago. The camp is located on a large site at the corner of Chengdu Road and Jing'an Temple Road, belonging to Shanghai Private High School. It was held once last year, so this is the second session.</p>
<p>It is said that the purpose of Shanghai Private High School in organizing the Children's Health Camp is to provide children with pure air, sufficient sunlight, and nutritious food during the two-month vacation, in order to change the environment they have been accustomed to for a long time, regulate their rest and activities, and restore their physical and mental health.</p>
<p>In addition to a few hours of classes each day, the focus is entirely on extracurricular activities. In terms of facilities: sports include swings, slides, rocking horses, seesaws, climbing frames, sandpits, ice skating rinks, small ball fields, basketball courts, gyms, etc.; rest includes pavilions, trellises, shade, sunshades, children's seats, nap rooms, etc.; entertainment includes music rooms, wireless broadcasting machines, movie theaters, etc.; hygiene includes washing rooms, spray baths, sand filters, water sunning devices, drainage devices, and disease prevention, etc.; education includes painting space, children's libraries, children's gardening fields, news boards, education boards, and display boards, etc.; other facilities such as auditoriums, workshops, bedrooms, sick rooms, dining rooms, etc., are all available, and the facilities can be considered comprehensive.</p>
<p>The fee paid by the children is forty yuan, including food and accommodation, nutritional items, books, hairdressing, laundry, etc. Children aged three to fifteen can register for the camp, with a quota of 200 people, from July 8th to August 17th, for a total of forty days. On the opening day, there were already more than 150 children in the camp. According to age, they are divided into three groups: toddler class, children's class, and teenager class. All the children are both boys and girls, but there are more boys. In terms of clothing, the boys are all in yellow shorts and white shirts, and the girls are in Western-style casual wear. The blankets, straw mats, and pillows used on the beds are also brought by the children themselves.</p>
<p>In the building of Shanghai Private High School, the bedrooms are quite neat and clean. At noon, most of the children are reading, reading newspapers, sleeping, and resting inside the house. In the morning and evening, they engage in various sports and games on the playground. Such a life is of course disciplined. In terms of health care, in addition to the director of education, the director of childcare, and clerks handling all affairs, well-known primary and secondary school teachers are hired to provide teaching guidance, and several doctors and nurses are stationed day and night to carry out childcare work, such as supervising hygiene and diagnosing diseases.</p>
<p>In order to allow urban children to change their environment and improve their health during the two-month summer vacation, it is necessary to open a children's health camp, and we certainly cannot criticize it. However, I feel that such an environment at the corner of Chengdu Road and Jing'an Temple Road is not quiet enough, the air may not be fresh, and there are no trees and flowers at all, which is not suitable for running a health camp. In addition, the fee for each person is 40 yuan, an average of one yuan per day, which is quite expensive in the eyes of ordinary people, especially in the current situation. Families below the middle class definitely do not have the ability to send their children to the health camp. Then the so-called healthy environment can only be enjoyed by the children of wealthy families. These two points are the shortcomings.</p>
<p>I remember that before "August 13th," the municipal social bureau jointly organized children's summer camps with the education sector and health authorities every summer. The year before last, it was at Tongji Middle School in Wusong, and the year before last, it was at Lingnan Middle School in Gaojingmiao, Jiangwan. I went to visit both times. Those places are quiet enough. The trees are shady, the air is very fresh, and the surrounding area is full of fields. Children who spend 40 days in the wilderness can of course improve their health. I remember when I went to Gaojingmiao to visit the summer camp the year before last, the Lugouqiao Incident had already occurred, and the atmosphere in Shanghai was very tense. In less than a week, the boys and girls in the summer camp fled to the concession. Two years later, the school buildings of Lingnan Middle School have been completely destroyed by fire, which makes people feel a sense of the past and the present!</p>
<p>In the past, the expenses of the summer camp were partly donated by various organizations, and the entrance fee was only 15 yuan per person. Even 15 yuan was considered too expensive in the eyes of ordinary people, and they could not afford to send their children to the camp. Now that the Shanghai education authorities have moved far away from Shanghai, and private individuals are running health camps, it is inevitable that the fees are more expensive than before. It seems that there was more than one last year, and there was also a children's health camp, but this health camp has been discontinued this year, which shows that there are not many children in this city who can enter the health camp!</p>
<h3>Contributing Strength</h3>
<p>— Jing Song</p>
<p>Having seen the "Special Issue on Charity Bazaar of Goods by Women Professionals" in the Great Beauty Evening News on June 27, it calls on us not to "evade the minimum responsibility of contributing strength if we have strength, money if we have money, and goods if we have goods." It tells us about the most convenient way to buy charitably to help relief efforts. Indeed, "Loving others is loving oneself, and rescuing the distressed is rescuing the country." Moreover, that special issue has already told us: Why has this charity bazaar of goods, which has been brewing for half a year, been able to be prepared only now after so many twists and turns? It is because the ladies in charge are so good, they have seen that student circles, art circles, customs colleagues, and the women's handicraft exhibition and sale recently organized by Ms. Tang Aimei have all been held individually in the past, but they have not been united on a large scale, so that the achievements of this movement are better, the meaning is greater, and all parties can participate.</p>
<p>Having spent more effort, when the "Women Professionals" charity sale was broadcast, the "Beneficial Friends Society" and the "China United Amusement Association" took the lead in jointly advocating it. They also received the support of more than a dozen enthusiastic philanthropists in Shanghai, such as Mr. Chu Qiaqing, and the enthusiastic guidance and participation of people from all walks of life. This movement has already shown the power of collective effort.</p>
<p>We admire the enthusiasm of the "Women Professionals" colleagues, and we fully support their spirit of "sacrificing everything for the charity sale" and their slogan: "Die for the charity sale." With this spirit and this perseverance to show the firm will of the people of Shanghai to rescue the distressed, who can not be moved? I believe that when the charity sale in Hong Kong began, it was only casually initiated by one or two vendors, and it was able to spread immediately to the entire market, to all shops, and even to cause a sensation throughout Hong Kong. And we in Shanghai will undoubtedly be able to surpass the achievements of Hong Kong. Because the "Women Professionals" have been conducting legal procedures for a long time, working hard, preparing properly, and with the generous support of various circles, celebrities, groups, shops, and the authorities of the two concessions, this charity sale will surely bear fruitful results.</p>
<p>I am ashamed that I can only shout a few words from the sidelines to cheer up the atmosphere. As the saying goes, "Playing the drums to cheer up the atmosphere." That is just beating the side drum. Not having strength is also considered "contributing strength."</p>
<p>There are many people who are a thousand or a hundred times stronger than me, and there are also many people who are more enthusiastic than me. Hearing about the help and enthusiasm of various industrial and commercial factories, such as Wing On Company, Commercial Press, World Press, Kaiming Bookstore, various national goods companies, and various pharmacies donating goods one after another, it is really exciting. "Everyone wants to be good. Who is not like me?" We not only hope to donate goods to participate, but also look forward to launching charity sales in various stores one after another, so that this movement is more universal, and we do not mind those who come later surpassing us. Whether they are initiated first or participate later, whether they are held separately or jointly, they are all equally good. We only count the results, regardless of the order in which the flowers bloom. Although we want to reap the harvest, we are even more grateful to those who have worked hard in advance! Everyone is working together with one heart and one mind, regardless of each other, and we see the unity of the people and the power of unity in this charity sale!</p>
<p>Let us unite under the spirit of "sacrificing everything for the charity sale"! With the perseverance of "Die for the charity sale," let us participate in this movement together, raise our hands, and unify our steps.</p>
<h3>Biographical Sketches of Female Ballad Singers</h3>
<p>— Shen You</p>
<p>Ma Rufei and Female Ballad Singing (Part 2)</p>
<p>The two opening chapters, "Yin Prosperity and Yang Decline" and "Fang Qiu Chan's Soul," fully reflect the entire picture of Suzhou female ballad singing at that time, and the central figures of female ballad singing. Among these figures, the most famous were Lu Xiuqing, Fang Qiuchan, and Pan Xiaoyun. Among them, Lu Xiuqing was the most praised at the time. She had "talent," "beauty," and "love," and often "entered and exited the two yamen of Changzhou and Wuxian," and was "known everywhere." In Rufei's unprinted manuscript, there was also an opening chapter called "A Notice," which described the officials' infatuation with Lu Xiuqing:</p>
<p>A notice is posted in Suzhou</p>
<p>The women's ballad singing venue is instantly empty</p>
<p>Xu Shuzhen seems to smile but not smile</p>
<p>People have connections everywhere to organize</p>
<p>Not living in Suzhou, not caring</p>
<p>Lu Xiuqing's three words attract people's love</p>
<p>A song on the pipa, a song</p>
<p>Attracts officials and makes them infatuated</p>
<p>Six oceans per session is the regular amount</p>
<p>Three hanging large green toads per session</p>
<p>This time, she is returning home fully loaded</p>
<p>Wang Xueqing happily smokes opium</p>
<p>Almost like Xi Shi in a dream</p>
<p>Fang Qiuchan can speak Suzhou dialect</p>
<p>Without a half sentence of Changshu accent</p>
<p>Shen Xiaomei can be burned as coal</p>
<p>Once went to Hugh Ning to be a wife for the banker</p>
<p>Ju Caiyun loves young age the most</p>
<p>Enticing the family to join in</p>
<p>Secretly, young actors often come and go</p>
<p>Zhu Chunlin and his brothers see</p>
<p>Luo Xiaohai harms her with heavy makeup to cry for her lover</p>
<p>Honest officials save lives like King Bodhisattva</p>
<p>Making that blind old woman who sings blind ballads happy</p>
<p>Almost shaved her hair to become a blind nun</p>
<p>Regardless of whether Rufei's ridicule is true, what can be called the greatest regret is that Rufei has no criticism of the art of these female ballad singers. According to this opening chapter, Lu Xiuqing returned fully loaded after singing female ballads in Suzhou. In fact, this news is not very reliable. She actually ran to Shanghai. Therefore, it is said in "Qing Barn Notes":</p>
<p>During the Xianfeng era, there was Lu Xiuqing, a native of Wu. She came to Shanghai to escape the war. Her appearance was stunning, and her skills were superb, and people scrambled to invite her. Eight gold per song. She came slowly and left gracefully, and her name was very important for a time.</p>
<p>This "Lu Xiuqing" must be the "Lu Xiuqing" that Rufei said. From this clue, it can be inferred that female ballad singing originated in Changshu, first flourished in Su, was banned and then developed in Hu, and gradually developed from "blind women" to "non-blind women." When female ballad singing first started, there were many opponents in all aspects. Ma Rufei, a ballad singer at the time, was one of them, and he did not hesitate to use four opening chapters to attack it. However, thanks to Rufei's attack, we were able to obtain such important historical materials about female ballad singing, and to understand the antecedents of the rise of female ballad singing in Shanghai, and the process of female ballad singing from Changshu to Shanghai's Suzhou overseas Chinese community. After Lu Xiuqing came to Shanghai, her ballad singing gradually developed into a singing venue. The earliest venue was probably the so-called "Chen Nei Tuditang" by Wang Xiaoyun.

<h3>One-Legged Bandit</h3>
<p>— (Yanhua)</p>
<p>"Code of the Secret Service"</p>
<p>Produced by Warner Bros. and screened at the Grand Cathay Theater</p>
<p>Ronald Reagan has played news reporter roles in the past, but recently, he has been engaged in playing the role of the so-called American Secret Service agent. This type of film can be said to be a hybrid of the past Western films and the GIMAN films that are not very fashionable now.</p>
<p>Although Western films and GIMAN films have become a thing of the past, the fighting, gunfighting, and a suffocating atmosphere are loved by the audience.</p>
<p>"One-Legged Bandit" is a hybrid of these two types of films. Although the director added a lot of danger and tension to the entire film, because the story is too simple and there are no foreshadowings, the entire film loses its dramatic flavor. Therefore, even if there are fighting, gunfighting, and other scenes, its tense emotions cannot be connected. Therefore, the entire film also appears scattered and not compact enough.</p>
<p>Ronald Reagan's acting skills and performance skills are still commendable, but without a better story, it is a great loss for an actor.</p>
<h3>The Saint Strikes Back</h3>
<p>— (Ruhua)</p>
<p>"The Saint Strikes Back"</p>
<p>Produced by RKO Pictures and screened at the Grand Shanghai Theater</p>
<p>The appearance of the character "The Saint" is just like the "knight-errant" in old Chinese novels. He relies on his agile body and martial arts to specifically help those in need and draw his sword to help, but he hides his name, as if this world does not care about him. This world is indeed full of darkness, but relying on such an ideal character to "show off" is actually just "self-intoxication."</p>
<p>However, in many "Saint" movies, he often exposes the masks of those who pretend to be serious, so that people can see clearly what kind of bones are hidden in his tuxedo. This cannot but be said to be the painstaking effort of the playwright. Like the lawyer Brick in "The Saint Strikes Back," he is the incarnation of the gangster Wallman.</p>
<p>Several thrilling scenes in this film are not handled well, and because there are too many clues, the director cannot fully depict the saint's wit.</p>
<p>George Sanders, who plays "The Saint," also does not have the humor and wit of Louis Hayward (the former Saint).</p>

<h3>Shang Heyu's Discussion on Drama and Art</h3>
<p>— Zhang Guyu</p>
<p>A few days ago, Mr. Xu Muyun's "Anecdotes of the Pear Garden" talked about Shang Heyu very enthusiastically, but what Mr. Xu talked about was all in the past. As for everything about Shang Lao Dao (Heyu) in recent years, Guyu knows a little more, so I will talk about it briefly now.</p>
<p>Before talking about the main topic, let me first talk about the strengths and weaknesses of Shang Heyu and Yang Xiaolou. Shang is from Baodi. He is a stable person and does not laugh easily. Whenever he meets female actors, he always lowers his head and closes his eyes, so people often call him Shang Lao Dao. Shang has superb skills in the three-character scripture of stability, accuracy, and ruthlessness that martial actors must learn, which Xiaolou does not have. However, Xiaolou is excellent in both voice and appearance, while Shang, with his old-fashioned appearance and hoarse voice, is inevitably inferior. In dramas such as "Qilin Pavilion," "Golden Leopard," "Antian Society," "Battle of Wancheng," and "Lianhuan Tao," Xiaolou is better than Lao Shang. The beauty of Xiaolou's body in "Qilin Pavilion," the amazing white mouth in "Golden Leopard," the agility of his skills in "Antian Society," the wonderful spirit in "Battle of Wancheng," and the clear duet in "Lianhuan Tao" are all things that Lao Shang cannot achieve. But Lao Shang's spirit in "Taking Gao Deng" and "Iron Dragon Mountain," the spirit in "Siping Mountain" and "Pitying the Orangutan," and the precision of his face in these four dramas are all things that Xiaolou sighed at before his death. Xiaolou's old man's plays are better than Shang's, and Lao Shang's martial net plays ("Jia Mengguan" Zhang Fei and "Battle of Wancheng" Dian Wei are the most famous) are something that Xiaolou was conquered by.</p>
<p>Shang is older than Yang, but Yang's spirit on stage is far inferior to Shang's. Yang's wonderful spirit is truly unmatched in the world, while Shang's deep skills are truly unmatched in the future.</p>
<p>Last year, I and a friend once planned to form a new light, and entrusted a friend in Tianjin to meet with Shang. Shang said, "All conditions can be discussed, because I really want to go to Shanghai again, but I must first insist on not taking a foreign ship." The problem lies in the fact that the old man is unwilling to take a foreign ship, the goal was blown, and the new light situation also disintegrated invisibly.</p>
<p>Shang's life in recent years has been unusually difficult, but this old man can endure poverty. When Xiaolou died, Shang once reorganized his troops! He performed in Pingjin, and his momentum was quite strong, but he was soon ignored, and the audience was dismal, almost unable to maintain. But his ambition was not diminished by the lack of harmony. My friend Mr. Chen once visited Shang backstage when Shang performed at the Tianjin China Grand Theater. Shang said, "We who sing operas can sing, and we should serve you gentlemen for a few more years. We can't sing anymore."</p>
<p>Shang has many disciples. In the south, there are Yang Ruiting and Lin Shusen (Yang and Lin are also Shang's adopted sons). In Tianjin, there are Han Changbao, Zhu Xiaoyi, Zhang Defa, Lou Tingyu, Hou Yongkui, and Ding Bingchun. In Beiping, there is a young martial actor Huang Yuanqing. Yang Ruiting's spirit in his later years did indeed coincide with Shang's, but the spirit was far away. Lin Shusen learned the most, but he also learned the least like him. Han Changbao is good in everything, especially under his feet, but unfortunately his typhoon is insufficient and his spirit is not visible. He has been in the Jianghu for a long time and has also been infected with wildness. Zhu Xiaoyi was very good in his early years, but he abandoned himself halfway through his life and now does not know where to stop. Zhang Defa is a martial net. Last year, he performed at the Tianchan Stage in this city, and "Burning Yu Hong" was his best performance. He has Shang's bravery, but lacks Shang's stability and is also crude. Lou Tingyu followed Shang for the longest time, but unfortunately he is not a good material and is not enough to pass on his teacher's mantle. He is now the president of the Tianjin Xiaokeban Jigu Society. Hou Yongkui is from Kunqu opera. His martial arts skills are all good, but unfortunately his eyes are dull and his mouth is weak. In "Five Righteous Men," "Picking the Car," and "Iron Dragon Mountain," in addition to the high soup flavor in the white mouth, (people who sing Kunqu opera have a high soup flavor) there are many similarities to Shang. And his voice is very loud, which is better than his teacher. This child respects Shang very much, and Shang also loves his willingness to work hard. Ding Bingchun is a martial clown, and is a nominal disciple. As for Huang Yuanqing, he is a student of Fuliancheng. His martial arts are very good, and he is good at wearing long-backed armor, but unfortunately he has never grown taller and will at most become a second Han Changbao in the future. Shang's disciples believe that Hou Yongkui is more promising. This photo of Sheng Lin and Yang Shengchun, Zuoying, was specially taken by a photographer from the Ten Days Drama Society when Shang performed in Tianjin last year.</p>

<h3>Words of a Bad Guy (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Wang Xianzai</p>
<p>(1) Bad guys can't be done</p>
<p>My film career began in the eleventh year of the Republic. At first, in the Star Film Company's "Orphan Saving Ancestor," I played a villain named Lu Shoujing. I thought I had a lot of "experience" and volunteered to play this "bad guy." After the film was made, I was pleasantly surprised and received a lot of praise. From then on, I never played a film that didn't play a "bad guy." Every director thought it was a "good show" and wanted me to do it this way. I was just happy to do so and liked to give the bad guy all kinds of vivid and ugly descriptions.</p>
<p>I have played all kinds of ugly characters in the bad guy category, from corrupt officials, bandits, and hooligans to lowly officials, local tyrants, evil gentry, and even cunning servants. I have played a lot of them. The performance results are another matter. But after each character was assigned, I had done a lot of "internship" work. For example, when filming the exterior scenes of "Story of Jin Yan," I spent a lot of time in the small teahouses in Tianqiao, Beijing, and met a friend of this kind. In "Eternal Smile," I played a rascal drunkard, and the lower-level hotels were also my daily haunts. Several times, I drank one cup after another and almost lost consciousness. Some people argue that acting should be suitable for the personality of the audience, which is of course very right. But as for my humble opinion as an actor, it is not entirely true. I think that an actor's acting skills should belong to all aspects, and actors of all levels, upper, middle, and lower, should be able to play well in order to be considered a true achievement. Otherwise, it is not people acting in a play, but simply a play acting in people. On this point, although I am far from the topic and have not been able to do it, I have never given up such an extravagant hope in my heart.</p>
<p>In the play "Cao Cao Forcing the Palace" on stage, there used to be a danger of eating sugarcane orange peels in large quantities. When arousing the audience's passionate excitement, it is inevitable to do so. Playing "bad guys" on the screen often has similar encounters. When I was discovered running on the streets in Shanghai, it was "commonplace" to be pointed and cursed. A few years ago, when filming on location in Beiping, people often met on a narrow road and cursed "Motherfucker! Bad guy." They were even so fierce that they wanted to make things difficult for me. When I met these simple-minded "enthusiastic friends," I could only nod, smile, and run away. If I were to take them seriously, it would be obvious that I would suffer a loss.</p>
<p>After the war, I went to Sichuan and spent more than a year of wandering life. This "bad guy" of mine also often ran into walls everywhere and had a hard time speaking. What's even more ridiculous is that there was a lawsuit I had before, and the other party pointed out in court: "Just looking at his evil and unscrupulous performance on the screen can prove that he is definitely not a good person!" As a rebuttal, I felt even more dumbfounded and speechless.</p>
<p>Being a film actor, the villain role is much more disadvantaged in this regard. Therefore, I have this feeling: a person should be a good person, otherwise he will cut himself off from the crowd, and the result will be "this road is blocked" and there will be no good results.</p>
<h3>Ann Sothern Chosen as Sex Symbol</h3>
<p>— New Film</p>
<p>— Unanimous Recommendation from Journalists and Writers —</p>
<p>A girl from De Soto Parish, Louisiana, who is very tall, has a husky voice, and cannot be considered extremely beautiful, now wears the crown of a sex symbol because of her dazzling red hair. Her name is Ann Sothern. Originally, the acknowledged sex symbol in Hollywood was Jean Harlow, but now this title has been unequivocally transferred to Ann Sothern's head. Ann Sothern's selection as a sex symbol this time is due to the unanimous recognition and recommendation of general stars, including stars who film in rival film companies, producers, film technical staff, script writers, hairdressers, designers, and newspaper and magazine writers.</p>
<p>Why did Ann Sothern receive this honor? The main reason is that no one walks better than her. She always has a smile on her face. Her curves, her husky voice, her frankness, and her sociability can induce even a very strong person to be seduced and fall at her feet. She is a very vibrant woman. She came to Hollywood from De Soto Parish after winning a beauty contest. She is very straightforward and admits to being chosen as a sex symbol.</p>
<p>According to Ann Sothern, she herself does not believe that she often has a sexy performance. She opposes the general view that sex appeal is a talent and cannot be created through acquired means. Anyone can do it. So-called sex appeal is a combination of beauty and personality, especially important is fitness, and it must also be accompanied by some humor. Ann Sothern believes that sex appeal is a quality that makes people happy. You have to know how people like you and don't be afraid to meet people. Make people imagine you are binding them.</p>
<p>The second important quality is being able to be self-aware. If a woman is too shy, she will make others shy, and as a result, no one will joke with her. Shyness will lead to dullness. Sometimes self-aware women occasionally think that men's self-awareness should be ten times that of women. Finally, Ann Sothern pointed out several secrets to becoming a sexy woman: (1) Don't be unhappy because a man went out with you once and didn't make a date for a second outing, because you can't necessarily make everyone like you. (2) On the other hand, don't overdo your happiness when he makes a date for you to go out a second time. (3) Don't laugh wildly in front of a man when he is unhappy. (4) Don't forget that all men will think that women who are too beautiful are dangerous. (5) Don't think that you can become sexy with your own power alone. The main thing is to be able to seduce people and grasp them. (6) Finally, a woman should never discuss the issue of sex appeal with men.</p>

<h3>Unofficial Records of the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Xu Biyun Offends the Taboo of the White Tiger in the Pear Garden</p>
<p>Shandong people are ultimately honest and kind. Master Meng Si saw that Biyun was temporarily unable to perform and feared that he would get sick from being idle, so he secretly took out a large sum of money to have him co-manage the former Wai Zhonghe Theater with their master (Lanyuan). At first, other actors performed the main plays, and the business was fairly stable, enough to cover expenses. Later, as time went on, he thought that society might have forgotten his past misdeeds, so he boldly hung up his own shingle and performed the main plays himself. Who knew that the business would plummet, much worse than before. Some say that since he was punished with hard labor, the people of Beiping despised his character, so everyone was unwilling to listen to his plays. However, according to the superstitious people in the Pear Garden, "Because three White Tigers clashed, Xu Laosi's spirit was destroyed. The so-called three White Tigers are: (1) Zhonghe Garden is the only White Tiger Stage in the old capital (stages facing west, south, and north are all auspicious, such as Jixiang Garden in the east of the city facing west, Tongle in Menkuang Hutong outside Qianmen facing south, and Huale in Xianyu Kou outside Qianmen facing north. Zhonghe is the only theater in the whole city with its stage facing east. Because the landlord was a flower farmer named Xue, who was an amateur and stubborn, this special White Tiger Stage was built. People in the Pear Garden always say that the left is the Azure Dragon and the right is the White Tiger, the Azure Dragon brings good fortune, and the White Tiger brings misfortune. The stage's exit door is the Azure Dragon, and the entrance door is called the White Tiger. In the past, when Lao Tan was alive, he was very superstitious. Every time he attended a hall meeting or on the first day of a performance, he would always perform the play "Dingjun Mountain" because the leading actor in his plays usually entered from the entrance door, but this play alone entered from the exit door, which meant going from the Azure Dragon and not from the White Tiger. Later, Shu Yan and Fu Ying also followed suit, which shows that the Pear Garden is very taboo about the White Tiger.) (2) Biyun's qin player Lama (Zhao Jigeng) is a White Tiger qin (holding the qin in his right hand and pulling the bow with his left hand). Biyun himself has the nickname of Little White Tiger. (Some say he was born in the year of the Tiger.) Originally, one White Tiger Stage was enough to scare many famous actors from performing in Zhonghe, let alone the main actor and the qin player being all White Tigers. —(59)—</p>
