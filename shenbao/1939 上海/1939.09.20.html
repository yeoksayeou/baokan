<h3>蘇德開始宣傳　威脅波羅的海　謂某國藏匿波潛艇　立陶宛外長晤蘇使</h3>
<p>莫斯科　列寗格拉報吿稱、應可靠消息、波蘭潛水艇現方潛匿波羅的海某某數國港內、並得某某政府人員之秘密援助、又據接到消息、上述各港內、除波蘭潛艇外、尙有某某他國潛艇藏匿、九月十八日，並有原來被鋼於愛沙尼亞國塔林港之波蘭潛艇一艘、突然逃逸無踪、據信此事乃愛沙尼亞當局縱容陰助之結果、蘇聯波羅的海艦隊司令部現巳採取措施、俾防止潛匿波羅的海潛艇騷擾行動、（十八日塔斯電）</p>
<p>愛沙尼亞京城　愛沙尼亞海軍司令米爾、與海軍參謀長林納斯脫、巳於今日由總統與以免職處分、此為調查波蘭潛艇「奧齊爾」號自此間海港逃逸事件後之第一項措置、為愛沙尼亞總司令所建議云、（十八日海通電）</p>

<h3>波蘭總統　告民衆書　今後仍奮𩰚復國</h3>
<p>巴黎　波蘭國總統莫錫基、率同政府人員避往羅馬尼亞國之後、頃於昨日發出文吿波蘭民衆書、由波國駐法大使館予以發表、內稱「德國兵力遠在我國之上、此乃盡人皆知之事、當此我國軍隊正以無上勇氣、對德抗戰之際、我國東　、竟乃乘我之危、侵入我國領土、而置現行條約與道義原則於不願、證諸史乘、我國兩面受敵、原已不管先例、今茲又遭兩重侵略、夫復何言、但吾人已與苒法兩國成立同盟條約、今後仍當為公理文明而戰、以戰勝強　與野蠻、金並相信、吾人必能獲存最後服務生、在此艱難奮圖之時期、保持波蘭共和國之機構、乃屬必要之舉、因此、余雖創鉅痛深、仍復決定將總統府曁其他重要機關遷往安全地帶、俾得繼續行使完全主權、並注視共和國利益、今後如何保持民族光榮、願與國人共免之在云、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>荷屬東印　充實防務</h3>
<p>海牙　荷屬東印度海防委員會所繕具之報告、今日公布、該報吿主張建造二萬五千噸至三萬噸之快巡洋戰艦裝置二十八生的米達之砲、並主張擴大泗水軍港、（十九日路透電）</p>
<p>德蘇陰謀瓜分波蘭圖</p>
<p>倫敦　每日電報外交記者據蘇聯方面消息、謂蘇聯進兵波蘭、志在佔據彼蘭東部全境、至所謂　寇松綫、為止、換言之、即由格洛特諾起、經過皮亞里斯多克·白萊斯特立托夫斯克·泊士米塞爾三處而至喀爾巴阡山為止、按此「寇松綫」即一九二〇年英國所主張新建波蘭國東部邊界、如蘇聯在波蘭南方如願以償、則烏克蘭全境將盡列入蘇聯疆界之內矣、就蘇聯方面言論察之、莫斯科殊無劃定德蘇共同邊界之意、蘇聯始終欲成立一波蘭緩衝國、惟蘇聯此種舉動、巳吾根據莫斯科近所成立之協定、獲有德國之同意、則目前尙難斷定、尙有一事亦可推想而知者、耶蘇聯不欲見德國在黑海之濱、厚植其勢力、今土耳其外長薩拉卓格魯之往遊莫斯科、殆以黑海防務合作為最大旨趣、故泛論之、蘇聯似在東南西三面採行保護的地位、除被第三强國如德國者所威脅之鄰地外、不欲擴張其邊界云、（十九日路透電）</p>
<h3>巴爾幹形勢　土耳其大使晤法外長　南斯拉夫派使訪蘇聯</h3>
<p>巴黎　土耳其國大使蘇亞特頃於今晨會晤外交部决長特里勃、相與長談之後、消息靈通人士極為滿意、據稱、「土國政府之立塲、並不因國際時局發生變化而有所燮更、可於此見之、英法土三國關於締結互助協定之談判、仍在順利進行中、土國外長薩拉的格魯前往莫斯科、乃係探詢性質、絕無其他作用、此行所可蒐集之情報，不特有益於土國、抑且為英法兩國所樂於知悉、」此外某方面傳出消息、謂土國政府或當禁止英法兩國軍艦通過達達尼爾、博斯破魯斯兩海峽、俾蘇聯得以經由多瑙河以各種物品接濟德國、不致為英法兩國軍艦所攔截云、（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>南斯拉夫京城　此聞盛傳政府業巳派一專使、携帶秘密使命前往英斯科、有所探詢、某某方面預料南國對俄政策即將改絯易轍、半官方面對於此種傳聞、旣不予吾認、亦未加以證實、（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>南斯拉夫京城　攝政保祿親王今晨頒佈命令、以全權賦予政府、俾克於必耍時修正現行法律或頒佈新法律、直至新衆議院成立為止、（按衆議院前於本年八月廿七日解散之後、何時舉行改選、迄未決定）但政府依照此項全權所採取之各項措置、均應於日後提付衆院追認之、（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>希特勒到但澤　發表演說　醜詆凡爾賽和約</h3>
<p>但澤　希特勒今日行抵但澤波蘭邊境、但澤國社黨首領孚斯德巳在該處迎候、並代表但澤人民向希特勒表示感謝、希氏答稱、余今日能於本巿重歸德國之後、相遇於此、至感愉快云、二氏遂互相握手、孚氏向民衆致辭後、希氏乃開始演說云、目擊此偉大之解放時日者、不僅為爾等但澤之人民、且為全世界之人民、此時不祗繭等感覺快樂全體德國人民皆莫不如是、余本身亦自覺此時之偉大、余現正第一决踐踏於德人僑居巳歷五六百年之土地、上决世界大戰、實為自來戰事中之最無意義者、遂犧牲本市及此一片土地、該决戰事中、實屬人人失敗，而無一人獲勝、遂使人人皆有一種信心、認為此項命運、決不使之重演於他日、德國之加入上决大戰、實毫無戰爭目的、不過希望隨後之和平、能使德國恢復、並取銷一切痛苦、不料結果、竟不出於自由談判、而反以凡爾賽和的加諸德國之人民、當時之窮兵黷武者、不但未解決此軍純之問題、且更創造無數新問題、被壓迫之德國、不甘長此屈服、自將再度崛起、以解決新創造之問題、凡爾賽和的忽視德國為擁有八千二百萬人民之國家此項人民皆願生活、並將永遠生活也、希氏叉稱、再逾五十年、波蘭即將返至野蠻主義之地步、波蘭實從未成為民治國家，其人民皆受橫暴當局之壓迫云、（十九日路透電）</p>
<h3>日本各報　論調各殊</h3>
<p>東京　日日新聞系報紙謂、德蘇現行條的、能維持幾時、殊成疑問、故波蘭之瓜分、未必能加强德蘇間友好關係、其實鳥克蘭終將成為兩國間爭點云、素來主張與軸心國成立軍事同盟之報知新聞、則乘機大唱共加强日德義關係以造成不利於英國的新秩序之說、都新聞謂、日蘇休戰協定吿成、蘇聯乃集中力量於歐洲、英法亦退出遠東舞臺、至是包圍日本之政策、遂隨之破裂、此誠日政府千載一時之機會、亟起為之、即可完成東亞新秩序云、中外商業新聞勸政府調整其對蘇全部關保、謂如此定有助於中國戰事之解決云、（十九日路透電）</p>
<h3>德蘇瓜分波蘭密約</h3>
<p>倫敦　此間外交界主管人士現皆相信、德蘇兩國之間曾經成立協定、在波蘭國境內劃分勢力範圍、但此項協定係在上月二十四日雙方簽訂互不侵犯條的之時成立、抑在事後成立、尙難確悉、蘇聯政府深恐德國不顧協定、而將整個波蘭藝括而去爰乃忽出兵波蘭、以實現上項協定所載明之瓜分辦法、德國殆已承認蘇聯有權佔據鳥克蘭與白俄縱斯兩族所聚居之地、一俟波蘭瓦解、幷當進一步設置獨立的小規模的波蘭國、以為德蘇兩國問之緩衝國、此種波蘭國當擁有人口一千八百萬人、而受德蘇兩國之控制、但在正式成立之前、波蘭領土之未經蘇聯佔領者、均當暫由德國佔據之云、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>愛沙尼亞京城　據可靠消息，德蘇兩瞬曾經訂立秘密協定、其大要如次、（一）定雙方瓜分波蘭後之新界綫（二）波蘭境內鳥克蘭與白俄羅斯兩族所聚居之地、得由蘇聯佔領之、（三）設置小規模波蘭國、以之作為蘇維埃聯邦所屬社會主義共和國之一、亦即以之作為蘇聯「保護地」、蘇聯外交人民委員長莫洛托夫咋日所發表之演說嘗謂、一波蘭人民處於水深火熱之境地、蘇聯政府準備予以拯救」云云、殆即指此而言、至德蘇兩國主張將小波蘭國作為蘇聊保護地之用意、乃欲造成一種局勢、務使西歐各國、苟非對蘇宣戰、即無從賡續用兵、關於此層、據聞德國外長里賓特洛浦深信、英法兩國在此種情勢之下、決不致拒絕希特勒元首所當提出之停戰建議、此項建議屆時並當以哀的美頓書方式出之、英法兩國若果予以拒絕、則希特勒元首即當毫不　疑荷蘭國、或同時假這其他某某中立國、以迅雷不及掩耳之手段向法國進攻、觀於荷蘭國境內多數德國工廠之職員、業由德國軍事當局召回柏林、吿以政府亟需通曉荷蘭語言之古人、可見上項傳聞、或非完全無稽也云、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>莫斯科　蘇德兩國頃會同發表公報如下、「蘇聯及德意志兩國政府、為防止關於蘇德兩國軍隊在波蘭行動之各種無稽謠傳起見、茲特宜言、兩國軍隊目的、絕無違反德蘇聯利益、或與蘇德互不侵犯條的之精神與文宇、有何衝突之處、反之、各該國軍隊之任務、為恢復波蘭境內因該國崩潰而被擾亂之和平與秩序、並襄助波蘭人民重行建設其國家存在之條件」云、（十八日塔斯電）</p>
<h3>甘地擁護英國主張</h3>
<p>倫敦　印度西北郁彭迦勃省前任省長海萊勛爵、頃於本日晚間發表廣播演說、略謂、印度之與英國合作、以應付歐洲時局、意義極其重大、印度國民黨對於德國政策所具目標、絕未表示同淸、甘地素昔痛惡戰爭、今茲又認為英國所作主張、極其正當、印度應無條件加以援助、猶憶印度在上次歐戰時、曾自動召募軍隊至一百五十萬員名之多、其中派往海外作載者、共達一百二十五萬員名，幷以三百五十萬噸糧食、接濟英國、其態度之忠誠、自巳不霄可喻云、（右圖係甘地與尼赫魯）（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>英法對蘇聯</h3>
<p>波蘭抗德，脆弱有如枯朽，每戰皆北，為時不及二旬，首都已入重圍，疆土淪陷者四之三。英法攘臂赴援，重兵雖入德境，猶膠着於西格斐陣綫之外。此以英法波三國對德戰爭之全局言之，茲纔發軔耳，最後決勝之點在於德國西陲；然波蘭方面之戰局，則至是旣有末路之觀矣。乃蘇聯復於此際，排闥直入，兵不血刃，所至披靡，於是波蘭東部盡入蘇聯掌握，窮蹙愈甚；然波蘭固猶有其政府土地人民軍隊以及政治機構，凡國家所應有者，無不有也。據軍事專家之觀察：德國之西格斐陣綫絕非堅不可拔，然英法聯軍完成其進攻西格斐之準備而大舉摧毀之，至少尙須三月。三月非甚久，不幸波蘭形勢岌岌不可終日。據昨日之消息：波蘭軍隊，已暴露全部崩潰之現象矣；波蘭政府自總統以决之高級官員，曁統帥以决之高級將領，相繼出奔而至中立之鄰國羅馬尼亞矣；河山變色，人民不知所依歸矣。然則不必談三數月，英法聯軍即使明日便能踏平西格斐陣綫，浩浩蕩蕩，進迫柑林，而波蘭東為蘇聯控制，西成德國尾閭，亦已難乎其為國家；若謂重整旗鼓，恢復規模，不渺茫耶？謂不渺茫。惟待德國國社政權崩潰。德不崩潰；詎能妥協而別留『夾縫』，以予波蘭容身。</p>
<p>凡右所陳，初非詛咒波蘭；蓋波蘭雖為不能理解公道，不知尊重正義之國家，抑且為甘與傀儡為伍之國家，然吾人固猶深憫其今茲之遭遇。凡右所陳，復非承認武力所造之現實；然以為糾正現實者，必於『波蘭總統莫錫基泣告國民』，吾認現實，共勉方來之外，別求切實有效之途徑。顧途徑安在乎？英法而堅持其意願，且實力足以副之，自是糾正現實之途徑，亦是波蘭復國之途徑，是不待論。英法或心餘而力絀，乃得他國助成之，是亦途徑，亦不待論。雖然，大局大變，英法意願是吾務貫初衷，迄記者評述之時為止，未聞英法有何決定。英法對於蘇聯之遣軍入波，雖謂『並非意料以外之事』，然如何應付其事，則非胸有成竹；二三日來之躊躇疑慮徬徨苦悶，不可掩也。我人誠不知英法將如何決定，但以為任何國家立國施政之原則，要在力行國策，義無返顧，而不容輕率更張，出爾反爾；獨於大局大變之際，自有重行考慮國策之必要，然後決定國策變更或吾。英法茲在玫慮之中歟！</p>
<p>英法所攷慮者，所關之方面甚多，所生之後果逈異，而影響所及則極大。誠以英法對德宣戰，具有複雜之論據；其間以踐行義務，援助波蘭，為主要論據之一端。波蘭目前之狀態，雖事實上瀕於消失其為國家，然理論上依然存在；夫使危者安，使覆者復，皆在援助範圍之內，是英法義務依然存在也。義務所在，應惟侵略是問，則何辨於德國或蘇聯。何况置蘇聯於不問，則非但無以自解於義務，且波蘭若於某種方式之下，形似亡於蘇聯，則英法繼續對德戰爭，詎復有何意義。於是言之，英法而不變更其國策者，除對蘇聯宣戰之外，別無他途。及至昨晚，英法對蘇聯，固未宣戰；更據倫敦電訉，英法僅擬會同對蘇聯抗議，此外暫不作何舉動云，抗議而不宣戰，雖謂國策業已變更，亦無不可；藉日抗議之後，猶得宣戰，然於其應宣未宣之際，雖謂國策暫告停滯，亦無不可。</p>
<p>英法國策無論為停滯或變更，未許遽責英法以怯弱或背信。何也？英法若對蘇聯宣戰，則不但驅蘇德沆瀣一氣，有如昨論；軍略如何制勝乎，經濟猶得封鎖乎，皆是絕大問題。抑允不僅如此而已，英法戰德，猶得使戰局保持其一時期之簡單；若英法與蘇德成為交戰之二團體，則勝負旣難逆覩，而勝負之影響將遍及於歐洲其他各國之利害安危存亡；是以各國無論為目前之各種關係，或為他日之深刻影響，絕對無法繼續保守其中立，行見踵英法對蘇聯宣戰之後者，各國必立即相繼參戰；如東南歐各國，如波羅的海各國，如巴爾幹各國，允如義大利西班牙葡萄牙各國，無一而得置身事外。各國參戰，則友敵之分野如何？邀為友，則利害不矛盾乎，條件如何？樹為敵，則得失不相償乎，軍略如何？凡是者，英法俱應考慮，而有足使英法國策根本變更或暫時停滯者也。</p>
<p>戰爭，至殘酷，至慘痛，超越理智之行為也；惟關存亡，實逼處此，不得不戰如中國者，始為神聖之戰；顧亦於戰爭持續之中，敵軍深入之日，萬衆一心之候，備受蹂躪之餘，雖深信勝利具有把握，猶望日本放棄侵略，撒兵言和。况若英法對德尙未主力接觸，對蘇尙未決定宣戰，對歐洲各國甚至他洲他國尙有無限延擴可能；於此時也，誠得與德國蘇聯，各抑情感，共伸理智，相的捐棄一部分之意念欲求，相期容許各民族之自由生存，而避免最殘酷最慘痛之兵連禍結，固理智之論所應及時努力者也。英法暫時停滯其國策，德國與蘇聯不亦應知終凶之義而猛回頭乎！</p>

<p>江陰漢奸先後被華方擒獲伏法者、有吳利用·高雪琴·楊漢卿·許慕韓·許孟金等、不下數十名、於是羣奸震驚、惶恐萬狀、近有深自悔悟、而請自首者甚衆、日宣撫班及憲兵隊、以各該漢奸毫無工作表現、頗滋疑竇、甚或懷疑與游擊隊暗通聲氣、動輒捕押、且刑迫口供、前日某特務人員在北城外君山馬路、捕獲漢奸金彩雲一名、聞金素充日宣撫班情報員、平日頗為日人所信賴、</p>

<h3>偽滿政府　實施統制大豆貿易　大連遭颶風襲損失極巨</h3>
<p>字林報九月十日大連通訊云、東三省外籍與日籍大豆出口商、久恐大豆買賣、全被統制、今「滿政府」卒定十一月一日起、實施此種完全統制矣、大豆統制公司、卽將成立、專營大豆及大豆產物、不僅大豆本身、卽豆餅與豆油、亦將被統制、預料統制榨油之公司、亦將成立、此舉乃「政府」之又一壟斷、而使私人無從經營、對於費時數十載始使其商業達目前繁榮狀况之外國商行、似不致准予某種活動範圍、此種計劃、必多反對者、如以前討論此項計劃時然、惟於事有無裨益、留待異日覘之、</p>

<h3>南京路上空前盛况　八一三戰后之新紀錄　大昌祥綢縀局大開幕</h3>
<p>大昌祥綢縀局。為旅滬巨商所組織。經理曹鳳聲君長袖善舞。在綢緞業中索有地位。今春曾受盤前南京路山西路口之大昌恊記綢緞局之全部底貨。不久卽照盤價舉行底貨大拍賣。轟動一時。該局自拍賣工作。結束以後。即將陳舊門面。重新加以改造。成為立體化最漂亮量時式之摩登門面。富麗堂皇。冠絕羣倫。而且地點適中。遠近皆便。故雖在裝修期間。各界仕女。引領盼望。紛紛電詢。開幕日期者。日必多起。曹君以布置未竣。婉言相的。可見社會注意之一般。因曹君與滬地殷富巨室。多有往還。閨閣名媛。交識頗多。故高尙主顧。自動惠顧。而其部下職員。叉多綢緞業中素具經騐學識者。故能一經號召。一鳴驚人矣，</p>
<p>昨日為大昌祥綢緞局正式大開幕之第一天。早晨七時。南京路山西路口卽已萬頭鑽動。擁擠不堪。車馬交通。幾至斷絕。揭幕後。勢如湧潮。一霎時。寬大店堂。已無隙地。幸該號準備多數職員。雖覺擁擠過甚。乃可從容應付。而女太太們多有忍飢耐暑。以求得此意外便宜貨者。無不滿意而歸云。</p>
<p>大昌祥綢緞局為紀念正式開幕起見。特發售紀念犧牲品旗袍料數千件。此種旗袍料。每件照成本須數元以上。現在只賣一元。惟須先取得犧牲品之優待券。方可購買。而優待券之取得。殊有限制。但凡為該號老全顧。或有相當交易者當然有此優待也。此種犧牲品如以昨日之營業盛况比例計之。恐已所餘無旣。捷足先得。不可或綏也。南京路在滬市為中心區域。商業薈萃。八一一三後。久已無此盛况。今得大昌祥綢緞局驚人偉舉。為戰後剏新記錄。駸駸乎巳執本市綢緞業之牛耳矣。</p>

<h3>蘇州河北　日軍防區略伸展　北江西路展至北河南路　在此區域內不架鐵絲綱　滬西越界築路地段偽警增多</h3>
<p>日偽軍警在滬西越界築路有所舉動之後、外界即盛傳日軍方面、將要求英軍自蘇州河以北撤退、而由日軍接防、該區域包括自北江西路以迄北西藏路止之地段、於是居住蘇州河以北之人民、咸惴惴不安、各商號仔儲於蘇州河以北各銀行之堆棧內貨物、近紛紛遷運、五金號·鐵行·等、亦將値價之五金鐵料、搬運至蘇州河之南、證之日軍司集各國在滬防軍畏官會議之事實、益使人心不安、</p>
<p>日軍防區　略予伸展</p>
<p>乃昨日下午、突傅日軍將於明日實行將蘇州河以北之區域、全部接受、記者為求明事實之眞相起見、特向有關各方探訪該項消息之是否否確實、茲已獲得可靠之消息、證明上項之謠傅、並非事實、但亦非無因、緣月之二十二日起、日軍在蘇州河以北之防區、確將略予伸展、由北江西路展至北河南路、此種事實、則已確定、英國駐軍屆時將由北江西路撤退至北河南路之西、</p>
<p>伸展區域　無障碍物</p>
<p>但經雙方規定、此决日軍所伸展之區域、並不架設鐵絲網等障碍物、僅由日軍派隊巡邏而巳、查在八一三戰事以前、滙司捕房與虹口捕房、原以北河南路為界、虹口捕房管轄至北河南路東西階沿為止、自戰後虹口成為戰事狀態地、故由匯司捕房接管虹口捕房轄區之一部、至北四川路為止、自虹口捕房回復警務原狀後、此項辦法、依舊繼續、今决之變更、實係回復原來之狀態而已、</p>
<p>滙司捕房　吿慰住戶</p>
<p>匯司捕房為安定居住北河南路東半面住戶人心起見、已派員向各居戶將原則曉諭、囑仍安心居住、母相驚擾、即使日軍前來調查、亦囑將實際情形相告、如有警務上事件仍可電告捕房、捕房自當仍予辦理也，據記者另得一消息、謂在不久時日、接連閘北邊界之鐵門、將開放、使至閘北之人無須繞道、但此說之是否屬實，一時尙難證明，須俟將來事實之證明也、故居住於蘇州河以北之居民、均可安心矣、</p>
<p>雙方交涉　尙無結果</p>
<p>關於越界築路問題、記者昨特往訪英領事署某重要官員、據稱日方對租界當局之壓迫、自歐戰發生以後、益為積極、最近復欲取得越界築路之警權、掦言將以武力解決、多所壓迫、工部局方面、為緩和事態計、遂與日偽開始談判但迄今未見有何結果云云、記者繼詢以越界築路交涉、外傳可於十日或半月以內商得解决、該氏則並未予以堅决吾認、</p>
<p>一部探捕　業已撤退</p>
<p>工部局方面、雖已否認於十七日晨起、放棄滬西越界築路區域警權、但大中社記者昨日下午赴該區實地視察、見白利南路。極司非而路。曹家渡一帶租界巡捕、幾巳完全撤退、指揮交通任務、皆已改由偽警擔任、但悉園路上仍有租界巡捕駐守、各里弄口、除中實新村·四明別墅·由偽警看弄外、其他各弄、仍由捕房志願警看守、以工部局與日偽方面、必有相當默契也、昨日越界築路地帶、日偽方面便衣隊密布、居民行人、均惴惴不安、皆相戒謹愼發言、可見該區情形、實際上巳改觀矣、</p>
<p>佈崗偽警　突然增多</p>
<p>悉園路中實新四明別墅弄口所駐之偽警、仍僅一人、惟漁光村對面之錢家巷、則突增為八名、愚園路一二四九號豐田紗廠職工宿舍門首所駐偽警四名、昨仍如舊、白利南路兆豐公園大門旁、咋駐偽警、仍為三名、至原有之捕房所派看門巡捕二名、昨忽絕跡、惟公園遊客、往來仍不少、極司非而路上自愛文義路口起、沿途如康家橋·金家巷·馬路橋·康腦脫路·直至曹家渡·連日以來、均有偽警佈崗駐守、昨日各崗、偽警均突然增多、武裝偽警、列隊由班長領導、來往巡閱、意態昂然、沿街市民、均側目而視、又三義坊門首、亦有偽警四名、新設崗位、</p>
<p>租界邊區　戒備加嚴</p>
<p>海格路四四八號林氏巨厦、經日偽佔據、即在該屋東面闢側門一道、並堆置沙袋、佈崗駐守、但自前日起、側門忽封鎖不通、仍改由大門進出、昨日復將側門畔之沙袋拆去、改在大門前另行建築防禦工事、並派武裝偽警六七駐守、揣其用意、似為集中力量、守衛大門、海格路上、則法捕房之鐵甲車、巡邏更見繁密、並有大隊安南巡捕隨車步行前進、沿途搜查可疑行人及車輛、</p>
<p>英軍防區　略有變更</p>
<p>至調整各國駐軍防區問題、據英領署某重要官員、語大中社記者、自本月十三日日海軍陸戰隊司令安、召集英美意駐軍司令會議、徵詢各國司令之同意、嗣後各關係國即進行商談、日方之提出調整防區、其根據係因上次調整以後、至今巳有兩年、按之成例、此次應再加調整、故各國對之、並無異議、英美兩國、均巳相繼表示同意、今日所欲討論者、非為應否調整、而為調整之具體方案之內容如何、即如何調整而巳、但迄今日方與英美方面、尙未有提出具體方案、故調整各國駐軍防區、在短期內、當不致即行實現、現英方對日方欲接收北江西路至北河南路一帶英軍防區一點、提出條件兩項、（一）該防區不由日方塡防、（二）居民出入、不得使用通行證、現日方對此尙未有何表示、惟盛傳英軍有於二十二日讓防說、</p>
<p>傅法領將　訪傅筱庵</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、據日文「大陸新報」載稱、預料駐滬法總領事鮑黛芝、不日將訪「市長」傳筱庵、對於特二法院以及法祖界公董局與「上海市府」間其他未決問題、作和睦之討論、此等間題、乃有不久可得滿意解決之望、自八月二十一日起、駐滬法副領事卡丹特巳迭在市中心區「市府」辦公室與傳氏磋商、</p>
<p>赫德大將　昨日返靑</p>
<p>九月十四日上午、日方邀集駐滬各國防軍司令會議、是日下午、美國駐華艦隊總司令赫德上將、即遄程由靑搭乘伊薩培爾號艦來滬、於十五日上午十一時到達、會晤美國駐滬總領事高斯、外問遂信赫德上將之突然來滬、必與防軍會議有關、有待赫氏提供意見也、茲悉赫氏巳於昨（十九）日下午三時、乘原艦北上返靑、而來滬任務、尙未有所宜露、</p>

<p>滬甬輪往來絡繹滬溫郵包未恢復歐戰爆發後、行駛歐洲遠東間之船隻、為維持中立起見、一部份船公司拒絕交戰國人民附乘各輪、惟記者探悉、本埠瑞士商之維昌洋行所經營之船隻如北平·南京·寗波·山東·馬葛拉·等輪船、雖因戰事影響、或將停駛歐亞、但該洋行之輪隻、對交戰國人民、並不拒絕載運、聞該洋行一部份船隻、將改在上海另行規定航綫、</p>
<p>滬甬輸運滬溫航錢、上週一度復航、今又遭日海軍阻撓、以致復吿斷航、滬甬綫近來貨運尙稱不惡、故一再加輪航行、中意公司新加入行駛之海達輪、昨日下午四時首决赴甬、魯麟洋行船務部飛康輪、定今日下午復航滬甬綫、遠東公司哈納輪、定明日續航鎭海口、禮和洋行謀福輪、於上週五返滬、對於續航鎭海、至昨日尙未决定、德平輪定二十五日返申、的二十七·八續航鎭海、中意公司大埔輪、的二十五日抵滬後、亦擬參加滬甬綫、海福·賣利兩輪、隨德平輪後回滬、駛甬日期、須輪到後方可决定、</p>

<h3>天津四華人案　英按署未判決　四人業已引渡無能爲力　呈請人將來或不致上訴</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、關於天津四華籍恐怖嫌疑犯事、英國駐華按察使署對於保護人身法之傳達狀、尙未判決、今十九日晨報載之訊不確、</p>
<p>大陸報云英國駐華按察使署推事瓊思、上星期三日結束鬨動一時的測騐英國法律之案件、判决對於天津刺程案四華籍嫌疑犯、决不能發保護人身法令狀、俾將彼等提至英國法庭、因四犯均非英國人民也、昨（十八日）悉、呈請人對於此項判决、或不致向更高之英國法庭上訴、蓋四犯業已移交當地天津區法院、且爲</p>
<p>四犯辯護之愛理思律師公館律師瓊斯、今已赴日本也、推事瓊思於判决前、說明對於四犯之天津監禁人、發出傳達狀時之情勢、據稱、已發傳達狀及發出之日期等事、對於渠所得論斷、無關重要、此項論斷、即决不能用保護人身法令狀提該四華籍犯人來按署法庭是、</p>
<p>保護人身法令狀之運用、似常限於英國人民與英國保護下之人、而此决請發令狀者、並非上述兩者之一、申言之、據渠意見、若對傳達書准發保護人身法令狀、則將伸展保護人身法律至從未到達之程度、關於四人引波事</p>
<p>爲時過遲巳屬無能為力、令狀之初旨乃在提被禁者人身至法庭、此舉旣已不可能、則令狀不應發出云、查英按署本月十一日對傳達狀聽訟時、四犯辯護人瓊斯曾辯稱、天津英軍司令旣知英按署推事巳有傳達狀致彼而彼竟將嫌疑犯移交日方偽法院、實屬</p>
<p>蔑視法庭等語、推事瓊思之判决文中、並未討論此事、惟指稱、天津英軍司令應駐津英總領事之請、於六月七日自英租界警務處提出四犯、負責覊禁、嗣復應英總領事之請、於九月五日將四犯交運警務處、故八月三十一日發出傳達狀時、四犯由</p>
<p>英軍司令拘押中、然九月六日傳達狀送達時、四犯巳非英軍司令所覊禁云、昨夜據本埠法律界意見、即使傳達狀及時到達、當巳發現英軍官若因履行英政府之特殊命令、致不從法庭狀、亦不能稱之為蔑視法庭、</p>

<p>本巿各團體委託米號樂公會代辦之洋米平糶、前日因「九一八」停售一天、昨仍繼續辦理、第三區平糶處、（即戈登路玉佛寺）於昨晨八時開始平糶後、購米平民紛至沓來、人數竟達五千人以上、且多爭先恐後、致捕房所派探捕、一時無法維持、秩序遂起紛亂、當有一年的六十餘歲不知姓名之老者、被擠受傷、探捕等見勢不佳、乃即通知暫停平糶、將受傷者救護出外、車送就近之勞工醫院診治、一面勒令購米者排就隊伍、魚貫入內、至九時許、始重行　糶、但仍以人數過湧、秩序欠佳、復暫停糶、再加攔粗大蔴繩、並由探捕嚴密監視、至十一時十五分開糶後、秩序轉好、直至十二時四十五分、巳將洋米二百包售完、下午即宣吿停售、</p>

<p>豆米市場　恢復扞樣</p>
<p>豆米市場營理委員會、鑒於客帮商家買賣、自暫停扦樣後、致同業時生糾紛、現經　　第四十决會議議決、自即　　恢復扦樣、並繕發第八—號公吿云、案據第四十五决　管理委員會議決定、，自即日起公樣處仍恢復扦樣、凡未發樣者、如有糾紛、概不受理、相應錄案公吿週知、即希各客商公鑒、昨日市塲各貨、一律卜跌一元左右、</p>
<p>今日限制　糶一千包</p>
<p>據聞自今日起、五平糶處、現定每處平糶一百包以一千包為限、至第二决平糶、亦在計　中、惟因鑒於此次擁擠情形、秩序欠佳、前日公會會召集各處主任會議、曾提出一意見、實獻恊會、如實行二决平糶、則售票擬請各　　及道選科靠之米號承辦、庶於平糶時、對秩序時間人手俱能有史進一步之成績、此次五平糶處協會方面、均派有一人專司監督、故對經濟收支、除必須動川款項、加佈置紙張　　等小數　、餘均送交協會、各處職員、亦均全盡義務、平糶處職員、均為各米號所抽派、中秋將屆、店務紛繁、故能早日糶畢、於公於私、實屬兩便、但各處職員、鎭日為平民服務、並無絲毫怨哲　反覺於心良慰、現來號業公會、巳將二日平糶之款三萬一千元、彙解銀行、將來自有詳細　目、公諸社會、</p>
<h3>節約運動委員會勸吿　勿囤積商貨居奇　市民應本天良勿攫過分利潤　庶使物價回平共維社會安寗</h3>
<p>本市節的運動委員會、前以外匯緊縮、各業紛紛漲價、而無關外滙之商品、亦竟乘機提高售價、遂使百物聯貴、平民生計、蒙受嚴重威脅、故曾發表文吿、籲請各業迅予自動退止、以免影響社會秩序、乃自</p>
<p>歐戰爆發後、一般商人、又復操縱居奇、甚至業外人亦多以高價購致各項商貨、大量囤積、企圖養價而沽、卒使物價趨於不規則之飛漲、威脅平民生計、為害實匪淺鮮、昨特再發告各界書、切盼迅予遏制、原文云、「自歐戰爆發後、滬巿一般經營洋貨之商人、以為時機巳至、乃即故甚其詞、造作過分讕言、佯謂某貨某物來源即將斷絕、遂將以前廉價所進之貨、</p>
<p>操縱居寄高抬價格、而多數　外之人、亦思乘機圖利、不問某項貨物之存底若干、銷數如何、及其來源之是吾間斷、竟輕信投機商人之播弄、不惜以較高價格、購致各　貨物、大量囤積、影響所及、遂使洋貨價格、趨於不規則之飛漲、如西藥。顏料。洋針·報紙、等項、售價竟</p>
<p>晨高夕漲漫無止境、較之歐戰前、且有漲達四五倍至十餘倍以上者、是共結果、投機商人固以一轉手之勞、而獲數倍之利、但大多數之勞苦羣衆、則生活益感困難、蓋賅項小法之利潤、均係向勞苦羣衆剝削所得也、至一般業外人</p>
<p>囤積商貨之結果、不僅無獲利把握、月適予人以牟利之機、現時經各力調查結果、歐美各國貨品、甚至德國商品、仍可照常由中立國輪運滬、而白報紙一項、則已由挪威輪大批裝運到滬、各貨來源旣無盧斷絕、則售價自不致冉行高漲囤積居奇、或將</p>
<p>反致虧蝕竊為智者所不取、尙望各業商人、共本天良、舊有存貨、幸勿故昂其價、攫取過分利潤、而業外之人、更弗輕予嘗試、購貨囤積、允盼各菜領袖、因勢利導、剴切勸誡、共謀遏止、庶使物價回平、共維社會安寗、則千萬勞苦羣衆、感念大德、豈有涯涘，　誠奉吿、幸希鑒納、上海節約運動委員會敬啟、</p>

<h3>季雲卿　遭阻擊殞明　沿罷歸寓突遭暴徒阻擊　年高氣衰不及救治身死</h3>

<p>交友頗廣　生徒尤種</p>
<p>其屍體當由院方車送騐屍所、經報請法院檢騐後、再行車往世界殯儀館收殮、同時因季交游頗廣、而門下生徒、亦頗可觀、故在出事後前往探視者甚衆、至於被殺緣由、尙在偵查中、惟據一般傳說、最近外界對季之謠言甚熾、且有某種企圖、</p>
<p>遣有妻子　女孫六人</p>
<p>季之家屬方面、遺有妻女子孫等六人、子名少卿、年三十餘歲、己娶媳李氏、生有二子（即季之孫）、名水福。全福、季女巳適董姓、季妻陸氏、亦卽人稱金寳師娘者是也、在數年前、上海租界警務處開辦女探員之時、該金寳師娘卽首先應募、列為第一名女探、因此在警務範國中人、咸皆知之、</p>
<p>經營商業　並開戲院</p>
<p>至於季之生前事　、除經營商業外、並在無錫開設戲院、其無錫住宅、已遭焚燬、在一年前季曾患重瘋症、經牛年餘、悉心訪治、始吿痊可、並卽因此而成習慣、每日必須沐浴、有暇時恒與其生徒作雀戰消遣、至於宴會應酬、如非相當知好、每多謝絕、</p>

<h3>金融　謠言復盛　現金退入四千元關　午後證券幫突來實貨出籠　造成三八九〇元之最低價　一天交易仍暢約三千餘兩</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤增盤市況、始則堅穩、徘徊於四千一百元內外、午後暴落、傾瀉至三千九百元關內、當日局勢仍紊亂如麻、高低差額、距二百五十元、初開因外滙緊軟、致金價亦隨之向榮、晨開即高達四千一百二十元、開後外滙突然轉鬆、且和平空氣雖重慶方面力予吾認、但市上仍有傳說、加之銀樓帮競相吐售、遂即暴跌至四千〇三十元、後因港幫吸胃殊强、兼證券幫亦來吸烟、再以其時外滙略轉軟化、遂起漲風、立昂達四千一百四十元高峯、旋以外滙復趨鬆動、業者如證券帮等均轉買為賣、回落至四千〇五十元、午刻因某錢兌業重來拉提、遂以四千〇八十元收盤、午後初時極穩、一度曾漲至四千一百十元、少頃突聞外匯鬆勢頗厲、並以上項空氣、傳說更盛、形勢頓虛、賣戶遂接踵而來、尤以證劵帮突來實貨出籠一千數百兩、加之買戶均具戒心、大都趙趄不前、雖某金號尙有納胃、但終難以相敵、價竟盤小至三千八百九十元低價、結果以三千九百元收盤、較上日續跌百元、前途在和平空氣未消滅之前、恐不易回漲、當日交易仍暢、約三千餘兩、銀樓節金終則軋小十五元、海關金等仍呆定如故、</p>
<p>烚赤又暴落百元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）初開、因外匯帶軟、故人心尙佳、開市做高一百二十元、若較上日最後價則僅抬起數十元、某金號進錢兌業二十兩、價為四千一百二十元、開後散戶賣意甚濃、銀樓帮亦來塞出、故即吿步軟、迨至跌近四千一百元關口時、外滙忽轉鬆動、故賣風更健、立降七十元、錢兌業售予同業及某銀號共五十兩、為四千〇三十元、時某錢兌業納胃轉强、證券帮亦來吸收、遂又上漲七十元、金號進錢兌業二十兩、為四千一百元、後聞外匯復稍回軟、加之證劵帮與金號等續來吸購、遂再上升四十元、證劵帮復吐予金號一十兩、為四千一百四十元、此後現金號與銀樓帮頻來塞出、且外滙父趨鬆勢、不支下退、不久即暴落九十元、現金號售予錢兌業二十兩、為四千〇五十元、午刻某錢兌業買意復萌、又來拉提、遂即抬起四十元、某錢兌業進金號十兩、為四千〇九十元、繼而銀樓帮賣予另一錢兌業三十兩、為四千〇八十元作午收價、午後初開穩定、首由錢兌業售予銀樓帮十兩、仍為四千〇八十元、時某錢兌業頗有納胃、步高三十元、證券一帮進銀樓帮十兩、為四千一百十元、後市上和平空氣忽父濃厚、同時外匯亦報鬆動、加之證券都多頭大舉了結、兼銀樓帮亦跟踪競塞、致市勢傾向下瀉、立暴跌七十元、銀樓帮賣予錢兌業二十兩、及某銀號四十兩、均為四千〇四十元、時錢兌業互做十兩、為四千〇六十元、此後因外滙鬆動頗銳、又傾跌一百十元、錢兌業賣予銀樓帮十兩、為三千九百五十元、其時某金號忽來吸收、遂即拉高三十元、某金號進錢兌業及證券帮共六十兩、為三千九百八十元、後某金號止進觀望、價又下瀉、立破入三千九百元關內、證券帮與錢兌業售予某錢兌　共四十兩、為三千八百九十元、入後某金號復興買風、力吸百餘兩、故跌風頓戢、某金號進證券帮三十兩、及錢兌業十兩、為三千九百元作晚收價、結果比上日暴落百元、聞收後抬高至三千九百二三十元、全天二百五十元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮成交、</p>
<p>飾金掛小十五元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸四百十元、迨至十時二十分掛高五元、逾刻許後回落五元、下午三時掛小五元、三時二十分又跌五元、四時十五分再小五元、結果軋小十五元、計大同行改懸三百九十五元、新同行為三百九十三元、收進的减小二十元光景、</p>
<h3>華商轉賣外滙愈切　美匯掛牌雖又改縮　暗市過程續見猛鬆</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市況因受海外匯兌、美對英竟又暴跌六分之影響、故本巿匯豐美匯掛牌、突縮一二五、創現五元半之空前最緊價、荷呂日亦縮、他如英匯等則均平定、內盤晨開、亦美較英為緊、英金計四辦士〇三一二五、美匯為六元三七五、開後因上日和平空氣、市上尙靴消散、故一般買戶、大都咸具戒心、加之華商與港電互相拋寒不巳、雖日行正金與沙遜會來吸收英金、但因外行吃胃不佳、故頭寸終屬供過於求、午刻已硬達英金四辦士一八七五、及美匯六元六八七五、午後因上項空氣傳說更熾、故一般浮多、莫不爭先恐後、紛來了結、如華行與華商紗花帮等、競相猛塞、允以英金為甚、加之外行仍吃量不湧、故形勢極形鬆懈、英金最賤為四辦士三七五、美匯則亦隨之硬達六元九二七五、結果以四辦士三四三七五及六元八七五收盤、合英美匯兌為三元七角九分八厘半强、本月期貨趨勢仍與現貨相若、全天交易尙旺、</p>
<p>沙遜日商尙有吸收</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條近期漲四二七五、遠期長半辨士、紐的銀價升半分、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對美對滬對法均平、美對英縮六分、對滬大一角、對法小二分、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金叫辦士〇三一二五、美匯六元三七五、較之前收、英緊〇四六八七五、美軟一五六二五、美較英為緊、乃美英匯兌降低之故、開後因上日和平空氣仍熾、加之港電與華商等均競未塞出、並外行吃胃不佳、故為狀回硬、計華商與港電相繼賣予外行現貨英金由四辦士〇九三七五長至一五六二五、兼現貨美匯由六元四六八七五、硬達五六二五、迨匯豐掛牌揭曉、英平美縮一二五、及白銀平衡稅揭曉大二分七五、此後日行正金與西商沙遜突來吸收英金、致巿勢略轉軟化、計日行及沙遜結進匯豐有利現貨英金四辦士一二五及〇九三七五、同時外行美匯賣價亦回至六元半、嗣後華商復起賣風、兼港電與港帮等亦有塞日、是以潛勢重趨硬化、計港電與華商又相繼塞予華行與有利及某美行等現貨英金四辦士一五六二五及一八七五、並現貨美匯六元六一五及六八七五、延至午收銀行現貨賣價、英金四辦士一八七五、美匯六五六二五、比晨開英鬆一五六二五、美硬二八一二五、</p>
<p>美金逼近七元關口</p>
<p>後市因和平空氣、更形濃厚、一般賣出頭寸、愈見湧旺、如華行·華僑·上海及華商紗花帮等莫不爭先塞出、以英金居多、故鬆勢英較美允厲、計華行與華商等吐予外行現貨英金由四辦士二八一二五硬至三七五、並售予大通某行小數現貨美匯由六元六八七五、長至九三七五、延至晚收、銀行現貨賣價、英金四辦士三四三七五、美匯六元八七五、本月份英金四辦士三一二五、美匯六元八一二五、結果比上日、現期英均鬆二六五六二五、美俱硬三四三七五、</p>
<p>香港申滙降十五元</p>
<p>香港十九電、今日滙市晨開平穩、對英對日不動、美匯現貨緊三七五、為二十三元八一二五、申滙現貨降十元、為三百六十元、十一時正穩定、美匯鬆〇六二五、為二十三元八七五、申匯現貨續降五元、為三百五十五元、十一時三十分及下午二時三十分開盤、仍無榮辱、</p>
<p>天津英美滙價略長</p>
<p>天津十九日電、今日滙市晨開見硬、英滙現貨鬆〇六二五、為三便士半、美滙現貨長一二五、為五元半、申匯降一元、為一百十八元、「聯鈔」暗盤賤四元、為八十五元、</p>
<h3>外幣漲後突降</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、始因外匯銀行緊扳售價、故美金票晨初昂達十五元三角半、旋因和平空氣仍囂塵上、近午乃退至十四元九角、午後此說更盛、匯市大鬆、金價暴落、外幣當不能例外、賣氣因而驟旺、公會掛牌價退為十四元五角、比上日下落三角半、英金票卒吿暴落四元二角、英美金鎊一致猛降三元、香港票跌一角四分、法郞票小二分、坎拿大票降一角、日金票落一分二厘、朝鮮票降一分五厘、餘尙平穩、</p>
<h3>况入百元內</h3>
<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率、在跌益烈、每貼千元之率、巳敲破入一百元內、上午初為一百十元左右、近午竟破入百元內、退至八十五元、下午始見回上十元、最後九十五元、比上日再在跌十七元半、乃購買外匯與現金者日少、現鈔充斥所致、錢業公會拆息、早午兩市仍開二角未更云、</p>
<h3>英美金價續漲未已</h3>
<p>十八日倫敦電、銀巿有人補空、少供給、市况堅俏、收盤後、轉平、進者照掛牌價稍有成交、做開大條銀、近期長四三七五、遠期升半辦士、紐的銀電、美現貨漲半分、又孟買銀電、印銀市况平靜、現期俱未更動、成交單共計一百五十張、</p>
<h3>同業滙劃　末次支取法幣</h3>
<p>本市銀錢兩同業公會、前為調劑同業賣金、商得中中交三行同意、將各銀行及錢莊六月底止給存銀行凖備會與錢業準備康之匯劃存款本息、全數按九五折合法幣、分十二個星期平均支取、自七月四日每星期二為支取之期、巳詳本報、昨日（十九日）為第十二决（末次）支取之期、各行莊均分別開轉帳聲請書、將國幣零戶餘額悉數支淸、有轉入國幣往來戶者、亦有掉三行專用支票、領取現鈔者、共計約一百八十餘萬元、從此同業匯劃折合法幣之事結束、查自七月四日起、市面巳增加現鈔籌碼二千餘萬元、匯劃貼水因此日少、昨日已跌至百元以內矣、</p>
<h3>紗花　浮多不安　紗市下降亦速　雙馬天女各跌四十元</h3>
<p>連漲一週之紗市、昨則驟然下瀉、蓋以盛傳中日和平空氣濃厚、加之客銷不暢，人心允虛、浮多更現不安之狀、有一部份照市斬結、市盤乃迅速下降、二十支雙馬現貨跌進八百元關口、天女跌破七百元關口、隨後實力充足之戶、復來塌便宜貨而收進、重形回上、雙馬復達八百元邊上、就目前大勢測之、暫時或有一度盤旋、容待實需發展、再現新姿態也、</p>
<p>現紗晨開因上日人心良好、二十支變馬現貨價為八百三十元勿動、雙地球為七百八十元、反高十元、少頃市塲喊賣聲復起、情况頓見紊亂之象、市盤步步下墜、雙馬一跌至七百七十元、棧單跌至七百二十元、旋以價低新多頭又來活動、市價徐徐回升、查半日間成交統計九百包、行情二十支雙馬跌三十七元、牧羊跌五元、天女跌四十元、雙地球跌二十五元、今日有棉紗九十六件運厦門、七十五件運香港、五十件運廣州灣、九十件運北海、三十件運海口、茲將各帮口買去之額列左、</p>
<p>香港　一六〇　同行六五五</p>
<p>內地　八五　統計九〇〇</p>
<h3>新花到貨日旺　市價回跌四五元　海外棉市亦疲弱</h3>
<p>現棉交易、尙　不弱、但巿價略見回挫、跌四五元之譜、良以海外棉巿疲弱、印棉預測跌十餘羅比、本埠新棉正在上市之際、通州花來源無阻、而日見踴躍、以致人心軟化、賣價鬆懈、至於廠方鑒於到貨擁擠、辦意轉澹、蘇北來源、到通州花五千包左右、又北沙來四百八十件、茲將現棉售開之盤列左、</p>
<p>另訊、滬埠外棉交易、昨日市上各方謠言紛起、因之各同業深恐市况將有絕大之變動、故均擬暫抱觀望態度、交易因而忽轉靜寂、各方深信、此乃暫時性者、一俟此項謠言之證實無稽、則棉價將可恢復往日之舊觀也、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐的棉巿、殊為靜寂、因時値秋收、南方棉農、在紐約棉市、每逢高價、即猛烈套賣、日來在市套賣頗烈、故棉市殊難振作、加以海外棉商在市拋賣、價格昨日又跌十餘磅音、印度連同預測、竟猛跌十三羅比、埃及跌二十餘磅音、利物浦跌二十餘磅者、</p>
<h3>證券　內債漲風驟盛　丙種衝出四十四元　外股市況穩中帶堅</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日照常買賣、人氣忽轉堅昂、前日停巿期內、各個人之交易、暗中巳趨漲甚勁、昨日開市、上午平平、下午漲風突盛、市塲謠言蠭起、雖未經正式證實、但已足以引起一般人之興趣、所謂和平空氣、甚囂塵上、更以各種貨品之跌價、外滙及金子之鬆軟、人心於以興奮、昨日經過、開盤與日昨暗中所做行市相仿、買賣亦覺閑散、多數又為觀望、市價上落極微、午後開做、謠言驟起、種種傳說、雖屬捕風捉影、但均無法證實、同時因外滙續長、金子棉紗等均見大跌、又似有共相當因果、故塲內頓見熱鬧、散戶雖仍有賣出、但吃戶依然踴躍、如茂泰·永康·聯益及二十五號等陸續買進、巿價上騰、逐步轉勁、丙種衝出四十四元關、收市後更見四十五元五六角之行市、人氣興奮、於此可見、收盤價與上週六比較已漲起一元四五角、成交總數、的計一百五六十萬元之譜、茲列簡表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、仍無起色、祇華商電氣股成交五十股、價為五元角七分半、</p>
<p>又衆業公所報吿昨股市平穩帶堅、雖開盤時價格稍軟、但入後趨勢冉冉向上、會德豐股一度被抬至三十六元高價、一般人似想像此番良好股息之宣佈、巳屬在望、收盤時三十四元七角半有買戶、賣方需索三十五元、</p>
<p>倫敦十八日電、今日遠東英商各公司股票掛牌行巿、銀行股又見降落、麥加利銀行股、跌二先令六便士、價為六鎊一先令六便士、滙豐銀行股各跌一鎊、英倫註冊股跌至六十九鎊、香港註冊股降至七十一鎊、古拉客林傍橡皮股仍站原盤、為十七先令六便土、其餘仍未開出、</p>
<p>倫敦十八日電、今日中國外債掛牌行市、仍聞英法克利斯浦及善後等三種行情平穩不動、其餘均無報吿、</p>
<h3>糧食　粳米不動　客秈提升二三角</h3>
<p>杜米　河下無到、車輪包子、來崑興等區各貨六千餘包、到貨雖屬不稀、但人心未肯輕脫、故本街銷塲雖屬平常、而各貨價仍站原盤、且若江北新尖以市貨無多、高者加起半元、計無錫粳仍為四十元、高三十七八元、中三十六元、蘇同崑粳三十六元三十五元、河下早晚稻三十二元至三十一元半、崑山新粳三十三元、顓橋三十二元、周浦新粳三十一元、崑山·盛澤·嘉興·嘉善·新羊尖二十七元半至二十七元、團尖二十六元、陳蕪尖决廿五元、新尖二十六元、次之二十五元、江北新尖二十六元半至二十六元、變元三十六元至三十五元、香港糯團粒三十五元半至三十五元、長粒三十四元、統計全市成交、仍為五六千包而已、</p>
<p>客秈　昨日晨巿亦居軟弱、旋因江北一帶到頭已見减少、而進戶則以價碼低宜、需要不衰、且內地鄉莊與米店等均有揀高吸收、市乃逐步好轉、午市售價已經提二三角、下午貨方售意更堅、昨日成交有四千多包、江北秈高二十六元五六角、蕪秈二十六元左右、中次則二十五六元不等、</p>
<h3>麵粉暗鬆　小麥存底日厚</h3>
<p>麵粉市況、明定暗鬆、二號粉廠盤雖站七元二角原盤、而回籠貨巳逐漸鬆疲、良以金市猛跌、米價銳落、更受日粉傾銷影響、人心莫不餒弱、南北客銷、亦鮮開展、均思擇巧而取、故市面無形鬆軟、回籠貨較前又鬆角許、兵船脾價七元一角六七分、砲車牌祗七元一角左右、成交數祗一萬餘包、本街零批交易、亦祗六七千包、洋粉近有南洋帮注意、及國外來源有阻、售價仍須七元七八角、二十日出口麵粉、三萬七千五百包運天津、六千一百三十包運厦門、一千七百五十包運香港、</p>
<p>麥市趨勢、亦鮮振作、連日各地來源絡繹、而實銷平淡、存積日見充厚、執貨者心意動搖、均願隨市求脫、而購者趁此抑價、致巿面逐漸抑落、統市廠囤雙方均擯持乏交、僅日粉廠暗中略購進四五車、價較前見降一二角、</p>
<h3>雜糧　新芝蔴續到　售盤漲二三元</h3>

<h3>介紹商務職工平糶法</h3>
<p>— （程浩）</p>
<p>公司撥三萬特別公積作基金　平糶法則六面可供各界參考</p>
<p>近來「孤島」物價高漲，尤以米價漲到四十元左右一石，更使薪給階級感受生活困難，因而各業職工多向僱主要求津貼救濟。僱主們能够體卹職工生活，實行發給津貼的也不在少。不過，有的發給米貼，有的增薪幾成，數目目數元至數十元，大小旣不一律，辦法允多得失。</p>
<p>上月商務職工曾向館方提出律貼的要求，歷經波折，最近才由館方定出平糶食米與職工的辦法，自九月份起實行，茲特介紹如下：</p>
<p>（一）公司就「乙種特別公積」金（原作公益之用）中撥款三萬元，作為在滬各同人平糶食米之基金。此項基金於虧耗至不敷平糶適量之米時，由公司考慮加撥之。</p>
<p>（二）在滬各同人月薪在一百元以下奢，得享受平糶之利益。</p>
<p>（三）享受平糶利益者，每月以八十市斤為最高額，按其需要之程度分級如下：（甲）學生女工（寡居之女工，有翁姑兒女待養者，得比照男職工待遇）及男職工本身一人在滬者，每月各得購平糶米二十巿斤（合一斗二升半）。（乙）男職工之妻室兒女或受供養之直系尊親，有一人在滬同居者，該職工每月得購平糶米四十巿　；有二人在滬同居者，得購五十市斤；有三人在滬同居者，得購六十市斤；有四人在滬同居者，得購七十市斤；有五人在滬同居者（兒女或受供養之直系尊親，如在二人以上者，仍以二人論），得購八十市斤（合五斗）。</p>
<p>（四）平糶之價，於米價在四十元以內時，按每石十五元之價售與同人。若米價超過四十元時，則以超過之數與十五元之和，作為售與同人之價。例如米價每石在四十一元時，售與同人之價，應按每石十六元計算。米價回跌至十五元以下時，，平糶辦法即行取消。</p>
<p>（五）米價以每月一日至十日二號粳米市價平均數為標凖，但平均數超過四十元時，仍照四十元計算。</p>
<p>（六）公司就第三條所定各級同人可購米量中，計算公司補助之米量，再依第五條標準合算補助之米價，註明於「平糶券」，每月十五日分發，由同人持向公司指定之米號，按此合算之米價購米。米號收得此券後，得備函向公司收款。</p>
<p>這個平糶辦法，雖沒有完全解除我們職工生活的困難，但尙不失為一個比較公平合理的米貼法則，所以我特據實介紹，以備各業當局作為改善職工生活的參考。</p>
<h3>女性的呼聲</h3>
<p>— 沈師光</p>
<p>是九月十號那天，我看見報祇上登着「郵政管理局代內地招考初級郵務員」的通吿，當時我眞歡樂得跳了起來，因為據向來的規則，郵務員是招收女性的。現在自己一切也正都合格，上內地又是向來的志願，這不是很好的機會嗎？於是就在第二天一淸早，從最西的兆豐花園跑到最北的北四川路郵政總局，懷着一團熱望，充滿着希望之光踏上了二樓的營業部，在第十號的窗檻上我停下了：</p>
<p>『先生，請給我一份報名單。』</p>
<p>『哈！總局剛剛來電說，此次不收女職員。』</p>
<p>這一道禁令，使我抱着一顆熱望的心而來，却懷着一顆粉碎了的心回去。我不知那時我該憤怒抑或是悲哀，為了經濟，我不能升大學；在上海找職業，又很困難，到內地去，也得慢慢的等着機會，如今自以為是最好的機會來了，但是誰知道這唯一的希望也被粉碎無遺，這傷心眞是到了不可忍耐的程度！</p>
<p>聽說這决其所以不收女性的原因，是因為「女子體質薄弱，不堪忍受遠走之痛苦，」道種體卹是有些迂腐之見，生在二十世紀的女孩子，還是弱不禁風的嗎？自己敢去報名，自己還不知道自己的體格嗎？一般摩登小姐們當然不願上內地去受苦，但是像我們自願到內地去服務的女性，自信我的身體不會比男子差多少的！假使把西北的女子和上海的公子哥兒們一比，我想後者眞要自慚其醜吧？我願大家不要儘存着舊有的心理，時代的巨輪是在前進着，人類也在進化中，女子也並不是永遠永遠是不能出遠地的閨閣小姐呀！我願當局能三思而行之。</p>
<p>在這二十世紀時代，男女平等，女子經濟獨立高唱入雲的當兒，到處還都在拒絕着女子就業，不知何意？巳婚女子旣被摒棄，未婚女子又遭厄運，我眞不知女子是否永遠永遠的該死了。</p>
<p>常有男子譏笑女子不能經濟獨立，但照現在的情形看來，是我們自願不自立呢，還是社會環境所使然。</p>
<p>最後我要吿大家的是，此决陸續往內地去求學的，男女人數幾乎是相等，請不要以為女子部是不能忍受遠走的痛苦。</p>
<p>末了，我願女同胞們大家拿出力量來努力地去爭取我們的權利，我們的事業！</p>
<h3>雨過天靑</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十六回　謀興醫學造士成庠　思擴村治託兒有所</p>
<p>此外關於衛生的不完全，觸目皆是，也筆難盡述。老章醫師到各處問歷了一番，她只揀荒僻的地方去看，覺得有些地方，人民眞是苦惱。但現在巳經漸漸的想在改良了，若在從前，眞和地獄裏一般。不過改良衛生一切，也須要相當的人材。中國在戰前，糊裏糊塗，不知培養人材。又因為人材不能與事業相配合，常有很好的人材，不能為世所用。甚而至於許多人，為了生活問題，所用非所學，不得不改業的。現在以正常的事業，配合正當的人材，便覺得缺乏了。老章醫師因想到要使內地的衛生事業發達，非趕緊培養衛生人材不可。她從前也像美國以前孤立派的宗旨一樣，只守好了自巳的崗位，其餘的事一槪不問。她自己的崗位是什麼呢？就是辦好這個婦孺醫院。當時那個婦孺醫院規模很小，連育嬰院也沒有設立。就是派朱愛人到美國去留學的常兒，也還是守着她的崗位。要把產科兒科這兩科，辦得好好地的，出發點還是在醫學上的。可是後來迴個育嬰院，辦得非常順手，馳譽中外。叉有那個一胎三兒，珍聞佳話，鼓起了人家的興趣。捐款自動的由人家寄來，那巳超越了僅僅產兒兩科醫學的範圍，使辦事的人愈加增高了興味了。可是因為這裹聲譽鵲起，便有許多人，向老章醫師徵求人材。不但是他們的敎會中，在內地宜敎，興辦慈善事業，設立醫院的，向她徵求。連政府所設立的衛生委員會，也向她微取人材了。因此老章醫師一向所站的崗位，叉擴大了一些，她也想多培養些人材。自從她到中國內地去游歷了一周後，更覺得各處的缺乏人材，需要人村，非多造就些人材不可了。如何的造就人材呢？就是要設立醫學校。以中國地方如許之大，人民如許之多，設立一個醫學校，正如杯水車薪，無濟於事。然而多一個醫學校，總是多造就一些人材，造就些人材出來，以應各方的徵求，也是好的。因為醫學校往往要一個實習的地方，而此地究竟有個婦孺醫院，可以供實習。老章醫師自從在中國內地游歷回來，蓄了這個願心，巳經一年多了。（一八三）</p>
<h3>某洋行特寫</h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>上海洋貨市塲的縮影</p>
<p>是星期六的上午，剛巧八點半鐘的時候，某洋行的買辦間里，巳非常的鬧熱了。混雜的談話聲，和濃烈的香烟味，充滿了這幽靜的買辦間。</p>
<p>噹噹……的鐘聲，衝破了這緊張的空氣，不客氣地一連敲了九下。</p>
<p>「怎樣買辦先生到現在還未見駕臨？昨天他答應賣給我三十件牛皮紙，賣價講定每磅大洋六角，但是照昨夜的買價，巳漲到七角一磅，假使他老人家等一會兒還不來，恐怕他要推翻前議了！』獨坐在西角落里的王先生，似乎等得有些失望的樣子。</p>
<p>『可不是嗎？前天上午，我向他買五百令白報紙，價講定每令十七元五角，到下午送鈔票來出貨的時候，市價已漲到十九元一令了。因此險些兒把這交易打碎，後來幸有趙先生肯從中說情，結果以每令十八元的代價，成了道筆交易。現在的熱路貨眞難收，你搶我奪，並且市上的賣價，早晚不同，竟在轉身的一刹間，已有變價之虞，豈能相隔這長長的一夜，恐那言定的價錢，已成廢話了吧！』李先生緊接着王先生的談話。</p>
<p>『聽說外國定價亦漲二成，並且暫時的二三個月里，還不能交貨，所以昨天公會裏的議價，亦因此而混亂極了。小陸前日收進的五件輕磅牛皮紙，在昨天下午脫手，巳賺了三百多元。祇說毛先生一人，在一月前所囤積的五萬多元的白報紙，照昨日的市價計算一下，已足有七萬多元的意外收獲，旁人看了，那一個不眼紅呢？所以我也來盡量的收一下，祗要有機會，今年下半年的一切開消，都可照在這「排頭」上了！』阿吳很興奮持說着。</p>
<p>『買辦先生來了！』祗這麼輕輕的一句，已打斷了他們的談話，頃刻間靜寂得聲息全無了。</p>
<p>一位胖胖的買辦先生，纔跨進了買辦間的門口，巳被許多的買客包圍的水洩不通了。繼續的就是議價，看樣，買貨，做那賣買應有的手續。</p>
<p>雖賣價不停的上漲，但是仍有許多買客會盡量的收進，祗要有現貨出售，對於賣價稍爲貴些，買主們決沒有絲毫的怨意。因爲他們都擁有一個神秘的希望，如何靠這現貨的身上，去賺一筆厚利！</p>
<p>因此如斗室般的一間寫字間里，祗忙着打棧單，開發票，收鈔票，解銀行，結匯票，忙碌得打成了一片。</p>
<p>時計不停地向前在推進，買辦間里的買客，亦一批一批的在掉換。有的大量囤積，有的小數收買。這三小時中的混亂情形，也是上海洋貨市塲的一個縮影。</p>

<h3>演戲豈可忽略劇本乎</h3>
<p>— 張古愚</p>
<p>戲劇，社會敎育也，敎授學生，要審定讀本，勸化民衆，豈可忽略劇本乎？有淸中葉，民氣剛强，人心古樸直率，一切皆以正直是尙，偏見為卑，看戲皆從正面着想，初不如今日民氣之頹唐，人心之險惡奸詐，捨正路而勿由也。所以虹霓關，戰宛城在早年算是勸吿婦人不可動妄念之戲，今人皆不注意其結果，而反留心於思春，勸善變成誨淫矣。打龍袍，遊六殿，古人以為功能勵孝，今人目為提倡迷信焉。看到九更天中馬義，風波亭中岳飛，年老人家多敬其忠，同時會想到侯花嘴張邦昌之可惡，可恨，今人非特不想到侯張之毒奸，而反會說馬是忍，目岳為愚。七星廟在表面看來，似乎平淡無奇，其實暗地裏是在警告輕年男女不可在外間行苟合之故事，說楊家後來無結果，就是七星廟中行過苟且之事之報應，今日年輕男女十九多抱及時行樂觀念，『將來』二字，似乎可以不必去談</p>
<p>狀元譜一面寫陳芝之可愛，一面寫朱倉之可惡，從中在吿訴吾人，古人窮到做討飯的化子了，還不忘祖宗，拿高登是述奸臣之子魚肉鄉民，結果終為人誅，幷可使今人知道古人肯仗義救危，上天台是記君王沉迷女色而誤大事，潞安州寫武將死於忠烈，反被敵敬。牧羊卷因何呌蓆蓬認妻，而寫蓆蓬認母，因朱母之不死，其媳趙氏之功也。不　認母而改寫認妻，所以勵後人耳。白綾記是警吿學子不可涉足花叢，挑滑車乃暗示輕年切忌操之過急，如此等等，不一而足。惜今之演戲者只求合乎看戲者之歡迎，看戲者但得演戲者予他好看與好聽，演戲看戲，如此而巳，誰管其責任？誰探其意義？人心世風，今昔靡同，所演之戲，豈可一本前例乎？</p>
<p>演戲須擇劇本，是目前最重要問題，誨淫誨盜之劇，固應根本禁絕，平淡無奇以及不合潮流之戲，亦宜加以取締，總之毫上所演皆屬有意識有寄託而適合於潮流與環境之本，演者一樣演出，看者無形默化，則唱戲非無為，看戲纔有益。</p>
<h3>菊事偶憶（下）</h3>
<p>— 肖傖</p>
<p>民十之前、舊都中有女伶賀舜琴者，先後曾與李桂芬福芝芳雙蘭英等同塲演唱，當時舜琴之魔力頗盛，舜琴初係都中著名淫妓，姿首絕麗，束妝登塲，豐姿允佳，竟體之艷，全在雙眸，常者無不為之神迷，其人性喜結交武生，歷與楊小樓，沈華軒，俞振廷，九陣風，周瑞安，劉硯芳諸倫，發生關係，小樓與硯芳誼屬翁壻，而舜琴得而兼之，亦梨園界之趣聞也。舜琴平時艷妝入各戲園，遇武生出塲時，則注目凝視，蕩意盡在眉宇間，雖千人矚目，殊弗以為意也，曲終則人忽爾不見。每遇新到武生，彼必爭先一諸，醉翁之意，實不在酒也。某年蓋呌天北上奏藝，舜琴見其身手矯健，悅之，百計追求，卒入彀中，舜琴為賃小屋於櫻桃斜街，與之雙宿雙飛者的數月，形影不離，儼若伉儷，會蓋父與北妓陳樂淸相識，陳固名妓，舜琴與爭，致吿決裂，舜琴乃獵周瑞安以慰寂寥，又楊小樓曾以舜琴故，與硯芳發生醋波，經內行中人調解，乃由翁婿兩人會靴—會靴者，都中指兩入同挾妓，而在其妝閣，相互晤面之謂也。兩人之私嫌始釋。更有一事，允屬可笑，舜琴與某武生（或言康喜壽，或言沈華軒）同游故都新世界，兩人忽在電話室中作穢褻之行，事為游客告發，警察奔至，將兩人捉將官裏去，罰媛並拘留若干日，始寢其事，其豔聞秘史，類多若此。愚在民八秋曾在中和園與胡平齋君聽其起解玉堂春諸曲，胡幾排日聽舜琴歌，其意亦在獵舜琴欲得而甘心者，其人唱工身段兩俱不惡，色更動人，惟白口表情，不如內行，後有粵人某官僚愛之，日定座捧塲，戲畢則共乘汽車而去，路人成為目逆而送，捧塲者，皆在呼呌好，醜態畢露，民十之後，其人遂絕跡歌塲。</p>

<h3>The German and Soviet Armies Meet in Greater Poland; Britain and France Declare Their Determination to Uphold Their Original Intentions and Lodge a Joint Protest with the Soviet Government; Soviet Troops Mistakenly Enter Romania and Immediately Withdraw</h3>
<p>London - The Polish government yesterday informed Britain that the Soviet Union had invaded Poland, describing the action as a "flagrant act of aggression." The note was submitted by Polish Ambassador to Britain, Count Raczynski, to British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax. The Polish Ambassador then requested Britain to fulfill its obligations to Poland in accordance with the Anglo-Polish Mutual Assistance Treaty. (September 19th, Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>London - Well-informed sources have suggested that regarding the entry of Soviet troops into Poland, the British and French governments will jointly lodge a protest with the Soviet government today, but do not intend to take any further action for the time being. (September 19th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>London - Responsible sources here have recently issued a statement condemning the Soviet invasion of Poland and reaffirming Britain's determination. They state that while Poland is unable to withstand the pressure of the German army, the Soviet Union has launched an attack, and the British government does not consider the reasons given to be justifiable. Although the full implications of this action are not yet apparent, the British government wishes to take this opportunity to declare that, with the full support of the nation, it will fulfill its obligations to Poland and continue the war with all its strength to achieve its goals. This determination will not be changed by current events. (September 19th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Paris - There is now no doubt about the understanding reached between Germany and the Soviet Union. Although National Socialism and Communism are theoretically opposed, they are now combined to achieve their imperialistic goals, disregarding various treaties and the principles of non-aggression to promote Pan-Germanism and Pan-Slavism. However, France has not yet received a formal report, only a notification from the Soviet Union stating its willingness to maintain neutrality. Therefore, the Soviet Union's intentions must be determined after further actions by that country. Although Germany is trying to exaggerate that the cooperation between Germany and the Soviet Union is enough to make Western European countries declare their surrender, France considers it not worth responding to. In short, Italy originally had the possibility of mediating after Poland's defeat, but now Germany will likely speak for itself, forcing Britain and France to accept a National Socialist peace, or else fight a group stretching from the Rhine in the west to Japan in the east. However, no matter what country's assistance Germany receives, Britain and France will not stop fighting unless they destroy National Socialism. Germany's use of intimidation only shows its growing anxiety. (September 18th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Bucharest, Romania - According to reliable sources, the Soviet troops entering Poland number between twenty-five and thirty divisions, and some have already reached major locations along the Polish-Romanian border. (September 18th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Zurich, Switzerland - A German wireless station recently issued a message confirming that Soviet troops occupied Vilnius in northern Poland at 5:00 PM today. The city is close to the Lithuanian border. (September 18th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Belgrade, Yugoslavia - News has recently been received from the capital of Hungary that in southern Poland, Soviet troops have reached the vicinity of the Hungarian border and exchanged greetings with the Hungarian border guards across the border. (September 18th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Bucharest, Romania - Soviet troops who arrived at the border between Poland and Romania entered Romanian territory between Guti and Vicnai-Suceava. After being warned by the Romanian Defense Forces Commander, a Soviet officer apologized and withdrew back into Polish territory. (September 18th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Moscow - A local radio station broadcast today that after the German and Soviet armies met at Brest-Litovsk, 180 miles east of Warsaw, they are expected to make contact in the south soon, but it will take several days to meet in the central region. According to foreign military experts, at least 500,000 to 1 million Soviet troops are participating in the invasion of Poland. Soviet troops entered Vilnius yesterday without resistance. This is the first time Soviet troops have occupied an important city. The meeting between German and Soviet troops at Brest-Litovsk was very friendly, with officers congratulating each other. When Soviet and German pilots encountered each other in Polish airspace, they waved happily to each other. The two countries will also establish a buffer Polish state. (September 19th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Germany and the Soviet Union Begin Propaganda, Threatening the Baltic States, Claiming a Certain Country is Hiding Polish Submarines; Lithuanian Foreign Minister Meets with Soviet Envoy</h3>
<p>Moscow - The Leningrad report claims, according to reliable sources, that Polish submarines are currently hiding in the ports of several countries in the Baltic Sea and receiving secret assistance from personnel of certain governments. News has also been received that in addition to Polish submarines, submarines from other countries are also hidden in the aforementioned ports. On September 18th, a Polish submarine, originally interned in the port of Tallinn, Estonia, suddenly escaped without a trace. It is believed that this was the result of the Estonian authorities' connivance and assistance. The Soviet Baltic Fleet Command has now taken measures to prevent harassment by submarines hiding in the Baltic Sea. (September 18th, TASS dispatch)</p>
<p>Tallinn, Estonia - Estonian Navy Commander Mir and Navy Chief of Staff Linnaste were dismissed from their posts today by the president. This is the first measure taken after investigating the escape of the Polish submarine "Orzel" from this port, and was recommended by the Estonian Commander-in-Chief. (September 18th, Reuter dispatch)</p>
<p>Kaunas, Lithuania - Soviet Ambassador to Lithuania, Pozdnyakov, had a secret half-hour meeting with the Lithuanian Foreign Minister this morning. The content is kept confidential. (September 19th, Reuter dispatch)</p>
<h3>Polish President's Message to the People: Continue to Fight for National Restoration</h3>
<p>Paris - After fleeing to Romania with government officials, Polish President Mościcki issued a message to the Polish people yesterday, which was released by the Polish Embassy in France. It stated: "It is well known that German forces are far superior to our own. While our troops are fighting against Germany with utmost courage, our east unexpectedly took advantage of our crisis and invaded our territory, disregarding existing treaties and moral principles. Historically, our country has been attacked on two fronts, which has no precedent, and now we are facing a double invasion. What more can be said? But we have established a treaty of alliance with Britain and France, and we will continue to fight for justice and civilization, to overcome the strong and the barbaric. We also believe that we will survive to the end. During this difficult period of struggle, it is necessary to maintain the structure of the Polish Republic. Therefore, although I am deeply saddened, I have decided to move the Presidential Palace and other important institutions to a safe area to continue exercising full sovereignty and oversee the interests of the Republic. From now on, I will share the burden with the people of how to maintain national glory." (September 18th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Dutch East Indies Strengthens Defense</h3>
<p>The Hague - The report prepared by the Dutch East Indies Naval Defense Committee was released today. The report advocates building fast cruiser-battleships of 25,000 to 30,000 tons, equipped with 280 mm guns, and expanding the Surabaya naval base. (September 19th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Map of the German-Soviet Conspiracy to Partition Poland</p>
<p>London - The Daily Telegraph's diplomatic correspondent, citing Soviet sources, says that the Soviet Union's advance into Poland is aimed at occupying the entire eastern part of Poland, up to the so-called Curzon Line. In other words, from Grodno, passing through Bialystok, Brest-Litovsk, and Przemyśl to the Carpathian Mountains. According to this "Curzon Line," which is the eastern border of the new Polish state advocated by Britain in 1920, if the Soviet Union has its way in southern Poland, the entire territory of Ukraine will be included in the Soviet Union's borders. Judging from the Soviet Union's statements, Moscow has no intention of defining a common German-Soviet border. The Soviet Union has always wanted to establish a Polish buffer state. However, it is still difficult to determine whether the Soviet Union's actions have obtained Germany's consent based on the agreement recently reached in Moscow. One more thing that can be inferred is that the Soviet Union does not want to see Germany strengthen its power on the shores of the Black Sea. The visit of Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu to Moscow is mainly focused on cooperation in Black Sea defense. Generally speaking, the Soviet Union seems to be adopting a protective stance in the southeast and west, and does not want to expand its borders except for neighboring lands threatened by a third strong country like Germany.

<h3>Balkan Situation: Turkish Ambassador Meets with French Foreign Minister; Yugoslavia Sends Envoy to the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Paris - Turkish Ambassador Suat met with Foreign Minister Triber this morning. After a long conversation, well-informed sources were very satisfied. It is said that "The Turkish government's position has not changed due to changes in the international situation, as can be seen from this. The negotiations between Britain, France, and Turkey regarding the conclusion of a mutual assistance agreement are still progressing smoothly. The visit of Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu to Moscow is exploratory in nature and has no other purpose. The information collected during this trip will not only benefit Turkey but will also be welcomed by Britain and France." In addition, sources have reported that the Turkish government may prohibit British and French warships from passing through the Dardanelles and Bosporus straits so that the Soviet Union can supply Germany with various goods via the Danube River without being intercepted by British and French warships.

<p>Belgrade, Yugoslavia - It is widely rumored here that the government has sent a special envoy to Moscow with a secret mission to inquire. Sources predict that Yugoslavia's policy towards Russia will change course. Semi-official sources have neither acknowledged nor confirmed these rumors. (September 19th, Reuter dispatch)</p>
<p>Belgrade, Yugoslavia - Prince Regent Paul issued an order this morning granting the government full power to amend existing laws or promulgate new laws when necessary, until a new parliament is formed. (Note: The parliament was dissolved on August 27th of this year, and when elections will be held has not yet been decided.) However, all measures taken by the government under this full power shall be submitted to the parliament for ratification in the future. (September 19th, Reuter dispatch)</p>
<h3>Hitler Arrives in Danzig and Delivers a Speech, Denouncing the Treaty of Versailles</h3>
<p>Danzig - Hitler arrived at the Polish border in Danzig today. Danzig National Socialist Party leader Forster greeted him there and expressed gratitude to Hitler on behalf of the people of Danzig. Hitler replied that he was very happy to meet them in this city again after it returned to Germany. The two then shook hands. After Forster addressed the people, Hitler began his speech. He said that those who witness this great day of liberation are not only the people of Danzig but also the people of the whole world. Not only do the people of Danzig feel happy, but all Germans are as happy. He himself also feels the greatness of this moment. He is now trampling for the first time on land that has been inhabited by Germans for five or six hundred years. The World War was the most meaningless of all wars, sacrificing this city and this land. In that war, everyone failed, and no one won, so everyone had a kind of confidence that this kind of fate would never be repeated in the future. Germany's participation in the World War had no war objectives but hoped that the subsequent peace would enable Germany to recover and eliminate all suffering. Unexpectedly, the result was not free negotiations but the Treaty of Versailles imposed on the German people. The warmongers at that time not only did not solve this military problem but created countless new problems. The oppressed Germany was unwilling to submit for a long time and will rise again to solve the newly created problems. The Treaty of Versailles ignored Germany as a country with 82 million people, all of whom want to live and will always live. Hitler also said that in another fifty years, Poland will return to barbarism. Poland has never been a democratic country, and its people are oppressed by tyrannical authorities.

<h3>Japanese Newspapers Have Different Views</h3>
<p>Tokyo - The Nichinichi Shimbun newspaper group said that it is doubtful how long the current German-Soviet treaty can be maintained. Therefore, the partition of Poland may not strengthen the friendly relations between Germany and the Soviet Union. In fact, Ukraine will eventually become a point of contention between the two countries. Hochi Shimbun, which has always advocated the establishment of a military alliance with the Axis powers, took the opportunity to advocate strengthening relations between Japan, Germany, and Italy to create a new order unfavorable to Britain. Miyako Shimbun said that with the conclusion of the Japanese-Soviet armistice agreement, the Soviet Union concentrated its forces in Europe, and Britain and France withdrew from the Far East stage. Thus, the policy of encircling Japan was broken. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the Japanese government to rise and complete the new order in East Asia. Chugai Shogyo Shimpo advised the government to adjust its entire relationship with the Soviet Union, saying that doing so would help resolve the China war. (September 19th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Secret Agreement Between Germany and the Soviet Union to Partition Poland</h3>
<p>London - Diplomatic officials here now believe that an agreement has been reached between Germany and the Soviet Union to divide spheres of influence within Poland. However, it is still difficult to determine whether this agreement was reached when the two sides signed the non-aggression treaty on August 24th or after the fact. The Soviet government was deeply concerned that Germany would disregard the agreement and seize the entire Poland, so it suddenly sent troops to Poland to implement the partition method stated in the agreement. Germany has probably recognized the Soviet Union's right to occupy the lands inhabited by the Ukrainian and White Russian ethnic groups, and once Poland disintegrates, it will further establish a small, independent Polish state as a buffer state between Germany and the Soviet Union. This Polish state should have a population of 18 million and be controlled by Germany and the Soviet Union. However, before it is officially established, Polish territory not occupied by the Soviet Union should be temporarily occupied by Germany. (September 18th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Tallinn, Estonia - According to reliable sources, Germany and the Soviet Union have concluded a secret agreement, the main points of which are as follows: (1) Define the new border after the two sides partition Poland; (2) The lands inhabited by the Ukrainian and White Russian ethnic groups within Poland may be occupied by the Soviet Union; (3) Establish a small Polish state as one of the socialist republics belonging to the Soviet Union, that is, as a Soviet "protectorate". Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's speech yesterday that "the Polish people are in dire straits, and the Soviet government is prepared to rescue them" probably refers to this. As for the intention of Germany and the Soviet Union to regard the small Polish state as a Soviet protectorate, it is to create a situation that would make it impossible for Western European countries to continue using force unless they declare war on the Soviet Union. Regarding this, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop is reportedly convinced that in this situation, Britain and France would never reject the armistice proposal to be put forward by Führer Hitler. This proposal will be presented in a form of “fait accompli.” If Britain and France reject it, then Führer Hitler would launch an attack on France without hesitation, perhaps by passing through the Netherlands or simultaneously feigning an attack through some other neutral country with lightning speed. Given that the staff of most German factories in the Netherlands have been recalled to Berlin by the German military authorities and told that the government urgently needs people who understand the Dutch language, it can be seen that the above rumors may not be completely groundless. (September 18th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Moscow - The Soviet and German governments have jointly issued the following communiqué: "In order to prevent various unfounded rumors regarding the actions of the Soviet and German armies in Poland, the governments of the Soviet Union and Germany hereby declare that the purpose of the armies of the two countries does not violate the interests of the Soviet Union and Germany or conflict with the spirit and letter of the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Treaty. On the contrary, the task of the armies of each country is to restore peace and order in Poland, which has been disrupted by the collapse of that country, and to assist the Polish people in rebuilding the conditions for their national existence."

<h3>Gandhi Supports Britain's Stance</h3>
<p>London - Former Governor of the Northwest Frontier Province of India, Lord Hailey, gave a broadcast speech this evening, stating that India's cooperation with Britain to cope with the European situation is of great significance. The Indian National Congress has never expressed agreement with the goals of German policy. Gandhi, who has always hated war, now believes that Britain's claims are extremely just and that India should provide unconditional assistance. It is still remembered that during the last European war, India voluntarily recruited as many as 1.5 million soldiers, of whom 1.25 million were sent overseas to fight, and supplied Britain with 3.5 million tons of grain. Its loyalty is self-evident. (Right: Gandhi and Nehru) (September 18th, Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>England and France Versus the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Poland's resistance against Germany is as fragile as withered wood. Every battle results in defeat, lasting less than twenty days. The capital is already heavily besieged, and three-quarters of the territory has fallen. England and France are raising their arms to provide assistance. Although significant forces have entered German territory, they remain stalled outside the Siegfried Line. This is how the overall war situation between England, France, and Poland against Germany is viewed. It is merely the beginning, with the ultimate decisive point lying on Germany's western border. However, the war situation on the Polish side has already reached a point where its end is in sight. Then, the Soviet Union forcibly enters, achieving overwhelming victories without bloodshed. As a result, eastern Poland falls entirely under Soviet control, exacerbating Poland's dire situation. Nevertheless, Poland still possesses its government, land, people, army, and political institutions—everything a nation should have. According to military experts, the German Siegfried Line is by no means impregnable. However, it will take at least three months for the Allied forces to complete their preparations for an offensive against the Siegfried Line and launch a major destructive campaign. Three months is not a very long time, but unfortunately, Poland's situation is precarious and cannot last indefinitely. According to yesterday's news, the Polish army has already exhibited signs of complete collapse. The Polish government, from the president to high-ranking officials, and the commanders, from the commander-in-chief to high-ranking generals, have successively fled to the neutral neighboring country of Romania. The land has changed color, and the people do not know where to turn. Therefore, there is no need to talk about three or several months. Even if the Allied forces could flatten the Siegfried Line tomorrow and march grandly towards Berlin, with eastern Poland controlled by the Soviet Union and western Poland becoming Germany's rear end, it would be difficult for Poland to remain a nation. If we were to speak of regrouping and restoring its scale, is that not a distant prospect? It is not a distant prospect, only if the German Nazi regime collapses. If Germany does not collapse, how can it compromise and leave a "crack" for Poland to exist?</p>
<p>Everything stated above is not a curse on Poland. Although Poland is a nation that cannot understand fairness and does not respect justice, and is even willing to align itself with puppets, we still deeply sympathize with its current plight. Everything stated above is also not an acknowledgment of the reality created by force. However, we believe that those who seek to correct reality must, in addition to recognizing reality and encouraging a shared future, as expressed in "Polish President Mościcki's tearful plea to the nation," seek practical and effective paths. But where does that path lie? If England and France persist in their intentions and have the strength to support them, then that is naturally a path to correct reality and a path to Poland's restoration. This goes without saying. If England and France are willing but lack the strength, and another country helps them, that is also a path, which also goes without saying. However, the overall situation has greatly changed. England and France's intentions are what we must consistently uphold. Until the time of this reporter's commentary, we have not heard of any decisions made by England and France. Although England and France claim that the Soviet Union's dispatch of troops into Poland was "not unexpected," they do not have a clear plan on how to deal with it. The hesitation, doubts, and distress of the past few days cannot be concealed. We sincerely do not know what England and France will decide. However, we believe that the principle for any nation in establishing and implementing its policies should be to vigorously pursue its national policy without looking back and not lightly change or reverse its decisions. Only when the overall situation greatly changes is it necessary to reconsider the national policy and then decide whether to change or uphold it. Are England and France currently in the process of deliberation?</p>
<p>What England and France are considering involves many aspects, the resulting consequences are vastly different, and the impact is enormous. Indeed, England and France's declaration of war on Germany has complex arguments, among which fulfilling obligations and assisting Poland is a major argument. Although Poland's current state is in fact on the verge of ceasing to be a nation, it theoretically still exists. To secure the endangered and restore the overthrown are all within the scope of assistance, meaning England and France's obligations still exist. Where there is an obligation, only aggression should be questioned. Why then distinguish between Germany or the Soviet Union? Moreover, if the Soviet Union is left unquestioned, not only will it be impossible to justify oneself in terms of obligations, but if Poland, in some way, appears to have been destroyed by the Soviet Union, what meaning would England and France's continued war against Germany have? Therefore, if England and France do not change their national policy, there is no other path but to declare war on the Soviet Union. As of last night, England and France had not declared war on the Soviet Union. Furthermore, according to dispatches from London, England and France only intend to jointly protest to the Soviet Union and will not take any further action for the time being. Although protesting without declaring war can be said to be a change in national policy, it is also possible to declare war after the protest. However, in the interval between when they should have declared war and when they have not, it can also be said that the national policy is temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>Whether England and France's national policy is suspended or changed, we should not hastily accuse them of being timid or untrustworthy. Why? If England and France declare war on the Soviet Union, it would not only drive the Soviet Union and Germany into closer collusion, as discussed yesterday, but also raise significant questions about how to achieve military victory and whether economic blockade would still be possible. Moreover, it is not just this. England and France's war with Germany allows the war situation to remain relatively simple for a period of time. If England and France and the Soviet Union and Germany become two belligerent groups, then the outcome would be difficult to foresee, and the impact of the outcome would extend to the interests, safety, survival, and demise of all other countries in Europe. Therefore, all countries, whether for their current relationships or for the profound impact in the future, would absolutely be unable to continue maintaining their neutrality. Following England and France's declaration of war on the Soviet Union, all countries would immediately participate in the war one after another. Countries such as Southeast European countries, Baltic countries, and Balkan countries, as well as Italy, Spain, and Portugal, would not be able to stay out of it. With all countries participating in the war, how would the distinction between friends and enemies be made? If they are invited as friends, would their interests not conflict, and what would the conditions be? If they are established as enemies, would the gains not compensate for the losses, and what would the military strategy be? All of these are things that England and France must consider, and they are sufficient to cause England and France to fundamentally change or temporarily suspend their national policy.</p>
<p>War is an extremely cruel and painful behavior that transcends reason. Only when survival is at stake and one is forced to act, as with China, is war sacred. However, even in the midst of continuous war, when enemy forces penetrate deep, when the people are united, and after suffering severe devastation, even while deeply believing that victory is assured, we still hope that Japan will abandon its aggression, withdraw its troops, and make peace. Moreover, if England and France have not yet had major contact with German forces, have not decided to declare war on the Soviet Union, and there is still unlimited potential for expansion to other countries in Europe and even to other continents, at this time, if Germany and the Soviet Union could both restrain their emotions, extend their reason, and mutually renounce some of their ideas and desires, and mutually allow for the free survival of all nations, thus avoiding the most cruel and painful consequences of prolonged war, it is certainly a course of action that reason should strive for in a timely manner. England and France are temporarily suspending their national policy; should Germany and the Soviet Union not also understand the meaning of ultimate misfortune and turn back quickly?</p>
<h3>German Army and Air Force Launch Major Siege; Warsaw's Soldiers and Civilians Refuse to Surrender; Key Polish Military and Political Figures Seek Refuge in Romania; Soldiers Retreat into Neutral Countries and Are Disarmed; Refugees, Supporting the Old and Carrying the Young, Follow One Another on the Road</h3>
<p>Paris: The mayor of Warsaw still stated in a broadcast today, without hesitation, that Warsaw would not surrender to German forces. (September 19, Associated Press)</p>
<p>Budapest: According to Polish Colonel Lipinski, who broadcast from Warsaw yesterday, although the Soviet Union has occupied Polish territory, the Soviet Union declared neutrality, so there was indeed no resistance to the Chinese army's advance. He also said that there is fierce fighting around Warsaw, with German infantry using aircraft and heavy artillery as offensive weapons. Although the German side is fiercely bombing Warsaw, the residents of Warsaw are still defending Warsaw with an indomitable spirit. (September 19, Associated Press)</p>
<p>Berlin: German Commander Godon issued a final communiqué stating that the German army's right wing advanced in southern Poland and occupied Drohobych today. Therefore, the most important city in the Polish oil field has fallen into the hands of the German army. No Warsaw envoy has been dispatched yet, so the fighting near Warsaw, which was temporarily suspended, is now continuing. (September 18, Haitong Telegraph)</p>
<p>Lviv: It is learned that the Polish army won a major victory near the city of Grodek (west of Lviv) and annihilated a German motorized unit and a battalion of Austrian infantry. Two German generals were killed in action, and one colonel was captured. (September 18, Havas Telegraph)</p>
<p>Berlin: According to a military expert's report received by the Haitong News Agency, "The German army's plan to encircle the Polish army from the north and south has been completed, opening up a line from East Prussia to the Polish-Hungarian border. Therefore, most of Poland's territory and three-quarters of its people have fallen into the hands of the German army. The area east of this line is mostly inhabited by Ukrainians, Belarusians, and Lithuanians, and has always been a turbulent area. It is pointed out here that the place where the Polish army was stationed two weeks ago was only 150 kilometers away from Berlin. Now, it is 500 kilometers away. Statistics show that the German army has occupied 250,000 square kilometers of land in half a month. Among them, there are some isolated Polish remnants, such as southwest of Vistula, north of Warsaw, near Modlin, and east of Lviv. All have Polish remnants. However, the traffic of these troops has been cut off, and they know nothing about the major political changes in recent days. They are only stubbornly resisting, so clearing them out is only a matter of time." (September 19, Haitong News Agency)</p>
<p>Cernăuți, Romania: Polish Army Commander-in-Chief General Smigly-Rydz, Prime Minister General Składkowski, and General Sosnkowski (former Chief of Staff of former Minister of Military Affairs Piłsudski) have succeeded General Smigly-Rydz in commanding the Polish army. (September 18, Havas)</p>
<p>Rome: Polish Army Commander-in-Chief General Smigly-Rydz has taken refuge in Romania and is now residing in the southern city of Craiova. Polish President Mościcki is temporarily residing in the northern Romanian city of Piatra Neamț. Other members of the Polish government are residing in the central city of Slănic. The Romanian government will allow certain members of the Polish government to reside in the country in a private capacity, but this has not yet been confirmed. (September 18, Havas)</p>
<p>Kaunas, Lithuania: The wife of Polish national hero, the late Minister of Military Affairs General Piłsudski, recently fled into Lithuanian territory with her two daughters. Many Polish dignitaries have also entered the country one after another. (September 18, Havas)</p>
<p>Rome: Yesterday, 350 Polish aircraft arrived in Cernăuți, Romania. Including those that had arrived in Romania earlier, the total has reached 500. The reason why a large number of Polish aircraft flew into Romania is to prevent them from being obtained by the German side. The Polish pilots have been ordered to be detained by the Romanian authorities, and the Polish aircraft have also been temporarily confiscated. Among them, the pilots of four bombers were injured and are now being treated in hospitals. Two aircraft of unknown nationality were scouting on the Romanian border. One of them dropped two bombs on the Romanian village of Cristești, killing six civilians and setting fire to several houses. Another foreign aircraft dropped bombs on Cotlenchin, killing three people and destroying one house. At the same time, Soviet aircraft also bombed the Renadin station in Polish territory outside the border. (September 19, Associated Press)</p>
<p>Rome: A total of 650 Polish aircraft have flown into Romanian territory and have been detained. 550 of them are detained in various places in the north, and 100 are damaged and unusable. There are also 200 tanks and a large amount of military equipment in the capital of Romania, which are also being kept by Romania. According to the Polish consulate in Cernăuți, an estimated 30,000 Polish soldiers and civilians sought refuge in Romania today alone. (September 18, Havas)</p>
<p>London: It is reported that a large number of Polish soldiers and civilians are now crossing into the borders of Latvia and Hungary. At the same time, 60 Polish aircraft landed in the Latvian town of Daugavpils, near the border of Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia. Many of them were damaged as a result of aerial warfare. All Polish soldiers who crossed into Latvia and Hungary have now been disarmed and detained. It is reported that the Hungarian government is willing to take care of the civilians who seek refuge in the country. (September 19, Reuters)</p>

<h3>British Artillery Reinforces French Army; Artillery War Unfolds on Western Front; Villagers on German Border Continue to Evacuate; Troops Transfer Westward in Preparation for Major Battle</h3>
<p>Paris: Authoritative military sources announced that as the Allied and German forces prepare for a major battle on the Western Front, British artillery arrived at the front line yesterday to reinforce the French army. The major battle on the Western Front will include attacks on the Maginot Line and the Siegfried Line. The silence on the front line was broken by the actions of patrols from both sides in the "no man's land." The two sides exchanged artillery fire to prevent enemy action. At this time, the German army continued to evacuate the people from the villages of Saar, Vosges, Trier, and Aachen. (September 19, Associated Press)</p>
<p>Berlin: Apart from artillery fire, the fighting on the Western Front only involved small teams of outposts operating in the area of Saarlouis. The enemy troops were mostly engaged in digging trenches in various places. There were no air battles in the past two days. (September 19, Haitong Telegraph)</p>
<p>Paris: The General Headquarters has just released its 31st war report stating, "Last night, the enemy troops suddenly launched a counterattack in the eastern part of the Saar region, which was immediately repelled by our troops." Semi-official sources commented that the General Headquarters did not attach much importance to the enemy's counterattack for three reasons: (1) it was very easy for our troops to repel it; (2) this kind of action by the enemy troops was nothing more than a small test of their skills and had no major effect at all; (3) although the positions occupied by our troops in recent days have been constantly bombarded by the enemy, they have been quickly consolidated. In addition, there has been much exaggeration about the fighting on the Western Front. In fact, although the positions occupied by our troops since the start of the war are very extensive, they have not yet taken decisive action. (September 19, Havas Telegraph)</p>
<p>Paris: The Western Front has been quieter in the past 24 hours, with only occasional rifle, machine gun, and artillery fire. It is reported that the German side is now transferring reinforcements and aircraft from the Polish front to strengthen its line and is also evacuating civilians from many villages and destroying their houses. According to the opinion of military observers, the purpose of the German troop evacuation is to allow the German artillery defending the Siegfried Line to exert its power. At present, the shells fired from the German line are constantly exploding in front of the advancing troops. The French side now claims that the German artillery east of Wissembourg in Alsace-Lorraine is quite active and is counterattacking in various places, but it has gradually become quiet. The French army has made considerable progress in the past 15 days, and the German army has also made several decisive counterattacks. It is expected that both sides are now rushing to make the necessary preparations. The latest French war report states that artillery activity is active at all points on the front, especially in the Saarlouis-facing border area. (September 19, Reuters)</p>
<h3>New Italian Appointment; Promoting Bilateral Relations; Will Surely Make Contributions</h3>
<p>Rome: The Italian government recently appointed former Director-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Bastianini, as the ambassador to England, succeeding Grandi. (September 19, Haitong Telegraph)</p>
<p>London: After the Italian government appointed Vice-Minister Bastianini as the ambassador to England, well-informed sources here said that this move has special significance under the current circumstances. Since the Italian government could have allowed the affairs of the embassy in England to be handled by an acting official without rushing to appoint a new ambassador, and Bastianini has made many contributions to promoting British-Italian relations in the past few months, this decision to send him to England is indeed the best sign of Italy's attitude. (September 18, Havas Telegraph)</p>
<p>Rome: According to news here today, Italy has decided to maintain neutrality as much as possible until it cannot remain neutral. It is also reported that Japan will continue to maintain a neutral attitude towards the European war. Many newspapers here believe that the Soviet-Japanese armistice agreement has opened the door to Soviet-Japanese cooperation. (September 19, Associated Press)</p>
<p>Rome: Italian political figures recently commented on the joint military action by Germany and the Soviet Union in Poland, saying, "From now on, the order in Eastern Europe will be reorganized based on a new foundation. German newspapers commented on the joint official statement of Germany and the Soviet Union, saying that Germany and the Soviet Union, regardless of the threats from Western countries, jointly used troops against Poland, and their purpose was to determine Poland's fate. There is no doubt about this. Now that the Soviet Union has sent troops to Poland, it will have a decisive influence on the attitude of Southeast European countries. The significance of Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoglu's visit to Moscow can be seen from this. As for whether the Soviet Union and Turkey will take effective measures to prevent foreign forces from invading the Black Sea so that the war will not expand to the eastern Mediterranean, this is a question that we are paying attention to. In addition, Yugoslavia's sudden expression of willingness to adjust relations with the Soviet Union has aroused the attention of people here." (September 19, Haitong Telegraph)</p>
<h3>Czech People; Deepening Hatred of Germany</h3>
<p>Danzig: Today, news received here from France stated that there is a trend of terror in Bohemia, Moravia, and Slovakia. It is reported that a mutiny occurred at the former Czech Skoda armory, and the German secret police captured hundreds of mutineers. The families of those arrested have received warnings not to mourn or mention the execution of those arrested. It is now believed that someone in Brno started an uprising but was suppressed. It is reported that several people were executed. When the Slovak authorities questioned the German secret police, they replied that they had to take all kinds of precautions to prevent actions that were unfavorable to the German army. It is reported that the execution seems to be mostly aimed at the Slovaks, because they advocate cooperation with the Czechs, and this doctrine is obviously becoming increasingly resentful of the Germans. (September 19, Reuters)</p>

<p>Budapest: Admiral Regent Horthy has issued an order to send a minister to Tokyo, Japan, and appointed the former consul to Washington, D.C., Mr. Ghika, as the first minister. (September 19, Havas Telegraph)</p>
<p>Rome: New Hungarian Minister to Japan, Ghika, left here yesterday on the Italian postal ship "Vojanyia" to take up his post in Tokyo. He will pass through New York on the way. (September 19, Haitong Telegraph)</p>
<h3>European Situation Resembles a Play; England and France Only Have Clown Roles; Cold Sarcasm from U.S. Senator Borah</h3>
<p>Washington: Republican Senator Borah told reporters yesterday that the European war was a bit too "comical." The authorities in England and France were only playing "clown" roles and were not making efforts to fight on the Western Front. However, since the Soviet and German armies are still busy fighting on the Eastern Front, according to my personal observation, England and France can take the opportunity to take action. After the Soviet Union joined the war of aggression, the Allied forces may lose the friendship of Turkey. However, if England and France believe that the Soviet Union and Germany are "too powerful to be swallowed," then peace may not be impossible to achieve. (September 19, Associated Press)</p>

<p>Eve of U.S. Congressional Special Session</p>
<h3>White House Calls Leaders of All Factions; To Review European Situation; Whether Neutrality Act Applies to Soviet Union; Depends on Attitude of England and France</h3>
<p>Washington: President Roosevelt, in order to thoroughly review the European situation, recently convened leaders of the Democratic and Republican parties for a meeting at the White House on the 20th of this month, asking them to cooperate with the government in the hope that Congress would be able to quickly discuss the amendment to the Neutrality Act when it convenes on the 21st. Those summoned to attend included, on the Republican side, the party's 1936 election candidate Landon and Chicago Daily News publisher Colonel Knox, and on the Democratic side, Senate Majority Leader Barkley, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman, and House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Bloom. The government side included Vice President Garner and Secretary of State Hull. It is generally believed that at this time of serious international crisis, Landon and Knox can cooperate with the President as much as possible, as Landon has repeatedly supported the government in the past, and the Chicago Daily News is known for advocating the abolition of the arms embargo. Political figures here said that the "obstructive tactics" adopted by the opposition have had a bad impression domestically. At this time, American public opinion is somewhat disappointed with the chaotic situation in Europe. Although it still has confidence in the government, it has been shaken somewhat by isolationist propaganda. The President's convening of key figures from both parties is intended to prepare before Congress reconvenes so that the current Neutrality Act can be amended smoothly according to the government's wishes. (September 18, Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>Washington: President's Secretary O'Lary said that the President's invitation to various key figures to participate in the group meeting has no partisan significance. Those participating in tomorrow's group meeting will all be "national leaders." (September 19, Associated Press)</p>
<p>According to a statement by an official of the State Department, unless England and France declare war on the Soviet Union, the United States will not impose the Neutrality Act's arms embargo on the Soviet Union.

<h3>Eastern Newspaper Writes Article: Warning America, If Attitude Towards Japan Does Not Change, The Pacific Will Become a Battlefield</h3>
<p>Tokyo - The "Hochi Shimbun," a mouthpiece of the Japanese Army's hardline faction, today issued a warning to the United States, declaring that if the United States does not "change its attitude toward Japan," the Pacific Ocean will become a "battlefield." The newspaper stated that for the past two years, Japan has adopted a "cautious attitude" toward improving Japan-U.S. relations. The newspaper admitted that Japan adopted this policy because the United States is the only major power capable of taking free military action in the Far East, and the United States has supplied Japan with a large amount of essential military supplies for its war against China. The newspaper also said that Japan is trying to avoid antagonizing the United States, because the United States has "no political interest in obstructing the construction of a new order in East Asia." The newspaper continued, "But on the American side, the country is trapped by the concept that 'Japan is an aggressor in the Far East,' and the United States misinterprets all of Japan's actions in the Far East." The newspaper mentioned that during the recent negotiations between the United Kingdom and Japan in Tokyo, the United States "announced the abolition of the 1911 Japan-U.S. Treaty of Commerce and Navigation in order to put pressure on the United Kingdom and Japan." Since the outbreak of the European war, "the United Kingdom has withdrawn from the Far East, while the United States pretends to be the protector of the old order in East Asia." It is reported that the United States is planning other economic measures to oppose Japan, such as banning the export of military supplies to Japan and stopping the purchase of gold. The newspaper also criticized the U.S. fleet for being stationed in the Pacific. The newspaper concluded, "Japan and the United States both do not want war, but Japan may be forced to safeguard its right to survival, which is expected. If the United States insists on a policy of suppressing Japan, and Japan still never changes its doctrine of building a new order in East Asia, then there is a considerable possibility of war between the two countries." The "Asahi Shimbun" and "Yomiuri Shimbun" claimed that the United States intends to succeed the United Kingdom as the "watchdog" of the Far East, and the evidence is obvious. The two newspapers warned the United States against "unnecessary provocations against Japan." "Miyako Shimbun," on the other hand, commented in a different tone, "We hope to restore the Japan-U.S. Treaty of Commerce and Navigation as soon as possible, and to conclude a non-aggression pact with the United States."

<p>Yokohama - Suma, former Counselor of the Japanese Embassy in the United States, passed through Yokohama today en route to Changchun to take up his new position at the Japanese Embassy there. According to his words to visiting journalists, the peace and security of the world at present really depend on Japan and the United States. The United States is the leader of the Western Hemisphere, and Japan is the leader of the Far East, so the two countries should work together at this time to seek peace throughout the world. However, the United States has recently been extremely concerned about the situation in Europe. The American people are different from those of 1914, and they all have a real anti-German sentiment. Moreover, because the feelings of Americans are easily impulsive, he believes that it is only a matter of time before the United States joins the European war. As for the relationship between Japan and the United States, he believes that there is no need for a temporary solution, and there will eventually be a day when it will improve. We often point to the United States as being anti-Japanese, but this matter cannot be blamed solely on the United States. If Japan and its people can have a better understanding of Americans, this unfriendly feeling will surely disappear quickly. Therefore, he advocates that Japan should have a deeper understanding of the United States, Suma concluded, that although the U.S. abrogation of the 1911 U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation is already a thing of the past, Japan came to regard this matter indeed like a bolt from the blue.

<h3>The English Aircraft Carrier Courageous was Sunk by a German Submarine: More Than Half of the Crew of Over a Thousand is Still Missing. English and French Navies Cooperate to Deal with German Submarine Warfare</h3>
<p>London - Regarding the British aircraft carrier "Courageous," which was sunk by a German submarine yesterday, the authorities now claim that a total of 681 people have been rescued, including 70 officers. The entire ship carried 1,260 people, so 571 people are still missing. (Reuters dispatch from the 19th)</p>
<p>London - After the British aircraft carrier "Courageous" was sunk by a German submarine yesterday, 400 of the rescued crew members have been sent to British ports by destroyers. How many were rescued by merchant ships is still unknown, and the captain, Jones, is also missing. According to a crew member, he last saw the captain standing on the bridge giving the order to abandon ship. Another survivor said that the order to abandon ship was issued five minutes after being hit by a torpedo, and the ship sank within 30 minutes. However, because the ship capsized very quickly, some lifeboats could not be used. Two loud noises were heard in one second, followed by several smaller explosions. When the ship was sinking, some of the crew members were below deck, and most jumped into the sea. Those who could not swim grabbed wooden planks to hold on to. In addition to the destroyers rescuing people, a British merchant ship quickly arrived, presumably rescuing many people, and a Dutch merchant ship and an American cargo ship also came to help. One survivor floated at sea for 75 minutes. According to his account, the crew members acted lively and happily, and sang generously while swimming. Another survivor said that when the "Courageous" was hit, the lights went out, but the crew members were orderly. While they were swimming and waiting to be rescued, they were still joking with each other. (Reuters dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>Paris - Semi-official sources have recently explained the close cooperation between the British and French navies in dealing with German submarine warfare, stating that as of now, French warships have almost sunk four or five German submarines. This is not an exaggeration. The fact that such results can be achieved in a short period of time is even better than the allied warships in 1918 chasing German submarines with all their might. As for the way in which British and French warships are tasked with destroying submarines, a reserve fleet was formed before the start of the war, ordering them to pursue submarines in wartime, so that the active fleet could concentrate its forces on dealing with the enemy fleet. This reserve fleet is mostly composed of light and fast ships and a large number of armed fishing boats. The torpedoes fired by German submarines are aimed at larger warships, and all pass under the hulls of these ships without hitting them. On the contrary, these armed fishing boats are all equipped with cannons of considerable weight, and there are many submarine-launched cannons, which can be called the nemesis of submarines. (Havas dispatch from the 19th)</p>

<h3>American Steel Tycoon Charles M. Schwab Dies: His Success Secret Was Hard Work from Humble Origins</h3>
<p>New York - Charles M. Schwab, a famous American millionaire known as the "Steel King," died here today at the age of seventy-seven. Schwab came from humble beginnings. He started out as a seller of cigars at a dime apiece and then worked as a clerk in a grocery store in Braddock, Pennsylvania. One day, Jones, the supervisor of the Edgar Thomson Steel Works established by the Carnegie Brothers Company, came to the store to buy cigars. Schwab had the idea of ​​finding another job, so he asked Jones if he could find a job in the steel factory. Jones said he could, but he had to start by driving piles and dragging chains as an engineer. If you can withstand this labor, you can earn one dollar a day. Schwab immediately replied that he could endure this labor, so he was able to enter the factory. Schwab was unwilling to be a pile driver for long. Every night in his spare time, he studied engineering mathematics diligently and spared no effort. Before long, Jones knew that this young man had potential, so he was appointed assistant engineer in less than six months. Later, within three years, he was promoted to chief engineer and assistant manager of the factory, with a monthly salary of 250 yuan. At that time, he was only twenty-one years old. Schwab's ability to manage affairs won the hearts of the workers. In 1889, after Jones died, Carnegie appointed Schwab to the supervisory position left by Jones. In 1897, he was promoted to general manager of the Carnegie Steel Company. One day, the New York Chamber of Commerce hosted a banquet for Schwab. Schwab took the opportunity to suggest the organization of the United States Steel Corporation, saying that if the American steel industry could abandon competition and cooperate, its future would be limitless. In 1901, Wall Street financiers sponsored his proposal, so the United States Steel Corporation was established, and Schwab was appointed general manager. At that time, he was thirty-nine years old. In 1903, Schwab resigned and formed the Bethlehem Steel Corporation himself, and became rich as a result. Today, he is still the chairman of the company. During the last European war, the steel products manufactured by Bethlehem Steel Corporation for the British government were worth 150,000,000 yuan. It also manufactured wartime supplies for Russia, worth 75,000,000 yuan. Germany tried to stop the company's military supplies from being supplied to the Allied countries and offered Schwab 100,000,000 yuan as a bribe not to sell military supplies to the United Kingdom. Schwab refused to accept it. When the United States joined the war, Schwab again built warships, merchant ships, and shells for the U.S. government, working day and night. The scope of its business has expanded day by day. Schwab was optimistic throughout his life and often said that this was the secret to his success. Schwab also said that more money cannot bring happiness. One of the greatest happinesses in life is looking forward to the future, always having something that is just beyond what you will achieve, and always having something that you cannot get. If a person has reached the point where they can buy everything with just writing a check, then their happiness will gradually disappear. I have gained many pleasures in my life that are not caused by money. (Reuters dispatch from the 19th)</p>

Huang Yanpei, Zhang Junli, and Zhou Lan will serve as conveners. It is reported that the association will hold its first meeting in the near future.</p>
<p>Closing Address</p>
<p>The fourth session of the National Political Council commenced on the anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Guangzhou Uprising, convening in Chongqing. One hundred and forty-one councilors participated, deliberating for ten days. They listened to the government's policy report, reviewed the implementation of past resolutions, deeply appreciated the government's strong leadership in the war of resistance, and admired the arduous efforts of the soldiers and people. The session was held after the outbreak of the European war. The council members believed that active efforts were needed in political, military, economic, and diplomatic aspects to adapt and respond. In addition to careful review and detailed recommendations on the government's policy report, a total of eighty-three proposals were submitted by the councilors, with eighty-two resolutions passed. Among them, important resolutions included the request to the government to convene the National Assembly on a fixed date to implement constitutionalism, the resolution regarding the puppet organizations, the Sichuan-Kang development plan, the organization of a delegation to慰勞慰勞 soldiers at the front, and resolutions concerning stabilizing finance, relieving disasters, and comforting the people. With the deliberations completed, the session is adjourned in accordance with regulations. The closing ceremony coincides with the eighth anniversary of the September 18th Incident. Reflecting on the past, we are even more determined to strive forward. Based on the consensus of all members, adhering to consistent national policies, and carefully considering current needs, we hereby present several points on the closing day, declared by the Speaker of the Council on behalf of all members to China and abroad: (1) From the beginning of our country's war of resistance against Japan, we have had an absolutely necessary war objective. The battle will not cease until the objective is achieved. The declaration of the first session of this council stated, "China must restore its territorial sovereignty and administrative integrity. This is the minimum position for any country to establish itself and survive. All Chinese nationals pledge to achieve this goal with all sacrifices." "The Chinese nation must mobilize all its material and human resources with a firm and unyielding will for self-defense and humanity, engaging in a long-term war of resistance with the aggressor until the day of final victory." This clarifies the objective of our country's war effort and is recognized by all our soldiers and civilians. For two years, the Japanese have relied on their material strength and military force, vainly attempting to conquer our country and enslave our people. As a result of our strong resistance, all their attempts have failed. China's current combat strength is not only superior to what it was a year ago but also exceeds that at the beginning of the war of resistance two years ago. Many council members have personally visited the front lines or inspected the rear areas, deeply feeling the uplifted morale of the military and the enhanced spirit of the people. Since last winter, progress in all areas has been significant. While we are pleased and grateful, we hope that all our soldiers and working personnel from all walks of life, and the loyal people in all regions, deeply recognize the changes in the enemy's situation. The day of victory in the war of resistance is near. It must be understood that ours is a sacred war of self-defense, while theirs is an army of aggression. We have moral authority, so we become stronger as we fight. They commit acts of aggression, so they become weaker over time. All our soldiers and civilians must grasp this general trend and understand this subtle point. Whether in the north or south, on the front lines or in the guerrilla zones, we must continue to strive and work hard to defeat the enemy. The rear provinces should strengthen the mobilization of human and material resources, which is self-evident. Council members, due to their responsibilities, cannot disclose military secrets or elaborate on strategies. We only hope that our compatriots will remember that China has a definite grasp of final victory, but this requires a long and arduous struggle, unity of purpose, and caution and bravery. This is what we hope for our compatriots to encourage each other. (2) Japan knows that it is impossible to conquer China by force, so it places equal emphasis on political and economic offensives. Their cunning is hateful, and their stupidity is laughable. The Republic of China is an independent country with sacred and inviolable sovereignty. The Chinese nation is an independent nation with a long history and rich cultural thought. These facts are jointly defended by the spirit and blood of the 450 million Chinese people and have been proven by the heroic resistance of all our soldiers and civilians for two years. If the aggressors cannot destroy it by force, they vainly attempt to steal it through cunning schemes? The declaration of the first session of this council stated long ago that the puppet organizations in the north and south, although claiming to be governments, do not have any political power and are only for nominal use. In international law, this is even inferior to the status of a protected country after losing its independence. Furthermore, the sacred and inviolable power of governance has been entrusted to the National Government by the public will of the people. Therefore, betraying the National Government is tantamount to betraying the Chinese nation. This council has already issued a special statement of condemnation. We further hope that all compatriots in the country will always remember the principle that sovereignty is inviolable, embrace the determination that loyalty and treachery cannot coexist, reject all deceptions, and shatter the enemy's delusions with facts. At the same time, we request our government to adopt the resolutions of this council and give advance warning to all countries not to fall for cunning schemes. We firmly believe that world public opinion can unanimously recognize the facts without doubt. (3) The outbreak of the European war is another misfortune for humanity. Tracing the origins of the disaster, Japan's violation of treaties and aggression against China eight years ago today is the root cause. Our country establishes itself on the basis of the Three Principles of the People. Our consistent foreign policy is to respect treaties, uphold good faith, oppose aggression, and love peace. Therefore, we attach great importance to obligations under the League of Nations Covenant, the Nine-Power Treaty, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, etc. Unfortunately, since the September 18th Incident, our friendly nations have failed to fully realize the effectiveness of various international covenants to stop Japan's aggression, leading to the increasing expansion of the war of aggression in East Asia. In Europe, the trend of militarism and aggression has also risen greatly under the influence of East Asia. The current outbreak of the European war is greatly influenced by East Asia. The council members, during this meeting, further reviewed the diplomatic situation. All agreed that our country's past policies were very appropriate. Now we wish that all our soldiers and civilians would pay special attention to the fact that interests and right and wrong must ultimately converge. Our country establishes itself on the basis of morality, and the Three Principles of the People are the embodiment of our country's moral essence. Therefore, the principle of nationalism is to seek freedom and equality for China and to respect the freedom and equality of other countries and nations, thereby opposing all wars of aggression and supporting all efforts to establish world peace. This is the public standard of right and wrong for humanity, which is also in our country's best interests. Since the war of resistance, our country has deeply gained the sympathy of the world. The declaration of the first session of this council already expressed its gratitude and comfort. From last winter to the present, the major signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty have mostly declared their firm stand to protect it. Those in the League of Nations meeting who have taken on the responsibility to assist China have also been able to fulfill their promises. Although the European war has broken out, this situation has not changed in the slightest. China should fulfill its obligations as a member of the League of Nations in regards to the European issue. What it especially wishes to take responsibility for is to strengthen the resistance to the conspiracies and atrocities of the aggressor country in East Asia, not only to defeat its plans to invade China but also to block its ambition to manipulate the international situation and oppress all countries. Our military and civilians must know that China's international status and credibility have been continuously enhanced as a result of two years of heroic self-defense, and that China, with a quarter of the world's population, is a major pillar of world peace. The future order, chaos, rise, and fall of East Asia all depend on China as its linchpin. At the same time, we deeply hope that Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union will recognize that the China-Japan issue is the central issue of the world and that Chinese nationals firmly believe that the completion of China's war of resistance and national construction is the most important factor for world peace and progress. No matter how the international situation changes, the ethical responsibility that the Republic of China strives to shoulder will always remain unchanged. This can be announced to the world. (4) Furthermore, we cannot help but say that although the end of the Japanese warlords is approaching, their ambition is not restrained. Coupled with international changes, this further stimulates their desire for speculation. Therefore, if China wants to implement its absolutely necessary war objective, it must mobilize its people and strengthen all facilities for a long-term war of resistance. The Fifth National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang had already resolved to convene the National Assembly on a fixed date to implement constitutional government. This was then postponed due to the outbreak of the war of resistance. Now, after two years of war resistance, all the loyal soldiers and civilians of our country support the Three Principles of the People and work hard in the war of resistance. The consolidation of national unity and the solidarity of the people's will have been deeply sympathized with and praised by the world. However, the Japanese warlords are making every effort to attack. We must not allow any complacency. All strengths must be developed, and all shortcomings must be addressed. As a result of careful deliberation, the council members believe that enhancing civil rights and strengthening the foundation of the country should be the most important tasks. Therefore, we dare to resolve to request the government to convene the National Assembly and establish a constitutional framework in accordance with the past resolutions of the Chinese Kuomintang. The council members believe that Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People are the common belief of our war of resistance and national construction, and the practice of the Three Principles of the People should be urgently formulated into a constitution to be passed on for permanence. Then all nationals who have already experienced the war of resistance today will be the common guarantee for upholding the constitution and practicing the Three Principles of the People. From then on, the foundation of the country will be greatly established, and there will be permanent peace and stability. It is not just to achieve the grand effect of encouraging people's hearts. The council members firmly believe that this session has made the most important contribution with this case. In addition to solemnly proposing to the government, we hope that all compatriots in the country will be more united and determined in their belief in the Three Principles of the People. Each will unite, observe discipline, and do their best to support constitutional government with love, sincerity, and dedication. Secondly, the council members deeply admire the government's attention to the policy of rear area construction. The Sichuan-Kang construction plan resolved at this session is the central issue for promoting the realization of this policy. In short, the focus of future war resistance work is still to strengthen the spiritual and material strength of the war resistance. The day when our military is fully strengthened is the day when the enemy's invasion collapses. The resolutions of this session are all aimed at the only goal of actively strengthening the strength of the war resistance. In addition to hoping that the government will adopt and implement them as much as possible, we must also encourage the unanimous support of all compatriots from all walks of life. Finally, we would like to offer one more word. The council members are familiar with the future and believe that our compatriots must always respect the soldiers who sacrifice themselves for the country, as well as all employees and local compatriots who directly or indirectly dedicate themselves to the arduous work of the war of resistance. All the blood and sweat shed at the front and in the rear over the past two years have obtained the highest price, that is, the facts have already shown that the independence of our country is inviolable and the freedom of the nation is indestructible. Japan has mobilized its entire army but cannot shake our will or destroy our spirit. Counting on nothing else, they continue to use their usual tactics of intimidation and inducement in an attempt to seize by clever means. This is a sign of the enemy's waning strength and exhaustion, and it is also proof that our country has already achieved victory in spirit. All compatriots in the country only need to recognize one key point, that is, today's China is historically unprecedentedly strong. Although it has not yet been able to drive the invaders out of the country immediately, our country's human and material resources are increasing day by day, while the enemy's strength is already declining. All our compatriots, bearing this heavy responsibility, at this time of crisis, their efforts will surely complete the rejuvenation of the nation, and their slackness will lead to becoming slaves of the enemy warlords. Glory or decline, life or death, are worlds apart, and we control it ourselves. Now, on the day of the adjournment of this council, we deeply wish that all compatriots in the country, in addition to deeply understanding the above points and working together, must recognize where the true grasp of our final victory lies and strive for it. Then we will see the day of its success. Not only will the territorial sovereignty and administrative integrity ensure that the country will never again be invaded by foreign enemies, but it will also advance to liberate the Japanese people who blindly follow the militarists in order to establish true peace in East Asia.

<h3>Japanese Army in Guangzhou Massively Arrests Civilians for Three Days, Over a Thousand Detained, City's Financial Situation Extremely Chaotic</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondent: Guangzhou's population had slightly increased compared to when it fell into enemy hands, mainly because of the recent foreign exchange contraction, and the devaluation of national and provincial currencies. Those who had previously stored national currency while residing in Hong Kong and Macau were severely affected, because the exchange rate between Hong Kong dollars and national currency was ten to three, meaning ten national dollars could only be exchanged for three Hong Kong dollars (the rate is even lower now, only between 28 to 29%). A middle-class family, if they had stored a thousand national dollars, originally could afford to live abroad for six months, but now they cannot live for three months. In addition, the war in the mainland is endless, and there is no production while living abroad. Those who are slightly aware of worldly affairs are all anxious and recklessly take the risk of returning to the mainland to reduce the burden and consumption of living abroad. Therefore, even before the outbreak of the European war, over ten thousand Cantonese residing in Hong Kong had returned to Guangzhou. After the outbreak of the European war, due to the circumstances in Hong Kong and Macau, and the Hong Kong government's order to evacuate the population, people from Hong Kong continued to return home in droves.</p>
<p>After Cantonese people returned to Guangzhou one after another, the city's market gradually regained some activity. The Japanese army then declared that it would withdraw thirty miles from Guangzhou city in the short term. However, this matter never materialized. At the beginning of this month, on the pretext that there were reports of Chinese troops in plainclothes infiltrating the city, a large number of Japanese troops were suddenly increased from outside the city, and martial law was declared inside and outside the city for three days. Troops were dispatched to encircle and arrest people in the Nantian Cai Lan, Xiguan Longjin Road, and Dongmen Xicun areas, searching houses one by one. Any unfamiliar strong men were arrested. At the same time, Japanese troops were dispatched to the Tenth Fu, Yonghan Road, and Taiping South Road, and directly went to major tea houses, questioning the tea drinkers one by one, and using force to test the tea drinkers' expressions. Those who were slightly suspicious or looked cowardly were arrested regardless of their innocence. It is estimated that after three days of harassment, over a thousand citizens were arrested and suffered inhumane treatment. The checkpoints at various road intersections in the city, which had been removed at one point, have recently been restored, and the treatment of citizens is extremely harsh. Therefore, most of the residents who had returned were disappointed and fled the city again to other places. Consequently, the shops are still nine out of ten empty, and the ironware of the uninhabited households has been dismantled by bandits, and even the beams and timber have been dismantled for firewood. Most of the tall buildings have been reduced to rubble. The Chang Le Street and Eighteenth Fu markets in Xiguan, which used to be prosperous commercial areas, have been reduced to scorched earth after the Japanese army entered the city and set fire for several days. To this day, it is still a desolate scene. The machines of the former provincial-run factories, and the machinery of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway Bureau and the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Bureau, have all been plundered. The railway steel rails have also been dismantled and transported to the east. Therefore, from the current situation, the essence of Guangzhou, whether public or private, has been exhausted. Looking back on the past, the entire city is nothing more than a desolate and abandoned market.</p>
<p>The city's financial situation is currently extremely chaotic, which is a natural trend. Currency is a thing that exists on faith. If people do not share faith in it, then a thousand gold certificates will become waste paper. The Japanese army, occupying the city, has no love for aliens. In terms of finance, if it can raise funds locally, it will start to exploit and strip them. If it is not easy to obtain, it will issue its military currency indiscriminately. The chaos in the city's finances is like the Qin people viewing the Yue people's fat and lean. Even if the original "Guangdong Provincial banknotes" are completely worthless, this is what the Japanese cannot obtain. Therefore, the ability of Guangzhou's finances to maintain itself depends entirely on whether the existing citizens are able to realize and maintain a common belief. Otherwise, they will dig their own graves, and others will be happy to loot the fire. Who is to blame? It is heard that the Guangzhou Municipal Bank's vouchers are no longer valid (the direct loss to citizens has reached four to five million yuan). As for the provincial bank's small notes, they are inexplicably divided into several types. They are the same paper currency, but those with the signature of a certain person are still circulating, while those with the signature of another person cannot be used. Those that are usable but slightly damaged cannot be used. Such a variety of practices, if the voucher holder is not careful, will suffer losses. As a result, the Japanese military tickets are issued even more, exchanging foreign currency. It is rumored that the Japanese are planning to organize a certain bank in Guangzhou to issue counterfeit banknotes to exchange old tickets. If this happens, the financial and property rights of the entire city will fall into the hands of the Japanese. Social relations have changed little on the surface. British expatriates still go to the "enemy" residences to drink. The emotions of the two sides may be vastly different, but the appearance is quite friendly. The British Consul in Dalian has not yet received instructions from his home government. British ships berthed in Dalian, under the order of the Naval Department, are temporarily not sailing out. Three German ships are also berthed in the port of Dalian, loading soybeans. When Hitler sent his troops to war, two of the ships had already completed loading soybeans and were about to transport them to Japan, but there was a risk of being captured by British warships, so they remained in the port. The German ships' management office is currently negotiating with the Japanese government to have the Japanese navy escort the two ships to Japan. However, according to the general opinion here, this matter is unlikely. It is said that the third German ship stopped loading cargo when the European war broke out. They are all currently berthed in Dalian. Currently, dysentery and typhoid fever are spreading here. Most of those suffering from dysentery are Chinese, about fifteen cases a day, while almost all those suffering from typhoid fever are Japanese, about thirty cases a day, sometimes increasing to as many as forty cases.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in Shandong Eliminates Puppet Troops, Fang Yongchang Appointed Puppet Daoyin of Southern Shandong, Zhang Buyun and Zhang Zongyuan Fall Out of Favor</h3>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondent: The Japanese army entrenched in Shandong Province has now appointed Fang Yongchang as the Daoyin of Southern Shandong and is starting to recruit and appease large and small bandits in various parts of Southern Shandong. However, because the puppet suppression of the Communist Fourth Route Army, led by Zhang Buyun, has a larger force and they are afraid that they will not be easy to command, they recently feigned an inspection and planned to seize their weapons by surprise. Zhang discovered this and led his troops to withdraw to the Songjiatong Xudonggang Jingzhizhen southwest area. It is reported that Zhang's four brigade commanders and chief of staff were detained by the Japanese. Currently, four Japanese troop trains have arrived at the Gaomi station. There are rumors that they will solve both Zhang Zongyuan's and Zhang Buyun's troops at the same time.</p>
<h3>Headquarters of the Shandong-Jiangsu War Zone Strictly Prohibits the Confiscation of Civilian Guns</h3>
<p>The Deputy Commander-in-Chief's Office of the Shandong-Jiangsu War Zone issued a notice yesterday, roughly stating that during this period of war resistance, it is essential to establish the people's self-defense forces to maintain social order and tranquility. It is reported that recently, some troops have been confiscating civilian guns everywhere under the guise of resisting the war, and arbitrarily labeling people as traitors in order to extort money and kill lives indiscriminately, which is extremely hateful. In the future, no troops may confiscate civilian guns unless approved by the Headquarters of the War Zone. In case of traitor cases, they should be handled by military agencies, troops, or administrative and judicial agencies in accordance with the law to show prudence. If there is any violation, once discovered, it will be severely punished without leniency.</p>
<h3>Recent Situation in Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Most Traitors are Subdued</p>
<p>A visitor from Jiangyin said that there are currently about 200 Japanese soldiers in the urban area of Jiangyin, stationed in Weicun Middle School and Beiwai Dong'an in the city. They have outposts at the West City Gate and Xinbei Gate. They also regularly check pedestrians at the Puhui Bridge. The areas along the Chengxi Road, such as Nanzha Qingyangtangtou Bridge, and Nanxiang Qiaoqi Dongxiang Beiguo, all have Japanese troops stationed. They patrol and demonstrate with speedboats. Recently, 100 new soldiers were transported from Japan. They train in the city's stadium every day. Most of them are merchants. Japanese soldiers go to various towns and villages every day to promote propaganda. Every time they arrive, they must first set up machine guns on the streets and alleys to prevent guerrilla attacks, and then send out teams to distribute various propaganda materials. The tone is nothing more than "China and Japan practice friendship," "China and Japan are of the same race," "China cannot become rich and strong without leaving Japan" and other nonsense. He Peixuan, the puppet governor of Jiangyin (ie He Peixuan), is over sixty years old, confused and incompetent. The clerks of the puppet county office's secretarial section, accounting, and other positions are all He's sons and daughters-in-law. They have a total salary of more than two thousand yuan per month. Therefore, the puppet organization of Jiangyin has been contracted by the He family.</p>
<p>More than dozens of Jiangyin traitors have been captured and executed by the Chinese side, including Wu Liyong, Gao Xueqin, Yang Hanqing, Xu Muhan, and Xu Mengjin. As a result, the traitors were shocked and terrified. Recently, many have deeply repented and requested to surrender themselves. The Japanese propaganda team and the military police have become suspicious of these traitors due to the lack of work performance, even suspecting them of colluding with the guerrillas. They are arrested and imprisoned at every turn and forced to confess. A certain special agent captured a traitor named Jin Caiyun outside Junshan Road in the north of the city the other day. It is said that Jin was a former informant for the Japanese propaganda team and was usually trusted by the Japanese.</p>
<h3>Statistics on Japanese Bombing of Zhangzhou</h3>
<p>More than Two Hundred Bombs Dropped</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondent: Since mid-May, the Japanese air force has bombed Zhangzhou for three months, ten bombing days and twenty-five bombing raids, with the number of bombs dropped exceeding two hundred and fifty, and over two hundred houses of various sizes have been destroyed.</p>
<h3>Puppet Manchu Government Implements Control of Soybean Trade; Dalian Suffers Great Loss from Hurricane</h3>
<p>*Zi Lin Bao*, Dalian, September 10th dispatch states: Foreign and Japanese soybean exporters in the Northeast Provinces have long feared that soybean trading would be completely controlled. Now, the "Manchu Government" has finally decided to implement this total control from November 1st. A Soybean Control Company will soon be established, specializing in soybeans and soybean products. Not only soybeans themselves, but also soybean cakes and soybean oil will be controlled. It is expected that a company to control oil extraction will also be established. This move is another monopoly by the "government," making it impossible for private individuals to operate. It seems unlikely that foreign businesses, which have spent decades bringing their commerce to its current prosperous state, will be permitted any scope for activity. This plan is bound to meet with much opposition, as previous discussions of this plan have shown. However, whether it will be beneficial remains to be seen in the future.</p>
<p>Last month, Dalian experienced unusually hot weather, and at the end of the month, it was suddenly hit by a hurricane. Trees were uprooted, and the sea surged violently. The wharf was flooded by seawater to a depth of over three feet. Small boats on the sea were lifted high by the waves and then capsized, some even being thrown into the air for a moment before falling and sinking. Lushun was also hit by the hurricane, and both places suffered heavy losses. It is estimated that the goods stored in the wharves and warehouses suffered at least 5 million Japanese yen in losses. The wind and torrential rain were so fierce that Dalian had not seen anything like it in many years. One of the two major power stations was flooded, and the electricity was cut off. Some parts of Dalian still had water and electricity, but the commercial and entertainment districts were as dark as during the recent air raid drills.</p>
<p>Although there are very few British residents in Dalian within the age limit for active service, they are deeply concerned about Britain's efforts to prevent Germany from re-invading small European countries. After the outbreak of war, the interactions between the British and German residents of Dalian...</p>

<h3>Unprecedented Scene on Nanjing Road: New Record Since the August 13th Battle; Grand Opening of Dachangxiang Silk Store</h3>
<p>Dachangxiang Silk Store is organized by major Shanghai merchants. Manager Cao Fengsheng is skilled and resourceful, and has a certain standing in the silk industry. This spring, he took over all the remaining stock of Dachang Xieji Silk Store at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Shanxi Road in front of the market. Soon after, he held a grand clearance sale of the remaining stock at the inventory price, which caused a sensation. After the clearance sale, the store immediately renovated the old facade, turning it into the most beautiful and fashionable modern facade with a three-dimensional design. It is magnificent and unparalleled, and the location is central and convenient for everyone. Therefore, even during the renovation period, ladies from all walks of life were eagerly looking forward to it, and many inquired about the opening date every day. Mr. Cao politely declined, saying that the arrangements were not yet complete, which shows the general attention of society. Because Mr. Cao has frequent interactions with wealthy families in Shanghai, and knows many ladies from prominent families, distinguished customers automatically patronize the store. Moreover, his staff is mostly composed of experienced and knowledgeable people in the silk industry, so he can make a sensation with just one call.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the first day of the grand opening of Dachangxiang Silk Store. At seven o'clock in the morning, the intersection of Nanjing Road and Shanxi Road was already crowded with people. The traffic was almost cut off. After the unveiling, the crowd surged like a tide. In an instant, the spacious store was filled with people. Fortunately, the store had prepared a large number of staff, so they were able to cope with the excessive crowding calmly. Many ladies were willing to endure hunger and heat in order to get these unexpected bargains, and they all left satisfied.</p>
<p>To commemorate the grand opening, Dachangxiang Silk Store specially offered thousands of sacrificial cheongsam fabrics. Each of these cheongsam fabrics would cost several yuan or more at cost. Now, they are selling for only one yuan, but only those who have obtained a preferential coupon for sacrificial items can purchase them. The acquisition of preferential coupons is very limited, but those who are regular customers of the store or have substantial transactions will naturally have this preferential treatment. If the sales situation yesterday is any indication, the remaining stock of these sacrificial items may be exhausted soon. Those who are quick will get them first. Nanjing Road is the central area of Shanghai, where commerce is concentrated. Since August 13th, there has not been such a grand scene for a long time. Now, Dachangxiang Silk Store has made an amazing move, creating a new record since the war and rapidly taking the lead in the silk industry in this city.</p>

<p>Business of Dachangxiang Silk Store is booming</p>
<h3>Japanese Defense Zone North of the Suzhou Creek Slightly Extended; Extends from North Jiangxi Road to North Henan Road; No Barbed Wire Set Up in This Area; More Puppet Police in the Shanghai West Extraterritorial Road Area</h3>
<p>After the Japanese and puppet military police took action on the extraterritorial roads in Shanghai West, there were rumors that the Japanese military would demand that the British military withdraw from the area north of the Suzhou Creek and be replaced by the Japanese military. This area includes the section from North Jiangxi Road to North Xizang Road. As a result, the people living north of the Suzhou Creek are uneasy. Recently, the goods of various businesses stored in the warehouses of various banks north of the Suzhou Creek have been moved out. Hardware stores, ironmongers, etc., are also moving valuable hardware and iron materials to the south of the Suzhou Creek. The fact that the Japanese military convened a meeting of defense military officials from various countries in Shanghai has further fueled anxiety.</p>
<p>Japanese Defense Zone Slightly Extended</p>
<p>However, yesterday afternoon, it was suddenly reported that the Japanese military would take over the entire area north of the Suzhou Creek tomorrow. In order to find out the truth, the reporter made inquiries with various parties concerned to find out whether the news was indeed true. Reliable information has been obtained, proving that the above rumors are not true. However, it is not without cause. From the 22nd of this month, the Japanese military's defense zone north of the Suzhou Creek will indeed be slightly extended, from North Jiangxi Road to North Henan Road. This fact has been confirmed. The British troops will withdraw from North Jiangxi Road to the west of North Henan Road at that time.</p>
<p>Extended Area Has No Obstacles</p>
<p>However, it has been agreed by both parties that no obstacles such as barbed wire will be erected in the area extended by the Japanese military. Only the Japanese military will send patrols. Before the August 13th battle, the Huizhong Police Station and the Hongkou Police Station originally used North Henan Road as the boundary. The Hongkou Police Station had jurisdiction up to the east and west steps of North Henan Road. Since Hongkou became a war zone after the war, the Huizhong Police Station took over part of the jurisdiction of the Hongkou Police Station up to North Sichuan Road. Since the Hongkou Police Station restored its original police status, this measure has continued. The decision to change it now is actually to restore the original state.</p>
<p>Huizhong Police Station Reassures Residents</p>
<p>In order to reassure the residents living on the eastern half of North Henan Road, the Huizhong Police Station has sent personnel to inform the residents of the principles and instructed them to live in peace and not be alarmed. Even if the Japanese military comes to investigate, they are instructed to tell the actual situation. If there are any police incidents, they can still call the police station, and the police station will still handle them. According to another message obtained by the reporter, the iron gates connecting the Zhabei border will be opened soon, so that people going to Zhabei will not have to detour. However, whether this statement is true is difficult to prove for the time being and must await future verification. Therefore, residents living north of the Suzhou Creek can rest assured.</p>
<p>Negotiations Between the Two Sides Have Not Yet Yielded Results</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of extraterritorial road construction, the reporter specifically visited a senior official of the British Consulate yesterday. According to him, the Japanese pressure on the Concession authorities has become more active since the outbreak of the European War. Recently, they have again sought to obtain the police power of extraterritorial road construction, threatening to resolve the issue by force and exerting much pressure. In order to ease the situation, the Municipal Council began negotiations with the Japanese puppet regime, but no results have been seen so far. The reporter then asked about the extraterritorial road construction negotiations. It was rumored that a solution could be reached within ten days or half a month, but the official did not give a firm confirmation.</p>
<p>Some Detectives Have Already Been Withdrawn</p>
<p>Although the Municipal Council has denied abandoning police power in the Shanghai West extraterritorial road area on the morning of the 17th, reporters from Da Zhong She went to the area yesterday afternoon for an on-the-spot inspection and saw that the Concession patrolmen on Bailinan Road, Jessfield Road, and Caojiadu had almost completely withdrawn. The task of directing traffic has been taken over by the puppet police. However, Concession patrolmen are still stationed on Xiyuan Road. At the entrances of various alleys, except for Zhongshi New Village and Siming Villa, which are guarded by puppet police, other alleys are still guarded by volunteer police from the police station. This shows that there must be a considerable tacit understanding between the Municipal Council and the Japanese puppet regime. Yesterday, plainclothes agents from the Japanese puppet regime were densely distributed in the extraterritorial road area, and residents and pedestrians were uneasy and warned each other to be careful in their speech. It can be seen that the situation in the area has actually changed.</p>
<p>Number of Puppet Police on Posts Suddenly Increased</p>
<p>There is still only one puppet policeman stationed at the entrances of Zhongshi New Village and Siming Villa on Xiyuan Road. However, the number of puppet policemen in Qianjia Alley, opposite Yuguang Village, suddenly increased to eight. The four puppet policemen stationed in front of the employee dormitory of the Toyota Textile Factory at 1249 Yuyuan Road remained the same yesterday. The puppet police stationed next to the gate of Zhaofeng Park on Bailinan Road were still three yesterday. The two gate patrolmen originally sent by the police station suddenly disappeared yesterday. However, there are still many tourists coming and going to the park. From the intersection of Jessfield Road and Avenue Edward VII, along the way such as Kangjia Bridge, Jinjia Alley, Malu Bridge, Connaught Road, to Caojiadu, there have been puppet police stationed at posts for several days. Yesterday, the number of puppet police at each post suddenly increased. Armed puppet police, led by squad leaders, patrolled back and forth, looking arrogant. The citizens along the street looked at them askance. There were also four puppet police at the entrance of Sanyi Fang, a newly established post.</p>
<p>Security Strengthened in the Concession Border Area</p>
<p>The Lin mansion at 448 Haig Road was occupied by the Japanese puppet regime, and a side door was opened on the east side of the house, with sandbags piled up and posts set up. However, the side door was suddenly sealed off and impassable from the day before yesterday, and people still entered and exited through the main gate. Yesterday, the sandbags next to the side door were also removed, and fortifications were built in front of the main gate, with six or seven armed puppet police stationed there. It is speculated that their intention is to concentrate their forces to guard the main gate. On Haig Road, the armored vehicles of the French Police Station patrolled even more frequently, and a large team of Annamese patrolmen followed the vehicles on foot, searching suspicious pedestrians and vehicles along the way.</p>
<p>Slight Changes in the British Defense Zone</p>
<p>Regarding the adjustment of the defense zones of the troops stationed in various countries, according to a senior official of the British Consulate, speaking to the Da Zhong She reporter, since the commander of the Naval Landing Force, An, convened a meeting of the commanders of the British, American, and Italian troops stationed in Shanghai on the 13th of this month to seek the consent of the commanders of various countries, the countries concerned have proceeded to discuss it. The Japanese side's proposal to adjust the defense zone is based on the fact that it has been two years since the last adjustment, and according to precedent, it should be adjusted again this time. Therefore, various countries have no objection to it. The United Kingdom and the United States have successively expressed their agreement. What is to be discussed today is not whether to adjust, but the content of the specific plan for the adjustment, that is, how to adjust. However, the Japanese side and the British and American sides have not yet put forward a specific plan, so the adjustment of the defense zones of the troops stationed in various countries will not be realized in the short term. At present, the British side has put forward two conditions regarding the Japanese side's desire to take over the British defense zone from North Jiangxi Road to North Henan Road: (1) The defense zone should not be filled by the Japanese side; (2) Residents should not use passes to enter and exit. The Japanese side has not yet made any indication on this, but it is rumored that the British army will cede the defense zone on the 22nd.</p>
<p>French Consul-General to Visit Fu Xiao'an</p>
<p>According to the English-language *China Press*, the Japanese-language *Continental News* reported that the French Consul-General in Shanghai, Baudoin, is expected to visit "Mayor" Fu Xiao'an soon to have amicable discussions on the Special Court and other unresolved issues between the French Concession Public Works Department and the "Shanghai Municipal Government." It is hoped that these issues can be satisfactorily resolved soon. Since August 21, the French Vice-Consul in Shanghai, Cadant, has repeatedly consulted with Fu at the "Municipal Government" office in the downtown area.</p>
<p>Admiral Hepburn Returned to Qingdao Yesterday</p>
<p>On the morning of September 14, the Japanese side invited commanders of defense forces stationed in Shanghai from various countries to a meeting. In the afternoon, Admiral Hepburn, commander of the U.S. Fleet in China, immediately left Qingdao and took the USS Isabel to Shanghai, arriving at 11 a.m. on the 15th. He met with the U.S. Consul-General in Shanghai, Gauss. Outsiders believe that Admiral Hepburn's sudden visit to Shanghai must be related to the defense forces meeting and that Hepburn would provide his opinion. It is now known that Hepburn has already returned north to Qingdao on the original ship at 3 p.m. yesterday (the 19th), but the purpose of his visit to Shanghai has not yet been revealed.</p>
<h3>Financial Markets Stabilize After Song Fei Su Denials; Rumors of Peace in the Market Yesterday Afternoon Led to Further Gold Decline and Continued Government Bond Rise</h3>
<p>After the fall of Shanghai, the financial market, beyond the reach of government power, has become a place for speculators to make waves. Thus, general speculators arbitrarily create rumors to seek profit. The market on the day before yesterday experienced dramatic changes in the black market for foreign exchange, gold, and securities due to the transmission that Song Ziwens flew to the Soviet Union. Starting yesterday morning, because Chongqing has firmly denied this statement, the market</p>
<p>Rumors gradually subsided and people's minds were slightly at ease. Prices of foreign exchange and other items have stabilized slightly.

<p>The United Charities office in Renji Hall, Yunnan Road, this city, has been closed. A "Liquidation Committee" has been established. It is now being handled because of various relationships. The committee has two groups underneath, investigation and repatriation. As of yesterday, the association was still sheltering 18,641 refugees, men and women, divided into 14 shelters. The repatriation period is divided into three stages, each lasting three weeks, to be completed within two months.

After verification by the investigation group of the liquidation committee, they will then consider whether to accommodate them or merge them all in one place. Therefore, the association authorities are still conducting thorough research and investigation. The measures to be taken by the association for the repatriation of refugees are outlined below:</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Has Telegraphed Instructions for Issuance of New Auxiliary Currency Notes; Exchange for Corner Notes is Unusually Enthusiastic; Casting Nickel Coins is Not a Fact</h3>
<p>The Central Bank issues new notes, whether legal tender corner notes, etc., in accordance with the instructions of the head office. The issue of fractional currency is expected to be done soon as the order from the Ministry of Finance has been received, but the exact date has not been determined. Also, the bank has indeed transported a large number of new notes recently, but the authorities have not allowed the true situation to be revealed. According to inquiries from the bank's issuing department, since the National Army withdrew to the west and the Central Mint stopped working, the bank only continued to issue the two-corner, one-corner, and five-fen nickel coins accumulated over the years for circulation in the market. Later, the head office transported a large number of two-corner and one-corner notes from Hong Kong, which was sufficient to meet the needs of the market, so the issuance of nickel coins was immediately stopped. Recently, various parties have enthusiastically exchanged corner notes for those who lack auxiliary currency, and the daily amount exchanged has exceeded seven or eight tenths of the past. The previous rumor that the bank will continue to cast nickel coins is not true.</p>

<h3>Nationals of Warring Countries Take the Swedish Ship; Not Refused</h3>
<p>Shanghai-Ningbo ships come and go in an endless stream; Shanghai-Wenzhou parcels have not been restored. After the outbreak of the European War, in order to maintain neutrality, some shipping companies refused to allow nationals of warring countries to board their ships. However, the reporter learned that the ships operated by the Swedish company Weichang Trading Company in this port, such as the *Beiping*, *Nanjing*, *Ningbo*, *Shandong*, and *Magella*, although may suspend their operations in Europe and Asia due to the impact of the war, the company's ships do not refuse to carry nationals of warring countries. It is said that some of the company's ships will change their routes in Shanghai separately.</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Ningbo transport and Shanghai-Wenzhou routes were once restored last week, but were again obstructed by the Japanese Navy, resulting in another suspension. Freight transport on the Shanghai-Ningbo line has been fairly good recently, so ships have been added to sail repeatedly. The *Haida*, a new ship of the Sino-Italian Company, will make its maiden voyage to Ningbo at 4 p.m. yesterday. The *Feikang* of the Lulin Shipping Department is scheduled to resume sailing on the Shanghai-Ningbo line this afternoon. The *Hanna* of the Far East Company is scheduled to continue sailing to Zhenhaikou tomorrow. The *Moufou* of the Lihe Trading Company returned to Shanghai last Friday, and has not yet decided whether to continue sailing to Zhenhai as of yesterday. The *Deping* is scheduled to return to Shanghai on the 25th and continue sailing to Zhenhai on the 27th or 28th. The *Dabu* of the Sino-Italian Company also plans to join the Shanghai-Ningbo line after arriving in Shanghai on the 25th. The *Haifu* and *Maily* will return to Shanghai after the *Deping*. The date of sailing to Ningbo must be determined after it is their turn.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Wenzhou Parcels: The Shanghai Postal Administration originally scheduled to officially receive personal parcels for Fuzhou and Wenzhou from this port from the day before yesterday. However, due to the obstruction of the Wenzhou voyage again, the Wenzhou personal parcels have not been restored. However, the Shanghai-Fujian parcels have been received.</p>
<h3>Public Concession Lifts Alert; Traffic Resumes</h3>
<p>However, the Iron Gate at the Intersection of North Zhejiang Road and Avenue Edouard VII is Not Fully Open</p>
<p>On the anniversary of September 18, the Public Concession Police Department took the necessary precautions, closing unnecessary roads and mobilizing detectives to implement security, but it was not as serious as August 13. The process went very well, so the police's alert was lifted at midnight on that day and restored to its normal state. Bridges over the Suzhou Creek are allowed to pass. Roads connecting the French Concession that were closed have also been opened. Trolleybuses on Route 18 do not need to detour due to the lifting of the alert on the Yu Qiaqing Road Bridge. As for trams on Routes 5, 6, and 7, they are still turning around in front of the Special Second Court because the iron gate at the intersection of North Zhejiang Road and Avenue Edouard VII has not been fully opened. Otherwise, they have all returned to their original state.</p>
<h3>President Kong's Birthday; Celebration Canceled</h3>
<p>Friendly Birthday Gifts Transferred to Disaster Relief; Collected by the Central Bank on Behalf</p>
<p>Yesterday was the 60th birthday of President Kong of the Executive Yuan.

Friends from all over the country, in order to appreciate President Kong's concern for the victims, have transferred their birthday gifts to winter clothing donations and relief funds, which were collected by the Central Bank on behalf of the governments in various regions.</p>
<h3>Prohibited Import Items; Special Import Permits</h3>
<p>Notices Posted by Customs Offices in Various Regions; Jianghai Customs, etc., Have Not Yet Implemented Them</p>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance promulgated the Measures for Prohibiting the Import of Goods and the List of Imported Goods during the Extraordinary Period, the import of all necessities, in addition to providing foreign exchange, is also subject to a levy of one-fifth of the current import tax rate. The import of prohibited goods, if approved by government agencies due to the regulation of market prices in the rear, the supply of special uses, or other legitimate reasons, may be reviewed by the Ministry.</p>
<p>Based on actual needs, import permits were issued. The measures for the permits have been transferred by the Ministry to the General Taxation Department for compliance by various customs offices. The implementation notices issued by the customs offices are recorded below: "Now, according to the telegraphic order of the Ministry of Finance, the measures for obtaining import permits for prohibited import items during the extraordinary period are formulated in accordance with the provisions of the Measures for Prohibiting the Import of Goods during the Extraordinary Period. Instructed to</p>
<p>promulgate and implement, etc. Therefore, the gist is hereby promulgated as follows: (1) Import permits are divided into two types: special-purpose permits and commercial sales permits. (2) Customs may allow the import of goods with one of the above two types of permits after collecting taxes in accordance with the current customs regulations.</p>
<p>After verification and release, Customs shall forward the permit to the Ministry of Finance for record. (4) When goods specially permitted for import are transshipped to the interior for distribution through land and water borders, the name and quantity of the goods shall be recorded for inspection along the way. The Shanghai Customs and other customs offices in the occupied areas have not yet implemented the above measures due to the special environment.</p>
<h3>The Tianjin Four Chinese Case: British Assessor's Court Has Not Ruled; the Four Have Already Been Extradited, Nothing Can Be Done; Petitioners May Not Appeal in the Future</h3>
<p>The English-language *North China Daily Mail* reports that the British Assessor's Court in China has not yet ruled on the writ of *habeas corpus* regarding the case of the four Chinese terror suspects in Tianjin. The report in the *Morning Post* [another newspaper] this morning [reporting that a ruling had been made] is inaccurate.</p>
<p>*The China Press* reports that Jones, a judge of the British Assessor's Court in China, concluded the sensational case of testing British law last Wednesday, ruling that a writ of *habeas corpus* could not be issued for the four Chinese suspects in the Cheng assassination case in Tianjin to bring them to the British court because the four defendants were not British subjects. It was learned yesterday (the 18th) that the petitioners may not appeal this judgment to a higher British court, as the four defendants have already been handed over to the local Tianjin District Court, and</p>
<p>Jones, a lawyer from the law firm of Ellis &amp; Hayes, who defended the four defendants, has now gone to Japan. Before the verdict, Judge Jones explained the circumstances of issuing the writ to the Tianjin prison authorities regarding the four defendants. It is claimed that the issuance of the writ and the date of issuance are irrelevant to his judgment. The judgment is that a writ of *habeas corpus* cannot be used to bring the four Chinese defendants to the Assessor's Court.</p>
<p>The application of the writ of *habeas corpus* seems to be limited to British subjects and those under British protection, and the person requesting the writ in this case is not one of the two mentioned above. In other words, in his opinion, if the writ of *habeas corpus* were granted for the summons, it would extend the protection of *habeas corpus* law to an unprecedented extent regarding the extradition of the four persons,</p>
<p>it is too late, and nothing can be done. The initial purpose of the writ is to bring the person held in custody to court. Since this is no longer possible, the writ should not be issued. It is noted that when the British Assessor's Court heard the summons on the 11th of this month, Jones, the defender of the four defendants, argued that the British military commander in Tianjin, knowing that the British Assessor's Court judge had sent a summons to him, handed over the suspects to the Japanese puppet court, which was in fact</p>
<p>contempt of court. Judge Jones did not discuss this matter in his judgment, but only pointed out that the British military commander in Tianjin, at the request of the British Consul-General in Tianjin, took the four defendants from the British Concession Police Department on June 7 and was responsible for their detention. Later, at the request of the British Consul-General, the four defendants were handed over to the police department for transportation on September 5. Therefore, when the summons was issued on August 31, the four defendants were</p>
<p>under the custody of the British military commander, but when the summons was delivered on September 6, the four defendants were no longer detained by the British military commander. According to legal circles in this city last night, even if the summons had arrived in time, it would have been found that if a British military officer did not comply with the court summons due to fulfilling a special order from the British government, it could not be called contempt of court.</p>
<h3>Tram Company Issues New Tickets</h3>
<p>Advises Passengers Not to Use Them Elsewhere</p>
<p>The Public Concession Tram Company has discovered counterfeiting of the fare tickets issued in June, July, August and March. After announcing a deadline until today (20th), new fare tickets of three types, one, two, and three, have also been issued for use, but the number is small. The company hopes that passengers will not use these fare tickets elsewhere. An urgent notice has been issued as follows: Tram fare tickets can only be used on trams and trolleybuses. Please do not use them elsewhere. If passengers can follow this advice, it will greatly help the ticket sellers' work and make it easier to get change. Passengers are requested to cooperate on this matter. This notice.</p>
<h3>Refugee Relief Association Holds Fundraising Meeting</h3>
<p>Original Pledged Donations Urged to Extend; Public Announcement Explains Difficulties</p>
<p>The Fundraising Committee of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association held a joint meeting of the Standing Committee, heads of various groups, and executive directors yesterday. Yu Qiaqing and over twenty other people attended. Fang Jiaobo presided. From the establishment in November of the 27th year [1938] to the end of August of this year, a total of more than 2,595,000 yuan was received in donations. The results were best in March and April of this year, and slightly inferior in July and August. Income has gradually decreased, while the living allowance for refugees has increased from two yuan per person per month to five yuan per person per month due to soaring prices.

<h3>Those Selling Rice at Discounted Prices Should Strictly Maintain Order; An Elderly Person Was Injured in the Third District Yesterday; Discount Sales Were Suspended Twice Before Returning to Normal</h3>
<p>The sale of foreign rice at discounted prices, which is entrusted by various groups in this city to the Le Gong Association Rice Shop, was suspended for one day due to "September 18th." [Mukden Incident] Yesterday, it continued. The discounted sales point in the third district (namely, the Jade Buddha Temple on Gordon Road) started selling at 8:00 a.m. yesterday. Civilians buying rice flocked to it, and the number reached more than 5,000 people. Many people rushed to the front, causing the detectives dispatched by the police to be unable to maintain order for a while. An elderly person of more than sixty years old whose name is unknown was injured in the crush. Seeing that the situation was not good, the detectives immediately notified the temporary suspension of the discount sales, rescued the injured person, and sent them to the nearby Labor Hospital for treatment. At the same time, the rice buyers were ordered to line up and enter one after another. At about 9:00 a.m., the sales were resumed, but the discount sales were temporarily suspended again due to the excessive number of people and poor order. Coarse hemp ropes were added to block the area, and the detectives closely monitored the situation. After the sales opened at 11:15 a.m., the order improved. By 12:45 p.m., 200 bags of foreign rice had been sold out, and the sales were announced to be stopped in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Other Districts: Good Order</p>
<p>In addition, 300 bags of rice were distributed in the first district and sold out by 1:00 p.m. Sales were stopped in the afternoon. 200 bags of rice were distributed in the second and fourth districts, and 300 bags of rice were distributed in the fifth district. Sales were stopped at 6:00 p.m. The order was excellent and no incidents occurred. It is heard that the discounted sales will continue today until all 8,000 bags are sold out.</p>
<p>Collecting Rice Tickets: Distributing to the Extremely Poor</p>
<p>A certain female philanthropist witnessed civilians fighting to buy discounted rice, being pushed down, injured, or even killed. She went to the third district yesterday to buy ten rice tickets, worth a total of twenty yuan in national currency, and distributed them to the poorer citizens in the area. When a reporter from the *New Voice* newspaper asked for her name, the lady refused to reveal it.</p>
<p>Bean and Rice Market: Sampling Restored</p>
<p>The Bean and Rice Market Management Committee, in view of the disputes among traders and merchants after the temporary suspension of sampling, has now decided at the 40th resolution meeting to resume sampling immediately. The eighth circular is drafted and issued, stating, "According to the decision of the 45th resolution management committee meeting, the public sampling office will resume sampling immediately. Any disputes for those who have not issued samples will not be accepted. The relevant records are publicly announced for all merchants to take note of." Yesterday, the prices of all goods in the market fell by about one yuan.</p>
<p>Today's Limit: 1,000 Bags to be Sold</p>
<p>It is heard that starting today, the five discounted sales points will each sell 100 bags, with a limit of 1,000 bags. The second discounted sale is also being planned. However, in view of the crowded situation and poor order, the chairman of the association convened a meeting of the heads of each point the day before yesterday and put forward an opinion, which was submitted to the Assistance Association. If the second discounted sale is implemented, it is proposed that each rice shop in the lane and Taoist election section be responsible for selling tickets, so that during the discounted sale, the order, time, and manpower can be further improved. The association has sent one person to each of the five discounted sales points to supervise, so all economic income and expenditure, in addition to the necessary moving funds, plus small numbers such as the placement of paper, etc., are sent to the association. The staff of each point also do their best to fulfill their obligations. The staff of the discounted sales points are all drawn from the rice shops. The Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching, and the store affairs are complicated, so it is convenient for both the public and private to complete the sales as soon as possible. However, the staff of each point serve the civilians all day long without any complaints. On the contrary, they feel comforted. The present Rice Shop Association has remitted 31,000 yuan from the two-day discounted sales to the bank, and the details will be published to the public in the future.</p>
<h3>The Thrift Movement Committee Advises: Do Not Hoard Goods and Speculate; Citizens Should Be Conscientious and Not Seize Excessive Profits; So That Prices Can Return to Normal and Social Harmony Can Be Maintained Together</h3>
<p>The Thrift Movement Committee of this city previously stated that due to the tightening of foreign exchange, various industries have raised prices one after another, and even commodities unrelated to foreign exchange have taken the opportunity to increase prices, resulting in a general increase in prices and a serious threat to the livelihood of ordinary people. Therefore, it issued a public announcement, calling on various industries to quickly stop the increase voluntarily, so as not to affect social order. However, since</p>
<p>the outbreak of the European War, general merchants have once again manipulated and speculated, and even people outside the industry have purchased various commodities at high prices, hoarding them in large quantities, attempting to raise prices and sell them, resulting in irregular soaring prices, threatening the livelihood of ordinary people, and the harm is not small. Yesterday, it issued another letter to all sectors, hoping to curb it quickly. The original text reads: "Since the outbreak of the European War, general merchants in Shanghai who deal in foreign goods believe that the time has come, and they have exaggerated their words and fabricated excessive rumors, pretending that the source of certain goods will be cut off, and then manipulated and hoarded the goods that were previously imported at low prices.</p>
<p>Manipulate the hoarding and raise the prices, and most people outside the industry also think of taking the opportunity to make profits. Regardless of the inventory of a certain commodity, how the sales volume is, and whether the source is intermittent or not, they lightly believe in the tricks of speculators and do not hesitate to purchase various goods at higher prices and hoard them in large quantities. The impact has caused the price of foreign goods to tend to rise irregularly, such as Western medicine, pigments, foreign needles, newspapers, etc., the selling price is</p>
<p>The price has risen from morning to evening without end, and compared with before the European War, it has risen by four or five times to more than ten times. As a result, speculators are indeed making several times the profit with the labor of a turnover, but most of the hard-working masses are feeling more and more difficult to live, because the profits of these small tricks are all obtained by exploiting the hard-working masses. As for the general people outside the industry</p>
<p>The result of hoarding goods is not only that there is no profit to be made, but also to give people the opportunity to make profits. According to the results of various investigations, goods from Europe and the United States, and even German goods, can still be transported to Shanghai by neutral countries as usual. As for the white paper, a large number of them have been shipped to Shanghai by Norwegian ships. Since the source of each cargo has not been cut off, the selling price will not rise again. Hoarding and speculating may</p>
<p>On the contrary, it may lead to losses, which are not taken by wise men. It is hoped that merchants from all walks of life will be conscientious. Do not deliberately raise the prices of old stocks and seize excessive profits. People outside the industry should not try to purchase goods and hoard them lightly. It is hoped that the leaders of each dish will guide and earnestly exhort them according to the situation, and jointly curb them, so that prices can return to normal and social harmony can be maintained together. Then thousands of hard-working people will feel great kindness and boundless sincerity. The Shanghai Thrift Movement Committee respectfully informs, hoping to learn and accept."</p>

<h3>Shanghai and Hong Kong Resume Chinese Telegrams</h3>
<p>Must Use Clear Code; Registered Mail Still Prohibited</p>

<h3>Ji Yunqing Assassinated and Died; Suddenly Attacked by Thugs on the Way Home After Leaving Office; Died of Old Age and Weakness</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3:50 p.m., a major shooting occurred on South Chengdu Road in the Public Concession. The victim was Ji Yunqing, a well-known figure in Shanghai. Although he was only shot once, he died less than half an hour after being sent to the hospital. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Has Lived in Shanghai for Many Years; Already Seventy-Two Years Old</p>
<p>Ji Yunqing was originally from Wuxi and has lived in Shanghai for many years. Although he is seventy-two years old, he is still full of energy. Ji built a large mansion in his original hometown of Wuxi at No. 2 Yuan Road in Xiyi. His Shanghai residence is at No. 2 Jinde Lane, South Chengdu Road. In peacetime, Ji often traveled between Shanghai and Wuxi, but since the outbreak of the war and the fall of Wuxi, Ji has been living in Shanghai all the time.</p>
<p>Got Out of the Car and Was Suddenly Attacked</p>
<p>Yesterday at 3:50 p.m., Ji returned to his residence after bathing at the Xiqingchi Bathhouse on Second Malu. Unexpectedly, just as he stepped out of the lane entrance of Jinde Lane and was getting out of his No. 1051 car, several thugs suddenly jumped out from the roadside and fired several shots at Ji without asking why. Ji was shot in the back of the head and collapsed on the ground. When his family members heard the alarm and came out to look, and the nearby patrolmen arrived, the murderers had already escaped without a trace.</p>
<p>Old Age and Weakness; Died Untreated</p>
<p>At this time, the police station also received a report from the patrolmen on duty in that section and immediately ordered a large number of detectives to rush to investigate and capture the murderers. At the same time, they urgently summoned an ambulance to send Ji to the Baolong Hospital on Baker Road for treatment. The doctor at the hospital immediately gave him emergency treatment in the operating room, but because Ji was old and weak, he was unable to be saved and died on the spot.</p>
<p>Many Friends; Many Students</p>
<p>His body was sent by the hospital to the coroner's office. After reporting to the court for examination, the body was sent to the World Funeral Home for burial. At the same time, because Ji had many friends and his students were also quite impressive, many people went to visit him after the accident. As for the reason for the murder, it is still under investigation, but according to general rumors, there have been many rumors about Ji recently, and there is some kind of attempt.</p>
<p>Leaves Behind Wife, Children, and Six Grandchildren</p>
<p>Ji's family members include his wife, children, and six grandchildren. His son, Shaoqing, is in his thirties and is married to a woman named Li. They have two sons (Ji's grandsons), named Shuifu and Quanfu. Ji's daughter is married to a man named Dong. Ji's wife, Lu, is also known as Jinbao Shiniang. When the Shanghai Concession Police Department opened a female detective division a few years ago, Jinbao Shiniang was the first to apply and was ranked as the first female detective. Therefore, people in the police force all know her.</p>
<p>Engaged in Business and Opened a Theater</p>
<p>As for Ji's life, in addition to engaging in business, he also opened a theater in Wuxi. His Wuxi residence has been burned down. Ji suffered from severe epilepsy a year ago and was cured after more than a year of careful treatment. He then made it a habit to bathe every day. When he had time, he often played mahjong with his students to pass the time. As for banquets and social events, he often declined unless they were very close friends.</p>
<h3>Peddler Couple Attacked and Injured; Murderers Entered the Room Late at Night</h3>
<p>Qin Peisheng, a 50-year-old Jiangbei native who lives in a bungalow without a number on Gordon Road and Haifang Road, is married to Wang, who is now 49 years old. Qin makes a living as a peddler, going out early and returning late. At 2:10 a.m. yesterday, Qin and his wife were fast asleep when two men, each armed with a sharp axe, broke into Qin's house and slashed at Qin and his wife several times before fleeing without a trace. Afterwards, the housemate reported it to the police, and the police arrested a suspect named Peng Dingru at dawn and took him to the police station for questioning. Qin and his wife were sent to the hospital for treatment. It is reported that their injuries are extremely serious and their lives are in danger.</p>

<h3>Testimony in the Morris Murder Case; Witness Testifies to the Case; Went to a Brothel Late at Night; Argument Because the Prostitute Was Already Asleep</h3>
<p>The *Shanghai Times* reported that Haines, the Recorder of the British Assessor's Court in China, yesterday (the 18th) heard the case of Morris (36 years old, British), a staff member of the Zhoushan Road Branch of the Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department, who was charged with manslaughter. Morris appeared in court to answer the charges. After the testimony of two Chinese eyewitnesses was recorded, the case was adjourned until Thursday morning at 10 a.m. for further hearing. The first eyewitness, Sheng Decun (transliteration), testified that the deceased was his uncle and opened a brothel at No. 688, Lane 74, Baker Road. He was hired by the deceased as a handyman. At 2:30 a.m. on the 9th of this month, he was copying accounts when he suddenly heard a knock on the door while the deceased was mopping the floor in the back room. At this point, Wright, the representative of the Municipal Council, asked the eyewitness if the house was a brothel. The eyewitness answered yes. Then he answered inquiries, saying that there were seven prostitutes in the house. The brothel owner knew that the knocker was a foreigner and refused to open the door first, saying that he heard the person outside the door</p>
<p>singing. After a while, a Chinese man who was traveling with the foreigner said that they were from the Municipal Council and asked him to open the door immediately. The deceased complied. After the Chinese man entered the house, he wanted to call a prostitute. The brothel owner said that the prostitutes were already asleep. The Chinese man insisted on calling one. The deceased finally called one downstairs. Halfway down the stairs, the Chinese man wanted to call several more women. The deceased said that they were all asleep. The Chinese man then slapped the deceased. When the eyewitness testified to this point, he was asked about the appearance of the foreigner. The eyewitness said that one of them was older than</p>
<p>the other one. The Chinese man knocked on the downstairs door, but there was no response. He spoke to the foreigner in a Western language. One of the foreigners grabbed the deceased's coat, he said. At this point, the eyewitness pointed to Morris as the older foreigner who grabbed the deceased's coat. He continued, saying that the foreigner dragged the deceased out the back door, and the Chinese man pushed him from behind. The younger foreigner did not do anything. The deceased was dragged to the lane. The eyewitness ran away to a small shop on Yangshupu Road because Morris said he was going to</p>
<p>return to the house to beat him. He returned after ten minutes and peeked into the lane and saw the foreigner and the Chinese man walking in the direction of Baker Road. When he entered the lane, he saw the brothel owner lying on the ground. He felt him and found that he was dead. The eyewitness quickly chased after the three men and grabbed the younger foreigner. The older foreigner told the eyewitness to go to the Municipal Council. At that time, a Japanese naval patrol team arrived and detained the foreigners and押 (yā)众 (zhòng)人 (rén)返 (fǎn)弄 (nòng)云 (yún), and brought everyone back to the lane, he said. At this point, the defendant's defender, Li Kesi, requested permission</p>
<p>for an adjournment for cross-examination. The testimony of the second eyewitness, Wang Xiuzhen (transliteration), a prostitute in the brothel, was consistent. Li Kesi also requested an adjournment for cross-examination. Recorder Haines adjourned the court and adjourned the case until Thursday morning at 10 a.m. for further hearing.</p>
<h3>Li Yongkuan Case: Civil Suit Opened Yesterday</h3>
<p>Li Yongkuan, Li Jiazhou, and Li Bihua, three bandits and salt smugglers from Anhui, formed a bandit team in Songjiang during the retreat of the National Army two years ago, setting fires, killing, robbing, and forcibly seizing two women, Lin Xiuhua and She Yuexian, and forcing them to marry Jiazhou and Bihua as wives. Jiazhou then shot and killed Lin's mother and buried her before escaping to Shanghai with the two women. Lin and She escaped and reported to the French police, who arrested Li and his sons and handed them over to the Second Special Court Criminal Division. They were prosecuted for crimes such as murder, robbery, deprivation of freedom, and rape. Lin and Yu also hired lawyer Xu Yannian to file an incidental civil suit, seeking compensation of 8,000 yuan each for lifelong solace and 500 yuan for Lin's mother's funeral expenses. The criminal part of this case has been judged. Li et al. were sentenced to severe sentences, all over ten years. The incidental civil suit was transferred to the civil court. The relevant information has been recorded in this newspaper. However, Li et al. did not accept the judgment and have appealed to the High Third Branch Court. The civil part has been transferred from the criminal court to the civil court for review. The case was heard yesterday morning by Judge Li Liang. The defendants, Li and his sons, were presented from the detention center. The plaintiffs, Lin and She, were represented by lawyer Xu Yannian, who recounted the robbery, forced marriage, and rape, and the killing of Lin's mother. The defendants' statements were the same as those previously given in the criminal court. They stated that Lin and She were married by local matchmakers such as Lu Baoren, and they did not recognize the compensation. The court reviewed the statements and ordered a postponement for further hearing. The three defendants were returned to the detention center.</p>

<p>The Datong University (Principal Wang Boqun) school building at No. 197 Qizhi Road is leased from the Sichuan Road China Business Company at a monthly rent of 1,200 yuan. Recently, the company suddenly commissioned lawyer Yang Linzhi to file a suit in the Civil Division of the Second Special District Court, requesting a judgment ordering Datong University to move out, and stated that the signed lease agreement was invalid as of September 30. The court approved the application. Yesterday, Judge Liao Yuan opened the Fourth Civil Division for trial. Datong University also commissioned a lawyer to appear in court and opposed the eviction. The court reviewed the statements and ordered the plaintiff to pay the litigation fees before a further hearing.</p>

The cart was in front, turning west at the Route Massenet intersection. The public bus tried to avoid it and drive ahead, but as the cart turned, the tips of the bamboo poles touched the front windshield of the bus, immediately shattering it. At the same time, all the glass windows from the front to the door of the bus were also shattered. Fortunately, the passengers and engine were unharmed. The police on duty brought both parties responsible for the accident to the police station for investigation.</p>

Madam Tang Jin asked to add two more, but Xu refused. Xu lost his temper and pushed Madam Tang Jin over, causing her to break her left foot. Passersby reported the incident to the police, who arrested Xu and sent him to the First Special Court for detention. At the continued hearing yesterday morning, the defendant also admitted to accidentally pushing Madam Tang Jin. The victim, Madam Tang Jin, also submitted a statement requesting that the defendant not be prosecuted, because she saw that he was pitiful, and if he were punished, his family's livelihood would be unsustainable.

<h3>Offered to Students Applying to the National Southwestern Associated University (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— (Sent from Kunming by Shen Jiaxian)</p>
<p>The unified examination is over, right? Students remaining in Shanghai, if you filled out the National Southwestern Associated University as a preference, here is some reference for you regarding the journey and the school's situation.</p>
<p>The National Southwestern Associated University was reorganized from the Changsha Temporary University, which was formed by the merger of Tsinghua University in Beiping, Peking University, and Nankai University in Tianjin. It is only a little over a year old, but because the reputations of the three schools support it, it has easily grown into a nursery for wartime youth. I believe that on the application forms of the students in Shanghai, three-quarters of them must have written it as their first choice. The National Southwestern Associated University currently has more than 5,000 students. In Kunming, a city less than a quarter the size of Shanghai, you can see their traces everywhere. — If you arrive in Kunming and don't know anyone, you can simply grab a student wearing a khaki uniform and ask them.</p>
<p>The highest authority of the National Southwestern Associated University is the Standing Committee. Previously, the presidents of the three schools, Zhang Boling, Jiang Menglin, and Mei Yiqi, served as standing committee members, deciding on the highest affairs of the school. Underneath, there are four departments: Academic Affairs, Student Affairs, General Affairs, and Registration, headed by Fan Chang, Bao Liangzhao, and Shen Fu Zhai, respectively. Further down, there are many committees — such as life guidance, library design, and scholarships. In terms of academics, there are five colleges: Liberal Arts, Science, Law, Commerce, Engineering, and Teacher Education, with departments such as Chinese Literature, Foreign Languages, Political Science, Economics, Commerce, Physics, Chemistry, Geology and Meteorology, Biology, Law, History and Sociology, Philosophy and Psychology, Education, Civic Education, Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Aviation, and Chemical Engineering.</p>
<p>In terms of facilities, there are three libraries. The Departments of Chinese Literature and Foreign Languages each have separate libraries. The College of Science has physics, chemistry, and biology laboratories, as well as a specialized journal reading room. The College of Engineering has carpentry, foundry, forging, and metalworking workshops, as well as laboratories for thermal engineering, AC and DC motors, radio, telephone and telegraph, hydraulics, and material strength. There is also an aircraft model room and a wind tunnel. In addition, Peking University and Tsinghua University have established liberal arts and science research institutes, as well as national conditions survey research institutes, aviation research institutes, and radio research institutes, to prepare graduates for advanced studies.</p>
<p>In terms of faculty, Peking University is famous for its liberal arts and science, Tsinghua for its science and engineering, and Nankai for its law and commerce. After the war, they came together, and no university in the country can surpass them. Therefore, in terms of faculty, it can be called the best in the country. Most of the students are from Hebei Province, followed by Jiangsu. Recently, the number of students from Jiangsu has gradually increased, and it is expected to rank first next semester. There are many small organizations within the school, such as singing groups, drama groups, wall newspapers, student associations, and hometown associations. When you come, you won't have to worry about being lonely and can feel right at home. It is said that the Ministry of Education will release the list of admissions in mid-September. I hope that all the admitted students can come to the mainland, so that we can add a lot of the joy of "meeting an old friend in a foreign land" to our welcoming banquet next semester. The school buildings are scattered in various districts. The Colleges of Liberal Arts, Science, Law, Commerce, and Teacher Education are originally at the Kunhua Agricultural School in the Great West Gate. Because the term is over, they will move into the newly built school buildings next semester. The College of Engineering is on Tuodong Road in the East Gate. The general office and female student dormitory are at the Kunhua Industrial School on Longxiang Street. The male student dormitory is at the Kunhua Normal School and the Kunhua Middle School on Wenlin Street. New students must go through the registration procedures as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Pay fees at the cashier's office (uniform compensation, tuition fee not charged)</p>
<p>(2) Physical examination at the physical education office</p>
<p>(3) Internal organ check at the school infirmary</p>
<p>(4) Receive admission card at the registration office (12 photos required)</p>
<p>(5) Receive room card at the dormitory affairs office (to be continued)</p>
<h3>Wang Xinming Left for Chongqing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Mi Jifang and Pan Tinggan Accompanied Him</p>
<p>Wang Xinming, the principal of Binhai Middle School on Nanyang Road, left Shanghai for Chongqing yesterday. He was accompanied by Mi Jifang, the former head of the First Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Pan Tinggan, the director of student affairs at Jiaotong University. Wang said to those who saw him off on the boat, "This trip has no mission. It is intended to cultivate personality because he deeply feels that his personal influence is extremely weak and needs more time to cultivate before it can be considered exemplary." As for his work in Shanghai, Principal Lu is in charge of the New China University, so there is absolutely no problem. The organizations of Binhai New and North schools are sound, so school affairs can naturally proceed as usual. He has also resigned from his position as a tutor and director at the College of Political Science and Law. As for other public organizations, he has not participated in them once since May of this year.</p>

<h3>金融 Rumors Resurface, Cash Retreats to the $4,000 Level, Afternoon Securities Dealers Suddenly Unload Actual Goods, Causing a Lowest Price of $3,890, Daily Trading Still Active at Approximately 3,000 Taels</h3>
<p>Yesterday, cash saw a sharp decline in the market, initially showing stability, hovering around $4,100. By afternoon, it plummeted, falling below the $3,900 level. The day's situation remained chaotic, with a difference of $250 between the high and low. Initially, the exchange rate was tight, causing gold prices to rise accordingly. The morning opening reached as high as $4,120. After the opening, the exchange rate suddenly eased, and despite Chongqing's efforts to affirm a peaceful atmosphere, rumors persisted in the market. Coupled with silver shops competing to sell, prices plummeted to $4,030. Later, due to strong absorption by Hong Kong dealers and the securities dealers also stepping in, coupled with a slight softening of the exchange rate, prices rebounded, reaching a peak of $4,140. Subsequently, as the exchange rate tended to ease again, operators such as securities dealers turned from buyers to sellers, falling back to $4,050. At noon, a certain money exchange firm re-entered the market, pulling prices up, closing at $4,080. The afternoon started very stable, once rising to $4,110. Shortly after, news of a significant easing of the exchange rate spread, and rumors intensified, leading to a weak market. Sellers followed suit, especially with securities dealers suddenly unloading 1,000 taels of actual goods. Buyers were cautious, mostly hesitant. Although a certain gold firm still absorbed some, it was ultimately difficult to counteract, and prices plummeted to a low of $3,890. The result was a closing price of $3,900, a further drop of $100 from the previous day. Before the peaceful atmosphere disappears, a rebound is unlikely. Daily trading remained active, at approximately 3,000 taels. Silver shop gold closed down $15, while customs gold remained unchanged.</p>

The opening price rose by $120, only a few dozen dollars higher than the previous day's closing price. A certain gold firm took in 20 taels from a money exchange firm at a price of $4,120. After the opening, retail sellers were very active, and silver shops also started selling, causing the market to soften.

Money exchange firms sold a total of 50 taels to fellow firms and a certain silver shop for $4,030. At that time, a certain money exchange firm's absorption became stronger, and securities dealers also started absorbing, leading to a rise of $70. The gold firm took in 20 taels from the money exchange firm for $4,100. Later, it was heard that the exchange rate had softened slightly again, and with securities dealers and gold firms continuing to absorb, prices rose another $40.

A certain money exchange firm took in 10 taels from the gold firm for $4,090. Subsequently, the silver shop sold 30 taels to another money exchange firm for $4,080, which served as the noon closing price.

At that time, a certain money exchange firm was quite absorbent, rising by $30. A group of securities dealers took in 10 taels from the silver shop for $4,110. Later, the peaceful atmosphere in the market suddenly became more intense, and the exchange rate also reported easing. In addition, many securities dealers closed out their long positions, and silver shops also followed suit, causing the market to decline, plummeting by $70. The silver shop sold 20 taels to the money exchange firm and 40 taels to a certain silver shop, both for $4,040. At that time, money exchange firms mutually traded 10 taels for $4,060. After that, due to the sharp easing of the exchange rate, prices fell another $110. The money exchange firm sold 10 taels to the silver shop for $3,950. At that time, a certain gold firm suddenly came in to absorb, pulling prices up by $30. A certain gold firm took in a total of 60 taels from the money exchange firm and the securities dealers for $3,980. Later, the gold firm stopped taking in and watched, and prices fell again, breaking below the $3,900 level. Securities dealers and money exchange firms sold a total of 40 taels to a certain money exchange firm for $3,890. After that, a certain gold firm revived its buying, absorbing more than 100 taels, and the decline stopped. The gold firm took in 30 taels from the securities dealers and 10 taels from the money exchange firm for $3,900, which served as the evening closing price.

<h3>Chinese Merchants More Eager to Sell Foreign Exchange, Although the U.S. Exchange Rate Listed Has Shrunk Again, the Process of the Black Market Continues to Show Sharp Easing</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market conditions were affected by the sharp drop of six points in the exchange rate of U.S. dollars against British pounds in overseas exchange, so the Shanghai HSBC U.S. exchange rate listed suddenly shrank by 125, creating an unprecedented tight price of five yuan and a half. The Dutch, French, and Japanese also shrank, while other currencies such as the British exchange rate remained flat. The domestic market opened in the morning, with the U.S. exchange rate tighter than the British exchange rate. The British gold was priced at 4 pence 03125, and the U.S. exchange rate was 6 yuan 375. After the opening, because the peaceful atmosphere of the previous day had not dissipated in the market, most buyers were cautious. In addition, Chinese merchants and Hong Kong telegraphs continued to sell to each other. Although the Japanese Bank and Sassoon absorbed the British gold, the foreign firms' appetite was not good, so the supply was ultimately greater than the demand. At noon, the British gold had hardened to 4 pence 1875, and the U.S. exchange rate had hardened to 6 yuan 6875. In the afternoon, because rumors of the above atmosphere became more intense, all speculators rushed to close out their positions. Chinese banks and Chinese merchants, yarn and flower dealers, etc., competed to sell fiercely, especially British gold. In addition, the amount of foreign firms' intake did not surge, so the situation was extremely relaxed. The cheapest British gold was 4 pence 375, and the U.S. exchange rate also hardened to 6 yuan 9275. The result was a closing price of 4 pence 34375 and 6 yuan 875, for a combined British and U.S. exchange rate of 3 yuan, 7 jiao, 9 fen, 8 li and a half, strong. The trend of this month's futures is still similar to that of spot goods. The trading volume was still strong throughout the day.</p>

The U.S. dollar shrank by six points against the British pound, one corner against Shanghai, and two points against France. The central listing prices for various currencies remained the same. The bank's morning opening spot selling price was 4 pence 03125 for British gold and 6 yuan 375 for the U.S. dollar, compared to the previous close, British tightened 046875, the U.S. softened 15625, and the U.S. was tighter than the British, which was due to the lower exchange rate between the U.S. and Britain. After the opening, because the peaceful atmosphere of the previous day was still intense, coupled with the fact that Hong Kong telegraphs and Chinese merchants all competed to sell, and the foreign firms' appetite was not good, the situation returned to tightening. It is estimated that Chinese merchants and Hong Kong telegraphs successively sold spot British gold to foreign firms, rising from 4 pence 09375 to 15625, and spot U.S. exchange rate from 6 yuan 46875, hardening to 5625. When the HSBC listing price was announced, British was flat and the U.S. shrank by 125, and the silver balance tax was announced, with a large increase of 2 points 75. After that, the Japanese Bank and the Western merchant Sassoon suddenly came to absorb British gold, causing the market to soften slightly. It is estimated that the Japanese Bank and Sassoon settled into HSBC, with favorable spot British gold at 4 pence 125 and 09375. At the same time, the foreign firms' selling price of the U.S. dollar also returned to 6 yuan and a half. Later, Chinese merchants revived the selling trend, and Hong Kong telegraphs and Hong Kong merchants also sold, so the potential trend became harder again. It is estimated that Hong Kong telegraphs and Chinese merchants successively sold spot British gold to Chinese banks, Youtai, and a certain U.S. bank for 4 pence 15625 and 1875, and spot U.S. exchange rate 6 yuan 615 and 6875.

<p>U.S. Dollar Approaching the 7 Yuan Level</p>
<p>In the later market, the peaceful atmosphere became more intense, and the general selling positions became more and more prosperous. Chinese banks, overseas Chinese, Shanghai, and Chinese merchants, yarn and flower dealers, etc., all competed to sell, mostly British gold, so the easing trend was more severe in British than in the U.S. It is estimated that Chinese banks and Chinese merchants sold spot British gold to foreign firms from 4 pence 28125 hardening to 375, and sold a small number of spot U.S. dollars to Datong and a certain bank from 6 yuan 6875, rising to 9375.

<h3>Foreign Currency Suddenly Drops After Rising</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market, initially because the foreign exchange bank tightly controlled the selling price, so the U.S. dollar bill reached as high as 15 yuan, 3 jiao and a half in the early morning. Due to the peaceful atmosphere still being rampant, it retreated to 14 yuan, 9 jiao near noon. In the afternoon, the saying became more popular, the exchange market eased greatly, and the gold price plummeted, and foreign currencies could not be an exception.

It only saw a rebound of $10 in the afternoon, and finally $95, a further drop of $17.5 from the previous day, because there were fewer and fewer people buying foreign exchange and cash, resulting in a surplus of banknotes. The Money Industry Association's interbank interest rate remained at 2 jiao in both the morning and afternoon markets, and was not changed.</p>
<h3>British and American Gold Prices Continue to Rise Unabated</h3>
<p>London, 18th telegram, the silver market saw some short covering, with little supply, and the market was firm. After the closing, it turned flat.

<h3>Interbank Exchange Drafts, Final Withdrawal of Legal Tender</h3>
<p>The city's two associations of silver and money industries, in order to regulate the interbank sale of gold, agreed with the Bank of China, Central Bank, and Bank of Communications to convert all the exchange deposit principal and interest of the bank's and money house's end-of-June deposit reserve to the bank and the money industry reserve fund into legal tender at 95% off, and withdraw it in twelve weeks on average. Since July 4th, Tuesday is the date of withdrawal every week, which has been detailed in this newspaper.

From then on, the interbank exchange transfer to legal tender ended. It is found that since July 4th, the market has increased the amount of cash by more than 20 million yuan, and the exchange premium has therefore decreased day by day, and yesterday it has fallen to less than 100 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Flowers, Speculators Uneasy, Yarn Market Declines Rapidly, Double Horse and Heavenly Maiden Each Fall 40 Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market, which had been rising for a week, suddenly plummeted yesterday, probably because it was rumored that the Sino-Japanese peaceful atmosphere was strong, and the sales were not smooth, the people's hearts were very weak, and the speculators showed an uneasy appearance. A part of them closed out the positions at the market price, and the market quickly declined. The spot price of 20-count Double Horse fell into the 800 yuan level, and Heavenly Maiden broke through the 700 yuan level. Afterwards, merchants with sufficient strength came back to buy cheap goods and take them in, and the price rose again. The Double Horse returned to the edge of 800 yuan. Judging from the current trend, there may be a temporary rotation, waiting for the development of actual needs, and then showing a new posture.</p>
<p>Because the market sentiment was good on the previous day, the morning opening price of the current yarn was 830 yuan for the 20-count Change Horse, which did not move. Double Earth was 780 yuan, a rise of 10 yuan. Shortly after, the sound of selling was revived in the market, and the situation was turbulent. The market gradually fell, the Double Horse fell to 770 yuan, and the stack order fell to 720 yuan. Soon, the new bulls came to activity at low prices, and the market price slowly recovered. The statistics for half a day showed that 900 bales were traded, the price of 20-count Double Horse fell 37 yuan, Shepherd fell 5 yuan, Heavenly Maiden fell 40 yuan, and Double Earth fell 25 yuan.

<h3>New Cotton Arrivals are Increasingly Prosperous, Market Prices Fall Back Four or Five Yuan, Overseas Cotton Markets are also Weak</h3>
<p>The trading of current cotton is still not weak, but the market price has slightly fallen back, with a drop of four or five yuan. The overseas cotton market is weak, and the Indian cotton forecast is to fall by more than ten rupees. As the local new cotton is being launched on the market, the source of Tongzhou flowers is unobstructed and is becoming more and more enthusiastic, resulting in softening of the people's hearts and loosening of the selling price. As for the factory, in view of the crowded arrivals, the intention to process has turned淡. The source of northern Jiangsu has about 5,000 bales of Tongzhou flowers arriving, and 480 pieces of Beisha are coming. The current cotton sales prices are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Another message, the Shanghai foreign cotton market, there were various rumors in the market yesterday, so the colleagues were deeply afraid that there would be a major change in the market, so they all planned to temporarily hold a wait-and-see attitude, and the trading suddenly turned quiet. The parties are convinced that this is temporary. Once the verification of this rumor is unfounded, the price of cotton will be able to restore its old view.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton market price, the New York cotton market, is very quiet, because it is the autumn harvest, and the southern cotton farmers are fiercely selling in the New York cotton market every time the price is high. The sales in the market have been quite intense recently, so the cotton market is difficult to revitalize, and overseas cotton merchants are selling in the market, and the price has fallen by more than ten pounds yesterday. The Indian has dropped thirteen rupees, including the forecast, Egypt has dropped more than twenty pounds, and Liverpool has dropped more than twenty pounds.</p>
<h3>Securities, Domestic Debt Surges, Class C Rushes Out to Forty-Four Yuan, Overseas Stock Market is Stable and Firm</h3>
<p>The securities black market, bought and sold as usual yesterday, the popularity suddenly turned firm and rose. Before the market closed the day before, the transactions of various individuals had secretly tended to be very strong.

Rumors spread like bees in the market, although they have not been formally confirmed, they have been enough to arouse the interest of the general public. The so-called peaceful atmosphere has been loud, and the decline in the price of various commodities, the loosening of foreign exchange and gold, and the excitement of the people. Yesterday's experience, the opening price was similar to the market price made in the dark yesterday, and the buying and selling was also idle. Most of them were watching, and the market price fluctuated very little. When the market opened in the afternoon, rumors suddenly arose, and various legends, although they were all captured, could not be confirmed. At the same time, because the exchange rate continued to rise, gold, cotton yarn, etc. all saw a big drop, and it seemed that there was a considerable cause and effect, so the inside of the market suddenly became lively. Although there were still sellers, the buyers were still enthusiastic, such as Mao Tai, Yong Kang, Lianyi and No. 25 and others continued to buy, the market price rose, and gradually became stronger. Class C rushed out of the forty-four yuan level, and after the close of the market, the price of forty-five yuan, five jiao, and six jiao was seen. The enthusiasm of the people can be seen here. The closing price has risen by one yuan, four jiao, and five jiao compared with last Saturday, and the total number of transactions is estimated to be one million, five hundred and sixty thousand yuan.

<p>The Zhongye Public Institute reported that the stock market was stable and firm yesterday. Although the price was slightly soft when the market opened, the trend gradually moved upward. The Jardine Matheson stock was once raised to a high price of thirty-six yuan, and it seems that the general public imagines that the announcement of this good dividend is already in sight. At the close of the market, there were buyers at thirty-four yuan, seven jiao and a half, and the seller demanded thirty-five yuan.</p>

<h3>Grain, Japonica Rice Unchanged, Kesian Rice Elevated by Two or Three Jiao</h3>
<p>Dumai, there is no arrival under the river, wheel buns, and more than 6,000 bags of goods from Lai Kunxing and other districts. Although the arrival of goods is not rare, the people are not willing to easily sell out, so the sales market on this street is ordinary, and the prices of various goods are still standing at the original price, and if the new tip of the river is less, the high one can add half a yuan, and the Wuxi rice is still forty yuan, the high thirty-seven or eight yuan, the middle thirty-six yuan, and the Su Tongkun rice is thirty-six yuan or thirty-five yuan.

<p>Kesian, the market was also weak yesterday morning. Soon, the arrivals in the Jiangbei area have been reduced, and the buyers have low prices and low needs, and the village and rice shops in the mainland have picked up high absorption, and the market has gradually improved. The selling price in the afternoon market has been raised by two or three jiao, and the sellers have been more firm in the afternoon. Yesterday, more than 4,000 bags were traded, Jiangbei fragrant high twenty-six yuan, five or six jiao, Wu fragrant around twenty-six yuan, and the middle and secondary ones are twenty-five or six yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour is secretly loose, and the wheat reserve is increasing day by day</h3>
<p>The flour market is clearly stable and secretly loose. Although the No. 2 flour factory's market is standing at the original price of seven yuan and two jiao, the return goods have gradually become loose and tired. Because of the sharp drop in the gold market, the sharp drop in rice prices, and the impact of Japanese flour dumping, the people are not weak. Both the North and South passenger sales are rare to open, and they all think about choosing cleverly and taking. Therefore, the market is invisibly loose, and the return goods are looser than before. The price of the warship spleen is seven yuan, a jiao six or seven points, and the price of the fort car brand is only seven yuan and a jiao. The number of transactions is only more than 10,000 bags, and the zero batch transactions on this street are only six or seven thousand bags. The foreign flour has been paid attention to by the Nanyang gang recently, and the foreign sources have been blocked, and the selling price still needs seven yuan, seven or eight jiao. On the 20th, 37,500 bags of flour were exported to Tianjin, 6,130 bags were exported to Xiamen, and 1,750 bags were exported to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The trend of the wheat market is also fresh to revitalize. The source of various places has been connected in recent days, and the actual sales are flat. The accumulation has become more and more abundant. The holders' intentions have shaken, and they are all willing to sell as the market demands, and the purchasers take this opportunity to suppress the price, causing the market to gradually fall. The two sides of the factory stock are both unable to hold each other, and only the Japanese flour factory has secretly purchased four or five cars, and the price has fallen one or two jiao from before.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains, New Sesame Continues to Arrive, Selling Prices Rise Two or Three Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's situation in the miscellaneous grains market did not have special changes due to the market closure on the previous day (Monday), but the market price was still in a firm situation. Broad beans have the North Ocean Gang's destination to relay, so the price has risen by two or three jiao. The yellow bean market is also firm and stable. The new sesame seeds continue to arrive in Shanghai, and the products of this Geng are still good, and the harvest is slightly poor. It is estimated that eight bags of Guan Dian snow sesame seeds will be transported, and the price will be thirty yuan. Six bags of Danyang white sesame seeds will be opened, and the price will be twenty-seven yuan, three jiao (including the broker's commission), and fifty bags of Yangzhou white sesame seeds will be opened, and the price will be twenty-seven yuan. The market price has risen by two or three yuan from before, because the middle has lacked arrivals. Also, today there are 1,400 bags of bean curd that will be transported to Tianjin, and 480 bags will be transported to Xiamen, and 750 bags will be transported to Hong Kong.</p>

<h3>North and South Goods, Pagoda Tree Rice is Stored and Purchased to Revitalize</h3>
<p>Pagoda tree rice was once short, and there was a wild market of more than sixty yuan, so the high price attracted distant customers, and the source became prosperous, and the price fell miserably. The average is only sold for twenty-one or two yuan, and the ground price has increased, so the stored households are very concerned. Therefore, they are starting to purchase, and the market has been revitalized. The average has risen to twenty-six or seven yuan, and the high goods are called thirty-one yuan.</p>

<p>The Company Allocates 30,000 in Special Reserve as a Fund; The Price-Controlled Rice Method Has Six Aspects for Reference by All Sectors</p>
<p>Recently, prices in "Isolated Island" have soared, especially the price of rice, which has risen to around forty yuan per shi (unit of dry measure), further increasing the hardship of salaried employees. As a result, employees in various industries have requested subsidies and relief from their employers. There are not a few employers who are able to sympathize with the lives of their employees and implement the issuance of subsidies. However, some issue rice subsidies, while others increase salaries by a few percent, ranging from several yuan to several tens of yuan, with varying amounts and many advantages and disadvantages to the methods.</p>
<p>Last month, the business staff raised a request for rice subsidies with the management. After many twists and turns, the management recently decided on a method for price-controlled rice sales to employees, which will be implemented from September. The details are introduced as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The company will allocate 30,000 yuan from the "Type B Special Reserve" fund (originally for public welfare) as a fund for price-controlled rice sales to all colleagues in Shanghai. When this fund is depleted to the point where it is insufficient to price-control an adequate amount of rice, the company will consider adding more funds.</p>
<p>(2) All colleagues in Shanghai with a monthly salary of less than 100 yuan are eligible to enjoy the benefits of price-controlled rice sales.</p>
<p>(3) Those who enjoy the benefits of price-controlled rice sales are limited to a maximum of 80 jin (unit of weight) per month, and are graded according to their needs as follows: (A) Student female workers (widowed female workers who have parents-in-law and children to support will be treated the same as male workers) and male workers who are alone in Shanghai will each be able to purchase 20 jin of price-controlled rice per month (equivalent to one dou (unit of dry measure) and two and a half sheng (unit of dry measure)). (B) Male workers whose wives, children, or dependent direct ascendants live with them in Shanghai will be able to purchase 40 jin of price-controlled rice per month; those with two people living with them in Shanghai will be able to purchase 50 jin; those with three people living with them in Shanghai will be able to purchase 60 jin; those with four people living with them in Shanghai will be able to purchase 70 jin; those with five people living with them in Shanghai (if there are more than two children or dependent direct ascendants, they will still be counted as two people) will be able to purchase 80 jin (equivalent to five dou).</p>
<p>(4) The price-controlled price will be 15 yuan per shi when the rice price is within 40 yuan. If the rice price exceeds 40 yuan, the price sold to colleagues will be the sum of the excess and 15 yuan. For example, if the rice price is 41 yuan per shi, the price sold to colleagues should be calculated at 16 yuan per shi. When the rice price falls back to below 15 yuan, the price-controlled method will be cancelled.</p>
<p>(5) The average market price of No. 2 Japonica rice from the 1st to the 10th of each month will be used as the standard, but if the average exceeds 40 yuan, it will still be calculated as 40 yuan.</p>
<p>(6) The company will calculate the amount of rice subsidized by the company based on the amount of rice that each level of colleagues can purchase as stipulated in Article 3, and then calculate the subsidized rice price according to the standard in Article 5. This will be noted on the "Price-Controlled Rice Coupon," which will be distributed on the 15th of each month. Colleagues can use this coupon to purchase rice at the calculated rice price from the rice shop designated by the company. After receiving the coupon, the rice shop can send a letter to the company to collect the money.</p>
<p>Although this price-controlled method does not completely alleviate the difficulties of our employees' lives, it is still a relatively fair and reasonable rice subsidy method, so I am introducing it based on the facts, so that the authorities of various industries can use it as a reference for improving the lives of their employees.</p>
<h3>The Voice of Women</h3>
<p>— Shen Shiguang</p>
<p>It was on September 10th that I saw a notice on the newspaper that said "The Postal Administration is Recruiting Junior Postal Workers on Behalf of the Mainland." At that time, I was so happy that I jumped up, because according to the usual rules, postal workers were recruited from women. Now that I meet all the requirements, and going to the mainland has always been my wish, isn't this a great opportunity? So, the next morning, I ran from Zhaofeng Garden in the far west to the General Post Office on North Sichuan Road in the far north, with a heart full of enthusiasm and hope, and stepped onto the business department on the second floor. I stopped at window number ten:</p>
<p>"Sir, please give me an application form."</p>
<p>"Ha! The General Office just called and said that we are not accepting female employees this time."</p>
<p>This ban made me come with a heart full of enthusiasm, but return with a shattered heart. I don't know if I should be angry or sad at that time. Because of the economy, I couldn't go to university; it is difficult to find a job in Shanghai, and going to the mainland requires slowly waiting for an opportunity. Now I thought the best opportunity had come, but who knew that this only hope would be shattered without a trace? This sadness is truly unbearable!</p>
<p>I heard that the reason for not accepting women is because "women are physically weak and cannot endure the pain of traveling far." This kind of consideration is somewhat pedantic. Are girls born in the 20th century still so weak? I dare to apply, don't I know my own physical condition? Of course, most modern ladies are unwilling to go to the mainland to suffer, but for women like us who are willing to serve in the mainland, I am confident that my body is not much worse than that of a man! If you compare the women of the Northwest with the young masters of Shanghai, I think the latter would truly be ashamed of themselves, right? I hope that everyone will not only keep the old mentality. The giant wheel of the times is moving forward, and humanity is also evolving. Women are not always and forever boudoir ladies who cannot travel far! I hope the authorities can think twice before acting.</p>
<p>In this era of the 20th century, when gender equality and women's economic independence are being sung to the clouds, women are still being rejected everywhere they go to find employment. I don't know what this means? Married women are already rejected, and unmarried women are also facing misfortune. I really don't know if women should always and forever die.</p>
<p>Men often ridicule women for not being able to be economically independent, but looking at the current situation, is it that we are voluntarily not independent, or is it caused by the social environment?</p>
<p>Finally, I want to tell everyone that the number of men and women who are continuing to go to the mainland to study is almost equal. Please don't think that the women's department cannot endure the pain of traveling far.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that my female compatriots will all exert their strength to strive for our rights and our careers!</p>
<h3>After the Rain, a Clear Sky</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 16: Planning to Establish Medical Education and Talent Cultivation, Thinking About Expanding Rural Governance and Providing Care for Children</p>
<p>In addition, the imperfections in sanitation are all too visible, and it is difficult to describe them all. Old Doctor Zhang asked around in various places, and she only chose remote places to see, and felt that the people in some places were really suffering. But now they are gradually thinking about improving, if it were in the past, it would be like hell. However, improving sanitation and everything else requires considerable talent. Before the war, China was confused and did not know how to cultivate talent. Also, because talent could not be matched with the cause, there was often very good talent that could not be used by the world. Even to the point where many people, for the sake of living, had to use what they had not learned and had to change careers. Now, with normal careers matched with proper talent, one feels a lack. Old Doctor Zhang thought that in order to develop the sanitation cause in the mainland, one must quickly cultivate sanitation talent. She used to be like the isolationists in the United States, only guarding her own post, and not asking about anything else. What was her own post? It was running this Women and Children's Hospital well. At that time, the Women and Children's Hospital was very small, and even had no nursery. Even Chang'er, who sent Zhu Airen to study in the United States, was still guarding her post. She wanted to run the obstetrics and pediatrics departments well, and the starting point was still in medicine. But later, the nursery was run very smoothly, and it was famous at home and abroad. And there was that story of triplets, a rare anecdote that aroused people's interest. Donations were automatically sent by people, which exceeded the scope of just obstetrics and pediatrics medicine, and made the people who ran it even more interested. But because this place's reputation rose, many people asked Old Doctor Zhang for talent. Not only their church, but also those who preached in the mainland, ran charities, and established hospitals, asked her for talent. Even the Health Committee established by the government asked her for talent. Therefore, Old Doctor Zhang's post, which she had always stood on, expanded a little, and she also wanted to cultivate more talent. Since she went to the Chinese mainland for a tour, she felt even more that there was a lack of talent everywhere, and that there was a need for talent, and that more talent had to be cultivated. How to cultivate talent? It was necessary to establish a medical school. With China's place as big as it is, and the people as numerous as they are, establishing a medical school is like a drop in the bucket, it is useless. However, having one more medical school is always better than cultivating some talent, and cultivating some talent to respond to the requests from all parties is also good. Because medical schools often need a place for practice, and this place has a Women and Children's Hospital that can be used for practice after all. Old Doctor Zhang has had this wish for more than a year since she traveled in the Chinese mainland. (183)</p>
<h3>Special Feature on a Certain Foreign Firm</h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>A Miniature of the Shanghai Foreign Goods Market</p>
<p>It was Saturday morning, just at half past eight, and the comprador's room of a certain foreign firm was already very lively. A mixture of conversations and a strong smell of cigarettes filled this quiet comprador's room.</p>
<p>The sound of the bell, Dangdang..., broke the tense atmosphere, and unceremoniously rang nine times in a row.</p>
<p>"Why hasn't the comprador Mr. arrived yet? Yesterday he promised to sell me thirty pieces of kraft paper, the selling price was set at six jiao (unit of currency) per pound in silver dollars, but according to last night's buying price, it has already risen to seven jiao per pound. If he doesn't come in a while, I'm afraid he will overturn the previous agreement!" Mr. Wang, who was sitting alone in the west corner, seemed a little disappointed as he waited.</p>
<p>"Isn't that right? The day before yesterday morning, I bought five hundred reams of newsprint from him, the price was set at seventeen yuan and five jiao per ream, but when I sent the money to pick up the goods in the afternoon, the market price had already risen to nineteen yuan per ream. Therefore, the transaction was almost broken. Fortunately, Mr. Zhao was willing to mediate, and the transaction was completed at a price of eighteen yuan per ream. It is really difficult to buy popular goods now, you are fighting and snatching, and the selling price in the market is different in the morning and evening. There is a risk of price changes in the blink of an eye, how can we be separated by this long night, I am afraid that the agreed price has become nonsense!" Mr. Li continued Mr. Wang's conversation.</p>
<p>"I heard that the foreign fixed price has also risen by 20%, and the goods cannot be delivered for the time being in the next two or three months, so the negotiated price in the guild yesterday was also extremely chaotic because of this. The five pieces of lightweight kraft paper that Xiao Lu received the day before yesterday were sold yesterday afternoon, earning more than 300 yuan. It is said that Mr. Mao alone hoarded more than 50,000 yuan of newsprint a month ago. According to yesterday's market price, he has already made more than 70,000 yuan in unexpected gains. Who wouldn't be jealous of that? So I also came to collect as much as possible. As long as there is an opportunity, all the expenses for the second half of this year can be covered by this "beginning"!" A Wu said excitedly.</p>
<p>"The comprador Mr. is here!" Just this light sentence interrupted their conversation, and in an instant it was completely silent.</p>
<p>A fat comprador Mr. had just stepped into the door of the comprador's room, and had already been surrounded by many buyers. What followed was the negotiation of prices, looking at samples, and doing the necessary procedures for buying and selling.</p>
<p>Although the selling price is constantly rising, there are still many buyers who will try their best to collect as much as possible. As long as there are stocks for sale, the buyers will not have the slightest complaint about the selling price being slightly more expensive. Because they all have a mysterious hope, how to rely on this stock to make a big profit!</p>
<p>Therefore, in a small writing room like a bucket, they are just busy punching stacks, issuing invoices, collecting money, resolving banks, and settling drafts, and they are busy together.</p>
<p>The clock is constantly moving forward, and the buyers in the comprador's room are also changing in batches. Some are hoarding in large quantities, and some are buying in small numbers. The chaotic situation in these three hours is also a miniature of the Shanghai foreign goods market.</p>

<h3>Can the Script Be Ignored in Acting?</h3>
<p>— Zhang Guyu</p>
<p>Drama is social education. To teach students, one must examine and approve the textbook. To persuade the masses, can the script be ignored? In the middle of the Qing Dynasty, the people's spirit was strong, and the people's hearts were simple and straightforward. Everything was valued for its righteousness, and prejudice was considered despicable. Watching dramas was all about thinking from the positive side. It was not as decadent as the people's spirit is today, and the people's hearts are treacherous and cunning, abandoning the right path and not following it. Therefore, Hong Ni Guan and Battle of Wancheng were considered plays that advised women not to have delusional thoughts in the early years. Today, people do not pay attention to the result, but instead focus on thinking about spring. Persuading good has become teaching lewdness. Playing the Dragon Robe and Touring the Six Halls were thought by the ancients to be able to encourage filial piety, but today people see them as promoting superstition. Seeing Ma Yi in The Ninth Watch and Yue Fei in The Pavilion of the Windy Waves, old people mostly respect their loyalty, and at the same time think of the abominable and hateful nature of Hou Huazui and Zhang Bangchang. Today, people not only do not think of the poisonous treachery of Hou and Zhang, but instead say that Ma is forbearing and Yue is stupid. On the surface, the Seven Star Temple seems to be unremarkable, but in fact it is secretly warning young men and women not to engage in illicit stories in the outside world. It is said that the Yang family had no results later, which was the retribution for the illicit affairs in the Seven Star Temple. Today, most young men and women hold the concept of enjoying the moment. The word "future" seems to be unnecessary to talk about.</p>
<p>The Scholar's Handbook writes about Chen Zhi's loveliness on the one hand and Zhu Cang's abominableness on the other. From this, it is telling us that the ancients were so poor that they became beggars, but they still did not forget their ancestors. Taking Gao Deng is to state that the son of a treacherous official fishes and meats the people, and in the end he is killed by others. It can also make people today know that the ancients were willing to help the righteous and save the endangered. Going to Tiantai Mountain is to record the monarch's indulgence in female lust and his failure to handle important matters. Luanzhou writes about a military general who died loyally and was respected by the enemy instead. Why did the Shepherd's Scroll have Xi Peng recognize his wife? And why did it write about Xi Peng recognizing his mother? Because Zhu's mother did not die, it was due to the merit of his daughter-in-law, Zhao. Not recognizing his mother but rewriting recognizing his wife is to encourage future generations. The White Silk Record is a warning to students not to set foot in flower bushes. Picking the Slide Car is an implication that young people should never act too hastily. And so on and so forth. It is a pity that the actors today only seek to meet the welcome of the audience, and the audience only wants the actors to give them good looks and good sounds. Acting and watching plays are just like that. Who cares about the responsibility? Who explores the meaning? People's hearts and customs are different from the past. How can the plays performed be based on previous examples?</p>
<p>Choosing a script is the most important issue at present. Plays that teach lewdness and theft should be fundamentally prohibited. Plays that are mediocre and do not conform to the trend should also be banned. In short, all the plays performed are conscious, purposeful, and suitable for the trend and environment. The performers perform in the same way, and the audience is unconsciously influenced. Then, singing plays is not without purpose, and watching plays is beneficial.</p>
<h3>Random Memories of Chrysanthemums (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Xiao Cang</p>
<p>Before the tenth year of the Republic of China, there was a female actress named He Shunqin in the old capital. She had sung on the same stage with Li Guifen, Fu Zhifang, Shuang Lanying, and others. At that time, Shunqin's magic power was quite strong. Shunqin was originally a famous prostitute in the capital. Her posture was extremely beautiful. When she dressed up and went on stage, her style was excellent. The beauty of her entire body was all in her eyes. Ordinary people were all fascinated by her. She liked to make friends with martial arts students. She had relationships with Yang Xiaolou, Shen Huaxuan, Yu Zhenting, Jiuzhenfeng, Zhou Ruian, Liu Yanfang, and others. Xiaolou and Yanfang were like father-in-law and son-in-law, and Shunqin was able to combine the two, which was also an interesting story in the Peking opera world. Shunqin usually entered the various theaters in colorful makeup. When the martial arts students came on stage, she would stare intently, and her licentious intentions were all in her eyebrows. Even though thousands of people were watching, she did not care at all. When the song ended, she would suddenly disappear. Whenever a new martial arts student arrived, she would definitely strive to get acquainted first. The drunkard's intention was not really about the wine. In a certain year, Gai Jiaotian went north to perform, and Shunqin saw that his skills were strong and healthy, and liked him. She pursued him by all means, and finally entered the snare. Shunqin rented a small house on Cherry Diagonal Street, and lived with him for several months, inseparable, as if they were a loving couple. It happened that Gai's father met Chen Leqing, a prostitute in the north. Chen was a famous prostitute, and Shunqin fought with her, leading to a break. Shunqin then hunted Zhou Ruian to soothe her loneliness. Yang Xiaolou also had a vinegar wave with Yanfang because of Shunqin. After mediation by insiders, the two of them would meet in boots—meeting in boots meant that two people would go to the same prostitute, and meet in her boudoir. The two people's private suspicion was released. There was also one thing that was really ridiculous. Shunqin and a certain martial arts student (some said Kang Xishou, some said Shen Huaxuan) were traveling in the New World of the old capital. The two of them suddenly engaged in obscene acts in a telephone booth. The matter was reported by tourists, and the police rushed to arrest the two of them and take them to the official office. They were fined and detained for several days before the matter was settled. Her scandalous secrets were mostly like this. In the autumn of the eighth year of the Republic of China, I once listened to her singing the song "Relieving Jade Hall Spring" with Mr. Hu Pingzhai in Zhonghe Garden. Hu listened to Shunqin's songs for several days, and his intention was also to hunt Shunqin and want to get her to be satisfied. She was not bad in both singing and body movements, and her color was even more moving, but her white mouth expressions were not as good as those of insiders. Later, a certain Cantonese official loved her, and booked a seat and supported her every day. After the play, they would ride in a car together and leave, and passers-by would watch them off. Those who supported her would all shout good, and their ugly attitude was completely exposed. After the tenth year of the Republic of China, she disappeared from the singing stage.</p>
<h3>Unofficial Records of the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>The Story of Wang Keqin's Separation and Reunion with Zhang Xun</p>
<p>One day, my late friend Lin Wushan and I went to Tian Taishan Nong's book selling place on Beile Road in the French Concession. That day was the birthday of his female disciple, Ms. Keqin. At that time, very exquisite delicacies were prepared, all made by the female soil. Another couch was set up, with a small jar of high-quality opium placed on it. After the meal, Keqin also burned cigarettes for Wu Changshuo and Shannong. Her skills were extremely exquisite. The lady's conversation was elegant and interesting. In her words, she deeply hated Zhang's vulgarity and immorality. She said, "One day, when it was very hot, Zhang's first wife kept shouting that she was thirsty. There was no place to get a melon at night. Zhang was at that time naked, with bare arms and feet. He secretly put the old skin on his feet and the greasy ash on his arms into the pot, and said to his first wife, 'This is a famous mountain scented tea specially given by a certain governor. Drink a cup, and I guarantee you won't shout that you're thirsty again.' The first wife just drank a cup, and Zhang immediately clapped his hands and laughed, running around and almost falling to the ground. The first wife knew that there was nothing good, and quickly chased after him, asking what he had put in it. When he explained, the first wife immediately vomited and chased after him, cursing, 'What a old fart, you old boy, you really hurt me.' Zhang laughed even more when he heard this, tears streaming down his face. It is estimated that Old Zhang did a lot of this kind of prank, but except for the first wife, we all didn't curse him. Even if sometimes he couldn't help but scold me for fun, I would always put on a serious face and ignore him, and later he would just let it go. Otherwise, he would act unreasonably and be shameless and refuse to pay, so those adjutants and commanders under him always called him Win to please him and make him happy. (104)</p>
<p>Random Notes on Artists</p>
<h3>Young Musician Chen Gexin (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Tianma</p>
<p>— Answering Questions from Guests for Entering the New Capital</p>
<p>Yesterday, the reporter visited Chen Jun and listened to his classical music. By the way, he asked him about his thoughts after entering "Xindu". His answer was:</p>
<p>It is already a great fortune for art if those who do not respect art can avoid forcefully destroying it. The "Xindu" authorities quite want to innovate the "vulgarization" of broadcasting programs. I introduced some works with artistic value, and I cooperated with "Xindu" in this way.</p>
<p>In terms of content, we have instrumental music, vocal music, and dance. Most of the instrumental music is an introduction to simple and popular Western works. Vocal music and dance are mostly some translated songs of domestic works. Nineteen of the dances are sketches. If the equipment is advanced, the promotion of "New Songs and Dances" can be very smooth.</p>
<p>Those who have become degenerate and prostituted have complained: "Chen Gexin is getting more and more degenerate with songs and dances." I will not pay attention to this kind of malicious attack. I will only introduce new songs and dances to the public and never collude with others.</p>
<p>In short, he is a person who claims to protect Classic Msnic "classical" music, and his performance at the Xindu Hotel is "classical" music, because he is a "classical supreme" young musician.</p>
<h3>Bai Yang Recovers from Illness</h3>
<p>— Hui</p>
<p>(Chongqing Correspondence) Bai Yang and Gao Zhanfei, who live in Xindu, could not help but be moved when they received the two thousand yuan travel expenses remitted by the Xinhua Company in Shanghai, and planned to set off for Shanghai immediately. However, later, because of the direct dissuasion from local friends and the ridicule behind their backs, their trip to Shanghai was temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>When they were still hesitating about returning to Shanghai, Bai Yang suddenly fell ill due to excessive physical exhaustion and excessive losses from previous illegal production. Fortunately, he stayed at Renji Hospital on the South Bank. After more than two weeks of recuperation, he finally recovered from his illness. Now he has fully recovered to health.</p>
<p>Just after Bai Yang recovered from his illness, the "China Electric" authorities started filming again because a large number of negatives had been transported. Bai Yang only has a "Long Sky Ten Thousand Miles" co-starring with Gao Zhanfei, besides the filming of "Children of China".</p>
<p>The film has been going on for more than a year since it started last year. Most of it has been completed, and there is still a small part of the location. The work has been repeatedly suspended and delayed due to air raids and film problems. It was not until recently that it continued to be filmed.</p>
<p>On the 7th of this month, the director of the film, Sun Yu, specially borrowed several pieces of air combat equipment from the Mechanical Department of ×× Department, and immediately took all the staff to Chengdu to shoot the location. It is decided that Gao and Bai will live together in the Sullivan Hotel in Chengdu. It is said that after filming the location in Chengdu, they will also go to Kunming to take the location.</p>
<p>Judging from this situation, their current work is becoming more and more tense. The so-called return to Shanghai, even if it is realized, will have to be after the film is finished, and it is estimated that the completion date of the film will still be several months later!</p>
