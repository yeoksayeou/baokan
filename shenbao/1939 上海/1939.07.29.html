<p>（華盛頓）美國廢止美日商約之行動、已使美國對於遠東之地位、加以明確之規定、此後美日關係之如何變化、完全視日本之態度及其在遠東之行動為轉移、政府方面與外交界方面預料日本或將採取某種經濟報復手段、假若日本眞出於報復之一途、則美國更有熟籌已久之計劃、以回擊日本、以一雪美國權益及在華美人屢遭蔑視之恥辱、（二十八日美聯電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美日兩國通商航海條的宣告廢止之後、赫爾國務卿頃發表談話云、國務院將密切注視遠東時局、至明年一月杪此的滿期之時為止、以便參酌情形、決定辦法、記者數人叩以美國政府是吾擬與日本開始談判、締結新商的、據答稱、國務院當在六個月內出以靜觀態度、又有記者叩詢美駐日代辦杜曼與日外務省美國局局長芳澤談話情形、據答稱、並無何項結果云、（二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美財長摩根索今日聲稱、國務院昨旣宣告廢止美日商的、財部當將購買日本金銀間題及增加日本棉布進口稅問題、重新考慮、以期抵制日政府所給予之出口津貼云、聞美國如停購日本金銀、則將予日本以重大打擊、蓋在過去兩年中、日本曾以價值美金四一五·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元之黃金、與價值四·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元之白銀、售與美國也、（二十七日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）此間接近政府人士頃宣稱、財政部對於口本進口貨之以傾銷方式與美國貨物相競爭者、行將有所措施、而允注重於日本棉織品進口之限制、一俟明年一月二十六日美日商的滿期之後、或將循序實施下開各項措置、（一）日本船舶寄椗美國各港口者、加徵海港稅、（二）日本貨物推銷員限制進入美國、（三）禁止以軍械與軍用品運往日本、凡此種種、要當以日本在華如何對付美國利益、曁美國輿論與參議院是吾決心有所作為為轉移耳、以參議院而論、自英日初步協定成立以還、深恐引起不良影饗、加之美國在華利益仍受妨害、因而態度趨於強硬、赫爾國務卿在兩日之前、猶謂國務院態度並未變更、且曾要求共和黨參議員范登堡將廢的案展至國會下屆會期討論、乃至昨日突然決定廢的、卽因參議院態度硬化之故、美國政界人士對於廢的之舉、均有良好之反應、國務院中人則謂政府早有對日推行強硬政策之意、特恐輿論方面未能充分予以贊助、故遲至昨日始乃實行、共和黨人因廢的之議、創始於該黨參議員范登堡、認為黨的勝利、亦均感覺滿意、要而言之、民主黨共和黨茲已打成一片、國務院在遠東方面之外交行動、自可獲有便利、影響所及、其在歐洲倘欲有所行動、亦可較易為力矣、（二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（東京）日本各界聞美國率然廢棄一九一一年美日商的、大為震動、今益顯明、聞外相有田會告貴族院代表團、謂渠信美國之舉動、與保護其在華之權益有關、（二十八日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）日外務省午夜所發之文告、其最後一語、為「如美政府欲與日本另訂新的、以適應東亞新局勢、則日政府將欣然爲之」、今晨外務省招待新聞記者時、某記者舉此相詢、是吾為一種要求、發言人答稱、東亞新局勢當然需有新條的、此非要求、但為一種期望、目前並不擬要求美國承認東亞新局勢、（（二十八日路透社電）</p>
<p>（東京）日外相有田今晨將美政府通知廢止一九一一年美日商的事報告內閣、據可恃方面云、日政府將以鎮靜態度、注視局勢之發展、政府已擬定應付因美國或他國廢的而起的局勢之政策、政府亦不擬作對美另訂新的之發動、但將採靜待政策云、「中外商業新聞」稱、美日將來關係能吾和平、全視美政府今後之動作而定、日本朝野宜注視美政府今後之動作、而製定應付事變之對內對外具體政策云、「國民新聞」稱、美國廢止對日商的、此在日木海外貿易上未有嚴重影饗、惟廢的後之美國外交政策、應喚起日本方面之準備與决心、如美國以為廢的即足保障其在華權利、則其愚為不可及云、「朝日新聞」謂美國此舉、予日本以調整其對美關係之最好機會、中國新局勢旣造成英日關係之調整、則美日關係亦自應加以調整、政府宜利用美國廢的之機會、設法對美另訂新的、以適應東亞之新局勢云、「報知新聞」勸日本朝對力持鎮靜、以查明美國動機而注視美國此舉後、國際局勢中之各種發展、惟不可稍放棄其現有地位、且當堅定進行東亞新秩序之建設云、（二十八日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）美政府宣告廢止日美通商航海條的後、日外務省即於二十八日上午零時發表情報部長之談話、闡明日政府關於本問題之意見、談話內容如下、</p>
<p>美國政府向日政府正式通告廢止日美通商航海條的、然事出突然、且其理由簡單、美國用意何在、未能詳知、據美方聲稱、廢止條約之理由、美國政府在最近數年中、研究美國與諸外國交易所訂通商條約有無變更必要、其結果達到結論、以為現行日美通商航海條的中、載有須予以新考慮之條項若干、美政府為布置此種考慮、並應付新事態以保護美國權益起見、決定廢止現行條約、但美政府此種理由、又可為改訂條的之理由、未能說明其不得不突然通告廢止之理由也、美政府雖謂今决通告、與共和黨議員范　堡在參院外委會提議廢止日美通商航海條的問題並無關聯、然日英兩國正在東京談判津案之際、美國此舉、易使一般人認其必有一種重大政治的意義、遠東方面現有新事態以猛烈勢力發展中、日政府早將希望世界各國、對此事實增加正當認識、如美國政府應付遠東此種新事態而希望與日方訂新的、則日政府欣然準備應此希望、固不待言也（二十八日同盟電）</p>

<p>（華盛頓）關於美國政府突然廢除美日商的一事、國會人士包括孤立派咸皆一致贊許、報章亦千篇一律、表示擁護羅斯福此種果毅手段、政界人士咸料、廢除美日商的、乃美國採取更活躍的遠東政策之第一步驟、明年初國會復會以後、或將宣佈禁運軍火赴日、此議已由參院外委會主席畢德門在上决國會中提出、當時因美日商的尚仍存在、以致展緩討論、（二十八日海通社電）</p>
<p>（紐約）美國政府廢止美日兩國通商航海倏約事、此間各晨報頃加以評論、均皆甚為滿意、略謂、此乃遠東戰爭發生以還、美國鼓勵中國抗戰最重要之表示、其後來影響若何、美國不容加以顧慮、「紐的泰晤士報」載稱、「美國政府決定此舉、甚洽機宜、美國當此緊急關頭、明白聲明其對於遠東之傳統政策、乃所以提高此項政策之力量、此舉對於中國旣在道義上加以援助、英國政府對於日本若能採取較為堅強的政策、亦不患他人不加以贊助、英日兩國正在東京進行談判、日方擬要求英國對鎖滇緬公路、以斷絕中國接濟、從而在外交上獲一大勝利、茲美國政府旣已宣告廢的、則英國所處地位自因而加強、美國政府此舉、又不啻向日本政府發出聲明、謂吾國旣自承受有九國公的之的東、必須承認中國之領土行政完整主權獨立、並準備在訴諸戰爭之外、運用所有力量、俾中國之領土行政完整主權獨立、同為一般人所尊重、此在日本政府對於美國大多數人民堅決贊助國務院之事、亦絕無何項理由可以置疑、」「紐的民聲講壇報」載稱、美國輿論對於日本此種殘殺的冒險舉動、旣無與之「沆灈一所」之意、又不準備接受日本之哀的美敦　而與之斷絕外交關係、則廢止商的之舉、實乃唯一的正當辦法、觀於東京方面之反應、日本軍部似當在短時期之內、出以報復手段、果爾、則國務院當局即無復草擬新商的之餘暇矣、」（二十七日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）「明星晚報」之文、足以代表美國輿論之反應、其言有云、「政府此舉、必爲國人所擁護、美國權利遭人蔑視、迭經抗議、卒無效果、美國持以非常的忍耐心、已歷兩年之久、特吾國僑民迭受襲擊、吾國依據條的之合法權利、迭受侵犯、凡此種種、未便長此容忍、即在日本掌握政權之在熱的軍閥、亦所諗知、一言以蔽之、吾國忍耐心已達極度矣」云、（二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）據路透社外交訪員所探悉、英國各界多謂、美國之廢止對日商的、其所公布之時期、或係倏然擇定、然若謂此乃一種出人意表之舉動、則不盡確、蓋此舉表示英美遠東政策、現沿平行錢進行、不過兩國政府未嘗作互相束縛之嘗試耳、美國此舉當然使英國各界移其思慮、以考量此種方法之利用、俾保護其在遠東之權利、蓋以英國亦於一九一一年與日締結商的也、英國固未有碍及東京談話成功之意、但若為對於英國利益予以更大保護起見、覺有效法美國之必要、則英國亦將作廢止英日商的之考慮也、（廿八日路透電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）「新聞紀事報」今日評論謂、羅斯福總統歷來在外交政策上之措施、始終堅毅、且常使人興奮、然未有如此次廢止對日商約之甚者、無論此舉產生軍火禁令之結果與吾、然此廢約照會、乃政治上加諸日本之最重要的譴責、同時亦對於因英日妥治而稍覺煩惱之中國予以及時之鼓勵、無論羅斯福總統是否有意為之、渠廢止美日商的一舉、已在遠東政策中、予英政府以實物教訓矣云、（二十七日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）孟却斯德指導報今日社論謂、羅斯福總統之決定美日商的、乃美國將採行更嚴厲的行動之警告、如目前狀况繼續不已、則美國人民將要求停止對日之供給、而日本無此供給、將不能進行其對華之侵略云、伯明罕郵報力言美國此舉、及於東京英日談話之間接有益的影響、謂英美兩國對於遠東事件、顯然猶未行動一致、但步驟現更接近云、泰晤士報外交記者稱、美國廢約照會原文之研究、表示日方軍大刻正破壞美日條的之精神、按一九一一年英日條約、在許多方面確與美日條的相同云、（二十八日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）「每日電聞」今日社論請、羅斯福總統以其廢止美日商約之驟然決定、已向世界表示、民治國有時能在出人意表之策略上、與全能國相周旋、美國此舉、亦不過行使條的所賦予之權利而已、以視過去七年中、日本不恤悍然破壞凡與其政策相抵觸之任何條的上義務者、固迥不相同也、日木不獨破壞條的義務、且以避免正式對華宜戰之手段、謀閃避交戰國在法律上所應有之不便利、而同時復要求交戰國所可有之便利、如天津間題談判中所發見者、即其一證也、羅斯福總統此次舉動、將為一種有力的警告、即日本不能長此取巧、亦不能摧毀他國權益而不　早間惹起報復是也、設吾人觀察為不繆、則今漸至美國在遇此新發展時、不得不放棄其從前忍耐態度之時間矣云、（二十七日路透電）</p>

<p>最近之上海金融市塲，可謂極變動之能事矣！浮動之人心，經此重重刺戟，談虎色變，謠諑朋興。本欲限制提存，收束現鈔，而無如適以促其收現，貼現飛漲。原思緊縮外匯，防杜走漏，又無如反使外幣紙貴，黃金昂騰。凡此所以適得其反，皆因變動太驟，而演變適如流言，遂使恐慌之心理，非理智所能宰制矣。此而謂庸人自擾，因亦由於事實使然；此而謂爲不顧大局，安知其豈好爲之。要之，徒事責難，不足濟變也。</p>
<p>雖然，進外滙，買黃金，藏現鈔，移存於洋商銀行，究竟是吾資金最安全之辦法，抑為最有利之處理，夫人而知其為不盡然。蓋外滙至今日，昂貴已達於極點，法幣一元之值，不過四辨士許，英鈔一鎊所費，乃值法幣五十六元，為自中西互市以來所未有。自今而後，英匯之價，果將縮至三辨士兩辨士而至一辨士乎？誠如此說：則幣價落而物價漲，屆時所使用之貨幣，為外滙乎？為法幣乎？如果仍為法幣，則其利益所得，亦至有限。何况法幣之值，即無外人之支持，亦決不至於一跌再跌，乃至於四三辦士之下。蔣總裁嘗於本月二十四日在中央國府聯合紀念週時，負責聲明，其言日：「政府一定以全力維持法幣價值，一定能盡量維持法幣與外滙的比率，這是亳無問題的。」由此可知法幣之值，決不再跌，即使黑匯市塲，偶有變動，亦無損於法幣之毫末也。</p>
<p>至於黃金之值，隨外匯為轉移，外匯之率不變，黃金之價自平。若夫提存於洋商銀行，為其能存現取現，無限制之授受也誠然。若謂其別具保障，則亦未必。蓋存法幣者付法幣，法幣果至一文不值，所存於洋商銀行者亦同歸於盡。且使現鈔流入於洋商銀行庫中，擴充其支配金融市塲之實力，而將華商銀行數十年奮鬥經營之功，隳於垂成，能不可惜。要知「淪陷區域內法幣行使，更有充分準備，加以切實維持，決不使我民生受絲毫影響，決不使同胞受幾微損失，」蔣總裁已鄭重言之矣。則對於法幣之將來，更有何疑懼之可有。况幾經提現之結果，華商銀行之實力，亦可試騐得之矣。近兩月來，提現擁擠，事實所在，無庸爲諱。然華商銀行應付裕如，絕無有捉襟見肘之象，苟非平時準備充實，安能應付此緊張之局面耶？</p>
<p>由是以觀，母以外力為足恃，資金逃避為可靠。彼重視現實者無遠猷，禮帽高聳，目光為蔽，正有類於井底之蛙。豈眞有所深愛於我哉！利我之尚有資財耳。資財盡，亦將望望然而去之。至投機而成暴富者，宜可挾其巨資，為垣街之一小存戶，然其勢亦難持久，若數萬數十萬之資，論其按月入息，尚不如紐的一乞丐，亦亟亟於逃避，固何為哉！要知求未來之生存，全仗自力；即求經濟之復興，何嘗不仗自力；若無自力，何有他力；如英國此後仍為我外滙作援助固佳，即使不然，吾人亦惟有盡其自力之所能，保全巳有之外匯，孳生未來之外滙而已。然與此作息息相關者，厥為我本身之金融間題。金融者，一切事業之母也；金融組織健全，信用鞏固，能盡其正當之職務，能不為投機所操縱，則足以發展工商維護社會而有餘。若以巨數現鈔，存之於洋商銀行，投之於不生產之外幣黃金，不徒增加洋商銀行之實力，且使華商銀行陡减活動之資金，勢必對於工商業融通周轉，發生窒礙，馴至實業凋敝，金融枯澀，總崩潰大恐慌之來臨，孰能在此圈氛之外！故惟有使金融界發展其原有之機能，而後可策資金之安全。吾人所希望於金融界者，於其一舉一動，小之足以影響工商，大之足以牽動社會，故宜審慎於事先，綢繆於事後，勿掉以輕心，勿操之過急，凡可增加存戶信任之舉動，固望其忠實履行；即對於客戶不正當之用途，亦宜設法限制。利固為金融界所重視，但吾人允冀其以義為利，以大利遠利爲利無以一時小利爲利者也。</p>
<p>所望於大衆者，買存之外幣黃金，未來之行市，高於此者能有幾何！曷一加計算，高漲之時，與低落之時，孰為多乎？假如後之行市尚勝於今，則所獲固豐，而危險亦滋甚！又所儲存之現鈔，望其孳息乎？抑望其為封存之廢紙乎？貨幣失其流通，效用已失。然所以窖藏現幣，殆亦為變更「八一三」安定金融辦法必然之後果。由是而知金融界之信用有不可疏忽者矣，駟不及舌，豈容一摘再摘。故為金融界計，當不至再有限制提存之舉！為一般計，正應集其全力，應付此非常之局面，不宜削弱金融界之實力，妨碍方在奮鬥過程中之生存。明於此，則將資金復歸於華商銀行之庫中，俾盡其貨幣之效能，供金融界之運用，工商界之發展，此固經濟上自力生存之道也。</p>

<p>（重慶）外部王部長、頃就美國宜佈廢止美日商的事、二十八日對外國記者發表談話如下、美國素以富於正義觀念著稱、中國對於美國人民、大都富有堅決不搖之信仰、美國務卿赫爾現已以（一九一一）年美日商約中所含條款、須予以重新之考慮、照會日本、於六個月期滿後、將該約廢止、美國政府之為此種決定、予知其必已將日本軍閥在政治商務各方面所造成之（東亞大紊亂）、予以充分考慮、該的之宣告廢止、實可視為美國願意維持其太平洋區域之地位與威望之一種表現、美國如進而採取更確實更積極之態度、於其權力範圍內、盡共能事、以遏止國際問之凌亂無法、以恢復國際間之和平互信及好感、則允為吾人所馨香禱祝者也、實在美國對於遠東及世界其他部份之和平、均可實施共決定的成權、而無須從事戰事、美國之力量威望及其輿論、茍能為確切之表示、則足使國際問之正義法律與秩序、均獲有裨益、（廿八日電）</p>

<p>（重慶）戰時首都自接美國政府宣告廢止一九一一年美日商的後、華政府當局及人民、成認為此乃美國政府表示極端關心遠束局勢之初步、自日木實行侵華以來、各友邦均以最大忍耐、靜觀其推移、美英各國對日屢為友誼之忠告、彼不但置若罔聞、而侵害各友邦在華利益之行動、趨木加厲、益趨積極、推共用心、非根本推翻美英各國在遠束地位不可、最近日軍在被佔據區城內、侮辱迫害各國僑民之事、更舉不勝舉、羅斯福總統似己痛切感覺日方行動、絕非空言所能曉喻、不得已乃採取廢止商的之舉、促共反省、日本出口貿易、以美洲為最大主顧、幾佔全出口額百分之七十、若美日兩國變成無條約狀態、則日本出口貿易所受影饗之大、誠非數字所可計算、其經濟基礎之崩潰、僅為時間問題、且日本所需要之棉花·生鐵·鋼·汽油·木材等、皆將斷絕來源、其軍事行動、必受重大打繫、蓋無疑義、東京大阪證券市塲、已發生暴跌風潮、可以窺見其人心之動搖矣、廢的生效期間、雖在六個月以後、但在未生效力之前、美國總統亦有權提高日貨入口稅率、或禁止日貨入口、故羅斯福總統於廢的後所採取之第二第三步驟、更為舉世所注視、華方朝野對於羅斯福總統採取此種斷然措置、莫不欽佩其高邁之認識、與果敢之決心、日本在過去兩年問所受打擊、以此决為最重大、其將成為致命之打擊、蓋有充分之可能性、觀日本各太新聞所表示之態度、勸告其國民須力持鎮靜、足見其內心之恐慌、迪非尋常事件所可比擬矣、（二十八日電）</p>
<p>（重慶）中國經濟部長翁文灝今日對美聯社記者言、中政府對於美國廢止美日商約極爲滿意、認爲積極對付日本之開端、美國此一行動之意義、極堪注意、以整個遠東之局勢、全依美政府之態度爲轉移也、我人深知日本必將歧視第三國在遠東方面之權益、若不迅採行動、則禍將益大面不可收拾、此後國際關係合理的調整、美國必須出爲領導、在同樣之方向上採取其他之措置、良以一種好榜樣樹立之後、他國卽可繼之而起、翁氏又信英國必將繼續援助中國云、（二十八日美聯電）</p>
<p>（重慶）華人各界咸信美國之廢止對日商業及航業條約、將使英國在東京會議之地位、大為增强、中國現正希望英國此後對付日本將採取更强硬之立塲、彼等又稱、英國未必取較其空泛之宣言、更進一步之行動、此項宣言能作更廣大之解釋、昨晚此間人士、皆以美國廢約之消息、爲談話之資料、棒熱烈愉快之情緒、不亞於昔日接獲台兒莊勝利消息之時、今晨各華文報紙、皆以大字登載此項消息、並冠以「日本之致命打擊」、及「東京之新震動」等字樣之標題、（二十八日路透社電）</p>
<p>（重慶）此間聯合日報今日評論美國廢止美日商的之行動、足以打破美國中立法延期討論以來中國對於美國之模糊、據稱、「日本之軍火由美國供其大部、但一至美國實施軍火禁令之後、必將大受妨碍、軍火禁令實爲遏阻侵略者最有效之利器、今後必能成為維持九國公的與國際聯盟之唯一武器、美國今茲之行動、又明示美國對於國際條約之義務、固無時不為設法履行、叉明示美國對於遠東局勢之轉趨注意也、同時美國此一行動、又使美國與共他愛好和平之國家、形成同一之陣錢、更顯示美國有制止侵略者之潛在力量、又為對於日本之一種經濟的報復、亦所以表示美國有保持共遠東地位、促進世界和平之決心、美國今决之行動、又為中國國際關係轉好之表現、但亦為中國決計繼續抗戰之結果」、（二十八日美聯電）</p>

<p>（東京）今日英日圓桌會議集議三小時、至午後一時休會、定星期一晨再行討論、聞今日談話進行頗順、關於貨幣問題之討論、業已完畢、但決定之性質現尚未悉、雙方旋談判天津英租界存銀移交等事、聞昨晨圓桌會議、對於維持天津英租界和平與秩序事頗有進步、惟午後六小時之會議、對於日方禁止租界中法幣流通之提議、迄未獲有同意、聞會議時日代表聲稱、租界內中國法幣之繼續流通、乃華北經濟紊亂之原因、英方應依據有田克萊琪妥洽之目的、切實禁止其流通、而英代表所持之態度、則與此相反、謂英政府當然援助中政府所發行之法幣、在英國繼續承認中政府之時、英國決不能依允禁止法幣之使用云、（二十八日路透社電）</p>
<p>（東京）今日日本各報所載關於東京英日會議之消息、適與官方文告中所載、此項會議正在親善空氣中順利進行之說相背馳、據各報載稱、英日會議已因日本要求天津英租界禁止巾國法幣流通及交出英租界各華商銀行所存現銀事陷於停頓、聞美代表雖承認交通銀行存有價值一千四百萬元之白銀、惟不久交出、日方乃援引有田克萊琪之妥洽、要求天津英租界所存中中交農四行現銀應交北平「臨時政府」、雙方意見大相懸殊云、（二十八日路透電）</p>

<p>（柏林）關於美國宣佈廢除美日商的一事、此間政界人士認為乃一種政治行動、柏林各報昨晚咸稱、美國此舉之目的、在帮助英國、同時相信不久美國將禁止軍火運往日本、「金融報」發表一文、題為「太平洋上之制裁戰爭」、中稱、美國多數報章老早即主張强硬對日、而羅斯福總統與赫爾國務鄉所以不待參院之討論、而逕予實行、者乃華盛頓方面避免捲入「英國在遠東之失敗」、該報相信商的廢止後、美國將繼以宣佈禁運軍火赴日、此於日本、不無重大影饗、蓋現時日本一切軍火、百分之五十七係來自美國也、「德意志總彙報」亦發表社評、力言此舉乃英美在遽東合作之第一結果、該報申稱英國在遠東、現已退至新加坡，其地位大有求人援助之勢、美國廢除美日商的之眞正動機、即在挽回天津之失敗、但該報相信、日本亦將採取强硬措施、以圖抵制云、（廿八日海通電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）美國政府廢止美日商的之後、義國政界人士因此舉影響遠東前途、咸極感覺興趣、並謂此乃美國對日本施行關稅政策之先聲、原來日本經濟、允其是眾事工業所需原料品、如棉鐵煤油三項幾完全仰賴美國供給、自不免遭受嚴重影響、於以見美國措施、實乃完全根據政治觀點、亦即該國當局欲對日本政府行使壓力所致、（二十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>重慶通訊，此聞新蜀報載有沈起予君譯述，署名青山和夫撰著之某國內部危機一則，茲轉錄如下，</p>
<p>吾人所計劃，所參與的朝鮮義勇隊，從本年初以來，即參加着中國軍隊的武裝正規軍戰和游擊隊的戰爭。</p>
<p>一面，反戰工作也由一般的工作轉移為集中的工作，在武漢，日本軍隊之有計劃的反戰運動得到了成功，今後將益努力於反戰工作的進行。</p>
<p>在日本國內，一般反戰民眾，亦開始集中於政治鬥爭，因此。法西斯的『東方會』和『社大黨』之合併，根本陷於不可能。同時，日本法西斯勢力，大致亦陷於分裂狀態，關東軍派與華北軍派及華中華南派正從事於明爭暗鬥。關東軍派主張進攻蘇聯，而華北軍及華中華南軍兩派，則主張附着德，義，日三國的軍事回盟。被強制於這兩派間的平沼內閣，則常常動搖而不定；此內閣會對內對外均屬無力而又尚無倒閣現象發生者，正因為法西斯勢力之互相分裂而從事於傾軋之故。</p>
<p>另外，從物質一面說來，也因為受到戰事而陷於極端缺乏，其缺乏之程度，竟到了想將有名的奈艮的大佛像加以破壞，以圖獲得銅金的補充，現在正在調查這佛像的價值。</p>
<p>從軍隊的補充上說，日本亦陷於極端的困難。現在殘留在日本國內的人，都是不能當兵的體格，據說本年中的男女的比例，竟到了男子一人女子二十人之比。在九州，雖有「青年團」的組織存在，但此類組織，已多是「空空如也」而沒有一個團員存在。</p>
<p>從工業說來，現在僅有軍需工業存在，屬於和平的產業者，在全國，竟有一百三十萬的工人失業。目前，因為日本政府將來，牛奶，雞蛋，糖等類食糧，強制輸出外國，以企獲得軍費之故，食料品也告極端的不足。尤有甚者，日本近來更頒布了「國民微用令」，這算是把中國已經免除了「夫役」（拉夫）現象，強制於日本全國國民了。</p>

<p>植物蛋白質所含者之多惟後者須經化學分解方得多量的麩酸是以味粉一物卽右旋性麩酸一鈉之由植物蛋白質製成者往日視為奢侈品今則與油鑒等並重為日常烹飪所不可缺之必需物味粉之有今日可為東方民族之榮者有一二為</p>
<p>應用化學之善於利用一為生活術之講究考麩酸已於一八六八年為德人「烈好辛」氏（Rittbausen）發現烈氏會用硫酸分解植物蛋白質得之當時僅為科學上</p>
<p>新奇發現却不知利用共所得以作實用誰知五十年後東方人乃用之為日用必需之品直接增進個人食慾與口福間接增進民族之康健與繁榮此固善於利用化學之結果然亦吾東方人生活術講究之結果也由此可見西方科學雖昌明但生活術遠不如束方人之研究此亦東西文化各有所長之表示也</p>

<p>— 潘仰堯</p>
<p>（一）製造技術創新標準</p>
<p>吾國味粉製造廠之在上海者大小不下二十家而標準廠之設備特新茲就余所見及之該廠自行設計創製造技術最進步之新標準者試舉二端言之；</p>
<p>A·水解時間縮短一倍以上：味粉製造之程序中普通水解時問常壓式為三十六小時其因設備簡陋有至六十小時者惟標準廠最新發明常壓式之水解時間僅二十小時而加壓式僅十小時經名家參觀證明認為在味粉製造技術上確已創造最新標準</p>
<p>B·蒸發免臭設備成功：普通蒸發設備均有臭氣散溢之弊致鄰近居民發生厭惡茲標準廠之免臭裝置利用眞空原理將所有臭氣凝縮並收囘一部份之鑒酸故人立灶前亦不聞臭氣此項新發明不經上海公共租界衛生處及工業科贊揚認為味　製造廠應有之最新設備標準</p>
<p>（二）工作效率創新標準</p>
<p>普通工廠因工作之放任與管理之鬆弛以致效率甚低惟標準廠則自姚總經理俊之先生以至工友槪以遵行其標準廠訓誠·勤·恆·耐　四字為準繩且因最新科學管理故所獲致之工作效率至為驚人開業以來三個月出粉數量與工作人數之比例竟超過一般工廠得三倍以上之效觀其全廠精神實注宜其效率創新標準矣</p>
<p>（三）出品質量創新標準</p>
<p>因有上列二項新創標準故標準廠的出品數量使人驚奇至於國內外受人熱烈歡迎暢銷的情形是因為牠的出品「九味一」與「鮮大王」的品質高超不論內行外行凡稍為研究共成份就知道其質地確比其他國產調味粉更為純潔故標準廠所常用之「完全蛋白果鮮味養胃」一語已為味粉質地之新標準矣以上三端僅就余管見所及的略述之好在該廠歡迎各學術團體前往參觀各界不妨去函接洽作一决更詳盡之親自參考可也</p>

<p>九味一及鮮大王行世以後因其品質精　裝新雅國人均不信國貨中竟有如此佳品洋人亦希奇中國人所出貨品竟有如此進步</p>
<p>但事實竟是事實以國人資本國人經營國人技術盡量採用國貨原料則下而努力之標準廠畢竟以標準味粉九味一　　大王成功了　貨標　工作之一</p>
<h3 id="c69">國貨調味粉之標準化問題 <a href="#c69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— 化學博士周定一</p>
<p>調味粉之歷史在吾國僅十餘年設廠製造者僅十餘家而近來</p>
<p>設立之新廠倍增此固實業界之慶幸然其中包含一重大問題卽如何使調味品標準化以增進</p>
<p>國貨之馨譽於海外年余先後主持中央及上海市兩衛生試驗所化學科曾手訂飲食物條例多則對於調味品之標準會首先發表麩酸鈉暫行試驗方法正擬着手整理</p>
<p>市上之味粉因戰事爆發工作中斷九仞一簣引為遺憾現目擊市上調味品名目繁多品類龐雜深感有加以整顧之絕對必耍世界各國飲食物法雜其視為最千禁例者輒為攙和物（Adulterants)尤以美國各州法律為甚故對於任何飲食物之有攪和物者莫不　取締如　酸鈉中含有機　之鈉鹽等均當列為攙和物砍言調味粉之標準吾人必須先有一調</p>
<p>味粉之定義卽「調味粉者乃一富含右旋性麩酸一鈉之製品其中得含有少量之氣化鈉（食鑒）」此為比較合理之定義據此因　下列之幾種標準成份：</p>
<p>甲級調味粉標準</p>
<p>麩酸鈉　含量不得少於百分之乃十五</p>
<p>食　鹽　含量不得冬於百分之</p>
<p>事實上因一般顧客喜用較有刺激味覺性之多鑒調味粉起見應冉有乙級標準之規定：</p>
<p>乙級調味粉標準</p>
<p>麩酸鈉　含量不得少於百分之七十</p>
<p>食　鹽　含量不得多於百分之二十</p>
<p>若照上列甲乙級之成份混和其他攪和物（因結晶水份的佔麩酸鈉之一分子量）為不可能但實際市上味粉所含麩酸鈉有低至百分之十六攙除食鹽外幾達</p>
<p>百分之六十此種自殺政策實足自毀其已有之市場故製造者於品質之退化負有極重大之責任亟宜有所謀「調味粉標準化」之事實奉獻於市場則味粉前途幸甚國貨前途幸甚標準味粉廠之創設動機卽在此一切</p>
<p>設計之目標亦卽以此所出「九味一」及「鮮大王」二種味粉問世以來幸蒙各界讚頌用者滿意此聊足自國人技術國人財力團人機本國原料各項條件下產生一種合乎上列甲種</p>
<p>標準之味粉以供應社會在此充斥着攪和物之味粉市場中推動着優勝劣敗的天然淘汰原理獲得主顧的愛戴和愛用國貨者之永久信任</p>

<p>上海市米號業同業公會緊急通告云、近日米價高漲、市塲交易混亂、最次白粳照限價每石二十元竟無處可購、高米米樣絕跡於市、於是發生暗盤逾越限價情事、此種行為、賣買居間、均屬非法、為此切實勸告我同業各米號、務須恪遵租界當局限價、高白粳每石不得超過國幣二十元、客秈每石不得超十六元、如因需要高米應市、在此市情混亂之際、奪可暫忍一時、切勿越價購進、如有暗盤越限成交者、照限價算賬、並應盡情向本會舉發、以便據以報告當局澈查究辦、凡我同業、幸勿徇情私相授受、自取其咎、尙祈一體嚴格遵守、再本會頃奉法公董局通知、法租界各米號自即日起每日須將米價照限價書明、縣牌門前、並希一體遵辦為荷、</p>
<p>棧存粳米　悉屬白粳</p>
<p>連日來租界當局嚴厲執行限價、各米商囤戶及投機份子、乃避實就虛、利用市塲作暗盤交易之接洽處、而在塲外、實行私相授受、對於最高白粳及普通白粳、自週一起即不出樣、致市塲白粳絕跡、但實際上各堆棧存貨二十多萬包、大都均屬白粳、當局有鑒於此、正調查貨主姓名、勸導出售、勿居奇操縱、影響民食、</p>
<p>存米囤戶　業已查明</p>
<p>上海之存米、均堆在各行莊堆棧以及各貨棧內、租界當局為防止囤積投機操縱起見、已派員向各堆棧澈查貨主姓名、以便核辦聞已查得某銀行堆棧之米、係業外人所團積、企圖投機牟利、當局當耶命令該貨主依照規定限價以下全部出售、同時希望市民隨時向捕房舉發各米行號超越限價事件、如為查明屬實、則決予查辦、並對超越限價之交易、一槪認為無效、</p>
<p>民食絕對　無慮匱乏</p>
<p>滬市民食絕對不慮匱乏、其原因有六、（一）全市各棧存貨、共計有數十萬包、足供應全市應用而有餘、（二）蕪湖禁米出境、經疏通後、八月一日即可恢復運輸、（三）米業團體及租界當局、刻正積極疏通各地來源、（四）月前每日到貨、平均有三千包以上、（五）東新粳旬日後可上市、（六）其他各新米亦將上市、</p>
<p>當局處置　存米步驟</p>
<p>公共租界工部局法租界公董局、為防止囤戶投機操縱、影響全市民食起見、業已聯合通知各銀行錢莊堆棧及私人臨時租棧、即將存米數量及貨主姓名、限期詳為具報、據大光社記者探悉、當局此舉完全澈底查明此項存米、是否在米行商或非同業手中、而其何以囤積不售、預定第一步辦法、勸告囤戶從連出售、以維市面、如經勸吿方式、仍未能獲有結果、則己知彼輩國戶、有意居奇操縱無疑、將採用第二步辦法、適當處置、以强制性之方式行之、務使市塲交易、供求相應、市價躋於平衡、</p>
<p>平民希望　辦理平糶</p>
<p>此次上海米市之反常漲價、原因固若無投機囤戶之操縱居寄抬價、當不致繼漲不已、是以一般市民、對日常必需之食糧、生活担負倍增、而允以一班貧苦市民、痛若切膚、對賢明之租界當局、維持民食主張、莫不欣慰外、更盼望當局勒令囤戶迅籌平糶辦法、以惠平民、而輕負担、</p>
<p>昨晨市塲　交易停頓</p>
<p>豆米行業公會福州路米業市場、於昨晨九時開市後、因囤戶方面仍取觀望態度、將上中號各米均無樣携入市塲、除少數秈米略有應市外其餘各米均無貨賣買、故市塲形式上雖開市、而實際陷有停頓狀態、此種原因、仍不免有投機者之操縱、希望當局注意及之、以維市塲正常交易、</p>
<p>越價私售　拒開發票</p>
<p>兩租界當局為維持民食、嚴厲執行限價、如久大米號超越限價、即被吊銷營業執照之處分、其他逾限之米店多家、亦均受同樣處分、故人心轉定、現有一部份米店、為避免處罰、對於逾越限價之米、拒開發票、希望市民隨時檢舉、報告捕房、協助當局維持米價、</p>

<h3 id="c125">銀錢業同人組織　消費合作社 <a href="#c125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>— 流浪</p>
<p>解決生活威脅為同人謀抻福利　國貨廠商同情給予特別折扣</p>
<p>在生活程度畸形高漲的現在，每一個薪給階級在開源乏術，節流無方的苦悶時期，各團體及熱心人士能有消費合作社的組織，自然是不勝雀躍三百的，銀聯會同人或許是環境關係，能深切感到這種組織的需耍而迅速地成立起來，更是使我們高興的，但是從流浪先生這篇文章中看來，好像他們的顧客是祇限於會員及銀錢界的同人，而不能普遍地待遇一般主顧，這似乎是遺憾。希望能够更進一步，為全上海同胞謀福利，那眞是功德無量。同時，其他比較有力量的團體，也希望他們能够迅速地自各組織起來，使全滬市民度過這個艱難的時期。（編者）</p>
<p>從本報刊出「敎師十九人的來函」和「迫切的呼額的回聲」以後，一般小職員都寄與一陣同情的熱淚，他們生活的慘狀，活生生呈現在社會每一角落里，自動緊縮節的的呼聲，更暴露薪給階級生活困難的惰形來。</p>
<p>這三個月來外匯的再度緊縮，刺激得物價無限制飛漲，商人乘風推浪，利用機會將存貨大漲特漲，允其是生活必需品的漲價，給予職員們莫大的威脅！</p>
<p>孤島的薪給階級的生活有什麼保障呢？政府的權力已不能壓制物價上升，雖然不少賢明當局瞭解職員們生活的實際困難情形，津貼若干戰時生活補助費；可是，津貼終追不上生活指數的市長，所以整個職員層還是被恐怖的命運威脅着</p>
<p>這里，我來介紹一個用實踐和團結力量來减低同人生活負擔的組織——銀錢業消費合作社，使全市的職員們，可以效法銀錢界自動助人和精誠合作的精神，積極自動組織起來，擔負起减輕生活威膏和福利工作的責任！</p>
<p>在去年十月里，銀錢業中一個唯一業餘團體銀業聯誼會發起消費合作社的組織，當時就有二百多人踴躍參加，後來得到銀錢界前輩像徐寄庼林康侯秦潤卿裴雲卿吳蘊齋等二十餘位贊助，使發起的宗旨更深入到每一個銀錢業同人中去，在三四月間舉行第二决微求運動的時候，社員總數激增將近一千人，社股達二千六百餘元，這倘偉大的　獲，予許多熱心工作人員極大的愉快和興奮，因此就決定五月廿一日在銀行公會召集成立大會了。</p>
<p>社員一千人期望下的合作社，要求能替他們解除生活的雙重壓迫，所以成立大會那天聚集了六百位銀錢業優秀靑年，討論他們本身有關福利的事業，當塲通過社章和許多提議</p>
<p>該社經過二個月充分籌備時間，現在定於明天（三十日）開始營業了，社址就在聯誼會，雖然地位非常狹隘，不過，聽說他們巳在向外面接洽貨棧及辦公的地方，如果電話購貨，即便在現在的情形之下，想也不致為了社址的大小而發生多大問題。</p>
<p>最困難的倒是進貨的價格要比二個月前漲起三五成，那末在减低售價，服務社員的原則下，合作社將如何來配備社員所需要的貨物呢？因為市上所售的物品，大都是存貨，而新創的合作社却都是新貨，那未如何去减低售價呢？然而在他們的理事潘仰堯氏主持之下，也順利的取得許多國貨廠商的同情，給予特別折扣，甚至照未漲價前的價目賣給合作社</p>
<p>現在他們已購得大批白米，煤球，另外如洗衣皂，午投製醬油，和其他毛巾，襪子，蚊香，玻璃器，便紙，等等家庭日用品，應有盡有，供給一千社員和一萬銀錢界同人的需要，在現階段必經的艱苦過程里，得到一些生活保障，减少物價高漲的威脅。</p>
<p>為了鄭重辦理新與事業和引起社會上對於職員生活的注意起見，他們特請林康侯先生　行揭幕禮，並且請各行莊當局經常監督和愛護之下，使得為同人做些眞正有福利的工作。</p>

<p>“Ony　Angels　Have　Wings”</p>
<p>哥倫比亞出品　大光明戲院映</p>
<p>以航空為題材的電影，不論為鼓勵人民效忠於國家，或忠於職責，其用意總是値得嘉許的。「英雄情種」是寫一羣忠於職責的靑年飛行師，他們都是在濃霧的惡劣氣候中，不辭危險，駕駛飛機運送郵件；及這羣年靑人底眞摯的友誼。可是「美雄情種」和一般電影犯了一個共同的弊病，就是故事的缺乏統一性：飛行員佐意和龐妮的他鄉遇知己，相與同遊，及佐意的駕機遇害，可以自成一段落；麥克波之加入航空隊，又是另外一個段落，雖然劇作者以龐妮之熱戀卡德為貫穿道兩者的媒介，然總留着一條不能互通聲氣的鴻溝在也。</p>
<p>處理這個複雜而緊張萬分的故事，導演手腕是相當高强的。第一，因為背景的單調，他把地方色彩演染得非常濃厚，這是他的聰明之處。譬如：他開始介紹南美巴倫卡某港時，大霧籠罩下的街道，熱帶人物的素描，小酒吧間的特殊風情，音樂，歌聲…都充份地勾劃了熱帶獨特的情調，而最後，他以靜幽的歌聲來陪襯卡德的情緒衝突，是更見可愛。</p>
<p>卡德和龐妮的羅曼斯是寫得非常糢糊的，而且因為許多緊張塲面的運績發生，這劇作者為貫穿兩個段落的媒介是顯得更沒有力量了。至於空中的驚險塲面，或許是這類的電影看得太多了，後面幾塲正面描寫的飛機失事，我以為反不及佐意遇害那塲的動人。</p>
<p>佐意遇害那塲劇是這樣的：佐意　逅龐妮後，頗為歡樂；突奉駕機載送郵件；天空濃霧重重。，卡德在無綫電中命暫折回飛行塲，待霧散後降落；卡德，龐妮及同事在塲附近以無綫電呼應；機聲的由遠而近；探照燈的放射；飛機降迫地面。卡德高喊「上升，！」；羣衆的緊張情緒；飛機冉决下降；傳來巨聲，救護車出動；卡德和龐妮的悲痛；這塲戲雖後有正面寫佐意的飛機失事，但窒息的氣氛，却達於極點。卡萊葛倫的總指揮卡德，頗沉着。琪思亞瑟的龐妮，祇是可愛而己。</p>

<p>第十四回　烟火千家鄉村合作　波濤萬里瀛海飛行</p>
<p>實在担任建筑工程，是他的職業，職　中於一切，也打擾不了他們結婚的事。造廠屋的時候，還附帶着建筑一座別墅。雖然這位何先生會經對他的兩位小姐說過：『那個別墅，不必要怎樣大，只供他們一家父女，暫可棲身，就已足够了。』何先生的意思，就因為上海那個地方，太熱鬧了。因此要離開上海，覓一個淸靜的地方，建屋數楹，以為休憇之所。司是又不能離上海太遠，有什麼事，要兩三點鐘司以趕到上海。何家兩位小姐，覺得我們的廠基在這裏，別墅也在這裹，最妥適的事。而且離上海不很遠，這個自由村，在鬧中取靜，也適合父親的條件，父親也一定是贊成的。只是那個別墅，父親雖說不必太大，仰乎也不宜過小。因為父親現在的職業，是辦理國際貿易上種種的事，所交往的，有許多國外的富商大買。偶然招待他們一决作郊外耍游，也可以請他們到家裹來，那末這個屋子，就可以算我們的鄉別墅。這種鄉下別墅，在歐美間是常有的。因此她們的意思，房子不必過於寬大，却是要一個廣大的花園。花園也不必過於富麗，却是要一塊寬敝的草地。可以在夏天開開園游會，招持數十位來賓的地方，却是要的。還有一件事，原來何先生同他的兩位小姐從家裏出來了，而何小姐的母親，和她的弟弟，還在廣州。這位母親，並不是親生兩位何小姐的。這生了一胞雙胎的何小姐的母親，却已經故世了。比刻在廣州的那位母親，却是繼母。她們也有兩位弟弟，一位今年是十一歲，一位今年是八歲，却沒有妹妹。這兩位弟弟，都還是在小學校裹讀書，所以何先生不曾帶他們到上海來。此刻在上海旣然有了一個別墅，這位繼母，也許帶了她的兩位弟弟，到這裏來。即使不是常住在這裹，偶然住幾十天，或是在署假裹，游玩一兩個月，也未嘗不可呢。那末這屋子也是要預備好的，不能過於局促。因此這別墅的房子建筑，大槪情形，不能不問問父親。在上海，倘然父親沒有什麼熟識的建築工程師，那就可以吿訴父親，就託林建成設計打樣了。（一六四）</p>

<p>因為內地交通阻隔，運輸不便，加之國貨工廠很少向內地遷移，貨物皆係由各地運往，故昆明之物價，飛漲不巳。舶來品固不必說，就是當地土貨，亦貴得不可開交。就將下列之日常用品觀之，大有令人昨舌之慨。牙膏每支八角肥皂每塊一元</p>
<p>牙刷（普通）一元一支　雪花膏一元六角一瓶</p>
<p>米價三十二元一石　猪肉八角一斤</p>
<p>西裝襯衫（府綢）每件七元　（紡綢）每件十元</p>

<h3 id="c130">喜樂（七） <a href="#c130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>基督的真理，博大精深，何以僅為喜樂二字，浪費筆　呢？誠以喜樂二字，是基督徒最安裝步最真確的經驗，所以不得不先言喜樂。聖使徒保雖寫書信的時候，專為喜樂二字，費盡三千餘言，（腓立比書）可是喜樂與其中真道，最關重要。若有人說：我信基督我並沒有喜樂。我說：你還沒有初步的經驗，談不到基督的真道，因為你的信心，還有問題。叉有人說：我信基督，我的喜樂，忽濃忽淡，有無不常，即俗所謂波浪式的生活。我說：你初步的經騐不眞確，正是你的信心不眞確，你要從信心上追究，不必從喜樂上追究。</p>
<p>喜樂：旣日基督徒的初步，並不是神秘道理，那麼，世人就測有一個能懂得的麼？我說：有。孔顏懂得，孔顏之徒無不懂得，所以可稱為真樂。我鶁一個例：孔子的門徒會點言志的時候，說到一段風舞　的樂趣，孔子高聲贊歏，佩服的五體投地，就是這樣的喜樂。這樣的喜樂，是天（神）人合一，古今聖賢哲人，無不懂得。他們雖然懂得，而喜樂的徑途，頗不易尋，所以世人無法尋求。原因是天（神）人相去太遠，人無法與天通。惟有基督，是人也是神，是神人的媒介，人可以藉著基督，與神交通。神人有交通，就是天人</p>
<p>合一，喜樂之真而且大，無逾於此。</p>

<p>法國已吞併安南數省，今又虎視緬甸，蓋緬甸與安南毘連，犬牙交錯，法之肆其鯨吞，勢必然也。前駐法公使返斾故國，及其回任時，法廷特命其順道往緬甸，實必包藏禍心，將藉端啟景，割據稱雄。其公使之隨員，會有大論一則，卓議風生，刋佈於法字日報。溯緬甸即朝鮮後裔，素為中國屏藩，入貢稱臣，傾心皇上，歷數百年未與法國通問。邇來遺一介之使，出聘歐洲，則得興法相往還，而訂交未久，緬甸王之喬梓，識見未充，行為愚戇，治內未能棼理，外患是以憑凌。前會觸英國之怒，兵連禍結，割取緬甸之南。其國王以此為恥，屢圖恢復。一千八百五十七年曾遺一西士名魯智頓者，使於歐洲，彼自以為得緬甸多十尼將軍之頭銜，遂乃炫耀，實不知西人如何夤緣營鎭，得邀寵於緬甸王也。旣承王命出使於法之巴尼斯京城，在魯智頓皇然以欽使自命，且欲法以欽使禮接待之，法廷不以其為使臣，故未優禮，祇准其請法之精　軍器工人，往其國作藝，蓋緬甸王欲在其國內建一軍器局也。一千八百七十一年意大利國舟師奉命駕戰艦往緬甸，欲叩關請謁，立約通商，然後緬甸王特再遺一使往法意英三國，該使頗識英法二國語言文字，另有一精通緬甸語之英人相輔，而三國均未以使臣之禮相待。惟法國則遺一使往緬甸，以為答報，其携餽之禮物，頗焜爠琳瑯也。</p>

<p>冰淇淋是發胖劑－女星戒物　假期內召回拍戲－怨聲載道</p>
<p>夏天的季候風，把熱浪吹進了好萊塢，使影城里充滿了炎夏的氣象。女星們都穿起新穎的厦裝，盡量暴露肉感的美態，更戴上太陽眼鏡，來抵當目前强烈的陽光。戶外的冷飲店也都上市，出售水其林，各種菓汁及薄荷製劑等，生意興隆非凡，但同時發現了一個寄蹟，這個奇蹟，是各冷飲店主的一致報道。馬說在他們的貨品中，冰淇淋最不受女星們的歡迎，因為冰洪淋內含有奶油和蛋黃等富於營養的物品，吃了會使人發胖，（其實少吃些不要緊）「發胖」是婀娜多姿的勁敵，無怪她們要視為戒物而放棄不吃了。</p>
<p>其次値得一提的。。在這「夏日炎炎正好玩」的時節，網球，游泳等戶外運動，影星們進行得很熱烈；有些影星則趁着假期幾會，暫避煩囂的都市，到距離不遠的鄉村去憇息，一過幽靜的生活。然而雖在假期內，影片公司當局會隨時催促去拍戲，這眞是一件令人掃興的事，因此怨聲載道，當然難免像波脫灰羅（Beit　heeler）便是其中之一，當他剛與瑪麗蕙兒馨Mlarie　Wilson）合演一部以足球賽為背景的喜劇（Lighthorse　Harry）（華納新片）後，滿想忘掉一切，返別墅度過假期，不料沒多天便接到公司的促駕電，呌他立刻回去工作，他懊喪地說在下次要學埃洛爾弗　林（Errol　Flynn）的妙法，駕駛一隻帆船外遊，這樣可漂泊不定，公司裹就無從催促了。</p>

<p>可是東北的風雲起了，在國內普遍激盪起一種怒潮，神怪武俠的影片立刻被認為含有毒素的東西，遭受到輿論方面嚴重的指摘，我的腦筋因無形的譴責而淸醒過來，事實上不容許我再演這一類麻醉觀衆神經的影片，於是我開始審愼起來，對於影片的題材如果不違背時代我纔接受。但不幸「一二八」事變接踵而起，脆弱的中國電影事業經不起摧殘而完全陷於停頓，使我也徬徨了一些時候。不過這樣一來倒無異是給予混亂的電影界以一個當頭棒喝，待電影事業逐漸復興起來之後，各公司的出品大都已改變了作風，而我也獲得了重為電影服務的機會，加入了藝華影業公司，改了現在這個名字，先後主演了「中國海的怒潮」「逃亡」兩部片子，開始以新的面目與觀衆相見，這時我纔對於我的工作表現漸感愜意。</p>
<p>藝華在初創時，充滿着一股朝氣，所有出品頗能為國產電影揚眉吐氣，但不幸因為外來的壓迫，以及國事的日非，最後竟也不得不走上消極的道路，我為了合同的束縛，先後主演了「花燭之夜」「化身姑娘」等幾部近於低級趣味的片子，內容與「中國海的怒潮」「逃亡」站在絕對相反的地位，而終於沒有獲得好評。</p>
<p>「八一三」的砲聲又響了！給貧乏的中國電影事業劃上了一條深刻的創痕，一切陷於停頓。</p>
<p>後來張善現先生首先以最大的毅力恢復了新華影業公司，邀我加入新華陣綫，最初我以在香港攝製的「女少爺」一片作為我為新華效勞的第一部作品，雖然這也是一部軟性的電影，但較為差强人意的是片子的本質上還沒有什麼毒素，不過我總希望以後不再在這一類的影片中出現。直到現在，我的願望終於獲得實現，現在我正從事於「亡命之徒」的導演工作，同時我叉兼任主演，「亡命之徒」的叙事正針對着當前的現實的社會，在片中演出一個隨處可以見到的血淚的故事，一個靑年工人不顧一切地犧牲一己拯救一個妓女的故事。我自信這劇本還不怎樣壞。</p>
<p>祇是我的能力有限，而導演工作叉是第一决嘗試，心裹未免有些虛怯，也許在「成績」方面未能盡如人意，不過我總還是盡了我所有的力量去做，成功與失敗，那祇好「在所不計」，作為另一問題了。</p>

<p>前幾天的天氣，老是那麼在風驟雨，令人十分悶氣，到黃金去聽了言菊朋一齣白帝城，那曉得煩悶愈增，竟然生起病來，一病三日，百無聊賴，隨手拖羞一本東坡奏議，其中有一段，我覺得，和我們與論界之多少有點關係，且把它寫在下面：</p>
<p>自建隆以來，未嘗罪一言者，（中略）言及乘輿，則天子改容，事聞廊廟，則宰相待罪，故仁宗之世，議者譏宰相，但奉行台諫風旨而已，聖人深意，流俗豈知，台諫固未必皆賢，所言亦未必皆是，然須養其銳氣崦惜之重權者，豈徒然哉！</p>
<p>上面所說的台諫，無疑地是代表民衆輿論的喉舌，不是同現在的報人有些相似嗎，我們看了上面一節記載，可以想見那時代的言論，可算是自由極了。當我息影虞山的時候（八一三之前一二年），也會撰過好幾篇議論政治經濟的稿子，有些預策，不幸現在都應騐了，有些記載當地貪官污吏的史實，自己也還覺得痛快，但這些稿子，結果自己都把它燒了。我以為於其諂媚權貴，寗願　媚天真的女孩子，與其寫言不由哀的偉大文章，寗願寫暢所欲言的游戲文章。這些話，因為有一位長者在勸我，說我有一位親戚，前些年常常寫些趨時的經濟政治文章，後來居然闊了，現在已是眼高於預，你有這些功夫寫舞稿，倒不如也玩玩那一套，還許能博得個做官發財的機會，但是我這個笨人，那能幹這種聰明事呢，所以與其弄巧，母寗藏拙了</p>
<p>跳舞不過是游藝界的一部份，比起全社會事業來，更是滄海一粟，不過單就上海一隅而論，生活於此者，實不下數萬人（包括各從業者家庭而言），游息於此者，叉不下數萬人，所以這個問題，說小倒也不能算小，我們旣然負着代表民衆喉舌的使命，對於這許多人，當然負一種相當責任。當我們寫舞稿的時候，第一耍用善意去覜察，善意去批判，不要肆意識誚。第二要用正義來立言，明白剖晰出賺錢和化錢的變方應守的範圍，和應享應盡的權義，再耍指陳些越範的惡果，第三……，說不盡許多了。</p>

<p>據我們的笨想，大凡許多人聚會在一個塲合的時候，向來秩序最不易維持，就拿茶館酒肆戲園子一齊來說罷，大家都是花錢取樂，冀圖一飽眼耳口鼻之福，務使各人的精神可以儘量發洩愉快。所以像茶館中之高談關論，酒肆裹的呼么喝二，以及戲館子裹的鼓掌呌好，這在在都表示一種紊亂喧鬧的情狀，戲館中當角兒在台上唱作的時候，縱令唱得再不好，可是只耍不間斷，那未，秩序就不會怎樣大亂的。單怕塲上一冷下來，祇聽鑼鼓響，並不瞧見一個人，那時台下就要起哄了。從前余三勝（叔岩祖）與名靑衣胡喜綠合演「探母」，是日喜祿以事誤塲，管事先生請老余「馬後」於是三勝竟運唱六七十個「我好比，」直至喜綠至時方止。叉凡値上一劇已完，而下一劇接不上時，中間例必由小花臉墊「逛燈」「請醫」諸小戲，藉以稍緩時間，但無論如何，決不使中途剪鑼或塲上停止動作也。</p>

<h3 id="e1">After the Abolition of the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty, the United States Considers Further Measures: Restricting Imports of Japanese Gold, Silver, and Goods, Determining Actions Based on the Development of the Far Eastern Situation <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) The United States' action to abolish the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty has clearly defined the U.S. position in the Far East. How U.S.-Japan relations will change in the future depends entirely on Japan's attitude and its actions in the Far East. Government and diplomatic circles expect Japan to take some kind of economic retaliation. If Japan truly retaliates, the United States has long-prepared plans to counter Japan and to avenge the humiliation the U.S. rights and Americans in China have repeatedly suffered. (American Associated Press dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Washington) After the announcement of the abolition of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, Secretary of State Hull issued a statement saying that the State Department will closely monitor the Far Eastern situation until the expiration of the treaty at the end of January next year in order to consider the situation and decide on a course of action. Several reporters asked whether the U.S. government intends to start negotiations with Japan to conclude a new commercial treaty. He replied that the State Department will maintain a wait-and-see attitude for six months. Another reporter asked about the conversation between U.S. Chargé d'Affaires Dooman and the Director of the American Bureau of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, Yoshizawa. He replied that there were no results. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Washington) U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau stated today that since the State Department announced the abolition of the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty yesterday, the Treasury Department will reconsider the issue of purchasing Japanese gold and silver and increasing import tariffs on Japanese cotton cloth in order to counter the export subsidies granted by the Japanese government. It is reported that if the United States stops purchasing Japanese gold and silver, it will deal a major blow to Japan, as Japan has sold gold worth US$415,000,000 and silver worth US$4,000,000 to the United States in the past two years. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Sources close to the government here recently stated that the Treasury Department will take measures against Japanese imported goods that compete with American goods through dumping, and will focus on restricting imports of Japanese cotton textiles. After the expiration of the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty on January 26 next year, the following measures may be implemented sequentially: (1) Increase harbor taxes for Japanese ships docking in American ports; (2) Restrict the entry of Japanese goods salesmen into the United States; (3) Prohibit the shipment of arms and military supplies to Japan. All of these will depend on how Japan deals with American interests in China, as well as the U.S. public opinion and the determination of the Senate to take action. As far as the Senate is concerned, since the establishment of the initial Anglo-Japanese agreement, there is deep concern that it will cause adverse effects, coupled with the fact that American interests in China are still being harmed, so the attitude has become tougher. Secretary of State Hull said two days ago that the State Department's attitude had not changed and even asked Republican Senator Vandenberg to postpone the abolition proposal until the next session of Congress. The sudden decision to abolish the treaty yesterday was due to the hardening attitude of the Senate. American political figures have had a good reaction to the abolition of the treaty. People in the State Department said that the government had long intended to implement a tough policy towards Japan, but was particularly afraid that public opinion would not fully support it, so it was not implemented until yesterday. Republicans believe that the abolition proposal was initiated by Republican Senator Vandenberg, and they feel satisfied with the party's victory. In short, the Democratic and Republican parties have now become united. The State Department's diplomatic actions in the Far East will be facilitated, and the impact will be that it will be easier to take action in Europe as well. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull declared yesterday that since the 1911 U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation was announced to be abolished this Wednesday, if the two countries want to conclude a new treaty, they must first eliminate political differences. Hull was unwilling to explain the content of the note to Japan, saying only that the note stated that the signing of a new treaty would be determined by the results of careful research. After careful consideration, the U.S. government is certain that "some provisions of the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty urgently need to be re-examined." According to his tone, the Japanese government must attach importance to American interests in China. It is said that officials in Washington believe that the Japanese discrimination against Americans in China has long violated the spirit of the treaty. According to Hull, the treaty will not expire for another six months, so what developments may occur within these six months that can make the negotiation of a new commercial treaty clear and definite. All parties believe that Hull's remarks were made in response to the intimidation from Tokyo. Yesterday, Japanese officials said they would continue to take other actions against American interests in China. Secretary of State Hull also said that he did not know anything about the Treasury Department's discussion of increasing tariffs on Japanese goods. (According to reports, since the United States increased tariffs on German goods, German trade with the United States has almost been reduced to zero.) Treasury Secretary Morgenthau told reporters that he would study the import of Japanese gold, silver, and goods into the United States based on the abolition of the treaty. As for whether Morgenthau consulted with Secretary of State Hull before the U.S. notified the abolition of the treaty, it was not clearly revealed. However, according to sources in official circles, the two giants did consult beforehand, and the Treasury Department is now certain that the prices of Japanese goods sold in the United States are much lower than those in Japan. Also, between 1937 and 1938, Japan imported US$415 million worth of gold and US$4 million worth of silver into the United States. Therefore, public opinion has fiercely criticized the United States for providing foreign exchange to Japan and enabling Japan to use it to purchase arms. The Wednesday note of abolition was personally delivered to Japanese Ambassador Horinouchi by U.S. Under Secretary of State Welles. Although this may have been accidental, observers here believe that it has great significance. Welles's order to be transferred as Commissioner to the Philippines was only announced a few hours earlier, and the U.S. Philippine Islands are the target of Japan's southward advance. Since the abolition of the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty, the embargo on arms and other retaliatory actions have become legal. In the past, many people in the U.S. Congress believed that the embargo on arms would damage the spirit of the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty. This decision to abolish the treaty also happened at a time when the United States was greatly expanding its military. Although the reason why the U.S. government strengthened its naval and air forces in the Pacific has not been officially announced, this state of defense is a natural result of U.S.-Japan friction. Republican Senator Borah, the former Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, had repeatedly expressed his opposition to sanctions against Japan because they violated the spirit of the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty, but last night, after the commercial treaty was abolished, he also expressed his support. Borah said, "When the time is ripe in the future and there is an opportunity to ban the export of arms to Japan, I will definitely express my support for it, the same as my past attitude towards other belligerent countries (regardless of whether those countries have declared war). In short, supplying arms to neutral or belligerent countries is not only morally wrong, but also enough to involve the United States in the whirlpool of war." Diplomats here were surprised by President Roosevelt's adoption of a tough diplomatic policy and the sudden announcement of the abolition of the treaty. It is said that Roosevelt's plan is quite extensive in nature, and what has already been implemented is as follows: (1) Suddenly abolishing the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty, causing an unexpected blow to Japan; (2) The President made a peace appeal to Hitler and Mussolini in March of this year; (3) The President suddenly transferred the U.S. fleet back to the Pacific; (4) In January of this year, the President sent a letter to the Senate and House of Representatives, threatening to impose practical sanctions on all aggressor countries. All parties firmly believe that the treaty abolition incident on Wednesday was aimed at sanctions. (American Associated Press dispatch, 28th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) All sectors of Japan were greatly shaken by the United States' sudden abandonment of the 1911 U.S.-Japan commercial treaty, which is now becoming more and more apparent. It is said that Foreign Minister Arita told a delegation from the House of Peers that he believed the United States' actions were related to protecting its interests in China. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The last words of the Japanese Foreign Ministry's midnight statement were, "If the U.S. government wants to conclude a new treaty with Japan to adapt to the new situation in East Asia, the Japanese government will gladly do so." This morning, when the Foreign Ministry hosted a press conference, a reporter raised this question, asking if it was a request. The spokesman replied that the new situation in East Asia naturally requires a new treaty. This is not a request, but an expectation. Currently, there are no plans to ask the United States to recognize the new situation in East Asia. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese Foreign Minister Arita reported to the Cabinet this morning on the U.S. government's notification of the abolition of the 1911 U.S.-Japan commercial treaty. According to reliable sources, the Japanese government will observe the development of the situation with a calm attitude. The government has formulated a policy to deal with the situation arising from the abolition of the treaty by the United States or other countries. The government does not intend to initiate a new treaty with the United States, but will adopt a wait-and-see policy. "Chugai Business News" stated that whether U.S.-Japan relations will be peaceful in the future depends entirely on the future actions of the U.S. government. The Japanese government and public should pay attention to the future actions of the U.S. government and formulate specific domestic and foreign policies to deal with emergencies. "Kokumin Shimbun" stated that the United States' abolition of the commercial treaty with Japan will not have a serious impact on Japan's overseas trade. However, the U.S. foreign policy after the abolition of the treaty should arouse Japan's preparation and determination. If the United States believes that the abolition of the treaty is enough to protect its rights in China, then its foolishness is beyond reach. "Asahi Shimbun" said that the United States' move provides Japan with the best opportunity to adjust its relations with the United States. Since the new situation in China has led to the adjustment of Anglo-Japanese relations, U.S.-Japan relations should also be adjusted. The government should take advantage of the United States' abolition of the treaty to find ways to conclude a new treaty with the United States to adapt to the new situation in East Asia. "Hochi Shimbun" advised the Japanese government to maintain calm, ascertain the motives of the United States, and pay attention to the various developments in the international situation after the United States' move. However, it must not abandon its existing position and must firmly carry out the construction of a new order in East Asia. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After the U.S. government announced the abolition of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, the Japanese Foreign Ministry immediately released a statement from the Director of the Information Department at 00:00 on the 28th, explaining the Japanese government's views on this issue. The content of the statement is as follows:</p>
<p>The U.S. government formally notified the Japanese government of the abolition of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. However, the incident was sudden, and the reasons were simple. The U.S. intentions are unknown. According to the U.S. statement, the reason for the abolition of the treaty is that the U.S. government has studied whether it is necessary to change the commercial treaties concluded by the United States with various foreign countries in recent years. The result is the conclusion that the current U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation contains some clauses that need to be reconsidered. The U.S. government decided to abolish the current treaty in order to arrange for this consideration and to deal with new situations to protect U.S. interests. However, this reason of the U.S. government can also be a reason for revising the treaty. It has not been able to explain the reason why it had to suddenly notify the abolition. Although the U.S. government said that this decision to notify is not related to the issue of Republican Senator Vandenberg's proposal to abolish the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the U.S. move is easy to make people generally think that it must have a major political significance at a time when the United Kingdom and Japan are negotiating the Tianjin case in Tokyo. New situations are developing in the Far East with great momentum. The Japanese government has long hoped that all countries in the world will increase their proper understanding of this fact. If the U.S. government hopes to conclude a new treaty with Japan in response to this new situation in the Far East, the Japanese government is happy to prepare to respond to this hope, needless to say.

<p>(Washington) Regarding the U.S. government's sudden abolition of the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty, members of Congress, including isolationists, unanimously praised it. Newspapers also unanimously expressed their support for Roosevelt's decisive measures. Political figures expect that the abolition of the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty is the first step in the United States' adoption of a more active Far East policy. After Congress reconvenes early next year, a ban on arms exports to Japan may be announced. This proposal was put forward by Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in the last Congress, but due to the existence of the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty, the discussion was postponed. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(New York) The morning newspapers here recently commented on the U.S. government's abolition of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, all of which were very satisfied, saying that this is the most important expression of the United States' encouragement of China's resistance to Japan since the outbreak of the Far East War, and the United States does not allow consideration of its subsequent impact. "The New York Times" stated, "The U.S. government's decision to take this action is very appropriate. At this critical juncture, the U.S. government's clear statement of its traditional policy towards the Far East is to enhance the strength of this policy. This action provides moral assistance to China. If the British government can adopt a stronger policy towards Japan, it will not be afraid that others will not support it. The United Kingdom and Japan are conducting negotiations in Tokyo. Japan intends to ask the United Kingdom to close the Yunnan-Burma Road to cut off China's supplies and thus achieve a major diplomatic victory. Now that the U.S. government has announced the abolition of the treaty, the position of the United Kingdom has naturally been strengthened. This action by the U.S. government is tantamount to issuing a statement to the Japanese government that our country, having undertaken the obligations of the Nine-Power Treaty, must recognize China's territorial and administrative integrity, sovereignty, and independence, and is prepared to use all its power, except resorting to war, so that China's territorial and administrative integrity, sovereignty, and independence are respected by everyone. The Japanese government also has no reason to doubt the firm support of the majority of the American people for the State Department's actions." "The New York Post" stated that American public opinion has no intention of "colluding with" Japan's murderous adventures, nor is it prepared to accept Japan's "beautiful Dunbarton" and sever diplomatic relations with it. Therefore, the abolition of the commercial treaty is the only correct way. Judging from the reaction in Tokyo, the Japanese military seems to be taking retaliatory measures in a short period of time. If so, the State Department authorities will have no time to draft a new commercial treaty. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The article in "The Washington Star" is sufficient to represent the reaction of American public opinion. It said, "The government's move will definitely be supported by the people of the country. American rights have been despised and protested repeatedly, but to no avail. The United States has shown extraordinary patience for two years. However, our citizens have been attacked repeatedly, and our legal rights based on treaties have been violated repeatedly. All of this should not be tolerated any longer. Even the fanatical warlords who hold power in Japan know this. In short, our patience has reached its limit." (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3 id="e4">British and American Far East Policies Proceed Along Parallel Lines: Britain May Follow the United States' Lead and Announce the Abolition of the Commercial Treaty with Japan <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(London) According to information obtained by Reuters diplomatic correspondents, many people in the United Kingdom believe that the timing of the United States' abolition of the commercial treaty with Japan may have been chosen suddenly, but it is not entirely accurate to say that this is a surprising move, as this move indicates that British and American Far East policies are now proceeding along parallel lines, but the two governments have not attempted to mutually bind each other. This move by the United States has naturally caused all sectors of the United Kingdom to shift their thinking to consider the use of this method to protect their rights in the Far East, as the United Kingdom also concluded a commercial treaty with Japan in 1911. The United Kingdom certainly does not intend to hinder the success of the Tokyo talks, but if it feels it is necessary to emulate the United States in order to provide greater protection for British interests, the United Kingdom will also consider abolishing the Anglo-Japanese commercial treaty.

<p>(London) "The News Chronicle" commented today that President Roosevelt's measures in foreign policy have always been firm and often exciting, but none have been as great as this abolition of the commercial treaty with Japan. Whether this move results in an arms embargo or not, this abolition note is the most important political condemnation imposed on Japan, and it also provides timely encouragement to China, which is slightly troubled by Anglo-Japanese compromise. Whether President Roosevelt intended to do so or not, his abolition of the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty has given the British government a practical lesson in Far East policy. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(London) The Manchester Guardian's editorial today stated that President Roosevelt's decision to abolish the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty is a warning that the United States will take more severe action. If the current situation continues, the American people will demand a halt to supplies to Japan, and without this supply, Japan will not be able to carry out its aggression against China. The Birmingham Post emphasized the indirect beneficial impact of the U.S. move on the Anglo-Japanese talks in Tokyo, saying that the United Kingdom and the United States have obviously not yet acted in unison on Far East issues, but their steps are now closer. The Times's diplomatic correspondent said that a study of the original text of the U.S. abolition note shows that the Japanese military is destroying the spirit of the U.S.-Japan treaty. The 1911 Anglo-Japanese treaty is indeed similar to the U.S.-Japan treaty in many ways. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(London) "The Daily Telegraph" editorial today asked that President Roosevelt, with his sudden decision to abolish the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty, has shown the world that a democratic country can sometimes deal with an omnipotent country in unexpected strategies. The United States' move is only exercising the rights granted by the treaty, which is very different from Japan's past seven years of brazenly destroying any treaty obligations that conflict with its policies. Japan not only violates treaty obligations, but also seeks to evade the inconveniences that belligerent countries should have in law by avoiding a formal declaration of war against China, while at the same time demanding the conveniences that belligerent countries can have, as evidenced by the negotiations on the Tianjin issue. President Roosevelt's move will be a powerful warning that Japan cannot continue to take advantage of opportunities or destroy the rights of other countries without incurring early retaliation. If our observation is not wrong, then the time is gradually approaching when the United States will have to abandon its previous tolerant attitude when it encounters this new development.

<h3 id="e7">Capital Recovery Movement <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai financial market can be described as having exhausted the possibilities of extreme change! The volatile hearts of the people, after such repeated shocks, turn pale at the mention of a tiger, and rumors flourish. Originally intended to restrict withdrawals and tighten up cash, it unexpectedly promoted cash withdrawals and soaring discounts. Originally intending to tighten foreign exchange and prevent leaks, it unexpectedly made foreign currency expensive and gold rise. All of this backfired because the changes were too sudden, and the evolution was like rumors, so that the psychology of panic could not be controlled by reason. To say that this is the trouble of mediocre people is also due to the facts; to say that this is disregarding the overall situation, how can one know that it is not done for good? In short, merely blaming is not enough to solve the problem.</p>
<p>However, to invest in foreign exchange, buy gold, hoard cash, and transfer deposits to foreign banks, is it ultimately the safest way for our capital, or the most profitable way to handle it? Everyone knows that it is not entirely true. Because foreign exchange today has reached its extreme point, the value of one legal tender is only about four pennies, and the cost of one British pound is 56 legal tender, which has not been seen since the mutual trade between China and the West. From now on, will the price of British exchange shrink to three pennies, two pennies, or even one penny? If this is the case, then the price of currency will fall and the price of goods will rise. At that time, will the currency used be foreign exchange or legal tender? If it is still legal tender, then the benefits obtained will be very limited. Moreover, even without the support of foreigners, the value of legal tender will never fall again and again, even below four or three pennies. President Chiang Kai-shek once stated responsibly at the joint memorial week of the Central National Government on the 24th of this month, saying: "The government will definitely maintain the value of legal tender with all its strength, and will definitely maintain the ratio of legal tender to foreign exchange as much as possible. This is not a problem." From this, we can know that the value of legal tender will never fall again. Even if there are occasional changes in the black market, it will not damage the legal tender in the slightest.</p>
<p>As for the value of gold, it changes with foreign exchange. If the foreign exchange rate does not change, the price of gold will be stable. As for depositing in foreign banks, it is indeed true that they can deposit and withdraw cash without restrictions. If it is said that it has other guarantees, it is not necessarily true. Because those who deposit legal tender pay legal tender. If legal tender is worthless, then what is deposited in foreign banks will also be lost. And to allow cash to flow into the vaults of foreign banks, expanding their power to control the financial market, and destroying the decades of hard work of Chinese banks, is it not a pity? It is important to know that "the use of legal tender in the occupied areas has been fully prepared and will be firmly maintained, so as not to affect the livelihood of our people in the slightest, and not to cause our compatriots any loss," President Chiang Kai-shek has solemnly stated. Then, what doubts and fears can there be about the future of legal tender? Moreover, after several cash withdrawals, the strength of Chinese banks can also be tested. In the past two months, there has been a rush to withdraw cash, which is a fact that cannot be denied. However, Chinese banks can cope with it with ease, and there is absolutely no sign of being stretched. If they were not well prepared at ordinary times, how could they cope with this tense situation?</p>
<p>From this point of view, do not rely on foreign forces as reliable, and do not regard capital flight as reliable. Those who value reality have no long-term plans, and their high hats block their vision, which is similar to frogs at the bottom of a well. Do they really love us deeply? They only love our wealth. When the wealth is exhausted, they will also leave hopefully. As for those who become rich through speculation, they should hold their huge wealth as a small depositor in the wall street, but this situation is also difficult to last. If they have tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of capital, considering their monthly income, it is not as good as a beggar in New York. Why are they so eager to escape? It is important to know that the survival of the future depends entirely on self-reliance; even the economic recovery also depends on self-reliance; without self-reliance, how can there be other power? If Britain continues to help us with foreign exchange, it is good, but even if it does not, we can only do our best to preserve the existing foreign exchange and generate future foreign exchange. However, what is closely related to this is our own financial problem. Finance is the mother of all businesses; a sound financial organization, solid credit, and the ability to fulfill its proper functions and not be manipulated by speculation are more than enough to develop industry and commerce and maintain society. If a huge amount of cash is deposited in foreign banks and invested in unproductive foreign currency and gold, it will not only increase the strength of foreign banks, but also drastically reduce the active capital of Chinese banks, which will inevitably hinder the financing and turnover of industry and commerce, leading to the decline of industry, the withering of finance, and the arrival of a general collapse and great panic. Who can be outside this circle? Therefore, only by allowing the financial sector to develop its original functions can the safety of capital be ensured. What we hope from the financial sector is that its every move, small enough to affect industry and commerce, and large enough to affect society, should be cautious beforehand, and meticulous afterwards. Do not take it lightly, and do not be too hasty. Any actions that can increase the trust of depositors are expected to be faithfully implemented; even for customers' improper uses, measures should be taken to restrict them. Profit is indeed valued by the financial sector, but we hope that it will take righteousness as profit, and take great profit and long-term profit as profit, and not take temporary small profit as profit.</p>
<p>What is hoped from the public is that, for the foreign currency and gold purchased and stored, how much higher can the future market price be than this? Why not calculate it? Which is more, when it is high or when it is low? If the market price in the future is better than it is today, then the gains will be abundant, but the risks will also be greater! Also, for the cash stored, do you hope to generate interest, or do you hope to be sealed waste paper? If money loses its circulation, its effectiveness is lost. However, the reason for hoarding cash is probably the inevitable consequence of changing the "August 13" stabilization of financial measures. From this, we can know that the credit of the financial sector cannot be neglected. A team of four horses cannot catch the tongue; how can one retract it again and again? Therefore, for the sake of the financial sector, there should be no more restrictions on withdrawals! For the sake of the general public, it is necessary to gather all its strength to deal with this extraordinary situation, and should not weaken the strength of the financial sector and hinder the survival in the struggle process. Understanding this, then returning the capital to the vaults of Chinese banks, so that it can fulfill its monetary functions and provide for the operation of the financial sector and the development of the industrial and commercial sectors, is indeed the way of economic self-reliance.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Foreign Minister Wang Praises America's Sense of Justice As A Manifestation of Willingness to Maintain Prestige Regarding the Abolition of the US-Japan Treaty; Further Active Steps Could Restore International Order <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Foreign Minister Wang, regarding the United States' announcement of the abolition of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce, made the following statement to foreign reporters on the 28th: The United States has always been known for its rich sense of justice, and China has a firm and unwavering belief in the American people. US Secretary of State Hull has now notified Japan that the provisions contained in the (1911) US-Japan Treaty of Commerce must be reconsidered, and that the treaty will be abolished after a six-month period. The US government's decision to do so shows that it must have fully considered the (great disorder in East Asia) caused by the Japanese warlords in politics and commerce. The announcement of this abolition can be regarded as an expression of the United States' willingness to maintain its position and prestige in the Pacific region. If the United States takes more concrete and active steps, doing everything within its power to curb international chaos and restore international peace, mutual trust, and goodwill, then it will be what we sincerely pray for. In fact, the United States can implement its decisive power over the peace of the Far East and other parts of the world without engaging in war. If the United States' strength, prestige, and public opinion can be clearly expressed, it will benefit international justice, law, and order. (28th dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e9">US President's Decisive Action Praised by Chinese Government and People <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Since the wartime capital received the US government's announcement of the abolition of the 1911 US-Japan Treaty of Commerce, the Chinese government authorities and the people have generally regarded this as the initial step taken by the US government to express its extreme concern for the situation in the Far East. Since Japan implemented its invasion of China, all friendly nations have exercised the greatest patience and watched its development quietly. The United States and Britain have repeatedly given friendly advice to Japan, but it has not only turned a deaf ear, but also intensified its actions to infringe on the interests of friendly nations in China, becoming increasingly proactive. Its intention is to fundamentally overthrow the position of the United States and Britain in the Far East. Recently, the incidents of Japanese troops insulting and persecuting expatriates in the occupied areas are too numerous to mention. President Roosevelt seems to have keenly felt that the actions of the Japanese side cannot be persuaded by empty words. He had no choice but to take the measure of abolishing the treaty of commerce to urge them to reflect. The Americas are the largest customer for Japanese exports, accounting for almost 70% of its total export value. If the United States and Japan become treaty-less states, the great impact on Japanese exports is something that cannot be calculated with numbers. The collapse of its economic foundations is only a matter of time. Moreover, Japan's needed cotton, pig iron, steel, gasoline, timber, etc. will all be cut off from their sources. There is no doubt that its military actions will be severely affected. The Tokyo and Osaka stock markets have already experienced a crash, which can give us a glimpse of the wavering hearts of the people. Although the abolition of the treaty will take effect six months later, before it takes effect, the US president also has the power to increase the import tax rate on Japanese goods or ban their import. Therefore, the second and third steps taken by President Roosevelt after the abolition of the treaty are even more closely watched by the world. The Chinese government and people all admire President Roosevelt's high-minded understanding and decisive determination in taking such decisive measures. The blow Japan has suffered in the past two years has been the most significant with this decision. There is a good possibility that this will become a fatal blow. Judging from the attitude expressed by various major newspapers in Japan, advising their citizens to remain calm, it can be seen that their internal panic cannot be compared to ordinary events. (28th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Chinese Minister of Economic Affairs Weng Wenhao told the Associated Press today that the Chinese government is extremely satisfied with the United States' abolition of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce, considering it the beginning of actively confronting Japan. The significance of this action by the United States is extremely noteworthy. The entire situation in the Far East depends entirely on the attitude of the US government. We are well aware that Japan will discriminate against the rights and interests of third countries in the Far East. If action is not taken quickly, the disaster will become even greater and beyond repair. The United States must take the lead in a rational adjustment of international relations in the future, and take other measures in the same direction. After a good example is set, other countries can follow suit. Weng also believed that Britain would continue to assist China. (28th Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) All sectors of the Chinese people believe that the United States' abolition of the treaty of commerce and navigation with Japan will greatly enhance Britain's position at the Tokyo Conference. China is now hoping that Britain will take a tougher stance against Japan in the future. They also said that Britain may not take action beyond its vague declarations, which can be interpreted more broadly. Last night, people here were all discussing the news of the US's abolition of the treaty, with enthusiastic and pleasant emotions no less than when they received news of the victory at Taierzhuang in the past. This morning, all Chinese newspapers published this news in large characters, with headlines such as "Fatal Blow to Japan" and "New Shock in Tokyo." (28th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The United Daily News here commented today that the US's action to abolish the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce is enough to dispel China's ambiguity towards the United States since the postponement of the discussion on the US Neutrality Act. It is said that "Japan's munitions are supplied by the United States for the most part, but once the United States implements an arms embargo, it will be greatly hindered. An arms embargo is the most effective weapon to contain aggressors, and it will surely become the only weapon to maintain the Nine-Power Treaty and the League of Nations. The United States' action this time also clearly shows that the United States is always trying to fulfill its obligations under international treaties, and also shows that the United States is paying attention to the shift in the situation in the Far East. At the same time, this action by the United States has also formed the same front with other peace-loving countries, further demonstrating the potential power of the United States to stop aggressors, and is also a kind of economic retaliation against Japan, and also shows the United States' determination to maintain its position in the Far East and promote world peace. The US's decision this time is also a manifestation of the improvement of China's international relations, but it is also the result of China's determination to continue the war of resistance."

<p>(Tokyo) Today's British-Japanese round table conference convened for three hours and adjourned at 1:00 PM, with a decision to discuss it again on Monday morning. It is heard that the talks progressed smoothly today, and the discussion on monetary issues has been completed, but the nature of the decision is not yet known. The two sides then negotiated the handover of silver stored in the British concession in Tianjin and other matters. It is heard that yesterday morning's round table conference made considerable progress on maintaining peace and order in the British concession in Tianjin. However, the six-hour meeting in the afternoon failed to reach an agreement on the Japanese side's proposal to ban the circulation of legal tender in the concession. It is heard that during the meeting, the Japanese representative stated that the continued circulation of Chinese legal tender in the concession was the cause of economic disorder in North China, and the British side should strictly prohibit its circulation in accordance with the purpose of the Arita-Craigie agreement. However, the attitude of the British representative was the opposite, saying that the British government naturally supports the legal tender issued by the Chinese government, and as long as Britain continues to recognize the Chinese government, Britain will never agree to ban the use of legal tender. (28th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today's Japanese newspapers' reports on the Tokyo British-Japanese conference are contrary to the official statement that the conference is progressing smoothly in a friendly atmosphere. According to the newspapers, the British-Japanese conference has stalled due to Japan's demand that the British concession in Tianjin ban the circulation of Chinese legal tender and hand over the cash stored in various Chinese banks in the British concession. It is heard that although the US representative admitted that the Bank of Communications had silver worth 14 million yuan, it would not be handed over soon. The Japanese side then cited the Arita-Craigie agreement, demanding that the cash stored in the four banks of China, Communications, Agriculture, and Industry in the British concession in Tianjin be handed over to the "Provisional Government" of Peiping. The opinions of the two sides are very different. (28th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>(Berlin) Regarding the United States' announcement of the abolition of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce, political figures here believe that it is a political action. The newspapers in Berlin last night generally claimed that the purpose of this move by the United States was to help Britain, and at the same time believed that the United States would soon ban the shipment of munitions to Japan. The "Financial News" published an article titled "Sanctions War on the Pacific," stating that most US newspapers had long advocated a tough stance against Japan, and that President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull had implemented it without waiting for the Senate's discussion in order to avoid Washington being drawn into "Britain's failure in the Far East." The newspaper believed that after the abolition of the Treaty of Commerce, the United States would follow up with an announcement of an embargo on munitions to Japan, which would have a significant impact on Japan, as 57% of all Japanese munitions currently come from the United States. The "Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" also published an editorial, vigorously arguing that this move was the first result of British-American cooperation in the Far East. The newspaper stated that Britain has now retreated to Singapore in the Far East, and its position is largely dependent on assistance. The real motive for the United States to abolish the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce is to reverse the failure in Tianjin, but the newspaper believes that Japan will also take tough measures to resist it.

<p>(Rome) After the US government abolished the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce, Italian political figures felt extremely interested in the impact of this move on the future of the Far East, and said that this was the prelude to the US implementing tariff policies against Japan. Originally, the Japanese economy, especially the raw materials needed for industrial production, such as cotton, iron, and oil, were almost entirely dependent on US supply, and it would inevitably suffer a serious impact. It can be seen that the US measures are completely based on political considerations, that is, the authorities of that country want to exert pressure on the Japanese government.

According to news received by the Chinese side, Japanese cavalry artillery units and mechanized units have begun to advance westward from Minggang, 40 kilometers north of Xinyang, with a view to attacking Gushi in the southwest.

One route went straight to Wagang (west of Minggang) to harass Biyang, and another route slanted towards Maoji (southwest of Minggang) to flank Biyang. The Chinese army has separately met them.

<p>(Kunming) Yunnan Chairman Long Yun told a Reuters reporter today that the Chinese government and people were both surprised and disappointed by the British signing of the Tokyo Memorandum. We have always regarded Britain as a party to maintaining justice, international law, and fairness. It is truly incomprehensible why it suddenly changed its attitude and complied with Japan's demands. It should be known that those who are adversely affected by it are not only limited to the Far East, but will also extend to the peace of the whole world. However, we are not completely disappointed by this preliminary compromise, because the final intention of the British people is still unknown. It is hoped that the good consciousness of the British people will have its own expression. This action of Britain will naturally have some psychological impact, which no one can deny. However, the determination of the Chinese government to resist will not be shaken in the slightest. We have a responsibility to defend our land. It would be good to obtain the assistance of friendly countries, but we must continue to struggle. Long also solemnly stated that the Japanese's baseless radio broadcasts, saying that the Yunnan Province and the Central Government have differences of opinion, are absolutely unfounded. The Yunnan Province not only fully supports the Central Government, but also remains loyal to the Central Government. Even before the country was unified, the Yunnan Province had expressed its support for Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. At that time, I did my best to persuade other leaders to support Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Since that was the case at that time, there is absolutely no reason not to support him now.

<h3 id="e19">Japanese Veteran Statesman Advises Countrymen Must Change Their Views on China - Yukio Ozaki Publishes Essay - Continuing This Way Will Inevitably Lead to a Deep Recession <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Yukio Ozaki is a veteran statesman in Japan who advocates parliamentary politics and liberalism. Since Japan wanted to establish a parliamentary system, he has been elected as a member of the House of Representatives in every election without competition, and has also served as a member of the cabinet. During the era of party politics, the Japanese people hailed him as the "God of Constitutionalism." This old man, who is over eighty years old, has been very indignant about the dictatorship of the warlords in recent years. Whenever he has the opportunity, he tells his countrymen his views. Recently, Ozaki published an article in the July issue of "Japan Review" entitled "Policies Towards China and Europe," offering earnest advice to his country in light of the current situation. The full text is quite long, but unfortunately most of it has been censored and deducted by the military, and it is impossible to see the whole picture. Judging from the remaining part, Ozaki cited the expeditions of Chinese troops in the Yuan and Ming dynasties, saying that even the most powerful generals of that time were unable to subdue the Chinese troops, which shows that strength and weakness, prosperity and decline, are only temporary phenomena and not permanent. Today, although China is weak, it will eventually become strong, warning his countrymen that they must change their views on China. He also said that Japan has no inherent culture, and all Chinese characters come from China. The Japanese language has many homophones with different meanings. Without Chinese characters, there is no hope for the development of academics and everything else. He also cited evidence, saying that the elements of nation-building, "benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, and filial piety," cannot be expressed with appropriate language without using Chinese characters. Even agricultural tools, sericulture, and textiles were all transmitted from China. Therefore, Japan owes a great deal to China, and his hints are very sharp. He also said that this year's budget is close to 10 billion yuan. When using borrowed money, the market naturally looks prosperous, but debts must be repaid, and repayment is naturally more painful than use. The Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War in the past both led to extremely deep recessions after the war, which can serve as a warning. Yuan troops went on an expedition and encountered a storm, and the entire army was wiped out. This was God's blessing. The Russo-Japanese War ended due to internal strife in Imperial Russia and the mediation of the US president. Moreover, the war expenses used at that time were all borrowed from Jewish people ("pointing to the Jewish capitalists of the United States"), so there was not much worry. The situation is very different today. If we continue to move forward in this way, there will be almost no end date. The lines fully express his sincere concern for the country. Finally, Ozaki also discussed the situation in Europe, but because it was all deleted, there is no way to know its general meaning. From this, it can be seen that Japanese politicians with foresight are very worried about their country's future, and at the same time, their understanding of China is diametrically opposed to that of their military. Under heavy pressure, Ozaki still dared to express his views on his conscience, which is truly commendable, and the Japanese people, who have been deceived by their military, will inevitably have deep feelings and reflection.

<p>(Tientsin) British residents in Tientsin who reside in areas under Japanese influence have recently received a mailed notice from the Anti-British National Salvation Association, advising the British to leave Tientsin quickly to save their lives. The notice stated, "You must know that the era of the British Empire's long history of aggression is now completely collapsing.

<p>(Hong Kong) Tientsin news. On the 24th, Japanese troops in Tangku instigated over a thousand vagrant ruffians to hold an anti-British rally. In the meeting place, a villain suddenly shouted the slogan "Down with France." The vagrants immediately flocked to the gate of the French barracks in Tangku. After the French soldiers defended, the two sides were deadlocked for a long time. The Tientsin French garrison authorities, upon hearing the news, dispatched troops to rush to the scene and dispersed them. It has been found that the Japanese side initially targeted both the British and French sides regarding the Tientsin concession issue. Later, they focused solely on the British. Recently, due to British concessions, they are now targeting the French, employing a divide-and-conquer strategy. (Telegraph from the 28th)</p>

<p>(Peking) North China has been experiencing continuous torrential rain, and the river waters have risen significantly. Japanese military operations have been halted. Of the four railways departing from Peking, only the Peking-Mukden Railway is still operational. The other three are mostly submerged. The Yung-ting River near Peking has risen by ten feet, and the famous Marco Polo Bridge, where the war began, has been damaged by the water. Tung-chow, east of Peking, is six feet underwater. Hundreds of houses in Peking and its suburbs have collapsed, and several people have died. This situation has emboldened the guerrillas in the Peking area to fight even more vigorously. On Sunday, twenty miles northwest of Peking, they attacked a Japanese outpost, killing ninety Japanese soldiers. Subsequently, two hundred guerrillas advanced to the gates of Peking, abducting twenty-eight Chinese police employed by the Japanese authorities and wealthy Chinese residents to be held for ransom. By the time Japanese troops arrived, the guerrillas had already left. (Reuter's dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Tientsin) It is reported that the Japanese authorities have stated that ships sailing out will no longer need to dock at the Dairen pier for inspection. This is because the Hai River's water level has risen and the current is swift, making it difficult for ships to dock alongside the pier. The Jardine Matheson and Co.'s "Hsieh Hsing" (transliteration) and the Hai-k'ou vessels, which had departed from the Bund in the British concession today, reversed their course to the Dairen pier. After the inspection was completed, they were proceeding upstream. However, with their sterns still tied to the Bund in the British concession and before they could turn around, the cables suddenly snapped, preventing them from sailing out.

<p>(London) According to reports received by the British Foreign Office, North China has recently been hit by a series of storms, and the river waters have flooded, greatly hindering military operations. The Japanese are unable to utilize the four railways they occupy, except for the Peking-Mukden line, which is still passable. Chinese guerrillas took advantage of the flooding to attack Peking, engaging in battles with Japanese troops thirty-five miles northwest of Peking, and there are reports that they approached the gates of Peking.

<p>(London) The staff officers of the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union will begin talks in the near future. According to sources close to the War Office, the British government originally intended to appoint Air Chief Marshal Newall as the chief representative. However, because the issues to be discussed by the staff officers are complex and cannot be resolved in a short period of time, and Newall has important duties in Shanghai, making it inconvenient for him to remain abroad for a long time, it has been decided to appoint General Chatwode instead. He currently has no fixed duties and can stay in Moscow for a longer period of time. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 27th) (Paris) The representatives of the staff officers of the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union will hold talks in Moscow.

<p>(Berlin) It is widely rumored here that Aviation Minister and Plenipotentiary for the Four-Year Plan, General Göring, intends to obtain a large loan from abroad to transform the country's economic structure, shifting it from a wartime footing back to a peacetime one. It is also rumored that Propaganda Minister Goebbels and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop have expressed their opposition, leading to disagreements. To this day, the rift between the two sides has become increasingly apparent due to the fact that Walther, an advisor to the German Ministry of Economics, is conducting negotiations with British officials in London. According to reliable sources, Walther obtained Göring's consent to conduct an investigation in London on certain issues. Goebbels and Ribbentrop believe that Germany should not show weakness to the democracies, and that if Germany maintains a firm stance, Britain will eventually yield. Therefore, Goebbels instructed the newspapers to do their best to publicize, in order to make the German people believe that the British government's talks with Walther are proof that Britain is on its last legs and that Germany should adhere to its demands. Once these articles were published, hopes for a beneficial rapprochement between Germany and Britain were dashed. General Göring is extremely dissatisfied and has expressed his displeasure. It is likely that Führer Hitler will personally intervene to mediate. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 27th)</p>

At that time, Prime Minister Chamberlain will deliver an important speech on the Far East issue and the current negotiations between the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union. (Havas News Agency, 27th)</p>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons today that he will announce the date for the resumption of Parliament in the autumn next week. He intends to move that Parliament adjourn on August 2nd and, in accordance with custom, authorize the Speaker to convene Parliament earlier if necessary. Labour Party leader Greenwood asked whether the Prime Minister had considered the suggestion that the House of Commons should meet on schedule and that members should not be away for long. Chamberlain replied that although this suggestion had not been formally proposed, he had seen it in the newspapers. After considering it, he felt that this move was not appropriate, as it might cause nationwide anxiety. Liberal Party leader Sinclair said that there was a possibility of serious events occurring abroad, and that it was inappropriate for Parliament to adjourn for a long period of time at this time. Chamberlain replied that he believed the only reasonable course of action was for the government to monitor the development of events and exercise its functions with a sense of responsibility, which Parliament could rely on. Chamberlain continued to reply to Greenwood, saying that he did not want to be bound by a promise, but in a broad sense, if the government intended to make major changes to its foreign policy, he would consult with Parliament. Churchill asked whether the Prime Minister thought it would be appropriate to declare Parliament adjourned until October 25th if the German army mobilized in early August. Chamberlain replied that this was a hypothetical question. (Reuter's dispatch, 27th)</p>

<p>The Hague. The majority party in Parliament, the Catholic Party, and the Radical Party today proposed a motion of no confidence in Dr. Colijn's new government, which was then put to a vote and passed by a vote of fifty-five to twenty-seven.

After the vote, Parliament adjourned to allow the government to consider its position. It is expected that Colijn will submit his resignation. The Catholic Party leader, Taekes, proposed the motion of no confidence, arguing that the organization of the "business" cabinet violated the public interest because it did not rely on the majority of the lower house and violated the constitution. Prime Minister Colijn then rose to defend himself, saying that it did not conflict with the constitution and that, given the difficulty of the current financial situation, there was no other way. He stated that if Parliament could clearly express its views and indicate its willingness to provide a majority of people on which another cabinet could rely, he would resign.

<p>The Continental Daily News reports that the United States notified Japan on Wednesday of its decision to abolish the 1911 US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. This marks the death knell for the treaty, which has been in effect for 28 years, and it will be invalidated six months after the notification, on January 26, 1940. This sudden move by the United States, according to opinions gathered in Shanghai yesterday (the 27th), will bring about the complete termination of all formally recognized trade relations between the US and Japan. This situation is unparalleled, except for the period from 1919 to 1933 when the United States did not recognize the Soviet Union. The US-Japan Treaty of Commerce was signed in Washington, D.C., on February 21, 1911, during the presidency of William Howard Taft, by Secretary of State Philander C. Knox and Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Baron Uchida Kōsai. The US Senate amended and approved it on February 24. The US President and the Japanese Emperor ratified it successively on March 2 and March 31, and it was initialed in Tokyo on April 4 and announced the following day. The treaty includes the following eighteen articles: (1) Trade, travel, residence, and taxation; (2) Inviolability of residences; (3) Consular officials; (4) Freedom of mutual commerce and navigation; (5) Import and export duties; (6) Transit duties; (7) Companies; (8) Equality of shipping; (9) Privileges for ship docking and loading; (10) Nationality of ships; (11) Tonnage taxes; (12) Postal ships; (13) Coastal trade; (14) Most-favored-nation treatment; (15) Patents, trademarks, and designs; (16) Replacement of the 1894 conditions; (17) Effectiveness and duration; (18) Ratification.</p>
<p>Among these eighteen articles, the first, third, fourth, fifth, and fourteenth are most relevant to the current situation in the Far East. These four articles include the following provisions:</p>
<p>Article 1: Nationals of each contracting party shall have liberty to enter the territories of the other, to travel and reside therein, to carry on wholesale and retail trade, to own or lease and occupy houses, factories, warehouses and shops, to employ agents of their choice, to lease land for residential and commercial purposes, and generally to do anything incidental to or necessary for trade upon the same terms as native nationals, submitting to the local laws and regulations. They shall not be compelled to pay any taxes or duties other or higher than those paid by native nationals. Nationals of each contracting party shall, within the territory of the other, conform to the conditions imposed upon native nationals, and shall receive the most constant protection and security for their persons and property, and shall enjoy the same rights as native nationals, but shall be exempt from compulsory military service, whether in the army or navy, or in the regular army or national guard or militia, and from all contributions imposed in lieu of personal service, and from all compulsory loans or requisitions.</p>
<p>Article 3: Each contracting party may send to the other consuls-general, consuls, vice-consuls, and consular agents to reside in such parts, cities, and places of the other as may be agreed upon.

Any such government may also object to receive such officer if such officer be objectionable to it, but if such other party shall not object to receiving such officer, it shall not be treated less favorably than similar officers of other countries. Such consuls-general, consuls, vice-consuls, consular agents, and consular representatives, upon receiving exequaturs or other sufficient authorizations from the government of the country to which they are appointed, shall, on condition of reciprocity, have the right to exercise the functions and to enjoy the exemptions and immunities which are or may hereafter be granted to consular officers of like grade of the most favored nation. The government issuing such exequatur or other authorization reserves the right to cancel it in its discretion, but shall state to the other party the reasons for which it thought proper to do so.</p>
<p>Article 4: There shall be between the territories of the two contracting parties reciprocal freedom of commerce and navigation. The nationals of each, equally with those of the most favored nation, shall have liberty freely to come with their ships and cargoes to all places, ports and rivers of the other which are or may hereafter be opened to foreign commerce, subject always to the laws of the country to which they so come.</p>
<p>Article 5: No other or higher duties of customs, on the importation into the territories of either of the contracting parties of any article, the growth, produce, or manufacture of the territories of the other, than are or shall be payable on like articles of the growth, produce, or manufacture of any other foreign country. Nor shall any other or higher duties or charges be imposed in either country on the exportation of any article to the territories of the other, than such as are or shall thereafter be payable on the exportation of the like article to any other foreign country. Nor shall any prohibition be imposed by either country on the importation of any article from the territories of the other, which shall not equally extend to the importation of the like article from any other country. Nor shall any prohibition be imposed by either country on the exportation of any article to the territories of the other, which shall not equally extend to the exportation of the like article to any other country. But this provision shall not apply to prohibitions or restrictions maintained or imposed as sanitary measures or for purposes of protecting animals and useful plants.</p>
<p>Article 14: Except as otherwise expressly provided in this treaty, the high contracting parties agree that, in all that concerns commerce and navigation, any privilege, favor, or immunity which either high contracting party has actually granted, or may hereafter grant, to the citizens or subjects of any other state, shall be extended immediately and unconditionally to the citizens or subjects of the other high contracting party; it being their intent that the citizens or subjects of each high contracting party shall enjoy, in the territories of the other, treatment in all respects as favorable as that which is or may be granted to citizens or subjects of the most favored nation.</p>

The Japanese commander, Lieutenant Hozhou, was seriously wounded and died on the spot. The Tsuchiya unit was attacked by a company of Chinese troops in Mahu Mountain. There were also over sixty Chinese troops active in Ding Shanhe. Japanese troops passing through the area were often severely attacked. At the same time, Chinese troops were active in Changshanmen, Pengjiabu, the Third Cemetery, Lixi Lake, Wengjia Mountain, and other places. Therefore, the highest commander of the Japanese troops in Hangzhou considered Hangzhou to be the most active area for guerrilla warfare and has already transferred the cavalry to Jiaxing, with the headquarters following suit. The puppet pacification army of Xu Pucheng has been deployed to Hangzhou, with the headquarters located in the Bank of China building on Anpo Bridge.</p>
<p>Jiaxing Correspondence: Chinese troops in the suburbs of Xiashi have become increasingly active recently, leading to fierce battles in the surrounding villages in recent days. It is learned that at about 10 a.m. on the 26th, two Chinese soldiers, disguised as farmers, sailed a boat into the town from a certain place. When they docked at the pier, four Japanese soldiers happened to be patrolling the area. The two soldiers seized the opportunity to draw out wooden-cased pistols and ambush them, killing all four Japanese soldiers. They then captured the weapons and ammunition carried by the Japanese soldiers, boarded the boat, and safely retreated. Subsequently, the Japanese authorities in the town learned of the incident and, in addition to cremating the four corpses nearby, announced a special state of emergency and, together with the puppet police, conducted a house-to-house search in all four suburbs, but found nothing.</p>
<p>In Xieqiao Town, which belongs to Haiyan County, more than 100 Japanese soldiers recently (on the 25th) attacked the Chinese army positions in a certain area of the town's outskirts. The Chinese regular army stationed there, upon hearing the news, immediately ordered the soldiers to lie in ambush midway. When the Japanese troops went deeper into that place, they were attacked with machine guns and grenades. The Japanese troops, realizing that they had fallen into an ambush, panicked and tried to escape, but ultimately, due to the unfavorable terrain, none of the Japanese troops survived. In this battle, the Chinese side suffered about ten casualties.</p>
<p>The Japanese army camp in Puyuan Town, which belongs to this county and Jiaxing, suffered a disastrous defeat in an attack by the Chinese army on the 21st. They immediately telegraphed the Japanese army authorities in the three counties of Tongxiang, Jiaxing, and Huzhou, requesting reinforcements to be stationed there. More than 300 Japanese soldiers were dispatched from the three places, and fortifications were hastily built in the strategic passes in the outskirts of the town. This was learned by the Chinese side, who launched an attack in three routes again on the evening of the 24th. The Japanese sentries immediately reported to the Japanese camp. The Japanese army, upon hearing the news, immediately dispersed and stubbornly resisted, but after a fierce charge by the Chinese army, the Japanese army was defeated and retreated. The Chinese side, having achieved its mission, destroyed the Japanese fortifications and retreated.</p>
<p>It is learned from Jiaxing and Jiashan that Chinese troops sneaked into the Jiuli Hui area from the defense lines on the 25th late at night, and blew up the bridge near Qixingqiao Station with a large amount of explosives, and pried up the rails for about a li. It is said that when the work was in progress, the Japanese soldiers guarding the railway saw the situation and, due to the disparity in numbers, did not dare to attack. They urgently telegraphed Jiashan Station, but the long-distance telegraph lines had already been cut in advance, so they could not be connected. Therefore, the Chinese side carried out the work leisurely. The next day, the Japanese army forcibly searched the residents in the area and forced them to repair the railway.</p>
<h3 id="e40">Kazuo Aoyama Discusses the Crisis of Japan's Future: The Nara Buddha Image Will Be Sacrificed Due to Lack of Materials <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing Correspondence: It is heard that the New Shu Daily published a translation by Mr. Shen Qiyu, authored by Kazuo Aoyama, entitled "A Domestic Crisis." The following is a transcription:</p>
<p>Since the beginning of this year, the Korean Volunteer Corps, which we planned and participated in, has been participating in the armed regular army warfare and guerrilla warfare of the Chinese army.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the anti-war work has also shifted from general work to centralized work. In Wuhan, the planned anti-war movement of the Japanese army was successful. In the future, we will work harder to carry out the anti-war work.</p>
<p>In Japan, the general anti-war people have also begun to concentrate on political struggles. Therefore, the merger of the fascist "Eastern Society" and "Social Mass Party" is fundamentally impossible. At the same time, the Japanese fascist forces are generally in a state of division. The Kwantung Army faction, the North China Army faction, and the Central China and South China factions are engaged in open and secret struggles. The Hiranuma cabinet, which is forced between these two factions, often wavers and is unstable. The reason why this cabinet is powerless both internally and externally, and yet there is no phenomenon of cabinet collapse, is precisely because the fascist forces are mutually divided and engaged in infighting.</p>
<p>In addition, from the material point of view, it is also extremely lacking due to the war. The degree of lack has reached the point where they want to destroy the famous Nara Buddha statue in order to obtain copper and gold supplements. The value of the Buddha statue is currently under investigation.</p>
<p>In terms of the replenishment of the army, Japan is also in extreme difficulty. The people who remain in Japan are all physically unable to be soldiers. It is said that the ratio of men to women in this year has reached the ratio of one man to twenty women. In Kyushu, although there is an organization called the "Youth League," most of these organizations are "empty" and there are no members.</p>
<p>From the industrial point of view, only military industries exist now. There are 1.3 million unemployed workers in the country who belong to peaceful industries. At present, because the Japanese government forces the export of food such as milk, eggs, and sugar to foreign countries in order to obtain military expenses, food is also extremely insufficient. What is even more serious is that Japan has recently promulgated the "National Requisition Order," which is considered to have forced the "corvée" (pulling laborers), which China has already eliminated, on the entire Japanese population.</p>

<p>Zhenjiang Correspondence: The Chen Regiment of the Chinese army in Zhenjiang, after being thoroughly trained by the New Fourth Army, has become a strong and powerful force. The other day, 150 soldiers of the regiment took advantage of a strong wind and rain to dash towards Xia Shu. Ma Long, under the command of Li Changjiang, the puppet army, was suddenly attacked. The puppet army fled in panic in the dark and 18 were annihilated, Ma Jinlong was seriously injured, and the rest scattered. Xia Shu town was recaptured. The next day, they advanced to Yingfangkou, northeast of Xia Shu, and attacked the Japanese military police headquarters. Ten military police were killed on the spot and more than 30 rifles were seized.</p>

<p>Taixian Correspondence: In recent days, Japanese aircraft have been wreaking havoc in various counties in northern Jiangsu. At 8 a.m. on the 25th, the Taixian Air Defense Office reported that three Japanese aircraft were found in Yong'an Town, and an emergency alarm was immediately issued. It was lifted at 9:40 a.m. According to telephone news from Xinghua, the three aircraft flew from Yong'an into the airspace of Xinghua and dropped seven or eight bombs. The bombed locations included: (1) the Unified Tax Bureau, (2) an egg factory outside the East Gate, (3) a salt warehouse, (4) Zhaoyang Elementary School, (5) the County Middle School, and behind a photo studio. Subsequently, they flew from Qintong to Dongtai and dropped six or seven bombs, passing through the northwest of this county and returning to Yangzhou. Casualties and destroyed houses are currently under investigation.</p>

<p>Wujin Correspondence: Since the regular army infiltrated the occupied counties of Jiangsu Province and reorganized the guerrillas in various places, taking the opportunity to attack, the weather has been hot recently, and they have been using the dark nights to work. In the past half month, the Japanese army has been suffering from running around. For example, on July 14, He Keqian's troops in Jijiashi, Jingjiang, and the guerrillas in Yu Dongzhen, Hong Shouzi near Nantong, fought fiercely with the Japanese army. On the 17th, the puppet pacification team in Pengzhen Town, Kunshan, and Qianmentang Town fought with the guerrillas, and the puppet team was defeated. On the 20th, Yang Wei, the commander of the Chinese army, led the Patriotic Salvation Army to attack the Japanese army in Lu Jiaqiao and Qiqi, Changshou Huangtang, Jiangyin, inflicting heavy casualties on them. On the 22nd, a unit of the New Fourth Army near Xixiashu Town in Wujin attacked the Wuyi Road and engaged in an encounter battle with the Japanese army, inflicting considerable losses on them before retreating.</p>

<p>Suzhou Correspondence: Before the incident, most of the people in this county took refuge nearby, but there were robbery cases in the villages every day. The puppet police, limited by their strength, turned a deaf ear and pretended that nothing had happened. The Japanese army did not ask or hear about it. Recently, since the Chinese troops crossed the river and arrived in this county, the bandits in the villages are no longer as active as they used to be. It is heard that the Chinese army is also engaged in suppressing bandits because the Japanese army has abandoned the strategic points in the suburbs.</p>

<h3 id="e46">Beggar Rehabilitation Education: Great Results Achieved in Three Months of Implementation; More Than 500 People Now Have Productive Skills <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>The authorities of the First Special District of this city, in order to improve the city's appearance, arrested more than 1,400 beggars who were wandering on the streets within the district and opened a beggar asylum in the International Second Reception Center on West Amherst Road to provide them with shelter. At that time, there were several university graduates mixed among them, which aroused deep attention from the community. Many people went to the asylum to visit them. Later, after adopting the suggestions of the education community of this city, the main reasons for the fall of each beggar were thoroughly investigated, and they were given rehabilitation education and productive skills, in order to start a new life. It is learned that more than three months have passed since the implementation of rehabilitation education, and most of the beggars have been sent back to their hometowns by the French Concession authorities one after another. The number of people currently remaining in the asylum is only more than one-third of the previous number, approximately 500 people. All of these 500 people have received general education, none are illiterate or have bad habits, and each person has at least one specialized productive skill. After leaving the asylum in the future and re-entering society, they can make a living. The greatness of the power of education can be seen from this. It is heard that the police authorities of the Public Concession also intend to imitate the methods of the French Concession for beggars in the concession, detaining them and subjecting them to rehabilitation education.</p>

<p>– The Editor</p>
<p>Only a nation that strives for self-sufficiency can become prosperous today. Our nation has a vast domestic market for self-supplied goods, but the standards are not yet met. We have abundant domestic raw materials for self-sufficient manufacturing, but the methods are not yet scientific. Knowledgeable people lament this.</p>
<p>Improving the quality standards of domestic goods and improving manufacturing methods cannot be delayed. In the case of monosodium glutamate, the efforts of patriotic individuals have not been lacking in the past. They have replaced foreign goods that flooded the market with domestic products, reclaiming many rights and interests. However, in terms of quality and quantity, there is still room for improvement in quality, and there is still potential for greater universality in quantity. Therefore, there is an urgent need for entrepreneurs who are in line with the times to gather the greatest perseverance and bring together domestic chemical experts and experienced technicians to manufacture the latest monosodium glutamate to meet the needs of the Chinese people, improve the status of domestic monosodium glutamate, and meet the highest standards. It should be made into a food that everyone needs because of its practical quality that benefits the stomach and intestines and promotes health. It should also make foreign goods disappear from the monosodium glutamate trade market. Therefore, we have compiled a special issue of the Standard Factory to allow the Chinese people to clearly understand the general outline of the Standard Factory and encourage all sectors to pay attention to domestic monosodium glutamate, and to provide good-intentioned supervision and cultivation at any time.</p>
<p>Mr. Yao Junzhi, the general manager of Standard Factory, not only devotes himself to industry, but also is enthusiastic about promoting education. He is especially willing to sympathize with talented and ambitious students who are unable to further their studies. He has proposed to offer an annual scholarship of 1,000 yuan from the factory's "Nine Flavors One" revenue. Although the amount is not very large, Mr. Yao's hard work should be praised by all sectors. Detailed information can be obtained by writing to the factory.</p>

<p>– Yao Junzhi</p>
<p>Clothing, food, housing, and transportation are the four essential elements of life. They cannot be dispensed with, nor can one fail to seek self-sufficiency. This is a problem that modern countries are paying close attention to. Before China had trade with Europe and the United States, it was diligent in farming and weaving and was able to be self-sufficient. However, with the import of foreign goods, their novelty in quality and the sophistication of their manufacturing were widely promoted, which made Chinese products appear inferior. The Chinese people's psychology of admiring foreign goods became a habit. Even in the slightest matters of diet and daily life, they would worship foreign goods and rely solely on foreign goods. The outflow of rights and interests cannot be counted. Since the War of Resistance, patriotic individuals in the domestic goods industry have focused on saving the country through production. They have seized the opportunity to rise up, burying their heads in hard work. Heavy and light industries in various places have made considerable progress. However, the August 13th Incident broke out in Shanghai, and factories in the suburbs were almost completely destroyed. Only a few survived in the concession areas. At this time, developing domestic goods, increasing production, and relieving unemployment are the most important responsibilities for us to strengthen the economic power of the rear. However, difficulties arise one after another, and success is not easy. Only Junzhi believes that in order to start a business, in addition to capital and talent, one must have "spirit." There is a saying that spirit is the mother of business. Those who can overcome all setbacks and persevere tirelessly must have great perseverance. In other words, those who possess the spirit of entrepreneurship must always use their clear and decisive thinking, broad and sharp vision, and self-motivated spirit to serve society and work hard for the cause. Any environment cannot shake their will. Moreover, we should consider things from a broad and long-term perspective, and not focus on immediate interests. We should aim to improve products, raise domestic standards, recover rights and interests, and enrich people's livelihood, so that we can promote the prestige of domestic products and make up for any losses. Junzhi has been engaged in the new pharmaceutical industry for sixteen years. In recent years, in view of the urgent need for domestic monosodium glutamate and the fact that inferior products that are mixed with water and disregard commercial ethics are flooding the market, making it difficult for customers to choose and their trust is declining, he felt that there was a need to remedy this. Therefore, he gathered chemical experts and other professionals to research how to improve it and make the raw materials, quality, and packaging meet the standards they should have. It will open up a bright new path for domestic monosodium glutamate. Therefore, after three months of day and night of active preparation, the first factory was completed. Products such as "Nine Flavors One" and "Fresh King" have also been launched on the market one after another. Junzhi is ashamed of his lack of knowledge. He can be said to be completely ignorant of the traditional monosodium glutamate. He relies on the guidance of advanced people from all walks of life and the efforts of all colleagues to achieve success. In the future, he will make greater efforts to contribute to the preparation of domestic monosodium glutamate and amino acid derivatives, and will continue to work tirelessly to make the domestic status shine internationally. He hopes that advanced people from all walks of life at home and abroad will give guidance from time to time to help him overcome his shortcomings.</p>
<h3 id="e62">The Freshness and Plant Protein <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>– Dr. Zhao Jintao, Pharmacology</p>
<p>The reason why food has a fresh taste is because it contains fresh quality. The amount of fresh quality determines whether the taste is good or bad. This fresh quality is d-Glutamic Acid. Glutamic acid comes from protein. After this substance is hydrolyzed, it produces a variety of amino acids. Glutamic acid is one of the amino acids. Proteins are divided into animal and plant proteins. Fish and meat are animal proteins, while gluten and tofu are famous plant proteins. Animal proteins often do not contain as much glutamic acid as plant proteins, but the latter must be chemically decomposed to obtain a large amount of glutamic acid. Therefore, monosodium glutamate is made from plant protein and is regarded as a luxury item in the past. Now, it is as important as oil and soy sauce and is an indispensable necessity for daily cooking. The reason why monosodium glutamate is what it is today can be attributed to two things:</p>
<p>One is the skillful use of applied chemistry, and the other is the emphasis on the art of living. Glutamic acid was discovered in 1868 by the German Rittbausen, who used sulfuric acid to decompose plant protein to obtain it. At that time, it was only a scientific discovery, but he did not know how to use it to make it practical. Who knew that fifty years later, Eastern people would use it as a daily necessity to directly increase personal appetite and enjoyment, and indirectly increase the health and prosperity of the nation? This is indeed the result of skillfully using chemistry, but it is also the result of the Eastern people's emphasis on the art of living. From this, it can be seen that although Western science is prosperous, the art of living is far inferior to that of the Eastern people. This is also a manifestation of the strengths of Eastern and Western cultures.</p>

<p>In December of the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938), Mr. Yao Junzhi, the initiator and current general manager of the company, made full efforts to plan. By March of the 28th year of the Republic of China (1939), the first factory was completed. It officially opened on April 1st. On January 10th of the same year, accountant Shen Xuejun was entrusted to legally submit a report to the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the National Government for record. On February 6th and February 24th, trademarks such as Wei Dawang, Jiu Wei Yi, Xian Fu Wang, and Standard Brand were submitted to the Trademark Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs for registration. Subsequently, the Ministry of Economic Affairs issued the approval "All submitted documents are approved for record" and the Trademark Bureau issued approval for registration and exclusive use and issued Trademark Examination Certificates No. "27917", "28001", and "28002". Later, in order to encourage the export of national goods, the government prepared procedures again and entrusted accountant Shen to apply to the Ministry of Economic Affairs on May 20th of this year to exempt taxes and issue national goods certificates in accordance with the current regulations on mechanized Western-style goods tax and joined the Shanghai National Goods Seasoning Products Manufacturing Industry Association's Mechanized National Goods Factory Federation as a member. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent personnel to investigate and confirmed that it was a national goods new type of monosodium glutamate and approved the issuance of certificate No. 5163. The key points are hereby published for public viewing.</p>

<h3 id="e67">The Three Standards of Standard <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>– Pan Yangyao</p>
<p>(1) Innovative Standard for Manufacturing Technology</p>
<p>There are no fewer than 20 monosodium glutamate factories in Shanghai, large and small, and the equipment of the Standard Factory is particularly new. Based on what I have seen, I will try to give two examples of the most advanced innovative standards for manufacturing technology designed and created by the factory itself:</p>
<p>A. Hydrolysis Time Shortened by More Than Half: In the production process of monosodium glutamate, the ordinary hydrolysis time under normal pressure is 36 hours, and some even take 60 hours due to simple equipment. However, the latest invention of the Standard Factory is that the hydrolysis time under normal pressure is only 20 hours, and the pressurized time is only 10 hours. After experts visited and confirmed that it has indeed created the latest standard in monosodium glutamate manufacturing technology.</p>
<p>B. Success in Odor-Free Evaporation Equipment: Ordinary evaporation equipment has the disadvantage of odor overflowing, causing the surrounding residents to feel disgusted. The odor-free device of the Standard Factory uses the principle of vacuum to condense all the odor and recover part of the acetic acid. Therefore, even if people stand in front of the stove, they do not smell the odor. This new invention has been praised by the Shanghai Public Concession Health Bureau and the Industrial Section as the latest equipment standard that a monosodium glutamate factory should have.</p>
<p>(2) Innovative Standard for Work Efficiency</p>
<p>The efficiency of ordinary factories is very low due to the abandonment of work and the lax management. However, from Mr. Yao Junzhi, the general manager of the Standard Factory, to the workers, they all abide by the four words of the Standard Factory's motto: Honesty, Diligence, Perseverance, and Endurance. Moreover, due to the latest scientific management, the work efficiency achieved is very amazing. Since the opening of the business, the ratio of the quantity of powder produced in three months to the number of workers has exceeded the effect of more than three times that of ordinary factories. Looking at the spirit of the whole factory, it is indeed suitable for its innovative standard of efficiency.</p>
<p>(3) Innovative Standard for Product Quality</p>
<p>Because of the above two innovative standards, the quantity of products from the Standard Factory is amazing. As for the enthusiastic welcome and best-selling situation at home and abroad, it is because the quality of its products, "Nine Flavors One" and "Fresh King", is superior. Whether it is an expert or a layman, anyone who studies its ingredients knows that its quality is indeed purer than other domestic seasonings. Therefore, the phrase "Complete Protein, Fresh Taste, Nourishing Stomach" commonly used by the Standard Factory has become a new standard for the quality of monosodium glutamate. The above three points are just a brief description of what I have seen. Fortunately, the factory welcomes academic groups to visit and discuss matters. All sectors may wish to write to contact the factory for a decision and a more detailed personal reference.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Chinese People Don't Believe It, Foreigners Find It Strange <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>After Jiu Wei Yi and Xian Da Wang were launched on the market, because of their fine quality and elegant packaging, the Chinese people did not believe that there could be such excellent products among domestic goods. Foreigners also found it strange that Chinese goods could be so advanced.</p>
<p>But the fact is indeed the fact. With Chinese capital, Chinese management, Chinese technology, and the use of domestic raw materials as much as possible, the Standard Factory, which worked hard from top to bottom, has finally succeeded in producing the Standard Monosodium Glutamate Jiu Wei Yi and Da Wang. It is one of the jobs of goods labeling.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Standardization Issues of National Seasoning Powder <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>– Zhou Dingyi, Doctor of Chemistry</p>
<p>The history of seasoning powder in our country is only more than ten years. There are only more than ten factories that manufacture it. In recent years, the number of new factories established has doubled. This is indeed a blessing for the industry. However, it contains a major problem, that is, how to standardize seasoning products to increase the reputation of national goods overseas. For more than a year, I have presided over the chemistry department of the Central and Shanghai Municipal Health Laboratories. I have also drafted many regulations on food and drink, and I have first published temporary test methods for sodium glutamate. I was about to start organizing the monosodium glutamate on the market because the outbreak of the war interrupted my work. It is a pity that I have not been able to complete it. Now, I have witnessed the numerous varieties and complex categories of seasonings on the market, and I feel that it is absolutely necessary to take care of them. The most common prohibited examples in the food and drink laws of various countries in the world are adulterants, especially in the laws of various states in the United States. Therefore, any food or drink that contains adulterants is subject to prohibition. For example, sodium salts of organic matter contained in sodium glutamate should be listed as adulterants. In short, the standard of seasoning powder, we must first have a definition of seasoning powder, that is, "Seasoning powder is a product rich in d-sodium glutamate, which may contain a small amount of sodium chloride (food identification)." This is a more reasonable definition. According to this, the following types of standard components should be included:</p>
<p>Grade A Seasoning Powder Standard</p>
<p>Sodium glutamate content shall not be less than 85%.</p>
<p>Salt content shall not be more than 15%.</p>
<p>In fact, in view of the fact that general customers prefer to use more irritating monosodium glutamate, there should be Grade B standards as well:</p>
<p>Grade B Seasoning Powder Standard</p>
<p>Sodium glutamate content shall not be less than 70%.</p>
<p>Salt content shall not be more than 20%.</p>
<p>If other mixtures are mixed according to the above-mentioned Grade A and B components (because the crystal water content accounts for one molecular weight of sodium glutamate), it is impossible. However, the actual sodium glutamate content of monosodium glutamate on the market is as low as 16%, and in addition to salt, it is almost 60%. This kind of suicidal policy is enough to destroy its existing market. Therefore, manufacturers bear great responsibility for the degradation of quality and urgently need to make plans. The fact of "standardizing seasoning powder" is dedicated to the market, and the future of seasoning powder will be fortunate, and the future of national goods will be fortunate. The motivation for the establishment of Standard Monosodium Glutamate Factory lies in this. The goal of all designs is to produce a monosodium glutamate that meets the above-mentioned Grade A standard under the conditions of national technology, national financial resources, national machinery, and national raw materials to supply the society. In this market filled with mixed monosodium glutamate, we are promoting the natural elimination principle of the superior winning over the inferior, winning the love and love of customers, and the permanent trust of those who love national goods.</p>

<p>When talking about freshness, people in the food industry all recommend beef, mutton, pork, duck, fish, shrimp, and the other nine kinds as the freshest. Who knows that a kind of Jiu Wei Yi can be better than these nine kinds of freshness, and it is absolutely pure, refreshing, and hygienic. It can protect the stomach. If you add a little Jiu Wei Yi when cooking these fresh dishes, the freshness will be added to the freshness. If you add a little Jiu Wei Yi when cooking vegetarian dishes, the cleanness will be added to the freshness. The freshness of the taste is nothing more than this.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association held its first general membership meeting yesterday at 4:30 PM at the Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association. Representatives from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the relief committees of the Chinese Taxpayers' Associations of the two concessions, the Federation of Citizens of the First Special District, various trade guilds, various Shanghai fellow-provincial associations, various charitable organizations, and fundraising committees from the association's citizen, fellow-provincial, education, amateur performer, and dance hall groups, totaling over a thousand people, attended. Among the Chinese and Western directors and committee members of the association present were Michael, Keswick, Xu Jikang, Mao Lizhi, Jiang Yiping, Xi Yushu, and committee member Huang Yuzhai. The meeting was chaired by Director Yu Qiaqing, with secretaries Ren Jinpin, Yan E’sheng, Liu Shifang, Li Kangcheng, and Hui Keyuan. Master of ceremonies Shao Xubai. The Director delivered the opening speech, and Secretary-General Yuan Ludeng reported on the association's affairs in various districts and groups. Treasurer Xi Yushu reported on the collection and expenditure of donations. When he reported on the Central Relief Committee's allocation of 105,000 yuan, the representatives present were deeply moved by the Central Committee's kindness. It was resolved that Jiang Yiping, on behalf of the board of directors, would submit various proposals to the general meeting for discussion. Subsequently, a motion was made to express gratitude to the Director and the directors on behalf of the general meeting.</p>
<p>Speech by the Director: Director Yu Qiaqing said in his opening speech, "Today, the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association is holding a general meeting. I am deeply grateful and honored by the presence of representatives from various groups and leaders from all walks of life. On behalf of the association and all the refugees in Shanghai, I extend my deepest gratitude. The association has been established for nine months. Although these nine months have been in an extremely difficult environment, the association's affairs have always been able to progress gradually. This cannot be attributed to the enthusiasm of international dignitaries, leaders from all walks of life, and all people in Shanghai for the general mobilization of refugees. As the ancient saying goes, 'When it comes to doing good, who is not as good as me?' In fact, judging from the experience of running the association, it can be said that 'When it comes to doing good, everyone is better than me.' I imagine that so many refugees need to be supported for such a long time. If everyone did not have a good heart and the act of doing good, relying on a few people would definitely not be sustainable. The character 'association' is composed of a heart character and three force characters. I think using this character to represent the spirit of the relief association is the truest and most accurate. Why? These three force characters are manpower, financial resources, and material resources. First is manpower. Since the establishment of the association, how many people have exerted their strength, running around and taking care of things, braving the cold and heat, not only without pay but also paying for their own transportation. This kind of effort is truly admirable. People say that the senior staff of the association are all serving voluntarily, which is admirable. In fact, comparing the voluntary service of the association's staff with the efforts of people from all walks of life, we are much more ashamed. Second is financial resources. Needless to say, from providing sustenance to education, post-disaster care, medicine, and hygiene, nothing can be done without money. Since the establishment of the association, the donations received, from all walks of life to the hardworking compatriots, they have used various methods, such as adding a surcharge to their business, deducting from their salaries, providing disaster relief from the savings, using savings from ceremonial occasions or banquets, broadcasting appeals, or performing dramas to raise funds. The most notable achievements are the Citizen Group's organization of refugee adoption and the Education Group's promotion of the Happy to Do Good badge campaign, and the fundraising for the refugee production education fund. This is enough to show the generous support of people from all walks of life, fearing that they will be left behind, so that the association can not only maintain the refugees' sustenance but also further plan for their post-disaster care, imparting skills. How precious and admirable this is. Third is material resources. Donating clothes in the winter, donating medicine in the summer, buying rice and trading coal, which is especially cheap, saving the association one point of economy means increasing one point of welfare for the refugees. This is also very touching. But these three kinds of force still have to rely on one heart to connect them. What is this heart? It is a good heart, that is, a loving heart. The three kinds of forces are valuable and sustainable only when they are driven by this good and loving heart. Which of you gentlemen who are attending today is not here driven by a good and loving heart? Everyone has this same warm, pure, and sincere heart, so naturally, we can understand each other and there are many things that we can understand without saying. As the Western saying goes, 'From war comes human affection.' This saying is really good. Shanghai has also held many relief efforts for droughts and floods in the past, but there has never been such a large scale, such a long time, such good results, and such an organization that can cooperate with both Chinese and foreigners. It is precisely because this relief is generated in the midst of war. War has given everyone a deep impression, so it also has a deep sense of sympathy. This sense of sympathy will also develop into new light and become a new torch. Please ask Secretary-General Yuan Ludeng and Treasurer Xi Yushu to report on everything that has happened. I am convinced that everyone will accept this report and will continue to help the association and guide the association so that it can complete its final mission."</p>
<p>Discussion of Proposals</p>
<p>(1) Proposal to pass the revenue and expenditure report, resolved and passed. (2) Proposal submitted by the Board of Directors for ratification: A. Director Brant has returned to his country and applied to resign. On May 24 of this year, the association, in accordance with Article 4, Section 2 of the association's constitution, "When there is a vacancy in the board of directors, it may be nominated by the board of directors," nominated Mao Lishi as a director. This should be ratified by the general meeting. B. The association's constitution originally stipulated that there should be four committees: finance, administration, post-disaster care, and supervision. Later, due to the large number of refugees and the huge amount of money needed, the fundraising plan of the Finance Committee was separately handled by the Fundraising Committee. In addition, due to the educational campaign raising more than 100,000 yuan, the education item of the Administrative Committee was separately handled by the Education Committee. The work training of the Post-Disaster Care Committee was also assigned to the Education Committee. At the same time, the duties of the Post-Disaster Care Committee were increased by adding a production education item. Furthermore, because medicine is related to people's lives, it should be given more importance than any other matter, so the medicine item of the Administrative Committee was changed to the Medical Affairs (i.e., Hygiene) Committee, which was also made independent. This should also be requested to be ratified by the general meeting. Both of the above two proposals were resolved and ratified. (3) The Fundraising Committee suggested how to continue fundraising to maintain the refugees' sustenance. The Fundraising Director, Fang Jiaobo, explained the proposal, saying, "The association has been established for more than half a year. Thanks to the mutual assistance of all sectors and the responsibility for disaster relief, everyone has generously donated and enthusiastically transported, so that the refugees' sustenance has not been interrupted. I am very grateful. However, the subscription period for each group is fixed for one year or half a year. The fundraising times vary, and the subscriptions have now expired. The association has asked them to continue fundraising, and all of them have agreed. Therefore, the sustenance is not a problem for the time being. However, the future is still long, and the difficulty can be helped. The post-disaster care of refugees must wait for time. If limited donations are used for long-term assistance, it can be inferred that it will be difficult to achieve success. If long-term strategies are not properly planned and fundraising is not continued, then the future is long and there is a hidden worry. How should we determine the method of continued fundraising? I dare to submit it to the general meeting and respectfully ask everyone to express their great opinions and jointly discuss the post-disaster care. This is what I should do, and please make a public decision." Zhang Deqin, Zhou Bangjun, and Ma Shaoquan seconded the proposal and made supplementary comments. The general meeting unanimously resolved to continue fundraising in accordance with the original subscription methods. (4) Huang Yuqi, the representative of the silver industry, temporarily proposed that the director, directors, secretary-general, and leaders of various departments and groups of the association provide voluntary service to the refugees. The general meeting should express its gratitude. Cao Zhigong, Zhu Qizhen, and others seconded the proposal, and it was unanimously passed. (5) Feng Meixue temporarily proposed that the association should supervise and improve the management of the shelters. Director Jiang Yiping explained, and Jiang Xinzhao, Yu Jingyu, and others made supplementary comments. It was resolved that the proposal should be handed over to the Board of Directors to be forwarded to the Supervisory Office for handling. The other suggestions from the Haimen Fellow-Provincial Association on sheltering beggars on the streets and from Ying Yongyu were all resolved to be handed over to the Board of Directors.</p>
<h3 id="e76">New Regulations Reissued for Banning Transportation of Goods Aiding Japan; Bamboo, Wood, Paper, Eggs, etc., Allowed to Be Exempted from Transportation Ban to Shanghai; Tea and Tung Oil Should Continue to Be Handled with Foreign Exchange Settlement <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Economic Affairs promulgated the regulations on banning the transportation of goods aiding Japan, regulations on the transportation to Shanghai have been stipulated and are now ordered to be followed by all provinces and cities, and the Ministry of Finance has ordered the customs in various places to implement them. Here is the announcement from the Zhejiang Customs Superintendent and Commissioner of Customs: "It has been found that the list of goods designated to be prohibited from being transported to aid Japan, the list of areas where goods are prohibited from being transported to aid Japan, and the regulations on emergency relief for transporting prohibited goods to Shanghai have been promulgated successively by this customs in Announcements No. 99, No. 100, and No. 106, respectively. Now, the Ministry of Finance has ordered that various regulations be stipulated as follows:</p>
<p>Bamboo and Wood Transportation Ban</p>
<p>(1) All bamboo and wood (except those that can be used for construction), paper (except newsprint), charcoal, eggs, and tea that have been reviewed by the Trade Commission and are not suitable for export shall be exempt from the transportation ban to Shanghai. (2) The previously stipulated regulations on emergency relief for transporting prohibited goods to Shanghai shall be abolished. All domestic goods that are still under the transportation ban, except for white pig bristles, which can be transported by the Trade Commission, can be transported to the Shanghai Public Concession and the French Concession by manufacturers in our country or friendly countries in accordance with the following two methods, A and B:</p>
<p>Transportation to Shanghai Method</p>
<p>A. Before shipment, the chamber of commerce or trade association of the place of shipment and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce or the consuls of friendly countries in Shanghai shall issue certificates proving the purpose of the goods being transported to Shanghai and the name and address of the manufacturer in our country or the friendly country, and shall earnestly guarantee that the goods will not be used to aid Japan after being transported to Shanghai. B. The above two certificates shall be submitted to the county government of the place of origin for verification, and then submitted to the customs of the place of origin when applying for the shipment of goods. The customs shall retain the certificates and submit them to the Ministry of Finance for forwarding to the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</p>
<p>Exemption from Transportation Ban Certificate</p>
<p>(3) The Resources Committee, the Agricultural and Commercial Bank, the Trade Commission, or their entrusted merchants are temporarily allowed to purchase and transport prohibited goods aiding Japan to any place without being subject to the above restrictions. The customs shall release the goods based on the exemption from transportation ban certificate issued by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and stamped by the Ministry of Finance. After verifying the additional seal, the customs of the place of origin shall retain the transportation certificate and forward it to the Ministry of Finance. However, if the goods still need to pass through the customs of other centrally controlled areas before being transported to foreign countries or guerrilla areas, the above-mentioned transportation certificate shall be returned to the carrier and recovered by the customs that last passed through and submitted to the Ministry of Finance for cancellation. (4) Among the prohibited goods aiding Japan, tea, tung oil, and other items that should be settled in foreign exchange should still be settled in foreign exchange as usual and pay taxes as usual before the customs release the goods.</p>
<p>Prohibited Areas</p>
<p>(5) The prohibited areas shall be based on the attached list of prohibited areas for goods aiding Japan. All previously issued lists of prohibited areas shall be revoked. The above methods should be followed. Now, two points are further clarified as follows: A. As stated in Article 2 of the regulations set by the Ministry, the Shanghai Public Concession and the French Concession include all wharves and warehouses of foreign firms in Pudong. B. The regulations set by the Ministry also apply to goods sent by mail. The attached list of prohibited areas for goods aiding Japan is copied and announced for general knowledge.

<h3 id="e77">Rice Shops in the French Concession Comply with Price Limits by Posting Prices; Rice Stored in Warehouses Is All Bai Geng; Hoarders Are Reluctant to Sell <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rice Shop Trade Association issued an emergency notice stating: "Recently, rice prices have soared, and market transactions are chaotic. The lowest-grade Bai Geng cannot be purchased anywhere at the price limit of 20 yuan per picul. High-quality rice samples have disappeared from the market, resulting in off-market transactions exceeding the price limits. Such behavior, whether selling, buying, or acting as an intermediary, is illegal. Therefore, we earnestly advise our fellow rice shop owners to strictly comply with the price limits set by the concession authorities. The price of high-quality Bai Geng should not exceed 20 yuan in national currency per picul, and the price of Ke Xian should not exceed 16 yuan per picul. If high-quality rice is needed on the market, you should temporarily endure it during this chaotic market situation and never purchase it at prices exceeding the limit. If there are off-market transactions exceeding the limit, settle the accounts according to the price limit and report the situation to the association so that it can be reported to the authorities for thorough investigation. I hope that all my fellow rice shop owners will not indulge in favoritism and self-interest. I hope that you will strictly abide by this. Furthermore, the association has recently received a notice from the French Municipal Council stating that rice shops in the French Concession must write the rice prices clearly according to the price limits and display them in front of the door every day starting from today. I hope you will comply with this."</p>
<p>Rice Stored in Warehouses Is All Bai Geng</p>
<p>In recent days, the concession authorities have strictly enforced price limits. Rice merchants, hoarders, and speculators have avoided the real situation and used the market as a place for off-market transactions. Outside the market, they have engaged in private transactions. Since Monday, they have not displayed samples of the highest-grade Bai Geng and ordinary Bai Geng, resulting in the disappearance of Bai Geng in the market. However, in reality, more than 200,000 bags of goods are stored in various warehouses, most of which are Bai Geng. The authorities, aware of this, are investigating the names of the owners, persuading them to sell, and not hoarding or manipulating the market, which affects people's food.</p>
<p>Hoarders of Stored Rice Have Been Identified</p>
<p>The rice stored in Shanghai is stored in various bank warehouses, private warehouses, and cargo warehouses. In order to prevent hoarding, speculation, and manipulation, the concession authorities have sent personnel to thoroughly investigate the names of the owners of the goods in various warehouses in order to verify and handle the situation. It has been learned that the rice stored in a certain bank warehouse is hoarded by non-industry people, attempting to speculate and make profits. The authorities have ordered the owner to sell all of the rice at or below the price limit. At the same time, they hope that citizens will report cases of rice shops exceeding the price limit to the police at any time. If the investigation proves to be true, they will be investigated and dealt with, and all transactions exceeding the price limit will be deemed invalid.</p>
<p>People's Food Supply Is Absolutely Not Worried About Shortage</p>
<p>The food supply for the people of Shanghai is absolutely not worried about shortage. There are six reasons for this: (1) The total amount of goods stored in various warehouses in the city is hundreds of thousands of bags, which is more than enough to supply the city. (2) The ban on rice exports from Wuhu will be lifted on August 1 after being cleared. (3) Rice industry groups and concession authorities are actively clearing the sources of supply from various places. (4) On average, more than 3,000 bags of goods arrive every day. (5) Dongxin Geng will be available on the market in ten days. (6) Other new rice will also be available on the market.</p>
<p>Authorities' Measures for Handling Stored Rice</p>
<p>The Public Concession Bureau and the French Municipal Council, in order to prevent hoarders from speculating and manipulating the market and affecting the food supply for the entire city, have jointly notified various banks, money shops, warehouses, and private temporary warehouses to report the quantity of stored rice and the names of the owners in detail within a time limit. According to a report from the Daguan News Agency, the authorities' action is to completely and thoroughly investigate whether this stored rice is in the hands of rice merchants or non-industry people, and why they are hoarding it and not selling it. The first step is to persuade the hoarders to sell it immediately in order to maintain the market. If the persuasion method fails to achieve results, then it is known that they are intentionally hoarding and manipulating the market. The second step will be to adopt appropriate measures and implement them in a mandatory manner to ensure that market transactions and supply and demand correspond to each other, and that market prices are balanced.</p>
<p>Common People Hope for Implementation of Government Rice Sales</p>
<p>The reason for the abnormal price increase in the Shanghai rice market is that if there is no manipulation and hoarding of prices by speculators and hoarders, the price will not continue to rise. Therefore, the general public has doubled their burden on the daily necessities of life, and the poor citizens feel it deeply. They are pleased with the wise concession authorities' stance on maintaining the food supply for the people. They hope that the authorities will order the hoarders to quickly plan for government rice sales to benefit the common people and reduce their burden.</p>
<p>Market Transactions Stalled Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>The Fuzhou Road Rice Industry Market of the Bean and Rice Industry Association opened at 9:00 yesterday morning. Because the hoarders still took a wait-and-see attitude, no samples of rice from the upper and middle grades were brought into the market. Except for a few Xian rice that was slightly available, there were no other rice for sale. Therefore, although the market formally opened, it was actually in a state of stagnation. The reason for this is that speculators are still manipulating the market. I hope the authorities will pay attention to it in order to maintain normal market transactions.</p>
<p>Selling Privately at Prices Exceeding the Limit, Refusing to Issue Invoices</p>
<p>The authorities of the two concessions have strictly enforced price limits in order to maintain the food supply for the people. For example, Jiu Da Rice Shop was penalized by having its business license revoked for exceeding the price limit. Many other rice shops that exceeded the limit have also received the same penalty. Therefore, people's minds have turned stable. Currently, some rice shops, in order to avoid punishment, refuse to issue invoices for rice that exceeds the price limit. I hope that citizens will report them to the police at any time to assist the authorities in maintaining rice prices.</p>

<p>The English-language "Great America Evening News" reported that half of the 260 Chinese drivers and conductors of the Japanese public bus company in Hongkou suddenly refused to work for the company yesterday (the 27th). Although the company immediately tried its best to recruit Japanese drivers and conductors, the public bus traffic in Hongkou could only maintain three-fifths of its normal level. According to the Japanese public bus company, Chinese guerrillas appeared in Hongkou via the Public Concession and the French Concession and threatened its Chinese employees. It also said that the company's labor conditions were not bad, providing free accommodation, with drivers receiving a monthly salary of 50 yuan and female conductors receiving 25 yuan.</p>

<p>Xie Jinyuan, Regiment Commander of the Lone Army, sent a letter to the Public Concession Municipal Council yesterday stating, "It has been twenty-one months since we have been detained here. I truly do not know why this third party's request and the high authorities' order to withdraw were both out of consideration for the safety of the concession. Now, China and Japan are at war without a declaration of war. No one can predict when the war will end. Therefore, I dare to ask your Bureau to deeply consider the issue of restoring our freedom. This is not only the fortune of public justice and international treaties, but also the fortune of human civilization. To the Public Concession Municipal Council."</p>

<h3 id="e80">Confiscated Garbage Trucks Returned to the Municipal Council; No Conditions Attached When Returning the Vehicles; Now Requesting Monthly Payment of 15,000 Yuan <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>The "China Mail" reports that the hundred or so foreign and Chinese workers of the Public Works Department of the Municipal Council who were detained by the "Great Way" authorities on Sunday afternoon were released on Wednesday noon. At the same time, the thirty-one trucks of the Public Works Department that were confiscated were also returned to the Municipal Council authorities shortly after 4:00 PM yesterday (the 27th). As far as can be confirmed, no conditions were attached to the return of the vehicles. A Japanese naval spokesman stated at a press conference yesterday, "Mayor" Chuan Xiaoan misunderstood the agreement between the Japanese Marines and the Municipal Council regarding dumping garbage in the designated area near Baziqiao. Both parties faithfully abide by the terms of the agreement, which "Mayor" Chuan apparently did not know. The spokesman replied to a question that, in his opinion, the issue of the Municipal Council paying a monthly fee did not arise. Because the Municipal Council did not protest to the Japanese Marines, the release of people and vehicles was delayed for a long time. When all three parties knew the truth of the situation, the matter was resolved and is now over. Before yesterday evening, the reporter visited Mr. Chuan to verify.</p>
<p>Trucks Returned</p>
<p>The reporter asked if the "Great Way" municipal government would require the Municipal Council to pay a fee. Mr. Fu confirmed that he had asked the Municipal Council to pay 15,000 yuan per month, instead of the 10,000 yuan paid to the Shanghai municipal government before the war. When asked why the fee was higher than before, he said that there were more people currently living in the Public Concession, so there was more garbage. According to Public Works Department personnel, the incident of being detained by the "Great Way" police while attempting to dump garbage in the area designated by the Japanese Marines was sudden. It has been more than four weeks since the Municipal Council and the "Great Way" authorities discussed the garbage dumping matter. It was learned yesterday that the talks will continue.</p>

<p>Gold Prices Fall, Securities Rise, Discount Drops</p>
<p>Since the United States announced the abolition of the U.S.-Japan Trade Treaty, the Shanghai financial market has improved, the black market for foreign exchange has loosened, the black market for securities has risen, and the black market for gold prices has fallen. According to a report from the New Voice News Agency yesterday after inquiring about the financial market: (1) In the black market for foreign exchange, although the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation quoted 4 pence for British exchange and 7.75 yuan for U.S. exchange, the actual market price was 4.375 pence for British exchange and 8.375 yuan for U.S. exchange, which was slightly looser compared to the previous day. (2) In the black market for gold, prices fell after opening yesterday morning. The closing price in the morning was 3,800 yuan, and the closing price in the afternoon was 3,695 yuan. The public price quoted by major silver shops has dropped from 390 yuan to 375 yuan. (3) The black market for securities rose yesterday. The closing price in the morning was 53.6 yuan for Unified Government Bonds Type A, up 1.6 yuan; 44.3 yuan for Type B, up 9 cents; 42.6 yuan for Type C, up 8 cents; 41.9 yuan for Type D, up 9 cents; and 42.25 yuan for Type E, up 9 cents.

<p>French Concession Consolidates Defenses; Parking Prohibited in Chang Geng Lane</p>
<p>In order to maintain the safety and security of residents in the concession, the French Concession authorities, in addition to stepping up the number of patrols in the concession and searching entrants, are building two concrete fortifications at the west end of the Great World on Avenue Edward VII. Construction of the fortifications began yesterday and is expected to be completed today. At the same time, in the Public Concession, signs have been erected on Avenue Edward VII from the entrance of Chang Geng Lane east of Jiangxi Road to the intersection of Jiangxi Road, with a special notice stating, "Parking is prohibited here," in order to prevent the occurrence of similar incidents as the Chang Geng Lane attack a few days ago. The "China Mail" reported that most of the bungalows on Zhoujiazui Island belong to nationals of third countries. When the war broke out in Shanghai a few years ago, some of these bungalows were destroyed or completely destroyed, and they were also looted. The Japanese military authorities controlling the island have recently discussed the issue with the third-country nationals who own the bungalows through the Japanese consulate and are willing to compensate them. The exact amount of compensation is unknown. The Zhoujiazui Island Residents Association has been working for many months to enable its members to obtain compensation. The Japanese military authorities have their own appraisers to assess the value of these bungalows in order to determine the amount of compensation. Although the compensation is much lower than the actual value of the houses, it is heard that some foreigners have accepted this solution, but other bungalow owners have refused the compensation offered by the Japanese authorities on the grounds that their houses are worth more than the compensation. It is also heard that the Japanese authorities have so far refused to consider compensation for the items in the bungalows, such as refrigerators and radios, many of which were stolen during the war. The value of these items is often higher than the value of the bungalows. It is understood that this is the first time the Japanese authorities have decided to compensate for the damage caused by the war in the suburbs of Shanghai.</p>

<p>Around 4:30 PM yesterday afternoon, a young man in a Western suit was seen at the Thames Building on Avenue Edward VII, ascending in the elevator. He held a paper package under his arm and carried a suitcase in his hand. The stationed detective found him suspicious and subjected him to a search. Upon opening the paper package, it was found to contain a pistol. Following this lead, the detectives opened the suitcase and discovered six more pistols and over two hundred bullets inside. The youth was immediately detained and questioned about his origin. He claimed to be from the Da Feng Heng Customs Brokerage in Room 319 of the building. The detectives immediately searched Room 319 and took all the occupants into custody for investigation. According to a reporter's subsequent investigation, the company had leased the premises six months ago, and its daily business was unclear, but card playing could be heard day and night without interruption.</p>

<p>Shipping fees paid in legal tender, to be settled within three days of customs clearance.</p>
<p>Starting June 22nd, the British companies Butterfield &amp; Swire and Jardine Matheson revised their freight rates, recalculating the price list in Hong Kong dollars. Customs brokerages pay freight charges in national currency, with the two companies settling the exchange rate of national currency to Hong Kong dollars every two weeks. Other companies have followed suit (freight charges are still calculated in national currency). Recently, there has been a sudden and drastic shrinking and soaring of Hong Kong dollar exchange rates. To mitigate losses, Butterfield &amp; Swire and Jardine Matheson have now decided to revise the method of settling freight charges in national currency based on Hong Kong dollar exchange rates, effective from the 30th of this month. The announcement from the two companies is recorded below: "Important Notice: Effective July 30th, the payment of freight charges will be implemented according to the following methods: (1) Cargo and passengers may pay freight charges in Hong Kong dollars according to the price list. (2) Cargo and passengers may also pay freight charges in Chinese national currency based on the Hong Kong dollar amount listed in the price list, calculated using the exchange rate announced by our company on the customs clearance date of each shipment. This freight charge must be paid within three days after the customs clearance date of each shipment; otherwise, the exchange rate on the payment date will be used for calculation. (3) Freight deposits may be paid by cargo and passengers in Hong Kong dollars or Chinese national currency, according to the following methods: A. If the deposit is paid in Hong Kong dollars, the freight charge will be calculated according to the price list. After the amount is verified, any surplus or deficiency will be refunded or collected in Hong Kong dollars. B. If the deposit is paid in national currency, the amount will still be calculated in Hong Kong dollars. The deposit collected will be converted into Hong Kong dollars using the exchange rate announced by our company on the shipping date of the goods, and stored. After the amount is verified, any surplus or deficiency will be refunded or collected in Chinese national currency based on the original exchange rate."</p>

<h3 id="e87">Major Clash Among Puppet Troops in Xinchang <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Over a Hundred Puppet Soldiers Dead, Over Thirty Japanese Soldiers Killed or Wounded</p>
<p>On the night before last (the 27th), around 8:00 PM, a major clash occurred among the troops of Zhang Miaogen, a puppet "army" stationed in Xinchang Town, District 7 of Nanhui, Pudong, due to conflicting interests. The leader of the faction clashing with Zhang's men is still unknown. However, the fierce battle continued until dawn before ceasing, resulting in heavy casualties, with each side suffering sixty to seventy dead or wounded, totaling over a hundred. Afterwards, both sides withdrew from Xinchang and took refuge in the countryside. At noon, during the night's fierce battle, the Japanese army's Ogawa unit in Zhoupu received the report and dispatched over a hundred infantrymen, aided by twenty to thirty military police, to Xinchang to suppress the situation. However, in the darkness, they were unable to distinguish friend from foe. The puppet "army" became suspicious of each other and also fired upon the Japanese soldiers. The Japanese soldiers then joined in, indiscriminately opening fire, resulting in a chaotic battle. After dawn, the Japanese side counted their casualties, finding over thirty dead or wounded. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, a severely wounded man, resembling a junior officer, due to the inadequate medical facilities in Zhoupu, took the Shanghai-Nanhui train to Zhoujiadu, transferred to the South Pier, and boarded a ferry to Nanshi, ultimately heading to the Zhongshan Hospital in western Shanghai for treatment. Although the cause of the puppet troops' conflict is likely due to financial issues, with Zhang Miaogen not yet returning to Nanhui County, the Japanese side fears that the warring puppet "army" may mutiny again. Security is extremely tight, and both land and water transportation are temporarily blockaded.</p>

<p>Zhang Amao (also known as Kang Mei), a native of Chuansha, 31 years old, was the owner of the Yongyuan gambling den at No. 6 Le'an Lane, corner of Route des Soeurs in western Shanghai. Yesterday afternoon, around 8:40 PM, Zhang Amao exited the gambling den and walked south. As he passed the intersection of Nanjing West Road and Dibafa Road, a car with license number 10468 suddenly approached and followed Zhang. Six or seven men were seated inside the car. As the car drew near Zhang, the men pulled out pistols and fired three shots at Zhang. Zhang Amao, caught off guard, was hit by two bullets on the spot and collapsed to the ground. By the time nearby patrolmen arrived after hearing the shots, the car had already sped away. Upon checking Zhang's injuries, it was found that he had been shot once in the head and once in the mouth, with several front teeth dislodged by the bullets. Blood covered the ground. They immediately reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which dispatched detectives to investigate and pursue the assailants. Meanwhile, Zhang Amao was sent to the Bailong Hospital for treatment, but due to the severity of his injuries, he died on the way. The body was transferred to the coroner's office for examination. As of the time of writing, the car used by the perpetrators has not yet been found.</p>

The five or six money shops that had not yet reported submitted their reporting procedures to the association for review yesterday morning. A leading figure in the money industry told a reporter from Da Guang News yesterday that the preparation of funds by various remittance draft money shops has always been very solid. After the war, the current assets and circulating funds of each shop are still progressing towards prosperity. The drawing of remittance draft chits this time is purely to restrict withdrawals, prevent the escape of funds, strengthen the credit of legal tender, and curb unscrupulous individuals from profiting from foreign exchange speculation. This is a sign of improvement in China's finances and is by no means due to insufficient reserves of banks and money shops, requiring the drawing of this large amount of chits. As for the estimated amount of drafts required by each shop reported to the association, the total has already reached over 12 million, indeed exceeding the previously assumed amount of 10 million yuan. Moreover, there are still several money shops reporting that they do not need this kind of chit. If every shop were to need to draw them, even 20 million yuan of chits would be insufficient to allocate. All the remittance drafts drawn by each shop are merely a hypothetical number. Whether or not they can meet the amount to be drawn in future business is difficult to predict beforehand. It is estimated that after the reports from each shop are completed, the association plans to submit the matter to the executive committee or the members' general assembly for report.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Charity Lottery Tickets - Issued Today <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Drawing on September 4th</p>
<p>The Charity Lottery Tickets for Refugee Relief have been issued for eleven periods since their inception. Due to the widespread prizes and excellent reputation, they have gained deep trust from all sectors of society, so the sales volume in each period has always been over 150,000 yuan, greatly benefiting refugees. Now, because the previous sales agent, Da Gong Enterprise Company, is pursuing other businesses and has ceased sales, Father Rao Jiaju of the Lottery Ticket Committee, fearing that it would affect the lives of refugees, specially invited Mr. Xu Weizhou, a leading figure in the financial world, and philanthropist Mr. Ou Cheng, and others to organize Fengxing Company to continue sales. The report yesterday that a Mr. Ma organized and promoted guerrilla areas is not true. It is now heard that all procedures for the lottery tickets have been completed and will officially continue to be issued starting today. The drawing will still be held publicly at the Yiyuan Garden on September 4th. All banks and lottery ticket shops in this city will sell them uniformly. Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, recognizing that these lottery tickets are related to the relief of Chinese compatriots, have contacted many to promote sales in various regions of Southeast Asia.</p>

<p>The North-China Daily News reports that thieves in the Hongqiao area are apparently no longer concerned with the Shanghai Telephone Company's wires, but are stealing more valuable, yet more dangerous, high-voltage cables. These high-voltage cables are used by the Shanghai Power Company to supply electricity to residents and factories as far as Hongqiao Road. According to a member of the power company yesterday (27th), thieves are quite active and have stolen these valuable cables six times since July 11th. These individuals seem to be experienced in this field, not only possessing considerable electrical expertise but also undoubtedly having a complete set of wire-cutting tools. After an unsuccessful theft attempt on the night of July 24th, there were no further thefts. One Chinese person, while walking past a power company pole, did not notice a newly cut cable fallen to the ground, touched the cable, and died. The thieves, panicked and fleeing, did not bother to cut the other end of the cable to prevent the electric shock, leaving the Chinese person electrocuted on the road. Each stolen section has been within half a mile of the intersection of Warren Road and Lincoln Avenue, and each stolen section is no more than three or four feet long. The stolen areas are all within areas patrolled by the Japanese army, and the Shanghai Municipal Police are currently unable to operate in these areas. In order to prevent the cables from attracting the attention of thieves, the Shanghai Power Company is now replacing the stolen cables with thinner and cheaper cables, hoping to prevent further disruptions to the electricity supply, as it is believed that thieves will not be willing to risk their lives to steal less valuable cables.</p>

<p>Pedestrian Found with Pistol - Indicted for Endangering Public Safety</p>
<p>Western officers from the Jing'an Temple Police Station, along with Chinese officers Nos. 490, 1533, 228, and 3104, were conducting searches and patrols in their jurisdiction at 2:15 AM yesterday morning. As they were passing the Tangdian Lane area on Route des Soeurs in western Shanghai, they suddenly heard a gunshot. They immediately began investigating and saw a man approaching. The Chinese and Western officers believed that, given the late hour and the curfew, wandering alone was suspicious. They stopped him, searched him, and found a pistol and three bullets. They arrested him and took him to the police station. During interrogation, he claimed his name was Xu Asi, from Jiangbei. He claimed that he had bought the pistol from Li Xiaosi for twenty yuan at 3:00 PM yesterday. Because he didn't know if the pistol was good, he took it to the Suzhou Creek late at night and fired a shot into the sky before being arrested. He was ordered to be detained. At around 9:00 AM, he was escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang filed a public prosecution under Article 187 of the Criminal Code for endangering public safety, and stated the above circumstances, saying that it was still necessary to investigate whether the words of the defendant in the police station were reliable, or if there were other circumstances, so he requested permission to postpone the hearing. Judge Xiao Peishen reviewed the confession and ordered Xu Aji to be detained pending a hearing, postponed for seven days for further investigation.</p>

After more than a month, her condition did not improve, leading her to feel hopeless. At 10:00 PM on the 27th, she hanged herself with a belt from the iron bed frame in her hospital room. By the time the nurse discovered her, she had already died and could not be saved. They reported it to the French Police, who sent detectives to investigate. The body was taken down and transported to the coroner's office at Dalas Route for examination. The family was notified. Yesterday morning, a report was made to the Second Special Court, and the prosecutor and forensic doctor went to the office to confirm that the deceased had died by hanging. After the report investigated the situation, the body was claimed by her son, Hu Hongyuan, who signed a guarantee.</p>

<p>Providing Treatment and Medicine to Benefit the Poor and Sick</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Battle, mournful cries have filled the isolated island. With epidemics spreading, impoverished people afflicted with illness, constrained by economic hardship and unable to afford medical care, could only await death helplessly. Philanthropists Chen Shichang, Zhang Xuxian, Zhu Jing'an, and others, deeply saddened by this, specially donated funds to establish Renchang Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital at 29 Anshun Lane, Shanhai Pass Road (diagonally opposite Xiaocai Chang). The clinic operates from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM, charging only 20 cents for registration. Treatment and medicine are provided free of charge. Renowned physician Ding Jiwan has been appointed as the hospital's director, and Guan Liping as the director of medical affairs. However, as the project is in its early stages and limited by its location, only an outpatient department is currently available. It is said that the initiators are continuing their efforts, and a large building will soon be constructed to achieve a perfect goal. The hospital is scheduled to open on the 29th of this month, which is truly good news for the isolated island society.</p>

<h3 id="e109">Finance International News Clears Up Gold Plummets <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold black market situation: Gold prices have been rising sharply in recent days, and have been rising continuously for four days, a total increase of 395 yuan. However, yesterday a sudden reaction occurred, and the decline was also very drastic, reaching a low of 3,690 yuan before the evening close. As a result, it plummeted by 170 yuan. This was largely because the US Senate passed the abolition of the US-Japan commercial treaty signed in 1911. In addition, it was reported that Britain would also take the same step. Therefore, the foreign exchange market in this city gradually became clear, and most of those who had long held firm intentions began to have active thoughts and thoughts. Bullish forces, such as securities firms, wealthy individuals, and gold shops, sold off one after another. Although a certain bank (on behalf of foreign firms) and Hong Kong speculators continued to add positions, the price was ultimately weak and could not rise. However, the tight foreign exchange report in the middle once triggered buying interest, which briefly reached 3,820 yuan, but ultimately closed at 3,695 yuan. Trading activity was still strong, at around 1,500 taels. The price of gold jewelry in gold shops fluctuated, ultimately falling by 15 yuan. The price of customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Plummets 170 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the morning, the initial sentiment for each tael (ten taels) was weak. Coupled with the hard foreign exchange report, those who wanted to enter the market were even more hesitant. As a result, it was shrouded in a general selling mood, and it opened sharply lower by 145 yuan. A certain money exchange sold 20 taels to securities firms and gold shops, at a price of 3,720 yuan each. Then, it sold 10 taels to a gold shop for 3,710 yuan. Later, it was heard that foreign exchange had tightened, stimulating buying interest. Gold shops and retail investors rushed to buy at low prices, and it soon rebounded by 110 yuan. A certain gold shop (on behalf of Hong Kong speculators) bought 20 taels from a gold shop for 3,820 yuan. After that, although a certain bank (on behalf of foreign firms) aggressively bought more than 100 taels, securities firms, gold shops, and floating longs all rushed to sell first, and the market momentum weakened again, retreating by 60 yuan. A gold shop sold 50 taels to a money exchange for 3,770 yuan. At that time, a certain money exchange aggressively bought more than 100 taels, and the selling pressure had decreased, rebounding by 35 yuan. A certain money exchange bought 50 taels from a peer for 3,795 yuan. After that, the bullish forces of the securities firms suddenly turned and came out of the cage. Although a certain bank (on behalf of foreign firms) and a certain gold shop continued to absorb, the number of sellers was still high, and the market price fell by 45 yuan. A money exchange sold 50 taels to a certain gold shop at a price of 3,750 yuan. After 11:30 AM, the securities firms stopped selling and watched, and another money exchange aggressively bought more than 100 taels, raising the price by 50 yuan. Securities firms bought 10 taels from cash gold shops, and money exchanges did 50 taels of mutual business at 3,800 yuan, which was the closing price for the morning session. In the afternoon, the underlying trend weakened again, and the opening was 30 yuan lower. A gold shop sold 50 taels to a money exchange for 3,770 yuan. Then, it rebounded by 10 yuan, and gold shops did 20 taels of mutual business at 3,780 yuan. At that time, due to the hard foreign exchange report and the gold shops' competition to sell, the market momentum weakened and plunged by 90 yuan, breaking into the 3,700 yuan level. Money exchanges did 50 taels of mutual business at 3,690 yuan, which was the lowest price of the day. Later, a money exchange sold 50 taels to a gold shop for 3,695 yuan, which was the closing price for the evening session. As a result, it fell back by 170 yuan compared to the previous day, with a fluctuation of 130 yuan throughout the day. The cash gold of the local brand was 10 yuan higher than the spot gold, and the current standard gold was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and neither was traded.</p>
<p>Gold Jewelry Lists 15 Yuan Lower</p>
<p>At the beginning, the large firms still listed the selling price of gold jewelry at 390 yuan per tael. But by 9:45 AM, due to the spot gold opening lower by more than 100 yuan, they also listed it 15 yuan lower. Five minutes later, it rebounded by 5 yuan, and at 10:00 AM, it was listed 5 yuan higher again. At 10:50 AM, it was listed 5 yuan lower, and at 11:37 AM, it rebounded by 5 yuan again. At 2:30 PM, it was listed 5 yuan lower, and at 3:15 PM, it was listed 5 yuan lower again. After that, there were no changes, and as a result, it was listed 15 yuan lower. It is estimated that the large firms changed to list 375 yuan, the new firms listed 375 yuan, and the new firms listed 373 yuan. There was still no fixed price for purchases.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Stable Foreign Exchange <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged. Since the US-Japan commercial treaty was canceled the day before yesterday, most operators in the British and American exchange black market believed that it would be quite beneficial to our country, so people's hearts gradually stabilized, causing the market momentum to reach stability and present a hovering trend. At the beginning, the market was hard because Western merchant Sassoon and the foreign telegraph company had strong selling intentions. Later, because foreign firms frequently came to pull together, it once became tight. Finally, the Indian Bank Company came to throw it again, causing the results to return slightly harder. There were many swaps for July and August in the middle of the day. At noon, American Bank Chase posted 875 American dollars, which is equivalent to a monthly interest rate (excluding commission) of one cent and one and a half cents. In the afternoon, Chase posted 8125 American dollars again, which is equivalent to a monthly interest rate (excluding commission) of about one cent and six mils. Finally, Chase was only willing to post 75 American dollars, which is equivalent to a monthly interest rate (excluding commission) of only nine mils. Trading activity was flat throughout the day.</p>
<p>Sassoon and Foreign Telegraph Company Have Selling</p>
<p>In the early morning, as London's spot and forward large bars rebounded by 0.0625, New York silver prices remained fixed, London bullion remained unchanged, the exchange rate of British against American remained unchanged, it was flat against Shanghai by 25, and flat against France. The exchange rate of American against British fell by 0.0625, against Shanghai fell by 45 cents, and against France shrank by 0.0625. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained the same as before. The bank's spot selling price opened in the morning: British gold at 4 pounds 3125 shillings, and American exchange at 8 yuan 375, Luo Qianshou, British loose 125, and American hard 1875. After opening, Western merchant Sassoon and foreign telegraph companies competed to throw and sell. Moreover, foreign firms lacked funds to settle accounts, causing the market momentum to become looser. It is estimated that the foreign telegraph company and Sassoon successively sold spot British gold to HSBC and McGalli, hardening from 4 pounds 3125 shillings to 375, and also spot American exchange softened from 8 yuan 375 to half yuan. When HSBC's listed prices were announced, there were no changes at all. And when the silver balancing tax was announced, it was still exempt. After that, foreign firms suddenly had more accounts to settle, and Western merchant Sassoon and foreign telegraph companies had stopped selling. In addition, HSBC and other foreign firms were unwilling to sell cheaply, causing the situation to suddenly turn tight and soft. It is estimated that the foreign firms pulled in spot British gold from HSBC and McGalli for only 4 pounds 25 shillings, and purchased spot American exchange from a certain bank for only 8 yuan 25. Near noon, there were some swap transactions. It is estimated that American Bank Chase sold this month and entered August, estimating that the subsidy to arbitrageurs was 875 American dollars, which is equivalent to a monthly interest rate (excluding commission) of one cent and one and a half cents. By the time of the afternoon close, the bank's spot selling price was British gold at 4 pounds 28125 shillings, and American exchange at 8 yuan 3125, which was a rebound of 0.03125 British and a softening of 0.0625 American compared to the morning opening.</p>
<p>Swap Transactions Quite Frequent</p>
<p>In the later market, because the Indian Bank Company came to throw again, and the foreign firms' account settlements became clearer, the market momentum became more stable. It is estimated that the Indian Bank Company sold spot British gold at 4 pounds 3125 shillings and 375 shillings, and spot American exchange at 8 yuan 375 and half yuan to HSBC and other foreign firms. Then, speculators spat out American exchange for August at 7 yuan 625 to a certain bank. At that time, there were many arbitrageurs. It was heard that Chase sold this month and entered August again, estimating that the subsidy to wealthy merchants was 8125 American dollars, which is equivalent to a monthly interest rate (excluding commission) of about one cent and six mils. After entering the market, it was heard that Chase was only willing to post 75. Until the evening close, the bank's spot selling price was British gold at 4 pounds 3125 shillings, and American exchange at 8 yuan 375. As a result, it was a loosening of 125 British and a hardening of 1875 American compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Shanghai Exchange Rate Drops 5 Yuan</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 28th Telegram, the exchange market opened firmly today, with no movement against British and American, the Shanghai exchange rate fell 15 yuan, and the Japanese exchange rate loosened 25.

<p>How Can They Be Used Universally?</p>
<p>Regarding banknotes with place names from outside the city, (except for Tianjin, Shandong, and Wuhan, which are not allowed to circulate in the market due to the prevention of speculation, and are only allowed to be remitted to the place of origin or the mainland, this city should use them uniformly. However, various merchants and banks refuse to accept them. After being repeatedly recorded in this newspaper, and the local news in yesterday's newspapers, regarding "banknotes with place names from outside the city, the Shanghai market generally uses them at full value, and no banks or money shops refuse to accept them.") This newspaper has again investigated from various sources and found that most merchants and money shops still refuse to accept them. When asked for their reasons, they said that they were afraid that the issuing banks in this city would not allow them to be accepted or exchanged in the future, causing losses. However, the banks concerned still refuse to publish a formal announcement in various newspapers, and only use irresponsible wording for publicity, which inevitably makes people more suspicious. If they are truly determined to facilitate the holders of the banknotes, they should immediately publish an announcement in the newspaper that they will be used uniformly and send a letter to the two associations of money shops and silver firms, stating that they will be responsible for the exchange in the future. The money shop association should send a letter to all member banks and firms to use them uniformly. In this way, the city's citizens will be willing to accept banknotes with place names from outside the city and commercial banks, and there will be no more discrimination as is currently the case.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Foreign Currencies Begin to Fall <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currencies: Due to the impact of the abolition of the US-Japan commercial treaty, the market atmosphere improved, and foreign exchange loosened. Spot gold fell sharply. The supply of British and American gold pounds and gold tickets has been smooth, and the market situation has loosened and declined. Hong Kong franc tickets, etc., have all returned. However, the rebound after the big rise is still weak. If the international situation develops and there is economic assistance, then foreign currencies may continue to loosen. The demand for Japanese gold tickets is scarce, and the decline is quite drastic, with the evening market at 1 yuan 1 jiao 1 fen. Korean tickets also fell sharply, with the evening market at 8 jiao 9 fen. There were few public transactions. Only Xiangfeng sold and Wankang bought 200 yuan of American gold tickets. Yesterday's market prices: British gold pounds fell 2 yuan, British gold tickets fell 1 yuan 8 jiao, American gold pounds fell 1 yuan, American gold tickets fell 9 jiao, Hong Kong tickets fell 1 jiao 6 fen, franc tickets fell 5 li, Singapore tickets fell jiao, Dutch tickets and Philippine tickets each fell 3 jiao, Canadian tickets fell 5 jiao, Australian gold tickets fell 1 yuan, and other currencies remained unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Large Bars Slightly Higher Indian Silver Recent Slight Decline <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>London, 27th Telegram, the silver market has some shorts covering, and the supply is low. The market is flat, and the closing is slightly harder. The Indian quote is 0.0625 higher than the listed price, and someone came to inquire, but no trading was seen later. Large silver bars, the spot and forward rates both rebounded by 0.0625. New York silver telegram, the American spot rate remained fixed as before. Also, Mumbai silver telegram, the Indian silver market was calm, the spot and August rates both shrunk by one anna, and the September rate had no rise or fall. A total of 75 transaction orders were made, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Discount Rate Returns Low by 10 Yuan <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's discount rate for bank drafts and bills was slightly lower. The morning rate for every 1,000 yuan was around 250 yuan, and in the afternoon it rose to 260 yuan again. The final rate was 255 yuan, which was 10 yuan lower than the previous day. The money industry association's call rate remained flat, opening at 2 jiao in both the morning and afternoon markets.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Securities US Abolishes Japan Trade Agreement Domestic Debt Excitement Foreign Stocks Depend on Foreign Exchange <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The black market for securities rebounded by about one yuan yesterday. This is because the abolition of the US-Japan trade agreement, in this precarious situation, is no less than a light in a dark valley. Although the effect is still six months away, China has gained unlimited spiritual comfort. Foreign exchange is long, gold is falling, and public bonds are rising. This can also be said to be the effect of a telegram. However, the rise in public bonds is not natural, and the counter trading accounts for half of it. Therefore, its trend first rises and then falls, and cannot be established. Most market psychology believes that Category C is high at 44 yuan, and it may not be easy to break out, and low at 40 yuan, and it may not be easy to enter. In this three or four yuan high and low hovering, speculators use it, and are passively endless. Most investors are deeply rooted. In this situation, the market price fluctuations are already limited. The interest payment situation is how, tomorrow or the day after tomorrow will be revealed. Large rises and falls will be at the beginning of next week. Yesterday, Category C and E were more active, and the rest fluctuated very little. At the beginning, the 14th, 20th, and 64th were bought, raising the price by about one yuan. The opening continued to rise by two or three jiao, but still failed to reach the number of four yuan. Later, Tongkang, Hengyu, Datong, Shuntai and others continued to sell, and the market could not support it, hitting the three yuan level, to 6 yuan 6 jiao. Although Xieda and Maofeng had eating in at the close, the supply was still greater than the demand and the market was weak. As a result, it still rose by 8 jiao half to 1 yuan 6 jiao. It is heard that the issue of principal and interest has been telegraphed by the Ministry of Finance according to the original plan, but whether it is legal currency or exchange is still undecided. Probably there is no big problem, and the future should be better. The total turnover was about 700,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading, 50 shares of Dachunghua Match Company were traded, at a legal currency price of 12 yuan 1 jiao, which is an increase of 3 jiao compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The Public Industry Association reported that yesterday was the last day of the week's trading, and more stocks were released on the market. Although there was this selling pressure, the general prices were still able to support it, and the rubber stocks changed slightly. The most intense declines were in the electricity six two preferred shares and the Kaiping shares. The Wheelock shares and telephone shares were slightly higher than the previous day's low price. The market atmosphere this week was particularly disappointing and tasteless. Now that foreign exchange is tight, the value of rubber stocks should increase, but due to other reasons, they have suffered a setback. It seems that there cannot be an accurate market at present, and we must wait for the foreign exchange to have a stable foothold, and for currency capital to be able to loosen for ordinary commerce and investment, instead of being used exclusively for foreign exchange speculation or changing the use of foreign exchange.</p>
<p>London British merchants' Far East companies' stock market prices on the 27th of this month (Thursday) were generally stable, but the Gula Ke Lin Rubber rose by seven pence half, with a price of seventeen shillings six pence.</p>
<p>The listing price of the China foreign debt on the 27th of this month (Thursday), the upper and lower grades of each public debt remained unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Yarn and Cotton Weaker Speculative Activity Decreases Yarn Market Hovers on the Horizontal Line <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market first rose and then weakened, and the trend hovered on the horizontal line. This is because the false rumors of the day before were greatly calmed down. Because the United States and Japan announced the abolition of the commercial treaty, general speculators were slightly hit, and the mood of activity was not as strong as the day before. Therefore, the opening momentum was good and continued to rise. Then, it was heard that foreign exchange was long and the exchange rate was relaxed, and it weakened again. As for the actual demand, Hong Kong firms' purchases of 10-count coarse yarn are still unabated, and the market situation is still stable. However, a batch of unpopular yarns, such as 20-count Five Fortunes and Shepherd, are also relatively cheap.</p>
<p>The situation of spot yarn: At the beginning of the morning opening, the momentum of the previous day was carried forward, and the popularity was tight. The opening price of 20-count Shuangma was 4 or 5 yuan higher than the closing price of the previous day, but it was still similar to the black market price in the afternoon. The price of 20-count Shuangma outside the wharf was 565 yuan, and the price of the wharf bill was 555 yuan. After a while, it was heard that gold had returned to a small level and the exchange rate was easing, and the popularity immediately weakened. Retail investors, seeing the bad atmosphere, vomited one after another. The price of 20-count Shuangma outside the wharf fell back to 559 yuan, and the price of the wharf bill was 546 yuan half. The trading activity in and out of the market recently has been greatly reduced compared with the past, probably due to the impact of tight silver roots. The closing was also stable. It is found that the semi-day transaction statistics are 808 packages, and the afternoon transactions on the previous day were 70 packages. The market situation is not very different from the previous day. The factory opened 120 packages of 20-count special Jincheng from Yongan Factory, at a price of 640 yuan. Hong Kong firms entered. The amount of each bangkou purchased is listed below:</p>
<p>Tonghang 485 Hong Kong 310</p>
<p>Mainland 13 Statistics 808</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market in the north of Tianjin has some purchases, which stabilizes people's hearts, but the ups and downs in the middle are still the most active transactions in the coming month. The local business is mediocre, and the current price of 20-count Yueqin is 430 yuan, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Tianjin Fine Cotton Continues to Arrive South <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market continues to show progress, but actual prices remain relatively stable. Opening prices are more than ten yuan cheaper than those of foreign firms' orders. These cotton prices were all settled when exchange rates were favorable, resulting in substantial profits for the cotton companies. Now, the cotton has been loaded and arrived in Shanghai, and it is difficult to quickly find sufficient legal tender to take delivery. Due to environmental constraints, they are willing to accept lower prices for immediate cash. Factories are happy to buy these bargains, creating a win-win situation. This is the biggest factor in the recent development of cotton sales. As for Tianjin Chinese fine cotton, the amount being sent south via modified postal packages is increasing daily. Factories have been short of this type of cotton for a long time, and manufacturers welcome it because it can be used as raw material for 32-count yarns. It is said that there are still ample cotton reserves in the countryside, but it is regrettable that they cannot be fully transported out of the country due to being under foreign occupation. Ninety bales of cotton have arrived in Tongzhou from northern Jiangsu. The current cotton situation is listed below:</p>
<p>Laigon Cotton 103.25 Traders bought 200 pieces</p>
<p>Brazilian Cotton 127.00 Traders bought 319 pieces</p>
<p>White Locke 105.00 107.00 Traders bought 800 pieces</p>
<p>Fine Cotton Bales 106.00 Yufeng bought 500 pieces</p>
<p>Pingoer Cotton 82.00 Traders bought 200 pieces</p>
<p>Tianjin Postal Package Cotton 129.00 Traders bought 300 pieces</p>
<p>Another report: Foreign cotton transactions in Shanghai, except for Japanese factories, have very low inventory levels, reportedly insufficient for even one month's use. Therefore, there have been some small spot transactions in the market recently. However, the payment terms are all after August 20th.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton market prices: Yesterday, the New York cotton market weakened due to the US government's announcement of the cancellation of the US-Japan commercial treaty. Telegrams from Liverpool also reported declines. Southern sellers followed suit. Subsequently, the banking sector aggressively bought in the market. European buyers were more enthusiastic due to US cotton subsidies. Washington yesterday also signed agreements with France and Switzerland to sell 175,000 bales of US cotton. This cotton is intended for wartime needs, and France and Switzerland cannot freely sell it within five years. Consequently, the cotton is reportedly six yuan cheaper per bale compared to the market price. Yesterday, New York fell 10 points, while India rose one rupee, and Egypt rose eight points.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Piece Goods: Frequent Delivery of This Month's Futures <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth</p>
<p>Yarn prices are soaring, and the cost for factories differs greatly from the current market, resulting in very enthusiastic trading. Prices rise with every purchase. Yesterday, broadcloth, straight drill, and woolen cloth each rose by 3 to 6 jiao per bolt. New Chun Yuan silk opened at 17 yuan, up 5 jiao from before. Colored cloth and colored twill rose by 2 to 3 jiao. White goods, fine twill, and coarse cloth uniformly increased by 5 fen to 2.5 jiao. Current sales are strongest to Southeast Asian buyers in places like Siam and Singapore, who continue to purchase over 3,000 bolts of colored cloth, colored twill, bleached cloth, and hemp yarn. Agents from Hong Kong are handling 40 to 50 packages of fine twill. Because the end of the month is approaching, there are many deliveries of expiring futures contracts. Speculators are unwilling to invest due to difficulty in raising funds. Outside investors are slightly more active, with over 200 pieces of fine weave, coarse cloth, fine cloth, broadcloth, and tribute silk being traded. Shandong buyers from Yantai in the north continue to purchase over 50 pieces of Dasheng Yihua 16-pound coarse cloth. Wholesale dealers on this street are handling over 100 packages of coarse cloth and twill.</p>
<p>Eastern Piece Goods</p>
<p>In the morning market, fine cloth and fine twill continued to rise due to the end-of-month short squeeze. Spot prices for 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth once opened at 15.75 yuan, but demand weakened in the afternoon, falling back to 15.35 yuan. However, next month's futures still require 15.8 yuan. Other brands are holding firm. Northern buyers continue to add small amounts, with over 200 pieces being traded. There are not many transactions on this street, but traders still expect prices to rise.</p>
<p>Twenty pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong on the 29th.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Food: Rice Merchants Use Market Closure as a Threat; People's Food Controlled <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>—Wuhu Reopening Imminent—</p>
<p>Domestic Rice: Shanghai rice merchants have recently used market closure as a threat, intending to achieve their goal of manipulating prices and harming the people's food supply. Yesterday, no samples were displayed. Only Jiantou rice at 16 yuan and Bianyuan rice at 22 yuan were traded. The total volume traded was over 2,000 bags. No rice arrived from various sources in the river areas, and only over 1,000 bags of Che Lun Baozi rice arrived. If rice prices in Shanghai fall, local sentiment will naturally improve, and supply will naturally increase. Moreover, the amount of rice stored in Shanghai warehouses has suddenly decreased to over 200,000 bags. It is worth noting whether some of it has been transshipped to other ports. With only one month until the new harvest, and the rice situation being as it is, the authorities should prepare in advance.</p>
<p>Imported Indica: Because the reopening of Wuhu next month is likely to materialize, sellers' buying interest has weakened. Previously absent Suchi Indica and Gao Indica rice were displayed for sale yesterday, but buyers stopped hoarding, and shops only took low-priced goods below 16 yuan. The market immediately declined, but the extent of the decline varied greatly due to the different quality of the goods, falling by 5 to 6 fen, 1 jiao, or more than 2 jiao compared to the previous market. About 2,000 bags were traded.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice: Yesterday, sellers still quoted the original price of 25.5 yuan, but buyers only offered 25 yuan for the new Saigon rice due to the softening of imported Indica, so the two sides could not agree.</p>
<h3 id="e120">With Active Sales to External Buyers, Flour Mill Prices Will Increase <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, the market was quite bullish, likely because external buyers' transactions have gradually become active. Southeast Asian buyers have a good appetite, and North China buyers also have a good appetite because the Tianjin exchange rate is relatively favorable. It is said that Tianjin buyers have already opened a large batch of repurchases, with prices comparable to mill prices. The market has turned firm. Therefore, millers were more determined to sell yesterday. In addition to supplying the daily needs of this street, they are still restricting wholesale sales to external buyers. It is expected that mill prices will officially increase by 5 fen or 1 jiao soon.</p>
<p>Wheat: There is not much supply because inland production prices are quite firm, while prices in Shanghai are mediocre, and only speculators favor the sales destination. Traders have inevitably reduced shipments. Yesterday, Huafen Mill's needs remained quiet, and sales channels for Japanese mills were also weak. Only speculators bought a total of over 2,000 bags of wheat from Guandian, Nanjing, Danyang, Kunshan, Weiting, Changzhou, etc., with prices ranging from 6.95 yuan to 6.45 yuan. The market was flat and weak.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Miscellaneous Grains: New Yellow Soybeans Enter the Market; Cowhide Yellow at 11.2 Yuan <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>New yellow soybeans, Cowhide Yellow from Lingkou (not the Changzhou variety), were shipped by the Japanese firm Xintai in 160 bags yesterday. This variety, produced in the Changzhou area, is of superior quality. Although the quality is only about 70% of the best, the seeds are uniform and complete. They were all distributed on this street at a price of 11.2 yuan. (Note: The opening price of the first batch to market last year was only 8.45 yuan.) Dalian soybeans are in a stable position. Yesterday, Hong Kong buyers on this street bought 3 to 4 carloads at prices ranging from 11.5 yuan to 11.38 yuan. The potential of Hankou Zhazao soybeans is feared to be suppressed by the new soybeans because the quality of Zhazao soybeans is similar to that of Cowhide Yellow. Yesterday, the market nominally quoted the original price of 10.02 yuan, but actual sales were very small.</p>
<p>On the 28th, 2,300 bags of soybeans were shipped to Singapore, 4,130 bags of soybeans, 2,470 bags of shelled peanuts, 130 cans of peanut oil, and 1,340 cans of sesame oil were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>

<p>According to telegrams from London yesterday, nearby August sugar was at 7 shillings for a small lot of 75, and forward contracts remained at the original price, with no changes. The Shanghai Sugar Association's quotation was unchanged for spot 24 coarse white sugar. Re-exported goods rose by 1 jiao to 25.9 yuan. Taikoo granulated sugar rose by 7 to 8 jiao. West Wharf's B mark was 38.3 yuan, OW mark was 318 yuan, CX mark was 37.5 yuan, DY mark was 37.1 yuan, and HX mark was 36.8 yuan. Spot Dutch red sugar rose by 6 jiao to 28.8 yuan. Several dozen bags of Chao Bang's clear Chung Huang sugar were offered at 23.8 yuan, and over 300 pieces of mixed road green sugar were offered at 22 yuan. Several dozen bags of Ming Jing red sugar were offered at 29.5 yuan. One hundred and fifty bags of sugar arrived from Hong Kong yesterday.</p>

<p>Glutinous rice twigs have recently become scarce in inventory, and the market has soared. A dozen or so boxes were offered the day before yesterday, reaching a new high price of 220 yuan, an increase of 40 yuan from before. The market outlook is extremely firm.</p>

<p>Overseas silk markets: Yokohama fell 40 yuan due to the US-Japan commercial treaty, and forward contracts fell 34 yuan. New York spot Japanese silk fell 2 fen, while Chinese silk remained unchanged. Standard silk fell 8 fen recently. Considering that the current legal tender is strong at 100 yuan, overseas sales were sluggish yesterday. In Lyon, both Chinese and Japanese silk were sold at the original price.</p>
<p>Local silk market: Because silk prices have reached their peak, those with goods on hand are not waiting, leading to slight discrepancies in Japanese silk prices. White mills are selling both ungraded and 7-8 grade silk at 3,100 yuan. Observing the situation, it can be seen that silk prices are not very normal. Yesterday, exports of raw silk seemed to have stopped. Overseas accounts showed price declines of nearly 30 to 40 yuan, and most were forward contracts, so silk merchants were generally unwilling to dump their goods. Yin Zhuang traded 40 dan of Qian Jin silk yesterday, with a slight increase in price. It is hoped that actual sales will improve.</p>

<h3 id="e125">Silver and Banking Industry Colleagues Organize a Consumer Cooperative <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>— A Wanderer</p>
<p>Solving the threat to livelihood to seek welfare for colleagues. National goods manufacturers sympathizing and offering special discounts.</p>
<p>In the current period of abnormally high living costs, every salaried class is facing a frustrating period of limited means to increase income and no way to reduce expenses. The organization of a consumer cooperative by various groups and enthusiastic individuals is naturally a cause for great rejoicing. Perhaps due to environmental factors, the colleagues of the Yinlianhui (Silver Union Association) can deeply feel the need for such an organization and have quickly established it, which makes us even happier. However, based on Mr. Wanderer's article, it seems that their customers are limited to members and colleagues in the silver and banking industry, and they cannot universally treat general customers. This seems regrettable. Hopefully, they can take a further step to seek welfare for all Shanghai compatriots, which would be truly meritorious. At the same time, it is hoped that other more powerful groups can also quickly organize themselves to enable all Shanghai citizens to overcome this difficult period. (Editor)</p>
<p>Since this newspaper published "Letter from Nineteen Teachers" and "Echoes of Urgent Calls," general small clerks have shared a wave of sympathetic tears. The tragic state of their lives is vividly presented in every corner of society. The call for automatically tightening belts has further exposed the difficulties in the lives of the salaried class.</p>
<p>The re-tightening of foreign exchange in the past three months has stimulated the unlimited soaring of prices. Merchants have taken advantage of the situation to greatly increase the prices of their inventories, especially the price increases of necessities, giving clerks a great threat!</p>
<p>What guarantees are there for the lives of the salaried class in this isolated island? The government's power cannot suppress rising prices. Although many wise authorities understand the actual difficulties in the lives of clerks and subsidize some wartime living allowances, the subsidies ultimately cannot keep up with the mayor's living index. Therefore, the entire clerk class is still threatened by a terrifying fate.</p>
<p>Here, I would like to introduce an organization that uses practical action and the power of unity to reduce the living burden of colleagues - the Silver and Banking Industry Consumer Cooperative, so that clerks throughout the city can emulate the silver and banking industry's spirit of automatically helping others and sincerely cooperating, actively and automatically organize themselves, and shoulder the responsibility of reducing living costs and providing welfare!</p>
<p>In October of last year, the Silver Industry Friendship Association, a unique amateur group in the silver and banking industry, initiated the organization of a consumer cooperative. At that time, more than 200 people enthusiastically participated. Later, it received the support of more than 20 seniors in the silver and banking industry, such as Xu Jici, Lin Kanghou, Qin Runqing, Pei Yunqing, and Wu Yunzhai, which made the purpose of the initiation more deeply rooted in every colleague in the silver and banking industry. During the second resolution seeking movement in March and April, the total number of members surged to nearly 1,000, and the number of shares reached more than 2,600 yuan. This great achievement gave great pleasure and excitement to many enthusiastic staff, so it was decided to convene a founding meeting at the Bank Association on May 21st.</p>
<p>The cooperative under the expectations of 1,000 members requires them to be able to relieve the dual pressure of life, so 600 outstanding young people from the silver and banking industry gathered on the day of the founding meeting to discuss their own welfare-related careers. The charter and many proposals were passed on the spot.</p>
<p>The company has undergone two months of full preparation time and is now scheduled to start business tomorrow (30th). The address is in the Friendship Association, although the location is very narrow. However, it is said that they have already been contacting outside warehouses and offices. Even under the current circumstances, telephone purchases should not be a major problem due to the size of the company address.</p>
<p>The most difficult thing is that the price of goods has risen by 30% to 50% compared to two months ago. So, under the principle of reducing selling prices and serving members, how will the cooperative equip members with the goods they need? Because the items sold on the market are mostly inventory, and the newly created cooperative is all new goods, how can the selling price be reduced? However, under the leadership of their director, Mr. Pan Yangyao, they also successfully obtained the sympathy of many national goods manufacturers, giving them special discounts, and even selling them to the cooperative at prices before the price increase.</p>
<p>Now they have purchased a large batch of white rice and coal briquettes, as well as laundry soap, Wutou brand soy sauce, and other daily household items such as towels, socks, mosquito coils, glassware, and toilet paper, providing for the needs of 1,000 members and 10,000 silver and banking industry colleagues. In the inevitable difficult process at this stage, they will receive some living security and reduce the threat of rising prices.</p>
<p>In order to solemnly handle new business and attract society's attention to the lives of employees, they specially invited Mr. Lin Kanghou to perform the opening ceremony, and asked the authorities of various firms to regularly supervise and care for them, so that they can do some truly beneficial work for their colleagues.</p>

<p>— Ru Hua</p>
<p>"Only Angels Have Wings"</p>
<p>Produced by Columbia, shown at the Da Guangming Theater</p>
<p>Films with aviation as their theme, whether to encourage people to be loyal to the country or to their duties, are always worthy of praise. "Heroic Lover" writes about a group of young pilots who are loyal to their duties. They risk danger in dense fog to fly planes to deliver mail, and the sincere friendship of this group of young people. However, "Heroic Lover" committed a common flaw of general films, that is, the lack of unity in the story: The encounter between pilot Zuo Yi and Pony, and their visit together, and Zuo Yi's death in a plane crash, can form a separate segment; Mike Bo's joining the aviation team is another segment. Although the playwright uses Pony's passionate love for Card as the medium connecting the two, there is always a gap that cannot communicate with each other.</p>
<p>The director's skill is quite high in handling this complex and extremely tense story. First, because of the monotony of the background, he rendered the local color very thickly. This is his cleverness. For example: when he began to introduce the port of Baranca in South America, the streets shrouded in dense fog, the sketches of tropical people, the special customs of small bars, music, songs... all fully outlined the unique mood of the tropics, and finally, he used quiet singing to accompany Card's emotional conflict, which is even more lovely.</p>
<p>The romance between Card and Pony is written very vaguely, and because of the occurrence of many tense scenes, the medium that the playwright used to connect the two segments is even more powerless. As for the thrilling scenes in the air, perhaps too many films of this kind have been seen. I think that the plane crash in the later scenes is not as moving as the one in which Zuo Yi was killed.</p>
<p>The scene where Zuo Yi was killed is like this: Zuo Yi was very happy after meeting Pony; suddenly, he was ordered to fly a plane to deliver mail; the sky was heavily foggy. Card ordered him to temporarily return to the airfield via radio, and land after the fog cleared; Card, Pony and colleagues responded via radio near the airfield; the sound of the plane got closer and closer; the searchlight was on; the plane was forced to land on the ground. Card shouted "Rise!"; the crowd was tense; the plane landed abruptly; a huge sound was heard, and the ambulance was dispatched; Card and Pony were in pain; although there was a front-facing shot of Zuo Yi's plane crash later in the scene, the suffocating atmosphere reached its peak. Card, the commander-in-chief of Craig Gland, was quite calm. Pony, played by Keith Arthur, is just cute.</p>

<p>Indeed, undertaking construction projects is his profession, focusing on everything in his profession, and it cannot disturb their marriage. When building the factory building, he also built a villa. Although this Mr. He had said to his two daughters: "That villa does not need to be very large, just enough for their family and daughters to live in temporarily." Mr. He's intention was because Shanghai was too lively. Therefore, he wanted to leave Shanghai and find a quiet place to build several houses as a place for rest. However, he could not be too far away from Shanghai, so that he could get to Shanghai in two or three hours if something happened. Mr. He's two daughters felt that our factory base was here, and the villa was also here, which was the most appropriate thing. And it is not very far from Shanghai. This Freedom Village is quiet in the midst of the bustling city, and it also meets the conditions of my father, and my father will definitely agree. It's just that the villa, although my father said it doesn't need to be too large, should not be too small. Because my father's current occupation is to handle various international trade matters, and he has many wealthy foreign businessmen and big buyers to deal with. Occasionally, if he invites them to take a day trip to the suburbs, he can also invite them to his home, so this house can be regarded as our country villa. This kind of country villa is common in Europe and America. Therefore, their intention is that the house does not need to be too large, but it needs a large garden. The garden does not need to be too luxurious, but it needs a large lawn. A place where garden parties can be held in the summer to accommodate dozens of guests is necessary. There is also one more thing. Originally, Mr. He and his two daughters came out of their home, but Mr. He's mother and her younger brother were still in Guangzhou. This mother is not the biological mother of the two Mr. He's daughters. The mother who gave birth to the twins of Mr. He's daughters has already passed away. But the mother in Guangzhou at the moment is a stepmother. They also have two younger brothers, one who is eleven years old this year, and one who is eight years old this year, but they do not have any younger sisters. These two younger brothers are still studying in elementary school, so Mr. He did not bring them to Shanghai. Now that there is a villa in Shanghai, this stepmother may bring her two younger brothers here. Even if they don't live here permanently, it is perfectly fine to live here for dozens of days, or to play for a month or two in the summer vacation. In that case, the house must also be prepared, and it cannot be too cramped. Therefore, the general situation of the construction of this villa must be asked of my father. If my father does not have any familiar construction engineers in Shanghai, then you can tell my father and entrust Lin Jiancheng to design and make samples. (164)</p>

<p>— Rui Peng</p>
<p>Because inland transportation is blocked and transportation is inconvenient, and few national goods factories have moved to the inland, the goods are all transported from various places, so the prices in Kunming are soaring endlessly. Not to mention imported goods, even local native products are so expensive that people are speechless. Just looking at the following daily necessities, people can't help but sigh. Toothpaste is 8 jiao per tube. Soap is 1 yuan per bar.</p>
<p>Toothbrush (ordinary) is 1 yuan per piece. Snow cream is 1.6 yuan per bottle.</p>
<p>Rice price is 32 yuan per stone. Pork is 8 jiao per catty.</p>
<p>Western-style shirts (poplin) are 7 yuan per piece. (Spun silk) is 10 yuan per piece.</p>
<p>(Twill) is 6 yuan per piece.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the Shanghai factories of national goods migrating to the inland is not only necessary, but also an urgent matter.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Joy (7) <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Christ's truth is broad, profound, and refined. Why waste pen ink on just the two words "joy"? Indeed, the two words "joy" are the most reliable and accurate experience for Christians, so it is necessary to speak of joy first. When the Holy Apostle Paul wrote letters, he spent more than 3,000 words specifically on the two words "joy" (Philippians), but joy is most important to the true way. If someone says: I believe in Christ, but I don't have joy. I say: You don't have the initial experience yet, so you can't talk about Christ's true way, because there is a problem with your faith. Furthermore, someone says: I believe in Christ, and my joy is sometimes strong and sometimes weak, sometimes present and sometimes absent, which is what is commonly called a wave-like life. I say: Your initial experience is not true, which is exactly that your faith is not true. You need to investigate it from faith, and you don't need to investigate it from joy.</p>
<p>Joy: Since it is the beginning of a Christian, and not a mysterious principle, then, can the world have someone who understands it? I say: Yes. Confucius and Yan Hui understand it, and all of Confucius and Yan Hui's disciples understand it, so it can be called true joy. I give an example: When Confucius's disciples once talked about their aspirations, they mentioned a passage about a wind-like dance of joy, and Confucius praised it loudly, admiring them to the point of worshipping the ground. This is that kind of joy. This kind of joy is the unity of Heaven (God) and man. The ancient and modern sages and philosophers all understand it. Although they understand it, the path to joy is quite difficult to find, so the world has no way to seek it. The reason is that Heaven (God) and man are too far apart, and man has no way to communicate with Heaven. Only Christ is both man and God, and is the mediator between God and man. Man can communicate with God through Christ. When God and man communicate, it is the unity of Heaven and man. The truth and greatness of joy is no more than this.</p>

<p>France has annexed several provinces of Annam, and is now coveting Burma. Because Burma and Annam are adjacent and intertwined, it is inevitable that France will use its whale-like swallowing. The former envoy to France returned to his country, and when he returned to his post, the French court specially ordered him to go to Burma along the way. This must be hiding malicious intentions, and they will take the opportunity to start a war, divide and occupy territory, and dominate. One of the envoy's entourage had a great argument, and his outstanding opinions were published in the French-language newspaper. Tracing back, Burma is a descendant of Korea, and has always been a protective screen for China. It paid tribute and called itself a subject, and has been devoted to the Emperor for hundreds of years without communicating with France. Recently, it sent an envoy to Europe, and was able to interact with France. However, the Prince of Burma has insufficient knowledge and foolish behavior, and has failed to manage the country well, so foreign troubles have taken advantage. Previously, it angered Britain, and the war led to the cession of southern Burma. The King of Burma was ashamed of this and repeatedly tried to recover it. In 1857, he sent a Westerner named Lu Zhidun as an envoy to Europe. He thought he had obtained the title of General of Ten Villages of Burma, and then showed off. He really didn't know how Westerners managed to gain favor with the King of Burma. After receiving the King's order to be an envoy to Paris, the capital of France, Lu Zhidun arrogantly called himself an imperial envoy, and wanted France to treat him with the etiquette of an imperial envoy. The French court did not regard him as an envoy, so it did not treat him with courtesy, but only allowed him to request the elite military equipment and workers of France to go to his country to work, because the King of Burma wanted to build an armory in his country. In 1871, the Italian navy was ordered to sail warships to Burma, wanting to knock on the door and ask for an audience, and sign a treaty to trade. Then the King of Burma specially sent another envoy to France, Italy, and Britain. The envoy knew the languages and writing of Britain and France quite well, and there was another Englishman who was proficient in Burmese to assist him, but the three countries did not treat him with the etiquette of an envoy. However, France sent an envoy to Burma as a reply, and the gifts he brought were quite brilliant and dazzling.</p>

<p>Ice Cream is a Fattening Agent - Actresses Abstain - Called Back to Film During Vacation - Complaints Abound</p>
<p>The summer monsoon has blown the heat wave into Hollywood, filling the movie city with the atmosphere of high summer. The actresses are all wearing new summer outfits, exposing as much of their sensual beauty as possible, and putting on sunglasses to block the strong sunlight. Outdoor refreshment stands have also opened for business, selling ice cream, various fruit juices, and mint preparations, and business is booming. But at the same time, a miracle has been discovered. This miracle is the unanimous report from the refreshment stand owners: They say that among their goods, ice cream is the least popular among the actresses, because ice cream contains nutritious ingredients such as cream and egg yolks, which cause weight gain (although a little bit wouldn't matter). "Weight gain" is the nemesis of graceful figures, so it's no wonder they regard it as something to abstain from and give up eating.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is worth mentioning... In this season of "summer, just right for having fun," outdoor sports such as tennis and swimming are very popular among the movie stars. Some movie stars take advantage of the holiday season to temporarily escape the bustling city and go to the nearby countryside for a rest, living a quiet life. However, even during the holidays, film company authorities will call them back to film at any time, which is really a disappointing thing. Therefore, complaints are inevitable. Beit Heeler is one of them. After he just co-starred with Marie Wilson in a comedy with a football game as the background (Lighthorse Harry) (Warner's new film), he wanted to forget everything and return to his villa for a vacation. Unexpectedly, a few days later, he received a summons from the company, calling him back to work immediately. He said dejectedly that next time he would learn Errol Flynn's trick of sailing a sailboat abroad, so that he could wander around and the company would have no way to urge him.</p>

<p>— Wang Yin</p>
<p>But the winds and clouds of the Northeast rose, stirring up a kind of angry tide throughout the country. Films of gods, monsters, martial arts, and chivalry were immediately regarded as poisonous things, and suffered serious criticism from public opinion. My mind became clear because of the invisible condemnation. In fact, I was not allowed to continue acting in this kind of film that anesthetized the audience's nerves, so I began to be cautious. I would only accept film topics that did not violate the times. But unfortunately, the "January 28th" incident followed one after another, and the fragile Chinese film industry could not withstand the destruction and was completely paralyzed, which made me hesitate for a while. However, this was tantamount to giving the chaotic film industry a head-on blow. After the film industry gradually recovered, the productions of various companies had mostly changed their style, and I also got the opportunity to serve the film again. I joined Yihua Film Company, changed my name to the current one, and successively starred in "The Angry Tide of the Chinese Sea" and "Escape," and began to meet the audience with a new look. At this time, I gradually felt satisfied with my work performance.</p>
<p>Yihua was full of vitality at the beginning of its establishment, and all its productions were able to raise the eyebrows of domestic films. But unfortunately, because of external oppression and the increasingly worsening national affairs, it finally had to take a passive path. Because of the restrictions of the contract, I successively starred in several films that were close to low taste, such as "Wedding Night" and "Incarnation Girl," the content of which was in absolute opposition to "The Angry Tide of the Chinese Sea" and "Escape," and finally did not receive good reviews.</p>
<p>The sound of cannons of "August 13th" rang again! It left a deep scar on the impoverished Chinese film industry, and everything was paralyzed.</p>
<p>Later, Mr. Zhang Shanxian first restored Xinhua Film Company with the greatest perseverance, and invited me to join the Xinhua front. At first, I used the film "Miss Tomboy," produced in Hong Kong, as my first work to serve Xinhua. Although this is also a soft film, what is more satisfactory is that the essence of the film does not have any poison. However, I always hope that I will no longer appear in this type of film in the future. Until now, my wish has finally been realized. Now I am engaged in the direction of "Desperate Bandit," and at the same time, I am also serving as the leading actor. The narrative of "Desperate Bandit" is aimed at the current real society, and it tells the story of blood and tears that can be seen everywhere, the story of a young worker who sacrifices everything to save a prostitute. I am confident that this script is not too bad.</p>
<p>It's just that my ability is limited, and the director's work is the first time I have tried it, so I can't help but feel a little timid. Perhaps the "achievement" will not be as satisfactory as I want, but I still did my best to do it. Success or failure, that is just "disregarded," as another question.</p>

<p>(11) Sutane (Suzhou Tanci)</p>
<p>In inverse proportion to the fate of Shenqu Opera, Sutane has already embarked on the road of decline.</p>
<p>Sutane scripts are divided into "Front Sutane" and "Back Sutane." "Adopting a Son," "Sending a Son," "Broken Bridge," and "Combining Bowls" are "Front Sutane," while "Ma Langdang" and "Selling Olives" are "Back Sutane."</p>
<p>Front Sutane is more laborious, while Back Sutane is more casual. Under the general reason that Sutane actors "fear difficulty and are greedy for laziness," Front Sutane will tend to be lost.</p>
<p>If it doesn't cheer up again, the future of Sutane is very bleak!</p>

<h3 id="e135">The Responsibility of Journalists <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The weather a few days ago was always so windy and rainy, which was very depressing. I went to the Golden Theater to listen to Yan Jupeng's "White Emperor City," but I didn't expect my depression to increase, and I even got sick. I was sick for three days, feeling bored and helpless. I casually dragged out a copy of Su Dongpo's Memorials, and there was a passage in it that I felt was somewhat related to our press circles, so I wrote it down below:</p>
<p>Since the Jianlong era, no one has ever been convicted for a word (excerpt) When words touched upon the imperial carriage, the emperor changed his expression. When matters were heard in the court, the prime minister awaited punishment. Therefore, in the era of Emperor Renzong, those who criticized the prime minister only followed the tenor of the censorate. The deep meaning of the sage, how could the vulgar people know it? The censors are certainly not all virtuous, and what they say is not necessarily all correct, but it is necessary to cultivate their sharpness and cherish their heavy power. Is it only for nothing?</p>
<p>The censors mentioned above undoubtedly represent the mouthpiece of public opinion. Are they not somewhat similar to the current journalists? When we read the above record, we can imagine that the speech of that era can be regarded as extremely free. When I was resting in Yushan (one or two years before August 13th), I also wrote several articles discussing politics and economics. Unfortunately, some predictions have now come true. Some records of the historical facts of local corrupt officials also made me feel happy, but in the end, I burned all these manuscripts myself. I think that rather than flattering the powerful, I would rather flatter innocent girls. Rather than writing great articles that do not express my feelings, I would rather write playful articles that express my thoughts freely. These words are because an elder advised me, saying that I have a relative who used to write trendy economic and political articles a few years ago, and later became rich. Now he is already looking down on everyone. You have this skill in writing dance manuscripts, so you might as well play that game too, and you might be able to win an opportunity to become an official and get rich. But I am a fool, how can I do this kind of smart thing? Therefore, rather than trying to be clever, I would rather hide my clumsiness.</p>
<p>Dancing is only a part of the entertainment world. Compared to the entire social cause, it is even more of a drop in the ocean. However, just in terms of Shanghai, there are no less than tens of thousands of people who live here (including the families of all practitioners), and no less than tens of thousands of people who relax here. Therefore, this problem cannot be considered small. Since we are shouldering the mission of representing the mouthpiece of the people, we are of course responsible for these many people. When we write dance manuscripts, first of all, we must use good intentions to examine and criticize, and not wantonly ridicule. Secondly, we must use justice to establish our words, and clearly analyze the changing ways of earning and spending money, the scope that should be followed, and the rights and obligations that should be enjoyed. Then, we must point out the evil consequences of overstepping the boundaries. Thirdly... There are too many things to say.</p>

<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>The Meaning of the Ten-Minute Break Before the Main Show</p>
<p>According to our foolish thoughts, whenever many people gather in one place, it is always the most difficult to maintain order. Let's take teahouses, taverns, and theaters all together. Everyone spends money to have fun, hoping to satisfy their eyes, ears, mouths, and noses as much as possible, so that everyone's spirit can be expressed and happy as much as possible. Therefore, things like high-profile discussions in teahouses, shouts and calls in taverns, and applause and cheers in theaters all express a kind of chaotic and noisy situation. When the star is singing and acting on the stage in the theater, even if he doesn't sing well, as long as he doesn't stop, then the order will not be too chaotic. The only thing to be afraid of is that the stage will cool down, and you will only hear the sound of gongs and drums, and you will not see a single person. At that time, the audience will riot. In the past, Yu Sansheng (Shuyan's grandfather) and the famous Qingyi Hu Xilu co-starred in "Visiting Mother." On that day, Xilu was late due to an accident. The manager asked Old Yu to "fill in." So Sansheng actually sang sixty or seventy "I feel like" until Xilu arrived. Also, whenever a play is over and the next play cannot be connected, a clown will always fill in the gap with small plays such as "Visiting the Lantern Fair" and "Inviting a Doctor" to slow down the time. But in any case, the gongs will never be cut off midway or the stage will stop moving.</p>
<p>When I suggested changing Peiping into a cultural city, I also proposed to create a municipal theater. However, before the municipal theater is built, I drafted more than a dozen suggestions for improving the old drama, preparing to promote their implementation as soon as possible. The most important thing is because the old-style theaters in Peiping are too unsanitary, and they are built very narrowly, the seats are uncomfortable, and it is very difficult to get in and out. The most annoying thing is the vendors selling scattered food, holding a basket of things high, squeezing back and forth in front of the audience, and at the same time, the sound of selling is endless. If you want to show a disgusted look, scold him a few words, or put your left leg on your right leg and don't let him pass, then he will come even more frequently. (69)</p>
