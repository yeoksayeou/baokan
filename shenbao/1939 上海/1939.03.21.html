<p>社評</p>
<h3>美國握着最有力的武器</h3>
<p>法西斯侵略者狼奔豕突的暴行，造成了國際混亂不安的局面，但同時也促起了和平的民治國家的逐漸覺醒。自從希特勒「迅雷不及掩耳」的在三天裹面滅亡了捷克，連那鞠躬盡瘁於妥恊的張伯倫，也痛感到法西斯威脅的切迫，而有亟圖與美蘇接近共同抵抗德國的趨勢。固然，說英法的統治階級今天就會放棄其一貫的「綏靖」政策，而採取堅决反侵略的立塲，未免太早；但是和平陣綫在法西斯嚴重威脅下的日趨凝結，堅定，郤是誰也不能否認的事實。這幾天來，我們看到了東南歐諸小國「岌岌求自保」的努力，我們久看到了各國外交家在倫敦的積極活動。但同樣値得我們注意的，是反侵略態度很積極的美國，正在以沉着的勞力，推動着和平陣綫的團結與鞏固。希特勒武力侵入捷克以後，美國國務副卿威爾斯首先發表宣言，譴責德國行動的在妄非法，接着羅斯福總統也對記者表示即將提出修改中立法，「以遏阻侵略的橫流。」同時，美國政府並且宣稱，爲報復德國在歐洲所爲侵略，及其以經濟勢力侵入西半球，美政府决實行對進口德貨徵收一種「懲罰稅」。國會方面預料政府對於日本及其他達背條的之國家，亦將使用此種裁制手段。美國反侵略態度的日趨積極化，足以推進和平陣錢的發展；美國如能對法西斯國家認眞加以經濟的壓力，更足使法西斯國家膽寒魄裂，以至致於死命的。</p>
<p>美國握有着最有力的經濟武器，她確乎可以「不用戰爭的方法」，弄得侵略者無法侵略。舉個例說，據Janeway的估計，美國每年可以產鋼七千二百萬噸，而全世界各國除美國外的共同產額，不到七千六百萬噸。美國如果同所有民治國家聯合起來，這力量是否那以「敲詐起家」的法西斯集團所能比擬，只要看了上面所說的一點，就可以明白了。自從「敲詐」發展成爲一種政治的武器以來，世界貿易也受了「奧泰基」的限制。歐洲是美國最大的購買者，現在買的不是糧食和商業原料了。美國農業的日深危機，正是這個結果。現在，歐洲和亞洲最需要的是機器和軍需原料，而美國正在不斷的輸給它們，帮助着法西斯蒂，把人民變做砲灰。</p>
<p>美國現行的政策，確乎太帮助了法西斯蒂。美國前國務卿史汀生曾竭力反對。名記者傑納威氏甚至大聲疾呼認爲「侵華戰爭是我們的嬰孩!」（The　war　in　China　isour　baby。）不錯，沒有美國的供給，日本簡直無法侵略中國。日本所用的油，和銅，有百分之九十以上是美國供給的。其次，日本還從美國購進大量的機器。日本自己是不能製造機器的。她也不能從她的柏林盟兄方面得到。在一九三七年，她從德國輸入的機器，六倍於美國，但在一九三八年，德國因爲連自己用還不夠，拒絕賣給日本了，現在日本所用的機器有百分之七十五是從美國輸入的。</p>
<p>對於德國，也是如此。美國另一位記者弗根氏曾有「我們建立了納粹的空軍」一文，指出德國今日空軍的建立，原料方面幾乎全靠美國的供給。德國本國所產的石油，只能滿足它一半的用途，而且質量不好。爲了改善石油的質地，她向美國購買着最好的鍊油機。這難怪傑納威要說：「如果希特勒侵略歐洲成功，美國是要負責任的」</p>
<p>從上面簡略的叙述，可知法西斯侵略國家在經濟上對於美國倚賴的深切。沒有美國物質上的支持，侵略的機器是開不動的。美國實握有着控制侵略國家的最有力武器。</p>
<p>在目前，侵略者挑戰的形勢是愈益擴大了，美國鑒於自身所受威脅的嚴重，是日益積極地號召着全世界和平勢力作反侵略的鬥爭，這固然可喜，但是還不夠的。我們希望賢明的羅斯福總統，能夠領導他的人民，更進一步的拿出最有力的經濟武器來，聯合英法蘇等各民治國，共同給法西斯侵略者以致命的打擊。</p>
<h3>美參院今日討論　中立法修正案　輿論一致當可通過並將經濟制裁日本</h3>

<h3>蘇俄不承認　德併捷克　列舉六項理由</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）德國駐蘇大使蘇倫德十六日奉其政府命令、通知蘇聯政府、稱德國已於十四日締結所謂恊定、將捷克人民置於德國國家保護之下、次日該大使又以節略致達蘇聯政府、通知德國元首宣佈於波希米亞及摩拉維亞設立保護邦之命令內容、</p>
<p>蘇聯人民外交委員長李維諾夫當以下列復文、致達該大使、內稱、</p>
<p>「貴大使本月十六日及十七日之節略、內中通知德帝國兼併捷克及德國於捷克設立保護邦等情、業已收到知悉、對於上述節略、蘇聯政府爲避免造成敝政府對於捷克斯拉夫事件不聞不問之錯誤印象起見、不能默爾而息、爰將敝政府對於上述事件之眞態度表明如下、借作答覆、</p>
<p>第一、德國公佈令文首段發表、作爲其根據及理由之政治的及歷史的見解、尤其是內中述及捷克斯拉夫國家之存在爲歐洲和平不斷騷擾及威脅之來源、捷克斯拉夫因缺乏生命力以及從而必須德帝國特別保護各點、不能認爲與全世界公認的正確事實相符、以事實言之、自第一次世界大戰後、捷克斯拉夫共和國確爲內部奪靜及眞正實行對外和平政策之少數歐洲國家之一、</p>
<p>「第二、蘇聯政府從未聞知任何國家之憲法中、有授權該國元首不得人民同意、宣佈取消該國獨立之條文、至謂任何民族竟自願取消獨立、并入他國、則實難置信、尤其是關於過去曾爲獨立奮鬥數百年、最近並已獨立二十年之民族、更絕無此理、準此、捷克斯拉夫國總統本月十五日之簽定柏林條約、自未受到該國人民之批准、從而顯然違背捷克斯拉夫國憲法第六十四及六十五兩條、因此、上述條約不能認爲法律上有效、</p>
<p>「第三、德國政府所時常引用之民族自决原則、包含人民意志之自由表現、此種表現不能以一二人之簽字代替、無論其地位如何高、此次事件中捷克人民絕無意志之表現、甚至如决定西里西亞及薩文區之公民投票形式亦無、</p>
<p>「第四、捷克人民旣無任何意志表現、德國軍隊之佔領捷克及以後德政府之行動當祇有認爲係武斷、暴力及侵略的行動、</p>
<p>「第五、關於嗣後斯洛伐克之改變國體、附庸於德帝國一事、斯洛伐克人民旣亦無任何意志表現、上述評語亦當全部適用、</p>
<p>「第六、德國政府之舉動、亦爲匈牙利軍隊橫蠻侵入卡巴琪亞羅塞尼亞、違犯其人民之基本權利之信號、</p>
<p>「第七、根據上述理由、蘇聯政府不能承認捷克以及斯洛伐克之以任何形式併入德帝國爲合法、爲與一般接受之國際公法及公理標準、或民族自决原則相符、</p>
<p>「第八、蘇聯政府之意見、以德國政府之行動不但不能消弭任何對於普遍和平之危害、正相反、業已造成及加重此種危害、破壞中歐之政治穩定、增加前在歐洲業已造成之惶慮、以及再度打擊各人民之安全情感、「上述各節、謹希轉達貴政府爲荷」、（十九日塔斯）</p>

<h3>歐洲局勢不安　日又圖謀租界　日報竟妄稱租界存在不合法僞「維新政府」組織反英同盟</h3>
<p>外息、日方鑒於歐局之嚴重、現又提出取消上海公共租界之要求、並主張將公共租界視同其他之日佔領區域、按去秋歐局嚴重時、日方曾提出此項要求、後以慕尼黑條約簽字、卽暫告擱置、今又復提出此同樣要求云、昨晨日本報紙盛稱公共租界之存在爲不合法云、</p>
<p>僞「維新政府」近在南京進行組織一所謂「反英同盟會、」該會之組織、係鼓動大小漢奸及淪陷區人民「反英運動」、僞「維新政府」此種公然反英運動、背後自有牽綫者在、由於自八一三滬戰以來、英國朝野人土、均對我國抗戰、寄莫大同情、近且貸中政府以大批借款、致遭僞方妒忌、僞「政府」一面已發通告、令淪陷區各僞「組織」速即派代表來京參加「反英同盟會」會議、該僞「政府」之通令內並指出英國會在上海造成五卅慘案、租借上海租界、包庇上海外國會審公堂、把持中國海關政權、用鴉片輸入中國、禍害同胞爲措詞、並有告「江蘇父老姊弟書」一文、嗾使江蘇僞「組織」分發各團體、</p>

<h3>「華中公司」　統制蠶種</h3>
<p>舊歷淸明、轉瞬將屆、育蠶時節、卽在目前、淪陷各縣製種塲、盡被日僞攘奪、歸華中公司統制、其數如下、蘇州滸墅關益友·豫農·中興·涇濱·四家、洞庭東山石喬·紂興·華雲·三家、錢萬里橋裕農·三五館·光福鎭永益四家、無錫寨門鎮·永泰·錢橋·天一·新安鎭永言·張涇橋·濟農·錫山·保康·國華·後暘坊前大有舜耕·求生·張涇鎭大生·梅村光明·西水關黃石橋天豐·豐年·高車渡光明第二塲·雪堰橋求新·北西漳尤家埭胡氏初中·培生館·堰橋壬戊館·村前翼農·嚴家橋大有·安鎭大遠·周涇巷新華·旺莊合興·蕩頭鎭大有·吳塘門玉峯·葑莊河東、共二十七家、宜興和橋大援天·芳橋三樂·利農·二家、常州河東鎭朋溪·漕橋振華·二家、江陰鳳戈莊天豐·馬鎮新孚·二家、以上蘇錫常宜澄五縣、共計製種塲四十四家、責令製成春蠶種八十三萬餘張、强迫農民採購、</p>
<h3>日僞在浦東厲行　麻醉政策　滬西土行賭窟均擬前往活動</h3>
<p>浦東楊思·塘橋·洋涇·陸行·高行·五區、一年來所施行之麻醉政策、日僞方面、已收初步成效、直接受麻醉影響而產生之盜賊流氓癟三、亦平添無數、茲聞又圖擴大範圍、以增收入、故未來之浦東、將變成烏烟瘴氣、等於滬西第二、茲紀各情如次、</p>
<p>烟沿浦邊各處烟館、所有烟土來源、除有人秘密運送者外、如向滬西土行購買、距離過遠、感覺不便、故將效法滬西、開設土行、俟條件談妥、下月間將行實現、屆時南市方面之烟窟、亦可向浦東購土、目下住居浦東之人、吸上鴉片癮者、約估十分之二三、且以僞員居多、</p>
<p>毒</p>
<p>自烟土價格飛漲後、浦東一部份癮君子、無力購吸者、均改吸白麵與海洛英、各里衖中、均有毒館開設、公然營業、即弄堂之中、亦可撞見、席地而坐、吸毒過癮、鳩形鵠面、到處皆是、總計吸毒之人、約佔十分之三四、僞「警」吸者尤多、購毒較購土更便、因每一市鎭、均有毒窟數處、公開營業、</p>
<p>賭</p>
<p>去歲東昌路永利公司大賭窟倒閉後、繼之有一般流氓、在東昌路後街、開設花會大筒一處、每日開筒三次、誘人入彀、各里弄並分設聽筒航船、分頭活動、無孔不入、一般無知男女、趨之若驚、而滬西各大賭窟、現因種種關係、傳將被迫停業、除擬遷往虹口者外、有數家賭窟主人、現向浦東活動、擬將各窟由滬西遷至浦東、此事巳在秘密進行、故浦東不久、將造成第二滬西云、</p>
<h3>日艦再度砲轟後　鎭海安謐如常　駐軍曾予猛烈回擊海門被炸損害甚輕滬甬綫各輪仍開航</h3>

<p>沿海各地戒備甚嚴</p>
<p>寗波溫台兩防守司令、均已奉劉總司令命令、浙東沿海嚴密戒備、防止日軍偷渡登陸、所以甬江·椒江·甌江·之戒備甚嚴、夜間禁止船隻航行、檢查旅客貨物等、船隻出入、必須事前核准、必要時决將各江完全封鎖、一切封鎖物均已準備就緒、沿江並築有鞏固之防禦工程、調有重兵駐紮、如日軍進犯、决予痛擊、</p>

<h3>「搬運證」卽可解决　食米照常運滬　荳米場嚴格執行限價</h3>
<p>甫經穩定之米市、日來因搬運證發生問題、又告上漲、豆米市塲嚴格維持限價、米糧評價會積極調查存米、訂購洋米始開、接治、民食决無恐慌、茲誌詳情如次、</p>
<p>搬運證費卽可解决</p>
<p>滬市米商、經公會于再勸告遵守限價、疏通來源後、一面在市塲盡量供給外、一面派員赴產地收購、詎料產地所謂搬運證者、連同各種雜費在內、每石原須五角左右、日來見米商大量收購、乃將該項搬運證費、每石增爲一元、米商因負担增加、成本加重、當暫停裝運、昨據米業中人云、該項問題、刻正在疏通中、不致成僵局、最近可望解决、</p>
<p>產地來貨不致斷絕</p>
<p>因搬運證發生問題、致一部份米商乘機興風作浪、放出各種無稽空氣、而使穩定不久之市塲、又告上漲、但日來由內地到滬米船、仍陸續不絕、僅數量方面、稍見减少而已、一般預料搬運證問題解决後、堆存產區之大量食米、即可源源運滬、照目下情形而論、產地來源、不致斷絕、</p>
<p>市場嚴格執行限價</p>
<p>豆米業市塲、爲防止操縱、規定辦法、取締自由買賣外、並嚴格執行米糧評價委員會「高白粳十四元、中次照別」、之限價、故日來米市塲價格、雖告上漲、但均在十四元限價以內、雖市上少數米號、不免將次貨充高貨出售、但居民如發現有售價超出十四元者、可報告當局、予以制裁、</p>
<p>積極調查全市存米</p>
<p>米糧評價委員會爲明瞭本市米糧行銷確數、作爲評價參考後、當即派金君從事調查兩租界存米、據新新社記者探悉、該項調查、刻正在積極進行中、第一步調查兩租界所有大小米棧工作、巳告完竣、第二步發送表格、請各棧塡寫存米數目工作、亦告開始、如有故意少報存米數量者、即屬存意操縱民食、社會當予制裁、故滬市存米確數、不久當可完全明瞭、</p>

<p>法文北平政聞報載、此間「臨時政府」前會發「令」自三月十一日起、在華北境內禁止法幣之使用、但此「令」顯已無效、而用變相之方式而撤回之矣、此方式維何、藎即規定「匪區」之內、尙可通用法幣、而其所謂之「匪區」者、即中國軍勢力所在之游擊區也、按游擊區之存在、素來已久、此次不過由日僞兩方加以正式承認而已、不過除其所謂之「匪區」外、日僞軍所可轄之地盤、亦復小得堪憐、則以凡爲城郊以外各農民均皆拒用僞鈔、而游擊隊亦遇有人民之持有僞幣者、一律以漢奸治罪、以此僞鈔之流通地方、爲之益狹、在當初時、「臨時政府」對於推行僞幣問題、頗費苦心、今乃以「匪區」之名辭而放棄其推行之計劃矣、然而、此間日僞方面、對於法幣之破壞、尙復不遺餘力、據稱在「六個月以內」、即可使法幣趨於崩潰、但在實際上、則「聯銀」僞鈔之推行、已歷多月、而法幣在華北之勢力、固仍然也、反之、則僞鈔之推行、已無法侵入游擊區也、此又固由華北傀儡「政權」自行承認之矣</p>

<h3>政府撥五百萬　發展蔗糖　聘專家指導種蔗令機製糖廠內遷</h3>
<p>經濟部爲發展糖業、已聘請美國糖業專家來華、指導種蔗改進技術、並撥款五百萬元爲發展之用、命令粵省機製糖廠設法內遷、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>令飭機製糖廠內遷</p>
<p>糖爲日常飲食之品、其功用與鹽等、外糖每年進口、爲數甚鉅、如去年進口價値一千九百七十九萬五千元、自粵省機製糖廠成立後、國糖品質優良、暢銷全國、洋糖進口、已自八千餘萬元、降至二千萬元、粵省糖廠、爲市頭·新造·揭陽·順德·東莞·平潭等六所、惟戰後遭日機之轟炸、被迫完全停工、今經濟部已令該省政府設法將省立之糖廠內遷、至安全地帶開工生產、</p>
<p>政府撥款發展糖業</p>
<p>西南諸省士地肥美、氣候溫和、宜植蔗糖、政府爲發展蔗糖業起見、由部撥款國幣五百萬元、用於發展糖業、除在內地設立製糖廠外、並獎勵蔗農土法製搪、期於五年之內、產量可以倍增、除供國內所需外、尙有餘量運銷海外、現已資聘美國夏威夷之糖業專家、來華担任指導農民種蔗、改進技術及提高生產量、因我國農民勤於種植、工資又低廉、將來定可獲得美滿之成績、</p>
<p>外糖乘機輸入傾銷</p>
<p>粵省機製廠糖品質優良、與舶來品無異、上海向爲唯一之重要銷地、戰後遭日機轟炸、被迫停工、致國產糖廠、運滬幾絕、外糖乘機傾銷滬市、去年十二月底截止、上海之存糖、嗬囒粗砂六萬一千八百包、嗬囒赤砂四萬零六百十七包、太古車糖五萬二千三百七十包、國產雜糖十一萬五千五百六十包、總共存糖二十七萬九千八百四十七包、較前年底增加四萬二千零十三包、</p>

<h3>海格路血案　陳庭笙遭暗殺</h3>
<p>連砍十餘刀並開放一槍</p>
<p>傷重斃命已獲一嫌疑犯</p>
<p>著名馬立司白相人陳庭笙、即陳小三子、今年三十六歲、鎮江人、素居馬立司、家有妻妾各一、妻王桂珍、今年三十四歲、係滬西法華僞「維持會長」王新大之胞妹、妾曹氏、名阿六、今年祗十六歲、新近納娶、但王曹兩氏均係姘識、未經過正式結婚儀式、而滬西戈登路上某商華康紙版廠內工人、大都拜陳</p>
<p>爲老頭子</p>
<p>前年戰事發生後、陳偕妻妾遷住於海格路海格里三十九號二房東胡海根家之二層統樓與亭子間、以接近法華王新大家、有照應故也、王氏桂珍、住統樓、曹氏阿六、住亭子間內、陳間夜與妻妾伴宿、前晚陳與王氏伴宿於統樓房間內、至昨晨七時、二房東胡海根家所僱之女傭在後門外</p>
<p>倒洗便桶</p>
<p>突有暴徒四人到來、各出手槍利刃、恐嚇該女傭、不許聲張、女傭因被嚇退入屋內後、四暴徒中之一、在後門口把風、三人即衝至樓上、擁入陳之房內、時陳正與王氏睡在床上、聞樓梯上腳步聲驚醒、意欲起床查詢、奈暴徒已至窗前、取出手槍、先對陳之胸前</p>
<p>開放一槍</p>
<p>彈中左胸、未貫穿、繼被用利刃猛砍陳之右頭角右頸項等七八刀、時陳尚伸兩手攔阻、致兩手亦各被砍中一刀、鮮血直流、暴徒見目的已達、即揚長下樓而去、當陳被開槍擊中刀砍之際、其妻王氏呆若木雞、不敢聲張、迨暴徒去後、驚魂始得鎭定、時陳受創已重</p>

<h3>婚後男子健康問題的檢討</h3>
<p>人生何所求，無病即神仙！</p>
<p>婚後體衰弱，苦中最悲慘！</p>
<p>因爲有着許多的同學，朋友，以及親戚，鄰居，他們在年輕時，我們曾一同遊戲，玩耍，他們的身體都覺得還好，可是一待婚後，曾幾何時，多數已呈衰邁狀態，不特志氣消沉，不復有往年那麼的進取，並且有幾個人竟因多病而致死亡。老友凋零，果使我可悲！因爲我是研究醫學的，更引起了我對於婚後男子健康這一問題檢討的動機。</p>
<p>結婚生活究意有否影響於健康？這一問題的解答，可謂「言人人殊」。但歸納起來，不外乎正反兩面。有人說：結婚時有損於健康的，一個男子如果不結婚，永遠地保持着他的童貞，可以享永壽。然而反駁他的人說：事實上只有看見遲婚男子的壽命每比已婚男子來得短。雖然獨身的和尚或許可享永壽，但事實上一個成年男子能夠不結婚嗎？因此，就有一般人說：結婚時有助於健康的，因為男女兩性是天賦的本能，與生俱來及時而表現其作用。這種作用如果過於把他壓抑，在生理上反會發生障礙。遲婚男子最普遍的現象，常有歇斯梯里，神經衰弱等症，據醫學家（Jamst）詹姆斯脫氏說：『過了二十八歲的男子還不結婚的話，多少總有點神經病。』初時我們不相信，後來細細的觀察事實之後，乃知言之不虛。我們更在生物學上的研究，知道有種動物因得不到配偶，且致死亡。所以結婚實是我們一個人生所不可避免的必要事情。男子只要在婚前清心寡慾，保守着童貞，婚後在夫婦生活上能守衛生之道，則伉儷間的愛情，可以天長地久，永遠的度着他們甜蜜的生活，生育着伶俐的子女，組織着快樂的家庭，如此，不特可以增進他們的健康，更充實了他們人生的幸福。鎭所謂「多福多壽多男子」。可是一個青年如果犯有自瀆遺精，或婚後的荒淫縱慾，則必爆發着滑精漏精，早洩陽萎，精力渙散，神經衰弱等症，這樣，不但多病折壽，促短了他們的天年，就是在夫婦生活上，亦必不能協調，每爲妻痛恨，演出家庭間之種種悲慘！弄到這個地步，那問題就更嚴重而複雜了。唯一補救辦法，據世界名醫及余經騐，均以服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」，最爲對症而特效。因此劑係由雄壯動物體中提取的生殖素用科學方法複製而成，所以品質純粹，藥性王道，補力積極，實爲其他腺素製劑所不及。服後於一日夜間即能生精補腎，健腦活血，滋養神經，若能繼續服用，持之以恒，則必可於短期內將上述各症完全治愈，惟有遺精者須兼服「希米脫氏周精片」，以固精關，制止遺洩，則收效尤速！</p>
<p>健美</p>
<h3>乳峯在女性健美上的價值</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>不是說一句長他人志氣，滅自己威風的話，西洋女子，的確要比我們中國女性健美得多，不但他們在少女時代，個個胸脯挺直，雙乳高聳，臀部肥大，走在路上，自有一種雄赳赳，氣昂昂的氣槪，便是幾位年老婦女，頭髮雖然白了，他們胸口的一對乳峯，還是那麼地高聳看，並沒萎癟下去，所以他們生下來的子女，也特別的聰明而伶俐，國民的體格也特別的強。</p>
<p>據世界著名美容專家兼生理學家康德林，與婦科專家湯潑生等的研究結果，認爲女性的乳峯，能夠愈高而愈有彈性，不僅在美德方面，可以和臀部腰身，構成最神秘的曲綫。使每個男子看了，發生一種良好的感覺之外，同時因着自身卵巢機能的健全，新陳代謝作用的旺盛，性情無不曠達柔順，肌肉無不晶瑩潔白，思想更無不靈敏而周密，雖遇難題當前，都能夠條分縷析的處理之，不至於感得應付困難，此外，更因血液循環的充暢，在面部便泛起了桃花迎人一般的笑靨，雖然脂粉不施，也是豔麗非常，年齡雖增，而青春常駐，兩性生活，更是無限甜蜜，組織着快樂而美滿的家庭，生育着健壯而活潑的子女，這樣的女性，她們對於國，對於家的功績，鎭是多麼大啊！可是過去如因束胸，自瀆，月經不調，白帶不感諸症，以致乳峯萎癟，臀部瘦削，健美喪失者，則不但在處女時，已是多病多痛，毫無美感動人的姿態，而且一旦　嫁而後，亦因性感淡薄及上述種種缺陷，而爲丈夫增惡，甚至遺棄不顧呢！唯一補救辦法，即服用卵巢製劑女用「生殖素」以培補精血，使卵巢機能臻於健全，新陳代謝作用亦因以旺盛，則上述各症不特可以完全根治，並可使乳峯高聳，面頰紅潤，增進健美。</p>
<h3>遺精與自凟是青年的惡魔</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>這也許是社會的畸形病態吧！當這節約救國的非常時期，在這孤島上仍然燈紅酒綠，佈滿着色情淫蕩的羅網，一般剛在發育的青年，處在這富有誘惑性的環境裏，何況他的心也正在憧憬着兩性間一切的秘密，預備去怎樣試探一個究竟。可是他們一方面因爲困於經濟及花柳病的可怖，不敢公然去宿娼，但一方面又掙脫不了桃色的迷惑，於是不得已而求其次，便開始犯上自瀆。</p>
<p>一個青年犯有自瀆之後，即使他平日的思想是如何豐富，記憶力是如何強大，體力是如何結實，但到了這個時期便不知不覺的退化下來，如果因自瀆放縱而連帶患有遺精滑精以及漏精症，此時，不特使你的發育機能停滯下來，成爲發育不全，面黃肌瘦，未老先衰，那鎭所謂是「小老人」！這種「小老人」學問與事業爲因腦力與體力之不濟，弄得一事無成。並且因為腎虧無能，精力渙散的原故，還要破壞他日後夫婦生活中的幸福！然而他的妻子，怎能長此蹉跎青春，因此演出家庭間之種種悲劇者，亦是常事！</p>
<p>關於治療遺精的方法，在今日市上雖有多種的宣傳。但最特效者，據世界名醫及余多年試騐，均以服「希米脫氏固精片」爲最。因此劑不特可以鞏固精關，且可鎭靜神經，使青年之神經衰弱者，得到安眠。是以夢境減少，心緒煩亂全無，遺精乃得以根治，惟因遺精已引起上述症象者，須兼服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」，以培補腦腎，增益精血，滋養神經，若能繼續服用，必可於短期內完全恢復健康。</p>

<h3>淋毒性的橫痃</h3>
<p>淋毒性橫痃，在淋病上比較的少見，但一般經騐不深之醫家，往往認爲此乃混有其他細菌而發生，或者，竟認爲另外一種橫痃，與淋病無關，此實是大大的錯誤。非要精明醫家，行敏捷的診斷，正確的療法不可。淋毒性橫痃，其化膿的機會，較一般的爲少，但假如誤行診斷，或者竟貿然同其他的橫痃一樣去把他開刀，那更容易變壞症。固然淋毒性橫痃也有化膿的時候，當然亦有開刀的。但已不是治療淋毒性橫痃的上策了。最上策的療法，就是迅速把淋毒性橫痃未化膿時加以治愈。實最相宜，並可減去病家無限痛苦。</p>
<p>原來淋毒性橫痃，淋菌與淋巴腺細胞淋巴球鬭爭中之一種反應的結果，所以在治療上仍然不可忽視淋菌猖獗之奔突，而善爲處置，患者兩側鼠蹊線脹大作痛，時或有發熱憎寒現象，治療之法，可用冷濕布冷罨腫脹之淋巴腺，或涂布消炎藥，及靜脈注射，使其消散，如萬一已化膿，則速行開刀，在外科上言之，開口以愈大愈佳，使所有膿液一齊排除，切忌用針開一小孔，使濃汁涓滴不已，反而有成爲　管之危險，而其匿藏攝護線，前後尿道等處之淋菌，依然要用德國濾淋不流電療法，及攝護線按摩法，將此橫痃之禍根，一齊拔去，則一般病家所驚慄的淋毒性橫痃，可以完全根本解決。不過此等病患，往往被無經騐，無學識之醫家所誤治，如前月有一錢姓病家，患此症被他醫誤治，乞余治療而獲愈云。</p>

<h3>肺癆之最近趨勢</h3>
<p>— 丁惠康</p>
<p>吾人欲防遏一種疾病之發生，不但對於其原因方面須加研究，即該病消長之狀况，變遷之歷史，人文地理之關係，亦須注意及之。在歐洲各國之工業區中，因其衛生設施之逐漸改良，故肺癆死亡率，亦已逐漸减少。在德國每萬居民中之死亡數，巳由十二率遞减至七·五率，其原因乃由於公共保險組織，及公共衛生進展之所至。在再近之一世紀中，挪威保特肺癆死亡率之最低數，在一九一〇年，則以丹麥爲再低，在一九二〇年，則以荷蘭之死亡率，較之挪威尤低，在戰後，則瑞士·英國·瑞典·及德國之統計，其死亡率均行减低。</p>
<p>以最近之觀察，則德國較之其他各國之肺癆死亡率，更爲遞减，爲全歐及全球肺癆死亡率最少之國家。加拿大之肺癆統計，非常增高，其死亡率較之其他民族，多出七倍有半。英屬之澳洲，肺癆傳染之年齡甚遲，印度之肺癆情形，比較惡劣，其死亡率非常之高，每年每萬人民中，的有三十率之死亡者。在意大利因城市間居民之稠密，缺少廣塲庭園，工作室大多過於狹小，均有肺癆傳佈之大原因。如北歐諸國及荷蘭，每年人民之死亡數，不及全國病院之床數，在英美德諸國，則死亡數及病床數幾相同，在法國則每一個病床數有二個之死亡數，其死亡數，在意大利則每個病床數有五個之死亡數，其死亡數自一九二五年，始行减少，直至一九三〇年爲止，肺癆之統計，已减少百分之三十二。意國實施防癆工作者，爲法西斯主義政府，實施結核强迫保險，成績極佳。法國之肺癆死亡率，比較的亦甚高，現時「防癆診療網」之組織，雖已非常完善，然其成績尙不能十分滿意。以普通而論，肺癆死亡率，在歐洲各國問，法國常爲最高之保持者。比利時之死亡率，情形甚爲安全，在瑞士之肺癆死亡率，較其死亡總數，並不十分减少，卽較之歐洲其他各國，如奧國·匈牙利·愛爾蘭·芬蘭·諸國，其死亡率亦高，死亡年齡，大多爲幼童時代。南歐諸國，如羅馬尼亞及希臘二國之肺癆，死亡率均高，匈牙利氣候惡劣，房屋之構造甚爲困難，故肺癆之在該國，可稱爲居住病。在北歐之肺癆死亡率，較爲安全，如丹麥·挪威·瑞典·等國均是。挪威之肺癆死亡率，亦已减少，在一九二九年，每萬居民中有十五·六之死亡率，以文明各國之比較率以觀，則列入第十一位。在丹麥之肺癆死亡率，甚爲安全，城市間爲每萬人中，有六·三率，全　爲七·五率之死亡數，爲全世界最低之給核死亡例。俄國全境之統計甚不一致，現時俄羅斯民族之肺癆死亡率，較之蘇維埃聯邦內其他民族爲高，在西伯利亞之東部則較爲减少，北美洲之肺癆統計，其死亡率之高峯，與居住之密度極有關係。在本世紀之初，美國以肺癆死亡率占全死亡數之第一位，但至今日，已退至第六位矣。密西根洲較之南部之南部諸洲更爲减少，克利佛蘭州，在一九三〇年每萬居民中，僅有八·三死亡率，此種死亡率减少之程度，非有色人種所能及，在墨西哥肺癆之死亡率，近年來亦巳减少，南美阿根廷及巴西之肺癆死亡率，近年來亦已减少，南美阿根廷及巴西之肺癆死亡率，因公共衛生之不良，死亡率甚高。又菲列賓肺癆情形，在一九三〇年每萬居民中，爲三〇五五死亡率。在日本及中國，與以上諸境，不無相同之點，但須注意者，在每個境內之死亡率均不相同，中國之北部及西部，患肺癆者較少，中部及南部，則肺癆之傳染較多。在最近百年內，大多數之黑人，均向美洲移居，而成爲斯克拉夕之一族，在北美合衆國之統計，爲每萬居民中，白人有七·二死亡率，有色人爲二三·三死亡率，較之白人爲多出三倍，肺癆專家稱爲種族過敏性。在美國四十五個大城市之死亡率，統計竟巳减退不少，平均爲每萬人中，有八·一三率，而芝加哥僅有六·六率，惟黑人則爲四十率，此種種族差異的原因，甚難解决，惟大眾之情形如何。當然亦有相常之關係。「鄕村」間之肺癆悄形，以國聯萬國衛生處之報告，證明最高之肺癆死亡率，在工業不發達之農業區城，但多數學者，仍以肺癆之傳染，在鄕村間平均爲較少。最堪注意者，凡由鄕村遷往城市間居住之人民，在最初之二年內，多有發生劇烈之病擊者，尤以靑年爲多數。肺癆死亡，與「年齡」之關係，以德國之統計，在三十至七十歲之開，則兩性幾乎相等，在五歲至三十歲之間，則婦女較高於男子。又以學齡兒童而論，其死亡率亦已漸行下降，所須注意者，乃女孩之新傳染，在校內較男孩爲多，同時證明肺癆之傳染，並不在幼童年齡之最初期，乃在較高之年齡，至於减少傳染之原因，由於學校設備之改進，及發現病熊後，立即爲之隔離爲最要。又以最近研究學齡兒童之傳染，均由於家庭間的傳染，其由集校間得來者，爲率甚鮮。在大規模檢查之下，大學生發現患肺癆者，有百分之一至一三，而活動性肺癆，亦有增加之傾向，職業與肺癆之關係，最易受傳染者，當然爲護士與醫師，此種特殊職葉，實較其他爲危險，其餘如有多量灰塵之吸入者，如鞋匠縫工等，傳染率亦較高。在意大利北方，發現六十歲以上之居民，有百分之肺癆息者，屬於開放性者，以德國開放性肺癆之統計，則至少以每年之死亡統計，乘以三倍之數，如以一九三二年德國之死亡率，每十萬人中爲七。五乘以三倍爲二二。五，以其全國之人口而計，則爲十四萬六千二百五十人，此類開放性肺癆患奢，其平均之生活年歲，的爲三年，實爲家屬傳染之大原因。又「夫婦」間之肺癆堪注意者，乃爲男子之患者，多傳染及於健康之妻，其原因爲婦女多有姙娠及生產之關係，或因極力看護其夫，遂致易被傳染。但夫婦間之肺癆，並不如琿想中之可懼，因結婚者其年齡大都巳過最危險之時期及感受性矣。以近年來世界之文獻及統計而觀，若英美德各國，均巳達到防癆極圓滿之結果，在每萬人中，僅有七或八人之死亡率。法國瑞士，雖於防癆亦甚努力，但尙有較高之死亡率，簡而言之，各國肺癆之傳染，尙甚劇烈，若無相當之經濟，則其防癆之成功，必尙甚難。今後吾人所急應注意者，爲「失業保險」與「疾病保險」之組織方法，乃减少肺病死亡率之最大中動力，其次則爲「X光診斷」之普及，與「壓縮療法」之改進，使人人明瞭肺癆一症，在現代醫藥擊中，並無特效藥，而長時期之服藥，反可使病機之增進，我國肺癆之蔓延，實爲迷信服藥與調理之一種悲慘結果，觀乎各國防癆之成功，舍是將莫由矣。</p>
<p>生理衛生談座</p>
<h3>關於肌和骨的生理常識與生理衛生</h3>
<p>— 范守淵</p>
<p>誰都知道，這肌和骨，是人體組織某統中最佔重要的基本組織。關於這二個人體組織的一般智識，以及如何攝護的衛生常識，也是一般人們所應當注意的。現在，我來把這二個組織系統的一般智識，分別的寫出一點，想來也是一般讀者所需要的吧。</p>
<p>先說骨。</p>
<p>骨，通常的名稱，呌做「骨頭」。人體中有許許多多的骨頭，作爲支柱人體的架子。這許多人體上的骨頭，總名稱牠爲「骨骼」。要是人體沒有這項骨頭，一切依附於骨頭上的種種柔軟組織，如皮膚啦，肌肉啦等等，便要無處安置了。在功用上，那末，不但不能行走動作，而且也不能挺立了。同時，許多靠牠庇護的器官，如腦子，脊髓等等，也便根本失去了保護的工具了。所以，人體因有骨頭，整個身體上的組織器官，才有委託之所，才能構造成一個人體。</p>
<p>骨的生理功用，方才已順筆提起過：（一）牠是支柱人體的位置，使之能挺立不倒；（二）牠能使人體運動：如走路，作事等等的動作，都非有骨做主體不辦；（三）牠是許多人體上的重要組織器官的保護器：最明顯的，如頭顱骨之保護腦子，脊椎骨之保護脊髓，眼眶骨之保護眼球等等都是。論到牠的形狀呢，則頗不一致：有一條條，而長短至不一律的棒頭，筆桿之狀的，好比上下肢骨就是；有一塊塊，大小並不相同，如木頭，石塊之形的，譬如脊椎骨，就是屬於這一類形狀的：有如扁平的瓦塊，頭顱骨上，有許多這一類形狀的骨頭頭；又有細長而彎曲如弓形的，環圍在胸背中間的肋骨即是。此外，當然還有各色各樣的形狀的，這兒也不必多述了。</p>
<p>說話轉個方向，還是回頭來說說牠的衛生吧。</p>
<p>骨的衛生，表面上，好像不大看得出，其實，亦甚爲重要。譬如對於頭顏，應如何的保護好，不可使牠受打擊，或過力的觸動。不然，頭顱受了傷，輕則損害腦經，重則喪生致命。我國過去舊式敎育的私塾敎師責罰學生，動不動就用一塊硬硬的戒方，去痛擊學生頭部，這在衛生上，是一種甚非所宜的舉動。又在睡眠時所用的枕頭，不可採用過於堅硬的質料：睡眠時光，亦不宜專偏於一面，以防頭骨變形，影響及腦子。（這個，尤其是在幼年與童年，更宜注意！）至於讀書時期的靑年，在骨的衛生上，最主要的，似乎還是在於脊柱骨的一方面。如讀書，寫字，是靑年學生的日常工作，但如在讀書寫字之時，不注意坐位　勞的正直，很易影響於脊柱骨，而漸漸地使之成彎曲的狀態。靑年學子，往往在贖書寫字之際，常常犯着斜倚式俯伏於几桌的毛病，日久成習慣，脊柱骨的形狀，不是成了駝背，就是變成彎曲。這不但有碍健康，同時，在身體的姿態上說，亦成不端正的一種病熊了。對於這點，只要靑年學子，在讀書寫作時，旭以留意，務使身體正直端座，這樣就能保持脊柱骨的正常而康健的狀態了。其次，說一說胸廓的衛生。什麼呌做「胸廓」？就是人體門前頭的胸頭合背後頭的一部份脊柱骨，兩者的四周，環圍以一根弓形的肋骨；這三者合成的一個範圍的一個名稱。對於這部份骨骼的衛生，要穿着的衣服寬舒一點，不可穿得過緊，壓迫胸廓，否則，即能妨碮胸部的發育的。中國少女，從前有束胸的習慣，歐美婦人，亦有因競尙蜂腰而犯束腰的惡習，這都一律的犯了違反胸部衛生的舉動；因爲道種舉動惡習，不但影響胸部的發育，使肋骨變形，同時還能妨碍肺部的呼吸和胃腸的消化呢。所以這一種違反衛生的惡習，不宜相五效尤，應當從速革除才是。</p>
<p>最後，足部骨頭的衛生，亦有說牠一說的必要。靑年學生，現在大多穿着皮鞋，這，本無妨於衛生；不過，皮鞋的形狀，時時變化，鞋的頭部，忽尖忽圓，這裹就有合衛生與不合衛生的出入了。因脚趾的形狀，各人不同，而一時風行的鞋形，每每一時尖者都尖，圓者都圓的風氣。其實，最好以各人的脚形定鞋的形狀，使之適足，使之舒服爲最佳。然大體上說，鞋的前端過尖者，易於壓迫足趾，而漸成弓曲的畸形之狀，斷非足部衛生之道。所以，希望愛美的靑年們，對於穿着皮鞋，切不可僅求外表的美觀，而不顧穿着時的舒適，行走時的便利；只有穿着適足的鞋，始能保護足部的健康，足部的美觀呢。</p>
<p>骨的衛生，就止於此。往下再說肌。</p>
<p>肌，就肌肉二字的簡稱。肌肉，多是依附在骨骼的外面。全身所有骨骼之處，幾乎無處沒有肌肉長在牠的外圍的。如果拿房子來作個比方，那末，骨骼好比房子的鋼管，肌肉正如依附在鋼管之外的水泥。全身的骨頭數目，據計算的結果，說有二百；全身的肌肉呢？可沒有骨頭的那麼容易計數淸楚了。因各人計算方法的不同，有的說三百，有的報五百；我們此刻來籠統」點的說牠大的德在三五百條之間吧，這，總不會有多大差錯，十分出入的。每條肌爲，都有一個起點的頭與終點的尾的；然亦有起點一個，而終點二三，與終點一處，而起點二三之不同。上頭說全身肌肉的統計數目不統一，其主因，即因爲每條肌肉的起頭終尾各不一律的緣故哩。至於牠的生理功用呢？那是複雜非凡？可以說，全身所有的動作，都脫不了牠的支配：舉物，要用着臂膀手掌上的肌肉，走路，用着腿脚上的肌肉，吃飯，要用咀嚼肌來工作，大小便，也算要肌肉的帮忙不行。餘如一哭一笑，即要起用哭笑的肌肉，一呼一吸，亦需用呼吸的肌肉。總之，全身一切的動作，都不會沒有牠的分兒哩。</p>
<p>肌肉是什麼顏色的？我相信一定會有許多人不的而同的說着：「鮮紅色的」！其實，並不然。不過，諸位所說鮮紅色的這一句話，倒亦不能說沒有個根據的；我們把附體的皮膚剝開時，不是就淸淸楚楚看見鮮紅色的東西嗎，這是什麼東西呢？沒有人會回答錯的：「這就是肌肉呀」！然而且慢。這東西，的確日肌肉無誤，而這肌肉的鮮紅色，却並非肌肉本身的顏色，而是蘊藏在肌肉之內的血液呢。如果把這鮮紅色的肌肉，浸漬在冷水盂中，不久就會落了染，脫了色，冷水成了紅色，肌肉却呈出淡靑色來了。這就如着了顏色的布片紙條之類，下了水，退了色，漸漸地就變了本初面目一樣哩。</p>
<p>疾病常識</p>
<h3>糖尿病與多尿病（下）</h3>
<p>— 周振禹</p>
<p>多尿病之起因</p>
<p>多尿病者，乃一慢性病症，呈現口渴多尿之病徵，此雖與糖尿病徵近似，但其口渴之甚，尿量之多，均超勝於糖尿病者，且其尿內，無糖質之存在。其起因旣與飲食無關，故其尿量雖多，然其尿內所含之排泄物質，以一日計算，與常人無甚差異，惟其水量增加，水量之增，乃由多飲而起也。</p>
<p>此病之根，乃係腦垂腺受病而起。腦垂腺者，亦爲內分泌腺體之一，分爲三部。曰前部，曰中部，日後部。其分泌之物質，三部各呈不同之功用，前部與人體長育有密切之關係，多則身體長大，少則身體短小，中部後部之內分泌，與長育雖無甚關係，有收縮平滑肌之能力，設若注射其分泌液於動物體內，則血壓增高，尿量加多，且有收縮子宮之能力，故產科用之，作爲催生之劑。人體內糖之新陳代諸，雖與島素有密切之觀係，但腦垂腺之分泌亦有調節其功用之能力，故腦垂腺者，乃具有數種功用之腺體也。多尿病之起，由腦垂腺本身病者，則謂之曰先天性多尿病，其所以然。現尙未能了解，但祇知其與腦垂腺之內分泌有關耳。或由腦中生瘤，或由梅毒侵襲與腦垂腺有關之紳經，或由跌打損傷，傷害腦經或脊髓者，他如傳染病，如腦膜炎，傷寒等症，毒攻腦垂腺之神經系統者，均足以致成多尿病，由此類因素而起病者，謂之後天性多尿病也。</p>
<p>多尿病之病理</p>
<p>患有多尿病者，其腦垂腺，或該腺有關之神經，非傷則病，此由解剖之經騐而得者也。由下級動物之試騐，使腦垂腺之後部傷損，則現有多尿病。腦垂腺有關之神經，或傷或病，亦有多尿病之發現。以下級動物做試騐，注射腦垂腺液，同時將該動物腎臟神經切斷，亦發現多尿病。如將此動物之血液，輸入另一健全之動物身體內，得有傳染之多尿病，其理現尙難以瞭解也。近來莫氏，與施氏以狗做試騐，將其腦垂腺之根蒂，以銀絲緊紮，則發生多尿病，如將共盾狀腺（乃內分泌腺體之一）挖出，多尿病則止，如令食盾狀腺質，多尿病則復來。故人工性之多尿病，吾人可自由創造也。總之，多尿之爲病，腦垂腺固爲其主要因素，而盾狀腺亦屬重要之成分也。</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>全體肌肉的名稱，多得非凡，都各以牠所生的地位或昨用，定牠不同的名稱。至於袖的構造呢，倒不外乎二種：即隨意肌與不隨意肌是。這隨意肌與不隨意肌的分別在那裹？牠的分別，只要望文生義的一想，就得明白了：所謂隨意肌，即隨心所欲的運動，不隨意肌，則反之。這似乎無待我來解說，諸位都會明瞭的。</p>
<p>現在，輸說到肌爲的衛生了。因爲肌肉與運動二者，根本是不能一刻分離的牽聯着，所以，牠的衛生，亦幾乎以運動爲牠的對象了。</p>
<p>爲什麼肌肉衛生與運動，有如此一刻不能分離的密切關係呢？現在，我們就來說明一下，運動與肌肉衛生的這一個關係。</p>
<p>普通看一個人的健康與否，大都拿肌肉的發達不發達做標準。這雖非絕對的合理，然也不無有相當的理由和根據，或者可以說，是有相對的合理的。我們只要看，一個健康的人，多半，他的肌肉亦是有相當的豐富，發達；反之，肌肉柔弱，所謂「形瘦骨立」的明友，也大體不會得健康的多。然而肌肉的豐富不豐富，堅實不堅實，却往往看其人對運動的注意不注意來做標準。注意運動的人，他的肌肉多半發達而堅實；否則，卽多肌瘦肉柔。所以，要一個人的强壯健康，肌肉的豐富發達，那末，運動這一件工作，就不可或缺的了。這道理是很淺顯，很易明白的。不過，現在我們却要進一步來說一說，爲什麼運動能使肌肉發達，能造成肌肉的堅實呢？即運動之能使肌肉發達堅實的原理在那裏？</p>
<p>現在我就要來說說這一層道理。</p>
<p>讀者諸君都很曉得的吧，吾人在運動時，身體引起一種什麼現象？運動時，我們體內的血液循環一定暢旺起來，心跳增快得非凡，同時，體溫也增高了，呼吸也急促了，渾身流汗，終於到了肌疲體乏的結果。這，是一種什麼表示？這便是表示着因我們肌肉的勞動，而使全身體內的物質起了變化了。是體內的什麼物質發生變化呢？生理學家給我們實騐過，這物質就是我人體內的「澱粉體一起了分解。澱粉體有個學名呌做「含水炭素」，故同樣可以說，運動時，體內的物質變化，就是這一項「含水炭素」的分解。運動時，旣需許多體內的含水炭素的消耗，運動以後，不消說，就需要多量的含水炭素來補充，理由甚明。勞動者多健飯，以及一般運動以後的人，飲食飯量都增加起來，就是用來補充體內所消耗所損失的含水炭素呢。這，正如火爐燃料燃盡時，再須加入煤炭等燃料之後，始能重燃生暖的一般。運動時的呼吸加速，這道理也容易明白的；上頭所謂運動時所起體內的物質變化，係體內含水炭素分解而成功，而含水炭素之所以能起分解的作用，這就全　空氣中養素的功勞；換句話說：體內的含水炭素靠了這項養素的作用，才起分解的工作，才發生出體溫的然，才發生出運動時的力來呢。呼吸加速，一方而藉此把體內用過之後的廢物—炭素，排送出體外，一方面就是向外界　輸多量的養素進來，作爲分解體內含水炭素的用處。</p>
<p>就因爲這個原故，運動時所耗費的體熱與動力，是靠體內含水炭素的分解，即運動時，必須消耗體內多量的含水炭素，運動後呢，不消說，就需多量的含水炭素來補充，而攝取作爲補充之用的食物，又往往是多過其所失。在此損失多而補充更多時，肌肉的弛縮能力自然增强，肌質本身，亦同時漸漸增加，漸漸堅實起來，肌肉的動作力，亦無形中豐雄而加强了。</p>
<p>這便是運動之所以能使肌肉發達堅强的一番道理，也就是運動爲肌肉衛生的惟一方法的淺易說明。</p>
<p>因爲運動能使肌肉發達增强，所以也可以說，運動就是肌肉衛生的惟一方法。這，上頭已經說得很明白了。但，上頭所說的，也因爲僅僅只說明「運動」能使肌肉發達增强，所以肌肉衛生的方法的理由，至於怎樣的運動，才能獲得肌肉的衛生，達到肌肉增强的目的，這一層還未說到呢。</p>
<p>運動是肌肉衛生的惟一方法，誠然不錯；但要達到這一個肌肉衛生的目的，却也要有一個運動方式上的限度才行。否則，要是從事的人，在運動時，超過了「衛生」的限度，便未必能達到這個肌肉衛生的目的；有時，反會造成反乎肌肉衛生的害處呢？所謂限度—就是恰到好處的適宜程度，不可過分疲勞，亦不可過分激烈。在運動到了相當疲乏之時，便不可不顧肌肉之過勞而繼續不斷的運動下去；因肌肉在運動時感到相當疲乏的時候，即應立即停止運動，予以休息的時機，使牠恢復過來。不然，在感到有相當疲乏之時，仍持久的運動下去，勢必至於能力驟减，終於達到不堪運動，無力運動的程度。這便是過勞了。在肌肉過勞之時，一方面體內消費以後所剩下的廢物增加而蓄積，不及排出體外，一方面，體內所耗費的物質過多，不及補充，因而肌肉遂是一種雖經刺激，亦必不易引起收縮的反應之怠工現象了。此時惟一辦法，就是立即停止運動，予以休息，供以新鮮空氣，卽能恢復牠的疲勞。所以在跑路運動或長途旅行之後，如來按摩腿足，或以溫水洗足，使下腿的血行暢快，亦爲恢復疲勞的一個好法子。</p>
<p>不但運動的時間，要有限度，不可過分疲勞，不宜過激，在運動的時候，亦不可運用職子，作種種其他的思想。換言之，運動時，應專心一致的運動，不宜分心。即運動後的相常時間，馬上用腦作事，亦非所宜，而應予以萬念皆空的全部休息才是。因爲在運動時，不消說，肌肉中必流入多量的血液，如同時用腦，那末，血液豈不是又須一部份流入腦子裹去嗎？然而人身的血液，是有一定的限量的；腦子思想須血流入，肌肉中的血液便無形的减少了；這樣便會雙方受損，各各得不到好結果。運動後的相當時間，應予休息，不能用腦，亦因爲此時血流，還不能到平和的常態，多量血液，還稽留在肌肉當中。如此時卽作他事，運用腦子，如讀書思想，腦子得不到多量血液，思想一定不能統一，讀書亦必視而不見，讀不進腦子裹去的</p>
<p>最後，再來說一說對於運動的幾點注意，作爲本節的結束。</p>
<p>（一）運動應擇淸潔的地方，戶外較戶內爲優，因易於呼吸新鮮空氣之故。</p>
<p>（二）運動時，宜穿實舒之短衣褲，緊壓頸胸部的狹窄衣服，足以妨凝血流及呼吸之舒暢，極不相宜。</p>
<p>（三）從事運動，須有恒久心，每日定時行之，不加間斷；同時，尤宜順序漸進，先易後難，先輕後重，不可忽輕忽重，忽行忽止，而無準則。</p>
<p>（四）進食前後，不宜運動。身心不適，亦應暫停。</p>
<p>（五）運動不可令其過勞，且須隨各人原有的體力爲標準，切不可勉强；運動後，更須有相當休息的時間，不可立即做他項工作——無論體力工作或腦力工作，皆非所宜。</p>
<p>（六）運動之後，多飲開水，以袖充運動時所損失的水份，旣合衛生，又暢精神。</p>
<p>（七）運動方法，隨各人的職業環境而異，日常坐業而缺乏體力勞動的人，更不可不選擇一種簡便的體力運動。</p>
<p>（八）運動以後，須特別注意受冷着寒，以致感冒；因此最易爲從事運動者所疏忽；然因運動而得病，則得不償失，太不上算。</p>
<p>此外，當然還有許多應注意的事項，這裹不能細述。以上，只不過隨意寫出依得注意的幾點，作爲運動者的一點衛生警語耳。</p>

<h3>輸血淺言</h3>
<p>— 瞿紹衡</p>
<p>流氓之切口，稱錢曰「血一，有錢曰有血，錢多曰血多，故借錢曰借血，良以錢之爲用大，而無錢則諸事不能行也。語曰：「手裹無錢活死人，」信然；醫學上稱少血者曰貧血，社會上稱無錢者曰窮人，窮，即貧也，人少錢則貧，貧極而不能維持其生活者，當借錢以濟其急。人少血則病，病重而將瀕於死亡者，亦當借血以救共命。然世人多明於借錢之理，而昩於借血之義，故對於借錢奢，雖易慷慨解襄，而對於借血者，則往往滯疑難諾，不知體壯者稍去共血，是猶九牛一毛，無關其痛癢也，何吝而不爲哉？茲請略述醫學上借血之意義及共效用與方法；</p>
<p>借血，即輸血也，輸血之應用於醫學，由來久矣。然因當時缺乏血淸學知識，故反增無謂之犧牲。迨自近代血淸化學長足進步，而遂有同種血球凝集反應之　見，（Schattock,Donath,Landsteiner　Grukbaum等及至Jausky　Moss.Dungern　Hirschfeld諸氏發見人類血液有四羣之偉績，而輸血之危險，消除殆盡。更依Hustin　Weil　Ruck　Freud　Lewisohn創始枸　酸曹達加血液之間接輸血法，而輸血之操作乃更簡易矣。茲再進言其詳，</p>
<p>輸血之功能如左：</p>
<p>（一）充實已虛血管，藉使續營强心作用，以防發生震盪。</p>
<p>（二）藉赤血球之酸素運輸作用，而使增進組織呼吸。</p>
<p>（三）不特可以供給血漿中所含各種營養素，並可輸入各種內分泌液。</p>
<p>（四）又可輸入免疫素，以使增大對於傳染病之抵抗力。</p>
<p>（五）輸入血淸中所含血液凝固促進物質，而使發生止血作用。</p>
<p>（六）血液蛋白可以刺戟骨髓及其他造血機關，以使機能亢進，增生新血。</p>
<p>輸血之方法，別爲直接與間接二種：</p>
<p>（一）直接輸血法此乃以新鮮血液不加任何操作，而直接輸入病者血中之法也，論理固合理想，然實施諸多不便。</p>
<p>（二）間接輸血法血液中加以枸　酸曹達，使成非凝性後而輸入之法也，此法操作簡單，人人可以實施。故茲述簡單之實施法；</p>
<p>給血者之選擇給血者不可有癩，（麻瘋）結核，梅毒，瘧疾，以及各種傳染病，性同而年齡相若者最佳。</p>
<p>血型之斷定　不獨人類，凡脊椎動物血淸中均有溶解異種赤血球（血球溶解素）及使其凝集（血球凝集素）之性質，且往往有溶解同種動物血球，（同種血球溶解素）及使其凝集（同種血球凝集素）之作用。輸血時，給血者之赤血球，若於受血者體內發生溶解或凝集作用，則起危重之輸血微象，—Transfusionserscheinnng而甚至於死，故給血者之血球，是否可與受血者之血淸互相融合，不可不察也。血型斷定法，有用標準血淸與不用標準血二種，</p>
<p>甲　用標準血淸之法</p>
<p>人體血型，大別爲四羣，然其分類之法，則學者間互有參差。</p>
<p>Jansly　ⅠⅡⅢⅣ</p>
<p>Moss　ⅣⅡⅢⅠ</p>
<p>Dungern</p>
<p>und　O　A　B　AB</p>
<p>Hirschfeld</p>
<p>集原　O　A　B　AB</p>
<p>集　AB　B　A　O</p>
<p>J，M，之法，易起謬誤，故一般主從D，H氏法。D，H氏法以大寫拉丁字母代表赤血球凝集原，以小寫字母代表血淸凝集素，凡同種族之血液中，無同一凝集原及凝集素，故不起凝集反應，然如混以異種族之血液，則立呈凝集現象。</p>
<p>今設以A，B血淸爲標準血淸，而將未知血球與其混合時，即可斷定未知血液之血型。其法先將A，B血淸各取一滴於載物玻璃之兩端，而各加以未知之新鮮血液，然後將玻璃片前後左右動搖數次，則於五分鐘內，即可檢其有無凝集反應矣。</p>
<p>如於B血淸內發現凝集，則被檢者之血爲A型，如於A血淸內發現凝集，則被檢者之血爲B型，如於A，B血淸內皆現凝集，則被檢者之血爲AB型，如於A，B血淸內皆不凝集，則被檢者之血爲〇型，故一般給血者，以O型爲佳，而一般受血者以AB型爲佳，換言之，O型之血，即人人可得而予之，AB型之血，即人人之血可得而受之也。其關係如下；</p>
<p>乙　不用標準血淸之法</p>
<p>（一）Nurnberger氏三滴法載物玻璃片上，置一滴10％之枸　酸曹達，而再加以給血者與受血者之血液各一滴混合後，觀其有無凝集反應，陰性者同型，陽性者異型。</p>
<p>（二）Mandelstamm氏四滴法載物玻璃片上，置一滴蒸溜水，而加以受血者之血液一滴，使起溶血後，再加5％枸機酸曹達汲給血者之血液各一滴，混合後，觀其有無凝集反應。</p>
<p>給血者之採血量失血量多少，對於全身狀態之影響，依人種及體格而不同，我國人之採血量，當以五百公撮內外爲限度；故需大量輸血之際，當準備二人以上之給血者。</p>
<p>近有組織輸血供應所者，糾集給血志願者若干人，除預檢無血液傳染病外，並預斷其血型之種類，俾有需要輸血之際，即可隨時召其適合者而採用之，是猶當典質物，有無相通之義，誠不可或緩之舉也。</p>

<h3>肺炎之維生素丙療法</h3>
<p>— 孫惠英</p>
<p>以維生素試用於特異缺乏症以外之種種疾患，行之者雖已甚多，但現在纔漸漸將到達於批評之時期。著者以維生素甲，乙，丙，丁等用淤種種之疾患，而就中認爲最有效者，爲外傷性神經隙碍之10,B肺炎之也。肺炎診斷確定後，同時卽以020公絲mg.之維生素丙注射之，其後每日注射200乃至500公絲mg.注射之法，與其用大量行一回之注射，不如分數回行之爲佳。由此維生素之注射，能促進分利的及渙散性之下熱。通常治療開始時，熱卽下降，患者之自覺症狀，亦著明輕快，所有不安，食慾不振，及發紫藍色之患者，其理學的症狀雖尙未變化，而其食物及談話，則頗能呈活潑之氣象，本療法對於氣管枝性肺炎，亦能短縮其經過，在預防上，對於手術後肺炎，用之有效。此外對於血支病，膽襄炎，腎盂炎，惡阻等亦有效也。（余氏研究室抄讀會）</p>

<h3>德國此後的動向</h3>
<p>— 茂烈</p>
<p>假使德國此後不適可而止，就此洗手不幹；假使列强此後不予以嚴重的打擊，使之知難而退，則德國的慾望只有一天比一天大起來，侵略的行爲只會有加無已，到引起第二次的世界大戰，才會停止。</p>
<p>現在，奧地利併合了，捷克瓜分了，德國此後的動向是什麼呢？最顯然的，她已經向羅馬尼亞提出經濟的要求，她的目光已經注射着羅馬尼亞身上，羅馬尼亞誠有不勝其　觫之感，大家當然就要想，她就要向羅馬尼亞開刀了。</p>
<p>據英國「格林威治時報」的推測，則謂德國於最近的將來，將向法國要求戰前的殖民地以及亞爾薩斯和洛林的主權。</p>
<p>此外，當然還有別種可能的推測。</p>
<p>我不是預言家，也不是熟知國際情事的政治學家。但我對於德國此後的動向，却也有一些意見。</p>
<p>照我看，德國現在的目的，是恢復二十餘年前歐戰初起時的地位，她的初步方法，就是併吞她附近的小國。奧地利和她同種同文，歐戰前本是同盟國，她要併吞；捷克的波希米亞和摩拉維亞，本來是屬於奧利地的，她要併吞：那末，本來和奧地利成爲聯合王國的匈牙利，她自然更要併吞了。她此後最近的目的地，似乎就是匈牙利。</p>
<p>不錯，匈牙利已在去年聽從德國的要求，被限制爲農業國，她的陸軍已變爲無足輕重了，然而她究竟還是一個獨立國。德國耍有事於東方，即使是最近的羅馬尼亞，就不能不先將匈牙利完全併吞下去，消化完盡。否則匈牙利夾在她和羅馬尼亞之間，她怎能放心呢？有人說，德國聽由匈牙利去侵略捷克的喀爾巴阡烏克蘭，並非有愛於匈牙利，不過假手於匈牙利，將來取之如外府耳。這話，也可以作爲我說的旁證。</p>
<p>德國向英法有所耍求，固然是現行狀態下的必然趨勢。但她目前似乎還沒有到這個地步。她必須將附近的小國一一解决了，才會向英法發動。至於東進向俄，假使竟會有這一件事—我就不信—，一定還在她對英法的種種問題解决以後。</p>
<p>「遠交近攻」，德國是很懂得這個原則的。不過她的一交」，並非玉帛，而是恐嚇與欺騙。她此後還將遵照這個原則進行着。</p>

<h3>他</h3>
<p>— 瑩金</p>
<p>他自然也算是一個救亡靑年。</p>
<p>每天上午必唱「松花江上」二遍，但也接着唱「何日君再來」一遍。三月前就大喊「到內地去」，但也終於沒有去。</p>
<p>「沒有去」自然也有原因的：譬如母親不允許，盤費不充足，以及沒有同伴等等都是。</p>
<p>但這幾天却又如死灰復燃般的喊了起來：</p>
<p>「眞的，我一定要到內地去！在這裹住下去會把俄的意志銷磨完的！」</p>
<p>接着就對毎一個朋友說：「假如我到內地去了，你們能够帮助我一些盤費嗎？」</p>
<p>「那當然！可是你的母親已經允許你了嗎？還有，同伴有沒有？」</p>
<p>「那沒有關係！」</p>
<p>可是，一天，二天，……很决的過去了，他依舊還住在這裏。</p>
<p>倘然有人問他：</p>
<p>「爲什麼還不到內地去？」</p>
<p>那麼，他的回答就是——</p>
<p>「不去了；因爲上海也有工作做：譬如下一個鐘點我就得去赴一個讀書會，再下一個鐘點我又得去赴一個文藝座談會。」</p>
<p>說完，他低下了頭，又用那枝「派克」眞空管筆寫起字來了：</p>
<p>「本月份應購的書：大衆哲學，思想方法論，新哲學大綱，辯瞪法全程，政治經濟學講話，論政黨，列甯主義初步，……」</p>
<p>本月份又忽忽地過去了，似乎並未看到他冒過這許多書，於是就有好事者抱着懷疑的態度問他：</p>
<p>「本月份應購的書都買來了嗎？」</p>
<p>「沒有。——唉！書簡直貴得買不起！」</p>
<p>但毎天早晨放在他底枕頭底那塊玻璃板上的却還是：四塊白脫土司和一杯正冒着熱汽的牛奶咖啡。而新近被壓在班璃板下的却正是那張「本月份應購的書」的名單。</p>
<h3>懶惰的園丁</h3>
<p>— 劍青作</p>
<h3>必走</h3>
<p>— 耿之</p>
<p>某種地方是「必到」的，到後是「必言」的。然而千萬不可長久，必走！至少在散塲之前必走；再至少在有人巳走之後必走。否則，我亦猶人耳，曷足以示其聲價！</p>
<p>可說，某處也在開會，要我去，所以必須先走一步。反正某處是否在開會，無人查究；即使某處有開會而尙未到時間，也不妨在小弄堂裹兜兜，或任何有趣處所躭擱一下。儘可說，某處還有宴會，不能不到，所以此地只好失陪。反正沒有人跟在你的後面，如果沒有吃飽，肚子餓了，就此回家吃冷泡飽，常麗些，簡直在家再吃一頓正餐，又何妨哉。</p>
<p>這裹面的妙用，當然不必我多說，誰都會知道。我就曾在什麼集會或宴會中，對於這些必走的「忙人」或「要人」，一再發過欲羨的誠意，以爲他們眞是天之驕子，社會的棟樑，所以處處需要他們，他們一時趕不及，必走。</p>
<p>同樣，一個郎中先生—現在稱「醫師」—也可以坐着轎子—現在坐包車或汽車—一天到晚在街上走，表示他的生意興隆，出診很多。一　病家，三個指頭一搭，或者聽診器一取出來，馬上就走。那就是說：到病家之前，必走，必多走；到病家之後，必走，必早走，這樣，這個郎巾或醫師，就可以成爲「名醫」或「國手」了。</p>
<p>同樣，一個敎員先生，兼幾處課，也可以在一處未了一課還差若干分鐘方才完畢時，捲起　　，就走能者多勞，學生準會這樣想。</p>
<p>同樣，紅倌人出局侑酒，胡琴一響，高唱兩聲，外面喊轉局，就此「晏歇會」。嘖嘖嘖，究兌紅倌人，席上的人準會這樣說。</p>
<p>同樣，同樣，……其他不勝其同樣。</p>
<p>不過以上的必走，都著重在時間上，雖然有效用，而必走的路徑，却也不能不加以注意，否則就未免顧此失彼，美中不足了。</p>
<p>第一，必走終南山一般的「捷徑」。當初要做官的人，只要住到終南山中去，自嗚淸高，皇帝就會來宜召進京，賞以高官大　。現在呢，終南山也許路太遠，不時髦，就不妨神而明之，活用一下。最簡單的，只要有錢，自然到外國的「終南山」去住上幾時，就會有「聖旨」下來了。此外，或橫衝直撞，或精琢細磨，在某一界熬成了某種資格，一樣可以有官做，因此某一界都可以成爲「捷徑」。</p>
<p>第二，必走表面上的「大路」。據說，乾嘉時的某道學先生，就以「行不由徑」成了名，雖然有一天在鄕下遇雨，跳過了水溝，爲收童所見，給牧童一個錢，呌他不要說出來，而仍不害共爲必走大路的正人君子。於是今之欲成名者，儘可以做出規行矩步，或博施濟衆的樣子來，反正沒有收童看見你，而看見了你，你給他一個錢，他一定會感恩不盡，逢人宣揚你的大德的。</p>
<p>第三，似乎還可以走那有神效的「內綫」。內綫，極細極微之物也，安可以走？然而走的人甚多，而共效用也最大。因爲據說綫是會聯擊事物的，所以籍着牠，也可以達到你的目的。不過綫上的人旣很多，又很容易斷，走奢要格外小心些才是。</p>
<p>此外，某種路徑，又必有某種走法，也不能不略事一提，以窺必走之全貌。</p>
<p>看見了難民，閉目而走；聽見了國事，掩耳而走；看見了少艾，「目逆血送之」而走；在某塲所作「狐步」走，作「湯鍋」走；聽見京巾徵求「不求聞達」的高才，在道上奔馳而走；假使做了官，在松下喝道走，在花間坐橋走；聽說某處有大財可發，作附　之蟻走；……最重要的，一遇危險，一有苦差使，就述忙作三十六着中的上着之走！常然，這些「走」法都是「必」然的，假使你要走着上面所說的各種路。</p>
<p>但這些是他人所必走者，在我則無路可「走」，無法可「走」，不得已而「走」之，「必」也江湖乎！</p>

<h3>烽火中</h3>
<p>— 周燕</p>
<p>十二　陳鎭長的隱痛</p>
<p>葉團長的部隊，這時已退到合浦鎭西北二十里的楓林鎭。方慧率同救護班和民衆，帶了受傷勇士和戰利品，一路尋訪着，直到第二天上午，方始歸隊。當她把夜半急智殺敵的經過告訴她哥哥的時候，在旁邊聽着的葉團長的僚屬，個個都贊美不絕，朱參謀允其高興，他連聲嚷着說：</p>
<p>『我一定要把這段光榮的事蹟記下來。現在我們雖然暫時和上邊隔絕了，不過將來中央一定會特派負責大員到游擊區裹來整理和聯絡的，到那時我就可以把這段事蹟報告上去，請他傳令嘉獎。』</p>
<p>『這又何必呢，小孩子家，偶然幹掉了幾個敵人，也算不得什麼功勞。』葉團長很謙遜的說。</p>
<p>『不然，』朱參謀正色說：『像葉小姐這種智勇雙全計殲敵軍的舉動，正是我們抗戰史上最出色的材料。我們這次抗戰是消耗戰，能够把我們一個拚掉他們一個也巳够本了，現在殺掉了他們三個，而我們却一個都沒有損失，還不値得嘉獎嗎？」</p>
<p>葉團長也就不再說什麼，他一面忙着在楓林鎭上佈防，以防×軍追蹤進攻，一面派人到合浦鎭附近去打聽消息。打聽的人回來報告，×軍攻下了有「小上海」之稱的合浦鎭，似乎已經心滿意足，此刻正忙於燒殺姦淫，刦掠財貨，一時沒有繼續進攻的企圖。不過有一件出於大家意外的事，就是合浦鎭的鎭長陳兆前，居然投降了×軍，出面担任僞「維持會」會長了。</p>
<p>『眞是知人知面不知心！像陳鎭長這樣的忠厚老實人，居然也竟甘冒大不韙，出仟「維持會」僞職，我從今再不敢輕信天下士了。』葉團長氣忿忿的說。</p>
<p>和豐木行主人蔡和豐也跟着軍隊逃了出來，他和陳鎮長是多年摯友，聽說他做了「維持會」會長，也有些牛信半疑。他本來想回合浦鎭去探望他的木行是否依然無恙，於是便來見棄團長說：（三八）</p>

<h3>紀念「上海光復」</h3>
<p>— 流風</p>
<p>在上海變爲「孤島」的今日，在抗戰進入到新的階段的今日，我們四百萬上海的同胞來紀念「上海光復」，這意義是多麼的深長，而又是多麼的耐人尋味呀！</p>
<p>十三年前的今天，國民革命軍已進達龍華，上海的工人大衆以及一切的愛國民衆，爲了進行嚮應北伐軍的行動，爲了從事結束上海反革命軍閥的統治，就在這天的正午十二時，上海總工會發佈第二次總同盟罷工的命令，全上海絕大多數的工人都參加了這次罷工，接着，就開始武裝的起義，馬上奪取軍警的武裝，並佔領各個區城，向駐軍車站的直魯聯軍進攻。經過兩天一晚（從二十一日正午到二十二日下午六時）的劇烈的巷戰，反革命的軍閥是畢竟在大上海英勇的工人大衆以及一切的愛國民衆的鬥爭之中被擊潰，而滾出了大上海！</p>
<p>我們不能忽略當時的國民革命是反帝反封建，所以上海工人大衆的武裝起義，也只是反帝反封建的一種英勇的表示。當然，這種反帝反封建的任務在當時是並沒有完成，而在今天的抗戰中，我們是要在反×反漢奸的任務之下來完成的。</p>
<p>三月二十一日的「上海光復」，是給了我們什麼敎訓呢？一言以蔽之，是：民衆的力量是不可輕視的！也就是說：眞理是任何蠻橫的勢力所不能克服的，反之，任何蠻橫的勢力，是只有在眞理的偉力之下崩潰而滅亡，這是歷史定下的最公正而也最無情的鐵則！</p>
<p>三月二十一日的武裝起義之前，在上海，還有兩次的起義。自第二次起義失敗之後，惡魔的孫傳芳是用殘酷的手段來屠殺工人大衆以及一切的愛國民衆，用大刀來砍殺革命領袖以及散傳單看傳單的愛國民衆。一個二十幾歲的上海人，還可以想得出那時在南市閘北各處：電桿上懸掛着首級，道路旁橫拋着屍體，而殘暴的所「謂大刀隊」，在街頭上不絕地巡行着。……</p>
<p>然而惡魔造種恐嚇的手段有沒有嚇退了全上海的愛國民衆呢？沒有！非但沒有，而惡魔却反在全上海的愛國民衆英勇的鬥爭之下而結束了牠的橫變的命運！</p>
<p>今天，上海是變成了「孤島」了，全上海四百萬的市民，所過的日子，實比十三年之前的是有過之無不及。但是，大上海是有過光榮的「三·二一」，而這光榮的「三·二一」，也正是大上海的愛國民衆所創造成功的！所以我們今天在紀念「三·二一」的「上海光復」，應該更百千倍地振奮起我們「三·二一」的精神來，我們要在「抗載必勝建國必成」的信念之下，不斷地奮鬥着，那末，第二個「三·二一」，第二個「上海光復」，是不久就要到來的？</p>
<p>全上海的同胞們！我們紀念「三·二一」，從今起，我們百千倍地振奮起我們「三·二一」的精神來，眞理是在我們這一邊，光明是即將駕臨了！</p>
<h3>歐局雜談</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>恐更有甚於此者</p>
<p>希特勒違背了慕尼黑恊定，侵佔捷克，英法諸國，曉得上了希特勒先生的當，他最後一次領土要求的話，完全說謊，於是大家譴責希特勒，說其不顧信義，違反諾言。但是希特勒先生的熊度非常鎭靜而冷淡，以爲「笑罵由他笑罵，好官我自爲之」。余友某君，曾遊武林，春光明媚，泛舟西湖，見西子湖畔，一僧正在調笑一女郎，某君指而笑之曰：賊禿亦要調侃婦女耶？該僧聞之，答曰；不但調笑，更有甚於此者。今希特勒答復英法等國的話，恐怕亦是如此，不但捷克，恐更有甚於此者。</p>
<p>張伯倫造了幾百萬浮屠</p>
<p>張伯倫先生，因希特勒違背諾言，前晚在伯明罕演說，他自已還誇張綏靖政策的功勞。謂「余游德之第一目的，卒能達到，歐洲和平，賴以保全，苟無此行，則歐洲今日，哭者不知幾千萬家」。誠然，倘張伯倫先生不到德國一行，大戰業已開始，也未可知，則數百萬或數千萬生靈，早已付諸塗炭。我俗謂「救人一命，勝造七級浮屠」，張伯倫先生眞是功德無量，，不知造了幾百萬幾千萬浮屠；但是張伯倫先生之功德愈高，則世界之浮屠愈多，天下眞可從此太平矣，而張伯倫先生之大功，於焉告成。</p>
<h3>難爲了爸爸</h3>
<p>— 燕華</p>
<p>“listen,Darling”</p>
<p>米高梅公司出品　國泰戲院開映</p>
<p>當茀萊第巴塞洛繆在「塊肉餘生」中，第一次顯露了他那種幽靜，沉默，一個英國年靑孩子特殊的風格以後，這面目秀麗崛起的童星，也就爲世界影迷所愛好了。</p>
<p>以後他父以同樣的風格，主演了感人更深的「怒海餘生」「赤手勤王」等片，從此，巴塞洛繆確定了他在銀幕上的性格與個性。那就是：他善於飾演一種不十分懂得世故，而性情又非常良善的貴挨家庭中的孩子，「塊肉餘生」中是如此，「赤手勤王」也是如此。</p>
<p>巴塞洛繆如使以這樣個性繼續發展下去，對於他雖然已經成爲一種定型的角色，但是他將來的成功是無限止的。</p>
<p>但在這「難爲了爸爸」中，道位一向以沉默，幽靜，氣質高貴的風格出現的巴塞洛繆，他的性格完全給變換了，你看他：是那樣粗野而魯莽，是那樣頑皮而嚕囌，在道裹，他飾演一個汽油站上工人的侄子，他帮助他的小女友，簪她媽媽找了一偭愛人。全篇故事，是沉浸在純粹奇異的幻想中，它是通過了一個羅曼的克的形式，寫一個有子女母親的再醮，表面上好像是一張敎育影片，而實際，却是一篇離奇十足幻想的戀愛插曲。</p>
<p>在形式上看，這影片是提出了一個婦女問題的，就是當一個丈夫死去以後，妻子沒有接受到什麼遺產，她底有兩個正待敎育的孩子，和家中須付出的大量賬單，在這情形之下，一僩做妻子的人應該怎樣呢？我們以爲：這不僅僅是一個婦女問題，也是整個的社會問題，在像現在這樣社會中，有誰能解答這個問題呢？假如我們比較樂觀的話，我們可以提兩點：（一）母親去找一個職業；（二）孩子送到義務學校去。但要使母親找不到工作，子女們不能找到一般公家免費的學校，又怎麼辦呢？</p>
<p>卽使退一萬步講，這問題的確是無法解决的，尤其是道金元社會中，婦女問題原是嚴重的社會問題的一環呵！</p>
<p>然而在好萊塢劇作者的筆下，這些嚴重的問題是容易解决得很的，就是讓道位妻子再嫁一個丈夫就算了，假如她找的對像不是她自己所愛好的，那麼她的子女會替她拉攏的。而現在被廣告員翻成的譯名「難爲了爸爸」，如使照現在劇情看，把它換成「難爲了媽媽」，似乎還確切得多呢！</p>
<p>負着敎育文化重大使命的電影藝術，落在象這樣影片劇作者手裹，的確要使人感慨系之的。</p>
<p>劇作奢爲了要抓取觀衆，於是不得不誇張喜劇的形式，使一向保持優秀成續的巴塞洛繆，變成一個乎　丑角的頑皮孩子，當他盤問那年靑的律師有沒有眷屬，有沒有訂婚等問題的時候，的確會使觀衆譁笑的，於是冉加上那位善於歌唱的裘娣茄倫，那個組野的小弟弟司可兜比凱等，使這個悲劇的故事，被濃郁的哄笑所掩飾過去了。</p>
<p>劇本的編製，是不很完整的，那位保險公司董事長的出塲，簡直可以刪去。</p>
<p>演出部份，導演盡可能的在製作笑料，如勃大演講時故意加入許多小噱頭；比利等遇見臭鼬，使人掩鼻而過；都作爲全劇笑料的中心的。</p>
<p>巴塞洛繆還相當努力，但我私人感覺，總不歡喜他演這個近乎丑角的角色；裘娣一共唱了三四支歌，其餘飾母親的曼麗愛絲脫及飾律師的華脫辟靜等都因出塲戲不多，給人的印像也很淡薄。</p>
<h3>怎樣「消遣」</h3>
<p>— 新良</p>
<p>每一個人，「空閒」總是有的；做舉生的，學堂裹散了課，功課又做完了，其餘剩下來的時候，就是「空閒」；做工人的，當一切工作都幹妥了後，也要感到「空閒」；即使是那些碌碌終日，做一天吃一天的做小生意的，也未必會沒有「空閒」，你瞧，他們不是常常在街頭玩起紙牌戲來嗎？由此看來，無論是忙得不堪的人，他總有「空間」。因爲有了「空閒」，又有了一般人的所謂「消遺」，就是怎樣來消磨這「空閒」的辰光的方法。</p>
<p>談到「消遺」，有些人恐怕就會聯想到抽烟，喝酒，嫖，賭等等，惡習慣上去，好像除了這種消遺方法之外，就再沒有其他的消遺的樣子。他們都說「不過消遣消遣罷了。」於是，成日成夜地只知道在跑冰塲，跑狗塲，跳舞塲裹抱女人，找尋刺激。這種消遣的方法，說是在消磨空閑的辰光，還是說在浪費光陰來得適合些，切實些。</p>
<p>在上海，因爲感染着了這種消遣的方法，而墮落的人，正不知有多少。然而，在事實上，其餘好的，有益身心的消遺也有許多，總之「消遺」的有益與否，必先視個人的主意如何，方能下斷。在下面，吾將介紹諸位以幾種稍有意味的消遺方法，非但可以增進智識，並且還可以陶冶身心呢？</p>
<p>剪報</p>
<p>這種消遣的方法，眞是挺有趣味的，比起「又麻雀」來，其興緻也不見得如何低少。或者，也許會有人說，這種消遺太麻煩了，每天的報紙看過了，又何必去把它們成方地，成塊地剪下來呢。要不知報紙乃是人們生活的紀錄，確是有剪下來保存起來的價値的。所以剪報不一定限於重要的電聞，評論，專載，小品，新詩，以及其他的照片，即使廣告，都可以剪下來貼在舊簿子上，以作你不時的翻閱，並且當作一種消遺」。如果你自已有作品登在報上的話，那末，這種剪報的工作，則更是感到興趣了。</p>
<p>集郵</p>
<p>集郵在吾國人的心目中當作消遺的玩意兒的歷史，還不能够算長，直至近來，這種有趣味的消遺，才自歐美傳來，而街頭的舊郵票攤，郵票社也好像見得容易而多了。的確集郵是有益身心的，對於吾們的史地常識，尤有裨益；每一張紅紅綠綠的，有着美麗的，動人的圖畫的郵票，能够告訴你這一個國家裹的風俗，人情，地形，文化，以及語言與其他的一切事情。雖然，這一種消遣，比起上一種來，要稍爲貴族化一些，而眞正的集郵，也要化上一些兒錢，但是，集郵所得到的興趣與益處，却可以與所付的代價相抵的。</p>
<p>不用說得，大家都知道，現在的中國，正在一個艱苦的環境下打開一條大路來，這種工作自然是困難的。那末，每一個當國民的一份千的，豈可以再用惡劣的消遺，來浪費時間嗎？試問在今日道個充滿了「節的救國」「獻金運動」的呼聲的時候，還能容得我們作那些無益的，有害的嫖賭的消遺嗎</p>

<p>朱愛人是和她的義母老章醫師住在一宅，那房子就在醫院近傍，是一座半中西式的三層樓。這房子也並不寬大，僅足敷用，但那個院子倒不小，周圍有些樹石花木。朱愛人知道何家兩位小姐要來，便在自已的房間隔壁，收拾出兩間屋子來，讓他們居住。她早知道她們不願意冷淸淸的住到自由村去，卽使要到自由村去，最好要由自己陪她們去才可。雖然朱愛人的母親，不是住在自由村嗎？但她是一位樸直組野的老農婦，如何與這何家兩位小姐周旋呢？這時朱愛人的汽車，一直開到自己家裹的院子裹，那時夕陽斜掛林梢，天還沒有完全落黑。階台前，巳有七八人迎接出來，她們都知道這是朱愛人在美國的同學，是姓何的一對孿生女兒，新從香港來，愛人今天就是到蘇州車站去迎　她們的但何家兩位小姐，却對於這出來迎接的七八人，都不認識是誰。便是朱愛人一一給她們介紹，她們恐怕也一時不易記淸。原來這七八人，大半是婦孺醫院的醫師，有的住在老章醫師這座宅子內，有的不住在老章醫師這座宅子內的。她們聽說今天朱愛人去接兩位新客來了，道兩位新客，又是一對雙胸胎，她們都得來看看。朱愛人當時也的略的給何家兩位小姐介紹一下，明知她們一時也記不淸楚。好在不到幾天，就可以廝混熱了。何家兩位小姐，又去見了老章醫師，老章醫師也十分歡迎。因爲早就聽朱愛人說過了，知道是朱愛人要好的同學，又說了好久，要到這裹來探望愛人，當然要盡一個招待之責的。况且老章醫師又是非常的和藹可親，因此一見也就十分親洽。她說：『我們有許多地方，恐怕有些招待不周，要請原諒。因爲我和愛人兩人，爲了醫務上事，就覺得很忙。我是管理那個婦孺醫院與育嬰院全體的事，從總管一直到庶務，都要問到，看病收生等事，就不能再管了。關於看病收生等事，都是由愛人總其大成，又要管婦孺醫院的這些人，又要管育嬰院裹的這些孩子，一時實在也忙不過來。好在兩位小姐是至好，不客氣的呢。（六六）</p>

<h3>長空萬里不久開攝　中國空軍上銀幕</h3>
<p>— 沙璐明</p>
<p>自全國軍民以最英勇，最堅决和最神聖的姿熊舉起了抗戰的大議以來；我們空軍不但也是給予侵略者以重大而且悲慘的打擊，並昭示全世界說，中國空軍是偉大的，是勇敢的！</p>
<p>中國空軍在委員長領導之下，空軍作戰人員是將再接再厲予敵人以打擊，並且以突擊姿態來保衛自己祖國的長空了。中國空軍正像一朵奇葩，是在含苞怒放中，是在完成其粉碎侵略，守衛祖國的最艱苦，却最光榮的任務。是的，中國空軍將在這雙重任務中不斷地成長起來了。</p>
<p>而今，我們對於中國空軍將上銀幕的喜訊更是欣慰萬倍。亳無疑義地，將為中國電影界寫下光輝燦爛的一頁了。</p>
<p>戰事以來，中央宣傳部的中央電影攝影塲裹底工作人員，時常出入於南北東西各戰塲，將前綫悲壯雄偉，可歌可泣的實情；通過了鏡頭，膠片，運輸而映入於後方廣大的民衆眼簾內。現在更有一部以空軍為題材的「長空萬里」影片了，不久就要開始拍攝了。編劇是「大路」的導演孫瑜先生，事前中宣部曾商請航空委員會派員共同參加此攝片，編導，技術工作。航空委員會就派在假的航空員謝濤濬君恊助。謝君曾說：</p>
<p>「……當他（指孫渝）誠摯地埋頭於這部影片的編劇工作的時候，我便在他旁邊幫助他，告訴他一些關於中國空軍的故事，和空軍駕駛，作戰技術上的各種問題。我是一個飛行員，我不懂怎樣寫一個好劇本，但我知道怎樣駕駛飛機，怎樣和敵人作戰，怎樣保衛祖國的領空：我要把這些事貢獻給電影界。還有，便是我要正確地說出我的伙伴們的鬥爭，英勇的和犧牲的壯烈情形。這些，編劇者是要把來作為他的描寫的人物底對象用的。……」</p>
<p>這部「長空萬里」影片，的確在中國電影史上是劃時代而具有偉大意義的事蹟。在這裏，我們謹向「長空萬里」的一切工作人員致神聖的敬禮！</p>
<p>回顧我們「孤島」電影界，正是妖氣迷漫的時侯，電影界工作人員應如何奮發，聞鷄起舞；我們應該不但保持過去的進步的精神，而且來發揮這種精神，配以新的不妥恊精神，努力掙扎，努力爭鬥！</p>
<h3>秀蘭鄧波兒　歡喜飼養兔子</h3>
<p>— 步之</p>
<p>秀蘭鄧波兒是「天才」嗎？不是她只是跟別的小孩子一樣，具有一種頑皮的個性而已。然而，頑皮的孩子的天資大概都是聰明的，秀蘭鄧波兒的「聰明」能够被她的環境以及敎育所利用，於是她就顯得比別的孩子更聰明了！假使她沒有一種好的敎育和一個好的環境的帮助，恐怕到今天，或者一直到老死，說不定仍然是一個沒沒無聞的人，跟別的埋沒了聰明的孩子一樣；這，從唯命論這方面說來，秀蘭鄧波兒確實是當世的幸運兒。</p>
<p>秀蘭鄧波兒很喜歡飼養兔子，可是，如果詢問她「為什麼要愛兔子」，她是答不出話來的，原因是她自己也不知所以歡喜兔子的理由。</p>
<p>秀蘭鄧波兒正在牙牙畢呌「爸爸」「媽媽」的時候，有一天，她媽媽抱她到動物園去玩要，就在那個陳列着奇獸怪禽的動物園裹，她的目光被一羣雜色的兔子吸住了，她驚奇而愉快地在媽媽的懷抱中跳躍着。為什麼，當她看老虎！看獅子，看豺狼豹象時，却沒有這樣的表示呢？她媽媽就以為自己的女兒和兔子有緣。</p>
<p>後來由於秀蘭鄧波兒的要求，她媽媽替她買了許多兔子的玩具歸來；皮製的，布製的，木製的，泥製的，都成為她房中的點綴品。</p>
<p>年紀漸漸大了。一個偶然的機會被電影的導演發現了她的聰明；她就爬上銀幕紅了起來。這時她因為每月的收入是那麼豐富，她媽媽便投她所好替她佈置了一個樂園；舉凡生活，敎育，游戲，事業方面，無不巨細皆備。然而，她媽媽却忘了替她闢一個養兔子的園地，她不會想到孩子果眞要飼養兔子的。</p>
<p>結果，秀蘭鄧波兒提議了</p>
<p>第一次，只買了五隻兔子。在園地的一小角，造了一隻小木棚，算是供給這五隻兔子睡眠的。於是，秀蘭鄧波兒在每天工作表上，又多了一種活動；早晨，黃昏，不論天晴落雨，她都得去看看她的心愛的兔子。三個月之後，有一個早晨再去看兔子，兔子却一隻都瞧不見，她哭了起來，她說兔子給野貓吃了。然而事實上不，兔子因為到了繁殖時期，挖了地窟，躲在地下層生小兔，所以不在黑夜，牠們就嬾於出來了。</p>
<p>若干日過去了，小兔一大羣便是現在秀蘭鄧波兒的眼前了。這樣一代一代的繁殖下，到現在，她的塲上的兔子，已經有了數百隻，而那個兔圜的面積也為着需要而擴大了。從前是秀蘭鄧波兒自己去喂草給兔子吃的，後來也就另外僱用了看管兔子的人來代替自己工作了。</p>
<p>如今，飼養兔子在秀蘭鄧波見的事業方面是十分發達的；社會上就把「養兔專家」榮譽的稱呼送給了她。</p>
<p>僅僅照養兔這一點看來，也就可以證明是環境與敎育利用了秀蘭鄧波兒的聰明，使她做了所謂「天才」的幸運兒。</p>

<p>南國美人陳雲裳，來滬主演「木蘭從軍」，居然美譽廣播，一舉成名。第二片「雲裳仙子」，是一部新型歌舞片，現於不久期內，亦將攝製完成。以前，她原是三折肱於此道的歌舞班出身，所以「雲裳仙子」這片子，更足大展所長，又是一部拿手好戲。</p>
<p>她在香港方面，為有「啟明」「南洋」「民族」等三家公司，早前訂有五片合同，須待回去拍演。故於「雲裳仙子」工作完畢之後，便將「榮歸故鄕」去去再來。</p>

<p>找房子在目前是一件最困難的問題。談瑛因為找來找去，我不到一所適當的住宅；自己於無辦法下，只能在霞飛路亞爾培路那裹一家外國公庽中闢室暫居。同時，她的老母和一位弟弟，亦於他處賃定一個亭子樓給她們，另作安頓了。</p>
<p>她說：「獨個兒住在公厲裹，不但太覺寂寞，且亦極多不便，現在仍想找尋較適當的房子」。</p>
<p>顧蘭君賣花贈照</p>
<p>顧蘭君和她姊姊梅君都為愛花成癖，便於選取關係；她們早在靜安寺路大華路口開上一　梅蘭花店，專售各類美麗鮮花。這樣分香同好，共助艷妝，那是多麼雅韻欲流的藝人韻事。這幾天，蘭君小姐主演的「武則天」新片，正在大上海戲院出映；她為這片子是自己相當滿意的作品，因又特備大量武則天劇照，在梅蘭花店每天分送顧客。據她表示：「同時也為梅蘭花店辦了剛値一年，算是留作紀念的」。這樣，她這一幅美麗的贈品，却還具有雙重的意義呢！</p>
<h3>葉盛蘭等的奇雙會</h3>
<p>— 希同</p>
<p>葉盛蘭的「奇變會」是著名的。記得幾年以前，我在新光大戲院，看他和華慧麟合演的「寫狀」，溫馨細膩，使我至今猶難忘記。「寫狀」恰巧排在熱鬧的武戲之後；這愉快，像是在一片沙漠之中尋到了綠洲，有的是靑草和流水——這將成為我永遠的夢境。</p>
<p>為了追尋這夢境，我又在前幾天特地到黃金大戲院去看葉盛蘭興章遏雲合演的全本奇雙會。（實際上仍只是後本，因為是從哭監演起的）但是這樣的夢境已不能再得了！大的夢境只能永遠讓牠在記憶中，是不能追尋的吧？</p>
<p>葉盛蘭的優點是：桂枝出塲坐定後即哭，他把頭稍俯，眼睛對桂枝瞅着，所謂一半兒愛，一半兒嗔，最能表出此種神情；聽說監長被桂枝打開，他雖是說了一聲「唗」，仍在斥資之中帶着溫和，表示他對於妻子的摯愛；直到說「豈有此理」時，方纔眞的動怒：像這樣由喜至怒的過程，變動得極為自然可喜。其次，說到「待我前去問她」並不拉衣角，（其實衣服是兩岔的）只是左手拉自己右手的衣袖，用右手指對着桂枝指出，亦頗簡捷入情。復次，說到「令尊另有可生之路，」親切地拍桂枝的肩，也很逼眞。最後，被桂枝開了玩笑，立起來像煞有介事地莊嚴地走進去，也比彎腰笑指着說「豈有此理」來得新頴有趣。</p>
<p>但盛蘭也不免有缺點，就是：唱「聽妻言罷我心中苦」時，苦字不會拖腔。按劇學月刊四卷十二期曹心泉譜，此句苦字的工尺該是「上尺工六尺工六上尺上四合四。」（遏雲也有同樣的唱句，就不曾錯一並且，「他與我趙寵一般相同一好像板也太快。其次，「闖　」一塲，哭得過火，也令人有失眞之感、</p>
<p>遏　此以戲甚好，　　亦甜，惟因連演「打魚殺家」及此戲之故，自然吃力，故未能全神貫注。盛蘭唱「聽妻言罷」一段時，她以背朝着台外，這是不合理的。如果說她不會聽見盛蘭的話，那末她怎麼又說「相公也是被晚娘趕出來的麼」呢？我想，這不能獨責遏雲，一般演平劇的有此毛病的很多。就是，不把戲當作一種嚴肅的藝術，隨隨便便，甲唱的時候，乙就滿不管事，不是喝茶，就是休息，把融合和關聯的境界打破。被拉入衙後，遏雲驚慌的神情也未能充分表現，似應作呆瞪狀，不該作揖下拜。</p>
<p>貫盛習的李奇是成功的，唱做均佳，哭聲尤好，惟老態未臻絕境，為美中不足。</p>

<p>「四郎探母」這齣戲，在梆子及皮黃班裏都巳盛行了數十百年，從前余叔岩的祖父余三勝曾以此劇享名常時，後來泰腔鬚生泰斗郭實臣（即老元元紅）復以悲壯蒼凉的　調，深獲　曲家的　賞，於是「探母」一折，幾成為同光年間家喻戶曉婦孺皆知的名劇了。其實皮黃班的「探母」，的確是從梆子班脫胎下來的。及至伶界大王　鑫培博採衆家之長，自成一派，此劇遂益馳名於世；而他當時所最欽佩的除了皮黃班的前輩　長庚，余三勝，王九齡諸人外，並目還把這位與他分廷抗禮的郭寶臣崇拜的和天神一般，有許多的譯腔裹，我們都可以發現出梆子腔的韻味來，由此就可揣知他老先生是如何的愛慕秦腔的悲音，及如何運用他的靈機將郭調的菁華摘取了來安揰在西皮的「哭頭」和其他的哀音裹，以刺激觀衆的聽覺，往往眞會使台下人隨之落淚，當時全稱之曰亡國之音，豈料此種亡國之音，不但能普及南北，風行一時，而目歷久弗衰，於今尤烈，即如「探母」一劇，幾成為各劇院最能呌座之譚派鬚牛戲。竟遏雲楊實森此次南來，未及一月，即重演三次，而每次上座，都在九成以上，這也足見該劇號召力之强，與顧曲的人們是十分的重視於它了。不佞素喜探求劇中人物與吾國史地上之關係，現在讓我把「探母」劇中「出關」的「關」名，寫了出來，與諸同好研究一下，並且還附帶着叙述亡淸西太后和太監安得海（即紅極一時之小安子）的一段秘史，因為西太后寵幸安得海的起源，就是因他曾經捨命闖過此關，救了西后母子的性命，而據一位軍界的老戲迷講起，此關即是當年楊四郎所過的關；其實「楊家將」的故　，壓根兒就靠不住，等到編排出「探母」「雁門關」這些戲來，那就越發不足信了，不過世人都有個「製造古蹟」和「附會其詞」的通病，我們姑且認為「楊四郎出關探母」是實有其事，那麼，道位軍界老戲迷的推斷，也就算有相當的準確，因為他是六旬以外的老軍務，會在吳祿貞部下當過排長，後來也作到師長地位，不但有學識，愛看戲，而且對於史地極熟，這個「關」是他曾經久駐的地方，他推情度理，根據古今的地理上講，遂毅然對我說道：「如其四郎過關，眞有這麼回事，那麼，所過的關，就是現在的古北口了。」</p>

<h3>金融　散戶傾售　現金價初平繼跌</h3>
<p>降達二〇五八元收盤</p>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市況、初開頗形平穩、雖一般力弱多戶、因鑒歐洲局勢不定、而紛起吐售、但以某金號吸購亦殷、故形勢尚平、下午因金號納胃轉呆、且賣方未見減少、故市勢遂疲、又降低至二千〇五十八元收盤、結果則續跌八元、各方人心仍疲、交易尚旺、約七百數十兩、銀樓飾金亦掛小一元、海關金則仍呆定、中英純金等均微上漲、</p>
<p>烚赤跌八元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初無做開、迨至十時光景、始見某銀號賣予錢兌業五十兩、二千〇六十九元爲開盤價、較上週末做高三元、開後錢兌業卽原價復吐予某金號、繼之銀樓幫互做五十兩、及金號售予銀樓幫五十兩、價亦均六十九元、此後雖某金號續來吸購、無如錢兌業均代本地客幫脫售、故爲狀略疲、某金號又進證券幫五十兩、價六十八元、現金號賣予錢兌業廿兩、六十七元、後某金號又進錢兌業五十兩、爲六十六元、其時錢兌業賣意轉淡、故潛勢遂止跌轉漲、錢兌業互做五十兩、爲六十七元、某金號又進錢兌業五十兩、價七十元、時已十一時三刻、近午錢兌業又賣予銀樓幫五十兩、爲六十七元五角、午後潛勢復疲、蓋散戶吐售仍殷、而金號進意轉淡所致、首由錢兌業賣予金號五十兩、爲六十四元、繼之又賣予同業五十兩、爲六十五元、後錢兌業互做五十兩、六十二元、逾刻許後錢兌業又售予客戶五十兩、價六十元、時已三時三刻、後至四時〇五分、錢兌業又互做三十兩、二千〇五十八元爲晚收價、較上週六軋跌八元、（已連跌三天共計三十八元）、全天十二元差度、現金號之本牌金售出價二千〇六十五元、收進二千〇五十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、均無做開、</p>
<p>飾金小一元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金、每兩兌出、初因烚赤潛勢頗平、致未更動、迨至午後傍晚四時十分、因烚金又疲、故亦掛小一元、大同行懸二百〇九元、新同行爲二百〇七元、收進〇一元、</p>
<p>海關金不動</p>
<p>中央銀行之中國現金收買價已漲至一千二百十二元六角、掛牌海關金仍未更動、計二元三角九分六厘、上海標準標金價亦昂三角、乃十八日倫敦電英純金每盎司長半辦士所致云、</p>
<h3>英美匯兌轉漲　本市美匯買風已戢</h3>
<p>匯市昨以英美間匯率突扒跌轉漲、故本市美匯止風頓戢、雖中途洋行界結款較殷、但以外電香港拋塞頗湧、且外行亦賣意轉濃、致形勢一度曾回硬至十六元〇九三七五、結果則未分榮辱、而英匯雖洋行亦來扒結、無如港電暨英行滙豐等供塞亦殷、故爲狀頗形穩定、始終站定於八便士二五、當日仍鮮變動、交易尚旺、至港匯初因洋行猛扒不已、故潛勢一度曾軟至五十五元一二五、卒以華行賣意轉濃、故回硬至五十五元二五、結果較上週末軋緊一二五、</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條近期續縮二五、遠期亦續降一二五、紐約銀價仍平、倫敦生金長半便士、匯兌英對美大七毫、對法長三生丁、對滬未更、美對英昂一二五、對法升〇六二五、對滬勿動、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開賣價、英匯八便士二五、美匯十六元〇六二五、較上週末均無榮辱、開後各大洋行雖稍有結款、但以外行供給亦殷、致爲狀頗形平穩、洋行結進滙豐英匯八便士二五、兼之又扒結華比某行美匯十六元〇六二五、滙豐掛牌揭曉勿動、及白銀平衡稅揭曉續跌一分二五、計徵百分之五·〇〇、此後外電香港突來拋塞、故潛勢略硬、港電賣予有利美匯十六元〇九三七五、繼之洋行忽猛扒港匯、是以形勢帶軟、洋行購結荷蘭華行港匯五十五元一二五與二五、迨午收銀行賣價與晨開無異、</p>
<p>後市洋行結進滙豐英匯八便士二五、後又扒結某行美匯十六元〇六二五、繼之港電賣予有利英匯八便士二五、兼美匯十六元〇九三七五、最後洋行吸進華行港匯五十五元二五、狀況亦平、迨晚收銀行賣價、英匯八便士二五、美匯十六元〇六二五、結果較上週六午收、英美均未分軒輊、港匯軋軟一二五、</p>
<p>日鈔廣布</p>
<p>上週六英純金漲半便士、英美匯兌升一二五、昨日本埠外匯、洋行需要尚旺、銀行供給甚殷、美匯一度鬆動、結果較上週六無分榮辱、烚赤開盤尚平、嗣浮多了結甚殷、金號錢兌業等吸納未暢、微趨軟弱、下午散戶出籠更旺、進者更稀、市價下跌趨烈、最低價收盤、勢甚衰弱、外幣因烚赤虛弱、英美金鎊、出籠稍殷、市價下降較多、美金票外銀行收納頗暢、各外幣因人心微虛、多數下降、日金票交易頗盛、新券如一圓及五十錢（日金票半元等）、市間散播甚廣、公會交易尚盛、承泰出勤泰進美金鎊五十個、長泰出鴻昌進英金鎊五十個、鼎元出永泰進英金票一百鎊、森泰出永泰進美金票二百元、惠通出鴻昌進英金鎊五十個、昨日市價、英金鎊降三角、英金票降五分、美金鎊二角、美金票降八厘、香港票降五厘、法郎票降七毫半、坎拿大票降三分、斐律濱票降二分、其他各幣俱無更動、</p>

<p>天津二十日電、匯兌行市與十八日比較、英匯放長〇六二五、美匯放長〇六二五、美匯放長一二五、申匯跌一元、茲將上午開盤市價列後、</p>

<p>香港二十日電、英美申匯兌行市上午開盤與上週六價同、十時四十分美匯縮〇六二五、價爲廿九元、申匯跌二角五分、價爲一八〇元、至下午二時卅分匯價均未有變動、茲將上午開盤市價列下、</p>
<p>英匯　一先令二辨士九〇六二五</p>
<p>美匯　廿九元〇六二五</p>
<p>申匯　一八〇二五</p>
<p>（申匯爲港紙百元合上海法幣之數）</p>
<p>證券　中歐多故　內債下降　比最高小去兩元半</p>
<p>證券暗盛、昨市因歐洲緊張局勢、一般浮而不實之多頭、紛紛出籠、故連日市價萎靡不振、與最高價相較、已跌去二元半以上、兩種已打破五十元關、如歐事稍有挽回之趨勢、市價或許有反動、</p>
<p>昨日經過、開盤十六號及天生樂茂等號賣出、買戶則爲貿大及同康、大戶生意不起、市價趨疲、午後十一及十六號以及協大號賣出、四號則始終買進、潤利及散戶亦有吸收、檯面仍覺供過於求、丙種乃打破五十元大關、午後再小四五角、結果比續小六角半至九角、成交數約五十萬元左右、茲列簡明表於後、</p>

<h3>五金　青鉛鐵現貨軋缺</h3>
<p>青鉛鐵向以本街廠家去路爲大宗、週來天津幫因匯兌合算、羣起狂辦、成交達千餘箱之多、價由四十二元升至四十五元、</p>
<h3>紗花　駭人聽聞之　單紗漲風</h3>
<p>三二支天女跳念元</p>
<p>紗市仍平、惟三二支細紗漲風劇烈、漲勢之鋒铓、爲市塲中所罕見、蓋以春夏季節關係、浙東湘贛一帶需要稍起、至於同業鑒於現貨缺乏、廠方工作錠子不多、於是拉抬尤烈、在市紛紛搜羅、因之市價互相高抬、三二支天女單紗狂跳二十元、價爲五百七十元、查四二支天女雙股綫價反爲五百四十五元、比單紗價要低落二十五元、其中情形、可想有人做作也、不過此種昂騰、未免太暴、據市塲言、廠方因二十支紗價平庸、大家都改紡單紗矣、將後一旦反動、亦不可不防也、且查上年三二支單紗頂高峯曾到五百七十元、屆時二十支紗價在四百八十元左右、照此狀況論之、紗廠改紡單紗、勢所必然矣、午後三二支天女單紗再漲三元、爲五百七十三元、比週六暴騰二十一元有奇、</p>
<p>現紗情形、晨初開盤、同業相聚紗市仍平淡、惟細紗三二支浙東方面採辦踴躍、市況因之緊張、三二支牧羊開價比上日漲六元、一霎間耍漲二十元、二十支紗價因單紗漲勢銳利、帶好一元、二十支雙馬價爲三百六十六元、棧單價爲三百九十二元半至三元、午後紗市略昂五角、惟單紗再漲三元、查全日各幫買去統計一千九百零五包、行情二十支紗雙馬漲二元、其餘亦漲一·二元不等、惟三二支·四二支細紗價漲五元至二十元、茲將各幫買去現紗之額量錄左、</p>

<p>出口棉紗昨運汕頭三百八十五件、香港二百八十五件、廣州灣一百七十五件、海防五百九十五件、今日運往汕頭八百二十件、香港七十件、福州五十件、</p>
<h3>埃及棉猛跌七元</h3>
<p>廠商尚在觀望本棉生意轉寂</p>
<p>外棉市價、海外棉價之跌落、早爲本報所觀及、昨日紐約之跌價受歐洲局勢嚴重之影響、然主要原因、實乃盛傳貸款棉之放出、及政府將採用輸棉出口津貼辦法之所致、各同業因之異常恐慌、各方紛紛賣出、棉價頗感疲乏、跌七至十三磅音、印度因利物浦之暴跌、及受美貸款棉放出之消息、連同預測猛跌達三羅比餘、埃及棉猛跌七十餘磅音、昨日匯兌略鬆、折合法幣、棉價計美棉及巴西每担跌一元一角、印棉每担跌一元三角半、埃及棉每担猛跌七元餘、</p>
<p>滬市外棉交易、各廠均並不因外棉價格之暴跌、面有採辦、各方對海外棉市尚擬作相當時期之觀望、然昨日細紗飛漲、天津細絨雖出善價、亦南購得、故料各廠日內均略將採購長纖維之外棉矣、茲將昨日外棉價格分錄於後、</p>

<p>本棉生意轉寂、實因價格太高、且美印棉布復見大跌、致採算價日趨廉宜、廠商當然舍貴取賤、本棉地位、大都被其侵奪、然本埠存棉不足以補充也、昨做開之市價、依然堅挺如恒、始終不鬆、蘇北一路來源仍尠、計通州細絨花五百五十五包、茲將現棉售開市盤並額量列左、</p>

<h3>不要再去貪便宜　老實改穿國布罷</h3>
<p>— 浮石</p>
<p>我在呢絨業爲職員，自學生意到現在，屈指快要三十年了。呢絨業的變遷，不知經過多少次數，簡單些說，正如前日本刋志峯先生說的「從史的方面來談上海呢絨業」所云。後來本刋又發表唐駿先生「呢絨業寗不自爲計」，使我非常感慨，即呢絨業中人見之，亦有同感，因之特來解剖一番，以明涇渭。</p>
<p>（一）自日方化身「聯銀」發行僞幣，圖攫奪法幣，換取外匯，當局不得已實施外匯統制，呢絨進口請求困難，十之九五，均向滙豐銀行購結，（按中央請求匯票每國幣一圓爲一先令二辦士半，滙豐購結，通常祗有八辦士半，）致成本突高三分之一有餘，（即未戰前到本每碼六元，現在須八元三五角，）貨價安得而不飛漲。且戰事初起，呢絨同業的定貨，爲求事業穩固計，其已定者謀解約，其已裝船者或延期或轉香港暫存。夢想不到去年孤島的商市，會畸形發達到如此地步，呢絨各貨，雖有訂定，但爲數有限，兼之遠水不能救近火，竟造成求過於供而鬧恐慌的局面，其時標準行情，猶如金子一般，一日三四次上漲，又言明一律現鈔，故去年大結束後，大小各鋪，莫不賺錢，這也不是呢絨一業爲然。何況去年不是呢絨業的盈餘，決不能如本報所載一般無二，多少是有出入的，我們只可拿他作槪念看。</p>
<p>（二）唐駿先生說：去年呢絨業的滿面春風者，出於鄰幫的恩賜，又云不分明敵我，這未免太過火了，此所謂祗知其一，不知其二。查同業中去年盈餘最多者爲拆貨幫，拆貨幫如美發聯興，義昌泰，升大，王興昌，裕昌祥等，完全無一寸敵貨進門，就是高等的服裝店，亦皆擯而不用。回　說吧，其偶有銷售者，一種是店方迎合主顧貪便宜的心理，只聽價錢，但看花樣，不問質地的好壞，貨物的經用，那自然是劣貨最合銷路了。如其要從嚴格地說，固可以說，不有賣，何來買，的是販賣的不是；但翻轉來說，如果大家不買便宜貨，販賣者無從出賣，亦不想販賣了，因之可說買賣雙方，厥羅惟均。</p>
<p>（三）另一方面，孤島上的人們，萬有不齊，見了人家賺錢容易，向來有身家牌面的店號，如某泰某祥，某豐某記，以及有名的掮客跑街，如呂夏張陳楊曹等二十餘人，一時利令智昏，就不問所推銷的含有花色，都拿鮮血殘肢來織造成的，因人類貪小利的弱點，爲仇者快而親者痛，發他們的大財，此我所以欽佩唐駿先生的結語，懇切地誠摯地希望同業中的能知道未來幸福者，迅速回頭，痛改前非，從整個民族與自身的前途打算一下，不要祗顧眼前利益，而不顧後日的險惡憂患，推開窗門講亮話，已有相當盈餘擁有資產，快快洗手，不要幹那出賣子孫幸福勾當了。可是呢絨業中一般小職員，一樣有碗苦飯吃了，倒是充滿了民族意識激發天良，不肯貪便宜，想發財，送錢與人，造槍砲來打我們的家鄉。</p>
<p>（四）我特向各界人士進一忠告，購剪或定製中西服裝呢絨，務請指明國產（國產呢絨，大半呢邊多有證明圖章），注意羊美人牌子，及永興宏康呢絨多是申地織製，而是某國人經營，店方稱爲本廠貨，總之勿貪便宜，以免受愚。誠如俗語說「貪賤買老牛，一年倒二頭，」茍爲經濟關係，買不起經久耐用的西洋呢絨，還不如老實改穿國布，最大方，最經濟，最耐用，人家見了不會扮鬼臉，還奉敬你一聲，眞是一位澈頭澈尾的青年愛國之士呢</p>
<h3>疋頭　甬匯突高　布疋採辦驟淡</h3>
<p>漂染各貨市盤挺秀大宗布疋昨今出口</p>
<p>國布漂染各貨、市盤挺秀、綸昌白地色丁白地克羅綢每疋均漲一角、夏令貨開盤、印花不退色蔴紗十四元四角、蔴紡十三元八角、本街門市店均已動辦、湘贛幫採辦色布漂布府綢殊旺、綜計四千餘疋、多數由溫州轉運、溫州幫添辦白貨富貴金鳳各牌細布一百餘件、府綢漂布漂斜、色布色斜二百餘箱、甬幫近以申匯　水突高至每千元二十三元、上海去貨成本抬高、頗不利走銷、故進胃驟淡、祗配購零星件額細布細斜府綢等貨一百餘件、粵幫採辦色斜較旺、成交一百七八十箱、白貨辦細斜細布一百餘件、白貨售盤獨細布細斜微堅五分、粗布價仍平定、</p>
<p>東疋白貨因染銷續盛、售盤堅挺、昨細布細斜由本街色布字號及各染廠所添辦者、又達千件左右、津幫亦進細布四百餘件、內彩球細布一牌、獨辦二百件、故同業人心一致看高、日信洋行開出本月份及下月份細布三百數十件、龍頭價每疋十二元一角半、陽鶴爲十二元二角、東棉洋行開出雙魚細斜及藍雞細布二百數十包、雙魚斜爲十一元五角、藍雞布每疋爲十二元、</p>
<p>昨日疋頭出口、二百件運汕頭、五百件運廣州灣、四百六十五件運海防、又今日有二千四百件運天津、五百四十件運烟台、一百十件運福州、七百四十件運汕頭、二十五件運香港、</p>
<h3>無印貨靠不住　有印貨遂盛行</h3>
<p>呢邊有西文字之呢羢、近日風行更甚、前之祗限於西裝套頭者、今日盛行之於華服衣料矣、遍觀霞飛路四川路大新街靜安寺路南京路河南路一帶之服裝店、呢絨號綢緞局等、幾無一家不銷售有字呢羢、就四萬二千號花呢爲例、同一質地、無字每碼批八元、有字即須八元五角矣、而銷路反較無字者爲暢、以其易於辨明、足見人心不用劣貨之決心矣、</p>
<h3>糧食　麵粉北運居多</h3>
<p>粉市廠盤小五分期洋麥成交一船</p>
<p>麵粉市況、已轉疲跌、不獨整銷即零星亦不似前兩日之活潑、據聞南洋幫泉州等處、因某方有企圖晉江而上之舉、船隻進出不便、故需要並不濃厚、北洋幫亦受洋粉影響、實銷難期開展、結果減價五分、始引起本客之貪取、計開二三四號各牌粉約四五萬包、二號粉本客一律四元六角半、三號粉四元六角、四號粉四元三角、五號白袋三元八角至六角不等、</p>
<p>昨日麵粉運往汕頭四千五百包、今日運往天津一萬八千包、烟臺七千包、威海衛五千包、福州八千包、又麩皮七百包運往香港、</p>
<p>小麥市塲、停滯如故、偶有零星到貨、均被日廠收去、或者直接送廠作價、槪無正式市面、惟洋粉麥競銷聲中、期貨迭有成交、昨聞本街方面、新定澳麥一船計七千噸、價祗七元七角八分、至外傳粉廠續定洋麥二船之說、亦可證實、</p>
<h3>河下米價已回　洋元米聞有定貨</h3>
<p>昨日各幫來源河下共到十號、車運來包子二千餘包、早市開手尚有餘波、續見緊俏、若厚薄粳價有加角許、晚市囤戶停手、本街銷塲亦懈、形勢遂轉疲色、杜洋尖及埠尖變元等、供求相仿、無所榮辱、</p>
<p>客秈本客零囤納胃均濃、而蕪湖產地價昂、故晨間價立漲一二角、旋有大戶客囤獲利脫出、後市立見回降、結果祗較好數分而已、</p>
<p>洋米現貨站定十七元二角、出入兩乏、市面當可站立一下、惟自本客元米飛漲以後、行情易漲難小、久站於十九元左右之高價、故昨聞糧商已購訂香港洋元米及糯米菉共計四百噸、據說可在週內爲申、二十日由香港運來一千六百五十包、</p>
<h3>絲茶　日絲漲跌倐忽　滬絲交易寥寥</h3>
<p>昨日絲市、橫濱再跌、現貨一〇三五元、較週末跌十元、遠期九六八元、較週六跌二十一元、可見東市之漲跌倐忽、全由操縱投機所致、故其漲也未能久持、其跌也漫無標準、所惜者本埠絲市、未能抓持此種機會、加以利用、推動外銷耳、致今次橫濱（本月十七日十八日）絲市之一度漲跌、本埠鮮有反應、唯有坐視而已、昨日紐約無市、預測絲價、似亦將下落、此在邇來遠期絲價漲風較疲、下跌時較劇中、可鑒其一般、且自歐洲情勢突呈緊張以來、歐美綢銷都不無影響、而間接則捺低了絲價的上升、</p>
<p>本埠絲市、交易寥寥、洋行吃價、白廠B七八勻度發電一七三〇元尚難成交、用戶方面進胃亦多猶豫、大致人心觀望、暫不進出、故乾　市價亦相當回小、計土種討價現爲三一〇元、洋種四一〇元、邇來以鮮吃戶、昨祗印莊做開輯里經五担云、</p>

<h3>關於現鈔買賣　交貨問題的內幕</h3>
<p>— 龍駒生</p>
<p>俗語說：「戲法人人會變，各有巧妙不同。」工商業中的生意經，波譎雲詭，亦猶如此。何況現在「天之驕子」的紗業，現紗買賣的縱橫椑闔！好像金「貴重若金」！光陣裏的「諸葛八陣圖」了！</p>
<p>筆者于紗業界十餘年，深悉個中巧妙，因一述「關於現紗買賣，交貨問題的內幕」，倘亦爲從事斯業和關心斯業者所樂聞乎！</p>
<p>（一）棧單貨</p>
<p>棧單貨的價格，要比現貨（也就是所謂門票貨）別低二，三，元不等，甚至竟相差十元左右（每件），雖然客戶一樣要墊款，可是有的是七成現鈔，三成匯劃，可是有的是七成現鈔，三成匯劃，有的却七成匯劃，三成現鈔，現鈔成數多的（或者完全是現鈔），價格方面，可以比較便宜些，反之，同樣是一張棧單貨，售價就要提高了！因爲貼現之故。廠方對於棧單貨的待遇，有兩種，（甲）客家（紗號）拋進某貨時，行市還是便宜額子的話，則須與高價貨扯出。（乙）客家不在一星期內墊款出貨者，即將額子取銷，或另派給他家。（丙）客家定紡而延（或二，三日間）不墊款換棧單者，卽將定銀沒收。總之，棧單貨，無一定換得現貨的把握。（除非加價換門票貨，又調之抽現），所以市塲中買賣「棧單貨」，在市面飛俏的時候，是大家不甚歡迎的。</p>
<p>（二）門票貨</p>
<p>是已將棧單，換得廠方門票（出貨立付的棧房憑證），可以隨時出貨，也謂之「抽現」，售價高出棧單貨五六元至十元不等，會鑽營而能走廠方門路的，往往預看到行市有突飛猛晋的趨勢，於是大買棧單貨，向廠方再繳相當「抽現費」即能換取門票出到現貨，而乘機操奇計盈矣。（按門票貨也須換門票No.派貨）</p>
<p>（三）新老棧單</p>
<p>所以新老棧單，是塡給棧單時間的先後問題，並非如A君所述「未墊銀」與「已墊銀」之謂。蓋旣已取得廠方棧單，必先已墊款，茍未付墊款，決不能取得棧單，廠方買賣的慣例，是「收款而後塡單（棧單）」的，較他業交易，比較硬繃繃，毫無「先單後銀」的通融的。「老棧單」固然可以儘先要求派貨，但是價格較廉買進的，依然會派貨落後；反之，「新棧單」價格較高，也一樣可以提前派給的。</p>
<p>（四）批單</p>
<p>「批單」就是客方與廠方有「特別情感」的話，廠方營業部部長或主任經理之允許，得批註棧單上加蓋印章，飭令廠方憑批註及簽章提前派給，其他客家往往聞訊交涉吵鬧，則因廠方之權，高於一切，客家亦是無可奈何的事。</p>
<p>至於A君所說：「門票交貨，如市上無人接收，出貨者自己非轉棧不可，多耗上棧費及車力等……」也未必盡然，蓋出到「門票現貨」必已先有受主，或款到裝輪運出，照戰前的情形，即將輪運提單及保險單向銀行做押匯，以抵銷甲乙兩地債權與債務的雙方清訖的，故「門票交貨」並不一定是無受主。若就投機者的囤戶而論，自然勢非上棧不可也。囤戶上棧後，即可憑棧單向金融機關轉做押款，移押款資金，再搜購棉紗，待善價而沽，無異拿一副資本，派兩副用塲，如果機會巧，市價高，即行脫手，除棧租及押款利息外，獲利倍蓰，善於活動的，有手腕的棉紗商人，誠可一舉手一投足之間，便立可鉅富。所謂「長袖善舞多財善賈」，內幕的離奇變幻，出神入化，眞乃「戲法人人會變各有巧妙不同」呢！</p>

<h3>Significant Shift in the European Situation: Britain in Contact with Six Nations to Encircle Germany</h3>
<p>Also Undertaking Preparations on All Fronts; Soviet Union Initiates the Convening of an International Conference</p>
<p>(London) Reuters reports that the British government, regarding the major situation in Central Europe, will soon exchange telegrams and opinions with the governments of the Soviet Union, Poland, Romania, Yugoslavia, Turkey, and Bulgaria. Simultaneously, all parties are currently undertaking all preparations. This morning at 10:30, the Cabinet held a full meeting, which adjourned at 12:15. The report from Sir Nevile Henderson, the British Ambassador to Germany, and his opinions to be presented to Parliament this afternoon, were both submitted to the Cabinet for review. While the meeting was in progress, the three opposition leaders, Attlee, Greenwood, and Sinclair, visited 10 Downing Street to inquire about the latest developments in the situation. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>(London) Although today is Sunday, political activity has not ceased. Sir Nevile Henderson, the British Ambassador to Germany, returned from Berlin at 3:30 PM and immediately met with Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax for three-quarters of an hour. It is reported that he presented a pessimistic report on the situation in Germany and the intentions of the German government. The Cabinet held a small group meeting at the Prime Minister's residence, attended by Prime Minister Chamberlain, Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax, Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir John Simon, First Lord of the Admiralty Earl Stanhope, Lord Chancellor Sir Inskip, Minister for Coordination of Defence Lord Chatfield, First Lord of the Admiralty, President of the Board of Trade Stanley, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Cadogan, and Government Industrial Advisor Sir Wilson. It is reported that the discussions focused on two key aspects: intensifying military expansion and collectively resisting Germany's expansionist policy. They also considered holding a conference of Britain, the United States, France, the Soviet Union, Romania, Yugoslavia, Greece, and Turkey to formulate a common policy to address new aggressions. It is also reported that Foreign Secretary Halifax and President of the Board of Trade Stanley meticulously studied whether economic sanctions could be imposed on Germany. King George VI returned to London at 5:00 PM, and Prime Minister Chamberlain immediately entered the palace at 6:00 PM for an audience, where he reported on the international situation. He did not leave until 7:00 PM. Soviet Ambassador Maisky visited Foreign Secretary Halifax before the small group meeting of the Cabinet, delivering a copy of the Soviet note to Germany and informing him that although the Soviet Union was disappointed after the Munich Agreement, it was still prepared to participate in collective action to prevent Germany from expanding its power. Regarding this, London political circles say that the British government has now decided to approach the Soviet Union and wants to unite the countries of Northeast and Southeast Europe to form a defensive line to resist Germany. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) The Cabinet decided yesterday that Britain should immediately contact all peace-loving countries in the world to respond to the situation, and decided to accelerate the completion of Britain's military expansion plan with maximum effort, and scheduled to hold another meeting this morning. At the same time, Britain and France are preparing everything so that they will not be caught off guard if Germany takes further action. Non-official circles advocate that Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union hold a conference to formulate a grand strategy, and invite the Balkan countries to join. It is reported that when British Foreign Secretary Halifax received Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky today, he discussed the possibility of cooperation between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union for half an hour. Prime Minister Chamberlain was quite busy today, receiving Foreign Secretary Halifax, Secretary of State for Air Wood, and Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs Inskip in the morning. In the afternoon, he again received Halifax and President of the Board of Trade Stanley. At 5:50 PM, he drove to Buckingham Palace to meet with the King, where he reported on the latest developments in the European situation for more than an hour before returning to his residence. Chamberlain also held a meeting with cabinet members related to national defense today.</p>
<p>(London) After the Cabinet holds another meeting this morning, an announcement will be made in both the House of Lords and the House of Commons in the afternoon. People across the country expect that British foreign policy will change. The Times stated that in Europe today, only force is valued, and everything else is insufficient. Britain has never approved of the policy of encircling Germany, but Germany's own policies have now made encirclement a natural and inevitable method. This statement can largely represent British public opinion. The Daily Telegraph stated that the policy that Britain will adopt will inevitably require Britain to assume new obligations elsewhere. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>(London) Opposition leader Attlee asked the Prime Minister in the House of Commons today to express his opinion on the European situation. Prime Minister Chamberlain replied that his speech in Birmingham on March 17 had expressed the government's serious views on the events of the past week. The European situation is currently receiving the government's urgent attention. The British government is now exchanging information with other governments, and he will make a more detailed statement in the House of Commons at the earliest possible opportunity.

<h3>British Chancellor Meets with U.S. Ambassador; U.S. Treasury Secretary Meets with British and French Counselors</h3>
<p>British Overseas Trade Minister Visits Polish Foreign Minister and Sends Commercial Representatives to Romania</p>
<p>(London) U.S. Ambassador Kennedy visited Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon this afternoon for consultations. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Treasury Secretary Morgenthau recently held a meeting with the financial counselors of the British and French embassies. Another meeting is scheduled for today. Political circles here are commenting that the U.S. government hopes that the three major democratic countries of Britain, France, and the United States will act in unison, and this move can be seen as maximizing this. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>Warsaw British Overseas Trade Minister Hudson has come here for a visit and will meet with Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck tomorrow morning. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>(London) President of the Board of Trade Stanley announced that the government has decided to send a commercial delegation to Romania. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>Warsaw British Overseas Trade Minister Hudson, accompanied by members Hill, Director of the Economic Department of the Foreign Office Ward King, and four experts, arrived here at 4:30 PM today. Polish Vice Minister of Industry and Commerce Rose and British Ambassador Sir Kennard welcomed them at the station. In addition to holding talks with Polish Minister of Industry and Commerce Roman and Finance Minister General Kwiatkowski, Hudson will also meet with Foreign Minister Colonel Beck. The political significance of this trip is self-evident. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) The Soviet Union has proposed convening a conference of peace-loving countries. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>(London) Officials here have stated that it is unbelievable that Foreign Secretary Halifax proposed a treaty of alliance to Soviet Ambassador Maisky yesterday. So far, the two countries have only exchanged views on the issue of strengthening cooperation. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax held talks with Soviet Ambassador Maisky this afternoon. Responsible individuals have stated that the Foreign Secretary has formally proposed that Britain is willing to work with the Soviet Union. Ambassador Maisky immediately replied that he personally believes that the Soviet government will support any proposals made by democratic countries to establish a collective security system. It is generally believed that the Soviet government will soon submit a formal answer. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<h3>Hitler Returns to Berlin: Enthusiastic Welcome</h3>
<p>Göring Says the German Nation Vows Never to Give Up Bloody Loot</p>
<p>Berlin Hitler returned here by train at 6:30 this afternoon. At that time, the cheers and military horns in the station were deafening. General Göring, along with the entire cabinet, senior administrative officials, leaders of the National Socialist Party from various districts, and military party delegations, stood on the platform to welcome him. Inside and outside the station, swastika flags were hung everywhere. The roads that Hitler passed after leaving the station were crowded with people, and the scene was rare. Göring gave a speech welcoming Hitler, saying that the Führer not only restored the past glory of the German nation but also placed Germany on a solid foundation. This is a day for the Führer to be proud of. Now, in the name of the German nation, he solemnly swore that he would never give up the great achievements he had won. He could not express his gratitude to the Führer in any other way. Such a heroic soldier would never be without a heroic nation behind him. The Führer has made this nation courageous and great. After Göring finished speaking, the crowd saluted Hitler, who then left the station and returned to the Chancellery by car. The crowds along the way stood like walls, cheering loudly. Every few distances, there was a military band stationed. From the station to the Chancellery, there were as many as 50 military bands stationed. The searchlights of the Chancellery shone brightly, as bright as day. Hitler's car drove very slowly. After entering the Chancellery, the crowd gathered in front of the door cheered and asked him to come to the balcony. Hitler appeared three times, and the last time he declared that he could not come out again because he had to have important talks. At that time, the crowd on Wilhelmstrasse was in a frenzy and broke through the cordon of the party army three times. The leaders of the German churches ordered all churches to ring their bells from 6:45 PM to 7:00 PM. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<h3>Göring to Visit Italy Again Today</h3>
<p>(Berlin) It is reported that General Göring will visit Italy again tomorrow to continue his interrupted vacation. This indicates that the German Reichstag will not be convened for a while. It is believed that General Göring will meet with Mussolini. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<h3>Anglo-German Naval Agreement: Germany Also to Abolish</h3>
<p>(London) News revealed by political figures in Berlin said that Germany would abolish the Anglo-German Naval Agreement. All newspapers here published it this morning, but did not comment. Only the News Chronicle published a short comment saying that if Germany implements this move, it will inevitably restore the state of Anglo-German naval arms race planned by Tirpitz before the war. (Haitong, 20th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Since Britain's attitude towards Germany has become firm, German newspapers have criticized Britain more and more fiercely, even without avoiding threats, and openly advocated abolishing the Anglo-German Naval Treaty of 1935. According to this treaty, the total tonnage of the German Navy shall not exceed 35% of the total tonnage of the British Navy. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<h3>Gibraltar: Naval Defense Strengthened</h3>
<p>(London) The 33,000-ton battleship "Repulse" has sailed from the British mainland to the port of Gibraltar. According to official explanations, when King George VI inspects the Canadian Federation in May of this year, he will use the "Repulse" as his flagship for the first trial voyage. However, after this ship arrives in the port of Gibraltar, the strength of the British Mediterranean Fleet will greatly increase. This is an obvious fact. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>Gibraltar Officials here issued a notice today recruiting British people to join the local air defense team. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<h3>Czechs Rise Up: Begin to Resist Germany</h3>
<p>Increasing Suicides and Thousands Arrested; Beneš Announces Fight for Independence</p>
<p>Prague It is reported that the number of people arrested and suicides here is increasing. Czech police, under the direction of the German secret police, have arrested thousands of residents, most of whom are German refugees from Austria and the Sudetenland, political figures, and journalists. The president of the Polish News Agency is also among those arrested. The Polish ambassador to Berlin has already intervened. No Jews have been reported arrested so far. According to the Czech News Agency, a bomb was thrown into the residence of the German leader in the Těšín area, about 35 miles outside Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia. No injuries were reported. A German was also thrown a bomb in the street, but was not injured. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>Chicago It was rumored that Dr. Edvard Beneš, the former President of Czechoslovakia, intended to organize a temporary government within the United States. Dr. Beneš himself has denied this. He stated that it was too early to say so. He then gave a radio address, saying, "Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia is a crime and will undoubtedly be punished by God in the future. If this kind of crime is not punished, there will be no peace and order in the world. In fact, war has already broken out in Europe. The humanitarian values of Britain, France, Scandinavia, and the Balkan Peninsula have been threatened, as have those of other countries around the world." He concluded by saying, "I vow to fight to the end for the independence of Czechoslovakia." (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>(New York) Well-informed Czech sources here have stated that Dr. Edvard Beneš, the former President of Czechoslovakia, intends to establish a temporary government within the United States, which is expected to be recognized by the United States and major democratic countries in Europe. Czech consuls in various parts of the United States and dignitaries residing in the United States are willing to support this move. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) The Daily Herald recently reported that "After Germany annexed Czechoslovakia, the British government has ordered that all cash and securities deposited by Czechs in British banks be prohibited from being transferred. At the same time, the U.S. government has also taken the same measures, totaling £65 million. From this estimate, the overseas funds that Germany has seized from the Czechs should not exceed £35 million." (Havas, 20th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The United States Holds the Most Powerful Weapon</h3>
<p>The rampages of fascist aggressors have created an atmosphere of international chaos and unease, but at the same time, they have also spurred the gradual awakening of peaceful democratic countries. Ever since Hitler annihilated Czechoslovakia in three days with lightning speed, even Chamberlain, who had been working himself to the bone to compromise, felt the urgency of the fascist threat and had a tendency to try to get closer to the United States and the Soviet Union to jointly resist Germany. Of course, it is too early to say that the ruling classes of Britain and France will abandon their consistent policy of "appeasement" today and adopt a firm anti-aggression stance; however, the growing cohesion and firmness of the peace front under the serious threat of fascism is an undeniable fact. In recent days, we have seen the efforts of small countries in Southeast Europe to "precariously seek self-preservation," and we have long seen the active activities of diplomats in London. But equally worthy of our attention is that the United States, which has a very active anti-aggression attitude, is using calm labor to promote the unity and consolidation of the peace front. After Hitler's military invasion of Czechoslovakia, U.S. Under Secretary of State Welles first issued a statement condemning Germany's illegal actions, and then President Roosevelt also told reporters that he would soon propose amending the Neutrality Act "to curb the tide of aggression." At the same time, the U.S. government also declared that, in retaliation for Germany's aggression in Europe and its economic penetration into the Western Hemisphere, the U.S. government had decided to implement a "punitive tax" on German imports. Congress expects the government to use this means of sanction against Japan and other countries that violate the treaty. The increasingly active anti-aggression attitude of the United States is enough to promote the development of the peace front; if the United States can earnestly apply economic pressure to fascist countries, it will be enough to make fascist countries tremble with fear, and even lead to their demise.</p>
<p>The United States holds the most powerful economic weapon, and she can indeed "use methods other than war" to make it impossible for aggressors to invade. For example, according to Janeway's estimate, the United States can produce 72 million tons of steel each year, while the combined output of all countries in the world other than the United States is less than 76 million tons. If the United States unites with all democratic countries, whether this force can be compared with the fascist group that "started by extortion" can be understood by looking at the point mentioned above. Since "extortion" has developed into a political weapon, world trade has also been restricted by "autarky." Europe is the United States' largest buyer, but now it is not buying food and commercial raw materials. The deepening crisis of American agriculture is precisely the result of this. Now, what Europe and Asia need most are machinery and military raw materials, and the United States is constantly exporting them, helping the fascists turn the people into cannon fodder.</p>
<p>The current policy of the United States is indeed too helpful to the fascists. Former U.S. Secretary of State Stimson has tried his best to oppose it. The famous reporter Janeway even loudly exclaimed that "The war in China is our baby!" True, without the supply of the United States, Japan would simply be unable to invade China. More than 90% of the oil and copper used by Japan is supplied by the United States. Secondly, Japan also purchases a large number of machines from the United States. Japan itself cannot manufacture machines. Nor can she get them from her Berlin ally. In 1937, her imports of machinery from Germany were six times that of the United States, but in 1938, Germany refused to sell to Japan because it was not enough for its own use. Now, 75% of the machines used by Japan are imported from the United States.</p>
<p>The same is true for Germany. Another American reporter, Voggen, wrote an article entitled "We Built the Nazi Air Force," pointing out that the establishment of Germany's air force today relies almost entirely on the supply of the United States for raw materials. The oil produced in Germany can only meet half of its needs, and the quality is not good. In order to improve the quality of the oil, she is purchasing the best oil refining machines from the United States. It is no wonder that Janeway said: "If Hitler succeeds in invading Europe, the United States will be responsible."</p>
<p>From the brief description above, it can be seen how deeply the fascist aggressor countries rely on the United States economically. Without the material support of the United States, the machine of aggression cannot be started. The United States really holds the most powerful weapon to control the aggressor countries.</p>
<p>At present, the situation of the aggressors' challenge is expanding, and the United States, in view of the seriousness of the threats it faces, is increasingly actively calling on the world's peaceful forces to fight against aggression. This is certainly gratifying, but it is not enough. We hope that the wise President Roosevelt can lead his people to further take out the most powerful economic weapons, unite with democratic countries such as Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, and jointly give the fascist aggressors a fatal blow.</p>
<h3>U.S. Senate to Discuss Amendment to Neutrality Act Today; Public Opinion Unanimously Believes It Can Be Passed and Economic Sanctions Will Be Imposed on Japan</h3>
<p>(Washington) According to a senior official who told the Associated Press today, after the domestic public has clearly expressed its policy towards Germany, the United States may impose trade sanctions on Japan, the scope of which may be broader than those against Germany, because Japan's discrimination against the United States is indirectly even worse than Germany's discrimination against the United States. Germany directly subsidizes exports to the United States, while Japan does not directly subsidize exports to the United States, but there is extreme discrimination against American goods in "Manchukuo" and North China. In a note from the U.S. State Department to the Japanese government on October 6 last year, the discrimination against U.S. trade by Japan in "Manchukuo" and North China was specifically listed. Japan has not yet responded to this note. The U.S. tariff bill authorizes the president to act conveniently when a foreign country directly or indirectly discriminates against the commercial interests of the United States. (Associated Press, 19th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman is scheduled to submit a new Neutrality Act to Congress today, advocating that the president be authorized to designate belligerent countries within 30 days after the outbreak of war and extend the "cash and carry" clause to all kinds of goods (including munitions). He gave a radio address last night, explaining the contents of this bill, saying, "If the totalitarian countries continue to expand, the whole world will encounter a critical situation, and the United States will be no exception. Our country must take action to prepare for the worst. The purpose of the new Neutrality Act that I have proposed is not to expand the president's privileges. The policy pursued by the United States focuses on maintaining existing treaties and respecting promises. Looking around the world, the only major countries that can support this policy are Britain and France." (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Political figures here are commenting on the new Neutrality Act proposed by Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman, saying that this new Neutrality Act intends to extend the "cash and carry" clause in the current Neutrality Act from all kinds of goods to munitions, and the impact may be beneficial to Japan, which is not necessarily the case, because the international situation is so serious that the goal of the new Neutrality Act is to provide only the best quality military supplies and food to Britain and France in the event of a war in Europe. Therefore, although its purpose is not to give Japan any convenience, because Japan is one of the world's great naval powers and has a large number of merchant ships, it can make full use of it to purchase only the best quality munitions and raw materials from the United States. Although this is not in line with the spirit of the new Neutrality Act, it may be temporarily accommodated because there is no way to have both. It is expected that when this new Neutrality Act is submitted to the Senate for discussion tomorrow afternoon, there will be no major disagreements among the senators, but Senator Johnson, a Republican from California, Senator Nye, a Republican from North Dakota (who wants to prohibit the transport of munitions to foreign countries in both peacetime and wartime), and Senator Reynolds, a Democrat from North Carolina, may speak out in opposition, while Senator Vandenberg, a Republican from Michigan, and Senator Clark, a Democrat from Missouri, will defend it. As for President Roosevelt, he has already clearly expressed his approval of this bill, and his views on the European situation are supported by most senators. In addition, there is one more thing that is very important, that is, Senate Republican Leader Taft recently gave a speech saying, "I approve of a large-scale military expansion plan, especially the training of a strong air force, so that the United States can cope with all incidents in this turbulent international situation." Therefore, it can be inferred that this new Neutrality Act will be passed by the Senate. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The Chinese branch of the International Anti-Aggression League recently received a U.S. news report, which stated that American citizens attitude towards amending the Neutrality Act. Religious organizations such as the United World Church Friendship Alliance and seven other groups, women's organizations such as the Association of University Women and seven other groups, labor organizations such as the Ironworkers Committee and twelve other groups, and five peace organizations such as the Association for Cooperation in Promoting Peace have all resolved to advocate amending the Neutrality Act, and it is necessary to distinguish between aggressor countries and victims of aggression, and the embargo on munitions and raw materials should be applied to aggressor countries. When Professor Shotwell from Columbia University gave a lecture at Carnegie Hall in New York, he criticized the Neutrality Act, saying, "This bill not only fails to distinguish between aggressors and victims of aggression, but also helps the wicked and harms friendly countries." Bishop Oldham of Albany also believed at a lecture organized by the Association for Cooperation in Promoting Peace that "the Neutrality Act is the result of the confusion or suspicion and fear of the old political leaders of the United States. In this world where all parts are closely related, mentioning isolation is suspected of dishonesty." (20th)</p>
<h3>Arita and Saionji Discuss Important Issues</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Kokumin Shimbun reported today that Foreign Minister Arita, acting on the orders of Prime Minister Hiranuma, visited elder statesman Saionji yesterday morning to present important foreign policy issues and seek the elder's opinion. After the meeting, he returned to Tokyo and immediately met with War Minister Itagaki to report on the results of his conversation with Saionji. Observers generally regard Arita's visit as extremely important, as it is rare for the Foreign Minister to visit an elder statesman. It is believed that the Cabinet is hesitant to make a decision on a certain special issue and therefore seeks the elder's opinion. The "special issue" likely concerns the dispute over Japanese-Soviet fishing rights or the strengthening of the Anti-Comintern Pact. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today, a foreign correspondent asked the Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman about rumors of a military alliance between Japan, Germany, and Italy. The spokesman replied that he could not comment on such rumors. The Diet has been discussing the need to strengthen the Anti-Comintern Pact. When asked whether the national sentiment in Japan in favor of strengthening relations with Germany and Italy had already led to a military alliance, and whether he could deny or confirm the rumors of a military alliance between the three countries, the spokesman replied that it was not a question of denying or confirming. He pointed out that Japan's attitude toward the Anti-Comintern Pact had been clearly stated and remained unchanged. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today, a foreign correspondent asked the Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman whether the situation in Europe would have any repercussions in East Asia. The spokesman replied that it was too early to make any predictions. The correspondent also asked, given rumors that the Communists had established a base of operations in Romania, whether Japan, as a signatory to the Anti-Comintern Pact, would assist Germany should it initiate action against the Communists in Romania. The spokesman replied that Japan would cooperate with Germany in anti-communist actions, but that it was still doubtful whether the situation would develop as the correspondent suggested.

<h3>Japan: Currency Inflation</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Ms. Atlee, a famous British journalist and editor of the "Far East Dispatch," stated in its fourth issue: The number of banknotes issued by the Bank of Japan was originally limited to 120 million yen, but after the invasion of China, it increased to 1 billion yen. Recently, it has become uncontrollable, reaching a staggering 2.2 billion, 1 million yen. Furthermore, the ambitious military leaders are requesting the Diet to increase the issuance to 2.7 billion, 1 million yen. At the same time, gold reserves have decreased significantly (falling by 200 million yen). There is a constant need to transport huge amounts of exports to maintain the credit of public bonds. The approaching collapse of Japanese finances reinforces the belief of the Chinese that, even with slightly inferior armaments, resistance to the end will ultimately lead to victory.

<h3>Hungary Mobilizes, Romania Deploys Defenses, Poland Intends to Mediate, German-Romanian Economic Talks May Succeed</h3>
<p>Capital of Hungary: The Hungarian government is continuing to mobilize its army in an orderly manner. It is expected that the entire mobilization will be completed by the 28th of this month. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>Capital of Hungary: Although the entire region of Carpatho-Ukraine has been occupied by Hungarian troops, trains fully loaded with troops are still departing for the region. A train leaves every three hours. Not only is the Hungarian capital bustling with activity, but so is the area along the border between Hungary and former Czechoslovakia. Young men conscripted into the army are now entering camps for service. Villagers are using mules and carts to transport hay and straw to the camps. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>Capital of Romania: Romanian troops are rapidly advancing towards the Carpatho-Ukraine and Hungarian borders. The main northwestern roads are blocked by troops. Although officials claim that a general mobilization order has not been issued, a large number of young men have indeed been conscripted, numbering between 90,000 and 100,000. This is due to the tense general situation and rumors that German troops are advancing through Czechoslovakia toward Carpatho-Ukraine, which necessitates vigilance. If this rumor is true, then German troops would be stationed on the Romanian border. However, the atmosphere in Romania is now more relaxed. It is reported that the government's talks with the German economic delegation are expected to lead to an agreement on Tuesday, which will be far less severe than the rumored German economic demands. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>Capital of Romania: It is reported that both Romania and Hungary have conscripted new soldiers and are deploying heavy forces to Carpatho-Ukraine.

<h3>Nordic Countries Seek Neutrality</h3>
<p>Capital of Norway: After members of the British Parliament recently issued a statement saying that Britain deeply desires to guarantee the independence of the Scandinavian Peninsula countries and other small countries, Norwegian Parliament Speaker Hambro commented on it at a political gathering last night, saying, "We appreciate the sympathy of other countries for the Nordic countries, but we have neither requested guarantees nor do we hope that any one country or any number of countries will guarantee our country's security in any form." "I personally have never believed in promises of security. Every country can only maintain its security by relying on its own strength and by helping Europe promote the concept of security."

<h3>German Troops Request Passage Through Hungary</h3>
<p>Capital of Hungary: It is reported that Hungary, Germany, and Romania are currently conducting separate, important negotiations. This is due to a request from the German side to the Hungarian government to allow German troops to pass through its territory in the event of war. Opinions within the Hungarian government are divided on this matter, falling into two factions: one faction advocates accepting Germany's request, while the other advocates forming an agreement with Romania, so that Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck's "European Third Axis" can be realized.

(Havas, 20th)</p>
<h3>American Public Opinion is Outraged</h3>
<p>(New York) After Germany annexed Czechoslovakia, the outrage of the American people is comparable to that of 1914 when Germany violated Belgian neutrality. Therefore, sympathy for the British, French, and Czech people is evident in various public places. Previously, when newsreels were shown in movie theaters, the audience would boo every time British Prime Minister Chamberlain appeared on the screen. However, since Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a speech in Birmingham condemning Germany's actions a few days ago, the boos have been replaced by applause. Most movie theaters are also showing newsreels from around the Munich Conference in September, which give the audience a deep sense of recollection. In this newsreel, former Czech President Beneš inspects the air force in front of the Hradčany Palace (i.e., the presidential palace). These air force personnel at the time thought that they would soon be going to the border to defend against foreign invasion. American audiences were greatly moved by this scene. When German troops were seen parading in formation with a "goose step" in the Sudetenland, the audience shouted loudly to express their opposition. The depth of American public opinion's aversion to Germany can be seen from this. (Havas, 20th)</p>

In addition to railways, highways are also under vigorous construction. Since the outbreak of the war of resistance against Japan, 1,990 miles of southwest highways have been completed, one is the Yunnan-Burma line, and the other is the Gansu-Xinjiang line. The former is 725 miles long, from Kunming to Lashio in Burma, and the latter is 1,540 miles long, from Lanzhou in Gansu to Dihua in Xinjiang. As for the original highway from Dihua to Yili, this line can directly reach the Soviet Union after completion. Since the outbreak of the Chinese War of Resistance, there have been 5,000 trucks imported from abroad. Currently, the average daily cargo transported on the Kunming-Yibin line is about 100 tons. In terms of waterways, efforts have also been made to ensure smooth flow in the past three months. The current plan of the Ministry of Communications is to open up the transportation between the Xiangjiang River and the Guijiang River. According to Xiang and Gui, the two rivers were originally connected, and they can be opened up by slightly dredging them. Once this road is opened, it is possible to sail directly from Hunan to Guangdong, because the Guijiang River and the Xijiang River in Guangdong are connected. (20th Associated Press)</p>

<h3>Most Guangzhou Citizens are Unemployed</h3>
<p>(Guangzhou) The "authorities" here believe that the unemployment problem is also related to the current prevalence of theft, so they have begun to find solutions. According to semi-official statistics, at least two-thirds of the city's population of 700,000 to 800,000 are unemployed. It is incomprehensible how they survive. Among those who are fortunate enough to find employment, most are employed by the Japanese army to engage in the restoration of urban construction projects. It is now heard that a large-scale company jointly operated by China and Japan will soon be organized, and it is planned to set up several factories, which can accommodate about thousands of unemployed people.

<h3>Hong Kong's Trade with South China Declines Sharply</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to statistics released by the official sector today, Hong Kong's exports to South China in February decreased significantly, reaching only 10% of the same period last year. Hong Kong's exports to South China last month were only 738,862 Hong Kong dollars, while in February 1938, they were as high as 7,857,939 Hong Kong dollars. Also, Hong Kong's exports to South China in the first two months of 1938 were 18,366,904 Hong Kong dollars, while in the first two months of this year, they were only 3,067,693 Hong Kong dollars. As for Hong Kong's imports from South China, they also declined sharply. Last month, Hong Kong imported goods worth 4,841,778 Hong Kong dollars from South China, while in February of last year, they were 7,443,673 Hong Kong dollars. According to the imports and exports of Hong Kong and South China in the first two months of 1939, Hong Kong had a deficit of 25,808,358 Hong Kong dollars. However, if the Japanese blockade continues in the future, the deficit of Hong Kong's trade with South China will exceed 200 million Hong Kong dollars. (20th Associated Press dispatch)</p>

<h3>Soviet Russia Does Not Recognize Germany's Annexation of Czechoslovakia, Listing Six Reasons</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The German Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Schulenburg, on the 16th, upon orders from his government, notified the Soviet government that Germany had concluded a so-called agreement on the 14th, placing the Czech people under German national protection. The next day, the ambassador sent a note to the Soviet government, notifying them of the contents of the German head of state's order to establish a protectorate in Bohemia and Moravia.</p>
<p>Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov sent the following reply to the ambassador, stating,</p>
<p>"Your Excellency's notes of the 16th and 17th of this month, notifying of the German Empire's annexation of Czechoslovakia and Germany's establishment of a protectorate in Czechoslovakia, have been received. In response to the above-mentioned notes, in order to avoid creating the erroneous impression that our government is indifferent to the Czechoslovakian incident, the Soviet government cannot remain silent, and hereby expresses our government's true attitude towards the above-mentioned incident as follows, as a reply:</p>
<p>First, the political and historical views expressed in the first paragraph of the German announcement as its basis and reasons, especially the statement that the existence of the Czechoslovakian state is a source of constant disturbance and threat to European peace, and that Czechoslovakia lacks vitality and therefore requires the special protection of the German Empire, cannot be considered consistent with the correct facts recognized by the world. In fact, since the First World War, the Czechoslovakian Republic has indeed been one of the few European countries with internal peace and truly implementing a policy of external peace.</p>
<p>"Second, the Soviet government has never heard of any clause in any country's constitution that authorizes the head of state to declare the cancellation of the country's independence without the consent of the people. It is difficult to believe that any nation would voluntarily cancel its independence and merge into another country, especially with regard to a nation that has fought for independence for hundreds of years and has recently been independent for twenty years. Accordingly, the signing of the Berlin Treaty by the President of Czechoslovakia on the 15th of this month has not been approved by the people of the country, and therefore clearly violates Articles 64 and 65 of the Czechoslovakian Constitution. Therefore, the above-mentioned treaty cannot be considered legally valid.</p>
<p>"Third, the principle of national self-determination often cited by the German government includes the free expression of the people's will. This expression cannot be replaced by the signature of one or two people, no matter how high their position. In this incident, there was no expression of the will of the Czech people, not even in the form of a referendum as was used to decide on Silesia and the Sarre region.</p>
<p>"Fourth, since the Czech people did not express any will, the occupation of Czechoslovakia by the German army and the subsequent actions of the German government can only be regarded as arbitrary, violent, and aggressive acts.</p>
<p>"Fifth, with regard to the subsequent change of national status of Slovakia and its vassalage to the German Empire, since the Slovak people also did not express any will, the above comments should also apply in full.</p>
<p>"Sixth, the actions of the German government are also a signal for the barbaric invasion of Carpatho-Ruthenia by Hungarian troops, violating the basic rights of its people.</p>
<p>"Seventh, for the above-mentioned reasons, the Soviet government cannot recognize the incorporation of the Czech Republic and Slovakia into the German Empire in any form as legal, in accordance with generally accepted standards of international law and justice, or the principle of national self-determination.</p>
<p>"Eighth, in the opinion of the Soviet government, the actions of the German government not only cannot eliminate any threat to universal peace, but on the contrary, have created and aggravated this threat, undermining the political stability of Central Europe, increasing the anxiety already created in Europe, and once again striking at the sense of security of all peoples. "The above points are respectfully submitted to your government for transmittal." (19th TASS)</p>

<h3>Chinese Air Force Repeatedly Makes Surprise Attacks, Japanese Troops in Guangzhou are Panicked</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: It has been raining continuously in recent days, and the weather in Guangdong has been mostly cloudy and less sunny. The Chinese army has also prepared for the counter-offensive military operations, sending the air force to bomb the Japanese army's positions, destroying their artillery emplacements, and then launching fierce attacks with infantry units. According to those who have just escaped from Guangzhou, on the morning of the 15th, a small squadron of the new Chinese Air Force was discovered in the sky over the northeast suburbs of Guangzhou, at an altitude of approximately 8,000 feet. They then flew to the vicinity of the Tianhe Airport and circled around. Japanese aircraft hurriedly took off to engage them. The Chinese aircraft then dropped six or seven large bombs on the Tianhe Airport, and a fire immediately broke out inside the airport, with thick smoke billowing. At this time, several Japanese aircraft had already taken off, but were controlled by the Chinese squadron and dared not venture out far. With their mission accomplished, the Chinese squadron calmly flew west. When the Chinese aircraft dropped bombs, the Japanese anti-aircraft artillery fired indiscriminately, with rumbling sounds lasting for dozens of minutes, but they ultimately failed to stop the air raid. On the 16th, the Chinese squadron flew to the near suburbs again, threatening the Japanese troops near the eastern suburbs and Conghua. After repeated air raids, the Japanese army in Guangzhou declared martial law and dispatched more puppet troops to defend key points in the urban area, with particularly strict inspections of travelers. The Japanese army and the puppet maintenance committee in Guangzhou have recently repeatedly telegraphed for reinforcements, claiming that the Chinese army is planning to encircle Guangzhou. On the 17th, two Japanese ships, fully loaded with Japanese soldiers, entered the port from Humen and were transferred to the northeast to strengthen defenses, and shallow-water warships were dispatched to the Xijiang and Dongjiang rivers to assist the Japanese army on land in vigilance. Currently, there are about 50 Japanese rubber boats and about 2,000 Japanese and Taiwanese soldiers distributed in the areas of the mouth of the Xijiang River in Sanshui, Xinxu, Mian, Ganggen, etc. There has been no change in the Japanese army in the Jiujiang area. The Japanese army in the Foshan area recently gathered more than 1,000 people, led by Yitian, and on the 14th, they advanced along the Bijiang to Daliang Highway, invading Daliang and using bandits as guides to attack Shunde City, occupying the Shunde Public Office. Japanese soldiers and bandits took the opportunity to rob wealthy households in the areas of Daliang Zhu Yuanli, Wenxiu Bridge, Bazha, and Huagai Li, and ordered the shops on Bijian Road, Hua Street, and Huagai Road to resume business. Then, another team of soldiers advanced along the Rongliang Highway to spy on Shatou Township. It is heard that the Japanese army's harassment in the Rongqi Daliang area was because they had detected that a certain guerrilla unit was active in the area. Therefore, after occupying Daliang, they also ravaged Shatou, and then built temporary defensive works in Shatou and erected small steel cannons to prevent the guerrillas on the opposite bank from copying out from Rongqi Guizhou. Since the Japanese army occupied Shatou, the road from the southern suburbs of Guangzhou through Pingzhou Shunde to Hong Kong and Macao has been blocked. It happened that the Gangyue Jinshan Company's transport ship sailed from Guangzhou to Hong Kong at 4:00 p.m. on the 16th, so the number of passengers increased sharply.</p>
<h3>Guilin's Market is Booming, Wuzhou is Declining</h3>
<p>Guangxi Correspondence: Wuzhou is the only large commercial port in Guangxi. Its upstream can directly reach Guiliu, Yongyu, and its downstream can directly connect to Guangzhou and Hong Kong. Ships gather and transportation is convenient, so it is the general hub for the import and export of goods. After the fall of Guangzhou, the lower reaches of the Pearl River were blocked, and the transportation of import and export goods in Guangxi Province was completely suspended. As a result, the market environment of the entire province changed along with the transportation routes. In the border areas, such as Taiping and Longzhou, due to their geographical proximity to Annam, most of the goods are gathered in Longzhou, and are transported in and out through the Vietnam Railway, from the Zhennanguan side. In the central part, in the Nanning, Xunzhou, and Yulin areas, due to their proximity to the southern route of Guangdong Province, they are transshipped by land, with Beihai or Guangzhou Bay on the southern route as the import and export points. In the Wuzhou area of eastern Guangxi, most goods are transported downstream to Zhaoqing, and then via the land route of Gaoming Heshan, through the waterway of Jiangmen Shiqi, until the export at Qianshan. The import is also the same. However, the above-mentioned transportation, with its twists and turns by water and land, and its winding roads, is extremely difficult for general transportation merchants. Until the end of last year, the section of the railway from Hengyang to Guilin was completed, and it was possible to travel directly from Hunan to Guilin. The authorities took the opportunity to develop the economy of the southwest to support the long-term war of resistance, and then sought to directly connect the Zhejiang and Guangxi provinces. At present, the imported goods needed by Guangxi Province, such as wool and cotton fabrics, paper, cigarettes, and cosmetics, come directly from Jinhua, but indirectly from Wenzhou and Ningbo. Since the opening of the Zhejiang-Guangxi railway, the business in Guilin has temporarily flourished. Merchants from Liuzhou, Qingyuan, and Pingle, who used to go to Wuzhou to purchase goods, have now turned to the Guilin market. As a result, the business in Wuzhou has plummeted. Moreover, Wuzhou is often bombed by airplanes, and the import and export offices, having no business to operate in Wuzhou, have moved to Guilin to start businesses. Three months ago, the prices of goods in Guilin (referring to imported goods) were often 30% to 40% higher than those in Wuzhou. Now, the prices in Guilin are lower than those in Wuzhou, and there are various daily necessities that are available in Guilin but not in Wuzhou. This is because the transportation situation has changed, and the market environment has also changed greatly. After the start of the second phase of the War of Resistance, Guilin became the center of military, political, and economic activity in the southwest, so the liveliness of its market has also progressed by leaps and bounds.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province Fisheries Ravaged</h3>
<p>Dinghai Correspondence: The Zhoushan Archipelago in eastern Zhejiang consists of numerous islands, scattered like stars. In total, there are over two hundred islands. Among them, the waters near Liheng, Daishan, Taohua, Qushan, Changtu, and Putuo Islands are particularly rich in fish, with a total fishing area of 28,800 nautical miles, making it a major fishing ground for our country. In the past, approximately 4,000 large fishing boats, 5,000 medium-sized boats, and over 1,000 small boats from the Zhoushan Archipelago set sail annually, totaling more than 12,000 fishing boats of all sizes. Excluding the guest fishermen, local fishing boats numbered around 4,000. Each boat, during a good harvest, could catch tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of catties of fish. In poor harvests, they caught a few thousand to a few hundred catties, varying accordingly. Averaging at 8,000 catties, it yields about 30 million catties of fish. The catch consists mostly of yellow croaker (also known as stone fish), followed by cutlassfish, shark, ribbonfish, and cuttlefish. The usual price ranges from two cents to two dimes per catty, averaging at seven cents. The annual income amounts to two million national currency. Wartime Fisheries: Since the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, the Zhoushan Archipelago has been at the forefront of national defense. Japanese warships constantly patrol the waters. At best, they rob fishermen of their property. At worst, they destroy boats and kill people. The various tragic events are truly beyond description. Due to the fear of the brutality of Japanese warships, fishermen generally refrain from setting sail. However, compelled by hunger and cold, they have no choice but to risk going out to sea sporadically. Recently, pirates have been rampant, with gangs led by figures such as Wang Pinxiong and Pan Zhaocai, who possess large numbers of men and guns, causing particularly severe harm. In February of this year alone, more than thirty fishing boats were robbed, fourteen fishermen were killed, and more than thirty were abducted without a trace. Loss Assessment: According to the recent statistics from the Fisheries Management Office of the Zhejiang Provincial Construction Department, since the start of the Anti-Japanese War, the direct losses to the Zhoushan Archipelago's fisheries amount to 145,950 national currency. The lives of fishermen lost due to being burned to death aboard their boats by Japanese warships, being abandoned on deserted islands, or being thrown into the sea and starving or drowning, are estimated at more than 150 people. Indirect losses are estimated at 2,061,302 national currency. The total losses amount to 2,207,232 national currency. Furthermore, the dried products produced in the Zhoushan Archipelago, such as dried mantis shrimp, are worth 2 million national currency annually. With the fall of Guangzhou, sales channels were cut off, resulting in a loss of 1 million national currency for this item alone.</p>

<h3>The Southwestern Military Conference Determines to Seize the Initiative in the Second Phase of the War, Strengthen Political Institutions, Adjust Personnel, and Decides to Implement a Scorched Earth Policy Economically</h3>
<p>Guangxi Correspondence: Since the Sino-Japanese War shifted from the Northeast to the Southwest, generals throughout the country have become increasingly invigorated. All troops at the front and in the rear have been reorganized. As a result, the military has entered a new phase of the second stage. Because the center of gravity of the war is in the Southwest, the Central Supreme Military Headquarters has specially established an Executive Headquarters in Guilin, appointing General Bai Chongxi as the director, granting him full authority to coordinate and plan. At the beginning of the establishment of the Executive Headquarters, Bai intended to convene generals from all southwestern fronts to jointly discuss major plans. While preparing, Bai went to Chongqing on official business. Upon his return to Guilin, he formally convened the meeting on the 5th of this month, lasting for five consecutive days until the evening of the 10th. The details of the meeting are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Attendees</p>
<p>This meeting was the highest military conference in the Southwest for resisting Japan, and also the first gathering after the establishment of the Southwestern Executive Headquarters. Therefore, all arrangements were orderly and the atmosphere was solemn. The location, time, and list of participants were kept secret before the meeting. The participants included commanders of various war zones in the Southwest, deputy commanders of various group armies, commanders of various field armies, commanders of various armies and divisions, chiefs of staff of various general headquarters, and senior political work directors, totaling over a hundred people. The Central Supreme Military Headquarters also sent Minister Xu Yongchang as a representative to attend and provide guidance. The newly appointed Deputy Commander of a certain group army, General Cai Tingkai, also rushed from Chongqing to Guilin to attend the meeting. Some who held positions at the front line were unable to attend due to their duties and transportation constraints, and designated representatives to attend. The solemn atmosphere and the enthusiasm were unprecedented for gatherings in Guilin. The participants were all senior officers bearing the great responsibility of defending the country and reviving the nation.</p>
<p>Meeting Circumstances</p>
<p>Many decisions made during the meeting concerned military secrets, which cannot be disclosed to the outside world, nor can they be leaked. What can be said is that from a proactive perspective, the meeting discussed what military strategies could enhance strength and strive for ultimate victory, and what political strategies could consolidate the revolutionary political front. From a passive perspective, it discussed how to coordinate political and cultural forces, implement the National Covenant, promote national spiritual mobilization, and elevate the revolutionary spirit of the entire nation. The order of the meeting was as follows: first, generals and representatives reported on their operational experiences over the past twenty months, as well as problems related to replenishment, training, and supplies. Then, in sequence, matters related to military, political, and economic sectors were discussed. Generals and representatives expressed their opinions and thoroughly examined the issues.</p>
<p>Policy Decisions</p>
<p>Regarding military matters, a unanimous decision was made on the strategy of protracted war, striving for an active position. Whether fighting at the front or in the rear, an active position should be maintained. Regarding political matters, it was decided to coordinate political and military efforts, and strengthen political institutions at all levels. Regarding economic matters, it was decided to implement a scorched earth policy and blockade the enemy's economy. Regarding cultural matters, it was decided to increase efforts and expand propaganda. Regarding personnel and financial matters, whether in military or political affairs, personnel must be reorganized, seeking only to select the virtuous and capable, loyal to the country and the nation. Reforming and adjusting military management is also an urgent task, eliminating all accumulated malpractices. In addition, there was close discussion of various strategies for commanding troops, training troops, and employing troops in the war of resistance. In summary, the results of the Southwestern Military Conference were: first, it achieved an unprecedented and powerful unity of spirit; second, it greatly invigorated and appropriately coordinated military and political efforts in the Southwest, in order to reap the fruits of victory in the second phase of the war of resistance. Therefore, this meeting not only added a special luster to the mountains and rivers of Guilin, but also brought unlimited optimism to the future of the war.</p>
<h3>China and the Soviet Union Open Air Route, Chongqing-Hami Segment to Be Tested Immediately</h3>
<p>Guiyang Special Dispatch: In order to facilitate transportation between China and the Soviet Union, plans were made in September of last year to open a direct air route from Hankou to Almaty. After several months of preparation, it has been decided that the air route will start from Chongqing and be divided into two segments. One segment is from Chongqing to Hami, called the Chongqing-Hami (渝哈) line. The segment from Hami to Almaty has not yet been named. The Chongqing-Hami segment is scheduled for its first test flight on the 20th of this month, with stops in Xi'an, Lanzhou, Wuwei, and Jiuquan. It is expected that in the future, there will be at least one round trip each week, carrying passengers and mail.</p>
<h3>With Tensions Rising in Europe, Hong Kong Strengthens Defenses, Authorities Declare Military Equipment Robust</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: In the current situation where the Sino-Japanese War in the Far East is intensifying, Hong Kong, which has long been ruled by the British Empire, feels deeply uneasy. Unexpectedly, the situation in Europe, worsened by Hitler's annexation of Czechoslovakia, is even more precarious. Therefore, Hong Kong, small as a bullet, feels that today's paradise of peace may become tomorrow's land of terror. Thus, the current fate of Hong Kong and the British authorities' efforts to strengthen its military are worthy of attention. The various measures taken in the past two days are even more worthy of our consideration. Here is a detailed account:</p>
<p>Singapore Maneuvers Involving Hong Kong Troops</p>
<p>Since the Japanese army's invasion of Hainan Island, communication between Hong Kong and Singapore has been cut off, which has a considerable impact on British military affairs in the Far East. Therefore, in addition to actively strengthening Singapore's defenses, large-scale land, sea, and air force exercises have recently been held, indirectly demonstrating power against Japan. The exercise dates are scheduled to begin on the 17th. In addition to the full mobilization of all local garrison troops, British ships stationed in Hong Kong will also sail to participate. This indicates that Hong Kong and Singapore's defenses are inseparable. Three days ago, British ships stationed in Hong Kong waters, including the HMS "Effingham" and HMS "Dorsetshire" (cruisers), HMS "Encounter", HMS "Danae", HMS "Dauntless", HMS "Diamond", HMS "Suffolk" (destroyers), as well as the aircraft carrier HMS "Eagle", transport ship HMS "Medway", and several submarines, sailed towards Singapore under the command of the flagship HMS "Kent". Among them, the "Dorsetshire," "Encounter," "Danae," and "Diamond" patrolled the Strait of Malacca and are scheduled to arrive in Singapore on the 17th. After the exercises are completed, they will return to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Coastal Defenses Exceptionally Solid</p>
<p>After the news of the tense situation in Czechoslovakia reached Hong Kong, the hearts of people in Hong Kong were shaken. Fearing that this would affect the market, the military authorities openly announced the general situation of Hong Kong's coastal defenses, stating: Since 1936, the port fortresses of Hong Kong have been under reconstruction. After several years, all work has been completed. The forts themselves are incredibly strong, and no air raid bombing can destroy them. The close connection between the forts and the necessary preparations for various defenses are also exceptionally thorough and safe. The artillery of each fortress is the latest type of weapon in Britain, with a long range and strong destructive power, making it impossible for foreign warships to approach Hong Kong waters. As for the army, the defense arrangements in coastal areas have long been completed. British and Indian troops stationed in Hong Kong are constantly on high alert, and the strength of the air force and improvements in air defense preparations are sufficient to resist any foreign invasion. Even if an emergency suddenly occurs, Hong Kong will be safe and sound.</p>
<p>Naval Authorities Deepen Seabed</p>
<p>At the end of last week, the Hong Kong naval authorities, suddenly ordered the water authorities to order the fishing boats moored in Aberdeen (where Hong Kong's fishing fleets gather, and where British ships and warships first approached Hong Kong, actually the front gateway for Hong Kong's communication with the outside world) to leave and move to the waters off Wong Chuk Hang. After receiving the order, the fishing households moored their fishing boats at the designated location. However, because the fishing households and residents on shore did not know what the Hong Kong government's intention was, everyone was panic-stricken. At the same time, sources said that the foundation work for the defense works along the coast of Aberdeen, such as machine gun positions, searchlights, and anti-aircraft guns, had been under construction for two months and would soon be completed. At that time, the Hong Kong authorities plan to designate the Aberdeen area as a military zone and deploy large ships to moor there. However, the Hong Kong authorities specifically issued an interpretation of this matter the other day, saying that because the waters of Aberdeen Harbor are gradually being silted up, they plan to send specialists to measure the depth and deepen the seabed to avoid obstructing fishing boats. Therefore, they had to order the fishing boats to move elsewhere.</p>
<p>Recruiting Air Force Reserves</p>
<p>After London decided to recruit local people in various colonies to participate in land, sea, and air defense, and decided to organize five hundred air force teams to cope with future events, the Hong Kong government also publicly announced on the 12th that it would recruit air force reserve personnel. After strict training, they will be formed into a strong air force directly under the Hong Kong government, so that they can be called upon to assist in air defense and cope with war when necessary. After the news came out, many Chinese and Westerners applied for it. However, the Hong Kong government did not announce how many were accepted. It is reported that after the establishment of this air force reserve team, it will use the Kai Tak Airport in Kowloon and the Far East Aviation School as training locations. Under the guidance of active air force officers, they will be taught various skills in driving and combat. After graduation, with the approval of the British authorities, they can become official air force reserves. When necessary, they will be called up by the government and sent to fight. Therefore, it is expected that after one year, Hong Kong's air force strength will have greater progress.</p>
<h3>Guizhou Province Strictly Enforces Opium Prohibition and Sends Personnel to Seriously Report Violations</h3>
<p>Guiyang Correspondence: The matter of Guizhou Province prohibiting the planting of opium is being implemented in phases according to the planned schedule and was fully completed last year. Now that the time for opium seedlings to emerge from the soil has passed, and the time for fruiting and collecting resin is not far away, the provincial government is sincerely concerned that there may still be wild or illegally planted opium within the borders of various counties. In accordance with the provisions of the Opium Prohibition Implementation Regulations, a general reporting is being implemented in districts again, with March, April, and May of this year as the period for general reporting. In addition to the counties where prohibition was implemented in the first, second, and third phases, which are still responsible for reporting by the administrative supervisors' offices in their respective jurisdictions, the provincial government has dispatched Zhou Nongzhang and others to Qianxi, Ziyun, Zhijin, Anan, Puan, Xingyi, Langdai, Anshun, Puding, Zhenning, Panxian, Anlong, Dading, Shuicheng, Pingba, Qingzhen, Guanling, Xingren, Zhenfeng, Ceheng, Bijie, and Weining, twenty-two counties where prohibition was implemented in the fourth phase, to seriously report violations according to the prescribed period, in order to emphasize the opium prohibition policy.</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Fly Over Qingpu, Bombing Xixiang</h3>
<p>Qingpu Correspondence: Xixiang Zhangliantang Town in Qingpu is crisscrossed with waterways and strategically important. The county government is located in the town, and the Tian Xiushan unit of the Loyal National Salvation Army is also stationed nearby. Japanese and puppet troops have repeatedly invaded by speedboat, but have been bravely repelled by the Chinese army. At 1:00 PM on the 18th, three Japanese planes flew over the town and bombed it, dropping a total of six bombs, destroying only a few houses. At around 2:00 PM on the same day, two Japanese planes circled over Jinze Town and dropped three bombs, one of which hit the watchtower next to the Houda Temple in the town.

<h3>He Tianjian Teaches Painting, Limited to Ten Students</h3>

His calligraphy is based on the Wei and Jin dynasties, and his paintings follow the Song and Yuan dynasties. His landscapes are based on the Five Dynasties and the Two Song dynasties. He taught at the North and South Art Schools, producing many students. His teaching approach has always emphasized rigor. Beginners focus on basic exercises, with a thorough grounding in the source of every tree and stone. For example, trees adopt the crab claw and deer antler methods, while stones use the hemp fiber and folded ribbon wrinkles. Progressing from shallow to deep, principles and interests are both considered. Before the war, he accepted an invitation from friends in Beiping and Tianjin to bring his masterpieces to exhibit, which shook the art world in the capital. Recently, seeing that painting has become increasingly desolate, he is now fulfilling his long-cherished wish to promote the quintessence of the nation and promote painting by enrolling students and teaching them, limited to ten students. The application period ends on April 10th. The fee for national painting is 15 yuan per month for one face-to-face lesson per week, and 22 yuan per month for two face-to-face lessons per week.

<h3>West League Football Concludes This Week: Lido Surveying Wins Junior Cup at Jiaozhou Park on Thursday Afternoon</h3>
<p>The West League football schedule for this week is the final week. On Thursday (the 23rd) at 3:00 PM, the Junior Cup final will be between the Lido team and the Surveying team. If it rains at that time, the match will be postponed to Sunday afternoon at 3:00 PM. The originally scheduled match between Lido and Rowing on that day will not take place. Lido's strength is quite strong, so the Surveying team is unlikely to be a match for them, and the championship seems secure. In the reserve division, Donghua will play St. Francis. Donghua had a very high chance of winning the championship in this division, but unfortunately, they lost to the West Police team last week, so the outcome of this match is crucial. The schedule for this week is as follows:</p>
<p>Thursday (23rd): Lido vs. Surveying (Junior Final) at 3:00 PM at Jiaozhou Park.</p>
<p>Saturday (25th): East Selkirk vs. West Police (First Division) at 3:00 PM at the Racecourse; St. Francis vs. Donghua (Reserves) at 3:00 PM at Jiaozhou Park.</p>

<h3>European Situation Unstable; Japan Again Plots Concessions; Japanese Newspaper Even Claims Concession's Existence Illegal; Puppet "Reformed Government" Organizes Anti-British Alliance</h3>
<p>Foreign News: In view of the seriousness of the European situation, Japan has now proposed the cancellation of the Shanghai International Settlement, and advocated that the International Settlement should be treated the same as other Japanese-occupied areas. According to reports, Japan made this request last autumn when the European situation was serious, but it was temporarily shelved after the signing of the Munich Agreement. Now the same request has been put forward again. Yesterday morning, Japanese newspapers claimed that the existence of the International Settlement was illegal.</p>
<p>The puppet "Reformed Government" has recently organized a so-called "Anti-British Alliance" in Nanjing. The organization of the alliance is to incite major and minor traitors and people in the occupied areas to launch an "anti-British movement." The puppet "Reformed Government"'s open anti-British movement is backed by unseen hands. Since the August 13th Shanghai battle, British officials and the public have shown great sympathy for China's resistance against Japan, and have recently lent large sums of money to the Chinese government, causing jealousy from the puppet regime. The puppet "government" has issued a notice ordering various puppet "organizations" in the occupied areas to send representatives to Nanjing to attend the "Anti-British Alliance" meeting as soon as possible. The puppet "government"'s notice also pointed out that Britain caused the May 30th Massacre in Shanghai, leased the Shanghai concession, shielded the Shanghai Foreign Court, controlled the Chinese Customs administration, and harmed compatriots by importing opium into China. There is also an "Appeal to the Elders, Fathers, Brothers and Sisters of Jiangsu," which instructs Jiangsu puppet "organizations" to distribute it to various groups.</p>
<h3>Japan Plots to Strengthen Central China Intelligence; Personnel Mutually Reassigned</h3>
<p>Mr. Kaso, Director of the Intelligence Department of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, came to Shanghai the day before yesterday to plan to enhance Japan's intelligence work in the Central China area. In addition, the Japanese Propaganda Department has also recently reassigned its Central China propaganda personnel. Lieutenant Colonel Miyawaki was ordered to come to Shanghai yesterday, while Lieutenant Colonel Nagai, the former chief of the Hankou branch, was transferred to Beiping. Lieutenant Colonel Kaneko, the leader of the China propaganda team, was transferred back to Tokyo for another position.</p>
<h3>"Central China Company" Controls Silkworm Eggs</h3>
<p>The Qingming Festival is approaching, and the silkworm breeding season is just around the corner. The seed production farms in the occupied counties have all been seized by the Japanese puppets and are controlled by the Central China Company. The numbers are as follows: Suzhou Hushu Pass: Yiyou, Yunong, Zhongxing, Jingbin, four farms; Dongting East Mountain: Shiqiao, Zhouxing, Huayun, three farms; Qian Wanli Bridge: Yunong, Sanwuguan, Guangfu Town Yongyi, four farms; Wuxi Zhaimentown: Yongtai, Qianqiao, Tianyi, Xinantown Yongyan, Zhangjingqiao, Jinong, Xishan, Baokang, Guohua, Houyangfang Qian Dayou, Shungeng, Qiusheng, Zhangjing Town Dasheng, Meicun Guangming, Xishuiguan Huangshiqiao Tianfeng, Fengnian, Gaochedubridge Guangming No. 2 Farm, Xueyan Bridge Qiuxin, North Xizhang Youjiatai Hu's Junior High, Peishengguan, Yanqiaorenwu Hall, Cunqian Yinong, Yanjia Bridge Dayou, An Town Dayuan, Zhoujing Lane Xinhua, Wangzhuang Hexing, Dangtoutown Dayou, Wutangmen Yufeng, Fengzhuang Hedong, a total of twenty-seven farms; Yixing Heqiao Dayuantian, Fangqiao Sanle, Linong, two farms; Changzhou Hedong Town Pengxi, Caoqiao Zhenhua, two farms; Jiangyin Fenggezhuang Tianfeng, Mazhen Xinfu, two farms.

<h3>Japanese Puppets Vigorously Implement Narcotic Policy in Pudong; Shanghai West Earth Firms and Gambling Dens Plan to Move There</h3>
<p>The narcotic policy implemented by the Japanese puppets in the five districts of Yangsi, Tangqiao, Yangjing, Lihang, and Gaohang in Pudong has achieved preliminary results in the past year. Countless thieves, ruffians, and idlers who are directly affected by narcotics have been added. It is reported that they plan to expand the scope to increase revenue. Therefore, the future Pudong will become smoky and miasmic, equivalent to a second Shanghai West. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Opium</p>
<p>All the opium sources in the opium dens along the coast of Pudong are either secretly transported by people, or purchased from the earth firms in Shanghai West. However, the distance is too far and it is inconvenient. Therefore, they will follow the example of Shanghai West and open an earth firm. If the conditions are negotiated, it will be implemented next month. At that time, the opium dens in Nanshi can also purchase earth from Pudong. Currently, it is estimated that about 20-30% of the people living in Pudong are addicted to opium, and most of them are puppet officials.</p>
<p>Drugs</p>
<p>After the price of opium soared, some addicts in Pudong who could not afford to buy it have switched to smoking heroin. There are drug dens open in each Lilong. It can be seen in the alley, sitting on the ground, addicted to drugs. They are everywhere, skinny. It is estimated that about 30-40% of the people are addicted to drugs. The puppet police are the most addicted, and it is more convenient to buy drugs than to buy earth, because there are several drug dens open in each town.</p>
<p>Gambling</p>
<p>After the closure of the Yongli Company gambling den on Dongchang Road last year, a group of gangsters opened a Huahui Datong in the back street of Dongchang Road, opening three rounds a day to lure people into gambling. Each Lilong is also equipped with a listening tube boat, operating in all directions. Generally ignorant men and women are flocking to it. The major gambling dens in Shanghai West are now reportedly forced to close down due to various reasons. In addition to planning to move to Hongkou, several gambling den owners are now operating in Pudong, planning to move the gambling dens from Shanghai West to Pudong. This matter is being secretly carried out. Therefore, Pudong will soon become a second Shanghai West.</p>
<h3>Zhenhai Remains Peaceful After Another Bombardment by Japanese Warships; Garrison Fiercely Retaliated; Damage to Haimen Was Very Light; Ships on the Shanghai-Ningbo Route Still Sailing</h3>
<p>In an attempt to disrupt the rear order, in the past month, several Japanese warships have been shuttling back and forth along the coast of eastern Zhejiang, and from time to time firing and bombing the ports of Zhenhai, Haimen, Dinghai, and Xiangshan to obstruct foreign ships. Around 10:00 AM the day before yesterday, six Japanese warships arrived again outside Zhenhai, moored in the waters of Ligang Qiliyu, and then fired on Zhenhai, totaling more than 400 rounds, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. The Japanese warships gradually withdrew until 2:00 PM. At that time, the garrison fiercely retaliated, but it is known that the local loss was minimal, only about ten houses were destroyed, because the people in the fortress area had been evacuated early, so there were no casualties. At the same time, four Japanese aircraft flew to Haimen to drop bombs, and the damage was also minor. As for the situation in Ningbo, it was exceptionally peaceful. Shops were operating as usual, and there was no panic at all. Ships on the Shanghai-Ningbo route were also sailing as usual. The German ship Hana and the Italian ship De Pinglun set sail for Ningbo at 5:00 PM yesterday. At 5:00 PM yesterday, it was also reported by the relevant authorities in this city that several Japanese warships had bombarded Zhenhai again yesterday. The details were not mentioned.</p>
<p>Strict Precautions in Various Coastal Areas</p>
<p>The Ningbo-Wenzhou-Taizhou defense commanders have all received orders from Commander-in-Chief Liu to take strict precautions along the coast of eastern Zhejiang to prevent Japanese troops from landing by surprise. Therefore, the precautions in the Yongjiang, Jiaojiang, and Oujiang are very strict. Ships are prohibited from sailing at night, and passengers and goods are inspected. Ships must be approved in advance. If necessary, all rivers will be completely blocked, and all blocking materials are ready. Solid defense projects have been built along the river, and heavy troops are stationed there. If the Japanese army invades, they will be severely attacked.</p>
<p>Japanese Warships Diverted, Shanghai-Ningbo Still Open</p>
<p>The Shanghai foreign shipping companies telegraphed Ningbo to inquire and learned that the Japanese warships outside the ports of Haimen, Jiaojiang, and Ningbo Yongjiang had diverted and the local area was peaceful as usual. Therefore, the Italian ship De Pinglun of the Sino-Italian Company and the German ship Hana of the German Far East Company sailed from Shanghai to Ningbo as usual yesterday. However, the Haimen route was approved for resumption by the Wenzhou-Taizhou defense commander, but the consuls of Portugal and Germany in Shanghai consulted the Japanese naval authorities, but the Japanese side still obstructed them, citing that the military affairs of Haimen, Zhejiang, were not over. Only the Maller ship sailed to Haimen on the 18th, but still sailed back to Ningbo, but did not take passengers.</p>
<h3>Candidates for British and American Directors of the Board of Works Have All Been Nominated</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reported that the Shanghai British Association's pre-election of five candidates for the Board of Works was completed on Saturday and Sunday after a week. Members cast a total of 66 votes. Yesterday (19th), the association announced that it had nominated Keswick of Jardine Matheson, Mitchell of Taikoo, Bauer of Asiatic Petroleum, Hailey of Brunner Mond, and McDonald of Tientsin Wharf as candidates.

According to the Board of Works, the election is scheduled for April 12th and 13th. The Chinese directors of the Board of Works do not participate in these elections. Chinese residents of Shanghai will elect their own Chinese directors in late April, totaling five.</p>
<h3>Japanese Customs Officer's Irregular Conduct; Customs Commissioner Lo Has Reprimanded; Cautioned to Abide By The Rules Hereafter Otherwise the Customs Authorities Are Resolved to Take Action</h3>
<p>Modern News Agency: A Japanese customs officer of the Jianghai Customs anti-smuggling team has recently abused his power by taking advantage of his authority to arbitrarily board foreign ships, illegally search them, and arrest Chinese people without authorization, who were then sent to the Japanese military headquarters. This matter has aroused resentment from all sides. British and American shippers are now discussing countermeasures. It is reported that Mr. Rutherford, the British Customs Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs, has investigated the matter and found it to be true. He believes that this action by the Japanese customs officer violates the customs administrative regulations and should be stopped. He summoned all the Japanese customs officers in the field on Saturday afternoon, reprimanded them, and cautioned them to strictly abide by the principles of service and perform their duties in the future. No more irregular actions are allowed, otherwise the customs authorities will not tolerate it and will take appropriate measures.</p>
<h3>"Transport Permit" Can Be Resolved Immediately; Rice Transported to Shanghai As Usual; Bean and Rice Market Strictly Implements Price Limit</h3>
<p>The rice market, which has just stabilized, has risen again due to the problem of transport permits. The bean and rice market strictly maintains the price limit, the Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee actively investigates rice reserves, and the purchase of foreign rice has just begun, ensuring that there will be no panic in people's food. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Transport Permit Fee Can Be Resolved Immediately</p>
<p>After the Shanghai rice merchants, through the guild's persuasion, abide by the price limit and dredge the sources of supply, they purchase as much as possible in the market, and send people to the producing areas to purchase. Unexpectedly, the so-called transport permit in the producing areas, including various miscellaneous fees, originally required about 50 cents per stone. Recently, seeing the large-scale purchase of rice by rice merchants, they increased the transport permit fee to one yuan per stone. The rice merchants temporarily stopped transportation due to the increased burden and increased costs. According to rice industry insiders yesterday, the problem is being dredged and will not become a stalemate, and a solution is expected soon.</p>
<p>Goods From Producing Areas Will Not Be Cut Off</p>
<p>Due to the problem of transport permits, some rice merchants took the opportunity to make trouble and released various groundless rumors, causing the market, which had been stable for a short time, to rise again. However, rice boats from the interior to Shanghai have continued to arrive in recent days, only the quantity has decreased slightly. It is generally expected that after the transport permit problem is resolved, the large amount of food rice stored in the producing areas can be transported to Shanghai. According to the current situation, the source from the producing areas will not be cut off.</p>
<p>Market Strictly Implements Price Limit</p>
<p>In order to prevent manipulation, the Bean and Rice Market has stipulated methods to ban free trading, and strictly implement the Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee's price limit of "14 yuan for high-quality white rice, and other qualities should be priced accordingly." Therefore, although the price of rice in the market has risen in recent days, it is still within the limit of 14 yuan. Although a few rice shops in the market inevitably sell inferior goods as high-quality goods, residents can report to the authorities for sanctions if they find that the selling price exceeds 14 yuan.</p>
<p>Actively Investigate City's Rice Reserves</p>
<p>In order to understand the exact amount of rice sold in this city and use it as a reference for evaluation, the Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee immediately sent Mr. Jin to investigate rice reserves in the two concessions. According to a reporter from the New News Agency, the investigation is currently underway. The first step in the investigation, the work of all large and small rice warehouses in the two concessions, has been completed. The second step, the work of sending forms and asking each warehouse to fill in the number of rice reserves, has also begun. If there is a deliberate underreporting of the amount of rice reserves, it will be regarded as intentionally manipulating the people's food, and society will sanction it. Therefore, the exact amount of rice reserves in Shanghai will soon be fully understood.</p>
<h3>It is rumored that Xiao'an Will Travel East</h3>
<p>It is rumored that the puppet "Mayor of Shanghai" Xiao'an is scheduled to travel to Japan at the end of this month to attend the "Urban Economic Conference" convened by the Japanese government. At the same time, the puppet "Mayor of Nanjing" Gao Guanwu, the puppet "Mayor of Hangzhou" Xie Ke, and the puppet "Mayor of Xuzhou" Zhang Yunsheng, who are under the wing of the puppet "Reformed Government," will also go separately to perform the ugly act of flattering their "masters."</p>
<h3>Fengxian Guerrilla Forces Annihilate Remnants of Japanese Army, Five to Six Hundred Guerrillas Encircle Retreating Japanese, Shenjia Garden and Xiaotang Ablaze</h3>
<p>The guerrilla force led by Li Zhiming in Fengxian, Pudong, has been extremely active recently. The night before last (the 18th), they led five to six hundred guerrillas to encircle the remaining Japanese troops near Nanqiao in four directions. They fought fiercely with the Japanese all night. The Japanese troops, numbering only seventy or eighty, were outnumbered and suffered heavy losses. The Japanese troops then retreated to Shenjia Garden, while telegraphing to Minhang for reinforcements. After receiving the report, the army immediately dispatched a large force. While passing near Xiaotang, they encountered an ambush by guerrillas and a fierce battle ensued. The Japanese troops were unable to hold and fled southwest. As a result of the battle, both sides suffered considerable casualties. During the intense shelling, many houses in the town were burned down, especially in the area west and south of Hengjing, with the fire reaching Hongfu Building to the north, which also suffered significant damage.</p>
<p>Transportation Restored in the Huangpu River Area</p>
<p>Transportation on the south Huangpu River, which was once blocked, with all ferries to Pudong Xidongjiadu, Zhoujiadu, Nanmatou, Bailianjing, and Wangjiadu suspended, creating a serious situation as if a major battle was about to break out, has gradually resumed since yesterday (the 19th). However, Japanese and puppet police detectives are densely deployed and conduct strict inspections.</p>
<p>Inland Waterway Transportation Disrupted</p>
<p>Recently, the Chinese guerrilla forces hiding in various towns and villages in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have been extremely active, and inland waterway transportation has been severely affected, with frequent disruptions. It is reported that the small steamships of the Shanghai Inland Water Steamship Company, which operate routes to Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou, have suspended services to Pinghu and Haiyan due to intense fighting, in addition to the Hangzhou and Changzhou routes, which have been suspended for a long time. The Xinwuku liner has also temporarily suspended operations due to unrest along the route. The Jiaxing and Huzhou liners only load cargo and do not carry passengers. The Xie Li and Heng Feng steamship companies have also stopped selling passenger tickets to Suzhou, Wuxi, Jiangyin, and other ports along the route, indicating that the situation in various inland river areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang is unstable.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Economic Affairs Cables Instructions: For-Profit Corporations to Maintain Status Quo, The 28th Year Has Begun, Shanghai's Environment Remains Unique</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce issued a notice yesterday to various trade associations and member stores, stating that the Ministry of Economic Affairs sent a cable stating that the "Provisional Measures for Maintaining the Status Quo of For-Profit Corporations During Extraordinary Periods," promulgated by the National Government on April 23, 1938, had previously been forwarded to the Chamber for compliance. Now that the 28th year has begun and the environment in Shanghai remains unique, the convening of shareholder meetings and the re-election of directors and supervisors of for-profit corporations in the area may still be handled in accordance with the aforementioned measures. The Chamber is requested to inform everyone accordingly. The original text of the provisional measures is as follows: Article 1: These measures shall apply to for-profit corporations in war zones or areas close to war zones when the exercise of their statutory powers is hindered. Article 2: The convening of shareholder meetings and the re-election of directors and supervisors of the for-profit corporation mentioned in the preceding article may be postponed, but this does not apply to government-appointed directors and supervisors of government-business joint ventures.

Article 4: When a for-profit corporation postpones as mentioned in the preceding article, the shareholder executing the business or the director representing the company shall list the reasons and submit them to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval. Article 5: Matters that should be reported to the shareholder meeting as stipulated in the Company Law shall be notified or announced to the shareholders by the shareholder executing the business or the director representing the company in a feasible manner during the postponement. Article 6: If the for-profit corporation has no director representing the company, the actions in the preceding two articles shall be performed by other directors or supervisors. Article 7: These measures shall take effect from the date of promulgation.</p>
<h3>Transferred Postal Workers About to Depart, Establishment of Head Office in Shanghai Solely for Convenience</h3>
<p>After the Shanghai Postal Administration was ordered to transfer sixty-five postal workers of grades A and B, there were rumors that the postal administration was being undermined, or that the postal administration had accepted the demands of the transferred postal workers, and the rumors were varied and inconclusive. According to Mr. Wang Weisheng, the Deputy Director of Postal Affairs of the Bureau, the various external rumors are completely unfounded. The postal workers transferred by the Bureau were ordered to do so, and the sixty-five postal workers are currently on vacation and handling the handover, and are expected to depart in batches at the beginning of next month. As for the establishment of the Shanghai Office of the Postal Administration this time, it is because the Head Office cannot reach everything, and there is no other effect. In the future, all internal administration will be handled by the Office with full authority, and reports will be submitted to the General Post Office on schedule for record. According to the internal postal worker hierarchy of the Post Office, it is divided into (1) Director of Postal Affairs, (2) Deputy Director of Postal Affairs, (3) Postal Officer, (4) Postal Assistant, (5) Postman. The salary is paid as follows: Director of Postal Affairs, 800 yuan per month; Deputy Director of Postal Affairs, 600 to 700 yuan; Postal Officer, Grade A approximately 270 yuan to 500 yuan, Grade B 40 yuan to 270 yuan. It is also rumored that Grade B postal workers are not eligible for transfer, but this regulation was reportedly abolished in 1927. As for foreign postal workers serving in various post offices in China, there are only about seventy or eighty, and their salaries were previously calculated in taels of silver, but now they are paid in yuan.</p>

<h3>Adjustment of Foreign Trade Successful, Imports Decreased, Exports Increased, Increase Production of Domestic Goods, Concentrate on Ports for Export, Purchase Domestic Goods to Replenish Foreign Exchange Fund</h3>
<p>After trade personnel have worked hard to adjust foreign trade, increase exports, and restrict imports, imports have sharply decreased, and exports of domestic goods have increased. Now, efforts will be made to increase the production of major domestic goods, concentrate on ports for export, and purchase domestic goods nationwide to replenish the foreign exchange fund. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Imports Decreased, Exports Increased</p>
<p>Compared with 1936, the import and export trade in 1938 saw a decrease of 55,345,169 yuan in imports and an increase of 19,051,769 yuan in exports. The largest decrease in imports was in metals and mineral ores, totaling 42.93 million yuan, followed by cotton, cotton yarn, cotton money, vehicles and boats, miscellaneous metal products, groceries, wool and its products, candles, soaps, oils, fats, waxes, gums, rosin, medical books, maps, paper, wood and paper products, dyes, pigments, paints, and varnishes, all of which decreased by more than 10 million yuan. The largest increase in exports was in textile fibers, totaling 52.14 million yuan, followed by mineral ores, metals, and metal products, totaling 49.83 million yuan, and then groceries, animals, and animal products, all of which increased by more than 10 million yuan.</p>
<p>Increase Production, Purchase, and Export</p>
<p>The Trade Commission has decided to increase the production of ten major domestic goods, such as silk, tea, tung oil, bristles, leather, and wool, concentrate on exports through Hong Kong, and assess prices in various production areas. The Central Trust Bureau, China Tea Company, China Vegetable Oil Company, Fuhua Company, and local merchants in the industry are entrusted to purchase domestic goods nationwide to replenish the foreign exchange fund. In order to adjust wartime transportation, the Commission has provided its own freight cars to operate between provinces, specifically to load domestic goods for export. All domestic goods that have legally sold foreign exchange will be exempt from export taxes. The Central Trust Bureau will underwrite the insurance for military risks along the way, using an accounting method. If the goods are sold at a loss, the insurance premium will be waived in order to reduce the cost of domestic goods and promote the export of domestic goods.</p>
<h3>"Liverpool" Ship Expected to be Released, Japanese Consul Claims the Case is Now Clear</h3>
<p>The Greek ship "Liverpool," which is represented by the Norwegian company Wah Lun &amp; Co. at the intersection of Wuma Road and Sichuan Road in the city, loaded cargo in Tianjin on the 2nd of this month and sailed to Shanghai. After entering the Wusongkou, it was about to dock at the Longmao Wharf in Pudong when it was suddenly detained by the Japanese Navy, forced to anchor in the center of the Yangshupu Bridge, and was not allowed to unload its cargo. After the Greek Consul-General in Shanghai made representations to the Japanese side, the cargo began to be unloaded on the evening of the 4th. However, the Japanese side still used the excuse that the ship's nationality was unclear and refused to release the ship. It has been detained for almost a month now. According to a report from the Modern News Agency, regarding the detention of the "Liverpool," the Greek Consulate has recently made strong representations again, and clearly stated that the ship is indeed owned by Greek merchants, and all supporting documents are on file in the Consulate. The Japanese side's excuse for detention is completely unjustified. Therefore, the Japanese Consulate has stated that the case is now clear, and it is expected that the ship will be released in the near future.</p>
<h3>Counterfeit Currency in North China Cannot Enter Guerrilla Areas, Actively Plotting Results in Light Abandonment, Even Puppets Know Hearts are Weary and Efforts Futile?</h3>
<p>According to the French-language "Peiping Political News," the "Provisional Government" here previously issued an "order" prohibiting the use of legal tender in North China from March 11th, but this "order" has obviously been ineffective and has been withdrawn in a disguised manner. What is this method? That is, it is stipulated that legal tender can still be used in the "bandit areas," and the so-called "bandit areas" are the guerrilla areas where Chinese military forces are located. The existence of guerrilla areas has long been established, and this time it is only formally recognized by the Japanese and puppet sides. However, apart from the so-called "bandit areas," the territory under the jurisdiction of the Japanese and puppet troops is also pitifully small, because all farmers outside the suburbs refuse to use counterfeit currency, and guerrilla teams treat anyone who possesses counterfeit currency as a traitor. As a result, the area where counterfeit currency can circulate is becoming narrower. In the beginning, the "Provisional Government" put a lot of effort into promoting counterfeit currency, but now it has abandoned its promotion plan in the name of "bandit areas." However, the Japanese and puppet sides here are still sparing no effort to undermine legal tender. It is claimed that "within six months," legal tender can be made to collapse. But in reality, the promotion of counterfeit currency by the "Joint Reserve Bank" has been going on for many months, and the influence of legal tender in North China is still the same. On the contrary, the promotion of counterfeit currency has been unable to penetrate the guerrilla areas. This has also been admitted by the North China puppet "regime" itself.</p>
<h3>Australian Trade Commissioner Returns to Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to the English-language "North China Daily News," Mr. Bowden, the Australian Government Trade Commissioner in Shanghai, who went to Manila and Hong Kong on official business, returned to Shanghai yesterday (the 19th) on the Japanese Empress.</p>
<h3>Due to Rising Food and Fuel Prices, Relief Standards for Refugees Increased, Total Relief Expenses Increase by About 10,000 Yuan Per Month, Rickshaw Pullers Warmly and Politely Decline</h3>
<p>The Board of Directors of the Refugee Relief Association held its eleventh meeting the day before yesterday and resolved the following important matters: (1) Revisions to the Relief Standards for the Second Half of March: As rice and coal prices have risen, with rice reaching 13 yuan per stone and coal reaching 33 yuan per ton, the relief standards for March have been revised. It is estimated that 7 yuan, 7 jiao, 7 fen and a half should be given to every 100 people per day. This month is 31 days, and the full month's relief per person is 2 yuan, 4 jiao, and 1 fen. In addition to the 1 yuan issued in the first half of the month, 1 yuan, 4 jiao, and 1 fen should be issued for the 16 days in the second half of the month. Compared with the previous standards, the revised standards increase by 2 jiao and 5 fen per person per month, and the total relief expenditure will increase by approximately 10,000 yuan. (2) Appointed Ma Qichang and Bao Wenxin as members of the Affairs Committee. (3) Resolved to establish a work training group in the Relief Office to oversee refugee skills training and production, with Chen Heqin as the director and Chen Xianmo as the deputy director. (4) Appointed Ying Chengyi as a member of the Relief Committee. (5) Appointed Ren Shigang, Wang Xingyao, Gao Shiheng, Li Xizhao, Shi Duhui, Pan Yangyao, Gu Bingyuan, Yang Chonggao, Tong Runfu, Cheng Shouchong, Zhang Wenkui, and Yu Tinghui as consultants to the Employment Service Group of the Relief Office. (6) Approved the rules of procedure for the Employment Service Group of the Relief Office. (7) Decided to express appreciation for the excellent results and clear procedures of the Education Production Fund raised by the Education Group Fundraising Committee.</p>
<p>Municipal Joint Broadcast Ends Tonight</p>
<p>The municipal Joint Relief Association for Women and Children's Education Institute's broadcast for fundraising and publicity was held for the third day yesterday, with speeches by Committee Members Cao Zhigong, Wang Jian'e, Wu Ruisheng, and Le Gengbao. It will continue to be held at the Washington Radio Station today, with programs including Pinghua, Tanci, and comedy from Runyu Society and Guangyu Society, which are extremely exciting. The event is scheduled to end at 12:00 tomorrow night. The Institute has also scheduled its first board meeting for the 25th of this month to elect the chairman and director, and actively carry out the Institute's affairs.</p>
<p>Rickshaw Pullers Work Hard and Cannot Bear to Levy Donations</p>
<p>Four rickshaw pullers from the city, Cang Gongwen, He Wushan, Zhu Fengxiang, and Xu Zhulin, in the name of general representatives, suggested to the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association that the city's public rickshaws, totaling 9,500, operate two shifts a day, morning and evening. If each shift donates 1 fen of national currency, each rickshaw can donate 6 jiao per month, and the total monthly donation can be 5,700 yuan, and the annual total can be 68,400 yuan. They requested that the Association liaise with Gu Songmao, Yin Zhiling, and Hou Shaoan, etc. of the Rickshaw Merchants Fundraising Committee, to collect the donations monthly with the rickshaw rental fees, along with the license fees, and deposit them in a designated bank. The Association would then allocate funds monthly. The Association has studied the proposal and deeply appreciates the enthusiasm of the representatives. However, the Association's main purpose is to provide relief to refugees. Considering that the city's rickshaw pullers work hard all day, and the income from their fares is only enough to勉供 provide for clothing and food, the Association cannot bear to levy donations on them to avoid harsh taxes and show consideration. The Association has expressed its deep gratitude to the representatives for their earnest intentions and has replied to Mr. Cang and others for their information.</p>
<p>Writers' Association Actively Involved in Charity Sale</p>
<p>The art charity sale launched by the Chinese Industry and Commerce Art Writers Association has made considerable progress as the person in charge of the association contacted various relevant agencies and organizations. In recent days, major art manufacturers, such as Dujinsheng Silk Weaving Factory's silk fabrics, Shengsheng Art Company's round fans, Xinxing Arts and Crafts Company's batik silk products, Gu Tingkang's collection of antiques, as well as recent pastel paintings, Western paintings and Chinese paintings by major masters, and works by teachers and students from Xinhua Art College and Suzhou Art College, totaling thousands of pieces, were neatly produced and exquisitely crafted. The participants were enthusiastic and active, which is rare in the art world throughout history. It is reported that Mr. Ding Juntao, Sun Xueni, Hang Zhiying, Lin Kanghou, Wang Chang, Du Jinsheng, Wang Shourin, Ye Jianshu, Gu Tingkang, Chi Ning, Zhu Yazhen, Yan Wenliang, Xu Qu, and Li Yongsen have contributed the most to this initiative. After the last solicitation of winter clothing for refugee children achieved effective results, they have devoted themselves to relief efforts and fulfilled their responsibilities in their respective positions.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Asks by Telegraph to Allow the Transport of Casings to Shanghai, Handle it Like Bamboo and Wood</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, because the ban on the transport of casings to Shanghai is affecting exports, telegraphed the Ministry of Economic Affairs, stating that the annual sales of casings to Europe and the United States amount to 10 million yuan. In addition to local production in Shanghai, pig and sheep intestines are transported to Shanghai from Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and more than 5,000 workers rely on this for a living. Since last year, they have been included in the goods that should be settled for foreign exchange. Now that the transport is prohibited, they are滞留留 in Ningbo and Wenzhou, and they will rot and stink over time. This will not only consume foreign exchange settlement funds, but also cause workers to face unemployment. It is requested that they be handled in accordance with the six types of goods such as bamboo and wood. It is urgently requested that you send a telegram indicating your approval.</p>
<h3>The Public Works Department Stipulates the Method for Inspecting Rickshaws</h3>
<p>The rickshaw association of the special district held a meeting of representatives of the five districts on the evening of the 19th. More than 40 people, including Hou Shaodian, Wang Kunyi, and Zheng Jianquan, attended. Chairman Yin Zhiling led the discussion, and the results were as follows: (1) The refugee relief fee will continue to be paid, with a total of 2 jiao and 5 fen collected per month, including association fees. (2) The Public Works Department's regulations for inspecting vehicles may be difficult to implement, and it is instructed to make its own regulations, and send letters to all vehicle owners to fill in the forms. The announcement is recorded as follows: For the announcement, the Public Works Department's vehicle inspection office has notified that from April, the method for inspecting vehicles will be stipulated, with 9,500 vehicles being inspected in two months, and 2,375 vehicles being inspected every half month, etc., which has been approved by the association. The association believes that if the Public Works Department's vehicle inspection office controls the monthly inspection of rickshaws, it may be difficult for each vehicle merchant. In order to facilitate each vehicle merchant, a form has been printed and is enclosed with this letter. After receiving this form, each vehicle merchant should properly divide all vehicles into periods and fill in the form (if there are affiliated vehicles, they should be arranged according to the affiliation). The form should be sent to the association before the 25th of this month, and the association will compile and distribute it to the Public Works Department for inspection on schedule. This matter is for the convenience of each vehicle merchant, so do not delay. This is extremely important. This is a special announcement.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Economic Affairs Circular: Identify Japanese Goods Trademarks, Compile a Compilation of Japanese Goods Trademarks for Verification by Various Agencies and Organizations</h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, in order to enable trade associations and organizations to identify Japanese goods, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has instructed the Trademark Bureau to compile and print a "Compilation of Japanese Goods Trademarks," listing all registered Japanese trademarks, company names, commodities, registration approvals, or rejected company names, so that customs offices in various regions, provincial governments, and local competent authorities can follow them, and issued a Commercial Letter No. 22925 to instruct compliance. The original telegram and trademark names are recorded below.</p>
<p>Pay Attention to Trademarks when Banning Japanese Goods</p>
<p>According to the regulations in Article 2, paragraph 1, items 1 and 2, of the Regulations for the Prohibition of Japanese Goods, the goods should be investigated and announced by the Ministry in accordance with paragraph 2 of the same article. The Ministry has instructed the Trademark Bureau to investigate and clarify that the registered Japanese trademarks have been compiled into a "Compilation of Japanese Goods Trademarks." All Japanese goods, product names, and trademarks listed in the Compilation have been announced by the Ministry for prohibition. The Ministry and the Trademark Bureau have copies of the designs of the trademarks listed in the Compilation. If the executing agencies need to understand their structure and shape, or if they seize Japanese goods and need to verify the original designs for comparison and identification, they can inquire with the Ministry or the Trademark Bureau at any time. In addition to cabling the Ministry of Finance and the governments of various provinces, and instructing customs offices in various regions and local authorities to comply, we also enclose a copy of the Regulations for the Prohibition of Japanese Goods and a copy of the "Compilation of Japanese Goods Trademarks" for your information, and to inform various trade associations. Ministry of Economic Affairs (March 1, 1939)</p>
<p>Japanese Goods are Divided into Seventy-One Categories</p>

<h3>Government Allocates Five Million to Develop Sugar Cane, Hires Experts to Guide Planting and Orders Sugar Factories to Relocate Inland</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs, in order to develop the sugar industry, has hired American sugar industry experts to come to China to guide sugarcane planting and improve technology, and has allocated five million yuan for development. It has ordered sugar factories in Guangdong province to find ways to relocate inland. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Order to Relocate Sugar Factories Inland</p>
<p>Sugar is an essential part of daily diet, its function equivalent to salt, etc. Foreign sugar is imported annually in large quantities. For example, last year's imports were valued at 19,795,000 yuan. Since the establishment of sugar factories in Guangdong province, the quality of domestic sugar has been excellent and it has sold well throughout the country. Foreign sugar imports have decreased from over 80 million yuan to 20 million yuan. The Guangdong province sugar factories include those in Shitou, Xinzhao, Jieyang, Shunde, Dongguan, Pingtan, and other six locations. However, after the war, they were bombed by Japanese planes and forced to completely shut down. Now the Ministry of Economic Affairs has ordered the provincial government to find ways to relocate the provincial sugar factories inland to safe areas to resume production.</p>
<p>Government Allocates Funds for Sugar Industry Development</p>
<p>The soil of the southwestern provinces is fertile and the climate is mild, suitable for planting sugarcane. In order to develop the sugarcane industry, the government has allocated five million yuan in national currency for development. In addition to establishing sugar factories inland, it also encourages sugar farmers to use traditional methods to produce sugar, aiming to double production within five years. Besides meeting domestic needs, there will be surplus for export. It has hired sugar industry experts from Hawaii, USA to come to China to guide farmers in planting sugarcane, improve technology, and increase production. Because Chinese farmers are diligent in planting and labor costs are low, satisfactory results will definitely be achieved in the future.</p>
<p>Foreign Sugar Takes the Opportunity to Import and Dump</p>
<p>The quality of sugar from Guangdong province sugar factories is excellent, no different from imported products. Shanghai has always been the only major sales area. After the war, due to Japanese bombing, production was forced to shut down, leading to almost no domestic sugar being shipped to Shanghai. Foreign sugar took the opportunity to dump in the Shanghai market. As of the end of December last year, Shanghai's sugar inventory included 61,800 bags of Dutch coarse granulated sugar, 40,617 bags of Dutch brown sugar, 52,370 bags of Taikoo refined sugar, and 115,560 bags of domestic miscellaneous sugar, totaling 270,847 bags, an increase of 42,013 bags compared to the end of the previous year.</p>
<h3>Executive Director of Famine Relief Association, Baker, Returns to Shanghai after Inspecting North China Affairs</h3>
<p>Dr. Baker, the Executive Director of the China Foreign Famine Relief Association, went to North China on the 4th of this month to inspect the affairs of the Hebei and Shandong branches. After arriving in Beiping, he stayed briefly, discussing various agricultural benefit matters with the director of the association's Beiping office. Then, he immediately transferred from Tianjin to Jinan, inquiring and instructing about the Shandong branch's affairs. Now that the official business is completed, he returned to Shanghai from Qingdao by ship yesterday.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Management Policies for Shelters (Continued from Yesterday)</h3>
<p>There are a few more points to report to everyone:</p>
<p>(1) I hope everyone pays attention to today's notice, especially the eight creeds: (1) No favoritism, (2) No protectionism, (3) No self-interest, (4) No corruption, (5) No smoking, (6) No drinking, (7) No gambling, (8) No fighting.</p>
<p>The past is like yesterday's death. I hope that from now on, everyone will strictly abide by these creeds. Therefore, past mistakes, whether reprimanded or penalized, will be forgiven. However, if anyone violates the creeds again in the future, instead of being reprimanded or penalized, they will be dismissed directly without leniency. Because our colleagues' knowledge is higher than that of the refugees, how can we manage the refugees if we are not strict?</p>
<p>(2) Self-interest and corruption are not tolerated by the law. In order to prevent this precisely, the association has specially formulated measures for reporting and rewarding: (A) For those who report and are confirmed by the association's investigation, for corruption from one copper coin to one yuan in national currency, a reward of one yuan will be given. For those from one yuan to ten yuan, the reward will be the amount proven. For those above ten yuan, a discretionary commission will be awarded, and a merit will be recorded depending on the severity of the case. (B) If someone knows but does not report, and it is discovered and reported by a third party, the person covering up will be fined an amount equivalent to the reward given to the reporter according to clause A, to be given to the third-party reporter. (C) If there is concrete evidence of self-interest or corruption, legal action will be taken.</p>
<p>(3) After the meeting, please fill out and return the Type B personnel form. This form is specifically for evaluating service performance at the end of the shelter period, as a basis for introducing employment opportunities.</p>
<p>(4) In addition to direct inspections by personnel from the general management office of the association's shelters at any time, opinion boxes and informant boxes will be set up in each shelter so that refugees can report directly to the general management office at any time.</p>
<p>(5) The shelter stipulates that every Sunday is a holiday, but those in the same position must still take turns staying at the shelter. If someone needs to go out for personal matters or take sick leave, they must first obtain proof from the medical office. There are separate reward and salary deduction measures for holiday rest and frequent leave. (End)</p>
<h3>Broadway Mansions, Travelers Vacate Their Rooms, White Russian Staff To Be Dismissed</h3>
<p>After the Japanese bought the Broadway Mansions north of the Garden Bridge, yesterday morning, the Japanese brought a specially made large Japanese flag to the mansion and stored it on the fifth floor. After the handover is completed, it will be hung. Upon hearing this, most Western travelers stopped renting rooms yesterday, paid their bills, and left. It is said that both parties agreed not to make any changes to the Chinese and Western staff inside, but a group of White Russian clerks will be dismissed and replaced by Japanese.</p>
<h3>Refugee Population Statistics</h3>
<p>According to a report by the Public Works Department on the 19th of this month, 52 refugee shelters inspected by the department housed a total of 43,400 refugees.</p>

<h3>Haig Road Murder Case, Chen Tingsheng Assassinated</h3>
<p>Stabbed More Than Ten Times and Shot Once</p>
<p>Mortally Wounded and a Suspect Apprehended</p>
<p>The famous Shanghai gangster Chen Tingsheng, also known as Chen Xiaosanzi, 36 years old, from Zhenjiang, usually resided on Haig Road. He had a wife and concubine. His wife, Wang Guizhen, 34 years old this year, is the younger sister of Wang Xinda, the false "Chairman of the Maintenance Society" in Fahua, West Shanghai. His concubine, surnamed Cao, named Aliù, is only 16 years old this year, recently married. However, both Wang and Cao were illicitly associated and had not undergone formal marriage ceremonies. The workers in a certain Huakang paperboard factory on Gordon Road in West Shanghai mostly worshiped Chen</p>
<p>as their boss.</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the war two years ago, Chen and his wife and concubine moved to the two-story building and small room of Hu Haigen's house at 39 Haigeliy Road, in order to be close to Wang Xinda's home in Fahua and have someone to take care of them. Wang Guizhen lived in the building, and Cao Aliù lived in the small room. Chen spent the night with his wife and concubine alternately. The night before last, Chen spent the night with Wang in the building's room. At seven o'clock yesterday morning, the maid hired by Hu Haigen's family at the back door</p>
<p>was emptying the chamber pot</p>
<p>when suddenly four thugs arrived, each with a pistol and sharp blade, threatening the maid not to make any noise. After the maid retreated into the house in fright, one of the four thugs stood guard at the back door, and three of them rushed upstairs, entering Chen's room. At that time, Chen was sleeping in bed with Wang. He was awakened by the sound of footsteps on the stairs and intended to get up to inquire, but the thugs had already reached the window and took out a pistol, first aiming it at Chen's chest</p>
<p>and firing a shot.</p>
<p>The bullet hit the left chest, not penetrating. Then, Chen was violently stabbed seven or eight times in the right temple and right neck with a sharp blade. Chen tried to block with both hands, causing each hand to be stabbed once. Blood flowed freely. Seeing that their purpose had been achieved, the thugs swaggered downstairs and left. When Chen was shot and stabbed, his wife, Wang, was petrified and dared not make a sound. After the thugs left, she was able to calm down. At that time, Chen's injuries were already serious</p>
<p>and he was dying.</p>
<p>The family reported to the French police, who immediately sent Chinese and Western detectives to investigate. An ambulance was called immediately and took Chen to Guangci Hospital, but it was too late. He died on the way. After arriving at the hospital, the doctor examined the body and sent it to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall for autopsy, awaiting a court inspection today. The most serious and fatal injuries were the bullet wound in the chest and the three stab wounds in the right neck. The police sent personnel to take detailed photos of the injured parts of the deceased, in order to have them available for future investigation when the murderer is apprehended. It is also heard that the deceased's</p>
<p>concubine, Guizhen,</p>
<p>was extremely promiscuous. There are two rumored reasons for Chen's sudden murder: oxygen deficiency and political reasons. The police have taken the deceased's wife and concubine into custody for investigation, in order to apprehend the criminals and punish them according to law. Another account says that Chen had heard of actions unfavorable to him three or four days ago and intended to move his residence, but his brother-in-law, Wang Xinda, dissuaded him and guaranteed his safety.</p>
<p>One Criminal Apprehended</p>
<p>(Additional News) When French police detectives were inspecting Chen's residence, in addition to finding a bullet casing and a letter left by the thugs in the room, they also found the murder weapon in the garbage can at Haigeliy. At about 4:00 PM, Inspector Jiang Futian, Detective Shen Jinshui, and others apprehended a Tao, who is said to be a major suspect in the case, at the Yile Tianhuang venue on Xujiahui Road.</p>
<h3>Robbery at Cotton Mill, Chinese Constable Killed, More Than Thirty Gang Members Arrested</h3>
<p>Seven Other Criminals Temporarily Detained by Japanese Headquarters</p>
<p>Head Constable Theft Case Also Solved</p>
<p>Four Stolen Pistols Handed Over to the Court</p>
<p>At 11:15 AM on the first of this month, the Anle Cotton Mill opened by Deng Zhonghe at 34A Bailinan Road in West Shanghai was suddenly invaded by several armed bandits who robbed 2,695 yuan in legal tender. When fleeing, they encountered Chinese Constable No. 2067 from the Jing'an Temple Police Station. The gang opened fire, killing the constable, and escaped with the loot. The Public Concession Police paid close attention to the case, considering the gang's audacity to kill a Chinese constable with gunfire.</p>
<p>Bold and Reckless</p>
<p>They ordered all police stations to strictly investigate. Until 9:30 PM on the 18th of this month, Jing'an Temple Police Station Chinese Detectives Wang Jinsheng, Qi Mengqing, Yao Changmin, and others learned that some of the bandits in this case were hiding in a shed on Jiaozhou Road. They joined Chinese Inspector Tang Jian, Wu Chengmo, Western Inspector Glenfey, and others to secretly go to the address and arrested four Jiangbei people, including Jiang Shouming. They also seized a Mauser rifle and seven bullets. Then, they went to 28 Robertsun Road and arrested four accomplices. Except for Jiang Shouming, who was brought back to the police station, the other seven were temporarily detained at</p>
<p>the Japanese Headquarters.</p>
<p>Later, they went to 284 Rongqingli, Xiaoshadu Road, and successively arrested thirty-five people, including Jiangbei people Zhang Fucai, Lü Wensheng, Xu Ganjun, Wang Linfang, Chen Bingquan, Wang Fusheng, Lu Zuo Fu, Zhu Asan, Liu Shoushan, Cao Zhenyu, Sun Renjie, Xu Kejin, Li Mingchen, Wei Burong, Zhang Decai, Lu Caipu, Wang Asan, Li Yuezhi, Sun Dongfu, Fan Lunzi, Zhou Dingzhi, Song Wencai, Shao Yide, Zhao Tongxia, Ningbo native Fu Yongshu, Chen Benlai, Jin Amao, Yangzhou native Li Zhenwu, Changzhou native Ji Zhigen, Zhejiang native Wu Ajin, Jiangbei people Zhou Detou, Xu Zhaolin, Xu Weibao, Wu Wengong, Mao Jinhong, and others.</p>
<p>Thirty-five people</p>
<p>were taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, along with Jiang Shouming and others, a total of thirty-six people were handed over to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police Lawyer Li Zhishan presented the case and requested permission to detain them. Judge Xiao granted the detention and ordered a further hearing on April 4.</p>
<p>Yao Jiagui, the Chinese head detective of the Jing'an Temple Police Station, whose home is at 339 Daxi Road, West Shanghai, was suddenly invaded by several armed bandits on the 6th of this month, who robbed more than a thousand yuan in property and also took all of Yao's</p>
<p>pistols and bullets</p>
<p>before escaping. Now, Chinese detectives Xie Zhiguang, Zhao Lianbi, Xu Yongyuan, and others from the Diswei Road Police Station learned that some of the bandits in this case were hiding in the Yuyuan Road and Difeng Road area in West Shanghai. Yesterday afternoon at 5:30 PM, they secretly went there with the Western Inspector and arrested three locals, Xu Yongquan (also known as Yougen), Shandong native Wang Yushan (also known as Wen Haiquan, also known as Xiaoshandong), and Suzhou native Zhu Yunlong. They found bank passbooks, four rings, four watches, three pairs of glasses, and a pen on each person. Then, they went to 557 Hed Road</p>
<p>to the Darui Hospital</p>
<p>and arrested Chongming native Shen Yougen. They also seized a passbook totaling more than 900 yuan. Later, they learned that firearms were hidden in 9 Zhujiazhai and 2 Wujiazhai in West Shanghai. They first went to Zhujiazhai and seized a pistol and four bullets. It was found that the pistol was formerly the property of the Public Security Bureau. Then, they went to Wujiazhai and arrested a Guangdong native Chen Haibin (also known as Xiaoguangdong). They also seized a Mauser rifle and two pistols, one of which belonged to Yao, the</p>
<p>constable who was robbed.</p>
<p>There were twenty-eight bullets. Finally, at the intersection of Jiaozhou Road and Xinzha Road, they captured Ningbo native Wang Xianghong (also known as Fu Ke). The above-mentioned six people, along with four pistols and stolen goods, were taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police Lawyer Li Zhishan stated the circumstances of the case and requested permission to detain them. Judge Xiao briefly questioned Xu Yongquan and others and ordered them to be detained pending further investigation.</p>

<h3>Husband with Mental Disorder, Young Wife Dies by Poisoning</h3>
<p>Wife's Family Launches an Inquisition</p>
<p>Demanding Compensation from Husband's Family</p>
<p>Qu Zhou Shi, a local woman living at 6 Zhenhua Li, Malang Road in the French Concession, her husband operates a large carpentry business, accumulated over 100,000 yuan, and has a son, 25 years old this year, a high school graduate, with a mental disorder. He was married once before, but the young couple had a bad relationship. After agreeing to divorce the year before last, in September last year, he remarried the daughter of Yang Ma Shi, a porcelain merchant from 3 Baxianfang, Baxianqiao, (19 years old this year). However, for more than four months since the marriage, there was no affection between the young couple, causing Yang Shi to feel that life was meaningless and there was no hope for future happiness. She returned to her mother's home on the 7th of this month. After being picked up by her husband at noon on the 19th, Yang Shi had a momentary lapse of judgment and took poison to commit suicide. At 3:30 PM, Qu Zhou Shi discovered this and sent her to Guangci Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. She died at 5:00 PM. The hospital reported this to the French police, who took the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall for an autopsy. Yesterday, Prosecutor Wang Ren from the Second Special District Court arrived to verify the cause of death. The deceased's aunt, Qu Zhou Shi, claimed the body. Upon hearing the news, the wife's family launched an inquisition, negotiating with the husband's family, demanding that the funeral be conducted with high-quality burial clothes and a camphor coffin, that Buddhist scriptures be recited every seven days for her soul's salvation, and demanding 10,000 yuan in compensation. It is said that the husband's family has agreed to accept and will send the body to the funeral home for encoffining.</p>
<h3>Major Losses in Fire at Children's Middle School and No. 32 Shelter</h3>
<p>All Houses Destroyed, Two Refugees Dead</p>
<p>Total of Fourteen Students and Refugees Injured</p>
<p>Doing Our Best to Handle Aftermath, Will Be Able to Recover in Short Time</p>
<p>The Children's Middle School and the No. 32 Shelter, both sponsored by the Shanghai Refugee Relief Branch on Aidoa Road, were unfortunately hit by a fire at around 1:00 AM yesterday morning. The school building and shelter, including a large shed made of reeds and three smaller sheds, as well as a hall in Xuyuan Park, were all destroyed. According to eyewitnesses, the fire started on the roof of the east end of the large shed, which was next to a wall fence with no houses nearby. Therefore, the cause of the fire is difficult to guess. After the incident, the association sent personnel to investigate. It is estimated that one (male) and one (female) refugees were burned to death. Two students suffered serious facial injuries, and six refugees and students each suffered minor injuries. The bodies of the deceased were taken by the police to the autopsy. The injured were given minor surgery by the health team and sent to the relief hospital for treatment. All the remaining refugees and students were accommodated on the original site. It is estimated that the various losses, including equipment, books, and construction costs, amounted to several thousand yuan. The association's vice-director, Shen Yanfang, has instructed the general affairs and shelter groups to do their best to handle the aftermath and restore the original state in the shortest possible time.</p>
<h3>Due to Guerrilla Warnings, Gambling Dens and Opium Dens Move to Hongkou</h3>
<p>Six Establishments Have Already Relocated</p>
<p>Guerrillas Personally Ordered Closure</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News reports that gambling dens and opium dens in the Western District are now gradually moving to Hongkou and North Sichuan Road. Six establishments have already relocated there. This is because a large number of Chinese guerrillas have appeared in the Western District. Under orders from their superiors, they threatened to take action against gambling dens and opium dens. It was further learned yesterday that the guerrillas posted notices in the Western District on Sunday, denouncing the traitors and bandits who set up these establishments and advising them not to be used by the enemy any longer. Otherwise, they would be severely punished after being captured. The notice was signed by the leader, surnamed Guo. The fact that the notice was signed by the leader shows that there are several other guerrilla teams in Shanghai. The notice also stated that the team specialized in dealing with all gambling dens and opium dens, and would closely cooperate with other friendly forces to eliminate all local evils. In addition to posting notices, they also sent written warnings to various gambling dens such as Hollywood and Rong Sheng Company. These gambling dens are equipped with luxuriously decorated opium rooms. It is said that armed guerrillas went to the gambling dens, ordering them to close, coming and going freely without any worries.</p>
<h3>Ling Qihong, the False "President of the High Court" in Hankou, An Upstart</h3>
<p>Chen Guocai Fills Position as False "Chief Prosecutor"</p>
<p>Ling Qihong, a Wu native who was formerly the president of the Beiping Lawyers Association, engaged in legal work after coming to Shanghai. When the War of Resistance broke out, Ling immediately fawned on a certain party, hoping to seize the Shanghai First Special District Court. However, thanks to the upholding of justice by various countries and the maintenance of the integrity of Chinese legal rights in the concession, Ling's high hopes were dashed. Later, through the recommendation of a certain party, Ling was appointed as the false "Director of the Social Affairs Bureau of the Shanghai Municipal Government." However, this position could not satisfy Ling's desires. After Hankou fell, Ling again lobbied everywhere, hoping to obtain the position of "President of the High Court" in Hankou. Now his wish has been fulfilled. He has been appointed by a certain party as the president of the "Hankou High Court" and concurrently the "President of the District Court." Ling went to Hankou on the first of this month to "take office." A few days ago, Ling secretly came to Shanghai from Hankou and hid in Room 318 of the Broadway Mansions in Hongkou, gathering his staff and assigning various false positions. The general puppets also held banquets to celebrate. As for the position of false High Court "Chief Prosecutor", Ling has recommended his confidant, Chen Guocai (former lawyer, who once served as the "Presiding Judge of the Civil Court of the False Shanghai District Court"), the false "Chief of the Second Section of the Social Affairs Bureau". Chen has completed the arrangements for his boat tickets and passes after being entrusted with the false position, and will soon go to Hankou to disgrace himself.</p>
<h3>Japanese Enter Qishan Middle School Twice</h3>
<p>Visiting the Principal Without Meeting</p>
<p>Motives Still Difficult to Ascertain</p>
<p>336 Gordon Road in the Public Concession is the location of Huiling Middle School. Recently, since Qishan Middle School in Zhejiang Province moved to Shanghai to hold classes, and Huiling happened to have surplus school buildings, Qishan Middle School leased part of its school buildings for classrooms. On the morning of the 13th of this month, when the classrooms were in session, it was learned that a Japanese person in plain clothes, accompanied by a Chinese person in plain clothes, suddenly went to visit the principal. At that time, the principal was out and the teachers were busy teaching, so they did not speak to them and left. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the day before yesterday (the 18th), Saturday, two Japanese military police officers and police officers from the police station jointly went to the school. It is learned that only the Japanese military police directly entered the school at the time, but because the principal had not returned to school, they just glanced at the classrooms before leaving. However, before leaving, it is said that they saw them copying down the door numbers and other things. Their intentions are unknown.</p>
<h3>Electrical Engineer Chen Zhixian Passes Away</h3>

<h3>A Review of Men's Health After Marriage</h3>
<p>What does life seek? To be without illness is to be as a god!</p>
<p>To be physically weakened after marriage is the most tragic of sufferings!</p>
<p>Because there are many classmates, friends, and relatives and neighbors with whom we played together when we were young, and they all seemed to be in good health. But once they got married, before long, most of them were in a state of decline. Not only was their ambition depressed, no longer as proactive as in the past, but several people even died due to illness. The passing of old friends truly saddens me! Because I study medicine, it has further aroused my motivation to review the issue of men's health after marriage.</p>
<p>Does married life ultimately affect health? The answer to this question can be described as "everyone has their own opinion." But in summary, it boils down to two sides: positive and negative. Some say that marriage is detrimental to health. If a man does not marry and forever maintains his virginity, he can enjoy longevity. However, those who refute him say that in fact, one only sees that the lifespan of men who marry late is shorter than that of married men. Although unmarried monks may enjoy longevity, in reality, can an adult man remain unmarried? Therefore, there are those who generally say that marriage is beneficial to health, because the male and female sexes are innate instincts that are inherent and manifest their function in due course. If this function is overly suppressed, it will cause physiological obstacles. The most common phenomenon among men who marry late is hysteria and neurasthenia. According to the medical scientist James, "A man who has not married after the age of twenty-eight is somewhat neurotic." At first, we did not believe it, but after careful observation of the facts, we realized that his words were true. We have also learned from research in biology that some animals die because they cannot find a mate. Therefore, marriage is a necessary thing in our lives that cannot be avoided. As long as a man is pure in heart and abstemious before marriage, preserving his virginity, and can observe the principles of hygiene in married life after marriage, then the love between husband and wife can last forever, and they can spend their sweet life, bearing clever children, and organizing a happy family. In this way, not only can their health be improved, but their happiness in life will be enriched. It is truly what is called "many blessings, many years, and many sons." However, if a young man commits masturbation, nocturnal emission, or unrestrained licentiousness after marriage, he will inevitably develop spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, dissipation of energy, and neurasthenia. In this way, not only will he suffer from many illnesses and shorten his lifespan, but also he will not be able to coordinate in married life, often causing his wife to hate him, and staging all kinds of tragedies in the family! When it comes to this point, the problem becomes more serious and complicated. The only remedy, according to world-renowned doctors and my experience, is to take the gonadotropin preparation "Sheng Zhi Su," which is the most appropriate and effective treatment. This agent is made by scientifically replicating the gonadotropin extracted from the bodies of strong animals, so it is pure in quality and effective, and its tonic power is positive, which is unmatched by other glandular preparations. After taking it, it can produce sperm and tonify the kidneys, strengthen the brain and activate blood circulation, and nourish the nerves in one day and night. If it can be taken continuously and persistently, then it will be possible to completely cure the above symptoms in a short period of time. Only those with spermatorrhea must also take "Himi Tuo Shi's Zhou Jing Pian" to strengthen the sperm gate and stop leakage, so that the effect will be even faster!</p>
<p>Health and Beauty</p>
<h3>The Value of Breasts in Women's Health and Beauty</h3>
<p>— Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>It's not about boosting others' morale and diminishing our own prestige, but Western women are indeed more healthy and beautiful than Chinese women. Not only do they have firm chests and high breasts in their youth, and large hips, they have a majestic and high-spirited air about them when they walk. Even some older women, although their hair has turned white, their breasts are still so high, and have not withered. Therefore, the children they give birth to are also particularly intelligent and clever, and the physique of the people is also particularly strong.</p>
<p>According to the research results of world-renowned beauty expert and physiologist Kang Delin, and gynecological expert Tang Posheng, etc., they believe that the higher and more elastic a woman's breasts are, not only in terms of beauty, can they form the most mysterious curve with the hips and waist, making every man who sees it feel good, but also because of the soundness of their own ovarian function, the vigorous metabolism, their temperament is invariably open-minded and gentle, their muscles are invariably crystal clear and white, and their thoughts are invariably keen and meticulous. Even when faced with difficult problems, they can analyze them in a methodical manner, and will not feel overwhelmed. In addition, because of the smooth blood circulation, a peach-like smile appears on their faces, and even without makeup, they are extremely beautiful. Although age increases, youth remains, and the relationship between the sexes is infinitely sweet, organizing a happy and fulfilling family, and bearing strong and lively children. How great is the contribution of such women to the country and to the family! However, in the past, if the breasts were withered and the hips were thin due to chest binding, masturbation, irregular menstruation, leucorrhea and other symptoms, and health and beauty were lost, then not only would they be sick and in pain as virgins, with no beautiful and moving posture, but also once married, they would be disgusted by their husbands because of their lack of sex appeal and the above-mentioned defects, and even abandoned. The only remedy is to take the ovarian preparation "Sheng Zhi Su" for women to nourish essence and blood, so that the ovarian function is sound and the metabolism is vigorous. Then not only can the above symptoms be completely cured, but also the breasts can be raised, the cheeks can be rosy, and health and beauty can be improved.</p>
<h3>Nocturnal Emission and Masturbation are the Demons of Youth</h3>
<p>— Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist</p>
<p>Perhaps this is a deformed pathology of society! In this extraordinary period of thrift and national salvation, this isolated island is still filled with bright lights and debauchery, full of nets of eroticism and lasciviousness. Generally, young people who are just developing are in this tempting environment, not to mention that their hearts are also yearning for all the secrets between the sexes, preparing to explore what exactly is going on. However, on the one hand, because they are plagued by economic constraints and the terror of venereal diseases, they dare not openly engage in prostitution. But on the other hand, they cannot break free from the temptation of romance. Therefore, they have no choice but to seek the next best thing, and begin to commit masturbation.</p>
<p>After a young man commits masturbation, even if his thoughts are usually rich, his memory is strong, and his physique is strong, he will unconsciously degenerate during this period. If he suffers from nocturnal emission, spermatorrhea, and leakage of sperm due to masturbation, then at this time, not only will your developmental function stagnate, you will become underdeveloped, sallow and emaciated, and prematurely senile, which is what is called a "little old man"! This kind of "little old man" will accomplish nothing in learning and career because of the lack of brainpower and physical strength. Moreover, because of kidney deficiency and incompetence, and dissipation of energy, he will also destroy the happiness in his future married life! However, how can his wife continue to waste her youth in this way? Therefore, it is common for all kinds of tragedies to be staged in the family!</p>
<p>Regarding the treatment of nocturnal emission, although there are many advertisements on the market today, the most effective, according to world-renowned doctors and my many years of experience, is to take "Himi Tuo Shi's Gu Jing Pian." This agent can not only consolidate the sperm gate, but also calm the nerves, so that young people with neurasthenia can get sleep. Therefore, dreams are reduced, and there is no more mental turmoil, so that nocturnal emission can be cured. Only those whose nocturnal emission has already caused the above symptoms must also take the gonadotropin preparation "Sheng Zhi Su" to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase essence and blood, and nourish the nerves. If it can be taken continuously, it will definitely be possible to fully restore health in a short period of time.</p>

<h3>Lymphogranuloma Venereum in Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>Lymphogranuloma venereum caused by gonorrhea is relatively rare, but general physicians with little experience often think that this is caused by mixing with other bacteria, or even think that it is another kind of lymphogranuloma venereum that has nothing to do with gonorrhea. This is a big mistake. It is necessary for astute physicians to make agile diagnoses and correct treatments. Lymphogranuloma venereum caused by gonorrhea has fewer chances of suppuration than the general type, but if it is misdiagnosed, or even rashly treated like other lymphogranuloma venereum by cutting it open, it is easier to worsen. Of course, lymphogranuloma venereum caused by gonorrhea also has times when it suppurates, and of course there are also times when it needs to be cut open. But it is no longer the best policy for treating lymphogranuloma venereum caused by gonorrhea. The best treatment is to quickly cure lymphogranuloma venereum caused by gonorrhea when it has not yet suppurated. It is most suitable and can reduce the infinite pain of the patient.</p>
<p>Originally, lymphogranuloma venereum caused by gonorrhea is the result of a reaction in the struggle between gonococci and lymphocyte cells in the lymph glands, so in treatment, we must not ignore the rampant gonococci, and handle them well. The patient's inguinal lines on both sides are enlarged and painful, and there may be fever and chills. The treatment method is to use cold compresses to apply to the swollen lymph glands, or apply anti-inflammatory drugs, and intravenous injections to make them dissipate. If it has already suppurated, then perform surgery quickly. In surgical terms, the larger the opening, the better, so that all the pus can be discharged at once. Avoid using a needle to make a small hole, so that the pus drips endlessly, which may become dangerous as a fistula. The gonococci hiding in the prostate, anterior and posterior urethra, etc., still need to be removed completely with the German "Filtration, No Flow" electrical therapy and prostate massage, so that the lymphogranuloma venereum, which generally frightens patients, can be completely and fundamentally resolved. However, such patients are often mistreated by inexperienced and unknowledgeable physicians. For example, last month there was a Qian family patient who suffered from this disease and was mistreated by another doctor. He begged me for treatment and was cured.</p>
<p>Specialties: Also treats syphilis, lymphogranuloma venereum, chancroid, and painless new method for circumcision.</p>

<h3>Fire on Rue Paul Beau in the French Concession, Exact Number of Children Killed Unclear, Fierce Fire Only Extinguished This Morning</h3>
<p>A fire broke out on Rue Paul Beau in the French Concession, at the intersection of Rue Glandaz and Rue Paul Beau and Rue Baron Gros, at around 11:10 last night. The area was originally flat ground. Along Rue Paul Beau, bamboo fences were used as mud walls. Behind it was connected to De Sheng Lane, and to the right was connected to Ji Yi Lane. The interior was rented to the Sino-French Coal Factory and bamboo and lumber companies, etc., as material storage yards. The area connected to De Sheng Lane was covered with several flat houses for use as workshops. One of the rooms was rented to a certain bamboo ware workshop. Unexpectedly, at around 11:00 last night, a fire suddenly broke out in the workshop. Bamboo materials are easily flammable, so in a moment, it spread to the surrounding area. The flames soared into the sky, becoming uncontrollable. The French Concession Fire Department received the news and immediately dispatched fire trucks to put out the fire. However, the southeast wind was very strong, and all the water pipes were ineffective. The fire was gradually expanding, even burning the houses in De Sheng Lane. The fire darted here and there, making it impossible to get started. The residents inside and nearby who were affected by the disaster were awakened from their dreams. Because the fire was pressing, they could not salvage anything and had to flee for their lives. For a time, the cries of men and women and the cries of children were mixed together, and the order was chaotic. Most of them only managed to grab one or two quilts, and used them to keep warm while sleeping on the streets. The situation was extremely tragic. As of the time the reporter was writing, it was 12:30 this morning, and the fire seemed to have subsided slightly, but it still needed to be completely extinguished. It was also learned that two or three children had died in the fire because they could not escape. The girl who started the fire also did not escape. But because the fire had not yet been extinguished, there was no way to search, so the details still need to be reported later.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor, It was recently reported that Gu Sheng rented out his residence on Yuguan Road to open a gambling den. However, what was reported is not true. However, because the world is a dangerous game and people are cunning, I am afraid that someone will use this news to achieve their illegal attempts, and even more that villains will misunderstand the rumors, arousing covetousness. Therefore, I have no choice but to briefly explain the circumstances of this matter. Gu Sheng has no huge property, let alone ready cash. Since September 18, he has suffered repeated blows from the sluggish market. In order to reduce the standard of living and barely support the household, he entrusted a leasing agency to rent out his own residence, so that he could move to a smaller house to reduce expenses. This is entirely for personal economic reasons. After seeing the reports, he checked the contents of the lease with the leasing agency and learned that the conditions stated were all in accordance with the usual leasing practices in Shanghai and did not violate any laws. Moreover, the lease was drafted by the Tongren Law Firm, and the amount of rent was also determined according to the current rental prices of the same type of houses. There was no such thing as reported. Gu Sheng had already authorized others in advance, and there was no possibility of interference afterwards. Moreover, I believe that I have always been self-respecting, and my actions in life will be judged fairly. I have no room for praise or criticism. However, I am afraid that misinformation will breed misunderstandings. I dare to ask the newspaper to publish this letter in the Letter to the Editor section to correct the record and clarify the truth. I am extremely grateful. Sincerely, He Gusheng, March 20, 1939</p>
<p>To the Editor, According to Mr. Liu Zheran, the party concerned, he claimed to our office that he recently read in today's newspaper that the soil trafficker Jiang Yumen colluded with Liu Zheran, etc., to organize a general opium sales bureau in Western Shanghai, with Liu as the deputy manager, etc. He was shocked to read it. I am currently serving at the American Casey Foreign Company, and have no other business. Moreover, I do not know Jiang Yumen at all. The report is obviously a false rumor. The matter concerns my reputation. Please ask your lawyer to send a letter to the newspaper to quickly correct it in order to clarify the matter, etc. Accordingly, we hereby inform you of the situation and hope that you will investigate and correct it. Sincerely, Lawyer Chen Tingrui, March 20</p>
<p>Correction: Yesterday, this newspaper reported on the situation of the Fudan Alumni Association holding a celebration for Mr. Ma Xiangbo's 100th birthday at the Xin Xin Restaurant. There were slight discrepancies in the facts. (1) Mr. Xia Jiancheng's speech was a congratulatory speech on behalf of the guests. (2) Mr. Zhang Chongren, Ma's grandson, represented him. This is to correct the record.</p>

<h3>The Recent Trends of Tuberculosis</h3>
<p>— Ding Huikang</p>
<p>If we wish to prevent the occurrence of a disease, we must not only study its causes, but also pay attention to its growth and decline, its historical changes, and its relationship to human geography. In the industrialized areas of European countries, the mortality rate from tuberculosis has gradually decreased due to the gradual improvement of their sanitation facilities. In Germany, the number of deaths per 10,000 residents has decreased from 12% to 7.5%, which is due to the public insurance system and the progress of public health. In the recent century, Norway had the lowest tuberculosis mortality rate in 1910, followed by Denmark, and in 1920, the mortality rate in the Netherlands was even lower than that of Norway. After the war, the statistics of Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Germany all showed a decrease in mortality rates.</p>
<p>Recent observations indicate that Germany has a lower tuberculosis mortality rate than other countries, making it the country with the lowest tuberculosis mortality rate in Europe and the world. Canada's tuberculosis statistics are very high, with a mortality rate seven and a half times higher than that of other ethnic groups. In British Australia, the age of tuberculosis infection is very late. The situation of tuberculosis in India is relatively poor, with a very high mortality rate, with 30 deaths per 10,000 people each year. In Italy, the density of residents in cities, the lack of open squares and gardens, and the excessively small workplaces are all major causes of the spread of tuberculosis. In Nordic countries and the Netherlands, the annual number of deaths is less than the number of beds in national hospitals. In the United Kingdom, the United States, and Germany, the number of deaths and hospital beds are almost the same. In France, there are two deaths per hospital bed. In Italy, there are five deaths per hospital bed. The number of deaths has decreased since 1925, and by 1930, tuberculosis statistics had decreased by 32%. The anti-tuberculosis work in Italy is carried out by the Fascist government, and the implementation of compulsory tuberculosis insurance has achieved excellent results. The tuberculosis mortality rate in France is also relatively high. Although the organization of the "anti-tuberculosis diagnosis and treatment network" is very complete, its results are not yet fully satisfactory. Generally speaking, France often maintains the highest tuberculosis mortality rate among European countries. The mortality rate in Belgium is relatively safe. In Switzerland, the tuberculosis mortality rate is not significantly reduced compared to the total number of deaths, and it is also higher than other European countries such as Austria, Hungary, Ireland, and Finland. The age of death is mostly in childhood. In Southern European countries such as Romania and Greece, tuberculosis mortality rates are high. The climate in Hungary is harsh, and the construction of houses is very difficult, so tuberculosis in that country can be called a residential disease. In Northern Europe, tuberculosis mortality rates are relatively safe, such as in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. The tuberculosis mortality rate in Norway has also decreased. In 1929, there were 15.6 deaths per 10,000 residents, ranking eleventh compared to civilized countries. The tuberculosis mortality rate in Denmark is very safe, with 6.3% in cities and 7.5% nationwide, the lowest tuberculosis mortality rate in the world. Statistics throughout Russia are inconsistent. Currently, the tuberculosis mortality rate of the Russian ethnic group is higher than that of other ethnic groups in the Soviet Union, but it is lower in eastern Siberia. Tuberculosis statistics in North America show that the peak of mortality is closely related to population density. At the beginning of this century, the United States ranked first in tuberculosis mortality, but today it has fallen to sixth place. Michigan has a greater reduction compared to the southern states. In Cleveland, in 1930, there were only 8.3 deaths per 10,000 residents. This degree of mortality reduction cannot be achieved by people of color. In Mexico, the tuberculosis mortality rate has also decreased in recent years. The tuberculosis mortality rates in Argentina and Brazil in South America are very high due to poor public health. In the Philippines, the tuberculosis mortality rate in 1930 was 305.5 per 10,000 residents. Japan and China have similarities with the above situations, but it should be noted that the mortality rates within each region are not the same. Tuberculosis is less common in northern and western China, while tuberculosis is more common in central and southern China. In the past century, most black people have migrated to the Americas and become part of the "Scots-Irish" population. In the United States, statistics show that the mortality rate for white people is 7.2 per 10,000 residents, while the mortality rate for people of color is 23.3, which is three times higher than that of white people, a phenomenon that tuberculosis experts call racial hypersensitivity. In 45 major cities in the United States, the mortality rate has decreased significantly, averaging 8.13 per 10,000 people, with Chicago only having 6.6, but the rate for black people is 40. The reasons for this racial difference are difficult to solve, but the overall situation of the population is certainly related. The situation of tuberculosis in "rural areas" is as follows: a report from the Health Organization of the League of Nations proves that the highest tuberculosis mortality rate is in agricultural areas with underdeveloped industries, but most scholars still believe that the transmission of tuberculosis is generally less common in rural areas. What is most noteworthy is that people who move from rural areas to cities often experience severe illness within the first two years, especially young people. The relationship between tuberculosis mortality and "age" is as follows: according to German statistics, between the ages of 30 and 70, the rates for both sexes are almost equal. Between the ages of 5 and 30, the rate for women is higher than that for men. Furthermore, the mortality rate for school-age children has also been gradually decreasing. What needs to be noted is that new infections among girls are more common in schools than among boys. At the same time, it proves that the transmission of tuberculosis does not occur in the earliest years of childhood, but at a higher age. As for the reasons for the reduction of transmission, the most important are the improvement of school facilities and the immediate isolation after the discovery of cases. Recent studies on the infection of school-age children indicate that the infection is mostly due to family transmission, and the rate of infection from schools is very low. In large-scale examinations, 1% to 13% of university students are found to have tuberculosis, and there is also a tendency for active tuberculosis to increase. The relationship between occupation and tuberculosis is such that those who are most susceptible to infection are of course nurses and doctors. This special occupation is indeed more dangerous than others. In addition, those who inhale large amounts of dust, such as shoemakers and tailors, also have a higher infection rate. In northern Italy, it was found that 10% of residents over the age of 60 had tuberculosis, belonging to the open type. According to German statistics on open tuberculosis, the annual mortality statistics should be multiplied by at least three. For example, if the German mortality rate in 1932 was 7.5 per 100,000 people, multiplying it by three would be 22.5. Based on the country's population, this would be 146,250 people. The average lifespan of such open tuberculosis patients is three years, making them a major cause of family transmission. Furthermore, what is noteworthy about tuberculosis between "spouses" is that male patients are more likely to infect their healthy wives, because women often have pregnancy and childbirth-related factors, or because they exert themselves to care for their husbands, thus making them more susceptible to infection. However, tuberculosis between spouses is not as terrifying as one might imagine, because those who marry are mostly past the most dangerous period of susceptibility. According to recent world literature and statistics, countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, and Germany have achieved very satisfactory results in tuberculosis prevention, with a mortality rate of only 7 or 8 per 10,000 people. Although France and Switzerland have also made great efforts in tuberculosis prevention, they still have a higher mortality rate. In short, the transmission of tuberculosis in various countries is still very severe, and without sufficient economic resources, the success of its prevention will still be very difficult. What we urgently need to pay attention to in the future is the organizational methods of "unemployment insurance" and "health insurance", which are the greatest force in reducing tuberculosis mortality rates. The next step is the popularization of "X-ray diagnosis" and the improvement of "compression therapy", so that everyone understands that tuberculosis has no specific medicine in modern medical attacks, and long-term medication can instead increase the disease mechanism. The spread of tuberculosis in our country is a tragic result of superstitious medication and conditioning. Looking at the success of tuberculosis prevention in various countries, there is no other way.</p>
<p>Physiological Hygiene Talks</p>
<h3>General Physiological Knowledge and Physiological Hygiene Regarding Muscles and Bones</h3>
<p>— Fan Shouyuan</p>
<p>Everyone knows that muscles and bones are the most important basic tissues in the human body's organizational system. General knowledge about these two human tissue systems, as well as hygienic knowledge on how to care for them, should also be noted by the general public. Now, I will separately write out a little general knowledge about these two organizational systems, which I think will also be needed by the general readers.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about bones.</p>
<p>The common name for bones is "bones." There are many bones in the human body, acting as the framework that supports the human body. The general name for these many bones in the human body is the "skeleton." If the human body did not have these bones, all the soft tissues attached to the bones, such as skin, muscles, etc., would have nowhere to be placed. In terms of function, it would not only be impossible to walk and move, but also impossible to stand upright. At the same time, many organs that rely on it for protection, such as the brain and spinal cord, would also completely lose their means of protection. Therefore, because the human body has bones, the organizational organs of the entire body have a place to entrust, and can be constructed into a human body.</p>
<p>The physiological function of bones was just mentioned in passing: (1) They are the position that supports the human body, allowing it to stand upright without falling; (2) They can make the human body move: actions such as walking and working cannot be done without bones as the main body; (3) They are the protectors of many important organizational organs in the human body: the most obvious examples are the skull bones protecting the brain, the vertebrae bones protecting the spinal cord, the eye socket bones protecting the eyeballs, and so on. As for their shape, they are quite inconsistent: there are strips, and the lengths of the sticks are not uniform, like pen tips and pen holders, such as the upper and lower limb bones; there are pieces, the sizes of which are not the same, like wood and stones, for example, the vertebrae bones belong to this type of shape: there are flat tiles, and there are many bones of this type of shape on the skull; and there are slender and curved shapes like bows, the ribs that surround the chest and back in the middle. In addition, of course, there are various other shapes, which need not be mentioned much here.</p>
<p>Changing the direction of the conversation, let's still turn back to talk about its hygiene.</p>
<p>The hygiene of bones seems to be not very noticeable on the surface, but in fact, it is also very important. For example, for the head and face, how should they be protected well so that they are not hit or touched with excessive force. Otherwise, if the skull is injured, it will lightly damage the brain and severely cause death. In the past, old-style private school teachers in our country punished students by hitting their heads with a hard ruler at every turn, which is a very inappropriate act from a hygienic point of view. Also, the pillows used when sleeping should not be made of overly hard materials: the sleeping time should also not be spent exclusively on one side, to prevent the skull from deforming and affecting the brain. (This should be paid special attention to in infancy and childhood!) As for young people in their reading years, the most important thing in terms of bone hygiene seems to be the spinal bones. If reading and writing are the daily work of young students, but if they do not pay attention to the uprightness of the sitting position when reading and writing, it is easy to affect the spinal bones, and gradually make them become curved. Young students often make the mistake of leaning and prostrating on the table when redeeming books and writing, and after a long time, it becomes a habit, and the shape of the spinal bones either becomes hunchbacked or curved. This not only impairs health, but also becomes an improper disease in terms of body posture. For this point, as long as young students pay attention to sitting upright when reading and writing, they can maintain the normal and healthy state of the spinal bones. Secondly, let's talk about the hygiene of the thorax. What is called the "thorax"? It is the part of the spinal bones in front of the human body's gatehead and behind the backhead, both of which are surrounded by a bow-shaped rib; a name for a range formed by these three. For the hygiene of this part of the skeleton, the clothes to be worn should be looser, and should not be worn too tightly, pressing on the thorax, otherwise, it will hinder the development of the chest. Chinese girls used to have the habit of binding their chests, and European and American women also had the bad habit of binding their waists in order to compete for wasp waists, all of which violated the act of violating chest hygiene; because this kind of act of bad habit not only affects the development of the chest, causing the ribs to deform, but also hinders the breathing of the lungs and the digestion of the stomach and intestines. Therefore, this kind of bad habit that violates hygiene should not be imitated by each other, but should be eliminated as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Finally, it is also necessary to say a word about the hygiene of the foot bones. Most young students now wear leather shoes, which does not hinder hygiene; however, the shape of leather shoes changes from time to time, and the toe of the shoe is sometimes pointed and sometimes round, which is where the agreement with hygiene and disagreement with hygiene lies. Because the shape of the toes is different for each person, and the shape of the shoes that is popular at the time is always sharp when it is sharp, and round when it is round. In fact, it is best to determine the shape of the shoes according to each person's foot shape, so that they fit the feet and are comfortable. But generally speaking, shoes with overly pointed front ends are prone to compressing the toes, and gradually forming a deformed state of arching and bending, which is definitely not the way to foot hygiene. Therefore, I hope that young people who love beauty should not only seek the beauty of the appearance when wearing leather shoes, but also ignore the comfort when wearing them and the convenience when walking; only by wearing shoes that fit the feet can they protect the health and beauty of the feet.</p>
<p>The hygiene of bones stops here. Let's talk about muscles next.</p>
<p>Muscle is the abbreviation of the two characters "muscle." Muscles are mostly attached to the outside of the bones. Almost every part of the body where there are bones has muscles growing around it. If we take a house as an analogy, then the bones are like the steel pipes of the house, and the muscles are like the cement attached to the outside of the steel pipes. According to calculations, the number of bones in the whole body is said to be 200; what about the number of muscles in the whole body? It's not as easy to count clearly as bones. Because the calculation methods of each person are different, some say 300, and some report 500; let's use a "lump sum" number here to say that it is roughly between 3500, which should not be a big mistake. Each muscle has a starting head and a tail ending; but there are also differences in the starting point being one and the ending being two or three, and the ending being one and the starting point being two or three. The reason why the statistics of muscles in the whole body are not unified is mainly because the starting and ending of each muscle are not uniform. As for its physiological function? That is extraordinarily complicated? It can be said that all the actions of the whole body cannot be separated from its control: to lift things, you need to use the muscles on your arms and palms, to walk, you need to use the muscles on your legs and feet, to eat, you need to use the chewing muscles to work, and even bowel movements and urination need the help of muscles. For the rest, a cry or a smile requires the use of crying and smiling muscles, and a breath requires the use of breathing muscles. In short, all the actions of the whole body will not be without its share.</p>
<p>What color are muscles? I believe there will definitely be many people who say in unison: "Bright red"! In fact, it is not. However, what you said about bright red cannot be said to be without a basis; when we peel off the skin attached to the body, don't we clearly see something bright red? What is this thing? No one will answer wrong: "This is muscle"! But wait a minute. This thing is indeed muscle, but the bright red color of this muscle is not the color of the muscle itself, but the blood stored within the muscle. If you soak this bright red muscle in a basin of cold water, it will soon lose its dye and fade, the cold water will turn red, and the muscle will turn pale green. This is like a piece of colored cloth or paper, when put into water, it fades and gradually changes to its original appearance.</p>
<p>Common Medical Knowledge</p>
<h3>Diabetes and Polyuria (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Zhenyu</p>
<p>The Cause of Polyuria</p>
<p>Polyuria is a chronic disease characterized by symptoms of thirst and excessive urination. Although similar to diabetes, the thirst and urine volume are much greater than in diabetes, and there is no sugar present in the urine. Since its cause is unrelated to diet, although the urine volume is high, the amount of excreted substances in the urine, calculated daily, is not much different from that of a normal person. Only the water content is increased, and this increase in water is due to excessive drinking.</p>
<p>The root of this disease lies in a disorder of the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland is also an endocrine gland, divided into three parts: the anterior lobe, the intermediate lobe, and the posterior lobe. The substances secreted by the three parts have different functions. The anterior lobe is closely related to human growth and development. Excess secretion leads to tall stature, while insufficient secretion leads to short stature. The secretions of the intermediate and posterior lobes, although not directly related to growth, have the ability to contract smooth muscle. If their secretions are injected into an animal's body, blood pressure increases, urine output increases, and there is also the ability to contract the uterus, hence its use in obstetrics as a labor-inducing agent. While the metabolism of sugar in the human body is closely related to insulin, the secretions of the pituitary gland also have the ability to regulate it. Therefore, the pituitary gland is a gland with multiple functions. Polyuria caused by a disease of the pituitary gland itself is called congenital polyuria. The reason for this is not yet fully understood, but it is only known to be related to the internal secretions of the pituitary gland. Alternatively, it may be caused by tumors in the brain, syphilitic invasion affecting the nerves related to the pituitary gland, or traumatic injuries to the brain or spinal cord. Other factors, such as infectious diseases like meningitis and typhoid fever, where the toxin attacks the nervous system of the pituitary gland, can also lead to polyuria. Disease caused by these types of factors is called acquired polyuria.</p>
<p>The Pathology of Polyuria</p>
<p>In patients with polyuria, the pituitary gland or the nerves related to the gland are either injured or diseased, as demonstrated by anatomical experience. Experiments on lower animals have shown that damage to the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland results in polyuria. Injury or disease of the nerves related to the pituitary gland also leads to the development of polyuria. Experiments on lower animals involving the injection of pituitary gland extract while simultaneously severing the renal nerves of the animal have also revealed polyuria. If the blood from this animal is transfused into the body of another healthy animal, transmissible polyuria results, the mechanism of which is currently difficult to understand. Recently, Mohr and Scheer experimented on dogs, tightly ligating the stalk of the pituitary gland with silver wire, resulting in polyuria. If the thyroid gland (another endocrine gland) was removed, the polyuria ceased, but if thyroid gland substance was ingested, the polyuria recurred. Thus, artificial polyuria can be created at will. In conclusion, while the pituitary gland is the primary factor in polyuria, the thyroid gland is also an important component.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>The names of all the muscles are extraordinarily numerous, each with a different name based on its location or function. As for the structure of muscles, it is nothing more than two types: voluntary and involuntary muscles. What is the difference between voluntary and involuntary muscles? The difference can be understood simply by considering the literal meaning of the terms: voluntary muscles are those whose movement is subject to conscious control, while involuntary muscles are the opposite. This seems self-explanatory, and I believe everyone will understand it.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about muscle hygiene. Because muscles and exercise are fundamentally and inextricably linked, muscle hygiene is almost exclusively concerned with exercise.</p>
<p>Why are muscle hygiene and exercise so closely linked that they cannot be separated for even a moment? Now, let's explain this relationship between exercise and muscle hygiene.</p>
<p>Generally, a person's health is judged by the development or lack thereof of their muscles. While this is not absolutely reasonable, it is not without considerable justification and basis, or it can be said to be relatively reasonable. We only need to observe that healthy people generally have relatively abundant and developed muscles. Conversely, people with weak muscles, the so-called "skin and bones" type, are generally not very healthy. However, whether muscles are abundant or not, firm or not, often depends on whether the person pays attention to exercise. People who pay attention to exercise tend to have developed and firm muscles; otherwise, their muscles are often lean, and their flesh is soft. Therefore, if a person wants to be strong and healthy, with abundant and developed muscles, then exercise is indispensable. This principle is very simple and easy to understand. However, now we need to go further and explain why exercise can develop muscles and make them firm. In other words, what is the principle by which exercise can develop and firm muscles?</p>
<p>Now I will explain this principle.</p>
<p>Readers all know, what phenomenon does our body experience during exercise? During exercise, the blood circulation in our body definitely becomes vigorous, the heart rate increases extraordinarily, and at the same time, body temperature also rises, breathing becomes rapid, and we sweat all over, eventually leading to muscle fatigue and physical exhaustion. What does this indicate? This indicates that changes have occurred in the substances within our body due to the labor of our muscles. What substances within the body undergo these changes? Physiologists have proven through experiments that the substance is the decomposition of "carbohydrates" in our body. Carbohydrates have a scientific name called "hydrated carbon," so it can also be said that the material change in the body during exercise is the decomposition of this "hydrated carbon." Since exercise requires the consumption of a lot of hydrated carbon in the body, it goes without saying that a large amount of hydrated carbon is needed for replenishment after exercise. The reason is clear. Laborers eat more, and people who have exercised generally increase their food intake in order to replenish the hydrated carbon consumed and lost in the body. This is just like when the fuel in a stove burns out, it is necessary to add coal and other fuels before it can be reignited and provide warmth. The accelerated breathing during exercise is also easy to understand. The material change in the body during exercise, as mentioned above, is the decomposition of hydrated carbon in the body, and the reason why hydrated carbon can be decomposed is entirely due to the oxygen in the air. In other words, the hydrated carbon in the body relies on the action of this oxygen to initiate the decomposition, produce heat, and generate the power for exercise. Accelerated breathing, on the one hand, removes waste products (carbon) from the body after they have been used, and on the other hand, supplies a large amount of oxygen from the outside to be used for decomposing the hydrated carbon in the body.</p>
<p>Because of this reason, the body heat and power consumed during exercise rely on the decomposition of hydrated carbon in the body, that is, during exercise, a large amount of hydrated carbon in the body must be consumed, and after exercise, it goes without saying that a large amount of hydrated carbon is needed for replenishment, and the food taken in for replenishment is often more than what was lost. When there is more replenishment than loss, the contraction ability of the muscles naturally increases, the muscle tissue itself also gradually increases and becomes firmer, and the muscle's power of movement also becomes richer and stronger.</p>
<p>This is the principle behind how exercise can develop and strengthen muscles, and it is also a simple explanation of why exercise is the only way to maintain muscle hygiene.</p>
<p>Because exercise can develop and strengthen muscles, it can also be said that exercise is the only way to maintain muscle hygiene. This has already been explained very clearly above. However, what has been said above only explains why "exercise" can develop and strengthen muscles, so the reason for the method of muscle hygiene. As for what kind of exercise can achieve muscle hygiene and achieve the goal of muscle enhancement, this has not yet been mentioned.</p>
<p>Exercise is indeed the only way to maintain muscle hygiene, but to achieve this goal of muscle hygiene, there must also be a limit on the type of exercise. Otherwise, if the person engaging in exercise exceeds the limit of "hygiene," they may not be able to achieve the goal of muscle hygiene. Sometimes, it may even create a harmful effect that is the opposite of muscle hygiene. The so-called limit is the appropriate degree of just the right amount. It should not be too tiring or too intense. When exercise reaches a considerable degree of fatigue, one must not ignore the overexertion of the muscles and continue exercising. Because when the muscles feel considerably fatigued during exercise, one should immediately stop exercising and give them a chance to rest so that they can recover. Otherwise, if one continues to exercise for a long time when feeling considerable fatigue, it will inevitably lead to a sudden decrease in ability and eventually reach a point where one is unable to exercise and has no strength to exercise. This is overexertion. When the muscles are overexerted, on the one hand, the waste products remaining after consumption in the body increase and accumulate, and there is not enough time to excrete them. On the other hand, too many substances are consumed in the body, and there is not enough time to replenish them. Therefore, the muscles are in a state of inaction where it is difficult to trigger a contraction even after stimulation. At this time, the only solution is to immediately stop exercising, provide rest, and provide fresh air, which can restore their fatigue. Therefore, massaging the legs and feet or washing the feet with warm water after running exercise or long-distance travel to promote blood flow in the lower legs is also a good way to restore fatigue.</p>
<p>Not only should the duration of exercise be limited, and not be too tiring or too intense, but also one should not be distracted and have various other thoughts during exercise. In other words, one should concentrate on exercising and not be distracted. It is also not advisable to use the brain for work immediately after exercise for a considerable amount of time. Instead, one should give oneself a complete rest with all thoughts emptied. Because during exercise, it goes without saying that a large amount of blood will flow into the muscles. If one uses the brain at the same time, then wouldn't part of the blood have to flow into the brain? However, the amount of blood in a person's body is limited. If the brain needs blood to think, the amount of blood in the muscles will decrease invisibly. This will result in damage to both sides, and neither will achieve good results. The reason why one should rest for a considerable amount of time after exercise and not use the brain is also because at this time, blood flow has not yet returned to a peaceful, normal state, and a large amount of blood is still retained in the muscles. If one immediately does other things and uses the brain at this time, such as reading and thinking, the brain will not get a large amount of blood, and thought will definitely not be unified. Reading will also be like not seeing, and one will not be able to read into one's brain.</p>
<p>Finally, let's talk about a few things to pay attention to regarding exercise as the conclusion of this section.</p>
<p>(1) Exercise should be done in a clean place, and outdoors is better than indoors, because it is easier to breathe fresh air.</p>
<p>(2) When exercising, it is advisable to wear short clothes and pants that are comfortable and easy to move in. Tight and narrow clothes that constrict the neck and chest can hinder blood flow and smooth breathing, and are not suitable at all.</p>
<p>(3) To engage in exercise, one must have perseverance, do it regularly every day without interruption. At the same time, it is especially important to progress gradually, from easy to difficult, from light to heavy. One must not suddenly be light and then heavy, suddenly start and then stop, without a standard.</p>
<p>(4) It is not advisable to exercise before or after eating. One should also temporarily stop when feeling physically or mentally unwell.</p>
<p>(5) Exercise should not be allowed to become too tiring and should be based on each person's original physical strength. One must not force oneself. After exercise, one must also have a considerable amount of rest time and should not immediately do other work - whether physical or mental work, both are not advisable.</p>
<p>(6) After exercising, drink more boiled water to replenish the water lost during exercise, which is both hygienic and refreshing.</p>
<p>(7) Exercise methods vary depending on each person's occupation and environment. People who are sedentary and lack physical labor in their daily lives must choose a simple form of physical exercise.</p>
<p>(8) After exercising, special attention must be paid to avoiding getting cold and catching a cold; this is most easily overlooked by those who engage in exercise. However, getting sick from exercise is not worth the loss and is not worth it at all.</p>
<p>Of course, there are many other things to pay attention to, which cannot be described in detail here. The above is just a casual listing of a few points that should be paid attention to as a health warning for exercisers.</p>
<p>Colloquial Medical Talks</p>
<h3>A Brief Discussion on Blood Transfusion</h3>
<p>— Qu Shaoheng</p>
<p>In underworld slang, money is called "blood." Having money is called "having blood," and having a lot of money is called "having a lot of blood." Therefore, borrowing money is called "borrowing blood," because money is very useful, and without money, nothing can be done. As the saying goes, "A living person is a dead man without money in his hands," which is true. In medicine, someone with insufficient blood is called anemic, and in society, someone without money is called poor. Poverty means deficiency. When a person has little money, they are poor, and if they are so poor that they cannot maintain their livelihood, they should borrow money to alleviate their urgent need. When a person has little blood, they become ill, and if they are seriously ill and on the verge of death, they should also borrow blood to save their life. However, most people in the world are clear about the principles of borrowing money but are ignorant of the meaning of borrowing blood. Therefore, they may be generous and willing to lend money, but when it comes to borrowing blood, they are often hesitant and reluctant. They do not realize that a healthy person donating a little blood is like a drop in the bucket and does not cause them any pain or distress. Why be stingy and unwilling to do it? Now, please allow me to briefly describe the medical significance, effectiveness, and methods of borrowing blood.</p>
<p>Borrowing blood is blood transfusion. The application of blood transfusion in medicine has a long history. However, due to a lack of knowledge of serology at the time, it only increased unnecessary sacrifices. It was not until the rapid progress of modern serological chemistry that the phenomenon of homologous blood cell agglutination was discovered (Schattock, Donath, Landsteiner, Grukbaum, etc.), and the great achievements of Jausky, Moss, Dungern, Hirschfeld, and others in discovering the four blood types in humans eliminated almost all the dangers of blood transfusion. Furthermore, Hustin, Weil, Ruck, Freud, and Lewisohn pioneered the indirect blood transfusion method of adding sodium citrate to the blood, making blood transfusion operations even easier. Now, let me discuss the details further.</p>
<p>The functions of blood transfusion are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) To replenish depleted blood vessels, thereby continuing to strengthen cardiac function and prevent shock.</p>
<p>(2) To enhance tissue respiration through the oxygen-transporting function of red blood cells.</p>
<p>(3) Not only can it provide various nutrients contained in plasma, but it can also introduce various endocrine fluids.</p>
<p>(4) It can also introduce immune substances to increase resistance to infectious diseases.</p>
<p>(5) To introduce blood coagulation-promoting substances contained in serum, thereby causing hemostasis.</p>
<p>(6) Blood proteins can stimulate the bone marrow and other hematopoietic organs to enhance function and promote the production of new blood.</p>
<p>There are two main methods of blood transfusion: direct and indirect.</p>
<p>(1) Direct Blood Transfusion: This is a method of directly transfusing fresh blood into the patient's blood without any manipulation. In theory, it is ideal, but there are many inconveniences in practice.</p>
<p>(2) Indirect Blood Transfusion: This is a method of adding sodium citrate to the blood to make it non-clotting before transfusing it. This method is simple to operate and can be implemented by anyone. Therefore, I will describe a simple implementation method:</p>
<p>Selection of Blood Donors: Blood donors must not have leprosy, tuberculosis, syphilis, malaria, or various infectious diseases. It is best if they are of the same gender and similar age.</p>
<p>Determination of Blood Type: Not only humans, but all vertebrate sera have the property of dissolving foreign red blood cells (hemolysins) and causing them to agglutinate (hemagglutinins), and often have the effect of dissolving (homologous hemolysins) and agglutinating (homologous hemagglutinins) red blood cells of the same species. During blood transfusion, if the red blood cells of the donor undergo lysis or agglutination in the recipient's body, it will cause serious transfusion reactions (Transfusionserscheinnng) and even death. Therefore, it is essential to observe whether the donor's blood cells can be mutually compatible with the recipient's serum. There are two methods for determining blood type: using standard sera and not using standard sera.</p>
<p>A. Method Using Standard Sera</p>
<p>Human blood types are broadly divided into four groups, but the methods of classification vary among scholars.</p>
<p>Jansly I II III IV</p>
<p>Moss IV II III I</p>
<p>Dungern</p>
<p>und O A B AB</p>
<p>Hirschfeld</p>
<p>Collective Origin O A B AB</p>
<p>Collection AB B A O</p>
<p>J and M's methods are prone to errors, so the D and H methods are generally preferred. D and H's methods use uppercase Latin letters to represent red blood cell agglutinogens and lowercase letters to represent serum agglutinins. There are no identical agglutinogens and agglutinins in the blood of the same race, so no agglutination reaction occurs. However, if blood from different races is mixed, an agglutination phenomenon will immediately occur.</p>
<p>Now, assuming that A and B sera are used as standard sera and the unknown blood cells are mixed with them, the blood type of the unknown blood can be determined. The method is to first take a drop each of A and B sera at both ends of a glass slide and add an unknown fresh blood sample to each. Then, shake the glass slide back and forth several times, and the presence or absence of an agglutination reaction can be checked within five minutes.</p>
<p>If agglutination is found in B serum, then the blood of the subject being tested is type A. If agglutination is found in A serum, then the blood of the subject being tested is type B. If agglutination is found in both A and B sera, then the blood of the subject being tested is type AB. If no agglutination is found in either A or B serum, then the blood of the subject being tested is type O. Therefore, type O is generally preferred for blood donors, and type AB is generally preferred for blood recipients. In other words, type O blood can be given to everyone, and type AB blood can be received from everyone. The relationship is as follows:</p>
<p>B. Method Without Using Standard Sera</p>
<p>(1) Nurnberger's Three-Drop Method: Place a drop of 10% sodium citrate on a glass slide, then add a drop each of the donor's and recipient's blood, mix them, and observe for an agglutination reaction. A negative reaction indicates the same type, and a positive reaction indicates different types.</p>
<p>(2) Mandelstamm's Four-Drop Method: Place a drop of distilled water on a glass slide, add a drop of the recipient's blood to cause hemolysis, then add a drop each of 5% sodium citrate and the donor's blood, mix them, and observe for an agglutination reaction.</p>
<p>The amount of blood taken from the blood donor: The impact of the amount of blood lost on the overall condition varies depending on the race and physique. The amount of blood taken from Chinese people should be limited to around 500 ml. Therefore, when a large amount of blood transfusion is needed, at least two blood donors should be prepared.</p>
<p>Recently, there are organizations that supply blood transfusion by collecting several volunteer blood donors, and in addition to pre-screening for blood-borne infectious diseases, they also predetermine the type of blood, so that when there is a need for blood transfusion, they can summon suitable donors at any time. This is similar to the meaning of pledging items and whether they are compatible, which is truly an action that should not be delayed or postponed.</p>
<h3>Public Announcement to Physicians, Midwives, and Nurses</h3>
<p>— Shanghai Medical Association</p>
<p>The Association is currently planning to compile and publish a "Directory of Physicians in Shanghai." We are issuing survey forms to physicians, midwives, and nurses to fill out. However, we fear that the investigation may be incomplete and omissions are inevitable. Any physicians, midwives, or nurses practicing in this city who wish to have their names included in this directory, please notify the Association at No. 25 Chi Bang Road after seeing this announcement, so that we can send you the survey form. This is a special announcement.</p>
<h3>Vitamin C Therapy for Pneumonia</h3>
<p>— Sun Huiying</p>
<p>Although the use of vitamins for various diseases other than specific deficiency diseases has been widely practiced, it is now gradually reaching the stage of criticism. The author has used vitamins A, B, C, D, etc., for various diseases, and considers the most effective to be 10, B for traumatic nerve obstruction, and pneumonia. After a confirmed diagnosis of pneumonia, inject 0.020 grams (mg) of Vitamin C at the same time. Then, inject 200 to 500 mg daily. It is better to administer it in multiple injections than to administer a large dose in one injection. This Vitamin C injection can promote defervescence and diaphoretic antipyretics. Usually, when treatment begins, the fever subsides immediately, and the patient's subjective symptoms are significantly alleviated. All patients with anxiety, loss of appetite, and cyanosis, although their physical symptoms have not yet changed, their food and conversation are quite vibrant. This therapy can also shorten the course of bronchopneumonia, and is effective in preventing postoperative pneumonia. In addition, it is also effective for hemoptysis, cholecystitis, pyelonephritis, morning sickness, etc. (Excerpt from Yu's Research Laboratory Reading Group)</p>

<h3>Germany's Future Direction</h3>
<p>— Mao Lie</p>
<p>If Germany does not know when enough is enough and calls it quits, and if the great powers do not inflict a serious blow on it to make it retreat in the face of difficulty, then Germany's desires will only grow day by day, and its acts of aggression will only increase without end, until a second world war breaks out, which will then stop.</p>
<p>Now that Austria has been annexed and Czechoslovakia has been partitioned, what is Germany's next move? Most obviously, it has already made economic demands on Romania, and its eyes are already fixed on Romania. Romania certainly has a sense of overwhelming fear. Everyone will naturally think that it is about to strike against Romania.</p>
<p>According to the British "Greenwich Times," Germany will demand its pre-war colonies and sovereignty over Alsace and Lorraine from France in the near future.</p>
<p>In addition, there are certainly other possible speculations.</p>
<p>I am not a prophet, nor am I a political scientist familiar with international affairs. But I also have some opinions on Germany's future direction.</p>
<p>In my view, Germany's current goal is to restore the position it had at the beginning of the European War more than twenty years ago. Its initial method is to annex the small countries near it. Austria and it share the same race and culture, and were allies before the European War, so it wants to annex it. Bohemia and Moravia in Czechoslovakia originally belonged to Austria, so it wants to annex them. Then, Hungary, which originally formed a united kingdom with Austria, it will naturally want to annex even more. Its most recent destination seems to be Hungary.</p>
<p>It is true that Hungary already listened to Germany's demands last year and was restricted to being an agricultural country, and its army has become insignificant. However, it is still an independent country. If Germany wants to do something in the East, even if it is the nearby Romania, it must first completely annex and digest Hungary completely. Otherwise, with Hungary sandwiched between it and Romania, how can it be at ease? Some people say that Germany allowed Hungary to invade Carpathian Ruthenia of Czechoslovakia, not out of love for Hungary, but merely using Hungary as a tool to take it later as if from an outer treasury. This can also be used as collateral evidence for what I said.</p>
<p>It is certainly a natural trend under the current circumstances that Germany has demands on Britain and France. But it does not seem to have reached that point yet. It must solve the small countries nearby one by one before launching against Britain and France. As for advancing eastward against Russia, even if this were to happen - I don't believe it - it would definitely be after it has solved all kinds of problems with Britain and France.</p>
<p>"Befriend distant states and attack those nearby" is a principle that Germany understands very well. However, its "befriending" is not about jade and silk, but about intimidation and deception. It will continue to proceed according to this principle in the future.</p>
<h3>Escape</h3>
<p>— Ding Di</p>
<p>Escape?</p>
<p>Bang bang… bang bang…</p>
<p>Gunshots? Doesn't sound like it… Gunshots don't have that sound. A box cannon… no! …Artillery then? This is inside the city. Street fighting, huh, there's no artillery! No! …Lower down… lower… lower, lower. Head, a burst of dizziness… ah! It’s just my ears ringing, not gunshots. Haha! Good fortune! No need to be timid!</p>
<p>Opening the drawer, Director Wang took out a cigar. Strike! A streak of fire. Pff! The spittoon rang once, then fell silent again.</p>
<p>The Pacification Squad leader is quite something; even though he, himself, lost a concubine, now that the Director is in his pocket, with the Director around, does he need to worry about not enjoying beautiful women? …Too haggard! The only flaw, a scar, under his left eye, badly disfiguring him! -- Might as well send him a short Japanese girl... Good fortune, the old saying is right. The ×× people are coming, if I don’t run, I’ll actually get an official position, isn’t that good fortune?</p>
<p>Don't think about those frustrating things! Director Wang, puffing out wisps of smoke, narrowed his eyes; the mahjong tiles from the Central × Club, jumped into his eyelids, exquisite, smooth, beautiful. I should get myself a set!</p>
<p>…Slaughter tax regulations, must be drafted tomorrow… Tomorrow! Can't delay any longer… But tomorrow… the news is bad… Tomorrow! Damn it! Guerrillas! Bandits! Seeing a fortune right in front of my eyes… Tomorrow, what to do? Draft them or not? …</p>
<p>Outside the window, ah! Shadows are moving… Could they have entered the city? Guer– Guer– Guerrillas…</p>
<p>Murmurs... rustling… rustling… A mouse's slender tail, twitches and then curves. Gone into its hole… Gnawing on what? …</p>
<p>Is it a mouse? No? Voices––People on the street?</p>
<p>In the smoky shadows: Several hundred strong men. Boom… boom… boom——Oh! The county government office has been blown open… Run– Run…</p>
<p>The shadow of the window is moving… Steady yourself! Pull the curtains tight, a red flower on the curtain… Red is the most detestable… This is blood, blood, blood. Don't look! -- He calls Wang Sheng to make tea:</p>
<p>"Wang Sheng! Wang Sheng! You idiot! Did you go to sleep? Hmph! It's only twelve o'clock!"</p>
<p>"Wang Sheng! Wang Sheng!"</p>
<p>A wave of darkness before his eyes.</p>
<p>Head spinning! Bad luck! Sigh! Compose yourself! Staring wide-eyed, holding his head in both hands, he looks--</p>
<p>Ah! Ah! The light is out! Out? What's going on? Who's joking around? Hmph! It must be Little Hu, fiddling with the switch. "Hey! Little Hu! Little Hu!"</p>
<p>No response. He goes into the main room; the whole family is asleep. Quiet.</p>
<p>"Hey! The light's out! Don't you know?… The light… the light… Damn it!… What is this!"</p>
<p>The family all wake up, terrified, huddled together, crying, shouting, hugging, struggling.</p>
<p>Teeth chattering, body shaking, Old Master Wang trembles like a sieve.</p>
<p>Someone comes to find out from the street, Wang Sheng says:</p>
<p>"The electric wires have been cut, the whole city is dark. They're in a panic!"</p>
<p>Ping ping ping… Gunshots? Ears throbbing?… Director Wang shivers, shivers, his teeth chattering.</p>
<p>A red candle is lit. The red of blood, the red of the candle, how terrifying! A faint glimmer, trembling and flickering, high—low. Heart—falling, pressing down, floating.</p>
<p>Aren't those gunshots?</p>
<p>Run—</p>
<h3>He</h3>
<p>— Ying Jin</p>
<p>He could certainly be considered a patriotic youth.</p>
<p>Every morning he absolutely had to sing "On the Songhua River" twice, but he would also follow it with one rendition of "When Will You Return." Three months ago he started shouting, "I'm going to the interior!" but he ultimately never left.</p>
<p>The fact that he "never left" naturally had its reasons: for example, his mother wouldn't allow it, he didn't have enough travel money, and he didn't have any companions, etc.</p>
<p>But in the past few days he's started shouting again, as if from the ashes:</p>
<p>"Really, I absolutely must go to the interior! Staying here will grind away my will!"</p>
<p>Then he says to every friend: "If I go to the interior, could you help me out with some travel money?"</p>
<p>"Of course! But has your mother already given you permission? And do you have a companion?"</p>
<p>"That doesn't matter!"</p>
<p>But, one day, two days… quickly passed, and he still lived there.</p>
<p>If someone were to ask him:</p>
<p>"Why haven't you gone to the interior yet?"</p>
<p>Then, his reply would be—</p>
<p>"I'm not going; because there's work to do in Shanghai: for example, in the next hour I have to attend a reading group, and in the hour after that I have to attend a literary symposium."</p>
<p>Having said that, he lowered his head, and used that "Parker" vacuum-filler pen to start writing:</p>
<p>"Books to buy this month: Popular Philosophy, Methodology, Outline of New Philosophy, Complete Course in Dialectics, Lectures on Political Economy, On Political Parties, Primer of Leninism…"</p>
<p>This month quickly passed again, and it didn't seem like he bought so many books, so a busybody asked him with a dubious attitude:</p>
<p>"Have you bought all the books you were supposed to buy this month?"</p>
<p>"No. —Alas! Books are simply too expensive to buy!"</p>
<p>But every morning, the items placed on the glass plate under his pillow were still: four slices of buttered toast and a cup of steaming hot coffee with milk. And the item most recently pressed under the glass plate was precisely that list of "Books to Buy This Month."</p>
<h3>The Lazy Gardener</h3>
<p>— Written by Jian Qing</p>
<h3>Must Leave</h3>
<p>— Geng Zhi</p>
<p>There are certain places one "must visit," and after arriving, one "must speak." However, one must never stay long; one must leave! At the very least, one must leave before the gathering breaks up; or at least after someone else has already left. Otherwise, I'd just be like anyone else. How would I demonstrate my value!</p>
<p>You can say that there's a meeting elsewhere, that I have to go to, so I have to take my leave. In any case, no one will investigate whether there's actually a meeting elsewhere; even if there's a meeting elsewhere but it hasn't started yet, you can always wander around in a small alleyway, or linger at any interesting place. You can always say that there's a banquet elsewhere, that I can't miss, so I'm sorry to leave this gathering. Anyway, no one is following behind you, and if you haven't eaten enough, if you're hungry, just go home and eat some leftovers, or even better, just have another proper meal at home, why not.</p>
<p>The wonderful uses of this, of course, I don't need to say more; everyone knows. I myself have repeatedly expressed my sincere envy to these "busy people" or "important people" who must leave at gatherings or banquets, thinking that they really are the chosen ones of heaven, the pillars of society, so everyone needs them, and they are temporarily running late, so they must leave.</p>
<p>Similarly, a traditional doctor—now called "physician"—can also sit in a sedan chair—now taking a chartered car or automobile—and drive around the streets all day long, showing that his business is booming and that he has many house calls. As soon as he arrives at a patient's house, he puts three fingers on their pulse, or takes out a stethoscope, and immediately leaves. That is to say: before going to a patient's house, he must leave, must go to many places; after going to a patient's house, he must leave, must leave early, and in this way, this traditional doctor or physician can become a "famous doctor" or a "national expert."</p>
<p>Similarly, a teacher can teach several courses, and when one course is still a few minutes from being finished, he can roll up his textbooks and leave. A talented person does more work, the students will surely think that.</p>
<p>Similarly, a courtesan going out to a banquet to offer drinks, as soon as the erhu sounds and she sings a couple of lines, someone outside calls for her to move to another gathering, and so she "rests for a while." Tsk tsk tsk, indeed a courtesan, the people at the banquet will surely say that.</p>
<p>Similarly, similarly, … the other possibilities are endless.</p>
<p>However, the "must leave" mentioned above all emphasize time, although it is effective, but the path that one "must take" also cannot be ignored, otherwise one might fail to consider everything, and the result would be imperfect.</p>
<p>First, one must take "shortcuts" like the Zhongnan Mountains. In the past, people who wanted to become officials only had to live in the Zhongnan Mountains, declaring their lofty purity, and the emperor would summon them to the capital and reward them with high office and great wealth. Now, the Zhongnan Mountains may be too far away, not fashionable, so one might as well understand it spiritually and use it flexibly. The simplest thing is, as long as you have money, naturally go to the "Zhongnan Mountains" abroad to live for a while, and a "sacred edict" will come down. In addition, whether you charge forward or carefully hone your skills, as long as you accumulate certain qualifications in a certain field, you can still become an official, so any field can become a "shortcut."</p>
<p>Second, one must take the "main road" on the surface. It is said that a certain moralistic scholar of the Qianlong and Jiaqing eras became famous for "not taking shortcuts," although one day he encountered rain in the countryside and jumped over a ditch, and was seen by a shepherd boy, to whom he gave some money, telling him not to tell anyone, but he was still not harmed in his being a gentleman who "must take the main road." So, those who want to become famous today can make a show of acting according to the rules or broadly giving and helping the masses, anyway no shepherd boy will see you, and if he sees you, and you give him some money, he will surely be endlessly grateful and proclaim your great virtue to everyone.</p>
<p>Third, it seems that one can also take the miraculously effective "inside line." The inside line is an extremely thin and subtle thing, how can one take it? However, many people take it, and its effectiveness is also the greatest. Because it is said that lines can connect things, so by relying on them, you can also achieve your goals. However, since there are many people on the line, and it is easily broken, those who take it must be especially careful.</p>
<p>In addition, certain paths must have certain ways of taking them, and it is also necessary to mention them briefly in order to see the full picture of "must leave."</p>
<p>When you see refugees, close your eyes and walk away; when you hear about national affairs, cover your ears and walk away; when you see a young woman, "follow her with your eyes and offer blood" as you walk away; "fox trot" in a certain place, "hot pot" walk; when you hear that the capital is seeking highly talented people who "do not seek fame," run on the road; if you become an official, walk with escorts under the pines, sit in a sedan chair among the flowers; when you hear that there is a great fortune to be made somewhere, walk like ants attached to something; … Most importantly, when you encounter danger, when there is a difficult task, then quickly use the best of the thirty-six strategies, which is to leave! Of course, these ways of "leaving" are all "necessary," if you want to take the various paths mentioned above.</p>
<p>But these are the ones that others must take, but for me, there is no road to "take," no method to "take," and I "leave" because I have no choice, then "must" it be the jianghu!</p>

<h3>In the Flames of War</h3>
<p>— Zhou Yan</p>
<p>Twelve: Town Chief Chen's Hidden Pain</p>
<p>Battalion Commander Ye's troops had by this time retreated to Fenglin Town, twenty li northwest of Hapu Town. Fang Hui, along with the medical team and the people, took the wounded soldiers and spoils of war, searching all the way until the morning of the next day before finally rejoining the group. When she told her brother about the clever way she ambushed the enemy in the middle of the night, Battalion Commander Ye's staff, who were listening nearby, all praised her endlessly. Staff Officer Zhu was particularly happy, repeatedly exclaiming:</p>
<p>"I must record this glorious deed. Although we are temporarily isolated from above, the central government will definitely send a senior official to the guerrilla area to organize and contact us. At that time, I can report this matter and ask him to issue a commendation."</p>
<p>"Why bother? She's just a child. If she accidentally killed a few enemies, it's nothing to be proud of," Battalion Commander Ye said modestly.</p>
<p>"No, no," Staff Officer Zhu said seriously, "Miss Ye's actions, showing both intelligence and courage in wiping out enemy troops, is precisely the most outstanding material in our history of resistance. Our resistance is a war of attrition. If we can take one of them for one of ours, we've already made a profit. Now, she's killed three of them, and we haven't lost anyone. Isn't that worth a commendation?"</p>
<p>Battalion Commander Ye stopped saying anything. He was busy deploying defenses in Fenglin Town to prevent the × army from pursuing and attacking, and at the same time sent people to Hapu Town to gather information. The messengers returned and reported that the × army had captured Hapu Town, known as "Little Shanghai," and seemed to be satisfied, now busy with burning, killing, raping, and looting. For the moment, there was no intention to continue the attack. However, one thing that surprised everyone was that Chen Zhaoqian, the town chief of Hapu Town, had actually surrendered to the × army and came forward to serve as the chairman of the puppet "Maintenance Committee."</p>
<p>"Really, you can know a person's face but not their heart! I never thought that Town Chief Chen, such an honest and trustworthy person, would actually risk such a great disgrace and take on the false position of the 'Maintenance Committee.' I will never again trust the gentlemen of the world so easily," Battalion Commander Ye said angrily.</p>
<p>Cai Hefeng, the owner of Hefeng Lumber Company, also fled with the troops. He and Chen Zhaoqian were close friends for many years, and when he heard that he had become the chairman of the "Maintenance Committee," he was also somewhat skeptical. He originally wanted to return to Hapu Town to see if his lumber company was still intact, so he came to see Battalion Commander Ye and said: (38)</p>

<h3>Commemorating the "Shanghai Liberation"</h3>
<p>— Liu Feng</p>
<p>Today, as Shanghai becomes an "isolated island," and as the War of Resistance enters a new stage, we, the four million compatriots of Shanghai, commemorate the "Shanghai Liberation." How profound and thought-provoking is this significance!</p>
<p>Thirteen years ago today, the National Revolutionary Army had advanced to Longhua. The workers and masses of Shanghai, as well as all patriotic citizens, in order to take action in response to the Northern Expedition and to end the rule of the anti-revolutionary warlords in Shanghai, at twelve noon on this day, the Shanghai General Labor Union issued the order for the second general strike. The vast majority of workers in Shanghai participated in this strike. Next, an armed uprising began, immediately seizing the weapons of the military police and occupying various districts, and attacking the Zhili-Fengtian Allied Army stationed at the railway station. After two days and one night (from noon on the 21st to 6 p.m. on the 22nd) of fierce street fighting, the anti-revolutionary warlords were ultimately defeated and driven out of Shanghai by the heroic struggle of the workers and masses of Shanghai and all patriotic citizens!</p>
<p>We cannot ignore that the National Revolution at that time was anti-imperialist and anti-feudal, so the armed uprising of the workers and masses of Shanghai was merely a heroic expression of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism. Of course, this anti-imperialist and anti-feudal task was not completed at that time, and in today's War of Resistance, we must complete it under the task of resisting × and resisting traitors.</p>
<p>What lessons did the "Shanghai Liberation" of March 21st teach us? In a word, it is: The power of the people cannot be underestimated! In other words: Truth cannot be overcome by any brute force, conversely, any brute force can only collapse and perish under the great power of truth. This is the most fair and also the most ruthless iron rule laid down by history!</p>
<p>Before the armed uprising of March 21st, there were two other uprisings in Shanghai. After the failure of the second uprising, the demon Sun Chuanfang used cruel methods to massacre the workers and masses of Shanghai and all patriotic citizens, using broadswords to kill revolutionary leaders and patriotic citizens who distributed or read leaflets. A Shanghai person in their twenties can still imagine what it was like at that time in Nanshi and Zhabei: heads hanging from electric poles, corpses lying beside the roads, and brutal "so-called broadsword teams" patrolling the streets incessantly. …</p>
<p>However, did the demon's means of intimidation deter all the patriotic citizens of Shanghai? No! Not only did it not, but the demon instead ended his tyrannical fate under the heroic struggle of all the patriotic citizens of Shanghai!</p>
<p>Today, Shanghai has become an "isolated island." The lives of the four million citizens of Shanghai are even worse than they were thirteen years ago. However, Shanghai had the glorious "3·21," and this glorious "3·21" was created by the patriotic citizens of Shanghai! Therefore, today, as we commemorate the "Shanghai Liberation" of "3·21," we should invigorate our spirit of "3·21" a hundredfold or a thousandfold. Under the belief that "resistance will surely be victorious, nation-building will surely succeed," we must continue to struggle. Then, will the second "3·21," the second "Shanghai Liberation," not arrive soon?</p>
<p>Fellow citizens of Shanghai! We commemorate "3·21." From now on, let us invigorate our spirit of "3·21" a hundredfold or a thousandfold. Truth is on our side, and light is about to come!</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Talks on the European Situation</h3>
<p>— Fo</p>
<p>There May Be Even Worse Than This</p>
<p>Hitler violated the Munich Agreement, invaded and occupied Czechoslovakia. The countries of Britain and France realized that they had been tricked by Mr. Hitler, and that his last words about territorial demands were completely lies. So everyone condemned Hitler, saying that he disregarded good faith and broke his promises. But Mr. Hitler's attitude was very calm and indifferent, thinking that "Let them laugh and scold, I'll do as I please." My friend, Mr. Someone, once traveled to Wulin. The spring sunshine was bright, and he was boating on West Lake. He saw a monk teasing a young woman on the shore of West Lake. Mr. Someone pointed at him and laughed, saying: "You thieving monk, you also want to flirt with women?" The monk heard this and replied: "Not only flirt, there may be even worse than this." Now, Hitler's reply to Britain, France, and other countries is probably the same, not only Czechoslovakia, there may be even worse than this.</p>
<p>Chamberlain Built Millions of Pagodas</p>
<p>Because Hitler broke his promise, Mr. Chamberlain gave a speech in Birmingham the other night, in which he exaggerated the merits of the appeasement policy. He said, "The first purpose of my visit to Germany was finally achieved. European peace was preserved because of this trip. If not for this trip, millions of families in Europe today would be crying." Indeed, if Mr. Chamberlain had not gone to Germany, the war would have already begun, and it is impossible to know if millions or tens of millions of lives would have been destroyed. Our custom says, "Saving a life is better than building a seven-story pagoda." Mr. Chamberlain has truly accumulated immeasurable merit, I wonder how many millions or tens of millions of pagodas he has built; but the higher Mr. Chamberlain's merit, the more pagodas there will be in the world, and the world can truly be peaceful from now on, and Mr. Chamberlain's great accomplishment will thus be completed.</p>
<h3>Hard On Dad</h3>
<p>— Yan Hua</p>
<p>"listen,Darling"</p>
<p>A Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Production Premiering at the Cathay Theatre</p>
<p>Since Freddie Bartholomew first displayed his quiet, silent, and special style of a young English boy in "David Copperfield," this rising child star with a beautiful face has been loved by movie fans around the world.</p>
<p>Afterward, he starred in the equally moving "Captains Courageous" and "Kidnapped," confirming Bartholomew's character and personality on the screen. That is: he is good at playing children in aristocratic families who do not fully understand the ways of the world and are very kind in nature, as in "David Copperfield" and "Kidnapped."</p>
<p>If Bartholomew continues to develop with such a personality, although it has already become a fixed role for him, his future success is limitless.</p>
<p>But in "Hard On Dad," Bartholomew, who has always appeared in a silent, quiet, and noble style, has completely changed his personality. Look at him: he is so rude and reckless, so naughty and garrulous. In it, he plays the nephew of a gas station worker. He helps his little girlfriend, her mother finds a lover. The whole story is immersed in pure and fantastic fantasy. It is written through a romantic comedy about the remarriage of a mother with children. On the surface, it seems like an educational film, but in reality, it is a bizarre and fantastic love interlude.</p>
<p>Formally speaking, this film raises a woman's issue, which is, after a husband dies, the wife does not receive any inheritance. She has two children who need education and a large number of bills to pay at home. In this situation, what should a wife do? We believe that this is not just a woman's issue, but a social issue as a whole. In a society like this now, who can answer this question? If we are more optimistic, we can offer two points: (1) the mother finds a job; (2) the children are sent to a public school. But what if the mother cannot find a job and the children cannot find a general public free school?</p>
<p>Even if we take a step back, this problem is indeed unsolvable, especially in this money-worshiping society. Women's issues are originally part of a serious social problem!</p>
<p>However, in the hands of Hollywood writers, these serious problems are easily solved, that is, to let the wife remarry a husband. If the person she finds is not one she likes, then her children will help her to get together. And the translated title "Hard On Dad" that has been turned over by advertisers, if you look at the current plot, it would seem more accurate to change it to "Hard On Mom"!</p>
<p>Movie art, which bears the important mission of education and culture, falls into the hands of such film writers, which is indeed a cause for sighing.</p>
<p>In order to grab the audience, the playwrights had to exaggerate the form of comedy, turning Bartholomew, who has always maintained excellent performance, into a clown-like naughty child. When he questions the young lawyer about whether he has a family or is engaged, it will indeed make the audience laugh. Then add Judy Garland, who is good at singing, and that cute little brother Scotty Beckett, etc., so that this tragic story is covered up by a strong laugh.</p>
<p>The script is not very complete, and the appearance of the insurance company chairman can simply be deleted.</p>
<p>In the performance section, the director tries his best to create jokes, such as deliberately adding many small gimmicks when Brett gives a speech; Billy, etc. encounter a skunk, causing people to cover their noses and pass by; all of these serve as the center of the jokes in the whole play.</p>
<p>Bartholomew still works quite hard, but I personally feel that I don't like him playing this almost clownish role. Judy sings three or four songs in total, and the others, such as Mary Astor, who plays the mother, and Walter Pidgeon, who plays the lawyer, etc., because there are not many scenes, the impression given to people is also very weak.</p>
<h3>How to "Pass the Time"</h3>
<p>— Xin Liang</p>
<p>Everyone has "free time"; students have it after class and homework is finished, the remaining time is "free time"; workers have it after all the work is done; even petty traders who live day to day may not be without "free time," look, aren't they often playing cards on the street? Thus, even the busiest person has "free time." Because of "free time," there is what people call "passing the time," which is how to spend this "free time."</p>
<p>Speaking of "passing the time," some people may immediately think of smoking, drinking, whoring, gambling, and other bad habits, as if there were no other ways to pass the time. They all say, "It's just a little entertainment." Thus, day and night, they only know how to go to skating rinks, dog racing tracks, and dance halls to hold women and seek stimulation. This way of passing the time, is it more appropriate to say it's killing time, or is it wasting time?</p>
<p>In Shanghai, there are countless people who have fallen because they have been infected by this kind of passing the time. However, in fact, there are many other good and healthy ways to pass the time. In short, whether "passing the time" is beneficial or not depends on the individual's ideas. Below, I will introduce you to several slightly meaningful ways to pass the time, which can not only increase knowledge but also cultivate the mind and body.</p>
<p>Clipping Newspapers</p>
<p>This way of passing the time is really interesting, and its excitement is no less than playing mahjong. Or, perhaps some people will say that this kind of passing the time is too troublesome. After reading the newspaper every day, why bother cutting them into squares and pieces? You don't know that newspapers are a record of people's lives and are indeed worth cutting out and preserving. Therefore, clipping newspapers is not limited to important news, commentaries, special articles, essays, new poems, and other photos, even advertisements can be cut out and pasted in old notebooks for you to browse from time to time and treat as a kind of "passing the time." If you have your own work published in the newspaper, then this kind of newspaper clipping work will be even more interesting.</p>
<p>Collecting Stamps</p>
<p>The history of stamp collecting as a pastime in the minds of Chinese people is not long. Until recently, this interesting pastime has been transmitted from Europe and the United States, and old stamp stalls and stamp societies on the streets seem to be easier to find and more numerous. Indeed, stamp collecting is beneficial to the body and mind, especially helpful for our historical and geographical knowledge; each red and green stamp, with beautiful and moving pictures, can tell you about the customs, human feelings, geography, culture, language, and everything else in that country. Although this kind of pastime is a little more aristocratic than the previous one, and genuine stamp collecting also costs some money, the interest and benefits gained from stamp collecting can offset the price paid.</p>
<p>Needless to say, everyone knows that China today is opening up a path in a difficult environment, and this work is naturally difficult. Then, how can every citizen waste time with bad pastimes? In today's era, filled with calls for "frugality to save the country" and "donation movements," can we still tolerate those useless and harmful pastimes of whoring and gambling?</p>

<p>Chapter Six: Praising Rui's One Seed Growing Three Beautiful Flowers, Narrating Friendship, Two Talents Meeting Heroes</p>
<p>Zhu Ai'ren lived in a house with her adoptive mother, Old Doctor Zhang. The house was near the hospital, a three-story building in a semi-Western style. The house was not large, just enough to use, but the yard was not small, with some trees, rocks, and flowers. Zhu Ai'ren knew that the two Miss He's were coming, so she cleaned up two rooms next to her own room for them to live in. She had long known that they would not want to live in the Freedom Village in solitude. Even if they wanted to go to Freedom Village, it would be best if she accompanied them. Although Zhu Ai'ren's mother lived in Freedom Village, wasn't she a simple and rustic old farmer who could not deal with these two Miss He's? At this time, Zhu Ai'ren's car drove straight into the yard of her own home. At that time, the setting sun hung on the treetops, and the sky was not completely dark. In front of the steps, seven or eight people had come out to greet them. They all knew that these were Zhu Ai'ren's classmates in the United States, a pair of twin daughters surnamed He, who had just arrived from Hong Kong. Ai'ren had gone to Suzhou Station today to meet them, but the two Miss He's did not recognize who these seven or eight people who came out to greet them were. Even if Zhu Ai'ren introduced them to them one by one, they probably would not remember them clearly for a while. It turned out that most of these seven or eight people were doctors from the Women and Children's Hospital. Some lived in Old Doctor Zhang's house, and some did not live in Old Doctor Zhang's house. They heard that Zhu Ai'ren was going to pick up two new guests today, and these two new guests were a pair of twins, so they all had to come and see them. Zhu Ai'ren also briefly introduced them to the two Miss He's at the time, knowing that they would not remember them clearly for a while. Fortunately, they would be familiar with each other in a few days. The two Miss He's also went to see Old Doctor Zhang, who was also very welcoming. Because Zhu Ai'ren had told her about them long ago, knowing that they were Zhu Ai'ren's good classmates, and had said for a long time that they would come here to visit Ai'ren, she naturally had to fulfill her responsibility to entertain them. Moreover, Old Doctor Zhang was very amiable and kind, so they became very close at first sight. She said, "We have many places where we are afraid that we will not be able to entertain you well, please forgive us. Because Ai'ren and I are very busy with medical affairs. I am in charge of the entire Women and Children's Hospital and the nursery, from the general manager to the general affairs, I have to ask about everything, and I can no longer manage things like seeing patients and delivering babies. All matters concerning seeing patients and delivering babies are managed by Ai'ren, and she also has to manage these people in the Women and Children's Hospital and these children in the nursery. She is really too busy for a while. Fortunately, the two ladies are very good friends, so don't be polite. (66)</p>

<p>Now, we are even more gratified by the good news that the Chinese Air Force will be on the silver screen. Undoubtedly, it will write a brilliant page in the history of Chinese cinema.</p>
<p>Since the war, the staff of the Central Film Studio of the Central Propaganda Department have often traveled to the north, south, east, and west battlefields, and the tragic, magnificent, and touching facts of the front line have been shown to the vast audience in the rear through the lens, film, and transportation. Now, there is also a film with the theme of the air force, "A Clear Sky for Ten Thousand Miles," which will be filmed soon. The screenwriter is Mr. Sun Yu, the director of "The Road." The Central Propaganda Department had previously consulted the Aviation Committee to send personnel to jointly participate in the filming, directing, and technical work. The Aviation Committee sent the fake airman Xie Taojun to assist. Xie Jun once said:</p>
<p>"...When he (referring to Sun Yu) sincerely buried himself in the screenplay of this film, I helped him by telling him some stories about the Chinese Air Force, and various issues about air force driving and combat technology. I am a pilot, I don't know how to write a good script, but I know how to fly a plane, how to fight the enemy, and how to defend the airspace of my motherland: I want to contribute these things to the film industry. Also, I want to correctly tell the struggle, bravery, and heroic sacrifice of my partners. These are what the screenwriter is going to use as the object of his description..."</p>
<p>This film "A Clear Sky for Ten Thousand Miles" is indeed an epoch-making and great significance event in the history of Chinese cinema. Here, we pay the most sacred salute to all the staff of "A Clear Sky for Ten Thousand Miles"!</p>
<p>Looking back at our "isolated island" film industry, it is a time when the atmosphere of demons is spreading. How should the film industry workers strive to rise up at the crowing of the rooster? We should not only maintain the progressive spirit of the past, but also develop this spirit, with a new uncompromising spirit, strive to struggle, and strive to fight!</p>
<h3>Shirley Temple Happily Raises Rabbits</h3>
<p>— Bu Zhi</p>
<p>Is Shirley Temple a "genius"? No, she just has a mischievous personality like other children. However, the talents of mischievous children are probably smart. Shirley Temple's "intelligence" can be used by her environment and education, so she seems smarter than other children! If she didn't have the help of a good education and a good environment, I'm afraid that to this day, or even until she died, she might still be an unknown person, like other children who have buried their intelligence; from the perspective of determinism, Shirley Temple is indeed a lucky person in this world.</p>
<p>Shirley Temple likes to raise rabbits very much, but if you ask her "Why do you love rabbits," she can't answer, because she herself doesn't know the reason why she likes rabbits.</p>
<p>When Shirley Temple was just babbling "Papa" and "Mama," one day, her mother took her to the zoo to play. In that zoo, which displayed strange beasts and birds, her eyes were attracted by a group of colorful rabbits. She jumped in her mother's arms in surprise and joy. Why didn't she show such expressions when she saw tigers! Seeing lions, seeing jackals, wolves, leopards and elephants? Her mother thought that her daughter was destined to be with rabbits.</p>
<p>Later, at Shirley Temple's request, her mother bought many rabbit toys for her; leather, cloth, wood, and clay became decorations in her room.</p>
<p>As she grew older, a film director accidentally discovered her intelligence; she climbed onto the screen and became popular. At this time, because her monthly income was so rich, her mother built a paradise for her; everything about life, education, games, and career was prepared in detail. However, her mother forgot to open up a rabbit-raising garden for her, she didn't think that the child really wanted to raise rabbits.</p>
<p>As a result, Shirley Temple proposed</p>
<p>The first time, she only bought five rabbits. In a small corner of the garden, a small wooden shed was built to provide these five rabbits with sleep. Thus, Shirley Temple added another activity to her daily schedule; morning, evening, whether it was sunny or rainy, she had to go and see her beloved rabbits. Three months later, one morning when she went to see the rabbits again, she couldn't see any rabbits. She cried, she said that the rabbits were eaten by wild cats. But in fact, no, because the rabbits had reached the breeding season, they dug underground caves and hid in the underground to give birth to baby rabbits, so they were too lazy to come out at night.</p>
<p>Several days passed, and a large group of baby rabbits appeared in front of Shirley Temple. Breeding like this from generation to generation, now, there are hundreds of rabbits on her field, and the area of that rabbit circle has also been expanded for the sake of needs. In the past, Shirley Temple herself went to feed grass to the rabbits, but later she also hired someone to take care of the rabbits to replace her work.</p>
<p>Now, raising rabbits is very developed in Shirley Temple's career; society has given her the honorary title of "rabbit raising expert."</p>
<p>Just looking at rabbit raising, we can prove that the environment and education used Shirley Temple's intelligence to make her a lucky "genius."</p>

<h3>News from the Silver Screen</h3>
<p>— Yin Si</p>
<p>Chen Yunshang Goes and Comes Again</p>
<p>The southern beauty Chen Yunshang came to Shanghai to star in "Mulan Joins the Army," and unexpectedly her reputation spread and she became famous in one fell swoop. The second film, "Fairy Yunshang," is a new type of song and dance film, which will also be completed soon. Previously, she was originally from a song and dance troupe that had been in this field for a long time, so this film "Fairy Yunshang" is even more able to show her strengths and is another good show.</p>
<p>On the Hong Kong side, three companies, "Qiming," "Nanyang," and "Minzu," had previously signed a five-film contract with her, which she had to go back and film. Therefore, after the work on "Fairy Yunshang" is completed, she will "return to her hometown" and come back again.</p>
<p>The third film in Huacheng Company's plan, I heard, has been set as the costume film "Romance of the West Chamber," and plans to bring together three major stars—Hu Die (Yingying), Jin Yan (Zhang Sheng), and Chen Yunshang (Hongniang) to co-star. Because Hu Die is living in Hong Kong and does not want to return to Shanghai; after acting in "Yang Guifei," she will still film in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Tan Ying Moves Out of Taoyuan Village</p>
<p>Tan Ying had just moved into Taoyuan Village on Lafayette Road two months ago; her "husband" Cheng Bugao has been on a long expedition to Sichuan and Shu for many years, and had also returned to Shanghai for a trip. Recently, because the "second landlord" suddenly topped the house, changed to a new owner, and had to take it back for self-occupation, she suddenly moved the scene again to another place.</p>
<p>Finding a house is the most difficult problem at the moment. Because Tan Ying looked for it and couldn't find a suitable residence; in the absence of any way, she could only temporarily open a room in a foreign apartment on Avenue Joffre and Albert Road. At the same time, her old mother and a younger brother also rented a pavilion building for them elsewhere, as another settlement.</p>
<p>She said: "Living alone in an apartment is not only too lonely, but also extremely inconvenient. Now I still want to find a more suitable house."</p>
<p>Gu Lanjun Sells Flowers and Gives Photos</p>
<p>Gu Lanjun and her sister Mei Jun are both addicted to flowers, so for the sake of selecting relationships; they had already opened a Mei Lan flower shop at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Dahua Road, specializing in selling all kinds of beautiful flowers. Such sharing of fragrance and helping each other's beauty is such an elegant and rhythmic artist's anecdote. These days, Miss Lanjun's new film "Wu Zetian" is being shown at the Great Shanghai Theater; she is quite satisfied with this film herself, so she specially prepared a large number of Wu Zetian stills and distributed them to customers at the Mei Lan flower shop every day. According to her, "At the same time, it is also for the Mei Lan flower shop to have been open for just one year, and it is regarded as a memorial." In this way, her beautiful gift has a double meaning!</p>
<h3>Ye Sheng Lan et al.'s Strange Reunion</h3>
<p>— Xi Tong</p>
<p>Ye Sheng Lan's "Strange Reunion" is famous. I remember a few years ago, I watched him and Hua Huilin co-star in "Writing a Petition" at the Xin Guang Grand Theater, which was warm and delicate, making it difficult for me to forget until now. "Writing a Petition" happened to be scheduled after the lively martial arts show; this joy was like finding an oasis in a desert, with green grass and flowing water - this will become my eternal dream.</p>
<p>In order to pursue this dream, I specially went to the Golden Grand Theater a few days ago to watch Ye Sheng Lan and Xing Eyun co-star in the full version of Strange Reunion. (In fact, it is still only the latter version, because it starts from Crying in Prison) But such a dream can no longer be obtained! Can a big dream only be allowed to stay in memory forever, and cannot be pursued?</p>
<p>Ye Sheng Lan's advantage is: After Gui Zhi took the stage and sat down, she cried. He lowered his head slightly and stared at Gui Zhi with his eyes, so-called half-love and half-resentment, which can best express this kind of expression; I heard that the warden was opened by Gui Zhi, although he said "Hey," he still took a gentle tone in the reprimand, indicating his deep love for his wife; it wasn't until he said "How can this be" that he really got angry: like this process from joy to anger, the change is extremely natural and pleasing. Secondly, speaking of "Wait for me to go and ask her" without pulling the hem of her clothes (actually, the clothes are split in two), he just pulls the sleeve of his right hand with his left hand, and points at Gui Zhi with his right finger, which is also quite concise and emotional. Furthermore, speaking of "Your father has another way to make a living," he patted Gui Zhi's shoulder kindly, which was also very realistic. Finally, being teased by Gui Zhi, he stood up and walked in solemnly like it was a big deal, which was more interesting and novel than bending over, pointing, and saying "How can this be."</p>
<p>But Sheng Lan also has shortcomings, that is: when singing "After listening to my wife's words, my heart is bitter," the word "bitter" does not have a lingering sound. According to Cao Xinquan's score in Volume 4, Issue 12 of the Drama Learning Monthly, the gongche of this sentence's bitter word should be "shang chi gong liu chi gong liu shang chi shang si he si." (Eyun also has the same singing sentence, but she didn't make a mistake) Also, "He and I, Zhao Chong, are just as similar," the tempo seems too fast. Secondly, in the "Breakthrough" scene, crying too much is also somewhat unreal.</p>
<p>Eyun's acting is very good, her voice is also sweet, but because she has been performing "Killing the Family of Fishermen" and this play continuously, she is naturally exhausted, so she can't fully concentrate. When Sheng Lan sang the passage "After listening to my wife's words," she turned her back to the outside of the stage, which is unreasonable. If she can't hear Sheng Lan's words, then how did she say "Is your husband also driven out by his stepmother?" I think this cannot be blamed on Eyun alone. Many people who perform Peking Opera have this problem. That is, they don't treat the play as a serious art, but are casual. When A sings, B doesn't care, either drinking tea or resting, breaking the realm of integration and connection. After being pulled into the government office, Eyun's panicked expression was not fully expressed, and she should have looked dazed, not bowed.</p>
<p>Li Qi, played by Guan Shengxi, was successful, with good singing and acting, and especially good crying, but his old age was not perfect, which was a fly in the ointment.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of the Amusement World</h3>

<h3>Secret History of the Imperial Palace and Pear Garden of the Old Capital (125)</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Talking about the Relationship between Empress Dowager Cixi and An Dehai because of Visiting Her Mother's Exit from the Pass</p>
<p>The play "Silang Visits His Mother" has been popular in Bangzi and Peking Opera troupes for hundreds of years. Yu Shuyan's grandfather, Yu Sansheng, became famous for this play in the past. Later, Guo Shichen (i.e., Old Yuan Yuan Hong), the Taidou of Peking Opera with a mustache, won the appreciation of musicologists with his tragic and desolate tune. Therefore, the excerpt of "Visiting Mother" almost became a famous play known to every household in the Tongguang years. In fact, the "Visiting Mother" of the Peking Opera troupe was indeed derived from the Bangzi troupe. When the King of the Performing World, Tan Xinpei, widely adopted the strengths of various schools and formed his own school, this play became even more famous in the world; and the person he admired the most at the time, in addition to the predecessors of the Peking Opera troupe, Cheng Chang Geng, Yu Sansheng, Wang Jiuling, and others, also worshiped Guo Baochen, who was on par with him, like a heavenly god. In many of his translation tunes, we can find the charm of Bangzi opera. From this, we can guess how much he admired the sad sound of Qin Opera, and how he used his wit to extract the essence of Guo's tune and install it in the "crying head" of Xipi and other mournful sounds to stimulate the audience's hearing, often making the audience shed tears. At that time, it was collectively called the sound of national subjugation. Unexpectedly, this kind of sound of national subjugation can not only spread north and south and be popular for a while, but also endure for a long time and still be so strong today. For example, the play "Visiting Mother" has almost become the Tan School's most popular play in various theaters. Xing Eyun and Yang Shisen's trip to the south this time, in less than a month, they have repeated it three times, and each time the attendance rate is above 90%. This also shows the strong appeal of the play and the fact that people who appreciate music attach great importance to it. I have always liked to explore the relationship between the characters in the play and the history of our country. Now let me write out the name of the "Pass" in the "Exit" scene of the play "Visiting Mother" for my friends to study, and I will also incidentally narrate a secret history of the Empress Dowager Cixi of the late Qing Dynasty and the eunuch An Dehai (i.e., Little Anzi, who was very popular for a while), because the origin of Empress Dowager Cixi's favor of An Dehai was because he had risked his life to break through this pass and saved the lives of the Empress Dowager and her son, and according to an old opera fan in the military, this pass was the pass that Yang Silang passed through in those years; in fact, the story of the "Yang Family Generals" is not reliable at all, and when plays such as "Visiting Mother" and "Yanmen Pass" are choreographed, it is even more unbelievable, but people all have the common problem of "manufacturing historical sites" and "attributing words to them." Let's assume that "Yang Silang's exit from the pass to visit his mother" is a real thing, then, the inference of the old opera fan in the military can be considered quite accurate, because he is an old military man over sixty years old, who served as a platoon leader under Wu Luzhen, and later became a division commander. He not only has knowledge and loves to watch operas, but is also very familiar with history and geography. This "pass" is a place where he once lived for a long time. He inferred based on ancient and modern geography and resolutely said to me: "If Silang's exit from the pass is really such a thing, then the pass he passed through is the current Gubeikou."</p>

<h3>Finance Retail Investors Dump, Cash Price Initially Stable then Falls</h3>
<p>Falling to a Closing Price of 2058 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the spot market for "cooked red" (refined gold) was initially quite stable. Although many small investors, seeing the uncertainty in Europe, actively sold, a certain gold firm was eagerly buying, so the situation remained relatively stable. In the afternoon, the gold firm's appetite waned, and the selling pressure did not decrease, so the market weakened, falling to a closing price of 2058 yuan. As a result, it fell another eight yuan. Confidence among all parties remained weak, but trading was still active, with about 770 taels traded. Jewelry gold was also marked down by a small amount of one yuan. Customs gold remained stable. Central Bank pure gold, etc., rose slightly.</p>
<p>"Cooked Red" Falls Eight Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, no trading occurred for each bar (ten taels). Around ten o'clock, a certain silver firm sold fifty taels to a money exchange business for 2069 yuan, an opening price three yuan higher than last weekend. After the opening, the money exchange business immediately resold it to a certain gold firm at the same price. Subsequently, the silver shop group made fifty taels between themselves, and the gold firm sold fifty taels to the silver shop group, both at 69 yuan. After this, although a certain gold firm continued to buy, the money exchange business acted on behalf of local customers to sell, so the situation was slightly weak. The gold firm then bought fifty taels from a securities firm for 68 yuan. A cash shop sold twenty taels to a money exchange business for 67 yuan. Later, the gold firm bought another fifty taels from the money exchange business for 66 yuan. At that time, the money exchange business's willingness to sell waned, so the underlying trend stopped falling and turned upward. The money exchange business made fifty taels between themselves for 67 yuan. The gold firm then bought fifty taels from the money exchange business for 70 yuan. By then, it was 11:45. Near noon, the money exchange business sold another fifty taels to the silver shop group for 67.5 yuan. The underlying trend weakened again in the afternoon, due to continued active selling by retail investors and waning buying interest from gold firms. First, the money exchange business sold fifty taels to the gold firm for 64 yuan. Then, it sold another fifty taels to a fellow business for 65 yuan. Later, the money exchange business made fifty taels between themselves for 62 yuan. After a while, the money exchange business sold fifty taels to a customer for 60 yuan. By then, it was 3:45. Later, at 4:05, the money exchange business made thirty taels between themselves for 2058 yuan, the closing price for the evening, eight yuan lower than last Saturday's closing price (having fallen for three consecutive days for a total of 38 yuan), with a daily range of twelve yuan. The cash shop's own-brand gold was sold at 2065 yuan and bought at 2050 yuan. The spot gold was still quoted fifty yuan lower than the list price, but there were no trades.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Down One Yuan</p>
<p>The price of jewelry gold at silver shops was initially unchanged due to the relatively stable trend of "cooked red." Around 4:10 in the afternoon and evening, as "cooked red" weakened again, the price was also marked down by a small amount of one yuan. Da Tong Heng quoted 209 yuan, and Xin Tong Heng quoted 207 yuan, buying at 0.01 yuan less.</p>
<p>Customs Gold Unchanged</p>
<p>The Central Bank's buying price for Chinese cash has risen to 1212.6 yuan. The listed price for customs gold remained unchanged, at 2.396 yuan. The Shanghai standard spot gold price also rose by 0.3 yuan, due to London's telegram on the 18th that British pure gold rose by half a pence per ounce.</p>
<h3>Exchange Rates for British and American Currencies Rise, Buying Sentiment for US Dollars in this City Subdued</h3>
<p>The exchange market yesterday saw a sudden reversal and rise in the exchange rate between British and American currencies, which immediately subdued buying sentiment for US dollars in this city. Although foreign firms had a relatively high demand for settlements mid-day, the large influx of selling orders telegraphed from Hong Kong and the increased selling interest from foreign banks caused the situation to briefly rebound to 16.09375 yuan, but ultimately there was no significant change. Although foreign firms also came to settle British currency, the abundant supply from Hong Kong telegrams and British banks such as HSBC kept the situation quite stable, and it remained fixed at 8.25 pence. There was little change that day, and trading was still active. As for the Hong Kong exchange rate, the intense buying by foreign firms initially weakened the underlying trend to 55.125 yuan, but the increased selling interest from Chinese banks caused it to rebound to 55.25 yuan, resulting in a tightening of 0.125 compared to last weekend.</p>
<p>In the morning, London's large amounts continued to contract by 0.25 for the near term and 0.125 for the long term. New York silver prices remained stable, London bullion rose by half a penny, exchange rates for British currency against American currency rose by 0.7, against French currency rose by 0.3 centimes, and against Shanghai currency remained unchanged. American currency rose against British currency by 0.125, against French currency rose by 0.0625, and against Shanghai currency remained unchanged. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. Banks opened in the morning with selling prices of 8.25 pence for British currency and 16.0625 yuan for American currency, with no changes compared to last weekend. After the opening, although major foreign firms had some settlements, the abundant supply from foreign banks kept the situation quite stable. Foreign firms settled with HSBC for British currency at 8.25 pence and also bought US currency from a certain bank for 16.0625 yuan. HSBC's listed price remained unchanged, and the silver equalization tax announcement continued to fall by 0.0125, assessed at 5.00%. After this, a sudden influx of selling orders telegraphed from Hong Kong slightly strengthened the underlying trend. Hong Kong telegrams sold US currency to Youli for 16.09375 yuan. Subsequently, foreign firms suddenly bought Hong Kong currency intensely, causing the situation to weaken. Foreign firms bought Hong Kong currency from Netherlands Chinese Bank for 55.125 and 55.25 yuan. At the noon closing, the bank's selling price was the same as the morning opening.</p>
<p>In the afternoon market, foreign firms settled with HSBC for British currency at 8.25 pence and then bought US currency from a certain bank for 16.0625 yuan. Subsequently, Hong Kong telegrams sold British currency to Youli for 8.25 pence and US currency for 16.09375 yuan. Finally, foreign firms bought Hong Kong currency from Chinese banks for 55.25 yuan. The situation was also stable. At the evening closing, the bank's selling prices were 8.25 pence for British currency and 16.0625 yuan for American currency. As a result, compared to last Saturday's noon closing, British and American currencies remained unchanged, while Hong Kong currency weakened by 0.125.</p>
<p>Japanese Currency Widely Distributed</p>
<p>Last Saturday, British pure gold rose by half a penny, and the exchange rate between British and American currencies rose by 0.125. Yesterday, foreign exchange in this city was still in strong demand from foreign firms, and the supply from banks was very abundant. The American currency once loosened, and as a result, there was no change compared to last Saturday. The opening price of "cooked red" was still stable, but later, there was very active closing of positions. The gold firms, money exchange businesses, etc., did not absorb smoothly, and the price trend was slightly weak. In the afternoon, retail investors flooded the market more actively, and buyers became even scarcer, and the market price fell sharply, and the lowest price closed, and the trend was very weak. Due to the weakness of spot gold, British and American gold pounds were sold slightly actively, and the market price fell more. Foreign banks accepted American dollar bills quite smoothly. Due to the slightly weak confidence in foreign currencies, most of them fell. Transactions in Japanese gold notes were quite active. New notes such as one yuan and fifty sen (Japanese gold note half yuan, etc.) were widely distributed in the market, and transactions in the guild were still active. Chengtai sold and Qin Tai bought fifty American gold pounds. Changtai sold and Hongchang bought fifty British gold pounds. Dingyuan sold and Yongtai bought one hundred British gold notes.

<p>Securities: Europe Has Many Accidents, Domestic Debt Declines, More Than Two and a Half Yuan Lower Than the Highest</p>
<p>The securities market was weak. Due to the tense situation in Europe, many superficial bulls flocked to sell, so the market price has been depressed for several days, falling by more than 2.5 yuan compared to the highest price. Both types have broken the 50 yuan mark. If the European situation shows any signs of improvement, the market price may rebound.</p>
<p>Yesterday's progress: No. 16 and Tiansheng Lemao, etc., sold at the opening, while Maoda and Tongkang were the buyers. Large investors were not active, and the market price tended to be weak.

<h3>Metals Raw Lead and Iron Face Spot Shortages</h3>
<p>Raw lead and iron have traditionally been mostly sold to factories in this street. Over the past week, merchants from Tianjin have been frantically purchasing them because the exchange rate is favorable, with more than a thousand boxes traded. The price has risen from 42 yuan to 45 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Alarming Surge in the Price of Single Yarn</h3>
<p>32-Count "Celestial Maiden" Jumps 20 Yuan</p>
<p>The yarn market remains stable, but the price of 32-count fine yarn is surging dramatically, with a momentum rarely seen in the market. This is mainly due to the spring and summer season, which has slightly increased demand in the Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Hunan areas. Furthermore, traders, seeing the shortage of spot goods and the small number of spindles in operation at the factories, are pushing up the price even more vigorously, frantically searching for it in the market. As a result, the market price is mutually raised higher. The price of 32-count "Celestial Maiden" single yarn has jumped by 20 yuan, to 570 yuan. It is found that the price of 42-count "Celestial Maiden" double-ply yarn is instead 545 yuan, 25 yuan lower than the price of single yarn. The situation suggests that someone is manipulating it. However, this kind of surge is too violent. According to the market, factories are all switching to spinning single yarn because the price of 20-count yarn is mediocre. It is important to guard against a reversal in the future. Moreover, it is found that last year, the highest peak price of 32-count single yarn was 570 yuan, at which time the price of 20-count yarn was around 480 yuan. Based on this situation, it is inevitable that yarn factories will switch to spinning single yarn. In the afternoon, the price of 32-count "Celestial Maiden" single yarn rose another 3 yuan, to 573 yuan, a surge of more than 21 yuan compared to Saturday.</p>
<p>The situation for spot yarn: At the opening in the morning, traders gathered and found the yarn market still calm. However, the demand for fine yarn, 32-count, from the Zhejiang area was brisk, causing tension in the market. The opening price of 32-count "Shepherd" was 6 yuan higher than the previous day. In a flash, it jumped 20 yuan. The price of 20-count yarn was boosted by 1 yuan due to the sharp rise in the price of single yarn. The price of 20-count "Double Horse" was 366 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 392.5 to 393 yuan. In the afternoon, the yarn market rose slightly by 0.5 yuan, but the price of single yarn rose another 3 yuan. It is found that the total amount bought by various traders throughout the day was 1,905 bales. Market prices: 20-count "Double Horse" yarn rose by 2 yuan, and the rest also rose by 1.1 to 1.2 yuan, but the prices of 32-count and 42-count fine yarn rose by 5 yuan to 20 yuan. The amounts of spot yarn bought by various traders are recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Fellow traders: 1,115; Ningdu: 80</p>
<p>Shantou: 185; Hong Kong: 32</p>
<p>Fuzhou: 25; Yunnan: 110</p>
<p>Hunan: 30; Xiamen: 30</p>
<p>Inland: 20; Total: 1,905</p>
<p>The situation in the Japanese yarn market turned weak, due to selling by traders from Tianjin in the north, dropping slightly by 1 yuan. The spot price of 20-count "Water Moon" yarn was 340 to 339 yuan, and the spot price of 20-count "Blue Phoenix" yarn was 330 to 329 yuan. Demand from other areas was very low.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 385 bales of exported cotton yarn were shipped to Shantou, 285 bales to Hong Kong, 175 bales to Guangzhou Bay, and 595 bales to Haiphong. Today, 820 bales will be shipped to Shantou, 70 bales to Hong Kong, and 50 bales to Fuzhou.</p>
<h3>Egyptian Cotton Plummets Seven Yuan</h3>
<p>Manufacturers Still Watching, Local Cotton Business Turns Quiet</p>
<p>The prices of foreign cotton have long been observed by this newspaper. Yesterday's price drop in New York was affected by the serious situation in Europe, but the main reason was actually the widespread rumors of the release of loan cotton and the government's adoption of export subsidies for cotton. As a result, traders were extremely panicked, and various parties sold off, causing cotton prices to feel quite weak, falling by 7 to 13 pence per pound. Due to the sharp drop in Liverpool and the news of the release of American loan cotton, combined with forecasts, Indian cotton plummeted by more than 3 rupees. Egyptian cotton plummeted by more than 70 pounds. Yesterday, the exchange rate loosened slightly. Converted to legal tender, cotton prices fell by 1.1 yuan per dan (unit of weight) for American and Brazilian cotton, 1.35 yuan per dan for Indian cotton, and a sharp drop of more than 7 yuan per dan for Egyptian cotton.</p>
<p>The Shanghai market for foreign cotton: Factories did not buy because of the sharp drop in foreign cotton prices, and various parties planned to watch the overseas cotton market for a considerable period of time. However, yesterday's price of fine yarn soared, and Tianjin's fine velvet cotton, although offered at a good price, was still purchased from the south. Therefore, it is expected that factories will slightly purchase long-staple foreign cotton within the day. Yesterday's foreign cotton prices are recorded below:</p>
<p>Raw Material  Category  Delivered to Factory, Including Tax</p>
<p>60-Count Egyptian Cotton, High Grade 104.05</p>
<p>Same, Middle Grade 101.10</p>
<p>80-Count, High Grade 127.45</p>
<p>Same, Middle Grade 117.30</p>
<p>20-Count American Upland 83.70</p>
<p>Same, Low Grade 70.60</p>
<p>32-Count, 92.45</p>
<p>Same, Low Grade 81.55</p>
<p>42-Count, 94.25</p>
<p>Same, Low Grade 82.45</p>
<p>South American Brazilian Cotton, High Grade 99.10</p>
<p>Same, Middle Grade 84.95</p>
<p>Same, Low Grade 78.30</p>
<p>10-Count Indian Pingguoer 60.45</p>
<p>16-Count Indian Omra 65.25</p>
<p>20-Count, 69.35</p>
<p>24-Count Indian Bairuche 76.00</p>
<p>32-Count American Xin te 81.95</p>
<p>32-Count, 42-Count American Pengjiapu 86.40</p>
<p>The local cotton business has turned quiet, really because prices are too high, and the prices of American and Indian cotton cloth have fallen sharply again, causing calculation prices to become cheaper day by day. Manufacturers are naturally choosing the cheaper options over the expensive ones, and the position of local cotton has mostly been encroached upon by them. However, the amount of local cotton in stock is not enough to supplement it. The market price of cotton traded yesterday was still as firm as ever and never loosened. The source of supply from the Subei area is still low, with a total of 555 bales of Nantong fine velvet cotton. The sales market prices and amounts of spot cotton are listed on the left:</p>
<p>Nantong Cotton 80.00 yuan; Yuanyihao bought 103 bales; exchange transfer, warehouse delivery</p>
<p>Changshu Ink Seed 74.00 yuan; Fellow trader bought 400 bales; same</p>
<p>Fire Machine Cotton 71.00 yuan; Same, 102 bales; cash, same</p>
<p>Same, 71.50 yuan; Same, 20 bales; same</p>
<p>Industry and Commerce Discussion</p>
<h3>Don't Go for Cheap Deals Anymore, Honestly Switch to Wearing Domestic Cloth</h3>
<p>— Fushi</p>
<p>I have been an employee in the woolen industry for nearly thirty years, from apprentice to now. I don't know how many changes the woolen industry has gone through. To put it simply, it is just as Mr. Zhifeng said in the previous Japanese publication "From a Historical Perspective, Talking About the Shanghai Woolen Industry." Later, this publication also published Mr. Tang Jun's "The Woolen Industry Cannot but Plan for Itself," which made me very emotional. Even those in the woolen industry feel the same way, so I will dissect it to clarify the situation.</p>
<p>(1) Since the Japanese disguised as "Allied Bank" issued counterfeit currency to seize legal tender and exchange it for foreign exchange, the authorities had no choice but to implement foreign exchange controls. Woolen imports have become difficult. 95 out of 100 cases are settled through HSBC Bank (according to the Central Bank, each national currency yuan is 1 shilling and 2.5 pence, while HSBC Bank only settles at 8.5 pence), causing the cost to suddenly increase by more than one-third (i.e., before the war, the cost per yard was 6 yuan, now it is 8.35 yuan). How can the price of goods not skyrocket? Moreover, at the beginning of the war, in order to stabilize their businesses, woolen traders sought to cancel orders that had already been placed, and either postponed or temporarily stored those that had already been shipped in Hong Kong. No one could have imagined that the market in the isolated island last year would develop so abnormally. Although woolen goods had been ordered, the number was limited, and distant water cannot quench immediate thirst, resulting in a panic situation of demand exceeding supply. At that time, the standard market price was like gold, rising three or four times a day, and it was stated that all transactions were in cash. Therefore, after the big end of last year, all stores, large and small, made money. This is not unique to the woolen industry. Moreover, the woolen industry's profits last year were certainly not exactly as reported in this newspaper. There are bound to be some discrepancies. We can only take it as a general idea.</p>
<p>(2) Mr. Tang Jun said: The cheerful faces of the woolen industry last year were due to the generosity of neighboring gangs, and also said that they did not distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, which is a bit too much. This is what is called knowing only one thing and not knowing the other. It is found that the traders with the most profits last year were the "split cargo" gangs, such as Meifa Lianxing, Yichangtai, Shengda, Wangxingchang, and Yuchangxiang, etc. Not a single inch of enemy goods entered their doors. Even high-end clothing stores also abandoned them. Let's go back to the topic. Some sales are the result of stores catering to customers' psychology of seeking cheap deals, only listening to the price, only looking at the patterns, and not asking about the quality of the fabric or the durability of the goods. Naturally, inferior goods are the most suitable for sales. If we want to say it strictly, we can say that there would be no buying without selling, and indeed the seller is not innocent. But turning it around, if everyone does not buy cheap goods, the seller will have no way to sell and will not want to sell. Therefore, it can be said that both the buyer and the seller are equally guilty.</p>
<p>(3) On the other hand, the people on the isolated island are a mixed bag. Seeing that others were making money easily, long-established stores with reputations, such as Mou Tai, Mou Xiang, Mou Feng, and Mou Ji, as well as famous brokers and runners, such as Lu, Xia, Zhang, Chen, Yang, Cao, and others, were blinded by profit for a time and did not ask whether the goods they were promoting were woven from fresh blood and severed limbs. Because of the weakness of human beings to covet small profits, they made their fortunes at the expense of friends and family, pleasing the enemy and hurting loved ones. This is why I admire Mr. Tang Jun's conclusion, and I earnestly hope that those in the industry who know their future happiness will quickly turn back, repent of their past mistakes, and think about the future of the entire nation and themselves. Do not only care about immediate interests and disregard the dangers and worries of the future. Open the window and speak frankly: those who already have considerable profits and assets should quickly wash their hands and stop doing things that sell out the happiness of their descendants. However, the ordinary small employees in the woolen industry still have a bowl of bitter rice to eat, but they are full of national consciousness and arouse conscience, unwilling to covet cheap deals, unwilling to get rich, unwilling to send money to others, and unwilling to make guns and cannons to attack our hometown.</p>
<p>(4) I would like to give a sincere advice to people from all walks of life: when buying or ordering Chinese and Western clothing woolens, please specify domestic products (most domestic woolens have a proof stamp on the selvage), pay attention to the "Yang Meiren" brand, and Yongxing Hongkang woolens are mostly woven in Shanghai, but are operated by people from a certain country. The store calls them "our factory goods." In short, do not covet cheap deals to avoid being fooled. As the saying goes, "Buy a cheap old ox, and two will fall in a year." If economic reasons make it impossible to afford durable Western woolens, it is better to honestly switch to wearing domestic cloth, which is most generous, most economical, and most durable. People will not make faces when they see it, and will even commend you as a thorough young patriotic person.</p>
<h3>Textiles Ningbo Exchange Rate Suddenly Rises, Purchase of Cloth Suddenly Weakens</h3>
<p>Dyed Goods Are Strong, Large Quantities of Cloth Exported Yesterday and Today</p>
<p>The market for domestic cloth and dyed goods is strong. Lun Chang white dyed satin and white dyed croquet silk each rose by 0.1 yuan per bolt. Summer goods have opened, and printed non-fading linen is 14.4 yuan, and linen spinning is 13.8 yuan. Stores in this street have already started to purchase them. Traders from Hunan and Jiangxi are very active in purchasing colored cloth and dyed cloth. Fuchou is particularly active, totaling more than 4,000 bolts, most of which are transshipped from Wenzhou. Wenzhou traders have added more than 100 pieces of fine cloth of the Fugui and Jinfeng brands, and 200+ boxes of Fuchou, dyed cloth, dyed twill, colored cloth, and colored twill. The Ningbo traders have recently seen the Shanghai exchange rate suddenly rise to 23 yuan per 1,000 yuan, raising the cost of goods from Shanghai and making sales difficult, so their purchasing appetite has suddenly weakened. They have only purchased more than 100 pieces of scattered fine cloth, fine twill, Fuchou, and other goods. Guangdong traders are relatively active in purchasing colored twill, with 170-180 boxes traded. The selling price of white goods alone has increased slightly for fine cloth and fine twill, by 0.05 yuan. The price of coarse cloth remains stable.</p>
<p>Due to the continued popularity of dyeing and sales, the selling price of Dong Pi white goods is strong. Yesterday, the amount of fine cloth and fine twill added by the colored cloth shops and dye factories in this street reached about 1,000 pieces. Tianjin traders also purchased more than 400 pieces of fine cloth, with one brand of colored ball fine cloth accounting for 200 pieces. Therefore, traders unanimously expect the price to rise. Rixin Foreign Firm offered 300+ pieces of fine cloth for this month and next month, with the leading price being 12.15 yuan per bolt for Yang He and 12.2 yuan for Dongmian Foreign Firm. Dongmian Foreign Firm offered 200+ bales of "Double Fish" fine twill and "Blue Chicken" fine cloth, with the "Double Fish" twill being 11.5 yuan and the "Blue Chicken" cloth being 12 yuan per bolt.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 200 pieces of textiles were exported to Shantou, 500 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, 465 pieces to Haiphong. And today, 2,400 pieces will be shipped to Tianjin, 540 pieces to Yantai, 110 pieces to Fuzhou, 740 pieces to Shantou, and 25 pieces to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Unmarked Goods Cannot Be Trusted, Marked Goods Become Popular</h3>
<p>The woolens with Western characters on the selvage have become even more popular recently. Previously, they were limited to Western-style suits, but today they are popular for Chinese clothing materials. Looking at the clothing stores, woolen stores, and silk and satin shops along Avenue Joffre, Szechuan Road, Da Xin Street, Jing'an Temple Road, Nanking Road, and Honan Road, almost none of them do not sell woolens with characters. Taking the 42,000 number flannel as an example, the same quality costs 8 yuan per yard wholesale without characters, but 8.5 yuan with characters. And sales are more popular than those without characters, because they are easy to identify, which shows the determination of people to not use inferior goods.</p>
<h3>Food Wheat Flour Mostly Shipped North</h3>
<p>Flour Market Little Falls on Plant Prices with Ocean Wheat Futures Trading a Ship</p>
<p>The wheat flour market has turned weak and falling, not only wholesale but also retail is not as lively as the previous two days. It is heard that the Nanyang gang, Quanzhou and other places, because a certain party has an attempt to move up Jinjiang, ships entering and exiting are inconvenient, so the demand is not strong, and the North Ocean gang is also affected by foreign flour, and actual sales are difficult to develop, and as a result, the price is reduced by five points, which started greed from the local guest, accounting for about 45,000 bags of flour of brands No. 2, 3 and 4, etc., No. 2 flour is all 4.65 yuan for the local guest, No. 3 flour is 4.6 yuan, No. 4 flour is 4.3 yuan, and No. 5 white bags are 3.8 to 4.6 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 4,500 bags of flour were shipped to Shantou, and today 18,000 bags were shipped to Tianjin, 7,000 bags to Yantai, 5,000 bags to Weihaiwei, and 8,000 bags to Fuzhou. In addition, 700 bags of wheat bran were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The wheat market remains stagnant. Occasionally, there are sporadic arrivals, which are all taken by Japanese factories, or directly sent to the factory for pricing. There is no formal market. Only in the midst of the competition of foreign flour and wheat, futures have been traded repeatedly. Yesterday, it was heard that the street area has newly set up a ship of Australian wheat, totaling 7,000 tons, with a price of only 7.78 yuan, and the rumor that the flour factory continued to set up two ships of foreign wheat can also be confirmed.</p>
<h3>河下 Rice Prices Rebound; Rumors of Orders for Foreign Rice</h3>
<p>Yesterday, various merchant groups brought in a total of ten shipments from He Xia, with over two thousand packages transported by carts. The early market maintained some momentum from previous days and continued to show strong demand. Prices for thick and thin japonica rice increased by a few cents. In the evening market, speculators ceased their activities, and sales on this street also slackened, causing the market to turn sluggish. Du Yangjian rice and port japonica rice, along with Yuan rice variants, saw similar supply and demand, with no significant gains or losses.</p>
<p>Locally produced Xian rice saw strong demand from both retail customers and speculators. However, prices in Wuhu, the production area, were high, leading to an initial price increase of ten to twenty cents in the morning. Subsequently, large-scale speculators took profits and sold off their holdings, causing prices to fall back down in the afternoon. Ultimately, the increase was only a few cents.</p>
<p>The current price of foreign rice is stable at seventeen yuan and twenty cents, with little fluctuation. The market should be able to maintain this level for a while. However, since the sharp rise in the price of local Yuan rice, prices have been more prone to increase than decrease, remaining at the high level of around nineteen yuan for a long time. Therefore, it was rumored yesterday that grain merchants have ordered a total of 400 tons of Hong Kong foreign Yuan rice, glutinous rice, and green beans. It is said that the shipment can be registered within the week and 1,650 bags will be shipped from Hong Kong on the 20th.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Daily Silk Prices Fluctuate Wildly; Limited Silk Transactions in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market in Yokohama continued to decline. The spot price was 1,035 yuan, a decrease of ten yuan from the weekend. The forward price was 968 yuan, a decrease of twenty-one yuan from Saturday. This shows that the fluctuations in the Eastern market are entirely caused by manipulation and speculation. Therefore, the price increases cannot be sustained for long, and the price decreases have no standard. It is regrettable that the local silk market has not been able to seize this opportunity and utilize it to promote exports. As a result, the recent rise and fall in the silk market in Yokohama (on the 17th and 18th of this month) has had little impact on the local market, which can only watch passively. The New York market was closed yesterday, and it is predicted that silk prices will also fall. This can be seen from the fact that the recent upward trend in forward silk prices has been weak, and the declines have been more severe. Furthermore, since the sudden increase in tensions in Europe, the sales of silk fabrics in Europe and America have been affected, indirectly suppressing the rise in silk prices.</p>
<p>Transactions in the local silk market are limited. Foreign firms are offering 1,730 yuan for Grade B78 white filature silk, but it is still difficult to close deals. Users are also hesitant to buy. Overall, people are taking a wait-and-see approach and not engaging in transactions for the time being. Therefore, the dry cocoon market price has also declined somewhat. The current asking price for local varieties is 310 yuan, and for foreign varieties, it is 410 yuan. Recently, there have been few buyers of raw silk. Yesterday, only the print shop made five loads of Zhejiang silk, it is said.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: No Changes in Sugar; Over 5,200 Bags Arrive</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were no significant changes in the sugar market. The public association set a price of sixteen yuan and six cents for 24 lots of coarse white re-exported goods, but no transactions were made. Taikoo Grade B West Warehouse sugar was priced at twenty-four yuan and seven cents, and East Warehouse sugar was priced at six cents. National sugar included 50 packages of Chaozhou Xinghua and other local grades of top-quality ice white sugar, priced at twenty-three yuan and seven cents; 60 packages of ordinary Huanggang Qing sugar, priced at fifteen yuan; and a lower grade priced at fourteen yuan and eight cents. 60-odd packages of Mingjing red sugar were priced at fifteen yuan and three cents. 50-odd packages of Xinghua foreign sugar were priced at sixteen yuan and three cents. 40 packages of assorted second-grade white sugar were priced at eighteen yuan and two cents to eighteen yuan. Arrivals included 300 packages of carted white sugar and 310 packages of red sugar from Xiamen, 1,000 packages of carted white sugar from Hong Kong, and over 400 packages of Pianqing sugar traded in the dark at a price of eleven yuan and eight cents.</p>
<p>85 packages of sugar arrived from Beihai on the 20th; 2,400 packages arrived from Hong Kong; 2,185 packages arrived from Shantou; and 610 packages arrived from Xiamen.</p>
<h3>Oilseed Cakes: No Deals Unless Prices are Low; Groundnut Oil Market Declines Suddenly</h3>
<p>Soybean Oil Initially Tight, then Eases; Small Soybean Cakes Flood the Market, Prices Remain the Same</p>
<p>Groundnut Oil: Yesterday, the groundnut oil market saw hints that shipments could arrive in Shanghai on the same day. However, bulls claimed that this was unfounded. Buyers were only willing to purchase at low prices, causing some people to panic. As a result, ten barrels of Dalian groundnut oil were sold at a price of thirty-eight yuan and fifty cents, a decrease of one yuan and fifty cents from the previous market. 50 pieces of Jiaozhou groundnut oil were sold at a price of twenty-nine yuan, a sharp drop of two yuan from last Saturday.</p>
<p>Soybean Oil: Due to the relatively stable situation in Dalian, the local market has not seen significant changes for the time being. The market was initially tight, then eased yesterday, with little overall fluctuation. The entire situation still depends on Dalian. Yesterday, 120 pieces of Yanqi oil were offered at a price of twenty-three yuan and four cents. There are currently 300 barrels of Dalian oil (details in the market price section); 300 barrels for delivery in seven days; 400 barrels for delivery in late March; over 1,000 barrels for delivery in April; and 200 barrels for delivery in May. 30 barrels of Fengnian oil and 100 barrels of bleached oil were also offered.</p>
<p>Soybean Cake: A flood of small Jiangbei soybean cakes arrived, with prices showing some differentiation. Other varieties saw very little change. 600 pieces of Dayou Four Brand cake were sold at a price of three yuan, forty-six cents, and four-sevenths cents. 500 pieces of Jiangbei small cake were sold at a price of three yuan and six cents. 5,000 pieces of Dalian Guang cake for delivery in April and May were sold at a price of three yuan, one cent, and five cents.</p>
<p>Today, 1,000 pieces of soybean cake will be shipped to Fuzhou and 5,000 pieces to Shantou.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 1,340 bags of soybeans were shipped to Hong Kong. Today, 1,500 bags will be shipped to Shantou and 2,250 bags to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Introduction: Daily Use Economics Monthly</h3>
<p>The first issue of Volume 1, edited by Mr. Wang Yunbo, has been published. It includes articles by Mr. Zhou Xianwen on economics, academics, and daily life, all of which are practical and informative. It is published by the American Global Trust Company, it is said.</p>
<p>Common Knowledge of the Yarn Industry</p>
<h3>The Inside Story of Cash Transactions: The Issue of Delivery</h3>
<p>— Written by Long Jusheng</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "Every magician knows tricks, but each has different skills." The business strategies in industry and commerce are as unpredictable and elusive. How much more so is the yarn industry, the "favored child of heaven," where cash transactions are intricate and complex! Like gold, it is "as precious as gold"! Like the "Eight Trigrams Formation" of Zhuge Liang in a dazzling array!</p>
<p>Having been in the yarn industry for over ten years, I am deeply familiar with the tricks of the trade. Therefore, I will describe "The Inside Story of Cash Transactions: The Issue of Delivery," which I hope will be of interest to those engaged in or concerned about this industry!</p>
<p>(1) Warehouse Receipt Goods</p>
<p>The price of warehouse receipt goods is two or three yuan lower than spot goods (also known as "gate pass goods"), and can even differ by as much as ten yuan per piece. Although customers still need to advance funds, some pay 70% in cash and 30% by remittance, while others pay 70% by remittance and 30% in cash. The more cash paid (or if it's all cash), the cheaper the price will be. Conversely, even for the same warehouse receipt goods, the price will be higher! This is because of discounting. Manufacturers treat warehouse receipt goods in two ways: (A) If the market price is low when the customer (yarn dealer) submits an order, it must be combined with higher-priced goods. (B) If the customer does not advance funds and take delivery within one week, the order will be canceled or assigned to another customer. (C) If the customer delays advancing funds and exchanging the warehouse receipt (for two or three days) after placing an order, the deposit will be forfeited. In short, there is no guarantee of obtaining spot goods with warehouse receipt goods (unless you pay an additional fee to exchange for gate pass goods, also known as "drawing cash"). Therefore, the purchase and sale of "warehouse receipt goods" is not very popular when the market is hot.</p>
<p>(2) Gate Pass Goods</p>
<p>These are goods for which the warehouse receipt has been exchanged for a manufacturer's gate pass (a warehouse certificate for immediate delivery), which can be delivered at any time. It is also known as "drawing cash." The price is five or six yuan to ten yuan higher than warehouse receipt goods. Those who are resourceful and have connections with the manufacturer can often foresee a rapid upward trend in the market and buy large quantities of warehouse receipt goods. They then pay a "cash extraction fee" to the manufacturer to obtain a gate pass and take delivery of spot goods, thereby taking the opportunity to speculate and profit. (Note that gate pass goods also require a gate pass number for allocation).</p>
<p>(3) New and Old Warehouse Receipts</p>
<p>The distinction between new and old warehouse receipts depends on the time the warehouse receipt was issued, not on whether the payment has been made, as Mr. A stated. Once a manufacturer's warehouse receipt has been obtained, the payment must have already been made. If the payment has not been made, the warehouse receipt cannot be obtained. The manufacturer's business practice is "payment first, then issuance of the receipt (warehouse receipt)," which is stricter than other industries, with no flexibility for "receipt first, payment later." Although "old warehouse receipts" can request delivery first, those purchased at a lower price will still be delivered later. Conversely, "new warehouse receipts" purchased at a higher price can still be delivered earlier.</p>
<p>(4) Approved Receipts</p>
<p>"Approved receipts" refer to situations where the customer has a "special relationship" with the manufacturer, and the head of the manufacturer's sales department or the managing director allows the warehouse receipt to be stamped with a special approval, ordering the manufacturer to deliver the goods earlier based on the approval and signature. Other customers often protest and make a fuss when they hear about this, but because the manufacturer's authority is supreme, there is nothing the customers can do.</p>
<p>As for Mr. A's statement that "if there is no one to receive gate pass goods on the market, the deliverer has no choice but to transfer them to a warehouse, incurring additional warehousing fees and labor costs..." that is not necessarily true. Those who take delivery of "gate pass spot goods" must already have a buyer, or the payment has been received and the goods are loaded onto a ship. Before the war, the shipping documents and insurance policies would be pledged to the bank to offset the debts and claims between the two parties. Therefore, "gate pass delivery" does not necessarily mean that there is no buyer. If we are talking about speculators hoarding goods, then naturally they must store them in a warehouse. After storing the goods in a warehouse, they can use the warehouse receipt to obtain a loan from a financial institution, use the loan funds to purchase more cotton yarn, and wait for a good price to sell it. This is like using one set of capital for two different purposes. If the opportunity is right and the market price is high, they can sell the goods immediately and make multiple profits, deducting warehousing costs and loan interest. A resourceful and skilled cotton yarn merchant can become wealthy with a single move. As the saying goes, "Long sleeves are good for dancing, and a good merchant is wealthy." The intricacies and unpredictable changes of the inside story are truly miraculous. It is truly "Every magician knows tricks, but each has different skills!"</p>
